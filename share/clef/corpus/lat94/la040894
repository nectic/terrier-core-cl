SCREEN STYLE / BETTY GOODWIN: CLOTHES-MINDED BIT OF FRIVOLITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 The Series: "The House of Eliott" (4 p.m. Sundays, Arts & Entertainment 
channel). 
</P>
<P>
 The Setup: Third and final installment of the BBC series that follows sisters 
Beatrice (Stella Gonet) and Evangeline (Louise Lombard, pictured above at left 
with Gonet) Eliott, couturiers and party animals in 1920s London. 
</P>
<P>
 The Costume Designer: BBC staff designer Joan Wadge. 
</P>
<P>
 The Look: A weekly feast of flapper frivolities. Think of it as "Dallas" with 
spit curls. Running a fashion house, Beatrice and Evangeline have a 
professional duty to dress stylishly day and night. The wonder is in the sheer 
size of their wardrobes -- each character has an average of 14 changes per 
hourlong episode. Even an ordinary day at the office might involve a belted, 
hip-length sweater paired with a short skirt, a rope of amber beads and 
dangling earrings. And should they walk out the front door, add a fur-trimmed 
coat, gloves and cloche. 
</P>
<P>
 Hit: The beaded dresses Beatrice and Evangeline wear with a vengeance on their 
evening rounds. They have an authentically rich look, and they are authentic, 
sort of. Many are made from original period beaded panels that are dyed and 
patched together into chemise shapes. 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia: Although Charles (Bill Thomas), the little cutter in the House of 
Eliott workroom, wears original suits from the '20s, Beatrice's strapping 
husband, Jack Maddox (Aden Gillett), can't. Like many modern men, he pumps 
iron, which makes his shoulders and arms too large for period clothing. His 
suits and dinner jackets are custom-made. 
</P>
<P>
 Quoted: "We chose the '20s because the fashion was so good and, surprisingly, 
many couturiers were women. It was a period of great change for women, the 
biggest change being that they got out of corsets. It was also a time when 
conspicuous consumption was just horrendous. There was great wealth and great 
poverty. Some women would spend as much on a jacket as other people would have 
to live on for a year," said Jean Marsh, the show's host and co-creator. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources: Principals' costumes, including hats, were custom-made at Cosprop in 
London. Jewelry is both period and costume. Marsh's clothes are mostly from 
Barneys New York.

INSIDE OUT / NOTES FROM THE STYLE FRONT: TEDDIES, GARTERS AND CLEAVAGE -- OH, 
MY! 
</P>

 Lingerie manufacturers and their publicists have declared April 10-16 to be 
"Lingerie Week." This is all well and good for women who need seven days to 
ponder the cosmic significance of the teddy.  
</P>
<P>
 We, however, have seen the light, prompted by Mr. Inside Out's suggestion that 
we trade our shapeless sweats for something a little easier on the eyes. (Such 
sexist pandering is normally beneath us, but when he said, "Shop!" we blurted: 
"How high?") 
</P>
<P>
 Our search for semi-provocative TV-watching ensembles led us to Michael Kors' 
stretchy velvet tank dresses, bias-cut gowns and handsome black flannel robes 
piped in silk (available at Bullock's). Very simple, very classy.  
</P>
<P>
 And that -- according to a survey conducted on the eve of Lingerie Week by the 
Intimate Apparel Council -- is exactly what most men say they prefer. Of 
course, 75% of these guys admit to loving garter belts and a whopping 97% are 
coo-coo for cleavage. But we're sure they mean very simple garter belts and 
very classy cleavage. . . . 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 When There's No Time to Cook Because You've Been at the Beauty Parlor All Day: 
The image-conscious clientele at Jose Eber in Beverly Hills are paragons of 
self-discipline. Shoving a rich dessert, even a healthy one, down their 
swan-like throats isn't easy. 
</P>
<P>
 I can't eat dairy, they protest when offered a slice of chocolate raspberry 
cake from the salon's Planet Earth cafe. "There's no dairy," Candace Farrell 
assures them. I can't eat sugar, they wail. "There's no sugar," she answers. I 
can't eat fats. "There are only two grams!" Clearly, the salon is a perfect 
testing ground for Planet Earth's gourmet spa cuisine. 
</P>
<P>
 Low cal, we hear, is also key to the Italian menu at Umberto's soon-to-open 
takeout spot near his flagship Canon Drive beauty salon. "Umberto's first love 
is hair, but his hobby is cooking Italian food," says salon coordinator Babette 
Beja while sampling a plate of Umberto-style pasta. "The recipes are 
old-fashioned but lighter. Less meat, stock instead of olive oil." 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, and hold the mousse. 
</P>

<P>
 What About Flared?: In our rush to scoop up the week's trendiest magazines, we 
accidentally bought a copy of Face (an overpriced guide to fashion and beauty 
for Asian American women), instead of the Face (an overpriced guide to British 
bohemia). Just past "Confessions of a Phone Sex Slave" was a fascinating 
discourse on the art of Chinese face reading. Even our nostrils, face reader 
Lillian Lesefko says, have a story to tell. 
</P>
<P>
 People with large nostrils, "Watch out! You spend money easily," Lesefko 
warns. "But if the nostrils are large and narrowed, you want value for your 
money." The smaller the nostril, the tighter the fist. 
</P>
<P>
 We wondered how Lesefko might analyze Laura Hart, the facial exercise guru who 
credits her Face Life regime (available on videotape) with giving her brighter 
eyes, fuller lips and "two almond-shaped nostrils"? With suspicion, we'd think. 
</P>

 Lane and Kent: As intrepid reporter Lois Lane, actress Teri Hatcher wears a 
closetful of curvy, idiosyncratic suits from L.A. designer Margi Kent's Vintage 
Collection. As a real-life bride next month, Hatcher will also wear a Kent 
design. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're really excited," said Kent, who was working on the gown's neckline at 
her Melrose Avenue studio Wednesday. "She wanted something simple and elegant. 
And, of course, we specialize in timeless designs, so that's perfect." 
Hatcher's long gown is cut on the bias and is made of a fabric with a soft 
sheen. More than that, Kent won't say. 
</P>
<P>
 The designer did tell us she isn't responsible for the gown Lois Lane wears to 
wed Lex Luthor in the season finale of "Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of 
Superman." The traditional gown -- "not Teri's personal style" -- came out of 
stock.

 Does Cat Woman Know About This?: A company that provides feline cadavers to 
college and university labs wants to buy thousands of L.A.'s euthanized cats. 
And Mimi Robins, city animal regulation commission president, likes the idea.  
</P>
<P>
 "If I were a cat," she told City News Service, "I would rather be used for 
something (useful)."  
</P>
<P>
 Currently, it seems, the Animal Regulation Department pays another company "an 
exorbitant amount" to dispose of the bodies of unwanted animals. The bodies are 
ground up for use in fertilizers and, uh, cosmetics. We're not going to think 
about that one minute more.

 Shoe-In: Ever hankered for a pair of Vanna White's pumps? Billy Ray Cyrus' 
white Reebok high-tops? How about legendary ballerina Natalia Makarova's satin 
pointe shoes? All of them are up for grabs, along with the shoes of more than 
50 other celebrities, at an auction April 11-16 at Macy's in San Francisco's 
Union Square.  
</P>
<P>
 We're fantasizing about Jane Russell's powder-puff mules. Proceeds from the 
auction go to a nonprofit dance company, Dance Through Time, and bidders are 
promised anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
 Sounds like an invitation for shoe aficionados such as former Marla Maples 
Trump publicist Chuck Jones, who has admitted a "sexual fascination" with 
women's shoes. Jones was sentenced Wednesday to prison for stealing dozens of 
pairs of panties, shoes and boots belonging to Mrs. Trump. Marla, incidentally, 
didn't contribute any shoes to the auction. Word is, she's busy restocking her 
closets.

 The Rich Are Different From You and Me: You can find us most nights glued to 
Court TV's coverage of the juicy Orange County palimony trial involving Claire 
Maglica and her ersatz "husband," flashlight millionaire Anthony Maglica.  
</P>
<P>
 We'll never forget Claire's masterful handling of a pesky American Express 
bill for an amount so large it had accrued $11,000 in interest. The charges 
were for clothes sent to her from that consummate '80s shopping pavilion, Torie 
Steele. Claire simply told the bothersome creditor that she couldn't possibly 
pay her debt because she had no assets -- neither car, nor home, nor job. 
</P>
<P>
 Gosh, why didn't we think of that when we foolishly ran up an American Express 
bill some 15 years ago? But no. We dutifully mailed the company a token amount 
each month until the balance was paid in full. Sucker!

BOOK REVIEW / NONFICTION; RETHINKING OUR APPETITE FOR DIET OVERKILL; CONSUMED 
BY MICHELLE STACEY ; SIMON & SCHUSTER, $21, 237 PAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAREN STABINER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Michelle Stacey thinks that we've forgotten how to eat -- or rather, how to 
enjoy eating. 
</P>
<P>
 If the 1980s were all about excess, from leveraged buyouts to Brie baked with 
walnuts, the 1990s are the lean decade. Reasonable savings programs and soy 
cheese melted on a plain bagel. 
</P>
<P>
 We've gone overboard again, in what she considers a boring direction: We've 
started to see food not as a sensory experience but as nutritional fuel; it's 
no longer part of the good life, but a sinful temptation that we must deny. 
</P>
<P>
 Her book, "Consumed," is a collection of essays that analyzes how we got to 
this tasteless pass, and how everyone from chefs to food technologists feel 
about it.  
</P>
<P>
 She's particularly interested in the men and women who are trying to give us 
immortality in a muffin, such as Paul and Barbara Stitt, flaxseed apostles who 
run a bakery in Wisconsin, and Norm Singer, who invented the first FDA-approved 
fat substitute. 
</P>
<P>
 Stacey sticks with individuals involved in the fray, either as food futurists 
or as critics of the trend toward regimented eating. She has a wicked, fine eye 
for the ironic detail and a lovely, clean style; no literary cream or butter 
clog up her prose. 
</P>
<P>
 The portraits she draws are crystalline; if only she'd looked around just a 
bit more, to see what, besides a desire for control, influences the way we eat. 
It's not just over- or underweight people who get crazy about food. Even a 
middle-of-the-road eater has trouble getting by in a world full of messages 
about how we all ought to eat better and, more to the point, look different. 
</P>
<P>
 It takes a healthy ego to survive a day's worth of image mongering, 
particularly for women: What have we come to when Brooke Shields, who hardly 
qualifies as Rubenesque, does jazzy TV commercials about how to lose a couple 
of pounds? Why is Cindy Crawford the only mega-model who even vaguely resembles 
a human being instead of a beanpole? 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever sane things we manage to tell ourselves about how to eat, popular 
culture says we haven't measured up. Stacey addresses the issue of eating 
disorders in one of her essays, but she is more interested in the relationship 
between dieting and the individual's illusion of control than in the larger 
social conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
 The control she imposes on her material -- blocking off subjects into essays, 
never letting the philosophical peas slop over onto the potatoes -- keeps the 
flavors clear but precludes a broader understanding of what's at work. Stacey 
reminds us that eating disorders were not invented in the 1980s; still, it 
would be nice if she'd cast her analytical net a bit further out. 
</P>
<P>
 One of Stacey's best essays is "Public Eating: Serving the Food Phobes," in 
which she takes us into professional kitchens to hear what restaurateurs and 
chefs think about the trend toward custom orders (sauce on the side, no-oil 
salad dressings, an imaginative assortment of efforts to purge the demon fat 
from a menu).  
</P>
<P>
 Santa Fe's Mark Miller manages to communicate more succinctly what Julia Child 
has been saying for years: that a teaspoon of lard in a tamale is not as 
threatening as the pool of olive oil a misguided diner dunks his bread in, that 
our campaign for dietary control is based on a lot of misinformation. 
</P>
<P>
 He's right, of course. There is something sad, finally, about diners so 
terrified of a nutritional misstep that they deny themselves the dishes the 
chef has created. (Can you think of another art form where the consumer has the 
audacity to edit the artist?) 
</P>
<P>
 But there's another kind of obsession that gets less ink because it implies 
macho immortality -- the diner who powers through too much food and drink 
simply to prove he can, the embodiment of the great American pioneer spirit.  
</P>
<P>
 It's painful to watch a woman agonize over a lettuce leaf, as though she 
wished she had a squeegee to remove its dressing. It's also painful to watch an 
overweight man (the ghosts of his artery-clogged relatives tsk-tsking at his 
shoulder) barrel through a damn-the-torpedoes dinner because he can't cope with 
reality.  
</P>
<P>
 Stacey focuses on the trend toward food-wrangling, toward bending what we eat 
to do our will -- a hopeless and somewhat comic task, finally, since nobody 
gets out of here alive, regardless of what they eat. Perhaps sanity sits not in 
blithe disregard but in the reasonable middle range.

MOVIE REVIEW; PLAYING COUPLES IN 'THREESOME'; A FILM ABOUT SEXUAL CONFUSION AND 
ROLE-PLAYING SHOULDN'T BE QUITE SO GRINNINGLY CONTENT WITH ITSELF. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER RAINER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The strange thing about "Threesome" is that it looks like a TV sitcom but it 
walks and talks like a soft-porn roundelay. It's as if "Three's Company" 
suddenly got a case of hot monkey love. 
</P>
<P>
 The threesome in question involves Stuart (Stephen Baldwin) and Eddy (Josh 
Charles), college roommates who couldn't be further apart in temperament, and 
Alex (Lara Flynn Boyle), who, through a computer mix-up, ends up sharing a dorm 
suite with them. They hit it off -- sometimes literally -- in that seriously 
rowdy way that filmmakers always imagine college students behave. 
</P>
<P>
 Stuart is a business major but most of his business seems hormonally inspired: 
He's a jock rake with an itch for Alex. (He thinks everything she does is sexy, 
even throwing food at him.) Eddy is a more languid and "sensitive" type, which, 
in movie-ese, means he's sexually confused. Alex's high-powered attempts to 
seduce him are rebuffed because, although he doesn't let his dorm mates know it 
for a while, he's attracted to Stuart. 
</P>
<P>
 Writer-director Andrew Fleming invests a lot of faith in these three: They're 
featured in practically every scene, with occasional drop-ins by other 
students. It's a strategy that only works if the characters are fascinating 
enough to sustain an entire movie and the hi-jinks in "Threesome" don't 
sustain. It becomes "Tiresome." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the likability of the three actors, Stuart, Eddy and Alex never 
achieve fully human status. Fleming zeros in on the sex and the romance but 
keeps out just about everything else that might allow us to connect with them. 
("Carnal Knowledge" had the same problem.) We don't get any sense of what it 
really means for these three to go to college -- as if it would be too "square" 
to actually deal with how they were affected by their studies. It's all on a 
paper-thin "personal" level. That's what's sit-com-ish about it. 
</P>
<P>
 A movie about sexual confusion and role-playing shouldn't be quite so 
grinningly content with itself. There's no particular terror or upset in the 
lives of these three. Alex's rejection, Eddy's wavering, Stuart's rollickings 
are all experienced on the same level as a fatuous coming-of-age scenario. The 
sex scenes -- such as Alex writhing on Eddy's library desk or talking to him on 
the phone while being made love to by Stuart -- seem shoe-horned into the movie 
in order to make it sparkle for the youth market. "Threesome" gives raciness a 
bad name. It's almost enough to bring out the prude in you. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides "Carnal Knowledge," "Threesome" has its other influences and, in one 
of its more shameless scenes, we see one of them. Eddy is shown watching a 
movie -- described only as "an old French film about two men who loved the same 
woman." That Truffaut's "Jules and Jim" should be tossed off in this way is a 
measure of this movie's Liteness. Should we be thankful Eddy wasn't watching 
"Citizen Kane," a classic "about a newspaper big-shot"? Or "Psycho" -- a movie 
"about a guy and a shower"? 
</P>

THEATER REVIEW; FIGHTING A CHEKHOVIAN 'DEMON' AT THE TAPER; A SUPERB BUDDING 
ENSEMBLE PERFORMING IN A NEW ARENA STAGING, BRINGS TO LIFE THE PLAYWRIGHT'S 
LONG, LESS-FOCUSED 'THE WOOD DEMON.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON SHIRLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In 1899, Anton Chekhov wrote to a would-be publisher of his then-10-year-old 
"The Wood Demon": "I despise this play and am trying to forget I ever wrote it. 
. . . It would be a severe blow if anyone tried to revive it." 
</P>
<P>
 Too bad, Chekhov. The Mark Taper Forum has done the deed you so feared. The 
play lives. And in the hands of the Antaeus Company, the Taper's new classical 
ensemble, the play thrives in most of the first three acts, becoming forced 
only in the fourth. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, many of its characters have lived over the intervening century in 
Chekhov's "Uncle Vanya," which borrowed so much from the earlier play that it's 
easy to see "The Wood Demon" as a rough draft. These unhappy Russian gentry 
were even spotted at the Taper -- back in 1969, when Harold Clurman staged 
"Uncle Vanya" there. 
</P>
<P>
 Once again, crotchety Prof. Serebryakov and his young, bored second wife 
Yelena are living on the country estate of the professor's late first wife. The 
deceased's brother (here named Zhorzh instead of Vanya), who also lives there, 
still has an intense and unrequited passion for Yelena. 
</P>
<P>
 The offspring of the professor's first marriage, 20-year-old Sonya, is still 
fascinated by a country doctor and ardent environmentalist (here named 
Khrushchov instead of Astrov but usually called "The Wood Demon"). 
Vanya/Zhorzh's mother still lives with the family, and they still have a 
garrulous neighbor nicknamed Waffles. 
</P>
<P>
 Less focused than "Uncle Vanya," "The Wood Demon" gives four additional 
friends and neighbors plenty of lines, mostly for comic relief. More characters 
mean more roles for members of the 69-actor Antaeus Company, but it also 
translates into a longer sit -- including its two intermissions, this "Wood 
Demon" lasts three hours and 10 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of that time is well spent. The agonies and ecstasies of these people are 
keenly expressed in this spirited new translation by two Antaeus members, 
Nicholas Saunders and Frank Dwyer. Only one quibble comes to mind -- Zhorzh 
insults Professor Serebryakov by calling him a perpetuum mobile . An earlier 
translator used "non-stop writing machine," which might work better for a 
non-Latin-speaking audience. 
</P>
<P>
 The company worked on this project for three years -- about 10 times longer 
than the time spent on most Taper projects. Each role has been cast with at 
least two actors, so the composition of the cast is likely to change at each 
performance. Dwyer's staging never appears wayward or uncertain. The talk is 
punctuated with brief bursts of physical comedy and telling non-verbal details, 
as when Serebryakov keeps eating his lunch while everyone else is paying rapt 
attention to the Wood Demon's save-the-forest speech. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time, the Taper has become an arena stage, with a small section 
of seating on the north side. At first, from a vantage point on the south, this 
added the intended intimacy, which is also encouraged by D Martyn Bookwalter's 
canopy of greenery covering the entire hall. 
</P>
<P>
 But during the last act, from a seat on the new north side, there were 
problems with sight lines -- most notably when the entire cast looks at the 
light from a distant forest fire, with backs turned toward those of us on the 
north. Instead of faces, we saw the lights, busily creating the fire effect for 
the other spectators. Some of the other sight lines might be improved if the 
north seats were simply installed at a sharper rake. 
</P>
<P>
 The ending of the play has other problems, too. "The Wood Demon" is touted as 
lighter than "Uncle Vanya," with a supposedly happy ending. This is misleading. 
One of the "Wood Demon" characters succeeds at suicide. In "Uncle Vanya," the 
same character tries only to shoot someone else -- and twice misses, turning 
the episode into a grim joke. 
</P>
<P>
 Furthermore, two of the three couplings at the end of "The Wood Demon" will 
surely result in less happiness, not more. One of these matches, between two 
minor characters, is especially contrived, and yet Chekhov gave this couple the 
final scene in the play, where it seems especially superfluous. 
</P>
<P>
 This is not to slight the actors, however. The cast at the press preview was 
superb. And it was tantalizing to read, for example, that Nike Doukas, who was 
playing Sonya, also plays Yelena -- in many ways Sonya's opposite. The value of 
maintaining an ongoing classical company at the Taper has never been more 
apparent. 
</P>

 Dueling 'NYPD Blue' Campaigns: Viewers for Quality Television, a 10-year-old 
advocacy group that supports excellence in network programming, is urging 
viewers nationwide to back ABC's "NYPD Blue" by joining a letter-writing 
campaign pledging support to the show's advertisers. The call comes in response 
to the Rev. Donald E. Wildmon's previously announced plans to spend the entire 
$3-million annual media budget of his American Family Assn. to "dissuade" 
advertisers from backing the show, which he targeted as "soft-core pornography" 
even before it premiered. "It's important that viewers . . . sit up and applaud 
advertisers who are taking a risk on a controversial show," said Dorothy 
Swanson, president of the Virginia-based VQT, noting that advertisers usually 
hear only negative responses from viewers. "I would like to stir up those 
complacent viewers that through their silence are allowing the Wildmons of this 
country to have their power." For an "NYPD Blue" sponsor list, viewers can 
write to VQT at P.O. Box 195, Fairfax Station, Va. 22039.

 * Fox Goes 3-D: Fox TV has announced plans for what it calls "two nights of 
interactive fun" with a prime-time event tied in to such promotional items as 
scratch-and-sniff cards and 3-D glasses. Called "Fox-O-Rama" and hosted by 
"Married . . . With Children" star Ed O'Neill, the programming starts May 8 
with the show "Martin," which will air viewer-submitted impersonations of 
oversexed series character Sheneneh. The 3-D glasses, to be used for a 
specially filmed episode of O'Neill's series, plus scratch-and-sniff cards 
matching scents presented on "Living Single," will be contained in promotional 
kits that will be sold for 33 cents at participating 7-Eleven stores beginning 
next Friday. The glasses and cards will also be matched to the May 9 movie 
"Revenge of the Nerds IV: Nerds in Love."

 * NBC to Focus on Jobs: NBC News will focus on "Jobs: America's Most Wanted," 
with related debates, features and news reports on all its news programs April 
24-30. America's Job Bank, a national employment coordinator, will join in the 
effort by publicizing available jobs in various areas of the country. Among the 
programs devoting all or part of their air time to the coverage: "Meet the 
Press," "Today," "NBC News at Sunrise," "NBC Nightly News," "Dateline NBC," 
"Now With Tom Brokaw and Katie Couric," "Saturday Today" and "NBC News 
Nightside."

 * Washington Insight: Author Peggy Noonan, a Washington lawyer and former aide 
to Presidents Reagan and Bush, is heading to public TV with a series set to 
premiere next year at the latest. PBS President Ervin Duggan says Noonan's book

 Self-Censorship Made Easy: A new form of self-censorship is being introduced 
in strict Singapore by the Singapore Repertory Theatre, which is presenting a 
bawdy comic drama there by the British troupe Lu Man Theatre. In an effort not 
to offend audience members, the theater will flash a red light just before a 
nude appears onstage so bashful members of the audience can close their eyes. 
Then a bell will ring when the "flash of flesh" is over, signaling they can 
resume watching. Artistic director Tony Petito said the idea was his own, and 
the government, which only last year allowed the country's first sexually 
explicit musical production ("The New Rocky Horror Show"), was not trying to 
censor the show. "It's very innocent nudity; we're just talking about a couple 
of bare bottoms," said Petito, who said that nonetheless, any public nudity in 
Singapore is still an "issue." POP/ROCK

HOME TECH / VIDEO: WILL 'MRS. DOUBTFIRE' CASSETTES CLEAN UP? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS HUNT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Home video is stepping on the toes of the theatrical market these days. The 
trend seems to be to bring hit movies to video while they're still playing in 
theaters. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It started with "The Fugitive," whose theatrical life was revived by Oscar 
nominations. The action drama could have stayed longer in theaters but instead 
was whisked to video three weeks ago. Now FoxVideo's "Mrs. Doubtfire," which is 
still playing in theaters around the country, is due April 26, at $20. 
</P>
<P>
 And the sleeper hit of the year, Warner's "Ace Ventura: Pet Detective," is 
coming to video on June 14, at $25. With the kind of business it's doing, this 
movie, which has grossed $64 million so far, could still be attracting 
moviegoers this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 What's happening is that studios are weighing the revenues of the last stages 
of a theatrical run against the profit windfall of a home-video release -- and 
home-video is winning. 
</P>
<P>
 Bruce Pfander, FoxVideo's senior vice president of marketing, said the company 
will ship about 8 million copies of "Mrs. Doubtfire," a gross of about 
$100-million. "That's better than it would do in theaters," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of planning a video release is finding a time when the competition isn't 
fierce. " 'Mrs. Doubtfire' will own the market in May," Pfander added. "There 
are no other major sell-through (sales-oriented) releases in May. It should 
also do well in the Mother's Day gift market. 
</P>
<P>
 "Also, we'll get the retail floor space we need to market this properly and we 
won't have to fight for that space, which is very important. If we wait until 
fall, we have 'Jurassic Park' and 'Snow White' to worry about." 
</P>
<P>
 'Ben-Hur' 
</P>
<P>
 Easter is over but that doesn't mean you can't enjoy "Ben-Hur," the granddaddy 
of biblical epics and winner of a record 11 Oscars, including best picture and 
best actor (Charlton Heston in the title role). Though dated, it's still 
entertaining, and the famed chariot race remains one of the most thrilling 
sequences in film history. 
</P>
<P>
 MGM/UA recently released a fancy 35th anniversary package, at $40, featuring a 
"Making of" documentary. But unless you have at least at 27-inch screen, don't 
bother with the letterboxed version of this super wide-screen movie. On a small 
TV, you'll have to squint to see the picture. The edges of the picture are 
chopped off on the regular, cropped version, but it's the best bet for those 
with small screens. 
</P>
<P>
 Special Interest Videos: 
</P>
<P>
 The buzz among fitness-video buffs (there are fanatics who buy every new one 
that comes out) is that Jackie Joyner Kersee's "Beyond the Bounds" is one of 
the best. Her 50-minute aerobic workout tape, priced at $20, is due April 26. . 
. . Want to teach your child how to swim? You might try Jim Booth's "Bubbly 
Baby Swim Video" (New Market Sales, $15), due Wednesday. . . . Fans of NBA's 
outspoken star Charles Barkley will like "Sir Charles" (CBS-Fox, $20), an 
informative, 50-minute documentary that's part biography and includes some 
interesting footage and interviews. 
</P>
<P>
 What's New on Video: 
</P>
<P>
 "The Age of Innocence" (Columbia TriStar). Director Martin Scorsese's 
adaptation of Edith Wharton's novel about passions steaming under the prim 
exterior of upper-class New York in the 1870s. A lawyer (Daniel Day-Lewis) is 
hopelessly smitten by the cousin (Michelle Pfeiffer) of his fiancee (Winona 
Rider). Marvelously subtle and elegantly understated, for those who like 
slow-moving dramas. 
</P>
<P>
 "A Bronx Tale" (HBO). Robert De Niro, who also has a supporting role, is 
impressive in his directorial debut. Set in the 1960s, it's about a New York 
youngster, portrayed at ages 9 and 17, who is torn between his law-abiding 
father (De Niro) and a charming gangster (Chazz Palminteri) -- a tug-of-war 
that grows more intense as he gets older. An absorbing drama with an intriguing 
subplot about the tensions between blacks and Italians in New York. Lillo 
Brancato is excellent as the hero in his teens. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fearless" (Warner). Surviving a plane crash lifts an architect (Jeff Bridges) 
into a strange psychological zone. He drifts away from his wife (Isabella 
Rossellini) and forms a strong tie with a fellow survivor (Rosie Perez). 
Directed by Peter Weir, it's a fascinating, eerie downer of a movie that 
grapples with cerebral issues, boasting exceptional performances by Bridges and 
Perez, who got an Academy Award nomination for her work.  
</P>
<P>
 "The Beverly Hillbillies" (FoxVideo). Director Penelope Spheeris' lame film 
version of the old TV series, about the backwoods Clampett family striking it 
rich and moving to Beverly Hills. The bland, lowbrow remake doesn't recapture 
the high-spirited fun of the original. If you like the old series, you'll gag 
at Jim Varney as Jed -- the role Buddy Ebsen made famous. Lily Tomlin and 
Cloris Leachman costar. 
</P>
<P>
 "A Home of Their Own" (PolyGram). Kathy Bates stars as a gutsy, jobless single 
mother of six who leaves Los Angeles with her family and settles in Idaho. For 
those with a taste for sentimental, somewhat corny, inspirational movies, this 
is quite good, featuring exemplary work by Bates and Edward Furlong as her 
eldest son. 
</P>
<P>
 Upcoming: 
</P>
<P>
 "Malice," "Carlito's Way" and "Cool Runnings" (Wednesday); "Mr. Jones," "Flesh 
and Bone," "Ruby in Paradise," "The Saint of Fort Washington" and "Another 
Stakeout" (April 20); "Mrs. Doubtfire" and "Batman: Mask of the Phantasm" 
(April 26); "Ernest Rides Again" (April 27); "The Remains of the Day" and "A 
Perfect World" (May 4); "Addams Family Values," "The Three Musketeers," 
"Orlando" and "Into the West" (May 11); "The Piano" and "Rudy" (May 25); 
"Wayne's World 2" (June 8).

POP ALBUM CHART; MONKS GAINING ON BONNIE RAITT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Who says being PI--politically incorrect--doesn't pay? Tim McGraw has ridden 
the PI wave all the way to the Top 10. His album, "Not a Moment Too Soon," 
bolted into the Top 10--No. 8--in just two weeks. What's selling it is his 
controversial single, "Indian Outlaw," which is in the pop Top 20. Native 
Americans, naturally, are infuriated by it but, once again, controversy sells 
records. Bonnie Raitt's "Longing in Their Hearts" inched up a notch to the top 
of the chart. How long it stays up there is a function of the success of her 
single, "Love Sneakin' Up on You," which moved up just four places to No. 31. 
If it continues to climb--and help sell albums--"Longing" might hang on to the 
top spot for the next few weeks. Hammer may not be dead yet. His maligned "The 
Funky Headhunter," which had been slipping down the chart, suddenly changed 
directions, jumped from No. 34 to No. 28. R. Kelly's "Bump 'n' Grind" is still 
at the top of the pop singles chart. 
</P>
<P>
 * The year's From-Out-Of-Nowhere award has to go to the Benedictine Monks of 
Santa Domingo de Silos for their album, "Chant," which has risen to No. 13 in 
just three weeks. It's doubtful that any other artist this year will top this 
rocket-like rise to fame. Three weeks ago, hardly anyone in the pop world had 
heard of this group, whose album is released by Angel Records--a classical 
label. Get set for a wave of chanting albums. 05,51,06,08,08,04 Rank Rank 2

RECORD REVIEW; ALUMNI REUNION A MILESTONE; *** HERBIE HANCOCK, WAYNE SHORTER, 
RON CARTER, TONY WILLIAMS, WALLACE RONEY; "MILES DAVIS TRIBUTE" QWEST  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL KOHLHAASE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Was all the effort that went into this recording worth it? Well, yes and no. 
Yes, in that Davis' elite mid-'60s rhythm section comes together surprisingly 
well, though in different fashion than when they cut such landmark discs as 
"E.S.P.," "Miles Smiles" and "Nefertiti." No, in that the cool camaraderie of 
the originals is lost, replaced instead by a glossed over give-and-take that 
succeeds on individual delivery rather than on group presentation. That 
Hancock, Shorter, Carter and Williams still find common ground for their now 
disparate styles makes this tribute something of a triumph. 
</P>
<P>
 The main reason for this success is the tunes themselves. Such lost classics 
as Carter's "R.J." and Shorter's "Pinocchio" demonstrate how much Davis' sound 
of the period owes to his sidemen's compositions. When the group looks further 
back in time, as they do on "So What" and "All Blues," the improvisations seem 
merely exercises, without the weight that the later pieces carry. 
</P>
<P>
 As individuals, Miles' backing foursome has seldom sounded better. Shorter, 
long missing in action since the demise of Weather Report, is agile and gutsy 
on tenor, fleet and pointed on soprano. Carter's bass rings with strong 
melodicism and Eastern-influenced double-stops on "Elegy," while Hancock's 
train-of-thought improvisations carry an almost visual quality. And Williams' 
muscular embellishments and bass-drum onslaught makes even "So What" rock with 
to-the-beat certainty. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the spotlight is on Roney and he delivers Davis' spirit with uncanny 
clarity. While the trumpeter is often criticized for shadowing Miles too 
closely, here it's just what the doctor ordered. In earlier efforts, both 
Wynton Marsalis and Freddie Hubbard failed to capture Davis' essence when the 
same four Davis alumni were billed as the V.S.O.P. band. But Roney is eerily 
suited to the cause, right down to the practiced muffs and miscues that Davis 
turned into an art.BILL KOHLHAASE

MOVIE REVIEW; 'TWO COPS': AN ARRESTING, FRESH KOREAN COMEDY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For years Korean films have been shown theatrically in Los Angeles but most 
often without subtitles or publicity outside the Korean-American community. 
Therefore, "Two Cops" (at the Vista starting Saturday) is something of a first 
in that its L.A.-based distributor, James Kim of Castalia Pictures, now intends 
to bring to Korean pictures the crossover audiences that attract Chinese and 
Japanese movies. 
</P>
<P>
 It's about time, because in film festivals and in non-commercial venues those 
precious few Korean films accessible to non-Koreans have often proved exciting 
and stylish. 
</P>
<P>
 Kim's choice to break ground couldn't be better. Just when you thought that 
there could be no more riffs on the veteran cop/young cop relationship, writer 
Sung-Hong Kim and director Woo-Suk Kang have come up with a film that's 
amazingly fresh, funny and original when it so easily could have been merely 
derivative. Thoroughly entertaining, "Two Cops," which is not in the least 
exotic, is commercial in the very best sense of the word. 
</P>
<P>
 Right at the start, the veteran Detective Cho (Sung-Gi Ahn) of the Seoul 
police department is established as a man who's not going to pass up a free 
meal or more generous gifts from the citizenry if it comes his way. However, 
his new fresh-from-the-academy partner, Detective Kang (Joong-Hoon Park), is so 
shocked at such conduct he starts to write up a report on him. 
</P>
<P>
 With consistent deftness, the film's writer and director keep Kang from doing 
this as the wet-behind-the-ears rookie wises up, and he and his senior partner 
find themselves tracking down a serial killer. At the same time they resist 
buddy movie cliches, with each detective given a life of his own apart from 
each other. 
</P>
<P>
 "Two Cops" is a fine behavioral comedy in the old Hollywood tradition best 
exemplified by Howard Hawks and Leo McCarey. It has fun with Kang's primness 
but respects his integrity while moving on to a more serious point: Those who 
are the most pious also often prove to be the most vulnerable to corruption 
when they've become disillusioned. 
</P>
<P>
 Director Kang runs with a script that most of his Hollywood counterparts would 
envy for its solid construction, its grasp of human nature and and its hearty, 
inspired humor. Both the lean, weathered Ahn and the young, fresh-faced Park 
(who studied acting at NYU) are engaging, highly expressive actors with much 
presence and comic flair. 
</P>
<P>
 Hopefully, Castalia will be able to build upon the handsomely produced "Two 
Cops," which has fine English subtitles, to start bringing to mainstream 
audiences a wide range of quality Korean films on a regular basis. 
</P>
<P>

violence, although not in large doses, to make the film unsuitable for small 
children. 'Two Cops'

JAZZ REVIEW; VERVE ANNIVERSARY BASH A CELEBRATION OF THE PRESENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GENE SEYMOUR, NEWSDAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 No company in the jazz business packages its records as smartly as Verve. So 
it made sense that Wednesday's gala celebration of the label's storied history 
should have come as tightly wrapped and as colorfully arranged as a box of 
assorted sweets. Some of the offerings were gooey. Others were tart. But a few 
more mixed nuts here and there would have been welcome. 
</P>
<P>
 From the jump, it was clear that this made-for-TV event (scheduled for 
broadcast May 18 on PBS, as part of the Great Performance Series) would serve 
just enough of the 30-plus artists assembled for the bash. Despite the 
cavalcade of historic tributes, "Verve at 50" was less a celebration of the 
label's past than a creamy-dreamy salute to its glittering present. 
</P>
<P>
 Within such limitations, there were a few pleasures to be had. It was nice, 
for instance, to see Dee Dee Bridgewater make a rare appearance, and nicer 
still to see her coming into her own as a vocalist. Organist Jimmy Smith glowed 
within the frame of Oliver Nelson's classic arrangement of "Walk on the Wild 
Side," re-enacted with the proper sense of fun by the Carnegie Hall Jazz Band. 
Smith milked the formal-garbed audience so shamelessly that he gave the 
evening's somewhat self-conscious toniness a welcome jolt. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, the design of the show -- tributes to Ella Fitzgerald, Stan Getz, 
Oscar Peterson, Dizzy Gillespie, Bill Evans and other Verve icons -- was 
intelligently crafted. But some of the details were bewildering. Why, for 
instance, was Miles Davis one of the honorees? His only direct connection with 
Verve have been on a couple of sessions with Charlie Parker. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It became clear that Davis' ghost was summoned for no other purpose than to 
bless the fusion artists who opened the second half. Co-host Herbie Hancock, 
now a full-fledged Verve guy, also used his former boss' spirit to advance his 
own forthcoming work for the label, billed as a "synthesis of jazz hip-hop and 
African music." You like to root for someone who knows and loves the music as 
well as Hancock, but the groove-infested piece he trundled out only served to 
constrain such vital young voices as trumpeter Roy Hargrove and saxophonist 
Gary Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, one was hoping that Hargrove, the latest and most promising addition 
to Verve's roster, would have had the chance to shine at this event -- as he 
often has in similar settings. But his high-altitude fluidity seemed checked by 
the program's brisk pace. Indeed, there seemed just enough time for each of the 
stars to make an impression and leave. Trombonist J. J. Johnson and singer 
Betty Carter made the best of the situation. Carter's lively performance of 
"How High the Moon" showed her to be not only the best scat singer of the 
night, but the best bandleader as well.

'HOLOCAUST': KEEPING THE TRUTH ALIVE -- AGAIN; TELEVISION: WELL BEFORE 
'SCHINDLER'S LIST,' A MINISERIES AWAKENED MILLIONS TO THE HORROR OF NAZI 
GENOCIDE. IT RETURNS TO AMERICAN AIRWAVES FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 15 YEARS. 
</P>

 More than 15 years before "Schindler's List," another Hollywood film awakened 
perhaps as many as 400 million TV viewers around the world to the horror of 
Nazi genocide during World War II, changed laws in Germany and helped pave the 
way for Steven Spielberg's acclaimed film. 
</P>
<P>
 "Holocaust," an eight-hour miniseries first broadcast on NBC in the spring of 
1978 and then rerun the following year, was "groundbreaking," according to 
those involved in making it, in that it was the first mass-media dramatization 
about the entirety of the Holocaust -- and certainly the most seen.  
</P>
<P>
 In commemoration of Holocaust Remembrance Week, cable's Family Channel will 
present the mini-series for the first time on American television since 1979, 
Sunday through Thursday at 8 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no question that the impact of 'Holocaust' was unlike anything in 
terms of bringing knowledge and issues of history to a great mass of people," 
said Gerald Green, the novelist who researched and wrote the screenplay, which 
told the story of two fictional German families -- one Jewish, one headed by a 
rising star in the Nazi Party -- and the betrayal, separation, madness and fear 
that befell them. 
</P>
<P>
 "Back then you had Christian neighbors coming out of houses saying, 'Did you 
know this was happening?' Holocaust was just a word to many of these people," 
Green said. "I'm not taking all the credit. There had been many documentaries 
on the Holocaust that were excellent and in many cases got closer to the truth 
than any fictitious drama could. But none were seen by the amount of people who 
saw this show. This reached and made an impression on the average American 
sitting in farmhouses in Duluth, Minn." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Just as "Schindler's List" dominated this year's Oscars, "Holocaust" swept the 
Emmys, winning eight, including outstanding limited series. Meryl Streep, in 
one of her first major roles, won for outstanding lead actress in a limited 
series, Michael Moriarty nabbed the outstanding lead actor Emmy, Blanche Baker 
was honored as outstanding supporting actress, Marvin Chomsky won for his 
directing and Green for his script. 
</P>
<P>
 The most dramatic and perhaps crucial measure of the film's impact is that it 
prompted the German legislature to repeal the statute of limitations on Nazi 
war crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were a bunch of Nazi criminals hiding in South America who were 
planning the very next year to come home to joyful reunions," Chomsky recalled. 
"The show reached 19 million or 20 million households in Germany alone. 
'Schindler's List' probably will be seen by no more than 2 million people 
there. And it prompted countless and interminable conversations and discussions 
and historical analysis, and it got kids in Germany finally asking their 
fathers, 'What did you do in the war?' " 
</P>
<P>
 "I want it on my tombstone that I was partially responsible for changing the 
laws of West Germany and permitting the prosecution of more Nazi war 
criminals," said Green, who also wrote the novel "The Last Angry Man" among 
other books, films and TV shows. "That's not a bad accomplishment." 
</P>
<P>
 James Woods, who starred in "Holocaust" as a Jewish artist married to Streep's 
character, said that when he was in Germany making the film back in 1977, he 
read a poll that indicated that 85% of German 12-year-olds did not even know 
who Adolf Hitler was. "Holocaust," he said, changed that. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've done a lot of true-life stories in my life, but this was the most 
remarkable," Woods said. "It showed that 6 million Jews were murdered, but it 
also didn't forget that another 6 million Gypsies and homosexuals and Catholics 
and communists and political dissidents died in the camps too. Through this 
family, it depicted all aspects of the Holocaust, from Kristalnacht to the 
Warsaw ghetto to the camps to the mass shooting executions at Babi Yar. It 
presented a lot of factual truths that weren't shown in 'Schindler's List.' " 
</P>
<P>
 While remembrance of the Holocaust has already been boosted inordinately by 
Spielberg's film, Chomsky is "quite pleased" that the miniseries will be 
available again in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Spielberg's picture certainly opened some people's eyes, and seeing this may 
open them wider or give them a new perspective or understanding," he said. "We 
teach precious little in the United States about what goes on or what happened 
anywhere else, and just like we teach the Bible stories over and over to each 
new generation, the Holocaust should be recounted repeatedly in the lexicon of 
man's inhumanity to man." 
</P>
<P>
 Green agreed. "Since we told the story to the world, the revisionists -- the 
ones who want to pretend it never happened -- had to come out and work hard to 
spread their lies and slander, and that is still going on," he said. "So I 
don't think you can ever have too many movies or books or articles about this." 
</P>
<P>
 Woods said he has encountered some of these revisionists first-hand. During an 
interview, an American journalist asked Woods where they got the story about 
millions of people being thrown into labor camps and killed. 
</P>
<P>
 "This supposedly was an educated, professional guy, and he thought it was some 
remarkably interesting flight of fancy," Woods said. "You really can't know the 
joy of having participated in such a project that keeps truth alive and maybe 
prods people into understanding or looking more deeply into all human-rights 
abuses that occur, sadly, all the rest of our lives. 
</P>
<P>
 "I mean, this is just 15 short years after millions and millions of people saw 
our miniseries and already they had to be reminded by 'Schindler's List.' In 
just 15 years it was being forgotten, and I dread to say that 15 years from 
now, it might be forgotten again."

MUSIC REVIEW; PIANIST BENEDETTO LUPO: STILL ON BRINK OF GREAT ARTISTRY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CARIAGA, TIMES MUSIC WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Not much has changed in the two years since Benedetto Lupo, bronze-medalist in 
the 1989 Van Cliburn International Competition in Fort Worth, played his first 
Los Angeles-area recital, at Ambassador Auditorium. What is different, 26 
months after that very impressive debut, are our perceptions of the 
now-30-year-old pianist. 
</P>
<P>
 As heard at his second Ambassador recital, Wednesday night, Lupo remains a 
young virtuoso on the brink -- of maturity, of major, world-class achievement, 
of potential widespread acclaim. One must point out, of course, that some 
artists spend entire careers poised on comparable brinks. 
</P>
<P>
 For the nonce, Lupo gives great musical pleasure, demonstrates a faceted and 
admirable control over his many technical resources, and communicates in most 
moments. He sounds like an important young artist. 
</P>
<P>
 His return to Pasadena was met with loud approval by a discerning audience who 
behaved better than most: They clapped only in appropriate places (and then 
vigorously), and coughed seldom. 
</P>
<P>
 The pianist from Bari clearly held their interest. The first half of his 
program -- a real contrast to his 1992 repertory -- consisted entirely of 
Chopin's 24 Preludes, Opus 28, in a serious, often touching performance of 
strong individuality and deep feeling. 
</P>
<P>
 There may be other ways to interpret these Romantic gems, but Lupo's choices 
seemed right for him and usually vivid for his listeners. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the emotions here delivered seemed secondhand rather than spontaneous 
-- the memory of anger, or fear, or tenderness, rather than the feelings 
themselves. Even so, most of these 24 vignettes became viable, and some proved 
memorable. When the pianist got to the final piece, for example, measured 
vehemence at last made an appearance. And the myriad beauties of the more 
moonstruck Preludes -- the "Raindrop," or the F-sharp, or the B-flat -- brought 
out the best in his broad arsenal of touches and dynamics. 
</P>
<P>
 Similar strengths and inconsistencies marked Lupo's playing of Book I in the 
first series of Debussy's "Images," and Book II of Albeniz's "Iberia," proving 
that even practiced virtuosos sometimes let themselves be hurried along and 
even occasionally get into scrambles. It is a genuine tribute to Lupo's usually 
edgeless piano sound that only once in this evening did his tone grow harsh, in 
the knotty convolutions of "Triana," closing item of the program proper. 
</P>
<P>
 After that, the pianist graciously offered three encores: Scriabin's Prelude, 
Opus 11, No. 21; Rachmaninoff's "Moment Musical," Opus 16, No. 4, and Debussy's 
"La plus que lente."

RESTAURANT REVIEW; COZY CLAUDE'S CAN WARM THE HEARTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHELLE HUNEVEN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Claude's is a country French restaurant in Pasadena whose virtues include a 
location well away from Old Town crowds, proximity to the Pasadena Playhouse, 
free nearby parking, not being Italian and a kitchen that can put out fairly 
good food at moderate prices. 
</P>
<P>
 Located in the old Chez Vous space on Green Street, Claude's opened almost 
three months ago. The eastern side of the restaurant is a bistro, white-walled, 
with red-and-white checkered tablecloths and travel photographs on the wall. I 
have never been seated in that room, nor have I seen anyone but the staff 
eating there. 
</P>
<P>
 We are invariably led instead into the main dining room, which has the 
trappings of a classic, cozy and pleasantly anachronistic old-guard French 
restaurant. Windows are dressed in flowery chintz and lace. The ceiling has 
wooden beams. There's a fire blazing in the hearth at dinner time, its flames 
reflected in numerous gradated copper pans hanging from the mantle. Mounted on 
the wall are china plates painted with quail, pheasant and other game birds. 
And everywhereare bushels of dried flowers. 
</P>
<P>
 Claude's clientele is unpretentious, predominantly middle-aged and middle 
class. This is the sort of place where I would feel comfortable bringing my 
parents or the parents of my friends. The price range and menu are just what my 
father, with his Depression-era upbringing, would consider fancy but 
affordable. 
</P>
<P>
 Hostesses are gracious and friendly. Young buspersons are charming and 
helpful. Most of the waiters, however, are distant -- neither unfriendly nor 
personable, but indifferent. Given that this is a French restaurant, such a 
demeanor is somewhat expected. Yet, if it's a stereotypical attitude these 
young men are after, I encourage them to push it: There's nothing like a rude 
French waiter to stir the blood. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday brunch at Claude's is pretty delightful. I am thinking, especially, of 
an endless supply of the Belgian endive salad. And heaps of juicy fresh fruit 
with prosciutto and slices of a wonderful plum tart. The omelet we order is 
overcooked, crispy, disappointing and most of the hot steam table items -- lamb 
curry and chicken wings a l'orange , for instance -- are nothing special. 
Still, we have no trouble overdoing it. 
</P>
<P>
 There's usually a substantial dinner crowd at Claude's, proving that decent 
food at decent prices can bring 'em in. The food at dinner can be spotty, but 
there are some real high points. Red onion soup is weak and watery, but I love 
dunking the little goat cheese toasts in it. The steamed black mussels are 
among the best I've ever had: fresh, plump, delectable. Salads in general are 
pretty and fresh. Salmon carpaccio, sliced not very thin at all, needs a 
dressing more lively than its few drops of oil. 
</P>
<P>
 Several times, the food I receive is not as it is described on the menu. The 
salade lyonnaise , for example, is described as "endive frisee with diced 
prosciutto topped with poached egg . . ." and so on, but what I receive is a 
mound of standard mixed greens, with the quoted toppings. It's a fabulous 
salad, but it would have been more fabulous, not to mention truthful, to have 
made it with frisee . That same evening, I order spinach-and-ricotta ravioli, 
which allegedly comes in a sage-brown butter sauce. Nope. The dull little 
pillows of indeterminate filling are topped, instead, in a few spoonfuls of an 
uninteresting tomato sauce, which the waiter nevertheless insists is sage 
butter. 
</P>
<P>
 We have better luck with the meats. A special of sauteed veal paillards is 
lightly sauced; braised lamb shank has that wondrous dark, caramelized flavor 
of long-cooked meat. But the roasted duck comes in tough triangular chunks 
which, judging from their cold centers, were apparently precooked. 
</P>
<P>
 Lunch plates can be demure. Both Provencal quiche and the leek-and-ricotta 
tart, served on greens with a mustardy vinaigrette are terrific, but the 
individual portions are simply too small, even for modest appetites. 
</P>
<P>
 Crepes suzette are a bit rubbery, but I loved the sauce of warmed marmalade. 
Napoleons are heavy and sodden, fruit tarts are deadened by a lusterless 
Bavarian cream, but the creme brulee is pleasantly light and more custardy than 
most. 
</P>
<P>
 * Claude's, 713 East Green St., Pasadena, (818) 796-9501. Open Tuesday through 
Saturday for lunch and dinner, Sunday for brunch and dinner. Beer and wine. 
American Express, MasterCard, Visa. Dinner for two, food only, $27 to $52.

MUSIC REVIEW; 3 WORLD PREMIERES FROM COMPOSERS ASSN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIMOTHY MANGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles-based Independent Composers Assn. presented an engrossing and 
rewarding (though difficult) program of five contemporary works for small 
ensembles, including three world premieres, at the County Museum of Art, 
Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Steven Stucky, new music adviser to the L.A. Philharmonic, presided over the 
event as unflappable conductor and got things rolling with his own elegant 
"Boston Fancies" from 1985.Alternating fast, lean and linear "ritornellos" (the 
composer's term) and slow, swirling and rhapsodical "fancies," the work is 
cherishable for the graceful frothiness of its instrumental writing as well as 
for its direct, clear thought. 
</P>
<P>
 The world premieres on the program shared the same ensemble configuration, 
used resourcefully, of piano, percussion, woodwind trio, string trio and harp. 
</P>
<P>
 Stephen Cohn's "Noah's Rhythm" built up from quiet dawn through "beehive 
texture" to a rich edifice of leaping lines and long arches, and then turned 
around and went back again, reminiscing on the rebound and all the while 
offering attractive, glowing sonorities. 
</P>
<P>
 In "Pale Fire," Burt Goldstein set up an insistent metronomic figure that kept 
disappearing beneath gushing, tumbling washes of ideas, only to appear again as 
they ebbed. 
</P>
<P>
 Donald R. Davis' "What Is the Silence" unwound in a series of cogent movements 
unified by a returning segment of slow, hammered dissonances, fading, growing, 
viewed from different angles like a revolving sculpture of granite. 
</P>
<P>
 Polish composer Joanna Bruzdowicz's "Trio dei Due Mondi," for piano trio, 
proved thoroughly accessible in its eclecticism as well as delightfully 
episodic and enigmatic. Though one composer was overheard regretting the lack 
of more rehearsals, the ensembles one and all deported themselves honorably, 
enthusiastically and, apparently, capably. TIMOTHY MANGAN

ART REVIEW; RAISING QUESTIONS, LOOKING FOR MEANING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM WILSON, TIMES ART CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The planet seems to grow smaller, dislodging vast continents like great ships 
in shrinking seas. All passengers wonder about the intentions of The Others, 
worry about rough waters and looming collision. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the myriad minds separately focused on the situation are those of two 
Chinese artists, Dan Qing Chen and Xu Bing, expatriates living in New York. 
Their works are on view at the Art Center College of Design in Pasadena in 
exhibitions organized by Williamson Gallery director Stephen Nowlin. 
</P>
<P>
 All but unknown in these precincts, the artists nonetheless make work that 
appears initially familiar. Chen, 37, was successful in his homeland practicing 
the approved style of Socialist Realism. He has adapted that academic manner to 
a form of visual rumination that may put viewers in mind of the Russian 
expatriate team of Komar and Melamid. Bing, 39, tills the field of the large 
conceptual installation that has become a virtual lingua franca among Western 
artists attempting to remain avant-garde in a Neo-barbaric world. 
</P>
<P>
 What sets this work apart is a matter of attitude. Much Western contemporary 
art has adopted an irritating posture of wisecrack Yankee irony that always 
seems poised to disavow the seriousness of its own intentions. 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, the work of Chen and Bing is both solemn and earnest. That may be 
because of Asia's tradition of respect for cultural expression. It is certainly 
linked to the fact that both were traumatized by the Tian An Men Square 
crackdown of 1989. That ghastly event left no one in a flippant mood. 
</P>
<P>
 "Raise the Arms" typifies the triptych and diptych format of Chen's half-dozen 
large paintings. The first panel copies that detail of David's "The Battle of 
the Romans and the Sabines" in which a woman raises her arms heroically to stop 
the fighting. Her gesture echoes in the next panel -- a copy of a 
black-and-white photograph of Western ballerinas dancing -- and again in the 
final scene from the Beijing massacre. It is bound to remind Americans of Kent 
State and the news photo of the grieving girl that became its trademark. 
</P>
<P>
 Chen raises all the old questions about why we disavow violence while taking 
salacious pleasure in it, why we attend the ballet while others die, why sex 
and death so closely resemble each other. Why, why, why? 
</P>
<P>
 Had Chen adopted the present fashion of rendering such scenes with photo 
blowups, one might be inclined -- out of frustration and despair -- to dismiss 
them as just another sophomoric revival of the unanswerable. The fact that they 
are so lovingly and so well painted lends the images the gravity of a plea 
honestly put. 
</P>
<P>
 Bing's piece is called "Cultural Negotiations" and takes up the entire central 
gallery. The scene appears to be a library room in the People's Republic. Ten 
stiff chairs flank a table so immense that most of the 400 thick books it bears 
are out of reach. Lettered on the wall behind in oversize Big Brotherly letters 
is the standard library admonition, "QUIET." 
</P>
<P>
 Here it means, "If you can manage to learn anything at all in this oppressive, 
unwelcoming place, keep your mouth shut about it." 
</P>
<P>
 All this already qualifies the piece as a superior Conceptual one-liner. The 
experience takes on density in an examination of the thick tomes. It turns out 
there are only two. The rest are copies. One is made up of Chinese characters 
the artist invented and woodcarved himself. They hint at meaning but don't 
really say anything. The second text, in English and titled "Post Testament," 
is a random computer mix of the King James Bible and a contemporary American 
novel pursuing themes of sex, money and mayhem. Reading a bit like "Finnegans 
Wake," it takes the idea of deconstruction back to the Tower of Babel. It 
wonders if meaning still means anything. 
</P>
<P>
 There is wisdom in this work.

TV REVIEWS; OLMOS' 'LIVES IN HAZARD' FINALLY AIRS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOWARD ROSENBERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Later is better than never. It's taken ages for NBC to come up with an air 
date for "Lives in Hazard," tonight's documentary about inner-city youth that 
was filmed largely on the same streets of East Los Angeles where executive 
producer and narrator Edward James Olmos grew up. 
</P>
<P>
 Preceded by an upbeat message from President Clinton about ending the plight 
of "desperate children," the raw and searing hour is worth the wait. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lives in Hazard" was shot by producer/directors Susan Todd and Andrew Young 
as Olmos was directing and starring in "American Me," his movie about gang 
brutality in the barrios, and to some extent this is a documentary about the 
making of that film, intersected by seemingly candid interviews with actual 
gang members. Some of them appeared in "American Me," and tonight they discuss 
the macho and familial attractions of both gangs and prison in an environment 
that appears to preclude other possibilities. As one young man explains, 
"Prison was a thing I wanted to go to, (not) college."  
</P>
<P>
 At once poignant and horrifying, "Lives in Hazard" was completed prior to the 
Los Angeles riots of 1992 and addresses the drug dealing and drive-by shootings 
and other violence that continues to sap the life and hope from these Latino 
communities. 
</P>
<P>
 The documentary is at its most tense and powerful when its cameras enter 
Folsom State Prison to show Olmos and his "American Me" company filming 
sequences there, with some of the institution's sweaty, weight-lifting, 
tattoo-marked inmates as extras. And it's at its most heartbreaking when 
reporting, in an otherwise upbeat postscript, that one of the anti-gang 
heroines of the documentary -- a Latina who also had a role in "American Me" -- 
was herself slain by gang members in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Lives in Hazard" airs at 8 tonight on NBC (Channels 4, 36 and 39).

TV REVIEWS; 'RETOOLING AMERICA' HITS HOME TONIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 "Retooling America," an hourlong look at the effects of U.S. defense cuts and 
the efforts to transform the Cold War military economy, should hit home with 
Southland viewers, who live in an area that has lost some 150,000 
defense-related jobs in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 Writer-directors Mark Dworkin and Melissa Young raise all the big questions -- 
How do we prosper in peacetime? What are viable alternatives to war-based 
industries? and so on -- and provide a lively discussion of same. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, the discussion is limited by "Retooling's" built-in 
assumptions: Conversion to "peaceful" industries is a given (there is, of 
course, no need for a strong defense industry today -- just ask the North 
Koreans and the Russian nationalists), as is the idea of a U.S. government 
industrial policy (free market, anyone?). 
</P>
<P>
 The deck is also stacked a bit. The interviewees are largely a selection of 
leftist labor and community activists, academicians and politicians, U.S. Reps. 
Maxine Waters (D-Los Angeles) and Ronald V. Dellums (D-Oakland) to name two. 
Few dissenting voices are heard. Sen. Slade Gorton (R-Wash.) gets to mention 
that not everyone is in favor of government setting industrial policy -- but 
not enough time to explain why. A McDonnell Douglas executive defends his 
company's choice to stick with defense contracting even though it means 
downsizing, but it's intercut with tales of woe in St. Louis, where thousands 
have lost jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 The program includes a segment on Los Angeles.

 GETTING SERIOUS: Actor Garrett Morris, who was recently shot in a robbery 
attempt, said Thursday he will host a May 12 benefit concert to raise money for 
"Kids Against Guns," founded by Rancho Santa Margarita resident Kathy Graves 
and her brother, Kyle Cathey. . . . The group was formed in response to the 
murder of one of their relatives. "It's time we put an end to this violence," 
says Morris, still recovering from his injuries, "and the best way I think we 
can is by educating our kids about the dangers of guns."

 JUST DUCKY: There's a big to-do at the Pond of Anaheim today, but it has 
nothing to do with the Mighty Ducks. Ogden Entertainment will hold announce the 
name of its new professional indoor soccer team. It's going to be . . . the 
Anaheim Splash. You don't get it? Splash, playing at the Pond? Ogden says the 
team will play 14 home games "in friendly waters" starting June 10. Also to be 
unveiled: a Splash team logo and colors.

 PRIORITIES: The Santa Ana Chamber of Commerce has decided to start giving an 
annual community service award. So who should get the first one? Rudy 
Castruita, superintendent of the Santa Ana Unified School District, who has a 
roomful of accolades for his concentration on helping school dropouts. . . . 
Chamber President Mike Metzler, who knows him well, suggests: "If you ask Rudy, 
he'll tell you what's most important to him is: when he walks into a classroom, 
children know him by name."

 ON THE ROAD AGAIN: Costa Mesa millionaire and businessman Milan Panic has 
gotten plenty of mileage from his 1992 stint as prime minister of his native 
Yugoslavia. This week he is in the Czech Republic by invitation of 
playwright-turned-president Vaclav Havel to talk about economic development in 
Eastern Europe. The trip follows by two weeks an announcement that a Panic drug 
subsidiary, SPI Pharmaceuticals Inc. bought Russia's oldest drug company, 
Oktyabr.

 DEMOLITION: First, we learn that the Santa Monica Freeway will reopen next 
week. Now comes word that demolition of the Northridge Meadows apartment 
complex, where 16 people died in the Jan. 17 quake, will begin May 2. Slowly 
but surely, life after the quake is moving on. . . . But the demolition will 
take longer than usual because layers of the building will be needed as 
evidence for suits filed by relatives. 
</P>
<P>
 DOING DONAHUE: The lights glared. The camera rolled. The spotlight was on 
Reseda High, where violence had intruded last year. Thursday, "The Phil Donahue 
Show" taped a segment about a campus group formed after a student was shot to 
death in a hallway. . . . The group tries to persuade students to break the 
code of silence if anyone brings a gun to school (B3).

 CRAVINGS: The pregnant can't have all the fun. We all get hankerings for that 
favorite food, above, whether it's Polish sausage, strawberry rhubarb pie or 
any other delicacy (Valley Life! Page 8). But, unfortunately, we don't always 
know where to get it, and get it fast. . . . No problem. The answer to your 
sudden urges may be at a restaurant near you.

 BODY AND SOUL: Degen Keppler is not your ordinary workout trainer. This is a 
guy who used to do things to hurt his body, like being addicted to heroin. One 
night of partying 18 years ago cost him his right leg in an accident with a 
.44-caliber Magnum. . . . Well, that's all in the past. These days, the 
drug-free Keppler works 12-hour days at a club in Agoura Hills. See Valley 
Life! Page 29.

<P>
 THE ANSWER IS: Thanks to the Los Angeles Police Department, some Valley kids 
run with the law instead of from it. The program, called Jeopardy, keeps kids 
with a high risk of gang involvement out of trouble by turning them into 
runners (C8). "This program has changed my life and it has really changed me," 
one youth said. . . . At last month's L. A. Marathon, 38 of 39 Jeopardy runners 
finished the 26.2-mile course. Michael Arkush

 ATTENTION CLASS: Some college instructors put their students to sleep. Lynn 
Meschan puts her students into a trance (B1). . . . Once a semester, the 
popular Moorpark College psychology instructor hypnotizes her students, then 
gives them suggestions on positive study habits and effective test-taking. . . 
. But the 18-year tradition may soon end as college trustees weigh their 
lawyer's opinion that each hypnotic trance could trigger a lawsuit.

 POWER JOBS: To the relief of 200 workers in the hills above Simi Valley, 
federal officials have decided to keep the Energy Technology Engineering Center 
open through next year (B5). . . . The center will focus on a promising new way 
to generate electricity called the "Kalina Cycle." Devised by a former Soviet 
scientist, it is 20% more efficient than any other technology. "This is a 
really significant event," manager Robert LeChevalier said. "It's the first new 
thermodynamic cycle that's been invented since 1895."

 LOOSE STRINGS: Simi Valley's chamber orchestra may soon play again (B4). . . . 
Philippe Fanjeaud, a French-born conductor now living in Simi Valley, has 
assembled local musicians to resurrect a chamber orchestra last run by Ingrid 
Ely. If it comes together, the group may be able to play in Thousand Oaks, too. 
"They'd be welcome," said Everett Ascher, who as Conejo Symphony Orchestra 
director has demanded preferential performance dates at the Civic Arts Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
 POWER POLITICS: Supervisorial candidates Madge L. Schaefer and Trudi Loh were 
recently asked to fill out questionnaires if they wanted the backing of the 
Conejo Valley chapter of the National Women's Political Caucus. Loh, who is the 
chapter's president, was the only one to return the questionnaire, which asked 
candidates to reveal their campaign strategies. For fairness, Loh would not 
have been allowed to see the answers of a competing candidate, endorsement 
chairwoman Julia Osborn said. But Schaefer was skeptical: "I didn't just fall 
off the turnip truck."

INCITEMENT CHARGE AGAINST FORMER SS OFFICER DROPPED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Prosecutors on Thursday dropped a criminal investigation of Franz Schoenhuber, 
a former Waffen-SS officer and radical-right leader who had publicly blamed 
Jewish leaders for a rise in anti-Semitism in Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 The public prosecutor's office in Landshut, in the southern state of Bavaria, 
said Schoenhuber's verbal attack on leaders of the Central Council of Jews, 
Ignatz Bubis and Michel Friedman, was directed at two public figures and could 
not be interpreted as a general incitement to race hatred -- a crime in 
Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 Friedman called the decision "either cynical or naive" and said it benefited 
rightist extremists. 
</P>
<P>
 The announcement came on the heels of a decision by the English Football Assn. 
on Wednesday to cancel a soccer match with Germany in Berlin's Olympic Stadium 
on April 20 -- the 105th anniversary of Adolf Hitler's birthday. 
</P>
<P>
 The English group said the game would have been "a focus for disorder" and an 
"unnecessary flash point" for violence from Nazis, anti-Nazis and soccer 
hooligans. British officials said common sense had prevailed. 
</P>
<P>
 But German newspapers Thursday condemned the move as a victory for rightist 
extremists. 
</P>
<P>
 "Disgrace! Why did you crumble before the Nazis?" asked the Bild tabloid, 
Germany's largest daily. "A Goal for Adolf," the Berliner Zeitung said in the 
headline to its main editorial. "Right-wing extremists have shown how to win a 
game without even playing." 
</P>
<P>
 The government believes rightists were responsible for the March 25 
firebombing of a synagogue in Luebeck, northern Germany, one of the worst 
attacks on a synagogue since the Third Reich. 
</P>
<P>
 After the fire, Bubis criticized rightists for inciting anti-Semitism and 
creating a climate for such attacks. He called Schoenhuber, leader of the 
radical-right Republikaner party, "a mental arsonist." 
</P>
<P>
 Schoenhuber, the most serious leader for right-wing extremism in Germany since 
the Third Reich, responded that Bubis was "one of those most responsible for 
provoking anti-Semitism" and called him "the worst inciter of hatred in the 
country." He tried to file his own race-hate lawsuit against Bubis and later 
included Friedman in his accusations. 
</P>
<P>
 Politicians and community leaders expressed outrage at Schoenhuber's taboo 
comments and called for legal action against the 71-year-old party chief, whose 
memoirs, "I Took Part," describe his life as a Waffen-SS sergeant and member of 
Hitler's personal guard. Prosecutors launched a criminal investigation in 
Landshut, near where Schoenhuber had made the comments. 
</P>
<P>
 But the public prosecutor's statement Thursday said that, while Schoenhuber's 
comments were an insult, they were "against Mr. Bubis and Mr. Friedman alone" 
and "cannot be regarded as a statement about Jews living in Germany." 
Therefore, the prosecutors said, it does not amount to inciting racial hatred.

CLINTON PUSHES MANDATES IN HEALTH REFORM MESSAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton took his health reform campaign to America's heartland 
Thursday, telling small-business owners that requiring employers to pay most of 
workers' insurance is the best way to provide coverage for all. 
</P>
<P>
 He acknowledged that the so-called employer mandate is the most difficult 
issue to resolve if he hopes to win congressional passage of the reform plan 
that would require employers pay 80% of their workers' insurance costs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe you have to require everyone to be covered in order to stop the 
boat from leaking," Clinton said in a round-table discussion with six local 
business owners. 
</P>
<P>
 "That is something we have to work through," Clinton said. "It is also 
important that you understand that I will not sign a bill that does not have 
discounts for very small businesses." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton is hoping to build small business support for his health reform plan. 
He argued that his proposal would help lower costs to those small businesses 
that now offer health insurance to their employees often at a price that is 
about 35% higher than large businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal would raise costs, though, to those businesses that do not now 
offer insurance to their employees and the National Federation of Independent 
Businesses is strongly opposed to the employer mandate. 
</P>
<P>
 The employer mandate has proved to be the biggest hurdle for Clinton and the 
main reason why previous efforts at health reform have failed. Many 
Republicans, including Senate Republican leader Bob Dole of Kansas, have said 
they oppose an employer mandate. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton, who vowed during his presidential campaign to end gridlock in 
Washington, expressed a willingness to be flexible on the issue and urged 
lawmakers to tone down the rhetoric and work through their differences. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to do it in a way that permits small business to flourish, because 
small business is the main generator of new jobs for the American economy," 
Clinton told the panel. 
</P>
<P>
 The discussion Clinton held with the six business owners, who described their 
own frustrations with trying to provide health insurance and expressed concerns 
about the proposed health reform plan, was held before an audience of about 150 
representatives from the Kansas small-business community. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Clinton's first stop in a two-day, campaign-style swing through the 
Midwest aimed at winning support for his complex health reform plan that will 
require employers to pay most of the cost of their workers' health insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier Clinton told an airport rally that in any given week, about 58 million 
Americans are without insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of those uninsured are workers who lose coverage temporarily between 
jobs. Most Americans are insured through their employers and the majority of 
the uninsured are employed. 
</P>
<P>
 The Midwest swing was part of an effort to heighten public awareness and 
understanding of the reform plan before lawmakers return next week to work on 
legislation. Clinton said it was important for lawmakers to stop arguing and 
resolve their differences. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we cool the rhetoric and talk about the facts and have practical and 
compassionate approaches to this, we will solve this problem," Clinton told 
supporters.

MCDOUGAL OFFERS TO SELL COPIES OF WHITEWATER PAPERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 President and Hillary Rodham Clinton's former business partner has a new idea 
for making money -- selling Whitewater documents he just got from the White 
House. Price tag: $2 a page. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clintons this week sent James B. McDougal about 2,000 pages of corporate 
tax returns, bank records on the controversial land development and records on 
the sale of Whitewater lots, says a letter from the Clintons' lawyer, David 
Kendall. 
</P>
<P>
 McDougal's lawyer, Sam Heuer of Little Rock, said Thursday that anyone who 
wants copies of the documents can buy the package next Tuesday for $2 a page. 
</P>
<P>
 Heuer said McDougal needs the money for his legal defense. Much of the money 
would go to pay Heuer, who says he has represented McDougal since last fall 
without pay. 
</P>
<P>
 McDougal, when asked about the price tag, took a slap at news organizations 
that have been covering the Whitewater controversy: "These capitalists in the 
East have made money off of us. I think it's only fair we turn it around." 
</P>
<P>
 At the White House, Press Secretary Dee Dee Myers said of the records: 
"They're his. He can do anything he chooses." 
</P>
<P>
 The Clintons were 50-50 investors with McDougal and his then-wife, Susan, in 
the Whitewater project, a 230-acre vacation and retirement development in the 
Ozarks of northern Arkansas.

SIR ROBERT COCKBURN; SCIENTIST THWARTED NAZI RADAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sir Robert Cockburn, 85, British scientist who thwarted German radar during 
World War II, saving countless American and British planes and 
civilians.Educated at London University, Cockburn went into communications 
research for the Royal Aircraft Establishment at the outset of the war. He 
headed a group of scientists and engineers who devised a way to jam German 
navigational radio beams by releasing thin metallic foil strips into the air. 
The strips created a radar echo, making it impossible for German pilots to find 
their targets. After the war, Cockburn spent his career in government military 
research, primarily in atomic energy and guided missiles. Among his awards was 
the U.S. Congressional Medal for Merit. On March 21 in Aldershot, England.

leukemia, his son, Michael, of San Jose, said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The genial French spent about three decades with the Beverly Hills Unified 
School District, about half of it as math teacher, tennis coach and dean of 
boys at Beverly Hills High School and the remainder as principal of Beverly 
Vista Elementary School. He also served as president of the southern section of 
the California Teachers Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't know what the day holds until you begin it and then you have the 
challenge of meeting crises and being able to accommodate parents who want you 
to both educate and take care of their children," he told The Times when he 
retired in 1972. "What I call myself is an accommodator, not an educator." 
</P>
<P>
 French, who once ran for the Los Angeles City Council, helped influence the 
development of Century City and the surrounding area as president of the Tract 
7260 Homeowners Assn. He also used the position to work for community oil 
leases and against a proposed Beverly Hills Freeway along Santa Monica 
Boulevard that was never built. 
</P>
<P>
 He remained on the Airport Commission advisory board until his death. French 
earned a commendation from the Los Angeles City Council for his civic work, and 
a small Westside park is named in his honor. 
</P>
<P>
 A licensed pilot, French taught flying after his retirement and was president 
of the National Cessna 210 Owners Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 He was also a longtime officer of the Will Rogers Optimist Club on the 
Westside. 
</P>
<P>
 Born in Landsdowne, Ontario, Canada, French moved to Monterey, Calif., as a 
child and earned a bachelor's degree in economics from UC Berkeley. During his 
student days, he won the 1932 California State Tennis Championship. He later 
received his master's and doctoral degrees in education from UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 During World War II, French served as an Army officer at Guadalcanal and New 
Guinea, and at the end of the war helped administer the Republic of Korea. He 
was released from active duty in 1946 with the rank of major and retired from 
the Army Reserve in 1965 as a colonel. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to his son, French is survived by his wife of 59 years, Laila, and 
two grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
 The family has asked that any memorial donations be made to the Heart Fund of 
St. Vincent's Hospital, 2131 West 3rd St., Los Angeles, Calif. 90057.

FEDERAL EXPRESS JET LANDS SAFELY AFTER WORKER ATTACKS CREW 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A Federal Express employee armed with a hammer and a spear gun attacked the 
flight crew of a company cargo plane Thursday before the crew wrestled him to 
the floor and safely landed the plane. 
</P>
<P>
 Three people aboard the DC-10, including the attacker, were critically hurt, 
and a fourth suffered less serious injuries, said Rick Roberts of the Regional 
Medical Center in Memphis. 
</P>
<P>
 Airport Authority President Larry Cox said the crew members suffered head and 
body injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were very bloody," Cox said. "It looked like they had been in an 
explosion or a film you would see of Vietnam. . . . It must have been 
hand-to-hand combat." 
</P>
<P>
 The attacker was a company pilot but not a member of the plane's crew, said 
officials of Federal Express, which allows its employees to ride free if room 
is available. 
</P>
<P>
 An FBI agent said the assailant would be held on federal charges of attacking 
an aircraft crew. His motive was unclear. The plane was bound for San Jose, 
Calif.

RELEASE OF SILICONE STUDY DELAYED FOR YEARS; HEALTH: INDEPENDENT EXPERT SAYS 
1975 MICE TEST INDICATES SUBSTANCE IN BREAST IMPLANTS IS VERY TOXIC. DOW 
CORNING DENIES PRODUCT HURT ANYONE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dow Corning Corp. waited almost two decades to disclose an internal study on 
mice that raised questions about the safety of its silicone breast implants in 
the mid-1970s. 
</P>
<P>
 But implant opponents and the company disagreed Thursday on whether the delay, 
or the research, even mattered. 
</P>
<P>
 The debate came as lawyers moved forward with a multibillion-dollar settlement 
to resolve thousands of claims from women who blame implants for a variety of 
illnesses, including immune system disorders. 
</P>
<P>
 Dow Corning is among the companies that have signed the agreement, promising 
to pay women $2 billion over the next 30 years. Dow Corning denies implants 
hurt anyone. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest dispute centers around a 1975 study involving mice and D4, a 
purified form of silicone that is found in small amounts in implants. 
</P>
<P>
 Company spokeswoman Barbara Carmichael said the study found that D4 did not 
harm the immune systems of mice. Only when combined with a substance not found 
in implants did it have a temporary, minor effect on the animals, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But an independent expert on silicone gel said the study showed that high 
levels of D4 were very toxic. In some cases, they killed the mice, said Dr. 
John Naim of Rochester (N.Y.) General Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 In the study summary, Dow Corning scientists wrote that D4 decreased the 
disease-fighting ability of immune cells in mice. 
</P>
<P>
 Naim warned that the study does not necessarily translate to silicone gel 
implants, which contain lower levels of D4. 
</P>
<P>
 "Is it relevant? I don't know," he said. "Is it at a low enough level? That's 
certainly a legitimate defense." 
</P>
<P>
 The corporation, once the largest maker of silicone implants, told the U.S. 
Food and Drug Administration about the study last year, in one paragraph of a 
letter discussing a 1993 study that found a possible link between implants and 
immune system irregularities. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not an effort to somehow hide stuff. We are interested in the public 
health and we are interested in discussing the science" behind implants, 
Carmichael said. 
</P>
<P>
 The FDA did not ask to see the 1975 study because Dow Corning's 
characterization made "it not appear startling or significant," spokesman Jim 
O'Hara said. 
</P>
<P>
 But implant opponent Dr. Sidney Wolfe of the Washington-based Public Citizen 
Health Research Group said the study uncovered alarming effects of D4 that are 
apparent in his reading of the company's letter to FDA. 
</P>
<P>
 "FDA never asked Dow for the study, which is unconscionable," said Wolfe, who 
lobbied the agency to ban implants. "This study really shows some things that 
haven't been shown in previous studies. It is an important study." 
</P>
<P>
 Carmichael said Dow Corning was not obligated to turn over the research 
because it was part of an effort to see if silicone could be used as a medicine 
and was unrelated to implants. The 1975 study was a follow-up to research done 
in 1974. 
</P>
<P>
 The FDA could not immediately say whether the study was legally required, 
because the Medical Devices Act governing such research was not passed until 
1976. But O'Hara said the company should have disclosed the study in 1991, when 
the FDA held hearings on D4 and other components of implants. 
</P>
<P>
 Had the company released the study in 1975, Naim said, scientists might have 
launched objective research into the subject much earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1975 study came to light as lawyers for women prepared to go to court 
against Dow Corning in the first federal trial involving breast implants. 
</P>
<P>
 The case had been set to begin this week in Birmingham, where U.S. District 
Judge Sam Pointer is presiding in more than 7,000 lawsuits combined into one. 
The trial was delayed after Dow Corning and two other companies signed a 
$3.7-billion settlement agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 Negotiations between the women's lawyers and companies, including 3M and many 
other smaller companies, continue this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanley Chesley, a lawyer negotiating on behalf of the women, said lawyers on 
his side have known about the 1975 study for months. 
</P>
<P>
 Such documents, which companies were forced to release as evidence, are the 
main reason corporations such as Dow Corning agreed to the settlement, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are documents against these manufacturers that are much worse," Chesley 
said. "This is just the tip of the iceberg." 
</P>
<P>
 Dow Corning contends that up to 1 million women have received implants, but 
the women's lawyers say the number is closer to 650,000.

U.S. JUDGE REJECTS WARRANTLESS POLICE GUN SEARCHES IN CHICAGO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Police cannot conduct warrantless gun searches in public housing projects, a 
federal judge said Thursday. The decision rebuffed pleas from housing officials 
and tenants who hoped that the sweeps would quell gang violence. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. District Judge Wayne Anderson's ruling ended the latest round in an 
emotional dispute between city officials and civil libertarians, who argue that 
the courts cannot grant a wholesale waiver of the Constitution's protection 
against unreasonable searches. 
</P>
<P>
 Violence last summer prompted the Chicago Housing Authority to ask police to 
conduct the random, door-to-door searches for guns, without obtaining search 
warrants. 
</P>
<P>
 Some tenants also backed the warrantless searches, saying they would prefer 
the sweeps to random gunfire that made it dangerous to stand near windows or 
venture outside. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mothers put kids in their bathtubs in fear of their lives," CHA Chairman 
Vincent Lane said before the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 Lane left the courtroom without comment after Anderson's ruling, which upheld 
a ban imposed last month on the searches. 
</P>
<P>
 The American Civil Liberties Union sued to halt the searches on behalf of 
Chicago's estimated 150,000 public housing tenants. 
</P>
<P>
 Gang warfare last month in the huge Robert Taylor Homes project brought new 
urgency to the debate. Police received more than 300 reports of gunfire in the 
28-building, 12,320-tenant complex over a five-day period. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson has permitted police to conduct warrantless searches if specific 
apartments are pinpointed as sources of gunfire. 
</P>
<P>
 ACLU attorney Harvey Grossman said Anderson's ruling "proves that there is one 
Constitution." He argued that because public housing tenants are poor, 
authorities want to take unconstitutional shortcuts to deal with violence in 
the projects. 
</P>
<P>
 "You would not see weapons searches of apartments on Lake Shore Drive," one of 
Chicago's most affluent areas, Grossman said. "The problem here is the 
inability to provide everyday law enforcement." 
</P>
<P>
 Under terms of their leases, any public housing tenants caught with guns, 
registered or unregistered, face eviction.

CATS LINKED TO HUMAN PLAGUE IN SOUTHWEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Cats that roam newly suburbanized areas in the Southwest are a growing source 
of human plague, federal health officials warned Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Before 1977, domestic cats were not known to transmit human plague, the 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported.But since then, they have 
been identified as carriers in at least 15 cases. 
</P>
<P>
 About half of infected cats die but the disease is rarely fatal in people. 
</P>
<P>
 Cats can pick up the disease from infected fleas or rodents and pass it on 
when they bite, scratch or lick humans. If an infected cat has mouth lesions, 
even its breath can transmit the plague bacteria. 
</P>
<P>
 Dogs also may be infected by dead rodents or fleas but they usually don't fall 
ill and transmit the disease to their owners. 
</P>
<P>
 Kenneth Gage, acting director of the CDC's plague section, recommended that 
residents of newly suburbanized areas of the Southwest keep the area around 
their houses clear of trash that could harbor rodents, treat pets with flea 
powder and keep them from roaming freely.

 Hoax of Fame: A year ago this month, while a jury was deliberating in the 
federal Rodney G. King trial, a city gardener at one L.A. park announced over 
the PA system: 
</P>
<P>
 "The riot has started! Run for your life! They are turning over cars and 
setting fires! They are coming your way!" 
</P>
<P>
 The statement was repeated at least two more times, city officials said. Some 
park-goers -- obviously fearing a replay of the 1992 riots -- were observed 
running to their cars. 
</P>
<P>
 The gardener later claimed that some teen-agers, not him, had made the 
announcement. But his suspension was eventually upheld by the city's Civil 
Service Commission. 
</P>

 Feel free to panic: That incident reminds us of a fake recorded message that 
was once left on the red emergency phones in transit department offices. When 
the 5.8-magnitude Sierra Madre quake struck on a Friday morning in June, 1991, 
employees picked up the phones for instructions and heard this disturbing 
advisory: 
</P>
<P>
 "We are all doomed. Drop your pants and kiss your ass goodby."

 Chouchou! Heel!Here's one French tourist who'll leave with happy memories of 
L.A. -- though she had her anxious moments for a while. 
</P>
<P>
 Fabian Leone had planned to fly home two weeks ago until her poodle, Chouchou, 
crawled under a gate of their Sunset Boulevard motel and went sightseeing 
alone. 
</P>
<P>
 Leone, an actress, vowed to stay in L.A. until she found the gray pooch. 
Finally, on Thursday, a nurse brought Chouchou into a nearby pet hospital that 
Leone had contacted. 
</P>
<P>
 "She (the nurse) found Chouchou in an intersection near here," Leone said. 
</P>
<P>
 We admire Chouchou for ignoring all those nabobs of negativism who say that 
L.A. is a dangerous place to roam about.

 Ski it or not: Only one candidate in the Long Beach mayoral race has attracted 
the attention of the Guinness Book of World Records as well as Ripley's Believe 
It or Not. 
</P>
<P>
 It's political gadfly (and Only in L.A. regular) Ski Demski, who owns the 
largest American flag ever displayed, 505 by 225 feet, according to Guinness. 
In his front yard, patriotic Ski flies a more modest 60-by-30-footer, which the 
city attempted unsuccessfully to prove was illegal.  
</P>
<P>
 Ripley's recently taped a session with Ski -- but won't air it until after 
Tuesday's election so Demski's rivals won't have to be afforded equal time. 
Demski was interviewed alongside his official campaign vehicle, an 
out-of-service fire engine, which has caused some confusion in the past. 
</P>
<P>
 Once, Demski related, "a trash truck caught on fire. And the driver saw the 
fire engine and ran over to my house. I gave him a garden hose and called the 
Fire Department." 
</P>
<P>
 And Demski's reward? 
</P>
<P>
 "Before they put out the fire they had the trash truck dump the trash in front 
of my house," Demski said.

 In honor of International Guitar Month, Fender Musical Instruments notes,

music seance was held in Hollywood several months ago, he failed to 
materialize. Some musicians can be so unreliable.

CAR-POOL LANES ON FREEWAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Regarding the proposal to establish permanent car-pool lanes on the Santa 
Monica Freeway, I would gladly support this if the following provisions were 
added: 
</P>
<P>
 Eliminate the 24-hour-day restriction for use of car-pool lanes and limit the 
time to regular commuter hours: the same as the extra commuter lane times on 
surface streets. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the earthquake, the focus on the collapsed Santa Monica Freeway has been 
on commuters, not the people who live in neighborhoods abutting the freeway. 
Everything has been geared to getting commuters through our neighborhoods, and 
nothing has been geared to ensuring access by local residents. 
</P>
<P>
 We are the "hidden victims" of the earthquake: denied access to our homes, 
businesses and local freeways even during non-commuter hours. 
</P>
<P>
 If car-pool lanes are to be restricted 24 hours a day, I absolutely oppose 
them. If they are restricted to regular commuter hours, and are open for use by 
everyone at all other times, then I support them. 
</P>
<P>
 NANCY J. RIGG 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles 
</P>
<P>
 * If Los Angeles drivers wanted to car-pool, they would, without the need for 
government-mandated inducements, but they clearly do not. The government has no 
business spending public money building car-pool lanes to induce people to do 
something they'd rather not do.  
</P>
<P>
 The ridiculously large fines for solo drivers who dare to use these lanes only 
confirm the government's intentions. These fines are not as high as they are 
because violating the car-pool law is a safety hazard, they are this high to 
ensure the people's compliance with the government's wishes. 
</P>
<P>
 The car-pool promoters at Caltrans recently succeeded in spending a fortune on 
a virtually unused car-pool interchange between the 110 and 105 freeways. I 
drive past it every day and it's rare that I see any cars on it. The money 
wasted on this should have been spent accelerating the freeway bridge 
reinforcement program instead. Then there might not have been any freeway 
collapses in the January earthquake, and the huge additional sums of money 
being spent now to rebuild them would not be necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 In short, all car-pool lanes must go! They are nothing more than an attempt by 
the government to coerce people into doing its will!

POLITICAL BRIEFING: LINKMEYER LOOKS BEYOND CHALLENGING ROBERTI IN RECALL 
ELECTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 PLANNING AHEAD: Randy Linkmeyer, the Canoga Park gun store owner running in 
the recall election against state Sen. David Roberti(D-Van Nuys), is cobbling 
together some political themes that he hopes will be useful beyond Tuesday's 
balloting. 
</P>
<P>
 The themes: Valley representation and campaign finance reform. But more about 
that later. 
</P>
<P>
 Often lost in the cascade of news about the recall and guns is that there is 
life after the election. Political life. Indeed, on June 7, 20th District 
voters will be asked to gird themselves and go to the polls yet again to pick 
their party's nominee to run in November. 
</P>
<P>
 Linkmeyer, 37, of Sherman Oaks is one of half a dozen candidates seeking the 
GOP nomination in June. Van Nuys realtor Dolores White, 59, a veteran GOP 
activist, is another, as is businessman David Honda. Unlike Linkmeyer and 
White, Honda is not running in the recall. Honda was the third-place finisher 
in the 1992 20th District special election but later alienated some by 
endorsing Roberti in the runoff that year. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, the Democratic nominee this year is likely to be state Sen. 
Herschel Rosenthal. Rosenthal has spent the past two decades representing the 
West Side and Hollywood; running for the 20th District will be his first big 
Valley political venture. The 75-year-old senator, who owns a home in West Los 
Angeles, also has rented a Studio City apartment to establish his residency in 
the 20th District. 
</P>
<P>
 Sound familiar? Roberti, it will be remembered, had represented Hollywood for 
most of his political life until he decided in 1992 that it was opportune -- 
due to reapportionment and the imprisonment of ex-Sen. Alan Robbins -- to take 
his political gig to the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Now comes Linkmeyer, attacking Roberti this week for being the candidate 
financed by non-Valley campaign contributors. In fact, the campaign finance 
report for Roberti's Beat the Recall campaign committee is heavily loaded with 
"outside money." Linkmeyer also proposed reforms to make it illegal for 
candidates to get more than 50% of their campaign money from sources outside 
the district in which they are running. 
</P>
<P>
 His pro-Valley theme and his reform proposal, as Linkmeyer acknowledged 
Wednesday, are likely to do double duty for him. 
</P>
<P>
 First they can be used against Roberti. But, more importantly perhaps, they 
give Linkmeyer tools in the 20th District's extended 1994 political season to 
hammer Rosenthal, who is also likely to bankroll his campaign with imported 
bucks and be vulnerable to Valley flag-wavers.

 LIGHTS, CAMERA, BUT HOLD THE ACTION: Looking for a dramatic backdrop for a 
campaign infomercial on crime fighting, state Sen. Tom Hayden was drawn this 
week to the towering stone walls of the legendary Folsom Prison. 
</P>
<P>
 So too was a representative from the state Department of Corrections, who 
tried to shoo Hayden and his entourage away. 
</P>
<P>
 It seems the senator failed to obtain the proper permits for commercial 
filming. Corrections officials require a written letter requesting access, 
which they then forward to the California Film Commission for a filming permit. 
</P>
<P>
 Duane Peterson, Hayden's gubernatorial campaign spokesman, insists he received 
a verbal OK from Folsom Prison officials last week. 
</P>
<P>
 But on Monday when the Santa Monica Democrat arrived with his film crew, 
Peterson said: "We were surrounded by armed guards who told us that the 
political authorities in the Department of Corrections had disallowed access." 
</P>
<P>
 Department of Corrections assistant communications director Tipton C. Kindel 
tells a different story. 
</P>
<P>
 "There wasn't anybody armed," Kindel said. "There was a representative who 
went out and explained they had not followed the necessary procedures to film 
on state property." 
</P>
<P>
 Hayden was making one of several stops in Los Angeles, Sacramento and the Bay 
Area to film infomercial segments that his campaign hopes to air on network and 
cable TV before the June primary. 
</P>
<P>
 The aim, Peterson says, is to "describe how corruption affects people in their 
everyday lives, to explain why political reform is not some egghead, abstract 
concept." 
</P>
<P>
 Ever the rebels, Hayden and his crew stalled around after being asked to 
leave, unloading and reloading their car and spreading out maps as if in 
earnest search of Plan B. Finally the guard(s) ran out of patience and left. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'No can do,' is what they said about our filming," Peterson said. "And we 
did it anyway. We were in a public parking lot." 
</P>
<P>
 Says Kindel, "We hold anybody who wants to film on state property to the same 
standards. If they chose to ignore that, I'm not sure there is anything we can 
do about it." 
</P>

 BARE BONES: In an effort to grease the path for parents seeking to split up 
the mammoth Los Angeles Unified School District, Assemblywoman Paula Boland 
(R-Granada Hills) is stripping a bill to the bare bones. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, in Sacramento, survival often depends on one's willingness to 
compromise. 
</P>
<P>
 Boland's bill would have reduced the number of signatures needed to put the 
question of a school district breakup on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 Now it won't reduce the number of those signatures at all, but will keep them 
at the current mandated level -- 25% of registered voters in a school district. 
</P>
<P>
 What's left is the part of the bill that removes a school board's veto power 
over a voter-approved plan to reorganize its school district. 
</P>
<P>
 After Boland agreed to take out language to lower the signature threshold, 
Assembly Education Committee members who had just voted down the bill Wednesday 
agreed to give it another look. It is tentatively scheduled to come up again 
April 20. 
</P>
<P>
 Prior to the vote, Boland made an emotional plea to committee members to pass 
her bill: "I ask for an aye vote for the people . . . they sent me here. They 
ask me daily to come and bring this bill. I don't go into my district one 
minute of one day that the people don't ask me, 'When are we going to be able 
to get our kids educated properly?' " 
</P>
<P>
 But Assemblywoman Juanita McDonald (D-Carson) quickly accused her colleague of 
overstating the matter: "Ms. Boland, you know all of the people are not telling 
you that. You know that. Some of the people are telling you." 
</P>

 A QUESTION OF FAITH: Los Angeles City Councilman Hal Bernson, who has one of 
the city's largest mosques in Granada Hills as part of his San Fernando 
Valley-based district, has seconded a motion to spend $6,000 of city money to 
help local Muslims. 
</P>
<P>
 The motion -- originally made by Councilwoman Jackie Goldberg of Hollywood, 
who also has a mosque in her district -- would pay the Islamic Center of 
Southern California for its cost of renting the L.A. Convention Center three 
weeks ago to celebrate the end of Ramadan, the Muslim holy month. 
</P>
<P>
 But City Atty. James Hahn's office has signaled that for the city to help 
underwrite the March 13 event, which drew about 15,000 Muslim participants, 
would involve an improper mixing of church and state matters. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Hahn's views have given the council offices pause, the Muslims are 
reminding Goldberg and Bernson that in 1993, for example, the council voted to 
spend $35,000 to help subsidize the cost of a Baptist group that met at the 
Convention Center. "I'm sensing there's some discrimination going on because 
Muslims are a misunderstood minority," said Salam Al-Marayati, a spokesman for 
the local Islamic community. 
</P>
<P>
 But Veronica Gutierrez from Goldberg's office said the problem is not bias, 
but just a simple misunderstanding and predicted quick council approval of the 
Goldberg-Bernson motion.

<P>
 * Your editorial "When Science Lies to the Public" (March 31) is correct in 
voicing consternation over fraudulent practices in clinical trials, but does a 
disservice in promoting fear about treatment practices based on false data, and 
in echoing concerns about the pervasiveness of laxity in the overseeing of 
clinical research. Treatment practices are (should) never adopted based on a 
single study unless backed by a vast amount of supporting data, and preferably 
by another study confirming the findings.What may be profoundly upsetting to 
millions of women (your words) has been brought about by statements from 
tabloids and from politicians. The concerns about laxity are raised by 
condemning Dr. Bernard Fisher's actions upon discovering the fraudulent 
entries. His age is mentioned, hinting that it may be relevant. But why has he 
been tried and convicted by innuendo before carefully reviewing how he dealt 
with the fraud? Such condemnation without proper review is bringing to a halt 
vital clinical research. 
</P>
<P>
 As for tarnishing Dr. Fisher's reputation, the editor and readers should be 
made aware of the fact that he was -- through clearly developed concepts and 
skillful dynamism -- the most dominant figure in the reduction of mutilation 
radical mastectomies, and the architect of lifesaving therapies following 
surgery. The real fear is that without his clear thinking millions will be 
relegated to the chaotic practices on breast cancer dictated by many lesser 
minds.

ESCALON TO CLOSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I am a teacher at Escalon Center in Altadena. Our campus serves a population 
of students who have been labeled severely emotionally disturbed and/or 
unmanageable by the school district.Many of our students come from abusive 
homes and impoverished communities. These children have been dismissed from 
public schools for a variety of reasons; since 1959, Escalon has been there to 
provide a place for these forgotten students.  
</P>
<P>
 In addition to academic services, Escalon provides counseling, social programs 
and community outreach programs, so that our students have the best chance 
possible for happy, successful lives. 
</P>
<P>
 In June, Escalon will be forced to close its doors forever, due to 
overwhelming financial difficulties. I believe this to be a monumental tragedy. 
In addition to a number of dedicated staff members now facing the prospect of 
unemployment, over 80 students who have worked very hard to be a part of 
something and better themselves will be forced to start over, learn to trust 
all over again, or be left with nothing and nowhere to go.

THE SYMBOLISM OF FLYING COACH; ADMINISTRATORS OF STATE-FUNDED UNIVERSITIES MUST 
SEE REALITIES OF HARD TIMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Politicians want to be against what everyone is against. That's how they get 
elected: by promising to be leaders who will follow. But once in a while, they 
get in trouble by trying to follow in two directions at once. 
</P>
<P>
 "Three strikes and you're out" is a case in point. This is a law that will 
cost California, in money out of pocket, astronomical sums. Where will the 
money come from? Higher education is the only major item of discretionary 
spending left in California's budget. Either higher education goes down or 
taxes go up. Politicians who want to be pro-"three strikes" and anti-tax have 
got to be anti-higher education. It's that simple, and don't think the 
politicians haven't noticed. 
</P>
<P>
 Needless to say, nobody can be against higher education as such. The political 
trick is to attack wretched excesses of one sort or another in higher 
education: trivial research, leisurely professorial lifestyles and so forth. 
</P>
<P>
 The case perennially in point is the compensation of administrators. How big a 
part of the University of California's budget consists of top administrators' 
salaries? One way to answer is to go to the most extreme estimate anyone has 
ever offered of how much money could be cut from every critic's favorite 
example of bloat: UC systemwide administration. Budget gadfly Charles Schwartz 
says $200 million to $300 million could be saved. But the full annual UC budget 
is $9.4 billion.  
</P>
<P>
 The university is not going to make or break its budget by what happens in the 
administrative salary category. That said, it has been folly for top 
administrators both at the University of California and the California State 
University not to recognize the symbolic importance of big raises and luxurious 
paid leaves for administrators. It serves too many politicians' purposes too 
well to portray higher education as one gigantic paid leave. In pure 
self-defense, UC President Jack W. Peltason, who has now ended the practice of 
paid leave, should have done so without being put under public pressure. The 
practice may be defensible as a way to attract the managerial talent needed to 
run a $9.4-billion operation. But in the post-"three strikes" budget climate, 
continuing it was institutionally suicidal.

CRIME WATCH; STRIKING OUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 California is starting to look beyond the political rhetoric of the new "three 
strikes" law and consider the local impact. The picture isn't pretty -- and 
should cause voters considerable pause in November. 
</P>
<P>
 An Orange County Administrative Office report this week addressed the likely 
effects of the new law, which mandates prison sentences of 25 years to life for 
those convicted three times of violent or so-called serious crimes. The report 
provides grounds for opposing a similar "three strikes" statute that will be on 
the November ballot. For one thing, the ballot measure largely duplicates the 
recently passed law; for another, the costs of implementing any "three strikes" 
measure are likely to be greater than first thought. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County officials predicted the need for many more trials as felons 
refuse plea bargains; and the increased level of incarceration will probably 
force jails to release drunken drivers, burglars and other "minor" criminals 
sooner than they should. The law also will trigger a greater demand for welfare 
benefits from convicts' families; more children from convict families will wind 
up in government custody.  
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Dist. Atty. Gil Garcetti already has stopped filing new cases 
involving worker safety, environmental crimes and major fraud in order to 
handle the "three strikes" load. 
</P>
<P>
 New state prisons will cost billions to build and operate. The months ahead 
are likely to spell out the true costs of hasty, politically expedient 
legislation. Passage of a "three strikes" ballot measure would merely compound 
the error.

BLACK ART, AMERICAN ART 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the American ethnic chorus, there are some songs that only some singers can 
sing and others that every group sings in its own way. Thursday, on the 20th 
anniversary, to the day, of the opening of Ambassador Auditorium, the 
Ambassador Foundation presented its Award for Excellence to soprano Leontyne 
Price after a concert at which Price sang, among other works, Giuseppe Verdi's 
Pace, pace mio Dio.  
</P>
<P>
 When Price sings Verdi, is white music sung in a black way? We might better 
say that 19th-Century Italian music is sung in a Leontynian way. But Italian 
grand opera, when a black diva sings it, becomes a part of the greater black 
American sound and, in turn, a part of the greater American sound. 
</P>
<P>
 Last Tuesday, at the Claremont Graduate School, the $50,000 Kingsley Tufts 
Poetry Award -- the largest in the world awarded for a given title -- was 
presented to poet Yusef Komunyakaa for his collection "Neon Vernacular." Some 
of Komunyakaa's themes lie deep in the least communicable part of black 
American experience. His success here may in fact be his greatest success. But 
a good many of his themes are, so to put it, a black rendition of songs that 
non-blacks also sing. Consider the opening lines of his widely anthologized 
"Facing It": 
</P>
<P>
 My black face fades, hiding inside the black granite. I said I wouldn't, 
dammit: No tears. I'm stone. I'm flesh. My clouded reflection eyes me like a 
bird of prey, the profile  
</P>
<P>
 of night slanted against morning. I turn  
</P>
<P>
 this way -- the stone lets me go. I turn that way -- I'm inside the Vietnam 
Veterans Memorial again, depending on the light to make a difference.  
</P>
<P>
 Visiting the Vietnam Veterans Memorial is not, in any exclusive sense, "the 
black experience," but a black face reflects back from the black granite in its 
own way. 
</P>
<P>
 Komunyakaa, a veteran of the military, makes poetry of the moment not in 
"black English" but in a vernacular English that every American ear can hear. 
He writes for everybody, as Leontyne Price sings for everybody. Last week, a 
good few Southern Californians seemed to be listening.

WHEN SILENCE CAN BE DEAFENING; RABIN STAYS COURSE; ARAFAT DUCKS SPEAKING OUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There cannot be a justifiable reason, an acceptable excuse or mitigating 
circumstances for the escalating terrorist attacks on Palestinian and Israeli 
civilians that are now so clearly aimed at sabotaging peace talks between the 
two parties. All such atrocities deserve -- demand -- universal condemnation, 
wherever they occur and by whomever they are carried out. 
</P>
<P>
 An attack that coldbloodedly aims at killing and maiming schoolchildren is of 
an especially despicable order. The car bomb that was exploded next to a bus 
picking up students in the Israeli town of Afula this week, a manly deed for 
which the Islamic militant group Hamas heaps praise on itself, was simply and 
horribly an act of vicious moral cowardice. And the failure of Yasser Arafat to 
condemn it immediately and unqualifiedly was a shameful display of political 
gutlessness. 
</P>
<P>
 The silence of the chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization -- which 
for 20 years has insisted that it is the sole legitimate representative of the 
Palestinian cause -- is all the more striking in light of Israeli Prime 
Minister Yitzhak Rabin's harsh condemnation of the attack last month on 
Palestinian worshipers in the Hebron mosque, and the public inquiry Israel has 
been conducting into that crime. Why has Arafat had nothing to say, leaving it 
to his underlings to issue a weak and belated expression of "regrets"? Clearly 
it's because he fears offending Palestinian radicals more than he worries about 
giving offense to Israel or to the United States, whose President has publicly 
urged him to speak out. Arafat's silence is not a sign of his independence. 
Rather it's an admission of his increasingly shaky position among Palestinians 
and his lack of control. 
</P>
<P>
 The peace process, to the frustration of both its Palestinian and Israeli 
enemies, will survive this week's attacks in Afula and Ashdod just as it 
survived the Hebron mosque massacre. The radicals and the crazies will, of 
course, keep trying to sabotage it with new acts of terrorism. For now -- 
certainly in Israel and almost certainly among the Palestinians -- the 
opponents of peace remain a distinct minority. But atrocities have a cumulative 
effect, with each adding to the numbers of those who are inclined to doubt that 
the two peoples can ever coexist in relative peace. The best answer to that 
skepticism is to keep the peace talks moving, no matter what the provocations 
by militants and lunatics. 
</P>
<P>
 The Israeli government deserves considerable credit for staying the course, 
under these most trying circumstances. For his part, Arafat says he's as 
committed to that process as Rabin. Some appropriate condemnation of this 
week's acts of Palestinian terrorism would have done much to underscore that 
commitment.

HILLARY CLINTON'S FUTURES TRADING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * In response to your article "Hillary Clinton's Futures Trades Unusual, 
Experts Say," March 31: 
</P>
<P>
 Mrs. Clinton is the victim of sexist critics who resent the fact that she is a 
bold and assertive woman. She is being criticized for her willingness to take 
risks, resulting in her turning small amounts of money into large amounts -- 
something a man would be congratulated and admired for doing. Her critics 
cannot accept that a woman could have made such profitable investments. 
</P>
<P>
 Sure, some of her investments went sour (including Whitewater), but overall 
she came up ahead. It's time for this nation to grow up and give women the 
credit they deserve. 
</P>

 * Have any of your reporters investigated that possibility that Hillary 
Clinton may have won the California lottery? As a frequent visitor to the 
state, she certainly has had the opportunity to enter the lottery. It would 
make a marvelous story. 
</P>
<P>
 Winning the lottery is, of course, suspicious in itself. You could quote 
anonymous experts on the virtual impossibility of winning the lottery without 
good connections. Did Hillary get advice from Nancy Reagan's astrologer? 
</P>
<P>
 If it turns out that Hillary never won in the lottery, that is equally 
damning. If she had bought a ticket, she might have won a bundle under highly 
suspicious circumstances. Not even a Democrat could pass up that opportunity! 
Obviously, she was frightened out of buying a ticket by the possibility of 
investigation and disclosure. Whom was she trying to protect? 
</P>
<P>
 Why don't you drop that dumb cattle futures investment story and get cracking 
on something really good?

<P>
 * Whatever the legal or ethical fallout is from the financial manipulations in 
Arkansas 10 to 15 years ago, it is not likely, in itself, to inflict terminal 
political damage on the Clintons. Rather, it is the revelation that Bill and 
Hillary are an ordinary, garden variety, yuppie couple who freely speculated in 
the high-risk real estate and commodity trading practices of the roaring '80s, 
an era whose alleged greed and corruption in just these types of investment has 
been so loudly condemned by both of them. This self-evident hypocrisy robs the 
Clintons of any claim to champion the poor, the honest or even the politically 
correct. In a word, they are not what they say they stand for.  
</P>
<P>
 In politics, the appearance and mystique of things is fundamental. The 
Clintons lack sufficient political capital in other areas to ride out an 
assault on their personal character, which is the real issue in Whitewater. To 
lose this battle is to lose everything, which explains why the White House 
staffers' mad dash to cover up makes perfectly good -- indeed indispensable -- 
sense to anyone except lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
 And, for the same reason, certain phases of the cover-up probably must 
continue. If it should become evident, sooner or later, that Vincent Foster -- 
finding himself morally trapped between the dictates of shielding his friends' 
reputation from exposure and his own professional integrity -- thus took his 
own life, political disaster is unavoidable. Even the morally numbed American 
body politic would pull down a President who extracted this "last full measure 
of devotion" from a friend.

<P>
 Attack the evidence (the Leaches in Congress, radio, TV and the print media 
know only of slurs and rumor). 
</P>
<P>
 Attack the law (to avoid libel, they must admit no law was broken; therefore, 
no law to dispute).

 Attack the man and woman (their last resort is to challenge character,

</P>
<P>
 Ms. Estrich just doesn't get it. Whitewater and Watergate have a lot more in 
common than water. Both concern primarily questions concerning the character, 
trust and ethics of a sitting President (and in Whitewater an unelected but 
very active spouse and her former law and business partners). 
</P>
<P>
 People are rightly judged by the company they keep. Let the facts come out.

DIDN'T ELIOT NESS TEACH US ANYTHING?; TOBACCO: PROHIBITION DIDN'T WORK; BANNING

 John Gotti, ranking crime boss of our federal prison system, must be kicking 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
 Hard. 
</P>
<P>
 A lifetime guest of the government's notorious Marion, Ill., hostelry, the 
former Teflon Don is about to miss out on a crime spree that will send hundreds 
of capos and button men scurrying for a piece of the action. So juicy will this 
score become, its profits are liable to make loan-sharking, drugs, gambling and 
all-purpose racketeering look like side bets at a nickel craps game. 
</P>
<P>
 We are, all of us law-abiding, tax-paying John Q. Publics, about to witness 
the single greatest incentive for larceny and lawbreaking since Prohibition 
made crooks of nannies. 
</P>
<P>
 With gathering speed and measured deliberation, sundry branches, departments 
and bureaucrats in that warren of probity known as Washington, D.C., move 
closer and closer to banning the manufacture and sale of cigarettes. 
</P>
<P>
 It will not happen tomorrow or next week. And not even next year or the year 
after. But it will happen. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometime soon, with calls for nationwide smoking bans and nicotine's 
regulation as a dangerous drug, Joe Camel, the Marlboro Man and Virginia Slim 
will toast the good times, take their last drags and walk off into the 
ozone-depleted sunset. 
</P>
<P>
 Find a bookie and bet on it. 
</P>
<P>
 That is, if all our smoke-filled, illegal betting dens haven't yet experienced 
a mass exodus of their resident ne'er-do-wells eager to do with tobacco what Al 
Capone did with gin: make millions giving the public what it wants. 
</P>
<P>
 And despite the efforts of the Treasury Department's storied Untouchables, 
enforcing the Volstead Act -- keeping beer, wine and cocktails from Jazz Age 
Americans -- proved that thousands of cops can't catch millions of bottles. 
Sound familiar? 
</P>
<P>
 So why wouldn't Gotti's heirs, as well as scores of semi-legitimate 
entrepreneurs, purloin every truck, barge, dinghy and skiff for easy fortunes 
amid tempting odds? 
</P>
<P>
 Need they create a market? Not while a nation of suicidal, smoke-starved 
adults, teens and kids resists the best evidence to the contrary. 
</P>
<P>
 Must they encounter difficulties with production and retailing? Not while the 
real cost of a pack hovers at less than a buck and millions of potential 
salespeople are jobless or underemployed.  
</P>
<P>
 Will police enforce a ban on cigarettes with determination and dispatch? Who's 
kidding whom? 
</P>
<P>
 But this is where we're headed, just as sure as cigarettes killed Bogie and 
stopped Duke Wayne. Cold. 
</P>
<P>
 So go ahead, Washington. Take your best shot. Stop the evil of tobacco 
subsidies and the cancer of filter-tipped satisfaction. 
</P>
<P>
 Call them drugs, controlled substances or worse. 
</P>
<P>
 Make our beaches, parks and boulevards smoke-free. 
</P>
<P>
 With God and medicine on your side, how can you miss? 
</P>
<P>
 Just ask Eliot Ness.

STOCK OPTIONS AREN'T 'FREE' COMPENSATION; EXECUTIVE PAY: SHAREHOLDERS MAY FIND 
DOWN THE ROAD THAT UNDESERVING MANAGERS OWN A BIG CHUNK OF THE COMPANY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CALVIN H. JOHNSON, Calvin Johnson is Andrews and Kurth Centennial professor 
of law at the University of Texas School of Law at Austin. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 To the executives who get them as a perk, stock options are an extraordinarily 
valuable right, especially for risky high-tech or start-up companies. The 
holder of an option does not risk nor commit any capital to the corporation 
during the years that the corporation could certainly use the capital, but the 
holder nonetheless shares in the gains from the corporation's capital at the 
same rate as shareholders who did shoulder the risk. A holder of an option gets 
to buy the stock after the results are in. 
</P>
<P>
 Stock options are also popular on the corporate side because under current 
accounting standards, such options given to executives as compensation are 
reported on profit-loss statements as if they were cost-free. The Financial 
Accounting Standards Board, which sets the standards for corporate accounting, 
is seeking to change that rule and treat the value of the stock options as a 
cost that reduces the corporation's reported earnings. But executive 
compensation would be stingier if management were held accountable for the 
value of the options that they both give out and get. The accounting board is 
holding hearings this month in Connecticut and San Jose and can expect plenty 
of corporate pressure against any changes that would fairly account for the 
real costs of executive stock options. 
</P>
<P>
 The executives of a corporation are supposed to be the faithful servants of 
the shareholders, who own the business the executives run. The first purpose of 
accounting, both in history and in importance, is as the vehicle by which 
managers account to the owners as to how well they have managed the business. 
It is a feckless and faithless servant, indeed, who fails to mention as a cost 
in his official account the fraction of the business he has taken for himself. 
If the company is successful, the original owners will learn that they have 
lost a significant fraction of their company to their "faithful" managers 
because of "free" options issued years earlier. What investors would be willing 
to buy stock in an untried company, knowing that the fruits of their investment 
will be taken by executives should the company prove a success? 
</P>
<P>
 Treating executive stock options as cost-free pushes overall compensation 
upward. Any resource treated as free is inevitably overused: We have 
environmental problems in part because businesses have treated our air and our 
waters as free ways to dispose of wastes; the savings-and-loan industry made a 
"free" government guarantee program into a $2-trillion expense because neither 
the managers of the S & Ls nor the depositors considered deposit insurance to 
be a cost. And executives get too large a share of successful companies because 
the granting of stock options to the executives is considered free. 
</P>
<P>
 Stock options give bad signals to managers. A holder of a stock option tends 
to revel in risk: The holder can win big when risky projects are successful, 
without bearing the losses that shareholders bear. Executives with options have 
a self-serving interest in choosing projects that have too much risk. But when 
they do win, they often win without merit because of market fluctuations 
unrelated to the executive's performance or contribution. 
</P>
<P>
 Better forms of compensation, such as outright stock grants, are not used 
because they must be reported as a cost. Reporting the cost, however, is honest 
accounting.

PERSPECTIVE ON NORTH KOREA; CREATING A NUCLEAR STRAW MAN; THERE'S NO REAL 
EVIDENCE OF A THREAT EXCEPT IN THE EYES OF A PENTAGON NEEDING TO JUSTIFY ITS 
TWO-WAR BUDGET. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EUGENE J. CARROLL JR., Eugene J. Carroll Jr., a retired Navy rear admiral, 
is director of the Center for Defense Information in Washington. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 North Korea, lost for years in the back pages of newspapers and absent 
entirely from TV news, has re-emerged as headline material. 
</P>
<P>
 Always a hard case, certainly no friend of America, North Korea has quietly 
been disintegrating economically for decades while South Korea has become a 
powerful economic, political and military force in Northeast Asia. Now, with 
twice the population and 10 times the productive output of its neighbor, South 
Korea seems well situated to deal with any military threat it might perceive 
from North Korea. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1989, Pentagon representatives testified in Congress that "South Korean 
forces are capable of defending themselves against any threat from the North 
that does not involve either the Soviet Union or the Peoples' Republic of 
China." Since then, North Korea has made no significant change in its military 
forces or weapons and has cut its military spending in half ($4.1 billion to 
$2.2 billion). During the same period, South Korea has upgraded its forces 
qualitatively and increased defense spending almost 50% ($8.5 billion to $12.1 
billion). 
</P>
<P>
 It is difficult to explain how South Korea is more vulnerable now when it is 
outspending North Korea by a 6-1 margin and enjoys marked superiority in the 
quality of its military equipment, technology, mobility and support. 
</P>
<P>
 For this reason, Pentagon officials have been forced to highlight the North 
Korean nuclear program as a "new danger" in order to justify the official 
expressions of alarm now dominating the news. Secretary of Defense William J. 
Perry has issued a series of dramatic assessments of the growing nuclear threat 
from North Korea. On Easter Sunday, speaking on NBC's "Meet the Press," he 
raised the stakes by establishing a six-month time limit for North Korea to 
satisfy U.S. demands that it freeze its nuclear program. This is diplomacy by 
ultimatum, a notoriously unsuccessful negotiating technique when dealing with 
authoritarian leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 And what motivates the ultimatum? Just what great danger lurks north of the 
DMZ? According to Perry, North Korea may now have enough plutonium to build one 
or two nuclear explosive devices. That estimate is far from certain because it 
rests on the assumption that the North Koreans refueled their 5-megawatt 
reactor in 1989. If not, they do not have enough plutonium to make a 
firecracker. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if North Korea did refuel, further assumptions must be validated to 
postulate a nuclear threat: that North Korea has a reprocessing capability 
efficient enough to produce up to 15 kilograms of weapons-grade plutonium from 
the spent reactor fuel; that it has been able to fashion a reliable "trigger" 
to produce a significant explosion, and that it has been able to package their 
design in a configuration small enough for use as a deliverable weapon. 
</P>
<P>
 Unless all three assumptions are true, North Korea's nuclear program has 
little military significance, because possessing one or two explosive devices 
is a far cry from the ability to employ nuclear weapons for military purposes.  
</P>
<P>
 The tenuous proposition that we face a growing North Korean nuclear threat was 
weakened last December by then-Secretary of Defense Les Aspin. "Whatever 
happened in 1989, the situation is not deteriorating now." Aspin said. "They 
are not developing more plutonium to make more nuclear bombs." 
</P>
<P>
 Because it is really impossible to describe a credible current threat, Perry 
has now resorted to pointing with alarm at a hypothetical threat that will 
exist "two or three years from now (when) they're producing bombs at the rate 
of a dozen a year," a conclusion supported by arguable assumptions.  
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps this would ring truer if North Korea's neighbors were seeing the same 
threat. Unfortunately for our diplomacy, Russia, China, South Korea and Japan 
are not alarmed and are utterly unwilling to support U.S. ultimatums and 
demands for sanctions. These are the very nations at risk (as America is not), 
if North Korea can produce deliverable nuclear weapons. In truth, China and 
South Korea are far more concerned about Japan building up a huge stock of 
plutonium than they are about Kim Il Sung's meager nuclear effort. 
</P>
<P>
 All of the evidence suggests that American citizens are being subjected to a 
well-orchestrated Pentagon campaign to restore North Korea to enemy status. In 
order to justify a budget based on their current two-war strategy, our military 
needs two enemies. Because North Korea spends less than 1% of what we spend for 
military forces, it makes a satisfactory enemy only if the specter of nuclear 
weapons is raised as a scare tactic. The great danger in promoting this ominous 
image of nuclear danger is that our words and actions may create a military 
crisis where none exists, an outcome which could have tragic consequences.

ROME SAYS QUESTIONING WAS JUSTIFIED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE REILLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 TV and radio talk show host Jim Rome Thursday defended his questioning of 
former Ram quarterback Jim Everett, who attacked Rome during an interview on 
ESPN's "Talk 2" show Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Everett, traded to the New Orleans Saints last month, objected when Rome 
repeatedly called him by the name of female tennis star "Chris Evert," a 
derisive reference to Everett's perceived reluctance to be hit on the football 
field. 
</P>
<P>
 After Rome called Everett "Chris" a third time, the quarterback knocked over a 
table and shoved the host to the floor. 
</P>
<P>
 "I stand by what I did," Rome said on XTRA radio. "But I regret it happening. 
</P>
<P>
 "I regret hitting him with (the Chris reference) a third time. But he got in 
my face and challenged me." 
</P>
<P>
 No punches were thrown. Rome was uninjured, but he complained that coffee 
spilled on his sport coat during the fracas. He said he doesn't plan to press 
charges and that he tried Thursday to invite Everett back on the air, but 
couldn't reach him. 
</P>
<P>
 Rome said Everett did not apologize Wednesday, but accused him of "looking for 
ratings." Rome denied that the confrontation was a publicity ploy, adding that 
producer Mark Shapiro had twice warned Everett he would be called "Chris." He 
said Everett did not object. 
</P>
<P>
 Rome is known for jousting with interview subjects and giving them nicknames, 
but he said this was his first physical confrontation on a show. 
</P>
<P>
 He has referred to injury-prone Joe Montana as "China Doll," former Raider 
Howie Long as "Howard the Duck" and the Kings' Marty McSorley as "Marty 
McCash." He drew criticism last year when he dubbed Monica Seles "T-Bone" after 
the tennis player was stabbed by a spectator during a tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Everett could not be reached for comment Thursday. He told a Las Vegas 
television station Wednesday night that he expected "a full apology" from ESPN.

DOW RISES FOR THIRD STRAIGHT DAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Stocks gained for the third day in a row Thursday as share prices continued 
their glue-like attachment to bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 Buyers returned as interest rates retreated after Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan 
expressed no inflation worries and did not refer to rates in a speech to a 
banker group. 
</P>
<P>
 Shares also rose despite another round of statistics showing strong economic 
growth. Such numbers have in recent weeks spurred fears in the stock and bond 
markets of higher interest rates and inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 These fears have been at the heart of the recent selloff in both markets, so 
the lack of a decline Thursday led analysts to express hope that the worst may 
be over. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow Jones industrial gained 13.53 points to close at 3,693.26. Rising 
issues outpaced losers by a 9-to-5 margin on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Tuesday, the blue chip index has gained nearly 100 points after 
plummeting more than 200 points in six out of seven previous trading sessions 
in a massive wave of selling sparked by rising interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 In the bond market, the Treasury's key 30-year bond yield fell to 7.20% from 
the previous day's 7.24%. Its price, which moves in the opposite direction, 
rose 3/8 point, or $3.75 per $1,000 in face value. 
</P>
<P>
 Stock investors have moved in lock-step with bonds, fearing high rates will 
prompt an exodus from stocks into safer, interest-bearing investments such as 
CDs. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking in San Francisco, Greenspan focused on the negative consumer outlook 
despite the economy's healthy long-term outlook. 
</P>
<P>
 The tone of Greenspan's remarks convinced economists that the Fed was unlikely 
to ratchet up rates again soon, after tightening credit twice since Feb. 4. 
</P>
<P>
 "To the extent that you don't get someone like Greenspan beating you on the 
head, I think people are willing to step up and buy into the stocks," said Tom 
Kirkenmeier, vice president with Northern Trust. 
</P>
<P>
 Also providing fresh support for the bond market's advance was buying from 
individual investors, fund managers and other players who until recently had 
shied away from the shaky market, financial analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the positive economic news, the Commerce Department reported that American 
businesses plan to increase investments in new building and equipment by 8% 
this year on top of last year's 7.1% rise. This would be the biggest jump in 
capital investment since an 11.4% increase in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Many major retailers on Thursday reported double-digit sales gains in March, 
thanks in part to pre-Easter spending. On Wednesday, auto makers also reported 
a healthy March, with Detroit's Big Three all saying they sold at least 10% 
more cars than the year-earlier period. 
</P>
<P>
 Broader market indexes also closed higher. The Standard & Poor's 500 stock 
index posted a gain 2.83 to 450.88, while the Nasdaq index of mostly smaller 
stocks gained 4.45 to 755.17. Big Board volume retreated to 289.28 million 
shares, from Wednesday's 302 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Cyclical stocks, such as paper, raw materials and heavy machinery, which 
rise and fall with expectations for the economy, started weak, but also gained 
through the day. DuPont was up 1 1/8 to 55 1/4, but International Paper was 
down 1 to 66 1/8. If there is renewed inflation and higher interest rates, 
investors in these cyclical stocks fear the economic recovery would be hampered 
enough to hurt profits. 
</P>
<P>
 * Bank stocks benefited from lower bond yields, which decrease their cost of 
borrowing. Chemical Bank gained 1 5/8 to 38. 
</P>
<P>
 * Several computer stocks helped push up the Nasdaq index. Sun Microsystems, 
which reported strong quarterly earnings Wednesday, gained 3 1/8 to 25 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Many retailing stocks rallied on the heels of strong same-store figures for 
March. Federated Department Stores rose 7/8 to 23 7/8, Dayton Hudson rose 1 5/8 
to 78 3/4 and The Gap added 2 1/4 to 49. 
</P>
<P>
 * But Tandy Corp. collapsed 3 5/8 to 32 1/2 on disappointing sales in March by 
the nation's largest consumer electronics retailer. 
</P>
<P>
 * Seat cover-maker Lear Group rose to 18 1/8 from its 15 1/2 initial public 
offering price. 
</P>
<P>
 Molecular Dynamics fell 3 7/8 to 6 1/8 after it said it expected a large first 
quarter loss and a drop in sales. 
</P>
<P>
 Stocks closed higher again in overseas trading. Tokyo's Nikkei 225-share 
average closed up 194.24 points at 19,890.98. In Frankfurt, the DAX index ended 
10.21 points higher on the day at 2,201.41, while in London, the Financial 
Times 100-share average closed down 2.5 points at 3,129.0. 
</P>
<P>

THEATER REVIEW; TAPER BRINGS THE 'DEMON' BACK TO LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON SHIRLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In 1899, Anton Chekhov wrote to a would-be publisher of his then-10-year-old 
"The Wood Demon": "I despise this play and am trying to forget I ever wrote it. 
. . . It would be a severe blow if anyone tried to revive it." 
</P>
<P>
 Too bad, Chekhov. The Mark Taper Forum has done the deed you so feared. The 
play lives. And in the hands of the Antaeus Company, the Taper's new classical 
ensemble, the play thrives in most of the first three acts, becoming forced 
only in the fourth. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, many of its characters have lived over the intervening century in 
Chekhov's "Uncle Vanya," which borrowed so much from the earlier play that it's 
easy to see "The Wood Demon" as a rough draft. These unhappy Russian gentry 
were even spotted at the Taper -- back in 1969, when Harold Clurman staged 
"Uncle Vanya" there. 
</P>
<P>
 Once again, crotchety Prof. Serebryakov and his young, bored second wife 
Yelena are living on the country estate of the professor's late first wife. The 
deceased's brother (here named Zhorzh instead of Vanya), who also lives there, 
still has an intense and unrequited passion for Yelena. 
</P>
<P>
 The offspring of the professor's first marriage, 20-year-old Sonya, is still 
fascinated by a country doctor and ardent environmentalist (here named 
Khrushchov instead of Astrov but usually called "The Wood Demon"). 
Vanya/Zhorzh's mother still lives with the family, and they still have a 
garrulous neighbor nicknamed Waffles. 
</P>
<P>
 Less focused than "Uncle Vanya," "The Wood Demon" gives four additional 
friends and neighbors plenty of lines, mostly for comic relief. More characters 
mean more roles for members of the 69-actor Antaeus Company, but it also 
translates into a longer sit -- including its two intermissions, this "Wood 
Demon" lasts three hours and 10 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of that time is well spent. The agonies and ecstasies of these people are 
keenly expressed in this spirited new translation by two Antaeus members, 
Nicholas Saunders and Frank Dwyer. Only one quibble comes to mind -- Zhorzh 
insults Professor Serebryakov by calling him a perpetuum mobile . An earlier 
translator used "non-stop writing machine," which might work better for a 
non-Latin-speaking audience. 
</P>
<P>
 The company worked on this project for three years -- about 10 times longer 
than the time spent on most Taper projects. Each role has been cast with at 
least two actors, so the composition of the cast is likely to change at each 
performance. Dwyer's staging never appears wayward or uncertain. The talk is 
punctuated with brief bursts of physical comedy and telling non-verbal details, 
as when Serebryakov keeps eating his lunch while everyone else is paying rapt 
attention to the Wood Demon's save-the-forest speech. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time, the Taper has become an arena stage, with a small section 
of seating on the north side. At first, from a vantage point on the south, this 
added the intended intimacy, which is also encouraged by D Martyn Bookwalter's 
canopy of greenery covering the entire hall. 
</P>
<P>
 But during the last act, from a seat on the new north side, there were 
problems with sight lines -- most notably when the entire cast looks at the 
light from a distant forest fire, with backs turned toward those of us on the 
north. Instead of faces, we saw the lights, busily creating the fire effect for 
the other spectators. Some of the other sight lines might be improved if the 
north seats were simply installed at a sharper rake. 
</P>
<P>
 The ending of the play has other problems, too. "The Wood Demon" is touted as 
lighter than "Uncle Vanya," with a supposedly happy ending. This is misleading. 
One of the "Wood Demon" characters succeeds at suicide. In "Uncle Vanya," the 
same character tries only to shoot someone else -- and twice misses, turning 
the episode into a grim joke. 
</P>
<P>
 Furthermore, two of the three couplings at the end of "The Wood Demon" will 
surely result in less happiness, not more. One of these matches, between two 
minor characters, is especially contrived, and yet Chekhov gave this couple the 
final scene in the play, where it seems especially superfluous. 
</P>
<P>
 This is not to slight the actors, however. The cast at the press preview was 
superb. And it was tantalizing to read, for example, that Nike Doukas, who was 
playing Sonya, also plays Yelena -- in many ways Sonya's opposite. The value of 
maintaining an ongoing classical company at the Taper has never been more 
apparent.

THEATER / T.H. MCCULLOH; UNLOCKING ALLURE OF 'SECRET GARDEN'; ORANGE COAST 
COLLEGE PRODUCTION OF CHILDREN'S CLASSIC CAPTURES ITS TIMELESS CHARM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Some stories are truly timeless. No matter how often they unfold before you, 
no matter how many versions appear, there are always a few tears left when that 
right moment comes. 
</P>
<P>
 One of those tales is Frances Hodgson Burnett's "The Secret Garden" which, in 
spite of a few flaws in this Orange Coast College production, keeps the eyes of 
its predominantly young audience glued to the stage. 
</P>
<P>
 The adaptation is by Pam Sterling, mostly in story theater form, with opening 
and closing narration by the cast, and a central narrator (Sofia Moraes), who 
also plays the friendly red-breasted robin who becomes the first real friend 
the young heroine finds in her new home. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of Moraes' lines are lost in indistinct diction, but she's a delight as 
the recorder-tootling bird that guides little Mary to the key to the secret 
garden and to her happiness. 
</P>
<P>
 Orphaned in India, Mary Lennox is thrust into an unfriendly, typically British 
Gothic manor house, Misselthwaite, in Yorkshire. Her dour Uncle Archibald (Troy 
M. Johnson) is a cipher, still mourning the death of his young wife 10 years 
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary's new world is forbidding, from the generic bitter housekeeper, Mrs. 
Medlock (Debi Ham), to Archibald's physician brother (Donovan T. McGrath), who 
is out to take the estate on Archibald's death. The only problem is Archibald's 
son Colin, Mary's cousin, who is secreted in his room and kept ill by his 
grasping uncle. 
</P>
<P>
 The production lights up when Mary finally discovers Colin and realizes that 
he is no more ill than she is. Heather deMichele's direction is sure 
throughout, her staging inventive on the large Robert B. Moore Theatre stage, 
and she has imbued the production with a fine sense of place, period and mood. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 What she hasn't done is give some of her actors a sense of the style this 
gentle, wispy piece needs, nor the feeling that they're doing much more than 
reciting lines. 
</P>
<P>
 Ham's housekeeper, McGrath's doctor, and Eric Scott Holme's stagy, affected 
Dickon -- the boy who helps Mary bring the garden to life -- are cardboard 
figures. Johnson's uncle is miles ahead in believability, as is Peter Kreder's 
warm, befuddled gardener Ben. 
</P>
<P>
 Michelle Rypinski is a delight as Mary, snippy and sour on her arrival, 
gradually and seamlessly waking with bubbling high spirits to the joy of her 
new life and her new friendships. 
</P>
<P>
 Anna Fitzwater's servant Martha, Dickon's sister, sparkles with humor, even in 
her moments of terror at Mrs. Medlock's approach. And Steven El Ray Musil is a 
marvelous Colin, spoiled and unhappy when first discovered, then seamlessly 
changing his image to one of hope and health as his relationship with Mary 
grows. Both Rypinski and Musil are taller than some of the adults, but they 
actually foster the belief that they are small, and very young, and very 
vulnerable.

MUSIC REVIEW; PACIFIC SYMPHONY'S BRAHMS SOARS, GRIEG SINKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN BLISS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Pacific Symphony distinguished itself with a powerful reading of Brahms' 
Fourth Symphony on Wednesday at the Orange County Performing Arts Center. Under 
Carl St.Clair's decisive leadership, the work emerged both structurally clear 
and musically purposeful. 
</P>
<P>
 St.Clair directed a disciplined group, marked by the technical refinement 
required to effectively create overall grandeur, as well as to control shifting 
moods and intelligent interplay of ideas. 
</P>
<P>
 The E-minor symphony brimmed with mystery, brooding and excitement, punctuated 
by dark solos -- particularly the horns' pressing passage in the first movement 
and the principal flute's plaintive line in the last movement, as offered by 
Louise Di Tullio. 
</P>
<P>
 First violins showed notable synchrony and unity of phrasing as captained by 
guest concertmaster Joel Pitchon. The Connecticut resident is concertmaster of 
the Greenwich Symphony and the Mid-Atlantic Sinfonietta. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast to this very consistent performance, that of Grieg's popular Piano 
Concerto in A minor, Opus 16, seemed distinctly uneven in the hands of 
25-year-old soloist Artur Pizarro. 
</P>
<P>
 The Portuguese-born pianist brought a large range of dynamics and a mostly 
dependable technique to bear. He also demonstrated a rhythmic sense that served 
enticingly during the Norwegian dance of the final movement, a dance made 
almost brutal through the orchestra's sharply accented accompaniment. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Pizarro's account proved all too predictable -- reliable and pleasant 
enough, but devoid of urgency and without lyrical magic. Moreover, his tone 
quality wavered; he managed to draw attractive and mellifluous sound from his 
instrument during quiet moments, but pounded mercilessly through loud, chordal 
sections. 
</P>
<P>
 Sensual enchantment defined Debussy's "Prelude to an Afternoon of a Faun," 
however. Here, the orchestra luxuriated in a kaleidoscope of changing colors. 
St.Clair permitted the piece to unfold leisurely.

STRONG EFFORT BY MARTINEZ IS NOT ENOUGH FOR DODGERS; BASEBALL: HE GIVES UP ONLY 
A FIRST-INNING RUN TO MARLINS, BUT HAMMOND, HARVEY MAKE THAT STAND UP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 He usually takes so much time between pitches that it's hard to keep track of 
the guy at the plate. Could it still be the same batter? 
</P>
<P>
 So Ramon Martinez said recently that he wasn't going to pitch slowly anymore. 
He said he doesn't want to think too much on the mound, because when he won all 
those games in the early '90s, he never used to think out there at all. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the first inning Thursday night against the Florida Marlins, Martinez 
was thinking. He was behind in the count and, before the inning was over, he 
gave up a run-scoring single to Jeff Conine in a 1-0 loss to the Marlins in the 
series finale at Dodger Stadium.  
</P>
<P>
 Then, Martinez settled down. He started to pitch so fast that the batters fell 
quickly. He retired 20 of the next 24 batters and struck out 10 in eight 
innings. The last time he struck out 10 was Aug. 9, 1990, against the 
Cincinnati Reds.  
</P>
<P>
 "He was throwing extremely, hard, the hardest I've seen him throw," Mike 
Piazza said of Martinez. "He had a dominant fastball, and he came inside well 
and sank it well. It's a shame that a performance like that was wasted." 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez would have stayed in the game to pitch the ninth, but the Dodgers, 
who couldn't do anything against Marlin starter Chris Hammond, needed to 
pinch-hit. Taking over for Martinez was Darren Dreifort, who made his major 
league debut, a fact mentioned by the Dodger public address announcer. Dreifort 
is the first Dodger since Sandy Koufax in 1955 to make his pitching debut 
without playing in the minor leagues. 
</P>
<P>
 For Dreifort, it was all part of what will become a cherished memory, because 
he retired the Marlins in order on three groundouts, and left the field to loud 
applause from what remained of the crowd of 30,027. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was nice to get out there," Dreifort said. "I was kind of calm and it 
surprised me. It was a real nice response that the crowd gave me. It made me 
feel really good. Ramon pitched a great game, and I wish we could have won it 
for him. But it was really nice for them to announce my debut, I didn't expect 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 For Martinez (0-1), the problem was that Hammond (1-0) was also working the 
inside corner well. With few exceptions, the Dodgers couldn't put anything 
together against the left-hander, who gave up only four hits in 7 2/3 innings 
-- two each by Brett Butler and Delino DeShields. Bryan Harvey pitched 1 1/3 
innings for his first save. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's probably the best I have ever thrown inside; it's probably the best 
game I have ever pitched," Hammond said. 
</P>
<P>
 When spring training ended, the Dodgers were more concerned with their 
starting pitching and not the least concerned about their offense. But they 
have managed only 16 hits and seven runs in three games. 
</P>
<P>
 "We realize we have to not get discouraged," said Piazza, who is one for 12. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know myself I am not swinging the bat too well, but it's such a long year I 
know I can't get anxious, which I feel like I have been the last three days." 
</P>
<P>
 In the first inning, after DeShields and Butler singled, DeShields was 
stranded at third. In the third, DeShields was stranded at second. And in the 
sixth, the Dodgers left the bases loaded. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Hammond) threw a great game, and some games will be like that," DeShields 
said. "Both pitchers threw well. We were in the game the whole way, just a hit 
here or there and we would be on top." 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez was inconsistent the last two seasons, never equaling his 
performances of 1990 and '91, when he won 37 games. Toward the end of the '91 
season, he was hit in the right arm by a line drive off the bat of Jack Howell, 
and he says it was after that when his performance began to decline. 
</P>
<P>
 "It makes me feel good and I feel so confident when I have my fastball," 
Martinez said. "I just had more and more and more confidence tonight. After I 
got hit in my arm, I started my struggling and I lost a little on my fastball 
and then I lost my confidence. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the past couple of years, I could not throw this hard. Now I feel more 
powerful. I worked out this winter and I feel much stronger. I gained 10 
pounds."

THE MASTERS; LEADERS HAVE A WONDERFUL EXPERIENCE; GOLF: 1987 CHAMPION MIZE 
SHOOTS 68 FOR ONE-SHOT ADVANTAGE. PIN PLACEMENTS, WIND TOUGHEN COURSE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN CHERWA, TIMES DEPUTY SPORTS EDITOR

<TEXT>
<P>
 One of the many unusual traits of Augusta National golf course is its ability 
to separate the stiffs from the stars -- to present the kind of leader board 
that excites you. Even at the start. 
</P>
<P>
 So, there's little surprise that after the first round of the Masters, the 
people who should be near the top are near the top. The common denominators are 
experience and ability, and in that order. 
</P>
<P>
 Larry Mize, whose miraculous 140-foot shot won the Masters in 1987, sits 
precariously atop the field after shooting a four-under-par 68. Being a 
veteran, Mize feels no great euphoria from leading, as golf tournaments can 
only be lost on Thursday, never won. 
</P>
<P>
 Sitting one stroke back at 69 are Tom Kite and South African Fulton Allem. At 
70 are Raymond Floyd, Seve Ballesteros, Tom Watson, Greg Norman, Tom Lehman and 
Vijay Singh. 
</P>
<P>
 The group at 71 includes Corey Pavin, Gary Player and Chip Beck. 
</P>
<P>
 Experience was clearly the determining factor Thursday, as of the 16 players 
who finished under par, the youngest is Singh at 31. The average age of those 
players is a rather time-tested 38.6 years. In fact, an American contingent of 
Kite, Watson, Floyd and Mize have a combined 290 competitive rounds among them 
at Augusta National. 
</P>
<P>
 The course was made difficult by a wind that swirled up to 25 m.p.h. and pin 
placements that had a sadistic twist to them. Tournament officials feared that 
an overnight rain might make the greens too soft, so the pins were in some of 
the most difficult positions. 
</P>
<P>
 "The tougher the course, the better the top players like it," Kite said. "You 
just couldn't miss a little bit today. It's hard to get a course to the edge, 
and I don't think we've had a course this close to the edge since the U.S. Open 
at Pebble Beach (in 1992)." 
</P>
<P>
 Kite won at Pebble Beach in '92. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the most deceptive feast-or-famine hole was the 15th, a 500-yard, par 
five. This was the hole where Gene Sarazen got his famous double-eagle in 1935. 
</P>
<P>
 The pin was cut to the left front about four yards from the edge of the green 
and staring into a huge slope that leads to water. Norman described the area as 
"slick as a baby's rear end." 
</P>
<P>
 When the wind was down, several of the longer hitters tried to reach the green 
in two and succeeded -- there were 21 birdies. But those who elected to lay up 
short of the water and try to finesse the ball to the cup with a wedge found 
trouble. Some evidence: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Watson took an eight, hitting his fourth shot into the water from behind 
the green, dropping him out of the lead. "It's a humbling game; you play 17 
good holes and all anyone wants to talk about is your eight," Watson joked. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Norman reached the green with his second shot, but the ball rolled back 
into the water. He still got his par. "If you would have placed the ball in 
front of the hole, it still would have gone in," Norman said. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Mize ended up in the water and took a six. "All considered, it was a great 
bogey," Mize said. 
</P>
<P>
 And then there was Nolan Henke, who had a 10, and Payne Stewart's nine and 
Steve Elkington's eight. All told, there were 41 pars, 10 bogeys, five 
double-bogeys, two triple-bogeys, two quadruple-bogeys and Henke's 
quintuple-bogey. 
</P>
<P>
 Equally schizophrenic as the 15th hole was Norman's round. He had one eagle, 
six birdies, five pars and six bogeys. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got the job done," Norman said. "That's what you've got to do in a major, 
but I just didn't have a feel for distance today. . . . It was a tough day out 
there. Larry's score requires a lot of patience. You just have to play with a 
lot of confidence."  
</P>
<P>
 Mize's confidence is well placed, given that he is a native Augustan. His 
first thought after his round was not about golf but whether the Atlanta Braves 
won Wednesday night's late game against the San Diego Padres. 
</P>
<P>
 Mize, 35, won two PGA Tour events last year and finished 13th on the money 
list. He had $1.3 million in worldwide earnings. 
</P>
<P>
 Last February, he underwent arthroscopic surgery to remove torn cartilage in 
his right knee. Mize never thought he was in danger of missing the Masters, but 
there was concern. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now, it feels fine," he said. "But you never know with those sorts of 
things." 
</P>
<P>
 Mize's position is familiar. Last year, he led the Masters after an opening 
67. He finished with rounds of 74-74-73, and tied for 21st place. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's actually fun to be leading today," he said. "And I think I enjoy it more 
than last year. . . . I don't even remember last year, what with my son being 
born and all that about this time. Everything was a blur." 
</P>
<P>
 The course probably will play a little easier today as the field starts to 
spread out. Nick Price, at 74, and Nick Faldo, at 76, are on the cusp of 
falling out of contention. But it should be remembered that eight Masters 
champions have won after shooting over par in the first round. The last was 
Jack Nicklaus in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 And speaking of Jack, you can count him out. He and Arnold Palmer each shot a 
78 and will probably have the weekend off. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps there are cases of having too much experience.

ANGELS LOSE, BUT FEEL SPECIAL; BASEBALL: EARLY OFFENSE, VICTORIES GIVE TEAM 
CONFIDENCE OF A CONTENDER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 The Angels boarded a flight Thursday after losing to the Minnesota Twins, 7-4, 
in a game of blown opportunities at the plate, botched plays in the field and 
ineffective pitching by one of their aces. 
</P>
<P>
 If that wasn't enough, they faced the cold reality of spending the weekend 
bundled up in Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
 You know something funny? 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels never felt better about themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 They left town knowing it's actually possible to win games in the Metrodome. 
Manager Buck Rodgers realizes now that this team has more offensive prowess 
than any since he joined the Angels; reliever Mike Butcher believes he is 
finally back and shortstop Gary DiSarcina is proud to say the feud between him 
and umpire Mark Johnson is over. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought we had confidence coming into this season," DiSarcina said, "but 
it's even greater now. It kind of reaffirmed what we've been thinking all 
along. We've got a good team." 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels (2-1) have already matched their Metrodome victory total of the 
last two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 "This hasn't been one of our favorite ballparks to play in," Rodgers said. 
"Minnesota has kicked our . . . pretty regularly. We at least proved we can win 
in this stadium." 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels simply couldn't win Thursday as starter Chuck Finley lasted only 4 
2/3 innings, yielding eight hits and six runs (five earned) while the offense 
self-destructed. The Angels had eight baserunners in the first three innings 
but somehow came away empty-handed. 
</P>
<P>
 They were caught stealing three times, twice in the first two innings, but it 
was their ineptitude in the third that eventually cost them any chance of 
winning. They loaded the bases against Scott Erickson with one out and had 
Eduardo Perez at the plate and Greg Myers on deck. Both struck out. And the 
Twins took full advantage. 
</P>
<P>
 Minnesota scored four runs in the fifth, which featured a two-run double by 
Dave Winfield and a two-out, run-scoring single by Scott Leius. The Angels fell 
behind, 7-0, after six innings and couldn't recover. 
</P>
<P>
 "The key, though, was that we never panicked," said DiSarcina, who is hitting 
.417 this season. "I guarantee you they never were able to relax." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the Angels wound up getting 14 hits, including a two-run homer by 
Chili Davis that cut the deficit to 7-4, but Twin closer Rick Aguilera quickly 
ended any idea of a comeback. Still. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "It's just nice to get off to a start like this because the start of a season 
really gets magnified," Rodgers said. "When you get off to a good start, you 
just have a good feeling things will work out. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course, I got off to a real good start in Milwaukee (in 1982) and I got 
fired in June." 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels were perhaps most encouraged by Butcher's performance. He was 
battered all spring, compiling a 14.81 earned-run average. Opponents batted 
.442 against him, but he abruptly regained his form Thursday. Butcher gave up 
one hit in 1 2/3 innings and woke up the crowd of 13,926 by firing a fastball 
over the head of Twin shortstop Jeff Reboulet. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was getting a little too comfortable in there," Butcher said, grinning. 
"But really, this was the best I felt all year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I woke up at 3:45 in the morning thinking about what was going wrong. I 
finally told myself, 'Just go out there and throw the ball instead of being 
somebody you're not.' 
</P>
<P>
 "It worked." 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, there was DiSarcina. He left town feeling good about his teammates 
and with new respect for umpire Johnson. A previous encounter this spring 
resulted in DiSarcina's ejection, threats by hitting coach Rod Carew and a 
police escort for the umpiring crew. 
</P>
<P>
 "He buried the grudge with me," DiSarcina said, "and I respect him now more 
than ever. He told me, 'Hey, whatever happened between me and you is over and 
done with.' That showed me a lot, and believe me, I won't forget it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe we didn't win today, but you know, there was something kind of special 
about this day."

<P>
 Denver's lead had been 6 1/2 games when Magic Johnson took over the Laker 
coaching job and it had shrunk to 2 1/2 games when the Nuggets continued to 
lose. 
</P>
<P>
 That ended Thursday night when Denver broke a four-game losing streak with a 
104-90 victory over the Seattle SuperSonics at home. 
</P>
<P>
 It halted Seattle's nine-game winning streak and pushed the Nuggets three 
games in front of the Lakers in the race for the eighth and final playoff spot 
in the West. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory was important for several reasons, not the least of which was that 
Denver plays the Lakers twice in the season's final 10 games. The first is 
tonight at the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
 Dikembe Mutombo had 11 blocked shots for the second consecutive game and also 
had 13 points and 13 rebounds for Denver. 
</P>
<P>
 The Nuggets' Reggie Williams led all scorers with 24 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Shawn Kemp led the SuperSonics with 20 points. 
</P>
<P>
 The Nuggets were without their top scorer, Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf, who had a 
strained hip, and Coach Dan Issel was ejected because of two technical fouls 
with 2:02 to play in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our players stepped it up after Dan got kicked out. This is probably the team 
we will play in the playoffs, so it was a real big win," assistant coach Gene 
Littles said. "We already had our game plan in place, so we didn't change much 
after Dan left. We just stepped up our level of play the last three quarters." 
</P>
<P>
 New Jersey 93, Atlanta 87 -- Derrick Coleman had 24 points and 13 rebounds at 
East Rutherford, N.J., where the Nets moved closer to a playoff berth by 
beating the Hawks. 
</P>
<P>
 Any combination of five Net victories or Charlotte losses will give New Jersey 
its third consecutive postseason berth. 
</P>
<P>
 Houston 134, Golden State 102 -- The Rockets set a franchise record for 
three-point shooting, hitting 12 of 17, and Hakeem Olajuwon had 26 points, 13 
rebounds and 10 assists for the eighth triple double of his career. 
</P>
<P>
 New York 97, Cleveland 94 -- Derek Harper hit his second three-pointer of 
overtime with 6.7 seconds to play, giving the Knicks a victory in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Utah 99, Dallas 82 -- Karl Malone scored 25 points in Salt Lake City as the 
Jazz won for only the third time in 12 games.

NHL ROUNDUP; FLYER OPPORTUNITY IS LOST IN SLOW MOTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The shot was long, tantalizingly slow and agonizingly effective. Philadelphia 
goalie Tommy Soderstrom saw it, then didn't see it again until he was fishing 
it out of the net behind him. 
</P>
<P>
 The Flyers might have lost a playoff spot because of it. 
</P>
<P>
 Gord Murphy's lazy back-hander from just inside the blue line at 6:11 of the 
third period gave the Florida Panthers a 3-3 tie at Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
 It left the Flyers three points behind Florida in the race for the eighth and 
final Eastern playoff spot with three games to play. 
</P>
<P>
 "We needed two points. We got one," Flyer Coach Terry Simpson said. "It puts 
us in a bit of a deeper hole. We have to win our games, but they can put us 
away by winning. We needed help before. We need some more now." 
</P>
<P>
 Boston 5, Ottawa 4 -- The Bruins rallied with goals by Daniel Morois and Bryan 
Smolinski in the third period at Boston. 
</P>
<P>
 Quebec 5, Hartford 2 -- Second-period power-play goals by Joe Sakic and Scott 
Young gave the Nordiques a victory at Quebec. 
</P>
<P>
 Vancouver 3, San Jose 2 -- Pavel Bure scored his league-leading 57th and 58th 
goals for the Canucks at home.

SHANAHAN, JANNEY STAY HOT AGAINST COLD KINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was encore night for the St. Louis Blues, who got two goals from Brendan 
Shanahan and three assists from Craig Janney for the second consecutive game. 
</P>
<P>
 Janney set up both of Shanahan's goals in Thursday night's 6-2 rout of the 
Kings, but didn't want any of the credit. 
</P>
<P>
 "Brendan has a lot to do with it," Janney said. "It's a lot harder to score 
goals than it is to make passes, that's for sure." 
</P>
<P>
 The Blues also got a solid game from goalie Curtis Joseph, who made 35 saves 
and stopped Mike Donnelly on a penalty shot with 4:39 to play. St. Louis held 
Wayne Gretzky, who has only one career goal against Joseph, to two harmless 
shots. 
</P>
<P>
 Joseph has faced four penalty shots in his career and has not given up a goal, 
although he said he didn't know why he's been so good in that situation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just try and stop it," Joseph said. "There's no specific technique, I don't 
think." 
</P>
<P>
 Donnelly was impressed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tried to come in fast, shoot quick and try to catch him before he could get 
his glove up," Donnelly said. "He made a great save. What can you do?" 
</P>
<P>
 He was even more impressed when he learned that Joseph was 4-0 on penalty 
shots. 
</P>
<P>
 "Is he?" Donnelly said. "That makes me feel better." 
</P>
<P>
 Janney is getting back into shape after sitting out 14 games because of a knee 
injury and being the compensation to Vancouver in the Petr Nedved free-agent 
signing. The Blues reacquired him on March 21, a week after he went to the 
Canucks. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm trying to get there," Janney said of is physical condition. "I don't 
think I'm 100% yet, but I had such a layoff." 
</P>
<P>
 Shanahan is zeroing in on his second consecutive 50-goal season, with 47 goals 
and four games remaining. He has scored seven goals in his last six games. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd be lying if I said I'm not going to try, but I'm certainly not going to 
be selfish or stop passing the puck or anything," Shanahan said. "It's not that 
important." 
</P>
<P>
 Shanahan added an assist, leaving him four points shy of his first 100-point 
season. He had 51 goals last season. 
</P>
<P>
 Luc Robitaille and Keith Redmond scored for the Kings, who are 9-24-7 on the 
road. 
</P>
<P>
 Brett Hull added his 55th goal for the Blues on a third-period centering pass 
that deflected into the net off the skate of the Kings' Tim Watters. 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin Miller's power-play goal at 7:04 of the first period, off a setup from 
Janney, put the Blues ahead, but not for long. Robitaille got his 42nd goal 28 
seconds later, scoring on a 45-foot drive from the right point. 
</P>
<P>
 The Blues regained the lead at 19:28 as Vitali Karamnov scored into an open 
right side on the finishing end of a three-way passing play that started with a 
backhand pass from Nedved to Phil Housley. 
</P>
<P>
 Shanahan got the only goal of the second period, beating goalie Kelly Hrudey 
from the right faceoff circle.

 Today is the 20th anniversary of Henry Aaron's record-breaking 715th home run 
and likely will be celebrated in major league cities. 
</P>
<P>
 "This means that Americans will be treated, ad nauseam , to one of the worst 
calls in the history of radio play-by-play," John Steigerwald of the Pittsburgh 
Post-Gazette wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 "Milo Hamilton is the guilty party and he screamed for the entire time that it 
took Aaron to circle the bases. All he needed to to say was, 'There it is . . . 
number 715,' and shut up." 
</P>
<P>
 That's what Vin Scully did. 
</P>
<P>
 Add Aaron: Al Downing of CBS Radio hopes to interview Aaron before the "Game 
of the Week" broadcast of the Dodger-Atlanta Brave game Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Downing reasons that Aaron owes him one. Perhaps. Downing, then pitching for 
the Dodgers, served up home run No. 715. 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia time: Who is the youngest player to win the Masters tournament? 
</P>
<P>
 Moo birds: Some players are accustomed to getting booed, but Jim Mouton of the 
Houston Astros has the distinction of being "mooed." 
</P>
<P>
 It started when he was introduced Monday as he was about to make his major 
league debut. Fans began calling out, "Moo, Moo," and they did it whenever he 
came to the plate or made a play in right field. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't pass out a script or anything, it just happened," Mouton said. 
"After a while, it got me pumped." 
</P>
<P>
 Keep moving: Even though he is the only skier left in a race to the North 
Pole, Norwegian Borge Ousland is not home free. He still faces deadly cold, 
thin ice and 263 miles of desolate Arctic terrain. 
</P>
<P>
 Ousland is projected to finish by May 1 -- if he doesn't encounter any hungry 
polar bears. 
</P>
<P>
 Holy cow!Harry Caray, now with the Chicago Cubs, is celebrating his 50th year 
of broadcasting this season. His son, Skip, and grandson, Chip, are also 
baseball broadcasters. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I'd only named myself Flip, we'd have Flip, Skip and Chip," Caray told the 
Chicago Sun-Times. 
</P>
<P>
 Add Caray: "I never eat before the game. I always eat after the game. I have 
my couple of martinis, a couple of bottles of Budweiser and a couple of Grand 
Marniers, and by the time I get home I'm feeling pretty good." 
</P>
<P>
 Golf's Bambino: Legendary golfer Gene Sarazen, 92, likened John Daly to Babe 
Ruth in welcoming him back on the PGA Tour, saying: 
</P>
<P>
 "If Babe Ruth didn't play, nobody came to the game. Nobody cares if John Daly 
shoots 80. They just want to see him hit a ball."

AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP; YANKEE BATS HOT BEFORE EMPTY SEATS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The smallest crowd at Yankee Stadium in 22 years got to see the most runs 
scored by the Yankees there in 39. 
</P>
<P>
 Before 5,851, Mike Gallego homered twice, Danny Tartabull drove in four runs 
and Bernie Williams hit a three-run homer into the center-field bleachers as 
New York routed the Texas Rangers, 18-6, Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 New York hadn't scored that many runs in Yankee Stadium since a 19-1 victory 
over the Washington Senators on April 13, 1955. The crowd hadn't been that 
small since Oct. 4, 1972, when 5,210 attended a game against the Milwaukee 
Brewers. 
</P>
<P>
 There was no advance sale because the game was a makeup of Wednesday's 
rainout. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were absolutely brutal today," Texas Manager Kevin Kennedy said. "We'll 
come back tomorrow, but I'm real disappointed." 
</P>
<P>
 New York had six doubles among its 19 hits. 
</P>
<P>
 Terry Mulholland, acquired from Philadelphia in the off-season, won in his 
Yankee debut, despite giving up six runs and seven hits in 5 1/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
 Five Texas pitchers walked nine and hit a batter. Kenny Rogers, the Rangers' 
leader in victories last year with 16, was chased after three-plus innings. He 
gave up eight earned runs and nine hits. 
</P>
<P>
 Wade Boggs had four hits for the second consecutive game: a double and three 
singles. Tartabull has six RBIs and 10 total bases in the Yankees' first two 
games. 
</P>
<P>
 Don Mattingly became the ninth Yankee in history to drive in 1,000 runs. 
</P>
<P>
 Boston 9, Detroit 6 -- With the wind blowing out to left field in Fenway Park, 
unusual this early in the season, the Red Sox had seven more extra-base hits, 
including home runs by Mike Greenwell, Andre Dawson and Tim Naehring, to finish 
a three-game sweep of the Tigers. 
</P>
<P>
 Of Boston's 30 hits this season, 16 have been for extra bases. 
</P>
<P>
 Detroit also had three homers -- two-run drives by Cecil Fielder and Dan 
Bautista and a solo shot by Lou Whitaker. 
</P>
<P>
 On a play when Detroit left fielder Eric Davis ran into the wall and had to 
leave the game, Greenwell had a triple and also added his second homer of the 
year. Dawson hit a two-run homer and drove in another run with a bases-loaded 
walk and Naehring's three-run shot made it 9-4 in the seventh inning. 
</P>
<P>
 Milwaukee 12, Oakland 2 -- Bill Wegman won his first game since May 30, and 
John Jaha and Kevin Seitzer hit two-run homers for the Brewers at Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
 Wegman, who lost his last seven decisions in 1993 and went 4-14, gave up only 
an unearned run and and five hits in seven innings as Milwaukee got 14 hits and 
beat Oakland for the 11th consecutive time at home. He struck out five and 
walked one. 
</P>
<P>
 Cleveland 6, Seattle 2 -- Jack Morris, coming off his worst season, pitched 
five scoreless innings before faltering in the sixth and led the Indians to a 
victory at home. 
</P>
<P>
 The Indians improved to 2-0, their best start since they won their first three 
games in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
 Eddie Murray hit the Indians' first home run of the season, driving it over 
the 19-foot-high wall in left leading off the seventh against John Cummings. 
</P>
<P>
 With some of his pitches clocked in the low 90s, Morris, 38, won for the first 
time since Aug. 17. He gave up five hits.

NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP; KLESKO FINDS INSTANT SUCCESS WITH BRAVES

<TEXT>
<P>
 Atlanta rookie left fielder Ryan Klesko, playing under a microscope because he 
is replacing released fan favorite Ron Gant, finished the Braves' opening 
series nine for 16, and the Braves finished a four-game sweep with a 10-8 
victory over the Padres on Thursday afternoon in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 Klesko singled twice and scored once, helping Atlanta rally from a 7-4 
deficit, then made way for Mike Kelly, who doubled in the 11th inning for his 
first major league hit and scored what proved to be the winning run on David 
Justice's single. 
</P>
<P>
 San Diego rallied from a 4-0 deficit, then blew a 7-4 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Klesko, who homered in his first two games, started the Braves' rally when he 
bunted leading off the eighth inning and later scored. 
</P>
<P>
 "Klesko said, 'Do you mind if I bunt?' " Atlanta Manager Bobby Cox said. "Any 
way to get on. Boom." 
</P>
<P>
 Philadelphia 13, Colorado 8 -- Mariano Duncan hit a go-ahead, three-run homer 
in a five-run seventh inning as the Phillies routed the Rockies' bullpen for 
the third game in a row in Denver. 
</P>
<P>
 Pinch-hitter Tony Longmire reached on an error, Lenny Dykstra singled off

BASEBALL / DAILY REPORT; DODGERS; DESHIELDS WON'T FORGET STRAWBERRY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 With Darryl Strawberry gone, Delino DeShields is the only African-American on 
the team, and DeShields says it is not a situation he is used to. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a problem for me, I'm more mature now, but it is unusual," DeShields 
said. "In Montreal, Marquis Grissom was my best friend and, well, sometimes 
it's good to have somebody that you can hang with. That doesn't mean that I 
can't hang with someone who isn't black, but most of the time, that's just the 
way it is." 
</P>
<P>
 DeShields, 25, said he and Strawberry got close during spring training, 
although he knew him a little before then. Their lockers were next to each 
other, both in Vero Beach, Fla., and in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't talked with Darryl, but I called and left a message for him at his 
house to let him know I'm here for him," DeShields said. "If he's listening to 
what everybody is saying on the news, he's going to think he's been abandoned. 
I just want him to know they are not speaking for me. He will be my friend 
regardless of what happens." 
</P>
<P>
 DeShields, wife Tisha and son Delino have rented a place in the South Bay. He 
says he hopes to be active in the Los Angeles community, as he was in Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
 "It takes time to establish relationships and your things to do in the 
community, and now it's kind of all down the drain, but then, it isn't," he 
said. "I was a kid when I first got to Montreal (when he was 21) and it took me 
some time to get comfortable with myself and in doing the things I wanted to do 
with kids because I felt like a kid myself -- I had no responsibilities. But 
now I have responsibilities, and there should be some things to do here in 
L.A." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Little by little, a cone of silence is falling over Dodger officials, who are 
finding it of little use to keep talking about Strawberry. Manager Tom Lasorda 
said Wednesday that he was finished talking, and Thursday, Executive Vice 
President Fred Claire basically said he's not going to talk unless there is a 
reason to. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Stawberry) doesn't need to be reading a new chapter every day, and I'm not 
going to contribute to a new chapter," Claire said.  
</P>
<P>
 Claire said he has not mapped out a timetable for a decision on Strawberry's 
future with the team. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Left fielder Henry Rodriguez, who hit two home runs and drove in all three 
runs in the Dodgers' 3-2 victory Wednesday night, said he watched highlights on 
television until 2:30 a.m., then watched repeats on ESPN in the morning. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was exciting watching myself on TV," he said. MARYANN HUDSON

<P>
 The UCLA men's volleyball tournament, which begins tonight at Pauley Pavilion, 
will feature four teams ranked among the top 14 in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 Fourth-ranked USC will play No. 14 Loyola Marymount at 5, and top-ranked UCLA 
will face sixth-ranked Cal State Northridge at 7. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA's semifinal against Northridge (14-8) is the only match in the tournament 
that will count as a Mountain Pacific Sports Federation match. The Bruins 
(20-1) are led by Jeff Nygaard, whose averages of 1.94 blocks and 7.11 kills a 
game rank him second and third, respectively, in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 The third-place match will be held at 5 Saturday, followed by the championship 
match at 7:30. WENDY WITHERSPOON

FIGURE SKATING; KWAN ADMIRES PROS, BUT STAYS A STEP AHEAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY HARVEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Like most of those who watched the women skate Thursday night at the Sports 
Arena in the Hershey's Kisses Pro-Am, Michelle Kwan went away impressed with 
the professionals. 
</P>
<P>
 "Caryn and Rosalynn are very artistic," she said. "The professionals, they 
skate beautifully." 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, neither Caryn Kadavy, the defending champion who upset Nancy Kerrigan 
in this event last year, nor Rosalynn Sumners could match Kwan jump for jump, 
which is the reason she has the lead after the two-minute technical programs. 
</P>
<P>
 In tonight's four-minute freestyle progams, however, the emphasis is on style, 
and both the second-place Kadavy and third-place Sumners are in position to win 
if Kwan falters. The freestyle programs count toward two-thirds of the final 
score. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel like I'm at the peak of my skating," said Kadavy, 26, who won 
first-place marks from all nine judges for presentation, including four 5.9s on 
a 6.0 scale. "This is my time." 
</P>
<P>
 Compared to Kwan, Kadavy, of Erie, Pa., was a slow starter. She did not even 
compete in her first senior national championship until she was 17. Kwan, of 
Torrance, was the silver medalist in this year's nationals at 13. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was that age, I was a novice who could do only one triple jump," 
Kadavy said. 
</P>
<P>
 But, she said, that might be the reason she continues to skate so well as a 
professional. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm worried about some of these younger girls who are getting their jumps 
before puberty," Kadavy said. "My bones and muscles were developed before I had 
mine. I'm worried some of these girls are getting their jumps too soon." 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Figure Skating Assn. officials are concerned that Kwan might be doing too 
much too soon, and her coach, Frank Carroll, said before Thursday night's 
competition that she is tired. She has been competing almost nonstop since last 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
 But, performing before a supportive crowd of 5,671, she seemed energetic, 
displaying none of the rough edges that plagued her technical program during 
the recent World Championships in Japan, where she finished eighth. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you want to think about something behind you, think about something good, 
not something that went wrong," said Kwan, who was awarded first-place scores 
from six of the nine judges. 
</P>
<P>
 That is good advice for former world champion Elaine Zayak to remember in 
tonight's freestyle program. After injuring her left knee in practice Thursday 
afternoon, she stumbled during a footwork sequence in her technical program and 
fell on the knee again. Standing fifth, she will decide after a practice today 
whether she will compete tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never had something like that happen to me," she said of her fall. "I 
was shocked." 
</P>
<P>
 In the men's technical program Thursday night, Paul Wylie, the 1992 Olympic 
silver-medalist, finished first, just ahead of two-time national champion Scott 
Davis. 
</P>
<P>
 Reigning national champions had difficulties in the other competitions as 
well. Dance champions Elizabeth Punsalan and Jerod Swallow are in second place 
behind Renee Roca and Gorsha Sur, and pairs champions Jenni Meno and Todd Sand 
are in second place behind Kyoko Ina and Jasen Dungjen.

THOROUGHBRED RACING; VALIANT NATURE PULLED OUT OF SATURDAY'S RACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL CHRISTINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A press aide from Santa Anita arrived at trainer Ron McAnally's barn office 
Thursday morning, plopped two shopping bags on the floor and left. 
</P>
<P>
 They contained 10 to 15 sets of caps, sweat shirts and pin-on lapel badges, 
all with Valiant Nature's name and caricature on them. 
</P>
<P>
 McAnally looked at the assortment and shrugged. He was standing with a group 
of reporters, explaining why Valiant Nature would skip Saturday's Santa Anita 
Derby to run in another $500,000 Kentucky Derby prep, the Blue Grass Stakes at 
Keeneland on April 16. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Anita will still have the strongest field of 3-year-olds for a race this 
year, but Valiant Nature would have made the 1 1/8-mile stake even better, and 
the smiles in the track's executive suite weren't quite as wide. "I just wish 
we had known about this a few days ago," said Mark Stephens, Santa Anita's 
director of marketing. 
</P>
<P>
 The track's pre-race hype has focused on three horses -- Valiant Nature, 
Brocco and Tabasco Cat -- and as late as Thursday, Santa Anita was running 
full-page newspaper ads that included a zany drawing of Valiant Nature, dressed 
up like Sherlock Holmes with a magnifying glass sticking out of one hoof. 
</P>
<P>
 McAnally said the decision to ship Valiant Nature to Keeneland wasn't made 
until Wednesday night, after options were discussed with Verne Winchell, who 
bred and owns the colt, and David Fiske, general manager of Winchell's Oakwind 
Farm near Lexington, Ky. 
</P>
<P>
 NcAnally said Winchell had left the decision up to the trainer. "We decided 
that it would be good to get the horse back to Kentucky ahead of time," 
McAnally said. "We're thinking of the horse more than anything else. It's 
what's good for the horse that matters, and he'll have extra time back there 
and the chance to get acclimated. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to emphasize that we're not ducking anybody. We're not afraid of 
Brocco. We've got a legitimate (Kentucky) Derby horse and he's of the caliber 
that he could have won either one of these races. The field here has a lot of 
depth, but we'll be meeting another Derby favorite (Holy Bull) at Keeneland, 
and he's got as much speed as my horse. I think my horse would have been the 
second choice, no matter where he ran." 
</P>
<P>
 When the nine-horse Santa Anita Derby field was drawn Thursday, Brocco was 
installed as the 7-5 favorite. 
</P>
<P>
 The Breeders' Cup Juvenile winner was beaten by Valiant Nature in the 
Hollywood Futurity, then after a three-month layoff, they had an extended duel 
in the San Felipe Stakes three weeks ago. Soul Of The Matter went by both of 
them in the last sixteenth of a mile, with Brocco beating Valiant Nature by a 
head for second place. McAnally said Valiant Nature had been wrung out after 
the race, but a 1:13 3/5 six-furlong workout Sunday convinced the trainer that 
the full brother to 1991 grass champion Tight Spot was back on his game. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Tufts, the Santa Anita linemaker, said he might have made Valiant Nature 
the co-second choice, with Tabasco Cat, depending on post positions. As it is, 
Tabasco Cat is 5-2, followed by Soul Of The Matter at 3-1. 
</P>
<P>
 Trainer Bobby Frankel said it was probable that Wild Invader would be 
scratched, to wait for the Wood Memorial at Aqueduct on April 16. All of 
Saturday's starters will carry 122 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Fiske, the possibility of running Valiant Nature in the Blue 
Grass came up about 10 days ago. "The size of the fields was a factor," 
Winchell's farm manager said. "The Blue Grass is going to be a potentially 
smaller field than the Santa Anita race. And if you had the choice of running 
against one top horse or four top horses, why wouldn't you run against only the 
one top horse? We're trying to get to Churchill Downs (for the May 7 Kentucky 
Derby) with a full tank of gas. We don't want to burn up this horse too fast." 
</P>
<P>
 More important than his impact on Santa Anita's marketing plans, Valiant 
Nature, through his absence, could change the race's riding tactics. Doug 
Peterson, who trains the speed-crazy Fly'n J. Bryan, is ecstatic that Valiant 
Nature won't run. "It's good news," Peterson said. "My horse should get a 
better trip and should be able to relax more." 
</P>
<P>
 Not so happy is Randy Winick, Brocco's trainer, who would prefer that his colt 
not battle for the early lead. "This changes the complexion of the race," 
Winick said. "Valiant Nature and Fly'n J. Bryan figured to contest the lead. My 
colt has speed, too, but we'd just as soon be laying off the pace." 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Stevens, Brocco's jockey and a three-time winner of the Santa Anita 
Derby, doesn't think that Fly'n J. Bryan will be allowed to ramble along by 
himself on the front end. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've ridden Pollock's Luck," Stevens said, "and from the No. 1 post, I think 
they'll have to go with him. Even Tabasco Cat might be up there early."

COLLEGE BASEBALL / GARY KLEIN; LIONS' 'SULTAN' EXULTS AFTER EARLY FAILURES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GARY KLEIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The cover of the 1994 Loyola Marymount baseball media guide features a photo 
of three uniformed Lion players standing on the beach with turbans on their 
heads. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the so-called "Sultans of Swing" is junior outfielder Mike Peters, an 
improbable all-conference performer who after years of being cut during high 
school and college tryouts is cutting down opposing pitchers with regularity. 
</P>
<P>
 "My parents told me that if you like something, you should never quit trying," 
said Peters, who is batting .333 with six home runs and 26 runs batted in. 
"There have definitely been times when I didn't think I would get a chance. But 
it just goes to show you what can happen if you stick with it." 
</P>
<P>
 Peters, 6 feet 3 and 185 pounds, was cut in his freshman and sophomore years 
at Loyola High and said coaches discouraged him from trying out again as a 
senior. 
</P>
<P>
 During his freshman year at Loyola Marymount, however, he decided to give 
baseball another try. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a one-day tryout, and I didn't do real well," Peters recalled. "We hit 
in the (batting) cages, I took two ground balls at shortstop and I threw about 
three balls in from the outfield. That was it. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I got cut, I was pretty discouraged." 
</P>
<P>
 When Jody Robinson replaced Chris Smith as coach at Loyola Marymount after the 
1991 season, many players left for other programs. Peters, meanwhile, showed up 
for tryouts again. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wasn't getting too warm of a response, but at least I was out there for a 
week," Peters said. "I was kind of at the bottom of the barrel. (Robinson) just 
told me to go to the outfield and shag fly balls." 
</P>
<P>
 Recalled Robinson: "When you get a guy like that, you usually stick him in the 
bullpen as a catcher and pretty much forget about him because he's just happy 
to be there. But Mike didn't want any part of that, and given our situation, we 
weren't in a position to turn a guy like that completely away." 
</P>
<P>
 Peters was used primarily as a late-inning defensive replacement in 1992 and 
got two hits in six at-bats. After the season, he played regularly in a 
collegiate summer league and returned to Loyola last season as a challenger for 
a starting position. 
</P>
<P>
 "Coach told me it was between me and another guy in center field," Peters 
said. "When you wait as long as I had for a chance like that, you don't want to 
be the other guy." 
</P>
<P>
 Peters won the job and went on to hit .365 with seven homers and 36 RBIs. He 
batted .396 in West Coast Conference games and led the league with 76 hits. 
</P>
<P>
 This season, Peters is trying to help Loyola win at least a share of the 
conference title. The Lions enter this weekend's series at St. Mary's 16-20 
overall and 5-7 in the WCC, three games behind first-place Santa Clara. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wouldn't say that getting cut all those times was the best thing that ever 
happened to me," Peters said. "But it does make you battle, and I think that's 
one of the things I do best." 
</P>

<P>
 Trivia time: What pitcher ended Robin Ventura's NCAA-record 58-game hitting 
streak after Jack McDowell had held Ventura hitless in his first four at-bats 
of a 1987 College World Series game? 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Big West battle: One of the biggest local series of the year begins tonight at 
Blair Field in Long Beach, where Cal State Fullerton (26-6), ranked No. 1 by 
Collegiate Baseball, will play seventh-ranked Long Beach State (22-7). 
</P>
<P>
 Last season, Long Beach swept Fullerton for the first time in a series that 
was marred by a violent, bench-clearing brawl in the opener. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton or Long Beach has advanced to the College World Series in each of 
the last six years, and both could well wind up at Omaha again this season. But 
the outcome of this weekend's three-game series might not even determine first 
place in the Big West Conference. 
</P>
<P>
 Pacific, yes Pacific, has ridden a nation-leading 22-game winning streak to 
the top of the conference standings. It is 27-6 overall and 3-0 in the Big 
West. Fullerton (5-1) is second and Long Beach (4-2) and UC Santa Barbara (4-2) 
third. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tigers, under fifth-year Coach Quincey Noble, are ranked 26th -- the first 
time Pacific's baseball team has received a national ranking. And although 
Pacific's preconference schedule was nowhere near as difficult as those of 
Southland Division I teams, the school is only eight victories shy of achieving 
its best season. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Pac-10 showdown: First place in the Pacific 10 Conference Southern Division 
will be on the line starting tonight when sixth-ranked USC (27-8) plays host to 
ninth-ranked Stanford (21-13). 
</P>
<P>
 The Trojans took two of three games from the Cardinal at Palo Alto last month 
and are in first place in the division, 1 1/2 games ahead of Stanford and 
Arizona State, which visits USC next weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 USC is coming off a sweep at Arizona. Seven hitters are over .300, led by 
Aaron Boone, who is batting .366 and has stolen 22 bases, two short of the 
school single-season record set by Don Buford Jr. in 1987. Freshman Randy 
Flores is 5-0 with a 1.25 earned-run average for a staff that has a 3.01 ERA 
and has yielded only nine homers. 
</P>
<P>
 Trojan Coach Mike Gillespie said pitching and defense have helped his team win 
18 of its last 21 games.

BASEBALL / DOLE BIG WEST TOURNAMENT; MARINA STEPS UP BY BEATING LAKEWOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS FOSTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Marina's baseball team, at a standstill in the early part of the season, gave 
itself a little shove heading back into Sunset League play. 
</P>
<P>
 The Vikings completed a four-game run through the Dole Big West Tournament 
with a 6-5 victory over Lakewood in the championship game Thursday night at 
Windrow Park. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to be fine," Marina catcher Craig Wilson said. "This is just what 
we needed." 
</P>
<P>
 The Vikings (13-5) lost their last league game in the final inning to Edison, 
dropping their league record to 2-2, but they seem to have put that behind 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory over Lakewood was particularly satisfying, as Eric Turner pitched 
out of a two-on, one-out jam in the seventh to earn the save. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was a shot in the arm because we had lost in the last inning to Edison," 
Coach Paul Renfrow said. "It was the type of game we needed." 
</P>
<P>
 The Vikings got a lot things they needed, including a solid performance from 
Brian Sailor, their top pitcher last season.  
</P>
<P>
 Sailor was 5-2 in 1993, but has pitched in only one game this season because 
of an arm injury. Sailor (1-0) wobbled at times, giving up five hits and 
walking two in four innings. But was effective overall. He struck out seven and 
gave up four runs -- one was unearned and two others scored on a bad-hop 
single. 
</P>
<P>
 "To get 95 pitches out of Brian was tremendous," Renfrow said. "He'll be able 
to give us some good outings when we get back into league." 
</P>
<P>
 Turner, who was called up from the junior varsity for the tournament, relieved 
Sailor in the fifth and waded through the Lakewood lineup. He made only one 
mistake, a 1-1 fastball that Luke Fitzpatrick hit over the right-field fence. 
</P>
<P>
 Marina scored five runs in the bottom of the first inning. The Vikings sent 10 
men to the plate, as Lakewood's Tony Martin struggled. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin walked two batters and hit two in the inning. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson got it started with a run-scoring single -- his 10th RBI of the 
tournament. A second run scored when left fielder Eric Holguin misplayed the 
ball. 
</P>
<P>
 Nate Newton and Sailor had RBI doubles in the inning. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin, the Lancers' No. 4 starter, was gone after the second inning. Ryan 
Bresnahan relieved and got control of the game. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lancers chipped away at the Marina lead, with a little luck and a little 
help. 
</P>
<P>
 The Vikings made two errors in the second, which led to an unearned run. The 
Lancers got three runs in the third, two when Steve Immel's ground ball took a 
funny hop over the shoulder of shortstop Mike Groh. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Lancers also wasted plenty of opportunities. They stranded 10 runners. 
Lakewood left the bases loaded in the second. 
</P>
<P>
 Bresnahan, who pitched three hitless innings, appeared to tire in the sixth. 
He gave up two hits -- sandwiched around a wild pitch -- including an RBI 
single by Groh. 
</P>
<P>
 In the consolation final: 
</P>
<P>
 Ocean View 9, Long Beach Millikan 0 -- Sophomore Cory Carr pitched a four-hit 
shutout, striking out three for the Seahawks (8-6). 
</P>
<P>
 Also for Ocean View, Jack Fresca had two doubles and three RBIs and Kevin 
Johnson had two hits and one RBI. 
</P>
<P>
 In the third-place game: 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine 7, Servite 2 -- The Vaqueros scored three runs in the sixth inning to 
take a 6-1 lead. Eric Sobek homered, Geoff Noisy tripled, David Hongslo doubled 
and Charlie Heath pitched a six-hitter for Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 In a consolation game: 
</P>
<P>
 Capistrano Valley 4, Woodbridge 2 -- Paul Day pitched a complete game for the 
Cougars (10-5). Day (2-0) struck out four and did not allow a walk and Gabe 
Payne was two for three with one RBI for the Cougars. Woodbridge is 6-10.

WESTERN'S HUMPHRIES PUTS A STOP TO ALISO NIGUEL OFFENSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN HENDERSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Aliso Niguel could have made a statement Tuesday with a victory over Western. 
Instead, Stacy Humphries let her pitching do the talking, silencing Aliso 
Niguel's bats in a 6-2 nonleague victory at Dana Hills High. 
</P>
<P>
 It was an unusual site for the Wolverines' first home game, but typical of 
this season for the team without a field. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, entering the week, Aliso Niguel led the county in batting (.359) and 
had scored 30 more runs than its closest competition. 
</P>
<P>
 So, how do you explain having five batters with .380 averages or better? 
Scheduling. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think we would be batting as high if we played tougher teams," said 
Stefanie Ruiz, who is batting .511 with 29 runs batted in, "but as long as we 
have a little confidence, I think it will be easier to step up next year 
against better competition." 
</P>
<P>
 Western, which has lost four times to teams that have appeared in the top 10, 
improved to 8-6; Aliso Niguel dropped to 8-9. 
</P>
<P>
 None of that mattered to Humphries. She faced only two batters over the 
minimum, excluding the fourth inning, in which Aliso Niguel scored twice on two 
errors and singles by Candice Heath, Ruiz and Allison Batten. The Wolverines 
would have had more if not for an interference call that ended the inning on 
Kirsten Roy's single with runners at second and third. 
</P>
<P>
 Western got two hits each from Humphries and Brandy Baker, and RBIs from 
Adrienne Ratajczak, Amber Rose, Jaime Jones and Jodie Thibodeaux. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pioneers scored twice in first, second and sixth innings.

COLLEGE DIVISION NOTEBOOK / MARTIN BECK: FATHER, DAUGHTER MAKE GOOD TEAM AT 
CHAPMAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN BECK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Chapman's Lisle Lloyd didn't plan to become one of the winningest college 
softball coaches in the nation. In fact, he never set out to be a softball 
coach at all. 
</P>
<P>
 It all started in the late 1960s as a way to spend more time with his daughter 
Janet. She had started playing in the Tustin Bobby Sox League and Lloyd, 
noticing a scarcity of good coaching, decided that despite his lack of 
experience he could do better. 
</P>
<P>
 When Janet moved on to Tustin High, Lloyd continued coaching Bobby Sox for 
several years. After Janet graduated from Tustin in 1978, he became the coach 
at Foothill High, and a year later he moved over to Tustin and led the Tillers 
to three consecutive league titles. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1983, Chapman needed a softball coach and Lloyd took over. 
</P>
<P>
 Long before then, he had been hooked by this part-time career. His primary 
business was a service station he owned in Orange, but his heart was on the 
field. 
</P>
<P>
 "It got to where it started interfering with my softball, so I sold it," Lloyd 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Lloyd's second season at Chapman, Janet transferred from Cal State 
Fullerton. She had led the nation in home runs and had been an All-American for 
the Titans but transferred after knee surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 Lloyd didn't have an assistant coach, so with Janet as a player-coach, the 
Panthers finished 45-29-1 and advanced to the NCAA regionals before losing to 
UC Riverside and Cal State Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 The next year, Lloyd hired Janet as an assistant. Now more than a decade 
later, Lloyd, 71, is the dean of the Chapman coaching staff. 
</P>
<P>
 Lloyd, who coached one season at Christ College Irvine (now Concordia 
University) in 1989, was 344-267-2 before this season, putting him eighth on 
the NCAA victory list for active Division II coaches. 
</P>
<P>
 Since returning to Chapman, he has had to adjust with the program, taking it 
from a team that had most of its players on athletic scholarships to one 
without athletic scholarships today. In 1991 during the transition, the 
Panthers were the top-ranked Division II team in the nation for part of the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 Janet, still an assistant, has taken over many of the day-to-day 
responsibilities. She teaches the fundamentals and plans and runs the 
practices. Lisle coaches third base and handles the recruiting -- his 
specialty. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would have to say he's the best recruiter I've ever seen," Janet said. 
"People are amazed that we get the kind of athletes we get with no scholarship 
money at a $24,000 school." 
</P>
<P>
 Janet says the father-daughter coaching team helps build a family atmosphere 
for the Panthers. When she and Lisle argue, she has heard players say, 'It's 
just like me and my dad." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Janet: "We have our little spats here and there, but he's the man. He's a 
71-year-old man who has his ways set but he knows how to get victories." 
</P>
<P>
 Lloyd, who played football and ran track at Newport Harbor High before 
graduating in 1940, said he plans to keep coaching several more years. He hopes 
to reach some coaching milestones along the way. With at least 11 games left 
this season, he is 34 victories short of 400. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Lloyds have been surprised at how well this year's team has played. The 
Panthers are 22-11 entering the UC San Diego tournament today through Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 But they are chomping at the bit about next season, which will be the 
Panthers' first as an NCAA Division III independent. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's definitely where we belong because without scholarships you can't 
compete against Bakersfield and the other big schools," Lisle said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to be very strong next year. I haven't said this to anyone yet, 
but I will be really surprised if we don't win the national championship. I 
really think we have the team to do it." 
</P>

 Concordia's LaSondra Kellum was named the NAIA District 3 softball player of 
the week after batting .500 in two games. Kellum, a junior catcher from Carson, 
was four for eight with a home run, six runs batted in and two runs scored as 
the Eagles split a doubleheader with San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 Southern California College remains in first place in the Golden State 
Athletic Conference softball race. The Vanguards (28-6, 6-1), who are ranked 
10th in the latest NAIA national poll, play on Saturday at Point Loma Nazarene. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Concordia (12-19-1, 3-5) could get back into the GSAC baseball race with a 
doubleheader sweep at home Saturday, but the Eagles are facing one of the 
conference's strongest teams, Point Loma Nazarene (22-8, 4-3), which is ranked 
sixth in the NAIA. 
</P>
<P>
 The Point Loma program has been bolstered by the hiring of former Eagles' 
Coach Scott Sarver as associate coach. Sarver moved to Point Loma last season 
and helped it advance to the NAIA World Series where the Crusaders finished 
third. 
</P>
<P>
 Southern California College (11-21, 1-7) plays at Azusa Pacific.

CERVANTES AGAIN SHOULDERING LOAD FOR SYLMAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAIGE A. LEECH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Senior right-hander Mario Cervantes hadn't had a pitching start in more than a 
month. But, despite the layoff due to shoulder problems, Sylmar High's 
right-hander showed Thursday that he hasn't lost his stuff. 
</P>
<P>
 Cervantes allowed only two hits in five innings to fuel Sylmar's 7-1 victory 
over Monroe in a Valley Pac-8 Conference game. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the 13th victory in 14 games for Sylmar (13-3, 4-0 in league play), The 
Times' fourth-ranked team in the region. 
</P>
<P>
 "We played pretty solid," Sylmar Coach Gary Donatella said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only thing I'm not happy with is the defense. We're still kicking balls 
around. But the guys have a good feeling about themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 Cervantes (3-0) gave up hits to only Evan Lovett in the third and David Lusk 
in the fourth. Michael Perez, who reached base on an error, scored Monroe's run 
on Lusk's one-out single. 
</P>
<P>
 By then, however, the Spartans were enjoying a 5-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Sylmar sent 10 batters to the plate in the third and scored four runs on four 
hits, including home runs by Hiram Damwijk and Jose Palacios. 
</P>
<P>
 After Carlos Velazco singled to drive in Cervantes for a 2-0 Sylmar lead, 
Damwijk followed with a long fly to center field. Center fielder Alfredo Aleman 
took a couple of steps in before realizing the ball was going well over his 
head. The ball rolled to the wall -- about 450 feet away -- and Damwijk cruised 
home for his second inside-the-park home run. 
</P>
<P>
 Two batters later Palacios, who doubled in his first at-bat, ripped a towering 
shot over a 30-foot fence 320 feet away in left field to give the Spartans a 
5-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Sylmar added two runs in the seventh on a run-scoring double by Cervantes and 
a fielding error. 
</P>
<P>
 Monroe (3-6, 2-2), which managed just six hits in two games this week against 
Sylmar, continues to struggle. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got to have some guys step up as leaders," Monroe Coach Kevin Campbell 
said, "and nobody is doing it."  
</P>
<P>
 That isn't all. Ace pitcher Joel Zamudio, who took himself out of Tuesday's 
game in the third inning against Sylmar because of shoulder pain, is scheduled 
to see a specialist next week. 
</P>
<P>
 Sylmar's Steve Zamora allowed only one hit in two innings of relief, retiring 
six of the seven batters he faced.

MANDELL GOOD ENOUGH FOR GRANADA HILLS; BASEBALL: SENIOR LOSES NO-HITTER IN 
SIXTH, BUT AIDED BY THREE HOME RUNS, HE HOLDS ON FOR 10-4 VICTORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Granada Hills High pitcher Marc Mandell stood on the brink of making school 
history Thursday against Taft, but he faltered. 
</P>
<P>
 Mandell did not give up a hit in the first 5 1/3 innings and the Highlanders 
jumped to a nine-run lead, but when he came off the mound after allowing four 
hits and four runs in the sixth, Coach Darryl Stroh yelled at him. 
</P>
<P>
 Stroh was angry that Mandell had blown his chance for a no-hitter and breaking 
the school record for fewest number of pitches in a seven-inning game (61, set 
by Bob Jones in 1977, according to Stroh). 
</P>
<P>
 By the time Mandell finished a 10-4 victory at Granada Hills, Stroh had 
calmed, but the missed opportunity still gnawed at him. 
</P>
<P>
 "The kid is pitching a great ballgame: He has a no-hitter, he's 15 pitches 
away from breaking the record -- he has a couple of really neat things going 
for him," Stroh said. "It ticked me off a little bit, because you don't get in 
that position very often." 
</P>
<P>
 In the sixth inning, Mandell (2-0) surrendered four hits, four runs and his 
chances at two marks of distinction. He did, however, complete the game in 73 
pitches by retiring the side in order in the seventh. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had that one bad inning," Mandell said. "My main problem was that I kept 
getting the ball up." 
</P>
<P>
 Other than that brief stretch, the senior was outstanding. He allowed only 
those four hits, walked one and struck out three. 
</P>
<P>
 And he excused his coach's outburst. "(Stroh) wasn't really mad at me," 
Mandell said. "It's just that you rarely get a chance to do something like 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 Not quite as infrequent but an equally welcome sight for Granada Hills (6-2, 
2-1 in Northwest Valley Conference play) was its power display. The Highlanders 
clubbed three home runs, including one by right fielder Adrian Torres, who 
belted a three-run shot over the right field fence to open the scoring in the 
third inning. 
</P>
<P>
 Granada Hills added two runs in the fourth and four in the fifth, including a 
deep home run by Jimmy Landress. Jim O'Brien homered in the sixth inning. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Brien, Landress, Eddie Kinsler and Bryan Weinstein each went two for three 
for Granada Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Chad Marriner of Taft (7-7, 2-1) hit a two-run double in the sixth.

CSU CAMPUS PLANNERS GET LOCAL INPUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOANNA M. MILLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Area residents and community leaders on Thursday told planners of a new Cal 
State Ventura County campus that they would like a college with minimal 
traffic, hidden or underground parking lots and possibly a football stadium to 
be shared with other schools. 
</P>
<P>
 The campus should also be designed so that agriculture in the surrounding area 
is preserved, said one resident attending a meeting at the County Government 
Center in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 Some in the audience of about 50 people worried that the campus would create 
too much pressure to develop commercial businesses or apartments on surrounding 
land designated as the greenbelt buffer zone between the cities of Oxnard and 
Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have talked with nearby landowners who are thinking about building 
apartments to service the university," said Larry Rose, who represented Brokaw 
Nursery in Saticoy. "I encourage the university to think more deeply about 
maintaining the agriculture integrity of the area." 
</P>
<P>
 But letters read by representatives from elected officials welcomed the 
university and cautioned the community to push ahead to build the campus that 
has been decades in coming to the county. 
</P>
<P>
 "The community must continue working together, be diligent in their support 
and never lose sight of the vision of a four-year university in this county," 
said Sen. Gary K. Hart (D-Santa Barbara) in a letter read by his 
representative. Hart sponsored the legislation that set aside the first $7 
million to buy property for a university. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday's meeting, called to hear community concerns and desires for the 
campus, was the first in a series planned over the next several years while a 
university is being developed in what is now a lemon orchard west of Camarillo. 
No further dates for community meetings have yet been set, but planners assured 
residents that all their opinions will be considered. 
</P>
<P>
 The first Cal State site in Ventura County was purchased in the 1960s in the 
Somis area, but was sold off in the early 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
 The present site was selected in 1991, after a seven-year battle to find a 
location in Ventura County that was suitable and politically acceptable to 
nearby residents and elected officials. 
</P>
<P>
 During that time, the state economy turned sour and Cal State operating and 
maintenance budgets were cut, leaving little funding for such capital projects 
as new campuses. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, one of the two property owners has refused to sell his land. But 
the university is moving slowly forward and has filed to take the property by 
eminent domain. Cal State officials said they hope to have some resolution 
within the next three months, but the process could drag on for years. 
</P>
<P>
 But the state, with its deep financial troubles, will have to look to the 
private sector more than ever to help make the 23rd campus in the Cal State 
system a reality, said Chancellor Barry Munitz. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will have to have public-private partnerships, not just in donations of 
money, but in services, equipment, time (and) expertise," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Munitz said he does not want the new campus to be limited by design ideas used 
in building existing campuses. 
</P>
<P>
 "We met with the master planning architects and we told them over and over 
again to stretch our minds and don't be traditional and don't be conservative," 
Munitz said. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, Jean Marie Gath, the lead architect with the firm Hardy Holzman 
Pfeiffer Associates, told residents the new campus will have the kind of 
advanced technology that will allow "distance learning," in which the 
instructor is in one location and the students in another. 
</P>
<P>
 But the campus will also be a social center, she said, with enough open space 
for students to gather. She said the university may use public transportation, 
or electric cars to cut down on the traffic to the campus. 
</P>
<P>
 The university may also build housing on campus to accommodate not just 
students but faculty and staff as well. 
</P>
<P>
 William Lawson, dean of continuing education at Oxnard College, said a sports 
stadium is needed at the university as well as by other colleges in the 
community. 
</P>
<P>
 David Leveille, director of institutional relations for the university, said a 
stadium would generate heavy traffic. But a stadium, like a theater, is the 
kind of public-private partnership the university wants to pursue. 
</P>
<P>
 John Rush, president of the Las Posas Property Owners Assn., said the campus 
entrance should be along Santa Clara Avenue to keep student traffic out of his 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 But planners said there would probably be a main entrance along Central 
Avenue, between two tall wind rows of eucalyptus trees, to give students "a 
sense of arrival." 
</P>
<P>
 Others, like Norma Lagomarsino, were concerned that vast paved areas for 
parking would ruin the appearance of the campus. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's important that the parking lots look nice with landscaping so that the 
college doesn't look like a shopping mall," said Lagomarsino, whose husband, 
former Rep. Bob Lagomarsino, also attended the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Gath assured Lagomarsino and others that parking lots would probably be spread 
out in small areas and would be obscured by trees and other landscaping. 
</P>
<P>
 But underground parking is not being considered, because it is prohibitively 
expensive at $22,000 per space, compared to about $1,000 per space for regular 
parking, Gath said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Were it not for the $22,000 cost per parking space, it would be nice to bury 
the parking lots and this campus and farm over the top of it," joked Rose of 
the Brokaw Nursery. FYI

GOING UNDER?; TEACHER'S CLASSROOM HYPNOSIS PROVOKES TRUSTEES' ANXIETY 
</P>

 Once a semester, Lynn Meschan puts her psychology students into a trance. 
</P>
<P>
 Hypnosis "creates an altered state that's natural, where that person himself 
is in charge," said Meschan, who teaches at Moorpark and Ventura colleges. 
"What students are learning is that they can create for themselves a wonderful, 
relaxed, peaceful state of mind."  
</P>
<P>
 But what Meschan calls wonderful and peaceful, some Ventura County Community 
College District trustees worry may be inappropriate and legally indefensible. 
</P>
<P>
 Eighteen years after Meschan began using hypnosis in her introductory 
psychology classes, at least three of the five trustees say she may have to 
snap out of it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hypnosis may have usefulness, but I'm not familiar with it," said Karen 
Boone, the trustee who initiated an investigation of the practice. "I even have 
a psychology minor from a four-year institution, and I've never encountered 
that."  
</P>
<P>
 Boone said she grew concerned with the practice about two years ago. At that 
time, she said, two students approached her separately, saying frightening 
dreams -- which they attributed to the 15-minute hypnosis sessions -- plagued 
them with unnerving frequency. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want anyone having a negative experience at the colleges," Boone 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, the district chancellor, college presidents, other teachers and 
administrators, Meschan and even her psychology students have entered the 
alternative-consciousness fray. 
</P>
<P>
 Meschan -- who is considered extremely popular with her students for her 
innovative methods -- teaches three introductory psychology classes each 
semester at Moorpark College and one each semester at Ventura College. 
</P>
<P>
 Students at both colleges have defended the practice in writing, some saying 
it was one of the most memorable lessons of the semester. Meschan has made her 
case before department heads and both college presidents and won assurance that 
she would be allowed to continue her hypnosis sessions, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Then the district's lawyer weighed in. The college district, he said, could be 
setting itself up for a lawsuit every time Meschan asks her students to close 
their eyes and concentrate on her voice. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawyer's opinion gave pause to Trustee Gregory P. Cole. "I'm alarmed 
because of the potential liability," he said. "What happens if . . . someone 
claims he was damaged mentally or physically by this?" 
</P>
<P>
 Board President Allan Jacobs said the attorney's letter also made him wary. 
"It isn't that I'm opposed to hypnosis -- personally, I feel it's helpful to a 
number of people," he said, adding that he has never been hypnotized. 
</P>
<P>
 "But there may be long-lasting effects which we don't know about," he 
continued, "and with the litigious society we have around us, we don't need 
anything more to bother us." 
</P>
<P>
 Board members will consider the issue at next month's meeting. Meanwhile, the 
college presidents are gathering information on whether teachers at other 
college districts permit hypnosis in class. 
</P>
<P>
 For their part, Meschan's students view the whole to-do as evidence of an 
unenlightened board of trustees. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was relaxing and rather harmless," said Chris Dellith, 28, of Agoura. 
"Look, she can describe it to you or she can help you experience it. What's 
better, a description or the actual experience?" 
</P>
<P>
 Mami Sakamoto, 20, of Moorpark didn't participate in the hypnosis session, 
although most of her class did, because she was a little afraid of what might 
happen. She remembered watching a hypnosis demonstration on television in which 
the hypnotist made people do a crazy dance, she said. Sakamoto did not feel 
like dancing. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, after watching the session in early February, she said she wishes she had 
been part of it. "It looks like fun," she said with a giggle. 
</P>
<P>
 This, Meschan said, is what she does: She spends about five minutes or so 
helping the students relax their bodies, encouraging them to visualize a 
peaceful, natural setting and to feel safe and comfortable. They are encouraged 
to feel each limb growing heavier, as if releasing all the tension that usually 
prevents an arm or leg from hanging limp. 
</P>
<P>
 Then she gives them suggestions on positive study habits and effective 
test-taking, on the assumption that in a hypnotic state, their subconscious 
mind will be more receptive to the information. She is then quiet for a minute, 
asking them to silently review their personal study goals. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, she counts to 5 and they return to their normal, conscious state. 
</P>
<P>
 Meschan, who is certified in hypnosis by the Psychodynamic School of Hypnosis 
in Northern California, emphasizes that students are not pressured into 
participating and that no one in a hypnotic state can be persuaded to do 
something he or she does not want to do. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you feel comfortable clucking like a chicken, you will cluck like a 
chicken," she said. "But if you don't feel comfortable, you won't."

NEW SCHOOL WITH FOCUS ON BASICS IS YEAR OFF; EDUCATION: EFFORTS TO DESIGN A 
PROGRAM AND SELECT A CAMPUS IN VENTURA WILL DELAY THE PROGRAM'S START.

 Despite earlier plans to open a back-to-basics elementary school in Ventura 
this fall, officials have announced that they will probably not be able to 
launch the planned school until the 1995-96 school year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think it's a real good possibility" that the school will be up and 
running this year, Assistant Supt. Gerald Dannenberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the biggest hurdles facing Ventura Unified School District officials is 
to survey parents and teachers throughout the district and decide which of 
their 17 elementary schools to convert to the back-to-basics format, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't have the luxury of a school site that's sitting unused to start a 
new program," Dannenberg said. "We're going to have to work around an existing 
school site." 
</P>
<P>
 Some parents who said they had been considering enrolling their children in 
the back-to-basics school for the fall said they were disappointed to hear 
about the delay. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's discouraging," said Margaret Kappel, who has a son in first grade at 
Pierpont School and a daughter in sixth grade at Cabrillo Middle School. "We do 
need as a society to get back to our basics as far as our values," she said. 
"We need to address some issues now." 
</P>
<P>
 Although she is pleased with both Pierpont and Cabrillo, Kappel said she may 
decide to enroll her son in the back-to-basics school. She likes the idea 
proposed by Supt. Joseph Spirito that parents at the back-to-basics school 
would be required to volunteer a certain number of hours each week. 
</P>
<P>
 "Parents need to get more involved," Kappel said. "You'd have parents and 
teachers and the whole administration system working toward the same goals." 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, however, Kappel said she is not surprised that it is taking 
longer than expected to establish the new school because of the amount of 
planning that is necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 A committee of 21 parents, community members, teachers and other school 
district staff has so far held two meetings to plan the new school. 
</P>
<P>
 And this week the group visited a school in Camarillo that has a format 
similar to that envisioned for the one in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 As proposed by Spirito, the Ventura back-to-basics school would have a tough 
dress code, strict discipline, strong parental involvement and a focus on 
traditional teaching methods in the classroom. It would have open enrollment 
for students from throughout the district. 
</P>
<P>
 But committee members said they are still trying to determine what type of 
academic programs and disciplinary rules they want at the new school. 
</P>
<P>
 Dan Munday, the principal of Poinsettia School who has been chosen to head the 
back-to-basics school when it opens, said one of the committee's concerns is 
how to ensure the new school is open to students from throughout the district. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to make sure there's equal access," Munday said. 
</P>
<P>
 The only existing magnet school in Ventura, Mound School, has come under fire 
for being elitist and inaccessible to the district's Latino students. Last 
year, the Office for Civil Rights of the U.S. Dept. of Education required the 
district to find ways to boost Latino enrollment at Mound. 
</P>
<P>
 Once the back-to-basics school committee settles on the academic programs and 
enrollment policies at the new school, the group will present its plan to the 
public, Munday said. 
</P>
<P>
 The next step will be to survey the community to decide which elementary 
school should convert to the back-to-basics format, which committee members 
hope to do this spring or in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
 And this decision promises to be the most difficult because while some parents 
and teachers may want their neighborhood school to change, others may not, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a lot of roadblocks to conquer yet, the main one being where it's 
going to be," said Janice Girouard, a Buena High teacher who is on the 
committee.

GOOD SENSE OF DIRECTION; MULTITALENTED STUDENT OVERSEES SCHOOL PRODUCTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAIA DAVIS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 During a recent rehearsal for the musical "Fiddler on the Roof," abouteight 
members of the Channel Islands High School cast were practicing the scene where 
villagers learn about "a new arrival" at one of their neighbor's homes. 
</P>
<P>
 But something was wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 The students' voices were listless, their arms hung clumsily by their sides: 
They did not look like the happy villagers they were supposed to be. 
</P>
<P>
 Seeing the problem, 17-year-old Tino Preciado jumped up from his seat to 
intervene. 
</P>
<P>
 "Picture this," he said to his classmates. "You're on a street. You know 
everyone in the town. And Motel and Tzeitel have just had a baby. It's got to 
be lively!" 
</P>
<P>
 And so it became. 
</P>
<P>
 After Tino sat down, the actors began the scene again. This time, their voices 
rose in excitement and their arms moved expressively as they exclaimed over the 
new arrival, which the audience later finds out is not a baby but a new sewing 
machine. 
</P>
<P>
 The acting was convincing enough to transport onlookers back to the place and 
time where the scene is set -- a small Russian village at the turn of the 
century. 
</P>
<P>
 This is not the only scene that Tino has had his hand in. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides being the student director for the play, the senior is also musical 
director and has taught all of his fellow cast members how to sing their parts. 
</P>
<P>
 When he is not behind the scenes directing, he is on the stage acting in the 
lead role of Tevye. 
</P>
<P>
 As cast member Sarah Weist said: "This play would not be without Tino." 
</P>
<P>
 Drama teacher Patricia Shepherd said she chose "Fiddler on the Roof" for this 
year's production only because she knew she could cast Tino as Tevye and his 
fellow senior Chava Shinault as Tino's wife, Golde. Chava won the school's best 
actress award last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Shepherd also decided to risk having Tino coach the students in singing, 
rather than hire a professional musical director. It's a risk that's paid off. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of these kids had never sung before in their lives," Shepherd said of 
the 65-member cast. "He has a lot of them sounding almost professional." 
</P>
<P>
 Voted most talented senior this year, Tino plays saxophone in the school band 
and performs after school and on weekends in a musical group called Satin Soul 
that is headed by Tino's father and includes his younger brother. 
</P>
<P>
 But Tino has never had formal lessons in either music or drama. 
</P>
<P>
 He has been accepted at Cal State Northridge, where he hopes to major in music 
next fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Tino's father, Toby Preciado, said he first noticed his son's talent when Tino 
was about 7. The family was riding in their car singing Christmas carols when 
suddenly young Tino began singing harmony. 
</P>
<P>
 "It really surprised me," said Preciado, a construction worker who plays both 
guitar and bass guitar. "I said, 'Who taught you how to do that?' He said, 'Oh, 
I just hear it in my head.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Remarkable as Tino's musical abilities are, his talent at directing and 
teaching his peers may be just as unusual, Shepherd said. Last year, when Tino 
was musical director for "Grease," the student cast members were surprised by 
how much work he expected from them, she said. This year, students who 
auditioned knew what they were getting into. 
</P>
<P>
 "So the ones that are in there are the ones willing to work as hard as he 
expects," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tino said he is comfortable giving orders because he's learned from his father 
that in any successful musical production, performers must follow directions 
from a single leader. 
</P>
<P>
 "In music there is no democracy," Tino said. "My father tells me that all the 
time." 
</P>
<P>
 Not that Tino is dictatorial. 
</P>
<P>
 Tall and soft-spoken, he raises his voice only rarely, such as to lightly 
scold some actors for not having memorized the lyrics to one of the play's 
songs. 
</P>
<P>
 And his classmates say he is patient. 
</P>
<P>
 "He goes through every song so every little thing sounds perfect," said 
17-year-old Christina Harvey, who plays a villager in the musical and is also 
costume and make-up director. "He makes us work hard." 
</P>
<P>
 Tino and other cast members agreed, however, that they must work hard because 
"Fiddler" is more of a challenge than other plays that students have performed 
in recent years at Channel Islands High. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a much more difficult play, musically and thematically," Tino said. 
</P>
<P>
 For one thing, it's more of a stretch for this racially diverse cast to act as 
the Russian Jewish characters in "Fiddler" than it was to play the high school 
students in "Grease," the students said. Only two of the 65 students in the 
"Fiddler" cast are Jewish. And many of the students said they have had little 
contact with Jewish culture. 
</P>
<P>
 So Shepherd has had both a teacher who is Jewish and a cantor talk to the cast 
about Judaism. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides being remote from the students' experiences, "Fiddler" is a drama, 
which both the cast and Shepherd say is more difficult to play than light 
comedy. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the audience isn't crying," at the end of the play, Shepherd told the cast 
recently, "we've failed." 
</P>
<P>
 To meet this challenge, the students rehearse during lunch and after school 
every day. But Tino goes further. 
</P>
<P>
 Every night, Tino's father said, the boy retreats to a room at the back of the 
house where he repeatedly plays recordings of the "Fiddler on the Roof" score 
as he practices the parts to every song. And on weekends he watches the 
videocassette version of the film. 
</P>
<P>
 "It drives him," Tino's father said. "There's no stopping him." FYI 
</P>
<P>
 "Fiddler on the Roof" will be performed at Channel Islands High School on 
Friday, April 22, and Saturday, April 23, at 7 p.m.; Thursday, April 28, and 
Friday, April 29, at 7 p.m.; and Saturday, April 30, at 2 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Admission is $7 for adults and $5 for students. The school is located at 1600 
Raiders Way in Oxnard, near Channel Islands Boulevard and Rose Avenue. For 
information, call the school drama department at 385-2776.

WEST VENTURA COUNTY EDITION: SATICOY; OFFICIALS SWEEP LEMONS AFTER FREEWAY 
SPILL 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 California Highway Patrol and state Department of Transportation officials 
worked for more than an hour Thursday to clean hundreds of lemons off the Santa 
Paula Freeway in Saticoy after two crates slipped off the back of a truck. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident, which occurred about 11 a.m. near Wells Road, renewed questions 
about the use of plastic shipping containers, which one local grower said are 
less expensive but are more prone to sliding off trucks. 
</P>
<P>
 "The contractors have been warned that they need to take more precautions to 
secure the plastic crates to the trucks because they're more slippery," said J. 
Link Leavens of Leavens Ranches in Ventura. "It's been a problem we've been 
encountering a lot recently." 
</P>
<P>
 Leavens, whose ranch was not involved in Thursday's spill, said the industry 
has gradually seen traditional wooden crates replaced by the plastic containers 
because they are cheaper, easily recycled and do less damage to the fruit 
during transit. MATTHEW MOSK

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: VOTERS' OK SOUGHT FOR WELDON LANDFILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOANNA M. MILLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A San Diego County firm has filed a request to place a measure on the November 
ballot that would bypass county authorities by seeking voter approval for a 
landfill at Weldon Canyon, elections officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 In an unprecedented move, Taconic Resources filed its request late Tuesday to 
place the initiative on the ballot, said Bruce Bradley, assistant registrar of 
voters for Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's never been done before with a land-use issue in Ventura County," Bradley 
said. "It's quite a unique effort." 
</P>
<P>
 If Taconic Resources is successful in obtaining 18,753 valid signatures by 
June 6, the measure would be placed on the general election ballot in November, 
Bradley said. 
</P>
<P>
 The initiative will ask voters to amend the county's General Plan and 
applicable zoning ordinances to allow construction of a landfill and recycling 
center on 551 acres at Weldon Canyon, about three miles north of Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 Waste Management Inc., which holds the lease to Weldon Canyon, withdrew its 
application for a land permit last summer after it became evident that the 
Board of Supervisors would defeat the measure. Taconic is now negotiating with 
Waste Management to take over the lease and would withdraw the initiative if no 
agreement is reached, said Richard Chase, Taconic general partner. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would expect us to have an agreement by this week," Chase said. "But you 
never know when a last-minute issue could arise." 
</P>
<P>
 Chase said he went forward with the filing to get the measure on the November 
ballot. Taconic figures it would take a year after voter approval to get other 
state, federal and local permits needed and six months to build the landfill 
after that. 
</P>
<P>
 The western county's largest dump, Bailard Landfill in Oxnard, is scheduled to 
close in 1997. JOANNA M. MILLER

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: NATURAL GAS SUPPLIERS FACE $16-MILLION SUIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF McDONALD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Lawyers for Southern California Gas Co. have filed a $16-million suit against 
Texaco and four other natural gas providers, claiming they contaminated the gas 
supply and threatened the health of customers in Ojai and Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 The complaint, filed in Ventura County Superior Court earlier this week, seeks 
to recover what the gas company contends it spent to repair or replace 
potentially damaged valves, regulators and meters. 
</P>
<P>
 Texaco, Conoco, Shell Western, Seneca Resources Corp. and Santa Fe Energy 
Operating Partners introduced nitrous oxide, nitrogen dioxide and sodium 
dioxide into the supply of natural gas, the suit said. 
</P>
<P>
 The contamination allegedly occurred at a facility in School Canyon, where 
Texaco last month was raided by investigators from the Ventura County district 
attorney's office for allegedly leaking 370,000 gallons of toxic fuel into the 
ground water supply. 
</P>
<P>
 The defendants' "introduction of the contaminants into the natural gas supply 
in Ventura and Ojai threatened the safety of residents in the area," the suit 
contends. 
</P>
<P>
 Gas company officials spent $16 million to repair the damage "in order to 
maintain the integrity of its pipeline and to prevent the release of 
contaminants into the environment," according to the suit. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney Terry D. Avchen, who filed the suit for Southern California Gas, said 
his clients inspected the majority of the homes and businesses since the 
contamination was discovered in July, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "So far, most all of the 34,000 homes in the targeted area have been visited 
and thousands of devices have been replaced at no charge to the customers," 
Avchen said. 
</P>
<P>
 A Texaco spokesman on Thursday declined to comment, saying the company had not 
yet reviewed the lawsuit. JEFF McDONALD

WEST VENTURA COUNTY EDITION: PORT HUENEME; CITY WON'T REPLACE RECREATION 
DIRECTOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK McCARTNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a sign of its continuing budget problems, Port Hueneme will not replace the 
city's recreation and community service director when he resigns next month to 
accept a position with another city. 
</P>
<P>
 With the departure of Brady Cherry on May 3, the city will shift recreation 
and landscape duties to the director of the city's community center and to the 
public works department. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision marks the third time in little more than a year that Port Hueneme 
has left unfilled a top management position, cutting the number of city 
department heads by half. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Hanks retired as finance director in 1992 and Jack Duffy retired as public 
works director last year. Both men have continued to act as consultants to Port 
Hueneme. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're all a little shell-shocked," said Tom Figg, city community development 
director and one of three surviving department directors. 
</P>
<P>
 While Figg said budget cutbacks have forced the city to become "leaner and 
more efficient," he said Port Hueneme residents will have to decide how much 
the city can afford to cut. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who knows how much cutting we can do before we gouge out the heart of the 
community?" he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cherry, 38, leaves Port Hueneme after six years to become the director of 
community services for the town of Atascadero in San Luis Obispo County. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, Cherry said his decision to leave did not stem from cutbacks in 
the Port Hueneme recreation budget, which had curtailed many of the city's 
recreational programs. But he described the $900,000 in budget cuts the past 
two years as painful. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think the city can afford to lose any more management," Cherry said. 
"This organization is extremely thin, almost to the point where it threatens 
good governing." 
</P>
<P>
 In the last two years, the city has left unfilled a police lieutenant's 
position and the posts of city finance director and public works director. The 
city has redistributed some of their duties among other personnel and employed 
the former directors as part-time consultants. 
</P>
<P>
 In June, residents will vote on a $500,000 tax assessment to retain the city's 
Police Department and restore the lieutenant's position. If the measure fails, 
city leaders will have to decide whether to impose a utility tax or contract 
with the Ventura County Sheriff's Department or Oxnard Police Department for 
police services. 
</P>
<P>
 Figg said residents will have to weigh the cost against the level of services 
they have come to expect. 
</P>
<P>
 "I personally believe the majority of people in the community feel strongly 
about Port Hueneme's identity," Figg said. PATRICK McCARTNEY

WEST VENTURA COUNTY EDITION: VENTURA; MAN HURT IN FALL OFF ROOF OF COUNTY 
OFFICE 
</P>

<P>
 A 30-year-old man was injured early Thursday when he fell from the roof of 
county offices behind Ventura City Hall, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 A Ventura police officer found fall victim Brian Mahoney and Paul Belman, 30, 
outside the county offices about 2 a.m., according to Ventura Police Lt. David 
Ingles. 
</P>
<P>
 After talking to the men and noticing a broken window next to the roof from 
which Mahoney fell, police arrested Belman on suspicion of attempted burglary. 
Because of his injuries, Mahoney was not arrested, Ingles said, adding that he 
believes the men were from outside the area. 
</P>
<P>
 Mahoney was listed in stable condition at Ojai Valley Hospital late Thursday. 
He sustained hip and shoulder injuries, according to fire officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Employees at the Ventura County Public Social Services Agency said they were 
baffled by the incident and could find nothing missing from their offices. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got a call around 2:30 this morning that someone had fallen trying to 
break in here," said Jim Isom, director of public social services. "We think 
they may have been trying to get into City Hall." 
</P>
<P>
 Isom said the only evidence that something was amiss was the broken window 
along the corridor that connects the county office to City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know what they were doing on the roof," Isom said. "But I'm sure at 2 
a.m., their goals were not honorable." MATTHEW MOSK

WEST VENTURA COUNTY EDITION: ANACAPA ISLAND; STUDENTS TO UPROOT INVADING ICE 
PLANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY WILSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A group of Nordhoff High School students will set sail for Anacapa Island on 
Friday for a three-day environmental cleanup project aimed at uprooting 
invading ice plant that is threatening native flowers on the island. 
</P>
<P>
 About six members of the Ojai school's environmental club and two teachers 
will camp on Anacapa for the weekend to lend a helping hand to the island's 
fragile ecosystem. 
</P>
<P>
 "I called up the Friends of the Channel Islands to talk about island cleanup 
and one of the projects they talked about was ice plant eradication -- that 
sounded like fun," said James Velasquez, a 17-year-old senior who spearheaded 
the project. "Somebody needs to do that kind of work." 
</P>
<P>
 The Channel Islands National Park, which includes Anacapa Island, must rely on 
volunteers to help maintain the five-island park because of budget constraints. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are so many people who want to see the islands, this gives them an 
opportunity," said Cherryl Wendel, business manager of the Friends of the 
Channel Islands, a nonprofit group that organizes volunteer work projects. 
</P>
<P>
 Ice plant, which was introduced on Anacapa in the early 1900s to curb soil 
erosion, has taken over in recent years, threatening to crowd out native plant 
species like the flowering giant coreopsis, Wendel said. 
</P>
<P>
 The students will remove about 50 tons of ice plant, which will to to the 
island's compost facility, Wendel said. 
</P>
<P>
 The students, who have sold T-shirts to raise money to pay for the trip, hope 
to catch a glimpse of migrating gray whales or dolphins. But their main goal is 
to benefit the island. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it would be a lot of help if we could get this going and be able to 
restore the island back to its native state," James said. TRACY WILSON

WEST VENTURA COUNTY EDITION: OXNARD; MAN SHOT IN QUARREL OVER PARKING SPACE

<TEXT>
<P>
 Oxnard police are searching for a suspect who shot a man in the carport of an 
apartment complex after arguing over a parking space, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tyrone Small, 23, was found bleeding from the head inside the carport at 901 
W. Gonzales Road about 6:25 p.m. Wednesday after nearby residents called police 
to report gunshots. 
</P>
<P>
 Small had been shot in the skull, but police said the wound was superficial. 
Small was treated at St. John's Regional Medical Center and released late 
Wednesday, hospital officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Small told police he had been fighting with another man over a parking space 
when the other man pulled out a .22-caliber rifle and fired five rounds at him. 
The suspect, who appeared to be about 25 years old, then sped off in a red 
sports car, police said. JULIE FIELDS

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; MAN GETS 48 YEARS FOR MOLESTING GIRL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DWAYNE BRAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Superior Court judge Thursday denied a convicted Simi Valley child molester 
a new trial and sentenced the man to 48 years in state prison for attacks on an 
8-year-old girl. 
</P>
<P>
 A jury found James Centobene guilty of 22 felony counts of child molestation, 
including 15 that included substantial sexual contact such as sodomy, oral 
copulation, masturbation and exposure to pornography. 
</P>
<P>
 The jury also convicted the 29-year-old man of three misdemeanor counts of 
child annoyance, which stemmed from baths he took with the girl. The attacks 
occurred from January, 1991, to January, 1992, when the girl was 8 and 9 years 
old, Deputy Dist. Atty. Dee Corona said. She said the girl's teacher reported 
the attacks to authorities. The girl told her teacher about the attacks, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge James McNally handed down the 48-year prison term during a hearing in 
which Centobene claimed his lawyer did not properly represent him and requested 
a new trial. Centobene represented himself at the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 A probation report described Centobene as a "very disturbed individual" with a 
"hostile attitude" toward the charges he faced. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mr. Centobene deserves all the time he can get," Corona said afterward. "He 
never acknowledged responsibility." 
</P>
<P>
 His wife, 33-year-old Elba Centobene, pleaded guilty to one count of perjury 
for lying during her husband's trial about having knowledge of the attacks on 
the girl. DWAYNE BRAY

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; MAN CUT, CAR BASHED IN GANG ASSAULT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sheriff's deputies are investigating a gang-related attack in which a 
19-year-old Thousand Oaks man was cut slightly with a knife while his car was 
bashed with baseball bats and sticks, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sgt. Mike De Los Santos said the attack, which occurred just before 6:30 p.m. 
Wednesday, appeared to be connected to two earlier incidents of gang violence: 
a similar car vandalism on a residential street April 1 and the shooting of a 
17-year-old male on Easter during a dispute involving gang members. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday's incident occurred as Kevin Thompson stopped his car at the 
intersection of East Hillcrest Drive and Hodencamp Road. Thompson told deputies 
he noticed a tan car idling next to his, then heard something strike his 
vehicle. When he looked back, he saw a youth holding an aluminum baseball bat 
and yelling gang slogans, deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
 After getting out of his car, Thompson spotted two more carloads of 12 to 15 
teen-agers who began yelling gang slogans and smashing his car with baseball 
bats and sticks, causing $2,000 in damage, deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
 Several suspects also approached Thompson yelling profanities, including 
18-year-old Farzad (Steve) Soodavar who allegedly threatened Thompson with a 
knife, authorities said. Soodavar then allegedly threw the knife at Thompson, 
hitting him in the arm and cutting him slightly, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Soodavar was later arrested on suspicion of assault with a deadly weapon and 
booked into jail at the East Valley Sheriff's Station in Thousand Oaks. He was 
being held in lieu of $5,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
 More arrests stemming from the three incidents are possible, De Los Santos 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators said they do not believe Thompson is a gang member, but that he 
knew the suspects from earlier encounters. 
</P>
<P>
 "During this incident, Thompson was basically driving down the street minding 
his own business," said De Los Santos. JULIE FIELDS

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; HISTORICAL PARK HIT BY QUAKE TO REOPEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY F. POLS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Several historic buildings and the grounds of Strathearn Historical Park in 
Simi Valley will reopen this weekend for the first time since the earthquake 
rumbled through. 
</P>
<P>
 The park contains some of the region's oldest structures, as well as farm 
equipment, furnishings and clothing from the first American settlers in the 
valley.The Jan. 17 quake did extensive damage to two buildings at the park. 
</P>
<P>
 While the park was closed, docents refurbished the Colony House, which had 
been brought by train from Chicago to Saticoy in 1888. It was prefabricated to 
Midwestern tastes -- including a steeply pitched roof to shed snow. From 
Saticoy, the house came piece by piece on wagons and was rebuilt in Simi 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 The Colony House was moved to the Strathearn site in 1970 after its owners, 
the Talley family, donated it to the park district. It has been restored to 
give visitors the feeling of a turn-of-the-century home, rather than a museum. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a wonderful teaching facility," volunteer Jean Kelly said. "This is 
the kind of museum that the Smithsonian can't operate, where everything is 
displayed in an original setting, so it's really an important site." 
</P>
<P>
 Other exhibits reopening Saturday include the original Simi Valley library, 
which was moved to the park in the 1970s, two barns with displays of farm 
equipment and old household items, the visitors center and the gift shop. 
</P>
<P>
 Tours will resume Saturdays and Sundays from 1 to 4 p.m. Every Wednesday, the 
park is open for one tour starting at 1 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The Simi Adobe, the city's oldest remaining dwelling from Spanish settlement, 
and the Strathearn house will remain closed indefinitely due to quake damage. 
Park officials say the adobe needs a complete seismic upgrading. MARY F. POLS

CONDUCTOR SEEKS ENCORE FOR LOCAL ORCHESTRA; SIMI VALLEY: NEW RESIDENT PHILIPPE 
FANJEAUD GATHERS MUSICIANS TO BUILD A CHAMBER ENSEMBLE. A PREVIOUS ATTEMPT FELL 
APART IN 1990. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Using empty chairs to prop up their sheet music on the cramped stage, a small 
ensemble of musicians coaxed the opening notes out of their instruments -- the 
beginning of what they hope will be a Simi Valley-based chamber orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
 Conductor Philippe Fanjeaud, 44, followed along, reading the music while 
keeping tempo with a wave of his hand. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was good," Fanjeaud said after the group of strangers played for the first 
time. "Nobody knew the work we were playing, but everyone did quite well." 
</P>
<P>
 Fanjeaud, a French-born composer, organized the meeting after being approached 
by a few other local musicians who heard about his experience conducting 
musical groups. They wanted him to help resurrect a community-based orchestra 
in Simi Valley.  
</P>
<P>
 Fanjeaud has not had a chance to conduct since he worked with the Berkeley 
String Ensemble seven years ago in the Bay Area. Volunteering to conduct was a 
chance to get back to doing what he loved, he said, and become involved in his 
newly adopted community. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a really great way to participate and get to know people," said 
Fanjeaud, who moved to Simi Valley from Los Angeles County with his American 
wife and two children six months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 A professional musician most of his life, Fanjeaud said he now makes his 
living composing scores for television and movies from his studio at home. He 
said his latest project consists of converting the orchestration of classical 
music to computer disks for a computer company in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 His work with the chamber would just be another way of sharing his love for 
classical music, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a lot of people here that desire something like this," he said. "I 
think Simi really needs an orchestra." 
</P>
<P>
 About 15 musicians, ranging in age from their early teens to their late 40s, 
came out for the chamber orchestra's first meeting at the Simi Valley Civic 
Arts building.  
</P>
<P>
 "We had 13- and 14-year-olds who really did their job," Fanjeaud said. "I was 
really pleased there were so many young musicians. It proves that people 
shouldn't make general criticism of young people today. This takes a tremendous 
amount of work. We should promote and encourage these kids." 
</P>
<P>
 Fanjeaud said he hoped the group would eventually attract about 25 people who 
could form a small chamber orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had three violinists," he said. "My dream would be for at least 20 -- 
enough for a full orchestra, but I'm not dreaming. If we had seven, that would 
be enough." 
</P>
<P>
 A community-based orchestra in Simi Valley failed in 1990 after losing its 
practice space, recalled Irene Silbert, a musician active in the local arts 
community. The director of that orchestra, Ingrid Ely, could not keep the group 
together after she and her husband, the late James (Tom) Ely, were investigated 
for misappropriating funds from the Ventura County Community College District. 
</P>
<P>
 "But don't even mention that orchestra in the same breath as this one," 
Silbert said. "We're not resurrecting the old orchestra. This will be totally 
different." 
</P>
<P>
 Silbert said that the idea to form the group arose when her longtime friend, 
Fanjeaud, moved to Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was an opportunity," she said. "A professional conductor came to the area 
who doesn't have an orchestra but wants to practice his craft. Along with that 
is the fact that in this city of 100,000 people, there are a lot of decent 
musicians who need a venue in which to play." 
</P>
<P>
 James Hanna, 42, a professional musician who works for orchestras throughout 
the Southland, played his viola in the group. His son looked on from seats in 
front of the stage while listening to rock music on his headphones. 
</P>
<P>
 "I live in Simi Valley and I feel this is a service to the community," Hanna 
said. "It might have started out a little rough, but it will snowball into 
something."  
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley Cultural Arts Assn. President Jan Glasband said she hopes interest 
in the group takes off. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any kind of cultural enlightenment for Simi Valley is welcome," she said.  
</P>
<P>
 If the group succeeds and expands into a full-sized symphony orchestra, 
Glasband said, they might be able to perform in the new Cultural Arts Center. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it works out, that might be a nice home for them," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 For his part, Fanjeaud said he is upbeat about the future of the fledgling 
group. He said the next step was to obtain additional sheet music for each of 
the instruments before the group's second meeting on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "For now we'll stick to the classics like Mozart and Haydn," he said. "I think 
with two months practice we'll be ready for our first concert." FYI 
</P>
<P>
 Musicians interested in joining the chamber orchestra should attend the next 
meeting scheduled for 7 p.m. on Wednesday at the Simi Valley Cultural Arts 
Center, 3190 Cochran Street, Simi Valley. For more information call Irene 
Silbert at (818) 346-7278.

NEW RESEARCH TO SPARE SIMI LAB; SCIENCE: THE DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY, WHICH HAD 
PLANNED TO SHUT DOWN THE SITE, WILL STUDY A NEW TECHNOLOGY FOR ELECTRICAL 
GENERATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 The Department of Energy announced Thursday that it will keep open its Energy 
Technology Engineering Center near Simi Valley to do research on a promising 
new technology for electrical power generation, known as the Kalina Cycle. 
</P>
<P>
 The center had been scheduled for closure in September, with a loss of 200 
high-tech jobs. It is operated by the Rocketdyne division of Rockwell 
International, which for decades tested components for nuclear power plants at 
the site. 
</P>
<P>
 "The issue in my mind was that we cannot lose this resource," Energy Secretary 
Hazel O'Leary said Thursday at a news conference in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The center, part of the Department of Energy's Santa Susana Field Laboratory, 
is now assured funding through 1995 and will get a budget hike of $11.6 
million, most of it to test the new technology, a prototype of which is already 
in place. 
</P>
<P>
 Community groups and proponents of an advanced transportation industry in 
Southern California have been lobbying hard to keep the site open. In December, 
DOE successfully sought out industrial partners to help support the center's 
continued operation. 
</P>
<P>
 "The future of ETEC really gives us something positive to look forward to," 
said Bonny Matheson, president of Valley Industry and Commerce Assn., which 
represents more than 350 businesses in Ventura and Los Angeles counties. 
Matheson also spoke at Thursday's news conference. 
</P>
<P>
 The energy technology center's mission to develop cleaner and more efficient 
energy systems could also help create more jobs and give local businesses a 
much-needed boost, said Matheson, who met with O'Leary in February to talk 
about saving the $1-billion lab. 
</P>
<P>
 "Businesses have been so battered after years of tragedy and disaster that 
this is just a wonderful ray of light," Matheson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Anthony Beilenson (D-Woodland Hills) helped arrange the meeting between 
O'Leary and business leaders. "We hope we can look back in a couple of years 
and see that this not only saved jobs but created other jobs," Beilenson said. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Leary said Thursday that future funding will depend on how successful the 
center is in attracting private businesses interested in working with the 
facility. Southern California Gas Co. has already expressed interest in working 
with the center to develop new uses for natural gas, and Caltrans is also 
interested in using the lab. 
</P>
<P>
 "We still think that a focus on transportation technologies is a premiere use 
of the site, and we will be working to get DOE's additional support," said John 
Slifko, special assistant for technology policy to Rep. Howard L. Berman 
(D-Panorama City). 
</P>
<P>
 But so far, plans focus on development of the new electricity-generation 
process, Robert LeChevalier, DOE site manager, said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a really significant event," LeChevalier said. "It's the first new 
thermodynamic cycle that's been invented since 1895." 
</P>
<P>
 The new concept was devised by Alexander Kalina, an engineer from the former 
Soviet Union now living in Northern California. Potentially, it could use 
almost any heat source -- fueled by natural gas, coal or geothermal or solar 
energy -- to produce electricity 20% more efficiently than current turbine 
technology. 
</P>
<P>
 An improvement of this magnitude could mean billions of dollars in energy 
savings in this country and internationally. The technology center has the 
world's sole operating model of the device. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've demonstrated the principles of the cycle," LeChevalier said, "and a 
number of large utility suppliers are very interested . . . one is General 
Electric." 
</P>
<P>
 The center also has ongoing projects in renewable technologies, energy 
conservation and earthquake-effects testing. Researchers there can test the 
effects of seismic events on components used to isolate buildings and bridges 
from earthquake impacts, or such utility structures as pipe systems in power 
plants.

THOUSAND OAKS LIBRARY TO REOPEN AS QUAKE REPAIRS CONTINUE; RECOVERY: THE MAIN 
BRANCH WILL RESUME OPERATIONS APRIL 18 WITH BARE FLOORS AND EXPOSED GIRDERS BUT 
FULL SHELVES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The Thousand Oaks Library will reopen in 10 days with cold concrete floors, 
exposed metal girders and glaring temporary lights. But the shelves will be 
full and the collection up-to-date. 
</P>
<P>
 A low-key celebration will welcome patrons to the Janss Road library at 9 a.m. 
April 18, four months after the Northridge earthquake shook loose the metal 
ceiling, ruptured water pipes and tossed thousands of books from the shelves. 
</P>
<P>
 While the library has been declared structurally sound, the city has not yet 
been able to replace the sodden carpet or redesign the drop ceiling, which 
reflected light into reading areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, officials have decided to open the 290,000-volume collection to the 
public a week from Monday, "barring unforeseen circumstances," Deputy Library 
Director Steve Brogden said. 
</P>
<P>
 Librarians have continued to order new books and collect current magazines 
during the hiatus, so "we'll have pretty close to full shelves," Brogden said. 
Officials have even replaced most of the children's puppets, which got soaked 
when a central water pipe burst. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are excited -- they've been waiting for this," said Antoinette 
Hagopian, a member of the Library Restoration Committee. "In Thousand Oaks, the 
library really is the heart of the community." 
</P>
<P>
 But for five days before the grand reopening, Thousand Oaks readers will have 
no library at all. 
</P>
<P>
 Because staff must transfer computers, reference materials and books from the 
Newbury Park branch to the main library, both will be closed from April 13 
through 17. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're hoping people will be as understanding then as they have been through 
this whole process," Brogden said. 
</P>
<P>
 Both libraries will resume regular hours April 18. 
</P>
<P>
 As patrons stream back into the stripped-down main library, fund-raisers will 
continue to try to drum up money to help pay for the $2.5 million in earthquake 
damage. 
</P>
<P>
 The federal government and insurance payments will cover much of the cost, but 
city officials have not yet learned the exact breakdown. Early estimates pegged 
the city's total responsibility at $250,000. 
</P>
<P>
 To meet that challenge, a Library Restoration Committee has launched a series 
of fund-raisers, from traditional bake sales to an unusual Hard Hat Art Day for 
children to draw on the library's newly exposed concrete floor. 
</P>
<P>
 In another ongoing campaign, the Friends of the Library has been selling mock 
stock for $20 a share. With each purchase, shareholders receive a certificate 
and the right to imprint their name on any book in the library. 
</P>
<P>
 Stock sales have reaped $3,000 since the earthquake -- as much as the campaign 
generated during the previous two years, according to Kathy Lewis, president of 
Friends of the Library. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just been going gangbusters," Lewis said. "It's tiring and exciting at 
the same time." 
</P>
<P>
 So far, the various fund-raising efforts have raised $25,000, and restoration 
committee members are determined to quadruple that sum. They've been getting a 
boost from a steady trickle of children's pennies, nickels and quarters 
collected in school coin drives. 
</P>
<P>
 Every child who contributes can sign a "Children's Giving Book," which will 
remain in the library's permanent collection as a record of community support. 
</P>
<P>
 Recognizing that apple pies and coin drives -- and even fake stock sales -- 
will not raise enough money to pay all the bills, restoration committee members 
plan an appeal to private corporations once they figure out the city's bill. 
</P>
<P>
 And a local photographer, Planning Commissioner Forrest Frields, has announced 
a photography contest to raise money for refurbishing the library. Winning 
photos of the Conejo Valley's wetlands, oaks or scenic vistas will be published 
on postcards, posters and calendars and sold on behalf of the library. FYI 
</P>
<P>
 The Thousand Oaks Library will be reopen April 18 with its normal schedule: 
Monday through Thursday,10 a.m. to 9 p.m.; Saturday, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; and 
Sunday, 1 p.m. to 5 p.m. The Newbury Park branch, which had extended hours to 
serve Thousand Oaks readers, will be closed from Wednesday through April 17 so 
librarians can return borrowed volumes and rearrange the reading room. Starting 
April 18, the branch will resume regular hours: Monday through Wednesday, noon 
to 9 p.m.; Thursday, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.; and Saturday, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.

'MAME' AGES GRACEFULLY; * JULIET PROWSE REPRISES THE LEAD ROLE IN THE ROUSING 
MUSICAL AT THE ALEX THEATRE. JOHN BOWAB, WHO DIRECTED THE STAR 20 YEARS AGO, 
RETURNS TO THE HELM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T.H. McCULLOH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; T.H. McCulloh writes regularly about 
theater for The Times. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Mame" is almost 30 years old and, like its title song says, may "never go 
away again." 
</P>
<P>
 Jerome Lawrence and Robert E. Lee's musical version of their hit play "Aun tie 
Mame," adapted from Patrick Dennis' novel, and with a score by Jerry Herman, 
opens tomorrow night at the Alex Theatre, and according to its star and 
director, is as spry as ever. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Juliet Prowse, who plays the indomitable lady, and director John Bowab 
know Mame Dennis intimately. Bowab was associate producer of the original 
Broadway show, which starred Angela Lansbury. He's directed what he says is a 
"possible 20 ladies" in the title role, including Lansbury in 1972 and 1975 
revivals and in a limited Broadway run in 1983. He guided the first stock 
production with Ann Miller, first directed Prowse in the role 20 years ago in 
Texas and on tour at Lake Tahoe and Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
 "I keep saying," Bowab admits, "that I'm never going to do it again, never. 
But it's such a fun show to do, and it's very hard to say no to Juliet. And 
'Mame' holds such great memories for me. From the beginning it was a happy 
experience. It has meant a great deal to me." 
</P>
<P>
 Bowab, who spends most of his time these days directing television sitcoms 
from "Soap" and "Bosom Buddies" to more than 200 episodes of "The Facts of 
Life," is staging this production in the middle of his busy pilot season 
schedule. But he says it's a breeze. 
</P>
<P>
 He explains: "I came in thinking, 'Here we go again.' A lot of times you'll be 
directing and you think, 'Will this day never end?' But with 'Mame' I find 
myself rehearsing until 9 o'clock, and the show doesn't get me tired." 
</P>
<P>
 Juliet Prowse feels the same way about Herman's classic musical comedy. She 
first appeared in the show in London when she replaced Ginger Rogers, 20 years 
ago. It was the beginning of a long and loving relationship. Born in Bombay and 
raised in South Africa, Prowse had her training as a ballet dancer, which led 
her to London at 17, to ballet and eventually to musical films and theater. Her 
international career has encompassed film and television as well as heading the 
casts of such perennial favorites as "Irma La Douce," "Damn Yankees" and 
"Chicago." 
</P>
<P>
 But somehow she, like Bowab, keeps coming back to "Mame." 
</P>
<P>
 When Prowse initially did the show, in her early 30s, she felt she was too 
young for the role. Since then she has raised a son to the age of the adult 
Patrick in the show, and says the 20 years that have passed have made her 
better in the role of Mame. 
</P>
<P>
 "Age has a lot to do with it," Prowse says. "I've had a lot more experience. 
I've grown with it. And I've had a son. I've had the personal experience of 
bringing up a child, going through the whole thing. Now when I sing 'If He 
Walked Into My Life' in the show, I really have something direct to relate to. 
And Patrick's coming from the young child to the grown-up man, I've gone 
through that process with my own child. That's a great learning experience." 
</P>
<P>
 The parallels between the eccentric Mame and the show business mother are 
undeniable. Prowse compares Mame's several-year honeymoon in the play with her 
own parental problems while touring. "It's the same thing," she says. "You're 
always on the road, having to leave your children places, different schools, 
with people to take care of them while you're gone. And it's the guilt you get, 
which has a lot to do with when Mame says if he walked into my life, did I do 
this enough, did I do too much of that. It's all of that, the fact that you 
weren't there those times you should have been." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Prowse says experience has also taught her how to present Mame honestly. "She 
does live this life, but she is also a very real person. When the child comes 
into her life, it does make a difference. She suddenly realizes this is 
something special. This is something that's been missing in her life. 
Responsibility is what it is. Yes, she's a very up person, but she's a very 
warm, loving being. I don't see her as bizarre at all." 
</P>
<P>
 Even having played the role as often as she has, Prowse says that keeping her 
performance fresh is no problem. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "The wonderful thing about this role," she explains, "is that you're in 
everything so you don't have time to think about anything else except getting 
out there and making it like the first time ever. As an actor, you have to do 
that for yourself for self-protection. It's a great way to hone your craft, 
being able to do it every night and find new things. Suddenly you'll find 
something new that just happens in the performance. Those are little things you 
can hold onto so your performance is going to get bigger and rounder." 
</P>
<P>
 Bowab agrees, even after having seen the show, he says with a laugh, "maybe 
5,000 times. New people bring you new things. A lot of times you get a new 
actor -- this time Gretchen Wyler is playing the actress, Vera Charles -- and 
you get a different feeling. Certainly you can't say Angela Lansbury and Ann 
Miller in the same sentence, but each one of them brought a different quality 
to it. Ann brought a party-girl atmosphere to the role. Juliet brings a kind of 
sexual energy to Mame that some of the others didn't. 
</P>
<P>
 "To the audience," Bowab says, "whether they're young or old, Mame has become 
folklore. Before she even hits the top of the stairs, they're already prepared 
for someone eccentric, attractive, off-center. The actress just has to be an 
extension of herself. That's what the joy is here." WHERE AND WHEN

A PROTEST OUT OF AFRICA; * MOHAMED OMER BUSHARA'S STEREOTYPE-DEFYING WORK 
REFLECTS OPPRESSION IN HIS NATIVE SUDAN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A chance meeting in Africa has affected the lives of two very different 
people. Sondra Hale, who teaches anthropology and women's studies at UCLA, met 
Sudanese artist Mohamed Omer Bushara in Sudan in 1972. He was working at the 
Department of Culture in Khartoum. 
</P>
<P>
 She had first visited Sudan in the early 1960s, and returned after earning a 
master's degree in African studies, to do research for her doctorate in 
anthropology. 
</P>
<P>
 Bushara, using everyday objects in his office -- pen and ink, markers, matches 
and scraps of paper -- was making small-scale drawings. Though they appeared 
whimsical, Hale also saw serious ironies in Bushara's work. 
</P>
<P>
 The artist, then 26, had never shown his work to the public. Self-taught, he 
chose drawing as a way to convey his feelings about his culture. 
</P>
<P>
 "My contribution was professionalizing his life," Hale said. "I convinced him 
to show his work." 
</P>
<P>
 Two years later, he had his first solo show in Khartoum. Out of that show, he 
won first prize in a visual arts competition sponsored by African Arts 
magazine, and a scholarship to the Slade School of Fine Art in London. 
</P>
<P>
 Hale is now introducing Bushara's work to the West Coast with the exhibit 
"Mohamed Omer Bushara: Protest Art and Sudan, 1973-1993." It was originally 
organized through Cal State Northridge's Art Galleries and was scheduled to 
open there in February until the Jan. 17 earthquake closed the gallery. The 
Armory Center for the Arts in Pasadena graciously made space available. 
</P>
<P>
 Hale, who besides her adjunct associate professorship at UCLA chairs the 
women's studies department at Cal State Northridge, curated the exhibit of more 
than 200 drawings, etchings, artist's books and sculpture. Sabrina Lynn Motley, 
a doctoral candidate in anthropology at UCLA and lecturer at Otis School of 
Art/Design, helped curate. 
</P>
<P>
 Hale and Motley see the show not only as a spotlight on Bushara's work, but as 
a "test of our stereotypes" about African art, Hale said. "To walk in a room 
where there is no kinta cloth or baskets, and to think of Bushara, who is a 
Muslim, but doesn't do the stereotype of (traditionally calligraphic) Islamic 
art. He does human forms. This is not a man apart from his culture. To have 
somebody think about African art differently would be enough for me." 
</P>
<P>
 "Art in Africa has been dynamic and innovative and continues to grow," Motley 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sudan, the largest country in Africa, gained its independence from Britain in 
1956. It was the first sub-Saharan country to free itself from European 
domination. Nevertheless, the military has often governed the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Hale said Sudan is one of the 25 poorest countries in the world. Among its 
population of about 25 million are more than 500 ethnic groups, 110 languages 
and hundreds of religions and religious sects. However, an estimated 70% of the 
population is Sunni Muslim. 
</P>
<P>
 "In 1989, an ultraconservative, Islamist military junta came to power," Hale 
has written in a curator's statement. "Sudan is now an Islamic state, with 
sharia (religious law) in effect. All political parties, interest groups, 
unions and professional associations are banned, as were most of the 
newspapers." 
</P>
<P>
 Bushara, reacting to the military dictatorship in the '70s and '80s, "was part 
of an outspoken leftist contingency in Sudan. He wrote art criticism, and 
illustrated political stories against the government," Hale said. Feeling the 
threat to his artistic freedom, in the early '80s he left for Saudi Arabia, 
where he still lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the earlier works in the show is Bushara's two-part "Seasons of Our 
Discontent," a 1975 collaboration with Hale. Her haiku verse and his drawings 
convey the weight of oppression and political corruption on the people. 
</P>
<P>
 Bushara "likes to have people engage with him in his art," Hale said, "to 
break down the notion of artist as estranged character removed from society. 
Anything that could be mass-produced serves his purposes. All objects in nature 
and society could be art. The stuff he did with coffee and sugar disintegrated. 
I would write him and say, 'Bugs ate your art.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The 1975 "Self-Portrait" in the show was fashioned out of wood. "He said, 'I 
saw this piece of wood on the ground, and it looked like me,' " Hale said. "He 
is the most unpretentious artist and intellectual. He's political in the 
humanitarian sense of depicting poor, sad children, but his work is also 
comical and often beautiful, poetic and loving." 
</P>
<P>
 But there are also the chilling etchings he did while at the Slade school 
(1976-77). The suggestion of death by torture and execution is omnipresent in 
these images. A soldier eats a person in Bushara's 1976 ink-wash drawing from 
the "Political Series of Four." In his most recent work, the human figure is 
becoming increasingly more abstract, each image less lyrical and quirky. 
</P>
<P>

ROLL OVER BEETHOVEN; * JEFF BERLIN LEAVES THE VIOLIN AND CLASSICAL MUSIC BEHIND 
TO BUILD A SUBSTANTIAL REPUTATION AS A DYNAMIC JAZZ/ROCK BASSIST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN STEWART, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Zan Stewart writes regularly about jazz 
for The Times.

<TEXT>
<P>
 In the beginning, when he was a preteen growing up in Great Neck, N.Y., Jeff 
Berlin had a secret life. 
</P>
<P>
 When his parents, brothers and sisters were out of the house, he used to stand 
on a chair in the dining room and conduct Beethoven music as it played on 
records on the stereo. 
</P>
<P>
 "Beethoven had an astonishing effect on me. I was so moved. That great music 
was so dramatic," says Berlin, who has since carved out a substantial 
reputation as a dynamic jazz/rock bassist, playing with such notables as John 
McLaughlin, Yes and k.d. lang. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even now, remembering that music, it's giving me a little lump," says Berlin, 
touching his throat and looking emotional as he talks with a reporter in the 
Room Upstairs at Le Cafe in Sherman Oaks, where he performs Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, though, Beethoven had to make way for Jack Bruce. 
</P>
<P>
 Berlin, son of opera singer Samuel Berlin, grew up playing music, starting 
violin at age 5. But at 12, he heard the group Cream, with whom Bruce played 
bass, and both his instruments, and his heroes, flip-flopped. Inspired by 
Bruce, he stopped playing violin -- "I hated it as a teen-ager" -- and used 
money he'd earned from a paper route to buy an electric bass. Within six 
months, he was playing in local rock bands. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rock was breathtaking," says Berlin, 41. "I still enjoy, the feeling, its 
energy, power, rhythm. That's what sent me through the roof. I thought, 'How 
can I participate in this?' I wanted to listen to Beethoven, but I wanted to 
play with Jack Bruce, with Jimi Hendrix, all those guys." 
</P>
<P>
 Bruce, who with guitarist Eric Clapton and drummer Ginger Baker formed Cream, 
stimulated Berlin to pursue the multifaceted direction on which he has built 
his career. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Jack created incredible bass events. He played both rhythmically and 
melodically," says Berlin, who was born in Far Rockaway, N.Y., and who lives 
with his wife and child in North Hollywood. Bruce was also the first player 
Berlin heard who improvised, who made "something out of nothing. He was a 
soloist and bass player, and that's what I like to consider myself." Berlin's 
musical sensibilities were fleshed out when he attended Berklee College of 
Music in Boston from 1972 to 1975. There, studying arranging and composition, 
he was exposed to such jazz artists as saxophonist Cannonball Adderley, pianist 
Bill Evans and trumpeter Miles Davis. 
</P>
<P>
 At Berklee, Berlin played with many of the top jazz artists of today, among 
them guitarist John Scofield and vibist Gary Burton; when he resided in New 
York in the late '70s, he appeared with the Brecker Brothers, drummer Tony 
Williams and others. Later, he recorded with guitarist Alan Holdsworth, drummer 
Bill Bruford, and under his own name, though his three late-'80s Passport jazz 
albums are all out of print. 
</P>
<P>
 Berlin -- who plays the Palladium electric bass by Peavey, an instrument he 
designed -- has a warm sound he couples with a very fluid technique. "I feel 
fortunate that I've come to a place where I can play anything that I can think 
of," Berlin says. Examples of his brilliance as a soloist are contained in 
"Great Moments in Jazz," published by Sher Music, which also includes written 
snippets of such notables as Charlie Parker, Sonny Rollins and Scofield and 
saxophonist Michael Brecker. 
</P>
<P>
 Jazz and jazz/rock are the music Berlin plays when he leads his own ensembles. 
"At Le Cafe, we're going to play bop all night, and I'm gonna play my heart 
out," he says, adding that his quartet will offer originals and such standards 
as Cole Porter's "What Is This Thing Called Love?" and Wayne Shorter's 
"Pinocchio." 
</P>
<P>
 "When I solo, and I play notes or ideas that I didn't expect, I feel like I'm 
in a flow, like I'm connected to something," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Berlin puts on a solid show, says Dale Jaffe, owner of Le Cafe. "A lot of 
times a bass player either is a good soloist or fits in well into an ensemble, 
but Jeff seems to do both," Jaffe says. WHERE AND WHEN  
</P>
<P>
 What: Jeff Berlin's quartet, with Ted Castelucci (guitar), Mitch Forman 
(keyboards) and Joel Taylor (drums).

BARGAINS / GERI COOK: STAR-QUALITY CLOTHING; * CELEBRITIES' DUDS CAN PERFORM IN 
YOUR CLOSET AFTER A VISIT TO CINEMA GLAMOUR SHOP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 We sometimes forget about the tried-and-true bargain sources in our search for 
the new. Such is the case with the Cinema Glamour Shop, where stars have been 
donating clothing for 72 years and where all the proceeds benefit the Motion 
Picture & Television Hospital and Country House in Woodland Hills. Volunteers 
staff the shop: Don't be surprised to see some faces from the silver screen 
among them. 
</P>
<P>
 This used celebrity-clothing store started the whole trend toward resale 
celebrity-clothing boutiques. Over the years, many of the biggest stars have 
contributed their apparel, shoes, hats and accessories to the shop, and many of 
Los Angeles' smartest shoppers have given a second life to clothes from the 
wardrobes of Burt Reynolds, Don Rickles, Bob Newhart, Julie Andrews, Elizabeth 
Taylor, Loni Anderson, Janet Leigh, Rhonda Fleming, Anne Jeffries, Betty White, 
Audrey Meadows and many others. 
</P>
<P>
 Since all of the inventory has been donated, the prices can be set very low, 
and there's no sales tax because of its nonprofit status. In the men's 
department, a like-new suit, 100% pure wool gabardine, with the Nordstrom label 
(size 36), was a remarkable $30. A Countess Mara plaid sport coat (size 42) was 
$40. In the designer collection of women's apparel, a handsome black knit suit 
from I. Magnin was $30, and a zippy brown leather suit by Kenneth Warren was 
$40. A very wearable classic suit (size 12) by Frederica, made in Italy to sell 
for around $800, was $35. A black silk Yves St. Laurent suit (size 5-6) was 
$50, down $450 from the original price. 
</P>
<P>
 To the left of the designer apparel area is the $1 to $5 Room, where you can 
go bananas. I picked up two nice big V-neck sweaters for $5 apiece and a 
worn-only-once pair of Ferragamo pumps for $5. 
</P>
<P>
 The inventory moves very fast here, and regulars stop at least once a month to 
check out new arrivals. This shop is not for trendy fashions, but rather for 
those who seek classic elegance in their attire. 
</P>
<P>
 In the very back, where the public is not invited, was a collection of 
performance gowns recently donated by Vicki Carr. None had been priced, and 
many will no doubt be saved for the yearly auction to be held Oct. 19 at the 
Regency Beverly Wilshire.

HE DOESN'T NEED A CRUTCH; * TENACIOUS DEGEN KEPPLER OVERCAME DRUGS AND THE LOSS 
OF A LIMB TO BECOME A BODYBUILDER AND SOUGHT-AFTER TRAINER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VINCE KOWALICK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 You can't miss Degen Keppler among the workout crowd at the Spectrum Club in 
Agoura Hills. He's the trainer with the jam-packed schedule, the Charles Atlas 
build and the artificial leg. 
</P>
<P>
 And a sense of humor. 
</P>
<P>
 "I definitely, well, limp to the beat of a different drummer," Keppler said. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Keppler -- call him a rebel without a pause -- has made remarkable 
professional strides solely on his ability to walk his talk. 
</P>
<P>
 At 38, Keppler, a former heroin addict turned workaholic, is among the 
unlikeliest of workout gurus. Despite never having been certified as a 
professional trainer, he has become one of the most successful and sought-after 
trainers in the Spectrum company, which also includes two clubs in Santa Monica 
and facilities in Century City, Culver City and Manhattan Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 For five consecutive months, Keppler has been selected trainer of the month at 
Agoura Hills. In January, Spectrum executives commended Keppler for setting 
company records for private training sales for a month ($10,346 in December) 
and a year ($47,734 in 1993). 
</P>
<P>
 His daily schedule typically includes about 12 one-hour sessions with clients 
who range from a 16-year-old high school soccer player to a retired aerospace 
executive. His training figures undoubtedly would be higher if only there were 
more hours in the day. 
</P>
<P>
 "He accommodates as many people as he can, but he has gotten to the point 
where he's full, and he has a waiting list," said Scott Reeves, fitness manager 
at the Agoura Hills club. "People see him on the floor training, and they come 
to him." 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Kerr, an Agoura Hills attorney, did exactly that in May after seeing the 
results other clients were getting under Keppler's tutelage. He remains one of 
Keppler's regulars. 
</P>
<P>
 "He makes you realize all the little details, all the little things you're 
doing wrong," Kerr said. "And he corrects them." 
</P>
<P>
 Since becoming a full-time trainer two years ago, Keppler, who stands 5-foot-6 
and weighs 175 pounds ("I'd be 15 pounds heavier with another leg"), has begun 
to compete as a bodybuilder with the Natural Physique Assn. of America, a 
fledgling organization based in Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been working out for 27 years," he said. "I've spent a lot of time and a 
lot of effort finding different exercises, finding which ones are most 
effective. I taught myself through years and years of practice." 
</P>
<P>
 Pretty ironic, considering Keppler unabashedly admits that he never will have 
what all bodybuilders painfully strive for: a perfect physique. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes I get in front of a mirror and I flex to see how I'm improving, and 
some people take that like I'm an egomaniac or something," Keppler said. "For 
God's sake, I've got one leg! How much of an Adonis can I possibly think I am?" 
</P>
<P>
 Eighteen years ago, Keppler lost his right leg below the knee in an accident 
involving a friend, a .44-caliber Magnum, and a hazy evening of drug and 
alcohol abuse. He has remained drug-free since undergoing rehabilitation in 
1977. 
</P>
<P>
 For 14 years, he was employed manufacturing prostheses, including his own.  
</P>
<P>
 He also worked as a handyman, and a job as a painter in 1991 led him to the 
Spectrum Club, then under construction. Keppler immediately decided that he 
wanted to be a trainer. He approached company executives "like a pit bull on a 
mailman's leg" and was hired, he says, because of his enthusiasm. 
</P>
<P>
 Personal trainers are not required by law to be certified by a fitness 
organization, but most are, Reeves said. Keppler was hired as a rare exception. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are some people who come in here with certification and they don't have 
any idea how to apply their knowledge," Reeves said. "Degen's lived it; he's 
practiced it. And that's why he is successful." 
</P>
<P>
 Club members consider Keppler an inspiration, Reeves said. He is approachable 
and easygoing. And not afraid to joke at his own expense, which he likes to do. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm the first person to tell somebody, 'Hey, we could make a great 
three-legged race team,' " Keppler said. "I can laugh at myself now. I couldn't 
always do that." WHERE TO GO

OUT OF THE BLUE; * VALLEY MEN PUBLISH NEWSLETTER FOR EX-IBM EMPLOYEES WHO HAVE 
HAD TO LET GO OF A WAY OF LIFE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICIA WARD BIEDERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Alexander Auerbach describes his new San Fernando Valley-based publication as 
"a product of Los Angeles traffic congestion." 
</P>
<P>
 There he was on the Ventura Freeway, inching toward home in Sherman Oaks from 
the West Valley. On "All Things Considered" -- National Public Radio's 
considerable contribution to American mental health -- a reporter was limning 
the expected impact of additional layoffs by troubled computer giant IBM. 
</P>
<P>
 A former reporter who once covered IBM for the Boston Globe and the Los 
Angeles Times, Auerbach remembers thinking that this was a group of people who 
would need special help adjusting to life after Big Blue. His idea: a 
publication for and by ex-IBMers. 
</P>
<P>
 "By Van Nuys Boulevard, I had the idea for the newsletter," said Auerbach, now 
a public relations consultant. "By Woodman, I had the title -- Out of the 
Blue." 
</P>
<P>
 The monthly newsletter made its debut in March, its appearance delayed a few 
weeks by the January quake. Auerbach, 50, is publisher. Editor is Rick Weiner, 
55, of Northridge, a 26-year veteran of Big Blue who left in 1993 when his job 
in corporate communications disappeared. The first issue, which featured a 
story on IBM's corporate health and an account of how one retiree is adjusting 
to life on an island off the North Carolina coast, was mailed to 5,000 former 
employees whose names are in the newsletter's computerized files. 
</P>
<P>
 Already substantial, the potential audience for the newsletter continues to 
grow. Once the most admired company in the world, IBM employed more than 
400,000 conservatively suited men and women in 1986. But since then, the 
faltering firm has eliminated 150,000 workers through early retirement, buyouts 
and layoffs. An additional 30,000 jobs will be phased out by the end of 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 As Auerbach and Weiner explain, losing their jobs was the last thing that most 
IBM employees expected. For most of its 70-year history, the company promised 
anyone who was initiated into its corporate culture a job for life. "IBM prided 
itself on not laying anybody off," said Weiner, who notes that this was true 
even during the Depression. Once a policy at IBM, lifetime employment "became a 
practice and then it became a tradition," he said. "Now it's a memory." 
</P>
<P>
 Many IBM employees were fanatical in their devotion to the company, which has 
made it that much harder to let go and start over. At one point in its early 
history, workers attended cohesion-building camps where they sang anthems about 
founder Thomas Watson. 
</P>
<P>
 These days, nobody's trilling "Thomas Watson is our inspiration / Head and 
soul of our splendid IBM / We are pledged to him throughout all nations / He's 
our president and most beloved man," as they did in 1933. But, according to 
Auerbach and Weiner, many former workers have a difficult time breaking the 
emotional ties that bind them to the company. 
</P>
<P>
 One reason, the men say, is that IBM had a unique culture. Big Blue was 
suffused with pride and professionalism, and people who made the cut knew what 
to wear (dark suits and white shirts), when and where to move, and even how to 
make an effective presentation -- lots of overhead projections were in order. 
As a result, IBM lingers in ex-employees' psyches even after they turn in their 
keys. "You don't divorce a mate and just forget about them," said Weiner. "A 
lot of people were married to IBM." 
</P>
<P>
 Weiner views himself as one of the lucky ones. In addition to his editing 
responsibilities, he has an ongoing consulting relationship with a large 
corporation in the Valley that he declines to name. "I haven't looked back," he 
said. "I'm having fun. I haven't had problems learning to walk again in the 
real world." 
</P>
<P>
 Others have been less fortunate. The first issue of Out of the Blue includes 
mini-profiles of three former employees whose reactions at leaving ranged from 
anger at the company that rejected them to an optimistic conviction that it was 
all for the best. It's clear from talking with many ex-IBMers that 
reconstructing their lives has been no small task, Auerbach says. 
</P>
<P>
 In some cases, entire communities have been transformed, notably the Hudson 
Valley towns outside New York City where the company had three major 
facilities. There, the incomes of former IBM families have plummeted and the 
demand for psychological services has soared. Last year, a Kingston, N. Y., dry 
cleaner, whose once profitable flood of dark suits and white shirts had slowed 
to a trickle, torched the family business in the wake of IBM's decline. 
</P>
<P>
 Out of the Blue has no official connection with IBM nor has the company 
endorsed it. But that doesn't make the newsletter anti-IBM, its creators say. 
"We don't regard this as an outlaw publication or an IBM-bashing publication in 
any way," Weiner said. "Our intent is to be beneficial, if not therapeutic," 
Auerbach said. Besides, he added, "they're a lot of really good IBM-bashers out 
there already." 
</P>
<P>
 IBM was -- and still is -- a company filled with talent, Auerbach and Weiner 
point out, and they hope to help the gifted people who once worked there get on 
with the rest of their lives. A "jobs board" and networking information are 
regular features of the newsletter. The vigor of the company is also a matter 
of continuing interest, especially in light of the number of former employees 
who exercised their option to buy IBM stock. 
</P>
<P>
 What happened at IBM wasn't an isolated event, Auerbach says. It's happening 
throughout white-collar America. Even as the economy recovers, there are fewer 
and fewer white-collar jobs in traditional workplaces. Wherever they once 
worked, Auerbach says, tomorrow's most contented workers may be those who 
create alternative ways to support and sustain themselves, alternatives that 
allow them to eliminate the long hours and other negative aspects of corporate 
culture. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be stressful," Auerbach said. However, he predicts that the 
future for employees who are cut loose from traditional workplaces could bring 
enormous rewards, including "the opportunity to lead a different kind of life."

RESTAURANT REVIEW; USING THEIR NOODLES; * THE PASTA SHOPPE IN MONTROSE SERVES 
UP TASTY ITALIAN DISHES AT BARGAIN PRICES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

Friday in Valley Life!

<TEXT>
<P>
 There's an endearing quality about the Pasta Shoppe's new branch in this 
quiet, hillside community. It's a quirky little joint; di rectly over the pasta 
counter hovers an enormous pastel yellow duct that could be mistaken for a 
bionic-sized piece of lemon rigatoni. The Shoppe offers a friendly welcome and 
not a whit of pretense. 
</P>
<P>
 For those unfamiliar with the original Pasta Shoppe in Los Feliz, here's the 
concept. Freshly made pasta (you see sheets of the stuff on trays as you walk 
in the front door) is sold in assorted varieties at about $4.25 a pound. It 
comes in a dozen flavors, such as plain, rosemary, spinach and sage, and in the 
shapes you know -- pappardelle , tagliatelle , fusilli and other marchers in 
the parade of Italian tongue twisters. You want sauces? The Pasta Shoppe sells 
them, too. 
</P>
<P>
 You can take everything home and cook it yourself, but I prefer to drive up 
the hill and let the kitchen do the work. Let me assure you, at around $5 a 
dish, it's a bargain. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't look for royal comforts at these prices, of course. The half-dozen 
tables are fashioned from cold stainless steel, and the chairs have hard wicker 
seats. The floor is hardwood, and the yellow walls are adorned only with a few 
large, rough-looking paintings of pastas. New Age rock is apt to be playing in 
the background, because the entire kitchen staff appears to be 
twenty-something. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm not the one to ask about pasta salads (I like my pasta hot, with no 
vinegar, thanks), although I'm told that the best one here is made with 
radiatore , sun-dried tomatoes, chopped basil leaves and Kalamata olives. I'm 
telling everybody to start, instead, with one of the terrific empanadas or a 
slice of the cafe's hearty torta rustica.  
</P>
<P>
 The empanadas are an unexpected Latin American touch -- flaky turnovers that 
come with a variety of fillings. The veal empanada is great, although perhaps a 
touch salty. The interior is a mixture of finely minced veal and olives; the 
outside is braided like Pippi Longstocking's hair. As for torta rustica , it's 
something like a thick savory pie with layers of fillings. My friends and I ate 
a slice that contained minced chicken, mozzarella mingled with cooked spinach 
and chopped tomatoes, all in a doughy crust you could pull apart like a sticky 
bun. 
</P>
<P>
 The pasta doughs are good, although none of them quite jumps out at you, 
flavor-wise. The kitchen will cook them al dente , of course. (Incidentally, if 
you order a pasta, you'll get a bonus: a basket of terrific focaccia bread 
topped with grilled onions.) 
</P>
<P>
 You're pretty much on your own in choosing among the 600-odd possible 
combinations of sauces and pasta flavors and shapes. The menu makes a scant six 
suggestions, such as garlic pappardelle with meat sauce, lemon fettuccine with 
cream of sage sauce and chicken ravioli. Every one we tasted was pleasant. 
</P>
<P>
 Pappardelle are wide, flat noodles, and the recommended meat sauce is a 
delicate veal ragu that I'd say rivals that of most accomplished pasterias. On 
the other hand, lemon fettuccine with the suggested sage sauce would be a 
disappointment if you were expecting to taste either lemon or sage distinctly, 
although it is a good, creamy little pasta dish. My money's on the chicken 
ravioli, which have a pleasant (unannounced) bit of cheese in the dough. I 
recommend ordering the grainy pesto sauce to go with it. 
</P>
<P>
 For a small place, the Pasta Shoppe has a surprisingly large menu, even 
outside all the pasta combinations. There's always a good house soup such as 
minestrone or lentil on hand, and there are grilled sandwiches such as alla 
Lombarda , crackling bread filled with marinated peppers, grilled onions and 
melted mozzarella. WHERE AND WHEN

MIKE PENNER: HIS LIFE IS ONE OF MILESTONES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE PENNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Old Man Twin is expecting twins. That's the off-the-field update on Dave 
Winfield. Wife Tonya got the news late last month, meaning that some time this 
November, Winfield should complete what is quite possibly an unprecedented life 
cycle. 
</P>
<P>
 From Padre to Twin to padre of twins. 
</P>
<P>
 "Great day to have two," Dave can tell Tonya on the way to the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 On the field, the word on Winfield is: It's always something. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday night, Winfield hit a home run off Mark Langston. It was the 300th of 
his American League career. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday afternoon, Winfield hit two doubles off Chuck Finley. These moved him 
to within one of Willie Mays on the all-time doubles list and past Harmon 
Killebrew on something known as the all-time total-bases-coming-on-long-hits 
list -- which, best I can tell, is either an obscure compendium of bases 
amassed on doubles, triples and home runs or a new rotisserie category. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't really keep track of 'em," Winfield frankly admitted, "but on a 
day-to-day basis, (total bases coming on long hits) play a key part in breaking 
a game open." 
</P>
<P>
 Hard to argue with that. 
</P>
<P>
 Every time Winfield puts bat to ball these days, he's breaking something, 
surpassing someone or triggering another countdown. 
</P>
<P>
 Winfield has 3,018 hits. With 140 more this season, he can pass Lou Brock, Rod 
Carew, Cap Anson, Robin Yount, Paul Waner and George Brett to move into 11th 
place. 
</P>
<P>
 Winfield has 1,790 RBIs. With 72 more this season, he passes Frank Robinson, 
Al Simmons, Ted Williams, Carl Yastrzemski and Mel Ott to move into eighth 
place. 
</P>
<P>
 Winfield has 454 home runs. With 22 more this season, he passes Willie 
Stargell and Stan Musial, takes over 16th place and places magic number 500 so 
tantalizingly close -- only 24 to go -- that he may try to squeeze out another 
season in 1995, at age 43, if the Twins want him to or not. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday afternoon, invigorated by three RBIs and a 7-4 victory over the 
Angels, Winfield sounded like a man who wasn't planning on leaving any time 
soon. 
</P>
<P>
 "I enjoy myself," Winfield said, stretched out in a folding chair in front of 
his red-white-and-blue locker stall. "It's a great job. You work hard, you fool 
around with the guys, you stay young. It's OK." 
</P>
<P>
 But the drudgery, the schlepping from plane to hotel to ballpark, the 0-for-3s 
followed by 0-for-4s. Winfield has done the drill for more than 21 years, 
nearly as long as some of his current teammates have been on earth. One, 
outfielder Rich Becker, was born 16 months before Winfield made his big league 
debut with San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 When in a life does it come time to try something new, if only to break the 
monotony? 
</P>
<P>
 "This might seem like the same thing every day," Winfield said, "but it's also 
different every day. It's the same -- and it's different. It keeps you guessing 
every day. 
</P>
<P>
 "The people around me enjoy that I do it. When I travel, it brings family and 
friends together, and we have a good time. When you add it up, you probably 
couldn't find any other work or occupation that would allow you to carry on 
with this lifestyle." 
</P>
<P>
 Winfield has been doing this for so long, and for so many employers, that he 
refers to his two-year stint with the Angels, 1990-91, as "just a stopover." 
Beating the Angels today means no more to him than beating the Athletics 
tomorrow. 
</P>
<P>
 "That team has turned over. It's totally different now," he said. "There's 
only a few guys I know over there. Harold Reynolds. Chili. Finley. Langston. I 
know Rex Hudler." 
</P>
<P>
 Older guys. And this Angel team has gone young. Winfield can remember playing 
against Tony Perez. Thursday, he found himself playing against Tony Perez's 
son, Angel first baseman Eduardo. 
</P>
<P>
 The home team has changed on him, too. Native Minnesotan son Winfield joined 
the Twins two years after their world championship run was done, landing 
smack-dab in the middle of a youth movement, in the middle of non-contention. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is pleasant," is how Winfield refers to his Minneapolis stop, his fifth 
stop, but then he can say that because he got his with Toronto in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "Toronto was the most fun," he said, "because we had a great team. I was 
playing with older, experienced guys -- just a lot of experienced veterans who 
knew what they were doing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Toronto was the only time in my career where I could say at the start of a 
season, 'This is the best talent in baseball.' I'd look at the guy to my left, 
I'd look at the guy to my right and I'd say, 'The opposition is in trouble.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The task at hand has been downscaled. Now, Winfield plays to keep playing. The 
Twins would like him to produce bigger numbers than the 21 home runs, 76 RBIs 
and .271 average he managed in '93. If he wants to stay, he must oblige them -- 
and Winfield admits the brass ring of 500 home runs has caught his eye. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be great," he said. "I know very few people have done it and it's 
something I never even thought about accomplishing when I started playing. If 
it happens here, it happens here." 
</P>
<P>
 And if not? 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, I'm certainly not looking to leave. But . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 Winfield would then pack up his bats and see if anyone's in the market to rent 
a Hall of Fame moment. Until then, he hangs around the clubhouse and counsels 
the youngsters, such as Kirby Puckett, who has closed, slowly, to within one 
hit of 2,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's feeling it a little now, but as soon as he gets 2,000, it'll be like 
water off a duck's back," Winfield said. "Then things will be back to normal." 
</P>
<P>
 Give Puckett a break, Winfield is saying. The kid's only 33.

JIM MURRAY: THE MASTERS; WILD DAY IS SEVE HEAVEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM MURRAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was the Masters all right. One guy took a 10 on a hole. Steve Elkington 
opened with a seven on his way to an 81. Tom Watson was leading the tournament 
at four under par till he came to the 15th, where he took an eight. Golfers 
call that a "snowman." Abominable. John Daly had a six. Greg Norman went from 
par to three under, then back to par, whereupon he went eagle-birdie on the 
13th and 14th, hit it in the water on the 15th, and you had a picture of Greg 
standing in line at Disney World, saying, "What time's the next 
roller-coaster?" 
</P>
<P>
 It's not a tournament, it's an ambush. A mass execution. The Augusta National 
without a blade of rough in it is making golf pay for its sins. In poor light, 
it looks like Custer's Last Stand. The course is taking no prisoners.  
</P>
<P>
 In ordinary tournaments, guys who shoot one under par seldom get asked into 
the post-round interview room. At the Masters, they almost get a ticker-tape 
parade. 
</P>
<P>
 Naturally, the leader board is peppered with foreigners. Fulton Allem from 
South Africa is tied with Tom Kite for second. A Fiji-an, no less, is not far 
behind. This tournament is as hospitable to the foreign-born as Ellis Island.  
</P>
<P>
 But if it has gone out of its way to smother careers, it seemed in one case to 
be trying to make it up to golf by reviving the career of one of its most 
valuable marquee names. It seemed to salute the return of the happy hidalgo, 
Don Severiano Ballesteros.  
</P>
<P>
 Severiano Ballesteros was as exciting a presence on the golf scene as a 
runaway bull. He galvanized British golf when he first appeared on its hallowed 
courses.  
</P>
<P>
 Golfers are not supposed to come out of Spain, bullfighters are. And Seve 
Ballesteros would have looked good in a suit of lights and a muleta and sword. 
He had the drop-dead good looks of a Latin lover. He could have made a rich 
gigolo.  
</P>
<P>
 He was as good for golf as the steel shaft. There wasn't a more exhilarating 
sight and sound on any fairway than that of Seve on the spoor of first money in 
a British Open. Or any other tournament.  
</P>
<P>
 No one ever figured out how you learn to play birdie golf in the north of 
Spain. You get golfers out of West Texas, Brigham Young and Southern 
California, and they're all blond and blue-eyed and deliberate in their moves. 
The game was invented in Scotland and was played by the kind of men who made 
watches or cut diamonds, not fiery young Spaniards.  
</P>
<P>
 So they thought this young swashbuckling senor from Santander would be like 
that other Spanish armada and would crash and burn on the shores of Britain. 
The first time he saw the forbidding dunes of St. Andrews and Lytham & St. 
Anne's, he would chuck it all and go back to a bullring.  
</P>
<P>
 First of all, he seemed to have the wrong temperament. He was full of passion 
and fire and played the game with the verve and panache of a guy serenading a 
senorita under a balcony.  
</P>
<P>
 He won the British Open out of a parking lot. He was daring, reckless, 
heedless. He, so to speak, went over the horns to slay the course. Not for Seve 
the tight-lipped, tension-ridden, hold-your-breath mental game of the masters. 
Seve was like a guy riding a shark.  
</P>
<P>
 He had a positive genius for inventing shots. He was utterly fearless. Where a 
more contemplative golfer would accept a shot that was hit behind trees, under 
the debris of coke bottles, tree limbs, leaf compost or even parked cars and 
would hit it safely back on the fairway, Seve went for the miracle. And the 
pin. For Seve, the fairway was nice but not necessary.  
</P>
<P>
 They thought this temperamental Iberian should have taken up the tango and 
that the canny U.K. professionals would soon have taught him the game was much 
tougher than he supposed.  
</P>
<P>
 Seve ignored them. He shocked the world when he won a British Open at 22. You 
would have thought he sank the fleet at Scapa Flow. He won Dutch Opens and 
French Opens. He was the best player in Europe.  
</P>
<P>
 But they said it wouldn't play in America. After all, the best players in the 
world roamed there. They regularly beat back the Brits, even crossed the pond 
to win their Open whenever they felt like it. Seve would be in over his head 
with these battle-hardened Yanks who teed it up in the toughest test of golf in 
the world, the American tour.  
</P>
<P>
 But in 1978, Seve had won the Greensboro Open. In 1980, at 23, he won the 
Masters.  
</P>
<P>
 It was the way he won it that awed the Yanks. It was like the Dempsey-Firpo 
fight. But Seve kept getting off the floor to floor the course.  
</P>
<P>
 Three years later, Seve won the Masters again. And again it was a suspense 
movie. He had a 10-shot lead going into Amen Corner -- Nos. 11, 12 and 13. He 
had a four-shot lead coming off that corner.  
</P>
<P>
 It was Saturday afternoon serial stuff. Seve kept escaping the tracks just 
before the train bore down on him. He was Houdini escaping chained trunks under 
water. Watching Seve play golf was like watching a guy swim through alligators. 
 
</P>
<P>
 He won two Masters, was in a playoff for another and finished second two other 
times. Hogan never played it any better.  
</P>
<P>
 Foreigners have begun to win the Masters as often as they stage it. But Seve 
was the one who showed the way. He won six times on the U.S. tour in all, which 
is a record for the European contingent.  
</P>
<P>
 Seve's career took a nosedive in recent years. The wise guys said he finally 
found out you can't keep winning from the parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, Seve came to this year's Masters and showed he was only 37 and still 
inventive. He went out and shot a two-under-par 70 Thursday, a gutsy, typical 
Ballesteros round in which he hit only six greens all day. The fourth hole was 
vintage Seve. On the right of that par-three green with a sidehill lie and no 
real chance to aim at the pin, Seve reached into the hat again and pulled out 
the rabbit, a shot that his playing partner, Raymond Floyd, called "the 
greatest par I have ever seen in my life." 
</P>
<P>
 Seve was off line in jail on this 205-yard hole with the pin cut into the neck 
of the green with barely five feet on each side and a yawning bunker alongside. 
Somehow, Ballesteros hit a shot that seemed to go straight up in the air about 
10 stories high. It came down five feet from the hole. It was like hitting a 
ball up an elevator shaft not touching any wall and dropping onto a 
handkerchief.  
</P>
<P>
 It was a prickly Ballesteros who came into the press interview room later. He 
seemed to resent the fact he hadn't been asked there of late. No, he didn't 
want to talk about negative things. "Why can't we talk about the fact I won the 
Masters twice and was second twice and in a playoff a third time?" he 
complained.  
</P>
<P>
 Fair enough. And if he wants to win it a third time, it will be all right with 
golf. They won't even consider it a foreigner winning here. The dashing 
Spaniard is a citizen of the world. He even looks good in a green coat. And all 
golf hopes he can invent a way to get a third one.

MIKE DOWNEY: THIS KIND OF TABASCO HAS LEFT FEW EYES DRY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE DOWNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One of these days, I am going to write a children's book or a G-rated movie 
for the whole family because I already have most of the story and all I need 
now is an ending. I am going to write it about Tabasco Cat. 
</P>
<P>
 Somebody else can do Tonya Harding or Joey Buttafuoco. I like this one better. 
It has plenty of action and an innocent victim of sudden violence. But it's a 
much nicer story with much nicer people. 
</P>
<P>
 Tabasco Cat is not a cat. He is a horse, a 3-year-old chestnut. A few weeks 
from now, the adventure of Tabasco Cat is going to come to a dramatic climax 
when he runs in the Kentucky Derby, the most thrilling 2 minutes in sports. 
Before that happens, he can be seen Saturday in the $500,000 Santa Anita Derby, 
at the track where this horse's compelling tale began. 
</P>
<P>
 I swear, "The Black Stallion" has nothing on this. 
</P>
<P>
 It was only 10 days before last Christmas when the colt got loose in the 
stable area of Santa Anita and began to run wild. One of his trainers, Jeff 
Lukas, planted himself in Tabasco Cat's path, hoping to slow the horse down. At 
full gallop, Tabasco Cat ran him down. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff ended up in a coma. He lingered for more than two months at Huntington 
Memorial Hospital in Pasadena, eventually regaining his consciousness, his 
strength and some of his memory. He is now undergoing therapy at a 
rehabilitation center in Pomona and is making a splendid recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 In all my years of writing, I have never gotten a more touching response to a 
story than to the one I did about Jeff's accident. The image of Jeff's 
adolescent son, Brady, speaking into a tape recorder at Christmas and then 
having the tapes played beside his dad's ear, while Jeff remained in his coma, 
seemed to catch hundreds of people right in the heart. His father's recovery 
turned out to be the very best Christmas present a boy could get, just as it 
was for Jeff's own dad, Wayne Lukas, one of racing's top trainers. 
</P>
<P>
 As for Tabasco Cat, well, who cared if he ever ran again? 
</P>
<P>
 Ah, but this was not the end of the story. People did care. The Lukas family 
still cared. So did William T. Young, 75, the Kentucky peanut-butter baron (his 
company produced Jif) who serves on the board of directors at Churchill Downs 
and also happens to be the co-owner of Tabasco Cat, along with David P. 
Reynolds, 78, chairman emeritus of a company that deals in aluminum. 
</P>
<P>
 On Jan. 22, five weeks after the accident, Tabasco Cat was entered in a stakes 
race at Bay Meadows. He won. Then he ran at Santa Anita in the March 6 San 
Rafael Stakes. He won again, leading virtually from start to finish. It was the 
colt's fifth victory in his last six races, the only disappointment being a 
third-place finish at the Breeders' Cup last November. 
</P>
<P>
 Wayne Lukas had known all along he had a pretty good horse. But he never 
guessed it would be this good. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, he says, if you take the starting field for Saturday's race and add maybe 
a couple of other horses to it -- say, Holy Bull and Valiant Nature -- you 
could throw a rope over them as the favorites for the May 7 Kentucky Derby. 
</P>
<P>
 "And I hesitate to say it, but this horse might be our best chance ever," 
Lukas says, looking forward to another shot at a horseshoe of roses at 
Churchill Downs. "He's got the style, he's got the speed and he's probably the 
most tactical horse out there running today. What can I say? He's a pretty damn 
versatile horse. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's got all this energy. I keep having him doing more and more and more, but 
I still can't find his bottom. His energy just seems endless. I had him gallop 
two miles, and he bucked the exercise rider. Not out of meanness, just feeling 
good. He comes to play, this horse." 
</P>
<P>
 This horse who nearly killed his son. 
</P>
<P>
 That, to me, is what makes this story all the more remarkable. The Lukas 
family cares for and cares about the horse that ran Jeff down. Jeff himself is 
taking calls at his rehab center, giving advice to Tabasco Cat's handlers. 
</P>
<P>
 Wayne Lukas says: "This thing with Jeff and the horse's success, we're trying 
to keep the two things separate. And yet there obviously is a story here. 
</P>
<P>
 "What makes it doubly difficult now is not having Jeff here with me. Every 
spring, when the big races come around, your world suddenly becomes one big 
glass house. I'm used to that. Like when we had Winning Colors, there was so 
much extra attention down in Kentucky because of her being a filly. Jeff would 
always say something like, 'You go take care of all the other stuff and don't 
worry, I'll take care of the filly.' Only now, Jeff's not here. There's so much 
to do and so much emotional interest in this horse now, I'm worried about being 
a little overwhelmed." 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Lukas has regained most of his long-term memory, but still has blockage 
of more recent events. He does not remember being struck by Tabasco Cat, and 
doctors doubt he ever will. 
</P>
<P>
 Whenever anyone mentions that this was the horse that ran him down, Jeff's 
response is, "That's what they tell me." 
</P>
<P>
 No hard feelings, then. 
</P>
<P>
 Should this turn out to be the horse of his that wins a Kentucky Derby, the 
way Wayne Lukas looks at it, it will serve to prove only one thing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Truth really is stranger than fiction," he says. Santa Anita Derby 
</P>

 April didn't come in like a lion or a lamb in the Eastern United States 20 
years ago, but blew in with Ruthian gusto, as if presaging the ensuing 
tumultuous events. 
</P>
<P>
 On April 3, 1974, a series of wicked tornadoes touched down in the Cincinnati 
area. Hail the size of tennis balls pelted traffic on Interstate 75. The small 
town of Xenia, Ohio, an hour or so north, nearly disappeared, as did several 
neighborhoods of Cincinnati itself. 
</P>
<P>
 On the heels of the twisters, Hank Aaron and the Atlanta Braves blew into the 
city for the next day's baseball opener, trailing a media cyclone

<P>
 that cut a swath the length of the baseball world, from the United States to 
Latin America to Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 Aaron was one home run away from tying Babe Ruth's career record of 714, one 
of sport's magical numbers. The countdown had been on hold since the previous 
October, when the 39-year-old Aaron finished fast, hitting his 40th homer of 
the season -- No. 713 -- in Houston on the final Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 The media and publicity crush -- a virtual caravan had begun traveling with 
the Braves late in the '73 season -- was such that Aaron often had to stay 
separately from his teammates, check into different hotels under assumed names 
and generally live like a rock star, though he remained largely the same quiet, 
unassuming man he had been when he joined the Milwaukee Braves as a skinny 
20-year-old in 1954. 
</P>
<P>
 Remarkably, Aaron was outwardly unfazed by the hubbub, from tornadoes to media 
to racist hate mail. But his actions touched off storms of controversy 
throughout the week leading up to the record. 
</P>
<P>
 "He handled it better than everybody. He was amazing," Eddie Mathews recalled 
from his Del Mar home. Mathews, who had paired with Aaron to become the most 
prolific home-run hitting teammates in baseball annals, was the Braves' manager 
as Aaron approached the mark. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 Aaron trivia: Starting late in the 1973 season, umpires used different 
baseballs for Aaron's at-bats, with special stamps (visible under UV light) so 
fans -- or even players -- couldn't claim to have a historic ball; advertisers 
from as far away as South America were offering $25,000 for No. 715.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday, April 4, dawned sunny and breezy, thankfully calm of tornadoes. Vice 
President Gerald Ford was on hand for the game, after a helicopter tour of the 
remains of Xenia. The tornadoes dominated the day's headlines. They wouldn't 
for long. 
</P>
<P>
 Aaron, recently turned 40, wanted to set the record in Atlanta. He was going 
to sit out the opening three-game series at Cincinnati, but at the urging of 
major league baseball, he started the opener against right-hander Jack 
Billingham, who had slept on the floor while twisters tore through his 
neighborhood. Aaron didn't keep people in suspense long. With two on in the 
first inning, Aaron sent homer No. 714 on a low trajectory over the left-field 
fence. 
</P>
<P>
 It was his first swing of the season. Left fielder Pete Rose watched it sail 
over the wall into an area below the permanent stands, where it was retrieved 
by a policeman. The game was stopped, Aaron made a brief speech and waved. 
Billingham then retired the side. In the dugout after the first inning, 
Billingham saw teammates looking at him pensively. "Didn't waste any time, did 
I?" he commented. 
</P>
<P>
 Aaron's next at-bats were uneventful, and the Reds came back to win, 7-6. 
</P>
<P>
 That home run would make Mathews' job tougher. Friday, April 5, was an 
off-day. Before Saturday's game, Mathews announced that Aaron would sit out the 
games Saturday and Sunday; the Braves thought Cincinnati had gotten its fair 
share of him. Atlanta had drawn poorly the previous two seasons, had an 11-game 
home stand coming and envisioned sellouts. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was getting some miles on him, it wasn't like he was going to play every 
day," Mathews said of Aaron, who eventually played in 112 games that season. 
But baseball had other ideas -- best interests of the game, fielding your most 
competitive team, etc. Commissioner Bowie Kuhn told the Braves to play Aaron. 
Mathews got his hackles up and kept Aaron on the bench Saturday against young 
fireballer Don Gullett, saying: "Right or wrong, this is Eddie Mathews' 
decision." 
</P>
<P>
 News conferences occurred hourly. Influential New York columnists Red Smith 
and Dick Young took the Braves to task. The Atlanta media hotly told these 
carpetbaggers to butt out. Kuhn phoned. Mathews recalled: "He made it clear 
there were going to be repercussions. He said, 'I'm going to suspend you, the 
general manager, the owner and everybody in the Atlanta front office.' So I 
played him Sunday." 
</P>
<P>
 The finale of the series proved anticlimactic, even embarrassing. Aaron struck 
out twice and grounded out weakly against Clay Kirby, misplayed a fly ball in 
left field and was replaced by Ralph Garr in the seventh inning. The caravan 
packed up and moved to Atlanta for a home stand starting against the Dodgers on 
Monday, April 8. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dodgers arrived in town at 1:30 a.m. Believe it or not, there were tornado 
warnings in Atlanta, but the threat subsided for that night's game. Dodger 
left-hander Al Downing was the scheduled starter. 
</P>
<P>
 Kuhn, as vilified as Gen. Sherman in Atlanta, was in Cleveland addressing a 
banquet that night. He feared that his presence in Atlanta might detract from 
the event and sent assistant Monte Irvin in his place. 
</P>
<P>
 A national TV audience was tuned in. There was a palpable air of expectation 
in Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium. The sellout crowd was treated to a pregame 
ceremony honoring Aaron. A soft drizzle began. In the second inning, Aaron 
walked without offering at any of the five pitches. 
</P>
<P>
 In the fourth, Aaron came to bat with Darrell Evans on first base. Downing 
threw a changeup for a ball. His second pitch, at 9:07 p.m., was a fastball 
that was supposed to tail but didn't. With his first home-field swing of the 
season, Aaron sent the ball over the left-field fence into the Brave bullpen, 
where pitcher Tom House caught it. Dodger left fielder Bill Buckner, who had 
discussed splitting the reward with center fielder Jim Wynn, tried to scramble 
up the wire fence, but saw House glove it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our first game in Atlanta, I'll be darned if he doesn't hit the homer," 
Mathews remembered with a laugh. "About half the stadium got up and left in the 
middle of the game. If he hadn't hit it (right away), we'd have had 55,000 
every game." 
</P>
<P>
 Aaron was swamped at home plate by teammates and a few fans who made their way 
onto the field while he was circling the bases. His parents were brought down 
from the stands. 
</P>
<P>
 House, approaching the mob to present the historic ball to Aaron, was shocked 
to see the new home run king fighting back tears as he hugged his mother. 
"Suddenly, I saw what many people have never been able to see in him -- deep 
emotion," House said later. "I looked, and he had tears hanging on his lids. I 
could hardly believe it. I put the ball in his hand. He said, 'Thanks, kid,' 
and touched me on the shoulder." 
</P>
<P>
 A few minutes later, Aaron took a congratulatory call in Mathews' office from 
President Nixon. He expressed relief, saying it felt like "the weight of a 
stove" was off his shoulders. 
</P>
<P>
 Downing had control problems after the ceremony, walked two batters and was 
taken out of the game by Manager Walter Alston. A cab was called, and Downing 
left the stadium. With good cheer that has never failed him, he told the one 
reporter who tracked him down before he left: "I'm more concerned about my next 
start. This thing is over. It's history. It won't bother me." 
</P>
<P>
 Downing has joined Tracy Stallard, Tom Zachary, Dennis Eckersley and a select 
few other pitchers remembered as the answers to home run trivia. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Aaron trivia: Steve Garvey was the first baseman for two of the most 
documented hits in baseball history: Aaron's 715th homer and Rose's 4,192nd 
hit, which broke Ty Cobb's career record. Garvey was with the Padres for Rose's 
hit and was the first player to greet him. He apparently had no plan to cop a 
souvenir. If Aaron had caught Ruth at the end of the '73 season, Houston first 
baseman Lee May told George Plimpton he had planned to bear-hug Aaron as he 
rounded the bag -- and grab his batting helmet. He'd planned to keep it in his 
den and display it: "There it is, the helmet Bad Henry wore when he hit 714."  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty years later, no one has approached Aaron's final total of 755, and 
there's nobody on the horizon. Check back in 15 or 16 years to see if Ken 
Griffey Jr. or Juan Gonzalez or Frank Thomas mounted an assault. 
</P>
<P>
 But in some ways, Aaron never supplanted Ruth, which he readily admits. 
"Somebody can come along and hit 800 home runs, and it's never going to mean as 
much as Babe Ruth's record," he said recently. "Babe Ruth's homers are always 
going to be legend." 
</P>
<P>
 Did Mathews ever have the sudden realization that Aaron might be the one to 
finally overhaul Ruth? "We didn't look at things like that," Mathews said, 
adding: "He was the best player I've seen, all-around. He went out there every 
year to play every game." 
</P>
<P>
 Two decades later, there's a radical thought.

ONE-TIME PITCHING PRODIGY PASSES ON TIPS TO NEXT GENERATION; HIGH SCHOOL 
BASEBALL: FULLERTON ACE RYAN GOLISANO IS BEING TUTORED BY JIM DERRINGTON, THE 
YOUNGEST PITCHER TO START A MAJOR LEAGUE GAME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 One was rapping grounders during practice. The other shagged the return 
throws. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Derrington, the youngest pitcher to start a major league baseball game, 
hit the grounders. Now 54, with his career behind him, he spends his free time 
working as an unpaid assistant coach at Fullerton High School. 
</P>
<P>
 Ryan Golisano, who would like to pitch in the major leagues, caught the 
throws. At 16, with his career ahead of him, he spends as much time as possible 
with Derrington, sopping up that knowledge. 
</P>
<P>
 The has-been and the wannabe? 
</P>
<P>
 "Ryan's success has a lot to do with the work Jim has put in," Fullerton Coach 
Dolf Hes said. "Every time Ryan pitches, Jim is in his back pocket. It's been 
the two of them together." 
</P>
<P>
 The tandem has been unbeatable this season. Golisano is 7-0 with a 1.73 
earned-run average. He has struck out 46 in 36 1/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
 Those are numbers that make Derrington beam with the prospect of Golisano's 
prospects. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's not even close to what he will be physically," Derrington said. "He's 
still growing. It's hard to say how far he can go." 
</P>
<P>
 If Golisano is going to get better, then Freeway League coaches must certainly 
be happy he's a senior. Already, he's a handful. 
</P>
<P>
 The Indians are 12-2 and 4-0 in league play. They are alone in first place, 
with a great deal of the credit going to Golisano. He has won three of the 
team's league games. 
</P>
<P>
 "Golisano can dominate a game," Troy Coach Dane Ilertsen said. "When he's on, 
he's tough to hit." 
</P>
<P>
 Troy found that out Wednesday. Golisano struck out six and gave up only one 
earned run in a 7-3 victory over the Warriors. 
</P>
<P>
 Golisano did it solely with his fast ball. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had no curveball today, but the fastball was right," Golisano said. 
</P>
<P>
 And when the fastball is right . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "If I feel it in the bullpen, I can't wait to get out there," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 That confidence has been developed through two-plus seasons under Derrington's 
tutelage. 
</P>
<P>
 Golisano transferred from Sonora after his freshman year after his parents 
divorced. He also played basketball, so he didn't start working out with the 
Fullerton baseball team until late February. 
</P>
<P>
 It didn't take long for him to make an impression. 
</P>
<P>
 "You could tell he had physical ability," Derrington said. "It was just a 
matter of refining it." 
</P>
<P>
 Golisano was 16, the same age that Derrington was when he became the youngest 
pitcher to start a major league game. Derrington got a $65,000 bonus to sign 
with the Chicago White Sox in 1956. He started against the Kansas City 
Athletics in 1956, giving up seven runs in six innings in a 7-6 loss. 
</P>
<P>
 Derrington was with the White Sox in 1957, appearing in 20 games and finishing 
with a 0-1 record. He then spent five years in the minor leagues and his 
baseball career was over when he was 22. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's always telling me about the longest home runs he gave up," Golisano 
said. "He says, 'Never hang a slider. Hanging sliders go the farthest.' " 
</P>
<P>
 But Derrington, a produce broker in Anaheim, has done more than wax nostalgic. 
He tinkered with Golisano's pitching motion and taught him how to pitch. 
</P>
<P>
 Derrington, who has been a volunteer coach at Fullerton the last three 
seasons, has put in extra time with Golisano and it has paid off. 
</P>
<P>
 He has been a key pitcher for the Indians since his sophomore season. He 
pitched 6 1/3 innings, giving up one run and three hits, against Sonora in his 
first varsity start. Golisano was the No. 2 starter on a team that won the 
Freeway League championship. 
</P>
<P>
 Golisano went eight innings to beat Sunny Hills, 4-1, which clinched a tie for 
the league title. 
</P>
<P>
 The Indians struggled last season, winning only three league games. But 
Golisano was 4-6, including a two-hitter against La Habra. 
</P>
<P>
 Looking over his shoulder was Derrington. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's really taught me the mental part of the game," Golisano said. "I use to 
just throw. Now I think about location and try to be smart. I don't throw 0-2 
pitches right down the middle." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Derrington: "Ryan is mentally tough. He doesn't get flustered. If you 
beat him today, you're still going to have to beat him tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
 No one has beaten him so far this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Golisano has gotten stronger as the season has progressed. He opened league 
play by striking out 12 in a 9-2 victory over Sunny Hills, a game that was 
called after six innings because of darkness. 
</P>
<P>
 Each game he pitches attracts more scouts, many of whom played with 
Derrington, who has become Golisano's pitch man. 
</P>
<P>
 "I keep telling them that this kid hasn't matured yet," Derrington said. 
"These guys are looking for potential and Ryan has a bunch of it. He's 
definitely a prospect." 
</P>
<P>
 It takes one to know one.

CHERYL MILLER'S LATEST SQUABBLE: PARKING AND BARKING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WENDY WITHERSPOON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Cheryl Miller has again found herself at the center of a dispute -- this time 
at home. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller, who replaced Marianne Stanley as USC women's basketball coach this 
season amid controversy, appeared in Los Angeles Superior Court on Thursday to 
try to solve a dispute with her Hollywood neighbor, Dino Sanchez, about two 
matters -- parking and dogs barking. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller filed a request for a restraining order against Sanchez last month to 
prevent him from continuing to park in a way that, she claims, blocks entering 
and exiting from her driveway. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanchez responded with a request for a restraining order against Miller, 
saying her claim about parking was made in retaliation for letters he has sent 
to the L.A. Dept. of Animal Regulation about what he says is incessant barking 
by her three dogs. 
</P>
<P>
 Each also claims to have received threatening phone calls from the other. 
</P>
<P>
 Commissioner William Allen issued an injunction Thursday restraining each 
party from annoying or harassing the other. Further, Allen ordered that Sanchez 
must make reasonable attempts not to interfere with Miller's access to her 
driveway. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller said: "I don't have a problem with anybody (else) in the neighborhood, 
and for this to go on, I think it's unfortunate." 
</P>
<P>
 Sanchez said the barking of Miller's three dogs is unbearable. 
</P>
<P>
 The next step is for the Dept. of Animal Regulation to schedule a hearing, 
during which a city-appointed examiner will take further steps to resolve the 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
 But Sanchez, 57, does not expect it will be easy, saying: "This is a 
basketball game to her, a game. She thinks she can intimidate me." 
</P>
<P>
 Stanley filed a gender-equity suit against the university after a contract 
dispute last summer. USC allowed Stanley's contract to expire. Many women's 
basketball coaches supported Stanley in her fight against USC and have 
criticized Miller for taking the job.

RUNNING FROM TROUBLE; LAPD'S ROSA MALAN ENABLES KIDS AT RISK TO GET ON RIGHT 
TRACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IRENE GARCIA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rosa Malan used to chase gangbangers. Now she runs with children in an effort 
to prevent them from joining gangs. 
</P>
<P>
 A police officer in the Valley's Devonshire Division, Malan heads Jeopardy, an 
outreach program that targets youths at high risk of gang involvement. 
</P>
<P>
 "It works," said Malan, 34, a 10-year member of the Los Angeles Police 
Department. "We have kids on probation, with robbery cases pending, that have 
straightened out. The ones that have dropped out of the program are in custody 
now or have dropped out of school. With proper direction and discipline, these 
kids can do great." 
</P>
<P>
 With Malan, affectionately called "Mama Rosa" by the children, providing that 
direction, Jeopardy has steered the lives of its participants out of harm's way 
and into a serious athletic endeavor -- running. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1993 members of Jeopardy participated in 12 races covering a total of 107 
miles. At last month's Los Angeles Marathon, 38 of 39 runners from the Jeopardy 
program finished the 26.2-mile course. It marked the second marathon finish for 
19 of them. Twenty were younger than 14. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year 41 of 42 runners from Jeopardy finished the L.A. Marathon. Malan ran 
with her group both years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I keep them going," she said. "I was there to make sure they didn't quit. It 
was a mommy thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Eight-year-old Ivan Zepeda was the group's youngest 1994 L.A. Marathon 
finisher. It took him almost eight hours, but he never stopped. Nine-year-old 
Eduardo Zendejas finished in 7 hours 15 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was exhausted and excited," Zendejas said. "This is hard, but it's so much 
fun." 
</P>
<P>
 Pepe Martinez, 13, improved his time from 6:20 in '93 to 5:40 this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Jose Padilla, Zepeda's brother, was one of the top finishers in the 
17-and-under division. The Monroe High senior placed fifth at last year's City 
Section cross-country meet. 
</P>
<P>
 "This program has changed my life and it has really changed me," said Padilla, 
who lives in Panorama City with his parents and five siblings.  
</P>
<P>
 "It got me out of trouble. . . . It's helped me with school and it's even 
taught me to communicate better with others." 
</P>
<P>
 Padilla on Sunday will compete in the Jimmy Stewart Relay Marathon at Griffith 
Park. About 40 Jeopardy members, most of whom finished last month's L.A. 
Marathon, will participate in the event. 
</P>
<P>
 Each runner covers 5.2 miles before handing the baton to a fellow team member. 
Last year Jeopardy won the junior high girls' division and the high school 
girls placed third. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Their exploits come despite having poor equipment. Often they run in cutoff 
jeans and without proper shoes because most can't afford the gear. 
</P>
<P>
 It's frustrating, Malan says, to scrounge for every penny for a program that 
has made such a difference. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not sponsored by the city," she said. "We raise our own money. Our 
biggest expense is food and transportation." 
</P>
<P>
 For this year's L.A. Marathon, an organization loaned shorts and shirts to 
Jeopardy, but insisted they be returned. 
</P>
<P>
 Malan cajoled a local councilman's office to donate the bus that transported 
runners to a Ventura beach for a workout last week.  
</P>
<P>
 About 50 kids participated in the 15-mile beach run and barbecue. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's good to get them out of the city," Malan said. "To keep them coming to 
practice we have to take these field trips. It's like a reward." 
</P>
<P>
 Malan hurt her back earlier in the week and didn't run, but she yelled words 
of encouragement in Spanish and English as the kids jogged by. She also took 
photos with a small camera that hung around her neck. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're like my kids," she said. "I spend more time with them than they spend 
with their own parents. They even call me at home. It's funny, they call me 
Mama Rosa." 
</P>
<P>
 The program has about 57 members ages 8 to 18. They run daily, participate in 
weekend races and go on training journeys to the beach and mountains during 
school breaks. 
</P>
<P>
 The dedication is startling, Malan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Members wake to work out when it's still dark outside. Every weekday at 4 
a.m., Malan begins her rounds in a van, picking up youths throughout the Valley 
for their morning run. 
</P>
<P>
 The training sessions often begin in front of a Northridge government housing 
project on Parthenia St. and Wilbur Ave., where about half the kids in the 
program live. 
</P>
<P>
 The group runs from five to 10 kilometers, depending on upcoming races. 
</P>
<P>
 "At first the kids were getting shot at by dope dealers as they crossed the 
street to come to practice, so I had to start picking them up," Malan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jesus Zepeda, who has three sons in Jeopardy, is thankful his kids have a way 
to spend energy in a positive manner. Otherwise, the family could not afford 
extracurricular activities. 
</P>
<P>
 "The discipline has even helped them in school," Jesus said in Spanish. 
"There's more communication and an overall better relationship between family 
members now." 
</P>
<P>
 Jesus is a bartender who works from 5 p.m. to 2 a.m. He attends many of his 
sons' races, but most parents are not as involved. 
</P>
<P>
 That's why in addition to her work obligations, Malan dedicates an additional 
20 hours weekly of her personal time to Jeopardy. She even convinced her three 
children, ages 14, 13 and 7, to run with the program. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Malan grew up in Los Angeles in a family of seven siblings. She started 
running at 12, but three years later when she expressed interest in doing it 
competitively, her mother objected. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm first generation Mexican-American and girls just didn't do that," Malan 
said. "My mother thought, 'It's not good to run.' 
</P>
<P>
 "Still, it changed my life. It taught me self-discipline and motivation and 
how to strive for things. It was also a good way to get rid of stress and 
frustration." 
</P>
<P>
 So when Malan was taken off street patrol duty and assigned to run Jeopardy in 
1992, she implemented a running program. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had been in Jeopardy for about seven months and I took eight of the kids on 
a camping trip with my family," Malan said.  
</P>
<P>
 "I took them hiking about five miles to go fishing at the lake but I was on a 
horse. Going back it was too steep for the horse, so I got off and started 
running. 
</P>
<P>
 "It really got the kids going because they were like 'I don't want to get beat 
by that old lady.' Then I knew I had to get these kids running." 
</P>
<P>
 As long as it keeps youths out of trouble, Malan will wake up at dawn to run 
with them. After working the streets with the LAPD's gang unit, she has seen 
firsthand what can happen to children with no direction. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's sad," Malan said. "In most cases the parents are totally oblivious. So 
when you see this work, it's very rewarding."

ROLE REVERSAL FOR WOODARD AND DRUCKER; BASKETBALL: TAFT BOYS' COACH OF 13 
YEARS, FED UP WITH SYSTEM HE SAYS ENCOURAGES CHEATING, TAKES OVER GIRLS' TEAM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 After 13 years, Jim Woodard has had enough of coaching the boys' basketball 
team at Taft High. 
</P>
<P>
 So, he's going to coach the Taft girls' team. 
</P>
<P>
 Woodard, who has guided the Toreadors to two league championships and three 
City Section quarterfinal appearances, stepped down Thursday while accepting 
the job as varsity girls' coach. 
</P>
<P>
 In turn, Mark Drucker, the school's girls' coach for the past four years, will 
replace Woodard as boys' coach. 
</P>
<P>
 "Definitely his idea," Drucker, a former assistant to Woodard, said of the 
switch. "I knew he would eventually step down, but I was a little surprised 
when he did." 
</P>
<P>
 Woodard, The Times' All-Valley coach of the year in 1991, said he "needed a 
change" and had been considering leaving the boys' program for the past year. 
More specifically, the coach said he had grown discouraged over the years with 
increasing reports of players and coaches allegedly circumventing City Section 
rules regarding residency and illegal recruiting. 
</P>
<P>
 Woodard declined to be specific. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sure everybody knows all the stories," Woodard said. "I'm tired of 
listening to myself moan and groan about a system I can't do anything about. I 
don't believe in teaching kids to lie about their address and (find) various 
ways around the system." 
</P>
<P>
 Woodard, who compiled a 181-102 record at Taft, said he considered that sort 
of thing to be less prevalent in girls' basketball. 
</P>
<P>
 "I still like coaching," Woodard said. "It's another opportunity and I'm 
looking forward to it. And I'm very happy with Mark taking over the boys' 
program. He's an excellent coach and we've been friends for 25 years." 
</P>
<P>
 Drucker, 40, a 1972 Taft graduate, served as a varsity assistant for nine 
years before becoming girls' coach in 1990. He led the Toreadors to league 
championships in 1991, '93 and '94. 
</P>
<P>
 Last season, Taft reached the 3-A semifinals, losing to Banning, the eventual 
champion. 
</P>
<P>
 Drucker said he has long envisioned becoming boys' coach after Woodard stepped 
down. 
</P>
<P>
 "It definitely will be a challenge, stepping from girls to boys," Drucker 
said. "But I think I've been around long enough. I definitely know the game and 
I relate well to the players. And the players definitely know me."

PITCHING COULD BE TICKET TO OMAHA; BASEBALL: THE TITANS' COLLEGE WORLD SERIES 
HOPES ARE ON THE RISE BECAUSE OF TEAM'S DEEP, SOLID STAFF. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Ed Parisi of Arcadia hasn't missed a Cal State Fullerton baseball game since 
his son, Mike, started pitching for the Titans in 1992. Parisi is a partner in 
a freight company, which gives him a bit of leverage when it comes to choosing 
his days off. And, now, he is starting to think optimistically about some 
travel plans for late May and early June. 
</P>
<P>
 Ed Parisi is not about to jinx anything by buying non-refundable airline 
tickets for games that he knows might not take place, but Parisi's son would 
like nothing better than to give his father a special gift: trips to the NCAA 
regional tournament and the College World Series. 
</P>
<P>
 Ah, even if ol' Dad gladly will be paying the bills for his trip. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's the one who got me into sports," Mike Parisi said. "I feel I owe a lot 
of my success to him. He's supported and encouraged me every step of the way. 
He's been an important part of my life." 
</P>
<P>
 If the Titans make it to the playoffs this year, certainly Parisi and his 
pitching pals can be expected to be key figures, particularly if the season 
continues the way it has been going. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton's pitching has been superb, with only rare exceptions, and it has 
been a major factor in the 26-6 record and No. 1 national ranking by Collegiate 
Baseball going into this weekend's three-game series against Long Beach State. 
</P>
<P>
 Parisi and sophomore newcomer Matt Wagner, two right-handers, virtually have 
been unbeatable. Wagner is 7-0 and has won a starting role after a strong 
showing in relief early in the season. Parisi, a junior, is 7-1 after a 
two-hitter in the team's 11-0 victory over UC Santa Barbara last weekend. It 
was his third shutout of the season, tying a school record. 
</P>
<P>
 Both have eye-popping stats. Parisi's 1.44 earned-run average is the best in 
the conference and 18th in the nation, and Wagner's 1.46 is second and 19th. 
The team ERA of 2.62 also is the best in the league, and sixth nationally. 
Miami's 2.26 is first. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior Chad Rolish, the third starter, has struggled a bit lately, but still 
has a 5-3 record and 2.43 ERA. Sophomore Ted Silva (3-1) has proved to be a 
capable stopper coming out of the bullpen for the second season in a row; he 
has eight saves in 17 appearances. 
</P>
<P>
 The lone pitcher who performed below expectations in the first half of the 
season was Dan Ricabal, the team's most consistent pitcher a year ago when he 
was 11-3. His record is 3-0 this season, but his ERA is 4.98, and he has walked 
23 in 35 innings. 
</P>
<P>
 "We felt we were an underachieving pitching staff last season, but with the 
guys a year older we're doing better in general," said George Horton, the 
associate head coach who handles the pitchers for Coach Augie Garrido. 
</P>
<P>
 Horton feels that's especially true in Parisi's case. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mike has taken a big step forward this season," Horton said. "He's become a 
pitcher instead of a thrower. . . . I like to call him a big-pitch pitcher now. 
He makes the big pitch when he needs it." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 This season is taking on special importance for Parisi. It could be his last 
with the Titans, especially if he and the team remain successful. Parisi is 
thinking seriously of passing up his final year of college eligibility to sign 
a pro contact. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the team gets to the College World Series, and I have a good year, then 
I'll probably be ready to go," Parisi said. 
</P>
<P>
 Parisi, 6 feet 3 and 195 pounds, feels he still needs to be stronger. 
</P>
<P>
 "I need to pick up 10 more pounds of solid muscle," Parisi said. "I've done 
off-season weight work in the past, and that's always helped. I have to limit 
the weight work I do during the season, but I'll work at it very seriously 
again once the season ends." 
</P>
<P>
 But Parisi is mostly putting those pro baseball thoughts aside for now. 
Winning the conference championship remains his goal at this stage. 
</P>
<P>
 "We haven't done that since I've been here, and we're going to work hard as a 
team to do that," he said. "The last two years we've gone into the league 
season just doing OK, but we're way ahead of that this time. We're definitely a 
lot deeper than we've been the last two years. Our pitching staff is so deep, 
with so many quality arms, that everyone feels confident going out there." 
</P>
<P>
 Parisi, however, is beginning to feel the burden of high expectations. "It's 
there at times," he said. "Even my friends will say some things sometimes that 
leave me with those kinds of impressions. At the beginning of the season, most 
of the publicity was going to Dante (Powell, a preseason All-American 
outfielder), but now it seems more of the attention is being focused on me 
after I got off to a good start. That can be nice, but pressure comes with 
that, too." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Wagner has helped to take some of that pressure off Parisi. He has been a huge 
surprise, even to himself. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was the ninth pitcher out of 11 on the depth chart when I started the year, 
and now I'm starting," he said with a smile. 
</P>
<P>
 Wagner came to Fullerton as a walk-on after spending his freshman year at 
Division II Abilene Christian. 
</P>
<P>
 "I liked the coach, but not the school, and the team wasn't very good, so I 
decided to go somewhere else," he said. "I wanted to come to California, and so 
I wound up here." 
</P>
<P>
 Wagner, 6-5 and 215, was 5-1 at Abilene Christian, but he feels the record was 
deceiving. "I really didn't get to pitch that much, and when I did, I didn't 
pitch that well," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Horton said Wagner almost didn't make the season's first trip. 
</P>
<P>
 "Actually, it was between him and another guy for that first road trip to 
Stanford," Horton recalled. "I'm glad we took him, though, because he pitched 
well twice that weekend and has done a great job for us ever since. Parisi is 
having a great year, but Matt is probably the big difference for us." 
</P>
<P>
 Horton also believes Ricabal could be an important factor the rest of the way. 
</P>
<P>
 "Danny is pitching much better now," Horton said. "He's battled through this, 
and we feel he's getting to the level of last year, which will really help." 
</P>
<P>
 Rolish is optimistic that he can have a strong finish to his college career, 
too. 
</P>
<P>
 "Actually, I haven't pitched poorly in any of those last three games, but my 
record is 0-2 in them," he said. "I'd still like to win 10 games this season 
and I feel I can do that. But I just want to be able to keep us in any game I'm 
pitching, and I'm confident I can do that." 
</P>
<P>
 Rolish, a left-hander, hopes the team's success will work in favor of his pro 
aspirations as well. Unlike Parisi and Wagner, Rolish doesn't have the classic 
pitching physique (5-10 and 180). He knows he'll need to pitch exceptionally 
well the rest of the season to be noticed. Ample opportunity for that exists 
for Rolish as well as the others as Fullerton heads into the final, most 
important leg of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pitching has definitely been our most consistent thing," Horton said. "It 
gives you a chance to win every time out, regardless of everything else. You 
don't win championships without it." 
</P>
<P>
 Or even think about tentative plans for trips to Omaha, as Ed Parisi can tell 
you.

ROME, EVERETT DEFEND THEIR POSITIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE REILLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jim Rome didn't apologize Thursday, and neither did Jim Everett. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Rome, the TV and radio talk-show host, and Everett, the former Ram 
quarterback, defended their positions in their Wednesday night confrontation 
during a live interview on ESPN2's "Talk 2" program in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 Rome defended his questioning of Everett, who pushed aside a table and knocked 
the talk show host to the floor. 
</P>
<P>
 Everett, traded to the New Orleans Saints last month, objected when Rome 
repeatedly called him by the name of female tennis star "Chris Evert," a 
derisive reference to Everett's perceived reluctance to be hit on the football 
field. 
</P>
<P>
 "I stand by what I did," Rome said on XTRA radio. "But I regret it happening. 
</P>
<P>
 "I regret hitting him with (the Chris reference) a third time. But he got in 
my face and challenged me." 
</P>
<P>
 No punches were thrown. Rome wasn't injured, but he complained that coffee was 
spilled on his jacket during the fracas. He said he doesn't plan to press 
charges and that he tried Thursday to invite Everett back on the air, but 
couldn't reach him. 
</P>
<P>
 Everett, speaking to the New Orleans media Thursday from his Las Vegas home, 
wouldn't say if he would accept the invitation, nor did he regret what he did. 
</P>
<P>
 "Number one, I don't condone the physical abuse-type thing," Everett said. "I 
really don't condone my actions, but I was put in a position that I was going 
to be in a journalistic-type interview and, instead, I was put into what I felt 
was taunting. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't regret what I did. I mean, I have to live with the actions and I'm 
prepared to face whatever repercussions there are." 
</P>
<P>
 Rome said Everett did not apologize Wednesday, but accused him of "looking for 
ratings." Rome denied that the confrontation was a publicity ploy, adding that 
producer Mark Shapiro had twice warned Everett he would be called "Chris." He 
said Everett did not object. MIKE REILLEY

<P>
 Top Rank Boxing has purchased the Ten Goose operation in Van Nuys, including 
the contracts of Rafael Ruelas, the International Boxing Federation lightweight 
champion, and his brother Gabriel, promoter Bob Arum said Thursday in Beverly 
Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Dan Goossen, former head of Ten Goose, was named executive vice president of 
Top Rank Boxing and will manage the Olympic Auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
 "This move is something I could only have done with Arum," Goossen said. 
"We've been on opposite sides of the fence when it comes to negotiating, but 
we've always been friends." 
</P>
<P>
 For 13 years, Goossen was president and promoter of Ten Goose, putting on 
shows with his family at the Country Club in Reseda. Those shows will no longer 
be held. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm bringing Danny aboard because he is an experienced boxing man who knows 
this area well," Arum said. SEAN WATERS

OHIO STATE CONSIDERING AN OFFER TO PLAY IN PIGSKIN CLASSIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After failing to lure Nebraska, organizers of the Disneyland Pigskin Classic 
have targeted Ohio State for the Aug. 29 college football game at Anaheim 
Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 The Big Ten co-champion has been offered a spot to play Fresno State, but 
whether the Buckeyes accept is up to Coach John Cooper and the team, Athletic 
Director Jim Jones said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Don Andersen, executive director of the Orange County Sports Assn., which 
stages the game, is optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a done deal, but it's a definite possibility," Andersen said. "We've 
never had a Big Ten team . . . this would be a real plum for us." 
</P>
<P>
 Previously, Andersen believed he had an agreement with Nebraska Athletic 
Director Bill Byrne to have the Cornhuskers participate. But lack of team 
approval torpedoed the invitation. 
</P>
<P>
 Andersen said a commitment from Ohio State "would put that all behind us." He 
expects a decision within a few days. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ohio State has a great football tradition," Andersen said, "and the fact that 
they represent a market with a huge number of television homes is also a real 
plus." JASON H. REID

SAFETY HOPES IN INGLEWOOD REST ON CURFEW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICH CONNELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A chill hangs in the midnight air -- a chill of the mind as much as the 
mercury -- as teen-agers begin pouring from the hall after Inglewood High 
School's spring break dance. 
</P>
<P>
 Quietly but conspicuously, half a dozen armed school police officers fan out, 
keeping watch, as the students laugh, chat and huddle in knots along Manchester 
Boulevard, a busy thoroughfare that leads to South-Central Los Angeles one way 
and the coastal enclaves of Westchester and Playa del Rey the other. 
</P>
<P>
 With one of the highest crime rates in Los Angeles County and still aching 
from the killing of a toddler, a cheerleader and nine others gunned down in a 
record weekend of bloodshed earlier this year, Inglewood experiences no small 
uneasiness when young people are out at night and vulnerable. 
</P>
<P>
 "The gangs, the shootings. They keep you on pins and needles," said parent 
Tongia Johnson, who arrived before the dance ended and parked just outside the 
hall door to collect her 15-year-old daughter. "You're scared about (your 
children) all the time." 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't know who's gonna walk up behind you and just start shooting," 
15-year-old Patrice Taylor said as she waited for a ride with a group of 
friends. 
</P>
<P>
 Not surprisingly, many parents such as Johnson -- and even a fair share of 
teen-agers -- have welcomed Inglewood's aggressive revival of a simple, 
seldom-used law enforcement tool: the juvenile curfew law. 
</P>
<P>
 A growing number of cities -- Norwalk, Long Beach and Santa Monica -- have 
turned to juvenile curfews in recent years to help stem street crime. But 
Inglewood's new, highly organized system of weekend sweeps, which is drawing 
critical attention from the American Civil Liberties Union, is among the 
toughest and most ambitious of the new wave of enforcement efforts. The curfew 
has been in effect since March 18. 
</P>
<P>
 And it appears to have extended a special sense of hope to a community where 
the police chief, who was shot at by a would-be robber one night last year, has 
urged residents to remain home after dark. 
</P>
<P>
 "At least they're thinking about (us)," said Patrice King, an Inglewood High 
senior. "I'm thankful that people do care." 
</P>
<P>
 The Friday and Saturday night sweeps begin at 11 and target anyone under 18 
who is on the streets without a legitimate reason, such as returning from work 
or a dance or running an errand with a parent's permission. The curfew is 10 on 
weeknights, although the special enforcement program is concentrated on the 
weekends, when the most shootings occur. 
</P>
<P>
 Roving vans and a cadre of reserve police officers, backed by community 
volunteers who handle paperwork at the station, rounded up more than four dozen 
youths in the first three weekends, among them an 11-year-old boy, several 
young girls and a 17-year-old robbery suspect. 
</P>
<P>
 In one particularly disturbing apprehension, officers who approached a 
beer-drinking 17-year-old found an AK-47 assault rifle. In the teen-ager's 
pocket was a fully loaded 30-round ammunition magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 The mix of youths picked up so far underscores part of the rationale for 
resuscitating a neglected program that some may view as faintly anachronistic 
on today's streets. As much as nabbing potentially violent teen-agers, 
officials say they are trying to remove young targets from the gangbangers' 
cross-fire. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want young people off the streets," Police Chief Oliver Thompson said. "If 
I have them off the street, they are not likely to be victims of crime or 
perpetrators of the crime." 
</P>
<P>
 One aim of the program is to prod parents into accepting more responsibility 
for their children. Parents must collect their children at the police station, 
and later accompany the young violator to juvenile court, where penalties can 
range from community service work to fines of up to $675. 
</P>
<P>
 No one is touting the curfew crackdown as a panacea for crime problems in this 
predominantly minority bedroom community of 113,000, which last year averaged a 
homicide every eight days; nearly half of them were attributed to gang 
violence. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is only one step," said Councilman Jose Fernandez, a 34-year-old high 
school teacher who grew up in the city and pushed the curfew program. "It's 
creating a climate of order . . . setting guidelines and rules. There is a 
(public) pessimism that needs to be changed. People feel there is no hope; 
there will be no change." 
</P>
<P>
 Inglewood officials are pleased with the anecdotal results of the program, but 
there is scant research on what long-term changes occur when juvenile curfew 
programs are strictly enforced, criminologists say. Some law enforcement 
officials view them as political reactions with dubious value, and some street 
officers complain that curfew programs can bog them down in baby-sitting of 
wayward youths. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I first made the announcement (at an officer roll call), everybody 
rolled their eyes," Inglewood Lt. Alex Perez said. But by most accounts, 
including those of police association representatives, officers for now are 
supporting the effort. 
</P>
<P>
 Some curfew programs have succumbed to cost considerations and higher-priority 
law enforcement tasks. Inglewood officials insist that they are committed to 
sustaining strong curfew enforcement, although just how that will be 
accomplished remains vague. Officials have been relying heavily on unpaid 
reserve officers and community volunteers to carry the program, and it is 
uncertain how long they can do that. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if city officials can figure out ways to maintain the program, it could 
face a legal challenge. A spokeswoman for the ACLU of Southern California says 
attorneys are reviewing Inglewood's enforcement of the juvenile curfew for 
possible constitutional violations. 
</P>
<P>
 On the streets, there is no shortage of critics among Inglewood teen-agers and 
young adults, from student leaders to gang members. 
</P>
<P>
 At Rogers Park near the heart of the city -- the territory of the Neighborhood 
Pirus or NHP gang -- some scoffed at the curfew.  
</P>
<P>
 "You're still gonna see 16- and 17-year-olds running out here. The majority of 
the people doing all (the shootings) are 16 and 17," said "Kilo," who pointedly 
showed a huge abdominal scar that he said he received in a shooting near the 
park last year. If the curfew is rigidly enforced, he warned, it would 
exacerbate volatile relationships many teen-agers have with their parents. "I 
think it could cause more violence at home," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Scooby," wearing an "NHP" cap, conceded that it may be a good idea to get 
young people off the streets at night, but he noted that many gang members will 
not be affected. "I'm over 18. They can't do nothing to me," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 At Inglewood High, UC Irvine-bound Erin Bryant, 17, secretary-treasurer of her 
class, was skeptical for different reasons. "It's a temporary solution to a 
permanent problem. It was proposed to reduce the level of youth violence . . . 
however, things can occur whether its night or day." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, of the 11 shootings on that gruesome January weekend, the five 
fatalities occurred between 7 and 8:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 But at least as many young people voice support for the curfew program, or at 
least grudgingly acknowledged that it is having the desired effect. "In a way, 
it helps," said a 17-year-old from the Hyde Park area, who dryly described 
being nabbed in the sweeps while hanging out in front of a friend's house 
around midnight. Now, his mother makes him come home by 9 on most nights. 
</P>
<P>
 For some teen-agers, the curfew actually seems to have enhanced their freedom 
to go out and socialize, interviews show. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's one reason I let her come tonight," said Bernard Webster, a 
maintenance worker who was waiting to collect his 14-year-old daughter at the 
high school dance. "I (was) reluctant. . . . (But) I feel safer. I think it 
will cut out a lot of drive-by shootings." 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, the curfew comes as Inglewood's crime rate -- including 
gang-related incidents -- has declined from peaks of a few years ago. But 
officials say homicides remain unacceptably high -- well above levels of a 
decade or so ago -- and the horrifying violence of some recent incidents has 
left many residents terrified. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the curfew program grew from community complaints and is part of the 
city's push into community-oriented, problem-solving policing, officials say. 
"It's one of the things people first talked to me about: 'Why aren't all these 
kids off the street?' " said Thompson, who came to the city two years ago from 
the Riverside Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Previous initiatives have included expanded Neighborhood Watch programs, 
basing police officers at public schools and offering a police-supervised 
program of midnight basketball games, designed in part to get older gang 
members and young adults off the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other things, officials hope the curfew will signal a new seriousness 
about crime control in a city that attracts tens of thousands of visitors each 
year to the Forum and Hollywood Park, which soon will open a large card club 
casino. 
</P>
<P>
 Inglewood, more than most cities in the county, has felt the strain of the 
region's growth and ethnic change. It went through wrenching years of conflict 
and massive white flight in the 1960s and early 1970s, partly the result of one 
of the state's first court-ordered, cross-town school busing programs. In the 
same period, charming neighborhoods suffered from increased jet noise as nearby 
Los Angeles International Airport grew. And the once-strong central business 
district, which drew from a large southern area of the county, declined as 
malls proliferated in nearby cities. 
</P>
<P>
 In that context, some see the experiment with the tough new curfew program as 
a sort of benchmark -- symbolizing a new determination by residents and 
businesses to reclaim their city. 
</P>
<P>
 At a block club meeting on 8th Place last week, residents praised the curfew 
program and complained sternly that troublemakers' parents must be held 
accountable. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to save these kids," Police Department spokesman Ruben Taylor 
told residents gathered in Gussie Collins' living room. "We're losing too many 
young black and brown men. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an attempt. A beginning. A start to try to gain control of our 
community," he said as residents nodded. "These are our children. This is our 
community." Timely Measures 
</P>
<P>
 A growing number of cities are reviving enforcement of juvenile curfew laws to 
combat street crime and reduce the number of young victims of random violence. 
Generally, the programs make exceptions for juveniles traveling for work, bona 
fide events or on approved errands for parents. Here are some of the recent 
experiments: 
</P>
<P>
 * Norwalk: Four-year-old program includes two specially supervised mobile 
mini-stations which can be deployed to juvenile trouble spots. Patrol officers 
drop off juveniles found on streets after 10 p.m. Parents are contacted, 
citations issued and community service ordered as penalty. Averaging about 20 
violators per week. Officials say it has reduced gang activity and drive-by 
shootings. 
</P>
<P>
 * Phoenix: Two-year-old program runs seven days a week and is a model for some 
other cities. Curfew is 10 p.m. for youths 15 and under, midnight for 16- and 
17-year-olds. Violators are cited and taken to centers staffed by police and 
recreation workers, where they can watch TV or play sports until parents 
arrive. Violent crime involving older teen-agers was down last year, but such 
crime was up slightly among younger ones. Legal challenge by American Civil 
Liberties Union now in state appeals court. 
</P>
<P>
 * Long Beach: Three-month-old program similar to that in Phoenix. Curfew is 10 
p.m. and enforced by regular patrol officers. Violators are cited and may be 
released or taken to recreation centers or police stations, where they are 
supervised by officers until parents arrive. About 20 juveniles a week receive 
citations. 
</P>
<P>
 * Santa Monica: Ordinance adopted last year sets curfew at 10 p.m. weekdays 
and 11 p.m. Friday and Saturday. Typically, police issue a warning, but 
occasionally issue citations or contact parents. About 15 curfew "contacts" a 
month are made with juveniles.

GUARDS HUNT, KILL PREMIER IN RWANDA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STANLEY MEISLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Marauding presidential guards terrorized tiny, crowded, hapless Rwanda and 
killed its prime minister and almost a dozen Belgian peacekeepers Thursday in a 
chaotic, murderous frenzy of revenge for the deaths of two Central African 
presidents. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly before she was hunted down, Rwandan Prime Minister Agathe 
Uwilingiyimana told Radio France International: "There is shooting. People are 
being terrorized. People are inside their homes lying on the floor. We are 
suffering the consequences of the death of the head of state." 
</P>
<P>
 According to confusing, conflicting reports trickling in here and into U.N. 
headquarters, Kigali, the Rwandan capital, seemed caught in two ethnic battles: 
</P>
<P>
 * An onslaught by extreme nationalists among the Hutu people taking out their 
revenge on moderate Hutus for trying to reach a peace agreement with rebels of 
the minority Tutsi people. 
</P>
<P>
 * A confrontation between the presidential guard and Tutsi rebels who had 
broken out of their U.N.-protected camp to take on the Hutu avengers. 
</P>
<P>
 The turmoil endangered a U.N.-brokered peace process in Rwanda and raised 
fears of reigniting conflict in the interrelated, adjoining country of Burundi 
-- the site of terrible tribal slaughter, some of it akin to genocide, in the 
last two decades. 
</P>
<P>
 Although numerous reports described the deaths of Rwandan President Juvenal 
Habyarimana and Burundian President Cyprian Ntayamira as assassinations, this 
could not be confirmed by official U.S. or U.N. sources. 
</P>
<P>
 The two leaders, both Hutus, were killed when their plane burst into flames 
while landing at the Kigali airport Wednesday night. Two Burundian ministers, 
five Rwandan senior officials and a French air crew died with them. 
</P>
<P>
 A Rwandan government official was quoted as insisting that two rockets had 
downed the plane. The Rwandan Ministry of Defense issued a statement describing 
the plane as "shot down by unidentified elements in circumstances which are 
still not clear." 
</P>
<P>
 But in Washington, State Department spokesman Mike McCurry said, "We don't 
know the cause of the crash. . . . Those reports have not been confirmed at 
this point." 
</P>
<P>
 The United Nations has a force of 2,500 peacekeeping troops in Rwanda, and 
Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali offered its help in investigating the 
crash and restoring order. But the United Nations said Rwandan authorities had 
refused to allow the peacekeepers to examine the wreckage. 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said members of the presidential guard broke into 
the presidential palace to seize the prime minister, but she slipped away while 
her hunters disarmed a U.N. guard. Members of the presidential guard are widely 
regarded as extreme Hutu nationalists. Most Rwandans regarded the prime 
minister as a moderate Hutu. 
</P>
<P>
 The prime minister, according to Eckhard, tried to take refuge in the compound 
that houses U.N. Development Program workers and U.N. Volunteers, a group of 
young people much like the Peace Corps. But the presidential guard broke into 
the civilian U.N. compound and seized her before she could flee again. 
</P>
<P>
 Eckhard said that some sources reported that she was shot on the spot while 
others reported her killed outside the compound. 
</P>
<P>
 The United Nations said the presidential guard had also rounded up several 
ministers and their families. Their fate was not known, but President Clinton, 
in a statement condemning the killing of the prime minister, said, "I am 
equally horrified that elements of the Rwandan security forces have sought out 
and murdered Rwandan officials." 
</P>
<P>
 The husband and children of Prime Minister Uwilingiyimana, however, were in 
U.N. protective custody, Eckhard said. 
</P>
<P>
 Amid the violence, there were reports monitored in Nairobi, Kenya, that three 
Cabinet ministers were abducted and 17 Jesuit Rwandan priests were killed. 
</P>
<P>
 Amnesty International, the London-based human rights organization, reported 
that two Rwandan human rights activists -- Monique Mujawamaliya and Charles 
Shamukiga -- had been abducted. 
</P>
<P>
 The Washington office of another international organization, Human Rights 
Watch, said Mujawamaliya was on the phone with its staff members when she 
reported that government troops were scouring her neighborhood. "Please take 
care of my children. I don't want you to hear this," she said before she hung 
up. Human Rights Watch said it fears she is dead. 
</P>
<P>
 During the turmoil, 500 members of the mostly Tutsi Rwandan Patriotic Front 
broke out of their U.N. camp in Kigali to battle the presidential guard. The 
battles were described as violent, although the number of casualties was not 
known. The RPF was in the camp as part of a peace agreement worked out between 
the Hutu government and Tutsi rebels in Arusha, Tanzania, last August. 
</P>
<P>
 In New York, U.N. spokesman Joe Sills reported that 10 Belgian peacekeepers 
had been killed during the fighting and an 11th body had not yet been 
identified. 
</P>
<P>
 Rwanda and Burundi -- part of the German Empire before World War I, then ruled 
by Belgium until independence in 1962 -- have emerged only recently from a 
feudal system in which the tall Tutsis, only 10% of the population in Rwanda 
and 15% in Burundi, ruled as lords over the far more numerous Hutus. For 
centuries, Hutus farmed the land in exchange for protection from Tutsi masters. 
</P>
<P>
 In Rwanda, a country of 8 million, Hutus have dominated the political system 
since independence. But Tutsis, accusing President Habyarimana of repression 
since he took over the government in a coup more than 20 years ago, organized 
the RPF and provoked turmoil throughout the country in the last few years. 
</P>
<P>
 In Burundi, a country of 6 million, the history of the Tutsi-Hutu conflict has 
been far more bitter. Tutsis ruled from independence until last June. In one of 
the most depressing eras of African history, Tutsis put down a Hutu rebellion 
in 1972 and 1973 by trying to slaughter every Hutu with more than a primary 
school education. Perhaps 150,000 Hutus died in this terror. 
</P>
<P>
 An election in June installed Melchior Ndadaye as the first Hutu to serve as 
Burundi's president. But the Tutsi-dominated army assassinated him last 
December, setting off murderous waves of Tutsis and Hutus against each other. 
The death toll has reached 50,000.

RIORDAN DIGGING DEEP TO CRAFT NEW BUDGET PROPOSAL; SPENDING: MAYOR OMITS 
CONTROVERSIAL INITIATIVES. HE WILL CALL FOR SELLING SURPLUSES, CONSOLIDATING 
SOCIAL SERVICES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES RAINEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nine months after coming to office, Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan has 
delved into every nook of city government to come up with often novel austerity 
measures, in an attempt to balance a $3.8-billion budget, pay for more police 
officers and keep a lid on taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 His long-anticipated spending plan is as striking for what it omits as for 
what it includes. 
</P>
<P>
 Gone, for now, are Riordan's most ideologically and emotionally charged 
initiatives -- such as the lease or sale of Los Angeles International Airport, 
massive reductions in city pension contributions and the hiring of private 
companies to collect trash, City Hall sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 As alternatives, Riordan will propose less dramatic tactics to ferret out 
about $300 million in cuts and new revenues when he presents his budget to the 
City Council on April 20, according to city budget analysts, department heads, 
mayoral advisers and legislative aides interviewed by The Times. 
</P>
<P>
 He wants to sell up to 2 million barrels of surplus Department of Water and 
Power fuel oil. He plans to consolidate seven social service programs into a 
single new Community Services Department. In an accounting maneuver, he would 
have the financially flush Airport and Harbor departments subsidize more city 
services. And he is likely to push to expand the city's hiring of private 
"bounty hunters" to collect unpaid business taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 By cobbling together such innovations and reducing most city programs 
slightly, Riordan apparently will be able to plug a $200-million deficit and 
move ahead with his central pledge -- to beef up the Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Two dozen budget analysts are rushing to make the mayor's numbers balance. 
Half a dozen clerks have been working up to 14 hours a day, seven days a week 
to pump the information into computers. 
</P>
<P>
 The result will be a five-volume, 1,500-page tome that Riordan will present in 
a formal address to the City Council. The lawmakers will hold a series of 
hearings before passing judgment on the proposal to meet a June 1 City Charter 
deadline. 
</P>
<P>
 The Riordan Administration has declined to tip its hand publicly, but those 
familiar with the mayor's plan say it will have political legs because it does 
not ask the city's 3.5 million residents to pay higher taxes or put up with 
substantial reductions in basic services. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan is even expected to propose a tax cut to show his support for business 
people -- discontinuing a 7 1/2% business license surcharge that can cost firms 
thousands of dollars a year. The levy had been due to expire June 30 but was 
widely expected to be extended because of the city's flagging tax revenues. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is so much money buried in different places in this city," one Riordan 
adviser said. "No one has had the incentive to dig before. But by pushing on 
the department heads a little bit, there are results." 
</P>
<P>
 There are also potential pitfalls. The plan rests on two possibly shaky 
assumptions -- that the economy is about to rise out of a three-year recession 
and that the state government will continue its current level of financial 
support. If either premise collapses, more stringent actions may be required. 
</P>
<P>
 City Council members, meanwhile, will raise questions about the use of onetime 
money to keep the city functioning. They have said that they would prefer 
permanent sources of revenue to gambits such as the DWP oil and inventory 
sales. 
</P>
<P>
 Big business and city unions will also be represented in the opposition camp. 
</P>
<P>
 Airline and shipping executives, for example, have said that a plan to shift 
money to the city treasury and away from the airport and the Port of Los 
Angeles will endanger the profitability of two of the city's most successful 
concerns. Department of Water and Power workers will argue that any DWP savings 
should be returned to utility customers, not dumped into the city treasury. 
Other city workers may object to a proposed reduction in contributions to their 
pension system. 
</P>
<P>
 But Riordan's supporters said they believe those objections will pale in 
comparison to the public's appreciation that the mayor has found the $90 
million he needs to move forward with the first full year of his "Project 
Safety Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
 The police plan is designed to increase the LAPD from 7,600 officers to 10,455 
over five years and to put hundreds more police on the street immediately by 
increasing police overtime and moving uniformed officers out of desk jobs. The 
force would increase by 450 officers in the coming fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
 The Riordan adviser put the choices in the budget in simple terms: "You can 
have your pet projects or you can have more police." 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan's allies reject suggestions that many of his budget proposals are 
gimmicks that do not solve the city government's long-standing cash shortage. 
They cite, for example, a report from a panel of corporate leaders that said 
the city can save $118 million a year by operating the DWP more efficiently. 
</P>
<P>
 But the mayor's application of the corporate efficiency grinder to municipal 
affairs is expected to begin more modestly. To get a head start on the 
reorganization plans, the mayor has already: 
</P>
<P>
 * Asked for the resignations, effective July 1, of the five members of the 
board that oversees the Department of Public Works. Riordan believes that a 
single executive can better manage sewers, streets and trash collection. The 
expected $1.5-million saving is relatively paltry, but the action fulfills a 
campaign promise and is symbolically important as the one of the few 
contractions of the city's management in recent memory, a mayoral aide said. 
</P>
<P>
 * Presented council members with his proposal to consolidate seven social 
service programs into a new Community Services Department. Riordan aides 
believe many jobs can be cut and about $3 million a year could be saved by 
eliminating separate offices for the Community Development Department, the 
Department of Aging, the Social Service Department, the Commission on the 
Status of Women, the Human Relations Commission, the AIDS coordinator and the 
child-care coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
 * Embraced a plan, conceived by the City Council, to combine economic 
development programs now diffused among several departments. The new Economic 
Development Department would combine the Community Redevelopment Agency, the 
Housing Department and business functions of the Community Development 
Department and the mayor's office in an effort to make it easier for business 
people to find assistance at City Hall. Riordan's deputies have suggested that 
the entire operation might later be turned into a private, nonprofit 
corporation. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan's budget is expected to stop short of a more dramatic reconfiguration 
of city services -- one that would have put operations ranging from trash 
collection to data processing out to bid with private contractors. Although 
those ideas are expected to resurface, they have been hampered in the short run 
by adamant employee opposition. 
</P>
<P>
 One administration official concedes: "The simplistic answer of turning it all 
over to the private sector is not right. But there are areas where it would be 
right, and it's a matter of finding them and building a political consensus." 
</P>
<P>
 Without such private sector intervention, Riordan's first budget will bank 
heavily on three semi-independent departments that have remained financially 
robust during the recession -- the Department of Water and Power, the Airport 
Department and the Harbor Department. Taking money from those departments, or 
shifting charges there, frees funds in the anemic general fund, from which 
police salaries and most other city expenses are paid. 
</P>
<P>
 The burden will fall most heavily on the DWP, whose administrators have told 
the mayor's office that they can increase their anticipated contribution to the 
general fund this coming fiscal year by $75 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the increase would come through a massive sale of assets, beginning 
with the fuel oil. Stored at several electric plants to maintain power in 
emergencies, the 2.5 million barrels of oil are no longer needed because the 
utility's power plants have emergency supplies of cleaner natural gas. The sale 
of 2 million barrels could earn the city as much as $30 million, department 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, there is enough surplus pipe, cable, insulation and other 
materials in DWP warehouses to bring in up to $40 million more if sold to other 
utilities or contractors, said Ken Miyoshi, general manager of the city 
utility. Excess land sales might produce additional millions. 
</P>
<P>
 The oil and supply sales have never been tried and DWP officials said they are 
concerned that they might not be as lucrative as they hope. But they are 
relieved that Riordan has temporarily put on hold a proposal to reduce 
contributions to the DWP pension system. 
</P>
<P>
 "The next drop they get from us is blood. We can't give anymore," said 
Miyoshi, who added that he feels so strongly that he would quit if the mayor's 
office continues pushing the pension reduction plan. 
</P>
<P>
 The use of Airport Department and Harbor Department money will also be 
contested. Shipping and airline executives could go to court in an attempt to 
prevent a diversion to the city treasury -- citing state and federal laws that 
restrict the use of airport and harbor fees to improvements at the facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 But the mayor's office says the city has too narrowly defined the expenses 
that it incurs to support operations at the airport and the Port of Los 
Angeles. Riordan aides say, for example, that the airport treasury should pay 
to maintain the Police Department's substation at LAX. Maintenance of streets 
in the harbor, by the same reasoning, might be charged to the Harbor 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Using this tactic, Riordan may try to charge as much as $10 million to the 
airport and $40 million to the harbor, several sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the mayor's other anticipated initiatives take on less powerful 
opponents than the airlines and shippers, but they are not without controversy: 
</P>
<P>
 * The mayor would like to improve collections of business taxes and has 
expressed interest in expanding a pilot program to send private firms after tax 
scofflaws. A report by City Controller Rick Tuttle suggests that $60 million 
can be recovered by cross-checking state income tax records. The results of 
increased collection efforts, however, are untested. 
</P>
<P>
 * About $21 million will flow into the city treasury if, as expected, Riordan 
extends a 2-year-old increase in a fee paid by residents to maintain garbage 
trucks. The increase amounts to $36 a year for homeowners. The mayor will argue 
that the extension of the increase does not violate his pledge against new 
taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 * Nearly $20 million more can be had if the city reduces its annual 
contribution to a pension fund for half of its 44,000 employees. The reduction 
is supported by Riordan and is smaller than previously discussed for other city 
retirement funds. The move is possible without threatening retirement benefits 
because salaries on which pensions are based have been increasing less rapidly 
than previously calculated, said Oscar Peters, manager of the $4-billion City 
Employee Retirement System. The proposal has already won preliminary approval 
from an independent actuary and the board that administers the City Employee 
Retirement System. 
</P>
<P>
 * A hiring freeze that has been in place for all but the Police and Fire 
departments for three years has already reduced the city work force by 3,000, 
to 44,000. Riordan is expected to continue to reduce payroll through attrition, 
cutting up to 500 workers and saving as much as $19 million. Riordan has hinted 
that libraries and parks, which have already had to reduce hours, might be 
excluded from the staff reductions. 
</P>
<P>
 * Finally, Riordan is expected to tap two sources that the city has used for 
the last two years to balance the budget -- the Community Redevelopment Agency 
and a parking meter revenue fund. He would like to get at least $25 million 
from the CRA and $20 million from the parking meter fund. 
</P>
<P>
 But social service and housing agencies are expected to object to the CRA 
diversion, saying it will leave less money for programs for the needy. And the 
parking fund has its constituency, too -- the small-business people who agreed 
to have parking meters in their neighborhoods only because they were told the 
money would be used to build a parking lot one day.

 An armored column of hundreds of South African troops and artillery is massed 
ominously nearby. Fellow Zulus are slaughtered daily in his name. And his role 
in a critical summit today may decide whether this nation's first all-race 
elections produce peace -- or a blood bath. 
</P>
<P>
 But Chief Mangosuthu Gatsha Buthelezi, arguably the greatest single threat to 
comity and democracy in this troubled land, sat back Thursday with a wry smile 
on his face, a gracious laugh and time to invite two reporters for a long 
interview and leisurely lunch with his Cabinet. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am relaxed," he said. "Why should I not be?" 
</P>
<P>
 At 65, His Excellency Dr. Mangosuthu Gatsha Ashpenaz Nathan Buthelezi, Prince 
of Kwaphindangene, Chief Minister of KwaZulu, president of the Inkatha Freedom 
Party, and a host of other titles, is a bundle of contradictions. 
</P>
<P>
 Long considered one of the most critical leaders in the anti-apartheid 
struggle, Buthelezi, critics say, now is stirring a volatile mix of ethnic 
tensions and political hatreds to wreck elections in KwaZulu, the embattled 
Zulu homeland that he rules, and the surrounding province of Natal. 
</P>
<P>
 He insists that he eschews violence. But he sponsors guerrilla training camps 
and heads a 4,000-member police force that functions as a private army. Two 
reports by the Goldstone Commission, an independent judicial panel, have 
accused Buthelezi's KwaZulu police of supplying assault rifles and other 
weapons to Inkatha guerrillas and using death squads to support his rule. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Buthelezi says he has been "a democrat . . . all my life" with 
"legitimacy" as an elected leader, he heads a repressive one-party state and 
personal patronage machine where, according to the human rights group Africa 
Watch, "freedom of expression, assembly and association for other groups are 
routinely denied." 
</P>
<P>
 And most important, although Buthelezi says he is only seeking what he calls 
"a federal formula" for South Africa, similar to that in the United States, he 
has sworn to boycott the country's April 26-28 elections, insists that he will 
ignore the new interim constitution and will not recognize the dawning of 
democracy and the first government elected by the country's black majority. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether his bitter resistance will lead to brutal guerrilla war in the lush 
green hills of Natal is unclear. What is obvious is that Buthelezi and his 
followers are determined to destabilize the new nation by making the eastern 
province ungovernable unless his demands for virtual autonomy and a sovereign 
Zulu state are accommodated. 
</P>
<P>
 "What you're talking about is a growling, sad, bitter, endless rumble of 
violence and discontent," warned Bill Johnson of the independent Institute for 
Multi-Party Democracy in Durban. "If we go down that road, we're in for long, 
long trouble." 
</P>
<P>
 Hopes of finally crafting a political settlement are riding on today's 
long-awaited summit between Buthelezi, his pliant nephew, Zulu King Goodwill 
Zwelithini, and their two chief opponents in the crisis, President Frederik W. 
de Klerk and African National Congress leader Nelson Mandela. 
</P>
<P>
 In some ways, it will be Buthelezi's crowning moment, his place on center 
stage alongside the leaders with whom he has so often clashed -- and whose 
power he has so long wanted to usurp. So what does Buthelezi expect? 
</P>
<P>
 "Just one more meeting," he said evenly. "Not a big deal." 
</P>
<P>
 He is equally dismissive of the province-wide state of emergency announced by 
De Klerk last week to stem the bloodletting that claimed almost 300 victims 
last month alone. More than 2,000 South African troops have poured into Natal, 
and dozens of heavy armored vehicles, some with mounted cannons, were parked 
along the road only 18 miles from his office here Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "They will achieve nothing," Buthelezi said. "In fact, more people have died 
since they were deployed here." 
</P>
<P>
 Alternately charming and combative, engaging and explosive, Buthelezi insists 
he is just misunderstood. To hear him tell it, as he did for two hours 
Thursday, the press is "demonizing" him. Mandela has been "foul-mouthing" him 
and "entertaining people at my expense." De Klerk has "never been a man of his 
word." And his legions of enemies "scrape the bottom of the pot to vilify us." 
</P>
<P>
 Questions he doesn't like are "insulting." Ask if he agrees with the former 
friends here and around the globe who call him a "spoiler," trying to delay or 
wreck the elections because he can't win them, his charm turns to cold fury. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I called you a bastard and asked you if you liked to be called a bastard, 
what would you say to that?" he replied icily. "You're asking if a swearword is 
acceptable to me." 
</P>
<P>
 Even less acceptable is the fate planned for his fiefdom under the new 
constitution. KwaZulu and the other nine "homelands" created under apartheid as 
dumping grounds for unwanted blacks will be reincorporated into the new South 
Africa immediately after the elections. 
</P>
<P>
 At a speech in Durban on Wednesday, Mandela threatened to simply cut the 
monthly payment used to cover salaries for the Zulu king, Buthelezi, his 
Cabinet, the hundreds of tribal chiefs and warlords who are under his control, 
as well as the civil service. An estimated 75% of KwaZulu's budget comes 
directly or indirectly from Pretoria. 
</P>
<P>
 Buthelezi scorns the notion. Mandela, he said, would "be utterly mad" to cut 
off money used for schools, hospitals, clinics, welfare and pensioners. "The 
people as taxpayers . . . are entitled to that money," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Buthelezi's role as a sharp thorn in the side of his opponents is not new. In 
the 1970s, he refused to accept "independence" for KwaZulu, foiling the white 
supremacist regime in Pretoria in its effort to win legitimacy for its crude 
attempts to officially expel as many blacks as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 That, and his brave, persistent calls to release Mandela from prison, gave 
Buthelezi -- who never was imprisoned -- towering stature abroad. So did his 
staunch anti-communism, his support for free enterprise and his refusal to 
support the ANC campaigns of mass protest and armed struggle. 
</P>
<P>
 And it has made his fall from grace even more dramatic. 
</P>
<P>
 He was welcomed to the White House by Presidents Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan 
and George Bush. He considers former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, 
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres close 
friends. A shelf in his circular Cabinet room is crowded with dozens of other 
signed, smiling portraits of his meetings with everyone from former Los Angeles 
Mayor Tom Bradley to Pope John Paul II. 
</P>
<P>
 Buthelezi is bitter that President Clinton never responded when he wrote, 
congratulating him on his inauguration; Clinton has refused to invite him to 
Washington. The U.S. Congress also cut off funds to Buthelezi after allocating 
$4 million last year to assist Inkatha's expected election preparations. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Clinton government is anti-us," Buthelezi complained. "I mean anti-me and 
anti-Inkatha. . . . They have decided that Mr. Mandela and Mr. De Klerk will 
sort out the problems and they are concerned about them, and not about us." 
</P>
<P>
 It is a melancholy refrain, one he repeats over and over. "People pretend we 
don't exist," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But he is a sad figure these days. He lingers with reporters long after their 
questions are done. With few others singing his praises, he autographs and 
hands out hagiographies of his achievements; he sends an aide scurrying to 
fetch a London newspaper editorial that supports him. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of his closest supporters were baffled, then horrified, when he joined an 
anti-ANC negotiating alliance that included the most rabid fringes of 
right-wing whites, groups that have threatened to launch civil war rather than 
submit to black rule. 
</P>
<P>
 He is given to harangues and tirades, not to mention speeches so long-winded 
that he holds a spot in the 1994 The Guinness Book of Records for the longest 
address ever -- he spoke for 11 days at the opening of the KwaZulu Legislative 
Assembly last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts and diplomats who study Buthelezi call him a tragic figure, an 
embittered man whose overweening pride and ambition have blinded him to 
reality. Mary de Haas, a University of Natal sociologist who has written on 
Inkatha and the Zulus, has an even harsher assessment. 
</P>
<P>
 "I used to think he was a shrewd politician," she said. "I now think he's 
stark, stirring mad. He's a megalomaniac, and he's paranoid, as well." 
</P>
<P>
 The estimated 7 million Zulus are South Africa's largest ethnic group. 
Although Buthelezi invariably speaks of himself and King Zwelithini as their 
only true leaders, the Zulus in Natal are not a monolithic group. Polls show 
younger, urban and educated Zulus support Mandela's ANC, while older, rural and 
poorer Zulus back Buthelezi's Inkatha. And the ANC is clearly more popular. 
</P>
<P>
 "The political universe in Natal is split pretty much in half between the ANC 
and everyone else," Johnson said. "And that other half is split between Inkatha 
and everyone else." 
</P>
<P>
 But Buthelezi's appeals to Zulu ethnic passions and warrior traditions to 
shore up his dwindling power base have fanned emotions that may be difficult to 
extinguish. A Western diplomat who has known and studied him for years is 
grimly pessimistic. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would not be surprised if he dug in and fought to the end," the diplomat 
said. "You think we're having trouble now? Wait until after the election. This 
will look like a picnic. 
</P>
<P>
 "He wants Natal," the diplomat added. "He's got to have a position that he 
thinks is worthy of himself, not a position that is dictated or negotiated or 
crafted by anybody else. I'm convinced that no rational solution is going to 
work unless it gives him what he wants, which is control of Natal." 
</P>
<P>
 Barring that, the diplomat said, Buthelezi owns property in the United 
Kingdom, and has "socked money away" overseas. 
</P>
<P>
 Buthelezi declines to talk about his future plans. He is "not a prophet," he 
said. For that matter, he added, he is not a politician either. "I'm a chief," 
he said proudly, a member of the royal family of one of Africa's great warrior 
tribes. "I could never not be part of serving my people." 
</P>
<P>
 But he has painted himself into a corner that seems smaller and smaller by the 
day. He, of course, sees it another way. "I do things on principle," he 
explained. "I have always been principled in my politics. I don't care how 
lonely I am." What the Zulus Want 
</P>
<P>
 KwaZulu is one of the 10 homelands created during the apartheid era to deprive 
blacks of full citizenship. They are due to disappear after South Africa's 
first all-race elections April 26-28. Mangosuthu Buthelezi's Zulu-based Inkatha 
Freedom Party says the interim constitution, under which South Africa will be 
ruled for five years after the elections, does not meet their demands for a 
large degree of autonomy for the provinces, which will be redrawn. More Zulus 
say they will not take part in the elections and have been in a virtual civil 
war with ANC supporters in Natal province.

INSPECTIONS OF STEEL-FRAME OFFICES URGED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 As the toll of earthquake damage to steel-frame buildings mounts, the state 
has issued an unprecedented advisory urging owners of buildings that suffered 
cosmetic damage to conduct thorough inspections to check for cracks in 
supporting columns. 
</P>
<P>
 Steel-frame office buildings have long been considered invulnerable to 
collapse, but the California Seismic Safety Commission issued its advisory this 
week because engineers have uncovered widespread evidence that steel beams and 
welds cracked in the Jan. 17 Northridge quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles city officials said that cracking has been found in the steel 
frames of at least 50 buildings, constituting at least 10% of the low- to 
mid-rise structures built in the area since 1970. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the failures occurred in mid-rise buildings of less than 10 stories, 
but an 18-story twin tower in Warner Center and an unidentified 23-story 
high-rise elsewhere in the San Fernando Valley also had structural problems. 
</P>
<P>
 The failures already have prompted city officials to require more rigorous 
welding procedures in new steel-frame buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, city officials said they plan to announce within two weeks that 
owners of all steel-frame buildings near the quake's epicenter will be required 
to conduct inspections for hidden structural damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Holguin, assistant chief of the building bureau of the city's building 
and safety department, said officials are also considering whether to require 
citywide inspections of such buildings, which made up half of all buildings 
constructed last year in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the mounting damage tally has sparked concerns about the safety of 
the cloud-piercing towers in Downtown, Century City and elsewhere, even though 
engineers emphasize that no steel-frame buildings came close to collapsing 
during the temblor. 
</P>
<P>
 "The world is watching," said L. Tom Tobin, executive director of the 
California Seismic Commission. "There is no question that this has been a 
wake-up call for the engineering and construction community world wide." 
</P>
<P>
 Steel-frame buildings, designed to bend with the enormous forces of an 
earthquake without breaking, have been considered among the safest to ride out 
an earthquake. But the commission noted: "Damage was reported to a significant 
number of steel structures shaken by the Northridge earthquake, raising 
concerns about the extent and implications of this damage." 
</P>
<P>
 The advisory issued Wednesday said damage to some types of steel buildings has 
never before been observed. "This is a new concern that can be serious, but 
should not be exaggerated," the commission said. 
</P>
<P>
 Noting that "damage can weaken a building's ability to resist future 
earthquakes," the commission urged building owners who observed damage to 
contact architects or engineers to investigate.  
</P>
<P>
 City officials fear that because steel columns are covered by walls and thick 
fireproofing material, damage is not readily apparent to building owners or 
even to engineers, and that the number with cracked frames may escalate 
further. By late February, only a dozen buildings with steel-frame damage had 
been reported. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, about 90% of the steel-frame buildings where cracks have been reported 
to the city are in the Valley; most of the others are on the Westside. All are 
believed to have been built in the last decade. 
</P>
<P>
 Failures among these relatively new structures may have been the result of a 
different welding method used in recent years, said Los Angeles structural 
engineer Nabih Youssef, who is the head of a city blue-ribbon panel on seismic 
hazards. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten percent of the joints in the Warner Center's 18-story twin towers cracked; 
other buildings had breaks in up to 90% of the welds that hold vertical columns 
and horizontal beams, Holguin said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Building owners should take this seriously," he added. "There is a concern 
that buildings out there that don't appear to have damage do." 
</P>
<P>
 Steel industry officials emphasized that steel buildings are safe. "These 
structures found a way to survive despite these problems," said Nestor Iwankiw, 
director of research at the American Institute of Steel Construction. 
</P>
<P>
 Ray Remy, president of the Los Angeles Area Chamber of Commerce, said: "I 
think any property owner, particularly one hit hard by the earthquake, is well 
advised to follow the advice of the committee." 
</P>
<P>
 Remy said that having buildings inspected now improves chances that at least 
some of the costs will be defrayed by government programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Engineers have suggested that low-quality steel, badly designed beam-to-column 
connections or poorly executed welds could have led to the cracks. About a 
dozen of the 50 buildings required temporary or partial evacuations for 
repairs; the remainder are being fixed on weekends, Youssef said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, at the annual meeting of the Seismological Society of America in 
Pasadena, one expert estimated that some steel-frame buildings would collapse 
if a magnitude 7 earthquake struck directly underneath Downtown Los Angeles, 
which is a remote possibility. 
</P>
<P>
 John F. Hall, associate professor of civil engineering at Caltech, estimated 
that such a quake on the deeply buried Elysian Park thrust fault would collapse 
two 20-story steel-frame buildings, 30 four- to eight-story buildings and 150 
smaller ones. 
</P>
<P>
 "A significant fraction" of other steel-frame buildings, including some of the 
city's highest high-rises, would not collapse but would become "dysfunctional," 
Hall estimated, some with "noticeable story offsets," meaning that certain 
stories of the buildings would be bent out of vertical alignment, rendering 
them unusable. 
</P>
<P>
 Hall and Robert Englekirk, chief executive officer of the structural 
engineering firm of Englekirk & Sabol, cautioned that more study is needed 
before any precise upgrades can be prescribed for existing steel-frame 
buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 Englekirk noted that the steel industry is financing an unprecedented 
four-month study at the University of Texas to help determine what caused the 
cracks. Caltech seismologist Kerry Sieh said the interval between magnitude 7 
quakes under Downtown Los Angeles is probably 1,000 to 2,000 years. 
</P>
<P>
 But, he added, there are estimates that for the Los Angeles Basin as a whole, 
the interval between magnitude 7 earthquakes may be 100 to 300 years, and 
steel-frame high-rises are now common through much of the built-up areas within 
the basin. 
</P>
<P>
 The magnitude of the Jan. 17 Northridge earthquake has been put at 6.8, only 
half as powerful as a 7.0. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want people to panic," Tobin said. "But there is responsible action, 
and that is what we are pushing for. We believe strongly that (owners of) 
buildings with any reason to suspect something may be amiss seek competent 
advice." 
</P>

COLUMN ONE; A TRUE MASTER OF DISASTER; FOR JAMES LEE WITT, THE WORST OF TIMES 
HAVE BEEN THE BEST OF TIMES. IN HIS FIRST YEAR AS FEMA DIRECTOR, HE HAS REVIVED 
THE AILING AGENCY AND BROUGHT RELIEF TO CATASTROPHE VICTIMS ACROSS THE COUNTRY. 
</P>

<P>
 In his tumultuous first year as the federal government's disaster czar, James 
Lee Witt has survived a baptism by flood, wildfire, earthquake, ice storm and, 
most recently, tornado. 
</P>
<P>
 More important, he has rescued the Federal Emergency Management Agency from 
the edge of disaster, disarming lawmakers who suggested disbanding FEMA after 
its inept performance during Hurricane Andrew in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Inheriting an agency beset by criticism and sagging morale, Witt has begun to 
reform FEMA even as he has scrambled to cope with the nation's recent 
plague-like string of calamities. He has converted FEMA from a catastrophe 
itself into an operation that is able to coordinate disaster relief with 
striking cohesiveness and effectiveness. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't say enough good things about that guy," said Rep. Howard P. (Buck) 
McKeon (R-Santa Clarita), who represents the area at the epicenter of the 
Northridge earthquake and rarely flatters the Democratic Clinton 
Administration. "He's down to earth and he's a doer. There's no stuffiness 
about him, no ego about who's getting credit or who's doing what." 
</P>
<P>
 This agent of change is a soft-spoken, self-made man from Wildcat Hollow, 
Ark., who happens to be the first head of FEMA in its 14-year history with 
emergency management experience. He responds to cataclysms with a high-profile, 
hands-on style and a single-minded determination to assist victims as rapidly 
as possible. And, he enjoys extraordinary access to a President whose 
confidence he gained while they battled floods and tornadoes together in 
Arkansas. 
</P>
<P>
 Witt, who took charge of FEMA last April, has repeatedly demonstrated his 
mettle during Midwestern floods, Southern California fires, the tornadoes that 
cut a swath across the South last month and, most dramatically, amid the chaos 
caused by the Jan. 17 quake. 
</P>
<P>
 After the temblor, Witt seemed to be everywhere. He visited Red Cross shelters 
in the San Fernando Valley. He met with community leaders in South-Central Los 
Angeles. He toured Fillmore's stricken downtown. At each stop, he shook hands 
and expressed empathy and listened. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was just incredible," Witt said of the first frantic days. "When I visited 
the parks and Red Cross shelters, people were coming up to me and they were 
just grasping for something to give them hope and make them feel they'd be 
safe. There were several nights when I didn't sleep much. It really bothered me 
from a personal standpoint and it reinforced how critical it was for us to do 
whatever we could to help them and to do it as quickly as possible." 
</P>
<P>
 Three days after the quake, Witt faced the nightmarish prospect that FEMA's 
progress in the past year would be unraveled by the long lines of distraught 
and desperate victims who overwhelmed government aid workers. He was furious 
when he found that people had stood outside one application center in 
Northridge all day, only to be given an appointment to return three weeks 
later. 
</P>
<P>
 A red-faced Witt, clad in his trademark blue Windbreaker, blue jeans, 
ostrich-skin boots and white shirt, fumed to aides: "This is absolutely 
unacceptable. How come I wasn't notified this was going on? We can't have 
this." 
</P>
<P>
 Within two days, 1,800 workers -- some bilingual -- arrived from around the 
country. More disaster and telephone registration centers were opened and the 
FEMA application form was streamlined. A potentially explosive crisis was 
diffused. And FEMA was awarded high marks by local officials as well as quake 
victims. 
</P>
<P>
 Three months later, about 2,450 employees work seven days a week to process a 
record-shattering 500,000 aid requests. Complaints about computer glitches and 
ill-informed telephone operators have cropped up, but overall reviews remain 
positive. 
</P>
<P>
 Witt, 50, came to Washington with the new Administration. He had served as 
Arkansas' director of emergency services for the last four years of President 
Clinton's tenure as governor -- handling 38 tornadoes, snowstorms and floods. 
Before that, he was a judge in rural Yell County -- an administrative post that 
included disaster relief. 
</P>
<P>
 During his decade as a judge, Witt and his two sons would hop into his beloved 
'85 Chevy pickup in the middle of a stormy night to check the roads and 
bridges. He carried his duties so far that he'd get up from dinner to assist an 
elderly resident who needed groceries or a lift to the doctor, his sons recall. 
</P>
<P>
 In Washington, Witt took over an agency struggling with a dual purpose: to 
integrate the federal emergency preparedness and response duties dispersed 
throughout various departments and to ensure that the government could continue 
to operate after a nuclear attack. 
</P>
<P>
 FEMA was notorious as a dumping ground for political appointees. Outside 
reviews found that it lacked a clear mission, failed to respond quickly to 
disasters, had no strong link to the White House, was mired in bureaucracy and 
did not coordinate well with state and municipal governments and other federal 
agencies. And it became a political embarrassment for President George Bush 
when it mishandled Hurricane Andrew relief during his reelection campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 When Witt entered the $133,600-a-year job, his relationship with Clinton gave 
him a special standing with the White House that his predecessors lacked. Witt 
can reach the President directly and has the clout to oversee higher-ranking 
Cabinet officers at disaster sites. 
</P>
<P>
 His timing was good as well: The end of the Cold War freed him to shift FEMA's 
focus and resources from the classified national security operations to natural 
hazard response. 
</P>
<P>
 Upon his arrival, Witt was well aware that the ghost of Hurricane Andrew 
haunted the agency. After winds of 145 m.p.h. caused 40 deaths, seriously 
damaged 75,000 homes and inflicted $30 billion in damage in South Florida, FEMA 
was painfully slow to dispatch relief and, even then, appeared woefully 
ill-prepared. Miscommunication and confusion prevailed. 
</P>
<P>
 "The morale was very low," Witt recalled. "FEMA had taken a severe bashing 
with Hurricane Andrew and other things. Employees were literally ashamed to 
tell people they worked for FEMA. They'd say they worked for the federal 
government." 
</P>
<P>
 In an immediate effort to boost morale, he stood at the entrance to the 
agency's headquarters near the Capitol on his first day and shook the hand of 
every arriving worker. 
</P>
<P>
 He reorganized the agency, eliminating two layers of bureaucracy and giving 
employees on the national security staff dual roles in disaster preparedness or 
response. He met with state directors and vowed an end to the "us-versus-them" 
mentality that had characterized relations between state disaster chiefs and 
their FEMA counterparts. 
</P>
<P>
 And he adopted a new motto -- "People helping people" -- with the intent of 
driving home to his 2,216 employees that their prime responsibility is serving 
disaster victims. 
</P>
<P>
 His new ethos was quickly tested. When the Mississippi River overflowed last 
July, Witt was anxious to get to the scene. Eschewing the perks available to 
him, he took a commercial flight. When he missed a connection, he endured a 
midnight bus ride to Madison, Wis. Later that day, he announced that two dozen 
counties were federal disaster areas. 
</P>
<P>
 When wildfires raged through Southern California less than four months later, 
Witt arrived quickly -- the same day Clinton declared the region a federal 
disaster area. The FEMA director made two trips to the state and remained to 
coordinate aid for a total of six days. 
</P>
<P>
 Witt flew into Los Angeles the evening of the quake and stayed for 16 days -- 
often working nights. "He came in with his boots on," said a city official. 
</P>
<P>
 Some past critics of FEMA say Witt has renewed their hope in the agency's 
potential. 
</P>
<P>
 Cynthia Robbins is director of Urban Recovery Legal Assistance, a Los Angeles 
public interest group formed after the 1992 riots that sued FEMA over its 
handling of disaster aid. She and other advocates periodically talk to FEMA 
officials about how to make the agency more responsive to their communities. 
</P>
<P>
 "We really welcome the opportunity to have an ongoing dialogue," Robbins said. 
"There are a lot of challenges to meet. It's not whether or not problems will 
arise but what mechanisms exist to improve the response. Unequivocally, the 
communication is dramatically improved." 
</P>
<P>
 Witt has also taken steps to speed the process of rebuilding after a disaster. 
Disputes over reconstruction of damaged structures have dragged on for five 
years or more. This has slowed rehabilitation of San Francisco City Hall and 
Stanford University's main library after the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake and 
created protracted conflicts with Florida officials after Hurricane Andrew. 
Witt has recently moved to resolve these disagreements. 
</P>
<P>
 This new approach could have tremendous impact in Southern California, where 
3,500 public facilities owned by Los Angeles County alone cracked, crumbled and 
collapsed during the January quake. Damage estimates for public buildings thus 
far is $1.3 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Witt has given the state a green light to reinforce and retrofit buildings 
up-front rather than waiting up to two years for FEMA approval of grant 
applications. 
</P>
<P>
 A man of action rather than introspection, Witt will invariably recall tales 
of the dislocated and the grateful when asked to discuss the satisfaction he 
derives from his job. Quite simply, Witt says, this is what drives him: "I 
really do love my job 'cause I feel like I'm helping people." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Witt family goes back four generations in Wildcat Hollow, a remote, 
mountainous region. 
</P>
<P>
 The son of a farmer, Witt grew up in a home without electricity. His education 
ended with high school. He married young, had two sons and started his own 
small construction business. He is a longstanding member of the First Baptist 
Church in nearby Dardenelle. 
</P>
<P>
 Amid the dirt roads and the poultry farms, Witt still owns 220 acres to which 
he retreats to hunt and fish. He's a good shot with a Browning .270, friends 
say, and a veteran of bass fishing tournaments. This week he returned to relax 
by bush-hogging -- clearing brush and heavier undergrowth by pulling a device 
that resembles a giant lawn mower behind a tractor. 
</P>
<P>
 Witt is a trim, unprepossessing man with clear, blue eyes and a straight-arrow 
appearance. In contrast to his reputation as a dirt-under-the-nails commander 
at disaster scenes, in Washington, attired in his customary dark suit and tie, 
he is so low-key and self-effacing that he could easily pass as a captain in 
the capital's army of drab bureaucrats. 
</P>
<P>
 Friends and family say they expect Witt to remain at FEMA as long as Clinton 
is President, then to come home and possibly run for office -- perhaps a U.S. 
Senate seat. 
</P>
<P>
 For now, Witt faces the challenge of making long-term changes to reduce 
disaster costs and ensure that his reforms will outlast his tenure. He says he 
hopes to limit future destruction through improved construction methods as well 
as expanding flood and earthquake insurance to lower the staggering calamity 
bills to the government. 
</P>
<P>
 He recently told a House subcommittee that he plans to upgrade joint training 
exercises with state and local disaster operations. He's looking at incentives 
to encourage states to establish their own disaster relief funds -- as he and 
Clinton did in Arkansas. 
</P>
<P>
 Some, such as California Emergency Services Director Richard Andrews, say that 
Witt still must build "a team around him that shares his desire for change." 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Barbara A. Mikulski (D-Md.), who chairs a subcommittee that oversees 
FEMA's budget, pointedly told Witt at a recent hearing that "FEMA has a long 
way to go to really institutionalize and make permanent the changes you have 
begun to make." She also said there remains a need for "a long-term strategic 
plan." 
</P>
<P>
 Mikulski has sponsored a bill to overhaul the federal emergency operation. 
Among other things, the measure would create a special disaster response office 
in the White House headed by the vice president -- which an aide said Witt 
considers an unnecessary shift of authority. 
</P>
<P>
 Mikulski's bill would also slash the number of FEMA political appointees, 
upgrade the National Guard's role in disaster response and create interagency 
strike teams to do damage assessment. 
</P>
<P>
 "I sense major resistance from some quarters in the disaster response 
community to change, and from within the agency itself," Mikulski said.  
</P>
<P>
 Despite FEMA's improved emergency response, Mikulski warned Witt that, if she 
cannot make headway in restructuring the agency, she might move to fold it into 
the Department of Defense. 
</P>
<P>
 Witt said that his own reorganization efforts will address many of Mikulski's 
concerns.  
</P>
<P>
 He's made a believer out of Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.). She had been 
frustrated with FEMA's red tape after the Loma Prieta quake but was impressed 
with the can-do approach Witt brought to the wildfires and Northridge quake. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not that he's made the agency perfect," Boxer said. "But he wants to cut 
through bureaucracy more than any person I've ever seen." 
</P>
<P>
 Witt, typically, is quick to share credit with the other federal agencies and 
particularly California's well-equipped emergency services program. And, 
already, he's looking ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 "We did learn a great deal in California," Witt said, shortly after returning 
from his latest relief mission to the tornado-battered South. "The most 
important thing is that we came back with things we need to do."

PALESTINIAN KILLS ISRAELI, WOUNDS 4; TRAVEL CURBED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK FINEMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<P>
 A Palestinian extremist, armed with a submachine gun, fired on Israeli 
civilians and soldiers in a drive-by attack in the Israeli port city of Ashdod 
on Thursday, killing one person and wounding four. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident occurred even as the armed wing of a Palestinian fundamentalist 
group announced a campaign of terror, which it said would turn Israel and the 
occupied territories into a war zone in the next seven days. 
</P>
<P>
 The warning from the extremist group Hamas was contained in leaflets 
distributed in the territories. They said there would be four more attacks, 
including a rocket barrage, on Israeli targets in continuing retaliation for 
the Feb. 25 massacre of about 30 Palestinians in a Hebron mosque. 
</P>
<P>
 Later Thursday, another radical Islamic fundamentalist group took 
responsibility for the drive-by shooting, the second deadly Palestinian attack 
on Israeli civilians in two days. Islamic Jihad, which occasionally coordinates 
attacks with Hamas, said one of its members -- a Palestinian refugee from Gaza 
who was shot and killed by two Israeli bystanders during the Ashdod attack -- 
had acted in retaliation for the Hebron massacre. 
</P>
<P>
 The escalating violence came as Israel observed a morning moment of silence 
and reflection for its annual commemoration of the Holocaust. 
</P>
<P>
 In other developments Thursday: 
</P>
<P>
 * Within hours of the drive-by shooting, police issued a blanket order barring 
all Palestinians from traveling into Israel from the occupied territories, 
canceling thousands of special permits issued to Palestinian laborers in the 
weeks since the territories were sealed after the Hebron massacre. The new 
"comprehensive closure" took effect at 5 p.m. Thursday, and a police spokesman 
said it will continue "until further notice." 
</P>
<P>
 * Israeli families in the northern town of Afula angrily and tearfully buried 
teen-age girls, teachers and a bus driver who were among the eight killed and 
more than 45 wounded when a Hamas suicide-bomber blew up an Israeli passenger 
bus Wednesday -- an attack that Hamas said Thursday was just the opening salvo 
in a strategy to turn Israel's Independence Day next Thursday "into hell." 
</P>
<P>
 The Palestine Liberation Organization officially expressed regret and sent 
condolences to families of the victims of the Afula bus bombing. The PLO 
statement was criticized by some as insufficient. 
</P>
<P>
 * Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin's government resisted angry calls from the 
Israeli opposition to halt talks with the PLO on Palestinian autonomy. 
</P>
<P>
 * The government, citing security concerns, canceled a Palestinian conference 
at a Jerusalem hotel at which the Rev. Jesse Jackson was to speak. Security and 
Mourning 
</P>
<P>
 As family and friends in Afula left flowers at a charred bus stand Thursday 
and mourned with anger at funerals throughout the sleepy blue-collar town, some 
residents echoed Israel's political opposition in sharply criticizing the 
government. 
</P>
<P>
 One Afula resident, who identified herself as Ricki Sabag, told Israel Army 
Radio: "Rabin is a partner to this murder. . . . In my opinion, he must go home 
and free the post for people stronger than he." 
</P>
<P>
 At one point, Micha Goldman, Rabin's deputy education minister who represented 
the government at the Afula funerals, was cursed and attacked by several 
mourners. He was removed for his own safety after Goldman declared: "The 
government of Israel will not allow murderers -- the murderers of Israel, the 
murderers of peace -- any rest! We will pursue them ceaselessly." 
</P>
<P>
 The tone was markedly different, though equally pain-filled, among friends and 
family at the funeral of Ishai Gedassi. 
</P>
<P>
 He is the 31-year-old father of five who was gunned down Thursday morning 
while hitchhiking in Ashdod. As they laid the former soldier to rest at his 
kibbutz, Gedassi's friend Shlomo Anexter described him as "a central figure" in 
the struggle for peace. "He wanted peace. He was willing to do a lot for it," 
Anexter said. "I think that this was a little too much, though." 
</P>
<P>
 But Israel's top military leaders said there is little or nothing that can be 
done to stop terrorist killings. 
</P>
<P>
 Gen. Ehud Barak, Israel's chief of staff and its most senior military 
commander, said Wednesday's suicide bombing and Thursday's drive-by killing are 
terrorist acts impossible to avert. 
</P>
<P>
 He explained that the blanket security order he issued for the territories 
Thursday was a further attempt to defend against Hamas' vow of similar attacks 
to come. 
</P>
<P>
 But Palestinian leaders and Israeli human rights groups denounced as "unjust" 
the comprehensive closure order, which a spokesman for Israeli authorities in 
the West Bank said canceled nearly 20,000 special travel permits. 
</P>
<P>
 Only about 1,000 permits allowing passage "for humanitarian reasons" -- for 
individuals such as doctors, ambulance drivers and patients in need of special 
medical care -- will be exempted, said a spokesman for the Civil 
Administration, Israel's military authority in the West Bank. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think that the closure is an act of collective punishment -- it's not 
justified," declared B'tselem, the Israeli human rights group, adding that the 
security order has deprived tens of thousands of impoverished Palestinians of 
their only source of income in Israel. Israel and the PLO 
</P>
<P>
 As an official PLO announcement from Tunis, Tunisia, expressed regret for the 
continuing Palestinian violence against Israelis, Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin 
scheduled an emergency meeting of his Cabinet's security committee today.  
</P>
<P>
 Rabin also met for several hours with the Israeli delegation, which is in the 
final stages of negotiating an agreement with the PLO for Palestinian autonomy 
and Israeli withdrawal from the occupied Gaza Strip and the West Bank town of 
Jericho. 
</P>
<P>
 Rabin's government continued to resist mounting efforts by Israel's right-wing 
opposition and one of his own Cabinet members for an immediate suspension of 
the talks with the PLO. 
</P>
<P>
 "The government is responsible for the deterioration in the personal security 
of the citizens of Israel and for its unprecedented low point since the 
establishment of the state," declared Benjamin Netanyahu, chairman of the 
opposition Likud Party. 
</P>
<P>
 Rafael Eitan, who heads the opposition Tsomet Party, observed: "The government 
is paralyzed. It is the obligation of the government to immediately suspend the 
talks with the terrorists." 
</P>
<P>
 But several key government officials indicated that the Israeli delegation 
still plans to return to bargaining with the PLO at a scheduled session Sunday 
in Cairo. Only through a final agreement and concrete changes in the 
territories, they said, can the government neutralize the threat from armed 
extremists who are trying to destroy the peace process. 
</P>
<P>
 Expressing "sorrow" over Arafat's initial silence amid the carnage, Foreign 
Minister Shimon Peres, a chief architect of the peace process, said after an 
emergency meeting of the ruling Labor Party, "We have to be clear: Just as we 
will not hesitate to employ every method against terrorism, we will not stop 
for a minute the negotiations for an agreement on Gaza and Jericho." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the government's commitment to the peace process, there was almost 
universal Israeli condemnation of Arafat's failure to condemn or even comment 
publicly on the continuing slaughter of Israelis by Hamas -- a rival 
Palestinian faction that opposes Arafat's Fatah faction and his peace efforts 
with Israel.

HOSOKAWA TO RESIGN AS JAPANESE PREMIER; ASIA: HE APOLOGIZES TO NATION FOR 
CONTROVERSY OVER HIS PERSONAL FINANCES. PARLIAMENT HAD BEEN AT IMPASSE OVER 
DISPUTE. HIS COALITION TOOK POWER LAST YEAR AFTER 38 YEARS OF LIBERAL 
DEMOCRATIC RULE. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, beleaguered by a controversy over his 
personal finances, announced today that he intends to resign. 
</P>
<P>
 Hosokawa, who took over last August after 38 years of unbroken rule by the 
Liberal Democratic Party, said he will step down because of an impasse in 
Parliament over charges that he received an illicit $952,000 payment from a 
gangster-tainted parcel-delivery firm. 
</P>
<P>
 Hosokawa called the transactions "something for which I must take moral 
responsibility." 
</P>
<P>
 "I apologize and ask for your understanding," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hosokawa would be the fourth of Japan's last five prime ministers to step down 
because of scandal. 
</P>
<P>
 Hosokawa, 56, insisted that he received the money in 1982 as a loan and that 
he had repaid the money in full by 1991. Liberal Democrats, however, began a 
boycott of parliamentary proceedings to demand that Hosokawa allow his former 
secretary to testify in Parliament to clarify details. 
</P>
<P>
 The prime minister had been trying to win approval of an already overdue 
budget for the fiscal year that started a week ago, but the scandal had 
paralyzed parliamentary business. 
</P>
<P>
 In a nationally televised news conference, Hosokawa revealed that he had just 
discovered an incident that occurred more than 10 years ago in which staff 
members in his office had entrusted Hosokawa's own personal funds for 
"investment" to a friend. 
</P>
<P>
 The prime minister said he could not reveal the details now but admitted that 
the incident involves "legal problems." 
</P>
<P>
 "As a politician, I must straighten my collar," Hosokawa said. 
</P>
<P>
 He also admitted for the first time that he had not paid interest on the 
controversial loan. Instead, funds represented by the interest payments were 
reported, legally, as political contributions, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Socialist Chairman Tomiichi Murayama told reporters that "with the Parliament 
this stagnated and no outlook in sight for movement, Hosokawa said he felt he 
had to assume responsibility." 
</P>
<P>
 Yuichi Ichikawa, chairman of the the Buddhist-backed Komei (Clean Government) 
Party, said the prime minister told the leaders he had no problems to face on 
the loan from the Sagawa Kyubin Co. But he quoted Hosokawa as admitting that he 
had discovered "some legal problems" with "the management of my political 
funds." 
</P>
<P>
 Murayama and Ichikawa were interviewed as they emerged from "consultations" 
that Hosokawa called with coalition party leaders. When Murayama said the prime 
minister told the leaders that he intended to resign, reporters exclaimed: "The 
prime minister resign?!" 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after the meeting with his coalition partners, Hosokawa convened a 
meeting of his Cabinet ministers to inform them of his decision. 
</P>
<P>
 Masayoshi Takemura, chief Cabinet secretary, said no date has been set for a 
resignation by the Cabinet as a whole. A Cabinet resignation, required any time 
a prime minister quits, could precipitate a general election. However, reports 
that Hosokawa is accepting personal responsibility did not point toward an 
election. 
</P>
<P>
 The approval of the lower house of Parliament is needed to elect a new prime 
minister. 
</P>
<P>
 The announcement, although it came after a series of mishaps and failures by 
Hosokawa, left politicians so astonished that no one was yet making predictions 
of what will happen. 
</P>
<P>
 At the least, Hosokawa's resignation was expected to seriously impair the 
government in its efforts to work out a market-opening package of measures to 
lift government regulations on business by June and further spur a faltering 
economy that achieved only 0.1% growth last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Hosokawa had promised the action before a Naples, Italy, summit of the Group 
of Seven advanced industrialized democracies, at which he was to have met 
President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 Hosokawa and Clinton met in February but failed to agree on measures to cut 
Japan's growing trade surpluses. The episode brought U.S.-Japan economic 
relations to a new level of tension. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first five minutes after Hosokawa's resignation became known, the Tokyo 
Stock Exchange fell 150 points. The yen also dipped on the foreign exchange 
market. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1989, when then-Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita suddenly resigned in the 
midst of the Recruit Co. stocks-for-favors scandal, the process of selecting a 
new prime minister consumed more than a month, even though it only involved 
selecting another Liberal Democrat as the leader. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, with a coalition backed by eight parties in the upper house and 
seven in the lower chamber of Parliament, the process promises to be more 
complicated. 
</P>
<P>
 One possibility is Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata, leader of the Japan Renewal 
Party, the second-largest in the coalition. 
</P>
<P>
 Late last July, Hosokawa patched together his coalition under a banner of 
political reform and opposition to the perennial rule of the Liberal Democrats 
and a chain of scandals under their governments. 
</P>
<P>
 Although left-wing Socialists sabotaged the coalition's political reform bills 
in the upper house in January, Hosokawa hammered out a compromise with Yohei 
Kono, who took over the leadership of the Liberal Democrats after former Prime 
Minister Kiichi Miyazawa resigned. Bills to put into force the reforms and a 
new electoral system were passed last month. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, Hosokawa has stumbled on one issue after another. 
</P>
<P>
 In February, he announced a plan to raise a 3% consumption tax to 7% three 
years after cutting income taxes by 20% -- without informing his coalition 
partners. A day later, after the Socialists threatened to withdraw from the 
coalition, he rescinded the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Unprepared because of preoccupation with the political reforms, Hosokawa said 
no to Clinton's demands for market opening -- a move that initially brought him 
praise. But his failure to come up with substantial counterproposals later 
subjected him to criticism. 
</P>
<P>
 The prime minister's troubles reached a peak, however, when his repeated 
attempts to explain the money he received from Sagawa Kyubin fell on 
increasingly skeptical listeners. His opinion poll ratings fell as low as 47%, 
compared to more than 70% last summer. And the mass media, which had backed him 
solidly, began writing ever more critical editorials, urging him to clear up 
the facts of the loan. 
</P>
<P>
 In the last few days, newspapers began running summaries of Hosokawa's 
administration -- as if they were writing political obituaries.

IT'S A VOTE AGAINST MOTHERHOOD, SAYS REBUFFED CANDIDATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JENIFER WARREN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Zoe Lofgren is the proud parent of two kids. So when she filed papers for a 
run for Congress recently, she included mother in the blank where candidates 
describe their occupation for the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 Much to her surprise, election officials balked. Although Lofgren may indeed 
be a mother, it seems that saying so on the California ballot is against the 
law. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're telling me motherhood is not a job," said Lofgren, who, incidentally, 
is also a full-time politician -- a Santa Clara County supervisor -- when she's 
not making sandwiches or helping her kids with their homework. "As any mother 
will tell you, it is a job -- 24 hours a day." 
</P>
<P>
 Lofgren is the latest in a long parade of California candidates who have 
struck out with their chosen ballot description. Her dilemma, says acting 
Secretary of State Tony Miller, illustrates a "troubling problem" with 
elections law, one he would like to change. 
</P>
<P>
 Under rules adopted more than 60 years ago, candidates' ballot designations 
may refer only to their "principal professions, occupations or vocations." A 
person's less conventional description -- be it mother, patriot, wage slave or 
non-meat eater -- doesn't qualify. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller, a candidate himself this year, believes the rules are unfairly strict 
and do a disservice to voters. As long as candidates are truthful, he says, 
they should be permitted to describe themselves however they please. 
</P>
<P>
 "If a person thinks being a mother is important to her candidacy, why 
shouldn't she be allowed to put that down?" said Miller, who is running for the 
job he inherited when March Fong Eu resigned to become ambassador to 
Micronesia. "That piece of information might be important in a voter's 
decision." 
</P>
<P>
 Lofgren, 46, heartily agrees, and has written letters to leaders of the state 
Legislature, asking that the law be changed. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems to me that being a parent is probably the most important job to the 
future of our country," she said. "If the law says that doesn't count, the law 
is wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 California is one of only a few states that permit all candidates to describe 
themselves on the ballot, according to the Federal Election Commission. Miller 
said the practice, initiated by the Legislature in 1931, was originally 
intended to help candidates with similar names distinguish themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 As any political strategist will attest, the art of crafting ballot 
descriptions has evolved considerably since then. In many races -- particularly 
those with a crowd of candidates lacking the money to wage high-profile 
campaigns -- the ballot designation can serve as a powerful, last-minute 
advertisement. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is unquestionably a very important item," said H. Eric Schockman, a 
political scientist at USC's Unruh Institute of Politics. "Especially when the 
voter is confronted with a bunch of unknowns, the title they see beside the 
name on their ballot can be the deciding factor that sways their vote." 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, wars over what's legal and what's not can be fierce. Each 
election year, the secretary of state decides scores of disputes over ballot 
designations, many of which wind up in court. 
</P>
<P>
 Frequently, such disputes are sparked by a candidate who challenges an 
opponent's designation. Unless a description is illegal on its face -- like the 
broad description mother -- the secretary of state certifies it, relying on 
watchful competitors to make a stink if something is amiss. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, Miller's designation was challenged this year by his opponent, 
former Los Angeles City Councilman Mike Woo. Woo argued that the title acting 
secretary state was illegal because Miller had never been elected or appointed 
to the job of secretary of state. Woo lost in court. 
</P>
<P>
 In another case, Tom McClintock, a former Thousand Oaks assemblyman running 
for state controller, won the right to describe himself as taxpayer advocate. 
Miller had barred the designation, noting that he routinely denies the use of 
gun-control advocate or anti-abortion advocate, but a judge reversed that 
decision because McClintock works full time as director of the Center for the 
California Taxpayer. 
</P>
<P>
 As for Lofgren, she will not take her fight to court, preferring to push for a 
change in the law. Lofgren says her decision to use mother -- as well as county 
supervisor -- in her ballot description stems from her belief that children and 
their needs are not receiving sufficient attention from the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
 Others, however, take a more cynical view, speculating that Lofgren -- a 
veteran politician -- may have sought to use mother in a calculated attempt to 
dilute her image as a political insider. 
</P>
<P>
 "To me, it seems as if she's disowning her incumbency to pander to those who 
want to see innocent mothers in the political process," Schockman said. "Being 
a mother is an honored and valid profession. But for her to play it both ways 
seems disingenuous." 
</P>
<P>
 To those who question her motives, Lofgren responds, "Hey, if there's 
something wrong with saying you're a mother when you are . . . then I'm 
guilty." 
</P>
<P>
 Lofgren is a candidate in one of California's most interesting and competitive 
congressional primaries, the fight to succeed retiring San Jose Rep. Don 
Edwards. But so far, her leading opponent in the Democratic primary has stayed 
above the fray. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think mother is a pretty admirable title, and if she wants to use it, she 
should be allowed to," said former San Jose Mayor Tom McEnery. Just for the 
record, however, McEnery adds that he is the very proud father of three 
daughters. 
</P>
<P>
 Even before the Lofgren squabble surfaced, Miller said he was convinced the 
rules governing ballot descriptions should be changed. In the past, however, 
the Legislature has shown little interest in doing so. 
</P>
<P>
 That may be because the current system tends to favor incumbents, Miller said. 
Although outsiders are permitted only a three-word ballot designation, 
incumbents are allowed an unlimited number of words to describe their office. 
</P>
<P>
 "So you might get something like Assembly member, California Assembly, 19th 
Assembly district," Miller said. "A lot of people believe that the more words 
in your title, the more impressive it looks. So that's an unfair advantage."

4 CHILDREN DIE AFTER CHICKENPOX; HEALTH: CAUSE OF DEATH MAY HAVE BEEN A RESULT 
OF ACCOMPANYING STREP INFECTIONS. OFFICIALS ARE MONITORING CASES.

 Four children -- three in Orange County and one in Los Angeles -- who died 
within the last two weeks after what appeared to be routine cases of chickenpox 
may have suffered complications from a severe bacterial infection, according to 
health officials in both counties. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the four who died, at least 23 other children with chickenpox 
have been struck with similar but nonfatal bacterial infections this year in 
the two counties. In the past two weeks alone, one Los Angeles hospital has 
reported 15 such infections -- the same number that occurred during all of last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not unusual for us to have one or two deaths due to chickenpox in a 
year," said Dr. Hildy Meyers of the Orange County Health Care Agency. "This is 
something we are concerned about, but whether we are starting an epidemic or 
not, we can't say." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Dr. Shirley Fannin, director of disease control programs for Los Angeles 
County: "This may be relatively early in the problem, or we may be seeing the 
peak. We don't know yet. . . . This seems to be more cases in a shorter period 
of time. That is unusual." 
</P>
<P>
 The streptococcal infection, which typically can cause illnesses such as strep 
throat and pneumonia, probably entered into the children's bloodstreams through 
lesions resulting from the chickenpox infections, the health agency doctors 
said. Fannin described it as an "unfortunate coincidence" that both the 
chickenpox virus and the strep infections appear to be occurring in the same 
population at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts advise parents to keep a close eye on children who have chickenpox, 
and to check with a doctor if the children have long-lasting high fever or do 
not appear to be recovering as quickly as expected. Washing children's skin 
with antibacterial soap may also help prevent the streptococcal bacteria from 
invading the chickenpox lesions, Fannin said. 
</P>
<P>
 The identities of the children recently struck with the infection were not 
made public. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the three Orange County children who died, a streptococcal infection has 
been confirmed as the cause of death only in the case of a 2-year-old Santa Ana 
girl who died on Sunday. A 5-year-old girl died on March 24. In Los Angeles 
County, laboratory tests have not yet confirmed that the child who died had the 
streptococcal infection, but Fannin said officials are certain that is the 
cause. 
</P>
<P>
 The most recent death was that of an 18-month-old San Juan Capistrano girl who 
died Tuesday. It is not known if the streptococcal infection was in her blood. 
Test results are not yet available. 
</P>
<P>
 "She had chickenpox for four or five days, then developed a fever and became 
unresponsive later," Meyers said. 
</P>
<P>
 Reports of the Orange County deaths prompted Los Angeles County officials to 
survey the area's pediatric hospitals. They found that over the past two weeks, 
Childrens Hospital-Los Angeles has seen 15 children who have had both 
chickenpox and the streptococcal infection. Another hospital has seen four 
cases, Fannin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Severe streptococcal infections are on the rise throughout the United States 
among people of all ages and are not always linked to chickenpox. The 
infections can be inexplicably lethal for some people and not for others, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The infections often can be treated with antibiotics, but there is little that 
can be done in some cases, Meyers said. "These complications are relatively 
rare and are something you read about in medical textbooks," Meyers said. "It 
doesn't invariably lead to death. In some people it just takes a drastic 
course."

MEDICINE / AIDS RESEARCH; STUDY SUGGESTS AIDS VIRUS CAN CAUSE CANCER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHERYL STOLBERG, TIMES MEDICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Researchers at UC San Francisco say they have found the first evidence that 
the human immunodeficiency virus, which causes AIDS, also can cause cancer 
rather than simply make patients susceptible by weakening their immune system. 
</P>
<P>
 In a study involving just four AIDS patients with what may be a previously 
undiscovered form of lymphoma, the scientists reported that the virus had 
inserted itself into the DNA of malignant tumors, lodging next to a 
cancer-causing gene. They theorize that the virus activated this "oncogene," 
spawning the malignancy. Top experts, however, are skeptical of the findings. 
</P>
<P>
 Although lymphoma, or cancer of the lymph system, is common among AIDS 
patients, previous studies have shown that the cancer is not directly caused by 
HIV but occurs because the virus depresses the immune system. If the San 
Francisco research proves correct, it would mark the first time that scientists 
have shown that HIV is a direct cause of cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a totally different perspective of what HIV can do," said Dr. Michael 
McGrath, the senior author of the study, which will appear next week in the 
journal Cancer Research. 
</P>
<P>
 If the research is confirmed, the study could have broad implications for the 
treatment of AIDS patients and also the development of an AIDS vaccine. The 
findings suggest that even if effective treatments for AIDS are developed, 
those who have HIV could still develop cancer years after being infected with 
the virus. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it's correct, I think its very important," said Dr. Irvin Chen, director 
of the UCLA AIDS Institute. "But I'm a little skeptical of the data." 
</P>
<P>
 The type of lymphoma tumors McGrath and his colleagues studied have never 
before been identified and contain different properties than those typically 
found in AIDS patients. Dr. Alexandra Levine, an expert in AIDS-related cancers 
at USC, said it is possible that what the San Francisco team believes is 
lymphoma is not a malignancy but simply an abnormal reaction to HIV. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't believe they have proven in any sense that they have found a new kind 
of cancer," Levine said. "It's a scientific curiosity that warrants further 
study, but they are not discussing classic AIDS lymphoma." 
</P>
<P>
 In nearly all AIDS patients who have lymphoma, the malignant tumors are 
"monoclonal" -- meaning they are derived from one type of cell, almost always a 
B-cell, an immune system cell that makes antibodies. A small number of cases -- 
between 35 and 50 -- have been identified in which the cancer derives from 
other immune system cells, called T-cells. 
</P>
<P>
 But at San Francisco General Hospital, McGrath said, doctors have been seeing 
an increasing number of lymphomas that are "polyclonal" -- derived from a 
collection of B-cells, T-cells and also macrophages, a third type of immune 
system cells. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the past decade, McGrath said, he has seen 280 patients with this unusual 
form of lymphoma. Today, he said, nearly a third of all the hospital's patients 
with AIDS-related lymphoma have strains that are not derived from B-cells. 
</P>
<P>
 His team tested tissue from 30 such patients. In four, they reported finding 
evidence that HIV had integrated itself into the genetic material of the 
tissue, always in the same spot, next to the cancer-causing gene. Since that 
time, McGrath said, he has identified three more patients who fit this profile. 
</P>
<P>
 How frequently this occurs remains unclear. But the study suggests it takes 
years for this type of lymphoma to develop. As the AIDS epidemic moves into its 
second decade and HIV-infected people continue to live longer, more cases are 
likely to emerge, McGrath said. 
</P>
<P>
 If the findings are confirmed, they could prove detrimental to efforts to 
develop an AIDS vaccine, according to Dr. William Blattner, chief of viral 
epidemiology at the National Cancer Institute. 
</P>
<P>
 With several vaccine candidates failing to live up to their initial promise, 
Blattner noted that the best prospects may lie with a "live attenuated 
vaccine," formulated with a live, although weakened, form of the AIDS virus. 
But many scientists fear that a live virus vaccine would be too dangerous, and 
the San Francisco study may enhance those fears. 
</P>
<P>
 In other AIDS research, the final results of the controversial Concorde study 
were published Thursday and confirmed preliminary findings reported a year ago: 
The drug AZT does not delay the onset of AIDS when given to patients who are 
infected with HIV but have not yet shown any symptoms. 
</P>
<P>
 AZT has been shown effective in prolonging the life of patients with 
full-blown AIDS, and previous studies have suggested it was beneficial to give 
the drug to patients before they showed symptoms. The Concorde study has cast 
doubt on the earlier research and generated great debate among doctors about 
when to prescribe AZT.

SENATE VOTES TO REPEAL INMATE 'BILL OF RIGHTS'; PENAL SYSTEM: TARGETED 
PRIVILEGES INCLUDE RECEIPT OF PORNOGRAPHY AND RACIST WRITINGS. ASSEMBLY MAY 
TEMPER ACTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The state Senate voted overwhelmingly Thursday to repeal the "bill of rights" 
for state prison inmates, a reform enacted nearly 20 years ago that critics 
assert grants criminals too many privileges. 
</P>
<P>
 Targeted for repeal by the Senate bill are privileges that allow inmates to 
receive, produce and sell pornography and to receive racist writings. 
</P>
<P>
 Families of prisoners fear that conjugal and other personal visits with 
prisoners would be jeopardized by the legislation. Supporters of repeal say 
that is not their intent, noting that visitation rights are an important tool 
for managing prison tensions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Visiting, for the most part, will not be affected," said the author, Sen. 
Robert B. Presley (D-Riverside). He noted that prisoners would continue to have 
the protection of the federal and state constitutions. 
</P>
<P>
 A 30-1 vote sent the bill to the Assembly, where some of its provisions may be 
tempered to conform more closely to federal standards. 
</P>
<P>
 A bill similar to Presley's, by Assemblyman Dean Andal (R-Stockton), which had 
been diluted in committee, awaits a vote on the Assembly floor. Gov. Pete 
Wilson has endorsed both election-year proposals as part of his program to get 
tougher on criminals. 
</P>
<P>
 Echoing the complaints of crime victims, Presley said inmate privileges that 
were written into California law during the mid-1970s go beyond rights 
contained in the state or federal constitutions. 
</P>
<P>
 These include the right to sell real estate or personal property, including 
"written and artistic" materials. Prisoners also may buy, receive, read and 
share with others publications acceptable to the Postal Service. Additionally, 
they are assured of the "civil right" to personal visits. 
</P>
<P>
 Crime victims organizations contend that the bill of rights law extends 
special privileges to criminals who have denied fundamental human rights to 
their victims. They deplore conjugal visits as "sex at taxpayer expense." 
</P>
<P>
 But Sen. Diane Watson (D-Los Angeles) argued that the repeal was too sweeping. 
She said she supports outlawing "onerous businesses" and pornography in prison, 
but argued against a wholesale rejection of the law. 
</P>
<P>
 "Prisoners perform better when they are allowed to have contact with their 
loved ones," said Watson, who did not vote. She warned that denying inmates 
"minimum human rights" while they are locked up could jeopardize public safety 
when they are released.

THE WASHINGTON CONNECTION / GLENN F. BUNTING: FIGHTING FOR A SLICE OF SMALLER 
TRANSIT PIE 
</P>

 Illustrating an era when Congress handed out lucrative federal projects left 
and right, a dozen portraits of distinctive dams, bridges and airports line the 
oak-paneled walls of the House Public Works and Transportation Committee room. 
</P>
<P>
 The pictures feature sweeping views of the Amoskeag Memorial Bridge in 
Manchester, N.H., the futuristic Dulles International Airport terminal, the 
picturesque Little Goose Walk and Dam over the Snake River and the vast Poe 
Locks serving the Great Lakes region. 
</P>
<P>
 Many projects were built decades ago at a cost of hundreds of millions of 
dollars apiece when a robust national economy fueled growth in communities 
large and small. In those days, many members of Congress considered it their 
duty to divert massive amounts of government funds to their home districts and 
states. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Congress has precious few dollars to build bridges, dams, airports and 
interstates. But as three long days of congressional hearings held last month 
in the high-ceilinged committee room demonstrate, House members have no qualms 
about scrapping over the crumbs. 
</P>
<P>
 About 220 witnesses appeared before the Subcommittee on Surface Transportation 
to request special consideration for funding in fiscal year 1995. The parade of 
witnesses included nearly 100 House members seeking money for more than 200 
projects. One estimate placed the total dollar amount of requests at 30 times 
greater than the transportation funds that will be available next year. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 California, with eight of 63 members on the full committee, was 
well-represented at the hearings. About 20 members of the congressional 
delegation joined with local and state officials to lobby for everything from 
park-and-ride lots in Sonoma County to improvements on Bristol Street in Santa 
Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 Some argued that local highway projects were needed to save lives. Others did 
their best to leave a lasting impression with Subcommittee Chairman Nick J. 
Rahall II (D-W. Va.), who chaired the hearings. Rep. Sam Farr (D-Carmel), a 
freshman Democrat, wore a necktie depicting brightly colored trains while 
asking for $4.75 million in engineering studies to build a coastal rail 
commuter line in Santa Cruz County. After finishing his remarks, Farr pressed a 
button on the tie that blared "I've Been Working on the Railroad" over the 
sound system. The music elicited a prolonged groan from Rahall. 
</P>
<P>
 The most impressive show of political support came from a bipartisan group of 
15 congressional, state and local elected officials. They pushed for $170 
million to help build a rail-and-truck corridor that would connect the Los 
Angeles and Long Beach harbors to Union Station. The presentation, which 
included a four-minute slide show, slick color brochures and backing from the 
state's two U.S. senators, several Los Angeles-area House members and Mayor 
Richard Riordan, promoted the $1.8-billion project known as the Alameda 
Corridor as an economic boon for Southern California and the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the least effective lobbying effort was turned in by Los Angeles area 
officials seeking to extend the Long Beach Freeway through South Pasadena. They 
were joined at the witness table by opponents of the controversial proposal, 
and the testimony quickly deteriorated into a heated debate. As a result, the 
project is given virtually no chance of receiving funding. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The public hearings are considered an integral part of the legislative process 
because they ensure that everyone gets a fair shot at pitching their local 
projects. The crucial decisions, however, will be made far from public view and 
influenced heavily by Rep. Norman Y. Mineta, the San Jose Democrat who heads 
the full public works committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Mineta was like a king overlooking his court. Each time a group finished 
speaking, Rahall deferred to Mineta, who would thank the witnesses profusely 
while citing the lack of funds. Sometimes, Mineta would offer an opinion on a 
particular project. 
</P>
<P>
 When Rep. Jerry Lewis (R-Redlands) sought a highway extension in his San 
Bernardino-Riverside district, Mineta noted that he would personally see to it 
that some funds were delivered. The reason, Mineta explained, is that his 
mother-in-law lives in Lewis' district. 
</P>
<P>
 After hearing the elaborate appeal for the Alameda Corridor, Mineta appeared 
to give his stamp of approval. The California delegation walked away upbeat, 
thinking it had cleared an early hurdle. 
</P>
<P>
 But Mineta is making no promises. "I think there may be some overoptimism 
there," he said. "I've got to look at this total picture from a national 
perspective."

ZEDILLO FOLLOWS TRADITION IN LAUNCHING CAMPAIGN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUANITA DARLING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ernesto Zedillo, the presidential candidate of Mexico's ruling party, launched 
his campaign Thursday with a Mexican political tradition: He visited his 
hometown, Mexicali. 
</P>
<P>
 But throughout his first day of persuading voters of his merits, Zedillo also 
confronted stark reminders that his will not be a traditional campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides getting started barely four months before the Aug. 21 elections, the 
Zedillo campaign confronts dissension within his party and the long shadow of 
the assassination of his predecessor, Luis Donaldo Colosio. Colosio's March 23 
murder, which occurred as the candidate left a campaign rally in Tijuana, is 
still under investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 The morning before arriving in this border town, Zedillo left wreaths at 
Colosio's grave in the northern village of Magdalena de Kino and at the Tijuana 
assassination site, where he spent just eight minutes under intense security 
and made no public statements. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, he traveled to a luxury Tijuana hotel, where he met with local 
political leaders and a handful of newspaper editors. 
</P>
<P>
 That gathering site contrasted sharply with Zedillo's first stop in Mexicali, 
Colonia Pueblo Nuevo, a neighborhood of graffiti-covered single-story concrete 
houses where he lived as a child. 
</P>
<P>
 Dressed in an olive jacket and casual slacks, Zedillo occasionally reached 
through the circle of security guards to shake hands with onlookers as he 
walked along the unpaved street to his old home. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, before a crowd of about 1,500 in the municipal auditorium, Zedillo said 
that growing up in a working-class neighborhood taught him that "our most 
important commitment is to those who have the least." 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier in the day, outspoken Mexico City Councilman Demetrio Sodi made it 
clear that Zedillo faces a split in the Institutional Revolutionary Party, 
known as the PRI, that has ruled Mexico for 65 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Sodi, a 19-year PRI veteran, quit the party Thursday over Zedillo's 
nomination, which was essentially the unilateral choice of outgoing President 
Carlos Salinas de Gortari. 
</P>
<P>
 Other democracy-minded party activists, notably the Democracy 2000 movement, 
have also threatened to resign over the nomination, but Sodi is the first to 
actually do so. 
</P>
<P>
 Zedillo has responded indirectly to such threats by invoking the name of the 
slain candidate to call for party unity in speeches and in the few interviews 
he has granted. 
</P>
<P>
 The rally here included a moment of silence for Colosio, and Zedillo began his 
remarks by saying he is carrying on for his fallen friend. 
</P>
<P>
 But the frequent tributes to Colosio, victim of Mexico's most shocking 
political murder in 66 years, have begun to provoke criticism from opposition 
parties. The weekly magazine Proceso said in its latest issue that Zedillo 
remains in Colosio's shadow. 
</P>
<P>
 Concern about such criticism was the reason Zedillo excluded the reporters 
traveling with him from the grave and murder site visits, a campaign source 
said.

MUSLIMS BALK AT PEACE TALK WITH SERBS; BOSNIA: GOVERNMENT IS ANGERED BY WESTERN 
INDIFFERENCE AS EASTERN ENCLAVE OF GORAZDE IS POUNDED BY ENEMY ARTILLERY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Angered by Western indifference to the biggest Serb rebel offensive in months, 
the Muslim-led government refused Thursday to discuss a proposed U.N. 
cease-fire with its enemies while they continued attacking the threatened 
eastern enclave of Gorazde. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Bosnian government did announce a 24-hour unilateral cease-fire as a 
"goodwill gesture," according to local media. U.N. sources cautioned that a 
lasting truce would only come out of negotiations between the two sides' 
military leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, Lt. Gen. Michael Rose of Britain, the U.N. commander in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, shuttled between government army headquarters here and a 
Serb rebel base just outside Sarajevo to press his plan for bringing a halt to 
the fighting. 
</P>
<P>
 But as Rose encountered resistance on both sides to the latest attempt to 
restore peace through diplomacy, Serb gunmen encircling Gorazde fired heavy 
artillery shells into the town center, and Bosnian Serb war lord Radovan 
Karadzic warned that he might order an all-out offensive against the enclave. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the Muslims do not immediately stop their offensive along all 
confrontation lines, we will order an all-out counteroffensive and then let the 
Security Council help them," Karadzic was quoted by state-run Belgrade radio as 
saying. 
</P>
<P>
 Karadzic has insisted in his talks with U.N. officials that his forces' attack 
on Gorazde has been in response to an assault by government troops inside the 
enclave who are surrounded and outgunned. 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. sources say Karadzic's claim of a Muslim offensive out of Gorazde is 
patently untrue, although some government maneuvers have been reported 
elsewhere in Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
 Aid workers for the Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees in 
Gorazde reported regular shelling, said Kris Janowski, the agency's Sarajevo 
spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost 400 people have been killed or wounded in the offensive against 
Gorazde, the U.N. refugee agency reported. 
</P>
<P>
 In his talks with Rose, Bosnian army commander Gen. Rasim Delic insisted that 
Serb forces withdraw from the territory recently seized around Gorazde before 
he would agree to meet with the Serbs to discuss a general cease-fire. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Bosnian Serb commander, Gen. Ratko Mladic, refused to consider such a 
concession, according to U.N. sources. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am disappointed that the war will go on as long as we continue to debate on 
this level," Rose told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 The government had been hoping that Rose would insist on going to Gorazde, 
expecting that a first-hand view of the beleaguered conditions in the 
refugee-packed city of 65,000 would prod the United Nations to protect the town 
that was proclaimed a U.N.-protected "safe haven" nearly a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 French Gen. Philippe Morillon, one of Rose's predecessors as Bosnian U.N. 
commander, last year marshaled a fierce defense of another eastern enclave, 
Srebrenica, when it was on the verge of being overrun by the Serbs. Rose was 
turned back by Serb gunmen when he tried to visit Gorazde on Wednesday. He said 
he would make another attempt Saturday, but has since suggested that the 
cease-fire talks should take priority. 
</P>
<P>
 The 10-day-old Serb assault on Gorazde, at a time when foreign mediators were 
claiming significant progress toward peace, reflects uncertainty among Serb 
rebel commanders about their precarious position in negotiations, now that 
Bosnia's Muslims and Croats have reconciled. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials brokered the March 1 truce and pushed the two communities to 
create a new Bosnian federation that has been promised at least 51% of this 
former Yugoslav republic's territory. But the Croats and Muslims now hold less 
than 30%, making the federation's success contingent on the Serbs' withdrawal 
from much of the land they have conquered. 
</P>
<P>
 Serbs so far have shown no interest in joining the peace talks mediated by 
U.S. and Russian officials, fearing that they would be pressured into ceding 
territory. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, they have stepped up a terror campaign against the few remaining 
Croats and Muslims in northwestern Bosnia and launched the offensive that has 
moved the rebels deep into the Gorazde enclave. 
</P>
<P>
 Rose has sought to play down the severity of the Serb attack on Gorazde, 
saying it appeared to be a strategic move to strengthen the rebels' position in 
future peace talks. 
</P>
<P>
 After blocking Rose from going to Gorazde, Serb leaders asked him to call a 
meeting between the two sides' military commanders to consider a Bosnia-wide 
truce. 
</P>
<P>
 Government officials here contend that the Serbs' appeal for new talks is 
simply a delaying tactic to allow them to press their assault on Gorazde 
without U.N. interference -- a claim given some credibility by the failure of 
Mladic, the Bosnian Serb commander, to show up for the airport meeting that 
Karadzic insisted Rose arrange. 
</P>
<P>
 Rose sought to put the best face on his failure to bring either side to 
discuss a cease-fire. His staff issued a statement saying Rose had presented 
both sides with a draft cease-fire plan and was giving them a "brief period for 
reflection." 
</P>
<P>
 But the statement made clear that both government and Serb military commanders 
still refuse to meet face-to-face, casting doubt on the prospects for an 
imminent breakthrough.

U.S. WON'T USE AIR POWER TO STOP GORAZDE ATTACKS; MILITARY: BUT OFFICIALS 
SUGGEST SOME U.N. FORCES MIGHT ARRIVE AT THE BESIEGED BOSNIA CITY SOON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The Clinton Administration said Thursday that it would not be willing to use 
U.S. air power to stop Serbian attacks on Gorazde before U.N. peacekeeping 
troops reach that city in Bosnia-Herzegovina. But officials suggested that some 
U.N. forces might arrive there soon. 
</P>
<P>
 White House National Security Adviser Anthony Lake outlined the Administration 
position in a rare speech, apparently designed to counter critics' complaints 
that the President's refusal so far to deploy air power has effectively 
encouraged the Bosnian Serbs to continue their siege. 
</P>
<P>
 Lake's remarks largely repeated the Administration's longstanding conditions 
for launching U.S. air strikes -- including the maxim that North Atlantic 
Treaty Organization aircraft would attack only to protect U.N. peacekeeping 
troops who are threatened. 
</P>
<P>
 But officials disclosed that the Administration is pressing British Gen. 
Michael Rose, the U.N. commander in Bosnia, to rush U.N. forces to the city 
quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 Lake said a U.N. contingent "should soon be on its way" to Gorazde. 
</P>
<P>
 Lake also pledged that the Administration will stand by its commitment to send 
U.S. ground troops into Bosnia as part of a U.N. peace-enforcement operation, 
if the three warring factions sign a cease-fire agreement that includes plans 
for a long-term political settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 And he asserted that the United States "has distinct interests at stake" in 
Bosnia to justify "strong American involvement" -- from the need to help 
prevent a widening of the war to stemming a flood of refugees across Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 Key U.S. officials billed Lake's address as the Administration's first attempt 
to prepare the American public for the possibility that the United States might 
send ground troops to Bosnia -- particularly in view of recent signs that a 
peace accord may be imminent. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, that Lake felt compelled to spell out the air-strike policy again 
reflected the Administration's difficulty in defending its limited -- and 
complex -- approach to the Bosnian conflict in the face of the siege of 
Gorazde. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense Secretary William J. Perry set off a barrage of criticism Sunday when 
he said that the Administration would not intervene to stop Gorazde from 
falling to Serbian troops. "We will not enter the war to stop that from 
happening -- that is correct," Perry asserted. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost immediately, State Department officials reportedly took issue with his 
stance, suggesting that Secretary of State Warren Christopher believes that 
military action must be considered. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Perry and Gen. John M. Shalikashvili, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of 
Staff, who echoed the defense secretary's views Wednesday, both had left room 
for air strikes if the situation changed, the Administration again found itself 
described as sharply divided. 
</P>
<P>
 But, ironically, while Lake's speech Thursday attempted to portray the 
Administration position as tough, it merely repeated conditions the White House 
had set previously -- without directly addressing Perry's statements. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let me be clear -- neither the President nor any of his senior advisers rules 
out the use of NATO power to help stop attacks such as those against Gorazde," 
Lake told students at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore. "We stand by that 
commitment," he added later. 
</P>
<P>
 He also asserted that, if the Administration ultimately decides to send ground 
troops to help enforce a peace agreement, it would be "in sufficient mass to 
get the job done." If U.S. forces go into Bosnia, "they will go in strong," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 But at the same time, Lake said U.S. forces would only launch air strikes if 
the sorties were specifically requested by U.N. peacekeeping forces in the area 
and then only as part of a NATO air armada, acting on behalf of the United 
Nations. 
</P>
<P>
 He also warned that, if the United States sends ground troops to enforce a 
peace accord, it will set a specific date for pulling them out, as the 
Administration eventually did in Somalia. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our mission will not be open-ended," he told the students. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration initially said that it had agreed to send about 25,000 U.S. 
troops to Bosnia -- half of a total U.N. force estimated at 50,000 soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
 More recently, however, U.S. officials have said that the United States would 
supply "less than half" of a smaller total force. 
</P>
<P>
 Administration officials have said they imposed the strict conditions on 
deployment of U.S. troops to avoid a protracted war in the Balkans that neither 
Congress nor the American public is likely to support.

MEDICINE; DEATH OF CANADA 'RIGHT TO DIE' ADVOCATE TRIGGERS NEW DEBATE; HER 
LEGAL BATTLE AND PHYSICIAN-ASSISTED END SPUR CHANCES FOR LEGISLATION TO PROTECT 
DOCTORS WHO HELP PERFORM EUTHANASIA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The physician-assisted suicide of Canada's leading advocate of the "right to 
die" has triggered a new national debate on euthanasia and dramatically 
improved chances for legislation that would protect doctors who aid in the 
consensual death of a patient. 
</P>
<P>
 A special committee of the Canadian Senate is scheduled to begin hearings on 
the issue in two weeks, and Prime Minister Jean Chretien has promised a rare 
"free vote" on the question in Parliament, meaning members will be permitted to 
vote their conscience rather than follow an official party position. Opponents, 
including religious organizations and some medical ethicists, plan a 
high-profile counterattack. 
</P>
<P>
 The Canadian Medical Assn. is also struggling with the issue and is expected 
to take a position at its annual meeting in Montreal in August. 
</P>
<P>
 All of this follows the Feb. 12 death of Sue Rodriguez, 43, in her suburban 
Victoria, British Columbia, home. Rodriguez, who was in the latter stages of 
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (Lou Gehrig's disease), died in the arms of a 
member of the Canadian Parliament after being assisted by an as yet 
unidentified doctor. Her death followed a long, well-publicized but 
unsuccessful legal battle for the right to a physician-assisted suicide. 
</P>
<P>
 "She opened the eyes of the Canadian people to the issue of how we die in this 
society and the options available for people with diseases like cancer and 
ALS," said Victoria lawyer Chris Considine, who represented Rodriguez. 
Surveying the chances for a legislative change in the law, Considine added: 
"Sue lost the (legal) battle, but she won the war." 
</P>
<P>
 A national poll taken within weeks of Rodriguez's death showed wide support 
for her cause among the Canadian public, with 74% agreeing that doctors "should 
be legally permitted to assist the death of a terminally ill patient who wants 
to die." 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Fred Lowy, director of the Centre for Bioethics at the University of 
Toronto, suggests that the numbers may be deceiving. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think anybody really knows where this is heading," he said. "There's 
no doubt the public sentiment in this country, and in the U.S. and Britain, is 
hugely in favor. . . . But a lot depends on how you ask the question." 
</P>
<P>
 Euthanasia opponents point to the California experience of 1992, in which 
voters rejected a right-to-die measure despite early favorable polls. 
</P>
<P>
 The question probably will not be submitted to voters here. 
</P>
<P>
 British Columbia member of Parliament Svend Robinson, who became Rodriguez's 
close friend and supporter during her court fight, tearfully described her 
death to reporters two days after it happened. Robinson, Parliament's first 
openly gay member and long identified with controversial causes, has introduced 
a bill in the House of Commons to legalize physician-assisted suicide. 
</P>
<P>
 The more likely starting point for any successful legislation, however, is the 
seven-member Senate committee, chaired by Joan Neiman, a Liberal from Ontario. 
The Senate is an appointed body in Canada and thus less subject to the 
buffeting of politics.  
</P>
<P>
 Neiman said the hearings set for this month will be extensive, and she is 
"quite confident" the Liberal government will use the committee report in 
formulating legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 The most probable scenario for liberalization would be for Canada to follow 
the example of the Netherlands, which has enacted regulations that in effect 
prevent prosecution of doctors who carry out euthanasia. 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson, following Rodriguez's wishes, has refused to identify the doctor who 
aided in her death from an overdose of morphine and secobarbital. 
</P>
<P>
 The Royal Canadian Mounted Police are investigating, but authorities say it is 
unlikely anyone will be charged even if the physician is identified.

POLITICS; GERMAN LEADER PICTURES HIMSELF LIKE CLINTON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARJORIE MILLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It never hurts a German politician to have a picture taken with the President 
of the United States, but for Social Democratic Party leader Rudolf Scharping, 
a shot of his White House meeting with President Clinton next week could prove 
particularly helpful. 
</P>
<P>
 Scharping, who is running hard for Chancellor Helmut Kohl's job, likes to draw 
"certain parallels" between himself and the former governor of Arkansas. 
Scharping is nearly the same age as Clinton and heads the state of 
Rhineland-Palatinate. Like Clinton, he is challenging a party that has been in 
power for 12 years, and he represents change. 
</P>
<P>
 "The mood now is sharply critical -- throw the rascals out," said Thomas 
Kielinger, editor of the Rheinischer Merkur newspaper. "Scharping stands a good 
chance of winning, because people are sick and tired of Kohl." 
</P>
<P>
 Opinion polls give Scharping a considerable advantage over the veteran Kohl 
six months before the Oct. 16 vote. The highest unemployment since World War 
II, huge budget deficits and the high cost of German reunification -- $100 
billion a year -- have soured Kohl's image. 
</P>
<P>
 But the upstart Scharping still has an uphill battle. Germans vote for a 
party, rather than a person, and the left-of-center Social Democrats do not 
score as well in polls as Scharping himself. The party has a bitter history of 
public feuds -- what has been called "a natural inclination to self-destruct." 
</P>
<P>
 The bespectacled Scharping has his own image problems too. He is large and 
serious-looking in horn-rimmed glasses and a neatly trimmed beard, but he is, 
as a fellow party member once said, about "as exciting as a sleeping pill" on 
the stump. 
</P>
<P>
 Scharping was elected the youngest leader ever of his party last summer after 
his predecessor was forced to resign over a political scandal. The 46-year-old 
father of three is a jogging and bicycling enthusiast, freshly tanned from an 
Easter vacation on Majorca, where he went with a cycling buddy. He also is an 
avid fan of soccer -- everyman's game in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 The candidate has been working hard to unite his party and has had some 
success. He has been campaigning to persuade the public and business elite that 
the SPD, as it is called, is politically moderate and ready to govern again. He 
says he is against higher taxes and will reduce public debt. 
</P>
<P>
 Scharping was getting good press on those points until his party presented its 
tax plan last month. While Kohl's center-right Christian Democratic Union plans 
for a 7.5% across-the-board income tax surcharge to pay for reunification, 
Scharping would increase that to 10% for higher-income earners and drop it to 
none on low-income workers. 
</P>
<P>
 But when the Social Democrats suggested that everyone earning 50,000 marks a 
year (about $30,000) or more would be subject to the tax, newspapers such as 
the mass-circulation Bild Zeitung lashed out, claiming that would include 
carpenters, railway workers and child-care providers. When the Christian 
Democrats claimed it would mean higher taxes for more than half of all 
taxpayers, Scharping backed down. 
</P>
<P>
 The Christian Democrats are not likely to go down quietly. Kohl, a shrewd 
warhorse, is banking that Germans have had enough change with reunification and 
want continuity. Kohl's campaign billboards advertise politics "without a 
beard."  
</P>
<P>
 Scharping's trip to Washington, like his trip to Prague last week and to Paris 
last November, is meant to show voters that he has an international profile. He 
will meet with Clinton on Tuesday to talk about economic issues, according to 
Social Democratic spokeswoman Dagmar Wiebusch. 
</P>
<P>
 And for the voters back home, surely he wants his photograph with Clinton. The 
Candidate of Change 
</P>
<P>
 Like President Clinton, Rudolf Scharping represents change in his bid to 
unseat a party that has been in power for 12 years: 
</P>
<P>
 Born Dec. 2, 1947 
</P>
<P>
 Married, father of three 
</P>
<P>
 Member of Social Democratic party since 1966 
</P>
<P>
 Elected to state parliament 1975 
</P>
<P>
 Social Democrat chairman in state of Rhineland-Palatinate since 1985 
</P>
<P>
 Minister President of Rhineland-Palatinate since May 21, 1991

POPE JOHN PAUL ATTENDS FIRST VATICAN CONCERT THAT MEMORIALIZES HOLOCAUST; 
RELIGION: PONTIFF LOOKS ON AS CONCENTRATION CAMP SURVIVORS LIGHT CANDLES. 
AMERICAN LEADS ORCHESTRA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Holy candles burned from a menorah in the heart of the Vatican on Thursday. 
Six candles. One for every 1 million Jews claimed by the Holocaust. 
</P>
<P>
 Pope John Paul II watched the candles. He sat on a tall, white-covered 
armchair flanked on one side by Oscar Luigi Scalfaro, the president of Italy, 
and on the other by Elio Toaff, the chief rabbi of Rome. 
</P>
<P>
 They had come to the great audience hall next to St. Peter's, and 7,500 
spectators with them -- Romans, diplomats, cardinals, concentration camp 
survivors -- for an extraordinary concert marking the anniversary of the Shoah, 
Hebrew for Holocaust. 
</P>
<P>
 When the music ended, John Paul rose to talk about the candles. 
</P>
<P>
 "The candles lit by some of the survivors symbolically show that this hall is 
without limits; it contains all the victims, fathers, mothers, children and 
friends. In this commemoration, all are present. They are with you. They are 
with us," he told the hushed, somberly dressed crowd in the hall where he gives 
his weekly general audience. 
</P>
<P>
 As a young factory hand in his native Poland during World War II, Karol 
Wojtyla witnessed the Nazi persecution of Jews. It marked him. 
</P>
<P>
 The candles, he told concentration camp survivors at a preconcert meeting 
Thursday, "keep before us the long history of anti-Semitism, which culminated 
in the Shoah. But it is not enough that we remember, for in our day, 
regrettably, there are many new manifestations of the anti-Semitism, xenophobia 
and racial hatred which were the seeds of those unspeakable crimes. Humanity 
cannot permit all that to happen again." 
</P>
<P>
 It was the first time that the Vatican officially commemorated the Holocaust. 
</P>
<P>
 The carefully measured performance of London's Royal Philharmonic Orchestra 
under Gilbert Levine, an American Jew, came in the context of perhaps the best 
relations in history between Catholics and Jews. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a marvelous event in Catholic-Jewish relations, but also as a fact of 
history, that the Vatican commemorates the Holocaust. We need facts of history 
to tell future generations about these events and that they were not a figment 
of anybody's imagination," said Levine in an interview before the performance. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1979, a year after his election, John Paul prayed at the infamous Auschwitz 
death camp in Poland. In 1986, he became the first Pope to visit the synagogue 
in Rome, where a Jewish community has lived since before the birth of Christ. 
Last December, he personally oversaw final negotiations to inaugurate 
diplomatic relations between the Holy See and the state of Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is fitting continuation of what I call one of the greatest success 
stories of the 20th Century -- the building of Catholic-Jewish relations. What 
an extraordinary journey to reach this point. There was never a commemoration 
like this," said Rabbi A. James Rudin, inter-religious affairs director of the 
American Jewish Committee who helped plan the concert. 
</P>
<P>
 Each of the six candles was lit by a Holocaust survivor, one of them by 
Levine's mother-in-law, Margit Raab Kalina, originally of Czechoslovakia and 
now of New York. She survived Auschwitz. 
</P>
<P>
 Referring to the survivors in remarks after the concert, John Paul said: 
"Their presence strengthens our common commitment. The evocative melodies which 
we have listened to echo the anguished plea to the Lord, the expression of hope 
in him who hearkens to those who seek him, to welcome and console them. I wish 
to invite all of you to observe a moment of silence, in order to praise the 
Lord with words which he will suggest to our hearts, and to hear once more the 
plea, 'Do not forget us.' " 
</P>
<P>
 There has never been a papal critic of anti-Semitism and racism as outspoken 
as John Paul. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Pope saw the Holocaust, not from any high official level, but on the 
ground in Poland. It was etched into him," Rudin said. 
</P>
<P>
 In his early 20s, the future Pope worked first as a laborer in a stone quarry 
near Krakow, then as a boiler cleaner in a chemical plant during the Nazi 
torment of Jews. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have seen with our own eyes, we were there, and we were witnesses to the 
violence and the hatred which too often ignites in the world and rapidly 
inflames it. We have seen, and we see peace derided, brotherhood betrayed, 
harmony neglected and pity despised," John Paul told the concert audience. 
</P>
<P>
 The program opened with cellist Lynn Harrell and the orchestra playing "Kol 
Nidrei" by composer Max Bruch, a work based on the central prayer of the 
service for Yom Kippur, the Jewish Day of Atonement. Then came the 
contemplative third movement of Ludwig van Beethoven's Ninth Symphony. 
</P>
<P>
 Baritone Howard Nevison and the Choir of St. Peter's Basilica followed with a 
version of the 92nd Psalm written by Franz Shubert, a Catholic, for the 
inauguration of the Vienna synagogue in 1826. 
</P>
<P>
 Actor Richard Dreyfuss, who will host transmission of the concert on U.S. 
public television later this year, narrated the Jewish prayer for the dead from 
Leonard Bernstein's Kaddish symphony. The performance climaxed with Bernstein's 
"Chichester Psalms," also in Hebrew.

YELTSIN FIRES CHEMICAL WARFARE CHIEF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD BOUDREAUX, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Anatoly Kuntsevich, the retired army general assigned to abolish Russia's 
chemical and biological warfare programs but lately accused of working to 
prolong them, was dismissed from his post Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 A one-sentence Kremlin announcement said only that Russian President Boris N. 
Yeltsin fired Kuntsevich for "numerous and gross violations" of his duties as 
chairman of Yeltsin's Committee on Problems of Chemical and Biological 
Disarmament. 
</P>
<P>
 Yeltsin had come under criticism at home and in the West for allowing 
Kuntsevich, a soldier-scientist who once ran the Soviet chemical weapons-making 
complex, to oversee the destruction of his own empire -- tens of thousands of 
tons of poisonous nerve gas and mustard gas stored at seven heavily guarded 
sites across Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 Kuntsevich was in charge of complying with Moscow's 1990 agreement with the 
United States to stop producing such weapons and slash their respective 
arsenals to 5,000 metric tons by the year 2002. His duties expanded last year 
when Russia joined the United States and 155 other nations in signing a treaty 
requiring the destruction of all poison gas by 2005. 
</P>
<P>
 But last month, Valery Menshikov, a consultant to Yeltsin's National Security 
Council, raised questions about the retired general's credibility. Menshikov 
said Kuntsevich had understated the weapons stockpile, officially reported as 
40,000 metric tons. Unofficial estimates in Moscow put the stockpile at 70,000 
metric tons. 
</P>
<P>
 Russian scientists have accused the military of mishandling the stockpile, 
exposing millions of people to poisons as a result of testing, leakage or 
improper dumping in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite $55 million in U.S. aid commitments, the Russian disarmament effort 
has been stalled by inefficiency, grass-roots resistance to building of weapons 
destruction facilities and the nation's economic woes. While the United States 
has begun destroying its arsenal of 30,000 metric tons, Russia has delayed its 
first steps until 1997. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Russian program has gone nowhere," Amy E. Smithson, a chemical weapons 
specialist at the Henry L. Stimson Center in Washington, said in a telephone 
interview. "There is no plan. Everything has been done with false starts. 
Officials seem to be more interested in lining their own pockets than getting 
the job done." 
</P>
<P>
 The immediate reason for Kuntsevich's dismissal was unclear. But it came 
shortly after he lost a celebrated legal and political battle with one of his 
chief critics, a Russian chemist named Vil S. Mirzayanov. 
</P>
<P>
 Mirzayanov announced in October, 1992, that Russia was testing a new 
generation of chemical weapons after having signed agreements banning them. He 
said he helped develop a new nerve toxin until his conscience made him stop. 
</P>
<P>
 The chemist was arrested and put on trial for disclosing state secrets, with 
Kuntsevich as a chief accuser. Amid an outcry of protest from human rights 
groups and foreign governments, including the Clinton Administration, the 
charges against him were dropped a month ago. 
</P>
<P>
 He continues to insist that Russia is developing new chemical weapons, despite 
Yeltsin's repeated assurances to Western leaders that such research has been 
halted. 
</P>
<P>
 London's Sunday Times echoed the chemist's assertion last month, saying three 
Russian defectors to the West had reported steps by the military, behind 
Yeltsin's back, to develop biological weapons of mass destruction, including a 
"super-plague powder" for which the West has no antidote. The newspaper said 
the powder was so powerful that 440 pounds sprayed from an aircraft could kill 
up to 500,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Russia's Defense Ministry promptly denied the report, weapons 
specialists in Moscow and Washington said it may have focused Yeltsin's 
attention on the controversial Kuntsevich. 
</P>
<P>
 "Russian officials need to recognize how their lackluster performance in 
planning a chemical weapons destruction program and how these charges -- placed 
in the context of the Soviet compliance record -- look from the outside," 
Smithson said in an address last week at the Center for Strategic and 
International Studies in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Mirzayanov, the whistle-blowing chemist, said he hopes that the Kremlin 
announcement means that "the president has finally listened to our criticism." 
</P>
<P>
 Yeltsin's announcement named no successor.

LEGAL OPINION COULD SNARL PRESIDENT'S COURT CHOICES; NOMINATION: SOME SAY 
REAGAN-ERA JUSTICE DEPARTMENT PAPER ON APPOINTMENT OF LAWMAKERS WOULD BAR 
MITCHELL. WHITE HOUSE OFFICIALS DISAGREE.

 A Justice Department legal opinion issued during the Ronald Reagan 
Administration could complicate President Clinton's consideration of Senate 
Majority Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.) as a nominee to replace retiring 
Supreme Court Justice Harry A. Blackmun. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1987 opinion, which was never disclosed publicly, is based on a 
constitutional provision that bars the appointment of a U.S. senator or 
representative to any federal office if the salary for the vacant position was 
increased while the candidate served in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources familiar with the opinion said it concluded that the constitutional 
prohibition cannot be waived by simply lowering the salary for a post back to 
its previous level in order that the lawmaker can be named to the position. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it would be unconstitutional" said Charles J. Cooper, who headed the 
Office of Legal Counsel in the Justice Department when the opinion was written. 
The office serves as the attorney general's legal adviser and does legal 
analysis for the President. 
</P>
<P>
 The salary of Supreme Court justices was last increased in 1991, rising to 
$148,300 from $118,600 before cost-of-living raises and other adjustments, 
which pushed the pay to $164,100 by 1993. Mitchell has served in the Senate 
since 1980. 
</P>
<P>
 The opinion was drafted seven years ago for Reagan, who was considering 
nominating Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) to the Supreme Court vacancy that 
eventually was filled by Justice Anthony M. Kennedy.  
</P>
<P>
 Cooper, in an interview, declined to confirm the existence of the opinion, 
noting that he cannot discuss any legal advice he provided to the President. 
But other sources familiar with the opinion said Cooper was the author, and 
they described its reasoning. 
</P>
<P>
 While Cooper would not discuss any opinions issued by his office, he said: "I 
can tell you what my view is now, and my research has not discovered anything 
in intervening years that is different." 
</P>
<P>
 Cooper said he rejects the "Saxbe fix" used by the Senate and then-President 
Richard Nixon in naming Sen. William Saxbe (R-Ohio) to succeed Atty. Gen. 
Elliot L. Richardson, who resigned rather then fire special prosecutor 
Archibald Cox during the Watergate scandal. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the Saxbe arrangement, the salary of attorney general was reduced to the 
level where it stood when Saxbe began his Senate term. The same arrangement was 
repeated last year to pave the way for the confirmation of former Sen. Lloyd 
Bentsen (D-Tex.) as secretary of the Treasury. 
</P>
<P>
 "You cannot appoint a sitting legislator to a position whose emoluments have 
been increased -- period," Cooper said. "Evasions and maneuvers are just that. 
They're not in keeping with the Constitution." 
</P>
<P>
 White House Special Counsel Lloyd N. Cutler said Thursday that he knew about 
the 1987 opinion but disagrees with its conclusion. In addition, he said he was 
aware of a contrary opinion issued by one of Cooper's predecessors in the Jimmy 
Carter Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 Justice Department spokesman Carl Stern said the White House has not asked the 
current Office of Legal Counsel to review the matter, but he added that he 
could not rule out such a request in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 Cooper said that filling a Supreme Court post presents more constitutional 
obstacles than does a Cabinet appointment. He cited Article III, Section 1, of 
the Constitution, which provides that the pay of all federal judges, including 
Supreme Court justices, "shall not be diminished during their continuance in 
office." 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, Blackmun would have to step down before the salary was reduced, and 
Mitchell could not be sworn in as his successor until the pay cut took effect, 
Cooper said. "That is not the norm," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, Cooper said, "a two-tier salary for the Supreme Court would cause 
confusion -- unless you made the evasion transparent by immediately increasing 
the salary" once Mitchell took his seat. 
</P>
<P>
 Although critics might accuse Clinton of manipulating the Constitution by 
finding a way around the pay-raise problem, some prominent conservatives see 
the issue otherwise: Former Acting Atty. Gen. Robert H. Bork, whose subsequent 
nomination to the high court was derailed by political opponents, once endorsed 
the "Saxbe fix" in 1973 Senate testimony. 
</P>
<P>
 But Daniel Troy, who was an attorney in the Office of Legal Counsel in 1987 
and regards Bork as "the great god of strict constructionism" in reading the 
Constitution, said he thinks Bork was "just wrong."

CLINTON STRONGLY WEIGHING POLITICIAN FOR COURT CHOICE; JUDICIARY: SELECTION OF 
MITCHELL WOULD MARK A BREAK WITH RECENT PRECEDENT. HIS EXPERIENCE IN DEALING 
WITH SOCIAL ISSUES IS SEEN AS A BIG PLUS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 President Clinton may be about to break with recent precedent and return to an 
older, more established precedent. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the 1950s, a President typically chose for the Supreme Court a 
prominent politician, a high government official or a nationally known 
attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, the high court of 40 years ago was led by a former California 
governor, and included three former U.S. senators; two former U.S. attorneys 
general, one of whom had been the chief prosecutor at the Nuremberg war crimes 
trial; a U.S. solicitor general and a former chairman of the Securities and 
Exchange Commission.  
</P>
<P>
 At the time, the only justice who had not won election or held a high 
government post was Felix Frankfurter, a Harvard law professor who had helped 
found the American Civil Liberties Union and had gained a national reputation 
when he defended anarchists Sacco and Vanzetti. 
</P>
<P>
 By comparison, the Supreme Court nominees of recent years have been unknown to 
most Americans. Seven of the nine current justices were judges on U.S. appeals 
courts. One came to Washington from a state appeals court. And one held a 
mid-level Justice Department job. 
</P>
<P>
 Only one of the current justices has ever won an election: Sandra Day O'Connor 
is a former Arizona state senator. Only one has ever held a top post in the 
U.S. government: Clarence Thomas once served as chairman of the Equal 
Employment Opportunity Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 But Clinton is strongly considering filling the seat being vacated by retiring 
Justice Harry A. Blackmun with a consummate legislator and politician: Senate 
Majority Leader George J. Mitchell, a Maine Democrat who has also served as a 
federal prosecutor and a federal trial judge in Portland. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell's broad background in politics and law has made him exceedingly 
attractive for the nomination in the eyes of White House advisers and some 
court watchers. 
</P>
<P>
 "He would bring a unique combination of legal and real-world experience to the 
court," said Elliot Mincberg, legal director for People for the American Way. 
Those qualities, Mincberg said, are in relatively short supply on the current 
court. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's a great idea," said American University law professor Hermann 
Schwartz. "Those who come from the bench or academia tend to have a narrow, 
isolated view of the law. The Supreme Court has to confront the big social and 
human issues and it's better to have someone who has been bruised up a bit in 
the hurly-burly world of politics, someone who has seen the law at work in 
society." 
</P>
<P>
 Some court observers think otherwise, fearing that the appointment of a 
politician to the court could tarnish its standing. Many Americans, they 
believe, have come to expect that politicians and justices will be kept 
separate. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it could cast some suspicion on the legitimacy and neutrality of the 
court," said Bruce Fein, a conservative legal analyst. "It could also give an 
appearance of political packing if the justice, as a senator, has already 
staked out political positions." 
</P>
<P>
 Fein questioned whether politicians, by temperament, are suited for the court. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to have some enthusiasm for the life of the scholar -- reading, 
thinking and writing," Fein said. "If you have a short attention span and your 
strength is massaging the egos of other politicians, then you are not going to 
be a constructive justice." 
</P>
<P>
 For their part, White House officials sought to dampen speculation that 
Mitchell is the sure nominee. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's unfair to Sen. Mitchell and everyone else to say this is a one-person 
decision," said presidential adviser Bruce Lindsey. He told reporters that as 
many as 10 to 12 people are being considered, although he acknowledged that 
Mitchell is the front-runner. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the politicians who have joined the high court have become true stars, 
while nearly as many have become dismal failures. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles Evans Hughes, chief justice during the 1930s, had served earlier as 
New York's governor and U.S. secretary of state. He ran as the Republican 
candidate for President in 1916. When chosen to lead the Supreme Court in 1930, 
he replaced another highly successful chief justice, William Howard Taft, the 
only former President to serve on the high court. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1937, President Franklin D. Roosevelt ran into sharp criticism over his 
first court appointee: Sen. Hugo Black of Alabama. Known as a populist and 
highly partisan New Dealer, Black was soon forced to admit that he once had 
been a member of the Ku Klux Klan. 
</P>
<P>
 But, confounding expectations, Black proved to be a devoted and principled 
jurist who spent countless evenings reading constitutional history in the 
Library of Congress. A champion of free speech and the Bill of Rights, he 
established himself as a true leader of the court during his 34-year career. 
</P>
<P>
 President Harry S. Truman turned to political friends when Supreme Court seats 
came vacant, but with disappointing results. 
</P>
<P>
 As a freshman senator from Missouri, Truman had sat next to a freshman from 
Indiana, the congenial, tobacco-chewing Sen. Sherman Minton. In 1949, Truman 
called his friend "Shay" and offered him a seat on the Supreme Court. 
Unfortunately, Minton accepted. 
</P>
<P>
 "His seven-year stint on the court has been universally and justly regarded as 
a failure," wrote historian Henry J. Abraham in his book, "Justices and 
Presidents." Though a pleasant man and a good politician, Minton was "devoid of 
judicial powers," he said. Apparently, even Minton agreed, noting in his 1956 
resignation letter that there will not be much "interest in my passing. I'm an 
echo." 
</P>
<P>
 The last prominent politician to go to the high court was California Gov. Earl 
Warren in 1953. A bold, if controversial, chief justice, Warren led the court 
in making sweeping changes, beginning with the 1954 Brown vs. Board of 
Education ruling that overturned a century of racial segregation. 
</P>
<P>
 Warren had the "broad vision and self confidence to shake up the system," said 
Georgetown law professor Louis M. Seidman. 
</P>
<P>
 But conservatives are wary for much the same reason, arguing that politicians 
often do not see a clear line between law and politics. They point to President 
Dwight D. Eisenhower's own reflection in calling the Warren appointment "the 
biggest damn fool mistake I ever made."

CLINTON CHALLENGED ON COST OF HEALTH CARE TO EMPLOYERS; REFORM: PIZZA CHAIN 
CHIEF TELLS THE PRESIDENT HIS CALCULATIONS ARE OFF, THAT A MANDATE TO PROVIDE 
INSURANCE FOR ALL WORKERS WILL COST JOBS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Call it the confrontation of the President and the pizza man. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton traveled here Thursday for another in his series of 
televised town hall meetings designed to drum up support for his health care 
program. But in the midst of a generally polite and respectful set of 
questions, up popped Herman Cain, the chief executive of the national 
Godfather's Pizza chain, who took on Clinton over the most sensitive point in 
the health care debate -- costs. 
</P>
<P>
 "For many, many businesses, like mine, the cost of your plan is simply a cost 
that will cause us to eliminate jobs," Cain said. "If I'm forced to do this, 
what will I tell those people whose jobs I will be forced to eliminate?" 
</P>
<P>
 Cain is a prominent member of several business groups that have campaigned 
actively against Clinton's plan and has appeared in several advertisements 
opposing it. And the issue he raised is one of considerable importance in the 
congressional debate over health care because of the political potency of the 
small-business lobby and of the restaurant industry, both of which strongly 
oppose mandatory health benefits, and because of the more widespread public 
worry that the cost of Clinton's plan would lead some businesses to eliminate 
jobs.  
</P>
<P>
 Godfather's has about 10,000 workers but they are spread out among more than 
500 franchise restaurants nationwide. Only about one-third of the company's 
employees receive insurance, Cain said. A requirement that the company insure 
all its workers -- the central requirement in Clinton's plan -- would boost 
costs enough to wipe out the company's entire annual profit, Cain insisted. 
</P>
<P>
 As the rest of the audience, spread among television studios in four 
Midwestern cities, watched, Cain and Clinton engaged in a complex argument over 
insurance costs -- precisely the sort of debate over numbers that has made the 
Washington debate over the issue so complicated. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton insisted that the way his plan is structured, any company's cost for 
insuring its workers would be capped at 7.9% of payroll. Because payroll costs 
are only about one-third of Godfather's total costs, Clinton said, the 
requirement would add at most a little over 2% to the company's total expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if Godfather's and its competitors all had to raise prices 2%, Americans 
would still buy pizza, Clinton said, adding, "I'm a satisfied customer."  
</P>
<P>
 Cain, however, insisted Clinton's calculations were wrong. The plan would 
cause as much as a 16% increase in his costs, he claimed, leading a frustrated 
President to finally ask him to "send to me personally your calculations." 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't get there," Clinton insisted. 
</P>
<P>
 White House officials said they could not specifically rebut Cain's argument 
because they had not seen the company's figures. But they do concede that 
restaurants, which generally do not provide insurance and which employ large 
numbers of low-income and part-time workers, make up the industry that likely 
would be hit hardest by a requirement that all companies provide insurance to 
workers. 
</P>
<P>
 The debate with Cain was the exception to a generally polite -- almost demure 
-- discussion. 
</P>
<P>
 That friendly tone was a sharp contrast to a town hall two days ago in which 
Clinton was hit with several harshly worded questions on issues such as the 
Whitewater affair. Unlike that session, this one was explicitly limited to 
questions regarding health care reform. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier in the day, Clinton visited Topeka, Kan., for a health care forum with 
owners of small businesses whose Washington lobbyists have become the most 
powerful critics of his health plan. 
</P>
<P>
 The forum broke no new ground, but clearly illustrated one of the most 
important contradictions in public attitudes about reforming health care. 
Virtually all members of the audience raised their hands when the area's 
congressman, Jim Slattery, asked how many believed that all people should have 
health insurance and should contribute to it. But only three raised their hands 
when Slattery asked how many thought that coverage should be mandated. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we don't require it," Slattery asked, "how can achieve the goal?" That is 
the main issue Congress is grappling with, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Slattery's presence was the chief, indeed almost the only, reason why Clinton 
traveled to Topeka, in the midst of one of the most Republican states in the 
country. The conservative Democrat holds a key vote on the House Energy and 
Commerce Committee, which is one of the two House panels that will consider the 
bulk of Clinton's plan. 
</P>
<P>
 From Kansas, Clinton flew on to Minneapolis where he plans to host another 
town hall tonight.

 President Clinton slipped and fell in mud during his regular morning jog 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The President, who was almost two miles into a three-mile run, slipped and 
fell on a muddy incline near the Tidal Basin in northwest Washington and soiled 
his long-sleeved white T-shirt, turquoise shorts and left leg. 
</P>
<P>
 "He slipped and fell and got right back up," said a woman who ran with 
Clinton. "He got right back up and ran even faster." 
</P>
<P>
 The President and members of a national running club ran three miles in just 
under 30 minutes on slippery conditions caused by a recent rainfall. 
</P>
<P>
 A free-lance photographer in the White House press corps who was taking 
pictures of the runners slipped and fell near the same area.

HUFFINGTON ATTACKS FEINSTEIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Santa Barbara Rep. Michael Huffington, a Republican candidate for U.S. Senate, 
launched a pair of commercials this week that attack Democratic incumbent 
Dianne Feinstein as being a big spender for supporting President Clinton's 
budget last year. The campaign did not disclose how much it paid for the ads, 
which are scheduled to air statewide for two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 * THE ADS: One commercial charges that the 1993 budget's tax increases have 
hurt California's economy. "By a single vote, the Senate passed the biggest tax 
increase in American history -- that single vote is Dianne Feinstein's," the ad 
says. "Feinstein votes for the tax increase even though it hurts people on 
Social Security and small business. It costs Californians $27 billion." The 
second commercial seeks to contrast Huffington and Feinstein on fiscal issues. 
"Citizens Against Government Waste calls Huffington 'heroic.' The National 
Taxpayers Union ranks Feinstein the eighth-biggest spender -- ahead of even Ted 
Kennedy and Barbara Boxer." 
</P>
<P>
 * THE ANALYSIS: Huffington's campaign has two hopes for these ads -- that they 
will raise his still-obscure profile and check the popularity for Feinstein 
reflected in recent polls. Feinstein was listed eighth by the National 
Taxpayers Union, but the group acknowledges that its criteria could penalize 
prolific legislators. NTU says the government's cost for 31 bills co-sponsored 
by Feinstein last year was $42 billion, most due to her support for Clinton's 
failed jobs stimulus bill and his still-pending health care plan. Huffington, 
meanwhile, co-sponsored four spending bills last year that would save the 
government $19 billion. Still, he was the seventh-highest spender of 
California's 22 Republican House members. The commercial's reference to 
California's $27-billion cost for the 1993 budget is based on a study by the 
Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank. Also, the 1993 tax package, one 
of the largest in history, targeted gas, wealthy households, businesses and 
upper-income Social Security recipients.

JUDGE REJECTS WARRANTLESS POLICE SEARCHES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Police can't conduct warrantless gun searches in public housing projects, a 
federal judge said Thursday in a decision that rebuffed pleas from housing 
officials and tenants who hoped the sweeps would quell gang violence. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. District Judge Wayne Andersen's ruling ended the latest round in an 
emotional dispute between city officials and civil libertarians who argue that 
the courts can't grant a wholesale waiver of the Constitution's protection 
against unreasonable searches. 
</P>
<P>
 "The erosion of the rights of people on the other side of town will ultimately 
undermine the rights of each of us," Andersen said in refusing to lift a ban he 
imposed last month. 
</P>
<P>
 Violence last summer prompted the Chicago Housing Authority to ask police to 
conduct the random, door-to-door searches for weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton said after the ruling he has ordered Atty. Gen. Janet Reno 
and Housing Secretary Henry G. Cisneros to develop a search policy for all U.S. 
public housing that is constitutionally permissible. 
</P>
<P>
 "We must not allow criminals to find shelter in the public housing community 
they terrorize," Clinton said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
 Some tenants also backed the warrantless searches, saying they would prefer 
the sweeps to random gunfire that made it dangerous to stand near windows or 
venture outside. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mothers put kids in their bathtubs in fear of their lives," CHA chairman 
Vincent Lane said before the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 Lane left the courtroom without comment after Andersen's ruling. Earlier, he 
had said he didn't expect Andersen to lift the ban and predicted the case would 
wind up in the Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
 The American Civil Liberties Union sued to halt the searches on behalf of 
Chicago's estimated 150,000 public housing tenants. 
</P>
<P>
 Gang warfare last month in the huge Robert Taylor Homes project brought new 
urgency to the debate. Police received more than 300 reports of gunfire in the 
28-building, 12,320-tenant complex over a five-day period. 
</P>
<P>
 Andersen has permitted police to conduct warrantless searches if specific 
apartments are pinpointed as sources of gunfire, and Lane promised to use that 
authority if violence erupts again in the projects.

FDA OBJECTS TO 19-YEAR DELAY IN RELEASE OF IMPLANT STUDY; HEALTH: DOW CORNING 
FAILED TO TELL AGENCY OF RESEARCH INTO ADVERSE EFFECT ON MICE OF COMPOUND IN 
SILICONE GEL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HENRY WEINSTEIN, TIMES LEGAL AFFAIRS WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The head of the federal Food and Drug Administration on Thursday expressed 
serious concerns about Dow Corning Corp.'s 19-year-delay in disclosing a study 
indicating that a component of the silicone gel in breast implants harmed the 
immune system of mice. 
</P>
<P>
 "The agency has significant concerns both about the findings and the manner in 
which they became available to us," FDA Commissioner David Kessler said. 
</P>
<P>
 The FDA first obtained the study last week from lawyers representing women 
suing Dow Corning and other companies, alleging that they were injured by 
silicone gel breast implants. 
</P>
<P>
 "The report seems to suggest that one of the compounds that is present in 
breast implants and that we were concerned about does have adverse impacts," 
Kessler said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
 FDA spokesman James O'Hara said Kessler was referring to the fact that Dow 
failed to provide the study during 1991 and 1992 FDA hearings on implant 
safety. At those hearings, O'Hara said, "there was considerable discussion 
about the significance" of the material Dow studied in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert LeVier, Dow Corning's director of bioscience research, one of the 
co-authors of the 1975 study, participated in the FDA hearings in 1991. At the 
time of the hearings, LeVier said that the company had not seen any 
"immunologic events" from the material, which is called D4. 
</P>
<P>
 LeVier made a brief reference to the 1975 study in a March, 1993, letter to 
the FDA, a year after the agency had restricted the use of implants. But the 
company did not provide the study at the time, according to FDA officials. 
</P>
<P>
 The controversy over the new study arose as thousands of women around the 
country are trying to decide whether to join a pending $3.75-billion settlement 
of implant cases that could bring individual women awards ranging from $105,000 
to $1.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Anderson, Dow Corning executive vice president, contended that the study 
revealed no significant hazard and had not been disclosed because of that. He 
also expressed concern that publicity about the study might cause women to opt 
out of the settlement, believing that they could fare better in court because 
their lawyers could argue that Dow suppressed evidence of safety hazards. 
</P>
<P>
 Several plaintiffs' lawyers said they did not think the 1975 study alone would 
prompt a woman to choose not to join the settlement. "I think very few 
decisions will be made on the basis of this study," said Ernie Hornsby, a 
Dothan, Ala., lawyer who represents several hundred women in implant cases. 
However, Hornsby and other attorneys said the study could be quite useful to a 
woman who decided to take her case to court because it might help her win 
punitive damages. 
</P>
<P>
 The attorneys who gave the study to the FDA said they found it last month 
while reviewing millions of documents turned over to them by court order last 
May. 
</P>
<P>
 "The overall significance of the study" is that it belies contentions "by the 
implant manufacturers, primarily Dow, that there is no immune response elicited 
by a silicone gel breast implant," Hornsby said. "This study shows there was an 
immune response and they were aware of it in 1975. The D4 material in the 
implant had a suppressive effect on the immune system of the mice. While the 
study is not conclusive, it put Dow on notice" of possible dangers, Hornsby 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the study is shocking," said Frederic L. Ellis, a Boston lawyer who 
represents numerous women suing Dow and who came upon the study last month. 
"It's unconscionable that Dow knew this material, called D4, could stimulate 
the immune system and they didn't tell the FDA, plastic surgeons or the women, 
and they kept implants on the market." 
</P>
<P>
 But Anderson, Dow's executive vice president, said the plaintiffs' lawyers had 
mischaracterized the significance of the study. 
</P>
<P>
 "Had we seen a negative health effect . . . we would have submitted the report 
to the FDA and probably have withdrawn the product from the market," Anderson 
said. "The results indicated there was no need to be concerned, so we didn't 
submit the report." 
</P>
<P>
 Barbara S. Carmichael, Dow's chief spokeswoman, offered a more detailed 
explanation. 
</P>
<P>
 "When this material was tested in its pure form at an extremely high dose 
level, it showed no effect on the immune system of mice," Carmichael said. She 
said that only when the D4 material was mixed with a foreign substance that 
does not appear in implants did it show "a marginal and short-lived (48-hour) 
effect on the immune system of the mice." 
</P>
<P>
 Ellis said that plaintiffs also had discovered references to other Dow studies 
dating to 1971 during the discovery process and that the company had failed to 
turn over these documents. 
</P>
<P>
 This week, Ellis and other plaintiffs lawyers filed papers with U.S. District 
Judge Sam C. Pointer Jr. in Birmingham, Ala., who is presiding over 6,000 
implant lawsuits, requesting that he compel Dow to turn over the other studies. 
Ellis said he believed the judge would rule on the motion this month. 
</P>
<P>
 There has been considerable debate in the scientific community on whether 
breast implants have a negative impact on the immune system or cause other 
medical problems, such as tissue problems, aching joints and short-term memory 
loss. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, at least two knowledgeable researchers differed on the study's 
significance. 
</P>
<P>
 "The results from the 1975 study seriously challenge statements that silicone 
is inert," said Dr. Nir Kossovsky, associate professor of pathology at UCLA, 
who has done considerable research on women with implants and testified for 
plaintiffs in implant lawsuits. That is significant because women contend they 
have been injured by silicone leaking out of the implant pouch and migrating 
throughout their systems. 
</P>
<P>
 Kossovsky also said the study shows that silicone can account for numerous 
symptoms described by implant recipients, including fevers, joint aches, chills 
and general malaise. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, John Naim, an immunologist at Rochester, N.Y., General 
Hospital, said he concurred with Dow's position on the study. "At the time, 
from their point of view, it was not relevant." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, negotiations continued between 3M and other breast implant 
manufacturers who thus far have not joined the settlement. If 3M and the other 
companies join the settlement, it could add up to $1 billion to the fund.

BROWN BACKS ROBERTI ON FIREARMS BILL; POLITICS: STATE SENATOR, WHO FACES A 
RECALL, ENLISTS THE GUBERNATORIAL CANDIDATE AS 'CO-SPONSOR' OF A MEASURE TO 
CLOSE LOOPHOLES IN THE BAN ON MILITARY-STYLE ASSAULT WEAPONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 With only days remaining before his recall election, state Sen. David A. 
Roberti escalated his campaign Thursday by enlisting Treasurer Kathleen Brown's 
support for a new bill to patch loopholes in his 5-year-old assault weapons 
ban. 
</P>
<P>
 Calling the legislation "a top priority of my comprehensive crime package," 
Brown challenged Gov. Pete Wilson and others to line up behind the bill. 
</P>
<P>
 If passed, the legislation will broaden the scope of Roberti's 1989 Assault 
Weapon Control Act by adding a generic description of military-style 
semiautomatic weapons to the law, which currently lists banned firearms by 
name. 
</P>
<P>
 Gun manufacturers have been getting around the law by making identical weapons 
under different names from those identified under the ban. They also skirt the 
ban by making slight changes in new models of forbidden guns. 
</P>
<P>
 Under sunny skies at a rural Sacramento firing range, Roberti introduced Brown 
as "a spokesperson and co-sponsor" of his legislation. Joined by San Francisco 
Dist. Atty. Arlo Smith, the politicians stood by as Senate Sgt. at Arms Tony 
Beard shot up watermelons in an effort to demonstrate the firepower of 
so-called copycat assault weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know what it takes to pass gun control legislation," Roberti said. "The gun 
lobby can beat the public with all kinds of political intimidation behind 
closed doors. . . . That's why we need someone as public on our side as a 
candidate for governor." 
</P>
<P>
 In recent weeks nothing, it seems, has raised the profile of the gun control 
debate like Roberti's recall election in his San Fernando Valley district, with 
the national media portraying him as a David to the firearms lobby's Goliath. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberti's campaign has fueled that image, getting support from such prominent 
figures as former White House press secretary James Brady, who was wounded in 
an assassination attempt on former President Ronald Reagan; his wife, Sarah 
Brady, who heads Handgun Control Inc.; actor Beau Bridges, who played Brady in 
a TV movie, and survivors who lost family members in assault weapon violence. 
</P>
<P>
 Although recall proponents confirm that Roberti's 1989 assault weapon ban 
spurred a movement against him, they say he is using the issue as a smoke 
screen to hide from charges of carpetbagging, political corruption and 
liberalism. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked why he waited until just days before his election to introduce his 
fix-it bill, Roberti blamed the timing on distractions created by the recall 
drive. 
</P>
<P>
 "This highlights the problem of the recall. It interrupts your term and the 
work you do," the Van Nuys Democrat said, noting that he and Brown had been 
negotiating a bill for two months. 
</P>
<P>
 Until December, Roberti said, he felt his 1989 law was sufficient to control 
military-style semiautomatic weapons in California as long as state officials 
could continue to add more firearms to the banned list.  
</P>
<P>
 In fact, when he first introduced the bill five years ago, it had contained a 
generic description of military-style semiautomatic weapons that he later had 
to drop to get enough votes to pass the initial legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, last December, a gun manufacturer obtained another in a series of court 
injunctions against the law that allows state officials to go after copycat 
weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was the straw that broke the camel's back," Roberti said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson's office said he has not yet seen the bill, which is tentatively 
scheduled to be assigned to a senate committee next week for its first public 
hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't speak to Ms. Brown's comments, but I do know the governor has a very 
good record in this area," said Wilson spokesman Sean Walsh, noting that the 
governor signed the 1989 assault weapon ban. 
</P>
<P>
 Darry Sragow, gubernatorial campaign manager for Insurance Commissioner John 
Garamendi, said Garamendi supports the law, but added: "This is another example 
of Kathleen Brown trying to cover herself by adopting somebody else's proposal. 
And she's not even a member of the Legislature." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, in the Valley, the 20th Senate District Republican Central 
Committee announced its endorsement of GOP candidate Dolores White, one of 
Roberti's five opponents in the recall. White, 59, is a real estate broker who 
ran against Roberti in 1992.

INSPECTIONS OF STEEL-FRAME BUILDINGS URGED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SONIA NAZARIO and KENNETH REICH, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As the toll of earthquake damage to steel-frame buildings mounts, the state 
has issued an unprecedented advisory urging owners of buildings that suffered 
cosmetic damage to conduct thorough inspections to check for cracks in 
supporting columns. 
</P>
<P>
 Steel-frame office buildings have long been considered invulnerable to 
collapse, but the California Seismic Safety Commission issued its advisory this 
week because engineers have uncovered widespread evidence that steel beams and 
welds cracked in the Jan. 17 Northridge quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles city officials said that cracking has been found in the steel 
frames of at least 50 buildings, constituting at least 10% of the low- to 
mid-rise structures built in the area since 1970. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the failures occurred in mid-rise buildings of less than 10 stories, 
but an 18-story twin tower in Warner Center and an unidentified 23-story 
high-rise elsewhere in the San Fernando Valley also had structural problems. 
</P>
<P>
 The failures already have prompted city officials to require more rigorous 
welding procedures in new steel-frame buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Orange County did not suffer much damage in the quake, the Sony 
Jumbotron at Anaheim Stadium collapsed because the two main steel support beams 
were thinner than designers specified, an engineer said. As a result, the city 
reinforced steel beams throughout the stadium to bring them up to current 
earthquake standards. 
</P>
<P>
 In January, the state Seismic Safety Commission said that 57 structures in 
Orange County and three of its cities missed a state deadline for coming up 
with plans to reduce the risk to unreinforced buildings in an earthquake. The 
governments said they had either complied with the law or were scrambing to 
comply. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, officials said they plan to announce within two weeks that owners 
of all steel-frame buildings near the quake's epicenter will be required to 
conduct inspections for hidden structural damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Holguin, assistant chief of the building bureau of the city's Building 
and Safety Department, said officials are also considering whether to require 
citywide inspections of such buildings, which made up half of all buildings 
constructed last year in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the mounting damage tally has sparked concerns about the safety of 
the cloud-piercing towers in Downtown, Century City and elsewhere, even though 
engineers emphasize that no steel-frame buildings came close to collapsing 
during the temblor. 
</P>
<P>
 "The world is watching," said L. Tom Tobin, executive director of the 
California Seismic Commission. "There is no question that this has been a 
wake-up call for the engineering and construction community world wide." 
</P>
<P>
 Steel-frame buildings, designed to bend with the enormous forces of an 
earthquake without breaking, have been considered among the safest to ride out 
an earthquake. But the commission noted: "Damage was reported to a significant 
number of steel structures shaken by the Northridge earthquake, raising 
concerns about the extent and implications of this damage." 
</P>
<P>
 The advisory issued Wednesday said damage to some types of steel buildings has 
never before been observed. "This is a new concern that can be serious, but 
should not be exaggerated," the commission said. 
</P>
<P>
 Noting that "damage can weaken a building's ability to resist future 
earthquakes," the commission urged building owners who observed damage to 
contact architects or engineers to investigate. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials fear that because steel columns are covered by walls and thick 
fireproofing material, damage is not readily apparent to building owners or 
even to engineers, and that the number with cracked frames may escalate 
further. By late February, only a dozen buildings with steel-frame damage had 
been reported. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, about 90% of the steel-frame buildings where cracks have been reported 
to the city are in the Valley; most of the others are on the Westside. All are 
believed to have been built in the last decade. 
</P>
<P>
 Failures among these relatively new structures may have been the result of a 
different welding method used in recent years, said Los Angeles structural 
engineer Nabih Youssef, who is the head of a city blue-ribbon panel on seismic 
hazards. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten percent of the joints in the Warner Center's 18-story twin towers cracked; 
other buildings had breaks in up to 90% of the welds that hold vertical columns 
and horizontal beams, Holguin said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Building owners should take this seriously," he added. "There is a concern 
that buildings out there that don't appear to have damage do." 
</P>
<P>
 Steel industry officials emphasized that steel buildings are safe. "These 
structures found a way to survive despite these problems," said Nestor Iwankiw, 
director of research at the American Institute of Steel Construction. 
</P>
<P>
 Ray Remy, president of the Los Angeles Area Chamber of Commerce, said: "I 
think any property owner, particularly one hit hard by the earthquake, is well 
advised to follow the advice of the committee." 
</P>
<P>
 Remy said that having buildings inspected now improves chances that at least 
some of the costs will be defrayed by government programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Engineers have suggested that low-quality steel, badly designed beam-to-column 
connections or poorly executed welds could have led to the cracks. About a 
dozen of the 50 buildings required temporary or partial evacuations for 
repairs; the remainder are being fixed on weekends, Youssef said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, at the annual meeting of the Seismological Society of America in 
Pasadena, one expert estimated that some steel-frame buildings would collapse 
if a magnitude 7 earthquake struck directly underneath Downtown Los Angeles, 
which is a remote possibility. 
</P>
<P>
 John F. Hall, associate professor of civil engineering at Caltech, estimated 
that such a quake on the deeply buried Elysian Park thrust fault would collapse 
two 20-story steel-frame buildings, 30 four- to eight-story buildings and 150 
smaller ones. 
</P>
<P>
 Hall and Robert Englekirk, chief executive officer of the structural 
engineering firm of Englekirk & Sabol in Irvine, cautioned that more study is 
needed before any precise upgrades can be prescribed for existing steel-frame 
buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 Englekirk noted that the steel industry is financing an unprecedented 
four-month study at the University of Texas to help determine what caused the 
cracks. Caltech seismologist Kerry Sieh said the interval between magnitude 7 
quakes under Downtown Los Angeles is probably 1,000 to 2,000 years. 
</P>
<P>
 But, he added, there are estimates that for the Los Angeles Basin as a whole, 
the interval between magnitude 7 earthquakes may be 100 to 300 years, and 
steel-frame high-rises are now common through many of the built-up areas within 
the basin. 
</P>
<P>
 The magnitude of the Jan. 17 Northridge earthquake has been put at 6.8, only 
half as powerful as a 7.0. 
</P>
<P>
 Times staff writers Richard Lee Colvin and Mark Platte contributed to this 
article.

STAR WITNESS RECOUNTS COLD FACTS OF TAY KILLING; COURTS: YOUTH WHO ADMITS HIS 
PART IN O.C. HONOR STUDENT'S DEATH TESTIFIES THAT FRIEND ROBERT CHAN 
ORCHESTRATED IT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Before he was slain on New Year's Eve, 1992, honors student Stuart A. Tay 
begged for help and cried, "What did I ever do to you?" as two teen-agers beat 
him with baseball bats and a sledgehammer. 
</P>
<P>
 Those details came Thursday from an 18-year-old Fullerton resident who 
recounted the final, brutal night of Tay's life as the murder trial unfolded 
for Robert Chan, the first of four teen-agers facing trial for the killing. 
</P>
<P>
 Calmly, almost clinically, the prosecution's star witness described how Chan, 
19, orchestrated the assault, joined the beating, then poured rubbing alcohol 
down Tay's throat before sealing the boy's mouth and nose with duct tape. 
</P>
<P>
 "He told me he had a grave ready for Stuart Tay," Charles Bae Choe testified 
before an Orange County Superior Court jury. He said he helped Chan and the 
others wrap Tay in a sheet before burying him in a Buena Park back yard. 
</P>
<P>
 In a county weary of gang crime and juvenile violence, Chan's trial stands out 
because both victim and accused were seemingly model youths who came from 
well-off, loving families. Chan, was a candidate for valedictorian at his high 
school; Tay, 17, had the grades to become a physician, like his father. 
</P>
<P>
 But defense and prosecuting attorneys in the case told jurors the evidence 
will reveal darker sides to the youths, who were apparently engaged in a 
high-stakes game of one-upmanship that involved "power trips" and bragging 
about gang involvement, counterfeiting and buying and selling weapons -- 
criminal activities that may or may not be true. 
</P>
<P>
 As the trial got underway Thursday morning, Chan's mother slid down in her 
seat and appeared to pass out in the courtroom's front row. The judge halted 
the defense attorney's opening statements as Suh Chan was helped from the 
courtroom by her husband, Tony, and treated by paramedics. She did not return 
to the trial. 
</P>
<P>
 When Choe took the witness stand later in the day, the youth sat with his 
hands and ankles shackled, frequently exchanging glances with Chan, who sat 
nearby at the defense table. 
</P>
<P>
 Choe has pleaded guilty to first-degree murder and was sentenced to the 
California Youth Authority, rather than state prison. He is helping prosecutors 
make their case against his childhood friend. 
</P>
<P>
 Three others charged in the case, Abraham Acosta, 17, of Buena Park, and Mun 
Bong Kang and Kirn Young Kim, both 18 and of Fullerton, face a separate trial. 
</P>
<P>
 But under questioning by prosecutors, Choe insisted that Chan was the 
ringleader. He said Chan arranged to have the grave dug in Acosta's back yard, 
and lured Tay to the family's garage under the guise of a meeting to sell Tay a 
handgun. 
</P>
<P>
 And he said it was Chan who bought the rubber gloves to eliminate telling 
fingerprints from the crime scene, and concocted a scheme to made Tay look like 
the victim of a carjacking by dropping Tay's sports car in Compton -- with the 
keys still in the ignition.  
</P>
<P>
 During a dress rehearsal the day of the slaying, he said, Chan made it clear 
he would give a sign -- a nod -- to Acosta, who would then attack Tay. Kim was 
assigned as a lookout by Chan, Choe said. 
</P>
<P>
 Choe said he stood by as the attack unfolded, but did not join in. 
</P>
<P>
 When Chan gave the prearranged nod, Acosta landed the first blow of the bat on 
Tay's head and was then joined by Chan, Choe said.  
</P>
<P>
 Tay "was crying, he was asking for help," Choe told the jury. 
</P>
<P>
 When one of the bats broke, Chan continued with a sledgehammer, Choe said. But 
even after a beating that Choe said lasted about 20 minutes, Tay was still 
breathing. He said that Chan turned the boy over, lifted his head and poured 
rubbing alcohol down his throat, then taped up Tay's mouth and nose. Tay 
ultimately choked to death on his own vomit. 
</P>
<P>
 Choe testified that it was Chan's idea to hose down the garage, which was 
splattered with blood, and to give all the murder weapons and bloodied clothing 
to another man to destroy, Choe said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The concrete floor was covered with blood and there was blood on the 
portraits, on the wall -- basically, there was blood everywhere," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Choe is expected to be released from the youth authority when he turns 25. On 
Thursday, Superior Court Judge Kathleen O'Leary refused to allow pictures of 
Choe in court out of concern for his safety in CYA. 
</P>
<P>
 When he continues cross examining Choe this morning, defense attorney Marshall 
M. Schulman is expected to portray Choe as a youth who will say anything to 
save his own skin. The attorney is trying to discredit Choe with his own 
admission that he cheated on his SAT test and originally agreed to join the 
other teens in a computer robbery in exchange for $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
 During questioning, Choe admitted that he has considered withdrawing his 
guilty plea and finding a new attorney because his parents believe his sentence 
is too severe. 
</P>
<P>
 In his opening statement Thursday, Schulman portrayed his client as suffering 
from paranoid schizophrenia. Chan was convinced that his own life was being 
threatened by Tay, who on occasion claimed he was a Secret Service agent or a 
member of the CIA, Schulman said. 
</P>
<P>
 In his fragile mental state, Chan, then 18, had come to believe Tay was a 
powerful gang member who had countless followers at his command, Schulman told 
jurors, setting the stage for a defense that will lay some of the blame on the 
victim. 
</P>
<P>
 Tay "didn't know Robert Chan was a mentally distressed man," Schulman said, 
adding that Tay was "feeding that mental distress to the extent he ended up in 
a grave" in Buena Park. 
</P>
<P>
 While prosecutors dispute whether such criminal activity or gang membership is 
true, Schulman told jurors that his client believed the claims and in many ways 
came to worship -- and fear -- Tay. 
</P>
<P>
 Chan, who is expected to testify, faces life in prison without parole if 
convicted. 
</P>
<P>
 During his opening statement, Schulman did not dwell on the killing itself, 
but instead outlined for jurors Chan's mental demise -- and highlighted his 
first meeting with Tay as an example of the sway the victim ultimately had over 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 In late 1992, Chan was surprised when someone handed him a playing card -- the 
ace of spades -- with no explanation during an academic decathlon at school. 
</P>
<P>
 He did not know Tay at the time. But that night, Tay used Chan's private pager 
number and stunned Chan by mentioning the card and other personal details -- 
such as what Chan wore that day, and his relationship with a cheerleader, 
Schulman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Impressed, Chan agreed to meet Tay and was immediately presented with a plan: 
Tay was looking for a partner to rob an Anaheim computer-parts dealer, Schulman 
said. The planned robbery fell apart when Chan found out Tay had given a phony 
name and told other lies, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Schulman sought to dispute the prosecution's attempt to portray his client as 
the mastermind, telling jurors that Acosta had in the past bragged about 
killing two people using bats, rubbing alcohol and tape -- the same methods 
used to kill Tay. Prosecutors, however, said they there no evidence that any 
such killings occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 After killing Tay, the teen-agers carefully cleaned up the crime scene and 
buried the body in a shallow grave, Choe said. Then, he said, he and Chan went 
out looking for New Year's Eve parties.

 But throughout his first day of persuading voters of his merits, Zedillo also 
confronted stark reminders that his will not be a traditional campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides getting started barely four months before the Aug. 21 elections, the 
Zedillo campaign confronts dissension within his party and the long shadow of 
the assassination of his predecessor, Luis Donaldo Colosio. Colosio's March 23 
murder, which occurred as the candidate left a campaign rally in Tijuana, is 
still under investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 The morning before arriving in this border town, Zedillo left wreaths at 
Colosio's grave in the northern village of Magdalena de Kino and at the Tijuana 
assassination site, where he spent just eight minutes under intense security 
and made no public statements. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, he traveled to a luxury Tijuana hotel, where he met with local 
political leaders and a handful of newspaper editors. 
</P>
<P>
 That gathering site contrasted sharply with Zedillo's first stop in Mexicali, 
Colonia Pueblo Nuevo, a neighborhood of graffiti-covered single-story concrete 
houses where he lived as a child. 
</P>
<P>
 Dressed in an olive jacket and casual slacks, Zedillo occasionally reached 
through the circle of security guards to shake hands with onlookers as he 
walked along the unpaved street to his old home. Stepping into the front yard 
of the rambling house, with rooms of different materials and heights added by a 
series of owners, he spotted an electrical cable. 
</P>
<P>
 "I almost electrocuted myself there," he told the current inhabitants. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, before a crowd of about 1,500 in the municipal auditorium, Zedillo said 
that growing up in a working-class neighborhood taught him that "our most 
important commitment is to those who have the least." 
</P>
<P>
 Zedillo also told the cheering supporters: "You have taught me to believe that 
there is no challenge that cannot be overcome."  
</P>
<P>
 Earlier in the day, a prominent politician reminded Zedillo of one challenge 
he must confront. Outspoken Mexico City Councilman Demetrio Sodi made it clear 
that the candidate is facing a split in the Institutional Revolutionary Party, 
known as the PRI, that has ruled Mexico for 65 years. 
</P>
<P>
 The PRI's track record made Zedillo, 43, a Yale-educated economist, the 
automatic front-runner when he was named last week to replace Colosio. But that 
position has also made him an easy target of criticism from outside the party 
and dissent from within it. 
</P>
<P>
 Sodi, a 19-year PRI veteran, quit the party Thursday over Zedillo's 
nomination, which was essentially the unilateral choice of outgoing President 
Carlos Salinas de Gortari. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am resigning from the PRI because I am convinced that Ernesto Zedillo and 
his team will be incapable of carrying out the political and social reforms the 
country demands," Sodi said at a Mexico City news conference. "Zedillo is 
undoubtedly an intelligent and honorable man, but someone without political 
experience." 
</P>
<P>
 Other democracy-minded party activists, notably the Democracy 2000 movement, 
have also threatened to resign over the nomination, but Sodi is the first to 
actually do so. 
</P>
<P>
 Zedillo has responded indirectly to such threats by invoking the name of the 
slain candidate to call for party unity in speeches and in the few interviews 
he has granted. 
</P>
<P>
 The rally here included a moment of silence for Colosio, and Zedillo began his 
remarks by saying he is carrying on for his fallen friend. 
</P>
<P>
 But the frequent tributes to Colosio, victim of Mexico's most shocking 
political murder in 66 years, have begun to provoke criticism from opposition 
parties. The weekly magazine Proceso said in its latest issue that Zedillo 
remains in Colosio's shadow. 
</P>
<P>
 Concern about such criticism was the reason Zedillo excluded the reporters 
traveling with him from the grave and murder site visits, a campaign source 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier in the week, Zedillo met at PRI headquarters with representatives of 
party factions, such as labor and farmers, who pledged their support. 
</P>
<P>
 This "buffalo stampede" is the traditional preamble to a PRI presidential 
campaign, followed by a trip to a town outside Mexico City that is linked to 
the candidate's childhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Zedillo was born in Mexico City, but moved to Mexicali as a small boy and 
lived here for several years before returning to the capital to study. 
</P>
<P>
 For the visit, the city has debuted Zedillo campaign billboards. Until 
Thursday, PRI advertising had been restricted to Colosio signs with freshly 
painted black ribbons.

ELECTIONS; STATE TREASURER BACKS ROBERTI WEAPONS BILL; POLITICS: VALLEY SENATOR 
ESCALATES HIS FIGHT AGAINST RECALL CAMPAIGN BY GAINING THE SUPPORT OF KATHLEEN 
BROWN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CYNTHIA H. CRAFT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With only days remaining before his recall election, state Sen. David A. 
Roberti escalated his campaign Thursday by enlisting Treasurer Kathleen Brown's 
support for a new bill to patch loopholes in his 5-year-old assault weapon ban. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberti's move elevates the battle over his San Fernando Valley seat into the 
realm of gubernatorial politics as Brown -- the front-running Democratic 
candidate for governor -- stepped forward to champion the senator's bill. 
</P>
<P>
 Calling the legislation "a top priority of my comprehensive crime package," 
Brown challenged Gov. Pete Wilson and other prominent figures to line up behind 
the bill. 
</P>
<P>
 If passed, the legislation will broaden the scope of Roberti's 1989 Assault 
Weapon Control Act by adding a generic description of semiautomatic guns to the 
law, which now lists banned weapons by name. 
</P>
<P>
 Firearms manufacturers have been getting around the law by making identical 
weapons under different names from those identified under the ban. They also 
skirt the ban by making slight changes in new models of forbidden guns. 
</P>
<P>
 Under sunny skies at a rural Sacramento firing range, Roberti introduced Brown 
as "a spokesperson and co-sponsor" of his legislation. Joined by San Francisco 
Dist. Atty. Arlo Smith, the politicians stood by as Tony Beard, Senate sergeant 
at arms, shot up watermelons in an effort to demonstrate the firepower of 
so-called "copycat" assault weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know what it takes to pass gun control legislation," Roberti said in 
explaining why he sought a high-profile personality like Brown to back his 
bill. "The gun lobby can beat the public with all kinds of political 
intimidation behind closed doors. . . . That's why we need someone as public on 
our side as a candidate for governor." 
</P>
<P>
 In recent weeks, nothing, it seems, has raised the profile of the gun-control 
debate like Roberti's recall election, with the national media portraying him 
as a David to the firearms lobby's Goliath. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberti's campaign has fueled that image, recruiting the backing of such 
prominent figures as former White House press secretary James Brady, who was 
wounded in an assassination attempt on former President Ronald Reagan; his 
wife, Sarah Brady, who heads Handgun Control Inc.; actor Beau Bridges, who 
played Brady in a TV movie, and survivors who lost family members to assault 
weapon violence. 
</P>
<P>
 While recall proponents confirm that Roberti's 1989 assault weapon ban spurred 
a movement against him, they say he is using the issue as a smoke screen to 
hide from charges of carpetbagging, political corruption and liberalism. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked why he waited until just days before his election to introduce his 
fix-it bill, Roberti blamed his timing on distractions created by the recall 
drive. 
</P>
<P>
 "This highlights the problem of the recall. It interrupts your term and the 
work you do," the Van Nuys Democrat said, noting that he and Brown had been 
negotiating a bill for two months. 
</P>
<P>
 Up until December, Roberti said, he felt that his 1989 law was sufficient to 
control assault weapons in California, as long as state officials could 
continue to add more guns to the list of banned firearms. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, when he first introduced the bill five years ago, it had contained a 
generic description of semiautomatic weapons that he later had to drop to get 
enough votes to pass the initial legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, in December, a gun manufacturer obtained another in a series of court 
injunctions against the law that allows state officials to go after copycat 
weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was the straw that broke the camel's back," Roberti said. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown said the bill fits in perfectly with her campaign message of trying to 
reverse California's down slide. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the issue is the decline of California -- in the economy, in the 
number of jobs lost, in the quality of education and in the decline in safety," 
Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is so important that we move beyond simple slogans and 30-second spots and 
join together -- Republican and Democrat, Pete Wilson and Kathleen Brown -- to 
support this legislation," Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson's office said he has not yet seen the bill, which is tentatively 
scheduled to be assigned to a Senate committee next week for its first public 
hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't speak to Ms. Brown's comments, but I do know the governor has a very 
good record in this area," said Wilson spokesman Sean Walsh, noting that the 
governor signed the 1989 assault weapon ban. 
</P>
<P>
 But Darry Sragow, gubernatorial campaign manager for Insurance Commissioner 
John Garamendi, took a shot at his boss's Democratic primary rival, saying, 
"This is another example of Kathleen Brown trying to cover herself by adopting 
somebody else's proposal. And she's not even a member of the Legislature." 
</P>
<P>
 At any rate, Sragow said, Garamendi supports a generic ban on assault weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 The final Democrat in the primary, state Sen. Tom Hayden (D-Santa Monica), 
will lend his support to Roberti's bill too, said his spokesman, Duane 
Peterson. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, in the Valley, the 20th Senate District Republican Central 
Committee announced its endorsement of GOP candidate Dolores White, one of 
Roberti's five opponents in the recall. 
</P>
<P>
 White, 59, is a real estate broker who previously ran against Roberti in 1992.

O.C. BANK ROBBER SUSPECTED IN OTHER HOLDUPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK I. PINSKY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An armed man wearing a fake beard and mustache and a baseball cap, who may be 
a suspect in numerous South County and San Diego County holdups, robbed a 
Mission Viejo bank Wednesday of $6,900, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 A 4:20 p.m., the man walked into the Wells Fargo Bank at 25276 Marguerite 
Parkway, gave a note to a teller and revealed a gun, said sheriff's Lt. Jay 
Mendez. 
</P>
<P>
 The man then demanded cash in large bills, which he stuffed into a bag he was 
carrying, Mendez said, and walked out of the bank. No shots were fired, and no 
one in the bank was injured. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses told police the man was in his late 20s to 30s, 5 feet 10 inches 
tall and weighed about 150 pounds. He wore sunglasses and a blue, black and 
white lightweight jacket, Mendez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mendez said authorities think the man may be the "fake beard bandit," 
suspected of 33 bank robberies in South County, San Diego and Texas, starting 
in 1986. The last robbery committed by someone by the same description took 
place in Laguna Niguel in 1992.

MUSIC MAVEN; DOUG MORRIS HAS SET THE TONE FOR THE DINOSAUR-TO-DIVA RISE OF 
ATLANTIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES BATES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One of Doug Morris' first jobs in music in the 1960s was working as an 
assistant to the late songwriter Bert Berns, known for such hits as "Twist and 
Shout" and "Hang On, Sloopy." 
</P>
<P>
 A periodic task was to cash Berns' paychecks at a bank. Morris would then head 
over to Atlantic Records' New York studio, where he would deliver the cash to 
Berns. 
</P>
<P>
 Some 30 years later, Morris is still delivering the cash at Atlantic, albeit 
in considerably higher sums. As co-chairman and co-chief executive of Time 
Warner's Atlantic Group, Morris in four years has transformed a label that was 
widely perceived as a dinosaur into one of the industry's hottest music labels. 
</P>
<P>
 Atlantic has the biggest market share of all the major labels so far this year 
in the new releases category, with 8.8% (including catalogue sales, its overall 
market share is 8.22%, placing it third). It has also held the lead in new 
releases sales for the past two weeks, thanks to the rap soundtrack from the 
film "Above the Rim" from Atlantic's Interscope partnership and the Texas rock 
group Pantera's "Far Beyond Driven" from Atlantic's EastWest Records. Also 
continuing to sell is music from rap star Snoop Doggy Dogg on Interscope, the 
alternative rock band Stone Temple Pilots and country star John Michael 
Montgomery. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Atlantic nor its parent, Warner Music Group, will discuss sales 
numbers. But music industry sources estimate that its worldwide revenue soared 
from about $400 million in 1991 to about $750 million in 1993. Some say it's 
possible that with its most recent spurt Atlantic may account for as much as 
40% of the Warner Music Group's business now. 
</P>
<P>
 As little as five years ago, Atlantic was, as one prominent record producer 
put it, "in the toilet." It was known for surviving mainly on the basis of its 
rich, but aging, catalogue of music from such groups as Led Zeppelin, Crosby, 
Stills & Nash and Genesis. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were (viewed) everywhere as an old warhorse company that lived off its 
catalogue. A lot of things deteriorated in the company. It was very 
depressing," Morris says. 
</P>
<P>
 The change came in 1990, when a blunt message came from Warner Music Chairman 
Robert Morgado that Atlantic wasn't cutting it. 
</P>
<P>
 Atlantic founder Ahmet Ertegun, who still shares the co-chairman and co-chief 
executive titles, agreed to give management authority to Morris, 54, a former 
songwriter from Long Island (he wrote the Chiffon's 1966 hit "Sweet Talkin' 
Guy") and one-time music producer (his credits include "Smokin' in the Boys 
Room" for Brownsville Station in the 1970s). 
</P>
<P>
 What is unusual about Atlantic's revamping is that it wasn't accomplished by 
an outsider brought in to clean things up, but by someone who cooled his heels 
for years before finally getting his chance. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's clear the company had to be repositioned," Morgado said. "If you are 
able to find someone to do the job from the inside it's usually the preferable 
approach." Competitors say that Morris' time in the trenches writing, producing 
and peddling songs has given him invaluable experience that helps him now that 
he finally has clout. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've watched him come up from the days where he literally delivered records 
in a station wagon to stores," said Thomas D. Mottola, Sony Music Entertainment 
president and chief operating officer. "He's come through the ranks. He's a 
music man. He's a veteran who has learned by trial and error." 
</P>
<P>
 After taking charge, Morris began a spending spree that included bolstering a 
video arm, cutting deals with such innovative labels as Rhino Records, Matador 
and Mammoth as well as forming a joint venture with mogul Ted Field and 
producer Jimmy Iovine for Interscope Records. He founded a country division, 
and formed a subsidiary label called EastWest, naming Sylvia Rhone, the 
industry's most senior African American woman, as chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
 The result of all his moves, Morris recalled, was "big expenses and little 
sales" in 1991, resulting in Atlantic's first ever loss since it was founded in 
1948. Said Morris: "I was terrified. I said to myself, 'What have I put in 
motion?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Danny Goldberg, a former artists' manager who Morris has tapped to run his 
Atlantic Records unit, credits Morris with sticking with the long-term 
investments despite the losses. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a tremendous temptation when in the short term you need to show a 
quarterly profit to show an accountant's mentality toward this business," 
Goldberg said. "That means cutting costs and living off the catalogue. We have 
a strong catalogue, so you can meet your numbers that way, but you are eating 
your seed corn. You need to keep breaking and developing artists." 
</P>
<P>
 Atlantic's most biggest and most visible deal was with Interscope, which it 
plans to eventually acquire outright. Although its music is relatively diverse, 
Interscope is best known for rap. That association has generated plenty of 
unwanted press for Time Warner, from controversy over rapper Ice-T's 
controversial "Cop Killer" song two years ago to murder charges pending against 
Snoop Doggy Dogg, who maintains he is innocent. 
</P>
<P>
 Morris acknowledges that he walks a fine line in handling controversy. "The 
only answer to me is to trust the executives we have in place. The main thing 
I'm looking to protect is Time Warner. We don't want to hurt the mother 
company," Morris says. 
</P>
<P>
 Says producer Iovine: "Doug is very practical. He knows that great music and 
music that is progressive or ahead of its time is going to be controversial." 
</P>
<P>
 Morris has just cut a deal with heavy metal producer Dave Jerde. He has also 
recruited Grammy-winning producer David Foster as a vice president to bolster 
Atlantic's pop music standing, and has been in talks to bring aboard A&M 
Records founders Herb Alpert and Jerry Moss. Other recent ventures include 
forming an audio books division. 
</P>
<P>
 Morris is in demand for deals, and is sometimes attracting them in unusual 
ways. He recently found himself in a bidding war at a charity auction for a 
block of time on MTV. Each time Morris bid, a man in the back topped him. 
</P>
<P>
 He lost that day to fashion designer Tommy Hilfiger. But the two men chatted 
after the auction, which led to a joint venture on MTV and VH-1 that just 
debuted in which Hilfiger visits celebrities at home to look over their 
wardrobes. Atlantic's Share

SHOE MANUFACTURER VANS INC. FACES UNION VOTE; LABOR: DISPUTE WITH THE ORANGE 
COUNTY FIRM CENTERS ON WORKERS' SHARE OF HEALTH BENEFITS -- WHICH TAKES A LARGE 
CHUNK OF THEIR PAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBORA VRANA, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For the first time in the company's 28-year history, Orange-based Vans Inc. 
will watch today as 1,400 manufacturing workers vote on whether to form a union 
at the largest plant operated by the maker of canvas shoes. 
</P>
<P>
 The election is a sign of dissatisfaction among some of the company's mostly 
Latino employees, who, the Teamsters union says, cannot afford to pay their 
share for health benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 Union leaders in Southern California are closely watching the bitterly 
contested election as an test of their ability to organize a growing group of 
immigrant factory workers, most of them Latino, who in the past have resisted 
unionization. 
</P>
<P>
 Vans is fighting the organizing effort aggressively. Executives say the 
company cannot afford higher wages and more benefits at a time when shoe sales 
have been stalled and profits have been eroding. 
</P>
<P>
 Increasingly, manufacturing workers in Southern California, especially 
eager-to-assimilate immigrants, are seeking additional workplace benefits, 
according to labor leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is currently a genuine interest in organizing within the immigrant 
community, especially Latinos," said Miguel Caballero, legal director of the 
California Immigrant Workers Assn., a union-sponsored group in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "For years, there has been an anti-immigrant bias by some units that saw 
immigrants used to break strikes or lower wages. But I think unions nationwide 
are taking a look at their policies." 
</P>
<P>
 The central issue in the Vans election is the workers' ability to afford the 
company's health benefits. The average Vans employee, according to the union, 
makes about $5.75 an hour and finds the coverage too expensive. 
</P>
<P>
 The situation facing Vans' workers highlights a problem of the working poor in 
America -- a vast majority of whom do not have employer-provided health care 
either because none is offered or because they find the employee premium 
contributions are unaffordable. 
</P>
<P>
 Vans executives said they are closely watching President Clinton's health care 
reform program, which has measures that would require universal coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, Vans has struggled to retain market share in the highly 
competitive casual shoe market. For years, it rarely changed the style of its 
basic sneakers, a staple for many Southern California teen-aged males, 
especially surfers. 
</P>
<P>
 But as worldwide shoe sales dropped, the company announced last year it would 
introduce new styles and colors -- adding a paisley pattern for its women's 
shoe line and new canvas shoes that match denim work jackets. 
</P>
<P>
 The strategy seems to be working. In March, Vans reported that domestic sales 
of its shoes jumped 19% from the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, in front of a Vans shoe plant in the city of Orange, union 
organizers held a afternoon rally, attracting nearly 30 workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Carrying a Teamsters Local 396 sign and waving to honking cars was Filomena 
Ramirez, 36, who has worked for the company for 14 years as a shoe seamstress. 
</P>
<P>
 She said she currently makes $6.50 an hour or about $218 per week and can't 
afford the company's health plan, which would cost $60 each week to cover her 
and her family. Her sister, Berta Vargas Lopez, 34, also works at the company. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, we're afraid we will lose our jobs, but we want to have benefits and we 
just can't afford it," said Ramirez. "I expected better conditions in the 
United States, but I see now that with the union we can get it." 
</P>
<P>
 Vans' attorney Craig Gosselin acknowledged that the company's health care plan 
is costly for many employees, but said it would be less expensive if more of 
the workers would join. He said Vans gave a 2.7% across-the-board pay increase 
to workers in March and pays 60% of the cost of medical coverage for all 
employees. 
</P>
<P>
 "We pay at least 25% higher than minimum wage and these are low-skilled jobs," 
Gosselin said. "You're talking about making shoes. The union is creating a lot 
of confusion and unrest here. That's their job, but it's infuriating. We've had 
to spend a lot of money fighting this because they are confusing people." 
</P>
<P>
 But union supporter Hector Sanchez, a 28-year-old shoe maker, who has worked 
at the company since 1983, said he is not confused. He said workers are under 
pressure to produce, that he makes 750 pairs of shoes a day and was recently 
asked to increase that to 800 pairs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are under so much pressure and if we have a problem there is nobody to 
help us," he said. "The company just says if you don't like this job -- the 
door is over there. Sometimes people cry and don't say anything if they want to 
keep their job." 
</P>
<P>
 Gosselin said the company had dropped a plan to step up production, however. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Vans plant, at least 10 workers wore "Viva Vans!" buttons with the word 
union circled and crossed out. They said they supported the company and wanted 
no part of the union.

PICKS UP IN CALIFORNIA. CHAINS WITH A MAJOR PRESENCE IN THE STATE MARK SURGE IN 
MARCH BUSINESS.

 Most of the nation's major retailers reported higher sales than expected in 
March as warmer weather and an early Easter prompted a buying spree in spring 
apparel, marking an end to months of pent-up demand for clothing. 
</P>
<P>
 There were also signs of some economic recovery in California, which has 
trailed the rest of the nation in retail activity since 1990, as sales surged 
at retail chains with a major presence in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 "The California economy is improving, and retail sales are beginning to 
reflect that development," said Walter Loeb, a New York-based retail analyst. 
</P>
<P>
 Sales at Los Angeles-based Carter Hawley Hale Stores -- operator of the 
Broadway department store chain -- rose largely because of increased demand for 
men's clothing, women's clothing and home furnishings. Carter Hawley's 
same-store sales -- revenue from stores open at least 12 months -- rose 6.4% 
from a year ago.  
</P>
<P>
 The St. Louis-based May Department Stores, operator of California's 
Robinsons-May department store chain, reported a same-store sales increase of 
12.8%. 
</P>
<P>
 R.H. Macy & Co., which operates the Bullock's and I. Magnin chains, reported a 
same-store increase of 14.4%. Macy, which is reorganizing under Chapter 11 
bankruptcy, is trying to stave off a potential takeover bid by Cincinnati-based 
Federated Department Stores. Federated reported a same-store increase of 3.1%. 
</P>
<P>
 Minneapolis-based Dayton Hudson Corp., another retailer with a strong presence 
in California, had a 8.5% same-store sales increase. The retailer operates the 
Target and Mervyn's chains. Nationwide, Target had a 12% same-store increase in 
sales. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sales increases at Target's stores in California were consistent with 
Target's nationwide performance," said Ann Barkelew, a Dayton Hudson 
spokeswoman. "It was a good month." 
</P>
<P>
 Mervyn's same-store sales increases were only 6% nationwide, and increases in 
the chain's California sales, on average, were even lower. However, sales at 
Mervyn's 47 Los Angeles-area stores were strong largely because of demand for 
apparel, said Sandy Salyer, a Mervyn's spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
 Nationwide retail sales rose 11.1%, according to the Salomon Bros. retail 
index, compared to an increase of only 1% in March, 1993, when sales in much of 
the nation were slowed by a blizzard. Analysts say the nation's retailers will 
have a strong 1994 if apparel sales continue to surge. 
</P>
<P>
 "Consumers remain very price-conscious, but if clothing sales are strong again 
in April, we might expect a yearlong resurgence in apparel sales," said Kurt 
Barnard, a retail economist and editor of Barnard's Retail Marketing Report. 
</P>
<P>
 Specialty apparel retailers were among the companies benefiting from the surge 
in demand for apparel. Gap Inc. said same-store sales rose 16%, and The Limited 
Inc. reported a 7% increase for the month. 
</P>
<P>
 Wal-Mart, the nation's No. 1 retailer, said same-store sales rose 15%, while 
Sears, Roebuck & Co. said its March sales were up 16.8%. Also, J.C. Penney said 
it had a March increase of 13.7%. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, Kmart Corp. had more modest gains, reporting a same-store 
sales increase of 4.5% for the month.

CITY ATTORNEY ACCUSES RALPHS OF OVERCHARGING AT SOME STORES; SUPERMARKETS: THE 
CHAIN PAID A FINE IN A SIMILAR CASE IN 1992. THE FIRM'S PRESIDENT SAYS REMEDIAL 
ACTION HAS BEEN TAKEN. 
</P>

<P>
 For the second time in less than two years, the Los Angeles city attorney's 
office has filed criminal charges against Ralphs Grocery Co. for allegedly 
overcharging customers at some of its Los Angeles stores. 
</P>
<P>
 City Atty. Jim Hahn on Thursday filed 24 misdemeanor charges against Ralphs -- 
Southern California's third-largest grocery chain -- and 10 of its store 
supervisors. The charges include 17 counts of false advertising and seven 
counts of overcharging customers at the checkout counter. 
</P>
<P>
 The accusations resulted from inspections by the Los Angeles County Department 
of Weights and Measures at 10 supermarkets in the San Fernando Valley and in 
central and west Los Angeles. The inspections found that the prices registered 
by computerized price scanners at the checkout counter were sometimes different 
from prices posted on the stores' shelves, according to the city attorney's 
office. 
</P>
<P>
 Ralphs paid $3,500 in fines to settle similar charges brought by the city 
attorney in 1992. Those charged in Thursday's complaint could face fines 
ranging from $1,000 to $2,500 and could possibly serve six months in jail. 
</P>
<P>
 Ralphs President Al Marasca said Thursday that the company was made aware of 
the new allegations last fall and has since taken "substantial remedial 
action." After the 1992 charges, the city attorney said that Ralphs had agreed 
to implement a $1-million training and price accuracy program for its staff. 
</P>
<P>
 Marasca said the Weights and Measures inspectors targeted expired shelf tags. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no scan error," Marasca said in a statement released Thursday. 
"These are human errors that occur when several hundred items go off sale at 
the same time and some of the special tags are not removed." 
</P>
<P>
 Violators of laws relating to pricing are liable even if the inaccurate 
pricing is unintentional, said Deputy City Atty. Don Cocek. Cocek said the city 
had no evidence that the alleged violations were deliberate or part of Ralphs 
corporate policy. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the city attorney's office, the Department of Weights and 
Measures' random purchases of items at the targeted Ralphs stores indicated a 
significant error rate. The spot checks suggested that the scanners were 
inaccurate nearly 16% of the time, according to the city attorney's office.

QUAKE TAB FOR INSURED DAMAGE AT $4.5 BILLION; CLAIMS: NEW INDUSTRY ESTIMATES 
MAKE THE JAN. 17 NORTHRIDGE TEMBLOR THE NO. 2 INSURANCE DISASTER IN U.S. 
HISTORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The insurance industry Thursday raised its official estimate of insured damage 
from the Northridge earthquake to $4.5 billion, making the Jan. 17 quake the 
second-worst insurance disaster in U.S. history behind 1992's Hurricane Andrew. 
</P>
<P>
 The revised estimate by the Property Claims Services division of the American 
Insurance Services Group Inc. was nearly double the trade organization's 
initial $2.5-billion figure, released in February. 
</P>
<P>
 For weeks, insurance analysts have been expecting a sharp upward revision in 
the damage tally as companies hiked their individual loss estimates. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the largest insurers, State Farm's estimate climbed to $1 billion from 
$600 million; Allstate's was $600 million, up from $350 million, and 20th 
Century's was $325 million, up from $160 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The insured loss total is far lower than the overall damage caused by the 
6.8-magnitude Northridge quake, since it does not include damage to uninsured 
public property such as freeway overpasses and government buildings. Nor does 
it include losses suffered by people without earthquake insurance or losses 
that fall below the insurance deductibles. 
</P>
<P>
 The Federal Emergency Management Agency said Thursday that its current 
estimate of overall losses is $13 billion to $15 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 "The amount of actual damage to many buildings was not at first visible," said 
Gary R. Kerney, spokesman for Property Claims Services. 
</P>
<P>
 The extent of the destruction became clearer after construction engineers and 
other experts visited the damaged buildings, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 While the number of expected claims payouts did not grow substantially from 
the first estimate to the second, the average cost per claim soared. 
</P>
<P>
 The trade group now estimates the number of claims on which there will be a 
payment to reach nearly 260,000, up from its earlier estimate of 230,000. Some 
210,000 of the claims will be on residences, 23,000 on automobiles and 25,000 
on businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 The average payments will be $15,000 on personal property claims (homes and 
their contents), $55,000 on commercial claims and $1,800 on auto claims, 
Property Claims Services estimated. 
</P>
<P>
 Kerney said it was not unprecedented for the group to dramatically revise its 
estimate for a large disaster. Initial estimates for Hurricane Andrew also were 
low. It took six months before a final estimate was prepared for Andrew.  
</P>
<P>
 Two major California insurers, 20th Century and Farmers Group, recently were 
notified that expected quake losses had prompted a review of their financial 
security ratings. 
</P>
<P>
 A.M. Best Co., the Oldwick, N.J.-based ratings agency, said it instituted the 
ratings reviews after the two carriers had announced their claims estimates.

 Nissan to Replace Some Air Bags: Nissan Motor Co. is recalling 71,500 Maxima 
sedans sold in the United States and Canada to replace air bag sensors.The 
voluntary recall applies to 1992 and early 1993 model Maximas. The Japanese car 
maker said it will install an updated sensor that is less sensitive to minor 
underbody impacts, reducing the possibility that the air bag will deploy under 
such situations. A Nissan spokesman said 73 car owners reported air bag 
deployments when their cars' underbodies struck curbs and other objects.

 Fluor Corp. Sells Lead Mining Operation: The Irvine-based international 
engineering and construction company said the sale of its Doe Run Co. 
subsidiary to an affiliate of the Renco Group in New York would have no impact 
on the corporation's earnings -- meaning it likely sold for the $175 million at 
which Fluor valued the subsidiary's assets. But Fluor still stands to glean big 
benefits from the sale: Renco has relieved Fluor of all liabilities from the 
mining and sale of lead products.Lead is a toxic metal and Fluor officials 
worried about the potentially huge cost of cleaning up mining and processing 
sites and of the potential for damaging litigation by workers and consumers who 
might claim their health had been injured by lead mined in Doe Run operations. 
Fluor's common stock rose $1.625 to $53.75 a share on the New York Stock 
Exchange, closing at $53.75 a share. The Doe Run sale was announced after the 
market closed.

 Borrowing Rises More Slowly Than Expected: Consumer credit rose $3.5 billion 
in February -- the ninth straight increase -- but at a much slower pace than 
many analysts expected.Borrowing climbed at a 5.3% annual rate, the smallest 
increase since a 3.4% advance last June, the Federal Reserve said. Many 
economists had predicted borrowing would increase twice as much. The Federal 
Reserve also reported that consumer credit rose $6.4 billion in January, 
revised upward from an estimated $6 billion a month ago.

maker of the Miracle Ear hearing aid agreed to pay $700,000 to 15 states,

Sassano, Dahlberg president and chief executive, said the company settled to 
avoid costly litigation. Dahlberg is the nation's third-largest manufacturer of

HOTEL BEL-AIR REPORTED FOR SALE; BOUGHT BY JAPANESE IN 1980S 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Staff and Wire Reports

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Japanese company is seeking to sell the Hotel Bel-Air in West Los Angeles, 
acquired for more than $100 million in the late 1980s during a Japanese buying 
spree of well-known American properties, a financier said here Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 If the sale goes through, it would mark the latest Japanese retreat from 
spectacular real estate purchases made in those years. The Japanese tycoon who 
bought the Pebble Beach golf resort in 1990 was thought to have lost $340 
million when he sold it in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sazale Group, which paid about $110 million for the legendary hotel, wants 
to sell it as part of a restructuring plan, according to an official of the 
Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan, which helped finance the purchase. 
</P>
<P>
 The official, who asked that his name not be used, said Sazale transferred the 
title of the hotel in mid-March to HBA Holdings Co., a wholly owned subsidiary 
of the bank set up specifically to hold the property. 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles, a spokeswoman for the hotel initially told The Times that the 
Bel-Air was for sale, but minutes later called back to say that it was not on 
the sales block. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Braun, a New York attorney who represents the Sazale Group, said 
Sazale had received "a few" inquiries from potential buyers before the company 
deeded the property back to its lenders in March.  
</P>
<P>
 At least one large real estate investment company -- Los Angeles-based Colony 
Capital Inc. -- has expressed an interest in purchasing the property and 
reportedly has offered to pay about $50 million for it in recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Kelvin Davis, Colony's executive vice president, confirmed that his company is 
interested in buying the Bel-Air but would not disclose the price Colony would 
be willing to pay. 
</P>
<P>
 However, another investor -- music mogul David Geffen -- denied published 
reports that he has also offered to buy the hotel for about $50 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have not made a bid on the property, nor has anyone who represents me," 
Geffen told The Times on Thursday. However, he said he would like to see the 
hotel's financial statements and would not rule out making a bid later. 
</P>
<P>
 Sazale stunned investors worldwide when it bought the 92-room hotel in 1989 
for a record $1.2 million per room.

U.S. BUSINESSES PLAN BIG SPENDING SPREE; ECONOMY: COMMERCE DEPARTMENT SAYS 8% 
INCREASE IN '94 REPRESENTS THE MOST CAPITAL INVESTMENT IN FIVE YEARS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Encouraged by the expanding economy, American businesses are planning a big 
increase in investments for new buildings and equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 The Commerce Department said Thursday that businesses plan an 8% increase in 
1994, which would be the biggest increase in capital investment since an 11.4% 
jump in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest figure is sharply higher than the estimated 5.4% rise that 
businesses had projected just three months ago. Last year's increase was 7.1%. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's consistent with the recent stronger-than-expected growth in the 
economy," said economist Priscilla Trumbull of the WEFA Group, a Bala Cynwyd, 
Pa.-based forecasting firm. 
</P>
<P>
 She said she was not surprised that the government attributed a big part of 
the projected rise to the automobile industry. "Car sales have really been much 
stronger than three to six months ago," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 In other reports Thursday: 
</P>
<P>
 * The number of Americans filing first-time claims for jobless benefits rose 
by 6,000 last week, the Labor Department said. 
</P>
<P>
 * Thirty-year, fixed-rate mortgages averaged 8.47% this week, up from 8.04% 
last week and the highest in nearly two years, according to the Federal Home 
Loan Mortgage Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 Commerce Secretary Ron Brown said of the rising investment-spending plans, 
"The increase demonstrates that investment is not being choked off by the 
recent run-up in long-term (interest) rates." He said improving profits and 
cash flow, and strong demand also are spurring more investment. 
</P>
<P>
 Marilyn Schaja of Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corp. in New York, 
said of the jobs report: "The data fit with the impression of a gradually 
improving labor market, not one that is roaring ahead." 
</P>
<P>
 The reports did not appear to have a dramatic impact on the stock market, 
which was mixed after a recovery earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Several thousand businesses surveyed by the Commerce Department during the 
first quarter of 1994 said they would spend $633 billion this year -- up from 
$586 billion last year -- on constructing and modernizing buildings, installing 
new computers, and upgrading other equipment and machinery. 
</P>
<P>
 Spending rose 3.4% in 1992 after a rare 0.8% decline in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Companies have been buying computers and other high-tech equipment to 
streamline their operations. Until recently, payroll expansion has not kept 
pace. But last week, the Labor Department reported that 456,000 Americans were 
added to payrolls in March, the biggest increase in more than six years. 
</P>
<P>
 Manufacturers plan a 7.5% increase in investment spending this year, compared 
to a 3% rise in 1993. Non-manufacturing companies plan an 8.3% jump on top of 
last year's 9.1% increase.

 As the Southern California's tourism industry remained sluggish, the federal 
government on Thursday pledged $3 million to help mount a television 
advertising campaign aimed at attracting visitors to the area in the summer 
after the Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 But the quake relief grant, announced by U.S. Commerce Secretary Ronald H. 
Brown during a hearing on federal help for California tourism, was less than 
was originally requested and met with some opposition from a hotel union. The 
California Tourism Summit saw a wide range of groups -- from San Diego 
convention boosters to Los Angeles arts groups -- suggest ways the federal 
government could help the state's tourist industry, which generates an 
estimated $54 billion in annual revenues. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we need to stimulate California tourism today is money," Julie Meier 
Wright, secretary of the California Department of Commerce, told members of the 
Travel and Tourism Advisory Board, which advises the Commerce Department on 
travel issues. "Our problem in California is a lack of resources." 
</P>
<P>
 Visitor spending in the Los Angeles area is expected to decline by $308 
million this year as a result of the January quake, according to a recent study 
commissioned by the Los Angeles Convention & Visitors Bureau. Some hotels and 
attractions report that advance summer bookings are sluggish, according to 
bureau officials. 
</P>
<P>
 The quake "rattled our most important industry -- tourism," Mayor Richard 
Riordan said. The grant "will help us market Los Angeles as a travel 
destination this summer." 
</P>
<P>
 The state itself has asked the federal government for $15 million in aid to 
help promote California tourism. U.S. Commerce Department officials said the 
state's request is still under consideration. 
</P>
<P>
 "This Administration believes that tourism can be a successful tool, an 
engine, for economic growth," said Brown, whose father was a manager of a New 
York hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 But Brown did not indicate that any more federal financial aid was readily 
available to help the state's tourist industry. Although some who spoke at the 
hearing sought non-monetary help to promote the domestic cruise industry and 
increase customs facilities, most asked for cash. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first thing that people ask for is money," said Darryl Hartley-Leonard, 
chairman of the Travel Advisory Board, which organized Thursday's hearing. "But 
trying to get more dollars today, given the Administration's determination to 
cut the deficit, is difficult." 
</P>
<P>
 The $3-million federal grant, which must still receive final authorization 
from Congress and is contingent on $2 million in local matching funds, will be 
used by the Los Angeles Convention & Visitors Bureau to launch a $5-million ad 
campaign. The bureau agreed to provide $1 million of its own money and raise 
another $1 million from the private sector to win the federal grant, said 
spokesman Gary C. Sherwin. 
</P>
<P>
 The promotion is scheduled to begin May 23 with 30- and 60-second commercials 
in 10 cities in the Western United States -- such as Reno and Dallas -- that 
are major sources of Los Angeles-bound tourists. The promotions rank as one of 
the largest sponsored by the bureau and its first campaign aimed directly at 
travelers in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 The federal grant was criticized by members of the Hotel Employees & 
Restaurant Employees Union, who claim the industry exploits workers with low 
pay and meager benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 "The government is contributing to the very cause of social problems that give 
the city a bad image," said local union president Maria Elena Durazo, after a 
brief and impromptu meeting with Brown in a convention center hallway. 
</P>
<P>
 Tourist officials conceded that they must also deal with social problems -- 
such as violence and poverty -- that hurt their industry.  
</P>
<P>
 "Today's grant is like a Band-Aid for the real problems of the state of 
California and the nation," said Hartley-Leonard. "Until we address the issues, 
we are going to have a perception problem and a reality problem."

POWER TURBINE PROJECT SAVES TECH CENTER FROM CLOSING; ENGINEERING: THE 
THERMODYNAMICS TESTING PROGRAM WILL KEEP THE FACILITY WORKING AND SAVE 200 
JOBS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The Department of Energy announced Thursday that it will keep open its Energy 
Technology Engineering Center near Simi Valley for research in a promising new 
technology for electrical power generation, known as the Kalina Cycle. 
</P>
<P>
 The center had been scheduled to be closed in September, with a loss of 200 
high-tech jobs. It is operated by the Rocketdyne division of Rockwell 
International, which for decades tested components for nuclear power plants at 
the site. 
</P>
<P>
 "The issue in my mind was that we cannot lose this resource," Energy Secretary 
Hazel O'Leary said Thursday at a news conference in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The center, part of DOE's Santa Susana Field Laboratory, is now assured of 
support through 1995, and will get a budget hike of $11.6 million, most of it 
to test the new technology, a prototype of which is already in place. 
</P>
<P>
 Community groups and proponents of an advanced transportation industry in 
Southern California have been lobbying hard to keep the site open. In December, 
DOE successfully sought out industrial partners to help support the center's 
continued operation. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're happy to hear this announcement, because there was concern that time 
was running out," said John Slifko, special assistant for technology policy to 
Rep. Howard L. Berman (D-Panorama City). "We still think that a focus on 
transportation technologies is a premiere use of the site, and we will be 
working to get DOE's additional support." 
</P>
<P>
 But so far plans focus on development of the new electricity-generation 
process, Robert LeChevalier, DOE site manager, said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a really significant event," LeChevalier said. "It's the first new 
thermodynamic cycle that's been invented since 1895." 
</P>
<P>
 The new concept was devised by Alexander Kalina, an engineer from the former 
Soviet Union now living in Northern California. Potentially it could use almost 
any heat source -- fueled by natural gas, coal or geothermal or solar energy -- 
to produce electricity 20% more efficiently than current turbine technology. 
</P>
<P>
 An improvement of this magnitude could mean billions of dollars in energy 
savings in this country and internationally. The the technology center has the 
world's sole operating model of the device. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've demonstrated the principles of the cycle," LeChevalier said, "and a 
number of large utility suppliers are very interested . . . one is General 
Electric." 
</P>
<P>
 The center also has projects in renewable technologies, energy conservation 
and earthquake-effects testing. Researchers there can test the effects of 
seismic events on the parts used to buffer buildings against earthquake, or 
utility structures such as pipe systems in power plants.

 Mortgage Rates Climb Sharply: Thirty-year, fixed-rate mortgages averaged 8.47% 
this week, up from 8.04% last week, and the highest in nearly two years.The 
figures are based on a national survey by the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. 
This week's level is the highest since mortgages averaged 8.48% during the week 
ended June 26, 1992. It is nearly 1 3/4 percentage points above the 25-year low 
of 6.74% last October. On one-year adjustable-rate mortgages, lenders were 
asking an average initial rate of 4.96%, up from 4.65% last week. Fifteen-year 
mortgages averaged 7.91% this week, up from 7.55% a week earlier.

GREENSPAN SEES EVENTUAL CLOSE OF GAP IN WORKERS' INCOMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The increased importance of technology in the workplace has resulted in a 
greater gap in workers' incomes, which has left Americans with a gloomy view of 
their economic future, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 But the nation's central bank chief said the rapid technological change that 
created the gap would eventually close it, by making less-skilled workers more 
productive. 
</P>
<P>
 "All such changes in the structure of the economy naturally create frictions 
and human stress, at least temporarily," he said. "But the optimism that has 
characterized Americans through the generations will again become predominant." 
</P>
<P>
 Greenspan avoided any discussion of interest rates or the stock market's 
recent gyrations in his address to the annual conference of the six-state San 
Francisco Federal Reserve district. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, he gave a long-range and generally upbeat assessment of the U.S. 
economy -- but said polling data shows the public doesn't share his optimism. 
</P>
<P>
 "There seemingly inexplicably remains an extraordinarily deep-rooted 
foreboding" about the future, Greenspan said. "Half those polled expect the 
next generation will face lower living standards." 
</P>
<P>
 The basis for the gloomy outlook appears to be the income gap between rich and 
poor, which has widened in the last 20 years after narrowing for several 
decades before that, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The growing role of information and computers has put a premium on education, 
widening the gap between those with more schooling and those with less. But the 
same technology should eventually produce more equality, he said.

 Money Supply Mixed: The Federal Reserve Board reported that the measure of the 
nation's money supply know as M2 rose in the week ended March 28 to a 
seasonally adjusted $3,586.2 billion, up $100 million from a revised $3,586.1 
billion the week before.A broader measure, M3, fell $4.3 billion to $4,212.0 
billion from $4,216.3 billion. The narrowest measure, M1, rose $3.2 billion to 
$1,146.4 billion from $1,143.2 billion. M1 includes cash in circulation, 
deposits in checking accounts and non-bank traveler's checks. M2 is M1 plus 
accounts like savings deposits and money-market mutual funds. M3 is M2 plus 
less-liquid accounts, such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations 
of $100,000.

NEW YORK TIMES NAMES 2 TOP EDITORS; NEWSPAPERS: PULITZER WINNER JOSEPH LELYVELD 
BECOMES EXECUTIVE EDITOR, WITH EUGENE L. ROBERTS AS MANAGING EDITOR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS B. ROSENSTIEL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The New York Times announced the appointment of a new executive editor 
Thursday and the return to its ranks of one of the nation's more prominent 
journalists. 
</P>
<P>
 Joseph Lelyveld, a Pulitzer Prize winner who has been the paper's managing 
editor for four years, will become executive editor on July 1. Returning to the 
Times as managing editor will be Eugene L. Roberts Jr., 61, who left the paper 
two decades ago to win honors during 18 years as executive editor of the 
Philadelphia Inquirer. 
</P>
<P>
 Lelyveld, 57, succeeds Max Frankel, who will write a column about the media 
for the New York Times magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 Lelyveld's ascension, which comes a few months ahead of Frankel's reaching the 
mandatory retirement age of 65, did not surprise industry observers. But the 
return of Roberts was unexpected. 
</P>
<P>
 " Stunning is the word around here," said one of the newspaper's top editors. 
</P>
<P>
 "Gene changes the chemistry, the leadership," Lelyveld said in an interview. 
"It gives a sense of a new regime. It is surprising, electrifying, and I like 
that bounce, that pop." 
</P>
<P>
 Roberts joins the newspaper at a time of considerable financial stress, 
generational change and editorial experimentation. The paper is giving some of 
its writers unprecedented freedom to express their own narrative voices. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to send that sense of commitment to basic news values," Lelyveld 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Alex Jones, a former media critic for the New York Times, agreed that the 
change is significant. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it is going to be a way of marrying the new journalism that the Times 
is trying to find its way through with the best of the Times traditions of 
straightforward, hard-hitting reporting," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lelyveld and Roberts are personally close. In an internal letter to members of 
the New York Times staff, Lelyveld described Roberts as "a mentor." 
</P>
<P>
 Sources said Frankel's early departure was motivated in part by his concern 
that internal speculation and politicking about the coming changes was harmful. 
At an emotional meeting Thursday, Frankel compared editing the newspaper to 
running a relay race. What matters most, he said, is passing the baton in full 
stride. 
</P>
<P>
 Frankel also was said to have become weary of budget battles in an era of 
declining profits. Last year, the New York Times Co., which also owns other 
publications, earned a relatively meager profit of $6 million on revenue of $2 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Frankel, who immigrated from Germany, served as the paper's Washington bureau 
chief and editorial page editor before becoming executive editor. His eight 
years at the helm were marked by unexpected experimentation and new freedom in 
the newsroom. 
</P>
<P>
 Amid a recession, Frankel's New York Times revamped its sports and 
metropolitan sections and Sunday magazine and attempted to reorient the paper 
toward local and younger readers. 
</P>
<P>
 Lelyveld, who is said to have a large appetite for experimentation, began his 
New York Times career in 1962. He has served as foreign editor and has held a 
wide range of assignments. He won the Pulitzer Prize in 1986 for his book about 
apartheid in South Africa, "Move Your Shadow." 
</P>
<P>
 Roberts is considered a champion of investigative reporting. During his 18 
years at the Inquirer, that paper won 17 Pulitzer Prizes and overtook and 
eventually vanquished the larger Philadelphia Bulletin.

DOW POSTS A THIRD RISE; YIELDS EASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Staff and Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Stocks gained for a third straight day Thursday, as the bond market's tone 
improved further. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow Jones industrials rose 13.53 points to 3,693.26, and the broad market 
also looked better: Winners outnumbered losers by a healthy 9 to 5 on the New 
York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 Most other stock indexes showed bigger percentage gains than the Dow, as 
bargain hunters continued to ease back into the market. 
</P>
<P>
 The Russell 2,000 index of smaller stocks advanced 0.6%, rising 1.42 points to 
255.95. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Tuesday, the Dow has risen nearly 100 points, after plummeting more than 
200 points in six out of seven previous trading sessions -- a reaction to a 
surge in interest rates and fears the economy was growing too rapidly. 
</P>
<P>
 Traders said the bond market's relative calm over the last few days, which has 
allowed interest rates to slip, has given stock investors more incentive to 
return to the market. 
</P>
<P>
 Bond yields were marginally lower Thursday, although new reports showed 
economic strength. 
</P>
<P>
 The government said American businesses plan to increase their investment in 
new buildings and equipment by 8% this year -- the biggest rise since 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, major retailers on Thursday reported double-digit sales gains in March. 
</P>
<P>
 If some bond investors viewed those reports as more omens of rising inflation, 
they were outnumbered Thursday by buyers who apparently believe the recent 
surge in interest rates has been overdone. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm saying the bulk of the selloff is done with, and you should be looking" 
to buy bonds, said Roger Marshall, president of Riggs Investment Management. 
Marshall, who manages about $2 billion in bonds, was bullish for the first time 
in six months. 
</P>
<P>
 The yield on 30-year Treasury bonds eased to 7.20% Thursday from 7.24% 
Wednesday. Shorter-term yields also ratcheted downward. 
</P>
<P>
 The bond market may have been relieved that Federal Reserve Chairman Alan 
Greenspan didn't deliver a hawkish speech on interest rates Thursday, as had 
been rumored early in the day. 
</P>
<P>
 Greenspan, speaking in San Francisco, expressed no inflation worry and did not 
refer to interest rates directly. Some analysts said that may indicate the Fed 
is willing to sit tight for now, since raising short-term interest rates twice 
in the first quarter in an attempt to slow the economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Eugene Peroni, technical analyst at Janney Montgomery Scott, said the recent 
losses in stocks had placed some shares in a position to rebound sharply on 
good first-quarter earnings reports this month. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we are forming a bottom, not one that is major, but one that would 
endure for the next three to five weeks," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Thursday's highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Technology stocks were broadly higher, helped by a strong quarterly earnings 
report from computer workstation maker Sun Microsystems. Sun shares soared 3 
1/8 to 25 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
 Other tech winners included Hewlett-Packard, up 2 1/4 to 83 3/4; Intel, up 1 
to 70 5/8; AST Research, up 2 1/4 to 21 3/4; and Dell Computer, up 1 3/8 to 29. 
Western Digital, which also reported strong earnings, surged 1 1/4 to 19 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
 * Many retail stocks gained on their March sales reports. Gap soared 2 1/4 to 
49; Toys R Us jumped 1 1/2 to 35 7/8; Nordstrom leaped 1 3/4 to 44 1/4; Dillard 
surged 2 1/4 to 35 3/4 and Dayton Hudson was up 1 5/8 to 78 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
 But electronics retailer Tandy Corp. collapsed 3 5/8 to 32 1/2 on a 
disappointing sales report. 
</P>
<P>
 * Industrial stocks were mixed. AlliedSignal fell 1 to 36 1/8 and 
International Paper fell 1 to 66 1/8. Du Pont gained 1 1/8 to 55 1/4; GM leaped 
1 3/8 to 60 1/8; Parker-Hannifin surged 1 3/4 to 38 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
 * Some financial issues rebounded as interest rates eased. Chemical Banking 
gained 1 5/8 to 38; BankAmerica surged 1 1/2 to 41 3/8; First Chicago was up 1 
1/2 to 49 3/4 and NationsBank rose 1 1/2 to 47 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
 * Some casino stocks bounced back from a dive Wednesday, when Missouri voters 
rejected a referendum that would have allowed slot machines in the state's 
casinos. Caesars World soared 3 1/4 to 48 1/2; Circus Circus shot up 1 5/8 to 
32 3/8; Hilton gained 2 1/8 to 60. But Argosy Gaming slipped 1/4 to 19 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
 Overseas, foreign stocks closed mostly higher again. Tokyo's Nikkei index 
closed up 194.24 points at 19,890.98. In Frankfurt, the DAX index ended 10.21 
points higher at 2,201.41. But London's FTSE-100 index eased 2.5 points to 
3,129.0. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexico City's Bolsa index ended 12.81 points higher at 2,273.33. 
</P>
<P>
 In other markets, gold fell $1 to $384.90 an ounce, and silver retreated 5.2 
cents to $4.45 an ounce on the New York Comex. The dollar finished narrowly 
mixed. 
</P>
<P>
 In commodity markets, cotton rose on an unsubstantiated rumor that China had 
bought a large amount of U.S. cotton to supply its booming textile industry. 
July-delivery cotton rose 0.42 cent to 77.47 cents a pound.

TEAMSTERS TRAVELING A ROUGH, NARROW ROAD; TRUCKING: ONE OF DEREGULATION'S 
EFFECTS ON THE UNION IS 30,000 INDEPENDENT CARRIERS THAT ARE TAKING AWAY 
BUSINESS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK SWOBODA, WASHINGTON POST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A lot has happened in the trucking industry since Life magazine warned its 
readers in the spring of 1959 that if Teamster President Jimmy Hoffa wanted to, 
he could "bring a major portion of U.S. transportation -- and thus the entire 
economy -- to a halt." 
</P>
<P>
 With almost 90% of the nation's intercity trucks operating under Teamster 
contracts 35 years ago, the 1.6 million-member union had the power to choke off 
freight shipments almost anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Not anymore. Hoffa is gone, no one is quite sure where, and the union is now 
in the hands of reformers struggling to overcome his legacy. But more important 
for those Teamsters -- less than 10% of the membership -- who earn their living 
behind the wheel, the trucking industry has been deregulated. 
</P>
<P>
 As in the case of airline deregulation, the end of government restrictions on 
trucking competition in 1980 has been devastating for the union. The Teamsters 
have lost more than 100,000 members in the industry and the shrinkage 
continues. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the end of regulation more than 30,000 independent carriers have swelled 
the competitive ranks of the industry. 
</P>
<P>
 When Teamster President Ron Carey called a strike at midnight Tuesday against 
the 22 companies covered by the union's national master freight agreement, the 
public hardly noticed. 
</P>
<P>
 The master freight agreement covers what are known in the industry as 
"less-than-truckload" shipments, those weighing less than 10,000 pounds. Most 
of the shipments are parts used in manufacturing and other non-perishable raw 
materials. 
</P>
<P>
 The union has $15 million in its strike fund, which pays benefits of $200 a 
week, and has secured lines of credit for $80 million from the AFL-CIO and the 
Union Labor Life Insurance Co. 
</P>
<P>
 Like unions in the airline, auto, steel and other industries, the Teamsters 
face the prospect of fewer jobs and a lower standard of living because of 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, when the Interstate Commerce Commission determined routes, a 
trucking company did not have to fear cheaper competition entering its area. 
</P>

 Today, in a parallel to the airline industry, the unionized segment of the 
trucking industry is being overpowered by competition from small, non-union 
carriers unburdened by the work rules that can weigh down a labor contract.

DEAL COULD PUT SOME UNION DRIVERS BACK IN TRUCK CABS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A strike by at least 75,000 Teamster drivers and dock workers kept 22 trucking 
companies across the nation shut down for a second day Thursday, and no further 
contract negotiations were scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
 The Teamsters, torn recently by bitter internal feuding on other union issues, 
maintained a united front on the strike, keeping all the trucking companies' 
facilities closed from coast to coast. 
</P>
<P>
 In a move that could enable as many as 13,000 of the strikers to return to 
work, however, union leaders were expected to decide today whether to negotiate 
interim agreements with 17 of the smaller trucking companies. 
</P>
<P>
 Those companies -- many of them financially troubled -- were freed Wednesday 
by Trucking Management Inc. (TMI), the negotiating arm for the 22 employers, to 
cut deals to keep them operating. They would be obligated, however, to accept 
whatever master freight contract the five other firms eventually make with the 
Teamsters. The five are Yellow Freight Systems, Consolidated Freightways, 
Roadway Express, Churchill Truck Lines and ABF Freight System. 
</P>
<P>
 With negotiations suspended a second day, the Teamsters and TMI resorted to 
hurling barbs at each other. TMI spokesman Sam Wang said the union 
representatives "still refuse to discuss the key elements of our proposals," 
among them the addition of lower-paid, part-time workers and elimination of the 
union's right to strike over unresolved grievances. 
</P>
<P>
 "Until they are going to discuss those (contract proposals), there's not much 
to talk about," Wang said. 
</P>
<P>
 The reply, from Teamsters' spokeswoman Gaye Williams: "TMI has not shown any 
interest in negotiating, and here we are." 
</P>
<P>
 Although analysts say some retailers and manufacturers could be squeezed 
within a week by a shortage of goods due to the strike, many companies reported 
Thursday that they have made contingency plans to avoid immediate shortages. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we're forced to, we can go to other modes of transportation. . . . At this 
point, we don't see (the strike) having any meaningful consequences for us," 
said a spokesman for Kmart.

 * Audio: Time Warner AudioBooks said Thursday it has purchased the audio 
rights to Batman, Han Solo and Henry Rollins. The 10-month-old joint venture of 
the Atlantic Group and Time Warner Trade Publishing is pursuing plans to 
produce audio programming in a variety of genres. 
</P>
<P>
 A contract with Lucasfilm will see the spoken-word release of the "Star Wars" 
trilogy and audio comics based on two of Lucasfilm's "Dark Horse" comic book 
lines. TWAB will time the release this June of its audio "Wyatt Earp" to 
coincide with the Warner Bros. film starring Kevin Costner and the Warner Books 
paperback novel. 
</P>
<P>
 TWAB's audio and Warner Books' mass market paperback novelization will be 
released simultaneously with the picture's theatrical opening. In April, TWAB 
released the storybook and tape of the Don Bluth film "Thumbelina," which is 
being distributed by Warner Bros. "Black Beauty" will be available in July. 
</P>
<P>
 TWAB has also acquired the North American audio rights to the DC Comics 
characters Batman and Superman. In July, TWAB will release "Batman: The 
Complete Knightfall Saga," a full-cast audio adventure based on the 
record-breaking story line in DC's Batman Comics. 
</P>
<P>
 The program will be produced under license with the BBC in England by 
award-winning producer Dirk Maggs in Dolby Surround Sound. "Superman Lives!" 
also produced by Maggs, will be available for the first time in video and music 
stores in July. 
</P>
<P>
 For hard-core fans, former Black Flag member Henry Rollins' account of life on 
the road with the band is to be released on CD and audiocassette in August. On 
the more traditional book side of the business, TWAB will produce audio 
versions of the cyberpunk bible "Neuromancer," with author William Gibson, and 
Philip K. Dick's "Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?" the story that served 
as the basis for the hit film "Bladerunner." AMY HARMON

MALONE EXPECTS VIACOM'S DEBT TO DERAIL BLOCKBUSTER MERGER PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN LIPPMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Cable TV magnate John C. Malone on Thursday claimed that the proposed merger 
between Viacom Inc. and Blockbuster Entertainment appears to be "dead," and 
that Viacom is now looking at selling certain key assets to help pay off the 
hefty debt it took on in its acquisition of Paramount Communications. 
</P>
<P>
 "Blockbuster looks dead," Malone said following a speech he gave here to 
business leaders after his company, Tele-Communications Inc., marked the 
opening of its high-tech National Digital Television Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Malone was responding to questions about TCI's reported conversations with 
Viacom about the two companies pooling their cable TV assets in certain 
markets. The transaction, which could include long-term agreements for TCI 
cable systems to carry Viacom-owned networks like MTV and Showtime, is valued 
at about $2.2-billion. 
</P>
<P>
 A deal between TCI and Viacom, however, appears contingent on the two 
companies resolving the differences raised in Viacom's still pending antitrust 
suit against TCI, which was filed in the heat of the Paramount takeover battle. 
</P>
<P>
 Malone said Viacom approached TCI about settling the lawsuit. "They approached 
us about not burying the hatchet in our backs," Malone said. "They need help 
because they are overleveraged." 
</P>
<P>
 Malone added that Viacom is an important program supplier to TCI's 14 million 
cable subscribers and that TCI is a valuable customer. Viacom Chairman Sumner 
Redstone, Malone noted, "needs good relationships with us. . . . I would expect 
we will arrive at some rational solution." 
</P>
<P>
 Viacom could not be reached for comment on Malone's remarks.

THE BIZ / ALAN CITRON: HOLLYWOOD SEES NO DRAMA IN 'GREEN PAPER' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN CITRON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hollywood's response on Thursday to the long-awaited release of the European 
Union "Green Paper" on audiovisual policy was dramatically undramatic by 
community standards. There was little gnashing of teeth or doomsday 
prognosticating . . . even from the industry's former Chicken Little, Motion 
Picture Assn. of America President Jack Valenti. 
</P>
<P>
 That may reflect a new cautiousness in dealing with the sensitive trade issue, 
especially in public. Or it may reflect the belief that the long-range 
significance of the report will be minimal -- because its proposals are 
expected to be vigorously debated before action is taken. 
</P>
<P>
 The Green Paper was formally presented at a Brussels press conference 
Thursday, after leaking out late Wednesday. It contained many of the expected 
anti-American recommendations, with the EU commissioners calling for tougher 
quotas and subsidies on Hollywood-based productions as a way to help stimulate 
Europe's troubled entertainment industries. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the specific recommendations: stricter enforcement of rules requiring 
that 50% of all television broadcasts in Europe be of European origin and 
"parafiscal" levies on items such as cinema tickets, television advertising 
revenues and video rentals as a way to raise money for indigenous production. 
Speaking at the press conference, EU Commission President Jacques Delors said 
the issue goes to the heart of Europe's self-image. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cultural goods are the expression of the identity of each people, the vehicle 
for their language, of their history, of their heritage and their artistic 
patrimony," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Audiovisual Commissioner Joao de Deus Pinheiro, who also was on hand, called 
for "urgent action" to help Europeans prepare for the digital revolution that 
will create demand for new programs. According to wire service accounts of the 
event, Pinheiro criticized the current trade imbalance, in which European 
audiovisual exports to the United States equal $200 million, compared with more 
than $4 billion in imports from the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 That imbalance has been magnified in importance since entertainment was 
excluded from the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade last year, and it 
threatens to spill over to next month's Cannes Film Festival, where there's a 
suspicious lack of American commitment so far. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time of the GATT defeat, Valenti predicted dire consequences for 
Hollywood. But Thursday he was more optimistic. The longtime movie industry 
lobbyist, who has been meeting with European leaders over ways to resolve their 
differences, said the Green Paper actually omits some earlier "Draconian 
suggestions." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's saying, 'How does the EU go into the future and nourish thriving film 
and TV industries?' " Valenti said. "And that's what we are about now. We're 
trying to put (GATT) behind us and see how can we help build healthy industries 
in Europe, because a healthy industry is good for us, too." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Not everyone shared Valenti's sunny assessment of the report. Privately, some 
Hollywood executives said they fear that the recommendations could 
significantly reduce the flow of American entertainment to European shores. 
</P>
<P>
 That's a serious issue, since Hollywood has come to rely on overseas markets 
for roughly 50% of its theatrical revenue alone. 
</P>
<P>
 Others charged that the commission's recommendations are ill-conceived, and 
destined to fail in reviving interest in European film and TV productions. 
</P>
<P>
 "The suggestion of higher levies on the business to support (unpopular 
European movies) is neither healthy nor useful," said George Vradenburg, 
executive vice president of Fox Inc. "The efforts to harden the quotas is 
particularly troubling." 
</P>
<P>
 Jonas Rosenfield, president of the American Film Marketing Assn., said he was 
expecting a more substantive evaluation of the European entertainment 
industry's current policies and problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're saying time is running out, and that they only have 10 years to 
reverse the situation," Rosenfield said. "But there's no real input on why 
they're in such dire circumstances." 
</P>
<P>
 The Green Paper is supposed to form the basis for discussion of specific 
commission proposals due this fall. The EU's 12 member states will then approve 
a specific set of rules. 
</P>
<P>

 Remembering Wells: A ceremony honoring the late Walt Disney Co. President 
Frank G. Wells will be held at the company's Burbank headquarters at 4 p.m. 
Monday, and will be broadcast live to employees at Disneyland and Disney World. 
In addition, Disney's Burbank-Glendale offices will be closed Monday in memory 
of Wells, who was killed in a helicopter accident Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 In a prepared statement, Disney Chairman Michael D. Eisner said: "Frank's 
death was a shock to us all. We will never forget his wisdom, his awesome 
intelligence, his fiery competitiveness, his zest for life and the many lessons 
he left as a legacy to us all." 
</P>
<P>
 The Wells family has requested that all donations in his memory be made to 
Environment Now, which is dedicated to environmental restoration and 
protection. The address of Environment Now is 450 Newport Center Drive, Suite 
450, Newport Beach, CA 92660.

STILL IN TOPS FORM, BUT IT'S NOT THE SAME OLD SONG; POP MUSIC: DESPITE A 
41-YEAR PAST, LEVI STUBBS AND HIS BAND MATES, WHO PLAY THIS WEEKEND IN 
CERRITOS, LOOK TO THE FUTURE.

<P>
 The voice is that of a man in untold torment, pleading for relief even as he 
helplessly surrenders to his pain. The huge, booming baritone swoops and soars, 
melisma milking every syllable, terrifying bursts of half-shouted Angst weeping 
from the words like blood from an open wound. 
</P>
<P>
 Levi Stubbs, lead singer with the Four Tops, stood apart from most of his 
Motown label mates in the '60s. While the label featured such funky anomalies 
as the Contours and Junior Walker, Motown remains best known for producing 
slick, professional records by such Vegas-ready acts as the Supremes, the 
Temptations and the Miracles. 
</P>
<P>
 But while the Four Tops, who appear Friday and Saturday night in Cerritos, 
were one of Motown's top hit-makers during the storied label's heyday, Stubb's 
melodramatic, pleading vocals came closer to the joyful noise produced by the 
Swan Silvertones, the Soul Stirrers and the Mighty Clouds of Joy -- gospel 
groups Stubbs listened to as a teen-ager. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, I'm rather loud and raw," Stubbs acknowledged in a recent phone 
interview from his home in Detroit. "I don't really even have a style; I just 
come by the way I sing naturally. 
</P>
<P>
 "I listened to everyone from Jackie Wilson to the Soul Stirrers back then, 
because everybody had something to offer. But I just do what I do. When I learn 
a song, I try to live it as best I can. But my sound has always been raw, 
there's no question about that." 
</P>
<P>
 This year the group is celebrating its 41st anniversary -- that's 41 years 
without a single breakup or personnel change. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Stubbs formed the group with childhood buddies Renaldo Benson, Abdul 
Fakir and Lawrence Payton in 1953, they've stayed together through good times 
and bad. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's been some rough spots because we're four different individuals and 
we're all grown men," said Stubbs, 57. "But the proof is in the pudding that 
we're still here. I'm sure that if we got to the point where we couldn't be 
around each other, then we wouldn't be. 
</P>
<P>
 "But we don't have that kind of a group. We grew up together, and we've been 
friends all our lives," he said. "I've been with the Tops longer than I've been 
with my family, and that's a long, long time." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed. His marriage has lasted 34 years, he has five children, and he's never 
moved from his native Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is my home," he said. "My mom and dad are buried here. I guess I'm just 
a sentimental old guy like that. All my nephews and nieces and grandchildren 
live here, too. Detroit's been good to me, and I've never seen any reason to 
leave."  
</P>
<P>
 Stubbs and company began singing together as the Four Aims, a jazz vocal 
quartet that backed the likes of Billy Eckstine, Count Basie and Della Reese. 
They also recorded a handful of singles on their own for the Chess, Red Top and 
Columbia labels, albeit without much commercial success. The group became the 
Four Tops in 1956 to avoid being confused with the then-popular country group, 
the Ames Brothers. 
</P>
<P>
 Signed to Motown in 1963, the Tops hit the following year with "Baby I Need 
Your Loving," and in '65 with the chart-topping "I Can't Help Myself," cheery 
pop-soul numbers that characterized the group's early output. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the Same Old Song" and "Shake, Wake Me (When It's Over)" followed in the 
same vein, before the revolutionary single that forever altered the group's 
sound was released in 1966. 
</P>
<P>
 "Reach Out I'll Be There" was a minor-key, soul-searing masterpiece featuring 
a strange and unique blend of flutes, oboes and Arabic percussion, with Stubbs' 
hauntingly impassioned lead vocal in full cry. 
</P>
<P>
 It topped the charts in the U.S. and Britain for two and three weeks 
respectively, this during the heyday of British rock. 
</P>
<P>
 A series of similar-sounding singles designed to capitalize on the success of 
"Reach Out" followed, but if the attempt to cash in was obvious, such songs as 
"Standing in the Shadows of Love," "7 Rooms of Gloom" and, particularly, the 
almost frighteningly intense "Bernadette," were no mere knock-offs. Each 
release was a highly musical mini-drama that showcased Stubbs' fervent brand of 
soul shouting to great effect. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tops remained a hit-producing attraction for Motown into the next decade, 
but by 1973 it was time to move on. 
</P>
<P>
 "Motown had such a terrific roster, it was getting rather difficult to (stand 
out)," said Stubbs. Leaving the label that brought them fame, the Four Tops 
signed with ABC Records. 
</P>
<P>
 The early '70s were almost as fruitful as the Motown era for the Tops, who 
adapted their sound to keep up with the smoother grooves of vocals groups like 
the Chi-Lites, the Spinners and the O'Jays. "Keeper of the Castle," "Ain't No 
Woman (Like the One I've Got)" and "Are You Man Enough" all scored Top 20 hits 
for the veteran quartet. 
</P>
<P>
 But in recent years, the Four Tops have been mostly playing the oldies 
circuit, as changing tastes have left their brand of vocal excellence a relic 
of a bygone time in R & B history. 
</P>
<P>
 Too, Stubbs has kept busy with voice work in movies and television, including 
his celebrated performance as the voice of the man-eating plant, Audrey II, in 
the 1986 film "Little Shop of Horrors." 
</P>
<P>
 The Four Tops' induction into the Rock And Roll Hall of Fame in 1990 would 
have helped to soothe many a performer's bruised ego, but Stubbs harbors no 
sense of abandonment, nor does he indulge in nostalgia for the old days. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not concerned with any of that, the accolades or the past," he said. "You 
do what you do, and you do the best you can. I've been very fortunate in my 
career, and I'll live with that." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps Stubbs has good reason not to look backward, as he revealed future 
plans which, with a bit of luck, could bring things full circle for the Four 
Tops. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're about to sign back up with Motown," he said. "We've got Norman 
Whitfield (writer-producer of many of Motown's biggest hits) working with us. 
He's got some absolutely terrific stuff. We're still going to be the Tops and 
do what we do best, but it'll be newer material. We're going to try to produce 
hit records again." 
</P>
<P>
 * The Four Tops and the Fifth Dimension appear tonight and Saturday at 8 p.m. 
at the Cerritos Center for the Performing Arts, 12700 Center Court Drive, 
Cerritos. $30 to $42. (310) 916-8500.

 Harry Truman's idea of heaven was "a good, comfortable armchair and a good 
reading lamp and a stack of new history and biography that he wanted to read," 
said David McCullough, author of "Truman," a fat best-selling biography of the 
nation's 33rd President. 
</P>
<P>
 McCullough didn't say it to Letterman. He didn't say it to Leno. He didn't say 
it to Arsenio. He didn't say it to Oprah or Sally Jessy Raphael or Regis and 
Kathie Lee. 
</P>
<P>
 As if they'd care in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
 He said it to Brian P. Lamb. 
</P>
<P>
 Lamb is not only chairman and chief executive officer of C-SPAN but also host 
of C-SPAN's "Booknotes," television's only regular weekly national program 
devoted to authors and their books. The series marks its fifth birthday Sunday 
with a two-hour retrospective featuring excerpts from past shows and brief 
blurbs from Lamb, producer Sarah Trahern, authors and others. Expect the usual 
testimonials, all of them deserved. 
</P>
<P>
 Like a good book on a rainy day, Lamb's program is a seductive hour of 
television that you can't put down. It airs at 5 and 8 p.m. Sundays. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The focus is nonfiction. The authors have ranged from lofty historian Daniel 
Boorstin to earthy ex-school principal Madeline Cartwright, the political tome 
from former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher on the hard right to 
British-born Christopher Hitchens, a self-proclaimed "extreme leftist" who 
rarely has access to mainstream television. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Hitchens and the young Bill Clinton attended Oxford University 
simultaneously, their paths never crossed, convincing Hitchens that the 
President was, indeed, the college moderate he claimed to have been. "If he was 
a radical, I would have known him," Hitchens told Lamb. 
</P>
<P>
 You'd think that coupling serious books and television would produce an 
oxymoronic hybrid. Usually the only books that get touted on TV are trendy 
psychobabble or the ghost-written tell-all tomes of Hollywood's rickety and 
defamed. Yet these "Booknotes" interviews with authors -- usually taped at 
C-SPAN's Washington, D.C. studios with Lamb facing each subject against a 
pitch-black background -- have a casual intimacy that fits the smallness of 
television. And they can be fascinating, tracing the threads of history while 
drawing you into a heady universe of words. 
</P>
<P>
 You frequently discover as much about the authors as their books. For example, 
when that positive thinker Cartwright ("For the Children") learned that her 
unmarried college-freshman daughter was pregnant, did she let it get her down? 
No, sir, she told Lamb, recalling her message to her husband at the time: "For 
the same money, everybody got 15 credits. We got 15 credits and a rascal 
(child). Let's take that rascal and go home with it." 
</P>
<P>
 So they did. The daughter returned to class, Cartwright to her elementary 
school -- toting her 2-month-old grandson to the office. 
</P>
<P>
 Lamb is especially absorbed by the process of writing. To Hitchens ("For the 
Sake of Argument"): "Where do you write?" 
</P>
<P>
 Hitchens: "I write on a table, alone, in longhand." 
</P>
<P>
 To David Halberstam ("The Fifties"): "Where do you write?" 
</P>
<P>
 In a room that he regards almost as a dungeon, Halberstam replies. "The 
pressure of writing and being in that room is so great that when it's over, I 
don't want to be in that room." Halberstam's joy is research: "Five hours in 
the library. It's such an adventure. It's like eating salted peanuts. You never 
know what you're going to get next." 
</P>
<P>
 The amazing thing about Lamb -- and this is something so bizarre, so 
outrageous, so against type for TV interviewers that you won't believe it -- is 
that he's always reads the book of the author he's interviewing. 
</P>
<P>
 No wonder, then, that his questions are so precise. To Chief Justice William 
H. Rehnquist ("Grand Inquests"): "What do you look for in a lawyer? And do you 
ever see justices ridiculing them? And if you do, what do you do about it?" 
</P>
<P>
 Just as often Lamb elicits a response merely by reading a quote from the work. 
</P>
<P>
 To Halberstam: " 'Bigots, racists, reactionaries and sheer buffoons.' Who were 
you talking about?" 
</P>
<P>
 To Peggy Noonan ("What I Saw at the Revolution"): "You write in the middle of 
your second epilogue at the back, 'Don't fall in love with politicians; they 
are all a disappointment -- they can't help it, they just are.' What did you 
mean?" 
</P>
<P>
 To Lewis H. Lapham ("The Wish for Kings"): " 'The television and publishing 
media awarded Alan Dershowitz the reputation of an incomparable trial lawyer in 
homage to his talent for publicity rather in recognition of his record in 
appeals cases, which as of the summer of 1992 stood at nine wins and 39 
losses.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the tweedy, baggy-pants, bow-tied set that one might associate with 
such a program, Lamb is utterly without pretense, casting himself almost as the 
blue collar of literati. To "Truman" author McCullough: "You write on page 949 
-- by the way, what does this thing cost?" 
</P>
<P>
 McCullough: "Thirty bucks." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Lamb's questions are sometimes so basic -- designed to make 
"Booknotes" accessible to even the lowest-brow political hack -- that you do a 
double take. When Forrest McDonald ("The American Presidency") rejected the 
mantle of "neo-rightist" and instead referred to himself as a 
"paleo-conservative," Lamb asked him what that meant. 
</P>
<P>
 "Very old," replied McDonald. 
</P>
<P>
 To an author who mentioned Lenin: "Who is Lenin?" To an author who mentioned 
red-scare demagogue Sen. Joseph McCarthy: "Who is Joe McCarthy?" You have the 
feeling that if someone mentioned Abe Lincoln, Lamb would ask who he was, too. 
</P>
<P>
 The "Booknotes" host also stands alone as someone who asks authors to explain 
their opening dedications: " 'For Len, Sara, Paul and Annie.' Who are they?" Or 
their book covers . Some of his questions also have a jolting directness. To 
Rehnquist: "What do you get from publishing these two books?" 
</P>
<P>
 Rehnquist: "You mean outside the royalties?" 
</P>
<P>
 Lamb may be the purest journalist on U.S. airwaves. Without a doubt, he has 
one of the straightest faces. Aware that "Booknotes" viewers are much less 
curious about his views than those of the authors, he maintains a refreshing 
BBC-style dispassion. The interviewer rarely reacts to the interviewee. Once 
Lamb asks a question, he's invisible until the author stops speaking and it's 
time for another question. Only rarely does unflappability give way to 
skepticism, as when Lamb pressed Hitchens about including the sainted Mother 
Teresa in his "rogues gallery" of public figures. Alluding to the title given a 
Hitchens piece about Mother Teresa allegedly cozying up to bad people and 
causes, Lamb asked with incredulity: "And you call this 'The Ghoul of 
Calcutta'?" Hitchens responded with an even broader condemnation of Mother 
Teresa, displaying the sharp tongue that gets him blacklisted. 
</P>
<P>
 "Booknotes." To some, an idea of heaven. 
</P>

 LESS HEAVENLY: Dropping all pretense of objectivity, KNBC-TV Channel 4 
anchorman Paul Moyer let loose near the end of his 11 p.m. newscast Wednesday 
and called Jim Rome a "smart-mouthed little twerp." Moyer was wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 Rome is a smart-mouthed little cretin . And come to think of it, there's 
nothing smart about him either. 
</P>
<P>
 It was smirking ESPN2 talk-show host Rome who ridiculed and taunted former 
Rams quarterback Jim Everett in front of the camera Wednesday night by 
repeatedly labeling his in-studio guest "Chris Evert," a reference to the 
female tennis great and an attack on Everett's manliness for not playing the 
game up to Dim Rome's macho standards. This was not the first time that Dim 
Rome had publicly called Everett "Chris." 
</P>
<P>
 Egged on by Dim Rome -- who is obviously more than a little low on wattage 
above the neck -- Everett finally had enough and shoved a table into Dim Rome, 
knocking him over. 
</P>
<P>
 You have to credit Dim Rome with hanging in there and taking the sack he 
accused Everett of being afraid to take, but not with much else. Although no 
punches were thrown, Dim Rome may indeed have taken a savage blow to the head, 
for later he shocked everyone by uttering a three-syllable word, saying Everett 
seemed "remorseful." 
</P>
<P>
 What does Everett have to be remorseful about except for not breaking Dim 
Rome's lips? It was Dim Rome who should have been remorseful. 
</P>
<P>
 No chance, though, because TV stations everywhere played the tape of the 
encounter, probably furthering Dim Rome's reputation as a sports guy who won't 
take "smack" from anyone, even his own guests. Why, if he had Chris Evert on 
the show, he'd probably call her "Jim." 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday night's spectacle should have gotten him fired, but instead the 
notoriety will probably give his career a big boost.

 Encouraged by the results of his first attempt at running a concert, a 
fledgling folk music promoter plans to mount a series of shows at the Rose & 
Crown British Pub & Restaurant in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 Kenneth Zwick, a Costa Mesa attorney and folk musician, took the plunge into 
promotion last month, staging concerts by the British folk duo of Steve Tilston 
and Maggie Boyle at the Anaheim Rose & Crown and its sister location in San 
Clemente. 
</P>
<P>
 The Anaheim show attracted 90 folk fans, and the San Clemente show drew 42, 
out of a capacity of 100 at each site, Zwick said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was very pleased" both with the attendance and the way the concerts went, 
Zwick said. Well aware that there is little money to be made promoting 
traditional folk music, he said he will continue doing shows to provide a 
platform for worthy performers -- and, as an indirect benefit, to gain exposure 
for his practice as an entertainment lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
 Zwick has added three more bookings in April and May. Andy M. Stewart & Gerry 
O'Beirne, a veteran Scottish-Irish duo, play two concerts on April 15.  
</P>
<P>
 Orange County bluegrass guitar ace Dan Crary performs two concerts on May 1, 
and English duo Martin and Jessica Simpson appear May 22. 
</P>
<P>
 Tickets cost $14 at the door and $12 in advance. (Prices for the Dan Crary 
shows are $12 at the door, $10 in advance, 6 and 8:15 p.m.). 
</P>
<P>
 The Rose & Crown is at 20 S. Anaheim Blvd. Information: (714) 778-5606 or

 OVER AND BACK: A concert trip to Switzerland and Holland awaits country singer 
Jann Browne this month, but she already has made her homecoming plans. Browne 
and her band will play May 6 and 7 at the Rio Grande Bar & Grill in the 
Capistrano Depot, 26701 Verdugo St., San Juan Capistrano. The second night is a 
jam night, with musical associates of Browne sitting in as guests. 
</P>
<P>
 Browne's new album, "Count Me In," will be available at the concerts. Released 
on Red Moon, a Swiss label, the record will be available here only at Browne's 
shows, at least until she is able to arrange for U.S. distribution. 
</P>
<P>
 The Laguna Hills-based singer will be keeping good company on her upcoming 
European tour. Besides Browne and her five-member band, the "Western Beat" tour 
features Costa Mesa's Chris Gaffney and his guitarist, Danny Ott, Rosie Flores, 
the Zydeco Party Band and Alan Whitney. 
</P>
<P>
 Browne said that the entire cast will appear on three festival bills; on other 
nights in the 12-day tour, the entourage will split up, with various performers 
branching off to do shows of their own in smaller venues. 
</P>
<P>
 Fans who can't stand to wait until May to hear Browne can catch her in concert 
Wednesday at the Big Stone Lodge in Poway in San Diego County.

 AIDS BENEFIT: Local rock bands Standard Fruit, Giant Ant Farm, Eli Riddle and 
Willoughby will play a benefit for the California AIDS Ride on Saturday at 8

 MASTER CLASS: After playing a concert at the Coach House on Monday with his 
band, bluegrass pioneer Ralph Stanley will stay on locally another day to host 
a banjo workshop at Shade Tree Stringed Instruments in Laguna Niguel on 
Tuesday. Appearing by himself, the 67-year-old Virginian will demonstrate 
playing techniques, answer questions and discuss his life and times. Tickets 
for the 7:30 p.m. workshop cost $30 at the door, $25 in advance. (714) 
364-5270.

FOLLOWING THE LONG, STRANGE TRIP OF 'RED ROCK'; MOVIES: THE 'COWBOY NOIR' FILM, 
WHICH HAS ROAMED FROM EUROPEAN THEATERS TO FILM FEST TO HBO TO FILM FEST TO 
VIDEO, FINALLY GETS A U.S. RELEASE. 
</P>

<P>
 If "Red Rock West" once was a tough sell, it ain't any more. 
</P>
<P>
 The celebrated movie, dubbed a "cowboy noir" by its distributors and a wicked 
black comedy by many critics, was headed to a quick fade-out on the 
movie-channel horizon until a San Francisco distribution company came to the 
rescue. 
</P>
<P>
 Roxie Releasing has resuscitated the theatrical life of "Red Rock West," which 
has gone a strange if not unprecedented course from European movie houses to 
film festival to HBO to film festival to video and now selected theaters in 
major U.S. cities, including Los Angeles' Laemmle Sunset-5. 
</P>
<P>
 And no one is more relieved than director John Dahl, who publicly bemoaned the 
fate of his $7.5-million picture starring Nicolas Cage at the first Hamptons 
International Film Festival last year, saying U.S. distributors ignored the 
film's good notices and healthy overseas box-office take. The picture, produced 
by Polygram through its subsidiary Propaganda Films, was a critical and popular 
hit in East Hampton, and earlier at the Toronto Film Festival, yet struck out 
with the usual distributors of art-house films like Miramax, Goldwyn and 
others.  
</P>
<P>
 In the film, Cage plays a drifter who is wrongly mistaken for a hit-man while 
getting tangled up in a web of larceny, deception and murder that also involves 
the intended victim, played by Lara Flynn Boyle, whom Cage falls in love with. 
The Times' Kevin Thomas, as with many other reviewers, has favorably compared 
"Red Rock's" tone and style to the Coen Bros.' "Blood Simple." 
</P>
<P>
 When reached at the Los Angeles production offices of his current film, 
"Meltdown," Dahl said: "It's satisfying that people walk away from a movie and 
then come back and see it has a second life." 
</P>
<P>
 Roxie Releasing C.E.O. Bill Banning said that in mid-January, when he wanted 
to book the picture into his Roxie Theater in San Francisco, he couldn't 
believe it didn't have a distributor, since "Red Rock West" had been one of his 
top-five favorites at the Toronto Film Festival in September. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 He also learned that Columbia TriStar Home Video, which had put up $3.5 
million of the movie's production costs, had already made a deal with HBO to 
recoup some of its money. (Dahl, in fact, recalls when making the rounds of the 
film festival circuit -- the movie also was shown at World Festival Charleston 
(S.C.) and the Virginia Film Festival -- how some people commented to him that 
they remembered "Red Rock West" from their cable television listings.) What 
might have further put Banning off, at about this same time Columbia was 
releasing the home-video version on a limited basis. 
</P>
<P>
 But, as Banning said he discovered, "It almost didn't matter, because this 
movie was an extreme crowd-pleaser," noting that "Red Rock West" broke the 
Roxie's house record in its fourth week, helped by raves in the local press, 
and its L.A. and N.Y. grosses aren't far behind. 
</P>
<P>
 With a relatively meager promotional and advertising budget of $100,000, Roxie 
said critics' notices and good word-of-mouth has to sell the picture. Still, 
with 20 prints struck and plans to expand to Washington, Boston, Chicago and 
elsewhere soon, he expects to break even. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'Cowboy noir' isn't a big hook, but it's a great hook to certain people. You 
really have to see it to get it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Or, as Dahl put it: "It's not 'Schindler's List,' but it's a good little 
movie. . . . As far as I'm concerned, this is just terrific."

NATIONAL VIDEO RENTALS; OSCAR MAY HAVE A LOT TO DO WITH IT 
</P>

 All of the pre-Oscar hype should really pay off in the rental market for 
"What's Love Got to Do With It," starring Laurence Fishburne and Angela 
Bassett, both of whom were Oscar-nominated for their acclaimed portrayals of 
Ike and Tina Turner. The film debuted at No. 7.It could challenge for the top 
spot, but the grim and inspirational bio-pic with music may have a tough time 
muscling past those three action movies. Mel Gibson's "The Man Without a Face" 
continues to do strong business (No. 6). The sleeper rental hit of the year so 
far, "Kalifornia," with Brad Pitt and Juliette Lewis, is still a big attraction 
in many areas, coming in nationally at No. 14. Its nine-week chart run is 
impressive for a movie that made little money in theaters. It's clearly 
word-of-mouth business. 
</P>
<P>
 * Moviegoers weren't too interested in Carl Reiner's wacky movie-genre spoof 
($7.6-million gross) but it could score as a rental because similar 
movies--"Hots Shots" and "Robin Hood: Men in Tights"--have done well on video 
recently. The audience for these twisted comedies just might be ripe for 
another one. Debuting at No. 34, "Fatal Instinct" could crack the Top 20, but 
breaking into the Top 10 isn't likely. 03,22,06,08 Rank Weeks Last on the Week

SAME TIME, SAME PLACE -- AND, YES, SAME FESTIVALS; POP MUSIC: THE TROUBADOURS 
OF MUSIC AND CRAFTS FESTIVAL IS AGAIN SCHEDULED OPPOSITE THE SOUTHERN 
CALIFORNIA CAJUN & ZYDECO FESTIVAL JUNE 4-5. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 In a repeat of what was described last year as a scheduling gaffe, two major 
folk-oriented music festivals will again take place in the Southland on the 
same weekend in June just 30 miles apart. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 50 performers of folk, country, blues and roots-based styles will 
participate in the Troubadours of Music and Crafts Festival slated for June 4-5 
at UCLA's Drake Stadium. Last year the event was called "Troubadours of Folk," 
but promoter Jim Rissmiller of Concert Associates renamed it to reflect the 
wider scope he's aiming for this year. 
</P>
<P>
 On the same two days in Long Beach, the eighth annual Southern California 
Cajun & Zydeco Festival will be held at Rainbow Lagoon in Long Beach. On the 
card are D.L. Menard & the Louisiana Aces, Steve Riley & the Mamou Playboys, 
Nathan & the Zydeco Cha-Chas, Walter Mouton & the Scott Playboys, the Poullard 
Brothers and Joe Simien & Lisa Haley. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, organizers of the folk festival said that they had been misinformed 
about the dates of the Cajun-zydeco event and that they had no intention of 
conflicting with that festival. 
</P>
<P>
 But this year, Rissmiller said that he decided to book the Troubadours 
Festival on the same weekend to maintain continuity. "I don't know if in a city 
this size you could do any event on a weekend and not have some competition," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the performers on the Troubadours schedule are the Chieftains, Joan 
Baez, Richie Havens, John Hammond, Solomon Burke, Arlo Guthrie, Riders in the 
Sky, Eric Andersen, Loudon Wainwright III, Dave Van Ronk, David Grisman and 
Kate & Anna McGarrigle, Rissmiller said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the competition factor last year, both festivals were hurt by a 
major rainstorm on the first day. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, because of the disappointing turnout, Rhino Records has withdrawn as 
a co-presenter of this year's Troubadours event. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "As with some of our other experiments, this one taught us something, and that 
is we are not in the concert-promotion business," said Ted Myers, A&R 
coordinator for the West Los Angeles-based record label. "The festival itself 
lost a significant amount of money. If it had been a big money maker, it might 
have been a different story for us." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Rissmiller, "Critically, it was a major success. Financially, it was a 
tremendous loss. But there were even radio station reports that our show had 
been canceled. . . . I think we probably would have walked off with our tail 
between our legs if it wasn't for the critical and fan reaction. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "Is it make or break time?" Rissmiller said. "If I think we've done everything 
we can do and it still isn't a success, then yes, we'll have to re-evaluate." 
</P>
<P>
 Cajun-zydeco festival organizer Franklin Zawacki said the rain and the 
scheduling conflict added up to a $40,000 loss last year, and that he is trying 
to line up additional underwriting this year. But he's less concerned about the 
head-to-head scheduling this time. 
</P>
<P>
 "My feeling is that now that Rhino has pulled out, and because of the name 
change, we won't have that same tug of war with our audience. Rhino included a 
lot of our bands and it was an unfortunate pull for patrons last year. I don't 
feel that will be true at all this year."

WHAT'S DICIER: CATTLE FUTURES OR OWNING A CLUB?; JAZZ: 'SINCE WE'VE BEEN OPEN, 
CLOSE TO A THOUSAND PLACES HAVE OPENED AND CLOSED,' SAYS DON RANDI, OWNER OF 
THE LONGEST-RUNNING CLUB IN TOWN, THE BAKED POTATO.

 Earlier this year, Nucleus Nuance on Melrose was one of Hollywood's jumping 
nightspots, offering a wide range of jazz and jazz-pop music to a devoted 
clientele. It wasn't all that unusual for musical luminaries to drop by and sit 
in with the featured performers, as Stevie Wonder did back in February. Quite 
suddenly, the club is closed. No explanations have been made public, and no 
plans to reopen have been announced. Supporters of the Los Angeles jazz/pop 
scene may feel the loss of one more venue, but it's unlikely there will be any 
tears shed. This is a feeling they've gotten used to. 
</P>
<P>
 Nucleus joined a long-running list of once-well-regarded, now departed jazz 
spots. And the list continues to grow. Nightwinds in Santa Monica suffered 
extensive damage in the January quake and will be hard-pressed to reopen. 
</P>

 "I can't keep track of club closings anymore," says Don Randi, owner of the 
two Baked Potato nightclubs. Randi's Studio City club is in its 24th year, and 
has the distinction of being the longest-running jazz room in town. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since we've been open, close to a thousand places have opened and closed," 
Randi says. 'We started in the Nixon years and made it through that. We've been 
through some terrible economic times. Every time it starts getting better, 
something happens. Just before the riots, we were enjoying a boom, and then we 
got hit with all those days of curfew that completely threw us off. And things 
were picking up from last October to this January, and then the earthquake hit 
and we had to start all over again. It always takes a year to a year and a half 
after these type of things to get your crowd coming out again." 
</P>
<P>
 The running of restaurants and nightclubs has never been an easy business. The 
outposts of any city's night life are always susceptible to public whims and 
economic fluctuations. But the jazz spots of Los Angeles are in a unique bind. 
The clubs have the finest jazz talent in the world available to them 
continually, yet it's a daily struggle to get listeners into the rooms. And, of 
course, the next temblor could put them out of business. 
</P>
<P>
 Myrna Daniels, editor and publisher of the music paper L.A. Jazz Scene, has 
been documenting the openings and closings of clubs for nearly seven years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every month we report that somebody has folded, and it's been that way since 
we started. That's exactly why the paper can't depend on club advertising. But 
there always seem to be new places opening, and the scene seems to balance out 
by the end of every year." 
</P>
<P>
 Daniels says that though this town can be tough on its jazz clubs, jazz fans 
can still track down great music if they're willing to look for it. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are always a lot of exciting things happening in Los Angeles -- special 
events, concerts, club events. But for one club to get all the right elements 
together is almost impossible. The jazz audience has to be fiercely dedicated. 
They have to follow the performers. I don't think it matters so much to the 
fans where the musicians work. The venue isn't as important as the show." 
</P>
<P>
 Some venues have weathered the shifting tides quite well. St. Mark's in Venice 
has attracted a steady crowd with it's diverse booking policy. Inn Arty's has 
done the same in Pasadena. Hollywood's Vine St. Bar & Grill remains a respected 
haven for serious jazz listeners. A few blocks away at Catalina Bar & Grill, 
patrons are so dedicated that during the week following the January earthquake, 
sell-out crowds sat quietly through the aftershocks while listening to 
saxophonist Pharaoh Sanders. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But even for successful club owners, there comes a time to say goodby to the 
scene. Al Williams has been running Birdland West in downtown Long Beach for 
seven years, and for nine years before that he ran the Jazz Safari in the 
Londontowne village next to the Queen Mary. He's currently in the process of 
selling Birdland. He's seeking an owner who will respect the club and keep it 
running, but he won't miss that responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
 "I smoked for quite a number of years too, and I woke up one morning and just 
threw the pack away and quit. I hope Birdland is around forever, but it's not 
going to be hard to walk away from the business. Seventeen years of running 
day-to-day operations in a jazz club is enough." 
</P>
<P>
 Williams says that any nightclub is going to have its ups and downs, but 
points out that the downs for a jazz club can be particularly treacherous. 
"Jazz clubs are having a tough time, and so is everybody else," he says. "But 
we don't do the same kind of numbers as a rock club. If a rock joint is down 
20%, we're down 40%." 
</P>
<P>
 Many clubs have attempted to lure a steady crowd by straying away from 
musically strict booking policies so that a wide range of sounds can be offered 
throughout the week. Studio City's La Ve Lee used to specialize in Brazilian 
jazz, but now offers everything from honky-tonk blues to hard-grooving funk. 
J.P.'s Moneytree in North Hollywood and Chadney's in Burbank offer a rich and 
varied mix of mainstream jazz acts. Club Brasserie at the Bel Age Hotel in West 
Hollywood and the Room Upstairs at Le Cafe in Sherman Oaks have become bustling 
haunts where club-hoppers mix with more serious jazz listeners. 
</P>
<P>
 For most club owners, no matter the quality and variety of the music they 
offer, it's the food and drinks they serve that keep the clubs running. Jax in 
Glendale survived as a bar and restaurant for seven years before adding jazz 
music as an added attraction five years ago. 'We're probably one of the noisier 
jazz clubs," says night manager James Colley. "There's a lot of talking while 
people are having dinner. But I think we've also cultivated a lot of jazz fans. 
They come back again and again to hear the music." 
</P>
<P>
 Bernard Jacoupy is a French-born restaurateur who decided to combine his 
passions for food and jazz when he opened Lunaria four years ago. "Making my 
restaurant a part of the jazz scene was a real plus," he says. "But the club 
wouldn't survive without serving food. It's always a struggle. We opened a 
month before the Persian Gulf crisis. From there we moved on to the riots and 
the fires and the earthquake." 
</P>
<P>
 Jacoupy says it's tough for a club to stay profitable, but says the Los 
Angeles scene is also equally tough for the people that actually make the 
music.  
</P>
<P>
 "I really feel for the musicians. It surprises me that L.A. isn't more 
supportive of its players. There are so many excellent musicians who live here, 
but it's hard for them to make a living working here. They have to travel," he 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 The Jazz Bakery in Culver City stands out as a venue that focuses on the music 
made there. The 2-year-old club is run as a nonprofit corporation under the 
guidance of Ruth Price, a veteran of the club world through her years as a 
vocalist. The room at the Bakery is set up theater-style, and the admission 
charge always includes the music, desserts, soft drinks, and parking. "No jazz 
club closing surprises me," says Price. "It surprises me that they stay open. 
There are some owners who look at the clubs as just a business. They want to 
see a certain amount of profit all the time, or they close the club. If that's 
the way we looked at what we've done down here the last 2 1/2 years, we 
wouldn't be in business either." 
</P>
<P>
 Price says that a jazz club's survival often comes down to one person's love 
of the music. "Jazz rooms in particular are almost totally dependent on a 
single person. I think of the great clubs I've known, and when you think of the 
club you think of the person behind it. When that person moves on, the club 
usually ends. It takes that kind of passion. Only one person can be that crazy. 
At the Jazz Bakery, it's me."

REDISCOVERING THAT OLD MAGIC; JAZZ: SANS THEIR LATE LEADER, A POWERHOUSE MILES 
DAVIS GROUP GETS TOGETHER FOR A TRIBUTE TOUR AND RECORDING. THE RESULTS ARE 
FINE EVEN THOUGH IT WASN'T ALL SMOOTH SAILING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Miles Davis -- jazz Trumpet Master, Prince of Darkness, the very symbol of 
improvisational adventurousness -- was listening to his new, young rhythm 
section during a performance one night and wondering what they were doing to 
set his musical antenna quivering. 
</P>
<P>
 The players were pianist Herbie Hancock, bassist Ron Carter and drummer Tony 
Williams, all still in their teens and 20s. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were moving things around," recalled Hancock of the episode that happened 
almost 30 years ago, "not just playing in standard time, doing unusual rhythms, 
with Ron playing melodies on the bass instead of the traditional bass lines." 
</P>
<P>
 The problem was that they were playing in this style behind the solos of 
George Coleman, the tenor saxophonist at the time (later replaced by Wayne 
Shorter), rather than behind Miles. 
</P>
<P>
 "So Miles turned to us," continued Hancock, "and said, in that unique, 
gravelly voice of his, 'Why don't you play like that behind me?' 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't answer, but what we thought was, 'Because you probably won't be 
able to play with it. We've heard you play in a certain way, and that's the way 
we expect you to play.' " 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course," added Hancock with a laugh, "we didn't actually say that, but 
that's what we thought, in our youthful arrogance." 
</P>
<P>
 Davis was, nonetheless, the leader of the band, so the rhythm trio gave him 
what he requested. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first day we started playing that open rhythm style behind Miles, he was 
struggling with it," said Hancock. "But he wanted more of it, and the next day 
he was better. By the third day, I was struggling with it -- but he had gotten 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 Miles got it then as he always had and as he continued to, right up until his 
death in September, 1991. The impact of his passing resonated through the jazz 
community. Controversial to the end, always open to new vistas, he assembled a 
series of groups over four decades that were almost always on the cutting edge 
of jazz. The mid-'60s group was one of the best. 
</P>
<P>
 Hancock, Shorter, Carter and Williams, who had each drifted away from the 
Davis band in the late '60s and not not worked together as a complete unit 
since the late-'70s, decided that the best way to celebrate the enigmatic 
trumpeter's extraordinary life was to reassemble for a tribute tour and 
recording. 
</P>
<P>
 The reunion seemed like a good idea at the time -- at least in principle. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But what had been a combination made in jazz heaven turned out at the start of 
the reunion, at least, to have something less than celestial interaction. 
Hancock, the initial organizing force behind the record, pushed for the group 
to go into the studio before the tour, in part because of the complications of 
his busy career. Others were less enthusiastic about recording before they had 
an opportunity to do some live performing. 
</P>
<P>
 The resulting album -- "A Tribute to Miles," released last week on Qwest 
Records -- was recorded in June, 1992, at Signet Soundworks in Los Angeles 
(with two additional tracks done "live" at a Berkeley concert in September). 
</P>
<P>
 The initial studio sessions were thorny encounters for all involved. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first day we played, it was terrible; it wasn't grooving, at all," 
recalled Hancock. 
</P>
<P>
 "Painful," added Williams. "That's what it was." 
</P>
<P>
 Williams, like Hancock, anticipated that the music would flow from the very 
beginning with the easy togetherness of the group's salad years when their work 
with Davis on albums such as "E.S.P.," "Miles Smiles," "Sorcerer," "Filles de 
Kilimanjaro" and "Miles in the Sky" resulted in a refinement of the 
stretched-out, rhythmically free-floating improvisational style that has had 
enormous impact upon the jazz of the last three decades.  
</P>
<P>
 But that was not to be the case. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem was that the remarkably intuitive interaction they had in the 
mid-'60s simply could not be recaptured on demand. As Hancock noted, years of 
individual stardom and experiences with other groups and other music had 
intervened. And it just could be that the absence of Miles had seriously 
changed the dynamic that had been so effective 30 years earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 The difficulties of rediscovering the old magic revived the disagreement over 
the wisdom of recording before the tour -- at a time when the musicians had 
barely begun to integrate with each other -- rather than later, after the 
mellowing aspects of the road had enhanced their renewed musical association. 
</P>
<P>
 "We should have waited," said Williams. "But (at the time) they were in too 
much of a hurry to put the record out." 
</P>
<P>
 Other issues emerged. An initial plan to record new compositions by each of 
the players was set aside. "It didn't seem like such a good thing to do," said 
Hancock. Instead, it was decided that numbers composed by Davis would open and 
close both the album and each performance on the tour. Tunes written by the 
members of the group would come between the signature Davis pieces. Then there 
was grumbling about which tunes would be chosen. 
</P>
<P>
 But by the fourth day of rehearsal, in part because of the integrative effect 
of the addition of trumpeter Wallace Roney, the group's only new member, things 
began to lighten up in the studio, and some of the old magic began to emerge. 
</P>
<P>
 "Wallace fit in like a hand in a glove," said Carter. "From the first 
rehearsal, it was obvious that he's one trumpet player who knows where the beat 
is." 
</P>
<P>
 The recording completed, the band took off on an international Tribute to 
Miles Tour in July, 1992, that included dates in Europe, Asia and the United 
States. Critical response was almost universally positive. But the tour also 
revived mixed memories of the '60s for most of the players. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For Carter, the remembrances were good, especially in terms of camaraderie and 
musical connectedness. "Those were the days," he said of the '60s, "when there 
were no limousines, we paid our own hotel bills, and we didn't have personal 
managers and personal agents to step between us and whatever else." 
</P>
<P>
 For him, the best aspect of the tour was the insistence of the players that 
they not be "stuck in this modern-day, mink-coated isolation in which everybody 
gets their own limousine and meets at the gig. So we'd sit in the airport 
lounge and talk about the last set, or what's the best way to program the music 
for the following night. It was the kind of environment we grew up in, and it 
was good to experience it again." 
</P>
<P>
 Hancock recalled the intensity of being in his 20s during the Davis years, and 
of working on the cutting edge with an artist who already had achieved 
legendary status. "We didn't have any concept of doing anything revolutionary 
while we were doing it," he said. "At the time, we were just playing. My 
feeling was very simple: 'Miles is a (expletive). We better come up with some 
original, unique stuff or else we will fail!' " 
</P>
<P>
 Williams' recollections of the tribute tour -- he remembered only the last two 
nights that Carter played as "something extraordinary" -- reflected his quite 
different experience with the '60s group. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was the smallest and the youngest when I joined the band," he recalled. 
"And it's been a difficult relationship for me, to one degree or another, with 
each one of them over the years. Miles was great, even though I had a few 
run-ins with him. But mostly I had to figure things out myself, because there 
was no one there, there was no one my age." 
</P>
<P>
 Shorter also saw the differences between past and present, and, in typically 
philosophical fashion, reveled in them. "Sure, it was different from what it 
was like when we were playing with Miles," he said. "Because everything that 
everyone has been doing since the '60s was showing its presence in the midst of 
our playing the songs that we had played at that other time. What we have been 
doing since then kept raising its mischievous head in there, and adding another 
kind of spice to it." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps because he was the new member in the group, perhaps because he 
participated in the tour with no past memories brought to bear, Roney had few 
complaints about the experience. The only thing that disturbed him was the 
occasional question regarding his difficult assignment to "replace" Davis in 
the ensemble. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's just critics saying that," he said with annoyance. "I think fans just 
want to hear good music. And if they're picky about anything, it's about how 
good you can play. I don't think people came into the concerts like they'd just 
made a bet about whether or not I can play like Miles." 
</P>
<P>
 The tour completed, the players expected the album to be released almost 
immediately. But delay after delay followed, due largely to the fact that four 
musicians who had been the Young Turks of jazz 30 years ago are now stars in 
their own right, with distancing layers of record companies, agents and 
managers who had something to say about almost every aspect of the release of 
the album. 
</P>
<P>
 The worst aspect of the frustrating "business difficulties," as Hancock summed 
them up, surrounding the tribute album and the tour is the bittersweet aura 
they have created around what otherwise might simply have been viewed as an 
extraordinary jazz reunion. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately, none of those feelings are apparent in the recording. Despite the 
reported musical disconnectedness of the first rehearsals, the recorded tunes 
successfully achieve a goal that all the players agreed upon: a re-examination 
of the innovative ensemble approaches of the '60s from a viewpoint that 
reflects the individual growth and maturity that have taken place in the past 
three decades. 
</P>
<P>
 "In general," said Hancock, "the musical roles we played were pretty much the 
same now as they were in the '60s. Except that in this incarnation, the roles 
are a lot more flexible from person to person. I think that's probably our 
maturity. 
</P>
<P>
 "But it's funny, because when we were young, there was a kind of flexibility 
then, too, maybe because we were too young to want to just lock ourselves into 
certain predictable roles. Now that we're older, I think we more accurately 
sense what those roles are, and are willing to give in to allowing other 
individuals to explore their own roles from moment to moment."

GEORGE CARLIN PLANS TO TEST LANGUAGE LIMITS AT FOX TV 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUDITH MICHAELSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Last week it was CBS having to bleep Madonna during her appearance on "Late 
Show With David Letterman." This week it was Fox that was dealing with similar 
language from George Carlin on his sitcom for the network. 
</P>
<P>
 In an obvious parody of his own indirect role in the so-called "seven dirty 
words" case that led to a U.S. Supreme Court ruling in 1978, the comedian was 
planning to tape an episode of "The George Carlin Show" Thursday night in which 
he would utter a four-letter synonym for sexual intercourse seven times. 
</P>
<P>
 Fox said it would delete the words before the program is broadcast April 24 in 
its usual 9:30 p.m. slot. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's our intention that viewers will neither hear nor see the actual words 
being spoken," a Fox spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The representative declined to discuss the matter further, although there was 
no indication that Fox was particularly unhappy with Carlin. "We have a very 
good relationship with George and the show," the spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the series, Carlin plays George O'Grady, an irreverent taxi driver and 
street philosopher with opinions about everything. In the episode taping 
Thursday, another cab driver provokes him by cutting him off in traffic. What 
O'Grady doesn't know is that a member of the Taxi Commission is his passenger 
and hears his invectives. O'Grady is asked to apologize but he stands on his 
right to free speech and has a dream in which he discusses the First Amendment 
with Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson and George Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 In provoking Fox to edit him, Carlin was harking back to the 1978 Supreme 
Court decision that upheld the right of the Federal Communications Commission 
to prohibit certain language at times when programming is "uniquely accessible 
to children." 
</P>
<P>
 The case stemmed from a listener complaining about a New York radio station 
having played in the afternoon a portion of a Carlin record album on which he 
talked about the seven words "you couldn't say on the public airwaves." The FCC 
reprimanded the station but the station took the matter to court. 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately the Supreme Court held that "patently offensive, indecent material 
presented over the airwaves confronts the citizen not only in public but also 
in the privacy of the home where the individual's right to be let alone plainly 
outweighs the First Amendment rights of the intruder." 
</P>
<P>
 Carlin didn't seem particularly disturbed to learn that he would be bleeped. 
"You don't come into these situations attempting to change the rules," he said 
Thursday. Comedians and networks don't have the same mandate, he said, adding, 
"it's up to the network to make the last decision."

FIDDLING AROUND WITH REVITALIZED SWEDISH TRADITION; FOLK MUSIC: THE GROUP PALLE 
NUH WILL PLAY SCHOTTICHES AND POLSKAS AT A CONCERT AND DANCE AT BALL JUNIOR 
HIGH SCHOOL IN ANAHEIM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Over the course of the past century and a half, the tradition of the Swedish 
fiddler fell victim to a triumvirate of scourges: piety, industry and 
modernity. Moralistic institutions decided that dancing was not a good idea. 
The industrial revolution replaced villages with cities. And phonographs 
squeezed live regional music out from community functions. 
</P>
<P>
 "But the tradition never really disappeared, especially in (the southern 
province of) Dalarna," explains Maria Jonsson, one of three Swedish fiddlers 
who will play a concert and dance Saturday night at Ball Junior High School in 
Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 "It just diminished, same as old fiddling in (the United States), until in the 
1970s folk music became part of popular as well as older rural culture. Then 
started spel man samma (folk festivals) where people get together to play and 
dance. People also began to visit old fiddlers, to learn and to make 
recordings." 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday, Jonsson, Carina Normansson and Ola Backstrom -- the Falun-based 
group Palle Nuh -- will play schottiches , polskas (not to be confused with 
polkas) and wedding marches from Dalarna. Jonsson also will play tunes from 
Vasterbotten; Normansson specializes in music from Vastmanland, Halsingland and 
Uppland, Normansson also sings. Backstrom is among the most-recorded Dalarna 
fiddlers. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The three also will lead fiddling workshops tonight and Saturday in 
Westminster. 
</P>
<P>
 "I first learned to play violin from my sister and in music school, but then 
from an old man in Skellestea," continued Jonsson, reached by phone upon the 
musicians' arrival in Chicago. "It wasn't actually lessons. For two or three 
years, we met and played, and I learned the tunes." 
</P>
<P>
 She then attended Malungsfolkhoskola, a folk music school, where she met her 
Chicago host, Christine Hammond, also a fiddler. Though more fluent in English, 
Hammond said it is "almost impossible" to describe what really sets this music 
apart. But she tried. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's dark a lot of the year (in Sweden), and the mood of the people changes 
very significantly with the change of light. The music is often in a minor key, 
mysterious, melancholy -- yet the people find good cheer in that. You feel the 
seasons in the music." 
</P>
<P>
 Others of a more technically analytical bent have described the music as being 
both drone-like and contrapuntal. The fiddle often is played in first position, 
such that the open strings lend it a drone quality. (There is, by the way, such 
a thing as a Swedish bagpipe.) "Spontaneous seconding," wherein one melody 
embellishes another, lends the counterpoint. Modality often switches between 
major and minor, even within the same phrase. 
</P>
<P>
 Backstrom talked about the modal tradition. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes you talk about a special scale that comes from the herding of 
cows," he said. "The grass around the village wasn't enough, so they spent the 
summer in the mountain forests. It was (far) between the (herders) and they 
would communicate with a certain kind of cow song, and play on cow horns. There 
is violin music that imitates the scale on the cow horn, and that is our oldest 
music. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "If you look at the tonal language, say before 1850, for many people it's sad. 
There's a kind of blue feeling in the older music, and sometimes you use 
microtones like the blues. We call them blue notes." 
</P>
<P>
 Before 1850? Perhaps the blues came from . . .? 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a nice thought," Backstrom said with a laugh. "But I don't think so." 
</P>
<P>

High School, 1500 Ball Road, Anaheim. $10; children free with adult

 Fluor Corp. said Thursday it finally has sold the lead mining business that 
had been weighing down its profits for several years. 
</P>
<P>
 Terms of the sale of St. Louis-based Doe Run Co. to an affiliate of the Renco 
Group in New York were not disclosed, but Fluor officials said the deal would 
have no impact on the corporation's earnings -- meaning it was probably sold 
for the $175 million at which Fluor valued the subsidiary's assets. 
</P>
<P>
 While this deal is not expected to alter Fluor's bottom line for 1994, the 
company still stands to glean big benefits from the sale: Renco has relieved 
Fluor, an international construction and engineering firm, of all liabilities 
from the mining and sale of lead products. 
</P>
<P>
 Lead is a toxic metal and Fluor officials reportedly had become increasingly 
concerned about the potentially huge cost of cleaning up mining and processing 
sites and of the potential for damaging litigation by workers and consumers who 
might contend that their health was injured by lead mined in Doe Run 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
 The ruinous costs of asbestos-related health claims helped drive Manville 
Corp. and other asbestos producers into bankruptcy in the 1980s. By 1990 
Manville had paid more than $1.1 billion to settle claims. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sure everybody at Fluor is happy" about being relieved of liability, said 
analyst John N. Simon of the Seidler Group in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Fluor's common stock rose $1.625 a share Thursday in moderate trading on the 
New York Stock Exchange, closing at $53.75 a share. The Doe Run sale was 
announced after the market closed. 
</P>
<P>
 Fluor has been trying to sell Doe Run since 1992, when it declared it a 
discontinued operation and set aside a $79-million reserve to cover estimated 
losses from the future sale of the subsidiary. 
</P>
<P>
 In its 1993 annual report, Fluor said it lost a further $30 million on lead 
mining operations despite sales revenue of $121 million from the subsidiary. 
</P>
<P>
 The sale to Renco Group included a cash payment to Fluor as well as an 
interest-bearing note. Fluor will also share in Doe Run's future profitability, 
but the company said it otherwise will have no ongoing involvement in the lead 
business. 
</P>
<P>
 In a statement issued Thursday, Fluor Chairman Les McCraw said doe Run "no 
longer fits our long-term strategic direction. Their new association with the 
Renco Group is an excellent fit and is in the best interest of all stake 
holders." 
</P>
<P>
 Renco Group, which had about $1.3 billion in sales last year, is a privately 
owned holding company with investments in natural resources and industrial 
operations. Its holdings include a steel mill in Toledo, Ohio; a magnesium 
producer, a women's handbag factory and AM General, the company that makes the 
Hummer all-terrain vehicle used by U.S. military forces. 
</P>
<P>
 Doe Run is the largest integrated producer of lead in North America, with 1994 
production estimated at 190,000 tons. The company has about 800 workers at six 
mines, four mills and two smelters, all located in southeast Missouri.

YOUNG BARGAIN HUNTERS GRIN AT STOCK SLIP; INVESTING: FALLING PRICES GIVE 
INVESTORS THE CHANCE TO BUY IN AT BETTER PRICES. SMART INVESTORS BUY WHEN 
OTHERS SELL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The younger you are, the happier you should be when stock prices plunge, money 
managers like to say. 
</P>
<P>
 Those falling prices give young investors -- anybody with money they can tie 
up for five years or more -- the chance to buy in at better prices. A stock 
that was universally loved last week at $35 a share ought to be even more 
popular this week at $27. 
</P>
<P>
 That's a lesson many investors seem to have learned. By the beginning of this 
week, institutional investors and a few hardy individuals were striding toward 
the market with their shopping baskets in hand, looking for bargains left on 
the floor amid all the ripped up "sell" orders executed in the week before 
Easter. 
</P>
<P>
 "We like corrections," says Denis Leplaige, director of equity investing for 
New York money managers MacKay-Shields Financial Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like getting a free bonus. We get a chance to look for new ideas or pick 
up some old ideas at valuations we couldn't get even a week ago." 
</P>
<P>
 Smart investors buy when most investors are selling, but it is a little more 
complicated than that. Some stocks are forced down by the 
sinking-tide-lowers-all-boats effect, but others are drawn down for valid 
reasons and might take longer to bounce back. 
</P>
<P>
 If we're not in the big bad bear, we aren't exactly in the 
any-fool-can-make-money bull either, and it's the judicious stock picker who 
will benefit from recent events. 
</P>
<P>
 "People really have to be selective when it comes to choosing whatever stocks 
they want to add to their portfolio," cautions Sam Stovall, editor of Standard 
& Poor's Industry Reports and an expert in sector trends. 
</P>
<P>
 What kind of selectivity works in today's shaky stock market? The same kind 
that works at the shopping malls -- go for durable, quality merchandise that's 
on sale and in season. 
</P>
<P>
 Leplaige, for example, cautions investors to consider where we are in the 
business cycle. 
</P>
<P>
 Many economists believe the United States is moving into the expansion phase 
of the business cycle. That's good for steel, oil and apparel and not so good 
for interest-sensitive industries like banking, home building and utilities. 
So, while there are good buys on the Street now for steel companies and banks, 
for example, it would take a more patient investor to make money off the banks 
than the steel companies, says Leplaige. 
</P>
<P>
 Investors should consider which sectors have taken the greatest hits, says 
Stovall. Manufactured housing was the biggest loser in the seven days that 
ended March 31, falling 15.7%, he points out. Not too far behind were stocks in 
these sectors -- hotel/motel (gaming); communications equipment; miscellaneous 
metals (not including gold); home building, computer software and services; 
personal loan companies; automobiles, aluminum and brokerage firms. All are 
likely prospects for bargain hunters. 
</P>
<P>
 Some companies that proved resilient most recently had been beaten down before 
March went out like a bear. Those include utilities, among the most interest 
rate-sensitive of sectors, and investors already had discounted the impact of 
significant rate hikes on utility stocks. Drugs and other health-care stocks, 
too, had been beaten down for some time. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think some good quality utilities have been oversold, and I think biotech 
medical stocks have been oversold," says Richard Maturi, author of "The 11 Best 
Tactics For Beating the Market." 
</P>
<P>
 To find stock market bargains, don't just look at this week's price compared 
to last week's. Use traditional measures of value -- compare a stock's price to 
its earnings and to its cash flow, advises Leplaige, and buy companies in which 
these ratios are below their average levels. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, most experts caution that even bargain hunters should not spend all 
their money. There's always something new coming on sale, and there's more from 
where the most recent "correction" came from. "I don't think we're done yet," 
says Maturi.

A SUNNY FUTURE FOR SUNGLASS HUT; SALES: THE SUCCESSFUL RETAILER PLANS TO ISSUE 
A MAIL-ORDER CATALOGUE AND SELL ITS PRODUCTS ON CABLE TELEVISION, AS WELL AS 
EXPAND ITS OUTLETS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Sunglass Hut International is out to sell a little shade to everyone under the 
sun. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our goal is literally to put sunglasses on every face in the world," said 
Jack Chadsey, president and chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
 The rapidly growing company, which went public last June, is already the 
largest specialty retailer of non-prescription sunglasses. It will issue its 
first mail-order catalogue May 1 and has begun talks to explore selling 
sunglasses on cable television's Home Shopping Network. 
</P>
<P>
 Sales have soared to $180 million in 1993 from $73 million in 1989, a 25% 
compounded annual growth rate. 
</P>
<P>
 Figuring into the company's success is a trend toward sunglass endorsement by 
celebrities, said Ogi Ellison, manager of Sunglass Huts in Huntington Beach and 
Westminster. Figure skater Nancy Kerrigan promotes Ray Bans; several baseball 
players have endorsed Oakleys. 
</P>
<P>
 "The coaches tell the baseball players to come over here and buy them," she 
said. The same goes for volleyball players, she added. 
</P>
<P>
 There is actually more to sunglasses than meets the eyes, Ellison said. 
Boaters should use sunglasses with polarized lenses and skiers need "irradium" 
lenses to protect against glare, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I train all my associates to know the products," Ellison said. 
</P>
<P>
 Chadsey, the company's CEO, said his tactic is to flood the market with 
Sunglass Hut outlets. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunglass Hut has 700 stores in the United States, Canada, Puerto Rico, the 
U.S. Virgin Islands and Britain. Seven of the stores are in Orange County. It 
hopes to boost the total to 2,500 stores in the next six years, adding stores 
in Mexico, Japan and Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunglass Hut carries about 1,000 styles of sunglasses in each store, including 
highly visible brands such as Ray Ban, Oakley and Serengeti. It focuses on the 
fast-growing over-$30 segment of the market and has an average sale price of 
$77, compared with an industry average of $19.95. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whether you end up buying your sunglasses on television, when you're buying 
them on mail order, if you're buying them in the mall, if you're buying them in 
a department store, our goal ultimately is one way or another, you're going to 
be buying them at Sunglass Hut," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 And no matter how many pairs you buy, you will probably lose them or break 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 "The average person buys somewhere between 40 to 50 pairs of sunglasses over 
the course of a lifetime. So we want them buying 40 or 50 pairs of sunglasses 
at an average ticket of $77, not at $19.95," Chadsey said. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the Miami-based company's existing stores and kiosks are in shopping 
malls. The company is increasingly pursuing other high-traffic sites such as 
theme parks, airports and major hotels. 
</P>
<P>
 Its 200-square-foot store in Miami International Airport is already the 
company's top seller with $2 million in annual sales. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunglass Hut has taken over the sunglass department at Selfridges store in 
London and is pursuing similar leasing arrangements with other major department 
stores. 
</P>
<P>
 In the last year, it has expanded its private label line, Sun Gear, which 
sells in the $40-to-$60 range, and added a children's line that sells in the 
$25-to-$30 range. The latter is selling well, thanks in part to parental 
concern about their children's health. 
</P>
<P>
 "A study came into the marketplace a couple of years ago saying kids' eyes are 
something like nine times more susceptible to ultraviolet rays than adults," 
Chadsey said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want you to go out in the sun," he said. "We want you to have fun but wear 
an SPF 15 on your skin to protect yourself and wear a quality pair of 
sunglasses to protect your eyes." 
</P>
<P>
 Sunglass Hut is also targeting the 55% of the population that wears 
prescription lenses through a discount lens agreement with Lens Crafters, whose 
optical shops are in many of the same malls as Sunglass Hut. 
</P>
<P>
 Several analysts have issued buy recommendations on its stock, citing the 
company's broad selection, well-trained salespeople, volume buying and 
state-of-the art distribution system that lets it tailor merchandise to fit 
local demographics. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunglass Hut stock was trading at $33.875, down 37 1/2 cents Wednesday on the 
Nasdaq market. Fittingly enough, the company's ticker symbol is RAYS. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're going to continue to show very strong same-store sales gains and 
earnings growth and gain market share," said Maureen McGrath, who follows the 
company for Smith Barney Shearson. 
</P>
<P>
 "The company has reached a point in terms of developing critical mass so that 
it definitely has the buying power that nobody else does," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Acquisitions have become an important part of the company's growth strategy. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Sunglass Hut acquired Sun Mark's 134 outlets. It bought a chain of 
18 stores from Wallis Arnold Enterprises Inc. in January and announced plans 
last month to buy SunVision Inc., a chain of 14 stores in the Northeast. 
</P>
<P>
 Although it reported a 1-cent loss per share for 1993, the figures reflected 
debt retirement that left the company with a clean balance sheet. Adjusted for 
non-recurring expenses, the 1993 earnings were 84 cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
 Wall Street analysts are predicting 1994 earnings of $1.30 a share. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunglass Hut already has about 15% of the $2.1-billion non-prescription 
sunglass market. No competitor has more than 3%. 
</P>
<P>
 The company was started by optometrist Sanford Ziff with a single sunglass 
kiosk in a Miami shopping mall in 1971. It grew to 100 stores by 1987, when 
Ziff sold 75% of the company to a group of investors. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ziff family ran the company until Chadsey was recruited from Dayton Hudson 
Corp.'s specialty store division in 1990.

MTI TECHNOLOGY STOCK OFFER RAISES $33 MILLION; COMPUTERS: IT IS DATA-STORAGE 
FIRM'S FIRST PUBLIC OFFERING. INVESTORS GARNER AN ADDITIONAL $15.3 MILLION IN 
OWN SALE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Fast-growing MTI Technology Corp. raised more than $30 million Thursday with 
its first public stock offering while several of its key investors garnered an 
additional $15.3 million selling shares of their own. 
</P>
<P>
 The offering by the data storage company occurred at the end of a tumultuous 
two weeks that saw the market drop by almost 200 points. 
</P>
<P>
 The company issued 4 million shares of common stock at $9 each and cleared 
$33.5 million after underwriting fees. At the same time, insiders including 
Chairman Ray Noorda sold a total of 1.7 million of their shares at the same 
price. The stock will be traded on the Nasdaq, over-the-counter market. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has been extremely hard to get an offering done in this very volatile 
market, so the fact that they got it done says a lot of good about the 
company," said Kathleen S. Smith, an analyst with Renaissance Capital Corp., an 
industry analysis company in Greenwich, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think people are looking at MTI being a strong player in the market this 
year," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith said MTI's management group is especially impressive because of the 
members' backgrounds in computer systems development. Noorda, the chairman, 
also is chairman of computer software giant Novell Corp. of Provo, Utah. 
</P>
<P>
 MTI, founded in 1979, develops, sells and services data storage systems for 
mid-size business computer networks. It has 600 employees at facilities in the 
United States and Europe. The company has more than doubled its sales since 
1990, when it first topped $50 million in revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith said MTI is particularly competitive because it makes so-called open 
system products that can run on all of the most popular business computer 
operating systems. Companies like International Business Machines have resisted 
making products that run on other computer makers' machines while MTI products 
run on IBM, Unix and DEC operating systems. 
</P>
<P>
 MTI reported profit of $1.5 million on $86 million in sales for the nine 
months ended Jan. 1. For the entire 1993 fiscal year, ended April 3, 1993, MTI 
reported sales of $116 million and a $8.9 million loss after a one-time charge 
of $10.1 million to settle a patent infringement lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 Steven J. Hamerslag, MTI president, said proceeds from the stock sale would be 
used to repay debts and for working capital. 
</P>
<P>
 The offering was underwritten by Prudential Securities and Furman Selz, both 
New York investment banks.

BRIEFCASE: BANKING; INDEPENDENCE ONE HOPING TO OBTAIN COMMERCIAL STATUS BEFORE 
END OF YEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Independence One Bank acts like a commercial bank and is run by commercial 
bankers -- and can't wait until it turns into a commercial bank. 
</P>
<P>
 The Laguna Hills institution is actually a savings and loan that must devote 
70% of its loans to home financing, not an activity to which bankers are 
accustomed. 
</P>
<P>
 But executives are negotiating with federal thrift regulators and the Internal 
Revenue Service to clear the way for Independence One to convert to a bank, 
which would allow it to make many more business and consumer loans and many 
fewer home loans. 
</P>
<P>
 Independence One is the successor to the old Beverly Hills Savings & Loan, one 
of the first major California thrifts to fail in the mid-1980s. Regulators sold 
the thrift to Michigan National Corp., a major banking company, at the end of 
1988 with a promise to pay $800 million over 10 years to make up for the deep 
hole in the failed thrift's finances. 
</P>
<P>
 Michigan National has long wanted to turn the thrift into a bank, but it would 
lose the tax-free interest on the government note, as well as other major tax 
benefits, if it agrees to accept an early payoff. 
</P>
<P>
 Talks with government officials stalled last year as the Clinton 
Administration took office, but they're back on track now. The government could 
save about $16 million in interest payments if it could repay the note now. It 
still owes $348 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know how soon things will happen," said Edward H. Sondker, president 
of Independence One, "but I'm optimistic that something will happen this year." 
</P>
<P>
 Once the matter is resolved, Sondker said, Independence One will seek its bank 
charter immediately. When it does, it will become Orange County's biggest 
independent bank with more than $600 million in loans and other assets. 
</P>
<P>
 Meantime, the thrift evaluates its loans as if it were a bank. Instead of 
providing mortgages directly to consumers, it makes "business" loans to 
mortgage bankers, who loan the money to homeowners. Such loans, together with 
the government note, are how the thrift now meets its 70% home-financing test.

 Privately owned CaseWare in Irvine develops and markets software management 
systems for computers using the Unix operating system -- a system used mainly

 Ex-Banker Sued Again: Former Orange County banker Ronald L. Rodgers is facing 
more legal problems, but he may not know it yet. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodgers, ousted last year from his position as president of Bank of Newport, 
was sued last week by Frontier Bank in La Palma for defaulting on a $130,000 
loan.But a lawyer for the bank said no one has been able to find the one-time 
banker to serve him with the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to locate Mr. Rodgers now," said Frontier's lawyer, Thomas J. 
Prenovost Jr. of Santa Ana. "We believe he moved out of state two or three 
months ago. We think he might be in Florida." 
</P>
<P>
 Bank of Newport had no idea Rodgers was gone. The bank had sued Rodgers in 
January, alleging that he and his secretary lived the high life on bank expense 
accounts. Rodgers later married his secretary, Verna Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
 Stephen M. Magro of Orange, who represents Rodgers in the Bank of Newport suit 
only, said he is in touch with Rodgers, but he refused to say where his client 
might be. Rodgers has denied all the allegations in the Bank of Newport 
lawsuit.

STATORDYNE RINGS UP TWO MAJOR SALES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Statordyne Corp. said Thursday that it has made two deals to sell electrical 
power protection systems -- transactions Statordyne called "another important 
step in our transition from a development-stage enterprise to an operating 
company." 
</P>
<P>
 A $256,000 order from the nation's largest Caterpillar dealer -- Ringhaver 
Power Systems in Tampa, Fla. -- boosted Statordyne's backlog of orders to $1.1 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 The Anaheim company said it also sold a $186,000 system to the American Assn. 
of Retired Persons.

TUG OF WAR; CONSUMERS LOVE THE LOWER PRICES, BUT O.C. DESIGNERS HATE IT WHEN 
THEIR MERCHANDISE SHOWS UP AT SWAP MEETS OR DISCOUNT WAREHOUSES WITHOUT THEIR 
CONSENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHRYN BOLD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mention the word "diverters" to Mossimo Giannulli, and the Irvine-based 
fashion designer grows noticeably agitated. 
</P>
<P>
 After calling them a few choice names, he calms down just a little: 
</P>
<P>
 "They're people who see an opportunity when a label's hot to make extra 
dough," he says. "It's so unethical." 
</P>
<P>
 His sentiments are shared by another Orange County designer, Shawn Stussy, as 
well as the people at Quiksilver, Vans and other manufacturers who have been 
stymied by diverters. 
</P>
<P>
 Diverters buy popular brand name goods such as Mossimo T-shirts or Vans tennis 
shoes from retailers and distributors and sell them to stores and discounters 
that aren't authorized to carry them. 
</P>
<P>
 That's how a name such as Mossimo, which is typically carried at specialty 
shops, can end up at a swap meet or a discount chain such as Price Club. 
Giannulli once discovered 1,000 of his T-shirts at Price Club selling for $5 
below their regular retail price. 
</P>
<P>
 Although consumers benefit, the practice drives manufacturers crazy. They 
invest heavily in advertising and marketing to cultivate the right image for 
their product. If their customers see their in-season merchandise in a swap 
meet or other undesirable location, the goods can lose their mystique, they 
say. 
</P>
<P>
 "If (diverting) happens at all, it's a big problem," Giannulli says. "You work 
so hard to create an image. That's all you really have." 
</P>
<P>
 On three occasions Giannulli has bought back his merchandise to keep the 
Mossimo name out of Price Club and other discount chains. The latest incident 
took place six months ago, when he purchased $20,000 of Mossimo apparel from a 
discounter. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you're in a store with less of an image than you're trying to portray, it 
can hurt your image. It scares the hell out of me, because I want to be here a 
while," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Diverting is a headache for Stussy as well. An unauthorized surf-and-sport 
shop in Newport Beach not only sells Stussy designs purchased from diverters, 
it occasionally features Stussy in its window display. 
</P>
<P>
 Such tactics hurt those stores that legitimately buy and sell the Stussy line, 
says Shawn Stussy, president of the Irvine-based men's clothing company. 
</P>
<P>
 "It might be a great store, but it could be across the street from a guy who's 
been with us since the get-go," Stussy says. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, diverting can saturate the market with too much product. 
</P>
<P>
 "By controlling the size, you control the hipness" of your merchandise, Stussy 
says. "By not being in every store, you're known as an exclusive thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Vans also takes diverting seriously. The company hires detectives to hunt down 
diverters, polices swap meets and discount stores to see if they are carrying 
Vans shoes and secretly marks merchandise to find out which of its distributors 
is rerouting orders. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we sell to a distributor and his agreement is to sell Vans shoes to Mexico 
and we find them in Los Angeles at a swap meet, it could damage our name," says 
Craig Gosselin, vice president and general counsel for Vans Inc. in Orange. 
"Vans has a reputation for quality that people don't associate with heavily 
discounted goods. It hurts." 
</P>
<P>
 There are many methods of diverting, but one of the most common occurs when a 
retailer has leftover stock and sells it to a diverter, who then turns around 
and sells the goods to an unauthorized party. 
</P>
<P>
 Such incidents are on the rise because the recession has left some retailers 
with excess merchandise they need to unload, says Frank Quinlan, a former FBI 
agent and attorney who handles white-collar fraud cases with Kester & Quinlan 
in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Distributors, the go-betweens between manufacturers and retailers, get into 
the act by violating their agreements with manufacturers to only sell the goods 
in certain markets, Quinlan says. 
</P>
<P>
 "They might only be able to sell in Newport Beach, but if the market is slow 
in Newport Beach they may turn around and sell the goods in another country," 
he says. 
</P>
<P>
 They can also sell their surplus inventory to a local discounter, who can 
afford to charge less than the full retail price charged by finer stores. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most distributors mark up the goods, and the retailer marks it up even 
further," Gosselin says. "If a diverter isn't selling it to the retailer, he is 
selling it to a discounter who has a low overhead and won't need to take as 
high of a markup." 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes diverting takes place at the shipyards -- when merchandise earmarked 
for one country gets rerouted to another country that has lax import and 
trademark laws. Distributors have been known to agree to sell goods to a South 
American country, then turn around and sell their orders to France or another 
country where they can bring a higher price, Quinlan says. 
</P>
<P>
 "A T-shirt that sells for $15 in Newport Beach might sell for $40 in France," 
Quinlan says. "There's a profit incentive to divert." 
</P>
<P>
 Quiksilver, a Costa Mesa-based sportswear company, has found diverting to be a 
global problem. Sometimes Quiksilver goods bound for South America will be 
transferred to Europe, where they can fetch higher prices, says Tom Holbrook, 
vice president of sales for Quiksilver. Products can even find their way back 
into the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a black market for anything that's popular," Holbrook says. 
</P>
<P>
 Stopping diverters is not easy. 
</P>
<P>
 In the United States there is no law that prohibits someone from selling a 
product purchased from someone else. To protect themselves, manufacturers draw 
up contracts with their distributors that specify where the goods can be sold. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they break the agreement, it's a breach of contract. The manufacturer can 
get an injunction (to stop the distributor from selling the goods) and sue," 
Quinlan says. "But it can be hard to prove damages." 
</P>
<P>
 The most obvious damage is hard to calculate in dollars -- the loss of esteem 
to the product name. 
</P>
<P>
 "Consider St. John Knits. If you found them at Price Club, would you find them 
as attractive?" Quinlan says. "You're dealing with an ego market." 
</P>
<P>
 Other damages are easier to document. For instance, if a distributor diverts 
10,000 T-shirts to a swap meet and "sales at local shops go down the drain, the 
stores won't order more T-shirts," Quinlan says. "The manufacturer will suffer 
a loss of sales" that can be proved on paper. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, collecting from diverters can be difficult because they are often 
small, fly-by-night operators. 
</P>
<P>
 The best solution, Quinlan says, is to try to prevent diverting from happening 
in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
 "You should have clear agreements with your distributors and let them know you 
won't tolerate it," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Manufacturers can protect themselves by dealing with reputable distributors 
known for honoring their agreements, Quinlan says. They can also use computers 
to track unusually large orders. If a local distributor buys 5,000 T-shirts, 
then suddenly doubles the order, that can be a sign of diverting, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 When diverting is discovered, often the most cost-effective way to stop it is 
to confront the distributor and terminate the agreement. Many manufacturers, 
including Giannulli, immediately cut off distributors who sell to the wrong 
parties. If the incident involves "a big dollar impact" on the company, then a 
lawsuit might be in order, Quinlan says. 
</P>
<P>
 "Manufacturers are not defenseless," he says. "They have the right to protect 
themselves from these attacks."

THE FALL COLLECTIONS / NEW YORK; ITSY-BITSY CHIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JILL GERSTON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After a three-week hiatus, time enough to repack the slip dresses and combat 
boots that are the uniform of fashion hounds, the shows of fall ready-to-wear 
resumed Wednesday under two tents pitched behind the New York Public Library. 
</P>
<P>
 The eight-day schedule could choke even the most voracious clotheshorse: 76 
back-to-back shows, a cocktail reception by the Council of Fashion Designers of 
America, panel discussions sponsored by Mirabella and Harper's Bazaar, a 
Diamond Information Center breakfast and a slew of private parties, including a 
dinner hosted by Calvin Klein and a model-celebrity bash given by the British 
firm Ghost. 
</P>
<P>
 But even such inducements as free bottles of Evian, stacks of fashion 
magazines, a Prescriptives make-over and a Pantone color consultation won't 
stifle the weariness sure to set in by week's end. The fashion troops seem a 
tad grumpy already. Maybe it's the combination of chilly, rainy weather and a 
spate of opening shows that were repetitious, uninspired and at times downright 
silly. 
</P>
<P>
 The runways were swimming in itsy-bitsy dresses and skirts that barely covered 
the crotch. Pants made only rare appearances, and forget about jackets. They've 
been replaced by loose, droopy sweaters, either ribbed or in nubby wool. 
</P>
<P>
 Although it's laudable that designers have labored to find a fresher, softer 
alternative to the conventional structured suit, it's doubtful women will swoon 
over fuzzy sweaters and teeny knit dresses paired with over-the-knee stockings 
and chunky boots. It's a look better suited to Kate Moss than to the rest of 
us. 
</P>
<P>
 No one tried harder to make a statement for little flared dresses than Donna 
Karan in her hipper-than-thou DKNY collection, whose target audience seems to 
be blank-faced twentysomethings with disheveled hair and daddy's charge card. 
</P>
<P>
 If you had to choose a single item to sum up the DKNY attitude, it would be a 
baggy, bunched-up oatmeal tweed sweater drooping over a tiny flippy skirt 
revealing pipe-cleaner legs in suede desert boots. Or maybe a tartan mini 
fluffed out with a crinoline and paired with a riding jacket and a pristine, 
schoolgirlish white blouse. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Karan doesn't miss a trend: "deconstructionist" chinos with raw-edge hems, 
distressed shearling coats, leather aprons, shrunken sweaters, kilts, and the 
ubiquitous over-the-knee stockings, among others. And she is probably the first 
designer to show bouffant dance dresses and ball gowns in hot-pink and 
acid-green neoprene. 
</P>
<P>
 The fluorescent scuba styles bobbing down the runway drew applause, probably 
from editors eager to do photo layouts titled: "Neoprene Dives Into Style!" 
Buyers may have a tougher time envisioning customers plucking them off the 
racks. But you never know. 
</P>
<P>
 Adrienne Vittadini was also crazy about tiny pleated tartan skirts and little 
knit dresses, but she presented her collection with less attitude. Although her 
restraint was admirable -- Karan's street chic can be contrived -- the clothes 
seemed bland. Why didn't Vittadini, who is masterful with prints, liven things 
up with her signature patterned knits? 
</P>
<P>
 Except for a group of shrunken sweater sets in neon-bright mohair, the 
designer stuck to dark and sober shades, such as navy, plum and gray. Her 
nubby, flared sweater-dresses grazed the derriere and were worn with ribbed 
tights and riding boots. For more coverage, they could probably be tossed over 
pants, which were scarce here. Her oversize knit tunics had knit scarves coiled 
at the neck to form deep, cowl-like collars. Not exactly an earth-shattering 
idea, but one that looked great. 
</P>
<P>
 On a different wavelength entirely was Randy Kemper, whose fans include 
Margaux Hemingway and Hillary Rodham Clinton. Forget shrunken mohair sweater 
sets and itty-bitty kilts. Kemper is into commercial wearability -- cuffed 
trousers, crepe trousers, strong-shouldered jackets -- stuff to wear in the 
boardroom. Next to the babyish clothing in other lines, these day clothes 
looked surprisingly staid.  
</P>
<P>
 The best items in Kemper's show were his big, plush, fake-fur coats; floaty 
silk trench coats lined in a leopard print, and a streamlined sage wool 
jumpsuit gleaming with little zippers. Old-time film goddesses were the 
inspiration for Kemper's vampy evening clothes, from satin lounging pajamas to 
bias-cut slip dresses that should never leave the boudoir. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Eisen's show started off on a promising note with skinny black pantsuits, 
a camel duffel coat, and vests and minis in black and camel tartan. After that, 
things turned. A tight mohair suit in screaming tangerine, shiny black vinyl 
jeans worn with four-inch spikes, and micro minis trimmed with stiff, brushlike 
feathers had more than a few viewers staring blankly into space. If only the 
talented Eisen would get rid of the gimmicks. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If there was one streak of light in the early round of shows, it was Byron 
Lars' zippy collection that tossed together the fashion passions -- fake fur, 
riding jackets and sweater-dresses -- with bits of colorful beads and feathers 
and vibrant African prints. 
</P>
<P>
 Everything was done in a lighthearted, don't-take-fashion-so-seriously spirit, 
and the show worked because firmly tailored, well-cut sportswear was the 
foundation of all the fun.  
</P>
<P>
 Narrow, pin-striped charcoal suits; slouchy charcoal wool trousers; men's 
shirts, and leather aviator jackets were enlivened with collars of colorful 
beads, coiled and feathered headdresses, African mask backpacks and shawls 
lined in vivid African prints.  
</P>
<P>
 Even the models seemed to enjoy tossing their acrylic cornrows and swirling 
their printed shawls as they strutted to pulsating music. Let's hope some of 
the other designers pick up Lars' beat. 
</P>
<P>
 Next: The collections of Anne Klein, Todd Oldham, Anna Sui and Vera Wang.

DECAFFEINATING POETRY; A SERIES OF READINGS AT THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY MUSEUM OF

<P>
 It's hard to say what painter Ernst Ludwig Kirchner might have said had he 
glimpsed it. If he were a man of good humor, he surely would have been a bit 
bemused. 
</P>
<P>
 Standing before his canvas "Two Women," which elegantly details two stately 
women in broad black chapeaus, cowgirl poets Gail (Calamity) Wronsky and Molly 
(Belle) Bendall -- in suede boots, denim and vests, all topped off, of course, 
with broad-brimmed hats -- put the finishing touches on their own evocative 
tableau. 
</P>
<P>
 In a soft lilt, rounding out her love song, Calamity intones: 
</P>
<P>
 " And so the two of us dove over the edge of that precipice, so to speak, into 
the diamond-studded, deep black velvet waves of the crazy quilt which is a 
cowgirl's nighttime sky. " 
</P>
<P>
 There is a pause. Then cascading applause. 
</P>
<P>
 A woman pushing a baby stroller peeks around the corner into the gallery at 
the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. A touch bewildered, she takes in the 
source of this lively explosion of words that rise from a space usually as cool 
and as quiet as a tomb. 
</P>
<P>
 The Friday evening series, Writers in Focus, certainly isn't writer-poet Meri 
Nana-Ama Danquah's blushing first attempt to assemble hidden local talent and 
place them center stage. The series, which was launched in February with David 
L. Ulin and Russell Leong, has featured Wronsky and Bendall along with locals 
Kene Holliday and Joel Lipman. 
</P>
<P>
 Series curator Danquah, 26, is also associate director at Theater L.A. and has 
lent her name and organizing efforts to many a workshop, benefit and reading 
series. The jewel is the popular Thursday night series at Rosalind African 
Restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked last summer to participate in a special event in conjunction with 
African American artist Jacob Lawrence's exhibit at LACMA, Danquah says she was 
struck by her own juxtaposition -- reading her words amid precious works of 
art: 
</P>
<P>
 "It was real incredible to me . . . I never had a reading like that before in 
my life. You walk into LACMA and you've got this audience who is thirsty for 
art. . . . They are not the people who would come hear you read at Joe Blow's 
coffee shop. They are not the people who would come hear you at Whittier 
College . . . but they are people who go to LACMA and subscribe because they 
are people who love art. . . . It's a wonderful thing for LACMA to embrace the 
spoken word as an art." 
</P>
<P>
 Danquah is not simply an advocate for the spoken word. She has emerged as a 
doting surrogate parent of sorts to L.A.'s booming literary scene. And as any 
concerned parent would, she has observed that for writers interested in 
presenting their work to a varied audience, there isn't always a natural 
progression, one commensurate with the trajectory of their careers. 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond Baroque, the Venice literary center, has provided a highly visible and 
comparatively accessible stage, she concedes. But reading series hosted by the 
Lannan Foundation and Chateau Marmont are limited to those writers who have 
been knighted with "star status," Danquah maintains. And while coffeehouses are 
moody workshop settings for the spoken word, Danquah wants to continually up 
the ante. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you go to coffee shops, you have people who just sort of stumble in just 
because they want a cup of coffee or a cappuccino. It's very pedestrian, it's a 
starting level," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 With the LACMA series, Danquah hopes to rescue some of the city's more tenured 
poets and writers from nightly competition with the whir of the coffee grinder, 
the roar of a Pasquini machine steaming milk. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Somehow, somewhere, the two became synonymous, or, at the very least, 
irrecoverably tied: java and word jazz. When literary salons moved out of 
Verdi-filled parlors in the '50s, they set up shop in the noisy basements of 
bookstores or coffeehouses scattered liberally around such bohemian enclaves as 
Greenwich Village and San Francisco's North Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Although a small, underground scene existed on the fringes of the beat 
movement -- in what was then called "Venice West" -- it wasn't until a few 
decades later that thirsty L.A. fully drank in coffeehouse culture and all that 
accompanied it. 
</P>
<P>
 The '90s have exploded with espresso bars furbished to look like everything 
from someone's living room to a drafty monastery chapel filled with 
hard-on-the-tailbone pews, and offering everything from open-mike nights to 
poetry slams. The city's neo-beat literary scene, rejuvenated as much by the 
allure of rap as by the inevitable fond-glance-backward nostalgia, has provided 
behind-the-mike venues for poets. 
</P>
<P>
 But for many who have made the rounds for decade or two, a noisy coffeehouse 
gig is no longer looked upon as an opportunity, but rather an insult. 
</P>
<P>
 "This series helps writers who have been blocked," says Harvey R. Kubernik, a 
local recording producer and audio poet. "You don't have to be 48 years old 
with a book to be heard. Meri's acknowledging a native voice . . . and creating 
an open-door policy for writers who have been feeling that academia has been 
taking cuts in line." 
</P>
<P>
 With LACMA, Danquah plans to create something on the scale of the St. Marks 
Poetry Project or the 92nd Street Y -- New York institutions whose names carry 
formidable weight in literary circles nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 "It means that they have some amount of established reputation . . . that 
you've sort of been sanctioned by this institution," she says. In L.A., "There 
is no middle ground." So Danquah pursued Lisa Vihos, LACMA's associate museum 
educator, after the Lawrence series. "I thought that it was the responsibility 
of the museum as an arts institution to foster talent in that area," Danquah 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 Although still in its fledgling stage, and requiring skills worlds away from 
hanging canvases, LACMA is ready to press forward. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're just really excited about providing a venue," Vihos says. "It's just 
another branch. We plan these evenings to take place on Friday night . . . an 
active time in the museum. We have jazz on the plaza and wanted to encourage 
people to come into the gallery. By having the reading . . . we get people who 
are enjoying the music to come inside, (while) the museum-goers are hearing 
poetry." 
</P>
<P>
 Poet Sesshu Foster, who will read later this month with Michelle T. Clinton, 
points out that mixing media can work on many levels: "I hope that it would 
encourage more interchange and interaction between different arts and artists. 
The best thing that can come out of all of this would be some 
cross-fertilization of aesthetics and ideas. A kind of informal multicultural 
exchange within an established institution. I think the more that kind of 
movement becomes more fluid, the healthier it becomes, for everybody, in the 
long run." 
</P>
<P>
 Wronsky, who teaches creative writing at Loyola Marymount University, believes 
that the emphasis on performance most characterizes poetry in L.A. She has 
noted a direct correlation between performances and increased enrollment in 
classes concentrating on constructing verse. 
</P>
<P>
 "Poetry is much more visible than it used to be. It's not considered quite so 
effete anymore," Wronsky says. "Students are not afraid to write really raunchy 
stuff. They've seen it in print. They know that they can write about their 
inner lives, talk about it in workshop, and they won't be censored. It is 
serving some important function in their lives." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The series' most beguiling feature -- the energy and diversity of the 
coffeehouse scene fused with the rarefied atmosphere of a high-art venue -- may 
have a catch, Wronsky points out. 
</P>
<P>
 Language and content that might pass without pause at the Onyx or the Iguana 
Cafe may not wash with the museum set, as performance artist Elia Arce and 
poet-journalist Ruben Martinez found on a recent evening. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a lot of graphic fusion between flesh and spirit," recalls 
Martinez. "I did notice some people moving around . . . a lot of tension in the 
room. . . . (But LACMA) didn't ask us about the nature of our material. If they 
are concerned for their audience, well then, what do they think poets write 
about? Maybe LACMA isn't used to the art world I'm used to. . . . They can deal 
with Diebenkorn . . . but nothing that rests out of the classical mainstream. 
I've never censored myself for anybody. I don't think art and censorship mix." 
</P>
<P>
 Arce, too, replays the scene, but with a shade of bemused detachment: "It's so 
funny you know, because usually I do that piece nude," she says with a generous 
laugh. "But I thought . . . I'll be conservative . . . I'll put on a lace 
dress." 
</P>
<P>
 There were other compromises as well. Her trademark props -- a candelabrum and 
incense -- went against museum rules. "I guess," Arce admits, "I felt that I 
didn't belong there. The minute I had to start making concessions that directly 
affected the presentation of my art . . . that immediately made me feel a 
separation between what is shown there as 'real art' and my work." 
</P>
<P>
 Interestingly enough, Vihos says, although there was plenty of strong imagery 
and language -- and about 10 people from a capacity crowd of about 100 left -- 
"Nobody came up to me and said they were upset." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, however, LACMA is taking precautions. An on-site placard that announces 
the readings warns: "Some of the language and topics may be objectionable to 
some visitors. Discretion is advised." 
</P>
<P>
 At first, Danquah admits, that news annoyed her "because I really wanted to go 
like gangbusters. I mean isn't that the issue, First Amendment? . . . I think 
what they expected was 'nice poetry,' which is what I'm giving them. It's just 
a different definition of nice ." 
</P>
<P>
 But now she realizes that "you have to give a little to get a little. . . . 
It's not going to kill me or my writers." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, she plans to concentrate on the rest of this season, which will 
include readings by Luis Alfaro, Michele M. Serros, Ralph Angel, David St. 
John, Clinton and Foster. The line-up for next season, once again focusing on 
L.A. writers, is just about set, but long-term funding is still in the works. 
And, says Danquah, who has provided her services gratis, "They've insisted on 
setting aside some funds with which to pay me." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, she says the biggest boon is the nugget of insurance offered by linking 
up with an institution: "I wanted . . . an arts institution to take (the 
series) up because if I decide to step down as a curator it still exists . . . 
(and) someone else can come and make their contribution. I would like to 
establish a tradition, something that is ongoing. . . . We have to stop doing 
these one-shot deals. I want it to be something that is continuous." 
</P>
<P>
 Like many local artists who have been lured by shimmering prospects only to 
find those streams quickly dry up, Arce echoes similar concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 "If this series happens again, and I'm invited again," she says, "then we can 
sing victory. But in order for any change to occur, only commitment leads to 
true action. So I hope so . . . but let's see."

 W hat would the guys in the suit crowd wear if they allowed themselves to be 
dressed by pros? That question gets answered every year at Gentlemen's 
Haberdashery, a benefit fashion show for the Heart of Jesus Retreat Center in 
Santa Ana that grabs up a bunch of actual local captains of business and 
industry (and in some cases, their sons), stuffs them into some of the finer 
threads from men's shops and parades them down a runway before the eyes of 
several dozen women.  
</P>
<P>
 We went along to watch The Suits perform in their unnatural habitat.  
</P>
<P>
 HE: They strayed from the day-to-day corporate armor, true, but in one sense 
they kept their conservative credentials. You couldn't see any of the guys in 
anything that looked like prole gear. Denim was apparently considered pretty 
radical (and the few examples that did appear were finely tailored and 
pressed), and not one outfit that came down that runway was going to cause the 
slightest ripple of comment on the trendy nightclub circuit. 
</P>
<P>
 Having said that, let me add that I liked most of the stuff. The suits, 
particularly, were a world away from business as usual: a broad variety of 
fabrics, textures, colors and cuts, none of which could have been called common 
in the board room. I suppose it's too much to hope for that outfits like those 
will elbow their way into the corporate culture, but seeing them on actual 
Company Men was refreshing. 
</P>
<P>
 SHE: For me, the best part was watching the women watch the men. I don't think 
I realized how much women love to see their men decked out until that day. They 
whistled when the guys looked sexy. Howled when they did the smallest antic. 
Applauded when they struck a pose. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, it occurred to me that each man had been outfitted very carefully, with 
color and clothing style chosen specifically for their skin tone, hair color 
and body type. No wonder the women went wild. 
</P>
<P>
 The men -- who included business leaders such as Antonio Cagnolo, Stanley 
Pawlowski, Larry Hoffman and Thomas Wilck -- never looked so dapper. Before the 
show, Pawlowski, an Anaheim banker, said he loved the variety of color 
displayed that was going to be shown on the ramp. "(Designers) have gotten away 
from the blacks and grays and into colors, which I like. They give me a lift." 
</P>
<P>
 HE: Well, sure. And wouldn't it be wonderful if more guys in the glass towers 
had the brass to dress like that all the time? But in some quarters, giving up 
the monochromatic corporate uniform is thought to be a sign of frivolity or, 
worse, weakness. So don't hold your breath. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, some of the more casual clothes were spiffy. There were some nice, 
understated golf duds and some terrific textured sweaters that were colorful 
without screaming. 
</P>
<P>
 There was one item that appeared a few times that made me crazy, though: 
saddle oxfords. There is only one place a man can wear saddle oxfords and not 
look goofy, and that's on the golf course. And the shoes had better have spikes 
on the soles. Apart from that, saddle oxfords are the cloddiest shoes on earth. 
They make grown men look like Buster Brown, and their sex appeal registers in 
negative exponential numbers. 
</P>
<P>
 SHE: Saddle oxfords are hot. I think they're a super resort look, especially 
if they're white on white. Great for loafing around the desert or strolling on 
a cruise ship. 
</P>
<P>
 Other now items for men, according to the show's fashion coordinator, Kitty 
Leslie: boldly patterned sweaters, khakis, tinted eyeglasses (shelve those 
contacts), vests (especially over T-shirts and under ultra-casual sport coats), 
penny loafers, pastel anything and striped shirts. 
</P>
<P>
 HE: Sounds like it all falls nicely around the inventories of the stores whose 
names kept getting repeated during the show: POSH, At-Ease, Gary's & Co., 
Nautica and that wild, wacky, zany bastion of hip, Brooks Brothers. None of 
these clothes are exactly cutting-edge, but then they weren't really designed 
to be. I like these stores a lot because, for the most part, their stock 
corresponds to my tastes, which are those of a relatively conservative 
41-year-old Southern Californian. 
</P>
<P>
 The fact that penny loafers and khaki are being talked about as hot fashion 
trends bears this out. When did you last see a high school kid in a pair of 
Bass Weejuns? 
</P>
<P>
 SHE: For most of the men on the ramp, business suits make up the largest part 
of their fashion inventories. Cagnolo, who owns Antonello restaurant, confessed 
to owning 25 suits, "mostly in green and blue shades," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Larry Hoffman admitted to having 40 suits, including several tuxes. A resident 
of Newport Beach, he keeps most them in a storage unit in Costa Mesa. "I live 
in a small house at the beach," he said. "A storage unit comes in real handy."

 Warmer climes mean less of everything -- even footwear. The most flattering of 
heeled looks is the banded model, like Liz Claiborne's ($69). A slight lift at 
the sole and a solid heel anchors the airy top. "It works well with 
deconstructive, sheer clothing, as well as flared trousers," notes spokeswoman 
Phyllis Cerrato. In lino leather, the shoe has the look of linen but is less 
likely to perish, she adds. Available in nutmeg, navy and black, it also comes 
in metallic in smoother napa leather.

 Another Chance 
</P>
<P>
 Fans of Comme de Garcons who only admired from afar will have a better chance 
of enjoying the progressive Japanese label with the debut of a secondary line. 
The collection of simple, snug-fitting dresses, sweaters and skirts carries the 
trademark unconstructed feel, says Roman Alonso, a spokesman for Barneys New 
York. "These looks are a bit more accessible, but they still carry the Comme de 
Garcons look." Pieces run about $200 -- less than half what it could cost for a 
basic couture item. 
</P>
<P>
 Match of the Day

 While everyone has rushed out renditions of athletic-inspired streetwear with 
Adidas-style racing stripes, K.P. Productions comes out ahead with its salute 
to the World Cup. It seems the San Francisco label already played the track 
look last year. Cut of the same nylon mesh used for jerseys, the 
soccer-inspired collection "is just a progression on the sports idea," says 
designer Keri White. "We've had a brilliant response." The football frocks and 
unisex tops and pants were a natural for the British immigrant, who did some 
kicking of her own as a girl. Choose your own team colors: red, green, yellow, 
blue, black or silver.

TODAY'S COLLECTIBLES WERE ONCE A THRONE'S STONE AWAY; A GOOD IMITATION CAN BE A 
REAL GEM TO FRIENDS OF FAUX AND OTHER COSTUME JEWELRY

 A Madame Gripoix necklace made in the 1960s and sold for less than $100 went 
for $1,955 recently at a New York auction. Does it contain pearls and diamonds? 
No. It has imitation gems: five strands of emerald glass beads with small 
rhinestone beads and a medallion of rhinestones and emerald glass. 
</P>
<P>
 Why so much for costume jewelry? 
</P>
<P>
 One reason is that it came from designer Gripoix, who worked with couture 
houses to accessorize their pricey clothes. 
</P>
<P>
 Another reason is that the costume jewelry made between the 1920s and the 
1960s was created in much the same way as fine jewelry. Large, sparkling 
rhinestones and glittering faux gems and pearls allowed designers -- who also 
often worked in precious stones for more expensive pieces -- more room to be 
creative. 
</P>
<P>
 Collectors are searching for pieces that are valued because of their design 
and history. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Costume jewelry has a long, glittering history.  
</P>
<P>
 Methods of producing simulated precious gems are mentioned in the writings of 
Pliny the Elder in the First Century. A French government edict of 1331 made it 
illegal for members of the French goldsmith guild to create artificial precious 
gems because it was considered counterfeiting. Breaking the law resulted in 
flogging or banishment. 
</P>
<P>
 In 15th-Century Europe, only the royal family, nobles and clergy were allowed 
to wear gold, silver, precious gems or pearls because they symbolized power and 
high social standing. Others could not possess genuine or faux adornments. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't until the 1650s, when the first factory to produce imitation stones 
in great numbers was built in Paris, that the old laws were set aside 
completely. 
</P>
<P>
 Often costume jewelry was a copy of an authentic precious piece. Look-alikes 
were made to deter theft. 
</P>
<P>
 In the late 1920s, however, designers stopped making fakes to look like 
jewelry from Tiffany, Cartier and Van Cleef & Arpels, and started creating 
original pieces from non-precious materials. The material shortages during the 
Depression and World War II initially gave them impetus. But later, costume 
jewelry designers broke away and made pieces that were bolder, livelier and 
brighter than their more expensive cousins. (Coco Chanel is credited with 
coining the term "costume jewelry" since she and other apparel designers 
preferred creating faux bijoux to complement the look of specific outfits.) 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the designs made for top fashion houses such as Chanel, Hattie 
Carnegie and Schiaparelli, upscale costume pieces were made by Miriam Haskell, 
Eisenberg and Trifari in the '30 and '40s. Mass-market lines, such as Coro, 
Napier and Weiss, proliferated from the '50s to today. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 With fabulous fakes selling for hundreds and thousands of dollars now, is it 
too late to start a collection? No. Most people don't think of costume jewelry 
as a great craft, and there are plenty of antique shops, flea markets and 
auctions where pieces can be found at reasonable prices. 
</P>
<P>
 One such place is Antiques 4 U at 312 N. Newport Blvd., Newport Beach ((714) 
548-4123). Prices range from $19 for whimsical pieces made from metals, 
plastics and ceramics to $200 for a highly collectible necklace by Miriam 
Haskell. There are Eisenberg rhinestone brooches and Trifari necklaces starting 
at $90. 
</P>
<P>
 "A piece is worth what you get for it," said Nina Khodorovsky, owner of 
Antiques 4 U. "I have collectors who will buy any jewelry by Miriam Haskell 
over the phone without even seeing it." 
</P>
<P>
 What do you look for in a piece of vintage costume jewelry? 
</P>
<P>
 The most important element is a good, strong design. It should be detailed, 
extravagant and glamorous. 
</P>
<P>
 Make sure the stones are prong-set, not glued, and that each stone is in place 
with no obvious repairs. Each pearl in a necklace should be individually 
knotted. Movable parts on a brooch or necklace are important and add to the 
value. Turn the piece over to check for joints and open-back settings, since 
they indicate craftsmanship. 
</P>
<P>
 Signed works often go for more, but not always. 
</P>
<P>
 There are many different styles and colors to chose from, because well-dressed 
women 50 years ago usually wore a full ensemble of jewelry in a particular 
style: a matching necklace, brooch, bracelet and earrings. 
</P>
<P>
 Dress clips were also popular in the '30s, when women wore collarless 
necklines. These matching brooches could be pinned on either side of the 
neckline, or, if the backs were convertible, worn as earrings or shoe buckles. 
</P>
<P>
 Brooches were really the signature pieces. They often represented figures of 
flowers, fruit, flags, crowns, birds, animals, fish and insects. Sometimes the 
pieces were full of rhinestones (often set in sterling silver); others had faux 
stones in every color of the rainbow made out of glass as well as plastic. 
</P>
<P>
 All were made well. Pieces were assembled by hand, with each fitting hinged 
with complex joints. 
</P>
<P>
 Local collectors may have bought the pieces themselves -- Betty Moss, director 
of the Business Committee for the Arts, has a Haskell brooch and earring set -- 
or have received them as a gift -- Electa Anderson of Roger's Gardens in 
Newport Beach received Eisenberg pieces from her mother and grandmother. 
</P>
<P>
 For the neophyte collector of vintage costume jewelry, it's not too late to 
begin. 
</P>
<P>
 Rummage through shoe boxes in relatives' houses and check antique stores and 
garage sales for a rare, well-designed piece. You may have a story to tell like 
the one of a dealer who sold a Madame Gripoix faux pearl and glass diamond 
necklace at 6 a.m. for $80. In the next hour, another dealer bought it for 
$450. By the end of the day, it was going for $1,500. 
</P>
<P>

FAUX PAS REPORT: AS TIMES CHANGE, IT GETS EASIER TO WATCH YOURSELF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN MORELL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>

<P>
 Staid traditionalism seems to be less of an influence in fashion every day. 
Take the case of the wristwatch. Since grandfather turned in his old pocket 
timepiece for a watch, the unspoken rule was that when a man was wearing a suit 
or tux, the watch had to have a black or brown leather band and the face had to 
be dressy. 
</P>
<P>
 But the popularity of the sporty style Rolex and Tag Heure's has changed the 
equation. A hunky, blue-blood sport watch can be just as acceptable as a dress 
watch in a traditional situation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many manufacturers are using stainless steel and 18-karat gold together, 
which makes a watch both sporty and dressy," says Barbara Martinez of Shreve & 
Co. Jewelers in South Coast Plaza, Costa Mesa. "However, you'll still want to 
stay away from the fad watches. Anything with a plastic band isn't OK for dress 
wear." 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever your wrist wear, it's a good idea to look it over and clean it up 
every few months. 
</P>
<P>
 "Your watch can reveal how detail-oriented you are," Martinez says. "If yours 
is dirty with a worn-out band, that tells others something about your 
character." 
</P>
<P>
 A little jewelry: Still have those small pendants, tiny hearts and flowered 
rings -- that little-girl and preteen jewelry that's been sitting in a dusty 
drawer for years? If you're daring enough, you can join the thousands of other 
women who have started wearing their little-girl jewelry again. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lots of people can get away with it, as long as they don't overdo the look," 
says Johanna Perdaems of Vogue Alley in Laguna Niguel. "Mix it with some of 
your adult jewelry, and take a good look in the mirror to see if it's right." 
</P>
<P>
 You may need to move some things around. That little heart pendant you got in 
sixth grade may look better as part of a bracelet now, or as part of a charm 
bracelet with other young-miss gifts. 
</P>
<P>
 Hang'em high: A nice suit or sport coat is expensive, so why do so many guys 
remove their jackets and toss them over chairs, giving the coats strange folds 
and creases? 
</P>
<P>
 "If you're going to take off your jacket, the ideal situation would be to put 
it on a coat hanger," says Bill Snyder of Posh Gentlemen's Clothing in Newport 
Beach. "If you have to put it on a chair, be careful about how it's resting." 
</P>
<P>
 If you have a tall, straight-backed dining room chair, hanging a jacket from 
end to end could easily stretch it out. Fold it carefully in half across the 
top of the chair. However, if you're sitting on a rounded-back chair, it 
probably won't do any harm to hang your jacket on the back.

 About four Gs of fashion pressure are bearing down on the Lakers new head 
coach, Earvin (Magic) Johnson, thanks to his onetime boss. Former Laker and now 
Knicks coach Pat Riley set a style precedent with hair that looked as if it 
were raked by International Harvester and Giorgio Armani suits that couldn't 
ask for a better fit model. 
</P>
<P>
 Since his first press conference as coach -- at which he wore an ivory jacket, 
white shirt and pink and black polka-dotted tie -- Johnson clearly has had a 
style plan. His initial court-side appearances have been in dark suits with 
white shirts ( very conservative ) and eye-popping geometric-print ties ( not 
conservative ). 
</P>
<P>
 Highlights include: 
</P>
<P>
 Game 1. A gray chalk-stripe suit, black tie with polka dots and pink squares. 
Score: Los Angeles 110, Milwaukee 101. 
</P>
<P>
 Game 2. A blue-gray suit with shawl-collar lapel, black tie with pink circles 
and fat blue lightning bolts. Score: Los Angeles 91, Minnesota 89. 
</P>
<P>
 Game 3. A dark gray suit, black tie with large white polka dots (no pink). 
Score: Lakers lose to Seattle, 92 to 95.

 If Johnson's fashion style is rambunctious, so is his coaching. Watching him 
try to contain himself to the sidelines is almost as exciting as his old fast 
break. Although Johnson doesn't have a wardrobe contract, a Laker 
representative says, he can expect an avalanche of offers -- if he stays on the 
job. GAILE ROBINSON

FORMS OF FLATTERY 
</P>

 What ever happened to pretty clothes? It seems a silly question, but women are 
asking it -- seriously. After years of designer labels inspired by street 
fashions -- from oversize hip-hop jeans to grunge wear tied up in plaid flannel 
shirts -- tracking down a foolproof, flattering outfit may be the hardest thing 
to do. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even I can't find anything," says California designer Elliette Ellis, who 
makes special occasion dresses under her Miss Elliette label. "Most women are 
dying to buy something new, and they have the money. But they're frustrated 
because they don't see anything beautiful that they really want to own." 
</P>
<P>
 Ellis, who started her business in 1947, adds: "I'm from the old school. To 
me, pretty means soft, flowing clothes, not hard leather with nailheads, and 
not denim." 
</P>
<P>
 A lot of women in their 30s and 40s might well agree. Just because they may 
have the body to dress like a 22-year-old doesn't mean they have a mind to. 
Waifish dresses that look like lingerie and "baby" T-shirts that bare 
everything from midriff to hips aren't exactly what a mother of three might 
want to wear to the market. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, women who wish for something more flattering could have a problem. It's 
been so long since anybody even mentioned pretty in relation to clothes, it's 
hard to say what pretty clothes means. 
</P>
<P>
 One thing is certain: It doesn't mean what it once did. Think of the women who 
set the standard, back when pretty got more respect. It wasn't that long ago. 
For Grace Kelly, Elizabeth Taylor and Ava Gardner, pretty meant waist-squeezing 
dresses, stockings and high heels, girdles, full slips, short white gloves. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most women today want to be less done-up," notes fashion director Denise C. 
Scher of the California Mart. "Maybe their interpretation of pretty is 
simplified. It doesn't necessarily mean fluff." 
</P>
<P>
 As part of her job, Scher coordinates fashion shows that capture the 
California style. She says contemporary California designers known for their 
feminine collections rely on two key ingredients: relaxed shapes and soft 
colors. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles designer David Dart says Calvin Klein set the modern standard with 
unusual colors and clean shapes. "Color has changed the definition of pretty. 
Casual is important. Anything contrived isn't pretty." 
</P>
<P>
 Among famous examples of classically pretty women, Sharon Stone and Michelle 
Pfeiffer stand out because they dress the part. And they make it modern. 
Pfeiffer practically lives in pastel Giorgio Armani pantsuits and flat-heel 
shoes. Stone has a closet filled with Valentino evening dresses. No ruffles; 
she wears graceful, fluid shapes. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 The dearth of pretty has to do with a long forgotten fact. As women began 
steaming toward the top in the business world, they often decided that dressing 
pretty didn't work in their favor. That was the '70s and '80s, but the thinking 
still holds. "Women in business don't want to be considered pretty -- they want 
to be seen as competent," says Joan Kaner, fashion director of Neiman Marcus. 
Particularly among younger women, she finds, "pretty isn't uppermost in their 
minds." 
</P>
<P>
 What is? 
</P>
<P>
 "Getting ahead." 
</P>
<P>
 In other words, updating the idea of how to dress pretty requires getting past 
the days when fewer working women aimed at the executive heights. Most women 
have figured it out: Dressing like a man doesn't guarantee you'll get the 
respect a man gets. 
</P>
<P>
 If soft shapes and soft colors are the winning combination now, fabric can 
only help get the message across. Fluid chiffon, silk crepe and wool jersey are 
most designers' top choices for pretty clothing. Floral prints, brocades and 
glimmering satins also achieve the look. Their built-in softness contradicts 
the thicker, harder-finished menswear fabrics so prevalent in women's fashion 
for the past 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Fabrics are the real foundation of dressing pretty, Shauna Stein says. In her 
Los Angeles boutique, she carries designer labels along with her own small 
collection. Stein's spring line features pastel-print chiffon dresses and 
shirts, as well as skirts with lace insets. 
</P>
<P>
 "I started my store with pretty clothes as my concept," she says. "I find you 
can pull a pretty look together, no matter what's out there." The latest trends 
haven't made it easy, she admits: "Sporty clothes don't fit into the pretty 
category. And tractor-tread shoes kill the look." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 No matter where the fads and trends take fashion, women can always count on 
certain items if dressing pretty is the goal.  
</P>
<P>
 Stein offers jackets and suits in curvaceous shapes, and bias-cut skirts that 
wrap the body and flare at the hem, for a flow not found in straight cuts. 
Mixing a structured suit with a soft blouse or a delicate shoe can redirect a 
wardrobe, from harder-edged chic toward flat-out feminine. "Just one item can 
make an outfit pretty," Stein says. 
</P>
<P>
 We aren't headed back toward dressing the way Grace and Ava did. "But I do 
think we're going back to femininity," Kaner says. "And feminine emphasizes all 
of a women's positives." 
</P>
<P>
 Isn't that what it's really all about?

STUDY FINDS MOST CHILD CARE LACKING; FAMILY: OF CHILDREN CARED FOR IN SOMEONE 
ELSE'S HOME, 56% OF THE PROVIDERS WERE CALLED ONLY ADEQUATE. ANOTHER 35% WERE 
RATED AS INADEQUATE.

<P>
 The nation's most prevalent form of day care for young children of employed 
mothers has received unimpressive marks in the topic's first major study in 
more than a decade. 
</P>
<P>
 Of child care that takes place in someone else's home -- called family child 
care -- in a five-year study released Thursday by the New York City-based 
Families and Work Institute. The study was funded by groups that included the 
Annenberg Foundation, the Carnegie Corp. of New York, Dayton-Hudson Foundation, 
Mervyn's and Target stores. 
</P>
<P>
 Only 9% of the 226 care providers examined in the San Fernando Valley, 
Dallas-Ft. Worth and Charlotte, N.C., were ranked as good, meaning conducive to 
the growth and development of a child. Fifty-six percent of the home providers 
in the study were described as adequate. 
</P>
<P>
 To Ellen Galinsky, who conducted the study for the Families and Work 
Institute, the findings were startling -- and troubling. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once again, we find that although we know how to provide quality child care, 
we still are not doing it," Galinsky said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since this is the foundation of future learning and school success for many 
of our children, it's hard to think that they may not be in a good situation," 
she said. "But many are not." 
</P>
<P>
 Thirty-three percent of U.S. families with employed mothers use child care in 
someone else's home for children under 5. In nearly two-thirds of these cases, 
the provider is not related to the child. 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, 28% of U.S. children under age 5 with working mothers are cared 
for in child-care centers. 
</P>
<P>
 The survey of 820 mothers and their children also revealed that: 
</P>
<P>
 * Only half of the children felt securely attached to their providers. 
Surprisingly, children were not more likely to be securely attached to 
providers who are relatives than to non-relatives. 
</P>
<P>
 * Of the parents who looked for alternatives when selecting care, 65% believed 
that they had no choices. Twenty-eight percent of the mothers in this sample 
said they would use other care if it were available. 
</P>
<P>
 * Children from low-income homes are in lower-quality care than their 
higher-income counterparts. 
</P>
<P>
 * Children from minority families are in somewhat lower-quality care than 
"non-minority" children. 
</P>
<P>
 Care in the home of a provider breaks down into homes that charge for care and 
where the providers have received a state license, and homes where the 
providers are not regulated and are not related to the child or children. The 
Families and Work Institute study found that most were non-regulated because 
they had more children than rules allow. Ninety-six percent of these providers 
charged for child care. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Non-regulated relatives who provide care make up a third category, with 52% of 
these providers charging for their services. Related providers averaged 52.9 
years of age, as opposed to an average age of 40.5 for regulated non-related 
providers. Related providers also had significantly less education and lower 
family incomes than regulated providers. 
</P>
<P>
 Carollee Howes, a professor of education at UCLA who worked on the study, said 
many of these relative care providers were working on an ad-hoc basis, 
sometimes reluctantly filling a need for a working family member -- and not 
necessarily taking pride or pleasure in what they were doing.  
</P>
<P>
 Many of these caregivers lacked training as well as what the study termed 
"intentionality," or a purposeful "commitment to create home environments in 
which children can be nurtured and can learn." 
</P>
<P>
 Howes said the report showed that these arrangements are often vastly less 
satisfactory than might have been assumed. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have this idea that family-based child care can take up the slack," she 
said. "We just blithely assume that it's there, and it's fine -- when in fact 
it's very heterogeneous, and not all of it is fine." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 One positive outcome of the study, Galinsky said, was to ascertain "a working 
definition of quality " in child care that came from parents and practitioners 
alike. Galinsky said that across ethnic, income and geographic lines, parents 
and providers agreed that "a warm and attentive relationship" between provider 
and child was the key to quality care. 
</P>
<P>
 In evaluating quality, parents and providers also placed significance on the 
child's safety and on the providers' and parents' communication about the 
child. 
</P>
<P>
 "It comes down to someone who cares about your child, and someone your child 
cares about," Galinsky said. 
</P>
<P>
 But she added that while "it has been an assumption that because care is in a 
home, it is by definition more caring and more sensitive -- it can be, but it 
is not necessarily that way. Just like center care, it is variable."

STICKER SHOCK; USC SAFETY STAFF SLAPS WARNINGS ON ITEMS AT RISK OF BEING STOLEN 
</P>

 They stuck it to Juanita Castillo when they found her office unlocked at USC. 
</P>
<P>
 "Gotcha!" read the orange stickers pasted on her computer screen and printer 
and attached to her key ring and wallet inside her top desk drawer. 
</P>
<P>
 "You could have been ripped off -- Secure Your Property!" explained the back 
side of the removable labels. 
</P>
<P>
 "Gotcha," campus safety officer Gerald Baker said to Castillo, manager of a 
university cafeteria. "Your door was open. Anybody could have walked in and 
taken your stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 Baker and partner Don Thomas were on an unusual patrol -- walking through 
buildings and slapping stickers on bicycles, backpacks, purses and other 
property left unattended at the school south of Downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The stickers are a reminder that thieves can walk off with valuables while 
owners aren't looking. Hundreds of the labels have been distributed in an 
awareness program launched this week. 
</P>
<P>
 They are a jolt to some. An insult to others. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was watching my office," Castillo protested. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were here four minutes before you walked up," Thomas replied. 
</P>
<P>
 Across the lunchroom, Baker pasted "Gotchas" on three backpacks abandoned on a 
corner table. Freshmen Peggy Han, Jason DaCosta and Karen Suh, all 19, were 
surprised when they returned with their food. 
</P>
<P>
 Han said her pack contained nothing of value. But Suh cringed at her sticker: 
"My wallet's inside. And my car keys. I'm going to be more careful," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 DaCosta sheepishly checked to make certain his books, calculator, sunglasses 
and keys were still inside. "My friends think these stickers are so lame. But 
I'd have to say it's a good program," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the nearby library reading room, senior David Taghioff, 22, watched 
belongings left by another student in a study cubicle get tagged. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never considered security until I got ripped off two semesters ago," 
Taghioff said. "I got up and went 20 feet to throw something away and I lost a 
$38 book. People just don't think -- I've seen people leave their laptop 
computers on the tables here and walk away for 10 or 15 minutes." 
</P>
<P>
 Outside, the officers spied a university golf cart parked on a busy sidewalk. 
Loaded in back were a television set and VCR. 
</P>
<P>
 Driver Ashanti Luke, 19, a sophomore and part-time campus employee, was 
apologetic when he returned to find warnings plastered to the cart and its 
cargo. 
</P>
<P>
 Campus security Lt. Mike Kennedy said 7,500 "Gotchas" have been printed. His 
officers will continue distributing them until the supply runs out. 
</P>
<P>
 That may not take long. That's because USC counted 2,059 thefts last year -- 
up 10% over 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 To a security officer, statistics like those getcha.

RLA HELPS COMPTON FIRM LAND CONTRACT; BUSINESS: $7-MILLION DEAL WITH THREE 
PHONE COMPANIES IS A LIFESAVER FOR MINORITY-OWNED CONTRACTOR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A few months ago, the Alameda Group, a Compton-based minority contractor that 
once had a sound business assembling sections of jet airliner frames, was down 
to rewiring electric motors for elevator shafts, oil-well pumps and escalators. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were about to fold," company President Vernal Claiborne said Thursday, 
until a deal that could generate up to $7 million in two years came through 
with three telecommunications giants -- A T& T, Pacific Bell and 
GTE-California. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, officials of RLA's new leadership team touted the agreement at 
their first news conference. The deal calls for Claiborne's employees to 
assemble remote maintenance testing units, solid-state protectors and coiled 
copper wire for use in switching offices. 
</P>
<P>
 The deal represents an "innovative collaboration" between major corporations 
and small minority-owned businesses, the type that the post-riot revitalization 
agency is seeking to generate in neglected neighborhoods across Los Angeles, 
said RLA President Linda Griego. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a prime example of what we are trying to do now with RLA, and that is 
to maintain and expand small minority-owned businesses and to do that with the 
help of larger companies," added RLA board Chairman Lodwrick M. Cook, chief 
executive officer of Arco. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the agreement also makes abundantly clear just how difficult it is to 
lure new business to small, inner-city firms. 
</P>
<P>
 All parties at the news conference were quick to acknowledge that the decision 
by the phone firms to enter into a partnership with a minority-owned Los 
Angeles County contractor came about only because of the persistence of RLA 
board member Patricia M. Eckert, who also happens to be a member of the state 
Public Utilities Commission, which regulates Pacific Bell and GTE-California.  
</P>
<P>
 "I had to kick tail to get the (utilities) to do this," she acknowledged after 
the news conference. "As a regulator, they tend to be a little more open to 
your ideas, if you know what I mean." 
</P>
<P>
 The deal helps Pacific Bell and GTE-California meet state-mandated goals that 
15% of their contracts with outside vendors go to minority-owned businesses. 
Minority contractors generally do not have similar leverage because most major 
companies not regulated as utilities do not have to meet such mandates. 
</P>
<P>
 Eckert said that shortly after RLA was formed in the wake of the 1992 riots, 
then-RLA Chairman Peter Ueberroth urged each of the agency's 80 board members 
to use their influence to arrange at least one deal to bring new business to 
impoverished neighborhoods. Eckert said she proceeded to lobby with executives 
of the telecommunications companies to set up a partnership with a 
minority-owned Los Angeles business. 
</P>
<P>
 The companies agreed and Alameda, based in an industrial park at the 
Lynwood-Compton city line, was selected from among more than 100 women- and 
minority-run businesses that applied, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives of the phone firms stressed that they undertook the 
partnership because it appears profitable. "This is simply something that makes 
a lot of sense and has a good feeling to it," said Pacific Bell Vice President 
of External Affairs E.H. (Gene) Sherman. 
</P>
<P>
 Claiborne, whose work force has fallen to as low as 13 from a peak of 105, 
said five employees earning from $7 to $15 an hour have begun assembling A T& T 
components into the products for sale to Pacific Bell and GTE-California. He 
said he hopes to increase sales over time in order to hire more workers to 
supplement his aerospace assembly business, which has started to stabilize in 
recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "This," he said, "will help us start back up and revitalize the community." 
</P>
<P>
 Claiborne, an African American who lives in Torrance, said most of his mainly 
Latino 25-member work force resides within five miles of the firm's 
headquarters.

SWAT OR NOT?; OFFICER WHO REALIZED HER DREAM OF JOINING LAPD'S ELITE SAYS OFFER 
MAY BE TOO LITTLE, TOO LATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM NEWTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 From the day the Special Weapons and Tactics officers visited her class at the 
Police Academy in 1983, Nina Damianakes says, she set her sights on joining 
their ranks. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The officers who came to the academy that afternoon emphasized the deep 
seriousness of SWAT's mission: No unit is more important to the LAPD, and none 
requires more of its officers. The training is intense and constant. At SWAT, 
any failure, no matter how small, can leave a person dead. 
</P>
<P>
 Damianakes, a driven young officer fresh out of college, was deeply impressed, 
and she says that from that moment on she dedicated her career to becoming a 
part of the LAPD's most elite cadre. History did not favor her chances: Since 
the unit was created in the early 1970s, the 60-officer contingent has never 
included a woman. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I came on the job, I realized it was mostly a man's Police Department," 
she said in an interview last week. "But I've always been able to prove myself. 
. . . I was not going to be denied." 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, she put off having children, passed up opportunities for 
promotions and turned down offers to accept other prestigious assignments. Now 
-- 11 years, two rigorous tests and two lawsuits later -- Damianakes may soon 
see her goal fulfilled. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, the LAPD acknowledged problems with its SWAT testing procedures 
and ruled in favor of Damianakes' grievance against the department, finding 
that she did indeed deserve a place in SWAT. 
</P>
<P>
 As of Thursday, Damiankes, 34, was still debating whether to accept the city's 
offer. She said a doctor who has been seeing her for stress has advised her 
against joining SWAT right away. And though she is pleased to see the LAPD 
acknowledge problems with the evaluation of the tests, she remains angered by 
the entire experience. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sure, it's tempting," Damianakes said of the LAPD offer. "However, it's too 
little, too late." 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever Damianakes decides, the mere offer of a job in SWAT sets her apart 
from every female officer who has gone before her. And it reflects a career in 
which she has risen to some of the LAPD's most prestigious positions, winning 
the praise of colleagues and supervisors -- and even persuading her 
once-skeptical husband, self-described "good ol' boy" and fellow Metro officer 
Mike Damianakes, that women do belong in the LAPD's most challenging jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Not everyone agrees that SWAT should have welcomed Nina Damianakes. Thursday, 
a number of SWAT officers grumbled that the department was making a mistake by 
caving in to her complaints, privately grousing that the move would dilute 
SWAT's historically challenging entrance requirements and could even endanger 
the safety of SWAT officers. 
</P>
<P>
 But even among many of those who stand by the SWAT testing procedures, there 
is widespread praise for Damianakes, a former college athlete who exercises 
rigorously. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's one of the finest police officers I know," said former Chief Daryl F. 
Gates, whose security contingent included Damianakes for a time. "She's a 
top-notch athlete, a top-notch police officer, a top-notch person." 
</P>
<P>
 Damianakes' personnel evaluations, copies of which were obtained by The Times, 
echo that praise. 
</P>
<P>
 "Damianakes' work performance during this rating period can only be classified 
as outstanding," her supervisors wrote in 1991. "She has continued to complete 
all of her assigned duties in an exemplary manner." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992 and 1993, the reports were equally glowing: "Officer Damianakes is a 
self-starter requiring a minimal amount of supervision. She is a highly 
competent police officer who conveys a very positive professional image. . . . 
Nina is a definite asset to Metropolitan Division and the department." 
</P>
<P>
 In every evaluation, Damianakes' supervisors noted her determination to join 
SWAT, and they encouraged her to apply. Several added that they felt she would 
make the unit. 
</P>
<P>
 As Damianakes well knew, however, outstanding ratings are not enough to open 
the door to SWAT. SWAT's requirements are the highest and most strictly 
maintained in the LAPD. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, there's a saying at the LAPD: "Only the best make Metro. And only 
the best in Metro make SWAT." In the history of the department, only one other 
woman has been deemed qualified to take the SWAT test. 
</P>
<P>
 So when Damianakes was selected from the Metro ranks as one of 20 officers 
authorized to participate in a 1990 SWAT test, she launched herself on an 
intense training regimen. Some nights, she said, she awoke in a panic that she 
had skipped one of her exercises. She would elbow her husband, and the two of 
them would pile out of bed to do sit-ups. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time the test rolled around, she was convinced that she was ready. 
</P>
<P>
 She and her fellow SWAT candidates endured a grueling five-day test, most of 
which took place at Camp Pendleton and which demanded that the candidates 
rappel, shoot, run an obstacle course and complete a complicated land 
navigation course, among other things. At the end, Damianakes returned home 
bruised, cut, exhausted -- and confident that she had earned a spot. 
</P>
<P>
 Too nervous to call for the results herself, she asked her husband to check 
for her. 
</P>
<P>
 "I could tell from the sound of his voice that I hadn't made it," she said, 
her voice quaking slightly at the memory. "I couldn't believe it." 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Damianakes was not as surprised. He admits that he believed in officers 
paying their dues -- even if they were unfairly turned down for jobs they 
deserved. "I feel kind of like a jerk buying into the system all those years," 
he said. "I did." 
</P>
<P>
 Although stunned to have been passed over, Nina Damianakes said she did not 
sulk over the 1990 rejection. 
</P>
<P>
 "We went for a long run the next day," Mike Damianakes said. 
</P>
<P>
 "To get ready for the next time," Nina Damianakes added. 
</P>
<P>
 But she fared no better when she retook the test in 1993. That time, according 
to LAPD officials, she ranked 19th out of 20 in her group. 
</P>
<P>
 Nina Damianakes never complained the test was unfair, never suggested women be 
judged by a different standard. She maintains she excelled on the test but was 
marked down simply because she is a woman. "I do not want SWAT to change 
anything about what they do," she said. "I just want to be judged fairly, and I 
wasn't." 
</P>
<P>
 Until this week, the department disagreed. But in granting her grievance, the 
LAPD acknowledged that there were problems with the test it administered. It 
did not find that she had been discriminated against, but it did acknowledge 
that some aspects of its tests were "insufficiently job-related and possibly 
(have) a disparate impact on female candidates." Future tests were suspended, 
at least until test researchers can study them and determine whether they are 
fair. And Damianakes, after 11 years of hoping and three years of testing, was 
offered the spot she says she always wanted. 
</P>
<P>
 In her view, though, the department has not gone far enough. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're still not admitting that there was gender bias in my case," she said. 
"I completed everything. I did anything they asked, I completed every 
requirement, and I still was denied a position."

PEPPER SPRAY PROVING TO BE A HOT PRODUCT; PROTECTION: BUSINESS IS BRISK AT 
STORES THAT SELL THE SELF-DEFENSE ITEM. BUYERS ARE CROWDING CERTIFICATION 
CLASSES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 For Rodney Ward it was the murder of the two Japanese students in San Pedro. 
For Patricia Ortiz it was the long walk to a dark parking lot after a night 
class at a community college. For Deborah Butler it was the moment two men 
flashed gang signs at her as she was walking her dogs after work. 
</P>
<P>
 All were precipitating incidents, minor traumas that reminded them of how 
vulnerable they are alone, at night, unarmed. None of them feel comfortable 
with guns, but they wanted some measure of protection, something to at least 
clutch as they walk from work to their cars, or through a dark parking lot, or 
down their driveways at night as they lug their garbage cans. 
</P>
<P>
 So Ward, Ortiz and Butler signed up for the pepper spray class at Long Beach 
Uniform Co., which has been training and certifying more than 40 people a day 
since March 1, when the state authorized dealers to make the spray available to 
citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 When the state first announced that the spray was legal in California, there 
was a period of frenzy and confusion. Many stores waited days for their 
shipments from the distributor. Others waited for state workers to inspect 
their businesses and authorize them to sell the product. 
</P>
<P>
 But now about 200 sporting goods stores and gun shops are selling the spray, 
with only about 35 still waiting for their applications to be processed, and 
the demand remains strong. About 30,000 canisters of the spray were sold in the 
first month, according to estimates by distributors. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are relieved they can finally buy the stuff," said David Bateman, an 
owner of Bateman Brothers & Co., a gun and sporting goods store in Hollywood. 
"The first few days people were almost in a panic. . . . They wanted the spray, 
it was finally legal to buy it, but they couldn't find anybody who was selling 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 Pepper spray, whose scientific name is oleoresin capsicum, is a pepper extract 
in an oil base that sticks to the eyes, nose and mouth. It has a blinding and 
choking effect and overpowers most people with a burning sensation that makes 
breathing difficult.  
</P>
<P>
 There have been a few incidents of the spray being accidentally discharged in 
public places during the past month, but no reports of serious injury. Still, 
the American Civil Liberties Union has criticized the state for making the 
spray available to the public, saying more research is needed on its safety and 
reliability. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are too many unanswered questions at this point," said Southern 
California ACLU spokesman Allan Parachini. "We still don't know if the spray is 
reliable on people who are high on drugs or an in a psychiatric crisis. If it 
isn't, that's significant information that consumers need to know." 
</P>
<P>
 But at Long Beach Uniform, which also sells handguns, the customers who pour 
in all day, every day, want to obtain their pepper spray first and worry about 
the controversy later. And it is not just individual customers who have deluged 
the store with calls. Dozens of corporations, including banks, hospitals and 
aircraft companies, have set up pepper spray training for their employees. 
</P>
<P>
 The store, one of the largest distributors of the spray in the state, runs 
five training classes a day and draws a wide range of crime-weary residents. On 
a recent day, there were burly security guards obtaining their certification 
alongside pregnant women, businessmen on their lunch breaks and unemployed 
construction workers. A van from a nearby convalescent home whisked six women 
in their late 70s and 80s to the store for the training. One young woman 
brought her aunt to the class on her birthday and bought her the pepper spray 
for a present. 
</P>
<P>
 Dozens of students began signing up for the classes after two Japanese college 
students were shot to death in a San Pedro supermarket parking lot two weeks 
ago, according to Long Beach Uniform employees.  
</P>
<P>
 Rodney Ward, a student at El Camino College, said the shootings have been a 
major topic of conversation at his school. His English teacher devoted a class 
discussion to the killings and assigned the students to write a paper on how 
they would protect themselves if attacked. 
</P>
<P>
 "That killing really woke me up," said Ward, 22, after his pepper spray class. 
"I go to school at night. I shop at night, just like they did. I realized that 
the same thing could happen to me. . . . I'd be afraid to carry a gun. I'd be 
too jumpy. I feel a lot more comfortable with the pepper spray." 
</P>
<P>
 Only one type of pepper spray has been authorized for use in California; it is 
a misdemeanor to carry any of the other brands. The authorized spray comes in a 
yellow canister and is manufactured by Defense Technology Corp. of America. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who want to obtain pepper spray must watch a 30-minute training video or 
take a 30-question test and then demonstrate their ability to use the 
canisters. People who have previously taken a Mace class only have to view a 
10-minute video and then pay a $12 state certification fee to carry the spray; 
all others must pay $17. The cost of the spray is $15 to $20. 
</P>
<P>
 Deborah Butler decided to sign up for the course when she began taking walks 
every night after work. Her husband has a bad back so she is forced to go 
alone, with just her two dogs for protection. 
</P>
<P>
 "The other night I'm walking down the street and a couple guys flash gang 
signs at me. . . . Here I am, a 35-year-old woman and I have to deal with 
that," Butler said. "I need something to carry with me. I don't want to let 
these people run me out of my own neighborhood."

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: ROSEMEAD; BODIES OF 3 
DISCOVERED IN APPARENT MURDER-SUICIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The bodies of an El Monte shoe repair shop owner, his wife and their 
16-month-old son were found in a Rosemead apartment Wednesday night, 
authorities said. It is believed that the man killed his wife and son with a 
handgun before turning the weapon on himself. 
</P>
<P>
 Detectives suspect that the man, identified by the county coroner's office as 
Parviz Parvand, 39, fired the shots after a domestic dispute, said Los Angeles 
County Sheriff's Deputy Angie McLaughlin. Bruises and cuts were found on the 
bodies of Rocio Carmen Parvand, 33, and the boy, Alex Parvand, sheriff's 
detectives told neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 A handgun was found at the scene and detectives believe it was fired by the 
husband, McLaughlin said. The bodies were discovered at about 9:30 p.m. by 
Rocio Parvand's parents, who had dropped by the apartment in the 9400 block of 
Steele Street to visit their daughter, said neighbor Leticia Nieto.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; POLICEMEN 
ACCUSED OF FIRING AT CHP OFFICER TO GO TO TRIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A judge Thursday ordered two Los Angeles policemen to stand trial for 
allegedly firing at a highway patrol officer during a drunken off-duty shooting 
spree on the Harbor Freeway.  
</P>
<P>
 After a two-day preliminary hearing, Municipal Judge Elva Soper refused to 
dismiss any charges against Ted Teyechea and Michael Herrera, who face 14 years 
in prison if convicted of charges stemming from the Feb. 9 incident. 
</P>
<P>
 California Highway Patrol Officer Scott Wall testified that he was on the 
freeway shoulder when he saw what he believed were "Mexican gangbangers" 
shooting at him from a pickup truck. Wall said Teyechea and Herrera, both 30, 
continued to target him as the patrolman chased them on the freeway. The police 
officers contend that they never saw Wall.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: HIGH-TECH BUS FARE 
COLLECTION SYSTEM BEING TESTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN HURST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fumbling for change on crowded, lurching buses could be a thing of the past 
for more than a million Southern California commuters if a high-tech fare 
collection experiment announced Thursday is successful. 
</P>
<P>
 The three-month experiment allows suburban bus riders in the Foothill Transit 
District and the Culver City and Montebello municipal bus lines to purchase 
electronic fare cards that are debited each time a passenger boards a bus. 
</P>
<P>
 "They don't have to stand there and dig through their pockets and try to come 
up with loose change," said Andrea Greene, spokeswoman for the Metropolitan 
Transportation Authority, which funded the experiment with $4.6 million in 
state money. 
</P>
<P>
 If the test is successful, MTA officials will consider instituting the debit 
card system for the more than 1.3 million daily riders of the MTA's buses and 
trains. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the wave of the future," Greene predicted. 
</P>
<P>
 The cost to expand the debit card system throughout the MTA's vast 
three-county district would be about $30 million, say transit officials, but 
millions of dollars would be saved every year that are currently lost to 
counterfeited bus passes. 
</P>
<P>
 The debit cards are extremely difficult to counterfeit because each one 
carries an identification number and the purchase cost on electronic tape, 
similar to stripes on the backs of commercial credit cards, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 If a card is lost or stolen, it can be reported to transit officials, who can 
invalidate the card from a central computer.  
</P>
<P>
 The fare cards can be purchased for any amount. Upon boarding a bus, the 
passenger inserts the card into a slot next to the old-style coin box and the 
fare is deducted from the amount coded on the magnetic tape. An electronic 
window flashes the amount of fare left on the card each time it is used. When 
that amount is as low as $10, the figure is automatically printed on the card 
to alert the commuter. 
</P>
<P>
 Such cards have been in use for years on commuter rail lines such as the Bay 
Area Rapid Transit system in San Francisco, but MTA officials say that only New 
York City has instituted an electronic debit system for buses. JOHN HURST

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES COUNTY; TAX 
RELIEF DEADLINE EXTENDED FOR FIRE VICTIMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An important tax relief deadline for victims of last fall's wildfires has been 
extended, an official with the California Society of Enrolled Agents said this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 Legislation signed March 30 by Gov. Pete Wilson gives taxpayers who suffered 
losses in the Southern California fires until Oct. 15 to decide whether to 
claim losses on their state income tax returns for 1993 -- the year of the loss 
-- or on amended 1992 state returns. 
</P>
<P>
 The deadline for that choice was April 15 until Wilson signed Senate Bill 
1234. The federal deadline remains April 15.  
</P>
<P>
 "Deciding which year to claim fire losses can make a difference of thousands 
of dollars to some taxpayers," said Cap Porterfield, who chairs CSEA's Public 
Disaster Service Committee.  
</P>
<P>
 For example, he said, those who lost their business or place of employment to 
the fires may have suffered a significant reduction of income in 1993 compared 
to 1992. In some cases it may be a major tax advantage to claim disaster losses 
in the year of higher income, Porterfield said.  
</P>
<P>
 California does not require paperwork requesting an extension unless a 
taxpayer expects to have a balance due on the return.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; CITY TO 
PAY $500,000 TO WOMAN HIT BY PARKS TRUCK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles City Council approved a $500,000 settlement Tuesday for an 
elderly woman who was hit by a parks truck while in a crosswalk.  
</P>
<P>
 Soon Bok Kim, 77, needs a walker and cannot rise or sit without help.She will 
require around-the-clock attendant care as she ages, said a gerontologist and a 
physical therapist.  
</P>
<P>
 "A jury would probably find the city of Los Angeles liable for the accident," 
according to a report written by Deputy City Atty. Theodore Heyck. "In view of 
the plaintiff's injuries, a jury could return a verdict in excess of the 
proposed settlement."  
</P>
<P>
 Kim was crossing Western Avenue at 1st Street in Koreatown on Dec. 16, 1991, 
when Elbert Johnson, a locksmith in the Recreation and Parks Department, drove 
through the intersection.  
</P>
<P>
 The driver claimed that Kim ran into the intersection against a "walk" signal, 
but a witness said Johnson was trying to beat a yellow light when the accident 
occurred.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: TORRANCE; DDT CLEANUP 
TO BEGIN IN 2 BACK YARDS NEXT WEEK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Crews will start work next Monday to remove DDT-contaminated soil from the 
yards behind two homes on West 204th Street near Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency says it will remove about 8,000 cubic 
feet of tainted soil from the two yards. At least two families will be 
relocated during the project, which is expected to take 10 days to two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Unusually high levels of the banned insecticide DDT were discovered in the 
back yards during federal testing last month. Although EPA officials say they 
do not know where the DDT came from, some residents believe it migrated from a 
nearby federal Superfund site, the former Montrose Chemical Corp. facility, 
where DDT was manufactured from 1947 to 1982.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES COUNTY; 
MALIBU STUDENTS PLANT TREES AT SOUTH-CENTRAL SCHOOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Malibu teen-agers returned a favor Thursday and revitalized a friendship 
forged in disasters that struck two diverse communities in Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 The Malibu students helped plant eight giant trees at a school in riot-scarred 
South-Central Los Angeles as a gesture of thanks for the help of Edison Middle 
School students last fall in restoring greenery in the wildfire-ravaged coastal 
community. 
</P>
<P>
 "It grew new roots in the hills and it grew new roots of friendship here," 
said Joseph Santana, the principal at Edison. 
</P>
<P>
 After disastrous fires engulfed hundreds of homes and denuded Malibu hillsides 
last fall, 70 youngsters from Edison showed up to help plant shrubs and trees. 
Twenty Malibu High School students arrived Thursday at Edison. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to making new friends, students from the two communities had an 
opportunity to share their experiences in dealing with riots, fires and 
earthquakes. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's incredible to see the kids reunite. They know they are doing something 
important here, something bigger than all of them," said Andy Lipkis, whose 
nonprofit TreePeople organization participated in the tree planting.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: SIGNAL HILL; MINISTER 
FINDS INFANT IN BAG ON CHURCH DOORSTEP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Police were searching Thursday for the parents of a baby that a minister found 
in a vinyl bag at the front door of his Signal Hill church. 
</P>
<P>
 The pastor's dog sniffed out the infant about 5:25 a.m. at Signal Hill First 
Baptist Church at 1948 E. 20th St. The baby was wrapped in a towel and tucked 
in the bag, said police Detective Mary Risinger. 
</P>
<P>
 Police took the child to Long Beach Memorial Medical Center, where he was in 
good condition. 
</P>
<P>
 The child, weighing six pounds, was less than a day old and had probably been 
on the church steps no more than two hours, authorities said. The county 
Department of Children's Services will find a home for the baby, Risinger said.

MAN FACES HATE CRIME CHARGE IN ASSAULT; COURTS: AUTHORITIES SAY DEFENDANT 
ATTACKED 70-YEAR-OLD IMMIGRANT BECAUSE OF HIS ETHNICITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ED BOND, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A homeless man pleaded not guilty Thursday in Glendale Municipal Court to 
felony assault as a hate crime in an attack on a 70-year-old Armenian 
immigrant. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said Edmond S. Antone, 45, shouted the Armenian word for stupid and 
ethnic insults Tuesday as he attacked Sarkis Shavaladian on a street in 
Glendale, and later complained that Armenians were taking jobs from native-born 
Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 Glendale police said Antone jumped from behind a bush on Glenoaks Boulevard, 
grabbed Shavaladian by the lapels of his suit, threw him onto the hood of a car 
and pummeled him. 
</P>
<P>
 Bystanders who rescued Shavaladian said Antone shouted ethnic slurs against 
Armenians as he punched and kicked the man, an arrest report stated. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of them should go back where they came from," Antone told the arresting 
officer, according to the report. "They take our homes, our jobs, they buy up 
everything, and look at me. I was born here. They don't belong here." 
</P>
<P>
 Municipal Commissioner Daniel F. Calabro set bail at $100,000. Antone is being 
held in Los Angeles County Jail, awaiting a preliminary hearing scheduled for 
April 18 in Glendale Municipal Court. 
</P>
<P>
 Bozajian said that Antone is being prosecuted for a hate crime -- handled by 
the district attorney's organized crime and anti-terrorism division -- because 
the attack appeared to be motivated only by the victim's nationality. 
</P>
<P>
 The assault charge ordinarily carries a sentence of two to four years in 
prison, but the hate crime designation can add one to three years to that. 
</P>
<P>
 Shavaladian, who does not speak much English, said he had seen Antone only 
once before, "a long time ago," and was confused about why he would be singled 
out. 
</P>
<P>
 "What are Armenians to him?" Shavaladian asked Thursday, complaining of pain 
in his wrist where Antone allegedly wrenched it. Shavaladian, who came to 
America from Iran two years ago to live with his son, also suffered face and 
chest bruises. 
</P>
<P>
 In a previous case, Antone pleaded not guilty to a misdemeanor charge of 
assaulting a city animal control worker who confiscated Antone's dog in July, 
1992, said Assistant Dist. Atty. James Bozajian. 
</P>
<P>
 Antone apparently began living on the streets in Glendale shortly after his 
girlfriend entered a convalescent hospital, a hospital spokeswoman said.

SO CLOSE AND SO FAR; AFTER 20 YEARS, AMERICAN FINDS HIS VIETNAMESE GIRLFRIEND 
AND CHILDREN JUST MILES AWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Twenty years and three freeways separated them. 
</P>
<P>
 Separated from his girlfriend and children during the fall of Saigon, Ronald 
Yohe always wondered where in the world they were. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday he discovered they were 30 miles away. 
</P>
<P>
 In the final days of 1974, Yohe, then 42, watched the Communists sweep through 
Saigon. Everyone was bailing out and Yohe was next. Ny Pham, his 23-year-old 
girlfriend and mother of his two children, had to find her own mother in the 
Mekong Delta. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities told Yohe that if he followed her, he was dead. When he said 
goodby, she wept but refused to look back at him. 
</P>
<P>
 That was 20 years ago, and Yohe, an aircraft repair contractor from 
California, continued to hopscotch the globe, landing in Iran and Thailand and 
Honolulu before moving to Westminster two years ago. He lives there in an 
efficiency apartment covered with pictures of military aircraft and pinups of 
Vietnamese models. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, the American Red Cross called to say that Pham -- who had never 
married -- and her children were living just miles away in Rosemead. Yohe, now 
62, who had made numerous inquiries through the Red Cross and the Catholic 
Church to locate them, was given a telephone number. 
</P>
<P>
 It was up to Yohe, the Red Cross said. Did he still want to see them? 
</P>
<P>
 Yohe picked up the phone and dialed. He spoke to Pham and suggested they all 
meet Saturday. No way, she said. The family would be in Westminster in a couple 
of hours. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was like it was yesterday the way we spoke," he said. "They all wanted to 
see me right away." 
</P>
<P>
 And so they did. Hugging and crying and laughing in the parking lot of a 
Westminster apartment complex. Pham, now 43, brought their two children, Bao 
Quoc Pham, 21, and Binh Pham, 19, and Pham's other daughter Candy Phan, 25, 
herself a mother of two. Yohe had a larger group of his relatives there. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been 20 years," the snow-haired Yohe whispered to Pham. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know," she said. "I remember you." 
</P>
<P>
 Pham pulled a blurry black and white photo of the young couple in Vietnam out 
of her handbag. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can only keep one picture," she said, referring to the government's 
restrictive policies. "I kept it for 20 years." 
</P>
<P>
 Binh Pham could not let go of Yohe, tugging at his cheeks and kissing him 
again and again. She practiced saying daddy as if it was a foreign word she was 
trying to memorize. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every family had a daddy and I didn't have one," she told her father. "Bao 
and I didn't have a daddy." 
</P>
<P>
 "Now you have one," he said softly. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside the tiny apartment, the women gathered around Yohe on his bed, flipping 
through faded photographs taken in Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 Yohe said he had forgotten much of his Vietnamese vocabulary over the years, 
but he and Pham nervously traded recollections of the five years they were 
together. Yohe would point at a photo and Pham would laugh at the woman who 
sold Coca-Cola or the humorous American acquaintance who sat at the dinner 
table with them one night. 
</P>
<P>
 "You get the checks and the letters I send you?" Yohe asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "I keep them all," Pham said. 
</P>
<P>
 Yohe had worked for Bell Helicopter, fixing the copters damaged during the war 
and teaching the South Vietnamese something about maintenance. He met Pham in 
Tuy Hoa, on the coast of the South China Sea, through a friend of a friend. 
Separated from his wife in the United States, Yohe began a relationship with 
Pham and she followed him as he traveled throughout the country fixing 
aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, he left her with the television, the refrigerator, the children 
and a promise that they would meet again someday in the United States. He sent 
her $100 every two weeks and she sent him letters. But within six months, the 
Communists had taken Saigon and all communication was lost. 
</P>
<P>
 Yohe later divorced, and while he was still working overseas, his siblings and 
parents did what they could to try to find his Vietnamese family, even 
contacting Camp Pendleton for help. 
</P>
<P>
 In December, Yohe contacted the Southeast Asian specialist for the Orange 
County chapter of the American Red Cross. As it happened, the Phams had placed 
a similar request earlier in the year through the Red Cross chapter in the San 
Gabriel Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were in the same area of Southern California and neither one of them 
knew it," said Kara Lakkees of the Red Cross. "Now they're together." 
</P>
<P>
 Asthmatic and living on disability, Yohe settled in Westminster two years ago. 
About the same time, the Phams relocated to Rosemead after living in the 
Philippines. Pham got a job as a seamstress. The children are in school. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday night, an hour after being reunited with his family, Yohe's head 
was still spinning, he said. Was he going to move everyone into his apartment? 
Would they all live together? He still hadn't figured it all out. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want my dad to live with me and my family," Binh Pham said without 
hesitation. "For 19 years, I never had a dad." 
</P>
<P>
 Yohe, sipping on a beer and shaking at the revelation that had occurred only 
hours ago, didn't know what to say. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who do I look like, Daddy?" Binh Pham asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "You look like your mommy and me," he said with a smile.

RIORDAN REPORTS $6 MILLION INCOME ON $70 MILLION IN INVESTMENTS; DISCLOSURE: 
THE HOLDINGS MAKE HIM THE WEALTHIEST CITY OFFICIAL BY FAR. REPORTS SHOW FERRARO 
AND BRAUDE WITH CONSIDERABLE STOCK PORTFOLIOS.

 Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan's most complete financial disclosure to date 
shows that he earned more than $6 million last year from an investment 
portfolio that exceeded $70 million. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to his investment gains, Riordan earned $440,000 for six months 
work at his law firm, Riordan & McKinzie. He took a massive pay cut in July 
when he moved to City Hall, where he draws a salary of $1 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 In statements filed with the city Ethics Commission, Riordan disclosed a net 
worth of more than $70 million from a wide range of investments and property 
holdings, easily making him the wealthiest of Los Angeles' city officials. 
Riordan's wealth is not surprising since it was reported during last year's 
mayoral campaign that he had a personal fortune of about $100 million. 
</P>
<P>
 After he took office, Riordan put his holdings in a blind trust to avoid 
conflicts of interest. The financial disclosure does not include any 
investments made after the creation of the trust last July. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan's investments include $8.2 million in Mattel stock, a $2.1-million 
interest in the historic Pantry Restaurant, a $1.75-million share in the Fine 
Arts Building and $9.75 million in Tetratech Inc. stock. 
</P>
<P>
 His income comes from a wide range of sources. He made $180,000 from the 
Pantry; $24,000 from Kaufman and Broad Inc.; $440,000 from Pacific Coast 
Packaging; $50,000 from Adohr Farms and $2.85 million from F. S. Equity. 
</P>
<P>
 The disclosure statement, which is required twice a year for hundreds of city 
officials, is designed to make officeholders aware of their potential conflicts 
of interest and provide a public record of investments. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the 15 City Council members who also filed financial reports, Council 
President John Ferraro and Councilman Marvin Braude reported the most extensive 
financial portfolios. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of Ferraro's wealth is concentrated in stock holdings in 76 different 
companies. He listed 24 companies in which his wife Margaret holds stock, but 
conceded that it was difficult for him to make a precise accounting. In a note 
to the Ethics Commission, he said, "She informed me that they were her 
investments and therefore she does not want to disclose them." 
</P>
<P>
 Braude is also immersed in stocks and bonds, with 22 separate investments. His 
wife holds an interest in a trust that has similar investments. 
</P>
<P>
 At the other end of the spectrum was Councilwoman Ruth Galanter, who reported 
no income, gifts, honorariums or investments, aside from her $90,680 salary.

RABBI IS CONVICTED OF MONEY CONSPIRACY; COURTS: JURY FAILS TO REACH VERDICTS ON 
COUNTS OF BANK FRAUD AND CHARGES THAT ABRAHAM LOW ACTUALLY ENGAGED IN THE 
LAUNDERING OF CASH, AS DISTINCT FROM CONSPIRING TO DO SO. IT WAS HIS SECOND 
TRIAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A Los Angeles federal court jury on Thursday convicted an Orthodox rabbi of 
conspiracy to launder drug money. 
</P>
<P>
 The jury deliberated more than a week before finding Abraham Low, rabbi at 
Mogen Abraham, an Orthodox Jewish synagogue on La Brea Avenue, guilty of one 
felony charge. 
</P>
<P>
 The jurors were unable to reach unanimous verdicts on two other 
money-laundering charges and six bank-fraud charges. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the second trial for Low. Last year, a different jury failed to reach a 
verdict on any of the charges against the 43-year-old rabbi after deliberating 
for 25 days. 
</P>
<P>
 Low's attorney, Thomas J. Nolan, said his client was disappointed at the 
conviction and planned to ask U.S. District Judge Robert M. Takasugi for a new 
trial. If the request is denied, Low will appeal the verdict, Nolan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Takasugi scheduled a May 9 hearing for post-trial motions and to ascertain 
whether the government will seek to retry Low on any of the charges on which 
the jury failed to reach a verdict. 
</P>
<P>
 During the latest trial, the government presented video and audio tapes of 
meetings between Low and an undercover FBI agent posing as a drug dealer who 
wanted the rabbi to launder money for him. Prosecutors said the tape showed 
Low's financial acumen and his desire to engage in profitable, illegal 
activities. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant U.S. Atty. Leslie A. Swain said Low met five times with the 
undercover agent. 
</P>
<P>
 The agent said Low told him how he could set up a long-term money-laundering 
operation and transfer the illicit drug money through diamond dealers and 
through charity-related bank accounts in Europe. The agent said Low told him he 
could launder up to $5 million a week. 
</P>
<P>
 The jury, while favoring guilt by a 10-2 vote, was unable to reach unanimous 
verdicts on two charges that Low actually engaged in money laundering, as 
distinct from conspiring to do it.  
</P>
<P>
 The jury was evenly divided on charges that Low defrauded Home Savings of 
America when he deposited a $496,000 Bank of America cashier's check that 
turned out to be stolen and forged. 
</P>
<P>
 Low, financial consultant Alan Weston, 50, of Hollywood and Sharlesseta Brown 
of Lomita were indicted in January, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Weston pleaded guilty to a conspiracy charge and testified against Low. Brown 
pleaded guilty to related charges on Wednesday, Swain said. 
</P>
<P>
 The maximum penalty under federal law for conspiracy is a five-year prison 
term and a $250,000 fine.

$13.5 MILLION ADDED TO COLISEUM REPAIR FUNDS; RECOVERY: FEMA ALLOCATION MEANS 
THAT THREE-QUARTERS OF THE MONEY NEEDED TO FINISH ON TIME HAS BEEN COMMITTED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 With earthquake repair at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum proceeding at a 
fast pace, federal disaster officials announced Thursday that they have 
allocated an additional $13.5 million to fix the facility, bringing federal 
funds committed to $24.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
 During tours of the stadium Thursday and earlier in the week, the Coliseum 
Commission's project director, Don C. Webb, said that with less than 150 days 
to go before the beginning of the Raiders and USC football seasons, he is 
optimistic that enough of the work will be done to allow the games to be played 
there, although the crowds may have to be held to 50,000 while upper-level work 
continues. 
</P>
<P>
 The authorization of the second infusion of funds was signed by Richard W. 
Krimm, associate director for response and recovery at the Federal Emergency 
Management Agency (FEMA). The Washington-based official is in California this 
week reviewing progress of quake reconstruction in general. 
</P>
<P>
 Krimm noted that the Coliseum money will be held in reserve until construction 
bills come in, and that the state of California is obligated to contribute 10% 
of the costs. 
</P>
<P>
 The director of the state Office of Emergency Services, Richard Andrews, 
confirmed that the state has already committed about $2.6 million as its share, 
and a spokesman for Gov. Pete Wilson said that money will come out of an 
earthquake reconstruction bond issue that the electorate is being asked to 
approve in the June primary election. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson's spokesman, Paul Kranhold, said that if the bonds are not approved, 
"We will have to look elsewhere for the money," but he said the governor is 
confident that the voters will say yes. 
</P>
<P>
 Coliseum officials are sticking with their earlier estimate that total repair 
costs will run about $34.7 million, although they say the cost could change. 
</P>
<P>
 With more than three-fourths of that figure now committed by federal and state 
authorities, the officials are expressing confidence the rest will be 
forthcoming when needed, and FEMA and state spokesmen indicated Thursday that 
the agencies are fully cooperating with the repair project. 
</P>
<P>
 Krimm said President Clinton has expressed interest in having the Coliseum 
repairs go forward. A White House task force chaired by John Emerson, a former 
official in the Los Angeles mayoral office of Tom Bradley, is overseeing the 
Administration's coordination of overall earthquake relief efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 Webb, meanwhile, discounted speculation that the historic peristyle at the 
east end of the stadium is so badly damaged that it will have to be torn down 
and rebuilt. 
</P>
<P>
 He said that enough of the facing of the peristyle has been removed to show 
how much damage was done in the Jan. 17 earthquake, and he is confident that 
repairs can be successful, although they will probably wait for the most part 
until after the facility is reopened. 
</P>
<P>
 "The project budget does not include major seismic upgrading of the press box 
(atop the Coliseum's south rim) and the specific means of stabilizing and 
strengthening the peristyle is still under development," Webb said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 But emergency shoring of the peristyle end can provide an evacuation route for 
spectators in case of an emergency, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Workers for the Tutor-Saliba Corp., the main Coliseum contractor for the 
repairs, are beginning this week to drill holes for the seismic reinforcing 
piles and columns that will be necessary to protect the stadium's 
superstructure in the future. Excavation of the upper concourse to facilitate 
this work is nearing completion. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, most concession booths have been moved away from the stadium's 
outer concourse to facilitate the installation of the reinforcing columns. 
Trees impeding this work have been cut down or, as in the case of palm trees, 
set in boxes for replanting. 
</P>
<P>
 State officials present Thursday said that most historic preservation issues 
regarding the repair project have been resolved, and they expressed optimism 
the remainder also will be.

DANA PARSONS: FALLEN HERO'S FIX: SORRY ADDICT OR RESPONSIBILITY DODGER? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Dana Parsons 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For those of us who study baseball and real life with equal interest, Darryl 
Strawberry is always good for a seminar topic or two. Somehow or other, the 
Straw man finds a way to suck us into a conversation. 
</P>
<P>
 Lately, of course, it's the announcement that the Los Angeles Dodger 
outfielder is heading for drug rehab -- this thrust upon us right before 
Opening Day and after a spring in which all his tulips were supposedly blooming 
and when, according to his own words, he had finally found "peace." 
</P>
<P>
 Once again, we have to decide whether we A) will never believe another word he 
says, B) feel sorry for him or C) just don't care anymore. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the equation for Strawberry and other drug dependents, I would 
suggest, is how much responsibility we feel they bear for their problems. In 
search of expert clinical guidance, I went to Alan Shein, medical director of 
the Chemical Dependency Center at Hoag Hospital in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "People who work in the field of chemical dependency typically don't view 
addiction as a matter of someone not having willpower," he said. "It's much 
more complicated than that." 
</P>
<P>
 While noting that there is a "disease model" that covers many addicts, Shein 
said he views ongoing drug users as people who "are not receiving the necessary 
support they need in order to stay away from alcohol or drugs." 
</P>
<P>
 What about their free will to do so themselves? "That has to do with 
motivation, not lack of willpower," Shein said. "Motivation is key. If someone 
is not motivated to remain abstinent, if they're not willing to put some effort 
into a recovery program . . . it's a whole slew of things that someone needs to 
do to change their lives so they remain abstinent." 
</P>
<P>
 But doesn't that take it out of a "disease" mode? "When you put it in terms of 
a disease that you can't help, I think a person chooses not to help themself," 
Shein said. "I don't believe that with many people -- once they've been exposed 
to a recovery program -- that it is an acceptable reason if they can come in to 
me and say, 'There is no way I can do anything but use drugs, this is 
inevitable.' That may be the case once they've started using the drugs, 
especially with certain drugs. Once you have started using them on a daily 
basis, your body becomes physiologically dependent on the drug and you have to 
continue to use the drug to avoid really significant withdrawal symptoms." 
</P>
<P>
 Should we feel sorry for Strawberry? "I honestly don't know how I felt when I 
heard the whole thing," Shein said. "Part of me said, give this guy a chance. 
We have people who go through a first treatment for the wrong reason and 
they're really not at that point motivated, but maybe at a later point in life, 
they have lost enough and hurt enough to where they say, 'You know what, that 
first time I went through, I really didn't feel this was what I needed to do, 
but I'm hurting so bad now, and I let all those people down, and I'm at a point 
now where I'm willing to quote unquote surrender and do whatever you tell me.' 
" 
</P>
<P>
 Shein said he hopes Strawberry is at that point. When Strawberry first went to 
rehab in 1990, Shein said, "he probably hadn't lost enough and felt enough 
consequences from his addiction. Maybe everything really did fall apart last 
Sunday when he didn't show up for that game. Maybe he did reach emotional 
bottom where he said, 'Wow, this really has taken over my life,' and there was 
finally that recognition." 
</P>
<P>
 I suggested we were getting back to personal responsibility. "It's a very 
complicated illness, is the way I look at it," Shein said. "It's not a 
straightforward thing like you suddenly find out you have cancer and there's 
nothing you can do about it. There is a personal responsibility involved. Many 
times with addictions, people are not willing to be personally responsible." 
</P>
<P>
 Lots of people have strong negative feelings toward Strawberry. "I think 
there's a lot of jealousy," Shein said. "He's famous, he's paid enormous sums 
of money, and people have disdain for baseball players in the first place, 
right now. People are struggling to even own a home or a car and these guys are 
making a fortune. I think there's a lot of anger at that and this is a great 
way to focus that anger at one player who is standing out from the rest. You 
know what, I'd feel more sorry for him if he were a guy working in a factory 
and he lost his job. Then you'd say, 'That poor guy.' It's hard to say 'that 
poor guy' to a guy who the day before hit a 500-foot home run and is getting 
paid $4 million a year." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite Strawberry's seeming indifference, Shein said it's possible he's 
genuinely tormented. "Chemically dependent people set themselves up a lot of 
times for goals where they can beat up on themselves. Maybe he set some really 
high standards for himself this spring. Maybe he genuinely wanted to do well 
and at the same time was struggling with addiction. It could have been a really 
horrible time for him." 
</P>
<P>
 Many people wish Strawberry would simply disappear from the local sports 
scene. The Dodgers still must decide whether they're dealing with a sick man or 
someone who simply makes them sick. 
</P>
<P>
 In a way, that's the dilemma Darryl Strawberry poses for all of us. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wonder what's going on inside" his head, Shein said. "I bet he's hurting 
pretty bad."

MAN JAILED IN HIJACKING OF BIG RIG TRUCK; INVESTIGATION: AUTHORITIES SAY 
SUSPECT HAD PROBLEMS DRIVING THE VEHICLE AND WAS PURSUED BY OTHER TRUCKERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A San Clemente man is in jail in lieu of $100,000 bail after discovering a big 
rig is tougher to drive than it looks, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dennis Du Bois, 25, is charged with hijacking a tractor-trailer truck 
Wednesday from the Whittaker brake-check facility on the Golden State Freeway 
north of Castaic. 
</P>
<P>
 The suspect drove to the site in a car at about 2 p.m. and became angry when 
none of the truck drivers he attempted to flag down would stop to pick him up, 
said California Highway Patrol Officer Wendy Moore of the Newhall office. The 
CHP doesn't know why Du Bois abandoned the car or wanted a ride. 
</P>
<P>
 Du Bois walked in front of a big rig driven by Domingo Palomo, 32, of Delano 
and fired one shot from a .44-magnum handgun into the pavement, Moore said. 
</P>
<P>
 CHP reports indicate Palomo was in the truck cab when the gun was fired, but a 
witness said Palomo was standing in front of the vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
 "The guy fired a round at the driver between his legs and the driver jumped 
back and let him have it (the truck)," said Richard Hyer, a driver from Akron, 
Ohio. "And I don't blame him." 
</P>
<P>
 Du Bois allegedly climbed into the big rig and drove it south on the Golden 
State Freeway, with Hyer and other truckers in pursuit. 
</P>
<P>
 But apparently Du Bois had some trouble with the truck's complicated gears and 
was oblivious to the trail of following truckers, all keeping tabs on his 
whereabouts and communicating with their CB radios, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was just trying to find the gears," said Hyer. "He was so busy trying to 
shift, he wasn't looking at anything else." 
</P>
<P>
 The truck exited on Templin Highway and proceeded west to the Old Golden State 
Highway, Moore said. Pursuing truckers spotted a California Department of 
Transportation dump truck parked nearby and radioed the California Department 
of Transportation worker to call the highway patrol. 
</P>
<P>
 Once at the intersection, Du Bois unsuccessfully tried to turn the 
tractor-trailer around. Becoming discouraged, he got out and attempted to 
disengage the trailer from the cab, Hyer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Du Bois gave up and fled the truck on foot before being apprehended by CHP 
officers. 
</P>
<P>
 Hyer said that before commandeering the truck, Du Bois slashed the tires of 
the car he drove up in and began throwing clothes from the vehicle onto the 
ground. 
</P>
<P>
 Du Bois is in custody at the Santa Clarita Valley sheriff's station.

JUDGE BALKS AT DEATH SENTENCE; COURTS: VALENCIA MAN'S CONVICTED KILLER IS 
ORDERED TO FACE A SECOND TRIAL TO DETERMINE IF HE SHOULD BE EXECUTED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Angering prosecutors, jurors and the victim's family, a judge Thursday refused 
to hand down a death sentence and ordered a second trial to determine if a 
parolee should be executed for murdering a Valencia man. 
</P>
<P>
 Further surprising everyone involved in the case, Van Nuys Superior Court 
Judge Leon Kaplan said he would not preside over the new trial "in light of the 
personal attacks" made by a prosecutor in court. 
</P>
<P>
 Kaplan's ruling does not affect Scott Forrest Collins' first-degree murder 
conviction in the Jan. 23, 1992, death of Fred D. Rose, but a new jury will 
have to be selected to determine if Collins should be executed or spend the 
rest of his life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors vowed to appeal Kaplan's decision, which voided a Nov. 2 jury 
verdict that recommended the death penalty for the killer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am absolutely furious," said Sharon Rose, wife of the slain construction 
worker. "I think he (Kaplan) is the most horrible person I know of." 
</P>
<P>
 In capital cases such as Collins' trial, a jury first determines if the 
defendant is guilty. Then the panel reassembles for a "penalty phase" and makes 
a formal sentencing recommendation to a judge. 
</P>
<P>
 Kaplan, who was handling his first death penalty case, granted a defense 
motion for a new penalty phase trial, ruling that the jury improperly conducted 
an experiment during deliberations. Using a protractor and string, one juror 
argued that Rose must have been on his knees when Collins pumped a bullet into 
the back of his head. 
</P>
<P>
 "The improper consideration of evidence did affect the jury's decision," 
Kaplan said. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge also said the prosecution stepped out of bounds during a closing 
argument that asked for vengeance and indicated that the Rose family wanted 
Collins to be executed. Appeals court rulings prohibit prosecutors from telling 
a jury that a victim's family wants a convicted killer to be put to death. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorney Bruce Hill said he supported the decision. "I had argued that 
the prosecution presentation was an appeal to certain basic emotional values, 
which makes an objective determination very difficult," Hill said. 
</P>
<P>
 Juror Betty Cole, a Sunland resident who attended what she thought would be a 
sentencing hearing, said the experiment only substantiated a coroner's report 
detailing Rose's injuries, and "it didn't matter" that Rose may have been on 
his knees when he was shot. 
</P>
<P>
 "We only wanted to bring justice," Cole said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is, in my opinion, an outrage," Deputy Dist. Atty. Lea Purwin D'Agostino 
said. "Do you know how difficult it is for people to reach a verdict of death? 
You had 12 fair, impartial jurors who came to an unbelievably difficult 
decision, and they came to that unanimously, and we are now throwing their 
decision out the window." 
</P>
<P>
 D'Agostino said in court that Kaplan was twisting and torturing facts to 
justify a decision that was actually based "on this court's personal beliefs." 
</P>
<P>
 Explaining her comments outside court, D'Agostino charged that Kaplan could 
not hand down a death sentence because he is philosophically opposed to capital 
punishment. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have received information from various sources that, when he was first 
assigned this trial, that he did express reservations about sitting on a death 
penalty case," D'Agostino said outside court. If this was known, the prosecutor 
said, she would have had the trial moved to another court. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside his courtroom, Kaplan declined to comment on the case, and he refused 
to outline his position on capital punishment. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorney Bruce Hill said he was not aware of Kaplan's position on the 
death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 While he has never seen a judge recuse himself for being attacked by an 
attorney, Hill said it appears to be an appropriate decision in this case 
because "the criticism that was leveled at (Kaplan) was certainly not something 
that was quiet or hidden in any way." The defense attorney theorized Kaplan 
removed himself to ensure fairness to the prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
 Sharon Rose hopes to see another jury sometime soon return a verdict in favor 
of the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to be sitting in the front row when it happens," she said. "I'll see 
if they will let me put my finger on the button." 
</P>
<P>
 Collins is due to appear in court April 21 for scheduling a date for his new 
trial.

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: VAN NUYS; MOTEL OWNERS URGED TO HIRE SECURITY PATROL 
</P>

<P>
 After months of appearing on opposite sides in the battle over prostitution in 
Van Nuys, motel owners along Sepulveda Boulevard have met with police and City 
Council representatives to bridge their differences. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't like prostitutes sitting on the corner in front of my motel," Bhavana 
Bhakta, on-site manager of the Cabana Motel, said Wednesday night at the 
meeting of the Sepulveda Boulevard Business Watch. "This is my home, too." 
</P>
<P>
 The dozen motel managers and owners who attended the meeting were concerned 
about recent city efforts to crack down on prostitution, which police say 
occurs in and around several motels. Within the past six months, the Los 
Angeles zoning department has ordered six motels to hire security guards or 
risk losing their business licenses. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is your chance to turn things around," said Rosalind Wayman, field 
deputy for Councilman Marvin Braude, who initiated the zoning department's 
efforts. "It's the work you do now that will show that we don't need to go any 
further." 
</P>
<P>
 Gene Ho, manager of El Cortez motel, said he often tries to chase prostitutes 
away. El Cortez is one of the motels ordered to hire security, but like many 
owners and managers, Ho said he does not have the money to pay for a guard. 
</P>
<P>
 Police warned motel managers not to try dealing with the prostitutes directly. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not asking anyone to be a policeman," said Los Angeles Police Officer 
Joe Losorelli, who patrols many of the motels on Sepulveda. "Maybe some of you 
could get together as a group and hire one car with one security officer, then 
you could see how little it would cost you." 
</P>
<P>
 Managers and owners said they would meet later this month to discuss forming a 
motel watch. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, some managers expressed optimism that police, the city and motel 
owners can work together, including Mike Kim, co-owner of the Town House Motel, 
another motel ordered to hire security. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one wants the motels closed down," Kim said.JEFF SCHNAUFER

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE; CUTS IN BOOK BUDGET TAKE TOLL AT LIBRARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 If you want to borrow Danielle Steele's latest romance from the Glendale 
Public Library, get in line. 
</P>
<P>
 There's a waiting list for Steele's work and other popular novels because of 
recessionary cutbacks that have slashed the 87-year-old facility's book budget 
in half. 
</P>
<P>
 Library fund-raisers appealed to Glendale residents and Southland businesses 
this week for donations to shore up the ailing book budget -- cut from $400,000 
to $200,000 two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The Friends of the Glendale Public Library, a 2-year-old library support 
group, used Glendale city letterhead to ask businesses that contract with the 
city to make donations to the facility, said Chuck Wike, library community 
relations manager. 
</P>
<P>
 The group wants to raise $200,000 through a fund-raising campaign that 
includes a $75-a-plate dinner with science fiction writer Ray Bradbury. 
</P>
<P>
 Fund-raisers have also sent 1,000 letters asking for residents to sponsor the 
dinner. 
</P>
<P>
 A letter from the Friends of the Glendale Library to potential donors said a 
$1,000 contribution could buy 60 children's picture books, 10 business resource 
reference books or 50 novels. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the budget was cut, waiting lists at the library have climbed to 50 
people for some books, Wike said. 
</P>
<P>
 To deal with demand for popular fiction and nonfiction, the library sometimes 
rents books from McNaughton Book Service for a fee and returns them when 
requests for a book no longer require a waiting list. 
</P>
<P>
 Cutbacks have also forced administrators to cancel 50 magazine subscriptions 
and change many newspaper deliveries to Sunday only. JENNIFER OLDHAM

ON THE ISSUE: INFORMED OPINIONS ON TODAY'S TOPICS; IF YOU PATROL HERE, SHOULD

 According to a report issued last month, the American Civil Liberties Union 
concluded that 83.1% of Los Angeles Police Department officers live outside the 
city and are thus isolated from the communities the department patrols. The 
findings were swiftly denounced by LAPD supporters, who argued that like most 
suburbanites, police officers are driven out of the city in search of better 
property values and safer neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 Although a 1974 amendment to the state Constitution bars residency 
requirements, a City Council panel Monday called for a study to determine what 
financial incentives can be offered to encourage police and other public-safety 
employees to live in L.A. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Should public-safety employees be encouraged to live in the communities they 
serve? 
</P>
<P>
 Roger Gillis, battalion chief for the Los Angeles City Fire Department: 
</P>
<P>
 "All you have to do is ask for the number of firefighters on Jan. 17 that 
stayed at work and didn't leave to go home to their houses. Our employees have 
been incredibly loyal, and even more so than was anticipated by the department. 
There was a concern that in a situation like that, would there be guys who 
said, 'I'm outta here. I'm going to find out what's happening with my family.' 
. . . In the last two years, there's been a tremendous impact this city has had 
in the way of disasters and there's been tremendous loyalty. It's been shown 
again and again." 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Zinzun, chairman and co-founder of the Coalition Against Police Abuse: 
</P>
<P>
 "No. When (former Chief Daryl) Gates left, it was already clear that (the 
problem) wasn't just Gates. . . . I think it's an old demand that's proven not 
to be effective in cities like L.A. with a large demographic. . . . It's a slap 
in the face when you're trying to address the issue of sensitivity, racism and 
brutality (in the Police Department). I'm saying that we need police 
accountability, whether they live in the city or not. I think it's a plan that 
has not been thoroughly thought out. They are diverting attention away from the 
real issues by bringing this up." 
</P>
<P>
 Allan Parachini, author of the ACLU report: 
</P>
<P>
 "We think they should. One of the things that has occurred, and this has been 
documented by the Christopher Commission and the Webster Commission, is that 
there is a sense of isolation and disconnection, that the communities of Los 
Angeles feel isolated from the police. We don't mean to imply that where police 
live is the most important of these factors (but) it plays a role in the 
perception of this disconnection between police and the residents of Los 
Angeles. . . . We are encouraged by what the (City Council) committee did this 
week. They responded appropriately to our report, which was meant to be 
constructive, positive and specific." 
</P>
<P>
 Stephen Yagman, Venice attorney and longtime LAPD critic: 
</P>
<P>
 "Folks who have a stake in a particular place are more likely to care about 
that place and try to make it a better place. It's a very good idea for the 
city to offer appropriate financial incentives to all of its employees to 
encourage them to live within the city. . . . There will be those who will be 
enticed to come back. There are others who won't come back because they don't 
wish to live in the city. A much more effective method would be to require that 
new applicants maintain a residence in the city. It can be done as a matter of 
contract without violating the Constitution. New applicants have the legal 
ability to agree to it freely. . . . I'm in favor of positive inducement rather 
than negative stimuli. I don't think people should be forced to live where they 
don't want to live."

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SUN VALLEY; GROUNDBREAKING FOR PROJECT PREMATURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF SCHNAUFER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A fanfare-laden groundbreaking ceremony for a low-income housing project 
attracted a lot of attention in Sun Valley on Thursday, drawing politicians and 
other notables to the Vineland Avenue site and providing plenty of 
opportunities for picture-taking. 
</P>
<P>
 But it turns out that the ceremonies were premature.The project, envisioned as 
an 18-unit complex with laundry facilities and a recreation room, has not yet 
been approved by the city of Los Angeles. The city has approved a 14-unit 
complex for the site, but the project as described Thursday was much larger. 
</P>
<P>
 A public hearing on the expanded project is scheduled for April 18 before a 
city hearing examiner, whose recommendations must then be approved by the 
Planning Commission. If the commission's decision is appealed, then the 
proposal still must go before the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 "We should have held off until we had the hearing," conceded Nat Hutton, 
executive director of the L. A. Family Housing Corp., the nonprofit 
organization behind the project. 
</P>
<P>
 The project has the support of the Los Angeles Housing Department, which is 
providing low-income loans to help fund it. 
</P>
<P>
 The plans call for the complex to contain laundry facilities, a play area, a 
community room and a security fence. It is expected to take a year to complete 
and cost $2.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
 L. A. Family Housing Corp. operates seven other permanent affordable housing 
complexes, two emergency housing shelters and three transitional housing 
facilities. JEFF SCHNAUFER

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SAN FERNANDO; COUNCIL CANDIDATES DISCUSS REBUILDING

<P>
 San Fernando City Council candidates discussed rebuilding after the Northridge 
earthquake and rerouting the ruptured Four Corners oil pipeline during the 
final candidates forum before Tuesday's election. 
</P>
<P>
 All eight candidates were present at the Wednesday night event, sponsored by 
Valley Organized in Community Efforts (VOICE) at San Fernando's Santa Rosa 
Catholic Church.About 100 people attended. 
</P>
<P>
 Incumbents Dan Acuna, Jose Hernandez and Doude Wysbeek, and challengers Joanne 
Baltierrez, John Becker, Raul Godinez, Edward Guzman and Arthur Kay were 
questioned by a four-member panel and the public on a variety of issues, mostly 
related to rebuilding the city and the pipeline. The line ruptured near San 
Fernando's O'Melveny School as a result of the Jan. 17 earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Hernandez, 63, said the city should consider purchasing land from people who 
decide not to rebuild. 
</P>
<P>
 Guzman, 38, was critical of the current council's response to the quake, 
proposing an earthquake-preparedness plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Godinez, 32, said he would strive to better the city's image and proposed 
building "quality" affordable housing similar to the Casa Loma project in 
downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Acuna, 53, said he sees the quake as an opportunity to re-evaluate the 
council's aims and attract new business to the area. 
</P>
<P>
 Becker, 42, repeated his central campaign pledge: to keep people informed of 
the issues facing the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Wysbeek, 55, said his voting record shows that he is business-oriented, 
concerned with "the most government for the least dollars." 
</P>
<P>
 Kay said San Fernando needs to find more help from outside agencies to 
rebuild. He offered his home telephone number to the audience to show that he 
is approachable. 
</P>
<P>
 Baltierrez, 36, said the council should create a plan to attract new 
businesses to the city. MIGUEL BUSTILLO

<P>
 The Planning Commission has voted 5 to 0 to recommend to the City Council a 
revised plan for a controversial hillside development in Sleepy Hollow Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 The council will review the proposed subdivision for the third time at 6:30 
p.m. April 26.The commission vote on the 18-home project was this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Plans for the project have been revised several times since council members 
first rejected a proposal by Doty Development Co. of Glendale to build on the 
steep hillsides of Sleepy Hollow Canyon in December, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 The council voted down a second plan in February, 1992, saying it would do 
permanent destruction to the canyon's ridgeline, endanger a wooded habitat and 
occupy rare open space. 
</P>
<P>
 Doty sued the city in early 1993, alleging the council's original decision to 
deny the development did not allow Doty "economically viable use of the 
property," said Scott Howard, city attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 Resolution of the suit is pending the council's decision on the third 
proposal. JENNIFER OLDHAM

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: ENGLISH INSTRUCTION ON TV AND VIDEO

<P>
 The face of adult education is changing -- to a screen. 
</P>
<P>
 In an effort to meet the needs of current students and attract new ones, adult 
schools throughout the San Fernando Valley and Los Angeles Unified School 
District are launching a learning program designed to make learning English 
almost as easy as turning on the TV or popping a videotape into the VCR. 
</P>
<P>
 Thanks to $5 million in state adult education funds allocated to the district 
to encourage more effective use of technology, students can follow scheduled 
programming on Channel 58 on television and use textbooks and videotapes 
distributed through the adult schools to learn English without leaving home. 
</P>
<P>
 "My problem is I don't have very much time," said Elena Ibarra, 37, who works 
six days a week packing cosmetics in a Chatsworth factory. "I hope someday I 
could stay in school everyday. But now I don't have the time." 
</P>
<P>
 Like many of the students who enroll in adult education, Ibarra quit her 
English classes at Reseda Community Adult School after only a year because she 
found it impossible to juggle the demands of school with work and raising four 
children. Now she watches a videotape whenever she has a spare moment. She 
admits it is not an ideal way to learn. But, she said, it is her only option. 
</P>
<P>
 While videotapes have been available for several years at selected schools, 
the distance learning program has never been organized on a districtwide basis. 
Coordinators of the program hope to reach 5,000 new students by the summer. In 
the San Fernando Valley, administrators and teachers are advertising at 
elementary schools and churches to attract new students. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of students attend school only 50% of the time and a lot drop out after 
the first week of instruction," said Hugo Pedroza, who coordinates the distance 
learning program for the district. "They want the opportunity to learn English. 
This program accommodates their schedules rather than the other way around."

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: RESEDA; HIGH SCHOOL'S ANTI-VIOLENCE EFFORTS PRAISED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The national spotlight is again focused on the hallways and classrooms of 
Reseda High School, but this time for a good reason. 
</P>
<P>
 From the "Donahue" show to the "NBC Nightly News," the school is gaining fame 
for its unique anti-crime program launched last year in the wake of the 
shooting death of a 17-year-old student. 
</P>
<P>
 "We turned a bad thing into a positive thing," said Koroush Mohajeri, member 
of Weapons Are Removed Now or WARN, a school group that aims to persuade peers 
and younger students to break the code of silence if someone they know has a 
gun. 
</P>
<P>
 WARN members say the death of Michael Ensley at the school in February, 1993, 
was a wake-up call -- some students knew that his killer had a gun before the 
shooting and said nothing. Since the group's inception, it has performed 
anti-violence skits for politicians, appeared on local news and national shows, 
and prompted calls from schools across the country interested in starting 
similar programs. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, teacher Jay Shaffer, who started WARN; the school's principal, 
Robert Kladifko, and two members of the group were in New York City for the 
taping of Donahue's show. Linked by satellite to New York, four WARN members in 
a Reseda classroom performed one of the skits they use to show younger children 
the dangers of weapons on campus. 
</P>
<P>
 The New York audience, filled mostly with students from local schools, asked 
the in-studio Reseda guests questions on topics ranging from dress codes to the 
random use of a metal detector on campus. Also mentioned was the fact that the 
school was one of the first in the Los Angeles Unified School District to ban 
baggy pants and institute an anti-graffiti program that paid students to inform 
administrators of tagging on campus. 
</P>
<P>
 A few students in the audience said WARN would not end violence on their 
campuses in New York because students there wouldn't tell on their peers, out 
of loyalty to them or fear of retaliation. 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, students at Reseda High who watched the taping via the satellite 
link strongly defended WARN. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to help," senior Farhad Yazdani said. "WARN is the first step; 
nobody said it's going to solve the problem." 
</P>
<P>
 The taped program will air in May. SUSAN BYRNES

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: RESIDENTS WARNED ABOUT CON ARTIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Police are warning Van Nuys residents about a man who is defrauding people by 
posing as a neighbor in need of help. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are giving him money left and right," said Los Angeles Police Officer 
Chuck Leber, who was alerted to the problem by neighbors on his beat."He's 
knocking on doors until 1 o'clock in the morning and as early as 5:30 a.m." 
</P>
<P>
 According to Leber, the con artist is posing as an out-of-work neighbor with 
two children. He approaches residents in their homes and asks to borrow money 
to get his car towed or repaired. 
</P>
<P>
 Police say the scam, which began between four and six months ago, has netted 
the man hundreds of dollars from between 20 and 30 residents. Leber said the 
man is suspected of using the funds to support a "severe narcotic problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, the scams have been centered in the area bordered by Van Nuys 
Boulevard, Woodman Avenue, Victory Boulevard and Sherman Way. Police also 
suspect that the man may have been working the same scam in parts of Sherman 
Oaks and southern Van Nuys a few months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Leber said a man was questioned in February about the scams, but was released 
for lack of evidence. Recent complaints from other residents has prompted 
police to believe that the same man is involved. JEFF SCHNAUFER

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: RESEDA; NEW COMPLAINTS SPUR RAID ON PETTING ZOO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TERESA ANN WILLIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Animal regulation officials Thursday raided a Reseda petting zoo, acting on 
complaints that some animals were ill or injured and that others received 
inadequate care. 
</P>
<P>
 After an hourlong inspection, Linda Menary, owner of The Farm, was ordered to 
provide twice as much shelter for 37 ponies, horses and oxen, and cleaner water 
for her fowl and goats. 
</P>
<P>
 Inspectors found an ox with deformed feet and ordered Menary to provide its 
medical history. They also ordered her to provide medical records for a goat 
with a broken leg that Menary said she gave away last week. 
</P>
<P>
 The raid was the latest in a long history of confrontations between Menary and 
the city of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 In December, the city denied Menary a permit to operate her petting zoo, 
located in a residential area, after receiving numerous complaints from 
neighbors who claim that it is a nuisance. 
</P>
<P>
 Menary ignored the ruling. 
</P>
<P>
 In March, animal regulation officials seized nine ponies and horses from 
another of Menary's properties and arrested her on suspicion of cruelty to 
animals. Some of the animals had hoofs that had grown five to six inches too 
long. 
</P>
<P>
 Menary will go before a Los Angeles Superior Court judge Tuesday to try to get 
the horses back. 
</P>
<P>
 Two weeks after her arrest, Menary filed a $750,000 lawsuit against the city 
alleging that she was arrested without probable cause and that her ponies 
seized illegally. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Menary and her attorney, Hal Kippen, characterized Thursday's surprise 
inspection as harassment. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, there were no serious violations or else they would've seized 
something," Kippen said. "It's strictly harassment." 
</P>
<P>
 Menary said that she changes the animals' water every morning and that she 
would have a veterinarian examine the ox. 
</P>
<P>
 But she said she disagrees with the order to provide more shelter. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel I have adequate shelter," she said. "I may challenge the order 
depending upon what my veterinarian says." TERESA ANN WILLIS

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FULLERTON; SEA LION RESEARCHERS TO RELATE EXPERIENCES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLSON CUMMER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Students and professors who study sea lions on an uninhabited Mexican island 
will talk today at Fullerton College about their work, which requires them to 
camp for up to eight weeks near the mammals. 
</P>
<P>
 The researchers, who number up to 28, take food with them and are resupplied 
with water every two weeks by the Mexican Navy, said Prof. Carolyn Heath, an 
organizer of the program. 
</P>
<P>
 Heath and others will build their campsite on the Fullerton College quadrangle 
today, putting up a tent and solar panels that generate electricity. A 
professor and student from Mexico City College also will speak. The project is 
staffed by sea lion researchers from both colleges. 
</P>
<P>
 Up to 10 Fullerton College students are involved each summer.  
</P>
<P>
 The speakers will talk about the history of sea lions, their behavior, and 
what it's like to camp out and study them, Heath said. The four-hour symposium 
seeks to attract undergraduates to careers in science, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The symposium will be from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. in Room 415 of the South Science 
Building at the campus. WILLSON CUMMER

RISK OF NEURAL BIRTH DEFECTS HIGHER FOR LATINOS, STUDY FINDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Latino babies face a significantly higher risk of being born with brain and 
spinal defects than do babies in other ethnic groups, a study from the 
California Birth Defects Monitoring Program reported Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The study, which examined 700,000 live births and fetal deaths in California 
from 1983 to 1987, found that about nine of every 10,000 Latino babies were 
born with neural tube defects. 
</P>
<P>
 The two most common types of neural tube defects are spina bifida, an opening 
in the spinal cord that can cause permanent disabilities, and anencephaly, in 
which a large mass of the brain is missing at birth and which always leads to 
death. 
</P>
<P>
 Liz Stierman, a Los Angeles-based researcher for the state agency who helped 
coordinate the study, said health workers had no explanation for the high rate 
of brain and spinal problems among Latino babies. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't know whether the birth defects stem from genetic differences, 
cultural differences, environmental exposures or a combination of factors," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The study found that the statewide rate of neural tube defects was six in 
10,000 births among whites, four in 10,000 for Asians and four in 10,000 for 
African Americans.

COURT OKS USE OF MINORS IN POLICE LIQUOR SALES STINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAURA DOLAN, TIMES LEGAL AFFAIRS WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Reviving an important statewide law enforcement program, the California 
Supreme Court held Thursday that police may use teen-age decoys to determine 
whether stores, restaurants and bars illegally sell alcohol to minors. 
</P>
<P>
 In a unanimous decision, the state's high court overturned a 1993 Court of 
Appeal ruling that halted the teen-age decoy program, which state officials say 
had snagged as many as 2,000 proprietors a year for selling alcohol to minors. 
</P>
<P>
 Grocers and others have strongly objected to the 8-year-old effort, 
complaining that it targets proprietors with no record of selling to minors and 
deploys decoys who appear far older than their years. 
</P>
<P>
 But Jay Stroh, director of the California Department of Alcoholic Beverage 
Control, called the decoy program "an extremely important tool" in enforcing 
the state law. 
</P>
<P>
 A Court of Appeal in San Francisco ruled that the program was 
unconstitutional. Although the state's Constitution prohibits the sale of 
alcohol to minors, the court ruled, it does not contain an exception for minors 
working for law enforcement agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 But Chief Justice Malcolm Lucas, writing for the Supreme Court, said stores 
and other establishments can be fined or lose their licenses for selling to 
these youthful undercover police recruits. 
</P>
<P>
 "Police involvement in criminal activity for the purpose of investigating 
possible violations is permissible even if technical violations of the law 
occur," Lucas wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the Court of Appeal ruling, a majority of local law enforcement 
agencies in the state were using teen-age decoys, Stroh said. His department 
will now notify them to resume the practice. 
</P>
<P>
 Police and the decoys, often police cadets or Explorers, usually visit 15 to 
20 stores or bars a night, Stroh said. In the 1991-92 fiscal year, 1,500 
merchants were charged with selling alcohol to minors. Of those, 1,000 were 
charged because of sales to decoys. The penalty for a first offense can be a 
license suspension of several days or fines of as much as $1,500. 
</P>
<P>
 If the court had ruled the program unconstitutional, "it would have called 
into question every sting program you can think of," said Deputy Atty. Gen. 
Thomas Scheerer. 
</P>
<P>
 The case was brought by Lucky Stores and Provigo Corp., owner of Petrini 
stores in the Bay Area, which faced suspension of their licenses for selling to 
teen-age police decoys in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the decoys was a 5-foot, 7-inch, 170-pound, 19-year-old boy who bought 
liquor from a Lucky store in the East Bay city of Concord. The other was a 
200-pound, 6-foot, 1-inch, 17-year-old boy who purchased liquor from Petrini's 
in San Leandro, also in the East Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 In protesting the suspension of their licenses, the stores argued that the use 
of underage decoys was unconstitutional. They also complained they had been 
entrapped and that their rights had been violated because the police deployed 
mature-looking decoys in violation of state guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
 Alcoholic Beverage and Control guidelines advise police to use decoys who look 
well under 21, the legal drinking age. 
</P>
<P>
 "As a general rule," the high court said, "the use of decoys to expose illicit 
activity does not constitute entrapment, so long as no pressure or overbearing 
conduct is employed by the decoy." 
</P>
<P>
 In overturning the appellate court's decision, the Supreme Court said it was 
not limited by the words of the Constitution, but could seek a "practical, 
common-sense" interpretation consistent with the law's intent. 
</P>
<P>
 Renee D. Wasserman, an attorney for the stores, called the ruling an "activist 
decision" and a break from the California Supreme Court's generally strict 
reliance on the wording of the Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
 She said grocers are now working in the Legislature to develop a bill that 
would require police departments to meet standard guidelines in the use of 
their decoys and to prevent them from targeting stores randomly. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a multiracial society and a society where people expect quick 
service," Wasserman said. "The retailer has to make a quick decision as to 
whether they think somebody is over the age of 21 or not."

HOMELESS MAN HELD IN HATE CRIME; COURTS: EDMOND S. ANTONE, 45, PLEADS INNOCENT 
TO FELONY ASSAULT IN ATTACK ON ARMENIAN IMMIGRANT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Shouting the Armenian word for "stupid" and other ethnic insults, a homeless 
man attacked a 70-year-old Armenian immigrant on the street, and later 
complained that Armenians were taking jobs from native-born Americans, police 
said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Edmond S. Antone, 45, pleaded innocent in Glendale Municipal Court on Thursday 
to felony assault as a hate crime in the attack Tuesday on Sarkis Shavaladian, 
who emigrated to America from Iran two years ago to live with his son. 
</P>
<P>
 Antone jumped from behind a bush on Glenoaks Boulevard, grabbing Shavaladian 
by the lapels of his suit, throwing him onto the hood of a car, and pummeling 
him, Glendale police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bystanders who rescued Shavaladian said Antone continued to shout ethnic slurs 
against Armenians as he punched and kicked the man, an arrest report stated. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of them should go back where they came from," Antone told the arresting 
police officer, according to the report. "They take our homes, our jobs, they 
buy up everything, and look at me. I was born here. They don't belong here." 
</P>
<P>
 Glendale Municipal Court Commissioner Daniel F. Calabro set bail at $100,000. 
Antone was being held in the Los Angeles County Jail for a preliminary hearing 
scheduled April 18 in Glendale Municipal Court. Antone also pleaded innocent to 
a misdemeanor charge of assaulting a city animal control worker who confiscated 
Antone's dog in July 1992, said Assistant Dist. Atty. James Bozajian. 
</P>
<P>
 Bozajian said that Antone was being prosecuted for a hate crime -- handled by 
the district attorney's organized crime and anti-terrorism division -- because 
the attack appeared to be motivated only by the victim's nationality. 
</P>
<P>
 The assault charge carries a sentence of two to four years in prison, but the 
hate crime designation can add one to three years to that. 
</P>
<P>
 Shavaladian, who does not speak much English, said he had seen Antone only 
once before "a long time ago," and was confused about why he would be singled 
out. 
</P>
<P>
 "What are Armenians to him?" Shavaladian asked Thursday, complaining of pain 
in his wrist where Antone allegedly wrenched it. Shavaladian also suffered face 
and chest bruises. 
</P>
<P>
 Antone apparently began living on the streets in that neighborhood of Glendale 
shortly after his girlfriend, Constance Devaney, became a patient at the 
Glenoaks Convalescent Hospital on Glenoaks Boulevard, said Ann Fenton, director 
of social services for the Glenoaks hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Devaney, who had lived on the streets with Antone, had been transferred there 
from Olive View Memorial Hospital in Sylmar, Fenton said. 
</P>
<P>
 Known sometimes by his street nickname, "Pick-up Eddie," Antone frequently 
showed up at the hospital drunk and dirty, she said. She described him as "very 
vocal and loud," saying she feared Antone would attack her or a nursing 
supervisor, and that hospital employees were considering seeking a restraining 
order against him. 
</P>
<P>
 She added that she had heard him yelling at Armenians in the neighborhood 
before, but did not know why. 
</P>
<P>
 Chahe Keuroghelian, intercultural relations coordinator for the Glendale 
Police Department, said the last hate crime in Glendale was about a year ago 
when an Armenian's car was vandalized. 
</P>
<P>
 Just under 20% of Glendale's 195,000 residents are of Armenian descent.

JURY REJECTS DEATH FOR KILLER OF ARMORED CAR GUARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOM MROZEK, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Disregarding a prosecutor's plea for the death penalty, a jury Thursday 
decided that a parolee who murdered an armored car guard during a hardware 
store robbery should spend the rest of his life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 After three days of deliberations, a Superior Court jury ruled that Sean 
Darnell Slade does not deserve to die for the fatal shooting of guard Edwin 
(Eddie) Maldonado during a July 29, 1992, robbery at a Home Depot store in San 
Fernando. 
</P>
<P>
 Slade, 27, showed no emotion as the jury's decision was announced. 
</P>
<P>
 The victim's mother, Camelina Rodriguez of Pasadena, said through a spokesman 
that she was disappointed by the verdict, "but at least it's over." 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Jeff Jonas said he was "very satisfied that in the year 
2054 . . . Mr. Slade will still be in custody, cooling his heels, eating state 
prison food." 
</P>
<P>
 Most jurors declined to comment. "It's been too emotional," one said as she 
hurried to an elevator in the Van Nuys Courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
 Another juror said deliberations focused on "lingering doubts" about Slade's 
role in the crime. Other than an eyewitness identification, there was no hard 
evidence in the case, the juror said, and this "didn't lead to the certainty 
needed to put him death." 
</P>
<P>
 "Life without parole is a fairly appropriate sentence," the juror said. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorney Bruce Hill suggested during closing arguments that evidence 
was insufficient to warrant the death penalty, asking the question, "Are you 
that sure?" 
</P>
<P>
 Two jurors initially favored the death penalty, according to the juror who 
discussed the deliberations. They were swayed by other jurors who argued that 
Slade, even if sentenced to death, would probably never be executed because of 
delays caused by appeals. 
</P>
<P>
 During the trial, Slade testified that he had nothing to do with Maldonado's 
death. He did admit killing another man in 1987, which led to a manslaughter 
conviction. 
</P>
<P>
 Slade was paroled only 25 days before Maldonado was shot without warning. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Ronald S. Coen will formally sentence Slade to life in prison without 
the possibility of parole during a hearing April 29.

PLAN FOR SPORTS FIELDS IN BASIN DUE STUDY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Over the objections of bird-watchers and other environmentalists, a city panel 
has agreed to consider replacing a sod farm in Sepulveda Basin with lighted 
softball and soccer fields. 
</P>
<P>
 Movie producer Les Greif and the Showbiz Softball League have proposed 
building five softball fields, four basketball courts, a snack stand and other 
facilities on a 56.5-acre site on the west side of Balboa Boulevard, just north 
of the Los Angeles River. Proponents said the city would get about 15% of the 
profits, or about $288,000 annually, primarily in user fees. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, the city does not earn any revenue from the property, which is 
owned by the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers. Valley Sod pays the Corps $91,800 
annually to rent 36 acres of the land. If the project were developed, the city 
would lease the land from the Corps for a nominal fee and sublease it to 
Showbiz Softball League. 
</P>
<P>
 Citing the dearth of sports facilities in San Fernando Valley, the Recreation 
and Parks Commission agreed Wednesday to hire a consultant to study the 
proposal. Councilwoman Laura Chick, who represents the area, supported the 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's worth at least looking at -- we're not saying (Chick) is going to 
support it," said Diana Brueggemann, Chick's senior legislative deputy. 
</P>
<P>
 Brueggemann said the councilwoman is also sympathetic to the concerns of 
wildlife enthusiasts, who argue that migratory waterfowl such as Canada geese 
rely on the site to forage during the winter months. 
</P>
<P>
 "Piecemeal development has ruined the basin's ability to sustain wildlife," 
said Peter Ireland, president of the Coalition to Save Sepulveda Basin. 
"There's no way that that section of the basin near the Los Angeles River could 
continue to function as a wildlife corridor if they start blasting stadium 
lights."

JUDGE VOIDS PLANS FOR CANYON DEVELOPMENT; COURTS: ORDINANCE GIVING CITY 
AUTHORITY TO APPROVE MORE HOMES THAN ANTICIPATED BY L.A. COUNTY IS OVERTURNED. 
</P>

 A judge has voided plans for a 250-home development in a secluded canyon in 
Calabasas and overturned an ordinance critics said was an end run around an 
earlier court decision against the project. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Diane Wayne on Wednesday overturned an 
ordinance giving Calabasas authority to approve the construction of more homes 
in the Las Virgenes Valley of the Santa Monica Mountains than were originally 
anticipated by Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're delighted by the judge's decision," said Frank Angel, attorney for Save 
Open Space, an environmental group that challenged the project. "It has removed 
a potential 300-acre stain in the heart of a riparian area." 
</P>
<P>
 Calabasas originally approved the 250-home Micor Ventures project in 1992 with 
the belief that the city could stray from guidelines for the area set by Los 
Angeles County, which would have permitted only 81 homes there. It was, 
ironically, the year after Calabasas incorporated in the wake of complaints by 
residents that too many large developments had been approved by Los Angeles 
County. 
</P>
<P>
 Save Open Space had argued that the county's guidelines prevailed because the 
city had not rejected them before approving the Micor development. 
</P>
<P>
 The city of Calabasas, however, is working on its own General Plan which, once 
approved, will supersede the old county guidelines for the 900-acre site and 
the rest of the city. As drafted, the General Plan would allow 250 homes in Las 
Virgenes Valley, but Angel said his clients hope to convince the city 
otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Marvin Lopata on Thursday defended the council's approval of the 
project, saying that, under an agreement with the developer, 600 acres would be 
set aside as open area. And he said this week's ruling puts new cities in a 
bind. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole reason for the incorporation of a city is to take control of land 
issues that affect the citizens," Lopata said. "What this case says it that we 
don't have that right." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Micor Ventures has lost control of the property to its investors, 
further clouding the future of the property. 
</P>
<P>
 "It could be for sale or (the investors) could be looking for a joint 
venture," said Charles Cohen, counsel to the property owners. "The principal 
approach is to hope that (Micor) can come back in and complete the project." 
</P>
<P>
 Before the project could be revived, though, it would have to be re-approved 
under the new General Plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday's ruling comes out of the second of two lawsuits filed by Save Open 
Space regarding the project. In the first, a Los Angeles Superior Court judge 
ruled in 1993 that Calabasas is bound to follow rules set by Los Angeles County 
until the city establishes its own land-use plan. The city lost an appeal of 
that decision in January. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 After the 1993 ruling, Calabasas approved an "urgency" ordinance, giving 
itself more control over planning decisions until it finished its own General 
Plan. In her ruling Wednesday, Judge Wayne called the law arbitrary and 
capricious and overturned it. 
</P>
<P>
 William Fulton, publisher of California Planning and Development Report, said 
the series of rulings may provide a lesson to cities that incorporate in the 
future. 
</P>
<P>
 "From now on, new cities are going to have to be more forward-thinking from 
Day 1," Fulton said. "To avoid this type of trap, they're going to pass 
Calabasas' urgency ordinance, but they're going to do it from the beginning."

NEW RESEARCH TO SPARE SIMI LAB FROM CLOSURE; SCIENCE: THE DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY, 
WHICH HAD PLANNED TO SHUT DOWN THE SITE, WILL STUDY A NEW TECHNOLOGY FOR 
ELECTRICAL GENERATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Department of Energy announced Thursday that it will keep open its Energy 
Technology Engineering Center near Simi Valley to do research on a promising 
new technology for electrical power generation, known as the Kalina Cycle. 
</P>
<P>
 The center had been scheduled for closure in September, with a loss of 200 
high-tech jobs. It is operated by the Rocketdyne division of Rockwell 
International, which for decades tested components for nuclear power plants at 
the site. 
</P>
<P>
 "The issue in my mind was that we cannot lose this resource," Energy Secretary 
Hazel O'Leary said Thursday at a news conference in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The center, part of the Department of Energy's Santa Susana Field Laboratory, 
is now assured funding through 1995 and will get a budget hike of $11.6 
million, most of it to test the new technology, a prototype of which is already 
in place. 
</P>
<P>
 Community groups and proponents of an advanced transportation industry in 
Southern California have been lobbying hard to keep the site open. In December, 
DOE successfully sought out industrial partners to help support the center's 
continued operation. 
</P>
<P>
 "The future of ETEC really gives us something positive to look forward to," 
said Bonny Matheson, president of Valley Industry and Commerce Assn., which 
represents more than 350 businesses in Ventura and Los Angeles counties. 
Matheson also spoke at Thursday's news conference. 
</P>
<P>
 The energy technology center's mission to develop cleaner and more efficient 
energy systems could also help create more jobs and give local businesses a 
much-needed boost, said Matheson, who met with O'Leary in February to talk 
about saving the $1-billion lab. 
</P>
<P>
 "Businesses have been so battered after years of tragedy and disaster that 
this is just a wonderful ray of light," Matheson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Anthony Beilenson (D-Woodland Hills) helped arrange the meeting between 
O'Leary and business leaders. "We hope we can look back in a couple of years 
and see that this not only saved jobs but created other jobs," Beilenson said. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Leary said Thursday that future funding will depend on how successful the 
center is in attracting private businesses interested in working with the 
facility. Southern California Gas Co. has already expressed interest in working 
with the center to develop new uses for natural gas, and Caltrans is also 
interested in using the lab. 
</P>
<P>
 "We still think that a focus on transportation technologies is a premiere use 
of the site, and we will be working to get DOE's additional support," said John 
Slifko, special assistant for technology policy to Rep. Howard L. Berman 
(D-Panorama City). 
</P>
<P>
 But so far, plans focus on development of the new electricity-generation 
process, Robert LeChevalier, DOE site manager, said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a really significant event," LeChevalier said. "It's the first new 
thermodynamic cycle that's been invented since 1895." 
</P>
<P>
 The new concept was devised by Alexander Kalina, an engineer from the former 
Soviet Union now living in Northern California. Potentially, it could use 
almost any heat source -- fueled by natural gas, coal or geothermal or solar 
energy -- to produce electricity 20% more efficiently than current turbine 
technology. 
</P>
<P>
 An improvement of this magnitude could mean billions of dollars in energy 
savings in this country and internationally. The technology center has the 
world's sole operating model of the device. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've demonstrated the principles of the cycle," LeChevalier said, "and a 
number of large utility suppliers are very interested . . . one is General 
Electric." 
</P>
<P>
 The center also has ongoing projects in renewable technologies, energy 
conservation and earthquake-effects testing. Researchers there can test the 
effects of seismic events on components used to isolate buildings and bridges 
from earthquake impacts, or such utility structures as pipe systems in power 
plants.

14-YEAR-OLD IS CONVICTED IN SLAYING OF FRIEND, 9 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A 14-year-old boy, on trial as a juvenile, has been found guilty of 
second-degree murder after he shot and killed a 9-year-old friend in a Glendale 
apartment over the summer. 
</P>
<P>
 The verdict was announced Wednesday in Pasadena Juvenile Court, where 
prosecution and defense attorneys wrangled during a three-day trial over what 
was considered the main issue: whether the teen-ager acted with implied malice. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically, for second-degree murder, you commit the act intentionally, 
knowing the danger with a subjective awareness of the risk," Deputy Dist. Atty. 
Laura Foland-Priver said. "I felt from the beginning it was a second-degree 
murder. That was always our theory, and that's exactly what we wanted." 
</P>
<P>
 The teen-ager, whose identity is being withheld because of his age, is 
scheduled to be sentenced May 3 and faces a maximum of 11 years at the 
California Youth Authority. 
</P>
<P>
 He and the victim, Sang Lee, lived in the same apartment complex in the 1200 
block of Virginia Avenue. By most accounts, they were close friends who often 
enjoyed playing together. 
</P>
<P>
 The teen-ager told police that he invited Lee to his apartment to watch 
television around noon Aug. 12. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon after they finished, the older boy went to a living room cabinet and 
pulled out his father's .38-caliber revolver from a shoe box, intending to 
scare the boy with it. 
</P>
<P>
 The teen-ager loaded the gun with one bullet and pulled the trigger twice -- 
hitting the fourth-grader in the chest on the second try. He told police that 
he unloaded the gun immediately after the shooting, returned it to the cabinet 
and dialed 911. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee died less than an hour later at Glendale Adventist Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Public Defender Enrique Marinez declined to comment. Commissioner Karen 
J. Nudell, who ruled in the case, was unavailable for comment Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 But Foland-Priver said Nudell based her verdict on many things. 
</P>
<P>
 "She listed several of the minor's actions, which she felt were important in 
deciding a second-degree," the deputy district attorney said. "She felt the 
fact he was doing it to scare the victim was important. The fact that he 
unloaded the gun and returned it to the cabinet was significant. 
</P>
<P>
 "A combination of all the facts, each of his actions, his reason to do it, she 
considered important in reaching second-degree murder."

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; MORE HEARINGS ON COMPOST PLAN ORDERED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEANNETTE REGALADO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After testimony from Antelope Valley residents about the ill effects a 
proposed composting facility would have on their community, the Los Angeles 
County Board of Supervisors unanimously voted to send the proposal back to the 
Regional Planning Commission for additional public hearings. 
</P>
<P>
 The board also ordered Bio Gro Systems Inc., which owns the site, to do a 
environmental impact report before a renewal of its conditional use permit is 
reviewed. 
</P>
<P>
 The most dramatic testimony came from Giovanna Galeazzi, 36, of Lancaster, who 
lives across the street from the Bio Gro site. She told the board that her four 
children have suffered from dizziness and nausea since the facility started to 
handle the city's sludge in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 "The smell is inside our home, outside our home," said Galeazzi. "I am very 
concerned for my family." 
</P>
<P>
 Galeazzi said any expansion of the site, which can now handle 100 tons of 
sludge a day, would seriously impact her children's health. The sludge is 
injected into the ground or spread on the surface for fertilization of alfalfa 
and barley crops. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Deane Dana suggested sending the matter back to the Regional 
Planning Commission after Supervisor Mike Antonovich, who represents the area, 
recommended that the conditional use permit be denied. 
</P>
<P>
 "I support composting," Antonovich said. "But I share their conviction that 
this site is not a suitable location for such a facility." 
</P>
<P>
 Tharon Garber of Bio Gro said extensive research has been done on the effects 
of the facility on the sparsely populated area. Garber insisted there are no 
dangers. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is unfortunate because all the information is already in the report," 
Garber said. "This just puts it back to the public review process." 
</P>
<P>
 In December, the Regional Planning Commission granted a conditional use permit 
to Bio Gro to build a composting facility. The approval was appealed by the 
Antelope Acres Town Council. 
</P>
<P>
 Bio Gro wants to use 67 acres of its 640-acre ranch for the facility. About 
500 tons of sludge a day from Los Angeles waste treatment plants would be 
trucked to the ranch.  
</P>
<P>
 The site, which is located at Avenue A and 140th Street near the Kern County 
line, emits a strong stench, according to residents. Residents also fear the 
sludge could contaminate ground water.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; DISTRICT ADOPTS AIDS EDUCATION PROGRAM; 
SCHOOLS: SULPHUR SPRINGS TRUSTEES VOTE TO MAKE PILOT INSTRUCTION OFFERED IN 
MARCH AN ANNUAL EVENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A voluntary AIDS education program initially feared too explicit for 
elementary school children will now be offered annually by the Sulphur Springs 
School District. 
</P>
<P>
 Trustees voted 4 to 0 Wednesday night to make the pilot program a regularly 
scheduled event, a decision fueled by favorable comments from the 71 parents 
who participated in it. Trustee Gary DeRevere was absent. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that everyone was very positive," said Trustee Kerry Clegg. "It (the 
program) met exactly what our expectations and our needs were." 
</P>
<P>
 Only one survey respondent said the instruction, offered in March, didn't 
provide an adequate opportunity to talk about AIDS with their children, and 
only three residents found the material inappropriate for their children. 
</P>
<P>
 When the voluntary AIDS instruction was first proposed, critics said it would 
be too explicit for young children. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we were very sensitive to those parents and . . . everything we 
presented (was) age-appropriate," said board President Ethelyn Glancy. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers say they are pleased, but not surprised by the approval. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's consistent with the fact they decided to take a strong stand to do this 
in the first place," said Marc Winger, assistant superintendent of 
instructional services who helped organize and teach the program. 
</P>
<P>
 The program format will remain the same in future presentations, but may be 
offered in the fall semester rather than the spring, Winger said. 
</P>
<P>
 Information was presented in three meetings, with parents attending along with 
their children, and the AIDS material modified for each grade level. Winger, a 
registered nurse, a college health science professor and a local AIDS expert 
conducted the meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 The largest attendance, 125, was at the kindergarten through second-grade 
session. About 50 attended the sessions for third- and fourth-graders and 
fifth- and sixth-graders. Two AIDS presentations in January prefaced the 
program and featured more explicit information for parents only. 
</P>
<P>
 In the March meetings, the youngest children were told about the importance of 
good health and hygiene habits, were asked if they had heard about acquired 
immune deficiency syndrome and were reassured they couldn't catch the disease. 
</P>
<P>
 Children in the third and fourth grades learned AIDS was an attack on the 
immune system and involved bodily fluids. Those in the fifth and sixth grades 
were told about transmission of the disease.

 Two men were killed on Sierra Highway shortly before rush hour when their 
vehicles collided head-on north of Mint Canyon Road. 
</P>
<P>
 Carlos Horton of Acton and Leros Hull of Valencia, both 51, died shortly after 
the 4:44 p.m. accident Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Horton's pickup truck was traveling north on Sierra Highway and pulled into 
the southbound lane, hitting Hull's car, California Highway Patrol Officer 
Wendy Moore said. 
</P>
<P>
 Each vehicle was traveling 50 to 60 m.p.h. when the collision occurred. Both 
men were wearing seat belts, and the car's air bag deployed in the collision, 
Moore said.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; D.A. ASKED TO REVIEW VOTER ROLLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Lancaster city clerk's office has asked the Los Angeles County district 
attorney's office to review the voter registration records of about a dozen 
people who may have used phony addresses to qualify to vote in next week's 
election, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 City Clerk Barbara Howard, who began a review on Wednesday, became suspicious 
when she recognized at least two of the addresses used, said Nancy Walker, a 
city spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the addresses used to register belonged to a business and the other was 
of a residence known to Howard, Walker said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're asking the district attorney to investigate and prosecute if he finds 
violations of the law," Walker said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The April 12 election will fill three open City Council seats from a field of 
12 candidates, Walker said. In the 1992 election, 12,270 ballots were cast, 
representing about 30% of the registered voters in the city, which has about 
108,000 residents, Walker said. 
</P>
<P>
 The city did not release the names of the people who are the subjects of the 
investigation.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; MOBILE-HOME PARK MANAGERS QUIT, CITE PRESSURE 
OVER ELECTION; LANCASTER: OFFICIALS DENY THAT THE CITY ASKED THE COUPLE OR A 
COMPANY HIRED TO OPERATE THE FACILITY TO RELAX THEIR STYLE. MOVE IS CALLED A 
CAMPAIGN PLOY.

<P>
 The managers of a city-owned mobile-home park resigned Thursday, saying they 
were told to avoid enforcing rules so that park residents would not get angry 
with council members seeking reelection next week. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're trying to avoid upsetting the people so they can get their votes," 
said Dale Gillman, who until Thursday managed Brierwood Mobile Home Estates 
with his wife, Judi. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine-based Newport Pacific Capital Co. was hired in December to manage 
mobile-home parks recently purchased by the city of Lancaster. The Gillmans 
were managers under the former owner and were hired by Newport Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, the Gillmans produced a memo from a Newport Pacific manager to 
Judi Gillman stating: "In reiteration of what we just discussed, please 
maintain a conservative approach in your dealings with the residents in order 
to prevent telephone calls to the city -- especially the mayor." 
</P>
<P>
 The April 6 memo continues: "Keep in mind that this is a temporary arrangement 
and for the sake of the upcoming election." 
</P>
<P>
 City officials deny that the city asked the Gillmans or Newport Pacific to 
relax their management style for the sake of Tuesday's election, in which three 
incumbents and 10 challengers are vying for three seats. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a campaign ploy," said Steve Dukett, head of Lancaster's 
Redevelopment Agency, which oversees the three city-owned mobile-home parks. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't make judgments on major housing projects like this on the basis of 
election time," City Manager Jim Gilley said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lancaster Mayor Arnie Rodio, who is seeking reelection, said the only contact 
he has had with the mobile-home park was a call from a Brierwood resident who 
wanted to arrange a flexible space rent payment plan. He referred the caller to 
a city staff member. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was it," Rodio said. "I did not do anything but turn it over to staff. 
Period. That's my job." 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman George Root, also seeking reelection, said: "The park managers, it 
appears, were put up to this stuff by (council challenger) Deborah Shelton. I 
think it's strictly a campaign ploy." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rev. Henry Hearns, another councilman seeking reelection, could not be 
reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Sullivan, Newport Pacific executive vice president, said there were 
residents at Brierwood who wanted to use the election to obtain concessions 
from the city. He would not say what the residents were seeking but that his 
company was trying to prevent the park from becoming embroiled in local 
political battles. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the memo was "a communication to our resident manager that we're 
trying not to have anything escalate into a political situation. I don't know 
the names of the people running for election out there and I don't care." 
</P>
<P>
 The Gillmans had been resident managers at Brierwood for three months before 
the city bought the park from a private businessman. They said Thursday that 
they had been thinking of resigning since the city took over. 
</P>
<P>
 Sullivan said the couple had a hard time adjusting to the city's policies, 
which were more flexible than those of the prior owner. 
</P>
<P>
 In a written response to the Gillmans' press conference, Newport Pacific said: 
"Whether it is dinner time, springtime, election time or milking time in 
Lancaster, the Gillmans had been asked to be more flexible in dealing with 
their residents and to adhere to the management philosophy and tone that both 
Newport and the city of Lancaster wished to see at Brierwood."

STAGING AREAS; * LABS AND WORKSHOPS IN THE VALLEY GIVE PLAYWRIGHTS A FORUM FOR 
DEVELOPING THEIR WORKS IN PROGRESS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 It may be that playwright Marlane Meyer had the final word on the subject of 
new play development during a 1988 playwriting symposium significantly titled, 
"Developed to Death." Meyer said succinctly that theaters have to develop 
playwrights, not plays. "If you do the first," she added, "good plays will 
follow." 
</P>
<P>
 It's for that reason, some would argue, that playwrights such as Alan 
Ayckbourn and Lanford Wilson have been able to be so prolific while others 
flounder. Each has had theaters which have invested in them, not their 
individual plays. 
</P>
<P>
 So, is the usual process, in which theaters work on one play at a time, all 
washed up? Not at all, judging by visits to a variety of Valley-based theaters 
and playwriting groups. 
</P>
<P>
 (The Hollywood area doesn't monopolize such labs and workshops. The Valley 
lays claim to several, and no two are quite alike, including age: The Road 
Theatre Company has been in Van Nuys for less than 12 months, while Theatre 
East's writer-director workshop is 32 this year.) 
</P>
<P>
 They are alike, though, in that the workshops allow playwrights to test the 
waters with new works. Meyer would be unhappy to know that none of the hosting 
theaters invests in the playwright; then again, few American theaters do. 
</P>
<P>
 This survey found every type of lab / workshop. There is the most rudimentary 
(and most intimate) kind -- practiced by Golden West Playwrights in Van Nuys 
and the Writers Group in North Hollywood -- in which writers sit in a circle, 
read works in progress and offer comments. 
</P>
<P>
 There is the sit-down reading of an early draft, most often by actor members 
of the hosting theater. Such readings vary: A Road Theatre reading of Judy 
O'Sullivan's tragi-comedy, "The Finalist," has a small invited audience and no 
post-reading critique. Interact Theatre Company readings of a section of 
Richard Broadhurst's satiric "The Dead Man Wore a Dress" and Joseph Rubanoff's 
drama, "78," conclude with a probing critique session almost as long as the 
pieces. 
</P>
<P>
 The next evolutionary phase of play development tends to be the stand-up 
reading, with actors still on script. Depending on the theater, the playwright 
-- even at this phase -- can hear the play with truly talented actors. Skip 
Usen enjoys that benefit at Theatre West, where his black comedy, "If You Had 
Six Holes in You, You'd Be Dead, Too" can have a cast with such veterans as Tom 
Dahlgren, Len Lesser and Marvin Kaplan. 
</P>
<P>
 A major phase, before a full production, is the rehearsed and staged reading. 
In the case of Christopher Williams' cop drama, "A Style of Sympathy" at Group 
Repertory Theatre in North Hollywood, there are light and sound cues. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, a piece may receive a workshop production. This is the stuff of 
"Interactivity," a two-week festival of new works, solo pieces and classics 
continuing at Interact through April 17. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the phase, and whether it's held under the auspices of a theater or 
by a group of writers who have banded together for each other, the key word is 
"process." 
</P>
<P>
 Process is what Williams seems a tad tired of the second night of a two-night 
"run" of a rehearsed staging of "A Style of Sympathy." The performance is over 
and the audience -- largely friends of the theater and friends of Williams -- 
are giving notes. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams is very young for this kind of thing -- 23 -- a recent graduate of 
Whittier College, and finding that his violent, scatological, intensely male 
play is on the fast track at Group Rep. It has gone from baby steps of a 
sit-down reading of the script in August, 1993, to this adolescent phase of 
script-in-hand performance, and may achieve adulthood in full production.  
</P>
<P>
 No one can say why, exactly. The normal pace of a play's development in the 
theater's playwrights group is two years, minimum. Williams is silently taking 
in a flurry of emotional, astute and challenging comments, until someone asks 
him what he thinks his play is about. Group Rep artistic director Lonnie 
Chapman interjects, "Harold Pinter wouldn't answer that." Williams does, 
probably to the frustration of the questioner: "Good is evil, and evil is 
good." 
</P>
<P>
 Does Williams have any use for the verbal notes and queries? "This was a good 
crowd, much better than last night, but these people were like 'Alien,' right 
on my face. Some wanted more, some wanted less. We do know that we gotta trim 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 In many of the labs, the work isn't as far along as Williams', so trimming 
isn't an issue. In Donna Robb's case, with her untitled work in progress being 
read at Theatre East's Thursday writer-director workshop in Studio City, the 
issue is "The Scenes That Weren't There."  
</P>
<P>
 Robb is in the midst of writing her first play, a drama blending a 
father-daughter conflict regarding the missing mother (who's in a mental 
institution) with the daughter's budding romance with a nice guy named Joe. The 
reading, though, includes only the scenes with Joe, not with Dad. 
</P>
<P>
 Robb's audience, strictly Theater East members (of which there are 
approximately 110), gropes through a post-reading critique. One member wants 
the Joe scenes to be more "realistic," but Robb says that isn't her aim. They 
like her way with dialogue; they don't like the cliches. 
</P>
<P>
 The play started as a six-page scene and has grown, reading by reading, to a 
two-act. Clearly, the process is getting results. Still, Robb says, "It's a 
hellish, terrifying, embarrassing experience. The next step is to put all the 
scenes together for another reading." 
</P>
<P>
 Theatre East has a reputation for being about readings. "I had a parting of 
the ways with them," says Dennis Connor, director of new-play development at 
the Actors' Company in Burbank, "because all they wanted to do was projects and 
endlessly workshop things." Yet the work read after Robb's is "The Triumph of 
Mave," a play by Victoria Thompson slated for a full production at Theatre East 
this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mave," set during the 1890s British suffragette movement, is one indication 
that the new plays being written are not just set around a kitchen sink in the 
1990s. Contemporary L.A. playwrights are actually writing history plays; 
indeed, no less than two get a reading around the intimate Golden West circle 
on a sunny Saturday morning in the Road Theatre's upstairs loft. Jon Bastian's 
"The Wonder of the World" deals with the dark side of show biz in the 1880s, 
while Joseph Puterbaugh's "The Roaring Girl," written in precise period 
cadence, concerns a female highway robber in 1611. 
</P>
<P>
 The discussion of these works tends to focus on language. For other works in 
progress, such as a 10-minute piece by Golden West coordinator Barbara Lindsay, 
"Todd and Guy Go Camping," discussion flows around such favored workshop 
questions as "What's the event?" (Translation: What is it that gets these 
people into a dramatic situation?) 
</P>
<P>
 The Golden West members have been around each other as long as 11 years, 
maintaining the low-key atmosphere of friends. They, nevertheless, are open to 
new members. Zavaglia says his four-year-old group can't take new members. 
Newcomers, however, may audit the workshops. 
</P>
<P>
 The heart of the development process, says Doug Haverty, who with Arden Lewis 
leads the Theatre West playwriting workshop, is the writer hearing the play 
live with an audience. "What you see on stage, in the audience, is a chemical 
reaction," says Haverty, also a member of Group Rep. "It's an education to see 
an audience fidgeting in the seats." 
</P>
<P>
 That chemical reaction, though, can be risky, says Connor of the Actors' 
Company: "There's nothing tougher than working all alone on a play for two 
years, have it read on stage, and realize that it's really lousy. You want to 
go into a hole and die. But the serious writer faces up to the criticism, goes 
home, works on it and comes back. That's how it happens."

THEATER REVIEW; MUSICAL HAS THE LAUGHS BUT NOT THE LOOKS; * THE TACKY SET 
DESIGN TAKES AWAY FROM THE SATIRIC VIRTUES OF 'VAMPIRE ASYLUM MALIBU POINT.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It's not easy to be sucked into "Vampire Asylum Malibu Point," a horror 
musical comedy at the West End Playhouse in Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's the quandary: The show enjoys a good, original rockabilly score (by 
composer Kyle Moore); sexy, humorous casting, and genuinely ripe performances 
(particularly the voluptuous, delightful Jenie Lyn as an 
innocent-maiden-turned-vampira). But its considerable satiric and musical 
virtues are severely compromised by the production's derivative, hokey plot and 
tacky-to-wretched set design. 
</P>
<P>
 Too often, small theater will ignore the effort to create an artful set 
(usually on the limp reasoning that there's no money for it), in the hope that 
the show is otherwise strong enough to get by with ragged props and a bare 
scrim or two. 
</P>
<P>
 The result, in the case of "Vampire Asylum," is a show that is a patchwork 
instead of a whole work. 
</P>
<P>
 The producers are so indifferent to the look and texture of the stage that 
they don't even sweep off the playing area. The stage floor, the black curtain 
at stage rear -- everything looks so dreary a patron might figure that, well, 
if they don't care, why should I? 
</P>
<P>
 Even astute lighting (Jeff Croot Gafford) and spirited costume design (Laura 
Comstock) don't compensate for the physical bleakness (not to be confused with 
the dark, ominous material). A creative set, i.e. some visual imagination, even 
if it's austere, distinguishes the small-theater professionals, even those who 
are broke. 
</P>
<P>
 Otherwise, to parody that famous theater line -- "Other than that, how did you 
like the play?" -- director John Comstock and co-playwrights Larry Transue and 
Mary Comstock have fashioned a rather breezy little sendup of every vampire 
movie and play you've ever seen. 
</P>
<P>
 The plot centers on a stranded brother and sister (surfin' dude Matt Kenna and 
the no-nonsense Jenie Lyn) who stumble upon "The Tourist Trap," a Malibu beach 
resort run by a fangy guy in a cape who likes Bloody Marys (the preening, 
well-cast Garrett House, who tends to unnecessarily shout his lines). 
</P>
<P>
 Kathryn Bundy's vivacious vampire hunter, composer Kyle Moore doubling as an 
amusingly nerdy and naive banker, and Ariana Johns and Barbara Minardi as a 
lustful pair of towering vampire brides flesh out the biting satire. 
</P>
<P>
 The show's sexual antics are mildly and amusingly risque, which sets just the 
right tone. The show's essential freshness, though, besides Lyn's airy 
deftness, is Moore's music (a seven-person band projected via tape). 
</P>
<P>
 Kenna and Lyn's unexpected Malibu visitors are knockout vocalists who, with 
support from Bundy and House, peal off some rousing lyrics in such numbers as 
"Just a Bite," "Surfin' Isn't Everything" and "Mirrors Are for Mortals." What: 
"Vampire Asylum Malibu Point." 
</P>
<P>
 Location: West End Playhouse, 7446 Van Nuys Blvd., Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
 Hours: 8 p.m. Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays; 3 p.m. Sundays. Ends April 24. 
</P>
<P>
 Price: $15.

YOU CAN SATISFY YOUR TASTE BUDS WITH SOME HARD-TO-FIND, REGIONAL DISHES.

<P>
 You don't have to be hungry, pregnant or bored to get a hankering for a 
favoritefood. The mood strikes when you least expect it -- in that important 
meeting with the boss, sitting frozen in traffic on the freeway, looking at the 
VCR on your day off. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of us hanker for regional specialties that brought us comfort as 
children: Polish sausages, Cornish pasties, Louisiana gumbo, a great bagel. I 
hanker for lots of different foods and sometimes do not know where to find 
them. So for the last month or so, I've been searching for certain foods, a few 
suggested by colleagues, a few my own favorites. Please drop me a note if there 
is something you can't find. If it's out there, I may just feature it in a 
second list. 1. Cinnamon Cake Doughnut  
</P>
<P>
 Every now and again, I long for an old-fashioned American doughnut, the dense, 
crumbly cake once a fixture at picnics and church outings. Du-par's Coffee Shop 
is thought by many to have the San Fernando Valley's best pancakes, but I never 
get to them. Their firm, fat cinnamon cake doughnut, the kind that breaks apart 
in the mouth in a cascade of crumbs, is my favorite doughnut in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 It's laced with a healthy pinch of nutmeg, the cake itself colored a light, 
cafe au lait shade of brown. I ordered one a couple of weeks ago along with an 
espresso, and the waitress looked at me as if I was off my rocker. "How you 
gonna dip a doughnut into an espresso?" she queried. 
</P>
<P>
 Du-par's Coffee Shop, 12036 Ventura Blvd., Studio City, (818) 766-4437. Open 6 
a.m. to 1 a.m. Sundays through Thursdays, 6 a.m. to 4 a.m. Fridays and 
Saturdays. Doughnut, 95 cents. 2. Polish Sausage  
</P>
<P>
 People from Chicago dream of tomato-rich Chicago beef sandwiches, jumbo hot 
dogs called red hots and Polish sausages. Chicago native Norm Rubin owns 
Rubin's Red Hots, the Valley's best hot dog stand, which you spot by first 
locating a 17-foot section of authentic Chicago El track. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our Polish isn't as spicy or fatty as a lot of the dogs out there," Rubin 
said. Nonetheless, it's a real winner. This is a sweet, juicy sausage encased 
in one of Rubin's terrific onion-studded buns, offset perfectly by a heap of 
sweetish sauerkraut and prepared mustard. Rubin has them flown in from the 
Second City a couple of times weekly. The Red Hot, at $2.90, is a bigger seller 
than the Polish. It's the quintessential hot dog, complete with all the 
trimmings. Think of the Polish as the sausage for purists. It doesn't need all 
the relishes and toppings to stand up for itself. 
</P>
<P>
 Rubin's Red Hot, 15322 Ventura Blvd., Sherman Oaks, (818) 905-6515. 11 a.m. to 
9 p.m. Sundays through Thursdays, 11 a.m. to 10 p.m. Fridays and Saturdays. 
Chicago Polish, $3.45. 3. Egg Cream  
</P>
<P>
 The egg cream got its name because it contains no egg, no cream -- sort of a 
New York joke. I'm told that it was at its best at a candy store called the Gem 
Spa, on Manhattan's 2nd Avenue. You can make one at home using Fox's U-Bet 
syrup and club soda, but it always tastes better at a soda fountain. 
</P>
<P>
 But whether served in a paper cone or a tall, cool glass, this frothy drink 
has to be made with soda water, ice-cold milk and some kind of chocolate syrup. 
I brought a native New Yorker to Brent's Deli in Northridge, which I think 
makes the Southland's best egg cream, and he pronounced it above average. The 
foam on this drink is about two inches thick, the liquid underneath zippy and 
chocolatey. I was impressed enough to order seconds. He barely finished his. 
</P>
<P>
 Brent's, 19565 Parthenia St., Northridge, (818) 349-9850. Open 6 a.m. to 9 
p.m. daily. Egg cream, $1.75. 4. Five-Way Chili  
</P>
<P>
 One of our staffers is from Cincinnati, where something called Skyline Chili 
is a local sensation. I've been to Cincinnati and I've had this stuff, an 
aromatically spiced chili originally made from a Greek chef's recipe. Frankly, 
I think I missed something. 
</P>
<P>
 Chili John's in Burbank is our local cult chili parlor. This small cafe serves 
up five-way chili -- to use Cincinnati lingo -- with beans, spaghetti, cheese 
and onions. Chili John's got its start in Green Bay, Wis., of all places. I've 
eaten there, but after a few steins of dark beer, all chili tastes good. 
</P>
<P>
 This chili is basic, ground meat, lots of cumin, enough oil to power a small 
tugboat. You eat it in great bowls at a long, circular counter in the shadow of 
an Alpine mural. This is a handsome little cafe, but I'm not enamored of this 
chili, and the spaghetti underneath is far from al dente. There's a chicken 
chili here, too, less greasy with a cleaner finish. 
</P>
<P>
 Chili John's, 2088 Burbank Blvd., Burbank, (818) 846-3611. Open 11 a.m. to 7 
p.m. Tuesdays through Fridays, 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. Saturdays, closed Sundays and 
Mondays. Chili with spaghetti and beans, $4.85. 5. Pasty  
</P>
<P>
 Gary Hirn hails from Escanaba, in Upper Michigan, where the pasty is king. At 
his Guppy's Pasty Shop in North Hollywood, you get a filling meal in a crust 
for under $2. 
</P>
<P>
 The pasty, a.k.a. Cornish pasty, is one of the last vestiges of culture from 
ancient Cornwall at the southwestern tip of England, and a place that lost its 
Celtic language (related to Welsh) during the late 17th Century. You still find 
pasties in Wisconsin and Michigan -- simple, hearty short-crust pies stuffed 
with a meat, potato and carrot filling. Hirn's are delicious, and he makes four 
varieties; the traditional beef, chicken, chili beef and chili chicken. 
</P>
<P>
 About the only drawback is the entrance to the place, hard to spot in the rear 
of a corner strip mall. 
</P>
<P>
 Guppy's Pasty Shop, 12849 Sherman Way, North Hollywood, (818) 982-5109. Open 6 
a.m. to 4 p.m. Mondays through Saturdays. Pasty, $1.75. 6. Strawberry Rhubarb 
Pie  
</P>
<P>
 Rhubarb is real farm food. In the country, they put it up in jars and bake it 
in pies. 
</P>
<P>
 It's difficult to find rhubarb pie in the big city, although it seems to be 
something a lot of people hanker for. However, at Barron's Family Restaurant in 
Burbank, you get wholesome strawberry rhubarb pie almost every day of the week. 
It's a crusty, sweet-tart pie, latticed with a Crisco crust much like a cherry 
pie, and it's great with a mid-afternoon cup of coffee. 
</P>
<P>
 Owner Gordon Barron worked for Du-par's more than 32 years; it's where, he 
claims, he concocted the original recipe for the pancake batter. Today, he runs 
this modest, old-style cafe, full of faded vinyl booths and bygone-era 
customers, with daughter Connie Trimble. Also come to Barron's for hearty 
Americana such as pan-fried chicken and home-style meatloaf. 
</P>
<P>
 Barron's Family Restaurant, 4130 W. Burbank Blvd., Burbank, (818) 846-0043. 
Open 7 a.m. to 7:30 p.m. Mondays through Fridays, 8 a.m. to 1 p.m. Saturdays. 
Strawberry rhubarb pie, $2.05. 7. Barbecued Lamb Sandwich  
</P>
<P>
 The Bear Pit is a dark, homey place with a sawdust-covered floor and 
wagon-wheel chandeliers. Diners sit on wood-slat benches at unadorned tables. 
</P>
<P>
 The best thing to eat here is something you may not find anywhere else in 
Southern California, a barbecued lamb sandwich. The sandwich is usually sold on 
a French roll or sesame seed bun, but for a dollar extra, you can have it on 
garlic toast, the best way to go. The lamb is lean, thinly sliced and 
generously stacked; the thick garlic toast a magical companion for it. Dip the 
sandwich in the restaurant's smoke-flavored, mustardy barbecue sauce. The 
combination is close to perfection. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bear Pit, 10825 Sepulveda Blvd., Mission Hills, (818) 365-2500. Open from 
11:30 a.m. to 10 p.m. daily. Barbecued lamb sandwich, $5.25. 8. Callie Mae's 
Cactus Twigs  
</P>
<P>
 Wild Bill's, an oddly shaped, free-standing building on upper Vineland Avenue, 
is painted on the outside with tall, Kermit the Frog-green saguaro cactus. 
Maybe you've never had a craving for the restaurant's Callie Mae's cactus 
twigs, spears of nopalito cactus coated with a crusty, spicy cornmeal batter, 
but the food is addictive -- fried zucchini pales before it. 
</P>
<P>
 The fry cook plunges the crisp, sweetly medicinal spears into a deep fryer for 
the perfect amount of time, and they come out hot and juicy. Regular customers 
like to eat them with the restaurant's "flamin' Injun hot sauce," one of the 
hottest barbecue sauces in the entire city. 
</P>
<P>
 Wild Bill's Bar-B-Que, 5342 Vineland Ave., North Hollywood, (818) 752-4557. 
Open 24 hours daily. Callie Mae's cactus twigs, $4. 9. Bialy  
</P>
<P>
 There are lots of great bagels in Los Angeles, but I prefer the dense, chewy 
ones sold by a chain called I & Joy, which has locations scattered around the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
 The bialy is not exactly a bagel, although it is made from boiled, baked dough 
in the exact same way. It takes its name from a town called Bialystok in 
eastern Poland, has no center hole and has a crunchy topping made from grizzled 
onions, garlic and salt. I & Joy bagels contain no cholesterol, no fat and low 
sodium, but if you slice one in two and smear both halves with the chain's good 
lox and cream cheese spread, like I do, you can throw away the nutritional 
guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
 I & Joy, 16060 Ventura Blvd., Encino, (818) 501-9267. Open 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. 
daily; 11156 Balboa Blvd., Granada Hills, (818) 363-9843. Open 6 a.m. to 6 
p.m.; 18539 Devonshire St., Northridge, (818) 363-9879. Open 6 a.m. to 6 p.m.; 
7535 Fallbrook Ave., Canoga Park, (818) 992-9792. Open 7 a.m. to 2 p.m.; 11974 
Ventura Blvd., Studio City, (818) 760-9068. Open 5 a.m. to 6 p.m. Bialy, 50 
cents, or $4.75 a dozen. 10. File Gumbo  
</P>
<P>
 Until she passed away in 1992, Oklahoma native Clara Huling prepared one of 
the tastier gumbos this side of Baton Rouge in her modest Chatsworth cafe. And 
now her son, Kevin, carries on the tradition. It's a dark, murky version 
thickened with a light flour roux and real file -- a mixture of powdered 
sassafras and thyme, chock-full of shrimp, sausage, rice and the surprise 
addition of mussels. A friend raved about the sausage, and we all took turns 
guessing what it was. 
</P>
<P>
 "I played around with several sausages until I found the one I liked," Huling 
later divulged. "Believe it or not, the sausage that tastes best comes from 
Farmer John." Call in advance, because it isn't available every day. 
</P>
<P>
 Les Sisters, 21818 Devonshire St., Chatsworth, (818) 998-0755. Lunch 11 a.m. 
to 2:30 p.m. Tuesdays through Fridays; dinner 5 to 9 p.m. Tuesdays, Wednesdays, 
Thursdays and Sundays, 5 to 10 p.m. Fridays and Saturdays. File gumbo, $5.95. 
11. Cuban-Style Chinese Fried Rice  
</P>
<P>
 Lots of my New Yorker friends hanker for the Cuban/Chinese dishes you find in 
plenty on the Upper West Side. We have lots of Cuban restaurants, but none of 
them really cross over to Chinese dishes the way they do in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 El Criollo in Van Nuys, however, will cook up Chinese-style fried rice on 
request, if the order is big enough. It's a nondescript little cafe where you 
eat garlic chicken, yucca and black beans. I'm told this rice, made with egg, 
ham, scallions, chicken, maybe even shrimp (depending on the whim of the cook), 
is fluffy, fragrant and just like it is in Manhattan. I can't say, though. I 
haven't gotten to eat it in three visits. 
</P>
<P>
 El Criollo, 13245 Victory Blvd., Van Nuys, (818) 760-9883. Cuban-style Chinese 
fried rice, call for hours and prices. 12. Rotisserie Chicken  
</P>
<P>
 One hankering easy to satisfy is that for good rotisserie chicken. The dish 
has gotten so popular, even the Colonel has jumped onto the bandwagon. 
</P>
<P>
 There is, however, one place that sets the standard, Glendale's Zankou 
Chicken, the best cheap meal around. 
</P>
<P>
 It's an airy cafe fueled by three enormous metal rotisseries, each of which 
cook up to 50 chickens at one time on rotating metal spits. 
</P>
<P>
 The chicken comes out crisp, golden brown, juicy and fragrant. Most people eat 
this chicken with an intense white garlic sauce, triangles of steamy pita 
bread, pickled turnips and roasted peppers, but it is great on its own. 
</P>
<P>
 The Colonel's doesn't even come close. 
</P>
<P>
 Zankou Chicken, 1415 E. Colorado St., Unit D, Glendale, (818) 244-1937. Open 
10 a.m. to 11 p.m. daily. Half-chicken, $3.25.

PRESERVING THE PASTORAL; NEIGHBORS OPPOSE AFFORDABLE HOUSING PLAN FOR 
SADDLEBACK MEADOWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELAINE TASSY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fearing drugs and crime, some residents here have organized to block the 
proposed development of affordable housing on a scenic 240-acre site off El 
Toro Road. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors want the lush, hilly land surrounding a monastery to be left alone 
and the rural ambience of their neighborhood to remain untouched. 
</P>
<P>
 In a huge point of contention, the residents believe Los Angeles-based 
developer Aradi Inc. plans to build a park for 708 mobile homes that would be 
marketed to lower-income people. 
</P>
<P>
 Resident Patti Kacsir, who opposes development, said: "There's nothing wrong 
with poor people. But there is something wrong with people who put things in 
their bodies and steal things from others to do it. A low-income area is a 
prime location for a drug house. You don't have a low-income, high-density 
development on the edge of a family park." 
</P>
<P>
 However, the developer, who bought the property out of bankruptcy last June, 
flatly denies that it intends to build a mobile home park. Officials said they 
are considering applying to the county for approval to erect a 708-unit 
affordable housing complex for senior citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let me make (it) very clear: We have never told anyone there would be mobile 
homes on that site. There will be no mobile homes," said Paul Sevey, vice 
president of development at Aradi. "We have had some conversations with the 
county staff (about) doing an age-restricted planned community." 
</P>
<P>
 But local residents said they would not want a seniors housing project either, 
saying it would be too much development on the property. 
</P>
<P>
 The area in dispute is known as Saddleback Meadows. It surrounds most of St. 
Michael's Abbey, a 35-year-old monastery that operates a boarding school for 
boys. 
</P>
<P>
 With the mobile home development they are convinced is coming, alarmed 
residents, most of whom spent about $250,000 for their homes, contend that 
police services, schools and roadways will be overburdened by the influx of new 
people and that their property values will nose-dive. 
</P>
<P>
 Angela Zarzki is also concerned that extensive grading for development will 
ruin her home's panoramic view, for which she paid an extra $30,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just like it out here, and so far, we don't have much crime. We'd like to 
see it remain open space," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The clergy is not any happier about the situation. 
</P>
<P>
 A lot of new people would make living in the abbey "like living in a 
fishbowl," said the Rev. Vincent Gilmore of St. Michael's. 
</P>
<P>
 The project would be incompatible with quiet meditation and prayer -- among 
the primary activities at the monastery, said Gilmore. "You're going to have an 
overgrowth of people who are not going to respect our way of life," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the developer's claim to the contrary, residents said they firmly 
believe that a mobile home park is coming. 
</P>
<P>
 Elizabeth Wallace, who leads the residents group Portola Hills Opposition, 
said she has a November, 1993, map made by Aradi's Irvine-based engineering 
firm, Hunsaker & Associates, that shows plans for mobile homes. "I'm not sure 
who's telling the truth in this whole matter," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 A representative of the engineering firm refused to comment. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Zoning for the area allows a maximum 708-unit mobile home subdivision or 
manufactured housing, according to the county's director of planning, Tom 
Mathews. 
</P>
<P>
 County supervisors approved a land-use plan for the canyon in 1990 which 
states that development has to preserve the rural atmosphere. Also, federal 
requirements that protect the gnatcatcher, an endangered songbird that may live 
in Saddleback Meadows, may affect development. 
</P>
<P>
 However, back in 1980, an application by a previous developer to build a 
mobile home park at Saddleback Meadows was approved by the county. Since then, 
the property has changed hands several times, but the approval for a mobile 
home project is still in effect. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now when you look at this project, in my estimation, it's a horse of a 
different color," said county Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez, whose district 
includes the area. "A project that may have been considered reasonable at the 
time in this day and age has some problems. I have very, very grave concerns 
about this project. This is not a project that I would support were it . . . 
under consideration by me at this time." 
</P>
<P>
 The approval predates his term, and his staff is researching legal ways to 
fight the project. 
</P>
<P>
 The developer said it is studying the possibility of building there based on 
discussions with county officials and in the next four weeks should know if it 
is feasible. 
</P>
<P>
 Getting over such hurdles as the gnatcatcher problem and winning a grading 
permit could be difficult, if not impossible, according to Gilmore. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want (the developer) to play by the rules, and we feel that if they do . . 
. they would run into a dead end," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Vasquez will meet with residents at 7 p.m. April 26 at Portola 1 Recreational 
Center to discuss the controversy over the proposed development.

ORANGE SCHOOL WORKERS' UNION AUTHORIZES STRIKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN MILLER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Union members, including school bus drivers, food service and clerical 
workers, voted Thursday night to authorize a strike in hopes of pressuring 
school district officials to renegotiate a contract the union president called 
"ludicrous."  
</P>
<P>
 The 338-50 vote gives union officials the power to stage a sickout or a strike 
if a final meeting with officials of the Orange Unified School District fails. 
The meeting has yet to be scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
 District officials have said that if a strike occurs, they will keep the 
schools running. The biggest challenge would be transporting nearly 7,000 
students by bus and providing before- and after-school child care at 24 
elementary schools during a strike, said Jack Elsner, the district's head of 
personnel. 
</P>
<P>
 The California School Employees Assn. represents 1,160 non-teaching employees, 
including maintenance workers and day-care workers. 
</P>
<P>
 At a packed meeting at Yorba Middle School, union officials assailed the new 
contract, which reduces health benefits, imposes furloughs and empowers the 
district to lay off union employees without conferring with the union. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope this vote sends a strong message that this is it," said Becky Mayers, 
president of the California School Employees Assn., Chapter 67. "We are going 
to try one last time to negotiate, and if that doesn't work, we will take 
whatever steps necessary to make the district listen." 
</P>
<P>
 District officials could not be reached for comment Thursday. But earlier this 
week, they said the new contract is vital to keep the financially strapped 
school district afloat. 
</P>
<P>
 Classified employees, like teachers and administrators, were asked to share 
the burden of closing a $2.2-million shortfall in this year's $107-million 
budget. The contract saves the district a $484,113, according to officials. 
</P>
<P>
 The conflict began March 24 when the Board of Education imposed a contract on 
classified workers, concluding nearly 11 months of labor negotiations. 
Classified workers were angered that the contract will force union employees to 
take three furlough days and to pay as much as $87 extra per month to maintain 
current health benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 But a clause giving the district the power to lay off union employees or cut 
their hours without negotiation drew the most fire from the union. Under the 
new contract, union officials fear, the district will save on health benefits 
by laying off full-time employees and hiring part-time workers to replace them. 
(Employers do not have to provide health benefits to part-time employees.)  
</P>
<P>
 District officials have said those fears are unfounded.  
</P>
<P>
 Elsner, the district's head of personnel, also denied that the district had 
negotiated in bad faith. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have been very upfront with the union indicating our economic deficit," he 
said. "We didn't hide anything." 
</P>
<P>
 Union workers have not had a raise since 1988, and took a 2.59% pay cut last 
year.

4 TO BE TRIED FOR MURDER IN BEACH SLAYING; COURTS: JUDGE FINDS IT AND OTHER 
FELONY CHARGES JUSTIFIED AGAINST TEENS ACCUSED IN DEATH OF STUDENT STRUCK BY A 
PAINT ROLLER ROD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANNA CEKOLA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Municipal Court judge Thursday ordered four San Clemente youths to stand 
trial on murder and other felony charges in the slaying of a teen-ager whose 
head was speared by a paint roller rod. 
</P>
<P>
 After a 2 1/2-day preliminary hearing, Judge Pamela L. Iles found enough 
evidence to support nearly all the charges against the defendants, including 
allegations that gang involvement played a role in the Oct. 15 attack that 
resulted in the death of Steve Woods at Calafia Beach County Park. 
</P>
<P>
 In ordering the youths to face charges, Isles called the slaying a "stupid and 
senseless act" and commented on the pain the case has caused the families both 
of the victim and of the young defendants. 
</P>
<P>
 "The emptiness of gang honor is certainly well displayed for the community 
here," Iles said. "It should be an element of shame, rather than honor." 
</P>
<P>
 Woods, a 17-year-old high school senior from San Clemente, was a passenger in 
a vehicle pelted with rocks, beer cans, paint roller rods and other items as it 
attempted to leave the beach parking lot. He was somehow struck by a paint 
roller rod during the barrage and died several weeks later, having never 
regained consciousness. 
</P>
<P>
 He and about a dozen friends in four vehicles had gone to the beach after a 
San Clemente High School football game. 
</P>
<P>
 The defendants, Saul Penuelas, 18, his brother Hector Penuelas, 17, and Julio 
Perez Bonilla and Rogelio Vasquez Solis, both 17, each face one count of 
murder, one count of conspiracy, seven counts of assault, one count of throwing 
an item at a moving vehicle, and a gang-involvement enhancement that could 
lengthen their sentences if they are convicted in Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
 Bonilla faces an additional misdemeanor count of battery stemming from a 
confrontation with one of Woods' friends, which occurred moments before the 
barrage. 
</P>
<P>
 Iles dismissed three counts of assault against each defendant, saying there 
wasn't enough evidence to show that a third vehicle carrying three teens from 
the beach had also come under attack. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 During the hearing, sheriff's investigators testified that Woods' friends said 
they were trying to flee the beach parking lot and avoid a fight with the group 
when the fatal incident happened. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of the defendants, Saul Penuelas and Bonilla, are self-proclaimed members 
of a San Clemente gang, while the other two said they sometimes associated with 
the gang, Sgt. Russell Moore testified Thursday, reiterating earlier testimony 
by several sheriff's deputies and probation officers who interviewed the 
defendants. 
</P>
<P>
 The defendants, however, told investigators they threw items because they 
thought the drivers in the other group were trying to run them down as they 
sped by. 
</P>
<P>
 They claimed they also had been provoked during an initial altercation with 
one of Woods' friends earlier that night. The same friend had allegedly made an 
obscene gesture toward Bonilla a couple days earlier, sheriff's investigator 
Barth Massey testified Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 That youth denied making a gesture and said he pulled up to the defendants 
thinking they were friends to ask them about some parties in San Juan 
Capistrano, according to Massey.  
</P>
<P>
 A San Clemente gang expert, Sgt. Russell Moore, testified that even the 
mention of San Juan Capistrano to rival gang members from San Clemente could be 
interpreted as a challenge or a hostile move. 
</P>
<P>
 The youth was hit in the head, then drove back to where his friends, including 
Woods, were gathered and told them they should leave the area, Massey 
testified.  
</P>
<P>
 Iles said that whatever perceived insults the defendants may have suffered, 
the alleged retaliation was unjustified. The judge also noted that two of the 
three paint roller rods thrown during the incident, including the one that 
struck Woods, appeared to have been altered to make them more useful as 
weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyers for the defendants, however, argued that the injury to Woods was a 
"fluke" and that the defendants had not gone to the beach looking for trouble, 
only to hang out and drink some beer, just as Woods and his friends were doing. 
They said alleged gang involvement on the part of the defendants had nothing to 
do with the incident. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was a reactive thing, it was not a conspiracy," said Dennis McNerney, 
representing Hector Penuelas. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Public Defender Stephen J. Biskar, representing Saul Penuelas, said no 
one could have predicted that someone would be killed with a paint roller rod. 
</P>
<P>
 "This injury to Steve Woods was not a foreseeable injury," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Gary Paer argued that the case was anything but an 
accident, even if the defendants never intended to kill anyone. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have people who on their own picked up certain items, aimed those items 
and hit their targets," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The four defendants, who are being treated as adults, are among six arrested 
and charged in the case. A fifth person faces trial on murder and other felony 
charges next month, while a sixth pleaded guilty to voluntary manslaughter and 
a gang involvement enhancement and is awaiting sentencing. 
</P>
<P>
 If convicted of first-degree murder, the four juvenile defendants face 25 
years to life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 The four will be arraigned in Superior Court later this month. Paer said he 
may request dual juries in the cases to cut down the number of individual 
trials.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SAN CLEMENTE; PRIVATE CONTRACTORS TAKE ON CITY SERVICES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MESSINA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council turned over operation of four city services to the private 
contractors on Wednesday in a move that will affect 22 employees. 
</P>
<P>
 The city hopes to save $2.45 million over five years by contracting with 
private companies to perform jobs like landscape maintenance and water meter 
reading.The firms were given one-year contracts that will be reviewed next 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not contracting the whole city," said Councilman Tom Lorch. "We have a 
year to work on these and see how they turn out." 
</P>
<P>
 The council also approved a severance package for most employees involved in 
the changeover. Six of the city workers will be transferred to other city jobs; 
two employees have applied for early retirement. 
</P>
<P>
 The rest will either work for one of the new contractors or find employment 
elsewhere. The severance package includes six weeks pay. The city also is 
dividing $10,000 equally among the employees released from city service. 
</P>
<P>
 "We tried to make the transition from public to private as painless as 
possible," said Linda Kulp, city human resources manager. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides landscape maintenance and meter reading, the council authorized 
contractors for fleet services, and to stripe and mark city streets. The 
estimate for first-year savings is $487,174. 
</P>
<P>
 The contractors will begin work on May 1 with the exception of meter reading, 
which will start July 1. 
</P>
<P>
 The four city services were awarded to: 
</P>
<P>
 * Landscape West Inc., $260,306 to provide park and beach maintenance. 
</P>
<P>
 * Ryder/Managed Logistic Systems Inc., $445,285 to provide fleet services. 
</P>
<P>
 * J&S Sign Co., $91,186 to provide street striping and pavement marking. 
</P>
<P>
 * San Diego Gas & Electric, $104,000 for water meter reading. 
</P>
<P>
 San Clemente utility customers will see their water and utility bills switch 
from bimonthly to monthly to conform with the power company's accounting 
system.FRANK MESSINA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; CAMPAIGN AGAINST CHILD ABUSE BEGINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIMI KO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Child Abuse Prevention Council of Orange County this week launched its 
second annual Blue Ribbon Community Action Campaign to increase awareness and 
prevention of child abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 Council officials plan to pass out 50,000 blue ribbons this year for people to 
wear as a symbol of support for abused children. 
</P>
<P>
 Charlotte Lopez, 17, who is Miss Teen USA, said she was an abused child who 
lived in several foster homes for 13 years until she was adopted last month. 
She told her story Wednesday to a roomful of local dignitaries and children at 
the Children's Museum at La Habra. 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez, of Dorset, Vt., said the public needs to become aware of child abuse to 
be moved to do something about it. 
</P>
<P>
 "My mother, who was an alcoholic, neglected me, my sister and my brother. I 
was 2 years old and I still remember how I was malnourished and mistreated 
until police took me away from my mother," she said. "People don't like to hear 
these stories because they're too painful, but they need to be made aware. 
That's what these ribbons are all about." 
</P>
<P>
 Barbara Oliver, the council's director, added: "People feel overwhelmed with 
the issue of child abuse and don't think they can help. But pinning a blue 
ribbon on is something everybody can do." 
</P>
<P>
 Oliver said the goal is to change public behavior by making child abuse 
unacceptable. In addition, the council plans to emphasize prevention through 
education, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 15 seminars on topics ranging from incest to children's views of 
abuse and therapy for abuse survivors will be offered by the council at 
colleges and high schools throughout the county until May 5. 
</P>
<P>
 The campaign is a grass-roots effort that began when a Virginia woman, Bonnie 
Finney, tied a blue ribbon to the antenna of her car after her grandson died 
from parental beatings in 1989, Oliver said. "She chose the color blue to 
symbolize the battered and bruised body of her grandson." 
</P>
<P>
 About 38,000 cases of child abuse were reported in Orange County in 1993 -- 
more than triple the number of cases a decade ago, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem isn't going away," said Deborah Vaswani, a council board member. 
"So we need to stop child abuse from happening in the first place." 
</P>

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COSTA MESA; PROBE OF CONSPIRACY CHARGES REQUESTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 City Manager Allan L. Roeder has called for a police investigation into 
anonymous charges that top city officials conspired to try to have the City 
Council award a $100,000 consulting contract. 
</P>
<P>
 Two letters were given this week to news organizations and later reached the 
city manager. They made charges against Roeder, Mayor Sandra L. Genis, City 
Atty. Thomas A. Kathe and Finance Director Susan L. Temple. 
</P>
<P>
 The letters say officials worked to avoid the bidding process in order to make 
a "sweetheart deal" with AEF Systems Consulting Inc. The city is looking for a 
consultant to provide technical assistance in the purchase of a $3- to 
$7-million computer system to control all records, accounting and payroll and 
serve other needs. 
</P>
<P>
 Roeder said the anonymous charges are false, but he has nevertheless asked 
police to independently evaluate the allegations against him and others. A 
report will be made to the council when the police investigation is concluded. 
</P>
<P>
 Roeder also asked police to find the author of the letter, who he believes is 
a city employee. 
</P>
<P>
 The council on Monday delayed voting on a request from the Communications 
Department to approve the contract with AEF and asked for more information. 
Genis and Councilman Peter F. Buffa said in a study session before the regular 
meeting that they want further explanation of why AEF was chosen without 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
 Temple said consultants may be chosen without the competitive bidding, which 
is required for most city contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 AEF was chosen by communications director Vince Wheelan, who is responsible 
for operating the city's present computer systems. Wheelan said he studied 
other cities' computer systems, and most liked the system in Oxnard, which was 
designed with the help of AEF. 
</P>
<P>
 Temple, noting the charges of her conspiracy to help AEF, said she had never 
met or dealt with the consultants until Wheelan suggested their use. Temple 
said her staff called eight references given by the Newport Beach firm, and got 
enthusiastic recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
 They also compared the AEF proposed cost for the project with similar jobs 
done for other agencies and found it to be cheaper than many, Temple said. 
</P>
<P>
 Putting the contract out to bid would probably have added six weeks to the 
process, Temple said. Roeder said the city needs a more advanced computer 
system as soon as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have put a lot of pressure on (Wheelan) and other people in the 
organization to get on with this," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Roeder said he generally favors competitive bidding but believes Wheelan and 
Temple have done a thorough job in their selection of AEF. He will ask the two 
to present their research in writing at the council's April 18 meeting. The 
project may yet go to bid. WILLSON CUMMER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: IRVINE; NEW MIDDLE SCHOOL GOING HIGH TECH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Building plans for South Lake Middle School have been revised in a move that 
will add an extra $235,000 to the project's price and will provide the campus 
with high-tech capabilities. 
</P>
<P>
 The revisions will provide a computer network capable of supporting more than 
200 terminals throughout the campus, said Lloyd Linton, director of 
construction for the Irvine Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
 The changes will cause minor delays in completion of the Woodbridge village 
school, but Linton said it will be ready for students as planned this 
September. 
</P>
<P>
 "We should be sufficiently along to open up," he said. "Some areas might not 
be totally done yet, but we will have enough done to handle the children." 
</P>
<P>
 Landscaping work and the installation of some locks and door handles might 
have to be completed after students start school. 
</P>
<P>
 The 24-classroom, 65,000-square-foot campus is located on West Yale Loop next 
to South Meadow Elementary School. It cost about $8 million to build and will 
serve about 750 students. 
</P>
<P>
 District officials said the modification to the original building plans one 
day will make South Lake a "high-technology center" complete with computer 
workstations for students. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said the computer system will allow students to retrieve information 
from a variety of databases. Finding the money to buy all the equipment needed 
for the center will probably take several years, Linton said. 
</P>
<P>
 A key modification in the school's design involves converting a room near the 
library into a central plant for the computer center. 
</P>
<P>
 The school will open on Sept. 18. SHELBY GRAD

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAGUNA BEACH; CITY SETTLES SEXUAL HARASSMENT LAWSUIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE EARNEST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A sexual harassment lawsuit against Laguna Beach by a former employee who 
alleged that stress and a hostile work environment forced her from her job was 
settled this week when the City Council approved a $40,000 payment. 
</P>
<P>
 Marion L. Roubanis, who worked for the city's Municipal Services Department 
from June, 1989, to February, 1992, alleged that male co-workers had urged her 
to wear tight clothes, discuss her sex life and look at nude magazine pictures. 
She also claimed that her supervisors failed to help when she complained. 
</P>
<P>
 In a memo to the council, City Manager Kenneth C. Frank said that some 
employees had conducted themselves in a "less than stellar manner on several 
occasions" but that management and supervisory personnel had responded to 
Roubanis' complaints "in a reasonable manner." 
</P>
<P>
 The settlement was negotiated last week at the end of the first day of what 
was expected to be a two-week trial. The suit was filed last year. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the memo, the city's attorney predicted that the city had "a good 
chance" of prevailing. But Frank and the attorney recommended the settlement 
because it was "simply not cost-effective" to proceed with the trial, the memo 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The settlement was unanimously endorsed by the council without discussion on 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 During the time of her employment, Roubanis was the only woman working in the 
Municipal Services Department's mechanical maintenance division, which now has 
a female supervisor. Her job duties included fueling and washing buses and 
inspecting city police cars. 
</P>
<P>
 Roubanis alleged that she was harassed by about six male co-workers, including 
one who put dirty underwear in her locker. Eventually, the suit alleged, 
co-workers stopped speaking to Roubanis and she felt forced to leave the 
"hostile and abusive work environment." 
</P>
<P>
 The city responded to the lawsuit by saying that city employees "took 
immediate and effective action every time (Roubanis) lodged a complaint" and 
that she was offered, but rejected, other employment options with the city. 
</P>
<P>
 A workers' compensation claim filed by Roubanis against the city was settled 
for $10,000 earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Roubanis could not be reached for comment Thursday. LESLIE EARNEST

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ORANGE; EXPERT ON GANGS STRESSES PARENTAL ROLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRIAN RAY BALLOU 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Some of the tactics police use to curb gang activity are actually increasing 
it, a gang expert on Thursday told a group of about 35 Orange County law 
enforcement officials, politicians, educators and community activists. 
</P>
<P>
 Malcolm Klein, the director of social science research at USC, said sweeping 
operations by police that attempt to arrest members of a particular street gang 
and sponsored activity programs for specific gangs are detrimental because they 
reinforce a member's identification with the gang. 
</P>
<P>
 Klein, who was invited to address the group, gave a three-hour lecture on the 
proliferation of gangs. 
</P>
<P>
 He offered a solution to the county's burgeoning gang problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "Orange County was once thought to be immune from gang activity, but that 
sentiment was nothing more than denial," he said. "Gangs are the byproduct of 
the community; we need to work there. Parents have to take the lead role in 
making sure their kids stay out of gangs. 
</P>
<P>
 "The dilemma is that if police focus on a gang as a whole, either through 
rehabilitation or suppression, they are inadvertently building it up. Most 
gangs are very loosely organized, but their numbers increase and members become 
more cohesive once they are sought out." 
</P>
<P>
 Klein said a 2-year-old anti-gang project in Westminster known as TARGET 
(Tri-Agency Resources Gang Enforcement Team) may be an exception if its success 
holds up. 
</P>
<P>
 The project, which is serving as a model for other programs in the county, has 
reduced gang violence 60% over two years by arresting gang leaders, Westminster 
Police Chief James Cook said. 
</P>
<P>
 Law enforcement officials said 15 other gangs have been identified in the 
county this year, bringing the number up to at least 300. BRIAN RAY BALLOU

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA ANA; TEENS ENLISTED AS TUTORS, ROLE MODELS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Seated at a desk next to tutor Luis Reyes, 12-year-old Robert Diaz read a few 
lines from his book "Robert the Rose Horse," then looked up for a quick 
critique. 
</P>
<P>
 "Very good," said Reyes, a 16-year-old sophomore at Santa Ana High School. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert smiled. He said later that hearing such words of encouragement has 
helped him improve his reading as well as his outlook on school work. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel happy for myself. I used to be bad in reading. I used to get D's, but 
now I'm starting to get B's," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert is one of 120 children participating in a program at Martin R. Heninger 
Elementary School designed to boost the reading and writing skills of students 
who are often years behind their classmates academically. 
</P>
<P>
 Called "Helping One Student to Succeed," the program offers individual 
tutoring and a detailed study plan for each of the children, who are third-, 
fourth- and fifth-graders. 
</P>
<P>
 At the beginning of the program, students take a 10-page reading test to 
assess their skill levels. The test results are entered into a computer 
database, which generates a list of specific exercises designed to improve 
their weak areas, said Anita Ford, who coordinates the program. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of their poor reading skills, students in the program often do poorly 
in other subjects as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to read to do math, you have to read to do science, you have to read 
to do everything," Ford said. 
</P>
<P>
 The program has been in use for more than a decade in some areas of the 
country but is new to Orange County. Heninger is one of only three schools 
locally which participate, along with Robert P. Heideman Elementary School in 
the Tustin Unified School District and El Camino Real Elementary School in the 
Irvine Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
 All three began earlier this school year, Heninger Principal Kathy Sabine 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Where the program has been employed elsewhere, students several years behind 
their classmates can usually catch up in one year, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 At Heninger, most of the tutors come from Santa Ana High School across the 
street. Ford said they serve as role models as well as tutors for the children. 
</P>
<P>
 The children "really appreciate that there is a person waiting to help them. I 
have children who didn't like to read, but when they come here, it's the first 
thing they want to do," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 During one recent session, about a dozen pairs of students and tutors 
performed vocabulary crossword puzzles, read aloud and played word games on 
classroom computers.  
</P>
<P>
 After finishing her crossword puzzle, 10-year-old Yolanda Duarte said she 
loved the program. 
</P>
<P>
 "They teach you things that you didn't know," she said. "It's cool, it's 
exciting." JON NALICK

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; PARKING SHORTAGE CONCERNS COUNCIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BILLITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council has put together a rough draft of changes for its downtown 
master plan, but many on the council are still unhappy about a parking 
shortage. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are at least 200 spaces short," Councilman David Sullivan said. "And we're 
not designating additional space for parking; it's just an amorphous situation. 
If we take any more teeth out (of downtown parking regulations), we're left 
with just dentures." 
</P>
<P>
 Sullivan and other council members expressed their concern about downtown 
parking spaces after the council on Wednesday night took a series of straw 
votes on proposed changes to the downtown master plan. The changes approved by 
the straw votes will be incorporated into a city ordinance before the council 
takes a formal vote on the issue in early June. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the proposed changes are technical matters, such as allowable alley 
widths and building-setback requirements. 
</P>
<P>
 But the changes will not take care of the expected higher demand for parking 
downtown, according to Sullivan and several other council members. They worried 
aloud that as more downtown blocks are redeveloped, the parking problem will 
continue to worsen. 
</P>
<P>
 City Administrator Michael T. Uberuaga, however, told the council that 
downtown's parking situation is not as bad as they may think. "Part of the 
problem is not parking supply, but how we manage it," Uberuaga said. 
</P>
<P>
 Uberuaga said that the city-owned downtown parking structure is rarely filled 
to capacity. He said that the structure was filled during the downtown art fair 
last month, the first time it had been full since last summer's Pierfest 
celebration. 
</P>
<P>
 Some downtown property owners nevertheless contend that parking is becoming a 
critical problem. One of them, Bob Mandic, told the council that businesses 
soon will be affected unless the city finds more space for downtown parking. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not just a parking problem," Mandic warned. "It's going to be a 
marketing problem in the future." BILL BILLITER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ANAHEIM; TOPLESS BAR'S LIQUOR LICENSE SUSPENDED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TERRY SPENCER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A bar that went topless last year after winning a controversial court case 
against the city has had its liquor license suspended for 20 days because its 
female dancers exposed their genitals to undercover police officers, officials 
said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Sandraella's license was suspended March 31 and the club will be barred from 
serving alcoholic drinks until April 19, said Dale Rasmussen, district 
administrator for the state Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control.  
</P>
<P>
 State law prohibits female dancers at a bar from exposing more than their 
breasts and buttocks and they must remain at least six feet from the customers, 
Rasmussen said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anaheim Police Department vice officers went undercover and on numerous dates 
saw dancers violating" ABC regulations, he said.  
</P>
<P>
 The city filed the charges with the ABC last July 31 -- less than a month 
after the bar won its court case, which led to the first strip clubs in the 
city in at least 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Randall Garrou, the attorney for the bar's owners, Robert and Sandra Dease, 
disputed the ABC determination Thursday but said it is impossible to defend 
against such charges. 
</P>
<P>
 "If a policeman comes in and says on March 13, 1848, he was in the bar and a 
dancer exposed herself, how can you fight that?" Garrou said. "Nothing had 
happened that day to make it stand out and these officers are undercover so 
they don't announce their presence. We can't dispute it, even though we believe 
it to be untrue. . . . If the officers did see anything, they had to look long, 
hard and sideways to see it." 
</P>
<P>
 The bar went topless last summer after a federal court ruled that the city's 
ordinance was unconstitutionally vague. The ordinance allowed the City Council 
to ban nude dancing at a public establishment if it believed such entertainment 
detrimental to the surrounding neighborhood.  
</P>
<P>
 Since then, the council has passed an ordinance allowing strip clubs, but only 
under specific conditions. For example, the club must be at least 1,000 feet 
from a school, church or park. 
</P>
<P>
 At least two other strip clubs are now operating in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, while its alcoholic beverage license is suspended, Sandraella's is 
offering totally nude dancing, Garrou said. 
</P>
<P>
 "With the license suspended, (nude dancing) is no problem because 
(Sandraella's) is not subject to ABC rules," Garrou said. TERRY SPENCER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ANAHEIM; NIGHTCLUB REOPENS AFTER GETTING PERMIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FERNANDO ROMERO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Prestigio Towers Bar and Grill, where six men were shot and wounded early 
Wednesday, was reopened Thursday after authorities closed it briefly for 
operating without a permit. 
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim Code Enforcement Manager John Poole said the owner of the club, Kent 
Hong, received a one-year, conditional permit in March, 1993, to operate a 
restaurant-bar, but that he instead "operated a nightclub (offering) minimal -- 
if any -- food."  
</P>
<P>
 The conditional permit expired on March 1, he said. On March 26, Poole said, 
he and an inspector visited the club and found that "its entire menu consisted 
of tomato paste and fried chicken wings -- there was no bread, nothing in that 
kitchen." 
</P>
<P>
 Poole said he gave Hong a warning: turn his place into a bona fide restaurant 
or close.  
</P>
<P>
 Hong apparently did not heed the warning and continued operating his place as 
a club catering to teen-agers and people in their early 20s, offering free hors 
d'oeuvres but not much else food, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim Police Lt. Vince Howard said the Prestigio has been having problems 
with a rowdy clientele. On March 17, he said, one customer started shooting at 
the ceiling and was arrested. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, on Wednesday, as the club was about to close at 2 a.m., a gunman outside 
the club sprayed it with 15 to 20 bullets, injuring six men. 
</P>
<P>
 Police are looking into the possibility that the gunman, still at large, may 
have been asked to leave earlier that night because he was bothering a 
waitress. 
</P>
<P>
 Jason Shurtliff, 21, was listed in critical condition Thursday after 
undergoing surgery. He was was hit in the abdomen by a bullet, hospital 
officials said. The other victims, most of whom are disc jockeys or promoters 
for the club's entertainment, were recuperating from lesser injuries at 
hospitals throughout the area. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities closed the bar briefly on Wednesday, but that same day Hong 
reapplied for a restaurant-bar permit and was allowed to open. But if he 
doesn't start operating a restaurant today, Poole said, he "will be subject to 
criminal prosecution." 
</P>
<P>
 Poole said violations of city and state codes are misdemeanor offenses that 
can bring up to $1,000 in fines and/or up to six months in jail. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's Planning Commission will decide whether to grant Hong a permanent 
permit in about 45 days, Poole said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, he said, "in any given day there is a good possibility we 
will inspect the place." FERNANDO ROMERO

 Police using an electronic tracking device arrested two suspects within 15 
minutes after a credit union robbery was committed Thursday as the pair sat in 
a booth at a Whittier restaurant.

 La Habra police received a 911 call at 10:12 a.m. reporting an armed robbery 
in progress at the Southwest Credit Union in the 900 block of East Whittier 
Boulevard. One employee was slightly injured during the robbery but declined 
medical treatment, Sgt. Ron Harryman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Within two minutes, police arrived at the scene and were told by witnesses 
that four or five suspects had driven off, going west on Whittier Boulevard. 
Police said they tracked the getaway car by following the signal emitted by an 
electronic device planted with the stolen money. 
</P>
<P>
 The device led them to the Baker's Square Restaurant in the 16200 block of 
Whittier Boulevard, in the city of Whittier. 
</P>
<P>
 Additional police units from La Habra, Buena Park and Whittier, together with 
a helicopter from the Anaheim Police Department, converged on the restaurant at 
10:26 a.m., Harryman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The suspects, identified as Larry Williams and Carol Viola Waight, both 
20-year-old Los Angeles residents, were sitting at the first booth in the 
restaurant when police arrived, according to Kal Paviolo, the restaurant's 
general manager. 
</P>
<P>
 Police managed to signal from the outside to an employee to usher three other 
customers and five other employees to the back of the restaurant, Paviolo said. 
</P>
<P>
 The suspects "just sat there," she said. "The police came in and took them 
away" without incident. 
</P>
<P>
 Money believed taken in the robbery was found in the vehicle, police said, 
along with four ski masks, several guns and the tracking device. Police are 
still looking for three other suspects believed to have been involved in the 
robbery. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams and Waight are being held on suspicion of bank robbery at La Habra 
Jail on $50,000 bail each.

CATALINA AIR CRASH VICTIM IDENTIFIED AS LAGUNA MAN; ACCIDENT: PILOT OF 
SINGLE-ENGINE PLANE HAD RADIOED THAT HE WAS IN TROUBLE AND WAS TRYING TO REACH 
THE ISLAND'S AIRPORT WHEN HE CRASHED IN A RUGGED CANYON.

<P>
 A Laguna Beach man killed when his single-engine plane crashed in a remote 
area of Santa Catalina Island has been identified as Jeffrey Noel Matson, 
authorities said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Matson, 33, who received his private pilot's license less than nine months 
ago, transmitted a distress signal to air traffic control in El Toro just 
minutes before crashing at 6:45 p.m. Tuesday, according to Jim Miller, a 
spokesman for the Federal Aviation Administration. Matson told the tower he had 
engine trouble and planned to land at Catalina Airport, Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
 But before air control could locate Matson on radar to provide him with 
assistance, the aircraft lost radio contact and crashed into a dry creek bed in 
a canyon near Big Springs, six miles from the airport. 
</P>
<P>
 Matson had rented the single-engine Cessna 152 from Orange County Flight 
Center at John Wayne Airport at 5 p.m. Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 He left on what was to be a two-hour solo trip, said the company's owner, Gary 
Sequeira. 
</P>
<P>
 Matson did not leave an itinerary, Sequeira said. Matson was a frequent 
customer who had been renting planes since last September, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 FAA spokesman Fred O'Donnell in Los Angeles said it would take several months 
for investigators to determine the cause of the crash. Wreckage from the scene 
as well as other clues will be analyzed in Los Angeles and Washington, 
O'Donnell said. 
</P>
<P>
 People who were camping on the western end of Catalina said they saw the 
airplane sputtering and circling above the island before it disappeared behind 
a ridge, said Capt. Larry Hambleton of the Los Angeles County Fire Department 
on Catalina. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then they saw smoke. It looks like the pilot tried to make a forced landing. 
It was in extremely rugged terrain," Hambleton said. 
</P>
<P>
 Several island residents saw thick smoke rising from the canyon where the 
plane crashed, and called the Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
 When rescuers arrived, they encountered a two-acre blaze at the bottom of an 
800-foot-deep canyon that is inaccessible by car. 
</P>
<P>
 After wading through waist-high cacti and thick brush down the steep terrain, 
sheriff's deputies and firemen found the plane's burning fuselage. Matson's 
body was discovered 40 feet away, having apparently been thrown from the plane 
on impact, Hambleton said. 
</P>
<P>
 Russ Butler, Matson's former next-door neighbor in Laguna Beach, said Matson 
was a "warm, considerate person with a good sense of humor." Butler said Matson 
was single and had no immediate family in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 He said Matson was in the real estate business. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very sad and I feel just awful about his death. He was a great person," 
Butler said.

2 SHOT IN GANG CROSS-FIRE, POLICE SAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 6-year-old girl and a 20-year-old man were shot Thursday in what police said 
was gang cross-fire in the 1900 block of West Myrtle Street. 
</P>
<P>
 Just before 6 p.m., an apparent gun battle broke out between rival gangs near 
Myrtle and Wood streets, said Sgt. Jim McDaniel of the Santa Ana gang unit. 
</P>
<P>
 The girl apparently was hit by a stray shot. Both she and the man were taken 
to a local hospital, where they were reported in fair condition Thursday night, 
police said.

GRIFFITH-JOYNER, DRIVER HURT IN HIT-RUN CRASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 U.S. Olympic gold medalist Florence Griffith-Joyner and her driver were 
slightly injured early Thursday when their limousine was rear-ended by an 
alleged hit-and-run driver on Interstate 5, the California Highway Patrol said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1992 Lincoln Town Car limousine in which Griffith-Joyner was a passenger 
was rear-ended by a pickup truck driven by Eloy Adalberto Griego Jr., 49, of 
Albuquerque, N.M., CHP spokesman Bruce Lian said. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Griffith-Joyner, 34 of Mission Viejo and her driver, Eugene Lyles, 50, of 
Los Angeles were slightly injured, Lian said. 
</P>
<P>
 Al Joyner, 34, Joyner's husband and himself an Olympic gold medalist, was also 
in the limousine but was not injured, Lian said. 
</P>
<P>
 The accident occurred about 5 a.m. in the northbound lanes of Interstate 5 
just north of the El Toro Road off-ramp. 
</P>
<P>
 Lian said the hit-and-run driver "must have been flying, because the limousine 
was going between 55 and 60 m.p.h., and (he) blasted them from the rear." 
</P>
<P>
 Griego drove away from the scene before police could get there, Lian said. 
Joyner and Lyles were taken by paramedics to Saddleback Memorial Medical Center 
in Laguna Hills. Both were treated and released by 8 a.m., said hospital 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Both vehicles sustained "moderate damages," Lian said. 
</P>
<P>
 A short time after the accident, Orange County sheriff's deputies received a 
call about a possible prowler on Cavanaugh Road in Lake Forest, Lian said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lian said deputies discovered Griego looking for a place to hide after 
abandoning his truck on the freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 Griego was arrested on suspicion of hit-and-run driving and attempted 
burglary. The latter charge stems from Griego's alleged attempt to break into a 
house on Cavanaugh Road, Lian said. He was being held at County Jail on $10,000 
bail.

EX-MAIL CARRIER COULD FACE DEATH SENTENCE, HIS LAWYER SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RENE LYNCH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A former letter carrier accused of killing his mother and a former co-worker 
during a two-day rampage last year faces a possible death sentence, his 
attorney said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County prosecutors decided to seek the death penalty for Mark Richard 
Hilbun, 40, despite defense concerns about Hilbun's history of mental problems, 
including depression and manic-depressive behavior, said Deputy Public Defender 
Denise Gragg. 
</P>
<P>
 Gragg said the defense will focus on Hilbun's mental state. 
</P>
<P>
 Hilbun faces trial later this year on two counts of murder, seven counts of 
attempted murder, and one count each of robbery, attempted kidnaping, burglary 
and killing his mother's dog, according to an indictment in January by the 
Orange County Grand Jury. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Rick King could not be reached for comment late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Hilbun is accused of killing his mother, Frances, in her Corona del Mar home 
on March 6, 1993. He is charged with shooting two postal workers -- one fatally 
-- as he tried to kidnap Kim Springer, a postal worker with whom he had become 
infatuated and had been stalking, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hilbun had been fired from the Dana Point Post Office in December, 1992, in 
part due to his behavior toward Springer, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The other person killed, Dana Point postal worker Charles T. Barbagallo, 42, 
was said to be Hilbun's best friend. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said Hilbun then went on a rampage, attacking and wounding five 
other people in Dana Point, Newport Beach and Fountain Valley during a two-day 
period in which he managed to evade a countywide manhunt for him. 
</P>
<P>
 He was arrested drinking cocktails and watching television at a Huntington 
Beach sports bar. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorneys have been unsuccessful in their attempts to have Hilbun 
declared mentally incapable of standing trial. Since he has been in custody, 
Hilbun has lost weight and apparently tried to commit suicide in June by 
jumping from a second-story walkway at Orange County Central Men's Jail.

O.C. MAN'S DEATH PROBED IN L.A. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Sheriff's Department is investigating the shooting death this 
week of a Garden Grove man whose body was found west of downtown. 
</P>
<P>
 The body of Willie Williams, 25, was found about 2 a.m. Wednesday next to a 
public telephone and his car in the Windsor Hills district, said Deputy Patrick 
Hauser. 
</P>
<P>
 Hauser said two deputies spotted the body alongside the parked car in the 3900 
block of West Slauson Avenue. Williams had been shot once in the upper torso, 
Hauser said. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities have no motive for the shooting, and there are no suspects. 
Williams had no criminal record, the Sheriff's Department said.

LAGUNA BEACH FIRE VICTIMS APPEAL PROPERTY ASSESSMENTS; REAL ESTATE: 22 
TAXPAYERS CONTEND APPRAISALS ARE TOO HIGH. COUNTY OFFICIALS SAY SOME 
ADJUSTMENTS ARE POSSIBLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A group of Laguna Beach fire victims who contend that the county has appraised 
their vacant properties at too high a price appeared before an independent 
appeals board Thursday to ask that their property values -- and property taxes 
-- be lowered. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, 22 of the 366 property owners whose homes were destroyed in the 
devastating Oct. 27 wildfire are contesting the county's assessments. 
</P>
<P>
 The hearings at the old Orange County Courthouse gave property owners an 
opportunity to present evidence supporting their position to the three-member 
panel appointed by the Orange County Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 The board, which also heard presentations from the county assessor's office, 
will decide at a later time whether to make any adjustments in the assessments, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "In some cases there might be adjustments and in others there might not be," 
said Webster J. Guillory, manager of management services for the assessor's 
office. 
</P>
<P>
 Guillory did not address individual complaints during an interview Thursday 
but said property owners were dealt "with fairly and equally across the board." 
</P>
<P>
 "We have talked to many of these people, and we understand how concerned they 
are," he said. "Of course, out of roughly 400 people, there will be some 
differences of opinions." 
</P>
<P>
 Guillory said that when a vacant parcel is assessed, the land is appraised by 
subtracting the value of the home and other improvements from the entire 
property's value the last time it was sold or improved. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the property owners, frustrated by the lengthy hearing process, left 
before they could present their case. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're fighting big government," said Frank Smart, who lost his home on Canyon 
Acres Drive. "It's clearly obvious that their assessment of the vacant lots are 
not anywhere near reality." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a full-time job when you lose your house," added P.J. Duke, an engineer 
at McDonnell Douglas in Huntington Beach. "We are very, very busy, and this is 
just another time-consuming thing you have to go through. When obstacles come 
up like this, it's very frustrating." 
</P>
<P>
 "You would think that you would get a better break after the fire or more 
reasonable treatment," said Peter Moore, Duke's husband.

MEN ROB MEDICAL OFFICE, INVADE HOME OF 1 VICTIM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Four men armed with semiautomatic handguns and knives robbed a Westminster 
medical office Thursday, then used keys taken from one of the victims to invade 
an apartment in Huntington Beach, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The robbers entered the medical office in the 9000 block of Edinger Avenue 
sometime before 11 a.m., Officer Robin Kapp of the Westminster Police 
Department said. 
</P>
<P>
 Seven people inside the office were robbed of an undetermined amount of cash 
and jewelry, and tied up. Two of the assailants then took a set of keys from 
one of the victims and drove her car to her apartment in Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Huntington Beach police said they believe the two robbers used the keys to 
enter the apartment in a large complex in the 8400 block of Edinger Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 They surprised the victim's 30-year-old husband and threatened him with a 
kitchen knife that one of them was carrying, Lt. Luis Ochoa of the Huntington 
Beach Police Department said. They put a towel over his head, tied him up, and 
ransacked the apartment of an undetermined amount of cash and jewelry, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 They then phoned the doctor's office in Westminster and informed the two other 
assailants that they were finished, Ochoa said. The men at both locations left. 
</P>
<P>
 The victim at the apartment and the victims at the doctor's office managed to 
free themselves and called police. No one was injured in either incident, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The robbers were described as being in their mid-20s, wearing baggy clothing 
and bandannas. Police said they were still searching for the stolen car.

LOCAL ELECTIONS / TUSTIN CITY COUNCIL; COUNCIL CHALLENGERS SEE THE CITY AT 
CROSSROADS; POLITICS: INCUMBENTS WHO SAY SUCCESSES ARE EVIDENT WILL FACE 
POLITICAL NEWCOMERS WHO ARE PUSHING FOR CHANGE IN DIRECTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Voters go to the polls Tuesday in a City Council election that could alter the 
direction the city takes in the next four years. 
</P>
<P>
 The incumbents who hold the two seats to be decided insist the city is in good 
hands: Crime is down, sales taxes are up, new jobs are coming in and, while 
nearby cities struggle, Tustin has remained financially healthy. 
</P>
<P>
 But opponents say much has to change. Council members should not accept gifts 
from anyone, they should not serve more than two terms, and they should not 
accept contributions over $99 from any individual. 
</P>
<P>
 Incumbents Leslie Anne Pontious and Charles E. Puckett face political 
newcomers Michael J. Doyle and Tracy Worley. The top two vote-getters in the 
citywide race will win. 
</P>
<P>
 Lurking in the not-too-distant future is the redevelopment of the Tustin 
Marine Corps Air Station, the single most critical planning issue council 
members will face as early as this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 When the base closes in 1997, Tustin stands to inherit more than 2,000 acres 
of land and buildings, plus the headaches and opportunities of turning the base 
into an economic asset of the city. 
</P>
<P>
 That's why people with planning experience are needed on the council, say 
Pontious and Puckett, who have both served on the Planning Commission and on 
the 17-member panel drafting a reuse plan for the base. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look at what East Tustin has done to the city," said Pontious of the business 
district, which has been credited increasing Tustin's sales taxes this year by 
16%. "We're talking of a much larger space (at the base). What happens there is 
critical to the future of the city." 
</P>
<P>
 Puckett said that "because of good planning, we were able to generate sales 
taxes and kept the city strong. We have not raised taxes, laid off employees or 
cut services."  
</P>
<P>
 But Doyle, a businessman who is running for public office for the first time, 
said that redevelopment of the Tustin Marine base is "maybe 15 to 17 years 
away." 
</P>
<P>
 "The immediate concern -- drafting a reuse plan -- has been addressed," Doyle 
said. "The plan is good. But when was the last time the federal government got 
anything done in time?" 
</P>
<P>
 The conversion plan being drafted by the reuse panel will be submitted to the 
Department of the Navy, which owns the base. The approval process could take 
beyond 1997, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, Worley said, city officials should look at blighted areas, 
such as the city's southwest, where incidents of gang violence and graffiti are 
common. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we turn our backs on this declining area, it will continue to spread and 
our property values will suffer," Worley said. 
</P>
<P>
 She said that there will be "ideological changes" in the City Council if she 
and Doyle are elected. She would push for limits on campaign contributions, ban 
gifts to council members and limit council members to two terms, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Politics, as it has been practiced, is no longer acceptable," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 In response to the challengers' call for term limits, Puckett and Pontious 
have both promised not to seek a third term. They said members of the city's 
committees and commissions should serve no more than six years. But state law 
already limits campaign contributions, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 And incumbents said that while the challengers promised not to accept 
contributions of more than $99 per contributor, the Tustin police union spent 
nearly $6,000 for a mailer sent in February supporting the challengers. 
</P>
<P>
 A Pontious supporter has filed a complaint with the Fair Political Practices 
Commission against Doyle, Worley and the police union. The complaint alleges 
that the $6,000 spent on the mailer should have been reported as a campaign 
contribution. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials of the police union have said that because the mailer was published 
without Doyle or Worley's consent or knowledge, it was simply a union expense 
and therefore need not be reported as a contribution. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the police union, Doyle and Worley have been endorsed by the 
city employees union and Mayor Jim Potts. 
</P>
<P>
 But Potts' endorsement has drawn charges from supporters of Puckett and 
Pontious that the mayor is trying to create a voting bloc in the council. He 
has denied that, saying that Doyle and Worley "can think for themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 Chief Deputy City Clerk Valerie Whiteman said the city has more than 22,000 
registered voters. For the past two elections, turnout has been about 20%, he 
said. Tustin Council Candidates

POLICE ARREST DRIVER AFTER 3-CITY CHASE; CRIME: STOLEN CAR IS STOPPED AFTER 
TIRES ARE PUNCTURED. CAR MAY BE LINKED TO ROBBERIES.

<P>
 A transient who led police on a chase through three Orange County cities was 
arrested after officers plastered a road with spikes to puncture his tires, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The pursuit, which started just after midnight Thursday in Santa Ana, ended 
nearly 50 minutes later on a Huntington Beach street when the spikes worked, 
said Santa Ana police Lt. Robert Helton. 
</P>
<P>
 Arrested was Manuel Garcia Jr., 27, formerly of Fountain Valley but with no 
current address. 
</P>
<P>
 A female passenger was questioned and released. Garcia, who is on parole for 
burglary, is being held on suspicion of possession of a stolen car and evading 
arrest, Helton said. 
</P>
<P>
 Two Santa Ana police officers, who were slightly injured when their cruisers 
crashed during the chase, were treated at a local hospital, Helton said. Both 
patrol cars were heavily damaged. 
</P>
<P>
 The chase began at 12:32 a.m. in the 100 block of West Borchard Avenue when an 
officer did a computer check of a Ford Tempo that matched the description of a 
car used in recent robberies. The check revealed that the license plates on the 
car had been reported stolen March 8 in Costa Mesa, while the car itself had 
been stolen in Santa Ana, the lieutenant said. 
</P>
<P>
 The driver failed to stop, triggering a chase through Santa Ana, Fountain 
Valley and into Huntington Beach at speeds up to 50 m.p.h., he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Both of the car's front tires blew out at Springdale Street and Edinger Avenue 
after it ran over the spikes. Garcia drove the car several more blocks, 
stopping at Springdale Street and Warner Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Police, anticipating that the driver would head there, had stopped traffic in 
the immediate area before laying down the spikes to stop the car. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators have yet to determine whether Garcia is linked to the robberies 
in which the Tempo was used. He will be arraigned today and then moved from 
City Jail to County Jail.

HIGH SCHOOL NOTEBOOK: SIMI VALLEY KEEPING GRIP ON ITS GAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Why is Simi Valley, with only three returning starters, winning as often as it 
did last year? 
</P>
<P>
 Defense. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pioneers committed only seven errors through their first 10 games, nine of 
them victories. Last year's team, which finished 27-4 and was ranked No. 1 in 
the nation for most of the season, made 22 errors in its first 10 games. 
</P>
<P>
 The strength of the defense has been an infield of third baseman Ryan Hankins, 
shortstop Dan Schwartz, second baseman Tim Nykoluk and first basemen Bill 
Scheffels and Brian Kavanagh, who plays first when Scheffels pitches. 
</P>
<P>
 "The pitching and the defense is what is winning ballgames for us," Coach Mike 
Scyphers said. "I just think they are kind of a roll right now and making every 
play." 
</P>
<P>
 The pitching Scyphers referred to is courtesy of Scheffels (5-0, 2.65 
earned-run average) and right-hander Kary Kozlowski (4-0, 1.27). MARMONTE 
LEAGUE 
</P>
<P>
 Kaup Shows Stuff 
</P>
<P>
 Camarillo baseball Coach Jack Willard has found one positive in the team's 0-4 
league start: pitcher Nathan Kaup. 
</P>
<P>
 Kaup was the Scorpions' second baseman, but as Camarillo continued to lose, 
Willard started to experiment. So he brought in Kaup to pitch. In two outings, 
Kaup has given up two earned runs in nine innings. 
</P>
<P>
 "His arm is decent and we figured we'd give him a shot just to see someone 
different," Willard said. "We've put him in some important situations and he's 
kept us in games. For the limited time he's been on the mound, he's pretty 
poised and handles situations well." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Agoura Coach Bryan Maloney finally has his team's defense figured out. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every day that we've taken a bad infield (practice), we play well," Maloney 
said, "and when we take infield pretty solidly, we make mistakes during the 
game. Maybe we should get all the mistakes out of the way during infield." 
GOLDEN LEAGUE 
</P>
<P>
 Speed Thrills 
</P>
<P>
 Life in the fast lane: Palmdale has 67 stolen bases in 12 games. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's already off to a good start," Coach Kent Bothwell said. 
</P>
<P>
 That's not a good start, that's a good season.  
</P>
<P>
 The Falcons have six players with seven or more thefts, including shortstop 
Jerome Payton, who has stolen 19 bases in 20 attempts. 
</P>
<P>
 Rounding out the list are Bob Harmon (12), Charo Boyer (10) and Dan Soto, 
Chris Gravois and Tim Guzman (seven each). 
</P>
<P>
 "That's kind of been our style," Bothwell said. "It really puts pressure on 
opposing teams." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Add Palmdale: Harmon's versatility has been a key for the Falcons' winning 
nine of 12 games. The senior is the team's leading hitter (.467), second in 
doubles (3), triples (2) and runs batted in (11) and the left-handed pitcher is 
2-1 with a 2.55 earned-run average. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's doing a little bit of everything for us," Bothwell said. "He's really 
come on and played some great baseball." 
</P>
<P>

 Perhaps the descent was inevitable. Antelope Valley center fielder Chris Tapia 
was so hot at the start of the season, it's a wonder he didn't set off smoke 
alarms. 
</P>
<P>
 In a game against Littlerock two weeks ago, Tapia went five for five with two 
doubles, two triples and a home run, scoring five runs and driving in eight. 
His batting average stood at .632. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's quite a game, huh?" Antelope Coach Ed t'Sas said. "There's only one 
way to go from there." 
</P>
<P>
 Hint: It isn't up. 
</P>
<P>
 Since that game, Tapia has gone three for 20 and his average has dropped to 
.384. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're just trying to keep him on an even keel," t'Sas said. "He'll be fine. 
He's a wonderful all-around player -- as a baserunner and a defensive player -- 
and I think he's a joy to coach." 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 Highland's close shaves keep ending with a painful nick. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bulldogs (2-10) have lost seven games by one run. In all seven they have 
led in the fourth inning or later. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's kind of a good news/bad news thing," Coach Mike Van Cheri said. "The 
good news is, you know you're right there. The bad news is we lose. I guess 
we're the best 2-10 team you'll see."

 Jamaal Chase of Quartz Hill has been moved into a tie for seventh on the 
all-time region list in the boys' long jump after the results from the Beverly 
Hills Invitational on Mar. 26 were revised. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rebel senior was initially credited with a second-place mark of 23-10 1/2 
behind the winning 23-11 of Pomona's Lurea Frazier. But when the result cards 
were reviewed, both athletes were credited with marks of 23-11, with Chase 
winning the competition because his second-best jump was farther than 
Frazier's. 
</P>
<P>
 If Chase adds another inch to his long jump best, he will become the second 
athlete from the region to have recorded at least 24 feet in the long jump and 
49 feet in the triple jump. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Jones, a 1981 graduate of Kennedy High, spanned 24-6 1/2 in the long jump 
and 49-0 in the triple jump for the Golden Cougars. 
</P>
<P>
 Chase recorded a personal best of 49-3 in the triple jump in the Sunkist 
Invitational in February. NORTHWEST VALLEY

</P>
<P>
 If it was ever truly a slump, it is over now. 
</P>
<P>
 Chatsworth shortstop Bryan LaCour's bat -- so hot last season when he hit .448 
and led the Chancellors to the City Section's 4-A championship game, but so 
cool for much of this young season -- is officially on fire again. 
</P>
<P>
 In the team's four games in the Las Vegas Bishop Gorman tournament last 
weekend, LaCour went nine for 13 (.692) with two doubles, two triples, a home 
run and 14 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
 The weekend streak raised his batting average 114 points to .474. He hovered 
around the .200-.300 mark for much of the early season. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe every team should have a set. 
</P>
<P>
 At Chatsworth, identical twins Rod and Ray Daryabigi have combined to hit .493 
(35 for 71). 
</P>
<P>
 At Taft, twins Nick and Mike Andrisano are hitting a combined .363 (16 for 
44).

 With a 4-3 victory over Chatsworth, the Granada Hills boys' tennis team took 
over the spotlight in City tennis Monday. Chatsworth was the defending 4-A 
champion. Are the Highlanders the new City power? Their record is 7-1. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're in the best league in the City," Coach Ron Wood said. "This is the best 
team we've played to date. It was a big, emotional win." 
</P>
<P>
 Granada Hills (4-0 in conference play) swept the doubles. The No. 2 team of 
James White and Kevin Kim improved to 10-0, while No. 3 Eric Yean and Thomas Ma 
moved to 7-0. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Highlanders won only one of four singles matches -- the last match 
played. Justin Graham outlasted Jeff Heidner, 6-1, 7-6 (7-4) at No. 4 singles. 
</P>

 "It's a lot of pressure on the kids," Wood said. "But that's how American 
heroes are made." FRONTIER LEAGUE

 Moorpark has raced to a 10-1 record (5-0 in league play) with what Coach David 
Rhoades called decent pitching, good hitting and outstanding defense. Brian 
Garrettson carries a .451 batting average and leads six Musketeers with 
averages of .300 or higher. He also has five doubles, 13 RBIs and a 3-0 
pitching record with 27 strikeouts in 20 innings. 
</P>
<P>
 Center fielder Jason Adamson is batting .416 with seven stolen bases and has 
scouts watching him. Shortstop Rick Collier is batting .387 with eight stolen 
bases. 
</P>
<P>
 All is well in Musketeerland, but Rhoades warns, "Nobody remembers how you 
start. It's how you finish. And that's been sticking with me."

 Oak Park's 1993 season was ruined by injuries. So how does Coach Mike Bolyog 
react when he learns his stolen-base leader has torn ligaments and three of his 
pitchers have gone down with shoulder problems in the midst of a 7-1-1 season? 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a bit of a scare," Bolyog said. "But the good news is (the three 
pitchers) will probably come back healthy in a week or so. We have more depth 
and different kinds of injuries." 
</P>
<P>
 Bolyog is not ready to panic despite the following: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Pitcher/first baseman Todd Christensen (.500 batting average) hasn't been 
able to swing a bat because of a torn muscle in his non-pitching shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Pitcher Brent Schneider has been limited to three innings because of 
tendinitis in his pitching shoulder. Schneider, 6-2, 210 pounds, has a .368 
average and nine RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Pitcher Camron Marcarelli (2-1, 1.79 ERA) has been kept off the mound the 
past five games with an irritated muscle in his shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
 But this one hurts. Tyler Blondi, who has stolen 16 bases in 18 attempts, will 
have surgery to repair ligaments in his non-throwing shoulder. Bolyog said 
Blondi probably will be lost for the season. 
</P>

 The St. Francis baseball team recorded a significant victory over the weekend. 
The Knights (6-4) upset Bishop O'Dowd of Oakland, the state's sixth-ranked 
team, 9-2, in the Glendale tournament. "It's the first time all year we've 
pitched, hit and played defense well," St. Francis Coach Tim O'Neil said. 
</P>
<P>
 Three St. Francis pitchers (senior Sean Martin, sophomore Paul Diaz and junior 
Mike Henderson) gave up a total of 12 hits. Diaz leads the team with a 1.20 
ERA. In 19 2/3 innings, he has 18 strikeouts. Around the Leagues . . .

 * Thousand Oaks right-hander Tim Baron has completed all five of the games in 
which he has appeared. Baron is 4-1 with an 0.97 earned-run average.

 * Camarillo outfielder Robert Smith will probably miss the rest of the season 
with torn cartilage in his left ankle, Coach Jack Willard said. In the first 
seven games of the season, Smith was hitting .318 with nine RBIs and nine 
stolen bases.

left wrist during a collision at home plate against Pasadena last week and 
might be lost for the season. Kirk Hagge, the Falcons' regular shortstop, will

A LINK WITH THE PAST; * 'WHO NOW REMEMBERS?' AT GLENDALE COLLEGE IS A 
PSYCHOLOGICAL DRAMA BASED ON THE ARMENIAN MASSACRE OF 1915. PLAYWRIGHT RIDEAUX 
BALDWIN SAYS IT HAS UNIVERSAL APPEAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN ARMINE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Susan Armine is a Glendale writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In 1921 Berlin, a young Armenian man named Soghomon Tehlirian was on trial for 
murder. The man he gunned down in cold blood -- Talaat Pasha (the pasha in the 
name indicates a high official in Turkey) -- was responsible for the deaths of 
Tehlirian's family members. In fact, six years earlier, Talaat had given orders 
for the extermination of 1.5 million Armenians. 
</P>
<P>
 Is murder ever justified, even in such circumstances? Did Tehlirian deserve to 
become a hero of the Armenian people, or even to be acquitted by the German 
court? 
</P>
<P>
 These are the central questions examined in "Who Now Remembers?" -- a new play 
by Rideaux Baldwin -- being presented by the Glendale Community College theater 
arts department. 
</P>
<P>
 While not a conventional courtroom drama, it documents Tehlirian's involvement 
in the Armenian resistance movement that developed after the World War I-era 
massacre. 
</P>
<P>
 The play, based largely on fact, explores Tehlirian's relationship with 
Yeranouhi Danielian, a young woman often called "the Armenian Joan of Arc," who 
worked in the same movement. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who Now Remembers?" is a psychological drama, vividly portraying the spirits 
of the dead, who Tehlirian maintained haunted him and drove him to assassinate 
Talaat. 
</P>
<P>
 The title of the play comes from a speech given by Adolph Hitler to his 
commanding generals in August, 1939: 
</P>
<P>
 "I have placed my death-head formations in readiness . . . with orders to them 
to send to death mercilessly and without compassion men, women and children of 
Polish derivation and language. Only thus shall we gain the living space which 
we need. Who, after all, speaks today of the annihilation of the Armenians?"  
</P>
<P>
 "Who Now Remembers?" emphasizes this historical link by providing Tehlirian 
with a fictitious German roommate. Gerek, a sympathetic character, is later 
passively drawn into becoming part of Hitler's Final Solution, to his own 
horror. 
</P>
<P>
 The project, which is part of Glendale College's regular theater season, has 
already caused a stir in Glendale, a city with a population that is nearly 
one-fourth Armenian. Many residents in the area are the children and 
grandchildren of the survivors of the Armenian genocide. Anger and grief over 
the political killings have been an integral part of the Armenian American 
consciousness for nearly 80 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will never know the numbers who died," said Richard Hovannisian, professor 
of Armenian and Near Eastern history at UCLA and a leading expert in the field. 
"The fact is that the whole nation was destroyed. A way of life and the 
presence of people on the land were totally eliminated." 
</P>
<P>
 The play is also controversial because many people have asserted that the 
atrocities are a fabrication or, at very least, a sizable exaggeration. Ken 
Gray, Glendale professor of theater who is directing the play, says he has 
already received an anonymous phone call from a person insisting that the 
genocide has never been proved. Survivors -- a few still living -- have always 
disagreed, as have Armenian scholars. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were American missionaries and American consular officials in the field 
who witnessed what occurred," Hovannisian said. "Germany and Austria were 
Turkey's allies, and their archives are also filled with documents attesting to 
the organized nature of the destruction of the Armenian people." 
</P>
<P>
 Far from being a didactic or one-sided history lesson, "Who Now Remembers?" 
focuses on the theme of prejudice.  
</P>
<P>
 It is a subject that playwright Baldwin, who is African American, has explored 
in his earlier plays (notably the AIDS-themed "HIVers," which was Glendale 
College's 1992 entry at the American College Theater Festival's regional 
finals). At least one Armenian character in the current play claims to hate 
every Turkish person, and one of the more noble-spirited characters is a Turk. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think everybody in Turkey was behind it," said Gray, referring to the 
1915 genocide. "I think a lot of people in Turkey didn't know about it. That 
doesn't make any difference in this particular production. This production 
looks at one man's need to avenge his mother's death, whether or not that's 
justifiable." 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't want it to be an Armenian play," Gray added. "I really object to 
some theaters that preach to the converted. I wanted other people to know about 
their friends and neighbors that they live and work with." 
</P>
<P>
 To a degree, Gray's student ensemble is already fulfilling that mission. 
</P>
<P>
 The Armenian students who form a third of the cast have had the responsibility 
of coaching their fellow actors in the pronunciation of the Armenian names and 
terms that dot the script. 
</P>
<P>
 They have also found themselves in the position of casual technical advisers, 
offering suggestions on costume and culture, and monitoring an especially 
tricky scene in which the Armenian national anthem is sung in a cafe. 
</P>
<P>
 Largely by coincidence, "Who Now Remembers?" will end its run April 24. This 
is the date on which the Armenian genocide began in 1915, and it is observed as 
a memorial day by Armenians throughout the world. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think audiences across the board will enjoy it because it's so universal," 
Baldwin said of his play. "I try to bring in elements that we all can 
understand. There's love and there's hate and there's loss, and we all 
experience those, no matter what culture. The names are just different." WHERE
