TV REVIEWS; HBO'S 'ARTHUR ASHE' JITTERY BUT LOVING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT KOEHLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Like a lovingly assembled scrap album of photos and memento mori, HBO's 
"Arthur Ashe: Citizen of the World" declares an affection for one of tennis' 
stars that is so righteous yet so sentimental, you have to pinch yourself to 
recall the Arthur Ashe of memory and legend -- the genius of the grass court. 
</P>
<P>
 His profoundly developed mastery of the game, his modern playing style that 
made him the Wilt Chamberlain of tennis and his courtier-like manner were all 
captured on television. This film, written by the fine sports mind and longtime 
Ashe friend, Frank Deford, tries to capture what television often missed. 
</P>
<P>
 It manages this only sporadically, so it's good to know that Deford has hopes 
for a longer film or print biography of Ashe. Here, you sense a frantic urge to 
cram a rich life into the tight space of an hour. How, for instance, do you 
travel the course of an athletic career that saw the breakdown of racial 
barriers in the most segregated sport? How to parallel Ashe's rise from UCLA 
stardom to the game's pinnacle, the Grand Slam, with his rise as a social 
symbol and spokesman? How to convey the tragedy of his death by HIV-tainted 
blood, received during a heart operation? 
</P>
<P>
 All of this is a tad jittery here, but the film's beating heart is Ashe's 
visits to Africa, especially a controversial tour of South Africa in 1971 that 
had racists and anti-apartheid activists equally up in arms. Deford accompanied 
Ashe with a home movie camera, and the footage of young black South Africans 
craning for a look at Ashe through chain-link fences resembling prison bars 
speaks to the power of one man against an evil system. 
</P>
<P>
 Ashe's life refutes the Phoenix Suns' Charles Barkley, who said that athletes 
shouldn't be role models: They can, and be heroes as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "Arthur Ashe" surely pours on this sentiment too thickly, along with the 
nonstop drippy music. But as a thinking man and humanitarian on and off the 
court, Ashe remains a glorious antidote to sports' legion of jerks. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Arthur Ashe: Citizen of the World" airs at 10 tonight on HBO. ROBERT

TV REVIEWS; MTV'S 'SMART SEX' INFORMS, ENTERTAINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WILLMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Announces Christian Slater at the top of tonight's MTV special, "This is a 
story from the front line -- the line that we're all on -- so listen up." Yep, 
it's just us and Slater, slugging it out side by side in the sexual trenches, 
as the channel's look at "Smart Sex" unveils. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who don't quite cotton to the concept of Slater as fellow soldier or, 
worse, safe-sex preacher may be pleased to know that the actor pretty 
effectively disappears for the following hour. What ensues is an unnarrated 
(but none the worse for it) cross-section of American young adults' attitudes 
toward sexuality and disease control, smart or not nearly so. 
</P>
<P>
 It's probably safe to presume that MTV found most of these post-adolescents by 
going through the "Real World" reject applications, but don't hold that against 
them: The sample is wider as well as more representative than you might expect. 
</P>
<P>
 There's the take-control Latina who marches down to the local pharmacist and 
announces, "Quiero latex"; the literal Okie from Muskogee who contracted HIV 
during his furtive cruising visits to the park; the African American girl who 
leads pro-abstinence rallies; the wholesome Tallahassee college couple who've 
put off having sex for months, but are just about ready; a Queens single mom 
who contracted AIDS through heterosexual contact; and, of course, several more 
of the sexually active target demo who do practice what passes for safety. 
</P>
<P>
 Entertaining and not too heavy-handed, "Smart Sex" has the good sense to offer 
a moral shopper's list of more upbeat stories amid the cautionary tales, though 
its most inevitable purpose is as a "Scared Straight" for kids who haven't yet 
figured out that STD isn't an acronym for Stone Temple Pilots. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Smart Sex" airs at 10 tonight on MTV.

 BRANDO: It happened to Marlon Brando, according to his new autobiography. . . 
. Brando was doing research for "The Men," a 1950 film about disabled war 
veterans. So he admitted himself to the old Birmingham Veterans Hospital in Van 
Nuys -- now the site of Birmingham High. One evening, Brando, who had confined 
himself to a wheelchair, joined some disabled vets for dinner at an Italian 
restaurant on Ventura Boulevard. But they were confronted by a woman who took 
pity on them, reassuring them that God would save them. "I know you boys will 
be able to walk someday," she insisted. 
</P>
<P>
 MORE BRANDO: This irritated the vets, who were only looking for a night out on 
the town. "They were really getting sick of her," Brando writes, so in a stunt 
that cracked them up, he suddenly told the woman he did believe. "I got up and 
started tap dancing, then ran around the restaurant and sprinted out the door 
shouting, 'Hallelujah!' " 
</P>
<P>
 QUAKE RIPPLES: These are good times for Valley contractors and laborers, such 
as Kristen Van Derck (above), repairing a Granada Hills home. Quake victims can 
finally pay for repairs. But the high demand causes homeowners to wait weeks or 
months to get work done. . . . Quake damage has also disrupted escrows and 
loans. See Valley Business, pages 10, 12. 
</P>
<P>
 HERE'S STEVE: Most people associate "The Tonight Show" with Johnny Carson or 
Jay Leno. But Encino's Steve Allen actually hosted the first telecast, 40 years 
ago today. Allen, 72, will be Leno's guest tonight. . . . Allen has no regrets 
over leaving the show in 1957. He did a comedy show on prime time, and, he said 
in an interview Monday, hasn't "been out of work since." 
</P>
<P>
 CHINESE GUESTS: The first day in a new school can be pretty scary. But what if 
home is in China? That was the task Monday for 75 sixth-graders visiting Hale 
Middle School in Woodland Hills (B1). . . . They have adjusted well, though one 
child tried to stuff a $50 bill into a Coke machine over the weekend. Michael 
Arkush

 SPECIAL DELIVERY: Still waiting for your tax refund? The check could be in the 
mail. . . . Internal Revenue Service officials say they have been unable to 
repay more than $250,000 to hundreds of Ventura County taxpayers (A3). . . . 
IRS officials say 432 county residents were mailed refunds of between $1.34 and 
$5,038, but that they were returned as undeliverable as addressed. . . . In 
Southern California, the IRS says it is trying to return more than $11 million 
to about 17,000 taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
 SPEAKING OUT: It's Banned Books Week, and several Ventura County bookstores 
are celebrating the freedom to read. . . . For a $1 donation, the Ventura 
Bookstore is handing out "I Read Banned Books" buttons and bumper stickers. And 
Barnes & Noble in Ventura is sponsoring a "Read In" tonight at 6. . . . "I'm 
going to read a little bit of 'Huckleberry Finn,' " said John McDougal, 
assistant manager at Barnes & Noble. Among books banned over the years: the 
Bible, "The Grapes of Wrath" and "Where's Waldo?" 
</P>
<P>
 SECOND CHANCE: When Pete Roina landed at Gateway Community School in 1991, he 
was in trouble and running out of chances. . . . But with the help of the 
Camarillo continuation high school, the 16-year-old Santa Paula youngster is 
now the newest member of the Ventura County Board of Education (B1). . . . 
"It's a second chance for the kids," said Assistant Principal Jeanne Dukes of 
Gateway. "It's a place where they can start over with no reputation and no 
history." 
</P>
<P>
 GUIDING LIGHT: How tough are Fillmore's light poles? Not even the Northridge 
earthquake could knock them down. . . . While the quake fractured Fillmore's 
downtown district, the city's light poles came through unscathed (Valley 
Business, Page 11). . . . John Reynolds, vice president of Ameron Pole Products 
& Systems, said the poles are reinforced with steel wires. "A lot of 
old-fashioned poles crumbled, but it's hard to get public officials to 
acknowledge that it's time for a change," Reynolds said.

PROPERTY VALUES: CLOSING ESCROW IN HOME SALES IS BECOMING MORE ELUSIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Ron Galperin 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A growing percentage of residential sales transactions are failing to close 
escrow, local real estate agents, lenders and escrow officers say. 
</P>
<P>
 Homes are falling out of escrow more frequently, they say, because of buyers 
who can't get loans, or home inspections that reveal expensive 
earthquake-related defects, or the phenomenon of so-called short sales where 
sellers try -- but often fail -- to get a lender's OK on a sale for less than 
the balance of the seller's mortgage. 
</P>
<P>
 Both sides to a real estate transaction must sign a cancellation instruction 
to cancel escrow. If one party can't or won't follow through on the deal, 
though, the deal falls out of escrow -- although escrow officially stays open 
until both parties agree on how to close the escrow account. It's serious 
business, and ought to be avoided if at all possible. 
</P>
<P>
 Ken Carver, owner of Carver Escrow Co. in North Hollywood, said that about 25% 
of the escrows he opens for buyers and sellers fail to close. "This has become 
pretty standard in our industry," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Most deals fall out of escrow because people do not qualify for a loan, or 
because the property is appraised by a lender for less than the sale price. But 
there are other factors boosting the number of deals that go bust, Carver said. 
Lenders always require fire insurance and now increasingly require earthquake 
insurance, he noted, but the January earthquake has made many insurance 
companies reluctant to write new fire and earthquake policies. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have lost some deals because of not being able to get insurance for the 
buyer," Carver said. "All we need is an insurance policy and sometimes there's 
nobody to write it." 
</P>
<P>
 Some sales are never finalized because of relatively minor disputes between 
the buyer and seller, Carver added. After the earthquake, for example, he 
observed many buyers and sellers already in escrow arguing over who should pay 
$500 to replace a block wall. "A lot of deals blow because the parties haven't 
discussed all the issues properly and they haven't met in person," he said. 
"It's easier to compromise when you meet eye-to-eye." 
</P>
<P>
 Jerry Bolin, branch sales manager for Coldwell Banker Residential Brokerage in 
Woodland Hills, said that about 15% to 18% of escrows that his agents open 
never close. One of the main factors driving cancellations is that many 
property owners in the San Fernando Valley are "upside down" on their homes -- 
meaning they owe more than the property is worth -- and a sale depends on 
approval by the lender. About half of buyers and sellers enter escrow before 
the seller's bank has approved the deal, Bolin said. When lenders say no to a 
short pay-off, escrow doesn't close. 
</P>
<P>
 Buyers who make an offer on a home where the seller wants a short pay-off 
should demand that their earnest money check -- a deposit used to open an 
escrow account -- not be cashed until the seller's lender consents to the deal. 
"I wouldn't want my check in escrow until the seller has received a letter from 
the lender that the seller's shortfall has been approved," Bolin said. Buyers 
can ask that their checks be held and that escrow not open until the lender 
approves the short pay-off, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the earthquake, a growing number of homes have been falling out of 
escrow because of property defects and damage discovered when buyers thoroughly 
inspect the homes, said Joe Conrad, president of The Spectrum Group, a mortgage 
brokerage in Woodland Hills. "The large majority of buyers get out of the deal 
because they have a legitimate reason," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 What is considered a legitimate reason for getting out of a contract to buy a 
home depends on the wording of the contract, Conrad said. Almost every contract 
says that the deal is contingent on a number of factors -- most notably a 
satisfactory inspection by the buyer and the buyer's obtaining financing. If 
the inspection turns up serious problems or if the buyer can't get a loan, 
there isn't a breach of contract and the buyer usually gets back the money he 
placed in escrow. 
</P>
<P>
 The cost to the buyer of falling out of escrow in this type of situation is 
usually several hundred dollars in appraisal and inspection fees, and sometimes 
a cancellation fee charged by an escrow company. 
</P>
<P>
 If the buyer backs out of the deal without a good reason, the consequences are 
more serious. That buyer stands to lose his earnest money -- which can be up to 
5% of the purchase price of the home. The buyer and seller may also end up 
suing each other -- and sometimes even the agents join in, demanding their 
commissions. 
</P>
<P>
 Buyers who cancel a sale may lose money, but that's of little comfort to 
sellers who see their sales fall through at the last minute, said Century 21 
Alosta Inc. agent Marty Rodriguez in Glendora. Sellers should protect 
themselves by seeing that the buyer can really deliver on his promises when it 
comes time to close on the sale of a home. 
</P>
<P>
 Sellers and their agents should encourage would-be buyers to use a lender or 
mortgage broker that the seller's agent is familiar with, said Rodriguez. This 
can help sellers be a little more sure that they are getting a credible 
assessment about the ability of a buyer to buy the home. If the buyer already 
has a lender or mortgage broker, the seller may want to encourage the buyer to 
make double loan applications -- one with a money source familiar to the buyer 
and another with a source suggested by the seller. In real estate industry 
lingo, this is known as making "double aps." 
</P>
<P>
 There are other safeguards, Rodriguez said. Sellers should demand a credit 
report with an offer to buy. While a credit report won't reveal all the details 
of a would-be buyer's ability to get a loan, it's a good start. Another way to 
avoid falling out of escrow is for the buyer to be pre-qualified or 
pre-approved by a reputable lender. A letter of pre-qualification won't 
obligate a lender to make a loan, but such letters at least help show the 
seller that the buyer is serious. Pre-approval of a loan is one step better. 
Sellers can also ask for verification of employment or a copy of the buyer's 
banking or other statements that show there is enough money for the down 
payment.

 What trial? During an ESPN report on the Raiders-Chargers football game, the

 Rip Van Winkle, updated: Editorial cartoonist Walt Handlesman of the 
Times-Picayune in New Orleans drew a strip about a pedestrian named Larry who 
was knocked unconscious earlier this year when a construction worker 
accidentally dropped a dill pickle on his head from 22 stories above. Larry 
drifted in and out of sleep for months. "And, then one day," the strip 
continued, "Larry suddenly awoke. . . . And spoke his first words in six 
months: 'Have I missed anything?' "

 The final frame revealed: "And with that, the first juror in the O.J. trial

 You can't do that: Writer Nat Read, the guru of Glendale, last shared with us 
his survey of the cities of the world with that celebrated name (42). Now he's 
back with a list of the activities that are regulated in Glendale, in case 
you're ever in the neighborhood: 
</P>
<P>
 -- You can't take your cat for a walk along a public sidewalk (Ord. 21, 4011). 
</P>
<P>
 -- You can't hitch your horse to a tree (Ord. 21). 
</P>
<P>
 -- You can't sell Indian corn, cornstalks or other Halloween or Thanksgiving 
paraphernalia on or before Oct. 14. (Ord. 4783). 
</P>
<P>
 -- You can't keep two or more pigeons within 150 feet of a school (Ord. 3016, 
3575, 4395, 4735). 
</P>
<P>
 -- You can only keep manure on your premises for seven days (Ord. 2066). 
</P>
<P>
 -- You cannot keep bees closer than 250 feet to a sanitarium (Ord. 2332, 
4395). 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, Read concludes: "I heard of a woman who killed her husband with a bow 
and arrow so she wouldn't wake the baby. If she'd done that in Glendale, she'd 
have broken the law. One cannot use a bow and arrow here (Ord. 596, 3465)."

RUNAWAY CAR KILLS GIRL AND INJURES SISTER; TRAGEDY: THE TWO WERE WALKING TO 
SCHOOL IN SAN PEDRO WHEN STATION WAGON WITHOUT BRAKES SWERVED INTO THEM. 
EIGHT-YEAR-OLD IS IN CRITICAL CONDITION. 
</P>

<P>
 Two young sisters strolling to a San Pedro elementary school Monday morning 
were struck by an out-of-control station wagon that swerved onto a sidewalk, 
killing one and critically injuring the other. 
</P>
<P>
 Lara Ramirez, 7, was killed instantly; her sister, Gezella, 8, who was thrown 
onto a lawn, was rushed to Harbor-UCLA Medical Center for treatment. She was in 
critical condition Monday afternoon as she underwent surgery for a severe 
injury to her left leg. 
</P>
<P>
 The driver, Gary Hartman, 31, of San Pedro lost control of his 1965 Jeep 
station wagon after his brakes failed while he was driving his two children to 
a nearby junior high school, said Officer Mike Cummins of the Los Angeles 
Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 As Hartman rolled down a hill on 19th Street toward South Alma Street, he 
swerved around several cars sitting at a stop sign, Cummins said. Hartman 
swerved again to avoid a car in the intersection and, at 25 m.p.h., slammed 
into the two girls who were waiting at the curb to cross the street. 
</P>
<P>
 The sisters, a second-grader and a third-grader, were about two blocks from 
Leland Elementary School when they were struck. 
</P>
<P>
 Gezella Ramirez called for her mother as she lay on a lawn in pain, said Debra 
Smeltzer, 32, a neighbor who held the girl's hand and prayed as paramedics 
arrived. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fortunately she landed on the grass," Smeltzer said. "That's probably how she 
made it." 
</P>
<P>
 Smeltzer tried to move away from Ramirez to let emergency crews treat her, but 
the girl gripped her hand even harder, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The more I prayed with her, the more she calmed down," Smeltzer said. "She 
kept holding on to me."  
</P>
<P>
 Hartman, who could not be reached for comment, stayed at home in bed and 
grieved throughout the day, said Bo Califano, 13, who lives with his mother and 
Hartman in a San Pedro home. "He was just lying there crying," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at the elementary school called in psychologists to help children 
cope with news of the accident. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many of the kids don't comprehend it," Principal Richard Vladovic said. 
Officials visited many of the school's classrooms to discuss the accident and 
the children's feelings, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We talk about how precious life is and about how we need to remember to love 
the sister that's in the hospital," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Samuel Smeltzer, whose wife, Debra, had aided Lara Ramirez, said the 
intersection is very busy and called for a crossing guard to help children 
across the street in the morning. 
</P>
<P>
 But Vladovic disagreed. "I don't know if it would have made any difference," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hours after the accident, neighbors stood outside their homes and grieved.  
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sad," said Lina Cavedoni, 65, who walked from her home a block down the 
street to place a bouquet of white flowers at the site. "A girl is dead."

THE LIGHT COMES ON AT THE DWP; MAJOR SEXUAL HARASSMENT PROBLEM -- NEARLY 100 
COMPLAINTS -- IS REVEALED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The last year hasn't been a good one for the Department of Water and Power. 
First the employees struck for a pay raise; then the managers went hog-wild in 
feeding themselves at public expense during the work stoppage. Now a major 
sexual harassment problem comes to light within the nation's largest 
municipally owned utility. 
</P>
<P>
 If the DWP's management knew of the problem -- as it acknowledges it did -- 
why did the harassment continue? It turns out that nearly 100 sexual harassment 
complaints have been filed at the DWP over the last two years. 
</P>
<P>
 The scope of the problem surfaced only last week after the utility agreed to 
pay a $1.5-million settlement -- the highest ever by a government agency in 
California -- to Ruby P. Zilly, a former DWP security guard. 
</P>
<P>
 The number, severity and legal costs of these sexual harassment cases were 
unknown to the public and even top city officials, including City Councilwoman 
Jackie Goldberg, who has been reviewing sexual harassment incidents and 
policies in the city work force. She plans to hold hearings next month to 
question DWP officials on their sexual harassment policies. 
</P>
<P>
 The fact that even a DWP commissioner was unaware of the nearly 100 cases and 
learned of the Zilly case only last month raises concerns about the quality of 
oversight by agency management. 
</P>
<P>
 DWP management recently noted that it takes time to change attitudes toward 
sexual harassment in the workplace. OK, but just how hard has management been 
trying? How long must women employees put up with behavior such as the 
outrageous physical assaults that have been alleged? 
</P>
<P>
 The DWP must hold managers accountable for monitoring harassment complaints 
and must create financial incentives for agency supervisors to enforce 
harassment policies. For example, when a complaint is found to be valid, the 
DWP could charge legal costs to the department in which the violation occurred. 
That would be a start in showing that the DWP means business in cracking down 
on sexual harassment.

HARD-CORE MENACES TO SOCIETY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Last year California paroled 86,792 felons -- an average of 237 each day. Most 
of these men and women were released with no public attention, often in a city 
far from where they committed their crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Allen Olds, however, will be unable to live unnoticed in the unidentified 
Northern California location to which he was paroled Monday. He is one in a 
select group of felons whose parole has attracted public attention. 
</P>
<P>
 Olds was convicted of second-degree attempted murder in the 1987 attack on 
now-Los Angeles City Councilwoman Ruth Galanter. After confessing to breaking 
into Galanter's home and stabbing her, he was sentenced to 14 years and four 
months. With standard credit for good behavior and work assignments, he was 
eligible for release after just seven years. That seems as outrageous to us as 
it does to Galanter.  
</P>
<P>
 Yet with murderers, rapists and the like walking out of prison every day, this 
sort of outrage seems attached mostly to felons whose crimes were particularly 
heinous or whose victim, like Galanter, was a public figure. An infamous 
example in the first category is Charles Rothenberg, paroled in 1990 after 
serving seven years for setting his 6-year-old son afire in a Buena Park motel. 
The child suffered third-degree burns over 90% of his body and has endured 
years of reconstructive surgery and skin grafts. Until he completed his parole 
last year, Rothenberg was the most closely guarded parolee in the state system. 
 
</P>
<P>
 Corrections officials say Mark Olds will be under their supervision for three 
years and subject to a number of restrictions. Indeed, it is a good bet that 
Olds, as Rothenberg was, will be closely monitored. But Olds' parole, which 
came after just half his sentence had been served, has generated outrage 
precisely because Californians know that too many other paroled felons have, 
unnoticed, violated the similarly strict terms of their release.  
</P>
<P>
 That the corrections system is overloaded is beyond dispute. But keeping close 
tabs on parolees with a history of violence should not depend on their infamy 
or the prominence of their victim. A lot of politicians are enamored with the 
"three-strikes" approach. But in many cases that approach may serve only to 
give the wrong people long prison terms. Better to find ways to keep true 
menaces like Rothenberg and Olds behind bars as long as possible, and under 
supervision long after that.

IRAN-CONTRA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Times on Sept. 11 carried a news item that dealt with former National 
Security Adviser Robert McFarlane's account of "who knew what, and when they 
knew it" regarding the Iran-Contra escapade. Although much of what was 
reportedlele had been suspected by many people, I find it remarkable that this 
story has not been followed up with further information in your newspaper or on 
television or radio. 
</P>
<P>
 I "heard" no response from the Messrs. Reagan, Bush or North, as though they 
found it quite all right to walk around this messy puddle, or did not consider 
it important enough to deny what was reported. 
</P>
<P>
 Had this been reported in a more timely manner, I feel confident that it could 
have been considered the "smoking gun" that might have contributed to yet 
another presidential resignation for cause. 
</P>
<P>
 At this point, only one shoe has dropped.

FREEDOM WATCH; ANDERSON'S FILES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Terry Anderson spent 6 1/2 years as a hostage in Lebanon and now he wants to 
learn as much as possible about what his government knew of his ordeal, what it 
knew about his radical Muslim captors and what it did to try to win his 
freedom. Washington bureaucrats, however, apparently regard this information as 
none of Anderson's business. 
</P>
<P>
 His requests for relevant files under the Freedom of Information Act have been 
rejected, and so now Anderson has filed suit against 13 government agencies, 
including the FBI, the CIA and the State Department. Why the rejections? An FBI 
form letter to Anderson says that before records can be handed over all persons 
named in them must sign notarized "waivers of personal privacy." Presumably 
this would require Anderson to return to Lebanon and get his former tormentors' 
permission to see the files. Simple enough. 
</P>
<P>
 The mind boggles at this latest manifestation of bureaucratic obtuseness and, 
far worse, at the disregard of the Freedom of Information Act underlying it. 
Anderson, as he has made clear, isn't asking for the names of informers or 
secret agents. He's asking for information about his ordeal at the hands of 
terrorists. Is his government now really more concerned about the "privacy" of 
those thugs than about the rights of one of its victimized citizens? 
</P>
<P>
 Common sense along with common decency makes clear this is not something that 
should have to be resolved in a courtroom. Let the proper officials issue the 
orders to give Anderson the information he's entitled to. Anything less would 
be indefensible.

AUTHORITARIANISM AND ISLAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The authors of "The Tyranny of Brotherhood" (Commentary, Sept. 18) are being 
too kind to the West. 
</P>
<P>
 The truth is that there are tyrannies in the Arabic wleorld that enjoy the 
exigent support of the West in their pliant ways. There is reference ad nauseum 
to the "Iranian-backed Hezbollah" but a convenient blind eye is turned to 
$3-billion-a-year-backed Egyptian dictator. The so-called elections that were 
held to install Hosni Mubarak make even the old Brezhnev type of 99% majority 
in the Soviet Union look respectable. Saddam Hussein, before he strode into 
Kuwait, was openly supported by America and European countries while he was 
frittering away his oil millions in arms purchases. The shah of Iran was 
championed as a statesman while his secret service was busy imprisoning and 
torturing anyone who dared speak out. 
</P>
<P>
 In the media, Islam is daily abused, villified and ridiculed, yet the behavior 
of indigenous Muslims is not such as to warrant any ire. Islam is 
systematically misrepresented by Christian and Jewish so-called experts as it 
suits their purpose to do so. Every cudgel is taken up so long as some 
stereotyping of Muslims is implied. Salman Rushdie and Taslima Nasrin are 
almost canonized with an callous disregard for the anguish caused to the 1 
billion Muslims of the world.

 There is a common weakness in our human psyche that compares our best with 
somebody else's worst. This is not only true of interpersonal relationships but 
also of interreligious encounter. Christianity and Islam, ancient formidable 
enemies, have been guilty of this practice for centuries. Unfortunately, in 
many parts of the world and in many parts of this country, it still exists. 
That is why it is very heartening to read the magnificent article by Maher 
Hathout and Salam Al-Marayati. 
</P>
<P>
 Their exposure of the genuine spirit of Islam and also of its historical and 
contemporary abuse must be seen as the first step for all religions, including 
Christianity, to take a hard objective look at the essence of their respective 
religious traditions and acknowledge their historical and contemporary abuses 
and extremisms. 
</P>
<P>
 It would be wrong to judge any movement only by its extremes. Religious wars 
were fought not because of religion but rather in spite of it.

GATT VOTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Your Sept. 18 editorial urging Congress not to "waffle" and "delay" on 
approving GATT and, implicitly, urging that we dispense with democratic process 
via "fast-track" authority, is imperialist, ends-versus-means, nonsense. 
</P>
<P>
 What GATT and NAFTA represent is no less than a "trade" coup by capital.They 
are inherently illegitimate trade policies because they have not emanated from 
Congress and the people. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason for a sick, unbalanced "trade" process derived from NAFTA and GATT 
is that the agreements excluded labor's participation. They were written, even 
dictated, by "revolving-door" lawyers representing capital alone, whose entire 
livelihoods and professional careers are based on multinational patronage.  
</P>
<P>
 Without labor and the people's full participation, all such "trade" agreements 
are not only illegitimate but destined to induce great costs and turmoil and 
fail.

SIERRA CLUB CLOUT, DESERT LEGISLATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 More than a half-million Sierra Club members around the country must be 
wondering which Sierra Club your reporter ("Environmental Movement Struggling 
as Clout Fades," Sept. 21) was referring to, and why he paints such a bleak 
picture of leour movement. 
</P>
<P>
 Fading clout? Ask a member of Congress from Delaware who received hundreds, if 
not thousands, of calls and letters on the California desert bill. Ask a local 
activist in Kansas who participated in one of more than 50 press conferences 
around the country on the EPA's dioxin reassessment. Ask a member of a 
community organization like the Jesus People Against Pollution in Mississippi 
working with the Sierra Club to clean up a local toxic waste dump. 
</P>
<P>
 Over and over again, the message is clear. While our opponents, who for 
obvious reasons are our most vocal detractors, try to suggest we are losing 
ground, or that we are losing touch with the economic realities of the country, 
or that we have grown big and unwieldy, this is most often a poorly disguised 
effort to divert attention away from our very real strengths. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, the Sierra Club has a book publishing division and a division 
that oversees wilderness expeditions and a legal division and a political 
action committee and a lobbying office not because we have lost our sense of 
mission, but because we have found over our 102-year history that these are 
precisely the tools we need to educate and mobilize the people of this country 
to make real and lasting changes in public policy. 
</P>

 The article struck a nerve! It portrayed the plight of a disillusioned Sierra 
Club member, James Connor of Montana. Apparently, Connor left the Sierra Club 
because the organization endorsed a bill that threatens to put 35 million acres 
in five states under wilderness protection. This draws a direct parallel with 
our situation in California and the desert bill. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Connor, I am a longtime Sierra Club member and have served in several 
responsible positions. For more than eight years I have been actively involved 
with the desert bill and have thoroughly explored the proposed wilderness areas 
with other Sierra Club members on behalf of the club. Our findings have been 
written down, depicted on appropriate maps and presented to the Sierra Club 
Council and executive committees. An 81-page document of findings intended to 
provide valid information so the desert bill could be appropriately modified 
and corrected, where needed, has been purposefully unacknowledged.  
</P>
<P>
 Although I strongly favor more desert protection, I know that the current bill 
has been misrepresented and is too extreme.

 The economic downturn we have labored under for the last few years has 
significantly cut back the amount of funding available for many nonprofit 
organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 The few very large organizations mentioned in the article may or may not have 
management difficulties due to their considerable size. Whatever the answer to 
that question, this limited sampling does not comprise an adequate survey. 
</P>
<P>
 The disagreement in the ranks about how to address certain environmental 
concerns is not surprising given the complexity of the problems being 
addressed. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite ups and downs, the environmental movement is not a fading fad any more 
than breathing clean air or having beautiful natural surroundings is a fad. 
With or without national legislation, major gains are being made toward a more 
sustainable future as people are coming to understand that good business and a 
healthy, balanced ecology are compatible rather than at odds.

 The Times told it like it is in "Desert Bill -- a Messy Anticlimax" 
(editorial, Sept. 22). After using every possible parliamentary trick to try 
and derail the California Desert Protection Act, the final chapter of the 
bill's tortuous legislative path is now being played out in a 
behind-closed-doors filibuster in the Senate. This latest election year assault 
on the desert bill threatens to undermine final enactment of the bill and 
thereby the ecological and economic future of the California desert. 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond these deliberate attempts to govern by gridlock and deep-six the bill, 
another threat to it is an alternative compromise package that pays homage to 
the year-end habit of members of Congress to festoon bills headed to the 
President's desk with extraneous legislative adornments. This package faces an 
uncertain reception in the House, where it could be rejected or modified and 
sent back to Senate -- leading us back to where we are now.

 It may be true that Hollywood movie makers and the medieval Norman were both

PLATFORM; A SHAKY POLICY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB HEINEMAN, a Farmers insurance agent in San Juan Capistrano, is concerned 
that no major insurance company in the state will write new home and earthquake 
policies. He told The Times: 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This situation goes back to Proposition 103 in 1988, which gave an elected 
insurance commissioner power to cap insurance rates. The Northridge quake 
triggered the insurance slowdown when losses forced companies to consider 
raising premiums, which the commissioner would block. 
</P>
<P>
 Take Farmers' experience as an example: Farmers has collected about $450 
million in earthquake premiums since it has been in business. Farmers' quake 
payouts over the past few years, including Northridge, are more than $3 
billion. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to see that $450 million in 
premiums can't pay $3 billion in losses. 
</P>
<P>
 The state's insurance crisis sure isn't helping economic recovery. What can be 
done? 
</P>
<P>
 Let insurance companies squirrel away 100% of the earthquake premiums they 
collect, without penalty or tax, to cover future quake claims. Allow insurance 
companies to pool their resources to pay for The Big One by changing laws that 
stand in the way of such cooperation. And, of course, abolish the 
commissioner's power to fix the price of insurance.

PERSPECTIVES ON COURTROOM TELEVISION; CAMERAS ENSURE PUBLIC CONFIDENCE; ONE 
DISPUTED REPORT ISN'T WORTH THE RISK OF CUTTING ALL DIRECT ACCESS TO A TRIAL AS 
CONTROVERSIAL AS SIMPSON'S. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUGLAS E. MIRELL and RAMONA RIPSTON, Douglas E. Mirell, a partner in the 
Los Angeles office of the law firm of Loeb and Loeb, is a volunteer attorney 
representing the American Civil Liberties Union in the Simpson case. Ramona 
Ripston is executive director of the ACLU of Southern California. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Superior Court Judge Lance A. Ito has guided the O. J. Simpson murder trial 
into jury selection under a cloud with profound implications for freedom of the 
press and the public's right of access to its justice system. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, Ito again castigated alleged inaccurate reporting by television 
station KNBC, about a story linking a sock found in O. J. Simpson's bedroom to 
the slain Nicole Brown Simpson. Ito and others have called the story grossly 
inaccurate. 
</P>
<P>
 The story may or may not be accurate; it may not be the most responsible 
report ever broadcast in Los Angeles. However, its accuracy -- or the judgment 
involved in broadcasting it -- is not the real question here. 
</P>
<P>
 Ito has served notice that he intends to hold a hearing this week on 
terminating all electronic media coverage of the trial. Not only is this 
proposed punishment unrelated to the media's alleged violation, but it poses 
serious legal and practical problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Ito has a legitimate -- indeed, critical -- interest in seeing that Simpson 
receives a fair trial. But the judge knew that when, on Aug. 2, he entered an 
order specifically allowing television cameras in his courtroom and setting 
ground rules for broadcasters to place cameras elsewhere in the Criminal Courts 
Building. 
</P>
<P>
 Absolutely nothing has happened in the past two months to indicate that those 
initial findings -- that electronic coverage would not impair Simpson's fair 
trial rights -- were wrong. Indeed, over the past weekend, even members of 
Simpson's defense team publicly opposed ending electronic courtroom coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 From the perspective of public policy as well, such a decision would make no 
sense. First, pulling the plug would not address Ito's complaint with KNBC, 
which based its story not on events in the courtroom but on information 
obtained from confidential sources outside. It is illogical to impose in-court 
punitive measures when out-of-court practices have enraged the judge. 
</P>
<P>
 In the media world of the late 20th Century, television cameras are no 
different from the pencils and note pads of newspaper reporters. Television is 
a unique medium, effective because it brings to its audience the faces, 
inflections and words of its sources. To deny television camera access to the 
trial is to bar the public from witnessing the proceedings -- in a system of 
justice that the people pay for and in which the people must have confidence. 
</P>
<P>
 If anything, the frequency of stories like KNBC's disputed report will only 
increase under the action contemplated by Ito. The reality is that in-court 
proceedings become the news story on days when court is in session; they also 
act as a check on the mainstream media's need or desire to conduct independent 
investigations. 
</P>
<P>
 The ultimate irony of Ito's position is that the very existence of electronic 
media coverage of the Simpson trial serves to limit or eliminate any damage 
that otherwise prejudicial information might cause. His nationally televised 
condemnations of KNBC's story have more than fully mitigated whatever damage 
may have been done by the original report. 
</P>
<P>
 As a practical matter, limiting television coverage from the courtroom would 
work a hardship on all news media, since most reporters covering the trial rely 
on the live television feed as a practical alternative to crowding into a 
courtroom far too small to accommodate them. Reports prepared by those excluded 
from the courtroom would inevitably be less reliable and accurate. 
</P>
<P>
 The importance of assuring the public that the Simpson trial is fair and open 
to public scrutiny is paramount. Nothing will guarantee that outcome with 
greater certainty than continuing to afford the nation an electronic eye and 
ear into Ito's courtroom.

SCHOOL CONSTRUCTION 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 * Despite the fact that literally billions of dollars worth of school 
construction projects are awaiting funding, the California Assembly recently 
defeated a measure to place a school construction bond measure on this 
November's statewide ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 Local Assembly members Doris Allen (R-Cypress) and Tom Umberg (D-Garden Grove) 
were among those who voted in favor of the bond measure and are to be 
congratulated for supporting public education and the state's schoolchildren. 
It is unfortunate that some of their colleagues do not share the same 
priorities.

ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE; UNHEALTHY APPROACH TO HEALTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It stands to reason that an organization that will deliver health care to well 
over 100,000 Latinos in Orange County would take pains to see that members of 
that community are involved in the planning process -- at the top. 
</P>
<P>
 But the seven-member board of directors of the Orange County OPTIMA program 
contains no Latinos, despite complaints a year ago from community groups asking 
for a voice in establishing this important new agency. Now those complaints 
have prompted an investigation by the federal Health and Human Services 
Department. Regardless of the outcome, Latino voices must be heard within 
OPTIMA. 
</P>
<P>
 The new agency is due to begin operations next year, replacing the Medi-Cal 
program in Orange County. The laudable purpose is to have a local and less 
cumbersome bureaucracy create a program to serve the poor better by emphasizing 
prevention rather than waiting for treatment of a medical crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 The need has grown even since the program was approved more than a year ago: 
Due to a worsening economy, those eligible for help are now estimated at nearly 
300,000, up from 225,000. 
</P>
<P>
 A Latino leader estimated that as many as 80% of those treated will be Latino. 
Unfortunately, of 128 people who applied for positions on the OPTIMA board, 
only three were Latinos. OPTIMA officials were aware of that a year ago and 
said others who expressed interest never re-established contact with the 
agency. 
</P>
<P>
 But OPTIMA should have done more follow-up and strongly encouraged those who 
expressed interest. In the future it must work with Latino groups to make sure 
their members know of this chance to serve. After all, when the Orange County 
Grand Jury was criticized for lacking minority members, community groups helped 
recruit members to increase diversity on the panel. 
</P>
<P>
 Seven is an arbitrary number. Why not make it eight, and for starters see to 
it that the additional member is Latino? This new agency must not get off to a 
bad start with the community it will serve. Its task is too important.

PRO FOOTBALL DAILY REPORT; RAIDERS; HOSTETLER SAYS HE'S NOT GETTING CALLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE SPRINGER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Now in his second season as a Raider, quarterback Jeff Hostetler has been a 
human blocking dummy, taking shot after shot without uttering a word of 
complaint. 
</P>
<P>
 Hostetler would rise, sometimes on shaky legs, brush himself off and make it 
back to the huddle one way or the other, knowing more of the same kind of 
punishment was probably coming. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, the Raider quarterback has finally decided he's not going to take it 
quietly anymore. 
</P>
<P>
 The final blow came in Sunday's loss to the San Diego Chargers at the 
Coliseum. Hostetler was pushed out of bounds, then felt he was further 
interfered with in front of the San Diego bench. No penalty was called. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Art Shell said Monday he will ask league officials to look into the lack 
of roughing-the-passer calls against those who come after his quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey, I'm all for clean, hard-fought games," Hostetler said. "Guys can hit as 
hard as they want. I haven't said anything yet to this point, but I might as 
well say it. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I had a different number on, I probably would have gotten one 
(roughing-the-passer call) by now. . . . The fact is, it hasn't happened. The 
fact is, I've taken some big hits, and the fact is, I don't have the (fortune) 
of other guys who will get the call." 
</P>
<P>
 Did Hostetler feel believe someone on the Charger side deliberately tried to 
hurt him? 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know," he said. "I got hit in bounds, went out of bounds and someone 
over there gave me something. Hey, it's part of the game. . . . If that 
includes getting hit, I'm in there. I haven't walked away from any of that 
yet." STEVE SPRINGER

FINANCIAL MARKETS; DOLLAR RISES ON HOPES FOR JAPAN ACCORD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The dollar rose broadly Monday, posting one of biggest single-day gains 
against the Japanese yen this month, on optimism for a trade deal that will 
help cut the nagging U.S. deficit with Japan. Stocks closed mixed and yields 
were unchanged or nudged upward. 
</P>
<P>
 Across-the-board weakness in the German mark amid uncertainty about next 
month's federal elections in Germany and the possibility of another U.S. 
interest rate hike today also helped advance the dollar, market participants 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the near term, a rate increase would boost the U.S. currency by making 
dollar-denominated deposits more attractive. 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar surged nearly a full yen in Europe on news that Japanese Trade 
Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto would meet in Washington with top Clinton 
Administration officials, seeking to head off U.S. sanctions in advance of a 
Friday deadline. 
</P>
<P>
 In London, the dollar rose almost a full yen to 98.63 yen from 97.65, ending 
the day even higher in New York at 98.85. The mark was at 1.5537 marks, up from 
1.5480. 
</P>
<P>
 Stock prices closed mixed as investors geared up for today's key meeting of 
the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee, which could decide to boost 
interest rates for a sixth time this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 17.49 points at 3,849.24, but in 
the broader market, declining issues beat advances 1,137 to 977 on New York 
Stock Exchange volume of 271 million shares. The Nasdaq index ended down 1.83 
at 755.63. 
</P>
<P>
 "Certainly the broad market direction is still down. Frankly, this could be a 
pretty wild week," said John H. Shaughnessy, director of research for Advest 
Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 Many market strategists believed the central bank would postpone any action 
until at least next month, but several investment banks, including Goldman 
Sachs & Co. and Bear, Stearns & Co., predicted a rate hike. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once that's out of the way one way or another, I think there's a good chance 
the market may have a little bit of a bounce here," said Walter Revis, market 
analyst at Principal Financial Securities. 
</P>
<P>
 The yield of the Treasury's main 30-year bond rose to 7.79% from 7.78% on 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Standard & Poor's composite index of 500 stocks rose 1.15 to 460.82. The 
American Stock Exchange index was off 1.45 to 453.78. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Monday's market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Investors dumped Micron Technology and Texas Instruments after a CS First 
Boston analyst lowered ratings to "hold" from "strong buy" reportedly because 
of pricing pressures in the market for dynamic random access memory chips. 
</P>
<P>
 Texas Instruments tumbled 3 3/4 to 68 1/4 and Micron dropped 2 to 36. 
</P>
<P>
 * Another big loser was Mercantile Stores, which plunged 16 3/8 to 38 3/4 on 
the NYSE after the retailer revealed that merger discussions were terminated 
with a "third party" it did not identify. 
</P>
<P>
 * CBS Inc. rose 3 3/4 to 340 5/8 and Capital Cities/ABC Inc. gained 1 3/8 to 
82 1/4 on reports that Walt Disney Co. had lost interest in a deal for General 
Electric's NBC network, analysts said. Disney may now turn its attention to 
CBS. 
</P>
<P>
 * A cold, dry winter in Brazil that has already hurt coffee is now hurting the 
orange crop. Orange juice prices soared to four-month highs Monday. The 
November frozen orange juice contract rose 4.4 cents to 99.35 cents a pound, 
the highest since June 3. 
</P>
<P>
 * Gold on New York's Commodity Exchange fell $1.80 to $394.30 per troy ounce.

 Johnny Oates, whose high-priced lineup did not produce enough to satisfy 
ownership, was fired as manager of the Baltimore Orioles. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orioles were 63-49, second in the American League East, under Oates when 
the players went on strike Aug. 12. But new owner Peter Angelos expected more 
because of free agents Rafael Palmeiro, Sid Fernandez and others. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orioles did not announce Oates' replacement. They reportedly have been 
interested in Oakland's Tony La Russa, whose contract expires soon, and will 
ask the Dodgers for permission to talk to former Oriole Rick Dempsey, the 
manager at triple-A Albuquerque. 
</P>
<P>
 Oates took over as manager when Frank Robinson was fired in May of 1991. In 
his first full season, the Orioles went 89-73 in 1992 and finished third. They 
were 85-77 and tied for third in 1993, marking their first consecutive winning 
seasons since 1984-85.

 Desperation? Safety Dennis Smith, 35, former USC standout, was brought out of 
retirement by the Denver Broncos to play against the Buffalo Bills on Monday 
night.

<P>
 I had a dream. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The Rams kept winning after shutting out Joe Montana and the Kansas City 
Chiefs. Noisy, partisan crowds began filling Anaheim Stadium. The Rams edged 
the San Francisco 49ers for the NFC West title. Georgia Frontiere sold the Rams 
to an Orange County group that kept the team in Anaheim. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Just a dream. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Incidentally, I had a nightmare a couple of months ago. It was October and 
there was no World Series. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Don't expect Al Davis to make any drastic changes in Raider coaching or 
playing personnel the rest of the season. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Davis is loyal, to a fault, to those employees he likes. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 However, the team probably will have to mount a comeback and reach the 
playoffs for Art Shell to retain his job next season. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The offensive line doesn't block very well for the running backs, but the 
rushing attack might be respectable if Leonard Russell had been acquired 
instead of Harvey Williams. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders couldn't complain about the lack of a true home-field advantage 
Sunday. The crowd was 13,000 short of capacity, but one of the most vocal I've 
ever heard at the Coliseum. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 This plea was posted on the message board before kickoff: "Be a team player!!! 
Root responsibly. Raider football is a contact sport, but let's keep the 
contact on the field. Thanks." . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The television commentator the Arizona Cardinals need most is Jimmy Johnson, 
not Phil Simms. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Including their 38-35 loss to the Minnesota Vikings at Minneapolis on Sunday, 
the Miami Dolphins are 6-5 in games in which Dan Marino has passed for more 
than 400 yards. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Is it just my imagination, or do NFL tight ends always seem to be open? . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Colorado quarterback Kordell Stewart's "Hail Mary" pass that beat Michigan 
makes him an early contender for a certain award that Boston College 
quarterback Doug (Hail Mary) Flutie won in 1984. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 USC tailback Shawn Walters was more powerful than ever Saturday night when he 
rushed for 207 yards against Baylor and he also showed some nifty, new moves. . 
. .  
</P>
<P>
 The Trojans must be the only team in the nation with a 225-pound starting 
tailback, Walters, and a 200-pound starting fullback, Terry Barnum. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Hawaii is 0-2 against Western Athletic Conference teams and 2-0 against the 
Pac-10. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Auburn, Washington and Texas A & M are unranked by USA Today/CNN because that 
poll doesn't recognize teams that are on probation. . . .  
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Al Campanis will return to baseball as vice president in charge of player 
personnel of the Palm Springs Suns of the new Western League that begins play 
next May. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Former Dodger and Angel catcher Bill Sudakis has been named manager of the 
Suns. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 There will be a 90-game schedule and none of the eight teams will have a major 
league affiliation. Oh yes, there will be a salary cap -- $24,000 a month, per 
team. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Billy Ashley, the Pacific Coast League's most valuable player, plans to work 
on his defensive skills in left field this week with the Dodgers' team in the 
Arizona instructional league. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 According to the University of California Wellness Letter, nearly 70% of all 
baseball injuries result from sliding. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Look-alikes: Jeff George and Wade Boggs. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Two of the four people elected to the National Track and Field Hall of Fame 
last week, deceased Olympic gold medalists Lillian Copeland and Cornelius 
Johnson, were graduates of L.A. High. . . . Don Klosterman, who will receive 
the "Pride of Lions" award from Loyola Marymount on Saturday at the Red Lion 
Hotel near LAX, set eight college football passing records during his career. . 
. .  
</P>
<P>
 Who's going to pay to watch new World Boxing Council heavyweight champion 
Oliver McCall defend his title against the likes of Franz Botha, Tony Tucker, 
Bruce Seldon or Peter McNeely? They sound like Showtime cable shows, not 
pay-per-view. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Of course, the idea is to keep McCall winning until another Don King fighter, 
Mike Tyson, gets out of prison. Tyson would attract a huge TV audience against 
anyone, including his ex-sparring mate McCall. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The Julio Cesar Chavez-Meldrick Taylor show at the MGM Grand Garden on Sept. 
17 drew a near-capacity paid crowd of 14,261 and a gate of $4,298,219. An 
additional 1,045 paid $52,250 to watch a closed-circuit telecast elsewhere in 
the hotel. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The Lakers might not have to give the Phoenix Suns a draft choice until 1997 
and that makes the deal for Cedric Ceballos a steal. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Best wishes for a speedy recovery to George Raveling. I'm worried about how 
the gourmet will react to hospital food.

THOMAS LEADS WAY AS BILLS DROP BRONCOS TO 0-4; AFC: RUNNING BACK SCORES TWO 
LATE FIRST-HALF TOUCHDOWNS AND BUFFALO HOLDS ON FOR 27-20 VICTORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Buffalo and Denver know how to lose Super Bowls -- seven of the last eight to 
be precise. 
</P>
<P>
 The Broncos, 0-4 and off to the worst start in their history, are learning how 
painful regular-season losses can be. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest one came Monday night when Thurman Thomas ran for two late 
first-half touchdowns and Carwell Gardner scored early in the third quarter as 
the Bills beat the Broncos, 27-20. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Bills looked like the same team they've been the last four years. They 
didn't look any different to me," Denver coach Wade Phillips said. "Our guys 
played hard but we made too many mistakes and it cost us the ball game." 
</P>
<P>
 It might cost Phillips more than that. 
</P>
<P>
 The Broncos, considered Super Bowl contenders when the season started, have 
started 0-4 only once before, in 1964. And that got Jack Faulkner fired as 
coach, a fate that could be awaiting Phillips if Denver fans get their way. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bills took advantage of two turnovers during a winning spurt that spanned 
both halves, scoring 21 of their 27 points in 3:36. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas, who gained 103 yards in 17 carries before leaving with an injured 
right knee early in the third quarter, went in from 16 yards with 1:54 left in 
the half. 
</P>
<P>
 He then scored from the 27 with 18 seconds left after Bruce Smith sacked John 
Elway and forced a fumble that was recovered by Cornelius Bennett. Coach Marv 
Levy said Thomas' injury "doesn't appear to be real serious." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to his fumble recovery, Bennett had six tackles, two sacks and 
forced Elway to throw high on the Broncos' final play. 
</P>
<P>
 "We did get a momentum swing with the fumble," he said. "But with John Elway 
at quarterback, you can never say you've got them licked." 
</P>
<P>
 Gardner scored 1:42 into the second half to make it 24-7 after Mickey 
Washington's interception, the fifth thrown by Elway this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Until then the Bills (3-1) couldn't muster much offense against a team that 
had allowed an average of 37 points in its first three games and lost four 
starters to injury in the first 18 minutes -- running back Rod Bernstine, 
cornerback Ray Crockett, offensive tackle Russell Freeman and defensive end Dan 
Williams. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernstine is lost for the season with a torn knee ligament.

PRO FOOTBALL DAILY REPORT; RAMS; THIS OLD SHOE DIDN'T BOTHER LANDETA 
</P>

<P>
 Punter Sean Landeta opened his equipment bag at Arrowhead Stadium on Sunday 
and discovered he had packed three left shoes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had one right one that was a practice shoe, definitely nasty looking with 
holes and threads dangling down," Landeta said."I wore my street gym shoes to 
kick in pregame warmups so I didn't get my feet wet (in the rain). I was afraid 
my socks would get soaking wet. I borrowed scissors from the trainer before the 
kickoff to cut the threads off (the ratty right shoe) and look presentable." 
</P>
<P>
 Landeta not only looked good, but worked his way into the record books after 
averaging 52.5 yards on four kicks. 
</P>
<P>
 Landeta, who bought 10 pairs of shoes for $90 as a sophomore at Towson State 
in 1980, tied Parker Hall (1939) and Danny Villanueva (1962) for the top 
single-game average in Ram history. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have two pairs left," said Landeta, who will return to using his regular 
games shoes Sunday against the Atlanta Falcons. "I'm not superstitious, so I'll 
go back to my regular game shoes. The practice shoes just have too many holes." 
</P>
<P>
 Landeta is averaging 46.6 yards this season. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Chuck Knox said he does not expect offensive tackle Darryl Ashmore to be 
ready for Atlanta, but there's a chance guard Leo Goeas will be. Ashmore has a 
knee injury and Goeas an ankle problem. . . . Linebacker Roman Phifer might sit 
out because of a hyper-extended elbow. . . . Defensive lineman Kevin Patrick, 
who has been on the practice squad, underwent arthroscopic shoulder surgery.

COLLEGE FOOTBALL DAILY REPORT; UCLA; DONAHUE: DON'T BLAME IT ALL ON COOK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM HODGES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Wayne Cook was sore Monday. His body ached because it had been pounded by the 
Washington State defense Saturday in a 21-0 UCLA loss at the Rose Bowl. His 
spirit ached because he had left the field to boos from the crowd in the fourth 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Terry Donahue is trying to rebuild his quarterback's confidence and his 
game, but he's not blind. Or deaf. 
</P>
<P>
 "Wayne Cook was a good enough quarterback last year to take us to a conference 
championship, and I think he's good enough this year to quarterback our 
football team," Donahue said. "I'm just not of the opinion that he's the only 
answer to our difficulties." 
</P>
<P>
 Donahue pulled Cook and put in Ryan Fien after Cook had been sacked seven 
times. 
</P>
<P>
 "The other night, he was physically abused because we couldn't protect him," 
the coach said. "That really isn't Wayne's fault." 
</P>
<P>
 But other things are? 
</P>
<P>
 "I do think that Wayne has made some poor throwing decisions this year," 
Donahue said. "I think he's pressing because he doesn't have his right arm out 
there." 
</P>
<P>
 The right arm, said Donahue, is wide receiver J.J. Stokes, who was injured in 
the Tennessee game and has played one half -- against Washington State -- 
since. Stokes aggravated his bruised thigh, causing swelling in the knee, and 
might be sidelined for several more weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 When Cook was replaced by Fien, it was something new to him but it might be 
something for him to get used to. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's fair to say that if your starting quarterback is struggling and 
continues to struggle, you're more inclined to make a quarterback change 
earlier," Donahue said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Stokes on fans booing Cook: "They're supposed to be cheering for us, but 
they're booing. If you don't like it, don't come out to watch us play." . . . 
Stokes' sitting out Saturday is music to the ears of Jim Lambright, 
Washington's coach. "When you lose a J.J. Stokes, who's such a huge tool, as he 
proved against us last year, it hurts your whole team," he said. Stokes caught 
four touchdown passes against Washington last season. 
</P>
<P>
 Sentencing for safety Tommy Bennett, who pleaded no contest a week ago to 
felony charges of grand theft and making a false financial statement, has been 
delayed until Wednesday. . . . Guard Matt Soenksen will probably sit out the 
Washington game, leaving the Bruins short in the offensive line. He will be 
replaced by Sean Gully or Chad Suter, which means that only two linemen who 
started against Tennessee in the season opener, left tackle Jonathan Ogden and 
center Mike Flanagan, will be starting at Seattle. JIM HODGES

COLLEGE FOOTBALL DAILY REPORT; USC; WALTERS' POWER IMPRESSES ROBINSON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 USC Coach John Robinson says his sophomore tailback, Shawn Walters, is on his 
way to becoming a Barry Foster or Jerome Bettis-type power back.  
</P>
<P>
 He certainly looked like it Saturday against Baylor, crashing off of or, in 
some cases, crashing over would-be tacklers on his way to a 207-yard night in a 
37-27 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson and his running backs coach, Charles White, have turned Walters from 
a back who viewed himself as a breakaway, run-to-daylight type to a power 
runner. And at 6 feet and 225 pounds, Robinson says Walters has room to grow. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's just now starting to seriously lift weights," Robinson said. "I think in 
a couple of years he can carry 240 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "He really did a nice job Saturday. He's reached the point where he now bursts 
into the secondary and hunts himself up a defensive back he can hurt." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 USC had no news regarding the status of tailback Delon Washington, who on 
Friday was benched because of questions regarding his eligibility. 
</P>
<P>
 A USC spokesman said Washington's status was "day to day," and Robinson said 
he was hopeful of a quick resolution.  
</P>
<P>
 The university, citing state and federal privacy laws, said it couldn't 
discuss the matter. EARL GUSTKEY

FAIRPLEX; STAKES RECORD SET BY FLORES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRED ROBLEDO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The David Flores show continued at Fairplex Park, where the five-time riding 
champion again put his name into the history book with a victorious ride on 
Shes A Sure Bet in the $50,000 Bangles And Beads Stakes Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The one-length victory over Klassy Kim was Flores' third of the day and his 
third stakes victory of the 19-day meeting, making him the all-time leading 
stakes rider at this track with 35.Francisco Mena has 34. 
</P>
<P>
 Flores, well on his way to his sixth consecutive title, now has 29 victories 
and a lead of nine over Fernando Valenzuela. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the riders in Monday's 6 1/2-furlong feature was Corey Black, a 
four-time riding champion himself. Black, who shared the title with Flores and 
Martin Pedroza in 1989, the last year he rode regularly at Fairplex, was making 
his first appearance at this meeting and had the mount on Tour. 
</P>
<P>
 Tour had one other thing going for him. He is trained by Dick Mandella, who 
had won this stakes three years in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 But this year and this day belonged to Flores. 
</P>
<P>
 Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Jockey Guillermo Gutierrez was thrown from his mount, Tizcomo, during the 
stretch run of the 13th race. Gutierrez, who wasn't injured, fell when Tizcomo 
stumbled, but the horse never went down. . . . Memo is drawn on the rail for 
today's $50,000 Governor's Cup at 6 1/2 furlongs. The field: Memo, Paul 
Atkinson, 124; Westcot, Antonio Castanon, 114; Ke Express, Fernando Valenzuela, 
115; Davey Be Good, David Flores, 116; Sharp Bandit, Martin Pedroza, 114.

blood clot in his right calf. 
</P>

COLLEGE DIVISION / ARA NAJARIAN: DIABETIC SOCCER PLAYER MAKING HER MARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ARA NAJARIAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Some records are special, not because of the nature of the feat but because of 
the people involved. 
</P>
<P>
 When Shelly O'Brien broke Azusa Pacific records Saturday for goals and points 
in women's soccer, they were special achievements. 
</P>
<P>
 Her three goals at Biola, all before halftime, gave her career marks of 36 
goals and 96 points -- goals count for two points, assists for one. A senior 
academically and a junior in terms of eligibility, O'Brien set the marks in 
about two years. 
</P>
<P>
 Those records might be eclipsed some day, but they will always be sweet to 
her. 
</P>
<P>
 Although O'Brien is a natural when it comes to soccer, the game has never been 
easy for her. She has been playing since she can remember and diabetic since 
she was 9. 
</P>
<P>
 She lives and plays with a device called an insulin pump. The pager-size 
device has a small tube that attaches at her stomach and is set to put 
appropriate amounts of insulin into her body over the course of the day. 
</P>
<P>
 When playing, the device goes under her arm, but inside a sock to keep it dry, 
and to pad it in case it gets hit.  
</P>
<P>
 "It can be a little uncomfortable, especially if it gets hit," she said. 
"There have been times when the pump has fallen out and even the tube has come 
out. But you just stop and pick it up or come off the field to fix it. You 
can't help but worry, but it's OK. If the tube comes out, you have to worry 
about infection." 
</P>
<P>
 She has only lately been wearing the pump, which she heard of about five years 
ago. It has been a great help because when she injected insulin four times a 
day, her blood-sugar level was difficult to control. That has improved with the 
pump. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's better because it kind of acts more like your pancreas," O'Brien said. 
"You can adjust the setting if you know you will be eating. But it can also be 
a little embarrassing -- like when I have a date, I say to myself 'Now where am 
I going to hide this?' You can't just put it in your purse."  
</P>
<P>
 She still has scars from all the insulin shots. And there are calluses on her 
fingers from pricks to test her blood-sugar level. She pricks her fingers about 
five times a day. 
</P>
<P>
 "What was bad was that I hated needles -- I still do. You get used to 
injecting yourself for the most part, and I won't let someone else give me a 
shot," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Diabetics have too much sugar in their blood and the pancreas does not produce 
enough insulin to control it. Fortunately, most diabetes can be controlled. But 
it is chronic and can have complications.  
</P>
<P>
 O'Brien was hospitalized in 1991 because of a kidney infection, then a month 
ago was in the hospital again because her thyroid was not functioning properly. 
She says neither is an uncommon side effect. 
</P>
<P>
 Even with the pump, O'Brien has to test her blood-sugar level before each 
game. If it is too high or too low, she can't play.  
</P>
<P>
 "In high school, I never used to check it," she said. "I used to go into 
convulsions in the middle of the night. A couple of times in the cafeteria I 
have had attacks. I get dazed and confused and might mention that I need food. 
But people (at Azusa Pacific) know what it is and they know who to call and 
what to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Not that she needs special attention. It's obvious by the way O'Brien 
interacts with her friends and teammates that she does not get special 
treatment for anything except her soccer skills and her personality. 
</P>
<P>
 This season, O'Brien is leading Azusa Pacific to its best start. The Cougars 
are ranked 10th -- their highest ever -- and are 6-0-1. O'Brien has 10 goals 
and 21 points.

 Chapman's football team has been all that was advertised. 
</P>
<P>
 The Panthers, resuming the sport, won their first game in 62 years two weeks 
ago at Whittier, 30-13, then beat Claremont-Mudd in their home opener last 
Saturday, 34-14. The excitement over the program is noticeable in attendance. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Whittier game, Chapman fans made up at least half of the announced 
attendance of 4,200. Then, for the home opener, Chapman packed 4,194 into its 
stadium, which is supposed to seat about 2,500 comfortably. Chapman's 
enrollment is only 1,800. 
</P>
<P>
 Noticeable about the Panthers, besides the winning, are their colors. 
Chapman's official colors are cardinal and gray, but the football team wears 
black helmets and jerseys with gray pants. There are no logos or stripes. 
</P>
<P>
 The no-frills approach is directly attributable to the $200,000 budget to run 
the program. Even something as little as stripes on the pants costs $2.20 each, 
so they are going without.  
</P>
<P>
 Of course, that's how traditions are born. 
</P>

 College Division Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Southland women's volleyball is enjoying a rebirth. Although Southern 
California is unquestionably the strongest spot in Division I volleyball, many 
Division II players choose to go out of state, where programs have more money 
and the players more opportunities to be team leaders. That appears to be 
changing. Cal State Bakersfield (11-0) is the top-ranked team in the nation and 
Cal State Los Angeles (14-1) is No. 2. Bakersfield lost to Northern Michigan in 
the Division II championship last season but avenged the loss in a three-game 
victory at the Metro State tournament this month.

THE PREPS / ERIC SHEPARD: BAKERSFIELD, BISHOP AMAT TO SQUARE OFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC SHEPARD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With no state playoff system for football, Saturday night's showdown between 
La Puente Bishop Amat and Bakersfield might be the closest thing to a 
championship game this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Each team is 3-0 and considered among the best in California. Bishop Amat is 
No. 1 in Cal-Hi magazine's weekly statewide ratings and Bakersfield No. 3. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the schools compete in different sections--Bishop Amat is in the 
Southern Section and Bakersfield the Central Section--the game offers a rare 
meeting of traditional powers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't set our schedule, but I don't mind traveling to Bakersfield," said 
Tom Salter, Bishop Amat's rookie coach. "I watched them Saturday night and 
they're very good. It's a long trip, but we'll be up for it." 
</P>
<P>
 In anticipation of a large crowd, the game was moved from the high school to 
Bakersfield College, which holds 20,000. Kickoff is at 7:30. 
</P>
<P>
 Fans will get a rare glimpse at the two most recruited running backs on the 
West Coast, Daylon McCutcheon of Bishop Amat and Steve Wofford of Bakersfield. 
</P>
<P>
 McCutcheon, 5 feet 10 and 175 pounds, is a converted wide receiver who has 
rushed for 504 yards and scored 11 touchdowns in three games. He is averaging 
11 yards per carry. Wofford, 5-11 and 175, has gained 512 yards this season, 
increasing his career total to 4,838. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither team has been challenged. Bishop Amat has outscored its opponents, 
108-27, and Bakersfield has won by an average margin of 26 points. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the second intersectional game in a row for Bakersfield, which is 
coming off a 35-13 victory over Antelope Valley on Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
 "I watched the game, and Bakersfield was more dominating than the score 
indicated," Salter said. "We're going to have to do a lot of things right to 
beat them." 
</P>

 Rialto Eisenhower, which finished as the state's top-rated football team last 
year with a 14-0 record, is struggling. 
</P>
<P>
 The Eagles were routed, 42-14, by Moreno Valley Canyon Springs on Friday in a 
nonleague game at Eisenhower. It was the team's most lopsided loss since Coach 
Tom Hoak took over 12 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our kids were really pumped up after the game," said Jack Fogarty, who has 
coached at Canyon Springs since the school opened nine years ago. "Everything 
just bounced our way and we executed very well. This is just another step up 
for our program." 
</P>
<P>
 Canyon Springs (2-1) is a Southern Section Division IV team but was rated No. 
12 in Cal-Hi's preseason state poll because it had 15 starters returning. 
Eisenhower (1-2) is the section's defending Division I champion and won last 
year's game, 41-19. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 City Section football teams begin conference play Friday and it couldn't 
happen at a better time. Many teams filled their nonleague schedules with teams 
from other sections and the results were mostly disastrous. 
</P>
<P>
 In 29 intersectional games, City teams were 5-24. They were outscored, 
696-248. 
</P>
<P>
 Carson, the defending Division 4-A champion, fared the worst. The Colts scored 
only 29 points in losses to Bishop Amat, San Diego Morse and Los Alamitos. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A girls' cross-country meet between Calabasas and Woodland Hills Louisville 
was called off Friday when the runners became frightened by a rattlesnake on 
the trail. 
</P>
<P>
 The dual meet at Malibu Creek State Park got started with no problems, but 
shortly after all 13 runners had crossed the mile mark they turned back 
screaming. Louisville's Shaluinn Fullove was leading the race when she noticed 
a rattlesnake spread across the trail. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of the girls just followed Shaluinn's lead," said Marie Murphy, 
Louisville's coach. "It was funny to watch all the girls come running back in a 
panic. Shaluinn kept asking me if she did the right thing, and, of course, she 
did what most other people would do." 
</P>

 The basketball season is still two months away, but already many of the 
Southland's top players are committing to colleges. 
</P>
<P>
 Doug Gottlieb, a 6-foot point guard from Tustin, said last week that he would 
sign with Notre Dame. North Hollywood's Arthur Lee, a 6-0 guard, plans to 
attend Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA has received unwritten commitments from 6-10 center Jelani McCoy of San 
Diego St. Augustine and 6-1 guard Brandon Loyd of Tulsa Memorial in Oklahoma. 
</P>
<P>
 Players can sign national letters of intent during the early signing period, 
Nov. 9-16. 
</P>
<P>
 Prep Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Streaks: Norco's 30-game winning streak ended with a 17-14 loss at Colton. 
Norco is the two-time defending Southern Section Division IV champion. Newbury 
Park, the defending Southern Section Div. II champion, saw its 16-game winning 
streak ended by Ventura Buena, 28-0. Meanwhile, Glendale Hoover and Garden 
Grove Santiago each ended slumps. Hoover, which had not won in 18 games, 
defeated Van Nuys Grant, 16-0, and Santiago righted itself after 17 defeats 
with a 17-3 victory over Buena Park. Huntington Beach Ocean View extended the 
state's longest losing streak to 32 games with a 39-13 loss to Santa Ana 
Century. 
</P>
<P>
 Fans allowed: When parochial school rivals Cathedral and Salesian played last 
football season, no fans were permitted. Escalating violence between the 
schools also prompted administrators to hold the game at a neutral site. 
Relations apparently are improving; Saturday afternoon's game at Roosevelt High 
will be open to the public. Times' Top 20 Football Poll

 Treasury Bill Rates Hit 3-Year High: Interest rates on short-term Treasury 
securities rose in Monday's auction to the highest level in three years. The 
Treasury Department sold $11.7 billion in three-month bills at an average 
discount rate of 4.79%, up from 4.61% last week.Another $11.6 billion was sold 
in six-month bills at an average discount rate of 5.22%, up from 5.05%. The 
three-month bill rate was the highest since they sold for 4.99% on Oct. 28, 
1991. The six-month bill rate was the highest since they averaged 5.23% on 
Sept. 23, 1991. The new discount rates understate the actual return to 
investors -- 4.92% for three-month bills with a $10,000 bill selling for 
$9,878.90 and 5.44% for a six-month bill selling for $9,736.10.

EXECUTIVE SUITE: COMPANY TOWN; SEALEY BAILS OUT OF INTERACTIVE NETWORK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Peter Sealey, the marketing wizard recruited to take charge of struggling 
Interactive Network Inc., is leaving the company, frustrated by delays in 
rolling out its TV game system nationally. 
</P>
<P>
 "The board and strategic investors have taken a more cautious approach to the 
national rollout, and that's not what I was brought aboard to do," he said. 
Sealey had joined the company only in January, after a high-powered marketing 
career at Coca-Cola and Columbia Pictures. 
</P>
<P>
 Interactive Network sells a device that allows viewers to play along with 
television sports and game shows at home. The company has lurched from 
financial infusion to financial infusion for the past four years, often 
appearing to be on the brink of collapse. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, the firm announced it had received $42 million in new financing 
from a group of investors, including Tele-Communications Inc., NBC, Motorola, 
Sprint and Gannett. Up to that point, the company had raised about $85 million 
since its founding in 1988. Over the six-year period, it has reported only 
about $2 million in revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite bold predictions at its founding that the firm would have millions of 
users by now, Interactive Network had just 5,100 subscribers at the end of 
1993, the most recent figures available. Its game system is available in three 
markets -- Sacramento, San Francisco/San Jose and Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 Sealey's departure was related to a switch in strategy that calls for putting 
the firm's technology in cable TV boxes rather than a hand-held remote-control 
device marketed directly by Interactive Network. 
</P>
<P>
 The change, which is said to be supported by cable giant TCI, has slowed by at 
least a year plans for the big national marketing campaign that Sealey planned 
to lead. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesperson for Digital Pictures Inc., a San Mateo interactive software 
company, said Sealey joined the firm as a consultant two weeks ago. His 
departure from Interactive Network is effective today. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Interactive Network Chief Executive David Lockton nor a firm spokesman 
returned telephone calls. JOHN LIPPMAN

THE BIZ / ALAN CITRON AND KATHRYN HARRIS: COMPANY TOWN; TIME WARNER MAY SEEK 
49% OF NBC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Now that Time Warner appears to have the inside track in discussions over 
General Electric's NBC, a minority deal may be the only way to keep federal 
regulators from the bargaining table. 
</P>
<P>
 Knowledgeable sources say that Time Warner could successfully skirt rules that 
prohibit cross-ownership of broadcast and cable properties by acquiring only 
49% of NBC. That may explain why the media giant remains in serious discussions 
after Walt Disney Co. walked away from the table on Friday over GE Chairman 
Jack Welch's refusal to sell the network outright. 
</P>
<P>
 GE is said to value NBC at $5.5 billion, based on an upsurge in advertising 
revenue and a renewed appreciation on Wall Street and in Hollywood of the Big 
Three networks as programming outlets. Sources say that Time Warner and GE are 
still attempting to work out the terms of a deal. Turner Broadcasting System 
and ITT Corp. are also said to be possible bidders for NBC. Nicholas W. Allard, 
a well-known communications lawyer in Washington, said Time Warner/NBC hasn't 
appeared on the radar screen inside the Beltway yet due to other unfolding 
events such as Congress' failure to pass new telecommunications legislation. 
But he said that any deal of that size is likely to draw some level of 
government attention, no matter how it's structured. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "This is yet another mega-deal that I'm sure the Federal Communications 
Commission will have a lot to say about," Allard said. "But it's not surprising 
that successful, muscular companies are looking for new alignments that will 
enable them to be even more competitive." 
</P>
<P>
 Time Warner declined comment on the discussions, but sources say Chairman 
Gerald M. Levin is determined to make a deal happen, since NBC would provide a 
vital outlet for programming. Experts say there are at least four separate 
regulatory hurdles to overcome if he succeeds. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1984, federal law has banned ownership of a broadcast TV station and 
cable TV systems in the same local market. In its largest cluster of cable 
systems, Time Warner provides service to nearly 1 million cable subscribers in 
New York City, where NBC also owns WNBC-TV. The New York market provides a 
compelling reason for Time Warner to settle for a 49% stake in NBC if that 
allows the companies to stay in both the cable and television business. 
</P>
<P>
 Until 1992, FCC rules prohibited any cross-ownership of national TV networks 
and cable TV systems. That year, the commission relaxed its rule to permit 
networks to own cable systems if the combination did not exceed 10% of the 
homes with cable available nationwide and 50% of such homes within a local 
market. 
</P>
<P>
 Both limits pose problems for Time Warner, whose cable systems are often 
available to more than 50% of the homes in a local market and to an estimated 
13% of the nation's 90 million homes within reach of cable. To compound 
matters, Time Warner recently struck a deal with Advance Publications and 
Newhouse Broadcasting that will give it effective control of an additional 1.4 
million subscribers. Still, the FCC has promised to reconsider those rules in 
1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Least troublesome, ironically, are the "financial interest and syndication 
rules" which kept apart studios and networks for more than two decades. 
</P>
<P>
 Those rules barred networks from selling off-network programming or owning any 
portion of the prime time shows not produced in-house. Networks are now allowed 
to own interests in network programming, but they are still prohibited from 
owning interests in first-run syndicated programs or from selling directly to 
TV stations in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The FCC is widely expected to permit networks to enter the syndication 
business, however, when the rule is reconsidered to meet a deadline late next 
year. And observers say that any network merger or sale could take that long to 
close. 
</P>
<P>
 Time Warner is said to be well into planning its strategy for overcoming those 
obstacles in the event of an NBC deal, though the company declined formal 
comment. Andy Schwartzman, a public interest lawyer with the Media Access 
Project in Washington, said he's still troubled by the magnitude of such a deal 
and would expect to see some sort of challenge mounted. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't begrudge Time Warner trying to cope with the new (media) 
environment," he said Monday. "But for the same reason that I thought it was 
important to restrain network power, I think it's inappropriate to let a movie 
studio buy one of three major networks." 
</P>
<P>
 Disney shares rose 75 cents Monday to $40.25 from Friday's 1994 low, while 
Time Warner fell 50 cents to $36 and GE gained 87.5 cents to $49.25. Turner A 
shares added 37.5 cents to $18.625. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand: While NBC may hope to avoid regulatory challenges in a deal 
with Time Warner, networks have also been known to use those regulations to

 In a complaint with the FCC, NBC is trying to head off a series of station 
purchases made through SF Broadcasting, a partnership involving Fox 
Broadcasting and Savoy Pictures, saying that Fox is trying to get around FCC 
limits on the number of stations it can own. 
</P>
<P>
 NBC is seeking to stop SF Broadcasting, which is 58% owned by Fox, from buying 
an NBC affiliate in Wisconsin. SF plans to buy four stations in all. Fox 
officials said that its passive investment in SF complies with all FCC 
regulations, and therefore stations acquired by SF don't count against the 
total stations Fox is allowed to own. 
</P>
<P>
 Under FCC rules, networks cannot own more than 12 stations or own stations 
covering more than 25% of the market. Fox owns eight stations and plans to buy 
two more. It also is an investor in New World Communications, which has 12 
network affiliates scheduled to become Fox affiliates.

 In the news: Comic Argus Hamilton, on Hillary Clinton raising $500,000 for 
Dianne Feinstein at a dinner: "That's nothing. Next day, Mike Huffington had 
breakfast by himself and raised $10 million." 
</P>
<P>
 Hamilton, on whether O. J.'s lawyers will let him testify: "The jury will know 
if he's telling the truth or lying. They've seen him in those 'Naked Gun' 
movies and know that he can't act." 
</P>
<P>
 Jay Leno, on O. J.'s frequent in-court whisperings to attorney Robert Shapiro, 
who generally just nods: "I figured out what's going on. O. J. is asking him, 
'Is this line of questioning going to cost me extra?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Lance Ito is still furious with KNBC for repeatedly saying DNA tests 
have proven that Nicole Brown Simpson's blood was found on O. J.'s footwear. 
Says comedy writer Tony Peyser: "It I were Ito, I'd tell Tracie Savage to put a 
sock in it."

 Peyser, on Haitian civilians ransacking Cap-Haitien over the weekend: "Among 
the looters was Damian (Football) Williams, who later claimed that he 'just got

 Science and airline update: Leno, on a study that says male monkeys take seven

course, with the monkey, there is a far greater chance that he will talk to you 
afterward."

Rome also suffered from dangerous air pollution levels: "They also reported UV 
indexes fluctuating between VII and XXIV."

 Comedy writer Mark Miller, on new genetically engineered mice that are meaner 
than average mice: "The procedure was done by combining the DNA from a regular 
mouse with that of Leona Helmsley."

 Miller, on the 100-plus starlings sucked into an engine of a United Airlines 
plane that flew through a flock: "It was the first time in history that 
passengers were offered seconds during meal service."

 Comedy writer Alan Ray, on American Airlines cutting 3,600 jobs: "Employees

 That's show biz: Motley Crue drummer Tommy Lee was involved in a scuffle

R S V P / ORANGE COUNTY; GYMNASIUM DRESSES UP FOR YWCA GALA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHRYN BOLD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Seventy proved a magic number for the YWCA South Orange County on Saturday 
when the association staged a 70th anniversary gala that raised about $70,000 
in net proceeds. Part of the funds will help the Y build a new 70-room housing 
project for homeless women. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 200 people attended the black-tie dinner at a gymnasium decked out 
like a ballroom at the YWCA's headquarters in Santa Ana. The $150-per-person 
dinner included a live auction led by Stacey Roman and performances by harpist 
Kathy Kavanaugh and singer Candi Milo. As Time Goes By 
</P>
<P>
 With gold streamers and hundreds of white twinkle lights hanging from the 
ceiling, the gymnasium was transformed into an elegant dining room. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not what you'd expect from a gym," said Michele Ryan, gala committee 
member. 
</P>
<P>
 Guests sat at tables draped in white cloth and adorned with tall topiaries 
decorated with white roses and moss. They were served a dinner of 
apricot-stuffed chicken and creme brulee for dessert, the work of Pennington 
caterers. 
</P>
<P>
 After dinner, the YWCA paid tribute to Betty Hutton Williams, a longtime 
supporter of the YWCA's programs for homeless women. Williams was escorted on 
stage to accept the YWCA Humanitarian Award while Milo sang her favorite song, 
"As Time Goes By," a fitting tune for the anniversary gala. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked why she supports the YWCA, Williams said, "No. 1, it's a women's thing. 
No. 2, I could be one of those women staying at the (YWCA) hotel." 
</P>
<P>
 The humanitarian award will be given annually to outstanding supporters of the 
YWCA. 
</P>
<P>
 "We thought our 70th anniversary was a good time to establish the award in 
Betty's name," said Bonny Schumacher, events chairwoman. Looking Back, Moving 
Forward 
</P>
<P>
 YWCA South Orange County was formed in 1924 to address the personal and 
professional needs of young working women. The organization first met at the 
Presbyterian Church in Santa Ana, where it provided social activities for young 
girls. 
</P>
<P>
 Today the association, which covers the southern end of the county from Santa 
Ana to San Clemente, has a $1.2-million budget and serves 18,000 women, girls 
and their families each year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been advocates for homeless women even in the 1980s when there was 
active denial that there were homeless women" in Orange County, said Mary 
Douglas, the organization's executive director. 
</P>
<P>
 Local programs include the YWCA Hotel for Homeless Women, four child-care 
centers and Grace House, a four-unit transitional apartment for low-income 
mothers and children. 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe this association is doing important work in the name of the YWCA. 
They're providing housing and job training, which women need desperately, and 
child care," said Ann Stallard, national president of the YWCA of the U.S.A. 
</P>
<P>
 Finding additional housing for homeless women remains a future challenge for 
the YWCA. The local association is currently launching a program to convert its 
gym into a 70-room apartment house. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to turn people away from the hotel every night," said Fran Williams, 
board president of the local Y. "I'd like to see that need reduced. I'd like 
every member of the community to know we're here, and to know support is here 
for them." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the guests were: honorary co-chairman Mario Antoci and wife Jane; 
Marjorie Fluor Moore, wife of honorary co-chairman Bob Fluor (who could not 
attend); Jo Caines, Peter and Mary Muth, Marsha Harper, Ann Bluto, Ruthelyn 
Plummer, Patricia McGuigan, Barbara Phillips, Arlene Sontag, Jean Aldrich, Rob 
Shell, Brenda Brown, Joan Lars, Lori Anderson, Wanda Lee and Billie Masters.

BOOK REVIEW / NOVEL; A COMPLEX, YET IDYLLIC, STORY OF CHILDHOOD IN VERMONT; 
NORTHERN BORDERS BY HOWARD FRANK MOSHER ; DOUBLEDAY $22.95, 291 PAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS GOODRICH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Childhood, as anyone in its throes will tell you, is a complex and important 
phenomenon. As adults, however, that's not how we remember our early years; we 
tend to romanticize youthful experience because it defines the adults we 
become, shapes our hopes and choices and temperaments to such a degree that we 
cannot reject our younger selves without simultaneously rejecting our mature 
identities. When push comes to shove, who among us would trade our own 
childhood for the apparently more satisfying childhood of another? 
</P>
<P>
 That should be a rhetorical question, but in "Northern Borders" Howard Frank 
Mosher has written a novel that will have readers lined up hundreds deep at the 
Childhood Exchange window. The childhood of Austen Kittredge III doesn't sound 
very promising at first -- who'd want to be sent away to the backwoods of 
northern Vermont to be raised and treated essentially like a farmhand by one's 
grandparents? -- but few readers will have reached page 50 in this truly 
radiant novel without wanting to be that young man. 
</P>
<P>
 Austen works long and hard all year, is mistreated at school, has few friends 
and becomes a weapon in his grandparents' decades-old, never-ending marital 
dispute, yet the dozen years he spends in Lost Nation Hollow, Kingdom County, 
are an idyll nonetheless. Austen, who narrates this novel as an adult, somehow 
knew even as a 6-year-old that he was privileged to have lived in a community 
of independent, admirably forthright people, a community that the electrical 
age would soon render extinct. 
</P>
<P>
 "Northern Borders" consists of 10 chapters, each of which is a self-contained 
short story focused on a particular character or incident. To summarize these 
chapters would be a disservice to the novel, however, for no synopsis could 
capture their complexities, and would imply, moreover, that the novel's main 
attraction is the eccentricity of its characters: the animal-loving farmer who 
buys an elephant at the county fair to prevent it from being shot, the aunt 
with a pearl-handled revolver who's rumored to have robbed a bank, the enormous 
schoolteacher who spends most of her class time drinking gin and punishing 
students with head- and arm-holds picked up from television wrestling. 
</P>
<P>
 Such characters do greatly enliven the book, but it's the voice of Austen 
Kittredge III -- observant, respectful, steadfast, direct -- that makes the 
novel sing. 
</P>
<P>
 Austen was sent to Kingdom County because a Kittredge ancestor -- a British 
sympathizer who settled in Lost Nation Hollow during the War of Independence 
under the impression that it was actually in Canada -- had donated land to 
Vermont with the proviso that graduates of the local "Atheneum" could attend 
the state college free of charge. The boy is at first ambivalent about leaving 
his widowed father, and his fears are not alleviated by the discovery that his 
grandparents are involved in what the natives know as "Ab and Austen Senior 
Kittredge's Forty Years' War." 
</P>
<P>
 Grandmother Abiah refers to her marriage to the elder Austen as the time she 
"fell afoul of Mr. Kittredge"; Grandfather Austen, for his part, is understood 
to see Abiah as his "wife and implacable adversary." Young Austen quickly takes 
to both of them, however, loving his grandmother's reverence for books and 
anything Egyptian -- she calls her grandson Tut, thinking he looked at birth 
like "the doomed young pharaoh" -- and his grandfather's willful, principled 
individualism, which leads the grandfather to change the course of the river in 
his own back yard and to take his grandson on a grueling, two-month canoe trip 
into unchartered parts of Labrador. 
</P>
<P>
 The ongoing battle between Ab and Austen provides the novel's backbone, most 
chapters at least referring to some grandparental skirmish -- Ab's desire to 
shoot the snowy owl that's killing her prize-winning chickens, Austen's 
determination to free a logjam above his sawmill and thereby flood Ab's apple 
orchard, the family reunions and holidays for which Ab works overtime and 
Austen refuses to attend. 
</P>
<P>
 Young Austen tells these stories without taking sides, amused by the conflict 
but conscious that the constant battles keep his grandparents alert and 
attentive and above all interdependent. Mosher doesn't leave the relationship 
at that, though: By the book's close we have learned of Ab's and Austen's 
difficult childhoods, and why they settled, however uncomfortably to the casual 
observer, for such a frightful alliance. 
</P>
<P>
 Ab's story is revealed in the penultimate chapter, when she wears herself out 
trying to rid the farmhouse -- using an electrical device, a vacuum, for the 
first time -- of a cluster-fly plague. Austen's is told in the final chapter, 
in the course of the Labrador canoe trip, which turns out to have much greater 
significance than he initially lets on. These two chapters are the most 
effective in the novel, and make clear why it's so good -- because Mosher has 
constructed the book like sedimentary rock, each chapter a stratum in young 
Austen's life and the layers becoming more dense, more profound, as the novel 
progresses. 
</P>
<P>
 The result -- thanks largely to Mosher's light touch -- is that although you 
may begin "Northern Borders" thinking of it as a typical seriocomic novel, you 
will likely end it thinking of "Huck Finn." Mosher, author of four other novels 
(including "Where the River Flows North," recently made into a movie), with 
this one has written a contemporary classic.

THEATER REVIEW; THE RIGHT SISTERS MAKE 'FLYIN' WEST' TAKE OFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY CHURNIN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Flyin' West," Pearl Cleage's post-Civil War tale of the founding of the 
still-existing all-black township of Nicodemus, Kan., offers up a tantalizing 
story, rich in detail and possibility. 
</P>
<P>
 San Diego Repertory Theatre realizes some of the potential in Cleage's 1992 
play. Its triumphs are the creation of slaves turned pioneers -- Miss Leah and 
Sophie Washington, magnificently played here by Irma P. Hall and Sylvia M'Lafi 
Thompson. 
</P>
<P>
 But the play needs judicious cutting and rewriting. At 2 1/2 hours, it's too 
long for its slender story, with much exposition wasted on telegraphing every 
turn. 
</P>
<P>
 The show is set in 1898. Years before, like tens of thousands of former 
slaves, Sophie Washington had seized the opportunity of the Homestead Act of 
1860 to claim free land for her and Dove sisters Fannie (Jackie Mari Roberts) 
and Minnie (Sarah Davis). Sophie, Fannie and Minnie consider themselves sisters 
although the relationship is never fully explained. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the story concentrates on the intrusion of Minnie's abusive 
half-white husband, Frank (Dominic Hoffman), who hates his black heritage and 
tries to make money selling Minnie's share of the land to white speculators. A 
subplot of romance between former slave Wil Parrish (Damon J. Bryant) and 
Fannie seems calculated to suggest a more positive male-female relationship. 
</P>
<P>
 Under Floyd Gaffney's sensitive direction, all the actors give spirited, 
appealing performances, looking at home on Ron Ranson's rugged set, wearing 
Judy Watson's authentic-looking pioneer clothes. 
</P>
<P>
 But many of the characters are thinly drawn, an exception being Hall's Miss 
Leah, an elderly neighbor who befriends the sisters. Hall, an unforgettable 
MaDear in the Old Globe Theatre's "Jar the Floor" last season, makes you feel 
the pain, the strength and the indomitable humor of a leathery old woman who 
has retained the scars and humiliations of slavery and can still look forward 
with hope. 
</P>
<P>
 Thompson, who plays Sophie as the tough, self-appointed protector of black 
pride, doesn't get enough lines to explain her character, but she acts so well 
between the lines she keeps the story vibrating through sheer force of will. 
</P>
<P>
 With more work by the playwright, this play could really fly. Even at this 
stage, it's exciting to see it stretch its wings. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Flyin' West," San Diego Repertory Theatre, Lyceum Stage, 79 Horton Plaza, 
San Diego. Tuesday-Saturday, 8 p.m.; Sunday, 2 and 7 p.m. Ends Oct. 8. $19-$25.

 We all have beliefs, emotions and personal stories of struggle, 
misunderstandings, failures and successes. But very few of us are able to 
transmute this material into works of art that resonate beyond ourselves and 
the particulars of our lives. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest problem with "Family Album," a group of installations and videos 
at the Cal State Fullerton Main Art Gallery (through Oct. 9), is that most of 
the artists seem content to present the raw data of personal experience without 
benefit of fresh metaphor, allusion, irony or wit. A drearily earnest air hangs 
over the project -- curated by Cal State Northridge art faculty member Betty 
Ann Brown -- which effectively kills its spirit and withers its good 
intentions. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the broad scope of the show is a liability. With work by 31 artists about 
such disparate subjects as the strains of second-generation ethnicity, 
non-traditional family units, childbirth, women's roles and familial 
dysfunction of various kinds, the net effect is rambling and diffuse rather 
than comprehensive. 
</P>
<P>
 The bad news starts at the entryway to the gallery, where doormats collected 
from Fullerton residents by Kathy Haddad and Jerry Mosher display the usual 
kitschy, upbeat imagery (houses, flowers, bears), with a few jokey dissenters 
(one mat says "Go Away"). 
</P>
<P>
 But the artists don't seem to have any particular thoughts about this stuff. 
They've assembled their raw data and have offered it without point of view or 
analysis. C'mon guys, this project may make for pleasant community relations, 
but it's not a piece . 
</P>
<P>
 In many cases, the stumbling block seems to be lack of craft and awareness of 
when a particular genre or style has outworn its welcome. 
</P>
<P>
 Where an artist such as Karen Finley (who is not in this show, alas) has 
evoked gut-wrenching feelings with rhythmic text scribbled on a wall, Rosalie 
Ortega's wall text in "Forgiveness" mainly evokes annoyance at her cliched 
writing. 
</P>
<P>
 The altar-like piece, bedecked with rose petals (a hackneyed format by now), 
is about coming to terms with having been abandoned as an infant by her young, 
abused mother. Ortega's inept approach makes it hard to care, or even to pay 
attention. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, Lynn Kubasek's shirts made of plastic and such household-related 
items as supermarket coupons and recipes are too close to their already cliched 
subject (woman as household drudge) to offer an original perspective. Oddly, 
even when Kubasek hits on a more metaphoric format (a shirt that has "grown" 
branch-like additional sleeves), she undercuts it with the ponderously literal 
addition of inscribed daily chores and habits. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Conversely, some pieces in the show sacrifice deeper meaning to the exigencies 
of craft. Katherine Ng's typographical and design skills are attractively in 
evidence in "Fortune Ate Me," a box of three-dimensional paper fortune cookies 
with an accompanying slide sequence. But the piece, like Ng's "My Name is Not 
My Own," seems to coast on the surface of issues of identity and relationship 
to one's immigrant forebears. 
</P>
<P>
 Other works don't seem to be about anything in particular (Bernice Colman's 
collages) or are too secretive to let us in (Diane Holland's baffling "Somatic 
Telesthesia" series). 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, there are pieces that offer mainly reportage (a videotape of Georgia 
Anne Middlebrook talking with her son Willie about what it's like to be black 
and gay) or swallow up a good concept with too much repetitive documentation 
(Cheri Gaulke and Sue Maberry's "Thicker Than Blood: Portrait of Our Lesbian 
Family," with its central conceit of having lesbian couples immortalize 
themselves a la Middle America by photographers at Sears). 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The video portion of the show -- curated by Meg Linton, co-owner of the 
Griffin Gallery in Costa Mesa -- unfortunately offers little relief. Too many 
of the artists seem to believe that old home movies provide such fascinating 
data and intrinsic appeal that they will work as straight visual "background" 
for virtually any voice-over with a family theme. There is too much boring 
babble (personal or sociological) and little wit or originality. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the few exceptions is Wallace Schultz's "Oh! Brother!" Using a 
combination of family snapshots, computer animations, re-enactments and 
symbolic images, Schultz probes his varying reactions to his older, gay brother 
throughout their often harrowing life. This excellent piece is honest and often 
shockingly revelatory without losing a sharp, self-aware edge. 
</P>
<P>
 In keeping with the artlessly autobiographical tone of the show, an 
accompanying limited edition artists' book contains a grab bag of personal 
stories, snapshots, drawings and poems by the artists and several other 
contributors. (By far the best piece, Buzz Spector's essay "Some Family 
Photographs" neatly reverses the usual expectations by giving us a sharply 
focused running commentary and letting us imagine the accompanying snapshots 
spanning 28 years of his life.) 
</P>
<P>
 The book also contains Brown's curatorial statement in which she explains that 
the show was conceived as a response to the Republican Party's emphasis on 
traditional "family values" during the 1992 presidential election campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Wishing to make a case for the legitimacy of non-traditional families is a 
laudable aim. But the best art is multivalent and open-ended. It resists being 
reduced to sloganeering or waving the flag for any particular cause. By 
choosing works that tend to be either uncommunicative or hackneyed and 
one-dimensional, Brown has weakened seriously the potential impact of the show. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Family Album" continues through Oct. 9 at the Cal State Fullerton Main Art 
Gallery, State College Boulevard (north of Nutwood Avenue). New fall hours: 
Noon to 4 p.m. Monday, Tuesday, Thursday; 3 to 7 p.m. Wednesday; 2 to 5 p.m. 
Sunday (closed Friday and Saturday). Admission: free. As part of his piece, 
Michael Lewis Miller invites the public to a buffet pot luck "reunion dinner" 
-- bring a covered dish -- Oct. 9 from 2 to 5 p.m. (714) 773-3262.

POP MUSIC REVIEW; WITH LOVE SPIT LOVE, BUTLER LEAVES FURS FOR A NEW STYLE

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Psychedelic Furs were one of the most compelling acts to emerge from 
Britain in the post-punk era, borrowing some of the Sex Pistols' nasty edge and 
mixing it with David Bowie's cold romantic flair. Now its leader, Richard 
Butler, has a new band called Love Spit Love, which landed at the Coach House 
on Sunday to play new music without any of the crossover pandering that ruined 
the Furs. 
</P>
<P>
 The absence of any old Furs hits in the hourlong set was proof enough Butler 
has some new ideas, though "Am I Wrong?" did come close to re-creating those 
edgy pop hooks the Furs perfected in the '80s. Much of the rest was just 
charged and moody enough to undoubtedly scare some of the Furs' more casual pop 
fans away. And no one in the crowd called out any Furs requests. 
</P>
<P>
 Butler sang in a raw, less mannered style than he has in years, at times 
playfully supplementing his vocals with blasts through a bullhorn or kazoo. 
Guitarist Richard Fortus chopped at his guitar with a clenched fist to create 
melodies with a harsh finesse. Fortus also picked up an acoustic guitar and 
joined Butler for an encore ballad whose delicacy demonstrated that Butler is 
not limited to the sounds of his past. STEVE APPLEFORD

 Striking a less dark note were the second-billed Gigolo Aunts, a quartet prone 
to upbeat, dual guitar interplay. Playing songs from the new "Flippin' Out" 
album, the band offered music that was pleasantly optimistic in tone, but not 
yet distinctive enough to be memorable.

THEATER REVIEW; PROMISING 'FLYIN' WEST' AT SAN DIEGO REP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY CHURNIN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Flyin' West," Pearl Cleage's post-Civil War tale of African Americans who 
founded the still-existing all-black township of Nicodemus, Kan., offers up a 
tantalizing story, rich in detail and possibility. 
</P>
<P>
 San Diego Repertory Theatre realizes some of the potential in Cleage's 1992 
play. Its triumphs are the creation of slaves turned pioneers -- Miss Leah and 
Sophie Washington, magnificently played here by Irma P. Hall and Sylvia M'Lafi 
Thompson. 
</P>
<P>
 But the play needs judicious cutting and rewriting. At 2 1/2 hours it comes in 
too long for its slender story, with much exposition wasted on telegraphing 
every turn. 
</P>
<P>
 The show is set in 1898. Years before, like tens of thousands of former 
slaves, Sophie Washington had seized the opportunity of the Homestead Act of 
1860 to claim "free" land for her and Dove sisters Fannie (Jackie Mari Roberts) 
and Minnie (Sarah Davis). Sophie, Fannie and Minnie consider themselves sisters 
although the relationship is never fully explained. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the story concentrates on the intrusion of Minnie's abusive 
half-white husband, Frank (Dominic Hoffman), who hates his black heritage and 
tries to make money selling Minnie's share of the land to white speculators.  
</P>
<P>
 Under Floyd Gaffney's sensitive direction, all the actors give spirited, 
appealing performances, looking at home on Ron Ranson's rugged set, wearing 
Judy Watson's authentic looking pioneer clothes. 
</P>
<P>
 But many of the characters are thinly drawn, a notable exception being Hall's 
Miss Leah, an elderly neighbor who befriends the sisters. Hall, an 
unforgettable MaDear in the Old Globe Theatre's "Jar the Floor" last season, 
makes you feel the pain, the strength and the indomitable humor of a leathery 
old woman who has retained the scars and humiliations of slavery and can still 
look forward with hope. 
</P>
<P>
 Thompson, who plays Sophie as the tough, self-appointed protector of black 
pride, doesn't get enough lines to explain her character, but she acts so well 
between the lines she keeps the story vibrating through sheer force of will. 
</P>
<P>
 With more work by the playwright, this play could really fly. But even at this 
state of development, it's exciting to see it stretch its wings. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Flyin' West," San Diego Repertory Theatre, Lyceum Stage, 79 Horton Plaza, 
San Diego. Tuesdays-Saturdays, 8 p.m.; Sundays, 2 and 7 p.m. Ends Oct. 8. 
$19-$25. (619) 235-8025. Running time: 2 hours, 30 minutes.

 OH DANNY BOY: Sometimes prosecutors' compliments come from the people they 
send to prison. Mission Viejo socialite Danny Hernandez, now serving a six-year 
sentence in a multimillion-dollar fraud scheme, wants a new attorney to handle 
an appeal for him. . . . Hernandez complains that he got a raw deal in the plea 
agreement his lawyers worked out with Assistant U.S. Atty. Steve Wolfe. 
Hernandez has written from prison that his lawyers let Wolfe "bully" them: "I 
feel I was left out in the cold as far as my plea agreement." 
</P>
<P>
 CAN'T DUCK THIS SHOT: The Visiting Nurse Assn. of Orange County, a nonprofit 
home health group, is trying to spread the word that it's flu season again. So 
it's kicking off its annual flu shot campaign by lining up some mighty 
high-profile people to immunize today: the players and coaches of The Mighty 
Ducks. . . . You can find a flu clinic in your neighborhood by calling (800) 
616-SHOT. 
</P>
<P>
 FAST THROWER: How would you like a pitcher with these stats: 145 strikeouts in 
60 innings -- then he hits .687 when it's his turn to bat. Those are the Little 
League numbers for 12-year-old Jared Fast of Huntington Beach, 5-8, 210 pounds. 
. . . He took first place for his age group last weekend in Dallas at the Major 
League Baseball's pitch, hit and run finals for youngsters. Fast's reward: a 
trip for two to next year's All-Star game in Texas -- if the baseball strike is 
settled. 
</P>
<P>
 NO JOKE HERE: If you're tired of bad lawyer jokes, here's a brighter look at 
the local bar. The Orange County Bar Assn. has just been awarded the 
prestigious Pro Bono Service award for public service by the California Bar for 
its efforts to assist victims of last year's Laguna Beach fires. . . . The 
bar's fire relief task force trained more than 100 attorneys in the basics of 
disaster legal services. Those attorneys then gave free legal advice through 
the Disaster Application Center in Laguna Beach.

GENERATION GAPS FILLED AT CHURCH CENTERS; GENEALOGY: MORMON FAMILY HISTORY 
LIBRARIES ARE PACKED WITH CLUES TO THE PAST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By JEFF McDONALD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES

<P>
 After a career fighting fires for the city of Los Angeles, Gerry Mathews of 
Fillmore spends most of his time these days sifting through 200 million names, 
stringing together his family roots. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a task he had pursued in his spare time for 30 years -- interviewing 
relatives distant and close, roaming libraries and mailing off inquiries to 
halls of records across the western United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "I worked on it by hand for a long time," said Mathews, 53. "I used to send my 
$2 to the courthouses, but maybe you'd get the records back and maybe you 
wouldn't." 
</P>
<P>
 Bit by bit, Mathews traced his ancestry back 200 years, when his relatives 
first migrated to Los Angeles. But he ran into a dead-end about seven 
generations back, losing track of who married whom and who died when. 
</P>
<P>
 It was then that he enlisted the help of the Church of Jesus Christ of 
Latter-day Saints, the Utah-based ministry that maintains a genealogical 
library of more than 200 million names. 
</P>
<P>
 Within days after he contacted the church, Mathews was able to piece together 
more of his past. "That's when I really got hooked on it," he said. "Now I'm 
back to the 1300s." 
</P>
<P>
 The Mormon Church has been documenting births, deaths and marriages for 
generations, carefully reconstructing the bonds that create families. 
</P>
<P>
 The information is collected from newspapers and county offices by church 
researchers in Salt Lake City, where millions of documents are maintained in a 
waterproof vault. The records are vital to the church's mission of preserving 
family heritages and can be used to posthumously baptize relatives, a church 
official said. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this month, Ventura County's newest family history center opened at 
the Mormon church in Fillmore. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Fillmore center, located in a small office behind the chapel and equipped 
with computers and microfiche, joins genealogical libraries in Thousand Oaks, 
Simi Valley, Camarillo, Ventura and Ojai. Each of the branches are open to the 
public free of charge. 
</P>
<P>
 "It gives people the sense of being part of a larger group," said Madeline 
Winmill, a volunteer who assists a dozen or more visitors at the Fillmore 
family history center each week. 
</P>
<P>
 "I found out that my husband and I are eighth cousins," Winmill said. "We 
started seeing the same names in our family trees." 
</P>
<P>
 Debbie Burnett, another volunteer librarian at the Fillmore office, said she 
has found a possible relation to Sir Francis Drake among her ancestors, 
prompted by a letter from a distant grandmother mentioning the English hero. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can trace it that far, but I'm missing a link," Burnett said. "So I'm going 
to go into the church records in England and see what else I can find." 
</P>
<P>
 At the Simi Valley center, Dorothy Johnson works several hours a week to track 
her history. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have my family roots all the way back to 1635 on my mother's side," the 
Simi Valley mother of five said. "But I've found nothing at all on my father's 
side. I know his mother died young, and I don't know her name." 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley branch librarian Luana Swade said her office sees about 40 
visitors a week. 
</P>
<P>
 "They just want to know about their roots," Swade said. "Each one has their 
own reasons, but they all have a desire to know about their families. This is 
what makes history come alive for them." 
</P>
<P>
 More than 75% of those who investigate their heritage at the genealogical 
libraries are not members of the Mormon church, said Karen Sycamore, who 
directs the Thousand Oaks branch. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once you begin to delve into this, it becomes somewhat addictive, like a 
puzzle or mystery to solve," she said. "You get a sense of knowing your 
grandparents by the records they kept, why they emigrated when they did." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Sycamore said she has tracked part of her lineage to the 12th Century, and 
found among her ancestors a famous martyr who was executed under the rule of 
Queen (Bloody) Mary Tudor of England. 
</P>
<P>
 "It does give you a sense of pride, because you realize he was a man of great 
conviction," she said of John Rogers the Martyr, who was killed for eschewing 
the queen's religious beliefs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would like to live up to that legacy he gave to us," Sycamore said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mathews, the retired firefighter from Fillmore, said there are other rewards 
to tracking one's ancestors. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you need a reason to have a party, what the heck," he said. "It's always 
somebody's birthday." HISTORY CENTERS

COUNCIL FINDS TIME TO LIMIT LATE-HOUR VOTES; CITY HALL: OFFICIALS HOPE STARTING 
MEETINGS A HALF-HOUR EARLIER WILL PREVENT FATIGUE FROM INFLUENCING POLICY. 
</P>

<P>
 The Ventura City Council, weary of making important decisions in a sleepy 
haze, agreed Monday to begin their meetings a half-hour earlier so they would 
cast fewer votes late at night.  
</P>
<P>
 Council members said they could improve democracy and clear up the city 
staff's bleary eyes on Tuesday morning by preventing their weekly meetings from 
running late into the night. 
</P>
<P>
 At a workshop Monday evening, the council members decided to start their 
meetings at 7 p.m. instead of the usual 7:30, and to ask city staff to keep 
their oral reports to less than three minutes. Six of the seven council members 
also got a short lesson in parliamentary procedure, which they promised to 
observe. Councilman Greg Carson was absent from the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 The council members stopped short of changing the meeting time to 5:30 p.m., 
accommodating Councilman Jim Monahan, who said he liked to "go home, take a 
shower, and eat dinner" before council meetings, and Councilman Gary Tuttle, 
who also said he preferred eating dinner at home with his wife. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the time change can be implemented, the council must bring it up as a 
resolution for an official vote at an upcoming council meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members conceded that their own long-windedness is sometimes the 
reason for meetings dragging on into the night, but warned that burning the 
midnight oil can be dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think anyone is thinking very clearly at 1 o'clock in the morning," 
said Councilman Steve Bennett, who proposed starting the meetings at 5:30 p.m. 
"We've all been sort of punch-drunk." 
</P>
<P>
 Bennett said that if the meetings started earlier, more of the public would be 
able to observe the council and contribute their opinions. 
</P>
<P>
 Several members contended their high energy levels made it easy for them to 
wake up early on Tuesday mornings after late-night meetings. "I have high 
energy and am accustomed to working long hours," Councilwoman Rosa Lee Measures 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 City staff, however, readily acknowledged that the late-night meetings take a 
physical toll. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is difficult when meetings run late . . . being expected to be in and at 
work the next day," Community Services Director Everett Millais said. 
"Everybody is tired." 
</P>
<P>
 Opinions differed on the causes of late nights and long meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of times they take as long as they do because we have a lot of work to 
do," Mayor Tom Buford said. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Gary R. Tuttle was less charitable. "Sometimes council members have 
a tendency to talk way too much," he said. "Some council members waste our time 
with stupid questions." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Tuttle said he feared that the effort to quicken the meetings might end up 
stifling debate and public participation. "We're trying to get too 
businesslike," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jack Biller, who attends council meetings regularly, also worried that ending 
the meetings earlier would entail limiting public participation. "If they're 
going to shut the public off more than they're shut off already, then that's 
real bad," Biller said.  
</P>
<P>
 At Monday's workshop, several council members raised concerns about limiting 
public debate. For that reason, they rejected a proposal to establish a set 
adjournment time for council meetings. They also agreed to allow the public 
time to comment at the start of council meetings held on the first Monday of 
each month. Normally, public comments are scheduled at the end of the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, the move to end meetings earlier may make them longer. If the 
meetings start earlier, at least one councilman expects the rhetoric to expand 
to fill the newly available time. 
</P>
<P>
 "The council members will never limit themselves. They'll always have the last 
word," Tuttle said.

NAVY HOLDS MANDATORY SEMINARS ABOUT AIDS; DISEASE: OFFICIALS SAY THE TWO-HOUR 
SESSIONS, FOR SAILORS AND CIVILIANS, DETAIL SAFE-SEX PRACTICES AND OTHER WAYS 
TO PREVENT SPREAD OF VIRUS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 In an effort to combat the spread of the deadly AIDS virus, Navy officials 
this month ordered about 15,000 sailors and civilian employees stationed in 
Ventura County to undergo a mandatory seminar on prevention of the disease. 
</P>
<P>
 The two-hour session, which all sailors and civilian workers must attend by 
Dec. 1, details safe-sex practices and other ways to prevent the spread of the 
virus, Navy officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The seminar covers what is known about the disease, risk factors, the rights 
of employees with the chronic illness and the Navy's AIDS testing and 
anti-discrimination policies. The AIDS awareness seminars are put on by Navy 
medical personnel with the help of volunteer instructors from the American Red 
Cross. 
</P>
<P>
 To meet the Dec. 1 deadline, the Red Cross is training an additional dozen 
instructors to help with the seminars for the estimated 6,500 uniformed 
personnel and 8,500 civilian workers. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a very big task, but it is also an exciting challenge," said Susan 
Habel, HIV/AIDS education chairman and training coordinator for the Ventura 
County chapter of the American Red Cross. "We are limiting the class size to no 
more than 50 people at a time so you can see how many sessions we are going to 
have to hold," Habel said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Habel has spent months preparing for the sessions at the Naval Construction 
Battalion Center in Port Hueneme and the Naval Air Weapons Station at Point 
Mugu. "The nice thing is that we have received a lot of support from the local 
commanders. They realize how important this project is." 
</P>
<P>
 Navy officials said the program is part of the federal Workplace HIV/AIDS 
Education Initiative issued by President Clinton last spring. That initiative 
was made the policy of the Navy and Marine Corps earlier this summer by Navy 
Secretary John H. Dalton. 
</P>
<P>
 Dalton, in a memorandum issued last May to all base commanders, stated that 
the numbers of military personnel contracting the human immunodeficiency virus 
-- the precursor to AIDS -- are growing within the ranks nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 "The facts are: Each year 300 active duty Navy and Marine Corps personnel 
become infected with HIV, and an increasing number of dependents are being 
infected as well," Dalton wrote. "Commands must make a firm commitment to 
educate all personnel about HIV/AIDS if we are to prevent the spread of this 
disease, dispel myths and reduce deaths." 
</P>
<P>
 The first wave of seminars began last week at both bases. 
</P>
<P>
 "I found (the training seminar) very informative," said Marge Hays, a Navy 
spokeswoman at Point Mugu.  
</P>
<P>
 Hays said the instructor wasted no time in explaining specific ways the virus 
can and cannot be spread, and the proper use of condoms. 
</P>
<P>
 "If everybody educated their work force to this extent, I don't think we would 
have the size problem we do with this disease today," she said. "They really 
got down to the nitty-gritty and provided us with some useful information." 
</P>
<P>
 At the end of each session, each person in attendance also receives a referral 
list of local agencies that provide counseling and other services for those who 
have contracted the virus.

PART OF THE SOLUTION; BOY WHO BROUGHT BRASS KNUCKLES TO CLASS MATURES INTO 
SCHOOL BOARD ADVISER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAIA DAVIS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Following the lead of school trustees across the state, the Ventura County 
Board of Education has begun to appoint student representatives to give youths 
a voice on the board. 
</P>
<P>
 But the first youth named to the new position breaks the mold of the typical 
student school board member. 
</P>
<P>
 Pete Roina, who took his seat on the county school board Monday, wears his 
shoulder-length hair in a ponytail with the sides of his head shaved. He 
prefers baggy knee-length Army fatigues to slacks and stretches long white 
socks above his high-top, black leather boots. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only does he look different than the typical clean-cut students appointed 
to school boards, the 16-year-old has had a more troubled past than many youths 
honored with such leadership roles. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time he was 13, Pete said, he had been arrested twice, was using 
alcohol and drugs and had caused so many problems at his Santa Paula school 
that officials finally asked him not to return. 
</P>
<P>
 He enrolled at Gateway Community School in Camarillo, a continuation school 
run by the county Superintendent of Schools for students who have flunked out, 
been kicked out or been unable to adjust to regular schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides Gateway, the county runs schools for youths who are in jail or who 
attend special-education programs. 
</P>
<P>
 And Pete will represent all 3,600 of these students at the county-run schools 
on the school board. 
</P>
<P>
 His appointment to the post marks a sharp change from the days when Pete was 
best known as a troublemaker. 
</P>
<P>
 Between the ages of about 9 and 13, he said, he was constantly having 
difficulties in school and with the police. Arrested once for stealing money 
from his mother and another time for carrying brass knuckles to school, he said 
he was put on probation until he was 21 but expects soon to have the probation 
terminated because of good behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 Pete said he has given up alcohol and drugs. He has earned enough school 
credits to enroll in a regular high school in Santa Paula next January. And he 
has emerged as a school leader, serving both on the student council and on 
committees with school staff. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Although Pete attributes his turnaround mainly to the support of his mother 
and Gateway, he also said his behavior problems seemed to lessen as he matured. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of it was growing up," he said. "I grew out of it." 
</P>
<P>
 As Gateway Assistant Principal Jeanne Dukes said: "He has just crossed the 
fence from being a problem at school to being a solution at school." 
</P>
<P>
 Dukes added that Pete's past troubles may help rather than hinder his work as 
a student board member, giving him insights into the difficulties that many 
young people face. 
</P>
<P>
 "He can speak for the masses of kids," she said.  
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Pete's fellow students at Gateway said one reason they accept him as a 
leader is that they know he is not afraid to speak his mind or stick up for his 
classmates' point of view. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, at Pete's urging, Gateway organized a daily all-school break so 
students -- who work mainly in independent study or small groups -- would have 
a chance to socialize and get to know each other. 
</P>
<P>
 Pete acted as disc jockey during the break periods, selecting music he thought 
his classmates would enjoy. 
</P>
<P>
 "He will, like, speak for us," 16-year-old Eddie Soto said. "He's ready to 
speak his opinion." 
</P>
<P>
 And that is what school board members say they want. 
</P>
<P>
 Like student representatives on most school boards, Pete will be unable to 
vote but free to join in discussions of matters that pertain to students. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Hearing from a student representative, Board President John McGarry said, "is 
a chance to give the board some insight." 
</P>
<P>
 "We thought that it would constantly help us as board members to be focused on 
why they're there," McGarry said. "We sometimes get sidetracked. If you're 
serving on a board of education, if you lose sight that you're there for 
children, you've really lost sight of what you're there to do."

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; HAZARDOUS WASTE DISPOSAL PLANNED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Residents of Simi Valley, Moorpark and nearby communities can dispose of toxic 
household wastes that cannot be dumped with the weekly garbage during a 
Household Hazardous Waste Roundup on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 At the roundup, participants can dump such materials as motor oil, paints and 
solvents, pool chemicals, fertilizer, antifreeze, batteries and 
fluorescent-light tubes. 
</P>
<P>
 Participants can make appointments to dump the toxic materials by calling the 
Simi Valley Environmental Services Department at 583-6321. Once given an 
appointment, residents will be mailed an admission pass identifying the 
disposal location. 
</P>
<P>
 No more than five gallons of liquid waste will be accepted nor will more than 
50 pounds of solids. The exception is for motor oil, which can be brought in 
four five-gallon containers. 
</P>
<P>
 Although they make up only a small portion of landfill garbage, hazardous 
household wastes account for a large part of the toxic materials at community 
dumps, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pat Pieres, solid waste programs analyst for Simi Valley, said the city dumps 
about 230 tons of hazardous household waste a year at the Simi Valley Landfill. 
That is less than 0.1% of total rubbish, but a large part of its toxic waste.

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; REWARD ASKED IN PIZZERIA ROBBERIES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Hoping to nab the thieves who have robbed five Thousand Oaks pizzerias, 
Sheriff's Lt. Mike Brown tonight will ask the City Council to put up a $1,000 
reward for information leading to convictions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes a reward makes all the difference in the world," Brown said."It's 
brought witnesses out in the past . . . it can be just enough to make or break 
(a case)." 
</P>
<P>
 Crime Stoppers has already offered a $1,000 reward in the case, but Brown said 
he wanted to up the ante. 
</P>
<P>
 Detectives suspect that three or four people have been robbing restaurants up 
and down the coast. They have hit 15 restaurants between Agoura and San Luis 
Obispo, including the five Thousand Oaks pizzerias, Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police have arrested one suspect, Christopher Bass of Goleta, but are still 
looking for two or three others, Lt. Bill Montijo said. 
</P>
<P>
 To track down Bass, Ventura County sheriff's deputies teamed up with the 
Ventura and Oxnard police departments, and the Santa Barbara police and 
sheriff's departments. Each department is now working on its own to identify 
additional suspects, Montijo said. STEPHANIE SIMON

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; CITY COUNCIL TO VOTE ON POLICY 
CHANGES 
</P>

<P>
 Thousand Oaks' community goals haven't changed much in the past 24 years, but 
city leaders figure they could use a little fine-tuning. 
</P>
<P>
 So, after two years of canvassing residents, council members tonight will vote 
on revisions to the "goals and policies" segment of the General Plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the changes emphasize preserving the environment by maintaining 
wilderness trails, creating an open-space ring around the city and preserving 
the rugged ridgelines. Another policy change calls for developing attractive 
gateways at the main entrances to Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 "These aren't new things -- we have been saying them all along -- but when you 
put them in writing, you remind everyone that you really do stand behind them," 
Councilwoman Judy Lazar said. 
</P>
<P>
 The revised General Plan policies also urge protection of land that animals 
cross while traveling from one park to another. That issue generated 
considerable debate earlier this year, when a council majority approved a 
residential development on the Dos Vientos Ranch in Newbury Park, despite 
testimony that the project would destroy a key wildlife corridor. 
</P>
<P>
 Other policies urge preservation of the equestrian ranches that "protect the 
city's semirural character," encouragement of light industry along Thousand 
Oaks Boulevard, and development of a mass-transit system. 
</P>
<P>
 The council will discuss the General Plan policies at a public hearing at 7:30 
p.m. A committee is working on updating the entire document and adding new 
sections dealing with air quality and business. STEPHANIE SIMON

 Thousand Oaks families earning up to $57,900 a year can take advantage of an 
expanded Ownership Assistance Program to purchase condominiums and townhomes 
with the help of low interest city loans. 
</P>
<P>
 In Newbury Park's Las Casitas neighborhood, where two-bedroom condominiums 
sell for $60,000 to $80,000 apiece, the city will offer loans totaling up to 
10% of the home's value.Low- and moderate-income families can purchase the 
condos with no down payment, if they qualify for federally insured mortgages. 
</P>
<P>
 Already, six families have purchased condos in Las Casitas with the city's 
help. 
</P>
<P>
 In The Groves complex off Hampshire Road, low-income families earning up to 
$46,320 a year can get the same deal: city loans and no down payment. 
Moderate-income buyers must be able to make a 3% cash down payment on the 
townhomes, which sell for $128,000 to $165,000. 
</P>
<P>
 All the city's ownership assistance loans are available only to first-time 
home buyers. 
</P>
<P>
 For the next 15 weeks, the program will be restricted to people who live or 
work in Thousand Oaks, or who have close relatives in the city. After Jan. 1, 
the city will open its loans to any qualified family. STEPHANIE SIMON

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; APARTMENT-OFFICE PROPOSAL IS SHELVED

<P>
 A 6-year-old proposal that would have allowed apartments to be built above 
offices in central Simi Valley was shelved indefinitely by the City Council 
late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members said they backed away from the plan for the so-called 
mixed-use zoning after residents insisted that it would increase crime and 
create slums. 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds of residents signed petitions opposing the idea, and even the initial 
supporters of the zoning asked the council for added time to make revisions. 
</P>
<P>
 The council was considering mixed-use zoning because the city's General Plan 
recommended it to increase affordable housing in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters of the concept said young people and seniors living in mixed-use 
buildings could abandon their cars and walk to work or to shops. Developers 
could charge less for apartments because revenue from commercial tenants would 
help support building costs. 
</P>
<P>
 And, supporters said the new type of zoning would halt the city's sprawl into 
environmentally sensitive open space by returning residents to the city's 
center. The apartments could have been built on Tapo Street near Alamo Street. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of a city committee that helped formulate the mixed-use plan said they 
would use the added time to revise the idea and try again to sell it to area 
residents. MATTHEW MOSK

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; MAN, 45, IS SENTENCED IN ABDUCTION 
CASE

<P>
 A 45-year-old ironworker was sentenced Monday to eight years in prison for 
abducting his former girlfriend outside her Thousand Oaks church, handcuffing 
her inside his car and holding her at gunpoint for 90 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am convinced that he is obsessed with her and continues to be obsessed with 
her," said Superior Court Judge Allan L. Steele before handing down the 
sentence to Thomas Robles of Downey. 
</P>
<P>
 Keely Okada, the victim, told the judge she feared her former boyfriend would 
seriously harm her if not sent to prison for a long time. "Tom is capable of 
much worse than you have seen here," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Maeve Fox said the crime was premeditated. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mr. Robles planned this thing to a T," she told Steele. "He had handcuffs. He 
had a weapon. . . . He was lying in wait." 
</P>
<P>
 Okada has testified that Robles forced her into his car as she left church 
near Sandberg Street and Keats Avenue on Dec. 17. She said he put a hand over 
her mouth because she was screaming. Once in Robles' car, Okada was handcuffed 
to the front seat as he drove around Thousand Oaks and Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, Okada said she and Robles had had a relationship that started when 
he was married. She said she broke off the affair when she learned he was 
married, but they reunited several months later when he and his wife began 
divorce proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
 Okada said that she and Robles eventually purchased a house together, but she 
broke off their relationship again because Robles was using drugs. The judge 
also ordered drug treatment for Robles in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Robles has past convictions for violating restraining orders against visiting 
his ex-wife and Okada, court records show. DWAYNE BRAY

 A longtime Santa Paula schoolteacher, who said she was forced to resign last 
year after a disciplinary incident with a student, is accusing school officials 
of age discrimination in a lawsuit filed Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Norma Paillette, 64, asserts it was her age, not just the unsubstantiated 
claim of a student, that prompted officials at Isbell School to demote her to 
yard duty supervisor and demand her resignation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Younger employees accused of similar or worse conduct . . . were not punished 
by defendant Santa Paula Elementary School District by being assigned 
professionally degrading work in order to coerce their resignation," attorney 
Edward J. Lacey argued in the lawsuit filed in Ventura County Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
 Paillette, a teacher in Santa Paula since 1964, is seeking at least $25,000 in 
damages to make up for lost wages, reduced retirement benefits and emotional 
distress. School district officials had not seen the lawsuit Monday and 
declined comment. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the suit, the problem arose in May, 1993, when a student accused 
Paillette of inflicting a minor injury. After learning of the student's 
allegations, Principal Arvid Brommers told Paillette, "Norma, you are 63 years 
old, you have 184 days of leave accumulated, and I want you out of here," the 
suit contends. 
</P>
<P>
 When Paillette refused to resign, the suit contends, Brommers placed her on 
five days of administrative leave and made her a yard duty supervisor, 
classroom aide and substitute teacher. She resigned a short time later. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was the oldest teacher in the school," Lacey said. "From our point of 
view, the most telling aspect of this is that he mentioned her age." 
</P>
<P>
 Brommers declined to discuss the incident that led to Paillette's 
reassignment. Lacey said it involved the teacher's efforts to control a student 
and contends that the student overstated the case. PHYLLIS W. JORDAN

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; TRUCK SPILLS SEWAGE; DRIVER, 30, INJURED 
</P>

 A sewage-truck driver swerving to avoid a coyote suffered serious injuries 
when his vehicle overturned early Monday on the Santa Paula Freeway east of 
Ventura, spilling gallons of raw sewage onto the road, the California Highway 
Patrol said. 
</P>
<P>
 Frank Delgadillo, 30, lost control of his two-ton truck when trying to avoid a 
coyote about 3:55 a.m. on the eastbound California 126 east of Wells Road, CHP 
Officer Brian DeMattia said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oxnard man was driving an estimated 60 m.p.h. when his truck, which holds 
about 500 gallons of sewage, swerved to the right and hit the asphalt berm. 
</P>
<P>
 As he tried to regain control, the waste in the truck's tank shifted, causing 
the vehicle to overturn, DeMattia said. The truck slid across the eastbound 
lanes and the oleander-lined dirt divider before coming to a rest on the 
oppositetraffic lanes. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it had been during rush hour, it might have been bad," the officer added. 
</P>
<P>
 While on its side in the westbound lanes, the truck leaked about 200 gallons 
of sewage onto the freeway, J&W Enterprises supervisor Brent Benado said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the Ventura firm, whose vehicles empty portable toilets at 
construction sites, sent a second tanker to the scene and used water to wash 
the sewage off the road. 
</P>
<P>
 Delgadillo, who Benado said has been working for the firm for more than a 
year, was taken to Ventura County Medical Center, where a spokeswoman said he 
was in serious condition with a head laceration and rib fractures. 
</P>
<P>
 DeMattia did not know if Delgadillo had been wearing a seat belt. GREG RIPPEE

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: COUNCIL OKS 700 NEW HOMES, CEMETERY 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A plan to build 700 dwellings, a cemetery and a public park on the Douglas 
Ranch in east Simi Valley was approved unanimously Monday by the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 The cemetery will cover 162 acres of a 381-acre site north of the Simi Valley 
Freeway between Yosemite Avenue and Kuehner Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 Other areas of the parcel will be divided between park and open space areas, 
houses, and moderate- to high-density apartments. 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley council members tinkered with the number of units being proposed 
for a corner of the parcel that faced the freeway, settling on a higher-density 
project. Otherwise, they left the development blueprints unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
 The site is one of only two remaining areas in the city earmarked for a 
cemetery. An undeveloped parcel near Madera Road is also set aside for a 
cemetery, city officials said. MATTHEW MOSK

POLICE RECOVER PROPERTY, TRUCK, CREDIT CARDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It started Monday morning with a single allegation of a young man using a 
stolen credit card at an Oxnard outlet store. 
</P>
<P>
 By evening, Oxnard police said they had arrested four men, found a stolen 
pickup truck and recovered about $500 worth of clothing and tools believed to 
have been bought with purloined cards. 
</P>
<P>
 The first tip came when the Gap outlet store in Oxnard confiscated what they 
believed was a stolen credit card. Police arrived on the scene and arrested 
Alan Kenneth Lisle, 21, on suspicion of using the card, according to a police 
report. 
</P>
<P>
 Officers learned that other suspects had fled the scene in a light blue Isuzu 
pickup truck, earlier reported stolen. Police tracked the truck to Rio Mesa 
High School and arrested 18-year-old Paul Fenlon of Oxnard on suspicion of auto 
theft, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, police arrested 20-year-old twin brothers Jaime and Michael Nava of 
Oxnard on suspicion of a variety of charges, including concealing stolen 
property and carrying a loaded firearm in a vehicle. In the process, police 
said they recovered goods from the Gap, HomeBase and other stores, all believed 
to have been purchased with stolen cards.

SIMI HATE-CRIME VICTIM IS BAFFLED BY SERIES OF ATTACKS; VANDALISM: IN AN EFFORT 
TO STOP THE ANTI-SEMITIC INCIDENTS, TOM MOUZIS PUTS UP SIGN SAYING HE ISN'T 
JEWISH. A NEIGHBOR TAKES OFFENSE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was a case of bigotry and mistaken identity -- a huge swastika and the word 
"JEW" etched over the weekend on Tom Mouzis' lawn in Simi Valley. The incident 
was the third since July where someone had killed the TV producer's grass by 
pouring gasoline onto it in the shape of anti-Semitic and hate symbols, he said 
Monday. He was at wit's end. 
</P>
<P>
 The attacks baffled Mouzis because he is not Jewish. 
</P>
<P>
 And they pushed him to do something Saturday night that he now regrets -- 
tacking a 3-by-5-foot sign to his garage door that proclaimed, "PLEASE STOP! WE 
ARE NOT JEWISH." 
</P>
<P>
 A Jewish neighbor took the message as a slap, and police asked Mouzis early 
Sunday to take down the poster. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had offended a Jewish person in the neighborhood who drove by Sunday and 
saw the sign and thought I was slamming the Jewish faith, which I'm not," said 
Mouzis, 37. "I don't want to see Jews targeted, I just want it to stop." 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley's patrol division is investigating the vandalism, but has no 
leads, detective Sgt. Andrew McCluskey said Monday. The department's detective 
division is expected to decide today whether to take the case, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 There have been no reports of anti-Semitic graffiti in Simi Valley during the 
last three years, said Rabbi Michele Paskow, head of Congregation B'nai Emet, 
the city's only synagogue. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But Jewish children sometimes complain that others call them names at school, 
and such behavior is never acceptable, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm really disappointed to hear that that happened," Paskow said. "Whether 
you're Jewish or not, it's not the point. This is unacceptable behavior." 
</P>
<P>
 She said she understood how Mouzis' fear drove him to post the sign, but she 
added: "I can understand why the Jewish people would be offended." 
</P>
<P>
 The attacks also have angered some of Mouzis' neighbors. They said vandals 
have thrown eggs at their homes and toilet paper in their trees, but the three 
attacks on Mouzis' home were the first incidents of bigotry along quiet, 
tree-lined Mayfair Street. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whether they're Jewish or not, I think it's really unfortunate somebody would 
do that," said neighbor Sharon Ross, who said she moved from Canoga Park to 
escape crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Rita Williams, who lives across the street, said, "The smell of gasoline in 
the middle of the night would set your nerves on edge. Up until this time, this 
has just been this little pocket of paradise."  
</P>
<P>
 Mouzis said he has already installed a 150-watt floodlight and plans to 
install two motion-triggered lights to thwart another incident. 
</P>
<P>
 The first one, on July 4, was kind of puzzling, he said. Someone poured 
gasoline onto the grassy slope by his house in the shape of a circled letter A, 
a symbol for anarchy sometimes used by white supremacists. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kids," he figured, and let it go.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Then on Sept. 15 he awoke to find another circled A on the slope and a 
swastika scrawled in dead grass on the parkway between his sidewalk and the 
street. Mouzis said he reported it to police. 
</P>
<P>
 At least once since then, his bedroom windows were bombarded with eggs, and 
trees in his front yard were festooned with toilet paper. And someone carved a 
swastika and an obscenity into a dirt circle where he planned to plant a tree, 
Mouzis said. 
</P>
<P>
 Then on Friday night, he and his wife tried staying awake to catch someone in 
the act, because previous attacks had come on Friday nights. 
</P>
<P>
 When she heard someone outside, Shelley Mouzis, 37, said she shined a 
flashlight through the window, illuminating a shadowy figure in the fog. When 
the figure ran down the street, Tom Mouzis bolted from the house after him, but 
could not find him, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The next morning, the couple discovered an eight-foot-wide swastika etched 
into the slope, along with the word "JEW" in foot-high letters. 
</P>
<P>
 Struggling for a reason for the attacks, Mouzis said, he remembered that the 
family who sold them the house last December was Jewish. But the attacks did 
not begin until July -- when the Mouzises had already lived there for seven 
months. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm starting to get a real feeling for what other races and religions had to 
go through in history," Mouzis said. "You don't get the full feeling for what 
they've gone through until you go through it yourself." 
</P>
<P>
 He added: "I didn't take it personally because I'm not Jewish, but if I were 
Jewish, I'd be very scared."

THOUSAND OAKS TO CONSIDER PUBLIC SCRUTINY OF LAND SALES; APPRAISALS: 
COUNCILWOMAN JAIME ZUKOWSKI SAYS THE PROCESS NEEDS BETTER MONITORING. AN 
OPPONENT CALLS IT 'OVERKILL.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHANIE SIMON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For a dry, rather technical issue, it's generated quite a philosophical 
debate. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks council members tonight will consider new guidelines for 
handling city-owned land. But their discussion will touch on a much broader 
question: when does citizen input help, and when does it hinder? 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Jaime Zukowski has proposed asking residents to get involved in 
the arcane appraisal business, by screening the professionals who size up the 
value of city-owned property. By appointing taxpayers to monitor the 
appraisals, she said, the city will ensure that the land valuations are 
conducted openly and honestly. 
</P>
<P>
 Her political foes beg to differ. 
</P>
<P>
 Trusting city staff to oversee the land transactions, they argue that a 
citizens task force would only gum up the process of selling surplus property. 
Residents might not understand the real estate business, and training them 
would take time and money. 
</P>
<P>
 "I see it, frankly, as a huge case of overkill and over-expenditure," 
Councilwoman Judy Lazar said. "We can board and commission ourselves to death. 
If we have good staff, their business is to select honest, qualified 
appraisers." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The dispute echoes last week's controversy about the city budget. Councilwoman 
Elois Zeanah suggested forming a citizens task force to check Thousand Oaks' 
books. 
</P>
<P>
 But since the city already hires a professional auditor to scrutinize the 
budget, Councilman Frank Schillo dismissed the proposed community task force as 
redundant. And he said he resented the suggestion that city staff needs 
supervision from a group of lay people. 
</P>
<P>
 Schillo repeated those objections in a new context on Monday, as he rejected 
Zukowski's call for a community panel to review land transactions. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hate the insinuation that our staff has done something wrong," Schillo 
said. "If she thinks they have done something wrong, I'd like to see the 
proof." 
</P>
<P>
 Schillo also opposed Zukowski's suggestion that citizens evaluate the 
credentials of appraisers, draw up a list of the best qualified and require 
city staff to rotate jobs among the professionals, 
</P>
<P>
 Such frequent switches could become disruptive, Schillo said, as no appraiser 
would have a chance to perfect the specialty of evaluating city-owned property. 
"Wasting all that experience doesn't make sense," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks has no formal guidelines on handling the 555 parcels of 
city-owned land. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of those parcels are simply slivers of pavement acquired for widening 
streets or building sidewalks.

SIMI VALLEY CITY COUNCIL VOTES 4-1 FOR 12% RAISE; SALARIES: EACH MEMBER WILL 
RECEIVE $739 A MONTH, A $79 INCREASE, PLUS A 12% BOOST FOR EXPENSES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Citing job demands and the increased cost of living, Simi Valley City Council 
members voted unanimously Monday night to grant themselves a 12% pay raise, the 
first such hike in four years. 
</P>
<P>
 The $79-a-month raise means each council member will begin receiving $739 a 
month in mid-November -- just shy of the maximum state law allows for a city of 
Simi Valley's size. 
</P>
<P>
 The council approved the pay raise with Councilwoman Judy Mikels casting the 
lone dissenting vote. "I don't think government needs raises right now," said 
Mikels, who is abandoning her council seat to run for county supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the vote, taxpayer advocates said they objected to the pay raise, 
calling it inappropriate at a time when local governments are cutting services 
because of belt tightening. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is definitely not the time for local officials to be raising their 
compensation," said Mike Saliba, executive director of the Ventura County 
Taxpayers Assn. "It's a time when most people have to deal with increased fees 
and decreased services, and elected officials should be sensitive to that." 
</P>
<P>
 But Simi Valley Mayor Greg Stratton called the raise a "matter of fairness." 
</P>
<P>
 "Not everyone is Michael Huffington or Dianne Feinstein or (Los Angeles) Mayor 
Riordan," he said of the millionaire politicians. "We struggle to put in long 
hours of service, and we, like anyone else, deserve to be compensated." 
</P>
<P>
 Three council members supported Stratton's reasoning, calling the $79 monthly 
raise a small price to pay for their service. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I look at this issue, the first thing I ask is whether the constituents 
think that the council has done a good job for them," Councilwoman Barbara 
Williamson said. "And I can tell you, I haven't gotten any complaints." 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Bill Davis, who is retired and said he devotes 40 to 60 hours a 
week to his post, said his friends were shocked when they learned he was paid 
less than $8,000 a year for his services. 
</P>
<P>
 "They thought I was crazy, that I should be making $50,000," he said. "This is 
basically a full-time job." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the increase in base pay, council members will receive a 12% 
increase for expenses, a boost that nearly keeps pace with the rising cost of 
living of the last four years, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The council approved the salary increase now -- rather than after the Nov. 8 
election -- because any raise a council grants itself does not go into effect 
until after the next council election. 
</P>
<P>
 Williamson, Davis and Stratton voted themselves a pay raise, since they will 
all retain their seats. Councilwoman Sandi Webb is seeking reelection this 
fall.  
</P>
<P>
 Some residents said they were offended that council members would issue 
themselves a raise, since the city is still feeling the effect of the 
recession. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know of anyone in Simi Valley who is getting that kind of raise right 
now with the way the economy has been," said Steve Frank, a conservative 
Republican activist. "I understand that we're not talking about a lot of money. 
But as a symbolic gesture, they should understand what other people go through 
and not be greedy." 
</P>
<P>
 But council members said they believed the Simi Valley budget is on track, and 
this decision would have no impact on city services. 
</P>
<P>
 The council would not have approved the raise had other city workers not 
received their own increases, members said. In 1992 the council voted to forgo 
an increase because city employees received no raise that year. 
</P>
<P>
 With the raise, compensation for the Simi Valley council will come closer to 
the Thousand Oaks council's, where members earn $765 compared to the new Simi 
Valley wage of $739. Both cities provide council members with health benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think any of us do this job for the money," Stratton said. "But I 
think it would be unfair to ask us to devote this much time and not pay us. And 
I think most anyone in Simi Valley would agree with that."

 Those who have been waiting for an upturn of the economy in Ventura County may 
have a long wait. As other states have been fishing in our industrial waters, 
luring county businesses away with incentives, our elected officials have been 
driving a stake into the heart of those very same businesses.

<P>
 Now, the Board of Supervisors has adopted a traffic mitigation fee that will 
impose more cost on any firm building in the county. What can the supervisors 
be thinking of? When business leaves, who will provide the jobs and the tax 
base necessary to operate county government? 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisors must understand that raising taxes (or fees) does not result in 
increased revenue. Those who are expected to pay those taxes and fees will 
simply go elsewhere, where they are welcomed with open arms. Following the 
board's decision, one industrial firm canceled plans to build a 
30,000-square-foot building. The county's traffic fee would cost $113,400 in 
addition to the city's traffic fee of $28,320 for a total of $141,700. What 
businessman in his right mind would pay $141,700 for traffic mitigation just to 
stay in Ventura County?

 Re: The Oaks mall officials reported vultures roosting there for "several 
months" ("It's a Jungle at the Mall," Sept. 17). Wrong. The vultures have been 
roosting at the mall for at least three years. 
</P>
<P>
 I saw the first vulture six years ago in an empty lot on Marin Street between 
the old library and General Motors during the drought. More soon appeared 
during subsequent drought years and they stayed in eucalyptus trees in the Lynn 
Ranch area. Then they moved to The Oaks mall, where we see then almost daily. 
</P>
<P>
 The turkey vulture ranges from southern Canada to southern South America. The 
largest North American vulture is the California condor, on which millions of 
dollars have been spent to save them from extinction. While superficially 
similar to other birds of prey, the vultures are more closely related 
anatomically and behaviorally to storks.  
</P>
<P>
 A town in Ohio is famous for their vultures and has a yearly celebration 
bringing tourists and money into the area. The Oaks and the Chamber of Commerce 
could easily capitalize on their presence by fencing around the vulture trees 
and using their presence in the same way. Having watched their beautiful, 
graceful, soaring flight above the Lynn Road-Hillcrest intersection for years, 
we would miss them if they left or were endangered in any way. 
</P>
<P>
 And lest anyone laugh at the notion, wouldn't you rather have our city noted 
for its vultures than for the human vermin that preys on us day and night?

FRAGILE ECONOMY

<P>
 I am an operator of a business in Ventura as well as a voter, and I am 
extremely concerned about the possible closure of Point Mugu and Port Hueneme 
military bases in Ventura County due to the Base Realignment and Closure 
(BRAC-95) process enacted by Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 The economy here is very fragile and definitely cannot stand to lose the 
revenue and jobs associated with these possible closures. Many businesses here 
in the city of Ventura barely break even now. A major loss of business to the 
area could be catastrophic for a lot of them.

MILITARY PAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Having left the Army this year to return to the civilian job market, I found 
your article on the "poverty" of some military families inspiring very little 
sympathy. Even worse, I found Rep. Elton Gallegly's proposed bill to spend 
$750,000 to study this "problem" outrageous. 
</P>
<P>
 Assuming that it is the same at Point Mugu as it was at Fort Bragg, the sailor 
profiled in your article pays neither rent nor utilities other than phone 
service while he lives in on-post housing. Also, he draws over $200 a month in 
separate rations to pay for his individual food expenses in addition to his 
base pay of $1,300 a month. All of this is on top of 30 days of paid vacation 
each year and health and dental benefits for him and his family. This sailor 
makes the equivalent of at least $25,000 a year with better benefits than most 
civilian workers. 
</P>
<P>
 The military provides job security, a steady and fair paycheck, and a good 
retirement. It is not responsible for the financial hardship of members who 
decide to live beyond their means.  
</P>
<P>
 Congressman Gallegly should save all Americans a lot of money and tell any 
military personnel who are unhappy with their pay to compare it to their 
civilian options. I'll bet $750,000 they find their current pay more than fair.

SAVING WILD SPACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Your Sept. 9 story about two horseback riders confronting two mountain lions 
at Happy Camp Canyon Regional Park was wonderful. I can only imagine the 
combined feelings of exhilaration and fear the riders felt when the encounter 
occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 The closest I can come is an incident about 28 years ago in the Sespe 
backcountry when I spooked a lion while approaching a fishing hole only to find 
he hadn't vacated the area but was just across the stream eyeballing me from 
over a big rock. At the time, that 25 feet from a mountain lion in the middle 
of nowhere did cause me concern. However, the privilege to have looked this 
wild being in the eye is one I would not trade. Since, I've seen bear, deer, 
cows and rattlesnakes (we leave them alone) in the Sespe watershed. 
</P>
<P>
 The question your story raised is: Should we, as Ventura County residents, 
preserve wild space? 
</P>
<P>
 The encroachment on wild places comes from development for urbanites -- our 
homes, ranches, horses, golf courses and water resources, from oil development 
and range land for cattle. It also comes from our desire to kill off any wild 
thing that threatens us. Does any human animal have the right to call down the 
human authority to kill wild beings because their sheltered environment kept 
them ignorant of the biological diversity around them? Or because wild beings 
would inhibit them from making as much money as they can off the land? 
</P>
<P>
 The riders you wrote about were, for a moment, wild. They ventured into wild 
animal space. They, without knowing it, reacted with wild instincts they may 
never have known they had; instincts that were as natural to their forebears as 
driving skills are to them. 
</P>
<P>
 They lived, in a blink, outside the confines where most of us are imprisoned 
for most of our lives. We must ensure that for all of our children in Ventura 
County -- where they too might have the privilege to one day look a mountain 
lion in the eye.

 Attending nearly every council meeting in my city, on numerous occasions

FLOOD RESPONSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 News stories on the flooding of the Baldwin Co.'s property at Ormond Beach 
have neglected to clarify the cause of the dilemma. 
</P>
<P>
 The flood of Ormond Beach is being caused by artificial means and is reaching 
dangerous proportions. 
</P>
<P>
 Because Port Hueneme property owners are under threat of flooding from the 
city's Bubbling Springs, the Ventura County Flood Control District is diverting 
water from that storm drain to Oxnard's J Street canal. From there, the water 
is traveling to the Oxnard Industrial drain. The confluence of these three 
storm drains is seriously threatening to flood Halaco Engineering's aluminum 
recycling facility and has flooded the Baldwin Co.'s property at Ormond Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 We cannot fault the county for wanting to protect the property of the 
residents of Port Hueneme. We would, however, like for our neighbors throughout 
Ventura County to understand that we are pumping water from our property to 
protect it in the manner any other property owner would. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the way we are portrayed in the media, we at the Baldwin Co. respect 
and appreciate the endangered and populous birds and wildlife in the area and 
the laws that protect them. That is why we did not go in there with bulldozers 
and erect dams to save our property. Instead, we chose to simply pump the water 
back into a County Flood Control canal after deciding pumping was the least 
obtrusive means of defense. 
</P>
<P>
 We urge the Ventura County Flood Control District to continue its efforts with 
the state and federal agencies to alleviate this problem immediately. The 
deluge of water from Port Hueneme and Oxnard has to go somewhere. It only makes 
sense to reduce these flood waters through the available means rather than to 
have them continue to threaten and damage an increasing amount of private 
property.

SUBDIVISION PLANS TO BE STUDIED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Calabasas City Council and Planning Commission will hold a joint session 
Wednesday to study revised plans for a subdivision by a developer who once 
successfully blocked Calabasas' effort to incorporate. 
</P>
<P>
 The hearing is at 7:30 p.m. at City Hall.City officials said the project, 
called Calabasas Oaks, could go before the Planning Commission by the end of 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a public hearing," said Anna-Lisa Hernandez, the city's associate 
planner, who is handling the project. "It's a study session. It's strictly to 
teach." 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed 1,200-plus-acre project includes 550 homes at the end of Parkway 
Calabasas. There would also be a church site and 200,000 square feet of retail 
space off Las Virgenes Road. As part of the proposal, the developer has deeded 
640 acres to the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy to be preserved as open 
space. 
</P>
<P>
 The applicant, Baldwin Cos.-Village Properties, wants to redesign the site 
plan to reduce the amount of grading by 400,000 cubic yards of soil, according 
to Hernandez. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County approved an entitlement to grade about 15 million cubic 
yards before Calabasas became a city in 1991. Also, the applicant, who obtained 
permission to remove 1,800 oak trees, Hernandez said, now proposes removing 
1,400. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials from Baldwin Properties could not be reached for comment Monday. The 
developer, Jim Baldwin, originally wanted to build 1,487 homes, but ran into 
fierce opposition from area residents, who were represented by the Calabasas 
Park Homeowners Assn. Baldwin, saying he does not want to be subject to the 
whims of a future City Council and laws that had not yet been determined, 
sought in 1988 to prevent his project from being included in the area of the 
proposed city.

PRO FOOTBALL DAILY REPORT; RAMS; THIS OLD SHOE DIDN'T BOTHER LANDETA 
</P>

<P>
 Punter Sean Landeta opened his equipment bag at Arrowhead Stadium Sunday and 
discovered he had packed three left shoes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had one right one that was a practice shoe, definitely nasty looking with 
holes and threads dangling down," Landeta said. "I wore my street gym shoes to 
kick in pregame warm-ups so I didn't get my feet wet. I was afraid my socks 
would get soaking wet. I borrowed scissors from the trainer before the kickoff 
to cut the threads off and look presentable." 
</P>
<P>
 Landeta not only looked good, but worked his way into the record books after 
averaging 52.5 yards a punt on four kicks. 
</P>
<P>
 Landeta, who purchased 10 pairs of shoes for $90 as a sophomore at Towson 
State in 1980, tied Parker Hall (1939) and Danny Villanueva (1962) for the top 
single-game average in Ram history. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have two pairs left," said Landeta, who will return to using his regular 
game shoes this week against Atlanta. "I'm not superstitious, so I'll go back 
to my regular game shoes. The practice shoes just have too many holes. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 Landeta said Sunday's performance against the Chiefs was the best of his NFL 
career. He averaged 52.5 yards a punt on six kicks in the 1983 USFL 
championship game for the Philadelphia Stars, and in a three-game stretch in 
1992, he had 17 punts and averaged 51 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Landeta is averaging 46.6 yards a punt this season, which would be a team 
record if it stands up through 16 games. 
</P>

 Coach Chuck Knox said he does not expect offensive tackle Darryl Ashmore 
(knee) to be ready for this week's game, but there's a chance guard Leo Goeas 
(ankle) will be ready.

 Linebacker Roman Phifer, who was a key contributor in the first meeting with 
Atlanta, might miss this one because of a hyperextended elbow.

CAL STATE FULLERTON NOTEBOOK / LON EUBANKS: HAWKING ISN'T FIRST INTERIM COACH 
TRYING TO KEEP SPOT ON TITAN BENCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LON EUBANKS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A basketball coach leaves with the season just around the corner, and the 
university decides that its best move is to turn over the job to a top 
assistant on an interim basis. 
</P>
<P>
 It's the logical move. Above all else, it buys time. 
</P>
<P>
 It happened that way last week at Cal State Fullerton. Brad Holland left for 
what he believes are the greener pastures of the University of San Diego, and 
his assistant Bob Hawking suddenly found himself in charge of the program for 
the upcoming season. 
</P>
<P>
 It happened the same way in 1988 at Fullerton, too. That's how John Sneed 
replaced George McQuarn. 
</P>
<P>
 In Sneed's first season, the Titans won five of six games in overtime, played 
a crowd-pleasing style of basketball, thanks in no small measure to Cedric 
Ceballos, and finished with a surprising 16-13 record. Sneed wound up getting 
the job on a permanent basis. Permanent, that is, for three more years. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately for Sneed, the Titans didn't do that well again in his four 
seasons as coach. Ceballos was back again the following season, and his season 
was even better individually, but this time the Titans lost three of four 
overtime games and the record was reversed at 13-16. Two mediocre seasons 
later, Sneed was gone. 
</P>
<P>
 Hawking's version of the story is still to be written, but his interim status 
will provide an interesting undercurrent all season. 
</P>
<P>
 Hawking said he's committed to going all-out to win the job. "We're going to 
be approaching this as though I'm going to be around here through 2015," 
Hawking said. 
</P>
<P>
 That likely will depend on the team's success. 
</P>
<P>
 Regardless, it will give new Athletic Director John Easterbrook a fair 
opportunity to judge Hawking over the course of a full season, rather than be 
expected to do it in a matter of days. And Hawking will have a chance to show 
what he can concoct from a cupboard he readily acknowledges "is not bare" and 
with players he primarily has been responsible for recruiting over the last two 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Three players who started at various times will be back from the team that was 
8-19, 6-12 in the Big West Conference. The chief losses will be Greg Vernon, 
the lone senior from last year, and Darren Little, who was dismissed from the 
university because of academic problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Winston Peterson, a 6-foot-6 senior, is the top returning player. He averaged 
15.3 points and shot .537 from the field, scoring a season-high 26 points 
against UC Irvine. Senior guard James French started all 27 games last season 
and averaged 9.1 points. Junior forward David Frigout started 18 games, 
averaging 5.3 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Hawking is hopeful some new players will help the situation. That group 
includes three community college transfers: 6-7 forward David Harrison, 5-9 
point guard Ali Nayab and 6-3 guard Chuck Overton. 
</P>
<P>
 Hawking will begin his new job with the enthusiasm of someone who has never 
been a head coach at the college level.  
</P>
<P>
 That sort of enthusiasm will be in his favor at Fullerton, where the 
basketball budget has been cut each of the last two years because of the state 
financial crisis and improvements in the gymnasium are still unfunded. 
</P>
<P>
 Several of Holland's comments after accepting the University of San Diego 
position underlined his concerns at Fullerton. He frequently mentioned the 
advantage he saw in being in the West Coast Conference, which he calls "a level 
playing field." He also likes the fact that San Diego is privately funded, as 
are the other WCC schools. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Most of all, Holland likes the potential for stability at the University of 
San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 When he was back in his office at Fullerton late last week, collecting some of 
his personal belongings and preparing for the move to San Diego, he emphasized 
that as the key factor in his decision to change jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know when you're a head coach you take your chances," he said. "I could 
have been around here for seven or eight years, or fired after three or four . 
. . San Diego is a stable environment. The coaches all have long tenures there. 
I have twin daughters who are 12, and I'm interested in stability for them. I 
want that for my family. It's hard to feel stable when your budget is cut for 
two straight years, and by tens of thousands of dollars." 
</P>
<P>
 Holland, who was the last player recruited by John Wooden at UCLA before his 
retirement, said he talked with Wooden about the situation before he made his 
final decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "The thing he told me was to just make sure it was a good situation for my 
family, and I feel it is that," Holland said. 
</P>
<P>
 Titan Notes 
</P>
<P>
 The Jerry Goodwin golf tournament, which benefits the Titan athletic 
department as well as other programs at the university, attracted 194 players 
Monday, up from 105 last year. Among those playing in the event was the 
Dodgers' Tim Wallach, a former Fullerton player. "That's about all I do now is 
play golf," said Wallach, lamenting the major league baseball situation. . . . 
Volleyball player Melissa Blackler sprained an ankle last weekend and is 
questionable for play this week. Stephanie Cargill also remains uncertain 
because of a knee injury. Pine Reed had a good game against Cal State 
Sacramento with 19 kills, but the Titans remained winless over the weekend and 
fell to 0-12 for the season. . . . The Titan cross-country teams will compete 
Saturday in the Stanford Invitational after the men's and women's teams 
finished second in a triangular meet Saturday at Westmont College. Westmont won 
both divisions, with Fullerton second and UC Santa Barbara third. The Titans' 
Heather Killeen, who missed the 1993 season because of a hip injury, won the 
women's division in 17:14.9. Mark Sinderson was Fullerton's highest finisher in 
the men's division at fifth.

UC IRVINE NOTEBOOK / JOHN WEYLER; TEAMMATE'S INJURY PUTS BACKUP GOALTENDER 
DAVIS ON HOT SEAT

<P>
 Tom Davis was busy helping a user get friendly with his computer when he got 
the call. Sound cards and CD-ROMS would have to wait. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis, self-employed computer consultant/UC Irvine biology major/water polo 
goalie, had a new program to consider. The Anteaters' top goalkeeper, Jeremy 
Storton, had a detached retina and Davis would be making his collegiate debut . 
. . against the No. 1 team in the country . . . in four hours. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just excused myself and went home," Davis said. "I had to stop everything I 
was doing and just try to relax, get focused and get ready to play Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt bad for Jeremy, because he and I are good friends and he had paid his 
dues. But at the same time, there's a definite feeling of excitement. I was a 
little overwhelmed, too. It was like there's no way this could be happening." 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine lost, 9-5, but the Anteaters and their rookie goalie weren't 
embarrassed. "We played them pretty close," Davis said. "It was a good game, I 
played well and I felt pretty good about it." 
</P>
<P>
 His baptism under Cardinal fire, however, was just a dip in the pool compared 
to the pressures ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were playing the No. 1 team, I didn't have much time to think about it and 
I guess I convinced myself I had nothing to lose," he said. "There's a lot more 
pressure now, by far. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now, I've played well and people know I'm capable of playing at that level. 
I've actually played better than I thought I would. So now I'm trying to 
maintain consistency while I keep learning and hopefully improving." 
</P>
<P>
 Davis has 54 saves in seven games this year for the seventh-ranked Anteaters. 
A redshirt freshman from La Habra High, he had a couple of advantages when he 
took the plunge into NCAA action -- solid high school coaching and the 
experience of a year of practice with the Anteaters. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I first got here, I knew this was a whole different league," he said. 
"The balls came so much harder and faster, everything moved so much quicker. 
But I had really good goalie coaches in high school. Jim Sprague, who's now 
over at Servite and my high school coach at La Habra, Jeff Hopkins. That 
definitely has helped me." 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Rall, an All-American goalkeeper at Irvine the last two seasons, has been 
working with Davis. Coach Ted Newland is also giving him extra attention. At 
the moment, however, Newland is mostly concerned with keeping his only 
goalkeeper healthy. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's been playing real well, but he's all we've got and that's scary," said 
Newland, in his 29th season at Irvine. "And it's been a long, long time since 
I've been in the cage." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Protectionism: Being the one and only has its disadvantages. Davis is allowed 
to manipulate the computer keyboard, but he has to stay off his skateboard. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't skateboard. I can't ride my bike. I can't play pick-up basketball for 
fear of getting hurt," he said. "I'm the only guy now and we just can't afford 
to risk a sprained ankle or anything. 
</P>
<P>
 "And that reminds me, I've got to go get a flu shot." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Running for fun: The men's cross-country team, on the brink of extinction 
because of budget cuts in 1991, is beginning to flourish again. The Anteaters 
finished second in a season-opening meet hosted by Cal State Fullerton and were 
third in the UCI Invitational Sept. 17. 
</P>
<P>
 And with only one senior on the team, they figure to keep improving. 
</P>
<P>
 "The program was getting the last rites, so it's exciting to see it come back 
like this," Coach Vince O'Boyle said. "We have no scholarships, of course, so 
it's that much more exciting because these guys are here to get an education 
and run. 
</P>
<P>
 "It reminds me of when I was running. A free pair of shoes made us happy. If 
you train hard, the rewards will be self-satisfaction and a good time." 
</P>
<P>
 Anteater Notes 
</P>
<P>
 The men's soccer team is 6-1 after beating UCLA, 4-3, Sunday in Irvine. The 
most impressive aspect of the victory over the No. 2 team in the country? The 
Anteaters won without a goal from P.J. Polowski. The senior forward had assists 
on Irvine's first two goals, however, and has 18 points (seven goals, four 
assists). He's the top scorer in the NCAA Far West region and tied for 17th in 
the nation. "P.J. did a lot of work in that game, though," Coach Derek Lawther 
said. "He was all over the field. We played quite well, but we still have a bit 
to go and the only way to keep people from saying that UCLA was a fluke is to 
keep winning. That's always the answer isn't it? Just keep winning." . . . 
Senior outside hitter Stacy Mitchell, who had 44 kills, 30 digs, five aces and 
five blocks in two matches last week, was named Big West player of the week. 
Freshman setter Meredith Fletcher set a school record for most set assists with 
67 against Nevada Friday night. The Anteaters (2-9) stopped an eight-match 
losing streak in a five-game match against Nevada and then lost to New Mexico 
State Saturday night after winning the first two games.

COMMUNITY COLLEGE NOTEBOOK / STEVE KRESAL: RANCHO SANTIAGO DEFENSE ADJUSTS TO 
NEW STYLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rancho Santiago switched defensive schemes this season and it took a little 
while for the players to adjust. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dons allowed a single-game team high 452 passing yards in a 55-28 loss to 
El Camino Sept. 10. The Warriors had 606 yards total offense. 
</P>
<P>
 But given two weeks to prepare for Palomar, the J.C. Grid-Wire defending 
national champion, Rancho Santiago's new defense, forced six turnovers and the 
Dons went on to a 31-14 upset Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Marcello Royal, a sophomore defensive back, led the way with 11 tackles and 
recovered two fumbles. Andre Holmes also had an interception in the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
 Rancho Santiago's defense is based on the same swarming defense made popular 
by the University of Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm really proud of the effort by the kids and the coaches," Rancho Santiago 
Coach Dave Ogas said. "We were missing a couple of defensive backs and didn't 
have some people in the right places in the first game. But defensive 
coordinator Tom Nelson and his staff of Bennie Rapp, Joe Jacobs and Derrick 
Watkins really worked hard." 
</P>
<P>
 The key offensive play for the Dons came midway in the fourth quarter when 
quarterback Simon Fuentes, ducking a blitz, completed a pass in the flat to 
tight end Chad Flick, who took off for the goal line. He was tackled at the 
Palomar one after the third-down play covered 63 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin Pola scored on the next play and the Dons were ahead, 31-14. 
</P>
<P>
 Fuentes was 18 of 29 for 241 yards and two touchdowns. He attempted only eight 
passes as a reserve freshman, then left with a concussion in the second quarter 
of the El Camino game. 
</P>
<P>
 The loss stopped Palomar's 20-game winning steak. The Comets' last loss also 
came against a team from Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange Coast stunned the Comets, 42-7, Oct. 3, 1992. Palomar won the final 
eight games of that season, went 11-0 last season and was, 1-0, before Rancho 
Santiago won Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Things don't get any easier for the Dons (1-1) on Saturday in their home 
opener. Rancho Santiago plays host to Long Beach (3-0) at 1:30 p.m. at Santa 
Ana Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dons likely will be be without running back Ernie Wilson, who injured his 
knee in the Palomar game. Wilson had 67 yards rushing before being hurt in the 
third quarter. He has rushed for 193 yards and two touchdowns in two games. 
Wilson is also averaging 34 yards in seven kickoff returns. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 One-sided: The early strength of the Mission Conference is clearly with the 
Northern Division. The seven teams have combined for a 11-2-2 record thus far. 
</P>
<P>
 The Central Division, which is made up of the five Orange County teams, 
Riverside and Southwestern, is 2-11-2. 
</P>
<P>
 The Northern Division teams have outscored opponents, 519 to 349, while the 
Central teams have been outscored, 496 to 355. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach (3-0), El Camino (2-0) and Cerritos (2-0) are off to the best 
starts in the Northern Division. 
</P>
<P>
 Riverside and Rancho Santiago have the only victories in the Central Division. 
But things are going to get better. Play within each division starts Oct. 8. 
</P>
<P>
 The Northern Division's strength is also reflected in the weekly Southland 
poll. Bakersfield (3-0) is ranked No. 1, but the following four teams are from 
the division. Long Beach (3-0) is second, El Camino (2-0) third, Cerritos (2-0) 
fourth, Mt. San Antonio (1-0-1) fifth, Los Angeles Valley (3-0) sixth, Chaffey 
(2-0) seventh, Palomar (1-1) eighth, Ventura (3-0) ninth and Riverside (1-1) 
10th. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 This week: South Coast Conference water polo play starts Wednesday, with 
Fullerton at Golden West in a 3:30 p.m. game. Golden West has won five 
consecutive State titles and is ranked second in the state behind Long Beach. 
The Rustlers are 9-1. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton is also having a solid season as well. The Hornets (8-4-2) are 
coming off a 9-6 upset of ninth-ranked San Diego Mesa over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 In women's soccer: Cypress is at Orange Coast in an Orange Empire Conference 
game at 2:30 p.m. today. Besides being two strong programs, there is an added 
note of tension to this game because Cypress (3-0, 1-0) is on a self-imposed 
probation after making first contact with an out-of-district player who is 
playing for Orange Coast (4-1, 2-0). 
</P>
<P>
 Cypress, the two-time defending conference champion, has won 25 consecutive 
conference matches. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Russ Liken, a volunteer shooting coach for the men's basketball team at 
Cypress from 1982 to 1990, died of a heart attack Saturday in Las Vegas at age 
72. 
</P>
<P>
 Liken had been a standout basketball player in the Pittsburgh area and earned 
a scholarship to Temple in 1943 but joined the Navy instead. 
</P>
<P>
 Liken, a retired steelworker, began his involvement with the program after 
walking on the campus one day and looking in on practice.

</P>
<P>
 * Loans or letters of credit that require up-front fees. 
</P>
<P>
 * Methods of obtaining loans or bank notes that are sketchy, or overly 
complex. 
</P>
<P>
 * Transaction involves the use of offshore accounts or financial institutions 
in the Caribbean. 
</P>
<P>
 * Name-dropping, or claims that the investments or loans are arranged or 
somehow backed by large, globally recognized financial institutions or a 
"big-name player." 
</P>
<P>
 * Documentation looks amateurish, contains misspellings or grammatical errors. 
</P>
<P>
 * A bank is not listed or registered with state or federal agencies.

NOTEBOOK; WEEK 3 CONTINUES TO BE UNLUCKY FOR VAQUEROS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN HENDERSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Irvine has won three consecutive Southern Section football titles, but that 
isn't the only pattern the Vaqueros have developed the last few years. In 
addition to winning almost all the time, they lose all the time in Week 3. 
</P>
<P>
 For the fourth consecutive year, Irvine was beaten in the third week of the 
season. It's a small price to pay for a championship in Week 14, though. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't ever want to lose," Vaqueros Coach Terry Henigan said after a 41-6 
victory over Mission Viejo in Week 2. "But sometimes it can be good for you; it 
keeps you from being complacent. And each time we've lost early, we've been 
able to use it as a rallying point for the rest of the year. Still, I hope we 
don't need that 'wake-up' call this season." 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine lost to Anaheim, 20-7, Friday and dropped to 2-1. 
</P>
<P>
 The main reason the Vaqueros -- ranked No. 3 at the time -- lost was Reuben 
Droughns. Droughns rushed 31 times for 278 yards; in his first two games, 
Droughns rushed 41 times for 201 yards. In Irvine's first two games, the 
Vaqueros' defense allowed only 94 yards in 42 attempts. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've faced a lot of good running backs, but I thought he was outstanding," 
said Henigan, who is in his 13th year. "We've been beaten by the best (over the 
years), and he's right in there." 
</P>
<P>
 It won't get any easier for Irvine, who plays No. 2 Mater Dei Thursday at the 
Santa Ana Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've got a bunch of assistants who are mad at me," Henigan said. "We 
scheduled this game late; I gave them a choice back in February, 'We can have a 
bye this week or play Mater Dei.' They voted for 'bye' and I went ahead and 
scheduled Mater Dei. We looked in Arizona, Hawaii, everywhere. And I decided to 
do this, which was stupid." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Woodbridge and University High fans observed a moment of silence Friday night 
for three former Woodbridge athletes killed in a recent automobile accident in 
Arizona. Killed in the accident were Babak Dogmetchi and Arash Ghazinor, who 
played basketball at Woodbridge, and Ryan Lemmon, who played baseball. As a 
tribute, the Woodbridge Associated Student Body announced it will plant three 
trees on the campus next to a memorial plaque.  
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 El Toro sophomore Murle Sango scored his third touchdown of the season Friday, 
but he would gladly give each back if his best friend, Tomas Mejia, could watch 
him play. 
</P>
<P>
 Mejia was one of four Charger cross-country runners seriously injured in an 
automobile accident Aug. 26. Mejia remains in a coma at Western Medical Center 
in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think about him all the time," Sango said. "I'm scoring all my touchdowns 
for him and praying that everything will turn out all right." 
</P>
<P>
 Contributions to help the four families defray medical and rehabilitation 
costs can be made by calling El Toro High at 586-6333.

 As the final seconds ticked off the clock in Santiago's 14-3 victory over 
Buena Park Thursday, Tom Sokanthong knelt and kissed the grass at Buena Park 
High. 
</P>
<P>
 Sokanthong, a senior running back, had been on the field for every one of 
Santiago's 15 consecutive losses over the last three seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 "It felt incredible," said Sokanthong, who led the Cavaliers with 60 yards 
rushing. "I went through every loss, but I knew with the new coach (Ben Haley), 
we'd improve. I love my team." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Katella's safety in its 47-2 loss to Orange Thursday is notable if, for no 
other reason, to ask the question, "Is Jerry Arguello a soccer-style kicker?" 
</P>
<P>
 The trouble started when the ball was snapped over the head of Arguello, the 
Orange punter. He dashed back but slipped. Arguello then decided on another 
course of action: He kicked the ball off the ground but lined it into the 
center of the charging Katella defense. The ball bounced back past Arguello, 
who then kicked it out of the back of his own end zone for a safety. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Kennedy's makeshift one-back offense accounted for 159 yards between its two 
primary rushers, Charlie Marino and Darin Martineau, against Corona del Mar 
Thursday. The bulk of that fell to Marino (33 for 137) because Martineau was 
busy filling in at emergency linebacker. In the first two games, using its 
normal offense with Marino and Martineau sharing the running duties, they 
averaged a combined 111 yards.

 Quotes of the week: 
</P>
<P>
 * "I'm going to see those Monarchs running through my bedroom tonight." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Jim Walsh, Hawthorne line coach, after watching the Monarchs run wild in 
their 52-11 victory Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 * "We had 200 yards in penalties." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Mitch Olson, Kennedy coach, after his team was whistled nine times for 71 
yards in penalties during its 14-8 victory over Corona del Mar Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 * "I might not let him change back." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Trabuco Hills Coach Bill Barnett, after Laquent Fobbs rushed for 50 yards, 
caught 70 passes and scored twice against Villa Park while wearing uniform 
jersey No. 26 instead of his normal No. 17, which was sent out to be repaired. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Our job: Get the ball back!" 
</P>
<P>
 -- Words scribbled on Santa Margarita defensive chalkboard on the sideline. 
The Eagles forced five turnovers in their 17-7 victory over Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Edison Coach Dave White was reduced to sitting in the stands for a half Friday 
at San Clemente. White, who coaches from upstairs using a headset, was going to 
be in the special lift Edison had rented. But the lift didn't show until the 
second quarter. The Chargers beat San Clemente, 14-7, but San Clemente had a 
7-0 first-quarter lead. It was tied at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Three dots and a cloud of dust: Savanna averaged 35.7 points last year. 
Through three games this year, the Rebels are averaging 49, though they 
averaged only 30 last year against the same three opponents, Garden Grove, 
Katella and Cypress. . . . Sonora tight end Mark Gonzalez caught two passes for 
126 yards in his first two games; Friday, he caught nine for 171 in a 28-24 
loss to Garden Grove. . . . Consistency counts at Newport Harbor. The Sailors 
have beaten Orange, 28-10, Ocean View, 28-0, and Foothill, 28-7. . . . The city 
of Whittier has been tough on Bolsa Grande. Whittier La Serna beat the 
Matadors, 35-13, and before that, Whittier Christian pummeled them, 44-0. . . . 
Saddleback's only penalty in its 28-0 victory over Santa Ana was for a kickoff 
that went out of bounds. Coach Jerry Witte said he could not remember the last 
time his team went an entire game without a penalty -- and that's a lot of 
games: 216 in 22 years. . . . Brea-Olinda Coach John Looney directed his team 
to a 28-7 victory over Troy on Friday. Looney's father, H.L. Looney, was the 
principal at Troy during the mid-'70s.

 Anaheim, Junior

 Football/Running back

 Droughns, who rushed for 2,039 yards last season, is showing no signs of 
slowing down. Friday, he rushed for 278 yards and three touchdowns and led the 
Colonists to a 20-7 upset of then-No. 3 Irvine. It was the type of performance 
that doesn't usually happen against Irvine, which has won three consecutive 
section titles."Nothing comes easily against a team like that," Anaheim Coach 
Allen Carter said. "And I think they were kind of waiting for him. He deserved 
every yard he got." Because Droughns slightly sprained his ankle in the last 
minute of the game, Carter said he will be held out of practice early this 
week, but Droughns is expected to play Friday against Cypress.

 Courtney Owens 
</P>
<P>
 Calvary Chapel, Senior 
</P>
<P>
 Volleyball/Outside hitter 
</P>
<P>
 A four-year starter, Owens is Calvary Chapel's most dangerous hitter, but she 
isn't the Eagles' only weapon. Owens had 23 kills in a 13-15, 15-8, 15-13, 
15-10 victory over Bakersfield Centennial in the title game of the Redondo 
tournament.Jenny Roberts had 16 kills and Sara Roberts had 14. But Calvary 
Chapel Coach Jim Downey said Owens is also an outstanding passer and defensive 
player. "She can control the game with her ball control," Downey said. "And she 
had at least 20 digs against Centennial." Owens, who is being recruited by UC 
Santa Barbara, Colorado and the University of San Diego, also had a strong 
performance in the Eagles' four-game victory over Los Alamitos in the 
semifinals.

THE SIMPSON TRIAL; TRIALS AND TRIBULATIONS; COURTS: FOR SOME IN THE LEGAL 
SYSTEM, THE CRUSH OF MEDIA AND CURIOSITY SEEKERS FOR THE O.J. SIMPSON CASE 
NEARLY FORCES THE WHEELS OF JUSTICE TO GRIND TO A HALT.

<P>
 The guy suspected of stealing her car was on trial on the inside. But it was 
Patricia Auger's patience that was being tried outside the Criminal Courts 
building Monday morning in Downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Auger left her Victorville home before dawn to get to court on time to testify 
against the suspect. She even remembered to stop in Fontana to pick up a friend 
to ride in with her, "so we could drive in the car-pool lane and save time." 
</P>
<P>
 Too bad she forgot that O.J. Simpson's trial was beginning on the same day, at 
the same hour, at the same courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
 There was chaos when Auger arrived. A mob of photographers and reporters 
jousting for a glimpse of Simpson's attorneys blocked the door. A crowd of 
curious onlookers formed a tight knot behind them. And in back of them was a 
colorful gaggle of demonstrators trying to attract attention to their own 
causes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Only the O.J. people could go inside," said Auger, 31. "We saw O.J.'s friend, 
the guy with the white streak in his hair -- Mr. (Robert) Kardashian. We tried 
to sneak in through the door behind him, but they stopped us. They finally sent 
us to a door on the far side." 
</P>
<P>
 As it turned out, the courthouse had a "The Far Side" cartoon look to it all 
day.  
</P>
<P>
 On one side of the building, local disc jockey Rick Dees was broadcasting his 
drive-time show live, offering running commentary on the circus-like 
atmosphere. Out front, the real circus was unfolding as Pop Zhao unfurled a 
huge white drop cloth and started painting himself red. 
</P>
<P>
 Zhao, a 31-year-old Chinese performance artist, had driven from San Francisco. 
He was wearing a white jumpsuit and a painted question mark on his face. As he 
dripped paint to the strain of classical music blaring from a boombox, he 
handed out mock dollar bills to bystanders. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson's picture replaced George Washington's portrait. "O.J. Innocent," 
proclaimed the writing over the picture. 
</P>
<P>
 The Simpson attorneys were inside the courthouse by now and reporters quickly 
turned their attention to Zhao. "I asked God about O.J. and God said he's 
innocent, that two other people did it," Zhao told them. 
</P>
<P>
 Suggested Norma Meyer of Copley News Service: "Why don't you go back and ask 
God tonight what their names are and come back tomorrow and tell us?" 
</P>
<P>
 In the background, laughing and taking snapshots was Irene Allen. She runs the 
courthouse shoeshine stand. It's called A.J.'s Shoe Shine Parlor. And O.J.'s 
been very, very good to A.J.'s. 
</P>
<P>
 "Business has tripled since the O.J. thing came here," confided Allen, 50. 
"I've had to buy a $900 electric shoeshine machine to keep up." 
</P>
<P>
 When she's not seeing that the shoes of celebrity lawyers and celebrity news 
correspondents are being polished, Allen is polishing up her own celebrityhood. 
</P>
<P>
 "I also do a live talk show three times a week. An Illinois radio station 
calls up and asks what's going on and I tell them what's happened," she said. 
"They're paying me." 
</P>
<P>
 There was a flurry of activity at noon when jurors were released for lunch. 
Those not called for the Simpson case came outside to look at the show. Several 
purchased $1 buttons from salesman Eddie Dee, 63, of La Canada Flintridge. The 
biggest seller: "O.J. Simpson Jury Reject: did not make the cut." 
</P>
<P>
 One woman wearing a juror's badge berated Dee -- who normally sells buttons at 
sporting events. "Everybody's making money on this except O.J.," she screamed. 
</P>
<P>
 Demonstrator Jack Gerritsen, 58, of Bell, handed brochures demanding jury 
reform to jurors as they walked out. "Thanks for serving," he said, wearing 
sandals with his maroon suit. 
</P>
<P>
 Down the sidewalk, court workers and jurors lined up at Alfredo Uycabaodeci's 
hot dog cart. Fernando Mejia, a cameraman for Channel 52, helped out by making 
change while he waited his turn. 
</P>
<P>
 During the afternoon, as the first of hundreds of potential Simpson jurors 
were being assembled on the 11th floor, jurors in other parts of the courthouse 
idled away the time as they waited to be called to duty for less sensational 
trials. 
</P>
<P>
 Some played cards in the hallway. Others gossiped about the excitement outside 
and their good fortune at not being called for a trial that could last six 
months or longer, as Simpson's might. 
</P>
<P>
 On the 15th floor, jurors in Judge Carlos R. Moreno's courtroom sat placidly 
while a hapless defendant in a drug case tried to defend himself by acting as 
his own attorney.  
</P>
<P>
 Next door, Judge Jan A. Pluim was questioning potential jurors for another 
drug case. When he asked the first six if any had been a victim of crime, hands 
went up and a litany of burglary stories and car-theft and purse-snatching 
tales poured out. 
</P>
<P>
 In an 11th-floor courtroom, a woman stepping out of a jury box tripped, hit 
her head and was knocked out cold. An ambulance was summoned. 
</P>
<P>
 Its siren interrupted TV correspondent Lisa Stark, who was outside the 
courthouse filing a live report for a St. Louis station.  
</P>
<P>
 It was one of 15 such reports she would do this day for local ABC affiliates 
across the country, said Stark, of Washington, D.C. "This is a light day," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Patricia Auger, meantime, was heading back to Victorville after finally 
testifying in her car-theft case. It had been a heavy day for her. 
</P>
<P>
 "It worked out in the end, though," Auger explained. "I was late getting 
there. But the judge was too."

BILL BOYARSKY: THE SIMPSON TRIAL; THE SPIN / BILL BOYARSKY; PATROLLING FOR 
SOUND BITES ON A QUIET DAY

<P>
 On the first day of the O.J. Simpson trial, the world media was like an army 
with nobody to fight. 
</P>
<P>
 The glacial process of jury selection didn't start until Monday afternoon. It 
featured the humdrum excuses of citizens who must pass up the Simpson jury 
because they can't get off work or must care for sick relatives. 
</P>
<P>
 Having been through such questioning as a potential juror, I was glad Superior 
Court Judge Lance A. Ito banned the press from the room, except for three pool 
reporters who will relay the news to their colleagues. Otherwise, I might have 
had to watch. 
</P>
<P>
 Under normal circumstances, the reporters' bosses would have told them to 
forget about filing a story on a day such as this. But with the O.J. case, 
forget the normal. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The army is vast and its equipment is expensive. I've never covered a war, 
unless you count our periodic riots. But I've been assigned to several 
press-heavy national political conventions and even by those standards, the 
Simpson media presence is overwhelming. 
</P>
<P>
 It's easy to understand why the army is here. While most people think the news 
media have behaved irresponsibly in covering the case, according to the Los 
Angeles Times Poll, they can't get enough of those irresponsible words and 
pictures. 
</P>
<P>
 Three out of five of those questioned by the poll said they watch the Simpson 
news closely. That's 60% of the 1,703 Los Angeles County adults interviewed 
last week. 
</P>
<P>
 In other words, people are interested. They read, listen and watch. That's why 
the Simpson media army is on duty. The story brings in readers, listeners, 
viewers and advertisers. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I'm used to being part of a horde of reporters, but this was a real shock to 
one of my readers. She called to complain that the television networks and 
stations are paying the county just $24,000 a month for the use of a parking 
lot across from the Criminal Courts Building, the media army base called Camp 
O.J. 
</P>
<P>
 The lot contains more than 40 satellite trucks and trailers, along with huge 
scaffolding in the air. These support the platform stages for network 
correspondents. The cost of all this to the television industry, plus cables, 
phone lines and other equipment could easily reach into the millions, technical 
consultant Scott Shulman told the Associated Press' Anh Bui. 
</P>
<P>
 My reader said the television operations should pay more than $24,000 a month. 
"How much more?" I asked. "Five hundred thousand a month?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Why not," she replied. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 All through the day, elements of the army fanned out from Camp O.J. and 
subsidiary installations, searching for news that was hard to find. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of them found Linda Deutsch of the Associated Press, one of the pool 
reporters, who was in the press room, on the phone to her office and, at the 
same time, answering a question from her colleague, Michael Fleeman, sitting in 
front of her, writing a story on his computer. 
</P>
<P>
 Microphones and tape recorders were thrust at her. Reporters asked questions 
about what had happened in court. 
</P>
<P>
 The intrusion would disturb some reporters. But the AP is a high pressure 
organization and its staff is trained to be cool in the face of distraction or 
even disaster. Deutsch calmly answered the questions, although she didn't have 
much news. One of the reporters tried the psychological approach, an 
examination of Deutsch herself: How do you feel about what you're doing? 
</P>
<P>
 Deutsch's answer didn't make a great sound bite. "I hope I can provide the 
information everybody wants," she said. But it was worth more than what some of 
the other elements of the media army were picking up. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Outside the courthouse, a man with white makeup and a red cape was being 
interviewed by a television reporter. He was asking the man whether the scene 
outside the courthouse was dignified. 
</P>
<P>
 A print reporter was interviewing a Criminal Courts Building fixture, the man 
who urges all jurors to ignore the judges' instructions and vote their 
conscience. He sees this as a national crusade, but during the preliminary 
hearing, the media tired of him in a few days. With new reporters in town, his 
crusade has revived. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a slow news day at the courthouse, but there was a lesson in it. 
Although there was nothing to do, the army was in place and its commanders felt 
obligated to keep their troops on the move -- an example of how much the 
Simpson case is distorting values in the news business.

A TENUOUS TRUCE; GANG CEASE-FIRE IN VIOLENCE-PLAGUED OAKWOOD KEPT SUMMER 
PEACEFUL; POLICE REMAIN SKEPTICAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT COLLINS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One year after the start of a bloody war between black and Latino gangs, a 
tenuous cease-fire has brought relative calm to the troubled Oakwood 
neighborhood of Venice. 
</P>
<P>
 Social workers are applauding the unofficial truce reached last summer by the 
community's two major gangs, whose feud has claimed at least 17 lives since 
last September. Officials say Oakwood -- a low-income, ethnically diverse 
enclave of quaint bungalows less than a mile from the beach -- has seen no gang 
shootings since mid-June, when the truce took effect. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything's cool, and it's gonna stay that way," said Jimmie Powell, a 
counselor for Project Heavy West, a nonprofit gang diversion program, who was 
wounded in an Oakwood shooting in January during the height of the war. 
</P>
<P>
 Bud Jacobs, principal of Venice High School, said the truce appears to be 
sticking. "You can feel tension if it exists, but for the first two weeks of 
this semester, it's been calm and almost amiable," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Powell and others who work with youths said the gangs have continued talks and 
even plan to deliver a list of suggested community improvements to elected 
officials such as Los Angeles City Councilwoman Ruth Galanter. 
</P>
<P>
 Although some sources have said continued battles over drug-selling turf 
threaten the peace, jittery neighbors are hoping for the best. During the 
darkest days of the gang war, some fearful adults kept their children indoors 
and carried guns for self-protection while on routine errands. The sound of 
nearby automatic weapon fire became commonplace. 
</P>
<P>
 "People just got tired of all the killing," said Raphael Anderson, 34, a 
lifelong resident of Oakwood. "Wherever you walked, you had to look over your 
shoulder. It was like a Bosnian war situation around here." 
</P>
<P>
 Police have taken a more skeptical attitude toward the truce. Lt. John Weaver 
of the Los Angeles Police Department's anti-gang CRASH unit said gang members 
may have called a temporary cease-fire because the violence was leading to 
increased police patrols, which in turn were interfering with drug sales. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the mostly black Shoreline Crips and mostly Latino Venice-13s, or 
V-13s, have steadfastly refused comment, but Brad Carson, a Los Angeles County 
probation officer who helped negotiate the truce, said community pressure and 
sheer fatigue had prompted gang members to seek a brokered cease-fire. 
</P>
<P>
 Gang members "wanted to stop it themselves. They just didn't want to be the 
first ones to make the move," Carson said. "They just had a definite lack of 
communication." 
</P>
<P>
 The war erupted a year ago, after a Latino man affiliated with the V-13s was 
shot by a black assailant, according to Mike Duarte, deputy district attorney 
in Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
 That shooting apparently had nothing to do with gangs. But it served to 
inflame racial tensions in the community, which was once predominantly black 
but is now about half Latino. 
</P>
<P>
 A series of grim, tit-for-tat reprisals ensued. Some of the attacks were 
directed not at rival gang members, residents say, but at bystanders evidently 
targeted because of their race. 
</P>
<P>
 Carson said gang members agreed to meet three days after a highly publicized 
June 10 double murder not far from Oakwood. Two Latino teen-agers, neither of 
whom was believed to be a gang member, were slain in a drive-by attack as they 
sat in a car on Venice Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 Carson said he and another probation officer took leaders of the opposing gang 
factions to a neutral site in South-Central Los Angeles, where they discussed 
their differences. Soon rival gang members could be seen playing baseball 
together in neighborhood parks. 
</P>
<P>
 Social workers also helped arrange meetings between gang leaders and Galanter, 
who later reported that the youths had raised concerns over a lack of jobs, 
dearth of recreational facilities and perceived police hostility in their 
community. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm willing to (pursue) whatever (program) somebody can come up with, if they 
can explain how it will make the situation better and get people jobs," 
Galanter said. 
</P>
<P>
 Many say the fate of the cease-fire ultimately depends on giving youths 
alternatives to gangs. Pearl White, a longtime Oakwood activist who runs a 
drama program aimed at youngsters, sees a window of opportunity in the 
armistice. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we can put positive things before young people, there'll be a turnaround" 
in the gang violence, she predicted. 
</P>
<P>
 "The job is not finished until we see what we can do about the situation that 
caused the problem in the first place," said Bill Martinez, executive director 
of Community Youth Gang Services in Los Angeles. "These young people are really 
behind the eight ball when it comes to getting jobs."

4 ARRESTED IN WEST HOLLYWOOD CARJACKING, RAPE; VIOLENCE: COUPLE OPEN THEIR DOOR 
TO VICTIM AND CALL 911. A QUICK RESPONSE BY DEPUTIES RESULTS IN THE CAPTURE OF 
THE SUSPECTS IN LESS THAN TWO HOURS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 The sound of knocking at doors in the West Hollywood apartment courtyard kept 
coming closer early Monday until the tapping was on their own windows. The 
woman outside said very calmly: "May I come in and use your phone? I've been 
raped." 
</P>
<P>
 Donna Norton and her boyfriend, Tom Space, opened their door and Space dialed 
911. The woman at the door "said she had been dumped in a dead-end alley, and 
she was carrying her sandals and her driver's license," Norton said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The response to the 911 call was almost instantaneous. Sheriff's deputies -- 
already alerted to the crime by an earlier caller -- arrived at the apartment 
while Space was still talking to the 911 operator, and the suspects were 
arrested in less than two hours. 
</P>
<P>
 The crime began when four armed men accosted the 24-year-old woman and her 
date as they sat in a car in the 8300 block of Sunset Boulevard shortly before 
1:30 a.m., deputies said. The men ordered the woman's date out of the 
late-model purple Honda, drove away with her and forced her to commit various 
sexual acts, investigators said. They dumped her near the 9000 block of Rangely 
Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Alerted by the woman's date and an anonymous man who came to his aid, deputies 
immediately dispatched patrol cars to the carjacking scene and put a helicopter 
in the air to search for the Honda, said Deputy Benita Hinojos, a department 
spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
 The helicopter spotted the stolen Honda at Robertson Boulevard and Beverlywood 
Street, three miles from where the woman had been abandoned, Hinojos said. 
Deputies set up a containment perimeter around the area and called in a K-9 
unit, investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the dogs found and bit a suspect in the right arm," said Deputy Irma 
Becerra. The other three surrendered without incident, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities identified the suspects, all from Los Angeles, as Jerwainn Bryant, 
20, Jerry Smith, 22, Derrick Cook, 21, and a 17-year-old boy whose identity was 
not released because he is a juvenile. The three adults were being held in lieu 
of $100,000 bail on suspicion of carjacking, kidnaping and rape, Hinojos said. 
The juvenile was being held without bail at Sylmar Juvenile Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 The man who had been forced from the Honda at gunpoint was taken to the arrest 
scene to identify the suspects. Deputies said they had to restrain him from 
attacking one of the men in custody. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple who assisted the rape victim believe she may have been in shock 
when she arrived at their door after knocking at several neighbors' apartments 
and getting no response. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was very calm," said Norton, an assistant accountant at a restaurant. 
"She was not crying. There were no hysterics. She said the men had held a gun 
to her date's head." 
</P>
<P>
 The woman's abductors told her they needed the car "to get back to the 'hood," 
Norton said. The woman said the men threatened to kill her "if she didn't do 
what they wanted." 
</P>
<P>
 Norton noticed a large bump on the woman's forehead and asked if she was aware 
of it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, my God, that must be where they hit me with the gun," the woman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman was in the apartment only about three minutes before deputies 
arrived, Norton said. She was taken to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center where she 
was treated and released. 
</P>
<P>
 Norton said her boyfriend, Space, a restaurant chef, had taken a cab home from 
work Sunday night and they had been sitting up watching television and reading 
when the woman tapped on their window at about 1:45 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 After helping the rape victim, Space told Norton that the cab driver had 
complimented his neighborhood, saying: "Nothing much ever happens here."

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; LAWYER 
SAYS OFFICER DIDN'T MEAN TO SHOOT AT PATROLMAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An off-duty police officer fired his pistol in frustration after finding out 
he wouldn't get a raise and then had a few drinks, but he didn't mean to shoot 
at a highway patrol officer, his attorney said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Officer Ted Teyechea "did the most painfully stupid thing he had ever done in 
his life" when he leaned out of a pickup truck window and fired his 
9-millimeter automatic service pistol at the ground, attorney Barry Levin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Teyechea and Officer Michael Herrera, both police officers for nine years, are 
charged with assault with a deadly weapon, shooting at an occupied vehicle and 
the negligent discharge of a firearm. They are accused of shooting at 
California Highway Patrol motorcycle Officer Scott Wall during a car chase on 
the Harbor Freeway on Feb. 9. Wall was not hit by any of the 21 shots the 
officers allegedly fired. 
</P>
<P>
 Levin, in an opening statement to the jury, said Teyechea was just blowing off 
steam when he emptied his pistol in the incident. Herrera's attorney also said 
his client admitted firing his gun but did not shoot at Wall.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES COUNTY; 2 
MEN KILLED BY METROLINK TRAINS IN SEPARATE ACCIDENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two men were killed Monday by Metrolink trains in separate accidents, raising 
the number of Los Angeles commuter train deaths to three in the past four days. 
</P>
<P>
 Metrolink officials said it is the first time two people have died in a single 
day since the train service began in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest death was Monday about 5:20 p.m. when a 41-year-old man wearing 
headphones and listening to loud music was struck from behind as he walked on 
the train tracks between Riverdale Drive and Goodwin Avenue on the southeast 
border of Glendale, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The man, whose identity was being withheld until his family was notified, 
lived nearby and often used the railroad tracks as a short cut from his bus 
stop to home, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier in San Fernando, a man in his 30s was killed when he dived into the 
path of a Metrolink commuter train at a rail crossing, authorities said. The 
man's identity also was withheld pending notification of relatives. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday evening, 21-year-old Barry Alfred George of Northridge died after he 
walked into the path of an oncoming Metrolink train in Northridge.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: CULVER CITY; TAGGERS 
CAN LOSE DRIVER'S LICENSES UNDER NEW LAW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Taggers caught in Culver City will face the revocation of their driver's 
licenses, stiff new fines and up to four days of community service under a 
tough anti-graffiti ordinance passed Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The ordinance, approved unanimously by the City Council, is among the most 
stringent in Los Angeles suburbs.City officials said that last year alone, they 
were forced to spend $54,000 in public funds to clean up more than 1,900 
markings. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the new city law, convicted taggers will face suspension of their 
driving privileges. They also could be fined up to $50,000, jailed for up to a 
year and sentenced to perform up to four days of community service. 
Responsibility for paying fines will fall to parents, officials said, and those 
unable to pay could face the same community service time as their children. 
</P>
<P>
 Minors who are not with their parents or guardians also would be prohibited 
from carrying spray paint, markers or devices used to etch graffiti. 
</P>
<P>
 Property owners also will be targeted under the new ordinance. For six months 
after the ordinance takes effect, the city will ask owners of property that has 
been repeatedly tagged to voluntarily clean up the markings or pay the city to 
do it. The payments would then become mandatory for owners whose property has 
been cleaned up by the city four or more times.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: PASADENA; FLEISS BEGINS 
TREATMENT FOR DRUGS; TRIAL SET OCT. 6 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Reputed Hollywood madam Heidi Fleiss entered a residential drug treatment 
center Monday as her state pandering and drug trial was rescheduled for Oct. 6, 
her attorney said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fleiss was transferred from the Downtown federal Metropolitan Detention Center 
to Pasadena's live-in Impact House, Donald Marks said.The attorney said he did 
not know how long his client would be at the center. 
</P>
<P>
 Fleiss, 28, was arrested earlier this month after testing positive for drugs 
in violation of the terms of her release from jail on charges of federal income 
tax evasion and money laundering. She had posted $50,000 bond and promised to 
remain drug-free. During a Sept. 19 hearing, Fleiss told the judge: "I want to 
go home." 
</P>
<P>
 But the judge instead sent her back to jail, pending her acceptance into the 
treatment center. 
</P>
<P>
 Fleiss and her pediatrician father, Dr. Paul Fleiss, face charges of 
depositing checks for prostitution services into his bank account and lying 
about income on their tax returns. 
</P>
<P>
 She faces state pandering and drug charges in a separate matter. Trial on 
those charges was to begin Monday, but a judge agreed last week to a motion 
delaying the trial for 15 days. On Monday the trial was scheduled for Oct. 6.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: HOLLYWOOD; MAN 
SENTENCED IN ABSENTIA FOR ASSAULTS ON WOMEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Hollywood man was sentenced in absentia Monday to a two-year jail term for 
posing as a director and sexually assaulting women who responded to his ad for 
an actress to appear in a film.  
</P>
<P>
 Hollywood Municipal Judge Michael Mink issued a $50,000 arrest warrant for 
Kirk Anthony Owens, 36, after he failed to show up for his sentencing hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 Owens was convicted last week by a Hollywood Municipal Court jury. Mink agreed 
to delay sentencing until Monday to allow the defense attorney time to locate 
her client, who walked out of the courtroom after the second day of testimony 
in his trial and did not return. 
</P>
<P>
 When Owens did not return to court and his attorney said she did not know her 
client's whereabouts, a police officer went to the defendant's apartment and 
discovered that he had moved out and left no forwarding address, said Deputy 
Dist. Atty. Mark Lambert. 
</P>
<P>
 Owens had been free on $50,000 bail posted by his parents. Mink ordered the 
bail forfeited, Lambert said. Owens' attorney told the judge that she had been 
in contact with her client since his conviction Thursday but that he would not 
appear for his sentencing. 
</P>
<P>
 Mink then imposed the two-year term, the maximum allowed by law for the 
offenses, and issued the arrest warrant. After an eight-day trial and two hours 
of deliberations, jurors found Owens guilty of one count each of sexual battery 
with restraint, sexual battery without restraint, battery and indecent 
exposure.

CAR KILLS GIRL, 7, AND INJURES SISTER ON WAY TO SCHOOL IN SAN PEDRO; TRAGEDY:

 Martin and Maria Ramirez wept as they talked about their young daughter's 
dreams, which ended Monday morning when an out-of-control car struck and killed 
the 7-year-old, Laura, and seriously injured their other young daughter as the 
sisters walked to school in San Pedro. 
</P>
<P>
 "Laura loved to dance," said Maria Ramirez, 27, sobbing as she clutched her 
husband's arm outside Harbor-UCLA Medical Center. "She wanted to be a dancer, a 
cheerleader, a doctor." 
</P>
<P>
 As Ramirez spoke, surgeons inside the hospital were fighting to save the badly 
damaged left leg and right foot of the Ramirezes' other daughter, Gizelle, also 
7. The Ramirezes said doctors hope the girl's leg and foot will not be lost, 
but it is uncertain what the long-term effects of the injuries will be. 
</P>
<P>
 Officer Mike Cummins of the Los Angeles Police Department said the accident 
occurred at 7:55 a.m. when a 1965 Jeep station wagon came down a hill on 19th 
Street, swerved around several cars waiting at a stop sign at South Alma 
Street, swerved again to avoid a car in the intersection and struck the two 
girls at about 25 m.p.h. Laura and Gizelle were waiting there to cross the 
street on their way to Leland Elementary School a few blocks away. 
</P>
<P>
 Laura Ramirez, a second-grader who turned 7 only two weeks ago, was killed 
instantly, police said. Gizelle Ramirez, a third-grader, landed on some grass 
and called for her mother as she lay there in pain, said Debra Smeltzer, 32, a 
neighbor who said she held the girl's hand and prayed until paramedics arrived. 
</P>
<P>
 "The more I prayed with her, the more she calmed down," Smeltzer said. "She 
kept holding on to me."  
</P>
<P>
 Police identified the driver of the Jeep as Gary Hartman, 31, of San Pedro. 
They said Hartman told them his vehicle's brakes had failed. No charges were 
filed, but police impounded the Jeep and the investigation is continuing. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin Ramirez said it was only through a simple twist of fate -- some 
misplaced car keys -- that he and his wife's only two children were standing at 
the corner. 
</P>
<P>
 "They never walk to school," said Ramirez, a chef who works an early morning 
shift at the 22nd Street Landing restaurant in San Pedro. "I always get off 
work and drive them to school and then go back to work. But I couldn't find my 
car keys, so I walked to work this morning, and they walked to school." 
</P>
<P>
 "When they left, I gave them both a kiss and said 'God bless you,' " Maria 
Ramirez said. The accident occurred about two blocks from the Ramirezes' 19th 
Street home. 
</P>
<P>
 Hartman, who could not be reached for comment, was emotionally devastated by 
the incident, said Bo Califano, 13, who lives with his mother and Hartman in a 
San Pedro home. "He was just lying there crying," the boy said. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at the elementary school called in psychologists to help children 
cope with news of the accident. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many of the kids don't comprehend it," Principal Richard Vladovic said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, neighbors stood outside their homes and grieved for hours after the 
accident. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sad," said Lina Cavedoni, 65, who walked from her home a block down the 
street to place a bouquet of white flowers at the site. "A girl is dead." 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Doggett, manager at the restaurant where Martin Ramirez works, said he is 
starting a fund for the Ramirez family. He can be reached at (310) 548-4400.

7 CHARGED IN COCAINE OPERATION RUN FROM SUBURBAN HOMES; CRIME: THE DEFENDANTS 
ALLEGEDLY STORED THE DRUG IN SAN GABRIEL VALLEY HOUSES FOR DROP-OFFS IN PARKING 
LOTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Seven Colombians, including two Westside men believed to be linchpins of the 
Cali cocaine cartel, were formally charged Monday in Los Angeles on allegations 
that they operated a sophisticated drug distribution network that used suburban 
homes as warehouses and San Gabriel Valley store parking lots as drop-off 
points. 
</P>
<P>
 The federal court proceedings, at which all but one of the defendants pleaded 
not guilty, came as part of a two-year federal campaign against the cartel, 
which is based in Cali, Colombia, and is believed to be responsible for most of 
the cocaine distributed in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant U.S. Atty. Lisa Lench, who is prosecuting the suspected traffickers, 
said nearly three tons of cocaine was seized in the operation. She said it was 
run by two "executives" who supervised a network of couriers in the San Gabriel 
Valley by phone from their homes on the Westside. 
</P>
<P>
 The alleged distribution bosses -- 30-year-old Diego Fernando 
Salazar-Izquierdo, alias "Zorro," and Over Arturo Acuna, 34, who was nicknamed 
"Brother" -- relayed their orders to couriers via an elaborate code that 
authorities cracked, the prosecutor said. 
</P>
<P>
 The two men, she said, operated only as middle men in the larger scheme of the 
cartel, but, from a federal standpoint, were "as high up as you get with 
Colombians in the United States." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration in Washington have said 
the case also is significant for what it reveals about the sophistication and 
flexibility of the Cali cartel's distribution methods. 
</P>
<P>
 The parallel operations that were being run by Salazar-Izquierdo and Acuna 
were set up after a series of drug seizures in Houston prompted the cartel to 
begin stockpiling cocaine in Mexico for shipment though Los Angeles, DEA 
supervisors said. 
</P>
<P>
 According to indictments unsealed Friday in U.S. District Court in Los 
Angeles, the two operations had been under investigation for the past five 
months by a task force of local and federal law enforcement agencies, who 
relied heavily on wiretaps and surveillance to make their cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Salazar-Izquierdo and Acuna, the indictments allege, dealt by phone with at 
least five accomplices who would pick up hundreds of kilograms of cocaine and 
store it in "stash houses," where it would eventually be picked up and sent to 
New York, Chicago or Canada. 
</P>
<P>
 The court papers detail the handling of shipment after shipment allegedly 
handled during the summer by the two men. In one case, authorities listened in 
as an unidentified Colombian caller told Salazar-Izquierdo in code that a 
shipment of cocaine had arrived June 11. Salazar-Izquierdo then allegedly used 
the same code to instruct his driver, Wilbert Moises (Josesillo) Lopez, 36, to 
make a pickup at a Rialto Jack in the Box. The following day, Lopez allegedly 
used the code to inform Salazar-Izquierdo that he had retrieved 638 kilograms 
of the drug. 
</P>
<P>
 The indictments include a number of similar pickups, most in Pasadena: 100 
kilos dropped off at a Vons supermarket, 194 kilos at a Hughes market lot, 150 
at a Ralphs, 80 at a pancake restaurant and 200 at a Thrifty store. 
</P>
<P>
 But other suburbs also got an unwitting piece of the action, prosecutors 
claim. The parking lot of a Thrifty in South Pasadena allegedly was the 
drop-off point for 84 kilos of coke; 349 kilos exchanged hands at the Santa 
Anita Fashion Park in Arcadia; 200 went through the Kmart lot in San Gabriel, 
186 through the Home Depot in Upland and 100 through the San Gabriel T.J. Maxx 
lot. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors said the cocaine was stored at four suburban homes, in Pasadena, 
South Pasadena, Arcadia and La Verne. 
</P>
<P>
 Indicted along with Salazar-Izquierdo, Acuna and Lopez were Jorge Sofrony 
Gordillo, 42, who was Acuna's roommate; Robinson Esmeral, 34, and Gustavo 
Arias-Pinzon, 40, who were arrested at an Arcadia home where 150 kilos of 
cocaine were seized; and Manuel Quevada, 31, a suspected courier who was 
arrested at an Arleta house where more than $139,000 in cash was seized, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 All defendants face life in prison if convicted. All but Lopez, who was not 
present, pleaded not guilty at their arraignment Monday. Trial is scheduled for 
Nov. 8 before U.S. District Judge Edward Rafeedie. 
</P>
<P>
 Lench said six other suspects are fugitives, and several others were 
investigated but not indicted. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would be naive to believe that we've put an end to it," she said, "but I 
think . . . they're going to have to regroup some because we took two of their 
most experienced people and figured out how they were doing it (running the 
operation)."

MOLINA HALTS BILLING OVER LIBRARY TAX; COUNTY: SUPERVISOR ORDERS PRINTING 
CANCELED WHEN SHE LEARNS DOCUMENTS WOULD INCLUDE A CHARGE TO PROPERTY OWNERS 
THAT HAS NOT RECEIVED FINAL APPROVAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Supervisor Gloria Molina on Monday halted the county's massive property tax 
mailing, saying bureaucrats were attempting to sneak through a new library tax 
that had only been tentatively approved. 
</P>
<P>
 Just minutes before workers in the treasurer/tax collector's office were to 
begin the annual printing and mailing of 2.5 million tax notices, Molina 
demanded that the process be stopped and the $16-million library tax assessment 
be stricken from the bills. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just unbelievable," Molina said. "This was a direct violation of the 
board's intent." 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, with Molina providing the critical swing vote, the Board of 
Supervisors approved a new property assessment that would raise funds for the 
strapped county library system. 
</P>
<P>
 But in voting for the tax, Molina also requested that the matter be brought 
back for reconsideration in early October -- before tax bills were mailed but 
after the county's financial books were closed so it could be determined if 
surplus funds were available to help the libraries. Molina said she would 
prefer to use any surplus rather than impose a new tax. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, with early reports of a county surplus that could total tens of millions 
of dollars, Molina said she will probably vote to kill the library tax. "I 
can't support (the tax) now, not after the way I have been misled," the 
supervisor said. 
</P>
<P>
 Molina said she personally interceded with tax collectors after she found that 
senior county officials with the authority to halt the mailing were on the golf 
course. 
</P>
<P>
 Treasurer/Tax Collector Larry Montheilh, County Counsel DeWitt Clinton and 
Chief Administrative Officer Sally Reed were attending the annual Consular 
Corps golf tournament at the Wilshire Country Club. Molina finally had a caddy 
from the club's pro shop track the officials down on the fairway and bring them 
to the telephone. 
</P>
<P>
 All three were unavailable for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Molina said she intends to closely question them about the timing of the 
mailing of the tax bills at the board's regularly scheduled meeting on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to line them up like the Three Stooges and slap them around a 
little," Molina said. "It's insubordination," she said of their plan to send 
out the tax notices. 
</P>
<P>
 The annual property tax bill is traditionally mailed in October, usually at 
least two weeks before the Nov. 1 due date. 
</P>
<P>
 Molina said that if for some reason she is unable to defeat the tax upon the 
vote for reconsideration, she may join a lawsuit brought by a pair of watchdog 
groups to overturn the library tax. 
</P>
<P>
 The tax would affect property owners in unincorporated county areas and 16 
cities that chose to join the assessment district.

SAN FERNANDO VALLEY GANGS MAINTAIN PRECARIOUS PEACE; CRIME: AN ACTIVIST SCARRED 
BY TRAGEDY IS GIVEN CREDIT FOR HELPING STEM VIOLENCE. THE EARTHQUAKE, THE 
MEXICAN MAFIA AND AN INCREASED POLICE PRESENCE ALSO MAY HAVE PLAYED ROLES.

<P>
 As a native of the East San Fernando Valley who grew up among street gangs and 
whose son was killed in a drive-by shooting, William (Blinky) Rodriguez is no 
stranger to gang violence. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, he has devoted the last four years to bringing about its end. 
</P>
<P>
 But the peacemaker who has known grief mourns again -- this time for the 
20-year-old boyfriend of his niece, stabbed to death last week in what police 
describe as a gang-related brawl in Mission Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 The murder of Daniel (Droopy) Pineda near a popular San Fernando Valley 
cruising strip was the first of its kind in the 11 months since Rodriguez and a 
band of other lay ministers organized a Valley-wide Latino gang truce. Besides 
being a tragedy for Rodriguez and his family, the fatal stabbing is being 
followed closely by police, gangsters and neighborhood activists for any sign 
that the delicate truce struck last Halloween may now unravel. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, the deeply religious Rodriguez is optimistic, noting that a week after 
Pineda's death, representatives from 18 gangs still attended a Sunday afternoon 
meeting in Pacoima Park, a weekly event held to mediate differences without 
resorting to violence. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we lose this, we've lost something that's never happened before," 
Rodriguez said Monday. "But the reality is, we still have a peace treaty going 
on." 
</P>
<P>
 There seems to be no question that gang-related homicides in the San Fernando 
Valley have dropped dramatically since an estimated 75 local Latino gangs -- 
prompted by orders from the powerful, prison-based Mexican Mafia, according to 
authorities -- agreed last fall to set aside their weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 As of August, the Los Angeles Police Department had recorded nine such 
killings -- compared to 35 for the same period last year -- and Rodriguez 
maintains that none of the nine deaths involved innocent bystanders. 
Gang-related felony assaults -- including attempted murder -- have also 
decreased to 418 through August of this year, compared to 589 for the same 
period last year. 
</P>
<P>
 The unprecedented truce followed months of work by Rodriguez and other 
Christian-oriented youth leaders who spent nights and weekends dashing from one 
gang altercation to another, defusing emotions and urging rivals to talk. 
Rodriguez, the 40-year-old co-owner of a Van Nuys martial arts center, had 
worked for years with teen-agers and young adults as a boxing and kick-boxing 
coach, trying to steer them away from crime. 
</P>
<P>
 He redoubled his anti-violence campaign in 1990 after the death of his 
16-year-old son, Sonny. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm still trying to reconcile within myself whether he was a (gang) member or 
not," Rodriguez said. 
</P>
<P>
 But while police praise Rodriguez's achievements, and say they welcome any 
effort that stems gang bloodshed, authorities suggest that other factors have 
contributed to the decrease in homicides. 
</P>
<P>
 The Jan. 17 Northridge earthquake, for example, seemed to quell crimes of all 
kinds, in part because more uniformed police and other officials were on city 
streets. And additional funds for police overtime -- the first in years under a 
new City Hall crime-fighting plan -- also deserve credit for increasing the 
number of patrol cars and inhibiting criminal acts, said Los Angeles Police Lt. 
Fred Tuller. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a lot of factors taking place this year that have affected gang 
crime and violent crime in general, and Blinky's efforts are one of those 
factors," said Tuller, who coordinates the LAPD'S anti-gang units in the 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "I will give him credit; I think he has played a positive role," Tuller said. 
"But to what degree, I'm not a scorekeeper, I don't know." 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever record the peace treaty had was marred Sept. 18 when Pineda, a house 
painter from Palmdale and the father of two young sons, was killed near the old 
San Fernando Mission in a showdown that LAPD Det. Frank Bishop called typical. 
</P>
<P>
 Drinking in his parked car with three friends, on his way to watch a boxing 
match on closed-circuit TV, Pineda was approached by a group of other youths 
who asked him where he was from, meaning his neighborhood or gang affiliation. 
When he replied he was a "Sanfer," a member of a San Fernando-based gang, he 
was beaten and fatally stabbed, according to police. A male companion, 
similarly attacked, survived. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was the wrong thing to say," said Bishop, who supervises homicide 
investigations for the Foothill Division. The Pineda case is unsolved, he 
added. 
</P>
<P>
 Bishop, without providing specifics, also said there were more gang-related 
attacks later that night and in the days that followed which he believes were 
meant as retaliation. "We've had a steady flow," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 Pineda was buried Saturday in Newhall before an estimated 300 to 400 mourners, 
and Rodriguez is clinging to the hope that his death will remain an isolated 
incident as peace-keeping efforts go on. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really hard to define why Daniel was killed," he said. "It just happened 
and a lot of people were just shocked about it. I mean, like, dang man, a lot 
of people were disappointed. . . . When you lose someone like that, the hate is 
going to get turned up," Rodriguez acknowledged. "But the factions involved are 
working to get things resolved in a way that would be positive."

SPECIAL ENVOYS; HALE MIDDLE SCHOOL HOSTS SIXTH-GRADERS FROM CHINA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It only took one day for a group of 75 visiting Chinese sixth-graders to shuck 
their matching green and white school uniforms for American blue jeans. But 
despite the rebellious look, they still couldn't resist getting up extra early 
for their first day of school. 
</P>
<P>
 The youngest delegation of foreign exchange students between China and the 
United States piled out of a yellow school bus Monday and lined up in rows long 
before the tardy bell rang at Hale Middle School in Woodland Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 "At 7:30 they were already ready," said Christine Tung, president of the 
Sino-U.S. Business and Technology Exchange, a transpacific company that 
arranged the student exchange program. "They were so excited. They kept saying, 
'When are we going to go to school?' " 
</P>
<P>
 The Chinese youths -- who are from the Heroes School in Guangzhou, China -- 
will spend the fall semester at Hale, studying English and American culture. 
Next year, the Los Angeles Unified School District expects to send a U.S. 
delegation to Heroes -- the first private school in China -- where the 
$30,000-a-year tuition will be waived. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the students' arrival from halfway around the world, Tung said there 
have been a few incidents of culture shock: one child was found trying to stuff 
a $50 bill into a soda machine at the Woodland Hills apartment complex where 
they will live this fall. 
</P>
<P>
 The visitors, Tung said, still have a lot to learn. 
</P>
<P>
 At Hale, the Chinese youngsters will be taking two English classes, math, 
social studies, physical education and an elective, said Grace Pang Bovy, an 
adviser with the school district's Asian Pacific and Other Languages office. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hale has been very good in meeting the needs of ESL students," said Bovy, 
which is why the exchange program is being conducted at the Woodland Hills 
school. 
</P>
<P>
 Hale teachers expect American students will also learn from their guests. 
</P>
<P>
 "We hope our students will learn respect from them," said Karen Stafford, 
Hale's bilingual coordinator who oversees the English as a Second Language 
program that represents 29 languages spoken at the school. 
</P>
<P>
 As far as cultural exchange, "hopefully (the Chinese students) will not return 
wearing baggy pants," Stafford joked. 
</P>
<P>
 Chinese-American students, who speak Cantonese and Mandarin Chinese, will 
serve as translators throughout the semester. They and student government 
leaders took the Chinese students on a tour of the Hale campus Monday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 As they wandered about the campus, through the nurse's room and the attendance 
office, the tour guides introduced the Chinese youths to the complexities of 
getting excused for an absence and the perils of the eighth-grade lawn, which 
is reserved for the school's oldest students. 
</P>
<P>
 Student body vice president Nicole Sauler, 13, explained to her new peers: 
"You can't be on the lawn during nutrition and lunch." 
</P>
<P>
 Felicia Khong, 12, who speaks Cantonese, said the Chinese students asked her 
questions such as how the drinking fountain works and how to open hall lockers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never seen so many Chinese in one place," Khong said, delighted to be 
using her bilingual ability. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're so shy," remarked 12-year-old Sarah Farzam, as she tried to talk to 
some of the Chinese girls. 
</P>
<P>
 "They like to hold hands and stuff," Farzam said. She seemed a little peeved 
that the girls laughed at her when she tried to say in Cantonese -- with help 
from a translator -- that she thought their shoes were cute. 
</P>
<P>
 Howard Luck, 13, and his buddy Steve Aure, 12, plunked themselves down at a 
cafeteria table in the midst of several giggling Chinese girls, hoping to 
befriend them. 
</P>
<P>
 Communicating by drawing pictures in a notebook, Luck said he wanted to 
introduce himself to the exchange students and help them get around at Hale. 
"It's a unique experience to have kids from another country," Luck said.

SCOTT HARRIS: ATMOSPHERE PLEASE, AND MAKE IT A DOUBLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HARRIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A pilgrimage, Webster's will tell you, is a journey "to a shrine or a holy 
place." Or it's "any long journey, as to a place of historical interest." 
</P>
<P>
 It was with this spirit that I searched for Cinnabar, a restaurant and bar in 
Glendale, excited by the promise of something more. It wasn't Cinnabar, per se, 
that interested me, but it was there, rumor had it, that one could find a 
beloved relic of L.A.'s past -- the transplanted innards of Yee Mee Loo, the 
Chinatown dive that provided succor to Angelenos from 1939 until 1990. Whether 
you called it by its proper name or by the possessive Yee Mee Loo's, devotees 
will testify that it was a truly great bar, probably the best in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The rumors, I'm happy to report, are true. Here, indeed, is the grand, ornate 
back bar, displaying the carved figurines representing the eight immortals of 
Chinese lore. From the ceiling hangs the scrolled silk lanterns in all their 
tattered glory. Against the back wall is the old Rock-ola jukebox loaded with 
scratchy 45s -- Billie Holliday, Hoagy Carmichael, Duke Ellington. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 I had to test the bartender. 
</P>
<P>
 "Know how to make a Tidy Bowl?" 
</P>
<P>
 This was a Yee Mee Loo original, a mysterious concoction that got its 
distinctive hue from blue curacao. Jason the bartender knew what I was talking 
about, but seemed unsure of the recipe -- whether it requires rum or vodka or 
either or both. There are, Jason suggested, a couple of recipes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Richard was here the other night," Jason said. "He brought some incense. 
We're still trying to get the right formula from him." 
</P>
<P>
 Richard would be Richard Mah, Yee Mee Loo's last bartender, who now practices 
his art at Chinatown's Grand Star. Alvin Simon, Cinnabar's owner and host, was 
so assiduous in his quest to re-create Yee Mee Loo that he tried to hire 
Richard, he says, but Richard is apparently content in Chinatown. 
</P>
<P>
 Simon knows very well that an institution as storied as Yee Mee Loo cannot be 
replicated by salvaging some artifacts. The mystique of Yee Mee Loo was created 
by a richer alchemy -- a blend that included the seedy neighborhood and a 
clientele that at any time might include postal workers, prosecutors and 
loft-dwelling poets drinking Tidy Bowls and $1.25 Budweisers side by side. "The 
beauty of Yee Mee Loo," Simon said, "is that you'd get the guys from the vice 
squad and the guys they were after." 
</P>
<P>
 Simon said. Sounds like a game. There was something about Alvin Simon that 
seemed familiar; it's possible that we had chatted at Yee Mee Loo long ago. He 
shrugged and smiled. "Well, I'm two of three chipmunks," said Alvin Simon. "The 
only one that's missing is Theodore." 
</P>
<P>
 We talked a bit about great bars, and the dearth thereof. Yee Mee Loo, it 
seems, fell victim to the greed of a landlord who (a) envisioned a new shopping 
center on the block and (b) didn't want to pay for seismic safety improvements 
in the meantime. What seemed like a good idea in the money-grubbing '80s, 
however, now looks like a bad idea. The building that housed Yee Mee Loo sits 
shamefully empty. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there was the Firefly in Hollywood, a place on Vine I'd visited only 
twice. It featured identical twin bartenders who for a modest consideration 
would squirt a line of lighter fluid along the runner and set a match to it. 
The flame would race from one end of the bar to the other. For some reason, the 
authorities shut that place down. 
</P>
<P>
 How many great bars are left? Simon suggested the bar at Musso & Frank; I 
countered with the Formosa, also in Hollywood. Tiki Ti and Kelbo's, we agreed, 
are wonderful in their own ways. Thinking of good bars was easy. Great bars 
were something else. Then I posed a tougher question: What about the Valley? 
Are there any great bars in the greater San Fernando Valley? Are there any good 
bars? 
</P>
<P>
 Before embarking on my pilgrimage, I e-mailed this question to my colleagues 
and received numerous responses. Predictable ones included Sagebrush Cantina in 
Calabasas and Residuals in Studio City. An editorial writer recommended the 
sake at Genmai in Sherman Oaks and an assignment editor credits the American 
Culinary Institute restaurant at the Los Angeles Equestrian Center for having 
"the best selection of champagne by the glass." A veteran reporter confessed 
that he and his wife "are regulars at (don't laugh) the bar at Marie 
Callender's. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 Sake ? Champagne? Marie Callender's??? 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately, some reporters understood. The Red Chariot, the Lamplighter, 
Weber's Place, the Barrel, Pineapple Hill, the Dugout and Rocky's were among 
the recommended "dives." The colleague who seemed to be our best authority went 
on to define Le Cafe in Sherman Oaks and Tribeca in Encino as "cool watering 
holes" and recommended Prezzo's in Sherman Oaks in the "meat market" category. 
</P>
<P>
 Obviously, there is much research to be done. 
</P>
<P>
 Cinnabar was a good start. Here on the ground floor of the old Bekins 
warehouse on Brand, the remnants of a truly great bar had transported me. Alvin 
Simon says he tried to buy other Yee Mee Loo artifacts, like the autographed 
photo of Babe Ruth and the clock that moved counterclockwise. But the family 
wouldn't sell those. 
</P>
<P>
 I checked the jukebox, remembering a romantic night and a slow dance with a 
sweetheart in that dark, crowded room. It was, if memory serves, our third 
date. A guy at the bar looked at us and practically shouted: "Kiss her! Take 
her home!" 
</P>
<P>
 That was another thing about Yee Mee Loo -- there was no shortage of good 
advice. 
</P>

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: RESEDA; STUDENTS TAKE TRASH COURSE IN PIRU CREEK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC SLATER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Looking like fleeing refugees, they slogged through the brackish water of the 
slow-moving stream, dragging behind them plastic bags filled with shoes, food, 
diapers. 
</P>
<P>
 They ducked in and out of the rustling reeds and splashed quickly after one 
bag of goods that had floated away. 
</P>
<P>
 The stream was no war-torn border crossing, however, and the bag was hardly 
worth rescuing; it was but one of dozens filled Monday by Reseda High School 
students gathering broken Corona beer bottles, flip-flops and Pampers from the 
shores and bottom of Piru Creek. 
</P>
<P>
 "These people are pigs," 14-year-old Kenneth Fregozo said of the littering 
campers. 
</P>
<P>
 The trip to the creek north of Castaic marked the first outing for the members 
of Reseda High's new Environmental/Physical Sciences Magnet Center. For many of 
the students, it was their first venture into the Angeles National Forest. And 
for most, the scene was appalling. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been to places that are dirty," said 13-year-old Natalia Alfaro, "but 
this beats them all." 
</P>
<P>
 Rotting mattresses, sprawling sheets of plastic, a shattered yellow child's 
chair lined the creek near Frenchmans Flat. Soda cans floated in the water and 
work boots were buried in silt. 
</P>
<P>
 The magnet school, established in May, is designed to offer students 
interested in science a more intense curriculum of study than would typically 
be found at a public school, preparing them either for college or careers in 
fields from physics to forestry. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday's field trip was aimed at giving 60 of the 90 magnet school students a 
taste of the Los Angeles-area wilderness, and of the serious threats to its 
once-pristine streams. 
</P>
<P>
 Muddy shopping carts and floating boxer shorts are not what one hopes to find 
on an early morning fishing trip, obviously, but the students learned that 
litter along streams can be more than an eyesore.  
</P>
<P>
 Birds can get trapped in the plastic rings used to bind six-packs, said Scott 
Mathes, executive director of the California Environmental Project, which 
helped organize the outing. Animals will eat food-stained Styrofoam and can 
die. Bacteria from human excrement can work their way into the stream, killing 
fingerling trout and threatening drinking water. 
</P>
<P>
 After a morning spent taking Piru Creek's temperature (68 degrees), measuring 
its pH level (6), and learning how such figures play into the health of the 
stream, the students donned green rubber gloves and settled in for the dirty 
work. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hopefully, this will help instill a responsible environmental ethic," said 
magnet school coordinator Tony Recalde. 
</P>
<P>
 The experience did just that, several students said, promising never again to 
toss a Big Gulp cup from the car or answer the call of nature within 200 feet 
of a stream. 
</P>
<P>
 But after several hours' work, far more trash remained on the ground than in 
the plastic bags. And all of it had accumulated in less than a year, Recalde 
said, as he and another group of students had cleaned up this same creek six 
month ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Keith Pochmara, 15, shook his head. "I would think people would have more 
common sense." ERIC SLATER

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SHERMAN OAKS; FASHION SQUARE PROPOSAL GETS MIXED REACTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAY HWANGBO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Local residents expressed mixed reactions to the proposed expansion of the 
Sherman Oaks Fashion Square shopping mall at a zoning hearing Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Of 100 people who attended the hearing at the Sherman Oaks Woman's Club, about 
40% appeared to be opposed, roughly 40% seemed supportive, and the rest did not 
express an opinion, said Los Angeles hearing examiner Eric Ritter. 
</P>
<P>
 Fashion Square wants to do a $20-million expansion that would increase the 
size of the mall by nearly 20%. Its owners hope to attract an upscale 
department store to replace the I. Magnin that left the mall late last year. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, after hearing a presentation by mall representatives and comments 
from residents, Ritter said he would review the information and make a 
recommendation to the Planning Commission in about three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics of the project say the expansion will exacerbate existing problems of 
air pollution, traffic and noise created by the mall. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the current problems are going to get worse," said Patricia Boyd, who 
lives on nearby Stern Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Boyd said that traffic on Riverside Drive next to the mall is always backed up 
because of trucks stopping to load and unload merchandise. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unfortunately, the mall is already built out," said Allen Abshez, who 
represented the mall owner, City Freeholds USA. "We bought it with those things 
in place -- we can't change it with a finger snap. It's something we work on 
constantly to make sure we are not a nuisance to the neighborhood."

 "I feel good about it (the hearing)," said Abshez, who said that the 
complaints of project critics were mostly related to the current operations of 
the mall rather than the proposed expansion. KAY HWANGBO

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE; ASSAULTS RISE, BUT CRIME DIPS OVERALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The number of assaults reported in Glendale during the first half of 1994 
increased 25% over last year, but police said last week that the number of 
major crimes reported overall has actually dropped about 9%. 
</P>
<P>
 According to statistics released by the Glendale Police Department, the number 
of robberies, burglaries and auto thefts all dropped considerably between 
January and June.  
</P>
<P>
 There were 164 robberies reported, 39 fewer than during the first six months 
of 1993. There were 636 burglaries, 241 fewer than in the first half of 1993; 
and there were 660 cars stolen, a decrease of 162. 
</P>
<P>
 Felony assaults increased from 133 during the same period in 1993 to 167 this 
year -- a rise of 25.6% -- but Jack Altounian, the Police Department's crime 
analyst, maintains that the numbers do not indicate a major surge in violent 
crime in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "The number of assaults in our city is still very low compared to other cities 
with populations over 100,000," Altounian said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think Glendale is necessarily becoming more violent, but I would say 
that it seems there are certain elements in the society that may be becoming 
that way." 
</P>
<P>
 Altounian said the department has not changed the way assaults are reported 
and the reasons for the increase is unknown. 
</P>
<P>
 Also listed in the city's midyear crime analysis report were: 
</P>
<P>
 * Rapes, which decreased from 14 during the first half of 1993 to seven this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 * Murders, of which there were four in the first half of 1993, and just one 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
 * Reports of stolen property, which rose from 2,101 in the first six months of 
1993 to 2,152 this year, an increase of 2.4%. 
</P>
<P>
 * Arson, of which there were 37 reported incidents in the first half of 1993 
and 22 in the same period this year, a drop of 40.5%. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, there were 3,470 major crimes reported in Glendale during the period, 
compared to 3,837 last year, a decrease of 367 incidents, Altounian said. STEVE

GETTING INVOLVED: MAKING A DIFFERENCE IN YOUR COMMUNITY; HORSE RIDING GIVES 
BALANCE TO SPECIAL KIDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ED BOND, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At the Special Equestrian Riding Center in Agoura, volunteers help people with 
disabilities learn balance and motor skills by riding horses. 
</P>
<P>
 But the lessons often go two ways. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can learn a lot from our riders," said Nora Fischbach, program director of 
the center, which uses horses in physical therapy for people with a wide range 
of disabilities, including head wounds, Down's syndrome and multiple sclerosis. 
</P>
<P>
 Although volunteers help to motivate the riders to perform a series of tasks 
at the group's 1,000-acre ranch in Agoura, the riders can also be 
inspirational. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the kids try hard, it motivates them to try hard too," Fischbach said. 
"They can see that their problems aren't as difficult." 
</P>
<P>
 The 50 riders in the program range in age from 18 months to 60 years, but most 
are children. Every attempt at every task is cheered by volunteers and when the 
riders perform in the shows held by the center or other groups, there are no 
losers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our philosophy here is trying is winning," said Fischbach, adding that 
volunteers are as much a part of the cheering squad as the rider's family. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the best part of volunteering is that you become part of an extended 
family," Fischbach said. 
</P>
<P>
 Former riders who have overcome their disability have gone on to become 
volunteers themselves, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Volunteers work in teams of three, working 30 minutes to an hour and a half 
with each rider every week. The program differs from other physical 
rehabilitation programs because the horseback activities are more fun and can 
subtly teach students the nuances of walking and balance.  
</P>
<P>
 Equestrian rehabilitation programs have helped children who have never taken a 
step before learn how to walk.  
</P>
<P>
 The riding therapy program was created by parents of disabled children in 
1987. Fischbach said volunteers are needed because of the center's loss of its 
stable of summer volunteers. No special skills or knowledge of horses are 
required. However, the better volunteers are those who are comfortable working 
with children with disabilities, Fischbach said. 
</P>
<P>
 Volunteers are asked to commit to working at least three hours a week. Therapy 
sessions are held Monday, Wednesday and Friday afternoons and Saturday 
mornings. Volunteers must be 13 years or older. Training, including CPR and 
first aid, is provided. To volunteer, or for further information, call 
Fischbach at (818) 776-6476. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Pet Orphans Fund is looking for volunteers to help exercise and care for 
dogs and cats. Volunteers are required to take classes at the kennels. The 
group is looking for commitments of at least 10 hours a month. The pets can be 
exercised on the weekends or during the week. The Pet Orphans Fund, a private, 
nonprofit group in Van Nuys started 25 years ago, matches families wanting pets 
with animals. For more information call (818) 901-0190. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Adults who would like to read aloud to groups of children are needed to help 
with a Glendale Public Library program. Volunteer readers are needed for 
weekday afternoons at three library sites and for weekend mornings in local 
elementary schools. Interested adults must be willing to give two hours a week 
for at least 10 months. No experience is necessary. For more information or to 
register call Carolyn Flemming, coordinator of children's library services, at 
(818) 548-3999. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Docent training has begun at the William O. Douglas Outdoor Classroom, 2600 
Franklin Canyon Drive, Beverly Hills. Training is held on Saturdays with most 
classes scheduled from 9:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. The outdoor classroom is one of 
six offered by the Mountains Education Program, a nonprofit group whose goal is 
to foster respect and understanding of the natural world. For more information 
call (310) 858-3090.

 A court hearing on Burbank Airport's plans to build a new, larger terminal has 
been postponed until Nov. 28 to give airport officials more time to prepare, an 
attorney said. 
</P>
<P>
 Airport officials are under a Superior Court judge's orders to redo work on an 
environmental report that concludes the terminal will not significantly 
increase noise in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 The airport's governing board has until Oct. 31 to approve an updated 
environmental study before it is presented to the judge, said Deputy City Atty. 
Keith Pritsker. VIVIEN LOU CHEN

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: NORTH HOLLYWOOD; HOTEL EXPANSION GETS PRELIMINARY OK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAY HWANGBO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Planning Commission has recommended approval of a major 
expansion of a hotel, co-owned by actress Beverly Garland, located off the 
Hollywood Freeway at Vineland Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission on Thursday backed a zone change and General Plan amendment for 
the property containing Beverly Garland's Holiday Inn from multifamily housing 
to community commercial.  
</P>
<P>
 If the zone change is approved by the City Council, the hotel will be allowed 
to add a seven-story building, 24,000-square feet of retail space and 
additional space for its restaurant and health club. 
</P>
<P>
 Hotel owners want to increase the inn's size by a total 100,000 square feet. 
Previous owners had received a zoning variance to develop the hotel, at 4222 
Vineland Ave. 
</P>
<P>
 Garland and her husband, another hotel co-owner, are "just delighted because 
they have been trying to get the hotel back on its feet after three or four 
years of it going downhill" due to the recession and the hotel's low-profile 
location, said Pauline Amond, who represents the hotel.  
</P>
<P>
 The commission recommended a height variance to allow the new tower to reach 
85 feet, but opposed the owners' request to designate the property a regional 
commercial center. Under the commission's recommendation, the hotel would be 
allowed to erect only interior signs for the new retail shops, which may 
include jewelry boutiques, souvenir shops, beauty parlors, barber shops and 
nail salons. 
</P>
<P>
 Tony Lucente, president of the Studio City Residents Assn., said he thinks the 
retail space should be scaled back to 18,000 square feet and a previously 
approved 60-foot pole sign eliminated.  
</P>
<P>
 "Our next step will be to review the Planning Commission's report, compare it 
with our request, meet with the developer if they desire, give them the 
opportunity to meet some of these conditions, and we'll consider at that point 
whether we appeal," Lucente said. KAY HWANGBO

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SYLMAR; MISSION COLLEGE TO BEGIN LIBRARY PROJECT

<TEXT>
<P>
 Mission College will begin its 20th Anniversary Celebration at 11:30 a.m. 
Thursday with a ground-breaking ceremony for the college's $11-million library 
and learning resources center. 
</P>
<P>
 The new three-level facility will encompass 57,000 square feet and includes a 
24,425-square-foot library -- three times the size of the current makeshift 
library, located in the basement of the campus center. 
</P>
<P>
 The new building also will house a computer center, tutoring center, 
teleconference center and an audiovisual studio. The building is expected to be 
completed by the fall of 1997. When it's done, the number of computer terminals 
available to Mission College students will increase from 130 to 530. 
</P>
<P>
 Funding for the facility was obtained through a state bond measure approved by 
voters in 1992. Construction will be carried out by Lewis Jorge Construction 
Management Inc. of Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 The addition of the new facility brings the total number of buildings on the 
college campus to five. Mission College serves about 5,800 students. TIM MAY

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: ROBOT COACHES CHILDREN IN TAKING CARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MANNING

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As if by some miracle, the 175 elementary and kindergarten students gathered 
for Monday's assembly were almost perfectly behaved.  
</P>
<P>
 There was no pinching or giggling, and curiously, there was barely a whisper 
from any of the children in the auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
 The kids were breathless with anticipation of the arrival of Caring Coach, the 
much-ballyhooed traveling robot who was coming to visit them at Canoga Park 
Elementary School. 
</P>
<P>
 They let out a hearty cheer when Caring Coach wheeled into the hall, bringing 
his own strobe-light show and music -- an upbeat, blaring rendition of "La 
Bamba." 
</P>
<P>
 "You guys are looking great," Caring Coach greeted the cheering kids as he 
launched into a routine designed to teach them how to take better care of 
themselves.  
</P>
<P>
 Among other things, he advised them to stay away from drugs and cigarettes and 
to not be afraid to express their emotions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody gets angry sometimes," the robot said. "It's OK to have all kinds 
of feelings." 
</P>
<P>
 The robot is sponsored by the California School Nurses Organization, the 
CaliforniaKids Healthcare Foundation and Blue Cross of California. The 
foundation provides premium-free health care services to children ages 2 to 18 
whose working parents can't afford private health insurance but make too much 
money to qualify for state assistance programs. 
</P>
<P>
 The students and teachers get classroom material as part of the Caring Coach 
program, which can be integrated into school courses, said Cathy Woolfolk, a 
spokeswoman for CaliforniaKids. Teachers also get curriculum guides that help 
them weave the Caring Coach's teachings into course work. 
</P>
<P>
 The robot's appearance at the Canoga Park school is an experiment that 
district officials hope will be expanded to the entire school system, said 
Virginia Hayes, director of nursing services for the Los Angeles Unified School 
District. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a learning tool that is very stimulating to children," she said. "This 
is a visual aid, something they can relate to. They know about robots." 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the children said they learned something from Caring Coach's visit. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to take good care of the planet, and ourselves and our bodies," 
third-grader Gloria Romero said. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles City Councilwoman Laura Chick, who attended the assembly, said the 
program might also fight crime. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look at the potential of the children in this room," she said. "You have to 
put more police on the streets right now, but if we put more money into these 
kinds of things, we wouldn't need as many police later on." FRANK MANNING

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: UNITY COALITION CONFERENCE AT CSUN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ED BOND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The San Fernando Valley Unity Coalition, formed after the riots of April, 
1992, to ensure that the Valley was not ignored as Los Angeles began its 
recovery, will hold a conference Saturday at Cal State Northridge aimed at 
building an even stronger voice for the region. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the riots came and the earthquake came, a lot of the resources went to 
Downtown L.A. and we were left holding the bag with promises," said Ed 
Viramontes, executive director of the Mid Valley YMCA, who will take over as 
president of the Coalition in October, 1995.  
</P>
<P>
 The coalition was formed so that the Valley could effectively appeal for help 
by showing a clear picture of its needs, Viramontes said. 
</P>
<P>
 "When people look at the Valley, they see Encino, Sherman Oaks, and Studio 
City," Viramontes said, and not the more impoverished neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 In attacking that image, the coalition will present a report Saturday showing 
that poverty in the Valley is more widespread than had been known, especially 
in areas such as Pacoima, and sections of Van Nuys and Canoga Park. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're attempting to build a stronger voice for the Valley," Viramontes said. 
</P>
<P>
 The coalition was organized by 60 Valley organizations that deal with issues 
such as health care, economic development, education and government. The 
increased communication among the agencies has helped them find new solutions 
to problems. For example, the YMCA is working more closely with the Los Angeles 
Parks and Recreation Department. And the networking among the groups helps 
foster such achievements as the gang truce among Valley gangs that started last 
year, Viramontes said. 
</P>
<P>
 The coalition also is trying to empower the growing ethnic minorities in the 
Valley, such as Latinos, Filipinos and Koreans, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to diversify," Viramontes said. "We have to welcome them into these 
community groups and we have to teach them how to belong." 
</P>
<P>
 The coalition meets the first Thursday of every month at the American Red 
Cross offices in Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
 The conference, which is co-sponsored by Cal State Northridge, starts at 8:30 
a.m. and runs until 3 p.m. and includes sessions on networking and community 
issues and talks by city officials such as Deputy Police Chief Martin Pomeroy.

2 MEN KILLED IN UNRELATED METROLINK INCIDENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIMOTHY WILLIAMS and JEANNETTE REGALADO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two men were killed Monday by Metrolink trains in separate incidents, raising 
the number of Los Angeles commuter-train deaths to three in the past four days. 
</P>
<P>
 Metrolink officials said it is the first time two people have died in separate 
incidents on a single day since the train service began in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a very unusual occurrence," said Metrolink spokesman Peter Hidalgo. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest death was Monday at about 5:20 p.m. when a 41-year-old man wearing 
headphones and listening to loud music was struck from behind as he walked on 
the train tracks between Riverdale Drive and Goodwin Avenue on the southeast 
border of Glendale, Hidalgo said. 
</P>
<P>
 The man, whose identity was being withheld until his family was notified, 
lived nearby and often used the railroad tracks as a short cut from his bus 
stop to home, say authorities who interviewed the man's roommate. 
</P>
<P>
 "He did not heed any of the warnings," Hidalgo said, including the train horn. 
"And he was walking illegally on our tracks." 
</P>
<P>
 The train was traveling about 70 m.p.h. after leaving the Glendale train 
station with no passengers aboard, Hidalgo said. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier, in San Fernando, witnesses told police that a man in his 30s was 
killed when he intentionally dove into the path of a Metrolink commuter train 
at a rail crossing. The man's identity has also been withheld pending 
notification of relatives. 
</P>
<P>
 San Fernando police said witnesses saw this man lingering at the Brand 
Boulevard rail crossing about 9:45 a.m. Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Metrolink train -- headed south from Santa Clarita to Downtown -- 
approached the crossing, the signal arm went down, red lights started flashing 
and warning bells began ringing, said Lt. Dan Peavy of the San Fernando Police 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Then the man began crossing the tracks, witnesses told police. 
</P>
<P>
 As the 400-ton train approached at 60 m.p.h., witnesses said the man lunged 
toward it. 
</P>
<P>
 "He literally timed his dive in front of the train," Hidalgo said. "People who 
saw it said he purposely went low." The train traveled a quarter-mile before it 
could stop. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses told police that the victim, judging by his appearance, "may have 
been homeless," Peavy said.

<P>
 None of the 19 passengers aboard the train was injured.  
</P>
<P>
 On Friday evening, 21-year-old Barry Alfred George of Northridge died after he 
walked into the path of an oncoming Metrolink train in Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 "Suicides are unpredictable and random acts, and there's nothing you can do," 
Hidalgo said. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said suicides account for about half of the 28 fatalities that have 
occurred on Metrolink tracks since the commuter train service began operating.

BANK EXECUTIVE PLEADS GUILTY TO FRAUD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The former chief financial officer of American West Bank on Monday pleaded 
guilty to three counts of bank fraud, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael S. Leon, 37, of Riverside County admitted to FBI investigators that he 
embezzled more than $280,000 from the San Fernando Valley bank over a four-year 
period, said Special Assistant U.S. Atty. Steven Jay Katzman. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is unusual for this sort of fraud to go undetected for that long," Katzman 
said. "But because of his responsibilities he was in a position to cover it up 
by falsifying the books." 
</P>
<P>
 Leon began diverting funds from the general ledger, operating and expense 
accounts of American West Bank in January, 1989, according to court records. 
Leon then purchased cashiers' checks and money orders and deposited them into 
his personal checking account, or paid off creditors, Katzman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other personal expenses, Leon used the money to pay $1,269 in charges on 
his American Express credit card in 1991 and $6,250 for a membership at the 
Porter Valley Country Club in 1993, records show. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are glad that we caught him," Katzman said. "It is upsetting when someone 
in authority does this." 
</P>
<P>
 During the time of the theft, Leon was moving up the bank's corporate ladder, 
rising from an assistant vice president to chief financial officer, records 
show. 
</P>
<P>
 With that position came almost sole responsibility for the preparation and 
approval of the bank's general ledger entries, reconciliation of the general 
ledger to accounting records and data processing reports, and payment of the 
bank's bills. Leon also had the authority to issue cashiers' checks and money 
orders on behalf of American West Bank. 
</P>
<P>
 Leon is scheduled to be sentenced in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles on 
Dec. 12. He is facing a maximum of 90 years, said Katzman, but because he 
cooperated with investigators he may be sentenced to as little as two years.

NORTHRIDGE MEADOWS TO BE RAZED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 For more than eight months, the listing hulk of the Northridge Meadows 
Apartments complex has haunted the 9500 block of Reseda Boulevard, a constant 
reminder of the 16 deaths that occurred there during the Jan. 17 Northridge 
earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, attorneys and city officials say, Northridge Meadows finally will 
start coming down. 
</P>
<P>
 The final demolition of Northridge Meadows will take about a month, according 
to Los Angeles attorney Robert Freedman, who represents owners Shashikant and 
Renuka Jogani in several wrongful death lawsuits resulting from the collapse of 
the 164-unit complex in the moments following the magnitude 6.8 temblor. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said they expect to award a $281,500 demolition contract 
Wednesday to Cleveland Wrecking Co., the lowest bidder. The following day, 
Freedman said, the contractor will set up offices and begin demolition. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal funds will be used for the demolition under a Federal Emergency 
Management Agency program that has already resulted in the demolition of 134 
quake-damaged buildings since February. Another 96 buildings are targeted for 
demolition under the program, according to a spokesman for the city Department 
of Public Works. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge Meadows, site of the largest concentration of earthquake 
fatalities, is located in one of 13 so-called "ghost towns" of vacant, 
quake-damaged buildings in the San Fernando Valley. It also is the subject of 
seven lawsuits alleging that construction and design defects contributed to the 
fatal collapse of the three-story building's first floor. The 16 tenants who 
died all lived in first-floor apartments. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier, a court order had precluded demolition of Northridge Meadows until 
structural engineers and other experts could comb through the 
156,000-square-foot building for evidence of what may have caused the collapse. 
</P>
<P>
 Freedman said 49 people, including former tenants, relatives and heirs of the 
16 people who died, have joined the legal actions against his clients. 
</P>
<P>
 A trial to determine whether negligence played a role in the collapse is 
scheduled to begin in March in San Fernando Superior Court. If some or all of 
the defendants, which include the architect, engineers and builder, are found 
liable, a second round of litigation will follow to determine damages.

PROSECUTOR RECOUNTS BRUTALITY IN TRIAL OF ACCUSED KILLERS; CRIME: OPENING 
STATEMENT BEGINS WITH A DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE SLAYINGS OF A MAYWOOD 
POLICE OFFICER AND A VAN NUYS GROCER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A prosecutor told jurors Monday that he could deliver a complete picture of 
the "murderous, torturous" acts performed by a trio of men who are accused of 
killing a Maywood police officer and a Van Nuys grocer during a crime spree. 
</P>
<P>
 Jose Contreras, Benjamin Alberto Navarro and Edgardo Sanchez Fuentes are 
accused of killing Officer John Hoglund. Contreras and Fuentes are also accused 
of killing market owner Lee Chul Kim. The men face as many as 31 charges in 
addition to murder, stemming from seven robberies of markets and restaurants 
from Van Nuys to Paramount. Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty against 
all three. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Michael Grosbard began opening statements Monday with a 
detailed description of the slayings.  
</P>
<P>
 Grosbard told jurors that Fuentes and Contreras confronted Kim in the freezer 
of his store, where he was "crying and pleading for his life." Then the pair 
shot him about a dozen times, the prosecutor said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Hoglund killing, Grosbard said that after the three men robbed George's 
Market in Maywood, they were caught on videotape walking around the store 
drinking Gatorade and "just taking their own sweet time." 
</P>
<P>
 They tried to flee when Hoglund arrived, but as they were leaving Fuentes 
allegedly sneaked up behind Hoglund and shot him twice, Grosbard said. As the 
officer fell to the ground, Fuentes allegedly shot him again in the back of the 
head. 
</P>
<P>
 Grosbard also alleged that during the other robberies, the various defendants 
shoved a gun in one man's mouth and threatened to blow his brains out, 
threatened to cut off a woman's fingers "one by one" and tortured other 
employees with stun guns.  
</P>
<P>
 Customers could hear one waitress' "cries of pain as the stun gun was applied 
to her flesh," Grosbard said. 
</P>
<P>
 A distinctive watch and a black-and-white polka-dot shirt Navarro wore during 
several of the robberies along with pictures of a red Mazda sports car that was 
used as the getaway vehicle in some robberies will also be introduced as 
evidence, Grosbard said. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses during the estimated two-month trial will include Navarro's former 
girlfriend, who will testify that after the Maywood robbery the defendants were 
"just giggling that they had killed the police officer," Grosbard said. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Public Defender James Coady, who represents Fuentes, asked jurors to 
"keep an open mind" when considering prosecution evidence. He conceded that the 
evidence against his client is strong. 
</P>
<P>
 Eric K. Davis, Navarro's attorney, told jurors that while evidence will show 
his client had some involvement in some of the robberies, it will fall short of 
proving he is a murderer or torturer as prosecutors alleged. 
</P>
<P>
 The attorney for Contreras contended that his client killed neither Kim nor 
Hoglund. "Mr. Contreras is a robber, but he is not a killer," defense attorney 
James P. Leonard said.

VALLEY INTERVIEW; DOWNTOWN GLENDALE'S PIGEON PROBLEM DEFIES CHEAP SOLUTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VIVIEN LOU CHEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Downtown Glendale is home to about 10,000 pigeons -- so many that city 
officials are almost at their wits' end over what to do about it. 
</P>
<P>
 Business operators in an area bordered by Glenoaks Boulevard, Colorado Street 
and Central and Maryland avenues complain that pigeon droppings are unsightly 
and may lead to respiratory ailments. 
</P>
<P>
 Animal-rights groups such as People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals have 
opposed virtually every idea considered by Glendale city officials to deal with 
the problem. Proposals they have deemed inhumane are placing the pigeons in 
bags and tying them to an automobile tailpipe, poisoning their food, snaring 
them in a sticky gel or trapping and taking them far away for release. 
</P>
<P>
 One idea approved by animal-rights groups is the use of roosting barriers, or 
strings of metal needles laid along window ledges and other parts of buildings 
where pigeons congregate. But it is also the most expensive proposal, costing 
about $6,000 to line just one side of a block. 
</P>
<P>
 The city has an ordinance that bans pigeon feeding, but it will not be 
enforced until Oct. 17. 
</P>
<P>
 Until then, posters featuring an orange-eyed pigeon staring defiantly at 
passersby are being posted in storefronts as a reminder of the ban. 
</P>
<P>
 Researcher Leslie Gerstenfeld-Press of People for the Ethical Treatment of 
Animals was interviewed from the group's headquarters in Rockville, Md. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Question: City officials in Glendale complain that groups such as yours have 
failed to offer any good, inexpensive alternatives. Can you give me any?  
</P>
<P>
 Answer: Well, there is no inexpensive alternative other than just accepting it 
and trying to cope with the situation as best as possible. There are things 
that Glendale can do to try to minimize the conflict, but it costs money. 
</P>
<P>
 The things we recommend are exclusion, modifying building structures so that 
pigeons are unable to roost on them, which is usually the problem. Pigeons are 
roosting on window ledges, rooftops, awnings. So if you can shift the pigeons 
away from those sites that usually solves the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 There are tapes of bird alarm calls, which is not an ultrasonic device, of the 
species you're interested in frightening off. They're played over a loudspeaker 
when the birds come in. It has to be done every evening for maybe a week before 
the birds finally get the hint. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What do you mean by exclusion?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Birds are excluded from buildings. There are a number of anti-roosting 
devices out there. These are all usually made of metal. They are designed to be 
very unobtrusive. Unless you're really close up to them from street level, you 
shouldn't see them at taller than the second story. They are porcupine wire 
strips. They're installed on window ledges so that the birds aren't able to sit 
there. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How much should the first alternative cost?  
</P>
<P>
 A: That all depends on whether you do it yourself or whether you have a 
professional do it, and the size of the building in question. It can be done as 
inexpensively as possible by purchasing the materials directly from the 
manufacturer and having the city workers do it themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: These options sound like they would require 100% participation from the 
people being affected, and that's something you'll never be able to get.  
</P>
<P>
 A: Someone in the city has said something to me about that, and it really 
seems like a shame since these are the people who are complaining about the 
pigeons. And if they don't want to participate in solving the problem, that 
really seems unfair to their fellow business owners. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Short of Glendale being able to take any action soon, what is PETA's 
official position on pigeons? That they ought to just be left alone?  
</P>
<P>
 A: We really don't believe that any problem warrants exterminating these 
birds. They're not a significant health threat, and it's not worth killing the 
birds. 
</P>
<P>
 We believe if there's a problem you have to take every possible step to solve 
the problem humanely. We would not condone a lethal control program. We would 
say the birds should be left alone. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Why should anyone give 2 cents about a pigeon's life?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Because they are living beings and they can feel pain just like any other 
animal, and we should all care about all other life. We should care about other 
people's lives. We should care about other animals' lives. Really, all they're 
doing is going about their business the way nature intended. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: The city has not ruled out the use of lethal injections, which are not 
supposed to be painful but, of course, would result in death. Is this something 
PETA supports?  
</P>
<P>
 A: No. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How prevalent is the overpopulation of pigeons across the country? How many 
other cities have you dealt with?  
</P>
<P>
 A: (Laughs) I've dealt with dozens of cities. Anyplace where you have a large 
enough city to have quite a number of buildings with ledges and ornate 
detailing, and may have a sanitation problem, you're going to have pigeons. 
</P>
<P>
 In a situation like Glendale, where you are very close to some other major 
cities, eliminating your pigeon population will not be a permanent thing 
because there is no dome covering Glendale. Pigeons from elsewhere will find 
Glendale and will move in. 
</P>
<P>
 Pigeons do this. They have sentinels to go out and look for a better place to 
live. Once they get to a point where they're currently living, if there are too 
many of them, they will look for another place to live. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether it's a serious problem is, of course, in the eye of the beholder. We 
don't think droppings are a serious problem. Droppings can be cleaned up. The 
word problem is really a relative thing. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Is there a city in the United States that has dealt with this 
appropriately?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Washington, D.C., is trying to deal with it. They will not kill the pigeons 
that live in the city. When there is a problem on a specific site, at a 
specific building, the building owners have to take it upon themselves to do 
something about it. But wide-scale poisoning, trapping, gassing, injecting is 
not acceptable in Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the government buildings, in particular, have undergone wide-scale 
pigeon-proofing. Basically, the birds cannot get into the parts of the 
buildings that have (the) roosting spots. Pigeons cannot get in and defecate. 
</P>
<P>
 With the United States Department of Agriculture building, one whole side, I 
believe, cost $100,000. But that's a very large building. 
</P>
<P>
 I've seen many restaurants in town use porcupine wire, a strip of needles, 
along the edge of the roof on the front of the building. And that might cost 
$100 to do one side of the building. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Would a ban on pigeon feeding and 100% compliance from the public be enough 
to send the pigeons away?  
</P>
<P>
 A: It would really do an awful lot to help the situation. Urban pigeons are 
not believed to live longer than a year to three years. If you really 
significantly reduce the amount of food they have available to them, they will 
significantly reduce the amount of offspring they produce and what you will 
find is a gradual decrease in the population of birds. 
</P>
<P>
 We're not saying that if, boom, everybody stops feeding them today and they 
clean up the streets and there's no more trash and there's no more food, 
tomorrow they will all be gone. But gradually, over the next few years, 
Glendale will find its population decreased. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What would PETA do if Glendale took action that your organization doesn't 
approve of?  
</P>
<P>
 A: I couldn't tell you. I'm sure many of our local members would protest.

VENTURA BOULEVARD SENIOR HOUSING PLAN BACKED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HUGO MARTIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Despite strong neighborhood opposition, a Los Angeles City Council panel 
recommended a $2.4-million loan Monday to provide low-income senior citizen 
housing on a Ventura Boulevard commercial lot that has been vacant and blighted 
for nearly six years. 
</P>
<P>
 If the three-story senior housing complex is approved by the entire council in 
November, it would represent the final chapter in a long history of bickering 
and legal haggling among residents, city officials and developers of the lot at 
Woodman Avenue and Ventura Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed 100,000-square-foot complex would mix 84 senior housing units 
with 3,000 square feet of retail shops and would be the first so-called 
mixed-use project along Ventura Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 If approved, demolition of the vacant, graffiti-marred business now on the 
property would begin in December. Construction could be completed as early as 
February, 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 The $2.4-million low-interest loan recommended for approval by the council's 
Housing and Community Redevelopment Committee would help the developer buy the 
property. The developer would then pay for the remainder of the $8-million 
project. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors continued to oppose the project at Monday's meeting, saying it would 
create traffic and parking problems. They also argued that seniors would be in 
danger of being hit by cars while crossing the busy boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ventura Boulevard is just crazy and to do this to seniors is just 
outrageous," longtime neighbor Katherine Little said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other opponents demanded a full environmental review of the project to 
document any problems the complex may create. 
</P>
<P>
 But Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, who represents the Sherman Oaks area, 
criticized the project's opponents, blaming them for holding up development on 
what he called "the ugliest corner in my district." 
</P>
<P>
 City transportation officials say the complex will generate less traffic than 
the previous businesses on that block, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Yaroslavsky also suggested that neighbors oppose the project partly because it 
would house low-income tenants. In fact, the petition circulated by opponents 
includes a headline that reads: "Low-Income Housing Project at Woodman & 
Ventura?" The petition does not mention senior citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents of the project rejected such charges, saying the site is a poor 
choice for any senior housing, regardless of whether it is for low-income or 
wealthy tenants. 
</P>
<P>
 "Housing doesn't belong on Ventura Boulevard, whether it be senior, low-income 
or luxury," said Sherman Oaks neighbor Sally Kaplan. 
</P>
<P>
 Controversy over the site began in 1988 when the landowner abruptly evicted 
all the merchants of the block -- including the popular Scene of the Crime 
bookstore -- to make way for a three-story, 85,000-square-foot building for 
office space and stores but no housing. 
</P>
<P>
 Responding to neighborhood protests, former City Councilman Michael Woo, who 
represented the area at the time, blocked the permits to demolish the vacant 
stores in an attempt to force a full-scale environmental review of the project. 
The developer, Jacky Gamliel, sued but lost in court. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990, Gamliel asked for an exception to the Ventura Boulevard Specific 
Plan, which puts limits on new buildings along the commercial strip from Studio 
City to Woodland Hills. The project would have been too big to comply with the 
plan. 
</P>
<P>
 His request was rejected, and in 1991 Gamliel again sued the city, this time 
challenging the Specific Plan and asking for $10 million in damages. Attorneys 
for the developer said they plan to drop the lawsuit if the city approves the 
development without major alterations.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; VOLUNTEERS DRIVEN TO SPEED, SKID AND SWERVE; 
LAW ENFORCEMENT: EIGHTEEN WHO DONATE TIME TO THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT MANEUVER 
THEIR WAY THROUGH A TRAINING COURSE. 
</P>

 Don't try this on the way home. 
</P>
<P>
 Eighteen ordinary citizens got a taste of thrill-driving Monday, barreling 
through intersections, driving backward at high speeds and flinging their cars 
into wild 360-degree turns. 
</P>
<P>
 They were Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department volunteers, who give their 
time to perform clerical work and other jobs around department stations. 
Because their chores sometimes involve driving, they were asked to take a 
scaled-down version of the two-day driving course given to sheriff's deputies. 
</P>
<P>
 During his two-hour lecture before the volunteers hit the course laid out at 
Fox Airfield, Deputy Rick Frempter noted that numerous orange cones had been 
placed on the driving area to simulate telephone poles and other hazards. 
</P>
<P>
 "You'll know soon why we use cones instead of telephone poles," Frempter said. 
"I guarantee most of you will get a panoramic view of the airfield today." 
</P>
<P>
 The volunteers sped, skidded -- and occasionally swore -- their way through a 
dozen different training exercises. And some of them loved it. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's better than a day at Disneyland," said Rick Lexton, 48, a ham radio 
operator in Lost Hills, as he watched a car make a controlled skid through a 
sheet of water intended to test emergency steering skills. 
</P>
<P>
 There was plenty of frustration as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Brewer, 36, another volunteer from Lost Hills Sheriff's Station, which 
serves the Las Virgenes area, found out the water driving exercise wasn't as 
easy as it looked when he climbed into a patrol car with bald tires. 
</P>
<P>
 He sped several hundred feet across a parking lot before entering the sheet of 
water at 35 m.p.h., ending with an out-of-control 360-degree spin. 
</P>
<P>
 He drove through slower the second time -- too slow for his instructors, even 
though he stayed under control. Faster, he was told. A few more times he tried. 
A few more times he spun out of control. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a confidence builder right now, I'll tell you that," he said after 
his sixth trip through the water, only two of which didn't end in spins. 
</P>
<P>
 But Brewer eventually got a grip on things, and a passing grade, after an 
instructor rode in the car with him a few times. Most other volunteers had 
similar experiences, gaining control of their vehicles after several trips 
through the water. 
</P>
<P>
 Another exercise forced volunteers to avoid two suddenly blocked lanes and 
maneuver into a third "open" lane as they drove through a simulated 
intersection at speeds up to 35 m.p.h. Drivers also practiced driving in 
reverse, maneuvering through slalom courses and a variety of other skills, 
including basics such as parallel parking. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sheriff's Department started training volunteers from all over the county 
last year because of the increasing number who drive police vehicles as part of 
their assignments. The results of the driving tests are sent to the station 
where each volunteer is assigned, and a person who performs poorly could be 
reassigned to a non-driving task. 
</P>
<P>
 Volunteers drive vans, subcompacts and other civilian vehicles owned by the 
department during many assignments, as well as driving a regular patrol car 
from one location for use by deputies at another. Frempter warned volunteers 
that they might have to chase suspects someday -- though that is highly 
unlikely -- or even become targets themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes people start throwing rocks and bottles at vehicles," he said. 
"There are some people out there who don't like law enforcement." 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the driving classes for deputies and volunteers are taught at the 
fairgrounds in Pomona, said Sgt. George Grein, a training bureau supervisor. 
However, the training is moved to Lancaster for a few weeks each year because 
of other events at the fairgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Volunteers at Monday's class ranged from Crystal Perea, 21, a private security 
guard working her first day as a volunteer at the Santa Clarita Valley 
Sheriff's Station, to Hal Ratner, 77, a volunteer since 1989 at the same 
station who -- among other things -- is a retired driving instructor. 
</P>
<P>
 "We never gave anyone instruction like this," he said.

MCDONNELL REACHES OUTSIDE FAMILY FOR CEO; SUNDSTRAND'S STONECIPHER IS CHOICE TO 
HEAD DEFENSE GIANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES F. PELTZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 McDonnell Douglas Corp., choosing a leader outside the McDonnell and Douglas 
families for the first time in its long history, on Monday named Harry C. 
Stonecipher as president and chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
 Stonecipher, 58, has been chairman and chief executive of Sundstrand Corp., an 
Illinois-based maker of aerospace and industrial components. Earlier, he spent 
26 years at General Electric Co., where he headed its aircraft-engines group 
from from 1984 to 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 After the surprising announcement, Stonecipher said in a telephone interview 
that his priorities include enhancing McDonnell Douglas' commercial jetliner 
group and its C-17 military transport program. Both are based in Long Beach, 
and employ a combined 20,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
 He succeeds John F. McDonnell as chief executive, but McDonnell remains 
chairman. McDonnell, 56, is the son of James S. McDonnell, who founded 
McDonnell Aircraft Co. in 1939 and then merged it with Douglas Aircraft Co. in 
1967 to form St. Louis-based McDonnell Douglas. The McDonnell family still owns 
or controls about 13% of the company's stock. 
</P>
<P>
 Stonecipher has been at Sundstrand since 1987, becoming chairman and chief 
executive in 1991. He is credited with engineering a rebound of the 
once-troubled company, which in late 1988 pleaded guilty to fraud for 
overbilling the Defense Department on aircraft parts. 
</P>
<P>
 With $14.5 billion in sales last year, McDonnell Douglas is the nation's 
largest defense contractor, although it will fall to second place after 
Lockheed Corp. and Martin Marietta Corp. complete their proposed merger. 
</P>
<P>
 John McDonnell -- who said he will focus on broad strategic issues while 
Stonecipher runs McDonnell Douglas -- has led the company through several 
turbulent years as it wrestled with dwindling Pentagon contracts and a slumping 
jetliner market. But he has also helped engineer its remarkable financial 
comeback since 1992, thanks in part to massive layoffs and other cost-cutting 
measures. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, there are several nagging problems that Stonecipher must now address, 
including what to do with the company's Douglas Aircraft jetliner division. 
</P>
<P>
 Though marginally profitable, the division is a distant third in its industry 
behind Boeing and Europe's Airbus Industrie. It is struggling to sign new 
orders from the world's airlines and the subject of recurring speculation that 
it will eventually be shut down. 
</P>
<P>
 Stonecipher, however, said flatly that Douglas Aircraft will not be shuttered. 
</P>
<P>
 "Quite the contrary to some of the things you read, we're not in the mode of 
finding out how to close Douglas," he said in the telephone interview, in which 
he was joined by John McDonnell. "We want to grow Douglas." 
</P>
<P>
 Douglas "lost its grip somewhere along the way in terms of marketing" its 
planes, Stonecipher said. "I intend to add energy to the Douglas company, 
revitalizing that business and enhancing its position with the airlines of the 
world." 
</P>
<P>
 For several years, Douglas has searched for a foreign partner to help pay for 
its expansion. Stonecipher, who for many years sold engines to Douglas while he 
was at General Electric, said Douglas no longer needs that cash but would still 
like to find a partner to gain a larger share of the foreign market. 
</P>
<P>
 Stonecipher has several other hurdles to cross. 
</P>
<P>
 One is the C-17, a plane dogged by technical flaws and delays. The Pentagon 
says it won't buy more than 40 of the four-engine jets unless McDonnell Douglas 
proves the problems are over. 
</P>
<P>
 The company's missile business has also emerged as a question mark after it 
lost a $1-billion contest to Hughes Aircraft Co. earlier this month to be sole 
builder of the Navy's Tomahawk missiles. The loss will leave McDonnell Douglas 
with only one major missile program, the Navy's Harpoon. 
</P>
<P>
 And Stonecipher must decide whether McDonnell Douglas itself starts being a 
player, and stops being an observer, in the industry's rush to merge in this 
era of shrinking Pentagon budgets. With its stronger financial condition, 
McDonnell Douglas is considered a prime candidate to buy other defense firms. 
</P>
<P>
 Stonecipher said McDonnell Douglas is evaluating potential purchases, but 
added, "We're not going to be driven (to do deals), like a lemming over the 
shore, just because (other) people are out making acquisitions." 
</P>
<P>
 McDonnell Douglas had searched for a new president since Gerald A. Johnston 
announced his retirement in August, 1993. But John McDonnell's willingness, at 
his relatively young age, to also immediately relinquish the chief executive's 
post to Stonecipher surprised some observers. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the mystery to me," said George D. Shapiro, an analyst at Salomon 
Bros. 
</P>
<P>
 PaineWebber analyst Jack Modzelewski said McDonnell, who has "been more of a 
conceptual guy from day one," apparently decided that with his company 
financially stable again but still facing strategic problems, "an outsider is 
probably appropriate now" to run the firm. 
</P>
<P>
 In the interview, McDonnell said that after "getting the corporation back on 
sound footing," he now wants to "spend more of my time thinking about the 
future," including how to improve McDonnell Douglas' foreign sales. 
</P>
<P>
 McDonnell joined his father's McDonnell Aircraft as an engineer in 1962, 
rising through the ranks until being elected president in 1980 and chief 
operating officer in 1987. He was named chairman and chief executive in 1988. A

GM FACES STRIKE BY 12,000 WORKERS AT HUGE MICHIGAN ASSEMBLY PLANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DONALD W. NAUSS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 About 12,000 workers are set to strike today at General Motors' massive Buick 
City factory complex in Flint, Mich., if the company and union cannot settle a 
dispute about overtime and new hiring. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Buick City not only makes several car models but also key parts for 
numerous GM assembly plants, a strike could quickly shut down most of GM's 
North American vehicle production just as the 1995 model year kicks off. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would certainly be a pretty effective strike on the car side of the 
business," said William Hoglund, GM executive vice president. 
</P>
<P>
 The threatened strike by the United Auto Workers comes as Detroit auto makers 
are running assembly and parts factories at capacity and many employees are 
working 50- to 60-hour weeks to meet demand for cars and trucks. 
</P>
<P>
 The dispute highlights a peculiarity of the current boom in auto sales. In 
past cycles, Detroit met demand by going on hiring and plant-building binges. 
When sales slackened, workers were laid off and plants shut at great cost. 
</P>
<P>
 This time around, the auto makers are producing more vehicles with fewer 
workers and no new factories. 
</P>
<P>
 The result is plants operating to the limit and workers complaining about burn 
out. Just last week, Ford Motor Co. cut back production at two plants when 
workers at an Indianapolis parts facility refused to work overtime. 
</P>
<P>
 The dispute at GM comes as it is paring the ranks of hourly workers to match 
the efficiency of competitors. With the high cost of pensions and health 
benefits, the company said it will not hire new permanent workers. 
</P>
<P>
 But the union says its members are exhausted and that the long hours are 
taking a toll by reducing work quality and increasing injury rates. The UAW 
wants GM to hire hundreds of more full-time employees. 
</P>
<P>
 "Workers are getting tired," said Gary Mattson, recording secretary for UAW 
Local 599 in Flint, noting that some workers have been putting in 10 to 12 
hours a day, seven days a week. 
</P>
<P>
 The labor dispute in Flint is the latest in a series of local disagreements 
that have plagued GM in the last year. The other negotiations largely revolved 
around job security and the use of cheaper, non-union workers to produce parts. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, a strike last month at a parts factory in Anderson, Ind., shut 
down 15 GM assembly plants within three days. 
</P>
<P>
 Other disputes are looming as well. Workers in plants in Toledo, Ohio, and 
Warren, Mich., have authorized strikes although leaders have not yet set 
deadlines for walkouts. Overtime and staff shortages are concerns at both of 
those plants. 
</P>
<P>
 The likelihood of a strike, at least a lengthy one, at Flint is not considered 
high because GM cannot afford to lose sales and cede more market share to other 
auto makers, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
 "GM will cave in because they have to," said David Healy, analyst with S.G. 
Warburg & Co., a New York brokerage. "The union has all the cards because they 
can shut down the company in a couple of days." 
</P>
<P>
 A glimmer of hope that a strike could be averted appeared this weekend when GM 
agreed to hire 118 new full-time workers at its Inland Fisher Guide components 
plant in Flint. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of a cost-cutting effort, GM has reduced its hourly work force by 
15,000 to about 247,000 workers since the beginning of the year. In 1988, when 
the last auto sales boom ended, GM had 373,000 hourly workers. Still, a recent 
study found that GM uses about 25% more manpower to build a car than Ford or 
Chrysler. 
</P>
<P>
 The company this year hired about 7,000 temporary employees to help it meet 
rising demand, but recently let most of them go at the UAW's insistence. 
Instead, the union is demanding that more full-time workers be hired. 
</P>
<P>
 "Greedy employers, as short-sighted as ever, are trying to produce far too 
much product with far too few people," UAW President Owen Bieber complained in 
a speech this month. 
</P>
<P>
 GM wants to move as many as 4,200 laid-off workers from closed plants -- 
including former employees of the closed Van Nuys assembly plant -- to 
factories running at capacity. 
</P>
<P>
 But many of those workers refuse to move, even when offered $60,000 incentive 
packages. 
</P>
<P>
 The company also wants to move more work to outside suppliers who are often 
non-union and can offer wage-and-benefit rates sometimes half the $42 an hour 
that UAW workers receive."We just can't afford that kind of cost structure," 
Hoglund said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Flint complex produces the Buick Park Avenue and LeSabre and the 
Oldsmobile Eighty Eight. In addition, it makes engines and key chassis and 
transmission components used in most of GM's U.S. and Canadian assembly plants.

COMPANY TOWN; NO TELECOM BILL MEANS STATES, COURTS MUST SORT OUT ISSUES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE HELM, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Congress's failure to pass a comprehensive telecommunications reform bill this 
year will mean plenty of extra work for state regulators and the courts as they 
retain responsibility for an array of high-stakes telecom issues -- all of 
which feature powerful industry factions with diametrically opposed interests. 
</P>
<P>
 Take the question of whether or not regional phone companies should be allowed 
to offer their own video programming in competition with cable TV firms. The 
Bell companies say they need those rights to justify making the huge 
investments necessary to link schools and hospitals with high-capacity lines 
and to offer such services as video-on-demand. Cable TV firms and other 
opponents counter that phone customers will end up subsidizing such ventures, 
and that the Bells will freeze out independent program providers. 
</P>
<P>
 Three courts have found in favor of the Bells on First Amendment grounds, 
ruling that the bar on programming interferes with the phone companies' 
free-speech rights. But two of the cases are under appeal and at least five 
more cases on the same issue are pending. 
</P>
<P>
 The failed federal legislation would have put an end to the legal bickering. 
Now, at least one of the cases seems headed for the Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
 Or consider competition in local and long-distance phone markets. A call 
within a regional calling area, known as a LATA, is typically handled by the 
local Bell company -- even if it's to a location hundreds of miles away. (These 
longer intra-LATA calls are known as local long distance, or toll calls.) A 
call between LATAs is a long-distance call. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed telecom reform bill would have required states to open up the 
intra-LATA market to competition. Now the battle between long-distance carriers 
and local phone companies that was fought on Capital Hill must be replayed in 
each state, with often-underequipped public utility commissions trying to sort 
through the issues. 
</P>
<P>
 The same applies for competition in local phone service -- a business cable 
operators and long-distance carriers are eager to be in. Although four states 
have stripped the local carriers of their legal monopolies and invited 
competition -- and eight others are expected to do so within a year -- many 
states are dragging their feet. And none have determined how they will handle 
the sticky issue of subsidizing basic phone services -- which local carriers 
have traditionally done with their monopoly profits. 
</P>
<P>
 Nick Allard, a Washington attorney who deals with telecom regulations, is 
optimistic that the efficiency of having a single national policy will 
ultimately carry the day as the issue is taken up again by Congress next year. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is really a lot of consensus" on the need for federal rules, he says. 
"It would have been better for everyone to have a rational system instead of 
this crazy quilt of outdated regulations." Telecom Regulation: A Status Report 
</P>
<P>
 An effort to rewrite the nation's telecommunications laws died in the Senate 
on Friday. Without new federal laws, many vital issues remain the province of 
state regulators and the courts. 
</P>
<P>
 LOCAL PHONE SERVICE: 
</P>
<P>
 * An $80-billion market controlled by local monopolies. 
</P>
<P>
 Current Rules: New York, Illinois, Massachusetts, and Washington now allow 
competitors -- notably cable TV and long-distance companies -- to challenge 
regional Bell operating companies or other monopoly local carriers. Eight more 
states will allow competition next year, and California will do so by January, 
1997. 
</P>
<P>
 Key Issues: Potential competitors say customers must be able to change 
companies without changing phone numbers. Measures are required to prevent 
Bells from exploiting their monopoly position. Arrangements are needed to cover 
subsidies for universal service, anywhere from $4 billion to $20 billion 
annually. 
</P>
<P>
 LOCAL LONG DISTANCE (TOLL): 
</P>
<P>
 * A $14-billion market dominated by Bell companies. 
</P>
<P>
 Current Rules: There is open competition in 43 states. California will allow 
competition beginning Jan 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Key Issues: Long-distance providers say they cannot be competitive if 
customers must use special access codes, as will be the case in California. 
Competition lowers prices but local carriers boost the cost of basic phone 
service to make up revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 LONG DISTANCE: 
</P>
<P>
 * A $60-billion market dominated by MCI, Sprint and AT&T. 
</P>
<P>
 Current Rules: Regional Bell companies are barred from the market by the court 
order governing the breakup of the Bell system. 
</P>
<P>
 Key Issues: Bell companies contend their entry into the market would enhance 
competition and are mounting a legal challenge to the court order. 
</P>
<P>
 CABLE: 
</P>
<P>
 * A $20-billion market controlled by local monopolies in most places. 
</P>
<P>
 Current Rules: Bell companies are barred from owning cable companies where 
they provide phone service. 
</P>
<P>
 Key Issues: Bell Atlantic won the right to carry video signals to homes in 
Dover Township, N.J., and is applying for the right to offer video programming 
as well. Other Bell companies have a total of 27 applications with the FCC to 
offer cable-type services. District courts in Alabama, Washington and Virginia, 
citing free-speech concerns, have overturned provisions of the Cable Act of 
1984 barring Bell ownership of cable programming sold in their own regions. 
Cases are on appeal. At least five other court challenges on the same issue are 
pending.

PILGRIM FUNDS CEO WINS CUT IN PENALTIES OVER AD CASE; ETHICS: NASD REBUKES ITS 
LOS ANGELES CONDUCT COMMITTEE IN SCALING BACK SUSPENSION AND FINE AGAINST 
PALOMBA WEINGARTEN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM PETRUNO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Pilgrim Group Chief Executive Palomba Weingarten has won a sharp reduction in 
penalties ordered against her and her Century City-based mutual fund firm for a 
series of fund ads that an industry watchdog group judged misleading. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Assn. of Securities Dealers' national business conduct committee, 
in a decision released Monday in Washington, ordered that a one-year suspension 
and $100,000 fine levied against Weingarten be cut to three months and $25,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The penalties had been assessed by the NASD's regional business conduct 
committee in Los Angeles after an investigation into Pilgrim ads that ran in 
the Wall Street Journal in early 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 The regional NASD committee found that the ads contained "misleading or 
exaggerated statements" about the performance of some Pilgrim funds, and that 
Weingarten's conduct "was intentional" in creating the ads. 
</P>
<P>
 But the national NASD committee, to which Weingarten appealed the regional 
group's decision, said that the penalties were "unprecedented in their 
severity." 
</P>
<P>
 "It is clear to us that in no prior case has the NASD imposed sanctions for 
advertising violations that were even remotely of the magnitude of those 
imposed in this case," the national committee wrote in its decision. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the decision does not overturn the regional committee's findings on 
the ads. "We share the view . . . that the ads in question were egregious, and 
that respondents acted recklessly (if not intentionally)" in creating the ads, 
the national committee said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pilgrim case garnered widespread publicity because mutual fund advertising 
in general has come under scrutiny since 1992, and because the often brash and 
outspoken Weingarten has become a controversial industry figure. 
</P>
<P>
 Pilgrim, which manages mostly bond funds that invest in adjustable-rate 
mortgages, has been embroiled in a number of disputes over its funds in recent 
years. Most recently, the company reimbursed one of its funds for consultant 
fees charged to the fund but later judged inappropriate. 
</P>
<P>
 Weingarten, whose lawyers had argued in their appeal that the regional NASD 
committee had been overzealous and unfair in affixing the original penalties, 
said Monday that "the fact that the national committee saw fit to reduce them 
by 75% indicates that they also felt (the regional board) was overreaching." 
</P>
<P>
 While still insisting that the ads "were not meant to be misleading," the 
51-year-old Weingarten said she will not appeal the case further. "I will go 
forward with my business," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Her suspension affects only her association with Pilgrim's funds distribution 
arm, not her position as CEO of the parent company. In August, Weingarten 
stepped down as CEO of the distribution unit, naming James Ash to succeed her. 
</P>
<P>
 Weingarten now must take a standard NASD written test to requalify as a 
securities "principal." 
</P>
<P>
 Lani M. Sen Woltmann, the NASD district director in Los Angeles, said that 
while regional NASD committees are supposed to follow national guidelines in 
setting penalties, "They're permitted to go up or down" from the guidelines 
depending on the case. 
</P>
<P>
 But the national NASD committee, in its rebuke, said the $100,000 fine 
originally ordered against Weingarten was "four times the maximum" in the 
guidelines and "cannot be justified." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the latest blaze of bad publicity surrounding Pilgrim and 
Weingarten may be taking its toll. The firm, which relies on brokers to sell 
its funds, had $2.5 billion in assets in late July, but now says the total is 
$2.2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Although some fund analysts believe Pilgrim is too small to compete 
effectively in the industry, Weingarten said Monday: "I've been hearing that 
for 10 years."

 The death of health care reform efforts this year may deal an unexpected blow 
to millions of self-employed Americans, who are now expected to lose -- at 
least temporarily -- a lucrative tax deduction for health insurance expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 The lost deduction, which allowed self-employed individuals to deduct up to 
25% of the cost of their health insurance premiums, could force them to pay 
hundreds of dollars in additional taxes or cancel their coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a crime," said John Motley, vice president for government affairs of the 
National Federation of Independent Business. "Not only is there no health care 
reform, but we lost even the very meager incentive that small, self-employed 
people had to purchase health insurance." 
</P>
<P>
 Corporations can deduct 100% of the cost of providing insurance for their 
employees. However, self-employed people cannot. Their health insurance 
premiums are considered personal expenditures, not business expenses, so their 
deductions have been severely limited. In past years, self-employed workers 
were allowed to deduct up to 25% of the cost of their health insurance 
premiums. But the provision in the federal Tax Code that allowed this deduction 
expired at the end of 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawmakers in both parties had expected to restore it and provide an even more 
generous break this year as part of health reform. 
</P>
<P>
 Many health care reform bills -- including those of President Clinton and 
Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.) -- proposed giving the self-employed a 
100% tax deduction, for example. However, other health care reform measures 
were not as generous, limiting the deduction to between 50% and 80% of health 
insurance expenses. Expanding the deduction proved troublesome because it was 
expensive. 
</P>
<P>
 The 25% tax deduction, which applied to insurance bought for self-employed 
workers, their spouses and dependents, cost the Treasury about $500 million a 
year. Expanding it to 100% would cost $2.5 billion a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Some experts maintain that the loss of this deduction could prove 
debilitating. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 12 million Americans are self-employed for part or all of their 
lives. And almost 3 million -- or a quarter of that group -- have no health 
insurance, according to the Employee Benefit Research Institute. 
</P>
<P>
 A study conducted last year by the National Assn. for the Self-Employed 
predicted that 400,000 more self-employed would go without insurance if they 
lost the 25% tax deduction. 
</P>
<P>
 Several lawmakers, including Reps. Fred Grandy (R-Iowa) and Jan Meyers 
(R-Kan.), are pushing bills to revive the 25% tax deduction. However, some 
legislative experts maintain the chances of getting it through in the next few 
weeks -- before the current legislative session ends -- are slim. 
</P>
<P>
 It's possible that the deduction will be reinstated next year, but if Congress 
waits until after the April 15 tax filing deadline, it would create headaches 
for anyone hoping to claim it. 
</P>
<P>
 The self-employed health care deduction expired in mid-1992, for example, but 
wasn't reinstated until mid-1993. As a result, millions of Americans were 
entitled to refunds, but because the time and expense of amending their returns 
was often substantial, some experts maintain that only a fraction of those due 
refunds actually claimed them. 
</P>
<P>
 The 25% deduction is worth $280 a year to a self-employed person in the 28% 
tax bracket who spends $4,000 a year on health insurance. 
</P>

 Banking Regulators Issue New Rules: The new regulations are the first 
top-to-bottom overhaul in 17 years of the rules requiring commercial banks and 
savings institutions to serve minorities and poor people.A Clinton 
Administration regulator said the new rules stressed performance over paperwork 
but at least one agency predicted more paperwork for many bankers. And 
activists complained that the government let bankers talk regulators into 
watering down an earlier version of the rules. The four agencies overseeing 
banks and savings institutions released the regulations for enforcing the 
Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 for 45 days of public comment. If approved 
in final form, they would take full effect July 1, 1996.

 Barnett Banks to Buy EquiCredit: Barnett Banks Inc. said it will buy consumer 
finance company EquiCredit Corp. for $332 million in cash, sending EquiCredit's 
stock up sharply.The purchase advances Barnett's plan to raise revenue and 
market share by reaching beyond traditional banking into home mortgages, small 
and mid-sized business lending and fee-producing financial services by buying 
regional or national franchises, Jacksonville, Fla.-based Barnett said. 
EquiCredit, also based in Jacksonville but with 89 offices in 29 states, makes 
fixed-rate consumer loans secured by home mortgages. EquiCredit stock jumped 
$4.875 in Nasdaq trading to close at a 52-week high of $29.50.

 Baby Bell Hires Microsoft, Lockheed for Two-Way TV: Southwestern Bell Corp. 
said Microsoft Corp. and Lockheed Corp. will help with an experiment in two-way 
television.The three companies hope to start offering two-way services, such as 
movies-on-demand, to about 2,500 homes in the Dallas suburb of Richardson late 
next year. For the experiment in Richardson, Southwestern Bell must win a 
challenge to a law prohibiting a company from offering video services in the 
same area it does local telephone service. Three other regional phone companies 
have already won such rulings. The trial must also win Federal Communications 
Commission approval.

MORE BIG FIRMS CUT JOBS DESPITE ECONOMY'S RISE; EMPLOYMENT: NUMBER OF LAYOFFS 
GENERALLY SHRINKING, STUDY FINDS. COMPANIES ARE ALSO ADDING JOBS IN OTHER 
DIVISIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 More big companies cut jobs over the past year, despite the improved economy, 
but the cutbacks themselves generally grew smaller, a new survey shows. 
</P>
<P>
 In a hopeful sign for workers, the survey also found that many companies 
cutting positions in one part of their businesses are offsetting the pain by 
adding jobs elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, amid new indications that "downsizing" is paying off in improved 
profits for many employers, even more firms plan to eliminate positions in the 
coming year. 
</P>
<P>
 The American Management Assn. survey, which polled 713 major U.S. companies 
with an estimated 2.6 million workers, showed that 47.3% of the firms 
eliminated positions from mid-1993 through mid-1994. That was up from 46.6% in 
the previous 12 months. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the 82 California-based employers included in the survey, the increase 
was bigger, with 57.3% cutting jobs in the most recent period, compared to 
47.3% the year before. 
</P>
<P>
 The reasons most often cited for the cutbacks involved anticipated or ongoing 
business downturns. But for the first time in five years, fewer than half of 
the employers gave that as their rationale. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, employers increasingly are making sharply focused layoffs during good 
times or bad to fine-tune their operations, said Eric Greenberg, the AMA's 
research director. He said these job eliminations reflect a trend in corporate 
America toward slashing payrolls down to "absolute, irreducible cores of 
permanent employees." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, 25.8% of employers said they expected to cut jobs in the coming 
year. Since companies normally underestimate layoffs, researchers figure that 
about twice as many firms actually will make cutbacks. By comparison, at the 
same time last year, 21.6% of the companies anticipated layoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 While continuing cutbacks have made American workers increasingly insecure 
about their jobs, there were signs that things are getting a little better for 
employees. For instance, the combination of smaller layoffs and increased 
hiring meant that the net reduction in employment over the last year was 5.2% 
among the companies surveyed, versus 8.4% the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
 Employers, for their part, could take heart in a finding that 50.6% of the 
companies that have cut staff since 1989 have netted higher profits, a somewhat 
brighter finding than discovered in other surveys. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, a study released last October by the Wyatt Co. consulting firm 
found that only 46% of the companies it surveyed boosted their profits by 
cutting employment. 
</P>
<P>
 Both the AMA study and the Wyatt survey found that cutbacks work best when 
they are part of continuing programs, rather than one-time efforts, to reduce 
costs and boost productivity. 
</P>
<P>
 The AMA survey also reflected the hammering California has taken from big 
layoffs by major companies. Among the California-based companies in the survey 
with more than 10,000 employees, staffs were down an average of 13.4% from 
their level of January, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 By comparison, work forces at the biggest companies nationwide were down only 
0.3% over the same period. "No wonder you guys are having so many problems," 
Greenberg said. Triggers for Downsizing 
</P>
<P>
 Actual business downturns or anticipated slowdowns were the main reason 
employers cut staff from mid-1993 to mid-1994 but, increasingly, other factors 
also played a role. 03,43,10,12 Reasons National California Business downturn 
(actual or anticipated) 48.7% 55.3% Increased staff productivity 41.5% 38.3% 
Transfer of work to other locations 20.5% 27.7% Merger or acquisition 13.4% 
19.2% Automation or other new technology 13.7% 17.0% Plant obsolescence 3.0% 
6.4% Totals exceed 100% due to multiple answers

CORAM UNIT TO PAY $500,000, CUT ITS DOCTOR PARTNERSHIPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 In what could be an important precedent for the federal government in its 
efforts to enforce anti-kickback laws in the medical industry, a unit of a 
Newport Beach home infusion company said Monday that it has agreed to pay 
$500,000 to end a federal probe of its financial relations with doctors. 
</P>
<P>
 To settle fraud charges brought by the U.S. Department of Health and Human 
Services, T2 Medical Inc., an Atlanta-based unit of Coram Healthcare Corp. of 
Newport Beach that supplies intravenous drugs and nutrients to patients in 
their homes, agreed to change many of its business practices. 
</P>
<P>
 Without admitting wrongdoing, T2 Medical agreed to stop managing 
physician-owned entities except on a limited basis; stop offering doctors 
preferred deals on company stock, and avoid participating in any partnership 
with doctors in any business providing home infusion. 
</P>
<P>
 The probe focused on whether T2 Medical, which operates in more than 100 
cities and 38 states, was in effect paying doctors for referring patients to T2 
Medical centers in which they had a financial stake. Payment for patient 
referrals is illegal for companies and individuals receiving reimbursements 
under the federal Medicaid and Medicare programs. 
</P>
<P>
 The T2 settlement "is far-reaching and precedent setting," said Ross 
Stromberg, an attorney who specializes in health care cases at the law firm 
Jones Day Reavis & Pogue in Los Angeles. "The federal government is attempting 
to give notice to the field to be extremely cautious in business arrangements 
with physicians. It will have a chilling effect on what companies are doing." 
</P>
<P>
 James M. Sweeney, Coram's chairman and chief executive, said Monday that T2 
Medical has already stopped forming the types of partnerships outlined in the 
agreement with the federal agency and that Coram will have repurchased all 
doctor stakes in the centers by December.

KODAK OKS AUCTIONING OF ITS HOUSEHOLD PRODUCTS UNIT; REORGANIZATION: SALE TO 
BRITAIN'S RECKITT WILL RAISE $1.55 BILLION FOR COMPANY REFOCUSING ON CORE 
IMAGING BUSINESS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Eastman Kodak Co. moved closer to selling the rest of its non-photographic 
businesses on Monday, agreeing to auction the company's household products unit 
to Britain's Reckitt & Colman for $1.55 billion in cash. 
</P>
<P>
 The subsidiary, part of Kodak's L&F Products unit, includes such familiar 
brands such as Lysol cleaners, Mop & Glo floor polish, Resolve carpet cleaner 
and Wet Ones moist towelettes. 
</P>
<P>
 Reckitt, itself a major household products company in the United States and 
Britain, produces Easy Off oven cleaner, French's mustard, Woolite clothes 
detergent and Air Wick air fresheners. 
</P>
<P>
 The sale is part of a reorganization Kodak announced in May when it put its 
health care and consumer products businesses up for sale. 
</P>
<P>
 Those units were acquired in an ill-fated attempt at diversification in the 
1980s that has left Kodak plagued with high debt and several years of weak 
profits. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, the firm is refocusing on its main businesses of photography and 
electronic imaging. 
</P>
<P>
 "This transaction takes us much closer to our strategic goal of total 
dedication and resource commitment to our core imaging businesses," said Kodak 
Chairman and Chief Executive George Fisher, in a statement echoing comments he 
has made after similar deals were announced this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 For Reckitt, the purchase allows a major expansion into the United States and 
makes the company one of the world's leading household products makers. 
</P>
<P>
 The business it's buying, known as L&F Household, had $775 million in revenue 
last year and about $119 million in profits from operations, before taxes. It 
is based in Montvale, N.J., and has operations in Canada, Germany, Australia 
and Southeast Asia, with about 2,400 employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Reckitt expressed interest in the business bought shortly after Kodak 
announced the divestiture program, said Charles Smith, a Kodak spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 It bested several other companies in a sealed-bid auction. 
</P>
<P>
 Like previous deals the price was at the high end of analysts expectations. It 
brings the total of Kodak's sales this year to $7.17 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 In June, Kodak sold the prescription drug business of its Sterling Winthrop 
division to French pharmaceutical company Elf Sanofi for $1.68 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 In August, it sold Sterling's non-prescription business including Bayer 
Aspirin, to Britain's SmithKline Beecham for $2.9 billion. SmithKline later 
sold the North American portion of that business to Germany's Bayer. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this month, Kodak sold its medical diagnostics business to Johnson & 
Johnson for $1.01 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Kodak shares closed unchanged Monday at $52.625 on the New York Stock 
Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 Reckitt will pay for the acquisition with new debt and a new stock offering in 
Britain.

 Sales of Existing Homes Decline: Sales of existing homes fell 1.8% in August, 
the National Assn. of Realtors reported, a decrease it said was too slight to 
imply that the housing market is headed for a slowdown.August sales fell to a 
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.9 million units from a revised 3.97 
million in July. Wall Street economists had expected August sales of 3.92 
million. Compared with a year ago, August sales rose 1% from an annual rate of 
3.86 million units. The real estate group previously reported July sales at a 
3.95 million annual rate.

 Doctors Mull Forming HMO: The California Medical Assn., a professional group 
representing 37,000 doctors, is in talks with Wausau Insurance Cos., of Wausau, 
Wisc., about forming a statewide physician-run health maintenance organization. 
CMA spokesman Paul Moreno said there is widespread dissatisfaction among 
doctors about the growing influence that for-profit HMOs and other managed care 
companies are having on their professional lives.The plan, to be called 
California Health Care, would include a statewide network of physicians that 
would seek contracts with large regional and statewide employers. The 
organization "will be philosophically dedicated to maximizing the percentage of 
(insurance premium dollars) spent on the delivery of health care and minimizing 
the percentage spent on administration and overhead," said Dr. Ronald P. 
Bangasser, president of the group. The CMA and Wausau hope to decide within 60 
days whether to go forward with the project, he said.

BANKAMERICA TO ACQUIRE ARBOR NATIONAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 BankAmerica Corp., the nation's second-largest banking company, said Monday it 
will acquire Arbor National Holdings Inc., a financially troubled New York 
mortgage bank, in a deal valued at about $118 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The surprisingly low price stunned Wall Street, triggering a wave of selling 
in the stock of Arbor and other mortgage companies, whose lending business has 
plunged as interest rates shot up this year. 
</P>
<P>
 BankAmerica's offer was worth far less than the market price of Arbor's stock 
on Friday, prompting a selloff that left the shares off $4.25 to close at 
$15.75 in Nasdaq trading Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 BankAmerica shares slid 12.5 cents to $45.875 on the New York Stock Exchange.  
</P>
<P>
 Arbor National, based in Uniondale, N.Y., on Long Island, is the nation's 
42nd-largest mortgage lender and one of the 100 largest mortgage servicers. It 
collects loan payments from borrowers to pass on to investors for a lucrative 
fee. 
</P>
<P>
 As interest rates have soared this year, mortgage banks' business has 
declined, leading to heavy discounting on new loans and an estimated loss at 
Arbor of $4.5 million to $5.5 million in its second quarter, which ended Aug. 
31.

COMPANY TOWN; COLUMBIA TRISTAR VIDEO ANNOUNCES DEAL TO DISTRIBUTE IN FORMER 
SOVIET UNION; MOVIES: THE VENTURE WITH VARUS VIDEO HOPES TO CUT INTO THE MARKET 
FOR ILLEGALLY COPIED FEATURE FILMS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 In an effort to reach millions of film lovers in the former Soviet Union, 
Columbia TriStar Home Video announced a deal here Monday to distribute its 
tapes throughout Russia, the Baltics, and the Commonwealth of Independent 
States. 
</P>
<P>
 In association with Varus Video, a Russian-Greek joint venture, Columbia 
TriStar will be releasing Columbia, TriStar and Orion Pictures feature films, 
along with the foreign and independent movies distributed by those companies. 
</P>
<P>
 Sales in the venture's first year could approach a million video-cassettes, 
said Christopher Deering, Columbia TriStar's executive vice president. 
</P>
<P>
 Columbia TriStar hopes that by offering high-quality tapes, with lip-synced 
dubbing in the local language, video-happy consumers in the former Soviet Union 
will eschew cheaper, illegal copies. 
</P>
<P>
 Russians imported 64 million blank videocassettes last year, 90% of which were 
used to make illegal copies of movies, said Chris Abel-Smith, managing director 
of Varus Video. Varus is also the distributor for Warner Home Video, the 
division of Warner Brothers that began distributing its videos in the former 
Soviet Union in February. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a very receptive market," Deering said. "We are getting inquiries, 
unsolicited, from all over, from stores (that) want to be in legal business 
with high-quality products." 
</P>
<P>
 Video pirating has been so severe that the Motion Picture Export Assn. of 
America imposed a boycott on the Russian market in June, 1991. The ban was 
lifted in January, 1993, after Russia founded an intellectual property agency 
and drafted laws to control the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the government's effort to crack down on the problem, illegally copied 
videos can be bought for 9,000 to 15,000 rubles ($3.72 to $6.20 at the current 
exchange rate) in virtually every street kiosk in Russia. They include copies 
made from laser discs, duplicates of promotional copies and "rag copies" -- 
those shot with a video camera in a movie theater right off the screen. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can now respectfully ask for enforcement, now that we're officially in the 
marketplace, whereas, before, people could always say we have no choice but to 
pirate cassettes or to buy pirated cassettes, because it was the only thing on 
the marketplace," explained Ben Feingold, president of Columbia TriStar Home 
Video. 
</P>
<P>
 Columbia TriStar releases -- including "Platoon," "The Fisher King" and 
"Flatliners" -- went on sale Monday for 25,000 rubles ($10.32). Tapes will be 
sold to individuals -- an estimated 8 million Russian households have video 
players -- and to video rental stores.

REGIONAL ROUNDUP: TELEDYNE SELECTED TO WORK ON COMPUTER PROTOTYPE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Teledyne Electronic Systems, a Northridge-based maker of electronic navigation 
and communication systems, said it has been selected by a federal Department of 
Defense research agency to design and build a high-performance computer 
prototype. 
</P>
<P>
 The computer would perform a variety of military functions, including 
processing radar readings, identifying targets and scanning for intelligible 
radio signals. 
</P>
<P>
 The Advanced Research Projects Agency, a Defense Department agency that

REGIONAL ROUNDUP: REXON COLORADO CENTER REPLACES IRVINE FACILITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rexon Inc., a Simi Valley-based producer of software and computer data-storage 
systems, said it has opened an engineering center in Longmont, Colo. for its 
Wangtek and WangDAT tape-drive products. 
</P>
<P>
 The Colorado center will replace the company's Irvine facility, which is 
scheduled to be closed early next month.The move is part of a broad 
restructuring effort launched by Rexon last year, when the company reported a 
loss of $53 million amid fierce pricing competition. 
</P>
<P>
 The Irvine facility employed about 60 workers a year ago, the company said. 
About a third of the employees were transferred to Simi Valley; another third 
-- mostly engineers -- have accepted positions at the new Colorado facility. 
The remaining third were laid off or left voluntarily, the company said.

REGIONAL ROUNDUP: COMMENT SOUGHT ON BLUE CROSS PROPOSAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The state Department of Corporations said it is seeking public comment on the 
proposal by create a new public charity. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Woodland Hills-based Blue Cross spun off most of its nonprofit 
health insurance programs into a new for-profit subsidiary, Wellpoint Health 
Networks.Blue Cross retained an 80% ownership stake in Wellpoint, and state 
regulators and consumer advocates have argued that Blue Cross should compensate 
the public for the tax-exempt status it had enjoyed while it built its health 
insurance business. 
</P>
<P>
 Blue Cross responded on Sept. 15, when it unveiled a plan to create a new 
public charity with assets of more than $2 billion to fund health programs 
throughout the state. That plan is subject to review by the Department of 
Corporations. 
</P>
<P>
 The department asks that public comments concerning the plan be submitted in 
writing by 5 p.m. on Oct. 31 to the Office of the Commissioner, Department of 
Corporations, 3700 Wilshire Blvd., Los Angeles, 90010.

BATTLING TO BE TOP DOG IN A FINICKY BUSINESS; PET FOOD: GLENDALE-BASED NESTLE 
USA GAINS SHARE IN A STAGNANT MARKET, HASTENING THE CLUTTERED INDUSTRY'S TREND 
TOWARD CONSOLIDATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG MILLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For decades in the pet food industry, companies battled for market share in 
relatively polite fashion, as industry giants such as Ralston Purina, Nestle 
and Mars behaved like well-mannered dogs gathered around a heaping bowl of 
chow. 
</P>
<P>
 But the market has changed considerably in recent years. Competition from 
high-priced premium brands has intensified, grocery stores have lost pet food 
sales to alternative outlets, and growth in the pet population has slowed. 
Suddenly, there are too many dogs competing for too little chow. 
</P>
<P>
 With tensions rising, analysts say, expect skirmishes, and look for the big 
dogs to survive. 
</P>
<P>
 Nestle USA Inc., the Glendale-based maker of Friskies and Mighty Dog pet 
foods, started bulking up last week when it agreed to acquire Alpo Petfoods 
from London-based Grand Metropolitan for $510 million in cash. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1988, Nestle's share of the $8.4-billion pet food industry has fallen 
from 12.7% to 11.5%. The purchase of Alpo would make Nestle top dog, surpassing 
by 0.1% the 17% market share held by longtime industry leader Ralston Purina. 
And it will give Nestle a popular dog food brand to augment its already strong 
cat food sales. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts applauded the deal as a much-needed closing of the ranks, but said 
there's plenty of room for further consolidation. In the not-so-distant future, 
analysts said, many companies will have to decide whether to join Nestle in 
building up or Grand Met in getting out. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would seem logical to expect more deals in the future," said Les Pugh, a 
pet-food industry analyst at Salomon Brothers in New York. "There are too many 
players, and too much money invested in too many factories with too much 
distribution." 
</P>
<P>
 The winnowing-out process could take years, Pugh said, but eventually the pet 
food industry ought to look a bit more like the $8-billion breakfast cereal 
industry, in which three companies -- Kellogg, General Mills and Post -- hold a 
combined 80% market share in the United States. In contrast, the top three pet 
food companies -- Nestle, Ralston and Mars, the maker of Kal Kan -- together 
account for 46% of domestic sales. 
</P>
<P>
 Such fragmentation has persisted for decades because companies such as Nestle 
had little incentive to unload or expand pet food divisions that typically 
required little attention while producing steady revenue growth. But the pet 
food market has been upended over the past 10 years by a number of forces, 
including the emergence of long-dormant premium brands that have gobbled up 
huge chunks of market share. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill's Pet Nutrition Inc., for example, was barely a blip on industry radar a 
decade ago. But by last year, the company had $660 million in sales and an 
almost 8% market share, much of it gained at the expense of Ralston Purina, 
Nestle and others. 
</P>
<P>
 What happened? Some say the fitness craze finally hit pets. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Hill's is one of several so-called premium pet food brands that claim to be 
more nutritious than traditional brands because they contain higher-quality 
grains and fewer fillers and animal byproducts. But nutrition comes at a hefty 
price. At Big Al's, a large pet supply store in Granada Hills, a 40-pound bag 
of Hill's Science Diet dog food typically sells for about $25, compared to just 
$12 for an equal amount of Purina Dog Chow. 
</P>
<P>
 Until recently, most consumers, and even many veterinarians, saw little reason 
to spend the extra money. But today, "you've got people more concerned about 
their own diet, and that transfers to their pet," said Tim Phillips, a 
veterinarian who is editor of the Pet Food Industry magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill's, a unit of Colgate-Palmolive Co., has emerged as the leading premium 
brand partly by capitalizing on a relationship with veterinarians the company 
has cultivated since 1948, when it introduced its Prescription Diet foods for 
animals with heart or kidney disease. Until a few years ago, Hill's sold 
virtually all of its food through veterinarians, who pocketed up to one-third 
of the sales price on each bag or can. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, even though Hill's is now sold mostly through pet stores, its Science 
Diet brand is widely recommended by veterinarians, and health-conscious 
consumers are following doctors' orders. 
</P>
<P>
 Iams, another premium brand, has similarly capitalized on its status as a 
favorite among breeders, from whom many Americans get their puppies or kittens. 
Tiny 10 years ago, Iams had 1993 sales of $350 million, and held a 4.1% market 
share. 
</P>
<P>
 Ralston Purina, Nestle and other major pet food makers have introduced their 
own premium brands in recent years. But sales of those products have foundered, 
partly because these companies lack credentials with veterinarians and breeders 
and also because they have been shut out by specialty retailers. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the past 10 years, grocery stores have watched their share of retail pet 
food sales in the United States slip from 95% to 55%, said John Maxwell, an 
analyst at Wheat First Securities in Richmond, Va. That's bad news for Ralston, 
Nestle and other industry leaders who have traditionally relied almost 
exclusively on grocery store sales. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Mass merchandisers, including Price Club, Wal-Mart and Costco, have picked up 
some of the business. In fact, Wal-Mart has acquired almost 6% of the retail 
pet food market through sales of its in-house brand, Ol' Roy, named for the dog 
of the late Wal-Mart founder, Sam Walton. Also, as much as a quarter of all pet 
food is now purchased through burgeoning pet shop chains, some of which refuse 
to carry grocery store brands. 
</P>
<P>
 Petco, the second-largest U.S. pet store chain, has nearly doubled in size 
from 115 stores in 1988 to 205 stores today, and not one of them carries 
Nestle, Ralston Purina or other grocery store brands. 
</P>
<P>
 "We threw them out to differentiate ourselves," said Brian Devine, chief 
executive of San Diego-based Petco. Instead, the company serves as an outlet 
for premium brands that aren't available at grocery stores, including Hill's, 
Iams, Nutro and others. 
</P>
<P>
 The outlook for Nestle, Ralston Purina and others has been further hampered by 
signs that the pet population is not growing as fast as it once did. Since 
1990, the number of pet dogs in the United States has remained unchanged at 
about 54.2 million, said Geri Mitchell of the Pet Information Bureau in 
Washington. Meanwhile, the number of pet cats has actually fallen from 60.3 
million to 59.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
 So analysts said that more consolidation is inevitable. Quaker Oats Co. is 
rumored to be looking for a buyer for its pet food division, which makes Cycle 
and Kibbles 'N Bits dog food. Dozens of regional companies with tiny market 
shares are also considered acquisition targets. 
</P>
<P>
 Likely suitors include the large and well-known food producers that must find 
ways to regain lost ground. Like Nestle, other industry heavyweights have seen 
their shares of total pet food sales decline: Ralston Purina's has slipped from 
27.2% in 1998 to 17%; Mars has fallen from 10.7% to 8.8%. Even with Alpo, 
Nestle has already signaled it may still have some shopping to do. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are continually looking for opportunities to grow our business," said Joe 
Weller, chief executive of Nestle USA, "whether through new products or 
acquisitions."

STRUGGLING TO MEASURE UP; RETAILING: AILING HOUSE OF FABRICS IS HOPING TO TURN 
ITSELF AROUND BY SHIFTING ITS FOCUS FROM SEWING TO CRAFTS AND HOME DECORATING. 
A PROTOTYPE STORE, REOPENED IN SIMI VALLEY AFTER THE QUAKE, REPORTS A CLIMB IN 
SALES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JENNIFER PENDLETON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES

<P>
 These are trying times for House of Fabrics Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 The once thriving enterprise, based in Sherman Oaks, started on a downward 
course in 1992 when the company's earnings collapsed under the weight of the 
recession. Rumors of possible bankruptcy continue to surround it, leaving the 
financial and retailing communities wondering if the fabric retailer can turn 
itself around. 
</P>
<P>
 House of Fabrics is pinning its hopes on a new retailing concept to help solve 
its problems. At a handful of prototype stores, it is putting expanded emphasis 
on crafts and home decorating. The initial response has been positive. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, the firm is having to deal with the financial community's 
skepticism. Bob Simonson, a financial analyst with Kemper Securities in 
Chicago, and one of the few remaining analysts to follow House of Fabrics' 
stock, said the skepticism began to surface about a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "Confidence is such an important issue in remaining an ongoing concern. I just 
don't know if they're going to make it," Simonson said. 
</P>
<P>
 House of Fabrics lost $29.5 million on sales of $546 million in the year ended 
Jan. 31. Last month, it reported an $11.6-million loss for its fiscal second 
quarter ended July 31 and a 15% decline in revenue from a year earlier, to $110 
million. Its stock, which traded at $41 a share in 1991, adjusted for a 2-for-1 
split that year, closed Monday at $2.375 a share. 
</P>
<P>
 The company's predicament is so dire that it said it has asked landlords for a 
two-month moratorium on rents to the end of lease terms. 
</P>
<P>
 House of Fabrics' troubles have prompted some drastic moves. To cut costs, the 
company last month announced it would close 200 of its 624 stores by Jan. 31. 
Earlier this month, four months after the company's banks warned it of a 
possible default, it earned a reprieve when the banks agreed to waive existing 
and certain future defaults until Nov. 11, giving the company more time to 
pursue financial restructuring. 
</P>
<P>
 One hopeful sign was that in June, company executives reportedly bought just 
over 21,000 shares of House of Fabrics stock at average prices of $3.64 a 
share. Insider buying is generally viewed as a vote of confidence in a company. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, the company said it had entered into an agreement with a private 
investment partnership that would raise much-needed capital. Under the 
agreement, subject to a number of closing conditions, Levine Leichtman Capital 
Partners would purchase $20 million in subordinated notes, and receive warrants 
enabling it to possibly buy up to 35% of House of Fabrics' common stock at $1 
per share. 
</P>
<P>
 House of Fabrics is also working with the Finley Group, a turnaround 
consulting firm based in Charlotte, N.C., and is writing a new business plan to 
present to its banking group. 
</P>
<P>
 House of Fabrics President Gary L. Larkins said the company would not say 
which stores make up the 200 to be closed. The company is generally targeting 
mall stores and some of less profitable "superstores," primarily in the Midwest 
and Northeast, where House of Fabrics has strong competition. It is also 
liquidating inventory to lower its bank debt, which stood at $129.9 million as 
of Aug. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 House of Fabrics' vendors are apparently remaining steadfast. Bill Gardner, 
editor of the industry publication, Craftrends, listened in on a conference 
call between Larkins and suppliers shortly after the company announced its 
plans to close stores. 
</P>
<P>
 Gardner said the vendors, without prompting, expressed support for the 
company. Most said they would continue shipping to the retailer, even though 
some hadn't been paid for as long as five months. "House of Fabrics has been 
honest and upfront with vendors and they appreciate it," said Gardner. "Because 
of the people involved, they're sticking with them." 
</P>
<P>
 The turmoil at House of Fabrics stems from social change, shifts in the 
apparel business, and the recession. With the increase in working women, fewer 
people sew their own clothes, especially with the abundance of low-priced, 
ready-to-wear clothing that has saturated the market in recent years. The sour 
economy, particularly in California where House of Fabrics has most of its 
outlets, plus the Jan. 17 earthquake, put further pressure on the company. 
</P>
<P>
 While House of Fabrics is the weakest of the major players in the estimated $4 
billion-a-year fabric retailing industry, key competitors Fabri-Centers of 
America of Hudson, Ohio, and Hancock Fabrics of Tupelo, Miss., have also seen 
their profits slip because of changing consumer habits. The industry is also 
dealing with a massive hangover from over-expansion in the 1980s. Today, there 
are too many stores vying for the business of too few home sewing customers. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If it gets its financial house in order, House of Fabrics is hoping that its 
new crafts and home decorating emphasis will be its salvation. Last year, the 
company hired Doyle W. Parker, a former Wal-Mart craft buyer, to head its craft 
buying. It launched four prototype stores -- dubbed "Creative Centers" -- at 
former fabric superstores in Valencia, Simi Valley, Torrance and Temecula. The 
company will convert four more of its stores -- which carry a trimmed-down line 
of fabrics -- in the next 60 days, Larkins said. If all goes well, it hopes to 
have another 20 such outlets in the near future. 
</P>
<P>
 House of Fabrics has sold crafts at its outlets since the early 1980s, but it 
believes this merchandise can make up a greater portion of total sales because 
of the public's rising interest in crafts and home decorating. In the fiscal 
year ended Jan. 31, crafts represented about 15% of House of Fabrics' sales, 
but Larkins believes that share can rise to between 20% and 25%. 
</P>
<P>
 The House of Fabrics prototype store in Simi Valley is a 24,000-square-foot 
showroom featuring a huge selection of craft items, such as baskets, artificial 
flowers, pillows, needle craft, dolls and figurines, plus fabric for home 
sewing and decorating. Before the earthquake, the location was a House of 
Fabrics superstore. It was damaged by the Jan. 17 temblor and reopened five 
months later as one of the new concept stores. 
</P>
<P>
 The Simi Valley store manager, Christie McAdams, said sales at that prototype 
store have been climbing since then -- up 62% in June, 50% in July and 21% in 
August. "We're getting more and more crafts customers," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hobby Industry Assn. in Elmwood Park, N.J. estimates total crafts industry 
retail sales in 1993 at $9.6 billion. For the past four years, despite the 
recession, the industry has registered healthy annual increases. 
</P>
<P>
 But the question remains if House of Fabrics can solve its financial problems 
in time to introduce its crafts concept systemwide. 
</P>
<P>
 "The future of the company is currently in the hands of the bank and the 
vendors," concluded Craftrends publisher Michael Hartnett.

HEALTH NET EXECUTIVES SUE FOR STOCK INCENTIVES; PAYOUTS: A STATE AGENCY HAS 
BLOCKED A PLAN BY THE FORMER NONPROFIT COMPANY TO AWARD ITS 29 TOP MANAGERS 
STOCK TOTALING $65 MILLION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Health Net Chairman Roger Greaves and five other top executives with the big 
health maintenance organization are suing the state Department of Corporations 
for blocking their company's plan to award Greaves and 28 other executives $65 
million in stock incentives. 
</P>
<P>
 The department ordered Health Net to rescind the stock awards last year or 
risk facing a revocation of a 1992 state order permitting the Woodland 
Hills-based HMO to convert from nonprofit to for-profit status, according to 
Health Net's suit. The suit was filed Sept. 14 in Los Angeles Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
 But Greaves and the other plaintiffs in the suit argue that the stock awards 
are permitted under that conversion agreement, and that the department has 
acted "arbitrarily, capriciously" and beyond its authority in preventing the 
stock payouts. 
</P>
<P>
 Stephen Vogt, Health Net's vice chairman, said in a written statement that the 
stock awards are "part of an incentive plan designed to attract and retain the 
finest managers available." 
</P>
<P>
 Greaves stands to collect $18 million in stock if the awards are permitted, 
the company said. He and other Health Net executives have already reaped 
considerable financial rewards in bonuses and stock payouts since the company's 
for-profit conversion. 
</P>
<P>
 When Health Net converted to for-profit status, Greaves and 37 other 
executives paid $1.5 million for stock that today is valued at $140 million. In 
January, Greaves and four other Health Net managers paid themselves $3.3 
million in bonuses following the company's merger with QualMed Inc., a health 
maintenance organization based in Colorado. The Department of Corporations lost 
in a court attempt to prevent Health Net from paying those bonuses, a Health 
Net spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 But consumer groups have criticized the stock awards and bonuses as excessive 
for a company that built its operations while enjoying the tax-exempt status of 
a nonprofit corporation. 
</P>
<P>
 Health Net, the second-largest HMO in the state with 1.2 million members, was 
established as a nonprofit corporation in 1986. Following the conversion to 
for-profit status, Health Net was required to transfer 80% of its equity to a 
successor charity. Health Net created the California Wellness Foundation to 
serve as that successor charity.

REGIONAL ROUNDUP: SYNCOR INTERNATIONAL EXPECTS QUARTERLY LOSS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Syncor International Corp., a Chatsworth-based supplier of nuclear 
pharmaceutical products, said it expects to post a loss for the quarter ending 
Sept. 30. 
</P>
<P>
 It cited cost-cutting pressures in the health care industry, stemming from 
managed health-care providers, as a cause of the loss. 
</P>
<P>
 Syncor said it will report a loss of about $1 million on revenues of about $80 
million for the quarter. In the three-month period a year earlier, the company 
earned $3 million on sales of $60.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Syncor Chief Executive Gene R. McGrevin attributed the expected loss to "the 
adverse effect health-care suppliers are facing due to the demands for more 
cost-effective care." Such pressures, he said, have cut into the company 's 
profit margins, a trend expected to continue through the rest of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Syncor operates a network of 113 nuclear pharmacy centers that supply 
radioactive pharmaceutical products used to diagnose ailments ranging from 
heart disease to brain disorders. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary L. Meusborn, a Syncor spokeswoman, said the company hopes to return to 
profitability by moving into still-expanding markets for nuclear pharmaceutical 
products used to diagnose brain and liver disorders. She said the company may 
also curtail the number of pharmacists it employs at its centers.

VENTURA COUNTY REVIEW: FILLMORE-MADE LIGHT POLES STAND UP TO QUAKE TEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jack Searles

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If you've passed through earthquake-hit Fillmore lately, you may have noticed 
that at least part of the city came through January's quake unscathed: the 
light poles. 
</P>
<P>
 The prestressed concrete poles are made by a Fillmore concern, Ameron Pole 
Products & Systems."We spin steel wires into the poles; that adds tremendously 
to their strength," said John Reynolds, vice president of the division, a unit 
of Pasadena-based Ameron Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 Orders have increased somewhat as word has circulated that Ameron's poles 
stood straight and tall when the quake hit Fillmore and several Los Angeles 
County communities, Reynolds said. "A lot of old-fashioned poles crumbled, but 
it's hard to get public officials to acknowledge that it's time for a change." 
</P>
<P>
 Ameron Pole, which has 85 employees in Fillmore, markets its poles throughout 
North America.

 Dawn Hodson, president of J. D. Hodson & Associates, a Ventura management

<P>
 * Amiables. "They're warm, sincere and loyal, but they hate sudden change. 
Cooperate with them; don't compete."

Don't argue."

VENTURA COUNTY REVIEW: SPECULATION ARISES OVER CLOSURE OF LONG-TIME AD FIRM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jack Searles 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ventura County advertising and public relations executives have differing 
views regarding the closure earlier this month of the county's largest 
advertising and public relations firm, the Murphy Organization. 
</P>
<P>
 After 25 years in business, Murphy has shut its doors, and most of its staff 
and clients have moved to an Agoura Hills agency, Mustang Marketing & 
Advertising. 
</P>
<P>
 Murphy's former vice president and creative director, Madeline Murphy, blames 
Ventura County's lingering recession for closure of the firm that she headed 
with her husband, Robert, who was president. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Madeline Murphy and four others were hired by Mustang, Robert Murphy 
was not. She declined to say whether she and her husband have become 
part-owners of Mustang. 
</P>
<P>
 "As the recession deepened, more and more of our clients reduced or even 
eliminated their marketing budgets," Madeline Murphy said. "Some of them turned 
to out-of-work advertising and PR people who could afford to charge lower fees 
because they didn't have our expenses." 
</P>
<P>
 This, she said, cut into Murphy's revenues and led to its demise. 
</P>
<P>
 Some industry leaders, however, think that there may be other reasons behind 
the closure. 
</P>
<P>
 "They had a respectable client base. I'm surprised they couldn't make it under 
those circumstances," said Keith Johnston, president of Johnston Ad Groups, a 
Ventura agency. "It's possible that they were having management problems." 
</P>
<P>
 Added Stan Whisenhunt, head of Ventura-based Stan Whisenhunt Public Relations: 
"This may be more of a lifestyle change for the Murphys than anything else." 
</P>
<P>
 The economy is still tough, he conceded, "but business has been getting 
better. The Murphys may simply have gotten tired of all the overhead and 
headaches involved in running a large agency." 
</P>
<P>
 But Madeline Murphy insists that declining revenues were the only problem that 
forced the agency's closure. She would not disclose the Murphy Organization's 
billings or other financial information. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Arlow, past president of the county's Public Information Communicators 
Assn. and head of the Arlow Group, a Thousand Oaks ad and PR firm, noted that 
Madeline Murphy has good reason to despair over a lackluster local economy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Business in this county is struggling, just as it is in Los Angeles and 
elsewhere," he said. "Instead of going to a large agency such as Murphy was, 
clients these days want to know whether you can save them money by using 
desktop publishing." 
</P>
<P>
 At its peak in 1991, the Murphy Organization had 24 employees. Along with 
revenues, the payroll shrank as some of the agency's largest clients, such as 
Bank of A. Levy, began to retrench. 
</P>
<P>
 In a final effort to contain costs, Murphy moved from Oxnard's Union Bank 
Tower to smaller quarters in Camarillo. In the end, only eight employees 
remained, including the Murphys. 
</P>
<P>
 Mustang President Scott Harris says his firm has acquired several major Murphy 
accounts, including Cal Lutheran University, 3M Co.'s Camarillo plant, Martin 
V. Smith & Associates and Ahmanson Land Co., developer of the controversial 
Ahmanson Ranch project in eastern Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 Even before the closure, Mustang had acquired former Murphy client Bank of A. 
Levy -- an account that's scheduled to disappear when Levy is acquired by First 
Interstate Bank. 
</P>
<P>
 Mustang already had several clients in Ventura County, including Technicolor 
Video Services, Power-One Inc. and California Amplifier. The agency also 
represents the L. A. Dodgers and Pepperdine University. 
</P>
<P>
 Harris said the ex-Murphy staffers will strengthen Mustang by providing PR and 
media-buying expertise. He said his firm already prides itself on its strength 
in graphics. 
</P>
<P>
 "The new people will help us offer our clients full-service marketing power," 
he said.

HAMMERS IN FULL SWING; VALLEY'S SMALL REPAIR, CONSTRUCTION FIRMS STRUGGLE TO 
MEET DEMAND AS POST-QUAKE PROSPERITY FINALLY BEGINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JILL LEOVY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Daily invasions of the San Fernando Valley by an army of carpenters, plumbers, 
masons and electricians signal that, for small construction and repair 
businesses, the hoped-for boom from the Northridge earthquake has finally hit. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many people are just starting their repairs now," said Robin Bauer, who 
co-owns the small Northridge contracting firm A.D.B. Construction and 
Installations with her husband, Dean. "If no one calls for the next two years, 
we will still be busy," she said. Those new customers Bauer is trying to 
squeeze in must now wait weeks to get a small job done, and months for a large 
one, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The surge in business comes from homeowners who were held at bay for months by 
lengthy insurance negotiations and pending aid checks from the Federal 
Emergency Management Agency. With that settled, contractors say they are 
finally getting hired to attack the big home-repair jobs left by the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 The result is as apparent to the ears as to the eyes: Once-silent suburban 
neighborhoods now come alive at 7 a.m. with a cacophony of jackhammers, drills 
and clacking timbers. On some Valley streets, nearly every home is fronted by a 
telltale pile of broken masonry and plaster. 
</P>
<P>
 Earthquake repairs have produced enough debris so far to fill a line of dump 
trucks stretching bumper to bumper from here to San Francisco. Officials with 
the city's debris pickup program say the volume of waste has increased in the 
last two months due to a speedup in construction, and the free rubble pickup 
program was recently extended to January. 
</P>
<P>
 Statistics are hard to come by, but a sampling of local contractors produces a 
nearly unanimous consensus: Although calls for free estimates and small, 
emergency fix-ups poured in immediately after the January quake, the major 
surge for contractors has only begun in recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a lag time when no one was getting money," explained contractor 
John Wurster, owner of John Wurster and Associates Inc. of Calabasas. Wurster 
said the impact of the quake on his business didn't take shape until July, when 
his monthly sales surged 100% compared to the same time last year, and they are 
holding strong. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Steele, owner of Reseda-based Artisan Concrete, spent the first months 
after the quake in frustration, waiting for the work to come in. "Now it's not 
frustrating," he said. "But there's no time left for personal stuff." Steele 
has been working more than 60 hours per week since the earthquake. He now 
thinks his sales this year will be up 30% over last year's, but he's not 
getting to spend any time with his sons in football practice. And his phone 
just keeps ringing. "We are breaking our backs trying to keep up with it," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 For contractors -- an industry populated by small, mom-and-pop companies -- 
the quake-triggered bounty is a reprieve after several bad years. Many had 
endured losses as a result of a slowdown in new home construction and 
remodeling. Now these same firms are turning customers away. Some are working 
strictly by referral, eschewing calls from yellow-page shoppers. Others have 
abandoned free estimates. Small contractors surveyed say their sales have at 
least doubled this year compared to last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Homeowners contemplating their torn-out walls and ceilings, with checks from 
their insurance companies or the SBA, often find the temptation to remodel 
irresistible. That's made earthquake repairs are all the more lucrative for 
contractors. "People are adding on new bathrooms and new rooms in their houses. 
We haven't seen that since the '80s," said Jim Alexander, vice president of 
Woodland Hills-based William Frankel Plumbing, who said he expects his sales 
this year to be 40% higher than last year. 
</P>
<P>
 What's feeding the construction boom is $665 million in Federal Emergency 
Management Agency grants for home repairs, paid out as of Sept. 1, and an 
estimated $7.2 billion in insurance claims still flowing into 
earthquake-affected areas. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just take it while it's there," said Wurster, the Calabasas contractor, 
summing up the spirit of the times. Wurster said his 35-year-old company will 
be profitable for the first time in five years thanks to quake repairs, and he 
recently hired four new workers, for a total of 11. 
</P>
<P>
 "It'll be nice to get out of debt," said Ed Bilow, who runs a one-man 
contracting operation from his home in Chatsworth. "I haven't had to worry 
about the bills getting paid, and my wife is buying more things than usual." 
</P>
<P>
 Bilow said revenues so far this year for his firm, A.D.-J.C. Creations, are 
twice last year's, though he isn't sure. He hasn't found the time to file his 
quarterly tax forms and will end up paying a fine. 
</P>
<P>
 The repair boom comes as no surprise to staff members at the area office of 
City Councilwoman Laura Chick, who have learned to keep fraud hot-line numbers 
at their fingertips because they are deluged with complaints of contractor 
rip-offs. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor is it news to the dispatchers at the Devonshire division of the LAPD, who 
field a daily smattering of complaints from raw-nerved residents about 
construction noise. Ken Knox, senior lead officer for the West Valley precinct, 
said contractor fraud and illegal dumping are the hot topics at Neighborhood 
Watch meetings he attends. 
</P>
<P>
 Responding to reports of fraudulent and unlicensed operators, officials with 
the Contractors State License Board have conducted numerous sweeps of 
earthquake-hit areas. So far, they've cited 65 people for doing construction 
work without a license, an offense that carries a maximum fine of $15,000. 
Another 117 fines have been assessed to contractors who could not provide proof 
of workers' compensation insurance, according to Sam Haynes, spokesman for the 
board. 
</P>
<P>
 More serious offenses, such as taking payments without doing any work, have 
been rampant too. The city attorney's office has so far prosecuted about 50 
cases involving earthquake-related contractor fraud, said spokesman Mike 
Qualls. 
</P>
<P>
 Joseph Caponetta, owner of Woodland Hills-based Caponetta Construction, said 
he thinks his sales this year will be 30 times higher than last year, for a 
simple reason: Last year was terrible. "I had no big jobs at all -- nothing but 
bathrooms," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the quake, Caponetta's big jobs have included jacking up houses to 
replace foundations and stripping entire houses down to the studs to retrofit. 
At one job in Encino earlier this month, Caponetta waited to meet with the 
owners, who have been living elsewhere since January. As he talked, daylight 
poured in through gaping holes in every wall. On the street below, heavy trucks 
cruised by, headed for jobs at neighboring houses. 
</P>
<P>
 With the extra cash in his pocket, Caponetta said he recently splurged on a 
childhood dream. He bought the body and chassis of a 1932 Ford street rod and 
plans to refurbish it. 
</P>
<P>
 Others aren't quite ready to run up bills. Greg Parness, owner of a plumbing 
firm called Drain King, said the extra work should be just enough to cover his 
own losses from the quake. His office in Northridge was damaged severely, and 
so was his home. "It's been a real hectic year," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Many repair workers talk of the strain of long days, capped by hours of 
paperwork at home at night. Some have been working mammoth schedules 
continuously since January. "I didn't know it would be like this. I'm always 
running, always busy, working 15 hours a day," Caponetta said. 
</P>
<P>
 And with the wait for quake repairs now stretching into eight months, 
customers' patience is beginning to wear thin. Most just want the job done, and 
done quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 For workers, these repairs are often tedious -- replacing walls or cracked 
plumbing -- and lack the excitement of remodeling. "People don't exactly bring 
the neighbors over to show them their new hot-water heater," said John Van 
Diepen, owner of A Straight Line Construction Co., based in Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Although there is lots of work out there, that doesn't mean money is easily 
had. Many contractors said they first had to learn that tried-and-true methods 
would no longer fly in this new market. The practice of giving free estimates, 
for example, overwhelmed many businesses after the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 "I realized it was getting out of hand," said Bilow, the Chatsworth 
contractor. Bilow's story is familiar to many in the business. He says few of 
countless free estimates he gave turned into jobs. Now, he charges a token fee 
to customers he doesn't know to "weed out" all but the serious shoppers. 
</P>
<P>
 Contractors say they've learned to ask hard questions when potential customers 
call: Has their insurance company paid on their claim? How many contractors 
have they called? Are they flipping through a phone book? "We aren't interested 
in doing only estimates," explained Mona Van Diepen, wife of John Van Diepen, 
and controller of his Simi Valley firm. 
</P>
<P>
 Bilow and others say that, in the end, most contracts come from relatives, 
friends, former customers and referrals. "I've heard from people I built houses 
for 30 years ago," said Wurster, the Calabasas contractor. 
</P>
<P>
 Construction firms have had to become experts at backing insurance claims. 
Caponetta said he's developed a new practice of painstaking room-by-room 
examinations to produce dispute-proof estimates. "Now I guess I can call myself 
an earthquake specialist," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Opinions vary on how long the boom will last. Many contractors say that, 
although requests for new jobs may be peaking, they have enough work in the 
pipeline to keep them busy for months, if not years. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, 85% of earthquake insurance claims have been paid out, according to 
the Western Insurance Information Service, an insurance industry trade group 
based in Los Angeles. Jack Kyser, chief economist for the Los Angeles County 
Economic Development Corp., said there are enough quake repairs remaining to 
tide over contractors until the economy improves and housing construction takes 
off again in 1996 or after. 
</P>
<P>
 Few small contractors are as sanguine. Although revenues at A Straight Line 
Construction Co. are up 75% to date this year from last year, and the firm has 
hired 13 new workers, owner Van Diepen doesn't see the end of hard times. 
"Aerospace workers used to be our fundamental client base. Now our client base 
is earthquake victims. But when this is done, who is it going to be?" he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But a short-lived boom is good enough for Miry Rabinovitch. Rabinovitch is 
co-owner with husband Ze'ev of Banai Construction in Van Nuys. "We aren't going 
to be millionaires," she said. "But right now, we are enjoying not having to 
worry about tomorrow."

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / PROPOSITION 187; RAISIN FARMERS HIT BY SHORTAGE OF 
WORKERS; POLITICAL TURMOIL OVER ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION IS CITED BY SOME GROWERS AS 
A REASON THAT FEWER LABORERS WERE AVAILABLE THIS YEAR. 'SAVE OUR STATE' 
INITIATIVE WOULD ADD TO THE PROBLEM, THEY SAY.

<P>
 In political campaign land, the border may be porous and the state overrun 
with illegal immigrants, but here in the raisin capital of the world farmers 
spent the past month scrambling to find workers -- both legal and illegal -- to 
pick an overflowing crop. 
</P>
<P>
 Some raisin farmers and labor contractors attribute the worker shortage to 
fewer illegals crossing the border because of a recent government crackdown. 
</P>
<P>
 Others say the pool of illegal workers with phony documents is as large as 
ever, but more industries are now calling on them. Farmers here must now 
compete with construction, fast-food businesses, hotels, garment manufacturers 
and farmers in other states for the services of illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 Either way, they say, this summer's labor pinch in the dusty vineyards 
underscores how much California relies on the sweat of illegal immigrants from 
Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lets face it," said Harry Kubo of the Nisei Farmers League, which represents 
1,200 growers from Tulare to Santa Cruz counties. "Fifty percent, if not more, 
of the agricultural work force in this valley is illegal. We'd sink 
economically without them." 
</P>
<P>
 Kubo, a staunch Republican, is more than a little worried about Proposition 
187, the "Save Our State" initiative, which would make legal residency a 
requirement for public schooling and most other services. Although illegal 
immigrants may burden the education and welfare systems, he said, legal workers 
simply refuse to fill many of the manual labor jobs throughout the state. 
</P>
<P>
 Here in the heartland, farmers and labor contractors believe that Proposition 
187, combined with the recent free trade agreement with Mexico, will bring more 
severe worker shortages in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of labor contractors reported a 15% to 20% shortage in workers this 
summer," said Bruce Conley of SunMaid, the huge raisin cooperative. "We don't 
know what the future holds. We're looking very possibly at more shortages." 
</P>
<P>
 The San Joaquin Valley is a prism on the manifold issues of illegal 
immigration from Mexico. If illegal workers do not make it this far north, it 
is because they were either deported, returned to Mexico or found better jobs 
in Southern California. It is interesting, too, because farmers, typically a 
conservative lot, have a unique spin on the matter. Indeed, the whole issue 
places them in a rough spot -- between Gov. Pete Wilson, whom they support, and 
his immigration policies, which they oppose. 
</P>
<P>
 Some believe that Wilson, by filing a lawsuit against the federal government 
and arguing that illegal immigration is tantamount to a foreign invasion, has 
made a whipping boy of migrants. These are the workers who operate the tractors 
and spray rigs, prune and pick the fruit trees and vines, and buttress an 
economy that accounts for one in 10 state jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a lot of political rhetoric," said Casey Jones, who farms a 160-acre 
vineyard in Selma. 
</P>
<P>
 A month ago, Jones was frantically calling his labor contractor looking for 
crews. He needed to pick his Thompson grapes and give them two to three weeks 
of dry weather to cure into raisins. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said a crew will be here tomorrow at 6, but they never showed," Jones 
said. "I waited a few days and he called and said he couldn't get me the 
people. They had gone to Dinuba to pick peaches." 
</P>
<P>
 The labor contractor drove from one unemployment office to the next in two 
counties looking for workers. He found no takers. Jones eventually got his 
grapes picked and placed on the ground to dry but 10 days later than usual. 
Then, a few days before the crop was fully cured, his worst fear: Rain hit 
Selma. Depending on the damage, he and other growers may be eligible for crop 
insurance loss. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's all because I was late getting down," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In a typical year, about 50,000 workers are needed to harvest the Thompson 
grapes that become raisins. About half that many are needed to turn, roll and 
pick up the dried fruit. This summer, the competition for illegal workers 
holding fraudulent permits was so keen that labor contractors from Washington 
came to the San Joaquin Valley to recruit. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington's record apple crop promised four more weeks of steady work at 
higher wages, the middlemen announced. They took whole crews back with them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I lost 125 workers to Washington alone," said Angel Maya, a labor contractor 
in the Selma area. 
</P>
<P>
 Other forces impinged on the labor picture as well. This summer, the raisin 
industry stopped its surplus diversion program that retired some vineyards from 
production. Other grape growers who usually opt for the juice concentrate 
market were forced by poor prices to make raisins instead. With more 
labor-intensive raisins in production, more workers were needed. 
</P>
<P>
 And the forces of supply and demand are not always above board. Some raisin 
growers with heavy crop insurance chose to pick at the last minute when the 
demand for workers was greatest. They did this, according to growers and labor 
contractors, to increase the odds of losing their crop to rain. 
</P>
<P>
 Likewise, they said, many illegal immigrants who might be working in the 
fields have found a fraudulent way to collect unemployment under two and three 
Social Security numbers. Others have opted to be couriers for major drug 
smuggling rings. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've lost 12 men to drug smuggling in the past year," said Larry Peters, a 
labor contractor. "They start off in the underground, and they've gone further 
underground." 
</P>
<P>
 Peters disputes the notion that increased enforcement by the Border Patrol has 
had an effect. He said the labor shortage is a simple case of more illegal 
immigrants from Mexico pursuing jobs outside farming. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look at the garment and restaurant industries. Look at the janitors and cooks 
and gardeners and room maids," he said. "I've lost 30 men to one roofing 
company in Fresno. They're working for cash in the construction industry and 
collecting unemployment as farm workers under another name." 
</P>
<P>
 Ray Lopez of Fowler Packing said his company was able to avoid a labor 
shortage this year by lining up crews early in the season. But all the planning 
in the world, Lopez said, might not be enough if the bashing of illegal 
immigrants continues. 
</P>
<P>
 "It plays well as a political issue, but if the politicians get their way, 
we're going to be in trouble," he said. "If you removed every illegal from this 
state tomorrow, you'd see the businesses -- and not just the agricultural 
business -- start to crumble."

U.S. TO SETTLE KICKBACK CASE WITH O.C. FIRM; MEDICINE: AGREEMENT INVOLVING UNIT 
OF CORAM HEALTHCARE CORP. OF NEWPORT BEACH ENDS TWO-YEAR PROBE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBORA VRANA, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 In a settlement underscoring the government's commitment to regulate 
physicians' financial ties to private health-care providers, a unit of a 
Newport Beach home-infusion company has agreed to pay $500,000 to end a 
two-year investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement between T2 Medical, an Atlanta company that supplies intravenous 
drugs and nutrients to patients in their homes, and the U.S. Department of 
Health and Human Services was filed Monday in U.S. District Court in Atlanta. 
The probe had focused on whether T2 Medical's infusion therapy centers violated 
federal anti-kickback laws. 
</P>
<P>
 T2 Medical's centers were set up as partnerships jointly owned by the company 
and some physicians. When the investor doctors referred patients to the 
centers, they shared in the profits. 
</P>
<P>
 Without admitting to wrongdoing, T2 Medical agreed to stop managing 
physician-owned entities except on a limited basis, to stop offering doctors 
preferred deals on stock in the company and to avoid participating in any 
partnership with doctors in any business providing home infusion. 
</P>
<P>
 T2 Medical, one of four companies recently acquired by Coram Healthcare Corp. 
of Newport Beach, operates in more than 100 cities and 38 states nationwide.  
</P>
<P>
 "This is far-reaching and precedent-setting," said Ross Stromberg, an attorney 
who specializes in health-care cases at the law firm Jones Day Reavis & Pogue 
in Los Angeles, on Monday. "The federal government is attempting to give notice 
to the field to be extremely cautious in business arrangements with physicians. 
It will have a chilling effect on what companies are doing. And I think the 
government intended that." 
</P>
<P>
 Stromberg said the effects of the settlement go beyond what is spelled out in 
federal anti-kickback laws. Profiting from patient referrals has been a 
divisive issue in the medical community in recent years, prompting critics to 
declare that physicians who profit from their investments in services such as 
home infusion violate longstanding medical principles. 
</P>
<P>
 "This practice is unethical, and it's gradually getting to be illegal," said 
Arnold Relman, a Boston physician who is a former editor of the New England 
Journal of Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
 James M. Sweeney, Coram's chairman and chief executive officer, said Monday 
that T2 Medical has already stopped forming the types of partnerships outlined 
in the agreement with the federal agency and that Coram will have repurchased 
all doctor stakes in the centers by December. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a real positive step for the whole industry to get away from this kind 
of practice," said Sweeney, adding that Coram agreed to the settlement to avoid 
a long and potentially costly legal battle. 
</P>
<P>
 A new law that will take effect Jan. 1 specifically prohibits home-infusion 
companies from forming financial relationships with doctors who accept federal 
funds such as Medicare payments. And federal statutes for years have forbidden 
payments to doctors in direct return for a professional referral if federal 
funds are involved, Relman said. But physicians could still profit from 
investments in certain medical-services companies, such as high-tech 
laboratories. 
</P>
<P>
 Other analysts said that, while the settlement will have an effect, the amount 
of the fine imposed will not send shivers through the medical community.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's so small that it doesn't even qualify as a slap on the wrist," said 
Randall Huyser, a health-care analyst at Furman Selz Inc., an investment bank 
in San Francisco. "The message of this is that it's awfully hard to prove 
malfeasance." 
</P>
<P>
 Suki Shattuck, spokeswoman for Homedco Group Inc. in Fountain Valley, said she 
does not expect the settlement to affect either Coram or Homedco, which is also 
in the home-infusion business. "We never operated in that way," she said. "I 
don't see the settlement impacting them significantly or us." 
</P>
<P>
 Coram was created July 11 from the merger of four companies: T2 Medical, 
Curaflex Health Services Inc. of Ontario, HealthInfusion Inc. of Miami and 
Medisys Inc. of Edina, Minn. It is the nation's second-largest provider of 
home-infusion services, which have grown in recent years as hospitals have 
moved to cut costs by hiring out costly services to private companies such as 
high-tech X-ray labs. 
</P>
<P>
 In New York Stock Exchange trading Monday, Coram's stock closed at $18.125, 
down 12.5 cents a share.

JOHN WAYNE AIRPORT MAY REDUCE LANDING FEES; AVIATION: SUPERVISORS TO ACT ON 
REQUEST THAT WOULD CUT AIRLINE COSTS BY MORE THAN $1 MILLION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WOODYARD, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Airlines serving John Wayne Airport could reap a windfall of more than $1 
million today if the Orange County Board of Supervisors agrees to a request to 
cut landing fees and overnight aircraft parking fees. 
</P>
<P>
 Passengers, however, are unlikely to share in what would be the airport's 
second fee reduction within a year. Airline industry spokesmen say that market 
demand, not fees, determines ticket pricing. 
</P>
<P>
 For their part, airport officials say they cannot shift any of the savings to 
the traveling public by reducing charges such as auto parking fees. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have separate cost centers," Airport Director Jan Mittermeier said. "It 
has to be that way so we can make sure the airlines pay costs properly 
associated with general aviation." 
</P>
<P>
 The fee reduction is made possible because of the increasing number of 
passenger and commercial aircraft flying into Orange County, creating a surplus 
in the account that is supported by landing and plane parking fees. 
</P>
<P>
 The money collected from landing fees is used for maintaining such airport 
infrastructure as runways, taxiways and outdoor lighting. Airlines are assessed 
charges based on the weight of planes that land at the airport. When service at 
the airport is expanded, as it was in the past year with the addition of 
passenger service by Southwest Airlines, the total collected also rises. 
</P>
<P>
 Landing fees would be cut by about 12% under the proposal. That would amount 
to savings of $968,460 to major airlines, which paid landing fees totaling $8 
million for 1993. Air carriers also received rebates last year. 
</P>
<P>
 The airport is also proposing a 6% reduction in the fees charged to airlines 
to park their jetliners overnight. If approved, that reduction would save 
carriers another $156,594. 
</P>
<P>
 The airport finds itself with surplus cash while other public agencies are 
struggling with budget cutbacks. The money cannot be designated for general use 
by the county, however, because the federal government prohibits such 
transfers. That policy was reinforced in a federal appropriations bill passed 
earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
 County Supervisor Thomas F. Riley said that, as a matter of policy, the 
airport should be fair and charge its various customers -- both airlines and 
travelers -- fees equal to the cost of providing a service. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't justify, 'We can charge what we can get,' " Riley said. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the fee rebates to air carriers translating to lower ticket prices, 
that isn't likely, airline officials say. "Fares are set by the marketplace," 
said American Airlines spokesman Tim Smith. "It's not a direct relationship" 
between ticket prices and landing fees. 
</P>
<P>
 Lower landing fees, however, may encourage airlines to maintain or augment 
their service to John Wayne, said Chris Chiames, a spokesman for the Air 
Transport Assn. in Washington, an industry group. "It's going to result in 
lower costs to airlines," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 If approved, John Wayne's new landing fees would be slightly below those at 
Los Angeles International, where fees were tripled a year ago despite much 
protest from airlines. Unlike LAX, John Wayne has a waiting list of airlines 
that want to start service or to increase their numbers of flights using larger 
aircraft. All carriers operating in Orange County must comply with strict noise 
restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
 The fee reduction at John Wayne goes before the Board of Supervisors as a 
consent item, meaning that it will probably pass with little or no discussion. 
What They Paid 
</P>
<P>
 Airlines serving John Wayne Airport could collectively benefit by more than $1 
million if the Orange County Board of Supervisors approves the airport's 
request to reduce landing fees and fees charged for parking planes overnight. 
What airlines paid in fiscal year 1992-93: 03,14,14,16 Airline Landing Fees

GARMENT FIRM TO PAY $20,000 IN WAGES CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The owner of Ly's Fashions, a Santa Ana garment maker, must pay $20,000 in 
back pay and penalties as part of a federal court judgment in a U.S. Labor 
Department case accusing him of violating federal minimum wage and overtime 
laws, the agency said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Ngoc Ly Thi Vu agreed to the judgment in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles 
and will pay $16,000 in back wages to employees and $4,000 in penalties to the 
agency. 
</P>
<P>
 The Labor Department accused Ly's Fashions of paying employees by the piece, 
resulting in wages that were less than federal minimum hourly rates of $4.25 
for regular work and $6.375 for overtime.

 New Theme Park: After much talk about building a second Disney theme park and 
a resort in Anaheim, the Santa Clarita Valley may instead be the first 
Southland community to put two theme parks on the same property. 
</P>
<P>
 Time Warner's Six Flags division said it will build a water park next to Magic 
Mountain in Valencia, to open next year.Called Six Flags Hurricane Harbor, the 
park will feature lagoons, replicas of shipwrecks, water slides and a wave 
pool. 
</P>
<P>
 Entrance to the water park will require a separate admission ticket from the 
neighboring Magic Mountain theme park. 
</P>

ORANGE COUNTY BRIEFLY: TEACHERS MANAGEMENT LOSES BID TO MOVE TRIAL TO FEDERAL 
COURT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A federal judge in Los Angeles has denied a bid by Teachers Management & 
Investment Corp., the Newport Beach company that raised about $1 billion from 
California teachers, to move a lawsuit filed against the company, an attorney 
said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 On Aug. 23, four teachers sued TMI in Orange County Superior Court alleging 
that the company lost $100 million in investor funds through fraud and 
racketeering.The suit asks that a receiver be appointed to seize whatever 
assets remain at the company, which has sold real estate partnerships to 60,000 
educators. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this month, TMI sought to have the case moved to federal court in Los 
Angeles, but the action was denied by U.S. District Judge Ronald S. Lew. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokeswoman for TMI confirmed the action but said company officials had no 
comment.

 MTI Technology Corp.: The Anaheim-based company has sued CMD Technology Inc., 
alleging that its Irvine-based rival has infringed on six patents that MTI 
holds on processes used to store data on computer disks. 
</P>
<P>
 In the suit, filed in U.S. District Court in San Jose on Friday, MTI seeks an 
unspecified amount of damages.MTI President Steve Hamerslag said the company 
will base the amount it seeks on how many products CMD has sold through alleged 
use of the disputed technology. MTI also seeks an injunction to stop CMD from 
making or selling the products. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Rudy, CMD vice president, said his company is "absolutely certain" that it 
doesn't infringe on MTI's patents. 
</P>
<P>
 The patents at issue involve a technology known as Redundant Array of 
Independent Disks, which helps protect stored computer data.

ERASING THE PAST; IRVINE INSTITUTE'S LASERS HELP EX-GANG MEMBERS LOSE TATTOOS 
-- AND GAIN RESPECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN HOWLETT, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<P>
 From one knuckle to the other, the tattoo had reflected his mood at the time. 
It spelled HATE in crude black lettering on his left hand, and the former 
skinhead from Newport Beach recalls that a couple of years ago, it was an 
appropriate four-letter word. 
</P>
<P>
 "I ran away that day. I had a disagreement at home about how I was always in 
trouble, so I just walked out," said Jesse, now 16, who asked that his last 
name not be used. "This guy had a tattoo gun, and I talked him into it. I kept 
saying, "just give it to me, just give it to me, I don't care." 
</P>
<P>
 The hate is gone from his knuckles now, and Jesse says, from his heart. Alone 
in his room in Orange County Juvenile Hall last summer, the teen-ager penned a 
letter to Irvine's Beckman Laser Institute after hearing about a tattoo removal 
program to help former gang members make a fresh start. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am 14 years old and have a lot of years ahead of me," he wrote. "I think 
that if I have a tattoo that says 'hate' on my fingers I'll probably have a 
rough time in my life. . . . I want people to think of me as a good kid, 
someone they could trust." 
</P>
<P>
 After applying for and receiving financial assistance through the program, 
Jesse's left hand bears only a faded pink reminder of his troubled past. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm glad people don't even see the scars," said Jesse, who now lives in 
Seattle with his father. "I remember that my mom really cried when she first 
saw them. And later, we would be laughing, and having a good time, and she 
would look at my hand and turn sad. I'm glad it's gone." 
</P>
<P>
 In the two years since the program started, 27 former gang members have had 
tattoos removed and 100 are now undergoing treatment, said program director 
Anne Rosse. Acceptance is based on need. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, fund-raising problems almost ended the Beckman program, which was 
among those labeled as "indigent care," she said. But after a survey triggered 
emotional pleas from the ex-gang members who had finished the procedure, clinic 
administrators made cutbacks elsewhere. Doctors donated their time, and 
directors trimmed their working budgets, allowing the Treatment Assistance Fund 
to remain at the Irvine facility. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were thrilled when we saw the responses (to the survey)," Rosse said. "Not 
only were we helping with employment, but we were helping with their 
self-esteem. That's what struck me the most. 
</P>
<P>
 "They gave much more detailed answers than we expected," Rosse said, adding 
that some of the former gang members wrote pages about how the removal had 
gotten them jobs, boosted their morale and generally improved their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 There were also poignant letters that came with applications. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know I've made mistakes in the past, and now I'm paying greatly for them," 
read one letter, written by an 18-year-old mother who often hid her tattoos 
beneath bandages while working at a doctor's office. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's been times when I'm speaking to a patient and as soon as they see my 
tattoo they look away and go ask (someone else) the same question they asked 
me. They think I'm not capable of answering their questions. This has slowly 
lowered my self-esteem and hopes that I had when I started working there." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The district attorney's office estimates that there are 16,000 youths in 
Orange County gangs, a majority of whom have homemade tattoos with their gang 
affiliations or nicknames on their hands, faces and necks. The "tattoo guns" 
consist of a junkyard of items that can include a guitar string for a needle, a 
portable cassette player motor and India ink. 
</P>
<P>
 Like those of Jesse and several others seeking laser treatment, the marks on 
"Khanh's" hands were also the products of a back-alley tattoo gun. 
</P>
<P>
 He remembers that when he was stealing cars and running from his probation 
officer in Santa Ana, the faded green writing on his wrists and fingers were a 
source of pride -- the kind that comes with hanging with a gang. It wasn't 
until he quit that life that the letters and symbols spelled nothing but 
danger. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I stopped playing with the gang, I got into a lot of fights. They all 
want to fight you when they see the tattoos all over your hands. I got tired of 
getting into trouble." 
</P>
<P>
 Khanh, which is not his real name, is trying to erase the memory of his 
crime-filled childhood. He goes to school, shows up for work at a local pizza 
parlor and says he feels good about himself for the first time in a long while. 
</P>
<P>
 "People don't look down on me anymore," says Khanh, who still has a few more 
laser treatments before the brands vanish for good. "When you play with the 
gangs, it only means trouble. I'm trying to be good. I'm trying to change." 
</P>
<P>
 Changing isn't as simple as taking off the tattoos. Khanh's Vietnamese 
American family moved him to the El Toro area and away from the gangs and drugs 
that plagued his old Santa Ana neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want them to find me," he said about his former gang members. "I 
don't need trouble." 
</P>
<P>
 Khanh's mother, who keeps a watchful eye over her son these days, said during 
an interview in the family's living room that she is proud of her son. "We are 
happy now," she said. "He is a good boy now, and that makes us happy." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Depending on the size of the tattoo, doctors say, it can take up to a dozen 
treatments to eradicate it. Homemade gang insignias and symbols are the easiest 
to erase, taking just five or six treatments. The 15-minute laser treatments 
cost up to $400. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Beckman Laser Institute, they use either the ruby laser or the Nd:YAG 
laser which were "Q-switched," or adapted for tattoo removal, according to 
nurse director Joyce Zeiler. The ruby laser was first developed in the 1960s 
and gets its name from the crystal it uses. The Nd:YAG is a newer laser that 
Beckman recently began using.  
</P>
<P>
 Before laser treatment, tattoos were either removed by sanding off 
(dermabrasion) or cutting out (excision), Zeiler said. Both treatments were 
very painful and left scars. 
</P>
<P>
 In both the ruby and YAG procedures, the laser directs its beam of light 
briefly at the tattoo. It's then absorbed by the pigment of the tattoo until 
the tattoo pops and breaks into smaller pieces that the skin absorbs. 
</P>
<P>
 Karen Benik, one of the doctors credited with keeping the program alive at 
Beckman by donating her services, says the work is gratifying. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember this very angry young man who came in. He had the tattoos on his 
face and neck. And over the course of a year, he really changed. He was 
friendly. It was like an obvious symbol had been taken off of him." 
</P>
<P>
 After Gabriela's first treatment to remove nicknames and lettering acquired 
while hanging with a gang in Anaheim, the 17-year-old student admitted sweetly 
that "it hurt a little bit." But it took the birth her son, Matthew, to realize 
how much pain the gang lifestyle was causing. 
</P>
<P>
 "When my child grows up, I don't want him to make the same mistakes I made. I 
want his life to be different." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Gabriela, who asked that her last name not be used, went to school to 
be a medical assistant and held a job this summer, people still see a gang 
member when her tattoos catch their eye. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm embarrassed. I'm ashamed that they're on me. When I get them off, people 
won't give me faces." 
</P>
<P>
 Gabriela goes back in six weeks for her second treatment, and the tattoos 
should be gone after her third laser procedure. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll be glad when they're gone. A lot of my friends' moms won't let them go 
out with me. They would look at my tattoos. I just want them gone."

THE GREAT BIKER BUST; HOW A COOL DETECTIVE, HER VETERAN PARTNER AND A CHARMING 
FELON CHASED THE HELLS ANGELS RIGHT OUT OF ORANGE COUNTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY WRIDE, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 It's 1970, white eye shadow is still in, and you've just graduated from the 
Orange County Sheriff's Department academy, first in your class. 
</P>
<P>
 Fast forward to 1976. After a rapid rise through the ranks, it's time to 
transfer to an undercover drug detail. 
</P>
<P>
 Meet your new partner, one Wayne Carlander. He's a sunflower-seed-chomping, 
clever veteran who has talked robbers into surrendering and turning over the 
loot, all without moving his 300-pound, 6-foot-6 body from his desk. 
</P>
<P>
 Your first assignment: Pose as the biker girlfriend of a real convicted robber 
and infiltrate the Hells Angels. This means riding around all day on the back 
of a Harley-Davidson, even though you are petrified of motorcycles, hanging out 
in scuddy biker dens with guys named Bruno and Butch, buying drugs and hoping 
nobody recognizes you for the cool blonde detective that you are. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah," says a laughing Veronica Seele, now a happily married out-of-state 
suburban mom and businesswoman who hasn't packed a gun in a decade. "I was 
pretty young and naive and adventurous to do all that, wasn't I?" 
</P>
<P>
 Clinging to the waist of an undercover informant, with Carlander trailing in a 
surveillance vehicle, she helped pull off the biggest undercover operation of 
the time against outlaw bikers. 
</P>
<P>
 And the Hells Angels haven't been back to Orange County since. 
</P>
<P>
 So says "Chain of Evidence" (Dutton, 1994), a book out this month by a 
first-time author who uses the pseudonym Michael Detroit "because the Hells 
Angels might not like some of what I wrote about them." 
</P>
<P>
 He tells the story of how Seele posed as the rich girlfriend of undercover 
informant Cliff Mowery, a parolee enlisted to help infiltrate a fledgling Hells 
Angels chapter in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Carlander, the low-key mastermind of the operation, convinced Sheriff Brad 
Gates that a violent convict could be trusted and that the trio could kick some 
biker butt. 
</P>
<P>
 When the end came eight months later, 125 officers from Orange, Los Angeles 
and San Bernardino counties simultaneously arrested 77 suspects, most of them 
bikers, 19 of them Hells Angels. The police also netted a cache of club 
financial records and membership lists. 
</P>
<P>
 So many cases were scheduled during seven months of trials that judges 
throughout Orange County volunteered to increase their workloads. All but one 
of the 77 defendants were convicted and sentenced to prison. 
</P>
<P>
 "Police penetration of the gang," says the book's prologue, "was accomplished 
by three extraordinary people who paid prices too high. One would die, one 
would flee the state under a different name, and the other would become a 
reluctant hero." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Already, one of the ex-partners is doing national daytime shows. Seele (a 
pseudonym) altered her looks to wing it last week with Joan Lunden on "Good 
Morning America." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the book says the Hells Angels circulated posters promising a $25,000 
reward to killers of the trio, she is no longer skittish about retribution. 
Carlander never did worry much and remains a sergeant with the department. 
</P>
<P>
 A self-effacing investigator, he figures the TV types will be more interested 
in Seele's juicy details. She is, after all, the one who entrusted her life to 
a criminal and partied convincingly with the Angels for eight months. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm certainly not doing this for the money," Seele says of her public 
appearances. "It's certainly not worth compromising yourself in even this small 
way for the money. But this whole (publicity) thing is to give some insight 
into the book, and have some fun. After all, this is entertaining. It's a kick! 
How many people can say that they've done something that turned into a book?" 
</P>
<P>
 That Seele went undetected for so long is impressive, authorities say. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Biker clubs) are very tough to infiltrate," says Ralph Lochridge, spokesman 
for the Drug Enforcement Administration in Los Angeles and a former undercover 
agent. "And it's pretty risky to be found working as an informant (against) the 
Hells Angels. You could get tortured, mutilated, killed. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "That is a remarkable story," Lochridge says, adding that the person who 
introduced Seele to the club deserves a lot of the credit. "To come in cold is 
unheard of." 
</P>
<P>
 Enter Mowery. 
</P>
<P>
 When Carlander first approached him at the Orange County Jail, he looked as 
tough as his rap sheet suggested. A muscular 6-foot-4, with 32 tattoos 
including a hangman's noose on his chest, he was on parole for armed robbery 
when a CHP officer arrested him for carrying a gun. Facing a return trip to 
Soledad state prison, Mowery agreed to Carlander's plot to infiltrate the local 
Hells Angels. 
</P>
<P>
 For eight months, he was kept in a motel -- now called the Key Inn -- visible 
from the Santa Ana Freeway in Tustin. Most nights, Carlander and other 
detectives would eyeball his room from a parked car, making sure he did not 
venture out into trouble. If charm were a felony, Mowery would be doing life 
without parole. That and his good looks made him a magnet for women. At one 
point, an undercover detective caught sneaking out of Mowery's room was fired. 
</P>
<P>
 He had no such effect on Seele, who saw his drunken meanness and capacity for 
violence. Besides, she was happily married to a supportive electrical 
contractor. 
</P>
<P>
 Holding it all together was Carlander. 
</P>
<P>
 "I owe him my life," Seele says in a two-hour telephone interview. "I would 
never have involved myself if it wasn't for (him). Wayne has this incredible 
skill with people. He can sit down and talk to people . . . especially 
convicts, felons. He knew how to deal with them, give them the degree of 
respect that's important to them, and he has perfect timing. He knew when to 
back off, when to apply pressure, when to call their bluff." 
</P>
<P>
 One night when Mowery was acting up, Carlander defused him by suggesting a 
contest to see who could hit a power pole with a rock. And he won. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's Wayne," Seele says, laughing. "He handled that so quick. I would have 
pulled out my gun and shot (him)." 
</P>
<P>
 As she and Mowery ingratiated themselves with bikers, the book says: "They 
made buys in various parts of the county on a daily basis. They would do a deal 
for a gram of meth in Fullerton, ride the chopper to Stanton for three balloons 
of heroin, go to Garden Grove for two grams of cocaine, then take another ride 
to San Bernardino for more meth and a conversation about guns. Or stolen cars. 
. . . (They) would attend parties at bikers' houses or simply hang out in their 
favorite bars." 
</P>
<P>
 Seele posed as Mowery's girlfriend, a rich woman who was selling drugs to her 
homemaker girlfriends until her divorce settlement. The cover story helped her 
retain her innate gentility, although she had to defer to her sidekick around 
others. 
</P>
<P>
 To the undercover team's surprise, Mowery became protective of Seele and made 
it clear that, unlike many of the bikers, he would not be sharing his woman. 
</P>
<P>
 Seele says she even enjoyed a big bar party where she won the wet T-shirt 
contest after some Hells Angels soaked her top. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was young, I was naive, what can I say? I would never do it again today," 
she says with a sigh. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The undercover team knew the operation would end when they suspected someone 
was on to them. That happened one night while Seele and Mowery were buying 
drugs in a couple's home. She was sure the woman, who had once been in jail, 
recognized her from a past encounter. The operation was over. 
</P>
<P>
 Seele slept for long periods and did not leave her house. Days later, the 
sweep began. 
</P>
<P>
 On April 14, 1977, then-deputy Dist. Atty. Ron Kreber (now a judge) took his 
evidence to an Orange County grand jury, which returned 57 indictments against 
77 suspects. All but one of the Hells Angels made bail, and he was extradited 
to Connecticut on a fugitive warrant for murder. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the book, among those arrested was Michael Lee (Bruno) Mason, 
owner of a Santa Ana motorcycle shop where the undercover officer bought drugs. 
The secretary-treasurer of the L.A. chapter, Mason was reportedly the leader of 
the budding Orange County chapter. 
</P>
<P>
 On the day that suspect Ray Glore, sergeant-at-arms of the L.A. club and the 
original target of the investigation, got out on bail, his bullet-riddled body 
was found in the home where he kept files of every Hells Angel in the United 
States and Europe. Police took records that, the book says, were "a huge 
windfall of otherwise impossible-to-get information about the inside operations 
of a secret criminal enterprise." 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels allegedly brought out a New York hit man to take out the cops and 
Mowery, who was hidden in a series of motel rooms until he bravely stared down 
the accused and testified against them. 
</P>
<P>
 Seele did not testify, and the media helped protect her identity by never 
using her or Carlander's real name or photographs. 
</P>
<P>
 Only nine months ago, Carlander transferred to a lower-profile job as sergeant 
of inmate transportation. The father of two girls and a son, he is looking 
forward next year to a life of golf, betting the ponies and playing with his 
grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
 The book, he says, will in some small way give them a legacy. "Can't ask for 
more than that," he adds. 
</P>
<P>
 After two months off to recuperate and consider her future, Seele realized 
that she could continue to move up in the department. Gates, the sheriff, told 
the "Chain of Evidence" author that had Seele stayed with the department, she'd 
be running it today. 
</P>
<P>
 But Seele had no interest in being at a desk, being a boss. And she believed 
she had already cheated fate on the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought, 'Let's not push the odds.' I made it through this. I learned that 
I had some abilities under pressure that I in no way knew I was capable of. I 
had received a tremendous gift and opportunity from the department, but I 
couldn't really use it at the department." 
</P>
<P>
 So Seele quit and changed her name, moving with her husband to another state. 
Just as she launched a "risk management and consulting" business, she 
discovered she was pregnant with the first of three children. After a 
seven-year break, she has returned to her business. 
</P>
<P>
 For months after the busts, she kept her .38 revolver on the shower ledge. 
Once, she almost drew down on her husband when he surprised her in the tub. She 
locks away the guns now. 
</P>
<P>
 Her kids know Mom was a cop, but they'll have to wait to see her videotaped TV 
appearances, or to read "Chain of Evidence." 
</P>
<P>
 "They won't be reading the book for at least a couple more years," she says. 
"Oh, Lord, no. But I'll save an autographed book for them. Autographed, 'From 
Mom.' " 
</P>
<P>
 As for Cliff Mowery, he left too, bound for a job in the Oklahoma oil fields. 
But he later returned and "died in a mysterious motorcycle accident," the 
book's publicist says in a dramatic whisper. 
</P>
<P>
 "Chain of Evidence" ends with Mowery's death in an apparent freeway motorcycle 
crash, but the implication is clear: It might have been a hit on an informant. 
But there is no proof of that.

SURVIVING CANCER

<P>
 * Of the more than 8 million Americans who have a history of cancer, 5 million 
are living five years past their initial diagnosis.  
</P>
<P>
 * Patients who are disease-free for five years have an 80% chance of being 
cured.  
</P>
<P>
 * By 2000, at least 10 million Americans will be cancer survivors. Once 
perceived as a diagnosis of death, cancer today has higher survival rates, 
especially in children and young adults. The result is a growing group of 
long-term survivors who often need help readjusting. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Susan Nessim, president of Cancervive, the population that had 
childhood cancer has the most problems after treatment's end. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have no work history, no health insurance and no support of a husband or 
wife," Nessim says. "They have to get out there and date, often can't have 
children and when they try to adopt, they're discriminated against." 
</P>

 Cast with a graphite fishing rod from an aluminum boat, and you could very 
well catch the big one -- a jolt from above. Nearly 1,500 people are hit by 
lightning every year. Most of the 150 to 300 fatalities are caused by cardiac 
and respiratory arrest. 
</P>
<P>
 Lightning cuts loose at a speed of one-hundredth to one-thousandth of a 
second, with a charge of 50 million to 2 billion volts. Chances of dodging a 
thunderbolt are slim, so stay clear. 
</P>
<P>
 If you're indoors when a lightning storm hits, stay off the phone and away 
from metal window frames and storm doors. If you're driving, stay inside the 
car. Outdoors, avoid shelters that stand in the open. Find low ground. Shun 
single trees. Do not lie flat on the ground. Instead, squat, clasp hands around 
knees, feet together, touching. That way, if a bolt strikes the ground, the 
current will leapfrog over your feet and dive back into the ground. Later, 
folks will be thunderstruck when you tell them about the time you played 
footsie with lightning. Briefly . . .

BODY WATCH; WAIST AWAY; A NEW GENERATION OF DIET DRUGS IS GAINING FAVOR AMONG 
OBESITY EXPERTS. THE LONG-TERM AIDS SEEM TO BE EFFECTIVE -- AND NOT ADDICTIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 No matter which diet Iris Golden tried, success was short-lived. Soon after 
shedding pounds, the 5-foot-2 owner of a Chicago executive search firm would 
return to her pre-diet weight of 250 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Heald, 41, of West Hollywood, understands. At 30, his weight began to 
increase, topping out at 258 pounds and sticking like glue to his 5-foot-7 
frame. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Heald and Golden are both trimmer and, they say, happier. Golden, 57, 
is a Size 10 or 12 and no longer shops for pants with 44-inch waists. Heald, 
who works for a Los Angeles law firm, has dropped more than 50 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Both are disciples of an investigational new treatment approach that views 
obesity as a chronic medical problem, not a willpower deficit. Every day, 
Golden and Heald take medication to control their weight. They also eat a 
healthful low-fat diet and exercise moderately. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's becoming apparent that obesity is a regulatory problem of body fat, just 
like hypertension is a regulatory problem of blood pressure or diabetes is a 
regulatory problem of sugar," says Dr. Frank Greenway, a UCLA associate 
clinical professor of medicine and a leading national obesity researcher. 
</P>
<P>
 Like many hypertensives and diabetics, obese people need chronic medication, 
Greenway and others contend, not the traditional 12-week regimen of appetite 
suppressants usually prescribed. 
</P>
<P>
 Not everyone agrees with this new pill-a-day approach, but it is gaining 
favor, especially among obesity experts. At the 7th International Congress on 
Obesity last month in Toronto, many research papers focused on these so-called 
new generation diet drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the medicines under study are a new combination of two old appetite 
suppressants, antidepressants and a drug that lets some fat from foods pass 
right through the body. Some drugs under study could be approved as obesity 
treatments in three years or less, researchers estimate. 
</P>
<P>
 Traditional diet drugs have a bad reputation, Greenway says, based on older 
generation medicines that could be addictive and cause people to get "jittery." 
But the newer medications are not addictive, he says, and have been studied for 
longer terms. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 This interest in long-term diet medications is peaking at a time when obesity 
is rampant and failure is the norm in weight maintenance. About 30 million 
Americans are obese, defined roughly as being 20% or more above ideal weight. 
Obesity may increase risk for heart disease, diabetes, osteoarthritis and other 
ailments. 
</P>
<P>
 About 95% of those who enroll in organized weight loss programs regain the 
weight, according to the National Institutes of Health, most within one to 
three years. 
</P>
<P>
 The pill-a-day approach received a big boost two years ago when a University 
of Rochester study of appetite suppressants, published in Clinical Pharmacology 
and Therapeutics, was picked up by the press. In short order, 5,000 requests 
for more information flooded the university, recalls spokesman Robert Loeb. 
</P>
<P>
 In the study, a new combination of two old appetite suppressants, phentermine 
(Ionamin) and fenfluramine (Pondimin), helped some of the 121 subjects lose 
weight when they also followed a program of dieting, exercise and behavior 
modification, found Dr. Michael Weintraub, formerly at the University of 
Rochester and now director of the Food and Drug Administration's Office of OTC 
Drug Evaluation. 
</P>
<P>
 During one 34-week phase, subjects assigned randomly to appetite suppressants 
lost 32 pounds on average while those assigned to placebo pills lost only 9 
pounds. Then doses and regimens were varied. Taking suppressants intermittently 
didn't work as well as taking them continuously. Some on the suppressants 
maintained the loss for as long as they remained on the regimen, which was up 
to 3 1/2 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Not all patients lost weight and there were some side effects -- most common 
in the early months -- such as dry mouth, nausea and diarrhea. 
</P>
<P>
 Fenfluramine affects a brain chemical called serotonin; phentermine affects 
chemicals called catecholamines. "They both cause people to eat less and to 
lose weight," explains Dr. Richard Atkinson, professor of medicine and 
nutritional sciences at the University of Wisconsin, Madison. 
</P>
<P>
 During the last 20 weeks of the four-year study, when everyone discontinued 
the medication but kept dieting and exercising, "almost everyone regained all 
the weight," Weintraub found. 
</P>
<P>
 For the past two years, Dr. Roy Blank, an internist in Charlotte, N.C., has 
supervised more than 1,200 people on the same regimen used by Weintraub, 
getting government approval to do so. (In many states, use of these drugs for 
more than 12 weeks is illegal.) At the one-year mark, his subjects -- the vast 
majority women -- have lost on average about 15% to 20% of their beginning body 
weight. Besides taking the daily medication, his subjects follow a 1,200 to 
1,500 calorie diet and exercise moderately for about two hours a week. 
</P>
<P>
 "The key point is, these medicines are a supplement to what else we are 
doing," Blank says. The drugs cost his patients about $50 a month. (Other 
researchers can't say for sure what their regimens will cost once approved.) 
</P>
<P>
 Blank warns potential subjects about the possibility of gallbladder problems, 
associated not with the medicines per se but with the weight loss. "In the last 
two years, 22 people have had to have their gallbladders removed," he says. In 
addition, depression became so severe in about 30 patients, he says, that they 
were taken off the diet drugs and placed on antidepressants. 
</P>
<P>
 Blank is collaborating on the analysis of his data with Atkinson, of the 
University of Wisconsin and a well-known obesity researcher. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, others are studying sibutramine, originally developed as an 
antidepressant. A two-year study, involving 1,050 patients, is now entering the 
second year at seven sites, says Greenway, one of the investigators. The 
highest sibutramine dose given -- 30 milligrams a day -- has resulted in a 
20-pound weight loss at the six-month mark, says Greenway, with weight loss 
continuing after that time. The sibutramine, he adds, "might work like a 
combination of fenfluramine and phentermine." Insomnia is often reported as a 
side effect. 
</P>
<P>
 Another antidepressant, Prozac (fluoxetine), might also suppress appetite. 
After studies suggesting its value as a weight control aid, Prozac's 
manufacturer, Eli Lilly and Co., sought Food and Drug Administration approval 
in 1988 to market it under the brand name Lovan as an obesity treatment, a 
representative says. But the request has not yet been approved, says FDA 
spokeswoman Susan Cruzan. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lilly request is controversial because some who took the drug for 
depression have sued, claiming it can lead to violent behavior and even suicide 
attempts. But physicians who prescribe it regularly claim that those reactions 
are in the minority. Lilly contends that violent behavior does not increase 
with the drug's use. 
</P>
<P>
 Another drug, orlistat, works by minimizing the amount of fat absorbed from 
food, says a representative for Hoffmann-La Roche, the developer. Orlistat 
binds to pancreatic lipase, an enzyme secreted by the pancreas to help break 
down fat. As a result, about a third of a dieter's fat intake passes undigested 
through the body. Studies are continuing. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Not everyone believes long-term medication is the answer. Treating obesity can 
do more harm than good, psychologist Janet Polivy of the University of Toronto 
told participants at the Congress on Obesity. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because we do not know how to define which sorts of obesity are medically 
dangerous, decisions to treat are based more on weight than on actual risk," 
she says. The obese should obtain a physical exam to rule out other causes of 
excess weight, Polivy says, and then should "evaluate their eating and their 
exercise and find a weight appropriate for them." 
</P>
<P>
 Even advocates of the approach urge caution. 
</P>
<P>
 The regimens are all considered investigational, Greenway points out. "If you 
want in on this," he suggests, "get involved in a trial" -- in which patients 
are closely monitored for progress or side effects. 
</P>
<P>
 Agrees Atkinson: "These drugs should be used as part of a research project. 
This does not mean private practice doctors can't prescribe (them)." Rather, 
Atkinson urges obese patients to find doctors well-acquainted with the new 
approach and who work with researchers to document findings and patient 
progress.

BODY WATCH; THE TRAUMA OF BUYING THE RIGHT HOME PREGNANCY TESTING KIT; IT'S 
EXPENSIVE AND HARD TO LOCATE -- NEVER MIND THE HUMILIATION AT THE CHECKOUT LINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LAYNE STEINHELPER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES

<TEXT>
<P>
 When it comes to home pregnancy testing, you owe a lot to your childhood 
chemistry set. Not that it takes much technical skill to set up your own 
urinalysis mini-lab -- minimal motor coordination is about all that's required. 
</P>
<P>
 No, the crucial lesson you learned was that your lobbying efforts ("I won't 
blow anything up, Mom, honest !") proved considerably more challenging than the 
experiments themselves. Miss a period and you'll discover that, like your 
anticlimactic chemistry set, the sprint to the bathroom and ensuing 
three-minute wait are mere addenda to the gantlet you run from the moment you 
step through the pharmacy door. That's where you realize that years of 
experience as a Kotex consumer (remember those gigantic boxes?) do not prepare 
you for the transition to pregnancy tester. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only are you in unfamiliar territory, but the ante has been upped: These 
kits are expensive. Presumably in an effort to persuade you they are not, the 
boxes offer a confounding array of two-pack discounts, instant coupons and 
mail-in rebates. If you're budget-minded, the packages demand considerable 
analysis. Bring along your calculator -- or your accountant -- assuming you can 
find the kits at all. 
</P>
<P>
 Only diligent surveillance will reveal whether you're in search of a 
gender-specific Feminine Needs aisle (this female needs appreciation, love, 
some help in the kitchen and equal pay for equal work, none of which are 
available here), or a more egalitarian Reproductive Health counter. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically enough, your goal may very well be the Baby Care display -- where 
one can only suppose the marketing strategy targets harried mothers who, 
loading up on talc and formula, might impulsively grab a kit to see if they're 
in for another round of Mommydom. 
</P>
<P>
 Chances are, you'll end up in the euphemistically dubbed Family Planning 
center. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite its hygienic title, no white-coated professional waits to counsel you. 
Instead, just when you should be deciding whether your mood calls for the 
alchemy of mysterious vialed compounds or one-step efficiency, a suddenly lurid 
condom display will appear before you. 
</P>
<P>
 At the exact moment you should be facing a crucial issue like stick versus 
cup, you'll start to wonder if passersby think you're really weighing the 
relative merits of natural golden ribs versus mint flavored latex. 
</P>
<P>
 Admittedly, none of this should matter. It's nobody's business if you do want 
to make a studied prophylactic selection. And anyone who cared to speculate 
must already suspect you're no virgin. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe the problem is that your mind-set is more "newborn baby" than "French 
tickler." Maybe it's because the last thing you want to be reminded of is the 
sort of activity that brought you to this impasse in the first place. Whatever 
the reason, it does matter. It can matter to the point that you're reduced to 
seizing a kit, any kit, just to escape. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Not until you reach the checkout line will you realize that you're clutching 
nothing but your pregnancy kit. Then your mushrooming paranoia renders you 
telepathic. You know what people are thinking. That woman in the power suit is 
wondering how another member of her sex could exercise such pathetic lack of 
control over her reproductive destiny. The guy in the T-shirt is thinking, 
"Slut." 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, in a rational moment, you might concede that neither of these people is 
even marginally interested in your reproductive status, but this is not time 
strong on rationality. 
</P>
<P>
 The mood is oddly reminiscent of Tampon Purchases, the Early Years, when a 
trip to the drugstore could take hours while you pretended to read magazines 
until the teen-age male clerk went on break. Or a jaunt turned into a trek 
because you had to lay in a basketful of decoy sundries to divert attention 
from the little blue box buried at the bottom. 
</P>
<P>
 At this point in your life, though, you probably refuse to acknowledge your 
insecurity by picking up extraneous shampoo and toothpaste to disguise the true 
nature of your mission. In my own phenomenal maturity, I simply make sure my 
wedding ring is prominently displayed to the clerk, the customer behind me in 
line, and whoever it is that monitors those security cameras . . . and I hope I 
don't have to pawn that band of gold to pay for the kit.

CASSANDRA WILSON, THE JAZZ VOCALIST, LAUGHS AT LIMITS; SINGER: SHE'S 
COMFORTABLE WITH HIP-HOP, ROCK, BLUES OR BOP AND REFUSES TO ACCEPT CONVENTIONAL 
WISDOM ON MARKETING HER CAREER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD REED, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Cassandra Wilson, the alleged jazz vocalist, was driving through her home 
state of Mississippi recently. She pulled into a Stuckey's and heard, over the 
tinny speakers that seem always to fill a place with the dopiest of tunes, a 
musical inspiration -- a compelling sound that locked her happily in place. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't Charlie Parker, whose blazing bop vocabulary in the mid-1980s 
"possessed" Wilson. Neither was it the bold and inventive Betty Carter, of whom 
Wilson might be considered a free-form legatee. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Hank Williams Sr., the daddy of country crooners, balladeer of the 
broken, fixer of Southern hearts, dimestore poet of longing and hope. 
</P>
<P>
 Twang. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson delights in such a seemingly dissonant event. It is the kind of thing 
that girds her argument that American music -- whether jazz, country, blues, 
hip-hop or rock 'n' roll -- has no boundaries, suffers no Balkanized turf, goes 
unyoked by even the savviest marketer's idea of the segmented audience. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Wilson is the first to admit, "I just don't see the differences 
anymore." As a result, little in American music seems safe anymore from the 
roving Cassandra Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 That is good news, as jazz fans and, increasingly, mainstream audiences have 
come to learn. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson went from being a Brooklyn jazz rebel in the mid-1980s to one of the 
finest interpreters of traditional jazz ballads in the late 1980s to the 
release of a hip-hoppish CD in 1989 to her current hit, a year-old Blue Note 
recording that dispenses with the jazz trio format altogether.  
</P>
<P>
 That CD, titled "Blue Light 'Til Dawn," sets Wilson's mahogany alto, fat and 
slow as molasses, against an anorexic backdrop of pedal steel guitar, 
accordion, bass -- and in one over-dubbed a cappella instance, nothing at all. 
Her voice fills all the spaces between the instruments, like a thick fog in the 
forest. The songs are Robert Johnson blues; Van Morrison, Joni Mitchell and 
Stylistics pop; and jazz-tinged Wilson originals. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the person herself, the session is a highly original stew that reaches 
well beyond jazz's walls and whose naked debt is to all the influences an 
unbound American youth could gather growing up in Jackson, Miss., in the 1960s 
and 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
 This, and whatever else the peripatetic Wilson is up to, will be amply 
displayed in performances Thursday night at the Strand in Redondo Beach. This 
will follow by one day her appearance at the Belly Up in Solano Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 These shows will be anything but the anomalous appearances of a budding and 
musically correct jazz vocalist. They precede a monthlong European tour that 
includes headlining at London's Royal Albert Hall; the release of two tribute 
CDs, one to the music of the former Prince and another to Van Morrison, 
featuring her renditions of "When Doves Cry" and "Crazy Love," respectively; 
and the Thanksgiving release of the Arnold Schwarzenegger-Emma Thompson movie, 
"Junior," in which Wilson is filmed singing "I've Got You Under My Skin." 
</P>
<P>
 In recent months she has done the vocals for Wynton Marsalis' big-band 
composition "Blood on the Fields." 
</P>
<P>
 If anyone is humbled by her success, it is Wilson. In a conversation that 
hip-hops from the lean, heartfelt artwork of Romare Bearden (a Wilson favorite) 
to the movie "To Kill a Mockingbird" (it "still haunts," she says) to the 
problems of living a sane life in New York ("I go home to Jackson, Mississippi, 
a lot, to stay grounded"), Wilson ponders the terrible question of what, 
precisely, she does in her music. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's too soon for me to say what I'm doing," she says. "That is, I'm 
not sure. It's evolving." 
</P>
<P>
 Her voice trails off for a moment, then takes things to their most basic 
level. She cites the importance of her home in Jackson, where she grew up 
listening to her jazz guitarist father, Herman Bradley Fowlkes, and his epic 
record collection. Where the very air of Jackson and the South was filled with 
the blues. Where her time in college was defined by musical appetites that 
embraced not only jazz and blues but Motown and rock and folkies such as Bob 
Dylan. Where to this day she feels "much freer than anywhere else." 
</P>
<P>
 She would move to New Jersey and then New York and fall in with a Brooklyn 
collective known as M-BASE, a loose-knit cabal fluent in Manhattan's bop and 
mainstream vocabularies but which chose to challenge convention by 
experimenting with time, key and alternative urban voicings. Among these 
pilgrims were the now front-line saxophonist Steve Coleman and pianist Geri 
Allen. They sought a music that would forever get them off a stuck-in-time 
"Green Dolphin Street." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson's passage was peculiarly personal. "Blue Light," her ninth album, is 
clearly her first in what could be called a truly original voice: a soulful, 
slippery form of singing that cuts close to the bone and employs whatever 
musical genre or structure it takes to support it. Some of it is jazz, some of 
it blues, some of it a seemingly ancient cadenced verse -- with all of it 
forming its own distinct language of tone, spaciousness, understated 
spirituality. In jazz's greatest tradition, it is bold and free of constraint 
and yet sprouted from so many roots. 
</P>
<P>
 The intimacy of the music owes, Wilson says, to the fact that she makes no 
effort to divide music from her life. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just getting to the point where I'm in touch with my emotions," she says. 
"What's important is singularizing an emotion and building upon it musically. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm moving beyond technique. This helps me to open up and pull from my 
experience and be vulnerable in my music. It's important to get closer to that 
kind of expression so that, as an artist, (you) can give a particular take on 
reality." 
</P>
<P>
 She pauses a moment. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am happiest when people are moved, when a spiritual presence is felt, when 
they sense God." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson considers the weight of her words. A gap in the conversation fills with 
the echo of those who took like inner journeys to find original expression 
using the musical forms around them, if not always with the spiritual bent: 
Charlie Parker, Miles Davis, John Coltrane, Betty Carter. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's why my music has thrown some people for a loop," she says. "I just 
don't see differences in forms of music. There really isn't all that much 
difference in all the music created in America. "What am I doing? There's 
nothing to base it on or compare it to. All I can say is that it's do-able and 
possible and real -- because I'm doing it." 
</P>
<P>
 That's certainly an air-tight deduction. But where others had slower routes to 
recognition -- and, save Davis, hardly any notice outside jazz -- Wilson has 
far surpassed home-run sales on "Blue Light" with more than 100,000 copies 
sold. To make matters more un-jazz, mainstream Capitol Records, which owns Blue 
Note, promotes Wilson with a real budget. 
</P>
<P>
 Even Capitol, however, can't be sure what to expect from the protean Cassandra 
Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson just doesn't know how else to proceed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Capitol certainly has come to the party," she says. "I am happy about that. 
But I keep threatening to show up one day in jeans and with a guitar -- and 
they'd drop dead at that. 
</P>
<P>
 "The truth is, all I can do is let the record company know what's coming. 
That's what happened on 'Blue Light.' And right now, I don't know. 
</P>
<P>
 "Things are in change. Life and music are in change. I'm just expanding on the 
sounds in my ("Blue Light") band and my life at this very moment."

'TIMECOP' ACTRESS SCALING NEW HEIGHTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANNE BERGMAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In "Timecop," the latest Jean-Claude Van Damme action thriller, actress Mia 
Sara hangs off an icy roof in her bathrobe, clinging only to a bent TV antenna. 
While terrifying, Sara admits this stunt was nothing compared to filming a love 
scene with Van Damme . . . without the bathrobe. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was nervous," Sara says, when asked about her on-screen romantic pairing 
with the action star. "Wouldn't you be with Captain Physique, Mr. Body himself? 
I just kept saying, 'Keep the camera on Jean-Claude, keep it away from me, just 
show my foot! Show my foot and his butt and nothing else!"' 
</P>
<P>
 You'd think a beauty like Mia Sara would have nothing to be nervous about, 
especially when you consider that she has been in this business for more than 
half of her 27 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Sara, a Brooklyn native whose father is a photographer and her mother a 
stylist (and yes, that is their real surname), began appearing in commercials 
by the time she was 13. At 16, she played the princess who enchants Tom Cruise 
in "Legend," and at 17 she was Ferris Bueller's game-for-adventure girlfriend 
in "Ferris Bueller's Day Off." 
</P>
<P>
 By the venerable age of 19, Sara found herself a leading lady in the ABC 
miniseries "Queenie," which was loosely based on movie actress Merle Oberon's 
life. Queenie is the sort of role Sara would love to sink her teeth into now. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm older and I know more," Sara says from the back yard of her Los Angeles 
home. "I've been really studying hard these past few years, trying to learn 
more about acting, and I've been getting better, I've been getting looser." 
</P>
<P>
 Sidney Lumet had enough confidence in her to cast her as a young Hasidic woman 
in "Stranger Among Us," a role for which Sara says she "worked really hard to 
get." "It was a character role," she continues, "and I don't ever get to 
audition for character roles. People just don't see me that way -- I usually 
play the ingenue, the leading lady, and so often the second-banana role is 
really great." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the fact that Sara has been steadily busy over the years, she 
confesses that the elusiveness of stardom has been frustrating. "Thank God for 
'Ferris Bueller's Day Off,' for if it weren't for that no one would remember 
me!," Sara says with a laugh, before pausing and adding, "But I think I haven't 
been ready (for stardom), I think I'm much more equipped to handle it now than 
I was a few years ago." 
</P>
<P>
 Interviewed just after completing a fashion shoot for British Esquire and mere 
hours before she hopping on a plane to St. Petersburg, Russia, to begin filming 
"Bullet to Beijing" with Michael Caine, Sara finally seems poised for the 
spotlight. Gracious despite the fact she's not done packing, Sara sees both 
"Timecop" and the recently finished "The Maddening" as welcome departures from 
her usual roles. 
</P>
<P>
 For "Timecop," which has been No. 1 at the box office for the two weeks of its 
release, she got a chance to test her courage, which inspired her to get her 
pilot's license. "I loved doing the action . . . though I don't think I'm going 
to become a Lady Van Damme," Sara says glancing down at her delicate frame. 
"But I did climb up that roof and hang off that antenna -- that was me!" 
</P>
<P>
 "Timecop" director Peter Hyams cast Sara as Van Damme's damsel in distress 
after meeting with her a few times. "I knew she was a terrific actress, except 
that's all I knew," Hyams says by phone from Pittsburgh, where he's completing 
pre-production on another Van Damme movie, "Sudden Death." 
</P>
<P>
 Sara's performance went beyond Hyams' expectations. "Oddly enough, it's a 
difficult part to play," he says. "There she was in the freezing weather with 
tons of water being poured on her, and she kept acting the whole time. It's so 
easy to feel self-conscious and hold back, but she sold the danger, the plight 
she was in." 
</P>
<P>
 Cast again as a woman in danger, Sara will play a young mother held hostage by 
Burt Reynolds and Angie Dickinson in "The Maddening," which is set for release 
next February. Sara describes the film as "sort of like 'Whatever Happened to 
Baby Jane' plus 'Misery.' I'm chained to the bed for over half the film."  
</P>
<P>
 And in "Bullet to Beijing," which will debut on Showtime, Sara plays a Russian 
spy who finds herself involved with the Russian Mafia after the Cold War is 
over. 
</P>
<P>
 While Sara may be on the brink of receiving the attention she has been working 
so hard for, she maintains a very un-Hollywood lifestyle, living with her 
fiance, actor-producer Clayton Rohner, and two Wheaton terriers in a 
comfortable fixer-upper in Hancock Park, which the couple is remodeling 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's face it, it's a silly job sometimes," Sara says of being an actress. "I 
mean, you're an adult and they dump water on you and tell you to climb up the 
roof in the freezing cold rain wearing a bathrobe. And you do it! "

DO NOT OPEN 'TIL, ER, NOVEMBER; CRUSH OF NEW, STARRY FILMS FORCE STUDIOS TO 
LAUNCH CHRISTMAS FARE EARLIER. THE HOPE: BEST YEAR'S TOTAL EVER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 There are a full 89 shopping days left until Christmas but for the motion 
picture industry, the holidays officially kick off in a little more than a 
month. The opening salvos are "Mary Shelley's Frankenstein" from TriStar 
Pictures, starring Robert De Niro, and Universal Pictures' coming-of-age drama 
"The War," pairing Elijah Wood and Kevin Costner. Both films debut Nov. 4. 
</P>
<P>
 Wait a second. Isn't that rushing things a bit? 
</P>
<P>
 Not as far as MCA/Universal motion picture group chairman Tom Pollock is 
concerned. When he went to one of the better department stores last weekend, 
Christmas decorations were already up. If retailers continue to move the season 
up earlier and earlier, he contends, there's no reason why the movie business 
can't do it too. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, points out Disney marketing president Robert Levin, the holiday 
season is a bit of a misnomer. Unlike summer, which witnesses a consistent 
attendance expansion from Memorial Day through Labor Day, the end of the year 
holiday window delivers a business rush only in fits and starts: for about five 
days around Thanksgiving and another week between Christmas and New Year's Day. 
</P>
<P>
 It makes sense then, he says, to get as many playing days for such films as 
his studio's "The Santa Clause," starring Tim Allen, and 20th Century Fox's 
remake of "Miracle on 34th Street." Both will be out prior to Thanksgiving 
because Christmas-themed movies usually peter out after the calendar 
celebration of the holiday. 
</P>
<P>
 However, many of the coming season's significant early releases won't be 
Yuletide titles. "Frankenstein" will make haste to get established with 
audiences a week before the arrival of another florid monster movie, the much 
ballyhooed "Interview With the Vampire" starring Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt. The 
Samuel Goldwyn Company will open David Mamet's sexual harassment drama 
"Oleanna" nationally on Nov. 11 to get some attention before another similarly 
themed film, "Disclosure," starring Michael Douglas and Demi Moore, arrives in 
December. 
</P>
<P>
 The largely animated "The Pagemaster" debuts Nov. 11, a week before New Line's 
animated "The Swan Princess." ("Pagemaster" features super-tyke Macaulay Culkin 
who also stars in Warner Bros.' December release "Richie Rich.") 
</P>
<P>
 Other early-in-the-season "big gun" titles include Paramount's "Star Trek: 
Generations," Disney's re-release of "The Lion King" and Universal's Arnold 
Schwarzenegger-Danny DeVito comedy "Junior." 
</P>
<P>
 "There is so much new movie product this season that the so-called Christmas 
season has grown to accommodate the crush of new films," says Howard Lichtman, 
spokesman for the Toronto-based Cineplex Odeon theater chain. 
</P>
<P>
 If the front-loading strategy of releasing so many films so early works, says 
Tom Boris of box-office tracking firm Entertainment Data Inc., those films 
could raise the overall attendance level through to the end of the year. If it 
doesn't, there will be the inevitable back-to-the-drawing-board re-evaluation. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, exhibitors are buoyed by this steady flow of releases -- about 35 films 
in all -- observing that as many as a dozen have the potential to gross from 
$50 million to more than $100 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The line-up of commercially viable product for the holidays is as strong as 
it's ever been, according to Fox's distribution chief Tom Sherak, whereas last 
year was largely dominated by the family films "Mrs. Doubtfire" and "Aladdin." 
</P>
<P>
 A strong holiday season could ensure the shattering of 1993's box-office 
record tally of $5.2 billion. Through the end of this past summer, business was 
almost 5% ahead of last year. And it's shaping up to be a better than average 
fall, say exhibitors and distributors. 
</P>
<P>
 With more playing days for the "big gun" holiday titles, industry executives 
are hoping this year's increase in ticket sales will continue unabated, making 
1994 the best performer ever. Of course, as with every year "you better have 
the goods, or you should get out of the kitchen," cautions Sherak about the 
upcoming holiday slate. And there will undoubtedly be some last-minute 
defections. New Line Pictures, however, has made a last-minute addition to the 
season with the Jim Carrey comedy "Dumb and Dumber." 
</P>
<P>
 Originally scheduled for release in 1995, the company took the plunge at the 
behest of exhibitors. "The trailer was playing gangbusters," says Chris Pula, 
head of marketing at New Line, which also released Carrey's $100-million-plus 
comedy hit "The Mask." The company's distribution chief, Al Shapiro, began 
receiving phone calls from theater chains asking him to move up the date since 
there was no broad-based comedy appealing to the young male demographic at 
Christmas. "Dumb and Dumber" debuts Dec. 16; Jean-Claude Van Damme's action 
film "Streetfighter" is its main competition. 
</P>
<P>
 For more sophisticated laughs there's Nora Ephron's "Lifesavers," starring 
Steve Martin, and two romantic comedies: Paramount's "I.Q.," teaming Meg Ryan 
and Tim Robbins, and MGM/UA's "Speechless," starring Michael Keaton and Geena 
Davis. The latter could benefit from comparisons to the real-life political 
romance between James Carville and Mary Matalin. 
</P>
<P>
 More adult-oriented fare usually waits until Christmas Day to open, when its 
constituency becomes available. But, observes MGM/UA marketing head Gerry Rich, 
this year Christmas falls on a Sunday, robbing the industry of one holiday 
weekend (Christmas Eve and most of Christmas Day are normally box-office low 
points for moviegoing). That makes it all the more crucial to establish a film 
before the Christmas weekend. Hence, the stacking of releases on Dec. 16 and 
23. 
</P>
<P>
 What seems to be missing this Christmas is the usual line-up of Oscar-worthy 
prestige movies. With the exception of Fox's drama "Nell," starring Jodie 
Foster, and Warners' baseball biography "Cobb," starring Tommy Lee Jones, there 
don't seem to be any major studio releases on the order of last year's 
"Schindler's List," "Philadelphia," "Remains of the Day" and "In the Name of 
the Father." 
</P>
<P>
 It's just the luck of the draw, say industry nabobs. Such directors as Steven 
Spielberg, Martin Scorsese, Jonathan Demme and Jim Sheridan, who can be counted 
on to deliver potential Oscar offerings, didn't make a film this year. Others 
like Barry Levinson and Neil Jordan ("The Crying Game") have tackled more 
overtly commercial projects, "Disclosure" and "Vampire," respectively. 
</P>
<P>
 There will be several independently-made Oscar hopefuls, including Roman 
Polanski's drama "Death and the Maiden," starring Ben Kingsley and Sigourney 
Weaver, Robert Altman's fashion satire "Pret-a-Porter," with an all-star 
ensemble cast, the inter-generational saga "The Perez Family," with Anjelica 
Huston and Marisa Tomei, and "Mrs. Parker" with Jennifer Jason-Leigh in the 
title role as writer Dorothy Parker. 
</P>
<P>
 Barring last-minute surprises, many of the stronger best picture hopefuls may 
already have been released, suggest insiders -- Disney's "Quiz Show" and "The 
Lion King," Paramount's "Forrest Gump" and Gramercy's "Four Weddings and a 
Funeral."

<P>
 An adaptation of Bram Stoker's "Dracula" will open the Grove Theater Center's 
four-play maiden season, the latest attempt to revive the city's downtown arts 
scene. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dracula," to open Oct. 29 at the 172-seat Gem Theatre, will be followed by 
David Paterson's "Finger Painting in a Murphy Bed" on March 22; Shakespeare's 
"A Midsummer Night's Dream" on June 17 at the 550-seat outdoor Festival 
Amphtheatre, and Lanford Wilson's "Talley's Folly" on dates to be announced. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, the City Council gave GTC artistic director Kevin Cochran $32,000 
in seed money and a management contract calling for 175 performances a year. 
Cochran said in addition to GTC's own four productions, other local presenters 
will stage musicals, children's theatricals and dance, jazz, folk and comedy 
shows. 
</P>
<P>
 He has not announced a budget for his season but says GTC presentations will 
be produced under agreements with Actors' Equity Assn. and the Society of Stage 
Directors and Choreographers that call for a number of union professionals to 
work in each of its shows. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dracula" will be adapted and directed by Cochran. "Finger Painting" will be 
the world premiere of a play that Cochran says he has staged in a workshop. 
</P>
<P>
 Subscriptions range from $56 to $80. Single tickets will be $18.50 to $24.50. 
Performances at the Gem will run Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m., Saturdays at 
3 and 8 p.m., and Sundays at 7 p.m. Amphitheater performances will run 
Thursdays to Sundays at 8 p.m.

HOLDING THE LINE; LA HABRA PAIR REFUSE TO RELENT IN FACEOFF WITH GANGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By REBECCA TROUNSON and MIMI KO, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The walls and windows of Dorothy Rush's neatly painted Grace Avenue home speak 
eloquently of her war with the gangs. 
</P>
<P>
 Three bullet holes in her bedroom wall. Three more in the window of her 
workroom. Pockmarked plaster where another bullet grazed the front wall. And a 
still-gaping hole where a Molotov cocktail crashed through a bedroom window 10 
days ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is scary," conceded Rush, a retired dressmaker reborn as an anti-gang 
activist. "When the police say, 'These people intend to kill you,' it makes you 
think a little about what you're doing." 
</P>
<P>
 But not enough to stop. 
</P>
<P>
 Rush and her husband, Larry, say the recent attacks on the home where they 
have lived for 30 years have only hardened their determination to rid their 
neighborhood of the gang violence, graffiti and run-down housing that plague 
parts of it. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the repeated targeting of her home -- six incidents, including two 
drive-by shootings, since the first of the year -- also has helped propel 
Dorothy Rush into a race for the La Habra City Council. Rush said she was 
motivated in part by frustration with the continuing presence of gangs in her 
neighborhood and with the city officials she claims have done little to control 
the area's violence and blight. 
</P>
<P>
 "All I want to do is clean up this city and make it a better place to live," 
she said. "This whole city is going to pot." 
</P>
<P>
 Rush's dogged efforts have won her admirers, especially among longtime 
residents of her aging, two-block street. But her often confrontational methods 
also have created enemies, not all of them gang members. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, several Grace Avenue residents expressed confusion and anger about 
the "lady on the corner" who calls police about people drinking beer in their 
front yards, or simply hanging out, listening to music and talking with 
friends. Others openly accused Rush of racism, claiming her actions result from 
a failure to understand the culture of the area's many Latino residents. 
</P>
<P>
 At the center of the controversy is a diminutive 60-year-old, a woman who 
greets first-time visitors to her home with a wary smile and a quick glance 
past the doorway to the street beyond. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm really watching my back right now," Rush explained, seated at a table 
below a window marred by bullets during a Sept. 4 drive-by shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 Rush said her activism, and her troubles, began March 29, 1992, when she 
organized a Neighborhood Watch program, the first of three community groups she 
has started in an attempt to clean up her Grace-Pacific neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Hours after the first meeting, her husband's Nissan truck was shot several 
times and spray-painted with, "(expletive) the watch." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For nearly two years, as Rush became increasingly active, her home continued 
to be the target of relatively minor attacks that police investigators told her 
were gang-related. The house frequently was egged. Bottles were thrown at the 
walls and windows. And often, when Rush and her husband drove down the street, 
the young men who congregated outside in the evening would yell epithets as 
they passed. 
</P>
<P>
 Last January, though, the violence escalated after Rush helped an elderly 
property owner evict a troublesome tenant, she said. Although the tenant and 
her family finally handed over the keys just before a court hearing aimed at 
forcing them out, the woman made it clear she believed Rush was responsible. 
</P>
<P>
 "She said, 'This is your fault and you're going to be sorry,' " Rush said. The 
tenant has since moved from the area and could not be contacted last week. 
</P>
<P>
 That night, Jan. 27, several shots were fired through Rush's kitchen window. 
The next month, the house was spray-painted with graffiti and a bicycle 
sprocket was thrown through a window. In April, cinder blocks crashed through 
the bedroom window, bruising Rush's back as she lay in bed and grazing her cat. 
</P>
<P>
 In early September, after several months of relative quiet, the front of the 
house was sprayed with gunfire. That was followed on Sept. 16 by the most 
frightening incident, Rush says, when a still-smoldering bottle filled with 
gasoline was tossed through her bedroom window in the middle of the night. 
</P>
<P>
 La Habra Police Chief Steve Staveley said he has no doubt that at least some 
of the incidents are linked to Rush's anti-gang efforts. But he said they may 
have been committed by people with varying motives. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mrs. Rush has been identified by some as being responsible for improving the 
community, and they don't like it because they liked it the way it was," 
Staveley said. "If you're a gangbanger, you don't want the neighborhood to 
change for the better." 
</P>
<P>
 He and others said they do not believe the attacks are related to her 
candidacy for a council seat in the Nov. 8 election. 
</P>
<P>
 "The reason for the targeting is pretty clear," said Mayor David M. Cheverton, 
one of Rush's four opponents in the election. "Mrs. Rush has stated it's her 
intention to clean up the neighborhood and get the gang kids to go somewhere 
else. And the city administration and City Council are behind her in that 
1,000%." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Rush remains critical of the administration, however, saying it has moved too 
slowly in effecting change. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're disappointed she feels that way," responded Deputy City Manager Kathy 
Kim, noting that two city task forces have targeted the area in the past two 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, many residents on Grace Avenue last week said life there has improved 
considerably in recent years. Gunshots are no longer a nightly occurrence, they 
say, and drugs aren't dealt as brazenly on street corners. 
</P>
<P>
 One recent evening at dusk, children played on the street's rutted sidewalks, 
adults chatted over front-yard fences and an ice cream truck made its way 
slowly down the street, its tinny melody hanging on the cool evening air. 
</P>
<P>
 "It feels a lot safer now," said Nancy Castro, 17. "I grew up here with a lot 
of the guys who are gangsters now and it feels better now. Before we didn't 
come outside so much, but now it's OK." 
</P>
<P>
 Castro and several others credited Rush, along with the police department's 
anti-gang efforts and the city's increasing emphasis on forcing absentee 
landlords to bring decrepit buildings up to code. 
</P>
<P>
 The street now contains an eclectic mix of single-family homes, duplexes and 
multiple-family dwellings. In several cases, run-down buildings with overgrown 
yards are bordered by houses with flowers, fruit trees and carefully-trimmed 
patches of green. 
</P>
<P>
 "It used to be a real trashy mess here," said Dorothy Clobes, 69, who has 
lived on Grace Avenue since 1965. "(Rush) has really tried hard. She's gotten a 
lot of us to work together to try to make things better." 
</P>
<P>
 Not everyone on Grace Avenue is a fan. While all interviewed, including those 
identifying themselves as gang members, said they deplored the attacks on 
Rush's home, many took issue with her methods, describing them as harsh and 
unnecessarily combative. The anger against Rush does not excuse the violence, 
several said, but it may help explain it. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "She comes on too strong," said Craig Bird, 33, a two-year resident. "She gets 
very much in a confrontational mode with the gang members and with the 
slumlords." 
</P>
<P>
 He and other neighbors also said Rush was partly responsible for a 
controversial anti-blight ordinance that is expected to come before the council 
in the next few weeks and which, in its early drafts, sought to ban 
clotheslines that were visible from the street. 
</P>
<P>
 Rush, an active proponent of the ordinance, said she never intended to 
prohibit clotheslines but to keep people from hanging their laundry from trees 
and fences. 
</P>
<P>
 But the proposal sparked instant controversy. Many residents said it 
discriminated against Latinos and the poor. The ordinance is being revised. 
</P>
<P>
 Several of her neighbors last week pointed to Rush's role in that dispute and 
her anti-gang efforts as evidence of racial bias, a charge Rush adamantly 
denies. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was never anything racial about what I do," Rush said. "I don't see any 
problem as far as what race is living here. . . . I just want some decent folks 
where kids don't have to be scared to go outside." 
</P>
<P>
 Araceli Maciel remains unconvinced. 
</P>
<P>
 Rush "doesn't want to see any Latinos in this neighborhood," said Maciel, 32, 
a six-year resident of Grace Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 She said Rush was too quick to call the police, often over minor infractions. 
</P>
<P>
 "This community needs help," she said. "They don't need only rules. They need 
programs, they need food, they need jobs. But Dorothy, she doesn't think like 
that. She calls the cops." 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, Maciel said, the violence against Rush is inexcusable. "I worry 
for her," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rose Espinoza, a community activist who runs a tutoring program from her 
garage, is one of Rush's opponents in the November election. She too once was 
targeted by gang members, but the harassment ended soon after she began helping 
neighborhood kids with their homework, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 She and Rush "both want to change the neighborhoods," Espinoza said. "But what 
she's doing, the gang members don't see as helping them. And until she finds a 
way that is going to help them, it's not going to stop, unfortunately." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Dorothy and Larry Rush have dismissed suggestions from friends and 
relatives that they simply move away from the troubled area.  
</P>
<P>
 "This is my home," Dorothy Rush said. "I don't want to give it to the gang 
members." 
</P>
<P>
 "People have to have the fortitude to stand up," added her 62-year-old 
husband. "It may cost a life sometimes, but that happens in a war. And this is 
a war."

GAS STATION OWNERS PLEAD NO CONTEST TO 54 CHARGES; CRIME: PROSECUTOR SAYS 
COUPLE SOLD TAINTED FUEL, FAILED TO PAY $24 MILLION IN TAXES, ILLEGALLY DUMPED 
WASTE AND IGNORED CONTAMINATION FROM LEAKING TANKS. 
</P>

<P>
 An Anaheim Hills couple who owned and operated more than 200 gas stations in 
Southern California pleaded no contest Monday to failing to pay $24 million in 
state taxes, illegally disposing of hazardous waste and selling gas that was so 
bad it made engines die. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Lazar, 46, and his wife, Divine Grace, 40, also refused to do anything 
when gasoline from leaking tanks contaminated soil and ground water, and 
conspired to falsify tests, said Deputy Dist. Atty. Anthony G. Patchett. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were running a pretty big scam," Patchett said. "They were really 
working the system. And they almost got away with it. They were selling bad 
gas. They used to get lots of complaints from people saying 'My car is dead!' " 
</P>
<P>
 The couple, who have been in custody for nearly a year, faced up to 12 years 
in prison and $800 million in fines and restitution. Under the terms of a plea 
agreement with prosecutors, the couple now face up to eight years in prison 
when they are sentenced Oct. 21 in Los Angeles Superior Court on 54 criminal 
counts, Patchett said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a lot of evidence that they knew exactly what was going on," 
Patchett said, explaining why prosecutors filed criminal charges rather than 
seeking remedies through the civil court system. "The evidence was just so 
blatant. When they learned about contamination, they just kept pumping gas and 
making money." 
</P>
<P>
 The case is the first in which Los Angeles County prosecutors have used felony 
charges to penalize gas station owners for violating state standards and 
avoiding taxes, Patchett said. He said he plans to ask that the couple pay 
nearly $800 million in fines, an amount that could set a record for an 
independently owned business. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys for the couple could not be reached for comment late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple pleaded no contest to 46 counts pertaining to sales fax fraud and 
selling substandard gasoline, six counts of improperly disposing of hazardous 
wastes, one of conspiring to falsify tank tests and to other charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Patchett said the Lazars' businesses were so successful that one year they 
made more than $160 million. They also manipulated the system to avoid paying 
millions in taxes on cigarette sales and gas profits, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities say the investigation began in 1990 when officials noted that 
yearly tank tests indicated none of the Lazars' tanks had leaks. Generally, 
underground tanks experience some leakage. 
</P>
<P>
 The exact amount of restitution is to be determined after the trial of three 
co-defendants, including an attorney and two accountants who worked for the 
couple and are accused of conspiring to file false state tax returns, Patchett 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple operated California Target Enterprises, Alameda Management Co. 
Inc., Pronto Marketing Co., P&M Service Stations and Challenge Marketing, the 
prosecutor said. 
</P>
<P>
 The investigation of the Lazars involved auditors from the State Board of 
Equalization, Department of Special Taxes and Operations, Department of Food 
and Agriculture's division of measurement standards, Environmental Protection 
Agency and Air Resources Board.

FAMALARO ENTERS NOT GUILTY PLEA; COURTS: OCT. 17 HEARING IS SET FOR MAN CHARGED 
WITH MURDER AND KIDNAPING OF HUBER. GRAND JURY INDICTMENT IS POSSIBLE; 
PROSECUTORS STILL MAY SEEK THE DEATH PENALTY. 
</P>

<P>
 A handyman accused of killing a young Newport Beach woman and keeping her nude 
body in a freezer for three years pleaded not guilty Monday to the charges 
against him, including allegations that make him eligible for the death 
penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 John J. Famalaro stood behind a glass courtroom partition during the brief 
hearing in Municipal Court in Newport Beach as his lawyer entered a plea of not 
guilty to charges of murder and kidnaping. 
</P>
<P>
 Municipal Judge Craig Edward Robison set a preliminary hearing for Oct. 17 to 
determine if there is sufficient evidence to order that the 37-year-old former 
Lake Forest man be bound over for trial in Superior Court. He is charged in the 
murder of Denise Huber, whose baffling disappearance in 1991 sparked a massive 
search that made her name a household word in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 The district attorney's office, however, could circumvent the public hearing 
process by obtaining a grand jury indictment, which precludes the need for a 
preliminary hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Christopher J. Evans would not comment on the possibility 
that a grand jury indictment would be sought in the case. Deputy Public 
Defender Brian Ducker, one of two defenders representing Famalaro, said he has 
been notified that the district attorney might use the grand jury, but did not 
know for sure if that would happen. 
</P>
<P>
 Famalaro, one of the county's most notorious murder suspects, has been held 
without bail in protective custody in Orange County Jail since his extradition 
earlier this month from Arizona. Huber's body was discovered in a freezer that 
Famalaro kept running in a rental truck parked in the driveway of his Prescott 
Country Club home in that state. An electrical cord extended from the freezer 
to Famalaro's house. 
</P>
<P>
 Ducker said outside the courtroom Monday that he is satisfied with measures 
taken by the Sheriff's Department jail staff to protect Famalaro, who has been 
the subject of verbal death threats by other inmates. Famalaro is being held in 
a single-person cell and is escorted by an Orange County sheriff's deputy 
whenever he leaves it, officials have said. 
</P>
<P>
 Huber, then 23, was a UCI graduate working as a waitress and department store 
clerk when she vanished June 3, 1991, after attending a rock concert in 
Inglewood. Her car was found with a flat tire on the shoulder of the Corona del 
Mar Freeway in Costa Mesa, less than two miles from her parents' Newport Beach 
home, where she was living. 
</P>
<P>
 Her disappearance remained a mystery until July 13 of this year when Arizona 
authorities, tipped that the rental truck had been reported stolen when 
Famalaro failed to return it on time, made the gruesome discovery. 
</P>
<P>
 Arizona deputies forced open the truck, believing that Famalaro had concealed 
drugs or drug-processing equipment in it. Instead, they found the freezer 
containing Huber's body. 
</P>
<P>
 Famalaro already pleaded not guilty to the killing in Arizona, where he was 
originally charged with murder before jurisdiction in the case was transferred 
to California. Orange County authorities sought to have his case transferred 
here after they discovered traces of Huber's blood in a Laguna Hills storage 
facility, where Famalaro was living at the time of her disappearance. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities believe Famalaro lured Huber into his car, possibly under the 
guise of helping a stranded motorist, and then later bludgeoned her to death in 
the storage facility.  
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Evans declined to comment Monday on whether the autopsy or 
other tests indicated that Huber had been sexually assaulted. 
</P>
<P>
 Ducker also declined to talk further about the case and his client, saying he 
and co-counsel Leonard Gumlia are still reviewing some 4,000 pages of police 
reports and other documents. He said he's expecting another 5,000 to 6,000 
pages of documents. 
</P>
<P>
 Famalaro could face the death penalty or life in prison without the 
possibility of parole if convicted of the charges against him. But a committee 
of Orange County prosecutors who decide which cases warrant death penalty 
treatment have yet to make a decision in Famalaro's case.

PARENTS TO FACE FINES FOR CURFEW VIOLATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC BAILEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An Orange County lawmaker's bill requiring parents to pay a fine if their 
children repeatedly violate curfew laws was signed by Gov. Pete Wilson.  
</P>
<P>
 The measure by Assemblyman Tom Umberg (D-Garden Grove) is designed to allow 
cash-strapped local governments to recoup the administrative and transportation 
costs of returning a minor home after arrest. It also is aimed at fighting 
juvenile crime by making adults more accountable for the whereabouts of their 
children after hours. 
</P>
<P>
 "This bill sends a clear message to parents that they have a responsibility 
not just to their children, but to the community in which they live," Umberg 
said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, many cities have enacted curfew laws, including Mission 
Viejo, Laguna Beach and Huntington Beach, but have had trouble enforcing them 
because of the time and number of officers required to arrest youths and drive 
them home. Instead, police have focused on more serious crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 Umberg's measure is intended to make a dent in proliferating teen-age gang 
activity as well as the growing number of sexual and violent crimes against 
children by adults, Umberg said. Such crimes, Umberg said, "require that we 
take the steps necessary to get children off the streets and hold negligent 
parents responsible for keeping them off." 
</P>
<P>
 Under the law, an initial violation requires that a parent or guardian be 
mailed a warning that they could be fined if their child is picked up again. 
The new law also allows governments to waive the charges if parents can prove 
they have made reasonable efforts to exercise control over the child, can 
demonstrate an inability to pay or if an adult chooses to perform community 
service in lieu of the fee. 
</P>
<P>
 Existing teen curfew laws in Orange County generally ban youngsters under 18 
from unsupervised activities between 10 p.m. and 5 a.m. or 6 a.m. Organized 
activities like football games, movies and theme parks are excluded from most 
curfews. 
</P>
<P>
 Of particular concern to authorities are public areas like malls, streets or 
beaches. Enforcement is usually discretionary, and officers have a choice of 
giving warnings or citations. First offense fines in Orange County, levied 
against the youths rather than the parents, range from $25 to $50. 
</P>
<P>
 While the amount of the fines under Umberg's bill will be up to each city or 
county, the bill stresses that the fines must reflect the actual cost of the 
officer's time and any other costs involved.  
</P>
<P>
 Umberg's bill was supported by the Orange County Chiefs of Police and 
Sheriff's Assn., the Orange County Gang Prevention Alliance, the Chief 
Probation Officers of California and the League of California Cities. 
</P>
<P>
 In a separate action, Wilson signed a bill from Sen. Marian Bergeson 
(R-Newport Beach) that increases the maximum prison sentence for domestic 
violence to five years and raises the maximum fine to $10,000. 
</P>
<P>
 It also increases the penalty for inflicting great bodily injury from three 
years to a maximum of five years and imposes a mandatory 30-day jail term for 
anyone who violates a restraining order twice within a year.

 Grace Church is sponsoring a two-day, anti-pornography seminar Sunday and 
Monday. It is free and open to the public. 
</P>
<P>
 The sessions, at 5100 Cerritos Way, are 4 to 7 p.m. Sunday and 7 to 9 p.m. 
Monday.Janet La Rue, of the National Law Center for Children and Families, will 
be among the speakers. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rev. Ron Jackson, one of the church's pastors, said the seminar reflects a 
growing concern about "the spread of pornography throughout our local 
communities." 
</P>
<P>
 He said City Council members have been invited to attend. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pornography has a devastating effect on the men who purchase such materials," 
Jackson said. "Women and children are usually the victims of pornography, 
either through the debased pictures and stories in such material, or worse yet, 
through the acting out of such behavior upon our wives and children. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our families need the protection of the laws of our land as well as an 
informed body of community leaders."

 HUNTINGTON BEACH Woman Accepted to Coast Guard Academy 
</P>
<P>
 Lisa Elizabeth Knopf is headed for the high seas -- sort of. 
</P>
<P>
 The daughter of Richard and Shirley Knopf of Huntington Beach has been 
accepted as a cadet at the United States Coast Guard Academy. 
</P>
<P>
 Knopf is a distinguished honor graduate of Edison High School and was one of 
274 people sworn into the Coast Guard Academy Class of 1998 in July. She is one 
of 59 women accepted into the academy this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Knopf's acceptance is a significant accomplishment, since appointments are 
given based solely on merit, with nationwide competition. This year, more than 
5,000 applicants competed for the 275 positions in the class of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
 Knopf will undertake a four-year training and education program at the New 
London, Conn., academy. Upon completion of the program, she will receive a 
bachelor of science degree and a commission as an ensign in the U.S. Coast 
Guard.

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; DISTRICT'S PARENTS GIVE SCHOOLS HIGH MARKS IN 
POLL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A poll has found that 85.3% of parents of public high school students in 
Huntington Beach, Fountain Valley and Westminster are generally satisfied with 
the high school system. 
</P>
<P>
 The poll, from Management Support Services of Fountain Valley, was conducted 
in June and involved a random survey of 481 parents. 
</P>
<P>
 The Huntington Beach Union High School District, which operates all the public 
high schools in the three-city area, commissioned the survey. 
</P>
<P>
 Supt. David Hagen said the survey is part of the high school district's 
long-range, strategic plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our strategic plan calls for a 90% satisfaction level over the next few 
years," Hagen said. "We are now at 85.3%, which is a good place to begin." 
</P>
<P>
 Results of the poll were discussed at the district's school board meeting last 
week. Gayle Wayne, owner of Management Support Services and supervisor of the 
poll, told the school board that high percentages of parental approval are 
especially hard to attain at the high school level. 
</P>
<P>
 Wayne said parents generally have a "tendency to blame the high school" for 
any problems that come to their maturing children. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Huntington Beach Union High School District, she said, parents 
generally were supportive of many aspects of the school system. 
</P>
<P>
 The poll found that 71% of the parents thought the high schools were safe, and 
72% had a positive response about district discipline policies. A total of 81% 
of those polled said they believe the high schools are turning out "responsible 
citizens." 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, Hagen said, the poll showed areas where improvement is needed, 
including that of parental satisfaction with students' career preparation. Only 
51.5% of those polled said the high school system's career-preparation programs 
met their expectations.BILL BILLITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 There won't be two streets bearing the name of Ganado anymore. 
</P>
<P>
 That's because the Ganado with a "Drive" affixed to it is being changed to 
Calle Arroyo. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council approved the name change last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Only six residences will be affected by the switch for the 300-foot-long 
street between La Novia Avenue and Moonglow Lane. 
</P>
<P>
 The name change was prompted by some Ganado Drive residents' complaints that 
emergency personnel had trouble finding an address there because the city also 
has a Ganado Road. JEFF BEAN

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: DANA POINT; CITY ASKS PUBLIC INPUT ON USE OF GRANT FUNDS

<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council is calling for citizen input to decide how to spend federal 
housing improvement grant money. 
</P>
<P>
 Two public meetings have been scheduled to discuss and establish a list of 
community needs and projects for federal Community Development Block Grant 
funds. 
</P>
<P>
 The first session is Thursday at 6 p.m. at City Hall, 33282 Street of the 
Golden Lantern. The second meeting will be Oct. 6. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to community-wide projects, the federal assistance program helps 
low-income families and individuals pay for home improvements. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our primary objective is to benefit low- and moderate-income families," said 
Ed Knight, the city's community development director. "This includes the 
development of decent, safe and sanitary housing and a suitable living 
environment, (along with) expansion of economic opportunities." 
</P>
<P>
 Knight added that grants are available to meet "those needs of a particular 
urgency which may threaten the health and welfare of the community." 
</P>
<P>
 Since it incorporated in 1989, the city has received $567,000 in federal block 
grant funds. 
</P>
<P>
 In particular, city officials said, they hope to see residents from the city's 
two older sections, Lantern Village and Doheny Village, attend the meeting.

 Police announced Monday that they had arrested 48 people in a prostitution 
sting operation. 
</P>
<P>
 The undercover operation Friday night targeted men soliciting sex along a 
four-block stretch of East 1st Street, the site of numerous resident complaints 
about prostitution, said Santa Ana police Sgt. Ed Andrade. 
</P>
<P>
 Five female officers posed as prostitutes during the seven-hour operation. Men 
were arrested when they drove up and offered to pay for sex, Andrade said. They 
were being held at the city's jail facility on suspicion of soliciting 
prostitution and had their cars impounded, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The sweep in Santa Ana follows recent anti-prostitution operations in Costa 
Mesa and Anaheim.KEN ELLINGWOOD

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: YORBA LINDA; PLAN FOR HIGHWAY IRKS SOME RESIDENTS

 First, Caltrans called it a Super Street, then a Smart Street. 
</P>
<P>
 Now some residents and local business owners say the planned widening of 
Imperial Highway will result in nothing more than a freeway that will cut 
through the center of town. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't be fooled!" proclaimed a flyer posted around town. "The people at 
Caltrans are talking about a 55-m.p.h. speed limit. 
</P>
<P>
 There will be six lanes from Los Angeles to Lakeview (Avenue), four lanes from 
Orangethorpe and eight lanes to Anaheim Hills. That's a freeway."  
</P>
<P>
 Several City Council members complained at a recent meeting that Caltrans and 
the city's engineering department were nearing completion of preliminary plans 
without guidance from the council or input from residents and business owners 
in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 "The train has already left the station on this, and the council wasn't on 
board," Councilman Mark Schwing said. 
</P>
<P>
 City Engineer Roy Stephenson said the road project will not be a freeway and 
that he has worked aggressively with Caltrans to ensure that the project 
receives as much funding as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's not enough money for all the Smart Street projects," Stephenson said. 
"Those agencies that are most aggressive will most likely get the money they 
need to get the project they want." 
</P>
<P>
 Merchants on Main Street don't want any project that includes widening 
Imperial Highway and increasing speeds to 55 m.p.h. Motorists traveling that 
fast are not likely to turn down their street, business owners there say. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even with the speed limit (on Imperial) at 40 miles per hour, many people in 
Yorba Linda don't know we are here," said Forrest Holdeman, whose wife is a 
partner in a gift and antiques store on Main Street. "Imagine what it will be 
like when it's 55 miles per hour." 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council is expected to schedule a public hearing on the project. The 
hearing will be next month at the Yorba Linda Community Center, 4501 Casa Loma 
Ave. DANIELLE A. FOUQUETTE

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: IRVINE; FERGUSON TO TALK ON TOLL ROAD ISSUES

 Assemblyman Gil Ferguson will take his campaign against the planned Newport 
Coast Drive toll booths to the City Council tonight, warning city officials to 
prepare for a flurry of lawsuits that could have a dramatic effect on the 
amount of traffic flowing through the city. 
</P>
<P>
 But Irvine Mayor Michael Ward says Ferguson's timing is flawed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not too happy about him testifying, because I don't think it's the proper 
time," Ward said. The council will review an environmental impact report in 
January on the realignment of three major Irvine roads in conjunction with the 
planned San Joaquin Hills toll road, Ward said. "He's way ahead of the deal." 
</P>
<P>
 The council has not put the subject of the toll road on tonight's agenda. 
Ferguson will speak during the public comment period at the council meeting, 
which begins at 5:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The Newport Beach Republican is a longtime opponent of the plan to require a 
50-cent toll on a 1 1/2-mile segment of Newport Coast Drive, which would 
prevent free access on the road from Irvine to the beaches of Newport. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just going to tell them to be vigilant, so that when the lawsuits start 
they'll know where they stand," said Ferguson, 71, who is leaving the state 
Assembly to run for the seat now held by state Sen. Marian Bergeson (R-Newport 
Beach). Bergeson will retire from the Senate in January to succeed retiring 
Orange County Supervisor Thomas F. Riley. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Ferguson has tried unsuccessfully to get legislation passed to block 
the toll booths planned for Newport Coast Drive, he contends that lawsuits 
could result in favorable court action. 
</P>
<P>
 "The court can force the (Transportation Corridor Agencies) to remove tolls 
from previously free roads," Ferguson said. "They can do this because there 
have been several similar cases in the history of California. There's a lot of 
toll road laws already on the books." RUSS LOAR

<TEXT>
<P>
 A review of various dress code policies in the Newport-Mesa Unified School 
District could lead to a districtwide policy on student clothing, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 However, district trustees have no immediate plans for a policy 
change.Trustees will discuss the policies of various district schools at a 
meeting tonight, Assistant Supt. Robert Francy said. 
</P>
<P>
 A recent state law allows school boards to opt for uniforms if they decide the 
matter is a safety issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Dress codes within the Newport-Mesa district vary from school to school. Some, 
such as Newport Harbor High School and Ensign Intermediate School, have 
single-paragraph, general guidelines for school attire. Others, like Tewinkle 
Middle School, have detailed rules, such as: "Overalls must be worn with both 
shoulder straps fastened." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Francy cautioned against expecting a change anytime soon, district 
spokeswoman Nadine Wilck said that parents at three elementary schools -- 
Pomona, Whittier and Wilson -- have suggested uniforms for their schools and 
are surveying other parents. HOLLY J. WAGNER

<P>
 The City Council will have another public hearing today to consider whether to 
allow a group home for abused women and children in an upscale Anaheim Hills 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 After protests from neighbors, the council postponed a decision in August 
about the Eli Home's proposal to renovate a run-down building on .22 of an acre 
at the southeast corner of Santa Ana Canyon Road and Canyon Crest Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 The nonprofit organization, which has been honored by the last two U.S. 
Presidents, offers emergency shelter and counseling to victims of abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 The Eli Home will submit new architect's plans for the proposed project today. 
The council delayed a decision in August after concerns were raised about the 
design and safety of the Eli Home proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors also complained that the shelter's presence would "devastate" their 
community by bringing in more traffic and the potential for violence. Neighbors 
said they are afraid an angry spouse may attack someone at the shelter or in 
the neighborhood.

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: ORANGE; ANTI-GRAFFITI REWARD PROGRAM GETS FUNDING 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Residents who see a familiar face defacing property could earn some extra 
bucks with a phone call. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council last week agreed to set $5,000 aside to reward residents who 
help police convict graffiti vandals.Callers could receive $100 to $500, 
depending on the crime, according to Police Chief John R. Robertson. 
</P>
<P>
 "The more (the taggers) did, the higher the rewards, so to speak," Robertson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The department has rewarded seven people for information since the program 
began last year. Graffiti in the city has decreased since the program began, 
Robertson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Those convicted of tagging generally serve 100 to 150 hours of community 
service, pay a $100 fine, make restitution if they are able and lose driving 
privileges for a year. 
</P>
<P>
 The county spends about $24 million annually painting over graffiti, Robertson 
said, adding that the city spent about $100,000 last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are real pleased with what is going on in Orange," he said. "We have more 
community service time available than graffiti to paint over." LESLEY WRIGHT

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: ORANGE; UNION WORKERS REJECT SCHOOL CONTRACT OFFER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Orange Unified School District board members had planned to sign a 
long-overdue contract with the California School Employees Assn. last week but 
instead went back to the bargaining table. 
</P>
<P>
 Both union and district negotiating teams had accepted a tentative contract, 
but it was voted down by the rank-and-file, 70 to 66. 
</P>
<P>
 The last stumbling block is a clause added by the district that would give 
retirees a supplemental plan for Medicare, said Becky Mayers, president of the 
local CSEA. The union said the plan was inadequate and asked that the clause be 
removed. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is not a cost issue," Mayers said. "It would not cost (the district) one 
red cent to take that out." 
</P>
<P>
 Jack Elsner, personnel director for the district, would not comment in detail 
on the insurance clause but said the issue was not "insurmountable." 
</P>
<P>
 About 1,200 employees in the district have been working under a contract that 
was unilaterally imposed by the district last spring. A 10-day strike in May 
failed to win workers any concessions. 
</P>
<P>
 The contract under negotiation would last until September, 1995. It does not 
offer any raises but does reduce some large employee deductions for benefits, 
Mayers said.LESLEY WRIGHT

NEW GARDEN GROVE PROGRAM FOCUSES ON TRUANCY PREVENTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 School and police officials will soon begin a program aimed at preventing 
students from ditching classes, district officials have announced. 
</P>
<P>
 The three-year program is designed to offer counseling, crisis intervention 
and tutoring for at-risk students, said Alan Trudell, a spokesman for the 
Garden Grove Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
 Garden Grove police Capt. David Abrecht said the program is crucial not only 
to keep youngsters in school but also to curb youth violence. 
</P>
<P>
 "Truancy is the most significant indicator of kids who go on to commit a crime 
of violence. We decided to take a step back and address the issues that lead to 
violence," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The "Truancy Drop-In Center" will be staffed by counselors from Orange County 
Youth and Family Services, a nonprofit agency and partner in the program. The 
program is funded by a $50,000 state grant, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The center, based at Louis Lake High School, will open Monday. It is expected 
to reach about 200 youngsters each year, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the program, police will pick up children they suspect are truant and 
transport them to the center, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Counselors will then start to look into their attendance and education 
background," Abrecht said. "They will call parents and start to work on a plan 
to get this kid back in school."

CONSULTANT FAULTS COUNTY REPORT ON BOLSA CHICA PLANS; DEVELOPMENT: THE 
ENVIRONMENTAL DATA ON THE ALTERNATIVES TO KOLL COMPANY'S HOME-BUILDING PROJECT 
IS CALLED 'POORLY ORGANIZED AND CONFUSING.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A city consultant charged Monday that Orange County's environmental assessment 
of its own development proposals for the Bolsa Chica wetlands is flawed and 
incomplete, and called on the county to prepare a new one. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Steven Roseman, who was hired by the city to evaluate the county's latest 
environmental impact report, said it is "poorly organized and confusing" and 
doesn't address some basic issues of potential environmental effects. 
</P>
<P>
 The charge came at an informal public hearing before the City Council on the 
revised EIR. That report was supposed explain the impacts of development 
proposals recently suggested by the county as alternatives to the Koll Real 
Estate Group's development plans. 
</P>
<P>
 No representatives from the county were present at the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 This latest twist Monday caused Councilman Earle Robitaille to storm out of 
the council meeting, indicating he was fed up with the bureaucracy of it all. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't take any more. I'm going to pack up and go home," he said. Robitaille 
said the city has wasted thousands of dollars on consultants to review and 
evaluate the EIRs.  
</P>
<P>
 The Koll company proposes to build 4,286 homes on 400 acres of the bluffs and 
lowlands and restore 1,100 acres of wetlands. The plan calls for construction 
of a road transecting the area and a $20-million tidal inlet connecting the 
wetlands to the ocean as part of the restoration effort. 
</P>
<P>
 The county's plans would drastically reduce the number of homes built and 
offer options for wetlands restoration in the lowland. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the county's lowest-density plan, homes could not be built on protected 
areas, which would relieve the Koll company of restoring the wetlands. The plan 
for a maximum number of 3,200 homes calls for some development on lowland 
marshes and restoration of the remainder of the wetlands. 
</P>
<P>
 The county's proposal also does not include a restoration plan with a tidal 
inlet, which has been criticized by some environmental groups.  
</P>
<P>
 The Amigos de Bolsa Chica, however, favors a tidal inlet and prefers the Koll 
plan over the county's. The Amigos, a wetlands protection group, considers a 
tidal inlet critical for a high quality wetlands restoration, said Terry 
Dolton, former Amigos president. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier Monday, the Amigos held a news conference at the Talbert Marsh inlet, 
an area they hope will serve as inspiration to those planning the future of the 
Bolsa Chica wetlands. 
</P>
<P>
 The Amigos group has proposed creating a similar tidal entrance at the 
southern end of Bolsa Chica, executive director Adrianne Morrison said. The 
inlet would not be at the site of a natural inlet that existed in the 1850s in 
the area of present-day Warner Avenue. To place it there would be too 
disruptive to outer Bolsa Bay, Morrison said. 
</P>
<P>
 The restoration plan in the county proposal focuses on channel widening and 
increased water flows through Anaheim Bay that would result in undesirable loss 
of habitat at Bolsa Chica, Morrison said. It also could create water quality 
problems in Huntington Harbour, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But another group, the Surfrider Foundation, opposes any inlets. 
</P>
<P>
 "The ocean inlet plan was scrapped because it is an environmentally 
destructive, $20-million boondoggle that will destroy the Huntington cliffs and 
destroy the wetlands," Surfrider spokesman Gordon Labedz said.  
</P>
<P>
 Two other hearings will be held this week in the city to give the public the 
opportunity to comment on the revised environmental impact report. The report's 
45-day public comment period ends Oct. 6. 
</P>
<P>
 An even bigger crowd than Monday's is expected at a formal public hearing 
before the county Planning Commission at 4 p.m. Wednesday in the City Council 
Chambers. 
</P>
<P>
 A third meeting will be at 7 p.m. Thursday, hosted by the Huntington Beach 
Waterways & Beaches Committee. The informal meeting will be at the Huntington 
Harbour Yacht Club on Warner Avenue, just east of Pacific Coast Highway.

COUNTY UNABLE TO FIND FOSTER HOME FOR ABUSED BOY; SOCIAL SERVICES: PROSPECTIVE 
PARENTS ARE LEERY OF THE PUBLICITY SURROUNDING THE CASE OF ALLEGED TORTURE AND 
THE SPECIAL MEDICAL CARE THE 10-YEAR-OLD NEEDS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 County Social Services officials said Monday that they are running into 
difficulty finding foster parents for the 10-year-old boy whose aunt has been 
charged with torturing him at her home in Orange earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Griffith, deputy director of the Orange County Social Services Agency, 
said Monday that some would-be foster parents are unwilling to take the boy 
into their home because of the publicity surrounding the case and his current 
need for special medical care. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the boy's uncle, 45-year-old Edward Medina, was arraigned Monday in 
Municipal Court in Santa Ana on three counts of felony child abuse, each 
carrying a sentence of two to six years in prison. Prosecutors allege that he 
did nothing to stop his wife, 31-year-old Cynthia Medina, from abusing the 
child on Sept. 7. 
</P>
<P>
 According to authorities, Cynthia Medina flew into a rage after she suspected 
the boy had been playing with her marijuana cigarettes. They say that in order 
to punish the child, Medina seared the boy's tongue with knives heated on the 
stove, beat him with an electrical cord and sodomized him with a miniature 
baseball bat. 
</P>
<P>
 They allege that Medina was in another room when the abuse occurred and 
refused to intervene despite his nephew's cries for help. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the boy's injuries were so severe, Cynthia Medina has also been 
charged with torture -- the first such case filed in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Medina says the boy's injuries resulted from a "freak" accident, according to 
her attorney. The Medinas also are charged with abusing their 9-year-old son, 
who officials have placed at Orangewood, the county facility for abused and 
neglected children. 
</P>
<P>
 The nephew has been in the hospital since Sept. 8 after having had emergency 
surgery. His condition has improved, and he is ready to leave the hospital, 
officials said, though he still requires special medical attention for his 
abdominal injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 The publicity generated by the case, however, has discouraged some potential 
foster parents, according to social services officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had a couple of foster parents turn us down flat, saying this case is 
not one they feel they would be able to handle," Griffith said, adding that the 
boy's medical needs have also made it difficult to find him a suitable, 
temporary home. 
</P>
<P>
 Social services officials are also in the process of trying to determine who 
the child should live with further down the road. They expect to make a 
recommendations for longer-term placement to a juvenile court judge within the 
next few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 The child's maternal grandmother and his father are locked in a custody 
dispute, social services officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Deputy Dist. Atty. Charles J. Middleton said a preliminary hearing 
in Edward Medina's case has been scheduled for Friday at 9 a.m. in Orange 
County Municipal Court. 
</P>
<P>
 Middleton said he wants to try the two cases together to spare the boy the 
ordeal of having to testify twice.

LOCAL ELECTIONS / IRVINE CITY COUNCIL; AIRPORT AT EL TORO WON'T FLY, ALL 6 
CANDIDATES AGREE; A BUSINESS PARK, SHOPPING COMPLEX OR TRANSIT CENTER WOULD BE 
PREFERABLE, THEY SAY. OPTIONS FOR THE MARINE BASE, WHICH BORDERS THE CITY, ARE 
A KEY CAMPAIGN ISSUE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 In the June issue of Money magazine, Irvine was named the safest large city in 
the country. That was about the same time that Taco Bell Corp., after a 
nationwide search for friendlier environs, opted to keep its corporate 
headquarters in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 So as City Council elections near, the candidates -- who say they want to 
maintain Irvine's reputation for safety and make the city as "business 
friendly" as possible -- tend to focus on what could go wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 And what could go wrong in Irvine? 
</P>
<P>
 Something almost too horrible for most Irvine residents to contemplate: El 
Toro International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 All six council candidates oppose turning the El Toro Marine Corps Air Station 
into a commercial airport. But even if an airport is never built, the scheduled 
1999 closing of the base will have a significant impact on this master-planned 
community and has become a key campaign issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Suggestions have been made that the base, which borders Irvine, could be used 
for a homeless shelter, a federal prison, a job training headquarters and a 
regional transportation center. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those sound great individually," said Councilman Greg Smith, 45, the owner of 
an auto parts business in Orange. "But if you combine all those together, you 
may end up with something in total that generates as much traffic as an airport 
does." 
</P>
<P>
 Smith and incumbent Barry J. Hammond, a business mediator, are running for 
reelection against challengers George Gallagher, president of the Irvine 
Conservancy, college student Gilad Ganish and computer programmer David Burt. 
Mayor Michael Ward is running unopposed. 
</P>
<P>
 Burt, 26, said that although he would rather see the Marine base turned into a 
business park or a shopping center, the decision must be dictated by property 
rights.  
</P>
<P>
 "I am not opposed to an airport," Burt said. "Whoever makes the highest bid 
should be allowed to do what they want with the land." 
</P>
<P>
 Ward, 48, said he opposes Measure A, which asks voters to decide whether the 
Marine base should be converted to a commercial airport. More information is 
needed before a decision can be made, according to Ward, who endorses the 
ongoing examination of the issue by the El Toro Reuse Planning Authority. 
</P>
<P>
 "How can you put an airport at El Toro to a vote if you don't have the 
information?" Ward said. "It's planning by ballot box." 
</P>
<P>
 Gallagher, 33, is in favor of creating a residential and commercial community 
at the El Toro Marine base in conjunction with a county transit center that 
would offer transportation alternatives. But he also is using the airport issue 
to challenge the sincerity of Hammond's opposition to a commercial airport at 
the military base. Gallagher points out that Measure A proponent Buck Johns was 
a major contributor to Hammond's unsuccessful Republican primary bid to succeed 
Assemblyman Gil Ferguson (R-Newport Beach). 
</P>
<P>
 "When Hammond speaks to business groups in Newport Beach, he says an airport 
must be considered," Gallagher said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hammond, 42, denied the charge, saying he has always been candid about his 
opposition to a commercial airport at El Toro. 
</P>
<P>
 "Buck Johns supported me because I was the best candidate for the race, 
despite the fact that we vehemently disagreed on what should be done with the 
Marine base," Hammond said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hammond has proposed that USC relocate to the Marine base, though even he 
thinks it is "highly unlikely." If it did happen, he said, the interchange 
between UCI and the private university would be good for the community and 
probably not generate excessive traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 Other than the USC idea, Hammond said he is not a proponent of any particular 
use for El Toro. "I'm anxious to see other people's creative ideas," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ganish, an 18-year-old Irvine Valley College student, is also opposed to the 
proposed conversion of the military base to an airport. He is the son of Haym 
Ganish, the man who has been battling the city for 12 years over the remodeling 
of his Kron Street house into a kind of urban castle. For Gilad Ganish, most 
issues pale in comparison to what he calls the "inhumane" actions of city 
officials who are seeking court permission to tear down his parents' house. 
</P>
<P>
 "The City Council needs a bit of humanity," Ganish said. "There's no doubt in 
my mind that I've had more experiences with the city than anybody."

BOARD GIVES TEACHERS A 2% PAY HIKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Westminster School District Board of Education has unanimously approved a 
2% raise for its teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 The board made its decision at its regular meeting last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the new pay schedule, a starting teacher will make $23,933 a year, up 
from $23,464. A teacher who has been with the district for 10 years will earn 
$46,191, up from $45,286, district spokeswoman Audrey Brown said. The salary 
terms, which are retroactive to July 1, will remain in effect until June 30, 
1996. 
</P>
<P>
 The district's teachers last received a raise -- of 3% -- in the 1992-93 year, 
Brown said.

GRAND JURY INDICTS IRVINE MAN IN ALLEGED MAIL FRAUD SCAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A federal grand jury indictment unsealed Monday charges an Irvine man with 15 
counts of mail fraud stemming from an investment scheme, according to the U.S. 
attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
 Allan H. Mawhinney, 64, is accused of bilking more than a dozen friends and 
business associates of $765,000 by falsely promising to invest their money with 
Fidelity Investments, a mutual fund company, Assistant U.S. Atty.Deirdre Z. 
Eliot said. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Mawhinney used some of the money to finance a lavish lifestyle and 
put some into his own mutual fund accounts, officials said. He drew up phony 
account data that he used to fool the investors into believing their money was 
safe, Eliot said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mawhinney, who could not be reached for comment, faces up to 75 years in 
prison and a $250,000 fine if convicted of all charges, Eliot said. Mawhinney 
was arrested over the weekend and a federal court arraignment will probably be 
held in the next week, the federal prosecutor said. It was not immediately 
known if Mawhinney had retained counsel, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "According to the indictment, he basically won the confidence of personal 
friends and business associates and the pitch was always the same," Eliot said, 
adding that investors were promised a high rate of return. 
</P>
<P>
 The scheme unraveled when an investor called the company and learned that the 
investment firm had no record of her account, Eliot said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The statements looked quite real," Eliot said, adding that the scheme dated 
back to 1989. "It took them a while to really believe what was going on." 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Postal Inspection Service in Santa Ana investigated the case, Eliot 
said.

UCI MEDICAL CENTER UNIT GETS GRANT FOR CANCER PROGRAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 UCI Medical Center's division of gynecologic oncology recently was awarded an 
$850,000 grant to continue its four-year teaching and research training 
program, hospital officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The program is the only one in the country. 
</P>
<P>
 The grant, given by the National Cancer Institute/National Institutes of 
Health, is aimed at training doctors to do research and manage obstetric and 
gynecologic research departments at university medical centers throughout the 
nation. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a scarcity of these kinds of doctors who specialize in ob-gyn who are 
able to do and manage research departments," hospital spokeswoman Fran Tardiff 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tardiff said physicians in the program will spend two years learning basic lab 
research and the next two years using what they have learned to help patients. 
</P>
<P>
 Students will do research on cancer, immunology, biochemistry, molecular 
biology and other medical areas, Tardiff said. 
</P>
<P>
 There are currently six doctors in the program doing research on cancer of the

MAN SENTENCED IN LOAN FRAUD CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A 50-year-old Newport Beach man was sentenced Monday to two years in federal 
prison and fined more than $1 million for submitting false loan applications to 
finance property deals in south Orange County, according to the U.S. attorney's 
office. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Douglas Herbst filed the applications on behalf of investors and 
inflated their incomes to help ensure the loans would be issued, Assistant U.S. 
Atty.Stanley L. Friedman said. Herbst took out loans totaling more than $4 
million from Glendale Federal Bank, the prosecutor said. 
</P>
<P>
 Herbst pleaded guilty May 13 to 10 counts of submitting false loan 
applications stemming from real estate deals dating back to July, 1989, and 
involving prime real estate property in Newport Beach, Friedman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Income data is usually scrutinized by the bank's staff but the deception was 
not discovered until after the bank lost more than $1 million, Friedman said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He would solicit investors to buy properties in Newport Beach and they would 
sign a blank loan application," Friedman said.

POLICE CHECK CASE OF MAN SHOT IN NECK AT A FRIEND'S HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Santa Ana man was shot and wounded late Sunday night at a Newport Beach home 
of an acquaintance, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Timothy Becker, 31, was listed in stable condition at UCI Medical Center in 
Orange on Monday after being shot in the neck, said Sgt. Andy Gonis.Becker and 
the woman who lived there, 47-year-old Charlene Dryer, knew each other and 
might have once been romantically involved, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police believe 28-year-old Mark Sobolewski of San Clemente shot Becker, but no 
arrests were made while investigators sorted out circumstances of the incident, 
which took place just before midnight, Gonis said. Sobolewski's relationship to 
Dryer was still unclear, he said.  
</P>
<P>
 Police believe Becker was shot after he showed up at Dryer's house, and 
Sobolewski was there. 
</P>
<P>
 Police answered a report of a burglary and shots fired at the home in the 1800 
block of Irvine Avenue, Gonis said. They arrived to find Becker wounded, he 
said.

MURDER TRIAL OF SIMPSON BEGINS; COURTS: MORE THAN HALF OF THE FIRST 200 JURY 
CANDIDATES ARE DISMISSED BECAUSE OF HARDSHIP OF SERVING. PROSECUTION WANTS 
FINAL SELECTION MADE AFTER DNA HEARINGS END. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 More than 200 prospective jurors in the O.J. Simpson case reported for duty 
Monday, slipping into a courthouse awash in demonstrators and news media and 
officially kicking off one of the most celebrated murder trials in American 
history. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday's session marked the first time that prospective jurors were questioned 
about their availability to be part of a trial that could last six months. The 
jurors who are selected could be forced to cut off ties with friends, family 
and jobs if the judge agrees to sequester the panel, as prosecutors have asked. 
</P>
<P>
 Anticipating that many people will not be able to endure such a hardship, 
Superior Court Judge Lance A. Ito had 1,000 prospective jurors contacted and 
questioned about their availability. The first batch of 219 people reported to 
the Downtown criminal courthouse Monday, making their way into the building 
unnoticed despite hundreds of reporters and a smaller collection of protesters 
who gathered beneath overcast skies on a muggy afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 As he began the process of questioning 63 prospective jurors whose answers to 
questions about possible hardships had been ambiguous, Ito retired with the 
lawyers, three news reporters and court staff into a small room adjoining the 
jury assembly area. There, the first number he drew was for potential juror 
number 0032. For most of his storied football career, Simpson wore the number 
32. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know if this is an omen," said Ito as Simpson nodded his head slowly 
in agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 Even before the first prospective jurors set foot inside the building, many 
had made it clear that they would have grave difficulties participating. In 
response to written questions, 90 said they would suffer serious personal 
hardships if required to sit on the panel. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of those said their employers would not pay for long jury service. Others 
said they had personal responsibilities that would make it impossible to be 
away from home for so long. 
</P>
<P>
 Once Monday's batch of possible jurors had assembled, Ito informed them of the 
job ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never seen a case as unusual as this case," he told the prospective 
jurors who gathered in the Criminal Court Building's cavernous assembly room. 
"This is probably the most important decision you will make in your personal 
life. It is the most important decision of any American citizen. I need a fair 
jury." 
</P>
<P>
 Within minutes of their arrival, more than 80 panelists who said they had 
serious personal hardships were excused. 
</P>
<P>
 Later during the one-on-one questioning, a woman broke into tears, giving 
several reasons she could not serve. She was excused. A man who seemed so 
overcome with emotion that he had difficulty speaking told Ito: "I have 
nightmares." He too was excused. 
</P>
<P>
 Also questioned was a man who only half-jokingly said the thought of being 
sequestered until February, 1995, put him in mind of the snake pit in the movie 
"Indiana Jones." 
</P>
<P>
 "Could you still serve?" the judge asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, but I still worry about the snakes," the man answered. 
</P>
<P>
 Ito would not excuse him. 
</P>
<P>
 The original batch of 219 prospective panelists was a racially diverse group 
that included people of all ages. Those who indicated they had no problems that 
would prevent them from spending as much as six months on the trial appeared 
older than those who were dismissed early on. 
</P>
<P>
 The 100 prospective jurors who were left Monday after the excusals will be 
questioned later about their exposure to coverage of the case and about any 
predispositions that might make it difficult for them to be impartial. 
</P>
<P>
 As the jury screening got under way, Simpson appeared confident and relaxed. 
Dressed in a blue suit and flanked by attorneys Johnnie L. Cochran Jr. and 
Robert L. Shapiro, along with other members of his high-powered legal defense 
team, Simpson stood before the prospective jurors. It was the first time he 
faced some of the people who may decide if he spends the rest of his life in 
prison or returns home to care for his two young children left motherless by 
the murder of Simpson's ex-wife. 
</P>
<P>
 Addressing the prospective jurors, Simpson said simply: "Good afternoon." He 
then sat down and folded his hands in his lap. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, in the smaller room, as he waited for the questioning to begin, Simpson 
hummed a tune and sang softly to himself the words "A new day has begun." 
</P>
<P>
 Since his arrest after a nationally televised low-speed chase June 17, Simpson 
has steadfastly denied any role in the killings of Nicole Brown Simpson and 
Ronald Lyle Goldman, proclaiming at his Superior Court arraignment that he is 
"absolutely, 100% not guilty." 
</P>
<P>
 The bodies of the two victims were discovered June 13, shortly after midnight, 
and the grisly find triggered an intense criminal investigation that has 
riveted the nation's attention ever since. 
</P>
<P>
 Given the enormous crush of publicity surrounding the case, both sides believe 
it will be impossible to find jurors who have not heard about it. But the judge 
and lawyers are looking for 12 panelists and eight alternates who can put aside 
what they have heard and rely solely on the evidence presented in court to come 
to a verdict. 
</P>
<P>
 To help them in that task, the judge and lawyers have collaborated on a 
75-page questionnaire probing jurors about their exposure to the case and their 
feelings about topics related to it. All of the jurors who were called Monday 
and who were not excused began filling out the questionnaires. 
</P>
<P>
 When Ito told the group how voluminous the questionnaire is, they groaned 
audibly. He warned them that the completed forms will be given to journalists. 
Before that happens, names and identifying information about the prospective 
jurors will be deleted. 
</P>
<P>
 First, however, Ito must identify people who can afford to serve. That means 
finding people who can effectively give up six months of their lives to serve 
as jurors -- a job that pays $5 per day plus 10 cents a mile, one way, to the 
courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday morning, prosecutors and defense attorneys reviewed the answers 
supplied by the first 219 prospective panelists to the pretrial questions, 
agreeing to excuse many of them immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 In one case, the prospective juror was a physically disabled retiree. "It 
seems to me this would be an act of futility to ask this person to stay," Ito 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other prospective jurors said they would have difficulty serving because their 
employers only pay them for limited jury service. One possible juror wrote that 
his or her employer would only cover 30 days. 
</P>
<P>
 "I anticipate we will use (that) up in short order," Ito said, but he and the 
lawyers agreed to question that person further to see whether the loss of 
income would pose too great a hardship. 
</P>
<P>
 By day's end, 112 people from the initial batch of prospective jurors had been 
dismissed. The process is scheduled to resume this afternoon, and Ito expressed 
his satisfaction that it was going well so far. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the complexity of picking a jury in the Simpson case is compounded by 
what is expected to be a prolonged hearing on the admissibility of DNA evidence 
in the case. Prosecutors are expected to seek to use DNA test results 
suggesting that blood from the scene of the crime came from Simpson. 
Preliminary DNA tests of a glove found outside Simpson's house also have 
indicated that the glove, which matches one found at the murder scene, 
contained the blood of both victims and possibly Simpson as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Also being scrutinized are blood stains from Simpson's Ford Bronco and 
driveway and a pair of socks found in his bedroom. Although local television 
station KNBC has reported that DNA tests showed that blood on at least one of 
those socks matched Nicole Simpson's, other sources have told The Times that 
only conventional blood tests have been run so far on those socks. While 
conventional blood testing can limit the number of possible sources of blood, 
it is not nearly as discriminating as the most precise DNA tests. 
</P>
<P>
 The DNA arguments are expected to mount in coming weeks, and they complicate 
jury selection because both sides expect to spend as much as a month debating 
the issue in court -- an argument that Ito must keep jurors from hearing 
despite the intense media attention that it is sure to draw. 
</P>
<P>
 While the DNA hearing is under way, jurors cannot be present since the purpose 
of the hearing is to determine what should be admitted into evidence and what 
should not, and jurors may not base their verdicts on anything but evidence in 
the case. Because of that, prosecutors are concerned about any plan that would 
allow jurors to be picked and then permitted to return home for up to one month 
while the two sides dispute DNA evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 "These jurors, who will know with certainty that they will be charged with the 
responsibility of deciding this case, will be far more intensely curious about 
the evidence than they had previously been prior to their selection as jurors," 
prosecutors said in a motion filed last week and unsealed Monday. "Upon the 
jury's return to court, after the lengthy hiatus, they will have to be 
individually (questioned) again to determine to what degree their exposure to 
pretrial publicity has rendered them unfit to remain as jurors. That some of 
those jurors will be deemed unfit, under the unprecedented circumstances of 
this case, is almost a foregone conclusion." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, prosecutors proposed that Judge Ito conduct just the first phase of 
jury selection now, eliminating any prospective juror who could not serve 
because of the length of the case but deferring the individual questioning 
needed to select the final panel. They recommended that once the so-called 
hardship questioning is concluded, all the remaining prospective panelists 
could return home, only to be recalled once the DNA hearings have been 
concluded, possibly in November. 
</P>
<P>
 At that point, the judge and lawyers would resume jury selection by 
questioning the remaining panelists individually to weed out those with biases, 
prosecutors recommended. Ito called that an "unusual motion" and said he would 
consider it Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 As the trial got under way, the frenzy surrounding the case rose to a 
crescendo Downtown: Monday morning, 56 television cameras jostled for position 
with an array of protesters on the sidewalks in front of the Criminal Courts 
Building. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the demonstrators wore buttons and T-shirts that proclaimed Simpson's 
innocence, others represented a grab-bag of religious and political causes. One 
man sold buttons with the logo: "O.J. Juror Reject. Didn't Make the Cut." 
</P>
<P>
 Inside, meanwhile, a lawyer for The Times filed a last-minute motion seeking 
greater access to the jury selection process. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney Kelli L. Sager met with Ito Monday morning, and the judge then agreed 
to expand the pool of reporters who would cover the process that day. Three 
designated pool reporters -- Linda Deutsch of the Associated Press, Andrea Ford 
from The Times and Greg LaMotte of CNN -- were allowed to observe Monday's 
questioning of prospective jurors. 
</P>
<P>
 Those spots will be rotated to other correspondents as the process continues. 
When it comes time to individually question prospective jurors, Ito will move 
the sessions to his courtroom, where an audio transmission will allow hundreds 
of other reporters ensconced at the courthouse to listen in. 
</P>
<P>
 He still has not ruled on whether to end television coverage of the trial or 
to expel KNBC reporters from the courthouse -- two moves he is contemplating 
because of the KNBC reports last week regarding the alleged DNA tests of 
Simpson's socks. 
</P>
<P>
 Ito said last week that he wanted to hold a hearing on those ideas this week. 
He has set aside Wednesday morning to hear some remaining arguments about 
evidence in the case, but has not yet said when he plans to hold the session 
regarding the television coverage of the case.

INFERIOR TUNNEL BRACES CITED IN GROUND SINKAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID WILLMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The use of inferior materials for the bracing of subway tunnels contributed to 
surface sinkage last month along Hollywood Boulevard, transit officials 
confirmed Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago, project engineers had allowed the tunnel builder to use wood 
wedges for bracing, instead of steel struts. But the wood was crushed last 
month during the ground sinkages, and samples of the wood have failed strength 
tests. 
</P>
<P>
 Franklin E. White, chief executive officer of the Metropolitan Transportation 
Authority, announced Monday that he would retain "an outside construction 
specialist" by the end of the week to investigate how and on what basis the 
materials were used. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would say to you that this has shaken terribly my confidence in the 
construction firm and the firms supervising the construction for us," White 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives of the construction firm, Shea-Kiewit-Kenny, were unavailable 
for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 The MTA relies on the Pasadena-based firm of Parsons-Dillingham to inspect the 
construction. Decisions regarding which materials are permissible for the 
subway construction generally are left to a group of private engineering firms, 
led by the company of Parsons Brinckerhoff of New York. 
</P>
<P>
 In Pasadena, a spokesman for Parsons-Dillingham said the management firm 
"looks forward to an independent investigation of the situation by a qualified, 
outside organization." 
</P>
<P>
 Last October, White hired two groups of specialists to review the construction 
of Downtown subway tunnels now open to passengers. Those experts concluded that 
areas of the tunnels were built with concrete thinner than specified and needed 
repairs, and that Parsons-Dillingham had fallen short of "acceptable industry 
practice" in supervising the work. 
</P>
<P>
 White said Monday that he first learned of the potential problem with the 
bracing of the Hollywood tunnels one week ago after inquiries by The Times. 
</P>
<P>
 Records show that in September, 1992, transit engineers allowed the tunnel 
builder to use 32-inch-long wood wedges for bracing in expansion gaps between 
segments of a precast concrete shell that forms the tunnel's outer liner. 
Originally the contract required use of metal struts in the gaps. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though project officials authorized the substitution of the wood wedges, 
records show that the specifications still required Shea-Kiewit-Kenny to place 
concrete or a non-shrink grout material into the gaps. The contract required 
that the concrete or grout be placed no later than 16 hours after insertion of 
the tapered four-inch-wide wedges. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, hours after The Times asked whether the concrete or grout had been 
properly placed, MTA chief White announced that he was launching an 
investigation of the entire matter. 
</P>
<P>
 "Preliminary test results on some sample (wood) wedges have indicated that the 
wood actually used failed to meet its specified strength and that accompanying 
concrete in the gap may not have been properly placed or met design 
specifications," said an MTA press release. 
</P>
<P>
 Shea-Kiewit-Kenny won approval to substitute the wood for metal struts on the 
basis that the new material would have a compressive strength of 1,556 pounds 
per square inch, according to contract documents. The new material was supposed 
to be oak or "equivalent hardwood." But experts said that specification exceeds 
the strength of oak. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are investigating whether we got the wood that was approved for use, and 
that it was as strong as it was supposed to be," White said. "We also will 
review the decision to substitute the wooden wedges and the supervision of the 
installation of them." 
</P>
<P>
 An MTA "Tunnel Review Board" report prepared by the project's chief tunnel 
designer and distributed Sept. 1 cited the crushing of the wood wedges as part 
of the "immediate cause" of the ground sinkages along Hollywood Boulevard. 
Those sinkages, ranging from one to nine inches, have damaged utilities and 
buildings. Tunneling has been halted since Aug. 18. 
</P>
<P>
 The crushing of the wedges and weakening of eight-inch-thick segments of 
concrete caused a Shea-Kiewit-Kenny superintendent Aug. 20 to evacuate one of 
the twin tunnels out of fear that it was collapsing. 
</P>
<P>
 Records show that the chief tunnel designer, Timothy P. Smirnoff of Parsons 
Brinckerhoff, was one of two project officials who approved the use of wood 
wedges. Smirnoff, reached Monday night, declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times reported Sept. 11 that roughly 340 linear feet of tunnel was 
constructed in the area of sinkages without another procedure, "contact" 
grouting, required by the contract. 
</P>
<P>
 The article also reported that top MTA officials did not require 
Shea-Kiewit-Kenny to comply with the grouting requirement until last March, 
after more than one-third of the structures had already been excavated. 
</P>
<P>
 Edward McSpedon, the president of rail construction for the MTA, has told MTA 
board members that ground sinkages of one to two inches are to be expected in 
subway construction. But a 1992 report prepared for McSpedon's staff by 
Degenkolb Structural Engineers stated that "the settlement is expected to range 
from 1/16 (inch) to 1/4 (inch) along Hollywood Boulevard."

L.A. MARATHON FIRM FINED FOR CONCEALING DONATIONS; ETHICS: ORGANIZATION ADMITS 
LAUNDERING CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS WHILE CITY CONTRACT WAS UP FOR RENEWAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 The organization that runs the Los Angeles Marathon and one of its former top 
employees have admitted laundering $73,000 in campaign contributions to local 
and state elected officials and agreed to pay a $436,000 fine to settle a 
lengthy investigation, according to documents released Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Marathon President William Burke was not personally cited for money 
laundering, but he admitted in the legal settlement with city and state 
officials that his organization concealed the fact that it was the true source 
of donations to 14 candidates, most of them in the city of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the illegal donations were made at about the time that marathon 
officials were coming before the Los Angeles City Council to request an 
extension of their contract to operate the popular race that they took over in 
1985. The council approved the new contract, which expires at the end of 2000. 
</P>
<P>
 Burke, a local political fixture who is the husband of Los Angeles County 
Supervisor Yvonne Brathwaite Burke, acknowledged to the city Ethics Commission 
and the state Fair Political Practices Commission that he personally signed or 
authorized that checks be written to an associate, George Beasley. Beasley 
illegally reimbursed dozens of individuals for making campaign contributions. 
</P>
<P>
 In legal stipulations with the two government watchdog agencies, only Beasley 
admitted improperly reimbursing others for political donations. Nothing in the 
documents indicated that Burke knew how the money was used. 
</P>
<P>
 Burke declined to comment Monday. But in an October, 1992, interview, near the 
beginning of the investigation, he said he knew nothing about donations from 
Los Angeles Marathon Inc. being funneled to candidates through others. He said 
he had placed political fund-raising affairs in Beasley's hands. "Quite 
frankly, if I'm guilty of anything . . . I probably did not provide him with 
the kind of guidance and support I should have," Burke said. 
</P>
<P>
 Beasley also did not return telephone calls, and his lawyer declined comment. 
</P>
<P>
 The tentative settlements in the case, released simultaneously in Los Angeles 
and Sacramento, do not become final unless they are approved next month in 
hearings before the city Ethics Commission and the state Fair Political 
Practices Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 If approved, the agreements will constitute the most recent victory in a joint 
investigation by the two agencies into individuals and firms that tried to 
conceal that they were the true source of massive campaign contributions. The 
donations were typically funneled through other individuals or companies to 
disguise their source. 
</P>
<P>
 The FPPC and the Ethics Commission last year secured an $895,000 fine from the 
Evergreen America Corp., a giant shipping firm that admitted it had concealed 
the source of $172,000 in contributions to state and local officials. The fine 
was the largest of its kind in a money-laundering probe in California. 
</P>
<P>
 In the settlement agreed to earlier this month, the marathon organization 
admitted that it was the true source of 137 campaign contributions that were 
given under other names from 1989 through the spring of 1992. The donations 
went mostly to candidates for Los Angeles City Council in 1991 and 1992, 
although former Mayor Tom Bradley, who received $4,500, was a major 
beneficiary. 
</P>
<P>
 The largest amount went to Oakland Mayor Elihu Harris, who received 40 
contributions totaling $21,000 in 1989 and 1990. State Controller Gray Davis 
received one laundered marathon contribution of $1,000. Eight Los Angeles City 
Council members were also among those receiving funds, with Nate Holden 
receiving $9,000, the largest amount. Several unsuccessful council candidates 
also received funds. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokeswoman for the Oakland mayor said Harris "has no knowledge of this at 
all and all calls should go to the FPPC." It was unclear from the settlement 
papers what connection, if any, Harris might have to the marathon or its 
organizers. 
</P>
<P>
 Holden was out of his office Monday and could not be reached for comment. 
Davis also could not be reached.

<P>
 In the past, candidates have said it is difficult for them to know the true 
source of all campaign contributions or whether those listed as donors have 
been reimbursed by others. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ethics Commission, however, has held seminars in which it urged candidates 
to aggressively ferret out the true source of campaign donations. The agency in 
the past has ordered officials to return laundered donations, even if they 
received them unwittingly, if there is money in their campaign accounts. 
</P>
<P>
 The stipulations released Monday described a pattern for most of the illicit 
donations. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Marathon Inc. representatives Burke, Beasley and Marie Patrick, 
described as an officer in the company, would sign checks from the marathon 
over to Beasley, once a top employee at the marathon and later a principal in a 
firm bearing his name. Marathon employees, their relatives and others would 
then give donations to political officials and then be reimbursed by Beasley or 
his firm, according to settlement papers. 
</P>
<P>
 The funneling of contributions in this way "undermines the public's right to 
know legally required information about the source of political support and 
contributions and circumvents campaign contribution limits established by the 
Los Angeles City Charter," ethics officials concluded. 
</P>
<P>
 City Council candidates are permitted to receive $500 donations from each 
individual or entity per election, while mayoral candidates can receive $1,000. 
The laundering operation permitted the marathon to pour thousands of dollars 
more into the campaign accounts of council members and others. 
</P>
<P>
 The scheme also allowed the marathon to exceed the amount that an individual 
or organization can give in a single election. In 1991, the marathon donated 
$29,500 more than the legal limit in that year's primary and runoff elections. 
</P>
<P>
 The repeated nature of the activity "displays intentional laundering activity, 
rather than an isolated incident," according to the settlement signed by Burke, 
Beasley and their lawyers. They also conceded that the violations took place at 
a time when the marathon "had matters pending for decision" before the City 
Council. 
</P>
<P>
 The illicit contributions to Los Angeles officeholders and candidates were 
made from February, 1991, through April, 1992. The City Council approved a 
contract with marathon officials in the spring of 1991 that extended the 
marathon's run through 2000. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the council extended the contract, City Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky and 
others had questioned whether the city was getting the best deal from the 
marathon. The city controller's office had found that some payments from the 
race organization were late and that books were kept so sloppily that it was 
difficult to track whether the city was receiving its fair share of receipts. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's routine audits of the marathon were eliminated by the City Council 
during a contract amendment in 1989, although financial reviews are still 
permitted under some circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
 No audit has been completed in the 1990s, said Tim Lynch, a deputy city 
controller. 
</P>
<P>
 While some city officials have questioned whether the city has gotten a fair 
shake from Los Marathon Inc., Burke is widely credited with turning the 
marathon from an obscure road race into an internationally known event that 
attracted 19,000 runners last March and has corporate liaisons with such 
companies as Mercedes-Benz. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Ethics Commission begun its investigation of the marathon in 
the summer of 1992 and soon was joined by the state FPPC. 
</P>
<P>
 Both city and state officials declined to elaborate at all on the twin 
settlements released by their offices. The agreement was reached as the two 
agencies were enmeshed in a feud that boiled over last week. 
</P>
<P>
 An FPPC official accused Ethics Commission Director Ben Bycel of, among other 
lapses, trying to intimidate lawyers in cases under investigation and of 
leaking information to the press. The letter from FPPC Director Wayne Ordos 
also said his agency had done the lion's share of the work in the 
money-laundering investigations. 
</P>
<P>
 Bycel responded that his agency had gotten the cases started and carried more 
than half the load from there. 
</P>
<P>
 The feud led Ordos to order that his agency no long work with city officials. 
But officials in both Sacramento and Los Angeles said their work to root out 
illegal contributions will continue, even if they have to work separately. 
Campaign Contributions 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Marathon Inc. has admitted improperly concealing the source of 
campaign contributions to candidates. The private firm enlisted employees, 
associates and relatives to make contributions to favored candidates and 
reimbursed the contributors. The recipients may not have known the true source 
of the funds. LAMI gave $73,000 to the following candidates from 1989 to April, 
1992: ELECTED CITY OFFICIALS: AMOUNT * Councilman Nate Holden: $9,000 * 
Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas: $5,500 * Mayor Tom Bradley: $4,500 * 
Councilwoman Ruth Galanter: $4,500 * Councilman Richard Alatorre: $4,000 * 
Councilman Hal Bernson: $3,500 * Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky: $2,500 * 
Councilman Joel Wachs: $2,000 * Councilwoman Rita Walters: $1,500 COUNCIL 
CANDIDATES: AMOUNT * Sharon Mee Yung Lowe: $6,500 * Bob Gay: $5,000 * Brad Pye 
Jr.: $2,500 OTHER: AMOUNT * Candidates for Non-City Races: $22,000 TOTAL: 
$51,000

MARINE WHO FIRED FIRST SAW AMBUSH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD A. SERRANO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 His name is Virge. He is 24 and married and will be a father any day now. He 
loves football and he loves the Marines, and he has a wide smile and eyes as 
blue-green as the Caribbean. 
</P>
<P>
 He is also the Marine who fired first -- and gave the order for his men to 
fire too -- on a group of Haitian police officers Saturday night in the only 
violent encounter involving U.S. troops since the military landed a week ago. 
The clash left 10 Haitian policemen dead. 
</P>
<P>
 The actions of Lt. Virgil Palumbo, attached to Echo Company, 2nd Battalion of 
the 2nd Marine Regiment, in front of the crowded police headquarters in Haiti's 
second-largest city heightened the debate over the proper role of U.S. troops 
here. 
</P>
<P>
 Palumbo and his men, in a series of interviews here Monday, insisted that they 
were being set up for an ambush by the Haitian police Saturday night. And they 
believe they did what was right to protect themselves and a crowd of bystanders 
-- and, indeed, the honor of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is going to sound corny and all, but you know what?" Palumbo said. "I 
love my country." 
</P>
<P>
 At this northern city's seaport and airfield Monday, other Marines were 
preparing to go home. By today, most of the 1,600 Marines here are expected to 
be gone, replaced by 3,000 fresh soldiers from the Army's 10th Mountain Light 
Infantry Division in Ft. Drum, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
 But Palumbo was leading his men on a one-mile patrol through the city, one of 
his last. In doorways and alleys, as they have done all week, the people of Cap 
Haitien watched them as they paraded past. 
</P>
<P>
 Palumbo had never seen such poverty as Haiti's, although he grew up in the 
smallest of coal-mining towns in western Pennsylvania. He is the son of the 
high school principal in Windber, and now he was walking past children, 
teen-agers and young adults whose parents could never afford to send them to 
school. 
</P>
<P>
 "You look in their eyes and you could see a lot of hope," he said, waving to 
some of those lining his patrol route. "People want to help themselves out of 
their misery. I can't say enough about these people. Just great people." 
</P>
<P>
 Many people in the last few days, including several eyewitnesses, have 
contradicted the Marines' version of what happened outside police headquarters 
here Saturday night. Some claim the Haitian police fired first when they felt 
threatened by the presence of the Marines. Others said the Marines were lying 
in wait, or had come to the police building spoiling for a fight. 
</P>
<P>
 Some relatives of the dead policemen even say they were told by others who 
escaped that a Marine translator told the crowd to lie on the ground and then 
the troops started shooting at the police, who were inside the station. 
</P>
<P>
 Still others believe that even though the police are hated here, the dispute 
could have been settled without gunfire. 
</P>
<P>
 But Palumbo and his squad of 14 men tell it differently. They had been 
standing guard in front of the police headquarters for two hours when, in the 
last light of dusk, Palumbo said, he saw trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 Two Haitian policemen came out of the front gate, and it looked as though they 
were pretending to be arguing. One pulled out a pistol and the other an Uzi 
submachine gun. Palumbo, who was just five yards away from them, said they 
suddenly turned toward him. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he raised his M-16 and shot them both in a series of loud bursts. "I 
just reacted," he said. "We were threatened. My men were threatened. Without a 
doubt, I can prove we were set up in an ambush and that they knew exactly what 
they were doing." 
</P>
<P>
 He ordered his men to fire, he said, just as he saw two Haitian police 
attaches, or armed auxiliaries, in the crowd pulling guns too and opening fire 
at his unit. Above him, a Haitian police officer leaned out a window and fired 
on the Marines below, Palumbo said. 
</P>
<P>
 On the ground, the Marines had no cover. Some split to the left, others to the 
right. Palumbo held the middle position -- what he called the "kill zone." He 
and his men all fired, from their hips or their shoulders or on bended knee. 
</P>
<P>
 Only one American -- Jose Joseph, a Navy translator -- was injured. And even 
as he was being treated by Navy Medic Andres Espinosa for a wound to the left 
leg, he continued to translate commands to the crowd into Creole. 
</P>
<P>
 Palumbo insisted that his men stand their ground -- exposed -- and not seek 
cover. He feared that if they moved they might bring some of the bystanders 
into the line of fire. 
</P>
<P>
 And the fighting was fierce. Machine gunner Lance Cpl. David Grogan fired 150 
rounds in 15 seconds. Seaman Peter (Doc) Flynn heard bullets plinking to his 
right and to his left, and another shot that whizzed just overhead. 
</P>
<P>
 Travis Moldenhauer fired one magazine of 30 rounds, then dropped to one knee 
and emptied a second magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 Staff Sgt. Todd Arnold said simply, "Every 15 seconds seemed like an 
eternity." 
</P>
<P>
 Palumbo called the cease-fire. In the darkness before him, he thought he saw a 
dead Marine lying on the street. On hands and knees, he crawled toward the 
figure. 
</P>
<P>
 "But when I got up there," he said, "it wasn't a Marine at all. It was a bush. 
And you can believe I was relieved." 
</P>
<P>
 Around the Marine encampment for the next few days, there was talk among the 
men of bravado and great heroics and medals for valor. But Palumbo was thinking 
about what his wife was going to say about his being in that life-or-death 
situation. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's going to chew me out when I get home," he said, cracking another wide 
smile. "And when my wife gets done beating up on me, boy, then they can give me 
a Purple Heart." 
</P>
<P>
 Palumbo is married to Bernie, his sweetheart from high school, where he was a 
football player, as he was later at the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis, Md. In 
a week or two, the couple expect the birth of their first child. 
</P>
<P>
 "We already know it's going to be a girl, and we named her Dana," Palumbo 
said. "I found out the day I left home in late July. I really wanted to know 
that. That way, if anything happened, at least I would have known." Showdown in 
Haiti 
</P>
<P>
 The Marines involved in Saturday's gunfight say they were being set up for an 
ambush by the Haitian police. Here's their version of the events: 
</P>
<P>
 1) At 5 p.m., 14 U.S. Marines show up at police station to begin two-hours of 
guard duty. 
</P>
<P>
 2) Between 5 and 7 p.m., a crowd of Haitians forms across 20th Street. 
</P>
<P>
 3) At 7 p.m., two Haitian policemen step out the front door and begin to 
argue. They pull guns and turn toward Lt. Virge Palumbo. He kills them both. 
With no cover, Marines split right and left and begin to fire on other 
policemen in the building. 
</P>
<P>
 4) Two Haitian police attaches in the crowd pull guns and open fire on the 
unit. 
</P>
<P>
 5) The gun battle leaves 10 Haitians dead and at least five wounded.

CLINTON EASES U.S. SANCTIONS AGAINST HAITI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NORMAN KEMPSTER and STANLEY MEISLER, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton, asserting that the American military intervention will soon 
end human rights abuses in Haiti, softened U.S. economic sanctions against the 
impoverished Caribbean nation Monday to permit a resumption of airline service, 
financial transactions and humanitarian projects. 
</P>
<P>
 In a speech to the General Assembly, Clinton said it is time to begin 
rebuilding Haiti's shattered economy because elected President Jean-Bertrand 
Aristide, ousted in a military coup three years ago, is scheduled to regain 
power in less than three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Essential civil order will be restored," Clinton said. "Human rights 
violations will be curbed. . . . The military leaders will step down, the 
democratic government will be restored. President Aristide will return." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton said he has already lifted U.S. sanctions except those aimed directly 
at military leaders and their civilian supporters, and he urged other countries 
to do the same. He said the embargo imposed by the Security Council should be 
ended after Aristide's return to Haiti, scheduled for soon after Oct. 15. Food, 
medicine and other humanitarian goods should begin flowing immediately, he 
added. 
</P>
<P>
 Relaxation of the sanctions was part of a U.S. charm offensive intended to 
show most Haitians that the projected 15,000-strong U.S. military presence is 
friendly. In other steps, the U.S. forces began distributing food and medicine 
and launched a project to restore electric service throughout the country. The 
U.S. military also announced plans to protect the Haitian Parliament and to 
transport exiled lawmakers back to Port-au-Prince for a key meeting Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, Defense Secretary William J. Perry said the Pentagon will 
make no changes in the rules that permit U.S. troops to use deadly force to 
protect themselves or to prevent human rights abuses by the Haitian 
authorities, despite a weekend shooting in Cap Haitien that left 10 Haitian 
policemen dead. 
</P>
<P>
 In his U.N. speech, Clinton said that Aristide proposed an end to sanctions 
Sunday "in the spirit of reconciliation and reconstruction." Aristide had 
strongly supported the economic embargo earlier as a way to put pressure on the 
Haitian military command, which overthrew him Sept. 30, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 "I intend to act expeditiously . . . to restore health care, water and 
electrical services; construction materials for humanitarian efforts, and 
communications, agricultural and educational materials," Clinton said. All of 
those shipments are theoretically permitted under a humanitarian exception to 
the embargo voted by the Security Council in May, but in reality the overall 
embargo has been so tight that few of these supplies have reached Haiti. The 
U.N. ban on petroleum products and weapons will remain in effect until Aristide 
is back in power. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton also lifted unilateral U.S. restrictions on commercial airline 
flights, financial transactions and travel. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the U.S. intervention in Haiti was endorsed by the Security Council, 
the General Assembly delegates did not applaud any part of the Haiti section of 
the President's speech. The U.S. military action drew rebukes from Brazil and 
Mexico. Both Latin American countries have long opposed what they regard as 
U.S. adventurism in the Western Hemisphere. 
</P>
<P>
 Addressing the 184 members of the United Nations just before Clinton's speech, 
Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim implied that the U.S. intervention had 
broken the spirit of the charters of both the United Nations and the 
Organization of American States, which prohibit interference in the internal 
affairs of member states. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was disturbing that the principles of nonintervention and 
self-determination were the object of interpretations that are incompatible 
with the charters," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking just after Clinton, Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari said 
his country is committed to re-establishing democratic order in Haiti. But he 
added pointedly that it also believes in "the need to give preference to 
peaceful and diplomatic means above all others." 
</P>
<P>
 In Washington, the Pentagon said it is ready to provide a military aircraft to 
take 21 members of the Haitian Parliament back to Port-au-Prince for 
Wednesday's debate over amnesty for Lt. Gen. Raoul Cedras and other junta 
leaders. Aristide, under pressure from the U.S. Congress, called the special 
session to consider a blanket pardon, which could permit Cedras and his top 
aides to remain in Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 The bicameral Parliament consists of a 27-member Senate and an 83-member 
Chamber of Deputies. About 40 lawmakers are in exile, including the 21 who have 
asked for U.S. military transportation. Officials said that if other exiles ask 
for transportation, they will also get it. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, U.S. troops will protect the Parliament and its members during 
the session. The lawmakers have not met for months because so many members are 
in exile or in hiding that it has been unable to muster a quorum. 
</P>
<P>
 At a Washington press conference, Perry said the U.S. forces will do 
everything possible to demonstrate to the Haitians that the occupation is 
friendly. At the same time, he said, the troops must make sure that the 
military government abides by its promise to step down by Oct. 15. 
</P>
<P>
 "They (the troops) are there as friends and not invaders, and that's 
manifested by the delivery of food and medicine," Perry said.

THE TIMES POLL; JURY SYSTEM IS HELD IN LOW REGARD BY MOST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAURA DOLAN, TIMES LEGAL AFFAIRS WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As jury selection gets under way in the murder trial of O. J. Simpson, a 
majority of Los Angeles County residents express little faith in the jury 
system and believe they have no civic obligation to serve, according to a Times 
poll. 
</P>
<P>
 The poll found that 55% of county residents surveyed last week have "only some 
or very little" confidence in the ability of juries to decide criminal cases. 
The respondents volunteered that the system's major flaws are incompetent and 
unknowledgeable jurors who fail to set aside prejudices and preconceived 
notions. 
</P>
<P>
 Doubts about the jury system crossed racial lines, although African Americans 
expressed the least confidence in it. Respondents were almost evenly divided 
over whether jurors decide verdicts on the evidence (40%) or according to their 
predispositions (44%). 
</P>
<P>
 "That is a lot of doubt," said Times Poll Director John Brennan. 
</P>
<P>
 The survey also contained bad news for jury critics who believe the system 
would improve if more people took the time to serve. A sizable 57% of the 
respondents said they regard jury duty as a "personal choice" that each citizen 
should make individually, compared to 41% who viewed it as a civic 
responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
 Just over half said they would be inclined to serve on a criminal jury if 
called, but 43% said they would avoid jury duty. Those who would resist serving 
cited such impediments as financial reasons, ill health, lack of time or family 
obligations. A reluctance to judge other people was one of the most commonly 
cited reasons for not serving. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really don't want to serve on another jury because I really fear for making 
a wrong decision," said Fernando Ponce, 38, a longshoreman who served on a hung 
jury several years ago in Norwalk. 
</P>
<P>
 "You hear the defendant's side of the case," he said, "and it sounds 
convincing. And then you hear the other side, and now you are confused." 
</P>
<P>
 Almost two-thirds of the respondents, particularly women and lower-income 
citizens, said serving on a jury would cause them hardship. 
</P>
<P>
 The prospect of being sequestered was particularly odious, the poll found. By 
59% to 34%, potential jurors said they would resist serving on a jury if they 
had to be isolated from family and friends. A majority also said they would try 
to get out of a trial that lasted more than two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though residents doubt the competence of county jurors, the poll found 
that people who have served are actually better-educated than the average 
population. 
</P>
<P>
 Sixty-six percent of previous jurors have at least some college education, 
compared to 47% with that level of schooling in the general population. Past 
jurors also tend to be better off financially than the average population and 
older than 45. 
</P>
<P>
 Prior jurors were substantially less cynical about juries, with 54% declaring 
that the system works well in criminal cases and four out of every five 
describing their jury experience as satisfying. Only 8% said the last jury they 
served on split by gender, and only 15% said the panel divided racially. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jury service is probably a good way to improve faith in the jury system," 
Brennan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Aileen Placensia, 28, a Long Beach teacher, was among those whose jury 
experience inspired confidence. She was an alternate juror in an attempted 
murder case, but she agreed with the other jurors that the prosecution had not 
proved its case. 
</P>
<P>
 "We knew he did it," said Placensia, whose brother is a prosecutor. "But the 
prosecution didn't prove it so we couldn't convict. . . . I don't think the 
problem is with the jury. The problem is more with the prosecution and what 
they have to prove." 
</P>
<P>
 The Times poll also found that county residents have significant doubts about 
police in their community. Nearly half of the respondents said racism is common 
among their law enforcement officers, and 40% believe police officers commonly 
lie on the witness stand. 
</P>
<P>
 A plurality of 47% thought perjury by police officers was uncommon. Among past 
jurors, 59% said it was infrequent. 
</P>
<P>
 African Americans were most likely to believe police are racist (70%), 
followed by majorities of Asians (62%) and Latinos (56%). But even a third of 
whites agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 Brennan called the finding on police veracity "surprising." Nearly 70% of 
African Americans said police commonly lie under oath, followed by 49% of 
Latinos, 44% of Asians and 26% of whites who believed so. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Police Lt. John Dunkin blamed some of the suspicion of police on 
attacks on officers involved in the Simpson investigation by Simpson's lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think you are hard-pressed to find somebody who has not read something 
about this trial, who hasn't been exposed to the defense team's attacks on the 
credibility of these officers," Dunkin said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times poll, conducted Sept. 17-23, surveyed 1,703 Los Angeles County 
residents, including 1,038 residents who are eligible to serve on juries and 
355 people who have served in the past. The margin of sampling error for all 
respondents, including eligible jurors, was plus or minus 3 percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
 More than two out of five of all those polled criticized the Los Angeles 
County court system as biased against some groups, with many singling out 
African Americans and Latinos as the most likely victims. A whopping 77% of 
blacks believe the system is unfair, compared to 52% of Latinos, 32% of whites 
and 30% of Asians. 
</P>
<P>
 Dale Fearson, 35, an African American businesswoman from West Hollywood, 
summed up suspicions by blacks of juries, courts and the police with one word: 
"History." 
</P>
<P>
 "People don't forget quickly," she said. "Why would you expect them to have 
faith . . . when it wasn't that long ago that they couldn't be a juror, 
couldn't vote? If someone said you committed a crime, particularly in certain 
states, you would have to be O. J. Simpson to get out of it." 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyers, like the rest of the criminal justice system, scored poorly in the 
poll. Clear majorities of the respondents said they have "only some or very 
little" faith in criminal defense attorneys and prosecutors, with both groups 
getting equally poor endorsements. Medical doctors, by contrast, received a 61% 
positive confidence rating. 
</P>
<P>
 Greg Totten, executive director of the California District Attorneys Assn., 
attributed the findings to recent controversial cases, such as the state trial 
of the police officers accused of beating motorist Rodney G. King. 
</P>
<P>
 "The results haven't always responded to the perception of a just verdict. . . 
," he said. "I think people are more cynical about the system and those who 
have important responsibilities in it than they used to be." 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Broderick, executive director of the California Attorneys for Criminal 
Justice, which represents 2,400 criminal defense attorneys, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "When someone is acquitted, they blame the system," she said, even though 
other factors, such as weak or poorly presented evidence, may have influenced 
the outcome more. 
</P>
<P>
 Although suspects are supposed to be presumed innocent until proven otherwise, 
61% of those surveyed said they believe someone is probably guilty when brought 
to trial. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of the public believes if somebody is arrested, they must have committed 
the crime," said Los Angeles criminal defense attorney Barry Tarlow, "otherwise 
why did the police arrest this particular person. I find the statistics not 
surprising, but extremely troubling." 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, four out of five agreed that the prosecution has the duty to 
prove guilt, with more than half "strongly" approving of that legal 
requirement. 
</P>
<P>
 Even as respondents accused juries of failing to put aside personal beliefs, 
they admitted that they would have trouble ignoring what they have heard about 
the Simpson case if selected for his jury. 
</P>
<P>
 Respondents were divided over whether it would be difficult (46%) or easy 
(49%) for them to decide on a verdict without considering what they already 
know. But 50% also said they are unsure whether Simpson is guilty of 
first-degree murder in the killings of his former wife and her friend. 
</P>
<P>
 Queried about jury reform, almost 60% favored requiring jurors to have a 
minimum level of education to improve the system, and 51% said juries should 
reflect the racial, ethnic and gender distribution of the community. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ironically," Brennan said, "the most popular argument is mandatory 
educational requirements for jurors, even though the poll shows the level for 
past jurors is already well over that for the county generally." 
</P>
<P>
 Fifty percent of the respondents said juries should be allowed to reach 
majority verdicts instead of unanimous decisions in criminal cases, a 
suggestion made several months ago by Los Angeles County Dist. Atty. Gil 
Garcetti. Asians supported majority verdicts by 62%, Latinos by 57%, whites by 
46% and blacks by 42%. 
</P>
<P>
 But a plurality believe the system would be worse if judges, rather than 
juries, determined guilt or innocence. Only 34% said that transferring the 
authority to judges would improve the system, and 43% believed it would weaken 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 "A jury would be better than a judge," said Long Beach resident Edith Downey, 
56. "A judge is only one person. You get a more unbiased view if it is a jury." 
</P>
<P>
 The poll found that 62% of the county's eligible jurors work for a living. 
Asked if their employers would pay for jury duty, 37% said no, 31% said yes and 
a substantial 22% did not know. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those with employers willing to pay, the majority said they would 
receive their salary for jury duty for two weeks or less. Only 12% of working 
people said their employers would pay for unlimited jury service. 
</P>
<P>
 Fearson, the West Hollywood businesswoman, was among the 36% who have been 
summoned to jury duty but did not serve. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was in such a pressure-filled, stressful job, I thought it could be a 
vacation," said Fearson, who worked as an accountant at the time. "But my 
employer discouraged it. They said they would have to hire a temp, and 'God 
forbid if they do a better job than you do.' I really got the picture." 
</P>
<P>
 Most past jurors are men, even though the pool of eligible jurors is 
predominantly female. Latinos are "starkly understated" among county residents 
who have served on juries, Brennan said, as well as among the population 
eligible for jury duty. 
</P>
<P>
 The poll director attributed the disparity to language difficulties among some 
Latinos and to the fact that many may not be registered to vote or drive a car. 
Los Angeles County summons jurors from voter registration and Department of 
Motor Vehicles lists, including holders of DMV identification cards. 
</P>
<P>
 Sixteen percent of those surveyed said they had served on a jury. Nearly half 
said they never have been called for jury duty, including 62% of the Latinos, 
51% of Asians, 41% of African Americans and 32% of whites. 
</P>
<P>
 Three-quarters of those who never served but received a summons said they were 
excused from jury duty without having to appear at a courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got out of it," said Don Hofreiter, 31, a Long Beach salesman. "Because of 
the line of work I am in, a few days would be OK, but not two or three weeks. I 
think part of the problem with the jury system is the people who can afford to 
sit on it." 
</P>
<P>
 Beth Bonora, president of the National Jury Project/West, an Oakland jury 
consulting firm, said the Times poll shows that a public education effort is 
needed to improve attitudes toward juries and increase the willingness to 
serve. 
</P>
<P>
 "There has been a lot of public criticism of the jury system in the last 10 
years," she said, "and not an insignificant amount of it has come from ad 
campaigns by manufacturing associations and the insurance industry . . . I 
think it is a terrific system, and it disturbs me that people may be losing 
faith in it." About This Series

</P>
<P>
 The Times Poll interviewed 1,703 Los Angeles County adults, including 1,038 
residents who are eligible to serve on juries and 355 people who have served in 
the past, by telephone, Sept. 17 through 23. Telephone numbers were chosen from 
a list of all exchanges in the county. Random-digit dialing techniques were 
used so listed and non-listed numbers could be contacted. Interviewing was 
conducted in English and Spanish. The sample was weighted slightly to conform 
with census figures for sex, race, age and education. The margin of sampling 
error for the total sample and eligible jurors is plus or minus 3 percentage 
points. For certain subgroups the error margin may be somewhat higher. Poll 
results can also be affected by other factors, such as question wording and the 
order in which questions are presented. Excuses, Excuses, Excuses 
</P>
<P>
 Many are called but relatively few ever serve on juries. Here are some of the 
excuses culled from the files of the Los Angeles County office of the jury 
commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am livering (sic) in another city. I can't do jury service." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 "I have the dizzy flu and I fell on my head. Now hopefully I will be better 
soon." 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 "Glad to serve, if I could get a ride to Los Angeles County from Folsom State 
Prison." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 "I cannot serve. I am under my doctor's car. (sic)" THE TIMES POLL: Attitudes 
and Opinions 
</P>
<P>
 The poll found that about three-quarters of Los Angeles County residents are 
eligible for jury service. To be eligible, potential jurors must be citizens, 
speak English and be registered to vote or hold a California driver's license. 
They cannot be peace officers, cannot have served on a jury in the last 12 
months and cannot be convicted felons. Sixteen percent of county residents have 
served on a criminal or civil jury in the county.

GIS TAKE OVER MOST DREADED HAITI POLICE POST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH FREED, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 U.S. soldiers took another significant step in dissolving Haiti's military 
authority Monday, entering the country's most feared police station in a move 
that marks the downfall of Lt. Col. Michel-Joseph Francois, Haiti's most 
dreaded policeman. 
</P>
<P>
 Coming less than a week after U.S. troops abolished the Haitian army's most 
important unit, the Heavy Weapons Company, Monday's action at the downtown 
police headquarters, and at three other important stations, in effect 
eliminated even the appearance of the military's power. 
</P>
<P>
 The next step, U.S. officials said, will be the identification and 
registration of the 1,500 policemen as a precursor to the purging of the force 
and its separation from the army, a major goal of the U.S. troops who arrived a 
week ago to secure the end of Haiti's military dictatorship. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officers denied they were occupying the downtown police headquarters, 
saying they were there only "to assist and cooperate with the police." But 
their presence certainly looked like an occupation and sounded like an 
occupation. 
</P>
<P>
 And the people certainly thought it was an occupation -- one that sent them 
into ecstasy when two armored U.S. military police vehicles pulled up at 10 
a.m. to the 59-year-old architectural monstrosity on the jammed Gran Rue. 
</P>
<P>
 While some U.S. troops walked through the structure and others stood guard out 
front, M-16 assault rifles slung from their shoulders, dozens of confused 
Haitian police in blue uniforms looked on sullenly from inside, the only noise 
the sound of dominoes being slammed on a table where arrested people used to be 
interrogated. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside, the noise was deafening as thousands, and then tens of thousands, of 
people headed into downtown, dancing and chanting and turning the area into one 
of delighted bedlam. 
</P>
<P>
 Popularly called the Cafeteria because that is what the police building was 
when first built in 1935, the massive, dirty-yellow structure represented all 
that was ugly and grotesque in Haiti's murderous police. 
</P>
<P>
 By the accounting of human rights organizations, hundreds of people have died 
or disappeared after being taken to the Cafeteria; thousands more have been 
beaten and tortured in its fetid and windowless cells. 
</P>
<P>
 "When they take you in at night," goes a local saying about the station, "they 
take you in the morning to the body dump." 
</P>
<P>
 To 69-year-old Jean Elie, the U.S. presence was liberating. "These are good 
times," he said, "good times. Before, I was afraid to even look in there," he 
said of the building's dark entryway. 
</P>
<P>
 He could look now, and he joined a large group of Haitians laughing and 
chanting at the police, "They are afraid!" 
</P>
<P>
 The Cafeteria also was the headquarters of Francois, then an army major, 
during the military overthrow of Jean-Bertrand Aristide, the country's only 
elected president, on Sept. 30, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sweet Mickey," as he is derisively called behind his back, built a reputation 
for brutality and corruption while commander of the Cafeteria -- a brand he 
carried with him when he named himself national police chief after the coup. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the end of Francois," a diplomat said. "He's out of here." Francois 
is -- along with Lt. Gen. Raoul Cedras, the army commander in chief, and Brig. 
Gen. Philippe Biamby, the army chief of staff -- one of the men the United 
Nations wants removed from power. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, the Americans' takeover of police stations Monday came earlier than 
expected. 
</P>
<P>
 Friends of Francois had said privately over the weekend that he would be 
leaving Haiti in the next few days -- before any such U.S. move -- so he could 
avoid the humiliation of being on hand when he lost control. 
</P>
<P>
 Francois, the reclusive 37-year-old son of an army Palace Guard major who 
served during the bloody reign of Francois (Papa Doc) Duvalier, showed either 
defiance or cowardice by refusing to meet with Col. Michael Sullivan, the U.S. 
military police commander who is engineering the dismantling of the Haitian 
force. 
</P>
<P>
 Haitian police did not resist when the American troops approached the 
Cafeteria, although the inability or refusal of the U.S. soldiers to break up 
the demonstration brought a protest from the Cafeteria commander, Capt. Josue 
Montheville. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the people stay here in front of my troops, they could become very angry; 
it could be very bad," he told a reporter. "If the people do not go from there, 
it will not be good for my troops." 
</P>
<P>
 According to U.S. Staff Sgt. Robert Egnor, the Haitian police "wanted to do 
their job their way," meaning to attack the demonstrators. "We don't want them 
to," Egnor said. 
</P>
<P>
 The move against the police, whom U.S. troops had already told to stop beating 
demonstrators, was not the only significant event. 
</P>
<P>
 * Looters raided two warehouses in the western town of Gonaives, one belonging 
to the United Nations and one to a private French volunteer organization. 
</P>
<P>
 * U.S. Army spokesmen defended the killing of 10 Haitians by Marines during 
the weekend in a firefight in the northern city of Cap Haitien. Acknowledging 
that a Marine fired the first shot, Col. Barry Willey told reporters that the 
battle opened after a Haitian raised an Uzi submachine gun "with clear hostile 
intent." 
</P>
<P>
 Willey also said a demand by Cedras that the U.S. troops be punished was 
rejected. "There won't be any court-martial," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cap Haitien was peaceful Monday, and in their first patrols outside the city, 
Marines ventured to two nearby towns, Grande Riviere and Limbe. There, local 
residents voluntarily handed over to the Americans about 75 automatic and 
semiautomatic weapons, in addition to some handguns -- though the soldiers said 
the old weapons were useless. 
</P>
<P>
 * The United States will begin buying arms from Haitian civilians today, "to 
remove illegal weapons to create a secure environment," according to Willey. 
Payment for the weapons, generally well below black market rates, will be $50 
for handguns, $100 for semiautomatic rifles, $200 for machine guns, $300 for 
mortars and $100 for grenades and other explosives. 
</P>
<P>
 * U.S. Embassy spokesman Stanley Shrager announced Monday that U.S. troops 
will guard the Parliament when it opens Wednesday for the first time in nearly 
a year to debate an amnesty law for Cedras, Biamby and Francois.

EARLIER INTERVENTION HOLDS LESSONS FOR U.S. IN HAITI; OCCUPATION: PUBLIC 
IMPROVEMENTS DIDN'T LAST. ILL WILL CREATED BY RACISM THEN COULD SNARL RELATIONS 
NOW. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 With their flags rippling and Springfield rifles held high, 330 Marines and 
sailors splashed through the tepid surf near Port-au-Prince on a mission to 
save Haiti from the Haitians. 
</P>
<P>
 It was 1915, and the country's ruler had been dismembered by a mob in a burst 
of anarchy that President Woodrow Wilson considered a threat to America's sea 
lanes and investors. Wilson declared the turmoil "a public nuisance on our 
doorstep," and called for a swift restoration of order. 
</P>
<P>
 Nineteen years later, the American diplomats and dogfaces were still there. 
And they had met with disagreeable surprises: sullen resistance from the 
political class; angry divisions among Haitians, and sporadic rebellion that 
ultimately made the occupation an embarrassment in the eyes of many at home and 
abroad. 
</P>
<P>
 When it was all over, the Americans' proud improvements -- from government 
offices to bridges, hospitals, sewers and roads -- were quickly lost to neglect 
and advancing tropical undergrowth. 
</P>
<P>
 That occupation differs in its motive and execution from the one begun last 
week to restore President Jean-Bertrand Aristide. But as newly deployed U.S. 
troops contemplate their still hazily defined mission, the episode offers a 
cautionary lesson of the difficulties of one country imposing its will on a 
land so troubled, so poor and -- quite simply -- so different. 
</P>
<P>
 The history points up the risks Americans face as they try to pacify a country 
that has been riven for two centuries by factional fighting and where American 
intentions are viewed with suspicion -- even, it is increasingly clear, by 
Aristide himself. And in its outcome, the first occupation raises questions of 
the lasting value of the current mission, in which the United States has 
already committed nearly $1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 As they have recently found in places like Rwanda, Somalia and Iraq, American 
forces must find their way through the deep-dyed loyalties, long hatreds and 
inexplicable twists of local history to carry out their mission. 
</P>
<P>
 To outsiders, Haiti's history is as impenetrable as any. The nation was born 
violently in the struggle of African slaves to throw off their colonial French 
masters; the two centuries since have seen a rarely interrupted clash of the 
tiny mixed-race upper class and their military retainers with the impoverished 
remainder of the population. 
</P>
<P>
 And the occupiers' efforts to deal with the situation may be further snarled 
by poisonous memories of the bitter encounter of the 1920s when the Americans 
-- whose country was then gripped in a period of fevered racism -- considered 
Haitians little more than animals and never hesitated to say so. 
</P>
<P>
 One of President Clinton's allies, Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan (D-N.Y.), 
cited history's lesson last week as he delivered his own negative judgment on 
the prospect of an invasion. "When we were there last time, Woodrow Wilson got 
us in and Franklin Roosevelt got us out," Moynihan said. "Nineteen years." 
</P>
<P>
 America's first intervention came at a time when Caribbean incursions by the 
United States were regular and rarely accompanied by public debate or even much 
notice. In Haiti's case, it seemed to Wilson there was more than sufficient 
justification for military action, on grounds of military security and economic 
interests. 
</P>
<P>
 The Germans, one year into war in Europe, seemed about to strike a deal to 
build a naval base in Haiti that could directly threaten the American lifeline 
through the Panama Canal. And the latest sudden change in government -- the 
102nd in 75 years -- raised Wilson's fears that Haiti's debts would go unpaid 
and that some European power might step in to collect them. 
</P>
<P>
 Vilbron Guillaume Sam, the latest Haitian military chieftain, had killed 165 
political opponents before he was seized from the French Legation and torn limb 
from limb by the mob. The American charge d'affaires witnessed a man parading 
by with Sam's severed thumb in his mouth as a fevered procession bore Sam's 
remains through the capital. 
</P>
<P>
 The Marine landing subsequently ordered by Wilson was accompanied by only two 
American casualties -- both, it was later concluded, from self-inflicted 
wounds. There were few Haitian casualties and initial resistance by guerrilla 
bands in the mountains was snuffed out within six months. 
</P>
<P>
 As today, many average Haitians welcomed the incursion. 
</P>
<P>
 But for many, those feelings didn't last. 
</P>
<P>
 The Haitian National Assembly soon proved stubbornly resistant to U.S. 
demands, refusing to ratify a new, American-written constitution that would 
have validated the occupation and permitted American ownership of property. So 
the Americans took another route: They pressured their newly installed Haitian 
president to sign an order dissolving the legislature, then had Marine Lt. Col. 
Smedley D. Butler read the proclamation in a public square. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than risk the election of a new legislature that might also prove too 
independent, they organized a plebiscite to ratify the creation of a new 
governing body. Only about 5% of the Haitians showed up to cast ballots beneath 
the stony gaze of Marine guards; perhaps not surprisingly, they voted 
overwhelmingly for the American-sponsored proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 Fearing results they might not like, the Americans didn't allow national 
elections until 1930. And they invalidated the results of local elections that 
were not to their liking. 
</P>
<P>
 Martial law, imposed with the invasion, was maintained for a decade. The 
Americans censored the press and jailed editors who broke the rules; they 
forced Haitians to accept a bilateral treaty that empowered Americans to 
collect taxes, pay debts and oversee local governments. 
</P>
<P>
 Marine officers were appointed to supervise government in local districts. 
</P>
<P>
 All this helped to quickly crystallize the discontent of the French-speaking, 
mixed-race ruling class, which represented about 5% of Haitians. That 
resentment was only reinforced by the personal treatment they got from 
Americans who considered them a lower order than the ruling classes of the 
Spanish-speaking territories they occupied in the Caribbean and the Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
 The Americans wouldn't mix socially with them, and even in public statements 
referred to them in the most contemptuous terms. Adm. William Caperton, the 
naval commander in Haiti when the 1915 crisis began, described President Sam as 
"a very gorgeous black gentleman, arrayed like a head bellhop at the Waldorf." 
</P>
<P>
 "These are a proud people, and they resented it very much," said Richard A. 
Best, a defense analyst at the Congressional Research Service. 
</P>
<P>
 The Americans -- including Wilson, the famous evangelist for democracy -- 
never believed the Haitians capable of self-government and made no effort to 
build U.S.-style democratic institutions in the country. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Americans did make a considerable effort to maintain order. 
</P>
<P>
 From 1918 to 1920, the Marine Brigade and the local constabulary they had 
organized, the Gendarmerie d'Haiti, fought throughout the countryside to subdue 
cacos , guerrilla bands that took refuge in the mountains. (Cacos is variously 
translated as a predatory bird or angry red ant.) 
</P>
<P>
 The Americans were largely successful in the campaign, which cost the lives of 
15 Marines and an estimated 2,000 cacos.  
</P>
<P>
 But it required that the Marines -- who never numbered more than about 2,500 
-- maintain regular patrols, pay bounties for weapons and sometimes eliminate 
rebel leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 One spur to popular discontent was a system of forced labor, the corvee, under 
which Haitians were pressed into service for several days shoveling earth and 
cracking boulders to build 800 miles of unpaved roads. The system, transplanted 
from France, was based on a notion that even citizens too poor to pay taxes 
owed some contribution to the state. 
</P>
<P>
 The corvee camps initially had some popularity with some rural Haitians 
because workers were fed, sheltered and even entertained, wrote Robert and 
Nancy Heinl in their 1978 Haitian history, "Written in Blood." But that 
attitude faded, particularly as some better-educated city dwellers were caught 
in the corvee's net. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon it had become a source of widespread resentment and the basis of a 
popular conception that "the whites are come hither to restore slavery; the 
corvee is only the beginning," according to the Heinls' book. 
</P>
<P>
 When the outside world saw pictures of rope-bound road gangs, there was an 
outcry against this seeming restoration of slavery in the onetime French slave 
colony. But by the time corvee was abolished by the Marine command in 1918, it 
was too late to erase its popular significance. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, like most U.S. interventions of the time, the Marines' actions in Haiti 
drew little public notice in the United States. One exception was in 1922, when 
charges of American atrocities in the campaign to put down the cacos led 
Congress to hold hearings. 
</P>
<P>
 In a committee report, Congress concluded that most abuses had occurred in the 
battle to put down the insurrection. But it acknowledged that there were at 
least 10 illegal executions by Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 A second round of hearings came after 1929 riots, led by student 
demonstrators, in the provincial city of Les Cayes. The beginning of the Great 
Depression had driven down prices for Haitian coffee and other farm products, 
causing hardship and raising complaints about the stewardship of a government 
that included no real Haitian voice. 
</P>
<P>
 Twelve Haitians died in the disorder, hastening a shift in U.S. public opinion 
that, amid deepening domestic problems, was already turning against such 
foreign commitments. On a presidential commission's advice, the Herbert Hoover 
Administration took halfway steps to greater home rule; some Haitians were 
added to the government. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, the Hoover Administration found it difficult to fully withdraw 
because of concern that the country would not remain stable and solvent. 
</P>
<P>
 Not until 1934 did Americans finally leave Haiti -- and even then, they left 
behind a financial monitor to ensure that the debt payments would continue. 
</P>
<P>
 By some measures, the occupation had benefited Haitians. Haiti was financially 
stable, foreign debts were paid, political violence was largely contained and 
Haitians were more secure than before. 
</P>
<P>
 By all accounts, the Haitians' treasury was not plundered by its American 
stewards. The Americans had help set up a Haitian-funded health service of 153 
rural clinics and 11 hospitals, supervised by Navy doctors. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet with the Americans' departure, the fruits of this labor fell into 
immediate disuse. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert White, a former U.S. ambassador in Latin America, believes most 
comparisons of the two occupations are misleading, because the current mission 
has the support of most Haitians. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, he acknowledges that such an undertaking is likely to meet serious 
obstacles. "Any time you have a military and an elite that regard democracy as 
a threat, there will be grave difficulties." 
</P>
<P>
 And, as in earlier decades, there is a risk that the Americans will alienate 
the Haitian leadership, even as they try to bring democracy. While the Clinton 
Administration has pledged to strictly limit the American role, "when you come 
in like this, it is almost guaranteed that you won't be loved," said Gaddis 
Smith, professor of diplomatic history at Yale University. 
</P>
<P>
 With Washington's agreement with the Haitian junta, the U.S. military seems to 
face a declining risk of having to fight organized guerrilla warfare from the 
mountains. But, as occurred with the Marines in the Les Cayes riot of 1929, 
they could find themselves in the midst of bloody civil clashes. 
</P>
<P>
 This already happened last Tuesday, when Aristide supporters battled the 
Haitian military in Port-au-Prince as U.S. troops watched. It happened again 
over the weekend in Cap Haitien, where U.S. Marines got into a gun battle in 
which 10 Haitians were killed; emboldened by the Saturday firefight, thousands 
of Haitians on Sunday ransacked police facilities in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. military officials have acknowledged that being forced to disentangle 
combatants is one of the roles they fear most. 
</P>
<P>
 As in the earlier occupation, the United States may find it takes far longer 
than Washington had hoped for Haiti to reach a point when outside forces can 
leave without the risk of a reversion to the old ways. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you get involved like this, there's simply no guarantee that you'll be 
able to leave when you want to," said Hugh DeSantis, a defense specialist at 
the National War College. "The bottom line is, there's no guarantee that 
because you have democratic ideals, the people you support are going to put 
them into practice."

COLUMN ONE; HONG KONG REAL ESTATE GETS UNREAL; EVEN A PARKING SPACE CAN COST 
$125,000 IN THE COLONY'S CRAZY HOUSING MARKET. LOCAL BUYERS ARE BEING SQUEEZED 
OUT, FOREIGNERS MUST RELOCATE AND EVERYONE FEARS THE BUBBLE SOON MAY BURST.

<P>
 When banker Doug Lawson moved his family here recently from Singapore, he 
learned the hard way what real estate agents are fond of calling "shock 
therapy, Hong Kong-style." 
</P>
<P>
 The first jolt came when he finally found an apartment big enough to house his 
wife, Laura, and four children. The apartment, on the 30th floor of a high-rise 
in trendy Tai Tam on Hong Kong Island, was less than half the size of his 
former townhouse in Singapore. 
</P>
<P>
 The rent: a lofty $9,000 a month. 
</P>
<P>
 The second shock came the next day when he sent in a check to secure the 
lease. The landlord claimed to have other tenants ready to move in and bumped 
the rent up to a budget-busting $11,000 a month. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't have a choice," Lawson recalled. "I had to sign before they raised 
it any more. It's just crazy out there." 
</P>
<P>
 Move over, Tokyo. In the unreal world of Hong Kong real estate, prices for 
everything from offices to parking spaces are now among the world's highest. 
Monthly apartment rentals in five figures are not uncommon, while lucky owners 
of apartments have seen their small down payments blossom into 
multimillion-dollar fortunes. 
</P>
<P>
 At one benchmark complex, the Royal Cliff, in an area favored by Americans on 
the south side of Hong Kong, apartments go for $25,000 a month. A house on 
Victoria Peak, Hong Kong's swankiest address, recently sold for a record $35 
million to a buyer who wants to put a housing development in the home's back 
garden. 
</P>
<P>
 "My agents always keep a box of tissues in the car," said Jan McNally, 
associate director for residential property at broker Richard Ellis, which 
caters to American and British executives. "The wives always cry on the first 
day out looking at what's available." 
</P>
<P>
 Underlying the high prices is tremendous demand from foreign businessmen 
flooding into the colony hoping to cash in on the boom next door in China, 
combined with an extreme shortage of land in crowded Hong Kong, one of the most 
densely populated areas in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, because Hong Kong's currency is tied directly to the U.S. dollar, 
low interest rates and high inflation have made real estate a much more 
attractive investment than parking spare cash in a bank. 
</P>
<P>
 But the dizzying prices have raised a number of pressing concerns about Hong 
Kong's future. Some multinational companies are beginning to relocate 
administrative staff to less costly locations in China or Singapore. 
</P>
<P>
 Many local couples entering the housing market for the first time can no 
longer afford to either buy or rent an apartment. 
</P>
<P>
 But most worrisome of all is the possibility of a collapse in property prices 
of the magnitude experienced in Los Angeles and Tokyo in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 By some estimates, property accounts for more than 60% of the Hong Kong stock 
market and a sudden downturn could have a major impact on the economy of the 
territory, and in adjoining Chinese provinces. Many see a real estate crunch as 
a greater threat to Hong Kong's future than its scheduled hand-over to Chinese 
rule in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
 Sensing that the market was severely overheating, Hong Kong's British rulers 
took steps in June to deflate the property market gently. Prices have already 
come down more than 10% and many speculators have moved to the sidelines, at 
least for now. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, almost half of Hong Kong's 6 million residents are 
insulated from the immediate effects of the high costs because they live in 
public housing developments where the rent is as little as $135 a month. There 
were cries of outrage recently when the government reported that nearly 
one-sixth of the families in public housing also owned private apartments for 
speculative purposes, even though the apartments are reserved for low-income 
families. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point, real estate was in such demand that members of Triad gangs, 
wearing the signature white gloves of Hong Kong's underworld hoodlums, tried to 
gain control of the huge lines of prospective buyers trying to get into new 
real estate deals. The government responded by adopting strict laws requiring 
property owners to sell new developments by lottery under the supervision of an 
accounting firm. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're gradually letting the air out of the balloon," said Fanny Law, deputy 
secretary for planning, environment and lands. "There was too much speculation 
in the market, and prices pushed up too rapidly, driving out the genuine 
homeowners." 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, skeptics like Swiss fund manager Marc Faber, a renowned pessimist 
about Hong Kong real estate, believe the market is heading for a selloff of 
major proportions. "In real terms, I doubt if property prices will ever rise 
this high again. Forever." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Faber's view is still not widely shared, Hong Kong banks have sharply 
curtailed their lending to avoid the kind of crisis that buffeted the U.S. 
savings and loan industry in the late 1980s. At least two major banks have 
stopped providing mortgages because they have reached their government-imposed 
ceiling of 40% of assets in real estate loans. At other major banks, getting a 
mortgage has become much harder. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Broadbent, a spokesman for the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corp., 
the territory's largest bank, said buyers now need to put up 50% of the 
purchase price in cash for apartments costing more than $675,000, up from the 
10% demanded last year. Less expensive apartments require a 30% down payment. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't see a collapse," Broadbent said. "Fundamentally, demand is there. 
Hong Kong is still very strong." 
</P>
<P>
 According to First Pacific Davies, a real estate firm that closely tracks the 
market, residential rental prices have surged 53% in the last year, while 
apartment sale prices have soared an average of 38% and office rents have risen 
47.3%. Those increases have affected everyone in Hong Kong, from those in 
$20,000-a-month luxury apartments in prime districts to $1,000-a-month 
tenements in the back streets of poor neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 As in Los Angeles in the 1980s, real estate has become a Hong Kong obsession, 
a recurring theme of cocktail parties and dinner conversations. Those who have 
made a killing can't resist exulting, while those who stayed out of the market 
forever lament their misfortune. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the most boring things about Hong Kong is people must talk about how 
much money they make, and especially how much money they have made in real 
estate," said Stuart Wolfendale, a popular columnist for the Eastern Express 
newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
 He noted that high-priced real estate is driving out many artisans and writers 
who can no longer afford the rents. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, prices of apartments are so high that small-time speculators have 
developed a niche market for parking spaces. A spot in a good location costs 
more than $125,000, car not included. 
</P>
<P>
 "Imagine paying more for a parking space in Hong Kong than for a house in 
Australia!" said Isabel B. Michie, residential director at First Pacific 
Davies. "While housing prices in Britain have increased by three times in the 
last 10 years, in Hong Kong housing prices have increased six times." 
</P>
<P>
 Office space is even more precious than apartments; offices in Exchange 
Square, the Hong Kong equivalent of Wall Street, rent for $14 a square foot per 
month, one of the world's steepest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 One sign of the burgeoning value of office space: Seven major hotels have been 
pulled down in recent months to make way for office towers, despite a hotel 
occupancy rate of 85% in the territory. Even the landmark Hong Kong Hilton, 
which just completed a $12-million renovation, announced that it was closing 
its doors in January. At current prices, each of the Hilton's 750 rooms is 
estimated to be worth more than $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The engine driving the property boom at the top end of the market is a surge 
in foreign business people setting up shop in the territory as a base camp for 
doing business in China's booming economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Official immigration figures show the number of Americans in Hong Kong has 
gone from 19,300 in 1990 to 29,500 in May, 1994. Equally dramatic increases 
have been registered for Japanese, British, Australian and Canadian business 
people. 
</P>
<P>
 Gerald L. Murdock, chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce, noted that 
the high rents have failed, so far, to deter many companies from setting up 
operations here. "If China is your No. 1 priority, Hong Kong is on its 
doorstep," Murdock said. "There's nobody even close for doing business in 
Asia." 
</P>
<P>
 Many American companies are keeping their U.S. executives in Hong Kong rather 
than China because prices are almost as high in Beijing and Shanghai, and most 
Chinese cities lack basic amenities such as schools with a curriculum for 
foreign students. 
</P>
<P>
 The market appears to have been driven by U.S. financial institutions, which 
have poured personnel into Hong Kong in the last two years to take advantage of 
the region's economic boom. The investment bank of Salomon Brothers, for 
example, had only 60 employees in Hong Kong 18 months ago, but now has 250, 
mostly expatriates. "We've seen doubling rents in that time," said Jim Ward, 
head of human resources at the investment house. "We're trying to hold the 
line." 
</P>
<P>
 Companies such as Merrill Lynch, Unisys and Britain's Standard Chartered Bank 
have moved a substantial number of employees to Singapore, where rents are 
about half as high. But most companies cite operational reasons other than the 
high cost of real estate for their moves. 
</P>
<P>
 Cathay Pacific, Hong Kong's international air carrier, has been aggressively 
trying to move jobs out of the territory. Last year, it transferred some of its 
accounting operations to Guangzhou in China and recruited 250 people locally. 
It is moving its data center to Sydney, Australia, in 1995 "because of cheap 
land," said Cathay Pacific spokesman C. F. Kwan. 
</P>
<P>
 Cathay also has offered its pilots, who are predominantly British or American, 
the option of living in their countries of origin. Cathay gets to keep its 
$7,000-a-month or so housing allowance, while the pilots commute to work from 
as far as Los Angeles. So far, 100 out of the airline's 1,100 pilots have 
volunteered for the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 One intrepid Australian businessman, an insurance broker named Clive 
Wolstencroft, even commutes to work here from Macao, the Portuguese colony that 
lies across the Pearl River estuary from Hong Kong. Wolstencroft endures a 
three-hour daily commute by hydrofoil but says he is able to afford a house 
with a swimming pool at half the cost of a Hong Kong apartment. 
</P>
<P>
 While few executives are emulating Wolstencroft's marathon commute, real 
estate agents said that all but the most affluent companies are trying some 
form of "downsizing," such as setting a fixed housing allowance, which either 
requires executives to find smaller apartments or move into outlying districts, 
formerly considered socially unacceptable. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than being a single territory, Hong Kong is a collection of islands off 
China's southern coast, plus the Kowloon Peninsula and the New Territories 
beyond, all linked by ferry, tunnel or rail. 
</P>
<P>
 Most foreigners tend to prefer the British colonial atmosphere of Hong Kong 
Island to the more ethnic Chinese character of Kowloon. But even the New 
Territories, a 90-minute trip from the financial district, are sprouting yuppie 
apartment buildings where rice paddies used to bloom, with incredibly tiny, 
8-by-10-foot "micro-apartments" selling for more than $20,000. 
</P>
<P>
 For those Hong Kong Chinese not protected by public housing, the real estate 
boom has turned some people into millionaires but threatens to undermine new 
families starting out. Newspaper cartoons poke fun at the endless battles 
taking place between young wives and mothers-in-law forced by economic 
necessity to share the same roof. 
</P>
<P>
 "The 116% increase in residential property prices recorded in the past three 
years" has outstripped the growth in what people earn, said a study by Hang 
Seng Bank. The result is "that home purchases have become increasingly 
unaffordable to most" buyers. 
</P>
<P>
 Housing prices also have been driven up by another unforeseen phenomenon: the 
return to Hong Kong of thousands of Chinese who emigrated to the United States, 
Canada and Australia after the crackdown on human rights in China during the 
Tian An Men Square demonstrations in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 An estimated 20,000 Hong Kong Chinese with Canadian passports -- known 
colloquially as "astronauts" because they leave their families behind in the 
West and fly back to Hong Kong on business -- have returned home because they 
were struggling to make ends meet overseas. 
</P>
<P>
 Because many sold their homes in the bear market after Tian An Men, a lot of 
the "astronauts" can't find an affordable house in today's Hong Kong.

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / GOVERNOR; BROWN VOWS TO FREEZE COLLEGE FEES IF ELECTED; 
DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATE TELLS STUDENTS SHE WILL FOLLOW THE PRO-EDUCATION PLATFORM 
PIONEERED BY HER FATHER WHEN HE WAS GOVERNOR. WILSON CAMP DISMISSES HER 
PROMISES AS EMPTY RHETORIC.

<P>
 Invoking the higher education legacy of her father, Democrat Kathleen Brown 
accused Republican Gov. Pete Wilson Monday of balancing the state budget on the 
backs of California's college and university students and their families. 
</P>
<P>
 If elected governor Nov. 8, Brown vowed, she will freeze higher education 
tuition and fees at their present levels. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking to about 500 students on the campus of San Diego State University, 
Brown said: "My pledge to you as your governor is to make higher education a 
priority, because I know that you can't earn if you can't learn." 
</P>
<P>
 As she moved toward an exit after her speech, Brown spotted a crudely lettered 
cardboard sign proclaiming: "Hey Pete: When I graduate and you lose, let's go 
job hunting together." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown stopped in front of the sign holder, 21-year-old Alex Yates of San 
Diego, and beamed. Arms at her side, she thrust both thumbs up in a victory 
salute and proclaimed, "Yes!" 
</P>
<P>
 Tuition and fees were raised several times throughout the California higher 
education system during the budget crises that have plagued the Wilson 
Administration since 1991. Brown put the overall boost at 130%. Students in the 
crowd said tuition in the CSU system now is $931 a semester. 
</P>
<P>
 "You and your families have been the hardest hit by four years of Pete 
Wilson's mismanagement of our budget and budget fiascoes, in particular the 
balancing of our state budget on the backs of higher education," Brown said 
during a news conference with student reporters after the rally. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson spokesman Dan Schnur later responded that as state treasurer, Brown had 
abandoned a plan launched by her GOP predecessor to allow middle-class parents 
to save for their children's education costs by buying a form of state bond. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kathleen Brown can make all the promises in the world," Schnur said. "But if 
you're a parent trying to put money aside for your children's education, you've 
already been burned once by her. You're not going to do it a second time." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown opened her speech by recalling the election of her father, Edmund G. 
(Pat) Brown Sr., in 1958, and suggesting that most of the students probably 
weren't old enough to remember that event, 36 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 As she tried to tell the story, a half-dozen protesters standing in back of 
the crowd interrupted repeatedly. The Brown crowd countered by chanting, "No 
Re-Pete." 
</P>
<P>
 Then Brown said, "You know, that's what's wrong with Pete Wilson. When we want 
to debate Pete Wilson, he sends his Wilsonettes. But he's afraid to come here." 
</P>
<P>
 However, some students who stood near the protesters said they opposed both 
Brown and Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 As enough quiet returned for Brown to finish her story, she said her father 
carried 55 of the state's 58 counties in 1958 -- all but San Diego, Orange and 
Santa Cruz. He asked wife Bernice how he could win every county when he ran for 
reelection in 1962. She replied, "Educate them." 
</P>
<P>
 "So guess what Pat Brown did?" daughter Kathleen Brown asked. "He built a 
university in San Diego County. He built a university in Orange County. And he 
built a university in Santa Cruz County." 
</P>
<P>
 The Brown fans cheered. 
</P>
<P>
 But she left off the punch line that Pat Brown always used when he regaled 
crowds with the same yarn: In 1962, he lost San Diego, Orange and Santa Cruz 
counties anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 One of Pat Brown's legacies has been the expansion of California's higher 
education system. He also attempted to keep UC Berkeley tuition-free to 
California students, but his association with the university also helped bring 
about the end of his political career. 
</P>
<P>
 When Brown sought a third term in 1966, Ronald Reagan attacked him and UC 
President Clark Kerr for failing to control student radicals, particularly at 
UC Berkeley. What was extolled on campus as academic freedom was vilified by 
Brown foes as arrogance and excess. 
</P>
<P>
 After Reagan took office in 1967, tuition was imposed at UC for the first time 
and Kerr resigned under pressure from Reagan and his allies on the Board of 
Regents. Political Scorecard 
</P>
<P>
 42 days to go before Californians go to the polls. 
</P>
<P>
 THE GOVERNOR'S RACE 
</P>
<P>
 * What Happened Monday: Gov. Pete Wilson signed legislation spawned by the O. 
J. Simpson murder case that makes it illegal for witnesses and jurors in 
criminal cases to sell their stories until after the trial. State Treasurer 
Kathleen Brown attended a rally at San Diego State University and said she 
would freeze tuition levels. 
</P>
<P>
 * What's Ahead: Today, Brown plans to speak about California's fiscal crisis 
to the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce. Wilson continues to sign legislation in 
Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 THE SENATE RACE 
</P>
<P>
 * What Happened Monday: Sen. Dianne Feinstein attended two fund-raisers in New 
York City. Rep. Mike Huffington visited Crescent City, Eureka and Redding and 
talked about the economic impact of the Endangered Species Act and federal 
timber policy. 
</P>
<P>
 * What's Ahead: Feinstein will be in Washington today fighting to get her 
desert protection legislation through the Senate. Her campaign will hold a news 
conference in San Francisco to denounce "Huffington's latest lies and 
distortions." Arianna Huffington will tour a child-care facility in Duarte and 
then speak to the South Pasadena Women's Club. 
</P>
<P>
 NOTABLE QUOTE 
</P>
<P>
 "I could have done what every politician in California has done. I could have 
changed my position (on the death penalty) like Dianne Feinstein did and 
Barbara Boxer did and Leo McCarthy did and Mel Levine did and Willie Brown did. 
Every single one of them changed their position to run for higher office. I 
couldn't do that the way I was raised. I was raised to believe that politics 
was also about principle and not just politics." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Kathleen Brown in the Sept. 10 issue of the National Journal. (On Monday, 
she said she regretted naming Feinstein, who changed her views in 1973 long 
before seeking higher office. Assembly Speaker Willie Brown has never run for 
higher office.) 
</P>
<P>
 FACE TO FACE 
</P>
<P>
 As California's gubernatorial and Senate candidates continue to snipe over 
debate dates, the combatants in the attorney general's race have shown no 
reluctance to meet face to face. Dan Lungren, the Republican incumbent, and 
Democrat challenger Tom Umberg have agreed to joust on at least 10 occasions 
before Election Day. The first is Thursday on TV in Sacramento.

IRS SEEKING 17,000 PEOPLE IT OWES A TOTAL OF $11 MILLION; TAXES: THESE SOUTHERN 
CALIFORNIANS' REFUND CHECKS WERE RETURNED BECAUSE POST OFFICE COULDN'T FIND 
CURRENT ADDRESSES. 
</P>

 Internal Revenue Service officials announced Monday that they are trying to 
find about 17,000 Southern California taxpayers whom the federal government 
owes more than $11 million, by far the largest booty of homeless tax refunds in 
the country. 
</P>
<P>
 The sprawling Laguna Niguel district of the IRS -- which covers the Long Beach 
and South Bay portions of Los Angeles County and all of Orange, San Diego, 
Riverside, Imperial and San Bernardino counties -- "ranks No. 1 in the nation" 
in uncollected refunds, according to Wilson Fadely, the national IRS spokesman 
in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials in Laguna Niguel are searching for more than 10,000 taxpayers, whom 
the government owes $6.2 million, said spokeswoman Gindy Barnard. Their refund 
checks were returned because the U.S. Postal Service was unable to obtain a 
current address for the recipients, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Los Angeles district, which covers most of Los Angeles County and a 
sliver of Ventura County, the IRS is searching for about 7,000 taxpayers who 
are owed about $5 million, said spokeswoman Diane Cobb. 
</P>
<P>
 "But no other district is even close to those two," Fadely said. 
</P>
<P>
 In figures released throughout the nation on Monday, the government is seeking 
92,000 taxpayers for an unclaimed $54 million, the highest amount of 
uncollected refunds in IRS history, Fadely noted. 
</P>
<P>
 IRS officials say the Los Angeles and Laguna Niguel districts combined are the 
largest in the federal system. Still, the number of uncollected refunds is 
unusual. 
</P>
<P>
 For the most part, IRS officials blamed the high mobility of Southern 
California residents for the undelivered checks, but said that some of that $11 
million includes refunds claimed on tax returns with bogus Social Security 
numbers. 
</P>
<P>
 Barnard said the government has had a problem in recent years with illegal 
immigrants filing returns with phony Social Security numbers in an attempt to 
legitimize residency. In other cases, the numbers simply may have been 
transposed. Either way, the INS must track down the taxpayers and rectify the 
problem before refunds are issued, she said. And in these cases, the IRS can't 
find them. 
</P>
<P>
 This has been more of a problem in Southern California than in other parts of 
the country, she said, although the government does not keep statistics on 
uncollected refunds resulting from the fake Social Security numbers. 
</P>
<P>
 "The vast majority of uncollected refunds are due primarily to people moving 
so frequently," Barnard said. "That, too, tends to happen more often in 
Southern California than in other parts of the country." 
</P>
<P>
 Vivian Doche-Boulos, chief demographer for the Southern California Assn. of 
Governments, agreed, and blamed the state's economic woes on much of the 
transiency. 
</P>
<P>
 "We Californians move much more than the national average," Doche-Boulos said. 
"Especially in the last four or five years and mainly because of the economy. A 
lot of the movement is within Southern California, but in recent years, a lot 
of people have abandoned the region altogether, leaving nary a trace. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because of the recession, our outflow has been much greater than our intake. 
So these (IRS) figures don't surprise me at all." 
</P>
<P>
 IRS officials say the uncollected refunds range from $100 to $3,000 and 
average about $650. If they aren't claimed within three years, they are turned 
over to the general fund of the government for "deficit-busting," Fadely said. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we finally do locate the people, they're usually disgusted that we 
couldn't find them," Barnard said. "A lot of the time, though, they're 
embarrassed that they failed to notify us or that that much money almost fell 
through the cracks." 
</P>
<P>
 IRS officials said they are as vigilant about tracking down people with money 
coming to them as they are in tracking taxpayers who owe the government money. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone who thinks the might be due a refund can call 800-829-1040. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to give away money for a change," Barnard said. "Contrary to our 
image, of course."

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS; SIGNING UP NEW VOTERS IS NO JOB FOR THE SHY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Rowland Johnson knows you want to avoid him. He can see it in your eyes, from 
the moment you spot the clipboard in his hand or read his red, white and blue 
sign: "Democrats Register to Vote Here." But Johnson is difficult to ignore. 
</P>
<P>
 "How you doing, ma'am? Are you registered?" He has placed himself between you 
and your destination -- in this case the grocery store -- and as you speed up, 
he matches your stride. "I know you want to get rid of Pete Wilson," he says, 
smiling warmly and greeting all excuses with a polite shake of his head. "It'll 
only take a minute." 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson, who works nights driving a forklift, is by day one of the Democratic 
Party's most persuasive registrars. To sign up just a few more Democrats, he 
carries groceries, comforts babies, even push-starts a stalled car. "I don't 
have no time," said the man whose car he helped revive the other day at Slauson 
and Vermont Avenues. Johnson refused to be denied. "You would have been here 15 
minutes if I hadn't come along," he said, winking as he handed the man a pen. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 What if the state of California held an election and nobody came? As the 
murder trial of O. J. Simpson threatens to eclipse the Nov. 8 election, the 
battle to energize voters has taken on a new intensity. And Johnson, 38, is on 
the front line. 
</P>
<P>
 He and 17 other men and women staff the Crenshaw office of the California 
Democratic Party's Ironing Board Project, a statewide voter registration drive 
named for the ironing boards the workers carry with them as tables. The 
Democratic Party is paying several hundred people throughout California up to 
$8 an hour to do what Johnson does. 
</P>
<P>
 What if a Republican wants to register? "We train people to say, 'We're 
registering Democrats. Have a nice day!' " said Jim Alford, coordinator of the 
project, one of several party-sponsored registration drives that seek to sign 
up a total of 600,000 new Democrats before the Oct. 11 deadline. "We have to 
give a (registration) card to anyone who requests it. But we don't have to 
assist them." 
</P>
<P>
 Not to worry. The Republican Party has its own registration effort, called 
Operation Bounty, which is seeking to sign up 244,000 new GOP voters. 
Volunteers do most of the recruiting, said John Peschong, a party spokesman. 
But to provide an incentive, the state party pays its county organizations 
$2.50 per new registrant. And it has hired a professional firm to register tens 
of thousands more. 
</P>
<P>
 The two partisan armies tend to canvass different neighborhoods. GOP 
recruiters often head for the suburbs, while Democrats focus largely on urban 
areas, like Johnson's turf: South-Central Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Lately, Johnson and his colleagues have signed up nearly 2,000 Democrats a 
week in neighborhoods both blighted and bustling. "Keys to Success," says a 
handwritten list posted on the wall. "Positive Attitude. Eye Contact. Talk to 
Everybody." There are easier ways to make a buck. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you're shy and really quiet, this is not the job for you," Y'Londa 
Pressey, the director of the Crenshaw office, told her colleagues the other day 
just before their six-hour shift began. "If you've got to swing your arm, swing 
it out. Get their attention." 
</P>
<P>
 Turning to Johnson, who once signed up a whopping 58 people in a single day, 
she grinned. "Work your magic," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never had a slow day," says Johnson. "And I don't plan to start." 
</P>
<P>
 On this afternoon, his ironing board sits in front of the Boys Market at 
Slauson and Vermont. Clipboard in hand, Johnson paces like a carnival barker. 
Experience has shown that you cannot tell a Democrat just by looking at him. So 
he reaches out to everybody. 
</P>
<P>
 "How you doing, sir?" he calls, stepping up to meet a potential Democrat at 
the edge of the parking lot. " Hola, amigo! Registered?" 
</P>
<P>
 Despite his friendly demeanor, some of the people Johnson tackles seem afraid 
of him. "Not a citizen," said one man who ducked his head and hurried by. Other 
people mistakenly think that what Johnson offers is no longer theirs to take. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't vote," said one embarrassed-looking young man -- one of several who 
told Johnson they believed a prior felony conviction prevented them from ever 
voting again. Johnson was quick to correct them. 
</P>
<P>
 "As long as you ain't on parole, you can vote," he said, stopping this young 
man just as he reached the door. The man turned and stared as the words sunk 
in. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't have to pay no money?" he asked, his voice no longer ashamed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Noooo, huh-uh," Johnson said, steering him toward the ironing board. 
</P>
<P>
 This scene played out several times during Johnson's shift. "Penitentiary," 
one young man told him. "Felony," muttered another. When Johnson explained the 
rules -- that as long as you are a U.S. citizen, 18 years old and not in prison 
or on parole, you can vote -- their faces softened as if he had given them a 
gift. 
</P>
<P>
 But ignorance is easier to remedy than apathy. "Ain't none of 'em no good," a 
heavyset woman told Johnson as she breezed by. Politicians, she said, "don't do 
nothing for you." 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, maybe if we got a new person in," Johnson said, "that might change 
things." 
</P>
<P>
 She shook her head. "They're only for the rich, not the poor." 
</P>
<P>
 An older man in a baseball cap, his hands full of groceries, said he had 
already registered. But he had little hope that his vote would make much of a 
difference. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only way it's going to change is if we vote, right?" Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "No," the man said. "Faith in Jesus." 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson flashed a smile. "Well, that too," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For Johnson, registering Democrats is not a mission of ideology. It is a job. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson found that out two months ago, when a man with an ironing board 
persuaded him to register. "I could do that," he said to himself, and when he 
learned that he could earn $320 a week for a few months, he was even more 
enthusiastic. 
</P>
<P>
 He is persistent and charming and possesses an instinctive marketing ability, 
a knack for using what works. 
</P>
<P>
 On this afternoon, he tells the unregistered about the new "three strikes" law 
and reminds young people of Wilson's embrace of the death penalty. ("Wilson's 
the one that's gonna hang you if y'all get in trouble," he says.) During nearly 
five hours on the street, he mentions the name of Democratic challenger 
Kathleen Brown not a single time. 
</P>
<P>
 In all likelihood, only a fraction of the people Johnson registers will 
actually vote Nov. 8. Democrats in general tend not to vote as faithfully as 
Republicans. Both parties are planning aggressive get-out-the-vote efforts to 
boost their numbers. But that is someone else's job. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson spots a woman hurrying to catch a bus. "There's always another bus 
coming," Johnson calls after her. "Here I come now!" he shouts, starting to 
sprint. "I'm going to come to you!" 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe his tenacity impressed her -- or simply wore her down. But Johnson gets 
his way. "Now," he says, handing the woman a receipt, "that didn't take a 
minute, did it?"

BELGIAN FOREIGN MINISTER CLAES PICKED TO HEAD NATO; MILITARY: IF CONFIRMED, HE 
WILL BEGIN A FOUR-YEAR TERM AS THE ALLIANCE WORKS TO CARVE OUT A POST-COLD WAR 
ROLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Ambassadors to the 16-member North Atlantic Treaty Organization on Monday 
selected Belgian Foreign Minister Willy Claes for the alliance's top job of 
secretary general. 
</P>
<P>
 The appointment of Claes, 55, is expected to be confirmed later this week by 
NATO foreign ministers, who are now in New York for the opening of the annual 
session of the U.N. General Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
 The selection, carried out with little public debate or controversy, 
constitutes a badly needed smooth, swift transition for the alliance as it 
searches for new direction in the post-Cold War era. 
</P>
<P>
 Claes succeeds Manfred Woerner, who died Aug. 13 after a long battle with 
cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 Although his name was mentioned among possible successors to Woerner virtually 
from the start, Claes is in many ways an unlikely figure for the job. Unlike 
Woerner, who trained as a jet pilot and spent several years as his country's 
defense minister before coming to NATO, Claes' background is in economics and 
foreign affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, he seems to have shown little interest in military matters. His 
Flemish Socialist Party also actively opposed the controversial alliance 
decision to deploy medium-range cruise nuclear missiles in Belgium in the early 
1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 But diplomats involved in the selection process point to his strengths. "He's 
a good Atlanticist, yet he also favors strengthening the European dimension of 
the alliance," commented one NATO diplomat. "That combination is essential for 
our future." 
</P>
<P>
 As a successful Belgian politician, he has a reputation more as a skilled 
consensus builder and a hard worker than a visionary. He prefers to operate 
with discretion rather than in the limelight. 
</P>
<P>
 Claes won praise for his handling of extremely delicate issues on the agenda 
during Belgium's six-month presidency of the European Union last year. 
</P>
<P>
 He begins his four-year term at a time when the alliance is working to carve 
out a new role in the post-Cold War era. Created in 1949 to counter the Soviet 
threat to Western Europe, NATO is often called the most successful alliance in 
which the United States has ever participated. But with the collapse of the 
Berlin Wall five years ago, NATO's main mission of containing Communist 
expansion effectively ended in victory, placing its own future in doubt. 
</P>
<P>
 Realizing this fact, Woerner quickly started moving the alliance into new 
areas, including peacekeeping outside member countries, and forging meaningful 
ties with its former enemies, including Russia. But these steps remain 
tentative and Claes is likely to be judged on his ability to turn them into 
fixtures that would guarantee the alliance's future. 
</P>
<P>
 More immediately, Claes must try to ease tensions between the United States 
and key European partners on NATO's role in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration has pressed for more extensive use of alliance air 
power to curb Bosnian Serb provocations. 
</P>
<P>
 But European allies -- such as France and Britain, which have forces on the 
ground in Bosnia -- see such a policy as reckless. 
</P>
<P>
 Brussels researcher Isabelle Maelcamp contributed to this report.

ISRAEL QUIETLY OKS WEST BANK EXPANSION, ANGERING PLO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL PARKS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, who halted construction of Israeli settlements 
in the occupied West Bank two years ago, has quietly approved expansion of one 
such community amid indications that others will also be enlarged to secure 
Israel's hold on parts of the territory when Palestinians gain autonomy there. 
</P>
<P>
 Oded Ben-Ami, the prime minister's spokesman, confirmed that Rabin had in 
August authorized the settlement of Alfei Menashe to add nearly 1,000 housing 
units, more than doubling its size. Other officials said this was not a return 
to extensive settlement and should be viewed differently from expansion of 
Jewish settlements deeper in the West Bank. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is on the 'seam,' " Ben-Ami said, referring to Alfei Menashe's position 
about two miles beyond the armistice line that formed the border between Israel 
and Jordan prior to the 1967 Middle East War. The "seam," he said, referred to 
areas about "100 meters or so" across the old border. 
</P>
<P>
 But the independent newspaper Haaretz reported that the government, looking 
toward Israel's eventual withdrawal from most of the West Bank, is planning to 
expand a series of settlements, mostly around Jerusalem and the northern West 
Bank town of Qalqiliya in an effort to hold these crucial areas when the 
territory comes under Palestinian administration. 
</P>
<P>
 These settlements would thus become Israel's front line with the Palestinian 
territories and, in time, the border. Alfei Menashe, which currently has a 
population of about 4,000, is southeast of Qalqiliya, an area where Israel was 
only seven miles wide under the old armistice line with Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
 The Palestine Liberation Organization accused Rabin of reneging on last year's 
peace agreement, and it expressed concern that this was simply the first of the 
settlements to be enlarged. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is very regrettable that Prime Minister Rabin has authorized such an 
expansion of Israeli settlements in the occupied territories," Marwan Kanafani, 
a spokesman for PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat, said in Gaza City. "This violates, 
in letter and spirit, all the agreements that the Palestine Liberation 
Organization and the Palestinian Authority have signed with the Israeli 
government." 
</P>
<P>
 Kanafani also asserted that many Israeli settlements have been expanding for 
the past two years, often seizing additional Palestinian land to do so, despite 
Rabin's orders against new construction. Kanafani said the PLO would raise the 
issue with Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 After taking office in July, 1992, Rabin froze construction of about 10,000 
housing units planned for the occupied territories by the previous right-wing 
Likud government, but he did permit work to continue on 13,700 homes whose 
foundations had been laid. 
</P>
<P>
 That decision helped win Israel important loan guarantees totaling $10 billion 
from the United States, which had described the Jewish settlements as 
"obstacles to peace" and held up the additional assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 Resumption of settlement construction is likely to bring criticism from the 
Clinton Administration.

UPDATE; ATOMIC BOMBING EXHIBIT HAS VETERANS UP IN ARMS; SOME SAY SMITHSONIAN 
DISPLAY WILL IGNORE JAPANESE ATROCITIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF LEEDS, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 During perhaps the most critical moment of the 20th Century, Maj. Thomas W. 
Ferebee peered down from the Enola Gay bomber at a T-shaped bridge. Two minutes 
later, he had changed the world forever. 
</P>
<P>
 A 9,000-pound atomic bomb called "Little Boy" fell out of the sky at 8:15 a.m. 
on Aug. 6, 1945, and leveled the Japanese city of Hiroshima. Tens of thousands 
of lives were simultaneously saved and lost with the flip of a switch, and the 
mushroom cloud that hovered over Hiroshima became the first lasting image of 
the Atomic Age. 
</P>
<P>
 The days and years that followed produced other images, both proud and fearful 
-- a sailor bending his sweetheart in a homecoming kiss, diplomats walking the 
thin line between deterrence and destruction, missile-carrying ships crawling 
first toward Cuba, then away. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, World War II veterans and historians are engaging in a tug-of-war over 
the meaning of those photographic images and hence, over the fabric of history. 
</P>
<P>
 As the Smithsonian Institution prepares to pull the Enola Gay, the legendary 
Air Force B-29 Superfortress that delivered Little Boy, from its resting place 
for an exhibit commemorating the first atomic bombing, decades-old tensions 
over the attack are festering again. 
</P>
<P>
 Aviators and combat veterans say the planned exhibit, titled "The Last Act: 
The Atomic Bomb and the End of World War II," will present an unfair and 
incomplete picture of the war by highlighting the devastation caused by the 
bomb without also portraying atrocities by the Japanese military. Early 
blueprints for the display included far more photos of Japanese victims than 
U.S. casualties. 
</P>
<P>
 Veterans say making the Enola Gay, which has been sitting in a dusty Maryland 
hangar for nearly 50 years, part of such a display would dishonor the warplane. 
</P>
<P>
 Historians at the National Air and Space Museum have insisted that their 
display, which has been re-scripted to pacify critics repeatedly since March, 
will be unbiased. 
</P>
<P>
 Museum Director John Harwit has said the exhibit will present the "naked 
brutality" of the Japanese forces, which tortured POWs and performed biological 
experiments on innocent victims. 
</P>
<P>
 For months, Air Force officials, members of Congress and veterans have been 
negotiating with the exhibit's designers to find some middle ground. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now, the heels are dug in," said Jack Giese, a spokesman for the Air Force 
Assn., a group made up of veterans, active military members and civilian 
supporters. 
</P>
<P>
 Efforts to find a balance in the exhibit have deteriorated into an acerbic 
feud that threatens to produce a result that satisfies no one. The 
5,500-square-foot display, set to open next May, even has spurred infighting 
among museum staff. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the current layout, the exhibit will consist of five areas, each with 
artifacts on display and captions explaining their significance. The first 
area, called "A Fight to the Finish," will focus on combat in the Pacific. It 
features an Ohka Japanese suicide bomber used against U.S. ships. 
</P>
<P>
 The second area recounts how President Harry S. Truman arrived at his decision 
to drop the bomb and includes a replica of the "Fat Man" atomic bomb that razed 
the Japanese city of Nagasaki eight days after the first bomb. 
</P>
<P>
 The forward 60 feet of the Enola Gay's bullet-shaped fuselage will be the 
centerpiece of the third section, "Delivering the Bomb." 
</P>
<P>
 The fourth area, "Ground Zero," is the "emotional center" of the exhibit, 
administrators say. It will include photos of the decimation inflicted on the 
two Japanese targets, the charred remnants of a schoolgirl's meal, a clock 
forever frozen at 8:15 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 "We certainly aren't trying to shock people, but we're going to accurately 
show the destruction on the ground," said Mike Fetters, museum spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 The last area, "The Legacy of Hiroshima and Nagasaki," will revisit the 
immediate post-World War II period, the Cold War and the nuclear arms race. 
</P>
<P>
 Veterans say the display, particularly the post-war section, is geared toward 
politically correct revisionism. 
</P>
<P>
 The exhibit largely ignores the significance of the Japanese attack on Pearl 
Harbor and the Bataan death march, they say -- and by devoting too much space 
to issues such as nuclear proliferation and brinkmanship by the superpowers, 
the museum seems to apologize for U.S. use of the bomb. 
</P>
<P>
 The Air Force Assn. and other groups have demanded the designers re-script the 
display. 
</P>
<P>
 Two dozen members of Congress, distressed by a "lack of context" in the 
display, said in an August letter to Robert M. Adams, secretary of the 
Smithsonian Institution, that the exhibit blueprint is "anti-American" because 
it includes more photographs of Japanese casualties than American casualties. 
</P>
<P>
 And on Friday, the Senate unanimously passed a non-binding resolution urging 
the Smithsonian not to discount the sacrifice of American veterans in its 
exhibit of the Enola Gay. 
</P>
<P>
 To appease critics, exhibit designers have added an anteroom to the main 
gallery with more background information on how the war began. To get to the 
main exhibit, visitors would pass through the anteroom, featuring about 50 
photographs and focused on the ways that Americans experienced the Pacific War, 
both on the battlefield and at home.

SOCIAL ISSUES; CLINTON SURROGATES HIT ROAD TO GET BACKING FOR HOMELESS PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Concerned that the Clinton Administration's high-priority initiative to combat 
homelessness is stuck in a Senate logjam, federal officials are traveling 
across the country to rally support to help push the plan through Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 At President Clinton's urging, Housing and Urban Development Secretary Henry 
G. Cisneros and other officials have embarked on a campaign to persuade the 
public and influential mayors -- including Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan -- 
to urge Congress to act on the bill before adjourning next month. 
</P>
<P>
 Cisneros has a special stake in the plan. He predicted this year that by the 
end of Clinton's current term, HUD homeless programs will have reduced by 
one-third the estimated 60,000 men, women and children living on streets and 
beaches and in parks and shelters each night. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan has broad bipartisan support in Congress. But it is being held up by 
Senate Republicans who are trying to stall virtually all business until after 
the November elections, which they expect will give them more seats in Congress 
and greater clout in shaping legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 The measure would double the amount of federal spending to fight homelessness 
to $1.7 billion in 1995. "If we don't get the money, we're not going to be able 
to reduce homelessness," said Andrew Cuomo, HUD assistant secretary for 
community planning and development, who is on a 10-city tour to drum up support 
for the bill. 
</P>
<P>
 The goal is to revolutionize the way homelessness is addressed, creating a 
federally supported program to push cities to design aggressive plans to tackle 
the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 The new approach was crafted because Administration officials believe the 
problem has become so deeply rooted in society that the piecemeal responses of 
charities and churches are not sufficient and should be augmented by 
coordinated, comprehensive public policy headed by local governments with 
federal guidance and funding. 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles today, Cuomo and Riordan plan a joint pitch along those lines 
as they help launch an expanded program for recovering substance abusers, paid 
for with $2 million of federal funds. The project involves renovating an annex 
of the Russ House on Skid Row. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, the HUD initiative stands to increase federal dollars directed to Los 
Angeles sixfold, to about $65 million. It requires the city to address the 
homelessness problem in a new way, channeling funds to programs that offer 
permanent solutions by treating the complex reasons for homelessness instead of 
just providing food and shelter. 
</P>
<P>
 The department also is challenging the city to come up with a system for 
reaching out to the homeless where they are -- outside the Civic Center or on 
benches in Pershing Square. Those who are mentally ill would be given 
psychological treatment, medication and specially adapted, supportive living 
situations. Those who are substance abusers would be sent to drug and alcohol 
programs. Those without job skills would be directed to training. 
</P>
<P>
 A radical aspect of the program is that the federal government wants to pay 
for performance. Under the Los Angeles plan, the city would be reimbursed for 
each person who is given a long-term alternative to living on the streets. For 
example, the city would be paid for each homeless person who finds a job or is 
placed in long-term housing or a hospital or supportive living situation for 
the mentally ill, or who signs up for drug or alcohol treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 The appropriations bill that includes the federal funds has been approved by 
the House and appears certain to pass in the Senate. The measure that 
authorizes use of those funds for the Administration's new strategy, however, 
is in jeopardy. Although the measure apparently has no strong opposition in the 
Senate, it is being held up along with virtually all other legislation in the 
Republican parliamentary maneuvering. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Conference of Mayors, at its leadership meeting last week in 
Knoxville, Tenn., voiced support for the measure. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of us -- Republican and Democrat, metropolitan city and small town -- 
share the firm commitment to reduce the suffering of homeless children, women 
and men," the organization wrote in a letter to Clinton.

CRISIS IN THE CARIBBEAN; HAITI CLASHES RAISE 'MISSION CREEP' FEAR; MILITARY: 
SOME SAY U.S. POLICE ROLE EXCEEDS OPERATION'S ORIGINAL SCOPE. PENTAGON 
MAINTAINS IT'S ESSENTIAL FOR SUCCESS. 
</P>

<P>
 Is the American military venture in Haiti falling victim to "mission creep" -- 
the kind of unconscious expansion of U.S. troops' basic role in a foreign 
operation that helped turn the intervention in Somalia last year into a 
debacle? 
</P>
<P>
 At first blush, the symptoms appear to be there: The Clinton Administration 
entered Haiti with the assertion that U.S. troops would not become involved in 
day-to-day police operations there. That would be left to the Haitian police. 
</P>
<P>
 Barely a day later, clearly uncomfortable U.S. officials announced that as a 
result of the excessive force being used by the Haitian police, U.S. military 
police would be "overseeing" the Haitians -- and personally intervening if 
necessary to prevent abuses. 
</P>
<P>
 In other words, the U.S. troops would be playing cop after all. 
</P>
<P>
 The prospect of mounting risks for U.S. troops has sent jitters through 
Congress, which still is smarting from the Somalia experience, when a shift in 
the mission -- from ensuring security to hunting down clan leader Mohammed 
Farah Aidid -- sparked a war between Aidid and U.S. forces. 
</P>
<P>
 Those worries were heightened by an incident Saturday when U.S. Marines killed 
10 Haitian policemen after a couple of the Haitians pointed firearms at the 
Americans. The Marines acted well within their rules of engagement, but the 
exchange raised visions of Somali-style violence. 
</P>
<P>
 Alarmed by the seeming mission creep in Haiti, U.S. lawmakers began moving 
Monday to set a firm deadline for withdrawing all American troops from the 
country, with plans to bring legislation to the floor soon. 
</P>
<P>
 And commentators have taken to leveling the charge as a matter of routine. 
"This isn't (just) mission creep -- it's mission leap !" Daniel Schorr, senior 
correspondent for National Public Radio, told his listeners over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week's rhetorical turnabout aside, both the Pentagon and independent 
military analysts deny that the Administration has dangerously expanded the 
military's mission in Haiti and say that America has to serve as a police force 
to make the operation work. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are resisting and we will continue to resist mission creep," Defense 
Secretary William J. Perry told reporters at a briefing Monday afternoon. "We 
will do what is necessary in the exigencies of the moment, (but) we will not 
undertake to perform routine police functions," such as crowd control, which 
the Haitian police still are performing. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert B. Oakley, former President George Bush's special envoy in the first 
(and highly successful) part of the Somalia operation -- who vigorously 
criticized the mission creep that eventually strangled the second phase of the 
U.S. intervention -- agreed with Perry. 
</P>
<P>
 Had the United States actually invaded Haiti under fire, U.S. troops would 
have had to beat back the Haitian military and would have been forced to assume 
all police functions in the country. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wouldn't say that this is mission creep," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Andrew Krepinevich, a former Pentagon strategist now with the Defense Budget 
Project, said that at least part of the military's problem has been the 
takeover accord worked out by former President Jimmy Carter, which requires 
that U.S. troops cooperate with the Haitian police. 
</P>
<P>
 Had U.S. troops had to enter Haiti by force, they would have overturned the 
Haitian police altogether and taken on all police functions by necessity. The 
Carter plan obviated the need for that, but the Haitian cops overstepped their 
bounds. Now, the Americans are back in the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if the mission has not yet been expanded that much, the job still is a 
risky one for the Americans who are on duty in Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 "The dangers would be inherent anyway," said retired Marine Brig. Gen. George 
H. Walls Jr., who dealt with Haitian refugees in 1992. "The potential for 
things that you don't want to happen is there. It was one of the risks that we 
had to assess at the beginning." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Pentagon strategists are not so worried about the current situation as 
they are about the danger of mushrooming unrest -- and possibly some sniping 
against U.S. troops -- beginning next weekend as the Oct. 15 deadline for the 
restoration of the government of ousted President Jean-Bertrand Aristide nears. 
</P>
<P>
 Haitian military leaders already "see their power base eroding," a senior U.S. 
military officer said. "That's going to be the time that we have to pay 
particular attention." 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration is trying to rein in congressional efforts to force 
a quick exit of U.S. forces. Perry warned lawmakers Monday that setting a 
specific withdrawal date would only undermine the mission and jeopardize the 
safety of the expected 15,000 troops in Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 But many senators and House members appeared unconvinced. 
</P>
<P>
 "They didn't say anything I hadn't heard on television the night before," said 
Sen. John McCain of Arizona, a leading GOP critic of the operation. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the Pentagon is scrambling to retain the Haitian police as a buffer 
between U.S. combat troops and Haitian citizens, even if that means coaxing 
previously errant police back to their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Two days after the Marine squad killed the 10 Haitians, U.S. commanders asked 
Haiti's military chief, Lt. Gen. Raoul Cedras, to order the remaining 
policemen, who had scattered, back to their posts.

CRISIS IN THE CARIBBEAN; 221 HAITI REFUGEES COME HOME FROM GUANTANAMO; 
REPATRIATION: GROUP IS THE FIRST TO RETURN SINCE THE AMERICANS LANDED. MANY ARE 
BEWILDERED AND FEARFUL. 
</P>

<P>
 With glum resignation, vague hope and lingering fear, 221 Haitian refugees 
came home Monday afternoon, filing off the U.S. Coast Guard cutter Northland at 
a Port-au-Prince harbor now teeming with U.S. combat forces. 
</P>
<P>
 In a ceremony, U.S. officials called the Haitians' return the first concrete 
demonstration of why America intervened in Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 Clad mostly in T-shirts and shorts or soiled dresses, their belongings tied up 
in plastic garbage bags, the men, women and children who fled Haiti's horrors 
of poverty and violence in rickety boats just months before were the first 
Haitians to voluntarily return from a makeshift camp at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba 
since thousands of U.S. forces entered Haiti a week ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is, in effect, a reverse flow of what we had a couple weeks ago," 
declared U.S. Ambassador William L. Swing, who stood by the cutter's gangplank 
with U.S. forces commander Lt. Gen. Hugh Shelton to welcome the refugees home. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had Haitians leaving in large numbers in unseaworthy boats, and now 
they're coming back." 
</P>
<P>
 Curbing the numbers of Haitian refuge seekers who had filled the Caribbean 
with a precarious flotilla bound for U.S. shores was high among the reasons 
President Clinton used to justify a costly military intervention that already 
has left 10 Haitians dead. 
</P>
<P>
 On the surface, Monday's arrival ceremony appeared to confirm, in what one 
U.S. official here called "an eloquent expression of the dramatic changes in 
the people," how the U.S. presence and the promised return of exiled President 
Jean-Bertrand Aristide can end the U.S.-bound exodus. 
</P>
<P>
 In reality, the group of voluntary repatriates, plucked from the sea just 
months ago by Coast Guard patrols, were part of a weeks-old program to convince 
the 14,000 Haitians still at the U.S. naval base at Guantanamo Bay that it is 
better to come home than to live in limbo. And already, U.S. officials said, 
5,783 Haitians have done so voluntarily on Coast Guard vessels like the 
Northland since July 25. The last such arrival was 19 days ago. 
</P>
<P>
 But timing was everything on Monday. Ambassador Swing said the group's arrival 
-- the first under the watchful guard of dozens of U.S. soldiers in full battle 
gear -- was a demonstration that security in the country has improved 
sufficiently to entice the rest back in what he predicted will be a rapidly 
escalating program. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel this is the time to start moving the refugees back, at least the ones 
who come voluntarily," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The refugees themselves were not so certain. For most, the homecoming from a 
painful journey that ended where it had begun was clouded with uncertainty. 
None had abandoned the dream of reaching U.S. soil someday, but most said they 
agreed to return largely because they were resigned to the impossibility of 
ever reaching it from Guantanamo Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 All said they were joyous over America's military presence here, but they were 
equally unanimous in expressing what U.S. officials on the scene described as 
"a natural apprehension" about what awaits them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm worried about just getting home from here," said Ansell Marcelus, 33, who 
was among a group of 36 people from the northern town of Port-de-Paix who left 
together July 5 and returned together Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Port-de-Paix is still run by army and the (Tontons) Macoutes, the terrorist 
army that made us run away in the first place. Yes, I came back because the 
Americans are here with us. And I can see they have a lot of security right 
here. But you know the Macoutes. We were hoping the American soldiers would 
escort us to Port-de-Paix and protect us when we get there." 
</P>
<P>
 They didn't. The U.S. Army escorted the returnees in army trucks and buses 
only as far as the Port-au-Prince bus station, an open sewer of mud and garbage 
a few blocks from the port. From there, equipped only with the equivalent of 
$15 that the U.S. government provides each voluntary returnee through the Red 
Cross, the 221 repatriates had to find their own way home with the small 
bundles that were the last of their personal possessions. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't even know where I'll sleep tonight, let alone how I'm going to get 
home -- or what I'll find when I get there now," said Milina Marty, who had 
fled the troubled northern town of Cap Haitien on June 19 in a tiny skiff with 
her three sons. 
</P>
<P>
 Marty and her family will have the benefit of the U.S. presence when they do 
get home. But Cap Haitien was the site of Saturday night's fatal shooting of 10 
Haitian policemen by the U.S. Marines who occupy the town. Marty said she was 
well-aware of how chaos spread through the town when the Haitian forces fled 
after the incident. What she didn't know is whether, when she gets there, she 
will be happy she came home. 
</P>
<P>
 When Marty was asked why she voluntarily abandoned the Guantanamo camp, she 
smiled wryly. "They threw me away," she said. "What choice did we have? It was 
either the camp in Cuba or this -- back home." 
</P>
<P>
 Joseph Camilien agreed. A fisherman who, like his fellow returnees, had 
crowded into a shabby, ancient sailboat several months ago only to be picked up 
by the Coast Guard the following day, Camilien said he, too, felt he had no 
choice but to come home. 
</P>
<P>
 "I couldn't live in that camp another day," he said. "There was nowhere to 
work, nowhere to really live. And they told us we weren't going anywhere else. 
</P>
<P>
 "But now I have no idea what I'll do. I wanted very much to go to America. And 
of course, I still want to go. But this is the right way to do it, come home 
first and see what happens tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
 Rita Petit-Frere was perhaps the glummest of the group as she struggled to 
carry both her bundle and her new baby. The 23-year-old had left Haiti seven 
months pregnant in June, praying her son would be born an American. She gave 
birth 26 days ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "The country is changing," she said with little enthusiasm when asked why she 
and her husband decided to come home voluntarily. 
</P>
<P>
 "Changing for the better?" she was asked. 
</P>
<P>
 She looked down at the newborn son in her arms and shook her head. 
</P>
<P>
 "No," she said as soldiers and Red Cross workers guided her to a waiting bus. 
"But we're home now all the same."

 Security forces Monday killed a Muslim extremist with a $70,000 price on his

 A government communique said Cherif Gousmi, 26, was slain in a gun battle in

NEW PLAN TO LIFT BOSNIA ARMS EMBARGO STUDIED; BALKANS: COMPROMISE BEING WORKED 
ON AT U.N. WOULD PERMIT SHIPMENTS TO MUSLIM-LED GOVERNMENT FORCES EARLY IN 
1995. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 U.S. officials, Bosnian leaders and other allies conferred Monday on a new 
proposal to break the stalemate over the Bosnia arms embargo and abruptly shift 
the balance of power in the three-year civil war. 
</P>
<P>
 Convening at the United Nations for several days of meetings, top officials 
are debating a compromise to lift the embargo and permit weapons shipments to 
the Muslim-led Bosnian army -- thus letting it come closer to matching the 
firepower of its Bosnian Serb adversaries -- but not until early next year. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal, first aired by Bosnian officials last month, has apparently 
softened the opposition of British and French officials who have threatened to 
pull their troops out of the U.N. peacekeeping mission in Bosnia-Herzegovina if 
the arms embargo is lifted. 
</P>
<P>
 They would withdraw their forces out of a concern that a resolution allowing 
arms to Bosnia might provoke an all-out Bosnian Serb offensive that would 
endanger their troops. The proposed delay would allow the allies to find safer 
positions for their troops or withdraw them entirely. 
</P>
<P>
 The delay also may weaken Russian opposition to lifting the embargo. Madeleine 
Albright, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, said Monday that she 
believes "that as the situation evolves, they may, in fact, see some value" in 
such a move. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, an agreement would enable the United States to sidestep a 
fast-approaching Oct. 15 deadline for action on the issue. President Clinton 
has promised to urge the U.N. Security Council to end the embargo if the 
Bosnian Serbs do not agree by that date to a peace plan advanced by the United 
States, Russia, Britain, France and Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 The President also has promised to consult Congress on possibly lifting the 
embargo unilaterally if the Security Council doesn't go along. So far, the 
Bosnian Serbs have rejected the peace plan. The Bosnian government has accepted 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 Ending the embargo next month poses serious risks. It could escalate the war 
swiftly, possibly spilling it over into neighboring countries, and it would 
probably draw the United States into acting as a military sponsor for the 
Bosnians. 
</P>
<P>
 There has been speculation that the Bosnian Muslims fear lifting the ban 
immediately would lead to the swift evacuation of U.N. troops and an all-out 
attack by the Serbs on the Muslims. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked at a news conference what would induce the Serbs to hold off such an 
offensive if the embargo was lifted next year instead, Bosnian Ambassador 
Muhamed Sacirbey said that "we have reasons to expect" that the United Nations 
now would heed Clinton's demand that it call more air strikes against the Serbs 
and expand the number of zones that exclude Serbian heavy weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 Lifting the embargo would also mean that the United States "would have some 
real responsibility to arm and equip" the Bosnian Muslims, said one U.S. 
official. 
</P>
<P>
 The compromise would avoid those difficulties, at least for a time. It also 
would allow more time for the developing split between the Bosnian Serbs and 
their allies in Serbia to mature, and it would enable the United States and its 
allies to look for other ways to pressure the Bosnian Serbs to accept the 
partition formula of the international peace plan. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, it could also demonstrate to the Serbs that the allies 
remain reluctant to lift the embargo. 
</P>
<P>
 The developments came as Clinton delivered an annual U.N. address in which he 
appealed to the General Assembly to end the growing "strangulation" of besieged 
Sarajevo, the Bosnian capital, and urged the use of NATO warplanes to get the 
job done. 
</P>
<P>
 In a speech that resonated with his growing frustration, Clinton warned that 
after a period of improvement, conditions around Sarajevo have "once again 
deteriorated substantially." 
</P>
<P>
 "A new resolve by the United Nations to enforce its resolutions is now 
necessary to save Sarajevo," he said. "NATO stands ready to act." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton also used his speech to explain a foreign policy that even many allies 
in the U.N. audience have found erratic. In unusually brief remarks, the 
President pointed to recent U.S. interventions -- notably Haiti -- to try to 
calm fears raised in last year's speech that the United States was turning 
decisively away from international involvements. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton sought to minimize the differences with his allies in his 25-minute 
address, as he reviewed U.S. interventions over the past year. He cited Haiti 
to show that the United States will risk its blood and money when its criteria 
for peacekeeping missions are met. 
</P>
<P>
 In a clear appeal for more international support of the U.S. action in Haiti, 
Clinton said that in the Caribbean nation "the United States has demonstrated 
that it would lead a multinational force when our interests are plain, when the 
cause is right, when the mission is achievable and the nations of the world 
stand with us." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton made no mention of the risks of the intervention. Nor did he comment 
on the weekend shootout in Cap Haitien that left 10 Haitians dead and brought 
civil chaos to the northern city. Instead, he pledged confidently that 
ultimately "essential civil order will be restored. Human rights violations 
will be curbed. . . . The military leaders will step down. Democracy will be 
restored."

HIGH COURT TO CONSIDER REVERSING FEDERAL AFFIRMATIVE ACTION RULES; JUDICIARY: 
THE JUSTICES AGREE TO HEAR A CASE CHALLENGING THE PREFERENCES GIVEN TO 
MINORITIES WHEN COMPETING FOR U.S. CONTRACTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The Supreme Court, plunging back into the controversy over affirmative action, 
announced Monday it would consider barring the government from giving an edge 
to blacks and Latinos in competing for federal contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 In a separate case, the court also said it would decide whether to revive a 
California welfare regulation that treats all people living in a household as 
one unit for welfare purposes. That approach, which was invalidated by a judge 
two years ago, could save the state as much as $10 million a year in welfare 
costs, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 In a brief order issued late Monday, the court agreed to hear an appeal that 
broadly challenges the use of affirmative action in federal contracts. The 
case, which likely will be argued before the court in January, could yield a 
ruling that cuts across scores of government programs. For the past four years, 
the court has uneasily tolerated a double standard for handing out government 
contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 States and municipalities may not reserve contracts for racial and ethnic 
minorities, except to remedy past discrimination, the court said on a 5-4 vote 
in 1989. Such blatant racial preferences violate the "equal protection" rights 
of whites, the justices said in Croson vs. Richmond. 
</P>
<P>
 However, on a separate 5-4 vote a year later, the court said in Metro 
Broadcasting vs. the FCC that federal agencies acting at the behest of Congress 
may give preferences to minorities and women. 
</P>
<P>
 That dual approach may be nearing an end. Four liberal justices who helped 
form the majority in the broadcasting case have left the court, and the five 
conservative justices have spoken out against the continued use of federal 
contract preferences for minorities and women. They are Chief Justice William 
H. Rehnquist and Justices Antonin Scalia, Clarence Thomas, Anthony M. Kennedy 
and Sandra Day O'Connor. 
</P>
<P>
 The court said Monday it would hear the case of Adarand Constructors vs. 
Federico Pena, 93-1841. 
</P>
<P>
 "This case offers them a chance to do a lot of things, including setting the 
same standard of review" for federal and state contracts, said Todd Welch, a 
Denver attorney who represents a white construction company owner who submitted 
the lowest bid but nonetheless lost a federal highway contract to the Gonzales 
Construction Co., a small minority-owned firm. 
</P>
<P>
 The white contractor sued and contended this sort of blatant race 
discrimination violates the Constitution. But two federal courts in Colorado 
ruled that the U.S. Department of Transportation is free to give such 
preferences. 
</P>
<P>
 In their appeal, the lawyers for the white contractor said that "race-based" 
contracts should be be barred, except when they are needed "to remedy prior 
state-sponsored discrimination." 
</P>
<P>
 The case was one of eight granted a review during the court term, which 
officially begins next week. By long tradition, the court announces its first 
orders on its opening day, the first Monday of October. However, this year the 
justices have found themselves in the embarrassing spot of not having granted 
enough cases during the spring to fill up their argument schedule through 
December. 
</P>
<P>
 This week, the justices met to review 1,700 appeals that piled up over the 
summer. Rather than wait until next week, they decided to announce in advance 
that they would hear several cases so that lawyers will have an extra week to 
prepare for arguments in December or January. 
</P>
<P>
 The California welfare case challenges a longstanding state policy that treats 
all persons living in a house as "one assistance unit," even if some of those 
people are not part of the immediate family. 
</P>
<P>
 Other states permit a "needy caretaker" to obtain a separate grant to raise 
other children, such as a niece. In such instances, the combined assistance 
usually is greater than for a household defined as "one assistance unit." 
</P>
<P>
 While California's approach is less costly, a U.S. district judge in 
Sacramento said it violates federal law. The justices agreed to hear the 
state's appeal in Anderson vs. Edwards, 93-1883.

OUTBREAK OF PLAGUE IS NOW UNDER CONTROL, INDIA SAYS; HEALTH: EPIDEMIC HAS 
KILLED 41 IN WESTERN CITY, CAUSED MASS EXODUS. SOME FEAR SPREAD OF DISEASE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Health officials reported Monday that India's first outbreak of plague in 
nearly three decades is firmly under control, but they were still hunting 
carriers of the deadly bacillus who, they said, had become as dangerous as 
"human bombs." 
</P>
<P>
 As of Monday, 41 deaths from pneumonic plague had been registered in the 
western city of Surat near the Arabian Sea coast, and 453 cases of the highly 
contagious disease were suspected in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The officials called those numbers encouraging proof that the spread of the 
dreaded illness, which has already killed 12 million Indians this century, had 
been checked. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is down. It is under control," said Dr. N. J. Kar, chief medical officer 
at the National Institute of Communicable Diseases in New Delhi. 
</P>
<P>
 No new deaths had been reported in the previous 24 hours, officials of the 
Health Ministry said Monday. Health Secretary M. S. Dayal had already given 
assurances that "there is going to be no large-scale outbreak." 
</P>
<P>
 But others feared that the panicky exodus that had led to the outflow of up to 
400,000 of Surat's 2 million people since the epidemic was announced Thursday 
could spread the plague to the rest of India. Anyone carrying the bacterium 
might transmit it through a cough or sputum, medical officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dayal and other Indian government officials flatly denied that any cases had 
been registered so far outside Surat, saying tests of all suspected victims had 
proven negative. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Press Trust of India news agency reported Monday that in Dhule, 120 
miles east of Surat, a man who had fled the epidemic and was being treated for 
plague had died. 
</P>
<P>
 In Rajkot, 150 miles northwest of Surat, one of several hundred people 
receiving treatment for plague-like symptoms died in a hospital, the agency 
said. In Ahmedabad, 120 miles north of Surat, six patients with similar 
symptoms were being kept in isolation. 
</P>
<P>
 In Bombay, 160 miles south of Surat, local health authorities quarantined 21 
suspected plague victims in an isolation ward, United News of India said. 
Twelve were from Surat. 
</P>
<P>
 Pneumonic plague is one of the three forms of the feared pestilence known in 
the Middle Ages as the "Black Death." In the 14th Century, plague killed an 
estimated 25 million people, or one-quarter the population of Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 Plague is spread to humans by fleas that have bitten rats infected with the 
bacillus Pasteurella pestis . In its pneumonic form, the infection leads to 
high fever, the vomiting of blood and the filling of the lungs with fluid. 
Death occurs within three to four days. 
</P>
<P>
 India's last plague cases were registered in 1966, Kar said. Surat residents 
blamed their leaders for the resurgence of the disease. 
</P>
<P>
 "Municipal authorities allowed the garbage to pile up in the city after the 
recent monsoon floods," said Pradip Saroi, who escaped over the weekend by 
taking the train to New Delhi. "They did not take any preventive measures, nor 
was DDT sprayed." 
</P>
<P>
 The precise toll may never be known, since people in Surat's poorer 
neighborhoods are believed to have cremated suspected plague victims without 
reporting their deaths. At least 93 people died this month while undergoing 
treatment for symptoms of malaria, dengue fever, typhoid and cholera. Doctors 
said many of those deaths may have been caused by plague. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite its macabre reputation, plague can be cured if a victim is rapidly 
given antibiotics. Over the weekend, 1,200 members of a medical "strike force" 
handed out 1.2 million tablets of tetracycline in Surat as officials rushed in 
millions of additional doses. 
</P>
<P>
 Around the Civil Hospital, paramilitary troops were deployed to prevent the 
hundreds who had been hospitalized from leaving. According to Dayal, 57 people 
fled the hospital during the first two days of the epidemic when they saw other 
people die. 
</P>
<P>
 A senior Health Ministry official called the infected escapees "human bombs," 
and police sent teams into infected neighborhoods to track them down. 
</P>
<P>
 The plague returned to India for the first time in 28 years when a village in 
the Beed district of the neighboring state of Maharashtra reported its first 
case of bubonic plague last month. The outbreak was blamed on a surge in the 
rat population drawn by relief food meant to help victims of last year's 
destructive earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 90 people were infected, but the bubonic outbreak was brought under 
control by insecticide spraying and antibiotics. 
</P>
<P>
 Bubonic plague constitutes about three-quarters of all plague cases, and it is 
less infectious and often milder in its symptoms than the pneumonic variety. 
</P>
<P>
 Other nations took steps to guard against spread of the plague, and the United 
States, Russia and Japan offered to help fight the disease. U.S. officials were 
reported monitoring airports to watch for passengers arriving with the plague. 
Hong Kong, Pakistan, South Korea, Thailand and the United Arab Emirates said 
they would examine travelers from India.

PAIR WHO LEFT CHILDREN FOR 16 DAYS CHARGED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A couple who vanished for more than two weeks, leaving their four children 
with an eighth-grade baby-sitter who used her wits and her own money to care 
for them, turned up Monday and were charged with child endangerment. 
</P>
<P>
 Bonnie Railing and James Fignar originally had said they would be gone only 
three days, and offered no public explanation for their 16-day absence.Fignar's 
employer said he was working in New Jersey until Saturday installing floor 
coverings. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple were arrested when they appeared at a custody hearing for the 
children, ages 2 to 10. 
</P>
<P>
 The sitter, 14-year-old Angela Morris, tried to maintain the household, 
enlisting the help of friends, skipping school and keeping the secret from 
authorities, hoping to keep the children out of foster homes. 
</P>
<P>
 The gas had been shut off at the house, so the teen-ager improvised to feed 
and bathe the youngsters, at one point heating bath water in an electric coffee 
maker. 
</P>
<P>
 Police acting on an anonymous tip came to the house Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Their parents were arraigned on four counts each of endangering the welfare of 
a child. Bond was set at $10,000 for Railing and $15,000 for Fignar, and both 
were being held in Allegheny County Jail. 
</P>
<P>
 Family Court Judge Joseph Jaffe ruled Monday that the children must remain in 
foster care at least until another hearing Oct. 5. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple learned about the hearing from the children's grandmother, who said 
she tried to gain custody of the children last week. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple had no comment as they left the custody hearing.

MITCHELL LEAVING WITH A SMILE, UNMET GOAL; POLITICS: MAJORITY LEADER SAYS HE 
DOESN'T REGRET DECISION TO RETIRE. BUT FRIENDS SAY HE IS CRUSHED BY FAILURE TO 
PASS HEALTH CARE REFORM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Long before President Clinton and his wife began barnstorming across America 
to promote health care reform, George J. Mitchell was already toiling in the 
vineyards, holding public hearings and proselytizing at every turn in his 
studious, pedantic manner. 
</P>
<P>
 He even had his own plan, called Health America. But the Senate majority 
leader's efforts in 1991 were soon overshadowed by the presidential campaign 
and the bazaar of reform proposals advanced by the major candidates, and then 
by Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Mitchell persisted, playing a low-key, behind-the-scenes role, 
constantly probing for common ground where others saw no opening. He felt so 
strongly about seeing the issue through that he even passed up an opportunity 
to be named to the Supreme Court last spring. 
</P>
<P>
 And in the waning days of this Congress, it was Mitchell's relentless, 
tortoise-like approach on which the last strand of hope for health care reform 
hung. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was not to be. 
</P>
<P>
 When the end came, it was again Mitchell, alone at center stage, belatedly 
acknowledging what most everyone already had taken for granted: Health care 
reform is dead this year. 
</P>
<P>
 For others, including the Clintons, there will be another day. But not for 
Mitchell. 
</P>
<P>
 After 15 years in the Senate, including five as majority leader, the Maine 
Democrat is happily calling it quits. In an otherwise somber press conference, 
Mitchell, 61, broke into a grin when asked if he is sorry to be leaving. "No, I 
don't regret my decision not to seek reelection . . . . I think I made the 
right decision on the circumstances that existed at the time." 
</P>
<P>
 But behind that facade, friends and confidants said, Mitchell is crushed by 
the failure of Congress to pass comprehensive health care reform. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's got to be hell . . . for him," said Sen. John D. (Jay) Rockefeller IV 
(D-W.Va.), an ally in the health care efforts. "It makes you marvel at the ache 
and the agony that must be under this remarkable, consistent, reasonably 
amiable . . . human being." 
</P>
<P>
 But Mitchell never had any illusions about the daunting task that he 
championed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Reforming the health care system will be difficult. A perfect solution 
doesn't exist," he acknowledged in an interview in December, 1991, as he 
traveled across the country for a series of public hearings on health care 
reform. 
</P>
<P>
 "It turns out I was right," Mitchell said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 What Mitchell -- and the White House -- have learned is that America may be a 
nation of nervous nellies when it comes to the prospect of losing coverage and 
being squeezed by medical inflation. But even the endless stream of scare 
stories that reformers brought before the public weren't enough to galvanize 
the middle class into support for their programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell said he realized that his work had gone for naught during a White 
House meeting last week when Republican congressional leaders threatened to 
hold up approval of a trade agreement if he persisted on health reform. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell conveyed his assessment to Clinton on Friday. "He listened and 
graciously responded," Mitchell said, adding that both the Clintons deserve 
"enormous credit" for their efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell exited with this prediction: "I believe it inevitable that 
comprehensive health care reform will be enacted . . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 But for now, "I'm disappointed, of course."

GOTTI ACCUSER SENTENCED TO FIVE YEARS IN PLEA DEAL; MAFIA: SALVATORE GRAVANO IS 
REWARDED FOR TESTIFYING AGAINST THE NOTORIOUS GAMBINO FAMILY BOSS AND OTHER 
ORGANIZED CRIME FIGURES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Salvatore (Sammy the Bull) Gravano, described by prosecutors as "the most 
significant witness in the history of organized crime in the United States" and 
whose testimony played a decisive role in incarcerating Mafia chieftain John 
Gotti for life, was sentenced Monday to five years in prison -- even though he 
was implicated in 19 murders. 
</P>
<P>
 The sentence imposed by federal Judge I. Leo Glasser, who presided at Gotti's 
trial in 1992 for racketeering and murder, means that counting time already 
served and credit for good behavior Gravano could be free in five months. He 
will remain in the federal witness protection program. 
</P>
<P>
 "There has never been so important a defendant in organized crime who has made 
the leap from one social planet to another," Glasser said before imposing 
sentence. "His stature in organized crime is so unique. His unprecedented 
decision to cooperate encouraged others to cooperate." 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors and federal agents urged a highly lenient sentence for Gravano, 
who not only helped destroy the nation's best-known organized crime boss, but 
whose testimony at six subsequent trials helped convict 36 other Mafia figures. 
His cooperation is continuing, prosecutors said, and he has created a "domino 
effect" of other informants coming forth. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has rendered extraordinary, unprecedented, historic assistance to the 
government," Assistant U.S. Atty. John Gleeson, a key member of the team that 
prosecuted Gotti, told Glasser in federal court in Brooklyn. 
</P>
<P>
 "Gravano has been the most significant witness in the history of organized 
crime in the United States. Part of the reason he has been so valuable is the 
position he occupied before he chose to cooperate," Gleeson and other 
prosecutors said in a memorandum they submitted to the judge. "As the under 
boss of the Gambino Family of La Cosa Nostra, Gravano participated in or 
otherwise obtained knowledge of a truly astounding array of criminal activity. 
</P>
<P>
 "Simply put, Gravano's cooperation has been the signal event in the 
government's decades-long fight against the Mafia." 
</P>
<P>
 When he decided to turn government witness, Gravano -- who was indicted with 
Gotti -- was spirited at night from his cell to a safehouse. He pleaded guilty 
to racketeering charges that could have carried a maximum term of 20 years in 
prison and a $250,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
 When he first approached the government about a deal, prosecutors were fearful 
it was a trap. But the conscientiousness of his cooperation and the quality of 
the information he provided quickly erased any doubts. 
</P>
<P>
 Gravano's defection was a devastating blow for Gotti, who had escaped 
conviction at three previous trials, earning a reputation as the "Teflon Don." 
After Gravano's testimony, Gotti was found guilty of five murders -- including 
masterminding the assassination of his predecessor, Paul Castellano, as head of 
the Gambino crime family, the most important of New York City's five Mafia 
organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 In riveting testimony, Gravano told of sitting in a car in mid-town Manhattan 
with Gotti as a team of hit men gunned down Castellano and an associate. Gotti 
and Gravano then drove slowly past their bloody bodies on the street. 
</P>
<P>
 Gleeson told Glasser that Gravano's testimony was so helpful that prosecutors, 
who earlier had introduced tape recordings of Gotti discussing major crimes, 
made a key decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "When Salvatore Gravano got off the stand, it was the prosecution team's 
judgment we should end the trial quickly because he was such an effective 
witness," Gleeson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The government said in its memorandum: "Gravano was of such a stature in that 
environment that his decision to cooperate has caused some members of organized 
crime to believe that there must be something wrong with the Mafia. 
</P>
<P>
 " . . . The list of defectors from organized crime since November, 1991, when 
Gravano began cooperating, is striking: In the Colombo Family alone, 10 people, 
including the consigliere and two captains, have cooperated; there are three 
significant new witnesses from the Luchese Family, including its under boss. 
Many of these witnesses had known Gravano personally, and his defection to the 
government helped to pave the way for their decision to cooperate." 
</P>
<P>
 Gravano, 49, earned his nickname because of his compact, muscular stature and 
his considerable ability with his fists. 
</P>
<P>
 Gravano, dressed conservatively in a dark suit, had little to say during his 
sentencing. He declined to address Glasser. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge said that while Gravano was accused of 19 murders, he had only 
actually committed one killing. Glasser said that Gravano would face the risk 
of retribution by the mob for the rest of his life.

SUSPECT DENIES GUILT IN DEATH OF WOMAN FOUND IN FREEZER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A handyman accused of killing a young Newport Beach woman and keeping her nude 
body in a freezer for three years pleaded not guilty Monday to the charges 
against him, including allegations that could make him subject to the death 
penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 John J. Famalaro stood behind a glass courtroom partition during the brief 
hearing in Harbor Municipal Court as his lawyer entered a plea of not guilty to 
charges of murder and kidnaping. 
</P>
<P>
 Municipal Judge Craig E. Robison scheduled a preliminary hearing for Oct. 17 
to determine if there is sufficient evidence to order the 37-year-old former 
Lake Forest man bound over for trial in Superior Court for the murder of Denise 
Huber, whose baffling disappearance in 1991 sparked a massive search that made 
her name a household word in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 The district attorney's office, however, could circumvent the public hearing 
process by obtaining a grand jury indictment, which would preclude the need for 
a preliminary hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Christopher J. Evans would not comment on the possibility 
that a grand jury indictment would be sought. Deputy Public Defender Brian 
Ducker, one of two lawyers representing Famalaro, said he had been notified 
that the district attorney might use the grand jury, but did not know for sure 
if that would happen. 
</P>
<P>
 Famalaro has been held without bail in protective custody in the Orange County 
Jail since his extradition earlier this month from Arizona, where he was living 
when Huber's body was discovered in a freezer that Famalaro kept running in a 
rental truck parked in the driveway of his Prescott Country Club home.

JUDGE REJECTS FORMER SEN. HILL'S BID TO REMAIN FREE ON BAIL PENDING APPEAL 
</P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A federal judge Monday denied former state Sen. Frank Hill's request to remain 
free on bail pending the appeal of his conviction for taking a $2,500 payoff 
from an FBI undercover agent. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. District Judge Edward Garcia ordered Hill, 40, to surrender to federal 
authorities by Oct. 12.Hill's attorneys argued that the former lawmaker's 
conviction should be reversed because he was set up by a key witness seeking 
leniency from the prosecution. But Garcia disagreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am not convinced that the appeal is not for the purpose of delay," Garcia 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill was sentenced Sept. 12 to 46 months in prison and fined $2,650. He was 
convicted June 16 of extortion, conspiracy and money laundering in connection 
with the payoff.

LEGISLATION INSPIRED BY SIMPSON CASE SIGNED; GOVERNMENT: BILLS CURB SALE OF 
STORIES BY JURORS AND WITNESSES. WILSON ALSO ENACTS STIFFER DOMESTIC VIOLENCE 
LAWS.

<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson on Monday signed bills spawned by the O.J. Simpson double 
murder case that make it illegal for witnesses and jurors in criminal trials to 
sell their stories until the case is finished. 
</P>
<P>
 At a ceremony staged to coincide with the start of jury selection in the 
Simpson case, Wilson also signed several bills aimed at cracking down on repeat 
perpetrators of domestic violence. 
</P>
<P>
 The governor said the immense publicity surrounding the Simpson case 
demonstrates that the legal system has become a "clearinghouse for hearsay, 
idle gossip and rumor-mongering about the lifestyles of the rich and famous." 
</P>
<P>
 He said his signature on the two trial publicity bills would "ensure that 
witnesses and jurors are a force for justice, not fodder for tabloids, and that 
attorneys will represent their client, not lead a media circus." 
</P>
<P>
 Under the legislation, AB 501 by Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San 
Francisco) and SB 1999 by Sen. Quentin Kopp (I-San Francisco), it will be a 
crime starting Jan. 1 for jurors, witnesses or potential witnesses to provide 
information for compensation, a practice known as "checkbook journalism." 
</P>
<P>
 Kopp and Brown contended that the sale of information contaminates the right 
to a fair trial by providing an incentive to lie. They also said a compensated 
witness may lose credibility in the eyes of a jury, even if he or she tells the 
truth. 
</P>
<P>
 The legislation was introduced in the wake of reports during the summer that 
the tabloid media had offered some witnesses thousands of dollars for their 
stories. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the new law, witnesses will be prohibited from accepting compensation 
for one year from the time a criminal act has occurred or until a final court 
judgment has been made. Jurors will be barred from engaging in any arrangements 
for compensation until 90 days after being discharged. 
</P>
<P>
 Violations are misdemeanors and can result in a jail term of six months. 
Additionally, witnesses who take money can be fined up to three times the 
amount of compensation they received. Jurors are subject to a $1,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown and Kopp argued that their bills were narrowly drawn to avoid violating 
constitutional rights to free speech, free press and fair trial. They said, for 
example, that witnesses to a crime can still provide information to news 
reporters, but they cannot be paid. 
</P>
<P>
 But the American Civil Liberties Union, which opposed the measures, argued 
that the interests of assuring a fair trial and protecting the credibility of 
witnesses could be met by less restrictive alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
 "Imagine the results if this statute had been in effect when the Rodney King 
beating tape was sold to the news media," the ACLU argued as the legislation 
neared final passage last month. 
</P>
<P>
 As a backdrop for signing the domestic violence legislation, Wilson chose a 
center for battered women in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 Under a pair of bills, SB 739 by Sen. Marian Bergeson (R-Newport Beach) and SB 
18X by Sen. Lucy Killea (I-San Diego), the maximum term for repeated spousal or 
cohabitant abuse will be increased to five years from four. Also, the fine will 
be increased to $10,000 from $6,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The governor also signed a bill by Sen. Gary K. Hart (D-Santa Barbara), SB 
1278, which authorizes judges to seize the guns of those under a domestic 
violence restraining order. Another bill, AB 3034 by Assemblywoman Hilda Solis 
(D-El Monte), establishes a registry in the Department of Justice to keep track 
of protective restraining orders. 
</P>
<P>
 Kathleen Brown, Wilson's Democratic opponent, accused the governor of using 
the Simpson case and the attention focused on domestic violence to call 
attention to himself. 
</P>
<P>
 "The truth is that Pete Wilson is trying to cover up his own failed record on 
domestic violence," Brown said in a statement. "Under Pete Wilson, there are 
more shelters for abused dogs than for battered women."

IRVINE HEIR RISKS INHERITANCE LOSS TO WED; SOCIETY: SON OF O.C. MILLIONAIRE 
JOAN IRVINE SMITH DEFIES MOTHER TO MARRY COLLEGE SWEETHEART. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Forced to choose between his millionaire mom and college sweetheart, the 
youngest son of Orange County scion Joan Irvine Smith picked love over money 
earlier this month, marrying a woman his family disapproved of despite threats 
he would be disowned. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a choice that could cost him an inheritance of as much as $100 million 
-- but spared him his dignity, Morton Smith said. It also has pitted him 
against one of Orange County's wealthiest and most visible philanthropists. 
</P>
<P>
 And this week, the delicate details of the Huntington Beach wedding -- which 
Smith's parents and two brothers missed -- were spread across a full page of 
the National Enquirer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think anybody should have to be forced to choose between individuals 
and their family," the younger Smith said in an interview Monday, recounting 
his mother's warnings that if he married Marianne Campbell -- an 
independent-minded nurse with working-class roots -- he would be "out of the 
family." 
</P>
<P>
 "I always felt that people who didn't take a chance on something they believed 
in were losers," added the 29-year-old securities broker, who settled in 
Huntington Beach with his bride this week after returning from a honeymoon in 
western Canada. "I did the right thing as far as my heart told me." 
</P>
<P>
 The elder Smith, 61, granddaughter of the man who once owned much of Orange 
County, refused interviews Monday because she was ill. Through her attorney, 
Russ Allen, she declined comment on whether Morton had been removed from her 
will. 
</P>
<P>
 "I could not encourage this marriage," said the renowned art maven and 
horsewoman in a statement provided by her attorney. "And I fear that it may 
provide a continuing cause of estrangement of Morton from the rest of our 
family." 
</P>
<P>
 Joan Irvine Smith has given millions to UC Irvine, and recently opened her own 
museum displaying California Impressionist paintings. Each spring, she plays 
host to the Oaks Classic, a horse-jumping competition and charity fund-raiser 
at her San Juan Capistrano ranch. Several years ago, she successfully sued the 
Irvine Co. for some $250 million, landing her family among Forbes' magazine's 
400 richest in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Morton Smith and others have estimated his mother's fortune at about $500 
million. Allen would not comment Monday on the provisions of his client's will 
or how she might divide her wealth among her three children and charity. 
</P>
<P>
 Campbell, 30, a pediatric oncology nurse at Long Beach Memorial Medical 
Center, said she is most saddened by the broken relationships. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a shame because they have a wonderful family, an incredible legacy," she 
said. "Mrs. Smith is brilliant -- I just wish she could be more of a mom to 
him. I think sometimes she tries to control people. She can't control me 
because I can't be bought. I won't be. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do not want any bit of their inheritance, I have my own life," she added. 
"To deny your son -- I can't think of anything more tragic than that." 
</P>
<P>
 The newlyweds both said Monday they hope the rift is reconcilable. 
</P>
<P>
 Looking forward to a Christmas reunited with his family, Smith said: "I don't 
even care if I don't get a present, I'd just like a slice of turkey and I'd 
like to sit at the table." 
</P>
<P>
 After a 10-year courtship that began in college, Morton and Marianne met at 
the altar at St. Mary's Church in Huntington Beach Sept. 16, followed by a 
sunset reception on the beach at Irvine Cove attended by some 100 guests. 
</P>
<P>
 Joan Irvine Smith was absent. She said she never got an invitation, though the 
young couple said they sent one. Also skipping the nuptials were Morton's 
father, Morton Cappy Smith, and two half-brothers, James Swinden and Russell 
Penniman. But Marianne's parents, Antoinette and James Campbell, did attend, 
along with Morton's half-sister, Alletta Cooper, and reporters and 
photographers from the Enquirer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Marianne's a fine girl, she's well educated and she conducts herself very 
well," said James Campbell, a retired salesman. "I don't know what social class 
is, to tell you the truth. She has good morals, and she's a very good girl." 
</P>
<P>
 Morton and Marianne met when both were undergraduates at the University of 
Rhode Island. She had admired him, a handsome lacrosse player, from across 
crowded rooms many times. Finally, friends set them up. It was much later that 
she learned of his pedigree. 
</P>
<P>
 The seventh of nine children in an Italian American Catholic clan, Campbell 
grew up in Wilmington, a working-class suburb of Boston. She moved to 
California in 1987, a year after graduation from URI, to attend Pepperdine 
University, where she earned a master's degree in clinical psychology. Smith 
spent time abroad, was graduated from URI in 1988 and then settled here to be 
closer to Campbell and his family. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday, Campbell recalled that her relationship with her now-estranged 
mother-in-law was rocky from the start. 
</P>
<P>
 The day after the two women met about seven years ago, Campbell said, Joan 
Irvine Smith took her on a shopping spree she likened to the great make-over in 
the movie, "Pretty Woman," complete with a chauffeur to Rodeo Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 "She didn't like the way I dressed. She was determined to get me a whole new 
wardrobe," Campbell said. "We went in the back entrance to Hermes and they were 
serving champagne just for us and all the dressmakers were all swirling around 
me and giving me so much attention, 'Try this on, try that on,' and I was 
saying, 'OK, OK, OK,' not knowing that she was buying all this for me." 
</P>
<P>
 For years, there were beautiful gifts. Campbell was welcomed at Smith's ranch 
in San Juan Capistrano and the family's bucolic farm in Middleburg, Va. 
</P>
<P>
 But there were also periodic arguments and constant messages from family 
members that Marianne would not do, Morton Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not everything goes with (Joan Irvine Smith), you have to maintain a certain 
amount of decorum around her," said Jeff Fink, who was best man at the wedding 
and works in the sports book of a Las Vegas casino. "Marianne just didn't 
maintain that decorum. She was kind of herself. . . . She's very outspoken. 
She's a nice girl and everything, but she's not what Mrs. Smith was looking for 
for her son." 
</P>
<P>
 When Morton proposed marriage on Super Bowl Sunday, 1993, the couple said, 
word came that Morton was not welcome in Smith's Emerald Bay house -- and the 
locks were changed. His things from the farm in Middleburg were packed up and 
shipped to Calfornia. And then, finally, mom offered the ultimatum: "She said, 
'If you pick her, you're out of the family,' " Morton Smith recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was kind of like Qaddafi drawing the line of death. Then I'd cross the 
line and (she'd) draw a new one in the sand," he said. "It's pretty scary to 
have Joan mad at you. Everyone was scared but me. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm an Irvine, I can take it," he said. "I don't have anything (financial) to 
show for it, but breeding goes a long way."

THE MELDING AMERICAS; TRADE, DEMOCRACY BRIDGE OLD BARRIERS; CULTURAL TIES MEND 
CONTINENTAL DIVIDE 
</P>

 Latin American countries that once nationalized U.S.-owned businesses are now 
pushing for more U.S. investment and commerce. They can't wait to follow 
Mexico's footsteps into a free-trade agreement with yesterday's "Yankee 
imperialists." And U.S. companies are rushing south. 
</P>
<P>
 The Americas are coming together, melding -- and not just economically. 
Although Washington has often been the hemisphere's hated bully in the past, 
its affinity with Latin America today is flowering. 
</P>
<P>
 "As the number of Latin American migrants and refugees in the United States 
increases, and as the reach of telecommunications becomes broader, we're really 
becoming knit together," said Mark Rosenberg, a Latin America specialist at 
Florida International University in Miami. "So you have at one level a 
governmental interest, and at another level you have a social fabric that is 
getting knit even more closely together. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's just a whole set of influences that are growing," Rosenberg added. 
"There's a whole set of things that are taking place now that I think are 
positive in terms of greater harmony in the hemisphere." 
</P>
<P>
 Mexico, historically wary of American arrogance and dominance, has embraced 
the United States as a brother; the struggling nations of Central America, more 
peaceful and more democratic since the turbulent 1980s, no longer are a major 
source of U.S. heartburn and headaches, and on the vast continent of South 
America, elected governments from Colombia to Argentina actively seek a future 
of profitable inter-American unity. 
</P>
<P>
 For decades, both Central and South America seemed to rumble and shake with 
political conflict: revolutions, guerrilla wars, coups and countercoups. 
Widespread poverty deepened with the foreign debt crisis of the 1980s. Today, 
poverty remains worrisome, while residues of extremism and militarism also 
persist in some countries. 
</P>
<P>
 But political and ideological differences between America and Latin America 
have dramatically narrowed with the endorsement by nearly all Latin American 
governments of democratic forms and free-market reforms. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, millions of Americans are learning Spanish, and English-language 
schools are booming from Mexico to Argentina. Increasingly easier international 
communications and travel further strengthen hemispherical ties. More and more 
Latin Americans watch CNN, ESPN and MTV as cable television and dish antennas 
multiply throughout the region. In the United States, growing communities of 
Latinos tune in on Spanish-language radio stations and television networks that 
carry programming from their homelands. 
</P>
<P>
 Even food tastes are mixing and merging. An appetite for tacos and burritos 
has spread through the United States; in Latin America, cheeseburgers and 
Southern fried chicken have become popular fare. 
</P>
<P>
 Many Latin Americans still fear Yankee imperialism, whether economic, 
political, cultural or culinary. And some worry about the sovereignty of their 
countries when the Colossus of the North wields its "coercive diplomacy," as it 
did this month in Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 But all in all, as the century nears its close, the United States and Latin 
America are drawing closer than they have been since the century began. There 
has "never been a better time" for inter-American cooperation, said Paul 
Boeker, head of the La Jolla-based Institute of the Americas. "It really is a 
golden era historically in terms of convergence of not only political and 
economic values, but practical approaches to how you generate growth and social 
progress." 
</P>
<P>
 Democracy has become a common denominator between the United States and Latin 
America since the pendulum of power began swinging away from the widespread 
military rule of the 1970s. In contrast to earlier periods, elected governments 
reign in all but one of the region's 18 Spanish-speaking countries as well as 
Portuguese-speaking Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
 Communist Cuba is the exception. Only in Cuba does an entrenched Latin 
American government now stridently reject the basic political and economic 
principles of the United States. In recent regional summit meetings, other 
Latin American leaders have repeatedly urged Cuban President Fidel Castro to 
make democratic and market reforms. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside Cuba, the region's civilian governments are harmonizing their economic 
programs to favor free enterprise and open trade. This is music to the ears of 
Washington, which has long encouraged Latin America's departure from policies 
of state enterprise and protectionism. Free-trade alliances are developing 
vigorously in several areas of the region, and economic ties with the United 
States are growing stronger by the year. U.S. exports to Latin America, for 
example, grew by 64% between 1989 and 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are historic developments," Boeker said. "Not everyone in the U.S. 
Congress has absorbed this yet, but U.S. trade and investment with Latin 
America is growing faster than with anywhere else in the world." 
</P>
<P>
 The end of the Cold War, the decline of militarism and growing political 
stability have helped take the edge off of traditional Latin American 
nationalism and anti-Americanism. Many leftist parties in the region have 
become more centrist. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, anti-communism and great-power rivalry no longer color 
Washington's view of Latin America, observed Manuel Antonio Garreton, a 
professor of social sciences at the University of Chile. 
</P>
<P>
 Until the Soviet Bloc dissolved, he noted, "Latin America was just a place of 
competition with the Soviet Union." Now Washington has other priorities in the 
region. 
</P>
<P>
 "That means approaches can be made in terms of conveniences, interests, 
aspirations -- without prior ideological definition," the Chilean scholar said. 
</P>
<P>
 During most of the 1980s, U.S. interest in the hemisphere focused on what 
Washington depicted as a grave Marxist threat in Central America. Washington 
lavished military and development aid on the area, often intervening in 
political affairs of El Salvador, Nicaragua and Honduras. 
</P>
<P>
 As peace came to Central America, Washington quietly backed away. Official 
relations now are more distant -- but also less intrusive and more likely to 
focus on trade and investment that can lead to more solid and fruitful economic 
ties. 
</P>
<P>
 In the late 1980s, U.S. concerns segued from the waning menace of communism to 
the waxing threat of cocaine. As a result, Washington has dedicated billions of 
dollars and the time of hundreds of officials to anti-drug cooperation with 
Latin American authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 Those efforts so far have failed to curtail the flow of cocaine from the 
region into the United States, but they have taught the lesson that more 
effective inter-American cooperation is needed. 
</P>
<P>
 Drug trafficking by Panama's Gen. Manuel A. Noriega was given as a major 
reason for U.S. military intervention in that country in December, 1989, an 
invasion that recalled numerous previous episodes of U.S. intervention, 
political meddling and heavy-handed pressure in Latin America throughout this 
century. Traditionally, they have fed anti-Yankee sentiments. 
</P>
<P>
 The current intervention in Haiti may be different. With its French-Creole 
culture and its almost uninterrupted history of despotism, Haiti is a singular 
case in the hemisphere. Also, the nature of U.S. intervention has changed. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier in the century, U.S. action often favored American investors, 
right-wing elites and dictators. In both Panama and Haiti, the action was aimed 
at ending military dominance and supporting democratic government. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration's policy toward Latin America has no catchy title 
similar to the forgotten Good Neighbors Policy of President Franklin D. 
Roosevelt, the forsaken Alliance for Progress envisioned by John F. Kennedy or 
the short-lived Enterprise for the Americas pushed by George Bush. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, President Clinton has followed through on Bush policy, which emphasized 
free trade and private investment, and also on Jimmy Carter's policy of 
actively promoting democracy and human rights. With his military move into 
Haiti, however, Clinton has put a tougher edge on the policy than Carter did. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite events in Haiti, Latin American authorities today seem less interested 
in old issues of imperialism and sovereignty than in trade and investment. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States accounts for about 60% of all goods imported by Latin 
America and the Caribbean, a region with a growing population of 460 million. 
Total trade between the United States and Latin America was worth $141 billion 
in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 "What Latin Americans feel will put things on the kitchen table is economic 
growth," said Peter Cleaves, director of the Institute for Latin American 
Studies at the University of Texas. With some exceptions, Cleaves said, "there 
is a consensus throughout the region that the bread, if it's going to be 
buttered, will be buttered through the relationship with the United States." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton has invited Latin American and Caribbean leaders to a hemispherical 
summit Dec. 9 and 10 in Miami. The agenda will include efforts of many kinds to 
strengthen inter-American relations, and trade is expected to be one of the key 
items. 
</P>
<P>
 Both the Clinton Administration and the Bush Administration before it have 
endorsed the ideal of a hemispherical free-trade zone. The concept is 
attractive to Latin American countries that fear being left out as Asia, Europe 
and North America form powerful trade blocs that could dominate world commerce. 
</P>
<P>
 Former President Cesar Gaviria of Colombia, now secretary general of the 
Organization of American States, has said a hemispherical free-trade zone is 
one of his major goals. 
</P>
<P>
 "The hemisphere must become sooner rather than later an economic force," 
Gaviria said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other advocates agree that it would make sense to add all of Latin America to 
the North American Free Trade Agreement linking the United States, Mexico and 
Canada. 
</P>
<P>
 That will not be easy. Latin America has a long history of unsuccessful 
attempts at economic integration. Common markets can't work if their would-be 
members have incompatible governments, unstable economies and contradictory 
economic policies, as many Latin American countries did in past decades. 
Protectionism and nationalism also have helped foil earlier attempts at free 
trade in the region. Although those obstacles have been reduced substantially, 
there is no guarantee that they will not rise again. 
</P>
<P>
 On the U.S. side, labor leaders and environmentalists are dragging their feet. 
Unions worry that with free trade, low-wage workers in Latin America could 
siphon off American jobs and undermine U.S. pay standards. Environmentalists 
voice concerns about trade pacts with Latin American countries where 
protections are lax. 
</P>
<P>
 Some free-trade advocates say the influence of labor and environmentalists in 
the Democratic Party has cooled the Clinton Administration's enthusiasm for 
expanding NAFTA. Earlier this month, the Administration withdrew a bill from 
Congress that would have authorized "fast-track" procedures for negotiating 
free-trade agreements with other countries. 
</P>
<P>
 Finance Minister Eduardo Aninat of Chile, the leading Latin American advocate 
for a NAFTA-like trade pact, called withdrawal of the fast-track bill "an 
unnecessary delay that does not satisfy our expectations." 
</P>
<P>
 J. Michael Combes, manager of an American-owned company in Chile and former 
president of the Chilean-American Chamber of Commerce, warned that such hitches 
in progress toward hemispherical free trade could cool North-South relations. 
</P>
<P>
 "This fast track looked positive, and now it's being put back, and eventually 
the countries will get frustrated," Combes complained in an interview. "If 
something doesn't happen fairly soon, you're going to get, I think, a very 
severe cooling down, and then possibly some resentment. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that would be a great shame, I mean a great shame for the U.S.," he 
said. "This is becoming a dynamic continent. Things are really happening." 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1980s, most of Latin America suffered through an economic slump, with 
high inflation and unmanageable foreign debt. The crisis has passed, inflation 
is under control, and the regional economy is growing at a moderate rate. Trade 
is expanding, and foreign investment is pouring into many countries, more than 
half of it from the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 To a great degree, Latin American countries have abandoned old policies of 
protectionism and "import substitution," which shielded national industries 
from the foreign-import competition. One problem with import substitution was 
that protected industries often became comfortable and fat, producing inferior 
goods at inflated costs. Now, market policies are opening Latin American 
economies to foreign goods. That helps keep prices down and forces national 
industries to compete or wither. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not only the Latin Americans trying to accede to the U.S. market, but 
Latin America has become a very important market for the U.S., and I think the 
economic interdependence that can be developed over the next few years is to 
everybody's benefit," said Guatemalan economist Gert Rosenthal.  
</P>
<P>
 Rosenthal said the trend in Latin America should encourage efforts to create a 
hemispherical trade bloc. "What's going to happen probably is that we're going 
to have four or five sub-regional trading blocs within Latin America, which 
will tend to converge." Eventually, they could converge with NAFTA. 
</P>
<P>
 Judging by figures since liberalization of U.S.-Mexican trade began under 
NAFTA Jan. 1, both sides can profit. U.S. exports to Mexico in the second 
quarter of this year expanded by a robust 17% over the same period last year, 
while Mexico's exports to the United States grew by 19%.  
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, communications, which goes hand in hand with trade, has become a 
unifying force in the Americas. Plans are being discussed to link the 
hemisphere with an information superhighway of fiber-optics. Satellite 
communications have already brought what Rosenberg, the Florida educator, calls 
the "CNN-ization of hemispheric information." 
</P>
<P>
 With more communications, distorted stereotypes tend to break down. On one 
hand, Latin Americans find it more difficult to view Americans as arrogant, 
dollar-crazed imperialists. And Americans learn that there is much more to 
Latin America than poverty, guerrillas, cocaine smuggling and heavy-handed 
generals. 
</P>
<P>
 Great political, economic and cultural differences between the United States 
and Latin America remain undeniably real. But just as real are today's 
opportunities for bridging the gaps between these lands and peoples who already 
are connected by history and geography. 
</P>
<P>
 Nowhere is the opportunity more obvious than in Miami, the Southwest and 
Southern California -- the frontiers between Anglo and Latino America. Greater 
Miami's population is almost equally divided between Latinos and non-Latinos, 
and both have prospered as their ways of life have blended. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S.-Mexican border is becoming more a transit area and "zone of economic 
development and opportunity" than a boundary, Rosenberg observed. 
</P>
<P>
 "And that's what is going to happen with a lot of boundaries in Latin 
America," he said. "What's going on on the Texas-Mexican border is a harbinger 
of things to come in Latin America." Hemispherical Immigration to the U.S. 1993

THE MELDING AMERICAS; HERITAGE; MEXICO STRIVES TO HOLD ON TO ITS PAST; THE 
GOVERNMENT HAS BEGUN A PROGRAM TO ENSURE THE NATION'S CULTURE ENDURES AT A TIME 
OF ACCELERATING BICULTURAL FUSION. 
</P>

<P>
 Juan Enriquez was trying to make a point about Mexican-American biculturalism 
over breakfast last week when he suddenly leaped up from his bagel and tea. 
Leading a visitor to his late-model Chrysler -- the driver fielding the 
cellular phone in the back seat -- the Mexican entrepreneur set off on a 
whirlwind tour that he insisted would best illustrate his point. 
</P>
<P>
 It took half a day, and included a handful of projects totaling billions of 
dollars in investments that Enriquez put together during his five years as 
Mexico City's urban development director. 
</P>
<P>
 And it showcased the cutting edge of cultural, corporate fusion in 
developments that are changing the face of the Mexican megalopolis. 
</P>
<P>
 There was the $33-million National Auditorium, where state-of-the-art sound 
systems, acoustics, lighting and seating have helped 36-year-old, 
Harvard-educated director Oscar Elizundia Tevino build the second-most 
profitable theater in the world in just 36 months, drawing acts ranging from 
Paul Simon, Jethro Tull and Ray Charles to the best Latin groups and the 1993 
Miss Universe contest. 
</P>
<P>
 There was the high-tech Children's Museum, fully equipped with lasers, 
computer-generated imagery and the latest in interactive displays -- almost all 
of it financed by private corporate donations from the United States and Mexico 
and now in the hands of a private Mexican trust. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, there was Enriquez's centerpiece: The multibillion-dollar Santa Fe 
commercial center, the largest shopping mall in Latin America, housing 
merchandisers from Sears, Roebuck & Co. to an exclusive religious icon shop, 
where Hewlett Packard has built its steel-and-glass corporate offices beside 
the equally sleek headquarters of Mexico's second-largest financial group, and 
where bulldozers and cranes are now creating a new, traditional, Mexican-style 
town center -- all on what a few years ago was a 2,000-acre garbage dump and 
site of Mexico City's worst slum. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point during the dizzying tour, Enriquez, 35, was asked if he could 
have put all this together -- starting with a municipal budget 30% in the red 
-- without the benefit of his Harvard MBA. 
</P>
<P>
 "No," he said flatly, acknowledging the bicultural base of his vision and 
drive. Nor could he have managed it without the Mexican instincts he needed to 
break the powerful garbage mafias that ruled the dump with the threat of death 
over the 10,000 professional scavengers who lived there before the Santa Fe 
project retrained and re-employed them as sales clerks, technicians and 
construction workers. 
</P>
<P>
 The son of an American mother and a Mexican father who was born and raised in 
Mexico City, Enriquez is a model of the biculturalism that is helping to change 
the face of Mexico, other Latin countries and the United States -- particularly 
cities such as Los Angeles that are home to large Latino populations. 
</P>
<P>
 The economic and social benefits of biculturalism are a positive flip side to 
anti-migration arguments, and increasingly important in a massive, cross-border 
flow that the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service estimates at about 
300 million legal crossings a year along the U.S.-Mexico border in both 
directions. 
</P>
<P>
 The effects have begun to grow exponentially, from the grass-roots dollar 
impact on rural Mexican families that have sent hundreds of thousands of young 
men to work in California and other border states to the macro-level payoffs 
such as Enriquez's development projects. 
</P>
<P>
 But the young developer, like most analysts in Mexico's private and government 
sectors, points out that the U.S.-Latin fusion has its limits. 
</P>
<P>
 At the core of Enriquez's projects, for instance, has been a simple tenet: 
"You take the best of both cultures and make them work together. You take the 
best from there and make them work here. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think you're ever going to reach a level of bicultural oneness," he 
said, juggling his mobile phone and traffic jams behind the wheel of his car. 
"And I don't think our goal should be bicultural oneness. 
</P>
<P>
 "Both cultures have a great richness and a lot to offer each other. But there 
are several fundamental differences that I believe can never be erased, among 
them family, religion and the work ethic. For example, in Mexico, your main 
value doesn't tend to be work. Your identity is not your work, as it is in the 
United States. In Mexico, your work is only a means to an end." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at the highest levels of the Mexican government agree. At the root 
of government policy here is an assumption that Mexican culture is so strong 
and deeply rooted that it can never be overwhelmed by American influence. 
</P>
<P>
 And yet, in what some analysts see as an illustration of the depth of the 
dynamic, and Mexican concern about it, the government is underwriting a program 
to erase some of the cultural blurring in Mexican families that migrated to the 
United States generations ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Andres Rozental, Mexico's deputy foreign minister, said he helped launch the 
program six years ago to "build bridges" between Mexicans and Mexican Americans 
in the United States, largely to ensure that the Mexican culture endures at a 
time of accelerating bicultural fusion. 
</P>
<P>
 The program is administered through 20 Mexican Cultural Institutes throughout 
the United States. It sponsors visits to Mexico for gifted Mexican American 
schoolchildren, most of whom have never been to their homeland. It has supplied 
25 Mexican teachers to the Los Angeles Unified School District to teach Spanish 
and Mexican culture classes. And it sponsors Mexican art and literature 
programs for Mexican American communities in major U.S. cities. 
</P>
<P>
 "The idea behind it is based on the fact that what most of these kids in 
America have heard from the grandparents or parents all their lives are the 
negatives about Mexico -- the things they left behind," Rozental said. "Many 
don't even speak Spanish anymore, so we also sponsor language classes for the 
Mexican American community. 
</P>
<P>
 "In addition, we bring Mexican Americans to Mexico to help Mexicans know more 
about their brothers in the U.S." 
</P>
<P>
 At the core of the program, Rozental stressed, is the belief that, despite the 
signs of cultural fusion at all levels of Mexican society in Mexico and the 
United States, there is little risk that Mexicans will lose their distinct 
culture. 
</P>
<P>
 "Throughout the debate over NAFTA (the North American Free Trade Agreement), I 
was often asked by Mexicans and American alike whether I felt there was a 
concern about the spillover into cultural domination by the Americans," 
Rozental said. "The answer is no. Because there's an inherent difference 
between our two cultures, and that is that the Mexican culture is more 
profoundly rooted than the American culture. Here, it is much older; you don't 
have these 30 centuries of history and of cultural assimilation in America. 
</P>
<P>
 "Despite their loss of contact with their culture back home, even the Mexican 
American community we deal with has a culture that is very distinct from the 
American culture around it. 
</P>
<P>
 "In short, I don't think we'll ever see a dulling of the border. Rather, we 
are seeing a new culture emerging, and that is the Mexican American culture. 
But I think that is all on the other side of the border." 
</P>
<P>
 Enriquez, who left his urban development job when the mayor who sanctioned it 
left office last November, put it in somewhat more personal terms. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mexicans do not aspire to become Americans," he said. "I have no desire to 
make Santa Fe an American development. I want to take things that have worked 
in different parts of the world and apply them here in a way that works for 
Mexico." 
</P>
<P>
 And despite his own constant exposure to American culture in his schooling, at 
work and at home -- Enriquez's wife is American -- Enriquez laughed 
incredulously when asked whether he thinks of himself as an American or a 
Mexican. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm Mexican," he said. "This is my home."

 "The gringos, who later brought their languid women with muslin dresses and 
big gauze hats, built a separate town on the other side of the tracks, with 
palm lined streets, houses with metal grated windows, little white tables on 
the terraces and paddle fans hanging from the ceiling, and wide blue lawns with 
peacocks and quail. The sector was enclosed by a wire mesh fence, like a giant 
electrified chicken pen that in the cool months of summer woke up black with 
fried swallows. No one even knew yet what it was they wanted, or whether they 
really were nothing more than philanthropists, and they had already brought on 
a colossal disturbance, much more disquieting than the gypsies of old, but less 
transitory and comprehensible. Equipped with resources that in another era were 
reserved for Divine Providence, they modified the rainfall regime, hastened the 
harvest cycle, and took the river from where it always had been and put it with 
its white rocks and its cold currents on the other side of the town, behind the 
cemetery. It was on that occasion that they built a concrete fortress over the 
discolored tomb of Jose Arcadio, so that the odor of cadaver dust would not 
contaminate the waters."

 "Upon initiating my life in the United States, I resided for some time in Los 
Angeles, a city inhabitated by more than a million persons of Mexican descent. 
At first sight, the traveler is surprised by -- besides the pureness of the sky 
and the ugliness of the dispersed and ostentatious constructions -- the vaguely 
Mexican atmosphere of the city, impossible to capture in words or concepts. 
This Mexicanness -- a taste for adornments, carelessness and splendor, 
negligence, passion and reserve -- floats in the air. And I say floats because 
it does not mix nor is it joined with the other world, the North American 
world, made of precision and efficiency. Floats but does not oppose; is 
balanced, driven by the wind, at times torn like a cloud, at others 
straightened like a rocket shooting off. It is dragged along, it yields, it 
expands, it contracts, sleeps or dreams, ragged beauty. It floats: It does not 
cease to exist, does not disappear."

 "The North American has to understand that Latin America comes from things 
that you have never known at all. You have never known Indian empires based on 
theocracy and vertical structures of power. You were not colonized by a 
European autocracy constructed also in a vertical fashion. . . . Which means 
the common good is the purpose of politics, and it is best achieved by unity 
exercised through one will, through an autocracy. That is ingrained in the 
Latin American soul."

THE MELDING AMERICAS; SOCIETY; MIAMI: A LABORATORY OF SOCIAL CHANGE; THE 
MIGRANT STREAM FROM LATIN AMERICA AND THE CARIBBEAN, COUPLED WITH 30 YEARS OF 
WHITE FLIGHT, HAS PUSHED THE CITY TO THE FRONTIER OF THE URBAN FUTURE.

 This sun-spangled city on Biscayne Bay is just 200 miles north of Havana, or 
260 miles closer to the Cuban capital than it is to Florida's capital -- 
Tallahassee. 
</P>
<P>
 That's only the geographical part of the story. But in a way that's all you 
need to know. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the last 30 years, Miami has been the crucible for demographic drift, a 
subtropical impact zone where North meets South -- not with a bang but with an 
abrazo , a hug . Bilingual, bicultural and by itself, Miami is the only truly 
Latin city in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "Miami has undergone the most dramatic ethnic transformation of any major 
American city in this century," said Guillermo J. Grenier, a Florida 
International University sociologist. "The downside is that the continued flow 
of immigrants has strained the social safety net. But for Americans, coming 
here is like going to another country without a passport." 
</P>
<P>
 The migrant stream from Latin America and the Caribbean, coupled with 30 years 
of white flight, have pushed Miami to the frontier of the urban future; it's a 
laboratory of social change. One-third of greater Miami's 2 million residents 
are foreign-born, and even in a year when 40,000 Cuban rafters are not trying 
to sail in, as they are this year, the population still grows by 20,000 Latin 
American migrants annually. 
</P>
<P>
 There is not much Deep South in America's southernmost major city. One only 
need arrive at Miami International Airport, step into a cab, enter a hotel or 
walk the streets and overhear conversations to appreciate that this is a place 
unlike any other in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Los Angeles and New York have larger numbers of Latino residents, but in 
no other major American city do Latinos make up a larger percentage of the 
overall population -- 50% in greater Miami -- and in no other is Spanish so 
widely used and heard. 
</P>
<P>
 When he moved from Detroit to Miami five years ago, for example, David 
Lawrence Jr. quickly realized that he needed to learn the local language. So he 
started studying, eventually traveling to Uruguay for an immersion course. And 
despite a telltale accent, today Lawrence considers himself a fully 
functioning, bilingual citizen of Florida's largest city. 
</P>
<P>
 The fact that Lawrence is the publisher of the Miami Herald, an 
English-language newspaper and one of this city's oldest Anglo institutions, 
only serves to underscore the reality of life here.  
</P>
<P>
 "You do not need to know Spanish to make it in Miami," Lawrence insists. 
Nonetheless, he oversees the publication of El Nuevo Herald, the largest 
Spanish-language daily in the country (circulation: 101,000 daily, 126,600 
Sunday). And he speaks Spanish regularly over the telephone to Herald 
subscribers and in person to civic groups. While it is still possible to get 
along here without hablando espanol , it is often inconvenient. 
</P>
<P>
 Non-Latino whites still control most major corporations here and occupy a 
disproportionate number of influential civic roles. But six of the 13 Dade 
County commissioners are Latino, as are two of Miami's five commissioners, 
while the county manager, the City of Miami manager and the mayors of Hialeah 
and Coral Gables are all Cuban-born. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as the prevailing breeze in Miami comes from the southeast -- the 
direction of Cuba -- so too do the city's rhythm and cultural influence. Of the 
1 million Latinos in Dade County, more than 59% trace their origins to Cuba, 
and most of Miami's eight Spanish-language AM radio stations and two 
Spanish-language television networks gear their programming to a Cuban 
audience. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the size of the Cuban majority among Latinos has declined over the last 20 
years -- it was 90% in 1970 -- as thousands of migrants from Nicaragua, 
Colombia, the Dominican Republic and other nations poured in. 
</P>
<P>
 So while Little Havana remains a highly visible, vibrant neighborhood of 
grocery stores and small restaurants, monuments to Cuban heroes, Domino Park 
and the only McDonald's serving Cuban coffee, the Cuban-American majority in 
Miami lives everywhere, surrounding Little Nicaragua, and Little Haiti, and the 
Puerto Rican neighborhood of Wynwood, and areas populated by French Canadians, 
and yes, even an enclave of European Jews on Miami Beach where, as the in-line 
skaters swerve in and out, shouts of "Watch it!" go up in Yiddish and Russian. 
</P>
<P>
 As recently as 30 years ago, Miami was primarily a winter destination for 
Americans from the northeastern states. The typical visitor came from New York, 
and he and his family stayed on Miami Beach, where they went swimming in the 
Atlantic Ocean, ate lunch at Pumpernik's and went home after a week or two with 
their annual sunburn. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Pumpernik's is closed, and the typical visitor comes from Caracas or 
Buenos Aires. He and his family stay in the Intercontinental Hotel, or maybe in 
a condominium they own on Brickell Avenue. They come here to shop and conduct 
business, and the only time they see the ocean is when they glance to the east 
some night when departing a South Miami Beach club. 
</P>
<P>
 Once called the Magic City, now Miami is the capital of the Caribbean, or the 
City of the Future, the New Casablanca, Paradise Lost or Paradise Found. 
</P>
<P>
 "Miami is a gateway city, an entry point to the U.S. where visitors from Latin 
America can deal with the U.S. without feeling culture shock," said Mayco 
Villafana of the Greater Miami Convention and Visitors Bureau. "We get a lot of 
people who bring the family, enjoy the beaches, go shopping and also do 
business, all in their own language." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, so friendly has Miami become for Spanish-speaking vacationers and 
business people that this year for the first time visitors to greater Miami 
from Latin America will surpass the domestic total, said Villafana. The numbers 
are revealing: In 1989, 1.2 million of Miami's 7.7 million visitors came from 
Latin America, which includes South and Central America and the Caribbean. 
Domestic visitors represented 61% of the total. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, when the total number of visitors reached 8.8 million, Latin 
Americans accounted for 3.4 million, a number equal to the domestic total. 
Europeans and tourists from other parts of the world made up the difference. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the changing trend is due to Miami's image problems. Fear of crime, 
and what Villafana calls "the perception that somehow things here are too 
foreign," have resulted in a sharp decline in domestic tourism to Miami. Most 
Americans who take family vacations in Florida never get south of Orlando and 
the Magic Kingdom. 
</P>
<P>
 Fueling the perceptions is a volatile vat of reality. Crime, especially 
sensational killings and assaults on tourists, has scarred Miami's reputation. 
And many of those travelers who come anyway often express surprise at the look 
and feel of Miami, hot and hectic and abuzz with the sounds of Spanish and 
Creole. 
</P>
<P>
 But while greater Miami's $7.2-billion tourist trade has stalled, the area's 
importance as an international trade and banking center is picking up speed. 
Thirty percent of all U.S. trade with Latin America, valued at $21 billion in 
1993, goes through Miami, according to the Beacon Council, a development group. 
More than 60 international banks have offices here, along with 28 binational 
chambers of commerce, 20 foreign trade offices and 50 foreign consulates, 
including one from every nation in South and Central America.  
</P>
<P>
 The trigger for the transformation of greater Miami -- from a vaguely Southern 
metropolis populated by refugees from the north, arriviste developers and a 
seasonal tourist traffic to a colorful salad bowl of ethnicity -- was the Cuban 
Revolution. Within two years of Fidel Castro's 1959 triumph, the Cuban middle 
class began to flee, and by 1973, about 400,000 refugees from communism -- 
mostly white, urban and educated -- had settled in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 The migration precipitated a Miami make-over, changing the feel of the urban 
area from a hodgepodge of 20-odd municipalities without much of a defining 
character to a sprawling Havana Norte, the second largest Cuban city in the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1960, Dade County had 935,000 residents, 80% of whom were non-Latino 
whites. Blacks accounted for 13%, and Latinos were just 4% of the population. 
</P>
<P>
 By 1994, the population of Dade County has more than doubled, to an estimated 
2 million people. And in those 34 years the percentage of Latinos shot up to 
50%, and blacks now represent 21% of the total. Non-Latino whites are down to 
29%. 
</P>
<P>
 The result of that sea change in ethnic composition has been to turn Miami 
into a unique experiment in what sociologists call "acculturation in reverse," 
in which those Anglos and African Americans who have not already fled the 
Latinization of Miami succumb to it.  
</P>
<P>
 "There is no mainstream" in Miami, argue Alex Stepick and Alejandro Portes in 
their book "City on the Edge: The Transformation of Miami" (University of 
California Press, 1993). 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, they say, what has flowered here is a biculturalism made up of 
parallel social systems, one Latino, one non-Latino, that overlap and form a 
hybrid into which most immigrants -- from north or south -- are assimilated. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cosmopolitan, a true plural society," said Anthony Maingot, a sociologist 
with the University of Miami's North-South Center. "And the fascinating thing 
is that I don't think what has happened in Miami can be replicated anywhere 
else. Miami was lucky." 
</P>
<P>
 According to Maingot, Miami lucked out because that first wave of Cuban 
immigrants was white, educated and middle-class, precisely the type of people 
who would have been successful in New York, Madrid or Paris. 
</P>
<P>
 These immigrants' skills and work ethic made it easy for Miami's Anglo-Jewish 
Establishment to accept them, Maingot said, and together they created the 
network that would support those less-educated Cubans who followed. 
</P>
<P>
 "What that early integration left us with is a city that functions and is 
flexible enough to absorb substantial numbers of immigrants who continue to 
come," Maingot said. "Miami works." 
</P>
<P>
 Alas, it does not work for everybody. The Latinization of Miami, and the 
relative prosperity of Cuban emigres, has caused resentment, especially among 
many African Americans. Competition for jobs between blacks and Latinos grows. 
Three times in the 1980s, black neighborhoods in Miami erupted in riots, and 
contributing to each uprising were bitter feelings of exclusion. Dade County's

THE MELDING AMERICAS; DIPLOMACY; END OF COLD WAR HAS RADICALLY CHANGED 
U.S.-LATIN RELATIONS; MOST HAPPY TO SEE END TO HEAVY-HANDEDNESS, BUT FEAR 
NEGLECT BY WASHINGTON.

<P>
 The new American ambassador to Nicaragua stunned observers earlier this year 
when he acknowledged that the history of U.S. actions in Central America had 
essentially encouraged dictators and weakened national political systems. 
</P>
<P>
 As he met with polarized Nicaragua's left and right, U.S. Ambassador John 
Maisto also carried this new message: Solve your own problems, Nicaraguans, 
because the United States is staying out of the fray.  
</P>
<P>
 Wait a minute. 
</P>
<P>
 Was this not a representative of the same country whose government spent years 
and millions bolstering one heavy-handed leader -- Anastasio Somoza -- and then 
spent more years and more millions to topple another -- Daniel Ortega and his 
Sandinista colleagues? 
</P>
<P>
 The same country that gave us William Walker, the 19th-Century adventurer who 
declared himself president of Nicaragua? The same country that, for as long as 
any Nicaraguan could remember, had been meddling in Nicaraguan affairs -- often 
at the invitation of rival Nicaraguan groups? 
</P>
<P>
 Nicaraguans were confused. Those who had routinely turned to Washington for 
help felt abandoned. Those who had been Washington's enemies, like the 
Sandinistas, harbored skepticism. But some Nicaraguans liked what they heard 
and went about the business of trying to rebuild a country wrecked by war and 
poverty. 
</P>
<P>
 Maisto's arrival in the Managua milieu illustrates the changing relationship 
between Washington and Central America and the other nations of the hemisphere, 
a relationship no longer painted in the simplistic colors of the Cold War, no 
longer based solely on security issues. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Clinton Administration has the opportunity to begin a new generation, a 
new policy and a new era in the polarizing and contradictory relations that 
Washington has maintained with Managua for more than a century . . . and (with) 
the rest of Central America," said Xabier Gorostiaga, a Jesuit priest who heads 
the University of Central America in Managua. 
</P>
<P>
 "We cannot fail to take advantage of this new attitude," he added, advocating 
a restructuring of U.S. economic aid to target small farmers instead of large 
producers. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexico expects to parlay the North American Free Trade Agreement into a 
lasting partnership with U.S. business. Chile hopes to gain entry into a 
regional trade agreement similar to Mexico's. And Argentina's quest for 
closeness with the U.S government has been a cornerstone of its foreign policy 
ever since the 1989 election of President Carlos Saul Menem. The relative 
stability of most of South America in recent years makes it an appealing 
partner for North American officials and entrepreneurs. 
</P>
<P>
 But nowhere has the shift in geopolitical dynamics been more dramatic than in 
Central America, where the thrust of U.S. policy for the entire decade of the 
1980s boiled down to one goal: fighting communism. 
</P>
<P>
 This meant pouring money and offering unlimited military training to wage war 
against Marxist guerrillas, such as the Farabundo Marti National Liberation 
Front, or FMLN, of El Salvador, and leftist governments such as the Sandinista 
regime. It meant forming alliances with governments and movements for the 
shared, singular objective of stopping a Soviet-backed menace. It often meant 
ignoring or downplaying the human rights records and corrupt practices of some 
of those allies, such as the Honduran army and the Salvadoran right. 
</P>
<P>
 The governments of Central America that were U.S. allies became adept at 
enunciating the same goals, and they benefited as the aid flowed in. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Washington's relationship with Central America is more complex. In some 
cases, onetime friends on the right are now Washington's bitter adversaries, 
while former foes on the left attend U.S.-financed business seminars. And in a 
startling reversal from previous decades, Washington has found itself sitting 
on the sidelines of some Central American political disputes and elections, 
while Central American governments have declined to toe the U.S. line on Haiti, 
at the population conference in Cairo and in other matters. 
</P>
<P>
 Some critics of past policy say the relationship today is more healthy, more 
diverse. Others say it suffers from inattention and neglect. Many Central 
Americans believe that, after a decade of being a focal point of U.S. policy, 
the region has fallen off the map. The once plentiful money is drying up, and 
some capitals went months without U.S. ambassadors, something that would have 
been unthinkable in the decade of intervention. 
</P>
<P>
 "Compared to the past, relations have obviously improved, in that the United 
States no longer gets involved directly in the internal affairs of Central 
American countries. There is no reason to do so," said Joaquin Tacsan, an 
official of Costa Rica's Arias Foundation, a think tank run by former President 
Oscar Arias, the 1987 Nobel laureate for his regional peace-building efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 "But on the other hand, the improvements have provoked the other extreme: 
indifference. Central American countries feel they have been displaced from the 
eyes of the world." 
</P>
<P>
 The Central American countries that emerged from the 1980s are, generally 
speaking, more democratic than they were 10 years ago. Opposition parties are 
able to participate in politics without a high physical risk. The wars have 
ended in El Salvador and Nicaragua, and may soon end in Guatemala. 
</P>
<P>
 But with some exceptions, the countries are also poorer than ever and are 
faced with huge, costly tasks of reconciliation and reconstruction. The elite 
continue to enjoy impunity, and justice systems remain flawed. 
</P>
<P>
 With U.S. economic aid slashed to a fraction of its previous levels, many 
Central Americans are now looking to the United States for investors and 
partners in trade. Governments are pursuing free-market policies, which promote 
economic growth and appeal to U.S. business, but can plunge the poor deeper 
into poverty. 
</P>
<P>
 Also receiving U.S. attention, albeit on a secondary level, is the building of 
democratic institutions. A new civilian police force in El Salvador is largely 
financed and trained by Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 And some governments, notably those of El Salvador and Guatemala, have pleaded 
for a more lenient U.S. immigration policy. More than a million Salvadorans 
fled north during the last decade, and the money they send home keeps the 
Salvadoran economy afloat. Large-scale deportations would spell disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 In the more than two years since a U.N.-sponsored peace process ended the 
Salvadoran civil war, the Salvadoran government has had to adjust to a new 
Washington agenda with different kinds of strings attached. There is less money 
to go around, and the former rebels, who laid down their weapons and formed a 
political party, are receiving a share of it -- much to the chagrin of the 
United States' former allies on the right. 
</P>
<P>
 Through a U.S.-funded land bank, for example, former rebels have been given 
seed money to start coffee cooperatives and other agricultural projects. 
</P>
<P>
 Some on the right and in the military, who became accustomed to preferential 
treatment as long as they presented a unified front against communism, feel 
left out and have become born-again patriots. 
</P>
<P>
 "Strangely, the American Administration today forgets that the FMLN was its 
true enemy," said Kirio Waldo Salgado, one of El Salvador's most vocal 
commentators on the far right.  
</P>
<P>
 Another sign of changing dynamics came with El Salvador's presidential 
election in April. For the first time in recent memory, the U.S. government did 
not back anyone in the contest, which pitted a candidate from the ruling right 
against one who had the support of the former guerrillas. 
</P>
<P>
 The left's candidate, former legislator Ruben Zamora, lost. But during the 
campaign he frequently marveled at the lunch invitations that he, once an 
outcast, was receiving from the U.S. Embassy. 
</P>
<P>
 "The crux of the discussion between the United States and Latin America is no 
longer communism and anti-communism, leftist and rightist," Zamora said. "These 
things are increasingly irrelevant. The crux today is something else -- it's 
free trade (and) the capacity of political groups to guarantee stability inside 
the countries" of Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, leftists in El Salvador and Guatemala continue to protest when 
U.S. troops arrive to build roads and bridges. Many see an ulterior motive to 
the rapprochement, believing U.S. officials are currying favor with moderate 
leftists, hoping to isolate the more extreme elements. 
</P>
<P>
 And in Nicaragua -- despite Ambassador Maisto's upbeat approach -- the years 
of mistrust have not been completely erased. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Senate, largely at the behest of Jesse Helms, continues to 
periodically threaten to cut off aid to Nicaragua because of disputes over 
property confiscated during Sandinista rule. And officials in President Violeta 
Barrios de Chamorro's government are resentful of what they see as the failure 
of the United States to come through with promised postwar aid. 
</P>
<P>
 As they prepare for the Summit of the Americas with President Clinton in Miami 
in December, Central American leaders are going over their wish lists. 
</P>
<P>
 Most agree that the summit should concentrate on economic issues: 
strengthening commercial ties, expanding markets for Central American textiles 
and foods, limiting quotas on key exports such as bananas and sugar and 
devising a plan of sustainable development. 
</P>
<P>
 But among the Central American countries, in contrast to neighbors in South 
America, there is little agreement. Each government seems bent on defending the 
interests of its own tiny economy, analysts say. That discord threatens to 
undermine any effort by Central America to emerge as a trading bloc.

THE MELDING AMERICAS; POLICY; U.S. TRYING TO REFOCUS ITS RELATIONS WITH 
NEIGHBORS IN POST-COLD WAR ERA; WHILE TRADE AND POLITICAL CONDITIONS ARE 
FAVORABLE, CRISES SUCH AS CUBA AND HAITI GET IN THE WAY OF PROGRESS.

<P>
 When the Senate Foreign Relations Committee was considering the confirmation 
of Alexander F. Watson as the State Department's key official on Latin America 
last year, all of the questions posed by lawmakers concerned just three 
countries -- Cuba, Haiti and Nicaragua -- near flyspecks when laid against the 
expanse of the Western Hemisphere. 
</P>
<P>
 Watson, assistant secretary of state for Latin American affairs, later 
recalled that he joked to South American journalists that the senators had 
agreed not to ask about any country with a population of more than 15 million. 
</P>
<P>
 With the end of the Cold War, which had skewed U.S. relations with Latin 
America for most of the last half-century, the United States is trying to 
refocus its approach to its closest neighbors on trade, investment and the 
promotion of democracy. Administration officials say conditions in the 
Hemisphere -- especially in the larger countries, such as Brazil, Argentina, 
Chile and Mexico -- are more favorable than they have been for decades for 
cooperative U.S.-Latin relations on those subjects. 
</P>
<P>
 It may yet work out that way, of course, but crises such as the outpouring of 
Cuban raft refugees and the occupation of Haiti keep getting in the way. 
</P>
<P>
 "The great tragedy about Cuba and Haiti is that it was almost predictable that 
these issues would come up and dominate the agenda and force out broader 
subjects," said Kenneth R. Maxwell, director of the Latin America project of 
the Council on Foreign Relations in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no long-term strategic thinking at all," Maxwell said. "Americans 
who don't focus much on Latin America tend to see Latin America as Nicaragua 
writ large or Cuba writ large or Haiti writ large. If you go to a huge vibrant 
city like Sao Paulo (Brazil), that's where Latin America is dealing with 
problems." 
</P>
<P>
 Administration officials concede that with about 15,000 U.S. troops deployed 
in Haiti, it is not surprising that public attention is drawn to that unstable, 
violent and impoverished Caribbean nation. 
</P>
<P>
 "This has always been sort of a neglected area of U.S. foreign policy," one 
State Department official admitted. "We only seem to deal with Latin America 
when there are problems or unsavory dictators." 
</P>
<P>
 But he said the Clinton Administration, driven in part by the hemispherical 
summit scheduled for December in Miami, "is taking a closer look at Latin 
America on matters of trade and on our own agenda, like democracy and control 
of corruption." 
</P>
<P>
 Trade is clearly the most important subject for both the United States and the 
Latin countries. Commerce between the United States and other hemispherical 
countries is expanding rapidly, the total figures driven by success of the 
North American Free Trade Agreement which slashed barriers on 
U.S.-Mexican-Canadian trade. If present trends continue, the United States will 
soon sell more goods and services to Latin America than to Germany and Japan 
combined, trade officials predict. 
</P>
<P>
 For years, Latin American nations have raised tariff walls and other 
restraints to protect weak local industries. After a year of NAFTA, however, 
most Latin countries are interested in liberalizing their trade with the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mexico was the most anti- gringo country in the hemisphere," the State 
Department official said. "If they are willing to sign on with the 800-pound 
gorilla, that is reassuring to others." 
</P>
<P>
 But Washington is not yet ready to invite all of the hemisphere into NAFTA. 
The official said Chile's economy is the only one which seems "ready for a 
free-trade agreement with us." 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, he said, the Administration is looking for some sort of trade 
liberalization gesture to be unveiled at the Miami summit that will show 
hemispherical countries "that there is life after NAFTA." 
</P>
<P>
 Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay have formed an economic union that is 
considered a prime candidate to cooperate with NAFTA. 
</P>
<P>
 Maxwell, the Council on Foreign Relations authority on Latin America, said 
there is a danger that the organization will become a competitor instead of an 
associate if Washington does not move quickly to establish a new relationship. 
</P>
<P>
 An Administration official said Brazil, which has South America's largest 
economy, does not aspire to NAFTA membership but does not want to be left 
behind by hemisphere-wide trade liberalization. 
</P>
<P>
 "I call the Brazilians the 'French of Latin America,' " the official said. 
"They can be a bit prickly. They see us as a rival to their leadership 
ambitions." 
</P>
<P>
 But even counting a bit of trade friction with the Brazilians, Administration 
officials and non-government experts agree that U.S. relations with most Latin 
countries are better than they have been for decades. 
</P>
<P>
 "U.S.-Latin American relations have improved significantly over the past three 
or four years since the Cold War ended, the debt crisis receded and Central 
America's wars ended," said Peter Hakim, president of Inter-American Dialogue, 
a private organization with close ties to some members of President Clinton's 
Cabinet. "The Administration seems ready to incorporate all of Latin America 
into some kind of economic agreement. Unfortunately, the Administration during 
this year has not managed to carry forward this momentum. There is an 
uneasiness that we don't know how to take advantage of all these good things." 
</P>
<P>
 One purpose of the December summit, the first such meeting of hemisphere heads 
of government since 1967, is to try to seize the opportunities presented by the 
economic and political advances of the region. Although some of the governments 
may fall a bit short of the ideals set out in civics textbooks, 33 of the 35 
governments in the hemisphere are at least nominal democracies. Cuba and Haiti 
stand alone as the only countries without elected governments, and if Haiti's 
military leaders keep the agreement they made to avert a U.S. invasion nine 
days ago, Haiti will switch to the democratic column sometime next month. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. summit planners say they will focus the talks on three areas -- trade, 
democracy and economic development. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials said Latin leaders have indicated they are prepared to talk 
about political corruption at this summit, a topic they previously resisted. 
And Latin governments are eager to discuss ways of preserving democracy 
throughout the region. 
</P>
<P>
 One official said Washington hopes the summit will produce "a set of 
initiatives that are important enough to be considered presidential." He 
declined to list examples, but he added: "We are absolutely determined to make 
this a substantive summit." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the advances, however, the region can still cause headaches for U.S. 
policy-makers, as the situations in Cuba and Haiti demonstrate. 
</P>
<P>
 Administration officials and non-governmental experts say problems remain in 
Colombia and Bolivia because of the cocaine trade; in Peru because of President 
Alberto Fujimori's "auto coup" in which the democratically elected president 
ousted the Congress and the judiciary, and Venezuela because of economic and 
political unrest. A State Department official said the Administration is also 
concerned about Nicaragua because the elected government there has allowed the 
Marxist Sandinista Liberation Front to retain control of the armed forces. 
</P>
<P>
 But overall, Central America, which U.S. Administrations once considered a 
source of problems almost across the board, is now reasonably stable and ready 
to take off economically, the State Department official said. 
</P>
<P>
 Argentina, once a hotbed of anti-American rhetoric, has become so friendly to 
the United States that it agreed to contribute soldiers to the U.S.-led 
military operation in Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 Internally, Washington's decision to use military force to restore an elected 
government in Haiti establishes a precedent that could prove troublesome. There 
are 33 democracies -- some new and fragile -- in the hemisphere. If any of them 
face military coups, will Washington feel bound to use force to preserve 
democracy? 
</P>
<P>
 Administration officials insist that there is no obligation, although they say 
Washington can be expected to exert maximum political and economic pressure if 
any of the democracies are threatened. 
</P>
<P>
 The Council on Foreign Relations' Maxwell was far blunter in his assessment: 
"That is an impossible task, and Haiti probably will demonstrate that. This is 
where rhetoric catches you up."

THE MELDING AMERICAS; ECONOMY; BUSINESS BREAKS THROUGH OLD BARRIERS OF FEAR; 
LATIN GOVERNMENTS IN PAST HAVE BEEN SUSPICIOUS OF FOREIGN INVESTMENT, U.S. 
FIRMS WARY OF CORRUPTION. BUT TIMES ARE CHANGING.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Not long ago, business was among the most divisive issues in U.S. relations 
with Latin America. Latin governments looked suspiciously on foreign investment 
as a menace to be regulated; U.S. companies were just as wary of 
expropriation-prone politicians who might confiscate their oil wells, 
plantations or mines overnight. 
</P>
<P>
 But nowadays, doing business is a driving force in bringing the Americas 
closer. Governments are even beginning to look upon foreign businesses as 
allies that can help them solve perennial problems. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, the Brazilian government is paying Raytheon $1 billion for a 
radar surveillance service to help stop poaching and monitor drug trafficking 
in the Amazon rain forest. Across Latin America, U.S. corporations are tackling 
one of the region's most persistent irritations -- lousy phone service. The 
Americans are the new owners of the notoriously unpopular national telephone 
companies, purchased from governments eager to unload the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 The most obvious political evidence of closer relationships in the hemisphere 
is the abundance of new trade alliances, starting with the 10-month-old North 
American Free Trade Agreement and extending to South America's Mercosur, a 
combine of Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay. The big alliances 
complement a growing number of bilateral deals. 
</P>
<P>
 Even outside these agreements, import tariffs are tumbling. Mexico's average 
tariff fell from 27% a decade ago to 13% last year. Chile's average has been 
11% for the last five years. 
</P>
<P>
 Once highly protectionist, Brazil has slashed tariffs from an average of 51% 
in 1986 to 14.2% this year. This month, the Brazilian government cut tariffs on 
13,000 items. Imported autos, televisions, microwave ovens, stereos and video 
cassettes will all be cheaper as tariffs fall from 35% and 30% to 20%. 
</P>
<P>
 Lower tariffs should mean more robust trade. As Mexican tariffs fell over the 
last five years, two-way trade with the United States has doubled. Overall, 
American trade with Latin nations reached $141.5 billion last year, a 45% 
increase over 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Investment has followed commerce, with U.S. money pouring into Latin American 
stock markets, industrial parks and natural-resource companies. 
</P>
<P>
 Already among the largest investors in the region, American auto makers have 
stepped up their activities. General Motors is pumping $90 million into a new 
pickup truck factory in Cordoba, Argentina, and building another factory in 
Silao, Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. corporations are important investors in Chilean and Peruvian copper 
mines. Between them, Exxon Overseas Investment Corp. and Phelps Dodge have sunk 
nearly $2 billion into Chilean mining and have authorizations to invest $1.5 
billion more. 
</P>
<P>
 In Peru, William Massey, president of the American Chamber of Commerce there 
as well as the country's Goodyear subsidiary, noted: "I'd say that Peru is No. 
1 on the list in Latin America. . . . People are amazed at how easy it is to 
invest. The proof is the number of new mining companies that have been formed." 
</P>
<P>
 Those include Newmont Mining Corp. and Cyprus Minerals, in addition to two oil 
companies, Advantage Resources International Co. and American International 
Petroleum Corp. Peru. All are U.S.-owned.  
</P>
<P>
 Cyprus Minerals started off paying the government $37 million for the Cerro 
Verde copper mine, planning to invest $485 million more. Southern Peru Copper 
Corp. paid $65 million for a formerly government-owned copper refinery and 
plans to invest $445 million over the next five years.  
</P>
<P>
 Thus the government decision to sell off companies has fostered the growth of 
foreign investment in Peruvian mining -- as it has in many other sectors of 
Latin American industry. 
</P>
<P>
 In Argentina, U.S. investors put $1.5 billion -- 27% of the total -- into 
privatization from 1990 to May, 1994. GTE Corp. and American Telephone & 
Telegraph became part of the management team at the Venezuelan telephone 
company, Cantv, when the government sold controlling interest in the company in 
1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides selling off their own companies, governments have encouraged foreign 
capital by lifting restrictions on the industries in which foreigners may 
invest. 
</P>
<P>
 Late last year, Mexico replaced its 20-year-old "Law to Regulate Foreign 
Investment and Encourage Domestic Investment" with a more neutrally titled 
"Foreign Investment Law." The liberalized law permits broader foreign ownership 
of mines, airlines, airports, ports, farmland, courier services and 
cross-border freight. Two dozen applicants are now eagerly waiting to hear 
which will be the first foreign financial institutions licensed to open banks 
in Mexico in almost six decades. 
</P>
<P>
 Other countries in the region have opened up their oil industries. Esso 
Argentina, an Exxon subsidiary, plans to invest $80 million to $90 million over 
the next decade. Mobil Oil Corp. is exploring Peru's Madre de Dios basin in 
southeastern Peru. Even government contracts are opening up. Hughes Aircraft, 
bidding against a French company, recently won a contract to provide launching 
services for a Brazilian satellite. Before 1992, only Brazilian companies were 
allowed to provide such services. 
</P>
<P>
 Importantly, there has also been a change in attitude about what has been the 
most important unwritten restriction on U.S. business in Latin America: 
corruption. In a sign that the days of impunity are over, both Venezuela and 
Brazil have jailed sitting presidents on corruption charges. 
</P>
<P>
 In Chile, bribes and kickbacks are not acceptable, foreign businessmen say. 
"If you are dealing with public officials, you'll get into trouble, and if you 
are dealing with private officials, it will cause offense," said J. Michael 
Combes of the U.S.-owned Marco Chilean shipbuilding company in Chile. 
Investment, meanwhile, is not all flowing one way. Mexico's Vitro Corp. paid 
$800 million for money-losing Anchor Glass Container Corp. in 1989, turning the 
company around in less than a year. Cementos Mexicanos, or Cemex, has become 
North America's largest cement maker, partly by buying up its U.S. competitors. 
</P>
<P>
 Cemex launched its aggressive acquisition campaign as a defensive measure when 
European companies tried to enter the Mexican market. Ironically, those same 
non-American companies have used U.S. anti-dumping laws to prevent Cemex from 
operating its North American holdings as a single cross-border unit. 
</P>
<P>
 And investment from the north is creating trade flows from the south. Ford 
Motor Co. plans to start exporting from its old Cuautitlan plant in central 
Mexico this week. The company already makes Mercury Tracers for the world 
market in Hermosillo and engines in Chihuahua for export to the United States.

<P>
 U.S. investment in Latin America has increased steadily in recent years, 
rising even as capital from other countries fell, as it did in Brazil two years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>

in Chile was 49% of total accumulated foreign investment in 1989, but had 
shrunk to 39% of the total by June, 1994, as other countries increased 
investments there.

THE MELDING AMERICAS; EDUCATION; U.S. DEGREES OFTEN HOLD KEY TO TOP LATIN 
AMERICAN POSTS; GRADUATES' SHARED VIEW MAY BE WHY CLOSER RELATIONS AMONG 
HEMISPHERE'S NATIONS ARE SUCCEEDING WHERE EARLIER PLANS FAILED.

<P>
 The career path to Cabinet posts and boardrooms in Latin America increasingly 
leads through foreign education -- especially U.S. universities. 
</P>
<P>
 The last three Chilean treasury ministers have been graduates of U.S. schools. 
In Mexico, both President Carlos Salinas de Gortari and his predecessor, Miguel 
de la Madrid, attended Harvard. 
</P>
<P>
 The new generation that will lead their countries into the next century is 
made up of scholars like Colombia's 28-year-old vice minister of foreign trade, 
Mauricio Reina, who is a Johns Hopkins graduate. 
</P>
<P>
 The common experience of attending U.S. graduate schools has affected not only 
the Latin leaders' perception of their former host country, but also the way 
they relate to each other. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a broad consensus on certain key issues, a shared vision," said 
Terry McCoy, director of the Center for Latin American Studies at the 
University of Florida in Gainesville. "Not only do you know somebody, but you 
share a world view." 
</P>
<P>
 That shared view, experts say, is a major reason why the latest initiatives at 
closer relations in the Americas -- starting with the North American Free Trade 
Agreement -- appear to be succeeding where the Kennedy Administration's 
Alliance for Progress and FDR's Good Neighbor Policy failed. 
</P>
<P>
 Some caution is necessary, including the danger of exaggerating how much two 
years in the rarefied atmosphere of a top university really teaches a foreign 
student about U.S. culture. Still, whether government officials, business 
executives or scientists, Latin Americans eager for career advancement are 
coming under growing pressure to earn a foreign degree. 
</P>
<P>
 "We expect that if someone earns a doctorate here, he will go to a foreign 
university for a post-doctorate," said Marcos Moshinsky, a noted Mexican 
physicist. 
</P>
<P>
 In government, the incentive is clear: 59% of Mexico's current Cabinet 
ministers, undersecretaries and chiefs of staff did postgraduate work abroad, 
compared to one-fourth two decades ago. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, more than 3,000 students from Mexico are now studying in the 
United States. That is a remarkable contrast from the level two generations ago 
when only the wealthiest Latin Americans could aspire to a foreign degree. 
</P>
<P>
 The change occurred largely because Latin American governmental agencies -- 
mainly central banks -- began offering graduate fellowships to bright young 
bureaucrats in the early 1960s, principally in economics. One of the best 
investments Venezuela made with its oil bonanza is considered to be the money 
put into fellowships for foreign study. 
</P>
<P>
 The foreign-trained economists went into government and onto university 
faculties when they returned home. At first, the young Turks faced an uphill 
battle in their efforts to introduce free-market economic reforms, said Sergio 
Ghigliazza, director of the organization of Latin American central banks and a 
Yale graduate. 
</P>
<P>
 Then the Third World debt crisis of the 1980s discredited the old economic 
theories at the same time that foreign-educated economists were reaching the 
point in their careers that they could have a significant influence on public 
policy. 
</P>
<P>
 University of Chicago graduates turned Chile into a laboratory for the 
monetarist theories of their mentor, Milton Friedman. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yale probably exerted more influence over economic policy in Mexico than any 
other foreign institution," said Roderic Camp, a Tulane University professor 
who has compiled a biographical dictionary of influential Mexicans. 
</P>
<P>
 The governor of Mexico's central bank, a former treasury minister and 
President-elect Ernesto Zedillo, who is also a former budget minister, are 
among the key figures in the Mexican government who attended Yale. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout Latin America, foreign-trained economists began negotiating the 
debt deals that included economic adjustments with the free-market reforms they 
had been advocating all along. At the same time, young executives whose 
corporations and families had sent them to the United States for MBAs began 
taking over businesses. The result was a radical change of view about how 
government, businesses and countries in general should be run. 
</P>
<P>
 "Based on hundreds of interviews, I can say that Mexicans in general feel that 
education played a critical role in their values, not only the books they read, 
but their contacts with students and professors outside the classroom," Camp 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Colombian sociologist Agustin Lombana recalled his graduate study at Stanford 
as crucial to his view of life. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought I was going there to obtain formulas to use for the rest of my 
professional life," said Lombana, who now represents the Fulbright program in 
Colombia. "Instead, I was left with a series of questions. After five months at 
Stanford, I felt overwhelmed by research in a field that I thought I had 
mastered. This shook me out of static thought into dynamic thought." 
</P>
<P>
 That sort of experience is why graduate study abroad has affected Latin 
leaders so profoundly, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can easily access the Harvard library on Infonet," Lombana explained, 
"but that is not the same as living the reality of a foreign culture." 
</P>
<P>
 However, Wayne Cornelius, director of the Center for U.S.-Mexican Studies at 
UC San Diego, cautioned that the reality for foreign graduate students is often 
quite insular. 
</P>
<P>
 "They come to the United States to acquire a tool kit that will enable them to 
advance professionally back home," he said. "That doesn't necessarily translate 
into a better understanding of the United States." In fact, he added, "what 
they could have learned by osmosis may actually be quite wide of the mark."  
</P>
<P>
 Most of the potential Latin leaders who have attended the San Diego center's 
summer seminar in U.S. studies over the last six years had already completed 
graduate work in the United States, Cornelius added. Nevertheless, he said, 
"it's always very interesting to me to see the scales falling from the eyes as 
people find they harbor a set of stereotypes they weren't aware of until they 
began a rigorous course of academic work." 
</P>
<P>
 However, Arcadio Diaz-Quinones, former director of Latin American studies at 
Princeton, is worried that the young Latin scholars also become alienated from 
their own culture. 
</P>
<P>
 "This creates an international professional culture that allows for 
understanding between (leaders in different) countries," he said. "But they end 
up talking to each other, not the people they represent. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a danger of establishing a new elite," he said, "of widening the gap 
between the elite and the people." 
</P>
<P>
 If Diaz-Quinones is right, there is a scramble among Latin American students 
to make sure they land on the elite side of the gap by studying abroad.

THE MELDING AMERICAS; 'SPANGLISH' MIRRORS HYBRID CULTURE ON U.S.-MEXICAN 
BORDER; THE INCURSION OF ENGLISH INTO SPANISH HAS BEEN DRIVEN BY TELEVISION AND 
MIGRATION.

<P>
 Near the line where cultures collide, furtive men hang out at phone booths 
along San Ysidro Boulevard, a teeming strip of brightly colored Mexican 
restaurants, shops and currency exchanges that seems a northern mirror of 
Tijuana. 
</P>
<P>
 The men are daredevil drivers-for-hire who take illegal immigrants on the 
fateful trek to Los Angeles: a raite , it is called -- a ride. And the drivers 
are known as raiteros.  
</P>
<P>
 Adapted English words such as these are common among Spanish-speakers in 
Southern California barrios and Mexican border cities, cropping up even in 
official reports of the Baja state judicial police. The border buzzes with 
terms that Miguel de Cervantes never used in "Don Quixote" -- lonche (lunch), 
dompe (dump), yonke (junk). Some Tijuanans also indulge in idiomatic 
concoctions such as dame un quebrazo (give me a break). 
</P>
<P>
 "Spanglish" has a long history in northern Mexico, the American Southwest and 
Latino urban centers such as Miami. The epic convergence of people and cultures 
at the California-Mexico border provides fertile ground for its continued 
growth. The linguistic frontier is being reshaped by Oaxacan migrant vendors 
and Chicano poets, by wealthy Mexico City matrons with vacation homes in La 
Jolla and Tijuana graffiti artists in baggy jeans. Los baggies . 
</P>
<P>
 Fran Ilich is on the vanguard. 
</P>
<P>
 Only 18, he is a slender and feisty journalist, filmmaker, aspiring novelist 
and leader of a restless generation of Tijuana youths who epitomize 
trans-border culture. They speak a playful, convoluted patois of Spanish 
peppered with hip English expressions: los taggers, los punks, los hardcoreros, 
los raves and underground, coffeehouse, fliers, wanna-bes, posers, get-a-life.  
</P>
<P>
 Ilich founded a multimedia group of poets, photographers, disc jockeys and 
other guerrilla artists known as "Counter-culture." He also runs with Fool 
Krew, one of dozens of rebellious teen-age groups from Tijuana that have 
drenched the contiguous border cities in bilingual graffiti. 
</P>
<P>
 "What do I have to do with Mexico City or Sinaloa, if I spent my life shopping 
here at Ralphs and Safeway?" Ilich asked, slurping a Coke at a Jack-in-the-Box 
in San Ysidro. "Before being Mexican, I am from Tijuana. Taggers, raves, techno 
-- those are words you can't translate. I have to like this transculturation, 
this hybrid language: That's what I am." 
</P>
<P>
 The incursion of English into Spanish has been driven by television and 
migration, according to sociologist Jose Manuel Valenzuela Arce of the Cultural 
Center of Tijuana. 
</P>
<P>
 "The mobility and the migration at this end of the century are making the 
cultural interaction more intense," he said. "That doesn't mean we are entering 
the era of globalized culture as some have said, but rather that people can 
more easily construct and re-create cultural codes that circulate with enormous 
rapidity across borders. . . . What we are seeing now is the expansion of the 
limits of the border." 
</P>
<P>
 For example, the once-insular, hybrid slang of subcultures such as Los 
Angeles' zoot-suited pachucos of the 1940s and today's cholo gang members has 
spread to regions and social classes far beyond their origins, Valenzuela said. 
Meanwhile, the advent of computer technology has introduced a host of English 
technical terms into everyday Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
 And some efforts of U.S. officialdom to communicate with Spanish speakers have 
added to a glossary of occasionally comical linguistic deformities. In 1992, 
the Phoenix International Airport posted bilingual signs attempting to warn 
that "Violators will be fined." The signs declared " Violadores seran finados " 
-- which means "Rapists will be deceased." 
</P>
<P>
 On the Mexican side of the international line, the onslaught of English has 
raised worries about cultural colonization. The government has launched some 
elaborate campaigns in defense of the language. Many border denizens do not 
want to be defended, however. 
</P>
<P>
 "The border has its own very healthy culture based precisely on the clash, the 
disparity of the two cultures, which in a way end up complementing each other," 
said Miguel Escobar, a novelist from the border state of Sonora who works as 
press attache at the Mexican Consulate in Los Angeles. "It is a cultural 
phenomenon that has a certain appeal." 
</P>
<P>
 Valenzuela, the Tijuana sociologist, draws a comparison to the profound Arab 
influence in medieval Spain; about a quarter of Spanish words today are of Arab 
origin, from Ole , the familiar bullfight cheer, to the incongruously elegant 
word for sewer: alcantarilla . He argues that the influx of Spanglish similarly 
enriches the language. 
</P>
<P>
 "Otherwise, the language becomes a museum piece," he said. "All languages have 
evolved like this. The idea is to have more words and richer and more intense 
social relations." 
</P>
<P>
 English has had a more intense impact on Spanish than vice versa. Exceptions 
include phrases immortalized by mainstream icons: Arnold Schwarzenegger's 
"Terminator 2" salutation, " Hasta la vista , baby," and the occasional 
exclamation of " Ay caramba !" from Bart Simpson, whose likeness is sold at the 
Tijuana tourist crossing dressed in a sombrero and serape. 
</P>
<P>
 But Valenzuela said the growing immigrant community in the United States is 
making its linguistic presence felt, as reflected among some U.S. Latinos whose 
primary language is English. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider the irreverent pages of Pocho Magazine. An often-pejorative term used 
to refer to Americanized Chicanos, the word pocho derives from a Sinaloan 
expression that means being cut off from one's roots, Valenzuela said. 
</P>
<P>
 However, as presented in the magazine, which is written by a group of young 
Chicano comics, the word becomes a satirical and defiant celebration. A recent 
issue features Gov. Pete Wilson being deported to Europe for "crimes against la 
raza ," outgoing and bright-domed Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari 
promoting the "Latino Hair Club for Men" and an intrepid gossip columnist known 
as El Juicy. 
</P>
<P>
 The language is gleeful, Spanish-filled pocho English: the wave of the future?

THE MELDING AMERICAS; LANGUAGE; TO GET AHEAD, U.S. LEARNS TO SPEAK UP -- IN 
SPANISH; AS COMMERCIAL TIES STRENGTHEN, FLUENCY IS VALUED AS A MAJOR BUSINESS 
ASSET. STUDY PROGRAMS HAVE BURGEONED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM R. LONG, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 U.S. banker James R. Callahan has lived in Chile for 14 years and feels at 
ease in both business and social settings. It helps that he speaks Spanish 
fluently. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's extremely important, because unless you're able to speak the 
language you miss some of the nuances -- it tends to be a little bit more 
stilted," Callahan said. "You limit yourself if you don't speak the language." 
</P>
<P>
 As U.S. business with Latin America expands and the Latino population in the 
United States also grows, Americans are paying closer attention to signs that 
say Se Habla Espanol. "Spanish Spoken Here." 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. commercial ties with Mexico are burgeoning under the North American Free 
Trade Agreement, and similar pacts with other Latin American countries are 
expected in the future. The United States will be linking its livelihood more 
closely to a community of 19 countries and 300 million people, from the Rio 
Grande to Cape Horn, who share the common bond of the Spanish language. And the 
155 million Brazilians speak Portuguese, a close linguistic cousin of Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
 In the United States, there are an estimated 24 million Latinos, 7.7 million 
of them in California. If Americans who learned Spanish as a second language 
are added, the total number of U.S. Spanish-speakers is estimated at 30 million 
or more. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who learn Spanish -- at home, in the classroom or on the street -- are 
acquiring one of the world's four most-spoken tongues, one of vivid 
expressiveness and rich cultural tradition. Worldwide, about 370 million people 
speak Spanish, most of them in this hemisphere. Only Mandarin, Hindi and 
English are spoken more widely. Writers of Spanish have won 10 Nobel Prizes for 
literature. "Don Quixote de la Mancha," written by Spain's Miguel de Cervantes 
in the early 17th Century, is recognized as one of the greatest novels ever 
written in any language. 
</P>
<P>
 For Callahan, the First National Bank of Boston's vice president and general 
manager in Chile, Spanish is a cultural and social attribute and also a major 
business asset. He took private language classes in the United States and was 
able to speak and understand Spanish when he came to Chile with his family in 
1980 as a junior lending officer. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I first came down here, there was another American who was here before I 
was, the commercial manager," Callahan recalled in an interview. "Within a year 
and three months I had replaced him, because he was learning how to speak 
Spanish but he didn't feel comfortable enough in Spanish to invite clients in 
for lunches and things like that. As soon as I arrived I started inviting 
people in for lunches, and he would attend but he couldn't really keep up. It 
was a real big factor, I think." 
</P>
<P>
 Other Americans obviously agree. Inmaculada de Habsburgo, director of the 
Spanish Institute in New York City, said demand is high for the institute's 
private language classes. "We have a lot of professional people who want to 
speak Spanish, because they need it professionally, you know, so we have 
lawyers, we have bankers," Habsburgo said in a telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would think the NAFTA treaty has woken up a lot of people," she said. "They 
see now that they are going to be doing more commerce, not only with Mexico but 
with the whole of Latin America." 
</P>
<P>
 David Gies, a professor of Spanish at the University of Virginia, observed 
that Spanish is increasingly important, not only for international commerce in 
the hemisphere but also for working in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "The U.S. Census Office predicts that by the year 2010, Hispanics will surpass 
any other group as this country's largest minority," Gies said. "They are also 
predicting that by the year 2020 there will be 51 million Spanish speakers in 
the United States." 
</P>
<P>
 Gies, who heads the university's department of Spanish, Italian and 
Portuguese, said that a generation or two ago, French and German were the most 
popular foreign languages in U.S. classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those were the languages that one was told to study in high school and 
college because those were the useful languages, the languages of international 
intellectual discourse," he said. "Well, that has just changed radically. 
French across the country is way, way down, and Spanish is way up. 
</P>
<P>
 "And that isn't because we're sitting in high schools and colleges demanding 
that people take Spanish. The people are coming to us and saying, 'Hey, look, 
this is the language we need to learn, this is the language we want to learn.' 
" 
</P>
<P>
 The American Council on the Teaching of Foreign Languages reported that 2.6 
million middle and high school students in the country were taking Spanish 
classes in 1990. A survey by the Modern Language Assn. the same year found that 
534,000 U.S. university students were studying Spanish -- up 40% from 1983 -- 
accounting for nearly half of all college students registered for foreign 
language courses. 
</P>
<P>
 Lynn Samdstedt, president of the American Assn. of Teachers of Spanish and 
Portuguese, predicted more growth in future surveys. 
</P>
<P>
 "You'll see a marked increase in the number of students in both the high 
school and university studying Spanish because the demand is becoming much 
greater," said Samdstedt, who teaches at the University of Northern Colorado in 
Greeley. 
</P>
<P>
 As Spanish-language studies have burgeoned in the United States, so has 
English instruction in Latin America. In many grade schools and high schools 
around the region, English classes are obligatory. And private academies 
dedicated solely to teaching English have proliferated. There are an estimated 
100 such schools in the Mexican city of Monterrey, a business hub 140 miles 
south of the Texas border, but there are also dozens in cities as far away as 
Santiago and Buenos Aires. 
</P>
<P>
 Most Americans already have a start on Spanish. Buenos dias. Tacos, por favor. 
Muy bueno. Gracias. Adios. Who doesn't know those words? And cognates are easy: 
rapido, familia, terrorista, metal, sexo. Such words mean the same as their 
English look-alikes, and the list is long. But to learn a language well 
requires a great deal of study and practice, and that includes Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
 Many Americans mistakenly consider Spanish to be a simple, inelegant language, 
according to Samdstedt. "It's because we suffer from an ignorance of the 
Spanish culture," he said. "Very few people in this country know of the great 
literary works that came out of Spain and have come out of Mexico and South 
America over the past years, literary works that compete favorably, certainly, 
with the other great literature of the other countries of the world." 
</P>
<P>
 But more and more Americans are aware that Spanish is a practical language, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The practicality of the language, when they can see that it's going to help 
them earn a living in the future, is one of the things drawing students to 
this," he said. "It's happening in communications, it's happening in business, 
it's happening in medicine and nursing. The need for bilingual doctors and 
nurses in this country is increasing daily." 
</P>
<P>
 Samdstedt and Gies both said that increased knowledge of Spanish in the United 
States will translate into greater understanding of Latin America and stronger 
hemispherical ties. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course we're going to get closer," Gies said. "Because we are, you know, 
in a smaller world now, aren't we? We all talk about global economy, we all 
talk about diversity, we all talk about multiculturalism. And I think in fact 
that there's a fusion going on, a linguistic fusion across the 
northern-southern divide. And I think it's a healthy thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, many native speakers of Spanish in the United States are more 
interested than ever in preserving their cultural heritage, according to Odon 
Betanzos, director of the Academy of the Spanish Language in North America. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fifteen or 20 years ago there wasn't this concern for maintaining Spanish," 
Betanzos said by telephone from New York. "This concern started to become 
decisive in the last four or five years." 
</P>
<P>
 His theory is that a growing Latino middle class is behind the movement to 
preserve Spanish in the United States. "It is an incipient middle class, and it 
knows the value of bilingualism: A bilingual person is worth two," said 
Betanzos, a Spanish literature professor at City University of New York. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States now has more than 100 Spanish-language newspapers, 240 
Spanish-language radio stations and three Spanish-language television networks. 
These media are growing not only in quantity but also in quality, Betanzos 
said. "They serve as a nexus of union for the diverse Spanish-language 
communities -- this together with a very interesting phenomenon of an enormous 
number of Spanish-language cultural or political or social organizations." 
</P>
<P>
 Betanzos has a dream: "In about 20 or 30 years, Spanish could be the language 
for communication alongside English in the United States. Look where we are 
heading. This might be an immoderate ambition, but it is an ambition."

THE MELDING AMERICAS; CULTURE; AMERICAS PROVE THEY'RE NOT ALWAYS POLES APART; 
RODEOS ROPE BRAZILIAN HEARTS WHILE AMERICANS SWING TO LATIN BEATS. BUT THE 
EXCHANGE IS FAR FROM EVEN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The only thing missing was a Texas drawl or an Oklahoma Yee haw! because as 
far as American rodeos go, the thousands of Brazilians who had gathered at the 
exposition center here on a crisp Saturday night had almost everything else 
covered. 
</P>
<P>
 To the strains of Ricky Skaggs singing "Crying My Heart Out Over You," local 
riders bolted out of the chutes atop bucking broncos and twisting, snorting 
bulls with names like No Future. 
</P>
<P>
 Other cowboys, their leather chaps flapping, roped and wrestled steers to the 
ground, while cowgirls ran their mounts through the barrel races. 
</P>
<P>
 In the crowd, cowpoke wanna-bes were decked out in proper Western wear -- 
broad-brimmed hats, silver-buckled embroidered belts and Wrangler jeans (the 
special "Rodeo Endorsed" edition) that hung just so atop the Tony Lama boots. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who arrived without the proper accouterments needed only to mosey over 
to the Simpson Bros. Western Wear trailer. There, salesman Celso Marcello was 
happy to show them a pair of Justin boots, lead them through a variety of 
spurs, lariats and other Western paraphernalia -- "straight from Texas," he 
boasted in Portuguese -- or fit them into jeans that advertised, in English, 
the much-sought-after "cowboy cut." 
</P>
<P>
 And what cowboy would be complete without his chewing tobacco. Marcello 
offered both Beech-Nut and Skoal. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wild West, or at least the 20th-Century version of the uniquely North 
American phenomenon, had come to this mid-sized town tucked about 300 miles 
southwest of Sao Paulo. It was just one example of entwined cultures of the 
Americas. 
</P>
<P>
 From basketballs to soccer balls, Snoop Doggy Dogg to Julio Iglesias, 
McDonald's to Taco Bell, "True Lies" to "Like Water for Chocolate," the popular 
cultures of the two halves of the hemisphere have washed against each other, 
leaving their marks in obvious and not so obvious ways. 
</P>
<P>
 "You see it everywhere," said Carlao Andrade, owner of a Rio de Janeiro record 
company and recording studio that handles mainly American clients. "I go to the 
States, and I see things that are Brazilian or at least from Latin American 
countries. And here, you see the (U.S.) influence in almost everything." 
</P>
<P>
 Kindergartners at the Sierra Nevada school in Mexico City decorate their 
classrooms for Thanksgiving, while elementary students in New Orleans celebrate 
Mexican Independence Day. 
</P>
<P>
 American authors such as Stephen King and Sidney Sheldon are perennial best 
sellers in Latin American countries, while Brazilian Jorge Amado, Colombian 
Gabriel Garcia Marquez and Mexican Carlos Fuentes are renowned in U.S. literary 
circles. 
</P>
<P>
 In Latin America's two most populous nations -- Mexico and Brazil -- delivery 
boys hustle up and down city streets with red, white and blue Domino's Pizza 
boxes, just as they do in hundreds of U.S. cities. Meanwhile, Chilean families 
settle down to meals of empanadas , as do diners at the Las Pampas restaurant 
in Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
 The regions have even swapped slang. Hipsters in U.S. urban centers have long 
greeted each other casually with the phrase que pasa , while surfers in 
Portuguese-speaking Rio de Janeiro refer to each other as Bro. Hasta la vista , 
thanks in large part to Arnold Schwarzenegger, has become a household phrase in 
remote American towns such as Sylacauga, Ala., while throughout Latin America 
OK is a universal term of approval. 
</P>
<P>
 Each hemispherical pole influences the other, but the exchange is far from 
even. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite a long history of Latin influence in the United States that includes 
Afro-Cuban music in the 1930s, Mexican mural painting in the 1940s, Brazilian 
bossa nova in the 1950s and South and Central American architectural styles 
throughout the century, Latin culture in America is still for the most part 
segregated in the communities of Spanish-speaking immigrants or naturalized 
Latino citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, while music by American pop stars is routinely mixed into the 
radio formats of salsa and samba in South and Central America, Latin-influenced 
music in the United States is primarily limited to Spanish-language radio 
stations. 
</P>
<P>
 American television programs, dubbed in Spanish or Portuguese, are routinely 
broadcast on Latin stations, but Latin-originated programming is almost never 
seen on English-language channels in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's true," said Broderic Camp, professor of Latin American studies and 
head of the political science department at Tulane University in New Orleans. 
"I don't think it's really directed at Latin American culture. It's just that 
in America we've always been more focused on ourselves than other cultures." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the cultural fertilization is far from being a one-way street, Camp 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fact is that Latin America has really replaced France as the most 
significant external cultural influence in the United States," he said. The 
most obvious areas are art, food and music. 
</P>
<P>
 "The (Latin) music is now so entwined with most popular music that you can't 
be a real musician today without understanding Latin rhythms," said drummer 
Ndugu Chancler, who has played with artists from Miles Davis to Carlos Santana. 
"And not only that, you have to be able to differentiate between Afro-Cuban and 
Brazilian rhythms." 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, U.S. culture has made a far greater impact in the hemisphere, as 
evidenced by the rodeo trappings in the Brazilian interior. There, pickup 
trucks are the rage. Local discos play country music, both American and an 
American-influenced Brazilian brand called caipiria .  
</P>
<P>
 The onslaught of things North American has been fueled by the pervasive 
presence of U.S. television programs, movies and a rapidly growing fast-food 
franchise industry that fosters the American way of life. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout Latin America, which has minuscule film industries, American movies 
are the staple, representing at least 80% of the market. Of the top 50 video 
rentals in Brazil last year, for example, only one was not a U.S.-made film. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our movies do sell America and an American way of life, both the good and the 
bad " said Harry Stone, senior vice president for the Motion Picture Assn. of 
America, with offices in Rio de Janeiro.  
</P>
<P>
 And South Americans are regular TV watchers of "Cheers," "Golden Girls," "L.A. 
Law," "Star Trek: Deep Space Nine," "Baywatch" and American sports. 
</P>
<P>
 American music has flooded into Latin America via radio and MTV. Aerosmith is 
ranked in the Top 10 in Peru and Argentina; Toni Braxton holds a Top 10 spot in 
Chile.  
</P>
<P>
 "The music changed the way people wanted to dress, the way they walk, the way 
they talk," said Johnny Pereira, who programs American music for a dozen 
Brazilian radio stations. "You've got Brazilian rappers, just everything." 
</P>
<P>
 The influx has been met with mixed feelings. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's good and bad," said Laura Cerrato, a professor of literature at the 
University of Buenos Aires. "What we get is the most mediocre of American 
literature, Stephen King and Sidney Sheldon. We get Michael Jackson and 
Madonna, but we don't get some of the better music or better literature. At 
least in America the buyer gets a chance to choose." 
</P>
<P>
 "The good," Mexican author Homero Aridjis said, "is that the American 
political culture, with its democracy and division of powers, is an impressive 
model for freedom."  
</P>
<P>
 But like many, Aridjis worries that Latin America will be drowned by the 
American cultural wave: "The Mexican culture is losing its own identity and 
imitating American standards of life and culture due to the invasion of 
American TV and films. America exports its violence and consumerism. . . . 
Mexican youth watch these shows and want to go out and imitate what they see. . 
. . It's a tough issue. The question is whether we can prevent American culture 
from killing off our own."

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: PUBLIC HEALTH PANEL OPPOSES PROP. 187 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Ventura County Public Health Community Advisory Board has voted to oppose 
Proposition 187, charging that passage of the November ballot initiative would 
jeopardize the health of all Californians by allowing the spread of disease. 
</P>
<P>
 The so-called Save Our State measure would deny most public services, 
including public health care, to illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 "The underlying principle about communicable diseases is that you have to 
protect the entire population," Chairwoman Barbara Thorpe said. "If you take a 
segment of the population and say we're not going to protect them, then the 
rest of the population becomes endangered." 
</P>
<P>
 Thorpe said the likelihood of measles and tuberculosis outbreaks would 
increase if illegal immigrants were denied immunization and that such outbreaks 
would not be limited to illegal immigrants.  
</P>
<P>
 "Bugs don't respect boundaries," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The board's resolution, passed unanimously at its meeting Thursday, also 
warned that "Proposition 187 would turn our doctors, nurses and teachers into 
INS agents and our hospitals and schools into immigration offices." IRA E.

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: SCHOOLS REJECT CLAIM BY FIRED PRINCIPAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAIA DAVIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Opening the way for a potential lawsuit, the Ventura County Board of Education 
on Monday rejected a $3-million claim from a former principal who was fired 
after challenging the county schools chief for his job in the June election. 
</P>
<P>
 The board voted unanimously in closed session not to pay the claim by Dan 
Flynn. 
</P>
<P>
 Flynn, who was fired effective July 1, filed the claim last week, demanding $3 
million in financial damages from county school officials and additional 
punitive damages from county Supt. of Schools Charles Weis. 
</P>
<P>
 Flynn said last week that he would file a lawsuit if county school officials 
reject his claim. 
</P>
<P>
 Citing poor job performance, Weis fired Flynn three weeks after the June 7 
election in which Flynn had run against Weis for the job of superintendent. The 
timing sparked charges from Flynn and some of his supporters that the firing 
was politically motivated.  
</P>
<P>
 Flynn had worked for three years as principal of the county's three schools 
for youths who are in jail or juvenile hall. The position paid $62,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Since his firing, Flynn has worked as a temporary administrator for the Los 
Angeles County Education Office in Downey. Although Flynn has said this 
position pays more than his previous job, it has no benefits, and it ends 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Flynn has claimed that publicity over his firing has hurt his 
chances at getting other employment. MAIA DAVIS

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: WOMAN PRAISED FOR SAVING BOY FROM DOG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A teen-age baby-sitter who stopped a family dog mauling a 6-year-old Ventura 
boy will be cited for bravery by the Ventura City Firefighters Assn., a fire 
official said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "She put herself aside just to save the child," said Fire Engineer Vern 
Alstot, the acting fire captain whose company responded to the call Saturday 
afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 He said Rachel Szatkowski, 19, of Simi Valley pulled the 75-pound Akita off 
Geoffrey Landry while the dog was attacking him in his back yard in the 6800 
block of Norton Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Geoffrey, who suffered severe lacerations to his face and head, was in fair 
condition Monday at Ventura County Medical Center, a hospital spokeswoman said. 
He underwent extensive surgery Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1-year-old male dog, who had bitten a 26-year-old woman at the same house 
in February, was given to Ventura County Animal Shelter workers by the boy's 
father on Saturday and then euthanized, shelter director Kathy Jenks said. The 
animal's brain was sent to a laboratory Monday for rabies tests. 
</P>
<P>
 Szatkowski, who was bitten on the left forearm and wrist, had seen the boy 
leading the dog across the back yard by the collar, looked away for a moment 
and then turned back when she heard the attack, Alstot said. 
</P>
<P>
 The dog had pinned the boy on his back and was biting him when Szatkowski 
rushed outside and pulled the animal away, Alstot said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The child did amazingly well," he added. "He remained quite brave through the 
whole incident." 
</P>
<P>
 Szatkowski will be honored with a letter of commendation, Alstot said. 
</P>
<P>
 Originally bred in Japan, the Akita has long been valued as a fighting dog in 
the Far East and can be aggressive, Jenks said. GREG RIPPEE

CHANDLER SITTING PRETTY; RAMS: HE APPEARS TO HAVE EARNED THE STARTING JOB OVER 
MILLER WITH VICTORY OVER THE CHIEFS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Chuck Knox, who gave his players Monday off for "maybe only the second time" 
in his 21 years as a head coach, will maintain the suspense until Wednesday: 
Who will be the starting quarterback against the Atlanta Falcons? 
</P>
<P>
 Best guess: Chris Chandler. 
</P>
<P>
 Chandler, who signed for $600,000 to be a backup quarterback this season, 
played mistake-free football -- that's Chuck Knox football -- Sunday in leading 
the Rams to a 16-0 victory over the Chiefs in Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would rate his performance as a top performance," Knox said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams gave a $9-million, three-year contract to Chris Miller to leave 
Atlanta and become their starting quarterback, but Miller hurt his ribs and 
then suffered a pinched nerve in his shoulder after guiding the team to a 1-2 
start. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller's ribs are fine now, Knox said, and Monday Miller showed up at Rams 
Park to play catch with wide receiver Richard Buchanan. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's improving," Knox said. "He had the pinched nerve in his shoulder and the 
numbness and tingling down his arm. He had some swelling . . . but it's 
subsided. Obviously the arm is not as strong as it will be after he gets some 
work in to build the strength back up." 
</P>
<P>
 Chandler, however, is healthy and he is the quarterback who guided the Rams, 
two-touchdown underdogs, to victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "The quarterback was something special," cornerback Todd Lyght said. "He 
showed a lot of leadership out there and played just a great game." 
</P>
<P>
 Chandler completed 13 of 21 passes for 207 yards, including a 72-yard 
touchdown pass to Flipper Anderson. None of his passes were intercepted, and 
was sacked only once despite playing behind reserves Wayne Gandy and Chuck 
Belin. 
</P>
<P>
 "He made the right decisions," Knox said. "He threw the ball away when he 
didn't have the open receiver and he eluded the rush." 
</P>
<P>
 Knox has always admired Chandler from afar, and he was the one who pushed the 
organization into signing him during the off-season when Jack Trudeau was also 
on the list for consideration. 
</P>
<P>
 After Miller injured his ribs, he required three pain-killing injections to 
play against the Falcons. He took an additional shot before the team's game 
with San Francisco, and at that time Knox began to become seriously concerned 
with his starting quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller injured his shoulder against the 49ers and then kept the extent of his 
injury secret from Knox during the third quarter. That irritated Knox. A few 
days later, Knox announced that Chandler would start against the Chiefs, and 
some suggested the switch might not be temporary. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller, however, insisted last week that he would be ready for this week's 
game, because after all it would be against his former employers. 
</P>
<P>
 Will such a circumstance influence Knox's decision? 
</P>
<P>
 "No," Knox said. 
</P>
<P>
 What will his decision be based on? 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll make the decision based on what affords us the best opportunity to win 
the football game," Knox said. 
</P>
<P>
 Presently, that's Chandler, who has gained the confidence of his peers while 
standing tall at 1-0 as a starting quarterback for the Rams. In the locker room 
after Sunday's game there was almost universal unsolicited praise for Chandler. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller, meanwhile, is still hurting. After throwing the ball with remarkable 
accuracy in training camp, Miller struggled in the last few exhibition games 
and then went into a tailspin when the games began to count. 
</P>
<P>
 His arm, as Knox pointed out, lacks the strength it would normally have, and 
who is going to mess with success? Miller was completing 43.6% of his passes 
before being sent to the sideline, and while he has the same number of 
touchdown passes as Chandler -- two -- he has four more interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
 A year ago at this time, the Rams were parked in the same situation, with Jim 
Everett coming off a splendid game. The Rams were 2-2 after upsetting Houston 
in the Astrodome. However, the team collapsed at home against New Orleans and 
lost, 37-6, and went on to lose four more games before finishing 5-11. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike last year, however, Knox gave his team Monday off after shocking the 
opposition. 
</P>
<P>
 "The reason this thing came about is because we found out that Kansas City 
would get an extra day off if they won," Knox said. "I just told my guys we 
would level the playing field and play for the same thing. They were ecstatic 
about it. They were in the locker room chanting, 'Two days off.' It's just 
something you do . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 So there's the secret, the motivation to push the Rams around the corner, a 
Monday off following each victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "No, no," Knox said. "I didn't say that." 
</P>
<P>
 It's still early in the week.

BLOOD FEUD?; HARDLY, BUT AS SHULAS PREPARE FOR MEETING OF COACHES DON, DAVE, 
FAMILY COMES SECOND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 This landmark meeting between a father and a son will be celebrated, 
fittingly, with a reunion. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday at the son's house in suburban Cincinnati, three generations of 
Shulas will gather to hug and laugh about football and life. 
</P>
<P>
 They will talk about a first game, the son's, when he was 5 and watched his 
father's team lose an NFL championship game. 
</P>
<P>
 The son said it was then he realized the power of his father's sport, because 
it was the first time he had seen grown men cry. 
</P>
<P>
 They will talk about a 484th game, the father's, the one in which he became 
the winningest coach in NFL history. 
</P>
<P>
 Watching the highlights on television, the son saw a grown man cry on that day 
too. 
</P>
<P>
 It will be a night rich in emotion. But before the memories have slowed to a 
trickle, somebody will undoubtedly note that someone is missing. 
</P>
<P>
 That someone will be the father. 
</P>
<P>
 Laying the ground rules for the first professional sports meeting between 
father and son head coaches, Don Shula said that he would skip the niceties and 
concentrate on the game Sunday night between his Miami Dolphins and son Dave's 
Cincinnati Bengals. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's got his team, I've got my team," Don said Monday. "I've got things I've 
always done with my team on Saturday, and that's not going to change." 
</P>
<P>
 So Barry Switzer of the Dallas Cowboys leaves the state on the night before a 
game to visit his son . . . and Shula won't even drive down the street? 
</P>
<P>
 This is different, Shula said. This is competition. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will be a proud and special day, but once the game starts, that is all 
I'll be thinking about," Don said. 
</P>
<P>
 And doesn't Dave know it. 
</P>
<P>
 Amid a losing streak that might well cost him his job, probably the worst 
person Dave Shula could face Sunday is his father. 
</P>
<P>
 No coach will prepare for it more. And no coach will want it as badly. 
</P>
<P>
 Renowned for his devotion to his five children -- he openly lobbied for a 
contract extension for Dave on Monday -- Don Shula is equally renowned for his 
devotion to winning. 
</P>
<P>
 This is a 64-year-old man who only plays doubles tennis against Dave, 35, if 
he can have Dave's wife, Leslie, as his partner. 
</P>
<P>
 "You see, she is pretty good," Dave said. 
</P>
<P>
 This is a man who has coached against teams employing his two sons five times 
in the NFL -- and never lost. 
</P>
<P>
 Four of those victories were against teams that had Dave as either a player or 
coach. The other was against son Mike, currently an assistant with the Chicago 
Bears. 
</P>
<P>
 He has outscored them, 129-69. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really enjoyed those games where I was on the other side of the field from 
him," Dave said wistfully. "Now, I'd like to find out what it's like to win one 
of them." 
</P>
<P>
 He needs that to happen Sunday, with his team winless in four games and his 
head coaching record at 8-28. 
</P>
<P>
 Bruce Coslet, the Bengals' new offensive coordinator, is waiting to take his 
job. Dwindling numbers of Bengal fans are waiting to embarrass him in front of 
a national TV audience. 
</P>
<P>
 And whom must he outsmart? A man who has won 322 more NFL games than he. 
</P>
<P>
 A man who has taught him everything. 
</P>
<P>
 The irony is not lost on the rest of the family, most of which is cheering for 
Dave. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a case of rooting for the one who needs it more -- and in this case, 
that's obvious," said Jim Shula, Don's brother. "This could be the game that 
puts Dave over the hump. This game will tell a lot about what his team thinks 
of him. If they think a lot of him, they will play hard." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Dave with a laugh: "There are no maybes about it. My three sisters are 
rooting for me and so is Mike. If he says he's not, well, he's not telling the 
truth." 
</P>
<P>
 Mike was a little more diplomatic. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm cheering for both of them -- I want that on the record," he said. "But, 
well, everybody knows my dad while Dave is a young guy. And everybody wants a 
young guy to do well." 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Shula laughed. "Actually, I don't think Don would fault us for cheering 
for Dave," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Don doesn't. 
</P>
<P>
 "All three of my daughters have dropped subtle hints," Don said. "They say, 
'Dad, I hope you understand, but we're pulling for Dave.' I told them I 
understand." 
</P>
<P>
 The only way both men will win, said Dave, is through the family values that 
the game will represent, and in the charitable donations that will be collected 
through the selling of commemorative footballs. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that this symbolism means Don's powerful Dolphins, who lost for the first 
time in four games Sunday, despite a 28-point comeback in Minnesota, are going 
to let up. "People have told me they thought that would happen, and I said, 
'Knowing Don, no way,' " Jim said. "Competition is what got him to this 
position. He can't change now." 
</P>
<P>
 That has become increasingly clear with each weekly phone call between father 
and son. 
</P>
<P>
 They usually talk on Tuesday mornings, and they usually talk about everything 
from football to the grandchildren. "But lately, the talk has sort of drifted 
away from football," Dave said. 
</P>
<P>
 And what will be discussed on that phone call this week? Is there even going 
to be a phone call this week? 
</P>
<P>
 Said Dave: "We'll probably talk this week just to touch base." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Don: "We may or may not touch base."

KINGS NOT EAGER TO DEAL WITH POSTPONEMENT; HOCKEY: TEAM IS HOPING TO MAKE FRESH 
START AFTER MISSING THE PLAYOFFS BY 16 POINTS LAST SEASON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 King owner Joseph M. Cohen had received his MBA from the Wharton School of 
Business at the University of Pennsylvania and reported to his new job at 
Madison Square Garden in 1970. One of his duties was dealing with the union. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, unions . 
</P>
<P>
 "Seventeen unions, and they were all separate unions," Cohen said. "It was one 
of my major things. Some of the guys I was negotiating with had worked for my 
dad. 
</P>
<P>
 "College didn't train me for that." 
</P>
<P>
 And it didn't train King General Manager Sam McMaster for his first labor 
experience, either. Before McMaster had decided to make hockey his career, he 
was a high school business teacher in Scarborough, Ontario, where he went 
through a teachers' strike. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was over 20 years ago," 
</P>
<P>
 McMaster said, shaking his head. "You had to picket. I didn't like it at all." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the two men come to the table with different labor experiences, they 
are, no surprise, firmly united behind NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman's threat 
of a postponement to the start of the season on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 There is much at stake for all NHL teams in this labor dispute, but the Kings, 
in particular, have been eager for a fresh start after missing the playoffs by 
a 16-point margin last season. 
</P>
<P>
 Cohen and co-owner Jeffrey P. Sudikoff have encountered obstacle after 
obstacle since agreeing to buy a majority interest in the Kings in December, 
1993. The sale took months to close and, at one point, Sudikoff and Cohen's two 
lenders -- insurance giants Cigna and Allstate -- became skittish about 
financing the deal and withdrew after announcement of a federal grand jury 
investigation into whether then-owner Bruce McNall has falsified loan 
documents. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the looming postponement represents another hurdle. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jeffrey and I are excited, we can't wait for the season to start," Cohen 
said. "We want the season to start on time. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remain the eternal optimist. I'm enjoying the exhibition season. We're 
seeing some of what we've done starting to take shape." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, as eager as Cohen and Sudikoff are for attention to return to the 
hockey rink, Cohen remains realistic about the rationale behind the decision to 
postpone the start of the season if there is no new collective bargaining 
agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lengthy lockout isn't good, but neither is a business that doesn't work," 
he said. " . . . The business has to work for everybody or something will go 
haywire. Gary is hopeful of an 80-game schedule. We hope to play the whole 
schedule." 
</P>
<P>
 The players have said they could have forced a showdown last spring but 
declined to take such action and that the sport had its most exciting and 
visible playoffs in years. 
</P>
<P>
 But Bettman and the owners have maintained that the NHL needs a long agreement 
in order to put the sport on a solid foundation, arguing against a revised 
collective bargaining agreement, saying they don't want to put another coat of 
paint on a window that has so much paint it has begun to peel. 
</P>
<P>
 "The business needs attention," Cohen said. "The players agree on that. . . . 
It needs some work. Expenses are rising faster than revenues. That's not a good 
thing." 
</P>
<P>
 There seems to be little visible acrimony between players and club management, 
in contrast to the players' 10-day strike in 1992. If anything, anger is 
directed at Bettman. 
</P>
<P>
 McMaster isn't taking anything personally, either, saying he had no problem 
with the King players, in a sign of union solidarity, shaking hands with the 
Rangers and the Penguins before games last week. 
</P>
<P>
 The King players, meanwhile, are bracing themselves for a long work stoppage. 
</P>
<P>
 "Like Wayne Gretzky said, it's not going to be a week, it'll be something like 
three or four months before it gets settled," right wing Rick Tocchet said. 
</P>
<P>
 Said right wing Tony Granato: "I'd be disappointed. A lot of people put their 
heart and soul into training camp. To have the season in jeopardy -- everyone 
is concerned. Mentally, it's been hard. You've got to put it out of your mind." 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Goodenow, executive director of the NHL Players Assn., traveled through 
Southern California last week and spoke to the Kings and Mighty Ducks. Some 
players around the league suggested that the union might accept salary limits 
for rookies, but none of the Kings have enrolled in that school of thought. 
</P>
<P>
 King goaltender Kelly Hrudey said that a rookie salary cap is unacceptable. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't believe in a salary cap in any way, shape or form in any occupation," 
Hrudey said. "It doesn't matter if you are in your first year." 
</P>

 Said defenseman Charlie Huddy: "I have only two, three years left. But a lot 
of this we're working for is for the younger guys. I could say, 'Forget it, I 
don't want to go (out).' You can't do stuff like that. Because this is helping 
out people down the road."

HICKS CLEARED TO MAKE RETURN FOR THE BRUINS; COLLEGE FOOTBALL: LEADING RUSHER 
FOR '93 TEAM WAS THOUGHT TO BE SIDELINED FOR SEASON AFTER SUFFERING KNEE INJURY 
LAST SPRING. 
</P>

<P>
 He's 19, and like many a teen-ager he hears what he wants to hear. Nobody is 
telling him he can't play , only that he shouldn't. Which to Skip Hicks means 
he should. 
</P>
<P>
 Hang conventional wisdom. Hang medical textbooks. Six months after surgery to 
reconstruct his left knee, he's set upon running the football against 
Washington on Saturday at Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
 He was released to full duty Monday by Gerald Finerman, UCLA's team physician, 
who had talked with the family. Everybody wants Hicks to sit out this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Everybody but Hicks. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I didn't feel I could do it, I wouldn't even try," the running back said. 
"Since everything is good, I want to give it a try. I really don't know how it 
will work out. I know it seems like it's doing really good. I want to prove it 
to myself." 
</P>
<P>
 His dad doesn't want to watch. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told him I probably wouldn't even look at it," Charles Hicks said. "I don't 
know if I could handle it. When he got hurt (a sprained ankle last season) in 
that Nebraska game, gosh, my wife looked at me and said, 'What's wrong with 
you?' I said, 'You don't understand, do you? I know just how he feels because 
I've been through it.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Charles Hicks set rushing records at Southwestern Oklahoma, then got a 
free-agent tryout with the Green Bay Packers that was cut short because he 
suffered a broken leg. 
</P>
<P>
 After a week with Winnipeg in the Canadian Football League, he suffered a 
broken shoulder. Another NFL try, that with the Houston Oilers, ended with 
another broken leg. 
</P>
<P>
 He has spent 21 years coaching high school football. Teen-agers are nothing 
new to him. His son is something else, though. 
</P>
<P>
 They have known this was coming since a rainy March 19, when Skip slipped on a 
wet long-jumping board in a track meet in Drake Stadium, then landed awkwardly 
in the damp pit. They simply didn't realize it would be so soon. 
</P>
<P>
 The knee was a total blow-out, and surgery was followed by the first stages of 
rehabilitation. Rather than keep him at UCLA for the summer, medical personnel 
put together a program for a sports rehabilitation center near Hicks' home in 
Wichita Falls, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
 The coaching staff wrote him off, revamping the offense to put emphasis on the 
passing game, figuring their leading rusher from 1993, with 563 yards as a 
freshman, was sidelined for the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Back home in north Texas, Hicks lifted weights during the summer. He ran on 
the grass and the track at Wichita Falls High and on the hills in Bridwell 
Park. He grunted and sweated when Steve Bailey, the center's physical trainer, 
pushed and pulled on the leg, seeking to restore its range of motion. 
</P>
<P>
 And that was the official program. 
</P>
<P>
 Unofficially, he was up at 5 a.m., running an hour before his father awakened. 
Weekends were spent playing pickup basketball at Midwestern University. Charles 
Hicks didn't find that out until a couple of weeks ago, after Skip had returned 
to UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told him I didn't want him playing basketball," Charles said. "He was still 
limping. They said they knocked him around pretty good, and one of his closest 
friends said he told them, 'If I want to get my leg back to normal, I'm going 
to have to forget about it and play like I always play.' " 
</P>
<P>
 William Breland, the rehabilitation center owner, was horrified when he found 
out about the basketball. 
</P>
<P>
 "His injury was as bad as it could be," Breland said. "You don't get a worse 
injury when you're a football player, but as it turned out, he actually 
improved almost too quickly for his own good. I know it was a bit frustrating 
during the summer because to some degree we had to temper things a bit. No 
matter how well you are going, you have to spend some time for the internal 
things to occur." 
</P>
<P>
 Have they occurred? 
</P>
<P>
 It's the question that dogs Coach Terry Donahue, Charles Hicks and everybody 
else involved in the case, including a medical staff that has put Skip Hicks 
through tests that seemed more like hurdles to determine if his left leg had 
healed. He has passed them all. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no question that he's 100%," Donahue said. "How can you tell somebody 
who's healthy that he can't play?" 
</P>
<P>
 It's not as if he didn't try. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not speaking out of school," Donahue said. "Skip knows exactly how I feel 
about it. I've strongly encouraged him not to play. I haven't told him that I'm 
going to hold him out. I don't think I should do that as a coach." 
</P>
<P>
 But he wouldn't mind if somebody else did it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I asked Skip the other night, because Donahue had asked me, if I told him not 
to play, would he play?" Charles Hicks said. "I told him I don't know. I would 
hate to tell him that because we've never been cross in his 19 years. . . . So 
I asked him the other night, 'Son, if I asked you not to play, would you play?' 
He said, 'No, Dad, I wouldn't, because you've always known best for me.' Then 
he said, 'I hope you don't ask me, though.' I told him, 'I'm not going to ask 
you then.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Said Skip: "My dad, he's kind of afraid. But I'm at the age to make my own 
decisions. I know he would prefer for me to sit out. He said he will hold his 
breath every time I carry the ball." 
</P>
<P>
 So will Donahue, who said Monday that Hicks would be worked back into the 
lineup quickly, sharing time with Sharmon Shah, who is third in the Pacific 10 
Conference in rushing with 453 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Hicks is not lacking in confidence. Said Charles Hicks: "He said, 'I was 
watching Nebraska and their defense wasn't near as good as it was last year. I 
could have run all over them.' " 
</P>
<P>
 A season ago, Skip rushed for 148 yards against Nebraska in a 14-13 UCLA 
defeat. This season he stood on the sideline, watching his teammates get beat, 
49-21. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel like I'm in better shape this year," Hicks said. 
</P>
<P>
 It remains to be seen. Or not seen, in the case of his father, who is plainly 
nervous. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told my wife I don't know what I would do if he were to get out there and 
re-injure himself and I could have had something to do with not letting him 
play," Charles Hicks said. 
</P>
<P>
 Donahue will be closer than a Wichita Falls, Tex., living room. He will hold 
his breath every time Hicks carries. 
</P>
<P>
 "But you know what?" he said. "There is some truth in that I would be doing 
the same thing if he waited until next season."

TALKS PRODUCE NO SIGNS OF PROGRESS; HOCKEY: BETTMAN SAYS HE WILL DECIDE FRIDAY 
WHETHER TO POSTPONE SATURDAY'S SCHEDULED SEASON OPENERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Talks between the NHL and its players' union Monday in Toronto produced no 
signs of progress, increasing the likelihood that Commissioner Gary Bettman 
will delay Saturday's scheduled season openers. 
</P>
<P>
 Bettman, who said last week he would not allow the season to start unless a 
collective bargaining agreement had been negotiated, said he will decide 
"sometime on Friday" whether to postpone the 12 games to be played on the first 
night of the NHL's 78th season. Teams normally travel the morning or afternoon 
before road games and would need notice to cancel or alter plane and hotel 
reservations. 
</P>
<P>
 A source close to the negotiations said that because such significant 
disagreements remain, those involved were "not too optimistic" after Monday's 
five-hour session that the season will begin as planned. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is very clear we have a wide difference of opinion," said Bob Goodenow, 
executive director of the NHL Players Assn. "I think unless there is 
flexibility, there will be a serious problem. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "We will not be pressured into any kind of an agreement because of a pending 
lockout. It will work itself out and whatever course it takes, it takes." 
</P>
<P>
 Each side's labor lawyers met Monday before they convened en masse for what 
Goodenow called a group discussion. They will meet again today at the NHLPA's 
offices. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're in better shape than if I said we've broken up and gone back to New 
York," Bettman said. "We're working very hard. . . . I'm not interested in a 
Band-Aid solution. The future of this league depends on a new collective 
bargaining agreement." 
</P>
<P>
 He repeated that he considers an entirely new agreement vital, and would not 
allow the season to begin under the terms of the last agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 The key differences are the NHL's desire to impose salary controls, both in 
the form of a scale for players with limited time in the league and in the form 
of a payroll limit linked to each club's revenues. Clubs that exceed the limit 
would pay a "luxury tax" that would be used to subsidize small-market clubs 
with fewer financial resources. 
</P>
<P>
 Players oppose salary limits in any form. They have proposed a 5% levy on 
clubs' payrolls and gate receipts, with the proceeds also helping small-market 
clubs. They are also advocating greater free agency and the re-establishment of 
salary arbitration, which was eliminated by Bettman in a wide-ranging preseason 
edict.

HOUSTON, EX-MCNALL ACCOUNTANT, WILL PLEAD GUILTY, ATTORNEY SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Robert J. Houston, a former accountant for King president Bruce McNall, will 
plead guilty to single counts of conspiracy, bank fraud and wire fraud, 
according to his attorney, David Reed. 
</P>
<P>
 Houston, who sources said has been cooperating with the government 
investigation, is accused of filing false tax returns and financial statements 
to help McNall obtain more than $150 million in loans. Appearing on Monday 
before U.S. Magistrate Judge George King, Houston pleaded not guilty, but Reed 
told King that his client is "going to enter a guilty plea." 
</P>
<P>
 King set a trial date of Nov. 22 before U.S. District Judge J. Spencer Letts. 
However, Reed indicated that the plea would come before then. Houston is the 
second McNall business associate charged in a federal bank loan fraud 
investigation, one of about a dozen former McNall business associates known to 
have been negotiating pleas.  
</P>
<P>
 Assistant U.S. Attorney Peter G. Spivack will ask that the Houston case be 
transferred to U.S. District Judge Richard Paez, who already has heard the 
guilty plea of Joanna Orehek. Orehek, former vice president and controller of 
McNall's chief holding company, pleaded guilty last month to conspiracy, wire 
fraud and aiding and abetting. Her sentencing is scheduled for Jan. 30. 
</P>
<P>
 Houston was accused in court papers of being part of a group of McNall 
officials who, for the past eight years, fraudulently obtained loans by 
inflating McNall's income, overstating his assets and understating or omitting 
previous loans. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal officials allege that the fraudulent documents, as well as a group of 
sham companies, enabled McNall officials to get money for horse and coin 
operations as well as a $60-million business loan and a $20-million personal 
loan from Bank of America. Among the financial institutions prosecutors named 
as victims were Bank of America, Bank of California, First Los Angeles Bank, 
Union Bank and the French bank Credit Lyonnais.

SURGERY NOT PLANNED FOR RAVELING; COLLEGE BASKETBALL: USC COACH IS LISTED IN 
STABLE CONDITION AS HE RECOVERS FROM INJURIES SUFFERED IN CRASH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 USC basketball Coach George Raveling was in stable condition and not expected 
to need surgery for injuries he suffered in a traffic accident Sunday, 
according to Demetrios Demetriades, trauma director at USC University Hospital 
and professor of surgery at USC. 
</P>
<P>
 "He suffered nine broken ribs, a fractured pelvis and a fractured clavicle," 
Demetriades said Monday. "He also has a slightly collapsed lung and there is 
some blood in his chest cavity. He will undergo conservative treatment and I do 
not anticipate having to perform surgery. I expect he'll be able to get out of 
bed within the next two days and out of the hospital in the next 10 to 14 days. 
</P>
<P>
 "If everything goes as planned, he should be able to resume light duties at 
work in three weeks." 
</P>
<P>
 Basketball practice is scheduled to start Oct. 15. Assistant coaches Charlie 
Parker and Jack Fertig are out of town recruiting, but Adrian Walters, a 
second-year assistant, doesn't foresee a problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "I spoke with (Raveling) this morning and he's obviously in some pain," said 
Walters, the only coach in the basketball office Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I know from working with him, I know that he'll bounce back. Knowing Rav, 
he'll be there for the first practice. If he's not there, he'll be coaching 
from his bedside." 
</P>
<P>
 Raveling, 57, was injured when his Jeep Cherokee collided with a BMW driven by 
Robert Ziehm at the intersection of 39th Street and Arlington Avenue on Sunday 
morning. Ziehm is a former professor at the USC School of Dentistry. 
</P>
<P>
 No charges have been filed in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel like I'm the luckiest guy in the world to have survived this 
accident," said Raveling, who was treated at the emergency room at County-USC 
Medical Center before being moved to USC University Hospital. "I anticipate a 
speedy recovery." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Mike Garrett, USC athletic director: "The entire Trojan family extends 
our prayers and best wishes to Coach Raveling for a quick and complete 
recovery. We look forward to having him back on the basketball court soon. 
</P>
<P>
 "While he recovers, the USC men's basketball program is in the hands of a very 
capable group of assistant coaches. With preseason practice beginning in 
several weeks, I know that Coach Raveling and his assistants will work together 
closely to prepare our team for a successful season." 
</P>
<P>
 Raveling, who was offered a $2-million contract by Seton Hall but turned it 
down to remain at USC in July, is beginning his ninth season with the Trojans. 
He has led USC to four consecutive postseason tournament berths and has a 
336-292 record in his 22-year college coaching career. 
</P>
<P>
 "Coach Rav had a saying that he always told me, 'An injury is a long way from 
the heart,' " said Mark Boyd, a co-captain on last season's team. 
</P>
<P>
 "His heart is the strongest part of his character, so he'll be OK. The program 
doesn't have to worry. Things will be in order."

NOON WINS $1-MILLION JURY AWARD; JURISPRUDENCE: VERDICT IN FAVOR OF FORMER NCAA 
SHOTPUT CHAMPION IS INTENDED TO SEND USA TRACK & FIELD A MESSAGE ABOUT DRUG 
TESTING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLIOTT ALMOND, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sending a strong message to USA Track & Field, a San Diego Superior Court jury 
Monday awarded Brent Noon, three-time NCAA shotput champion from the University 
of Georgia, almost $1 million in a suit over a 1992 drug test. 
</P>
<P>
 Noon, 22, claimed that the national governing body for the sport illegally 
banned him from competition in 1992 when he failed to take the test, violated 
its own rules and then tried to conceal mistakes by back-dating documents. 
</P>
<P>
 Noon said he'd suffered mental distress because the suspension, handed down 
five weeks before the U.S. Olympic track and field trials, adversely affected 
his ability to make the 1992 Olympic team. 
</P>
<P>
 "Brent did this to stop this kind of conduct (by track officials), to make 
sure it didn't happen to any other athletes," said Terry Singleton, an 
Escondido attorney representing Noon, who could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Pete Cava, USA Track spokesman, said the organization will file an appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course it's disappointing," he said from Indianapolis. "But we don't want 
to say much." 
</P>
<P>
 Monday's verdict concludes a two-year battle for Noon, who also had sued Art 
Venegas, UCLA's assistant track coach, for defamation. 
</P>
<P>
 Noon claimed that Venegas had spread rumors that the shotputter from Fallbrook 
used anabolic steroids to become California's all-time best. UCLA and Venegas 
settled with Noon in July. Terms of the settlement were sealed by Superior 
Court Judge Richard Haden. 
</P>
<P>
 John Campbell, USA Track's attorney, said the award was about as much as Noon 
asked in settlement proceedings. Although Noon was awarded $983,000, Campbell 
said it will be reduced to $740,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, he said USA Track did nothing wrong beyond making a human error. 
</P>
<P>
 "The result does not fit the evidence," Campbell said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jurors said they wanted to send a message to track officials to ensure 
athletes are handled fairly when undergoing drug testing. 
</P>
<P>
 "They ruined his reputation, ruined his name and they were going to pay for 
it," Singleton said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I understood (the decision) has tremendous ramifications for other athletes 
who come through the system," said Eletta Files, a juror from Lakeside, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
 Noon claimed he was banned in April of 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The notice was sent to Fallbrook, but the Noons had moved to Athens, where 
Noon was enrolled at Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
 Then a drug-test kit was sent to Georgia's athletic department with 
instructions to return it within 48 hours. Noon said he learned of the request 
a day after the deadline. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he claimed not to have known about the test and offered to take it 
afterward, Noon was banned. His eligibility was restored after five weeks, but 
Noon said the ordeal affected his training. He finished ninth at the Olympic 
trials.

DRIVER REMAINS IN DANGER; MOTOR RACING: ACCIDENT IN OHIO RACE LEAVES PARNELLI 
JONES' 22-YEAR-OLD SON, PAGE, UNCONSCIOUS AND IN INTENSIVE CARE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Second-generation race driver Page Jones remained unconscious Monday night in 
the intensive care unit of a Dayton, Ohio, hospital after suffering a skull 
fracture during a race Sunday in Rossburg, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones, 22, son of 1963 Indianapolis 500 winner Parnelli Jones, was leading the 
sprint car portion of the U.S. Auto Club's 4-Crown Nationals at Eldora Speedway 
when his car apparently went up on two wheels along a concrete wall and began 
cartwheeling. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses said that when the car stopped rolling, it was on its side, with 
Jones' head exposed to oncoming traffic. A trailing car, driven by Dave 
Darland, crashed into Jones' car. Jones' helmet was split from the impact. 
</P>
<P>
 The accident occurred on lap 13 of a 30-lap race that Jones had led from the 
start. 
</P>
<P>
 He was airlifted to Miami Valley Hospital in Dayton, where a relative said 
Monday that his vital signs appeared good, although he remained on a respirator 
and in a coma. Jones also has a broken shoulder and collarbone and back 
injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 His parents, Parnelli and Judy Jones, and his brother, P.J., also a race 
driver, flew to his bedside Sunday night. P.J., who has been testing Dan 
Gurney's new Toyota Indy car this year, had driven in a truck race Saturday 
night in Tucson, Ariz., and was flying his plane home when a family friend 
called from Eldora with the news of Page's accident. Parnelli was in Utah 
vacationing, and Judy was driving to Ojai. 
</P>
<P>
 P.J. contacted his parents. Judy turned around and headed for LAX, where she 
caught a plane to Phoenix to meet him and they flew to Utah in Vince 
Granatelli's private jet, picked up Parnelli and went on to Dayton. 
</P>
<P>
 Page, whose home is in Rolling Hills, has been driving in the USAC midget, 
sprint car and Silver Crown series this year in the Midwest while living in 
Indianapolis with Mike Bliss, 1993 Silver Crown champion. He stands fifth in 
national midget standings. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones had been testing Busch Grand National cars in hopes of joining the 
NASCAR series and had been racing midgets and sprint cars while biding his 
time. This year, he has won five midget and two sprint car main events. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, driving mostly on the USAC midget circuit, he won 16 main events, 
including the Belleville Nationals, the biggest race of the year. In last 
year's 4-Crown Nationals at Eldora, he drove in the midget race and finished 
second. He scored four of his 16 victories at Ventura, where he began his 
career at 11 driving go-karts. 
</P>
<P>
 Page first attracted attention as a potential driver when he was 14 and won 
the Ventura County dirt track go-kart championship. The next year he won the 
Western States title. In the fall of 1989, Page was the youngest of six 
Americans selected to race in the Soviet Union, where he won one of two kart 
races won by the Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 He moved up to USAC midgets in 1990 and in 1991 had one streak during which he 
won six consecutive races in the western regional series. At Cajon Speedway in 
El Cajon, he became the first USAC driver to win a three-quarter midget and 
full midget main event on the same program. Later that season, he repeated the 
feat at Ventura Raceway. 
</P>
<P>
 He also drove in the Barber Saab series for open-wheel, open-cockpit cars in 
hopes of getting an Indy car ride. He had three second-place finishes and 
placed fourth in the standings. After finishing the series, Jones drove an Indy 
Lights car in the season finale at Laguna Seca where he ran as high as fourth 
before brake failure forced him to slow down. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones returned to Barber Saab in 1992 and won three races, finishing third in 
the series. 
</P>

CHRIS FOSTER: THEY'RE PLAYING BY THE RULES

<TEXT>
<P>
 Hi, I'm Ike Harmon. Just call me Eye-Key, which rhymes with a certain brand of 
shoes I hope to be hawking some day on TV. 
</P>
<P>
 To get that, I have to become famous. To get that, I have to have a basketball 
scholarship. To get that, I have to go to the right high school. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana Valley. Yeah, that's the place. It's been loads of laughs here at 
Century, but see ya. 
</P>
<P>
 OK, so Ike Harmon is the villain here. The guy deserted his school, leaving 
Century for Santa Ana Valley. He basically told his teammates, "You're not good 
enough." He's the one to blame. Boo. Hiss. 
</P>
<P>
 Wait. How can Harmon be the villain? He lives near Santa Ana Valley. His 
sisters attended that school. Sure, he spent two years at Century with his 
brother Thomas, but his transfer was legal under district and Southern Section 
rules. 
</P>
<P>
 So, he gets to play with Olujimi Mann, one of the nation's top juniors. 
</P>
<P>
 Aha! We found him. Mann, yeah, he's the villain. Olujimi, that 6-foot-4 
all-world point guard. He played with Harmon on a traveling team this spring. 
Olujimi wouldn't have had to say a word, just make a crisp pass to Harmon for a 
dunk. The message would be clear. Come with me, come with me. He's the one to 
punish. 
</P>
<P>
 Wait. How can Mann be the villain? All he did was play some hoops with another 
exceptional player. They were just a couple of kids having some fun. And it was 
all legal under district and Southern Section rules. 
</P>
<P>
 So, Falcon Coach Rich Prospero gets Harmon, a 6-5 junior, to wear a Santa Ana 
Valley jersey. 
</P>
<P>
 There he is! Rich Prospero, he's the villain. Was there ever any doubt? Just 
look at him. Shifty-eyes, bald head. Is he related to Jerry Tarkanian or what? 
The guy has a roster full of transfers. You know "bandit-program" is such an 
ugly phrase, but let's use it. Why, he even played Harmon in three summer 
league games before the kid had even transferred. If the rotund one at that 
certain parochial school had done such a thing, it would have been 
pitchforks-and-torches time up on Bristol and Edinger. Let's get Prospero. 
</P>
<P>
 Wait. It can't be Prospero. Sure, he gaffed one by playing Harmon this summer. 
But an investigation showed no other wrong-doing. He got a slap on the wrist 
and, hopefully, a lesson learned. As to the plethora of out-of-towners on his 
roster, they are all legal under district and Southern Section rules. 
</P>
<P>
 So, he gets Harmon, a player college recruiters will covet in a couple 
seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 That's it! Harmon's parents, they're the villains. Who else could it be? They 
don't want to pay for a college education. You know those overzealous moms and 
dads. They shop their kids around and try to weasel deals. Anything, just to 
get their kids into the right program. Let's call a social worker and find a 
foster home for the kid. 
</P>
<P>
 Wait. How can Harmon's parents be villains? They just want their son to be 
happy and go to a school he enjoys. And, yes, have some fun on the basketball 
court. He is, after all, their child. And it's all perfectly legal under 
district and Southern Section rules. 
</P>
<P>
 So people are going to see one fine Santa Ana Valley basketball team this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 There we go! Society is the villain. Isn't it always in these matters? We put 
too much emphasis on sports. We worship athletes like gods. We want our kids to 
be like Mike (in basketball, not baseball). And, always, we have an eye on the 
almighty dollar. 
</P>
<P>
 Wait. Society? 
</P>
<P>
 I have a headache. 
</P>
<P>
 There it is. Can't find a villain. Only a victim. 
</P>
<P>
 Century Coach Greg Coombs, who counted on Harmon to anchor his team. 
</P>
<P>
 Sorry Greg.

OFFICIALS GIVE THEIR VIEWS ON TRANSFERS; IT SEEMS TO WORK IN DISTRICTS WHERE 
RULE IS IN PLACE, BUT SOME COACHES ARE SKEPTICAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Open enrollment, which some coaches fear could turn into a license to steal 
for those in need of standout athletes, is nothing new. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana Unified School District has had such a policy for more than 25 
years. Irvine's has been in place since 1972, and Fullerton instituted its 
policy in the spring of '93. 
</P>
<P>
 Ken Stichter, an assistant superintendent with the Fullerton Joint Union High 
School District, is a fan of open enrollment. He said there were no glaring 
problems with the policy in its first year, adding that the district received 
114 transfer requests "and granted them all." 
</P>
<P>
 "Most were ninth graders coming in," Stichter said. "Most other kids are not 
interested in changing once they get into a system." 
</P>
<P>
 Students cannot change schools solely to participate in athletics. At least 
that's what the rules say. Not only does the California Interscholastic 
Federation prohibit this -- having the power to suspend an athletic program in 
violation -- but the districts do as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the understandings is parents and coaches cannot influence a student 
to go to a school for sports," said Jerry Rayl, an assistant superintendent 
with the Irvine Unified School District. "That kind of tampering puts 
everything in jeopardy." 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Tafoya, an assistant superintendent in Santa Ana, says: "A successful 
program is the best 'recruitment.' But a coach cannot contact a kid from 
another school. The student must be referred to the home school first. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a lot of reasons a kid can put down for a transfer. Some schools 
may offer a particular program -- computers, ROTC -- the student cannot get at 
the home school." 
</P>
<P>
 But some coaches remain skeptical of student movement. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton football Coach Julian Smilowitz says there are parents actively 
"shopping" their kids to schools, which has "created some havoc." 
</P>
<P>
 Although he says no one has approached him or his program, Smilowitz said, 
"It's happening in our league and others. I don't think anyone discourages it. 
(Open enrollment) is one of those rulings that has opened a door. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't contact parents or players, but they can go to any coach they want. 
It's not like college recruiting; nobody's promising them cars or things like 
that. Yet the big pieces of pies go to the guys who have established programs." 
</P>
<P>
 Ed Matillo, Buena Park boys' basketball coach, is concerned that Orange County 
school districts will be hampered by the kinds of problems identified with 
other places. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've heard in L.A. (open enrollment) is a joke," Matillo said. "Coaches there 
and in Long Beach say kids are moving left and right. They're changing so fast 
no one can keep track of where they are." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Los Angeles Locke High's football team recently was placed on one 
year's probation by the CIF City Section after its coaches admitted talking to 
students outside Locke's attendance boundary. 
</P>
<P>
 Dean Crowley, Southern Section commissioner, agrees there has been 
considerable student movement in Long Beach but says most of it has been within 
districts instead of between districts. 
</P>
<P>
 "Long Beach has always had rules to let kids move (to enhance) ethnic balance, 
but it's been district to district," Crowley said. "One student left Long Beach 
Poly to play basketball at Dominguez High, not realizing that Dominguez was in 
the Compton (Unified School) District, which didn't have open enrollment. And 
he wasn't eligible." 
</P>
<P>
 But Crowley says no system is perfect. Even without open enrollment or relaxed 
transfer rules, determined parents find ways to get around the regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 "Disgruntled parents have manipulated rules for years," he said. "You can say 
you have one address, give it up, move elsewhere and be eligible. If it's a 
family of means, you can use the rules to your benefit. Those things happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Not all coaches foresee a rabid pursuit of top athletes. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine football Coach Terry Henigan, whose teams have won three consecutive 
Southern Section titles, said there has never been a problem among his school, 
Woodbridge and University. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've lost a few to Woodbridge because we have one feeder junior high school 
we share, and kids like to go where their friends do," Henigan said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Where it's factor, to be honest, is in other sports -- youth baseball, 
basketball -- where kids from different schools play together outside of the 
school season. Plus, there are some high school coaches who work in those 
activities." 
</P>
<P>
 Henigan admits to having qualms about coaches having that kind of contact 
outside of school. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm uncomfortable with that because I live in Irvine," he said. "When my 
youngsters were involved in those activities, I felt I had to stay away because 
it puts you in an awkward position. I didn't want anybody to construe that I 
was trying recruit kids." 
</P>
<P>
 So what should districts facing open enrollment for the first time do to make 
sure it works the way it's intended? 
</P>
<P>
 Coaches say the Southern Section and the school districts must create strong 
checks and balances to discourage cheating. Tougher penalties need to be 
imposed on those schools caught -- "(Now it's often only) a slap on the hand," 
said Murphy Tammaro, an assistant football coach at Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 As to the future success of open enrollment, only time will tell. For the most 
part, administrators and coaches in the Fullerton, Irvine and Santa Ana 
districts believe it has worked. 
</P>
<P>
 "Success with most changes comes when you communicate with people up front," 
Stichter said. "We went out of our way to make sure that people were informed 
on how things work. And we were surprised at how smooth things went."

 INCORRECT REPORT -- An article Sunday incorrectly reported that palm fronds 
cut from trees on Oak Park Unified School District property were used to build 
a succah on the Conifer Street property of Chabad of the Conejo. Chabad Rabbi 
Moshe Bryski said Chabad purchased the palm fronds used in its succah from a 
dealer in Los Angeles. Bryski said a resident who attends Chabad services cut 
the school district's fronds for private use without congregation authority.

DO NOT OPEN 'TIL, ER, NOVEMBER; CRUSH OF NEW, STARRY FILMS FORCE STUDIOS TO 
LAUNCH CHRISTMAS FARE EARLIER. THE HOPE: BEST YEAR'S TOTAL EVER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 There are a full 89 shopping days left until Christmas but for the motion 
picture industry, the holidays officially kick off in a little more than a 
month. The opening salvos are "Mary Shelley's Frankenstein" from TriStar 
Pictures, starring Robert De Niro, and Universal Pictures' coming-of-age drama 
"The War," pairing Elijah Wood and Kevin Costner. Both films debut Nov. 4. 
</P>
<P>
 Wait a second. Isn't that rushing things a bit? 
</P>
<P>
 Not as far as MCA/Universal motion picture group chairman Tom Pollock is 
concerned. When he went to one of the better department stores last weekend, 
Christmas decorations were already up. If retailers continue to move the season 
up earlier and earlier, he contends, there's no reason why the movie business 
can't do it too. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, points out Disney marketing president Robert Levin, the holiday 
season is a bit of a misnomer. Unlike summer, which witnesses a consistent 
attendance expansion from Memorial Day through Labor Day, the end of the year 
holiday window delivers a business rush only in fits and starts: for about five 
days around Thanksgiving and another week between Christmas and New Year's Day. 
</P>
<P>
 It makes sense then, he says, to get as many playing days for such films as 
his studio's "The Santa Clause," starring Tim Allen, and 20th Century Fox's 
remake of "Miracle on 34th Street." Both will be out prior to Thanksgiving 
because Christmas-themed movies usually peter out after the calendar 
celebration of the holiday. 
</P>
<P>
 However, many of the coming season's significant early releases won't be 
Yuletide titles. "Frankenstein" will make haste to get established with 
audiences a week before the arrival of another florid monster movie, the much 
ballyhooed "Interview With the Vampire" starring Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt. The 
Samuel Goldwyn Company will open David Mamet's sexual harassment drama 
"Oleanna" nationally on Nov. 11 to get some attention before another similarly 
themed film, "Disclosure," starring Michael Douglas and Demi Moore, arrives in 
December. 
</P>
<P>
 The largely animated "The Pagemaster" debuts Nov. 11, a week before New Line's 
animated "The Swan Princess." ("Pagemaster" features super-tyke Macaulay Culkin 
who also stars in Warner Bros.' December release "Richie Rich.") 
</P>
<P>
 Other early-in-the-season "big gun" titles include Paramount's "Star Trek: 
Generations," Disney's re-release of "The Lion King" and Universal's Arnold 
Schwarzenegger-Danny DeVito comedy "Junior." 
</P>
<P>
 "There is so much new movie product this season that the so-called Christmas 
season has grown to accommodate the crush of new films," says Howard Lichtman, 
spokesman for the Toronto-based Cineplex Odeon theater chain. 
</P>
<P>
 If the front-loading strategy of releasing so many films so early works, says 
Tom Boris of box-office tracking firm Entertainment Data Inc., those films 
could raise the overall attendance level through to the end of the year. If it 
doesn't, there will be the inevitable back-to-the-drawing-board re-evaluation. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, exhibitors are buoyed by this steady flow of releases -- about 35 films 
in all -- observing that as many as a dozen have the potential to gross from 
$50 million to more than $100 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The line-up of commercially viable product for the holidays is as strong as 
it's ever been, according to Fox's distribution chief Tom Sherak, whereas last 
year was largely dominated by the family films "Mrs. Doubtfire" and "Aladdin." 
</P>
<P>
 A strong holiday season could ensure the shattering of 1993's box-office 
record tally of $5.2 billion. Through the end of this past summer, business was 
almost 5% ahead of last year. And it's shaping up to be a better than average 
fall, say exhibitors and distributors. 
</P>
<P>
 With more playing days for the "big gun" holiday titles, industry executives 
are hoping this year's increase in ticket sales will continue unabated, making 
1994 the best performer ever. Of course, as with every year "you better have 
the goods, or you should get out of the kitchen," cautions Sherak about the 
upcoming holiday slate. And there will undoubtedly be some last-minute 
defections. New Line Pictures, however, has made a last-minute addition to the 
season with the Jim Carrey comedy "Dumb and Dumber." 
</P>
<P>
 Originally scheduled for release in 1995, the company took the plunge at the 
behest of exhibitors. "The trailer was playing gangbusters," says Chris Pula, 
head of marketing at New Line, which also released Carrey's $100-million-plus 
comedy hit "The Mask." The company's distribution chief, Al Shapiro, began 
receiving phone calls from theater chains asking him to move up the date since 
there was no broad-based comedy appealing to the young male demographic at 
Christmas. "Dumb and Dumber" debuts Dec. 16; Jean-Claude Van Damme's action 
film "Streetfighter" is its main competition. 
</P>
<P>
 For more sophisticated laughs there's Nora Ephron's "Lifesavers," starring 
Steve Martin, and two romantic comedies: Paramount's "I.Q.," teaming Meg Ryan 
and Tim Robbins, and MGM/UA's "Speechless," starring Michael Keaton and Geena 
Davis. The latter could benefit from comparisons to the real-life political 
romance between James Carville and Mary Matalin. 
</P>
<P>
 More adult-oriented fare usually waits until Christmas Day to open, when its 
constituency becomes available. But, observes MGM/UA marketing head Gerry Rich, 
this year Christmas falls on a Sunday, robbing the industry of one holiday 
weekend (Christmas Eve and most of Christmas Day are normally box-office low 
points for moviegoing). That makes it all the more crucial to establish a film 
before the Christmas weekend. Hence, the stacking of releases on Dec. 16 and 
23. 
</P>
<P>
 What seems to be missing this Christmas is the usual line-up of Oscar-worthy 
prestige movies. With the exception of Fox's drama "Nell," starring Jodie 
Foster, and Warners' baseball biography "Cobb," starring Tommy Lee Jones, there 
don't seem to be any major studio releases on the order of last year's 
"Schindler's List," "Philadelphia," "Remains of the Day" and "In the Name of 
the Father." 
</P>
<P>
 It's just the luck of the draw, say industry nabobs. Such directors as Steven 
Spielberg, Martin Scorsese, Jonathan Demme and Jim Sheridan, who can be counted 
on to deliver potential Oscar offerings, didn't make a film this year. Others 
like Barry Levinson and Neil Jordan ("The Crying Game") have tackled more 
overtly commercial projects, "Disclosure" and "Vampire," respectively. 
</P>
<P>
 There will be several independently-made Oscar hopefuls, including Roman 
Polanski's drama "Death and the Maiden," starring Ben Kingsley and Sigourney 
Weaver, Robert Altman's fashion satire "Pret-a-Porter," with an all-star 
ensemble cast, the inter-generational saga "The Perez Family," with Anjelica 
Huston and Marisa Tomei, and "Mrs. Parker" with Jennifer Jason-Leigh in the 
title role as writer Dorothy Parker. 
</P>
<P>
 Barring last-minute surprises, many of the stronger best picture hopefuls may 
already have been released, suggest insiders -- Disney's "Quiz Show" and "The 
Lion King," Paramount's "Forrest Gump" and Gramercy's "Four Weddings and a 
Funeral."
