TURF WARS: BLOODLESS BUT MOST VICIOUS; U.S. MILITARY LEADERS WILL TRY AGAIN TO 
FOSTER COOPERATION AMONG SERVICES. GOOD LUCK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The turf wars of the armed services of the United States are the stuff of lore 
and legend. Probably no battle against foreign foe has been fought with greater 
commitment, if less bloodshed, than the battles the services have waged against 
each other and their reform-minded civilian bosses over the last half-century, 
in defense of their roles and missions and to preserve or expand their separate 
budgets. 
</P>
<P>
 Aided in many cases by vigorous lobbying groups and powerful allies in 
Congress, the services have repeatedly frustrated efforts to change their 
traditional ways of doing things. Robert S. McNamara, when he was defense 
secretary in the 1960s, labored hard to get the Air Force and Navy to agree on 
a single plane that could be launched both from carriers and land bases, and so 
save billions in development and procurement costs. Not only did he fail in 
that attempt, but in the end he even had to confess that he couldn't get the 
Army and Marines to agree to buy the same T-shirts and belt buckles. 
</P>
<P>
 The topmost military leadership, with the backing of Gen. John M. 
Shalikashvili, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, is getting ready to 
try again to achieve greater cooperation among the services and bring greater 
coherence to the nation's defense effort. Among the measures proposed in a 
project headed by Adm. William A. Owens, vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs, are 
cooperative budget planning in place of each service's preparation of its own 
spending proposals; elimination of duplication in procurement programs; 
adoption of common systems in, for example, communications and fire-control; 
and possible reallocation of certain missions and roles. 
</P>
<P>
 This is only part of a large and ambitious agenda. The overall goal is to 
reassess military needs in the post-Cold War age and determine what kind of 
forces and what kind of equipment will be most needed. Even in the best of 
circumstances, this is an enormously complex and daunting task. When the 
services can be expected to mass all of their political firepower to prevent 
serious change, and then go to guerrilla warfare after that, the difficulty of 
the effort expands exponentially. 
</P>
<P>
 It's an old problem and it has defied solutions for decades. Service loyalty 
is all but sacred to most military professionals, jealousy over traditional 
roles is intense and precious few uniformed professionals who hope to rise 
higher are prepared to endorse any significant changes in how their own 
services do things. Yet change is unavoidable if the United States is to adapt 
successfully to the military requirements of the post-Soviet age. If, against 
all experience, the services can somehow be made to agree with that, a big part 
of the reform battle will have been won.

DIGNITY SHAPED IN THE GLARE OF TRAGEDY; AN UNWILLING PUBLIC ICON, JACQUELINE 
KENNEDY ONASSIS HEWED ALWAYS TO HER OWN PATH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis is dead, and the grief that Americans feel is not 
just a grief for her and her family. What she stood for is something Americans 
obscurely yearn for. The word for it -- more than taste or even grace -- is 
dignity. 
</P>
<P>
 No American old enough to remember the day will ever forget her ravaged 
nobility at the funeral of her husband, the slain President John F. Kennedy. 
Virtually the entire nation saw her whisper to her 3-year-old son that the 
moment had come for him to salute. But that was not the only part of the 
ceremony touched by her sense of bravery and decorum. The assassination in 
Dallas had been a scene not just of horror but also of squalor. In Washington, 
mere days later, she helped shape a public liturgy that turned a hideous trauma 
into a healing catharsis.  
</P>
<P>
 But a woman's dignity is defined by more than a husband's death. "I am the man 
who accompanied Jacqueline Kennedy to Paris," Jack Kennedy quipped after a 
triumphant state visit. 
</P>
<P>
 She was a mother as well as a wife, the mother of two children, Caroline and 
John Jr. Her infant son Patrick, born in 1963, lived just two days. Can any 
moment in a woman's life cry out for privacy more loudly than that one? It was 
then, perhaps, that she began learning how to secure the minimum of privacy 
that dignity requires. 
</P>
<P>
 When her remarriage, to Greek shipping magnate Aristotle Onassis, was 
announced, many Americans were in shock. Was she marrying for money? To a point 
she was, but financing her famous wardrobe played a smaller role in her 
decision than financing elaborate security arrangements that she herself could 
not afford. Eventually the world agreed to call her Jacqueline Onassis. 
</P>
<P>
 Widowed again, she made a private life but not a life that made a fetish of 
privacy. True, in the 30 years since JFK's assassination she never gave an 
interview, but she appeared often in public. She sometimes fled her celebrity, 
but she refused to be ruled by it. As an editor at Doubleday, she pursued her 
own eclectic tastes in the authors she chose, Nobel prize-winning Egyptian 
novelist Naguib Mahfouz and dancer and choreographer Twyla Tharp among them. 
These were not interests developed to make a husband look good or tend a public 
image. They were hers. 
</P>
<P>
 She never sought to be a role model or a public servant. She was, in her way, 
like a conscript who becomes a war hero and public icon. Her achievement, past 
a certain point, is a quiet defense of the human being who was there before 
history staged its kidnaping and the legend began. In a simple but compelling 
way, she knew who she was. At a time when her country is insecure in its 
identity and uncertain in its taste, her passing leaves a sorrow touched with 
wonder.

LAWSUITS ARE CUDGELS, PRESIDENTS NEED ARMOR; DELAY CIVIL ACTIONS JUST UNTIL 
THEY LEAVE OFFICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sometime soon a federal judge in Little Rock will consider a motion whose 
central idea is that the President of the United States should be immune from 
all civil lawsuits, specifically from suits growing out of actions that 
occurred before the President took office. There's no precedent for seeking 
such immunity and there is no law that could clearly guide a ruling. But what's 
at issue is not so much a point of law as the need to safeguard the orderly 
functioning of the presidency. 
</P>
<P>
 If the courts hold that a President -- any President -- can be sued for 
alleged civil wrongs that predated his inauguration, then predictably there 
would be no end to the number of suits such a ruling could invite. The 
presidency would become a lawsuit-plagued institution, its occupant bedeviled 
by endless and in most cases frivolous demands on his time, his personal 
financial resources, his energies. Presidencies could become effectively 
paralyzed and the nation could be left essentially leaderless. 
</P>
<P>
 We believe the President should be given immunity from civil suits while in 
office, with the immunity ending as soon as he leaves office. To protect 
plaintiffs' rights, the statute of limitations in some cases might have to be 
extended; a temporary grant of immunity to a President must not become a 
permanent grant for an ex-President. Election to high office does not and 
should not constitute a pardon for any wrongdoing that might have earlier been 
committed. And no person who may have been harmed by someone later elected 
President should lose the right to seek justice. 
</P>
<P>
 The question of presidential immunity of course grows out of the $700,000 suit 
filed by Paula Corbin Jones, who alleges that Bill Clinton, while still 
governor of Arkansas, made a sexual proposal that caused her emotional distress 
and violated her civil rights. Jones waited three years before filing her 
complaint and her cause has been taken up by a number of Clinton's longtime 
political enemies in Arkansas as well as by various nationally active 
right-wing groups and individuals. We note this not to take sides in Jones vs. 
Clinton , but only to bring forward the possibility we raised earlier, that 
partisanship alone could possibly inspire or encourage many civil suits against 
the President. 
</P>
<P>
 The Supreme Court properly held a dozen years ago that Presidents can't be 
sued for official acts carried out while they are in office. There are 
compelling institutional reasons for extending that immunity to civil suits 
arising out of pre-presidential actions, though of course not to cases 
involving criminal wrongdoing. The alternative is to face the threat that 
Presidents would be left exposed to unremitting legal harassment. The 
disruption to government could be enormous, and the consequences for the nation 
and its leadership in world affairs would be profound. 
</P>
<P>
 Paula Jones is entitled to her day in court. She chose to wait a full three 
years after the alleged event before seeking that day. We think the 
responsibilities of the presidency require that she now wait until Clinton is 
out of office to pursue her case. Without prejudice to her or any other 
plaintiff's rights, the courts and Congress should do what is necessary to 
insulate the presidency from civil lawsuits.

GRAND JURY'S WATCHDOG ROLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * As a member of the Los Angeles County Grand Jury, 1990-1991, I commend Bill 
Boyarsky for his column, "The Watchdog With Scant Time to Watch" (May 11). The 
1990-1991 grand jury was the last to perform watchdog functions. Freed from 
hearing criminal cases, the 1990-1991 grand jury was able to address its other 
mandated functions: inspecting the 165 jails in the county; investigating and 
responding to citizen complaints, beginning investigations, and appointing its 
auditors, and making its final report to the Board of Supervisors. During the 
year, we spent only 54 days in hearing cases brought by the district attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 When our term ended, six of us wrote to Presiding Judge Rick Torres, asking 
that a second jury be impaneled to hear criminal cases. We said, "The mere 
presence of the grand jury as well as its inquiries has been of inestimable 
help in improving government and making it more responsible to the citizenry. 
It is an important part of the system of checks and balances that make our form 
of government unique." 
</P>
<P>
 There is another aspect of the grand jury role that Boyarsky did not touch, 
and that is the jury makeup. The current grand jury does not reflect the 
demographic profile of the county. The 1990-1991 panel had no African or Asian 
Americans, and three had Spanish last names. Although to qualify for 
appointments, one needs to be at least 18 years of age, the grand jury is not 
surfeited with young people. Most members are retired, elderly and have 
independent incomes. With jurors receiving $25 per day, poor and middle-income 
people need not apply. We recommended to Judge Torres that this apparent 
economic discrimination be addressed through increasing the daily stipend or 
creating a special fund, thus allowing a broader sector of our community to 
serve without economic hardship. 
</P>
<P>
 As Boyarsky noted, it's time for a change!

<P>
 * Boyarsky's column talks about ways to improve the grand jury system.  
</P>
<P>
 Both grand jurors who spoke up were members of the Continuity Committee of the 
1992-1993 grand jury, which recommended an automated computer tracking system 
to monitor compliance with previous grand jury recommendations. That grand jury 
did buy a computer from the printing budget, reduced the cost of publishing 
final reports and began uploading previous grand jury files into the system. 
</P>
<P>
 There are two other resources to provide continuity and track responses to 
grand jury recommendations. The Grand Jurors Assn. of Los Angeles County was 
formed in 1955 to provide continuity, and March 1, 1977, the association was 
given authority from the Board of Supervisors to provide them directly with 
reports as to adequate implementation of those approved for implementation or 
study at no cost to the county. In 1993-94, the GJA has followed up reports on 
expansion of the Pasadena jail lockup, which was approved in 1992, study of the 
Children's Court procedures listed in two recent reports and a report on 
community-based policing and gangs.  
</P>
<P>
 The California Grand Jurors Assn. makes statewide surveys about grand jury 
activities and is currently implementing a Grand Jury Report Indexing program 
which will help track findings and recommendations. CGJA also helps counties 
share information.  
</P>
<P>
 CGJA's annual meeting on May 1 endorsed SB 2000, which establishes a minimum 
uniform standard for governing body/official compliance and requirement to 
comment on findings and recommendations of final grand jury reports. They would 
have to say yes, it has been implemented; it will be implemented with 
timetable; recommended for further analysis, or it will not be implemented, 
with reasons and explanation. 
</P>
<P>
 A study made by the 1991-92 Los Angeles County grand jurors estimated that 
their work on criminal indictments saved the county about $1,273,000 over the 
cost of preliminary hearings. They also made recommendations on elder-care 
services for older people, Exit L.A. to keep businesses from moving out, gangs, 
juvenile services, pensions, Save Our Water, sludge disposal and the fiscal 
impact of illegal immigrants.

ABSENTEEISM IN LAUSD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Of the 33,378 teachers represented in "Teachers' Absenteeism Troubles L.A. 
District" (May 9), 20,839, or 62.4%, missed seven to nine days, or less. That's 
less than one day per month. And 5,364 missed no days. Zero! 
</P>
<P>
 I've been a public schoolteacher since 1969 (in LAUSD since 1973). This year, 
I've been absent three days. I love my work, but I've seen everything in the 
classroom change. Students and teachers are now subjected to the most 
extraordinary distractions imaginable. An occasional "mental health" day can 
serve everyone. 
</P>
<P>
 Teachers must no longer be the fall guys for all that ails society. If 
taxpayers would pay us a decent salary so we could afford to live in this city, 
maybe "mental health" days would not be as prevalent as they seem. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 * Our society will never shape up until we stop passing the buck. A simple 
concept, really, but one that is seldom learned and never used in the L.A. 
Unified School District. Principal Althea Woods chooses to blame teachers' 
absenteeism for the school's "abominable" test scores. 
</P>
<P>
 Do these children come from stable homes? Are their parents using drugs? Are 
the fathers around? Are they gang members? Are they being abused? Does someone 
hug them every day? Are they using drugs? These are the reasons test scores are 
so low and why the school system is in such a catastrophic state. Stop blaming 
a $30,000-salaried teacher for the ills of schoolchildren. 
</P>
<P>
 WENDY TABER 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 * Teachers are now being hung out to dry because they actually use sick days! 
Imagine -- a salaried (not a very high salary) adult taking legitimate illness 
leave during the work year . . . my, my. Your reporter hammered on the 
statistics, but failed to go further to the root cause of this problem. 
</P>
<P>
 The data on the number of substitutes called needs more detail. There are many 
"long-term substitutes" teaching in classes where no certificated teachers have 
been hired or assigned by the district. Substitutes are doing the best they can 
for the students however long they are assigned to a class but they are not 
permanently there. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, there are thousands of students being taught by a succession of 
substitutes rather than full-time teachers because there is a growing shortage 
of teachers in LAUSD. Why? Teachers are laboring daily in classrooms with the 
highest class sizes in the nation. They are teaching for the second year with a 
10% pay cut, providing funds which kept the district financially afloat. They 
are also the most needed but least respected LAUSD employee group. Teachers are 
people; they get sick. Exposure to hundreds of children every day is exposure 
to all the illnesses they carry with them to school. 
</P>
<P>
 Substitutes also received a bad rap in your article. One of the most difficult 
jobs is being a substitute teacher. Imagine going on to an unfamiliar campus, 
meeting with 35 to 40 students either all day or five different sets of classes 
in a day, picking up a lesson plan done by someone else, teaching different 
material and subjects daily, and maintaining discipline in a class that equates 
substitute with a license to misbehave. It's not a pretty picture, but we have 
thousands of teachers willing to brave all that on a daily basis. 
</P>
<P>
 Your article rightfully pointed out that there is little incentive to maintain 
a bank of days. They cannot be applied to retirement credit or be cashed out 
upon retirement. UTLA negotiated a teacher attendance plan in the hope that it 
would provide some money for those who didn't use all their yearly illness days 
and save LAUSD money in the process. Despite attempts to promote this program 
by UTLA, the district has done nothing to either publicize or promote the plan 
districtwide or in the schools. 
</P>
<P>
 HELEN BERNSTEIN 
</P>
<P>
 President, UTLA 
</P>
<P>
 * I suppose I am not the only substitute teacher disturbed by remarks made by 
the full-time teachers, principals and parents who were quoted in the article 
on teacher absenteeism in LAUSD. Substitute teachers were blamed for a variety 
of things, even low sixth-grade test scores. 
</P>
<P>
 I have been employed as a substitute teacher in the Azusa Unified School 
District for 15 years. I have worked with poor substitute teachers, but I have 
also worked with poor full-time teachers and poor principals. No profession is 
exempt from incompetence. 
</P>
<P>
 Substitute teachers are usually called two hours before they are to be at the 
school, often to a classroom they have never seen and to teach 30 or 35 
children they have never met. There are always at least four children who are 
angry because their regular teacher is absent. Believe me, these angry children 
can and will make your life hell. 
</P>
<P>
 I am fortunate to work at Gladstone Street Elementary School where my work is 
valued and appreciated. I feel sorry for the substitute teachers who work at 
the schools mentioned in the article. It must be difficult to work with people 
who have such a low opinion of you.

 A Vocal Protest: Radio jocks Kevin and Bean broadcast their KROQ-FM (106.7) 
morning show live Friday in front of KCAL-TV Channel 9 studios to protest their 
exclusion from a weeklong salute to local deejays on KCAL's "Live in L.A." 
morning show. Rick Dees was the in-studio guest, while outside Kevin Ryder and 
Bean Baxter wore "I Love Rick Dees" shirts as a mock tribute to their morning 
rival on KIIS-FM (102.7). When asked by hosts Steve Edwards and Tawny Little if 
he wanted to make peace with his competitors, Dees said: "I don't want to talk 
to them. There's an incredible amount of meanness in broadcasting and to affirm 
that (is something) I don't want to do." Last October, Dees threatened 
litigation against the KROQ duo on "Live in L.A." when they sent a colleague to 
stake out Dees' home to see if he actually goes to work in the early morning or 
pre-tapes his show.

 Peace Mission: Child star Macaulay Culkin plans to meet with three Long Island 
fifth-graders who were unceremoniously hustled away last Sunday, moments before 
a scheduled interview with him about his new MGM film, "Getting Even With Dad." 
MGM has decided to fly their star back to New York in three weeks just to talk 
to the young reporters from Kidsday, Newsday's kids page. MGM has also invited 
the reporters' fifth-grade class to lunch. On Friday, the three students -- Ike 
Mangat, Jessica Rutkovsky and Thomas Kenny -- wrote to Culkin in an open letter 
in their Kidsday section: "We could give you some advice for the future: Don't 
let older people tell you who to talk to. You are 13, and we think you are old 
enough to make some of your own decisions." LEGAL FILE

 DeLuise Cleared: A grand jury refused to bring charges against Dom DeLuise 
after a male casino employee accused the comic of touching him in a sexual way. 
"That action closes our case," said Atlantic City, N.J., prosecutor Jeffrey 
Blitz. "The grand jury failed to find sufficient reason to proceed with

 * Rick James' Woes Grow: Singer Rick James was ruled ineligible for a state 
drug-treatment program and may have to complete a five-year prison sentence 
instead of being freed later this year. James, 46, had been undergoing 
treatment in Southern California for five months while prison officials decided 
whether he should be formally admitted. This week, the warden ruled James 
ineligible for the short-term program because of assault convictions stemming 
from attacks on two women, said his attorney, Mark Werksman. "(The decision) 
baffles me, because he has done very well in the program," Werksman said. "They 
just looked at the whole package and said, 'We don't like this guy.' "

 * Snapshots Target of Suit: Rock star Rod Stewart and his model-wife, Rachel 
Hunter, have filed a $5-million invasion-of-privacy lawsuit against a local 
celebrity photo distribution company in hopes of keeping bare-all snapshots 
under wraps. Stewart, 49, said the pictures were stolen from the couple's 
Beverly Hills home and wound up in the hands of Splash News and Pictures in 
Santa Monica. "Within the privacy of their home, and for their exclusive 
personal use and enjoyment, the Stewarts posed for and took the photographs," 
according to the lawsuit filed Wednesday. The owners of the photo company, 
Kevin Smith and Gary Morgan, wouldn't say whether they have the pictures. But 
they said they would never distribute stolen material. QUICK TAKES

ART REVIEW; 'E.L. KIRCHNER' BRINGS OUT PAST LESSONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM WILSON, TIMES ART CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The way we see art is not fixed. For decades the persistence of Germanic art 
and artists in Lotusland didn't entirely make sense. Whether it was filmmaker 
Oskar Fischinger, architects Richard Neutra and Rudolf Schindler or collectors 
like Galka Scheyer and Robert Gore Rifkind, the Germanic sensibility was at 
once too rigorous and too passionate for good old fun-loving, laid-back Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Now in still economically discouraged, post-riot, fire and quake L.A., German 
Expressionism appears as a wise, if unsettling Cassandra who has been trying 
all the while to teach us something about the nature of tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles County Museum of Art just opened "The Graphic Art of E.L. 
Kirchner," a selection of prints from the Rifkind Center organized by its 
curator Timothy O. Benson. Five years ago the show would have been just another 
praiseworthy aesthetic exercise for people who like that sort of thing. Today 
it's an apt object lesson in the feel of daily life in a haunted land. 
</P>
<P>
 Ernst Ludwig Kirchner was a leader in founding Die Brucke (The Bridge) in 
1905. The movement, started by a group of young Dresden students, effectively 
launched modern Expressionism. They admired the singular Norwegian Edvard 
Munch, but they reacted against the self-conscious decadence of Art Nouveau. 
They kept its love of craft and graphic design but jettisoned its elegance in 
favor of the bracing, raw primitivism they saw in the art of Dresden's 
ethnographic museum. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike Picasso and Beckmann later they did not try to make life into myth. 
Their sharded style is a kind of modernist naturalism, where the everyday is 
shadowed by the savage. 
</P>
<P>
 Kirchner's color woodcut "Bather's Tossing Reeds" is just a picture of guys 
having fun skinny-dipping, but its blunt manner speaks of wildness untamed 
behind the game. His later "Bathers on Rocks" evokes a baptism. A church tower 
has the quality of something comfortingly familiar suddenly turned aloof and 
threatening. The old beliefs aren't working. A still life of a pitcher and 
flowers tries to gain a moment's peace but curdles saccharine in the attempt. 
</P>
<P>
 Better go visit friends. Too much solitude. Kirchner's "The Theosophist" 
depicts a lean, insistently ordinary German intellectual whose interest echoes 
the spiritual fragmentation of the epoch. His "Portrait of Dr. Ludwig Schames" 
offers a picture of bearded authoritarian dignity with a lascivious nude girl 
in the background. 
</P>
<P>
 There's a good idea. Let's go downtown and leer at the Madchens. There are 
plenty of them. Kirchner sees skinny hookers with pendulous breasts, cabaret 
dancers and acrobats that perform like mechanical marionettes with soft thighs. 
His fancy turns guiltily to thoughts of lust. 
</P>
<P>
 His lovers are sometimes of indeterminate gender. In "Love Scene," it's clear 
that the acid-apple-green body is the woman while the ketchup-colored one is 
the man. Later he murders her and stands aghast at himself. 
</P>
<P>
 To cast ordinary human activities in such anxious terms means something has 
gone badly awry, usually in either the individual or collective psyche. In 
Kirchner's epoch it was both. He saw tough Nietzschian idealism shattered in 
World War I, and then turned into a grotesque monster by the Nazis. He was safe 
in Switzerland when Hitler started his campaign against "degenerate" art, but 
the news was too much for this most sensitive and brilliant of the Bridge 
artists. 
</P>
<P>
 He killed himself in 1938, leaving a memorable record of how it feels when 
everything just goes all wrong.

A 'CLASSICS COLLECTION': WAR STORIES AND MORE; MOVIES: TWENTY-FIVE FILMS MADE 
BY THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT IN 1929-'46 TO BE RELEASED ON VIDEO IN JULY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KRISTINE MCKENNA, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In case you need reminding of just how dramatically the world has changed in 
the last 50 years, look no further than "The Classics Collection," a 
compilation of 25 films made by the British government that is scheduled to be 
released on home video in July. 
</P>
<P>
 Culled from an archive that includes upward of 25,000 films, the initial 
"Classics Collection" -- films made from 1929-1946 -- focuses for the most part 
on World War II and is, among other things, a nostalgic evocation of the last 
romantic war (the atomic weaponry that came at the end of that conflict 
finished off any romance associated with war for good). 
</P>
<P>
 "Welcome to Britain," for instance, was a film made in the 1940s to acclimate 
U.S. soldiers to the ways of England. Featuring appearances by Burgess 
Meredith, Danny Kaye and Bob Hope (who worked for free as part of the war 
effort), the film explains such things as the finer points of how to behave in 
a British pub. Structured as a series of corny vignettes, "Welcome to Britain" 
makes going to war seem like a summer vacation abroad. 
</P>
<P>
 With a release date near the 50th anniversary of D-day, "The Classics 
Collection" is the first of many British historical films that will soon be 
making their way into U.S. video stores. The property of the British Crown 
Archives, which will be the beneficiary of any profits, this vast library of 
unexploited material is also being marketed to the U.S. film industry as an 
untapped resource. (It should be pointed out, however, that the archive, which 
recently opened an office in Los Angeles, consists of finished films only and 
doesn't include stock footage.) 
</P>
<P>
 "These films have been available in the U.K. for quite some time," says Peter 
Steel, head of Footage File, a department of Britain's London-based Office of 
Information, formed in 1947. "With the growing market in home video and the 
anniversary of D-day coming up, this just seemed like an auspicious time to 
make the films available in America. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of the films were made prior to the arrival of television, at a time 
when people often got public service information from short films, usually made 
by the government, that were shown in movie theaters," adds Steel. "So, these 
aren't documentary films -- they're informational films that deal with 
everything from health concerns to how World War II was progressing. Because 
they were made by the government, I suppose some people might call them 
propaganda, but that word is a bit harsh for these films, most of which were 
intended to boost morale." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Although the informational films do tend to be relentlessly upbeat, they 
nonetheless provide a fascinating record of daily life in wartime Britain (a 
time when virtually everyone smoked, on the evidence provided here). Of greater 
interest, perhaps, are the films that intercut actual news footage with 
scripted sequences, including "D-day to Paris," which includes film of the 
final stages of the battle to liberate Paris. 
</P>
<P>
 After release of "The Classics Collection," the BCA hopes to release several 
feature films drawn from 300 included in the library. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have several dramatic films that had theatrical releases at the time they 
were made -- 'Western Approaches,' for instance, which was made in 1944 and is 
one of the first color films," Steel points out. "It was made to commemorate 
the merchant seamen who lost their lives in convoys in the Atlantic and is of 
particular interest because the cast is composed of real seamen. Equally 
noteworthy is 'The True Glory,' a montage of news footage of the war that was 
directed by Carol Reed and Garson Kanin and won the Oscar for best documentary 
feature of 1946. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of our earliest films is 'The Drifters,' which was made in 1929 by John 
Grierson, who's considered the father of documentary filmmaking," he continues. 
"Alfred Hitchcock did two films for us during the war ("Bon Voyage" and 
"Adventure Malgache"), Peter Greenaway did a few in the early '80s (among them 
a profile of fashion designer Zandra Rhodes), and Edward R. Murrow, Laurence 
Olivier and Richard Attenborough all narrated films for us. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "My favorites are the lovely black-and-whites made during the later part of 
the war," he adds. "There's one titled 'Listen to Britain,' for instance, 
that's basically a brief introduction followed music and effects. The point of 
the film was to illustrate that the U.K. was carrying on as normally as it 
could, despite the fact that we were at war. A similar film is 'Worker's 
Weekend,' which shows a crew of workers building an entire aircraft bomber in 
just 24 hours. The film is about enthusiasm and the importance of commitment to 
the war effort. The war films were made to boost morale, and they don't deal 
much with the damage wrought by the war, because people were already well aware 
of that." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the archive's films tend to focus on England's economy and 
industries, British culture does surface occasionally, as in "Instruments of 
the Orchestra," made to educate people about the symphony orchestra, and "Steps 
of the Ballet," which is similarly structured. As to the audience for this 
far-flung collection of films, Steel says "that's impossible to predict at this 
point." 
</P>
<P>
 "With the war films, many of which deal with the finer points of ships and 
aircraft, I would imagine aircraft buffs might be interested. We recently did 
several presentations at the Museum of Flying in Santa Monica, and the audience 
was really fascinated with the films. Fortunately, it's not necessary that the 
films be hugely profitable," he adds, "because, as a government agency, we just 
need to break even in order to keep the series going." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to marketing old films, Britain's Central Office of Information 
continues to make new films -- or, videos, to be exact. "Around 1974 we began 
shooting mostly on video," says Steel, "although occasionally we still use 
35-millimeter film." 
</P>
<P>
 Today, COI's public service films deal with the same subjects that dominate 
American informational films, such things as AIDS awareness, drug prevention 
and prenatal care. 
</P>
<P>
 "The library continues to grow because we've never stopped making films," said 
Steel, "and eventually films from the '60s and '70s will become part of 'The 
Classics Collection.' "

 Corbin Bernsen states: "We were the mirror of that Reagan-Bush, 1980s era of 
greed and lust . . ." regarding "L.A. Law's" run ("Saying So Long to Billable

LIFELESS L.A. RADIO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Perusing the latest Arbitron ratings ("Stern's Back on Top in L.A. Market," 
April 20), I am once again reminded of the sorry state of Los Angeles radio: 
sterile, lifeless and directionless. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles radio has lost its personality, its warmth, its color.While new 
stations such as KCBS-FM ("Arrow 93") offer a fresh approach to music 
programming, it's still just a bunch of songs played in a different order every 
few hours -- a mass-market design by a big-business broadcast consulting firm, 
no doubt. 
</P>
<P>
 What happened to radio? What happened to the verve and vitality that made 
taking your favorite radio station with you everywhere so exciting and 
personal? 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the greatest sin in local radio has been the disappearance of the 
"Doctor Demento Show." The Good Doctor is sorely missed by his 
multi-generational legion of fans here in the show's home base. 
</P>
<P>
 Come on, L.A. radio! If this is the theater of the mind, I'm not sticking 
around for the encore.

 I strongly disagree with "Stuttering John" Melendez's claim that stutterers

TOO MUCH ABOUT QUAKES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 What is it with TV? They continue to show earthquake-related subjects: special 
programs, segments on the news and, in the regular shows, teaser 
advertisements. Aren't they going to allow us to recuperate from the emotional 
effects of the earthquake? 
</P>
<P>
 Families are having a time trying to get their nerves under control and trying 
to keep their kids calmed down, and right in the middle of shows here comes 
this teaser ad saying, in effect, "Are you prepared for the next big one?" And 
then they are always interviewing these scientists who are spending millions of 
dollars of taxpayer money trying to find out when the next one is going to hit. 
And when it comes down to the bottom line, they say, "Any time in the next 50 
years of so. Maybe in the next 100 years."

HOW TO GET SMART ABOUT WATCHING TV 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Slowly but surely media education is reaching schools, and I'm glad Howard 
Rosenberg gave the subject notice in "Urging Kids to Think for Themselves," 
(May 16). 
</P>
<P>
 Educational materials such as those produced by Boston-based Continental 
Cablevision Inc. and Los Angeles' Center for Media Values can help teachers 
broach the subject in classrooms.But parents need help too. In teaching media 
education, it's become clear to me that to raise media-literate children, we 
need media-literate parents. To enhance parents' media literacy, here are some 
exercises: 
</P>
<P>
 * Become aware of your own TV habits. For one week, keep track of all the TV 
you watch. At the end of the week, analyze how much and what you view. Are you 
setting a good example for your children? 
</P>
<P>
 * When you watch TV, practice identifying strategies used in ads to get you 
interested in products. Then teach your kids to identify those techniques: 
jingles, production tricks and emotional appeals. 
</P>
<P>
 * If your kids watch Saturday morning cartoons, try watching. Count how many 
times people hit, threaten or shoot each other. Ask yourself what moral 
messages are being communicated. 
</P>
<P>
 * Keep a log of a night's newscast. What are the top stories? Do you consider 
them the day's most important events? What is left out?

CURBING THE NEGATIVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ideologies are generated and reproduced in the media; in particular, 
ideologies that suggest that certain humans are inferior and others are 
superior. Inferiority is generally represented in race, gender, class and 
sexual preference."South Central," "Def Jam," "Martin," etc., point up a need 
for clarification about the negative effects of TV programs that demean, 
degrade and dehumanize ("Hard to Have Respect for 'South Central,' " Letters, 
April 30). 
</P>
<P>
 Representing humans as one-dimensional stereotypes who confirm racist, sexist 
and homophobic myths oppresses all but a few. It perpetuates distortions that 
help maintain economic, political and social inequities.  
</P>
<P>
 What's needed is a standard for denouncing negative representation. 
Identifying a narrative or character as an "accurate" portrayal that does not 
demean, degrade or dehumanize might be a logical place to begin. Within these 
terms, all television programming is up for scrutiny.

 If Charles Marowitz wants to continue his tired and all too predictable tirade 
against the Mark Taper Forum (doesn't he have anything else to do?), he should 
at least get his facts straight ("Tonys Cheer Taper, What's It Mean?," May 
18).Both "The Kentucky Cycle" and "Angels in America" were significantly 
developed and given major exposure at the Taper. 
</P>
<P>
 The three Tony Award nominations for Taper plays (including Anna Deavere 
Smith's "Twilight: Los Angeles, 1992") are a source of pride and celebration 
for all of Los Angeles. So, Marowitz, give it a rest. Quit your carping!

'MADAME MAO'S MEMORIES' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I'm puzzled by Nancy Churnin's criteria (" 'Madame Mao': Just One View," May 
16). She states that "writing from Madame Mao's point of view leaves out 
crucial questions, such as why she embraced the book and theatrical bannings, 
the executions, the persecutions." 
</P>
<P>
 The answer is obvious: Power . The hurt and abused little girl grew up angry 
and desperate to gain complete power over all those who had abused their power 
over her. It is all there and central to the theme -- how her many humiliating 
experiences led her to become one of the most corrupt and ruthless persons in 
history. It was a fascinating theater experience. 
</P>
<P>
 I can't agree either that "Madame Mao's Memories" should have been more like 
"Evita." Letting Madame Mao tell her own story without any commentator revealed 
her better than anyone else could. 
</P>
<P>
 Theater is not so much education as it is spiritual. It can challenge and 
stretch us. It can enable us to understand others and ourselves better. If we 
gain understanding in our gut from this dramatic experience, we may be able to 
avoid our own abuses of power.

MUSIC REVIEW; NORRINGTON CONCERT: THE PRIMITIVE AND THE PRECIOUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN BERNHEIMER, TIMES MUSIC CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It wasn't your average Thursday night with Beethoven and Berlioz at the Music 
Center. Not even close. 
</P>
<P>
 The gangly guest on the podium, making his belated debut with the Los Angeles 
Philharmonic, was Roger Norrington. He doesn't follow the familiar rules. 
</P>
<P>
 A sometime fugitive from the rarefied world of ancient music, a former tenor, 
a distinguished musicologist and a champion of historical authenticity, he 
brings an independent stylistic perspective even to the so-called standard 
repertory. A quirky iconoclast and controversial individualist, he likes to 
shake up the status quo in dusty old concert halls. 
</P>
<P>
 The objects of his revisionist affection on this occasion were a pair of 
19th-Century masterpieces: Beethoven's bracing Second Symphony and Berlioz's 
wild "Symphonie Fantastique." The Beethoven turned out to be so bracing it 
bordered on raucous. The Berlioz was so wild it teetered on the brink of 
dementia. 
</P>
<P>
 One certainly could worry about performances that constantly vacillated 
between the primitive and the precious. One could pine for the virtues of 
mellowness and gentle understatement. One could question the validity of a 
concept that imposed 19th-Century manners on 20th-Century practices (the two 
B's never dreamed that their music would be played on futuristic instruments in 
a house accommodating 3,000). 
</P>
<P>
 Still, one had to applaud Norrington's daring. His innovations were 
fascinating even when they weren't wholly convincing. 
</P>
<P>
 Norrington wanted to restage Beethoven and Berlioz -- that is, to seat the 
orchestra in configurations comparable to what the composers might have 
expected. That meant placing the first and second violins at opposite sides of 
the conductor, basses at the left rear, and horns on high opposite the 
trumpets. Not incidentally, some Russian orchestras still observe similar 
patterns. 
</P>
<P>
 The results on this occasion imposed drastic separations of choirs. Norrington 
accentuated the obvious by encouraging wide, open, unresonant tone-production, 
especially from the brass. The timbres weren't particularly pretty, but they 
certainly were plangent. 
</P>
<P>
 The British maestro took characteristic liberties in the Beethoven, stretching 
phrases here, pushing tempos there. The rhetoric lumbered one moment, thundered 
the next. While the dynamic scale was always generous, the expressive scale 
varied from elegant to clunky. 
</P>
<P>
 The orchestra followed the visitor's eccentric urgings with obvious good will 
reinforced by considerable virtuosity. It didn't seem to matter that Norrington 
chose to sculpt the slow movements without a baton, that he sometimes 
substituted emotive mime for a clear beat, or that he overconducted some 
passages yet left the delineation of others virtually to chance. 
</P>
<P>
 Norrington played slower and looser with the Berlioz -- which was written only 
28 years after the comparably safe and sane Beethoven. No holds were barred, 
but many bars were held. And held. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 As Pierre Monteux and Charles Munch churned in their Gallic graves, 
Norrington, who conducts from memory, chopped the vast canvas into flashy 
little pieces. He focused the grotesquerie as if this were foreground music in 
a misplaced horror movie. 
</P>
<P>
 In the waltz episode, he placed four incidental harps -- not the two heralded 
in Howard Posner's oddly conventional annotations -- in front of the ensemble, 
as if they were solo instruments. The primary effect: disorientation. 
</P>
<P>
 Essentially, this "Fantastique" was vulgar. It was clumsy. It was imaginative. 
It was fun. And it was, if nothing else, fantastic. 
</P>
<P>
 Next week, the season ends as Norrington has his way with Haydn, via "The 
Seasons." 
</P>
<P>
 * Incidental intelligence: 
</P>
<P>
 Last week we pondered the mystery of the abrupt and possibly premature 
departure of Sidney Weiss, the orchestra's longtime principal concertmaster. 
His place was temporarily taken by Alexander Treger, listed in the official 
roster as just plain concertmaster. 
</P>
<P>
 The Philharmonic also employs an associate concertmaster and an assistant 
concertmaster. On Thursday, however, the first violinist's chair was womanned 
by an unannounced stranger, Bing Wang, who normally serves as principal second 
violinist of the Cincinnati Symphony. 
</P>
<P>
 A company spokesperson explained that Wang was being auditioned to replace the 
associate concertmaster, who is scheduled to take a sabbatical next season. 
Curiouser and curiouser. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 * Norrington repeats this program at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion of the 
Music Center tonight at 8 and Sunday at 2:30 p.m. Tickets $6-$50 at the box 
office , (213) 365-3500.

TV REVIEWS; 'FIELD': POIGNANCY IMMERSED IN HISTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY LOYND

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Before the public's attention and imagination settle on Normandy in two weeks, 
before the hordes descend on the French beaches and villages, "Masterpiece 
Theatre" steps back and dramatizes a touching pilgrimage by a group of 
disparate travelers forever changed by the D-day landings 50 years before. 
</P>
<P>
 "A Foreign Field" is fiction immersed in history, a funny, lovely, poignant 
movie, full of rich characterization and a graveyard visit, a convergence of 
old warriors from Omaha Beach that will leave you limp. 
</P>
<P>
 And what a cast! Sir Alec Guinness, Lauren Bacall, Jeanne Moreau, Leo McKern, 
John Randolph, Geraldine Chaplin and Edward Herrmann cross paths in a sleepy 
resort hotel overlooking the bluffs of the quiet Normandy seashore. Half of 
them D-day veterans, they have come from America and England to remember, to 
tramp the fields and walk the hedgerows where their buddies died -- a sublime 
odyssey that's part pathos, part comedy and part epiphany. 
</P>
<P>
 Bacall, in an unexpectedly muted performance, will stop your breath. Guinness, 
as a beribboned hero rendered childlike by old shrapnel wounds, is almost 
Pan-like, magically playing his harmonica and wandering off to his own tune. 
</P>
<P>
 Written by Roy Clarke and directed by Charles Sturridge for the BBC, "A 
Foreign Field" could turn out to be the most moving of all the Normandy footage 
about to rain down upon us. 
</P>
<P>
 * "A Foreign Field" airs Sunday at 9 p.m. on KCET-TV Channel 28 and KPBS-TV 
Channel 15, and at 8 p.m. on KVCR-TV Channel 24. RAY LOYND

TV REVIEWS; LEARNING THE TRUTH ABOUT 'EARTHQUAKES' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT KOEHLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Manhattanites who think that earthquakes are "that L.A. thing" will find no 
comfort in ABC's self-descriptive special, "Earthquakes: The Terrifying Truth." 
The Big One, it says, could hit under New York, Memphis, Seattle or many other 
large U.S. urban centers. 
</P>
<P>
 For Southern Californians, however, the only relief in watching what is often 
a relentless montage of actual and movie-made quake footage is the program's 
vivid explanation of Tokyo as the world's most dangerous city for shakers. 
</P>
<P>
 The local future seismic dangers shown here -- the web of buried thrust faults 
underneath the L.A. basin, the stressed southern tip of the San Andreas Fault 
-- are familiar stuff. But Tokyo's vulnerability to the Big One is truly 
shocking. The city's building density, its soft soil, its location on four -- 
count 'em, four-tectonic plates, and an alleged illusion of preparedness (the 
annual "Disaster Day" appears to be more like a family outing than real 
preparation) make for a deadly combination. 
</P>
<P>
 Even worse is the prospect that the next great Tokyo quake could trigger a 
global economic battering, since assets to pay for damages would likely come 
from disinvestments overseas. The consequences could be enormous. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Earthquakes: The Terrifying Truth" airs at 8 tonight on ABC (Channels 7, 3, 
10 and 42).

TV REVIEWS; HEARTS ARE BROKEN IN 'SEASONS' DRAMA 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 "Seasons of the Heart" stars Carol Burnett, George Segal and Malcolm McDowell 
as three star-crossed urban sophisticates in a child abandonment drama directed 
by Lee Grant. 
</P>
<P>
 With a talent roster like that, it sounds like a can't-miss 
movie.Unfortunately, it does miss, scattering instead of harnessing its 
strengths so that little in the movie jells. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea behind Robbyn Burger's teleplay is promising enough: A drug-addicted 
mother (Jill Teed) abandons her 7-year-old son into the unwelcome arms of her 
wealthy publisher mom (Burnett) and the woman's philandering, raffish husband 
(Segal). 
</P>
<P>
 Grant draws a natural performance from her child actor (Eric Lloyd), who 
mirrors the tedium and confusion of suddenly being raised by unknown 
grandparents who are not exactly the Cleavers. In fact, they're often at each 
other's throats, peeling away the ghosts from their sexually promiscuous lives 
-- one of them a colleague of Burnett's (McDowell). 
</P>
<P>
 The trouble is that none of these disparate elements cohere very well and the 
characters are hard to root for. * "Seasons of the Heart" airs Sunday at 9 p.m. 
on NBC (Channels 4, 36 and 39). RAY LOYND

TV REVIEWS; DISASTER STRIKES IN 'WHITE MILE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WILLMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Much media focus has been directed recently on those many notorious CEOs who 
also happen to be outdoor thrill-seekers. So the vaguely fact-based HBO movie 
"White Mile" -- about the disastrous results of a corporate white-water rafting 
trip -- comes along at a trenchant time: It's "Barbarians at the Gate of 
Deliverance." 
</P>
<P>
 Alan Alda stars as Dan Cutler, the president of an L.A. ad agency, who invites 
-- nearly coerces, perhaps -- his underlings and some clients to come along on 
brotherhood/bonding adventures out of town. This time, they take to a river in 
the Canadian Rockies; never mind the Class 5 rapids, or the fact that there are 
too many weekend warriors -- some of them novices -- to safely fit in one 
craft. Those reluctant souls who would rather fly-fish don't speak up too 
loudly, lest they be marked as less than tigerish VP prospects. 
</P>
<P>
 Disaster strikes, of course, and nearly half the expedition is lost in the 
fearsome rapids. Back in the urban wilderness, the film focuses on the crisis 
of conscience of Peter Gallagher, Alda's loyal right-hand man, who's 
considering testifying in a lawsuit filed by the bitter widow of one of the 
lost men. 
</P>
<P>
 Scripter Michael Butler's setup is full of deft detail that neatly sketches 
the competitive ad-world backdrop. Alda is scarily convincing as a steely exec, 
and allows his character mortal shades of heroism, panic and regret in the 
crisis, if what he finally chooses to be is something other than human. 
</P>
<P>
 And in its middle river section, "White Mile" truly is white-knuckle stuff, 
with editing (by John Duffy) and direction (Robert Butler) that let us feel 
there really is a raft full of recognizable character actors (including Robert 
Loggia, Bruce Altman and Dakin Matthews) in literally dire straits. 
</P>
<P>
 Only in the third act does the drama grow less compelling, when the courtroom 
proceedings become predictable. Still, it's mostly fascinating sailing. And 
when motivator-in-chief Alda, sitting bloodied on a hospital gurney, recovers 
his gumption and resumes lecturing to his hires ("You know, there's a lesson 
here . . . "), anyone who ever navigated the business rapids may feel the chill 
of corporate hypothermia. 
</P>
<P>
 * "White Mile" premieres at 8 tonight on HBO, with repeats May 24 and 29 and 
June 1, 6, 9 and 11. CHRIS WILLMAN

DANCE REVIEW; 'BRISTLE' WORKS UP A STORM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS PASLES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Like other artists, choreographer Donald Byrd turned out to be more engaging 
when he painted a picture of hell than when he tried to paint a picture of 
heaven. Or call it demi-heaven, which may be as close as we can get to the real 
thing in the '90s. 
</P>
<P>
 In his latest three-act work, "Bristle," seen Thursday at the Irvine Barclay 
Theatre, Byrd progressed from cold sexual aggressivity through deconstructed 
Romanticism to interpersonal accommodation. The work closed the enterprising 
Feet First Contemporary Dance Series sponsored jointly by the theater and UCI 
Cultural Events. 
</P>
<P>
 Against a driving rhythmic score by Mio Morales, Byrd's longtime collaborator, 
four men and four women line up for a fierce, shifting and impersonal battle of 
the sexes in the sensational first part, "Sentimental Cannibalism." 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Blake, Friedrich Buhrer, Stephanie Guiland, Terace Jones, Aldawna 
Morrison, Diane Sales, Leonora Stapleton and Laura Rossini stalked through 
Byrd's rigorous, fast-paced geometries and met his extended balletic demands 
with rare power and clarity. 
</P>
<P>
 David H. Rosenburg's dramatic lighting design accentuated the battles. Ghostly 
quotations from Barber's Adagio for Strings lent momentary poignancy. 
</P>
<P>
 Choreographically, things began to go awry in Part II, "La Valse," which 
turned slowly away from Morales' music to Ravel's familiar score. 
</P>
<P>
 At first, the section suggested continuity, as the woman callously inspected 
the men's bodies; then the men returned the favor. Soon the guys lined up at 
the feet of the now spread-eagled women, and one by one had their way with 
them. Changing the lineup, the women took their turns. 
</P>
<P>
 But as "La Valse" continued, choreographic logic and impulse yielded to a 
theatrical concept that appeared imposed: Romanticism, represented by this 
score, had to die for new relationship to emerge. 
</P>
<P>
 We know that from interviews. Byrd found little to support the idea in Ravel's 
sinuous line -- although he did capture the composer's explosive accents. 
Neither did he work against the music persuasively. The section began to fill 
with dead time. 
</P>
<P>
 The third part, "Quartet," admitted only two couples -- Morrison and April 
Wanstall, and Blake and Stapleton. The odds of male-female relationship getting 
even this far, Byrd may be saying, are only 50-50. There remained tensions, 
feints and withdrawals, but also increasing trust and tenderness. 
</P>
<P>
 Visually, however, there was less and less to interest the eye as the storms 
subsided into calm, lyric stretchings, difficult balances and final 
sexual/emotional embraces. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bristle" is exclusively heterosexual and reflects none of the pan-sexual 
partnerings Byrd has explored in some previous works. Even so, the Rev. Donald 
E. Wildmon, his American Family Assn. and others of their ilk probably still 
wouldn't approve. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Bristle" will be danced by Donald Byrd/The GroupC today at 8 p.m. at UC 
Riverside's University Theatre, $20, (909) 787-4331; and on Sunday at 8 p.m. at 
the Japan America Theatre, 244 S . San Pedro St., Los Angeles, $14 and $16,

OUTDOORS; LIFE AT THE TOP; TREEHOUSES CAN BE PLAIN OR FANCY; WHAT THEY REQUIRE 
IS SENSE OF FUN AND EYE FOR SAFETY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARESA ARCHER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fans of the "Calvin and Hobbes" comic strip understand how important a tree 
house can be to a kid. For one thing, it's the place where young Calvin and his 
imaginary tiger pal hatch plans to drop water bombs on poor, unsuspecting 
Susie. 
</P>
<P>
 From literature to Hollywood movies, any self-respecting kid with a tree seems 
to build some sort of shelter in its branches. 
</P>
<P>
 But, as well as the idea of kids and treehouses seem to go together, Orange 
County neighborhoods seem to have an abundance of kids and very few treehouses. 
</P>
<P>
 At least part of the lack can be laid to a shortage of decent-sized trees 
worthy of house building. Much of the county is made up of new communities 
where there were few trees to begin with or where they were razed to make way 
for housing developments. 
</P>
<P>
 Zoning laws and regulations adopted by home associations also work to keep 
tree dwellings to a minimum. Many new neighborhoods in the county have 
restrictions about everything from house color to jungle-gym size. These are 
not places that usually tolerate treehouses. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, there are treehouses perched here and there. They range from a 
weathered model in a Costa Mesa back yard to the concrete-rooted one at 
Disneyland, from a controversially placed one in Laguna Beach to one 
comfortably tucked into in a back-yard pine in Anaheim that's a favorite of 
children in the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Zoning departments in many Orange County cities have a pretty relaxed attitude 
about treehouses. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't really regulate them at all," said Roger Garry, code enforcement 
officer for Brea. "As long as it's under 120 square feet. If it's out in the 
front-yard area, we check to see if it's compatible with zoning aspects, but 
we've never really had a problem with them." 
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim, Placentia, Irvine, Huntington Beach and Costa Mesa have similar 
policies regarding treehouses: As long as they are less than one story high 
(anywhere from six to eight feet, depending on the city) and under 120 square 
feet and comply with the city's setback laws, they are not required to have 
building permits. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't really get very involved with treehouses," said Mary Beth Ormsby, an 
associate planner for Huntington Beach. "The only time we'd get involved is if 
there was a complaint, and then we'd check it out." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For the person considering building a treehouse, consultation with neighbors 
and a check with the city zoning department are advised before construction. It 
can prevent problems later.  
</P>
<P>
 There are a lot of plans for building on-ground playhouses, but not for 
treehouses. Each one needs to be custom-built to the tree and interests of the 
kids who will be using it.  
</P>
<P>
 It's very important to chose a sturdy tree -- one that will be able to stand 
up to the stress of construction and climbing. It's not necessary for a 
treehouse to be very high off the ground. Even with a safe design, falls can 
happen. 
</P>
<P>
 Construction should be sturdy and the climb to and from should be simple. 
Additional safety issues to keep in mind are solid bracing, side rails or walls 
to prevent falls and a splinter-free finish. After a treehouse is built, it 
should be inspected regularly to make sure it remains safe. Watch kids at play 
in it to see if there are ways to make it safer. Sometimes one more board can 
help prevent an accident.  
</P>
<P>
 While plans can become grand, it's good to remember that simple materials and 
design are often just as attractive to a child as complex ones: A treehouse is 
built most of all in the imagination. 
</P>
<P>
 From the simple to the grand, here is how four of Orange County's treehouses 
have fared: Old Favorite 
</P>
<P>
 In an unincorporated area near Costa Mesa, high in a eucalyptus, sits a 
treehouse that once must have been a grand little playhouse but now has faded 
green paint and no glass in its windows. 
</P>
<P>
 Faded or not, the more than 20-year-old treehouse is still bringing joy to 
kids. 
</P>
<P>
 The treehouse sits in the back yard of Gary Elder, who doesn't really need a 
treehouse but was pleased to have it there when he bought the property six 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not married and don't have any kids," he said. He had a carpenter look 
the house over and make sure it was still sound. "I had the old carpet and 
glass removed for safety reasons," said Elder. "My nephews and friends' kids 
like playing up there." 
</P>
<P>
 The treehouse has been a part of the neighborhood for so long that at least 
some consider it a treasure. One neighbor, who has a great view of the 
treehouse from her back yard, says that to her it's as good as an ocean view. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just an old, funky thing, not all new or styled out. It's like a work of 
art," Lynette Vieira said. Modern Amenities 
</P>
<P>
 In the back yard of the Clark family home in Anaheim is a treehouse designed 
by Tom Sendro for his two granddaughters. With the help of son-in-law Doug, 
Sendro built it in the branching trunk of a back-yard pine. 
</P>
<P>
 The treehouse is used mostly by 7 1/2-year-old Allison (her younger sister, 
Heather, 2, is too little to climb up without adult accompaniment). "The house 
is about 10 1/2 feet off the ground," said the girls' mom, Julia Clark. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the treehouse went up two years ago, the Clarks asked their neighbors 
whether they would object; no one did. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clarks made sure the treehouse was attractive. It's green to blend in with 
the tree. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't look like some child made it out of leftover lumber," Clark said. 
"It's not an eyesore. It looks real cute." 
</P>
<P>
 The treehouse has a balcony, shuttered windows and staircase with handrail. 
The first few steps of the staircase are covered with a removable plastic 
shield that prevents Heather from climbing up but is easily managed by Allison 
and her friends. There is also a pulley system so that no child has to climb up 
the stairs with arms full of toys. The pulley also makes it easier to send up 
snacks. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside there are a child-size table, four chairs and chalkboards. Despite a 
yard full of children's attractions, such as a tetherball court and swimming 
pool, the treehouse remains the most popular among kids. 
</P>
<P>
 "We always ask kids that come over to play what they like the best. Always 
it's the treehouse," Clark said. Battle Ground 
</P>
<P>
 In Laguna Beach, complaints from a neighbor resulted in the city's ordering 
the removal of a back-yard treehouse earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The structure had been built by the Castillo family as a birthday gift for son 
Andrew. The 10-foot-by-5-foot treehouse sports a balcony and a skylight and 
cost $3,200 to build. 
</P>
<P>
 A neighbor who lives uphill from the Castillos complained to the city that the 
treehouse -- snuggled between two eucalyptus trees and secured by ropes -- 
blocks his ocean view and allows for a clear view onto his property. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's Design Review Board decided in February that the treehouse should 
be moved to a location that would neither annoy neighbors nor require a zoning 
variance. 
</P>
<P>
 At last report, the treehouse was still in place -- with the Castillos and the 
city mulling their next moves. Concrete Fantasy 
</P>
<P>
 The grandest of treehouses may well be the Swiss Family Robinson treehouse at 
Disneyland. Standing 60 feet tall since the park opened, the treehouse has been 
visited by 300 million people, according to a Disneyland spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 Closed in February for some refurbishing and remodeling, the treehouse was 
reopened in March. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike your neighborhood variety of treehouse, the Disney structure boasts 
turn-of-the-century antiques, including an organ, a ship's light and a 
barometer. It sleeps six and has its own water supply via a bamboo waterwheel. 
</P>
<P>
 How can a tree support such grandeur? Ah, well, the Disneyland tree is made of 
150 tons of concrete, six tons of reinforced steel and has more than 300,000 
hand-painted leaves for that natural effect. 
</P>
<P>
 And unlike most run-of-the-mill trees, this one has concrete roots that reach 
42 feet into the ground.

FURNISHINGS; GOT A MINUTE? MAKE MOVING A SNAP; SOME ASSEMBLY REQUIRED 
</P>

<P>
 For anyone who has ever dragged a 91-inch couch up a long flight of stairs or 
attempted to shove a massive entertainment unit through a doorway the size of a 
keyhole, there's good news in the furniture department. 
</P>
<P>
 Furniture manufacturers have come up with couches, sofas and other home 
furnishings that can be pulled apart and snapped together again as easy as 
Legos. 
</P>
<P>
 New advances in ready-to-assemble furniture are especially designed for highly 
mobile areas such as Orange County, where people never seem to stay in one 
place for long. Come moving day, it's simple to break down a bulky sofa or love 
seat and transfer it in pieces to its new destination. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the most talked-about developments in the ready-to-assemble category is 
a line of upholstered sofas, love seats and chairs called Simply Together that 
the manufacturer says can be easily assembled or taken apart -- without tools 
-- in three minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 When delivered, a Simply Together sofa comes in three large boxes weighing 
less than 50 pounds that can be carried up stairways, into elevators or through 
narrow doorways. 
</P>
<P>
 Produced by Masco Corp., a huge furniture manufacturer based in High Point, 
N.C., the Simply Together line is unique because the modular pieces hook 
together to look just like traditional upholstered furniture. 
</P>
<P>
 "The mentality of some people is if it can be assembled, then the quality 
can't be there," says Linda Jones, executive consultant to Masco. 
</P>
<P>
 To prove the skeptics wrong, Masco invited the home furnishings media to the 
Four Seasons Hotel in New York City several months ago to see how Simply 
Together works. Masco representatives put one of the Simply Together sofas 
under a spotlight. 
</P>
<P>
 After demonstrating how the sofa could be taken apart and reassembled in 
minutes, the representatives announced to the audience that the sofas and 
chairs they were sitting on in the hotel salon were all Simply Together pieces. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people literally jumped out of their seats," Jones says. 
</P>
<P>
 The company is touting the sofas as the solution for people living in 
second-floor apartments and condominiums who have had trouble moving furniture 
into tight living spaces. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a very mobile society," Jones said. "Plus, we all have occasions when 
the carpet cleaner comes and we need to move the furniture." 
</P>
<P>
 Furniture designer Bruce Hirschhaut, upholsterer Glenn Laughlin and marketing 
specialist Jeff Frank came up with the idea of knockdown furniture. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a thought process. We asked ourselves, 'What's not being done in 
upholstery in the United States that we think we can do?' " Hirschhaut says. 
</P>
<P>
 The trio wanted to make furniture that was mobile but heftier and more durable 
than lightweight futons and foam sofas. They spent three years working nights 
and weekends to create the line. 
</P>
<P>
 "The challenge was to come up with a perfect piece of upholstery that could 
fit anywhere," Hirschhaut says. 
</P>
<P>
 While most sofas have a hardwood frame, the knockdown sofa has a steel frame 
and pre-assembled coil suspension system that snaps in place. 
</P>
<P>
 "The structure resembles a bed frame," Jones says. (The sofas can convert into 
sleepers and back again by lifting up the front rail, removing the seat box and 
sliding in a $100 sleeper unit.) 
</P>
<P>
 Masco, which bought the idea from the inventors, now offers the furniture in 
12 styles, from traditional to contemporary. Priced from about $500 to $900, 
they are available in assorted fabrics, including florals, woven velvets and 
herringbone. Other design features include roll-pleated arms, fan-pleated roll 
arms, welt-trimmed skirt detailing and either matching or coordinating toss 
pillows. 
</P>
<P>
 Other ready-to-assemble products, such as the entertainment centers and wall 
units made by O'Sullivan Industries of Lamar, Mo., have been around for years. 
What's changed is how consumers put them together. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Sullivan has begun selling units that go together with a Velcro-like 
material called Vel Latch. 
</P>
<P>
 While that might sound a bit like using masking tape to build a bookcase, the 
company assures consumers that once the units are up they won't go anywhere -- 
unless one pulls them apart. 
</P>
<P>
 "Furniture manufacturing has become so sophisticated that now they can make a 
product that's ready-to-assemble that looks really nice," said Jim Hillman, 
vice president of human resources for O'Sullivan. "A furniture expert can tell, 
but the general public has a difficult time." 
</P>
<P>
 Other pieces by O'Sullivan fasten together through a metal locking system.  
</P>
<P>
 The bookshelves, microwave stands, file cabinets and other furnishings are 
made of particle wood with an oak or other finish that looks like solid wood 
and sell for under $100 to $600. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the Simply Together line, however, these are not as easy to take apart 
once consumers have put them together. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Simply Together furnishings are available through the QVC shopping channel 
(call (800)-345-1515 for a free brochure on Item No. M1634), Plunkett Furniture 
((800) SOFA123 for a free brochure), Spiegel and JCPenney catalogues. Once 
ordered, a sofa usually takes less than a week to arrive at the customer's 
doorstep.  
</P>
<P>
 O'Sullivan products are carried at Surroundings in Tustin, Design Source in 
Fountain Valley and Today's Furniture in Orange.

FURNISHINGS; MANUFACTURERS TAKE CONTEMPORARY CUES FROM BEST OF THE PAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA MAYER, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The opening-day conference at the recent spring furniture market in High 
Point, N.C., asked the question, "What is contemporary?" 
</P>
<P>
 A number of manufacturers already had working definitions, and they accounted 
for some of the most lively and noteworthy pieces introduced at the semiannual 
wholesale trade show. The furniture will be in retail stores in late summer or 
early fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Contemporary has a golden haze in the hands of Parish-Hadley Associates Inc. 
The New York interior-design firm created 42 new items for Baker Furniture. A 
number of them are adaptations of the firm's custom designs. 
</P>
<P>
 Gilding is used on the frames and surfaces of several cabinets, tables and 
mirrors. The legs and upholstery of an armless leather side chair, for example, 
are touched with gold tone, and a home-entertainment cabinet of simulated 
goatskin has a gilded iron frame. Most of the pieces were characterized by 
Albert Hadley as "beige with a vengeance." 
</P>
<P>
 A quiet palette also dominated Dakota Jackson's designs for the Lane Co., his 
first venture into mass market for the home. Jackson, a New York designer, is 
known for limited-edition pieces for celebrities as diverse as Yoko Ono and 
Jerry Seinfeld. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson's straight-lined cabinets in blond ash wood mix with round glass 
tables on sinuous metal bases and chubby upholstered seating in a 60-item 
collection for living room, bedroom and dining room. 
</P>
<P>
 At Milling Road, a subsidiary of Baker, contemporary becomes a reprise of the 
best designs of the 20th Century. It starts with a cabinet that owes a great 
deal to Charles Rennie Mackintosh and works up to a 1950s-style rounded armless 
sofa in a boucle-like fabric, also reminiscent of the era. 
</P>
<P>
 Confirming a general trend away from suites, or matched sets, the furniture is 
in "classic forms that work with existing pieces," according to Richard E. 
Vaughn, vice president and general manager. They are more adaptations than 
direct copies. A 1950s-style chair, for example, is upholstered in Polarfleece, 
a high-tech fabric used for active wear. 
</P>
<P>
 A year ago at the shows, the British colonial design theme was introduced and 
has done well since it arrived at retail in the fall. More is on the way, 
Drexel's new Collector's Mahogany group among them. A rattan and wicker chest 
with mirror inserts and bamboo edging looks as if an English planter ordered it 
from one of the colonies. 
</P>
<P>
 Several manufacturers are contributing to a tropical air with chairs and sofas 
upholstered in woven reed, including Hickory Chair Co., Lineage, Pearson, Ralph 
Lauren and Lane in its New Country Gear collection. Lane's seating by Raymond 
Waites even has the option of reed-covered cushions. 
</P>
<P>
 Beds stand to be the sleeper of the new season. Almost every manufacturer has 
a show-stopper. A signature piece from the Dakota Jackson collection is made of 
"woven" bronze-colored steel strips. Parish-Hadley did a skinny four-poster in 
bright red lacquer with a metal finial not unlike a pineapple. 
</P>
<P>
 Several showrooms offer wood and metal combinations. The four-poster in 
Thomasville's new Stone Terrace group, for example, has chunky oak posts, a 
pewter-finish metal canopy and a latticework headboard. 
</P>
<P>
 Many sofas and chairs have a soft, squashy 1950s feel, not only in well-known 
brands such as Thayer Coggin, but in numerous obscure seating lines as well.

 Q We have long had a problem with our bathroom door swinging open and bashing

 A You may want to think of another solution, says Gloria Richey of Tile 
Importers in Anaheim. Whether you drill through the tile or the grout, you're 
risking some damage to the tile. You may get better protection by attaching 
some kind of rubber guard to the door so that it doesn't get damaged when it 
hits the toilet. If you really want to go with the doorstop, use a new tile bit 
and drill through the grout to the subfloor. If you have to go through the 
tile, put a piece of tape on the area you'll be drilling to keep it from 
breaking.

 A There probably is some loss, says Jim Grant of Dutch Boy Home Decorating 
Center in Santa Ana. It's probably an oil-based sealer, which isn't sold 
anymore because of air quality regulations, and oil-based sealers tend to 
crystallize over time. While using it for your gate is probably a great way to 
get rid of the sealer (you won't have to take it to a hazardous waste center), 
there's probably going to be some loss of quality. You're ultimately better off 
using a modern water-based sealer or one that has an emulsified oil base.

one inexpensively. Spray-paint it the color of the refrigerator and it will

before putting them in the wash.

 A Paperhanger Steve Bella of San Juan Capistrano says you won't have much 
luck. Getting paper to stick on some indoor walls is hard enough, but making it 
stay outdoors would be just about impossible. If you are determined, try a 
heavy-duty vinyl paper; buy a small roll, put a piece in an inconspicuous area 
and see what happens. With the range of humidity and temperature changes 
outside, it will probably soon peel off.

STORAGE; AN OUNCE OF PREVENTION WEIGHS AGAINST MOTHS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Moths don't cause damage, but their larvae do. 
</P>
<P>
 Adult clothes moths are buff or yellowish in color and have a wingspan of 
about one-half inch. Females lay eggs in clothing and other fabrics; larvae 
hatch from the eggs and feed on the fabric. 
</P>
<P>
 Fully grown larvae are one-half-inch long white worms with dark heads. They 
feed not only on clothing but on blankets, rugs, carpets, drapes, pillows, 
upholstery and brushes. They feed on any item made of wool or other natural 
fiber. 
</P>
<P>
 To battle moths in storage areas, keep areas clean, dry, free of insects and 
away from light, which can promote hatching of insect eggs. Moderate, even 
cool, temperatures and humidity are best. Avoid extremes such as a hot attic or 
a damp basement. 
</P>
<P>
 Prepare the storage area by vacuuming thoroughly, especially in floor cracks 
and crevices. Empty the cleaner bag immediately after use. It may contain eggs, 
larvae or adult moths. Then sprinkle mothballs, flakes or crystals according to 
manufacturer's directions. 
</P>
<P>
 Because mothballs and crystals emit a vapor that is heavier than air, also 
suspend some in containers above the clothing. Old stockings or socks make good 
bags for mothballs. Or sprinkle moth crystals on the sticky side of masking 
tape and hang them. 
</P>
<P>
 Mothballs, flakes or crystals are poisonous, so don't scatter them where 
children or pets can reach them.  
</P>
<P>
 Mothballs and crystals won't kill moth eggs that are already present in wool, 
other natural fibers or fur. Launder or dry-clean garments made of these 
materials to destroy the eggs before storing. 
</P>
<P>
 A more time-consuming and less effective method is to air the garments in the 
sun. 
</P>
<P>
 Shake them vigorously and brush them well on both sides, turning out pockets, 
seams and linings. Soft or napped fabrics are likely to harbor the eggs even 
after this treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 Store clean clothes in sturdy cardboard boxes, plastic garment bags with 
zippered closings, or clean trash cans with tight lids. Sprinkle moth flakes or 
crystals inside the containers, following label directions or use moth 
repellent cakes. But don't store leather and fur garments in airtight 
containers; they need to "breathe." 
</P>
<P>
 You can use moth-repellent substitutes for mothballs. If you can't find sachet 
bags, make your own out of cheesecloth, clean baby socks, old clean nylon 
stockings or pantyhose. 
</P>
<P>
 Fill these with any combination of cedar chips, dried lavender, aromatic pipe 
tobacco, whole peppercorns or a 50-50 mixture of dried rosemary and mint. Try a 
pet store for cedar chips; a health food store should carry the herbs. 
</P>
<P>
 Moths appear to hate newsprint, so try packing out-of-season clothing in 
newspapers. Garments on hangers can be wrapped in several layers of newspapers 
with all openings sealed with strong tape. Roll newspapers inside rugs before 
storing them. 
</P>
<P>
 Cedar chests and closets will keep out moths only if they have no gaps or open 
seams, and if made of cedar heartwood at least three-quarters of an inch thick. 
Seal the closet door with weatherstripping and a cedar chest with felt 
gasketing to make them airtight. 
</P>
<P>
 Although cedar will kill newly hatched or young worms, it won't kill eggs, 
half-grown worms, the pupae or chrysalis enclosed in cases or cocoons, or 
moths. 
</P>
<P>
 Try cedar in your other closets and chests. It's nonpoisonous and comes in 
blocks, chips, shavings, hangers and drawer liners.

DECORATING; GIVE GLAZED WALLS A COMBING FOR A FRESH LOOK

<TEXT>
<P>
 If you loved finger painting or block printing as a child, you can relive the 
magic by trying decorative wall-painting. 
</P>
<P>
 More subtle than patterned wallpapers and more elaborate than plain painted 
surfaces, this popular art form is easy and can dramatically alter a room's 
appearance. 
</P>
<P>
 All you need are glaze, a few improvised tools and a measure of playfulness -- 
the same ingredient that made childhood art so much fun. 
</P>
<P>
 Glaze is a semitransparent paint that you apply over a base coat of ordinary 
wall paint. The two paints usually are different colors. 
</P>
<P>
 The most common method is to brush or roll on glaze and then rub, blot or 
scrape -- or a combination of these techniques -- before it dries, so that the 
base coat shows through, creating a pattern. 
</P>
<P>
 The base coat can be either latex or alkyd. It should have a satin or 
semi-gloss luster and be completely dry. Another method is to alter the glaze 
when applying it, producing a more clearly defined pattern. You can treat a 
whole room or decorate only one wall. 
</P>
<P>
 Among tools you can use are rags, sponges, brushes and combs. It's a good idea 
for two people to work together when applying glaze. One brushes or rolls on 
the glaze while the other follows to create a pattern. When glazing an entire 
room, work on one wall and then the opposite to avoid overlapping wet glaze in 
the corners. 
</P>
<P>
 Paint stores carry glaze, or you can make your own. A simple and effective 
recipe is to stir together one part each of alkyd paint and paint thinner, and 
then add one part transparent glazing liquid.  
</P>
<P>
 Stir the combined ingredients thoroughly and then brush or roll some onto 
matte board painted with a sample of the base coat as a test. The glaze should 
be thin but not runny. To thicken glaze, add more paint; to thin, add paint 
thinner. To increase transparency, add more glazing liquid. 
</P>
<P>
 Alkyd glazes are rather shiny and dry slowly, allowing ample time for pattern 
changes. 
</P>
<P>
 Alkyd base products are toxic and have strong fumes, so it's wise to wear a 
respirator and rubber gloves when handling them. Work in a well-ventilated 
area, and keep pets and children away. You can also concoct glazes from latex 
paint that are safer to use, but these are somewhat cloudy and may dry too 
quickly for beginners. 
</P>
<P>
 Here are the most popular ways of applying glaze: 
</P>
<P>
 * Simple patterning: Blot the glaze firmly with a wadded paper towel or 
lint-free cloth. Rotate your hand often, to keep the pattern random. 
Periodically expose a clean surface of the material or switch to a fresh piece. 
</P>
<P>
 * Sponging: Pat a sea sponge dampened with solvent against the surface, 
changing the position often. Avoid squeezing the sponge. 
</P>
<P>
 * Stippling: Firmly press a stippling brush or a stiff-bristled scrub brush 
into the glaze. Keep the brush from sliding. Clean the bristles frequently by 
wiping them on a clean cloth. 
</P>
<P>
 * Rag rolling: Shape a lint-free cloth about 1 foot square onto a loose 
cylinder, then roll it down the wall in vertical strips, overlapping each 
slightly. 
</P>
<P>
 * Combing: Hold a large steel or rubber graining comb at a 45-degree angle to 
the wall surface. Drag it down, forming straight or wavy lines as desired. Do 
not overlap rows. Clean the comb at the end of each stroke. 
</P>
<P>
 Stippling brushes and graining combs are available from specialty paint or art 
supply stores.

CARVING OUT A SPOT WHEN THERE'S NO ROOM TO SPARE

 "We all have a bit of Virginia Woolf in us," says decorator Charlotte Moss. 
"We want to have a room of our own." 
</P>
<P>
 And to demonstrate that it can be done even when there's no room to spare, 
Moss redid a passageway as a tiny study in the show house at the Sara Delano 
home. The windowless 5-by-12-foot passageway became a hideaway for lounging and 
desk work, furnished with a love seat, desk, chair and sofa table. Pocket doors 
at one end can close off the area. 
</P>
<P>
 To disguise features that couldn't be moved and to create a special identity, 
she tented the entire room with the same interesting French-toile fabric. This 
printed fabric in cream and 12 gradations of brown is the most important 
ingredient, Moss says. It unifies an area broken up by exposed pipes and 
utility boxes, yet supplies the detail people crave in a tiny space. 
</P>
<P>
 Using a visual trick to make the narrow room seem wider, she replaced a closet 
door with a windowed door and hung a mirror on the back wall inside a small 
closet off the passageway. 
</P>
<P>
 On the opposite wall of the room, she created a "window" by punctuating the 
surface of a square mirror with mullions. Curtains at either side of the settee 
and a canopy above it also make the room look bigger.

DECORATING; F.D.R. HOUSE: SMALL ROOMS, BIG CHALLENGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Pull the curtains closed, turn out the lights and slip under the filmy white 
linens on Ronald Bricke's towering, velvet-draped bed. But don't doze off. The 
show has just begun. "In the dark, the bed glows," said Bricke, designer to 
Broadway and real-estate moguls. "It's like E.T. landed." 
</P>
<P>
 That's only the optical impact of a bed hung floor to ceiling with gossamer 
white fabric, then encased in charcoal velvet and placed free-standing in the 
center of his dark-gray room. 
</P>
<P>
 For a slightly eerier effect, flick a switch and start the movie projector 
hidden above your head. Nestle into pillows trimmed with rare, 1930s Venetian 
lace as a personal movie screen descends from the canopy overhead. All you have 
to do is stay awake. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's your own private theater in bed," Bricke said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bricke's artful concoction of high-tech and old lace is the highlight of the 
22nd annual Kips Bay Decorator Show House in New York. For the event, which 
benefits the Kips Bay Boys and Girls Club in the Bronx, 14 of New York's top 
interior designers and five artisans transformed rooms, landings and closets, 
though none with quite the elan of Bricke. 
</P>
<P>
 The impact of hard times on the decorating industry appears to have restrained 
even the most expansive of high-end decorators. Still, Kips Bay remains an 
exceptional, sometimes outlandish source of style and a context in which 
imagination need not be restrained by the pocketbook. 
</P>
<P>
 Take Bricke's master bedroom. Technologically astute visitors will appreciate 
the Vidikron single-gun video projector, which has been adjusted to project on 
a 27-inch screen just 80 inches away. Mark Hader, owner of Audio Video Systems 
in Williston Park, N.Y., which devised the system, says the projector's 
built-in line doubler allows it to produce "a phenomenal picture" at this 
distance. But figure $11,000 for equipment and installation. The bed is extra. 
</P>
<P>
 But even here, decorators face challenges, the location among them. This 
year's show house took place in a five-story, double townhouse on East 65th 
Street commissioned in 1907-08 by Sara Delano Roosevelt for herself and her 
son, Franklin. A single facade hides identical houses that share a common 
entry, with dining rooms and parlors that could be joined, as well as a 
communicating door on the fourth floor. It was designed by Charles A. Platt. 
</P>
<P>
 Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt used their half until 1942, a year after Sara 
died. The house was purchased by Hunter College and named the Sara Delano 
Roosevelt Interfaith Memorial House. Student and community events took place 
there until 1992, when the house was closed for financial reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the Committee for the Restoration of Roosevelt House, which includes 
Roosevelt family members and friends, is exploring the house's future. It is 
listed in the National Register of Historic Places. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite its lineage, the building wasn't particularly grand from a decorator's 
point of view. Except for the double parlor connecting the two houses on the 
second floor, rooms are smallish by Kips Bay standards. Moreover, the cove 
ceilings, at 9 feet, 3 inches, were unregally low. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most decorators of this level are dealing with better buildings than this," 
said Scott Salvator, who bemoaned the lack of elegant detailing. 
</P>
<P>
 Salvator painted stripes on the ceiling of his guest room to heighten it and 
hung a Russian chandelier in the middle to give it the look of a tent. With his 
partner, Michael Zabriskie, he also draped 150 yards of Quadrille linen toile 
over dubious walls. The fabric is white, taupe and "shrimp pink" with a 
neo-classical motif. 
</P>
<P>
 Toile was the favored fabric of Charlotte Moss, who draped 50 yards of "Toile 
Venetienne" from Travers over a daybed and walls. Toile turned up again in a 
very bright tricolor from Manuel Canovas on the sofa of Noel Jeffrey's library. 
</P>
<P>
 "Toile is the chintz of the '90s," proclaimed Salvator. 
</P>
<P>
 No such fleeting trends were on Tom O'Toole's mind when he designed the F.D.R. 
library, in which some books remain from Roosevelt days. "The upholstery should 
last 50 years," he said. "Slipcover it in 10." The valances and curtains could 
withstand "decades." 
</P>
<P>
 The Aubusson rug, the antique table, the English-made sofa, the club chairs, 
the ceiling painting copied from a courthouse, the walls faux-painted to look 
like old sandstone, the fabrics from Boussac of France, all were designed to 
look timeless, as if succeeding generations of Roosevelts had lived there. 
</P>
<P>
 "Things have changed since the crash," he said. "Suggested list prices in some 
decorator showrooms seem ridiculous." 
</P>
<P>
 To hold down costs without sacrificing style, O'Toole said, he chose basic 
chairs "like a little black dress," then added fancy details. A special pocket 
for magazines on a chaise cost an extra $50, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 To cut the seriousness, O'Toole added antique toy boats and tuned his radio to 
a jazz station. "I don't think Vivaldi is what this room needs," he said.

HOME SAFETY; ELEMENTS OF DOUBT KEEP BURGLARS AT BAY

<P>
 At first you don't notice the empty space where the TV and VCR used to be. 
What catches your eye is the overturned end table, then the littered floor and 
the scattered fragments of a crystal lamp your mother adored. 
</P>
<P>
 Statistics from government crime reporting agencies show that residences 
account for two out of three burglaries in the United State. Several million 
occur yearly, with roughly one in six of the nation's 55 million homes taking a 
hit. Losses average $1,250 per household. 
</P>
<P>
 Forcible entry occurs in 70% of these cases. Most of the action takes place 
from 6 p.m. to midnight and when the weather is pleasant and warm. Doors -- 
front and back -- account for the most popular means of access at 63%. Windows 
place a distant second, just one in four. 
</P>
<P>
 Police and other experts caution that there's no perfect or fail-safe security 
system, only levels of deterrence. The more, the better. In home security, the 
same rules apply as for street crime -- the less vulnerable a target appears, 
the less likely it is to be attacked. Most criminals prefer the path of least 
resistance. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the most effective deterrents are the easiest to implement. Common 
sense measures, such as leaving lights on when you're not home, and having your 
lights work on timers, are effective because they place doubts in a would-be 
burglar's mind, or somehow tip the odds against an easy job. 
</P>
<P>
 After lights, your best deterrent may be a growling dog. Even a "Beware of 
Dog" sign on the premises is better than nothing. The crook may think it's 
phony, but you've planted a doubt. 
</P>
<P>
 A real dog isn't likely to remain behind when you leave home for a vacation. 
But a home security system stays on the job as long as there's electricity, or 
batteries to feed it. 
</P>
<P>
 There's no lack of home security products and alarm systems on the market. The 
products come as simple as a one-size-fits-all rotary timer for lights and 
appliances. Or, they can be as comprehensive as a home-automation program in 
your personal computer. 
</P>
<P>
 Trouble indicators include eardrum-piercing alarms and disorienting strobe 
lights. 
</P>
<P>
 External sirens and flashing lights can signal an alert outside the home. Some 
top-shelf systems even phone or radio for help.

ENVIRONMENT; NONTOXIC PAINT HOLDS UP TO COMPETITION

<P>
 "Green," or nontoxic, paint passes the smell test, but how does it hold up on 
the walls? 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, Consumer Reports and Environmental Building News announced the 
results of tests on Glidden Spred 2000, the first product from a major 
manufacturer that eliminates solvents containing chemicals thought to make some 
people sick. 
</P>
<P>
 Claiming it has zero volatile organic compounds (VOCs), ICI Chemicals & 
Polymers Ltd., Glidden's parent company, launched the nontoxic latex paint in 
mid-1992. It is priced competitively with other standard paints, around $18 or 
$20 per gallon. 
</P>
<P>
 Consumer Reports measured Spred 2000's VOC content at between 0.6% and 2% by 
weight. Benjamin Moore Aquavelvet contained 77 grams per liter, or 3% by 
weight. 
</P>
<P>
 Environmental Building News found that Spred 2000 and its industrial 
counterpart, Lifemaster 2000, "go on and perform almost exactly like 
conventional latex paints in the same price range."  
</P>
<P>
 But, citing unpublished test results by another paint company, the newsletter 
said Spred 2000 came out "far below" the other 16 high-end flat latex wall 
paints tested for scrub resistance. 
</P>
<P>
 Consumer Reports confirms that opinion. "It resisted staining very well but 
didn't hold up to scrubbing."  
</P>
<P>
 Dennis Scott, manager of the Technical Assistance Center at Glidden, said the 
scrub tests on flat latex paint were conducted with highly abrasive brushes 
that a homeowner would never use. 
</P>
<P>
 A number of small companies, such as Livos Plantchemistry of Santa Fe, N.M.; 
AFM Enterprises of Riverside, and the Old-Fashioned Milk Paint Co. in Groton, 
Mass., have been producing paints made of natural resins or nontoxic synthetics 
for more than a decade.

 BOB'S OTHER BOOKS: Excerpts from the new H.R. (Bob) Haldeman book, based on 
his diaries, present a dark side to Richard Nixon that contrasts sharply to 
tributes at his funeral in Yorba Linda last month. Yet Haldeman -- fired as 
White House chief of staff during Watergate -- had kept close ties to Nixon. . 
. . He was a visitor and guest speaker at the Richard Nixon Library & 
Birthplace in Yorba Linda several times. Also, a few months before his death 
last year, Haldeman donated his personal library collection to the Nixon 
library. 
</P>
<P>
 NIXON'S SMILE: Nixon's last visit to his presidential library was in January. 
But New York magazine this month ran a picture of Nixon taken at the time his 
staff had not expected. . . . He'd been strolling alone at the beach near the 
Ritz-Carlton hotel in Dana Point, in gray flannel slacks, when he came across 
children modeling for Child magazine. Nixon suggested they have their picture 
taken together. Says the magazine's fashion editor, Gay Empson: "He didn't seem 
like he wanted to leave." 
</P>
<P>
 WORK LEFT: Dorothy Mummert of Newport Beach has been styling hair at Fashion 
Island for nine years. But she's leaving it all -- and her grown daughter -- 
next month to teach English for the Peace Corps in Poland. "Before you leave 
this planet, you'd like to think you contributed," she says. "I don't feel I've 
done that yet." . . . She earned her teaching certificate in spare time. 
Mummert says she'll stay in touch with her barber customers. More than 100 have 
signed up to get her newsletter from Poland. 
</P>
<P>
 BOX DANCING: Can boxing be fun if you never get to see your opponent crumble 
to the canvas? Boxercising is the latest exercise craze at some local health 
clubs. You make all the boxing moves -- with the gloves -- against your 
opponent without striking him -- or usually her. Says Krys Golanski, who 
teaches the new class at the Sports Club/Irvine: "It's a great cardiovascular 
workout. But we only hit hands, not faces. That would be an ugly class."

 British U.N. soldiers moved into positions on a mountaintop overlooking 
Sarajevo on Friday to try and defuse tension between Serbian and Muslim-led 
forces. 
</P>
<P>
 About 30 soldiers from the Royal Anglian Regiment cleared brush and parked 
armored vehicles in the remnants of an old shepherds' village on Mt. Igman, 
setting up an observation post to monitor a shaky cease-fire around the Bosnian 
capital. 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. peacekeeping officials said eventually 160 British soldiers would deploy 
on Mt. Igman, which was the scene of heavy fighting earlier in the war. 
</P>
<P>
 Bosnian Serbs withdrew last year from Mt. Igman and another strategic peak on

HENRY MORGAN; IRREVERENT RADIO, TV PERSONALITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BURT A. FOLKART, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Henry Morgan, the irreverent, satiric entertainment personality whose 
trademark impudence led to a McCarthy-era blacklisting that he overcame using 
the grit and wit for which he was famous, has died. 
</P>
<P>
 The Associated Press reported Friday that the former three-pack-a-day smoker 
died of lung cancer Thursday at his Manhattan home (where the welcome mat once 
said "Go Away"). He was 79.  
</P>
<P>
 The freewheeling radio show host and game show panelist was one of the most 
biting, unpredictable characters to stomp across the nation's airwaves. 
</P>
<P>
 He insulted friends, sponsors, politicians and station owners, relying on an 
innate, instantaneous wit that required no scripts and few notes. 
</P>
<P>
 Morgan often said he prided himself on biting the hand that fed him. On many 
occasions, the hand was soon withdrawn, leading to a constant search for 
sponsors. 
</P>
<P>
 His signature sign-on of "Good evening, anybody. Here's Morgan," first 
attracted a radio following in the 1940s. It was initially a New York-based, 
15-minute program, then a half-hour radio network show. 
</P>
<P>
 Since his first experience with radio (as a pageboy in New York City in the 
early 1930s) he had been appalled by the serious demeanor of radio's early 
stars -- particularly the announcers who solemnly intoned commercial messages. 
</P>
<P>
 From that he developed routines that nearly always succeeded in tormenting his 
employers. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the more memorable sponsor-baiting moments of "The Henry Morgan Show" 
was a "shave-a-thon," in which contestants supposedly demonstrated that his 
sponsor's razor shaved more quickly than those of the competition. 
</P>
<P>
 Then he would recite horror stories of death and maiming suffered by shavers 
trying to do something absurd with the time they had saved shaving. 
</P>
<P>
 Morgan baited the pharmaceutical industry when he talked about the town of 
More, Utah. He said it had two doctors and "this led to the famous ad which 
begins, 'More doctors recommend. . . .' " 
</P>
<P>
 And the makers of Oh! Henry candy bars withdrew their support after he said 
the candy was a meal in itself, "but you eat three meals of O'Henry's and your 
teeth will fall out." 
</P>
<P>
 Once in 1947, he asked parents to leave the room, then advised children to run 
away from home and become smugglers. "It's exciting, it's healthy, it's a 
wonderful life," he told them. "Get out now before it's too late." 
</P>
<P>
 But he somehow enjoyed a long run with Adler Elevator Shoes, whose owner, 
derided on the air as "Old Man Adler," didn't mind the barbs. 
</P>
<P>
 This was unlike the evening he decided to mock the hole in the middle of 
Lifesavers. He accused the candy maker of cheating the public by selling them 
an empty space and offered to market the holes as "Morgan's Mint Middles." 
</P>
<P>
 Lifesavers canceled the show hours after Morgan left the air. 
</P>
<P>
 While Arthur Godfrey and Fred Allen occasionally tickled the mighty with a 
sardonic feather, Morgan wielded a club. 
</P>
<P>
 But his impudent style -- which attracted legions of loyal followers -- also 
was resented by many. They concluded that anyone that iconoclastic must be a 
Communist, and he found his name included in Red Channels, a listing of 
entertainers accused of Communist ties. He insisted he was apolitical but was 
blacklisted anyway. By refusing to quietly disappear from public view -- as had 
many others similarly accused -- he was able to keep his name before the public 
and eventually returned to regular TV appearances. 
</P>
<P>
 He was seen occasionally on the urbane panel show "What's My Line" and 
regularly on "I've Got a Secret," both enduring series of the 1950s and '60s. 
His lines there, however, were carefully monitored. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1951 he tried "Henry Morgan's Great Talent Hunt," a takeoff on amateur 
talent contests. It featured violinists who plucked the strings with their 
teeth, people who taught their dogs to "talk" or dancers who played various 
instruments while they were jumping about. It lasted five months. 
</P>
<P>
 In lieu of a funeral service, his friends are planning a cocktail party next 
month at Sardi's restaurant.

THE REV. DWIGHT RAMAGE; MINISTER FOUGHT SEGREGATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Rev. Dwight C. Ramage, 88, a Presbyterian minister and human relations 
pioneer who helped bring together segregated communities throughout Los Angeles 
County. Born in Adena, Ohio, Ramage was educated at Wooster College in Ohio and 
McCormick Theological Seminary in Chicago.After ministries in Montana and 
Washington state, he became youth director for the Seattle Council of Churches, 
and in the early 1940s worked with migrant workers in the Imperial and 
Coachella valleys. Eventually, Ramage settled his family in the San Gabriel 
Valley and began working for the Los Angeles County Probation Department. His 
efforts with young people in El Monte's "Hicks Camp" Latino neighborhood helped 
integrate El Monte schools in 1952. Under what became the county Human 
Relations Commission, Ramage worked to bring together various racial and ethnic 
groups in a "town meeting" atmosphere to help dispel fear and prejudice. He 
helped develop citizen councils in about 70 communities and foster integrated 
facilities such as parks and community centers. Interrupting his work for a 
month in 1965, Ramage lived in an African American family's home in Greenville, 
Miss., and worked for civil rights there. Ramage also helped create and chaired 
the United Nations Assn. of Southern California to promote international human 
relations. On May 3 in Arcadia.

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS; WOO SUES TO KEEP HIS NAME ON MAILER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL JACOBS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Taking a slap at Assembly Speaker Willie Brown and Democratic gubernatorial 
candidate Kathleen Brown, secretary of state candidate Michael Woo went to 
court Friday in an effort to keep his name on a "slate mailer" endorsement card 
aimed at more than 1 million California Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
 The immediate target of the lawsuit is Clint Reilly, Kathleen Brown's campaign 
manager, who also operates a prominent, for-profit slate mailer called the 
California Democratic Voter Checklist. 
</P>
<P>
 The breach of contract suit, filed in San Francisco Superior Court, charges 
that Reilly succumbed to pressure from the powerful Democratic Speaker and 
dropped Woo from his slate, substituting rival candidate Assemblywoman Gwen 
Moore, an ally of the Speaker. 
</P>
<P>
 Woo failed to obtain a court order Friday to force Reilly to include an 
endorsement of Woo in his mailers, but the suit, which also asks for monetary 
damages, will continue, his attorneys said. 
</P>
<P>
 In response to the suit, Reilly's attorneys argued that "Michael Woo asks this 
court for an order requiring defendants to lie to the public. . . . (Reilly) 
doesn't think Michael Woo is the best person for the job. He wants to endorse 
Gwen Moore, a highly qualified black woman, for secretary of state." 
</P>
<P>
 In a sworn statement, Reilly stated that his decision to support Moore "is a 
political one, not a commercial one," adding that he is losing money by making 
the switch. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this month, the Speaker acknowledged to reporters that he telephoned 
Kathleen Brown about his unhappiness over Reilly's initial decision to carry 
Woo and not Moore. The Speaker said he told her that Reilly's persistence in 
his private business "would be terribly counterproductive ultimately for her 
(Kathleen Brown)."  
</P>
<P>
 The Speaker said that Brown "informed me that that was a separate and distinct 
business, that she would speak to Mr. Reilly, though, and convey my views." 
</P>
<P>
 The Kathleen Brown campaign did not respond to questions about her role in the 
dispute. 
</P>
<P>
 Commercial slate mailers such as Reilly's do not reflect party endorsements. 
Candidates pay to get on them as a way of reaching large numbers of voters, 
often alongside the names of better known candidates running for the major 
offices, such as governor and U.S. senator. 
</P>
<P>
 Woo argued in his lawsuit that he had an oral contract with Reilly. In a sworn 
statement, Woo's campaign manager, Steve Glazer, described negotiating with 
Reilly for a slot on the mailers -- agreeing to pay $90,000 for the 
"endorsement." 
</P>
<P>
 Later, Glazer said, Reilly called to say "that he was getting enormous 
pressure from Speaker Willie Brown to replace Mike Woo with Gwen Moore on the 
slate card." Still later, Reilly told Glazer that he would be replacing Woo 
with Moore on the candidate slate and returned an initial payment of $60,000 to 
the Woo campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Woo contended that like other candidates in the secondary statewide races, he 
has counted on slate mailers like those sold by Reilly to reach voters and that 
he would be "severely damaged if I am . . . not included."

AL MARTINEZ: HARRY AT YOUR HEAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AL MARTINEZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Before there were electric clippers, there was Harry. 
</P>
<P>
 Before there was styling gel, there was Harry. Before there was mousse, hair 
spray, Vidal Sassoon or $200 trims, there was Harry. 
</P>
<P>
 There has, it seems, always been Harry. 
</P>
<P>
 That would be Harry Gelbart, who has been cutting hair, man and boy, for 
longer than most people do anything. And at 88, he is still cutting hair in a 
age when stylists, not cutters, abound. 
</P>
<P>
 By his own estimate, Harry has given 300,000 haircuts over the past 75 years. 
In his swift and capable hands have been entrusted the heads of everyone from 
John Kennedy to Bennie (never call him Bugsy) Siegel. 
</P>
<P>
 And on a recent Tuesday afternoon full of sunlight and soft breezes, I gave my 
own old gray head to Harry. Just a little off the sides, not too much off the 
top. 
</P>
<P>
 Harry is tucked away in the corner of a Beverly Hills bank building in a shop 
called Little Joe's. I sought him out because someone said to me he is probably 
the oldest barber in the world, and because I weary of an age that guns down 
the young and terrifies the old. 
</P>
<P>
 I needed someone gentle to talk to, a moment away from a city full of people 
afraid to walk after dark. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Harry is a tidy little man with a small mustache and curly gray hair who could 
pass as a character actor in one of his son's movies. 
</P>
<P>
 The son is Larry Gelbart of "M.A.S.H." and "City of Angels" fame, and so many 
other good things it would be inappropriate to list in a column about his pop. 
</P>
<P>
 I am certain, however, Larry would agree that cutting hair is at least as much 
of an art form as writing. 
</P>
<P>
 In writing, for example, it is not necessary to know the shape of a person's 
head or to cover bald spots or to give a haircut that doesn't look like a 
haircut.  
</P>
<P>
 To see Harry work is to witness the artistry of a man who deals in the most 
fragile of all human elements, a person's looks. 
</P>
<P>
 I watched his hands move like butterflies over one head and then felt them on 
my own, with the clipping of his scissors keeping time to a rhythm Harry has 
perfected over a lifetime. 
</P>
<P>
 That is not to say I am ready to abandon my own haircutter, who is Bobby 
Wallis of Woodland Hills. There is a relationship between a man and his barber 
closer than that of a mother and her baby. I would give up my cardiologist 
before I would give up my barber. 
</P>
<P>
 But to experience Harry is to experience a past so gentle it evokes memories 
of boyhood and balloons. Even Harry's jokes are old. Like the dog with no legs 
whose owner never gave him a name. "Why give him a name," he says, "when you 
call him he's not going to come anyhow." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Harry began as an apprentice barber at the age of 13, when a lot of kids today 
are occupied with sneaking 9-millimeter Lugers into school. He cut his daddy's 
hair first, and went on from there to a mountain of hair falling around his 
feet. 
</P>
<P>
 "I only take what's mine," Harry says, clipping away. 
</P>
<P>
 He has cut the hair of more celebrities than he cares to list and once 
declined an invitation to be President Kennedy's personal barber because he 
didn't want to leave Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Harry told the virtuoso violinist Jascha Heifetz, a good customer, that with 
his hands he'd have made a great barber, and convinced Siegel he should not 
throw a man through a plate-glass window just because he called him Bugsy. 
</P>
<P>
 I asked Harry, who looks no older than 61 and who has had a double bypass, how 
he manages to stay fit. "I keep breathing," he said, trimming my sideburns. 
</P>
<P>
 Then he explained that he walks three miles every day and has a shot of vodka 
before every meal. It has carried him through 51 years of one marriage and 16 
years into another. 
</P>
<P>
 "Today's hairstyles are crazy," Harry said when I asked if he tried to keep 
up. "I don't do those. I give haircuts." 
</P>
<P>
 Then he imparted the joke about the guy who is told by a shoe repairman it 
would take a week to fix his shoes. "Your sign says 'Shoes repaired while you 
wait,' " the customer complains. The repairman shrugs and says, "If you wanna 
wait, wait." 
</P>
<P>
 Harry smiled, finished up and handed me a mirror to view his work. It was very 
perfect.

YIELDING THE FLOOR TO 'THE LOYAL OPPOSITION' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * I'd like to thank The Times for publishing reader observations about 
Republicans who are frustrated by the abusive and dictatorial conduct of the 
liberal Democrat leadership in Congress (Letters, May 1). 
</P>
<P>
 While some of the sarcasm was clever, the crackdown by liberal Democrats on 
openness and debate is a serious threat to the democratic process, and it 
impacts every American. For example, during the current Congress, 79% of all 
bills have been restricted by Democrat-ordered rules that severely restrict 
debate and amendments. 
</P>
<P>
 That means that during consideration of President Clinton's massive tax 
increase, significant Republican amendments to cut spending and reduce taxes 
were prohibited. Because there was no debate, liberal big spenders were 
protected from having to cast recorded votes on many important and worthy 
proposals. This also happened during consideration of the recent crime bill. 
Most of the very best, tough-on-crime Republican proposals were blocked from 
consideration on the House floor. 
</P>
<P>
 Republicans can achieve legislative victories, such as the recent passage of 
Police Corps legislation, which I first introduced in 1989, and passage of my 
death penalty legislation for treason in cases in which people die. But to do 
so requires overcoming significant obstacles, many erected by tyrannical, 
liberal Democrat policy. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the U.S. Senate, the House is supposed to operate on the basis that the 
majority always wins. However, that is only on paper. With the extraordinary 
power granted to committee chairmen who decide what bills will be considered in 
their committees and the Rules Committee (stacked 9 to 4 in favor of 
Democrats), which decides what will be considered on the floor in debate, the 
legislation supported by the majority is easily derailed by a handful of 
congressmen. This is a powerful argument for term limits. 
</P>
<P>
 Should anti-tax, pro-defense conservatives like me join the Democratic Party, 
a bizarre suggestion made by one of your readers? Of course not. The 
frustration level for conservatives in the Democratic Party, who are trying to 
cut taxes and reduce spending, is equally high. Just ask Rep. Timothy J. Penny 
(D-Minn.) and other conservative Democrats whose beliefs and values are out of 
sync with the liberal Democratic leadership. Penny is quitting. 
</P>
<P>
 No one who runs for Congress ever expects to be in the minority forever. But 
when you have accomplished as much as I have fighting taxes, savage defense 
cuts and runaway government regulation, then it's easy to say, as I do: I'm 
proud to be a member of the loyal opposition. 
</P>
<P>
 REP. ROBERT K. DORNAN 
</P>
<P>
 (R-Garden Grove) 
</P>
<P>
 * Just to set the record straight: At no time did I indicate that I was 
disillusioned or frustrated with my role as a Republican in a 
Democrat-controlled Congress (Letters, May 1). Democrats now have control of 
both houses of Congress, as well as the executive branch. They've used their 
power to raise taxes, enact costly regulation and pass a crime bill that guts 
the death penalty. It's exciting to see the Democrats finally unmasking 
themselves with every new extreme, leftist policy and appointment announced by 
the Administration. Not only am I not frustrated, I am excited about being a 
stalwart and offering a positive conservative alternative to the current 
liberal nonsense. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, I couldn't help but notice a letter you printed claiming I'd limited a 
constituent's right to question my votes at a town hall meeting. My town hall 
meetings have been open, and no question or short statement has ever been ruled 
out. The case mentioned was a Democrat who wanted to give a speech and a 
rebuttal to every answer at a town hall meeting. Courtesy dictates that time at 
town hall meetings be dedicated to public questions so people will have the 
chance to hear their elected representatives. This person's insistence on using 
limited time to give a speech about her concerns was a bit arrogant.

DOMES DAY FOR TEXAS, BOSTON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Less than six weeks after Boston scored 22 runs in a drubbing of Kansas City, 
the Red Sox learned how it feels. 
</P>
<P>
 A few states away, also under the cover of a dome, the Texas Rangers could 
commiserate. 
</P>
<P>
 It feels pretty bad, actually. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody got hurt, so that's one good thing," Boston Manager Butch Hobson said 
Friday at the Metrodome in Minneapolis after the Minnesota Twins got 22 hits, 
including a club-record eight in a row in an 11-run fifth inning, and beat the 
Red Sox, 21-2. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were hitting everything we threw up there," Hobson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Texas Manager Kevin Kennedy had to feel pretty much the same after the Rangers 
were blasted, 19-2, by the Seattle Mariners, who got 20 hits in the Kingdome. 
</P>
<P>
 At Minneapolis, there were plenty of heroes for the Twins. As usual, Kirby 
Puckett was among them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel like every time I go up to the plate I'm going to get a hit," said 
Puckett, who had three of them and a career-high seven RBIs to help the Twins 
win their sixth in a row. "I feel if I get a good pitch, I'm going to get a 
hit. But I'm just the same old Kirby." 
</P>
<P>
 Not quite. The same old Kirby was 0 for 16 against Boston reliever Todd 
Frohwirth. Puckett, who has seven hits in his last eight at-bats, hit a 
three-run homer against Frohwirth to spark the Twins' barrage in the fifth 
inning. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't believe I finally got a hit off him," said Puckett, whose seven RBIs 
were the most for the Twins since Randy Bush had eight against Texas in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Minnesota also set club records for RBIs (21) and largest winning margin and 
tied a record by sending 16 men to the plate in the fifth. 
</P>
<P>
 Carlos Pulido (2-3) made a last-minute start in place of Scott Erickson. 
</P>
<P>
 The offensive outburst was just what Pulido (2-3) needed. He allowed three 
hits and one run in seven innings. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pulido did a real nice job," Twin Manager Tom Kelly said in understatement. 
"He got a lead and won himself a ballgame in an emergency situation." 
</P>
<P>
 The Twins raked five Boston pitchers, and the most effective Boston pitcher 
was the sixth, reserve outfielder Andy Tomberlin, who held Minnesota to no runs 
and one hit in the seventh and eighth innings. 
</P>
<P>
 In Seattle, Edgar Martinez hit one of the Mariners' five homers and had a 
career-high five RBIs as they set a team record for runs. 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez capped Seattle's record outburst with a two-run homer in the seventh 
inning. He also had an RBI single in the first and a two-run double in the 
fourth. 
</P>
<P>
 Ken Griffey Jr. hit his major league leading 18th homer, a two-run shot in the 
first inning, to start the rout. The homer was Griffey's 11th this month and 
the 150th of his career. Griffey has homered in six of the last nine games. 
</P>
<P>
 Tino Martinez added a two-run shot for Seattle, Reggie Jefferson had a 
three-run homer and Torey Lovullo hit one with the bases empty. 
</P>
<P>
 Randy Johnson (4-3) allowed five hits and two runs in six innings to earn the 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Roger Pavlik (0-2), who was making his second start of the season, allowed 
eight hits, including three homers, and nine runs in 1 2/3 innings.

EDMONDS FUELS ANGELS IN NINTH; BASEBALL: HIS TWO-OUT SINGLE DRIVES IN REYNOLDS 
FOR A 7-6 VICTORY OVER THE ROYALS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLIOTT TEAFORD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Angel first baseman Jim Edmonds stood at home plate with pinch-runner Harold 
Reynolds on second base and two out in the bottom of the ninth with the score 
6-6 Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Kansas City reliever Mike Magnante delivered and so did Edmonds, sending a 
single into left field to score Reynolds for the winning run in a 7-6 Angel 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Score another one for Marcel Lachemann, who is 2-0 as the Angels' new manager. 
Lachemann had inserted Edmonds as a pinch-hitter for Eduardo Perez, who was 
hitless in three at-bats, in the seventh. 
</P>
<P>
 In the fourth inning, Angel starter Joe Magrane stood, hands on hips, staring 
down in disgust. 
</P>
<P>
 Only moments before, Magrane had given up his second home run of the game and 
Lachemann walked to the mound to replace him with reliever Mark Leiter. 
</P>
<P>
 Angel management muzzled Buck Rodgers by firing him as manager Tuesday, but 
performances such as Magrane's keep reminding fans that the club is trying to 
win with three pitchers nobody else wanted. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday night's crowd of 23,339 saw why Magrane is no longer pitching for the 
St. Louis Cardinals. Leiter and John Dopson also were cut by their previous 
employers. 
</P>
<P>
 Dopson did not pitch Friday, but Leiter kept the Royals scoreless with only 
one hit and one walk through 5 1/3 innings of solid relief. Leiter made his 
second relief appearance since Rodgers moved him to the bullpen Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 He retired 17 of 18 he faced and had four strikeouts entering the ninth. He 
also gave the Angels a shot at winning after they trailed, 6-3, in the fourth. 
</P>
<P>
 Kansas City starter Jeff Granger failed to last past the fifth, giving up solo 
homers by Rex Hudler and Bo Jackson. Jackson's blast, which brought the Angels 
to within 6-5 in the fifth inning, was estimated at 460 feet, landing about 25 
rows deep into the football bleachers beyond the left-center field wall. 
</P>
<P>
 Hudler, batting leadoff, helped put Granger in trouble, doubling into the left 
field corner in each of his first two at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
 In the fourth, he slammed a 3-and-2 pitch from Granger over the left field 
fence. It was his sixth hit in as many at-bats, which included four doubles and 
one homer. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels made the score 6-6 in the sixth when Chili Davis grounded into a 
fielder's choice against reliever Hipolito Pichardo, scoring Chad Curtis from 
third. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday, Magrane pitched into the fifth inning before the Seattle Mariners 
finished him off, battering him for five runs and eight hits with five walks in 
4 1/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
 That's when Rodgers sounded off, wondering if it was asking too much to win 
with three pitchers who have been released by other clubs. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday, Magrane lasted only until the fourth, giving up six runs and six hits 
with two walks, a hit batter and a wild pitch in 3 2/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
 In 19 innings over four starts since returning from elbow surgery, Magrane has 
given up 24 hits, including six home runs, and 18 earned runs. His earned-run 
average is 8.53. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, even after another rocky outing, Magrane's status will remain the same. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the first time I've ever seen him throw," Lachemann said. "We missed him 
last year with the Cardinals. The solo home runs aren't going to beat you." 
</P>
<P>
 The last time Granger took the field at Anaheim Stadium, he wore a helmet and 
shoulder pads as Texas A&M's starting quarterback in the Disneyland Pigskin 
Classic on Aug. 26, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 But Granger's football career quickly fizzled and he proved to be far more 
accomplished as a pitcher. The No. 5 player picked in last year's draft, 
Granger went into Friday looking for his first major league victory. He lost to 
the Oakland Athletics on Sunday in his first major league start, giving up 
three runs and seven hits in 5 1/3 innings of the Royals' 6-2 loss.

THIS BULL RUN TRAMPLES KNICKS; NBA PLAYOFFS: CHICAGO ATTACKS EARLY AND OFTEN IN 
93-79 VICTORY TO SET UP GAME 7. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 They spent years going for the kill, especially at the old-home arena ticketed 
for the wrecking ball, but here were the champions in an unusual predicament 
Friday night, suddenly aiming simply for survival. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chicago Bulls hadn't faced this situation in two years, since the same 
Eastern Conference semifinals against the same New York Knicks in 1992. When 
the latest test came, in what could have been their final game at Chicago 
Stadium before moving across the street to a new building next season, the 
emotion and the response matched the urgency of the moment. 
</P>
<P>
 Bulls 93, Knicks 79. As if they were worried. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an experienced, veteran team with three championships," said Chicago 
backup guard Steve Kerr, looking for his first. "They don't let things like 
that bother them." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the Bulls did much more than scratch and claw to survive and set up a 
deciding Game 7 on Sunday afternoon at Madison Square Garden for a trip to the 
conference finals. They raced to a 15-point lead barely 11 minutes into the 
game, pushed it to 19 in the second quarter and dug in for the tough stretch, 
when the Knicks got within eight late in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 That challenge was turned away. Then, when New York made another 
fourth-quarter charge, and the noose seemed to be tightening on the Bulls in a 
scene reminiscent of their collapses in Games 1 and 2, the answer came loud and 
clear again. The nine-point advantage with 7:51 left went back to 15 within 
about 3 1/2 minutes, and the Knicks went away for good. 
</P>
<P>
 The moment that said it all? 
</P>
<P>
 Scottie Pippen hammered a right-handed dunk in the face of Patrick Ewing 
midway through the third period, giving him a quick shove while descending to 
send him to the ground and stood over the fallen Knick center under the basket 
taunting him. 
</P>
<P>
 "It started bad for us and continued to be that way the rest of the game," New 
York Coach Pat Riley said. "It's a very simple situation now for both teams. It 
comes down to one game, set, series. . . . The quicker we can leave this one 
behind and gather our forces for Sunday, the better off we'll be." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Bull guard John Paxson: "I think we came out and responded great tonight. 
The start we had was indicative of how we wanted to play this whole series. And 
now we have to carry that type of beginning into Sunday's game." 
</P>
<P>
 Even the return of Derek Harper made little difference for the Knicks. Back 
after a two-game suspension for fighting with Jo Jo English, he came off the 
bench for the first time in his eight playoff appearances but quickly inherited 
a prominent role when Greg Anthony proved ineffective (three points, one 
assist, four turnovers in 15 minutes). 
</P>
<P>
 Harper played 31 minutes, getting booed each time he checked in and almost 
every time he touched the ball and jeered every time he committed a foul or 
mistake. The result was 11 points, three assists and three turnovers on a night 
when nothing seemed to get the New York offense going, a notion most evident in 
their 37.3% shooting from the field. Take away the game-high 26 points from 
Ewing on nine-of-18 shooting and the 18 from John Starks while going six of 12, 
and the 10 other Knicks combined for 35 points and 28.9% shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bulls weren't much better -- 39.8% -- but they were good enough with B.J. 
Armstrong scoring 20 points and Horace Grant adding 16 points and 12 rebounds 
to lead their domination on the boards. Now to carry over the effort, to a time 
when, unlike Friday, both sides will be trying to survive. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a game that will be played with a lot of energy and force," Riley said. 
"Let's get to Sunday."

ONE GETS AWAY FROM CANDIOTTI, GOTT AND DODGERS; BASEBALL: WALTON'S HIT DRIVES 
IN FERNANDEZ WITH NINTH-INNING RUN AS CINCINNATI WINS, 3-2. 
</P>

<P>
 The ball flew over Cory Snyder's head on its way to the wall in left field, 
and Snyder simply stood there. All he could do was tilt his head up, say goodby 
to the game, and along with the rest of his teammates, walk slowly into the 
dugout at Riverfront Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dodgers lost, 3-2, to the Cincinnati Reds on Friday night when Jerome 
Walton, an outfielder with 15 at-bats this season, drove a Jim Gott fastball. 
It was Walton's first run batted in, but it wasn't exactly his line drive that 
cost the Dodgers only their second loss in the last 11 games. 
</P>
<P>
 The game was lost earlier in the inning when Gott, who relieved Tom Candiotti 
to pitch the ninth inning, gave up a leadoff single to Tony Fernandez, who went 
to second on a sacrifice bunt by Bret Boone and to third when Gott bounced a 
wild pitch in the dirt. With only one out, just about anything could have 
scored Fernandez. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've had great success pitching against (Fernandez)," Gott (5-2) said. "I've 
always struck him out on a curveball or slider on the outside part of the 
plate. But he hit me tonight, and he's the first guy up. I can't let him on." 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Piazza, scheduled for a rare night off, was hoping for a blowout of some 
sort so he wouldn't be pressed into duty as a pinch-hitter. But he said that, 
about the third inning, with Candiotti and Red starter Jose Rijo throwing well, 
he had a feeling the respite wouldn't last. He went into the clubhouse, had 
trainer Charlie Strasser stretch his legs and was at the plate in the ninth 
inning, hitting for Candiotti, who left with the score tied, 2-2. 
</P>
<P>
 Piazza faced right-hander Johnny Ruffin (3-0), who, along with left-hander Tim 
Fortugno, had combined to hold the Dodgers hitless since Rijo departed after 
the sixth inning. Jose Offerman, who had drawn a one-out walk, was on second 
after a stolen base. Piazza flied out. 
</P>
<P>
 Brett Butler walked before Delino DeShields hit a line drive to right fielder 
Reggie Sanders, who, until then, had been shading DeShields toward center 
field. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought that was the hit that killed us," Manager Tom Lasorda said. "I 
thought it was a cinch hit when it came off his bat, and I said, 'Where the 
hell is (Sanders) playing him?' " 
</P>
<P>
 For two teams leading the league in offense, runs were few and far between. 
The Dodgers scored two in the second inning and held a 2-1 lead into the 
seventh, when pinch-runner Walton, running for Brian Dorsett, who had walked 
with two out, scored on a single by Barry Larkin. 
</P>
<P>
 Jose Rijo was trying for his 100th victory, but after 122 pitches through six 
innings he called it a day. He left after pitching out of jams in every inning 
but the first. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dodgers had left four runners in scoring position. 
</P>
<P>
 "He uses all of his stuff and always keeps his team in the game," said Tim 
Wallach, who doubled and scored in the second inning on a groundout by Raul 
Mondesi. 
</P>
<P>
 Rijo was tough, but the Reds' bullpen was tougher. In the last 13 games, the 
bullpen has an 0.92 earned-run average, having given up only four earned runs 
in 39 2/3 innings. Seven Dodgers were retired in order until Ruffin, who had 
started the eighth inning, walked Offerman in the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
 In the bottom of the ninth, Piazza was catching, having replaced Carlos 
Hernandez, and had a good view of the Reds. 
</P>
<P>
 Fernandez was on first. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were pitching (Boone) inside, so if he tried to bunt, it would pop him up. 
We were throwing right at him," Piazza said. "I didn't expect him to bunt it 
that well, and he laid it down perfectly down the first base line and we have a 
guy on second with only one out." 
</P>
<P>
 Boone's thoughts were about the same as Piazza's. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know that if I don't get the bunt down, we are in extra innings," Boone 
said. "Even if Kevin Mitchell is at bat, you've got to bunt." 
</P>
<P>
 Then, Gott threw Walton a curveball in the dirt that Piazza tried to block, 
but to no avail. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't second-guess it. I make a living throwing a ball in the dirt," Gott 
said. "It just got away." 
</P>
<P>
 So did the game, when Walton hit a ball over Snyder's head.

ADELMAN NEVER HAD FELT A SENSE OF LOSS LIKE THIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rick Adelman is leaving the Portland Trail Blazers with no hard feelings and 
he hopes fans remember the good times that his best teams brought to the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Less than 24 hours after being fired, Adelman met with the media Friday at 
Memorial Coliseum and spoke at length about his 11 years with the Blazers, the 
last 5 1/2 of them as head coach. 
</P>
<P>
 He admitted that it felt strange to walk into the building knowing he no 
longer was the coach. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's more of a sense of loss because it's been so special here," he said. 
"You think back to the fans, when we were on a roll and everything else was 
going on. It's been a special five or six years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think my wife Mary Kay said it best. She woke up this morning and felt like 
we'd just lost in the finals. That's how it feels." 
</P>
<P>
 Adelman knows that feeling well. Twice his Blazers made it to the Finals, 
before losing to Detroit in 1990 and Chicago in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 But there is no regret that he never made it to the top, he said. As he 
watches this year's playoffs, he said, he realizes the greatness of the 
accomplishments of those earlier Blazers' teams. 
</P>
<P>
 "One team is going to come out a winner and I guess everybody else loses," he 
said. "But I don't look at it that way, because I had the good fortune to be 
around a lot of winners in the last five years, and that's the way I'm going to 
look at it." 
</P>
<P>
 Adelman will receive about $1.5 million for the remaining time on his 
contract. He is uncertain whether he would return to coaching. 
</P>
<P>
 "If a job opens up and somebody is interested in me, I'd talk to them," he 
said. "But I'm not actively going out and looking for anything right now. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes you need to step away and see what you want to do with your life." 
</P>
<P>
 He said he eventually might return to the Blazers in a front office job. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would be very open to coming back in the organization in some capacity in 
the future maybe," he said. "But I think right now it's best maybe that there 
is a change." 
</P>
<P>
 Adelman said he wanted to be a part of owner Paul Allen's rebuilding plans as 
coach and felt he could do the job. But he said he understood why Allen felt 
otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are no sour grapes," Adelman said. "We're leaving on very good terms 
... I understand what he's doing. I just hope it works out for him, the 
players, the organization and the fans of Portland." 
</P>
<P>
 He admitted that this season, when the Blazers were an inconsistent 47-35 and 
were knocked out of the playoffs by Houston in the first round, was 
frustrating. 
</P>
<P>
 "Realistically, when you look at our team last year and you look at the 
results, yeah, the expectations were way out of line," he said. "We were not a 
championship caliber team. We didn't play like it, and I take responsibility 
for that to an extent." 
</P>
<P>
 He rejected the often-heard criticism that he was unable to motivate his 
players and that he didn't use his younger players enough. 
</P>
<P>
 "It gets down to a lot of personalities going for the same thing, the same 
goal," he said. "If some people don't have that in mind, you can be the 
greatest motivational speaker in the world and it isn't going to work. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never thought I lost the ability to communicate anything. Apparently people 
perceive that you lose the ability to coach in two years. I don't think that 
happens." 
</P>
<P>
 The younger players didn't play more, he said, because they weren't as good as 
those who did play. 
</P>
<P>
 Adelman won 64 percent of his games, counting the playoffs, and never had a 
losing record in his five full seasons as coach. He said he won't miss the 
second-guessing and criticism, and he hopes people remember what a team the 
Blazers had. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hopefully, what they're going to realize, and it has nothing to do with me, 
is they had a special team here ... that gave people an awful lot of 
excitement," he said.

RUELAS STOPS ALEXANDER IN SEVENTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM KAWAKAMI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gabriel Ruelas, tuning up for a title shot in the near future, was too strong 
and too quick for Paris Alexander, who was sent to the canvas four times over 
six-plus rounds. 
</P>
<P>
 After knocking Alexander down three times before the seventh, Ruelas opened 
the round with a left that caught Alexander on the chin. Alexander, who was 
knocked down twice in the sixth, collapsed backward to the canvas, and his 
corner immediately threw in the towel. 
</P>
<P>
 The official time of the technical knockout was 14 seconds of the seventh 
before 2,214 at the Olympic Auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't think I was hitting him that hard," Ruelas said. "Maybe I was, but 
he was just moving so much. I've never fought anybody who was running like 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 Ruelas (38-2, 21 knockouts), the No. 1 contender in the World Boxing Council 
junior-lightweight rankings, is due for a mandatory challenge against new 
champion James Leija within 90 days. 
</P>
<P>
 The only difficult moment for Ruelas, who was knocked down by Raul Hernandez 
in his last bout, was when Alexander caught him with a quick right to the 
forehead in the final seconds of the first round, wobbling Ruelas against the 
lower ropes as the bell sounded. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruelas answered in the second and third, controlling Alexander (16-9-3), who 
was dominated by Oscar De La Hoya last year. Ruelas also scored a knockdown in 
the fourth. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 10-round co-feature, Long Beach heavyweight Jeremy Williams, who 
suffered his first professional loss last March to Larry Donald, knocked out 
Andrew Stokes at 39 seconds of the first round. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams (16-1, 12 KOs) and Stokes exchanged light punches in the middle of 
the ring for a few seconds after the opening bell, then Williams leaned in and 
connected with a short right to the side of Stokes' head that dropped Stokes 
(14-12-1) head-first to the floor, where he stayed for the 10 count. 
</P>
<P>
 "Joe (Goossen, Williams' new trainer) told me to take my time and show the 
public that the Larry Donald stuff was not me," Williams said.

RULE BRITANNIA, THE HEAVYWEIGHT DIVISION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I'm sure Lennox Lewis' opponents would beg to differ about whether or not he 
can fight. 
</P>
<P>
 It appears to me that it's sour grapes on Jim Murray's part when he writes 
that Lewis is a one-dimensional fighter. There are about five heavyweights in 
England who are superior to anything we have to offer in this country. Apart 
from Mike Tyson, there isn't a heavy worth his weight who is in the class of 
Hide, Bruno, Mason, Akewande or Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
 Time will tell, and I hope that Murray can face the prospect that this country 
no longer rules the heavyweight division.

STANLEY CUP PLAYOFFS / WESTERN CONFERENCE FINALS; CANUCKS KEEP MOMENTUM GOING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Vancouver Canucks had been doing pretty well on the road in the Stanley 
Cup playoffs. They were still glad to play at home for the first time in 10 
days, and it showed. 
</P>
<P>
 The Canucks gained the upper hand in the Western Conference finals with a 4-0 
victory over the Toronto Maple Leafs on Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Pavel Bure, known as the "Russian Rocket," scored twice for the Canucks, who 
took a 2-1 lead in the best-of-seven series with the next two games in 
Vancouver on Sunday and Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Vancouver goalkeeper Kirk McLean stopped 29 shots for his third shutout of the 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 "The win's the important thing," McLean said. "The shutout's the bonus." 
</P>
<P>
 Greg Adams scored in the second period and Martin Gelinas scored the last 
Vancouver goal in the game's final minute when Toronto was two men short. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kirk was the difference," Canuck Coach Pat Quinn said. "We weren't as good as 
I would have liked us to have been. We weren't sharp. We were lucky in a lot of 
cases tonight, and Kirk was really good." 
</P>
<P>
 The victory was the fourth in seven playoff games for the Canucks, who are 6-2 
on the road after splitting two games at Toronto earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Vancouver has won nine of its last 11 games in getting within two victories of 
its first Stanley Cup final since 1982. 
</P>
<P>
 "Vancouver is playing well, so we have to play well the rest of the games," 
Toronto's Wendel Clark said. "We're not playing our game the way we can, but 
don't take anything away from a club that's playing well." 
</P>
<P>
 The game deteriorated into an ugly brawl at 16:50 of the third period after a 
check by Vancouver wing Tim Hunter on Doug Gilmour of the Maple Leafs. Several 
fights broke out and the altercation continued after Gilmour went after Cliff 
Ronning, the smallest Vancouver player. 
</P>
<P>
 Referee Andy van Hellemond sent both teams to the dressing room after fans 
littered the ice with debris, including boxing gloves and a dead fish. 
</P>
<P>
 Emotions spilled over into the press box when George McPhee, vice-president of 
hockey operations for the Canucks, smashed a window, cutting a statistician. 
</P>
<P>
 When the teams returned 10 minutes later, four players were ejected, including 
Gilmour. 
</P>
<P>
 Quinn said the brawl was "calculated by the Maple Leafs. They pulled that last 
series against San Jose." 
</P>
<P>
 Toronto outshot the Canucks, 15-9, in the opening period, getting most of the 
scoring chances during three power plays. Vancouver killed off a two-man 
disadvantage for 1:29. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a win and that's all that matters," Canuck defenseman Gerald Diduck 
said. "We didn't give them a lot of odd-man chances on the rush. That allows us 
to stand up at the blue line." 
</P>
<P>
 Bure opened the scoring with a spectacular effort at 13:25 of the first after 
a neutral-ice giveaway by defenseman Bob Rouse. 
</P>
<P>
 Bure scored on another breakaway in the third after Vancouver forward Murray 
Craven blocked a shot.

IT'S BUSINESS AS USUAL FOR ANGELS

 Well, you don't have to go to Rancho Cucamonga to check out a minor league

 Following Buck Rodgers with Bobby Knoop and Marcel Lachemann is like following 
Pavarotti with Tiny Tim, or Ronald Reagan with George Bush. It's like Smiley

 We haven't felt this bad about a managerial firing since the Angels canned

 Mike Downey almost had it right when he justly lambasted Bill Bavasi et al for 
the firing of Buck Rodgers. I am just a bit surprised, however, at his apparent 
astonishment regarding the Angel front office's lack of reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 When dealing with incredibly inflated egos, Mr. Downey should know better than 
to question the motives of self-styled gods. Did we question why Gene Autry saw 
it proper to congratulate himself (or was it Jackie?) by retiring a number in 
his name? I mean, his is only the last of the original expansion teams of its 
era never to have won or even appear in a World Series. 
</P>
<P>
 My advice to the team is to stop spending so much time and money trying to buy 
immortality and injured goods and appreciate the true quality, however rare, of 
some of the players and coaches like Rodgers, even if he does open his mouth 
too much.

 I don't understand the shock and surprise surrounding the recent firing of 
Buck Rodgers. Anyone familiar with the history of this organization knows there 
has always been a lack of respect and loyalty shown the fans, managers and 
select veteran players by the Angel hierarchy. 
</P>
<P>
 I would be interested in the computation of how much money could have been 
saved over the last 34 years had a couple of managers been given votes of 
confidence, rather than this embarrassing parade of hirings, contract 
extensions and firings. 
</P>
<P>
 I concur with Ross Newhan -- a winning management team will only be assembled 
when the cowboy and his cowgirl gallop -- not ride -- into the sunset.

BALTIMOREAN SAYS, KEEP YOUR RAMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The subject of the Rams and the rumor that the team might move to Baltimore is 
the reason for this letter. Simply put, the act of stealing another city's 
football team is a crime.All of Anaheim and Los Angeles should stand up and 
prevent this from happening. 
</P>
<P>
 You see, the good people of Baltimore are not represented by this shameful 
scheme of coaxing somebody else's team to move. Baltimore football fans were 
deeply saddened when this city was burglarized of its team, the Colts, 10 years 
ago. Now it is 1994, and the feeling among most fans is that we will not become 
thieves ourselves. 
</P>
<P>
 As for me and the thousands of football fans in Baltimore, we have been 
blessed with the arrival of the Canadian Football League and the team is called 
the Colts. After 10 years, pro football is reborn, not rented, stolen or 
borrowed. 
</P>

<P>
 I am a Ram season-ticket holder and lifelong fan. Yes, there are Ram fans out 
there, and a very loyal group of them occupies the north end of Anaheim 
Stadium. The Rams are wrong if they think there is no support in Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a tough market in which to prosper. Southern California will support the 
Rams and professional football if they can win and contend for the playoffs. 
Yes, a new city will be enthusiastic toward the Rams, but after a few years of 
losing, that will wear off and the Rams will play in an empty house once again. 
</P>
<P>
 Running away won't solve the Rams' problems. Put a consistent winner on the 
field. Victories make the price of a professional game worthwhile. Give the 
fans what they want: a winner.

INDY WITHOUT BIG AL? SAY IT AIN'T SO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Indianapolis 500 won't be the same, now that Al Unser has retired from the 
sport. 
</P>
<P>
 Big Al was the consummate pro when it came to Indy car racing.His four Indy 
500 victories and 11 top-three finishes are unmatched. 
</P>
<P>
 In an era of egotistical, spoiled, cry-baby athletes, Big Al quietly became 
the best Indy 500 driver of all time. 
</P>
<P>
 But most people are unaware of this. You see, Big Al was a boring story for 
the media. He was always a perfect gentleman, he never had a drug problem and 
there was never a trace of scandal near the man. In a society that seems to 
wonder where its idols have gone, it might be a good idea if we looked in front 
of our nose. You see, Big Al does prove that nice guys can finish first.

HE'S NOT A PROSPECT FOR WORLD CUP TICKETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 How much longer must we be subjected to all of this made-up hype over soccer? 
</P>
<P>
 With the exception of some immigrants and selected parents whose interest 
lasts only as long as their kids play, no one truly gives a hoot. 
</P>
<P>
 For 20 years, white middle class parents have pushed their kids through youth 
soccer, but no one is interested enough to buy tickets. 
</P>
<P>
 Stop trying to make Americans feel they should feel guilty about not liking 
this dull sport and understand that soccer will always be like softball in the 
U.S. -- everybody may play but few will pay.

<P>
 With the title match between a Pac-10 and Southeastern Conference player, the 
NCAA champion will come from one of those two conferences for the 13th 
consecutive year. The Pac-10 has won eight titles, the SEC four. 
</P>
<P>
 Phebus (32-7) carries a seven-match winning streak into the final. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people have doubted my ability and I always seem to be seeded 
lower," Phebus said. "This was more of a battle from within. I wanted this for 
myself. I didn't want to get too wrapped up in what everybody else has been 
expecting from me."

MAXWELL: HOUSTON WILL WIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS BAKER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Houston guard Vernon Maxwell guarantees that the Rockets will beat the Phoenix 
Suns in the seventh game of the NBA Western Conference semifinals today at the 
Summit. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're definitely going to win," Maxwell said shortly after being ejected in 
the fourth quarter of Thursday night's 103-89 loss at Phoenix."We're going to 
get ready to play whoever wins the game in Utah (today between the Jazz and the 
Denver Nuggets in the other Western Conference semifinal)." 
</P>
<P>
 Rocket center Hakeem Olajuwon isn't as confident that Houston will advance to 
the Western Conference finals for the third time in franchise history. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody can guarantee the future," Olajuwon said. "But we're in a very good 
position. We have to be smart, play with confidence and take care of business." 
</P>
<P>
 Maxwell will need to shoot better than he did Thursday for the Rockets to make 
good on his prediction. He had 34 points in Game 3, his best playoff game ever, 
but made only two of 10 shots and scored six points in Game 6. 
</P>
<P>
 Guard Kenny Smith didn't shoot much better, missing eight of 11 shots and 
scoring eight points. 
</P>
<P>
 Phoenix guard Kevin Johnson, who overcame a bad Game 5 by getting 28 points 
and 13 assists in Game 6, expects the Suns to advance. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're very confident. We've been in this situation many times," Johnson said. 
"We're looking forward to it. We're going to try to rediscover what we're made 
of."

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Utah Jazz were short-tempered and sullen after searching game tapes Friday 
for ways to avoid making NBA history in the worst possible fashion. 
</P>
<P>
 After losing three in a row to Denver, Utah could become the first team to 
lose a playoff series after leading 3-0. That isn't all that plagues the Jazz 
before today's Game 7. 
</P>
<P>
 Karl Malone, still stinging from Jazz owner Larry Miller's criticism of his 
performance, says he might leave the team. Miller also got into a scuffle with 
Denver fans at Tuesday's game. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller apologized for both incidents Thursday. But Malone said Friday that 
relations remained strained. 
</P>
<P>
 The Nuggets are trying to repeat their first-round rebound from an 0-2 deficit 
to oust Seattle.

 On the day after his first victory as the Angels' new manager, Marcel

 Lachemann said his conversation with Rodgers did not involve advice on 
individual players.

 "We had a nice little visit," Lachemann said. "Basically, he said he liked the

AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP; BLUE JAYS REACH .500, SNAP INDIANS' STREAK AT 8 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It has been a tough struggle for the Toronto Blue Jays merely to reach the 
.500 mark this season. Without Pat Hentgen and Joe Carter, it would be a lot 
tougher for the winners of the last two World Series. 
</P>
<P>
 Hentgen's pitching and Carter's hitting Friday night at Toronto enabled the 
Blue Jays to end Cleveland's eight-game winning streak, 2-0, and improve their 
record to 20-20. 
</P>
<P>
 Carter, who leads the majors in runs batted in with 51, drove in the two runs 
with his 13th home run after a two-out double by Paul Molitor in the first 
inning. 
</P>
<P>
 Hentgen (6-3) gave up only four hits, struck out eight and walked one in 
pitching his second shutout this month. He had to be sharp because the Indians' 
Charles Nagy (3-3) was brilliant after the first inning. He went the distance, 
striking out nine. 
</P>
<P>
 New York 5, Baltimore 1 -- On a night when many American League hitters were 
on a rampage, Jim Abbott turned in another sparkling pitching performance at 
New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Abbott (5-2) held the Orioles to six hits in seven-plus innings and enabled 
the Yankees to extend their lead in the East to 1 1/2 games over Boston. 
</P>
<P>
 Randy Velarde was the star as the Yankees scored all their runs in the fourth 
inning. Velarde hit his first home run of the season, a three-run blast. 
</P>
<P>
 The Yankees' Paul O'Neill walked twice and singled twice to raise his major 
league-leading average to an amazing .465. 
</P>
<P>
 Detroit 10, Milwaukee 4 -- Tony Phillips and Lou Whitaker put on a hitting 
clinic at Detroit to send the Brewers to their ninth defeat in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 The top two guys in the batting order delivered a one-two punch. Between them 
they had eight hits in nine at-bats, scored six runs and drove in five runs. 
</P>
<P>
 Phillips, the leadoff hitter, made the only out. But he had a double and his 
fifth home run, scored four runs and drove in two. 
</P>
<P>
 Whitaker hit his eighth home run and was four for four. 
</P>
<P>
 John Doherty (5-3) got the victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago 13, Oakland 6 -- Darrin Jackson had four hits, including his sixth 
home run, and drove in five runs to lead the White Sox rout of the Athletics.

BASEBALL / DAILY REPORT; DODGERS; FASHION STATEMENT IN VISITORS' CLUBHOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARYANN HUDSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dodger Manager Tom Lasorda couldn't decide who looked better in earrings -- 
Omar Daal or Raul Mondesi. What he did know is that his players were sitting 
around the visiting team clubhouse in Cincinnati before Friday's game wearing 
some of the worst-looking clip earrings you'll ever see. 
</P>
<P>
 "All I know is that when I came in, I heard someone say, 'Grab your earrings,' 
" said Tom Candiotti, who sat in his locker reading while wearing a dangling, 
beaded number. 
</P>
<P>
 Roger McDowell, with the financial assistance of Brett Butler, had spent $150 
on 25 pairs of earrings. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the players' way of spoofing Cincinnati Red owner Marge Schott's recent 
remark about men who wear earrings being "fruits." The original plan was to 
wear the earrings during the national anthem, but they did not. 
</P>
<P>
 Schott issued a written apology minutes after the game began. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am sorry if I offended anyone with a remark I made during a speech on 
Wednesday," she said in the statement. "I did not mean to say anything 
insensitive. What I was trying to say was that I am quite proud that our 
players have traditionally been clean shaven and earring-free while wearing a 
Cincinnati Reds uniform. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "Neither I, nor anyone in the Cincinnati Reds organization, is prejudiced 
against any group, regardless of lifestyle preference." 
</P>
<P>
 McDowell's shopping spree grew out of a comment announcer Rick Monday made to 
Butler after reading about Schott's remark: "If you guys had any guts, you 
would wear earrings in Cincinnati." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 The Reds recalled right-handed pitcher John Roper from their triple-A team and 
he will pitch today against Ramon Martinez. Tim Pugh, originally scheduled to 
pitch today, will pitch Sunday. MARYANN HUDSON

RANGERS-DEVILS: IT'S MORE THAN A GAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOE GERGEN, NEWSDAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The puck is dropped here. Here is the Meadowlands Arena where a third major 
confrontation between representatives of New York and New Jersey continued with 
Game 3 of the NHL's Eastern Conference finals Thursday night. It also was the 
sight of a recent showdown in the NBA playoffs in which, 13 nights earlier, the 
Knickerbockers eliminated the Nets. 
</P>
<P>
 That victory provided New York with a 1-0 advantage over New Jersey in the May 
sweeps competition between the states. The Stanley Cup series also tilted to 
the east after the Rangers skated to a 3-2 double-overtime triumph over the 
Devils, forging a 2-1 lead in the best-of-seven event. It may be some time 
before we learn the outcome of the other territorial fracas, one that also 
involves bragging rights. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, only 12 hours after the Devils had stunned the Rangers, 4-3, in 
double overtime of the series opener at Madison Square Garden, the Supreme 
Court issued an order permitting New Jersey to proceed with a lawsuit 
challenging New York's jurisdiction over Ellis Island. In effect, the justices 
agreed to resolve a long-running dispute over the 27.5-acre spit of land in New 
York Harbor that, along with neighboring Liberty Island, stands as a vibrant 
symbol of America's immigrant heritage. Freed from the tight schedule governing 
the hockey and basketball leagues, they may get around to debating the issue by 
the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the island clearly belongs to the federal government and was placed 
under the care of the National Park Service by President Lyndon B. Johnson in 
1965, both pride and prosperity have goaded the Garden State into legal action. 
Geographically, both the Great Hall that served as the gateway to the New World 
for generations of immigrants and the nearby Statue of Liberty are closer to 
the New Jersey shoreline, yet always have been associated with New York. The 
area code on island telephones is 212, not 201. 
</P>
<P>
 It is estimated that more than 80 percent of the 1.5 million annual visitors 
arrive on ferries from lower Manhattan as opposed to those running from Liberty 
State Park, near Jersey City. New Jersey would like a larger share of the 
tourist industry and is planning to build a footbridge to Ellis Island, a 
project authorized by Congress in 1992 but not scheduled for construction until 
1997. It would like to be permanently identified with the site of the national 
monument and museum that was opened in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 New Jersey is basing its claim on a 160-year-old interstate compact which 
placed the boundary between the states in the middle of the Hudson River but 
made the island, as it then existed, an extension of New York State. All that 
existed at the time, however, was three acres which one-time owner Samuel Ellis 
identified as "that pleasant situated island ... lying in York Bay" in a New 
York newspaper ad that failed to elicit a buyer. Dirt tunneled from under New 
York by sandhogs constructing the subway subsequently were dumped on Ellis 
Island, swelling its size eightfold. 
</P>
<P>
 According to New Jersey's suit, the additional 24.5 acres are within its 
jurisdiction under a clause of the compact, approved by Congress, that deeded 
it the land then underwater as well as various wharves and piers on the 
shoreline. It is asking the Court to declare New York's jurisdiction be limited 
to "the former mean high water line of the original natural island." 
</P>
<P>
 Standing at the information desk in the first-floor Baggage Room Thursday, 
Park Ranger Eugene Kuziw tried to place the dispute in layman's terms. 
"Anything above the water line is New York, anything below is New Jersey," he 
said wryly. "There was a ferry in the slip when the island was deserted in 
1954. It was sitting in New York but then it sank into New Jersey." 
</P>
<P>
 Mind you, the man wasn't taking sides. Ellis Island belongs to all Americans, 
as the cross-section of yesterday's visitors demonstrated. People of all ages, 
from small groups of senior citizens to large clumps of schoolchildren, roamed 
through the three-story restored building and braved the rain outside to check 
for family names on the curving American Immigrant Wall of Honor. 
</P>
<P>
 A person fixated on the current hockey series noted the names included a 
Michael Francis Keenan, a Robert and Elizabeth Leetch, several immigrants named 
Lemieux and many Richters. Although it has been a long time since America was 
known as "the melting pot," both the Rangers and the Devils could qualify as 
exercises in cultural bonding. The home team dressed two Russians, a Czech and 
a Swede as well as the usual assortment of Canadians and Americans. Four 
Russians and a Finn spiced the roster of the Rangers.

 Tom Lehman, who has yet to win on the PGA Tour, though he came close in the 
Masters, shot a bogey-free 67 and took a two-shot lead Friday at the halfway 
point of Jack Nicklaus' Memorial tournament at Dublin, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
 Lehman completed two trips over the Muirfield Village Golf Club course in 134, 
10 under par. 
</P>
<P>
 His experience at the Masters last month, where he led through three rounds 
before finishing second, should be beneficial as he makes another run at his 
first victory, Lehman said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I learned that my game is sound enough to stand up to that kind of pressure," 
Lehman said. "I feel I am strong enough emotionally, my swing is sound enough, 
to withstand the pressure." 
</P>
<P>
 The pressure is growing as a result of his near-miss at Augusta, Ga. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was frustrating," he said. "Now, every time I start playing good, there is 
more pressure to win." 
</P>
<P>
 He won't have to contend with Nick Faldo of England or Nicklaus, the host, 
tournament founder and two-time Memorial winner. Both missed the cut. 
</P>
<P>
 John Cook and David Edwards share second place at 136. 
</P>

 Raymond Floyd tied an Upper Montclair Country Club course record with an 
eight-under-par 64 and took a three-stroke lead after the first round of the 
Cadillac NFL Golf Classic at Clifton, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
 Floyd, who came down with food poisoning and lost last year's event by two 
strokes to Lee Trevino, had no bogeys and eight birdies, four on each nine, in 
tying the course record set by Orville Moody in 1970. 
</P>
<P>
 George Archer, with a 67, was the only player within five shots of Floyd, who 
has already won three times this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Houston Oiler kicker Al Del Greco successfully defended his NFL players 
championship shooting a three-over-par 75, giving him a 232 total for three 
rounds.

JAZZ REVIEW; HARGROVE QUINTET DELIVERS A ONE-NOTE PERFORMANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD FEATHER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Roy Hargrove, whose quintet played at Ambassador Ambassador on Thursday, is 
one of a number of young trumpeters who have invariably been hailed as the next 
Dizzy or the next Miles. Like Terence Blanchard and others in this group, 
Hargrove is equipped with exceptional technique, along with a powerful tone and 
attack. 
</P>
<P>
 But his performance Thursday failed to live up to the expected high level 
because he seemed a little too determined to please the audience at all costs. 
The first and last numbers during the opening half of the show began with 
Hargrove playing alone and the band lamely clapping along on the after beats. 
</P>
<P>
 Too often Hargrove sounded as if he were being paid by the note. His horn 
mate, tenor saxophonist Ron Blake, was guilty of similar excesses. At one point 
he employed the kind of audience-milking used decades ago in the old Jazz at 
the Philharmonic concerts. Of course it worked -- the wilder his blowing, the 
louder the approval of the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 Hargrove came off best playing fluegelhorn in "When We Were One," and in the 
concert's only ballad-standard, "The Nearness of You," during which he revealed 
a capacity for lyricism he shows too rarely. 
</P>
<P>
 The concert ended on a sour note with Hargrove's abysmal attempt to sing 
"September in the Rain." LEONARD FEATHER

THEATER REVIEW; A SEETHING 'OLEANNA' AT THE OLD GLOBE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY CHURNIN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Old Globe Theatre's angry, throbbing production of David Mamet's "Oleanna" 
proves the play has earned the rage generated since it opened Off-Broadway last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 A female student accuses a male professor of sexual harassment. At first, over 
a series of three meetings, you think the student is crazy to interpret 
harassment in their admittedly tense exchanges. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, as you hear her pain, you think maybe she has a point. Then, when she 
makes conditions for removing her career-busting complaints, you wonder if this 
wasn't a case of blackmail from the beginning. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oleanna" plays in Anita Hill and Paula Jones territory. Did he or didn't he? 
Are we in the realm of actions, interpretation of actions or ambush? 
</P>
<P>
 Is the play part of an anti-feminist, anti-political correctness backlash or 
has Mamet put his finger on the pulse of power -- who has it, how to get it? 
</P>
<P>
 The Old Globe production stars William Anton as John and Kathleen Dennehy as 
Carol. They are terrific. Artistic director Jack O'Brien, fresh from the breezy 
and romantic "Damn Yankees" on Broadway, astonishes with his ability to expose 
every nerve. It's a fast-paced squash game -- with the ball bouncing off walls 
from every direction. 
</P>
<P>
 Anton delivers a strong, layered performance, moving from complacency to fury 
as his adversary sends his walls tumbling down. But it's Dennehy, daughter of 
actor Brian Dennehy, who saves her part from shrill rhetoric. With long, 
expressive fingers fluttering like the broken wings of a bird and a voice that 
summons anguish up from seemingly bottomless depths, she makes you care about 
this lost soul even as she makes the man pay out of proportion to his crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 The play has weaknesses. Once she accuses him of rape, can we still believe 
this is misinterpretation? Then there's her offer to drop charges if he will 
ban a list of books. The list could have been used as proof of blackmail. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the production itself is as good as can be. While the show would have 
been more in-your-face in a smaller theater, Robert Brill's set tells its own 
tale with walls that extend up like the conflict, with no end in sight. David 
C. Woolard's costuming suggests the rending class conflict while Ashley York 
Kennedy's lighting humanizes the whole. 
</P>
<P>
 And, in the end, if good theater stimulates debate, then this is good theater. 
There will be a free discussion panel about sexual harassment at the Old Globe 
Monday at 7 p.m. For reservations, call (619) 231-1941, Ext. 2201. 
</P>

p.m.; Sat.-Sun. matinees, 2 p.m.; Sundays, 7 p.m. Ends June 26. $23-$34. (619)

 69th Assembly Race -- The news quiz column last Monday incorrectly described 
allegations being made in the Democratic primary by candidates Ted R. Moreno 
and Zeke Hernandez. Hernandez claims Moreno offered him $10,000 to drop out of 
the race; Moreno claims Hernandez illegally tape-recorded telephone 
conversations. Both candidates deny the allegations, and the district attorney 
is investigating.

MORNING BRIEFING: THOSE NARROW DEFEATS CAN TAKE THEIR TOLL BACK IN THE BARN TOO

 Race horses can give bettors ulcers, and perhaps the opposite is true. 
</P>
<P>
 Lottery Winner, a 5-year-old gelding who ran fourth in last Saturday's Mervyn 
LeRoy Handicap at Hollywood Park, receives treatment for a stomach condition.  
</P>
<P>
 "We've been treating him three times a day since the ulcers were discovered 
about a year ago," trainer Jay Robbins said. "He gets a little cranky if he 
misses his medication." 
</P>
<P>
 The Daily Racing Form makes notations when horses race with permitted 
medications such as the anti-bleeding drug Lasix. So far, there is no 
designation for the medication Lottery Winner receives: milk of magnesia.

 Vintage knees: Philip Marone, whose clients include the Philadelphia Phillies, 
performed arthroscopic knee surgeries May 13 on four patients, among them John 
Kruk and coach Mike Ryan. Marone said of the four: "The best knee I saw 
belonged to a 77-year-old woman."

 Rapping Raptors: Scott Ostler of the San Francisco Chronicle, commenting on 
the nickname of the Toronto expansion team in the NBA, the Raptors: 
</P>
<P>
 "The Raptors' publicists proudly point out that the raptor was the most 
intelligent of dinosaurs, which, when you think about it, is probably not 
lavish praise. 
</P>
<P>
 "And if fans really wanted intelligent mascots, they would lobby for the Utah 
Classical Music and the San Francisco Intellectual Giants."

 Mistaken identity: Marv Albert tells this story about Mike Tyson, who happened 
to meet a boxing reporter from the UPI wire service.

 One of Tyson's associates whispered: "No, no Mike. That was UPS."

 Strange range: A misguided Canada goose has spent the last two weeks nesting 
on piles of golf balls at a driving range in Lakeville, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the goose is frustrated," range owner Lynne Petrowski told the 
Enterprise of Brockton. "I'd be frustrated too if I had 6,000 golf balls to sit 
on. That's just too many eggs."

IT'S BUSINESS AS USUAL FOR ANGELS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Given the name "the Angels," it has always struck me as ironic that Tommy 
Lasorda long ago beat out his Angel counterparts in laying claim to the "Big 
Dodger in the Sky." But if the halo fits, wear it -- and it sure fits the 
Dodgers better than the Angels. 
</P>
<P>
 The Buck Rodgers incident reminded me of an essential difference between the 
two franchises: Magic. The pride and stability engendered by an organization 
that concentrates on finding and developing talent, rather than simply hiring a 
new steward every year or so, creates an intangible quality that somehow 
transcends the day's particular situation. The 1988 Dodgers clearly had it; the 
1982 Angels clearly did not. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels should have given Buck Rodgers a contract for life and then 
concentrated on giving him winning players and organizational pride. 
Unfortunately, the only way the Angels will get their "Magic" is if he (yet 
again) comes out of retirement to join his buddy Michael at the ol' ballyard.

 A recap of poor overall Angel performance of .483 under managers over the past 
33 years didn't compare ownership's poor performance in picking winning 
managers. During this stretch, they chose only four of 18 managers who produced 
records over .500 (Gene Mauch did it twice), thus ownership guessed right a 
little over one out of five times. 
</P>
<P>
 How about trading for new ownership?

<P>
 Former Miami Dolphin wide receiver Mark Duper and his brother-in-law were 
arrested early Friday in a sting operation in Pompano Beach, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 According to spokesman Jim Shedd of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency, Duper 
and Brian Briggs attempted to buy a kilogram (2.2 pounds) of cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
 Duper, 35, and Briggs, 25, were charged with conspiracy to possess cocaine 
with intent to distribute it and with possession of cocaine. Both were freed on 
$200,000 bond.

 Former players said reports of cash payoffs within the Miami football program 
were exaggerated, while university officials expressed surprise at the 
allegations and began to investigate. 
</P>
<P>
 Possible NCAA infractions from 1986 to 1992 surfaced in a story in the Miami 
Herald, which interviewed more than 30 former players. 
</P>
<P>
 According to their allegations, players won cash incentives ranging from $50 
for a fumble recovery to $500 for a touchdown. Former Hurricanes playing in the 
NFL supposedly bankrolled the incentive pools, with help from rap star Luther 
Campbell. 
</P>
<P>
 Quarterback Steve Walsh, who led Miami to a 12-0 record and the national 
championship in 1987, said that time might have distorted memories. 
</P>
<P>
 "Things get exaggerated after the fact while looking back four and five 
years," he said. "Maybe $250 for this was actually $20. I don't buy it." 
</P>
<P>
 He and former Miami tight end Randy Bethel confirmed a "hit pool," funded by 
the players with the winnings going to the teammate who made the biggest hit in 
a game. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Dennis Erickson said he knew about the pool, and he ordered it stopped 
in 1989.

AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP; DOMES DAY FOR RANGERS AND RED SOX

From Associated Press

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Less than six weeks after Boston scored 22 runs in a drubbing of Kansas City, 
the Red Sox learned how it feels. 
</P>
<P>
 The Texas Rangers, who also got pounded under the cover of a dome, could 
commiserate. 
</P>
<P>
 It feels pretty bad, actually. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody got hurt, so that's one good thing," Manager Butch Hobson said Friday 
at the Metrodome in Minneapolis after the Minnesota Twins got 22 hits, 
including a club-record eight in a row in an 11-run fifth inning, and beat the 
Red Sox, 21-2. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were hitting everything we threw up there," Hobson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Texas Manager Kevin Kennedy had to feel pretty much the same after his Rangers 
were blasted, 19-2, by the Seattle Mariners, who got 20 hits at the Kingdome. 
</P>
<P>
 In Minneapolis, there were plenty of heroes for the Twins. As usual, Kirby 
Puckett was among them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel like every time I go up to the plate I'm going to get a hit," said 
Puckett, who had three of them and a career-high seven RBIs to help the Twins 
win their sixth in a row. "I feel if I get a good pitch I'm going to get a hit. 
But I'm just the same old Kirby." 
</P>
<P>
 Not quite. The same old Kirby was 0 for 16 against Boston reliever Todd 
Frohwirth. Puckett, who has seven hits in his last eight at-bats, hit a 
three-run homer against Frohwirth to spark the Twins' barrage in the fifth 
inning. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't believe I finally got a hit off him," said Puckett, whose seven RBIs 
were the most for the Twins since Randy Bush had eight against Texas in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Minnesota also set club records for RBIs (21) and largest winning margin (19 
runs) and tied a record by sending 16 men to the plate in the fifth. 
</P>
<P>
 Carlos Pulido (2-3) made a last-minute start in place of Scott Erickson. 
</P>
<P>
 The Twins raked five Boston pitchers, and the most effective Boston pitcher 
was the sixth, reserve outfielder Andy Tomberlin, who held Minnesota to no runs 
and one hit in the seventh and eighth innings. 
</P>
<P>
 In Seattle, Edgar Martinez hit one of the Mariners' five homers and had a 
career-high five RBI as they set a team record for runs. 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez capped Seattle's record outburst with a two-run homer in the seventh 
inning. He also had an RBI single in the first and a two-run double in the 
fourth. 
</P>
<P>
 Ken Griffey Jr. hit his major-league leading 18th homer, a two-run shot in the 
first inning, to start the rout. The homer was Griffey's 11th this month and 
the 150th of his career. Griffey has homered in six of the last nine games. 
</P>
<P>
 Tino Martinez added a two-run shot for Seattle, Reggie Jefferson had a 
three-run homer and Torey Lovullo hit one with the bases empty. 
</P>
<P>
 Toronto 2, Cleveland 0 -- Pat Hentgen's pitching and Joe Carter's hitting 
enabled the host Blue Jays to end Cleveland's eight-game winning streak and 
improve their record to 20-20. 
</P>
<P>
 Carter, who leads the majors in runs batted in with 51, drove in the two runs 
with his 13th home run after a two-out double by Paul Molitor in the first 
inning. 
</P>
<P>
 Hentgen (6-3) gave up just four hits, struck out eight and walked one in 
pitching his second shutout this month. He had to be sharp because the Indians' 
Charles Nagy (3-3) was brilliant after the first inning. He went the distance, 
striking out nine. 
</P>
<P>
 New York 5, Baltimore 1 -- On a night when many American League hitters were 
on a rampage, Jim Abbott turned in another sparkling pitching performance at 
New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Abbott (5-2) held the Orioles to six hits in seven plus innings and enabled 
the Yankees to extend their lead in the East to 1 1/2 games over Boston. 
</P>
<P>
 Randy Velarde was the star as the Yankees scored all their runs in the fourth 
inning. Velarde hit his first home run of the season, a three-run blast. 
</P>
<P>
 The Yankees' Paul O'Neill walked twice and singled twice to raise his major 
league-leading average to an amazing .465. 
</P>
<P>
 Detroit 10, Milwaukee 4 -- Tony Phillips and Lou Whitaker put on a hitting 
clinic at Detroit to send the Brewers down to their ninth defeat in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 The top two guys in the batting order delivered a one-two punch. Between them 
they had eight hits in nine at-bats, scored six runs and drove in five runs. 
</P>
<P>
 Phillips, the lead-off hitter, made the only out. But he had a double and his 
fifth home run, scored four runs and drove in two. 
</P>
<P>
 Whitaker hit his eighth home run and was four for four. 
</P>
<P>
 John Doherty (5-3) got the victory.  
</P>
<P>
 Chicago 13, Oakland 6 -- Darrin Jackson had four hits, including his sixth 
home run, and drove in five runs to lead the White Sox rout of the Athletics. 
The White Sox scored eight runs in the second to make it easy for Alex 
Fernandez (4-5), who gave up two hits in seven innings.

DIVISION II BASEBALL PLAYOFFS; BREA-OLINDA WINS OPENER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Keeping scoreboard operators busy is as much a part of Brea-Olinda's game as 
donning baseball caps and stirrups. 
</P>
<P>
 And while the Wildcats hope to continue their offensive production throughout 
the Southern Section Division II playoffs, they realize they must save some 
muscle for when they're not at-bat. 
</P>
<P>
 Strong defense was the major reason Brea-Olinda defeated Sunny Hills, 6-2, 
Friday in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
 Brea-Olinda (22-4) did not commit an error and made several standout plays in 
the field, including a key double play in the sixth inning. The support enabled 
starter Steve Trombly (10-1) to toss a complete game with six strikeouts. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wildcats, Orange League co-champion, play Canyon on Tuesday in the second 
round. The Lancers (13-14-1) finished second in the Freeway League. 
</P>
<P>
 With the Wildcats holding a 2-1 lead in the fourth inningand a runner at 
third, third baseman John Theis made a diving catch to his left to end the 
inning. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought that was one of the big plays in the game," Coach Steve Hiskey 
said. "They had a guy at third and if they get that one in, who knows." 
</P>
<P>
 Brea-Olinda led, 4-2, in the sixth when Theis completed the middle part of a 
difficult double play, stepping on third then throwing to first to end the 
inning and another threat by Sunny Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 "Actually, I was a little surprised (Trombly) threw it to me," Theis said. 
"You don't see that type of double play too often." 
</P>
<P>
 For one of the few times this season, the Wildcats did not reach double 
figures in hits. They were outhit, 6-5, which happens about as often as someone 
lowers their cholesterol level eating theater popcorn. 
</P>
<P>
 On offense, Brea-Olinda was led by catcher Mike Brambilla and left fielder 
Matt Weyant. Each had a double and two runs batted in. 
</P>
<P>
 Thanks to the incredibly wild pitching of Lancer starter Thomas Lee, 
Brea-Olinda jumped to a 2-0, first-inning lead. Lee walked two batters and hit 
two in the inning. JASON H. REID

<P>
 Tony Zuniga, who overcame a shaky first inning, gave up two hits over the 
final six innings of Saddleback's 6-3 victory over Trabuco Hills in the opening 
round of the Division III baseball playoffs Friday at Trabuco Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mustangs, Pacific Coast League champions, scored three unearned runs in 
the first inning before Zuniga (8-3) settled down.He retired 17 of the final 18 
batters he faced. 
</P>
<P>
 The Roadrunners collected 12 hits, including two doubles and a single by Eddie 
Mejia. 
</P>
<P>
 Saddleback (15-11) took a 1-0 lead in the first on a walk to Tony Torres, a 
stolen base and singles by Zuniga and Juan Chavez. 
</P>
<P>
 Trabuco Hills (19-7) countered with three runs in the first. Nick Punto was 
safe on an error, stole second. Jake Anderson was hit by a pitch. Brian 
Costello's single and Matt Rechner's double drove in the three runs. 
</P>
<P>
 Saddleback scored an unearned run in the second and threatened to take the 
lead in the third when Rechner's diving catch with two outs and the bases 
loaded ended the threat. 
</P>
<P>
 The Roadrunners took the lead for good in the fourth on Zuniga's sacrifice fly 
and Mejia's run-scoring double. 
</P>
<P>
 Saddleback added two in the seventh on Mike Grasse's bases-loaded single and 
Jerry Ortiz's squeeze. MIKE WOJCIECHOWSKI

DIVISION I SOFTBALL PLAYOFFS; FOOTHILL CHASES OFF THE GHOSTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN HENDERSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The last time Foothill won a Southern Section softball championship, Stefanie 
Noffsinger was a Huntington Beach sophomore who shut out the Knights in the 
Woodbridge tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 That memory was with Foothill Coach Joe Gonzales as he watched Noffsinger face 
Foothill in its first-round Southern Section Division I game Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hadn't seen her in two years," Gonzales said, "and I was scared to death." 
</P>
<P>
 There was no need. Foothill (22-6) scored twice in the first inning and 
advanced to Tuesday's second round against Kennedy with a 2-1 victory over one 
of the most dangerous pitchers in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Noffsinger (8-4) gave up only one earned run in 70 innings for the Oilers 
(15-10), but Foothill scored two in the first inning and protected its 2-1 lead 
over the next six. 
</P>
<P>
 Michelle Churnock had an infield single and Carley Rutledge's bunt went for a 
base hit, too, as Churnock took third. Rutledge stole second and Robin 
Tessman's squeeze bunt drove in Churnock. An out later, Amie Barnes' single to 
center drove in Rutledge. 
</P>
<P>
 "The killer was not getting (Rutledge on the sacrifice)," Oiler Coach Julie 
Anderson said. "The key factor was their speed. They're not going to beat 
people up, but as long as they keep the ball in play -- that's all it takes. 
They got one clutch hit." 
</P>
<P>
 The Knights also got two clutch defensive plays. 
</P>
<P>
 Huntington Beach's Sarah King tried to tie the score in the second on a 
two-out single to right field, but was thrown out on a Marisa Holmes-to-Tessman 
relay. Catcher Dawn Davidson made the block and the tag; it was Foothill's 
first play at the plate this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Pinch-runner Sandy Smith was thrown out after rounding second base on Walker's 
no-out sacrifice bunt in the third inning. It was the last time the Oilers 
would have someone at second. They had only one more runner in the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Marie Gieron (10-4) gave up only two hits -- including a leadoff double to 
Jessica Walker, who scored on Jennifer Krill's sacrifice fly. 
</P>
<P>
 Noffsinger surrendered five hits. Though she struck out 88 in 70 innings, she 
had only three against Foothill, which has no seniors. MARTIN HENDERSON

 The Mustangs (12-11) took a 1-0 lead in the first on a walk, sacrifice and a 
throwing error, but Woodbridge got the run back in the third on a double by 
Bernritter, a sacrifice bunt and an infield single by Alison Johnsen. 
</P>
<P>
 Trabuco Hills scored again in the fifth without a hit, when Bernritter fielded 
Kim Yankie's grounder and overthrew first-basemen Keri Byrd for a two-base 
error. Stephanie Rapel then laid down a bunt and Byrd attempted to get Yankie 
at third, but instead bounced the ball into left field. 
</P>
<P>
 After the Warriors tied the score in the fourth on an RBI groundout by 
Courtney Spelber, they added two runs in the fifth. 
</P>
<P>
 Mustang pitcher Natalie Galasso allowed the lead-off hitter to reach base for 
the fourth consecutive inning when she walked Bernritter. An infield single by 
Johnsen and a double steal put runners on second and third before Ashley Boone 
and Byrd came up with two two-out RBI singles. 
</P>
<P>
 Woodbridge added a run in the sixth when Spelber led off with a triple to 
right-center and scored on a wild pitch two batters later. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were a little tight early on," Dugard said. "But we realized we should be 
playing better and we finally started swinging the bat." 
</P>
<P>
 The Warriors will meet the Redondo Beach Redondo Tuesday in the second round. 
</P>
<P>
 In other Division III softball: 
</P>
<P>
 Laguna Hills 2, Moreno Valley Canyon Springs 0 -- Sumer McMahon hit a two-run 
single in the bottom of the sixth, driving in Misty Thompson and Jennifer 
Arzola for Laguna Hills (15-9). 
</P>
<P>
 In the top of the sixth, Therese Lee (9-5) worked out of a bases-loaded jam, 
and went on to pitch a two-hitter for Laguna Hills, which plays the winner of 
Montebello-Whittier La Serna game.

HUNTINGTON BEACH RECOVERS JUST IN TIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL ITAGAKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After watching his team win the first two games against fourth-seeded North 
Hollywood Harvard-Westlake, Huntington Beach Cach Rocky Ciarelli knew the fast 
start was too good to be true. 
</P>
<P>
 Harvard-Westlake rallied to win Games 3 and 4, then took the Oilers to as 
close as two points of elimination before Huntington Beach responded by winning 
four consecutive points to win Game 5, 15-13, and win the Southern Section 
Division I boys' volleyball quarterfinal match Friday at Huntington Beach High. 
</P>
<P>
 The unseeded Oilers (19-2) advanced with a 15-5, 15-8, 7-15, 4-15, 15-3 
victory. They will play top-seeded El Toro in the semifinals Wednesday. 
Harvard-Westlake ended 19-2. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Grave had 28 kills, eight in Game 5, to lead Huntington Beach. But strong 
middle play from Nick Ziegler, who had 14 kills and five blocks, and Brad 
Simons helped key the Oiler victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Ziegler had nine kills and three blocks in Games 1 and 2, but was ineffective 
in Games 3 and 4. 
</P>
<P>
 Ziegler had one kill in Games 3 and 4, and Ciarelli benched Simon in both 
games in favor of Sean Tucker. 
</P>
<P>
 But nothing seemed to slow the Wolverine attack as setter Court Young, who had 
94 assists, kept the Oilers off-balance, setting a variety of players. 
</P>
<P>
 Harvard-Westlake middle blocker Seth Rodsky had a match-high 29 kills. Pete 
Kiefer had 25 kills, Matt Sebree 19 and Ryan Hudson added 16 for the 
Wolverines, who never quit during the 2-hour-45-minute match. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told our guys after we got up, we have to stay in it," Ciarelli said. 
"Volleyball is like that where the momentum can swing . . . you can't let a 
team up." 
</P>
<P>
 Harvard-Westlake appeared to complete the comeback when Sebree blocked Grave 
to give the Wolverines a 13-11 lead in Game 5. 
</P>
<P>
 But Huntington Beach's Jeremy Bart, who had 13 kills, spiked for a point from 
the left side to end a long rally and put the Oilers a point down, 13-12. 
</P>
<P>
 Bart's spike seem to take a lot out of Harvard-Westlake. The Wolverines, who 
made few errors in Games 3, 4, and 5, committed three consecutive errors to 
help the Oilers to victory. 
</P>
<P>
 After Young inadvertently set the ball over the net and out of bounds to give 
Huntington Beach a 14-13 lead, Sebree shanked a pass on Grave's serve at match 
point. 
</P>
<P>
 While Huntington Beach fans mobbed the players on the Oilers' half of the 
floor, Harvard-Westlake's players sat on the floor in disbelief. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think since Jeremy, Nick, and Mike have all been in (the Section) playoffs 
before, that experience helped," Ciarelli said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jody-Cook Fisher had 13 kills for Huntington Beach and setter Josh Moss had 67 
assists and five kills.

EL TORO'S 'WORST MATCH' GOOD ENOUGH TO WIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HEATHER STEVENS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In what Coach Mike Jagd called "the worst match we played all year," El Toro 
swept Palos Verdes Peninsula, 15-10, 15-5, 15-6, in a Southern Section Division 
I boys' volleyball quarterfinal match Friday at El Toro. 
</P>
<P>
 Jagd's Chargers frustrated him on two fronts: physical and mental."I'm trying 
to think who set well, who hit well -- nobody did," he said. The night's top 
performer, outside hitter Ryan Mariano, had only 13 kills. The Chargers ended 
the match with 13 serving errors. 
</P>
<P>
 "And the other team was real obnoxious," Jagd said. "They were talking through 
the net, and purposely bumped my assistant coach during changeovers. But my 
guys let it affect them. 
</P>
<P>
 "This late in the year we can have a breakdown like that -- what if we go up 
to play (North Hollywood) Harvard-Westlake, where everyone will be rooting 
against us? I'm real concerned about that," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 However, El Toro (18-1) will to be concerned about Huntington Beach in the 
semifinals. The Oilers beat Harvard-Westlake in five games. 
</P>
<P>
 Peninsula (14-3), which mustered only 21 kills in the match, led the first 
game until the Chargers tied the score, 10-10, on Mariano's ace and did not 
look back. Of Peninsula's 30 errors, 12 occurred in the first game. 
</P>
<P>
 The second and third games weren't so much a demonstration of El Toro's skills 
as an example of how to bungle: The Chargers finished with 27 errors. HEATHER 
STEVENS

TITANS END PLAYOFF SKID IN SOFTBALL; REGIONAL: MORTENSEN PITCHES A 2-1 VICTORY 
OVER WASHINGTON. FULLERTON WILL FACE TOP-SEEDED CAL STATE NORTHRIDGE TODAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LON EUBANKS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Cal State Fullerton's late-season softball surge rolled on in the NCAA 
playoffs Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Titans, who had lost three of four games to Washington in the regular 
season, packaged Jennifer Mortensen's six-hit pitching with error-free defense 
to beat the Huskies, 2-1, in the opening game of the NCAA regional. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory was Fullerton's 18th in the last 20 games and broke a four-game 
NCAA playoff losing streak. The Titans were eliminated in two games in the 
regional last year, and also lost their final two games in the 1992 tournament. 
Washington was ranked 10th in the nation; Fullerton is 20th. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton (33-27) plays at 10 a.m. today against top-seeded Cal State 
Northridge (47-7). The winner of that game will move on to Sunday's final; the 
loser will play again at 3 p.m. Northridge, ranked third in the nation, blasted 
Maine, 8-0, in a game that was stopped in the fifth inning on the mercy rule. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory was a emotional boost to the Titans, who beat pitcher Stephanie 
Burns for the first time this season after losing to her, 5-0 and 2-1, in the 
regular season. This time she was the victim of four errors and an offense that 
left 11 runners on base. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a big win for us," Mortensen said. "There's always a lot of emotion 
involved when these two teams play each other." 
</P>
<P>
 The victory also buoyed Fullerton Coach Judi Garman's hopes. "Our players 
really believe in themselves now," Garman said. "They're not falling apart in 
crucial situations the way they did at times early in the season. This team 
wasn't expected to be here, but now I really think we can win this thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Mortensen, who had early control problems, was strong under pressure. She 
walked two in the first inning but got away without allowing a run. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington did score in the second. Mortensen gave up a walk and a double to 
Leanne Rosser before another walk loaded the bases with one out. She got a 
force at the plate, but Shelly Brown's slap hit between shortstop and third 
scored the run. 
</P>
<P>
 The Titans had given Mortensen a one-run lead in the second when Rose Garces 
singled and Heidi Robertson's hit to left field was mishandled, allowing Garces 
to score. Fullerton scored the eventual winning run in the third when Jstone 
Vines reached base and advanced on a series of errors, scoring on Traci 
Fisher's sacrifice fly. 
</P>
<P>
 Mortensen pitched herself out of trouble again in the fifth after giving up 
singles to the first two batters. Strong play on the infield by Fisher and 
Laurie LoForti also helped. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was a little nervous at the start because it was the regional, but I felt I 
pitched well from the fourth inning on," Mortensen said. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington Coach Teresa Wilson felt the errors were costly. "Every close play 
went their way and if we score any of the 11 runners we left on base it's a 
different game," she said. "We just didn't get the clutch hits."

BELOVSKY'S TWO-HITTER HELPS CYPRESS ADVANCE IN PLAYOFFS

 Right-hander Josh Belovsky baffled Chaffey College, pitching a two-hit shutout 
to lead Cypress to a 4-0 victory in the first round of the Southern California 
State Regional Tournament Friday at Cypress College. 
</P>
<P>
 Belovsky (10-1) kept hitters off balance with a variety of pitches, striking 
out eight and walking two. The victory, a school-record 37th for the Chargers, 
put them into the tournament winners' bracket. 
</P>
<P>
 Cypress (37-10) will play Southwestern at 11 a.m. today at home. Chaffey 
(35-9) will play Cuesta at 10 a.m. at Fullerton College. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Belovsky) did an outstanding job," Charger Coach Scott Pickler said. "He was 
the difference today." 
</P>
<P>
 Belovsky, a sophomore from Orange High, survived a shaky start. He hit leadoff 
batter Ron Reyes and gave up a single to David Munoz. But he retired the next 
14 batters before walking Mario Najera in the fifth inning. Cypress had a 3-0 
lead by then. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was a little nervous (at the start) and was squeezing the ball," Belovsky 
said. "But I got settled down and knew I'd be all right. I was feeling good 
because it was a big game." 
</P>
<P>
 Chaffey starter Chad Albaugh (11-2) made several mistakes in the Chargers' 
three-run fourth inning. After Jason Hodges' leadoff single, Albaugh made an 
errant pickoff throw to first, balked and hit Andy Gonzales with a pitch to put 
runners on first and third. Dave Trentine singled to center, driving in the 
first run. 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzales scored on Eric Stevens' force at second, when Chaffey shortstop Mario 
Najera threw into the dirt at first base, attempting to complete a double play. 
After a another hit batsman, Gonzales scored from third on a wild pitch. 
</P>
<P>
 Cypress added a run in the seventh when pinch-runner Mario Opipari reached 
third on an errant pickoff attempt at second and scored on Israel Gonzalez's 
fly ball to right.

 Brian Martineau, with ninth-inning help from Kirk Irvine, turned in his best 
pitching performance of the season as Rancho Santiago beat host Los Angeles 
Harbor, 2-0, in a Southern California playoff game Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Martineau (5-3) gave up no runs and eight singles in eight-plus innings. He 
struck out seven and walked one. Martineau, a freshman right-hander from 
Riverside Arlington High School, gave up a leadoff single in the ninth and was 
replaced by Irvine, who got a force out and then a double-play to end the game. 
It was his second save. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Chavez of L.A. Harbor beat Rancho Santiago, 3-1, this season but gave up 
two runs in 8 2/3 innings to take the loss Friday. He is 9-2. 
</P>
<P>
 "Martineau is pitching as well as anybody in the state right now," Rancho 
Santiago Coach Don Sneddon said. "Their guy threw well but our guy was just 
better." 
</P>
<P>
 Rancho Santiago (36-10) advances to play Riverside at 11 a.m. today in the 
winners' bracket at Harbor. Riverside beat Citrus, 8-6, Friday. The Tigers won 
three of four games against Rancho Santiago, the defending State champion, in 
Orange Empire Conference play earlier this season. Brandon Hoalton (11-2) is 
scheduled to start for Rancho Santiago. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the third time in four seasons L.A. Harbor (31-13) has played host to a 
regional and lost in the first round. The Seahawks play Citrus at 10 a.m. at El 
Camino. The loser is eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
 Rancho Santiago was limited to six hits Friday, but two made the difference. 
</P>
<P>
 Jason Minici hit the second pitch of the sixth inning well over the left-field 
fence to put Rancho Santiago ahead, 2-0. It was his ninth home run. Minici, who 
also had a single, was the only Don with two hits. 
</P>
<P>
 The other run was scored in the first. With two outs, Toby Sanchez and Darren 
Troilo walked. Chavez got ahead of Daryle Ward, no balls and two strikes, but 
Ward lined a high fastball into left field for an RBI single. 
</P>
<P>
 Martineau dominated early, getting his seven strikeouts in the first five 
innings. 
</P>
<P>
 L.A. Harbor's best chance to score came in the eighth, when the Seahawks had 
two on and one out. But Martineau got out of the inning with the help of a pick 
off. 
</P>
<P>
 Rancho Santiago's second baseman Joe Fraser moved in behind Josh Bendik and 
Martineau threw to second well ahead of Bendik for the second out. 
</P>
<P>
 Martineau got designated-hitter Anthony Mack to ground into a force play to 
end the eighth. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was the first time we've picked (at second) all year," Martineau said. "I 
just looked at Joe and he nodded and then I nodded and he got in behind."

UCLA'S PHEBUS UPSETS TOP-SEEDED PLAYER AT NCAA TENNIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Unseeded Keri Phebus of UCLA upset top-seeded Laxmi Poruri of Stanford, 6-3, 
1-6, 6-3, Friday to advance to the singles finals of the NCAA Women's Tennis 
Championships. 
</P>
<P>
 Phebus, a former Corona del Mar High star, defeated her Pac-10 rival for the 
first time and will meet No. 3 Angela Lettiere of Georgia in today's 
championship match.Lettiere defeated Mississippi's Paloma Collantes for the 
third time this year in the other semifinal, 7-6 (8-6), 6-1. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people have doubted my ability, and I always seem to be seeded 
lower," Phebus said. "This was more of a battle from within. I wanted this for 
myself. I didn't want to get too wrapped up in what everybody else has been 
expecting from me." 
</P>
<P>
 With the title match between a Pac-10 and Southeastern Conference player, the 
NCAA champion will come from one of those two conferences for the 13th 
consecutive year. The Pac-10 has won eight titles, the SEC four. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was tired today," Poruri said. "I played my game plan the whole way 
through, and today the fatigue finally got to me. I was exhausted. I lost the 
match more than she won it." 
</P>
<P>
 Phebus (32-7) carries a seven-match winning streak into the final. 
</P>
<P>
 Lettiere (45-14) said the turning point came when she trailed, 3-5, in the 
first-set tiebreaker and came up with a good volley to win the point. 
</P>
<P>
 "After the tiebreaker, I think she started getting down," Lettiere said. 
"She's the type of player that can make winners from anywhere on the court." 
</P>
<P>
 In the doubles quarterfinals, Phebus and teammate Susie Starrett were defeated 
by Rebecca Jensen and Nora Koves of Kansas, 6-4, 7-6 (8-6).

BEAR KILLED BY POLICE IN AZUSA NEIGHBORHOOD; WILDLIFE: TWO TRANQUILIZER DARTS 
FAIL TO DOWN THE ANIMAL. SOME OF THE FOOTHILL AREA'S RESIDENTS OBJECT TO THE 
SLAYING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A 350-pound bear from the Angeles National Forest lumbered onto a residential 
street Friday morning in Azusa and was killed by police, the latest casualty in 
the turf war between wildlife in Southern California's mountains and the reach 
of urbanization into the foothills. 
</P>
<P>
 Although state Department of Fish and Game wardens sought to remove the bear, 
hitting it twice with darts filled with tranquilizers, the drugs had little 
effect. 
</P>
<P>
 The woozy bear loped past police car barricades and was felled at 7:30 a.m. by 
14 shells from four shotgun-wielding officers who sped after the creature in a 
flatbed truck after the animal turned toward town. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were hoping he'd go down" from the drugs, said Azusa Police Sgt. James 
Collins, the officer in charge at the scene. "But at that time of day, with 
kids going to school, we knew . . . we were going to have to kill it. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was definitely a threat. It was definitely out of control," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As many as half a dozen bears wander into urban areas each year from the 
mountains stretching from Ventura County to San Bernardino County, said Larry 
Sitton, a senior biologist with the fish and game agency. 
</P>
<P>
 But the rare intrusions appear to be increasing as houses built snug against 
mountain foothills shrink open space and make people a more familiar and less 
threatening sight to wildlife, said Patrick Moore, an agency spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Last August two young black bears were killed in the San Bernardino Mountains 
after one of them mauled a 12-year-old Boy Scout. Last September a mountain 
lion was slain after it attacked a 10-year-old girl in Cuyamaca Rancho State 
Park. And last month in the hills northeast of Sacramento a woman jogger died 
after being mauled by a cougar, which was later hunted down and killed by 
authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 The animal slain Friday was a California black bear, one of an estimated 60 
adult bears that live in the Angeles National Forest, Sitton said. 
</P>
<P>
 The bears are not native to the region but were brought in from Yosemite and 
Kings Canyon in the 1920s and 1930s in an effort to preserve the species, 
Sitton said. California now has 3,000 to 5,000 of the bears. 
</P>
<P>
 The slain bear may have been looking for food. California black bears come out 
of hibernation from February to April and hungrily seek to pack on pounds, 
having lost up to two-fifths of their body weight over the winter. But at this 
time of year food is scarce and the bears wander, following their keen sense of 
smell looking for food, Sitton said. 
</P>
<P>
 This also is breeding season, which impels many bears to wander in search of 
mates, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The animal apparently ambled down Hilltop Drive, which dead-ends into Glendora 
Ridge Mountainway, a road that leads up into the forest, neighbors said. 
</P>
<P>
 An Azusa police officer spotted the bear lying in the middle of Sierra Madre 
Avenue about 4 a.m. As the officer radioed for assistance, the bear wandered 
off into a cul-de-sac in the 1300 block of Alameda Court. It hunkered down in a 
back corner of Gil Trujillo's carport behind Trujillo's 21-foot ski boat and 
next to a neighbor's fence. 
</P>
<P>
 "I looked out and I could just see the butt end of the bear sticking out from 
behind the boat," said Trujillo, 65, a retired Azusa police lieutenant. 
</P>
<P>
 The bear wandered between the boat and Trujillo's Cadillac as half a dozen 
cars and trucks from the Azusa and Glendora police departments, the Fish and 
Game Department and the San Gabriel Valley Humane Society blocked off the 
neighboring streets and surrounded the house. The bear padded back to a corner 
of the carport and rolled up in a ball. 
</P>
<P>
 After agreeing that police would have free rein to shoot if the bear broke 
through the perimeter, fish and game wardens at 7 a.m. fired one tranquilizer 
dart. Twenty minutes later they fired a second one. Neither brought down the 
bear, Moore said. 
</P>
<P>
 After the second shot, the bear stood on all fours and started walking down 
the driveway, said Marian Newcomb, whose house is directly across the street 
from Trujillo's. But as the bear reached the street, it turned right and was 
able to run through a gap in the police cars, she said.  
</P>
<P>
 Four Azusa officers armed with 12-gauge shotguns followed the bear in a 
flatbed truck and shot it, Collins said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Residents, many of whom phoned police after the bear's death, appeared upset, 
Collins said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't like the fact that we killed (the bear), but I'm going to bed tonight 
knowing nobody got hurt," Collins said. "Unfortunately, my duty to human life 
outweighs my duty to animals." 
</P>
<P>
 Newcomb, a 70-year-old retiree who watched the bear escape her cul-de-sac, 
shook her head when she talked about the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 "People build homes in mountainous areas and then act surprised when animals 
come to their homes," she said. "But these are the animals' homes." 
</P>
<P>
 "What's happening is we're driving the animals out of their habitats," said 
12-year-old Alex Sandoval, who had gathered an ashtray full of spent shells and 
strands of hair from his driveway, where the bear had fallen.

CITYSCAPES / JESSE KATZ: NO SANCTUARY HERE FROM CRIME -- OR PUNISHMENT; 'I HATE 
TO SEE ANYBODY GO TO JAIL, BUT IF THEY CAN'T LIVE OUT HERE IN SOCIETY, THEN 
THAT'S WHERE THEY BELONG.'

 The God-fearing folk at the Imperial Church of Christ believe that even the 
most troubled souls can be redeemed. They have studied Jesus' words about the 
virtues of forgiveness. They know it's best to turn the other cheek. 
</P>
<P>
 But don't expect them to shed any tears for Harry (Pookie) Cheatham, the 
suspected thief who allegedly ransacked their South-Central Los Angeles church 
on Mother's Day. Under California's new "three strikes and you're out" law, the 
27-year-old ex-con could go to prison for the rest of his life. 
</P>
<P>
 "Adios, amigo," said an unapologetic Sampson Wiley, the church's minister of 
music. "He had his chance." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Even before this month's break-in, the church brethren had grown frustrated in 
their battle against Satan's pernicious pull. 
</P>
<P>
 A spiked, six-foot-high, wrought-iron fence rings the property at San Pedro 
Street and Imperial Highway. Thick bars cover the sanctuary's stained-glass 
windows. The burglar alarm, which alerts officers at the Los Angeles Police 
Department's Southeast Division, gets triggered every few months. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember when churches didn't even have to lock their doors," said Wiley, 
58, who joined Imperial Church of Christ a year after its founding in 1953. 
"Basically, people have lost respect for a supreme being." 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, bullets have whizzed into the church's blue stucco walls. A 
rock was hurled through a chapel window. Batteries have been snatched from cars 
parked out front. Not long ago, robbers burst into a Bible class, stealing 
everyone's jewelry and cash. 
</P>
<P>
 These days, a church elder is stationed outside during services, standing 
sentry as worshipers come and go. The Tuesday night Bible class now begins an 
hour earlier, allowing congregants to head home before darkness falls. The 
church still opens its food pantry every Thursday for the poor, but that did 
not stop someone from breaking in on a recent Saturday night and stealing all 
the cereal left out for the Sunday school's breakfast. 
</P>
<P>
 "As a Christian, part of my duty is to live within the law," said Robert 
McKinzie, 61, a retired postal worker who has spent three decades serving the 
church. "I hate to see anybody go to jail, but if they can't live out here in 
society, then that's where they belong. I may feel sorry for the guy, but the 
law's the law." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Pookie Cheatham, an unemployed resident of the Nickerson Gardens housing 
project in Watts, has not done well living within the law. Court records show 
that he acquired three felony convictions over the last decade, each time the 
result of bungled thievery. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1984, he was caught trying to steal an Atari video set from the living room 
of a South-Central man, who jumped on Cheatham and held him until police could 
arrive. In 1985, he used a toy gun to rob a man of $22, then was arrested a few 
blocks away trying to buy a hamburger. In 1987, he took a car at gunpoint, but 
did not get far because he could not release the emergency brake. 
</P>
<P>
 The first offense earned him 180 days in jail. The second one got him two 
years in prison. After the third felony, he was sentenced to a 10-year term and 
ordered to pay $300 for the burned-out transmission. He was paroled in 
December. 
</P>
<P>
 Ronnie Wherry, a 42-year-old disabled veteran, lives a block away from the 
Imperial Church of Christ, which employs him as a part-time maintenance man. 
When the alarm goes off, as it did shortly before midnight on May 8, Wherry 
cleans up the mess. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, a burglar had pried open the church door and trashed a storage room 
that contained soap and razors for the homeless. The suspect also was trying to 
yank out a stereo system from behind the pulpit, but police arrived and ordered 
him out of the church. The man fled through a side door and ran to the back 
yard of a home. That is where officers arrested Cheatham, hiding behind a bush. 
</P>
<P>
 "We make our own heaven and hell," Wherry said a few days after Cheatham's 
arraignment for second-degree burglary, one of more than 260 "three strike" 
cases filed in Los Angeles County. "You can't blame it on anybody else." 
</P>
<P>
 It is a lesson Wherry learned the hard way. Before he found religion, he said, 
he too lived as an outlaw, stealing to feed his cravings for alcohol and 
cocaine. He knows that economic factors fuel much of today's crime, that most 
criminals are addicts, that drugs are just a salve for those who cannot bear 
their spiritual pain. 
</P>
<P>
 But Wherry also believes there is only one way out of that self-destructive 
spiral. If society chooses to deal with the problem by building more prisons, 
so be it. If Cheatham gets his third strike, then that is just the price he 
will pay. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our main goal is to make it to heaven," Wherry said. "For that, there's only 
one righteous judge." 
</P>
<P>
 A judge whose mercy transcends even prison walls.

DATE RAPE ALLEGATION IGNITES A FUROR AT POMONA COLLEGE; EDUCATION: A JUNIOR DID 
NOT OBJECT TO SEX AT THE TIME BUT ACCUSES A FELLOW STUDENT 2 1/2 YEARS LATER. A 
BLOCKED HEARING AND A PENDING LAWSUIT FRAME THE ISSUE -- CAN THE SCHOOL ACT 
WHERE A COURT MIGHT NOT? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 As Pomona College students filed solemnly toward the stage at the school's 
commencement ceremony, one graduating senior accepted her diploma, then 
unfurled a banner and displayed it to the audience and the faculty on stage. 
</P>
<P>
 "A Rapist Is Among Us," the banner proclaimed. 
</P>
<P>
 The boos and cheers that followed the woman as she returned to her seat typify 
the sharply divided sentiments, on campus and off, over a case of alleged 
sexual assault that has become the latest chapter in a national debate over 
what constitutes rape, and how far colleges can go in "trying" accusations 
against students. 
</P>
<P>
 A female junior charges, 2 1/2 years after the fact, that she was raped by a 
fellow student after an evening of drinking. She concedes that she never voiced 
an objection to having sex and has not explained why she waited so long to 
complain. She brought a formal complaint to the college, which scheduled a 
disciplinary hearing that could result in the expulsion of the accused man. He, 
in turn, filed a lawsuit to keep the college from holding the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 The complex case, with its overtones of sexual miscommunication in a 
freewheeling sexual era, has divided both the campus and advocates of women's 
rights. Several students at the Claremont Colleges, which include Pomona, held 
a series of protests on the woman's behalf, saying her experience typifies the 
subtler forms of sexual assault. Someone scrawled "Dead Men Don't Rape" on the 
school's graffiti wall; a note with the same words was slipped under the 
accused man's door. But a legal expert said she sees so many flaws in the 
accusation that she fears it could actually cause a backlash against the 
victims of sexual assaults. 
</P>
<P>
 "It provides ammunition to conservatives who would like to turn back the clock 
completely on date rape," said USC law professor Susan Estrich, who specializes 
in gender law. 
</P>
<P>
 No police report was ever filed in the Pomona College case; no criminal 
charges were ever brought against the man. For that reason, The Times is 
withholding his name. Times policy is not to identify alleged victims of rape. 
Both students refused to comment. 
</P>
<P>
 The case was to go before a disciplinary panel made up of 10 students a month 
ago, but was delayed indefinitely after the accused man's legal challenge. The 
court stay of his hearing allowed him to graduate May 16 but left open the 
possibility that his degree could be revoked if the disciplinary panel finds 
him guilty. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Before the students left campus for the summer, there was fierce debate. Some 
women held a silent vigil to protest the ruling, although they said they were 
not responsible for the threatening graffiti and in fact painted over it. On 
another occasion, though, while painting feminist mottoes on the wall, they 
were harassed by a group of men screaming obscenities. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit that fostered this painful rift during the last weeks of the 
semester has joined a growing number of cases that are putting college judicial 
procedures on trial, raising questions about the line between private 
discipline and public justice: How much authority do private colleges have to 
issue judgments on what might otherwise be criminal charges? To what extent can 
or should they regulate students' behavior? And can they deny a defendant at a 
disciplinary hearing an attorney and other rights guaranteed in the 
Constitution? 
</P>
<P>
 Such questions have surfaced in similar cases around the country. A Yale 
University basketball player who was expelled last year for an alleged rape 
sued the school over its disciplinary procedures. And a student accused of rape 
at Valparaiso University in Indiana demanded $12 million in compensatory and 
punitive damages, charging that the school violated his rights by excluding 
several defense witnesses from his hearing on the charge. Both cases are 
pending. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Because date rape is notoriously difficult to prosecute, schools have created 
rules that are broader and easier to apply than criminal codes, and that 
redefine rape and related conduct. 
</P>
<P>
 Pomona College's rules on sexual assault define consent according to the 
California penal code as "positive cooperation in act or attitude pursuant to 
an exercise of free will. The person must act freely and voluntarily. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 But it takes that a step further, adding: "Consent requires a clear, explicit 
agreement to engage in a specific activity." 
</P>
<P>
 The woman met the man at a Halloween party in 1991, when she was a freshman 
and he was a sophomore, she said in a written statement to the college's 
disciplinary panel. They were both drinking heavily, and at his suggestion they 
left the party for his room, where they began kissing and he undressed her. 
</P>
<P>
 She said she did not explicitly consent to have intercourse, but never 
indicated any objection. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, she said, "I lay there in shock and scared and mentally frozen." The 
incident has troubled her ever since and always will, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The next week, she expressed her shock and anger to him, and said he seemed 
sorry and sympathetic. Their occasional interactions afterward "could not have 
been more civil," she wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 More than two years later, though, she decided to bring disciplinary charges 
against him for reasons that neither she nor her friends will discuss. The 
accused man was summoned to appear before the disciplinary panel April 22, but 
filed a lawsuit against the school protesting the hearing. His lawsuit does not 
address the actual incident, just the college's right to hold a hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Two days before the man was to appear before a panel of students, a Superior 
Court judge stayed the hearing, allowing him to graduate, and set a new court 
date for next week to consider whether to allow the hearing at all and under 
what guidelines. The college asked the court to lift the injunction against the 
hearing, but the appeal was denied. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the events described in the female student's statement may be a 
violation of the student code, USC's Estrich said it most likely would not hold 
up in criminal court as date rape or any other crime. And that sets a dangerous 
precedent that could hurt those accused of rape and those victimized by it, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because the facts are so weak, because she waited two years, (because) there 
was no force used, (and) by her own statement she never clearly and 
unequivocally said no . . . to turn around and say to this young man, 'You're 
not going to graduate from college,' is really unfair," Estrich said. 
</P>
<P>
 Campus efforts to regulate sexual conduct have come under fire for what their 
critics say are rules so rigid as to lump social gaffes with violent assault. 
At Antioch College in Ohio, a rule requiring students to obtain explicit mutual 
consent before exchanging even a single kiss became the butt of "Saturday Night 
Live" skits. Some students at Pomona College, though, say their campus rule 
requiring explicit consent is not a joke, but an important safety measure. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there's too much gray area, and the rules they're making reduce the 
gray area," said William Clarkson, a recent graduate. "I guess it would reduce 
the risk of date rape, which is a very real threat." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Students learn about that rule in a workshop the first week of their freshman 
year, Clarkson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Consent at this college takes into account physical and psychological 
coercion," said senior Eumi Lee, who participated in protests against the 
hearing's delay. "It's all part of the basic social contract. If these charges 
are true then he has violated that." 
</P>
<P>
 Author Katie Roiphe, whose book, "The Morning After," disputes many date rape 
claims, contending that they are merely instances of regretted sex, said such 
rules can set back feminism. 
</P>
<P>
 Student codes on sexual conduct, she said, "read like a Victorian guide to 
conduct. It has a strong streak of puritanism. . . . I also think from a 
feminist point of view it's very dangerous to expand the definition of rape to 
include (lack of) explicit consent. Because the implication is that women are 
too gullible or too weak, or too innocent, too fragile to communicate on a very 
basic level." 
</P>
<P>
 In the case of the accused Pomona student, "to call him a rapist, and to 
respond to this as a rape, is something that in both a legal and feminist point 
of view undermines the integrity of the rape charge," Roiphe said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Diana Russell, author of "The Politics of Rape," "Rape in Marriage" and 
other studies of sexual assault, says more explicit sexual rules are needed, 
particularly in the age of AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are an enormous amount of myths about rape," said Russell, a professor 
emeritus at Mills College in Oakland. "Many men, particularly rapists, believe 
that women actually like rape. . . . Given how bad things are, (a code of 
conduct like Pomona College's) is a way of protecting. Some women may not need 
it, but others do, so you make your rules for everybody." 
</P>
<P>
 The school's disciplinary process differs from criminal proceedings; the 
burden of proof is lighter, and students are not allowed representation by 
attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our standard of proof is clear and consistent evidence," said Ann Quinley, 
the Pomona College dean of students. "It is possible for someone to be found 
guilty in a college hearing when they would not be in a court of law." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Although the school says the procedure allows it to maintain high standards of 
student conduct, the accused student's lawyer says it is unconstitutional. 
Attorney Howard Rosen said the college should not be deciding the case at all. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're not set up to deal with this charge, which is a very serious felony," 
Rosen said. "It's not the proper forum for that. . . . Do you really think if 
someone had been killed on this campus, this jury of juniors and seniors would 
convene to determine if it was premeditated or they acted in self-defense?" 
</P>
<P>
 Rosen also said the tense climate on campus precludes any chance of a fair, 
impartial hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because there have been death threats, because of the vigil, it's impossible 
for him to get a fair hearing at this college," Rosen said. "These students 
would not be allowed as jurors in a criminal trial." 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Diane Wayne said at the April 20 
hearing that she would decide in May whether the disciplinary hearing will 
proceed. She added, though, that school rules prohibiting the student from 
bringing an attorney to the college hearing are not appropriate in this case. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is such a serious charge, and the circumstances are seriously open to two 
divergent interpretations," Wayne said. "He is entitled to an attorney." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The statute of limitations for rape is six years, Wayne noted, so the student 
conceivably could be charged after the hearing. And if the accused student 
speaks at the hearing, his testimony could be used against him in a criminal 
trial, she said. Although the student would not be forced to testify, Rosen 
said declining would limit his client's ability to defend himself. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone has the right not to self-incriminate," Rosen said. "He has the 
choice between waiving his privilege and giving his version of events at the 
disciplinary hearing or remaining silent and forgoing the right to defend 
himself." 
</P>
<P>
 But Pomona College's attorney, Keith Johnson, argued that the student code of 
conduct is independent of criminal law. And, he said, the charge that the 
hearing violates the student's due process rights "would apply to public, but 
not to private, institutions." 
</P>
<P>
 Colleges "have a very long history, dating back to the Middle Ages, of 
autonomy in regulating their own environments," said Gary Pavela, an education 
lawyer and director of judicial programs at the University of Maryland. "It's 
particularly important in an allegation of violence that the college be able to 
determine for itself who can use its facilities."

KING JURY ASKS TO USE CHRISTOPHER REPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN L. MITCHELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jurors in Rodney G. King's lawsuit seemed nowhere near a decision on their 
fourth day of deliberations Friday as they asked the judge to provide video 
equipment and yellow highlighter pens and asked if the Christopher Commission 
report could be used as evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 The jury's note specified that it wanted equipment that plays frame by frame 
and in slow motion, indicating that members want to analyze the videotape of 
King's beating. 
</P>
<P>
 When U.S. District Judge John G. Davies said he did not have the equipment at 
hand, attorneys for King purchased a $416 state-of-the-art VCR and rushed it to 
the courtroom before the jury retired for the weekend at 3 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 "They seem to know that they are doing something historic, and they are being 
very careful," said Milton Grimes, an attorney for King. 
</P>
<P>
 John Burris, another of King's attorneys, joked to reporters that they should 
"bring camping gear." 
</P>
<P>
 The jury is weighing evidence in the punitive damage phase of the trial. The 
same panel awarded King $3.8 million in compensatory damages from the city 
April 19 during the first phase of the trial. 
</P>
<P>
 King's lawyers have asked the jury to award between $3.8 million and $15 
million in punitive damages from former Los Angeles Police Sgt. Stacey C. Koon; 
former Officers Theodore J. Briseno, Laurence M. Powell and Timothy E. Wind, 
and current Officers Rolando Solano and Louis Turriaga.  
</P>
<P>
 The jury request on whether information from the Christopher Commission report 
could be used as evidence touched off a brief debate in the courtroom.  
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorneys objected to Davies' decision that the document would go to 
the jury, arguing that the judge had instructed the panel that the 
controversial report only applied to former Police Chief Daryl F. Gates, who no 
longer is a defendant in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission investigated the Police Department after King's March 3, 1991, 
beating and found evidence of brutality and racism within its ranks. It also 
concluded that the department needed to make management changes. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that Gates was out of the case, defense attorneys argued, the report 
should not be used against the six remaining current and former officers. But 
Davies denied the request, saying the defense opened the door for the report by 
arguing that police policies and guidelines were partly responsible for the 
beating. 
</P>
<P>
 "You people made it relevant by the nature of your defense," Davies said. "You 
created the hook on which we've hung the evidence."

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; COUNCIL 
LIMITS OVERTIME FOR TOP DWP EMPLOYEES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles City Council voted unanimously Friday to restrict overtime 
payments for the Department of Water and Power's top non-union representatives, 
a move that could save about $27 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Councilman Joel Wachs said, the DWP approved $55 million in 
overtime -- including that for the top executives. 
</P>
<P>
 The council approved a plan that would prohibit overtime compensation for 
unrepresented DWP employees who make more than $100,000 a year.  
</P>
<P>
 Wachs said overtime costs for the DWP have been six to seven times greater 
than in any other city department.  
</P>
<P>
 "This painted a picture of abuse and excessive expenditures during a time when 
the department is being asked to tighten its belt," Wachs said. 
</P>
<P>
 After striking DWP workers forced the council to offer a 9% salary boost, a 
city study found that nearly all the 477 employees earning more than $70,000 
applied for and received overtime payments averaging $4,500 a year.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LONG BEACH; JUDGE 
REFUSES TO BLOCK RULE ON SCHOOL UNIFORMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A federal judge refused Friday to block the Long Beach Unified School District 
from requiring nearly 58,000 elementary and junior high students to wear 
uniforms next fall, a move aimed at avoiding gang-related problems.  
</P>
<P>
 U.S. District Judge Manuel Real denied a temporary restraining order sought by 
parents who opposed the requirement, but he set a hearing on the matter for 
June 20. 
</P>
<P>
 The district's board, however, will meet June 7 and is expected to adopt a 
list of methods aimed at ensuring compliance with the uniform requirement.  
</P>
<P>
 The district wants to assure that children who have to go through gang 
territory on the way to school do not become targets because of their attire, 
said attorney Catherine B. Hagen, who represents the district.  
</P>
<P>
 Hagen said uniforms are required in 10 Long Beach schools and they have helped 
reduce truancy and spur more involvement by parents. 
</P>
<P>
 The policy would affect 57,500 students in 56 elementary schools and 14 middle 
schools.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: BURBANK; COMIC CHARGED 
IN FIRE ON 'TONIGHT SHOW' SET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Comedian Bobcat Goldthwait was charged Friday with two misdemeanors that could 
result in jail terms for setting a chair ablaze on "The Tonight Show" set. 
</P>
<P>
 During a May 6 show, Goldthwait stood up in the middle of his interview with 
host Jay Leno and set his chair on fire.It was doused with cups of water. 
</P>
<P>
 "During that televised appearance Mr. Goldthwait lit a chair on fire using a 
lighter and lighter fluid. His actions created a significant danger of harm to 
himself and others," the Burbank city attorney's office said. 
</P>
<P>
 Goldthwait was charged with unlawfully causing a fire and possession of a 
flammable substance or device with the intent to burn property. Each count 
carries a maximum $1,000 fine and six months in jail. Arraignment was scheduled 
for June 23. 
</P>
<P>
 The comedian's lawyer, Peter Laird, said he had no comment on the charges. 
</P>
<P>
 The fire on the NBC-TV set was the latest talk-show stunt by Goldthwait, who 
on April 29 trashed the set of "The Arsenio Hall Show" and spray-painted 
graffiti on the backdrop to protest the show's cancellation.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES; 
COUNTY STARTS EXPERIMENTAL DRUG COURT PROGRAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A pilot project aimed at rehabilitating drug addicts and keeping them out of 
the "revolving door" of the criminal justice system officially began in 
Downtown Los Angeles on Friday.  
</P>
<P>
 "This is a program that will help give drug treatment to people who've been 
arrested for nonviolent crimes," said Los Angeles County Supervisor Ed Edelman. 
</P>
<P>
 The Drug Court pilot project began accepting candidates May 3 and 22 
defendants are now enrolled. Officials hope to accept about 200 during the 
first six months of the project. 
</P>
<P>
 The one-year diversion program is for defendants deemed eligible by 
prosecutors and court officials. It includes a blend of treatment and 
rehabilitation services, including individual and group counseling, 
acupuncture, 12-step programs, educational and vocational training and job 
placement.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: GLENDALE; ARMENIAN 
LEADERS CALL FOR END TO AURA OF HATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The scrawled pentagrams and swastikas on an Armenian group's building last 
week prompted leaders to appeal Friday for an end to what they feel is a 
growing aura of hate in Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
 "Surely tolerance is the foundation, the wellspring, of any healthy society," 
said Raffi Hamparian, governmental affairs director of the Armenian National 
Committee of America. "That society which is wrought with hate will eventually 
tear itself asunder."  
</P>
<P>
 Hamparian spoke at a news conference at St. Mary's Armenian Apostolic Church. 
He called on the Glendale City Council to condemn "the recent wave of 
anti-Armenian acts and to work to create a positive relationship between all of 
Glendale's citizenry."

CLINTON PLAN FOR HOMELESS COULD BE L.A. WINDFALL; FUNDING: ADMINISTRATION IS 
SEEKING TO DOUBLE FUNDING TO $1.7 BILLION AND ALLOCATE IT IN PROPORTION TO THE 
NUMBER OF NEEDY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TED ROHRLICH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration's plan of attack on homelessness, unveiled earlier 
this week, holds the promise of vastly increased federal funding to fight the 
problem in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 The projected windfall for Los Angeles, Orange, Ventura, San Bernardino and 
Riverside counties would come because the Administration is seeking to double 
overall funds to combat homelessness to $1.7 billion, as well as to change the 
way such funds are distributed. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration says it wants to assign money to areas in proportion to how 
many poor and unemployed people live there, rather than award them to the 
providers of services for the homeless who write the most persuasive grant 
proposals -- regardless of their area's needs. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a whole different theory," said Phillip Johnson, a spokesman for the 
Department of Housing and Urban Development. 
</P>
<P>
 According to figures released this week by the White House, local governments 
here could expect to receive $88 million next year to fight homelessness. 
Although that represents a substantial increase over current funding, the size 
of the increase could not be determined. 
</P>
<P>
 Administration officials released figures showing current levels of spending 
in the Southland to be $11 million a year, but admitted that the total did not 
include all funds. They said they were unable to provide a better estimate. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the uncertainty, local officials and homeless advocates say they are 
pleased and optimistic about the Administration's approach. 
</P>
<P>
 "It appears to mean at least a doubling -- if not more -- of the money that is 
directly targeted for homelessness by HUD to (L.A.) city and county," said Gene 
Boutillier, director of the Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority, a new 
government agency that will coordinate city and county homeless services. 
</P>
<P>
 Local governments in Los Angeles County would receive more than three-fourths 
of the funds targeted for the Southland, then hand them out to service 
providers in what federal officials hope will be a discerning, strategic 
manner. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our great strength (in Los Angeles) has been having lots of diverse 
organizations to address the problem," Boutillier said. "The natural weakness 
that goes with that has been chaos." 
</P>
<P>
 On any given night, advocates say, there are 43,000 to 77,000 homeless people 
in the county, said Ruth Schwartz, director of the nonprofit Shelter 
Partnership. 
</P>
<P>
 Considering the size of its homeless population, she said, "This region has 
really been shortchanged for years." 
</P>
<P>
 The new funds would be in addition to $20 million to $25 million that HUD has 
committed to Los Angeles over the next three years for a pilot project aimed at 
achieving Secretary Henry Cisneros' stated goal of reducing visible 
homelessness by one-third. 
</P>
<P>
 Plans for the pilot program are still being drafted by advocates and 
officials, and the proposal is not expected to be complete until mid-summer. 
</P>
<P>
 But some of those engaged in the work said this week that they hope to create 
a 60-square-mile target area, extending from the Eastside to Downtown and south 
to Willowbrook. 
</P>
<P>
 Key components of the developing plan are: 
</P>
<P>
 * More counseling of homeless people in encampments and on the street. 
</P>
<P>
 * Referral centers Downtown, along with satellite facilities in Pacoima, 
Glendale and the Westside, to steer the homeless to the most suitable services. 
</P>
<P>
 * Expansion of the current few dozen shelter beds for substance abusers who 
want to kick their habits. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Prevention funding" in the form of cash for families struggling to avoid 
evictions. 
</P>
<P>
 * Expansion of programs that offer a "continuum of care" from Downtown to the 
Eastside and South-Central Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 One program that is viewed as a model worth replicating by many homeless 
advocates is the Los Angeles Men's Place, which helps mentally ill homeless 
with a low-key, no-pressure, drop-in center, and short- and long-term housing.

DDT CLEANUP TURNS RESIDENTS INTO REFUGEES; SAFETY: FAMILIES MAY REMAIN IN A 
TORRANCE HOTEL UP TO SIX MONTHS WHILE TAINTED SOIL IS STUDIED AND REMOVED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 They are refugees from the DDT wars, these families encamped in a Torrance 
hotel since April, while backhoes and cleanup crews occupy their neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Day after day, they have heard of strange discoveries along their street, of 
white chunks of DDT being unearthed in two back yards -- chunks as large as 
golf balls, tennis balls, then bowling balls. 
</P>
<P>
 They wonder when, if ever, their lives will be normal again. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have to have control of my life," Dunia Ponce said Friday. "And I have lost 
control, totally."  
</P>
<P>
 Ponce, 33, like many of her neighbors, has been living in a suite in the 
Marriott Residence Inn in Torrance since April 26. 
</P>
<P>
 The residents of the small neighborhood just east of Torrance began fearing it 
would be unsafe to return to their homes next week as scheduled. Many expressed 
relief when federal officials announced Thursday that the families can remain 
in temporary housing for up to six months while the DDT contamination is 
studied further. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, they feel like hostages of the ever-spreading investigation and cleanup 
that has sent 90 people to hotels at federal expense. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Ponce wistfully described the two-bedroom home on West 204th Street that she 
bought three years ago, the remodeled bathroom, the new driveway, and the 
tomatoes, squash and roses in the garden. She told how she learned that federal 
testing had turned up DDT-laced soil across the street. The source of the 
contamination is still unknown. 
</P>
<P>
 "I bought my house, and I bought it in a waste dump," Ponce said bitterly. She 
thinks the DDT contamination is so severe that residents should be relocated 
permanently. 
</P>
<P>
 Some are heartened by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's comments 
Thursday that it would study the possibility of a permanent move. 
</P>
<P>
 But EPA officials hastened to add that such a step may be unnecessary -- and 
certainly unusual. Only once has the agency's four-state regional office 
permanently relocated neighbors of a Superfund site, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents of the working-class block of West 204th originally were to be 
relocated for only two weeks. But workers found buried white clumps containing 
about 760,000 parts per million of the banned pesticide. The maximum safe level 
is considered to be about 100 p.p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The clumps were scattered in fill dirt that went as deep as seven feet in one 
yard. While the EPA originally had planned to remove 500 cubic yards of tainted 
soil, it by now has carted away about 2,000 cubic yards. 
</P>
<P>
 The EPA plans extensive testing to determine how far the fill material extends 
and whether houses are sitting on top of it. The agency also is attempting to 
determine the source of the fill. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the street is near a former DDT manufacturing plant that is now a 
federal Superfund site, the EPA does not know if the buried DDT came from that 
plant. 
</P>
<P>
 Families can return home if they wish during the investigation, but they have 
been cautioned not to garden or to allow children to play in soil in their 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to go home as soon as I can," said Rosie Soto, 21, who complained that 
she is bored with hotel life and that her 9-month-old son misses his familiar 
crib. 
</P>
<P>
 Others acknowledge the frustrations of living out of a suitcase, of 
chauffeuring children across town to school, and of visiting their empty houses 
daily to water plants and collect the mail. But most say they will stay away 
from West 204th as long as they can. 
</P>
<P>
 Said resident Robin Hatch: "I don't call my house a home anymore. It's called 
the pits."

the circus a chance to see the show, museum officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Highlights of the show will include Miss Andrea, the hula-hooper, a dog act 
and comedy skits by circus clowns. 
</P>
<P>
 The museum is at 301 S. Euclid St. in La Habra. The circus will be in La Habra 
Monday through May 29 at the old Bullock's parking lot on Imperial Highway,

PRIEST WHO COLLECTS EPITAPHS WRITES HIS OWN PARTING SHOT; GRAVESTONES: HISTORY 
BUFF AND ARCHIVIST WHO LIKES TO EXPLORE CEMETERIES HAS ALREADY HAD A MARKER 
INSCRIBED. 
</P>

<P>
 It was distressing for an acquaintance to happen upon the gravestone of Msgr. 
Francis J. Weber, who, the last she knew, was alive and well and working at San 
Fernando Mission. 
</P>
<P>
 The grave marker on a grassy knoll at Holy Cross Cemetery in Culver City bears 
Weber's name and these data: 
</P>
<P>
 "Born 1933, Ordained 1959. Priest-Archivist-Historian." 
</P>
<P>
 The nun who telephoned Weber was pleasantly surprised to learn that he is 
alive, but she was confused.  
</P>
<P>
 "You didn't see a death date, did you?" Weber teased. 
</P>
<P>
 The wry denizen of San Fernando Mission insists he's not trying to learn what 
people really think of him before he dies. 
</P>
<P>
 He just wanted to write his own epitaph. 
</P>
<P>
 "Besides an obituary in the local newspaper, about the only monument left on 
planet Earth by the great majority of people is a flat, rectangular gravestone 
marking the location of their burial," Weber said. At 61, Weber, who celebrates 
Masses daily at the mission and writes a weekly column for the Los Angeles 
archdiocesan newspaper, hardly has one foot in the grave. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Ever since he worked summers as a gravedigger in Los Angeles to finance his 
education in the 1950s, Weber has been drawn to tombstones in older communities 
around the country and abroad. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can learn a lot about the history of an area just by reading the 
tombstones," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 As a hobby, Weber began collecting the more interesting epitaphs, especially 
those marking the decedent's passing with wit and whimsy. 
</P>
<P>
 Boot Hill in Tombstone, Ariz., is famous for its clever grave markers. One of 
Weber's favorites is: 
</P>
<P>
 Here lies Lester Moore.  
</P>
<P>
 Four slugs from a .44.  
</P>
<P>
 No Les. No Moore.  
</P>
<P>
 The cause of death inspired other epitaphs as well, Weber said. One stone in 
Schenectady, N.Y., said: He got a fish-bone in his throat, And then he sang an 
angel's note.  
</P>
<P>
 In Medway, Mass., an epitaph read: 
</P>
<P>
 Under this stone, this piece of clay  
</P>
<P>
 Lies Uncle Peter Daniels  
</P>
<P>
 Who too early in the month of May  
</P>
<P>
 Took off his winter flannels  
</P>
<P>
 Anne Hopewell was remembered thusly in Enosburg, Vt.: 
</P>
<P>
 Here lies the body of beloved Anna  
</P>
<P>
 to death by a fresh banana  
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't the fruit that laid her low  
</P>
<P>
 But the skin of the thing that made her go.  
</P>
<P>
 But the pronouncement on a gravestone could also give critics their final 
shot, Weber said. For instance, a granite slab in Hatfield, Mass., read: 
</P>
<P>
 Beneath this stone a lump of clay  
</P>
<P>
 Lies Arabella Young  
</P>
<P>
 Who on the 21st of May  
</P>
<P>
 Began to hold her tongue.  
</P>
<P>
 In the churchyard in Woolwich, England, Weber said, "is a very beautifully 
carved marker" with a crushing farewell: 
</P>
<P>
 Sacred to the memory of Major James Brush, Royal Artillery, who was killed by 
the accidental discharge of a pistol by his orderly, 14th April, 1831. Well 
done, good and faithful servant.  
</P>
<P>
 The comments sometimes pertained to the community as much as to the person in 
the grave, Weber said -- such as one he found in Aberdeen, Scotland: 
</P>
<P>
 Here lies the bones of Elizabeth Charlotte  
</P>
<P>
 Born a virgin, died a harlot  
</P>
<P>
 She was a virgin at seventeen  
</P>
<P>
 A remarkable thing in Aberdeen.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The priest said that today's smaller grave markers have made epitaphs a thing 
of the past. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't seen any epitaphs on tombstones that date within the last 50 or 60 
years," Weber said. "They list mostly the birth and death dates, and maybe the 
names of the mother and father." 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, he said, leaving the marker's wording to relatives or others can 
result in inaccurate or inappropriate inscriptions. 
</P>
<P>
 Weber, interviewed as he stood over his grave, admitted that his small marker 
has little room to squeeze in any more information. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody cares when you died," he said, perhaps letting modesty contradict his 
calling as an archivist-historian. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked what old-style epitaph he might chose if space permitted, Weber said he 
would probably quote Father Junipero Serra, the mission pioneer: 
</P>
<P>
 In California is my life and there,  
</P>
<P>
 God willing, I hope to die.  
</P>
<P>
 Sorry, father. Serra's quote doesn't match the whimsy of epitaphs you love so 
much. How about something on the order of: 
</P>
<P>
 Here lies a history-loving priest  
</P>
<P>
 Roamed graveyards often , to say the least  
</P>
<P>
 Wrote his own marker, hardly a wonder  
</P>
<P>
 Father gets last word while six feet under.

SOUTHERN BAPTISTS LEARN BIGGER IS NOT ALWAYS BETTER; RESEARCH: DRIVE TO 
CONSOLIDATE CREATED MID-SIZE CONGREGATIONS WHOSE MEMBERS GIVE LESS IN TIME AND 
MONEY THAN MEMBERS OF SMALLER 'HOUSE CHURCHES,' STUDY SHOWS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Earlier this century, Southern Baptists took over the South with their ability 
to start new congregations in rural areas too small for other denominations to 
bother with. 
</P>
<P>
 All it took was a few people and a lay preacher and they had a church. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the past 40 years, the denomination took a deliberate turn to larger 
churches. The smaller churches were closed and merged, and big churches with 
seminary-trained pastors became the trend. 
</P>
<P>
 What they have found is that bigger is not necessarily better, according to a 
new study in the Review of Religious Research. Increasing the size of 
congregations has brought with it a flood of mid-size congregations whose 
members give less in time and money than members of smaller congregations. 
</P>
<P>
 With the Southern Baptist Convention now at the top of the hill of Protestant 
denominations in terms of size, there is the beginning of a movement back to 
the "house churches" that first gave the organization its strength. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really only been in the last generation that we've created these large 
churches and our smaller churches became mid-sized churches," said the Rev. 
David Palmer, associate director of the convention's New Church Extension 
Division. "We made a fatal connection. We sold the idea to be a real church you 
had to have a full-time preacher." 
</P>
<P>
 In the Review of Religious Research, sociologist Roger Finke of Purdue 
University traces the subtle but dramatic transformation of the Southern 
Baptist Convention from a group of small, fiercely independent churches to a 
denomination larger than its mainline counterparts in average church size and 
increasingly run by professionally trained clergy. 
</P>
<P>
 The average size of a Southern Baptist church increased by only 30 members, 
from 85 to 115 during the first 75 years of the convention's history, 1845 to 
1920, Finke said. During the past 70 years, congregation size has more than 
tripled to nearly 400 members. 
</P>
<P>
 Compared to those in other Protestant churches, the changes have been 
particularly striking, Finke said. For example, until 1950 Southern Baptists 
averaged 255 members per church, less than the average of 277 members per 
church of Protestant denominations with more than 1 million members. By 1990, 
the other denominations had increased their church size to only 297, while the 
Southern Baptists increased to 396 members per church. 
</P>
<P>
 To run these larger churches, congregations became less dependent on local 
preachers who would have another job in town to support themselves, and 
increasingly turned to seminary-trained clergy. 
</P>
<P>
 Finke said it took nearly a century, until 1950, for Southern Baptist 
seminaries to furnish their first 10,000 graduates. Since 1950, convention 
seminaries have produced more than 60,000 graduates. 
</P>
<P>
 But as churches have been getting larger, researchers have found what early 
Southern Baptists knew all along: There is strength in small numbers. 
</P>
<P>
 In small groups, members are more accountable to one another and are able to 
maintain a high set of religious standards. Supportive social networks, fervent 
testimonials and a sense of belonging are but a few of the advantages of small 
religious groups, according to Finke. 
</P>
<P>
 The figures bear out a high level of commitment in small churches. Churches 
with fewer than 100 members have the highest rate of Sunday school enrollment: 
86% of congregants in churches with fewer than 50 members participate. In 
contrast, fewer than half the members in mid-sized churches are enrolled in 
Sunday school. 
</P>
<P>
 The changes have not gone unnoticed. "We're seeing an infant movement right 
now to start house churches," small congregations that meet in homes or public 
buildings and do not require a full-time pastor, Palmer said. 
</P>
<P>
 In California, Jonathan Campbell, a "church planter strategist" based in 
Riverside, helps nurture communities from as few as three to as many as 20 
people who meet in homes and apartment complexes.

CATHOLIC NUNS PRESS FOR MORE DECISION-MAKING POWER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Religious News Service 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Catholic nuns, preparing for a major Vatican meeting this fall on religious 
orders, have asked to be included in decision-making positions in the church. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 425 heads of women's religious orders responded to a survey about 
the October Synod of Bishops in Rome, the theme of which is religious life. 
</P>
<P>
 A summary of their responses was published in the latest bulletin of the 
International Union of Superiors General, a federation of the heads of women's 
religious orders. 
</P>
<P>
 "The synod is viewed as an ideal opportunity to explore avenues and Gospel 
reasons for full inclusion of consecrated women in decision-making roles, in 
reflection processes and in ecclesial ministries," the article said. 
</P>
<P>
 There are nearly 1 million Catholic nuns worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
 The article, written by Sister Marguerite Letorneau of the Montreal-based 
Sisters of Charity, or Gray Sisters, did not mention specifically the demand 
for ordination to the priesthood. 
</P>
<P>
 But the nuns are asking for more power in the church, and the October meeting 
promises to be a lively one. 
</P>
<P>
 "A first step might be the presence of qualified women religious in major 
positions of the Curia (the Vatican hierarchy)," Letorneau wrote. Although 
hundreds of women religious work at the Vatican, none hold major positions. 
</P>
<P>
 She also cited "a growing impatience with the persistent use of exclusive 
language" in the church. 
</P>
<P>
 The superiors charged that bishops frequently are insensitive to women's 
religious orders, which for decades have provided the bulk of low-cost teachers 
for Catholic schools worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
 "Emphasis tends to be placed on the utilitarian aspect rather than on the 
intrinsic value of the apostolic religious life," the article said. "In 
addition, the token salaries given to women religious render more acute the 
existing financial problems of institutes." 
</P>
<P>
 Although they have made a call for more power and participation in the church, 
the nuns also acknowledged an identity crisis among women's religious orders. 
</P>
<P>
 "Women religious seem to be searching for a place and recognition in the 
actual structure of the church," Letorneau wrote.

WOMAN KILLED BY EXPLOSIVE DEVICE BESIDE DESERT ROAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A woman looking for recyclables with her two young sons along a remote desert 
road in the Antelope Valley was killed Friday when she picked up or stepped on 
an explosive device, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 33-year-old woman, whose name was not immediately released, was killed 
instantly, according to Deputy Angie McLaughlin, a spokeswoman for the Los 
Angeles County Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
 The victim's 4-year-old son was injured in the blast and taken to Antelope 
Valley Hospital Medical Center in Lancaster, where he was listed in stable 
condition. His 10-year-old brother was not injured. 
</P>
<P>
 Homemade pipe bombs have been found in the Littlerock area of the valley where 
the explosion occurred, but McLaughlin said investigators were unsure what 
killed the woman. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was scavenging for cans and stuff with the two boys when suddenly she 
either picked up or just stepped on some unknown kind of explosive device," the 
deputy said. "We don't know how it got there or how long it has been there."

DREIFORT'S ARM GETTING A WORKOUT; DODGERS: RIGHT-HANDER IS CLOSING GAME AFTER 
GAME, BUT SOME SAY IT'S TOO MANY TOO SOON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSS NEWHAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Chan Ho Park, the one babe of summer, was sent to the minors for more work. 
</P>
<P>
 Darren Dreifort, the other, is getting plenty where he is. 
</P>
<P>
 Too much? 
</P>
<P>
 Some are already wondering. 
</P>
<P>
 At 22, acclimating to his first professional season while thrust into the 
do-or-die role of a major league closer while Todd Worrell remains on the 
disabled list, Dreifort was setting a record rookie pace by appearing in 19 of 
the Dodgers' first 39 games and working 23 innings. 
</P>
<P>
 If he should continue at this pace, not including the number of times he has 
warmed up and not been called on, he would appear in 78 games and pitch about 
94 innings. The 78 would equal the National League rookie record set by Tim 
Burke of the Montreal Expos in 1985. The major league record of 80 was set the 
next year by Mitch Williams, then of the Texas Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
 Numerical projections seldom become reality -- and in fact, he did not appear 
Wednesday, Thursday or Friday -- but there is conjecture that an arm projected 
for bullpen greatness could be significantly taxed before Dreifort has seen 
every National League city -- particularly after he blew a save opportunity 
against the Colorado Rockies Tuesday night only 24 hours after Manager Tom 
Lasorda inexplicably used him in the ninth inning of a game the Dodgers were 
leading, 9-2. 
</P>
<P>
 Dreifort, who had pitched in seven of the 10 games on the last trip, including 
three of the last four, breezed through his first assignment on this one but 
lacked similar location and stuff when brought back with the game on the line 
the next night, giving up hits to the only three batters he faced. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked about Dreifort's employment in the 9-2 game, Lasorda said that a closer 
is a closer regardless of the score, adding: "He's strong and can pitch two 
days in a row." Pitching coach Ron Perranoski said only that the decision was 
the manager's. 
</P>
<P>
 It's all a process of education for the pitcher fresh off the Wichita State 
campus, where Coach Gene Stephenson continues to chart his progress. Stephenson 
and the Shockers reached the College World Series in each of the three years 
that Dreifort served as designated hitter and middle reliever, playing in the 
championship game in 1991 and '93. Dreifort pitched in 30 of 78 games last 
year, working 101 2/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
 "College coaches have a reputation for riding a hot horse to death, but that's 
not the case at Wichita State," Stephenson said. "Our reputation among pro 
scouts is probably the best of any program in the country. 
</P>
<P>
 "Darren always got proper rest. We were always concerned with what could 
happen if he was overused. I told Tommy (Lasorda) when he was here that Darren 
would be successful in any role -- starting, middle relief or short man -- and 
I told him he doesn't have to worry about Darren getting beat up mentally as so 
many young relievers do because Darren understands the reality. He knows he 
can't be perfect every time and that if he does get beat, he knows the best 
thing for him is to get right back in the saddle. 
</P>
<P>
 "I mean, he's not facing anything now he can't overcome mentally. My only 
concern is with the physical aspect of sometimes pitching two or three games in 
a row. He didn't have to do that here because we don't play every day and he 
wasn't my closer. I pitched him in the middle. Sometimes two innings, sometimes 
seven. He often finished what he started, but he always got his rest." 
</P>
<P>
 Dreifort, of course, dismisses the concern. 
</P>
<P>
 What would you expect from a pitcher whose mental and emotional makeup draws 
as much praise as his darting and sinking fastball and who is such a team 
player that he always remembers to turn his soiled socks right side out before 
dumping them in the clubhouse hamper? 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm happy to get whatever innings I get," he said. "The fact that I pitched 
more than 100 in relief last year should be an indication I can handle it. The 
only problems I've ever had with my arm came at the start of a season because 
it was cold and it wasn't in shape yet. 
</P>
<P>
 "I mean, you have to develop a feel for your body, but every pitcher has to 
throw through stiffness and tightness at times. My attitude goes back to Little 
League and high school when your arm would be killing you from throwing so much 
and you'd ice it and go out and throw some more. You might not have a lot on 
the ball, but that would force you to concentrate more on the job. Those were 
the situations in which you learned how to pitch." 
</P>
<P>
 With Worrell sidelined and the Dodgers hoping for stability from a bullpen 
that has blown more saves -- nine -- than it has recorded -- seven -- Dreifort 
is experiencing another crash course, to use his own definition, in the 
toughest of classrooms, trying to take what he has worked on in the bullpen 
between his frequent appearances into critical game situations. 
</P>
<P>
 He is 0-2 with five saves and a 4.30 earned-run average. He has given up 29 
hits and 11 walks in 23 innings, striking out 19. He has blown four saves, but 
is yet to be hammered. "I'm the type of pitcher who is either going to live by 
the ground ball or die by it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes, however, a ground ball isn't good enough. A strikeout is frequently 
required in the high-wire world of the closer. Dreifort was summoned to a 
meeting with Lasorda and Perranoski in Los Angeles last week for a lecture on 
location and putting hitters away when ahead on the count. 
</P>
<P>
 "Darren has a major league presence," Perranoski said. "Win, lose or save, you 
can't tell the difference. With his temperament and ability, once he knows how 
to cut up a hitter, he's going to be a great one. It's a matter of refinement. 
We're working to develop a curveball to go with his sinking fastball and 
slider. We communicate every day and would never do anything detrimental to his 
career. We'll back off even at times when he says he's OK." 
</P>
<P>
 Worrell is expected back soon, which will ease some of Dreifort's force-fed 
burden, but not the long-range expectation. 
</P>
<P>
 Lasorda said: "We don't try to overuse anybody at any point in their careers. 
We've installed the young man in a very tough position, but we feel he has the 
makeup and ability to handle it. It's a question now of utilizing the ability 
in the right way. When he has the edge on a hitter, he has to learn how to chop 
him up. It's more location than anything, and it comes through experience and 
application." 
</P>
<P>
 Roger McDowell can take Dreifort on a tour of New York, but he is alone on the 
mound. Stephenson, on the phone from Wichita, said Dreifort will be fine, that 
it is only a matter of adjusting (1) to hitters far more selective than those 
he was pitching to only a year ago and (2) to "the postage stamp strike zone in 
the majors that makes it very difficult to get a called strike and forces a 
pitcher to throw fatter pitches than he'd like." 
</P>
<P>
 Stephenson added: "Darren has to learn to live with that zone and he will. He 
not only has great physical and mental makeup, but he has the best movement on 
his fastball of any reliever I've ever seen. He also has a great slider that 
moves down and in on left-handers. He gets left-handers out big time. I've 
wondered why he hasn't thrown it more with the Dodgers, but Tommy and those 
people know what they're doing." 
</P>
<P>
 Did the Dodgers know what they were doing when they made Dreifort their No. 1 
draft choice last June? 
</P>
<P>
 His rookie workload is an indication of how strongly they believe it.

WORLD CUP '94: 27 DAYS AND COUNTING; SUPER STOPPER; WHEN CHIPS ARE DOWN, 
GOYCOCHEA IS ARGENTINA'S ACE IN THE GOAL

 If not for the bad luck of one Argentine goalkeeper, and the bad attitude of 
another, it is doubtful the world would ever have heard of Sergio Javier 
Goycochea. 
</P>
<P>
 Nery Pumpido was in the nets in 1986 when Argentina won the World Cup in 
Mexico. His understudy that year was Luis Islas. 
</P>
<P>
 Four years later, when Argentine Coach Carlos Salvador Bilardo chose his three 
goalkeepers for Italia '90, Pumpido was his first choice, Islas his second and 
Goycochea third. 
</P>
<P>
 But Islas refused to play another World Cup as No. 2 and was dropped from the 
team. That moved Goycochea up a notch. If anything happened to Pumpido, he 
would become Argentina's last line of defense. 
</P>
<P>
 Pumpido's luck had never been good. In one bizarre accident, he caught his 
wedding ring on a hook holding the netting to the crossbar and nearly lost the 
finger. Luckily, surgeons were able to repair the damage and save his career. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, in Argentina's opening game in the 1990 World Cup, against Cameroon in 
Milan, Pumpido fumbled a header by striker Francois Omam-Biyik and the ball 
trickled across the line to give the African team a 1-0 victory and a momentous 
upset over the defending world champion. 
</P>
<P>
 Even before Argentina had made its way down to Naples to play the Soviet Union 
in its next match, Bilardo was having second thoughts about Pumpido. But he was 
spared making a decision. 
</P>
<P>
 Twelve minutes into the game with the Soviets, Pumpido's bad luck caught up 
with him again. He collided with teammate Julio Olarticoechea and suffered a 
broken leg. 
</P>
<P>
 As Pumpido was being carried from the field on a stretcher, Bilardo escorted 
Goycochea onto the field and into the history books. 
</P>
<P>
 For the next four years, Goycochea built a reputation as a goalkeeper of 
extraordinary ability, one who exhibited a priceless gift for saving penalty 
kicks. 
</P>
<P>
 The nicknames came fast and furious. Goycochea became the "Prince of 
Penalties" and the "King of the Shootout." To his teammates, however, he 
remained simply "Goyco." 
</P>
<P>
 A penalty kick in soccer is virtually an automatic goal. The ball is placed on 
the penalty spot, 12 yards from the net. The goalkeeper is positioned on his 
line and is not allowed to move until the ball is struck. About 90% of all 
penalty kicks result in goals. 
</P>
<P>
 But not against Goycochea. 
</P>
<P>
 "Saving penalties has very little to do with luck, more to do with intuition," 
he said. "A goalkeeper can do one of three things: dive left, dive right or 
stay in place. Often, you look into the eye of the penalty-taker to try to find 
a clue. That's what I do." 
</P>
<P>
 World Cup '90 in Italy made Goycochea a hero in Argentina and a household name 
in the rest of the soccer world. The Copa America, or South American 
Championship, tournaments of 1991 in Chile and 1993 in Ecuador established his 
place in the history of the game. 
</P>
<P>
 It all began in Naples. But it as easily could have ended there, too. 
</P>
<P>
 Goycochea had not been on the field for more than a minute against the Soviets 
when a header by Oleg Kuznetsov caught him out of position. But as misfortune 
had followed Pumpido, so good luck followed Goycochea. 
</P>
<P>
 For whatever improbable reason, Diego Maradona was back on defense, positioned 
in front of the net. Maradona stuck out a hand and deflected Kuznetsov's shot. 
The crowd saw the violation, but Swedish referee Erik Fredricksson missed it. 
The hand ball went unpunished and all of Argentina breathed again. 
</P>
<P>
 The Soviets were beaten, 2-0, and a 1-1 tie against Romania in the final 
first-round game earned the Argentines a place in the second round. That's 
where the Goycochea legend began. 
</P>
<P>
 Playing in Turin's magnificent Stadium of the Alps, Argentina was subjected to 
wave after wave of Brazilian attacks. Shots flew goalward from all angles. Some 
went wide, some flew high, some hit the posts or crossbar and some were saved 
by Goycochea. 
</P>
<P>
 Suddenly, a brilliant pass from Maradona produced a goal by Claudio Caniggia 
and Brazil had been beaten, 1-0. Goycochea had a shutout and Argentina was in 
the quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
 Yugoslavia was next. The score was 0-0 after 90 minutes and unchanged after 
120. That brought up the best-of-five penalty shootout. Yugoslavia missed its 
first attempt and Goycochea saved the fourth. Maradona missed for Argentina, 
which led, 3-2, when Faruhk Hadzibegic stepped up to take Yugoslavia's last 
kick. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feinted to dive right and threw myself back to the left," Goycochea said. 
"He hit the ball well, but not so powerfully. I can't really remember what 
happened after that. It's all a blur. I just started running like a madman. I 
remember Diego (Maradona) shouting: 'You're a genius! A genius!' Then it was as 
if the world fell in." 
</P>
<P>
 Hailed as an immediate hero, not only in his native town of Lima, about 60 
miles from Buenos Aires, but throughout Argentina, Goycochea proved in the next 
game that it had not been a fluke. 
</P>
<P>
 Playing Italy, the World Cup host, in the semifinal in Naples, Argentina again 
forced a tie, this time 1-1 after overtime, and the match went to penalty 
kicks. 
</P>
<P>
 The Argentines made their first four. Flinging himself to his left each time, 
Goycochea produced two splendid saves against Roberto Donadoni and Aldo Serena, 
and Argentina won the shootout, 4-3, advancing to the final and reducing all of 
Italy to tears. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Argentine dream ended in Rome. A superbly struck penalty kick by 
Andreas Brehme barely eluded Goycochea's outstretched fingers and flashed 
inside the left post. The World Cup was over. West Germany had won, 1-0. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, Goycochea has, if anything, enhanced his reputation. Coming into 
World Cup '94, he has yet to be beaten in a penalty shootout and has saved a 
remarkable eight penalty kicks for the national team. 
</P>
<P>
 Blessed with excellent reflexes and cat-like quickness, he adds to the mix a 
calmness and confidence that both settles his teammates and unnerves the 
opposition. 
</P>
<P>
 "People started suggesting (in Italia '90) that I had studied every player's 
penalty technique," he told London's World Soccer magazine. "That's all wrong. 
I didn't do any homework at all. 
</P>
<P>
 "On a penalty, a goalkeeper has nothing to lose and everything to gain. If he 
saves, he's a hero. If the opponent scores, then he's only doing his duty. If 
all five shots go past you, it's no big deal. So I didn't have any problems 
with nerves." 
</P>
<P>
 Goycochea made one of his greatest penalty saves in the Copa America 
tournament in Ecuador last summer. Again, Brazil was the opponent and, again, 
the Brazilians had run the Argentines ragged in the quarterfinal game in 
Guayaquil. But Goycochea held Brazil to a single goal and, after Argentina had 
tied the score late in the second half, the match ended up in penalty kicks. 
</P>
<P>
 The outcome was almost a foregone conclusion. Argentina won, 6-5, after 
Goycochea had denied Boiadeiro with a stunning save that he considers his best 
to date. 
</P>
<P>
 "The most emotional shootout was against Italy (in 1990) because it was a 
World Cup and it meant we reached the final," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "But the Brazilian players are the most difficult (to save against), at least 
on paper. They have the best technique and, with a slight movement, they can 
change the direction (of the shot)." 
</P>
<P>
 Goycochea's penalty kick heroics against Brazil were followed by another saved 
penalty in a shootout against Colombia in the Copa America semifinal, and 
Argentina went on to retain its South American title, beating Mexico in the 
championship match. 
</P>
<P>
 Surprisingly, Goycochea's success with the national team has not earned him a 
spot with a large European club, and he has tended to roam about since Italia 
'90. He has played for Brest in France and for Cerro Porteno and Olimpia in 
Paraguay, before returning to home to lead River Plate to its most recent 
Argentine championship. 
</P>
<P>
 Even then, Goycochea's form has been inconsistent, and he was dropped for one 
game by River Plate's 1978 World Cup-winning coach, Daniel Passarella. 
Goycochea dismissed the incident as irrelevant. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've suffered worse moments than this in my career, and I'm not going to give 
in now," he said, later adding, "it did not bother me in the slightest. It was 
only for one game. River Plate went on to win the championship." 
</P>
<P>
 Argentina's humiliating 5-0 loss to Colombia in World Cup qualifying in Buenos 
Aires last year is similarly discounted by Goycochea. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was an accident that can happen to anyone," he said. "It's in the past, 
and now we are looking ahead." 
</P>
<P>
 The future arrives next month in the shape of Nigeria, Greece and Bulgaria, 
Argentina's first three World Cup opponents. 
</P>
<P>
 But Bilardo is not worried. If it comes to a shootout, the coach believes he 
has the best weapon. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think it is a lottery," Bilardo said. "It depends on the players you 
have . . . and the goalkeeper." 
</P>
<P>
 Argentina, he believes, is in safe hands. Player Profile

WHITTINGHAM HOPING COLT WILL DELIVER; PREAKNESS: TRAINER WILL SEND LIGHTLY 
RACED NUMEROUS AGAINST GO FOR GIN, EIGHT OTHERS IN THE SECOND LEG OF THE TRIPLE 
CROWN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The U.S. Postal Service made Charlie Whittingham an honorary postmaster for a 
day Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 But Whittingham collects stakes winners, not stamps. "If you need a fast 
horse, I might lend you Numerous for some quick delivery," the 81-year-old Hall 
of Fame trainer said in accepting the honor. 
</P>
<P>
 Whittingham is hoping that Numerous will give him and jockey Pat Valenzuela an 
express trip and leave his stamp on today's Preakness at Pimlico. 
</P>
<P>
 Go For Gin, the Kentucky Derby winner, is expected to go off favored in the 
middle race of the Triple Crown, but support has been building all week here 
for Numerous, as it did for Whittingham's Strodes Creek before the Kentucky 
Derby two weeks ago. Strodes Creek had made only four starts before the Derby, 
not much seasoning for a 3-year-old being asked to run 1 1/4 miles, but Go For 
Gin was the only horse that stood between Strodes Creek and a Derby victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Strodes Creek is also at Pimlico, being readied for the Belmont Stakes in 
three weeks, leaving Numerous, who has had a week's more rest than the Derby 
horses, to carry his trainer's hopes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he'll run very well," the reticent Whittingham said. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Nick Zito, who trains Go For Gin: "I think Numerous is the horse we have 
to beat. He's well bred. . . . That's why he cost $1.7 million as a yearling. 
What a lot of people overlook is that he was fourth in the Santa Anita Derby, 
even though he blew a shoe in the race. And the Derby Trial is a good prep for 
the Preakness. 
</P>
<P>
 "A couple of years ago, Alydeed won the Derby Trial and came to Pimlico, and 
he was all anybody talked about. And he almost won the race." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, Pine Bluff had to work hard through the Pimlico stretch to outfinish 
Alydeed by three-quarters of a length. 
</P>
<P>
 Numerous' Derby Trial was only his sixth race and, like Strodes Creek, the son 
of Mr. Prospector and grandson of Nijinsky II has never won a stake. His only 
victory before the Trial was in a maiden race at Santa Anita in November. 
</P>
<P>
 So why was Numerous listed at 6-1, the co-third choice, on the Preakness' 
morning line? History. Whittingham has come here with Ferdinand, second in 
1986, and Sunday Silence, a winner in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 The other day, ABC's Jim McKay stopped at the barn of Henry Clark, the 
90-year-old trainer whose Linkage ran second to Aloma's Ruler in the 1982 
Preakness. 
</P>
<P>
 "Henry's a man of few words," McKay said. "All he said was, 'I like Charlie.' 
" 
</P>
<P>
 Told of Clark's assessment, Whittingham said: "We old fellas have got to stick 
together." 
</P>
<P>
 Whittingham's Preakness history is colorful. His only starters before 
Ferdinand and Sunday Silence were Gone Fishin', third in 1958, and Divine 
Comedy, fourth in 1960. 
</P>
<P>
 Whittingham had never been to Baltimore before the 1958 Preakness. After 
bedding down Gone Fishin', the trainer and his veterinarian, Jock Jocoy, went 
to one of the city's many good crab restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
 Sitting at his table, Whittingham noticed a man at the bar watching him and 
Jocoy throughout dinner. Finally, after they had finished eating, Whittingham 
stormed over to the bar. With one punch, he knocked the man off his stool. He 
and Jocoy then marched out. 
</P>
<P>
 The next morning at Pimlico, Whittingham noticed that the man he punched was 
in the barn area. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who is that?" he asked one of the locals. Whittingham was told that the man 
with the sore jaw was a member of the Maryland State Racing Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 The anecdote appears in an autobiographical manuscript that Jocoy has written. 
</P>
<P>
 Whittingham confirmed the incident, then added: "Doc left something out. When 
the guy was on the floor, I ripped off his necktie." 
</P>
<P>
 Whittingham will leave a different impression if Numerous wins from the 
outside post today. A horse breaking from that position hasn't won the 
Preakness since Aloma's Ruler, who led wire to wire in a seven-horse field in 
1982. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Whittingham nor trainer Wayne Lukas, whose Tabasco Cat will break from 
the inside, is happy with his post. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I was picking, I wouldn't pick No. 10," Whittingham said. "But I'm not 
picking, I'm getting. There's nothing you can do about the post position. It's 
not as bad as being on the rail. If we were down there, we might get shut off." 
</P>
<P>
 Valenzuela, who rode Sunday Silence to a narrow victory over Easy Goer in one 
of the most exciting runnings of the Preakness, has the assignment on Numerous 
because Eddie Delahoussaye has a virus. Valenzuela had been scheduled to ride 
Numerous in the San Felipe Stakes at Santa Anita on March 20, but Whittingham 
scratched the colt because of a muddy track. Chris McCarron, who rode Numerous 
to victory in the Derby Trial, will ride Go For Gin.

CAR HAS NO GENDER; LYN ST. JAMES, WHO ASKS NO QUARTER AND GIVES NONE AS THE 
ONLY WOMAN IN THE INDY 500 FIELD, WANTS TO BE JUDGED BY RESULTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHAV GLICK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The second row of this year's Indianapolis 500 field is one of the most 
intriguing in the race's 78 years. 
</P>
<P>
 It has a rookie from Canada, Jacques Villeneuve, whose father, Gilles, was his 
country's greatest driving hero when he was killed in a Formula One race. 
Villeneuve, who was only 11 when his father died, is the fastest rookie ever 
with a qualifying speed of 226.259 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
 It has Michael Andretti, the 1991 Indy car champion who missed last year's 500 
while running Formula One, a series in which he did poorly. He is back in Indy 
cars and, as if to affirm his return, won the season opener in Australia. 
</P>
<P>
 And, it has Lyn St. James, a 47-year-old woman who has not driven in a race of 
any kind since last August. 
</P>
<P>
 What makes this threesome so unusual is the three drivers in the row behind 
them -- a Hall of Fame lineup including 1992 Formula One champion Nigel Mansell 
and former 500 winners Arie Luyendyk and Mario Andretti. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a strange place," former winner Bobby Rahal said of the 
circumstances. "As I've said to a number of people, and I don't mean to pick on 
Lyn by example -- she did a wonderful job here last week -- but to (have her) 
out-qualify Nigel Mansell in the factory Lola, I mean, that says something 
about the fact that anything can happen." 
</P>
<P>
 St. James would agree, at least in part. 
</P>
<P>
 She arrived here two weeks ago to drive an untested car for owner Dick Simon. 
She had a rookie crew chief with no crew and minimal sponsorship, despite 
having been in the last two Indy 500s. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's mystifying, isn't it?" she mused. "We were at a severe disadvantage from 
the start, yet everything went our way. The first lap I had in the car (a 1994 
Lola-Ford Cosworth) was the day the track opened. 
</P>
<P>
 "After the operation on my elbow (to relieve a condition not related to 
racing), two days after the Michigan race (last Aug. 1), I was in a race car 
only twice until I got here. I did three laps at Putnam Park in Indianapolis in 
December to get a visual feel for the car, and I did 51 laps here at the 
Speedway on April 2 in the '92 car. That was it." 
</P>
<P>
 After driving in only six races last year before her sponsor pulled the plug, 
St. James was able to find support this year for only one race -- this one. 
</P>
<P>
 "Money is so tight that even if I won the 500 -- you know, anyone in the first 
three rows can win a race like this -- I don't think it would impact them to 
furnish me any more support," she said. "I ran well at Michigan last year and 
look what happened." 
</P>
<P>
 St. James set a women's closed-course record of 224.208 m.p.h. when she 
qualified at Michigan, but it was her last race. 
</P>
<P>
 For a crew chief this year, she picked an old family friend, Emery Donaldson, 
who had worked with her when she started out in Sports Car Club of America 
races in Florida in the '70s. 
</P>
<P>
 "Emery worked for my (first) husband and was like one of the family," she 
said. "He worked his way up the ranks in racing, and when I heard he was 
available, I gave him a call. He had always wanted to do Indy, and it helps 
when you have someone around you that you've known for 20 years." 
</P>
<P>
 Donaldson put together a crew less than two weeks ago, working with Simon, who 
has put five cars in the 500 two years in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dick is like a piece of gold," St. James said of the man who coached her 
through her first 500 qualifying two years ago when she was rookie of the year. 
"On the racetrack, he lets Emery do the talking to me, but he still has that 
innate ability to be there when I need him. Two years ago, every time I came 
in, that bald head was in my cockpit. He still listens to all the dialogue 
(between St. James and Donaldson) on the earphones. I don't know how he does 
it, with all the drivers he has." 
</P>
<P>
 Others driving for Simon here include Raul Boesel, who is in the middle of the 
front row; Hiro Matsushita and rookies Dennis Vitolo and Hideshi Matsuda. Simon 
is also helping prepare Marco Greco and Tero Palmroth for qualifying attempts 
this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 St. James credits Human Performance International, a mind- and body-testing 
organization based in her hometown of Daytona Beach, Fla., for keeping her fit 
mentally and physically for driving an 800 horsepower race car at 200 m.p.h. 
for 500 miles. 
</P>
<P>
 "For me, it made the difference," she said of her training. "I just wish I'd 
had something like that years ago. It would have made me a better driver, much 
sooner. It's something every race driver should go through. Nigel Mansell, (the 
late) Ayrton Senna, Emerson Fittipaldi and Al Unser Jr. are among those who 
have taken their course, and all of them said it was a help. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the big things is getting you to visualize driving at speed. I mean 
all the bumps and curves and surprises, everything that happens during a lap. 
Almost as soon as I got back in the car, it all came back to me, because I had 
been visualizing it in my thoughts." 
</P>
<P>
 Her four laps during qualifying last Saturday were uncommonly consistent. She 
varied only 0.038 seconds in lap times. 
</P>
<P>
 "I did six laps visually for every lap I ran, and I didn't screw up a single 
corner," she said. "I can't wait to get my hands on a tape of my qualifying and 
replay those four laps over and over. I guarantee you it will be worth every 
horrible day I've ever had. It was as close to perfection as I can achieve." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite her performance, she knows there are some who criticize a woman 
driving in the Indy 500. 
</P>
<P>
 "Auto racing is genderless," she said. "The car doesn't know the difference, 
and no one can even see that it's a woman driving. No one judges me by my smile 
or personality, but by my results." 
</P>
<P>
 And what of the future, 1995 and beyond? 
</P>
<P>
 "I want a full season in Indy cars next year," she said. "I haven't peaked 
yet."

BOXING / TIM KAWAKAMI; DE LA HOYA'S TRAINER WELCOMES SECOND CHANCE TO PROVE 
HIMSELF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM KAWAKAMI 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Robert Alcazar knows there are hundreds who believe that they, not Alcazar, 
should be training Oscar De La Hoya. 
</P>
<P>
 How does he know? As he works with De La Hoya for his fight next Friday 
against Giorgio Campanella at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas, Alcazar hears their 
voices, reads their comments, fights off their attempts to cut into the De La 
Hoya action. 
</P>
<P>
 If De La Hoya has a bad day, Alcazar is blamed. If De La Hoya takes eight 
rounds instead of two to brush aside a journeyman, Alcazar hears about it. If 
De La Hoya hasn't trampled the whole junior-lightweight and lightweight 
divisions at 21, Alcazar gets the heat. 
</P>
<P>
 Alcazar, a former boxer who joined De La Hoya after he worked at the same 
factory as De La Hoya's father and had never trained a major fighter before, is 
not experienced enough to work with someone so talented, the would-be-trainers 
argue. 
</P>
<P>
 They point to his quiet style in the gym as proof that Alcazar was fine 
working with De La Hoya on the way to the 1992 Olympic Games, but is 
overmatched at the championship level. 
</P>
<P>
 They note De La Hoya's occasionally awkward performance in knocking out Jimmi 
Bredahl in 10 rounds last March for the World Boxing Organization title and say 
Alcazar will guide De La Hoya into mediocrity, that he is no Emanuel Steward or 
Lou Duva or Eddie Futch. 
</P>
<P>
 Alcazar, proud of his pupil and of his work with him, acknowledges being 
frustrated by the constant criticism. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, they're going to point at me and they're going to blame me," Alcazar 
says. "But that's my challenge, I know. 
</P>
<P>
 "People say he should have somebody with more experience. Well, I ask myself 
right now, where were they all before when we really needed some help? Where 
were they? Why didn't they show up? 
</P>
<P>
 "Now that the cake is on the table, everybody wants a piece. That's the truth. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't have the kind of experience like those types claim to have, but how 
many of them have won a gold medal together and then won a world title 
together? I don't see them winning these titles. We worked for it, only him and 
myself." 
</P>
<P>
 De La Hoya, for his part, says he enjoys working with Alcazar, who has been 
his main trainer since De La Hoya was about 15. And the 21-year-old fighter 
stood up for Alcazar when former managers Steve Nelson and Bob Mittleman added 
Carlos Ortiz to his corner against Alcazar's wishes. 
</P>
<P>
 But De La Hoya adds that he probably will bring in someone with broader 
experience to assist Alcazar. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a good trainer," De La Hoya says. "He suits my style and he adds on to 
my style. He doesn't take away anything. 
</P>
<P>
 "When people say I have to bring in somebody else, it's no problem. I probably 
will in the future. But it has to be somebody suitable for my style. Robert has 
no problem bringing somebody in and helping us out, somebody more experienced, 
maybe like an Alexis Arguello, somebody who has my style." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the addition -- and then firing -- of Ortiz was instigated by 
Alcazar, and although it led to the subsequent firing of Nelson and Mittleman, 
Alcazar says he would welcome someone like Arguello in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 'It doesn't bother me at all," Alcazar says. "What bothers me is when I know 
it's not the right person. There are very few professionals out there. The 
majority, especially the ones who have a name already, those people want money. 
They don't care about the fighter. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are just snakes in there to make money, to lie to the fighters. They 
have the ability to talk, to convince the fighter. That's all it's about." 
</P>
<P>
 After the Bredahl bout, some in boxing criticized Alcazar's game plan and 
questioned why De La Hoya hadn't cut off Bredahl's running with body shots. 
</P>
<P>
 Alcazar concedes some of those points. In preparation for the more aggressive 
Campanella, De La Hoya has been working to the body, Alcazar says, and for the 
first time has been using the heavy bag to sharpen his hooks to the ribs. 
</P>
<P>
 The trainer adds that De La Hoya has had only 12 bouts, is undefeated and 
hasn't damaged his future a bit. And a huge future in the lightweight, 
junior-welterweight, welterweight and perhaps even middleweight divisions is 
still planned. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they make a mistake -- they try to compare him with the great ones 
already," Alcazar says. "He's what, 14 months a professional? Give us two or 
three years and we might see exactly where we're going . . . and exactly what 
type of professional fighter we're going to be. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Muhammad) Ali wasn't perfect. (Mike) Tyson took hits. But we're going to 
continue. The main thing, we want to see him progress between fights. We just 
need time." 
</P>
<P>
 For now, Alcazar finds contentment in the quieter work he does with 
featherweight Robert Garcia and junior-lightweight Pepe Reilly, a 1992 Olympic 
teammate of De La Hoya's who turned to Alcazar after a loss early in his 
professional career. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Having them) means a lot to me because I have the opportunity to prove 
myself," Alcazar said. "I don't have to prove anything to myself. These two new 
fighters, to have them working with me, I can have the opportunity to have two 
more world champions. And I'm going to prove that pretty soon." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The day and a half that Ortiz worked with De La Hoya were clearly the most 
tension-filled moments of the Alcazar-De La Hoya relationship, with the clear 
possibility that Alcazar could be forced out. 
</P>
<P>
 But the experience, and the ensuing tumult when De La Hoya fired his managers, 
apparently convinced De La Hoya that Alcazar should continue to be his most 
trusted boxing adviser in a close group that also includes De La Hoya's father, 
Joe, and his brother, Joe Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 Alcazar describes himself now as "more than a trainer, more than a manager, 
more than a father," to De La Hoya, but only on fight issues. "We are 
professionals," he says. "We work, we go home, and we do not party together. We 
respect each other." 
</P>
<P>
 During the Ortiz experiment, at least tacitly approved by De La Hoya, Alcazar 
was temporarily on the outside. 
</P>
<P>
 "When Ortiz came in, I told him, 'Oscar, look at this trainer's face, that's 
the kind of face you're going to have in no longer than one year,' " Alcazar 
says, adding that Ortiz, known as a brawler in his fighting days, had a face 
thick with old wounds. "And the first day he worked under Ortiz's orders, Oscar 
got the biggest beating of his life in the gym. 
</P>
<P>
 "After the workout, I asked Oscar, again, 'Look at (Ortiz's) face.' And I said 
to Oscar, 'Look at your face. You're bleeding all over your face.' 
</P>
<P>
 "You know what he did? He picked up his gloves and threw them away and walked 
out of the gym. He picked up the phone and he decided to fire the trainer and 
the managers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never should have let (Ortiz) walk into the gym to work with Oscar. Out of 
respect to our managers at that time, I decided to let him show us what he can 
do for us. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's history now. There's no more Carlos Ortiz, but who knows? There are a 
lot of snakes around who will try to make the money. Nobody knows what's going 
to happen tomorrow." 
</P>

RAHAL CAN WIN BY LOSING IN INDIANAPOLIS TRIALS; AUTO RACING: HE HAS A FASTER 
CAR READY TO DRIVE IF HIS SLOWER CAR IS BUMPED FROM THE FIELD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Bobby Rahal might be the first driver in Indy 500 history to hope he gets 
bumped from the field. 
</P>
<P>
 Three positions for the May 29 race remain to be filled today when qualifying 
trials resume at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway. Once 33 cars are qualified, 
the slowest cars may be bumped by non-qualified cars that are faster today and 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Rahal and teammate Mike Groff, in Honda-powered Lolas, are the two slowest 
among the 30 already qualified and are the most vulnerable to bumping. Rahal 
wants his two team cars to be eliminated early so he and Groff can get into 
contingency-plan Penske-Ilmors and get back in the race with competitive 
qualifying speeds. 
</P>
<P>
 The rub is, if the slow Hondas are not bumped, Rahal and Groff will have to 
drive them in the 500. 
</P>
<P>
 Once it became apparent that the Hondas were not likely to be competitive, 
Carl Hogan, Rahal's partner, contacted Roger Penske to buy two '93 
Ilmor-powered Penskes. Penske had entered them in the 500 in case his newer and 
more powerful Mercedes-Benz engines did not respond properly to testing -- 
which they did. 
</P>
<P>
 The car Rahal hopes to drive was Emerson Fittipaldi's backup in last year's 
500 and was raced by Paul Tracy at Mid-Ohio, where he led 20 laps. The 
Rahal-Hogan crew has refitted it for Rahal and installed a '94 Ilmor V-8 
engine. 
</P>
<P>
 Groff's Penske was used only for testing last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never want to find myself in the situation I was in last year, when I got 
bumped and couldn't get enough speed out of my other car to get back in the 
field," Rahal said. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, as the defending PPG Cup Indy car champion, he qualified with a 
chassis of his own making and was bumped. This year, back with an untried 
engine, he is in danger of the same fate, but this time he has the contingency 
plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the drivers expected to compete for the three remaining positions are 
John Paul Jr., Gary Bettenhausen, Geoff Brabham, Marco Greco and Buddy Lazier, 
all of whom have run 220 m.p.h. or faster the last two days.

PRIME TICKET AGREES ON SALE TO CABLE GIANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LISA DILLMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Prime Ticket network, which televises the games of five major professional 
sports teams in Southern California, reached an agreement Friday to be 
purchased by Denver-based cable giant Tele-Communications, Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 Terms were not disclosed, but sources familiar with the transaction said the 
purchase price is believed to be about $230 million.The deal -- subject to 
regulatory approval -- is expected to close in July. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Daniels, who started Prime Ticket with Jerry Buss in 1985, had acquired 
all but 16.5% by 1988. Buss, owner of the Lakers and the Forum, kept an 
interest of about 15%. 
</P>
<P>
 Employees were told of the sale at a staff meeting Friday afternoon with an 
announcement by Roger L. Werner Jr., company president and CEO. Werner is 
unsure of his future but remains under contract to Daniels. 
</P>
<P>
 Essentially, operations are expected to remain the same at Prime Ticket. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a good deal for Prime Ticket, its employees and viewers," Werner said. 
"TCI has deeper pockets to acquire more and better programming." 
</P>
<P>
 TCI, with 10.7 million customers, is the nation's largest cable-TV operator. 
TCI was in the news most recently when its $22-billion proposed merger with 
Bell Atlantic collapsed last winter. 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe Bill Daniels has built a tremendous business and organization in 
Prime Ticket, and we look forward to completing this acquisition as quickly as 
possible," John Malone, president and CEO of TCI, said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
 Prime Ticket serves 4 million cable subscribers in Southern California, 
Arizona, Nevada and Hawaii.

FISCHER, MEDEARIS TAKE ON RIVALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN ORTEGA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 High jumpers Jeremy Fischer of Camarillo High and Arthur Lloyd of Rialto 
Eisenhower and hurdlers Jason Medearis of Hart and Kenny Haslip of Pasadena 
Muir will renew their rivalries in today's Southern Section track and field 
championships at Long Beach Veterans Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Fischer, the national outdoor leader in the high jump with a mark of 7 feet 4 
inches, defeated Lloyd in the Arcadia Invitational (7-0 to 6-10) and Mt.San 
Antonio College Relays (7-3 to 7-2) last month. But he has cleared only 6-8 in 
winning the Mt. Carmel Invitational, Ventura County and Marmonte League 
championships since. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jeremy is one of those kids who jumps best when he has someone pushing him," 
Camarillo Coach Dennis Riedmiller said. 
</P>
<P>
 Quartz Hill's Jamaal Chase is favored in the Division I long jump. 
</P>
<P>
 Haslip, the defending state champion in the 300-meter intermediate hurdles, 
has defeated Medearis in three of four races this season.

WORLD CUP EXPANDS; TOURNAMENT GROWS TO 32 TEAMS IN '98 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Perhaps driven by political and financial considerations, soccer's governing 
body voted Friday to expand the World Cup to 32 teams from 24 starting with the 
1998 tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision, taken after FIFA President Joao Havelange promised an expanded 
tournament as part of his re-election campaign, was made in a unanimous vote by 
FIFA's executive committee.Twelve additional games promise to generate more 
revenue from the world's most-watched sporting event. 
</P>
<P>
 The tournament's first round will expand to eight groups of four, with the top 
two teams in each group advancing to the second round. Currently, there are six 
groups with the top two teams and the four best third-place teams advancing. 
</P>
<P>
 This summer's World Cup calls for 52 games in 31 days in nine U.S. cities. The 
decision to play the 1998 tournament in France was made two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "The competition will not take longer. We don't need more stadia," FIFA 
spokesman Andreas Herren said. 
</P>
<P>
 FIFA didn't decide on the allocation of teams, saying it probably would make 
the decision at the executive committee's meeting in December. 
</P>
<P>
 Europe has 13 of the 24 berths this year, with South American and Africa 
getting three each, and Asia and the North and Central American and Caribbean 
(CONCACAF) region getting two. South America won an additional berth contested 
by itself, CONCACAF and Oceania.

HUDLER DOESN'T WASTE OPPORTUNITY; BASEBALL: GIVEN A CHANCE TO TASTE LIFE IN THE 
MAJOR LEAGUES AGAIN, THE ANGEL IS HAVING A FEAST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN WEYLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rex Hudler hasn't had a lot of experience as a leadoff hitter, but new Angel 
Manager Marcel Lachemann penciled him into the No. 1 spot Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 This doesn't figure to be the beginning of a new order, but if Hudler 
continues to punish the ball the way he has lately, he may be vying with Tim 
Salmon and Chili Davis for the third and clean-up positions in the lineup. 
</P>
<P>
 These days, the 33-year-old who spent seven seasons as a role player in the 
National League and last year in Japan is definitely an RBI guy. 
</P>
<P>
 In his last eight at-bats, Hudler has six hits, including four doubles and a 
home run. Friday night, he scored three of the Angels' first four runs and 
drove in two during their 7-6 victory over Kansas City at Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Hudler led off the first inning with a double down the left-field line and 
scored on Salmon's sacrifice fly. In the second, he lined another shot into the 
corner in left to score Gary DiSarcina and later scored on Salmon's double. And 
in the fourth, he slammed a one-run homer that landed in left-field seats about 
400 feet from home plate. 
</P>
<P>
 "He did some damage," Lachemann said. "You can't discount the job Harold 
Reynolds has done (at second base), but there's certainly the temptation (to 
keep playing Hudler). We'll see how tempted I am when I make out the lineup 
card (today)." 
</P>
<P>
 Never mind the spot, Hudler is glad just to have a uniform.  
</P>
<P>
 "At my age, after being away in Japan for a year, I'm feel very fortunate just 
to have a job at all," Hudler said. "And believe me, I'm extremely thankful. 
Being on the bench is the next best thing to being in the lineup." 
</P>
<P>
 And for Hudler, anywhere in the lineup is as good as it gets. 
</P>
<P>
 "With the (Yakult) Swallows in Japan, I was the No. 2 hitter all spring until 
I missed a sign, one lousy sign, and you needed a computer to decipher their 
signs over there," he said. "After that, I hit eighth all year." 
</P>
<P>
 Hudler finished the year batting .300 with 14 homers and 64 RBIs as the 
Swallows beat the three-time champion Seibu Lions for the Japanese League 
Championship. The most significant statistic, however, might have been his 410 
at-bats.  
</P>
<P>
 "All those at-bats really made me a better hitter," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 Evidently. In his last four starts, he's hitting .625 and has boosted his 
season average to .408.  
</P>
<P>
 The Angels can thank San Francisco for Hudler, who was lured back and then 
released a week before the Angels signed him on March 28. 
</P>
<P>
 "I became a better all-around player in Japan," Hudler said. "If you made an 
error, they benched you for a game. That really makes you concentrate. And I 
went over there determined to do all the exercises they did, to dispel their 
notions about lazy Americans. And I ate the same food they do. 
</P>
<P>
 "By the time we went to the World Series, I acted, thought, even felt like a 
Japanese player. It has helped my self control and my focus." 
</P>
<P>
 Hudler, who originally planned to end his career in Japan, says he would 
definitely consider going back. If he continues to hit line drives like he has 
been recently, however, he'll have to go to Benihana to satisfy his cravings 
for Japanese food.

WHO'S IN THE FIRST? DON'T BET ON IT; HOLLYWOOD PARK: THE GELDINGS STALVOY AND 
JOHNNY MC APPARENTLY WERE SWITCHED AT BERTH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB MIESZERSKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An investigation is continuing into a bizarre case of mistaken horse identity 
at Hollywood Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Stalvoy, a 6-year-old gelding claimed for $20,000 after an April 9 victory at 
Santa Anita, was scheduled to make his first start for trainer Bill Spawr in 
Thursday's first race but was scratched about 30 minutes before post time. 
</P>
<P>
 Why? 
</P>
<P>
 The horse who came over from his stall in the Spawr stable to the receiving 
barn to be examined before he race was not Stalvoy. Instead, it was Johnny Mc, 
a 4-year-old gelding. 
</P>
<P>
 Stalvoy, meanwhile, was at trainer Bob Hess Jr.'s barn, where he had been 
since April 29, the night Hess thought he had claimed Johnny Mc for $25,000 for 
syndicate owner Inside Track Racing. 
</P>
<P>
 The geldings, who according to Hess have physical similarities, apparently 
were mixed up when they were shipped from Santa Anita to Hollywood Park on the 
same van April 12. 
</P>
<P>
 The theory is that Johnny Mc, who hadn't raced since last June 19, was 
delivered to Spawr's barn, and Stalvoy, who was supposed to go to Spawr, went 
to Craig Lewis, Johnny Mc's trainer. 
</P>
<P>
 On April 29, the gelding thought to be Johnny Mc finished fifth as the 3-1 
second choice in the fifth race, a six-furlong sprint for $25,000 claimers. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, it is believed that it was Stalvoy who ran fifth in that race, which 
would mean he was not identified correctly when he was brought to the receiving 
barn before the race. Horse identifier Dianne Piper was on vacation at the 
time. Her assistant is Sandy King. 
</P>
<P>
 Checking out the horses before the race to see if he wanted to put the claim 
in for Johnny Mc, Hess remarked to Steve Arthur, head of the Inside Track 
Racing syndicate, how much the horse looked like Stalvoy. Hess has twice been 
Stalvoy's trainer. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's weird and I feel like I've been in the Twilight Zone for the past three 
weeks," Hess said. "I said to my client that night that if I didn't know any 
better, I would say that was Stalvoy. He looked like him and walked like him 
and everything. But to think it was Stalvoy, I would have had to assume 
everybody was making a mistake. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was in Kentucky for a week, but when I came back I said again how much he 
looked like Stalvoy. When I lost Stalvoy (on a claim), his hair was slick and 
he was about 100 pounds heavier. This horse just looked like a skinny version 
of Stalvoy. But as he gained weight, he looked more and more like Stalvoy. 
</P>
<P>
 "My client and I saw a videotape of the paddock that night (April 29) and that 
definitely was Stalvoy. (Johnny Mc and Stalvoy) are very similar in color (both 
are bays) very similar in stature and they both have a star (marking on the 
forehead), but Johnny Mc has a noticeable white marking between his nostrils." 
</P>
<P>
 Pending the completion of the investigation, Johnny Mc remains in the Spawr 
barn and Hess has sent Stalvoy to Spawr as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just want to get this concluded as quickly as possible," Hess said. "We'll 
do whatever (the stewards) say. I don't think it's worth fighting over. They'll 
either give us the money back and we'll claim something else or they'll give us 
(Johnny Mc)." 
</P>
<P>
 Hollywood Park stewards Pete Pederson, Ingrid Fermin and Tom Ward will issue 
rulings after the investigation is completed.

COACH WANTS LITTLE MORE AFTER MATADORS WIN BIG; COLLEGE SOFTBALL: JONES AND 
MAUMAUSOLO HIT HOME RUNS AS NORTHRIDGE FINISHES EARLY, 8-0. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 While the lack of a consistent short game continues to unnerve Cal State 
Northridge softball Coach Gary Torgeson, the Matadors seem to get along just 
fine with the long ball. 
</P>
<P>
 Shannon Jones and Scia Maumausolo each contributed home runs to the Matadors' 
hit parade to fuel an 8-0 victory over Maine in five innings Friday in a 
first-round game of an NCAA Division I regional. 
</P>
<P>
 Maumausolo's two-run home run, which carried about 60 feet beyond the 
left-field fence 200 feet away, ended the game with one out in the fifth inning 
because of an eight-run mercy rule. 
</P>
<P>
 No Matador hitter is hotter than Maumausolo, a sophomore who has hit a home 
run in each of the last four games to raise her season total to seven. This 
home run, however, should be forever distinguished in Matador history. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's probably the longest one I've hit," Maumausolo said. 
</P>
<P>
 Not to mention anyone else at Northridge.

 Third-ranked Northridge (47-7) will face Cal State Fullerton (33-27) today at 
10 a.m. in the double-elimination tournament. Fullerton upset No. 10 
Washington, 2-1, in an earlier first-round game Friday. Washington committed 
four errors and stranded 11 baserunners. 
</P>
<P>
 The loser of the Northridge-Fullerton game will play the winner of the 
Washington-Maine game at 3 p.m. today. The championship game is Sunday at 12:30 
p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge wasted little time against unranked Maine, scoring in the first on 
a run-scoring double by Jen Fleming. Terri Pearson was hit by a pitch to lead 
off the inning. Fleming was given the bunt signal, but like many of her 
teammates lately, had trouble delivering. 
</P>
<P>
 After fouling off two bunt attempts, however, teammate Vicky Rios instructed 
Fleming to take a look at the pinched-in Maine outfielders. 
</P>
<P>
 "I looked at the outfield and the outfield is near the (infield) dirt and I'm 
like, 'What the hell are they doing?' " Fleming said. "I just punched it 
through the gap." 
</P>
<P>
 But Torgeson raised a few eyebrows when the next batter, Northridge's home-run 
record-holder Beth Calcante, was given the bunt signal when Fleming was already 
in scoring position at second. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm stubborn right now," Torgeson said. "I want the ball to be down. I want 
people in scoring position. You got Tamara (Ivie), Scia and (Shannon) Jones who 
are hitting the ball right now to hit them in. 
</P>
<P>
 "We gotta figure it out and they know that. I'm gonna continue with my game 
plan." 
</P>
<P>
 Calcante, who bats third and leads the team with 21 sacrifice bunts, 
delivered, but two batters later Maumausolo hit into a double play to end the 
threat. 
</P>
<P>
 The Matadors were quiet until the fourth. Ivie and Maumausolo started the 
inning with singles. Jones, after fouling off two pitches, ripped a home run to 
left-center to give Northridge a 4-0 lead. It was Jones' 12th home run of the 
season, tying Calcante's school record, set last season. 
</P>
<P>
 After a fly out by Jennifer Parker, Lee Ann Taylor walked and advanced to 
second on a sacrifice by Vicky Rios. Taylor later scored on a throwing error 
and Pearson, who reached base on the error, scored on a run-scoring single by 
Fleming to give the Matadors a 6-0 lead.  
</P>
<P>
 Junior Kathy Blake (16-5) pitched a two-hitter, struck out two and notched her 
12th shutout.

CRESCENTA VALLEY GETS LATE START, FINISHES CHANNEL ISLANDS

 Crescenta Valley High's baseball team didn't come alive until the seventh 
inning of Friday's Southern Section Division I playoff game against Channel 
Islands. 
</P>
<P>
 It made for a spectacular, 3-2 come-from-behind victory for the Falcons. 
</P>
<P>
 Crescenta Valley (17-5) went into the bottom of the seventh trailing, 2-0. The 
Falcons scored two runs to send the game into extra innings and in the eighth 
senior shortstop Kirk Hagge drove in the winning run with a single. 
</P>
<P>
 With one out, Hagge smacked a fastball into right field and Jesse Mitchell 
scored from second base. Mitchell walked and reached second on a groundout. 
</P>
<P>
 The Falcons scored their seventh-inning runs with two out. John French drove 
in the first one with an infield single and Jason Swims tied the score with an 
RBI single to center field. 
</P>
<P>
 "A couple of things went wrong for us early on and it would have been easy for 
us to just give up," Crescenta Valley Coach Tony Zarrillo said. "But we hung in 
there and we battled and we did great." 
</P>
<P>
 Channel Islands (17-11) scored all its runs in the first inning. Rene Sanchez, 
who singled to center, made it home on a fielder's choice. He advanced to 
second when Ysidro Alfaro walked and got to third on Javier Rios' bunt. 
</P>
<P>
 Tony De La Torre scored Channel Islands' second run on an error when Hagge 
couldn't hold on to Johnny Olivares' softly hit ball. 
</P>
<P>
 "We played great defense and we had great pitching but we couldn't get the 
runs we needed," Channel Islands Coach Al Tarazon said. "We came as close as we 
could, with two outs in the seventh and our best guy up on the mound with a 
little bit of gas left." 
</P>
<P>
 Sanchez (6-1) gave up only four hits in seven innings for Channel Islands. 
Senior Nacho Godinez (3-2), who started the eighth, took the loss. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior Garrett Lee (5-3) went the distance for the Falcons, giving up seven 
hits, walking three and striking out two. Falcon ace Jim Parque didn't start 
because he wasn't feeling good. He had flu-like symptoms, according to 
Zarrillo.

ALEMANY GETS PADDLED BY DEFIANT SIMI VALLEY; HIGH SCHOOL BASEBALL: PIONEERS 
SHOW SUPPORT FOR SCYPHERS BEFORE AND AFTER 13-7 VICTORY IN FIRST ROUND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Before taking the field for their first-round Southern Section Division I 
playoff game against Alemany High on Friday, Simi Valley baseball players 
gathered in a circle and stretched one hand toward a paddle held above them. 
</P>
<P>
 "Win," they shouted. 
</P>
<P>
 The moment was symbolic and prophetic. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pioneers won all right, swatting 15 hits and spanking Alemany, 13-7, 
before a standing-room-only crowd. The Pioneers (19-6) will meet Santa Monica, 
a 3-1 winner over Millikan, in a second-round game next week. 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley has won five in a row since Coach Mike Scyphers was suspended by 
school administrators in the wake of a police investigation into possible 
financial and disciplinary improprieties. 
</P>
<P>
 By displaying the paddle, the Pioneers were mocking criticism from school 
officials about "the block," a disciplinary practice that has been a staple of 
Simi Valley baseball for 16 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Geez, you know, I don't know how (the paddle) appeared out here," said Russ 
Stephans, the Pioneers' interim coach. "I looked up, it was just . . . there. 
Must have been a message from God." 
</P>
<P>
 The first nine Simi Valley batters reached base safely on two doubles, five 
singles and two errors by Indian shortstop Gus Lira in a six-run first inning. 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley made it 9-0 by adding three runs in the second inning on two hit 
batters, two walks, an error, a stolen base, a fielder's choice and a single. 
</P>
<P>
 Kary Kozlowski, Simi Valley's starter, cruised through four innings, allowing 
only a bunt single by Alex Peran in the first and an opposite-field single by 
Chris Yeaman in the fourth. 
</P>
<P>
 Only the Simi bullpen kept the game interesting. Alemany (20-8) scored five 
runs in the sixth and two more in the seventh against Pioneer relievers Casey 
Vermette and Jeff Weaver. 
</P>
<P>
 Ryan Hankins, making only his third pitching appearance of the season, came on 
to get the final two outs with the bases loaded. 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, Kozlowski, holding the paddle like a torch, led Simi Valley players 
in a victory lap around the bases. At home plate, Kozlowski stopped and gave 
each Pioneer player a playful tap on the rear as they passed by. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know, I specifically told them not to do that," Stephans said innocently. 
"I guess I won't be back next year."

CLU'S BECKER ARISES, UCSD SEES SHADOW

<P>
 John Becker's hot streak went into hibernation, but it didn't die. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cal Lutheran first baseman had 11 hits, four home runs and 14 runs batted 
in his previous seven games, but the team hadn't played for 12 days. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Kingsmen took the field Friday for the first game of the NCAA 
Division III West Regionals against UC San Diego, Becker's swing was just as he 
left it. 
</P>
<P>
 He doubled and homered, driving in all of Cal Lutheran's runs in a 5-3 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
 The winner of this weekend's best-of-five series will advance to the Division 
III championships next week in Battle Creek, Mich. The series continues today 
with a doubleheader starting at noon. 
</P>
<P>
 Becker drove in two runs with a two-out double in the third and three in the 
fifth with his 11th home run . 
</P>
<P>
 Becker's blast gave the seventh-ranked Kingsmen (30-6-1) a 5-0 lead and put 
the team well on its way to its third victory in three games over three seasons 
against Ryan Flanagan (8-3), the Tritons' ace left-hander. 
</P>
<P>
 Meantime, Cal Lutheran starter Sam Arroyo (9-1) cruised through the San Diego 
batting order. 
</P>
<P>
 The senior right-hander pitched eight brilliant innings, then staggered 
through the ninth to record his fourth complete game. 
</P>
<P>
 Arroyo gave up only four hits through the first eight innings, his only lapse 
being a two-run home run in the fifth by San Diego left fielder Craig Birk. 
</P>
<P>
 But Arroyo wore down in the final inning. He retired the first two batters 
when Scott Sebbo made a diving stop at third base and center fielder Jason 
Wilson caught a screaming line drive, but the fourth-ranked Tritons (28-5) then 
had three consecutive hits. 
</P>
<P>
 One run scored and runners were at first and third with Birk, the potential 
winning run, coming to the plate. 
</P>
<P>
 "I came out and told him, 'I'm not pulling you so you better get this guy 
out,' " Cal Lutheran Coach Marty Slimak said. 
</P>
<P>
 Arroyo induced a popup to second base. Perhaps as important as the victory, 
Arroyo was efficient with his pitches, meaning he might be available to pitch 
again if the series continues into Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Marc Weiss (9-1, 3.01 ERA) and David Jaglowski (5-1, 6.24) will start for the 
Kingsmen today, and Slimak hopes he doesn't need to worry about Sunday.  
</P>
<P>
 No other Cal Lutheran pitcher has made more than two starts all season.

FINAL OUT PUT SIGNATURE ON CSUN SEASON; COLLEGE BASEBALL: MATADORS' CAMPAIGN 
WAS A DISASTER, FROM OPENING SWEEP AT CAL POLY SLO TO ELIMINATION AT FRESNO 
STATE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE ELLING, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<P>
 The youngster held out a baseball and pen to Cal State Northridge first 
baseman Jason Shanahan, who seemed a little surprised, if not shellshocked. 
</P>
<P>
 Five minutes earlier, Shanahan had been thrown out at the plate in an 8-7 loss 
to Fresno State for the final, ignominious out of the season. Shanahan was 
still picking dirt from between his teeth when he fielded the request for his 
John Hancock. In Fresno, no less. 
</P>
<P>
 Shanahan palmed the ball, paused as he smiled and shook his head, then signed 
his name. Maybe he should have added as a postscript, Wait Till Next Year. 
</P>
<P>
 "The wounded dog is finally dead," pitcher Keven Kempton said. "Man, I've sat 
in my room for hours trying to figure out what went wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, Northridge ended its first season at the NCAA Division I level with a 
loss in the championship game of the West Regional at Fresno State. Three years 
later, the Matadors capped their most frustrating season under Coach Bill 
Kernen in the same ballpark. 
</P>
<P>
 Other than the site, the circumstances were completely different. Northridge 
finished 25-30 this season, posting its first losing record in Kernen's six 
years as coach. Under Kernen, the Matadors went to the NCAA playoffs three 
times in as many years at the Division I level. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm looking at this as having an opportunity to learn from failure," Kernen 
said. "Can you really appreciate winning until you're lost?" 
</P>
<P>
 The Matadors opened the season ranked 27th in Collegiate Baseball's preseason 
poll and had a pair of returning pitchers -- right-handers Keven Kempton and 
Marco Contreras, who combined to win 18 games as juniors. What's more, another 
starting pitcher, John Najar, pitched as well as anybody during the off-season. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge opened the spring with a three-game series on the road against Cal 
Poly San Luis Obispo, a solid Division II team. It was the beginning of SLO 
death. . . . The Matadors lost all three games -- and soon lost Kempton and 
Najar to arm injuries.  
</P>
<P>
 By season's end, five of nine pitchers on the opening-day roster were 
disabled. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of injury and attrition, only 14 of the 23 players who opened the 
season were still available to play in the season finale.  
</P>
<P>
 Not surprisingly, Northridge lost six of its last seven games with the 
skeleton crew, though the Matadors weren't eliminated from the weak Western 
Athletic Conference West Division race until the season's penultimate game. 
</P>
<P>
 Trouble appeared on other fronts. In January, after the Northridge earthquake 
rocked the campus, the team was forced to practice in a public park and a 
handful of games scheduled for Matador Field were played on the road. 
</P>
<P>
 The cinder-block outfield wall at Matador Field, abhorred by coaches and 
players alike, was damaged in the temblor. There was talk of replacing it with 
a more forgiving chain-link fence. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, it was rebuilt. The replacement blocks are gray, the old ones black. 
Only Al Davis would like the incongruent color scheme. 
</P>
<P>
 Cracked Kernen: "The Berlin Wall came down easier than that damn thing." 
</P>
<P>
 All in all, just another brick in the wall. From calamity to comedy, 1994 had 
it all. No matter was too picayune. These poor guys even violated the school 
dress code. 
</P>
<P>
 Team caps, which long had featured a capital N as the logo, were deep-sixed. 
School administrators sought consistency in athletic apparel for marketing 
reasons. Softball team caps feature a Matador caricature and his flowing red 
cape, for instance. 
</P>
<P>
 Ole! The baseball team did a sidestep. Said one player: "Nobody wearing knee 
sox goes on my head." 
</P>
<P>
 The compromise wasn't any better. Instead, players wore hats with CAL STATE 
NORTHRIDGE emblazoned in capital letters across the front. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bookstore hats," players grumbled. 
</P>
<P>
 Call Kernen the Mad Hatter. By midseason, the coach figured out that 
Northridge's struggles were as attributable to a poor work ethic as to mediocre 
talent. 
</P>
<P>
 Perturbed by a handful of players who were skipping class, arriving late for 
practices and playing selfishly, he nearly pulled the plug. 
</P>
<P>
 Before a March 30 game with Cal Lutheran, Kernen trashed the clubhouse and 
refused to allow his players to wear their uniform tops. The team played in 
their black undershirts. Most of the starters were benched, forcing pitchers to 
play afield. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had guys who refused to be trained," Kernen said. "They never signed up 
for (the program). We were never a team." 
</P>
<P>
 During the Cal Lutheran fiasco, players hoisted the American flag over the 
clubhouse to half-mast, which later drew criticism from athletic department 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Kernen was so miffed at his players' often lethargic manner that he rescued 
his old cap, the one with the capital N, from the mothballs because he didn't 
want to wear the same chapeau as his players. 
</P>
<P>
 Kernen, whose three-year contract runs through 1996, is chasing hard-hat types 
to help turn the program around next spring. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our problems all go back to the central issue," he said. "I didn't do a good 
job of recruiting over the last couple of years. I didn't get enough good kids 
in terms of talent and character." 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, he has been pounding the recruiting trail. He no longer will rely 
on the evaluations and recommendations of others. 
</P>
<P>
 So Kernen is recruiting "animals." But they need to be the right kind. 
</P>
<P>
 The coach "X'd out" one prospect when Kernen saw the player heave his 
equipment all over the field during a game. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got guys who can do that already," Kernen cracked. 
</P>
<P>
 This is a program whose lifeblood has been overachievers who refused to be 
outworked by other teams.  
</P>
<P>
 Sure, Kernen would love to unearth some unknown like Chan Ho Park, but he'd 
rather make Matador Field a gung-ho park. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, that still takes talent. 
</P>
<P>
 "Willie Shoemaker won 8,833 races," Kernen said. "And he never once carried 
the horse across the finish line." 
</P>
<P>
 When Kernen was an assistant at Cal State Fullerton, he used to keep a note 
taped to his mirror. It read: Recruiting is like shaving. Do it every day or 
you look like a bum.  
</P>
<P>
 "This year I definitely looked homeless," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The note is back on his mirror. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge already has signed four players to letters of intent and has made 
offers to several others. 
</P>
<P>
 Expect some changes next season, including a larger roster in addition to 
plenty of new faces. Kernen plans to sit down with players over the next few 
days to discuss their respective futures. Some doubtlessly will be elsewhere 
next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those who won't return, of course, are seniors Joey Arnold, Keyaan Cook 
and Contreras. To some degree, their final season of eligibility was sacrificed 
so that Kernen could right the ship. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't lie and say I wasn't disappointed," Contreras said. "But I don't 
question the way (Kernen) went about it. He had to do what he had to do and I 
respect him enough not to question it." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Kempton, who will be a senior in 1995: "Kernen was right where he needed 
to be (in taking action). He put his reputation on the line and we let him 
down. He took a lot of heat and we didn't back him up." 
</P>
<P>
 Kempton, recovering from reconstructive elbow surgery, already has his own 
catch phrase for next season: "Alive in '95." 
</P>
<P>
 He might just as easily have chosen: "No More Like '94." 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to get cocky again," Kempton said. "We need to get the feeling back. 
We can't let this happen again."

HIGHLAND WINS AS VOLLEYBALL TAKES HOLD IN DESERT SAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNEDY COSGROVE, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At Highland High -- all of five years old -- volleyball is the newest craze, 
and after the Bulldogs beat established Canyon in a Southern Section Division 
II playoff quarterfinal Friday night, it looks like a fad that may have some 
staying power. 
</P>
<P>
 "Volleyball in the high desert -- quite a concept," said Highland Coach Mike 
Bird as about 50 students and parents danced on the floor after Highland's 
7-15, 15-12, 13-15, 15-4, 15-9 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "It took a while for the idea to catch on, but this is what I dreamed of when 
I came here," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In just the third year of fielding a varsity, Bird -- who played at Cal State 
Northridge in the mid-1980s -- has worked wonders. 
</P>
<P>
 Highland (17-0) has won the Golden League championship, the Redondo Beach 
tournament and advanced to the Division II semifinal, where it will meet 
Thousand Oaks on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're a really good team," said Canyon's Brentt Phillips, who had a 
team-high 22 kills. "And they were pretty good last year." 
</P>
<P>
 And two years ago? 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't remember them," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Phillips and the Cowboys (15-4) likely won't soon forget this match -- their 
third loss to Highland this season -- and probably will see Highland middle 
blocker Mac Wilson in their sleep. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson, a 6-foot-8 senior, had 20 kills and 15 blocks and proved to be the 
difference in the match. He scored four of Highland's final five points, three 
on blocks and one on a kill, as the Bulldogs closed the tension-filled match 
with a 5-0 run. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was phenomenal," Bird said. "Just phenomenal." 
</P>
<P>
 He wasn't the only one. Six-seven junior Ryan Millar played an uneven match, 
but still finished with 30 kills and seven blocks. 
</P>
<P>
 Bulldog Robert Nester added 16 kills and was the team's best passer, and Neal 
Scott had 17 kills. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't imagine anything sweeter than this," Bird said. 
</P>
<P>
 Stay tuned.

MOORPARK WINGS IT, SCORES 15 RUNS AGAINST SANTA YNEZ

<P>
 Butterflies were flying in Moorpark on Friday -- and not because the first 
sunshine in about two weeks made for a brilliant spring day. 
</P>
<P>
 They were fluttering in the stomachs of nervous Moorpark High baseball players 
before their rematch with Santa Ynez, the team that upset them at home in the 
first round of the 1993 Southern Section playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Thanks to a 10-run fifth inning, Moorpark overcame the yips and pummeled Santa 
Ynez, 15-1, in the first round of the Division IV playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 "All we've talked about all week was revenge," Musketeer shortstop Rick 
Collier said. "This was good revenge." 
</P>
<P>
 Adam Rauch belted a home run in the first inning to make it 1-0, Collier 
ripped a bases-loaded double to break a tie and make it 3-1, and Jason Adamson 
added a three-run homer in the fifth. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was pretty nervous," said Rauch, the senior left fielder who made a couple 
of errors in the Pirates' 13-12 victory last year. "I had some butterflies, but 
I guess I had them flying in formation." 
</P>
<P>
 While Rauch (three for four), Collier (two for three, two doubles) and Adamson 
(two for four) accounted for seven of the nine hits by Moorpark (20-4), Brian 
Garrettson threw a net over the Pirates, striking out nine and walking none in 
six innings to improve to 9-0. 
</P>
<P>
 "We came back from nine down to lead, 11-10, last year after I came in to 
relieve, and I blew the lead," Garrettson said. "I started aiming the ball and 
walking everybody. I walked in the tying run, then I gave up a single for the 
winning run. I'm not giving any free passes now." 
</P>
<P>
 But four Santa Ynez pitchers gave up plenty: 13 walks and three hit batsmen. 
Moorpark had six hits in the fifth inning, but Santa Ynez (12-12) gave up four 
walks and committed three errors before Adamson capped it by sending reliever 
Andy Kocher's first pitch over the 350-foot sign in left-center.

GARGIULO GOES THE DISTANCE TO WIN 5,000 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN ORTEGA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After concentrating on road racing and cross-country for the last three years, 
Tim Gargiulo of the Reebok Racing Team made a successful return to the track in 
the Asics Twilight Distance Classic at Birmingham High on Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Gargiulo, a 1990 graduate of Southern Methodist, ran a personal best of 13 
minutes 46.12 seconds to win the 5,000 meters by more than 25 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 With a goal of 13:45 -- an average of 66 seconds per 400 -- Gargiulo took the 
lead after 600 meters and never relinquished it. 
</P>
<P>
 "All I was thinking about was running 66 every lap," Gargiulo said. 
"Everything I've been doing in practice has been at that tempo, whether it's 
1,000s, 800s or 400s, so I felt like I could run that fast." 
</P>
<P>
 After coming through the first 1,000 meters in 2:46.0, Gargiulo ran successive 
kilometers of 2:45.7, 2:46.8 and 2:46.3 before running the final 1,000 in 
2:41.3. 
</P>
<P>
 Gargiulo's time, which lowered his previous best by four seconds, was 
particularly impressive because there was no one to push him for the last nine 
laps. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was hoping that there would be some other guys with me because it's always 
easier to run fast when you're in a pack, but I was confident I could do it on 
my own," said Gargiulo, the United States' top finisher in the World 
cross-country championships in Budapest, Hungary, in March. 
</P>
<P>
 The meet continues with races in the collegiate-open division tonight at 7:30. 
</P>
<P>
 Meredith Rainey of Footlocker, fifth in the women's 800 in last year's World 
Championships, won that event in 2:02.91. 
</P>
<P>
 The Harvard graduate followed Regina Jacobs of the Mizuno Track Club through 
the first 400 in 60.5 before moving into the lead with 250 meters left and 
pulling away. 
</P>
<P>
 Jacobs, a 1981 graduate of what is now Campbell Hall High and a two-time 
Olympian in the 1,500, finished second in 2:05.79. 
</P>
<P>
 Christian Cushing-murray of the Santa Monica Track Club was favored in the 
men's 1,500 after running 3:39.96 to win last week's Occidental Invitational, 
but the former North Hollywood High standout finished 13th in 3:45.0 after 
leading the field through 1,200 meters in 2:58.5. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Dailey of Reebok was in fourth place entering the final homestretch, but 
finished strongly to win in 3:40.39. 
</P>
<P>
 Jamey Harris of Fresno State was second in 3:40.86, followed by Jim Sorensen 
(3:40.91), who was competing unattached. 
</P>
<P>
 Fran ten Bensel of New Balance won the women's 1,500 in 4:17.48, followed by 
Cathy Palacios (4:18.91) of Asics.

MUSTAFA HAS JUST A SUPER DAY IN DECATHLON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KIRBY LEE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sporting a sleeveless shirt with the Superman emblem, Isaiah Mustafa of 
Moorpark College definitely dressed the part Friday in the state junior college 
championships at Cerritos College. 
</P>
<P>
 He's playing the part, too. 
</P>
<P>
 Mustafa leads the decathlon after the first day of competition with 3,791 
points, holding an 87-point lead over Jon Parry of Taft. Mike Wright of 
Hartnell is third with 3,576. 
</P>
<P>
 He also placed fourth in the long jump, sailing 23 feet 8 1/4 inches between 
decathlon events. 
</P>
<P>
 "I usually wear a Spiderman shirt," Mustafa said. "But I decided to get a 
Superman shirt for this meet because it takes that kind of effort." 
</P>
<P>
 An effort like Friday's could put the 6-foot-4, 205-pound sophomore from Santa 
Clara High over his personal-best of 6,417 points. He is 121 points ahead of 
that pace. 
</P>
<P>
 The second day's competition includes the 110-meter high hurdles, discus, pole 
vault, javelin and 1,500 meters, traditionally Mustafa's weaker events. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, Mustafa timed 11.05 seconds in the first event with the second-best 
time of the 12-man field. He scored 866 points in the long jump with a jump of 
23-8 1/4 with the best mark of the competition on his third and final attempt, 
taking a 62-point lead after two events. 
</P>
<P>
 He finished with the best-four mark in the shotput with a heave of 36-7 1/2 
and cleared 6-6 in the high jump while intermittently taking his turn in the 
long jump. 
</P>
<P>
 Mustafa leaped 23-8 1/4 on his last two attempts, equaling his personal best 
for the third time of the day, to open his biggest lead of 125 points. Moments 
after taking his sixth jump, Mustafa had to race over to the start of the 400 
meters. He managed to run 51.79 despite tying up in the final 150 meters. 
</P>
<P>
 Mustafa caught a break when Northern California champion Alphonzo Davis of 
Sacramento, who has scored 6,698 points, scratched from the competition after 
failing to clear a height in the high jump. 
</P>
<P>
 Kate Stoll of Canyons was second in the javelin with a toss of 139-10 and Mark 
Sinderson of Antelope Valley was third in the 10,000 meters, timing 31:34.02 in 
a race won by Wilhelm Gidabuday of Riverside in a state-meet record time of 
29:39.31. 
</P>
<P>
 Auria Roberto of Glendale placed fifth in the 5,000 in 17:52.58, shaving 
nearly four seconds off her school-record 17:56.15. Teresa Santana of Antelope 
Valley was sixth in 17:59.10. 
</P>
<P>
 Riverside, the defending state women's champion, was bolstered by wins by 
Astia Walker in the 100 hurdles (13.76) and 200 meters (23.41) and leads Long 
Beach, 42-24, after 10 of 31 events. 
</P>
<P>
 Former Birmingham High standouts Raymond Banner and Tony Serpas, now competing 
for Long Beach, placed fourth and sixth in the 110-meter high hurdles and 200 
in 14.47 and 21.51, helping the Vikings take a 19-point lead with 41 points in 
the men's competition.

TRIAL SEEMS LIKELY FOR VAN BUREN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Neither side changed its position Friday when Ventura County prosecutors and 
the attorney for Leodes Van Buren met to discuss the felony weapons charge 
faced by the All-State football player from Newbury Park High. 
</P>
<P>
 Both sides expect the case to go to trial in Superior Court, probably next 
month.A preliminary hearing is scheduled for Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Buren, 18, was arrested April 8 on suspicion of firing a single shot from 
a handgun through the back door of his girlfriend's home in Newbury Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Buren contends that a companion actually pulled the trigger. 
</P>
<P>
 The status of Van Buren's football scholarship at Colorado is uncertain 
pending the outcome of the case. 
</P>
<P>
 The 6-foot-1, 190-pound wide receiver led Newbury Park to the Southern Section 
Division III championship last fall. He is the state's all-time leader in 
receptions and receiving yardage. KENNEDY COSGROVE

COLLEGE NOTEBOOK: PROVIDING FOOD FOR THOUGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Let 'em eat . . . raisins? 
</P>
<P>
 Parents of a few Cal State Northridge baseball players were somewhat peeved 
last week when their sons had empty pockets and empty stomachs in Fresno. 
</P>
<P>
 The Matadors, on the last trip of the season, weren't given their food 
allowance until after returning home. The Northridge coaching staff withheld 
the money, $17.50 per day, until all school equipment and uniforms were 
returned. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been that way on every team I've ever been on," said assistant Mike 
Batesole, who reached the double-A level in the Dodgers' minor league system. 
"Some of that stuff's valuable." 
</P>
<P>
 Batesole told the team before the trip that the players wouldn't receive their 
allowance until after the trip, which a player confirmed. 
</P>
<P>
 It was news to many parents, who thought their sons were wasting away by the 
minute. In fact, Batesole, who handles the per diem distribution, said he 
personally loaned money to a couple of players who ran short of funds. 
</P>
<P>
 On the bus ride home from Fresno, most of the grumbling was probably emanating 
from the players' mouths, not their stomachs. Fresno State swept the three-game 
series, handing the Matadors their fourth consecutive loss to close the year. 
JUNIOR COLLEGES 
</P>
<P>
 Pirates Get Their Share 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura College shared the Western State Conference overall sports title with 
Cuesta for the 1993-94 school year. Each school scored 90 points, which are 
awarded based on final WSC standings in each sport. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura received most of its points by winning championships in men's and 
women's basketball, men's swimming and women's cross-country. 
</P>
<P>
 Moorpark finished fourth (71.5 points), Canyons was sixth (41), Glendale took 
seventh (37), Valley tied for eighth with Santa Barbara (34), Pierce came in 
10th (30) and Oxnard finished 11th (13). 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At 6-feet-4 and 170 pounds, Isaac Turner of Glendale towers over his 
competitors in the 800-meter run, but Vaquero Coach Tom McMurray would like to 
see him throw his weight around more often. 
</P>
<P>
 McMurray says that Turner is too tentative about maintaining his position in 
the pack during a race. The Southern California championships last week were a 
good example. Turner allowed himself to be boxed in with 350 meters left and 
had to move from fifth to second in the final 200. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Turner's time of 1 minute 51.77 seconds was a personal best, McMurray 
said that Bob Blanchard's school record of 1:50.7 (set in 1964) should have 
fallen. 
</P>
<P>
 "Getting boxed in like that cost him the school record," McMurray said. "He 
made a big run over the final 300 meters, but by the time he hit the 
homestretch, he started to run out of gas because of all the energy he expended 
in working his way up through the pack." Around the Campuses . . . 
</P>
<P>
 * Mission right fielder Jesus Perez set a school record this season by being 
hit by a pitch 17 times. 
</P>
<P>
 * Pierce second baseman Cesar Martinez set a Western State Conference record 
with 30 stolen bases. 
</P>
<P>
 * Catcher Adam Basua had the only home run by Oxnard in WSC play. By contrast, 
Glendale led the conference with 30 homers. Randy Vickers of Glendale was the 
conference champion with eight, followed by teammates Steve Mikesell and Bryan 
Warner, each with seven.

DIGEST: ANGEL EYES U.S. OPEN, PASSES ON CIF MEET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Golf standout Darren Angel of Granada Hills High, who won his second 
consecutive City Section title this week and led the Highlanders to the team 
championship, will pass up the CIF-Southern California Golf Assn. championships 
to play in a U.S. Open qualifying tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Both the high school tournament at Redlands Country Club and the Open 
qualifier at Lake Merced Golf and Country Club in Daly City, Calif., are 
scheduled for June 6.

 Angel, a junior who won the City title with back-to-back 69s, qualified for 
the sectional by winning a local qualifying event Monday with a one-under-par 
71 at Rio Bravo Resort in Bakersfield. 
</P>
<P>
 "The U.S. Open is a little more important," Angel said. The Open is June 16-19 
at Oakmont Country Club in Oakmont, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
 Angel's absence won't help Granada Hills' chances in the team competition, 
which features schools from the City, Southern, San Diego and Central sections. 
Angel almost single-handedly led the Highlanders to the title. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Joe White told his team after the two-day tournament: "You guys ought to 
pick Darren up and carry him off on your shoulders. He carried you both days 
(of the event)." Field Hockey

 Pfizer Penile Implant Suit Expected: A class-action lawsuit was expected to be 
filed in federal court in San Francisco on Friday against a subsidiary of 
Pfizer Inc., alleging that penile implants it markets are defective and 
dangerous, two law firms said. The suit will seek unspecified compensatory and 
punitive damages against American Medical Systems Inc., the largest U.S. 
manufacturer of silicone penile implants, the San Francisco law firms said in a 
statement.

THEATER REVIEW; A DELICATE 'SHADOWLANDS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T.H. McCULLOH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The rarefied private worlds of literary giants sometimes have an antique 
bloom, an aura of such delicate shading that often it is difficult for 
playwrights to duplicate the emotional settings with a sense of honesty. 
</P>
<P>
 With "Shadowlands" (at the Long Beach Studio Theatre), William Nicholson 
accomplished the task with intelligence, humor and a great understanding of the 
enigma that was author C.S. Lewis.  
</P>
<P>
 There also is a daunting challenge to actors who play these figures, not to 
make them simplistic, not to sketch them in strokes too broad and transparent. 
And to directors, not to overplay the playwright's hand by misplacing the 
emphasis. 
</P>
<P>
 In one of the Long Beach Studio's finest moments, director Joanne Gordon has 
wrought a production of Nicholson's drama that not only captures the 
microcosmic Oxonian world in which Lewis spent most of his life, but gives it a 
sense of immediacy and truth. Her casting is impeccable, and her comprehension 
of the humor, wit and intellectual fermentation during Lewis' late discovery of 
romance, and love, is at once delicate and forceful. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Fimiani gives a luminous performance as Lewis, at first slightly stodgy, 
growing subtly more youthful as he realizes that a younger writer and admirer, 
Joy Gresham, has revolutionized not only his daily life but his very 
philosophy. Fimiani's control and restraint during the moments when Lewis is 
beginning to open his heart and his soul to Joy are flawless. 
</P>
<P>
 Dorothy A. Gallagher's exuberant Joy, an American riding her literary dream 
roughshod into the musty Oxford milieu, is balanced delicately against Lewis' 
civility. Gallagher knows where Joy's charm is; where her unhappy marriage has 
left her emotionally, and where her courage and her worship of Lewis' writing 
have brought her. 
</P>
<P>
 These two performances are blended into a buoyant and eventually 
heart-wrenching mix that, like a fine sauce or a Baroque concerto, gives the 
relationship a richness and humanity that seems total. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Fimiani and Gallagher are helped by an exemplary supporting cast, most notably 
Robert Kokol, verging marvelously on an academic Col. Blimp as Lewis' ebullient 
and understanding brother, Warnie; Jonathan Turco as Joy's son, full of wonder 
at the new world into which his mother has drawn him, and Jimmie D. Hudson, 
John Ross Clark and John C. Barry as Lewis' and Warnie's Oxford colleagues, 
whose senses of detail and color place the action exactly were it should be. 
</P>
<P>
 The set by Bradley Kaye and Stephen Shapiro proves that a small stage is no 
deterrent to impressive effects: A turntable brings set pieces for the multiple 
locations smoothly and silently into place at just the right moment, and a 
paneled background opens magically as Joy's son is drawn more and more into the 
wonderland of Lewis' children's books, to hide from the tragedy about to engulf 
both him and the author. 
</P>
<P>
 Norma Garza's intricate lighting, Naomi Yoshida Rodriguez's evocative costumes 
and Justus Matthews' gentle sound design are integral parts of an impressive 
whole.

MANY FACES TO 'NIGHTFALLS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 T.H. McCulloh's review of "Nightfalls in L.A." ("Problems Make for Long 
'Nightfalls,' " May 10) is both inexplicably narrow in focus and gratuitously 
mean-spirited, just the opposite of the play's open and generous qualities. 
</P>
<P>
 The subject of the play concerns what happens in this large, multicultural 
city that is Los Angeles and directs our attention, though not exclusively, to 
its problems of racism, class-ism and sexism, and to its physically and 
socially fragile environment. 
</P>
<P>
 What holds the play together is, it seems, just exactly what McCulloh didn't 
like: its fidelity to the tragicomedy of such a diverse city and the really 
quite excellent performances of its cast of 17 multiracial, multicultural 
actors playing 41 different parts. 
</P>
<P>
 The play is itself a contribution both to an understanding and a pulling 
together of a very complex urban society that has become increasingly divided 
over the last X number of years. 
</P>
<P>
 Author and director John Ferzacca and his largely oppressed, frightened and 
recurrently rather bewildered characters should be congratulated for their 
sometimes chillingly and otherwise hilariously moving contribution to 
contemporary theater.

BUILDING UP POWER; MANDATE FOR ELECTRIC VEHICLES GIVES INFRASTRUCTURE A CHARGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL PARRISH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Preparations for the arrival of electric cars are speeding up now that the 
technology has passed a crucial review by the California Air Resources Board. 
</P>
<P>
 And Mickey Oros is right in the thick of things. 
</P>
<P>
 The former design engineer for commercial buildings now heads Electric Vehicle 
Infrastructure Inc. in Fair Oaks, a Sacramento suburb. His small company has 
spent most of the past three years building infrastructure equipment to support 
electric cars. The 150 or so charging stations it has installed around 
Sacramento are in routine use. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was just kind of amazing," Oros said of one recent encounter. "We saw the 
driver, a local doctor, pull up. And he just jumped out, plugged in and did his 
shopping." 
</P>
<P>
 In building the chargers and their control equipment, Oros has met head-on 
many of the practical problems that are the next big hurdles in introducing 
electric vehicles -- from determining true unit costs of the equipment to 
settling liability and municipal zoning issues for the chargers installed in 
shopping center parking lots. 
</P>
<P>
 By summer's end, the state Public Utilities Commission is expected to rule on 
utility requests to use nearly $600 million in ratepayer funds to encourage 
electric cars, including construction of charging stations in parking lots, at 
minimarkets, on AAA-type roadside service vehicles and in residential garages 
throughout California. 
</P>
<P>
 The utilities also want ratepayers to finance incentives for potential 
customers that would help offset the expected higher cost of first-generation 
electric cars. Federal law provides buyers a tax credit of up to $4,000. The 
utilities want state credits of $1,000 or more added. 
</P>
<P>
 Not all electric car backers agree, however. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would be reluctant to support broad-based vehicle sales incentives so long 
as the (auto) industry continues to oppose us at every turn," said California 
Energy Commission Chairman Charles R. Imbrecht. He said the proposed incentives 
could, in effect, send $70 million from utility ratepayers to the auto makers. 
</P>
<P>
 Air Resources Board Chairwoman Jacqueline Schafer, announcing a week ago that 
the board would stick to its 1998 deadline for introducing zero-emission cars, 
said the ARB's attention would now turn to "implementation issues, including 
market development, incentives and infrastructure." 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, the board will weigh giving free parking or car pool lane access 
to buyers of electric vehicles. It may also extend its air pollution credit 
benefits to makers of hydrogen-powered vehicles or so-called hybrid electrics, 
which use small, low-polluting auxiliary engines to extend the range of 
electric cars. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the utilities, auto makers and regulators are already arm-wrestling 
over technical standards for charging electric cars, ways to keep them from 
interfering with neighborhood TV reception, and the changes that will be needed 
in fire and electrical codes. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're planning a large-scale meeting that has all the players -- auto makers, 
state agencies, the utilities," said Diane O. Wittenberg, Southern California 
Edison Co.'s manager of electric transportation. 
</P>
<P>
 The utilities also plan to directly stimulate a market for electric cars, even 
before the 1998 deadline, aiming to push prices lower in the process. EV 
America, a national coalition sponsored by the electric utilities, will place 
orders in the next few months for 5,000 electric vehicles, primarily for 
utility fleets. 
</P>
<P>
 Ordinary drivers will get to try out General Motors Corp.'s sporty Impact 
electric car beginning in June, in the first public exposure of a 
high-performance electric car. Eighty volunteers selected by Edison and the Los 
Angeles Department of Water and Power will test the cars for two to four weeks 
each. San Diego Gas & Electric Co. expects to receive Impacts for testing in 
August, 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Air Resources Board has sent a wonderful green flag, and the race is on," 
said Mike Gage, president of Calstart, the public-private consortium promoting 
an advanced transportation industry in California. 
</P>
<P>
 By the end of the year, Calstart members will have rolled out almost 80 
electric cars or trucks, eight buses and support equipment such as multiple 
charging kiosks that can serve up to a dozen cars at once. 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond that, the World Resources Institute and other environmental groups have 
launched their next campaign: to make a large-scale switch to electric and 
hydrogen cars -- both zero-emission vehicles -- the long-term goal of 
transportation planners. 
</P>
<P>
 While natural gas, ethanol, methanol and other alternative fuels burn cleaner 
than conventional gasoline, they don't make the big inroads that zero-emission 
cars do against air pollution, the greenhouse effect and U.S. reliance on 
foreign oil, according to a new institute report titled "The Keys to the Car." 
</P>
<P>
 The "national push to introduce any and all forms of alternative fuels . . . 
will ultimately be seen as misguided," said the report's author, James J. 
MacKenzie. Care and Feeding of the Electric Car 
</P>
<P>
 Substantial additions to public and private facilities are planned before the 
first mandated electric cars go on sale in California in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
 * Electric utility load-management hardware and rates to handle power demands 
that will be changed by the addition of electric cars, which can use so much 
electricity that they have been called "rolling houses." 
</P>
<P>
 * Charging pedestals and a universal billing system, at service stations, work 
sites, shopping malls, hotels. 
</P>
<P>
 * Smart home charging units to alert drivers when they have forgotten to plug 
in at night and to delay charging until the off-peak, late-night hours, when 
electricity is cheapest. 
</P>
<P>
 * Mobile charging vehicles, such as AAA roadside service trucks, for emergency 
charging. 
</P>
<P>
 * Building code changes to require 240-volt, 30-amp outlets in new garages and 
to allow blanket permitting for charging installations. 
</P>
<P>
 * Emergency worker training to instruct fire and police personnel in the 
handling of accidents. 
</P>
<P>
 * Battery disposal facilities for recycling or disposing of electric car 
batteries. 
</P>
<P>
 * Repair facilities staffed with specially trained mechanics.

BOND YIELDS RISE, STOCKS END MIXED; MARKETS: THE DOLLAR SLIPS AGAINST THE MARK 
AND YEN. INFLATION FEARS RETURN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bond yields rose sharply Friday as rising commodity prices fueled inflation 
fears and the dollar slumped to a two-week low against the German mark. 
</P>
<P>
 But stocks ended mixed, despite the rising interest rates and the falling 
dollar. 
</P>
<P>
 The Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond yield closed at 7.30%, up from 7.23% on 
Thursday. Its price, which moves in the opposite direction, fell 25/32 point, 
or $7.81 per $1,000 in face value. 
</P>
<P>
 The day began with bonds trading lower because of a selloff overseas before 
the U.S. markets opened, said John Canavan, an analyst with Stone & McCarthy 
Research Associates Inc. in Princeton, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
 And with the Federal Reserve Board's short-term interest rate increases out of 
the way for now, and no important economic data for guidance, the bond market 
followed the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar spent the day falling against the German mark and the Japanese yen, 
among other key currencies. A weaker dollar makes dollar-denominated securities 
less valuable to foreign investors. 
</P>
<P>
 In New York, the dollar fetched 1.647 German marks, down from Thursday's 
1.657. The greenback fell to 104.05 Japanese yen, down from 104.25. 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar opened lower against the mark in Europe, as the German currency 
retained strength from comments Thursday by Bundesbank President Hans Tietmeyer 
that interest rates will remain steady. Traders watched for central bank 
intervention as the dollar selloff continued, and when no action was taken, the 
currency continued to fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, futures prices of most commodities, including gold, oil and grains, 
advanced. 
</P>
<P>
 Gold shot higher on the New York Comex, closing at $385.90 an ounce, up $4.50. 
Light, sweet crude oil settled at $18.92 per barrel, up 47 cents, at the New 
York Merc, its highest level in almost a year. 
</P>
<P>
 This was considered a sign of inflation, which the bond market abhors because 
it erodes the value of fixed-income securities such as Treasury notes. 
</P>
<P>
 Canavan also said there was volatility in the market as futures options 
expired about 1 p.m. and traders rushed to square their positions. The long 
bond fell as much as 1 1/32 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Stocks followed bond prices lower most of the day, but buy programs kicked in 
near the close and pushed the Dow Jones industrial average into positive 
territory. The blue chip average ended up 7.37 to 3,766.35, boosting the week's 
gains to 106.67. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow lost as much as 17 points by midafternoon. Then options expirations 
prompted program traders to move in. 
</P>
<P>
 However, declining issues outnumbered advancers by 1,145 to 1,030 on the New 
York Stock Exchange, where 293.52 million shares changed hands, down from 
307.35 million on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Broad-market indexes were mixed. The NYSE's composite index fell 0.58 to 
251.58. The Standard & Poor's composite index fell 1.56 to 454.92. The Nasdaq 
composite index of mostly smaller companies fell 0.61 to 726.70. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Friday's stock market highlights:  
</P>
<P>
 * Autodesk dropped 2 3/4 to 50 1/4. Prudential Securities and Alex. Brown cut 
their estimates, citing a product delay. 
</P>
<P>
 * Amoco gained 2 to 58 1/4 and Prudential Securities upgraded the stock to 
"buy" from "hold." 
</P>
<P>
 * Chrysler, which raised its dividend 25% on Thursday, gained 1 3/8 to 48 1/2. 
Ford added 5/8 to 59 3/4 and General Motors tacked on 1/8 to 55 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Kansas City Southern eased 1 3/8 to 44 1/8. The stock was up sharply earlier 
in the week on speculation its rail unit may be sold for $2 billion. 
</P>

'STAR TREK' HAS BEEN A VIRTUAL MONEY MACHINE. NOW A NEW SERIES, FILM ARE DUE 
WITH . . .; PARAMOUNT SET 'TO BOLDLY GO' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 When the final episode of "Star Trek: The Next Generation" airs Monday, 
Paramount Pictures will pull the plug on its biggest profit maker. Paramount 
executives are unfazed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I sleep well," says Kerry McCluggage, chairman of Paramount TV Group. 
</P>
<P>
 And well he should. Paramount believes that in "Star Trek" it has found the 
proverbial pot of gold at the end of the rainbow: an entertainment property 
suited to endless exploitation. It's the kind of hit every studio dreams of but 
few can actually claim. 
</P>
<P>
 Now some in Hollywood are wondering if, in rebuilding the studio after its 
takeover by Viacom, Paramount is not relying too heavily on what insiders there 
call "the franchise." 
</P>
<P>
 The studio is rushing to complete a fall release of its seventh "Star Trek" 
sequel -- advanced several months to plug holes in its release schedule -- as 
well as readying its fourth TV series, "Star Trek: Voyager," which will also 
serve as the January launch pad for Paramount's fifth network. "Voyager" will 
air even as three previous "Star Trek" series crowd the airwaves. 
</P>
<P>
 "What level of saturation can the market bear?" ponders one former Paramount 
executive. "Gene Roddenberry would be doing a few flips in the ground right 
now." The late Roddenberry was fiercely protective of his creation and 
frequently battled Paramount executives over creative aspects of the movies and 
series. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the last seven years, "Next Generation" alone has brought in an estimated 
$511 million in revenue and $293 million in profit -- marking it as one of the 
most successful TV shows in history. The price of a 30-second commercial, 
usually about $110,000, reached $700,000 for the final episode. 
</P>
<P>
 The seemingly endless movie sequels, TV series spinoffs and merchandising 
bonanza "Star Trek" has spawned since its inception has grossed more than $1.3 
billion for the studio. 
</P>
<P>
 It is with an eye to preserving and expanding the so-called franchise that 
Paramount decided two years ago that, even if "Next Generation" showed no signs 
of slipping in the ratings, it would be terminated after its seventh season. 
</P>
<P>
 "The original episodes have been outstanding, but once they start repeating 
five days a week we're usually looking at a declining ratings pattern over 
time," McCluggage says. "We didn't want stations to choke on all those 
episodes." 
</P>
<P>
 As it turned out, "Next Generation" reruns have held up better than expected. 
"Next Generation" is the highest-rated "first-run" series in syndication, an 
area of the industry where failure is extremely costly but success begets 
phenomenal wealth. 
</P>
<P>
 There are various explanations for the success of "Star Trek," from story 
lines inspired by the Bible and Shakespeare to Roddenberry's vision of an 
"optimistic future." Michael Piller, one of the executive producers, says 
simply that the movies and shows strike chords with people because they address 
"the human condition." 
</P>
<P>
 Industry executives estimate that "Next Generation" pulled in an average of 
$50 million annually in advertising revenue, more than enough to offset the 
$1.4-million production cost per episode. In addition, Paramount grossed about 
$161 million on the sale of rerun rights for "Next Generation" -- virtually all 
of it profit for the studio. 
</P>
<P>
 The third "Star Trek" series, "Deep Space Nine," although not as highly rated 
as "Next Generation," nonetheless pulls in about $40 million annually in 
advertising revenue. The rerun rights are expected to exceed those of "Next 
Generation." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps nowhere does Paramount exploit the "Star Trek" franchise more shrewdly 
than in merchandising, which has yielded $750 million in retail sales -- 
everything from boxer shorts and $2,000 chess sets to computer screen savers. 
Paramount usually gets a 10% royalty. Next up: "Branded electronics" featuring 
Star Trek personal computers and mobile phones. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that there haven't been a few misses along the way. A Saturday morning 
cartoon version of "Star Trek" fizzled, and an action toy licensee never caught 
on with kids a few years ago. "A lot of it has to do with timing," says Andrea 
Hein, president of Paramount Licensing Group. 
</P>
<P>
 But the concern among several "Star Trek" observers both inside and outside 
Paramount is whether the studio might actually be endangering its franchise now 
by overexposing it. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time "Voyager" premieres in January, many TV stations will be carrying 
four "Star Trek" series: the original 79 episodes from the 1960s NBC series, 
the "Next Generation" reruns and the original "Deep Space Nine" episodes. Those 
shows will be airing on the heels of the Thanksgiving theatrical release of 
"Star Trek: Generations." 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there's definitely a question of how much time people are going to 
devote" to watching "Star Trek" shows, says Piller. "There has already been an 
effect on the cumulative ratings." 
</P>
<P>
 True, the ratings for "Deep Space Nine" are running about 25% below that of 
"Next Generation," but that could be because the former is only two seasons old 
and is scheduled in worse time slots than the latter. 
</P>
<P>
 Nobody knows this better than Rick Berman, the 48-year-old executive now 
wearing the "Star Trek" mantle left by creator Gene Roddenberry. Berman, a 
onetime documentary filmmaker, looks like he carries the weight of the world on 
his shoulders. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, Berman may be carrying the weight of Paramount on his shoulders. He 
is producing the $25-million feature film as well as overseeing next season's 
plans for "Deep Space Nine" and pre-production on the launch of "Voyager." The 
three productions are taking up eight sound stages on Paramount's lot and 
employing 500 people. 
</P>
<P>
 "Are we taking too many trips to the well?" Berman asks, having heard the 
question often. "People asked that about 'Next Generation' too. But it's no 
riskier than any other film, maybe less. History has shown there is clearly an 
audience willing to embrace" a series of "Star Trek" TV spinoffs and sequels. 
</P>
<P>
 Berman takes pains to emphasize that the movie is not a "seventh sequel." It 
is, he says, the first film introducing the cast from the "Next Generation" TV 
series, although some characters, such as William Shatner's Capt. James Kirk, 
will make appearances. Paramount thinks the "Next Generation" cast will last 
through several more feature films. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Berman suspects that there will be an eighth "Star Trek" feature in 
the not-too-distant future, with work beginning on the conceptual stages 
shortly after the movie is released in November.

 Sounds like an evil sorcerer at work. 
</P>
<P>
 Walt Disney Co. this week began selling "The Return of Jafar," its highly 
publicized video sequel to the hit film "Aladdin." 
</P>
<P>
 No sooner did the hot-selling cassette go on sale than police and 
investigators for the Motion Picture Assn. of America raided an illegal 
duplication operation in Los Angeles where they found 73 videocassette 
recorders busily copying "Jafar." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Steve Feldstein, a spokesman at Disney's Buena Vista Home Video: "We've 
obviously got a big hit on our hands, and already they're ripping us off."

VIACOM INC. REPORTS BIG LOSS IN ITS 1ST QUARTER; EARNINGS: THE COMPANY'S 
ACQUISITION OF PARAMOUNT WAS THE BIGGEST FACTOR IN THE $431-MILLION DEFICIT. 
THE RESULTS WERE AS PROJECTED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Viacom Inc. on Friday reported a $431-million loss in the first quarter due to 
costs stemming from its acquisition of a controlling interest in Paramount 
Communications Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts saw no surprises in the results, which included one month of 
Paramount operations and $332 million in charges related to Viacom's March 
purchase of 50.2% of Paramount after its takeover battle with QVC Inc. In its 
announcement, Viacom reported revenue of $878.4 million for the quarter ended 
March 31. 
</P>
<P>
 Chief Financial Officer George S. Smith Jr. said in an interview that some of 
the charges involve devaluing some of Viacom's own programming assets in the 
wake of the Paramount merger. For example, he said, movies Viacom has been 
packaging together and selling may be worth less because the company will now 
put more effort into selling the more valuable films contained in Paramount's 
rich library. 
</P>
<P>
 Analyst Christopher Dixon at PaineWebber Inc. said the merger-related charges 
are in line with projections. Viacom and analysts also said the results are not 
comparable to those of previous periods because of the Paramount deal and that 
future results will be distorted for some time while Viacom acquires the 
remaining Paramount stake and digests the acquisition. 
</P>
<P>
 "The numbers are kind of irrelevant until you get into the fourth quarter and 
even into next year," said Jeffrey Logsdon, Seidler Cos. managing director. 
</P>
<P>
 Viacom said that, without the merger charges, its operations showed a 
$57-million profit. Its MTV Networks unit, which includes MTV, Nickelodeon/Nick 
at Nite and VH-1, was especially strong, with revenue climbing 30% and earnings 
from operations jumping 21% compared to a year earlier.  
</P>
<P>
 In the year-earlier quarter, Viacom as a whole reported a profit of $81 
million on revenue of $470.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Viacom's latest results included Paramount revenue of $375.8 million and a 
loss from operations of $41.1 million for Paramount, due to factors such as a 
seasonal drop in book sales by Simon & Schuster, whose educational book 
business is strongest in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Paramount Entertainment's loss from operations of $35 million reflects 
sluggish film operations in March, when the company released the box office 
disappointment "Jimmy Hollywood." 
</P>
<P>
 Viacom said it will report a pretax gain of about $267 million in the second 
quarter related to its April sale of its one-third interest in LifeTime 
Television to partners Capital Cities/ABC and Hearst Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 In a statement, Viacom Chief Executive Frank Biondi Jr. said the "main 
structural issues and associated costs are clearly behind us." 
</P>
<P>
 Chairman Sumner Redstone said the company is "already well-advanced in the 
implementation of the long-range strategies and opportunities" in the deal. 
</P>
<P>
 Viacom and cable giant Tele-Communications Inc. are in discussions to form a 
cable television partnership. Smith declined to comment on the status of those 
talks. 
</P>
<P>
 Viacom Class A shares closed down 25 cents at $29.50 on the American Stock 
Exchange.

 Fed Minutes Reveal Divisions: Federal Reserve Board policy-makers were divided 
on how much to raise short-term interest rates at their March meeting, but in 
the end voted 8 to 2 to boost rates by only a quarter of a percentage point, 
according to minutes of the meeting released Friday. Since then, the Fed has 
raised short-term rates twice, by another quarter of a point April 18 and by 
half a point earlier this week.

 U.S. Offers F-18s to Singapore: The Clinton Administration offered to sell 18 
McDonnell Douglas fighter jets and missiles in a deal valued at $1.5 billion, 
despite a controversy over the caning punishment of an American teen-ager in 
Singapore. The Pentagon informed Congress that Singapore is also considering 
whether to purchase the F-18s instead of buying a similar number of Lockheed 
Corp. F-16 fighter jets at the same cost.Timothy Chorba, the nominee as U.S. 
ambassador to Singapore, said the Administration intends to go ahead with the 
sale of jets to Singapore despite the flogging of the teen-ager. Chorba told 
the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that it was too soon to speculate on how 
the flogging of Michael Fay would affect relations between the two countries.

U.S.-JAPAN TALKS CONTINUE AS TRADE GAP GROWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press

<TEXT>
<P>
 As American and Japanese officials continued discussions Friday on resuming 
formal trade negotiations, Japan announced that its trade surplus, the source 
of friction with its trading partners, rose 8.1% in April. 
</P>
<P>
 The snowballing surplus reached $11.12 billion last month -- the fifth 
straight month of year-on-year rises in the overall surplus, Japan's Finance 
Ministry said. 
</P>
<P>
 The surplus with the United States, Japan's largest trading partner, rose for 
the second month in a row, surging 8.9% to $4.38 billion, the ministry said. 
</P>
<P>
 The growing trade imbalance was central to the "framework" trade negotiations 
between the United States and Japan, which collapsed in February. 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives of the two countries met in Washington on Thursday for the 
first time since the breakdown in an effort to restart the stalled talks. 
</P>
<P>
 After several hours of discussions Friday, talks were recessed so officials 
could consult with other members of their respective governments. A spokeswoman 
for U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor said the talks would continue 
today. 
</P>
<P>
 The negotiations broke down over U.S. demands for numerical benchmarks for 
measuring progress in opening Japan's markets. Japan says numerical targets 
would violate free-trade principles. 
</P>
<P>
 The Finance Ministry attributed the increase in the surplus in part to the 
Japanese yen's steep rise in recent months. 
</P>
<P>
 Ministry officials said that in yen terms, the overall surplus in April fell 
1.6% in its third straight monthly decline. The surplus with the United States 
dipped 0.9%. 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar averaged 104.43 yen in April, down 10% from a year earlier, they 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some economists believe a strong yen will cut Japan's surplus in the long run 
by making Japanese products more expensive and thus less competitive overseas, 
and by making imports cheaper for Japanese consumers. 
</P>
<P>
 But Japan's sagging economy has restricted consumer spending on both imported 
and domestic products. 
</P>
<P>
 Ministry officials said lower crude oil prices were another factor in the 
surplus. 
</P>
<P>
 With crude oil prices falling 21.2% to about $14.57 per barrel, oil imports 
fell 20.4% in value while the volume remained almost unchanged, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 Exports in April rose 7.1% from a year earlier to $32.89 billion, while 
imports increased 6.6% to $21.77 billion, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the export gainers in April were semiconductors and other electronics 
parts, up 31.8%; automobile parts, up 28.3%, and ships, up 62.4%, the report 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 For imports, semiconductors and other electronics parts rose 33.1%, clothing 
increased 19.3% and aircraft surged 140%, it said.

 Williams Cos. Rejects LDDS Buyout Offer: The company turned down the 
unsolicited $2-billion offer for its WilTel long-distance telephone subsidiary, 
saying the unit is too important to its future.Jackson, Miss.-based LDDS 
Communications Inc., the nation's fourth-largest long-distance company, had 
made the offer. A merger would have created a company that could begin to 
compete with AT&T, MCI and Sprint, which collectively account for about 86% of 
the long-distance market.

 Baby Bells to Compete: Southwestern Bell Corp. became the first Baby Bell to 
directly challenge another Bell over local phone service.Its target is a Bell 
Atlantic Corp. operation in suburban Washington. A Montgomery County cable TV 
system that Southwestern Bell purchased earlier this year asked the Maryland 
Public Service Commission for permission to offer local phone service. The 
commission could take months to issue a ruling. But the request signals the 
start of direct competition between the Baby Bells as phone and cable systems 
are improved for two-way voice, video and data signals.

 A bankruptcy judge in New York on Friday reaffirmed R.H. Macy & Co.'s 
exclusive right to file a detailed bankruptcy reorganization plan, which 
officially puts a Federated Department Stores bid for control of Macy on hold. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the ruling by Judge Burton R. Lifland, only Macy can submit a detailed 
reorganization plan to creditors between now and Aug. 1.Macy, Federated and a 
group of Macy bondholders had filed preliminary reorganization plans with the 
court May 9. Lifland ruled Friday that Macy has made enough progress in 
negotiations with creditors to earn the right to submit a more detailed plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources close to negotiations said Friday that neither Macy's nor Federated's 
preliminary reorganization bids have adequate creditor support. 
</P>
<P>
 Federated has informed creditors that it is willing to sweeten its May 9 
preliminary offer for control of Macy, according to sources. Macy would be 
expected to counter a new Federated offer. 
</P>
<P>
 Macy, whose holdings include the Bullock's and I. Magnin department store 
chains, is expected to file a detailed plan soon and will then try to get the 
creditor support necessary for court approval of it.  
</P>
<P>
 If Macy is unable to obtain adequate creditor support by the Aug. 1 deadline, 
the court could ask Federated or other interested parties to submit rival 
plans.

'COPS' HITS STREETS OF L.A.; THE FOX SHOW HAD BEEN TRYING TO VIDEOTAPE THE 
CITY'S POLICE IN ACTION FOR YEARS, BUT THEN-CHIEF GATES SAID NO. NOW THAT 
WILLIAMS IS IN CHARGE, THE CAMERAS ARE ON.

 Over six seasons and nearly 200 episodes, Fox's TV show "Cops" has featured 
police departments in cities across the nation, from Las Vegas to Washington to 
New York, and countries around the world, from Russia to Britain to Bolivia. 
But never had the cinema verite series, with offices in Los Angeles, videotaped 
the police department in its own back yard. 
</P>
<P>
 Though not for a lack of trying. The Los Angeles Police Department received 
repeated requests from "Cops" producers to tag along with officers on the beat, 
and turned them all down. The department was reluctant to allow TV programs to 
record its daily activities for commercial purposes, a long-standing policy 
upheld over the years by then-chief Daryl Gates. 
</P>
<P>
 But there's a new chief in town, Willie Williams, who is working hard to 
overcome image problems that occurred under Gates' watch. "Cops" had shot eight 
episodes in Philadelphia when Williams was police chief there, and a few months 
ago the producers appealed to him in a personal letter. 
</P>
<P>
 Now there are six camera crews roving Los Angeles, each one paired with 
officers from the Los Angeles Police Department or the Los Angeles County 
Sheriff's Department, which has participated with "Cops" before. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are are trying to find every avenue we can to open up the LAPD and allow 
the public to see exactly what goes on in the organization, what makes police 
officers tick and how they do their jobs," said Cmdr. David Gascon, who was 
made commanding officer of the community affairs group by Williams in 1992. "We 
don't feel there's anything to fear by letting the public look at L.A. police 
officers doing their job." 
</P>
<P>
 The first Los Angeles "Cops" episode was rushed out last Saturday night for 
the May ratings sweeps, with a car chase in North Hollywood, a foot chase in 
the Foothill Area and a man waving a gun on Hollywood Boulevard. Another one 
will air tonight, and the rest will be saved for the new season in late summer. 
</P>
<P>
 "The department, since the Rodney King incident in particular, has had a very 
negative reputation, far more negative than the reality," said Gary Greenebaum, 
president of the Police Commission, a group of citizens appointed by the mayor 
to oversee the department. "At this juncture, it makes certain sense for the 
department to receive some positive coverage, and for people to understand the 
real-life problems police officers have to deal with every single day." 
</P>
<P>
 Not everyone is convinced that focusing the cameras on local cops is 
appropriate, however. Gates, who was police chief for 14 years before he 
retired under pressure in 1992, still believes that police officers have an 
obligation to protect the privacy of citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 "If someone broke into my house, and I called for help, and the police showed 
up with TV cameras, I would resent the hell out of that," he said. Even though 
"Cops" producers obtain signed releases from the subjects they videotape (or 
else electronically blur their faces), Gates said, "the pressure is there for 
those people to consent, because the police have allowed them to be there." 
</P>
<P>
 Although many other law enforcement agencies have praised "Cops" for giving 
the public a positive view of their job, Gascon and Lt. John Dunkin, the LAPD 
officer in charge of press relations, were both reluctant at first to work with 
the program. Gascon had turned down a request from "Cops" producers just last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Both of our views were that the program was too much about the chase, the 
fights, the kicking in doors, the bad guys being arrested," Gascon said. "It 
was too much of what is actually only a small portion of the police officer's 
daily routine. We thought it was too sensationalized -- kind of a highlights 
reel." 
</P>
<P>
 But at the urging of Williams, Gascon agreed to invite the "Cops" producers 
in, to learn if they were willing to present what the department considered an 
accurate depiction of its myriad activities. Most of what local officers do, 
said Gascon, is low-key: "We talk and talk and talk. We interact with people 
and solve problems." 
</P>
<P>
 The producers explained to Gascon that "Cops" has featured a range of police 
work in past episodes. So Gascon sat down with them to identify different 
aspects of the organization -- officer academy training, helicopter patrols, 
traffic units, scientific procedures, vice operations, specialized bunco and 
forgery investigations. The producers agreed to videotape all those activities, 
and they will run the footage they shoot by the Los Angeles Police Department 
for approval, which is standard procedure for the series. 
</P>
<P>
 (The episodes airing on Fox this month involve the more traditional street 
patrols because that's what the "Cops" crews shot first.) 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to his concern over privacy and commercial exploitation, Gates has 
a problem with TV camera crews because he believes they endanger officers and 
interfere with their work. He explained: "I still have trouble seeing cops go 
on a raid, and some cameraman from a TV program running after the cops. You 
can't help but put police officers in danger. There's lights all over the 
place." 
</P>
<P>
 John Langley, executive producer of "Cops," countered that his crews, which 
are on the road nine months a year, have extensive experience with police 
procedure. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our crews are very sensitive to victims," he said. "They certainly film 
perpetrators differently than victims. The mandate from my standpoint is: You 
do not add to the problem, and you do not become part of the story. If there's 
any kind of (dangerous situation), our crews are instructed to shut down and 
move out of the way. We're not there to become the story. The moment we become 
the story, we've failed. We want to record the story." 
</P>
<P>
 Frank Berry, executive director of the National Assn. for the Advancement of 
Colored People in Los Angeles, objects to "Cops" taping here for another 
reason: He does not believe that viewers are going to learn anything about how 
local officers treat minorities. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those of us who have witnessed the contact between law enforcement and 
citizens, particularly African American citizens, know that what's portrayed on 
the television version of 'Cops' is not real," he said. "It doesn't reflect the 
same attitude cops have when the camera is not there. In many cases, the cops 
are acting for the camera, trying to make it a P.R. (public relations) program 
to drum up support for law enforcement. That's not bad, but to portray law 
enforcement acting in a manner that's different than what they would do if the 
camera is not rolling is inappropriate." 
</P>
<P>
 Gascon noted, however, that times have changed, and police officers never know 
when a camera is pointed at them -- as the men arresting Rodney G. King 
discovered. 
</P>
<P>
 "We all have to realize that everything the Los Angeles police officer does in 
1994 is under a microscope anyway," he said. "Whether it's for television news 
or documentaries, or other police departments, or John Q. Citizen, we have to 
perform as though we are clearly on center stage, and that there are cameras 
out there watching every move." 
</P>
<P>
 * A Los Angeles edition of "Cops" airs at 8 tonight on Fox (Channels 11 and 
6).

THE UNSINKABLE ANGELA LANSBURY; TELEVISION: AFTER 10 YEARS AND MORE THAN 200 
CORPSES, NO ONE HAS BEEN ABLE TO KNOCK OFF 'MURDER, SHE WROTE,' POWERED BY 
YOU-KNOW-WHO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 They've electrocuted 'em, stabbed 'em, shot 'em, hanged, drowned, 
bow-and-arrowed and poisoned 'em, even clubbed 'em over the head with a frozen 
fish and then eaten the murder weapon for lunch. 
</P>
<P>
 But even after 10 years and more than 200 corpses, nothing has been able to 
murder "Murder, She Wrote." 
</P>
<P>
 This past season was supposed to be different. ABC tapped the greatest 
superhero of them all and two of the prettiest young stars on television to 
subdue it. NBC turned to none other than Steven Spielberg and a 
special-effects-packed underwater spectacular to give it a nice burial at sea. 
Fox threw one of the country's hottest comedians against it, hoping once and 
for all to slay it with laughs. 
</P>
<P>
 Even Angela Lansbury, the show's star and executive producer, who has enjoyed 
50 years of nearly uninterrupted success in show business, was worried. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought, boy, this is really some stiff competition," the show's 
68-year-old centerpiece said in a recent interview on the set of her series. "I 
figured we had to be prepared to take our lumps and just hope we could 
survive." 
</P>
<P>
 Her fears turned out to be unfounded, almost ludicrous. For the 1993-94 season 
that ended last month, "Murder, She Wrote" finished as the ninth most popular 
series in television and the highest-rated drama in prime time. ABC's "Lois & 
Clark: The New Adventures of Superman" finished 64th, Spielberg's "seaQuest 
DSV" on NBC came in 82nd, and Fox's "Martin," starring Martin Lawrence, was 
85th. 
</P>
<P>
 "To my amazement, we were never threatened," Lansbury said. "And this is the 
second time Steven Spielberg has gone up against us" -- he was executive 
producer of NBC's "Amazing Stories" back in 1985-86. "It may be his year, but I 
guess this isn't his time slot." 
</P>
<P>
 "Murder, She Wrote," which has always benefited from the lead-in of "60 
Minutes" -- the second highest-rated prime-time series again this season -- did 
see its ratings slide a few years ago when Lansbury, wanting to work less, 
disappeared entirely from many episodes. ABC's "Funniest Home Videos" 
skyrocketed into the Top 10. 
</P>
<P>
 When Peter S. Fischer, who had guided the series as executive producer for the 
first seven years, decided to leave, Lansbury opted to take control. Ever 
since, almost miraculously -- because usually once an old show starts to 
decline, it rarely turns itself around -- the series has regained its 
dominance. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's really only one explanation for it and it's her," said Bruce 
Lansbury, the show's supervising producer, pointing across the room at his 
sister.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's Angie and her expression of Jessica Fletcher as a real human being, 
someone people trust and have confidence in, a mature woman who is up with the 
times," he continued. "The mystery is the fun part, the puzzle part, and for us 
it's the repetition of the familiar, which television really thrives on. You 
find a good joke and you play it every week. But really, much bigger than our 
format, it's the star." 
</P>
<P>
 Angela Lansbury, ever the gracious and modest host, blushes at such praise. 
She insists that "Murder, She Wrote" has become a Sunday night habit for 
millions of Americans simply because they love a good mystery. 
</P>
<P>
 But, really, how many mysteries can one woman solve? 
</P>
<P>
 After 10 years, both Bruce and Angela Lansbury concede it's tough to come up 
with fresh stories. It's not so much that they've run out of ways to kill 
people -- Bruce Lansbury said he has a list in his office with all the possible 
variations. The trick is finding a new arena in which to dump the body. 
</P>
<P>
 Coming up with new settings, they agreed, is what makes it possible to go on. 
Just this season, Jessica Fletcher has unraveled mysteries within the worlds of 
art galleries, classical music, theater, pigeon racing, NASA, interactive video 
games, a museum of cultural history, psychiatry, mining, restaurants, a TV 
cooking show, horse racing, illegal gambling, celebrity magazines, deep-sea 
diving, vampires -- yes, vampires -- and she's happened upon homicides in Hong 
Kong, Amsterdam and Ireland.  
</P>
<P>
 After all the corpses Jessica has run into over the years, Lansbury thinks 
it's funny that the other characters don't run for their lives the minute she 
walks into their world. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess they don't know what's coming," she said, "but that's what keeps it 
from getting boring for me after all these years. Every eight days I get to 
work with an entirely new group of actors in a new setting. It's not like I'm 
stuck in the same old place day after day, even if I do have to find a corpse 
everywhere I go." 
</P>
<P>
 Once the star approves of the setting for a story, her brother and his writers 
go to work with their formula. Jessica always spots a telling clue -- often one 
as obscure as ashes from a cigar or a missing button on a jacket -- that no one 
else in the story sees. Then, the writers will throw in some misdirection, 
providing motives and evidence that seem to implicate someone else. Then, 
always, they write a "gotcha" scene in which Jessica confronts the real killer 
and explains to him or her and the audience how she figured it all out. 
</P>
<P>
 Interwoven with the mystery, Bruce Lansbury said, is some kind of human drama 
-- a love story or family feud, often with characters much younger than the 
star -- that helps add both false leads to the mystery and depth to Jessica 
Fletcher's life. 
</P>
<P>
 Bruce Lansbury said: "We did at one time go overboard with string bikinis last 
year and we pulled back on Angela's orders, but we do try to find a young love 
story to tell in every show." 
</P>
<P>
 "I used to battle a lot with the old executive producer to keep (Jessica) 
current," Angela Lansbury said. "I said, 'Don't let her become an old 
fuddy-duddy and fall back on her own generational stuff and attitudes. And what 
I found is that people love her energy and ability to keep up, to realize that 
the future can be as exciting as the past. This championing of that generation 
has really paid off." 
</P>
<P>
 Lansbury doesn't know how much longer she can keep it up. She will star in and 
oversee at least one more full season, starting this fall, but after that, 
"Murder, She Wrote" is likely to live on as periodic two-hour movies, like 
"Columbo." 
</P>
<P>
 Lansbury, who began her career in the classic film "Gaslight" at 18 and became 
the Broadway star of "Mame" and "Sweeney Todd," said she often misses the 
theater. But she added that she does not regret giving up that life for the 
grind of episodic television 10 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "Never," she said. "If you have the ability to reach as many people as we do 
every Sunday night and to give as much pleasure and entertainment to that 
number of people and to know that they really benefit from it, that's really an 
incredible gift to have been able to share."

'SHARING THE DELIRIUM' OF AIDS; THEATER: A NEW COLLECTION OF PREDOMINANTLY 
ACTIVIST-ORIENTED STAGE WORKS ILLUSTRATES 'THE DIVISION BETWEEN FIRST- AND 
SECOND-GENERATION AIDS PLAYS,' THE BOOK'S EDITOR SAYS. SIX OF THE SEVEN ARE BY 
WEST COAST WRITERS.

 Even though California has played a major role in shaping some of the most 
important plays and musicals of recent seasons, the West is seldom hailed as a 
hub of theatrical innovation. Yet when it comes to theater about AIDS, Los 
Angeles artists seem to dominate the genre. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sharing the Delirium: Second Generation AIDS Plays and Performances," a 
Heinemann paperback edited by Therese Jones, is a collection of edgy, 
predominantly activist-oriented recent stage works. 
</P>
<P>
 Six of the book's seven entries are by West Coast writers. What's more, four 
of the plays (Michael Kearns' "Myron, A Fairy Tale in Black and White"; James 
Carroll Pickett's "Queen of Angels"; Wendell Jones/David Stanley/Robert Berg's 
"AIDS! The Musical!"; Tim Miller's "My Queer Body" ) premiered at Highways in 
Santa Monica, the performance venue that Miller co-founded in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones, a humanities professor at the University of Colorado, will be present 
when several of these L.A. authors read from their works in "Sharing the 
Delirium" tonight at A Different Light bookstore in West Hollywood. A similar 
reading will take place at Highways in Santa Monica on July 11. 
</P>
<P>
 The book's table of contents might seem overly skewed toward one community of 
artists, but the author says that happened without design. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't set out with a plan to include predominantly L.A. writers," says 
Jones, who didn't know any of the authors prior to her script search. "What I 
hoped was to bring together the most recent and radical expressions of AIDS, 
and as it happened, most of those originated on the West Coast. It seemed to be 
the site of the most experimental, confrontational, political and inventive 
AIDS drama." 
</P>
<P>
 These are in-your-face plays, not the kind of fare most publishers solicit. 
"It's difficult to get a play that is not a Broadway hit into print, so that's 
the first piece of good news," says Pickett, who co-founded the organization 
Artists Confronting AIDS with Kearns in 1984. (The group will receive a portion 
of the income from "Sharing the Delirium.") 
</P>
<P>
 "The work is recorded and in a version approved by the playwright," Pickett 
continues. "For me, there's a sense that it will become part of the complete 
record of who I was and what I did while I was here on the planet." 
</P>
<P>
 For Jones, the collection also illustrates the evolution of AIDS theater since 
the pioneering works of the mid-1980s. "The division between first- and 
second-generation AIDS plays is more complex than the practical chronological 
marker of the 1980s and '90s," she says. "Second-generation AIDS theater has a 
strong element of comedy." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet humor isn't the only distinguishing characteristic. "First-generation 
plays like 'As Is' and 'The Normal Heart' were more traditional in form and 
definitely more sentimental," says Jones. "They were educationally driven. They 
disseminated information about AIDS to the gay community, as well as to the 
straight community about gays." 
</P>
<P>
 Early AIDS plays also had a different relationship to the pre-plague past. "In 
the first generation, there is a nostalgic reconstruction of life before the 
epidemic that seems to be missing from second-generation AIDS theater," says 
Jones. "That nostalgic reconstruction is meaningless now." 
</P>
<P>
 Jones also argues that early AIDS drama was given to sympathy-evoking 
strategies. "Another first-generation characteristic is the way in which the 
disease itself is featured or characterized," she says. "In a first-generation 
play, AIDS becomes a mechanism for humanizing or redeeming the gay character." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, not everyone is convinced that the distinction between first- and 
second-generation AIDS plays is viable. "Well, it sounds more like a marketing 
technique to me than a philosophy," says playwright Pickett. "I know what they 
mean, but I never set out to write a 'second-generation AIDS play.' " 
</P>
<P>
 What is clear, however, is that works in which AIDS figures prominently have 
come to constitute a significant wave of defiant artistic energy, much of it 
coming from L.A. In this way, the theater has become a weapon in an ongoing 
battle of resistance. 
</P>
<P>
 "Historians and scientists are turning away from using a plague model to 
understand and define AIDS and turning toward a chronic disease model," says 
Jones. "These plays are about living with a chronic disease." 
</P>
<P>
 And they are also, perhaps inevitably, about living on beyond whatever toll 
that disease takes. "It will be a record," says Pickett. "We were here. There 
were good times and bad." 
</P>

THEATER REVIEWS; 'ALONE TOGETHER': HEAVY ON THE FLUFF; THE WESTMINSTER 
COMMUNITY PRODUCTION TAKES THE LOW ROAD IN A STORY OF ADULT CHILDREN RETURNING 
TO THE NEST. THE SITCOM STYLE AND ANTICS RENDER THE WHOLE MEANINGLESS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Lawrence Roman's mid-'80s sitcom "Alone Together" had some serious things to 
say about the then-new trend of grown children returning to the nest. A decade 
later, economics have made it even more serious. 
</P>
<P>
 In his production at Westminster Community Theatre, director Edward J. Steneck 
plays down the serious side and allows his cast to revel in the sitcom mode, 
which not only unbalances the text, but makes it all look a little meaningless. 
</P>
<P>
 George (Tony Grande) and Helene (Beth Titus) have seen the last of their three 
sons off to college and are ready for some prime-time fulfillment and a little 
foolin' 'round.  
</P>
<P>
 Before they can get off the starting line, son Michael (Jon Dolton) returns 
from a high-paying position at MIT, his poor little insecure tail between his 
legs. Then son Elliot (Walter DuRant) drops in, tossed out by his wife. 
</P>
<P>
 To complicate things in the sitcom manner, a freewheeling young woman 
(Victoria Allison), sent by college-bound Keith (Joe Hollinshead), arrives to 
rent the remaining bedroom. 
</P>
<P>
 There is comedy, to be sure: the sugarcoating Roman uses to get his audience 
to swallow his sociological pill. 
</P>
<P>
 But no one in the cast has taken much time to development a full, honest 
characterization, the depth that makes even the lightest of comedies come to 
life. They skim along the surface of the script like it was so many episodes of 
"Ozzie and Harriet" gone awry. 
</P>
<P>
 When Roman gets around to the serious stuff in Act II, actors and director are 
at a loss. They haven't laid the emotional foundations in Act I. 
</P>
<P>
 Physical shtick and goofball antics do a disservice to Roman's script. Light 
as it is, there is more there than there is on the Westminster stage. 
</P>

DOTSERO: INSPIRATION SPRINGS FROM COLORADO; JAZZ: THAT'S NOT THE ONLY THING THE 
BAND GOT FROM ITS HOME STATE. ITS NAME AND SOUND ARE ROOTED THERE, TOO. THE 
GROUP PLAYS RANDELL'S TONIGHT.

 The three guys at the core of Dotsero -- saxophonist Stephen Watts, his 
brother, guitarist David Watts and bassist Michael Friedman -- have been 
playing together since their junior-high-school days. But it took them several 
years, and no small amount of difficulty, to come up with a name that finally 
stuck. 
</P>
<P>
 "We started out as the Neighborhood," Stephen Watts said by phone earlier this 
week from his home outside Denver, "but didn't feel that was quite right, so we 
changed it to Sneakers. "Then we got a cease-and-desist letter from some band 
in California called Sneakers, so we thought about it and became New Shoes. 
Then we heard from a band in Portland called New Shoes, and that was that. We 
were starting to get a complex." 
</P>
<P>
 The three finally settled on Dotsero, the name of a tiny Rocky Mountain town 
where the Watts brothers went to fish. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was just a little place with a cinder-block factory and a trailer park," 
the saxophonist said, "and we were afraid that it wasn't memorable enough. But 
when we took the name we didn't realize how much history and folklore was 
associated with it." 
</P>
<P>
 The tag has worked out perfectly since it was adopted some eight years ago, 
though, Watts said, someone once came forward to tell them that there was an 
English band with the same moniker. "Probably just a bad joke," he said with a 
laugh. 
</P>
<P>
 They've heard various stories about the origin of the word. One tale has it 
that the town earned its name from being "dot zero" on a geological survey map. 
Another says that it's a Ute Indian word that roughly means "something unique" 
and was applied to the area because of its unusual thermal activity. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the origins of its name, Dotsero has carved out something unique of 
its own -- a sound that combines accessible rhythms, hummable melodies and 
cut-loose improvisations that fit the New Adult Contemporary label perfectly. 
Their 1991 album, "Jubilee," spent time as No. 1 on both Gavin and R&R radio 
play charts. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the band is back with "Out of Hand," a clean, mountain-high collection 
that looks to its Colorado homeland for inspiration. The group, which also 
includes keyboardist Tom Capek and drummer Larry Thompson, appears tonight at 
Randell's in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our music is very melody oriented," Watts said. "Usually in the realm of 
straight-ahead jazz, the melody was just an excuse to get to the improvisation. 
But we've tried to make the melody and the chords as important as the 
improvisation. 
</P>
<P>
 "The three of us all grew up in an era of rock and jazz, so it's only natural 
to combine the things we've been influenced by. We've listened to everyone from 
Boston (to) Heart and Kansas. I remember going to see all four of Joni 
Mitchell's concerts one summer when she had (bassist) Jaco Pastorius, 
(guitarist) Pat Metheny and (saxophonist) Michael Brecker in her band. It was 
like going to a clinic." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Watts says the band is definitely influenced by its home state. "I can't 
imagine living anywhere else," he said. "There's just something about it. One 
of the songs (from the new album), 'The View,' is inspired by Trail Ridge Road 
that cuts across Rocky Mountain National Park. It's a very special place where 
we go to relax and to get inspired." 
</P>
<P>
 But not all the stories behind the band's compositions are as spectacular. 
"I'm often inspired by my family, especially my son," said Watts, whose tune 
"Pickin' a Pumpkin" comes from a Halloween experience with his 6-year-old. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anybody who has kids can relate to the fact that a little boy growing up is 
one of the most humorous things there is. We live in a duplex next door to my 
wife's sister, who also has a son. So we're living a situation comedy around 
here. There's always some kind of funny adventure or crisis going on that 
involves those two." 
</P>
<P>
 David Watts contributed "The Choir Invisible," a title taken from a poem by 
Victorian novelist George Eliot. The guitarist went to great lengths to record 
the church-bell sounds that open and close the number. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bells are from the Augustana Lutheran Church in Denver," Stephen Watts 
said. "He wanted that exact sound so badly, he'd go out with microphones taped 
to boards tied to a rope which he tried to throw up over them to pulley the 
microphones up. He must have failed four or five times. 
</P>
<P>
 "We kept telling him there are plenty of sampled bells we could use," Watts 
said. "But he said, 'That's not the point; I want something real there.' Well, 
he finally got it to work, and the sound was perfect." 
</P>
<P>
 For an eclectic touch, the band also covers Fine Young Cannibals' "She Drives 
Me Crazy." 
</P>
<P>
 "Some radio (stations) have considered it too harsh for (New Adult 
Contemporary) play, and that's a little disappointing," he said. "But it's good 
if we can stir things up a little. When we first got it down, we played it at 
one of the Aspen dance clubs, and everybody really grooved to it."  
</P>
<P>
 That's the most important part of a Dotsero show, according to Watts: the 
audience. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not to knock the old-time jazzers," he said, "but they sometimes become so 
into their music that they put up an imaginary barrier between the audience and 
the music. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do the opposite," he said. "We try to draw the audience in with fun, have 
a performance that is visually enjoyable. From a personality standpoint, we 
want people to think, 'Shoot, these are the kind of guys we'd like to have a 
beer with.' " 
</P>
<P>
 * Dotsero plays tonight at Randell's, 3 Hutton Centre Drive, Santa Ana. 8, 
9:30 and 11 p.m. Table minimum varies. (714) 556-7700.

CANDIDATES WILL BE HEARD, BUT MIGHT NOT BE SEEN; TELEVISION: THE MAJOR 
COMMERCIAL STATIONS IN L.A. HAVE NO PLANS TO SHOW THE DEMOCRATIC GUBERNATORIAL 
DEBATE WEDNESDAY, BUT KABC-AM WILL AIR THE EVENT LIVE.

 What if they staged a major election debate and nobody watched? 
</P>
<P>
 That very well could be the case next week when the three major Democratic 
gubernatorial candidates square off in Los Angeles for the last of three 
debates before the June 7 primary election. 
</P>
<P>
 The debate between state treasurer Kathleen Brown, Insurance Commissioner John 
Garamendi and state Sen. Tom Hayden (D-Santa Monica) on Wednesday will air live 
at 1 p.m. on KABC-AM (790), but the seven major commercial television stations 
are not planning to broadcast the event or to become involved with staging any 
other debates between the candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the stations apparently have no plans to pick up a live feed of a 
San Francisco debate involving the same trio on Tuesday. That event is being 
televised live at 6 p.m. by San Francisco stations KRON-TV and KQED-FM. 
</P>
<P>
 (C-SPAN, the cable channel devoted to public affairs, may cover the Wednesday 
event in L.A.) 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at the local stations cite a variety of reasons for not broadcasting 
or staging a primary gubernatorial debate, ranging from economics to 
anticipated low viewer interest. The debates are also taking place during the 
critical May sweeps, in which ratings help determine advertising rates for the 
coming months, and the debates are not seen as a great viewer draw. 
</P>
<P>
 Many said they would be more interested in being involved in a debate between 
the Democratic and Republican gubernatorial front-runners before the November 
election. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision not to broadcast the primary debates was attacked by 
spokespersons for the candidates and other political experts who accused the 
local stations of placing a higher priority on covering sensational crime than 
government issues.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's just totally irresponsible for TV stations not to carry the debates," 
said Larry Berg, director of USC's Jesse Unruh Institute of Politics. "They're 
not living up to their responsibility to the public to give access to 
candidates who would be governing a state of 30 million people. They just 
operate on the assumption that people aren't interested. Maybe they're not 
interested because there's no coverage." 
</P>
<P>
 Duane Peterson, Hayden's campaign manager, said, "L.A. citizens are kept 
ignorant of politics in favor of endless coverage of the Menendez murder trial 
or other flashy but meaningless so-called news." 
</P>
<P>
 Hayden said the apparent lack of interest in the debates corresponds to the 
lack of coverage of state politics. He said the last time Los Angeles 
television stations had a correspondent based in the state capital was 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are networks in Los Angeles which will make millions of dollars off 
candidates peddling their 30-second promotional commercials, then they'll turn 
around and tell us it's not profitable to cover the debates," Hayden said. 
</P>
<P>
 Darry Sragow, Garamendi's campaign manager, said, "It's a real outrage. 
Viewers feel disconnected from candidates because they never hear or see any of 
them. It's a gross breach of the television industry's duty to cover politics." 
</P>
<P>
 While many stations declined to respond to the criticism, Alan Nesbitt, 
general manager of KABC-TV Channel 7, insisted that his station was interested 
in the gubernatorial race. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will be very interested in the debate between the two top nominees," 
Nesbitt said. "Also, we have covered this extensively. Viewers can get 
information from our newscasts. We have had all three of the candidates on our 
Sunday morning show, 'L.A. Extra.' There will be lots of debates and lots of 
different opportunities for viewers to see the candidates." 
</P>
<P>
 Bruce Cain, a political science professor at UC Berkeley, said he understood 
the stations' reluctance to carry the primary debates. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even presidential debates have attracted relatively minor audiences," Cain 
said. "Brown's (poll) numbers have been stable, so it's really not much of a 
race. So it's a matter of logic for the stations: Why should they carry 
something when there's not all that much at stake? But it's still sad when they 
treat it as a foregone conclusion." 
</P>
<P>
 Santo Iyengar, a professor of political science at UCLA, said, "In a perfect 
world, voters should have widespread opportunities to see these candidates 
debate. But it's a market-oriented society and stations have to be concerned 
about the bottom line."

NORTENOS AND ROCK: BLAZING A MUSICAL TRAIL; BAND: EAST L.A.'S BLAZERS MELD 
STYLES ON THEIR FIRST ALBUM, 'SHORT FUSE.' AND, AFTER SOME LOCAL GIGS, THEY'RE 
TOURING THE EAST COAST AND EUROPE.

<P>
 As a boy in the late '50s, Ruben Guaderrama, guitarist of the band the 
Blazers, found himself caught in the middle of an East L.A. musical generation 
gap. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was getting this great mix from both sides," says Guaderrama, 41, during an 
interview with him and guitarist Manuel Gonzales in the latter's Monterey Park 
home. "My older brothers, they'd be playing their records, their doo-wop stuff, 
and in the living room my mom would be playing mariachis and norten os ." 
</P>
<P>
 Now with the Blazers, he's updated that mix, blending the norten os and 
cumbias he heard at home with the blues-rock sounds of Jimi Hendrix and Cream 
that he and his band-mates listened to on the radio as teen-agers during the 
late '60s. 
</P>
<P>
 The Blazers, who perform tonight at the House of Blues, wear these roots-rock 
influences on their collective sleeve, but they soulfully craft them into a 
seamless whole. On "Short Fuse," the band's first album, it plays rocking, 
"Blazerized" versions of traditional Mexican tunes and adds a 
south-of-the-border rhythmic texture to its bluesy originals. 
</P>
<P>
 If the band's style and story sound a bit like that of Los Lobos, it's not a 
coincidence. Members of both bands grew up in the same neighborhood and often 
played together at parties and jam sessions. They remain friends, and Los 
Lobos' Cesar Rosas produced "Short Fuse" in his home studio. The Blazers have a 
rawer, less atmospheric sound than their more famous friends, but Guaderrama 
and Gonzales are happy with the comparison. 
</P>
<P>
 "People tell us we sound like (Los Lobos) when we do the rock stuff," 
Guaderrama says. "It's flattering because they think we can play that well. 
It's the East L.A. sound. We grew up learning to play 'Johnny B. Goode' in the 
same neighborhood." 
</P>
<P>
 Guaderrama and Gonzales, who co-write the band's songs and English lyrics, 
started playing together at parties and weddings when they graduated from high 
school in 1971. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were doing Chuck Berry songs, Beatles songs, all the rock 'n' roll stuff," 
Guaderrama says. "(Mexican music) was always in the back of our minds because 
we grew up listening to it. . . . At weddings, we'd play a cumbia and 'Johnny 
B. Goode' and we were in. Everybody from the old country dug it and (so did) 
all the kids." 
</P>
<P>
 Guaderrama and Gonzales played in a series of mostly short-lived bands, both 
together and apart, before forming the Blazers in 1990 with bassist Lee Stuart, 
who's from West Covina, and a drummer who was replaced two years ago by Ruben 
C. Gonzalez. With its current lineup, the band's energetic live shows at local 
bars started attracting attention, and it was handpicked by Bob Dylan to open 
one of his 1992 concerts at the Pantages Theater. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Blazers heard a rumor that Cambridge, Mass.-based Rounder Records was 
interested in signing them, they quickly started an impromptu write-in campaign 
targeting the independent roots music label. 
</P>
<P>
 "We made postcards with Rounder's address on them," Guaderrama says. "If 
somebody liked the music, we'd give them a postcard and say, 'Write to 
Rounder.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The company signed the Blazers a year ago, and last summer the band recorded 
"Short Fuse" with Rosas. Released in March, the album has sold almost 10,000 
copies, fairly respectable for a Rounder roots-rock act known mainly in Los 
Angeles and Austin, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
 Having recently returned from a short tour of the South, the Blazers will play 
some Los Angeles-area shows, including Jacks Sugar Shack on June 10 and the 
Palomino on June 25 in addition to the House of Blues tonight, before they go 
back on the road in July. This tour will take them to the East Coast and 
Europe, both for the first time, and the band hopes to win more fans outside of 
Los Angeles.  
</P>
<P>
 "The music business is so tough," Guaderrama says. "I don't know where we fit 
in. If we do fit in, I just hope people play it loud." 
</P>
<P>
 * The Blazers will play at the House of Blues , 8430 Sunset Blvd., tonight, 
opening a show also featuring C.C. Adcock and the Red Devils. The show starts 
at 8:30 p.m. Tickets are $15 and are available at the House of Blues or through 
Ticketmaster.

HE ENGINEERED SUCCESS OF CONFEDERATE RAILROAD; COUNTRY MUSIC: DANNY SHIRLEY 
STICKS CLOSE TO HIS ROOTS AND FINDS THE BIG TIME. BUT THAT NAME? IT'S 'BEEN A 
PLUS AND HAS BEEN VERY VALUABLE IN CREATING A MARKETABLE IMAGE.'

 "I don't give a damn about being politically correct," says a chuckling Danny 
Shirley, lead singer of the hot country band Confederate Railroad. 
</P>
<P>
 The band's badge of political incorrectness is its logo -- the Confederate 
flag. Keyboardist Chris McDaniel even wears a headband with the controversial 
symbol. 
</P>
<P>
 Isn't the band, which is headlining a country show tonight at Irvine Meadows 
Amphitheatre, playing into the hands of racists with that name and logo? 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not racists," says Shirley, bristling. "I don't think we attract 
racists either -- just people who like to drink beer and party and whoop it up. 
Being a redneck doesn't mean you're a racist. We were looking for a name that 
says we play Southeastern music. The name just helped get us some attention." 
</P>
<P>
 It's also caused some problems -- though, Shirley admits, fewer than he 
expected. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, there was that reception some senators gave for us in Washington 
because we were involved in this POW-MIA issue," Shirley recalls. "Some 
senators wouldn't come because they were bothered by our name. In terms of 
endorsements, I think the name would present a problem. I'm sure many companies 
would shy away from us because of our name. I don't think Coke or Pepsi or 
people like that would want us selling their products. On the whole, though, 
the name has been a plus and has been very valuable in creating a marketable 
image." 
</P>
<P>
 That image has helped boost the band to the big time. Its first album, 
"Confederate Railroad," which came out in 1992, has sold more than 1.6 million 
copies. Its second album, "Notorious," is off to an impressive start, with more 
than 500,000 sold in about two months. Though it's getting solid country 
airplay, such songs as "Elvis and Andy," "Trashy Women," "Redneck Romeo" and 
"Move Over Madonna" are closer to rollicking, '70s Southern rock. 
</P>
<P>
 Shirley, 37, has been playing this kind of music since he was a teen-ager back 
in his hometown, Chattanooga, Tenn. He recorded three solo albums in the '80s, 
but for small labels. 
</P>
<P>
 "Major labels thought I was poison," he recalls. "They didn't like my music 
and they didn't like the company I kept -- 'outlaws' like David Allen Coe and 
Johnny Paycheck. Nashville was scared of that kind of act in those days. They 
were looking for traditionalists -- people like Randy Travis and George Strait. 
They didn't want some guy playing barroom music." 
</P>
<P>
 Shifting to a Nashville-friendly style, he says, never even entered his mind.  
</P>
<P>
 "I would have sounded so fake," he says. "I just kept on playing my rowdy, 
bar-band music and the climate eventually changed in my favor. Radio stations 
that wouldn't play this kind of music five years ago are playing it now." 
</P>
<P>
 He signed as a solo artist with Atlantic Records in 1991, but argued that 
being part of a band made better commercial sense. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were too many solo singers out there already," he explains. "There was 
more of a void in the band category. I'd been playing with these guys since 
1981, so it was natural to include them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just didn't want to be just another clean-cut singer in a white hat or a 
black hat, singing some sad songs about losing your love, or other stuff like 
that. I'm a bar-band kind of a guy."  
</P>
<P>
 * Confederate Railroad plays with Little Texas, Patty Loveless and Boy Howdy

O.C. WOMAN IS ARRESTED IN TODDLER'S 1976 DEATH; INVESTIGATION: IRVINE WOMAN'S 
LOCAL CONFESSION ABOUT BABY'S INJURIES LED TO ILLINOIS INDICTMENTS, OFFICIALS 
SAY. 
</P>

<P>
 Police disclosed Friday that they had arrested an Irvine woman on charges of 
killing her adopted baby daughter 18 years ago in a case that authorities said 
only came to light when she told an Orange County social worker about it late 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Victoria Neal, described by Irvine police as a 44-year-old unemployed interior 
designer, was arrested at her Irvine home Thursday on the strength of Illinois 
indictments charging her with murder or voluntary manslaughter in the death of 
1-year-old Danielle Christine Neal, who died Sept. 2, 1976, at a Peoria, Ill., 
hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 The child, who apparently suffered fatal injuries while being violently 
shaken, was of Korean descent and had been adopted by Neal and her 
then-husband, Glenn Neal. The couple, who have a 14-year-old daughter born to 
them, subsequently moved to Orange County and were divorced last year. 
</P>
<P>
 In a telephone interview Friday, Tazewell County, Ill., prosecutor Kirk D. 
Schoenbein said Victoria Neal admitted to abusing Danielle in a meeting that 
she and her husband had with an Orange County social worker in October, 1993. 
Schoenbein said the woman stunned the social worker by blurting out that she 
was responsible for the baby's death in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
 "It appears that she's been wracked by a guilty conscience all these years," 
Schoenbein said. He said that Neal told the social worker that she had 
difficulty dealing with crying children, but there is no evidence that her 
14-year-old daughter was ever abused. The meeting with the social worker had 
been prompted by family problems related to the Neals' divorce. 
</P>
<P>
 The social worker reported Victoria Neal's admission to Irvine police, who 
forwarded the information to police in Morton, Ill., where the Neals lived at 
the time of the baby's death, Schoenbein said. Morton is about 10 miles from 
Peoria. 
</P>
<P>
 Illinois authorities reopened the investigation and were surprised to learn 
that Victoria Neal had admitted to a Wisconsin physician in 1980 that she had 
abused Danielle, as well as another Korean baby girl adopted by the couple in 
1979. The second child was 8 months old when she was taken to a Toledo, Ohio, 
hospital in 1979 with a brain hemorrhage, Schoenbein said. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Schoenbein, Victoria Neal told doctors in both instances that the 
girls had been injured in falls. Hospital officials in the case of the second 
child suspected abuse, however, and reported the couple to state authorities. 
The child was removed from the Neals' custody, but they were never charged. The 
baby recovered from her injuries, Schoenbein said. 
</P>
<P>
 "In 1980, she made a statement to the doctor that she abused her first two 
adopted children because she couldn't handle it when they became fussy," 
Schoenbein said. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the 1980 admission to the doctor, and evidence in 1976 that 
"Danielle's injuries were inconsistent with Neal's statements" to police, she 
was never charged until her arrest Thursday, the prosecutor said. He said he 
was "dumbfounded" that Neal was never charged in Danielle's death. In 1976, 
there was enough evidence to suggest that the child's death was not accidental, 
he added. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once we got the information from Irvine police, we looked at all the 
documents generated in the original investigation," Schoenbein said. "We had 
the police reports, X-rays and medical reports. We reviewed them and discovered 
that even then there was enough evidence of possible child abuse. I have no 
idea why she was never charged." 
</P>
<P>
 A coroner's report at the time listed the baby's cause of death as a head 
injury and edema, an excessive accumulation of fluid in body tissues. The 
child's body was exhumed last November and another autopsy was done, Schoenbein 
said. He declined to discuss the findings from the second autopsy. The girl was 
reburied, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Neal was being held on $100,000 bail at Orange County Jail. A hearing is 
scheduled for Monday, when she will have an opportunity to waive or contest her 
extradition to Illinois. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Schoenbein, Victoria and Glenn Neal met with a county social 
worker last year because "their teen-aged daughter was having behavioral 
problems stemming from their divorce." 
</P>
<P>
 Glenn Neal could not be reached for comment, and authorities said Victoria 
Neal was in the jail infirmary and could not be interviewed.

 Court documents showed that the couple were married July 8, 1969, and 
separated in July 31, 1992, citing irreconcilable differences. The marriage was 
dissolved in late 1993. According to court records, Victoria Neal was employed 
at a hospital at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine Police Lt. Sam Allevato said the couple's daughter was living with 
Victoria Neal at the time of her mother's arrest. However, court records filed 
on April 23, 1993, showed that Glenn Neal was awarded custody of the teen-ager. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time of the baby's death in 1976, Glenn Neal worked for the Campus 
Crusade for Christ at Bradley University and at Caterpillar Inc. in Peoria, 
officials in Illinois said. Victoria Neal did not work at the time.

TWO RIGHTEOUS SIDES IN DEVILISH DISPUTE; SCHOOLS: MISSION VIEJO HIGH MASCOT 
THAT WON'T GO AWAY REAPPEARS IN SUIT PITTING STUDENT'S RIGHTS VERSUS TEACHER'S. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Problems between teachers and students are as old as Aristotle, but in this 
affluent South County community, the conflict has taken on a distinct 1990s 
spin. 
</P>
<P>
 In a dispute that combines religious symbolism with a long-running local 
drama, a high school teacher claims to be taking a stand for his colleagues' 
right to discipline students without fear of retaliation. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mission Viejo High School teacher, Terry Sheppard, might end up fighting a 
solitary battle against the student, who claims he is protecting his 
constitutional right to free expression. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm afraid this thing won't go away," said Sheppard, 48. "I would be much 
happier if it were over. It's an incredible distraction; it's taking quite a 
toll. But I refuse to give in." 
</P>
<P>
 "We're in it until we win," said Tamera Carlucci, the student's mother. 
</P>
<P>
 It all began innocently enough, when Jeremy Carlucci enrolled in Sheppard's 
prestigious Communication Arts and Technology Academy at Mission Viejo High for 
the 1991-92 academic year. 
</P>
<P>
 To hear Sheppard tell it, Carlucci posed an immediate problem. Strong-willed 
and defiant, the boy often showed up late, Sheppard said. During his second 
year in the class last October, Carlucci suddenly got up and left one day, 
Sheppard said. 
</P>
<P>
 The teacher referred the matter to the school's academic dean, who sentenced 
Carlucci to three days of study hall -- a penalty known as an in-house 
suspension. Soon afterward, Carlucci transferred to El Toro High School, where 
he hopes to graduate next month. 
</P>
<P>
 Carlucci, 18, who plans to enlist in the Air Force in July, tells a different 
story, one he is backing up with lawyers who will make their arguments during 
an Orange County Superior Court trial scheduled for August. 
</P>
<P>
 Last November, Carlucci filed suit against Sheppard, accusing him of violating 
his constitutional liberties. Carlucci says the entire affair stems from his 
decision to wear the school's original mascot design -- a fierce red devil, 
complete with horns -- on his varsity letter jacket, and of Sheppard's 
opposition. 
</P>
<P>
 Eight years ago, after pressure from conservative Christian parents who had 
campaigned against it, the original design was officially banned at the school, 
whose problems with the Diablo logo have taken on biblical ramifications. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources close to the case say the Carlucci family wants $15,000 from the 
Saddleback Valley Unified School District, which, they say, is inclined to pay 
at least a third of that sum to rid itself of the lawsuit. The suit names the 
school principal, the school district and the entire school board as 
co-defendants. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard C. Gilbert, the Carlucci family attorney, said that $15,000 is "within 
$2,000" of the money his clients are seeking, excluding legal costs.  
</P>
<P>
 But Sheppard refuses to go along. "I did nothing wrong. Nothing," he said, 
noting that he has hired a lawyer at $200 an hour, intending not to be a party 
to any out-of-court settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 "I fear I'm at the heart of a national trend," Sheppard added. "Students and 
parents using violence or litigation to get back at teachers in otherwise 
menial disputes. It's ridiculous and disgusting." 
</P>
<P>
 Patsy Barry, the school's representative to the Saddleback Valley Educators' 
Assn., said Sheppard's fellow teachers are appalled at the suit, which she 
labeled frivolous. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here was a teacher doing his job by the book," Barry said, adding that if the 
district fails to pay Sheppard's legal fees, state and national teachers' 
groups can be expected to do so. "This lawsuit has its own hidden agenda. It's 
tied into the fact that a small group of parents won't let the issue of this 
Diablo mascot die. And it's stupid." 
</P>
<P>
 Lynn Ohman, director of legal services for the National Education Assn., said 
her office has seen an increase in lawsuits of all kinds against teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're seeing these types of cases all over the country," including a 10% 
increase in cases involving allegations of sexual misconduct. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheppard says he was told by the school district's attorney that, should he 
reject a settlement and go his own way, "my legal defense would not be covered 
. . . I would bear the cost entirely." 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys for the district could not be reached for comment. Gilbert, 
Carlucci's attorney, said Sheppard's rejection of a potential settlement would 
mean nothing, calling it "a moot point." Once his client is paid, Gilbert said, 
the Carluccis would consider the matter closed, and any lingering issue would 
be between Sheppard and his employer. 
</P>
<P>
 Carlucci claims Sheppard suppressed his freedom of speech and expression by 
sending him to the school principal and the wrestling coach "for a scolding" 
solely because he wore "the traditional school mascot on his clothing," the 
lawsuit says. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Carlucci's lawsuit, Sheppard "restricted, prevented, deprived and 
denied (Carlucci) of his right to free speech and freedom of expression, 
guaranteed by the First Amendment." 
</P>
<P>
 Further complicating the issue is the fact that Sheppard is an outspoken 
Christian. But with a gray beard punctuated by a mane of salt-and-pepper hair 
knotted in a trendy pony tail, he hardly fits the stereotype of an evangelist, 
or, for that matter, a teacher. 
</P>
<P>
 He says he doesn't belong to any religious group or even a church, but "my 
personal point of view is that the devil is a religious symbol. And if there is 
separation between church and state, why should this Judeo-Christian symbol be 
allowed any more than Moses, Christ on a crucifix or the Star of David?" 
</P>
<P>
 Sheppard, who supervised a student election in which a whimsical, or benign, 
imp-like devil was voted in to replace the fierce devil as the school's 
official logo, had asked Carlucci to explain the reappearance of the former 
mascot on his lapel. Parents who favor the design have refused to let it die, 
and the student election seems -- in some ways -- to have made matters worse. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheppard concedes that, a few days before Carlucci left class, they clashed 
bitterly over the design on his $199 letter jacket. He acknowledges sending 
Carlucci to the office of Principal Bob Metz, who told Carlucci he could wear 
anything he wanted as long as it steered clear of symbols relating to alcohol, 
drugs or gangs. 
</P>
<P>
 Metz granted his permission even though the fierce devil was no longer part of 
the school's nomenclature, Sheppard said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the suit, Carlucci claims that Sheppard and other school officials 
"unlawfully reduced the grades of students" and "threatened to reduce 
(Carlucci's) grades" if he failed to comply with the school's "unlawful 
censorship policies." 
</P>
<P>
 Sheppard adamantly denies making any threats and says his problems with 
Carlucci had, in fact, "nothing to do" with a devil design, fierce or 
otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe the devil issue was just a smoke screen and that I was, in fact, 
set up," Sheppard said. "I have many students who have demonic depictions on 
clothing and who prefer the fierce devil (design) and I've had no problems with 
any of them." 
</P>
<P>
 Sheppard believes Carlucci was being influenced by a vocal coalition that 
still objects to the exorcism of the fierce devil. 
</P>
<P>
 But Tamera Carlucci, 36, the student's mother and a co-plaintiff in the case, 
says the fierce devil is not only at the heart of the lawsuit but at the core 
of Sheppard's difficulties with her son. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jeremy was called down in front of (Sheppard's) class," she said. "He was 
yelled at, humiliated and sent to the principal's office solely because of the 
devil on his jacket. He was then accosted again when he came back to class from 
the principal's office." 
</P>
<P>
 Carlucci's mother concedes that Jeremy erred in leaving class abruptly, but 
denied Sheppard's claim that her son posed a discipline problem throughout 
1991-92. She says he left Sheppard's fifth-period class -- his last of the day 
-- in a hurry to get to the school's automotive shop to have his car repaired. 
</P>
<P>
 "He never had a single tardy!" she said. "And his attendance record was 
perfect from the beginning of (1991-92) to when he left class early," in 
October, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Principal Metz declined to discuss Carlucci's record or any other aspect of 
the case, referring all questions to the district's attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
 Tamera Carlucci says her son decided to transfer because he found Sheppard 
inflexible. She says she viewed the teacher's demand that Jeremy be placed 
under a strict behavioral contract as "unthinkable." The conflict posed a 
dilemma for Carlucci, his mother said, because Sheppard's class is the only one 
at the school that offers training in television production, a career he would 
like to pursue. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources close to the case say the school has offered $5,000 to settle the 
case, which leaves Sheppard stewing in anger. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the district could settle this for (Carlucci's) attorney's fees, then as 
far as I'm concerned, the issue should die," he said. "But if even one penny 
goes to Jeremy Carlucci, I feel a serious wrong has been committed here. I 
would then be compelled to take a stand for every classroom teacher in America. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's too late for me as an educator to make a difference in the life of 
Jeremy Carlucci, but I have plenty of other students. I don't want them to 
believe that you can do anything you want, then turn around and make false 
allegations and misuse the justice system to make money. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's extortion, pure and simple, and I won't have it," he said. "How can I 
possibly accept that? How could I live with myself?"

FAMILIES WANT ANSWERS TO MEN'S DEATHS; ACCIDENT: CAL/OSHA HAS ISSUED SANCTIONS, 
BUT QUESTIONS REMAIN AS TO WHAT CAUSED THE FIRE THAT KILLED TWO WORKERS AT AN 
O.C. SEWAGE TREATMENT SITE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 When they buried Robin Miller and Joe Patterson on Valentine's Day, a lone 
Harley-Davidson led a procession of five white limousines and more than 150 
cars from Upland's First Presbyterian Church. 
</P>
<P>
 At the grave, in a rousing tribute to the pair's deep friendship and 
spontaneity, the families chose an untraditional but appropriate musical 
send-off: "Born to be Wild." 
</P>
<P>
 "They were such good men who loved life," said Jackie Venezio, Patterson's 
mother. "When it was over, I think everyone who knew them died a little bit 
inside that day. I know we have lost a big part of our lives." 
</P>
<P>
 It has been more than three months since that emotional service, and the 
family's grief is now mixed with anger. Venezio and other family members say 
they still don't know what caused the flash fire that left the two young 
contract workers fatally injured, ankle-deep in sludge at a Huntington Beach 
sewage treatment plant. 
</P>
<P>
 The families' questions have become even more persistent since last week, when 
the California Occupational Safety and Health Administration issued serious 
safety-code sanctions against the Orange County Sanitation Districts and the 
Ontario-based engineering firm, Pascal and Ludwig, where the two men worked. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal/OSHA officials also are expected to turn over results of a separate 
criminal investigation to the Orange County district attorney's office next 
week. On Friday, county Supervisor William G. Steiner, one of the sanitation 
agency's 42 directors, acknowledged that he has met recently with district 
attorney's investigators to discuss his concerns about the incident. 
</P>
<P>
 But the lingering questions about the incident have especially haunted the 
family members, who last week filed wrongful death claims against the county's 
sanitation districts. 
</P>
<P>
 Patterson, 32, was a gregarious man who had a promising career as a supervisor 
with the engineering firm. A bull of a man, Miller, 37, was a hard worker, and 
family members say he attended safety seminars regularly. 
</P>
<P>
 Both men were getting out of broken marriages, had become fast friends on the 
job and planned to become roommates. Miller also was a dad, the father of an 
11-year-old girl named Lacey. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel mad," Lacey said earlier this week, tugging at the high school 
graduation ring left by her father and brushing away tears. "I'm mad because 
this was not supposed to happen. It should never have happened." 
</P>
<P>
 Venezio said she can't shake the terrible memory of seeing her only son after 
the fire, as he clung to life in a hospital intensive-care unit. 
</P>
<P>
 "For days, my son's burned face was wrapped in bandages. All you could see 
were his eyes and a blister that no one could tend to," she said. "When he 
died, for a month, I went to sleep thinking about those eyes and that blister. 
. . . We have to get to the bottom of (this)." 
</P>
<P>
 For both families, the bad news came Feb. 1, the day Patterson was supposed to 
close escrow on a new house that he and Miller planned to share. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember he was so jazzed that day," Patterson's father, Andy, said. 
"Everything was just beginning to come together for him. He had the house, a 
boat and his next toy was going to be a Harley-Davidson." 
</P>
<P>
 By 11:30 a.m., Andy Patterson and the others were rushing to UCI Medical 
Center in Orange where sanitation officials said his son, Miller and another 
man were taken with serious burns suffered in a work-related accident. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I got to the room, I walked right by his bed," Andy Patterson said. "I 
didn't even know he was my son. He was that bad off." 
</P>
<P>
 He said the skin on his son's arms was literally raw, his shoulder-length hair 
burned away. Andy Patterson said his son, unable to speak, flashed a "thumbs 
up" sign and occasionally nodded his head. 
</P>
<P>
 On a nearby bed, Miller lay in equally grave condition, his eyes swollen shut, 
completely unable to communicate with family members. 
</P>
<P>
 "His skin was pink and bloody," said Georgianne Miller, his ex-wife. "I could 
tell it was Rob, but it really didn't look like Rob." 
</P>
<P>
 For days after the incident, family members and co-workers kept a vigil at the 
hospital's intensive-care unit. Miller died Feb. 3, Patterson the next day. 
</P>
<P>
 It was during those hours of waiting that the families began to hear the first 
painful details from co-workers and other witnesses about how the men were 
injured. 
</P>
<P>
 The day of the fire, both men had been assigned to install a valve inside a 
seven-foot-deep concrete channel at the Huntington Beach sewage treatment plant 
at Brookhurst Street and Pacific Coast Highway. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller was working inside the channel operating a hammer, similar to a 
jackhammer, while Patterson and another worker, Richard Holm, remained 
aboveground. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanitation districts officials have declined to discuss the accident, citing 
the ongoing investigations. But family members and their attorney said they 
have pieced together this account of what happened: 
</P>
<P>
 Within minutes of starting work that day, the workers felt a small "explosion" 
and heard Miller's screams. Patterson reportedly turned to find his best friend 
engulfed in flames and jumped into the trench to help. 
</P>
<P>
 As the two struggled to extinguish the flames, which by then had jumped to 
Patterson's hair and clothing, Holms was engaged in a fight of his own to help 
his colleagues. It was not long before Holms was burned too; he survived. 
</P>
<P>
 Andy Patterson said witnesses told him that the fire seemed to come from an 
invisible source until the flames torched the workers' clothing and hair, only 
to burn itself out. When it was over, Andy Patterson said, the workers were 
amazingly able to climb a ladder out of the trench and seat themselves on 
buckets, where they waited for help. 
</P>
<P>
 Even with their injuries, family members were told, one of the friends urged 
paramedics to take the other for treatment first. 
</P>
<P>
 "They loved each other," Andy Patterson said, brushing away tears. "They 
really did." 
</P>
<P>
 Since that day, the families, sanitation workers and county officials have 
been awaiting news about the exact cause of the fire. But so far, officials 
have not been able to pinpoint the source. 
</P>
<P>
 In Cal/OSHA's listing of safety infractions issued last week against the 
sanitation districts and the engineering firm, investigators alluded only to a 
possible cause in one of its sanctions against the sanitation agency. 
</P>
<P>
 In the report to the county, investigators stated that Patterson, Miller and 
other workers had "no knowledge" that high levels of enriched oxygen were 
present in the area where the fire occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said the combustible mixture is used in the sewage treatment 
process, but it was not known whether a possible spark from Miller's hammer 
could have ignited the gas, causing the fire. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal/OSHA investigators said in the report that the sanitation agency "failed 
to inform the contractor" of the potentially hazardous conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 Pascal and Ludwig was fined $11,150 for four safety code violations. Claremont 
attorney Greg Hafif, who is representing the families of the dead workers in 
the wrongful-death action against the sanitation agency, said responsibility 
for monitoring the potentially dangerous oxygen levels rested with the Orange 
County sanitation agency. He has informed the sanitation agency of the 
families' intention to file a lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 Agency administrators have repeatedly declined to comment about the incident 
and the Cal/OSHA citations. 
</P>
<P>
 In his initial inquiry, Hafif said his investigators received contradictory 
information from sanitation administrators about some details about the 
incident. Hafif said he is pursuing leads that the agency might have withheld 
information about the incident and its possible causes from OSHA investigators. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wouldn't surprise me (if information were withheld)," Supervisor Steiner 
said. "There has been a pattern of withholding information from the board of 
directors on a whole series of issues." 
</P>
<P>
 Cal/OSHA investigators were not available for comment Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Fountain Valley Councilman John Collins, another agency director, said that 
while he was concerned with the outcome of pending investigations, he was 
satisfied that agency administrators had provided board members with sufficient 
information. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a tragedy here," Collins said. "I don't think there is anybody whose 
heart doesn't go out to the families. But if there is a problem, we've been 
assured that it will be taken care of." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the pending investigations and inquiries provide some hope for the 
family members, none has been able to stray far from the events of Feb. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 "These two men died," Venezio said. "Somebody needs to come forward and tell 
how they died."

WESTMINSTER FIREFIGHTERS TO GET ELECTION HELP; POLITICS: LOCAL UNION EXPECTS 
ABOUT 300 COUNTERPARTS FROM ACROSS THE STATE TO CAMPAIGN HERE FOR RECALL OF 
FOUR COUNCIL MEMBERS. THE MAYOR DENOUNCES THE PLAN AND CALLS THE VOLUNTEERS 
'CARPETBAGGERS.' 
</P>

<P>
 In what Mayor Charles V. Smith called a blatant attempt by outsiders to 
influence a local election, as many as 300 firefighters from around the state 
are expected to answer a union call to walk precincts here today in an effort 
aimed at persuading voters to oust Smith and three other council members in an 
upcoming recall. 
</P>
<P>
 The action, which came after a plea for help from the firefighters local to 
its state parent, is the latest twist in a long-running battle between 
Westminster city officials and firefighters over reductions in the Fire 
Department's budget. And it appeared to herald an increasingly bitter battle 
leading up to the June 7 recall election, which targets City Council members 
Charmayne S. Bohman, Tony Lam and Craig Schweisinger, along with Smith. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are carpetbaggers coming from the outside to help the local union take 
control of our city," Schweisinger said Friday. "What does a fireman from San 
Jose have to do with a fireman in Westminster? Why are they here? The answer 
is: Because they're all part of the AFL-CIO conspiracy to take over our city. 
They have no business being here." 
</P>
<P>
 Union officials said Friday they were uncertain exactly how many firefighters 
from outside the community were arriving here to take part in today's 
door-to-door campaigning, but a political consultant working for the recall 
effort said the figure could approach 300. 
</P>
<P>
 "The city is trying to make them out as outsiders and invaders," consultant 
Phil Giarrizzo said, adding that the group will include non-union members as 
well. "These are firefighters from communities surrounding Westminster who put 
their lives on the line every day. We're proud to have their support." 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Garrison, a union director who was recently dismissed as a Westminster 
fire captain, said the issues in the election are of interest to firefighters 
everywhere, not just those in Westminster. 
</P>
<P>
 The mayor and the other targeted council members, Garrison said, "are trying 
to make this like Big Brother is coming down here and telling us what to do. We 
asked for support and help, and I'll be proud if firefighters from elsewhere 
come in to help us. 
</P>
<P>
 "This council is playing politics with lives." 
</P>
<P>
 Smith retorted: "This is a blatant attempt by the statewide fire union to take 
over the city of Westminster. Why are they interested in a little city like 
Westminster? They intend to make this a test case on how to take over a city." 
</P>
<P>
 He and the other targeted council members said they plan to hold their own 
block-walking campaign and rally today to try to boost their chances of 
surviving the June 7 vote. The rally begins at 9 a.m. at the campaign 
headquarters at 6721 Westminster Blvd., Suite 119. 
</P>
<P>
 The firefighters will gather at 10 a.m. at their local, 5086 Westminster 
Blvd., officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The recall effort began last fall, soon after the council voted to eliminate 
the positions of five firefighters and took one firetruck out of service. The 
firefighters contend that the staff reductions have endangered public safety. 
City officials say the cuts, part of a reorganization in the Fire Department, 
have had no visible effect on fire protection and in fact, have enhanced 
paramedic and ambulance services. 
</P>
<P>
 The conflict escalated in January, when the city, on the heels of an 
independent study of Fire Department payroll practices, accused some 
firefighters of fraudulently collecting overtime payments. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, city officials dismissed five Fire Department employees, including 
battalion chiefs Don Herr and Hal Raphael, captains Joe Wilson and Garrison, 
and firefighter Dana Bowler, all for alleged payroll abuses. In February, union 
President Paul Gilbrook also was fired over allegations that he improperly 
claimed sick leave and drove a fire engine with a suspended driver's license. 
</P>
<P>
 The former employees have denied wrongdoing and are seeking arbitration to 
regain their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 The union also has filed a federal civil rights suit against the city and 
several of its leaders, charging that the city's actions against the 
firefighters amounted to political retribution. They contended that the 
retribution was in response to political campaigning against the mayor and two 
other council members by top union officials in the last election.  
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the Orange County Central Labor Council of the AFL-CIO, the labor 
union's county representative, accused the Westminster City Council of union 
busting in dismissing the Fire Department employees.  
</P>
<P>
 "This action is an attempt by anti-worker forces in the city of Westminster to 
push forth their agenda of union-free work environments," the labor council 
said in a statement.

A CHANGE OF HEART ON INITIATIVE BARRING ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS; POLITICS: 69TH 
ASSEMBLY DISTRICT CANDIDATE TED R. MORENO SAYS HE MISSPOKE WHEN HE LENT SUPPORT 
DURING DEBATE.

 Santa Ana Councilman Ted R. Moreno created some political turbulence Friday in 
the Democratic race for the 69th Assembly District when he said he would vote 
for a proposed initiative to bar illegal immigrants from public hospitals and 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreno, who made the comment during the taping of a KOCE-TV candidates debate, 
reversed his position several hours later, explaining he "misspoke" and that he 
had not had a "full understanding" of the initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 By time Moreno reversed his position, his opponents had already tried to take 
advantage of Moreno's remarks.  
</P>
<P>
 Moreno's political rivals said they were surprised to hear Moreno say he would 
vote for the initiative if it qualifies for the November ballot, because 
Moreno's campaign is expected to receive up to $20,000 from Latino Assembly 
members who vehemently oppose the measure. 
</P>
<P>
 After learning about Moreno's comments, Assemblywoman Diane Martinez 
(D-Alhambra) said she was puzzled, particularly because she believes the 
initiative is "racist on its face." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to give (Moreno) an opportunity to explain. I will give him the 
benefit of the doubt and (make him) give me accountability for his answers 
(during the debate)," Martinez said. 
</P>
<P>
 If passed, the "Save Our State" initiative would require schools to verify the 
immigration status of pupils and report to law enforcement agencies the names 
of parents they believe are in the country illegally. Illegal immigrants could 
receive emergency care under the proposed initiative, but hospital officials 
would also be required to report "persons who are apparent illegal aliens." 
</P>
<P>
 The initiative is immensely popular in Orange County and was favored by 62% of 
statewide voters in a Times Poll in March. 
</P>
<P>
 During the sometimes testy, hourlong debate that included the four Democrats, 
four Republicans and a Libertarian, the candidates were asked how they would 
vote on the initiative in November. 
</P>
<P>
 "You want to know what I've done? I've already signed that initiative because 
you have to give voters a chance to vote on it," Moreno said. When the 
moderator pressed for a specific answer, Moreno replied: "I will vote yes on 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 Several hours after the debate ended, Moreno issued a statement explaining his 
reversal. 
</P>
<P>
 In the news release, Moreno said he supports parts of the initiative, 
including denying welfare benefits to illegal immigrants and increased 
penalties for the manufacture, distribution and use of false documents. But he 
opposes any proposal that denies education or health care benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 "After having an opportunity to review the initiative thoroughly, I find that 
I cannot in good conscience support such a mean-spirited, wrongheaded proposal 
that does nothing to resolve the real problems associated with illegal 
immigration," Moreno said in the statement. 
</P>
<P>
 During the debate, two other Democrats seeking the central Orange County 
Assembly seat also said they would vote for the measure. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana Chamber of Commerce President Michael Metzler said: "This is a 
nation of laws. . . . This goes to the heart of what the law is and I support 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana businessman John M. Patterson said, "If you're illegal aliens, 
you're illegal." 
</P>
<P>
 The only candidate opposed to the measure is political activist Zeke 
Hernandez. 
</P>
<P>
 As soon as the taping ended, Hernandez and Arturo Montez, president of the 
Orange County chapter of the League of United Latin American Citizens, targeted 
Moreno for criticism, claiming he was trying to court the conservative vote 
while seeking the support of influential Latino leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has to get some votes outside the Latino community, as do I, but there's a 
way to take a stand on an issue without ignoring or turning your back on your 
community," Hernandez said before learning of Moreno's policy reversal. 
</P>
<P>
 Montez, meanwhile, notified state Assemblyman Richard Polanco (D-Los Angeles), 
the chairman of the Legislature's Latino Caucus, of Moreno's comments. 
</P>
<P>
 Latinos make up about two-thirds of the population in the district, which 
includes Anaheim, Garden Grove and Santa Ana. But because voter registration 
among Latinos is traditionally low, whites account for more than 70% of the 
district's voters, according to a 1993 Times Orange County computer analysis. 
</P>
<P>
 The seat is currently held by Assemblyman Tom Umberg (D-Garden Grove), who is 
stepping aside to run for state attorney general and has endorsed Metzler. 
</P>
<P>
 Metzler's campaign manager, Cate Whiting, surmised Moreno's campaign could 
suffer as a result of his comment because he has courted the support of the 
Assembly's Latino members. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he will have some explaining to do," Whiting said. 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblyman Joe Baca, (D-San Bernardino), who has endorsed Hernandez, said he 
also would be discussing the issue with Polanco, the Latino caucus chairman. 
</P>
<P>
 "I cannot speak for everyone (in the Latino caucus)," Baca said, "but Polanco 
is my seat mate (in the Assembly) and he definitely would be against the 
initiative because we have consistently fought the battles against 
discrimination of Latinos." 
</P>
<P>
 The television debate airs on KOCE-TV on June 4 and June 6.

AS DEBI FRENCH AND HER FAMILY HAVE FOUND OUT, TB IS NO DISEASE OF THE PAST; 
FIGHTING A FORMIDABLE FOE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE BERKMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Patti French remembers that when she learned that her 17-year-old daughter, 
Debi, had tuberculosis last May, she was relieved that the severe weight loss, 
lung congestion and paleness were not symptoms of something worse. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought, 'Thank God, we can deal with this and get her well,' " French 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 But over the past year, the French family has discovered to its dismay that 
tuberculosis -- on the verge of extinction in the United States just a decade 
ago -- can be a formidable foe. 
</P>
<P>
 Debi, now 18, who has suffered a relapse, on Tuesday will have a third of her 
right lung removed at National Jewish Center for Immunology and Respiratory 
Medicine in Denver, a major international center for treating people with 
drug-resistant TB. The operation, being performed to remove the TB bacteria 
from her body, is expected to greatly increase her chances for a full recovery, 
doctors say. 
</P>
<P>
 Debi is one of 17 La Quinta High School students to have contracted the 
disease since 1991. Health officials have determined that 12 of the students, 
Debi among them, acquired a drug-resistant strain of TB. County officials say 
the other 11 responded well to modern medications that are the first line of 
therapy for drug-resistant strains. 
</P>
<P>
 At first Debi, too, seemed to respond well to drug therapy. Her mother said a 
family physician suspected that Debi had TB after her bronchitis-like symptoms 
persisted despite medical treatment. A chest X-ray confirmed his suspicions. 
</P>
<P>
 Patti and her husband, Fred, said they also notified officials at La Quinta 
and kept Debi out of school for six weeks while she took antibiotics. "She felt 
better immediately," Patti French recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 Debi was able to go to summer camp and to join the rest of the La Quinta 
senior class in the fall, her parents said. Her doctor thought her progress so 
satisfactory that he was prepared to recommend that she discontinue treatment, 
they said. In February, however, Debi tested positive for TB bacteria in a 
sputum screening. Debi took further medications, but the bacteria in her lungs 
quickly multiplied. 
</P>
<P>
 At the recommendation of county health officials, the Frenches said, Debi was 
admitted to UCI Medical Center in Orange for intense intravenous drug therapy; 
she then continued to receive the therapy at home with the help of visiting 
nurses. 
</P>
<P>
 At the end of March, a sputum culture showed that the TB strain Debi had had 
become immune to all first-line medications. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was very frightening," her mother recalled. "I knew all along that if TB 
progresses far enough, it can kill you." 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Jodi Meador, tuberculosis controller with the Orange County Health Care 
Agency, said it will never be known for sure why Debi's relapse involved a TB 
strain even more drug-resistant than the one she originally became infected 
with. Meador said this kind of relapse most commonly occurs when a patient does 
not take medications as prescribed. But Debi and her parents say she was very 
careful to take her pills. 
</P>
<P>
 Another possibility, Meador said, is that Debi was not prescribed medications 
in sufficient doses. Debi's doctor said that sometimes TB bacteria may 
inexplicably spontaneously mutate to a more drug-resistant form. 
</P>
<P>
 Debi's parents said county health officials then advised them to send Debi to 
the Denver hospital. For the trip, Debi had to travel by private jet because 
her condition was contagious. In fact, the first pilot contacted refused the 
job for fear of catching TB, they said. Patti French and her daughter boarded a 
plane to Denver April 5. 
</P>
<P>
 There, Patti French said, Debi was placed on a regimen of older TB drugs that 
have can have serious side effects but that seem to be working. The only side 
effect Debi has experienced, her mother said, is a brown tinge to her skin that 
looks like a tan. 
</P>
<P>
 Five weeks ago, Debi's sputum tests began to test negative, showing that the 
bacteria in her lungs were on the decline. By next week a culture will show 
whether she is clear of active disease. Nonetheless, the disease-damaged upper 
lobe of her right lung, where most of the TB bacteria are concentrated, will be 
removed to increase her chances of recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. James Cook, head of the infectious diseases division at the National 
Jewish Center, said: "We are hoping her surgery will get rid of disease on the 
right side (of her lungs) and antibiotics will take care of the rest." 
</P>
<P>
 After the operation, health officials said, Debi will not be contagious, but 
she will need to continue taking antibiotics for three years. During that time, 
she will be given regular sputum tests to make sure she does not suffer another 
relapse. 
</P>
<P>
 Debi, interviewed in Denver by telephone, says she is eager to put the illness 
behind her. "Anybody would be scared by having something cut out, but I am 
anticipating going home. I miss my school, my friends and family and all the 
activities," said the onetime high-school flag twirler. She says she hopes to 
return to school in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Her parents said Debi, who also had been active in the school choir and a 
member of a church band, has suffered psychologically in being away from her 
friends and school. 
</P>
<P>
 "For a high schooler, the isolation is overwhelming," Patti French said. Some 
of Debi's friends have been afraid of catching TB from her, and one fearful 
friend initially refused even to talk to Debi on the telephone, her mother 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuberculosis has been on the upswing for several years, health authorities 
say, because of several factors. These include an increase in immigration from 
Third World countries where the disease is endemic, lack of experience among 
the medical community in recognizing and treating it, and the difficulty in 
persuading infected individuals to take their medication consistently. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had tuberculosis in the 19th Century. It shouldn't be happening in the 
20th Century," said Debi's father, Fred French. "I think it is important that 
people realize that something we thought was history is not. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is happening right now and we need to educate ourselves to the fact that 
proper treatment is the only cure. We can't go at it halfheartedly. There needs 
to be an all-out effort with everybody -- the schools and medical people -- 
involved."

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; TATTOOING CLASSIFIED AS AN ADULT 
BUSINESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BILLITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Despite pleas of some tattoo artists, the City Council has enacted zoning 
regulations that classify tattoo parlors as an adult business. 
</P>
<P>
 By a 5-2 vote earlier this week, the council enacted the new restrictions, 
which greatly limit where a tattoo establishment may operate. 
</P>
<P>
 During a public hearing Monday , several tattoo artists urged the council not 
to classify tattooing as an adult business -- a zoning category that includes 
massage parlors. 
</P>
<P>
 Raul Munoz told the council that there is a "misconception" about tattoo 
establishments. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tattoo (establishments) are something which would not hurt the Huntington 
Beach community but would definitely enhance it," he said. "I would like to 
open up a shop in this area." 
</P>
<P>
 Only one business in the city operates openly as a place where people can get 
tattooed. That business, on Beach Boulevard near Indianapolis Avenue, drew a 
protest at the meeting from one resident. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not saying it (tattooing) is wrong," said Sarah Kersten, who lives near 
the business. "I'm saying it's the wrong location for the business. . . . For 
the neighborhood, it is wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 The owner of that business, Traci Goodson-Smith, told the council that 
tattooing is only one aspect of her store. Goodson-Smith said she has a valid 
business license and that since she obtained it before the city passed its 
zoning for tattoo establishments, she expects to be "grandfathered in." 
</P>
<P>
 But city zoning officials told the council they disagree with Goodson-Smith. 
They said tattooing was never permitted under existing licenses and that 
Goodson-Smith's business should not be allowed to include that service at its 
current location. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilmen Jim Silva and Earle Robitaille voted against the tattoo zoning 
restrictions. Silva said he wanted to increase the distance tattoo parlors must 
be from residential areas. The zoning regulation passed by the council requires 
a 200-foot separation; Silva asked for a minimum of 250 feet. 
</P>
<P>
 Robitaille, after the council meeting, said he voted against the zoning 
measure "because I don't consider tattooing an adult business." 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday night, at another meeting, the City Council considered a new 
ordinance that would require health and safety standards at tattoo parlors. 
That ordinance, which is expected to be given final passage next month, is a 
companion measure to the new zoning restrictions on tattoo establishments.BILL

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: DANA POINT; WATER DISTRICT NAMES GENERAL MANAGER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEN HALL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The board of directors of the Capistrano Beach County Water District this week 
hired consultant Bill Meadows as its full-time general manager at a salary of 
$6,500 a month plus benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 Meadows, who has been acting manager since May, 1993, will also get the use of 
a district car, a 1989 Dodge.His term was made retroactive to May 1 and will 
last until the district merges with the Capistrano Beach Sanitary District on 
Jan. 1, 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 The board vote Wednesday night was 4 to 1, with director Ken Lawrence 
dissenting. 
</P>
<P>
 Director Jim Hayton said he voted for Meadows because of his "excellent 
performance" during the past year. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's done an awesome job," Hayton said. "He is honest and forthright." 
</P>
<P>
 Lawrence also praised the work Meadows had done but thought the salary was too 
high. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel that $6,500 a month, plus another 20% to 25% in benefits, is a little 
more than the job is worth," Lawrence said. "You're approaching $100,000 a 
year, and I don't think this small water district should take that much 
effort." 
</P>
<P>
 The district serves about 8,000 customers in Capistrano Beach, Dana Point, 
Dana Point Harbor and a small portion of north San Clemente.LEN HALL

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; CAUGHT UP IN A DAY OF HAPPINESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 On the shore of a sun-drenched lake in Anaheim, Elvia Gonzalez tugged hard on 
a fishing rod and excitedly reeled in her second fish of the day. 
</P>
<P>
 After showing off her prize to her friends, Elvia grinned and said fishing is 
always more fun when you catch something. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was fun because I felt kind of special," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Elvia, 15, was one of more than 500 physically disabled children from 
throughout the county who went fishing on Friday as part of an annual program 
sponsored by Easter Seal Society of Los Angeles & Orange Counties Inc. Sponsors 
said the event is designed to give children with disabilities a chance to "have 
fun and gain a sense of accomplishment." 
</P>
<P>
 Flanked by almost 300 volunteers, including many retired residents and fishing 
enthusiasts, the children gleefully cast their lines into the Santa Ana Rivers 
Lake and pulled out flopping trout by the dozens. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Towney, 33, said he has volunteered for the past seven years and that 
events like this are important to make the community aware that, "handicapped 
people are people too." 
</P>
<P>
 The best part of participating is seeing the faces of the children, said 
Towney, who lives in Orange. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw one kid who caught two or three fish. When he caught one, he'd jump up 
and down and scream and high-five anyone he'd come across," Towney said. 
</P>
<P>
 Towney said his reward for helping out is, "their laughter and smiles. You 
can't ask for anything more than that. Their enthusiasm makes it all 
worthwhile."JON NALICK

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: NEWPORT BEACH; CITY HALL SHOWCASES STUDENT-DRAWN ART 
</P>

<P>
 While strolling through City Hall, it is difficult not to stare at the 
two-headed goat with no pants. And the blue-haired, tough guy with a mermaid 
tail is also a head turner. 
</P>
<P>
 These surreal pastel-on-paper portraits were done by seventh- and eighth-grade 
students at Ensign Intermediate School and students at Corona del Mar High 
School. The portraits will hang on the walls of the Newport Beach City Hall 
until June 7. 
</P>
<P>
 Nick Harvey, an eighth-grader at Ensign who was at the art opening Thursday 
night at City Hall, said his two-headed worm drawing has something to say, even 
to the mayor. One of the worm's heads is in sunlight, the other in darkness. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is just that there is a happy look on one side and a sad look on another," 
Harvey said. 
</P>
<P>
 Each drawing was done by three artists. With the paper folded into three 
sections, one person drew a head, the next person drew a torso without looking 
at the head, and the final person contributed legs. At that point, the paper is 
unfolded, revealing a sometimes senseless, sometimes brilliant composite 
drawing.  
</P>
<P>
 The school art project was initiated by Jane Bauman, the artist in residence 
at the Newport Harbor Art Museum, and funded with $5,000 from the city.  
</P>
<P>
 Said Joan Stipe, an art teacher at Ensign: "It's nice to be supported." BOB

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAKE FOREST; PROPOSAL WILL TRIM PARKING SPACE WIDTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MESSINA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hoping to draw more shoppers into the city, the City Council agreed this week 
to shrink parking spaces in commercial and retail centers. 
</P>
<P>
 The ordinance reduces the minimum size for a standard parking space by six 
inches, a move applauded by commercial property owners in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "My feeling is that it would enhance shopping in Lake Forest," said Ray 
Gelgur, owner of the Civic Center Plaza, a retail/commercial plaza where City 
Hall is located. "It would make more space available, which is particularly 
good when you have a crowded center." 
</P>
<P>
 The width of a standard size lot could be reduced from nine feet to 8 1/2 feet 
under the proposed law. Only 30% of a shopping center's parking spaces could be 
reduced to 8 1/2 feet. 
</P>
<P>
 However, compact car spaces would not be affected by the proposed ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
 "My concern is that the space would be sufficient for vans and large vehicles, 
that there would be enough room to open doors without dinging other cars all 
the time," said Councilwoman Ann Van Haun. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's certainly to the city's advantage for there to be as many parking spaces 
as possible," Van Haun said before the Tuesday meeting. "Many citizens (who) 
grumble about not finding enough room to park . . . might shop some place other 
than Lake Forest." 
</P>
<P>
 Approval of the new law would mean about 20 extra vehicles could park in the 
368-space Civic Center Plaza.  
</P>
<P>
 Gelgur asked the council to allow that 50% of all standard spaces be reduced 
in size. However, council members followed the advice of the city Planning 
Commission, which said the city should start with 30%. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Planning Commission felt it would be more prudent to recommend a small 
step rather than the full 50%," said Kathy Graham, city community development 
director.  
</P>
<P>
 In South County, only San Clemente and Laguna Beach allow standard space 
widths of less than nine feet, the county standard. About half of the 115 
California cities surveyed by Lake Forest city staff allow smaller standard 
spaces. FRANK MESSINA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: BUENA PARK; BOYS & GIRLS CLUB TO HOLD FUND-RAISER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Boys & Girls Club of Buena Park, which serves more than 1,200 youths, will 
hold its biggest fund-raiser of the year Sunday.  
</P>
<P>
 Club executive director Jean Morgan said the organization has been hit by 
recessionary times, forcing the nonprofit group to work harder at obtaining 
donations to pay for programs and operations.The club's operating budget is 
about $500,000 this year; about 25% comes from fund-raisers and special events, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Morgan said the club is counting on the fourth annual auction, wine and 
food-tasting event to raise about $32,000. The event raised $5,000 in its first 
year, and last year's proceeds were about $21,000, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The fund-raiser will be held from 1 to 4 p.m. at U.S. Amada Ltd., 7025 
Firestone Blvd., Buena Park. The cost is $25 per person and includes food, wine 
and the opportunity to bid on auction items. Tickets are available at the door. 
</P>
<P>
 Morgan also said a drawing will be held for three prizes: a $1,000 shopping 
spree at Nordstrom; an executive suite for 10 people at Anaheim Stadium for a 
ballgame, and a $1,000 U.S. savings bond. Tickets for the drawing are $25. 
</P>
<P>
 If all 400 drawing tickets are sold, Morgan said $10,000 would be raised for 
the club. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor William G. Steiner is also expected to present the club with a 
$50,000 check from the county to pay for needed building renovations.

<P>
 The Planning Commission has denied a permit to a group of Australian investors 
who had hoped to open a youth hostel in Newport Beach in time for the World Cup 
soccer tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Commissioners voted 5 to 2 Thursday against the proposal, the majority saying 
that the 50-bed hostel needs more than the three parking spaces currently 
available near 430 32nd St. Some nearby residents and businesses also have 
complained that a $15-per-night hostel would attract vagrants and 
troublemakers.BOB ELSTON

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA ANA; WOMAN GETS JAIL FOR BRIBES, INTIMIDATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A Garden Grove mother and Sunday school teacher was sentenced Friday to one 
year in jail for bribing and intimidating witnesses against her sons, who were 
facing charges in separate gang-related robbery and sexual assault cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Maria Trinidad Rodarte, 43, pleaded guilty in March to two felony counts of 
bribery.In once case, Maria Rodarte offered a woman $500 in June to retract her 
identification of Lino Rodarte, 21, as one of several reputed gang members who 
robbed a pizza delivery driver, said Deputy Dist. Atty. John Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
 In a second, unrelated incident, Maria Rodarte intimidated a witness between 
December, 1990, and January, 1991, into changing her testimony against Raul 
Rodarte, 24, who was accused of robbery and sexual assault, Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Superior Court Judge William R. Froeberg, who also sentenced 
Rodarte to three years' probation, had harsh words for her, Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The judge told her that all of society was a victim in this case," Anderson 
said. "The judge thought it was an egregious crime." 
</P>
<P>
 Rodarte's attorney did not return a phone call seeking comment. The judge 
allowed Rodarte to postpone until July 8 reporting to jail. 
</P>
<P>
 A sentencing report prepared by the Orange County Probation Department said a 
mitigating factor in Rodarte's favor was evidence that she only wanted to 
protect her sons. 
</P>
<P>
 But Anderson disagreed. He also said evidence that Rodarte taught Sunday 
school at her local church and was involved in anti-drug and anti-gang efforts 
worked against -- not for -- her. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anyone and everyone knows that what she did was wrong," Anderson said. "If 
she was involved in those activities, then she is more aware than the average 
person about why this is so wrong. You don't help your sons by perverting the 
same system designed to protect their rights." RENE LYNCH

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: WESTMINSTER; SCHOOL'S LIBRARY BOOKS TO BE SOLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JON NALICK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Westminster School District trustees have approved a plan to sell the library 
collection from Virginia K. Boos Elementary School for at least $27,000 and buy 
new books for other schools with the proceeds. 
</P>
<P>
 Boos Elementary is scheduled to be closed in June. 
</P>
<P>
 The Board of Trustees voted 4 to 1 in favor of the plan, with trustees Ron 
Morgan, Sheryl Neugebauer, Nancy L. Blumenthal and Kathy Stirling Iverson in 
support. Trustee Margie L. Rice opposed the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Supt. Gail Wickstrom recommended the books be sold, pointing out that many of 
them have remained unused for years. She also said that some of the older books 
may be considered sexist by contemporary standards. 
</P>
<P>
 Selling the books is expected to bring in at least $27,000. Keeping the books 
and distributing them among the district's other schools, as some parents 
suggested, could cost as much as $10,000 in clerical work to catalogue the 
books, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 District spokeswoman Audrey Brown said the collection will be sold to the 
highest bidder. Potential buyers may now make appointments to review the 
collection from June 20 to June 30 by calling (714) 894-7311, Ext. 205. Bids 
will be accepted through July 12. JON NALICK

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FOUNTAIN VALLEY; CITY TO NEGOTIATE DEAL FOR 2 WATER WELLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBRA CANO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council agreed this week to negotiate a lease with Newport Beach for 
the building of two water wells in Fountain Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Newport Beach proposes to build a pump station for the two wells near Slater 
Avenue west of the San Diego Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Staneart,Newport Beach utilities department director, said Newport Beach 
would agree to a long-term lease, even though it would like to buy the land. 
</P>
<P>
 Staneart said Newport Beach has offered to pay $25,000 a year to lease the 
property. 
</P>
<P>
 He said Newport Beach proposes to build a one-story, 3,600-square-foot 
building for the pumping station. 
</P>
<P>
 Fountain Valley Mayor John Collins said he is concerned that the city might 
have to buy water from outside sources once Newport Beach begins pumping water 
from the wells. 
</P>
<P>
 Fountain Valley currently gets 75% of its water from the underground basin. 
</P>
<P>
 "My concern is a money concern," Collins said. He said the money the city 
would receive from the lease would not be enough in the event the city has to 
buy additional water. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, Newport Beach is planning to drill four wells in Fountain Valley at 
two separate sites. 
</P>
<P>
 Two other wells will be built at Hisamatsu Tamura Elementary School. Those two 
wells have already been approved by the school district. 
</P>
<P>
 Staneart said the wells should be completed by mid- to late-1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Staneart said Newport Beach is in need of the water wells to lessen the city's 
dependence on buying from the Metropolitan Water District. 
</P>
<P>
 The $17-million well project is expected to produce enough water to serve 
28,000 households, he said. DEBRA CANO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA ANA; MANISCALCO JUDGE DELAYS SENTENCING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RENE LYNCH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The case of People vs. Thomas F. Maniscalco, Orange County's longest-running 
criminal case, will go on a little longer. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, Orange County Superior Court Judge Kathleen E. O'Leary reluctantly 
postponed sentencing for the convicted triple murderer but accused the defense 
of seeking out the kind of preferential handling that is rarely granted in 
murder cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Maniscalco's defense team recently persuaded Superior Court Judge Myron S. 
Brown, who has no connection to the case, to hire a private consultant -- at 
public expense -- to prepare a report on Maniscalco in preparation for his 
sentencing. 
</P>
<P>
 The report would in many ways duplicate the work already done by the county 
Probation Department, whose job it is to prepare sentencing reports for all 
convicted murderers, the judge and prosecutor agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very concerned Mr. Maniscalco is receiving what appears to be special 
treatment," O'Leary said. 
</P>
<P>
 Maniscalco, a Westminster attorney who co-founded the Hessians motorcycle 
gang, was convicted of three counts of second-degree murder in the slayings of 
Richard (Rabbit) Rizzone, 36; Rizzone's bodyguard, Thomas Monahan, 28, and 
Rizzone's girlfriend, Rena Miley, 19. Miley was also raped. 
</P>
<P>
 The three were murdered in a Westminster ranch home on Memorial Day, 1980. But 
Maniscalco was not arrested until March 15, 1984. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors said Maniscalco plotted the killings in a dispute over counterfeit 
money and drug profits skimmed from his gang. The defense said Maniscalco has 
been framed for the murders. 
</P>
<P>
 His conviction came 10 years to the day after his arrest, following a 
torturous trip through the legal system marked by two trials and hundreds of 
legal motions and delays. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, Deputy Dist. Atty. Rick King argued against any further delays and 
urged the judge to go forward with the sentencing. He noted that Gary Miley, a 
retired Los Alamitos police officer whose daughter was killed, had attended the 
sentencing hearing to make a statement. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's time to put finality to this case," King said. 
</P>
<P>
 But O'Leary questioned whether she could overrule a fellow judge with equal 
jurisdiction and decided to postpone the hearing until June 24 out of concern 
that the issue could be raised on appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Leary said Friday she could not understand the arrangement behind the 
private sentencing report. 
</P>
<P>
 "The logic of that escapes me," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But defense attorney Curt Livesay said he was only doing his job to ensure 
that his client receives proper representation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would have done it with any client," Livesay said. 
</P>
<P>
 Livesay said the report was "critical" because it could help determine where 
Maniscalco would be placed in the state prison system and when -- if ever -- he 
might be eligible for parole. The judge replied that the same is true of all 
murder defendants facing sentencing, and probation department reports suffice 
for the vast majority of those cases. 
</P>
<P>
 "The propriety of what occurred is not something I'm going to waste a lot more 
time on," O'Leary said. RENE LYNCH

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FOUNTAIN VALLEY; SCHOOL DISTRICT CHIEF SAYS HE WILL RETIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After 10 years as the top administrator for the Fountain Valley School 
District, Supt. Ruben L. Ingram has announced his retirement. 
</P>
<P>
 Ingram's contract expires next year, but he has asked the Board of Trustees to 
give him an early retirement. 
</P>
<P>
 Ingram, 60, joined the district in 1980 as an assistant superintendent of 
instruction and four years later moved up to head the district. But now, after 
a 39-year career in education, Ingram said it's time to pursue other 
professional interests. 
</P>
<P>
 "Thirty-nine years is a pretty lengthy career, and since things are in good 
shape and I'm in good shape, it seemed like a good time to do it," said Ingram, 
who plans on doing consulting work. 
</P>
<P>
 Ingram's retirement will be effective Aug. 15. Deputy Supt. Robert G. Sampica 
has been appointed interim superintendent. 
</P>
<P>
 Board of Trustees President Robert Sedlak hailed Ingram as a "stabilizing 
influence" for the district. Sedlak said during Ingram's tenure he has improved 
labor negotiations and relations and managed to keep the budget balanced, 
despite declining enrollment. 
</P>
<P>
 Ingram started his career in 1955 with Long Beach Unified School District. He 
has taught at the elementary, high school and university levels and also served 
as principal at three elementary schools. 
</P>
<P>
 During the last decade with Fountain Valley School District, Ingram said, he 
is most proud to have been instrumental in improving students' achievements on 
state testing, building trust and mutual respect among employees, opening 
child-care programs at the eight elementary schools and equipping classrooms 
with computers. DEBRA CANO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ORANGE; COUNCIL WEIGHS TRIAL TELECASTS OF MEETINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The city may begin televising council meetings on a trial basis by mid-July, 
officials said this week. 
</P>
<P>
 For six weeks, probably beginning July 12, council meetings would be telecast 
live and on tape delay.Cablevision of Orange has agreed to pay $6,000 to fund 
the trial program. 
</P>
<P>
 The council is scheduled to vote on the proposal Tuesday. At their last 
meeting, council members directed city staff to establish a firm schedule for 
the trial cable program. 
</P>
<P>
 Initially, the trial period was going to be three weeks, but several council 
members said that would not give residents enough time to learn about the value 
of the telecasts. Local cable company officials later said they would fund the 
telecasts for three additional council meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's important for the public to get a representative sample of what 
goes on at council meetings," said Councilman Mark Murphy, who led the drive to 
bring TV cameras to council chambers. "Three meetings wouldn't be enough." 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Gene Beyer and Councilman Fred L. Barrera oppose televising council 
meetings. The mayor said a viewer survey should be completed before initiating 
television coverage in order to verify that there is sufficient community 
interest. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a luxury the city can't afford right now," Barrera said. 
</P>
<P>
 Depending on what technology the city chooses, start-up costs for cable 
coverage would reach $163,400 for robotic cameras and a City Hall control room, 
or they could be as low as $19,200 for a single camera operator, according to 
city estimates. Thereafter, recurring annual costs could reach $38,400 if the 
city opts for a control room, or stay at $19,200 if it chooses to go with the 
lone camera operator, estimates show. 
</P>
<P>
 The city is one of only nine in the county that does not telecast its council 
meetings.MARTIN MILLER

FAST-FOOD CUSTOMER SHOT IN 1 OF 2 HEISTS

<P>
 Two fast-food restaurants, both on Beach Boulevard, were hit by robbers in 
unrelated incidents, and one customer in a drive-through lane was shot as he 
struggled with the robber, police said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The victim, Steven Vuong, 30, of Westminster, was in good condition Friday, 
but his attacker remains at large.He was approached by the robber at 9:50 p.m. 
Thursday at a Jack-in-the-Box, Lt. Jeff Cope said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The suspect came up from behind the drive-through order board, placed a 
handgun against the victim's chest and demanded money," Cope said. "As the 
victim pulled his wallet from his pocket, he reached up with his other hand and 
pushed the gun away from his chest." 
</P>
<P>
 During the struggle, the gunman grabbed Vuong by the throat then shot him in 
the right thigh. He then reached into the car and grabbed Vuong's wallet, which 
was said to contain $2,000, from the front seat. 
</P>
<P>
 The gunman was last seen running south on Beach Boulevard, Cope said. 
</P>
<P>
 In another robbery of a fast-food restaurant Thursday, a gunman at a 
McDonald's restaurant escaped with $284 just after 3 p.m. and led officers on a 
freeway chase, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Huntington and Newport Beach police caught and arrested Richard B. Johnson, 
41, of Costa Mesa, who is accused of taking the money from the restaurant.

TRIAL DATE IS SET IN FIRST COUNTY '3 STRIKES' CASE; COURTS: MAN FACING FELONY 
ASSAULT CHARGES COULD RECEIVE 25 YEARS TO LIFE IN PRISON UNDER LAW. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The first Orange County man charged under the tough-on-crime "three strikes" 
law was ordered to stand trial Friday after the defense unsuccessfully argued 
that his first two felony convictions shouldn't count as "strikes" against him. 
</P>
<P>
 Municipal Judge Donald Macintyre in Westminster set a May 31 trial date for 
Mario Veliz Rodriguez, 30, who faces felony assault and weapons charges for 
allegedly shooting a man in the face with a flare gun during a barroom brawl. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodriguez faces a possible prison sentence of 25 years to life because the new 
"three strikes and you're out" law mandates the term for third-time felons 
whose earlier convictions included serious or violent felonies.  
</P>
<P>
 The judge ordered the Garden Grove forklift repairman to stand trial at the 
close of a preliminary hearing in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 During the hearing, Macintyre rejected an argument by Rodriguez's attorney 
that the "three strikes" legislation, designed to keep career felons off the 
streets, only applies to convictions after March 7 of this year, when the law 
went into effect. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Deputy Public Defender Leonard Gumlia told Macintyre that the 
legislation specifically states that a felony has to be declared a "strike" at 
the time of conviction. He said the public defender's office intends to take 
its argument to a higher court. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll do it until the issue is resolved," Gumlia said. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Arnold D. Westra, who is prosecuting Rodriguez, called the 
legal challenge "really a stretch." He said the state Legislature clearly 
intended that felonies prosecuted before March of this year to count as 
"strikes." 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to comment on Mr. Rodriguez's case, but I say taxpayers have 
seen violent felons commit crimes and be back on the streets, and at some point 
we've got to stop this," Westra said after the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters hail the "three strikes" law as a way to crack down on repeat 
offenders. But critics argue that it is overly broad, restricts judges' 
discretion and unfairly allows juvenile convictions to count as "strikes."  
</P>
<P>
 Defendants -- particularly juveniles -- often accepted plea bargains before 
the law went into effect that they never would have gone for if they knew what 
the implications would be, Gumlia said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We assured our (juvenile) clients that prior records would be sealed and 
never be used against them. We told them that," Gumlia said. 
</P>
<P>
 The law also allows for dual convictions stemming from one arrest to count as 
two "strikes," another point of contention with defense attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodriguez's first two "strikes" were for assault with intent to commit murder 
and second-degree robbery. His first conviction occurred when he was a 
juvenile, but he was sentenced in adult court. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday, Rodriguez sat hunched in the courtroom, his wrists and ankles 
shackled, listening to a Garden Grove man recount the barroom fight that led to 
his March 20 arrest and his dubious distinction as the first Orange County 
felon to be slapped with a "three strikes" enhancement. 
</P>
<P>
 Donald Moore, 23, said Rodriguez was drunk and belligerent at Sugar's bar that 
night, dancing "foolishly" with his shirt off. Rodriguez had been kicked out of 
the bar twice for bad behavior before he came back in with a flare gun, Moore 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 After Rodriguez pushed Moore's friend, Moore testified that he stepped toward 
Rodriguez, who pointed the flare gun at his face. They struggled for the gun 
and it went off about eight to 10 inches from his head, Moore said. He pointed 
to a crescent-shaped scar on his right temple that he said was caused by the 
gun. 
</P>
<P>
 "I heard it go off. I felt impact and then I felt blood dripping down my 
face," Moore testified. "I still had no knowledge that it was just a flare gun. 
I thought it was a .22." 
</P>
<P>
 Gumlia pressed Moore and Garden Grove Police Officer Vince Purinton, who 
arrested Rodriguez, for details about Rodriguez's state of drunkenness. He 
argued unsuccessfully that a flare gun may not qualify as a firearm and said 
the night's events do not add up to felony assault with a weapon. 
</P>
<P>
 "He points the gun at Mr. Moore only after Moore took a step toward him. I 
think he's guilty of brandishing a weapon," Gumlia said.  
</P>
<P>
 Moore said outside of court that he thinks Rodriguez deserves a 25-year 
sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think if I hadn't reacted as I did, he would have shot me in the face," he 
said. "From what I've read in the papers about his prior convictions, yes, I 
think he deserves it."

WOMAN GETS 19-YEAR PRISON SENTENCE FOR KILLING EX-BOYFRIEND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Lake Forest woman was sentenced Friday to 19 years to life in prison for 
fatally shooting her former boyfriend during an argument. 
</P>
<P>
 Linda Nancy Phillips, 44, claimed she gunned down Ricardo Ornelas, 40, of 
Fountain Valley out of fear for her own safety following a dispute at her home 
on May 28, 1992.But prosecutors contended that Phillips murdered Ornelas 
following a lovers' quarrel. 
</P>
<P>
 Phillips, a former secretary, and Ornelas, a nuclear engineer, had shared a 
stormy, "roller-coaster" relationship, according to evidence presented at 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
 An Orange County jury found her guilty of second-degree murder. On Friday, 
Superior Court Judge Everett W. Dickey sentenced Phillips to 15 years to life 
in prison for second-degree murder charge, and added four more years for a 
weapons charge.

DOCTOR DOUBTS MENTAL ABILITY OF MAN WHO LEFT GUNDERSON MONEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNN FRANEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 98-year-old man whose family says was tricked into giving his Orange County 
attorney a large portion of his estate was probably unaware of many things 
around him when he signed his will, a geriatrician testified Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. John Boyer, who heads the Center on Aging at the University of Arizona 
College of Medicine, said he believes Merrill A. Miller had deteriorated 
greatly both physically and mentally by 1990, when he bequeathed $3.5 million 
in stock to attorney James D. Gunderson. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there would be little question that (Miller) was demented in the last 
two years," Boyer told Superior Court Judge Byron K. McMillan, who is hearing 
the case without a jury. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller's family has filed a civil suit alleging that Gunderson coerced the 
$3.5-million bequest from the bedridden Miller, whose estate was worth about 
$18 million. The terms of the bequest also made the estate liable for an 
additional $1.7 million in federal inheritance taxes, pushing the total to more 
than $5 million. 
</P>
<P>
 In a will prepared in 1990, Miller, a Leisure World resident who died in 
February, 1992, bequeathed one-fifth of his holdings in Abbott Laboratories to 
Gunderson. 
</P>
<P>
 Gunderson testified Thursday that Miller willed him the stock because they 
were close friends. He also said Miller had decided as early as 1984 to name 
Gunderson as a beneficiary. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Gunderson had served as Miller's attorney for nearly two decades when 
the will was drawn up, he maintains that he did not prepare Miller's final 
will, which bears the signature of Ellsworth DeWeese, Gunderson's former law 
partner, as the attorney preparing the will. 
</P>
<P>
 But John Westover, the attorney representing Miller's relatives, said DeWeese 
was only brought into the picture to hide improper influence that he says 
Gunderson exerted on the elderly Miller. 
</P>
<P>
 A longstanding California Supreme Court ruling says that anything more than a 
modest bequest to an attorney preparing a will raises questions of impropriety, 
and the justices ruled that a $20,000 bequest to the attorney in that landmark 
case was an excessive gift that had to be returned. 
</P>
<P>
 Boyer, the geriatrician whose father-in-law was a longtime friend of Miller's, 
said Friday that he had never examined Miller for dementia, a disease that 
undermines many elderly people's understanding of complex thoughts. He 
testified that he based his decision that Miller was "not functioning at a 
level he had performed at previously" on Miller's medical records and on court 
depositions taken from Miller's doctor, live-in nurse and close friends. 
</P>
<P>
 Boyer said an action by Miller in 1990 led him to question Miller's mental 
capabilities. Boyer said that in late 1989 he sent Miller a letter telling him 
that Boyer's mother-in-law had died. The next year, Miller sent his usual 
Christmas package of dates to Boyer's mother-in-law, Boyer testified. 
</P>
<P>
 Gunderson has been embroiled in controversy since November, 1992, when The 
Times disclosed that he had inherited or otherwise acquired substantial sums 
from the estates of several of his clients. After the stories appeared, the 
State Bar of California announced an investigation into Gunderson's activities. 
</P>
<P>
 He retired in January after State Bar prosecutors said they were ready to file 
conflict-of-interest charges that could have led to his being disbarred. 
Gunderson's lawyers said he surrendered his license because of failing health, 
not the conflict-of-interest investigation.

PRIVATE BURIAL SET FOR ONASSIS AT ARLINGTON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STANLEY MEISLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Americans mourned the loss of a First Lady and the loss of an era Friday as 
the family of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis prepared a small and private funeral 
far different from the grand and wrenching public ceremonies that she once 
helped fashion for a slain husband and President. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the ceremonies will differ greatly, Mrs. Onassis, who died of cancer 
Thursday night at the age of 64, will be buried Monday afternoon alongside 
President John F. Kennedy and two of their children in Arlington National 
Cemetery across the Potomac River from Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Before she is taken to the cemetery that guards both celebrated Americans and 
ordinary soldiers, a Mass will be said for her at 10 a.m. Monday at St. 
Ignatius Loyola Roman Catholic Church on Park Avenue, just a couple of blocks 
from the 5th Avenue apartment where she died. 
</P>
<P>
 Preparations for a burial at Arlington, where an eternal flame flickers by the 
grave of President Kennedy, surely will arouse memories of the 1963 funeral 
that mesmerized the nation. Mrs. Onassis set aside her shyness and penchant for 
privacy then and orchestrated some of the most memorable features of President 
Kennedy's funeral. It was the young widow who ordered the riderless horse that 
followed the cortege. 
</P>
<P>
 But privacy will rule the day as she is interred by the side of the President; 
a son, Patrick Kennedy, who died three days after his birth in 1963; and a 
daughter stillborn in 1956. 
</P>
<P>
 Her two surviving children, 36-year-old Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg and 
33-year-old John F. Kennedy Jr., were with her when she died of cancer of the 
lymph system. Also present was her close friend in recent years, Maurice 
Tempelsman. 
</P>
<P>
 As a light rain fell Friday morning, her son, standing in front of the 
apartment building at 1040 5th Ave., told reporters that his mother had died at 
10:15 p.m. Thursday "surrounded by her friends and her family and her books and 
the people and the things that she loved." 
</P>
<P>
 "And she did it in her own way and in her own terms," he went on, "and we all 
feel lucky for that and now she's in God's hands." 
</P>
<P>
 Mrs. Onassis, when informed that her death was near, had left New York 
Hospital-Cornell Medical Center and returned to her apartment Wednesday night 
to face death in familiar surroundings. 
</P>
<P>
 Her son thanked everyone "both in New York and beyond" for "an enormous 
outpouring of good wishes."  
</P>
<P>
 And he pleaded: "I hope now that . . . we can just have these next couple of 
days in relative peace." 
</P>
<P>
 It was difficult, however, for reporters, photographers and television camera 
crews to break a habit ingrained by decades of trying to satisfy a public 
demand for more and more coverage of this glamorous yet very private woman. 
</P>
<P>
 Like several other mourners in the hours after Mrs. Onassis' death, an 
unidentified woman stopped to hand a rose to the doorman. She then walked to 
the corner and fell sobbing into the arms of another woman. The two crying 
women were quickly mobbed by the nearby media. Cameras and microphones thrust 
near their cheeks. A cameraman angrily ordered a soundman to lower the boom 
microphone closer to their mouths. Every tear was caught on tape and film. 
</P>
<P>
 More than a hundred reporters, photographers and television crew members kept 
their vigil throughout the day, joined by at least as many mourners and the 
curious. Many watched the comings and goings of friends and families from 
Central Park across the avenue. A number left mementos at the door. 
</P>
<P>
 A security guard from the nearby Metropolitan Museum of Art left a pale rose 
tied to a white ribbon. A note said: "From Dan and Thomas at the Met. We'll 
miss our friend." 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) and his wife, Victoria, spent 25 minutes in 
the apartment during the morning. Tempelsman left a few minutes later. 
</P>
<P>
 Traffic snarls often on 5th Avenue on normal days and it was even more snarled 
than usual as drivers slowed down to catch a glimpse of the building and the 
media crush. Police tried hard to move the traffic along, sometimes waving cars 
through red lights. 
</P>
<P>
 As the eulogies cascaded across news wires, President Clinton caught the mood 
of all by describing Mrs. Onassis -- widow of both President Kennedy and Greek 
shipping magnate Aristotle Onassis -- as "a model of courage and dignity for 
all Americans and all the world." 
</P>
<P>
 "More than any other woman of her time," the President went on before leaving 
Washington for a two-day trip to California, "she captivated our nation and the 
world with her intelligence, her elegance and her grace. Even in the face of 
impossible tragedy, she carried the grief of her family and our entire nation 
with a calm power that somehow reassured all the rest of us." 
</P>
<P>
 The President, accompanied by his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, spoke to 
reporters in the First Lady's Garden, a section of the White House grounds 
that, as Mrs. Clinton put it, "is named for her" and "which she helped to 
realize." 
</P>
<P>
 Mrs. Clinton said that Mrs. Onassis had once told her: "If you bungle raising 
your children, I don't think whatever else you do matters very much." 
</P>
<P>
 The two women had first discussed the "challenges and opportunities" of being 
the First Lady in the summer of 1992, Mrs. Clinton said, and Mrs. Onassis had 
explained "how she had managed so well to carve out the space and privacy that 
children need to grow into what they have a right to become." 
</P>
<P>
 Mourning for Mrs. Onassis spread throughout the land. In Boston, for example, 
tourists and residents lined up at the John F. Kennedy Library to sign a 
special condolence book that had been placed under a 1962 portrait of the 
former First Lady. 
</P>
<P>
 The golden-framed picture portrayed a 32-year-old Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy, 
eyes fixed in level gaze, with a faint smile. Visitors to the repository of the 
Kennedy papers seemed eager somehow to connect with the woman in the white suit 
and to convey the feelings of sadness that, as they milled about, they shared 
with one another. 
</P>
<P>
 "She will be missed!" wrote Edward S. Drake of Brea, Calif., carefully 
emphasizing the exclamation point. Bill Allen of Plymouth, Mass., called her 
"America's perfect lady," and Gill Peterson of Libertyville, Ill., described 
her as "a model for men and women." Raymond Beauhemin of Montreal penned a 
simple: "Adieu, madame." 
</P>
<P>
 As one of the founders of the Kennedy Library, Mrs. Onassis paid frequent 
visits to the striking white building in Boston's Dorchester section. A library 
spokesman called her "a boundless source of ideas and inspiration in the 
development of this institution." 
</P>
<P>
 The spokesman said that the condolence book will be sent to Mrs. Onassis' 
family. 
</P>

PALESTINIANS KILL 2 ISRAELI SOLDIERS AT CHECKPOINT; MIDEAST: SLAYERS ESCAPE 
UNPURSUED INTO NEWLY AUTONOMOUS GAZA. INCIDENT TESTS PEACE PACT WITH PLO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK FINEMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 One of Israel's worst fears became reality Friday when Palestinian militants 
gunned down and killed two Israeli soldiers at an unfortified checkpoint just 
inside the Gaza Strip from this border station and then fled without pursuit 
into the newly autonomous territory. 
</P>
<P>
 The pre-dawn killings came just 48 hours after Israel ended 27 years of 
military occupation in Gaza. For both Israel's border troops and the 
Palestinian police force that inherited most of the strip this week, it was the 
first major test of key provisions of the peace agreement that liberated Gaza 
and the West Bank town of Jericho. 
</P>
<P>
 By all accounts, both sides failed the test. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the attack occurred close to a heavily fortified Israeli border 
station, no Israeli troops pursued the gunmen as they sped off into the newly 
liberated Palestinian territory. The self-rule accord signed earlier this month 
by Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and Palestine Liberation Organization 
Chairman Yasser Arafat after eight months of meticulous negotiations 
specifically permits such pursuit by Israeli forces in just such circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
 Israel Radio said the attackers drove up to the checkpoint in a car, appeared 
to stop for a security check and shot the two soldiers as they approached the 
vehicle. The car then sped south as another Israeli soldier fired after it. 
</P>
<P>
 The killings were followed closely by the wounding of two Israeli garbage 
collectors in a drive-by shooting near a Jewish settlement in Gaza. 
</P>
<P>
 Hours later, Rabin exercised his only other option: He sealed the Erez border 
crossing, barring all Palestinians in the Gaza Strip from entering Israel for 
the next nine days and canceling about 2,500 work permits held by Gaza 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
 For their part, Gaza's new Palestinian police commanders, who are required 
under the self-rule accord to investigate and apprehend those who stage such 
attacks, did nothing to bring the assailants to justice. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior PLO officials and Palestinian military officers whose responsibility it 
now is to control the Gaza Strip offered apologies for the slayings. 
</P>
<P>
 Maj. Gen. Nasser Yussef, the Palestinian commander in Gaza, vowed to take 
steps to prevent such killings in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 But most of the newly arrived police force spent much of the day greeting 
long-lost relatives and recovering from the arduous journeys that brought them 
to Gaza this week from throughout the Arab world. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a failure for us," acknowledged Hisham Abdel Razzak, a key PLO leader 
in Gaza who spent 19 years in Israeli prisons. "But the Israeli public must 
understand how the situation is. . . . We, the police, are not yet prepared for 
all of this. We have not yet organized." 
</P>
<P>
 Razzak blamed Western donors for failing to deliver the cash needed to 
assemble the 2,500-strong force and to bring in additional forces. 
</P>
<P>
 Nabil Shaath, head of the PLO delegation that negotiated the key details of 
the self-rule accord, was making a surprise 24-hour visit to Gaza during the 
attack, and he told reporters that it was not unexpected. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew that some incident would happen, and I am very sorry," he said, 
interrupting daylong organizational meetings to discuss the killings outside 
the Palestinians' new beachfront police headquarters in Gaza City. "But I am 
not alarmed. We must now try to prevent a recurrence of this sort of incident." 
</P>
<P>
 Shaath met with Israel's deputy army chief, Gen. Amnon Shahak, and announced 
afterward that Palestinian and Israeli security forces will begin joint patrols 
in the Gaza Strip today. Like Shaath, Yossi Sarid, Israel's environment 
minister and a key architect of the peace plan, tried to play down the 
significance of the killings of the two soldiers, both fathers of newborn 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are the first days of the agreement," Sarid told Israel Radio. "At this 
time, incidents like these are expected. We hope that when the Palestinian 
police strengthens, gets organized, pulls itself together, the number of 
attacks will decrease gradually." 
</P>
<P>
 But the sheer number of underground Palestinian armed groups that claimed 
responsibility for Friday's attacks in Gaza illustrated what the new 
Palestinian police, most of them loyal to Arafat's more moderate faction of the 
PLO, are up against in the well-armed, impoverished and increasingly lawless 
Gaza Strip. 
</P>
<P>
 From the minarets of mosques throughout Gaza City, all holding special Friday 
prayers before today's Eid al Adha religious holiday, the fundamentalist 
Islamic faction Hamas proclaimed that it had staged the attack. 
</P>
<P>
 A handwritten poster attributed to Hamas and left outside Gaza City's police 
headquarters also warned the new Palestinian force: "Don't help the Satans and 
aggressors in our land. . . . This will increase hatred among Palestinians and 
lead to a new uprising." 
</P>
<P>
 Another Palestinian fundamentalist group, the Islamic Jihad (Holy War), also 
took responsibility for the slayings in leaflets handed to journalists in Gaza 
and in a handwritten statement faxed to news agencies in Jerusalem. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet a third militant faction opposed to the Israeli-PLO autonomy accord, the 
Damascus-based leftist Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, claimed 
in a telephone call to Israel Army Radio that it had staged the drive-by 
shooting of the garbage collectors near Gaza's Gush Katif Jewish settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 Briefing the security committee of Rabin's Cabinet on the situation that 
Israel left behind in Gaza on Thursday afternoon, military Chief of Staff Lt. 
Gen. Ehud Barak cited the many armed groups that oppose the accord -- as well 
as a general increase in street crime and looting -- to bolster his assessment 
that the Gaza Strip is now teetering dangerously close to total anarchy. 
</P>
<P>
 There was ample evidence of that chaos throughout the strip Friday. As newly 
arrived Palestinian police hugged and kissed relatives en route to a weekend 
leave to celebrate today's Muslim holiday, traffic snarled, water mains burst 
and crime continued apace. 
</P>
<P>
 Gone were the traffic police who had taken up positions earlier in the week. 
And Palestinian officials confirmed that formal police patrols will not begin 
until early next week. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the government's attempts to dismiss the shootings as birth pangs in 
an experiment in Palestinian autonomy, the reaction from Rabin's opponents was 
swift and furious. 
</P>
<P>
 Benjamin Netanyahu, leader of the opposition Likud Party, said the attack 
proved that the policy of Rabin's ruling Labor Party to make peace with 
Israel's Arab enemies "has failed." And Rafael Eitan, leader of another 
conservative opposition party, said Arafat's new police force is incapable of 
controlling the fundamentalist Hamas. 
</P>
<P>
 "I suggest now sending in huge numbers of troops and killing all the Hamas 
people and fighting them before they massacre women and children in the (Jewish 
settlements) or even outside the strip," Eitan told Israel Radio. 
</P>
<P>
 Even members of Rabin's own party expressed deep concern. Ori Orr, who heads 
the security and foreign affairs committee in Israel's Parliament, said the 
entire peace process "will fail if this arrangement will not stand up to the 
security test." 
</P>
<P>
 "To stand up to the security test means (that) terror decreases. If terror 
increases, there will be no agreement. There will be no one to support the 
agreement, not just in the opposition but in the Labor Party." 
</P>
<P>
 Environment Minister Sarid conceded that if such attacks continue or worsen, 
it will jeopardize scheduled negotiations to expand Palestinian self-rule to 
include all of the West Bank in the coming years. 
</P>
<P>
 Referring specifically to Arafat, who backed down earlier in the week from a 
speech in which he called for an Islamic holy war to liberate the disputed city 
of Jerusalem, Sarid said that if such a holy war materializes, "that will be 
the end of the experiment." 
</P>
<P>
 "I assume he (Arafat) understands this. . . . If he proves his efforts are 
productive and honest, the experiment will continue. If he cannot, or will not, 
it will finish there, with our withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho."

DETAILS OF ROSE BOWL TICKET DEAL REVEALED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RALPH FRAMMOLINO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 UCLA football booster Angelo M. Mazzone III and his business partner may have 
netted as much as $400,000 from tour packages put together with 4,000 tickets 
to the 1994 Rose Bowl they obtained from the Westwood school, according to 
estimates released Friday by Chancellor Charles E. Young. 
</P>
<P>
 In a six-page letter dated May 18, Young wrote to his counterpart at the 
University of Wisconsin that "documentary evidence" exists proving that 
Mazzone's tickets were sold to Wisconsin tour operators as part of packages 
that were resold to Wisconsin fans. The packages, according to the letter, were 
for four-night "land tours" the booster put togetherwith Al Brooks Rose Bowl 
Tours Inc., a Downtown ticket and tour agent. 
</P>
<P>
 Mazzone and Brooks sold those packages to out-of-state tour operators at $510 
each, "prices which could not be described in any way as 'gouging,' " Young 
wrote. Those operators then added air fare and resold the complete travel 
packages to Wisconsin fans. 
</P>
<P>
 The letter, which Young released Friday to The Times, is the first accounting 
of how much money changed hands as a result of the private deal between 
Mazzone, a prominent UCLA athletic donor and former associate athletic 
director, and university officials. 
</P>
<P>
 At the urging of Athletic Director Peter Dalis, Young approved the deal to 
sell Mazzone 4,000 tickets at their $46 face value in exchange for an 
additional $100,000 donation to the athletic department. 
</P>
<P>
 The transaction angered football fans at both universities who were either 
turned down for extra tickets or forced to pay scalpers' prices to attend the 
Jan. 1 game. A Wisconsin law firm filed a class action lawsuit against UCLA and 
the University of California regents on behalf of disappointed fans. Wisconsin 
Atty. Gen. James Doyle, who has also sued three ticket brokers, has blamed UCLA 
for contributing to an overheated ticket market. 
</P>
<P>
 Young apologized for the transaction in a letter to alumni, but said he and 
other UCLA officials could not anticipate the high demand for tickets at the 
time and feared that they would be stuck with unsold tickets. As it turned out, 
demand for tickets for the game, marking the Wisconsin Badgers' first Rose Bowl 
appearance in 31 years, was the highest in many years. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Young could not be reached for comment Friday, he said in an 
interview this week that he personally reviewed Mazzone's records and found no 
evidence of "excess profiteering." 
</P>
<P>
 Mazzone has refused public comment on the controversy, and on Friday a 
receptionist at his pension management firm, Qualified Benefits Inc. of 
Woodland Hills, said he was unavailable. Ticket agency owner Jaron (Jay) Brooks 
declined comment. 
</P>
<P>
 In his letter to Wisconsin Chancellor David Ward, Young offered the accounting 
of Mazzone's costs and profit to rebut accusations that "UCLA's transaction 
with Mr. Mazzone contributed to a 'frenzied' secondary market and to an overall 
pricing circumstance that hurt the University of Wisconsin supporters." 
</P>
<P>
 Young's letter said Mazzone and Brooks have had a "joint venture" of providing 
Rose Bowl "land" packages to out-of-state operators for more than 10 years. 
Young said this year's four-night package was offered in November -- before 
Mazzone made his deal with Young and UCLA -- at the wholesale price of $510 per 
person. All of the packages were sold to Wisconsin tour operators in early 
December, who resold them to Wisconsin fans "on a timely basis," Young wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 Mazzone's package not only included a Rose Bowl ticket, but also a $28 
bleacher seat for the Rose Parade; a $4 pass to the Rose Parade "float 
facility"; an adult ticket to Universal Studios; bus transportation during the 
trip; an estimated $200 for four nights in a double-occupancy Los Angeles hotel 
room, and $10 for a box lunch on the day of the football game, Young wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Young said the cost of each tour package included a $25 "pro rata 
share" of the $100,000 donation to endow UCLA athletic scholarships. 
</P>
<P>
 Deducting those costs, plus a 10% commission for the tour operators, Young 
estimated that Mazzone and Brooks made $99 on each package, or almost $400,000. 
That figure does not include "indirect costs" for staff time, printing and 
promotion, he wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times reported this month that Mazzone bought another 733 Rose Bowl 
tickets at face value from other Pac-10 schools. Using Young's cost figures, 
Mazzone and Brooks could have cleared at least another $72,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Young noted in his letter that the $510 land package offered with the UCLA 
tickets sold for less than the $843-per-person land package offered by Conlin 
Dodds Inc., which was chosen to put together official tours for the Wisconsin 
Alumni Assn. Young acknowledged that there were some differences between the 
packages. 
</P>
<P>
 Tim Van Alstine, Wisconsin's ticket director, said Friday that rules for the 
Big Ten conference obligate the alumni association of the conference's Rose 
Bowl representative to put together official tour packages, and that Conlin 
Dodds was awarded the business after competitive bidding. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of the deal, Van Alstine said he sold Conlin Dodds 6,000 Rose Bowl 
tickets at face value for the tours. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles ticket brokers have said they would have paid UCLA considerably 
more than Mazzone had the school opened the tickets up to bidding.

SOLZHENITSYN HEADS HOME TO WRITE RUSSIA'S WRONGS; CULTURE: DISSIDENT AUTHOR 
FACES UNEASY HOMECOMING IN A LAND CAUGHT IN A PAINFUL POST-SOVIET REBIRTH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The newest estate on a bluff over the Moscow River is an imposing red brick 
dacha with two stories, two wings and a high green fence secluding its 10 
pine-shaded acres. From the outside, it looks worthy of the great man who plans 
to spend his final years here. 
</P>
<P>
 Alexander I. Solzhenitsyn, the dissident writer who exposed and outlasted his 
Soviet tormentors, is returning home next Friday after 20 years in exile to 
rediscover his beloved Russia and offer his wisdom to help guide its painful 
post-Communist rebirth. 
</P>
<P>
 But before he can weigh in on such issues as the gulf between Russia's rich 
and poor, the grip of organized crime, the spread of Western consumer culture 
and the specter of fascism, he faces an irritating little problem right under 
his new doorstep. 
</P>
<P>
 The basement leaks. 
</P>
<P>
 In his first lesson about the new Russia, Solzhenitsyn has fallen victim to 
the capitalist version of an old Soviet problem -- khaltura , or shoddy 
workmanship. As often happens here, the author did not have a contract and the 
architect refused to do it over for free. 
</P>
<P>
 The affront may be trifling compared to Solzhenitsyn's eight-year imprisonment 
in Josef Stalin's gulag and expulsion by Leonid I. Brezhnev's KGB, but it is 
just one sign that the 75-year-old sage is in for an uneasy homecoming. Apart 
from the trials of daily life, he returns as a controversial figure. 
</P>
<P>
 Many Russians look forward to the reunion; students born after he left are 
even writing essays anticipating it. Older people say they've longed for a 
moral leader of his stature since the death of fellow dissident and 
Nobel-winning physicist Andrei D. Sakharov in 1989. Politicians across the 
spectrum are poised to pounce on his every word as proof of their version of 
the truth. 
</P>
<P>
 But some Russians curse Solzhenitsyn and his writings as a destroyer of an old 
order they miss. Others say he may be returning too late to shape the new one. 
</P>
<P>
 In a country changing so quickly and seemingly so adrift, many Russians ask, 
What difference can any great artist or prophet make? 
</P>
<P>
 "He doesn't have a real understanding of the country he's coming back to," 
says Mikhail Y. Shvydkoi, Russia's deputy culture minister. "Perhaps this is 
because people who live in this country don't have a real understanding of it 
either." 
</P>
<P>
 Some are simply afraid for him. Mail from friends in Russia is running 9 to 1 
against his return, according to his wife, Natalia. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are saying it's a terrible situation now," she reports. "Don't go. You 
are very valuable for Russia, but you won't be safe." 
</P>
<P>
 But Solzhenitsyn, who settled with his wife, mother-in-law and three sons in 
Cavendish, Vt., in 1976, has been planning his return for three years since 
finishing "The Red Wheel," an epic history of Russia on the eve of the 1917 
Revolution. 
</P>
<P>
 His citizenship, stripped away by the Soviet regime, was restored in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Russian President Boris N. Yeltsin phoned two years later with a personal 
appeal to come home. 
</P>
<P>
 Shvydkoi says the government plans "a very honorable ceremony." 
</P>
<P>
 Mindful of his preference for rural surroundings, Moscow's city government 
last year gave Solzhenitsyn land use rights here on the western outskirts of 
the capital, the "dachaland" of past and present Kremlin elites. It also sold 
him the buildings on the 10-acre property, which originally belonged to a 
Stalinist henchman named Lazar Kaganovich. 
</P>
<P>
 The Solzhenitsyns had the old house torn down and a new one built at their own 
expense. One of the two wings will be the family's living quarters, the other a 
workplace and repository of the author's extensive library and archives, which 
will be open to researchers. 
</P>
<P>
 As the family began packing in Vermont last winter, plans to finish the house 
this spring went awry. 
</P>
<P>
 Snowfall on the roof turned to ice, widened the seams between the copper tiles 
and melted into the house when the heating system came on. More water leaked 
into the basement from a poorly insulated outdoor porch. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a disaster," says Mrs. Solzhenitsyn, who came to Moscow to clean up. 
She replaced the architect and the roof, then halted all other work, leaving 
the basement to be repaired this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 "The house is only walls and roof now," she told The Times in a telephone 
interview from Vermont. "There's nothing inside, not even a floor. . . . We 
decided it was impossible to continue the work until we live in Russia. People 
take advantage. You have to be around." 
</P>
<P>
 Until the house is ready, the family will live on Moscow's Plyushchikha Street 
in a five-room apartment that Mrs. Solzhenitsyn bought two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 She says her husband will spend much of the summer traveling around Russia 
"meeting lots of people and listening to them about life today," then start 
writing short stories and playing "some role as a public figure" outside 
politics. 
</P>
<P>
 "He won't recognize the country when he comes back," says Irina Nefedyeva, a 
35-year-old teacher, as she shopped on Plyushchikha the other day. "Everything 
is changing, but it's hard to say in which direction." 
</P>
<P>
 Along the street, a Russian Orthodox church closed by the Communists has 
reopened, but a textile plant is struggling, and two bakeries have closed. To 
eke out a profit, a tiny food shop also sells Japanese-made TV sets and VCRs. 
The newest store specializes in American car accessories. 
</P>
<P>
 A lot of what the author disdains as "squalid mass culture" from the West -- 
novelized versions of the Charles Bronson movie "Death Wish," an Italian TV 
series "Octopus," a Mexican soap opera "Simply Maria" -- is available at the 
neighborhood bookstore, which didn't bother reordering Solzhenitsyn's "Gulag 
Archipelago" and "One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich" when they ran out a 
few months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "To put it mildly, Solzhenitsyn's books are not as popular now" as when they 
were banned under the Soviet regime, says Alexandra V. Nezhikova, who works in 
the store. "When there are none of his books for sale, nobody asks for them." 
</P>
<P>
 Even some of Russia's intelligentsia admit having trouble staying awake with 
"The Red Wheel." 
</P>
<P>
 The political and cultural elite are far more interested in how Solzhenitsyn 
judges 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 Solzhenitsyn laid out some of his views this month in an interview for Forbes 
magazine that was reprinted by the Russian newspaper Izvestia and found some 
common ground with Communists and radical nationalists. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, he suggested that Yeltsin was wrong to privatize farmland and is 
not adequately defending the rights of ethnic Russians in the former Soviet 
republics. He also warned that some Americans want to "weaken Russia." 
</P>
<P>
 Democratic reformers, who have long suspected Solzhenitsyn of autocratic 
instincts, reacted with fear that he will exert a reactionary influence on 
Yeltsin. For his part, Communist Party leader Gennady A. Zyuganov sounds 
encouraged. 
</P>
<P>
 "He will come back and he will not be happy at all with the picture unveiled 
before his eyes," Zyuganov says. "We will gratefully accept his words of 
truth." 
</P>
<P>
 Those inspired by Solzhenitsyn to fight the Communist regime say the most they 
expect of him now is to stay above the political fray and somehow make it more 
civil. 
</P>
<P>
 Lev Timofeev, 57, a dissident jailed in the mid-1980s, credits the author with 
giving his generation "the language of freedom." 
</P>
<P>
 "The most acute problem now is how to find a language of social accord," 
Timofeev says. "When Yeltsin proclaims this, a great number of people dismiss 
it as a political trick. But if such an idea is proclaimed by Solzhenitsyn, 
that's absolutely another thing. I hope that Solzhenitsyn will create this new 
language." 
</P>
<P>
 Russian literary figures of earlier eras -- Dostoevsky and Tolstoy under the 
czars, Pasternak under the Bolsheviks -- assumed such roles as public figures 
and moral critics. But they were present to witness the changes of their times 
for themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "Solzhenitsyn's authority is weakened by his distance from events," says 
Benedict M. Sarnov, a leading Russian literary critic. "He is counting on being 
a guru, but I think he will be disappointed. I would advise him not to come 
back. . . . What Russia needs now is not prophets but pragmatists." 
</P>
<P>
 The debate echoes in Russian high schools, where Solzhenitsyn's works are 
taught alongside those of Pushkin, Tolstoy, Gogol, Bulgakov and Dostoevsky. 
</P>
<P>
 At School No. 1289 in Moscow, 11th graders say it's cool to throw around 
Solzhenitsyn's name, even if they don't actually read him or can't remember 
what gulag means. One classroom discussion turned into a spirited argument 
between two 17-year-olds, Timofei Kiselev and Yelena Sayenko. 
</P>
<P>
 Timofei: "Why is Solzhenitsyn coming back? What can he do here? We have a very 
unstable economic and political situation. The country is not ready to accept 
him." 
</P>
<P>
 Yelena: "We should accept him. He's a genius." 
</P>
<P>
 Timofei: "Sure, but what can he do about our economy?" 
</P>
<P>
 Yelena: "He can help us understand each other, to live in peace." 
</P>
<P>
 Timofei: "Not now. Maybe in the future." 
</P>
<P>
 Yelena: "He'll be dead." 
</P>
<P>
 Timofei: "His books will always be around. But the country doesn't need him 
now. We need first of all not a good writer but good government, economic 
stability." 
</P>
<P>
 Burdened by daily hardships, some Russians view Solzhenitsyn's return next 
week with a what's-in-it-for-me attitude, either cynical indifference or a 
naive expectation that it will improve their material lot. 
</P>
<P>
 Hope is high among the modest villagers who live outside the fence around 
Solzhenitsyn's unfinished dacha. Relieved that it was the great writer and not 
some Mafioso or Kremlin big shot moving in, they are wondering whether he might 
get the neighborhood some gas heating or at least a sewage system. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are looking forward to meeting him and talking to him," says Viktor S. 
Strunkin, a 50-year-old radio mechanic, stopping on the muddy road by a garbage 
dump 100 yards from Solzhenitsyn's gate. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe the authorities will remove this awful dump," he adds. "Maybe they will 
pave this road. I can't imagine that Solzhenitsyn will love having a garbage 
dump right under his nose."

COLUMN ONE; VANISHING MAVERICK OF THE ROAD; ROCK 'N' ROLLING DOWN THE 
INTERSTATE, NORMAN THORNE TRIES TO MAKE A LIVING IN HIS BEAT-UP PETERBILT. 
DESPITE HARDSHIPS THAT HAVE SCARED OFF MANY INDEPENDENT TRUCKERS, HE LIKES 
BEING A REBEL ON WHEELS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN M. GLIONNA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There's something about rock 'n' roll music and the darkened cab of an 
18-wheeler lumbering down the highway at night -- head-knocking riffs from 
Aerosmith, Deep Purple and guitar god George Thorogood. 
</P>
<P>
 For Norman Thorne, it inspires an urge to play air guitar behind the wheel of 
his big rig, shouting lyrics into the darkness that mingle with the drawling 
banter of the CB radio boys and the steady beep of his dashboard radar 
detector. 
</P>
<P>
 It is well past midnight on a stretch of eastbound Interstate 40 in Arizona 
and Thorne feels bad to the bone. He is master of this frenetic freeway 
universe -- moving the throttle through all 10 gears of a powerful 
450-horsepower engine, his cab perched 12 feet above the scattering, 
insect-like four-wheelers down below. 
</P>
<P>
 Owner-operator of the 1984 Peterbilt rig he calls "The Pete," Thorne is a 
long-distance businessman on the road year-round. His office is a 58-foot-long, 
33,500-pound beast of burden that hauls everything from coffee to cosmetics to 
condoms, coast to cloudy coast, on isolated blue highways and big-city 
boulevards. 
</P>
<P>
 In 14 years as a trucker, Thorne has logged enough miles to drive to the moon 
and back five times. He has crossed this vast continent more than 1,000 times, 
wandering through all 48 lower states. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the Great Depression, long-distance truckers have been an integral part 
of the country's heroic folklore -- the road's version of the American cowboy. 
</P>
<P>
 Once a staple of this country's freight-hauling highways, independent truckers 
such as Thorne have become an endangered breed. Fewer than 70,000 strong, they 
represent a fraction of the more than 2.5 million professional truck drivers 
operating today. 
</P>
<P>
 "This truck is Eden to me," he says, lighting another Marlboro. "Being out 
here on the highway is what I want to do. But there are so many things working 
against you. Sometimes, the fact you're even moving with a load of cargo on 
your back, it's a victory in itself." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, on this journey from Los Angeles to Dallas, not a mile marker goes by 
that Thorne does not weigh the frustrations of interstate business against the 
beauty of seeing America through the expansive windshield of the rig he babies 
like a teen-age motorhead. 
</P>
<P>
 At 32, with his blow-dried brown hair and penny loafers, Thorne looks more 
like a lawyer than he does a long-distance freight mover. His boyish charm is 
tempered by a rough, unpredictable edge. He is one trucker who loathes 
country-Western music, sporting the CB handle "Carolina Free Bird," an ode to 
his favorite Southern rock band, Lynyrd Skynyrd. 
</P>
<P>
 He is a ninth-grade dropout who was always curious about the highway life. As 
a boy in Texas he watched the 18-wheelers pass from the back seat of his 
father's 1966 Rambler and always wanted to be riding Up There , blowing the big 
air horn. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Thorne can see potholes in his boyhood dream. 
</P>
<P>
 He is a typical small-time operator fighting cutthroat competition with the 
huge trucking monopolies, a dour-faced David complaining about what he calls 
the government's wrongheaded regulation that threatens to drive his one-man 
firm out of business. 
</P>
<P>
 In the world of long-distance freight hauling, Thorne and other 
owner-operators are like self-employed taxi drivers: commanders of their own 
fixer-uppers and their own schedules, paid-by-the-mile opportunists who must 
hustle free-lance fares without a dispatcher. Most are men, with the occasional 
woman or husband-wife team. 
</P>
<P>
 Theirs is a life of greasy chili dogs, unfiltered cigarettes and strong 
coffee. They are always breathing into a pay phone trying to score the next 
load that enables them to constantly crisscross the country. They are nocturnal 
creatures, driving all night long just to make time. 
</P>
<P>
 Unable to compete with huge companies such as Arkansas' J.B. Hunt, with its 
armies of drivers and sophisticated dispatch systems, independents must nibble 
away at the edges of the long-distance trade, relying on brokers for their 
loads -- an uneasy relationship that makes many drivers distrustful of the hand 
that feeds them. 
</P>
<P>
 Because when you run your own 18-wheeler, there is no time to "deadhead" down 
the highway without a load, no money to spare for extras such as laminated road 
maps and impulsive $50 truck washes. You take showers that come free with 
diesel fill-ups. 
</P>
<P>
 The high cost of fuel cuts Thorne's $150,000 gross annual income in half. That 
and other costs make him ask the operators for refund checks of 75 cents when 
pay phones fail him. At restaurants and motels, he argues for the trucker's 
rate: "I can't believe that's as low as the price goes. All the other chains do 
it. Why don't you check again? Or do I need to speak to the manager?" 
</P>
<P>
 And, at all costs, he avoids the uniformed men at the state truck scales. He 
sees them as itchy-fingered civil servants ready to write him up on a pricey 
violation. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, out here in the middle of the night, The Man looms ahead: 
</P>
<P>
 A weigh station is just over the New Mexico line in Gallup, a roadside trap 
ready to be sprung, one into which Thorne cannot afford to fall. At the scales, 
the steely eyed Department of Transportation cops would surely notice his 
missing mud flap and the fact that he's driving on only 17 wheels, thanks to a 
recent blowout. 
</P>
<P>
 They would slap him with a $68 state fuel tax for big rigs and notice that his 
logbook -- the hour and mileage diary truckers call "the comic book" -- was 
hopelessly out of date. And for all he knows, agents might confiscate the $300 
Radio Shack radar detector -- his main defense against the Highway Patrol 
officers who lurk in the blackness. 
</P>
<P>
 So Thorne takes a detour. A mile shy of the border, he swerves onto a gravel 
back road, heading north toward the tiny town of Window Rock, Ariz. All the 
while, he is banging on the dashboard, resorting to his emergency flashers 
after his headlights momentarily flicker and die -- another minor glitch Thorne 
has meant to fix. 
</P>
<P>
 With Alice Cooper's "Under My Wheels" blaring on the compact disc player, he 
heads to U.S. 666 and on into Gallup. An interstate scofflaw slipping past the 
dreaded scales, he continues his journey toward the diamond-necklace lights of 
Albuquerque and its dramatic high desert sunrise. 
</P>
<P>
 With a wink, he knows he has broken several state laws -- trucker-style: "I 
don't mind paying my fair share but the trucking industry is supporting this 
country's entire freeway system. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's wrong. And I just won't stand for it." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The image of the wildcat driver has been on America's mind for half a century 
-- since Humphrey Bogart played an independent trucker in "They Drive by 
Night," a 1940 cult film. 
</P>
<P>
 Back then, there were no interstates -- it was Route 66 or bust. Long-distance 
trucks were rough-riding rubber-and-iron coffins that lurched along, each bump 
taking a toll on their drivers. 
</P>
<P>
 For generations, 18-wheelers have done America's back-breaking labor -- today 
moving more than 82% of its freight. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a saying," said Todd Spencer, executive vice president of the 
Owner-Operator Independent Driver's Assn. "If you own it, a truck delivered it 
to you." 
</P>
<P>
 But 18-wheelers have changed since Bogart played luckless Paul Fabrini. 
Today's models are high-stepping limousines with air-ride suspensions as 
comfortable as most cars. 
</P>
<P>
 The business is different, too. Competition peaked after the industry 
underwent deregulation in 1980. The resulting rate cuts saw truckers' salaries 
plummet. The wildcatters -- red-eyed loners whose only goal was to put miles 
beneath their wheels -- began to fall by the wayside. 
</P>
<P>
 Independent truckers are no longer just drivers. They have become businessmen 
-- attuned to what they consider the specter of government over-regulation.  
</P>
<P>
 Each year, more than 2 million full-scale truck inspections are conducted, in 
which drivers are cited for anything from a broken headlight to maintaining an 
incomplete logbook. Last year, the average long-distance trucker paid more than 
$350 in fines. 
</P>
<P>
 The way Thorne sees it, the government's newest bit of red tape -- a federal 
ban on radar detectors that took effect in January -- hurts independents in 
particular. 
</P>
<P>
 The ruling, which bans the use of radar detectors in long-distance trucks and 
in buses over 10,000 pounds, was designed to slow down freeway traffic and save 
lives, according to Department of Transportation officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Thorne and other drivers claim the ban is more about dollars -- a thinly 
veiled attempt to increase fines and confiscate what truckers consider a 
critical tool of the road. 
</P>
<P>
 Truckers nationwide have ignored the radar ban, taking their chances at the 
weigh stations instead of giving up their "fuzzbusters." 
</P>
<P>
 When the long-haulers talk about the Department of Transportation, their faces 
contort like a belch from a bad bowl of truck stop chili. "I've got to break 15 
laws just to stay alive out here," Thorne said. "The way I see it, if they want 
me, they're gonna have to come get me." 
</P>
<P>
 Many motorists and road agents see things differently. To them, truckers are 
often arrogant road hogs who place commerce over a much more important concern: 
Safety. 
</P>
<P>
 "We hope that none of our rules are enforced just to make money -- we see them 
all as safety-enhancing," said Stan Hamilton, spokesman for the Federal Highway 
Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 Each year, large trucks are involved in 4,500 fatal crashes and 86,000 that 
cause injuries. The ban could reduce these numbers, officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 Truckers counter that accident rates have dropped over the last decade while 
the number of driven miles has risen. Many have turned to a radar industry 
political action group -- the Radio Assn. Defending Airwave Rights (RADAR), to 
represent them on radar violations. 
</P>
<P>
 But in a move that angered drivers, the American Trucking Assns., which 
represent about 35,000 freight-hauling companies, pressed for the radar ban. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not to increase the bureaucratic burden on truckers," said group 
spokesman John Doyle. "You don't want accidents. You don't want truckers 
avoiding roadside inspections because they refuse to buy new tires or mud flaps 
in a timely fashion. 
</P>
<P>
 "Drivers say they can't afford the regulations. We say: 'You can't afford not 
to have them. Or maybe you shouldn't be in business.' " 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Welcome to the two worst days in the life of Norman Thorne. 
</P>
<P>
 On a steamy Tuesday in Tucson, after driving all night from Los Angeles, 
Thorne arrives 90 minutes late for a 7 a.m. appointment to deliver a load of 
coffee and creamer to a Price Club. 
</P>
<P>
 The sun has already summoned a pungent sweat to his face, making the truck cab 
smell musky, like a crowded airport men's room. At the loading dock, Thorne is 
scolded by a scrawny woman in tight denim jeans who points to half a dozen 
other trucks that must be unloaded before anyone touches his 13 pallets. 
</P>
<P>
 The holdup will jam his schedule and make him late for his second Tucson 
delivery. Now he must drive overnight to make a Wednesday delivery in 
Albuquerque. 
</P>
<P>
 Thorne tries to explain that his truck was loaded six hours behind schedule 
the previous night, but the woman cuts him off: "You're late," she snaps. "That 
means only one thing. You wait." 
</P>
<P>
 For long-haulers, it's a rule of the road: There are no smiles at shipping and 
receiving docks. 
</P>
<P>
 A day earlier, his eyes glued to an electronic broker board at the Union 76 
truck stop in Ontario, Thorne had seen a listing for a coffee load with three 
stops in Arizona and New Mexico. With a telltale beep, the listing had popped 
onto the gray TV screen, ending a frustrating four-day wait in which Thorne had 
cooled his heels like an anxious merchant marine looking for a ship. 
</P>
<P>
 He had to move quickly: Competition for loads is so fierce that a listing can 
disappear in the time it takes to make a phone call. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, Thorne had been lucky. He had reached the broker: He would deliver 
the 41,378-pound load for $1,075 -- or $1.10 per mile, minus fuel. One third of 
the money would be paid up front. 
</P>
<P>
 At the broker's office, he signed a contract -- in effect, buying the entire 
42-pallet load, valued at more than $85,000. If anything happened en route, he 
would be responsible -- so he carries a $100,000 insurance policy. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, Thorne has signed for loads from furniture and cotton to 
hazardous materials, Christmas trees, chemicals for cat litter, dog food and 
hot sauce. 
</P>
<P>
 And coffee. At the Nestle warehouse in Mira Loma, however, trouble had struck: 
A forklift driver told Thorne his truck could not be loaded without wooden 
stacking pallets -- a fact the broker had failed to mention. 
</P>
<P>
 A call to the broker had brought a promise that the pallets would be delivered 
soon. They arrived six hours later. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of leaving Los Angeles with ample time to make Tucson, Thorne drives 
70 m.p.h. across the California desert and ignores a law that says he can work 
only 10 hours a day. 
</P>
<P>
 "The brokers subtly ask you to run illegal," he said. "If I get the load there 
on time, I'm a road hero. But if I obey the laws and get there late, they'll 
remember the next time I call for a load. They'll say I didn't take care of 
them. What that means is that I didn't run illegal." 
</P>
<P>
 If long-distance trucking is a schizophrenic business of hurry up and wait, 
this is the waiting part -- frustrating delays that put drivers hopelessly 
behind schedule. The resulting flip side is the one the public often sees: 
Impatient truckers willing to do anything -- tailgating, changing lanes, 
driving sleepy -- to make up for lost time. 
</P>
<P>
 All night, Thorne had driven like a man possessed: rubbing his eyes, resisting 
stops, checking his watch. 
</P>
<P>
 Near the Arizona line, he had tailgated a four-wheeler hogging the hammer 
lane: "If you're a car in the fast lane doing 60 m.p.h., I'm gonna get on your 
butt. Cars don't realize that I've got 80,000 pounds and 60 feet of truck here 
and I can't stop on a dime. So I'm gonna bear down on you. Then you're gonna 
get the hell out of my way so I can do my job." 
</P>
<P>
 So Thorne arrives late at the Tucson Price Club, its back lot already full of 
semis. The manager says he must wait to be unloaded. Thorne curls his upper 
lip. The product is his to do with as he pleases, he says. And, unless 
attitudes change, the coffee stays on the truck. 
</P>
<P>
 Attitudes do not change. He and his rig lurch away from the loading dock. 
</P>
<P>
 Thorne spends the next 24 hours at a motel, drinking one 32-ounce Coke after 
another, making anxious calls to brokers and other middlemen. Finally, another 
deal is made: 
</P>
<P>
 He will drop the load at a paper recycling yard in the bowels of industrial 
Tucson, where it will be picked up by another driver. 
</P>
<P>
 Thorne is paid for the entire trip to Albuquerque -- no questions asked. And 
so he heads north, bound for a truck stop in nearby Casa Grande, to look for 
another load headed east. Or south. Or north. Even back west. 
</P>
<P>
 He will never again do business with Price Club or the broker. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a truck driver, not a slave," he said, slipping a Tom Petty disc into the 
player. "And I will not be treated like one." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 By the hundreds, the big rigs roll through the parking lot of the Casa Grande 
truck stop with the attitude of runway queens on parade. 
</P>
<P>
 To truckers, semis are indeed things of beauty -- to be pampered with 
multi-thousand-dollar interiors, snazzy paint jobs and chrome "sitting lady" 
mud flaps polished to blind the eye. 
</P>
<P>
 Like pet bowsers, the cabs come in long snouts and the flat-faced variety like 
Thorne's. Their trailers are a mixture of low flatbeds, dry vans and the 
refrigerated variety, known as "reefers." 
</P>
<P>
 Most truckers give their rigs pet names such as "Turtle Swamp," "Alligator 
Eater," "Bucket of Bolts" and "Mobile Studmobile." Thorne usually refers to the 
Pete as "Darlin" or just "Sweetie." 
</P>
<P>
 Suddenly, his eyes widen with envy as he passes the latest model Peterbilt, 
being spit-shined by a wiry 20-year-old with a ponytail. His own truck -- the 
battered war horse that cost him $37,900 a decade ago -- is a decided 4.5 on a 
beauty scale of 10 -- its dull white, unwashed Freuhauf trailer stained by a 
wide swath of diesel and dust. 
</P>
<P>
 In this lot, parking spaces are 60 feet long to handle their oblong occupants. 
Day and night you can hear the hissing release of air brakes and the rumble of 
truck engines always left running. 
</P>
<P>
 With names like Flying J's, Petro and Giant, the nation's 250,000 truck stops 
are a long-hauler's sole haven from the dirt and indignity of the road and the 
narrow gaze of the Highway Patrol officer. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside, there are truckers-only counters, tables and showers. There are 
telephones at every other restaurant seat to cater to the driver's need to be 
on the line -- to his wife or his broker. 
</P>
<P>
 Wall clocks tell the time in Amarillo and Baton Rouge. There are shoeshine 
booths, a hair salon, video game room and a general store selling overpriced 
biker T-shirts, quarts of oil, chrome wheel covers and cigarette lighters in 
the shape of 18-wheelers. 
</P>
<P>
 Waitresses are saucy veterans. They absorb the rudest joke with a smile, or 
appreciate the fact that sometimes you just want to eat his eggs in peace. 
</P>
<P>
 At truck stops, under a smog-like cloud of cigarette smoke, the rule is 
simple: Anything goes. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe it's because there is something lawless-looking about these customers, 
their quiet independence and blatant look of rebellion -- dirty Wrangler jeans, 
handlebar mustaches, unruly beards, tattooed bellies that hang shamelessly over 
large metal belt buckles, and hats that read "Don't Mess With Texas" and "The 
Four Saddest Words Ever Composed: The Bar Is Closed." 
</P>
<P>
 But despite some uncomfortable silences between drivers from competing 
companies, there is rarely trouble here -- unless you count the occasional 
parking lot assault or vice squad arrest of prostitutes known as "lot lizards." 
</P>
<P>
 Mostly, truckers mind their own business, maneuvering their rigs through the 
parking lot with delicate precision. 
</P>
<P>
 For Thorne, the truck stop is a respite where he can shower off the road 
grime, change a headlight and finally slump his body over the steering wheel 
for a few hours' nap -- forsaking the comfortable sleeper cab that would send 
him into a deep slumber that would put him behind schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 Two hours later, he will awaken with a stiff neck and shake his head like a 
jowly cartoon character to ward off any lingering fatigue. 
</P>
<P>
 Then it's time to rejoin the road. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the spot inspections and flash of some Smokey's redtop lights, 
what Norman Thorne dreads most about the road is something invisible: The wind. 
</P>
<P>
 Traveling empty on the highway, wicked gusts up to 100 m.p.h. can topple your 
rig like a Tonka toy. "The wind has no preferences, no hate, no scores to 
settle," he said, hurtling across the Texas Panhandle at night. 
</P>
<P>
 "Compared to the wind, everything else is predictable. It makes you wonder if 
you've got any common sense at all. You say to yourself: 'This is crazy. You're 
risking your life.' But you keep driving." 
</P>
<P>
 Norman Thorne knows. Seven years ago, trudging slowly along a Rocky Mountain 
highway, the wind blew his empty rig over a cliff -- ripping his trailer in 
half and filling his cab with soft dirt as he slid down a steep canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 Trapped in his truck for more than 14 hours, Thorne dreamed of being dead, his 
organs auctioned off at some funky combination hospital and discount store. 
</P>
<P>
 The accident has taken its toll. Injuries took him off the highway for more 
than 14 months. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, almost daily, Thorne is overcome by pain. He takes pills for the 
arthritis in his upper shoulders and the throb in his joints. 
</P>
<P>
 The accident has made him feel his mortality. His trips last six weeks or 
more. The only contact with his family are his wife's daily updates on how one 
of the 4-year-old twins came home covered with ants -- stories that make him 
realize the road is making him a stranger to his children. 
</P>
<P>
 Back in Jarreau, La., a little bayou town not far from Baton Rouge, Debbie 
Thorne is philosophical about the time her husband spends away: "Some marriages 
function better that way. Sometimes it's frustrating when something happens. 
Something breaks, the kids get hurt or I get hurt. Then I get mad. I cry. I 
yell. 'Norman, you're not here. You're never here!' 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think our marriage would have lasted this long if we were an 8-to-5, 
dinner-together-every-night couple," Debbie Thorne said. "We're too stubborn, 
too headstrong. Some trucker's wives are very bitter about their situation. Not 
me." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, it is when he is alone in his rig that Thorne feels most in control of 
his life. He relishes the beauty of the road, the frozen winter wheat fields 
and frosty morning breaths of the cattle wandering the yards outside Amarillo. 
</P>
<P>
 He loves to watch lightning storms hit the desert at night. Driving past 
rainbows that end in the mouths of rivers, he wonders if there is any gold 
under those waters. 
</P>
<P>
 He likes to roll the dice at the Indian trading store near Gallup, where six 
of a kind gives him a free carton of cigarettes. And he loves the fraternity of 
truckers doing their jobs, the comforting flash of headlights that lets him 
know it's OK to return to his lane after passing another big rig. 
</P>
<P>
 Mostly, he revels in the thought of driving the abandoned 3 a.m. freeways of 
Houston, the big Texas curves banking him this way and that as he cranks up Led 
Zeppelin's "Stairway to Heaven." 
</P>
<P>
 All of it outweighs the loneliness of long-distance trucking, the hard 
decisions of paying for that electricity bill or that new truck tire. 
</P>
<P>
 Talking in spurts, he says he wants to forget the image of the frustrated 
long-hauler sweating at some truck stop telephone, fighting with his wife: 
"What do you want from me? Do you want me to quit? Do you want a divorce?" 
</P>
<P>
 Two days later, he will finally touch home for a few hours of sleep and visit 
with his family before the road again calls to him. 
</P>
<P>
 But now, all he knows is this desolate stretch of highway, a place where his 
reasons for driving a long-distance truck are as clear as the Texas night. 
</P>
<P>
 He swings down from the wheel, walks into the middle of the road and stares at 
a sky chock-full of celestial bodies. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look at the stars," he whispers. "God, it's so beautiful, I wish I had my 
camera. Want to know why I'm a trucker? Look over your head. There's your 
answer."

KEY BARRIER TO ALASKA OIL EXPORT LIFTED; TRADE: MOVE COULD CREATE THOUSANDS OF 
JOBS IN CALIFORNIA AND HELP REVIVE PETROLEUM INDUSTRY. CONGRESS MUST OK AN END 
TO THE BAN, WHICH COULD EASE IMBALANCE WITH JAPAN, THE LIKELIEST MARKET. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Secret negotiations have cleared away the key obstacle to lifting the ban on 
export of Alaskan crude oil, a move that could lead to the revival of 
California's moribund oil industry and create thousands of jobs in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 Independent California oil producers estimate that ending the export ban could 
trim more than $2 billion annually from the U.S. trade deficit with Japan, the 
likeliest market for the oil. 
</P>
<P>
 Until now, U.S. maritime unions -- whose crews by law now tanker the Alaskan 
oil to U.S. ports in California and the Gulf Coast -- have opposed lifting the 
ban, effectively quashing congressional action. But the unions have accepted a 
deal in principle that would send the oil to Asian markets on U.S.-flag ships, 
sources close to the talks say. 
</P>
<P>
 That agreement -- reached in recent weeks by the unions and British Petroleum, 
one of the big Alaskan oil producers -- means that Congress will probably 
remove the export ban as it extends the Export Administration Act, a measure 
now under consideration in the House and Senate, according to officials 
familiar with legislative discussions. 
</P>
<P>
 Independent California oil producers and oil companies working in Alaska -- 
principally British Petroleum -- have lobbied long and hard to end the ban, 
which they say floods the California market with Alaskan crude. 
</P>
<P>
 That depresses oil prices in the region and makes it uneconomical to pump oil 
from California fields, the industry contends. Since 1985, 32,000 jobs and $623 
million in state and local taxes and royalty payments have been lost, according 
to estimates by the California Independent Petroleum Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 The ban is "a relic" of 20 years ago, said Dan Kramer, executive director of 
the producer trade group. The export limits -- and the assurance of U.S. 
control of the shipping jobs -- were embedded in the legislation that 
authorized construction of the Trans-Alaskan Pipeline. 
</P>
<P>
 At first, most of the crude made the long journey from Alaska to refineries on 
the Gulf Coast. But in recent years, as West Coast refineries have been 
modified to accept the Alaskan crude, most of the oil has ended up making the 
shorter, less expensive trip to California. 
</P>
<P>
 That, California producers say, forces an extra 300,000 barrels a day of 
Alaskan crude into the California market. Others estimate that the "excess" oil 
is about half that. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials of the Seafarers International Union, headquartered in Washington, 
declined to comment Friday, and British Petroleum executives could not be 
reached for comment. But other sources confirmed the outline of the agreement. 
Most agreed that a pact between BP and the unions would have to be given the 
force of law by Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 Howard Marlowe, spokesman for the Coalition to Keep Alaska Oil -- a group that 
opposes lifting the ban -- confirmed to the Associated Press that some 
coalition members have told BP they would support the deal. 
</P>
<P>
 Exxon Corp. and Los Angeles-based Atlantic Richfield Co., both big producers 
in Alaska, use their crude primarily in their own refineries and distribution 
networks. But BP has long wanted to sell its Alaskan oil to Asian refiners -- 
sales from which the company can expect higher profits. Diverting the Alaskan 
crude to Asia would spur production by California refiners and almost certainly 
raise their prices, which they say are depressed by $2 to $5 a barrel.  
</P>
<P>
 In both states, oil experts expect that lifting the ban would increase 
investment in the industry. But few believe it would significantly affect the 
price of gasoline at California pumps because retail prices depend largely on 
world oil prices. 
</P>
<P>
 BP approached the U.S. maritime unions about a month ago, according to one 
knowledgeable maritime attorney, asking whether they would drop their 
opposition to lifting the ban in exchange for the assurance that U.S. ships and 
sailors would keep their jobs transporting the oil. 
</P>
<P>
 "And as of about a week ago, maritime labor said yes," the attorney said 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. shipping executives apparently agree. "They think they have a better 
chance of utilizing existing boats and perhaps building a couple of new boats" 
under such an agreement "than if (they continue to support) the dwindling 
traffic to the gulf," the lawyer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Many in the Clinton Administration have favored ending the ban, but opposition 
in Congress has been led by the unions and shipping concerns. The U.S. 
Department of Energy has been studying the economic and employment impact of 
lifting the ban, and Assistant Energy Secretary William White is scheduled to 
detail some of the study's findings Monday in Monterey, at the annual meeting 
of the producers association. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier industry-sponsored studies held that ending the ban would create 5,500 
to 15,000 jobs in California and increase production in the state by as much as 
500,000 barrels a day. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the analysis concludes that lifting the ban would benefit independent 
producers, domestic production and the state, I would be a strong advocate," 
Energy Secretary Hazel O'Leary said during a visit to California in February.

REVISED WILSON BUDGET STILL TIED TO BAILOUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL M. WEINTRAUB, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Attacking President Clinton, Congress and his likely Democratic opponent in 
the fall election, Gov. Pete Wilson on Friday released a revised budget 
proposal that continues to rely on a $3.1-billion infusion of new federal money 
that almost certainly will not happen. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson, updating the $55-billion budget he proposed in January, also deleted 
$26.4 million that had been allotted for the state's controversial new public 
school testing program. The governor said he would approve the money if the 
Legislature can agree on a bill to overhaul the test. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson also committed an additional $33 million to pay for the increasing 
costs of state prisons caused by the "three strikes" sentencing bill and added 
$10 million for several new programs aimed at reducing juvenile crime. 
</P>
<P>
 But for the most part, Wilson's spending plan remains unchanged. It still 
rests on the fragile hope that the federal government will come through with 
new funds -- mostly to cover the state's cost of serving illegal immigrants -- 
that would total nearly 10% of the state's general fund spending for the fiscal 
year that begins July 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite signals from Washington that the state will receive nowhere near the 
amount Wilson has requested, the governor said it still is too early to "throw 
in the towel" and give up the effort to wrest the money from the federal 
government. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are politicians in Washington who must be pressured to do what they are 
obliged to do," Wilson said. "If we release the pressure, they will never, ever 
do it." 
</P>
<P>
 But in the first indication that he may relent before the next fiscal year 
begins, Wilson and his aides said the governor will release another revised 
plan in mid-June with a "realistic assessment" of the amount California can 
expect to receive for immigration services. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Democratic lawmakers in Sacramento appear willing to pass a budget 
with a hole in it for the federal government to fill, Wilson has been under 
attack for the idea by state Treasurer Kathleen Brown, the leading Democratic 
candidate for governor. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown earlier this week called Wilson's budget proposal "a lie" and said his 
plan was the equivalent of the state managing its finances with the expectation 
of winning the "Clearinghouse Sweepstakes" contest. 
</P>
<P>
 White House officials say Wilson is overstating the problem by vastly 
inflating the number of illegal immigrants in California and is ignoring 
Clinton's efforts to stem immigration and help the state deal with its fiscal 
mess. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson's comments Friday came after his office released the "May revision," an 
annual event in which the governor updates his January budget proposal. Release 
of the document traditionally triggers the first serious discussion of the 
budget in the Capitol. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, however, that discussion appears likely to be delayed until after 
the June 7 primary.  
</P>
<P>
 Wilson contends that it will cost the state $1.5 billion next year to educate 
illegal immigrant children, $400 million to provide emergency health care and 
$400 million to pay for prison cells for illegal immigrants convicted of 
felonies in California. He also is seeking an $800-million increase in the 
federal share for the state's health care program for the poor, a request that 
has nothing to do with illegal immigration. 
</P>
<P>
 If the federal money does not come through, Wilson said, the state will have 
to make "deep cuts, needless cuts" in just about every program but education, 
which is protected by the state Constitution. He does not want to make those 
cuts until it is clear that Washington will not respond favorably to the 
state's request, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will have a budget," Wilson said. "I think we will have a budget on time. 
It will be an honest budget. But I'm damned if I'm going to let the people in 
Washington off the hook." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson, who in the past has aimed his venom more at Congress than Clinton, 
this time took on the President, who was in Southern California on Friday and 
was scheduled to be in the Sacramento area today. Wilson has no plans to meet 
with Clinton during his two-day stay. 
</P>
<P>
 The governor said Clinton has conceded that the federal government is 
responsible for the immigration problem but has done too little to solve it. 
</P>
<P>
 "He understands the problem," Wilson said. "The understanding is clear. The 
commitment is not." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton, Wilson said, did not create the problem. "He inherited it. But he has 
an obligation to show leadership." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton last year made good on the federal government's commitment to pay for 
the cost of serving immigrants legalized under the federal amnesty program and 
this year has proposed $350 million nationwide for the cost to states of 
incarcerating illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 The White House maintains that it has increased aid to states for immigrant 
services 32% over what was provided by the George Bush Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think this Administration has shown substantial leadership on this issue," 
said Tom Epstein, a White House political aide responsible for California 
matters. "The real battle is in Congress. The burden of leadership falls on the 
governor to persuade Congress to support the Administration's many initiatives 
to help states deal with the problems of illegal immigration." 
</P>
<P>
 White House officials also have noted that Wilson never made an issue of the 
immigration costs when Bush, a fellow Republican, was President. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson also lashed into Treasurer Brown, who this week suggested that the 
state borrow $3 billion over five years to pay off its persistent budget 
deficit. 
</P>
<P>
 "What she has done is to suggest that we take a $3-billion obligation that is 
wrongly and unfairly imposed on the people of California by the federal 
government and that we simply suffer in silence," Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
 He added: "She should fight. She should do everything possible to avoid having 
to do that. I'm not going to throw in the towel. I think she should explain why 
she thinks it's more important to protect the President than the people of 
California." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown did not respond to Wilson's barb but issued a statement condemning the 
governor's revised budget. She has supported the effort to win more federal 
funding but says it is irresponsible to rely on that money to balance the 
budget. 
</P>
<P>
 "Wilson's revised budget is hardly revised at all," Brown said. "It was a lie 
when it was proposed and it remains a lie today. Instead of fixing the problem, 
Wilson is now stalling for time on the political calendar."

PEACEKEEPING; A RED-FACED UNITED NATIONS KEEPS LID ON SOMALIA REPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STANLEY MEISLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 So sensitive did the United Nations deem the report on Somalia that the 15 
ambassadors on the Security Council had to slip into a secretive room high in 
the Secretariat building a few weeks ago and read it on the spot. 
</P>
<P>
 That security has now been relaxed. Copies have been sent to ambassadors, and 
some have reproduced them for journalists. 
</P>
<P>
 But the United Nations has still not published the document -- the official 
report of the commission of inquiry set up to investigate the debacle in 
Somalia last fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the report -- according to a copy now circulating among reporters -- hides 
no bombshells and few surprises and, in general, reaches conclusions that many 
analysts already share about the operation in Somalia. Nevertheless, the report 
is embarrassing, dwelling on many foolish missteps, especially by Americans and 
Italians, in the failed hunt for warlord Mohammed Farah Aidid, and it is 
clearly the embarrassment that has made the United Nations hesitant about 
publication. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission -- Chief Justice Matthew M.S.W. Ngulube of Zambia, the 
chairman, and Lt. Gen. Emmanuel A. Erskine of Ghana and Lt. Gen. Gustav 
Hagglund of Finland -- concluded that Aidid's faction orchestrated the attacks 
that killed 24 Pakistani peacekeepers last June. But the panel accused the 
United Nations of political errors that provoked these attacks and of 
inadequate preparation for the kind of war mounted afterward in the hunt for 
Aidid. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, the commission says that "the United Nations is helpless if 
confronted with the inhumane and unscrupulous means a reckless militia can 
resort to on home turf." 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, the commission goes on, the mandate of the mission -- to disarm 
the factions, by force if necessary -- "was too pretentious in relation to the 
instruments and to the will to implement it." 
</P>
<P>
 The U.N. operation was largely American-run. Retired Adm. Jonathan Howe was 
the secretary general's special representative -- the top U.N. official on the 
scene -- while Lt. Gen. Cevik Bir of Turkey was handpicked by the U.S. 
government to serve as the military force commander. His deputy was Maj. Gen. 
Thomas Montgomery of the U.S. Army. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission describes this leadership and its aides as politically naive, 
largely ignorant of Somali culture and politics and inexperienced in 
peacekeeping operations. For the most part, the report does not identify those 
who may have led the mission astray with their decisions and advice, but it 
does single out U.S. diplomat April Glaspie in one example of an evident 
political miscalculation. 
</P>
<P>
 Glaspie, who served as a political adviser to Howe, was accused by critics of 
failing to stand up to Iraqi President Saddam Hussein when she was the last 
U.S. ambassador to Iraq. But in this case, the report makes clear, she stood up 
to Aidid. 
</P>
<P>
 While Glaspie was substituting for the absent deputy special representative, 
the commission says, the United Nations maneuvered to replace Aidid as chairman 
of a political conference in the central region of Somalia. This angered Aidid, 
scuttled the conference and led to virulent propaganda against the United 
Nations on his Radio Mogadishu. 
</P>
<P>
 On the military side, the commission underscores the problem caused by the 
refusal of Italian officers to follow Bir's orders in the hunt for Aidid. 
Ordered to take a position by force, the Italians instead negotiated with 
Aidid's militia to reach the position. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission also reports that the peacekeepers often marched unwarily into 
ferocious military traps because U.N. political advisers did not keep them 
informed about the political implications of what they were doing. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission also states that the United Nations' problems were made more 
complex because the U.S. Rangers and the U.S. Quick Response Force were outside 
U.N. control yet had a decisive influence on the whole operation. When the 
deaths of 18 Americans in a raid Oct. 3 prompted President Clinton to announce 
a U.S. withdrawal by March 31, "the decision . . . left the United Nations with 
little choice but to change its policy and abandon the hunt for Aidid."

ART; COLUMBUS GIFT SEEN AS A STATUE OF LIMITATIONS; EX-SOVIETS' PRESENT, A 
POLITICALLY INCORRECT COLOSSUS, TRIES TO FIND A HOME IN U.S.

 It's taller than the Statue of Liberty, will cost more than $23 million and is 
in trouble on both sides of the Atlantic. 
</P>
<P>
 A colossal statue of Christopher Columbus by Georgian artist Zurab Tsereteli, 
begun five years ago as a Soviet gift of friendship to the American people, is 
soon to set sail from St. Petersburg to America. All 498 tons of it. 
</P>
<P>
 But America has yet to find a home for the politically incorrect statue of its 
controversial "discoverer," seen by some as an enslaver of native people. 
</P>
<P>
 And some Russians, upon hearing the free-market price tag of the statue -- 
which is to be covered with $18.7 million worth of copper -- are not so sure 
"Big Chris" is a fitting tribute from a nation in the throes of the Great 
Post-Communist Depression. 
</P>
<P>
 The 311-foot behemoth -- six feet taller than Lady Liberty -- could wind up as 
the world's biggest white elephant. 
</P>
<P>
 Tsereteli, 60, is a sculptor to the superpowers. George Bush and Margaret 
Thatcher dropped in at his Moscow studio. The Lenin Prize winner even handed 
President Clinton a miniature of his Columbus. 
</P>
<P>
 Tsereteli's sculptures, which tend to be gargantuan, were frequently donated 
to other countries by the Soviet Union, although his paintings, which some 
consider superior, have rarely been seen abroad. A 39-foot Tsereteli of St. 
George slaying a two-headed dragon, titled "Good Defeats Evil" and made of bits 
of Soviet and U.S. missiles, stands outside the United Nations. 
</P>
<P>
 The Columbus statue is one of a pair originally intended to be presented to 
New York City and Seville, Spain, in time for the 500th anniversary of the 
explorer's voyage. 
</P>
<P>
 Showing a visitor around the sculpture garden of his distinctly un-Bohemian 
mansion that once housed the West German embassy, the artist said Columbus is 
meant as a metaphor for man's striving for a better world. 
</P>
<P>
 "I decided to create a man who would be searching for a new planet, new art, 
new science," Tsereteli said. 
</P>
<P>
 But these lofty plans have been derided in the Old World and the New. 
</P>
<P>
 First New York City looked the Trojan-size gift horse in the mouth and said no 
thanks. Then Miami turned the statue down. 
</P>
<P>
 "A Monstrosity We Could Call Our Own," said the Miami Herald. By this time 
some of the 2,000 pieces of the gift from the republics of Russia, Georgia, 
Kazakhstan and Ukraine had already been shipped to a Florida warehouse, where 
Columbus' head remains. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Tsereteli hopes to place the statue in Columbus, Ohio, but both the Ohio 
governor and Columbus' mayor have said they will not spend tax dollars to help 
install it. 
</P>
<P>
 But a local group of private citizens, the New World Monument Foundation, 
hopes to buy a piece of land on which to erect the statue, said the 
foundation's Karen Hadley. She suggested the statue would encourage friendship 
and trade with Russia that would be worth much more than the cost of its 
metals. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on the government list of "strategic" metals approved for tax-free 
export, Moscow metals-trading companies valued the Columbus materials at more 
than $23 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Komsomolskaya Pravda newspaper published a long article suggesting that the 
project's Russian promoters, at least two of whom allegedly have served jail 
time for fraud, are using the goodwill gift as a cover for exporting excess 
copper and other metals for lucrative resale on the European market. 
</P>
<P>
 If Tsereteli truly wants to make a humanitarian gesture, lawmaker Irina 
Khakamada said, "why doesn't he pay all the taxes on materials he's exporting 
to help his own people too?" 
</P>
<P>
 Tsereteli said he's too busy creating to read his bad press: "If I had 
listened to such things, I would never have been able to create anything in my 
life."

WOMAN ACCUSED OF BILKING WELFARE SYSTEM OF $450,000 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A mystery "mom" who authorities say invented 73 children has been arrested on 
charges of stealing nearly $450,000 in welfare benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 For almost seven years, the woman used forged documents to collect city, state 
and federal welfare benefits for the fictitious children -- including 11 sets 
of twins, Manhattan Dist. Atty.Robert M. Morgenthau said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 As far as authorities know, she doesn't have any real children. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman used at least 15 aliases, and "we don't know her true name," 
Morgenthau said. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman, who appears to be between ages 45 and 60, was arrested Wednesday at 
one of the addresses she used, Morgenthau said. The U.S. State Department 
tipped city officials after federal agents arrested her for passport fraud and 
found indications that she might be cheating on welfare. 
</P>
<P>
 A grand jury indicted her for grand larceny, forgery and filing a false 
instrument. Grand larceny is punishable by up to 15 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Morgenthau said the woman ran the scam from February, 1987, at least through 
December, 1993. At her most frenetic pace in late 1990 and early 1991, she was 
claiming money simultaneously under eight names for 46 children, Morgenthau 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Finkelstein, director of the state Human Resources Administration's 
fraud bureau, said his agency is trying to establish a program to fingerprint 
applicants in an effort to thwart fraud.

DADS' HELP SEEN REDUCING NEED FOR DAY CARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA VOBEJDA and D'VERA COHN, THE WASHINGTON POST 
</P>
</BYLINE>

<P>
 A large growth in the number of fathers taking care of their children while 
mothers work is holding down the need for day care, the Census Bureau said in a 
report released Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The growing role of fathers has had another result too: helping to stem the 
rising number of children home alone after school, even as the number of 
working mothers increased, according to census officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the best-kept secret in American child care: the (number) of men who are 
primary care-givers for their kids," said James Levine, director of The 
Fatherhood Project at the New York-based Families & Work Institute. "The 
reality is that a lot more men are doing this than we thought. It's not glitzy 
and role-reversing, it's necessary to do this." 
</P>
<P>
 The study found that the proportion of families paying for child care fell 
from 40% in 1988 to 35% in 1991, a trend attributed primarily to the increase 
in care from fathers. 
</P>
<P>
 While 15% of preschoolers whose mothers work were cared for by their fathers 
in 1988, that figure rose to 20% over the next three years. 
</P>
<P>
 Census Bureau demographer Lynne M. Casper, one of the authors of the study, 
said the change was due mostly to economics and tight family budgets. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're stretched to their limits now and they can't afford to pay for day 
care," she said. As more fathers became unemployed in the late 1980s, more were 
available to take care of kids. 
</P>
<P>
 And, Casper added, publicity about the poor quality of some day-care settings 
has led some parents to choose to juggle their shifts rather than trust their 
children to the care of others. 
</P>
<P>
 The study, which was the first to report an official number, said there were 
1.6 million, or 8% of grade-school children with working mothers, who came home 
to empty houses. 
</P>
<P>
 A third of these children are under the age of 12 and the income of families 
did not make a difference in whether the child was likely to be left alone, the 
study found. 
</P>
<P>
 Casper cautioned that the figures, while they were the best available to date, 
were probably low, in part because many parents hesitate to admit that their 
children are home alone. 
</P>
<P>
 Census Bureau officials say they believe that the true number of latchkey 
children is closer to 5 million. The larger figure includes children who were 
in child care much less time than their mothers were at work. 
</P>
<P>
 The latchkey-child phenomenon has spawned its own support industry. Not only 
are there classes for children in how to take care of themselves at home, but 
many areas offer call-in lines for youngsters to dial when they're lonely, 
afraid or just want to chat. 
</P>
<P>
 In some areas, especially metropolitan Washington with its high proportion of 
working mothers, the number of latchkey children may be higher.

SINGAPORE MAY BUY 18 U.S. FIGHTER JETS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Singapore is interested in buying 18 FA-18 fighter jets at a cost of $1.5 
billion, the Pentagon told Congress on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The sale would also include spare engines, 268,000 rounds of ammunition, 24 
AIM-9 Sidewinder missiles, 50 AIM-7M Sparrow missiles, repair parts and other 
supplies, a Pentagon statement said. 
</P>
<P>
 Congress has 30 days to block the FA-18 sale. 
</P>
<P>
 Although relations with Singapore have been strained over the recent caning of 
an American teen-ager accused of vandalism, the Pentagon said in its statement 
that the sale "would contribute to the foreign policy and national security of 
the United States by helping improve the security of a friendly country." 
</P>
<P>
 The prime contractor for the sale would be McDonnell Douglas Aerospace Co. in 
St. Louis.

ISRAELI COMMANDOS ABDUCT MILITIA LEADER IN LEBANON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Helicopter-borne Israeli commandos struck deep into Lebanon, abducted a 
Lebanese militia leader and returned him to Israel, the army announced today.  
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman identified the leader as Mustafa Dirani, leader of the Believers 
Resistance, a Shiite Muslim faction.The Israeli special forces team took Dirani 
from his house in Qasr Naba in the Bekaa Valley of east Lebanon as his family 
watched, Israel Radio said. 
</P>
<P>
 The army said Dirani, 46, headed a group in south Lebanon that captured 
Israeli navigator Ron Arad in 1986. Today's abduction was believed to be an 
effort to obtain a bargaining chip to win the release of the Israeli airman. 
</P>
<P>
 A similar operation was carried out in July, 1989, when Israel seized Sheik 
Abdel Karim Obeid, a Shiite Muslim cleric of the Iran-backed Hezbollah Shiite 
Muslim militia. 
</P>
<P>
 Obeid was abducted in an effort to win an accounting of seven missing Israeli 
servicemen, including Arad, who parachuted to Earth near Sidon in October, 
1986, and was captured by Dirani's faction of the Shiite militia Amal. Arad's 
whereabouts are not known. 
</P>
<P>
 Obeid has been held in Israel ever since, but Israel has failed to interest 
the other side in a bargain for the Israelis missing in action in Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
 Obeid's abduction brought international criticism of Israel for acting in the 
same manner as the militias in Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
 Israel Radio said the abduction of Dirani was an attempt to obtain information 
and the eventual release of Arad, the only captured Israeli serviceman believed 
to be still alive. The army said Dirani is being held in Israel.

FIGHTING SPOILS WEEK-OLD GEORGIA TRUCE

<TEXT>
<P>
 Less than a week after the signing of a truce, Georgian troops battled 
Abkhazian separatists along the Inguri River in the breakaway province, the two 
sides reported Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Each blamed the other for the outbreak of fighting Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Abkhazia's military said one of its soldiers was killed and two were wounded 
when about 60 Georgian soldiers tried unsuccessfully to cross the Inguri. 
</P>
<P>
 Abkhazia, a province along the Black Sea once known for its palm-lined beaches 
and resorts, has become one of the worst flash points in the former Soviet 
Union. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 3,000 people have been killed and tens of thousands have become 
refugees since the fighting broke out in mid-1992, when Georgian leader Eduard 
A. Shevardnadze sent troops to quell the separatist movement. 
</P>
<P>
 The Abkhazians, an ethnic group that traces its lineage back many centuries, 
want to become independent or possibly part of Russia.

CRIMEA OKS CONSTITUTION DECLARING ITS INDEPENDENCE FROM UKRAINE; BLACK SEA: 
KIEV PROCLAIMS THE VOTE INVALID AND ISSUES AN ULTIMATUM. OBSERVERS WORRY THE 
CLASH MAY TURN EXPLOSIVE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The defiant Parliament of Crimea set out on a perilous confrontation course 
with Kiev on Friday by adopting a constitution that in effect declares the 
restive Black Sea peninsula independent from Ukraine. 
</P>
<P>
 Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk retaliated by asking Ukrainian lawmakers 
to proclaim the Crimean vote invalid. They promptly issued an ultimatum to 
Crimea to suspend its decision or face unspecified consequences. 
</P>
<P>
 Ukrainian Defense Minister Vitaly Radetsky warned that "Crimea is part of 
Ukraine and we won't give it up to anyone, no matter what it may cost us. 
Everyone should know that." 
</P>
<P>
 Western and Russian observers worried aloud Friday that the fight threatened 
to turn explosive. 
</P>
<P>
 One diplomat in Kiev commented that "the only way Ukraine can stop (the 
Crimeans) is with the use of police power, and that runs the risk of 
confrontation." 
</P>
<P>
 Jubilant Crimean deputies applauded and hugged each other after an 
overwhelming majority of 69 out of 73 present approved the bill restoring a 
1992 constitution, which puts Crimea's relations with Ukraine on a foreign 
footing. 
</P>
<P>
 Toward evening they went a step further by considering an appeal to Moscow and 
Kiev to allow Crimea to move toward rejoining Russia, the Interfax news agency 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
 A worried group of dissidents in the Crimean Parliament warned that the vote 
on the constitution would lead to violence. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am very afraid," said Lila Budzhurova, an ethnic Tatar. "This vote has put 
Crimea on the verge of civil war." 
</P>
<P>
 The Crimean peninsula was part of Russia until 1954, when the Soviet 
leadership made it part of Ukraine, which was then one of 15 republics making 
up the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
 About 65% of Crimea's 2.5 million people are ethnic Russians. Most of the rest 
are Ukrainians. Tatars, who commemorated the 50th anniversary of their 
Stalin-era deportation from the peninsula this week, number only 200,000 but 
wield disproportionate political clout. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this week, Kravchuk cautioned Crimean lawmakers that they were going 
too far, and he showed some muscle Thursday by taking over Crimea's Interior 
Ministry, which directs its police force. 
</P>
<P>
 In Moscow, Russian President Boris N. Yeltsin said he had warned Kravchuk not 
to resort to force against Crimea. He said Kravchuk had assured him that Kiev 
would stick to peaceful means. 
</P>
<P>
 But Russian television reports of commandos parachuting into Simferopol and 
tanks rumbling along Crimea's main roads, though angrily denied by Ukrainian 
officials, added to the sense of threat over the peninsula. Even Crimea's 
separatist new president, Yuri Meshkov, asked the lawmakers, most of whom won 
March elections on pro-Russian platforms, to put off the vote, at least for 
now.  
</P>
<P>
 However, the normally supportive Crimean deputies defied their own president 
by going ahead with the vote. 
</P>
<P>
 They also passed a law requiring Crimean draftees into the Ukrainian army to 
serve exclusively on the peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have no reason to fear Ukraine," declared Alexander Kruglov, a vehemently 
anti-Ukrainian deputy from Sevastopol, to his colleagues. "There are 80,000 
Russian Cossacks ready to defend Crimea." 
</P>
<P>
 While Kruglov's numbers may be exaggerated, the involvement of any Russian 
paramilitary troops in Crimea would escalate the conflict. 
</P>
<P>
 "This will not only lead to a conflict between Ukraine, Crimea and Russia, it 
will lead to civil war here," Budzhurova said. 
</P>
<P>
 In May, 1992, Russia's previous Parliament questioned the legality of Crimea's 
1954 transfer from Russia to Ukraine, thus emboldening its Crimean counterpart 
to declare independence and adopt a separatist constitution that declared 
Ukraine a foreign country and provided for Crimean citizenship and its own 
armed forces.  
</P>
<P>
 That constitution, along with the declaration of independence, was withdrawn 
after Kiev issued an ultimatum. But the March elections produced a pro-Russian 
Parliament far less willing to back down.

the lower house of Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
 The coalition won by a 366-245 vote in the Chamber of Deputies, where it 
enjoys a wide majority. Victory came harder on Wednesday in the Senate, where 
the coalition has just short of a majority, and won by a 159-153 vote.

RECORD MECCA PILGRIMAGE ENDS

<P>
 On the most sacred day of the Islamic calendar, a record 2.5 million Muslims 
attended prayers at Mt. Arafat near Mecca, bringing the annual pilgrimage to 
the faith's holiest shrine to a close Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Emulating a trek made by the Prophet Mohammed, the 7th-Century father of the 
faith, the pilgrims spent Thursday night in the tent city at Mina. At dawn 
Friday, they climbed the granite hill en masse to pray in unison. 
</P>
<P>
 Draped in seamless white garb, the pilgrims came from around the world and 
from different segments of society. Princes and paupers stood shoulder to 
shoulder to recite prayers in Arabic, the language of the Koran. 
</P>
<P>
 Hajj, or pilgrimage to Mecca, the birthplace of Mohammed, is required of every 
able-bodied Muslim at least once in a lifetime. It is one of the five pillars 
of Islam, as dictated by the Koran, the Muslim holy book. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said a record 2.5 million pilgrims were present this year for the 
hajj. There have never been more than 2 million pilgrims in years past.

ROTTING BODIES, GHOST TOWNS DOT RWANDA; AFRICA: SURVIVORS TELL OF SLAUGHTER BY 
MILITIAS. SHELLING AGAIN CLOSES AIRPORT TO RELIEF FLIGHTS. 
</P>

<P>
 A scavenger bird with a sharp orange beak pecked at the ribs of a man who died 
in a roadside ditch. The bird flew off and landed for a moment near the 
sunbaked remains of a baby girl wrapped in a dirty flowered shawl. 
</P>
<P>
 The bird squawked once and flew away again. The village was silent. The people 
who once called it home are dead or gone. 
</P>
<P>
 Across rebel-held southeastern Rwanda such scenes make up the apocalyptic 
landscape: rotting bodies, ghost towns, hungry-eyed refugees resting in the 
shade of looted stores. 
</P>
<P>
 The rebel Rwandan Patriotic Front says the massacres and destruction were the 
work of government-allied militias, driven back toward the center of the 
country weeks ago. Foreigners have just begun to tour the area. 
</P>
<P>
 It is impossible to verify who was responsible for the slaughters, but those 
who escaped say it was militiamen from the majority Hutu tribe who attacked 
with the intent of leaving no survivors. 
</P>
<P>
 Tutsis -- the minority tribe leading the rebel movement -- were the main 
target, survivors said. But any villages resisting the militias or considered 
sympathetic to the rebels were hit, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The militias came through town yelling, 'We are going to exterminate you,' " 
said Dominic Mborombago, a member of the Hutu tribe from the village of Rusumo 
near the border. "I ran into the forest, but was caught in an ambush. They 
thought I was dead and left." 
</P>
<P>
 The blood bath began last month after the Hutu presidents of Rwanda and 
neighboring Burundi were killed in a mysterious plane crash on April 6. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, rebel artillery and mortars outside the capital, Kigali, pounded 
government positions near the airport, closing Rwanda's main link to the 
outside world to relief flights for a second straight day. 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. officials and aid workers believe at least 200,000 people have been 
killed, mostly Tutsi civilians, since fighting broke out last month. Some 
estimates are as high as 500,000. At least 2 million people have fled to escape 
the slaughter.  
</P>
<P>
 Mborombago said he was slashed in the head and leg with a machete April 14, 
eight days after the civil war erupted. His leg gash has festered and swelled 
with infection. He was finally taken to a hospital in Gahini, 35 miles 
northwest, on Wednesday to join the nearly 400 other patients recovering from 
machete and gunshot wounds. Rebel forces guard the compound. 
</P>
<P>
 In the children's wing, a young girl winced when she tried to put pressure on 
her machete-hacked ankle. A few children with similar wounds sat on dirty 
burlap and played with plastic blocks. 
</P>
<P>
 An orphan boy tugged on the arm of a foreigner. "Take me with you," he begged. 
"Take me with you." 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't go," said a nurse. "This is your home for the time being." 
</P>
<P>
 The boy's true home -- and the bodies of his parents -- lie seven miles up a 
dirt road. Sometime around April 10, the villagers of Rukara took refuge in the 
Roman Catholic church. The rebels charge that government militias blasted the 
church with grenades then finished off those who tried to flee with guns, 
machetes and spears. Few escaped. The rebels say thousands died.

OAS ACCUSES ARMY IN HAITI OF CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Soldiers and their allies have waged a four-month campaign of "intimidation 
and terror" that has left 133 dead in Haiti, an Organization of American States 
commission said. It said the culprits should be tried for crimes against 
humanity. 
</P>
<P>
 The Inter-American Human Rights Commission said it verified reports of 
kidnapings, politically motivated rapes, secret torture centers and severely 
mutilated corpses left in the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 "The kind of crimes being committed by the de facto authorities are 
international crimes which would incur individual responsibility," Patrick 
Robinson, a member of the OAS group, said while wrapping up a five-day 
fact-finding mission. 
</P>
<P>
 The five-member delegation reported 133 political executions and 55 abductions 
linked to politics, mostly of supporters of exiled President Jean-Bertrand 
Aristide. 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. human rights experts say the army and its allied gunmen have waged a 
one-sided civil war since Aristide's ouster by the military in 1991. They 
estimate up to 3,000 people have been killed.

MURDER TRIAL LEAK EARNS CONVICTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A retired Canadian police officer was convicted of contempt of court Friday 
because he handed out copies of U.S. and British news articles that contained 
information on a sensational murder case deemed off-limits to Canadians. 
</P>
<P>
 A jury in Guelph, Ontario, deliberated for less than an hour before convicting 
Gordon Domm, 58, of breaking a court-ordered publication ban on information 
from last year's trial of Karla Homolka. 
</P>
<P>
 Homolka, 23, was convicted of manslaughter in the deaths of two teen-age 
girls. She was sentenced to 12 years in prison and is expected to be the 
prosecution's star witness at the murder trial of her ex-husband, Paul 
Bernardo, 29, now under way in St. Catharines, Canada.  
</P>
<P>
 The judge who ordered the publication ban -- which applied to Canadian 
journalists, but not U.S. or British publications -- said it was necessary to 
ensure an impartial jury for Bernardo. Domm argues that it really was intended 
to prevent public discussion of Homolka's sentence.

 Unidentified gunmen shot and wounded the son of Roberto D'Aubuisson, the 
alleged mastermind behind El Salvador's rightist death squads, said officials 
of the ruling Nationalist Republican Alliance, or Arena party.D'Aubuisson's 
son, who bears the same name as his late father, was wounded in the leg after a 
shootout with assailants south of San Salvador. The attack came as D'Aubuisson, 
25, was headed to his home near the capital with his wife and daughter. The 
attack took place hours after the bodyguard of a former guerrilla leader of the 
leftist Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, now a legal political party, 
was wounded in a hand grenade attack in San Salvador.

SOUTH YEMEN LEADERS DECLARE SEPARATE STATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Southern Yemeni leaders said they were seceding from Yemen and declared a 
separate state today, four years after northern and southern Yemen united. 
</P>
<P>
 The announcement was made in a statement read on Aden television and radio by 
Yemeni Vice President Ali Salim Bidh, the country's southern leader. 
</P>
<P>
 Bidh said the new separate state would be called the Democratic Republic of 
Yemen and that general elections would be held a year from now. 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds of Aden's 350,000 residents went out into the streets to celebrate, 
some of them firing Kalashnikov rifles into the air in jubilation. 
</P>
<P>
 Bidh also appealed to Arab and foreign governments to recognize the new state, 
which he said would adhere to Arab League and U.N. conventions. 
</P>
<P>
 The southern decision was made more than two weeks after a civil war broke out 
in the southern Arabian peninsula because of differences between Bidh and 
President Ali Abdullah Saleh, a northerner, over the balance of power in the 
country they merged May 22, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Bidh had ruled the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen in the south and 
Saleh the Yemen Arab Republic in the north until they created the Republic of 
Yemen, the united state of 13 million people, about 2.4 million of them in the 
south. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly before the southern decision was announced today, northern Yemen 
declared a unilateral cease-fire in the civil war starting at midnight, and 
officials in Sana, the capital, repeated a demand for the surrender of Bidh and 
officials in his Yemen Socialist Party. 
</P>
<P>
 The southerners have largely been on the defensive, but the northerners still 
face stiff resistance as they close in on Aden, the old southern capital.  
</P>
<P>
 Diplomats in Aden said the secession option had been under discussion in Aden 
since Monday in meetings of the Yemen Socialist Party and five small opposition 
political parties from north and south. 
</P>
<P>
 They said southern envoys and officials had been discussing possible secession 
with several Arab states that they suspected might be willing to recognize a 
new South Yemen. 
</P>
<P>
 Bidh said that the decision followed "continuous efforts to make unity work" 
and accused northerners of political sabotage, suppression, supporting Muslim 
fundamentalist movements and exporting terrorism. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the new state would continue to aim for unity.

WORLD IN BRIEF; BRITAIN; LONDON CLARIFIES PEACE OFFER TO IRA

<TEXT>

 Britain issued clarifications to the IRA's political ally, Sinn Fein, on the 
Northern Ireland peace plan and said the changes mean there is now no excuse 
for further violence or "playing for time."Sinn Fein said parts of the 
response, the first public document from British ministers to the Sinn Fein 
leadership, were encouraging. The document gave a substantive point-by-point 
reply -- but little ground -- to 20 questions sent last week by Sinn Fein. The 
symbolic concession of replying to Sinn Fein's questions makes it harder for 
the Irish Republican Army to say that the peace declaration agreed to Dec. 15 
by the British and Irish governments is unclear and contradictory.

AT UCLA, CLINTON CALLS ON STUDENTS TO REBUILD NATION; CONVOCATION: THE 
PRESIDENT WARNS AGAINST THE DARK PATH OF NEGATIVISM. HE ALSO STOPS IN SAN 
BERNARDINO AND AT A FEINSTEIN FUND-RAISER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Warning of a nation threatened by destructive cynicism, President Clinton on 
Friday urged UCLA students to take responsibility for rebuilding the nation as 
an earlier generation took responsibility from the ashes of World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton, the featured speaker at a ceremony commemorating UCLA's 75th 
birthday, said that he envies a generation that is beginning its adulthood "at 
the edge of a new century." But he warned the audience of 9,000 at Pauley 
Pavilion that, while he saw a generation of "seekers" before him, they face not 
only wrenching change but a dangerous turn in public attitudes. 
</P>
<P>
 The late Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis and President John F. Kennedy "made us 
believe that citizenship is a wonderful thing," Clinton said. If President 
Kennedy were alive today, however, he would "be absolutely shocked at the 
pessimism, the negativism, the destructive tone of public discourse in America 
today." 
</P>
<P>
 And while he spoke of the future's bright opportunities, he painted the nation 
again and again in dark tones that seemed to suggest his own deepening 
frustration at the attacks on his own programs and himself. 
</P>
<P>
 "This country was not built by bad-mouthing," Clinton said. "We cannot afford 
to engage in the citizenship of division and distraction and destruction." 
</P>
<P>
 He cited linguist Deborah Tannen's contention that the nation has been caught 
up in a "culture of critique." 
</P>
<P>
 "One sure way to get instant public standing in our popular culture is to slam 
somebody else," he said. "If you work on bringing people together and you talk 
about it, you're likely to elicit a yawn. But if you bad-mouth people, you can 
get yourself a talk show." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton was beginning a two-day swing to politically vital California, the 
12th of his presidency. The trip will allow him to attend to several 
governmental and partisan chores. 
</P>
<P>
 He stopped earlier Friday in San Bernardino to talk about defense conversion 
at the former Norton Air Force Base and attended a $1-million fund-raiser 
Friday night in Beverly Hills for Sen. Dianne Feinstein. 
</P>
<P>
 Today he is scheduled to take part in an Armed Forces Day ceremony at 
McClellan Air Force Base in Sacramento before attending a second Democratic 
fund-raiser. 
</P>
<P>
 Draped in gray and black academic robes, Clinton described how the nation 
faced a pivotal moment 75 years ago when newly founded UCLA was a two-year 
teachers' college at the end of a dirt road from Hollywood. Then the nation's 
hottest novelist was F. Scott Fitzgerald, who was writing about a "lost 
generation" that had grown up to find "all gods dead, all wars fought, all 
faiths in man shaken." 
</P>
<P>
 That America, Clinton said, withdrew from the world, refusing to "prepare our 
people to live in the world as it was." He said young Americans should not 
follow that example but the model set by the young people who will be honored 
at the June 6 D-day commemoration in Normandy. 
</P>
<P>
 The invasion of Nazi-held France in 1944 was "the work of citizen soldiers who 
were mostly between the ages of 18 and 25, people who had grown up in the false 
prosperity of the '20s and the bitter prosperity of the '30s," he said. 
Suggesting a parallel with the 1990s, he said, they were "people who read books 
and saw movies that portrayed them as slackers and the future as dark and 
cynical." 
</P>
<P>
 But they "rallied to a cause larger than themselves," Clinton said. And he 
appealed to the UCLA audience to do the same. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton cited California's particular troubles and promise. He said that in 
Los Angeles County, "you've experienced earthquakes of all kinds, not just the 
real earthquake of January but social and economic upheavals." But, calling the 
state "America's last frontier," he said that California is still "America's 
America, the cutting edge of a nation, still a symbol of hope and optimism 
throughout the world." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton said that the nation needs to find a way to restore the more civil 
discourse that prevailed at the time of the Constitutional Convention in 1787. 
</P>
<P>
 The address was one of a series of speeches that Clinton has given this month 
in which he has urged Americans, particularly young ones, to accept their 
responsibilities to their communities and families. With an almost evangelical 
tone, the speeches have suggested that Americans must do as individuals what 
government cannot do for them to rebuild communities that have been afflicted 
with the myriad ailments of the modern age. 
</P>
<P>
 He has called on his audiences to consider child-bearing as a "solemn 
responsibility," to put aside ethnic hatred and to take responsibility for 
their own livelihoods. 
</P>
<P>
 In San Bernardino, Clinton hailed the government and private efforts that are 
turning a 2,100-acre air base into a 1,300-acre facility that will have several 
commercial and governmental uses. 
</P>
<P>
 The base was ordered closed by the George Bush Administration in 1988 and shut 
down for military use last March. This month, the Pentagon announced that it 
had been chosen as the location for a military accounting center that will 
employ 750 people.  
</P>
<P>
 Clinton said that he knows how "a small investment like this can really 
jump-start a whole economy and what it can do to the psychology of a 
community." 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein, sharing the San Bernardino platform with Clinton, thanked him for 
the federal gov ernment's efforts but promised that she would continue to press 
to delay scheduled California military base closings.  
</P>
<P>
 "Some of us think we must importune the President to give us some breathing 
room," she said. "We're going to continue to importune you, Mr. President." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton offered colorful praise to Feinstein and to Sen. Barbara Boxer, who 
also was on the platform, for their efforts on behalf of the state. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you've never been worked on by Feinstein and Boxer at one time, just 
imagine if someone took a huge fingernail file and applied it to your head," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sooner or later, you just say: All right, whatever you want, take it and 
run." 
</P>
<P>
 The local development authority is laying plans for commercial development of 
620 acres of the air base property. Later this year, the federal government 
will give up ownership of additional acres so that they can be used for 
parkland, and homeless and educational facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 The two fund-raisers are expected to raise about $1 million each. The first 
was in a big-top tent erected at the Beverly Hills home of Ron Burkle, a 
grocery chain owner who is a trustee of the Democratic National Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 About 125 party supporters who raised or contributed at least $5,000 were 
invited to a reception with Clinton. For dinner, the group joined another 600 
people who had contributed or raised $1,000. After the dinner, Clinton and 
Feinstein spoke. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein credited the President for his work on behalf of California, saying: 
"I was born and bred in California, and I've never seen a President who has 
cared so much about this state." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton described Feinstein as one of the Senate's most active and influential 
leaders. "This senator, in a remarkably short time, has become a leader on the 
economy, on crime, on the environment and on immigration," he said. "That's an 
amazing record. And she has had the courage to challenge her colleagues and her 
President." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton also defended his 1993 budget, which included a $241-billion tax 
increase. Feinstein's vote for the budget has brought her criticism from one of 
her Republican challengers in the Senate race. 
</P>
<P>
 "My fellow Americans, there are only three ways to get the deficit down: One 
is to raise taxes, one is to cut spending and one is to grow the economy. We 
did all three with this economic plan. Yes, Sen. Feinstein voted for the bill, 
and so did Sen. Boxer, and if either of them had not, we would not have had 
this bill. We would have had more rhetoric," Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
 The night's program was emceed by actress Sally Field, and included music by 
Natalie Cole. 
</P>
<P>
 Proceeds from the Burkle event will be divided among Feinstein's campaign, the 
Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee and the California combined Democratic 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's visit to the state comes amid signs that his popularity among 
Californians has been dropping. The independent Field Poll found in a survey 
released Friday that 38% of Californians think Clinton is doing a good or 
excellent job, down five percentage points from an earlier poll.UNIVERSITY OF

<P>
 President Clinton's address at UCLA on Friday kicked off what school officials 
say will be a yearlong celebration to commemorate the school's 75th 
anniversary. 
</P>
<P>
 The 33,600-student campus will sponsor athletic events, symposiums, 
exhibitions, open houses and addresses by special speakers honoring its growth 
from the "southern branch" of the University of California's Berkeley campus 
into a nationally ranked research institution. 
</P>
<P>
 The upbeat anniversary celebration comes as Chancellor Charles E. Young, who 
is marking 25 years in office, and the Westwood campus have been forced to face 
a number of controversies.

 Young has publicly apologized for his decision to sell 4,000 1994 Rose Bowl 
tickets to one booster, a move that Wisconsin officials and alumni claim drove 
up prices and kept many fans from seeing the game. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA was also heavily criticized for allowing convicted junk bond king Michael 
Milken to teach a class last fall and UC Regents forced Young to get the 
convicted felon to renege on a contract that split profits from videotape sales 
of his lectures. 
</P>
<P>
 The FBI is also investigating allegations that an employee of the UCLA Medical 
School's department of radiological sciences embezzled funds.

<P>
 Last year, Young angered Latino students and faculty members with his decision 
not to form a separate Chicano studies department, precipitating confrontations 
and a compromise to establish the Cesar Chavez Center. 
</P>
<P>
 The chancellor has also waged a tough internal battle with some faculty 
members over his plan, driven by state budget cuts, to combine or 
"disestablish" the schools of Public Health, Architecture and Urban Planning, 
Social Welfare and Library Information Sciences.

 After its establishment as Berkeley's southern branch in 1919, the 
university's name was changed to UCLA in 1927. Its faculty has included three 
Nobel laureates -- the late chemist Willard Libby, who developed carbon dating; 
retired physicist Julian Schwinger, co-winner for new work in relativistic 
quantum field theory; and chemist Donald Cram, for his research in host-guest 
chemistry.

JAMES EARL RAY'S LAWYERS GET COURT'S OK TO TEST-FIRE RIFLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The defense team for the man convicted of killing Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. 
received court permission Friday to test-fire the rifle allegedly used to kill 
King 26 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "We hope to disprove that this was the rifle that killed Dr. King," said Wayne 
Chastain, one of several defense attorneys for James Earl Ray.The attorneys are 
working to throw out Ray's 1969 guilty plea and prison sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 Criminal Court Judge Joe Brown said the 30.06 Remington high-powered 
Gamemaster rifle with telescopic sight could be retested by defense ballistics 
experts and that the bullet fragments could be re-examined. 
</P>
<P>
 When and where those tests will occur has not yet been determined. Two 
ballistic tests, conducted in the months following King's April 4, 1968, 
assassination, were inconclusive because the slug that killed the Nobel Peace 
Prize laureate was too damaged to compare with bullets test-fired from the 
Remington rifle. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutor John Pierotti opposed the request for a retest and said he will 
consider an appeal after discussing the matter with the state attorney general. 
</P>
<P>
 Ray, 66, is serving a 99-year sentence in Riverbend Prison, a maximum-security 
facility in Nashville.

FDA COMMITTEE RECOMMENDS NEW AIDS DRUG; HEALTH: SCIENTISTS ASK GOVERNMENT TO 
APPROVE STAVUDINE, OR D4T, AFTER SOME SUCCESS IN CLINICAL STUDIES. BUT PANEL 
URGES CAUTION REGARDING ITS RISKS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A panel of scientists recommended Friday that the federal government approve a 
new drug to battle the AIDS virus -- but with strong warnings that doctors 
still don't know enough about the medicine to say who should take it. 
</P>
<P>
 An advisory committee to the Food and Drug Administration said Stavudine, or 
d4T, probably provides some benefit over the three existing AIDS drugs. But the 
panel couldn't say just who would benefit, just how safe it was or whether the 
manufacturer was on the right track to answer the many questions. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not sure how good our advice was today," said Dr. Deborah Cotton, a 
Harvard University professor who chaired the panel. 
</P>
<P>
 The FDA is considering whether to permit the sale of d4T under a special 
procedure that allows promising drugs for life-threatening diseases on the 
market before their makers prove definitively that they work. Permission could 
be revoked if the drug maker fails to meet the FDA's conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 The FDA has not said when it will decide on d4T. It is not bound by the 
advisory board's decisions, but generally follows them. 
</P>
<P>
 Bristol-Myers Squibb says d4T appears to help raise the immunity of people 
with the human immunodeficiency virus while causing fewer side effects than 
other AIDS drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, there are three approved AIDS drugs, AZT, or Zidovudine; ddI, or 
Didanosine; and ddC, or Zalcitabine. Each works by blocking the action of an 
enzyme called reverse transcriptase that the virus uses to replicate. 
</P>
<P>
 All cause fairly severe side effects, and the virus can mutate to resist them. 
Some patients experience resistance to AZT, the most widely used drug, as soon 
as six months after starting treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said d4T works in a similar manner. 
</P>
<P>
 But there are major unsettled questions about the new drug: Who will it 
benefit? Are there short-term benefits? Does it increase AIDS patients' 
survival? Are there fewer side effects, as the manufacturer claims? 
</P>
<P>
 The company asked the FDA to approve d4T for AIDS patients who cannot take any 
of the other drugs because of serious side effects or drug resistance. 
</P>
<P>
 It has studied 10,000 such people, giving them two different doses of d4T. 
After a year and a half, 79% are still alive, but 21% have experienced some 
peripheral neuropathy, a painful nerve disorder, which some critics called an 
unacceptable risk. 
</P>
<P>
 But the study, still incomplete, could not prove whether the neuropathy was 
caused by d4T or by AIDS. It indicated that a lower dose of d4T -- 20 
milligrams twice a day -- poses less of a risk of neuropathy. But the advisory 
committee said that evidence was troubling because the patients in another 
study who had the best benefits needed 40 milligrams twice a day. 
</P>
<P>
 The advisory committee said the best test given so far was in 359 patients who 
had taken AZT for six months. Half were given d4T and the rest continued taking 
AZT. Preliminary data shows those on d4T had a very small increase in CD4 
cells, the body's master immune cell. 
</P>
<P>
 The increase -- though only about 20 to 25 cells per milliliter of blood -- 
was significant because the AZT patients saw their CD4 cells continuously drop. 
</P>
<P>
 The d4T patients also experienced a small weight gain and told the company 
through questionnaires that they felt some improvement in quality of life. 
</P>
<P>
 "It just might be that this drug is a better drug than Zidovudine . . . but we 
haven't seen any data to prove that," said Dr. Paul Lietman, an advisory 
committee member and professor at Johns Hopkins University. 
</P>
<P>
 Some AIDS activists said there are still too many unanswered questions about 
d4T. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't know how or when or if to use this drug," said Derrick Link of Gay 
Men's Health Crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 The scientists agreed. They urged Bristol-Myers to study how d4T will interact 
with other AIDS drugs -- because patients commonly take more than one -- and 
how it will interact with drugs they need for tuberculosis and other 
AIDS-related infections. 
</P>
<P>
 They told Bristol-Myers to study d4T in children, women and minorities because 
the studies to date are primarily in young white men.

HOUSE KILLS EFFORT TO CLOSE MILITARY TRAINING FACILITY; CONGRESS: SCHOOL OF THE 
AMERICAS' SUPPORTERS DENY IT TURNS OUT MANY DICTATORS. THEY SAY IT PROMOTES 
DEMOCRACY AND HUMAN RIGHTS IN LATIN AMERICA. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The House of Representatives rejected an effort Friday to close down an Army 
school for Latin American military officers that opponents called a "School of 
the Dictators." 
</P>
<P>
 The 217-175 vote killed an amendment that would have barred the Pentagon from 
spending any money on the School of the Americas at Ft. Benning, Ga. It marked 
the second time in less than a year that the House has backed the controversial 
school. 
</P>
<P>
 The House took the action as it worked on a $263-billion defense authorization 
bill for next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents, led by Rep. Joseph Kennedy (D-Mass.) said the school's graduates 
include former Panamanian strongman Manuel A. Noriega and some of the El 
Salvador officers accused of killing six Jesuit priests. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fact is that this is a school that has (produced) more dictators than any 
other school in the world," Kennedy said. He said it is called the "School of 
the Dictators." 
</P>
<P>
 But supporters said only a few of the school's 58,000 graduates have been 
human-rights abusers and said the school promotes democracy and military 
respect for human rights in Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jesus Christ had 12 apostles, one of whom went wrong," said Rep. Henry J. 
Hyde (R-Ill.). "You wouldn't tell the other 11 to disperse because one went 
wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 House Armed Services Committee Chairman Ronald V. Dellums (D-Oakland) said 
many Latin Americans believe that the school is where "their most brutal and 
vicious oppressors honed their military skills." 
</P>
<P>
 "What better form of symbolism than to say that we walk away from the tyranny 
of training oppressors," Dellums said. 
</P>
<P>
 Church activists who had been fasting on the Capitol steps for 40 days to 
protest the continued operation of the school left shortly after the vote, 
vowing to take their message to the constituents of those lawmakers who 
supported the school. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is disappointing, I must acknowledge that, because so many of us around 
the country have been working so hard," said Father Roy Bourgeois, the 
Maryknoll priest who led the fast. "But I feel that the spirit is strong, that 
our hope will not be diminished." 
</P>
<P>
 Friday's vote was considerably closer than the 256-174 vote last September 
against an amendment that would have cut $3 million from the school's operating 
budget. Although opponents of the school picked up only one vote, supporters 
lost 39. 
</P>
<P>
 In other action, the House rejected, 229 to 166, an effort to terminate 
production of D-5 long-range nuclear missiles for Trident submarines. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton told the House in a letter that termination of the program 
"would severely limit our ability to support the U.S. Trident program which is 
the backbone of the U.S. (nuclear) deterrent well into the next century."

CITADEL GRADUATE TELLS COURT ABOUT DEROGATORY TERMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Cadets at The Citadel were routinely berated with racial slurs and for being 
"weak as a woman," a former cadet testified Friday in a trial testing the 
school's all-male admissions policy. 
</P>
<P>
 "A large part of the names you were called were gutter slang for women," said 
Ronald Vergnolle, a 1991 graduate and former chairman of the school honor 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Vergnolle was the first witness called by lawyers for 19-year-old Shannon 
Faulkner in her federal lawsuit seeking admission to the all-male corps of 
cadets. College spokesman Rick Mill disputed Vergnolle's testimony. 
</P>
<P>
 "We give no faith, stock or credibility to what he had to say," Mill said. "It 
is inconsistent with existing college regulations." 
</P>
<P>
 The Citadel and Virginia Military Institute are the only two all-male state 
military colleges in the nation. A federal judge ruled earlier this month that 
VMI can remain all-male while the state of Virginia creates a separate women's 
leadership program at Mary Baldwin College. 
</P>
<P>
 Faulkner was admitted to the school after she deleted references to sex on her 
application. She was rejected when the school found out she is a woman. 
</P>
<P>
 Vergnolle said he thought women would do well at The Citadel. He said there 
were always women on campus, including professors, waitresses and students from 
other colleges using the library. 
</P>
<P>
 "They never had a negative impact, except you knew they were excluded. They 
could never come into the barracks," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Also Friday, U.S. District Judge C. Weston Houck ordered the state to have an 
adequate remedy ready if The Citadel loses the court case. If the state 
doesn't, Houck said he'd impose one himself.

BABBITT TRIES TO EASE CONCERNS OVER ADMINISTRATION LAND POLICIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt tried to persuade skeptical Western officials 
Friday that the Clinton Administration is not trying to usurp control over land 
management and other natural-resource decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 Babbitt, addressing several governors and dozens of local politicians at a 
conference here, said local input is the only way to resolve a century of 
conflicts over the 500 million acres of federally owned land across the West. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're ready . . . to go back to the grass roots" for solutions, Babbitt said. 
But in what he called a tacit bargain, he said the Administration expects 
decisions to be made with input from all parties interested in the fate of the 
land -- from farmers and ranchers to sports enthusiasts and environmentalists. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the only way of ending this war," Babbitt said at a regional meeting 
here of the centrist Democratic Leadership Council. 
</P>
<P>
 He was talking about the "war" between environmental and industrial interests. 
Another "war" is the one that some Republicans claim the Administration is 
waging on the West. 
</P>
<P>
 The Interior Department alienated Westerners last year with what was widely 
viewed as a dictatorial approach to reforming grazing practices on federal 
lands. 
</P>
<P>
 After a couple of Senate filibusters, Babbitt came back in March with a 
proposal that raised grazing fees less steeply, offered discounts for ranchers 
with good environmental practices and allowed for more local control of 
rangeland policies. 
</P>
<P>
 But the reception has been mixed, at least partly because the first round of 
changes left lingering doubts about the White House attitude toward the West. 
</P>
<P>
 Wyoming Gov. Mike Sullivan said Babbitt heard views of 1,000 people on grazing 
reform at a meeting last year, but "the grass roots got foreclosed" in the 
first Administration attempt to change rangeland polices. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the grass-roots focus may be back, Sullivan said, "but in the process 
something was lost. What was lost was trust." 
</P>
<P>
 Nevada Gov. Robert Miller praised Babbitt for rethinking his position on 
grazing and for being "out here trying to get direct input. It's a presence 
that hasn't been there in the past." 
</P>
<P>
 But he also said there's been little grass-roots contribution to the current 
debate over an 1872 mining law the Administration is trying to change. Already 
both houses of Congress have passed reform bills imposing royalties on mining 
companies, but Western states are still trying to weigh in. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would have liked to have seen a more balanced approach," Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
 Colorado Gov. Roy Romer called the mining issue "very much unresolved. We may 
have differences with the department position." 
</P>
<P>
 Romer was effusive, however, about Babbitt's evolution on grazing reform. 
</P>
<P>
 Colorado provided the model for the pending federal rangeland proposal. 
Babbitt came here eight times in eight weeks to work with state ranchers and 
environmentalists who eventually agreed unanimously on a rangeland policy. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's attempted to respond creatively," Romer said. "I find him moving our way 
in a cooperative spirit."

TEXAS BASE'S REBIRTH SHOWS MILITARY HOLDING ITS GROUND; PENTAGON: CARSWELL IS 
BEING REMADE INTO A NAVAL AIR STATION. OTHER FACILITIES TARGETED FOR CLOSURE 
ARE BEING KEPT OPEN UNDER NEW MARCHING ORDERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ART PINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The big B-52 bombers have already vacated nearby Carswell Air Force Base, a 
sprawling 3,200-acre complex that now looks like a military ghost town. 
</P>
<P>
 Home to much of the nation's now-outmoded strategic bomber force since World 
War II, Carswell is finally shutting down, one of the victims of the Defense 
Department's drive to close unneeded military bases as it seeks to live with a 
declining budget. 
</P>
<P>
 But the residents of this town, whose economy has profited handsomely from 
Carswell's presence, are not so dejected as those in many military-dependent 
U.S. communities. That's because Defense Department officials have found a 
nifty solution for what to do with this redundant Air Force base: They are 
turning it into a naval air station. 
</P>
<P>
 On Oct. 1, Carswell will reopen under the imposing name of Naval Air Station 
Ft. Worth/Joint Reserve Training Base. A sophisticated aviation complex with 
12,000-foot runways and myriad high-tech appurtenances, it will serve as a 
training installation for thousands of Reserve pilots from the Navy, Marine 
Corps, Army and Air Force. 
</P>
<P>
 Carswell is not unique. Elsewhere around the country, the Defense Department 
has converted a naval shipyard into an Army "debarkation center" and 
transferred administrative offices to other former military bases. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense Department officials concede that merely shifting outmoded bases from 
one military use to another could erode the savings they had hoped to achieve. 
Carswell's payroll, for example, will stay at 55% of its Cold War peak, and the 
government is spending $126 million to remodel the base for multi-service use. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics charge that replacing Carswell with a Reserve facility -- rather than 
selling it to the community or private firms for conversion to commercial use 
-- is only a ruse and does not accomplish the Defense Department's purpose of 
cutting back its own expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 "Keeping the base open like this means you still have to foot the bill for the 
most expensive part of the base, such as eating and training facilities," said 
Keith Cunningham, an analyst with Business Executives for National Security, a 
defense monitoring group. 
</P>
<P>
 But Carswell's hometown boosters remain unabashed. Although Derrick A. Curtis, 
executive director of the Carswell Redevelopment Authority, sees the irony in 
the situation, he insists that the reincarnation makes good sense from the 
military's viewpoint. 
</P>
<P>
 While Carswell itself will not be dismantled, Curtis says, consolidating the 
Reserve facilities here will enable the military to close parts of other 
installations -- in Dallas, Detroit, Memphis, Tenn., and Glenview, Ill. 
"They're still saving some money here," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue has taken on broad significance because the White House, toying with 
the idea of delaying part of the scheduled 1995 round of base closings until 
after the 1996 campaign, is battling with the military over how fast and how 
far the shutdowns should go. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior military officers, who have been banking on savings from base closings 
to protect the Pentagon against further cuts in equipment purchases, are 
pushing for a full-scale round of shutdowns in 1995, no matter what the 
political pain. 
</P>
<P>
 "We really need this," Adm. Jeremy Michael Boorda, the new chief of naval 
operations, told reporters in a recent interview. With the defense budget 
declining, he said, "there's not enough money to maintain infrastructure that 
we no longer need." 
</P>
<P>
 But the White House has been under pressure from lawmakers to defer some of 
the shutdowns -- particularly in states such as California, Texas and Florida, 
which are expected to be key battlegrounds in Clinton's reelection campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense Secretary William J. Perry has vowed to keep the base-closing process 
on schedule, but he has hinted that part of the 1995 round of shutdowns may be 
put off if the economic hardships -- and presumably the political pain -- prove 
too severe. 
</P>
<P>
 While some 70 major bases have been officially earmarked for eventual closing 
or revamping, only about a dozen have actually been shut down so far. The rest 
have been relatively small installations, where the savings will not be very 
significant. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, many of the larger bases that have been closed are now being 
replaced -- as Carswell is -- by Reserve installations or other 
military-related operations. 
</P>
<P>
 There are these examples: 
</P>
<P>
 * Charleston, S.C.: Hit hard last summer by the announcement that the Navy 
will shut down its shipyard and other facilities there, it is becoming home to 
a new Army "debarkation center," thanks in part to pressure from its 
congressional delegation. 
</P>
<P>
 * Ft. Dix, N.J.: Ordered shut by the Defense Base Closing and Realignment 
Commission during the 1991 round of base closings, it still exists in force, 
filled with relocated facilities from the various services. 
</P>
<P>
 * Rickenbacker Air Force Base, Columbus, Ohio: Ostensibly closed during the 
1970s, it was immediately reopened as an Air National Guard facility. The 
base-closing commission later ordered it shut down in 1991 but then reversed 
itself two years later. The base is still operating today. 
</P>
<P>
 * The naval air station at Moffitt Field, Calif.: Ordered closed in 1993, it 
is being turned over to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration for 
use as an air base. While the new base will not be a military installation, it 
will still be part of the federal budget. 
</P>
<P>
 And earlier this month, the Pentagon announced plans to "consolidate" its 
Defense Finance and Accounting Service into 25 sites around the country, 
including 20 military installations, many of which are outmoded and had been 
targeted for closing. 
</P>
<P>
 "The reason they do this is obvious: It's a political bone that they can throw 
to the congressmen and local political leaders in the affected communities," 
Cunningham said. "And you wonder why the services don't have any money?" 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Klesson, director of the Center for Economic Conversion, which also 
tracks base closing operations, agrees. "This isn't base conversion," he said. 
"This is just a transfer from one government agency to another." 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, not everything about the base closing effort has been political 
legerdemain. Although few big bases have been closed so far, the law allows up 
to six years from the time that a base is targeted until the day it shuts down. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the delays so far have stemmed from bureaucratic problems, some of 
them associated with environmental cleanup. Some 35 bases are slated to close 
this year alone, with dozens of shutdowns set for 1996 and beyond. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, the services themselves lagged in proposing specific installations for 
shutdown, many until last year's round of base closings, when they finally 
realized that they must cut infrastructure sharply or suffer a squeeze on the 
rest of their budgets. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, many of the bases earmarked in the early days were "easy" choices 
that did not entail much savings. Last year's hit list was far larger than 
those that had been proposed during the 1988 and 1991 rounds, and next year's 
is expected to be even larger. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, while purists may decry it, the law specifically allows the Defense 
Department to use discarded bases for consolidating some of its other 
operations or to turn them over to other government agencies. Indeed, federal 
agencies have first claim to any such property. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, experts say critics have a point when they fret that postponing part 
of the 1995 round of base closings could damage the process permanently by 
placing economic and political considerations above military needs and by 
injecting more politics into the system. 
</P>
<P>
 The base closing procedure -- in which the Pentagon submits a list of proposed 
closings based on purely military requirements and those recommendations are 
then reviewed by an independent commission -- was designed to protect the 
process from excessive political pressures. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the new procedure was put into place, lawmakers had intervened so 
vigorously that the Pentagon had been unable to shut down any of its bases. 
Cunningham warns that if the process is disrupted now, the entire effort could 
become paralyzed again. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Carswell, which got rid of its B-52s and shut down officially as an 
Air Force base only last Sept. 30, is busy getting ready to take on dozens of 
Navy F/A-18s and F-14s, Army C-9s and C-130s, Air Force F-16s and Army 
helicopters in its new role as a Reserve base. 
</P>
<P>
 To the Redevelopment Authority's Curtis, the important thing is not whether 
the Air Force base is being replaced by a Reserve installation or turned over 
to investors for commercial use. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not happening as quickly as we would like," he conceded, "but you want a 
bird in the hand, no matter which one it is."

ABORTION FOES JAM WHITE HOUSE PHONES TO PROTEST BILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANN DEVROY, THE WASHINGTON POST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A dozen key White House offices Friday struggled to continue operating in the 
face of what one official called "telephone terrorism," an organized 
phone-calling campaign to individual offices by anti-abortion forces. 
</P>
<P>
 According to officials in several offices, callers from around the country 
telephoned individual White House officials, most of whom have nothing to do 
with legislation, to protest clinic-access legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 The legislation, passed by Congress and awaiting President Clinton's 
signature, aims at stopping violence and harassment of patients and workers at 
abortion clinics. Clinton was expected to sign the bill Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Secretaries, administrative assistants, clerks and others who answer office 
phones spent the day answering constantly ringing phones. Officials reported 
that efforts to conduct business were stalled, but not stopped, since the 
internal White House switchboard and the main White House switchboard could be 
used for business calls. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, some business callers dialed unaffected offices and got 
transferred to the desired official on unpublished numbers. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said many of the callers identified themselves as being associated 
with the Christian Coalition, but various anti-abortion groups have been 
involved in fighting the legislation. Mostly what they accomplished was 
exhausting lower-level workers.

AD WATCH / CAMPAIGN '94; BROWN, WILSON TRADE CHARGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Democratic gubernatorial candidate Kathleen Brown has been airing a new 
television commercial this week that attacks Republican Gov. Pete Wilson's 
performance as chief executive on the economy, pushing again her theme that she 
is "America's best treasurer to revive America's worst economy." 
</P>
<P>
 * THE AD: The commercial opens with black-and-white film of listless people, 
presumably jobless. A narrator says: "Since Pete Wilson became governor, 
550,000 jobs have vanished." With scenes of Brown at work, the narration 
continues: "With a million Californians jobless, Treasurer Kathleen Brown put 
$7.5 billion of voter-approved projects into action building colleges, 
expanding schools, constructing prisons and providing work for tens of 
thousands of Californians." 
</P>
<P>
 * THE ANALYSIS: Unemployment soared after Wilson took office in 1991, but 
primarily because of the national recession and military-related cutbacks, 
factors over which Wilson had little or no control. 
</P>
<P>
 The evidence that California has "America's worst economy" is arguable. Even 
though the unemployment rate has been running above the national average, 
California remains one of the nation's leaders in the number of fast-growing 
new firms that create new jobs, according to several surveys. 
</P>
<P>
 The notion that Brown put $7.5 billion worth of projects into action is based 
on the sale of bonds, a basic responsibility of her office. Brown had no 
control over how the money from bond sales was spent. The "tens of thousands of 
jobs" might be accurate, but the only thing Brown had to do with it was to sell 
the bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 The statement that Brown is "America's best treasurer" is based loosely on her 
having been honored by one publication as one of the nation's outstanding 
public officials in one year. Wilson aides say that the work of her predecessor 
was better on the basis of the criteria Brown has cited to support her claim. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson began airing a revised 30-second television ad on the immigration issue 
Wednesday. Much of it is similar to a previous ad, but the new commercial 
attacks Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 * THE AD: As does the earlier ad, the new commercial starts out with fuzzy 
film footage of illegal immigrants running across the border in San Diego 
County. "They keep coming," an announcer says. Later in the ad, Wilson says: 
"I'm working to deny state services to illegal immigrants. Enough is enough." 
</P>
<P>
 In the new portion on Brown, the ad says: "Kathleen Brown thinks differently. 
She supports continuing state services to illegals and says legal immigration 
is not a cause of problems in California. Where do you stand?" 
</P>
<P>
 * THE ANALYSIS: Brown has had major differences with Wilson on the immigration 
issue, but not necessarily in the manner implied by the Wilson ad. Brown has 
said that illegal immigration -- and its costs to California -- must be 
controlled, but argues that the most effective way to do it is not to cut off 
services, as Wilson proposes, but to get the federal government to control 
illegal immigration at the border and then to enforce state and federal laws 
that prohibit employers in California from hiring illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 They also differ over what motivates illegal immigrants to come to California. 
Wilson has said they come to this country to get free services such as health 
care and welfare. Brown believes the primary motivation is the search for jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson has proposed a federal constitutional amendment that would deny 
citizenship to children born in the United States to non-citizens. Such 
children then would not be eligible for state health and welfare benefits now 
available to all U.S. citizens. Brown has opposed changing the Constitution.

BABY WHALE IS BACK ON COURSE, SCIENTISTS BELIEVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From a Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A baby gray whale that lost its way while migrating north to Alaska has left 
the Petaluma River and is apparently back on course, scientists said after a 
final search Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The whale, which attracted hundreds of spectators during its five-day Sonoma 
County stopover, was last seen Wednesday night floating near a marina about 
five miles south of town. 
</P>
<P>
 "We surveyed the river by air and by boat and we're confident the whale is no 
longer here," said Joe Cordaro, a wildlife biologist with the National Marine 
Fisheries Service. "We don't know why it came in or how it got out, but we're 
happy this appears to be over." 
</P>
<P>
 A team of scientists spent Tuesday and Wednesday attempting to herd the whale 
downriver and back into San Francisco Bay. When they showed up Thursday 
morning, the whale -- which had proved quite resistant to the rescue effort -- 
was nowhere to be seen. 
</P>
<P>
 The 25-foot cetacean was dubbed Phyllis by some and Petaluma Pete by others 
because its sex is unknown. Its sojourn in the muddy Petaluma River was 
reminiscent of the saga of Humphrey, the humpback whale that spent nearly a 
month cruising the Sacramento River before finally being coaxed back to sea. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hopefully we've seen the last of Phyllis," said Wayne Kipp, harbor master at 
the Petaluma Marina. "It was nice having her, but it's time for her to be on 
her way." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials dismantled their rescue operation Friday but said they would quickly 
reorganize if the wandering whale turned up again.

WOMAN CHARGED IN 1976 DEATH OF INFANT; ABUSE: SUSPECT IS HELD AFTER REPORTEDLY 
TELLING A SOCIAL WORKER LAST YEAR ABOUT THE INCIDENT. THE ILLINOIS GIRL, 1, 
APPARENTLY DIED AFTER BEING SHAKEN.

<P>
 An Irvine woman has been charged with killing her adopted baby daughter 18 
years ago in a case that came to light only after she told an Orange County 
social worker about it last year, police said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Victoria Neal, described by Irvine police as a 44-year-old unemployed interior 
designer, was arrested at her Irvine home Thursday on the strength of Illinois 
indictments charging her with murder or voluntary manslaughter in the death of 
1-year-old Danielle Christine Neal, who died Sept. 2, 1976, at a hospital in 
Peoria, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
 The child, who died of injuries apparently caused by being shaken, had been 
adopted by Neal and her husband at the time, Glenn Neal. The couple, who have a 
14-year-old daughter born to them, later moved to Orange County and were 
divorced last year. 
</P>
<P>
 In a telephone interview Friday, Tazewell County, Ill., prosecutor Kirk D. 
Schoenbein said that in a meeting Victoria Neal and her husband had with an 
Orange County social worker in October, 1993, Victoria Neal admitted abusing 
Danielle. Schoenbein said the woman stunned the social worker by blurting out 
that she was responsible for the baby's death in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
 "It appears that she's been racked by a guilty conscience all these years," 
said Schoenbein. He said Neal told the social worker that she had difficulty 
dealing with crying children, but there is no evidence that her 14-year-old 
child was ever abused. 
</P>
<P>
 The social worker reported Neal's admission to Irvine police, who forwarded 
the information to police in Morton, Ill., where the Neals lived at the time of 
the baby's death, Schoenbein said. 
</P>
<P>
 Illinois authorities reopened the case and learned that Victoria Neal had 
admitted to a Wisconsin physician in 1980 that she had abused Danielle, as well 
as another baby girl the couple adopted in 1979. The second child was 8 months 
old when she was taken to a Toledo, Ohio, hospital in 1979 with a brain 
hemorrhage, Schoenbein said. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Schoenbein, Victoria Neal told doctors in both instances that the 
girls had been injured in falls. Hospital officials suspected abuse in the case 
of the second child, however, and reported the couple to state authorities. The 
child was removed from the Neals' custody, but they were never charged. The 
child recovered from her injuries, Schoenbein said. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the 1980 admission to the doctor, and evidence in 1976 that 
"Danielle's injuries were inconsistent with Neal's statements" to police, she 
was not charged until her arrest Thursday, the prosecutor said. He said he was 
dumbfounded that Neal was never charged in Danielle's death. In 1976, there was 
enough evidence to suggest that the child's death was not accidental, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once we got the information from Irvine police, we looked at all the 
documents generated in the original investigation," Schoenbein said. "We had 
the police reports, X-rays and medical reports. We reviewed them and discovered 
that even then there was enough evidence of possible child abuse. I have no 
idea why she was never charged." 
</P>
<P>
 The child's body was exhumed last November and another autopsy was done, 
Schoenbein said. The girl was reburied, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Neal is being held on $100,000 bail in the Orange County Jail. An extradition 
hearing is scheduled for Monday.

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / CONTROLLER; CANDIDATES VOW TO USE OBSCURE OFFICE TO 
SLASH WASTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARL INGRAM, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 To hear the candidates tell it, the state controller of California is the one 
elected official who can sweep away waste in government, eliminate red ink 
budgets and make the economy bloom again. 
</P>
<P>
 All it takes, these candidates say, is the political willpower and the 
application of lean and mean business practices to make state government more 
productive for taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
 They talk of "performance audits," consolidation, leveraging pension funds and 
clearing away governmental regulatory restrictions that impede economic 
recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 If this is the election year when the term business is supposed to have a 
special attraction to recession-weary California voters, the race for the 
relatively obscure office of state controller abounds with candidates who offer 
themselves as business-oriented. 
</P>
<P>
 One runs her own financial consulting firm. Another is a venture capitalist 
and son of the founder of a national department store chain. A third is a 
retired legislator who wants to slash state spending 20%, and a fourth is an 
incumbent legislator who also operates a dairy farm. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, nine contenders are seeking their party's nomination June 7 to succeed 
two-term Democrat Gray Davis as chief accountant, keeper of the state's 
checkbook and custodian of unclaimed bank deposits. Davis is running for 
lieutenant governor. 
</P>
<P>
 The office is often characterized as performing mere ministerial functions of 
government. However, the controller also belongs to a variety of powerful 
boards and commissions whose actions can decide the outcome of issues ranging 
from prohibiting offshore oil drilling to investing billions in public pension 
funds. 
</P>
<P>
 But it is the auditing function of the controller's office, the so-called 
watchdog role, that candidates have seized upon as a tool of reform to sweep 
away government waste. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the controller's powers are largely determined by the governor and the 
Legislature, his or her discretion in selecting audit targets of opportunity is 
limited by statute and budget. About 90% of all controller audits are mandated 
by state law and the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
 Democratic candidates Kathleen Connell, Rusty Areias and Don Perata and 
Republicans John Morris and Tom McClintock are pounding away at the theme that 
state government is awash in waste and the controller can make a difference. 
</P>
<P>
 Connell, Areias and Morris advocate business-style "performance audits" of 
state agencies that would examine how government is managed, measure 
achievement and recommend elimination of unproductive functions. 
</P>
<P>
 Connell, 46, a financial consultant who served as a housing director in Los 
Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley's Administration in 1977-83, estimated that a 
stem-to-stern performance audit could produce $5 billion to $6 billion in 
savings next year, roughly the equivalent of the state's projected budget 
deficit. 
</P>
<P>
 Connell, who holds six licenses for handling security transactions, is seeking 
public office for the first time. Last fall, she switched her registration from 
"decline to state" to Democrat and has loaned her campaign $1.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Areias, 44, is a six-term member of the Assembly and managing partner of a 
family-operated dairy in the San Joaquin Valley. He argues that in addition to 
performance audits the controller can use his "bully pulpit to shut off the 
spigot to programs that do not work." 
</P>
<P>
 Areias was a member of the "Gang of Five" Assembly Democrats who joined with 
Republicans in an unsuccessful 1988 attempt to oust Speaker Willie Brown (D-San 
Francisco). He helped spearhead the legislative effort to provide emergency 
relief and recovery assistance to victims of the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Perata, 49, the third Democrat, is a veteran Alameda County supervisor whose 
campaign solicits examples of "stupid government tricks" and publishes lists of 
the worst offenders. Perata cites the proliferation of local government 
districts with often overlapping functions as examples of waste he would 
eliminate. 
</P>
<P>
 On the Republican ballot, former Assemblyman McClintock of Thousand Oaks is 
opposed by Morris, a Los Angeles investor in shopping centers and son of the 
founder of Mervyn's department stores. Morris says his experience as a 
businessman will enable him to implement sound business principles in 
government. 
</P>
<P>
 Morris, 36, is seeking office for the first time and has loaned his campaign 
$500,000. 
</P>
<P>
 McClintock, 37, was one of the most fiscally conservative members of the 
Legislature and broke with GOP Gov. Pete Wilson in 1991 when the governor 
advocated increased taxes to help balance the state budget. Instead, McClintock 
demanded deeper cuts in government services, which were rejected by Wilson and 
the Legislature as unpalatable. 
</P>
<P>
 McClintock, who won a court fight to list himself as "taxpayer advocate" on 
the ballot, heads the Center for the California Taxpayer, a research 
organization. He has proposed reducing the state budget by an ambitious 20%, or 
$11.5 billion, including about $4 billion in health and welfare cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 The other candidates are Nathan E. Johnson, a San Diego bus driver, who is 
unopposed for the American Independent Party nomination; Libertarian Cullene 
Marie Lang of Sacramento, and Peace and Freedom Party contenders Elizabeth 
Nakano, a Los Angeles social worker, and Richard D. Rose of Long Beach, an 
organizer for people with disabilities.

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS; WOO SUES OVER REMOVAL FROM MAILER, SAYS BROWN AIDE BOWED 
TO PRESSURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Taking a slap at Assembly Speaker Willie Brown and Democratic gubernatorial 
candidate Kathleen Brown, secretary of state candidate Michael Woo went to 
court Friday in an effort to keep his name on a "slate mailer" endorsement card 
aimed at more than 1 million California Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
 The immediate target of the lawsuit is Clint Reilly, Kathleen Brown's campaign 
manager, who also operates a prominent, for-profit slate mailer called the 
California Democratic Voter Checklist. 
</P>
<P>
 The breach of contract suit, filed in San Francisco Superior Court, charges 
that Reilly succumbed to pressure from the powerful Democratic Speaker and 
dropped Woo from his slate, substituting rival candidate Assemblywoman Gwen 
Moore, an ally of the Speaker. 
</P>
<P>
 Woo failed to obtain a court order Friday to force Reilly to include an 
endorsement of Woo in his mailers, but the suit, which also asks for monetary 
damages, will continue, his attorneys said. 
</P>
<P>
 In response to the suit, Reilly's attorneys argued that "Michael Woo asks this 
court for an order requiring defendants to lie to the public. . . . (Reilly) 
doesn't think Michael Woo is the best person for the job. He wants to endorse 
Gwen Moore, a highly qualified black woman, for secretary of state." 
</P>
<P>
 In a sworn statement, Reilly stated that his decision to support Moore "is a 
political one, not a commercial one," adding that he is losing money by making 
the switch. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this month, the Speaker acknowledged to reporters that he telephoned 
Kathleen Brown about his unhappiness over Reilly's initial decision to carry 
Woo and not Moore. The Speaker said he told her that Reilly's persistence in 
his private business "would be terribly counterproductive ultimately for her 
(Kathleen Brown)."  
</P>
<P>
 The Speaker said that Brown "informed me that that was a separate and distinct 
business, that she would speak to Mr. Reilly, though, and convey my views." 
</P>
<P>
 The Kathleen Brown campaign did not respond to questions about her role in the 
dispute. 
</P>
<P>
 Commercial slate mailers such as Reilly's do not reflect party endorsements. 
Candidates pay to get on them as a way of reaching large numbers of voters, 
often alongside the names of better known candidates running for the major 
offices, such as governor and U.S. senator. 
</P>
<P>
 Woo argued in his lawsuit that he had an oral contract with Reilly. In a sworn 
statement, Woo's campaign manager, Steve Glazer, described negotiating with 
Reilly for a slot on the mailers -- agreeing to pay $90,000 for the 
"endorsement."

MAN WHO AIMED GUN AT DEPUTIES DURING CHASE IS SHOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A man was shot in the legs after allegedly pointing an assault weapon at two 
Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies who were chasing him and two other people 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The suspect, who was wounded about 11 a.m., was taken to Martin Luther King 
Jr./Drew Medical Center in stable condition, said sheriff's spokesman Pat 
Hauser, adding that no deputies were hurt. Authorities withheld the wounded 
man's name. 
</P>
<P>
 The deputy who fired at the suspect was trying to stop the driver of a car 
near El Segundo Boulevard and San Pedro Street when the car sped west on El 
Segundo Boulevard, Hauser said.  
</P>
<P>
 Along the way, the suspect in the front passenger seat threw a package out 
that was believed to contain drugs, Hauser said.  
</P>
<P>
 At Imperial Highway, the driver slowed to about 10 m.p.h. and the passenger 
got out, armed with an assault weapon, Hauser said. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the suspect turned and pointed the weapon at the deputies, the passenger 
deputy fired several rounds from her 9-millimeter duty weapon," wounding the 
gunman, Hauser said. 
</P>
<P>
 The other two occupants of the car surrendered.

CHARGES AGAINST 5 SHERIFF'S DEPUTIES DROPPED; COURTS: PROSECUTORS, WHO MISSED A 
DEADLINE, HAVE SIX MONTHS TO RE-INDICT THOSE ACCUSED OF SKIMMING CASH, BEATING 
SUSPECTS AND PLANTING EVIDENCE.

<P>
 Because prosecutors failed to bring the case to trial within the 180-day 
limit, a federal judge dismissed criminal charges Friday against five sheriff's 
narcotics officers accused of skimming drug cash, beating suspects and planting 
phony evidence.  
</P>
<P>
 However, U.S. District Judge Robert M. Takasugi agreed to give federal 
prosecutors six months to seek re-indictments of Robert S. Tolmaire, John L. 
Edner, Stephen W. Polak, J.C. Miller and Roger R. Garcia on charges ranging 
from theft to civil rights violations. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant U.S. Atty. Michael Emmick, chief of the Public Corruption and 
Government Fraud Section, said his office will review the judge's ruling before 
deciding how to proceed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our plans are to reopen the investigation and to consider re-indictment," 
Emmick said. 
</P>
<P>
 Acting on a motion made by attorneys for the defendants, Takasugi found that 
the prosecutors had failed to obtain a formal order allowing the trial to 
proceed past the 180-day limit. Under the law, the attorneys had until April to 
take the case to trial. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, a federal jury acquitted the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department 
officers on 14 of the criminal counts but deadlocked on 13 counts after a long 
trial. It was the remaining counts that were thrown out Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are pleased," said Roger L. Cossack, attorney for Tolmaire.

COUNTY TO CUT RETIREES' PAY UP TO $280 MONTHLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHYLLIS W. JORDAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ventura County officials agreed Friday to cut as much as $280 a month from 
retirees' pay next year, rather than dip into reserve funds or county coffers 
for the needed funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Faced with tight financial markets and real estate losses in the pension fund, 
the county Board of Retirement voted 7 to 2 to eliminate the extra pay in the 
budget year beginning this July. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't have the money, that's what it comes down to," said Harold S. 
Pittman, the county tax collector and a member of the board. 
</P>
<P>
 County officials argued that granting the $5 million in supplemental benefits 
could force current employees to contribute more toward their retirement or 
prompt the county to cut jobs and salaries. 
</P>
<P>
 Retirees rejected that argument, saying the pension fund has more than $42 
million -- or 5% of its resources -- in reserves that could be tapped. State 
law only requires that 1% be set aside. 
</P>
<P>
 Retirees and current workers both supported a plan to reduce the reserve fund 
to 4%, providing as much as $8 million to pay the supplement benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fund is extremely healthy, there is no reason this could not be approved 
by your board," said Catherine Johnston of the Ventura County Retired Employers 
Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Johnston argued that the pension plan can afford the reduction better than the 
retirees. "To eliminate those benefits is going to create a tremendous hardship 
on those retirees," she said. "They have come to depend on these benefits for 
living expenses." 
</P>
<P>
 Board member Chuck Moore, who favored continuing the benefits, presented an 
actuary's analysis indicating that one year's payment would not affect the 
interest rates or require higher employee contribution rates. 
</P>
<P>
 Current county employees said the board should be able to find a way to 
provide the benefits without raising costs for workers or cutting into 
retirees' pay. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't care how we do it, whether we lower the reserves or whether the 
county steps up to the plate," said Barry Hammitt, executive director of the 
Service Employees International Union, Local 998. 
</P>
<P>
 But taxpayer advocates argued that reducing reserves for a onetime payment 
represents bad financial planning. 
</P>
<P>
 The benefits at issue come as supplement pay, funds beyond the pension that 
county retirees are already due. The retirement board granted one supplement 
benefit in 1977, giving up to $70 a month to pensioners. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The second benefit, approved in 1990, applies only to employees who retired 
before that year. That payment, which can climb as high as $210 a month, was 
intended to make up partly for policy changes that gave the newest retirees 
significantly higher pension payments. 
</P>
<P>
 But the benefits were intended to use up excess funds in the profitable years, 
argued Supervisor Maria VanderKolk, who is also a member of the retirement 
board. 
</P>
<P>
 "In this past year, we don't have excess earning, and that's the crux of 
this," she said. Drops in the stock market have reduced the value of the 
county's fund, and real estate losses have also affected the value. 
</P>
<P>
 "A public retirement plan is not a social program intended to provide 
supplemental benefit as time and circumstances change," VanderKolk wrote in a 
letter to the other supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 Retirees say there is little solace to the pensioners, some of whom rely on 
the supplemental benefits for 38% of their pay. 
</P>
<P>
 "We still come to the bottom-line problem. We're taking money out of people's 
pockets who have come to rely on it," said Hammitt from the employees union. He 
urged the board to find a permanent way to fund the supplemental benefits. 
Board members and retiree representatives agreed to work toward that aim in the 
year ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 Retirees will receive a letter within a few weeks telling them not to expect 
the supplemental pay.

2 IN D.A.'S OFFICE CHARGED WITH FELONY; CRIME: STATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACCUSES A 
PROSECUTOR AND AN INVESTIGATOR OF ILLEGAL EAVESDROPPING ON A CONVERSATION 
BETWEEN A PUBLIC DEFENDER AND HER CLIENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DWAYNE BRAY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two members of Dist. Atty. Michael D. Bradbury's staff -- including a deputy 
prosecutor -- were charged Friday with a felony by the state attorney general's 
office for allegedly listening in on a conversation between a burglary 
defendant and his lawyer in January. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Stacy A. Ratner, a six-year county prosecutor, and 
investigator Katherine Smith have been placed on administrative leave, 
Bradbury's office said in a written statement. 
</P>
<P>
 The case is believed to include the first felony charges ever filed against a 
county prosecutor or district attorney's investigator, veteran lawyers said. 
</P>
<P>
 It also comes less than six months after Bradbury criticized California Atty. 
Gen. Daniel E. Lungren for opposing him in a dispute between Bradbury and Los 
Angeles County Sheriff Sherman Block over an ill-fated drug raid that led to 
the death of a Malibu millionaire. 
</P>
<P>
 "I see that as Lungren getting even, you betcha," said Ventura attorney 
Richard Hanawalt. The charges against Ratner and Smith are the first to be 
filed against a prosecutor and investigator in his 31 years of practicing law 
here, Hanawalt said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although charges were not filed in Ventura County Municipal Court until Friday 
afternoon, word of the impending action left Ratner and Smith's colleagues 
dispirited. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, sources said, senior officials in Bradbury's office held an 
hours-long meeting in which the charges against Ratner and Smith were 
discussed. 
</P>
<P>
 Several prosecutors who were contacted Friday would only say that something 
"very sad" was about to occur. 
</P>
<P>
 Officially, the district attorney's office released a terse, three-paragraph 
statement that echoed those sentiments. The release, which mentioned neither 
Ratner nor Smith by name, read: 
</P>
<P>
 "We are saddened by the news that two of our employees have been charged with 
a crime. 
</P>
<P>
 "The employees involved are fine people who have served the public over 
several years. Both have been placed on a leave of absence with pay while this 
charge is pending. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are confident the justice system will provide a prompt and fair resolution 
of the case for all concerned. "While this matter is pending before the court, 
there will be no further comment by this office." 
</P>
<P>
 The attorney general's office also had little to say. 
</P>
<P>
 In a written statement, however, state officials noted that the matter was 
referred to them by Bradbury's office. 
</P>
<P>
 Ratner and Smith were charged with one count each of eavesdropping on a 
conversation between a prisoner and an attorney under Section 636 of the 
California Penal Code. They are scheduled to be arraigned in Municipal Court at 
10 a.m. May 31. 
</P>
<P>
 The case has been randomly assigned to Superior Court Judge Lawrence Storch, 
who was recently disqualified by Bradbury from hearing any new cases prosecuted 
by the district attorney's office. Storch can hear the case against Ratner and 
Smith because it is being prosecuted by the state attorney general's office. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities began investigating Ratner and Smith after Ventura County 
Sheriff's Deputy Edward LeClair reported on Jan. 19 that he suspected the two 
of wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
 LeClair thought Ratner had ordered Smith to eavesdrop on a conversation 
between Deputy Public Defender Mary L. Fielder and Robert Lee Morrow, 30, who 
is accused of residential burglary. Morrow and Fielder were talking in a room 
that adjoins Courtroom No. 44 in the Hall of Justice about 3:25 p.m. when, 
according to LeClair's report, Ratner looked at Smith and motioned her to the 
holding cell. LeClair is bailiff of that courtroom.  
</P>
<P>
 Smith walked over to a chair about four feet from the holding cell and sat in 
it, says LeClair's report, obtained from court records. LeClair said Smith "was 
leaning forward and to her left . . . to better overhear the conversation." 
</P>
<P>
 The bailiff said he questioned Smith about why she was listening to the 
conversation. "I'm just here to make sure he (Morrow) doesn't go off on her 
(Fielder)," Smith replied, according to LeClair's report. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought this to be very peculiar because any problems in court are usually 
handled by the bailiff or at least the bailiff is informed about possible 
disruptive situations," LeClair's report says. 
</P>
<P>
 The bailiff said that after the public defender and her client finished 
talking, Smith went over to Ratner and began talking to her. 
</P>
<P>
 LeClair declined to comment Friday when told of the charges against Ratner and 
Smith because he is scheduled to testify against them. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Fielder also said that she could not talk because the Morrow case is ongoing. 
Several other members of the public defender's office who asked not to be 
identified said Ratner and Smith have always been ethical in previous dealings 
with them. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorney Hanawalt said it is hard to comprehend the attorney general's 
office seeking a felony conviction against Ratner and Smith. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know Stacy. She is not the vicious type," he said. "For Stacy, it has to be 
a shattering experience." 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Ratner nor Smith could be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Ratner has retained Ventura criminal defense attorney James M. Farley, who 
declined immediate comment. Smith has retained Santa Monica lawyer Stuart D. 
Adams, who could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Morrow, who is being held in Ventura County Jail in lieu of $10,000 bail, is 
charged with breaking into a room at the Marv-Inn Motel in Port Hueneme on 
Sept. 14, 1993, while its occupants were asleep, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 He has pleaded not guilty and asked for a jury trial, which is scheduled to 
begin June 6. 
</P>
<P>
 Ratner was taken off his case as prosecutor after LeClair's report. The case 
has been reassigned to Deputy Dist. Atty. Robert D. Meyers. He could not be 
reached for comment.

 For Maria Teresa Robinson, Friday was the day she achieved her American dream. 
The 44-year-old Mexican immigrant was ending an arduous four-year journey 
toward an associate of arts degree at Oxnard College. 
</P>
<P>
 "I came to this country seven years ago," Robinson said during the 
commencement ceremony as tears welled in her eyes. "It was a time of 
transition, and I had problems and sometimes pain. I did not know how to speak 
English. I had a challenge before me. 
</P>
<P>
 "One day, somebody told me about Oxnard College and I decided to come here. 
That was the day when the sky's doors were opened to me." 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson was one of nearly 300 students who under sunny skies and a warm 
breeze received their associate degrees at Oxnard College. About 400 students 
were eligible to graduate.  
</P>
<P>
 The students were among the more than 2,000 residents who graduated from the 
three Ventura County community colleges this week. 
</P>
<P>
 At Moorpark College on Friday, student body President Mike Madrid told the 
audience that community colleges provide people with less money or different 
backgrounds an opportunity for higher education. 
</P>
<P>
 After high school, Madrid said, he went to work in Arizona, but was troubled 
that he never had applied himself at school. 
</P>
<P>
 "I realized that I was limiting my options," said Madrid, 25. "I came back to 
California, where any resident has the benefit of open access to higher 
education." 
</P>
<P>
 His story was echoed by students throughout the county. 
</P>
<P>
 High school dropout Juli Bennett, 25, was one of 14 students in the Moorpark 
graduating class to have earned a perfect 4.0 grade-point average. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was accepted to Humboldt State," she said with a beaming smile. Touching 
the cap that sat precariously on her head, she added, "I wouldn't have gotten 
in if I hadn't gone here first." 
</P>
<P>
 Her only complaint: "I wish someone would redesign these caps." 
</P>
<P>
 At Oxnard College's graduation, each graduate was given two minutes to speak. 
</P>
<P>
 Many thanked their families, God and friends, but not all expressed their 
gratitude in English. Kim-Chi Vu thanked her parents in Vietnamese, Sachiko 
Nukaya praised the college faculty in Japanese, Erna Satene Lahdenpaa thanked 
her friends and family in German, and Maria Sanchez Serrato praised her family 
in Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
 The ceremony included a color guard presentation by the Naval Construction 
Battalion Center of Port Hueneme and speeches by several college officials. 
</P>
<P>
 College President Elise D. Schneider said that in the past decade, the number 
of Oxnard College students transferring to higher institutions has increased. 
This year, about 251 students plan to continue their education in a four-year 
college, contrasted with 175 last year. 
</P>
<P>
 William L. Shilley, who teaches alcohol and drug education, told students that 
graduation was the beginning of a journey they must carry out with diligence. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is nothing final about graduation. This is simply a time of 
transition," he said. "Transition suggests struggle and pain and the courage to 
meet them." 
</P>
<P>
 One of those on a journey was Jesus Cervantes, 22, who graduated with an 
associate of science degree. He will start a pre-med program at UC Irvine in 
the fall, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cervantes, the first in his family to attend college, said he worked full time 
as a janitorial worker at Channel Islands High School while attending Oxnard 
College. 
</P>
<P>
 "After 3 1/2 years of work, this is like payoff time," Cervantes said. 
"Tonight I am celebrating with my family." 
</P>
<P>
 For others, their years at Oxnard College were enough. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to find out what it was like to be a student or a young person those 
days," said 62-year-old Robert Kelly, a philosophy major. 
</P>
<P>
 Kelly sold his real estate business in 1991 when he enrolled at Oxnard 
College. 
</P>
<P>
 Kelly, who plans to attend Cal State Northridge for a degree in philosophy, 
said he was surprised at the opportunities to learn offered young people. 
</P>
<P>
 "The kids know so much more than I knew at the same age," he said. "If I have 
come this far, I feel comfortable that they will be able to go beyond that." 
</P>
<P>
 More than 1,000 students graduated in Ventura College's ceremony Thursday.

CITY COUNCIL TO CONSIDER PROPOSAL FOR HIKING FEES; VENTURA: PROPOSED BUDGET 
INCLUDES HIGHER CHARGES FOR SERVICES FROM ISSUING BUILDING PERMITS TO BREAKING 
UP LOUD PARTIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Ventura police would charge residents more to tow their cars or for repeated 
calls to break up loud parties under a proposed $103-million budget the City 
Council will consider Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the city initially projected a $1.5-million deficit, the 1994-95 
budget proposal now shows a $543,000 surplus because of increased tax revenues 
and a concerted effort by city employees to collect parking fees and monitor 
fire code enforcement.  
</P>
<P>
 The proposed budget, which would go into effect July 1, includes proposals to 
raise a variety of "user fees" -- charges that partially or completely 
reimburse the city for issuing individual permits or providing specific 
services to an individual or company. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the City Council members say they generally support the higher fees. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed increases include: 
</P>
<P>
 * Doubling the amount the city charges to tow a car, effective July 1, from 
$30 to $63 -- the same amount it costs the Ventura Police Department to provide 
the service. 
</P>
<P>
 * Charging a $218 fee when police are summoned to break up a loud party. On 
the first call in such cases, officers would only issue a warning. However, the 
fee would be levied for a subsequent call to the same house. Currently, there 
is no charge for such calls. 
</P>
<P>
 * Raising most permit fees for large developers, although in many cases such 
fees would drop for residents building their own home or adding on a structure 
to their property. Building permit fees are tiered according to how many homes 
someone plans to build, planners said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the small guy, the little guy, we are trying to help," said Mitch 
Oshinsky, a city planner.  
</P>
<P>
 Even with the fee increases, many services would not cost as much as city 
officials say Ventura pays to provide them.  
</P>
<P>
 The city in many cases would continue to subsidize up to 40% of the cost of 
most services. Officials said they hope to avoid raising city fees so high that 
they drive away local businesses and residents. 
</P>
<P>
 City staff said it is difficult to estimate how much extra money the higher 
fees would bring in because the demand for permits and city services is 
unpredictable.  
</P>
<P>
 Staff members proposed to raise city fees this year after a consulting firm 
monitored the amount of time and effort staff put into accomplishing each 
service for which the city charges. The consultants discovered that, in some 
cases, the staff was erroneously charging more than the service actually cost 
to provide. 
</P>
<P>
 However, as a result of the consultant survey, fees will decrease for some 
services. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, the consultant found, it only costs Ventura about $1,229 to 
process a routine permit application for the construction of a new house, but 
the city was charging a permit fee of $2,030. Planners propose to charge 
applicants 60% of that cost, or $740. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 However, a development of more than 16 homes that must go before the Planning 
Commission or even the City Council costs Ventura about $5,692, planners 
discovered. City staff proposed again charging 60% of the cost -- in this case, 
$3,400. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Ventura City Council members say eventually they would like to see 
developers' fees raised even higher.  
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think it will make one iota (of a) dent in developers coming forward" 
to build in Ventura, said Councilman Gary Tuttle. "That might be an ultimate 
goal here, in my opinion." 
</P>
<P>
 Local developers said that move would backfire on individual home buyers 
because builders would merely pass on the expense. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're not increasing the cost to developers -- they're increasing the cost 
to buyers," said Lynn Jacobs, president of Affordable Communities, a 
Ventura-based development company.

POLICE TO OPEN VENTURA AVENUE STOREFRONT STATION; LAW ENFORCEMENT: TWO OFFICERS

<P>
 After years of complaints from residents that city officials neglect the 
Ventura Avenue area, police said Friday they have completed negotiations to 
open a storefront police station in one of the city's poorest, crime-ridden 
neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 The storefront, behind the Vons shopping center at Main Street and Ventura 
Avenue, will serve the Avenue neighborhood on the city's west end. 
</P>
<P>
 It is scheduled to open in July, with two officers working out of the donated 
retail space, using it as a base for patrols or undercover operations. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many of the people have complained to me for years about feeling abandoned," 
said Ventura Police Officer Jim Cubitt, a 24-year veteran who worked 16 years 
on the Avenue. "This will open up trust and communications." 
</P>
<P>
 The idea behind a storefront police substation is that residents and police 
will trust each other and work together to decide the best ways to fight crime. 
</P>
<P>
 The concept was introduced on a large scale in Houston about a decade ago, and 
has been credited with reducing crime in neighborhoods nationwide where 
repeated police visits were not making a difference. 
</P>
<P>
 Cubitt, who helped obtain the donated retail space, said a storefront will 
make Avenue residents feel more at ease in approaching police officers with 
their problems. It will have a more informal atmosphere than police 
headquarters and officers will encourage residents to drop in. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you walk in there, it will look more like a friendly dentist's office 
than a police station," Cubitt said. 
</P>
<P>
 Avenue residents hailed the decision, but said some of the Avenue's social 
problems cannot be dealt with just by putting more police officers in their 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it can only have a positive effect on the community," said Roberta 
Payan, director of Westpark, Ventura Avenue's recreation center. "It's not 
going to put food on the table, it's not going to give Jim Bob a job, but it's 
a start."  
</P>
<P>
 Residents said they want a closer relationship with police officers and 
welcomed the added feeling of security of seeing more patrol cars in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 "The more in the neighborhood, the better," said Greg Ford, who has lived on 
the Avenue for nearly 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Patty Kellerman, who has been an Avenue resident for 18 years, said the 
station might spur more residents to take an active interest in trying to solve 
the problems in their community. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to do our part," Kellerman said. "We need to take care of the front 
yards, the streets. The police can't do everything." 
</P>
<P>
 The Avenue has historically been troubled by gang problems and drug dealing, 
police said. In recent months, residents were plagued by a series of nighttime 
shooting sprees that caused police to conduct several raids in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 When angry residents met with Mayor Tom Buford and other city officials 
earlier this month, they implored their neighbors and police to help revitalize 
the community. It was at that meeting that Ventura Police Chief Richard Thomas 
announced the storefront would be opened. 
</P>
<P>
 Although some Avenue residents questioned why the substation is not more 
centrally located instead of at the end of the Avenue, Cubitt said he wanted a 
facility that had parking, lighting and easily accessible by several streets. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Cubitt said police officials have been negotiating for months to get the space 
from Dermot Property Associates, a Del Mar-based real estate investment 
partnership that owns most of the Vons shopping center. Dermot officials said 
they hope the increased police presence will also make shoppers feel safe and 
lure more customers to the center. 
</P>
<P>
 For $1 a year, the company will lease the 900-square-foot property to police, 
who are hoping that Avenue residents will come forward to help with tenant 
improvements. Furniture, carpeting and paint for walls will have to come from 
the community, Cubitt said. Trained volunteers will eventually help police 
officers operate the storefront, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not part of traditional policing," Cubitt said. "It's part of 
community policing, where the community accepts some of the responsibilities 
for the problems in the community." 
</P>
<P>
 The Avenue storefront will be the second substation in the city. Police in 
March opened a storefront in Montalvo, which serves that neighborhood and the 
city's east end.

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; HOMELESS MAN DIED OF ALCOHOL, DRUGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE FIELDS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A homeless man whose body was found in a car at a Thousand Oaks park-and-ride 
last month died from a combination of alcohol and drugs, the coroner reported 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Toxicology tests showed that Harrison David Droege had a blood-alcohol level 
of 0.39 and overdose amounts of two prescription tranquilizers in his blood 
when he died, Deputy Coroner Jim Wingate said. 
</P>
<P>
 The two drugs, amitriptyline and nortriptyline, are commonly prescribed for 
depression, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the sheriff's office and a relative, Droege, 32, had been 
unemployed and living out of his car in the Thousand Oaks area for about a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 His partially decomposed body was discovered April 11 by morning commuters at 
a parking lot on Rancho Raod. 
</P>
<P>
 An autopsy failed to determine an exact cause of death. But as a result of the 
toxicology results, Droege's death has been ruled a suicide, Wingate said. 
</P>
<P>
 Droege's last known job was with the U.S. Defense Department's Contract Audit 
Agency in Oxnard, where he worked for several years as an auditor. He is 
survived by a sister in Indiana. JULIE FIELDS

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA PAULA; AFTER 41 YEARS, MINISTER TO BID FINAL 
FAREWELL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF McDONALD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Post-war America was booming and Ike was in the White House. 
</P>
<P>
 A young minister assigned to his first congregation was traveling to Santa 
Paula, a small but bustling farm town he had never heard of. 
</P>
<P>
 "As we came down the valley I said to my wife, 'I wish I was a doctor so we 
could stay,' " said the Rev. Thomas Bousman, who on Sunday tomorrow will 
deliver his final sermon to loyal parishioners, more than four decades after he 
first drive into town. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very unusual for one clergyman to devote his entire professional career 
to one congregation," Bousman said. "I was 24 when I came, now I'm 65 and 
retiring. My whole adult life has been centered in this church family." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1953, Bousman, with his wife, Ellie, moved to Santa Paula to head the First 
Presbyterian Church. He never left. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I first got here, you didn't need to go out of town for anything," 
Bousman said. "All the major chains were here. There were three excellent dime 
stores on Main Street. Now we have to drive to Ventura." 
</P>
<P>
 Through four decades, Bousman has preached, ministered and counseled his 
congregation of more than 300. He has baptized them, married them and buried 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 He will officiate at the weddings of three young couples today. Then during 
his sermon Sunday, he will say goodby the best way he knows. 
</P>
<P>
 "My sermon is going to be called 'The Past Is Prologue,' " Bousman said. "I'm 
going to talk about gratitude for the past and the challenge for the future. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an opportunity to look back and be grateful for all the good things, 
but also for looking forward to all the wonderful things that can happen," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bousman has preached to his Santa Paula neighbors for so long, many wonder 
what it will be like to have a new minister in town. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have two children and he performed the wedding service for both of them," 
said Louise Saviers, a secretary in the church for 15 years and a member of the 
congregation for even longer. 
</P>
<P>
 "He performed the funeral service for my father, who died after an extended 
illness, and comforted me a lot in my times of sorrow," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 By Monday, the Bousmans will be in Yosemite, one of their favorite vacation 
spots. This summer, they will travel to Norway to visit their oldest daughter, 
Peggy. Parishioners chipped in to buy them a Norwegian cruise. 
</P>
<P>
 Ellie Bousman, the minister's wife of 43 years, said it will be difficult 
adjusting to retirement. 
</P>
<P>
 "Both of us grew up here," she said. "It's been our home and work and joys and 
sorrow for all these years." JEFF McDONALD

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: NEWBURY PARK; NO CITATIONS FILED IN CAR, BICYCLE 
COLLISION

<TEXT>
<P>
 California Highway Patrol officers have not yet decided whether to cite a 
Newbury Park woman who crossed over double yellow lines on Potrero Road in 
Newbury Park and struck a bicyclist, critically injuring him. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the CHP, Martha Lane, 54, was passing another vehicle on a curve 
Thursday morning, when her car hit Walter Tupper, 26, who was bicycling toward 
her from the opposite direction. 
</P>
<P>
 Tupper of Port Hueneme suffered head, abdominal and knee injuries, authorities 
said. He remained in critical condition at Pleasant Valley Hospital on Friday 
after undergoing surgery to remove a kidney. Tupper also suffered broken bones 
and damage to vital organs, hospital officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time of the collision, Lane was driving under 35 m.p.h., CHP Officer 
Dave Wigton said. The accident is still being investigated, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are no independent witnesses," Wigton said. "And that makes it kind of 
hard. It's one of those 'he said, she said' situations." PEGGY Y. LEE

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: MOORPARK; COUNCIL OKS LAW ON PRICE GOUGING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HADLY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Disturbed by reports of price gouging in the county after the earthquake, the 
Moorpark City Council has approved a new law to prevent steep markups on items 
such as food, water, lumber and medical supplies during local emergencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Similar to ordinances in Thousand Oaks and Simi Valley, the new law prevents 
vendors from hiking prices by more than 10% on emergency items after a disaster 
is declared. 
</P>
<P>
 The list of affected items is long and includes such essentials as first-aid 
kits, flashlights, diapers and batteries. 
</P>
<P>
 While county prosecutors received reports of price gouging in other parts of 
the county, Moorpark officials said it was not a problem in their city. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think it was a real issue here after the earthquake," said Barbara 
Coy-Bullicz, a city management analyst who drew up the ordinance. "But we've 
been encouraged by the district attorney's office to pass such an ordinance to 
prevent price gouging from ever happening here." SCOTT HADLY

<TEXT>
<P>
 Four months after the devastating Northridge earthquake, the Moorpark City 
Council is requesting that the Federal Emergency Management Agency pay for the 
demolition of an 80-year-old market knocked off its foundation during the 
temblor. 
</P>
<P>
 The city is requesting that FEMA pay $29,000 as the cost of demolishing the 
Mayflower Market on High Street and a wall at the Metrolink station. 
</P>
<P>
 Rifaat Hijaz, owner of the 20-year-old family business, said he is eager to 
have the building razed. 
</P>
<P>
 "The sooner they take it down the better," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hijaz has operated the market out of a nearby storage shed. His family is 
eager to rebuild, but is still waiting on a $300,000 low-interest disaster loan 
from the U.S. Small Business Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't know why it's taking so long, I wish I knew," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 "At least the city has been helpful." SCOTT HADLY

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; YOUNG WRITERS' FAIR TO BE HELD TODAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 To showcase the work of Ventura's youngest writers, the Ventura Unified School 
District is holding a writers' fair today that will feature puppet shows, talks 
by children's authors and exhibits by local students. 
</P>
<P>
 The seventh annual Young Writers' Fair will run from 9 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. at 
Cabrillo Middle School, 1426 E. Santa Clara St. 
</P>
<P>
 The fair will feature a display of works by more than 5,000 Ventura students 
in preschool through 12th grade, including mobiles made by young children and 
poems written by older pupils. 
</P>
<P>
 Three authors will give talks. Sneed Collard, who writes nonfiction children's 
books on animals and the environment, will give a slide presentation and 
discuss the writing process he is following in his current project about the 
Costa Rican rain forest. Authors Elizabeth King, who wrote an award-winning 
book called "Backyard Sunflower," and Joel Matus, whose latest book is called 
"Leroy and the Cavemen," will also participate. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura school officials launched the fair to put more emphasis on writing in 
classrooms throughout the district, said Jean Eaton, a teacher at Junipero 
Serra School. 
</P>
<P>
 The district has continued the fair "to show the public what wonderful things 
the students are doing," Eaton said. MAIA DAVIS

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: CAMARILLO; RACIST LEAFLETS FOUND AT SCHOOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 School officials on Thursday found racist flyers crammed into lockers at 
Adolpho Camarillo High School, the seventh time this year that such leaflets 
have been distributed at campuses in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities suspect the latest incident is related to the others because the 
flyers are identical.Investigators have no leads or suspects, Ventura County 
Sheriff's Sgt. Keith Lazz said. 
</P>
<P>
 The flyers were discovered about 7:30 a.m., when students arrived at the 
school and saw them in their lockers, Principal Terry Tackett said. Officials 
know they were distributed after midnight Wednesday, because maintenance crews 
work until then, Tackett said. 
</P>
<P>
 The handouts criticize whites who marry members of minority groups and 
advocate driving minorities out of the United States. The message ends with a 
Los Angeles County phone number, which leads to a recording that claims 
affiliation to the White Aryan Resistance, or WAR, a white separatist group. 
</P>
<P>
 "The students were very unhappy, very concerned," Tackett said. "They 
understand it was the act of a few thoughtless people." 
</P>
<P>
 Tackett said school officials will hire private security guards to patrol the 
campus late at night. 
</P>
<P>
 The flyers began appearing at Ventura County schools in December, when 
hundreds were found in lockers at Simi Valley High School. Flyers were also 
distributed at Matilija Junior High School, Westlake, Royal, Buena, Nordhoff 
and Thousand Oaks high schools this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Police arrested Allan Carlson, 30, of Glendale in December at Simi Valley High 
on suspicion of trespassing and punching a janitor who told him to leave the 
campus, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Carlson is not being prosecuted for distributing the pamphlets, which are 
protected by the U.S. Constitution's guarantee of free speech, Simi Valley 
Police Detective Kathy Vigil said. Carlson's trial on assault and trespassing 
charges is pending, Vigil said. PEGGY Y. LEE

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: RETIRING FOOD BANK DIRECTOR TO BE HONORED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRISTINA LIMA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After 17 years at Ventura County's largest food bank, 67-year-old Lillah Jewel 
Pedi has retired, leaving behind an agency that distributes $11 million a year 
in food to 127,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
 Pedi, retiring executive director of Food Share, will be honored at a dinner 
today at the Poinsettia Pavilion in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 Pedi has played a major role in bringing the food bank from a two-garage 
operation into a 1,200-square-foot warehouse, friends said. 
</P>
<P>
 "But her biggest contribution has been the lives she's touched through the 
years," said Jim Mangis, the new executive director of Food Share. "She has 
such a wonderful spirit and she touches and inspires everyone with it." 
</P>
<P>
 Pedi said she is particularly pleased that Food Share is debt-free and 
described it is one of the best-organized food banks in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 She has been with the organization since 1978, when a group of volunteers at 
the South Coast Fellowship Faith Center in Ventura began to collect food and 
distribute it. 
</P>
<P>
 They operated from a two-car garage before moving into a Saticoy fire station 
and six years ago to a warehouse in Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 After Pedi became the organization's executive director, she managed to get a 
$1-million grant to pay off the warehouse, buy a lot next to it and buy two 
vans to deliver food. 
</P>
<P>
 "My work was meant to help mankind in one way or another," Pedi said. "I think 
I basically made it easier for those who are less fortunate in the county."

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: POLICE HONOR OFFICERS KILLED IN LINE OF DUTY 
</P>

<P>
 Stretching a half-inch strip of black elastic across their brass badges, law 
enforcement officials in Ventura County joined peace officers nationwide Friday 
in honoring men and women who have died in the line of duty. 
</P>
<P>
 In a period marked by increasing violence against police officers, including 
the fatal shooting of an Oxnard officer last December, the observance held 
special meaning for many. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have one day for our soldiers and sailors, and the combat that our police 
officers engage in is no less deadly," Oxnard Police Sgt. Fred Berry said. 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard patrol cars and motorcycles drove with their headlights on Friday 
afternoon in a symbolic gesture of remembrance of Oxnard Detective James E. 
O'Brien and others killed in the line of duty, Berry said. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Brien was gunned down Dec. 2 after a Ventura man's deadly rampage at an 
Oxnard jobs office. He was one of nine officers in Southern California shot to 
death in the line of duty last year. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Port Hueneme Police Department, where O'Brien once served, the black 
elastic band was a reminder of a fallen friend. 
</P>
<P>
 "This has a very special meaning this year," Sgt. Jerry Beck said. "Jimmy was 
a member of this department for a long time." 
</P>
<P>
 Port Hueneme, Ventura and Santa Paula police departments wore the bands all 
week, as did 6,000 California Highway Patrol officers in observance of National 
Police Memorial Week. TRACY WILSON

<P>
 After losing $12.1 million in 1993, Ventura County National Bank moved this 
week to sell its home mortgage division and refocus its energy on the 
commercial banking business, bank officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The bank's mortgage wing was bought by CUB Funding Corp. of Calabasas for an 
undisclosed percentage of the division's future profits, said Peter Banks, 
chief financial officer at Ventura County National Bank.

 Banks said CUB will make the division more profitable than it was for VCNB, 
and the bank's own earnings from new mortgages will increase. 
</P>
<P>
 "CUB is more efficient at doing this than Ventura County National Bank," Banks 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 "If they do it better, that means they can do it at a lower cost, and there's 
more revenue potential." 
</P>
<P>
 Six of the mortgage division's 20 employees will be laid off, and the rest 
will continue to work in the same offices under its new name, Ventura County 
National Mortgage, Banks said. 
</P>
<P>
 CUB Funding Corp. is a division of the former California United Bancorp that 
was bought late last year by Republic Bancorp of Ann Arbor, Mich. Republic has 
more than $1 billion in assets and wrote $5 billion in mortgage loans last 
year, $1 billion of them in California, VCNB officials said. MACK REED

KIDS HAVE CHANCE TO LEAVE OWN ARTFUL IMPRESSIONS ON PARK WALKWAY; THOUSAND 
OAKS: CHILDREN INVITED TO DECORATE CERAMIC TILES FOR AREA OUTSIDE CIVIC ARTS 
PLAZA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Swashbuckling Mighty Morphin Power Rangers, X Men and other cartoon characters 
may soon lay claim to cultural immortality, seizing spots of honor in a 
seven-acre park outside Thousand Oaks' Civic Arts Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoping to get the city's youngest citizens excited about the cultural center, 
Thousand Oaks arts commissioners have invited children to decorate ceramic 
walkway tiles at a workshop today in Conejo Community Park at the corner of 
Dover and Hendrix avenues. 
</P>
<P>
 Up to 6,000 kid-painted tiles will then be set into a meandering path, 
providing a vibrant contrast to the blocky earth-tone building and its plush 
concert hall. 
</P>
<P>
 The cartoon figures expected to pop up on many of the tiles will no doubt look 
hopelessly dated in a few years' time. But Power Ranger and Ninja Turtle 
sketches will still be welcomed in the Civic Arts Plaza walkways, along with 
any other design youngsters can dream up. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers have suggested a few themes -- such as "If I could give the world a 
gift" -- but are also urging creativity. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a matter of trying to match" the tiles to the theater, Councilman 
Frank Schillo explained. "The main thing is to have children participate so the 
whole family can be part of the celebration." 
</P>
<P>
 Family involvement has become a mantra for volunteers planning the Civic Arts 
Plaza's grand opening weekend in late October. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Adults will have their moments, especially a black-tie concert featuring the 
Conejo Symphony Orchestra and Broadway singer Bernadette Peters. But organizers 
have also put together several child-oriented events, which the City Council 
will consider at Tuesday's meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members will vote, for example, on letting local children help build a 
giant sculpture made from recycled aluminum cans. 
</P>
<P>
 The sculpture -- a roaring lion dubbed "Recycle Leo" -- would be covered in 
wire mesh, so kids could hang crushed cans over its 23-foot-high frame. Sitting 
proudly in the Civic Arts Plaza park, the lion would reflect the site's former 
incarnation as the Jungleland wild animal park, arts commissioner Nancy Peloso 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Peloso will also ask the council to approve an art event for older children, 
an exhibit of high school students' sculptures and paintings in the Civic Arts 
Plaza's community gallery. 
</P>
<P>
 While the lion sculpture and high school art exhibit are proposed as temporary 
displays, the tiles will become a permanent part of the Civic Arts Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're like a time capsule," Arts Commissioner Bonnie Roth said. "Imagine 
how great it will be for the (artists) to take their grandchildren back to the 
Civic Arts Plaza years later to see their tiles." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Today's tile-decorating workshop will take place alongside the first Young 
People's Performing Arts Celebration. 
</P>
<P>
 From 10 a.m. to 4 p.m., Conejo Community Park will buzz with brief musical, 
dance and drama performances. More than 1,100 students, representing two dozen 
public and private schools, will strut their stuff on an outdoor stage, as food 
vendors peddle snacks and face painters work their magic. 
</P>
<P>
 Admission to the performance festival is free, but the ceramic tiles cost $5 
apiece. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is too big an event to miss," Roth said. "It'll be a real happening." 
And then, wistfully, she added: "I wish I were little."

EQUESTRIANS FIGHT TO SAVE LIFESTYLE, OPEN SPACE; THOUSAND OAKS: UNITED IN AN 
EFFORT TO PRESERVE LAND FOR SHOW RINGS AND TRAILS, THE HORSE COMMUNITY HAS 
BECOME A FORCE AGAINST DEVELOPMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Buffered only by a row of trees from the din of the Moorpark Freeway, Chrissy 
Rochford put her 5-year-old horse Randy through a workout at Waverly Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 To get there from her home, Chrissy and her horse crossed beneath the freeway 
twice, traversed several busy intersections and rode dangerously close to 
whizzing traffic on Janss Road. 
</P>
<P>
 But her brush with modern-day Thousand Oaks ended the moment she trotted into 
the publicly owned arena. 
</P>
<P>
 There, away from the cars and the rows of houses, 14-year-old Chrissy could 
prepare for a weekend show that would unite those who still see Thousand Oaks 
as a rural, horse-dominated town. 
</P>
<P>
 Joined in the fight to save space for show rings and horse trails, the 
Thousand Oaks equestrian community has become a tight-knit political force 
working to reverse a tide of development. 
</P>
<P>
 At the monthly horse shows, such as Sunday's show at Waverly Arena, Chrissy 
and about 100 other horse enthusiasts come together to celebrate their way of 
life. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our shows are a monthly reminder of what we've been working to maintain 
here," said Gina Smurthwaite, president of the local chapter of Equestrian 
Trails Inc., a national nonprofit open space preservation group. "We come here 
to keep all of our traditions alive." 
</P>
<P>
 While shows are held at a handful of arenas around Thousand Oaks, Waverly is 
the only public space devoted to the artistry of show riding. 
</P>
<P>
 Every month, volunteers from Corral 37 of Equestrian Trails organize the 
shows. Participants compete in 40 categories -- ranging from bareback riding to 
show jumping. 
</P>
<P>
 The competition is not fierce and is not part of any national circuit. It is 
friendly competition -- a way for riders of all experience levels to practice 
their skills and work out with their horses. 
</P>
<P>
 "Both young kids and adults come out to ride in the shows," said Kathy Shafer, 
the show chairwoman. "It's a competition, but it's also a chance to enjoy a day 
outside with the horses." 
</P>
<P>
 But, Shafer said, the rumble of the nearby freeway is a constant reminder that 
the future for the horse community in Thousand Oaks is uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a constant concern that at some point all of this land is going to 
be taken away," Shafer said. "We put on these shows so that there is always an 
outlet for people to use their horses, and to keep interest in maintaining the 
space to ride." 
</P>
<P>
 The fear of the equestrian community is not unfounded. Of the four major show 
rings in the area, three will probably be forced to clear out of the path of 
development in a few years. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Alexander, chairman of the Conejo Open Space Trails Advisory Committee, 
has been following the negotiations between the landowners and the arenas. 
</P>
<P>
 Equestrian facilities on the Seventh-day Adventist property, on the north 
campus of Cal Lutheran University and on the property of the proposed Dos 
Vientos development all could be forced to move in several years, Alexander 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our goal is to keep all of the facilities up and running, and if they need to 
be moved they should be moved to public land," Alexander said.  
</P>
<P>
 "On privately owned property, the equestrian land is left alone until the 
financial lure of development becomes too great," he explained. "The public 
land is much less liable to be developed." 
</P>
<P>
 At the request of the Thousand Oaks City Council, Alexander and other members 
of his open space advisory board drew up a series of recommendations for 
managing equestrian land in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 Included in those recommendations, now being reviewed by city planners, are 
proposals to create two new equestrian centers in publicly held open space. 
</P>
<P>
 Both would be larger than the 26-acre Waverly Arena, would house 200 horses, 
and would provide access to the 70 miles of trails that already accommodate 
horseback riders in the Conejo Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are obviously equestrian facilities that are going to be affected by 
major developments and we are working to come up with ways to provide 
alternative facilities," said Mark Towne, the city planner who handles open 
space issues. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the constant pressure and involvement from the equestrian community 
has pushed this into the position of being a priority for the city," Towne 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Several of the approximately 2,500 horse owners in Thousand Oaks said they 
became politically involved because of their devotion to the equestrian 
lifestyle. 
</P>
<P>
 Most live in tight-knit, horse-zoned neighborhoods around the city, where they 
are in almost constant contact with horses. They have stables in their yards, 
and most spend several hours a day caring for the horses. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our desire for open space comes from the fact that these horses are like 
members of the family," Shafer said.  
</P>
<P>
 "Some of them live to be 30 years old," she said. "They're like children that 
never move out of the house." 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Enge, 14, said his horse Hasty is one of his closest friends. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the summer when I don't have to worry about school I'm with her every 
day," he said. "She's a big part of my heart. If she was to die it would be 
like losing my brother or my dad." 
</P>
<P>
 Michael, who was at Waverly Arena last week practicing for Sunday's show, said 
he hopes to see the equestrian community left alone. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think learning to ride and compete with my horse has been a great way to 
grow up," he said. "I hope it's always this way." FYI 
</P>
<P>
 The ETI Corral 37 Horse Show will be held Sunday at Waverly Arena, near Janss 
Road and the Moorpark Freeway. Registration begins at 7:15 a.m., with English 
riding events beginning at 8 a.m. and Western events beginning at 12:30 p.m. 
The fee to compete is $5.

FUELING COMMERCE; GAS STATION PUMPS FEATURE SCREENS SHOWING COMMERCIALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK SABBATINI, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Do those minutes at the gas pump lack excitement? 
</P>
<P>
 Worry no more -- the fueling station of the future is here, said Joseph 
Nercesian, co-owner of the Bouquet Unocal station at the busy intersection of 
Bouquet Canyon and Soledad Canyon roads. Customers who fill their cars up at 
one of the station's 12 pumps can watch television commercials on newly 
installed screens. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a very revolutionary thing," Nercesian said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nercesian's station is one of three in the country with the "television 
pumps." Similar pumps have been installed at two non-Unocal stations in 
Houston. 
</P>
<P>
 The full-color screens, about 5 inches wide, were installed May 14 for test 
marketing at Nercesian's station as part of a computerized system allowing 
motorists to pay for gas with a credit card at the pump. The screen gives 
customers directions for using the machine until the gas pump is turned on and 
the commercials begin. 
</P>
<P>
 Advertising might not be the first choice of TV viewers at home, but most 
customers -- cash and credit -- at the station Friday morning were glued to the 
screens that were showing soft drink, snack and gas station commercials. Most 
said it was the first time they had seen the screens, and that the novelty was 
appealing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tripped out," said Mario Dos Santos, 19, a Saugus resident pumping gas into 
his pickup truck. "I thought it was pretty funny." 
</P>
<P>
 Not everyone appreciated the diversion. Edward Bethune, a Canyon Country 
resident, said the last thing people need to be exposed to is more advertising. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not going to watch it," he said. "I'm already inundated with commercials. 
I try to avoid them as much as I can. When I watch TV and they come on, I hit 
the mute button." 
</P>
<P>
 Bethune said he would be inclined to go to another gas station if the 
advertisements were louder, but the volume is kept low enough so he can ignore 
the programming. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the screen's liquid crystal display, similar to that of a 
notebook computer, is hard to see at an angle or in direct sunlight. Several 
customers said they didn't even realize the commercials were being played when 
they first started pumping fuel. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first time I was doing this I didn't even notice it," said Eric Lasko, a 
Los Angeles County sheriff's deputy at Peter J. Pitchess Honor Rancho in 
Castaic. "I thought it was someone's radio." 
</P>
<P>
 Machines that allow consumers to pay for gas at the pump using an ATM or 
credit card are nothing new. But Unocal Corp.'s marketing department developed 
the television screens as a "novel twist," allowing the company to promote 
services or products in a high-profile manner, said Barry Lane, a Unocal 
spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 "What else are you going to do while you're pumping gas?" he said. "It's kind 
of a diversion. I don't know about you, but for me the pump can never deliver 
the gas fast enough." 
</P>
<P>
 The Saugus station was selected for test marketing because it has a high 
volume of customers, Lane added. He said the screens will remain until the end 
of June, with customer response determining whether the concept will be 
expanded to other stations. 
</P>
<P>
 Although cash customers also see the "show," Nercesian said the number of 
customers making credit card purchases has increased 20% since the screens were 
installed. He said a major factor in the credit surge appears to be that people 
feel more comfortable not having to come into the station to make purchases, 
and leaving their children unattended outside. 
</P>
<P>
 The advertisements are stored on a CD-ROM disc, with five commercials stored 
on the prototype version and displayed at random. Nercesian said future discs 
would be dedicated primarily to promoting in-house services such as his 
carwash, but community service announcements and advertising bought by others 
could also be included. 
</P>
<P>
 Although most customers at Nercesian's station said they didn't mind 
advertising as the choice of programming, a few other suggestions were offered. 
Diane Pickett, a Canyon Country resident with a 3-year-old daughter, suggested 
music videos. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe you can get one in by the time you pump your gas," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sandy Greenberg, a Newhall resident with two young children, said she thinks 
the advertising is a good way to pass time at the pump, but doesn't want the 
programming to get too entertaining. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they showed cartoons, I wouldn't be able to pull my kids away," she 
laughed.

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: BURBANK; SOLUTION SOUGHT TO GARBAGE FEE ISSUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ED BOND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As garbage piles up in the Burbank landfill, city officials are left 
scrambling to find a solution to a dilemma that has placed them squarely 
between federal regulations and a potential 32% rate hike for garbage fees. 
</P>
<P>
 "The day of reckoning has arrived," Public Works Director Ora Lampman said 
this week when a $40-million construction plan to extend the life of the 
landfill to the mid-point of the next century was unveiled. 
</P>
<P>
 But paying for the project -- and meeting the federal regulations -- would 
mean that as of July, collection rates for residential garbage would have gone 
from $12.77 a month for a 64-gallon can to $16.86 a month. The rate for a 
35-gallon can would rise from $7 to $9.24, and fees for commercial customers 
would jump 25%, from $101.94 a month to $127.43. 
</P>
<P>
 But those rate hikes were rejected by the City Council after the proposal was 
presented during the panel's weekly meeting Tuesday, with Councilman Dave 
Golonski good-naturedly giving public works staff members the "thumbs down" 
sign. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think that in my whole time on the council, we've ever faced this 
kind of predicament," Councilman Bob Bowne said, later adding: "I'm just not 
going to accept a rate increase like this. There's just no way." 
</P>
<P>
 The new federal regulations went into effect in October, prohibiting landfill 
operators from using areas of the landfill that are on a slope unless they 
install a plastic liner with a leachate collection system. The Burbank 
landfill, which has no liner, had already been filled and the city has had to 
pile garbage on top of garbage since then, said Mary Glazer, public works 
administrator. 
</P>
<P>
 The city wants to find a solution before the start of the next rainy season. 
But the cost to construct improvements is expected to be $14 million to $15 
million within 3 1/2 years, and the regulations also require the city to set up 
a trust fund to pay for all improvements needed for the landfill throughout its 
lifetime, bringing the cost up to $40 million and requiring the rate hikes. 
</P>
<P>
 The council ordered city staff members to find an alternative, and Glazer said 
they have been in contact with state and other regulatory officials to get 
permission to use a nearby debris basin -- with a liner -- as a temporary 
landfill to take the pressure off Burbank. The city would then have a chance to 
find a more affordable way to pay for the construction. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to lessen the amount of the rate increase and spread it out over 
a period of a few years," Glazer said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the problem in Burbank is one that will probably be repeated elsewhere, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of cities and companies are all going to be in the same boat we are," 
Glazer said, referring to the new regulations. ED BOND

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SAN FERNANDO; FREE CHILDREN'S VACCINATION DRIVE BEGINS

 Roseann Brewer likes to bribe little children with pink happy-face stickers, 
not for their lunch money, but to ease the pain of the immunizations she 
injects as they cry and squiggle in their mothers' arms. 
</P>
<P>
 A pediatric nurse practitioner for the Los Angeles Unified School District, 
Brewer is one of many medical personnel and volunteers involved in free 
immunization clinics throughout Los Angeles.The project started Friday and 
continues through today. 
</P>
<P>
 About 2,000 children are expected to be vaccinated through the clinics, being 
held Friday at 11 schools -- all involved in the district's Los Angeles 
Education Alliance for Restructuring Now program -- and today at eight Catholic 
churches and one youth center. 
</P>
<P>
 The clinics are providing immunizations against measles, diphtheria, polio, 
rubella, mumps, tetanus, whooping cough and HIB, which causes meningitis in 
infants. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Unites States lags behind in having our children immunized," said Mardi 
Robes, a volunteer from the Los Angeles Rotary Club, one of the sponsors of the 
project. 
</P>
<P>
 "This gives the kids a chance to catch up or get them started with their first 
shots at no charge," said Robes, who attended the clinic at Morningside 
Elementary School in San Fernando. 
</P>
<P>
 Silvia Delgado of San Fernando, who brought her 4-year-old daughter, 
Christina, said she was pleased to be able to have her daughter immunized for 
free. "They're very expensive. I would have had to pay over $200." 
</P>
<P>
 "All children are required to be immunized to enter preschool," said 
Morningside Principal Vicki Montez. "The clinic will give them a head start" in 
the enrollment process for next fall.  
</P>
<P>
 Other sponsors of the vaccination effort include the LAUSD, the Los Angeles 
County Department of Health, the Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles and the 
Catholic Hospitals Assn. of Los Angeles. MAKI BECKER

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: BURBANK; STUDENTS MUST PROVE RESIDENCY 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 More than 2,200 students will be re-enrolled at four Burbank schools next week 
as the school district once again searches for Glendale residents who are 
illegally attending schools here. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a perception that we have students who are enrolled in our schools 
who may not be legally residing in Burbank," said Bob Fraser, director of 
elementary of education. 
</P>
<P>
 The Board of Education decided at its meeting Thursday night to notify parents 
to bring their children to their schools next week with a city of Burbank 
utility bill as proof of residency, as well as a photo identification card and 
the birth certificate or passport of the child. 
</P>
<P>
 Re-enrollment is mandatory for all students at Emerson and Jefferson 
elementary schools, as well as for all incoming ninth-grade and 10th-grade 
students at John Burroughs High School. Incoming kindergarten and first-grade 
students at Miller Elementary School whose files are incomplete also will be 
required to re-enroll. 
</P>
<P>
 The district re-enrolled all Miller students in the fall, ultimately finding 
only five students who were Glendale residents. However, 60 students who had 
shown up for classes at the beginning of the school year did not re-register, 
appearing to confirm for some that Glendale students have been attending 
Burbank schools, Fraser said. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents may re-enroll their children Tuesday from 4 to 8 p.m., Wednesday from 
7 a.m. to 8 p.m., and Thursday from 4 to 8 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who live in apartment complexes where they do not pay for municipal 
utilities, must bring the building's owner or manager along with the bill. 
</P>
<P>
 Information is available at the Burbank Outreach Center at (818) 558-5544, the 
Burbank Unified School District Instructional Services at (818) 558-5355 or 
from school principals. ED BOND

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: LAKE VIEW TERRACE; SCHOOL CELEBRATES NEW CHARTER STATUS

<TEXT>
<P>
 Fenton Avenue Charter School in Lake View Terrace celebrated its opening as a 
charter school Friday, a ceremony that was delayed four months because of 
earthquake damage to the school. 
</P>
<P>
 The charter program allows 10 schools in each district in California to 
receive funding directly from the state and determine what they will do with 
that money.Fenton Avenue is the second elementary school in the San Fernando 
Valley to become a charter school. 
</P>
<P>
 Irene Sumida, the director of instruction at Fenton Avenue, said that through 
the charter program the school has been able "to reduce the size of classes, 
have after-school programs until 4:30 p.m., enjoy a healthy surplus and restore 
the salaries of the teachers to what it was before the pay cut two years ago." 
</P>
<P>
 The opening, which was attended by Los Angeles Unified School District Supt. 
Sid Thompson and Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Panorama City), was celebrated in 
conjunction with the school's second annual International Festival. MAKI BECKER

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: NEW DIRECTOR NAMED FOR PARKS, RECREATION

<TEXT>
<P>
 A new parks and recreation director in San Fernando was named Thursday to 
replace Jess Margarito, the popular but controversial director fired in 
January. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm looking forward to it," said Ed Montan, assistant parks and recreation 
director for Manhattan Beach, after learning he had been named to the San 
Fernando post. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 40 people applied to replace Margarito as director. Montan was named 
after a closed session with the City Council on Wednesday night, said City 
Administrator Mary Strenn. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no beach in San Fernando," said Montan, talking about the differences 
between the two communities which are roughly the same size. But, even so, the 
beach is county-run and is not a part of the parks and recreation department in 
Manhattan Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't always worked in beach communities," said Montan, who has been in 
Manhattan Beach for six years. 
</P>
<P>
 The position, which pays from $57,000 to $70,000, involves planning and 
developing recreational and community programs in the largely Latino city. 
</P>
<P>
 Montan said he would be coming to San Fernando in a couple of weeks, after 
wrapping up a couple of projects in Manhattan Beach. ED BOND

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: JFK HIGH STUDENTS KNOW LITTLE OF JACKIE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF SCHNAUFER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 To the students at the only school in the Los Angeles Unified School District 
to bear the name of John F. Kennedy, the death of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis 
was another sad page in the history books. 
</P>
<P>
 Just don't ask them to write it. 
</P>
<P>
 At John F. Kennedy High School in Granada Hills, student reaction to the 
former First Lady's death on Thursday was long on inaccuracies and short on 
knowledge, although many expressed the Generation X version of sadness. 
</P>
<P>
 "It sucks," said Kathy May, 15, a 10th-grader from Granada Hills, who 
acknowledged, however: "I didn't know that much about her." 
</P>
<P>
 Most students said the school had taught them virtually nothing about 
President Kennedy's widow. Some didn't have to say much to prove it. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was her ex-husband, huh?" said James McMann, 15, a freshman from 
Chatsworth. 
</P>
<P>
 Others said what they learned had mostly come from television, and even that 
was confusing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I heard that they had read her her rights before she died," said 15-year-old 
Angie Neal of Granada Hills, confusing the police booking procedure with the 
last rites given by a priest. "Could you please explain that to me before you 
go?" 
</P>
<P>
 Only one student interviewed during the campus lunch hour Friday was able to 
express more than a few words about the former First Lady's character. 
</P>
<P>
 And that was because she could relate to her. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hear she was a great woman, a very strong woman," said Sharon Meyer, 16, a 
ninth-grader from North Hills. "We don't realize that until we lose someone 
close to us." 
</P>
<P>
 Meyer recently lost a cousin in an auto accident and a grandmother to natural 
causes. 
</P>
<P>
 But there was hope on campus that the generation could still learn to 
appreciate Mrs. Onassis: His name is Richard Sprouse, teacher of U. S. 
government. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was in high school at the time (of the Kennedy White House)," said Sprouse, 
49. "Jackie was so graceful. I loved when she introduced classical music into 
the White House. The Kennedy years were an inspiration to me. That's why I 
became a teacher." JEFF SCHNAUFER

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: RABBI CARRIES A BIG TORCH FOR KOSHER MEALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC SLATER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If there's one thing you don't expect to see on a quiet Friday in Malibu, it's 
a well-dressed rabbi with a 5-foot flamethrower. 
</P>
<P>
 But this was no ordinary Friday. It was two days before the biggest 
Western-style kosher wingding in the history of the world, quite possibly, and 
Rabbi Eliezer Eidlitz was at the Calamigos Ranch, propane torch in hand, to 
make sure all was kosher indeed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whatever they want torched, we'll torch," he said with a quiet chuckle. 
</P>
<P>
 The Emek Hebrew Academy of North Hollywood plans to "combine Orthodox Judaism 
. . . with California" in a barbecue and hoedown benefit to build a second 
school in Sherman Oaks, Eidlitz said. The group has cleaned Detroit, Chicago, 
New York and Los Angeles of beef ribs -- 1,000 pounds worth -- for the event. 
There will also be 900 pounds of chicken and several hundred hot dogs to enjoy. 
All of it is kosher, and every surface those items touch before touching the 
lips of the Jewish guests must be kosher, too. 
</P>
<P>
 Hence, the propane torch. 
</P>
<P>
 Torching is a common way to make stoves, pots, pans and other kitchen utensils 
kosher, Eidlitz said. The idea is to superheat the metal, burning away residue 
from non-kosher items that may have been cooked in them. 
</P>
<P>
 "Torching it opens up the pores of the metal," he said. "Anything that sank in 
will come out." 
</P>
<P>
 Yarmulke on his head, tie neatly tied even in the warm weather, the 
soft-spoken rabbi with the traditional long beard squeezed a trigger on the 
torch and the small, wriggling flame leaped out with a whoooosh. The heavy iron 
grill twisted and sagged in the 1,000-degree heat, and the remnants of 1,000 
wienies sizzled, popped and turned to smoke. 
</P>
<P>
 Eidlitz, a rabbi at the academy and the head of the its Kashrus Information 
Bureau, is one of the world's foremost authorities on kashrut , the law of 
Jewish dietary practice. He has compiled a computerized list of 100,000 kosher 
food items, puts out pamphlets on finding kosher food in non-kosher restaurants 
and has written a book called "Is It Kosher?" 
</P>
<P>
 In the modern world, he said, it can be difficult to adhere to the ancient 
traditions that were originally spelled out in the biblical books of Leviticus 
and Deuteronomy and expanded around the year AD 200 in a collection of 
rabbinical teachings called the Mishnah. 
</P>
<P>
 It's especially tough when you're cooking for 1,500 people who are used to 
attending Jewish fund-raisers in restaurant conference rooms, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only must Eidlitz torch every inch of the eight 10-foot-long barbecues, 
but "he has to kosher our cotton candy machine," said Susan Soja, sales 
director at the ranch, with a raise of her eyebrow. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll do it with water," Eidlitz reassured her, explaining that the 
contraption can be cleansed by washing and rinsing with scalding water. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers decided to cook the food at the academy's already-kosher kitchen -- 
a big relief for ranch chef Alfredo Saldivar. 
</P>
<P>
 Eidlitz will finish torching four of the giant grills today, then do another 
four Sunday morning before the hungry crowd arrives. 
</P>
<P>
 And if a gentle rabbi toting a flamethrower seems an odd sight, don't tell 
Eidlitz. He has a great time making things kosher. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's how I get my tan," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The kosher barbecue will be held at the Calamigos Ranch, 327 S. Latigo Canyon 
Road in Malibu, from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. Sunday. ERIC SLATER

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: RESEDA; STUDENTS HONORED FOR SURVIVING ROCKY YEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The awards ceremony was held during National Adult Education Week, but the 
real purpose of the event was to recognize older students who not only juggled 
jobs, marriages and families along with school this year, but also survived a 
massive earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been a very difficult year for many of our students," said Martin 
Conroy, principal of the Reseda Community Adult School. A ceremony was held 
Thursday night to honor all those who kept coming despite hardships caused by 
the Jan. 17 Northridge temblor. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really a recovery celebration," Conroy said. "They've lost housing, 
they've lost jobs, and they're still coming back." 
</P>
<P>
 Among those receiving special awards at the event was Ludmila Cantwell, a 
recent immigrant from the former Soviet state of the Ukraine, now called 
Ukrainia by many of its natives. Cantwell of Reseda won the student "Rookie of 
the Year" award for an essay she wrote her second day of class, a piece 
expressing awe at the diversity of American classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were men and women with black faces, brown faces and white faces," her 
essay reads, "immigrants or descendants of immigrants from all parts of the 
world. . . . Thank you America. Thank you for this opportunity to see people of 
so many nationalities in one classroom." 
</P>
<P>
 The teacher "Rookie of the Year" award went to Judy Finkelstein, an English as 
a Second Language instructor at the school. 
</P>
<P>
 "Her house was totally destroyed in the earthquake, (and) she hasn't let up 
one bit," Assistant Principal David Halabe said. "It's that kind of 
dedication." 
</P>
<P>
 Student Elizabeth Hernandez, who received the school's "Rookie of the Year" 
award in 1992, was presented a $500 scholarship from the Council of 
Mexican-American Administrators. And private Woodland Hills counselor Luz Bayer 
received a plaque for helping students through their many crises that followed 
the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 The 200 people at the event also heard big-band classics performed by the 
Reseda Community Adult School Stage Band, made up primarily of former 
professional musicians, many of whom now take part in the school's gerontology 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
 The school's mission is to "broaden education for adults," Conroy said and, to 
that end, enrolled 5,000 central Valley students this term. Classes are held at 
39 locations, and subjects range from English for non-native speakers to high 
school-equivalency courses. ERIC SLATER

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: GRANADA HILLS; SIMI FREEWAY WORK SHIFTS TO WEST LANES

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Westbound traffic on the Simi Valley Freeway in Granada Hills will shift to 
the eastbound lanes starting Sunday night or Monday night as construction 
begins on the westbound lanes, Caltrans said. 
</P>
<P>
 Traffic returned to the eastbound lanes Friday after Fontana-based Brutoco 
Engineering & Construction finished rebuilding that side of the bridges at San 
Fernando Mission Boulevard and Bull Creek. 
</P>
<P>
 The bridges had crumbled in the Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans spokesman Russell Snyder said San Diego-based contractor F.C.I. 
Constructors has 110 days to finish rebuilding the westbound bridges. During 
construction, the freeway will remain six lanes wide, three in each direction.  
</P>
<P>
 The project is expected to cost about $9.6 million. Rebuilding the east side 
of the bridges cost $9.7 million. HENRY CHU

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: L.A. SEEKS GRANT FOR BUSINESS QUAKE RELIEF 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles City Council voted Friday to apply for $1.8 million in federal 
earthquake recovery money that would include $350,000 for a San Fernando Valley 
consortium that hopes to create a recovery plan for Valley businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Department of Commerce and Economic Development Administration will 
be reviewing the grant application within the next month or so, city officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Valley consortium includes the Valley Industry Council, the United Valley 
Chambers of Commerce and the Valley Economic Development Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the grant application, the consortium would use the money to hire 
consultants who would help the business group assess the Valley's economy, 
define business problems created by the quake and suggest solutions. 
</P>
<P>
 The rest of the grant would be used to hire four "industry coordinators" for 
18 months to target industries citywide that were hard hit by the quake. 
Another six consultants would be hired to meet with business owners to identify 
gaps in the city's recovery plans. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, the grant would pay for a two-year project coordinator to oversee the 
entire city's business recovery efforts. HUGO MARTIN

CITY FILES CHARGES AGAINST GOLDTHWAIT OVER FIRE ANTIC; BURBANK: COMEDIAN FACES 
UP TO SIX MONTHS IN JAIL, $1,000 FINE FOR IGNITING HIS CHAIR DURING 'TONIGHT 
SHOW' TAPING. 
</P>

 The city attorney's office filed two misdemeanor charges Friday against 
comedian Bobcat Goldthwait, who unexpectedly set his chair on fire during a May 
6 taping of "The Tonight Show with Jay Leno." 
</P>
<P>
 The charges of unlawfully causing a fire and possession of a flammable 
substance or device with the intent to burn property are misdemeanors, 
punishable by six months in jail, a maximum fine of $1,000, or both. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're making a mountain out of a molehill," said Ron Stone, one of the 
comedian's managers. "It's one of the few times that the cliche fits. This 
blaze was put out by half a cup of water. The interpretation of this as a fire 
is sort of an exaggeration." 
</P>
<P>
 Public safety officials in Burbank disagreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you have someone in the public eye waving a red flag like this saying, 
'Look what I did,' and you let it go by, it gets worse and worse," said Fire 
Marshal Darryl Forbes. "What he did was extremely dangerous." 
</P>
<P>
 Fire officials initially sent the case to the district attorney's office in 
Glendale. But when it was determined that felony charges would not be filed, 
the Burbank city attorney's office took over. 
</P>
<P>
 Pat Schultz, a spokeswoman for NBC, said she could not recall another instance 
when a guest on "The Tonight Show" has been charged with a crime committed on 
the air. 
</P>
<P>
 An arraignment has been scheduled for June 23 at Burbank Municipal Court. 
</P>
<P>
 For such a stunt, Goldthwait would have needed a permit. But fire officials 
said no permit would have been issued because of the potential danger to Leno, 
actress Lauren Hutton and the studio audience.

2 QUAKE-DAMAGED FIRE STATIONS CAUSE DELAYS IN RESPONSE, OFFICIALS SAY; 
EMERGENCIES: FACILITIES IN NORTHRIDGE AND STUDIO CITY HAVE BEEN CLOSED SINCE 
JAN. 17. CREW'S ARRIVAL CAN NOW TAKE TWICE AS LONG. 
</P>

 The ragged cracks and sagging walls at Studio City's Fire Station 78 are 
nearly invisible from outside the yellow stucco building. Area residents might 
not even know firefighters were forced to abandon the quake-damaged station -- 
unless they have to call 911. 
</P>
<P>
 The 47-year-old firehouse was one of two closed by the Jan. 17 temblor -- the 
other was Fire Station 70 in Northridge -- and firefighters say their response 
times have risen because they are driving from stations located farther away. 
</P>
<P>
 Although there have been no problems so far, authorities say, some response 
times in Studio City's hard-to-negotiate hillside neighborhoods have doubled, 
and the issue is a continuing concern. One fire captain said it has been taking 
his crews an average of 10 minutes instead of five to arrive at the scene of an 
emergency. 
</P>
<P>
 "And that's the difference between life and death," said Capt. Thomas 
Jefferson, one of three commanders at Fire Station 108 on Mulholland Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 A 10-minute response time is the exception, however; most have increased by 
one or two minutes, from an average of four to six minutes, fire officials 
said. Until the quake-damaged stations reopen, four other firehouses including 
Jefferson's are covering their districts, with a computer routing calls to 
whoever is closest. 
</P>
<P>
 Though Fire Station 70 near the epicenter suffered the worst damage, including 
a garage door that jammed shut trapping firefighting apparatus inside, city 
officials expect the rebuilding of Fire Station 78 in Studio City to be a far 
greater task. 
</P>
<P>
 Built in 1947, the tiny firehouse was a prime candidate for replacement even 
before the temblor cracked its walls and separated its hose tower from the main 
building. Initially green-tagged, city inspectors re-evaluated the building 
last month and decided to close it because of more damage caused by 
aftershocks. 
</P>
<P>
 Located near the intersection of Ventura Boulevard and Coldwater Canyon 
Avenue, the station has been regarded as a community anchor and symbol of 
safety in a burgeoning city. But at 4,200 square feet, it is less than half the 
size of most of Los Angeles' modern firehouses. And it sits on a 
10,000-square-foot lot, while the preferred size is 25,000 square feet. 
</P>
<P>
 "Considering the size and age of the station, it wasn't cost-effective to 
rebuild it on that site," said Battalion Chief Robert J. MacMillan, who 
oversees the district. 
</P>
<P>
 Building a new fire station on a larger, yet-to-be-found site could take as 
long as three years, said Fire Department spokesman Roger Gillis. He added that 
the department hopes the estimated $2.5 million to $3 million cost will be 
covered by funds from the Federal Emergency Management Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Until then, protecting the five-square-mile district plagued by heavy traffic 
as well as narrow hillside streets will be a challenge. The densely populated 
area stretches from Hazeltine Avenue on the west to Laurel Canyon Boulevard on 
the east, Riverside Drive on the south and Potosi Avenue on the north. 
</P>
<P>
 "It only takes a minute or two longer" to reach emergencies, said Capt. Erick 
Lauridsen, who has been working out of Fire Station 86 on Vineland Avenue since 
Fire Station 78 closed. "But in the fire business that's an appreciable amount 
of time." 
</P>
<P>
 The district is also one of the Valley's busiest, with paramedics answering 10 
to 15 calls a day, according to MacMillan. So fire officials are considering 
razing the old fire station and installing temporary, modular structures at the 
site to have apparatus closer. That would take two to four months, and carry a 
$500,000 price tag, Gillis said. 
</P>
<P>
 There is also talk of reactivating a defunct electronic system that would 
allow emergency vehicles to change traffic lights to green along Ventura 
Boulevard, hastening their travel. At one time, the technology was used for 
city buses, but has since been deactivated, officials said.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 While the Studio City station remained open three months after the quake, the 
Northridge station suffered severe damage and was closed immediately. An 
interior brick wall crumbled and crews had to take one engine out a back door 
because the main door was too damaged to open. But repairs there will be 
relatively straightforward. Located near the intersection of Lassen Street and 
Reseda Boulevard, the 14-year-old structure is undergoing a $750,000 renovation 
and is expected to reopen in late July. 
</P>
<P>
 In the interim, the district's flat geography and relatively wide streets may 
make it easier to cover than the Studio City district, spokesman Gillis said. 
</P>
<P>
 Community leaders in both areas said they had not heard of problems caused by 
the closures. But Polly Ward, executive vice president of the Studio City 
Homeowners Assn., said some residents were slightly uneasy about not having a 
local fire station for the first time in nearly five decades. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we had a great sense of security because it was here, right in the 
midst of a big community," Ward said.

2 WEST VALLEY SYNAGOGUES APPROVE MERGER PLAN; CONGREGATIONS: BETH KODESH OF 
WEST HILLS AND TEMPLE BETH AMI OF RESEDA WILL BRING TOGETHER 850 MEMBER 
FAMILIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Two West Valley synagogues -- one with building plans and the other facing 
declining membership -- have voted to merge and form a new, 850-family 
congregation. 
</P>
<P>
 Congregation Beth Kodesh of West Hills favored the merger plan 254 to 124 and 
Temple Beth Ami of Reseda approved the proposal 145 to 50 in separate votes 
taken Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think (the merger) will help us to increase our outreach to unaffiliated 
Jews and give us an opportunity to come up with new educational programs," said 
Rabbi Eli Schochet, who will lead the services and deliver the sermons for the 
merged congregation. 
</P>
<P>
 Schochet, 59, came to Congregation Beth Kodesh in 1960 shortly after he was 
ordained. 
</P>
<P>
 Both synagogues are affiliated with the Conservative branch of Judaism. A name 
for the new congregation will be chosen before the merger becomes effective 
July 1, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Beth Kodesh, which has 525 individuals and couples as members, has been 
proceeding with building plans for land it owns on Valley Circle Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 "With the decision to merge, the building project becomes even more viable," 
said Judy Krigsman, the current executive director for Beth Kodesh who will 
become the administrator for the new congregation. 
</P>
<P>
 Temple Beth Ami's rabbi, David Vorspan, 47, said he will assume duties as 
executive director although he will lead contemporary worship services and 
assist at the pulpit during the High Holy Days. 
</P>
<P>
 Beth Ami had merged with Temple Ner Maarev of Encino about three years ago, 
but the consolidation fell apart nine months later. "There were important 
differences in style that could not be overcome," Vorspan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Vorspan did not foresee problems with this merger. "We are as traditional as 
Beth Kodesh has been except for the use of a guitar during our twice-monthly 
Saturday services," the rabbi said. "The leadership of Beth Kodesh understands 
the need for alternative ways to pray." 
</P>
<P>
 Beth Ami has recently faced "a gradually declining membership and Hebrew 
school enrollment," said Clara Rosenbluth, the congregation's president. 
</P>
<P>
 "In looking ahead, we didn't see a promising future for growth given the 
changing demographics in Reseda," Rosenbluth said. 
</P>
<P>
 "With today's economy and salaries, it is very difficult for a small 
congregation to provide all the services and programs we want," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosenbluth said there are no plans to sell Temple Beth Ami. The merged 
congregation will hold Sabbath worship at Beth Kodesh's facility at 7401 Shoup 
Ave. starting in July, but Beth Ami's larger sanctuary will be used for holiday 
services and its buildings may be needed for other functions, she said.

FORMER OPERATOR OF PIERCE SWAP MEET CHARGES DISCRIMINATION; REVENUES: COLLEGE'S 
FOUNDATION SAYS IT DISMISSED THE FIRM BECAUSE OF FINANCIAL QUESTIONS. THE 
COMPANY'S HEAD ALLEGES IT WAS AN EFFORT TO RID THE EVENT OF LATINO INFLUENCE. 
</P>

<P>
 The popular weekend swap meet at Pierce College will be canceled for at least 
the first week in June because the former operator of the event, dismissed 
ostensibly because of financial questions, has charged that the real motive is 
racial discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
 The college's foundation had voted not to renew the swap meet agreement with 
Norton Western Ltd., a firm run by a controversial former Santa Ana city 
councilman, Richards Norton, and instead hired Straight Talk Inc., a nonprofit 
Orange County social services agency to take over effective June 1. 
</P>
<P>
 However, a snag emerged Wednesday when Norton raised the discrimination 
allegations at a meeting of the Los Angeles Community College District's board 
of trustees. 
</P>
<P>
 Norton said his ouster is part of an effort by the college's foundation to rid 
the swap meet of its predominantly Latino influence and vendors. "They 
basically don't like the color of our clientele," Norton said of the 
foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 Foundation officials denied that charge, but trustees, who were hearing 
Norton's charges for the first time, responded with an action that effectively 
halted the transition at least until their June 8 meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 At that meeting, the trustees will determine whether Straight Talk can take 
over the operation. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Lee, Pierce's interim president, said Friday the north parking lot at 
Victory Boulevard and Mason Avenue, where the swap meet is held Saturdays and 
Sundays, will be empty June 4 and 5. 
</P>
<P>
 The foundation's decision to oust Norton Western appears rooted in doubts 
about the company's financial integrity. Norton denied any wrongdoing, but 
acknowledged officials at the college had questioned him in recent months about 
financial matters. The college's foundation is supposed to get about a quarter 
of the event's proceeds, with Norton getting the rest. 
</P>
<P>
 James Breeden, the chairman of Pierce's foundation, declined to specify why 
Norton Western was dismissed. But he said of Norton Western: "Business 
practices were questioned and improvements were not forthcoming. The manner in 
which the swap meet was conducted did not give the foundation a sense of 
comfort." 
</P>
<P>
 Norton conceded that he was late last year in making required payments to the 
foundation during a period of financial setbacks, but said he got permission to 
extend the payments and "made up every single dime." He also acknowledged 
questions being raised about the number of paying vendors he was reporting to 
the foundation versus the actual numbers operating. 
</P>
<P>
 Similar questions dogged Norton's operation of a swap meet at Rancho Santiago 
College in Santa Ana between 1988 and 1991. After a former swap meet employee 
there contended that Norton Western was not reporting all of its swap meet 
income to the college, two members of that college's board of trustees called 
for a district attorney's investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles W. (Pete) Maddox, current chairman of the Rancho Santiago College 
board, said he is convinced Norton's company and a related organization 
shortchanged the college during that period. But Maddox said he and others were 
never able to prove their suspicions because Norton Western's records 
supposedly were stolen in a robbery. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a damn lie," Norton said of Maddox's allegations over the money. 
"There's never been an investigation. There's never been a lawsuit charging not 
all the money was paid." 
</P>
<P>
 Norton -- who served on the Santa Ana City Council from 1989 until he resigned 
last October, citing health reasons -- blamed the allegations on 
misunderstandings. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pierce swap meet is supposed to be one of the foundation's main 
fund-raising tools for the college. However, Lee said about $95,000 of the 
foundation's $112,000 share of swap meet revenues in a recent year went to pay 
the salaries and benefits of the foundation's two paid employees, with the 
college getting only the small remainder.

JEWEL THEFT CONVICTION DISMISSED ON TECHNICALITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Ruling that charges were not officially filed until after the statute of 
limitations expired, a judge threw out the conviction Friday of a jewelry 
dealer who was found guilty of stealing a 6.76-carat Burmese ruby. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Nuys Superior Court Judge Kathryne Ann Stoltz granted a motion to dismiss 
the grand theft conviction of Ali Reza Paravar, who had faced a possible prison 
term of up to five years. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though Stoltz said Paravar was "clearly guilty" of the offense, she said 
the California Penal Code left no choice but to grant the motion. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been through hell," Paravar said as he left the courtroom. Paravar, a 
42-year-old Woodland Hills man, and his attorney, Jerry Kaplan, declined 
further comment. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the ruling is unfortunate because it results in a situation where 
justice was not done in this case," said Deputy Dist. Atty. Eduards Abele . 
</P>
<P>
 A jury convicted Paravar last month of stealing the stone -- valued at between 
$500,000 and $1 million -- from German gem trader Peter Morlock. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors convinced a jury that the theft occurred after Morlock gave the 
ruby on consignment to Ron Levi, another downtown jewelry dealer. Levi then 
gave the stone to Paravar. When Morlock asked that the pinky fingertip-sized 
ruby be returned, Paravar refused, saying that Levy owed him $400,000, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Morlock then took the matter to the Los Angeles police, who told him the 
matter appeared to be a business dispute and not a criminal matter. 
</P>
<P>
 Paravar kept the stone for most of the next three years, according to his own 
testimony. 
</P>
<P>
 He was arrested with four other men last summer. The stone, known as the "Mona 
Lisa of rubies," was found in Paravar's pocket. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities alleged Paravar and the other men were involved in a scheme to 
extort $360,000 from Morlock in exchange for the ruby. 
</P>
<P>
 When the matter finally came to trial, the case against one defendant had 
already been dismissed. During the trial, Stoltz threw out charges against a 
second defendant, saying there was not enough evidence to support a conviction. 
</P>
<P>
 The six-man, six-woman jury that convicted Paravar acquitted another man on 
charges of receiving stolen property. 
</P>
<P>
 A mistrial was declared in the case of the remaining defendant, 46-year-old 
Rasekh Uddin Siddiqui, when the panel split 8 to 4 in favor of guilt on charges 
of receiving stolen property. Prosecutors have announced they will retry 
Siddiqui, who left Southern California after his arrest and is currently living 
in Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
 In Paravar's case, the question before the judge involved when the prosecution 
began. 
</P>
<P>
 Paravar successfully argued that the three-year statute of limitations ended 
Sept. 24, 1993 -- more than two months before Paravar was charged in Superior 
Court. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors said they would review the ruling to determine if the judge's 
ruling should be appealed.

LEGAL FOUNDATION HONORS FIREFIGHTERS

<P>
 Four Los Angeles firefighters who were trapped in Box Canyon during last 
year's wildfires were honored at a luncheon ceremony Friday for their courage. 
</P>
<P>
 About 400 people attended the 13th annual Law Enforcement Awards at the Airtel 
Plaza Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 The firefighters were from Engine Company 98 in Pacoima, the only group of 
honorees to receive a standing ovation for exceptional public service. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were running into the fires to save our homes and our livelihood," said 
Lee Kanon Alpert, president of the Valley Community Legal Foundation, which 
sponsored the lunch. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's time for the community to say thank you," Alpert said in a telephone 
interview Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 All four men, Capt. Jan Bernard, Firefighter Russell Nakamura, Engineer 
Cleveland Tipton and Firefighter Gary Carpenter, were burned last October when 
they responded to a brush fire in the Chatsworth area. 
</P>
<P>
 At the scene, the wind direction shifted suddenly and a wall of fire engulfed 
their truck and trapped the four firefighters. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the first year the foundation included firefighters among its law 
enforcement honorees. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will continue to include firefighters in the future," Alpert said. "They 
are as much law enforcement officers even though they don't carry guns or 
arrest people." 
</P>
<P>
 Others honored by the nonprofit organization were members of city and county 
law enforcement agencies for helping make neighborhoods safer. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those honored: Sgt. Richard Barton, a 21-year veteran of the California 
Highway Patrol; Sgt. Ronald E. Boudreaux, who has served in the Los Angeles 
County Sheriff's Department for 23 years; Officer Chris Draper of the San 
Fernando Police Department, and Detective Craig Rhudy of the Los Angeles Police 
Department's Van Nuys Division, who has been with the agency for 21 years. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, several students from San Fernando Valley schools were recognized 
for their essays. The winning essays responding to this year's topic, "Just 
Solutions," were written by fifth-grader Nakia Jackson of Woodlake Avenue 
Elementary School; Jessica Gottlieb, a sixth-grader from Welby Way Elementary 
School, and Daniel Treiman, an 11th-grader from John F. Kennedy High School. 
</P>
<P>
 The Valley Community Legal Foundation was founded in 1972 with the goal of 
enhancing respect for the law.

ARMENIANS CONFRONTED AT ANTI-BIAS EVENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Leaders of the Armenian American community joined Friday to denounce prejudice 
but felt it firsthand soon after the news conference concluded. 
</P>
<P>
 An unidentified woman approached one of a dozen leaders present and chastised 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 "Do you have to speak out?" she asked Raffi Hamparian, governmental affairs 
director for the Armenian National Committee's Glendale chapter. 
</P>
<P>
 "You think you own Glendale," she said, in reference to Armenian Americans. 
"You try to get away with everything you can. We're fed up with you too." 
</P>
<P>
 The woman declined to give her name and left without elaborating on her 
comments. 
</P>
<P>
 For Hamparian, it was just another example of "the recent wave of 
anti-Armenian sentiments and actions in the city of Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were having a press conference about intolerance and here was such a bold 
manifestation of an individual who is so filled with hate," he said. "More than 
being angry, I was saddened by it." 
</P>
<P>
 The event, held in front of St. Mary's Armenian Apostolic Church on Central 
Avenue, was prompted by recent vandalism at a building for Armenian American 
Boy and Girl Scouts. 
</P>
<P>
 A spray-painted swastika and pentagram were found Saturday on a wall of the 
Homenetmen Armenian General Athletics Union and Scouts building at 544 W. 
Broadway. Vandals also defaced two vans parked nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 Police have classified the incident as a hate crime. 
</P>
<P>
 A $500 reward for information leading to the vandals is being offered by the 
Armenian American Action Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Community leaders from such groups as the Armenian Society of Los Angeles and 
the Armenian Youth Federation called for Glendale officials to publicly condemn 
the incident and asked for the creation of a high-profile human relations 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fabric of Glendale . . . is being threatened and torn apart by the 
ignorance and bigotry of a minority of citizens," Hamparian said during the 
news conference. 
</P>
<P>
 "And so we have gathered here today to positively declare that the Armenian 
American community has and will continue to play a positive role in the city of 
Glendale."

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; FIELD BURN MEANT TO AID POPPIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The goal is that from the ashes, poppies will spring. 
</P>
<P>
 State park officials on Tuesday will burn nearly 15 acres within the 
California Poppy Reserve in hopes of ridding the land of non-native plants and 
seeds to give poppies a better chance to flourish. 
</P>
<P>
 With little rain this past winter, the recent poppy season was less than 
spectacular, said John Crossman, resource ecologist for the state Department of 
Parks and Recreation. In addition, non-native grasses and weeds overshadowed 
the poppy plants, which in a good year bloom prolifically enough to create a 
seemingly endless blanket of orange flowers. 
</P>
<P>
 "California poppies do well in areas that have a little bit of disturbance," 
he said, noting that the state flower often springs up in grazed areas. "We're 
not ready to plow the fields or let the sheep in, but (with the prescribed 
burn) we hope to improve our display of wildflowers." 
</P>
<P>
 A 6 1/2-acre area at the state reserve entrance and an 8 1/4-acre area west of 
the visitors' center are scheduled to be burned Tuesday, he said, noting that 
the total area to be burned amounts to less than 1% of the 1,700-acre reserve.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; SCHOOL DISTRICT WILL IMPOSE BUSING FEE; 
TRANSPORTATION: THE CASTAIC BOARD APPROVES A $150 ANNUAL CHARGE. PARENTS HAVE 
SEVERAL PAYMENT OPTIONS. 
</P>

<P>
 If you plan to ride the school bus here, make sure you've brought your Visa 
card. Because in this north county community, school officials don't like to 
see children walking through truck traffic, and they don't take American 
Express. 
</P>
<P>
 Castaic Union School District trustees voted 4 to 1 Thursday night for a 
$150-annual busing fee with payment options that include installment plans, 
day-pass ticket books and most major credit cards. 
</P>
<P>
 Trustee Dirk Gosda dissented, instead supporting a $200 fee that he said will 
eventually have to be assessed. 
</P>
<P>
 About 1,400 of the district's 1,670 students are bused to Castaic and Live Oak 
elementary schools and Castaic Middle School in an expensive transportation 
program that cost $314,000 this year. 
</P>
<P>
 California reimburses schools for bus service using a 1978 formula based on 
the number of student riders. Minor adjustments are made for inflation but not 
explosive population growth such as that the Santa Clarita Valley has 
experienced. 
</P>
<P>
 The fee structure adopted Thursday requires families to pay $150 for a child 
to be bused to and from school or $300 for more than one child. Ticket books, 
at $1 per ride, will be available for infrequent riders, and parents can pay in 
quarterly installments or with major charge cards -- except American Express. 
</P>
<P>
 A high percentage of Castaic students take the bus because they live across 
the Golden State Freeway and would have to navigate busy truck traffic and 
off-ramp traffic to reach campus. 
</P>
<P>
 Assuming only half those now bused pay the new fee this fall, it will offset 
$100,000 of the annual transportation debt, according to Michael R. Slater, 
district business manager. 
</P>
<P>
 Trustees on Thursday also approved an earlier start for Castaic Middle School, 
beginning the day at 7:30 a.m. rather than 8. That move is expected to save the 
district $25,000 by allowing more buses to be removed from service. 
</P>
<P>
 "What that does is allow us to get the middle school kids out and come back 
for kids grades three through five (using the same buses)," Slater said. 
</P>
<P>
 Castaic becomes the fourth Santa Clarita Valley school system to implement a 
busing fee. 
</P>
<P>
 The William S. Hart Union High School District and the Newhall School District 
charge students $200 a year to ride the bus, and last fall the Sulphur Springs 
School District approved a fee of $60 per semester or $100 per year. 
</P>
<P>
 State law exempts disabled students from such fees.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; EARTHY LESSONS FROM THE 'MOON'; EDUCATION: AS 
TROLLS AND MYSTICAL WINDS, REPERTORY THEATRE TROUPE TEACHES SANTA CLARITA 
STUDENTS THAT PATIENCE AND HARD WORK PAY OFF. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 About 9,000 youngsters here have learned the importance of hard work and 
self-esteem from trolls, mystical winds, a Spanish-speaking bear and a 
candle-maker's daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 The lesson came from the Santa Clarita Repertory Theatre's bilingual 
presentation of "East of the Sun, West of the Moon." Friday's presentation 
ended a string of 33 performances in 28 Santa Clarita Valley elementary schools 
over the past few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Patience, hard work and believing in yourself will make your dreams come 
true," Candace Juman told Santa Clarita Elementary School students Friday, 
summing up what her character, Karen, learned from the story. 
</P>
<P>
 The 45-minute show focused on Karen meeting Eric the Kind, a prince cursed to 
live as a bear during the day, and her attempts to rescue him from a 
magic-invoking troll. 
</P>
<P>
 The quick pace kept young viewers' attention, introducing boisterous 
characters and letting students take part by growling for the bear and helping 
blow along with the mystical winds. 
</P>
<P>
 "It grows a lot, because of the energy they give you," said Ronnie Clark, 24, 
who portrays Eric the Kind and his alter ego, the bear. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Clark's character spoke in Spanish in a play that otherwise unfolds 
entirely in English, the responses were clear enough so the audience understood 
his intentions. 
</P>
<P>
 With Juman playing the central character, actors Clark, Chris Anthony and Milo 
Bernstein brought the tale's other creatures to life. 
</P>
<P>
 Cast members said the presentation took about a week of diligent rehearsing to 
develop and that they've learned along the way what does and doesn't work. They 
say elementary school students often are a tougher audience than adults. 
</P>
<P>
 "They don't take any crap," said Anthony, 25, who played the tale's main 
villain, a powerful but comical troll. "The adults can be reserved, but with 
them -- if it's bad, you'll know it." 
</P>
<P>
 One short section of the play allowed for some ad-libbing with the audience, 
making each performance slightly different. 
</P>
<P>
 Anthony and Clark are students at CalArts, majoring in theater; Bernstein and 
Juman are alumni of the Valencia school. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really nice to have the Repertory Theatre," said Juman, 22. "It's really 
nice to have work for CalArts students." 
</P>
<P>
 Funding for Santa Clarita Repertory Theatre programs is provided in part by 
grants from the city and the Henry Mayo Newhall Foundation.

RELIGION / JOHN DART; MASS CRUSADE COMING TO VALLEY, BUT FORMAT DISAPPOINTS 
LATINOS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN DART 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As the first mass evangelism crusade ever held in the San Fernando Valley 
approaches, some local Latino Christian leaders are disappointed that 
organizers are downplaying the potential appeal of evangelist Luis Palau to the 
area's large Spanish-speaking population. 
</P>
<P>
 Palau will preach in a Spanish-language service at Van Nuys' 3,500-seat Church 
on the Way next Saturday night. But that is four days before the widely 
promoted crusade itself, which will run June 1 through 5 at Birmingham High 
School's football stadium in Van Nuys, where up to 15,000 people may sit in the 
stands and on the field. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were hoping for (another) five days in Spanish, but it didn't work out," 
said Robert Lozano, executive secretary of the crusade's Hispanic Organizing 
Committee. "We were disappointed, to be honest, but we appreciate what we 
have." 
</P>
<P>
 The Argentine-born Palau, a U.S. citizen for three decades and a popular 
evangelist overseas, also had hoped to do more preaching aimed at the third of 
the Valley's population with a Latino heritage. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a familiar quandary for Palau. The evangelist is a scandal-free, 
congenial and articulate Christian seen by many U.S. evangelical leaders as a 
natural successor to Billy Graham. But because of his Spanish surname, Palau's 
aides and the coalitions of largely Anglo evangelical churches that ask him to 
lead crusades in their cities want to make it clear that he is preaching in 
English. 
</P>
<P>
 Roughly the same format -- in which one small Spanish-language rally is held 
separately -- was followed over the last two years by Palau crusades in 
Phoenix, San Antonio and Fort Worth, Tex., cities that also have high Latino 
populations. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are always trying to keep the Spanish part low-key and publicizing it on 
the Spanish media," said Palau, 59, interviewed this week by telephone from his 
home in Portland, Ore. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had hoped we could find a way out of this dilemma with a more effective 
communication to the many people who prefer Spanish as their first language," 
Palau said. 
</P>
<P>
 During the five-night Valley crusade, simultaneous translations in Spanish (as 
well as Korean, Japanese and other languages) will be available for people who 
remember to bring radios and earphones. "That should be just as effective," 
Palau said. 
</P>
<P>
 Evangelist Raimundo Jiminez of Granada Hills, a member of the local crusade's 
large executive committee, was less optimistic. "Very few people want to be at 
the crusade with something stuck in their ears," Jiminez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, Lozano, Jiminez and Palau himself said in interviews that they have 
accepted the reasons for the format given by the local organizers and Colin 
James, the crusade director for the Luis Palau Evangelistic Assn., based in 
Portland. 
</P>
<P>
 James said that if even one Spanish-language rally were to be held at the same 
venue -- either just before or just after the English-language nights, as 
Jiminez and some others suggested -- there would be confusion in the public 
whether the other nights were partly or wholly in Spanish as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, large posters, lawn signs and bumper stickers promoting the June 1-5 
crusade are all printed in English. As of this week, only small flyers in 
Spanish were available, and they described only next Saturday's 
Spanish-language rally. 
</P>
<P>
 James said that if Anglos saw identical posters in Spanish about next month's 
crusade, they might conclude that everything was in Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to keep everything utterly, clearly simple so everyone can figure out 
what we are trying to do," James said. 
</P>
<P>
 Another consideration, James added, was that "we found many Hispanics do not 
want to be segmented." 
</P>
<P>
 A larger outreach to Spanish-speaking Christians in the Valley might have 
materialized except that "the first meetings with the Hispanic committee last 
summer was slow and response was not strong," James said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Quite frankly, the Hispanic organization lagged behind the Anglos'," he said. 
"If we don't get organized by a certain time, we can't support it financially." 
</P>
<P>
 Plans for the crusade were announced last July with the impetus and leading 
personnel coming largely from the 8,000-member Church on the Way. Crusade 
Executive Director Lawrence Hoke, a Litton Industries vice president for 
finance, announced a crusade budget of more than $300,000. Entertainer Pat 
Boone and Galpin Ford's Bert Boeckmann were named honorary co-chairmen of the 
crusade. Hoke, Boone and Boeckmann are members of Church on the Way. 
</P>
<P>
 At that time, 130 churches and church-related organizations, primarily in the 
Valley, had promised to support the five-day crusade with volunteers and 
donations. That list has grown to more than 200 today. Participating 
congregations will be asked to collect offerings for the crusade at their 
services Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Palau said that his organization hopes to work out schedules that will 
accommodate Spanish-speaking residents at future crusades in Miami and Chicago. 
"We are working on the idea that next year in Miami we will have three days in 
English followed by five days in Spanish," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Valley, Latino Christian organizers are hoping that they might bring 
back Palau sometime for an all-Spanish crusade in the Los Angeles area. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're dreaming of a five- to seven-day event with two days here, two days in 
Orange County, two in Ventura County, then a big rally in Los Angeles," said 
Lozano, who heads the crusade's Hispanic committee and owns a Spanish-language 
Christian bookstore in Arleta. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Lozano predicted that there would be "a full house" next Saturday 
for the Spanish-language rally and music festival, which starts at 6 p.m. at 
Church on the Way. The sanctuary seats about 3,500, and another 1,000 could 
watch the rally on closed-circuit television. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Jiminez said he would be promoting both the rally and the five-day crusade on 
his Spanish-language talk show, produced by World Television in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 Latinos in Southern California are mostly Roman Catholic. But a 1991 Los 
Angeles Times Poll in the San Fernando Valley showed that of the Latino adults 
who grew up as Catholics and live in the Valley, only 60% said they were still 
Catholic. The rest said they identified with another religious body or no faith 
at all. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do not allow attacks on the Catholic Church," Jiminez said. "We just 
present the positive Gospel of Jesus Christ." 
</P>
<P>
 Palau echoed Jiminez's approach. "Through 30 years of preaching, I have never, 
never attacked the Catholic Church, because I am convinced that changes come in 
people's behavior and spiritual habits when you come to Christ and read the 
Bible for yourself. 
</P>
<P>
 "I try not to be divisive," Palau said. "I seldom have received attacks from 
people of other convictions, nor have I been accused (by evangelical 
Christians) of compromising the Gospel."

RELIGIOUS FAITH FINDS NEW RESPECTABILITY ON PRIME-TIME TV; MEDIA: STUDIES FIND 
MORE POSITIVE DEPICTIONS OF SPIRITUALITY, BUT ADD THAT RELIGION IS STILL 
LARGELY IGNORED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The main characters explore questions of faith as if their beliefs mean 
something. 
</P>
<P>
 A minister talks to his flock about sin and forgiveness. A schoolteacher asks 
God's help in reaching a student. A Quaker character berates herself for using 
the threat of violence to prevent bloodshed. 
</P>
<P>
 The shocking thing is this blatant display of religion is all taking place on 
prime-time television. 
</P>
<P>
 These scenes from the new CBS show "Christy" are only the most recent example 
of faith's newfound respectability on the small screen. Other recent shows such 
as "Thea" on ABC, "Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman" on CBS and "Against the Grain" on 
NBC have treated faith respectfully. 
</P>
<P>
 "Prime time is on the right track; it should stay on it," said the authors of 
a study done by the conservative Alexandria, Va.-based Media Research Center. 
</P>
<P>
 However, defenders of secular lifestyles should fear not. The shows do not 
signify a mass conversion of television producers to the recognition that faith 
is important to the vast majority of their audiences, according to the Media 
Research Center report and another new study that indicates religion is largely 
ignored or belittled in prime time. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In a study published in the recent issue of the Review of Religious Research, 
researchers from the University of Dayton, Northwestern University Medical 
Center and Duke University Medical Center examined a random sample of 100 
episodes of network television in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Out of 1,462 characters, only 82, or 5.6%, had an identifiable religious 
affiliation. Further, five of the 82 characters were religious cult members, 
while no characters were portrayed as members of the Jewish faith. 
</P>
<P>
 If few characters have an identifiable religious affiliation, even fewer 
engage in prayer, attend church or participate in group religious activities, 
the study found. 
</P>
<P>
 "The data clearly indicate that the exploration of religion and spirituality 
in the lives of fictional characters is nearly invisible on network 
television," the researchers concluded. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Media Research Center study, researchers found only 116 treatments of 
religion in more than 1,000 hours of prime-time programming in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those who assert that sitcoms, dramatic series, telefilms and miniseries 
engage in relentless religion-bashing are wrong. . . . It is clear that 
Hollywood ignores religion far more than it demeans it," said the study, "Faith 
in a Box: Prime Time on Religion." 
</P>
<P>
 When religion is mentioned on prime time, it is often in a demeaning way, such 
as when characters in NBC's "Cafe Americain" joked about making love in a 
confessional or when a character playing a Protestant minister on "Picket 
Fences" on CBS said the Vatican opposes contraception because a population 
explosion would help it achieve world domination, the study found. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a cultural disconnect between mainstream America and the cultural 
creed of the Hollywood community," said Thomas Johnson, co-author of the study. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the situation seems to be getting better, the report found. 
</P>
<P>
 In dividing up the portrayals of religion on the four networks, the center 
found more negative than positive portrayals, but taken together the positive 
and mixed portrayals represented a majority of the depictions. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For example, the study said, a made-for-television movie on the Fox network 
about former New York Jet Dennis Byrd did not gloss over how his religious 
faith helped him recover from a paralyzing injury. 
</P>
<P>
 And the theme song in "Thea" goes in part, "With God on my side, keeping me in 
line, I don't worry about nothing, it's gonna be fine." 
</P>
<P>
 In the media center's recommendations for improvement, the first suggestion by 
Johnson and Sandra Crawford was for the networks to continue the present trend 
of treating religion respectfully in shows such as "Christy." 
</P>
<P>
 William Fore, author of "Television and Religion," said network leaders 
deserve praise for presenting a show such as "Christy." 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's a good thing that the networks did it, and they have the right 
to be commended for doing it," said Fore, a lecturer at Yale Divinity School. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But he thinks the small increase in shows presenting religion as part of life 
has more to do with heading off the outrage of viewers and potential government 
regulators than more idealistic motives of fairly representing religion in 
society. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are trying to deal with the public's increasing awareness and upset with 
the violence . . . and also the elements of hedonism that are there," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those are perfectly cynical reasons why they do this."

L.A. PRODUCE SUPPLIER MOVING TO LOS ALAMITOS; FOODSTUFFS: FRIEDA'S INC., WHICH 
POPULARIZED THE KIWI FRUIT, PACKING UP HEADQUARTERS AND 115 EMPLOYEES TO 
CORPORATE CENTER SITE.

<P>
 Frieda's Inc., a specialty produce supplier best known for popularizing kiwi 
fruit in the United States, is moving its headquarters and 115 employees here 
from Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The company, the seventh-largest women-owned business in Los Angeles, has 
leased an 81,000-square-foot office and warehouse in Los Alamitos Corporate 
Center on Cerritos Avenue near Lexington Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 The move, to be completed by July 1, ends a three-year search for a new and 
larger base of operations. Nearly all of the employees are expected to make the 
20-mile relocation. 
</P>
<P>
 Frieda's, which distributes more than 400 exotic fruits, vegetables and other 
foods, has annual sales of more than $20 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The company's new headquarters building was previously occupied by PCH 
Clothing Co., which moved to Huntington Beach, said Frieda's President Karen 
Caplan. 
</P>
<P>
 "The building found us," Caplan said, explaining that the company had been 
looking for sites near its downtown Los Angeles location to stay close to 
produce dealers. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Los Alamitos building was so perfectly suited, she said, that the 
distance became less important. 
</P>
<P>
 The company was founded in 1962 by Karen Caplan's mother, Frieda Caplan, who 
began selling California brown mushrooms from a stall in the old 7th Street 
wholesale market in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Later that year, Frieda Caplan came across a hairy brown fruit from New 
Zealand called the Chinese gooseberry. She renamed it kiwi and began promoting 
it.

THOSE WITH US FACILITIES STOCK URGED TO PUSH SALE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES S. GRANELLI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A research firm said Friday that shareholders of US Facilities Corp., the 
target of a $79-million hostile takeover bid, should vote against management at 
next week's annual meeting by approving a proposal to put the Costa Mesa 
insurance company up for sale. 
</P>
<P>
 Institutional Shareholder Services in Bethesda, Md., also recommended in a 
private report that shareholders vote at Wednesday's meeting for two director 
candidates nominated by the pursuer, Fidelity National Financial Inc. in 
Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think Fidelity is offering an attractive premium," said David Drake, a 
senior analyst at the research firm. Though he was willing to discuss the 
report, he would not release it because it was paid for by his clients, who 
hold large stakes in US Facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Drake pointed out that a vote for Fidelity's proposals would simply force 
negotiations that could lead to a higher price for the stock. 
</P>
<P>
 He also said that US Facilities has misled shareholders on several issues 
involved in the $15-a-share offer and Fidelity's annual meeting proposals. 
</P>
<P>
 Raising questions, for instance, about the credibility of the offer and 
Fidelity's ability to finance an acquisition were not justified, he said. 
Fidelity appears to be serious, he said, and able -- with $104 million from a 
public debt offering in February -- to buy US Facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Institutional shareholders tend to agree. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think that they are serious and have the financial wherewithal to complete 
the deal," said Gary N. Siegler, a partner in SC Fundamental Inc., a New York 
money manager that holds the largest single stake -- 9.8% -- in US Facilities.

 US Facilities was trading at $9 a share when Fidelity, the nation's 
fifth-largest title insurance company, began aggressively acquiring its stock 
near the end of March. It closed Friday at $13.0625 a share, down 43.75 cents, 
on the Nasdaq market. 
</P>
<P>
 "We still contend that this is not an offer," said US Facilities spokeswoman 
Cecilia A. Wilkinson. "Fidelity National is on a fishing expedition and has not 
offered a firm price for the company. It has admitted that its $15-a-share 
offer is not a firm price and is subject to reduction." 
</P>
<P>
 Fidelity said at one point that the price could be modified if a review of US 
Facilities books showed that its investments and other assets were 
"significantly overstated," its debts "significantly understated" or its 
earnings "not sustainable." 
</P>
<P>
 Fidelity said it wanted to conduct that review "because we think that we may 
be able to increase our proposed price, not decrease it."

MAN HELD IN COMPUTER-EQUIPMENT FRAUD CASE 
</P>

 A man is in custody on suspicion of defrauding several computer distributors 
of millions of dollars' worth of computer parts and equipment, then sending his 
profits to his native Pakistan, Fullerton police said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Fullerton Police Sgt. Mike Maynard, Naveed Hameed, 31, owner of a 
computer store in Fullerton, paid for the merchandise with checks that he 
stopped payment on immediately afterward. He then sold the parts to computer 
buffs and wholesalers "at cheap prices," Maynard said. 
</P>
<P>
 Maynard said Hameed put the profits in two accounts with Bank of America, then 
transferred the money by wire to a bank in his native Pakistan. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said Hameed may have defrauded from six to 30 distributors -- most from 
Orange and Los Angeles counties -- of between $2 million and $3 million, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past two weeks Hameed purchased "somewhere in the neighborhood of 
$2.5-million worth of parts and equipment, and he has wired close to $1 million 
to a (Pakistani) bank account," Maynard said. 
</P>
<P>
 That sort of scheme is known in business circles as a "bust-out," and its 
outcome leaves victims reeling because the plotter usually disappears, 
according to police. Bust-outs are a problem in the computer industry, said 
experts, who cited a similar case two months ago in Corona in which computer 
distributors lost $2 million to people who later disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
 Hameed, who lives in Anaheim Hills, was arrested Thursday afternoon at his 
business, Micro America Inc., 1009 N. Placentia Ave. Eleven other people, most 
of them employees, were detained for questioning but later released, Maynard 
said. None of them was involved in the scheme, Maynard said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hameed was arrested just hours before he apparently was to fly to Pakistan 
with more than $1 million in cash, Maynard said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hameed is being held without bail at the Fullerton City Jail pending 
arraignment next Tuesday on grand theft and stolen property charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Police recovered about $1 million worth of parts and equipment at Hameed's 
place of business and at his home, Maynard said.

BOND YIELDS RISE, STOCKS END MIXED; MARKETS: THE DOLLAR SLIPS AGAINST THE MARK 
AND YEN. INFLATION FEARS RETURN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Bond yields rose sharply Friday as rising commodity prices fueled inflation 
fears and the dollar slumped to a two-week low against the German mark. 
</P>
<P>
 But stocks ended mixed, despite the rising interest rates and the falling 
dollar. 
</P>
<P>
 The Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond yield closed at 7.30%, up from 7.23% on 
Thursday. Its price, which moves in the opposite direction, fell 25/32 point, 
or $7.81 per $1,000 in face value. 
</P>
<P>
 The day began with bonds trading lower because of a selloff overseas before 
the U.S. markets opened, said John Canavan, an analyst with Stone & McCarthy 
Research Associates Inc. in Princeton, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
 And with the Federal Reserve Board's short-term interest rate increases out of 
the way for now, and no important economic data for guidance, the bond market 
followed the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar spent the day falling against the German mark and the Japanese yen, 
among other key currencies. A weaker dollar makes dollar-denominated securities 
less valuable to foreign investors. 
</P>
<P>
 In New York, the dollar fetched 1.647 German marks, down from Thursday's 
1.657. The greenback fell to 104.05 Japanese yen, down from 104.25. 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar opened lower against the mark in Europe, as the German currency 
retained strength from comments Thursday by Bundesbank President Hans Tietmeyer 
that interest rates will remain steady. Traders watched for central bank 
intervention as the dollar selloff continued, and when no action was taken, the 
currency continued to fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, futures prices of most commodities, including gold, oil and grains, 
advanced. 
</P>
<P>
 Gold shot higher on the New York Comex, closing at $385.90 an ounce, up $4.50. 
Light, sweet crude oil settled at $18.92 per barrel, up 47 cents, at the New 
York Merc, its highest level in almost a year. 
</P>
<P>
 This was considered a sign of inflation, which the bond market abhors because 
it erodes the value of fixed-income securities such as Treasury notes. 
</P>
<P>
 Canavan also said there was volatility in the market as futures options 
expired about 1 p.m. and traders rushed to square their positions. The long 
bond fell as much as 1 1/32 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Stocks followed bond prices lower most of the day, but buy programs kicked in 
near the close and pushed the Dow Jones industrial average into positive 
territory. The blue chip average ended up 7.37 to 3,766.35, boosting the week's 
gains to 106.67. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow lost as much as 17 points by midafternoon. Then options expirations 
prompted program traders to move in. 
</P>
<P>
 However, declining issues outnumbered advancers by 1,145 to 1,030 on the New 
York Stock Exchange, where 293.52 million shares changed hands, down from 
307.35 million on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Broad-market indexes were mixed. The NYSE's composite index fell 0.58 to 
251.58. The Standard & Poor's composite index fell 1.56 to 454.92. The Nasdaq 
composite index of mostly smaller companies fell 0.61 to 726.70. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Friday's stock market highlights:  
</P>
<P>
 * Autodesk dropped 2 3/4 to 50 1/4. Prudential Securities and Alex. Brown cut 
their estimates, citing a product delay. 
</P>
<P>
 * Amoco gained 2 to 58 1/4 and Prudential Securities upgraded the stock to 
"buy" from "hold." 
</P>
<P>
 * Chrysler, which raised its dividend 25% on Thursday, gained 1 3/8 to 48 1/2. 
Ford added 5/8 to 59 3/4 and General Motors tacked on 1/8 to 55 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Kansas City Southern eased 1 3/8 to 44 1/8. The stock was up sharply earlier 
in the week on speculation its rail unit may be sold for $2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 * Conrail, hit by a surprise strike that led to a halt of rail operations, 
ended down 1 at 53 3/4. Other rails were weak, with CSX down 2 3/4 to 73 1/4 
and Burlington Northern off 1 3/8 at 56. 
</P>
<P>
 * Philip Morris rose 2 1/2 to 53 3/4 after falling 1 3/4 on Thursday in 
reaction to reports of an anti-smoking legal campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 * Sears rose 1 1/8 to 50 7/8, Chevron rose 1 to 88 3/4, IBM advanced 1 to 62 
3/8 and International Paper added 1 to 69 3/8. But Walt Disney lost 1 1/8 to 43 
1/8 and Caterpillar fell 3/8 to 110 1/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Bank stocks stumbled on the rise in interest rates. BankAmerica fell 1 1/8 
to 47 1/2. Citicorp lost 5/8 to 39. 
</P>
<P>
 Stocks closed higher in foreign trading. Tokyo's 225-share Nikkei average 
ended up 120.83 at 20,342.17. In Europe, Frankfurt's DAX 30-share average 
closed at 2,249.65, up 1.89 points, while in London, the Financial Times 
100-share average gained 4.5 points to end at 3,127.3. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexico City's Bolsa Index closed 12.39 points higher at 2,417.3.
