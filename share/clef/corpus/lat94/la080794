WAR & PEACE, PART II; THE 'RUSSIAN J.D. SALINGER' TURNS TO THE BROAD CANVAS TO 
WRITE A TOLSTOYAN NOVEL OF THE 20TH CENTURY; GENERATIONS OF WINTER, BY VASSILY 
AKSYONOV . TRANSLATED BY JOHN GLAD AND CHRISTOPHER MORRIS (RANDOM HOUSE: $25; 
600 PP.)  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Adam Hochschild, Adam Hochschild's most recent book is The Unquiet Ghost: 
Russians Remember Stalin (Viking Penguin). His earlier Half the Way Home: a 
Memoir of Father and Son was recently reprinted as a Penguin paperback. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Near the end of her memoirs of Stalin's gulag, the writer Eugenia Ginzburg 
describes an extraordinary scene. She had just finished many years' 
imprisonment in Ko lyma -- the harshest, coldest, most feared region of the 
vast labor camp system, in the far northeast corner of Siberia, not far from 
Alaska. Like most newly-released prisoners, Ginzburg had to remain in internal 
exile for some years more. Her husband had also vanished into the gulag, and, 
while she was in prison, one of her two sons had died in the siege of 
Leningrad. But the authorities permitted her surviving son to join her in 
exile. In 1948, he made the long trip to Kolyma, a 16-year-old with a knapsack 
on his back. She had not seen him for 11 years, and greatly feared they would 
have nothing in common. But "I found myself catching my breath with joyful 
astonishment when that very first night he started to recite from memory the 
very poems that had been my constant companions during my fight for survival in 
the camps." 
</P>
<P>
 To Russian readers the scene is even more moving, because they know that this 
tall, thin teen-ager with his knapsack grew up to become Vassily Aksyonov, one 
of the best-loved dissident writers of the 1960s and '70s. 
</P>
<P>
 Aksyonov stayed on in Kolyma with his mother for several years. There has been 
surprisingly little about the world of the gulag in his books so far, even 
though he left the reach of Soviet censors when he moved to the United States 
14 years ago. He used a little of his Kolyma experience in his surreal 1980 
novel "The Burn," but there and in other books, his characteristic voice has 
been one of satire, fantasy and the grotesque, bold stylistic experimentation 
and comic use of slang. Some call Aksyonov a Russian J.D. Salinger. 
</P>
<P>
 "Generations of Winter" is a startling departure from all this. Except for 
occasional flourishes, its form is that of classic late 19th-Century realism, 
something as unexpected from Aksyonov as it would be from Salinger or Pynchon. 
As in what is clearly its model, "War and Peace," the narrator is omniscient, 
and historical characters -- Stalin, Molotov, Beria and others -- stroll 
through the pages along with home-grown ones. Although Aksyonov's characters 
are not as memorable as Tolstoy's (whose are?), this is as absorbing as any 
novel I have come across in the last few years. I read it past bedtime at night 
and before getting to work in the morning, and found my mind wandering off to 
it during the day. 
</P>
<P>
 One reason people write fewer traditional realist novels these days is that 
modern readers are jaded. Film, radio, first-person journalism, prying 
biographers and, above all, TV, have saturated us with reality. And so who are 
you, impudent novelist, to make up details about a prisoner's interrogation, or 
about what food was served at a Kremlin reception, or about what passed through 
Stalin's mind as he greeted his guests? 
</P>
<P>
 Aksyonov, however, has the authority to tell all this, and much more. His 
father was a high party official and member of the Central Executive Committee 
of the U.S.S.R. Both his parents spent many years in the gulag. Aksyonov 
himself grew up among exiles, the bereaved and survivors. Yet even if we did 
not know all this about him, we would hear no false notes in this novel. 
Everything rings true. Take this passing description of well-to-do players on a 
Moscow tennis court in 1930: "All three were representatives of the 'famous 
lawyer' type, a class that had survived the Revolution, returned fully to life, 
and now would take any case except one involving the defense of an accused 
man." 
</P>
<P>
 "Generations of Winter" pans across a quarter century of Soviet history, from 
1921 to 1945. At center stage is the Gradov family, and their children, friends 
and relatives, all members of that caste which in Russia has always thought of 
itself as a race apart, the intelligentsia. Boris Gradov is a distinguished 
surgeon; his wife Mary is a pianist. Under the steadily darkening sky of those 
years, their dacha on the outskirts of Moscow is an oasis of music, books, 
poetry, good food and spirited talk. 
</P>
<P>
 The times sweep several of the Gradovs into prison, or into World War II, or, 
in one case, both. Army general Nikita Gradov, the eldest son, is arrested in 
Stalin's Great Purge of the late 1930s. After four years as a slave laborer in 
the gold mines of Kolyma, emaciated and barely alive, he is plucked from the 
gulag and given a high army command. A story most improbable -- except that 
such things happened. Some of the officers who led the Red Army to victory, 
such as Gen. (later Marshal) Konstantin Rokossovsky and Gen. Alexander 
Gorbatov, had been half-starved prisoners a few months before. Russian history 
has always been stranger than fiction. 
</P>
<P>
 One thing that gives that history its aura of tragedy is that there seem so 
many turning points when it could have taken a different course. What if the 
Bolsheviks had not established their all-powerful secret police in 1917? What 
if they had not dissolved the Constituent Assembly of 1918, chosen in the first 
real free elections Russia had ever known? What if they had not suppressed the 
Kronstadt revolt of 1921? 
</P>
<P>
 Kronstadt was perhaps the last of the great "what if's." After it was over, 
the Soviet Union's course was fixed inevitably toward an absolutism more 
terrible than that of the czars. Thousands of radical sailors on the Baltic 
fortress island of Kronstadt mutinied against the government. They demanded 
such things as elections by secret ballot, free trade unions and the freeing of 
political prisoners. Trotsky and Lenin sent troops across the ice to crush the 
rebellion, with heavy loss of life on both sides. 
</P>
<P>
 In "Generations of Winter," the young officer Nikita Gradov follows orders to 
help suppress the revolt. Sick at heart, he knows that he is betraying what he 
had hoped the Russian Revolution would be. For the rest of his life memories of 
Kronstadt haunt him. They come pouring out even when he is beaten into a state 
of delirium by secret police interrogators 16 years later. 
</P>
<P>
 For Nikita's father, the surgeon, the key act of betrayal comes in 1925. 
Officials ask him to give his medical opinion that army commander Mikhail 
Frunze needs an operation. (At the time, apparently, several doctors were 
pressured into doing this. Frunze, potentially a strong rival to Stalin, then 
died mysteriously during the surgery.) When Dr. Gradov at first balks, secret 
policemen make veiled threats against his daughter, and he gives in. 
</P>
<P>
 These two early betrayals set the pattern for more. The political betrayals 
are echoed by sexual betrayals. As with Dr. Gradov and his son, sometimes even 
these are almost life-and-death choices: Thrown into the gulag, Nikita Gradov's 
wife, a great beauty, becomes the mistress of a camp commandant to gain herself 
enough food to survive. When she and her husband are released and reunited, he 
sees her well- fed body and realizes what has happened. He cannot forgive her. 
The virus of betrayal then travels down through the generations to their 
teen-age son. He runs away from home to join the Red Army, only to find himself 
behind the lines fighting not the Germans, but the Soviet Union's nominal ally, 
the Poles. 
</P>
<P>
 Few of the characters in this novel are untarnished, and that is part of its 
emotional accuracy. The toll taken in any tyranny is not measured only in 
physical suffering, but also in complicity. The prisoner who has almost starved 
can recover; the friend whose denunciation sent him or her to prison never can. 
And even without denunciations, tens of millions of Soviets had to make 
countless other betrayals to keep their jobs or their lives: teachers taught 
history they knew was false; scientists embraced Lysenko's wishful-thinking 
biology; writers hailed Stalin as the greatest genius of all time. 
</P>
<P>
 With a hand never too heavy, Aksyonov shows us what it was like to live 
through such times. Moreover, he gives us men and women who are painfully aware 
of their complicity, but who must go on living nonetheless. And go on they do: 
At the end of "Generation of Winter's" 600 pages some cycles of action are 
uncompleted, others are newly begun and key characters are still in moral 
transit. One senses a sequel to come. I await it eagerly.

VAGABOND BLUES; GAY NEW YORK: GENDER, URBAN CULTURE, AND THE MAKING OF THE GAY 
MALE WORLD, 1890-1940, BY GEORGE CHAUNCEY (BASIC BOOKS: $25; 478 PP., 
ILLUSTRATED)  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Wayne Koestenbaum, Wayne Koestenbaum is the author of The Queen's Throat: 
Opera, Homosexuality, and the Mystery of Desire, and two collections of poetry, 
including the recently published Rhapsodies of a Repeat Offender. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 What would homosexuality be, without its penumbra of covert locations? The 
genius of George Chauncey's "Gay New York" is its respect for vanished 
bathhouses, tearooms and saloons where gays cruised and commingled; its respect 
for homosexualities of the street corner, pier and park -- all those lost, 
aromatic rendezvous. Even if you are not a devotee of theory or history, you 
will want to read "Gay New York" for its profusion of anecdotal detail -- its 
coordinates of a gay Atlantis, a buried city of Everard Baths, Harlem drag 
balls and Vaseline Alley. Chauncey has found evidence -- in police and court 
records, in the popular press, in diaries -- of a gay underworld whose 
complexity and cohesion no previous historian dared imagine. 
</P>
<P>
 "Gay New York," however, isn't just the definitive history of gays in New York 
from 1890 through 1940; it's also a wonderful account of the metropolitan 
character of modern gayness itself. You may remember, reading "Gay New York," 
how sexuality first woke in you as an emanation of avenue and marquee, a shabby 
sign advertising "Rooms" -- how sexuality, in fact, may have seemed the very 
perfume of the "urban" or the "urbane." 
</P>
<P>
 Chauncey remaps the inner as well as the outer metropolis: if modern queer 
self-conceptions are ruled by the Scylla and Charybdis of the closet and coming 
out, Chauncey proves the limitations of those terms. Originally, the concept of 
gay coming out spoofed the debutante's; coming out didn't mean disclosing one's 
homosexuality to straights, but rather, it meant initiation into gay networks. 
Once tuned into those networks, one wasn't in the closet; one was afoot in a 
wild and full (if sequestered) world. Overreliance on the closet as a term 
describing gay life before Stonewall gives short shrift to tearoom and 
bathhouse, sites unseen by straights but vested, slantly, with presence. The 
slantness -- the obliquity -- was part of the game; the gay world could thrive 
because its argot was not widely understood. For example, until the 1930s or 
even later, one could could call a restaurant gay, even in print, and only 
insiders would know the word's significance. 
</P>
<P>
 The most remarkable aspect of Gay New York is its argument that homosexuality 
was visible on the streets of New York decades before it appeared in medical 
journals and juridical records. Chauncey argues against the common premise that 
there was no visible gay culture until Stonewall, and that homosexuality first 
appeared as a concept within arcane sexology circles, only later trickling down 
into ordinary people's consciousness. 
</P>
<P>
 Prime among these originating types of the homosexual was the so-called 
"fairy" -- an effeminate man, often a prostitute, often in drag -- who was a 
recognized figure in the Bowery as early as 1870, 25 years before Oscar Wilde's 
trial. Just as drag queens catalyzed gay liberation at Stonewall, so were 
fairies, in the late 19th Century, the first to step, hairpins dropping, into 
the streets. Chauncey frequently reminds us, indeed, of the "continuing 
centrality of gender inversion to gay culture"; the flaming fairy, though he 
seems a mere stereotype to be discarded or "transcended," is actually a 
resonant provocateur, ignored at our peril. 
</P>
<P>
 By tracing gay New York demimondes back to Bowery fairies, Chauncey implies 
that gender blur and outrageousness are crucial to gay history and politics. 
Indeed, the contemporary Puritanical drive to mainstream queer culture by 
having it renounce excess is not a progressive tendency. In the history of 
homosexual identity one sees repeated the brutal story of the fairy's 
expulsion: as middle-class men sought to define their masculinity around 
heterosexuality, the fairy, with his deliberate effeminacy, became the easy 
scapegoat. We reprise that scape-goating when we banish femmes from 
gay-affirmative discourse. Masculinity needs to be eroded; in dismantling 
masculinity, we should look to fairy culture for guidance. 
</P>
<P>
 To fairy culture, Chauncey demonstrates, we owe treasures of homosexual 
manner, too often deemed a shameful inheritance: makeup, perfume, mincing, 
dishing. . . . No nuance of camp culture is accidental; each is worth mining 
and memorializing. Chauncey shows us how overdetermined and rich are the 
origins of camp culture, particularly its cult of such movie stars as Tallulah 
Bankhead, Marlene Dietrich and Mae West. Mae West, it seems, modeled her own 
mannerisms after those of fairies, who were themselves imitating female 
prostitutes. (Some enterprising publisher should reissue Mae West's pioneering 
play, "The Drag," which included an unscripted drag ball of the sort that 
Chauncey chronicles in "Gay New York" -- drag balls which, attended by 
thousands, represent the most public manifestation of pre-WWI New York gay 
life.) 
</P>
<P>
 Chauncey's book should also remind us of toleration's tenuousness. Now gays 
seem more or less accepted, at least in urban circles; gays are even subject to 
intense -- if often unreliable -- media coverage. However, we should remain 
aware of the potentially subversive relation that homosexuality bears to the 
stultifying regime of "normalcy." When we demand that gays resemble the "norm," 
we banish eccentricity and individuality; and when we banish perversity, we 
retreat into prototypes of fascism. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that homosexuals have the monopoly on subversion. Indeed, assignations 
between so-called "fairy" and "trade" undermine our current complacent sense of 
an absolute divergence between "hetero" and "homo." At the turn of the century, 
having sex with a fairy didn't make you queer. It meant you were "trade." Thus 
Chauncey dismantles heterosexuality and homosexuality: imagine a world where 
men having sex with men didn't signify ineluctable membership in a prohibited 
identity. Before WWI, men who would now be "confined" to straightness could "go 
both ways." That freedom explains the still controversial Kinsey Report, which 
demonstrated the frequency with which men (at least in earlier eras) had 
homosexual experiences without defining themselves as gay. 
</P>
<P>
 The early 20th-Century Greenwich Village and Harlem demimondes that Chauncey 
chronicles were hardly utopias. Fairies were often bashed; the consequences of 
being arrested for sodomy or indecency or soliciting -- whatever the name, the 
crime was the same -- were severe. We don't know how many lives were ruined in 
this fashion. The early modern world of fairies and trade, of the Y and the 
"pansy craze," may not have been sheer gravy, but it was better than the 1950s. 
For someone like myself, born in the Cold War era of the closet, "Gay New York" 
recreates a fantasy marketplace of flaming men, a bazaar where sexual 
identities weren't yet fully scripted, a louche time of speak-easies and 
bachelor flats. After Prohibition's repeal, backlash set in; homosexuality 
disappeared from the streets and retreated into bars, themselves fragile 
institutions, frequently raided. A bar that willingly served a gay person lost 
its license. Thus began the descent into what we remember as the closet, false 
foundation from which gay lib erupted. 
</P>
<P>
 Every city needs its George Chauncey. Now someone should unearth gay L.A. In 
days of yore, where did men cruise? Where were the back rooms? Who found 
themselves in back rooms and how did those men conceptualize their conduct? 
Every city needs sexual explication. Every city is a tabula rasa upon which sex 
inscribes its demotic scrawl, an intricate text commanding awe and deserving 
patient translation.

A HEART OF GOLD; BIG DREAMS: INTO THE HEART OF CALIFORNIA, BY BILL BARICH 
(PANTHEON BOOKS: $24; 560 PP.)  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Page Stegner, Page Stegner is the author of three California novels and 
three collections of essays on the American West. He is director of the 
Creative Writing Program at the University of California, Santa Cruz. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Books about California are not in short supply. A.H. Watkins once noted in his 
own opus on lotus land, "One glance at the bibliography of any general history 
might convince the uninformed observer that California was an elderly national 
power with approximately twelve centuries of history to recall, not a mere 
American state with hardly more than two hundred years of a recognizable past." 
To this we might add, one glance at the recommended reading list provided in 
most literary anthologies devoted to West Coast writings will convince even the 
informed observer that there isn't enough tenure in one life time to peruse all 
the worthy prose expanded in explication of the Golden State. So why do we need 
more? 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly one of the dreams that persists in the mind of any self respecting 
California writer is the fantasy that someday somebody is going to get it 
right, somebody is really going to explain the region in all its immensity and 
complexity. And it just might be . . . well, if not all those who went before, 
(Twain, London, Norris, Muir, Miller, Steinbeck, Jeffers, Austin, West, 
Chandler, Kerouac, Saroyan, Stegner, Snyder, Everson, Didion, Houston, Haslam, 
to name a random few), why not, perhaps, Bill Barich. "I'd probe at California 
to see what made it tick," Barich says of his own motivation. "If I hoped to 
take stock of my life out West, I reckoned that I should also take a stock of 
some other lives and visions, listening to my fellow dreamers while I explored 
our common bonds." 
</P>
<P>
 To his great credit he does what he sets out to do, and he does it with wit 
and style. In a way "Big Dreams: Into the Heart of California" reminds one of 
"Least Heat Moon's Blue Highways," perhaps because of the engaging narrative 
voice and wry sense of humor, perhaps because because both authors are in 
flight from a disintegrating relationship and both are on a personal odyssey, 
taking stock of their own reality through the metaphysical investigation of 
other lives, other habitats. 
</P>
<P>
 Barich wanders from the Oregon border to the Mexican port-of-entry at San 
Ysidro, zigging and zagging along the way from the Pacific coast to the Sierra 
Nevada, down the long San Joaquin Valley, over the transverse ranges into the 
L.A. Basin, out into the Mojave and south into the Coachella Valley. But the 
route is unimportant. It's the people he meets, "other lives and visions" that 
are at issue, and the ways in which the varying landscapes of California both 
form and inform these people. 
</P>
<P>
 On Barich's journey we meet a remarkable variety of folks, all those sons and 
daughters of the golden west who were either born into or lured from other 
climes by its promise of "the great life." Some are historical figures, like 
John Sutter, John Muir, Robert Louis Stevenson, William Brewer, Edwin Bryant. 
Some are everyday people like the cattle ranching Albaugh family in the Fall 
River Valley, or the Crettols, "a modern California farming family" in the San 
Joaquin Valley. Some are famous, like Caesar Chavez, Walt Disney, and "the 
Ultimate Californian," Ronald Reagan; some are infamous, like the most 
celebrated tenant of the Corcoran State Prison facilities at Avenal, Charles 
Manson. 
</P>
<P>
 Sandwiched between the more extensive and reflective portraits are dozens of 
vignettes, such as the teen-age clerk in a Yolo County country store, "a 
snuffly boy who was putting in some time at work until he had to leave for 
school. It was early June, and he had to last through a couple more weeks of 
painful education before he would be free to lean on his broom all day." Asking 
him what it was that was growing in the fields across the road from the store, 
Barich receives no information. "He didn't know that answer and didn't want to 
know the answer. Talk of farming bored him. He moped by the cash register and 
hung his head, as if I'd caught him out at class, and finally called to his 
boss. . . . 'Customer has a question,' he shouted." 
</P>
<P>
 Piece by piece these portraits, sketches, anecdotes and vignettes add up to an 
extraordinary profile of the Californian and his habitat, but it is an 
impressionistic canvas we are observing, not a trompe l'oeil. The narrative 
method reflects something of the vastness of Barich's task. The problem that 
anyone trying to recreate the California experience runs into is that it won't 
stay still long enough to have its picture taken, and it's too big to fit 
between the boards. Barich could be describing the whole state when he refers 
to Los Angeles as "never quite what it (appears) to be and forever staying one 
step ahead of interpretation." 
</P>
<P>
 There are, of course, many Californias -- 9 by some counts; 6 according to 
Gary Snyder, though Snyder gives away the Mojave to Arizona, the Sonoran 
deserts to Mexico and the north coast to Oregon/Washington. It has a land mass 
of 158,693 square miles, considerably larger than Maine, New Hampshire, 
Vermont, New York, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, and New Jersey all 
lumped together (124,020 square miles). It is urban, suburban, rural. It is 
rain forest at one end, desert at the other (and not one desert, but three), 
high mountains along its eastern margin, Pacific ocean along its western. It 
has large populations of Asians, Hispanics, African Americans, Native 
Americans. It is not an easy task to consolidate such a polymorphous society 
living in their redwood, rhododendron, oak, manzanita, madrone, chaparral, 
creosote bush, shadscale, cactus environment into a single conceit called, "the 
Heart of California." But Bill Barich does it as well as it can be done.

FORGET APRIL, IT'S AUGUST IN PARIS; AMBITION AND LOVE, BY WARD JUST (HOUGHTON 
MIFFLIN: $22.95; 288 PP.)  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Christopher Dickey, Christopher Dickey is the Middle East editor for 
Newsweek. He lives in Paris. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 August in Paris is the month of the Americans. The avenues are wide open, the 
parks are full of shaded romantic corners, and while most of the French have 
followed each other to the sea like lemmings, just enough remain to keep open 
the critical mass of cafes. Americans love this season because without the 
hard-to-take Parisians, the city is so easy, "so lush and accessible, so 
graceful and finished, loaded with lore," as the narrator of Ward Just's new 
novel tells us. And if I were going to Paris just now and wanted a feel for the 
place and for the particularity of the American experience there, I would take 
this book with me this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, "Ambition and Love" has about it an air of anachronism, but its 
subjects make that inevitable. It tells the story of an American writer -- a 
man -- and an American painter -- a woman -- who knew each other a little bit 
in Chicago and didn't fall in love, and don't fall in love again, but who 
shared a certain dream of what their lives could be if they devoted themselves 
to their art -- and who believed that Paris would be the place to do that. 
</P>
<P>
 As long as there have been Americans abroad, from Thomas Jefferson to Jimi 
Hendrix, Paris has given them a mixture of inspiration and indifference that 
caused them to thrive, then let them. But for writers and painters, the 1920s 
were the great moment, and in the popular mind of America, the city has 
remained frozen like a wax museum filled with figures from les annees folles . 
The peculiar excitement experienced by American provincials faced with 
cosmopolitan grandeur and the glorious hedonism that followed World War I is 
not to be repeated. But the shades of Hemingway and Fitzgerald and the Murphys 
linger on, and authors flock to Paris now not so much for inspiration as in 
emulation. 
</P>
<P>
 The writer in this book, Harry Forrest, has settled for the good life along 
the banks of the Seine, browsing the bookstalls to check the prices put on used 
copies of his mystery novels. Those too are about the city. District by 
district. "Inspector Pease and the First Arrondissement," " . . . and the 
Second Arrondissement," and so on, spiraling along the historical nautilus of 
the metropolitan map from fashionable houseboats along the Seine near Notre 
Dame to the dreary immigrant-filled streets of the 10th, which is where his 
wife decides to leave him, sick of doing his research, and tired of 
deracination. 
</P>
<P>
 He would have us believe that after 20 years she had become too snob , too 
BCBG ( bon chic, bon genre : preppy, bourgeois). But it's she who goes back to 
the States. Harry has become too comfortable in the American niche. "La Belle 
France -- so supple on the surface, and so glacial underneath," an old 
expatriate journalist tells him. "You will admire the bedrock. You will approve 
of it -- because you've never stubbed your toe on it. Let me tell you, Harry. 
It hurts like hell. But because you're an absentee American, you're excused. 
This is a fact you will come to appreciate, and cling to for dear life." 
</P>
<P>
 Not so Georgia Whyte, the painter, who knew Harry when she was a beautiful 
young girl from the less respectable side of the tracks and his brother brought 
her to a country club dance in Winnetka. In middle age she has become that 
other kind of American who comes to create in Paris: one who has little 
familiarity with the language or interest in the culture or desire to learn. "I 
have elected to live as a fugitive among strangers, remote from the life of my 
own nation, unconnected to the life of this one," she writes to her relatives. 
Yet she blends in very quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 They have not seen each other for decades when he runs into her at the Musee 
D'Orsay, which is one setting earlier writers could not have exploited. It used 
to be a train station. But since the late 1980s, with its chaotic open spaces 
filled by non-threatening art from the 19th Century, it suits the mood 
especially well of foreigners who want at once to lose themselves in the city 
and to be in a place that they know. When they meet, both Harry and Georgia are 
eyeing the genre painter Couture's enormous canvas " Les Romains de la 
Decadence ," which oddly prefigured the life if not the art of les annees 
folles . The disapproving bust of Caesar glowering over the Roman orgy "bears a 
passing resemblance to the Ohio Republican Warren G. Harding," Forrest informs 
us. But now the painting just looks like campy romanticism. Decadence is so 
much easier to enjoy than to capture. 
</P>
<P>
 Over carafes of wine in a nearby brasserie, Georgia tells Harry her story, and 
he tells us. It's a tale of ambition and, if not love, then lovers; a simple 
narrative but a complicated problem as she moves from Chicago to L.A., from the 
man of her life to a menage a trois, then to Paris and solitary confinement 
with her canvas. She sacrifices long relationships and the possibilities of 
quick success in order to keep painting exactly what she wants to paint. And in 
the end, she produces work that satisfies her and disturbs others, and she is 
found by a man who marries her, and she has a beautiful child and gets the hell 
out of Paris (if only to the rural delights of remote Auvergne). She satisfies 
her ambition. She gets love. While Harry is left with no wife and no work he 
can really be proud of. "Her life was triumphant," he concludes. 
</P>
<P>
 Sure. It's a fairy tale. But that's what Paris is about for those who come to 
it from America; the Oz where a woodman gets a heart and the scarecrow a brain, 
and the would-be artist gets respect. The death of Harry's friend, the old 
expatriate journalist, "was mourned in every arrondissement. His memorial 
service filled Saint Philippe du Roule." When an immigrant songwriter dies, the 
streets are overflowing with distraught fans. "You cannot know what it is to be 
mourned by a city," Georgia dreams afterward, "to have your work so revered 
that the public weeps, comes with flowers to the front door of your house, 
feels your death as it feels the death of a beloved member of the family, 
remembers your most casual and thoughtless remarks as emblems of a whole 
nation, is drawn to you as iron to a magnet, sees you in their dreams, adores 
you, would raise you from the dead if they could." 
</P>
<P>
 Paris was ever, and remains, a place where a man or woman from America could 
invent themselves as artists, even if they were not very good ones, and could 
dare to think they'll be loved. For most, that is ambition enough.

FOCUS; DISCOVERY CHANNEL'S REFRESHER COURSE ON WATERGATE; FIVE-PART DOCUMENTARY 
ON NIXON SCANDAL EXPLAINS, CONFIRMS AND, AT TIMES, REVEALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The final surprise of Richard Nixon's career might well have taken place after 
his death April 22. Instead of being lambasted with vituperative op-ed memoirs 
and obits, Nixon was memorialized as a complicated politician with as many 
gifts as flaws. Several writers even suggested that Nixon's efforts to ratchet 
down the Cold War pressure and open doors to China would overshadow Watergate. 
</P>
<P>
 Watergate -- that single, ominous word encompassing a complex web of crimes 
and misdemeanors woven by Nixon's White House, and the elaborate cover-up Nixon 
and his men devised to conceal those crimes. The Watergate scandal forced Nixon 
to resign from office in August, 1972. As ex-President, he strove for 20 years 
to rehabilitate himself. Could it be that Watergate might become a footnote in 
history? 
</P>
<P>
 Not if British TV producers Brian Lapping and Norma Percy have anything to do 
with it. Just as the posthumous image of Nixon was beginning to soften, along 
comes the devastating, five-part series "Watergate," by Lapping's U.K.-based 
production company, Brian Lapping Associates, and co-produced by the British 
Broadcasting Corp. and the Discovery Channel. 
</P>
<P>
 At nearly 230 minutes, "Watergate" is television's first exhaustive 
documentation -- based on former London Times Washington correspondent Fred 
Emery's new book "Watergate" -- of the events that led to the United States' 
most serious modern constitutional crisis. Just as striking is how the 
Lapping-Percy team (including producer-director Paul Mitchell) managed to lure 
on camera virtually every important and secondary participant in the Watergate 
plot, cover-up and investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those who break their decades-long silence is James McCord, who 
participated in the White House-authorized June 17, 1972, break-in of the 
Democratic Party National Headquarters at Washington's Watergate Hotel, 
triggering the White House cover-up of a series of illegal, pre-Watergate 
wiretaps and break-ins. 
</P>
<P>
 Other notorious Watergate figures who speak on camera include Nixon campaign 
intelligence head G. Gordon Liddy, campaign deputy director Jeb Magruder, and 
Nixon's key aides H.R. Haldeman (filmed eight months before his death in 
November, 1993) and John Ehrlichman. Above them all is host-narrator Daniel 
Schorr, whose Watergate reports for CBS News earned him a position on Nixon's 
"enemies list." 
</P>
<P>
 Given Lapping's previous remarkable documentary, "The Second Russian 
Revolution," the power of this detailed but lucid new report on a scandal 
barely known to a generation of TV viewers isn't unexpected. What is, though, 
is the story of how Lapping and Percy arrived at their report. 
</P>
<P>
 As the pair sit at a large glass table in a Los Angeles hotel suite, they 
occasionally look over at the man who blew the lid on the Watergate cover-up -- 
former Nixon counsel John W. Dean. A few minutes later, Schorr arrives at the 
suite and sits across the table from Dean -- former combatants, now friendly 
partners in helping promote a series they both insist is the accurate account 
of the scandal. 
</P>
<P>
 Dean's contacts with the British producers, however, were not always so rosy. 
</P>
<P>
 "When Brian and Norma first reached me," Dean recalls, "I wanted nothing to do 
with them. I suggested to them that the story they were trying to tell was 
phony." 
</P>
<P>
 When Lapping learned, in 1991, of Len Colodny's and Robert Gettlin's 
controversial new Watergate book, "Silent Coup," he thought that here was the 
stuff for "a provocative, startling look at Watergate with completely new 
information. It was on this basis that I sold the idea to the BBC and 
Discovery." 
</P>
<P>
 Percy, with Emery and Mitchell, then set out to research the background of 
"Silent Coup." "We began our work," says Percy, "during the 20th anniversary of 
the '72 break-in, and now it airs on the 20th anniversary of Nixon's 
resignation. So the series took nearly as long to make as it took for the 
Watergate scandal to unfold." 
</P>
<P>
 "Silent Coup" made assertions against Dean, and his future wife, Maureen, that 
Lapping believed could form the basis of their documentary. But after six weeks 
of investigation -- including a long search through Nixon's own files at the 
Virginia-based Nixon Project, Percy's team concluded that there was no evidence 
to support "Silent Coup's" thesis. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well," Lapping sighs, "after learning that the whole basis for your series is 
air, where do you go? It actually wasn't as difficult as we had anticipated to 
go back and tell the known story." 
</P>
<P>
 "The real story," says Percy, "is actually the most devastating and dramatic 
of all, but I was deeply concerned all along that young people would either 
never understand the true history, or latch onto some revisionist myth. When my 
two nieces saw the final product on the BBC, though, they were absolutely 
goggle-eyed. That was very gratifying." 
</P>
<P>
 Percy acknowledges that while "Watergate" doesn't definitively prove that 
Nixon ordered the break-in, "it explains how he ordered the espionage action 
plan, carried out by Liddy and (fellow spy E. Howard) Hunt, that included the 
break-in." 
</P>
<P>
 It does even more. Series researcher Jeff Goldberg uncovered a copy of a 
document, signed off by Haldeman, which proves that the White House approved 
Liddy's illegal $300,000 intelligence plan. Dean, who finally accepted 
Lapping's offer to go on camera, wasn't told by Percy of the document until it 
was handed to him while cameras were rolling. On film, Dean calls it "a truly 
amazing document to have surfaced at such a late date," strongly suggesting 
that if Nixon's closest confidant Haldeman knew, "then Nixon knew." 
</P>
<P>
 This kind of dramatic gesture on Percy's part is typical of her interview 
approach. Says Lapping: "Norma makes everyone she talks to feel very 
comfortable, because they can tell that she's done her homework. Eventually, 
they tend to let their guard down and talk frankly on camera." 
</P>
<P>
 When asked why it took so long for TV to get out the full Watergate story, 
Schorr notes that "TV wasn't getting out any of the story when it was 
happening. Stories were breaking in June, 1972, and the networks were focused 
on the two party conventions. Bill Small, CBS' Washington bureau chief, told me 
about 'this Watergate thing,' and that I would be 'the Watergate 
correspondent,' with Leslie Stahl helping me. I wasn't sure what he meant at 
first; that was how in the dark we were about this." 
</P>
<P>
 TV eventually told the world about Watergate, for, "as British youth," Percy 
says, "we were completely glued to the set during the Watergate hearings. 
People in Europe, and elsewhere, followed it every step of the way," 
</P>
<P>
 After all of this time, what is Watergate's lesson? Schorr says that it points 
to the danger of "the mystique of the Presidency, one of only two elective 
offices which all voting Americans select. Taken too far, the mystique works on 
the President, who believes -- as Nixon believed -- that he embodies the 
public's will." 
</P>
<P>
 Dean, leaning back in his chair, mulls it all over: "The only good thing for 
me about Watergate was that I had to tell the truth of what I knew. But if the 
truth is lost in the meantime, it is because people tend to forget. This 
program makes any denial, any forgetting, impossible." 
</P>
<P>
 "Watergate" premieres at 9 p.m. Sunday with parts 1 and 2. It continues 
Monday-Wednesday at 9 p.m. with parts 3, 4 and 5. The documentary in its 
entirety re-airs next Sunday, Aug. 14 at noon.

'TYPED UNTIL 3 A.M.'; KAY BOYLE FOUND AN EFFECTIVE WAY TO SABOTAGE EXPECTATIONS 
THAT SHE BECOME A SERIOUS WRITER; KAY BOYLE: AUTHOR OF HERSELF, BY JOAN MELLEN 
(FARRAR, STRAUS & GIROUX: $35; 576 PP.)  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Regina Marler, Regina Marler is a San Francisco and editor of The Letters of 
Vanessa Bell (Pantheon). 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 On any but the brightest day and in the sunniest frame of mind, the life of 
Kay Boyle reads like a crushing morality tale. Born in 1902 to an enlightened 
mother who took her two young daughters to the Armory show and later consulted 
Alfred Stieglitz about their artistic gifts, Kay Boyle was given every 
opportunity to fulfill her potential -- including the opportunity to rebel. 
That she did not reach that potential by the time she died in 1992, that she 
wasted years on quickly written, poorly revised commercial fiction for the 
Saturday Evening Post and women's magazines, is the tragedy at the heart of 
this engaging, committed life. 
</P>
<P>
 Kay Boyle wrote so much, and so fast, especially in the 1930s and '40s, that 
she began to call her writing "typing." "Typing hard," she would tell her 
friends, or "typed until 3 a.m." 
</P>
<P>
 Katherine Evans Boyle was certain her daughter Kay would be a great writer. 
Her own sister Nina Allender was an artist, and Kay's sister Joan Boyle would 
become a painter and designer. The men in the family were "negatives." Her 
Boyle grandfather, called "Puss," dominated the little group, wistfully longing 
for his daughter-in-law Katherine but thwarting her radical impulses. He 
forbade her to install a darkroom in their house, for instance, though she had 
a letter of advice from Steiglitz. Where Puss could not put a stop to 
Katherine's ambitions, he trivialized them. 
</P>
<P>
 Kay's father was well-meaning but weak, incapable of finding a job without 
Puss's intervention. When Kay found a torn note to a lover near his desk, she 
flushed with anger -- not because he had deceived her mother but because he had 
not seized the possibility of happiness while he could. Kay would not make the 
same mistake. She went to New York at 20, using an early marriage to escape her 
grandfather's house. By 21, she was a published poet and leaving for Normandy 
with her French husband, an expatriate. Kay and Richard Brault carefully 
avoided having children. His engineer's salary was pitifully small, and Boyle 
realized that children and literary genius are not always compatible. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, she began her second autobiographical novel, "Plagued by the 
Nightingale" (the manuscript of her first novel having been lost by a 
publisher), and doggedly pursued editors and influential writers through the 
mail. She felt intellectually isolated and overworked. When the opportunity 
presented itself in 1926, she left Brault for Ernest Walsh, editor of the 
avant-garde journal This Quarter and a man already dying of tuberculosis. Walsh 
told Boyle that her role in life was to pay homage to great men. Surprisingly, 
she never argued with him, but became a tireless promoter of male writers 
(Walsh, Emanuel Carnevali, Robert McAlmon) and an opponent of most women 
writers and later of the women's movement. Perhaps because Walsh was so ill, 
but also as an emblem of their love and of her femininity, Boyle yearned to 
become pregnant. A daughter was born after Walsh's death. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1927, Boyle's stories began to appear in rapid succession in magazines like 
Transition. When published by Harry Crosby's Black Sun Press in 1929, "Short 
Stories" received "the review of a lifetime" from her friend William Carlos 
Williams. "Few women have written like this before," Williams argued, "work 
equal in vigor to anything done by a man but with a twist that brings a new 
light into the whole Sahara of romanticism." 
</P>
<P>
 Boyle, already famous, was now to pioneer what came to be known as "The New 
Yorker story" -- direct, almost colloquial prose, characterized by sudden 
beginnings and ambiguous, often unhappy endings. Katherine Ann Porter called 
these stories "a magnificent performance." Privately, Porter had reservations, 
afraid that Boyle might fall into "egotistical self-exploitation." Other 
reviewers began to complain that Boyle's prose was mannered and her characters 
flat. 
</P>
<P>
 As the Roaring Twenties faded into the Depression, Boyle's "arty" 
preoccupations seemed shallow, and critics searched her work in vain for 
evidence of a social conscience. Had they been less centered on labor concerns, 
the critics might have noticed that Boyle was among the first writers to treat 
homosexuality as a natural variation on the human theme. 
</P>
<P>
 Careless or ignorant of the political dangers, Boyle moved to Austria in 1933 
with her new husband, Laurence Vail, former husband of Peggy Guggenheim. There 
her social conscience would be born, as well as her third daughter (her second 
having arrived before Boyle and Vail married). 
</P>
<P>
 Joan Mellen's biography of Boyle, the first to appear, elaborates two threads 
in the writer's psychological makeup: the urge to fulfill her mother's dreams 
for her and the contradictory need to sabotage them. Babies were one means of 
self-sabotage. Mellen writes that simultaneous with Boyle's third pregnancy 
came "a fresh need for money, so that it seemed as if having babies for Kay 
Boyle was an unconscious rebellion against fulfilling her mother's ancient 
dream for her. Art must give way to commercialism because there wasn't enough 
money." 
</P>
<P>
 Arrogance too was a brake on artistic growth. In Mellen's view, Boyle's 
dismissal of "early warnings about the arch and mannered quality of her prose 
was one important reason why (she) was unable to sustain her early fine 
reputation." "The Crazy Hunter: Three Short Novels" (1938) is perhaps the last 
book Kay Boyle wrote "more for art than money." Returning to America in 1942, 
Boyle threw herself at her typewriter, churning out sentimental stories, 
writing as many as 12 hours a day. 
</P>
<P>
 Edmund Wilson's searing review of her potboiler "Avalanche" (1944) in The New 
Yorker sounded "the death knell for Kay Boyle's reputation as a writer of 
merit." That year, The New Yorker rejected a Kay Boyle story for the first 
time, and in the early 1950s stopped buying her work altogether. Boyle was 
still writing about Europe, though American readers were sick of the war and 
its aftermath. And under McCarthyism, magazines were wary of stories with 
political content. In 1952, Boyle and her third husband, Joseph Frankenstein, 
were subjected to security hearings based on vague rumors of disloyalty. Not 
until 1957 would their names be cleared. 
</P>
<P>
 From the late 1950s on, Kay Boyle reinvented herself as a political activist. 
With the energy she had once devoted to her fiction, she protested the U.S. 
presence in Vietnam, marched with Cesar Chavez, praised the Black Panthers and 
founded a chapter of Amnesty International at San Francisco State College, 
where she taught from 1964-1979. Hard as she worked, one senses her relief that 
her efforts were in the practical realm and that she was no longer expected to 
write serious fiction. 
</P>
<P>
 Struck at the heart by Boyle's "artistic failure of nerve," Mellen dwells on 
possible causes for Boyle's behavior and character, tirelessly returning to 
Katherine Evans Boyle's frustrated ambitions and great expectations for Kay. 
But it is equally possible that in the course of a chaotic and mobile life, 
Boyle's neglected talent simply evaporated. If there is a moral in this 
searching biography, it is to recognize the treasure and guard it well.

NOT SCOTT-FREE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Regarding "Pay 'n' Save" (by Glenn F. Bunting, July 10): Right or wrong, 
praised or condemned, televangelist Gene Scott enjoys his notoriety and 
financial success because, like most celebrities, he has the capacity to give 
the masses a sense of meaning and direction to their often aimless, empty 
lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Countless souls in this world attach themselves to the famous and infamous 
alike, hoping to fill the void of tedium in their daily existence. Then along 
comes an eccentric like Scott, and hollow lives become suddenly transformed, 
even for a nominal fee. 
</P>
<P>
 But nominal fees can add up to millions of dollars, because opportunists like 
Scott provide inspiration, entertainment and insight, however unorthodox or 
trivial, for their adoring fans and followers. Like many of his contemporaries, 
he is aware that there are millions of Frank Andersons and Wes Parkers who will 
support his views and ante up the price to do so. 
</P>
<P>
 For Scott and his fellow performers, this is truly the land of opportunity. 
</P>

<P>
 Every month, our small business donates money, sometimes money we can't 
afford, to three charitable organizations that help save children dying as a 
result of poverty, apathy and terminal diseases. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps after Scott pays for his horses, mansions and security forces, he 
helps people in dire need. But until he discloses to the general public where 
his million-dollar donations go, I wouldn't trust him farther than I could 
throw one of his horses. 
</P>
<P>
 And lest he forget, it was Jesus who threw the money changers out of the 
temple.

 Bunting insinuates that there is something wrong with: 
</P>
<P>
 -- A Christian believing in the Resurrection. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A son showing gratitude to a hospital staff that has consistently extended 
itself in providing care for his parents. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A pastor being successful in taking a church out of debt. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Expecting a politician to keep his or her word. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Behaving in a papal manner -- that is, determining to whom he will or won't 
grant an audience, or living a luxurious lifestyle. 
</P>
<P>
 Your article exercised your right to free speech. But please allow those who 
believe that they have been called by God to support the Scott ministry to 
exercise their constitutional right of free religious expression.

 The identifying mark of all Christians should be love. Scott, as a Christian 
minister, should be rated by his adherence, or lack of it, to God's standard of 
love. 
</P>
<P>
 Truth should not be a casualty of love. 
</P>
<P>
 KAREN J. CHAPMAN 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 An ingredient is missing from Scott's empire that is the whole sum of Christ's 
purpose, and that is love. Is it love to ignore your followers on a personal 
level? Is it love to use profanity? Is violence love? Jesus himself was said to 
have fits of anger but always in the context of a spiritual lesson. 
</P>
<P>
 Giving large sums of money to charities "for the community good" does not make 
one more loving or closer to God. 
</P>
<P>
 If the true purpose of a televangelist is to share the gospel and glorify 
Jesus Christ, but the messenger wallows in a self-made, egotistical 
manipulation machine, we should be warned. It is the exposing of yet another 
Pharisee.

 Here's a Bible lesson you won't hear Scott preach: Jesus resorted to violence 
only once. He directed his wrath toward those who made profit from religion.

<P>
 With all the problems in Los Angeles -- crime, illegal aliens and racial 
tensions -- you choose to print a story on Gene Scott. What you don't like is 
that Scott will not humble himself to you or submit himself to you for 
approval. 
</P>
<P>
 If his church makes him as rich as the Catholic Church or the Mormons, who 
cares? 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 The bottom line on Scott's method of teaching is that it may not be suitable 
for everyone, and that's OK. But at least what you see is always what you get. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 To allow Scott to quote Reinhold Neibuhr in a narrow, out-of-context phrase 
and give the false impression that somehow Scott deserves to be associated with 
a man of Neibuhr's stature is despicable. 
</P>
<P>
 Neibuhr was an intellectual giant, a Christian who applied his Christianity to 
his social conscience and developed a philosophy that transcends religion, one 
that this pagan/agnostic can, and does, easily embrace. Scott is not worthy of 
comparison to Neibuhr.

 When I buy new jeans, I enjoy that my wardrobe has been improved. I don't 
dwell on how the chairman of the Gap uses my money for his yacht payment. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who give to a church should do so as an investment based on quality 
teaching and fellowship with others who believe as they do. If the quality 
decreases, they are free to invest elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 At least give University Cathedral's members credit for being smart enough to 
know that.

 "The reason that the fascination in the man will live is that he was such an 
enigma," says David Frost of Richard Nixon. "He was such a complex character 
that he has this dramatic interest that few other Presidents have ever had, 
being the the only President to be thrown out of office." 
</P>
<P>
 Seventeen years ago, Frost interviewed the former President in five landmark 
90-minute shows that became the most-watched news programming to that date. For 
the first time since 1977, the interviews are being telecast in their entirety 
this month on the Disney Channel. "The Nixon Interviews With David Frost: 1994 
Special Edition" features new introductions by Frost as well as footage of 
Nixon never broadcast before. 
</P>
<P>
 Frost is thrilled that Disney allowed him to add footage he originally cut 
because of time constraints. "It's been fascinating looking at (the new 
footage)," Frost says. "It falls into various categories. There are things like 
him saying where he thinks China will be in 20 years' time and just additional 
insights into the subjects we covered." 
</P>
<P>
 Frost's interviews with Nixon were conducted over a 12-day taping period that 
lasted 28 hours. Nixon had no knowledge of the questions and no control over 
the interviews. "The reason the interviews eventually had the impact they did 
was that everyone predicted the whole project was impossible, that you would 
never force Nixon to say anything he didn't want to say," Frost says. "I put in 
the contract that he would not know any questions in advance nor would he see 
any of the edited programs. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was also made clear that when the cameras rolled, whatever happened, I was 
entitled to broadcast. That was a vital point because if he just refused to 
answer and was totally obstructive in a sense, he would have looked absurd 
doing that." 
</P>
<P>
 The early sessions were slow going. "He did go all the way around the houses 
in terms of trying to answer the questions," Frost explains. "This was not an 
attempt to derail the project, but an attempt, I think, to get things on his 
terms. The other thing, nobody else who had been negotiating with him, like NBC 
News, had insisted that he do at least a quarter of the time on Watergate 
because, believe me, he wasn't volunteering things. He wouldn't have done 
Watergate at all if he didn't have to." 
</P>
<P>
 Frost was roundly criticized when the interviews were first announced in 1975 
because Nixon was paid a reported $650,000 for the rights to his story. 
</P>
<P>
 "After I announced it, people said, 'Is this checkbook journalism?' During the 
time between when we announced it and we did it, I would routinely have to make 
the point that Nixon had already been paid four times as much for his book 
memoirs, where there was no check on him and what he said, as opposed to being 
paid 25% (less) for his television memoirs, which arguably would be more 
honest." 
</P>
<P>
 All arguments about Nixon receiving money, Frost says, "stopped dead when 
everybody saw that the Watergate program took Nixon so much further down the 
line of mea culpa than any of us could have hoped." 
</P>
<P>
 "The Nixon Interviews with David Frost" air Tuesdays at 9 p.m. through August 
on the Disney Channel.

 THE DEVIL'S OWN WORK by Alan Judd. (Knopf: $17; 113 pp.) Literature, muses and 
the nature of creativity are the subjects of "The Devil's Own Work," a slim 
novel by Alan Judd that is more fable than flesh-and-blood fiction. 
</P>
<P>
 Strange things happen during an interview between talented young writer, 
Edward, and O. M. Tyrrel, a world famous literary figure. Tyrrel behaves oddly, 
hinting that his work comes from a mysterious force. He tells Edward, "It took 
a long time to accept that that is really my only choice, listening to the pen. 
I used to do anything I could to drown it but nothing ever worked. I had to 
surrender myself to it." An ancient manuscript changes hands. Tyrrel suddenly 
dies. Shortly afterward, Edward, now in possession of the manuscript, begins to 
achieve literary success beyond his wildest dreams. Tyrrel's mistress, a 
beautiful, ageless woman moves in with him. The book is narrated by Edward's 
guileless friend, a teacher, who witnesses his sudden rise to fame and 
subsequent misery. 
</P>
<P>
 Judd writes in long sentences filled with intelligence and complexity, yet the 
book itself -- the plot and characters -- are almost overly simple. This is a 
cautionary tale, but the act it cautions against, selling your soul, hardly 
seems to be news. Although "The Devil's Own Work" is enjoyable in an ordinary, 
methodical sort of way, at 113 pages it might have benefited from a companion 
piece, perhaps a completely different literary approach to demons, which might 
have added another facet to a somewhat limited work.

 ARISE AND WALK by Barry Gifford. (Hyperion: $19.95; 156 pp.) Generally, people 
don't need to be told how to read fiction.Most novels have one of two main 
characters who walk us through a recognizable plot that roughly corresponds 
with the physical world. Then there are those books that repeatedly work 
against all conventions, even their own, until one may wish for an instruction 
manual explaining how the work is supposed to be read. "Arise and Walk," by 
Barry Gifford is such a book. 
</P>
<P>
 Set in New Orleans, "Arise and Walk" chronicles the lives of various crazed 
and seedy individuals. There's disgraced pastor Cleon Tone, whose destiny is 
entwined with Prisciencia Espanto, a televangelist and prophetess. Two other 
characters, escaped cons Ice D and Spit, are planning to assassinate Klarence 
Krotz, a right wing fanatic running for governor who has a secret erotic 
relationship with Bulgarian sardine czar, Zvatiff Thziz-Tszili. And the list 
goes on. The distressing thing about this teeming mass of humanity is not that 
they are unsympathetic -- though that is also true -- but that Gifford kills 
his main characters off and introduces new ones so many times that it is 
impossible to have an emotional investment. 
</P>
<P>
 With this limitation, it doesn't become clear how to read "Arise And Walk" 
until the book is almost finished. This novel isn't really concerned with 
people so much as with a single emotion, vengeance. It is, in fact, a mural of 
vengeance where each character comes on stage, makes a quick point and then 
dies surrendering to the larger picture. It is a very interesting idea, deftly 
handled. One may wish, however, that Gifford had somehow given just a few more 
clues a little earlier.

 ACTS OF LOVE by Emily Listfield. (Viking: $20.95; 374 pp.) The way you feel 
about a novel a few days after you've finished it, is, in many ways, just as 
important as the experience of reading.Some books leave a bad taste that grows 
over time, while others just get better and better the more you think about 
them. Emily Listfield's fourth novel, "Acts of Love," falls squarely into the 
second category. 
</P>
<P>
 Set in upstate New York, the story coalesces around a single tragic event that 
forever changes the lives of every character. Ted Waring and his wife, Ann, 
have separated after many years of marriage. Their two young daughters -- 
angry, morose Julia and Ali, who is always eager to please -- go on a hunting 
trip with Ted, during which he confides how desperately he hopes to reconcile 
with Ann. Dropping the kids off at the end of the weekend, Ted and Ann have a 
fight. Ted's gun fires. Ann is dead. Julia, who was in the room, claims her 
father purposely killed her mother, but Ted insists that Julia lunged at him, 
making the gun fire. 
</P>
<P>
 Exactly what happened in the seconds before Ann's death is only one of the 
many questions that drives this oddly beautiful, compelling novel. Every 
character has a secret. Every secret causes great pain. Great pain and betrayal 
are, in a way, just as responsible for Ann's death as the actual gun. Listfield 
is brilliant at knowing exactly when to hold back and when to let go of 
information. She changes viewpoints at wonderfully unpredictable moments, 
sometimes in the middle of a scene. Her characters, even the ones who do 
terrible things, are deeply sympathetic. It's impossible not to instantly 
recognize and care for these flawed people. They are us.

 GARDENING IN CLAY: Reflections on AIDS by Ronald O. Valdiserri. (Cornell 
University Press: $18; 107 pp.) "Illness is the result of many different 
elements -- natural phenomena, social influences, individual behavior -- acting 
together synergistically.HIV is often the end result of a long chain of events, 
some of which . . . may appear trivial or even unrelated to the eventual 
outcome." So writes Ronald Valdiserri in "Gardening in Clay," a collection of 
essays about HIV that has, as one of its central points, the idea that AIDS can 
be blamed, at least partly, on society. 
</P>
<P>
 Valdiserri, a physician who lost his twin brother to the disease, has a 
starched, methodical style that effectively communicates information but falls 
short in the realm of feeling. This is too bad since the most original and 
thought-provoking essays, by far, are the few where Valdiserri is able to 
really give of his private self. There is a moving description of his friend 
Martin who didn't tell anyone he had the disease, and the title piece -- 
Valdiserri's humble account of trying to create a garden with inferior soil, is 
a true stunner. 
</P>
<P>
 Whose fault is AIDS? What should be done in terms of prevention and education? 
"Gardening in Clay" honestly addresses these questions, and more, but in spite 
of numerous anecdotes and commentaries, many readers may come away feeling some 
connection was missed in this sad, enigmatic book.

 FAMILY TERRORISTS by Antonya Nelson (Houghton Mifflin: $19.95; 269 pp.). 
Webster's dictionary defines a terrorist as someone who "uses force or threats 
to demoralize, intimidate and subjugate," but that doesn't even come close to 
describing the infinitely subtle variations on the word that Antonya Nelson 
creates in her newest collection of stories, "Family Terrorists." 
</P>
<P>
 There are lies so old and layered, so non-verbal, that they have become 
hopelessly woven into the fabric of the families appearing here. The things 
these characters tell or don't tell each other, the way they deal with pain, 
and what they do in an emergency, is all a kind of personal terrorism no 
dictionary can encompass. Antonya Nelson gives the word more power in every 
story. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, the title piece, a novella, isn't as successful. Its premise -- 
four grown siblings coming together for their parents' wedding (they are 
getting remarried after a divorce) -- is full of potential, but the story never 
really gathers sufficient momentum. This is partly due to too many active 
characters, both people and dogs. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the stories, some are fine, some are great, and one, "Naked Ladies," is 
truly masterful. Nelson has a talent for finding a detail, then capping it with 
an unusual yet perfect observation. Here is a description from "The Written 
Word," another wonderful story: "Ben was gnawing his left hand, something he'd 
started doing just a couple of weeks before, when school began. He claimed it 
itched and only his teeth helped . . . His classmates called him Mandible. 
Already he was weird, and he had so many years of school left to go." Antonya 
Nelson is a growing, vibrant writer. It will be a pleasure seeing what she does 
next.

 In the 1990 Ernest Goes to Jail (NBC Sunday at 9 p.m.), Jim Varney's Ernest P. 
Worrell, that demented motor mouth, gets in trouble because of his resemblance 
to a look-alike deranged prison kingpin (also played by Varney). 
</P>
<P>
 Steven Spielberg's interminable 1989 Always (ABC Sunday at 9 p.m.) is an 
ill-advised remake of the 1943 "A Guy Named Joe." Richard Dreyfuss plays a 
flying ace who's killed but allowed by an angel (Audrey Hepburn) to come back 
to help a new pilot (Brad Johnson) become the hotshot he had been. Starring 
Holly Hunter as the pilots' shared love interest. 
</P>
<P>
 A teen-age girl's need for a bone marrow transplant and her mother's refusal 
to allow a younger brother to be a donor hurtles a family to the brink of 
destruction in the worthy 1992 Desperate Choices: To Save My Child (NBC Monday 
at 9 p.m.), which stars Reese Witherspoon, Bruce Davison and Joanna Kerns. 
</P>
<P>
 In Allie Light's warm and encouraging Dialogues With Madwomen (KCET Tuesday at 
10 p.m.), seven highly articulate women tell us their stories of enduring and 
eventually overcoming mental illness. 
</P>
<P>
 KCET is airing Wednesday at 7:30 p.m. Michael Wadleigh's Woodstock in the 
shorter, original release version (3 hours, 4 minutes). The landmark 
documentary-concert film is also available in a 4 1/2-hour version. 
</P>
<P>
 Although not without flaws, Blake Edwards' 1991 comedy Switch (KCOP Thursday 
at 8 p.m., Saturday at 6 p.m.) has a modern sense of confusion about sexual 
roles and social masks. The film tries to find a sense of responsibility -- or 
empathy or humanism -- in the midst of sexual chaos. Murdered by three 
infuriated mistresses, a callous, high-rolling New York ad executive (Perry 
King) is sent back to Earth as a woman (Ellen Barkin, whose scenes crackle with 
danger) to somehow redeem him/herself. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1987 Hamburger Hill (KCOP Friday at 8 p.m.) pays heartfelt, richly 
deserved tribute to one of the Vietnam War's bloodiest battles. However, it 
lapses into a preachy attack on the anti-war movement without ever questioning 
U.S. involvement in the war in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1980 Frank Sinatra ended a near-decade absence from the screen with The 
First Deadly Sin (KCOP Saturday at 8 p.m.), in which he played, with a fresh 
charge of passion and commitment. He plays a New York homicide detective with 
an adored, dying wife (Faye Dunaway) and who is on the verge of retirement when 
a maniac goes on a lethal rampage. This is solid, absorbing fare -- until its 
disturbing vigilante finish. 
</P>
<P>
 Annette O'Toole and Anthony Andrews star in Jewels, a two-part 1992 miniseries 
(NBC Friday at 8 p.m. and Saturday at 9 p.m.) based on a Danielle Steel story. 
The saga here covers four decades in the life of an American socialite and the 
English royal family into which she marries.

SERIES WRITING FENCED OUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 From the Emmy nominations announced last week, the television academy sent out 
a message that there was not one other quality drama series in a whole season 
that deserved recognition for writing other than "NYPD Blue" (ABC). If such is 
the case, that does not bode well for the future of commercial television. 
</P>
<P>
 Congratulations to the producers, writers, cast and crew of "NYPD Blue" on 
their record 26 Emmy nominations. I watched every week and I applaud their 
efforts. However, in terms of writing, there is a far more deserving drama 
series that was sorely overlooked by the academy -- "Picket Fences" (CBS). 
</P>
<P>
 Why isn't anyone (the media) crying foul? Where is the Writers Guild of 
America and the representatives of the talented scripters who crafted the fine 
dramas this season such as "Northern Exposure," "Homicide" and "Picket Fences"? 
</P>
<P>
 If I were them, I'd picket the Emmys.

THE MOST SUITABLE COURSE: PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Patt Morrison's "A Pastime Named Sue" (On the Town, July 10) supports my 
contention that, rather than blaming the lawyers for all that ails society, one 
should really take a long look at the clients, people like those helpful souls 
who advised Morrison to sue everyone who caused her plight. 
</P>
<P>
 I realize that some of her advisers were attorneys, as am I. Someone who 
stands to gain from the actions of another will often give such ill-advised 
counsel.But mostly, her experience mirrors our national malaise: "I am not 
responsible for what happens to me." 
</P>
<P>
 Not every wrong has a perpetrator. Not every problem is someone's fault. 
Compared to other Western nations, we have become a nation of crybabies. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether one's motivation is psychologically based (to deny one's own 
responsibility), is founded on greed (to get rich at "no one's" expense) or to 
be part of the crowd ("everybody else does it"), the true productivity of 
America will not be realized until we all become accountable for our own 
actions.

that only women who are beanpoles are attractive.

 Look at how rich and glorious these women are! Let's have more of this!

SHOWS FOR YOUNGSTERS AND THEIR PARENTS TOO; HBO'S 'CRISIS' STORY OF LIFE IN A

 Eddie Matos remembers his last dance well. 
</P>
<P>
 Only days after a spin with his girlfriend, he was shot in the back by a rival 
drug dealer, paralyzing him from the neck down. He was 16. 
</P>
<P>
 Matos' story, of a teen-ager who began selling drugs at 13, is the subject of 
this month's Lifestories: Families in Crisis, P.O.W.E.R.: The Eddie Matos 
Story. 
</P>
<P>
 From his room at the Goldwater Memorial Hospital on Roosevelt Island in New 
York, Matos, who must breathe from a respirator and talk on the phone through a 
remote he operates with his teeth, discussed with a reporter his experience and 
HBO's version of it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm hoping kids will see the show, and ... realize what happens," he says. 
"This is my story and this is what happened to me when I got involved with guns 
and drugs." 
</P>
<P>
 Matos had a difficult inner-city childhood, as did most of the other 150 kids 
in his ward paralyzed as a result of violence. 
</P>
<P>
 When he was an infant, his father left for Puerto Rico, leaving the boy with a 
mother facing her own demons. Alcoholism and drug addiction led her to 
prostitution and, finally, death; she was found with her throat slashed. Matos, 
then 13, had to identify the body. 
</P>
<P>
 Shuffled around between family and friends, his last real home was with his 
mother's best friend, who asked Matos to leave when he got involved in selling 
drugs. Despite encouragement from teachers who found him bright and promising, 
Matos succumbed to the get-rich-quick lifestyle of drug-dealing. His $1,500 a 
week was what it was all about, he says. "Everything then was about money. 
That's it." 
</P>
<P>
 Then he was shot. Pronounced dead at the scene of the shooting, Matos was kept 
alive by paramedics and awoke a quadriplegic. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wrote a letter to the mayor (of New York) telling him about some kids who 
were killed at my high school," he begins. "And from that letter I appeared on 
the MacNeil/Lehrer show (on PBS) and then started the P.O.W.E.R (People Opening 
the World's Eyes to Reality) group." Matos and others like him began to speak 
in schools against guns and drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you see them talk at schools you can see the huge impact they have. They 
arrive in a minivan, all in their wheelchairs with respirators," says producer 
Howard Meltzer. "They can really only talk to kids within their vicinity, but 
with this show they're hoping for a larger audience. There's a plan for tapes 
to be made for schools and community organizations." 
</P>
<P>
 Matos, him who appears at the end of the program, delivers a similar message 
to the one he gives in school: "Drugs made me a big man on the streets of East 
New York. I had cars. I had respect. I had power. But that power was an 
illusion. That wasn't real. This is real: This chair, this respirator, these 
arms and legs that don't move any more . . . That's real. And it didn't have to 
be this way. I made a bad situation worse by the choices I made . . . You're 
responsible for your life. ... Don't do drugs and don't do guns." 
</P>
<P>
 Matos knows his story has tremendous impact. "But you know what got them?" he 
says, referring to the public reaction to his MacNeil/Lehrer appearance. "They 
showed me dancing. Like right before I was shot, there was a video of my 
girlfriend and me, just twirling around. Then they showed how I am now." 
</P>
<P>
 As with any film biography, there may be some discrepancies with reality. 
Matos was disappointed in the way his character (played by Alexis Cruz) talked. 
"He uses a lot of profanity," he says. "I mean, I swore and stuff, but not as 
much as they used." 
</P>
<P>
 Matos would have liked to have spent time with Cruz, "to get him familiar with 
me." A planned meeting didn't work out. Still, he says, "most of the movie is 
me." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Matos is ready to leave the rehabilitation hospital, where he's 
lived for four years, and find a new home. "I just don't want to go home just 
anywhere. I guess I may be choosy. But I really want to find a home." 
</P>
<P>
 "Lifestories: Families in Crisis, P.O.W.E.R.: The Eddie Matos Story" premieres 
Tuesday at 10 p.m. on HBO and repeats throughout the month. For ages 10 and up.

A LEADERSHIP STUDY WITHOUT FOLLOWERS; CERTAIN TRUMPETS: THE CALL OF LEADERS, BY 
GARRY WILLS (SIMON & SCHUSTER: $23; 304 PP.)  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Derek Shearer, Derek Shearer is professor of Public Policy at Occidental 
College and Director of the International & Public Affairs Center.

<TEXT>
<P>
 In the post-Cold War era, when old certainties have fled and ideologies and 
governments have crumbled -- and global economic forces undermine the stability 
of daily life -- there seems to be a hunger for leadership. Although often 
cynical about leaders, especially politicians, many Americans appear to want 
strong men and women to provide a way forward in confused and troubling times. 
Witness the appeal of independent presidential candidate Ross Perot, the rise 
of the Christian Right or new Black Nationalist leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 But don't we already have plenty of leaders? After all, societies have 
individuals who occupy the top spots in government, in business enterprises, in 
social organizations or in hereditary bodies like a kingdom or a tribe -- but 
does simply being in a position of authority make a person a leader? People 
expect a leader to lead, not simply enjoy the perks of high office and the 
trappings of power. This is especially true in times of change. In democratic 
societies and in most post-industrial organizations, except perhaps the 
military, a leader cannot simply issue orders and expect to be obeyed. A leader 
must persuade as well as command. 
</P>
<P>
 What, then, is leadership? Are there different kinds? Where do leaders come 
from? Are they born -- "a natural leader" -- or forged by circumstance -- or 
"in the right place at the right time?" Can we identify leadership traits that 
one might cultivate or learn? And, has modern technology, especially 
television, transformed telegenic celebrities into leaders and pushed aside 
others? 
</P>
<P>
 These are some of the questions that come to mind when considering a book 
about leaders by the distinguished scholar Gary Wills, professor of Humanities 
at Northwestern University, who has previously written insightful books on such 
American political leaders as Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan, Jack Kennedy, 
George Washington and Abraham Lincoln. 
</P>
<P>
 In his introduction, Wills makes the important, if obvious point, that a 
leader needs followers and is defined, in part, by them. Wills offers this 
definition: "The leader is one who mobilizes others toward a goal shared by 
leader and followers. . . . Leaders, followers, and goals make up the three 
necessary supports for leadership." 
</P>
<P>
 Wills goes on to say that a "leader whose qualities do not match those of 
potential followers is simply irrelevant." Wills considers real leadership to 
involve an interactive relationship between leaders and followers, not simply 
the issue of orders. "Leadership is always a struggle," he writes, implying 
that it isn't easy, and that real leaders are rare and that strong, active 
leadership is hard to find. 
</P>
<P>
 Wills then proceeds to examine leadership by presenting 16 types of leaders 
through mini-profiles, ranging from elected to military charismatic to saintly, 
and including sports, business and church. In each category, Wills presents an 
ideal-type and an anti-type -- the latter a noted person who failed as a 
leader. As in any typology, Wills' categories are arbitrary. Not surprisingly, 
Wills finds that President Franklin Roosevelt was a successful leader, and the 
anti-type Adlai Stevenson was a failure. But too simplistically, Wills 
attributes the difference to the fact that FDR had to triumph over personal 
adversity -- his polio -- which made him a stronger person with more empathy 
for followers, while Stevenson coasted through life without having to overcome 
such a challenge. Wills discounts the role of history and circumstance -- 
namely, that FDR came to power in the Depression when many grass-roots social 
movements were demanding action from the federal government, while Stevenson 
practiced politics in the more conservative '50s and never won national power. 
</P>
<P>
 One can always disagree about lists -- who should be included and who 
shouldn't -- especially about important people -- and one can disagree about 
categories. The problem that I have with Wills' book is that both his list of 
leaders and his typology seem both too broad brushed and rigid to be either 
very interesting or very informative. A book that includes profiles of such 
diverse and historically disparate people as King David, Ross Perot, Madonna 
and Carl Stotz (the founder of Little League) runs the risk of trivializing 
leadership -- or at the very least, of making it less complicated than it is. 
The historical circumstances under which individuals become leaders is 
short-changed -- and the further back Wills goes in time, the less relevant is 
his work to the present day. I did not find his discussion of charismatic 
leaders utilizing King David and Solomon as his examples very enlightening. I 
would have preferred that Wills use his skills of critical analysis to present 
Jesse Jackson or Louis Farrakhan or Pat Robertson and an examination of how 
they interacted with their followers. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of his examples are inappropriate, if not incorrect. In discussing 
diplomatic leadership, Wills uses Andrew Young as his type and discusses his 
role in the Civil Rights movement as Dr. King's negotiator. Young was really 
more of a staffer who carried out King's many-pronged strategy than a 
diplomatic leader in his own right. Even as U.N. ambassador, Young was not a 
major diplomatic leader, not did he ever really have his own following. George 
Kennan, Dean Acheson or Henry Kissinger, to name a few, would have been more 
appropriate choices. 
</P>
<P>
 Wills treats Martin Luther King Jr. as an archetype rhetorical leader, which 
badly understates King's political achievements. In order to fit King into one 
of the narrow boxes of his typology, Wills misses much of importance. King was 
one of the greatest political leaders of a mass citizens' movement in U.S. 
history -- and a critical analysis of his leadership would be well worth 
reading, but what Wills provides is narrow and disappointing. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, it isn't entirely fair to take an author to task for having written 
a different book from what one would like to read -- but as a fan of Gary 
Wills, I wish that he had focused on fewer leaders and selected ones who have 
risen to leadership in the media age -- people like Vaclav Havel, Lech Walesa, 
Gorbachev, Yeltsin, Nixon, Reagan, Cesar Chavez, Saul Alinksy, Ralph Nader, 
Betty Freidan and Mother Teresa -- to name a few -- and analyzed the sources 
and means of their leadership, as well as their social and political context 
and, in particular, how they provided goals and vision to followers and led 
movements or organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 For readers seeking a scholarly book on leadership, James MacGregor Burns' 
Pulitzer Prize winner, "Leadership," is still the classic. For profiles of 
modern leaders in a variety of fields, I recommend "Makers of the Modern World" 
by Louis Untermeyer. These two books together cover the ground trod by Wills, 
and do it more coherently and in greater depth than "Certain Trumpets." 
</P>
<P>
 What is still needed is a book on leadership in the post-industrial, high 
tech, media-driven era we live in. Unfortunately, Wills did not provide such a 
book.

ON THE TOWN: A DOG'S LIFE; WHEN YOU RESIDE IN THE CITY, KEEPING A CANINE MEANS 
LIVING ON A SHORT LEASH

 My friend George is a composer of no small talent, well read in philosophy and 
the arts, a toiler in the hip new world of inter-media. He plays in a million 
bands, mostly one-off things, though the one he led a decade ago is still 
revered in certain circles, and he has written computer-based music for both 
avant-garde dance performances and for Calvin Klein. He is the man you want on 
your side in a coffeehouse argument about Bunuel. But mostly George is an owner 
of dogs, a dog owner nearly to the point of homelessness. 
</P>
<P>
 His first dog, Abelard, showed up a couple of years ago, a smart, shaggy thing 
George rescued from the friend of a friend. Gummo came soon afterward, a manic 
terrier with the speed and leaping ability to rocket into your solar plexus 
from a standing start. Gummo and Abelard at once developed a sort of insidious 
teamwork, a talent for cute obnoxiousness. It is amazing how quickly George's 
dogs can reduce a Sunday newspaper into an ankle-high blizzard of lint. 
</P>
<P>
 George doted on his dogs, cooking them garlic-laden dinners and schlepping 
them to the dog park, cutting short appointments in order to play with them 
more. He became a regular reader of all-pooch classified-ad tabloids that read 
like lonely-hearts publications for dogs. He has not had an answering-machine 
message in months that hasn't featured barks or snarls, and I believe if you 
were to show him a fluffy cloud or an ink blot, George would see only 
sharp-snouted Gummo. 
</P>
<P>
 But it's not easy to keep noisy dogs in the city, not if you don't have the 
money for a proper yard anyway. Urban dog owners, denied access to cool, 
rent-controlled apartments and sweetheart roommate deals, compose the basic 
rental market for remote hillside shacks leased complete with rusting Buicks. 
Hordes of apartment owners refuse to rent to you, letters are sent to the 
health department, nuisance complaints are phoned in to the cops. People why 
try to be responsible dog owners end up being controlled by their pets. 
</P>
<P>
 George was able to keep the first place for a few years, a little Hollywood 
bungalow, mostly because his nearest neighbor was hard of hearing and a 
good-natured fellow, but an unfriendly guy moved in next door and George's luck 
ran out. 
</P>
<P>
 George tried all the usual inducements to get his dogs to stop barking, and a 
few of the weirder ones as well: homeopathic flower oils designed to get Gummo 
and Abelard in touch with their inner puppies, tinctures of camomile, even more 
elaborate home-cooked dinners. Someone suggested barbaric vocal chord surgery: 
out of the question. A veterinarian recommended a special collar that would 
give Gummo a mild shock when he barked, but George thought it was cruel and the 
pain potentially more confusing than instructive. 
</P>
<P>
 The dogs do seem to calm down a bit when George leaves them alone with MTV on, 
which may answer the question of who the target audience for Counting Crows 
videos might be, but doesn't really appease the neighbors. George was set to 
vacate the first bungalow, but after a lengthy search was suddenly dis-invited 
by the owner of the potential second home. 
</P>
<P>
 He was accepted at a third, but the neighborhood's idea of a dog seemed to be 
more that of an animate stuffed animal than an actual biological entity -- 
there were even petitions circulated by anti-canine vigilantes -- and George 
was kicked out of the bungalow before he had a chance to unpack his boxes of 
stuff. The dogs are temporarily living at a friend's house and George with his 
girlfriend, but it feels like a sad Simon Legree tale, a tragically broken 
home.

ESCAPE ROUTES; DARKNESS MOVES: AN HENRI MICHAUX ANTHOLOGY, 1927-1984, SELECTED 
AND TRANSLATED FROM THE SPANISH BY DAVID BALL (UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA PRESS: 
$30; 270 PP.)

<P>
 In some literary and artistic circles the name Henri Michaux is synonymous 
with the verb to explore. Poet, painter and traveler, Michaux was one of this 
century's most vital spiritual adventurers. Born in Namur, Belgium, in 1899, 
until his death in Paris in 1984 he spent his long and productive career 
working against prevailing notions of reality. "I write so that what was true 
should no longer be true," he declared. "Prison revealed is a prison no 
longer." His are detailed instructions for those seeking escape from the 
prisons of the self and society. 
</P>
<P>
 The German occupation of Belgium during World War I spurred Michaux's lifelong 
restlessness. In 1920, having abandoned his medical studies, he took to sea, 
sailing to Rio de Janeiro and Buenos Aires -- employment he soon gave up when, 
as he writes, "(t)he big window close(d) once again." Back in Brussels, 
disgusted with everything, he read Lautreamont's "Chants de Maldoror," which 
reminded him of his "long-forgotten need to write." A move to Paris, contact 
with the Surrealists (who would try, in vain, to claim him as one of their 
own), journeys to Latin America and Asia, all contributed to the development of 
his strange genius. 
</P>
<P>
 He wrote two unconventional travel books -- "Ecuador" and "A Barbarian in 
Asia" -- based on real experience, as well as many works devoted to invented 
places. An anthropologist of the absurd, he took careful notes. Here is an 
excerpt from his itinerary: 
</P>
<P>
 Surrounding the Land of Magic, tiny little islands: buoys. In each buoy a dead 
person. This ring of buoys protects the Land of Magic, acts as an alarm for the 
inhabitants of the country, tells them when foreigners are coming. 
</P>
<P>
 Then all they have to do is send them on the wrong course and far away. 
</P>
<P>
 Michaux said that his imaginary countries functioned as "buffer-states for me, 
so as not to suffer from reality. While traveling," he explained, "when almost 
everything jars me, they're the ones that take the shocks, and then I can see 
what's funny about them, and have a good time." Thus he created the Lands of 
the Emanglons, Hivinizikis and Meidosems, the last of whom will not leave the 
concentration camps in which they live. Although they are beaten and tortured, 
"(t)hey are afraid that outside, they would get bored." In short, Michaux 
explored a universe parallel to ours, probing the fissures and crevices in time 
and reason "in order to arrive: where?" Octavio Paz writes. "At the nowhere 
that is here, there, and everywhere." 
</P>
<P>
 Such a quest could not be confined to verse -- much of his best work is in 
prose -- nor even to the word: Michaux's drawings and paintings have been 
exhibited around the world. He is the true heir to that visionary poet-painter, 
William Blake. It is, indeed, as if Michaux journeyed through Ulro, Blake's 
symbolic realm in which mankind dwells, crippled by reason. There he found 
monsters -- "A Certain Plume," a man sexually ravaged by a caterpillar, and one 
who "went for a kiss (and) brought back a head. Pray for him," Michaux advises, 
"he rages for you." 
</P>
<P>
 After his wife died in a tragic accident in 1948, Michaux adopted a different 
mode of travel: "Mescaline is the thing explored," he wrote in the preface to 
the first of four books on the subject, "Miserable Miracle," "Turbulent 
Infinity," "Knowledge Through the Abyss," and "The Great Oracle of the Mind," 
each of which is represented here. "Mescaline 'unmasks,' " Michaux says, "with 
terror, but exaltation too," explains his translator, David Ball. These texts 
are at once unnerving and exhilarating: 
</P>
<P>
 "I was sailing in a sort of nausea that had become a delight, swaying under 
the far-off, moving stars, which sometimes seemed like the lights of ships you 
see at night pitching and rolling on rough seas, but here, lights of galactic 
ships navigating the ocean of boundlessness. This ocean was in all directions; 
it alone mattered." 
</P>
<P>
 With "Darkness Moves" David Ball has made a signal contribution to our 
understanding of Henri Michaux. This is a large collection of his work, 
including poetry and prose, his cryptic autobiography and a range of critical 
reflections; the reproduction of 30 prints illustrates Michaux's success at 
charting that mysterious terrain where the figure becomes a line emerging 
directly from the unknown. Ball's introduction and headnotes are illuminating, 
his translations adequate: it is a shame this book was not published in a 
bilingual edition. Inexplicably, Michaux's famous "I Am Writing to You From a 
Far-Off Country" is missing from these pages, and readers may wonder why there 
is no formal bibliography. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, "Darkness Moves" is an important addition to our literature. The 
historian and novelist John Ralston Saul suggests that we have come to the end 
of the 20th Century trapped "in the hands of blind reason." Henri Michaux's 
monsters and magic tear those hands from our faces, our masks. One of his 
aphorisms reads: "He who leaves a trace, leaves a wound." Michaux's wounds are 
maps.

CHILDREN'S BOOKSHELF: NEXT COMES THE AUTHOR TOUR; SOME KIDS EXPRESS THEIR 
INTEREST IN BOOKS BY WANTING TO WRITE THEM -- AND WHY NOT? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL HARRIS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 I wrote my first book when I was 6. It had four pages. It was about my dog 
(half Irish setter, half Chesapeake Bay retriever). I illustrated it with 
drawings of her wearing a queenly crown above her long, drooping ears. 
</P>
<P>
 It was fun, I remember, and I might have written more books then if the end 
product, even to a first-grader, hadn't looked so amateurish. My book was 
scrawled in pencil on sheets of butcher paper and either stuck together with 
Scotch tape or tied with yarn. I forget which. 
</P>
<P>
 History, or biology, repeats itself. Last year, also at 6, my son, George, 
began to write books. More imaginative than the old man, he described the 
adventures of a lizard named Pizard ("He's green. He's cool.") who backpacks, 
plays golf, parties at the drop of a holiday with other lizards, travels to 
China in search of a stolen watch and is kidnaped by "bad space aliens" and 
taken to Mars. 
</P>
<P>
 For his illustrations, George had plenty of crayons, colored pencils and 
markers, but otherwise nothing much had changed. 
</P>
<P>
 He wrote the text by hand, in straggling lines. 
</P>
<P>
 The binding was still Scotch tape. 
</P>
<P>
 Though he hadn't yet heard of Marshall McLuhan, George seemed aware that such 
a flimsy medium at least compromised his message -- made it "kid stuff" in 
comparison, say, to a professionally typeset, hardcover Dr. Seuss. 
</P>
<P>
 This probably wouldn't have stopped him. George is a determined boy, and 
Pizard, bless his reptilian heart, kept finding new scrapes to get into. But 
any danger that my son might grow prematurely discouraged about writing was 
forestalled by the high-tech, low-cost wonders of computers and by his 
first-grade teacher at Westerly School of Long Beach, Tom Aplin. 
</P>
<P>
 Under Aplin's guidance, George and his classmates wrote rough drafts of 
stories, edited them, proofread them, printed them on a PC and saw them 
transformed into "real" books with semi-hard covers, endpapers, title and 
dedication pages, even copyrights. 
</P>
<P>
 By the end of the school year, the class had produced a hefty little library. 
George, preferring to keep his Pizard stories extracurricular, contributed "The 
Eagle Who Could Not Fly," "The Frog Who Lost His Voice" and "The Hat on 
Iguana." 
</P>
<P>
 The books look good, and they ought to be durable. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, George keeps writing on his own. At last report, Pizard's 
grandfather has been swallowed by a giant Venus flytrap. He isn't in immediate 
peril -- he has a supply of jelly sandwiches and orange juice in there, George 
tells me -- but Pizard still has to rescue him. How? I guess I'll just have to 
wait and see. 
</P>
<P>
 If your kids want to make books, they can learn how by reading Making a Book 
by Mandy Suhr (Thomson Learning: $15.95; 48 pp.). 
</P>
<P>
 Much like George's teacher, Suhr leads them through the process of 
researching, writing, editing and designing a book. She shows kids how to 
construct neat-looking books using pens, paper, scissors, glue, clear tape, 
paint and thread. As counterpoint, she also describes how publishers and 
printers produce mass-market books. 
</P>
<P>
 Kids can add another dimension of fun by putting pop-ups in their books. In 
How a Book Is Made, Suhr shows how to cut and fold paper to achieve this 
jack-in-the-box effect. How to Make Pop-Ups by Joan Irvine (Morrow, 1994: 
$6.95) provides more detail as well as non-book applications of the technique. 
</P>
<P>
 For those who don't want to dive straight into book writing without dipping 
their toes in it first, there's the venerable My Book About Me by Dr. Seuss and 
Roy McKie (Beginners Books, 1969). Kids are led to fill in blanks, make 
personalized answers to multiple-choice questions and, at the end -- taking a 
deep breath -- write that first story of their own.

SELF PORTRAIT, BY SAMANTHA ABEEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 To show you who I am 
</P>
<P>
 I crawled inside a tree, became its roots, bark and leaves, 
</P>
<P>
 listened to its whispers in the wind. 
</P>
<P>
 When fall came and painted the leaves red and gold 
</P>
<P>
 I wanted to shake them across your lawn 
</P>
<P>
 to transform the grass into a quilt, a gift spread at your 
</P>
<P>
 feet, 
</P>
<P>
 but their numbers eluded me, 
</P>
<P>
 so I turned a piece of paper into my soul 
</P>
<P>
 to send to you so that you might see 
</P>
<P>
 how easily it can be crumpled and flattened out again. 
</P>
<P>
 I wanted you to see my resilience, 
</P>
<P>
 but I wasn't sure how to arrange the numbers in your 
</P>
<P>
 address, 
</P>
<P>
 so I danced with the Indians in the forest 
</P>
<P>
 and collected feathers that fell from the eagle's wings, 
</P>
<P>
 each one a wish for my future, 
</P>
<P>
 but I lost track of their numbers, gathered too many, 
</P>
<P>
 and was unable to carry them home 
</P>
<P>
 so I reaped the wind with my hair, 
</P>
<P>
 relived its journey through my senses, and 
</P>
<P>
 felt its whispered loneliness, like lakes in winter, 
</P>
<P>
 but it was too far and you could not follow me. 
</P>
<P>
 Now I've written out their shadows 
</P>
<P>
 like the wind collects its secrets 
</P>
<P>
 to whisper into receptive ears, and I 
</P>
<P>
 will leave them at your doorstep, 
</P>
<P>
 a reminder of what others cannot see, 
</P>
<P>
 a reminder of what I can and cannot be. 
</P>

POLAR ADVENTURE; THE BIRTHDAY BOYS, BY BERYL BAINBRIDGE (CARROLL & GRAF: 
$18.95; 192 PP.)  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Judith Freeman, Judith Freeman's novel, Set for Life, is currently being 
made into a film for CBS. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "The Birthday Boys," a new novel by the English author Beryl Bainbridge, is an 
imagined account of Capt. Robert Falcon Scott's expedition to the South Pole in 
1912, told in the voices of Scott and four men who followed him to their 
deaths. In each account a birthday is celebrated, or mentioned -- thus the 
title. It's an ironic touch by a novelist noted for her droll humor. A darker, 
more tragic story couldn't be masquerading under a more jovial veneer. 
</P>
<P>
 I read "The Birthday Boys" in one sitting, in a state of complete absorption, 
stunned by its beauty, by the depth of its accomplishment, but perhaps most of 
all by the audacious choice of historical subject matter which Bainbridge has 
appropriated and so flawlessly rendered into fiction. 
</P>
<P>
 The facts of Capt. Scott's adventure are known. His second expedition (the 
first failed) was mounted shortly after hearing that Shackleton, in 1911, had 
been forced to turn back only half a dozen marches short of the South Pole. 
Scott's subsequent race for the prize was thwarted by Amundsen, who set out 
around the same time and beat him to the pole by a matter of days -- some argue 
because Scott had chosen to experiment with motorized vehicles and the 
ill-fated ponies for transport rather than relying on the sled dogs Amundsen 
had favored. 
</P>
<P>
 But these are only the facts, and what seems less explored, and the perfect 
provenance for a novelist, is the deeper story of who these men really were. 
Each had a mother or a wife, a life he left behind, and these relationships are 
so subtly and economically evoked they become as much a part of the story as 
the physical privations that are endured. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a brilliant decision to chose to tell this story from five different 
perspectives, for it allows the complexities and contradictions to emerge. For 
instance, Petty Officer Taff Evans, a working-class Welshman valued for his 
brute strength and mechanical prowess, has a dogged devotion to Scott, who 
treats him with deep respect in spite of their class differences; the 
upper-crust Capt. Oates, sensing Scott's weakness for making mistakes and 
shifting the blame to others, mutters behind his back and offers quite a 
different portrait of their leader. 
</P>
<P>
 The actual march to the pole takes up the smallest portion of the story. It's 
the preparations, the long journey to Antarctica by sea, the months spent 
acclimating, waiting for the weather to break, Scott's mistrust of dogs, the 
motors that fail or are lost, that provide the bulk of the drama. 
</P>
<P>
 The little recollections of the lives they've left behind weight the story 
emotionally. Scott misses his wife, whose absence feels like an "amputation." 
Birdie Bowers, still a virginal young man, swears his mother appears at the 
edge of a crevasse and weeps frozen tears before the apparition. 
</P>
<P>
 To the very end, the men behave with consummate kindness toward each other. 
They seem to increase in humanity as their chances for survival dwindle. "One 
just has to believe that it's within one's spiritual domain to conquer 
difficulties," Scott says. "That is not to say that I don't recognize there has 
to be a time to submit, possibly a time to die, merely that I've never yet been 
taken to the brink." 
</P>
<P>
 But he is soon taken to the brink, and beyond. Weak and starving, dispirited 
beyond words at finding Amundsen's tracks at the pole when they arrive, the men 
turn back, huddle in their tent, their frostbitten flesh red and purple, 
"shining with that same sort of sweet glaze one sees on rotten meat." 
</P>
<P>
 For Scott, who in his ruthlessness of purpose resembled Napoleon, there was no 
such word as impossible, or if there was, as one character says, it was listed 
in a dictionary for fools. Bravery was a conscious act of discipline. "Is it 
true that adversity brings out the best in men?" Dr. Wilson is asked at one 
point. "Yes," is the answer, "good men, that is." 
</P>
<P>
 In a sense, Bainbridge has made all five characters "good men," by simply 
giving them such full and rich human dimensions. "It's to be regretted that the 
best of me, the part that recognizes both the horror and beauty of destiny, 
remains submerged," Scott writes. But it is exactly those submerged parts that 
Bainbridge excavates. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott always claimed that he meant his journey to be as much a scientific 
expedition as a quest for the pole (he derided Amundsen for being interested 
only in glory). In one of the most moving sections of "The Birthday Boys," Lt. 
Bowers, a scientist, leads a small party to retrieve some emperor penguin eggs 
and endures a nightmarish ordeal. Later, musing on the horrors of that 
experience and the affection he feels for his companions, he comments: "It may 
be that the purpose of the worst journey in the world had been to collect eggs 
which might prove a scientific theory, but we'd unraveled a far greater mystery 
on the way -- the missing link between God and man is brotherly love."

PALM LATITUDES: IN EXCESS; THE ULTIMATE FASHION DON'T 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Zuzana Prochazka 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I kept seeing the ads in the local giveaways and I couldn't resist: I called 
and ordered a catalogue. It went to the wrong address, and when my neighbor 
brought it by, I thought I caught a quick wink.On the envelope were a 
heart-shaped padlock with crossed keys and the words, "Chastity, Fashion with a 
Message." 
</P>
<P>
 The message comes from Chastity U.S.A., an L.A. company that sells chastity 
belts designed to be worn over clothing. Enrique Oliver, the man behind the 
belt, considers it a symbol of the renaissance of romance and leisurely 
courting. "Save it for the one you love," says Oliver. 
</P>
<P>
 Chastity offers 15 styles for women and three for men. All have intriguing 
names like Lucy, Daisy, Gigi and Plain Jane, and each is a sturdy combination 
of leather, chains, rivets and padlocks. (Should the key be lost, there's no 
need for emergency roadside service: The belts conveniently unsnap from the 
back.) They come in three sizes, but they don't come cheap -- low end is 
$49.95, high end $69.95. 
</P>
<P>
 I considered what message I would send with "Heather" -- a white belt 
suggested to be perfect as a bridal shower gift -- if I were to be, say, 
wearing it while checking the fat content on a package of Nutter Butters in 
Von's. Would my statement be too strong? Would it be a "conversation 
ice-breaker" as suggested in the Chastity Inc. literature? 
</P>
<P>
 Oliver concedes that sales are slow, but he says his products are a symbolic 
weapon in a war on promiscuity. As he says, "Let's stop, lock it and start the 
cleaning." Zuzana Prochazka

AMERICA, TAKE OFF YOUR SUNGLASSES; LOOKING AT THE SUN: THE RISE OF THE NEW EAST 
ASIAN ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL SYSTEM, BY JAMES FALLOWS (PANTHEON: $25; 528 PP.)  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Andrew Horvat, The former Tokyo bureau chief for American Public Radio's 
Marketplace, Andrew Horvat is a visiting scholar at Stanford University's 
Center for East Asian Studies. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In "Looking at the Sun," James Fallows declares that the majority of Japan's 
nationally elected politicians are sons of politicians. The statement is one of 
many Fallows makes to warn American readers that Japan is not the democratic 
country they imagine it to be; it is also one of many that does not jibe with 
the facts. 
</P>
<P>
 While it is true that political families are more common in Japan than in the 
land of the Kennedys, Rockefellers or Browns, at last count, of 511 members of 
Japan's lower house, 114 (about one out of every five) were sons of 
politicians. Even by the most liberal reckoning, fewer than one-third of 
Japan's political elite is linked by marriage or blood ties to previously 
serving politicians. 
</P>
<P>
 An intriguing question that arises while one reads this book is why Fallows 
insists on gilding the lily? It seems that for this politically influential 
writer and broadcaster, it is not enough that Japan be alien, the country must 
also appear to be outlandish. This tendency is not merely a flaw of this book 
but of current thinking about Japan in Washington, where being tough on Japan 
seems to be far more important these days than having accurate information 
about the country. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Fallows, Japan is an undemocratic country where elections mean 
nothing, and where promises of reform cannot be trusted. Fallows' message is 
that Americans should cast off the illusions their own officials fed them 
during the Cold War about a democratic Japan committed to free market ideals 
and that they should see Japan as the originator of an alien system of 
state-supported capitalism which is now spreading through Asia and which 
challenges the long-term well-being of the Anglo-American world. After reading 
"Looking at the Sun," no one can accuse Fallows of being "soft on Japan." 
</P>
<P>
 As for being factually correct, that's another matter. There is a pattern to 
the inaccuracies in this book. For example, Fallows warns Americans that Japan 
is not a democratic country because power did not change hands through the 
ballot box for more than 100 years. What he does not say is that for the first 
22 of those 100 years Japan had no parliament. Then, until 1946 the prime 
minister did not have to be an elected politician, so it was impossible for 
voters to oust him. Fallows also does not say that when the constitution was 
changed after World War II, governments were voted in and out of office, in 
1947, 1949 and 1954. 
</P>
<P>
 Fallows also tells us that most of the members of the reformist coalition of 
former prime minister Morihiro Hosokawa (who took office in August last year) 
were until a few weeks earlier members of the corrupt, long-ruling Liberal 
Democratic Party. Fallows' idea is to show that Japanese promises of reform 
cannot be taken at face value. But this too is an example of imagination 
leaping ahead of easily available information. Of some 260 lower house members 
of Hosokawa's coalition last August, a mere 73 were former LDP politicians. 
</P>
<P>
 In spite of its many inaccuracies, or rather because of them, "Looking at the 
Sun" is an important book. Its negative view of Japan is shared by 
policy-makers in the Clinton Administration and this view forms the 
underpinnings of the present get-tough policy toward Tokyo on trade. The 
insistence of the Clinton Administration on getting the Japanese to agree to 
numerical targets on everything from market-opening measures to a reduction of 
Japan's trade deficits stems from the above kind of pessimistic assumptions 
about Japan. Incidentally, the present stalemate in U.S.-Japan trade 
negotiations is due in large part to the inflexibility of the numerical target 
strategy, an approach which assumes that in order to solve a trade dispute, it 
is enough if one side, the one with all the problems, agrees to change. 
</P>
<P>
 Why does this book contain serious inaccuracies? One reason is plain 
carelessness. At one point Fallows describes Sakhalin as a peninsula. When 
Chekhov wrote his book about the place in the last century, he called it "The 
Island," and when I visited Sakhalin a few years ago it was still neatly 
separated from Siberia by the Tatar Straits. 
</P>
<P>
 But another reason for Fallows' all-pervasive pessimism about Japan seems to 
be a visceral hostility toward the country. In one anecdote we are told that a 
teacher of Fallows' son praised the boy by saying his math was not bad for a 
foreigner. The story is presented as a way of showing that Japanese are 
racists. There are, indeed, many racists in Japan but when it comes to math 
scores, Japanese students outperform their U.S. counterparts on internationally 
administered tests by about 2 to 1. In this case, the teacher was probably 
trying to pay a compliment to Fallows' son. 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, Japan does have its problems; its political institutions are weak. 
But what Fallows does not tell us is that most Japanese, including some of the 
elite bureaucrats who wield much of the real power, fervently wish Japan had a 
government free of scandals at home, and more responsive to the rest of the 
world. Former Japanese Ambassador to Thailand Hisahiko Okazaki and former trade 
bureaucrat Taichi Sakaiya have written influential books saying just that. 
</P>
<P>
 Fallows is unfair both to former Japanese prime minister, Tsutomu Hata, and to 
his readers, when he describes Hata as a one-time LDP powerbroker best 
remembered for a gaffe about Japanese having intestines that are too long to 
digest large quantities of imported beef. Fallows does not tell us that Hata 
worked for years for electoral reform from within the LDP. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, in spite of Hata's remark about long Japanese intestines -- a remark 
which Hata has since admitted was inappropriate -- American beef is now widely 
available in Japanese supermarkets at reasonable prices. So much for a Japan 
that never changes.

 A MOTHER'S ORDEAL: One Woman's Fight Against China's One-Child Policy by 
Steven W. Mosher (HarperPerennial: $12; 335 pp.). As a nurse-practitioner in 
the field of women's health, An Chi found herself enforcing the one-child rule 
by compelling women to undergo sterilization and have abortions -- even during 
their ninth month.When her second child was born during a visit to the United 
States, she sought asylum from the persecution that would ensue if her family 
returned to China. An Chi's moving story reveals the misery of living under a 
corrupt government that penetrates the most intimate areas of life. But she 
fails to grasp the environmental impact of overpopulation, and blames many of 
the resulting problems on the mismanagement of the Chinese Communist Party.

 THE FRONTIERS OF LOVE by Diana Chang (University of Washington Press: $14.95; 
246 pp.) . Originally published in 1956, Chang's novel depicts characters of 
mixed Eurasian ancestry grappling with their identities. As the overseas 
Japanese empire crumbles, the old French Concession in Shanghai remains a 
cultural no-man's land, inhabited by expatriate Europeans and ethnic Chinese 
who "were either wealthy, Westernized, or prayed to a Christian God." Ignoring 
the conflicts wracking China, Sylvia Chen and her young friends who appear 
simultaneously "inexperienced and disillusioned" seek to resolve their ethnic 
allegiance: Uncomfortable with Occidentals, but divorced from their Asian 
heritage, they bury their Angst in idle pleasures.

 PROGRESSIVE GERMAN GRAPHICS 1900-1937 by Leslie Cabarga (Chronicle: $16.95; 
132 pp., paperback original). The efflorescence in the graphic arts that swept 
much of Europe during the late 19th Century came late to Germany. During the 
first third of the 20th Century, artists there seemed to make up for lost time, 
creating a wealth of bold posters, packages and trademarks. Like so many other 
artistic works, these elegant designs were sacrificed to the didactic realism 
endorsed by the Nazi regime.

 THE PIANO TUNER by Peter Meinke (University of Georgia Press: $11.95; 156 pp.) 
. Meinke's short stories depict people caught in alarming situations: Their 
inability to cope with anything outside normal experience reveals the decay of 
American society. In "Alice's Brother," a woman unnerved by her sibling's 
surgery delivers a desperate monologue reminiscent of a Dorothy Parker story; 
"Sealink" opens with the wonderfully incongruous line, "Emily had never hit a 
sheep before." Like Hans Christian Andersen's Emperor, Meinke's people stand 
exposed before the world, struggling to hide their vulnerability.

 IF MOUNTAINS DIE: A New Mexico Memoir by John Nichols, photographs by William 
Davis (Norton: $19.95; 144 pp.). When he celebrates the beauty of the mountains 
near his home in Taos, the author of "The Sterile Cuckoo" writes with 
contagious enthusiasm: "Sometimes you turn a corner and an aspen tree or the 
shape of a cloud will knock you flat on your ass with a quick little uppercut 
you never in a million years expected. . . ." Nichols contrasts the ethereal 
setting with humorous reflections on the crises of daily life.However, when he 
turns to local politics, Nichols trots out the cliches of '60s rhetoric, 
lamenting the displacement of local Hispanics by rich Anglo arrivistes -- 
forgetting or ignoring how recently he came to Taos.

 THE SAILOR WHO FELL FROM GRACE WITH THE SEA by Yukio Mishima, translated from 
the Japanese by John Nathan (Vintage: $10; 181 pp.) . Mishima's portrait of a 
nihilistic group of adolescents horrified readers when this novel appeared in 
America in 1965. Thirteen-year-old Noboru compares his heart to "a large iron 
anchor withstanding the corrosion of the sea and scornful of the barnacles and 
oysters that harass the hulls of ships, sinking polished and indifferent. . . 
." His alienated gang fixes their loathing on the title character, who has 
given up the sea for a bourgeois existence as Noboru's stepfather. In an era of 
drive-by shootings, the icy cruelty of Mishima's characters seems alarmingly 
prescient.

 PETERSON FIELD GUIDE TO VENOMOUS ANIMALS AND POISONOUS PLANTS by Steven Foster 
& Roger A. Caras (Houghton Mifflin: $15.95; 244 pp., illustrated, paperback 
original). Foster and Caras list arthropods that sting (bees, scorpions), 
reptiles that bite (10 species of rattlesnake live in California) and more 250 
species of plants can irritate the skin or cause sickness and death if 
ingested.The deathcap mushroom ( Amanita phalloides ) contains some of the most 
lethal toxins known, but such common plants as rhubarb (leaves) and castor bean 
(seeds) can also be deadly. Written to "help keep you out of trouble with 
nature, whether in a remote wilderness or around the house," this guide can 
prevent accidents on an outing -- or provide a reason to stay home with the 
doors and windows locked.

PALM LATITUDES: THE SCENE; CAFE SOCIEDAD 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Calle Primera in Ensenada, lined with touristy bars, restaurants, curio shops 
and assorted street vendors, is the last place you'd expect to see a beat cafe. 
But since October, Cafe Cafe has been serving up something unexpected amid the 
tourist strip's tequila shooters and somberos -- avant-garde culture. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's totally subversive," said the owner and manager Memo Ramirez, 
"subversive in a way that's aware of what's going on in the world." 
</P>
<P>
 The cafe has showcased discussions on the rebellion in Chiapas and screening 
of French movies not often seen north Mexico. It's a meeting place for kids 
from the local college and a place to hear the newest jazz and rock, live music 
and poetry -- real life amid the transience of the tourist trade. 
</P>
<P>
 It's also a refuge for musicians tired of waiting for permission to perform at 
government-sponsored culture halls. "This is a big-time tourist town, so we 
don't have places to play," said Jerry Lopez, an Ensenada musician and promoter 
who's booked his jazz and rock bands at Cafe Cafe. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramirez says he got a lot of funny looks when he said he wanted to open a beat 
cafe -- Baja California doesn't exactly have a cafe tradition. Residents and 
city officials, he says, are a little wary of the avant-garde, so he keeps a 
low profile, opening the place only on weekends and staffing it with friends 
who want to use Cafe Cafe as a sort of living room. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just a hole in the wall," said Ramirez. "But hopefully it will open many 
other walls in the search for the surreal." Andrew Asch

PALM LATITUDES: CLIQUES; FIRE, FRAUD AND FAITH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Ethan Allen Thomas Jr. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After an electrical fire destroyed much of the Greater Good Shepherd 
Missionary Baptist Church in South-Central L.A. in 1989, parishioners thought 
they had suffered the worst blow that could be dealt a God-fearing group. That 
was until the contractor they had hired to repair the structure in 1991 skipped 
out with more than $45,000 of the insurance company money, leaving them far 
short of the funds needed to finish the work. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, the 100 or so parishioners have been attending services in the 
dilapidated, graffiti-infested skeleton of the church on Florence Avenue, 
covering the chairs with plastic when it rains and piling on the jackets when 
the cold blows in. The unsecured structure has also been the target of thieves, 
who took the amplification system, so that the pastor now has to strain to be 
heard on Sundays. The one blessing? The atmosphere's far livelier than the 
mortuary where they held services after the fire. 
</P>
<P>
 "I look at this as on-the-job experience -- a test of faith," says the Rev. 
Joseph A. Freeman, the church's pastor. 
</P>
<P>
 The church needs another $80,000 to finish construction, which has been helped 
along by volunteers from the Southern Baptist Convention, the national 
governing group. The volunteer tradesmen work on the church when it can afford 
to buy materials. But the rebuilding is far from finished, and it may be up to 
strapped church members to find the means to hammer in those final nails. 
</P>
<P>
 "They must realize that if you don't do anything, then God won't do anything," 
says Freeman. Yet even with these blows to his faith, of one thing Freeman is 
confident: This is one establishment that won't be closed on Sunday. Ethan 
Allen Thomas Jr.

ALIENS ATTEMPT TO SAVE EARTH!; ABDUCTION: HUMAN ENCOUNTERS WITH ALIENS, BY JOHN 
MACK, M.D. (SCRIBNER'S: $22; 432 PP.)  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Susan Dewan, Susan Dewan is a free-lance writer.

<TEXT>
<P>
 This book is not fiction. It is not quite fact. It belongs to a category we do 
not possess in literature -- works about the unknown or the unknowable. 
"Abduction" is a thoughtful documentation of the cases of 13 men and women who 
have come to John E. Mack, a Harvard psychiatrist and Pulitzer Prize winning 
author (for his biography of T. E. Lawrence, "A Prince of Our Disorder") 
seeking to gain access to their own memories and integrate these memories into 
their daily lives and relationships. These are people who have experienced 
abductions by alien beings. Often these incidents began in early childhood; in 
a few cases, experiences predate physical birth as we know it. 
</P>
<P>
 Mack has carefully and consciously built on the work of UFO and abduction 
researchers such as Budd Hopkins and Jacques Valles, who have been working in 
this field for many years. 
</P>
<P>
 It would be tragic if this provocative work were judged in a debate over 
whether UFOs and their alien crews are "real." In every case described by Dr. 
Mack there are concrete physical findings that follow abductions, ranging from 
UFO sightings in the community, burned earth where the ships have landed, 
unexplained or missing pregnancies, a variety of physical lesions and also the 
recovery of tiny objects from the bodies of the abductees. 
</P>
<P>
 But much more important than the endless debate over whether UFOs are real is 
Mack's focus on the similarities in what people say they learned from their 
abduction. There is a central message that emerges in every case. It is not a 
message that is unique to alien beings. The messenger may be strange, having 
gray skin, large heads and huge dark almond shaped eyes, but the message can be 
heard all over the world. Let me put this simply. We are being told by the 
aliens that we are a species run amok. Our greed and destructiveness have taken 
us to the brink of destroying ourselves and our planet. According to Dr. Mack, 
virtually every abductee receives information about the destruction of the 
earth's ecosystem and feels compelled to do something about it. Some receive 
this information in childhood and others as part of the growing trust in their 
alien/human relationships. 
</P>
<P>
 Why would intelligent life from other planets or dimensions care if we destroy 
ourselves? Perhaps it is like one of the experiencers said, "If you take one 
part of the tapestry and put a hole in it, or you rend it, you wreck the parts 
that are next to it." If one part of the universe can be harmed by another, can 
there also be a self-correcting mechanism as well? This would be similar to 
what some biologists and the environmentally attuned call "Gaia" in regards to 
the functioning of the planet earth. Could it be the same in the universe as 
well? 
</P>
<P>
 This book is a challenge to any reader. It raises questions about how we live 
on this planet and with each other that the western mind and culture will not 
be able to ignore for too much longer. It also raises questions about the 
nature of reality, of time, space, energy and the true nature of humanness. It 
opens the door to a very serious redefining of life as we know it. 
</P>
<P>
 This evening I caught the tail end of a piece of the news on a local station. 
Recent findings show that the residues from pesticides and herbicides found on 
fruits and vegetables can't all be washed or peeled off. What does this have to 
do with aliens you might wonder? I guess I just have a hard time viewing 
intelligence as alien, especially when it presents me with another view of what 
I know to be true. 
</P>
<P>
 The physical laws we know are coming up short. The U.S. government funded 
program, SETI (Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence) operates on the 
assumption that extraterrestrial intelligence could be found by sending radio 
waves into space. As philosopher Terence McKenna has suggested, "To search 
expectantly for a radio signal from an extraterrestrial source is probably as 
culture-bound a presumption as to search the galaxy for a good Italian 
restaurant." 
</P>
<P>
 "Abduction" is also available abridged on audiocassette, read by Josef Sommer 
(Simon & Schuster Audio, two cassettes, $17).

JUST WRITE A REALLY GOOD BOOK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's a billion dollar a year industry and two thousand people gathered last 
weekend at the Marriott Marquis in New York to celebrate it: the Romance Novel. 
Romance Writers of America sponsored the four day convention, which was big and 
hectic, populated with all manner of people trying to grab a piece of the 
publishing pie. 
</P>
<P>
 Basically, there were two thousand plots in search of an Editor. And the 
Editors were there. Every paperback publisher was represented, and usually by 
the entire editorial staff: Dell, Avon, Baen, Pocket, Tor, Zebra, Bantam, 
Warner, Berkley and many more. These weary people patiently answered the 
hundreds of questions thrown at them: "Would you be interested in...?" A 
question always answered in the affirmative, with one important qualifier: "If 
it's a really good book...." 
</P>
<P>
 The conference rooms swarmed with the Editor's close companions: the Agents, 
who picked up the lunch tabs. The conference offered over a hundred classes and 
events for writers, including "Revealing Garments, A Short History of Women's 
Underwear," "POV Problems -- Or Whose Head Am I In?," How To Turn Your Novel 
into an Audio Entertainment,"Police Procedures for Writers," "Science Fiction, 
Fantasy and Paranormal Editor Panel," A WICCA representative who taught writers 
how to draw a realistic portrait of a witch. And there were some impossible 
classes, too: "Time Travel, How To Make It Believable," or "How to Make The New 
York Times Bestseller List." (Write a really good book, said the panelists, to 
which someone commented that there must be another way, "I mean just look at 
last week's list...." 
</P>
<P>
 There were big name stars (anyone whose print run goes over two hundred and 
fifty thousand copies) and these people filled the rooms with their relentless 
self promotion, concealing the quiet desperation of the authors as the 
competition grows fiercer; over 150 romance titles are published each month. 
This means a smaller percentage of books sold and ever-shrinking advances. 
Sometimes it means being dropped from a publisher's list altogether -- the kiss 
of death. Zebra books and Pinnacle recently let go of nearly fifty authors, 
writers who will have to erase their publishing historties, change their names 
and start all over again. 
</P>
<P>
 The real stars were the still unpublished authors who had gathered so many 
rejection letters, and yet still clung tightly to their dreams. They were the 
people listening intently to every piece of advice offered by anyone, all of 
which could be boiled down into one neat phrase: "Write a really good book." 
And then offer a clean 15% to an agent.

VOICES IN THE NIGHT; THE ICE STORM, BY RICK MOODY (LITTLE, BROWN: $19.95; 288 
PP.)

<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 This is not so much a novel as an excavation -- of that nearly but not quite 
extinct entity the nuclear family as it was in those dark ages, the 1970s. The 
argot, the foibles, the fads and the artifacts: They're all here, meticulously 
catalogued and historically framed with discussions of the design, politics and 
groping psychology of the period. In the midst of this exactingly reconstructed 
rubble we find the Hoods, a family of four. Because the Hoods live in the 
suburbs -- in "the most congenial and superficially calm of suburbs" -- we may 
be sure there's plenty to uncover, all manner of unsuspected subterranean 
doings and undoings. And in fact, the Hoods are having quite a day, which is to 
say, night. 
</P>
<P>
 Informed by insights from Masters & Johnson and "I'm Okay, You're Okay" and 
Marvel Comics and Creem, these four are playing out the defining act of their 
family drama -- and that they're each doing their parts separately says a lot 
about what's happening to them. Because of the extended paraphrases and 
quotations and references that bolster and bracket each character's point of 
view, the Hoods certainly seem to be emblematic of their time, which makes 
their emotional isolation, the private and solitary nature of their 
disintegration, all the more poignant, as if they're cut off even from the 
sense -- a faint comfort -- that their problems are as broadly human as they 
are specific to a particular person, place and date. 
</P>
<P>
 It's 1973, the day after Thanksgiving, the place is New Canaan, Conn., and "So 
let me dish you this comedy about a family I knew when I was growing up," the 
book begins. The narrator, who promises to reveal his part in all this later, 
is a tricky one from the start, a singular, sentient being who tells his story 
from several points of view, no more than one of which he could possibly know 
in such interior detail. The perspectives thus imagined are the mother's and 
father's (Elena and Ben), the children's (Paul, 16, and Wendy, 14), and briefly 
the neighbor boy, Mike's. First of all, Ben: He's waiting in the neighbor's 
guest room for his mistress, the neighbor's wife, who seems to have eluded him 
for the moment. While searching for her, he surprises his daughter and Mike in 
the basement, with their pants down. And so we are set upon the crisscrossing 
paths of the night, the fumblings and experiments, confessions and discoveries 
that lead to a grim dawn in which this family's present and future crystallize 
in the frozen devastation of an ice storm. 
</P>
<P>
 Virtually all of these paths take us through the sexual muddlings and 
imaginings of the family members, from Wendy's rather odd manipulations of the 
neighbor boys to Paul's wistful attempt to seduce a schoolmate to their 
parents' complicated spouse swapping at something called a "key party." 
Everyone's confused to begin with and, caught overnight in the weather and 
their various liaisons, much more confused by the end. What's become clear, 
though, is that this misalliance of fate, their family, is finally falling 
apart. When a calamity -- senseless, the narrator concedes -- treats the Hoods 
and their neighbors to "the spectacle of a lost future," we're told, "it 
brought them together and it drove them apart but maybe this parting was 
inevitable anyway," and the same could be said for the Hood family itself. 
</P>
<P>
 Though split in perspective among the characters, this story is largely 
uniform in style, rendered in short sentences, many of them not really 
sentences but bright staccato beats that hammer home a point or ring a few 
changes on it or take it one step further. This uniformity draws things 
together and makes sense if one person is finally responsible for mapping the 
moments of all the others, but it also occasionally gives the lie to these 
people's supposed thoughts, especially those of the more-than-precocious Wendy. 
Paul, however, always rings perfectly true, stuck in adolescence and testing 
its edges, a boy-man with remarkable insights and remarkable lapses, and the 
rich, murky wonder of his passages stands out all along as a clue to the source 
and meaning of the story. And if one clear voice emerges from this dark night 
of the family, there's hope -- as well another indication that what's lurking 
under the calm surface of the suburbs is great raw material for the novelist.

A LAPSE OF FAITH; ANNUNCIATION, BY DAVID PLANTE (TICKNOR & FIELDS: $21.95; 346 
PP.)  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Scott Collins, Scott Collins is a free-lancer who frequently writes about 
the arts. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 David Plante is far too serious-minded to be called a mystery writer. Yet his 
latest novel fits the bill as a mystery, an intellectual detective story set in 
a literate world of trendy London art galleries, medieval Italian cathedrals 
and snowy Moscow boulevards. 
</P>
<P>
 With "Annunciation," Plante, a prolific U.S.-born novelist who now lives in 
England, returns to a familiar theme: the loss of faith in a cruel world where 
faith is, paradoxically, both necessary and irrelevant. What is one left with, 
Plante's lapsed Catholic characters wonder, after one has left the church? 
</P>
<P>
 His vehicle here is a meticulously crafted allegory of redemption, told in 
sentences so prim and clean they almost squeak. While the book's measured, 
formal tone can keep the reader too far removed from the raw emotions at its 
core, this is a still a work of delicate plotting and beautiful complexity. 
</P>
<P>
 The tale is divided into two threads that gradually join. In the first, we 
meet Claire O'Connel, a middle-aged American art historian trying to build a 
new life in London after the drowning suicide of her husband, Frank. 
</P>
<P>
 Claire's new suitor, a well-meaning but superficial British investment banker 
named George, would like to marry. But those plans are shelved when Claire's 
16-year-old daughter Rachel becomes pregnant after being raped on her way home 
from school. 
</P>
<P>
 The other narrative thread involves Claude Ricard, a young, New York-based 
editor of art books. Frustrated by his inability to connect with others, Claude 
nearly suffers a nervous breakdown after a distant relative commits suicide. 
After a great deal of agonizing, he accepts a temporary assignment in London. 
</P>
<P>
 What unites the two strands is Claire's quixotic search for a lost painting by 
an Italian Renaissance painter named Pietro Testa. The art world considers 
Testa a minor figure, but Claire finds personal meaning in the darkness framing 
his compositions -- and in the painter's sad personal life. 
</P>
<P>
 "That (Claire) was writing about Pietro Testa, the large, dark man who had 
committed suicide, because Frank, also large and dark, had committed suicide, 
was too obvious a connection for her to think it was anything but accidental," 
the narrator notes in typically deadpan fashion. 
</P>
<P>
 The lost painting is Testa's depiction of the Annunciation, the New Testament 
incident when the angel Gabriel first revealed to Mary that she was pregnant 
with Jesus. 
</P>
<P>
 The parallel to Rachel's situation is obvious, though left artfully unstated, 
and Claire's search for the painting becomes a highly emotional personal 
odyssey that leads her and Rachel first to the medieval Italian town of Lucca 
and ultimately to a series of sparsely furnished flats and moldy attics in 
Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
 Needless to say, Plante is interested in whether religion and high art can 
help people find meaning in their everyday lives. But he doesn't stop there. In 
some of the novel's most arresting passages, he explores the sinister, 
despairing face of post-Cold War Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
 The narrator depicts a Russian capital full of embittered old Communist 
loyalists and even older sons and daughters of exiled czarist aristocrats, who 
have returned to a city they no longer recognize. 
</P>
<P>
 The book suggests the Russians have committed their own figurative suicide, 
first with a revolution, then a totalitarian regime, and now with political and 
social chaos (one Muscovite reports that he carries his windshield wipers with 
him because thieves might steal them off the car). 
</P>
<P>
 Plante also excels with minute descriptions that give the novel a remarkable 
sensuousness. There are vivid portraits even of minor characters, such as the 
underworld Russian whose "large dark eyes didn't smile but filled with liquid, 
which almost overflowed the rims of his lower lids in tears." 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, this skill does not always translate into deep, fully rounded 
characterizations. For instance, the narrator tells us that Rachel, who is 
perhaps the pivotal character, is intelligent and strong-willed, but she 
nevertheless remains out of focus. Because we learn so much about Rachel only 
through Claire's eyes, we remain distant from her. 
</P>
<P>
 Plante's dialogue occasionally succumbs to his pervasive high-mindedness. 
Hotel-room conversations can quickly deteriorate into phony-sounding 
philosophical discourses ("(D)o you think that deep down, our impulse is not to 
save but to destroy?"). Such clinkers, combined with a monochromatic tone and a 
rather oppressive lack of humor, make for long stretches midway through the 
book. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, one finishes "Annunciation" a little amazed at how deftly Plante has 
managed to weave the novel's complicated parts into a coherent whole. It is 
elegant and ultimately life-affirming -- a mystery in the best sense of the 
word.

STYLE: GARDENS; PAINT, PAVE & PLANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Robert Smaus 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Paint isn't usually found in a garden-maker's toolbox, but it should be -- 
particularly in the small urban spaces of Southern California. Flowers, 
furniture and garden ornaments are often seen against blank walls instead of 
lush trees and shrubs, so painting these surfaces can help blend house and 
garden into a harmonious whole. In the three gardens shown here, lawns gave way 
to plants that are thrifty with water, but that was almost coincidental. The 
main objective was to create -- using a little paint, a little paving and a 
rich palette of plants -- gardens that look right in our dry and sunny climate. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Like a drab cocoon, Cheryl Lerner's Hancock Park house once was painted 
barracks beige and floated in a sea of suffering lawn. Four years ago, it 
emerged a glorious butterfly, splashed with nine different colors and 
surrounded by a stunning garden. 
</P>
<P>
 L.A. architect Brian Tichenor began the metamorphosis by painting the 
Italianate house Mediterranean red, ocher and green, and laying out paths and 
patios. Lerner, starting her career as a garden designer, choreographed the 
yellow, gold and orange plantings. Having lived in Italy, she had Portofino and 
its brightly painted houses and gray-green landscapes in mind. 
</P>
<P>
 Together, owner and architect tackled the small back yard where previous 
residents tried to grow a lawn in water-logged soil. Terra-cotta-colored 
concrete and a fanciful outdoor fireplace turned the space into a cozy garden 
room, where walls are hung with vines and potted plants. 
</P>
<P>
 The side yard, an old driveway closed off from the street by a massive gate, 
became another room. Cracked concrete was visually softened with earth-colored 
chemical stains and, along pathways, combined with mosaics of Italian tile that 
simulate puddles. Lerner covered all four walls with antique and modern 
varieties of climbing roses, lightly shading one corner with a blue palo verde 
( Cercidium floridum ). 
</P>
<P>
 In front, two gardens enjoy privacy behind a hedge of misty gray Pittosporum 
crassifolium , a row of lavender and a still-lower line of Rudbeckia 
'Goldstrum'. Rambunctious Mermaid roses climb the red wall in both spaces. An 
olive and several buddleias in large urns shade one garden, while the other is 
simply a path through a mix of perennials, herbs and small shrubs. Everything 
grows with abbondanza , the Italian word Lerner uses to describe the chaotic 
but cheerful abundance. BEYOND THE WATER'S EDGE 
</P>
<P>
 Venice landscape designer Barry Campion encountered a handsome 
Mediterranean-style house encircled by an unlikely lawn, but in this case, the 
back yard featured a charming old fountain that looked as if it had been 
plucked from a Spanish courtyard. While house and fountain complemented each 
other nicely, the surburban carpet looked out of place. 
</P>
<P>
 To remedy the situation for the new owners (who had recently remodeled and 
repainted the Santa Monica house), Campion repaired and re-tiled the fountain 
and gave it a proper setting with slabs of sandstone and decomposed granite 
paths. The decomposed granite suits the clay color of the house, but Campion 
chose it for another reason: She could plant through it. What often happens 
naturally in older gardens -- seeds sprouting in unplanned places -- Campion 
made sure of. Tucked here and there, even growing under a garden bench, her 
sun-loving plants take the shine off the garden so that it doesn't seem so new 
next to the gracious old residence. Did the sunroses, salvias, thyme, 
snow-in-summer and Swan River daisies from Australia seed themselves, or were 
they planted? It's hard to tell. 
</P>
<P>
 To make the most of a good thing, Campion framed the fountain with a pergola 
that stretches along the back of the property. A massive affair, it was built 
to hold its own against the two-story house. Stuccoed pillars were painted the 
same shade as the building to tie the two together. In summer, climbing roses 
provide much-appreciated shade; in winter, they are bare to let in the warming 
sun. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the sparkle and splash of water are seen and heard amid rich-hued paint, 
neutral paving and dry-weather plants, in a setting where all of the details 
are in keeping with the home's Old World character. PATHS OF FIRE 
</P>
<P>
 Photographer Mike Chesser had already borrowed colors from his 1950s Los Feliz 
house and, with paint roller in hand, transformed his concrete-block garden 
walls from a liability into an asset. Then Sierra Madre landscape designer Roy 
Wiskar, with an astonishing assortment of plants, turned the garden itself into 
a horticultural gold mine. 
</P>
<P>
 Australian kangaroo paws ( Anigozanthus 'Bush Gem') and New Zealand flax 
(Phormium tenax 'Maori Sunrise') echo some of the burnt orange walls. The gold 
walls silhouette the flaming orange flowers of lion's tail ( Leonotis ) and 
red-hot poker (Kniphofia ) and the lipstick-red blooms of the misnamed 
California fuchsia (which is very un fuchsia-like in that it loves heat and 
drought). And the house's subtle shade of green is repeated in the olive leaves 
of elaeagnus and Eucalyptus nicholii , which rings the landscape with 
peppermint-scented foliage. 
</P>
<P>
 Wiskar calls this a "walkabout garden" but not because there are so many 
Australian trees and shrubs. Steppingstones lead everywhere, covering a good 
deal of the ground. Between the pavers, blue fescue, lamb's ears and thyme 
soften the trek and perfume the air. 
</P>
<P>
 The goal of all this planting was to screen a swimming pool from view and 
create the illusion of a larger back yard. Most of the surrounding concrete was 
trucked out, leaving just enough for two sitting areas. Plants were layered 
between house and pool -- a drift of chest-high perennials and shrubs, then a 
path, then another windrow of plants and another path. So while the pool may 
still be the ultimate destination, there is much to entertain the eye while 
getting there.

VENETIAN CLASS; GUINEA HEN. GOOSE-BREAST PROSCIUTTO. BLACK RISOTTO. NOT YOUR 
EVERYDAY ITALIAN MENU. 
</P>

 At one end of Santa Monica's Third Street Promenade, heavy terra-cotta pots 
and canvas market umbrellas mark off the tiny sidewalk terrace of Remi, an 
oasis of good taste in the midst of flashy fast-food outlets and tired trendy 
venues.  
</P>
<P>
 It's not exactly new -- it opened in 1990 -- but Remi is one of the most 
consistent and truly pleasant Italian restaurants in L.A. It's not too loud. 
The lighting gives everyone a Scavullo-like glow. And the blue-and 
white-striped canvas banquettes and the dainty chairs with bowed legs are 
actually comfortable. Designer Adam Tihany has an eye for subtly beautiful 
details: watery handblown glass chandeliers, smart yellow-and-red glass sconces 
from Murano, a polished hardwood floor striped in lighter wood. 
</P>
<P>
 The menu, too, takes its inspiration from the Veneto. You can begin with a 
definitive version of carpaccio (the dish of finely sliced raw beef that was 
virtually invented at Harry's Bar in Venice), then order the dark risotto with 
squid ink or a classic fegato alla veneziana (calves' liver with caramelized 
onions and grilled polenta); and for dessert, a straightforward tiramisu or a 
plate of delicate little Venetian cookies.  
</P>
<P>
 The chef is Josie Le Balch, who has been cooking here since the beginning. She 
was trained by the original chef-owner, Francesco Antinucci, a Venetian, who 
left after a few months to reopen the original New York Remi in a larger space. 
(There are also Remis in Mexico City and Tel Aviv.) Le Balch has a fine, 
restrained hand and an instinctive understanding of the simplicity and clean, 
focused flavors of northern Italian cooking. While she's true to its spirit, 
her menu doesn't read like that of every other restaurant on the canal.  
</P>
<P>
 To start, there's a sumptuous smoked goose-breast prosciutto luxuriously 
perfumed with truffle oil. One night, you could also order bresa ola , a ruddy, 
cured, air-dried beef from the mountains that is usually garnished with a 
thread of olive oil. The sharp and peppery arugula salad, with its pounded 
walnut-olive sauce, shaved Parmesan and soft, caramelized, slightly 
sweet-and-sour shallots, was excellent. The "grappalox" is another sterling 
starter: gorgeous and satiny, with the faint taste of grappa and crushed pink 
peppercorns. The lightly breaded scallops with a delicious, earthy salad of 
cannellini and borlotti beans is also delicious. 
</P>
<P>
 The kitchen will make half orders of pasta dishes (but not risotto) or split 
an order for a slight charge. I could have happily eaten an entire order of the 
pasta special one night, penne with speck (smoked, raw-cured ham) and baby 
artichokes in a light tomato sauce. What's puzzling is how penne piccanti on 
another occasion could have come from the same kitchen. The overcooked pasta 
was cloaked in a terribly over-reduced tomato sauce. It's back to Pasta 101 for 
this one. 
</P>
<P>
 Le Balch's heart seems to be more in the specials, like the exemplary handmade 
agnolotti with a classic filling of ricotta and fresh spinach, tossed in 
browned butter and frizzled sage leaves. Ravioli Marco Polo, filled with fresh 
tuna in a shrimp-tomato sauce and topped with shreds of ginger, sounds 
intriguing, but in the end, this melding of East and West just doesn't work. 
</P>
<P>
 Risotto is notoriously difficult to make in a restaurant. Remi comes through 
with an outstanding risotto al nero di seppie , rice cooked with squid and its 
rich, sea-scented ink. A risotto special one night of shrimp and radicchio was 
in the same league. The spinach gnocchi? Well, I found them just a bit gummy, 
the tomato sauce again too thick.  
</P>
<P>
 Among the eight secondi , the Chilean sea bass is an appealing update on the 
Venetian sweet and sour pesce en sao r . Here the flaky filets are presented 
with rosy vinegar-marinated onions and sultanas. Rolled in cracked pepper, the 
rare ahi tuna with a dice of tomatoes and grilled bitter endive is about as 
good a version as I've had. The guinea hen is another excellent choice, the 
flavorful bird simply grilled and served with soft polenta, carrots and 
pancetta. But the big Florentine-style steak is no match for the fiorentina 
served at Campanile. 
</P>
<P>
 For dessert, consider the rustic apple tart or the budino , a round of barely 
sweetened, extravagantly rich mascarpone set on a layer of fresh berries. Or 
the starfish-shaped zabaglione , browned in the oven and served with a scoop of 
crema gelato.  
</P>
<P>
 Ordering wine from Remi's list can be frustrating; the best bottles are 
overpriced, and when you do find an affordable Italian wine, it often turns out 
to be a mediocre vintage. The 1991 Anselmi Soave Classico "Capitel Croce" ($25) 
and the 1990 Frescobaldi Chianti Rufina "Nipozzano" riserva ($35) are among the 
best choices from this uninspired list.  
</P>
<P>
 Remi is one of the few cigar-friendly restaurants in town. There's no smoking 
in the restaurant proper, though it is allowed at the bar, but after dinner, 
you can purchase a Davidoff cigar and retire either to the terrace or to the 
wine room (if it's not booked) for a smoke and a glass of spirits. It does have 
an enticing array of cognacs, armagnacs and, especially, grappas, more than 45, 
including several outstanding examples from the reigning queen of grappa, 
Giannola Nonino ($25 a shot), and from the top Veneto producer, Jacopo Poli 
($15 to $20 a shot). 
</P>
<P>
 Prices like these may be one reason why the grappa craze seems to have peaked. 
(In all fairness, Remi does have a number of less distinguished Italian grappas 
in the $8 to $10 range.) Still, there's no more Italian way to end a meal at 
this dependable Santa Monica spot than with a few drops of the fiery spirit. 
</P>
<P>
 Remi Restaurant, 1451 Third Street Promenade, Santa Monica; (310) 393-6545. 
Smoking in bar and wine room. Valet parking on Broadway. Dinner for two, food 
only, $49-$95. Corkage, $10.

ON THE RECORD: ORPHEUS' ENERGETIC SPONTANEITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The thought expressed in this column on an earlier occasion, that the best 
conductor for some music is no conductor at all, applies again in a pair of 
Deutsche Grammophon CDs documenting the conductorless Orpheus Chamber 
Orchestra's latest, happy encounters with symphonies of Joseph Haydn. 
</P>
<P>
 To obtain such felicitous results, Orpheus may rehearse/play each work 
countless times, but if so, the members have managed to retain the same feeling 
of energetic spontaneity that Haydn brought to the music itself. 
</P>
<P>
 One disc (439 779) is devoted to a pair of the lesser-known but no longer 
obscure nickname symphonies, both in the key of D: No. 53, called "L'Imperiale" 
for having (possibly) been performed for the Empress Maria Theresia in 1780, 
and No. 73, named "La Chasse" for the hunt-inspired horn fanfares of the 
galloping finale. The hardly less engaging or inventive No. 79, in F, rounds 
out the program. 
</P>
<P>
 The other disc (437 783) pairs the fantastic notions of the Symphony No. 60 in 
C, subtitled "Il Distratto" (The Absent-Minded Man) after a play of that name 
to which its movements originally served as incidental music, and the blithely 
elegant No. 91 in E-flat, with the dazzling overture to the opera "Armida" as a 
bonus. 
</P>
<P>
 In all the foregoing, the Orpheus players show the keenest appreciation for 
some of Haydn's wildest, wittiest harmonic inventions and delivers them with 
optimum individual skill and ensemble cohesiveness. 
</P>
<P>
 It may have something to do with the instruments they're playing -- Orpheus' 
are modern -- but above all it's who's up front, conductor Frans Bruggen, that 
characterizes the Haydn performances by the period-instrument Orchestra of the 
18th Century. 
</P>
<P>
 Bruggen is responsible for minimizing the splendors of two of the greatest, 
and still least familiar of the "London" symphonies, No. 97 in C and No. 98 in 
B-flat (Philips 434 921). 
</P>
<P>
 The angularity of Haydn's phrases, his jolting harmonic changes and dynamic 
contrasts are smoothed out by the conductor in what can only be considered acts 
of perversion. In Bruggen's hands such markings as vivace and presto assai are 
next to meaningless. 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, three of Haydn's very grand "Paris" Symphonies -- No. 85 in 
B-flat ("La Reine"), No. 86 in D, No. 87 in A -- may suffer from a surfeit of 
energy in the ongoing cycle of complete Haydn symphonies on the Hyperion label 
in which Roy Goodman directs from the harpsichord the antiquarian Hanover Band 
(66535). 
</P>
<P>
 Still, this is one of the most successful components of the series to date, 
with Goodman ratcheting down the speed, fury and almost giddy enthusiasm just 
that notch required to eliminate any notion of frenzy. 
</P>
<P>
 One nevertheless wonders why the harpsichord continuo is needed in works so 
richly scored and lacking the necessity for harmonic filling-in. 
</P>
<P>
 Some 20 years ago, when Neville Marriner's Academy of St. Martin in the Fields 
was still a small orchestra (and still had its hyphens), its performances of 
all six "Paris" symphonies represented cutting-edge-vital Haydn. Today, 
reissued in Philips' valuable and inexpensive "Duo" series (438 727, 2 CDs) 
they sound ever so slightly thick in sonority. But they remain alert, exuberant 
readings that did much to influence other musicians to create today's up-tempo, 
sharply inflected approach to the composer. 
</P>
<P>
 The middle-period symphonies selected by conductor-scholar John Hsu are of 
quasi-chamber proportions and are played by the excellent period-instrument 
Apollo Ensemble, whose numbers duplicate those of Haydn's own 1760s Esterhazy 
court band: a half-dozen violins, a single viola, cello and bass, pairs of 
oboes and horns, one bassoon and keyboard continuo. 
</P>
<P>
 The works are the rollicking No. 35 in B-flat -- one of those pieces in which 
one can never anticipate what is coming next, yet when it's all over seems 
perfectly logical, if not foreordained; the hardly less engaging and 
surprise-filled No. 42 in D, and the galant No. 23 in G (Dorian 90191).*

POP EYE: LOVE AND HOLE READY TO ROLL? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Steve Hochman

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Here comes Courtney Love again. 
</P>
<P>
 And not just on computer bulletin boards. 
</P>
<P>
 Details are being worked out for Love to take her band Hole on the road, 
resuming a career that was sidetracked by the April suicide of her husband Kurt 
Cobain and the May death of Hole bassist Kristen Pfaff. 
</P>
<P>
 Those tragedies understandably overshadowed the April release of Hole's 
acclaimed album, "Live Through This," and forced the cancellation of a 
promotional tour. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan now being discussed would have Hole open shows for Nine Inch Nails 
this fall, including a possible stop at the Universal Amphitheatre. 
</P>
<P>
 Love, who is auditioning bassists, tested the performing waters last week with 
a surprise appearance at "Lollapalooza" in Philadelphia, where she performed 
two songs alone with acoustic guitar. 
</P>
<P>
 "Courtney needs to do what's best for her, and being on stage is cathartic and 
an honest, real thing," says Hole manager Janet Billig. 
</P>
<P>
 What about fans who feel Love is exploiting the two tragedies by touring so 
soon? 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't think about that," Billig says. "You just have to go do it and hope 
people accept it." 
</P>
<P>
 But will they? 
</P>
<P>
 While reactions to Love's "Lollapalooza" performance was reportedly favorable, 
feelings have been mixed about her attending the recent "MTV Film Awards" show 
so shortly after Cobain's death, and about the often harsh dialogue she's 
carried on with fans and detractors via the America Online computer service. 
</P>
<P>
 "To ask her not to perform would be cruel and unwarranted," said one top music 
industry publicist, who asked not to be identified. "If she goes out and it's 
great music, she should do fine. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd advise her that she should go on tour but not talk a lot. If she goes out 
and puts on good shows people will get the point. Her personal life is her own. 
I don't think there's anything to say that she can't say with a guitar."  
</P>
<P>
 Nine Inch Nails leader Trent Reznor is glad to give Love an opportunity to 
tour, and agrees that as long as she lets her music do the talking, she'll be 
received well. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's in a tough position, based so much on the personality and the tabloid 
elements that surround her, versus the music," Reznor says. "But the music's 
really good, and that's where at the end of the day she's standing on two legs. 
I don't know her, but purely as music I respect what she does, and that makes 
me want to help her." 
</P>
<P>
 Billig says she does not know whether Love has written new songs since 
Cobain's death, though Love reportedly read several poems dealing with her loss 
during a gathering in Philadelphia the day before the "Lollapalooza" show.

SOUND & VISION: MIX-A-LOT FRONTS A FLASHY NEW VIEWPOINT

<P>
 If there was a "Baby's Got Back," it was probably inevitable there'd be a 
"Baby's Got Front." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the breast-obsessed new video "Put 'Em on the Glass" marks an instant 
rift in rapper Sir Mix-a-Lot's unlikely alliance with those women who saw his 
paean to plump derrieres, "Baby's Got Back," as a liberating corrective to 
thin-is-better stereotypes.

 In a perfect world, Mix-a-Lot's successive bigger-is-better odes to select 
erogenous zones might drop to much the same reaction, positive or negative. But 
we live in the world of real women, vast American percentages of whom are 
convinced that their butts are too big, far fewer of whom are looking to be 
assuaged by a blue rapper that their busts really aren't too large after all 
(or assured that they would make nice hood ornaments). 
</P>
<P>
 R.I.P., Sir Mix-a-Lot, progressive feminist hero. Long live Sir Mix-a-Lot, 
patron saint of young lads everywhere.

 MTV, bless its soul, rejected this clip -- helping make it No. 1 on 
all-request cable outlet the Box, where it airs about every 15 minutes or so. 
The ludicrously outsize prurience of "Put 'Em on the Glass" is put up against 
the glass bottom of this month's edition of Sound & Vision, where pop music 
videos are rated on a 0-100 scale.

 The Beastie Boys, "Sabotage." Just when you thought every last vestige of the 
'70s had been revived and discarded, the Boys' latest is a fond, hyperactive 
homage to the TV cop shows of that era. The video runs like a hellishly paced, 
nonstop montage of credit sequences from "Mannix" and its ilk -- all car chases 
and chops-busting. The Beasties themselves appear as the principals, in 
ridiculous period curly wigs and mustaches. All that is missing is the proper 
end title: A Quinn Martin Production. 78

 Public Enemy, "Give It Up." Remember when PE was considered -- for better or 
worse, rightly or wrongly -- the edge of the envelope, as went dangerously 
radical, arms-carrying pan-Africanism in rap? How times and trends have 
conspired to make PE's most incendiary past missives seem moderate. And the 
group itself is preaching outright positivity this time out. Is the world ready 
for . . . Public Friend? 
</P>
<P>
 On a spaceship hovering over Earth, clay animation doppelgangers of members 
Chuck D., Flavor Flav, et al watch the violent goings-on in the black community 
before letting loose a "culture ray" that magically turns guns into books 
before an endangered school kid's eyes. Part of the video is also dedicated to 
savagely parodying such rap trends as gangsta women, gangsta kids and gangsta 
white boys. 
</P>
<P>
 The hard-core camp may not take to PE's anti-drug preaching, but it's a 
welcome drop in the bucket. 76

 Smashing Pumpkins, "Rocket." Speaking of bands in spacesuits, the scenario 
here is straight out of Joe Dante's "Explorers": Pre-pubescent kids raid a jet 
scientist's junkyard and put together their own rocket ship, in which they 
promptly ditch their family summer barbecues in search of other planets. 
</P>
<P>
 The kids end up right back on Earth, with a not-quite-surprising twist: Billy 
Corgan and company are still strumming away as before, but the Pumpkins are 
gray old geezers now. You doubt it? If there can be a "Woodstock '94," there'll 
probably be a "Lollapalooza '19" too. 75

 Crash Test Dummies, "Afternoons and Coffeespoons." The Dummies are a bit too 
cute for their own good at times, and this is one of those times. But you've 
got to like a group that pens an ineffably catchy single whose lyric does 
nothing but nervously anticipate male-pattern baldness, adult diapers and 
death. And you've just about got to love a band whose video for said single 
features the singer on a gurney getting a catheter stuck up somewhere or 
another. (Extra bad-taste points for positioning the Grim Reaper in the 
hospital hallways.)60

 The Artist Formerly Known as Prince & Nona Gaye, "Love Sign." Gaye, playing an 
urban mercenary in unostentatious tight red leather, is assigned to kill 
TAFKAP, who, in true Bond fashion, assuages her homicidal intentions by 
sleeping with her. After this bedding, ex-spy Gaye becomes such a convert to 
the ways of love, in fact, that, post-coitally, she heads down to a "Guns for 
Tickets" exchange and turns in her firearms to the police. The director here, 
surprisingly, was gangsta antihero Ice Cube -- which is cause for curiosity: 
Was the video's final pro-gun-control scene -- in which folks hand over their 
firepower to the fuzz, for instant meltdown purposes -- really the idea of the 
famously cop-phobic Cube? 48

<P>
 Elton John, "Can You Feel the Love Tonight." The composer of the "Lion King" 
melodies is digitally deposited into some of the animated film's more pastoral 
scenes here, singing his own languorous version of the movie's love theme. 
Given how the once lionized singer is squandering his talent on ineffectual, 
by-the-book balladry like this these days, a weary former fan might be forgiven 
for wishing E.J. had been inserted into the wildebeest stampede instead. 37

 Sir Mix-a-Lot, "Put 'Em on the Glass." The rapper's latest single pays tribute 
to the gals who supposedly drive past him on the freeway at high speed and 
press their chests against car windows for his viewing pleasure -- a phenomenon 
we'll just have to take his word for. 
</P>
<P>
 When it came time to produce the video, someone apparently had second thoughts 
about just how unrealistically unwieldy it is to put flesh under glass from 
inside a moving vehicle -- unsafe at any speed, as our homeboy Ralph would say. 
So instead, this clip ingeniously shifts its focus toward female car-washers so 
dimwitted they occasionally mistake their bikini tops for squeegees. (Sometimes 
these top-heavy amnesiacs even forget their tops, but electronic scrambling 
takes care of that on commercial cable.) 
</P>
<P>
 Feminists may have their own order to give to Sir, without love, after this: 
Put 'em on the block, buster. 2 
</P>
<P>
 AT THE CAR WASH: It's clear to see what's on Sir Mix-a-Lot's mind as he 
surfaces with a sudsy squeegee squad for "Put 'Em on the Glass."

POP MUSIC CHARTS: HERE TO 'STAY'? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Lisa Loeb's "Stay," from the "Reality Bites" soundtrack, is one of the 
surprise hits of the year, topping The Times' Southern California pop singles 
chart and ranking second nationally. Such old-style folkie ballads rarely reach 
the Top 50, let alone the No. 1 spot. What's even more amazing is that Loeb is 
an unknown who's never recorded an album. In fact, she doesn't even have a 
record contract. Partly due to "Stay," the "Reality Bites" soundtrack is 
selling well--coming in at No. 17 on both the Southern California and national 
charts. TOP 10 ALBUMS 03,04,40,11 Title, Artist (Nat'l Rank) Last Week 1 The

 ***; SHARA NELSON, "What Silence Knows" ( Chrysalis/ERG ) 
</P>
<P>
 A trademark of the Pet Shop Boys is singing melancholy lyrics to perky dance 
beats, and they did it better than anyone until Nelson came along with this 
impressive debut solo album. The bouncy tempos add a strange tension to such 
songs as "Pain Revisited" and "One Goodbye in Ten," which tell depressing tales 
of broken relationships.Her ballads, including "Inside Out" and "What Silence 
Knows," are particularly gloomy. The heartache throbbing through these songs is 
magnified by Nelson's sorrowful wail. If you're feeling low about a rocky 
relationship, this album -- intense, well-written (by Nelson in collaboration 
with others) and crammed with insights -- makes a good companion. 
</P>

 New albums are rated on a scale of one star (poor), two stars (fair), three 
stars (good) and four stars (excellent). Dennis Hunt

 ** C+C Music Factory, "Anything Goes," Columbia. A disappointing follow-up to 
producers-writers Robert Clivilles and David Cole's 1990 debut, the dance-music 
classic "Gonna Make You Sweat."There are no irresistible funk-driven tracks, 
but there are a few red-hot Latin dance tunes featuring the hip-hop trio 
Trilogy. Martha Wash shines in a limited role, but lead singer Zelma Davis is a 
bore.

 *** Bob Woodruff, "Dreams and Saturday Nights," Asylum. The country newcomer 
(who appears at the House of Blues on Aug. 19) is a literate observer of life's 
gritty realities, and his underdog's-eye view makes him a spiritual descendant 
of Gram Parsons.If Woodruff has a fault, it's that he may have too much to say 
-- and often does. Musical textures are impressively varied, from 
Creedence-like swamp-rock to heartland rock to pure honky-tonk. New albums are 
rated on a scale of one star (poor), two stars (fair), three stars (good) and 
four stars (excellent).

RECORD RACK: MC EIHT HITS BULL'S EYE

 *** 1/2 MC Eiht, "We Come Strapped," Epic Street. The innovative music -- 
featuring the silky synthesizer sound of '70s R&B -- helps separate this from 
the rest of the gangsta-rap pack.So does Eiht's dramatic rapping, which adds a 
genuinely sinister quality to such songs as "Take 2 With Me." The fourth solo 
album by overlooked Eiht (a member of Compton's Most Wanted) is arguably the 
best of the year so far in the gangsta genre.

 *** Ahmad, "Ahmad," Giant. At 18, this South-Central rapper may seem a bit 
young for nostalgia pangs, but his hit single "Back in the Day" -- a yearning 
for a simpler times -- is still very convincing.It's the best song on the 
gangsta-flavored rookie effort by this nimble-tongued rhyming whiz. Mostly 
upbeat, always insightful and sometimes very funny.

 ** Diamond Rio, "Love a Little Stronger," Arista. What's the difference 
between Diamond Rio and the Cowardly Lion? The Cowardly Lion knew his heart was 
missing.The most interesting cut is "Appalachian Dream," a scenically winding 
instrumental. When it comes to songs with lyrics, any glimmers of honest 
expression are quickly extinguished by the surrounding emotional vacuum.

 AND ONE MORE THING: The Rhino Records store -- in the pre-CD days one of the 
top spots for used albums -- has found an appropriate way to celebrate its 21st 
birthday.Each Saturday this month, the Westwood store will hold a parking lot 
sale with every item going for just 21 cents. 
</P>
<P>
 The bulk of the material being sold was acquired recently from the estate of a 
collector who had amassed about 200,000 albums covering virtually all genres of 
music. A new batch of about 40,000 will be put out for each sale day, with 
those unsold at the end of the day carted away for a fitting demise: They'll be 
melted down and recycled for new LPs and singles.

 THE LATEST NUDES: Given the sexy overtones of 2 Live Crew leader Luther 
Campbell's songs and album covers, his latest venture shouldn't be much of a 
surprise: a "girlie" magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 "A girlie magazine with a lot of class," promises Flo Anthony, executive 
editor of Scandalous, set to bow in December as a monthly, with 1992 Playboy 
Playmate of the Year Stephanie Adams as the cover subject. 
</P>
<P>
 Named after Campbell's yacht, the publication is being pitched as a 
multicultural version of Playboy, with three centerfolds and contributions from 
such writers as comedian Paul Mooney, journalist-novelist Nelson George and CNN 
correspondent Jill Brooke. 
</P>
<P>
 Campbell will contribute a publisher's column and editorial overview. 
</P>
<P>
 "What people don't realize is he's really an intelligent and classy guy," 
Anthony says of the man known for such songs as "Me So Horny."  
</P>
<P>
 "The whole thing he does on records is a business thing." Bruce Haring

 In the 1990 Ernest Goes to Jail (NBC Sunday at 9 p.m.), Jim Varney's Ernest P. 
Worrell, that demented motor mouth, gets in trouble because of his resemblance 
to a look-alike deranged prison kingpin (also played by Varney). 
</P>
<P>
 Steven Spielberg's interminable 1989 Always (ABC Sunday at 9 p.m.) is an 
ill-advised remake of the 1943 "A Guy Named Joe." Richard Dreyfuss plays a 
flying ace who's killed but allowed by an angel (Audrey Hepburn) to come back 
to help a new pilot (Brad Johnson) become the hotshot he had been. Starring 
Holly Hunter as the pilots' shared love interest. 
</P>
<P>
 A teen-age girl's need for a bone marrow transplant and her mother's refusal 
to allow a younger brother to be a donor hurtles a family to the brink of 
destruction in the worthy 1992 Desperate Choices: To Save My Child (NBC Monday 
at 9 p.m.), which stars Reese Witherspoon, Bruce Davison and Joanna Kerns. 
</P>
<P>
 In Allie Light's warm and encouraging Dialogues With Madwomen (KCET Tuesday at 
10 p.m.), seven highly articulate women tell us their stories of enduring and 
eventually overcoming mental illness. 
</P>
<P>
 KCET is airing Wednesday at 7:30 p.m. Michael Wadleigh's Woodstock in the 
shorter, original release version (3 hours, 4 minutes). The landmark 
documentary-concert film is also available in a 4 1/2-hour version. 
</P>
<P>
 Although not without flaws, Blake Edwards' 1991 comedy Switch (KCOP Thursday 
at 8 p.m., Saturday at 6 p.m.) has a modern sense of confusion about sexual 
roles and social masks. The film tries to find a sense of responsibility -- or 
empathy or humanism -- in the midst of sexual chaos. Murdered by three 
infuriated mistresses, a callous, high-rolling New York ad executive (Perry 
King) is sent back to Earth as a woman (Ellen Barkin, whose scenes crackle with 
danger) to somehow redeem him/herself. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1987 Hamburger Hill (KCOP Friday at 8 p.m.) pays heartfelt, richly 
deserved tribute to one of the Vietnam War's bloodiest battles. However, it 
lapses into a preachy attack on the anti-war movement without ever questioning 
U.S. involvement in the war in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1980 Frank Sinatra ended a near-decade absence from the screen with The 
First Deadly Sin (KCOP Saturday at 8 p.m.), in which he played, with a fresh 
charge of passion and commitment. He plays a New York homicide detective with 
an adored, dying wife (Faye Dunaway) and who is on the verge of retirement when 
a maniac goes on a lethal rampage. This is solid, absorbing fare -- until its 
disturbing vigilante finish. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1993 TV Moment of Truth: Stalking Back (NBC Saturday at 9 p.m.) allows us 
to empathize with the plight of a family whose 14-yea-old daughter (Luanne 
Ponce) is stalked. But it doesn't take the risk of developing the character of 
the rather simple-minded misfit (Tom Kurlander) who becomes obsessed with her.

 Akiyoshi has had her share of triumphs over the past 20 years, but "Desert 
Lady" is unprecedented. This is a staggering achievement not only for her as 
composer, arranger and pianist, but also for Lew Tabackin as tenor saxophonist, 
flutist and composer.He wrote "Desert Lady" for one of his small group 
sessions; for this version Akiyoshi has expanded the work into a suite, and 
it's given a nonpareil performance that displays her large ensemble at a 
unified peak of excellence. 
</P>
<P>
 The other original works here, though less ambitious in scope, all reflect the 
leader's mastery of orchestral voicings. A unique aspect of the album is its 
inclusion of the only tune in the band's repertoire not written by her or 
Tabackin: "Bebop" is a tribute to its composer, Dizzy Gillespie, brilliantly 
updated yet retaining the spirit of the original. It includes poised and 
perfect solos by Greg Gisbert on trumpet and Jim Snidero on alto sax. 
</P>
<P>
 New to most listeners will be Akiyoshi's "Hangin' Loose," a fresh and 
fascinating reworking of the chords of "Mean to Me." And Tabackin's tenor is 
the centerpiece on "Harlequin Tears" and "Broken Dreams." 
</P>
<P>
 To sum up: a flawless, indispensable album. 
</P>
<P>
 Albums are rated on a scale of one star (poor), two stars (fair), three stars 
(good, recommended), four stars (excellent).

 In this dazzling 1970 film, Bernardo Bertolucci manages to combine the style 
of Fellini, the sense of period of Visconti and the political commitment of 
Elio Petri ("Investigation of a Private Citizen") with complete individuality 
and a total lack of self-indulgence. Adapted from an Alberto Moravia novel, the 
film is at once a study of one man and an entire society.Jean-Louis Trintignant 
(pictured) stars as a respected but troubled philosophy professor so determined 
to maintain his respectability that he's ripe for recruitment by a fascist 
espionage organization just as World War II draws near. (Bravo Monday at 5 and 
10 p.m.).

 Allen and Albert Hughes, the 21-year-old twin brothers who directed this 1993 
movie, along with 23-year-old screenwriter Tyger Williams, are young enough to 
get inside the loves of Watts gangbangers without making it seem as if we're 
watching something taking place on another planet.Their instincts as filmmakers 
override their instincts as moralizers. At the center of the film is a young 
man (Tyrin Turner, background), raised from childhood by his Bible-toting 
grandparents, who's on the verge of graduating from high school, proud of his 
gang affiliations but also proud he hasn't killed anybody -- yet. Jada Pinkett 
(pictured) plays his friend Ronnie (Showtime Sunday at 9:30 p.m.). Peter Rainer

CRITIC'S PICK: 'LIFE WITH MIKEY' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Peter Rainer

<TEXT>
<P>
 The main reason to see this 1993 release is for Michael J. Fox's all-out 
performance as a former child TV star who peaked at 15 and now runs a 
third-rate kids' talent agency. As Michael Chapman, Fox (right) has the haggard 
look of an actor who played out his childhood on television without ever having 
played it out in his own life.By doggedly running the talent agency with his 
brother (Nathan Lane) and their gum-popping secretary (Cyndi Lauper), Michael 
is, in a sense, trying to replay his childhood all over again -- but this time 
from the driver's seat. The film isn't as syrupy as it might be, mostly due to 
a 10-year-old (Christina Vidal, left) who shows up as the answer to the 
agency's dreams; she plays it spunky rather than twinkly (Showtime Monday at 
noon and 8 p.m.; Saturday at 4:45 p.m.). Peter Rainer

CRITIC'S PICK: 'THE MAN WITHOUT A FACE'

<TEXT>
<P>
 This film marked Mel Gibson's ambitious and largely successful directorial 
debut. It intelligently relates the relationship that develops, against 
considerable odds, between a 12-year-old boy (Nick Stahl, a wonderful actor) in 
need of a father as much as some tutoring, and a former prep school teacher 
(Gibson).The teacher has been a recluse for many years because the right side 
of his face was badly scarred by fire. As an actor and as a director, Gibson 
shines in the credible way in which he develops a pupil-and-teacher 
relationship and, in turn, a loving father-and-son relationship. Adapted by 
Malcolm MacRury from Isabelle Holland's novel, this 1993 film also observes how 
difficult it can be nowadays for a man and a boy who are unrelated to have a 
perfectly innocent, mutually nurturing friendship (HBO Tuesday at 11:30 a.m. 
and 8 p.m.). Kevin Thomas

WITH AN EYE ON . . . ; JOE TORRY PLANS TO ADD HIS OWN FLAVOR TO THE 'DEF COMEDY 
JAM' STAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS RUBIN, Chris Rubin is a Los Angeles-based free-lance writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The new host of HBO's "Russell Simmons' Def Comedy Jam" isn't out to remake 
the show, just move it forward. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'Comedy Jam' won't change much," says Joe Torry. "It's just a continuation, 
hipper, a new flavor. And," Torry adds with a laugh, "better looking." 
</P>
<P>
 "Def Comedy Jam" producer Russell Simmons caught Torry's act in a comedy club 
and promised him a spot based on the strength of that performance. Torry was 
such a hit with the "Jam" audience that Simmons soon decided to hire him to 
replace the departing host, Martin Lawrence. 
</P>
<P>
 Torry realizes he's got big shoes to fill in taking over the show. Lawrence, a 
manic comedian with a pliable, Gumby-like body, left his mark on the raucous 
comedy showcase. But Torry didn't feel worried about replacing him. No 
challenge could be greater, he believes, than when he jumped in at the Comedy 
Act Theater after the death of comedian Robin Harris, his friend and mentor. 
"That was harder than filling in for Martin." 
</P>
<P>
 "Martin's a more physical comedian than I am. I'm sort of just from the hip," 
Torry says. "I've been blessed, it just comes out funny when I get up and talk. 
Earthquakes, floods, the L.A.P.D. ... L.A. is pretty rough, it's jokes all 
around. Most of my material comes from pet peeves, what irks me, pisses me 
off." 
</P>
<P>
 Torry, who has done everything from semi-pro football to selling vacuum 
cleaners door to door, is very loose and fluid. As he walks out on stage, he 
unleashes a stream of four- and 12-letter obscenities that would, no doubt, 
solicit a "whooping" from his mother, were she in the audience. 
</P>
<P>
 His parents, who live in St. Louis, have seen his act live a couple of times. 
"They wish I didn't use so much profanity. I would have gotten a boot to the 
head if I cussed like that as a little kid. My father was strict, strict, 
strict." 
</P>
<P>
 An Army brat, with a drill-sergeant father and a school-teacher mother, Torry 
was born on a base in Virginia and grew up in a handful of cities around the 
country. He spent much of his youth in St. Louis with his three sisters and one 
brother. Yet despite his highly disciplined childhood, Torry turned into a 
quick-witted prankster. 
</P>
<P>
 Torry attended Lincoln University in Jefferson City, Mo., graduating with a 
degree in journalism. While writing for the school paper and acting as a deejay 
at the college station, he continued to hone his comic talents. Despite a 
handful of local job offers after graduation, Torry packed his bags into his 
'75 AMC Hornet and headed for L.A. in search of stardom. 
</P>
<P>
 The military was never a career option. "Not a chance in hell. Closest thing I 
thought about was being a cop. I can't stand taking orders like, 'Get down and 
give me 20.' I'm too much of an individual for that." 
</P>
<P>
 Though he's only been performing professionlly since moving here five years 
ago, he's been cracking people up as far back as he can remember. "I was the 
mischievous one, always in the doghouse. But I had good grades, so I could get 
away with being funny. 
</P>
<P>
 "My first role model was Sammy Davis Jr. He was the first person I saw who 
made me want to be an entertainer. When I found what my niche was -- comedy -- 
then I got into Richard Pryor, George Carlin and Eddie Murphy." 
</P>
<P>
 "Richard Pryor is like a god," Torry says reverently. "I would sneak around 
and listen to his albums. My father finally gave me a Richard Pryor album when 
I graduated college and moved to L.A." 
</P>
<P>
 Torry's ambitions include movies and more TV. "I knew at an early age I wanted 
to be in front of an audience. I can't sing too well, so comedy was it. The 
acting thing is what I'm trying to conquer now." 
</P>
<P>
 He's made appearances in the film "Poetic Justice" and the Fox series "Roc," 
and recently filmed a series of ads for Nike. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, he sees his "Def Comedy Jam" hosting job as a "baton to be 
passed on to someone else. I'd like to be too busy, making too much money, like 
Martin, to do the show."  
</P>
<P>
 "Russell Simmons' Def Comedy Jam" airs Fridays at midnight on HBO.

 When Jake Steinfeld was a teen-ager, he and his grandmother went to see 
"Pumping Iron" in a New York theater. "All during the movie, I kept wondering, 
'Where's Arnold?' " recalls Steinfeld, referring to the then-Mr. Olympia and 
his personal hero Arnold Schwarzenegger. 
</P>
<P>
 "Afterward, Arnold was in the lobby, and I shook his hand for what seemed like 
two hours. Then my grandma and I stood around and watched him talking to other 
people. She said, 'He's a regular guy. Go ask him your questions.' But I was 
too shy. Finally she took me over and said, 'My grandson wants to ask you 
something.' I blurted out, 'What do you do for your calves?' He told me, and he 
was very nice about it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Arnold was always bigger than life to me, although not any more. He did for 
bodybuilding what I hope I've done for personal training." 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Steinfeld, 36, has established himself as a fitness expert, partly 
because of his physique and partly because of his good-natured personality. His 
100-episode series "Big Brother Jake" runs daily on the Family Channel; his 
"Body by Jake" exercise series has airs on cable. And, most recently, he's 
developed a Cable Health Club program, segments of which air daily in Southern 
California on the Family Channel. 
</P>
<P>
 Steinfeld says he recently turned down an action series, but he's still 
looking at TV and film possibilities. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pacino and De Niro don't have to be worried," Steinfeld says with a laugh. 
"In fact, not a soul should worry. In the fitness industry I'm the guy, but in 
the acting world I'm still a beginner and I'm treated like that." 
</P>
<P>
 How did Steinfeld move from hiding behind his grandmother to heading a 
multimillion-dollar company? A combination of wishful thinking, luck and 
determination. 
</P>
<P>
 Flash back to young Steinfeld's boyhood on Long Island: "I was a fat kid with 
a terrible stutter. When I was 14, my father bought me a set of weights. It was 
summertime, and he called me out to the backyard to show me the bench press. I 
had Twinkies in my hand. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't touch the weights all summer. Fall came and my father asked me to 
put them in the basement, where I lived. Finally I decided that instead of 
studying, I'd try out the weights. All of a sudden, I stood up straighter, I 
cared about what I wore and girls began paying attention." 
</P>
<P>
 After graduation, Steinfeld went off to State University of New York College 
at Cortland to play lacrosse but quickly had a revelation. "I called home and 
told my mother, 'I'm going to California to be a bodybuilder,' " he says. "I 
heard her yelling, 'Herbie, pick up the phone. I'm putting my head in the 
oven.' There weren't a lot of Jewish bodybuilders, but in the end they 
supported me. I always knew if I failed I could go home." 
</P>
<P>
 But he didn't fail. After training for a year, Steinfeld came in second in the 
1979 Mr. Southern California contest. "I got a tiny orange plaque," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Steinfeld's father decided to take his eldest son under his wing. 
"My father was a salesman," Steinfeld says. "He published 'The Guide to Better 
Living,' which went to local real estate places. He came to Los Angeles, made 
me put on a shirt and tie and took me with him on sales calls. He bought me 
lunch for two weeks, which was great because I didn't have any dough. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then he said it was my turn to go out. He sent me to a florist to try to sell 
him a back cover for $600. Unbeknownst to me, he called the florist and told 
him, 'Give the kid a hard time but take the ad.' I went in, asked him if he 
wanted an ad, he said 'no,' and I said, 'OK,' and left." 
</P>
<P>
 His sales career at an end, Steinfeld got a job on the Universal Studios Tour, 
playing one of the Incredible Hulks. "I was in green paint for 14 hours a day 
until the TV show was canceled," he says. "Then I was catching rays outside my 
apartment when a friend of a friend (actress Sandra Will) asked me to help get 
her in shape for an audition. 
</P>
<P>
 "I went to her boyfriend's house and improvised workouts with broomsticks and 
towels instead of dumbbells. We kept it fun, and I injected my personality into 
it." The results were quickly apparent. 
</P>
<P>
 "She went to parties and talked about this guy who came to her house and 
helped her work out. No one did this. I had an unlisted phone number. If people 
can't get hold of you, they want you more. Soon I was hearing from Harrison 
Ford, Teri Garr, Bette Midler, Warren Beatty and George Lucas." 
</P>
<P>
 Steinfeld soon realized the business potential. He formed a company, Body by 
Jake, and hired his twin brothers to help him as trainers. "I had a terrific 
relationship with some of the most influential people in Hollywood," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "I met Steven Spielberg when 'E.T.' was up for an Academy Award, and I trained 
him for 10 years. He used to let me sit in on budget meetings at his house. 
Here I was with these people. They're no different from us, but they had dreams 
and didn't take 'no' for an answer." 
</P>
<P>
 Neither did Steinfeld. He parlayed his house calls into a whole new industry: 
personal training. Ted Turner read about him in People magazine and asked him 
to develop one-minute fitness breaks for CNN. Then, in 1988, he developed his 
own syndicated TV series, "Body by Jake." 
</P>
<P>
 Two years later, "Big Brother Jake," Steinfeld's show about a guy who is a Big 
Brother to five foster children in a Brooklyn home, began running on the Family 
Channel. Now, having completed the final episodes, he is concentrating 
full-time on his Cable Health Club, which is owned by International Family 
Entertainment Inc., in conjunction with Body by Jake Inc. (The network, which 
offers continuous programming about exercise and healthy living, is not yet 
being offered by Southern California cable systems, however.) 
</P>
<P>
 His only regret is that his grandmother died before seeing his success. "She 
used to shoot hoops with us," he says. "She was a character. She'd bring pizza 
over on Yom Kippur." 
</P>
<P>
 And for those shy wanna-be muscleheads who don't have pushy grandmothers, he 
has this piece of advice: "Buy extra-small T-shirts and learn not to breathe." 
</P>
<P>
 "Big Brother Jake" airs weekdays at midnight and Saturday at 11:30 a.m. on the 
Family Channel; the Cable Health Club airs weekdays at 6-7 a.m. and 2:30-3 p.m. 
on the Family Channel, with "Body by Jake" at 6:30 a.m.

RETRO; RASCAL FEVER

<P>
 "The Little Rascals" are hot. 
</P>
<P>
 Universal just premiered its new feature film based on producer Hal Roach's 
beloved comedy shorts of the 1920s, '30s and '40s. And now there's the release 
of Cabin Fever Home Video's 12-volume collection of classic "Rascals" featuring 
the original "Our Gang" stars: Spanky, Darla, Alfalfa, Butch, Buckwheat and 
Pete the dog. ("When Roach sold 100 episodes of the "Our Gang" comedies to 
television in 1955, they were renamed "The Little Rascals" because MGM owned 
the rights to the title "Our Gang.") 
</P>
<P>
 Each $15 volume in the video set contains four episodes. Included in the 
collection is the 1936 Oscar-winning short "Board of Education." 
</P>
<P>
 Tommy Bond, who in the '30s played the bully Rascal called Butch, is thrilled 
fans can see the newly restored episodes on video. "They're marvelous," he 
says. "They're perfectly preserved. They look like they did when they first 
came out in the theaters." 
</P>
<P>
 Bond, 68, also recently published his autobiography "Darn Right It's Butch" 
(Morgan Press). "It's about Hollywood as seen through the eyes of a 
6-year-old," Bond says. 
</P>
<P>
 Bond was all of 6 and living in Dallas when he was spotted by a Hal Roach 
talent scout while walking down the street with his parents. "He said (to my 
parents): 'He has got a great face, a terrific nose. I think Hal Roach would be 
interested in talking to him about being in the 'Our Gang' comedies. I can't 
guarantee you anything, but if you bring him to California, I can guarantee a 
meeting with Hal Roach.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Because his parents couldn't leave their jobs, Bond's grandmother brought him 
to Hollywood for the audition. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess I lucked out. I had natural talent. I was in 12 or 13 'Our Gangs' as 
the character Tommy. But then for some reason or another they dropped my 
contract. I went to other studios and did other things and then three years 
later they brought me back as the new tough kid on the block, Butch. That's the 
part most people remember." 
</P>
<P>
 Being a member of the "Gang," Bond says with a laugh, "was awesome. You know, 
to throw you into a sound stage with lights and cameras and all sorts of 
people. ... it's a different life, but it was fun. I enjoyed it." 
</P>
<P>
 While he was under contract, Bond attended school on the Roach lot. "If you 
were not working in the movies, you went to school every day for three hours. 
Mrs. Carter was our teacher. When you were on the set, you had to have three 
hours of school within an eight-hour day." 
</P>
<P>
 When he wasn't working or going to school, Bond would observe movies being 
made on the lot. "I saw them shoot 'Topper' with Cary Grant and Constance 
Bennett. They were also shooting 'Babes in Toyland' with Laurel and Hardy. I 
was fortunate enough to work with Laurel and Hardy in 'Block-heads.' Those were 
exciting times. Hollywood was an entirely different place then. It wasn't the 
factory that it is today. Everything was fun and if they went over budget, they 
went over budget. They were interested in the finished product. 
</P>
<P>
 The late Spanky McFarland, who played the group's pudgy leader Spanky, once 
told Bond why he thought the series had endured for so many decades. "Spanky 
made the statement: 'We did it right.' And when you think about it, I guess 
it's true. We were kids in the age of innocence. We were in the Depression. We 
didn't have a lot. I think part of the secret was that we were just simple kids 
doing our thing. Roach knew how to pick the kids. He had a real Midas touch as 
far as the type of kids he used in the 'Gang.' He even turned Shirley Temple 
down three or four times. The reason why was, he wasn't looking for pretty boys 
or pretty girls. He was looking for characters." 
</P>
<P>
 After his "Our Gang" days were over when he was 12, Bond attended public 
school. "I wanted a normal childhood. What I didn't like were private schools. 
All the kids who were going to private schools, all they did was talk about the 
business. I just wanted to be an ordinary kid, so I went on to public school. I 
enjoyed it very much. Or course, I had to fight every day because they thought 
every kid in the movies was a sissy. So you had to prove that you weren't. They 
were testing my toughness." 
</P>
<P>
 As a young adult, Bond played Jimmy Olson in two 1948 "Superman" serials. "We 
made one serial in four weeks, which is equivalent to three features in four 
weeks," he says. "We did as many as 103 scenes in Perry White's office in one 
day. It was hectic!"

 Bond, who attended Los Angeles City College and California State University, 
Los Angeles, quit acting in 1951. "It was my own choice. I went into television 
production so I was in the early days of TV. I stayed with TV until about two 
years ago, when I retired. I loved the business, but as an actor you wait for 
your agent to call. If you work two or three months out of the year, you are 
real lucky.!"

THAT DARN KATZENBERG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As a reasonably obsessive movie fan, one who collects movie memories (as 
opposed to memorabilia), I had a bit of a brainstorm upon reading Claudia Eller 
and Alan Citron's story " Angst at Disney's World" (July 24), and I began to 
flip through my list of movies I've seen since childhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Eisner and Jeffrey Katzenberg's problem is simply megalomania. Every 
big, stupid live-action film they do at Disney has to be bigger and stupider 
than the last. When I was a kid, you would have had to drag me kicking and 
screaming to see "Newsies." 
</P>
<P>
 But when was the last time these marketing geniuses (and creative novices) 
gave us something as sweet and simple as "That Darn Cat"? Or "The Ugly 
Dachshund"? Or "The Shaggy Dog," "The Absent-Minded Professor," "Mary Poppins," 
"Bedknobs and Broomsticks," "Freaky Friday," "The Million Dollar Duck," "The 
Shaggy D.A.," "The Love Bug" or "Song of the South"? We gladly stood in line to 
see these movies 20 years ago and more. 
</P>
<P>
 While it may be true that kids today are smarter and more sophisticated, maybe 
it's because they have no choice. Their parents are dragging them to 
"Schindler's List" to show them the harsh realities of the real world, but they 
never get a chance to escape to Witch Mountain. The solution is not "high 
concepts." It is a return to the same innocence about which we're all so 
cynical, the innocence that's currently making adults and children alike fall 
in love with a flatulent wart hog who doesn't like to worry. 
</P>
<P>
 As for Eisner, if my figures are correct, he made as much last year as the 
average hard-working career man or woman makes in 82 lifetimes. And four weeks 
ago he had to have four bypasses? My advice is get out now and enjoy what 
you've got.

THOUSAND FACES, TWO LEGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gary Sinise is a lucky fellow ("More 'Gump' Effects -- The Gary Sinise 
Illusion," Film Clips, July 10). He had all the advantages of special effects 
and computer graphics to help him appear as an amputee. He's very fortunate 
compared to what Lon Chaney went through when he played a double amputee. 
</P>
<P>
 In "The Penalty" (1920, Goldwyn Pictures), Chaney played Blizzard, the legless 
ruler of San Francisco's underworld. Without the aid of computers or even trick 
photography, Chaney devised a set of leather stumps that allowed him to 
actually walk on his knees. He first strapped his legs behind him, then donned 
an oversized pair of pants, which looked more like a large pair of shorts. He 
then placed his legs into the leather stumps, which had a strap running 
lengthwise up the legs and attaching to a belt around his waist. A padded chest 
piece (to give a fuller appearance to the upper torso) and an oversized jacket 
completed the effect. 
</P>
<P>
 Chaney was able to wear this device for only 10 minutes at a time and then 
would require his legs to be massaged. His grandson, Lon Ralph Chaney, told me 
that Chaney would wear this device around the house for weeks before filming, 
practicing the things he would do in the film. Hazel Chaney, the actor's widow, 
said the producers added a scene at the end of the picture when it was 
originally released to prove that Chaney was not an amputee nor was he doubled 
by one. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the effect of Chaney as an amputee is still very startling when the film 
is viewed 74 years later. And, like Sinise's performance, Chaney's work is 
still riveting. Despite the physical effect, his performance still dominates 
the picture.

DANCE OF DIVERSITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Regarding "A Look at the Rolodex of Dance," Jan Breslauer's article on the 
"Dance Kaleidoscope" festival (July 24): 
</P>
<P>
 Bravo to the efforts of keeping dance in view and its diverse viewpoints. In 
an already divided dance community, it is important to keep both sides of 
dialogues open with hopes that one day we can all merge as strong ambassadors 
that represent all cultural aesthetics of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Since my name was brought up unnecessarily and for self-serving purposes by 
Frank Guevara, I feel I must respond as a Latino choreographer and artistic 
director, who has been through the ropes of auditioning for this event seven 
times and taken only once into the programming, and has served for two years as 
a panelist for the "Dance Kaleidoscope." 
</P>
<P>
 My art is by far the most important single element in my life; artistic merit 
and integrity surpasses skin color. That I happen to be of Mexican American 
background, of which I am extremely proud, simply reflects my underlying pulse 
by which my works come to life on a global sense, rather than limited to 
immediate territory and fad. As an artist I'd rather be known by the caliber of 
my work instead of the color of my skin. 
</P>
<P>
 Going through the process of auditioning can be discouraging for anyone, 
especially when six out of the seven times that I auditioned I was turned down. 
I thought of all the things that could go wrong, but never did I feel 
discriminated against because of my ethnic background. 
</P>
<P>
 I find the use of this excuse by any ethnic group passe and insulting to the 
rest of us who are serious about our mission as artists. Life is too short, 
life is even shorter these days to some, and the more we dwell on what is wrong 
with everyone, the less we get to where we need to get.

 Although there are several comments I would like to contest, I would like to 
say that Frank Guevara's statements are unfounded. 
</P>
<P>
 He states that the auditioning process was "insulting." I was there at the 
presentation and even helped him with his props. What he showed as a work was 
really "insulting"; prancing around with a tire, large concrete brick and a 
link fence does not make for a controversial work. 
</P>
<P>
 Guevara has been well-supported by The Times' dance critics, and I feel it has 
gone to his head. Frank, where is that good old Hispanic integrity? And how 
about a good dose of humbleness?

WOODSTOCK REDUX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It is perplexing that the commercialization of Woodstock ("Deja Vu All Over 
Again," by Chuck Crisafulli, with related articles by Lorraine Ali and Steve 
Hochman, July 24) is a sore point, when that concern should have been addressed 
a year or two after the original event. 
</P>
<P>
 There is not too much being made of the anniversary of the concert -- it 
changed musical history and should not be forgotten. The ideals espoused did 
not directly change the world (and weren't all good), but they should not be 
allowed to quietly expire, as they once were. The point is to remember the 
original vision and not what the media and Madison Avenue have parlayed it 
into. 
</P>
<P>
 In any case, there is no way that the original experience can be repeated in 
an entirely different social climate. The real glory of Woodstock was in the 
mere searching . 
</P>
<P>
 It was an inspiring occurrence, but in the end was really only a catalyst 
necessary in the same way as Elvis and the Beatles were, especially in the wake 
of their breakup. But the main drawback to Woodstock was that it helped 
escalate the pay scale for rock 'n' roll -- even though some artists are worth 
it -- and thereby caused too many people to enter the music business for all 
the wrong reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 FRANK BEESON 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 I would like to take exception to Lorraine Ali's comments in her commentary 
"Lollapaloozer to Hippola: Give It a Rest, Will Ya?" that "the '60s are alive 
-- and more bloated and self-important than ever." 
</P>
<P>
 First of all, she means to say "the late '60s," which bore very little 
cultural resemblance to, say, 1962. But more important, as one who lived 
through the Woodstock era, I can assure Ali that the '60s were just as bloated 
and self-important then as they are now. That's why the music of that period, 
for example, has aged so badly.

DEVELOPERS RUSHING TO GET DIBS ON SPECTACULAR NORTH BAJA COAST; MEXICO: CONDOS 
AND RESORTS ARE MULTIPLYING. OFTEN, BUYERS ARE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIANS SEEKING 
BETTER VALUE AND CHANGE OF SCENERY. 
</P>

<P>
 Great natural splendor unfolds as Route 1 runs south from San Diego down the 
Baja California coastline. Soaring jet-black lava cliffs drop to the 
sun-dappled Pacific Ocean. Bronze pastures slope to meet the road. 
</P>
<P>
 Some call it one of the world's last great coastlines. 
</P>
<P>
 But something else, something much less organic, is starting to fill out the 
45 miles from the border city of Tijuana to the port city of Ensenada: 
High-rise condominiums and resorts, and banners announcing "Models Open" and 
"Now Showing." 
</P>
<P>
 Encouraged by the loosening of Mexican foreign investment laws and improved 
cooperation between the United States and Mexico, developers are rushing to get 
dibs on their piece of Baja Norte. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's bearing more fruit than anything that's happening in the U.S.," said 
Jerry Trammer, general manager of a Palm Springs developer putting up 320 homes 
in Baja. 
</P>
<P>
 In many cases, developers are selling to Southern Californians who come south 
seeking better value and a change of scenery. 
</P>
<P>
 Buyers are tempted by names like Real Del Mar. Playa Blanca. Playa Del Mar. 
The Grand Baja Resort. Club Morena. La Paloma. An employee at the Tijuana 
tourism office says he can't keep track of all the projects that have sprung up 
in the Tijuana-Ensenada corridor, where 20,000 foreigners now live. 
</P>
<P>
 For a glimpse of the future, consider Bajamar, a 1,600-acre "megadevelopment" 
with its own highway exit. 
</P>
<P>
 Bajamar has been around since 1974, but for many of those years it sat fallow, 
its buildings dilapidated. Along came Grupo Situr, a Mexican developer known 
for large-scale resorts, with $170 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Grupo Situr has bold plans. By 1997, Bajamar will have more than 2,300 homes, 
two 18-hole golf courses, movie production studios, a health clinic, a 
supermarket, two artificial lakes, tennis courts and an equestrian center. 
</P>
<P>
 Sales to developers and home buyers are expected to generate $1.5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Four years ago, Pat and John Loukmas, who made their money in the Southern 
California hotel and restaurant business, ordered the home of their dreams at 
Bajamar -- a split-level Mediterranean model with stone lions guarding the 
entrance and a courtyard with a fountain and native banana trees, queen palms, 
yuccas and agave. Villa Poseidon, they call it. 
</P>
<P>
 Pat Loukmas, an artist and aerobics instructor, has a fondness for Mexico born 
of many trips there. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people just think of the dirt in Tijuana," she said. "They don't 
think of the beautiful areas farther south." 
</P>
<P>
 It's not just the affluent buying homes in Baja. While Bajamar says its 
clients are mostly middle- to upper-management types investing in weekend 
homes, houses start at $175,000 -- a bargain by Southern California standards. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the middle class -- schoolteachers, for example -- who feel "our 
money is not going very far (in the U.S.) these days" are making the move, said 
Paul Vanderwood, a San Diego State University professor. 
</P>
<P>
 Baja California's Pacific coast extends about 800 miles from the gritty and 
growing Tijuana to the playgrounds of Cabo San Lucas. But most of the land in 
between is still virgin territory, owned by small farmers and farm 
cooperatives. 
</P>
<P>
 Building in Baja isn't a guarantee of success. 
</P>
<P>
 Route 1 long ago earned the nickname "Highway of Broken Dreams," a reflection 
of numerous projects gone belly-up, said David G. Ellsworth, a 20-year adviser 
to U.S. and Mexican real-estate ventures. 
</P>
<P>
 Even today, unoccupied shells are a monument to developers who couldn't raise 
the capital to finish their work. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of the projects have been started by people with just enough money to 
build a gate -- a fancy gate -- and buy some brochures," said Ellsworth. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of those that did get off the ground were poorly designed and bereft of 
amenities, Ellsworth and others say. Even their streets weren't well 
thought-out. That's why people stayed away. 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, demand remains high for the sort of the master-planned, 
ultra-luxurious resort developments that are more common these days, they say, 
and any talk of a housing glut along the north coast is premature. 
</P>
<P>
 Seminars held in U.S. cities are widely attended by top builders, contractors 
and investors. Meanwhile, the Mexican government is trying to win foreign 
investors with new roads and an easing of formerly prohibitive regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 Between 1917 -- the year of the Mexican Constitution -- and 1973, foreign 
investors had no legal way to own land in a "prohibited zone" of prime border 
and coastal land 100 kilometers (about 62 miles) or less from the border, and 
50 kilometers or less from the coastline. That has changed, with the greatest 
momentum coming in the last few years. 
</P>
<P>
 Baja's infrastructure has not kept pace with the country's courting of foreign 
investors. Baja still relies on propane gas rather than natural gas, and phone 
lines are being installed piecemeal. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to remember this is still a Third World country. The whole thing is 
not quite up to the standards we all enjoy in the U.S.," said Stuart Ripley, 
president of a Century 21 real estate office in Rosarito Beach. "But it's 
reliable."

VIETNAM'S FARMERS BOOST PRODUCTIVITY; ECONOMY: NOW THAT THE GOVERNMENT ALLOWS 
RICE TO BE GROWN PRIVATELY, THERE IS MORE INCENTIVE TO WORK HARDER. RURAL 
COOPERATIVES ARE BEING DISMANTLED.

 Chu Thi Nguyet, 19, stood in a corner of the flooded rice paddy, loose-fitting 
trousers soaked to the knee. 
</P>
<P>
 Mud sucked at her bare feet as she bent over a row of rice seedlings, a thin 
strip of pale green in the otherwise empty field. With a quick, rhythmic sweep 
of her left arm, she pulled one seedling after another from a bundle in her 
right hand and plugged them into the mud. 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond the earthen dikes separating her plot from others, the bare heads and 
conical hats of neighbors bobbed up and down. The farmers of Tan Cao village, 
65 miles south of Hanoi, were planting their summer-autumn rice even before 
harvesting the last of the winter-spring crop. 
</P>
<P>
 The villagers shouted and laughed as they worked. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes we joke together about what we did last night. Sometimes we argue 
about where the boundaries are between our plots," Nguyet said, taking a 
moment's rest. 
</P>
<P>
 In the new free market of Vietnamese agriculture, some farmers try to enlarge 
their own plots by moving boundary dikes, she explained. 
</P>
<P>
 Tan Cao is in Ninh Binh province on the southern edge of the Red River delta, 
Vietnam's second-largest rice producer after the Mekong delta in the south. 
</P>
<P>
 Vietnam harvested a bumper rice crop in June and July. Improved pest control 
and higher-yield varieties were part of the reason, but most important was the 
incentive to work harder since the government began in 1986 to dismantle rural 
cooperatives and allow private farming. 
</P>
<P>
 The economic revolution has helped Vietnam, which could not feed itself in 
1988, to become the third-ranking rice exporter after Thailand and the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were hungry when we worked for the cooperative," said Pham Van Quoc, 60, 
of Van Lam, a village near Tan Cao. "Now our productivity is 10 times what it 
used to be." 
</P>
<P>
 After a lifetime of farming, Quoc said, he finally has become enthusiastic 
about it: "I work much harder than before because now the results of our work 
belong to us." 
</P>
<P>
 Getting the rice from field to village for threshing is the hardest part, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Quoc uses a battered Chinese bicycle with homemade bamboo flaps on either side 
that, fully loaded, nearly disappears beneath a mound of rice stalks weighing 
about 330 pounds. He said younger men move loads half again as large. 
</P>
<P>
 "Three years ago, a flood covered all the fields, and insects destroyed both 
crops the next year," said Le Thi Trung, 26, of Dam Khe village, about a mile 
west of Tan Cao. "Farmers here were desperate. To survive, they went into the 
forest to look for wood to sell to other villages and districts to survive." 
</P>
<P>
 Like most farmers in the area, Trung and her family eat the rice they grow and 
have little or none left to sell. 
</P>
<P>
 Her family usually has two meals a day of rice, home-grown vegetables and pork 
or chicken obtained by barter. Some rich farmers can afford a midday meal, 
Trung said. 
</P>
<P>
 She and her neighbors spend 10 or 12 hours a day in the fields, starting at 6 
a.m. They sometimes gather after dinner to watch one of the village's two 
television sets, but often are too tired even for that.

ETCH A SKETCH MASTERPIECE A KEEPER, BUT DON'T JIGGLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By from Associated Press

<TEXT>
<P>
 The work by a big-name artist is rather linear in style, maybe a bit 
two-dimensional. It could also disappear with one good shake. 
</P>
<P>
 The 9-year-old drawing by Elaine de Kooning was done on an Etch A Sketch. 
</P>
<P>
 De Kooning is the late artist, critic and wife of painter Willem de Kooning. 
And Etch A Sketch is the quickly erasable, two-knobbed drawing board that has 
gotten countless families with children through countless long car rides. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1985, an art gallery in Sag Harbor celebrated Etch A Sketch's 25th birthday 
with a drawing contest for Long Island artists. Diane Deger, who owned the 
Parasol Gallery, recently found De Kooning's entry lying flat in a box filled 
with items from the gallery. 
</P>
<P>
 It was signed "E de K," in the corner, like all of her work. An attached note 
warned, "Please Do Not Move," since even standing it up would affect the 
sketch. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was an image of two elephants under a tree by a pool of water," Deger 
said. "It's got nice broken lines. It's really very good." 
</P>
<P>
 But not good enough to win the contest. That honor went to a nightclub singer 
named Phoebe LeJaire, possibly because her drawing of whales was deemed more 
fitting for Long Island. 
</P>
<P>
 An expert Deger consulted said the De Kooning sketch has no commercial value, 
but she considers it a great memento. As long as the drawing doesn't disappear. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a way to make the drawing permanent," she said, and she's contacted 
Ohio Art, maker of Etch A Sketch, to find exactly how. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, she said, "I hope I don't drop it."

20 YEARS AFTER NIXON'S RESIGNATION, SCANDAL STILL INTRIGUES U.S.; WATERGATE: 
WHITE HOUSE CALLED BREAK-IN AT DEMOCRATIC HEADQUARTERS "A THIRD-RATE BURGLARY," 
BUT IT BROUGHT DOWN THE PRESIDENT AND HIS MEN.

 At one end of the Watergate exhibit in the Richard Nixon Library and 
Birthplace, a wall-sized photo mural speaks volumes about the most famous 
resignation in history. It shows Nixon as he boarded the helicopter that took 
him into exile, arms outstretched in his trademark victory salute and an 
incongruous smile on his face. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, it will be 20 years since that tense Friday when Nixon ended two 
years of scheming to preserve his presidency. He went to his grave last April, 
never groveling, as he put it, having conceded only the mistakes of not setting 
a high enough standard for the people who worked for him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I should have established a moral tone that would have made such actions 
unthinkable," Nixon said. "I did not. I played by the rules of politics as I 
found them. . . . For that reason, I long ago accepted overall responsibility 
for the Watergate affair." 
</P>
<P>
 He dismissed Watergate as "one part wrongdoing, one part blundering, and one 
part political vendetta," and as "a tragedy of errors." His resignation was 
simply "one major defeat in a career that involved both victories and losses, 
both peaks and valleys." 
</P>
<P>
 Of those who were not satisfied -- and there were many -- Nixon said, "If they 
want me to get down and grovel on the floor, no. Never." 
</P>
<P>
 On Aug. 8, 1974, in a television speech announcing his resignation effective 
at noon the next day, Nixon told the American people: "I have never been a 
quitter. To leave office before my term is completed is opposed to every 
instinct in my body. But as President I must put the interests of America 
first." 
</P>
<P>
 That was both truth and evasion. Truth: The country was mesmerized and numbed 
by the biggest political scandal in its history and the government was 
paralyzed. Evasion: Nixon left because the hot wind of certain impeachment made 
his survival impossible. 
</P>
<P>
 He recalled the moment of departure as "a frame of film forever frozen" -- 
someone waving a white handkerchief from the window of the Lincoln bedroom, the 
flag on top of the White House hanging limp "in the windless, cheerless 
morning," the noise of the chopper's engines that grew until it blotted out 
thought, Pat Nixon saying to no one in particular, "It's so sad. It's so sad." 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty years have passed. Other government scandals have come and gone, as 
they always do, but none had the staying power of Watergate. 
</P>
<P>
 Tourists still flock to the Watergate complex to be photographed where it 
began. The story is retold regularly in new books; the Library of Congress 
lists 222 titles that include the word "Watergate," and there are hundreds more 
about the scandal that don't. For example: John Dean's "Blind Ambition," H. R. 
Haldeman's "Haldeman Diaries," Judge John Sirica's "To Set the Record 
Straight." 
</P>
<P>
 The Nixon Library in Yorba Linda, Calif., where the anniversary is scarcely a 
cause for celebration, has scheduled "a firsthand account of RN's last 28 days 
at the White House from a man who was there," Nixon aide Frank Gannon. 
</P>
<P>
 A five-part television series on the Discovery Channel revisits Watergate by 
allowing some of the chief players, including John Ehrlichman, Haldeman and 
Dean to spin the tale once again with the perspective of history. 
</P>
<P>
 The extraordinary Nixon interviews with David Frost are being shown again, as 
fresh today as they were in 1977, when Nixon insisted, "I did not, in my view, 
commit an impeachable offense." 
</P>
<P>
 And love him or hate him, 3 1/2 months after his death, Richard Nixon 
continues to fascinate Americans. One measure is the number of visitors to his 
grave, 55 feet from his birthplace in Yorba Linda. The Nixon Library says it 
expects nearly a million people by the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nixon was a large figure. He had large ambitions; he had intense hatreds," 
Leonard Garment, Nixon's White House Watergate lawyer, said at a Discovery 
Channel symposium in connection with its series. 
</P>
<P>
 "He had tremendous flaws. His presidency and, in a sense, Watergate, was a way 
in which he could exorcise the tremendous demons of hatred that had accumulated 
over the years and which he, himself, had been both the perpetrator and the 
recipient of an immense amount of political abuse." 
</P>
<P>
 Those are the words of a friend. Others are less kind. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nothing happened that Richard Nixon didn't OK, nothing, and it's preposterous 
to think that anything of the magnitude of a break-in of the Democratic 
National Committee headquarters didn't come from Richard Nixon," said Alexander 
Butterfield, a top Nixon White House aide who disclosed the existence of a 
taping system. "Preposterous. It could not happen. I would stake my life on 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 Nixon's slide to disaster began after midnight on June 17, 1972, when five men 
were arrested in the Democratic Party headquarters on the 6th floor of the 
Watergate office building. 
</P>
<P>
 It was, in White House terms, "a third-rate burglary," but it held more 
serious terrors for the President's men. A year before, four of the burglars 
had helped ransack the office of the Beverly Hills psychiatrist treating Daniel 
Ellsberg; the fifth was a former CIA agent working for Nixon's reelection 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
 The trail quickly led to the leaders of the burglary team, G. Gordon Liddy and 
E. Howard Hunt, who had been hired by the White House to trace leaks of 
sensitive information -- thus the name, White House plumbers -- and who were in 
charge of political intelligence for the Committee to Reelect the President, or 
CREEP. 
</P>
<P>
 If Nixon had disavowed their actions, cut them loose, his involvement would 
have ended there. Instead, he approved steps to divert an FBI investigation for 
fear that their actions in the Ellsberg break-in would become known. Ellsberg 
had leaked the Pentagon Papers, a study of the origins of the Vietnam War. 
</P>
<P>
 From that inauspicious start began Nixon's inexorable march to disgrace. 
</P>
<P>
 The cast was staggering. John Mitchell -- Nixon's friend, former law partner 
and attorney general -- had discussed the burglary and given it his OK; top 
aide Charles Colson was implicated in pushing for intelligence; Haldeman and 
Ehrlichman, Nixon's top assistants, were involved in the cover-up. So was Dean, 
his counsel. All were among the 11 Nixon people who served time in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Nixon, named by a federal grand jury as one of 18 unindicted co-conspirators, 
did not. He received "a full, free and absolute pardon" from his successor, 
President Gerald R. Ford. 
</P>
<P>
 "Next to the resignation," Nixon said, "accepting the pardon was the most 
painful decision of my political career."

BABY JESSICA TAKES TO NEW LIFE, NEW NAME; ADOPTION: FAMILY SAYS 3-YEAR-OLD ANNA 
SCHMIDT IS ADJUSTING WELL A YEAR AFTER HER BIRTH PARENTS REGAINED CUSTODY FROM 
HER ADOPTIVE PARENTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 When the public knew her as Baby Jessica, she was a terrified little girl, 
screaming and crying as she was carried away from the only home she had ever 
known after a bitter custody fight. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the dark-eyed, dark-haired youngster says she's Anna, not Jessica. She has 
a new home with a sister and swings and a watchful dog. 
</P>
<P>
 And she has new interests. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can tell you, she does like to shop. She likes to shop and so does her Aunt 
Rob. Whenever we are together we go shopping -- McDonald's and shopping. Anna 
loves chicken nuggets with French fries and lots of ketchup," said Robbie 
Schmidt, the girl's aunt. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can guarantee you she's doing fine. She's wonderful. As far as Anna is 
concerned, she is Anna Jacqueline Schmidt and she will tell you that. That is 
her identity. If we've ever been out in public and maybe someone has come up 
and called her Jessica, she has informed them, 'My name is Anna Jacqueline 
Schmidt,' and she often wonders why they call her that." 
</P>
<P>
 On Aug. 2, 1993, Baby Jessica was transferred under court order from the home 
of Jan and Roberta DeBoer of Ann Arbor, Mich., to birth parents Dan and Cara 
Schmidt, who renamed her Anna Jacqueline Schmidt. 
</P>
<P>
 The couples had battled over the little girl for more than two years in Iowa 
and Michigan courts -- a fight that polarized the country over the issues of 
children's rights, birth parents' rights and adoptive parents' rights. 
</P>
<P>
 Cara Schmidt, then unmarried, gave birth to the little girl in Cedar Rapids, 
Iowa, on Feb. 8, 1991, and gave her daughter up for adoption. But she named the 
wrong man as father. 
</P>
<P>
 The DeBoers were granted custody, but on March 8 they learned Cara had gone to 
court to get her baby back. Then Dan Schmidt identified himself as the baby's 
father and sued to win custody. He and Cara married on April 11, 1992. The 
DeBoers fought for custody through courts in Iowa and Michigan. The U.S. 
Supreme Court rejected their pleas. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, in the frenzy of her transfer from the DeBoers to the Schmidts, scores 
of reporters and cameramen crowded around 29-month-old Jessica, catching her 
screams and tears. 
</P>
<P>
 "Coming out of that house and with all the turmoil in the house and all the 
camera people outside, that's what sent her crying," Robbie Schmidt said. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, other than appearances on ABC-TV's "PrimeTime Live" program in 
March and again last month, the Schmidts have avoided the media. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberta DeBoer, however, has written a book about the custody battle and is 
promoting it through interviews. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dan and Cara will not respond," said Robbie Schmidt, Dan's sister. "They feel 
it is not to Anna's best interest to exploit her in the media. They feel the 
only chance for Anna to have a normal life is for the press to just leave her 
and them alone." 
</P>
<P>
 That sentiment is echoed around Blairstown, a community of 695 people in 
eastern Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why don't you just get out of their faces and leave them alone?" a woman at 
Opie's Other Place tavern asked a reporter. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last year, you couldn't walk outside without having a reporter in your face. 
The reporters were reporting on the reporters," said Ann Morrow, who operates 
an ice cream parlor. 
</P>
<P>
 The Schmidts have moved from a tiny house on the edge of town to a bigger, 
more secluded home a few miles south of Blairstown. A big, black dog guards the 
house. A "No Trespassing" sign is posted. 
</P>
<P>
 A swing set and small jungle gym sit in the front yard for Anna and her 
13-month-old sister, Chloe. 
</P>
<P>
 "She adores Chloe. She adores her mom and dad, her grandmas, her grandpas, her 
aunts, her uncles," Robbie Schmidt said. "She puts her hands on my face and 
she'll tell me, 'Aunt Rob, you know you're my favorite aunt, don't you?' And 
I'll say, 'You bet, Anna Banana, and you're my favorite niece.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Anna and her parents are adjusting to their new life, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our lives are going to go on. The media attention is not important for us at 
this time. What's important to us is the fact that she is home and it's 
wonderful."

PREVIOUSLY UNPUBLISHED ITEMS OFFER INSIGHT INTO LIZZIE BORDEN SLAYINGS; CRIME: 
MORE THAN A HUNDRED YEARS BEFORE THE O.J. SIMPSON CASE, THE BORDEN FAMILY 
MURDERS HAD IT ALL -- A LOVED ONE ON TRIAL, COMPETING NEWS LEAKS, THE BEST 
DEFENSE TEAM MONEY COULD BUY. 
</P>

<P>
 A vicious double murder. A loved one charged. Sensational pretrial publicity. 
Competing news leaks. Gavel-to-gavel coverage. The best defense team money 
could buy. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lizzie Borden case had it all -- a century before O.J. Simpson. Even a 
children's rhyme has endured. 
</P>
<P>
 A new book shows just how much Americans got caught up in the Aug. 4, 1892, 
murders of Borden's prosperous father and stepmother in their Fall River home. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Commonwealth of Massachusetts vs. Lizzie A. Borden: The Knowlton Papers 
1892-1893," available this month, is a collection of more than 300 previously 
unpublished letters and documents from the files of prosecutor Hosea Morrill 
Knowlton. 
</P>
<P>
 The book doesn't contain any smoking guns -- or bloody hatchets either. Those 
who believe Lizzie Andrew Borden was accused unjustly can continue to do so. So 
can those who feel she got away with murder. 
</P>
<P>
 But the letters and papers, donated to the Fall River Historical Society by 
Knowlton's grandson in 1989, provide tantalizing firsthand material for 
historical researchers and Borden buffs about the case and public reaction. 
</P>
<P>
 Several people confessed to Knowlton. "Whiskey done the deed, not me," one 
anonymous letter-writer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Another confession, dated eight days after the murders, was from a man 
claiming to be the illegitimate son of victim Andrew Jackson Borden and a woman 
later committed to an insane asylum. 
</P>
<P>
 Writing from an Albany hotel, the man said Abby Durfee Borden convinced her 
husband to renege on an agreement to pay the son a yearly stipend for his 
silence. His letter, like many of them, was replete with odd spellings and 
style. 
</P>
<P>
 "So to make a long story short the son Brooded over his and his mothers past 
troubles and resolved upon Vengeance, with the result known to all," the man 
wrote, signing the letter Phillip Gordon Reed. 
</P>
<P>
 He says he disposed of the murder weapon, a "Lathers Hatchet," by dropping it 
from a steamboat at a dock in the seaside mill town. 
</P>
<P>
 "No use to track me for it will be an utter impossibility to do so. At the 
hour this letter is mailed I shall take a train for hundreds of miles away," he 
concluded. 
</P>
<P>
 If Knowlton investigated such a son, he left no written record, and the 
historical society was unable to find any documents showing he existed. 
</P>
<P>
 The book does lay to rest some misunderstandings about the case. 
</P>
<P>
 First things first: No 40 whacks, no forty-one. Abby Borden's body bore 18 
separate wounds, each described in the autopsy. Andrew Borden was struck 10 
times in the head. 
</P>
<P>
 An analysis of the contents of the victims' stomachs backs up testimony at the 
trial that Abby Borden was killed at least an hour earlier than Andrew Borden. 
</P>
<P>
 But perhaps most fascinating is the insight the book offers into widespread 
attention the case received from Americans of all political and social stripes. 
</P>
<P>
 The letters, mostly from residents along the Eastern seaboard, paint a picture 
of a different time, one without television, radio, telephones or automobiles, 
but one with plenty of public interest in crime drama. 
</P>
<P>
 People waited for days to read extensive excerpts from the trial in 
newspapers. Some published a full transcript of the statement that Lizzie, then 
32, gave at the preliminary inquiry. "The Fall River Mystery" merited 
front-page coverage in the New York Times. 
</P>
<P>
 But despite the lack of immediacy, people flooded Knowlton with criticism, 
advice, theories, even fan mail. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was amazing the number of people who were caught up in this case," said 
Michael Martins, curator of the Fall River Historical Society. "They ate it up. 
It was one of the first cases in the United States that was given this type of 
media attention." 
</P>
<P>
 Martins and Dennis A. Binette co-edited the book. Its 529 pages include an 
extraordinary appendix of biographical sketches of the letter writers, made 
possible by the detective work of Martins and Binette. 
</P>
<P>
 The letters came from attorneys, society matrons, learned thinkers, farmers, 
housewives and meat packers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am a woman away up in Vermont, but I am also an invalid and have much time 
for thought and reading," Elvira Daggett wrote. " . . . From the first I have 
been convinced of her guilt." 
</P>
<P>
 One "theorist" concluded that Lizzie Borden avoided splattering her clothes 
with blood by disrobing before she committed the murders. Another said Borden 
dressed like a man, an attempt to explain sightings of a stranger. 
</P>
<P>
 Psychics sent advice from the spirit world. One posed the whodunit to a Ouija 
board. 
</P>
<P>
 "Can it be possible that you are not going to put Emma Borden on the Stand? 
She KNOWS whether her sister committed that murder or not," wrote "a woman who 
wonders if there is such a thing as Justice." 
</P>
<P>
 Some said Lizzie Borden had no chance for justice because she was a woman, but 
others said she was getting preferential treatment because of her family's 
wealth and high social standing. Andrew Borden was worth $250,000, a 
considerable fortune in those days. Lizzie and her sister Emma inherited it 
all. 
</P>
<P>
 Writers of all opinions shared a disdain for the press coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 "From the start it was a losing fight -- You had everything to contend against 
-- Antecedent probability, popular clamor, the senseless drivel of the press, a 
WOMAN to be convicted," said Asa French, a former judge in private practice. 
</P>
<P>
 Lizzie Borden was acquitted June, 20, 1893, and lived, unmarried, until her 
death in 1927 in a splendid house she built on The Hill, a fashionable Fall 
River neighborhood. She was ostracized by local society.

ENVIRONMENTAL GADFLY A SOLID ALLY OF NATURE; FLORIDA: JACK RUDLOE HAS LITTLE 
PATIENCE WITH BUREAUCRACY OR WITH ACADEMIA. HE ENJOYS HIS REPUTATION AS A 
POLITICAL OUTSIDER AND ODDBALL OUTDOORSMAN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 "Aaah!" yells Jack Rudloe, snatching his thumb from a moray eel's slashing 
teeth. 
</P>
<P>
 A fish he's trying to feed to the eel flips over his shoulder and splashes 
into another aquarium. Rudloe grimaces and clutches his hand. 
</P>
<P>
 It's the fifth eel bite Rudloe has suffered since he closed the books on a 
short-lived college career three decades ago and moved to the beach to make a 
life working on shrimp boats with a collector's bucket. 
</P>
<P>
 Rudloe, 51, has since built a business gathering creatures like the moray that 
bit him. He also has made a reputation as a political gadfly, environmental 
entrepreneur and never-say-die naturalist. 
</P>
<P>
 He and his wife, marine biologist Anne Rudloe, recently published their fourth 
article for National Geographic magazine, a cover story on sea turtles. His 
fascination with turtles, he says, grew from a boyhood love of dime-store pet 
turtles. As an adult he has traveled the world in pursuit of wild ones. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jack is a fascinating guy," said Angus Cameron. "He collects specimens for 
research laboratories and university biology departments, but in the process he 
has become quite a technical expert himself." 
</P>
<P>
 Cameron is a retired editor for Alfred A. Knopf Inc., the New York book 
publishers. He worked with Rudloe on several books. Rudloe's work, said 
Cameron, "is probably the equivalent of a Ph.D. He's an extremely knowledgeable 
and serious scientist. He's been on a number of expeditions." 
</P>
<P>
 He also has written five books, as well as articles for Audubon, Geo, Natural 
History and other magazines and has counted among his mentors zoologists from 
Harvard University, Boston University, the American Museum of Natural History, 
the Scripps Institution of Oceanography and the Woods Hole Oceanographic 
Institution. He also has been the subject of television documentaries. 
</P>
<P>
 Though he makes his living from research and writing, Rudloe hated school and 
dropped out of college. 
</P>
<P>
 While still a student at Tallahassee's Leon High School, he published an 
article in the March, 1961, Scientific American magazine titled "Experiments 
With Sensitive Plants, Cassia Nictitans." It dealt with the leaf movements of 
the wild sensitive pea, which folds up when touched. 
</P>
<P>
 But his patience with academic life at Florida State University was measured 
in months. Classes interfered with work in his own greenhouse. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't particularly like the classroom approach," he said. "I was trying to 
do research and flunking. They said go away." 
</P>
<P>
 So he moved 35 miles south to the Gulf Coast, worked on shrimp trawlers, 
started his own laboratory, and became an unusual fixture in this fishing town 
of about 1,400 people in the Florida Panhandle. 
</P>
<P>
 Rudloe scorns the bureaucratic life as much as the academic. He calls 
government jobs "nothing but adult day care" and as an environmentalist he goes 
his own way. He rejects some of the Florida environmental movement's causes, 
such as a proposed ban on commercial fishing with nets. 
</P>
<P>
 At Rudloe's Gulf Specimen Marine Laboratories, concrete saltwater tanks crawl, 
churn and splash with creatures he collects to sell to medical schools, 
universities, aquariums and other scientific or educational institutions. 
</P>
<P>
 The eel that bit Rudloe slithers back beneath the rocks. An assistant brings a 
mug of warm water. Rudloe, still grimacing, plunges his thumb into the mug. 
</P>
<P>
 The bite is all in a day's work. Rudloe has gone on adventures such as the 
Woods Hole International Indian Ocean Expedition in Madagascar. He has tagged 
sea turtles throughout the world for migration studies and once grappled with 
an alligator. 
</P>
<P>
 Between trips, he fights other battles at home. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Coastal Restaurant, a Panacea lunch counter, the waitress calls him 
Jack and doesn't have to ask his coffee order. Other diners perk up as he talks 
about planning a protest at a formerly public local beach that now charges 50 
cents admission. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll go get arrested with you," said Buck Winton of Crawfordville, waving 
from another table. 
</P>
<P>
 The talk moves to a fight against the closing of Otter Lake Park, a favorite 
Panacea hangout at nearby St. Mark's Wildlife Refuge. Developer Ronald Fred 
Crum walks over and sits next to Rudloe. 
</P>
<P>
 Crum has built a marina and other projects opposed by Rudloe. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jack's cost me a lot of money," Crum said. "But he's right on this issue. The 
private citizen has to work under the law. The government has no law. 
Government is sick." 
</P>
<P>
 Later in the day, Rudloe stops by Otter Lake. Two 10-foot alligators drift in 
the sun 100 feet out in the lake, gazing at the visitors walking down to the 
cypress-lined shore. 
</P>
<P>
 A decade earlier, Rudloe had by reflex leaped on a similar-sized alligator at 
Otter Lake when it pounced on his Airedale, Linda, as he and the dog splashed 
in the lake after jogging. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got it in a headlock," he recalls. "Then I realized the tactile reality of 
what I had done. I stuck my thumbs in its eyes and punched it around." 
</P>
<P>
 Both man and beast escaped uninjured. Rudloe wrote about the encounter for 
Reader's Digest and Audubon magazine.

 Rudloe knows that his opposition to environmental groups that want to ban 
commercial net fishing is open to conflict-of-interest criticism because the 
nets often bring in specimens he can use. But he insists that's not his only 
motivation. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they ban the nets, these people have nothing around here," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 While government regulations restrict net fishing, he adds: "We're allowing 
just endless recreational boats. There are 700,000 boats roaring around out 
there, and they are the sacred cows." 
</P>
<P>
 Rudloe lives in a frame house, shaded by tall trees, on pilings above storm 
water level. A wood dock reaches into the glittering Gulf.

CONNECTICUT TEEN SETS UP TOLL-FREE SUICIDE HOT LINE; SURVIVAL: GIRL, 13, TRIED 
TO KILL HERSELF TWICE A YEAR AGO. SHE HAD NO ONE TO TALK TO ABOUT HER PROBLEMS, 
SHE SAYS; NOW SHE WANTS TO OFFER PEERS AN UNDERSTANDING EAR.

 A year ago, Brianna Baylis began having boyfriend trouble. She felt betrayed 
and decided the quickest way to end the pain would be to end her life. 
</P>
<P>
 She was only 12 years old. 
</P>
<P>
 Twice she tried to kill herself -- the first time by drinking a bottle of a 
non-prescription medicine, the second by heading out to Interstate 84 to throw 
herself in front of a car. Another girl screamed and stopped her from walking 
into traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 Brianna said she had no one to talk to at the time. Her best friend, who also 
had attempted suicide, had been sent away to a special school. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's so important to have somebody to talk with, somebody your own age who 
understands what you're feeling," the 13-year-old said. 
</P>
<P>
 Brianna spent two weeks in the hospital and four months in counseling. As part 
of a class project last spring at Bethel Middle School, where she is in the 
intellectually gifted program, Brianna decided to try to reach out and help 
other troubled children. 
</P>
<P>
 Her determination paid off: The seventh grader was awarded a $600 grant to set 
up a toll-free suicide hot line to be operated for and by kids. She hopes to 
have it running this fall. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kids will talk to other kids when they won't talk to adults, especially if 
it's something really personal, like a problem with a boyfriend," she said in 
an interview. 
</P>
<P>
 The grant came from the Falk Foundation for Excellence in Middlebury, a 
private foundation that encourages young people to pursue creative ideas. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, teen-age 
suicide has increased fivefold over the past 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990, the most recent year for which figures are available, the national 
suicide rate for teens was 11.1 per 100,000. In Connecticut, 16 teens took 
their lives that year, and state health officials believe the number is on the 
rise. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard enough being a teen-ager even if you do have a person you can talk 
to, and it's even harder if you don't," Brianna wrote in her grant application. 
</P>
<P>
 Her peer counseling service will be staffed by youngsters in the 8th through 
10th grades from Bethel and neighboring towns. She has already begun contacting 
principals to find volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
 Marc Gershowitz, a Danbury psychologist, has agreed to train the young 
volunteers. Each will get a special telephone and a list of emergency numbers. 
</P>
<P>
 Gershowitz said he will teach listening techniques so the volunteers can help 
calm upset callers. 
</P>
<P>
 "What it's doing is, it's reaching a group of adolescents that have gotten so 
angry and frustrated in their dealings with the world . . . that they've pretty 
much given up that feeling of trust that people with legitimate authority could 
be of any use to them," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Brianna's mother, Jan Baylis, said she is proud that her daughter not only has 
had the courage to deal with her own problems but wants to help others. 
</P>
<P>
 "Life can be very painful for a sensitive teen-ager," she said. "When I was 
growing up, suicide wasn't considered a viable alternative as a way to stop the 
pain, but things are different now." 
</P>
<P>
 Sherry Earle, who teaches the gifted students at Bethel Middle School, said 
she, too, is proud that the Falk Foundation chose to fund Brianna's project. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oftentimes kids this age can't define a plan. The judges felt that she would 
carry it out," she said.

ANALYST TRIES TO PREDICT FIRE'S BEHAVIOR; WEST: BOB WALKER SEES BLAZES AS 
LIVING THINGS. CURRENTLY, HE'S ASSIGNED TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THE FIRES RAVAGING 
THE PACIFIC NORTHWEST WILL DO NEXT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 It crawls. It walks. It lies down at night, then awakens by day to run through 
the woods. When Bob Walker describes the biggest wildfire in the West, there's 
a reason it sounds like a living thing. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a living thing," said Walker, a fire behavior analyst who takes the 
pulse of the beast each day, seeking clues to a question on the mind of 
everyone here: Where will the fire go next? 
</P>
<P>
 The answer is critical. Across the West, heat and drought have produced some 
of the most volatile fire behavior ever observed -- from a wind-whipped blaze 
in Colorado that killed 14 firefighters to a cluster of fast-spreading fires in 
Washington that have charred more than 190,000 acres in two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 What determines whether a wildfire will creep along the forest floor or 
explode into the treetops? Why does it spare one canyon, only to fill the next 
with a firestorm of 200-foot flames? 
</P>
<P>
 It is Walker's job to know. As one of the 50 fire behavior analysts assigned 
to the West's wildfires, he rises each day before dawn and falls back into his 
tent around midnight, tracking the weather and the fire to make the dangerous 
work of firefighting a little safer. 
</P>
<P>
 He uses sophisticated computer models and detailed weather forecasts. But last 
week, as Walker drove up the smoke-filled Entiat River valley on a scouting 
mission, no high-tech gadgetry was needed to see the severity of the Tyee fire, 
which has burned more than 116,000 acres across the eastern slopes of the 
Cascade Range. It is the biggest of dozens of fires burning in the West. 
</P>
<P>
 Along one half-mile stretch, 200-foot flames had roared down from the ridge, 
turning trees into charred poles, leveling houses. 
</P>
<P>
 One witness saw a whole tree sucked up into the clouds, twirling in a tornado 
of flame. Others saw a flame tornado turned on its side by the wind, performing 
barrel rolls across the treetops. Walker calls that a horizontal-roll vortex. 
Those who saw it called it terrifying. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was pandemonium here," Walker said. "This is some incredible fire behavior 
we're seeing." 
</P>
<P>
 Farther up the road, on a ridge the fire had not yet reached, Walker stared at 
a line of flame creeping across the canyon wall. The wind was relatively calm, 
the temperature was 92, and smoke billowed high in a brown column. 
</P>
<P>
 This kind of fire, known as a plume-dominated fire, worries wildfire experts 
even more than high winds. Wind, at least, fans flames in a predictable 
direction. A plume-dominated fire follows the fuel, pulsing out anywhere it 
finds dry vegetation, creating its own erratic winds. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts have just begun to understand the phenomenon, learning since 1989 that 
plume development often can be predicted by low humidity, high temperature and 
atmospheric instability, which can have an effect similar to opening the flue 
of a chimney. 
</P>
<P>
 "When that column starts defining itself, then you start walking in the other 
direction -- real fast," Walker said. 
</P>
<P>
 Walker, 45, has been a fire behavior analyst since 1987. In the winter, he 
works for the Deschutes National Forest in Oregon, assessing the efficiency of 
fire preparedness. During a parched summer like this, he goes wherever the 
fires are burning hottest.

KAMCHATKA FASHIONS A VISION OF A VOLCANIC TOURIST WONDERLAND; RUSSIA: REGION 
HOPES TO ATTRACT FINANCING FOR MINERAL AND FISHING INDUSTRIES BY PROMOTING THE 
WILDLIFE, SALMON STREAMS, INDIGENOUS PEOPLES AND 28 ACTIVE VOLCANOES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Kamchatka Province lies so far east of Moscow -- 4,700 miles and nine time 
zones -- that it's very nearly west of the Russian capital. 
</P>
<P>
 Lenin thought so: He once offered to lease this California-size peninsula to 
an American businessman. Today, Kamchatka's elected leaders think so too, 
working hard to attract Western capital for mineral and fishing industries. 
They offer visions of a volcanic tourist wonderland teeming with wildlife, 
laced with magnificent salmon streams and populated by indigenous peoples 
called Itelmen, Even, Koryak and Chukchi. 
</P>
<P>
 The visions are true. The peninsula's 500-mile section of the Pacific Ring of 
Fire contains 28 active volcanoes. The scenic superstar is 15,584-foot 
Klyuchevskaya, Russia's highest, which emits about 60 million tons of magma a 
year. Farther south lies the great caldera of Ksudach, whose eruption in 1907 
was one of the 10 largest of the 20th Century. 
</P>
<P>
 This hellish landscape boasts a touch of heaven, too, in hot springs like the 
Khodutkinskaya River, which emerges from the foot of Khodutka Volcano at 161 
degrees to be cooled to hot-tub temperatures by icy surface streams. Floating 
silently here, wreathed in sulfur-tinged steam and watching the evening sky 
slowly fill with stars, can seem like a rerun of creation. 
</P>
<P>
 Kamchatka is largely roadless. For travelers, a chartered helicopter is the 
only way to go. "I know every rock and birch tree personally," said Capt. 
Vladimir Samarski, skimming his helicopter along narrow valleys and around 
precipitous peaks. Here and there he lands to collect firewood and buy fresh 
reindeer meat and homemade salmon caviar from friends who live in isolated 
regions. "Everyone welcomes us -- it is almost like a festival sometimes," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 One of his far-flung friends is a full-blooded Even named Alla Kechgichavina, 
a small, seraphic woman camped near the Icha River. She wears hip boots and a 
canvas parka and carries the rifle with which she has earned a living for 30 
years as a hunter of ermine and fox. 
</P>
<P>
 A tough life has left her with an inner serenity. "I'm very rich; I have 
everything here -- animals, birds, the taiga," she said. "It's just a pity I'm 
so old." 
</P>
<P>
 In the village of Kovran, historian Oleg Zaporotsky is less sanguine. He is 
the founder of Sunrise, the Council for Rebirth of Kamchatka Itelmens. 
</P>
<P>
 "Itelmens possess the oldest culture in Kamchatka," he said. "We are descended 
from the first wave of eastward Asian migration, which began about 14,000 years 
ago. There were 25,000 Itelmens when the Russians came in 1697. We began dying 
from disease, or war with Cossacks. Today we are only 2,000." 
</P>
<P>
 To the north, where the Pyatibratskaya River flows into the Sea of Okhotsk, 
Gavriel Kikhlyab, 52, a Koryak, is pioneering an old way of life with his wife, 
Galina, and their two children. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is my place. I was born here," he said, surveying a campsite where 
salmon dry on a driftwood framework. The couple moved here five years ago. "I 
have spent most of my life herding reindeer for the state farm," Kikhlyab said. 
"Now we catch salmon and dry them to sell to the herders." 
</P>
<P>
 In olden times, when shore-dwellers hunted whales in the Okhotsk Sea, they 
were careful to honor their prey. On Dobrzhanskiy Island they erected a shrine 
made of whale bones, visible from the surrounding sea. Today, a scattering of 
bones of lesser prey -- reindeer, seals, even dogs -- indicates that the 
spiritual tradition isn't dead. 
</P>
<P>
 Old gods also survive in the Chukchi village of Achavayam, where Ludmila Koyan 
is custodian of her family's idols -- wooden male and female figures festooned 
with bells, spoons, twigs, leather ornaments and other memorabilia. "These have 
been our gods as long as we are on the Earth," she said. "They know all about 
the people. They must be fed each spring with bone butter made of reindeer 
marrow and blood, or they will cause trouble." 
</P>
<P>
 Of all Kamchatka's native groups, the Aleuts of Bering Island are closest to 
losing their heritage. Russians brought them here from Alaska's Pribilof 
Islands in 1826 to hunt fur seals. Today, only 200 of their descendants 
survive. 
</P>
<P>
 "Natives were considered the lowest level here," said Valentina Stus, chairman 
of the Aleutski Regional Soviet. "The government said children had to be taken 
from Aleut families because we were too poor. But actually they wanted to 
eliminate our language and traditions." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Aleut language has been lost, traditional hunting continues. Once 
a year, during fur seal mating season, hunters make the 12-hour voyage to 
Mednyy Island, whose cliffs jut from the sea about halfway between Kamchatka 
and Attu Island. Using clubs, the hunters kill the seals swiftly and 
methodically. 
</P>
<P>
 Bering Island east of Kamchatka is named for Danish explorer Vitus Bering, who 
died here in 1741 when his ship was driven ashore while returning from his 
discovery of southern Alaska. Recently archeologists discovered his grave and 
those of six crewmen at Commander Bay, took their bones to Moscow for study and 
rectified a 250-year-old case of mistaken identity. 
</P>
<P>
 For reasons unknown, a portrait of a portly relative of Bering's has been used 
for two centuries as a model for statues and paintings of the great explorer. 
"We learned that he is not his uncle," said Prof. Victor N. Zviagin of Moscow's 
Institute of Forensic Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
 Zviagin carefully reconstructed Bering's features on a cast of his skull, 
revealing a handsome man of about 58, slightly quizzical, slightly sad. 
</P>
<P>
 Bering's discovery of Alaska turned Petropavlovsk into a boom town, providing 
logistic support for Russia's trade empire, which stretched from the Aleutian 
Islands to California and Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cold War turned all of Kamchatka into a fortress where Soviet nuclear 
submarines, bombers and fighters stood guard against American forces. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Russian warships remain in port for lack of funds and fuel, while a new 
Russian Orthodox church rises on a hill above the harbor, its three domes 
golden beacons for tourist ships.

EPA TARGETS PESTICIDE AT DINNER TABLE; FOOD: AGENCY SAYS IT'S TIME TO WORRY 
ABOUT MORE THAN THE RESIDUE ON CROPS LEAVING THE FARM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT GREENE, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In expansive new proposals, the Environmental Protection Agency wants to 
regulate the amount of pesticide residues on the food we eat -- everything from 
supermarket apples to ketchup. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency says it's time to worry about the amounts of chemicals that show up 
in meals, not just the residues on crops leaving the farm. The idea in proposed 
legislation and in new rules under discussion would be to set limits on how 
much residue is acceptable on food. 
</P>
<P>
 That sounds like a common-sense notion, but it's not the way things are. The 
first pesticide regulations sought to ensure that farmers weren't misusing 
chemicals, said Dr. Lynn Goldman, the EPA's top official in charge of pesticide 
regulation. 
</P>
<P>
 Concerns about the safety of food followed. The starting point under the new 
plan is food safety, moving backward in the food chain to the farm. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a great idea," said Richard Wiles, who is in charge of pesticide issues 
at the Environmental Working Group, an organization that closely watches the 
impact of agriculture on the environment. 
</P>
<P>
 Between harvest and the dinner table, pesticides wear off, are washed off, get 
peeled or are diluted during processing and mixing. The government now sets 
different tolerances for pesticide residues in processed foods such as corn oil 
only if the residue is concentrated in the end product. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency also may propose to set tolerances -- acceptable residues of 
chemicals that may cause cancer or other ailments -- based more on how foods 
are likely to be consumed. 
</P>
<P>
 Tolerances on corn now consider the whole plant with the husk on. Iceberg 
lettuce tolerances don't consider that the lettuce is washed and most people 
throw away the outer leaves. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent testimony before a House agriculture subcommittee, Goldman tried to 
portray the idea of setting different tolerances at the farm gate, the food 
processor and the retail store as farmer friendly. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we took that dinner-plate standard and applied it at the farm gate, then 
we might not be able to allow a perfectly reasonable use of the pesticides to 
meet the needs of the farmers," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Industry doesn't like the pesticide legislation offered by the Administration 
because a more conservative way of measuring risk will lead to tighter 
restrictions all around. Regulators could no longer consider the benefit of 
higher, more efficient production of crops when setting tolerances in raw 
goods, for instance. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill would take into account the special vulnerability of children because 
of their immature bodies and tendency to consume more fruits and vegetables by 
body weight. Other exposures, such as bug sprays in houses, would be considered 
as well. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea of different acceptable residues along the food chain means the Food 
and Drug Administration will be concentrating more of its inspectors at 
canneries and supermarkets. 
</P>
<P>
 The change would create an enforcement nightmare that the government lacks the 
money and people to enforce, industry contends. And there's the prospect of 
fees to pay for it all. 
</P>
<P>
 The government, for instance, may be setting safe levels for pesticides in a 
range of products, such as fresh tomatoes, tomato paste, ketchup, spaghetti 
sauce and stewed tomatoes, said Juanita Duggan, chief lobbyist for the National 
Food Processors Assn.

A FATHER'S WISH: TO SEE HIS DAUGHTER BEFORE HE DIES; KOREA: SEOUL RESIDENT HAS 
NOT SEEN CHILD SINCE WAR BROKE OUT IN 1950, SEPARATING THE FAMILY. PLIGHT IS 
SHARED BY ABOUT 10 MILLION PEOPLE ON THE PENINSULA.

<P>
 At the age of 70, Kim Kab-bae is haunted by the memory of a daughter he has 
not seen for almost half a century. 
</P>
<P>
 As he approaches the end of his life, Kim's final wish is to see his daughter 
one last time. He doesn't know if she is dead or alive. 
</P>
<P>
 Kim is one of about 10 million Koreans separated from their families by the 
1945 division of the peninsula and the subsequent 1950-53 Korean War. Since 
then, nearly all cross-border links or contacts between residents of the two 
countries have been cut. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had a dream once of my daughter in North Korea. She was holding a letter in 
her hand, running to me and crying for her mother," Kim said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The dream always haunts me. I don't think my daughter has ever forgiven me 
for leaving her alone in North Korea," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kim's hopes for a reunion rose when the leaders of South and North Korea 
scheduled their first meeting for July 25-27. 
</P>
<P>
 South Korean President Kim Young-sam said the issue of separated families 
would be addressed at the summit. 
</P>
<P>
 "But when I heard that North Korean leader Kim Il-sung had died, my hopes of 
seeing my daughter died with him," said a tearful Kim, his voice breaking with 
emotion. 
</P>
<P>
 Kim Il-sung died July 8. 
</P>
<P>
 Kim's story is typical of the wrenching split still affecting about 15% of 
Korea's population. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the Korean War erupted in June, 1950, Kim was working at a North Korean 
government office in Kaesong, close to the border with the South. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the war broke out, it was chaotic," Kim said. "It was difficult for me 
because I was a government officer. People were not willing to hide or help 
me." 
</P>
<P>
 Kim said he tried several times to head back north to his wife and two 
children. "But bridges were blown up and there was no way for me to go," he 
said, wiping away tears. 
</P>
<P>
 Kim's late wife, Choi Hak-soo, also had traumatic experiences before escaping 
to the South, an account she related in a book written by the couple. 
</P>
<P>
 Choi said that at first she lacked the courage to take her daughter and son 
through the war-ravaged countryside to the South. 
</P>
<P>
 But with help from Kim's family, Choi found someone to guide her south for 
120,000 won (about $150), considered a fortune at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 "I paid the person half and promised the other half upon our crossing," Choi 
said in the book. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew then I had to escape," Choi wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 She vividly recalled in the book the day she had to choose which child to 
take. "I couldn't carry them both. I told my 6-year-old daughter to be good and 
that I would return for her after taking her younger brother to his father." 
</P>
<P>
 "Who would have thought that would be the last time I would see my daughter? 
Even now, 40 years later, my heart breaks whenever I think of what my daughter 
must have gone through." 
</P>
<P>
 Mother and son escaped to Kanghwa, in South Korean territory south of Kaesong. 
They soon met Kim, who traveled to Kanghwa daily in the hope of finding his 
family among the cross-border stream of refugees. 
</P>
<P>
 "As soon as we met, my wife said she wanted to return to the north for our 
daughter. But by then the war was over and there was no way back," Kim said. 
</P>
<P>
 An armistice signed on July 27, 1953, ended the fighting, but no peace treaty 
was signed. To this day, the two Koreas remain technically at war. 
</P>
<P>
 Kim said he had hoped to meet his daughter in 1985 when both governments 
allowed scores of families to hold brief reunions for the first and only time. 
</P>
<P>
 "My wife died without ever hearing from our daughter again. I don't want the 
same to happen to me. I want to see her, or even know if she's dead or alive," 
Kim said, bowing his head.

ARTICLE ON CAR-BUYING TRAPS WAS FULL OF ERRORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I have been a new car dealer in Southern California for 25 years, and 
therefore I quite naturally read "The 10 Costliest Car-Buying Traps" (July 24). 
Unfortunately, rather than be of assistance to the readers, I discovered that 
there are so many errors or misleading statements that the article was actually 
counterproductive for those it was intended to serve. 
</P>
<P>
 First, let me address the general insinuation that dealers prefer doing 
business with customers who are totally ignorant of the kind of vehicle they 
want or who are ignorant of the profit margin built into the sale of a vehicle. 
To the contrary, most dealers will tell you that it is far easier to do 
business with customers who have a rather clear idea of what make, model and 
accessories they want and who have some understanding of the dealer's profit 
margin. Most well-informed customers understand that a dealership must make 
enough profit to meet its payroll and bills; they just don't want to be taken 
advantage of. 
</P>
<P>
 A related insinuation is that little or nothing useful ever happens to a 
customer at a dealership -- that a customer is better off spending their time 
digesting the information available in the public library or found through 
on-line computer services. While it is true that some useful comparisons can be 
made by reading consumer and auto magazines, the fact is that nothing can 
substitute for the actual experience of looking at and test-driving vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
 The article warns buyers about "getting pushed into a lease" when they enter a 
dealership with the intent of buying a vehicle. The fact is, of course, that 
hundreds of thousands of buyers every year do precisely what the article 
"warns" against because, when they sit down at the dealership and think through 
all the pluses and minuses of leasing, they realize this is the most rational 
thing to do. Through leasing, the customer can drive a better vehicle, stop 
worrying about the vehicle's unpredictable value at time of trade, keep their 
cash working for them rather than give it to a lender, and still come out ahead 
even if they should have to pay for excess mileage at the end of the lease. 
</P>
<P>
 The article also worries that customers at the dealership might "load up on 
options" such as upgraded sound systems, special seats, alloy wheels and tinted 
glass, since these don't "pay off" in terms of safety, resale value or 
insurance costs. The article has trouble with the notion that people might take 
intrinsic pride in the way their vehicle looks or might buy a vehicle for 
aesthetic as well as practical reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 The article also is concerned that extended service contracts -- or what 
others call the extended warranty -- can become invalid if the owner fails to 
perform regular maintenance on a vehicle and because there are, the article 
suggests, few ways to enforce the contract if the company that provides it goes 
out of business. The reality is that both new car factory warranties as well as 
extended service contracts can be invalidated if an owner fails to perform 
scheduled maintenance as prescribed for the vehicle. It is hard to imagine how 
or why it should be otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
 The article also mentions possible tampering with odometers on used cars, even 
though this practice has been virtually eliminated by tamper-proof odometers, 
stiff state and federal laws, and federal and state inspectors.

CHANGE OF FAITH CAN'T WASH AWAY MISCONDUCT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "In the Shadow of the '80s" (July 31) can easily lead to a harmful 
misconception of the teachings of the Jewish faith. Such phrases as " . . . he 
has renounced crime and found Jesus" and "he's banking on his dramatic 
conversion from Judaism to make a comeback" suggest that somehow crime and 
Judaism go together and that only by renouncing his faith through a "dramatic" 
conversion could he start a crime-free life. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Judaism nor its daughter religion, Christianity, teaches or 
countenances wickedness. Both accept with loving, open arms true, sincere 
penitents who attempt to right the wrongs they have committed and sin no more. 
</P>
<P>
 It was not his Judaism which led Barry Minkow to his downfall, it was lack of 
understanding of the teachings of Judaism, which, apparently, he never 
thoroughly absorbed. 
</P>
<P>
 What is distressing is that the article can lead one to believe that a change 
of faith can wash away misconduct. If so, it would be easy for all Christians 
who might be guilty of a breach of the law to convert to some other faith. It 
is unfortunate that a story on the excesses of the '80s introduced the very 
personal and private matter of religious persuasion.

<P>
 That Barry Minkow is a "scoundrel caught red-handed" is true. But to say he 
has "renounced crime and found Jesus . . . and he's banking on his dramatic 
conversion from Judaism to make a comeback," implies that somehow crime and 
Judaism are connected. 
</P>
<P>
 This is a very inflammatory approach to the misdeeds of Minkow and others of 
that era. And to imply that Judaism and-or any other religion teaches this type 
of criminal and immoral behavior is like throwing gas on a fire: It does a 
disservice to us all and smacks of bigotry. 
</P>
<P>
 The scoundrels were many. People were driven by greed and the desire for 
limitless power. As the result of the deregulation of financial institutions, 
these people were given a license to steal, and steal they did. 
</P>
<P>
 The order of business here was "scoundrels of the '80s," not religious 
conversion.

DISABILITIES ACT FAILED TO FULFILL ITS MANDATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Far from fulfilling one of its central promises of bringing disabled adults 
into the mainstream of American life by removing barriers to getting jobs, the 
Americans With Disabilities Act has to date only served to heighten the 
awareness of workers rights ("A Job Still to Be Done," July 26). 
</P>
<P>
 While the disabled is a group the federal government defines to include nearly 
49 million people, two-thirds of working-age Americans with disabilities remain 
jobless, according to surveys taken recently.Yet, while the ADA's benefits to 
society far outweigh any burden on employers, deep-seated discrimination 
against the disabled implies that it may take a long time for the ADA to make 
any headway regardless of the $100 billion a year for welfare to people who 
should be working. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the current expansion for the ADA now covers 85% of the work force 
against the previous 77% of U.S. workers, the ADA can do much more than benefit 
a small group of people nationwide.

AMERICANS BURDENED BY ANTI-SAVING POLICIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 James Flanigan's "Behind Spendthrift Statistics, U.S. Has Saving Graces" (July 
24) touches a critical matter impacting the American economy; it has been a 
problem since the 1960s when the world market and the decline in our savings 
rate threw us out of the catbird seat. Your choice of words makes an unstated 
statement: that Americans do not save because they do not choose to save. 
</P>
<P>
 I argue with that position. 
</P>
<P>
 Americans do not save because they are burdened (for several reason) with 
policies which make it damned difficult to save. The most important of these 
policies are those which make Americans automobile-dependent. The cost of 
automobiles, parking, municipal services, freeways and other roadways absorbs 
25% of our gross product. 
</P>
<P>
 How can even the most dedicated saver save money when he is saddled with car 
payments, the cost of a home inflated with the costs of highways, parking, 
police and fire protection for motorists, the costs of parking added to the 
price of groceries, hardware, medical care, et. al -- when, because of 
automobile-dependency, new homes are invariably built in places like Lancaster 
and Moreno Valley a zillion miles from anywhere, particularly jobs?

QUALITY MANAGEMENT REQUIRES MONITORING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I was a little amazed by Michael Schrage's techno-trash polemic ("Corporate 
'1984' May Intrude About 10 Years Late," July 28). Are we to believe that it is 
not OK for an employer to measure and attempt to improve upon the productivity 
of a data-entry operator? And just what is particularly sinister about 
monitoring the telephone effectiveness of customer service employees and 
thereby ensuring that customers are properly treated? 
</P>
<P>
 The spread of proactive quality management will depend largely on data 
collection and data analysis as learning tools. That is exactly the point 
behind the intense electronic scrutiny over military operations and the use of 
flight recorders on commercial aircraft. (It's tough to debrief dead pilots.) 
And what is wrong with collecting and retaining data about our work? Does Marc 
Rotenberg have a problem with being held accountable? 
</P>
<P>
 Rotenberg's "Three years out . . . " scenario is Chaplinesque. Imagine 
"management" poring over day-to-day e-mail traffic in search of politically 
incorrect morsels with which to persecute indiscreet knowledge workers. 
"Surveillance is creeping up the 'org' chart." How embarrassing.

CANINE RESENTS BEING USED AS A METAPHOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Allan Sloan's "Corporate Carnivore Bites the Hand That Defends Him" (July 24) 
put my dog in a real snit. He resents being used as a metaphor for Victor 
Posner.He's sensitive that way, just like Falla -- remember Falla? He was 
sensitive too. 
</P>
<P>
 Ralph, my dog, is upset by other financial news in your newspaper. He knows 
darned well when Alan Greenspan raises interest rates, he'll get the cheap dog 
biscuits, because the bond market's been trashed. Apparently his dog friends 
are no better off. They must have told him that they get bargain-brand dog food 
because of our poor trade policy, the job-poor recovery, the downsizing. 
</P>
<P>
 When I read Ralph the latest financial news, he raises his eyebrows; he hates 
that global market with its effect on our work force. No more vacations, fewer 
outings, silent walks with his people friend. 
</P>
<P>
 He thinks Alan Greenspan should get a dog with a good nose for inflation so he 
doesn't overdo it again. What's good for Wall Street is not necessarily good 
for dogs or their friends.

 Gene Pomerantz is on target with his "Buy American" letter ("U.S. Citizens

THE SUNDAY PROFILE; BATTING 1.000; EVEN WITH MILLIONS OF DOLLARS AT STAKE, 
SPORTS AGENT JEFF MOORAD HAS NO USE FOR WRITTEN CONTRACTS. ALL IT TAKES FOR HIM 
TO SIGN SOME OF BASEBALL'S TOP TALENT IS A LOW-KEY APPROACH AND A HANDSHAKE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Another baseball strike looms, and you're ticked, right? The average player 
salary is $1.2 million, and that's not enough? Gimme a break, you say? 
</P>
<P>
 OK, calm down. Let Jeff Moorad explain it to you. Moorad has been explaining 
the players' side for 12 years, using his friendly, reassuring baritone to 
negotiate contracts that have made jillionaires out of jocks. Have a seat on 
the sofa in his Newport Beach office. He'll be with you as soon as he's off the 
phone. 
</P>
<P>
 Then he'll amuse you with an anecdote. He'll small talk about the people who 
have called that day, dropping familiar names like acorns. He'll confide in you 
about this deal that's about to close. He'll flatter you by telling his 
assistant to take a message when the league office calls. He'll chuckle at 
something you say and join in the kidding. 
</P>
<P>
 And then, rather suddenly, he will slide into business. The Caring Voice of 
Reason (which has become the Moorad service mark around the leagues) will help 
it all make sense. 
</P>
<P>
 It's ironic, he says, that society has an easy time accepting that a sports 
franchise owner gets millions "yet a very difficult time understanding why an 
athlete, who after all is the chief entertainment component of that owner's 
profit-making, (is) making millions of dollars himself." 
</P>
<P>
 No one complains about what Clint Eastwood makes, because he's an entertainer. 
"I think it's important to remember that big-time sports today have become pure 
entertainment. The games survive as competitions, but the business surrounding 
those games are billion-dollar industries." 
</P>
<P>
 Players received about half of baseball's $1.8-billion gross revenues last 
season, he says. "Who (better) to receive those dollars than the people who are 
bringing the fans through the turnstiles, to the TV to watch the broadcast -- 
the players themselves?" 
</P>
<P>
 He'll show you the 1914 portrait of his grandfather, Frank Shaw, in a Modesto 
Reds uniform, bat in hand, pretending to await a pitch. "He was a professional 
baseball player, and he was invited up to the big leagues once. But he didn't 
go -- because he had to support his family." 
</P>
<P>
 Moorad chuckles at the irony. So do you. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten minutes of this and you may not be converted, but you don't feel like 
fighting anymore. Certainly not with a nice, friendly guy like Jeff. You are 
confident that if you call back in a year, in five years, he will remember you 
and invite you over to the house on Balboa Island. 
</P>
<P>
 And that, say the people whom he works for and against, is the difference and 
the secret of Jeffrey S. Moorad, 39, the quiet although not silent partner of 
Steinberg & Moorad, home of some of the biggest bucks in the sports-agent 
business. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is as good at the schmooze as anyone, although that's a belittling term 
that doesn't really apply here," says Larry Baer, executive vice president of 
the San Francisco Giants. 
</P>
<P>
 "He uses sugar instead of vinegar," says another team's general manager, who 
asked not to be identified. Make that molasses, he says, since it moves so 
slowly. 
</P>
<P>
 "I mean this literally: All a negotiation needs to take is 10 minutes. But 
this year, most of Jeff's guys were the last to sign. In my opinion, he wanted 
his deals to look better than the other deals, so he strung them out." 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Quinn, general manager of the Giants, agrees. "Jeff does not like to 
strike a quick deal because it would give the appearance to the (player's) 
family that they could have done it themselves. It's all posturing -- needless 
posturing, I might add." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, concedes Tom Grieve, general manager of the Texas Rangers, "He's a very 
good negotiator. He gets solid deals for his clients. His goal is the same as 
any other agent, but he's pleasant to deal with. His style is very low-key." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Moorad joined the firm in 1985 and became a partner four years later. But 
while his partner, Leigh Steinberg, has repeatedly been profiled in print and 
on TV, Moorad seldom appears except to explain the terms of a just-sealed deal. 
While Steinberg basks in the description "super agent," a term he helped 
inspire, Moorad prefers the title "sports attorney." 
</P>
<P>
 And while Steinberg is known for guiding NFL quarterbacks, it was Moorad's 
success in baseball that made him the jigsaw fit in the partnership. He now 
handles football and broadcast negotiations as well, but at Steinberg & Moorad, 
he is still Mr. Baseball. When the Dodgers play the Giants, eight of the 
players and broadcasters are Moorad's. 
</P>
<P>
 Among his clients: the Giants' Matt Williams ($30.75 million over five years), 
the Rangers' Will Clark ($30 million over five years) and the Dodgers' Eric 
Karros ($6.15 million over three years) and Cory Snyder ($3 million over two 
years). Also Greg Olson (Atlanta Braves), Ray Lankford (St. Louis Cardinals), 
Mike Macfarlane (Kansas City Royals) and Kirt Manwaring (Giants). Moorad has 
also enlisted a flock of minor-league hatchlings for whose potential big-league 
teams have paid high-end six- and even seven-figure sums. (A baseball agent 
typically receives 4% to 5% of a player's major-league salary.) 
</P>
<P>
 The relationship is all-consuming for Moorad, longtime clients say. One 
associate said he doubts that Moorad has any close friends outside baseball. 
When his first child, a son, was born last month, his first call after family 
went to Clark. Moorad's wedding photograph shows 10 ushers standing behind him 
-- a partner, five clients and four relatives. 
</P>
<P>
 "He doesn't venture out of that circle too much," says Clark, a first baseman 
who has been a Moorad client for nine years. "And when he does, it's out of 
necessity, out of stress and burnout. When he's working, that's where his focus 
is." 
</P>
<P>
 And Moorad is working virtually all the time. Modern communications allow him 
a telephone always at his side, and he is on it from daybreak (there are two 
lines into the bathroom) to late into the night, negotiating, arranging, 
counseling, gossiping, just saying hi. Even his partner is amazed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jeff has probably the most phone volume I've ever seen in a lawyer," 
Steinberg says. "One of Jeff's new hobbies is calling from planes, which is 
probably $1.75 a minute. He can do a tremendous amount of damage from L.A. to 
New York." The firm's monthly phone bill averages $7,500. 
</P>
<P>
 The result is a tie that binds more tightly than a contract, Moorad says. As 
hokey as it sounds, he says, clients become family -- literally. He married the 
sister-in-law of a client -- Olson, a relief pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
 Moorad says, and his clients confirm, that their agreement is based on a 
handshake, not a written contract. 
</P>
<P>
 "Over the years, we've become friends, almost like he's not my agent anymore," 
says Snyder, who has been a client for 10 years. "We've both been at each 
other's weddings. It's a very close relationship. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "It's pretty much up to me when to write him his check. He has clients to 
where they know when to do it. He never has to tell you. He knows his clients 
are responsible enough." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 That approach is probably unusual, the Giants' Quinn says, "but I think that's 
a great way to do business. If you're entrusting that kind of money to your 
agent, you better have a special relationship. It may go beyond a husband-wife 
relationship. You're talking a hell of a lot of money." 
</P>
<P>
 "That's how they obtain their clients; they become their friends," says Gary 
Hughes, the Florida Marlins' director of scouting. "Their first sell job is to 
get the client. That's where all the competition is." 
</P>
<P>
 And the competition is keen because there are plenty of agents. "All you got 
to do to be an agent is say, 'I'm an agent,' " says Tom Grieve, general manager 
of the Rangers. Legions of wanna-bes troll the minor leagues for clients, and 
the players union certifies about 200 to represent the more than 1,000 major 
leaguers. Still, by union estimates, 15 or 20 top agents handle about half of 
those players. 
</P>
<P>
 Moorad is within that elite group, but for his first two years, he says, "I 
lived in fear of the question, 'So who are your clients?' " 
</P>
<P>
 That was 1983, after Moorad had gotten his degrees in political science (UCLA) 
and law (Villanova) and spent a year as a litigation attorney in Newport Beach. 
Then, he turned to sports law. 
</P>
<P>
 Everything about it seemed to fit his temperament, he recalls. 
</P>
<P>
 His father, whose Assyrian parents had fled Persia, was a chief buyer for the 
Gallo wineries in Modesto. He had impressed his son with his negotiating 
abilities. "I learned that the sticker price never really means what it says, 
and there is always a better deal to be had," Moorad says. 
</P>
<P>
 A lawyer uncle became a role model as well. And sports were omnipresent, from 
his grandfather's baseball, to his father's collegiate football and management 
of the respected California (now Modesto) Relays, to his own basketball at 
Modesto's Downey High. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time he reached UCLA, Moorad was interested enough to begin a research 
paper on sports representation. J.D. Morgan, then the school's athletics 
director, referred him to Sam Gilbert, a Los Angeles contractor whose 
maneuverings led to NCAA sanctions against UCLA and a racketeering indictment 
in Florida years later. During Moorad's time at the school, Gilbert handled 
negotiations for some UCLA players' first professional contracts. Watching 
Gilbert, talking to him between phone calls, was the student's introduction to 
the real world of sports negotiation. 
</P>
<P>
 Working from his Newport Beach apartment and contacting every person he knew 
with even the slightest connection to baseball, Moorad struggled to establish a 
stable of clients. After a year, "I'd pieced together some of the finest minor 
league talent you've never heard of." 
</P>
<P>
 But he had also deduced that high schools and colleges were the better hunting 
grounds. And in 1984, some of the best amateurs had gathered in Los Angeles to 
form the U.S. Olympic team. 
</P>
<P>
 Snyder was getting a flurry of calls from 30 to 40 agents and attorneys, and 
Clark was being courted by perhaps 125. Each had taken steps to insulate 
themselves from the rush, but Moorad simply walked up to them. 
</P>
<P>
 His was a very casual, low-key approach, Clark recalls. "It was, 'Hi, I'm 
Jeff. How are you doin'? How's everything going? Mind if I get in touch with 
you and we talk sometime?' He didn't really blow his own horn a lot, and a lot 
of guys were doing that." 
</P>
<P>
 "He just seemed more down-to-earth," Snyder remembers. "The other ones were 
just by-the-book: 'This is the way it's gonna be done.' Also, I wanted someone 
with a sense of humor who would laugh and joke and play with you. He was just 
starting out back them. For some reason, we just hit it off." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The alliance with Snyder, then Clark a year later, put Moorad on baseball's 
mainline. His approach has not changed much over the years, Moorad says. It is 
rooted in the realization that baseball players, or at least those Moorad wants 
as clients, need more from an agent than negotiation skills. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of them are young and naive," the Rangers' Grieve says. "They need a 
lot of help. Sometimes they need a sports psychologist, a marriage counselor. 
To me, an agent who devotes himself just to the contract is not much of an 
agent." 
</P>
<P>
 Moorad puts it more tersely: You lose clients through "lack of attention." 
Some agents even shunt players to an underling, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Which is why Moorad was meeting with the Dodgers' Raul Mondesi, one of 
baseball's hottest rookies. Mondesi was looking for an agent, had heard about 
Moorad in the clubhouse and had expressed interest. 
</P>
<P>
 Moorad was doing little favors, such as researching Mondesi's shoe-endorsement 
contract so he could explain the details. 
</P>
<P>
 "In many cases, a player is more focused on the shift of $2,500 in his shoe 
contract than he is in the shift of $250,000 in his playing contract, because 
there's more real-life significance to that. The concept of having $3,000 of 
free merchandise from Nike versus $5,000 of free merchandise is the difference 
between covering your family at Christmas time with shoes and sweat suits and 
not being able to. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, they can afford to pay for those things, but the concept of free 
merchandise is a magnetic phenomenon. I've always put as much emphasis on, 
shall we say, the lower-level things as I do on the major, because it's all a 
part of maintaining that client relationship." 
</P>
<P>
 So on the Friday before the All-Star game, while negotiations for drafted 
rookies are hanging, most of Moorad's phone calls are for the "little" things. 
</P>
<P>
 * The uncle of a client is getting into a business deal and might want an 
endorsement from a Moorad client. They'll talk later. 
</P>
<P>
 * A player wants an extra hotel room for relatives at the All-Star game. 
Moorad sends his assistant to call the league office. 
</P>
<P>
 * A young pitcher shows up for a visit, and they share hamburgers in the 
office. If a couple of close games had turned around, you would have been in 
the All-Star game, Moorad says. By the way, have you voted yet for the strike? 
Very important. 
</P>
<P>
 * A quarterback calls, and Moorad invites him to the All-Star party. 
</P>
<P>
 * A minor league player calls, and Moorad says he'll arrange for the usual 
supply of shoes and bats. 
</P>
<P>
 * Reporters call to check on contract negotiations. Moorad asks as many 
questions as he answers. Why is the team balking? Who has the power to say 
"yes"? 
</P>
<P>
 * Another player calls and wants to change brands of batting glove. Sure, and 
do you want to try a new brand of sunglasses? 
</P>
<P>
 * A player's relative calls, and Moorad says he's heard the player is drinking 
very heavily. "Not abusive or anything, but just bombed. It's just when you're 
a high-profile athlete, people talk. I thought I might just touch base and flag 
the issue." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Such things are important at Steinberg & Moorad. Clients are expected to 
establish charity and scholarship funds, to act as role models, and to avoid 
the sort of things that bruise and wither playing careers -- like throwing 
firecrackers at fans or turning up in detox units. Yes, it's good PR, and yes, 
it prevents a lot of headaches for an agent, but mostly it's just the right 
thing to do, Moorad says. The kind of clients willing to do it are the kind 
good for the long run, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "He knows what he wants," Snyder says. "He wants a respectable player, one who 
knows what he's doing, not a partyer type. Lots of agents will sign 50, 60 guys 
in the minors and just hope one or two get to the big leagues." 
</P>
<P>
 "The thing about it is, Jeff's got a very good practice but not a huge 
practice," Clark says. "I didn't want to be one of 500 clients. There's only 
one or two guys a year that he picks up. He's big enough, but he's not really, 
really big, so he can still see you on a personal level." 
</P>
<P>
 Even the enemy camp has praise for Moorad, although something of the damning 
kind. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, Jeff's for real, you're darn right," says Quinn of the Giants. "And I 
like Jeff, despite what I feel about agents in general. My underlying feeling 
is, right on the table, they make a hell of a lot of money off players with a 
hell of a lot of talent and can make their entire salary in 12 weeks out of the 
year. And more power to 'em. Sure, they do other things for their players, but 
the good, hard negotiations are 12 weeks. That's it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can truthfully say I'm jealous." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On a Saturday in July, Moorad is entertaining a client, Baltimore Orioles 
outfielder Jeffrey Hammonds, at home on Balboa Island. The living room is 
ornately comfortable, but everyone is upstairs in the small, cluttered 
"apartment" where Jan Moorad has been virtually bedridden for weeks because of 
a difficult pregnancy. 
</P>
<P>
 The remains of a pizza and a pie are on the counter. On a night stand is a 
medical monitor that transmits the unborn baby's vital signs to the hospital. 
How are you doing? Fine, she says, answering the question for perhaps the 20th 
time that day. 
</P>
<P>
 Hammonds and his girlfriend give hugs and goodbys. The phone rings often, and 
Moorad takes some of the calls. He will be off to Miami that night, Pittsburgh 
the next day and back on Wednesday, all the time calling his wife, clients, 
teams, reporters, assistants. 
</P>
<P>
 He takes time out in the living room to explain the reason for it all: "It's 
just a great high to close a deal. I live for those moments of closing a deal 
I'm convinced is pushed to the limit." 
</P>
<P>
 A few days later, Jan Moorad delivers 5-pound, 1-ounce Justin William a month 
prematurely, but he's strong and home with Mother within a few days. Asked 
whether the boy is right- or left-handed, Moorad chuckles. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I'll keep him on my side of the table," he says. "You last longer." 
Jeffrey S. Moorad 
</P>
<P>
 Age: 39. 
</P>
<P>
 Native?: Yes, born and raised in Modesto; lives on Balboa Island in Orange 
County. 
</P>
<P>
 Family: Married to Jan Johnson Moorad; 17-day-old son, Justin William. 
</P>
<P>
 Passions: Basketball, baseball, football and the moment of closing the deal. 
</P>
<P>
 On the pending baseball strike: "Remember that each time a basic agreement is 
negotiated, you have a group of new owners who are convinced that they can 
break the union: 'Hey, why can't we get rid of arbitration, why can't we curb 
free agency?' In reality, they can't, nor should they be able to, and as soon 
as the owners recognize that once again, I think we'll have a basic agreement 
in short order." 
</P>
<P>
 On what's special about sports negotiation: "The difference is you're talking 
about human beings -- players, who many owners and general managers think of as 
commodities when they're not. They're real people. And there are issues that 
apply to the negotiation that are completely distinct from buying or selling a 
car. How a player feels after negotiations is as important as the bottom line." 
</P>
<P>
 On the odds of success: "In baseball, the system flushes away 90% of the 
players. Less than 10% of the players who sign professional contracts make it 
to the major leagues. And think of the kids who give up college, give up an 
opportunity to have an education. You have such mixed feelings."

FIRST PERSON: WHEN SHE PUT THE FRIDGE ON ICE -- A TRUE STORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHELLE WILLIAMS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After nearly a year of a refrigeratorless existence, I broke down recently and 
bought one. 
</P>
<P>
 Your eyeballs aren't deceiving you. You read it right. Fridge. Almost a year. 
Didn't have one. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're kidding, yes?" dinner hosts would ask when I'd politely decline offers 
of doggy bags. A great hush always seemed to blanket the dining room. Soon I 
could hear the whispers: 
</P>
<P>
 "Didja hear? Michelle doesn't have a refrigerator." 
</P>
<P>
 "Can you believe it?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Wonder how can we help." 
</P>
<P>
 Even my cousin offered his two cents. "I can float you a loan," he said, 
followed by the unsaid: And I promise not to tell your mother you've fallen on 
hard times.  
</P>
<P>
 But money wasn't the issue. Nor was my intent -- as some of my more 
ecology-minded buds suggested -- to preserve the environment for future 
generations by producing less trash by buying less food because I was cooking 
less because I was without a fridge. 
</P>
<P>
 Fact is, shortly after Old Fridgy chilled her last leftover chili, I realized 
I could survive quite nicely. Yes, I was a better person without her . . . and 
the evils within: ice cream, Maraschino cherries, whipped cream, walnut sauce. 
</P>
<P>
 So what made me rejoin the cubic footage set? 
</P>
<P>
 Knee surgery, naturally. 
</P>
<P>
 I was about to be one with my orthopedic surgeon, and my mother and sister 
were coming out from New York to nurse me back to health and cater to my every 
junk food need. Since I come from a family with strong refrigerator ties, I 
knew they'd never understand. 
</P>
<P>
 When I was growing up in Queens, our mooching, hungry-as-dieting-wolves 
relatives always knew there was a refrigerator filled with goodies at Mary and 
Sam's house, no matter how often they "just happened to be in the 
neighborhood." Even now when I go home, to open that refrigerator door is to 
discover a treasure trove of homemade soups, leftover collards or a chunk of 
apple pie. 
</P>
<P>
 Go to my sister's house (she's married to a firefighter with a firefighter's 
appetite) and you'll find much of the same. 
</P>
<P>
 So you see, these are people who do not respond kindly to "I don't have a 
refrigerator."  
</P>
<P>
 I could just see it: My sister arrives at my house and eyes the empty vertical 
corner in my kitchen where the fridge once stood. We get to the hospital. She 
pulls Dr. Steve aside just as he's about to enter the operating room and says: 
"Look, there's an extra 20 in it for you if you do a brain scan while you have 
her on the table. Don't know if you know this, but she doesn't have a 
refrigerator." 
</P>
<P>
 Sometime after leaving the nest, my refrigeratored way of thinking changed. I 
saw them for what they were: a temporary haven for ice cream, wine, SlimFast 
and leftover Thai beef salad. 
</P>
<P>
 But when Old Fridgy finally croaked last summer, I had one of those epiphanies 
that accompanies most major catastrophic events: 
</P>
<P>
 Did I really need to be drinking that much wine? 
</P>
<P>
 How about all that former cow and those hot chili peppers in my pre-middle-age 
innards? 
</P>
<P>
 And perhaps, just perhaps, the time had come to drink SlimFast without the two 
scoops of Rocky Road. 
</P>
<P>
 Since there had rarely been anything else in the fridge (I prefer 
room-temperature water, I eat salads at work and I'd rather die than eat an 
egg), I went without. 
</P>
<P>
 July, August, September and October went smoothly. Never one to remember my 
birth date without looking it up, I was amazed at my ability to retain 
everything take-out: restaurant names, phone numbers, menus, hours of 
operation, names of deliverers. If I ordered too much, I simply wrapped the 
remains and made a donation to the homeless of Venice. 
</P>
<P>
 Then came Thanksgiving Day dinner at a friend's house and the inevitable 
question: "Would you like to take some turkey home with you?" 
</P>
<P>
 Having learned by now that society tends to question the sanity of a person 
who should have a refrigerator but doesn't, I explained that I was on a diet. 
It had finally happened: I had become a refrigerator liar. 
</P>
<P>
 But as is the case when you call work on a hot, sunny day and say you can't 
come in because your car broke down (and you go to the beach instead) and the 
next day your car really does break down, weeks later I found I really needed 
to lose weight to squeeze into a maid-of-honor dress that was obviously a small 
Size 14. 
</P>
<P>
 Suddenly being without a refrigerator had a purpose. I was doing it for Holly. 
Yeah, that was it. The bride. My pro-refrigerator friends accepted that. The 
societal pressure to have a refrigerator temporarily let up. 
</P>
<P>
 Once the wedding passed, though (and I burned the anaconda-like girdle that 
enabled me to sit down during the reception), nagging feelings nipped at me. If 
only I had a refrigerator, then I could have saved that lovely gardenia corsage 
from the wedding. If only I had a refrigerator, I could have dinner guests over 
more often (not everyone has a palate for warm Zinfandel). If only I had had a 
refrigerator, I could have baked Christmas cookies. 
</P>
<P>
 Then came the need for surgery and the need for family and the need for a 
refrigerator. 
</P>
<P>
 I have to admit, it was good to stroll through the refrigerated section of the 
supermarket again. To sashay up the freezer aisle and wave at the cartons of 
ice cream. Hello, Ben. Hello, Jerry. Smooches, Dreyer's. Hug-hug, you Dove 
bars, you. 
</P>
<P>
 I didn't go hog-wild on my first trip out. My purchase was small: Two cans of 
SlimFast, half a gallon of milk and a box of Frosted Flakes to go with the 
milk. 
</P>
<P>
 These days, I'm back on the ice cream trail. (Walking to the freezer was very 
therapeutic for my knee.) And of course, I'm doing the L.A. thing and sharing 
my tale with others. 
</P>
<P>
 When I felt comfortable enough to tell a friend the whole ugly story, she 
shook her head and, after a moment of silence, said: "I can't believe it!" 
</P>
<P>
 "It's true," I said, hanging my head at the appropriate level of shame. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't believe it," she repeated in a chiding, high-pitched voice that 
knocked at the door of hysteria. "You eat Frosted Flakes with milk! I eat them 
right out of the box." 
</P>
<P>
 Who needs the brain scan now, huh? 
</P>
<P>
 Having learned by now that society tends to question the sanity of a person 
who should have a refrigerator but doesn't, I explained that I was on a diet. 
It had finally happened: I had become a refrigerator liar.

GALLERY: THE CARTOON TOUR

 Tony Mostrom calls his vision of Hollywood Boulevard a lament for a lost 
love."I've lived (in Los Angeles) all my life," says the 36-year-old free-lance 
cartoonist, whose work has graced the pages of Heavy Metal and R. Crumb's 
Weirdo magazines. "I used to enjoy going to Hollywood Boulevard. I don't enjoy 
it anymore." Mostrom misses strolling Hollywood and browsing its bookshops. He 
worked on the boulevard and once lived at Yucca and Cahuenga ("one of the worst 
corners"). There have been efforts to revitalize the neighborhood, but Mostrom 
remains unconvinced. "The charm," he says, is gone.

SOCIAL CLIMES / UP ALL NIGHT: PLEASE CHECK TESTOSTERONE AT THE DOOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK EHRMAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In case it's not immediately obvious from its name, Utero is a venue that 
focuses on all things female. This "throbbing womb of a club" invades Woody's 
Hyperion in Silver Lake on Thursday nights, transforming the neighborhood bar 
and disco into a churning, multi-sensory, estrogen-fueled Babylon. 
</P>
<P>
 "We thought Silver Lake needed something for the community that we like to 
hang out in -- which is the artistic community, the music community and the 
lesbian community," says Maria Boyd, who started Utero with partner Katie 
Childe last month. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted to create a space where all of these different types of people 
could come and interact and have a good time and appreciate female artists," 
Boyd says. 
</P>
<P>
 Utero showcases one or two female artists every week. The club has had -- or 
is scheduled to have -- performance artists, belly dancers, a lesbian comedian, 
bands and individual musicians. On the walls are projected still and video 
pieces from local visual artists. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maria is a photographer/performance artist and I'm a musician," Childe says. 
"I get a lot of the musicians who come here. She gets the performance art. And 
it works out really well." 
</P>
<P>
 The club draws a predominantly -- but far from exclusively -- lesbian 
clientele, heavy on hard-core Mohawk/Modern Primitive, who party all evening to 
nonstop techno and ultra-alternative dance music. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is about the only place you can go when you're a lesbian where people 
won't point and laugh if you're pierced and tattooed," says Jett, who has been 
coming to Utero with her girlfriend since it began. "It's the only place you 
can come and be comfortable. It's like going home," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Visual artist Maggie Parr celebrated her 27th birthday with an exhibition at 
Utero. "It's pretty surreal," she says, her art-and-text flashing on the wall 
while Farhana the belly dancer undulates for the dollar-waving crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 Striking an even more hedonistic note are Utero's roster of go-go dancers. 
These fantasy grrrls run the gamut from the gender-blurred to scantily clad 
supervixens. They whip up the crowd into a frenzy. 
</P>
<P>
 "We look for a good body, lots of creative expression, very sexy style and 
cool, unique outfits," Boyd says of Utero's dancers. 
</P>
<P>
 And the women here, regardless of sexual orientation, appreciate the effort. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you want beautiful go-go girls, this is the place," says another Utero 
regular, Stacy Lande, a painter whose work was showcased here previously. 
</P>
<P>
 The XY crowd need not feel left out, as long as they know how to keep their 
testosterone in check. "Oh, certainly, this place is for everybody," Boyd says. 
"I like to think of men in touch with their feminine side as being totally 
welcome here." 
</P>
<P>
 * Where: Utero, Woody's Hyperion, 2810 Hyperion Ave., Silver Lake; (213) 
953-9069. 
</P>
<P>
 * When: 9 p.m. to 2 a.m. Thursdays. 
</P>
<P>
 * Admission: $3.

SOCIAL CLIMES / THE BUZZ: THE KATO WATCH

<TEXT>
<P>
 It hasn't been easy waiting for the O.J. Channel to start up again. What is it 
now, six weeks until the trial? 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, we're suffering painful withdrawal symptoms, relieved only by the 
occasional news bitlet, weary commentary or rehashing of things we already 
know. 
</P>
<P>
 But we've found something else to help us get through these long, torturous 
days: Kato sightings. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, Brian (Kato) Kaelin, O.J.'s befuddled-looking, non-rent-paying McDonald's 
companion has not been keeping that low a profile. So far he's been spotted at 
the Beverly Hills Health and Fitness Gym in Los Angeles (evenings mostly) and 
at the Hotel Nikko in Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Was Kato perhaps in deal-making mode at the hotel? After all, what producer 
wouldn't want to sign up this guy? And if art truly imitates life, then we 
should see Kato playing himself in one of the many O.J. movies coming soon to a 
television set near you. We also think he'd be perfect as everyone's favorite 
little buddy in a revival of "Gilligan's Island." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 What a drag: We've had a spate of Westerns ("Tombstone," "Wyatt Earp," "Bad 
Girls") and now it's time for something completely different. 
</P>
<P>
 How about a spate of movies featuring performers in drag? "Just Like a Woman" 
is now in release, and currently filming is "To Wong Foo, Thanks for 
Everything, Julie Newmar." Premiering next week is "The Adventures of 
Priscilla, Queen of the Desert," about three Australian drag-queen showgirls 
who hit the road in a bus named Priscilla. 
</P>
<P>
 The invitation for the event on Tuesday reads, "If the shoe fits . . . wear it 
to our party," so we wondered if that meant drag was de rigueur for the soiree. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not required," said a spokesman, "but I have a feeling some people will 
be in drag." 
</P>
<P>
 Cast members will definitely be en drag , and they'll arrive on Priscilla for 
all the world -- and paparazzi -- to see. The event is a benefit for L.A. 
Shanti, which provides free education and emotional support services to those 
with HIV/AIDS (some tickets may still be available, call (213) 386-8014). 
Following a screening at the Cinerama Dome is a party at The Palace, with 
Thelma Houston performing live. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Move over, Rover: Taking your dog to the dog park is no longer the cool way to 
show off your pooch. We encountered a young man the other day strolling down 
the street with his canine while strumming an electric guitar that was, 
needless to say, not plugged in. Who knows, maybe they'll both get discovered.

 Zubin Mehta is flying in from Israel. Esa-Pekka Salonen will also conduct. 
Gregory Peck has consented to be master of ceremonies. And Melissa Manchester 
will appear. Glamour. Glamour. Glamour. It's the 75th anniversary celebration

 Opera Opening: Gala co-chairs Alice Coulombe and Peggy Parker Grauman 
announced musically savvy plans to their Opening Night Committee of the Los 
Angeles Music Center Opera's 1994-'95 season at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion. 
The occasion was luncheon at the Yves Saint Laurent boutique on Rodeo Drive.  
</P>
<P>
 The opera season opens Sept. 9 with "Faust," and remember Gounod set the music 
to Goethe's classic version of the story of a man who sells his soul to the 
devil. That's why the co-chairs, on the invitation, say, "Mephistopheles wishes 
to strike a bargain with you. . . ." The bargain: For $650 each, dining and 
dancing on the Music Center Plaza . . . and black tie, or devil red, if you 
wish. The lunch was the chance for YSL Director Beatrice Cederstom to preview 
the YSL Rive Gauche fall collection.

Ballroom, showcasing the most beautiful evening designs seen on the New York 
and European runways in the fall collections. Editing the Saks collection: 
Vincent Knoll, director of couture. A fashionably intense crowd inspected every 
stitch of the bouffant ball gowns and body-skimming columns. Some scurried back 
to Saks to buy over champagne.

LIBRARIES CAN HELP TURN KIDS AROUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Randy Lewis' feature interview with author Gary Paulsen ("He Owes It All to 
Librarians and Dogs," July 31) was indeed a noteworthy piece on the struggles 
and accomplishments of the talented writer. 
</P>
<P>
 Of particular worth were Paulsen's significant comment on the need to help 
today's youth survive, and his recognition of libraries and librarians as 
institutions that have great and far-reaching potential to help children and 
often turn around lives of those who are adrift. 
</P>
<P>
 In current times when libraries are losing funding, we must continually be 
reminded of the importance of keeping our libraries alive and healthy.

STILL GRIEVING FOR A VERY SPECIAL WOMAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 My mother died 39 years ago, when I was 22. She was 47. She developed breast 
cancer when I was a college freshman.I did not know any of this until I 
returned home on a summer break from the University of Wisconsin. 
</P>
<P>
 In those days, families (at least mine) were very secretive. We never talked 
to her, or even about her among ourselves, about her "condition." We thought we 
were fooling everyone, but indeed we fooled no one, least of all my mother who 
desperately needed our truth and support. 
</P>
<P>
 Your article, "Motherless Daughters" (July 27) brought it all back, right 
here, staring me in the face, causing tears and terrible sadness. 
</P>
<P>
 My worst times in the early years following her death were when I saw a mother 
and daughter out together . . . shopping, dining, at a movie. It's easier now, 
at 60, when many friends have lost mothers. 
</P>
<P>
 Although, my aunt, my mother's sister, took over a "mothering" role in my 
life, it's never the same. We both know it because we still grieve for a woman 
very special to both of us.

HOPING CHATTERTON'S CAN SURVIVE THE ODDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Re "Don't Write Chatterton's Finale Yet" (July 29), I well remember when 
Chatterton's opened in the early 1970s, a welcome place to patronize for lovers 
of offbeat literature and magazines. 
</P>
<P>
 I was out of Los Angeles during the mid-'70s, but when I returned in late 
1976, Chatterton's was in its heyday.A beacon for bohemians of all stripes, it 
seemed always crowded to the brim on weekend afternoons. In that bygone era 
when flirting was more acceptable to both sexes, Chatterton's had quite a 
reputation as a pick-up spot for a date or even meeting that special someone 
for a longer-term relationship. 
</P>
<P>
 Since that time, Chatterton's has had its ups and downs. I sincerely hope it 
can survive through this down period and find better years ahead. Viva 
Chatterton's!

WESTSIDE WATCH: JERRY RUBIN, PROTESTERS WAGE SIT-IN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Most days, Jerry Rubin stands up for peace. On Thursday, he sat down for a 
table. 
</P>
<P>
 Rubin, a longtime peace activist who operates an informational and vending 
booth on the Venice Beach boardwalk, is upset about a new pilot program that, 
among other things, seeks to regulate the size of the tables political and 
charity groups set up on the western side of the walkway. 
</P>
<P>
 So on Thursday, he led a sit-in at the Westchester offices of Los Angeles City 
Councilwoman Ruth Galanter. During an impromptu press conference, where Rubin 
claimed the program violated vendors' free speech rights, he and two other 
boardwalk denizens -- Jingles (a vegetarian activist) and Jack Herer (of 
H.E.M.P., a group pushing for the legalization of marijuana) -- were quickly 
outnumbered by members of the media. 
</P>
<P>
 "These ordinances . . . are unrealistic, unnecessary, unconstitutional, 
unenforceable and un-Venice," Rubin declared. 
</P>
<P>
 Galanter aide Niki Tenant met briefly with the protesters and said the 
councilwoman would schedule a talk with them in a week or so. This did not 
satisfy Rubin, who vowed to wage the sit-in even after the office closed at 5 
p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't want to pack this place with people," Rubin said. "We've got 
important things to do. I could be out stamping people with my rubber peace 
symbol."

 STICKER SHOCK: Gary Johns was outside of his West Hollywood home last 
Wednesday morning, trying to sell his father's burgundy Chevrolet Camaro to 
Frank Amador. The pair had just returned from a test drive and were sitting in 
the car, discussing its merits. 
</P>
<P>
 But they looked pretty suspicious to one of Johns' neighbors, who promptly 
called the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department to report that someone was 
trying to steal the car. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputies arrived in a rush, and proceeded to administer what the department 
calls its "felony approach." Guns were drawn and Johns and Amador were ordered 
out of the Camaro and were placed in handcuffs. 
</P>
<P>
 At that point, deputies listened to Johns' explanation -- that he was only 
trying to sell his dad's car. Johns, head of his street's Neighborhood Watch 
program, said he was glad that a neighbor called if she thought a crime was 
being committed. But, he said, the deputies should have realized that he and 
Amador were harmless. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know how it could be construed the car was being stolen when we were 
just sitting there," said Johns, who has since filed a complaint now being 
reviewed by the Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Lt. Lee Jordan: "We responded to an alleged felony in progress." 
</P>
<P>
 Amador said he had been looking at Johns' car to replace his own car, which 
had recently been stolen. In the end, though, he decided to look elsewhere for 
wheels. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Amador: "If that car is going to attract that kind of attention, I don't 
want it." 
</P>

<P>
 COUNTING THE VOTES: City Councilman Kelly Olsen, who is seeking the 
all-important endorsement of the city's dominant renter's rights group today, 
will have to do so without help from former Mayor Dennis Zane. 
</P>
<P>
 Zane said he is passing over Olsen in favor of three other candidates he 
prefers: Councilman Tony Vazquez, Planning Commissioner Pam O'Connor and Arts 
Commission member Bruria Finkel. 
</P>
<P>
 This does not bode well for Olsen. Zane is an influential leader of Santa 
Monicans for Renters' Rights, and his judgment is respected by the 
organization's members. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, the group has never denied an endorsement to a council 
incumbent who is one of its members. And since these things are decided based 
on who can get the most loyalists to show up at the convention, anything can -- 
and usually does -- happen. 
</P>
<P>
 Zane said Olsen is fourth on his list and a "fine candidate" whom he will 
support later if the group picks him.

SEARCHING FOR THE LINE BETWEEN POLICY, POLICING IN SANTA MONICA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 How now, black-and-white cows? 
</P>
<P>
 That was, more or less, the question posed a few months back by Santa Monica 
Councilman Ken Genser, who wondered if that cow mural painted on Ben & Jerry's 
ice cream store ran afield of the city's sign ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Councilman Kelly Olsen wanted car dealerships to stop flying 
balloons and little American flags from the vehicles for sale. 
</P>
<P>
 These are some examples of about three dozen formal complaints to city 
building and safety officials against businesses that City Council members have 
registered in the past few years. 
</P>
<P>
 Such complaints, the vast majority of which have been filed by Olsen, have 
drawn criticism from some that council members are micro-managing by getting 
into regulation rather than only making policy. 
</P>
<P>
 "You'd think they'd have something better to do, wouldn't you?" said auto 
dealer Walter Parr, who removed the three American flags displayed on cars 
after an Olsen-instigated complaint, but denied there were balloons. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members, though, say they are just doing their job. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think neighbors should suffer the effects of a business operating 
illegally, (even though) a business is bringing in tax dollars," said Olsen, 
who is himself a neighbor of Santa Monica Boulevard car dealers. He is 
responsible for about 30 of the complaints (including a few repeat complaints 
against the same dealer). 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the complaints reviewed resulted in warnings or citations; in others 
no violations were found. 
</P>
<P>
 City Planning Director Suzanne Frick cautioned that there may be more 
complaints on file that were not uncovered during a search requested by The 
Times, a difficult process because the reports are filed by address, not name. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the complaints from Olsen cover a variety of potential infractions by 
various types of merchants, he gave special scrutiny to the city's automobile 
dealers and auto repair shops. 
</P>
<P>
 A slew of dealers were written up for such offenses as having balloons on cars 
or flying pennants above their lots. One Olsen complaint about Claude Short 
Dodge accused the dealer of having small, plastic American flags flying from 
radio antennas -- a breach, however minor, of the city's code. Olsen turned in 
Katie's Pet Depot on Wilshire Boulevard for excessive banners and balloons. 
</P>
<P>
 Frick said these decorations were banned in the city in the mid-1980s as being 
unsightly. When a city building inspector called the Dodge dealer, co-owner 
Parr confessed to having three American flags, but no balloons. Parr said in an 
interview that the flags were sent to him by the Chrysler Corp. as part of a 
buy-American car promotion. 
</P>
<P>
 The dealers said they viewed the complaints as indicative of a political 
climate unfriendly to business. The attention was deemed especially unwelcome 
in a tough economic climate. 
</P>
<P>
 Automobile dealers are the No. 3 source of business revenue to the city, 
surpassed only by hotels and restaurants, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems a little odd that a city council member would want to run around 
inspecting to see whether anyone has balloons on their cars," said Wayne 
Harding, general manager of Santa Monica Ford. 
</P>
<P>
 Chamber of Commerce President Graham Pope said the complaints are emblematic 
of the "attitude by some council members that they have the right to 
micro-manage the city." 
</P>
<P>
 Olsen said that some of his complaints were initiated by him, but that most 
were made on behalf of residents. 
</P>
<P>
 The only difference between him and other council members is that he signs his 
names to complaints, while the others funnel them in a more circumspect way 
through the city manager's office, Olsen said. 
</P>
<P>
 Word of Olsen's high number of complaints leaked out months ago, but city 
officials initially balked at providing documentation, saying it was necessary 
to protect the identity of complainants. When renewed requests for the records 
were made recently by The Times, City Atty. Marsha Jones Moutrie released them. 
</P>
<P>
 This is not the first time Olsen has become embroiled in controversy over the 
way he views his council role. 
</P>
<P>
 A year-and-a-half ago, Olsen had to be counseled by the city manager on the 
proper boundaries for a council member after he told a traffic control officer 
at an accident scene to "get out in the intersection and better direct the 
traffic" and demanded a police escort on one of his forays to videotape drug 
dealers in Palisades Park. Fire union officials also complained that he 
buttonholed them to discuss city politics while they were on duty. 
</P>
<P>
 More recently, police officials said they saw Olsen drive through the middle 
of a drug undercover operation, as part of his effort to track the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 In all cases, Olsen denied any untoward behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I'm being charged with paying attention to what's going on, I plead 
guilty," Olsen once said. 
</P>
<P>
 As for those black-and-white cows painted on Ben & Jerry's wall, Genser said 
they fell in a gray area. According to the complaint form, he asked that a 
picture of the mural be forwarded to the city attorney for a legal answer to 
the question: Are they art or are they advertising? 
</P>
<P>
 The ice cream store has, meanwhile, filed for a permit that would resolve the 
bovine beef by bestowing mural status on the cows. 
</P>

A MOTIVATING FORCE; EDUCATION: BUSINESSWOMAN GIVES VENICE STUDENTS KNOWLEDGE 
THAT ISN'T IN THE TEXTBOOKS: HOW TO SET GOALS AND ACHIEVE THEM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The students in the Venice High summer school class were fidgety. Some were 
cracking wads of bubble gum in their mouths. Others laughed at a class clown's 
antics. But when the visiting teacher asked what they expected out of their 
lives, they started paying more attention. 
</P>
<P>
 "What is your goal?" asked Linda Tisherman, smiling as she strode around the 
classroom, delivering an up-tempo talk in the manner of a motivational speaker. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to learn English better so I can go to college," replied 16-year-old 
Erica Martinez. 
</P>
<P>
 "OK," said Tisherman, president of Staff Support, a Westside temporary 
employment agency. "Now write down when you graduate, and the year you want to 
enter college. Then, what will you have to do to learn English?" 
</P>
<P>
 Within minutes, Erica had the beginnings of a game plan. The 10th-grader 
reported to the class that she will converse more with English speakers, read 
more books and enter college by 1997. 
</P>
<P>
 "What are we gaining in this class?" asked Tisherman. 
</P>
<P>
 "Knowledge," replied the 25 students, almost in unison. 
</P>
<P>
 "And what happens when you get out in the real world with that knowledge?" 
</P>
<P>
 "You have power," chirped the students. 
</P>
<P>
 For two hours each week, 10th-grade summer school students take a break from a 
morning-long English class for a two-hour session with Tisherman. Her program 
contains all the trappings of a motivational seminar, from the name tags the 
students and Tisherman wear to the discussion of success and how to achieve it. 
</P>
<P>
 Last spring, Tisherman taught a "Job Readiness" course at Venice High. That 
class, and this summer's six-week "Student Motivation" course, are part of a 
program developed by the National Assn. of Temporary Services. The program 
assists students at risk of dropping out of school by encouraging them to 
continue their education and helps them prepare to compete in the job market. 
</P>
<P>
 In the motivation course, students are introduced to the most essential and 
practical of life skills: setting targets. 
</P>
<P>
 During one class meeting, Tisherman went around the room, asking students to 
set short-term goals (earning A's in the English final) and long-term goals 
(college and career). 
</P>
<P>
 There is no room for daydreams here. When students tell Tisherman about a 
goal, she pushes them to set a target date. Once the date is set, she asks them 
to think about what action is needed to accomplish the goal. 
</P>
<P>
 Tisherman's optimism, said the students, is infectious and necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't get to talk to people like that, who are so positive," said Amir 
Mikhiael, 16. Setting goals and learning how to follow through, said Amir, an 
aspiring engineer, "is the most important thing I've learned."

ANALYSIS; SANTA MONICA COUNCIL MAY PAY THE PRICE ON PETITION; PANEL MEMBERS 
COULD CALL FOR A COSTLY SPECIAL ELECTION ON GET-TOUGH PROPOSALS ON THE 
HOMELESS. A REFUSAL TO PLACE MEASURE ON THE BALLOT MAY SPARK A POLITICAL 
BACKLASH.

<P>
 The Santa Monica City Council majority backed by the renters' rights group 
that dominates local politics faces a big political gamble Tuesday when it 
considers a 12,000-signature petition demanding a vote on proposed get-tough 
homeless policies. 
</P>
<P>
 Petition organizers, who are longtime opponents of Santa Monicans for Renters' 
Rights, want to put the law-and-order proposals on the November ballot. To do 
that they need the verified signatures of 10% of Santa Monica voters, or about 
5,400 signatures. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposals would cap or reduce spending on homeless services, close city 
parks at night and restrict panhandling in some places, including within 50 
feet of automated teller machines. The City Council has already approved many 
of the measures, including the park closure and panhandling restrictions, but 
petition organizers still hope to force a ballot measure. Approval by 
referendum would mean the seven-member council would need a 6-1 vote to reverse 
the laws, rather than a simple majority. 
</P>
<P>
 Petition organizers missed an early July deadline for turning in the 
signatures in time to get the measure on the November ballot. City Clerk 
Clarice Dykhouse says she doubts there's enough time to verify all the 
signatures before Tuesday's council meeting, the last chance the board will 
have to consider the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 That leaves the council majority with a few alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
 Option one: Council members could assume that the petition has enough valid 
signatures and put it on the ballot, saving the city the expense of a special 
election. The political downside? The petition would give opponents of the 
renters' group a campaign issue and a tool to get out the vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Three council seats are up in the November election. Incumbents Tony Vazquez 
and Kelly Olsen are allied with Santa Monicans for Renters' Rights, while 
Robert Holbrook is backed by the petition organizers. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're more concerned about having a platform to ride on," Olsen said. "It's 
a political movement for political candidates." 
</P>
<P>
 Option two: The council could ignore the petitions and let the deadline pass. 
The downside? The piles of signatures, an indicator of public sentiment, won't 
go away. 
</P>
<P>
 Another possibility would be a special election, but that would require the 
signatures of 15% of voters, or about 8,100 signatures. Organizers say they 
turned in 12,108, but often many signatures are disqualified because they're 
illegible, the signer is not a Santa Monica voter or other irregularities. 
</P>
<P>
 If enough signatures did qualify, however, the council could be forced to 
spend about $120,000 for a special election and wrestle with a divisive 
referendum a month or two after the November election. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Ken Genser is inclined to take that chance. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be a very dangerous precedent to say, 'We're turning (a petition) in 
right before the election, but we don't have time to verify it, but put it on 
the ballot anyway,' " he said.

COMMUNITY NEWS: BEVERLY HILLS; CITY PRODUCES ITS OWN FARMERS' MARKET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Casting aside its normally sophisticated air, Beverly Hills is going to take 
on a down-home look today with the opening of the city's first weekly farmers' 
market. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty-five farmers will be setting up tables and selling their home-grown 
fruits, vegetables and flowers on the 300 block of North Canon Drive in the 
city's business district, from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 "The market will attract city residents and provide a spirit of community, as 
well as draw out-of-area shoppers to what has been a sleepy street on Sunday 
mornings," said Beverly Hills Councilman Tom Levyn, who initiated the idea for 
a farmers' market."This is going to be a very enjoyable weekly event." 
</P>
<P>
 The usual variety of tomatoes, string beans and bell peppers will be 
available, in addition to organic and exotic produce including Asian pears, 
quail and goose eggs, and edible flowers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're mainly focusing on quality. We're getting what we feel is the cream of 
the crop of farmers, and they are going to bring their best produce," said 
market manager Gale Trachtenberg. "One grower," she added, "is bringing in 
about 15 varieties of sprouts." 
</P>
<P>
 A brief opening ceremony is scheduled for 10:30 a.m., with Beverly Hills Mayor 
Vicki Reynolds foregoing the usual ribbon-cutting to officiate a 
"carrot-breaking." A Dixieland-style jazz band and children's activities will 
also be featured for the opening day. 
</P>
<P>
 The Beverly Hills Farmers' Market will be similar in size to the markets held 
Thursdays in Westwood and Saturdays in downtown Santa Monica.

RECREATION; TAKING MATTERS INTO HAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LINDA FELDMAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ever see a smiling jogger? Ever have a nightmare that your personal trainer 
taught you to heel? Going deaf from the rap music playing at your aerobic 
workout? 
</P>
<P>
 Get thee to a dojo. 
</P>
<P>
 You'll get exercise, development of mind and body, and a philosophy with 
emphasis on humility, self-discipline and self-growth. And you'll also learn to 
defend yourself. It's called karate-do (literally translated: empty-handed). 
</P>
<P>
 The three-decade-old West Los Angeles Karate School provides everything except 
the commercialism and the military atmosphere commonly found at dojos that 
admit children. This dojo (place of the way) is strictly for grown-ups. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a club atmosphere rather than a formal school," said manager David 
Heldman. "We don't need push-ups to punish people because we get our own 
'push-ups' in our outside world." Heldman takes no salary, the school is 
nonprofit and black belt members share the teaching duties. 
</P>
<P>
 In real life, Heldman is a salesman for a documentary film company, and at the 
dojo he teaches the beginning class to a group of students whose average age is 
48 and whose occupations range from a restaurant builder to a federal judge. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Joseph Reichman of the U.S. District Court is never going to co-star in 
a Ninja Turtle movie, nor does he plan on using karate in his courtroom. But he 
is learning this weapon-less style of self-defense as a form of pleasurable 
exercise. 
</P>
<P>
 Up to three years ago, Reichman, 63, was doing a lot of running. 
</P>
<P>
 "I came to the conclusion I was hurting myself. I never had that mythical high 
runners talk about and after 14 years of races and marathons I realized it held 
no joy for me," he said after an intense one-hour workout. 
</P>
<P>
 Reichman recently underwent serious surgery and incorporated what he learned 
in karate-do in his recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 "I used the technique of focusing on the most important element to aid in my 
recovery," he said. "I know I'll never be a black belt, but I also know that I 
want to struggle with it anyway and I see myself doing it as long as I can." 
</P>
<P>
 Reichman considers himself a quiet person who wouldn't step on an ant if he 
could avoid it. He fits right in with the other members. There's a friendly, 
civilized atmosphere. It is not a business. There are no contracts to sign. No 
one looks or acts threatening -- in fact, quite the opposite. There is almost a 
spiritual feeling in spite of the physical intensity. 
</P>
<P>
 According to M. Nakayama in the introduction to his book "Best Karate," if 
karate is practiced solely as a fighting technique, it is regrettable -- the 
spiritual aspect plays the predominant role. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the ancient Okinawan martial art had as its objective to inflict 
devastating damage on an opponent with one blow of the fist or a single kick, 
training means training of body and spirit and, according to Nakayama, "one 
should treat his opponent courteously and with the proper etiquette. It is not 
enough to fight with all one's power; the real objective in karate-do is to do 
so for the sake of justice." 
</P>
<P>
 Alan Weil, third-degree black belt, or sandan, as it is called in Japanese, 
uses karate theory in his work as a litigation lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Karate is about how we deal with conflict, defending yourself against 
multiple threats, but the biggest obstacle is internal fear," Weil said. "The 
Japanese have a saying that Samurai would put their fear on the tips of their 
swords and carry their fear with them outside -- in front of them. It's not 
that you have no fear, it's that you recognize it as a part of yourself, but it 
does not stop you from taking action." 
</P>
<P>
 Ana Mancia designs clothes for Barbie dolls. She's been studying karate for 
three years. Her designs for karate martial arts clothes for Barbie's little 
sister were recently turned down. 
</P>
<P>
 "My place of work is very stressful. This is a place for stress to come out in 
aggression," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Restaurant builder Tom Wetherford, 49, says karate has influenced his life 
deeply. "The way I walk down the street -- I'm aware of everything going on. My 
lower back pain is gone because I even learned how to walk differently . . . 
and don't forget we're learning how to kill with one blow, just in case." 
</P>
<P>
 The West Los Angeles Karate School is at 11054 West Pico Blvd. (310) 473-6610.

COMMUNITY NEWS: WESTWOOD; BABY BOY SURVIVES RARE HEART TRANSPLANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUG ALGER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A rare heart transplant performed for the first time at UCLA Medical Center 
has given an infant boy a new chance at life. 
</P>
<P>
 David Henry Patt, son of Roy and Sarah Patt of Santa Clarita, was born July 19 
with an underdeveloped left heart ventricle. He was 16 days old Wednesday, when 
doctors successfully replaced his heart with that of a 4-day-old infant. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite having the largest heart transplant program in the country, the 
early-morning operation was the first time doctors at UCLA have performed a 
neonatal heart transplant. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are just a few centers in the country that do neonatal transplants, so 
it's still very rare," said Dr. Hillel Laks, the medical center's chief of 
cardiac surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 The baby's parents said in an interview that they are thankful not only for 
the doctors who performed the four-hour operation, but also for the anonymous, 
out-of-state family that agreed to donate the heart from their newborn infant, 
who had died. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel grateful that someone was able to give the gift of life during their 
time of tragedy," said Sarah Patt, 27. 
</P>
<P>
 "Somewhere along the line, somebody lost a baby," said Roy Patt, 36. "It would 
be very difficult to let somebody take your precious, newborn baby, even when 
you know it's for a good thing." 
</P>
<P>
 The Patts said they have been fortunate throughout their experience, from when 
they first learned of David's heart defect by accident, to this week when the 
donated heart became available -- one day before doctors were prepared to 
proceed with a riskier surgical procedure. 
</P>
<P>
 The Patts first discovered the baby's heart defect when Sarah, a fifth-grade 
teacher at Sulphur Springs Elementary School, went to UCLA Medical Center for a 
belated ultrasound examination during the 26th week of her pregnancy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Things were so strange that we found out at all," said Roy Patt, who works as 
a printing broker. "We probably wouldn't be here at all if it weren't for a 
series of flukes that put us in a better position than most people" of knowing. 
</P>
<P>
 Sarah Patt's doctors had three choices -- abort the baby, proceed with a 
surgery to reconstruct the heart's aorta to link it solely to the right 
ventricle or wait for a donated heart for a transplant. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the survival rate is three times higher for a transplant patient -- 
near 90% -- it can only be attempted when a donated heart becomes available. 
After two difficult weeks, the Patts received word of a possible donor from 
outside California -- one day before doctors planned to go ahead with the 
other, less successful procedure. 
</P>
<P>
 Barring a rejection of the new heart, doctors expect David to live a normal 
life. The only accommodation that must be made to his transplanted heart will 
be a regular injection of immunosuppressant drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 The procedure, including a two-week stay at the medical center's intensive 
care unit, is estimated to cost more than $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The Patts expect to bring baby David home in a week or so. DOUG ALGER

COMMUNITY NEWS: MARINA DEL REY; SHARED MANAGEMENT DEAL APPROVED FOR CITY CLUB 
CONDO COMPLEX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN BUZBEE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Despite the protests of some Marina City Club condominium owners, including 
Los Angeles City Councilman Nate Holden, a federal bankruptcy judge has agreed 
to a reorganization plan that allows the developer and homeowners to share 
management of the troubled waterfront complex. 
</P>
<P>
 The homeowners association and lawyers for the partnership led by developer 
Jerome Snyder agreed to the plan Wednesday. Holden and a lawyer for two dozen 
other homeowners had asked U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Samuel Bufford for more time 
to work out a better deal for the homeowners, who contend that lax management 
since the bankruptcy filing in 1992 has caused their property values to tumble 
by up to 50%. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every person is being hurt, even the people who just want to get it over 
with," said Holden, who said he splits his time between the condo and his legal 
residence in Southwest Los Angeles. He said he bought the condo after anonymous 
death threats in the wake of the Rodney G. King beating. 
</P>
<P>
 "They recognize they're being hurt, but they want a solution, no matter what," 
Holden said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Bufford said bankruptcy court proceedings can often be unsatisfactory to 
all parties. 
</P>
<P>
 "It isn't going to be all the gold in Fort Knox," he said. "It's only going to 
be a small portion of it. It's fairly typical for a good settlement to have 
nobody happy." 
</P>
<P>
 The partnership behind the Marina del Rey development filed for Chapter 11 
protection after defaulting on a $24-million loan from Aetna. Homeowners, the 
partnership and Aetna have been working on a reorganization plan ever since. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the plan, a committee composed of two homeowners and two representatives 
of the partnership will share management of the 600-unit complex, which had 
been managed exclusively by the partnership. 
</P>
<P>
 J. Elliot McIntosh, a lawyer for homeowners opposed to the plan, argued that 
it did not spell out a way to resolve complaints about noise from trash chutes 
and an exercise room. 
</P>
<P>
 Bufford replied that although there were no guarantees the problems would be 
solved, the plan sufficiently addressed them. 
</P>
<P>
 In a court-sponsored, advisory referendum on the plan, Bufford tossed out more 
than 200 votes against it because an opposition group led by homeowner Richard 
Annotico funneled the ballots to the lawyers responsible for counting them. 
</P>
<P>
 Bufford said Annotico tampered with some of the ballots, but Annotico said he 
only tried to help his neighbors understand how to fill them out because they 
didn't trust the developers' lawyers to count the ballots accurately, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Shirley Bailey, president of the board of the homeowners' association, 
said most homeowners approved of the deal. After Bufford tossed out the 
disputed ballots, the vote in the referendum was 227 for and 68 against. JOHN

COVER STORY; BY WORD OF MOUTH; CULTURE: A LONGING DESIRE FOR MORE MEANINGFUL 
SOCIAL RELATIONSHIPS THROUGH THE EXAMINATION AND EXCHANGE OF IDEAS HAS FUELED A 
PROLIFERATION OF BOOK DISCUSSION GROUPS ACROSS LOS ANGELES, PARTICULARLY ON THE 
WESTSIDE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ADRIAN MAHER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On a recent evening, six ambitious, hard-working women put their jobs, kids 
and significant others aside to gather in a Santa Monica apartment for a 
discussion on life in the 19th Century. 
</P>
<P>
 Over Brie, fruit and biscuits, the group dissected Jane Austen's first novel, 
"Sense and Sensibility," in a freewheeling discussion that touched on her 
writing style, choice of themes, story structure and the novel's characters -- 
with a group member at one point laying into a protagonist: "Willoughby's a 
scoundrel!" 
</P>
<P>
 "The one thing I've really missed about college has been engaging in 
intellectual conversation and discussions," said group member Jody Kelley, 39, 
a law librarian. "You really get to know each other well through studying books 
-- of who takes sides with what character and who gets morally outraged over 
what themes." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Donna Edmiston, a 34-year-old Los Angeles assistant city attorney and 
club participant: "You become so close because you're discussing really deep 
issues like incest, racial themes, relationships -- things you might not 
discuss with friends at a dinner." 
</P>
<P>
 The gathering is just one of a number of reading groups that in the past few 
years have proliferated all over Los Angeles, particularly on the Westside. 
</P>
<P>
 With an assortment of book lovers, working professionals, retirees and, 
sometimes, lonely hearts, the groups usually meet monthly to discuss a wide 
variety of works, from nonfiction biographies to 19th-Century romantic novels. 
</P>
<P>
 There are no formal statistics on the number of book discussion groups 
throughout the country. But Rachel Jacobsohn, founder of the Illinois-based 
Assn. of Book Group Readers and Leaders, which links reading groups across the 
country, estimated that there are more than 250,000 such clubs in the nation -- 
roughly double the number that existed five years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Jacobsohn based her assessment on talks with academics, pollsters, bookstore 
associations and the accumulation of years of data on clubs throughout the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
 Many experts believe such discussion groups, which tend to attract women more 
than men, are part of a larger movement to satisfy the desire for more 
meaningful social relationships through the examination of ideas and exchange 
of banter in informal gatherings. Discussion groups focusing on topics of the 
day -- the Utne Reader magazine salon groups, for instance -- and church 
reading clubs also have been mushrooming across the country. 
</P>
<P>
 "As a culture, we are receiving deeper spiritual insights from poets and 
novelists rather than from the clergy," said Robert Wuthnow, a professor of 
sociology at Princeton University and author of "Sharing the Journey -- Support 
Groups and America's New Quest for Community." 
</P>
<P>
 Some observers say people seek book discussions to counter workaholic 
lifestyles and the shallow discourse found on talk shows such as "Oprah" and on 
sitcom series. 
</P>
<P>
 "Though book clubs have existed for the last 20 years, the phenomenon is 
really growing," said Linda Friedman, co-owner of Chevalier Books in Hancock 
Park. "People have a real thirst to discuss real things, to bounce ideas off 
other intelligent people. It's an oasis, to be able to sit down and discuss 
some serious literature." 
</P>
<P>
 Some independent bookstores, to which reading groups gravitate because of 
their community ties and often specialized offerings, say the trend has 
increased business. Doug Dutton, owner of Dutton's Brentwood Books estimated 
that book groups account for 15% of his store's sales. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a true grass-roots phenomenon," said Dutton. "We deal with about 40 
book groups a month and I must have two people a day come into the store and 
ask how to get into a reading group." 
</P>
<P>
 Publishers have noted the trend. 
</P>
<P>
 Companies such as Doubleday are targeting reading groups by distributing free 
companion guides for literary works that give author profiles and historical 
backgrounds and offer lists of discussion questions. Best-selling writers such 
as Sue Miller, author of the novel "For Love," have gone on nationwide tours to 
the homes of book club hosts. 
</P>
<P>
 Two guidebooks, the "Group Book Group" by Ellen Slezak and the "Reading Group 
Handbook" by Jacobsohn, were recently published and outline the intricacies of 
creating successful reading groups. A national newsletter, Ex Libris, based in 
Newton, Mass. and a magazine, Book Lovers, published out of Milwaukee, Wis., 
which both inform the growing clubs, are mailed to discussion groups bimonthly. 
And reading groups are hiring book club "facilitators" for literary guidance 
and to provide in-house seminars on the most popular books of other clubs. 
</P>
<P>
 Judith Palarz, a book club facilitator who works out of her Brentwood home, 
says a majority of Westside reading groups prefer a gamut of literature. Her 
suggested reading lists include "something old, something new, something 
ethnic, something true." 
</P>
<P>
 She has noticed most groups are composed of women, with fiction usually more 
popular than nonfiction. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the reason is that men, even in this Iron John age, are not willing 
to discuss their feelings," she said. "In these groups, you get very personal 
with what a book means to you, and you have to build up a lot of trust with the 
other members." 
</P>
<P>
 Slezak says women's predominance in book clubs hearkens back to the old 
university art clubs in the early part of the century, where professors' 
spouses gathered to discuss literature, dance, art and architecture. 
</P>
<P>
 A modern version of that legacy is typified by Edmiston and Kelley's Westside 
reading group, which was started by attorneys Amy Pucker, a Woodland Hills 
resident, and Santa Monica resident Rachelle Bin in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 The 12 women in the club insist they have no feminist or political ax to 
grind. The focus remains on superior literature, ranging from contemporary 
nonfiction to romantic classics. 
</P>
<P>
 The group has read more than two dozen books including "This Boy's Life" by 
Tobias Wolf, "Temple of My Familiar" by Alice Walker and "Geek Love" by Kathryn 
Dunn. 
</P>
<P>
 The members strive to read one book a month, and, to save money, often choose 
a title after a work comes out in paperback. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the women say their spouses have expressed an interest in joining, but 
for now the group remains a women's-only group, by choice. A group member, 
Yvette Sally, said one husband wanted in so badly that, perhaps partly in jest, 
he showed up at a meeting in drag only to be unceremoniously booted. 
</P>
<P>
 "Men would definitely change the dynamics," Pucker said. 
</P>
<P>
 Though many book clubs create their own informal rules, Dianne Leslie, book 
group coordinator for Dutton's Brentwood Books, recommends some crucial 
ingredients. 
</P>
<P>
 Book choices should have complex and arguable themes and plots, unlike 
mass-market page-turners and action thrillers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Get books for the living room, not the bedroom," Leslie said. 
</P>
<P>
 Members should be good listeners, tolerant and analytical. Participants must 
be willing to discuss their own experiences and remain interested in others. 
</P>
<P>
 And, above all, members should read their books on a timely basis. 
</P>
<P>
 "I once had a couple of men come to a group without reading the book and they 
kept offering their opinions," said Leslie. "They should have stayed up all 
night, if that's what it took to finish. You have to for the benefit of the 
group." 
</P>
<P>
 Some observers say the most explosive and interesting discussions occur when 
readers come from a wide variety of backgrounds. Although many groups try to 
reach out and link up with readers of diverse backgrounds, it can be difficult 
to do so. 
</P>
<P>
 "We would very much like to have a different racial mix, to find black and 
Latino couples, but none of us know anyone to bring them in," said Isabel 
Kibel, a Brentwood resident who started a Westside couples reading group eight 
years ago. "We're stuck in the same socioeconomic place -- we're very 
homogenous. But we are still looking." 
</P>
<P>
 Though the lack of heterogeneity may seem confining to some, most agree that 
participating in a book discussion can be liberating. 
</P>
<P>
 Jenny Ladefoged, a 62-year-old Hollywood Hills resident, started a church 
reading group about two years ago. The clique of 14 women of Saint Michael's 
and All Angels Episcopal Church in Studio City read six books a year and range 
in age from 20 to 62. About half of the books involve religious themes. 
</P>
<P>
 "We . . . go deeper into religious themes," Ladefoged said. "We can talk about 
God (among members), which you don't usually do in church, and can put out 
ideas that would be scary in other places." 
</P>
<P>
 Others view book groups as the most viable means of escaping the crushing 
anonymity of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are just so many people in L.A. who have no other way of meeting 
people," said Tony Kiewel, an events planner for Barnes & Noble in Marina del 
Rey. "Some are getting sick of being in hiding. These groups bring people 
together from the area that (they) would never have met previously and provide 
an exposure to books they would never have thought of reading." 
</P>
<P>
 Book club facilitator Palarz has an even more ambitious outlook. She remains 
convinced such discussion groups can bridge the gap between communities in Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be an idealistic way to bring together a mixture of economic groups 
and cultures through the discussions of books," said Palarz. She plans to 
approach the city library system about forming reading groups at each branch 
that would in turn visit other areas of the city for discussions. "It would be 
an attempt to find things in common, to weave people closer and define their 
commonalities through literature." 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever social benefits there may be, many club participants simply enjoy the 
diversion. 
</P>
<P>
 After a 10-hour day of prosecuting such crimes as assault, child molestation, 
stalking and elderly abuse, attorney Edmiston usually returns home feeling like 
a zombie. 
</P>
<P>
 But instead of zoning out in front of the TV, Edmiston employs a more 
effective means of mental relief. 
</P>
<P>
 "Being a member in the group gives me an incentive to read, and provides an 
escape from the harsh realities that I see every day," she said. "As a trial 
lawyer, I'm very focused, logical and pragmatic. By reading great literature, I 
also get to use the left, creative, fantasy side of my brain." READING LIST

FOR SENIORS; NEW ZEALAND NATIVE FINDS HER PLACE AS NANNY IN PALATIAL PALISADES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LINDA FELDMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When she returned to her native New Zealand from America with two babies and 
one U.S. cent in her pocket, Eunice Scott knew she would be all right. 
Abandoned by her husband, she knew she had to be. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, almost 20 years later, when she climbs the several dozen steps to the 
palatial Pacific Palisades villa where she lives, she looks out on her beloved 
ocean, thinks about her life and says, "Now it's my turn." 
</P>
<P>
 There's an apartment in New York, a condo in Santa Fe and she's going to 
celebrate her 60th birthday in New Orleans. Why isn't she writing a how-to book 
on her secrets to living the good life? Because her methods are nothing new -- 
hard work, sacrifice and pain. 
</P>
<P>
 Eunice Scott is a live-in nanny. 
</P>
<P>
 She doesn't own any of these luxurious residences, but she nevertheless lives 
the life that goes with them, caring for a little girl named Melanie whom she 
considers like her own. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Her relationship with Melanie started from the very beginning: Scott was in 
the delivery room when Melanie was born four years ago. But, before her 
relocation to California, she was hired through an agency in Oklahoma and 
decided that nanny school might give her a financial foundation. "I was in 
Oklahoma taking care of elderly people and children but the life was so 
insecure and I was barely making it financially so I decided to go to nanny 
school," Scott said. "With that certificate I could make more money." 
</P>
<P>
 She said that at the time of her decision she was working 40 hours a week 
looking after a small child, making $800 a month with a $2,000-deductible 
health insurance plan. 
</P>
<P>
 To make sure she met the mortgage payments on her house, Scott wiped tables at 
a McDonald's on the weekends and was grateful for the hamburgers they gave her. 
She also baked and sold cookies and baby-sat another child at night. 
</P>
<P>
 She scraped together $1,000 for nanny school and for the next six months 
studied child and parent psychology, body language, child development and 
health. 
</P>
<P>
 Upon completing her studies, she filled out a job request form stating what 
she was prepared to do, what she expected in return, and what she didn't want 
to be around: drugs, alcoholism, filthy language, constant arguing or loud 
music, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was taking care of this little girl who switched on the television in every 
room she walked through. There were four or five sets all on at the same 
(time), each on a different station. She needed noise. I would follow her and 
turn them off," Scott recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 But Scott wasn't always taking care of other people's children. It's only half 
her story. 
</P>
<P>
 Her first trip to the United States was in 1954. She was newly married and 
settled in San Francisco with her husband, who left her three years later when 
she was pregnant with their second child. 
</P>
<P>
 "I went back to New Zealand feeling inferior and thinking, 'Who would want 
me?' So I married again for the wrong reasons. I always felt ashamed of who I 
was with and so I dragged myself down even further," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Her second husband wanted a son, she said, so she agreed to try to have one. 
She did. In exchange, he took care of her and her two other children. But she 
subsequently also had a daughter. When the marriage fell apart, she knew she 
could not take their son, and could not bear the thought of separating the two 
siblings. 
</P>
<P>
 "After 14 years I escaped to save my sanity, leaving behind the two children 
we had together. He wanted a son and I gave him one, but I had a daughter, too, 
and when it came time to leave I couldn't take one and leave the other," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 She never saw them again. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 She decided to go to Oklahoma, where she had already sent her two oldest 
children from the previous marriage to college. "I chose Oklahoma because I 
didn't know any better. It was the Bible Belt and I thought it would be safer." 
</P>
<P>
 When she was hired in California, she rented her Oklahoma house and moved to 
the Palisades. 
</P>
<P>
 For the last four years Scott has taken care of Melanie, a beautiful little 
girl who lives in an environment where her every need is satisfied. Her room is 
filled with stuffed animals, pretty furniture, and a view of the Pacific Ocean 
from her window. She shares this floor of the house with Scott. 
</P>
<P>
 When she talks about Melanie, a face that rarely smiles lights up. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really beautiful that I have this child I can give everything that I 
couldn't give my children without worrying about money," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 It's almost as if Eunice Scott took the hand she was dealt, reshuffled the 
deck and traded in some of her cards for a better play. She didn't change her 
life, she simply re-created it without the hardships she suffered. Her children 
are all adults now -- each with secure futures. Scott says she's saving her 
money, taking care of herself and finally getting some joy from it all. 
</P>
<P>
 And as a New Zealander, Scott has a special relationship with the sea and 
recently took up kayaking with the Southern California Boat Club in Marina del 
Rey. "Anybody can do it," Scott said. "You don't need a lot of strength and 
it's great for your waist. Besides, I would love to have some people in my age 
group to do it with -- not to be serious, just to have fun, to laugh."

THEY LEFT THE LIGHT ON; DURING SUMMER IN THIS REMOTE ALASKAN FRONTIER TOWN, THE 
FISHING'S GREAT AND THE DAYS NEVER SEEM TO END 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 My problem in Homer wasn't the jaywalking moose or the cult of the halibut or 
the spit rats. It wasn't the lady who accused me of being Tom Bodett. All these 
things I came to understand as facets of life in what may be the most 
celebrated small town on America's last frontier. My problem was the summer 
light. I felt obliged to keep exploring as long as it shone, and it just kept 
on shining. 
</P>
<P>
 This was late July, and every day, dawn would arrive around 5, casting a gray 
glow onto the smooth stones, bleached driftwood and silvery tides at Bishop's 
Beach, a block from my bed at the Driftwood Inn. Then the sun would inch its 
way across the sky, the wind would snap and ease, and the 4,200 rumpled and 
sweater-wrapped residents of Homer would go about their busy summer lives: 
hauling in hundred-pound halibut, throwing pots, steering seaplanes over 
glaciers, tidying their bed and breakfasts, piloting ferries across Kachemak 
Bay to Halibut Cove or the old Eskimo and Russian settlement at Seldovia. On 
their way, they'd pass messages to each other via the five-times-daily "bush 
line" of the public radio station, KBBI-AM 890. 
</P>
<P>
 To Natasha: Bears are on the trail between the head of the bay and town. Take 
the low road. From Boris.  
</P>
<P>
 To Bethany: Reminder that you have an appointment Tuesday at Dr. Todd's 
office.  
</P>
<P>
 Ten hours would go by this way, then 15, giving me plenty of time to hit the 
usual tourist highlights. But then I'd find myself passing time, happy but 
unfocused, at just about anything. Combing the shoreline in search of a 
perfectly round stone. Hiking randomly amid the green shrubs and purple flowers 
atop Ohlson Mountain, which overlooks town. Taking a census of boat names in 
the Homer Small Boat Harbor. Watching the dock dogs snap for fish scraps. 
</P>
<P>
 One morning -- or maybe it was afternoon -- I was back at Bishop's Beach 
looking at driftwood and stones, and found Mandy Ewald, 13, Sarah Ewald, 14, 
Tara Guhn, 16, and Crystal Loop, 12, splashing in the chilly surf. But for them 
and me and a few distant specks about a mile along the shore, the beach was 
empty. Beyond the bay, peeking through swirling clouds, lay jagged peaks, 
monumental fiords, Kachemak Glacier, Dinglestadt Glacier, Dixon, Portlock, 
Grewingk, Wosnesenski and Doroshin glaciers. The girls had come by car from 
Fort Wayne, Ind., and this, they agreed, teeth chattering, was the best place 
yet -- even better, they said, than the big mall in Edmonton, Alberta. 
</P>
<P>
 Late that night -- or maybe it was early the next morning -- I sat hunched in 
the din of the Salty Dawg (founded 1957, open until 4 a.m.), my shoes scraping 
in sawdust, my head surrounded by wall-mounted life preservers, my ears ringing 
with beer-fueled accounts of the day's fishing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Today was a big day," charter deckhand Dan Prisaznuk told me. "A friend of 
mine, the first fish on his boat was a 208." 
</P>
<P>
 That would be 208 pounds. The crew needed three shots to kill it. Large 
halibut are often subdued aboard ship by gun shots, lest their twitching tails 
break someone's legs. 
</P>
<P>
 Someone else had a story about another guy, a few days before, who didn't 
bother to spend the $5 it takes to enter the Homer Jackpot Halibut Derby, then 
went out and caught a 300-pound fish. His fish was the biggest of the summer so 
far, which means the $5 the fellow saved might end up costing him a jackpot of 
something like $18,000. Hate it when that happens. 
</P>
<P>
 In this way I floated through the days and nights. Finally, each day, after 18 
or so hours of light, around 11 p.m., the last direct rays of the sun would 
throw a warm pink glow onto the line of ragged peaks across the bay. Anglers 
would still be slouching around the Fishing Hole, and pre-teen kids were out 
riding bikes along the shoulder of East End Road, still sun-drunk. 
</P>
<P>
 Then would come a few hours of twilight, with the moon gleaming over the 
mountains and the still waters of the bay glowing like a great pane of glass, 
gas-jet blue. Then, around 2 a.m., a blink of darkness, under cover of which a 
high-living crew member could crawl home, change clothes, grab a bite and a 
quick nap, and head back out on another charter. Which could account for the 
bumper sticker I saw in the harbor lot: 
</P>
<P>
 "Have you flogged your crew today?" 
</P>
<P>
 Homer, which lies on the Kenai Peninsula about 2,200 miles north of Los 
Angeles, is southern by Alaskan standards. As the eagle flies, it sits about 
100 miles south of Anchorage, and more than 500 miles south of Fairbanks. 
Though the mountains along the horizon never lose their snow, and the 
3-million-year-old Harding Icefield behind them never melts, Homer's location 
on the waters of Kachemak Bay keeps its temperatures moderate: around 60 
degrees in summer, around 20 in winter, with regular runs of rain, clouds and 
wind to keep things interesting. (On my last day in town, the winds were so 
interesting that my "flight-seeing" expedition, to see glaciers and such by 
seaplane, was canceled.) 
</P>
<P>
 Moose roam freely. Bears across the bay swat at salmon in the cold river 
runoff. Whales, otters, puffins and scores of other birds live off the sea and 
shoreline, often within the protected territory of Kachemak Bay State Park. The 
halibut and salmon fisheries draw anglers by the thousands and sustain more 
than a dozen charter companies, which usually charge summer rates around $150 
per person a day. 
</P>
<P>
 In winter, eagles gather here in startling numbers, perching outside the 
flower-festooned trailer-residence of a woman named Jean Keene, who has been 
feeding them for years. Mary Rollins, a Homer resident for most of the last 11 
years, tells the story of a Christmas Eve a few years ago when she and a 
companion drove out on the Spit and counted 159 eagles. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then, four days later," Rollins adds, "we counted 254. Well, we quit at 254." 
</P>
<P>
 (I saw no eagles, though other folks did report sightings during my July 
visit. I did encounter my first moose about 20 minutes after arrival, at an 
intersection one block from the airport. She yielded right of way and bounded 
into the woods.) 
</P>
<P>
 This raw landscape brings in plenty of visitors, nearly all in summer. Some of 
them take a look around at the rich, unfinished nature of the place, decide 
this is where the next chapter of their lives should begin and cease to be 
visitors. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to die here," John Redman told me one afternoon or evening. Redman, 
71 years old and bent from arthritis, moved up from the Lower 48 four years 
ago, gave up his hair-cutting business and started sharpening knives for 
charter companies on the Spit. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like the cold," he explained. Besides, he said, in his new business he has 
"no overhead, and no dirty necks to contend with." 
</P>
<P>
 More often, of course, strangers spend a few days in Homer on the way to 
someplace else. About 115,000 tourists pass through Homer yearly, which puts 
tourism second only to fishing among local industries. (Sometimes, the two 
industries overlap more than folks here would like: The National Car Rental 
outlet levies $100 fines against customers who bring back cars with interiors 
reeking of fish.) 
</P>
<P>
 But there's a whiff of culture in Homer's air too, and here and there the 
twinkle of New Age crystals. More than a dozen galleries fill their shelves and 
walls with the work of resident artists and craft workers. The Smoky Bay Co-op 
stocks mango chutney and various organic wares for a large and devoted 
clientele. In October, 1989, voters declared the city a nuclear-free zone. 
</P>
<P>
 Just across Kachemak Bay lies Halibut Cove, an artists' community of about 160 
residents (40 in winter). Halibut Cove is reachable only by ferry, but 
nevertheless pulls in dozens of travelers daily, most of whom leave the Homer 
harbor at noon and return at 5 p.m. (adult round-trip fare: $35). Crossing the 
bay, passengers get a close-up view of the murre, puffin and other birds on 
Gull Island, then watch as the ferry pulls into a charming inlet with houses on 
pilings connected by a winding boardwalk. 
</P>
<P>
 On my day trip there, I admired the locally produced pottery, jewelry and 
sepia-toned octopus-ink paintings, and ate a spectacular lunch of Halibut 
Veracruz, beans, rice and fresh bread at the Saltry restaurant. After the meal, 
I found myself standing on the boardwalk in the middle of a truly strange and 
pleasant scene: Snowy mountains rising above, green lagoon sprawling before me, 
idle boats bobbing here and there, and next to the Experience Art Gallery 
entrance, a freckle-faced 9-year-old named Nicky Riordan, practicing his cello. 
Minuets, mostly. 
</P>
<P>
 He'd been playing for three years, he told me, and he liked playing in summer 
best because he was on vacation from mandatory daily practice. Finally I had to 
go back to catch the ferry back to Homer, but all the way down the boardwalk, I 
could hear Nicky's bow strokes echoing across the inlet. 
</P>
<P>
 For such a small place, Homer looms large in popular culture. Or at least 
facsimiles of it do. Cicely, a tiny, quirky and fictional Alaskan town not 
entirely unlike Homer, has been the setting of the television series "Northern 
Exposure" for more than four years. And there are the folksy books and Motel 6 
radio commericals ("We'll leave the light on for ya") of Tom Bodett, a 
Michigan-bred, 12-year resident of Homer who has set many of his fictional 
stories in a tiny Alaskan community he calls "The End of the Road." 
</P>
<P>
 Before I left for Homer, I called Bodett and solicited, from the voice that 
promises to leave the light on for you, a quick insider's take on his town. 
</P>
<P>
 Homer is like most small towns, Bodett said, in that "people know each other's 
business, and people tend to care about each other a little more because they 
know each other a little better than they do in bigger cities." But he also 
pointed out a compound distinction that does make Homer different: "The people 
who settled this land are still around," but now they've been joined by 
well-educated, simplicity-seeking immigrants from the Lower 48. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are more unused college degrees in Homer," said Bodett, "than I've seen 
anywhere." 
</P>
<P>
 Homer's tourism and fishing industries both begin with a geographical oddity 
called the Spit, which reaches 4.5 miles into the waters of Kachemak Bay. From 
the lookout point by the satellite dishes on Skyline Drive, the Spit looks like 
a long finger of sand. To a walker on its millions of tide-worn rocks, it can 
sound as brittle as glass breaking underfoot. Some stretches of the Spit sunk 
six feet into the bay in Alaska's 1964 Good Friday earthquake, but by then the 
local economy was built around it, and it continues to be the busiest place in 
town. It houses five boardwalks bristling with fishing charter services, tacky 
souvenir stands and seafood restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearby lie scores of RV camping spots, the Salty Dawg bar, a hotel called the 
Land's End Resort, Jean Keene's trailer and, in summer, hundreds of tent 
campsites along the beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the tent pilgrims, who also call themselves "spit rats," arrive with 
the warm weather after Memorial Day, and many take jobs with charter companies. 
Eager to underline the Spit's informal status as End of the Road, they tack up 
mileage signs announcing distances -- to Paris, to Riverside, to Oconomowoc 
(Wisconsin) -- and give their settlements names like Freedom Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had a little money saved up, so I figured, 'Ah, well, I'll go down to Homer 
and live like a bum all summer,' " said Scott Wales, a 32-year-old spit rat, 
erstwhile waiter from Scottsdale, Ariz., and apparent mayor of Freedom Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Another night -- I think it was night -- while taking pictures a few hundred 
yards up the shore from Freedom Beach, I met another pair of spit rats as they 
stoked a bonfire, barbecued some fresh cod and sucked Budweisers. One of them, 
who gave the name Smitty and punctuated his sentences with the exclamation 
"Arrrgh," proposed that we steal a Coast Guard ship and pirate our way to 
Hamburg, Germany. He was serious, in a stinking drunk sort of way. 
</P>
<P>
 The rest of town is built on meadows and hillside among sandstone bluffs, 
overgrown by spruce, birch, alder and elderberry, and arranged around the main 
drag of Pioneer Avenue. Pioneer runs a mile through town and, in the 
improvised, spread-out fashion of Alaskan development, sustains enough 
businesses to fill about one-half mile of main drag in the Lower 48. City Hall, 
the library, the Smoky Bay Co-op, and the Ptarmigan Arts and Homer Artists 
galleries are all along Pioneer. 
</P>
<P>
 One afternoon -- or perhaps evening -- I ducked into the Homer Public Library 
and wound up comparing the Homer News' police reports with those of its upstart 
rival, the Homer Tribune. The News scored a clear scoop, and offered a strong 
clue to the volume and depth of crime in the city, with its account of the 
escaped goat discovered "eating flowers and harassing customers" at the Wolf 
Sculpture Gallery. The goat's owner got off with a warning. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pratt Museum, just off Pioneer Avenue, traces the region's natural 
history, admirably paying particular attention to recent events. Downstairs, at 
a standing exhibit called "Darkened Waters: Profile of an Oil Spill," visitors 
press a button and hear the low, laconic voice of Capt. Joseph Hazelwood, 
calling a Coast Guard dispatcher on March 24, 1989, to report a problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, Valdez back, we should be on your radar there. We've fetched up, hard 
aground, north of Goose Island, off Bligh Reef, and evidently leaking some oil, 
and we're gonna be here for a while, and, if you want . . . so, you're 
notified." 
</P>
<P>
 The spill amounted to more than 10.8 million gallons of crude oil dumped into 
Prince William Sound, the largest spill in United States history. Exxon agreed 
in 1991 to a $900 million civil settlement payment to state and federal 
officials, but several other spill-related lawsuits are still in progress. 
Though no traces of oil are visible on Homer's beaches five years later, the 
city's shores were among the 1,500 miles of directly affected Alaskan 
coastline. Cathy Godfrey, who moved to Homer just in time to experience the 
spill, remembers sitting at the Land's End restaurant, a plate of clams before 
her, while beyond the window on the beach, clean-up workers strolled the beach 
in contamination suits. 
</P>
<P>
 For all the natural wonders that surround it, urban Homer is not a postcard 
place. Mark Turner, who arrived from Tucson four years ago and serves as editor 
and publisher of the Homer News, says he loves the place and has no plans to 
leave it, but he describes much of the local architecture as the "Ugly Alaska" 
school of design -- buildings raised of necessity from resources at hand, and 
neighbored by stray materials that might someday come in handy. Junked old 
cars, for instance, and odd pieces of lumber. 
</P>
<P>
 This may scare off aesthetes, but it's a direct expression of how recently and 
roughly the town rose from the dirt and weeds. Non-native settlers, who came to 
exploit coal and other mineral deposits, didn't try to establish any kind of 
community here until the end of the 19th Century, and then they failed. (One of 
them was a gold prospector from New York named Homer Pennock, who gave his name 
to the place before he gave up.) After close to 20 years of deterioration, the 
town was rebuilt in the 1920s, '30s and '40s by fishermen and homesteaders who 
arrived and departed by boat and plane. Homer's future was assured in 1950, 
when a state crew completed Sterling Highway, the first road connection to 
Anchorage and the outside world. Locals say that by then, Homer's 
salt-of-the-earth, head-in-the-stars, end-of-the-road character was probably 
already set. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I grew up," says artist Asia Freeman, who was raised here in the 1960s, 
"it was the fundamentalists and the anarchists." (Some of the city folks up in 
Anchorage apparently have another word for those who live here: Homeroid.) 
</P>
<P>
 These days, Freeman and her partner, carpenter Kurt Marquardt, are trying to 
put their own stamp on the new Homer. The focus of their efforts is a boxy old 
building at Main Street and Bunnell. Fifty-seven years ago, the building was 
put up to hold a boarding house upstairs and a general mercantile store below. 
</P>
<P>
 Now it houses the Bunnell Street Gallery (founded 1991) downstairs, the Old 
Inlet Trading Post B&B (founded 1993) upstairs, the Two Sisters Espresso Bakery 
(founded in 1993) next door, and boatwright Gregor Welpton's shop next door. A 
vintage clothing shop, about a year old, stands brightly hued across the 
street, and an informal guild of home beer brewers meets in the basement. It 
feels like a place where things are going to happen. 
</P>
<P>
 It was about three blocks from there, however, that the Tom Bodett thing 
happened. I was eating a late dinner alone near the rear of Cafe Cups on 
Pioneer Avenue, and an assertive woman from out of town was leading her party 
of seven into a discussion of Homer's leading author and radio host. 
</P>
<P>
 First she asked the waitress where Bodett was. Getting no satisfactory answer, 
she pivoted in her seat, spied me in the back, and announced to her friends, to 
me, and to the rest of the restaurant, "I'll bet that's him. Are you Tom 
Bodett?" 
</P>
<P>
 The real Tom Bodett, I knew, was on vacation in Hawaii. This was one of those 
wondrous Alaskan opportunities, my chance to adopt a drawl, say whatever I 
pleased, and add a Tom Bodett chapter to my life. 
</P>
<P>
 Alas, Mr. Bodett can rest easy. I just shook my head, finished off my 
scallops, and stepped out of the restaurant into the late-night lazy afternoon 
light of summertime Homer. A true Homerite, I suspect, might have done 
otherwise. GUIDEBOOK: Homer Primer

TRAVEL INSIDER: MINOR'S DEATH RAISES ISSUES OF DRINKING ON CRUISE SHIPS; LAW: 
THE AGE LIMIT DROPS TO 18 AT SEA. A SPOKESMAN REMINDS PARENTS THAT A CRUISE IS 
A RESORT VACATION, NOT BABY-SITTING.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Early on the morning of Friday, July 22, the Royal Caribbean Cruise Line's 
ship Majesty of the Seas made its way from Jamaica to the Bahamas, sailing as 
usual under Norwegian registry. On an upper deck, a small group of young people 
gathered and got to drinking. One of those young people was Hayman Ronald 
Lucas, a 14-year-old boy from Elmont, N.Y., whose father and stepmother were 
apparently asleep in their cabin. 
</P>
<P>
 Hayman was a big boy -- 5-foot-4 and 195 pounds -- but he drank a lot more 
tequila and rum than his body could handle. Over the course of the early 
morning hours, authorities say, he pushed his blood-alcohol level to at least 
0.29, more than three times the California legal threshold for intoxication, 
and apparently drank himself to death. An investigation found that the alcohol 
the boy drank was supplied by a 24-year-old ship passenger who acquired it 
ashore during a previous port call. 
</P>
<P>
 Whose fault is the death? Whose law applies? And as an isolated occurrence in 
a generally placid corner of the travel industry, should this incident send any 
particular message to the traveling public? 
</P>
<P>
 The first two questions may never be sorted out to the satisfaction of all 
concerned. But many authorities agree that among travelers and cruise lines, 
the interaction of young people, alcohol and ships merits close attention. 
</P>
<P>
 Most notably, many travelers may not realize that although the minimum legal 
drinking age in all 50 states is 21, the rules of most cruise lines, including 
Royal Caribbean, allow 18-year-olds to order alcohol once their ships are in 
international waters. 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond that, cruise officials and others say, adult passengers need to 
remember that while they may be leaving American laws and their workaday lives 
behind, they're placing themselves under new laws and retaining plenty of 
responsibilities, including the welfare of children. 
</P>
<P>
 "The best advice that you can give," said Jim Lida, manager of corporate 
communications for Royal Caribbean Cruise Line, "is that a cruise is a resort 
vacation. It's not a baby-sitting service." 
</P>
<P>
 Cruise industry officials say they don't see any missteps on the part of Royal 
Caribbean. But they do acknowledge that the ship staffs need to be sure that 
their enforcement of shipboard rules keeps up with their marketing efforts to 
bring younger cruisers and more families aboard. 
</P>
<P>
 "This incident has made a lot of cruise lines take a close look at their 
policies regarding alcohol and minors," said Julie Benson, spokeswoman for Los 
Angeles-based Princess Cruises. 
</P>
<P>
 From the Florida State Attorney's office come the following details from the 
probe of last month's death: The group of drinkers, which apparently included 
half a dozen teens under 18, one 18-year-old and the 24-year-old who supplied 
some or all of the alcohol, was apparently gathered on an upper pool deck from 
roughly 3 a.m. to 5 a.m. A crew member found the boy staggering on deck at 
about 5 a.m., and escorted him to his family's cabin, and his father and 
stepmother were awakened. It was several hours later, about 11 a.m., that the 
boy's stepmother called the ship's medical office and reported that the boy had 
stopped breathing. 
</P>
<P>
 After doctors' resuscitation efforts failed, the boy was pronounced dead at 
12:05 p.m. Preliminary reports named alcohol poisoning as cause of death; at 
press time, the Dade County Medical Examiner's Office was still awaiting 
results of toxicology tests. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on that information, "I would find it very difficult to hold the cruise 
line responsible," said Ed Perkins, editor of the Consumer Reports Travel 
Letter. "Are you going to sue a city park because some 24-year-old buys booze 
and feeds it to a 14-year-old?" 
</P>
<P>
 In the immediate aftermath of the death, many accounts noted that because the 
Majesty of the Seas was in international waters, there was essentially no 
minimum legal drinking age aboard the ship. Not so, say several authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 After a preliminary investigation by officers from the Miami-based Metro Dade 
Homicide unit, officials from the Florida State Attorney's office said they 
could claim jurisdiction because a majority of the ship's passengers embarked 
in Miami. Michael R. Band, chief assistant state attorney in that office, said 
last week that a decision had not been made about whether to file criminal 
charges in the incident. 
</P>
<P>
 But jurisdiction questions can be murky. Attorney Larry Kaye, whose firm, 
Kaye, Rose, Tamulski & Maltzman, has represented more than a dozen cruise lines 
(including Royal Caribbean) points out that travelers on ships in international 
waters (more than three miles from land, generally) are often considered 
subject to the laws in the ships' nation of registry. Cruising on a 
foreign-flagged ship, Kaye said, can be "basically no different than entering a 
foreign country." 
</P>
<P>
 For various business reasons, including tax rates and crewing requirements, 
most cruise ships serving American passengers are registered in Liberia, Italy, 
Greece, Norway, Great Britain, Holland, the Bahamas or Panama. But Kaye said he 
has never encountered a nation of registry with a minimum drinking age of less 
than 18. 
</P>
<P>
 The daunting problem for a cruise line, Kaye said, is that if there's a minor 
drinking, "how do you become aware of it, especially if it's late at night, or 
it's being concealed, or it's in a cabin, or it's alcohol that was obtained 
ashore?" 
</P>
<P>
 When docked, cruise ships follow liquor laws of local jurisdictions. Here's a 
sampling of policies at sea: 
</P>
<P>
 * Policy on Royal Caribbean ships, as on most lines, is to issue every 
passenger a boarding card. Most passengers have one hole punched in their cards 
to indicate that they have accounts open to pay for shipboard purchases. The 
boarding cards of passengers under 18, spokesman Lida said, are punched with 
three holes, to indicate that the bearer shouldn't be served alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
 * On the nine ships of Princess Cruise Line, passengers under 18 have the 
letter "M" imprinted on their boarding cards. In "questionable" cases a 
spokeswoman said, servers can ask for photo identification. 
</P>
<P>
 * At Norwegian Cruise Line, which operates six ships, spokeswoman Fran Sevcik 
said crews in international waters will sell beer and wine to passengers age 18 
or older, but hard liquor only to passengers 21 or older. Servers rely on photo 
identification, not boarding cards, to confirm passengers' ages, Sevcik said. 
</P>
<P>
 * On the three ships of Royal Cruise Line, the drinking age at sea is 18 for 
beer and wine, 21 for more potent drinks. 
</P>
<P>
 * On the two U.S.-based ships of Costa Cruise Lines, a spokeswoman said, 
servers ask for photo identification whenever they're unsure that a passenger 
is over 18. 
</P>
<P>
 * On Carnival Cruise Line's nine ships, servers enforce their minimum age of 
18 by asking for photo identification from passengers whose appearance suggests 
that they may be under age. If a passenger under 18 is caught trying to order a 
drink, a spokeswoman said, servers are instructed to punch a hole in the 
boarding card.

NEWS, TIPS & BARGAINS; AMERICAN FAMILY CRUISES FOLDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 American Family Cruises, the first cruise line to cater exclusively to 
families with children, will cease operations on Sept. 9, not quite nine months 
after launching service. 
</P>
<P>
 The American Adventure, AFC's only ship, will sail as scheduled through Sept. 
3 when it will embark on its final seven-day voyage from Miami. 
</P>
<P>
 After the Sept. 3 cruise, the American Adventure will return to its owner, 
Genoa-based Costa Cruises. The EugenioCosta, originally slated to become AFC's 
second ship, the American Pioneer, will remain in the Costa fleet. 
</P>
<P>
 Travelers holding reservations on either ship for the Sept. 10 sailings and 
beyond are being offered several options, including a full refund, a 
spokeswoman said. They may also take an American Adventure cruise on Aug. 13, 
20, 27 or Sept. 3 or they may transfer their AFC booking to either a Costa 
Romantica seven-day Caribbean cruise or a Holland American Caribbean cruise. 
</P>
<P>
 The American Adventure began sailing on seven-day cruises to the eastern 
Caribbean on Dec. 18, 1993 and offered an extensive program for children. 
Although the family-cruise idea was greeted with much interest, "the business 
has not been sufficiently strong or consistent to provide the financial results 
necessary to justify a year-round operation," the company said.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Britain and Boston are booming; Jamaica and the Grand Canyon are not, and 
Hawaii tourism appears to be on the rise. 
</P>
<P>
 In Boston, hoteliers are expecting their best summer in eight years -- and 
their busiest August ever -- thanks to the World Cup, several conventions and a 
surge in international travelers. 
</P>
<P>
 Tourists are also flooding Britain, where authorities say they could top 20 
million visitors for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
 However, second-quarter tourist arrivals in Jamaica dropped 8.5% from last 
year, according to figures released in July, and hoteliers blamed a recent 
spate of crimes against visitors. 
</P>
<P>
 And visitation at the Grand Canyon has been down this year -- 7% in May, from 
1993, and 12% in June -- and so far National Park Service warnings about 
mega-crowds have not panned out. Hotel bookings in the area are also down. 
</P>
<P>
 A total of 538,880 visitors went to Hawaii in June, 6.6% more than in June, 
1993. It was the fifth consecutive month of "modest but steady growth" in 
tourism, according to the Hawaii Visitors Bureau.

 Batting around some ideas for a last-minute trip? How about Austin, Tex., for 
the annual migration of thousands of Mexican free-tailed bats. The migration is 
at its peak in August, when the number of bats reaches 1.5 million and they 
have their young and roost under the Congress Avenue Bridge, which spans Town 
Lake.They fly out at dusk in mile-long columns to feast on up to 30,000 pounds 
of insects. See them from a special observation area at the bridge's southeast 
corner, or from the water on a nightly one-hour bat cruise, with guano shields 
($8 per person), or a romantic bat-watching cruise for two ($32 per person, 
with dinner). Information: Bat Conservation International, (512) 327-9721;

WEEKEND ESCAPE: SANTA FE; GRAND OPERATUNITY; A COUPLE IS DRAWN AGAIN TO HEAR 
THE CLEAR BEAUTY OF THE HUMAN VOICE IN THE VAST NEW MEXICO DESERT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 There is no place I'd rather be than in an opera house, and there's no place 
my husband, Bill, would rather be than on a trail somewhere. So, when it came 
time to pick a place to celebrate anniversary No. 8 in early July, we didn't 
hesitate: Santa Fe, N.M., was our mutual choice. 
</P>
<P>
 We are hardly the first to come to this decision. Last year, 838,855 overnight 
visitors disgorged on the city of 50,000, and this year it was judged the top 
destination in the world by readers of Conde Nast Traveler. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the city's magic lies in its past, which makes itself felt in its 
architecture, Pueblo ruins, and churches and shrines, and which serves to 
soften its darker side: the traffic congestion, crowds and the threatening tide 
of over-development. 
</P>
<P>
 We had been to Santa Fe once before, to celebrate our fifth anniversary, and 
if there was one thing we'd learned, it's that you cannot begin trip planning 
too early. We booked our room at the Grant Corner Inn, a three-story manor 
house built in the early 1900s, on Jan. 6; we ordered opera tickets on Feb. 1, 
the first day they were available to non-subscribers. (Tickets are still 
available for almost all performances.) 
</P>
<P>
 After work on Thursday, we took a 90-minute Southwest flight (crowded but 
cheap, thanks to Southwest's Friends Fly Free fare) to Albuquerque, where we 
picked up a rental car and checked into a motel. We had grand plans for an 
early start on Friday, of driving into the vast sky-bowl of a New Mexico 
morning while the sun was still rising. But . . . there is something about New 
Mexico that makes one want to slow down . . . live in the moment . . . soak up 
the light. So it was closer to mid-morning by the time we hit I-25 for the 
60-mile drive into Santa Fe. 
</P>
<P>
 After picking up picnic supplies that would provide us with at least three 
meals, we were off for an early lunch at El Farol, an old restaurant that is 
housed in an even older adobe at the top of Canyon Road. The place jumps at 
night, but at midday it was deserted. In fact, although the restaurant opens at 
11, the staff was still setting up, so we settled down at a small table on the 
porch to watch the passing parade and to study the menu. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the tapas (small dishes that originated in Spain) on the menu, we chose a 
delicious. Soon the checked tablecloth was covered with tiny plates, bread 
baskets and two of the best -- but pricey -- glasses of sangria we'd ever had. 
</P>
<P>
 Then we headed for the Santa Fe Opera, which is seven miles outside of town on 
U.S. 84/285, perched atop a hill below the Sangre de Cristo Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Fe Opera was begun by John Crosby, an ailing musician and dreamer from 
the East Coast who came west in the mid-'50s in search of a climate more suited 
to his health. He built his opera house in a natural bowl on what had been the 
San Juan Guest Ranch. Before construction began, he hired an acoustician and 
the two paced off the grounds, firing a cap pistol to determine the absolutely 
perfect location. It worked; the sound is fabulous. 
</P>
<P>
 That's just one of the stories we heard on the hour-long backstage tour of the 
opera house that snakes through the costume and wig department, the set and 
prop rooms and the carpentry shop where every stick of furniture must be custom 
made to accommodate Santa Fe's unique staging requirements: The house does not 
have a curtain and there is no room overhead to roll up scenery or backdrops. 
</P>
<P>
 Tours usually include a trip across the stage, but this afternoon a rehearsal 
of "The Abduction From the Seraglio" was in progress and the director had 
called for a closed set. Although we didn't get to see the stage, we did get to 
hear some gorgeous singing and the management shaved $3 off the tour price. 
</P>
<P>
 By mid-afternoon we were ready to find our B&B, which we had selected after 
reading several enthusiastic reviews. Grant Corner Inn is two blocks west of 
the downtown Plaza. To walk through its shaded gazebo is to leave the Southwest 
behind and enter a Victorian world. Our room (No. 10) on the third floor had a 
little nook with a love seat that was great for reading, but next time I'd like 
to sample Rooms 7 or 8, which share a small porch. All 11 rooms -- some quite 
small, others quite spacious -- have Oriental rugs, hardwood floors, brass 
beds, ceiling fans, handmade quilts, small refrigerators and radios. We were 
told that the inn is almost totally sold out through August (and reservations 
for July and August are recommended six months in advance.) 
</P>
<P>
 We climbed the two flights of stairs to our room, where we found fruit and 
chocolate awaiting. With the afternoon breeze gently blowing in the open window 
(we never did turn on the air conditioner, although temperatures were in the 
low '90s throughout the weekend) we were both out like lights. 
</P>
<P>
 That evening, since we were going to the opera, it seemed only fitting to dine 
at Ristorante La Traviata. Our reservations were for 6 p.m., which allowed 
plenty of time before a 9 p.m. curtain. 
</P>
<P>
 As the twilight deepened, we wound our way up the freeway to the opera house, 
although we could have taken a private bus service called Shuttlejack, which 
for $6 per person makes a loop of several hotels, and goes out to the opera. We 
wanted to be there in time to do a little people watching; it's one of the best 
parts of the show. 
</P>
<P>
 We were blessed with clear skies for our "Tosca" and if the performance was 
uneven, the opera house was magnificent. With the lights of Los Alamos 
twinkling on the horizon, and a cool breeze blowing across the audience, 
Puccini's lush music welled up around us and cast its own spell against the 
total hush of the desert. No helicopters flying overhead here. There's 
something about the opera in Santa Fe; maybe it's the festival atmosphere . . . 
the enthusiasm of the company . . . the glory of the music . . . the clear 
beauty of the voice against the vast New Mexico desert. Whatever it is, it's a 
magnet that draws me back again and again. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday morning we were up early because we wanted to be at Bandelier 
National Monument, about 46 miles away, by 8 a.m. The monument, named after 
Adolph Bandelier (who first explored the site in the 1880s), is one of the 
major archeological sites of the Anasazi, thought by many scholars to be the 
ancestors of the Pueblo. It is a rare sanctuary, as much a wilderness today as 
it was a century ago, and totally devoid of neon, snack bars, souvenir stands 
and, if you get there first thing in the morning, most people. 
</P>
<P>
 The ancients lived in caves in the canyon and built houses of masonry from one 
to three stories high against the walls. We clambered up ladders to the upper 
chambers to see where the Anasazi ate, slept and cooked, where they stored 
provisions and where the men anchored weaving frames in the walls and floor. By 
the time we walked out nearly five hours later, the parking lot, which had been 
deserted when we arrived, was wall-to-wall cars. We left as soon as Bill had 
found several treasures in the small but excellent bookstore. 
</P>
<P>
 As sunset neared, we headed for what would be the perfect ending to a perfect 
day: a long hot soak at Ten Thousand Waves, a Japanese spa tucked into a 
mountainside about five miles east of the city limits. 
</P>
<P>
 There are five private tubs, each with redwood decks and mountain views. Each 
has its own name -- our's was the Moon tub -- and its own ambience. There are 
also communal tubs and even a waterfall tub that holds up to 12 people. 
Everything is scrupulously clean. 
</P>
<P>
 We arrived, as instructed, at 7:45 for our 8 p.m. reservation. We were issued 
locker keys and cotton kimonos and directed to separate dressing rooms where we 
were told to stash our clothes, shower lightly and report back. Which we did, 
feeling slightly awkward in our kimonos and rubber flip-flops. However, once we 
slid into the water, everything else ceased to matter. 
</P>
<P>
 The tub was ours for an hour and for the first 15 minutes, we turned the jets 
on full blast. But then we switched off the power and total peace and quiet 
descended. We were mesmerized by the wind, the air, the setting sun. We didn't 
talk much. We'd probably still be there if a disembodied voice hadn't emanated 
from the intercom: "Moon pool, your time is about up."

GEAR & GADGETS: NEW FROM THE OFFICE OF IMPROVED LUGGAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUDI DASH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Frequent business travelers have learned that organization often is the key to 
job efficiency. That goes for traveling gear too. 
</P>
<P>
 Although a garment bag is great for keeping business attire wrinkle-free, most 
are not designed to effectively accommodate all the other clothes and 
accouterments needed on a trip. 
</P>
<P>
 Happily, Samsonite's Ultravalet Garment Bag does double duty as a suit holder 
and regular piece of luggage. Unzipped, the bag opens like a book. Hanging 
items go on one side, while, on the other, four zippered see-through mesh 
pockets of varying sizes are designed to hold folded shirts, sweaters, 
underwear, ties and belts. Corner pockets above the hanging compartment are 
provided for shoes and accessories, such as a hair blower or toiletries kit, 
while a fold-down panel with elastic straps at the bottom of the hanger side of 
the bag keeps longer clothes from wrinkling. The panel also has a zippered 
plastic "wet pack" compartment for keeping damp or soiled items separate from 
dry ones. The tops of both sides of the bag have hooks, so the open bag can be 
hung in a closet or on a door, with all the contents easily accessible. As a 
bonus, the hanger fixture (which holds any hanger), telescopes so you can take 
out one garment without removing others. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of all the pockets, this bag is slightly larger and heavier than many 
other garment bags, but the efficient use of space is worth the extra size, and 
I had no trouble getting the bag in most overhead plane compartments. 
</P>
<P>
 Samsonite Ultravalet Garment Bag lists for $200, but is available for less at 
discount luggage stores. 
</P>

<P>
 Lands' End, a distributor of upscale leisure wear and rugged luggage, has come 
up with the snazziest-looking attache case I've seen. Made of soft cowhide and 
reminiscent of a Pony Express bag, the caramel-colored bag is all business 
inside with two large compartments separated by a rigid divider that has 
pockets for note pads, a large calculator, note pad computer, or slim cellular 
phone, pens and business cards. The front flap opens and closes via 
spring-action snaps or adjustable straps with brass buckles. There's a padded 
handle as well as a detachable carrying strap with a padded shoulder guard. 
</P>
<P>
 While testing this attache on a trip, several people stopped me to ask where 
I'd gotten it -- it's that gorgeous. The leather makes it heavier than the 
nylon carrying bags I'm used to, but I like the classiness of the bag. There's 
loads of room inside for business papers. 
</P>
<P>
 Nubuck Attache (Item No. 2689-2230) is $149 from Lands' End; (800) 356-4444.  
</P>
<P>
 I get some of my best business ideas while driving -- often on long-distance 
hauls. But if I don't write my thoughts down immediately, however, they're 
frequently lost forever, but trying to maneuver a note pad on my lap while 
driving is unwieldy. Recently I found a car clipboard/note pad that attaches to 
the front window or dashboard via a suction cup with a lever release. The 
clipboard comes with a ballpoint pen attached to a coil chord, and there's a 
built-in light powered by one AA battery (not included). 
</P>
<P>
 Light-Up Car Clipboard/Note Pad, and Pen (No. 925190) is $5.98 from Lillian 
Vernon, a mail order company: (800) 285-5555.  
</P>
<P>
 Where's a stapler or scissors when you need one on the go? No problem. An 
ingenious 11-in-1 tool called the Multi Worker is like taking your desk drawer 
along on the trip. In addition to the above items, the diminutive container 
(four inches long and just five ounces) houses a refillable ballpoint pen, a 
knife-edge carton opener, a staple and tack remover, a pen holder, a tiny 
pull-out case for storing extra staples and paper clips and a ring for a belt 
hook. The whole shebang takes up little space in a brief case or purse, and 
mine has come in handy on numerous occasions all over the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Multi Worker (No. KT546) is $16.85 from Magellan's; (800) 962-4943.

CRUISING: NORTH AMERICA; SAILING INTO FALL; MORE CRUISES ARE LINING UP TO 
CAPTURE THE COLORS OF AUTUMN BLAZING CLOSE TO HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JON MARCUS, Marcus is a free-lance writer based in Boston, Mass. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This tiny seaside village seems at anchor in the shadow of the cruise ship, 
rather than the other way around. Even the tender that ferries passengers to 
shore is bigger than the lobster boats tied up along the pier. 
</P>
<P>
 But giant liners like the Cunard Crown Monarch are calling commonly these days 
at picture-postcard ports along the rugged coastline of New England and eastern 
Canada. "We've been to the Caribbean three times," said Ellen McCrories of 
Gaithersburg, Md., as she and her husband strolled the streets of Provincetown 
on a sightseeing shore excursion last fall. "We've been through the (Panama) 
Canal. This is a nice, relaxing cruise that's close to home, but something 
different." 
</P>
<P>
 Regular fall cruises have been offered in the Midwest since the late 1940s, 
with the Delta Queen Steamboat Co. now running two paddle-wheelers along the 
wooded Mississippi and its tributaries. But 10 years ago in New England, only 
three cruise ships sailed the lonely ocean off the coast. In 1994, 10 ships 
will ply the North Atlantic, most during fall foliage season, generally 
considered to be from mid-September to Columbus Day. At least one more ship is 
expected to be added to the lineup next year. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of the charm (of these cruises) is the history," said Ann Burguieres, 
spokeswoman for Regency Cruises, whose 836-passenger Regent Sun sails weekly, 
June to October, between New York and Montreal. "You get a taste of Europe in 
Quebec and Nova Scotia. It's a great diversity of scenic opportunities and 
different types of cultures, yet it's not too far away." 
</P>
<P>
 Cruise lines have been racing recently to be first to call at ports in Maine, 
New Brunswick and Nova Scotia. Last year, Martha's Vineyard, Mass., had a visit 
from Cunard's Crown Dynasty on its maiden voyage. This year, the Seabourn Pride 
added Kennebunkport, Me., to its schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 The ships snake through the narrow Cape Cod Canal, past the pines and rugged 
cliffs of coastal Maine and through the Gulf of St. Lawrence, where blue whales 
breach. They glide along the Saguenay River and stop in French Quebec. Port 
calls include isolated fishing villages in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick and, 
in the U.S., landfalls of the early European colonists. 
</P>
<P>
 Passengers can disembark with relative ease in places like Bar Harbor, Me.; 
Provincetown, Mass., and trendy Newport, R.I., while landlocked tourists in 
cars fume in traffic. Many of the ships' New England destinations are all but 
inaccessible by land or air in summertime and early fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, stops are brief, and scheduled activities ashore occasionally 
superficial. One cruise line promises that passengers will "meet a licensed 
Maine lobsterman" in Bar Harbor, Me., but they probably won't have time to see 
much of Acadia National Park, the area's foremost natural attraction, with a 
quintessential mountains-meet-the-sea terrain. 
</P>
<P>
 Some shore excursions are reasonably priced. Passengers on Crystal Cruises 
meet the Maine lobsterman for free, and on Regency Cruises' Regent Sun, 
passengers can return from Montreal to New York by Amtrak train, through New 
England's inland fall foliage, for an add-on of $95. 
</P>
<P>
 Other side trips are pricier. One high-end example is on the Seabourn Pride; 
when it puts in for a day at St. John's, Newfoundland, passengers can fly by 
helicopter to Miramichi Bay in New Brunswick for a day of salmon fishing. The 
cost for the excursion: $700 per person. 
</P>
<P>
 That's about the entire cost of a three-night, fall foliage cruise aboard the 
Delta Queen or the Mississippi Queen, the paddle-wheelers that operate on the 
Ohio, Arkansas and Mississippi rivers. Both ships hire a naturalist to point 
out the highlights of the autumn scenery. 
</P>
<P>
 The big draw is naturally the foliage, whose peak of color is easy to time, 
given a choice of frequent sailings. The paddle-wheelers depart Cincinnati, St. 
Louis and other heartland cities every three or four days. Timing is inevitably 
more difficult for cruise lines, which schedule their ships two years in 
advance. Also, some North America cruises cover a long, north-to-south stretch 
of coast, so while the leaves might be golden in Canada, by the time the ship 
sails to, say, New York they could still be summer green. 
</P>
<P>
 But, in the words of Jim Godsman, president of the Cruise Lines International 
Assn., "Autumn, when the last crowds of summer vacationers have retreated, is 
quite possibly the best time to take a cruise," regardless of the color of the 
leaves. 
</P>
<P>
 "People can use that cruise as a great way to see those places they might 
later want to go back and visit," in more depth, added Godsman, who said he 
cruised last autumn from Quebec to New York City. 
</P>
<P>
 The major drawback to autumn cruising, then? 
</P>
<P>
 "The weather," grunted Crown Monarch Capt. Lennart Jonsson, as we talked in 
his office aboard the Crown Monarch in Provincetown's harbor. Jonsson was 
navigating through a sea of paperwork on his desk after heavy winds had 
diverted the ship from Prince Edward Island to Sydney, Nova Scotia earlier in 
the cruise. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the crisp New England weather may be what you make it. "It's nice to get 
out of the heat," said Carol Fluhart of Colleyville, Tex., a passenger on the 
Crown Monarch. "The Caribbean? No, thank you." 
</P>
<P>
 The pace of most of the Northeast cruises is slow, and the size of the ships 
that skim the craggy coast generally small. The ultra-luxury, all-suite 
Seabourn Pride, for example, carries just 200 passengers. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're not in a horde. It's not as frantic (as on the larger ships)," 
McCrories said of the 539-passenger Crown Monarch, whose sister ship, the 
Cunard Line's Sagafjord, will take over the New England route this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "People come aboard on Saturday afternoon. By Monday, everybody knows each 
other," said Stephen James, the Crown Monarch's cheerful executive chef and, as 
one of the only New Englanders on the crew, the man called upon to interpret 
the native vernacular. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the ships making this New England run are small enough that all the 
passengers can dine during one seating, or at least find a seat behind the 
windows that provide a view but also protection from the chill winds. 
</P>
<P>
 The former Royal Viking Star spends its first fall as the refurbished Star 
Odyssey this year in New England and eastern Canada. Even the Queen Elizabeth 
II makes an annual five-day visit to the former Colonies, a jazz cruise leaving 
from New York Sept. 19 and stopping in Bar Harbor, Me., Halifax (Nova Scotia) 
and Newport, R.I. The trip will be lengthened to six days next year. The 
Holland-America Line will add a New England cruise in 1995, according to a 
spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 For New England cruises, many people -- mainly East Coasters -- drive to the 
departure port instead of flying. According to the cruise lines, that keeps 
fares comparatively lower than on transoceanic, island-hopping cruises. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the luxury end of the market, the price is a bit lower, because you don't 
have to fold in the trans-Atlantic or trans-Pacific air fare," said Mark 
Flager, spokesman for Royal Viking Line. 
</P>
<P>
 "The idea of getting on a ship that delivers you to your door is 
irresistible," said Carol Supplee of Alexandria, Va., who boarded the Crown 
Monarch there and cruised to Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a shift away from European travel during the Gulf War that forced 
cruise lines to consider the Canadian/New England market. Capacity has 
quadrupled in 10 years, according to the cruise lines association, and the 
number of individual trips has soared from 42 to 72. 
</P>
<P>
 "There weren't any cruises up here, that's why," is Jonsson's theory to 
explain the sudden interest in the market. "People are discovering it now. It 
reminds me a lot of Alaska (before Alaska cruising boomed)." GUIDEBOOK: Autumn

DESTINATION: FRANCE; SPEND THE NIGHT AT MY CHATEAU; GETTING THE ARISTOCRATIC 
TREATMENT AT COUNTRY HOMES WHERE THE CHINA IS FINE AND SO IS THE FOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Lightly dusted with fertilizer, Prince Louis Albert de Broglie stood in the 
garden, hurriedly wiping his hand on his trousers before shaking my hand in 
welcome. He apologized for his appearance -- he'd been moving sacks of 
fertilizer for use in the potager, the walled kitchen garden. I'd just arrived 
to stay in his home -- the elegant Chateau de la Bourdaisiere in the Loire 
Valley -- as a paying guest. 
</P>
<P>
 After he'd washed up and changed, we met for drinks in the salon: a sumptuous 
living room with deep red walls and 8th-Century furniture. Even Versailles 
builder Louis XIV, lover of luxury, would have been at home. The prince fixed 
Kir royales -- Champagne tinted with cre me de cassis -- while he chatted about 
the history of the chateau, which was built in three phases during the 14th, 
16th and 19th Centuries. 
</P>
<P>
 He also told intriguing tales of his family. Among them, stories about three 
women ancestors, true femmes fatales, who owned Bourdaisiere during the 16th 
Century. 
</P>
<P>
 "Marie Gaudin was mistress of Francois I, who rebuilt and expanded the chateau 
for her in 1520," de Broglie said in excellent English. "She was also the 
mistress of Pope Clement VII and Charles V. Her daughter, Jeanne, was the 
favorite of Henry II. And Marie's granddaughter, Gabrielle d'Estrees, was the 
mistress of Henry III and Henry IV (both of France)." 
</P>
<P>
 For Americans, one of the appeals of staying in a real French chateau is that 
they are steeped in aristocratic history; the current chateau owners are often 
descendants of the the rich, the famous, the powerful. I have found this to be 
true in many of the three dozen or so chateaux I have stayed in over the past 
eight years, both for pleasure and in order to research a book I hope to 
someday write on the subject. In addition to being lovely experiences, my stays 
have taught me much about French history and culture; while offering ample 
opportunity for relaxation and fun, they have also provided a personal view of 
France through the eyes of the people who live here. 
</P>
<P>
 De Broglie and his older brother, Philippe Maurice, bachelors in their early 
30s, say they are committed to preserving their home, which has been named to 
France's Monuments Historiques, a government classification for buildings 
deemed important to France's national heritage. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to keep what we've been given and preserve it for the next 
generation," Louis Albert said. That's why a few years ago they began opening 
their home to overnight guests. Visitors provide the income to maintain (about 
$14,000 a year for electricity alone, the owners say) and to improve the 
600-year-old chateau. This includes renovations of bedrooms and bathrooms (the 
chateau has 12 bedrooms set aside for guests). 
</P>
<P>
 The room I stayed in was decorated with antiques and had a large and recently 
remodeled bathroom. Green flowery fabric covered the walls, the windows and the 
decorative canopy over the bed. Like many other chateaux, Bourdaisiere also has 
a swimming pool, tennis courts and horseback riding. Only breakfast is served 
here, however, so visitors need to drive to the nearby town of Tours for meals. 
In and of itself, this is a pleasure, since Tours is rich in history and fine 
restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the chateau requires constant attention, the brothers, once 
professionals working in Paris, (Louis Albert a banker and Philippe Maurice a 
stockbroker, they told me) resigned their positions to take on the chateau's 
well being. They are, consequently, a little broke. 
</P>
<P>
 That's where the guests come in, paying about $150 a night for two to stay in 
their home. 
</P>
<P>
 Just before dusk, Philippe Maurice invited me to look around the property. A 
stone gate led to a road that ran deep into a peaceful forest. The only sounds 
were squirrels scurrying among the leaves, and cuckoos calling. It felt as if 
we were worlds away from modern life, yet we were only about eight miles east 
of Tours. 
</P>
<P>
 While this was not the first chateau I had visited, it was like most of the 
others in its casual, country-home ambience. If it is warm during the day, 
guests wear shorts or jeans; for dinner women wear dresses or slacks; men, 
jackets. 
</P>
<P>
 The downside is that some chateaux don't have telephones in the guest rooms, 
and room service is not available. Guests can come and go as they please, but 
perhaps it is only natural that chateau owners seem interested in who is 
staying in their homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of my stays I have booked through La Vie de Chateau, an association of 
private chateaux that are open to the public (they also list properties in 
England, Scotland, Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Greece). In France, the 
association represents more than 60 chateaux, of which Bourdaisiere is one. The 
booking service costs about $40 per room when reservations are made from the 
United States via an 800 number. 
</P>
<P>
 In the spring of 1993, I stayed at Bourdaisiere for four nights (I recommend 
at least two to provide time for exploration) and enjoyed days of reading, 
taking walks and driving through the Loire Valley, so rich with flowers and 
vineyards. My large upstairs bedroom was named for Gabrielle and, looking out 
the window, I wondered if she ever had time to enjoy the view of the velvety 
smooth lawn and magnificent centuries-old trees. 
</P>
<P>
 When it was time for me to leave, I took my leased Renault on quiet country 
roads, cutting away from the autoroutes on my way west to stay at other 
chateaux. During the weeks of touring, I stayed in several other memorable 
places. 
</P>
<P>
 At Chateau de Saint-Paterne near Alencon, Normandy, I slept in the Henry IV 
room. The ceiling, painted in the 16th Century, was marked with the seal of 
Henry IV, who visited Diane de Courtemanche, one of his mistresses and the 
owner of the chateau. 
</P>
<P>
 Every evening of my six-night stay, Charles Henry de Valbray, the 28-year-old 
aristocratic owner, personally prepared dinner: delicious dishes such as fresh 
poached salmon, lobster souffle, roast lamb and vegetables from his garden. 
This we dined on -- one night two couples from London, the second a couple from 
Paris and me -- with Sevres porcelain, silver and crystal. 
</P>
<P>
 One sunny afternoon, I relaxed in a deck chair on Saint-Paterne's lawn -- an 
expanse of grass leading to a 28-acre oak forest that's also part of the 
property. I thought, how wonderful these chateaux are with their ancient 
stones, witnesses to centuries of history and romance, and their towers 
remnants of medieval pasts. 
</P>
<P>
 At Chateau de Canisy in Normandy -- about 90 miles west of Rouen -- I spent a 
blissful night in what was originally a medieval castle that was enlarged and 
remodeled in the 16th Century. The sitting rooms and 20 bedrooms are absolutely 
wonderful; its round music salon is a gem. 
</P>
<P>
 Canisy's sitting room is furnished with impressive antique wooden furniture. 
My bedroom was light and airy with patterned fabrics on the walls and bedcovers 
and a modernized connecting bathroom. 
</P>
<P>
 The chateaus huge dining room contains imposing furniture and two magnificent 
hunting scenes -- one depicting a leopard cornered by snarling dogs with barred 
teeth; the other a female lion being hunted. During dinner I asked the owner, 
Count Denis de Kergorlay, to tell me about life in the chateau. 
</P>
<P>
 "About 10 years ago, while I was a diplomat living in Thailand, my father died 
and my oldest brother informed me that he'd decided to enter a monastery. He 
asked me to take the chateau, so I came home." 
</P>
<P>
 De Kergorlay redecorated most of the rooms and added modern baths. Three years 
ago, he and his wife begin entertaining paying guests. 
</P>
<P>
 The most impressive and formal of the chateaux I stayed in on this trip, I 
thought de Canisy a perfect retreat for adults. Because of its size and 
grandeur, the owners are looking for groups -- both business people and 
tourists -- although they do accept couples. 
</P>
<P>
 The next morning, as I photographed the count, I looked at the chateau from 
the lake side (actually, the back yard). I tried to locate the windows of my 
bedroom, but there were so many windows in the huge building that I couldn't be 
sure which room I'd slept in. 
</P>
<P>
 A few days later in Brittany, I stayed at the Chateau de Bourbansais -- a 
historic property owned by the de Lorgeril family since 1583, and now run by 
Count Olivier de Lorgeril, another bachelor. The magnificent building has 
mansard roofs, towers and the remains of a dry moat. Upstairs, two rooms, 
elegantly furnished with antiques, are reserved for paying guests. During the 
day, the downstairs is open for guided tours to view antiques and collections 
of memorabilia associated with the history of the family. 
</P>
<P>
 In Picardie, about a two-hour drive north of Paris, I stayed at Chateau de 
Remaisnil -- a property that once belonged to Laura Ashley, the famous British 
decorator and designer. She redecorated the 18th-Century rococo chateau with 
exquisite 18th-Century furniture and tapestries. 
</P>
<P>
 I stayed for two nights in one of Remaisnil's 20 lavishly decorated rooms. The 
current owners, Susan and Adrian Doull, who bought the property about three 
years ago, serve outstanding French cuisine and dined with me and other 
visitors in the elegant, neoclassical grand salon, beneath the flickering 
candles of an ornate glass-and-brass chandelier. 
</P>
<P>
 For me, the Remaisnil stay was woven with many charms shared by other chateaux 
in which I have stayed. One of them is the rare opportunity to see 
museum-quality art and furniture in context -- in settings for which they were 
created. Yet the chateaux are comfortable -- not impersonal galleries with 
guards watching closely to make sure nothing is touched. Staying in a chateaux 
is also a little like being a house guest in another era. And perhaps that -- 
combined with a brush so close to royalty -- is what makes it special.

TAKING THE KIDS: ON THE ROAD WITH OTHER FAMILIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EILEEN OGINTZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's "The Big Chill" . . . '90s style. Between jobs and kids, the three 
boyhood friends -- now in their 40s and scattered across the country -- barely 
have time to exchange a phone call. But come summer, they make time to vacation 
together in Florida with their families along. 
</P>
<P>
 The kids swim. The men fish. The women relax. Everyone has a terrific week. 
"You just pick up where you left off and catch up on each other's lives," said 
Anne Reams, who lives in suburban Chicago and is getting ready for this year's 
trip. "It's the beach, so everyone is very laid back," she said, even with 
eight kids ranging in age from 5 to 11. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the kids arrived, Reams said, the three couples shared a glorious 
sailing trip around the Virgin Islands. Now a couple of condos on the beach 
suits them just fine. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe it's a desire to maintain connections with old friends or forge new 
bonds. Maybe it's not wanting to spend an entire vacation entertaining kids 
bored for lack of playmates. For single parents, maybe it's to make sure 
there's adult company available. Whatever the reason, many families are finding 
that sharing a trip with friends and their kids adds up t o a successful 
vacation. 
</P>
<P>
 They're renting cabins in the mountains, villas in Tuscany, houses on Cape Cod 
and pitching tents side by side in the national parks. In the winter, they 
share condos in ski resorts and Caribbean islands, splitting costs and 
baby-sitting duties and sharing cooking chores along with adventures. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's so much more relaxing than going with family," suggests child 
psychologist Marion Lindblad-Goldberg, of the Philadelphia Child Guidance 
Clinic. 
</P>
<P>
 Lindblad-Goldberg recalls a memorable vacation sharing her family's tiny Nova 
Scotia cabin with her best friend's family. It never stopped raining. 
</P>
<P>
 "We still had a wonderful time," she said. She suggests making sure the 
children have some sort of relationship ahead of time. It also helps if they're 
close in age. And if you're opting for an exotic or remote locale, make sure 
the families truly are good friends. "If you don't know each other that well, 
pick a place where there are other things to do besides just sitting around 
having intimate conversation," Lindblad-Goldberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to respect each other's parenting styles," said Gunnbjorg Lavoll, a 
child psychiatrist who is on the faculty of Northwestern University Medical 
School in Chicago. "Put it all out on the table before you go," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 That includes discussing finances as well as activities, before hitting the 
road. Some groups keep a running tab and divvy up expenses at the end; others 
throw money into a "kitty" and just add more when it gets low. The idea is to 
find a simple system that's comfortable for the group. "You don't want to worry 
about who's eating all of the Oreos or drinking more beer," Reams said. 
</P>
<P>
 You also don't want to get someplace only to discover that the other family's 
idea of fun is lolling around the beach while your crew prefers 10-mile hikes. 
</P>
<P>
 But when the kinks are all worked out, parents and kids alike say these shared 
vacations are some of the best they've ever had -- and the most economical too. 
</P>
<P>
 "As a single parent it's great," said Chicago attorney Lynn Heistand, who 
shares a North Carolina beach house with a close friend every year and also has 
vacationed at Club Med with two other families. "The kids have each other and I 
have companionship too." 
</P>
<P>
 "In the evenings, the children are off playing. It's as if we're out by 
ourselves," adds California travel writer Laura Sutherland, who skis every 
winter with the same friends. 
</P>
<P>
 Sutherland, co-author of "The Best Bargain Family Vacations in the U.S.A." 
(St. Martin's Press, $13.95), knows first-hand that such trips can create 
lasting memories. She still thinks about the wonderful summers she had as a kid 
when her family shared a Lake Tahoe house with friends. "The kids all shared a 
bedroom, and I remember playing cards during the thunderstorms." 
</P>
<P>
 An added plus to these shared trips, Sutherland said, is that parents can 
split the chores and spend more time with the kids. One dad may take them 
fishing while another mom teaches them to water ski and another dad leads 
morning hikes. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, she warns, "Everyone has got to keep their sense of humor." 
</P>
<P>
 It helps to plan separate time during the day. Just because the families are 
vacationing together doesn't mean they have to spend every minute of the day 
together . . . if they don't want to. 
</P>
<P>
 Some couples take turns baby-sitting so each gets at least one evening of 
"alone time." Other families bring a sitter, splitting the cost, so that they 
can go out as often as they like.

HIKING: SCOTLAND; KEEPING YOUR HEAD IN THE CLOUDS ON SKYE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN McKINNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rugged mountains, forested glens and a magnificent coastline draw hikers to 
Skye, one of Scotland's most scenic and storied islands. The island contains 
one of the greatest concentrations of tall peaks in Great Britain, perfect for 
hiking enthusiasts. 
</P>
<P>
 While it is possible to visit Skye as a day trip, the island's charms merit at 
least a couple of days. 
</P>
<P>
 Skye's skyline is dominated by the jagged Cuillin Hills, granite ramparts that 
rise 3,000 feet above the sea. The peaks are usually enveloped in clouds -- one 
reason why Skye is nicknamed the "Misty Island." 
</P>
<P>
 The island's coastline is dramatic, with deep inlets (sea lochs, as they're 
called in Scotland) forming several long peninsulas that look like crab claws; 
in fact, the island itself looks like a giant crab. So deep are the sea lochs 
that even though Skye is 60 miles long and 40 miles wide, no place on the 
island is more than five miles from the sea. Coast walkers may spot whales, 
dolphins, seals, sea otters and flocks of sea birds. 
</P>
<P>
 Though Skye is easily reached on five-minute ferry rides -- from Kyle of 
Lochalsh on the mainland to Kyleakin on the island -- tourism has not yet 
spoiled it. Islanders are proud of their history -- the McCleod Clan, Dunvegan 
Castle, the haunts of Bonnie Prince Charlie -- as well as the island's rural 
coastal villages and the family farms. Many road signs are bilingual -- English 
and Gaelic. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cuillins range includes the heaps of lava forming the Trotternish hills in 
the northern part of the island and the Black and Red Cuillins in the south. 
</P>
<P>
 Highest and wildest of the hills are the Black Cuillins. A seven-mile, 
horseshoe -- shaped trail follows the main ridge and visits Loch Coruisk, one 
of Scotland's most dramatic lochs. 
</P>
<P>
 An island high point is the 3,257-foot Sgurr Alasdair, and a good trail leads 
to the top. 
</P>
<P>
 The Trotternish Peninsula, located only a few miles from lively little 
Portree, has unusual rock formations. The Storr, crown-shaped at 2,360 feet, is 
a rugged two-hour climb. 
</P>
<P>
 Most famous and most photographed of the group of rock pinnacles on the Storr 
Ridge is the Old Man of Storr. The strange Old Man, an isolated, 160-foot-tall 
tower, can be approached by an easy mountain path. The Cuillins, Trotternish 
Trails 
</P>
<P>
 WHERE: Island of Skye, 175 miles northwest of Edinburgh, Scotland. 
</P>
<P>
 DISTANCE: 2 to 14 miles round trip. 
</P>
<P>
 TERRAIN: Wild mountains, grand rock spires and towers. 
</P>
<P>
 HIGHLIGHTS: One of the greatest concentrations of tail peaks in Great Britain. 
</P>
<P>
 DEGREE OF DIFFICULTY: Moderate to difficult.

BACKPACK & BUDGET; LEARN ABOUT JAPAN WHILE TEACHING ENGLISH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LUCY IZON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jobs teaching English in Japan are not as easy to get or as lucrative as they 
were 20 years ago when English teachers were at a premium, says Mark Gauthier, 
author of "Making It in Japan: Work, Life, Leisure and Beyond." But if you want 
to work and travel in Japan, there are still opportunities if you know how to 
look for them. 
</P>
<P>
 University graduates who want a foreign experience and have enough seed money 
to get started, can do it. "You will find a job, but the speed in which you 
find a job and the quality of it will depend on the presentation of yourself." 
</P>
<P>
 The 232-page guide is packed with advice and information that will help the 
traveler settle in one of the world's most expensive countries. 
</P>
<P>
 Topics vary from visa and immigration procedures to job hunting, economical 
options for finding and furnishing an apartment, calling home, health care, 
banking, transportation, recreation, tax, teaching tips, shopping and exploring 
the culture. 
</P>
<P>
 What you know before you go can make a difference. The book points out that 
you should pack the original copy of your university degree. "Because many 
foreigners have shown up with copies of fake degrees . . . most schools now 
require you to produce the original." 
</P>
<P>
 Information is given about the various English-speaking services that can help 
you when you don't speak any Japanese yourself. There are English libraries and 
special telephone numbers for English-language railway and tourism information. 
Most subways and trains have English translations and there is bilingual 
television and several English-language daily newspapers and magazines. 
</P>
<P>
 To keep day-to-day costs under control in a city where a movie can cost five 
times what you would pay in North America, Gauthier says that on Sept. 1, Dec. 
1, March 1 and June 1, movie tickets are sold for half price. 
</P>
<P>
 Other cost-cutting subjects include: where to find "all you can eat" 
restaurants in Tokyo and a variety of lodging options from home stays and 
staying in a Zen temple to spending a night in a capsule hotel (only the length 
and width of a single bed). 
</P>
<P>
 "Making It in Japan: Work, Life, Leisure and Beyond" is published by Sanseido 
Co., Ltd., Tokyo. In North America copies can be ordered directly from the 
author for $12.95 plus $3 postage and handling, at 59 Maywood Road, Kitchener, 
Ontario, Canada N2C 2A2.

'GOOBER' GROUPIES

 J.D. Crowe's delightful article about the Grand Canyon ("Rim Shots," July 3) 
offered a new perspective about a well-visited spot. The illustrations were 
wonderful and the article offered sound suggestions that are easy to accept 
(Goomerella's new boots = a no-no).My 20-year-old son enjoyed it as much as I 
did. Send J.D. Crowe out in the field again.

 What a pleasant surprise "Rim Shots" was. Charming and funny, it was a welcome 
change from the standard photos and text and it engaged me immediately! Of 
course, being an artist, I have to say that there's no substitute for the 
visual language of drawings and paintings.

 J.D. Crowe left out another group, which we could call the "groaners": Those 
hardy folk who ride downstairs on the backs of donkeys. I was a groaner some 
years ago (year forgotten -- price $13.50), and I can tell you we were 
definitely a separate group. 
</P>
<P>
 When I mounted, my beast let out a protest that could probably be heard at the 
Phantom Ranch. We passed Goobers and Goomers at a slow but dizzy pace. Due to 
the downward slope of the trail, and the lack of shock absorbers on our mounts, 
there was considerable bouncing on the four-hour descent. 
</P>
<P>
 After a bag lunch at the river, we headed back top, some five hours away. The 
trip up was less bouncy, but, alas, too late for comfort. Oh, yes -- the 
scenery was gorgeous.

MORE ON CANADA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 We've just returned from Canada and feel that Christopher Reynolds' article, 
"Weakening U.S. Dollar Still Finds Strength in Canada" (July 17), is way off 
base. Granted, our stronger dollar means that 28% discounts off Canadian prices 
should be in effect, but numerous stores and hotels across the border are 
giving tourists only a 20% discount.In addition, even after allowing for 
exchange-rate differences, many prices are at least 50% to 200% higher than in 
the U.S. due to high taxes and greed. Examples: Banff Springs Hotel and Chateau 
Lake Louise are charging $251, hotel dinners are running $178 for four without 
drinks, bar drinks are $4.55 to $6, a Big Mac at McDonalds costs $3.75 and so 
forth. Lodges on the U.S. side were $102 per night for lakefront. Tourists 
beware.

 Reynolds says the Goods and Services Tax (GST) is not applied to meals, 
beverages, tobacco, rental cars, gasoline, airline and train tickets. 
Unfortunately, for both residents and visitors, the GST is applied on all those 
items. What you should have said is that the GST paid on those items is merely 
not refundable to visitors. I think this is what you were trying to say, but 
your wording leaves the impression that the tax is not applied.

ABOUT THAT ELEPHANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I couldn't help but feel disgusted by Susan Olenick's criticism of the "My 
Best Shot" of the painted elephant (Letters, July 17). Has she been in India 
and has she seen it? I have. This custom has been going on for centuries with 
no harm to the skin of the animal. I agree that our children should be taught 
respect toward our environment, and it should start with graffiti and 
vandalism, which doesn't exist in India. 
</P>

 In India, elephants and human beings have worked together for millennia. And 
just like the rider and his or her horse (should we also ban photos of saddled 
and bedecked horses?), the people who work with elephants have a great deal of 
love and respect for them. And Ganesh, the boy god with the elephant head, is 
one of the most beloved Hindu gods. 
</P>
<P>
 RICHARD HARRIS, Pasadena 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Regarding Olenick's letter and the letter objecting to Norway's whaling 
practices (July 24): Oh, we are such purists in the United States. It seems 
every week someone has to pick apart other cultures and livelihoods. Do these 
same people realize that we no longer have grizzly bears, wolves, bison, wild 
mustangs and pronghorn antelope running free? Let's re-evaluate our own 
circumstances before we lash out at other countries. 
</P>
<P>
 JAN MILLER, Hermosa Beach 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 The photos that are chosen for the Travel section give readers a great insight 
into other cultures. Olenick's letter did not take into account that these 
pictures are not representative of practices that are condoned by The Times, or 
even our culture. 
</P>
<P>
 SUSAN SAN CINELO, San Dimas 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Olenick doesn't understand how India reveres the elephant. Perhaps the story 
my father told me would enlighten her: 
</P>
<P>
 Outside his hotel in New Delhi's elegant diplomatic enclave, my father noticed 
an elephant in the parking lot, attended by a devoted keeper. My father asked 
the hotel staff what the elephant was doing there. "Why, sir," said the desk 
clerk, "he lives there. That's his home." 
</P>
<P>
 If Olenick feels disgusted and shocked by India's respect, she must realize 
how the elephant is treated in the West. Believe me, the animal is better off 
in India. 
</P>
<P>

 OK, Susan, you've made your point. Now, put away your lipstick, mascara, 
eyebrow pencil and all those other goodies you have stashed in your handbag.

HARRY BELAFONTE; HUMANITARIAN, SINGER, WRITER, PRODUCER. HARRY BELAFONTE IS 
STILL EXERCISING HIS VOICE TO DEAL WITH PROBLEMS CLOSE TO HIS HEART. 'SO MUCH 
OF MY LIFE IS SPENT DEALING WITH ISSUES OF RACE,' HE SAYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Donna Rosenthal, Donna Rosenthal is a free-lance writer based in Berkeley. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Harry Belafonte nominally lives in New York, but his artistic and humanitarian 
projects take him all over the globe -- helping to immunize African children, 
meeting with Crips and Bloods in South-Central Los Angeles to help them 
maintain their truce, galvanizing the U.N. General Assembly with speeches about 
helping the planet's troubled and needy youths. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, as it happens, he is in the Bay Area, wearing the hats of humanitarian 
and UNICEF special ambassador -- meeting with George Lucas at his Skywalker 
Ranch to discuss ways to use cutting-edge Hollywood technology to help UNICEF 
further the causes of needy children -- and of director, scouting locations for 
his upcoming Turner Broadcasting movie "Port Chicago," about a little-known 
incident during World War II with dire consequences for African American 
sailors. 
</P>
<P>
 Over lunch at Lucas' vast spread at Skywalker Ranch, Belafonte and Lucas put 
their heads together about technological ways to change education and help 
needy kids. "We talked about a possible economic war on the information 
superhighway," Belafonte says, "and I stressed the need not to ignore poor 
children who will be opted out of the new system. We agree that information 
(especially interactive methods of education) should be accessible to all 
children of America." The meeting went well, Belafonte and Lucas both say 
afterward, and the two are planning to meet again in the fall to plan 
strategies. 
</P>
<P>
 On the drive south from Skywalker, Belafonte smoothly shifts his perspective 
to director preparing to shoot a film. "Port Chicago," which will begin filming 
next year, is set at the naval base on Suisun Bay near Concord (now part of the 
Concord Naval Weapons Station) that was the site of a horrifying event in 1944 
-- an event that Belafonte, 67, nearly experienced. 
</P>
<P>
 After dropping out of a Harlem high school, Belafonte joined the U.S. Navy to 
fight in World War II. The Navy was segregated at the time, and in 1944, before 
his imminent transfer to Port Chicago, two military ships loaded with 
ammunition exploded there, killing 320 people, mostly black seamen, leveling 
Port Chicago and breaking windows in the St. Francis Hotel, 35 miles away in 
San Francisco. "It was the worst home-front disaster of World War II," says 
Belafonte, "but almost no one knows about it or what followed." 
</P>
<P>
 When, after the blast, black seamen refused to load ammunition under the same 
unsafe, segregated conditions that sparked the explosion, 50 of them were 
convicted of mutiny and sentenced to prison; after the war, under pressure from 
NAACP attorney Thurgood Marshall, the Navy reduced their sentences. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Port Chicago mutiny was one of America's ugliest miscarriages of justice, 
the largest mass trial in naval history and a national disgrace," says 
Belafonte. He credits Ted Turner and his staff with having the courage to put 
the story on television. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lucas educational project and the Turner TV movie are just two of several 
projects -- most sharing a deep concern for the human condition -- that 
Belafonte has on his front burner right now. The others include: 
</P>
<P>
 * Co-producing, with Jonathan Demme directing, a feature film version of 
"Parting the Waters" for TriStar, based on the Pulitzer Prize-winning Taylor 
Branch book about America during the Martin Luther King Jr. years. 
</P>
<P>
 * Producing a film for the BBC and HBO called "Black Tuesday," about a black 
soldier in the segregated U.S. Army in World War II who was unjustly charged 
with rape and hung in London. 
</P>
<P>
 * Co-writing, with Robert Altman, a film examining racism in America during 
the "Amos 'n' Andy" era called "Cork." 
</P>
<P>
 * Playing himself in "Pret-a-Porter," Altman's upcoming satire on the fashion 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
 * Playing a '30s gangster in "Kansas City," Altman's next directorial effort. 
</P>
<P>
 * Planning a world concert tour, possibly as early as fall of '95, 
incorporating music from Third World cultures that he has worked in. An album 
of the music is also in the works, for next year. 
</P>
<P>
 * Leading a fact-finding mission in Rwanda and Zaire, for which he leaves 
Tuesday, to investigate the needs of refugee children, in his role as UNICEF's 
goodwill ambassador. 
</P>
<P>
 As fiery and certainly as productive as ever, Belafonte is nonetheless keenly 
aware of his age. "I'm not fearful of death, I'm really not," he says 
wistfully. "I'm just frustrated by the nagging demands of so much to do and so 
little time. When I was 40 looking at 60, it looked a thousand years away. Now 
80 looks like a week away." With great intensity, he vows, "I'm not going out 
with a whimper." 
</P>
<P>
 And in that light, he admits, "I haven't been so busy since the civil rights 
movement." Belafonte -- never one to seek the spotlight, and in fact someone 
who dislikes publicity and doesn't generally even employ a publicist -- was 
extremely visible in the '60s with marches, voter registrations, boycotts and 
arrests, as well as advising and fund-raising for the Rev. Martin Luther King 
Jr.  
</P>
<P>
 He has been putting his own money where his beliefs are since the runaway 
success of his 1956 album "Calypso," the first LP to sell more than 1 million 
copies. The profits he received from that album allowed him to tackle one of 
his first civil rights projects, and an extremely personal one: He was able to 
buy an entire Manhattan apartment building from a racist landlord who had 
refused to rent to him. Belafonte and his wife, Julie, have lived there for 
more than 37 years.  
</P>
<P>
 "So much of my life is spent dealing with issues of race," he says with a 
sigh. "I wish I could just get out of bed and just think about film or music. 
Black people spend an inordinate amount of time dealing with the race issue. I 
lost a lot of my friends to racism, including one of my dearest -- Martin 
Luther King Jr." 
</P>
<P>
 Belafonte's best friend, Sidney Poitier, describes him as "a caldron of 
intellectual and social energy. He pours a lot into life and he demands a lot 
from it."  
</P>
<P>
 So does Belafonte relish being an activist?  
</P>
<P>
 "No," he insists. "It's sucked up most of my life."  
</P>
<P>
 Nelson Mandela put it this way in a letter of congratulations upon Belafonte's 
winning the 1990 Nelson Mandela Courage Award, given by the Washington-based 
Trans-Africa Forum, in honor of his tireless work on behalf of civil rights: 
"Harry would not sing, if he could not speak." 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond his art, Belafonte is continuing his commitment to activism, speaking 
out against atrocities in countries such as Rwanda, Bosnia and Haiti and 
working quietly in South-Central Los Angeles to reach out to children and to 
gang members. 
</P>
<P>
 On June 16, for example, Belafonte was awarded a U.N. prize for his tireless 
work with African children. He then proceeded to stun the packed U.N. General 
Assembly by inviting a 12-year-old from Watts to join him onstage to deliver an 
acceptance speech for him. The boy, Jasen Trotter, told his gripping story of 
life in South-Central L.A. and pleaded with the international delegates not to 
forget America's own children. He and Belafonte received a standing, teary 
ovation. 
</P>
<P>
 And since January, Belafonte has been visiting housing projects in 
South-Central Los Angeles, advising the Crips and Bloods how to maintain their 
fragile 2-year-old truce and forge ties with Latino gangs. "I'm bringing people 
together," he says modestly, "helping them hammer out differences, embrace 
commonality and find outside assistance." He is also advising Latino and black 
gang members about starting businesses, from manufacturing clothing and ice 
cream to selling machine parts. In addition, he's about to start innovative 
literacy and math programs with his civil rights activist colleague Bob Moses, 
director of the Cambridge, Mass.-based Algebra Project, which began in 1982 as 
an outlet to help urban students link math to everyday problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since we made peace," says Fred Williams, the former Crips leader who is now 
involved in maintaining the truce and running Common Ground, a program to help 
at-risk youths in South-Central, "there've been a lot of publicity stunts 
(involving politicians and leaders dropping by South-Central for photo ops and 
little else). We're sick of being used as political steppingstones. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one but Harry understood the significance of this truce or offered real 
resources. I've never met a brother like him. This man is a gem; he understands 
raw guys like me from the projects, sees our needs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We never asked him for money. Without even telling us, he called Hollywood 
friends and came up with $200,000 in two weeks," Williams adds. "Because of 
him, we can keep gang mediation teams on the streets, making sure the 
Crips-Bloods truce doesn't fail this summer." 
</P>
<P>
 "These kids need to see black men who can commit to them and show them other 
ways to define maleness than carrying Tech 9 guns," concurs Constance Rice, who 
works closely with the gangs as counsel for the NAACP Legal Defense Fund. "They 
don't sit and listen to many people, but they listen to Harry. Harry was in the 
same spot they're in. He was raised by a single mother, courted by gangs. He 
was saved by Paul Robeson and Dr. W.E.B. Du Bois, the giants in the Harlem 
Renaissance community -- who do these kids have?" 
</P>
<P>
 "The few giants who affected my life made a major difference," Belafonte 
agrees. "Young Americans today don't even know who Dr. King was -- it's very 
painful. Where did we go wrong? Just days before his assassination, Dr. King 
was in my apartment and we discussed his nagging concern that perhaps we were 
integrating into a burning house. That thought has proved to be most 
prophetic." 
</P>
<P>
 Belafonte pauses and turns deadly serious. "There's a race war knocking at the 
door. Our country is in chaos and the media is keeping a lid on it. We have to 
do something about the moral collapse of this country. But we can't form a 
social movement without a common vision about how to change the country's 
direction." 
</P>
<P>
 The urge to form a new social movement propelled Belafonte to invite an 
eclectic group of 70 community leaders from across the nation last May to a 
closed-door meeting at the historic Highlander Center near Knoxville, Tenn. One 
of the few places in the South where blacks and whites mixed freely in the 
1930s, the Highlander Center became a key training and organizing place for the 
civil rights movement. 
</P>
<P>
 The three-day meeting ignited passions reminiscent of those years. Orin Lyons, 
chief of the Onondaga Tribe of the Iroquois Nation, described it as "a council 
of good minds." Civil rights leaders such as Roger Wilkins, Bob Moses and 
Pastor James Lawson met with black and Latino gang members. Such public figures 
as Lani Guinier, Cornell West and Danny Glover shared ideas with the 
unemployed, farm workers, labor leaders, economists, rabbis and ministers. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was one hell of a historic meeting," says Williams, who came with a group 
of Crips and Bloods. "Harry was the reason for us being there -- he was the 
group's spiritual force. I have never seen a group of people of that caliber. 
No one cared about titles -- we talked heart to heart." 
</P>
<P>
 Belafonte says that he called the meeting because "we have a desperate need 
for leaders -- men and women of vision, who are going to make a difference and 
help guide the course of the human family into the 21st Century and beyond." 
The group plans to meet again in late August, although the exact details are 
secret because participants want no publicity. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not the first time Belafonte has galvanized a group on a large scale. In 
1985, he brought together 45 performers, from Michael Jackson to Bruce 
Springsteen, to record "We Are the World," raising millions of dollars in 
emergency assistance for Africa. He then helped set in motion Hands Across 
America to address problems of hunger in America. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet with all of these accomplishments, Belafonte is still not satisfied. One 
dream that has eluded him so far is what may be the project dearest to his 
heart: a miniseries based on the life of Nelson Mandela, which he has been 
trying to get launched for seven years. "It sits on death row waiting for a 
reprieve from ABC, which I doubt will happen," he says, looking very upset. 
Poitier had been set to play Mandela, alongside a cast that included Marlon 
Brando, Jane Fonda, Susan Sarandon and Glover. 
</P>
<P>
 "How could you go wrong with this cast?" he asks. "But as history in South 
Africa kept erupting, ABC got nervous about where it might be leading and 
stonewalled. Five years ago, it was a sexy idea to my co-producers. . . . Now 
that Mandela's in office, they find nothing sexy about making a film about 
democracy." (Judd Parkin, a senior vice president of ABC Entertainment, says 
that "the project is not in active development at this point.") 
</P>
<P>
 "We're still plagued by an (entertainment) industry unwilling to make films of 
historical substance. They're unwilling to focus primarily on anybody of color, 
because they don't consider these films bankable. The philosophy still is 'keep 
it light, be entertaining.' As a consequence, we're entertaining ourselves into 
utter apathy." 
</P>
<P>
 Altman echoes Belafonte's sentiments. "With so little art in the film 
business," he says, "it's a shame that Harry's valuable messages can't reach a 
wider audience." 
</P>
<P>
 Belafonte has never had an appetite for Hollywood game-playing. He describes 
his tactics in Hollywood as "guerrilla warfare: You move in, take your moment 
and get out before it kills you. I say no to a lot of unacceptable film 
projects, knowing that I can go to London or Tokyo for a concert and find a 
welcoming public. And it pays the rent." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, he says, it's important for him to find quality time to spend with Julie, 
his four children and two grandchildren, as well as keep the flame burning for 
world change. 
</P>
<P>
 He recently told a multicultural group at UC Berkeley's International House, 
"If I were to pick one word that's the most strategic to human interchange and 
human thought, it would be the word difference . But people are so afraid and 
intimated by difference. Many people are manipulated to be intimidated by it. 
Many people manipulate it for evil ends. Others embrace difference so we can 
understand more about each other. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is in difference that we find the opportunity to learn, to love, and to 
serve. It is in difference that we find the center to our own humanity."

IT'S ALL IN THE STARS; THERE'S REALLY NO LOGICAL ANSWER TO THE QUESTION OF WHY 
STARS MAKE WHAT THEY DO.; BUT HERE'S A LOOK AT SOME OF THE MANY AND VARIED 
REASONS THAT ONLY SEEM TO MAKE SENSE IN HOLLYWOOD.

 Until just after the Fourth of July, movie stars were taking a drubbing at the 
summer box office. New films featuring Eddie Murphy, Kevin Costner, Julia 
Roberts were shot down in flames, rekindling Hollywood's age-old debate: Why 
are stars paid so much money when they can't even open a movie? Then along came 
Tom Hanks in a box of bonbons called "Forrest Gump," followed by Arnold 
Schwarzenegger in "True Lies" and, most recently, Jim Carrey in "The Mask." And 
the argument was turned on its side. "The truth is," says one senior studio 
executive, "no star is worth the money you pay him -- except in the right 
movie." 
</P>
<P>
 And therein lies the classic Hollywood double-bind. There are about half a 
dozen solid reasons why studios pay upward of $7 million (dollar figures today 
are merely guarantees against a potentially larger profit share) to secure the 
likes of Murphy, Costner, Roberts, Hanks, Schwarzenegger, Mel Gibson, Sylvester 
Stallone, Tom Cruise, Harrison Ford, Michael Douglas, Robin Williams, Sharon 
Stone, Bruce Willis, Whoopi Goldberg and now Carrey. And only one very good 
reason why they shouldn't. The Wrong Movie vs. the Right 
</P>
<P>
 A star in the right movie -- Hanks in "Forrest Gump" -- can generate a 
$24-million opening weekend on a film despite its inscrutable title and lack of 
other obvious marketing hooks. Even in the wrong movie, "Last Action Hero," for 
instance, a Schwarzenegger can draw $15 million from the curious on opening 
weekend. The right Schwarzenegger movie, "True Lies," brought in almost twice 
that much. 
</P>
<P>
 How do you tell the difference? It's almost impossible. "Studio executives 
sometime become much too excited about the obvious," says "Forrest Gump" 
co-producer Steve Tisch. "We've all seen examples of actors who, because of 
their newly acquired power and leverage, are packaged into the wrong movies. 
The illusion that excitement creates overlooks some real problems."  
</P>
<P>
 When a star is in the right movie, such as Costner in "The Bodyguard," the 
rewards can be astounding -- a worldwide theatrical gross of $500 million. When 
he's in the wrong movie, "Wyatt Earp," shirts can be lost. The $60-million 
Western, which clocked in at more than three hours, will gross only about $25 
million domestically. 
</P>
<P>
 But it's important to know that the one begat the other. The decision to 
commit to "Wyatt Earp" with Costner came in the wake of "The Bodyguard" and his 
two other period-piece blockbusters, "Dances With Wolves" and "Robin Hood: 
Prince of Thieves." 
</P>
<P>
 In the unlikely event that Warner Bros. had decided against the movie, other 
studios would have tripped over their spurs to get it. 
</P>
<P>
 "You always have to count back 12 or 24 months to find the point on the 
calendar when the decision was made to get the star and pay him," says producer 
and former studio executive Sean Daniel. Even Disney, the one studio known for 
being hesitant to cough up $7 million or more even for the right actor in the 
right movie, will occasionally pony up and pay someone like Roberts her asking 
price on a film like "I Love Trouble." 
</P>
<P>
 "The thing is, if it hits with Julia, it hits bigger," says one Disney 
executive. And even if it doesn't, as was the case with "Trouble," the studio 
needs a couple of "loss leaders" every year -- flat-out star vehicles "that 
show you're still in the business," according to the executive. The Mediocrity 
Meritocracy 
</P>
<P>
 The nature of the film business is such that the average cost of a film is now 
between $40 million and $50 million -- $25 million just to produce and the rest 
for marketing and advertising. The impetus to get many of these films off the 
ground is that finite group of star performers. "They give studios a sense of 
security," says David Schiff, an agent at United Talent Agency. "Sometimes it's 
a false sense of security." 
</P>
<P>
 The insurance the studios are buying is to protect them from their own 
mediocrity, says a senior studio executive. A great concept movie like "Speed" 
sells itself, while with a dud, like "Toys," even a big name like Robin 
Williams can't sell it. Stars are for everything in between. "The truth is, 
most movies are not really terrible and most are not truly great," says the 
executive. "Most of them are just OK. A star is there to help those mediocre 
movies make money." 
</P>
<P>
 This attitude, says another studio executive, is a reflection of the poor 
management that prevails at most studios. "The studios are struggling with 
material. They just don't have it," says the executive. "So all they're doing 
now is filling in slots -- especially summer and Christmas (which between them 
account for 60% of the year's business). To greenlight those movies they need a 
big star name. And so they're forced to pay big star prices." 
</P>
<P>
 A recent example is Fox's "Crisis in the Hot Zone." Despite continuing script 
problems, it was given the go-ahead because Robert Redford and Jodie Foster had 
agreed to star. When Foster dropped out, the project came close to falling 
apart. The Short List 
</P>
<P>
 How do actors get on that select list of names that has studios panting for 
their services? Usually on the heels of a surprise commercial success -- 
Roberts in "Pretty Woman," Willis in "Die Hard." Carrey leaped onto the list 
with "Ace Ventura: Pet Detective," going from $650,000 a film to $7 million 
overnight. "The actor establishes his price when the market is most favorable," 
says UTA's Schiff. "And success has a funny way of securing that position. You 
have a long time to disprove yourself." 
</P>
<P>
 Another way for an actor to climb on the list is an accrual of fine supporting 
performances, which seems to be the way Tommy Lee Jones is headed. Standout 
performances in support of Harrison Ford in "The Fugitive" and Steven Seagal in 
"Under Fire" have led to co-star outings in "The Client," "Blown Away" and the 
upcoming "Natural Born Killers" and "Batman Forever," gradually upping the 
actor's price ($5 million for "Batman Forever"). Whether he can carry a film 
solo, however, will be the ultimate test, and should his starring role in 
"Cobb," the Ty Cobb biography due for release later this year, be a substantial 
hit, Jones could be breathing the rarefied air of the Short List denizens. 
</P>
<P>
 At all times, however, the list remains small and is based on a number of 
factors, a primary one being foreign appeal. Certain actors, especially action 
stars (Schwarzenegger, Stallone, Willis, Seagal, Jean-Claude Van Damme), have 
become commodities to be bought and sold on the international market. "Whether 
he opens a movie or not, it's the ultimate economic results that justify the 
actor's fee on the next film," Schiff says. 
</P>
<P>
 Since action films often gross twice as much abroad as in the United States, 
Van Damme and Seagal are major stars offshore. Most of their films do well here 
but clean up overseas. Christopher Lambert is the exception of an actor who is 
a major action star overseas but not in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on the success of "Speed," Keanu Reeves has been penciled onto the list 
of action stars. "It will take months and years before the movies that came out 
of that momentum are looked at," says Daniel. Depending on the outcome of those 
films, Reeves will either move onto the permanent list or be scratched off. 
</P>
<P>
 A component in Reeves' favor "is that Tom Cruise and Kevin Costner can't star 
in every movie," says Tisch. "Besides, Cruise and Costner are in a position to 
develop their own material. That makes it tougher for me as a producer and I 
have to pay more for actors on the next level." The Teflon Coating 
</P>
<P>
 The old saying "you're only as good as your last picture" doesn't apply to 
today's highest-paid stars. Once they're at a certain level, stardom creates a 
Teflon coating, shielding the actor from mistakes. In the industry, "Wyatt 
Earp" is considered an honorable failure, a film with high ambitions that 
didn't quite come together. Despite the losses incurred in making it, were 
Costner up for grabs (he's already filming another mega-budget film, 
"Waterworld," for release next summer), there would still be a stampede for his 
services. And they would pay his asking price -- said to be $10 million to $12 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 If Costner's no lesser a star after "Earp," neither is Roberts following "I 
Love Trouble." She is protected by her appearance in three of the most 
successful women's vehicles in recent years -- "Pretty Woman," "Sleeping With 
the Enemy" and "The Pelican Brief," all of which grossed northward of $100 
million. And were a producer with a starless script to get a commitment from 
Roberts, the project would find financing overnight. 
</P>
<P>
 Schiff makes the comparison with the sports business. If a baseball player has 
a multiyear, $15-million contract and has one bad season, he argues, the 
contract isn't canceled. "He still draws fans to the games and to the sport 
itself. There are additional values." 
</P>
<P>
 "When Julia Roberts stars in a movie," says entertainment attorney Peter 
Dekom, "it creates a higher awareness on the part of the audience and the 
press. Until such time as that's no longer true, she can command big bucks." 
</P>
<P>
 The most in-demand stars not only have Teflon coatings, they develop infrared 
bomb deflection devices. "No one blames Robin Williams for the failure of 
'Being Human' or 'Toys,' " says one industry source. That ignominy goes to the 
films' creators, Bill Forsyth and Barry Levinson, respectively. But Williams, 
and not necessarily director Chris Columbus, is credited with the mega-success 
of "Mrs. Doubtfire." 
</P>
<P>
 Does anyone remember that Tom Cruise's "Far and Away" was a misstep? Do you 
suppose when he offered his services for "Interview With the Vampire" that 
anyone suggested that he should take a cut in his reported $12-million per film 
salary since his last period piece didn't work out? No, the project went from 
being a long-awaited adaptation of an Anne Rice novel to a potential 
blockbuster starring Tom Cruise. 
</P>
<P>
 Producer Wendy Finerman spent nine years waiting to get "Forrest Gump" made. 
And one of the main reasons it did get made, says co-producer Steve Tisch, is 
Hanks (along with in-demand director Robert Zemeckis and screenwriter Eric 
Roth). The industry will recognize Zemeckis and Roth's contributions. But to 
the public, it's a Tom Hanks film. Hot to Un-hot 
</P>
<P>
 Teflon, like any other coating, is subject to erosion. Eddie Murphy's coating 
may have been damaged, if only temporarily. Industry insiders still consider 
him bankable, "a continuing delusion," says one studio executive. "Beverly 
Hills Cop III" was a disappointment from the standpoint of cost ($65 million 
with his salary alone eating up $15 million). And he is coming off a bad run, 
including "The Distinguished Gentleman" and "Boomerang." 
</P>
<P>
 "To get cold takes two or three movies that have contempt for the audience," 
says the senior studio executive. "Eddie has one more chance with (the 
upcoming) 'The Nutty Professor.' Otherwise he'll suffer the Burt Reynolds 
syndrome. He'll have trashed his career." 
</P>
<P>
 But, counters entertainment attorney David Colden, "Murphy still has a 
following if he's in the right vehicle." And as was true with a Bill Murray or 
a Sylvester Stallone, career lulls are made to be broken. That's why even 
during a down time, certain actors maintain their high prices.  
</P>
<P>
 "There's always a chance that the actor's next film will be the one you want 
it to be," Daniel says.  
</P>
<P>
 For Murray that slump-breaker was "Groundhog Day"; for Stallone, 
"Cliffhanger." But since "Rocky," Stallone has never not been a star. "Some 
actors remain stars no matter what," says Colden. "Studios will take risks on 
those actors, especially within a specific genre, hoping to hit the lottery on 
the next one." 
</P>
<P>
 What stars do in the meantime, suggests Dekom, is maintain the appearance that 
they're not taking a salary cut -- like demanding the same gross participation 
in a film but not taking a salary up front. Another alternative is to either 
lower the cash amount or the profit percentage. 
</P>
<P>
 "Studios will look for an opening to cut a salary if they can," Daniel says. 
"Agents will look for an increase or to hold the line. Studios rarely succeed." 
</P>
<P>
 Some actors who've had some bad luck try to climb back up by taking 
assignments in which they can shine but don't have to carry the film. Bruce 
Willis, for one, has done cameos and small roles that redefine his parameters 
as an actor. He's been garnering great notices for the upcoming Quentin 
Tarantino film "Pulp Fiction," which had a budget of $8 million -- or almost 
half of what Willis will reportedly be getting to star in "Die Hard III." 
</P>
<P>
 One star whose name rarely appears on the high-priced list, but is as big as 
most of those names, is Clint Eastwood. He is unique among the short-list 
players in that his long-term agreement with Warner Bros. waives big up-front 
payments in favor of a large share of a film's profits. Consequently, says one 
top agent, his films come in under the $25-million average, allowing him to 
experiment with projects like "White Hunter, Black Heart" and "Unforgiven." The 
former failed and both he and WB took their lumps. The latter was an Academy 
Award-winning blockbuster and everyone went home much richer. Gender and Genre 
</P>
<P>
 The "price club" is almost exclusively male. The reasons are that the most 
reliable genres are action films and comedies -- which are male-dominated -- 
"and that most movies are written for men," says one producer. 
</P>
<P>
 The exceptions are Roberts, Sharon Stone, Whoopi Goldberg and Barbra 
Streisand. "Women, regrettably, have less to gain and less to lose," says 
Schiff. "They're rarely called on to carry movies and rarely given credit for 
their success." 
</P>
<P>
 However, top-ranking women are not given as many chances to fail, says the 
talent agent. And Roberts and Stone are no exception. "They have to be 
extremely careful about their material," says the agent, who is putting his 
money on more consistent and varied actresses like Jodie Foster, Meg Ryan and 
Michelle Pfeiffer. 
</P>
<P>
 The same devaluation afflicts dramatic actors, male and female, although there 
are a select few -- Robert De Niro, Meryl Streep, Al Pacino -- who command high 
prices because they bring a certain critical cachet to their projects, despite 
the hit-and-miss performance of their individual films.  
</P>
<P>
 Performers like Streisand, Redford and Dustin Hoffman set themselves apart by 
doing fewer films than they're offered. Consequently, each outing becomes an 
event -- at event prices. 
</P>
<P>
 It would only be a slight exaggeration to say that such names as Cruise, Ford 
and Hanks attached to a film version of the Los Angeles white pages would merit 
serious consideration from studios. Each has proven himself in various genres. 
And their percentage of recent hits to failures is extremely favorable. "The 
fact that they could do the phone book, however, doesn't mean that they 
should," says the talent agent. What Price Stardom? 
</P>
<P>
 Those are the reasons certain stars can and do get megabucks for their films. 
But are they really worth it? In terms of glamour and appeal, probably so. When 
it comes to overall profitability of the movie business, maybe not. 
</P>
<P>
 As Daniel points out, the really profitable pictures this year have been "Four 
Wedding and a Funeral," "The Crow" (both independently released) and "Speed" -- 
films without big box-office names and, consequently, much lower budgets. "The 
high profit margins come from the surprises," Daniel says. 
</P>
<P>
 A hit movie with box-office names, a film such as "Maverick," not only costs 
more (reportedly $60 million) because of star salaries, but is ultimately less 
profitable for a studio because actors like Gibson retain what is called "first 
dollar gross": They get a percentage of the gate from every ticket sold, even 
before the studio recoups its investment. The top stars get between 10% and 15% 
of the gross. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to subtract at least $20 million of the profit from hit movies with 
stars who have gross participation," says Daniel. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you have more than one gross player," says the Disney executive, "in order 
for the studio to make money, it has to be a really big success." 
</P>
<P>
 But from the studios' viewpoint, says the talent agent, "they're happy to 
collect their distribution fee (35% of receipts) and overhead (15% of the 
budget). So the talent comes out OK and so does the studio, even though films 
like 'Rain Man' and 'Batman' don't technically break even." 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, the rate of return on movies today is "pretty shabby," according to 
Dekom, who quotes a recent Variety statistic placing the figure at around 8.7%. 
A better-performing mutual fund returns 10% to 13%, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "It used to be that the studios saw rates of return between 30% and 50%," says 
Dekom. "Those profits have gone to actors and some directors. They're the ones 
who make that profit today." 
</P>
<P>
 Does that mean actors will eventually price themselves out of the market? "In 
theory, yes," says Dekom. "In reality, no."*

AS HER MANY WORLDS TURN; LISA LOOMER IS A PLAYWRIGHT WHO ALSO WRITES FOR 
(GASP!) TV SITCOMS. AND THEN THERE'S THE LATINA THING. SO, HOW DOES IT ALL WORK 
TOGETHER? VERY WELL, THANKS.

 It's another semi-sweaty afternoon in a Mark Taper Forum rehearsal room. Two 
actresses seated on hospital gurneys are running through the final scene of 
Lisa Loomer's "The Waiting Room," which opens at the Music Center theater this 
week. Two other actresses are waiting in the offstage area, hidden by screens. 
</P>
<P>
 The playwright is seated at a table. There are also stage managers and 
assistants nearby. Yet what's striking is that all of these people are women. 
In fact, of the 10 folks in the room, director David Schweizer is the only man. 
</P>
<P>
 A female-to-male ratio like this shouldn't be as remarkable as it is, but it's 
almost unheard of in a place like this. And while current rhetoric might 
suggest that Loomer, who is a Latina, stands out on the Taper writer roster 
because of her ethnic identity, it's really the fact that she's a woman that 
makes her presence so unusual. 
</P>
<P>
 This, after all, is the mainstream American regional theater, where for all 
the attention that's been paid in recent years to matters of ethnic diversity, 
little has been done about gender equality. In fact, the situation for female 
playwrights is no better now than it was a decade or more ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Case in point: "The Waiting Room" is the only play written by a woman that 
will be at the Taper this season or next. And while Los Angeles may see the 
occasional touring production of a work by a female writer -- such as Wendy 
Wasserstein's "The Sisters Rosensweig," currently at the Doolittle -- the Taper 
remains the city's most prominent producer of new works and thus highly 
influential. 
</P>
<P>
 Loomer's "The Waiting Room" is a much-needed exception to the norm. Developed 
and previously staged at the Taper's New Works festival, the script brings 
together three women from three different centuries and cultures in the waiting 
room of a contemporary doctor's office. It tackles such provocative issues as 
society's changing ideals of female beauty and the inadequacies of women's 
health care, albeit with humor. 
</P>
<P>
 "She deals in one play with a woman who has breast cancer from bad implants, a 
woman who can barely walk from her feet being bound and a woman who has been so 
severely corseted that all of her inner organs have been crushed," says Taper 
producing director Robert Egan, who shepherded the script into New Works. "And 
it's a comedy." 
</P>
<P>
 The mix of controversy with lightness is a Loomer trademark. "Lisa has the 
ability to merge a zany irreverent comedic sensibility with serious issues 
about being a woman in today's world," Egan says.  
</P>
<P>
 A playwright who's had works staged at such prestigious theaters as South 
Coast Repertory, the Kennedy Center, the Public Theater, the American Place 
Theater and more, Loomer has also penned film scripts, TV movies and miniseries 
and worked for TV producer Linda Bloodworth-Thomason's series "Hearts Afire" 
and the upcoming Bloodworth-Thomason show "Women of the House." 
</P>
<P>
 "Lisa is always on the cutting edge of social change and whatever is going on 
in the country, but never in any kind of politically correct way," says 
Bloodworth-Thomason. "She'll have a unique viewpoint. Her sense of humor is 
quirky. She's also very pro-female." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet even with the steady TV gig, from which she is on leave, Loomer returns to 
the stage. That's because the theater affords her a forum in which to address 
topical issues in a way that TV won't allow. "It's creative freedom," Loomer 
says. "You're only limited by your imagination." 
</P>
<P>
 As one of the few playwrights who does continue to work in the theater even 
with a healthy screenwriting career, Loomer's used to fielding skepticism. 
"Before they get to know me, people in television expect me to be serious and 
intellectual because I'm in theater," she says. "And people in theater are wary 
of my being a laugh whore." 
</P>
<P>
 N ew York's INTAR (International Art Relations) has long been one of the most 
fertile training grounds for Latino theater artists. It was there, in a lab led 
by playwright Maria Irene Fornes in 1985, that Loomer first began writing 
plays. 
</P>
<P>
 "She certainly taught us how to contact our imaginations and free our minds," 
says Loomer of Fornes, who also teaches at L.A.'s Padua Hills Playwrights 
Workshop-Festival. "In working with her, I began to distinguish between what's 
clever and what's humor. Clever is more from the head; humor is more from the 
whole being, the character," Loomer continues. "Clever wasn't what I was after. 
It wasn't that I simply intended to be funny, but that comedy was a way to get 
at something else." 
</P>
<P>
 The distinction is central to Loomer's spirit and style, which is often 
whimsical, but seldom frivolous. In fact, the matters at the heart of "The 
Waiting Room" are some of the most grave -- literally, life-and-death -- that 
she's ever dealt with, although she does it with wit and irony. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's about perceptions of beauty that are perpetrated by a male-driven 
industry -- the irony being that when you suffer the physical repercussions 
it's another male industry that tries to take care of you," Egan says.  
</P>
<P>
 One of the play's most controversial touch-points is breast cancer, the 
disease that felled Loomer's own mother. "A lot of what drove me in this play 
has to do with her fight and the need for freedom of choice in health care," 
the playwright says.  
</P>
<P>
 "If you get sick in America, you will be exposed to the therapies that the 
medical Establishment supports," Loomer continues. "And from the research I've 
done, there is a connection between medical Establishment interests and the 
interests of big business that has to do with the lack of access to 
(alternative) therapies." 
</P>
<P>
 Loomer's other plays -- including "Bocon!," "Looking for Angels," "Cuts" and 
"Chain of Life" -- have been seen in Germany and Mexico, as well as in a 
variety of venues in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Loomer, who lives in Sherman Oaks, has been represented locally by a 1991 
Odyssey Theatre Ensemble staging of "Accelerando," a quirky romantic pas de 
deux between a bassoonist and a ballet dancer recovering from a broken foot. 
Her only brush with the L.A. majors prior to "The Waiting Room," though, was 
when her first full-length play, "Birds," premiered in 1986 on the second stage 
at South Coast Repertory Theatre. (Loomer had also taken part in the inaugural 
year of the Hispanic Playwrights Project there during the previous summer, 
where the script was workshopped.) 
</P>
<P>
 Set partly in Mexico during the late 1960s and early 1970s and partly in 1980s 
L.A., "Birds" traces three decades in the life of the Vasquez family, a 
fictional clan whose experiences have some parallels with those of Loomer's own 
family. 
</P>
<P>
 L oomer, who is of mixed Spanish and Romanian ancestry, was born and raised in 
New York, although her family moved to Mexico when she was in her late teens. 
She stayed in the United States for school, spending summers and making other 
visits to see her parents in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 "Usually people have their youth (in Mexico before coming to the United 
States), but I had a lot of late teen and early 20s major life experiences 
there instead," says Loomer, who refuses to give her age but is around 40. 
"It's an odd thing in my writing because they did go that way instead of coming 
this way." 
</P>
<P>
 The time spent in Mexico gave her a unique perspective. "Maybe part of the 
reason I'm not as linear, logical or naturalistic as some is that I did spend a 
lot of time in a culture that was not driven by linear expectations, where the 
boundaries between life and death, between the literal and the fanciful, are a 
lot looser." 
</P>
<P>
 After graduating from Brandeis, Loomer started her theater career as an 
actress and comic, but soon became frustrated with the limited repertoire of 
roles for women and especially Latinas. She turned, as actors frequently do, to 
writing monologues for herself, which led to several one-woman shows that she 
performed in the early 1980s in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Her forte was an array of comedic personas, long before the multi-character 
monologue format became as popular as it is now. Loomer also began honing her 
stand-up skills with a group called Legal Action, then the in-house group for 
Manhattan's West Bank Cafe. 
</P>
<P>
 Both pursuits proved grist for the mill once Loomer wended her way to INTAR 
and Fornes in 1985. Since then, Loomer has done better than most women in terms 
of getting her work staged, perhaps partly because she's come into her own 
during a period in which the theater has paid particular attention to ethnic 
representation. 
</P>
<P>
 "The climate has changed significantly and the theater climate has eased a 
bit," says playwright-screenwriter Jose Rivera. "There's a strong desire among 
people who run theaters to place before their audiences populations that are 
part of this country that they might otherwise not see." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet those same people have done next to nothing about the underrepresentation 
of female writers. "What's been hard for us recently is choosing and balancing 
a season with all of the constituencies that we try to serve," says the Taper's 
Egan of the dearth of female playwrights produced on the Taper main stage. "We 
can do better in that area, I'm not going to deny that. We just have to be more 
vigilant." 
</P>
<P>
 Loomer may be the lucky one at the Taper this year, but she's aware that her 
position is singular. "I am passionate in support that there be more venues for 
women, but I can't tell you that I've experienced prejudice," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 And even the comparatively fortunate Loomer knows the idiosyncrasies of the 
mostly male workplace. "I know that if I'm sitting in a room and there is a 
male producer, a male director, a male dramaturge and a couple of other men, 
they will be a little more at ease with each other because they're used to 
dealing with each other," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 T here's as much difference be tween theater and film as be tween the 
centuries to which the women of "The Waiting Room" belong. Yet Loomer has found 
ways to adjust her working process for each medium. 
</P>
<P>
 "I approach theater completely differently from TV," she says. "I wait and one 
scene comes to me, then another, then a character. I don't write linearly. In 
television and film, you are required to do a story outline, which means that 
you know what will happen before the characters really come alive." 
</P>
<P>
 It's an accommodation that she's learned to make, although it hasn't always 
been that easy. The trick, she says, is to get to know which tasks from each 
discipline are compatible. "There are some things that you can do at the same 
time," she says. "I can punch up a television script at the same time as I'm 
doing first-draft playwriting. But I find it hard to do a real original 
television script or a movie and a play at the same time." 
</P>
<P>
 The collaborative process is also different in TV than it is in theater, and 
the way the small-screen game is played tends to throw into relief the 
peculiarities of being a woman in what's still mostly a man's realm. "I've had 
the experience of being the only woman on a staff and that's absolutely wild. 
Comedy in television is kind of an aggressive game, especially as played by 
men." 
</P>
<P>
 Call it sitcom machismo. "Where if you were in a room of male businessmen, 
they might be talking about how much money they made or where they vacationed, 
in a room of comics, they've got those jokes going loud and fast," Loomer says. 
"That's their way of being men and comics at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not my nature. I'm not that kind of funny. But the upside of it was that 
these guys are funny and they're fun to be in a room with." 
</P>
<P>
 Both those guys and Loomer, however, have to remember that there are limits. 
"(Loomer) has a good set of brakes on her," Bloodworth-Thomason says. "She 
knows just how daring to be. She has the guts to do more, but she also has the 
good sense to work within the framework and she can adapt herself to any 
medium. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's not a snob about television," Bloodworth-Thomason continues. "Lisa 
understands that having her writing shown on a small box in someone's living 
room doesn't diminish that work." 
</P>
<P>
 L oomer is at least realistic about the pluses and minuses of working on 
sitcoms. "It's fairly formulaic, although there are people who take chances," 
Loomer says. "I don't know that it changes the world, but sometimes there's one 
little thought that many, many people hear. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once on 'Hearts Afire' we had a story about a senator, played by Rita 
Moreno," Loomer continues. "She didn't have a Latin name, but people got to see 
the juxtaposition of 'Latin woman' and 'senator' and that to me was very 
satisfying." 
</P>
<P>
 Both Loomer and Rivera -- author of "Marisol," "The Promise" and other plays 
and the creator-writer-producer of the 1991 NBC series "Eerie, Indiana" -- have 
carved out careers as television writers apart from shows with any significant 
Latino content. Yet neither has been able to parlay that track record into 
realizing the goal they share of bringing a Latino-oriented show to prime-time 
network television. 
</P>
<P>
 "This Latino silence on TV is a paradox," Rivera says. "There's a sincere 
desire on the part of the networks to make a Latino show a reality, and there's 
certainly no lack of rhetoric. On the other hand, it's still hard to get any 
show on television, let alone a Latino show." 
</P>
<P>
 "The concern is that if it's too particular to the Latin culture, the Anglo 
culture won't find a door in," Loomer says. "I think that if you show what is 
particular about a culture, chances are it will also be what is human about the 
people of that culture." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet until the TV industry comes to agree with Loomer on this and other issues 
of concern to her, the playwright will continue to turn to the stage. "There 
are some very controversial issues in 'The Waiting Room,' " she says. "I don't 
think these issues will be dealt with on television, and sometimes even the 
movies steer away. The theater does offer that freedom to deal with issues that 
aren't talked about on television and film."* Vital Stats

COLLECTING WITH A VISIONARY 'I'; AN L.A. EXHIBITION PROVIDES A UNIQUE LOOK AT

<P>
 There's shopping and then there's collecting. Fifteen years ago, Sydney and 
Audrey Irmas began shopping for the occasional photograph, initially influenced 
by their daughter, photo historian Deborah Irmas. 
</P>
<P>
 After buying an 1862 albumen print by the eccentric Nadar, who photographed 
himself dressed in a fringed Native American costume and wearing an 
18th-Century-style wig, the couple decided to narrow their focus to 
self-portrait photography. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the decisive moment that turned their shopping into collecting. They 
have since assembled a collection of approximately 140 works by artists as 
traditional as Edward Weston and as unconventional as Bruce Nauman, all 
revealing some unique aspect of themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 The Irmases recently donated their collection to the L.A. County Museum of 
Art, where it will be presented as the exhibition "The Camera I: The Audrey and 
Sydney Irmas Collection of Photographic Self-Portraits," opening Thursday. 
Spanning the last 150 years, the collection brings together works both by 
unknowns and superstars, artists who use some aspect of photo-reproduction and 
commercial photographers, Americans and Europeans. And more women are included 
than in most institutional collections. 
</P>
<P>
 This selection of self-portraits is remarkable in no small part for the 
surprises it may bring to even the most seasoned observer of photography. As 
Deborah Irmas notes in her essay for the lavish book documenting her parents' 
collection: "We made many quixotic and idiosyncratic choices, records of the 
changes in our taste over time. . . . To choose freely, because of one's 
interest in an image, without pre-existing requirements, is often the most 
difficult of tasks." 
</P>
<P>
 Deborah was still in graduate school at Boston University when the collection 
was formally launched. Her parents relish the tale: Sometime around 1973, 
Sydney remembers, when his daughter was home for Christmas vacation, she asked 
him to buy her a Karl Struss photograph from the Stephen White Gallery for 
$200. The dealer would not sell the picture until the opening night of the 
show, at which point Deborah would have returned to the East Coast. Sydney 
agreed and asked her to also pick out a few more photographs that he could 
purchase for himself. 
</P>
<P>
 "She gave me the numbers of the photos," recalls Sydney. "I went to the 
opening, made the deal, wrote the check. And I bought (an image) of Catalina 
Island because my family comes from there. (Stephen White) put red stars on the 
six things I bought. I figured I'd better stay a little while, have a glass of 
wine. A man in an overcoat, hat and suit rushed in. He says to Stephen, 'My 
wife sent me out here to buy five photographs!' Well, they were the exact five 
Deborah had picked out. 
</P>
<P>
 "(The man's) wife was a well-known photo dealer in New York. A few days later, 
I got a letter from her asking if we were willing to sell and for how much. At 
which point I got great respect for Deborah. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was Karl Struss' first show at a gallery. He was 91 years old, but he 
was at the opening. We talked because he had been a cinematographer at the 
studios. I worked in the mail room at Fox when I was 17 years old." Laughing, 
Sydney adds, "So we both came from a background in film." 
</P>
<P>
 It was an auspicious beginning for the new collectors. The little-known Struss 
was soon discovered by the art world, and in no time his work increased in 
value by 200%. 
</P>
<P>
 But just collecting photography seemed too broad a mandate for the Irmases. 
Audrey says: "I don't like pretty pictures. I tire of them easily. When it was 
first suggested that we collect photographs, I visualized Ansel Adams, and 
thought, 'I'm not interested in that.' Until we zeroed in on the 
self-portraits. It was so interesting to see how different people are willing 
to reveal themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a lot of fun in the beginning because there was so much material 
available. It was difficult toward the end to find things we didn't already 
have." Adds Sydney: "Or that met our requirements of being vintage prints." 
</P>
<P>
 Today, the Irmases live in an expansive modern beach house in Malibu, 
furnished by Mimi London with large-scale comfortable furniture. Glass walls 
reveal waves crashing outside. Inside is a single self-portrait photograph by 
the renowned German artist Joseph Beuys. Most of their photo collection is now 
at LACMA, and the walls of the house indicate the direction of their passion 
for contemporary art, with works by such artists as Barbara Kruger, Jenny 
Holzer, Eva Hesse, John Baldessari, Edward Ruscha and Malcolm Morley. A 
painting by Kenneth Noland hangs in the hallway. Many other pieces are in 
storage awaiting completion of the couple's new home in Holmby Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 One work, featuring text on metal by Cady Noland, Sydney bought for personal 
reasons: It refers to Patty Hearst and her escapades with the Symbionese 
Liberation Army. Now retired from his practice as an attorney, Sydney defended 
Hearst in the L.A. component of the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Visiting galleries and buying photography helped the Irmases develop their 
sensibility, and their avid interest in contemporary art brought them to a new 
association with the Museum of Contemporary Art, where Audrey is now a trustee. 
Paul Schimmel, MOCA chief curator, applauds the Irmases' generosity to the 
institution, but notes that their photography collection belongs at LACMA, 
where it will be integrated with extensive existing photographic holdings. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert A. Sobieszek, LACMA curator of photography, concurs: "Fundamentally, 
their collection is the history of photography, from 1850 to the present, 
centered around a single theme -- self-portraiture and the artist. So it fits 
into our general collecting desire. It's almost as though we are collecting the 
same way they did -- wonderful 19th-Century pieces, modernism up to the 1940s, 
with half the collection that is post-1940. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think self-portraits, in whatever medium, are interesting," Sobieszek says. 
"Psychology, temperament, biography, we are all fascinated by what goes on in 
the mind of the creative person. And it is good photography. The examples 
(they) collected are really remarkable. I don't know of any other collection in 
the U.S. or in Europe where a collector has amassed a collection of 
self-portraits." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Deborah Irmas acted as adviser at the outset, her mother became the 
primary force behind the collection. 
</P>
<P>
 "My mother has a good eye and likes classically beautiful things," says 
Deborah by phone from her home in Paris. "Once you let my mother loose, you 
cannot stop her. What's interesting is that they didn't really get any social 
credit for it," she continues. "I was at parties at their house where people 
were saying, 'Why do they collect this stuff?' My mother was very sensitive to 
that and the fact that she continued to collect is to her -- to both of their 
-- credit." 
</P>
<P>
 Hesitantly, the elder Irmases do take some credit. "It's rewarding to know 
that what we've been doing for 15 years is validated by others. It's pleasing 
to know you had an eye and went down the right road. If you collect something, 
it should be what is pleasing to you, not to others," Audrey says. 
</P>
<P>
 In the early 1970s, collecting photography did not have today's cachet. 
Nineteenth-Century photographs were especially abundant and, by today's 
standards, were reasonably priced. 
</P>
<P>
 "We made some wonderful buys and we made some mistakes," Sydney adds. For 
example, they thought their F. Holland Day photograph of a man in an Arab 
costume was a self-portrait and exceptionally rare, since most of Day's 
photographs were lost in a 1907 studio fire. After the donation to LACMA, it 
was discovered that Day had photographed a friend. "We kept it for 15 years 
believing it was the creme de la creme of the collection," Sydney moaned. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were sold what we were told was a self-portrait by Baron (Adolphe) de 
Meyer. One day, (the late photography collector) Sam Wagstaff came over and 
said, 'That's not Baron de Meyer. That's his chauffeur!' No matter how hard we 
tried to make sure of what we were getting, mistakes happened." 
</P>
<P>
 And miracles happened too. One day, two different dealers offered them 
self-portraits by the reclusive photographer Robert Frank. They managed to 
reach Frank by telephone and discovered these were the only two such prints in 
existence. They bought both. 
</P>
<P>
 D ealers often called to offer them pictures. Robert Miller Gallery's Howard 
Reid tipped them off to the sale of the Diane Arbus self-portrait up for 
auction at Sotheby's. The startling 1945 black-and-white print shows the young 
photographer nude except for a pair of white cotton underpants, her belly 
slightly enlarged by her pregnancy, standing next to a view camera on a tripod 
photographing herself in a mirror. The image was made to announce her pregnancy 
to her husband, at the time a soldier stationed overseas. 
</P>
<P>
 It was unique in Arbus' oeuvre and certain to go above the auction house's 
estimate. At auction, the Irmases watched other collectors bid up the price. 
"Our strategy was not to bid, let others bid and see where it went," Audrey 
says. "It more than doubled in price, the bidding was so fast, and just as the 
auctioneer says, 'Is that it?' I shot in a bid. Everyone was so surprised that 
I got the piece for $20,000. It was one of the most expensive (of our 
collection). Within two months, I'd been offered more than $40,000 for it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I loved collecting photography," she adds. "I really miss it." 
</P>
<P>
 The Irmases decided to donate their collection to a museum in 1992, after a 
scare from Westec private security officers. "They called to say they felt the 
house in West L.A. was on fire. The first thing I thought about was the photo 
collection," Audrey recalls. "They called back and said the house wasn't on 
fire, but I didn't want the responsibility after that. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to share (the collection)," she continues. "I wanted people to go 
see it. We always wanted it to be at LACMA because Syd was born (in L.A.) and I 
spent my whole life here. Our children and grandchildren are here for the most 
part." 
</P>
<P>
 Sydney agrees. "The incentive was the connection to L.A., and a desire to have 
L.A. be the recipient of these pictures." 
</P>
<P>
 Says Audrey: "When Robert came and picked up the photographs, I felt as though 
my children were leaving home to go to college. I thought of the many years I 
had devoted to them. Robert said, 'When the opening comes, it will feel as 
though they've graduated.' "*

FILM CLIPS / CATCHING UP WITH: PENNY MARSHALL, HEARTILY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Judy Brennan 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Renaissance Man" director Penny Marshall is a woman who seems to have gone 
through her own renaissance, at least on a small scale, this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 The actress/director, 50, suffered a sudden attack of severe chest pains, 
widely believed to be a heart attack, on May 28, and was rushed to a hospital 
in Southhampton, N.Y., on the eve of the opening of "Renaissance Man," her 
fifth film. 
</P>
<P>
 Marshall, who has also admitted to having a four-pack-a-day cigarette habit, 
now says that she did not suffer a heart attack and that the rumors of her 
imminent demise were greatly exaggerated. In fact, she has been especially 
active lately, exuberantly cheering Barbra Streisand recently at the Pond of 
Anaheim and now busily promoting "Renaissance Man" in Australia. 
</P>
<P>
 "Geez, I wouldn't be running around if I was still sick!" Marshall said on the 
phone from Sydney. "I just got overworked and stressed out. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know, they (Disney) moved my release schedule (on the film) up six weeks 
and I wasn't prepared, so I really had to push it." In fact, she says, she did 
not finish the film until the day of the cast-and-crew screening. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a grandmother, for God's sake! Whew, it was a push. I had chest pains. So 
I went into the hospital for a day. You know, I wanted to take a day off 
anyway." 
</P>
<P>
 By May 29, Marshall was back trying to do publicity for the film, which 
premiered May 31 and opened nationwide June 3. After the premiere, she said, 
she checked into a spa for a brief rest, then headed for New York and Los 
Angeles to do television interviews. Since then, she has simply tried to catch 
her breath. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I learned from this? You wanna know?" she says in her trademark Bronx 
accent. "Well, it's this: I will never , ever push a movie six weeks early 
again. I should have said no." 
</P>
<P>
 Especially when she considers the poor box-office performance and what some 
involved in the film called Disney's lackluster promotional push on the movie 
in a summer packed with movies. The film, which stars Danny DeVito as an 
unemployed ad executive who begrudgingly takes a job teaching eight troubled 
Army recruits, has brought in about $23.5 million at the U.S. box office, which 
doesn't cover the picture's cost, although Marshall said that the final tally 
on the picture was nowhere near the rumored $40 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a huge summer crunch of movies. And Disney was in a rush to get 
movies out this summer," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Marshall would have preferred to release "Renaissance Man" in September; the 
back-to-school period would have worked, she said, since it's basically a film 
about education.  
</P>
<P>
 "When they released this in Michigan," Marshall said, "kids were still in 
school. And the teachers in Detroit gave the kids credit if they went to see 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 So did audiences miss the point of the movie? Would Marshall change anything 
about it if she could go back and tweak the finished product? 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, first, let me say, you're talking to somebody who's still trying to fix 
'Laverne & Shirley'!" Marshall, a star of that TV show, said. "But I think the 
people who saw this movie did get it. The exit polls on this movie were high." 
It was also a film, says one source involved in the movie, that was generally 
considered the fourth or fifth choice on most moviegoers' lists, given this 
summer's lengthy menu of prospects. 
</P>
<P>
 But Marshall isn't blaming Disney for being distracted by "The Lion King." "No 
one wants to lose money," she says. "But with so many releases it makes it hard 
for Disney to handle all of these films at one time." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, she said, she's trying to do what she can to sell the movie overseas. The 
film opened in Australia Thursday and will open in Europe in September.  
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, she's co-producing "Getting Away With Murder," a romantic 
comedy starring Dan Aykroyd and Lily Tomlin, for Savoy Pictures. After that, 
she's mulling a number of directorial projects she considered a few years ago 
when she was at Columbia Pictures.

FILM CLIPS / FAMILIAR FACES, UNFAMILIAR PLACES: THEY'RE NATURALS FOR 'QUIZ 
SHOW' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Claudia Eller 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Movie directors are normally happy to create their magic behind the scenes and 
let their actors bask in the spotlight. But once in a while, they too like to 
step in front of the cameras. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest high-profile filmmakers to do just that are Martin Scorsese and 
Barry Levinson, both of whom have key bit parts in Robert Redford's Sept. 9 
film, "Quiz Show," a provocative drama based on the real-life late-'50s scandal 
about the rigging of the popular nationally televised game show "Twenty-One." 
Redford, who clearly enjoys being on both sides of the camera himself, says, 
"Most directors I know are hams." 
</P>
<P>
 In the film, Scorsese plays the fast-talking, hard-edged head of the company 
that produces Geritol, the quiz show's advertising sponsor, and Levinson 
portrays the bow-tied Dave Garroway, host of NBC's "Today" show. 
</P>
<P>
 The film stars Oscar-nominated actor Ralph Fiennes ("Schindler's List") as 
Charles Van Doren, the popular Columbia University professor who became the 
quintessential quiz show contestant; John Turturro as Herbert Stempel, the 
disenchanted contestant who blew the whistle on the program's producers for 
duping the public, and Rob Morrow as Richard Goodwin, the young Washington 
attorney who led a congressional investigation into the quiz-show fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 Scorsese, notes Redford, "has his own personal style and delivery, so I found 
it interesting to have him play a tough character gently. And given his 
delivery style, in which he talks real fast, I thought it would make the 
character extremely menacing." 
</P>
<P>
 Redford said that Scorsese also fit the physical type he was looking for. 
Because of legalities, Redford couldn't use the real-life likeness or name of 
Matthew Rosenhaus, the late chief executive officer of the J.B. Williams Co., 
the toiletries company that owned Geritol. So the director fictionalized the 
character, avoiding naming him, basing his look and manner more on Charles 
Revson, the ill-tempered president of Revlon, sponsor of "The $64,000 
Question," another TV quiz show that was scrutinized during the scandal. 
</P>
<P>
 As for Levinson, Redford said that he has been friends with him since the two 
made "The Natural" in 1984. "There's a part of Barry that likes to perform and 
he is fascinated with the '50s. So when I was thinking about casting Dave 
Garroway, I thought of Barry because he has that kind of easygoing, casual 
manner." 
</P>
<P>
 Redford said that when he called Levinson and said, "Do you want to have some 
fun?" the director immediately said yes. What he didn't know, laughed Redford, 
"was that I was going to throw a monkey at him" -- literally.  
</P>
<P>
 Levinson had to act opposite a nervous chimpanzee who was portraying 
Garroway's famous sidekick, J. Fred Muggs. According to production notes on the 
movie, because there were no movie-trained chimps available for the scene at 
Rockefeller Center, the production hired another chimp "who was unnerved by the 
lights and cameras." 
</P>
<P>
 Redford recalls Levinson saying to him, "The bow-tie is one thing, but a 
monkey?" 
</P>
<P>
 Levinson's production company, Baltimore Pictures, which he previously ran 
with longtime producing partner Mark Johnson, originally developed "Quiz Show" 
at TriStar Pictures before Disney's Hollywood Pictures acquired the project. 
</P>
<P>
 Redford said that working with Levinson and Scorsese as actors in the movie 
"was great fun." 
</P>
<P>
 But, more important, were they paid scale? 
</P>
<P>
 "Yep."

FILM CLIPS / Q & A: FORREST GUMP'S PROUD DAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Robert Epstein 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The "house that Forrest Gump built" in Magnolia Springs, Ala., was sold 
earlier this year. That's the house writer Winston Groom bought with part of 
the reported $500,000 Warner Bros. paid him for the movie rights to his 1986 
first-person book about a low-IQ country boy/man. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then Groom, 51, moved to Point Clear, Ala., where it's easier for him to 
find a tennis game. Paramount (which got the film in turnaround from Warner 
Bros.) finally released the movie and now some folks in Mobile plan to honor 
the writer with a tickertape parade in October (after the summer heat passes) 
and a civic banquet to aid a local retarded-support group, and a proposal to 
name a new city-county complex the Forrest Gump Building.  
</P>
<P>
 "Damn," Groom says, "if they do it I will come." 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, life for the writer has become like a box of his own chocolates -- he 
never knows what he's going to taste. 
</P>
<P>
 And right now Groom is tasting a lot of different chocolate: 
</P>
<P>
 * The Paramount movie, starring Tom Hanks, continues as one of this summer's 
box-office successes, grossing more than $140 million in four weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 * Pocket Books, a division of Paramount, has gone into a 10th printing of the 
1986 "Forrest Gump" book, which is on several bestseller lists. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Gumpisms: The Wit and Wisdom of Forrest Gump," an 88-page quickie 
collection of aphorisms by Groom/Gump, is in its fourth printing. 
</P>
<P>
 * An audio version of the book read by Groom has been brought out and three of 
his earlier novels will be reissued by Pocket Books. 
</P>
<P>
 And there's more. 
</P>
<P>
 There's Groom's next book, a nonfiction history, "Shrouds of Glory," an 
accounting of the last big Confederate army campaign in the Civil War to attack 
Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 And now he is about to do something about his unlikely hero, Forrest Gump. 
Groom and his wife, Anne Clinton, have headed to a retreat in the North 
Carolina mountains where, with his new tape recorder ("the best one I could 
buy, the kind detectives use") he's working on a sequel, taking Gump and his 
son from the late '80s to the present. "And that will be it. There will never 
be a 'Forest Gump 5 or 6,' " he says. 
</P>
<P>
 The former Washington Star writer has seven books to his credit; his first, 
the 1978 Vietnam novel "Better Times Than These," was followed by the 
nonfiction "Conversations With the Enemy" with Duncan Spencer. 
</P>
<P>
 "My wife and I," he says of his Gumpian experiences, "are still trying to 
figure out what just hit us." 
</P>
<P>
 Question: How did "Forrest Gump" get from Warner Bros. to Paramount? 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: When the book was in galley proofs, Warner Bros. and Steve Tisch bid 
for it with Wendy Finerman shepherding the deal. I wrote the first three script 
drafts and then Warners put it into turnaround and Paramount picked it up with 
Tisch and Wendy. 
</P>
<P>
 In writing the scripts, I tried to stay close to the book, and that was a 
mistake. 
</P>
<P>
 When Paramount got involved the writing was turned over to Eric Roth. Wendy 
and Paramount kept me in the loop through the various versions that followed. 
We kept them factually and historically on the track, like assuring them that 
Bubba, who is a black soldier in the movie, no way would have been playing 
football for Bear Bryant at Alabama in those days, as they had him in at least 
in one version. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: When did you first see the movie? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I couldn't make the Hollywood premiere because I had a terrific assignment, 
researching and writing about the top 10 vacation resorts in the Southeast for 
a travel magazine, so an old fly fisherman friend of mine, Milton Brown, got 
Paramount to throw a party for me in Mobile, taking over the Carmike Theater 
for one night in early July. I invited a whole lot of people to see it. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What was your reaction to the movie? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I felt disembodied for the first 10 minutes seeing my work in two 
dimensions and hearing my words on the lips of actors. Then I just started to 
watch it like everyone else. It's a good movie. At one time I heard some 
sobbing in the audience but I was so busy watching the show I didn't look 
around to see who it was. You understand, this was not a hostile audience. 
</P>
<P>
 The stars of the movies had signed a framed one-sheet poster of the movie and 
wrote notes to me and it was presented to me that night. I told the audience 
I'd have to build a new house just to accommodate the one-sheet.  
</P>
<P>
 Right after that someone offered me $2,000 for each signed first edition of 
"Gump" I had. I told him I only had 10 copies and eight were going to Bob 
Zemeckis, the director, and the cast. I kept two for my kids. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: The word gump is an old slang term for a stupid or foolish person. Is that 
how Forrest got his name? 
</P>
<P>
 A: That's news to me. Many years ago I shopped at the Gumps store in San 
Francisco and for years they kept sending me their catalogues. The name sort of 
stuck in my head.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Most of your writings have been serious, about Vietnam or Southern 
corruption. Then there's "Forrest." 
</P>
<P>
 A: Well, "Forrest" was humorous, but serious in its own way. My first book was 
serious but had humor. Another book, "Only," was a look at the world through 
the eyes of an old sheep dog. That was fairly humorous. 
</P>
<P>
 I like being funny. I was editor of the humor magazine at the university. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What university was that? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Alabama, of course. There's only one university in Alabama when you say the 
university. In my lizard brain days, that's what I wanted to be, an editor, but 
I got my mind changed because nobody hired me after college. I applied to 
Newsweek and Esquire and they told me I needed experience. Eventually I went to 
work as a writer for the Washington Star. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: The book "Gumpisms" is an obvious spinoff from the movie. How did that come 
about? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I was off Florida fly-fishing for a couple of weeks. When I got back my 
agent said Paramount had an idea about a book of Gump sayings and they were 
giving me four weeks to do it and I had already used up two. 
</P>
<P>
 "How can I write that in two weeks?" I said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you want the money, you will," was what my agent said. 
</P>
<P>
 I had a date in New York to do the audiobook reading of "Forrest," so I took a 
train and got a compartment, had meals brought in, and by the time I got to New 
York half of "Gumpisms" was done. Then on the train back I wrote the rest. 
Remember, I grew up with great-aunts and great-grandmothers in the South 
sitting on a porch in the summertime telling stories. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Now you're ready to do a sequel to "Gump." 
</P>
<P>
 A: I was reticent to do it. I told Pocket Books I had to see the movie and 
think about it. Then, finally, I came up with an idea for the sequel and with 
the book ending in the '80s I was left with only (a few) years of current 
history. So I settled on Big Forrest and Little Forrest. The boy is going to 
grow up ashamed of his stupid daddy. A generational thing.  
</P>
<P>
 I've bought only two new things since the movie came out. One is a fancy tape 
recorder. Worse thing in the world for a writer is to think about something 
great and then not remember it. The other thing I bought was a stereo set after 
Paramount sent me a copy of the soundtrack.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Did you find the movie true to the book?  
</P>
<P>
 A: I think so, in this way: It's true to the character of Forrest. Movies can 
change characters, but Bob Zemeckis kept the dignity of Forrest. I wasn't 
delivering any messages other than showing that a man doesn't have to be rich 
or smart to be dignified. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Did you know a Forrest Gump? 
</P>
<P>
 A: No, but my daddy sort of did. He died this year at age 87 and was a lawyer 
in Mobile. A few years ago, I was living in New York and would come down in the 
winter to warm up. On Sundays we would have lunch. At one of these lunches he 
reminisced about this fellow he once knew, an older man who was slow-witted but 
whose mother had taught him to play the piano. His story struck something 
inside me and then I saw a "60 Minutes" show about idiot savants. After Daddy 
left I started making notes and by midnight I had the first chapter of "Forrest 
Gump." 
</P>
<P>
 I called my agent and told him to get me a deal. I wrote the first draft in 
six weeks, working without a net, no notes or outline. The book literally wrote 
itself. I have a cousin who is a big psychiatrist in Alabama and I asked him if 
someone with an IQ of 65 or 70 could do the things I had Forrest doing and he 
said he could do it all physically. He said the reader would have to suspend 
reality and allow the character to accomplish what I wanted. 
</P>
<P>
 ABC did a show here and they had some retarded people see the movie about 
Gump. They all seemed to love it. And that's important that they knew I wasn't 
making fun of them.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How about the other characters? Was there a Lt. Dan, a Bubba, a Jenny? 
</P>
<P>
 A: As a writer, I make up lies. Writing is all about invention. Truman Capote 
once said to me, "Make it up, it's all a bunch of crap." This, you understand, 
is foreign to what a journalist does.  
</P>
<P>
 Lt. Dan is probably me since I was an officer in Vietnam. If there's any 
autobiographical stuff in this it would be Lt. Dan. He and Jenny were 
philosophic characters. They became bitter; I didn't. You know, Hollywood 
invented the embittered Vietnam character. None of my Vietnam buddies are that 
way. 
</P>
<P>
 As for Bubba -- listen, everybody knows a Bubba.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Was "Gump" your first experience with a Hollywood movie? 
</P>
<P>
 A: An HBO movie was a few years ago, based on my book "As Summers Die." It was 
one of Bette Davis' last movies. I worked some on the script. I went out to 
Hollywood and people there were fighting and growling. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: It wasn't a satisfying experience? 
</P>
<P>
 A: A movie is fun to work with to a point. But a time comes when you have to 
say no to what they are doing with your work, but writers don't always have a 
chance to do that. It's part of the game. Out there they talk about making a 
$50 movie which in their parlance means $50 million. They act nice to you but 
won't give up control.  
</P>
<P>
 My friend, the late writer Jim (James) Jones, was like God to me. When Jim 
first saw the screen version of his "The Thin Red Line," he was in Paris and 
went by himself. He started to hoot and holler at what had been done to his 
story, so loud they had to call for the gendarmes to throw old Jim out. 
</P>
<P>
 I have heard all of the stories about making movies in Hollywood and they all 
sunk in. Sunk in to my old lizard brain.

HARRY BELAFONTE'S BEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
Compiled by Carroll Lachnit 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Grammy-winning King of Calypso. Tony-winning Broadway star. The first black 
performer to win an Emmy award. Harry Belafonte has excelled in just about 
every medium. Here is a very selective list of his credits: Films 
</P>
<P>
 "Bright Road" (1953). Belafonte's film debut, in which he starred with Dorothy 
Dandridge in a tale of a teacher who helps a sensitive student.  
</P>
<P>
 "Carmen Jones" (1954). Belafonte starred as a soldier who falls for a 
temptress in this adaptation of Bizet's opera. He was again paired with 
Dandridge, but his singing voice, like that of the other stars, was dubbed. 
</P>
<P>
 "The World, the Flesh and the Devil" (1959). Starred in and co-produced this 
morality play set in post-apocalyptic New York. With Inger Stevens and Mel 
Ferrer.

 "King: A Filmed Record . . . Montgomery to Memphis" (1970). Belafonte appeared 
in this documentary about his friend Martin Luther King, Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 "Buck and the Preacher" (1972). A popular Western addition to Hollywood's 
cycle of 1970s black action films. Belafonte co-produced and starred as the 
flim-flamming phony preacher. Belafonte's best friend, Sidney Poitier, made his 
directorial debut with the film. 
</P>
<P>
 "Uptown Saturday Night" (1974). Starred as gangland boss, delivering a wicked 
imitation of former acting-workshop colleague Marlon Brando's wheezing 
"Godfather" voice. The film again teamed him with director Poitier. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Player" (1992). Belafonte did a cameo, as himself, in Robert Altman's 
star-filled Hollywood satire. Albums 
</P>
<P>
 "Calypso" (1956) Belafonte's third album established his reputation as the 
Calypso King and included "Jamaica Farewell" and "Banana Boat Song" ("Day-O") 
and stayed at No. 1 for 31 weeks.

<P>
 "Porgy and Bess" (1959). With Lena Horne.

Makeba" (1965). Both winners of best folk Grammys. 
</P>
<P>
 "Paradise in Gazankulu (1988). The album's lyrics and "township"-style songs 
honor the struggle of black people for equality in South Africa. Some tracks 
were clandestinely recorded in South Africa, where Belafonte's anti-apartheid 
stance made him persona non grata, and brought to the U.S., where the artist 
added his vocal lines. On Broadway 
</P>
<P>
 "John Murray Anderson's Almanac" (1953). Belafonte won a Tony award as best 
supporting actor in this musical revue. 
</P>
<P>
 "3 For Tonight" (1955). Starred in musical revue with Marge and Gower 
Champion.

A DARK 'SOUND OF MUSIC'? CHECK.; JAMES HAMMERSTEIN IS TAKING SOME OF THE 
SUGARCOATING OFF HIS FATHER'S MUSICAL -- 'I WANTED TO DOWNGRADE THE SENTIMENTAL 
SIDE.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II's final musical may not be known for 
its underbelly, but there's more to "The Sound of Music" than a singing 
governess and her brood. At least that's how director James Hammerstein sees 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 The son of the late lyricist believes the operetta based on the true story of 
the Von Trapp family singers is a tricky piece of work. "It's packed with 
emotional ammunition -- nuns, music, Nazis -- and they actually all happened," 
says Hammerstein, speaking by phone from New York. "The problem is not to 
appear to manipulate." 
</P>
<P>
 That's why the younger Hammerstein has tried to take a fresh approach to the 
popular standard that first bowed in 1959, with Mary Martin as Maria, and was 
made into a multiple Oscar-winning 1965 movie starring Julie Andrews. "I'm just 
trying to tell the story as honestly as I can and have the children bright, not 
cute," he says. "I wanted to downgrade the sentimental side. I darken it." 
</P>
<P>
 Hammerstein's touring production of "The Sound of Music," featuring Marie 
Osmond as Maria and Laurence Guittard as Capt. Von Trapp, arrives at the 
Pantages Theatre on Tuesday for a two-week run. It is presented by the Los 
Angeles Civic Light Opera. 
</P>
<P>
 The staging is a scaled-down adaptation of a production created five years ago 
for the New York City Opera that featured Debbie Boone in the lead role now 
played by Osmond. It's been on the road for nine months with the current cast, 
and has stopped in 35 cities across the United States so far. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a distinctly shady side to this tale of the convent girl who's sent 
to be a governess to a widower and his seven children. While none of Hitler's 
minions ever actually appear onstage, their presence is keenly felt as Maria 
and the family flee the Nazi invasion of Austria. 
</P>
<P>
 But Hammerstein, who is a veteran director who's frequently been associated 
with productions of his famous father's works, did not arrive at his 
interpretation overnight. "I didn't like it when I saw it the first time (when 
it first played Broadway)," he says, referring to the original 43-month New 
York run. "It seemed to me too sugarcoated, too full of cute children. I found 
it dull, too. They avoided any kind of sexual attraction." 
</P>
<P>
 Hammerstein never had a chance to discuss his opinion of the original staging 
with his father, who died just nine months after "The Sound of Music" opened. 
But he's confident that the senior Hammerstein would have approved of the 
direction in which he's now taking the musical. 
</P>
<P>
 "Politically, there's no doubt he would have approved," says the director. "He 
founded the Anti-Nazi League in California and he probably thought of (making 
it less sentimental) himself before me. And certainly if he didn't agree with 
it then, he would now. I always have the feeling that I knew my father better 
than anybody except my brother." 
</P>
<P>
 Hammerstein has not opted for an abstract style a la London and Broadway's 
currently popular revival of "Carousel." "This is representative, not an 
abstract interpretation," says the director, who has also staged London 
productions of "Oklahoma!," Lerner and Loewe's "My Fair Lady" and George 
Abbott's "Damn Yankees," and spent nine years as a director in residence at the 
Eugene O'Neill Theatre Festival. "I don't think 'The Sound of Music' goes well 
into an abstract interpretation like 'Carousel' does. It's too early for that." 
</P>
<P>
 What matters, says Hammerstein, is to keep the menace palpable. "The thing to 
do is to make people believe that this really happened," he says. "If you were 
to abstract it, then it would become a fairy story. 
</P>
<P>
 "These people embraced the Nazis for the most part. I can't forget this. I 
wish I could remind people a bit." 
</P>
<P>
 Specifically, Hammerstein relies on character to reveal the historical moment. 
"We've done something here that is not done often: I tried to hit the dark side 
of the family friend Max, the sophisticate among them and the one who rescues 
them from the Nazis," he says. "When somebody professes no political interest 
and suddenly has morality after all, that's worth investigating. Max is not 
just the guy who makes the jokes." 
</P>
<P>
 Y et the director knows he's got his work cut out for him, especially with 
younger theatergoers who may be hearing "The Sound of Music" for the first 
time. "I can sense a difference between those who remember (World War II and 
the Nazis) and those who don't," he says. "People who are young recognize the 
symbols, whereas those of us who are older get a kind of 'Oh, god.' Just the 
idea has that kind of power. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've all changed as an audience. I've changed. Thirty-five years is a long 
time. You just bring a different sensibility to it." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, even with its dark aspect brought out, "The Sound of Music" still 
has a hefty dose of optimism. "No matter how dark you make it, it's still a 
very uplifting story," says Hammerstein. "We've taken the time and gone as deep 
as we can, but I don't think you'll ever make this a turgid, deep psychological 
drama."* Vital Stats

THEATER NOTES; CROSSROADS LOOKING FOR DOLLAR SIGNS

 In January, Crossroads Nation al Arts Academy announced an upcoming spring 
season of shows at its Vision Theatre complex in Leimert Park. It sounded as if 
it might have been the most ambitious season of African American theater ever 
seen in L.A. 
</P>
<P>
 But spring came and went -- without the shows. 
</P>
<P>
 Crossroads executive director Avril Harris said the season was postponed until 
it could be better financed. Since then, Harris and Crossroads founder/"227" 
star Marla Gibbs have been pursuing financing nationwide. They hope to raise at 
least one-fourth of their $1-million budget before setting any further dates 
for the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Harris reports more success with out-of-state companies than with local firm 
and attributes that to the severity of California's economic problems. 
Out-of-state companies are looking for a way of tapping their logo into the 
consciousness of Californians, she said.

 SONDHEIMANIA: The first issue of the Sondheim Review, a new quarterly devoted 
to you-know-who, is out with 32 glossy pages of information, reviews and 
photos. 
</P>
<P>
 Included are detailed descriptions of the revisions made during the "Passion" 
previews, a list of 98 U.S. productions of Sondheim musicals this summer alone, 
and an article about the 1966 TV musical Sondheim wrote, "Evening Primrose." 
The composer himself submitted to an interview, and another article describes 
his appearance at a June 6 seminar sponsored by the Dramatists Guild and the 
Society of Stage Directors and Choreographers. 
</P>
<P>
 Sondheim told the seminar audience that the audience laughed at "20 places 
where we didn't want them to" during the first preview -- each one of which was 
changed. So don't expect the Tony-winning musical to be a laugh riot. "This is 
the first show I've written with no irony," Sondheim said. "The characters have 
no humor -- actually, Fosca (the show's obsessed lover) does. People say it 
breaks new ground. I say, 'Yes, as the world's first humorless musical.' " 
</P>
<P>
 While Sondheim told the seminar audience that "Passion" is "an opera in 
attitude," he told the Sondheim Review interviewer that "I don't much like 
opera because I like the contrast between the spoken word and the sung word. To 
me the spoken word is another kind of music." The underscoring may give the 
impression that "Passion" is more of a sung show than it is, he added. "In 
fact, the percentage of sung to spoken here is no different than 'Oklahoma!' 
or, you name it."

 WILL THIS IDEA FLY?: Get off an airplane at LAX, and what's your first 
impression of the city -- that it's a great theater town? That there are more 
professional stage productions here than in any other city in America? Hardly. 
But Barbara Bain wants to change that. 
</P>
<P>
 The actress -- who's probably best known for "Mission: Impossible" -- 
complained about the low profile of L.A. theater at LAX while addressing an 
audience of several hundred at the recent Audrey Skirball-Kenis theater 
conference. She suggested that those long corridors at the airport should be 
lined with posters promoting L.A.'s theatrical wares. 
</P>
<P>
 The next speaker at the conference lectern, KCRW radio moderator Warren Olney, 
said he'd ask Mayor Richard Riordan about this subject but jocularly added that 
if the mayor went along with the poster idea, "I'm sure they'd all have his 
picture on them." 
</P>
<P>
 A spokeswoman for the city Airport Department later told The Times that the 
rules are quite strict about prohibiting anything on the airport walls except 
directional information. But all such rules are under review because of the 
mayor's determination to generate more revenue at the airport. Of course not 
much revenue could be expected from nonprofit theater or from the sub-100-seat 
productions that make up the bulk of L.A.'s theatrical output. 
</P>
<P>
 But Adolfo V. Nodal, the city's cultural affairs general manager, said he 
thinks the idea has possibilities. "If not on the walls, maybe kiosks," he said 
-- or telephones that would offer free information about L.A.'s cultural 
events. "The airport is changing a lot," Nodal said, "and it's worth talking 
about."

 SAN JOSE BUILDING BOOM: The San Jose City Council has approved allocations of 
big bucks for that city's theaters. San Jose Repertory Theatre is getting a 
brand-new 500-seat home, to be built with $15.3 million of redevelopment money, 
while another $12.5 million of redevelopment funds will renovate the old Jose 
Theatre. The design of the latter theater is being tailored for El Teatro 
Campesino, although no business agreement has yet been signed between the city 
and Luis Valdez's company, which recently co-produced "Bandido!" at the Mark 
Taper Forum.

COMMENTARY; MONSTER CONCERT AFTERTHOUGHTS; THE EXPENSIVE MUSICAL EXPERIENCE OF 
VAN CLIBURN, A TRIVIAL-POPS PROGRAM AND THE THREE TENORS DID MORE FOR STAR 
CULTS THAN CULTURE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Martin Bernheimer, Martin Bernheimer is The Times' music critic. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Monster Concerts are over. The dust is beginning to resettle. The fallout 
is beginning to dwindle. Life, believe it or not, goes on. 
</P>
<P>
 You remember the Monster Concerts. They bludgeoned us in mid-July, irrational 
byproducts of our international soccer celebrations. They may have done little 
for culture as we thought we knew it, but they did a lot for star cults. 
</P>
<P>
 First there was the Van Cliburn semi-show at Hollywood Bowl. Top ticket: $250. 
The beloved pianist from Texas via Moscow was attempting a comeback marathon at 
Hollywood Bowl. Unfortunately, something happened during the intermission. 
Cliburn got either lightheaded or cold-footed -- it depends on who tells the 
tale. 
</P>
<P>
 In any case, he aborted the scheduled Rachmaninoff concerto, substituted four 
relatively easy solos and retreated apologetically. 
</P>
<P>
 His mysterious affliction apparently lingered on. After Los Angeles, he 
drastically simplified the agenda for the remaining Monster Concerts on his 
tour. 
</P>
<P>
 Next came a trivial-pops spectacular at our 18,000-seat amphitheater in 
Cahuenga Pass, a mishmash uniting John Williams, Nelson Riddle, Itzhak Perlman, 
Linda Ronstadt and the Los Angeles Philharmonic. Although the assembled 
disparities may have inspired aesthetic indigestion, hardly anyone complained. 
With the top ticket fetching $150, the public knew this concert just had to be 
good. Sure. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, there was the most monstrous event of all. Lights. Cameras. Hype. 
</P>
<P>
 The ghost of P.T. Barnum, who once sold the diva Jenny Lind to America in 
tandem with elegant elephants, hovered over Dodger Stadium. So did a blimp. The 
Three Tenors -- surely we don't have to name them -- were doing their 
hyper-florid thing for a ballpark audience of 53,000 (or 56,000, depending on 
whom you trust). Also for a television/video/radio/recording audience that, no 
doubt, will be tabulated in the zillions. Top ticket in the ravine rain forest: 
$1,012. 
</P>
<P>
 Driving from the Westside, your foolhardy reporter allowed only two hours to 
reach the tenorissimos. It wasn't enough. The freeways froze. When the shameful 
predicament was admitted in print, many readers proved less than forgiving. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, according to their letters (lots of letters), the tardy arrival 
(unprecedented in 29 years covering the beat) represented only the first of 
many critical sins. The others, in no particular order: failure to appreciate 
greatness, stupidity, arrogance, pomposity, pettiness, myopia, rudeness, 
unwillingness to "lighten up," stubborn refusal to serve as a cheerleader, and 
an idiotic expectation of quality under conditions that obviously precluded 
quality. 
</P>
<P>
 Silly me. Here I thought I was just doing my job. 
</P>
<P>
 If the majority of correspondents are right, a critic isn't supposed to 
describe and evaluate. A critic isn't supposed to report subjective reactions, 
hopefully supported by objective details. A critic isn't supposed to worry 
about what the composer wanted. A critic is supposed to sit back, relax, enjoy 
the ride -- no matter how bumpy -- and join the choir of push-button adulators. 
</P>
<P>
 It would have been easy to dismiss the sing-along tenor show as a low-calorie 
bagatelle, if the pretensions hadn't been so high. However, this patchwork 
program -- unevenly performed and grotesquely distorted via very loud 
loudspeakers -- was heralded as "the concert of the century." It probably was, 
moreover, the most costly concert of the century. Under such lofty conditions, 
the application of serious criteria seemed not just appropriate but essential. 
</P>
<P>
 T he management banished the press to seats about a mile to the side of the 
stage, 18 rows back. (The illustrated 6-inch-by-10-inch tickets were marked 
$1,000.) The singers resembled distant ants from the vantage point assigned. A 
visual crutch was offered by DiamondVision, but mouth-movement on the screen 
resisted synchronization with the music. Everything worked better on TV, 
despite the endless fund-raising pitches and gushing inanities of a miscast 
commentator, Itzhak Perlman. 
</P>
<P>
 The official mementos of this Monster Concert, soon to be released, no doubt 
will be even more successful. Clever hands can splice in passages from the 
numerous retakes that masqueraded as encores after the show officially ended. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, one awful suspicion lingers. The greatest-hit parade might have been 
just as effective, and less expensive, if the sights and sounds had been 
prerecorded. The anonymous guys on the stage could have come from Central 
Casting. The faces on the screen could have been on film. The voices could have 
emanated from a CD. 
</P>
<P>
 Apologists for the tenor circus -- one of the protagonists among them -- 
insist that such events create a new audience for opera. At least one pessimist 
fears that such events create little beyond a new audience for tenor circuses 
in general and for these tenors in particular. 
</P>
<P>
 The super-crowd at Dodger Stadium registered its pleasure at recognizing a 
tune by interrupting the music with applause. Never mind that the applause 
obliterated a not-so-high climax (conveniently transposed) or ruined the sacred 
strains of "Ave Maria." 
</P>
<P>
 A generation ago, similar throngs adored another tenor, a phony operatic hero 
named Mario Lanza. For some reason, those throngs never seemed to go near an 
opera house. The non-converts never heard Jussi Bjorling, Giuseppe di Stefano 
and Franco Corelli. They never heard Richard Tucker, Mario del Monaco and Carlo 
Bergonzi. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, those were tenors. They didn't pretend to be bigger than life. They 
didn't have a P.T. Barnum -- or a Tibor Rudas -- in their corner. They didn't 
trivialize their art. 
</P>
<P>
 And, of course, they didn't give Monster Concerts.

ART NOTES: PUTTING THE FAIR BACK INTO L.A. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 No sooner did ART/LA, Los Angeles' annual international art fair, collapse 
under the weight of the economy than a replacement rose on the horizon. 
</P>
<P>
 John Natsoulas, who owns a gallery in Davis and has organized several art 
conferences -- but never an art fair -- has announced plans for Art Los Angeles 
1994, the International Contemporary Art Fair of the West Coast. 
</P>
<P>
 The event is scheduled for Dec. 2-4 at Spartacus Square in Universal Studios. 
Natsoulas hopes to enlist 100 contemporary art dealers to display their wares. 
In addition, he plans to organize a concurrent Educational Conference on the 
Arts, including demonstrations and lectures by artists. 
</P>
<P>
 While his inexperience and the depressed art market may work against him, 
Natsoulas says he has an insider's energy and determination in his favor. But 
most important, he says, is that the cost of participating in the fair will be 
realistic in these days of gallery shrinkage. 
</P>
<P>
 "This fair will be affordable," he says. "I rented a booth last year at ART/LA 
for $25,000. The top price at this fair will be $9,000, and booths will be 
available for as low as $2,000, with $7,000 being about standard." The 
difference isn't that Universal Studios charges less for its space than the Los 
Angeles Convention Center, the home of ART/LA, according to Natsoulas. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't have a staff of 20 people. This will be a more efficient, cooperative 
thing. And it isn't about making money. The fair will benefit me in many ways. 
I don't have to make money on it. I'm fortunate in having a gallery in Davis, 
where my expenses are low," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 A veteran of 25 art fairs, Natsoulas believes the way to make a fair work in 
Los Angeles is for dealers and artists to get involved. As to why he is 
organizing the event in Southern California instead of closer to home: "People 
look to Los Angeles. It's in the forefront of art on the West Coast," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Natsoulas has no commitments from dealers but hopes to enlist an international 
array of participants. Unlike last year's ART/LA, his fair will focus 
exclusively on contemporary art. "Anything that's 30 years old, I don't want," 
he says. 
</P>
<P>
 All four galleries in the building at 170 S. La Brea Ave. -- Jan Baum, Neil 
Ovsey, Paul Kopeikin and Garth Clark -- are tentatively planning to participate 
in the new fair. They will probably rent adjacent spaces, according to Baum. 
"We like the idea for its simplicity and economy," she says, "and we thought it 
would be great to do the fair together, to reinforce the image of the 170 
building." 
</P>
<P>
 CAMDEN COMEBACK: In decades past, Camden Drive in Beverly Hills was the home 
of prestigious art showcases such as Paul Kantor, Frank Perls, P. N. Matisse 
and Charles Feingarten galleries. If two major New York galleries' plans 
materialize, the street will once again attract the art crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 Larry Gagosian, a high-profile contemporary art dealer who got his start in 
Los Angeles, plans to open a gallery at 456 N. Camden Drive, in the space 
formerly occupied by Salander-O'Reilly and Fred Hoffman Fine Arts. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Meier, architect of the J. Paul Getty Trust's new Getty Center in 
Brentwood, is designing Gagosian's 5,000-square-foot gallery. Meier's plans 
call for a new facade, a pyramid-shaped skylight and a loft for offices. The 
exhibition program will feature a few Los Angeles artists as well as blue-chip 
figures shown in Gagosian's Manhattan galleries, according to Hoffman, who will 
direct the new gallery. He's hoping for a December opening, but says a later 
date is more likely. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, a commercial space at the corner of Camden Drive and Wilshire 
Boulevard, formerly occupied by Gump's, is expected to be the home of a Beverly 
Hills branch of PaceWildenstein -- a powerhouse created in 1993 when 
Wildenstein & Co., a Paris-based dealer of Impressionist art, merged with Pace 
Gallery of New York, a major contemporary art dealership. An announcement of 
the new gallery's leadership and location is imminent, according to Marc 
Glimcher, PaceWildenstein's director of operations. 
</P>
<P>
 The gallery will have three directors, specializing in photography, 
contemporary art and Impressionism, he says. "The team method will work better 
for us than having one super-senior person. We expect to have a group of 
younger, charged-up people."*

PIAF, ARETHA AND . . . SHARA?; SHARA NELSON HAS BEEN HAILED IN HER NATIVE 
ENGLAND FOR HER AURA OF MELANCHOLY AND SOULFUL PURITY, BUT SHE STILL HARBORS 
DOUBTS ABOUT HER SINGING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Ernest Hardy, Ernest Hardy is a free-lance writer based in Los Angeles. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 English R&B newcomer Shara Nelson is being called the heiress to both France's 
Little Sparrow, Edith Piaf, and America's Queen of Soul, Aretha Franklin. Not 
bad for someone whose first album has been in U.S. stores for only a month. 
</P>
<P>
 Though Nelson, 30, doesn't really sound like a Memorex copy of either musical 
icon, their emotional essence reverberates strongly in her lyrics and voice. 
</P>
<P>
 From Piaf, Nelson's music borrows an aura of melancholy that shades even 
optimistic lyrics with sadness or foreboding. Like Franklin, she evokes a 
soulful purity that gives even the most banal detail an honest ring. And she 
can swing almost effortlessly from defiance to heartache. 
</P>
<P>
 In real life, it's the vulnerable side that seems to win out. 
</P>
<P>
 Sitting by the pool of a West Hollywood hotel, Nelson shifts uncomfortably 
when asked about her voice. 
</P>
<P>
 "To this day, there is a part of me that is doubtful about it," she says 
softly, picking absent-mindedly at a warm fruit salad. "The thing I always felt 
strongest about was my writing. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't until I was 13 or 14 and was in the studio with the people from 
(early rap group) Sugarhill Gang that I actually gave my voice some serious 
consideration. They were so flattering, I thought there might be something 
there." 
</P>
<P>
 Though the song she recorded that day was never released, she so enjoyed the 
process of making music that it became a defining moment in her life. Producer 
Adrian Sherwood, a family friend who'd brought Nelson into the studio with the 
Sugarhill Gang alumni, became one of her biggest supporters. 
</P>
<P>
 Nelson's songwriting efforts continued throughout her teen years, even as 
singing was placed on the back burner. She studied languages in college, 
majoring in French, but didn't really exert herself in her studies because she 
knew that eventually she'd get back where her heart was: singing. 
</P>
<P>
 Her musical breakthrough came in the mid-'80s when she hooked up with the 
musicians who would eventually form Massive Attack, the highly regarded 
experimental dance-music outfit whose 1991 debut album is considered a landmark 
in the genre. Titled "Blue Lines," it featured her vocals and three songs she 
co-wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time Nelson released her solo album last year in England, she'd become 
something of a cult figure. The album, "What Silence Knows" (see review, Page 
59) , led to nominations for best new artist and best female artist in the Brit 
Awards competition (the English equivalent of the Grammys). 
</P>
<P>
 Larry Flick, dance music editor for Billboard magazine, predicts she'll be 
equally hailed in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "Shara's album is going to blow people away," he says. "It's mature, it's 
intelligent, it's full of soul and emotion. It's one of the best R&B records in 
years." 
</P>
<P>
 When asked about all the praise that she has received, she's both embarrassed 
and blunt. "I'm not too worried about the fate of this record in the States. I 
know it's not the type of thing that will happen automatically over here. I 
know it will take time for people to see it as I see it. I did the album with 
everything I had in me, and I couldn't dilute it or change it to make it appeal 
to people who don't want it." 
</P>
<P>
 B orn in London to parents who were originally from Kingston, Jamaica, Nelson 
was surrounded by music while growing up. No one else in the family sang or 
played an instrument, but she spent hours listening to her father's old jazz 
and R&B records. Aretha Franklin emerged as her idol.  
</P>
<P>
 By 13, Nelson was already writing songs and singing in the church choir. 
Though she had more faith in her compositions than her voice, she really wanted 
to be a singer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew I'd be a singer as a child," the soft-spoken Nelson says sitting up in 
her poolside chair and raising her voice to compete with nearby businessmen on 
portable phones. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was lucky enough to hear different types of music from everywhere, and I 
think that's what did it. Being able to see how music touched everyone, no 
matter where they were or what differences otherwise separated them. That did 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 It was while at college that she was introduced to Nellee Hooper, the record 
producer who created the hypnotic grooves in the late '80s for such Soul II 
Soul hits as "Back to Life" and "Keep On Movin'." 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, Hooper was working with the influential, experimental dance music 
outfit the Wild Bunch, and he quickly brought Nelson on board. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wild Bunch went on to become Massive Attack, a loosely structured 
collective that is considered by many dance-music aficionados to be one of the 
most important forces in the genre in the last 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "My role was to write songs around drum beats," recalls Nelson. "We spent most 
of our time in Bristol, where the guys were from, and there were all kinds of 
fusions going on at the time. We were very influenced by what was going on, the 
experimentation that was just the norm." 
</P>
<P>
 Massive Attack dissolved under internal strains, and Nelson spent the next two 
years writing songs and trying to figure out her next step. She signed a 
publishing deal with the idea of writing songs for others, but people began to 
encourage her to record the songs herself. 
</P>
<P>
 Eager for creative control, she signed with the small, respected Cooltempo 
label. "I didn't want to get locked in a great, big corporate machine that 
didn't understand what I was doing," she says. "Cooltempo is small, but they've 
got big machinery behind them (distribution by giant EMI), so I thought it was 
the most sensible thing to do." 
</P>
<P>
 "What Silence Knows," her debut album on Chrysalis/ERG, is a sophisticated, 
mature work. It dips into soul music archives for a classic Motown vibe that it 
gently, knowingly tweaks with a mixture of wariness and desperate, diminishing 
hope. It knows the potency of cheap (i.e., pop) music, and uses it to explore 
real, often dark emotions. 
</P>
<P>
 Nelson is already working on her second album, which she promises will be 
quite different. A self-described workaholic, she says her hobbies are reading 
and writing, both of which ultimately serve her work. She hasn't performed live 
in years and says she won't until she feels all the elements are in place. 
</P>
<P>
 When asked if there is an overriding theme to her work, she pauses a moment 
and then says, "Just getting through the world in your own way and not feeling 
like you have to be the same as everybody else. I think that as an adolescent 
or as a child, you feel you've got to be like everyone else, and you'd think 
adulthood would change all that. But it doesn't. It's still confusing."*

CD SPOTLIGHT; SINGING A SOULFUL 'ADIOS'

 *** 1/2; VARIOUS ARTISTS; "Adios Amigo: A Tribute to Arthur Alexander", Razor 
& Tie  
</P>
<P>
 In the flood of tribute compilations, this is a standout -- the first 
indication being the distinguished artists who have contributed versions of 
songs by Arthur Alexander. He's the late R&B singer-songwriter best known for 
his "Anna" (recorded by the Beatles) and "You Better Move On" (the Rolling 
Stones).Among those on board: Frank Black, Elvis Costello, Chuck Jackson, Mark 
Knopfler (on guitar), Graham Parker, Robert Plant and John Prine. 
</P>
<P>
 But the album's chief revelation is the emotional purity of Alexander's songs, 
mostly soulful ballads with a country tinge and heart-stirring sentimentality. 
A gem. 
</P>
<P>
 New albums are rated on a scale of one star (poor), two stars (fair), three 
stars (good) and four stars (excellent).

EVERYBODY'S TALKING; WHAT A 'WILD' COUPLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When musicians of contrasting sensibilities team up in the studio, it's 
anyone's guess whether the results will sizzle or fizzle. 
</P>
<P>
 Heartland rocker John Mellencamp may have been taking a gamble when he asked 
funk artist Me'shell NdegeOcello to play and sing with him on a version of Van 
Morrison's "Wild Night," but he's delighted with the results. The single, which 
was released May 9, also appears on Mellencamp's new "Dance Naked" album and is 
currently in the Top 10 on the national pop chart. 
</P>
<P>
 Mellencamp got the idea for the surprise teaming after hearing NdegeOcello's 
acclaimed debut album, "Plantation Lullabies," which was released last year by 
Madonna's Maverick Records. 
</P>
<P>
 "I liked what she did," Mellencamp explains. "I thought she was the real 
item." 
</P>
<P>
 NdegeOcello, whose "If That Was Your Boyfriend (He Wasn't Last Night)" is 
another of the most-talked-about singles of 1994, turned out to be a big 
Mellencamp fan and agreed to team up with him. 
</P>
<P>
 The original idea was for her to just add some powerful bass licks to "Wild 
Night" and one other album track, "The Big Jack." But Mellencamp decided he 
wanted a second voice on "Wild Night," which he had been doing off and on in 
concert for years. Since his longtime backup vocalist and fiddle player Lisa 
Germano wasn't at the session, NdegeOcello was called into service. The pairing 
clicked and the song was completed in two takes. 
</P>
<P>
 NdegeOcello, who performed "Wild Night" with Mellencamp at the MTV Movie 
Awards in June, has a standing invitation to join him on stage when her 
schedule coincides with his tour (which includes Sept. 13 and 14 shows at the 
Greek Theatre and a Sept. 16 date at the Glen Helen Blockbuster Pavilion). She 
planned to do so during a recent show at Tipitina's in New Orleans, but was 
sidelined by a strep throat.*

 What a difference 25 years makes with the media. 
</P>
<P>
 The press got caught short by the original Woodstock festival in 1969.Who knew 
it was going to be a cultural landmark? 
</P>
<P>
 "None of the other writers wanted to go," recalls Atlantic Records President 
Danny Goldberg, who was assigned to the rock festival as a 19-year-old cub 
reporter for Billboard magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was excited to go, but the regular reviewers were into going to the 
Copacabana (nightclub) and getting free drinks." 
</P>
<P>
 Things will be slightly different at next weekend's 25th-anniversary event. 
This time around, the TV, print and radio corps will number a staggering 1,100 
persons. That's nearly 40 newshounds for each act on the two-day bill. 
</P>
<P>
 And the total could have been four times that number. 
</P>
<P>
 Hayley Sumner, a press coordinator for the event, said that more than 3,000 
credential applications were turned down because of space limitations. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've worked Live Aid, Paul Simon's big concerts in Central Park and even 
Howard Stern," says Sumner, who works for Dan Klores Associates, "but I've 
never seen a turnout like this." 
</P>
<P>
 If this saturation coverage rubs you the wrong way, don't feel alone. Neil 
Young, who played the '69 festival, is so turned off by the corporate ethos of 
the anniversary concert that he's designed "Wood 
</P>
<P>
 ock" hats featuring a vulture posed on a guitar neck. Steve Hochman

 With the soundtrack album from "The Lion King" dominating the pop album 
charts, Walt Disney Records is preparing another collection of music related to 
the movie. "Rhythm of the Pridelands," due in October, will feature South 
African vocalist-arranger Lebo M. -- it's his voice at the beginning of the 
song "Circle of Life." There are no new tracks from the Elton John-Tim Rice 
team, but there will be a version of one of the film's biggest crowd-pleasers: 
"The Lion Sleeps Tonight," which was left off the soundtrack album. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Vanessa Williams, a hit on Broadway in "Kiss of the Spider Woman," returns 
with a new album in late November. . . . The word from the Prince camp is that 
he'll probably tour the U.S. late this year. Expect an announcement within two 
weeks. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Former Red Hot Chili Peppers guitarist John Frusciante, who left the group 
shortly before the 1992 "Lollapalooza" tour, has a solo album due Oct. 18 from 
American Records, whose chief, Rick Rubin, produces the Peppers. Frusciante's 
set is described as "very dark." . . . American is also set to release its 
first from veteran English alternative-rockers Love and Rockets. But the album, 
"Hot Trip to Heaven," offers a different sound from the trio: a collection of 
ambient pieces. A more rock-oriented album is scheduled for February, with a 
tour to follow. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Former Rip magazine editor Lonn Friend took just seven days in his new job as 
an Arista Records executive to sign his first band -- and not a group of 
metalheads as you'd expect. Friend inked the Bogmen, a young, Long Island-based 
band that's built up a sizable East Coast following through heavy touring. 
Friend says the group's music reminds him a little of early Talking Heads. A 
debut album is planned for next spring or summer. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Soul singer Percy Sledge -- of "When a Man Loves a Woman" fame -- has finished 
his first album in years, with guests including guitarist Steve Cropper, 
ex-Rolling Stone Mick Taylor, fellow soul man Bobby Womack and 
singer-songwriter Carla Olson. The album was produced by Saul Davis and Barry 
Goldberg, with liner notes written by veteran producer Jerry Wexler. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Naughty by Nature hopes to have the album they've been working on finished in 
time for late fall release. But the label says there's a good chance it won't 
be ready until next year. . . . R&B singer Karyn White's next album is due in 
late September. Her husband, Terry Lewis, and his partner Jimmy Jam, are among 
the producers.*

PRIVATE LIVES; THEME PARKS; SUMMER'S STAND-INS: HOT RIDES

 Go. And stay. That's the lure of the "motion-based simulator" attractions that 
are drawing crowds at theme parks this summer. But from Valencia to Anaheim, 
it's still popular to loop and swoop the old-fashioned way -- on a speeding 
roller coaster. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's a rundown of what's in vogue this summer, compared to what was hot a 
year ago: 
</P>
<P>
 Knott's Berry Farm, Buena Park. The top ride is the new Mystery Lodge. The 
"advanced technology theater" creates the illusion of motion and has a Native 
American theme. No. 2 is Bigfoot Rapids, where riders are drenched with water. 
Boomerang, No. 3, takes riders upside down six times in less than a minute. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year's top three: The "Jurassic Park" dinosaur craze boosted Kingdom of 
the Dinosaurs to the No. 1 spot. Bigfoot Rapids and Boomerang were No. 2 and 3. 
</P>
<P>
 Six Flags Magic Mountain, Valencia. The park's new Batman: The Ride, swooped 
into the No. 1 spot. Riders are suspended from the track, their feet flapping 
in the wind. Viper, which the park bills as the world's largest looping roller 
coaster, is No. 2. At No. 3 is Colossus, the park's huge wooden roller coaster. 
Last summer's lineup: Viper, Colossus and Ninja, a suspended roller coaster. 
</P>
<P>
 Universal Studios Hollywood, Universal City. No. 1 is Back to the Future, a 
motion-based simulator that sends riders careening through time. Earthquake: 
The Big One is No. 2. Visitors experience an 8.3 earthquake. In third place: 
Backdraft re-creates the movie's final conflagration. The rides' popularity 
ranking is unchanged from last summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Disneyland, Anaheim. The park has no stats on this summer's top rides. But the 
park says its Lion King Celebration parade is packing them in. Last summer, No. 
1 was a surprise: the low-tech Disneyland Railroad. No. 2 was Pirates of the 
Carribean. No. 3 was Space Mountain.*

PRIVATE LIVES; VIDEODROME; INVITING 'SCHINDLER' HOME; HOW TO MARKET STEVEN 
SPIELBERG'S OSCAR-WINNING HOLOCAUST MOVIE, 'SCHINDLER'S LIST'? IT'S ALL THERE 
-- NO CUTS, NO NEW SCENES -- IN BLACK AND WHITE.

 When "Schindler's List" comes to home video on Aug. 17, it won't be 
accompanied by the array of never-before-seen sequences and behind-the-scenes 
glimpses that have become part of many "event" video releases. After all, how 
do you improve upon what many consider to be perfection? 
</P>
<P>
 "When a movie has won this many awards and has been shown the respect and 
honor that this has," observes Andrew Kairey, senior vice president of 
marketing and sales for MCA/Universal Home Video, "it's kind of hard to go back 
to it and say, 'I want to make it better.' " 
</P>
<P>
 "Schindler's List," Steven Spielberg's sobering, resonant epic of Nazi war 
profiteer Oskar Schindler and his most unexpected act of heroism -- rescuing 
1,100 Jews from certain death in Nazi concentration camps -- won seven Academy 
Awards, including best picture and best director, and was named best picture of 
1993 by every major critics group as well as the Golden Globes and the British 
Academy Awards. Beyond the accolades, it offered definitive proof that 
Spielberg, the acknowledged master of popcorn movies, was likewise capable of 
tackling difficult adult material -- his previous efforts in that arena had 
always been considered compromised or flawed in some fashion. 
</P>
<P>
 I t was also a proud moment for the film industry in general, as Universal 
proved that a film examining such a delicate subject could be made, marketed 
and distributed with remarkable sensitivity and without "Hollywooding" it up. 
</P>
<P>
 Which is not to say that "Schindler" won't find its way to video without some 
hoopla. A special collector's edition, retailing for $139.98, will include a 
letter from Spielberg, an exclusive pictorial book of photos from the 
production, a copy of Thomas Keneally's original novel and a special-edition 
compact disc of John Williams' Oscar-winning soundtrack, packaged in a 
coffee-table-style linen slipcase. Each set will be individually numbered, up 
to 100,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Otherwise, "Schindler" will be priced for rental rather than ownership, 
although Kairey expects some video stores will offer the double-cassette 
package for sale for just under $100. Rental copies of the film will be 
available in both letterboxed and full-frame versions; the collector's edition 
will come only in a letterboxed version. 
</P>
<P>
 Spielberg and Oscar-winning director of photography Janusz Kaminski spent a 
month on the film-to-video transfer to ensure that the 3-hour, 17-minute film 
looks as vivid on video as it did in theaters. There were no technical glitches 
in the video transfer of the sort endured during the theatrical release, which 
found some projectionists around the country inexperienced in dealing with the 
thinner black-and-white celluloid. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's much easier to intercut black-and-white and color footage on videotape 
than it is in theaters," says Mike Fitzgerald of MCA/Universal Home Video, who 
helped oversee the video transfer of the film with Spielberg and Kaminski. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, it's no picnic: "You have to time and grade the film in a 
scene-by-scene process to check that the density of the dark and light spots of 
the image are the same as on the original answer print. At every cut, you take 
time out to make sure the transfer resembles the answer print, and then you go 
on." 
</P>
<P>
 Since its release last Christmas, "Schindler's List" has grossed about $96 
million in the United States and more than $300 million worldwide. Even after 
the video release, the film will remain in limited theatrical release, Kairey 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no emphasis to get it to $100 million," he said, "but we want to 
expose it to as many people as possible, and there are still schools and civic 
groups who ask us to set up screenings in theaters." 
</P>
<P>
 A dvertising for the video re lease, which began Aug. 1, positions the film as 
a "must-see event" to be viewed with other family members, Kairey said. After 
the release, TV commercials focusing on the collector's edition will be added 
to the mix. Kairey added that print advertising will be expanded beyond the 
usual sources and entertainment and performing-arts publications to include 
such special-interest outlets as Jewish newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
 Laser disc versions of the film will be released Sept. 21, with the Limited 
Collector's Edition also retailing for $139.98 and the regular edition for 
$49.98. Both of these will be letterboxed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Steven Spielberg has been involved in every aspect of the video release," 
Kairey said. "Whether he will add footage in a special release down the road is 
a decision he has to make."*

ALASKA BEAR CENSUS ALTERED TO ACCOMMODATE CULTURAL DIVERSITY; CONSERVATION: 
NATIVES' OBJECTIONS FORCED THE GOVERNMENT TO SCALE BACK THE STUDY AND LOOK FOR 
WAYS TO ALLEVIATE THEIR CONCERNS. THEY DEMAND THAT THE ANIMALS BE RESPECTED AND 
OPPOSE CONCEPT OF 'HARVESTING.'

 Native resistance to a government-funded brown bear census in the Kwethluk 
Mountains has prompted officials to scale back while a consultant to villagers 
comes up with other approaches. 
</P>
<P>
 Disagreement over the study, overseen by the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service, has 
renewed interest in "cooperative management" -- a hybrid technique that 
incorporates both science and natives' observations. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are inventing a new system," said Charles Jonkel, a Montana-based 
biologist and an adviser to the Assn. of Village Council Presidents. "Some 
mistakes are inevitable." 
</P>
<P>
 The survey began last year after subsistence bear hunting rules were 
liberalized at the request of southwest Alaska natives. They objected to rules 
limiting subsistence hunters to one brown bear apiece every four years. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal managers in 1991 lengthened the subsistence season and increased each 
hunter's limit to one bear a year. But because there were no good estimates of 
the bears' numbers -- and no forecasts on how increased hunting might alter the 
population -- liberalized rules were tied to the census. 
</P>
<P>
 The study, scheduled to run through 1999, concentrates on a 1,000-square-mile 
tract, a small patch of the 26-million-acre Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta refuge. 
Experts say 90 or so bears range over the study tract. 
</P>
<P>
 Goals called for 30 bears to be fitted with radio collars in 1993, increasing 
to 45 bears in 1994. But biologists who recently completed radio-collaring 
bears wound up adding just nine more to the study after native Alaskans 
appealed to various state and federal agencies, and Fish & Wildlife managers in 
Washington ordered a reduced effort. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously we're disappointed," said Walt Stieglitz, regional Fish & Wildlife 
Service director in Anchorage. "The first choice of game managers is to know 
what the population level is and know what the trends are." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials say rather than reduce the survey's impact, cutting back on the 
number of bears collared this year could lengthen the census because it would 
take longer to collect valid data. Radio collars send round-the-clock signals 
so that a bear's travels and life cycle can be monitored. 
</P>
<P>
 Subsistence hunters killed 28 bears in the region last year and sports hunters 
took two, records show. Some villagers say liberalized hunts won't lead to more 
subsistence kills, since regulations have only legalized a routine practice 
without apparent declines in the number of bears. 
</P>
<P>
 In Bethel, lawyer John Starkey said natives sought to change regulations that 
required hunters to deliver bear skulls to wildlife managers for tagging. 
</P>
<P>
 Starkey said the native Yupik Eskimos believe that practice is disrespectful 
to bears. 
</P>
<P>
 Villagers raised the same complaints over outfitting bears with radio collars. 
They also worried about eating meat from bears that had been tranquilized with 
the chemical that anesthetizes bears for the 30 minutes or so it takes to 
attach a radio collar and complete other tasks to mark an animal for study. 
</P>
<P>
 Game managers say the drug leaves a bear's system in 48 hours and cannot enter 
the food chain. They say radio-tracking is a widely used technique that 
produces reliable data. 
</P>
<P>
 But Stieglitz says that those worries show his service could have done a 
better job of explaining itself. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, eliciting support from native groups and adding their signatures 
to the study agreement would have been a step toward cooperative management, he 
said. The agreement is signed by the service and the state Department of Fish 
and Game. 
</P>
<P>
 Cooperation has worked for Fish & Wildlife projects elsewhere, notably in the 
Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta goose management plan and in the Kilbuck caribou plan in 
southwest Alaska. Both are supported by native Alaskans. 
</P>
<P>
 Dave Stearns, Fish & Wildlife Service manager for the Yukon-Kuskowkim Delta 
refuge, said he was considering daylong briefings in the villages to explain 
how the agency planned to manage bears. 
</P>
<P>
 Stieglitz said there's no deadline for suggestions from Jonkel, the natives' 
consultant, although plans for next year will get under way soon. Alternatives 
to radio collars suggested so far include possible DNA tracking and use of 
cameras to count and track bears, as well as field trips with area residents. 
</P>
<P>
 "But to get a fix on a population, you have to know what's happening in the 
total sense, not just a portion of the population," Stieglitz said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no way you can do that running around on the ground in a snow machine 
or ATV (all terrain vehicle). That's not putting anyone down; that's just a 
fact of life." 
</P>
<P>
 Starkey, who represented the Village Council Presidents in an unsuccessful 
lawsuit to stop the bear census, said the survey is a hard sell. Villagers have 
traditionally reserved bear hunting for an elite few; the natives believe their 
hunting grounds have been violated, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The common term you hear (in game management) is 'harvest' -- the idea that 
people grow the animals and harvest them," Starkey said. 
</P>
<P>
 "But Yupiks believe animals present themselves to be captured. How you treat 
them will determine future success in hunting and the animals' success in 
repopulating." 
</P>
<P>
 Jonkel, who said he came to Alaska in May to try to defuse hard feelings, said 
there's nothing technically wrong with the bear study. 
</P>
<P>
 "But if the local people don't want it, you have to look for other ways," he 
said, including less intrusive studies such as examining bear tracks or 
excrement. 
</P>
<P>
 "My job was getting people to slow down and back up and learn how to talk to 
one another," said Jonkel, who favors what he calls a "sitting and whittling" 
approach that would have authorities spend time getting to know villagers 
before discussing touchy issues such as access to game. 
</P>
<P>
 Traditional wildlife management has been wed to the tables and charts of 
biologists, an approach that Jonkel said has best served the sport hunter. 
</P>
<P>
 "But now we're trying to add in the values of artists and poets and native 
peoples," Jonkel said. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're mixing hard data and hard science with cultural values and opinions 
and the observations of elders. The book hasn't been written yet on how to do 
that."

ROCK STAR BILLY IDOL RELEASED AFTER 'POSSIBLE OVERDOSE' HOSPITALIZES HIM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bad boy rocker Billy Idol was released from a hospital Saturday after 
treatment overnight for a possible drug overdose, his publicist said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe it was a drug overdose," Idol's publicist, Ellen Zoe Golden, said 
Saturday."But I don't have any specific details." 
</P>
<P>
 Idol, 38, headed to an undisclosed Southern California location to rest, 
Golden said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's fine now. He's with family and friends and just relaxing," she said. 
"All indications for a recovery are favorable." 
</P>
<P>
 Fire Department spokesmen said paramedics responded to a call reporting a 
"possible overdose" at Idol's Hollywood Hills home Friday night and transported 
the patient to St. Joseph Medical Center in Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
 Idol was also rushed to a hospital in January when he collapsed in convulsions 
outside the Beverly Hills club Tatou. At that time, his manager attributed the 
collapse to exhaustion. But other people close to Idol said it was a result of 
taking a once-legal steroid substitute known as GHB. 
</P>
<P>
 The veteran rocker with the sexy sneer and punk rebel image became one of the 
first MTV generation pop heroes in the 1980s. But his career had slowed 
somewhat recently.

TROUBLE COMES TO RIVER CITY -- BACTERIA; ARIZONA: COLIFORM CONTAMINANT FOUND 
UNDER LONDON BRIDGE IS HURTING BUSINESS AT LAKE HAVASU. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM F. RAWSON, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 From water-skiing college kids to retirees in houseboats, tourists flock to 
this desert oasis, lured by its sparkling lake and the incongruous sight of the 
London Bridge rising from the Arizona desert. 
</P>
<P>
 But there is trouble in this Colorado River city. High levels of coliform 
bacteria in the channel beneath the British bridge have closed two of the 
lake's busiest beaches for almost a month, and news of the mysterious 
contamination is keeping tourists away. 
</P>
<P>
 One recent Friday evening, almost no one strolled through the English Village, 
a collection of small shops, restaurants and other businesses located in the 
shadow of London Bridge, which was dismantled and transported block-by-block to 
the desert, where it reopened in 1971. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Only a fraction of the normal boat traffic stirred the lake, which draws 
people from both coasts. 
</P>
<P>
 "Normally there should be at least 100 people walking around here," said Jesse 
Maheu, who rents ski jets from a small lakeside shop. "I didn't have a single 
ski go out today." 
</P>
<P>
 The problem was discovered prior to the July 4th weekend, according to John 
Parrot, head of the Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
 Coliform bacteria indicate the possible presence of animal and human waste as 
well as other disease-carrying organisms. 
</P>
<P>
 Gov. Fife Symington and Mayor Richard Hileman have declared public health 
emergencies, and the state has allocated more than $125,000 to find and 
eliminate the contamination's source. 
</P>
<P>
 The bacteria were found in the narrow channel dredged to create a small 
island, where most of the tourist businesses and major beaches are located. The 
cause of the contamination remains unknown despite a monthlong search, said Ed 
Fox, director of the state Department of Environmental Quality. 
</P>
<P>
 Fox named several possible factors, however, including sluggish water flow, 
water temperatures near 90 degrees, septic tanks, malfunctioning sewage 
systems, storm sewers and illegal dumping from boats. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The environmental agency has hired a consultant and employed dozens of field 
inspectors, police divers and a Department of Public Safety helicopter. 
</P>
<P>
 The helicopter is equipped with an infrared detection scope that can spot 
discharges of warm sewage water. 
</P>
<P>
 As the search continues, the summer tourism season is slipping away. Parrot 
had no firm figures but said he'd been told that business is off by 50% and 
more compared to last summer. 
</P>
<P>
 "What is really killing us is reports of things like sewage washing up on the 
beach, stuff like that," Parrot said. "They're just not true." 
</P>
<P>
 The few tourists out in the late-afternoon heat recently said they weren't 
especially concerned about the condition of the beaches. 
</P>
<P>
 "I heard about the beaches, but we're not going to be boating or swimming so 
it doesn't bother us," said John Oliver, visiting from Haymarket, Va., with his 
wife and grandson.

HORSES DYING OF THIRST ON MILITARY LAND; NATURE: OFFICIALS AT THE WHITE SANDS 
BASE SAY THE WILD HERD IS TOO LARGE. WATER IS BEING GIVEN THE ANIMALS; SOME 
WILL BE SOLD TO REDUCE THE POPULATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The decaying body of a foal bleaches in the hot desert sand, yards from the 
water troughs that are filled daily. The severed, skeletal leg of another horse 
lies nearby. Vultures flap overhead. 
</P>
<P>
 Wild horses are dying on this 3,200-square-mile military reservation, victims 
of overgrazing and a vicious dry spell. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got a huge problem," White Sands spokesman Larry Furrow said. 
</P>
<P>
 The first 20 bodies were discovered July 6. Two days later, 104 horses were 
dead, some of starvation, others shot by military officials anxious to end 
their misery. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at the Army missile range in southern New Mexico estimate that White 
Sands has about 1,400 feral horses -- descendants of those living on the land 
when the government took it over in 1945. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Three of the four major herds seem to have adequate food and water, but the 
Mound Springs herd, which numbered about 400 before the recent deaths, has 
overgrazed its land and finds itself facing barren ground and starvation. 
</P>
<P>
 Rainfall for the year is 20% below normal, and temperatures have topped 100 
degrees for 20 straight days. 
</P>
<P>
 The military has begun filling water troughs daily. Officials hope the water 
will give the horses enough strength to move on to better grazing elsewhere on 
the range. 
</P>
<P>
 Once the horses regain their health, many will likely be sold at auction to 
help trim the population to a manageable level. The roundups probably won't 
begin until the fall, and some don't look like they'll make it. 
</P>
<P>
 At a watering hole about 75 miles north of range headquarters, a handful of 
horses edged toward six water troughs one recent day, their ribs protruding and 
their flanks emaciated. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody hates this more than the people here at the range," Furrow said. 
</P>
<P>
 The crisis has brought offers of aid from around the country. Karen Sussman, 
president of the nonprofit International Society for the Protection of Mustangs 
and Burros in Scottsdale, Ariz., said the response has been tremendous. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a person in Colorado who has the capacity to haul in one ton of hay," 
Sussman said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Army won't provide food. Officials say the horses are fiercely 
territorial and food might keep them from leaving the stricken area. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if the drought ends and summer rainfall greens up the rangeland, problems 
could persist. The range can support only about 300 to 500 horses, which would 
mean trimming the population by two-thirds, Furrow said. 
</P>
<P>
 The military attempted to do that in 1989 but abandoned the effort. Some 
attribute that to protests by animal-rights activists who feared the horses 
would wind up in slaughterhouses. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, range officials won't be deterred. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a growing problem," Furrow said. "If we don't fix it now, it will 
never be fixed."

REDUCED LOGGING A SIDELIGHT OF SPILL; ALASKA: RESTORATION FUND HAS MADE HABITAT 
PROTECTION A PRIORITY, PURCHASING THOUSANDS OF ACRES OF LAND AND MILLIONS IN 
TIMBER RIGHTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID FOSTER, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Environmental activists relish the irony: The disaster that fouled Alaska's 
coast with oil in 1989 is now saving parts of it from logging. 
</P>
<P>
 To compensate the government for oil damages to natural resources, Exxon Corp. 
agreed in 1991 to pay $900 million into a restoration fund. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, the fund's state and federal trustees have made habitat protection 
a priority. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, they bought 42,000 acres of private land near Kodiak Island to 
create the new Afognak Island State Park. They also purchased $7.5 million of 
private inholdings in an existing state park on the Kenai Peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
 In May, the trustees bought $2 million in timber rights from an Alaska Native 
corporation preparing to log 2,000 acres of evergreen forest on the shores of 
Prince William Sound. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of the deal, Eyak Corp. suspended logging plans for 60,000 acres so 
the trustees could negotiate to buy more timber rights. 
</P>
<P>
 All this pleases environmentalists, who have lobbied for years to preserve the 
forested islands of Prince William Sound and Alaska's southeastern panhandle. 
</P>
<P>
 But not everyone is happy. Some commercial fishermen say research into the oil 
spill's long-term ecological impacts was shortchanged by trustees' emphasis on 
habitat protection. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the $340 million spent or budgeted so far, $43 million has gone toward 
habitat protection and $17 million toward research and monitoring. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Other Alaskans say discouraging timber harvests is no way to help coastal 
communities recover economically from the oil spill. 
</P>
<P>
 Still others don't want more Alaska land "locked up" in parks. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're using the oil spill as an excuse to acquire these lands," said Steve 
Ward, a hunter and fisherman in Chenega Bay. "They have no intention of using 
them, but they're going to stop us from using them." 
</P>
<P>
 For her part, Sue Libenson of the Alaska Rainforest Campaign sees habitat 
protection as one of the few useful things done since 1989 to address the 
damage left by the wreck of the Exxon Valdez. 
</P>
<P>
 "The oil spill is a done deal, from an environmental point of view," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The forest is the real issue of the moment. We'll be able to look back, 30 
years from now, and say that at least we didn't log these areas -- at least the 
public got something out of it."'

SPORTS IS ABOUT ENTERTAINMENT, WINNING, NOT A STADIUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * It is apparent from reading the various reports related to the Anaheim 
Stadium renovation that the community's enthusiasm for the teams has clouded 
the thinking of otherwise rational individuals. Prior to the commitment of any 
public funds, careful analysis needs to occur to determine what value the 
community is receiving for its money. 
</P>
<P>
 The underlying premise for such new or remodeled facilities is that structural 
amenities affect the success of a sports franchise. Sports is about 
entertainment and winning, not amenities. A successful sports franchise begins 
with ownership committed to winning and some understanding of how to translate 
that commitment into W's. The San Francisco 49ers won four Super Bowls in what 
is generally acknowledged as the worst multi-sports facility in the United 
States -- Candlestick Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County has been getting the short end of the sports stick. The Los 
Angeles Rams have shown little interest in Orange County and, worse, an 
unwillingness or inability to field a winning team. The California Angels claim 
poverty: that The Cowboy's saddlebags are getting light. We should take a look 
at the Angels' books and decide if and why they are losing money. Maybe it's 
because they have not played .500 baseball in four years. 
</P>
<P>
 Before county or city governmental entities contemplate spending (or risking 
through bonds) dime one of taxpayer money for sports franchises, they should 
obtain a contractual commitment to field winning teams from the benefited 
teams. If the teams fail to attain a specific winning percentage over a period 
of time, they should be subject to financial penalties. 
</P>
<P>
 If the private sector must have its folly in the name of community boosterism, 
I urge those individuals and corporations not to leave the business skills that 
allow them the pleasure of these indulgences at the door. A condition for 
improved facilities should include the teams putting their respective 
ownerships in escrow as a guarantee for improved team records. 
</P>
<P>
 Lately the fans in Orange County have been fed a steady diet of professional 
sports mediocrity. The notion that this problem would be solved through 
improved facilities is nonsense. The Raiders have one of the highest 
percentages among franchises in sports history, yet they have consistently 
played in subpar stadiums. If we are going to commit public resources for 
improved or new stadiums, the community and its fans should get something in 
return: quality teams. 
</P>
<P>
 WILLIAM R. MITCHELL 
</P>
<P>
 Newport Beach 
</P>
<P>
 * Regarding the efforts of Leigh Steinberg and the "Save the Rams" group, 
though their intentions are noble, I question if they are really operating with 
the facts. A new stadium, even for an existing tenant, doesn't guarantee fan 
support. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the Atlanta Falcons moved into the new state-of-the-art Georgia 
Dome, with official capacity at 71,280. The Falcons managed to sell out three 
of eight regular season home games. The reason: The Falcons had a lousy team 
and consistently have been poor, much like the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
 If the city of Anaheim is truly wanting to help, they should let the Rams 
leave, get the stadium paid off, make a commitment to the Angels to build a 
baseball-only facility and make a sweetened offer to bring the Raiders to 
Anaheim. If any team has the right to complain about their facility, it is the 
Raiders. Though Al Davis is a pain to deal with, at least he is committed to 
putting a winning team on the field, something that will never happen with the 
current Ram ownership. 
</P>
<P>
 The bottom line remains the same. Who is running a franchise matters much more 
than where the franchise is located.

 * "Anaheim Stadium Is Sadly Out of Date," (Editorial, July 31), says who? 
</P>
<P>
 When I go to the ballpark for a day of baseball, hot dogs and peanuts, I can't 
wait to get past the entrance and miles upon miles of architecture. Pardon me, 
but people go to cultural centers and various other places to admire mammoth 
architecture. The ballpark is meant for one reason: playing ball. What's 
fashionable in stadium trends is hardly what Anaheim should be concerned with. 
Keeping the teams here is paramount, but making huge structural changes on the 
whims of owners and politicians is wasteful and unnecessary. Focus on bettering 
the community, not the concrete.

 * Re: "Newer Stadiums Leave Anaheim in the Dust" (July 11): 
</P>
<P>
 With its unpainted concrete corridors, massive traffic jams and men's room 
urinal more at home in an outhouse than in near-21st-Century Orange County, 
demolition of the current stadium structure will prove to be no big loss to 
anyone. However, we must have sufficient seats in a new stadium to meet the 
need of future population growth. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason so many seats are left vacant now is less lack of potential demand 
than the poor performance of the teams playing there. I can still recall how 
difficult it was to get football game tickets until the Rams became the Lambs. 
Besides, the construction of a new stadium will boost our local economy and 
will make Anaheim an even more appealing entertainment center. 
</P>
<P>
 Judging by the enormous success the Duck Pond has achieved in such a short 
time, anything less than a spanking new stadium with better quake-resistant 
designs will be unacceptable.

PAY NOW OR LATER FOR FAMILY PROGRAMS; DAY CARE, NUTRITION PROJECT NEED PUBLIC'S 
HELP, DOLLARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It is worth remembering that enlightened family policies really can count for 
those who are at risk, or who need a boost in getting over the hump to 
financial independence. Two Orange County situations are illustrative of how 
government funding choices and programs can help make a difference one way or 
the other. 
</P>
<P>
 We hear a lot of abstract political rhetoric about welfare reform and how to 
foster self-sufficiency. At a recent meeting of the nation's governors, the 
issue was a front-burner topic as cash-strapped states look to reorder 
priorities to put their public assistance dollars to the best use. 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond the political debate is the political reality of what is going on in 
communities. In the poorest neighborhood of Santa Ana, the Pride Development 
Council's day-care center, which has been operating for 17 years, has been 
struggling to stay afloat after a second consecutive year of devastating cuts.  
</P>
<P>
 In 1993, the city reduced to $17,500 the amount of community development money 
it granted the center. It had given $45,000 the previous year. Then, last 
month, the city could find only $13,000 after a commission set up to examine 
programs found about 66 worthwhile ones that were competing for a share of the 
pie. The founder of Pride Development, Dorothy Davis, says that unless she can 
raise more than $80,000, the center might have to close by the end of the year. 
But the reality of spending to help working parents is that the government can 
put up money now or it can put it up later. Massachusetts Gov. William Weld, 
for one, contends that his state would be better off financially if it paid for 
day care and other costs associated with getting welfare recipients back to 
work. 
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Ana commission no doubt had other worthy causes, but it is difficult 
to imagine a better investment than the amount that goes into the $250,000 
budget for Pride Development's day-care program, which is spread through 
donations, student tuition and other grants. Ultimately, the inability of 
government to invest in day care for those in need may simply end up coming out 
of another public pocket. 
</P>
<P>
 As a practical matter, some way or another should be found to keep the center 
operating. Perhaps private donations can tide the center over for another year. 
Those who can should volunteer. Maybe some donated accounting help could assist 
the center in keeping its financing and records on track, so that it will be 
able to make the most of its scarce dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 Some better news was that allocations are catching up with the reality in 
Orange County, making it possible for a new infusion of money for the county 
from the Women, Infants and Children (WIC) Supplemental Food Program. For 
years, the county has been underfunded for a sound program that serves pregnant 
women, breast-feeding mothers and babies at risk for health problems caused by 
poor nutrition. New census figures and changes in federal and state allocation 
policies have brought an increase in funding. 
</P>
<P>
 But the organizers are sufficiently heartened that they have launched an 
effort to reach out to the community, the goal of serving working, low-income 
families who might not recognize that they fall within WIC's income eligibility 
criteria. Getting young people off to the right start is crucial, and a boon 
for working families trying to make ends meet.  
</P>
<P>
 One way or the other, we are going to have to pay. Programs like the day-care 
center in Santa Ana and the WIC program are designed to give people a fighting 
chance so they can help themselves and their families.

CHECK THE FACTS ABOUT ANIMAL SHELTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Not everyone is "thrilled" with Mission Viejo's animal services ("Political 
Dogfight Expected Over City Animal Shelter," July 25). Certainly not the 
100-plus dogs murdered (euthanized) last year by this "humane" shelter. The 
number of animals that they kill this year will be even greater. In fact, on a 
per-capita basis, I suspect that the percentage of animals killed exceeds that 
of the Orange County Animal Shelter in Orange. 
</P>
<P>
 Before animal lovers rush into a regional shelter with Mission Viejo, they 
should examine the facts. Mission Viejo offers animals no more chance of life 
than the county. It will cost taxpayers more money. ($2.3 million for unusable 
hillside land). It is a few miles closer for residents of South Orange County, 
though. 
</P>
<P>
 You should present the facts of life for a dog or cat found in Mission Viejo. 
What are the odds they will be killed? And what if a dog or cat is found in 
Irvine? Or San Clemente? And don't forget the county. 
</P>
<P>
 When and where will animals receive truly humane treatment? The facts argue 
against Mission Viejo being the place. 
</P>

 * For the life of me I cannot see what all the fuss is about regarding the 
folks who object to Mission Viejo's animal shelter. Aside from the platform it 
gives some politically ambitious people, the shelter is merely adequate for the 
city's present needs for caring for animals. 
</P>
<P>
 It boggles the mind that anyone would complain about a structure that is 
harmlessly new and takes advantage of thoughtful planning and design. Sure, the 
shelter wasn't built from discarded lumber and rusted nails, but there were 
some donated materials and lots of donated hours to put both the structure and 
the operations in place. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that long ago, an earlier City Council felt that the coffers were so full 
that every resident should receive a $500 tax refund. Sensible voters said no. 
We said no so that just such community assistance as an animal shelter could be 
provided. 
</P>
<P>
 A running terror afflicts the taxpayer, and it is all too easy to seize on 
catchy phrases such as "the Taj Mahal" without checking on the facts. For a 
short while, I was one of the 50-some volunteers at the shelter. Cleaning cages 
was my forte. While there, I noted the extreme dedication of both paid and 
unpaid workers, who are too busy to respond to diatribes against the shelter. 
Phones ring constantly. Some "customers" are rude, stupid and cruel. The staff 
is intensely busy, rescuing, cleaning, feeding, dosing, dipping, and, if there 
is time, loving these tender brutes who ask nothing more than to be given 
decent lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Would that the complainers come down and contribute instead of endlessly 
carping.

AN INSPIRATION TO ORANGEWOOD YOUTH; FORMER SHELTER RESIDENT SHOWS OTHERS THAT 
THEY TOO CAN TURN THEIR LIVES AROUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Given the turbulence of his childhood, no one could blame Michael McKenzie for 
turning his back on his past. Instead, he revisits it continuously, trying to 
show those unfortunate enough to follow in his footsteps that there is a way 
out. 
</P>
<P>
 McKenzie is 22 years old now, a college student whose easy smile is a sharp 
contrast with the dour visage of his depressed youth. His father left the 
family when McKenzie was an infant, and his mother was an alcoholic. When 
things got real bad at home, the police would be called and would take him to 
the Orangewood Children's Home, the county-run home in Orange for troubled and 
abused youth. He was there five times, missing long stretches of school and 
shuttling between foster homes. When he lived with his mother, it was in 
poverty, often in rundown motels and sometimes in warehouses. 
</P>
<P>
 McKenzie was 15 when his mother died. A San Clemente stockbroker became a 
foster father to McKenzie, got him professional help, and stood by the youth 
even after he dropped out of school and sank into depression. It paid off. 
</P>
<P>
 The teen-ager managed to turn his life around, and two years ago he returned 
to Orangewood and helped create a peer-counseling program. Orangewood 
counselors said the program has succeeded in answering residents' questions 
about drugs, suicide, pregnancy and similar topics. McKenzie and 17 other 
former Orangewood residents, all trained for the program, show up every two 
weeks to offer their special brand of assistance. They also offer themselves as 
examples that there can be success after Orangewood. 
</P>
<P>
 McKenzie and his fellow counselors provide a good example of giving something 
back to their community. His foster father, Peter McKenzie, also was a role 
model and an inspiration to McKenzie. Society would benefit from many more like 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 Orangewood counselors said they took a special delight in McKenzie's success 
because they see so many youths who are unable to turn their lives around when 
they leave the home. Those who work with abused children have tough jobs; they 
deserve all the successes they achieve.

ABUSE OF TRUST IN DOCTORS AND PARENTS; STATE SHOULD STUDY EXTENSION OF TIME 
LIMIT ON PROSECUTING SOME SEX CRIMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Working on a separate track from the previous Orange County district 
attorney's inquiry into accusations of sex crimes, federal prosecutors have 
indicted former Tustin gynecologist Ivan C. Namihas on mail fraud charges for 
allegedly billing patients and insurers for unnecessary tests and treatments. 
The fact that sexual abuse charges could not be brought presents reason for 
Sacramento to reconsider the length of the statute of limitations on that kind 
of crime in certain circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
 The case involves more than 100 sexual abuse complaints by former patients, 
many of whom said the alleged incidents occurred five to 10 years earlier. That 
meant the statute of limitations of one year on such crimes had expired. As it 
was, the state Medical Board took away Namihas' license in June, 1992, after he 
declined to defend himself against sexual molestation charges at a court 
hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 The federal alternative was to present a Los Angeles grand jury with evidence 
of alleged criminal activity dating back to July, 1989, the indictment 
centering on 14 instances when Namihas allegedly billed patients and insurers 
fraudulently for what were called "unnecessary and improper examinations." The 
indictment said that Namihas convinced patients that their health was in 
jeopardy and obtained victims' consent to "further, more expensive treatment." 
Namihas was arrested in Las Vegas, where he now lives. 
</P>
<P>
 An extended statute of limitations in sexual abuse cases in this instance 
might have resulted in charges of that kind. The problem with extending a 
statute in sexual abuse cases is that it might involve complaints that come 
after a long period, once memories have faded and evidence might not be 
available. So a statute of limitations serves a purpose of discouraging 
complaints that are not brought quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 However, it may be that in certain cases involving doctors or parents -- that 
is, in situations where allegations of abuse violate either implicit or legal 
arrangements of trust -- that an extension of some kind, say an additional two 
years to file a complaint, may be warranted. In the case of doctors, witnesses 
may want to come forward as a result of disclosures by others that validate 
their own personal experiences. 
</P>
<P>
 Namihas deserves his day in court on the mail fraud charges, but the 
frustration of local authorities in airing the sexual abuse component may be a 
good incentive for the Legislature to examine whether the statute of 
limitations should be extended.

NO PROTECTION IN SHELTER PLANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * The idea that the neighbors surrounding the proposed site of the Eli Home 
are "against the prevention of abuse to children," as Mike Edmiston carelessly 
asserts in his letter to The Times (July 31) is absurd.  
</P>
<P>
 The Eli Home and other shelters like it serve an invaluable function in our 
community.This is not the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 What is at issue is the responsibility of the shelter to protect its residents 
and its neighbors. We believe the proposed site will not reasonably allow for 
either. 
</P>
<P>
 This is a small residential neighborhood, which is neither zoned for nor able 
to accommodate such a facility. 
</P>
<P>
 We have all been witness to the astonishing levels that domestic violence can 
rise, yet Lori Galloway, executive director of the Eli Corp., assures us that 
the possibility of violence at the shelter is "slim to none." 
</P>
<P>
 Why then do other shelters such as Orangewood (in Orange) maintain elaborate 
security systems including gates, guards and evening lockdown? 
</P>
<P>
 Edmiston mentions that he is in the process of moving to Anaheim Hills. What 
he does not mention is that he is a member of Eli Corp.'s board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
 He also does not mention in which neighborhood he will be living, but it's 
doubtful that it will be in the area surrounding the proposed site for the Eli 
Home.

WELFARE AGENCIES WORK FEVERISHLY TO PROTECT THE JOBS OF BUREAUCRATS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Thanks for reporting on yet another hustle by the "welfarecrats," the WIC 
program, one of Hillary's favorites ("A Boost to Babies," July 30). 
</P>
<P>
 Vouchers worth "an average of $30/month" are being distributed as fast as they 
can find recipients. But the "spendocrats" aren't stopping there. They are out 
beating the bushes for even more "takers." They just can't spend our money fast 
enough. 
</P>
<P>
 Thirty dollars a month to 45,500 recipients adds up to $16.3 million a year. 
Add the $4.3 million "operating budget," and include the additional hidden 
salaries and expenses, and we're looking at a possible $50-million program just 
for Orange County alone! (Welfare expenditures typically run 70% for the 
bureaucracies, 30% for the recipients.) 
</P>
<P>
 If these young mothers only need $30 a month to separate themselves from 
disaster, why aren't they being inspired to earn it themselves ? A few hours of 
baby-sitting here and a few hours of housecleaning there, wouldn't take long to 
earn $30. 
</P>
<P>
 What we've got here is another chapter of the Nanny State working feverishly 
to "hook" new "addicts" on handouts and create more dependents in order to 
justify their own jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 The welfare state is bankrupt financially and ideologically. Those of us who 
are robbed to fund it demand its abolishment. NOW!

 * There are two sides to every story, even when it comes to helping little 
babies. In regards to the WIC (Women, Infants and Children) supplemental food 
program, I would like to let your readers know some facts that weren't 
mentioned. 
</P>
<P>
 * Participants do not have to be citizens, In fact, Immigration Service cannot 
wait outside WIC premises to pick up illegals. 
</P>
<P>
 * The review by the U.S. General Accounting Office that "every dollar spent on 
WIC Services saves the taxpayers $3 on medical care in the infant's first year 
of life," is based on an old report from the 1970s. It also pertains only to 
the benefits from supplementing the mother's diet. It does not say anything 
about providing formula to the newborns or toddlers. 
</P>
<P>
 * Pediatricians and dietitians agree that breast milk is best. It is an 
untapped resource in our society. Breast-fed infants are healthier. This is 
what will save the taxpayers dollars, not providing expensive formula to the 
poor. 
</P>
<P>
 * Nutritionists are afraid that if formula is not provided, the mothers will 
give their babies cow milk, resulting in illness. I do not believe that the 
majority of mothers, poor or not, will do something to harm their babies. And 
if they do, it is not the taxpayers' problem. We need to teach responsibility, 
not dependency. 
</P>
<P>
 * In fact, despite contrary belief, formula-fed babies are sicker more often 
than babies fed milk due to improper dilutions. 
</P>
<P>
 * Many first generation immigrants who are WIC clients have breast fed in 
their native country but switch to formula in the U.S. Could it be because it 
is free to them? 
</P>
<P>
 * WIC contractors can be run through local government or private management 
companies. It is my experience, since I have worked at both, that the clinics 
run by the private sector are more efficient and less wasteful. 
</P>
<P>
 I worked for WIC as a consultant and an intern. I believe in the educational 
component of the program as well as providing food for pregnant and lactating 
women. But I do not believe in a government program that finds it necessary to 
expand and grow. Putting up flyers in coin-operated laundries is an insult to 
taxpayers. Is it really an attempt to help the "needy" or an effort to secure 
jobs and big government?

ORANGE COUNTY VOICES; COMMENTARY ON SMOKING; KEEPING TOBACCO AWAY FROM OUR 
CHILDREN IS VITAL TO HEALTH; THE TOBACCO INDUSTRY DENIES THAT ADVERTISING IS 
AIMED AT YOUNG PEOPLE, BUT WHAT ADULT IDENTIFIES WITH JOE CAMEL?  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHILIP DiSAIA, Dr. Philip DiSaia is president of the American Cancer 
Society, Orange County Region. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In signing Assembly Bill 13, the governor did what businesses and consumers 
have wanted for some time. He created a "level playing field" throughout the 
state in the area of tobacco control. With those strokes of his pen, he made 
the November "Philip Morris" ballot initiative 188 unnecessary, leaving in 
place those local and county ordinances that have gone an additional step 
toward protecting the health and safety of Orange County residents and 
visitors. 
</P>
<P>
 Many Orange County jurisdictions have banned vending machines because they 
make tobacco readily available to our youth. 
</P>
<P>
 Access is the key to the prevention of addiction, tobacco-related disease and 
subsequent death. Nearly all first use of tobacco occurs before graduation from 
high school, resulting in many adolescent smokers becoming addicted to 
nicotine. 
</P>
<P>
 Tobacco industry executives and their spokespeople continue to ignore the 
scientific evidence proving that nicotine is addictive and tobacco use does 
lead to illness and premature death, often stating these beliefs under oath. We 
cannot rely on these individuals to create a safe "level playing field." 
</P>
<P>
 The truth is, the ballot initiative would allow people to smoke in 
restaurants, hotels, sports facilities, workplaces and public places, exposing 
millions of Californians to cancer-causing secondhand smoke. Their initiative 
would overturn all smoking-control laws passed in cities and counties, more 
than 25 in Orange County alone, making it illegal for stronger laws to pass in 
the future. 
</P>
<P>
 Facts show that in Orange County alone, this year tobacco will kill 1,185 of 
our friends and neighbors and 1,525 new cases of lung cancer will appear. 
</P>
<P>
 Nationwide, tobacco will contribute to more than 400,000 premature deaths in 
1994. A large number of these deaths could be prevented with the elimination of 
tobacco use. Tobacco is the single most preventable cause of premature death, 
and secondhand smoke, the third most preventable cause. No one can be aware of 
the statistics and still argue for slowing our efforts to control its effects. 
</P>
<P>
 Legislation can't do the job alone. It is unrealistic to believe that banning 
tobacco sales would be any more effective than was Prohibition. Even with laws 
on the books prohibiting the sale of tobacco products to minors, children as 
young as 10 can and do get tobacco either in vending machines or from those who 
ignore the laws and sell these products over the counter to minors. 
</P>
<P>
 Laws can, and now will, protect non-users from exposure and secondhand smoke, 
at least in public indoor areas. They can and will (if enforced) protect the 
workplace and benefit employers monetarily through greater productivity, less 
absenteeism and lower health care costs. 
</P>
<P>
 To influence the next and future generations, we must look at society as a 
whole and at education in particular. 
</P>
<P>
 Tobacco must cease to be a symbol of "the good life" and the "coming of age" 
for our youth. Tobacco use does not confer on one the ability to make wise 
choices. It does not make one tall, thin, beautiful or athletically skilled, in 
spite of what advertising would have us believe. A party, a day at the beach, a 
horseback ride in the country are not more fun with a burning tube in our 
mouths. 
</P>
<P>
 Cigarette advertising does increase young people's risk of smoking by 
affecting their perceptions of the persuasiveness, image breaking and glamour 
of smoking. The tobacco industry denies that advertising is aimed at young 
people, but what adult identifies with Joe or Josephine Camel? What adult is 
fooled into thinking that a cigarette will add to the pleasure of a day at the 
Indy 500, unless that adult is already addicted? 
</P>
<P>
 So what are we doing to change community acceptance of tobacco use? Orange 
County is doing a lot. 
</P>
<P>
 The county Health Care Agency, the American Cancer Society, the American Lung 
Assn., the American Heart Assn., the Orange County Department of Education and 
numerous groups in our varied ethnic communities work cooperatively to offer 
cessation assistance to smokers. Health care professionals train for tobacco 
cessation. Programs such as "Teens Not Tobacco" train teen-agers to educate 
convenience store vendors about state laws prohibiting the sale of tobacco to 
minors. Contests are held focusing on innovative tobacco use prevention, both 
for our youth and the families that need to further their education on the 
dangers of tobacco. These education initiatives have reached virtually every 
school-age child, including Head Start. The public in every age group and in 
all our diverse communities has had access to materials about tobacco both at 
health fairs and other community celebrations. 
</P>
<P>
 What are the results in Orange County? We have the lowest adult smoking rate 
in the state, and California is second only to Utah in having the lowest 
smoking rate in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 Can we rest on these laurels? Not yet. If the initiative, Proposition 188 
passes, all that our local elected officials and the many groups and 
individuals have and are doing will have gone for naught. Our disease and death 
rate from tobacco use will rise. More of our youth will become addicted. 
</P>
<P>
 We in Orange County and the state of California are taking the lead toward 
safer, healthier and more productive lives. Let's stay the course.

'FULL INCLUSION' DEBATE INVOLVES ABILITIES, RIGHTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * After reading your article "Teachers Balk at Full Inclusion of Disabled 
Students" (July 19), I'm left with a sense of sadness for my daughter, who 
happens to have Down's syndrome, as well as all the other youngsters whose 
educability is being measured on their "disabilities" rather than their 
abilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Full inclusion is a concept that should have been enveloped by our school 
officials, teachers, parents and community decades ago. Full inclusion supports 
not only the letter of the law but also the spirit. What full inclusion offers 
is the same opportunity we offer all other youngsters: a chance to learn and 
grow in the least restrictive environment possible. 
</P>
<P>
 Our educational system is suffering from a number of ailments, including large 
budget cuts, increased class size, violence and lack of parental involvement 
and support. Our teachers have been asked to take on the burden of providing a 
quality education while their resources and support are being cut at every 
corner. These are the real problems that need to be dealt with, but not at the 
expense of a very large group of people who deserve equal rights and 
opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
 What those educators who balk at full inclusion need to be made aware of are 
the many fiscal and educational benefits that all students will reap through 
thoughtfully administered full inclusion programs. There are many full 
inclusion programs throughout Orange County that are win-win situations for 
everyone involved. These programs need to be recognized and even used as models 
in establishing full inclusion programs across the board. 
</P>

 * Our hearts naturally go out to parents of children who are adjudged special 
needs students. At the same time, there are many of us Californians who 
remember well the days our state ranked, educationally, among the top in the 
nation. Today we have plummeted near the bottom. 
</P>
<P>
 The cause of this, of course, comes from many, many factors. An obvious 
contributor, however, is classroom overcrowding (to unmanageable proportions) 
forced on our teachers. Add to this an ever-growing demand by some parents that 
their handicapped child be totally integrated within their public school. The 
many disruptions such a youngster can create in his class can only diminish 
that teacher's instructional ability and time for the other class members. 
There can be no other result, more especially now because budgetary restraints 
make teachers' aides fewer. 
</P>
<P>
 Some parents of these children are coming both from hidden agendas of their 
own as well as a state of denial. But what is paramount, and what the issue 
really boils down to, is the interests of the majority and that it be best 
served. At the present time it is being sadly abused. 
</P>
<P>
 In California, a special education youngster is provided a teacher trained in 
special needs and with special materials. Such a youngster receives a far 
better education in this setting.

CONTROVERSY OVER RAILROAD NOISE RAISES SOME SOUND QUESTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Reading "Sound Wall Appeal Falls on Deaf Ears" (July 28) several questions 
occurred to me. 1. Why did (Karen Winkle) decide to live next to the railroad 
tracks if the noise bothers her? I assume no one pointed a gun at her and 
forced her to move. 
</P>
<P>
 2. What moronic lawyer told her the city was responsible for protecting her 
from the consequences of her residential choices? 
</P>
<P>
 3. Why is this news? Every time a person looks to any public organization to 
address difficulties brought about by the individual's choices, we foster the 
idiotic notion that there is no need for that individual to accept 
responsibility for his or her own decisions.  
</P>
<P>
 If you want to help these pathetic people maybe you should start a fund, 
contributions to which would assist them to move. Perhaps if no one were 
willing to live there, the owners of the property would do something. I fail to 
see why the city, or, any public agency, should be required to do anything 
other than rezoning the land as not suitable for residential use.

 * Sound pollution: Why do we place altitude restrictions on airplanes, line 
our freeway systems with concrete walls, then exempt railroads "from addressing 
environment impacts caused by train traffic on a community," per Anaheim Mayor 
Tom Daly. 
</P>
<P>
 Being a Santa Ana resident who lives within the earsplitting impact of train 
whistles on a daily basis, I truly empathize with Karen Winkle and her 
Northfield Avenue neighbors in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 Why should this one mass transit system, the railroads, have legislative 
exemption from environmental concerns?  
</P>
<P>
 Isn't it about time to rescind this obsolete exemption and "take actions that 
protect, restore and enhance the environment," thus forcing the railroads to 
become accountable under the National Environmental Policy Act? NEPA became law 
in 1969. A great 25th anniversary gift to all the long suffering public living 
alongside railroad tracks would be in harnessing the railroads into this 
compliance. 
</P>

<P>
 * It was hard for me to understand why the health, safety and well-being of 
the residents living alongside the railroad (were) so low on the Anaheim City 
Council's priority list. Then I realized something. We are humans. We're not 
Ducks, Dolphins, Rams or a cute little Mouse. If we were any of these, I'm sure 
they would be falling all over themselves to accommodate us. 
</P>
<P>
 I have also learned something during my conversations with the railroad. I now 
know that God is a locomotive. We do have Angels in Anaheim, so maybe they 
could put in a good word for us. 
</P>
<P>
 I don't know if it counts or not, but the residents along the railroad line 
now bear a strong resemblance to some other Anaheim residents. Being woke up 
several times a night makes us very Sleepy during the day, which could account 
for some of the Dopey things we do and, of course, this makes us Grumpy. 
</P>
<P>
 We would all be Happy if the railroad, OCTA, and the city of Anaheim would 
take responsibility for making our lives miserable and rectify the problem now 
with a safety-sound wall. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 * The controversy about noise along the Santa Fe tracks in Anaheim illustrates 
why businesses are leaving this state. What were the residents thinking when 
they bought their homes next to a mainline railroad? Those noisy freight trains 
were there on the day they first viewed their homes. No one made them move 
there, so why don't they quit whining, quit looking for someone else to take 
care of them, and pay for sound walls themselves? 
</P>
<P>
 Worse yet is Anaheim Mayor Tom Daly's opinion that the Santa Fe should be held 
responsible. For what, Mr. Mayor? Santa Fe had no control over that one; your 
city staff allowed homes to be built next to the mainline. They could have 
required sound walls, sound insulation, zoned the land differently, anything, 
but did not. Daly ought to have his head examined and consider how many jobs 
have been lost in California because we continue to make doing business here a 
nightmare, rather than admit our own poor planning and follies. 
</P>
<P>
 That route has been one of the key lifelines for the region since 1887, 
carrying food, raw materials and consumer goods vital to our quality of life, 
cheaper and with a lot less environmental impact than trucks. Our residents and 
leaders, including the good mayor, need to be sophisticated enough to realize 
that a lifestyle of prosperity and abundance doesn't just mean a trip to the 
mall, but that it includes supporting the industries and infrastructure that 
produce and deliver what we consume. 
</P>
<P>
 Until we stop our destructively myopic policies regarding business, we will 
continue to lose jobs, and ultimately the very lifestyle we think we are 
protecting.

WOODFORDE UPSETS KRAJICEK; TENNIS: AUSTRALIAN KNOCKS OUT DEFENDING CHAMPION, 
WILL FACE WINNER OF BECKER-STOLTENBERG.

<P>
 Mark Woodforde survived Richard Krajicek's 120-m.p.h. serves and a three-set 
battle in 110-degree heat Saturday, advancing to the Los Angeles Open final 
with a 6-3, 3-6, 6-3 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Woodforde reached his first final of the year and will play either No. 2 Boris 
Becker or No. 6 Jason Stoltenberg in today's championship on the UCLA campus. 
</P>
<P>
 "Reaching a final is fantastic," said Woodforde, an Australian ranked 53rd in 
the world in singles, but known primarily for his doubles success. "It's a 
great feeling." 
</P>
<P>
 Woodforde's first victory over Krajicek in five career meetings was a replay 
of the 1992 LA Open final, which Krajicek won in three sets. Krajicek, the 
fifth seed from the Netherlands, also won here in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, Woodforde's serve-and-volley game withstood Krajicek's booming 
serve, which produced 13 aces to Woodforde's 10. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has a good serve and a good volley and those are his biggest strengths," 
Krajicek said. 
</P>
<P>
 Woodforde led 40-love in the sixth game of the first set before Krajicek saved 
one break point, then double faulted to lose the game. Krajicek had two break 
points in the final game, but failed to capitalize and lost the first set. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mark played pretty well," Krajicek said. "It was very hot. I was struggling 
more today than yesterday. I should have done more serve-and-volley and 
pressured the guy." 
</P>
<P>
 Krajicek, ranked 25th in the world, quickly recovered in the second set, 
taking a 4-2 lead before serving it out to tie the match. 
</P>
<P>
 In the third, Woodforde had three break points when Krajicek fired two aces to 
reach deuce. Another big serve and a backhand drop volley allowed Krajicek to 
tie it up, 2-2. 
</P>
<P>
 "I did get a bit discouraged when I got those three break points," Woodforde 
said. "Before I used to show my frustration, but today I just wanted to 
concentrate. I couldn't have played two better points, but then he made a 
fantastic backhand." 
</P>
<P>
 Woodforde committed three double faults in the seventh game, but nailed a 
crosscourt backhand volley winner to go up 4-3.

U.S. GOLFERS SUDDENLY FACE THEIR FIRST MAJOR SHUTOUT; PGA CHAMPIONSHIP: FOREIGN 
CONTINGENT HAS WON FIRST THREE TOURNAMENTS OF GRAND SLAM THIS YEAR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Maybe it's time to stop bashing the Americans and just say that golf is a 
truly international game. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe not. 
</P>
<P>
 The PGA Championship opens at Southern Hills Country Club on Thursday with the 
United States facing its first shutout in the four major championships since 
the Masters was created in 1934. 
</P>
<P>
 With three majors gone, the winners this year were Jose Maria Olazabal of 
Spain in the Masters, Ernie Els of South Africa in the U.S. Open and Nick Price 
of Zimbabwe in the British Open. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, Americans have lost their lock on the major championships. And, yes the 
winners' list this year on the PGA Tour reads more like a Who's That than a 
Who's Who. 
</P>
<P>
 But no other country is dominating the game, either. Winners are coming from 
all over the globe. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe what it all all adds up to is this: 
</P>
<P>
 Golf HAS become a truly international game, but the Americans STILL should be 
bashed. 
</P>
<P>
 "American golf is getting hammered," said Paul Azinger, the defending PGA 
champion just returning to competition after a year sidelined with cancer. 
"It's tiring listening to that. We are all golfers. Some are born in South 
Africa, some are born in America. I think it's a wonderful thing that there is 
so much competition." 
</P>
<P>
 Competition there is. Consider this: 
</P>
<P>
 Seven of the last nine major championships have been won by non-Americans. Six 
of those seven foreign winners have been different people from six different 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond Price, Els and Olazabal, there was Greg Norman of Australia in the 1993 
British Open, Bernhard Langer of Germany in the 1993 Masters and Nick Faldo of 
England in the 1992 British Open. 
</P>
<P>
 The only American winners in that stretch back to the '92 British Open were 
Azinger, in last year's PGA, and Lee Janzen, in last year's U.S. Open. 
</P>
<P>
 Price was the only repeat winner, taking the 1992 PGA along with this year's 
British Open. 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, the foreign players have shown an astonishing depth. It's THEM 
against US and the THEMS from just about anywhere have shown they can beat US. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone wants to beat the Americans because the Americans have always been 
the best, whether in sports or war," Azinger said. "'Anyone from just about 
anywhere could win." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the anyones from just about anywhere in the United States have shown 
they can win on the PGA Tour. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider this: 
</P>
<P>
 The only multiple winner on the PGA Tour this year is Price, who has three 
tour wins plus the British Open. 
</P>
<P>
 Going into the Buick Open, seven PGA Tour events since the third week of March 
were claimed by first-time winners. 
</P>
<P>
 Jot down these names: 
</P>
<P>
 Loren Roberts, Mike Springer, Mike Heinen, Neal Lancaster, Tom Lehman, Brian 
Henninger and Dicky Pride. 
</P>
<P>
 Are you betting on any of them this week in the PGA? 
</P>
<P>
 Likely not. 
</P>
<P>
 The first names to go in the office pools are still Price, Norman, Faldo, 
maybe Els, Olazabal and Langer. 
</P>
<P>
 When it comes time to list American contenders, who do we name? Tom Watson, 44 
and a non-winner since 1987; Fuzzy Zoeller, 42 and a non-winner since 1986; 
Raymond Floyd, 51, Hale Irwin, 49, Tom Kite, 44, and Ben Crenshaw, 42. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the young studs, Janzen has been inconsistent since winning the U.S. 
Open in 1993; Fred Couples took the Masters in 1992 and appeared to be among 
the best in the world before a messy divorce distracted him and a back injury 
shelved him. 
</P>
<P>
 And Azinger, winner of three tournaments in 1993, including the PGA, in the 
top-three 10 times -- the most since Watson in 1980 -- and possessor of at 
least one victory each year since 1987, had his run at greatness slowed by 
cancer late last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Watson says the foreign domination is partly a cyclical thing. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are just in an era now where players from overseas have won more majors," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Watson also thinks American golfers have become less competitive for two 
reasons: Easy entries and easy earnings. 
</P>
<P>
 "It might have to do with the all-exempt tour," Watson said. "It doesn't 
promote the competition the old tour did. Monday qualifying was a big character 
builder." 
</P>
<P>
 And then there is money. 
</P>
<P>
 "I truly believe that money corrupts desire," said Watson, who is the only 
American to finish in the top 10 in all three major championships this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not only in golf but in pro sports everywhere, and in business," he said. 
"Some of the fear of not having it goes away. When that fear leaves you, your 
desire probably weakens," Watson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you didn't finish in the top 30 money winners when I first came on the 
tour, you probably weren't breaking even." 
</P>
<P>
 Going into the Buick Open, Janzen was in 30th place on this year's money list 
and had already won $359,295. And 127 players had won more than $100,000 for 
the year.

BUDDY RYAN IS BACK IN TOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Buddy's Back. 
</P>
<P>
 Restored as a head coach, this time in Arizona, Buddy Ryan's got some old 
friends to reinforce his reputation as a defensive wizard. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the San Francisco 49ers had lost only two NFL exhibitions since 1991, 
they were silenced by Ryan's 46 defense -- led by his former Philadelphia 
Eagles defensive end Clyde Simmons -- in a 17-7 defeat Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Ryan, hired to lead the Cardinals from their usual position near the bottom of 
the NFC East, showed the 49ers and the rest of the league exactly what could be 
in the offing. 
</P>
<P>
 First, free agent acquisition Simmons -- like former Eagles teammate Seth 
Joyner, a follower of Ryan -- plucked a Steve Young pass out of the air for a 
5-yard TD interception return in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 As if to prove the 46 to those who remained among the doubters, Simmons 
stopped the 49ers later in the game with another interception. That impressed 
Young. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really had respect for them last year, even when others might not have 
noticed, but they ought to put Clyde Simmons at defensive back," Young said. 
"I've run that play a long time and I know that when a guy is charging at me he 
can't get his hands up very quickly. So he made a real nice play on that one." 
</P>
<P>
 The Cardinals got six turnovers -- including three interceptions by linemen. 
</P>
<P>
 Their play was reminiscent of those plays Ryan defenses made in Chicago, 
Phialdelphia (where he was head coach from 1986-80) and Houston. In Arizona, 
that should translate to large crowds -- part of what the Cardinals hoped for 
by hiring the high-profile Ryan. 
</P>
<P>
 They got what they bargained for, a crowd of 61,619 that shattered the 
previous preseason mark of 51,987 set Aug. 12, 1988 for the first Cardinals' 
first appearance ever in the desert. With the exception of a near-sellout 
73,025 for the Dallas game, the Friday night crowd was larger than that for any 
regular-season game in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Ryan wanted more. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I first got here, all the players told me how much they wanted a 
home-field advantage," he said. "Well, tonight they had one. That should show 
you what can happen. Now, we need to sell the place out." 
</P>
<P>
 The Arizona starters held Young to 6-for-9 passing and 63 yards through the 
second quarter, before he was replaced by former Michigan quarterback Elvis 
Grbac. 
</P>
<P>
 "The other team was getting after our butts," 49ers coach George Seifert said. 
</P>
<P>
 Grbac completed 14 of 23 passes for 117 yards, including an 8-yard scoring 
strike to Ed McCaffrey for the 49ers' lone score. He led San Francisco on a 
nine-play, 51-yard drive for the third quarter touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 Ryan said his backups left much to be desired. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was pleased with the first unit," he said. "But you can't believe how dumb 
we were on the second unit. But we had a lot of guys out there who hadn't 
played before." 
</P>
<P>
 Ryan was swarmed by cameras upon his entrance 30 minutes before kickoff and 
thousands cheered when his postgame news conference was shown on the video 
replay board. 
</P>
<P>
 The fans enjoyed the defense. So did middle linebacker Garth Jax, playing in 
place of the injured Eric Hill. Jax recovered a fumble in the fourth quarter, 
pleasing Ryan, who had given him a $20,000 raise a week ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "I should have gave him a $40,000 raise," Ryan said. "He got hurt and had to 
go back in and play the whole game. If I had 40 of him, I'd win every time."

IN THE NAME OF THE CHILDREN; GET TREATMENT OR GO TO JAIL, ONE SOUTH CAROLINA 
HOSPITAL TELLS DRUG-ABUSING PREGNANT WOMEN. NOW IT FACES A LAWSUIT AND A 
CIVIL-RIGHTS INVESTIGATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Barry Siegel, Times national correspondent Barry Siegel's last piece for 
this magazine was on a Georgia doctor accused of murdering an infant. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 IT ALL BEGAN, NURSE SHIRLEY BROWN AND HER COLLEAGUES AT THE Medical University 
of South Carolina now say, with the pregnant woman who appeared at the 
emergency room one morning in October, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman was suffering from abruptio placentae -- an abrupt separation of the 
placenta before labor. Her fetus was stillborn. They'd been seeing an 
increasing number of these abruptions at the hospital, a state institution in 
Charleston serving a largely indigent black population. The usual causes were 
conditions such as high blood pressure or trauma such as auto accidents. But 
the more recent cases didn't appear to have such causes. This case didn't 
appear to have any cause. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown and her boss, Dr. Edgar O. Horger III, then head of fetal-maternal 
medicine at the hospital, turned to the medical literature. In both 
professional journals and the popular press, they found, pregnant substance 
abusers were a hot topic. The figures were startling: One out of 10 fetuses in 
the United States is exposed to cocaine in the womb, affecting 375,000 babies a 
year. To Brown and Horger, sitting in genteel Charleston, such numbers sounded 
like a big-city problem. Still, article after article was suggesting cocaine as 
one cause for abruptions. 
</P>
<P>
 So Brown and her colleagues ran a urine drug screen on their patient. The 
woman tested positive for cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
 That was ground zero, they all agreed later. Their eyes now opened, Brown and 
her colleagues started running drug screens on other pregnant patients. Of the 
first four, three tested positive. Within one year, they had 119 positives, all 
but 15 of them women who'd first visited the hospital at the time of delivery.  
</P>
<P>
 They still didn't have a solution, though. Try as she might, Brown -- a 
manager for high-risk obstetrical cases -- could not get these women to the 
Charleston County Substance Abuse Commission. Despite counseling and cajoling, 
not a single woman kept her appointment for drug treatment. Of the 15 who came 
in before delivery, only one even came back for additional prenatal care. The 
hospital next saw the others when they returned in pre-term labor and once 
again tested positive for cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
 What to do? How to stop this?  
</P>
<P>
 What to do, the hospital staff eventually decided, was to cross a treacherous 
line. Prosecutors across the country, they knew, increasingly were going after 
pregnant substance abusers, charging dozens with distribution to minors and 
child neglect. We will join them, Brown and Horger resolved. If our patients 
test positive and refuse treatment, we'll hand them over to the law. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, it seemed an ideal, if unprecedented, solution. The goal, after 
all, was not to put these women in jail; the goal was to coerce them into 
treatment. But not everyone has applauded. Nor has everyone entirely shared the 
hospital's preference for treatment over jail. The decision to traffic with 
police and prosecutors, in fact, has drawn the hospital into an increasingly 
nasty quagmire, one that is as rich in calculated political posturing as in 
tortured ethical soul-searching. 
</P>
<P>
 Does society have a duty to intervene between a woman and her fetus? If so, 
when? Who or what public agent is responsible? What are the boundaries of 
government intrusion? 
</P>
<P>
 For having kicked up such questions, hospital and Charleston officials now 
face a $3-million civil lawsuit, a federal civil-rights investigation, a 
complaint filed with the National Institutes of Health and a chance of losing 
the hospital's federal funding, if not its accreditation. Everyone from the 
American Civil Liberties Union to the U.S. Department of Health and Human 
Services has rushed here to join what is at once a revealing test of difficult 
national issues and a scorching clash between law and medicine. 
</P>
<P>
 All sorts of agendas, reaching well beyond the perplexing world of medical 
ethics, are being played out in Charleston. New York lawyers jump off airplanes 
waving the Constitution and stacks of legal briefs. Southern politicians lean 
into microphones to orate about "personal responsibility." Feminists, hearing 
obvious echoes of the abortion debate, talk about control of the body and 
autonomy in the reproductive process. Such repercussions, coming from forces so 
far beyond their own world, have visibly shaken Horger, Brown and others on the 
hospital staff. They have not, however, persuaded them to back down. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown and Horger see the complexities, the imponderables, the obstacles, but 
they also see spontaneous abortions, pre-term deliveries, stillbirths and 
underdeveloped newborns with jumpy nervous systems. "It's a real difficult 
issue here," Shirley Brown says. "I can see both sides, I can see where 
everyone's coming from. But don't we finally have to make a decision? Don't we 
finally have to make a choice?" 
</P>
<P>
 IT WAS IN AUGUST, 1989, THAT BROWN MADE HER FATEFUL DECISION TO call Charles 
Condon, at the time the elected solicitor, or prosecutor, for Charleston and 
Berkeley counties. 
</P>
<P>
 By then, MUSC's drug-testing program had evolved considerably from its genesis 
nine months before. At first, the hospital's criteria for such screening had 
been informal, if not random; when doctors suspected a patient of substance 
abuse, for whatever reason, they simply ordered a test. This approach had made 
some at the hospital uneasy. Might they be ordering tests for other than 
medical reasons? Might they be ordering tests because the patient was poor or 
black or sullen or not like them? Virtually all those getting screened and 
testing positive, after all, were indigent blacks. 
</P>
<P>
 Listening to such concerns, it occurred to Brown that MUSC could be accused of 
discrimination. So in April, 1989, seeking to standardize the process, the 
hospital adopted a more formal protocol. Drug screens would be ordered for 
patients with any of six indicators: no prenatal care; abruptio placentae; 
intrauterine fetal death; pre-term labor, intrauterine growth retardation and 
previously known drug or alcohol abuse. Using these criteria, MUSC still found 
that it was mainly screening poor blacks -- in part because they compose much 
of the hospital's patient pool -- but hospital staffers no longer felt as 
uneasy about the selection process. Instead, they worried about the results 
they were seeing. 
</P>
<P>
 Month by month, the number of positive drug screens at the hospital kept 
rising. By summer, a full quarter of screened patients were testing positive 
for drugs -- up to 24 a month. Not one went for drug treatment. Brown and 
Horger felt more than frustrated; they felt they were witnessing a crime.  
</P>
<P>
 Cocaine, they knew, easily travels through the placenta to the fetus. There is 
no conclusive evidence about the drug's lasting impact on infants, since 
follow-up studies are scarce, and anecdotal reports of "neurobehavioral 
problems" don't separate cocaine's impact from influences such as poverty and 
family instability. But its immediate effects were often apparent at MUSC. 
Withdrawal, irritability, lethargy, stiff muscle tone, problems sleeping and 
eating, cardiovascular dysfunction, aversion to loud sounds or handling -- 
doctors could usually spot the exposed newborns. 
</P>
<P>
 It seemed to Brown and Horger that these were abused children. If so, wasn't 
the hospital staff legally responsible? Weren't they morally responsible? "We 
were not trying to rid the streets of cocaine," Horger recalled. "We were 
trying to stop harm to the fetus." 
</P>
<P>
 The Charleston solicitor's interest, however, proved somewhat different. 
Charles Condon nearly climbed out of his chair when Brown and others from MUSC, 
sitting in his office, revealed that they'd identified and treated more than 
100 pregnant substance abusers in the past 12 months.  
</P>
<P>
 "This has been going on?" he demanded. "This has been going on?" In Condon's 
view, the hospital had been doing nothing less than harboring criminals. He had 
a little problem with the fact that they'd known about cocaine users for a 
year. The hospital, he believed, had to report these cases once they had viable 
fetuses. 
</P>
<P>
 Condon's response reflected, in part, his particular bent. A Charleston native 
from a large Catholic family, Condon is, at 41, running for state attorney 
general after 12 years as county solicitor, a post he first won at age 27 -- 
"the youngest circuit solicitor ever elected in the history of South Carolina," 
his resume proudly notes. A Republican, Condon possesses the type of unabashed 
political streak that leads him to reveal, out of sheer delight, the pragmatic 
calculations -- Who could complain? Who has an interest in this? -- that shape 
his positions. "That's the real world" is among his favorite observations. 
</P>
<P>
 But even more than his personal propensity, Condon's response reflected a 
growing pattern in law enforcement across the country. With medical advances 
giving fetuses ever more social recognition, a number of prosecutors have been 
inspired to treat fetuses as children. In the past decade, they've charged more 
than 160 pregnant substance abusers in 24 states with child neglect and 
distribution of drugs to minors. That appellate courts have overturned 
virtually every conviction on such charges, flatly rejecting the notion of 
applying child protection laws to fetuses, was no discouragement to Condon. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's nice you came in," Condon told Brown and the others sitting before him. 
"But the fact is, you have to come in. There's no patient-doctor privilege on 
this. If you don't report it, it's a crime."  
</P>
<P>
 From there, events moved rather swiftly. 
</P>
<P>
 Together with Charleston Police Chief Reuben Greenberg, Condon called an 
interagency community meeting to "develop a policy as to possible prosecution" 
of pregnant substance abusers. Within three weeks, this task force had hammered 
out its plan. That same day, Police Capt. R.H. Roberts explained it in a memo 
to all central detectives, declaring it "effective immediately." 
</P>
<P>
 When a prenatal patient at the hospital tested positive, she would be 
counseled, usually by Brown, then presented a letter from the solicitor 
offering to defer prosecution if she successfully completed a drug treatment 
program. If she refused, failed to complete or tested positive again, MUSC 
would notify the police, who would issue an arrest warrant. If a patient was 
already at the stage of delivering a child and she or the baby tested positive, 
there would be no such warnings or second chances. The Department of Social 
Services would be notified to take the newborn, and the woman would be arrested 
immediately after her release from the hospital. The hospital contact in all 
cases would be Shirley Brown. If the fetus was "viable," the charges would 
include drug distribution and child neglect. The basis for arrests would not be 
limited to positive drug-screen results; written or oral statements made by the 
patient to "third parties" would suffice.  
</P>
<P>
 There were, it should be said, more than a few expressions of early concern at 
the hospital about this "interagency policy," as it came to be called. A 
medical resident named Birgit Pols expressed discomfort about acting as an arm 
of the law. She was distressed that MUSC was applying this policy only to a 
selected population of indigent blacks; if nurses and doctors screened 
everybody, she knew from studies and private reports, they'd be amazed at how 
many positives they'd get. Kathleen Straight, then nurse manager of the 
neonatal intensive-care unit, told a documentary film team that she thought it 
dangerous to be setting infants against mothers and labeling substance abusers 
and their babies as bad. The medical director of the neonatal intensive-care 
unit, Dr. Celeste Patrick, wrote the Medical University president to point out 
"serious flaws" in the program, including insufficient drug-treatment 
facilities in Charleston and "thinly veiled discrimination against . . . poor 
black women." The hospital's general counsel, Joseph C. Good Jr., worried about 
legal liability as well as other problems. In one letter, he asked the police 
to obtain a subpoena for medical records when they came calling with arrest 
warrants, in order "to protect the Medical University . . . from any 
allegations of breach of confidentiality." In another letter to a senior 
assistant state attorney general, he wrote, "This is not a perfect program. . . 
. I would prefer to have the mothers sign an informed consent for a drug 
screen. . . . I would also prefer the DSS be notified rather than law 
enforcement. . . . The other weakness in this program is that the main 
prosecutions have been against black indigent mothers. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Such moments of hesitation, however, apparently were overwhelmed by the 
enthusiasm of those in charge. In fact, according to neonatologist Patrick, the 
hospital warned doctors that "nonsupport" of the program "may result in 
revocation of our MUSC-provided malpractice insurance." Months later, perhaps 
as a result, Horger could not even recall the plan's early critics. "Not only 
didn't I have a problem with the policy, I was happy with it," he said. "I 
welcomed it. I thought at the time it was right." 
</P>
<P>
 By then, though, the hospital's objections might not have mattered. In joining 
hands with the world of law enforcement, the medical community plainly had lost 
considerable control. By the time MUSC's board of directors officially adopted 
the interagency policy on Nov. 27 -- some six weeks after Capt. Roberts' memo 
had declared it "effective immediately" -- the arrests had already begun, 
without use of subpoenas. 
</P>
<P>
 Pregnant substance abusers' first awareness of the new policy usually came not 
from the hospital but from their television sets. There they began seeing a 
series of public-service announcements featuring the county solicitor. "And not 
only will you live with guilt, you could be arrested," Condon explained in one 
spot. "This is a tragedy you can prevent. . . . If you stay with the 
(treatment) program, you won't be arrested. Wake up from the nightmare. Think 
about your baby first. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Since MUSC was the only high-risk obstetrical center within 50 miles for 
indigents, even those frightened by Condon's words had little choice but to go 
there, particularly if they depended on Medicaid. Once at the hospital, they 
had to sign a general consent for medical treatment that -- without explicitly 
saying so -- allowed, among many other things, a drug screen. Those who tested 
positive soon found themselves receiving visits from Shirley Brown. Those 
unpersuaded by Brown soon found themselves being introduced to a police 
detective. 
</P>
<P>
 It is hard to verify all these women's stories, partly because many are 
homeless or rootless. Those who do come forward do so in the foreign milieu of 
their attorneys' offices, where it is difficult to get past carefully phrased 
statements that often, in their personal details, happen to dovetail nicely 
with the lawyers' general legal arguments. Nonetheless, it seems clear that at 
least some of those arrested were taken from their hospital room hours or days 
after delivering and led to jail in handcuffs and shackles. Others sat in jail 
cells waiting to give birth, then, when in labor, were brought by ambulance, in 
handcuffs and shackles, to the hospital. One tells of being seized in a 
chokehold, near full-term, and escorted forcefully into treatment. Most 
describe impoverished lives supported by food stamps, Aid to Families with 
Dependent Children and, in some instances, prostitution. Several talk of 
backgrounds full of missing husbands, mentally ill parents and early shunting 
to foster homes. Virtually all make a point of calling Brown "nasty" or "cold" 
or "degrading."  
</P>
<P>
 "Shirley Brown and another nurse came to my room and told me my baby tested 
positive," said Ellen Laverne Knight, recalling the day she delivered her third 
child at MUSC in November, 1989. "I gotta sign this and do more tests, they 
said. Next day, they brought my roommate's baby to her, but not mine. Nurse 
Brown was a bitch. She came and said I had to go into a room to talk to 
someone. It was the police. They said I have the right to remain silent. I 
found out I was going to jail. They brought my clothes, they handcuffed me, 
they put a sheet over my hands, they pushed me out in a wheelchair. I spent the 
night in city jail without a sanitary napkin. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Telling this story, Knight was sitting in a lawyer's conference room in 
downtown Charleston, dressed in a business suit. Drug-free after undergoing two 
three-month treatment programs, she spoke with composure, but also with obvious 
bitterness. Yes, she said, she'd done coke two days before her baby's birth. 
But she took care of her children, made them meals. She never got high in her 
home. Depression is what drove her to drugs, depression from being unable to 
find a job, depression from being unable to get her children's father to make 
court-ordered support payments. "It's hard to explain the reality of the 
addict," she said. "When you get the urge, it overrides everything. I 
definitely would have gone to treatment if they'd offered. Instead, they sent 
me to jail and took my baby."  
</P>
<P>
 After watching 10 such arrests in three months, Brown and others at the 
hospital felt compelled to remind the solicitor that they wanted patients going 
to treatment, not jail. Automatically sending women to jail after they'd 
delivered their babies was purely punitive, Brown pointed out. Treatment would 
help after delivery as much as before. Everyone should get warnings, everyone 
should be offered treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 "Amnesty for all" Condon called it, consenting only reluctantly to give 
options to those delivering, instead of hauling them directly to jail. For the 
good of the program, he'd compromise -- but it rankled. 
</P>
<P>
 "The truth is, we have an abysmal record of prosecution in this," Condon said 
later. "If we wanted to be punitive, we would have marched them down, given 
high bonds, packed that jail. If they want to see punitive, we can get 
punitive. This may be punitive in New York, but here, it's a kid-glove 
approach. Practically speaking, they've got to break into jail to get there." 
</P>
<P>
 Not everyone agreed. Agitated word of Charleston's program soon began to 
spread. One day in early 1990, the phone rang in Lynn M. Paltrow's office at 
the ACLU Reproductive Freedom Project in New York. Paltrow, then 31, was 
already one of the nation's leading litigators responding to "fetal rights" 
cases, already one of the most visible warriors in the field of 
reproductive-rights law. 
</P>
<P>
 Her caller wondered: Have you heard what's going on in South Carolina? 
</P>
<P>
 ALTHOUGH THE CHARLESTON POLICY WAS IN SOME ways singular, its underpinnings 
were, to Paltrow, all too familiar. 
</P>
<P>
 The same anti-abortion argument that she'd been fighting for years -- the 
premise that the fetus has rights -- was exactly what she now was hearing 
across the country as justification for punishing pregnant substance abusers. 
Although she didn't think all the prosecutors in these substance-abuse cases 
were necessarily anti-abortion, she still feared the ramifications. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, she reasoned, if it's a crime to endanger the life, health and 
welfare of a fetus, then virtually any action by pregnant women could become 
the basis for criminal prosecution. You could require women to take folic acid, 
you could prevent them from having babies as teen-agers or after 40, you could 
mandate what they eat, how they exercise, whether they have sex.  
</P>
<P>
 Paltrow already had served as co-counsel in virtually all of the most critical 
early prosecutions of pregnant substance abusers. She'd successfully fought 
Jennifer Johnson's prosecution in Florida, Kimberly Hardy's in Michigan, Pamela 
Rae Stewart's in California. Now, in early 1990, South Carolina seemed to be 
presenting a still larger battlefield. This was about even more than women's 
rights or fetal rights. This was about civil rights and racial discrimination. 
This was about sane public-health policy. 
</P>
<P>
 It didn't take Paltrow long to find a host of esteemed professors, doctors and 
medical groups that agreed. The list eventually included such experts in their 
fields as Dr. Barry Zuckerman, chairman of the department of pediatrics at the 
Boston University School of Medicine and Boston City Hospital, and Dr. Jay 
Katz, professor emeritus of law, medicine and psychiatry at the Yale University 
Law School. In the mound of essays, declarations and studies on Paltrow's desk, 
these specialists offered all manner of objection to Charleston's policy. 
</P>
<P>
 The policy, they argued, violates the right to privacy in medical information, 
the right to refuse medical treatment, the right to procreate, the right to 
equal protection under the 14th Amendment. The policy forces doctors to be cops 
and gives the judgment of doctors -- or nurse Brown -- the force of law. The 
policy treats drug addiction as a crime rather than an illness and allows for 
no relapses, which are expected at treatment centers. The policy frays the 
doctor's relationship with patients. The policy violates all notions of 
informed consent. The policy is tantamount to human research, without the 
required approvals. The policy, no matter what criteria are used, targets poor 
blacks by screening only at an indigent center such as MUSC. The policy leads 
society down a slippery slope -- if you're going after women for harming their 
fetuses, what about drinkers and smokers, whose behavior produces, overall, 
greater and more lasting harm each year than cocaine users?  
</P>
<P>
 Above all, the academics and doctors assembled by Paltrow argued that the 
policy, while mandating treatment if you want to avoid jail, ignores the fact 
that appropriate treatment programs for pregnant addicts just don't exist in 
the Charleston area. By "appropriate," they mean outpatient programs that 
provide transportation and day-care and long-term residential programs where 
mothers can live with their children, isolated from the type of potentially 
violent male addicts they're all too familiar with. 
</P>
<P>
 On this point there can be little dispute. Until the recent opening of the 
Sojourner Center for Women, which serves only one ZIP code in the city, there 
was no outpatient program in Charleston that offered day-care or direct 
door-to-door transportation; there is still no residential program specifically 
for women and their children. The Department of Alcohol and Other Drug Abuse 
Services (formerly the Charleston County Substance Abuse Commission), where 
MUSC directs most pregnant substance abusers, counsels all kinds of abusers, 
often in group therapy sessions. MUSC itself, in applying for grants, has 
expressed "serious concern" that needed services "are not available" at the 
hospital or in the Charleston community. Counselors obliged to ask anxious, 
depressed mothers to leave their children and ride buses an hour or more across 
town readily confirm such concerns. Women will come, the counselors claim, only 
if they feel they and their children are safe. Otherwise, threats and coercion 
will just drive them away. 
</P>
<P>
 That, some believe, is precisely what's been happening in Charleston. In a 
South Carolina medical journal article, at various professional gatherings and 
even in Condon's resume, the trio of Brown, Horger and Condon have hailed a 
"marked" decrease in positive drug screens -- from 24 to four or five a month 
-- but specialists such as Zuckerman think this MUSC report "deeply flawed." 
How do they know the hospital hasn't merely driven most substance abusers away? 
</P>
<P>
 It is hard to judge all these arguments. It is true, for example, that 
Charleston is targeting poor blacks by screening only at MUSC -- but it is also 
true that the 1991 South Carolina Prevalence Study found black women nearly six 
times more likely to use cocaine than white women, and women without medical 
insurance 17 to 18 times more likely. While it is true that more appropriate 
treatment programs are needed, it is also true that no one really knows if such 
programs would attract all the pregnant substance abusers who now stay away. 
Whether to talk about a "failure of personal responsibility" or "the disease of 
addiction" is in some way, finally, a question of philosophy, not fact.  
</P>
<P>
 The central argument against coercion echoes that of many prominent medical 
organizations. The American Medical Assn., the American Academy of Pediatrics, 
the American Nurses Assn., the American Public Health Assn., the March of Dimes 
-- in recent years they have all ringingly condemned the national trend toward 
use of coercion and legal threats. "Criminal sanctions or civil liability for 
harmful behavior by the pregnant woman toward her fetus are inappropriate," 
resolves the AMA. "The public must be assured of non-punitive access to 
comprehensive health care which will meet the needs of the substance-abusing 
pregnant woman," proclaims the AAP. "The threat of criminal prosecution is 
counterproductive," declares the ANA. 
</P>
<P>
 As the debate in Charleston has developed, such statements have meant more and 
more to Paltrow, for they've helped in her critical effort to keep the matter 
from being framed as a collision between women's rights and fetal rights. This 
is the tricky heart of the controversy. 
</P>
<P>
 Personally, Paltrow's heart goes out to pregnant substance abusers; having 
grown up on Long Island watching her parents regularly march for social 
justice, she is one of those inclined to talk about "the disease of addiction" 
and "the burdens of poverty." But she knows these substance abusers are 
enormously unpopular with others. She knows that, as impressive as the 
intellectual arguments might be in favor of women's reproductive rights, they 
pale for many in the face of a sickly newborn twitching from a cocaine rush. 
She knows she'd lose support, even among those committed to women's rights, if 
people felt forced to choose between pregnant substance abusers and their 
babies. 
</P>
<P>
 The medical community's policy statements provide Paltrow with a way to avoid 
this perilous choice. "Even if you care only about the baby, even if you don't 
give a damn about the mother, you should still oppose Charleston's policy," 
Paltrow finds herself able to argue. "All evidence is, this frightens them away 
from prenatal health care that's good for the baby. You can't punish the woman 
without punishing the fetus. You need to come up with policies that help both. 
Threats don't make sense. Jail doesn't make sense." 
</P>
<P>
 That sentiment is, in a sense, the heart of her case. To challenge 
Charleston's policy in court, however, Paltrow needed not just experts and 
arguments. She also needed clients who'd actually been prosecuted. So she sent 
feelers to South Carolina attorneys, and she waited. Not until early last year 
-- by then she'd left the ACLU to co-found the Center for Reproductive Law & 
Policy in New York -- did Paltrow locate the women she wanted. 
</P>
<P>
 One was Crystal Ferguson, a tall, thin, outspoken 31-year-old African American 
who had not taken kindly to her treatment at MUSC. She lived in a trailer with 
two sons, 10 and 11, and a daughter, 2. She was happy to join a civil suit; she 
thought someone should pay for what they'd done.  
</P>
<P>
 She'd been using drugs when she became pregnant with her little girl, she told 
Paltrow and Susan Dunn, a local Charleston attorney who'd joined the case. But 
she hadn't considered herself an addict. She thought she could stop using, she 
thought she had it under control. She went to a local health clinic for 
prenatal care, where she denied drug use, since she'd seen the solicitor 
talking on TV and was afraid of being arrested. Instead, she tried to overcome 
her addiction herself, but couldn't. At 32 weeks, she was referred to MUSC, 
where she tested positive for cocaine. You go to a residential substance-abuse 
program for two weeks, Shirley Brown informed her, or you get arrested. At 
first, Ferguson agreed, but when she went home to pack, "I saw the situation my 
kids were in. There was no one to take care of them. Someone had stolen our 
food stamps and my unemployment check while I was at the hospital. There was no 
way I was going to leave my children for two weeks, knowing the environment 
they were in." She called the hospital and asked if there was a place she could 
go with her sons. Told there was not, she refused treatment and avoided 
prenatal care the last two months of pregnancy. She returned to the hospital 
only to deliver a full-term baby girl -- and to once again test positive for 
cocaine.  
</P>
<P>
 The other woman was Theresa Joseph, a 35-year-old African American who came to 
be known in court papers anonymously as Monica Roe. Small and flashy looking, 
with light skin and a Yankee accent, she was more reluctant to fight than 
Ferguson; she was more inclined to disappear than stand her ground. Yet she, 
too, was angry. Supported by AFDC and disability payments, she had a 
10-year-old son who lived with her and other children living elsewhere.  
</P>
<P>
 She'd used drugs during her pregnancy, she told Paltrow and Dunn, and avoided 
prenatal care entirely because Condon's TV announcements frightened her. She'd 
ended up at MUSC anyway because of a severe foot infection. There, Brown, 
learning of her history of drug use, came to visit. Joseph had heard about 
Brown, had heard people talk about her as if she were a witch. Brown told her 
she'd lose her baby and go to jail if she didn't go into treatment. Afraid of 
being arrested, she left the hospital that night -- just put on her clothes and 
ran out. Later, realizing she needed help, she returned to the hospital to ask 
Brown for entry into a treatment program, but they gave her an appointment for 
3 1/2 weeks later. By then, she'd lost her nerve and didn't keep the 
appointment. She next came to MUSC in pre-term labor at 7 1/2 months. They 
didn't let her see her baby after it was born. The baby, Shirley Brown told 
her, had tested positive for cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
 In both cases, MUSC had called the police, who'd arrested, handcuffed and led 
the women to jail, Ferguson from her home, Joseph from her hospital bed. 
Ferguson felt like she was dying; Joseph screamed and cried as they led her 
away. At bond hearings, David Schwacke -- Condon's successor as solicitor -- 
had charged them with distribution of drugs to a minor. Ferguson stayed in jail 
11 hours, Joseph three weeks.  
</P>
<P>
 "I now understand more about addiction," Ferguson said in an affidavit to the 
court. "I was a sick person. I made a mistake, but MUSC did not make it better. 
The staff was very insensitive, especially nurse Shirley Brown. . . . I was 
just another black drug addict to them. . . . They locked me up like I was a 
mass murderer. If someone had offered me a program where I could have brought 
my children, I would have gone. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Getting Ferguson and Joseph's cases dropped would prove to be the easiest of 
Paltrow's legal tasks. Few South Carolina judges were buying the attempt to 
treat fetuses as children; in 1992, a state appellate court had tossed out the 
child-neglect conviction of a pregnant substance abuser, basically ruling it a 
nonexistent charge. So when Paltrow and public defender Ted Phillips -- 
supported by the American Public Health Assn. and 17 other medical and civil 
rights groups -- moved in May, 1993, to quash the distribution charges against 
Joseph and Ferguson, Schwacke surrendered without a fight. By agreeing to 
dismiss the charges against those two and rescind the bench warrants on five 
others similarly charged, Schwacke hoped to preserve the Charleston policy's 
options and avoid an even worse legal precedent. 
</P>
<P>
 Paltrow wasn't finished, though. In October, she filed a $3-million 
class-action complaint seeking compensatory and punitive damages as well as a 
preliminary injunction "to prevent defendants from continuing to conduct an 
unconstitutional experiment on African-American women. . . ." In January, she 
filed a formal complaint to the National Institutes of Health Office for 
Protection from Research Risks, accusing MUSC -- because it published a medical 
journal article -- of "conducting research on human subjects, including our 
clients," without the review and approval required by the National Research 
Act. In February, the federal government, perhaps taking the cue, revealed it 
had opened a civil-rights investigation of the MUSC program. Civil rights 
investigator Roosevelt H. Freeman started knocking on doors and asking 
questions in Charleston. By then, four more women had come forward, signed 
affidavits and joined the lawsuit.  
</P>
<P>
 For the moment, Paltrow seemed on a roll. The hospital's medical staff was 
reeling and ducking. That week, several MUSC doctors declined invitations to 
testify in the state capital about pregnant substance abusers, while others 
didn't even return phone calls from the hospital's own public-relations office. 
 
</P>
<P>
 Soon enough, though, a certain resistance to Paltrow's attack became apparent. 
Soon enough, the abiding aversion in the South Carolina low country to pregnant 
substance abusers, and to folks from out of state delivering moral instruction, 
began to emerge. When the federal civil rights investigator asked the county 
solicitor to document everything he said -- every trifling fact, every off-hand 
statement -- more than a few began to grumble.  
</P>
<P>
 "That's not the way it's done down here," Schwacke later observed. "Down here, 
people trust each other." 
</P>
<P>
 CHARLESTON IS A UNIQUE place, at once civilized and disinclined to embrace 
imported notions. On the winding cobblestone and brick roads of this gracious 
but insular Southern town of 80,000, dozens of grand Colonial and antebellum 
homes are still occupied by direct descendants of the families that built them 
in the early 1700s. Cannons on the East Battery still aim across the confluence 
of the Cooper and Ashley rivers at Ft. Sumter, as they did at the start of the 
Civil War. This is a town that was flourishing well before the Revolution under 
management of a sophisticated aristocracy, leaders who grew wealthy in the 
rice, indigo and slave trades, leaders who were the first to fire on and secede 
from the Union.  
</P>
<P>
 References here are to "our cocaine problem," not "our interagency policy 
problem." Charleston's policy is still in place; Shirley Brown still requires 
women who test positive to choose, sometimes on the spot, between treatment and 
immediate arrest.  
</P>
<P>
 "There's no controversy here," announces Reuben Greenberg, Charleston's 
purposefully provocative police chief, as he paces about his office, eyes 
glinting. "Only California types and ACLU types are bothered by this, and no 
one cares about those types here. They have no power here." 
</P>
<P>
 That surely is overstatement, but not by much. The policy's supporters are 
many, and they are little swayed by Paltrow's pile of briefs, reports and 
affidavits. They are more impressed by the fact that of some 200 women facing 
prosecution under the policy, 154 went to treatment and only two of the 46 
arrested actually received sentences. They remain impressed even when told that 
no one really knows what happened to those women once in treatment.  
</P>
<P>
 How can you say we're driving patients from prenatal care, they ask, when most 
substance abusers never even come for prenatal care? How can you say women 
don't go to drug treatment because existing programs are "inappropriate," when 
most haven't even tried them once, haven't even seen what they're like? How can 
you say doctors shouldn't cooperate with the law, when they already must report 
everything from gunshot wounds and rapes to child abuse? How can you compare 
cocaine to alcohol, when one is legal and one illegal? How can you say 
cocaine's impact isn't lasting when its enormous cost drains a world of 
shrinking medical resources? 
</P>
<P>
 It is not hard to see why this last point draws particular attention from the 
policy's supporters. The average initial hospital visit for a cocaine-exposed 
baby costs $24,000 at MUSC, compared to $500 for a normal delivery. One 
drug-exposed baby stayed a year, costing $731,000; then his mother delivered 
another drug-exposed infant who stayed four months and cost $167,132. What with 
developmental follow-up, special education and foster care, one federal report 
calculates the total cost of each drug-exposed baby at $1 million.  
</P>
<P>
 When not talking about such cost issues, Charles Condon focuses on the theme 
of personal responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
 "Are we really to blame society?" he asks. "These women want day care and free 
transportation, but who's taking care of their kids when they're on coke? Who's 
providing transportation to go get the drugs? Suddenly they're supermoms who 
won't abandon their kids. That these two women want a South Carolina jury to 
give them $3 million for what happened to them. . . . It's frightening. If we 
can't act in situations like this, when can we act?" 
</P>
<P>
 Equally adamant is Police Chief Greenberg, who readily addresses the charges 
of racial discrimination. A black Jew (by way of his Russian immigrant 
grandfather), a former Berkeley activist, a onetime sailor, rodeo bull rider 
and college professor, he is a man given far more to irreverence than Southern 
gentility. He is also a man given regularly to expressing impatience with "all 
that psychological sociological crap" that blames criminal activity on 
impoverished social conditions or bad parenting. Once, at a drug forum in 
Washington, D.C., after listening to Lynn Paltrow explain that cocaine wasn't 
permanently damaging, he rushed up to her, got right in her face, even though 
they'd never met. "How can you say that?" he demanded. "Cocaine mothers are 
killing their babies; how can you say that?" 
</P>
<P>
 Sitting in his office another day, he explained: "I see hordes of people, 
mainly black, walk around in a daze. The drug crisis has a tremendous impact on 
the black community. I wouldn't care if it were all blacks who got arrested. 
This policy is helping black kids. The racial aspects don't bother me. God, 
this whole political correctness thing. . . ." With that, Greenberg jumped up 
and fell on his knees. "I pray for when the majority of blacks in jail are 
there for tax evasion," he said, raising his arms to the ceiling. "Then we will 
have made it -- then we'll be part of the American scene." 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, those in Charleston and elsewhere who support the policy just 
don't buy Paltrow's effort to close off the fetal-rights debate. To them a 
mother and a fetus's interests are not always the same. To them, what's most 
important here is not abortion rights or women's rights or civil rights. To 
them, what's most important here, finally, is the health of the child when 
born.  
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not a lawyer," Shirley Brown said with a shrug. "I have two patients, 
mother and unborn child. One patient can talk, one can't, and people on drugs 
don't always make the best decision for themselves. Sometimes you've got to 
choose between your two patients. We took the stance that you've got to choose 
for the unborn patient." 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking these words, Brown was sitting in the hospital's public-relations 
office, having arrived 90 minutes late for an interview. She blamed her delay 
on the need to deal with an agitated addict high on heroin and cocaine. The 
legal complaints and news media commotion, she said, "create an ominous 
portrait and make patients very apprehensive. You take people using drugs, who 
already are afraid, and make them more afraid. This is making my job harder." 
</P>
<P>
 The mother of a 19-year-old daughter, Brown is an earnest woman in her early 
40s, born and raised in small-town South Carolina, who enjoys piloting a 
private plane around the state in her off hours "to see the world from a 
different, more peaceful perspective." Watching her march into a room with 
self-assured composure, hearing her speak evenly and directly, even the more 
generous involved in the Charleston controversy have felt inspired to call her 
"steely."  
</P>
<P>
 Now, however, she sounded more wounded than belligerent. 
</P>
<P>
 She was raised in a religious home, Brown explained; she was raised in church. 
Her parents -- her dad had a small insurance agency, her mom worked in a bank 
-- loved her, loved her two sisters. Sundays, the whole family would get 
together with her mom's seven brothers and sisters, the gatherings full of 
children, the cousins like siblings to her. Family mattered, she believed. 
Children are a precious asset, children are our future, children are our 
dreams. She didn't understand this furor, she didn't understand why people 
thought her a witch, she didn't understand why people didn't want to help 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 "You start to talk with care and compassion," she said of her visits with 
patients. "But you must make them understand. So you tell them -- get 
treatment, don't get arrested, I don't want you arrested. But if you continue 
using drugs, you . . . will . . . be . . . arrested. I don't yell. I also don't 
say" -- here Brown momentarily adopts a soft, cooing voice -- " 'don't worry 
about it.' I tell them some have been arrested. That's why they get upset. If 
you're on drugs, and you're told you will go to jail if you don't stop, and you 
don't want to stop, then the person telling you is mean."  
</P>
<P>
 Brown blinked hard, her face flushed. "How would you feel?" she continued. 
"How would you feel? I've had patients looking through their pocketbook to get 
a card from that attorney (Lynn Paltrow) to sue me. 'You can't make me go into 
treatment,' they say. 'You're violating my rights. I'm going to call this 
attorney.' How'd you like it if you were threatened with a lawsuit each time 
you walked into a room?" 
</P>
<P>
 After two hours of conversation, her visitor rose to leave, but Brown did not 
want to stop. 
</P>
<P>
 "No patient was publicly seen being arrested at MU," she said. "It was always 
done low-key and quietly. Plainclothes officer, cloth over the handcuffs, out 
the back door, unannounced. . . . We're trying to help pregnant women. . . . I 
don't know anyone who's perfect." 
</P>
<P>
 Her visitor now at the door, Brown still couldn't let go. 
</P>
<P>
 "How would you like it? I can combat the truth, but this, what they're saying 
about me. . . . Once said, there's no recovering. . . . Do you see that bad, 
mean monster nurse Brown? Is that what you see? Does it look like I have horns? 
Is that what you see?" 
</P>
<P>
 "THIS IS NOT YOUR GARDEN VARIETY case," a visibly disgruntled U.S. District 
Judge C. Weston Houck muttered during his first morning of exposure to the 
various arguments in the case titled Crystal Ferguson and Monica Roe vs. City 
of Charleston et. al. "This is going to be a complicated constitutional case." 
</P>
<P>
 That was on Wednesday, Feb. 16, at a hearing called to consider Paltrow's 
motion for a preliminary injunction. Charles Condon and Shirley Brown were 
sitting at the defendants' table, Paltrow and Susan Dunn and two other lawyers 
at the plaintiffs' table. Within minutes, it was apparent that Paltrow's 
momentum had hit something of a brick wall in Judge Houck. 
</P>
<P>
 Called to speak first, Paltrow, having spent hours the night before preparing, 
rose clutching a legal pad full of notes. The mission she faced was daunting; 
to get an injunction, she needed to prove her two particular clients faced 
imminent, irreparable danger. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would like to begin . . . by explaining what we're not asking for today," 
she said. "We are not asking this court to enjoin MUSC from counseling its 
pregnant patients -- " 
</P>
<P>
 That's about as far as she got. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tell me what you are asking for," Judge Houck interrupted. MUSC does "a lot 
of things. And I can't go down to everything. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Paltrow tried again. "All that we are asking this court to do is to restore 
(MUSC) to what it is supposed to be -- a health-care facility, not a conduit to 
jail -- " 
</P>
<P>
 "Look, look, look, look, look, look" the judge interrupted again. "Tell me 
what you want. . . . I don't need all that surplusage . . . OK?" 
</P>
<P>
 Paltrow tried shifting from description to legal argument, but that didn't 
work either. 
</P>
<P>
 "How is that going to the failure for me to grant relief?" Houck asked. "How 
is that going to cause your clients irreparable harm?"  
</P>
<P>
 Paltrow tried summarizing her claims. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's what the lawsuit is all about," Houck barked. "That's been done. I 
can't stop that by a preliminary injunction." 
</P>
<P>
 Paltrow tried citing case precedents. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just hand me those cases," Houck growled. "But I mean, it doesn't do any good 
for you to read cases here in court. I can't read them now and hear your 
argument as well."  
</P>
<P>
 As the day wore on, it grew harder and harder to ignore the good ol' boy 
routines. The more the judge addressed Bobby Hull, local attorney for the 
hospital, the more their voices thickened into a distinct Southern drawl. The 
term "fussin' at" began appearing with some frequency, as in Hull's suggestion 
that "it's the state they all fussin' at, not the individuals." (By suing MUSC, 
a state institution, Paltrow is effectively suing South Carolina.) Although the 
judge called the hospital's lawyer "Mr. Hull," he could not bring himself to 
address Paltrow by name or even, at times, look directly at her. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe there is some evidence the goal of this program has been achieved 
to some extent," Judge Houck said, upon finally revealing that he was going to 
deny Paltrow's motion for an injunction. "I do believe if the program 
continues, some mothers who are addicted and in prenatal care will not continue 
treatment. Then I must conclude that the discontinuation of the program is 
going to cause at least one or more children to be born with addiction to 
drugs. . . . That is very serious harm. . . . The public undoubtedly is 
interested in its institutions not violating the constitutional rights of 
citizens. . . . I also believe that the public interest of this state is 
focused now, more than probably at any other time, on drugs and (their) 
effects. . . . It may be that the public interest is not well founded. . . . It 
may be that they should be more concerned about the deprivation of 
constitutional rights of the plaintiff, but I really don't think that's the 
case. I think the public is concerned about children who, through no fault of 
their own . . . are conceived by a mother who is addicted to drugs. . . . To 
avoid that . . . is of great public interest. . . ."  
</P>
<P>
 Paltrow's obvious dismay and Condon's satisfied smile as they left the hearing 
told the whole story. There were many months to go, many more chances coming 
for Paltrow to persuade and educate; at a second hearing in early June, Paltrow 
would in fact prevail on several procedural matters. Still, if not readily 
apparent before, it was now: No matter how much you debate the issues and 
assemble the experts, this case was not, in the end, only about right or wrong, 
good or bad, legal or illegal, moral or immoral. This case was also very much 
about political will -- of what the public wants and will support.  
</P>
<P>
 Condon, for one, understands this quite well. 
</P>
<P>
 Just last summer, after all, Charleston residents -- including Mayor Joseph 
Riley Jr., and Police Chief Greenberg -- fought fiercely against locating a 
residential drug- and alcohol-treatment center near the city, even though it 
had federal funding and was to include precisely the type of residential 
facility that specialists believe would attract pregnant substance abusers with 
children. Expressing concern about the "frequent mental dysfunction" of 
substance abusers, noting that "even the best treatment programs are only 
partially effective," Greenberg declared that he "would not like to see this 
facility located in my neighborhood or the proposed location." 
</P>
<P>
 By the time everyone finally agreed last fall to build the facility near the 
MUSC complex, it was clear that the dispute, although ostensibly over location, 
was also being driven by a more fundamental fear and animosity. "There was a 
great resentment against people who don't follow rules ending up in a better 
position than those who do," is how Condon put it. "Of people pulling the cart 
being told what to do by those in the cart."  
</P>
<P>
 Walking to the courthouse from his law office, Condon began to explain, with 
all the relish of a pragmatic political scientist, the principles underlying 
such community resistance.  
</P>
<P>
 "First, be cognizant that it takes taxpayer money to pay for these programs," 
he advised. "That's the real world. So they must meet harsh tests: Are they 
necessary? Bare bones? You're handing out free food, shelter, access to better 
medical plans than we have. I'm not at all against these programs, but you 
can't get resources for them; there's not great support in this country for 
them. That's the real world, just like there's not enough political will to 
move after pregnant women who use alcohol or cigarettes. There is, though, a 
political basis for this interagency program. Leaders can take a position 
against crack. Our legal system reflects our cultural mores. That's our system. 
That's the real world. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Condon stopped in mid-sentence, at the moment he reached the television 
cameras waiting at the courthouse steps. Instantly, he turned from his 
companion and hit his cue. 
</P>
<P>
 "The left-wing ACLU doesn't represent the American people," he began, leaning 
into the microphone. "The left-wing ACLU doesn't represent the people of South 
Carolina. MUSC deserves an award. If the plaintiff prevails, in effect we'd be 
legalizing the use of crack cocaine during pregnancy. . . ." Staring into the 
camera, Condon posed the enduring question that so grips Charleston: "Who is 
speaking for the babies in this courtroom?" he asked. "Who is speaking for the 
babies?" 
</P>
<P>
 Then Condon turned back to his private conversation. "Tell Lynn thanks for 
suing me," he smiled, as he walked into the courthouse. "Running in South 
Carolina for attorney general, the best thing you can have happen is to be sued 
by the ACLU."

THE AMAZINGLY SIMPLE, INEXPLICABLE THERAPY THAT JUST MIGHT WORK; IS EMDR 
PSYCHOLOGY'S MAGIC WAND OR JUST SOME HOCUS POCUS? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Nancy Wartik, Nancy Wartik is a Brooklyn-based freelance writer and 
contributing editor to American Health magazine. Her last piece for this 
magazine was about in-vitro fertilization. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The videotape I'm watching is making me cry. The woman in it, in her 60s and 
neatly dressed, speaks in a self-possessed manner and without self-pity, 
despite the nasal-gastric tube that runs from her nose to her stomach. She's 
talking with Colorado Springs psychologist Robert Tinker, a sympathetic 
off-screen presence. Found to have oral cancer two years ago, Mary Sarner is a 
nurse and has no illusions about her prognosis. That's not what's upsetting her 
at the moment, however. 
</P>
<P>
 Seven months ago, when her cancer flared up again, her husband, Charlie, left 
her, telling her, "I can't watch you die anymore." Sick and despairing, Sarner 
planned to kill herself. A friend intervened and talked Charlie into returning 
home. But now Sarner is facing the prospect of new surgery. Terrified that 
Charlie will leave again, she's feeling desperately hurt and alone. 
</P>
<P>
 Tinker speaks up then, describing a new psychotherapeutic procedure -- known 
by the bulky name of Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing -- he plans 
to try. It was developed, he says, as a treatment for trauma and may work 
because it "ties in with REM (rapid eye movement) sleep, a time when we process 
the day's emotions." Some events are so painful, "they overwhelm REM's ability 
to process the emotions." This therapy may be effective, he explains, because 
it's an intensified form of REM. 
</P>
<P>
 He asks Sarner to visualize the moment when Charlie left and to recall the 
accompanying negative thoughts and feelings ("I'm nothing, I'm no good -- pain, 
lonesomeness, terrible hurt"). Then, holding his fingers about 18 inches from 
her face, Tinker begins moving them back and forth in windshield-wiper fashion. 
Sarner's eyes track the movement, as if observing a Ping-Pong game. On the 
first go-round, which lasts less than a minute, nothing much happens. The 
second time, Sarner begins to sob. "I don't want to watch anymore," she cries 
out, as if seeing a vision beyond the moving fingers. Yet she keeps her eyes 
moving, until Tinker has her close them briefly and breathe deeply.  
</P>
<P>
 "What do you get?" he asks. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hurt from head to toe," she responds. 
</P>
<P>
 Again he has her think of Charlie's desertion, while his hand zigzags back and 
forth. This time, as she watches, her face changes. "It's gone," she says when 
Tinker stops. "It's just an old picture now. It's amazing. I don't have to hurt 
anymore. If Charlie wants to leave, it's his choice." She sits up straighter, 
more relaxed. "Oh gosh. I can do this, I'm going to be strong," she says. "When 
I die, I'm going to die with dignity. If Charlie doesn't want to see it, that's 
OK." 
</P>
<P>
 There are more rounds of hand movements. "I want to go deep-sea fishing, start 
calling my friends. Charlie, I can have fun without you." 
</P>
<P>
 I'VE JUST SEEN A DEMONSTRATION, TAPED DURING THE COURSE OF A recent study, of 
what's probably the most controversial psychotherapy in use today. In 1989, the 
first articles about an improbable-sounding technique for treating 
post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) appeared in the psychological literature. 
PTSD, an anxiety disorder with a multitude of mental and physical symptoms, 
strikes after an ordeal such as rape, combat, child abuse or natural disaster 
and can permanently scar a psyche. But with little more than a wave of the 
hand, it seemed, Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) could 
undo trauma's tormenting effects in a remarkably short time, sometimes in a 
single session. 
</P>
<P>
 The procedure, originated by psychologist Francine Shapiro, then a California 
graduate student, is fairly straightforward. A patient focuses on the traumatic 
memory, then follows the back-and-forth movement of a therapist's fingers. That 
may lead to a new, related image, which the patient will focus on during 
another set of eye movements. Vivid memories often surface and many patients 
feel as if they're reliving the original, devastating event. As thick and fast 
as images arise during the course of what's usually a 90-minute session, 
they're "processed" with the eye movements until a patient's painful feelings 
are replaced by happier ones.  
</P>
<P>
 Word of EMDR rippled quickly through the psychological community. In some 
Veterans Administration clinics, the procedure reportedly helped turn things 
around for Vietnam vets who'd once been impossible to help. Psychologists use 
it to treat survivors of Florida's Hurricane Andrew in 1992 and those who 
couldn't function well after the Northridge earthquake this year. Proponents 
say thousands have benefited from EMDR.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's like vacuuming, it sucks all the anxiety out and it's done," says a 
Hughes Aircraft staff engineer who left town after the January quake. Working 
on her doctoral dissertation at the time, she was afraid to return until, by 
chance, she hooked up with a therapist who practiced EMDR.  
</P>
<P>
 Although not widely known outside mental-health circles, EMDR is apparently 
headed for the mainstream. About 7,000 therapists in several countries, 
including nearly 2,500 in California, have been trained in the procedure, and 
many are testing EMDR to treat ills ranging from schizophrenia to eating 
disorders. "I'm committed to establishing this as a valid treatment," says Yale 
psychiatrist Dr. Steve Lazrove. "I've seen it work with people who, well, I 
don't know how I'd do it if we didn't have EMDR. We'd probably spend years. 
This way, we just blow through and go on." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet even as EMDR spreads so rapidly, there's little hard evidence that it 
works any better than existing psychotherapies. "A long list of treatments come 
and go in psychology," says Harvard psychiatrist Dr. Roger Pitman, who 
coordinates research and development at the VA Medical Center in Manchester, 
N.H. "Transactional analysis. Primal scream. I'm OK, you're OK. There are a lot 
of fads and only time can tell which will hold up." 
</P>
<P>
 Not surprisingly, EMDR is splitting the psychological community into warring 
camps. Some question the zeal with which it's being promoted and marketed by 
Shapiro -- in two-day training seminars around the country -- before its 
efficacy is proved. "It's kind of scary that EMDR is getting so much exposure 
when the people involved in marketing it don't have the research to 
substantiate it," says psychologist Susan Solomon, who heads the violence and 
traumatic stress research branch at the National Institute of Mental Health in 
Maryland. "Trying things is not uncommon, but talking about them as if it's 
established that they work is different. This is a major business and it's 
caught on in a big way."  
</P>
<P>
 But most psychotherapies don't come backed with proven track records. And EMDR 
advocates in the trenches are disinclined to wait until all the data is in. 
"This is the most helpful technique I've ever used for dealing with trauma," 
says Tinker. "If therapists have used a variety of approaches and suddenly come 
on one which provides outcomes that go way beyond what they've obtained before, 
they're not likely to take the stance 'I won't use this until hard evidence 
appears in the literature.' Their experience is the hard evidence they need." 
</P>
<P>
 FRANCINE SHAPIRO WAS 39 AND UNKNOWN TO THE PSYCHOLOGY world when she developed 
EMDR. At the time, she was about to start her doctoral dissertation at the 
Professional School for Psychological Studies, a non-accredited San Diego 
university that closed three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a spring day in 1987, and Shapiro was strolling in a park in Los Gatos, 
outside San Jose. She was musing about something troubling, though she no 
longer recalls what. Suddenly, she says, "I noticed those thoughts were 
disappearing. When I brought them back, they didn't have the same charge. I 
thought, 'What am I doing? What's causing them to disappear?' I had no idea. So 
I said, 'Let me just pay attention.' And I found that when that kind of thought 
went through my mind, my eyes started moving rapidly and the thought shifted 
from consciousness. So then I did it deliberately. I brought up something 
upsetting and did the eye movements. And the same thing happened." The effect 
intrigued her, and she began to investigate further. 
</P>
<P>
 Shapiro is recounting this story at a natural-food stand not far from her 
home, about 30 minutes south of San Francisco. She's taken a break from 
finishing an EMDR textbook she's writing that's to be published this year. An 
intense woman little given to small talk, Shapiro radiates a missionary zeal 
about spreading the news of her discovery and is impatient with debates over 
its merit. "What we're doing is extremely important," she says. "A lot of 
people are suffering. Unless we keep our eye on the suffering, it's all 
politics." 
</P>
<P>
 New York chutzpah, Shapiro has said, fuels her persistent campaign to bring 
EMDR to the world's attention. She grew up in Brooklyn, the daughter of an auto 
mechanic and a housewife. At 30, she was married and teaching English in the 
New York City public schools while working on a literature doctorate. Then she 
was found to have cancer (she prefers not to discuss what kind). Though cured 
of the illness in 1978, she learned all she could about the mind's role in 
promoting sickness or health. "The message coming through to me was that cancer 
was a stress disease," she says. "I shifted my attention from literature to 
what would have an effect on stress and ended up in psychology." 
</P>
<P>
 A year later, Shapiro left New York and her marriage for the New Age mecca of 
the West. In California, she began exploring meditation, hypnosis and other 
non-traditional therapies. "I took every alternative workshop I could find," 
she says. "My question was, 'What works, and how can I get it out to people?' " 
</P>
<P>
 She returned to school for her psychology degree -- "and then I took a walk in 
the park." Once she'd made the observation about eye movements, Shapiro began 
buttonholing acquaintances to test it. Results were successful enough that she 
started a study that became her dissertation. The 22 Mendocino County 
volunteers were Vietnam vets or victims of rape or sexual abuse who suffered 
symptoms of post-traumatic stress: nightmares, flashbacks or so-called 
intrusive thoughts. Shapiro found that after she gave them a single EMDR 
session, the volunteers' anxiety levels dropped, their symptoms diminished and 
positive thoughts about themselves increased.  
</P>
<P>
 Shapiro termed her therapy "eye movement desensitization," acknowledging her 
debt to the behavior therapy known as systematic desensitization. Behavior 
therapies work on the premise that self-defeating patterns of action are 
learned and can be unlearned. Systematic desensitization, developed in the 
1950s by eminent behavorial therapist Dr. Joseph Wolpe, helps people overcome 
anxieties or phobias by teaching them deep-muscle relaxation techniques. Then 
they are incrementally exposed -- through imagery and real-life confrontation 
-- to the object or event that they fear. In essence, Shapiro was substituting 
eye movements for relaxation as she tried to desensitize subjects to past pain. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1988, Shapiro approached Wolpe with her findings. "She told me she had a 
remarkable new treatment," says Wolpe, now a psychology and psychiatry 
professor at Pepperdine University. "I was skeptical, but decided to try it 
out. It was effective in some minor context and that encouraged me to 
continue." 
</P>
<P>
 What he saw made him a believer. "There are certain cases where eye movement 
desensitization is dramatically rapid, cases that, as far as I know, are 
unparalleled," he says. "I published one study of a woman who had been 
traumatized by a rape nine years ago. She had not improved at all with other 
therapy. With this, she was virtually cured after seven sessions. It was 
striking." 
</P>
<P>
 Wolpe's stamp of approval gave EMDR a certain psychotherapeutic cachet while 
Shapiro continued to present her findings to researchers at universities and VA 
centers across the country. In 1989, she accepted a position at the Mental 
Research Institute, a training and research facility for therapists in Palo 
Alto, where she's now a senior research fellow. She refined EMDR, splicing in 
bits and pieces from other therapeutic traditions such as cognitive therapy or 
relaxation techniques. She changed her concept of the therapy from a behavioral 
model to one that was neurophysiologically based. The eye movements, she 
proposed, stimulated "an inherent information processing system that we all 
have that's geared to take dysfunctional information and to work it through to 
an adaptive resolution." What had started as EMD became EMDR, to reflect 
Shapiro's feeling that the eye movements were helping patients "reprocess" old 
pain into something positive. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990, Shapiro began offering training seminars for licensed mental-health 
clinicians. As a speaker, Shapiro is compelling: funny, personable, never at a 
loss for words. And the vision she presents is alluring. For those frustrated 
at the slow, backsliding process of helping an individual achieve change, she 
offers the possibility of rapid metamorphosis -- as fast as one to four 
sessions of treatment. In place of the hit-or-miss style of talk therapy many 
therapists practice, she offers an eight-stage formulaic method that has the 
potential to help a therapist plunge straight to the depths of a patient's pain 
and exorcise it. 
</P>
<P>
 Her message found eager listeners. "There's a growing recognition among 
mental-health professionals that many patients who come into our offices have 
been subjected to violence or abuse," says Terence M. Keane, director of the 
National Center for PTSD at the Boston VA Medical Center. "There's a desperate 
need to help them, but few techniques exist in the literature. EMDR filled a 
terrible vacuum." 
</P>
<P>
 Shapiro, now married to a virtual reality specialist at NASA, travels 25 to 30 
weeks a year giving EMDR-related talks and trainings. But her enthusiastic 
marketing of the therapy has increasingly drawn unfriendly fire both in and 
outside the psychological community: A recent Newsweek article stopped just 
short of dubbing her a latter-day snake oil salesman. At $315 a session, the 
cost of the training is hardly astronomical, but Shapiro has been criticized 
because she has participants sign a statement saying they won't teach EMDR to 
anyone else, in effect giving her proprietary interest in the treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 Shapiro has reported she pays herself no more than $125,000 a year, plowing 
the rest of the profits back into research or financial help for clinicians 
with ill or indigent populations. And she maintains that EMDR is too potent to 
be used by those without experience. "If EMDR went hog wild and was in the 
hands of every lay hypnotist and chiropractor. . . . I felt the responsible 
thing to do was keep it safe, until it is taught in universities." 
</P>
<P>
 Shapiro also has been accused of adopting the role of guru ministering to a 
devoted flock. Such criticisms are largely based on the unquestioning 
acceptance with which some therapists practice EMDR. "It's almost like a mass 
following that has perhaps a cultish nature to it," says Dr. Barbara Rothbaum, 
a PTSD expert and assistant psychiatry professor at Emory Medical School in 
Georgia. "That aspect turns a lot of people off, me included." 
</P>
<P>
 University of Arkansas psychology professor Jeffrey Lohr agrees: "A lot of 
undertrained, scientifically uncritical practitioners are viewing this as a 
kind of magic bullet, one size fits all. They're making extravagant claims 
about the power and pervasiveness of the technique." 
</P>
<P>
 In reporting this story, I did notice the therapy generated peculiar feelings 
of intensity. At one point, I walked into the office of an EMDR practitioner 
and found him waiting for me agitatedly. "I've been talking with some of the 
people you've talked to so far," he told me, "and we're not sure how well you 
understand EMDR" -- leaving me with the uncomfortable sensation that my every 
move was being observed by a network of vigilant therapists. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a gift from God," one of them told me sincerely. "I feel honored to 
be part of this work." 
</P>
<P>
 ELEVEN YEARS AGO, 33-YEAR-OLD ROGER THURSTON WAS WELDING IN the shaft of a 
silver mine on the Utah/Nevada border when the gaseous air below him ignited, 
engulfing him in flames. He lost both arms and his hearing, and after two years 
of hospitalization, needed 24-hour nursing care. During the next six years, he 
was plagued by flashbacks, nightmares and an inability to concentrate. By the 
time he consulted Salt Lake City psychiatrist Dr. David McCann, Thurston was 
desperate. 
</P>
<P>
 McCann asked whether he wanted to try a new PTSD treatment -- one he had never 
used before and only read about. As they went through the EMDR procedure, 
Thurston clearly recalled the clang of his wrench hitting the rocks, shouts 
from his co-workers. He saw the fire around him. As he continued tracking 
McCann's finger, the images gave way to a flooding sensation of peace. Free of 
nightmares or flashbacks, Thurston has weaned himself from nursing care, taught 
himself to drive and joined the board of a nonprofit group helping children who 
need prosthetic limbs. 
</P>
<P>
 Dramatic as such accounts are, and there are many, they count for relatively 
little in the scientific world. Hundreds of patients and clinicians may report 
miraculous changes because of a new therapy, but that doesn't prove that the 
treatment is effective. Patients could be experiencing a placebo effect, 
particularly common with a novel therapy like EMDR. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's something a little flashy about it," says Harvard psychiatrist 
Pitman. "You tell a subject, 'This is a hot new treatment, with a physiological 
component,' and you create a set of expectancies."  
</P>
<P>
 Most scientists, then, make their judgments based on research studies. For 
such a new technique, there's been a surprising amount of research on EMDR. 
Unfortunately, much of it is composed of case studies, the scientific 
equivalent of anecdotal evidence. There are now, however, a number of 
controlled studies of EMDR, done by researchers around the country, in which 
one group of subjects receives the treatment while one or more other groups get 
no therapy and/or a different treatment. These studies, Shapiro asserts, have 
established EMDR's efficacy beyond doubt. "Seven controlled studies of EMDR! 
What more do people want?" she fumes.  
</P>
<P>
 In fact, there are 10, some published and some not. But many researchers 
believe that most of them are preliminary or flawed. The best-designed had the 
least positive results, with a majority finding EMDR either ineffective or no 
more potent than therapy performed without eye movement. The study in which 
Mary Sarner participated has stirred much excitement in the EMDR community 
because results are so encouraging. Details, however, are embargoed until its 
presentation next week at the American Psychological Assn. meeting in Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Right now, it would be easy to conclude that, on balance, EMDR is more sound 
and fury than substance, yet even those whose studies have produced 
less-than-stellar results are reluctant to discount the therapy. Clinical 
psychologist Rick Lytle researched it as a Penn State University graduate 
student under the supervision of anxiety disorders expert Thomas Borkovec. 
Lytle found it essentially no better than two alternative therapies at 
alleviating anxiety symptoms. Even so, he says, "I'm unwilling to throw away 
EMDR, from the point of view of a researcher. I can't account for the 
relatively dramatic results some people claim they're getting, and I think it 
deserves further study." 
</P>
<P>
 And other studies are continuing. Emory University's Rothbaum is looking at 
EMDR as a therapy for rape victims. "I feel like when I present this research, 
I want to wear a big button that says, 'I am not a cult member,' " she says. 
"But it definitely looks to me like there's something there. Even several 
months after treatment, people are saying, 'It changed my life.' " 
</P>
<P>
 SHOULD OUTCOMES BE MORE SALUTARY IN THE NEXT ROUND OF RESEARCH, one more 
question about EMDR will remain. Is this a technique that's telling us 
something new about how the brain functions? Or is it a variation on an already 
familiar theme?  
</P>
<P>
 Several times a night, we enter a sleep stage when our head fills with dreams, 
and our eyes flick quickly back and forth. This, of course, is REM sleep. No 
one knows what the significance of REM is, though scientists increasingly 
suspect that it's a time when the brain sifts through and stores learned 
material. The theory of the EMDR-REM connection thus makes a substantial leap 
in presuming that eye movements in sleep actively trigger a memory processing 
function, and further, that EMDR can activate that function as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet it's not entirely implausible. Jonathan Winson, a neuroscientist at 
Rockefeller University in New York City, has conducted groundbreaking memory 
and sleep research. "I was skeptical, very skeptical," he says about whether 
there might be something to the idea EMDR was related to REM. Nevertheless, he 
attended two trainings. "What I saw there and what I've seen since makes me 
believe there's sufficient effect to warrant further investigation," he says. 
"It's provocative to think there might be a relationship between EMDR and REM 
sleep. But the bottom line is, there's no definitive evidence." 
</P>
<P>
 Shapiro also goes beyond the REM conjecture, offering a larger model of what 
happens when the brain is confronted with a disturbing experience. "When a 
trauma occurs, perceptions that are there at the time of the event are brought 
in, basically locked in the nervous system and held there, unable to process 
through," she says. "We're suggesting that perhaps the eye movement may be a 
body mechanism for catalyzing the inherent information-processing system that 
we all have, in an accelerated manner. The trauma is metabolized, digested, 
whatever, in a couple of 90-minute sessions." 
</P>
<P>
 The issue of how traumatic memories are stored is, if anything, more 
inflammatory than EMDR itself, touching as it does on the question of whether 
shocking memories can be repressed from consciousness. In her professional 
talks, Shapiro is careful to tell audiences the theory is "written on rubber. 
There's not enough known about brain physiology to actually know whether it's 
true or not." Nonetheless, because so much of her language is based on this 
model, listeners might be forgiven for ignoring the caveat. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite her REM hypothesis, Shapiro confusingly also proposes that eye 
movements aren't the only means by which to do EMDR. Therapists, she says, also 
have success using alternate taps on the back of a patient's hands or tones 
sounded alternately in each ear: "Eye movement is the first thing I discovered, 
but it's not the only thing," she says. "Something other than that may be able 
to stimulate the information processing system." 
</P>
<P>
 Or another factor could be at work in successful EMDR cases. Some researchers 
feel EMDR is the latest comer in the group of behavior therapies known as 
exposure therapies, which traditionally have been used to treat anxiety 
disorders, including phobias and PTSD. Exposure therapy has patients confront, 
in a safe setting, the thing causing them pain or fear. A patient is asked to 
imagine a traumatic situation -- a disturbing memory of combat, say -- and stay 
with the feelings that arise until the anxiety diminishes. 
</P>
<P>
 "It can be traumatic," says Dr. Patrick Boudewyns, chief of pyschology at the 
VA Medical Center in Augusta, Ga. "Patients don't want to do it; they get very 
emotional."  
</P>
<P>
 EMDR also starts by asking patients to conjure a painful recollection. But the 
eye movements might serve as a diversion of sorts, allowing patients to keep 
anxiety at a manageable level. "It's something like desensitization, with a 
cute little device to distract a person from shifting his attention away," 
suggests Penn State's Borkovec. "It's as if I was afraid of snakes, and you're 
trying to get me to approach one. As I do that, you're shooting off beautiful 
fireworks around me. So I keep my eyes open, and maybe some of the exposure to 
the snake is getting in." 
</P>
<P>
 Adds Boudewyns: "I think EMDR is a better way to do what we've already been 
doing, and if that's all it is -- that's enough, that's good." But studies have 
yet to prove that the movements add something to the overall procedure. Seven 
of the 10 controlled studies included a so-called component analysis: one group 
of subjects had EMDR, while another group went through the procedure, keeping 
their eyes fixed at the point where they'd normally move them. In four studies, 
those who got EMDR improved no more than those in the eyes-fixed group. 
</P>
<P>
 That, points out Lohr of the University of Arkansas, could be because most 
studies have been small, lacking statistical power. "The mean is a fiction," he 
says. "Some people in the studies change not at all, others a great deal. I've 
seen this treatment work wonders for some people. We need to go back and 
identify those who did change and say, 'What distinguishes them?' " 
</P>
<P>
 SPEND ENOUGH TIME HEARING about a new therapy with miraculous curative powers 
and you'll inevitably grow curious. Twice, I tried EMDR. I had no horrendous 
traumas to work on, but since therapists at the trainings go through it, it 
seemed reasonable to expect I could get something out of it, too. In New York, 
I focused on the memory of an old school failure that I've thought might still 
have ramifications in my life, and in California, on something upsetting that 
had just happened in a personal relationship.  
</P>
<P>
 I'd been warned by EMDR folks to approach the therapy carefully, lest 
repressed material suddenly burst forth and traumatize me. Instead, the process 
remained a fairly intellectual one. No lurking memories or vivid images 
surfaced. I had no cathartic gush. 
</P>
<P>
 True, the conditions under which I tried EMDR would never pass muster in a 
clinical trial. I felt decidedly awkward at dropping my journalistic guard with 
people I'd just interviewed. In each case, I tried only a session of treatment, 
barely time enough for me to get the hang of EMDR. 
</P>
<P>
 I wouldn't dismiss EMDR on the basis of my own experiences, but I can testify 
it's not something that works automatically. Indeed, most therapists I spoke 
with, Shapiro included, assured me that they don't regard EMDR as a panacea. 
But there seem to be few ills that proponents aren't prepared to address. EMDR 
is currently being applied in child psychology, to multiple personality 
disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorders and even to stimulating "peak 
performance." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's being promoted as a breakthrough for virtually every form of 
psychopathology out there, when there are already established therapies to 
treat a lot of those conditions," asserts Dr. Kim Mueser, associate psychiatry 
professor at Dartmouth Medical School. "Those should be the first choice, 
treatments with a track record."  
</P>
<P>
 Yet many untested therapies are being used on patients today. For instance, 
Wolpe points out, "Psychoanalysis has been the thing for 70 years, but no one 
cares about the lack of demonstrated efficacy of that. People just go on doing 
it, even though it has not been shown to have any notable efficacy." 
</P>
<P>
 Many therapists working in the area of post-traumatic stress believe Shapiro's 
efforts will ultimately give the field a needed prod. "Francine gets criticized 
for taking this to the clinical level before the research is done, but I don't 
think it's all that bad," says Boudewyns. "It gets people to thinking about it 
and kind of pushes the scientists along. God knows, we need better treatment 
for trauma and anxiety-related problems. This is a non-drug, it has virtually 
no side-effects. How much better could you get?" 
</P>
<P>
 Ideally, EMDR would be further tested in studies comparing it to the best 
therapies available for the specific condition being treated. Until then, there 
is only the testimony of those who've benefited from EMDR. 
</P>
<P>
 Months after she went through her first session, Mary Sarner has had 
additional cancer surgery that left her unable to speak. But she and her 
husband have drawn closer and are going through the ordeal together. Sarner 
continues to use the therapy and is urging other cancer patients she knows to 
try it, too. Without EMDR, Sarner says unequivocally, she would never have 
tried to keep going. With it, she knows she still has something to live for.

JUKE JOINTS, ROADHOUSES AND SOUTHERN PARABLES; THE DOCUMENTARY LYRICISM OF 
PHOTOGRAPHER BIRNEY IMES

<BYLINE>

By Grover Lewis, Grover Lewis is an expatriated Southerner who lives in Santa 
Monica. His work has appeared in Rolling Stone, the Village Voice and Texas 
Monthly. He is now working on a memoir of his Texas family to be titled Goodbye 
If You Call That Gone.

 COLUMBUS, A COUNTY SEAT OF 23,800 IN NORTHEAST Mississippi, is as pretty as an 
antique ball gown. In its well-preserved but not over-dandified historic 
district, more than a 100 stately pleasure domes survive from the antebellum 
era, and goo-goo clusters of architecture and history buffs regularly trek 
through the broad, shady avenues to marvel at restored showplaces with nobby 
names like Shadowlawn, White Arches and Rosewood Manor. It's a slow, 
rocking-chair kind of place where everyone seemingly knows everyone else and 
the residents are likely to wave to you from their lawns and trellised 
verandas. Still, the overall feel of the place is modern, if not quite 
postmodern. A franchise-choked commercial strip spreads like a weed patch along 
the east-west highway, and downtown -- where a little known but gifted 
photographer named Birney Imes keeps a studio above the old Princess Theater -- 
is still intact and vital. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990, Imes positioned himself among the cream of Southern documentary 
lyricists with the publication of "Juke Joint." The book comprises a series of 
paradoxically lush-colored, yet stark images taken in the lowdown black 
honky-tonks and rural dance halls of the Mississippi Delta, some 200 miles from 
Columbus -- places with names like "The Out of Sight Club" and "The Uptight 
Cafe." For weeks, I pored over Imes' dreamy, almost unpeopled photos, admiring 
his delicacy in capturing the decor and ambience of an insular black subculture 
-- Imes himself is white -- and savoring the juicy strangeness of the Delta 
milieu. 
</P>
<P>
 The photographer's strongest images, endearingly funky and executed in classic 
documentary style, recalled James Agee's dictum about the camera being the 
central instrument of the age. "(The) camera can do what nothing else in the 
world can do," Agee wrote, ". . . perceive, record, and communicate, in full 
unaltered power, the peculiar kinds of poetic vitality which blaze in every 
real thing and which are in great degree . . . lost to every other kind of 
art." 
</P>
<P>
 When I called Imes to make hasty arrangements to visit his hometown, he was 
agreeable to getting together, although he said he was "right busy" making 
prints for his first Southern California exhibition (at the Gallery of 
Contemporary Photography in Santa Monica through Aug. 28). He went on to say 
that he had various pressing domestic obligations, such as coaching a Little 
League ballgame, preparatory to leaving with his family the following week for 
a long-planned vacation in England. "Have you ever been to Mississippi?" Imes 
asked politely. I told him I'd once set out on a quixotic quest to meet William 
Faulkner. I got as close as Faulkner's front gate, came to my senses and went 
home to Texas. "The same thing happened to me with Walker Percy," Imes said, 
laughing. "Come on down. We'll drive around and see some of the countryside." 
</P>
<P>
 I took lodgings at the Amzi Love Bed & Breakfast, a hospitable haven built in 
1848, and I was just unpacking when Imes dropped by from his house in the next 
block with a set of galleys for his new book, "Whispering Pines," named after a 
gritty country roadhouse that gradually desegregated itself during the '70s and 
'80s. Imes, who is 43, has clear hazel eyes and a halting, shy, Jimmy 
Stewart-sort of delivery. Even exchanging our brief how-do-you-do's, he struck 
me as a man who ponders things, turns them over in his mind. 
</P>
<P>
 There are several stories related in "Whispering Pines" -- hard and 
compassionate, devilish and rhapsodic -- but the principal one belongs to Blume 
Triplett, a backwoods product of Mississippi's segregationist past. Until about 
a generation ago, strident and often violent resistance to the mixing of the 
races kept the state and, indeed, the entirety of the Old Confederacy, on the 
wrong foot in the national parade. Kick-started by the civil rights movement 
and grounded in the traditional interconnectedness of blacks and whites, an 
organic change began to take hold. "Whispering Pines" conjures a place and a 
time and a process -- the palpable world of a highway beer joint -- through an 
internal narrative and a cast of characters worthy of a great Southern novel. 
</P>
<P>
 "It must have been 1975 or 1976 when I first set foot in the Pines," Imes 
relates in a lucid accompanying essay. "I had just begun photographing 
seriously and would spend hours driving back roads looking for a . . . 
situation to photograph. It didn't take long to stumble upon the place . . . 
the rusting cars, the hedge in the parking lot dividing the White Side and the 
Black Side, and the stuff . . . inside and out: coin scales, pinball machines, 
jukeboxes, lawn mowers, old campaign posters, newspapers, guns, cigar boxes and 
beer signs . . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "At the center of it all was Blume Clayton Triplett, born in . . . 1902. Blume 
had moved . . . nearby . . . in the early twenties to open a mechanic shop . . 
. . (In) 1921, Blume married Eppie Cunningham, and it was for Miss Eppie that 
he built the Pines almost thirty years later . . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "By the time I walked into the Pines, Eppie had been dead a couple of years 
and the place was a shell of its former self. Food was no longer served; Blume 
held court on the White Side with an occasional (customer) stopping by to 
visit, drink a beer and reminisce . . . . Rosie Stevenson . . . operated the 
Black Side. 
</P>
<P>
 "My visits were usually long; we would spend hours telling stories, sharing 
meals, listening to the jukebox and making pictures. There was a sense of 
family among Blume, Rosie and the rest of the neighborhood, all sharing a 
common history. And there was always something going on -- a dog to bury, a 
birthday to celebrate, a chitlins supper for the regulars . . . . I loved the 
place, and I loved the people passing through it . . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "Blume's health began to decline, and he moved over to the Black Side so Rosie 
could better take care of him. The White Side, clogged with debris he had 
collected over the years, became known as the 'archives.' Though Blume's last 
years were spent without sight, he enjoyed receiving a steady stream of 
visitors, smoking cheap cigars, listening to blues music . . . until a ruptured 
appendix put him in the hospital in 1989. He never returned to the Pines . . . 
. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rosie, who will inherit the property, says she has no plans to reopen . . . . 
Even now when I go in and walk through those rooms I enter some sort of 
reverie. It's as though I'm the curator and sole patron of a forgotten museum . 
. . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Imes photographs the faded domain of the Pines -- the grizzled Triplett, the 
sweet-faced Rosie and a large supporting cast of poor black and good ol' boy 
patrons -- with a sense of transfixed wonder. It's a signature trait carried 
over from "Juke Joint's" vision of Southern-slash-American culture as a 
constant interplay of "found" and refound materials, an inextricable blend 
rather than separate, autonomous cultures. 
</P>
<P>
 But "Whispering Pines" is looser and larger than "Juke Joint" -- and vastly 
deeper. Cultural snobs will have a hard time with the book because it 
celebrates a larger-than-life, cruder-than-dirt, stereotypical "cracker" -- a 
feral old duff not even near the fringes of respectable society. Imes sees and 
captures in Triplett an odd human instrument whose slow and painful demise 
suggests the close of one chapter of our national history and the opening of 
another. The gentlest of Imes' images memorialize Triplett in post-mortem 
cigar-box assemblages of the old pack rat's prized trinkets and relics. The 
rest of the photos are raw and indelible, suffused with the gorgeous and 
appalling spectacle of the real. When I closed the book near midnight of my 
first day's stay, I realized exactly what had drawn me to Columbus. Over a 
period of 15 years, keeping tabs on a country barkeep's allegiances and life 
changes, Birney Imes had photographed a parable of the New South. 
</P>
<P>
 DRESSED IN KHAKI SLACKS AND A BLUE cotton shirt, with an athletic spring in 
his step, Imes looks like a boyish but very sharp young professor. He called 
for me early the next day and we had coffee with his wife, Beth, who is also an 
artist as well as the longtime director of Columbus' arts-in-the-schools 
program. The couple's children -- Peter, 15, John, 13, and a daughter, Tanner, 
11 -- trooped through the large kitchen on their way to year-end classes, all 
of them resembling one or the other of their striking parents. 
</P>
<P>
 Imes showed me a well-thumbed copy of "Passionate Visions of the American 
South: Self-Taught Artists From 1940 to the Present," chortling fondly over the 
"outsider" contributors' blunt-spoken statements of purpose. Fat cardinals 
pecked at a feeder outside the window, and a distant carillon pealed out "Let 
the Lower Lights Be Burning." The Imes house, a modernized 1 1/2-story 
Victorian, seemed modest and lived-in compared to the columned shrines nearby. 
But it was far removed in psychic miles from Blume Triplett's dilapidated 
fiefdom. 
</P>
<P>
 In his beat-up Honda, Imes drove me through the historic quarter, pointing out 
landmarks -- the Friendship Cemetery, with its ranks of Union and Confederate 
markers from the Battle of Shiloh, and the former rectory of St. Paul's 
Episcopal Church that served as Tennessee Williams' first home. Imes is 
uncommonly well-read, and we began a continuing discussion of the Southern 
writers we admired, ranging from Faulkner to Breece D'J Pancake and Richard 
Ford (who wrote the introduction to "Juke Joint"). 
</P>
<P>
 Cruising back toward downtown, Imes spotted a friend named Jackie Ball and 
pulled over to the curb. Ball, a stocky black man with a sweat shirt knotted 
around his neck, approached the car and leaned down at the window. "Hey, 
Birney!" "How y' doing, Jackie? Meet my friend here." Ball pressed my hand with 
a hard, measuring grip, and the two of them exchanged a minute's small talk. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jackie is on the City Council now. He gives everybody hell, I guess," Imes 
said, driving on. "He's a really great guy and a good friend of mine." He 
glanced across at me to see if I was alert to his meaning. "Jackie sort of 
changed my life, in fact. We met back in the late '60s when the schools were 
first being integrated. We played sports together, ran track and all. He showed 
me a whole world I'd never known about before, and that kind of blew things 
open for me." 
</P>
<P>
 Imes parked under the Princess Theater marquee. "Columbus was smaller then, if 
you can imagine it, and there was almost no crossover between blacks and 
whites. It's a better, healthier place now. Listen, are you hungry yet? There's 
a pretty good soul-food place a couple of doors down." Our check for dressing 
and gravy, butter beans and iced tea came to a total of $5.50. And everybody in 
the small cafe eventually drifted by to say hello to Imes, pat him amiably on 
the shoulder and wish him good luck on his trip "overseas." 
</P>
<P>
 Imes graduated from the University of Tennessee (Class of '73) with a history 
degree but no clear sense of direction. He traveled around the country for a 
while, sampling the territory and the possibilities from Massachusetts to 
Southern California. Then he returned to Columbus and took a job at the family 
newspaper, where he taught himself the nuts and bolts of photography. Imes' 
father, like his father before him, is the owner and publisher of Columbus' 
daily Commercial Dispatch. 
</P>
<P>
 At the paper, Imes handled the assignments of a journeyman staffer -- shooting 
high-school football games and wrecks on the highway -- but he also began to 
develop full-page photo essays twice a week. The work plunged him into 
exploring the unmapped purlieus of "the Prairie," a nearby rural area whose 
inhabitants -- people like Blume Triplett and Rosie Stevenson -- still lived in 
ways largely untouched by contemporary history. Imes photographed coon hunts, 
river baptisms and hog killings in the Prairie's scattered black and white 
communities, ingratiating himself with the locals by "visiting" before breaking 
out his camera. His standard approach was to make friends, then to make 
pictures, and he usually returned later with prints of his work to cement the 
relationship. 
</P>
<P>
 Imes left the paper after a year and a half, but committed to photography by 
now, he opened a shop of his own, shooting family portraits and the like to pay 
the rent and support his frequent returns to the back country. His commercial 
work eventually grew to include advertising accounts and editorial assignments 
for such publications as the Washington Post Magazine and Texas Monthly. He 
also served as the set photographer on "Mississippi Masala." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, his "own work" as a self-taught artist also flourished. At the 
20-year mark in his career, Imes' photographs have been included in shows at 
the Museum of Modern Art, the Whitney Museum's Phillip Morris branch and the 
University of Arizona's Center for Creative Photography. In a 1991 group show 
at the Tartt Gallery in Washington, Imes' Delta images were displayed along 
with the works of William Christenberry, Keith Carter, William Eggleston, 
Debbie Fleming Caffery and Clarence John Laughlin -- a generation of 
distinguished Southern photographers. 
</P>
<P>
 We had been talking in Imes' handsome, Spartan studio above the old movie 
house for almost an hour, with the photographer relating his vita in candid and 
often whimsical anecdotes. But when I asked about his relation to those leading 
Southern lights featured in the Tartt show, he paused and let out a little 
sigh, seeming flustered. With some prodding -- "Who helped you learn things?" 
-- he said finally: "Well, I mean, I can throw out names of people whose work I 
was drawn to -- Robert Frank . . . Josef Koudelka. And I think everyone who 
photographs in color owes something to William Eggleston. And to many others, 
you know." Well, I thought I knew. In a coded, guarded way, Imes seemed to be 
saying that his ambitions surpassed the regional. He meant to be world-class. 
</P>
<P>
 Restive, Imes rose from his chair and I switched off the tape recorder. He 
crossed the room to the tall windows overlooking the street and stood peering 
out for a minute. Then he turned back to me, smiling and motioning toward the 
door. "Let's go for a ride," he suggested. 
</P>
<P>
 IMES DROVE WEST across the Tombigbee River and turned south on U.S. 45 into 
the Prairie. The highway, almost empty of traffic, wound through low, rolling 
hills and lush farmland cultivated in patches of cotton and immense tracts of 
soybeans. Hedgerows of green ash and red oak lined the fields, and dirt lanes 
snaked off toward hidden farmhouses. The day was warm, edging toward steamy, 
and we rode through stretches of sun and shadow with the windows rolled down 
and a hint of rain in the rushing air. We talked casually at first, then fell 
silent. The land and the towering thickets of trees gave off a dense, primeval 
hum that enfolded you after a while. 
</P>
<P>
 Fifteen miles from town, Imes pulled off into a tangle of undergrowth that I 
didn't immediately recognize as a parking lot and rolled to a stop at the end 
of a cinder-block building resembling a stock shed. The old WHISPERING PINES 
sign lettered along the roof line had faded almost to invisibility. Across the 
lot, two black men in work clothes emerged from a screen door and wrestled an 
ancient dresser into a pickup truck. Imes greeted them pleasantly and called 
out, "Where's Rosie?" "She's inside, sir." 
</P>
<P>
 "Welcome to the 'archives,' " Imes said and led the way into the gloomy 
partitioned rooms, cautioning me to watch my step. Almost at once I slipped on 
a mangled 45-r.p.m. record, part of the litter scattered all over the pocky 
slab floor. Ragged and nearly impassable aisles ran through boxes, crates, 
cartons, piles, stacks, heaps and bunches of miscellaneous goods and trash. 
Years of grime and dust covered everything. Rosie Stevenson stepped forward to 
greet Imes and to shake my hand with a friendly, appraising look. "Ain't it a 
mess?" she asked, rolling her eyes. "I'm gonna need me a lot of hands to ever 
get it all cleaned up." 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, a whole bunch of it's gone already," Imes said. "You giving some more 
stuff away?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes. Those men out yonder are workin' at my house. I let 'em have those old 
dressers in the back and some other little things they might use." 
</P>
<P>
 "Triplett never threw anything away?" I asked. "Anything at all?" 
</P>
<P>
 "No," Rosie said, "he never much did." 
</P>
<P>
 Imes laughed and pointed to a tottering cairn of cigar boxes, scores of them 
stacked halfway to the ceiling. "Beth came out once and asked him for five or 
six of those for a Sunday School project, and it was like she was asking for 
pearls or something. He finally let her have 'em, but under pressure." 
</P>
<P>
 "Set in his ways." 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, he was," Rosie said. "But I worked for him, and he was everything to me. 
You could say he was just like a father, a brother, a husband or what-have-you. 
We had some real good times out here, him and me and all of us." 
</P>
<P>
 "There were booths when I first started coming by," Imes said, walking around. 
"Peoples' names were carved in them. There was a door that said 'Yellow Canary 
Dining Room,' and the one over there said 'Colored Dining Room.' " 
</P>
<P>
 "How did the dividing line start to break down?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, it was more fun on the Black Side," Imes said. "Right?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah," Rosie nodded with a smile, "it was more fun. I worked both sides, and 
peoples over here would say, 'Rosie, why can't I go over there? Seems like 
y'all's music is better over there than ours.' I said, 'Well, it's all right 
with me. If Mr. Blume don't care, go on.' Sometimes he would say they could, 
and sometimes he'd tell 'em no. Then it got to where he didn't care. He sat on 
(the Black Side) all the time anyway, and then everybody else would come on 
that side. It was just a natural thing." 
</P>
<P>
 "Step back through here," Imes beckoned. He led the way along a dogleg hall 
and opened the door on a dingy, cluttered little cubicle with one small window. 
"This is where Blume lived in his last 10 years. The bed's gone, but otherwise 
it's pretty much the way he left it. After his eyesight went, Rosie would put 
him to bed at night and he'd stay here until she came back the next morning. 
She cooked for him, did everything for him. And really, she was his closest kin 
and her family was part of his extended family." 
</P>
<P>
 Toeing around in the mulch on the floor, I spotted a spent .38 shell. Imes 
picked up a folded $10 bill and stood pensively turning it over in his hands. 
Just then -- " 'Scuse us, please" -- the workmen entered and began to move a 
three-legged dresser out of a closet. "Oh, this is hard to watch," Imes said 
softly, retreating to the Black Side, where he walked around in little circles 
with his hands in his pockets. 
</P>
<P>
 Mopping my brow against the muggy heat, I asked Rosie to tell me more about 
Triplett. 
</P>
<P>
 "You talkin' 'bout how he was with other people?" She reflected. "Well, there 
were times when I thought that he were mean. Then, in his older days, he were 
very good. He was kind-hearted." She bent to pick up a packet of crumpled 
Christmas cards, smoothing them. "But you know, when all is said and done, I 
believe he's with the Lord. I think, you know, he made some good choices and he 
made some bad choices. But put the good and the bad together, and I just say he 
was all right. He was all right." 
</P>
<P>
 Smiling, Imes came over and handed Rosie the $10 bill. "This was on the 
bedroom floor." 
</P>
<P>
 "It was?" She tucked the money into her handbag and slipped the strap over her 
arm. "Well, I'm goin' home -- it's gettin' hot. I'll let you lock up. Got your 
key? OK." At the door, she turned to wave -- and pointed a mock-stern finger at 
me. "Now you be good , hear? And I hope you'll be enjoyin' your stay down 
here." 
</P>
<P>
 Together and singly, Imes and I roamed around the Black Side, rummaging 
through Triplett's jumbled collections. The agglomeration was stupefying: 
political leaflets, Bible tracts, soda pop signs, toys, stoves, defunct TVs, 
tools, newspapers and correspondence dating back 50 years. It was a redneck 
Xanadu, a catalogue raisonne of American junk. 
</P>
<P>
 After a while, Imes wandered back into Triplett's bedroom, and I followed. 
This time I picked up the .38 casing as a souvenir. 
</P>
<P>
 "Was there often violence out here? Fistfights and so on?" 
</P>
<P>
 "No. Blume was pretty much a no-foolishness kind of guy. He always carried a 
gun, (but) he'd just run people off if they were troublemakers." Imes went on 
to say that Triplett was neither a drinker nor a hard-core racist and basically 
aimed to get along with everybody. "He dearly loved celebrations and went to 
all lengths to stir one up. He'd write on dollar bills, little sayings, and 
give them to people for birthday presents. 'Keep Me and You'll Never Be Broke' 
-- things like that." 
</P>
<P>
 Imes peered warily into the empty closet, then turned away. He mentioned again 
that it was distressing to see the Pines being dismantled. "Blume made me the 
executor for his will, and I had the place pretty much to myself for a couple 
of years. I drove out, oh, once or twice a month to nose around, see what I 
could find. The things I was really interested in were his relics and letters. 
Gradually, I picked out things I knew that he prized, photographing some of the 
cigar-box assemblages here and some back at the studio. 
</P>
<P>
 "But when I first started coming to the Pines in the mid-'70s, I had no idea a 
book would ever develop out of it. I was just one of the regulars. There were 
always people coming through, and all kinds of stories and different things 
happening. Blume just sort of sat and absorbed it all -- relished it all -- and 
I don't think there was anything stereotypical at all in his relationship to 
the black community. He felt in a family way toward much of the clientele. I 
think they all understood and loved each other in their own way, despite their 
faults or the (happenings of the) past. The transformation of racial attitudes 
was a very powerful thing to witness." 
</P>
<P>
 Late in the afternoon, the sky darkened and thunder rumbled across the 
Prairie. "It's about to rain," Imes said, locking up, and we dashed for the car 
as the first drops fell. He drove a maze of country roads back toward town as 
the storm burst in blinding sheets. 
</P>
<P>
 Imes had recorded Triplett's 84th birthday party, and he put the tape in the 
deck with a little smile. Over the thrumming rain, Triplett's voice crackled 
with the force of nature: 
</P>
<P>
 " This is Blume talkin', and I just want to say a few words to all of y'all. I 
had a mighty good time today. My friend Birney Imes come down about 11 o'clock. 
He come by to get some barbecue, and then he got a peach pie and some chitlins. 
We been eatin' chitlins. (SOUND OF A ROOSTER CROWING.) You hear my rooster 
cryin', don't you? He run in the door, he done come in. Birney's been takin' 
some pictures, a good friend of mine, and he took a picture of my rooster. He 
took a picture of all of us! And (we) went out from the kitchen and I got a 
30-gallon cask drum out there, and I got a goose settin' in it. And he took a 
picture of the goose. I got four Chinese white geese, one hen and three jacks. 
Birney took a picture of all of us!"

COOLING TREND IS EXPECTED TO BREAK THE SCORCHING HEAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEN HALL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Frequent dips into the frothy ocean near the Huntington Beach Pier and iced 
coffees helped Sarah and Maureen Noone keep cool Saturday on what 
meteorologists called one of the hottest days of the summer, even along the 
beach. 
</P>
<P>
 A high of 96 degrees was recorded in Lake Forest. The all-time record for the 
date is 99, set in Anaheim on Aug. 6, 1951, according to Orange County 
historian Jim Sleeper.  
</P>
<P>
 Thousands flocked to the county beaches where the temperatures were cooler -- 
in the upper 70s and low 80s -- but the baking sand, lack of breeze and 
relentless sunshine kept the Noone sisters in and out of the surf. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only way to get through this heat is to keep jumping in the water," said 
21-year-old Maureen Noone, a resident of Huntington Beach, who stayed in her 
bikini top and shorts as she walked briskly down Olive Street with her sister. 
"You just really have to go for it and jump into the waves. It feels great." 
</P>
<P>
 The San Clemente Pier recorded the hottest beach temperature -- 84 degrees -- 
and the lack of wind kept the heat wave going through the late afternoon, said 
Steve Lashbrook, a marine safety officer. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was hot today, really hot. What wind there was died and that kept the 
temperature up," Lashbrook said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other highs included 94 in Anaheim, 94 in Santa Ana, 92 in Irvine, and 86 in 
Laguna Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 A cooling trend is expected to begin today and continue through the early part 
of the week, said Curtis Brack, a meteorologist for WeatherData, which provides 
forecasts for The Times. Highs today should drop slightly to the lower 90s 
inland, and lower 70s at the beach, and then drop again into the 80s inland 
Monday, Brack said. 
</P>
<P>
 The cooling is expected to come from a storm system that has been idling off 
the Oregon coast, Brack said. As it moves south it should rebuild the marine 
layer that tends to cool the temperatures, Brack said. 
</P>
<P>
 The storm brings a low pressure front that allows the clouds and fog to build, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was hardly any marine layer today; what there was was very shallow," 
Brack said Saturday. "You had a little bit of offshore breeze in the morning. 
When those winds come downhill off the mountains and into the valleys, they 
really warm up." 
</P>
<P>
 The slight offshore breeze was good news to surfers, as was the consistent 
four- and in some places five-foot south and southwesterly swell that hit most 
of the county beaches, particularly Huntington Beach, where the U.S. Open of 
Surfing ends today. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had good surf for the contest all week and it was a solid two to four 
feet today," said senior lifeguard Todd Bartlett. He called the 75 degrees 
recorded in Surf City on Saturday "very hot" on the sand for the estimated 
70,000 people who visited the beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "Considering the fact that we've had some gloomy weather this year, this is 
the hottest it's been for awhile," Bartlett said. 
</P>
<P>
 The surf was a little bigger -- three to five feet -- at most of Newport Beach 
with the best waves breaking outside of the jetties at the mouth of the Santa 
Ana River, said lifeguard Chris Graham. An estimated 85,000 people enjoyed the 
sun and kept the lifeguards busy, Graham said. 
</P>
<P>
 Newport Beach lifeguards made 75 rescues throughout the day Saturday, but 
there were no serious injuries, Graham said. 
</P>
<P>
 The humidity Saturday ranged from 30% to 40% throughout most of the afternoon, 
but rose to 60% by 9:30 p.m., according to a reading taken at the Tustin Marine 
Corps Air Station.

DANA PARSONS: THE BOY ASKED HIS FATHER: 'WHAT'S CATCH? WAS IT FUN?'

<P>
 A father and son are in the back yard of their home, playing badminton. The 
boy, 7, runs deep into the corner, almost into the bushes, but makes a 
successful backhand swat of the birdie over the net. "Good return, son!" his 
father says. "You're getting better every day."  
</P>
<P>
 The son beams. "I want to play for the Hummingbirds when I grow up. Most of 
the guys at school want to play pro horseshoes, but I told 'em I'm going to 
play badminton."  
</P>
<P>
 "You keep this up, and you might make it," his father replies.  
</P>
<P>
 "Dad, when you were a kid, did you and Grandpa play badminton?"  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 His father grew silent and looked away. Several seconds passed before he 
spoke. 
</P>
<P>
 "No, son, we used to play catch." 
</P>
<P>
 "What's catch?" his son asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well," his father said, "catch was part of a game called baseball. You'd 
stand maybe 20 or 30 feet apart and toss a ball back and forth and catch it in 
a leather glove so you wouldn't hurt your hand."  
</P>
<P>
 "Was it fun?" 
</P>
<P>
 The father brought his son over to the porch and they sat down together. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was the greatest, son. When I'd play catch with your grandpa, even if we 
didn't talk we were connected because we each had an unspoken responsibility to 
the other to throw and catch. Just the two of us, nobody else around, and you 
both had to depend on the other. Just having your dad play catch with you meant 
he trusted you. At least that's how I looked at it. I'm not sure I can explain 
it to you, but just catching a ball thrown to you by your father was an 
experience that's hard to put into words. Every time I'd catch and throw the 
ball back, I knew I had done good, even if he didn't say anything." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's kinda hard to talk during badminton, isn't it, Dad?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah," the father said, smiling. "It's not quite the same." 
</P>
<P>
 "You said there was a game called baseball? What happened to it?" 
</P>
<P>
 "That's a long story. I hate to even think about it. It was the greatest game 
ever invented. It was one of the greatest things ever invented. They played it 
for more than 100 years and then one summer the players quit playing because 
they wanted more money. And they never started up again because the people who 
hired them wouldn't give it to them. It made the public mad, because the 
players were making a million dollars to play."  
</P>
<P>
 "Players made a million dollars?" the boy asked. "And they quit playing? They 
must have really been greedy. My friend says the Hummingbirds' best player only 
gets $50 a game." 
</P>
<P>
 "They were greedy back then, but it was more complicated than that. It's not 
like today, where sports aren't that important. Players then made more money 
than they could ever spend in their lifetimes, but they convinced themselves 
there was a principle involved." 
</P>
<P>
 "Aren't principles about right and wrong?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Right. Believe me, son, principle had nothing to do with killing baseball. 
But the other part I didn't tell you is that the people who hired the players 
were greedy, too. They started paying players a lot of money, because they 
wanted to win more games, and pretty soon things got out of control. I've 
talked to you before about how too much money can make people do bad things." 
</P>
<P>
 The father could tell his son was perplexed.  
</P>
<P>
 "It was confusing to people at the time, too, son. The players blamed the 
owners for ruining baseball, and the owners blamed the players. Pretty soon, 
the public just got sick of the whole thing. It didn't really matter who was 
right or wrong, because with so much money involved, ordinary people didn't 
like either side. They loved baseball for entertainment and relaxation. The 
players and owners took that away from them, and the public didn't forgive them 
because they realized that neither side cared about them. After a year or so, 
everybody just quit talking about baseball and it died." 
</P>
<P>
 "Where did the owners get all their money to pay the players?" 
</P>
<P>
 "TV networks paid them, and millions of people would go watch games in person. 
It's hard to explain to you, son, how much people loved baseball. It's not like 
the Hummingbirds. People loved sports back in those days, and they talked about 
baseball year-round. That's why everybody was so mad when they quit playing." 
</P>
<P>
 "Do you miss baseball, Dad?" 
</P>
<P>
 "I used to. But not anymore. I just don't think about it anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 The boy sat quietly, sensing that he had made his father unhappy. 
</P>
<P>
 "We better get back to playing, son. It's getting dark." 
</P>
<P>
 "OK, Dad," the boy said, resuming his position across the net. He whacked the 
birdie to his father. 
</P>
<P>
 The sound of the birdie on the racket made a weak "pfft" sound. The boy's 
father closed his eyes and tried to remember a sweeter sound -- no, the 
sweetest sound -- the sound of the crack of a bat on a baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 But try as he might, he could summon only a distant echo from the recesses of 
his memory, from a time long ago when people used to play a game called 
baseball.

 Laguna Walks--Sierra Sage, a relatively new sub-chapter of the Sierra Club, 
holds twice-weekly conditioning hikes in Laguna Beach, sometimes on the streets 
and sometimes on fire roads in the nearby hills. Sunday walks at 8 a.m. are 
held year-round; Wednesday walks at 6:30 p.m. will be held until daylight 
saving time ends in fall. 
</P>
<P>
 The main purpose of the walks is to maintain cardiovascular conditioning for 
other club events held throughout the year, such as a six-mile hike up 
Mt.Stoddard (near Mt. Baldy) planned for Aug. 13. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are lots of hills in Laguna Beach," said David Perlman, vice chairman 
of the club. "We always try to get at least 600 feet of elevation gain." Groups 
for the twice-weekly walks usually are less than 10, and serve as a good 
introduction to the club, Perlman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The walk routes vary, but meet always at the parking structure at the 
intersection of Glenneyre and Park streets in Laguna Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Other club events range from an Aug. 14 champagne brunch and hike to a 
five-day boat trip through the Channel Islands in September. Information: (714) 
494-3268. 
</P>
<P>
 Bugged?--Parents too squeamish to teach their kids about the insect world can 
leave that job to the Children's Museum of La Habra. "What's Bugging You?" is a 
hands-on display on view through Sept. 11, and dedicated to creepy, crawly 
things. 
</P>
<P>
 Another permanent exhibit at the museum focuses on paleontology and allows 
youngsters to search for dinosaur bones in a simulated dig. The museum, at 301 
S. Euclid St. in La Habra, is open from 1 to 5 p.m. Sunday and 10 a.m. to 5 
p.m. Monday through Saturday. Admission is $4, with children under 2 free.

IT IS THE MOST-QUOTED STOCK INDEX, BUT IS IT THE BEST MARKET BAROMETER? LET'S 
DEMYSTIFY . . . ; THE DOW JONES INDUSTRIAL AVERAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHY M. KRISTOF, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the realm of finance, there's no term quite as widely used or as constantly 
quoted as the Dow . 
</P>
<P>
 To many, the Dow Jones industrial average -- an index of just 30 stocks -- is 
the market. The stock market -- composed of more than 6,700 issues -- is the 
Dow. And the Dow has almost mystical qualities as an indicator of health and a 
forecaster of economic and political news. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, in an economy where the majority of the nation's workers provide services 
rather than assemble manufactured goods, some find our fascination with an 
industrial average puzzling. At the same time, many professionals question the 
Dow's effectiveness as an indicator of the market as a whole. 
</P>
<P>
 Unquestionably, the Dow -- which closed at 3,747.02 on Friday -- has 
paralleled the nation's good times and bad. From nearly 400 in 1929, it crashed 
to 45 in 1932 with the Depression, climbed back to 400 again by 1955 with the 
postwar boom, reached 1,000 for the first time in 1972, 2,000 in 1987 and 3,000 
in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Dow, some brokers and analysts say, is too narrow and too susceptible 
to violent short-term swings. And the companies in it, they say, are no longer 
representative of the U.S. economy. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Dow Jones industrial average has become such an ingrained part of Wall 
Street's culture that it's hard to imagine getting through a day without 
mentioning it," says Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer at First Albany 
Corp. in New York. "But as popular and fashionable as the Dow is, it's just not 
used in serious research. It does not adequately represent what's happening in 
the market." 
</P>
<P>
 John Prestbo, markets editor at the Wall Street Journal, a Dow Jones & Co. 
subsidiary, and one of three editors who recommend changes in the index, is 
familiar with the criticisms but says there are no plans to change the index. 
Change would ruin one of the Dow's finest qualities: the 66-year history that 
has made it the best-known and most widely quoted stock index in America. The 
Dow also doesn't purport to be an economic flag, or even an indicator of 
overall market health, Prestbo says. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Dow is what it is. It does not purport to measure the entire stock 
market. It purports to measure 30 blue chip stocks," he says. "What these 
people are saying is, 'We wish the Dow were something else.' I wish my 
grandfather was a millionaire." 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow Jones industrial average traces its roots to 1884, when a financial 
journalist named Charles Henry Dow needed a way to communicate changes in 
overall market prices to his readers each afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 He came up with an ingenious idea. Find a representative group of companies, 
add up the closing prices of one share of each company's stock, then divide by 
the number of companies to create an average. It was a simple formula, capable 
of being calculated quickly by hand -- a necessary ingredient in the 1800s. 
</P>
<P>
 He published this average each day to give investors an indication of market 
health -- and a report card on how their investments fared relative to the 
average. 
</P>
<P>
 Dow started out with 11 stocks, mainly railroads. But in 1928, he expanded the 
list to include 30 industrial companies -- the genesis of the Dow Jones 
industrial average. 
</P>
<P>
 Only two things about the Dow have changed over the last 66 years: 17 of the 
30 original companies and the so-called divisor. 
</P>
<P>
 The editors at the Wall Street Journal substitute companies when original Dow 
index firms drastically change their business, merge or go bankrupt. Changes 
are not made lightly, because every effort is made to keep the index 
historically significant. But Prestbo says the right move is often obvious. 
</P>
<P>
 When General Foods was bought by Philip Morris, for instance, it naturally 
fell out of the Dow 30, replaced by Philip Morris. When International Harvester 
-- once a big manufacturer of farm and construction equipment -- restructured, 
changed its name and sold the bulk of its business, it was replaced by 
Caterpillar, currently the nation's biggest manufacturer of farm equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the index is so old and so well understood, it is an unparalleled 
communication device -- capable of telegraphing significant market moves to 
everyone from Wall Street professionals to housewives. 
</P>
<P>
 At one time, the Dow was also used by professionals, who examine overall 
market trends to determine how and when to invest. But today, though 
professionals continue to quote the Dow, few use it in research. 
</P>
<P>
 "You need look no further than its composition," says Joseph Wahed, chief 
economist at Wells Fargo & Co. in San Francisco. "About 80% of those working in 
this country are in service industries. About 80% of the Dow is manufacturing. 
We are not accurately represented in the Dow." 
</P>
<P>
 Furthermore, with just 30 stocks, a strong move by one company can skew the 
index. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's crazy," says analyst Johnson. "The purpose of an index is to eliminate 
discussions about individual stocks and talk about stocks in general. With only 
30 stocks in the index, the results of very few companies affect the outcome. 
That defeats the purpose." 
</P>
<P>
 And then there's the divisor. 
</P>
<P>
 When Charles Dow started out, he was dividing per-share closing prices by the 
number of shares. But over the years, companies changed and declared stock 
splits that would have skewed the index if the divisor hadn't been adjusted. 
(Nothing changes when you split shares, giving each holder of a $100 share two 
$50 shares instead. But because the Dow index is based on per-share closing 
prices, the change could affect the value of the index.) 
</P>
<P>
 To neutralize the per-share-price effect of stock splits, the divisor is 
adjusted. The sum of the 30 Dow stocks is divided by this number. Simply put, 
as companies divide their shares, the divisor drops. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently the Dow companies' closing prices are divided by 0.3861073. 
</P>
<P>
 That fractional divisor makes the market appear more volatile than it is, some 
maintain. Why? Once the divisor dropped below 1 -- that happened one infamous 
day in 1986 -- it became a multiplier, magnifying market moves, says Robert H. 
Stovall, president of Stovall/Twenty-First Advisers Inc. and an adjunct 
professor of finance at New York University's Stern Graduate School of 
Business. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider what happens when each stock in the Dow 30 moves one point in the 
same direction. In 1928, this would have moved the index 1.8 points -- 30 
divided by 16.67. In 1986, the same change would have moved the Dow 30 points. 
Today, that same move would cause the index to swing 77.68 points -- 30 divided 
by 0.3861073. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, the Dow is much higher today than it was 10 years ago, and these 
point swings still indicate the same percentage change. Nonetheless, because 
newspapers and television broadcasts tend to report the point swings rather 
than the percentage change, some investors walk away with the idea that the 
stock market has become more volatile, says Stovall. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the New York Stock Exchange contributes to the illusion that the market 
is more volatile because of bigger point swings in the Dow. After the 1987 
crash, when the Dow fell 508 points in one day, the NYSE instituted a series of 
"circuit breakers" to limit swings in the market. These breakers impose 
temporary limits on trading, presumably to slow volatility and give investors a 
chance to cool off and reassess. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the circuit breakers is triggered by the Dow gaining or losing 50 
points from its previous close. In 1987, a 50-point move was far more 
significant than it is today. Nonetheless, the artificial break remains at the 
same spot. And an exchange spokesman says there's currently no talk about 
changing it to accommodate the diminishing Dow divisor. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the market has been unusually stable in recent years. Investors who 
focus on the Dow simply must become accustomed to double-digit moves as the Dow 
divisor continues to drop, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 There's one other numerical criticism of the Dow index: that it's based on 
stock prices, not market value. 
</P>
<P>
 What's the difference? Consider two hypothetical companies, both of equal size 
and value. For simplicity's sake, we'll say their market value -- the value of 
all their outstanding shares -- is $1 million. Company A has 1 million shares 
outstanding, so each share of stock sells for $1. But Company B has just 1,000 
shares outstanding, so each share sells for $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
 With the Dow formula, Company B gets exponentially more weight in the index 
than Company A -- even though both companies are equally important. That's 
simply because the Dow is based on the closing price of one share of each 
stock. 
</P>
<P>
 If the $1 stock gained 10% in value, the market value of that company would 
jump to $1.1 million, but the index would move only 0.26 points. If the $1,000 
stock gained 10%, it would move the index 259 points. 
</P>
<P>
 In reality, Company A and Company B don't exist. But Caterpillar, which sells 
for $108 a share, has twice the Dow-moving weight as AT&T, which sells for $55 
-- despite the fact that AT&T is six times as large and seven times as 
profitable. 
</P>
<P>
 Investors, nonetheless, need market indexes, experts say. In order to invest 
wisely, investors need a historic look at the performance of various types of 
investments. And they need a way to gauge whether they're investing wisely on 
their own or if they need an adviser. If they're using an adviser, they need a 
measurement that will grade that adviser's advice. Indexes serve all those 
purposes. 
</P>
<P>
 But if not the Dow, to which index do you turn? 
</P>
<P>
 If you've got a diversified portfolio of U.S. stocks, mutual fund managers, 
market analysts and economists recommend the Standard & Poor's 500, a 
market-value-weighted index of 500 U.S. companies. 
</P>
<P>
 What makes the S&P so popular among market professionals is the math. It 
includes so many companies that it can't be thrown off by fluctuations in just 
a few. Moreover, it's based on market value, so our hypothetical Companies A 
and B would get exactly the same weight in the index, regardless of their share 
prices. 
</P>
<P>
 Although it includes just 500 stocks, those stocks appear to be highly 
representative of the entire market. How do you know? There is another index 
that measures the market value of every listed stock -- the misnamed Wilshire 
5,000, an index currently composed of 6,723 stocks and computed by Wilshire 
Associates in Santa Monica. Over the last 20 years, the movements of the 
Wilshire 5,000 and the S&P 500 have deviated by only 0.01%, according to 
Ibbotson Associates, a Chicago-based market research and consulting firm. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a telling indicator of economic health too. Generally speaking, strong 
movements in the S&P index foretell recessions and recoveries that are between 
six months and one year in the future, according to Commerce Department 
economist Larry Moran. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are looking for series that accurately and consistently track economic 
cycles, both peaks and troughs," he says. "We can't have an index that bounces 
around, because all that noise makes it impossible to track economic cycles. We 
are not saying that the S&P is generally a better index than the Dow. But for 
our purposes -- for tracking economic cycles -- it's the better indicator." 
</P>
<P>
 Movements in the S&P 500 are considered a leading economic indicator, tracked 
by government economists since 1968. 
</P>
<P>
 But few people outside the rarefied world of Wall Street focus on the S&P. 
And, though market professionals gauge their performance based on its figures, 
most can't quote the index level at any given time. 
</P>
<P>
 Why? Opinions vary. Some say the Dow companies simply trade so constantly that 
the Dow index gives a more up-to-the-moment picture of market direction. Others 
say it's simply familiarity. You quote the Dow and everybody knows what you're 
talking about. You quote the S&P and you'll spend the rest of the afternoon 
explaining what it is. 
</P>
<P>
 Another faction believes that what some consider one of the S&P's main 
strengths -- its willingness to change -- is a weakness when it comes to public 
acceptance. S&P traces the roots of its 500-share index to 1923. But over the 
years, the number of companies in the index, the industry representation and 
the frequency of calculation have changed several times. 
</P>
<P>
 S&P started out tracking 233 stocks. But because this was before personal 
computers and sophisticated calculators, the index value was computed only once 
a week. When it was obvious that more up-to-date information was needed, S&P 
culled its universe to 90 stocks, which was updated daily. The company 
continued to track the larger 233-share index on a weekly basis and added 
companies into the formula. There were 416 companies in 1941 and 500 companies 
in 1957: 425 industrials, 60 utilities and 15 railroads. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1976, the industry mix was changed to exclude some industrials and 
utilities and add more financial, transportation and "mid-cap" stocks. In 1988, 
the mix was changed again to "relax" the fixed structure that allowed only so 
many companies in each industry group. The advent of "merger mania" had created 
many hard-to-define conglomerates, S&P said. 
</P>
<P>
 Notably, the 500 companies in the S&P index are not necessarily the biggest 
companies in the nation. The index is constructed "bottom up" by industry group 
and is designed to mirror corporate America -- so there are many relatively 
small companies included. 
</P>
<P>
 All of this makes the S&P a great indicator of overall market -- and economic 
-- health. But it has made it a bit harder for individuals to understand the 
exact nature of the index. 
</P>
<P>
 Do you use it to gauge the performance of your big-company stocks? 
Small-company stocks? Or just to measure the value of your mutual funds? 
</P>
<P>
 The S&P is particularly helpful to measure the performance of diversified 
equity mutual funds, professionals say. 
</P>
<P>
 But if you're investing in small companies, growth funds or mid-cap companies 
-- with sales ranging between $1 billion and $2 billion, the S&P 500 can be 
misleading. Why? It's weighted by market value. So big companies have far more 
weight in the index than do small companies. 
</P>
<P>
 In other words, all the little companies in the index could be doing great -- 
or pushing up daisies -- and the index would barely shift. 
</P>
<P>
 S&P and other professionals argue that weighting an index by market value is 
the right way to go. But it means that investors in small companies need to 
watch another index, such as the Russell 2,000 or the Nasdaq composite, which 
are made up primarily of small growth companies. 
</P>
<P>
 That's important because big companies and small companies react to market and 
economic news in somewhat different ways. Over time, all stock indexes tend to 
rise, reflecting growth in the overall economy. And, generally speaking, 
economic upheaval hurts all stocks, large and small. But growth companies are 
more volatile, swinging up with greater force in economic recoveries and 
plunging more steeply when the economy hits the skids, notes Mark W. Riepe, 
vice president of Ibbotson Associates. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, when the economy started sliding into recession in late 1990, the 
Dow industrial average fell 4.3% for the year and the S&P 500 slid 6.6%. But 
the Nasdaq composite plunged 17.8%. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, as the economy showed signs of life, the Nasdaq soared, 
posting far stronger gains than the big-company indexes. How It Works 
</P>
<P>
 Thirty of the biggest, best-known American stocks make up the granddaddy of 
all market indexes: the Dow Jones industrial average. But as closely as the Dow 
is watched, few understand how it's calculated. It isn't the sum of prices of 
its component stocks. Instead, each stock's contribution to the average is 
weighted by its per-share price. That means a small company can move the Dow 
more than a bigger company, if the smaller firm has few outstanding shares and 
a high-per share price. For example, AT&T is six times bigger than Caterpillar 
and more than seven times as profitable. But Caterpillar, because it sells for 
double AT&T's share price, accounts for double the number of points in the Dow. 
This chart shows the 30 Dow stocks and their respective weights in the index as 
of Friday, July 29. Company: Points of the dow AT&T: 141.48 Allied Signal: 
99.06 Alcoa: 202.66 American Express: 68.63 Bethlehem Steel: 57.63 Boeing: 
115.58 Caterpillar: 280.67 Chevron: 114.93 CocaCola: 114.93 Disney: 109.75 
DuPont: 153.78 Eastman Kodak: 125.29 Exxon: 154.10 General Electric: 130.47 
General Motors: 133.06 Goodyear: 92.27 IBM: 160.25 International Paper: 188.74 
McDonalds: 70.25 Merck: 76.73 Minnesota Mining & Manufacturing: 137.59 J.P. 
Morgan: 163.17 Philip Morris: 142.45 Proctor & Gamble: 144.39 Sears: 122.37 
Texaco: 164.46 Union Carbide: 73.17 United Technologies: 156.04 Westinghouse: 
31.40 Woolworth: 39.17 Dow Total: 3764.50 * through July 29 Confusing Signals 
</P>
<P>
 Because the Dow is made up of just 30 stocks, a strong move by just one 
company can skew the index. Consider what happened on July 21, when IBM shares 
rocketed $6.50 -- or nearly 12% -- on the strength of a strong earnings report. 
Change in the Dow Jones average: +5.18 points Increase attributed to IBM: 
+16.83 points What would have happened to the average if IBM were excluded: 
-11.65 points 
</P>
<P>
 Experts say the Dow also exaggerates apparent market volatility. That's 
because the "divisor" -- the number by which Dow closing stock prices are 
divided to create the average -- has shrunk over the years to less than 1. When 
you divide by a fraction, the result is a larger number. So the calculation 
amplifies the apparent size of market moves rather than moderating them. In 
past years when the divisor was 1 or greater, the math worked out differently. 
These figures show the impact over the years of a $1 gain in each Dow stock. 
Date: Impact of a $1-per-stock gain Oct., 1928: +1.8 points April, 1986: +30 
points July, 1994: +77.68 points Dueling Indexes 
</P>
<P>
 Market performance varies widely depending on the index you watch. The Dow 
Jones industrial average and the Standard & Poor's 500 are both "big company" 
averages, for instance, but their results can differ greatly. When the Dow lost 
ground in 1984, the S&P was up slightly. When the Dow posted a double-digit 
gain last year, the S&P was up far more modestly. The NASDAQ composite index, 
which measures small-company stock performance, shows even bigger disparities.

JAMES FLANIGAN: THE PERILS AND PROMISE OF MEXICO'S NEW ECONOMY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES FLANIGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two weeks before Mexico's presidential election Aug. 21, uncertainty clouds 
its economy. The peso is under pressure and the Mexican government is forced to 
borrow in dollars to keep essential foreign investment in the country. 
</P>
<P>
 The first year of the North American Free Trade Agreement has swelled Mexico's 
trade deficit -- the "giant sucking sound down south" that Ross Perot predicted 
has turned out to be Mexico's developing economy pulling in imports from the 
United States. As industrial machinery and passenger cars flow south of the 
border, Mexico's trade deficit could increase more than 20% this year, despite 
rising exports. 
</P>
<P>
 Election worries and peso weakness have driven up interest rates. Mexican 
government notes are above 15% and small business must borrow at 25% and more. 
Not surprisingly, economic growth is slow. 
</P>
<P>
 Many Americans will shrug at such news, and say they can never make sense of 
the economy to the south. But smarter Americans will be concerned and want to 
understand the perils and the promise of an economy that represents probably 
the greatest opportunity for U.S. industry in the world today. 
</P>
<P>
 They should look to Monterrey, this mountain-ringed city of 4 million people 
140 miles south of Laredo, Tex., that is home to 7,000 manufacturing companies, 
including four of the five largest corporations in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 In Monterrey lie answers to such vexing questions as why $2 an hour labor does 
not mean competitive industry in today's world. And how the Mexican people, now 
working in an economy in which the minimum wage is $6 a day, can hope to lift 
themselves to a standard of living on a par with that of Germany or Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 Alfa Corp., a Monterrey company with $2.35 billion annual sales in steel, 
petrochemicals, food, auto parts and diverse businesses, will open a 
$400-million steel mini-mill in December. 
</P>
<P>
 The new mill will employ the latest technology, some of it bought from Nucor 
Corp., the U.S. steel producer. And it will allow Alfa, whose mill workers make 
$2 to $3 an hour, to produce steel almost as cheaply as Nucor's Arkansas plant, 
where the average pay is $16 an hour. 
</P>
<P>
 But wait a minute, why doesn't two bucks an hour beat $16 hands down? 
"Infrastructure," explains Enrique Flores, an Alfa vice president of finance. 
"Electrical energy costs more in Mexico, the railroads are less efficient than 
in the United States, our roads and ports are not as good." Add it all up and 
you understand the drawbacks that keep developing countries poor. 
</P>
<P>
 That is what Mexico is trying to change with investments in roads, railroads 
and public facilities. Private investors built a toll road from Monterrey to 
the U.S. border at Laredo to help move goods faster and increase productivity 
in the economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Such investments can create a virtuous circle: 72% of Alfa's steel, for 
example, goes to construction projects. If construction of better roads and 
more efficient plants can reduce infrastructure drawbacks, Alfa's workers can 
produce steel less expensively leaving more money in the economy for other 
purposes. Among those purposes would be higher wages for the steelworkers, who 
could then make Mexico's potentially vast consumer market more of a reality 
than it is today. 
</P>
<P>
 Many companies, U.S. and Mexican, are betting the consumer market will 
materialize. "Alfa is investing $80 million to $100 million a year in polyester 
for plastic bottles," says Juan Luis San Jose, director of planning for Alfa's 
petrochemicals division. Plastic bottle use is on the rise in Mexico, which is 
second only to the United States in per capita consumption of soft drinks. 
</P>
<P>
 Alfa also is investing in a joint venture with Payless Cashways of Kansas City 
to bring do-it-yourself hardware stores to Mexico. The company plans to open 25 
stores in this decade, according to a report by D.A. Campbell & Co., a Los 
Angeles brokerage that specializes in Mexican securities. Other firms, with 
names like Home Mart and Builders Mart, are also bringing U.S.-style hardware 
to Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 Do-it-yourself could be a booming business as rates for skilled tradesmen 
climb -- even now plumbers command $20 a day in Mexico -- and if more Mexicans 
become homeowners. But that's a big if. There are almost no housing loans in 
Mexico, where mortgages can be for terms as short as two years and interest 
rates are prohibitive. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet today's young Mexicans are filled with expectations of change. Mexico's 
population is so young that fully one-third of its people are in school. In the 
Aug. 21 election, half the electorate will be voting for the first time. And 
those voters want what everybody in the world wants today, jobs and houses and 
lawn mowers and mortgages. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, it was to give its young people and companies access to the world's 
low interest rates that Mexico's government proposed NAFTA in the first place. 
Global interest rates are 7% and below, while rates in a land of underdeveloped 
capital like Mexico are three and four times higher. 
</P>
<P>
 That's one reason Mexico is borrowing by issuing dollar obligations notes, at 
about 7.25%, rather than peso notes at about 16%. (Another reason is that 
investors fear peso devaluation after the election.) 
</P>
<P>
 The promise of Mexico today is that its people can earn a better life by 
becoming more productive. 
</P>
<P>
 The peril is that Mexico has opened its economy to more competitive global 
products before its own industries and infrastructure are able to cope. The 
world's goods are flooding in now and as Mexico's young consumers rush to buy 
them the danger is of renewed inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 There are no easy answers for Mexico. Devaluation of the peso could cause more 
problems than it would solve. And the election won't be the answer to every 
prayer but simply another landmark in Mexico's long development. 
</P>
<P>
 "We Americans should wish that Mexico succeeds," says Tom Frost, chairman of 
Cullen/Frost Bankers Inc. of San Antonio, Tex., who first went to work in 
Mexico 44 years ago to gain experience. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're an old country, those over 65 will be an expanding age group," Frost 
says, "while Mexico is a very young country. If I were making goods, I couldn't 
avoid going to Mexico because that's where the future market will be." That's 
true, even though Mexico's future is clouded with uncertainty today.

TIMES BOARD OF ADVISERS / ROBERT EISNER: WHAT'S SO TERRIBLE ABOUT EMPLOYERS 
HELPING WITH HEALTH CARE? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT EISNER, ROBERT EISNER is William R. Kenan professor of economics at 
Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill. He is the author of The Misunderstood 
Economy: What Counts and How to Count It. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The simplest way to reform health care and to make coverage universal is 
clearly the "single-payer" system. As with Social Security, unemployment 
insurance, Medicare and Medicaid, health "insurance" would be provided by the 
government. "Premiums" could be collected from employees, employers and 
taxpayers generally; benefits would be paid out by the U.S. Treasury. There is 
every reason to believe that the added government red tape and bureaucracy 
would be far less than that imposed today by private insurance companies so 
bedeviling patients, hospitals, doctors and other health practitioners. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Clinton Administration decided not to buck the multibillion-dollar 
insurance industry and instead has proposed building on what we have: health 
insurance purchased by employers. 
</P>
<P>
 This is, after all, the conservative way to proceed. Other than the aged under 
Medicare and the poor under Medicaid, the bulk of those currently enjoying 
health insurance are in plans paid for by their employers. The Clinton 
recommendations have been to extend the employer-paid health insurance we 
already have to all employers, except those with very small numbers of workers. 
And for small employers, there would be government subsidies to help with the 
costs. 
</P>
<P>
 What, then, is the huge furor being drummed up in some quarters against 
"employer mandates"? We already have employer "mandates" to contribute to 
Social Security and unemployment insurance. And employers contribute now to 
health insurance for some 83% of the employees of firms with 100 or more 
workers and 71% of employees in firms with fewer than 100 workers. This has 
hardly wrecked American business or created mass unemployment. 
</P>
<P>
 What is so terrible about asking employers to contribute to the health 
insurance of all employees who are not yet covered, thus reaching the bulk of 
the 15% or 20% of the American people with no health insurance at all? 
</P>
<P>
 The main argument is that a mandate will fatally raise labor costs, 
particularly for small business, driving them out of business or forcing them 
to lay off workers. But however loudly that argument is repeated, it is 
fundamentally flawed. 
</P>
<P>
 To begin with, it is very doubtful that the provision of health insurance will 
raise labor costs at all. There are millions of workers and potential workers 
who are desperate to acquire affordable health insurance. They would add to the 
supply of labor available to small business and in the main would be willing to 
work for lower wages or forgo wage increases to get health insurance. Total 
labor costs -- wages plus health care expenses -- need be no more than wages 
without health care today. 
</P>
<P>
 Second, even if labor costs were raised for those employers forced to meet 
health expenses for the first time, they would be raised as well for their 
competitors in the same situation. In that case, they would have every 
opportunity to raise their prices -- and free-market forces would bring exactly 
that result. Since labor costs are far from the only cost of business, the 
price increases would be modest. There would be no squeeze on profits, little 
or no loss of sales and no reason to either "go out of business" or lay off 
workers. 
</P>
<P>
 So, small businesses imagining that health insurance mandates would impose 
impossible burdens can only be calculating that they alone would bear the added 
costs. Since their competitors would also be forced to contribute, they would 
not be worse off. And with the government subsidizing small employers and 
insisting that, unlike now, lower-cost health insurance be available to small 
business, as it is generally today to big business with great bargaining power, 
small business would probably be better off. 
</P>
<P>
 The one argument that some businesses might have for not paying for health 
insurance is that they can enjoy a competitive advantage over those that do. 
But if that is the argument, it is surely unacceptable. Why should we allow 
some businesses to benefit at the expense of all those that do provide health 
care? When we do, we force the rest of us, including the businesses paying for 
health care, to meet the added expenses of those who are not covered. When 
hospitals offer expensive, and often belated, emergency room care to those who, 
for lack of coverage, did not get medical attention in time, they are driving 
up the insurance costs for all of the rest of us. 
</P>
<P>
 A single-payer plan, as in Canada, might well be better. But we have that in 
the United States now only for the poor and the aged. The Clinton 
Administration has decided that states may opt to institute such plans (indeed, 
Californians will vote in November on Proposition 186, which would do just 
that) but the vested interests opposed to making single-payer universal are 
just too great. It will be a sad day if ignorance, confusion, political 
partisanship and bad economics stop as well the President's conservative 
alternative of extending our current employer-financed private insurance to 
provide for the tens of millions of middle-class working Americans who now are 
left out.

NEWCOMERS HOPING FOR ELECTRONICS EMPLOYMENT FIND A CHANGED MARKET; JOBS: 
ONCE-PLENTIFUL ASSEMBLY WORK, POPULAR AMONG IMMIGRANTS, HAS BECOME SCARCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON LEE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ask Tho Phan what job he is seeking, and the 21-year-old newcomer from Vietnam 
provides a quick answer. "Electrical assembly," he says, his boyish face 
beaming. "I want the job with electrical assembly." 
</P>
<P>
 It may not seem like a dream job, but even before arriving in Orange County 
four months ago, Phan had heard reports of compatriots who found work in 
electronics assembly and turned them into careers, moving up to positions as 
inspectors, technicians and supervisors. He had heard that electronics plants 
hire unskilled workers who speak little English and that they pay much better 
than the low-wage jobs available in hotels, restaurants and other service 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can work in restaurant," Phan said between English classes at the St. 
Anselm Cross-Cultural Community Center in Garden Grove, which is helping him 
find work. Phan frowns at that thought, then quickly adds, "I want electrical 
company." 
</P>
<P>
 The stories Phan heard were true a few years ago, but the market for those 
jobs today in Southern California has changed a lot. Once-plentiful openings in 
electronics assembly are now scarce in Orange County, a region long known as a 
high-tech manufacturing center. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the work fell victim to the recession, deep cuts in aerospace, factory 
automation and manufacturing plants' moves to places such as Texas and Mexico. 
Although the local economy shows signs of resurgence, those electronics 
assembly jobs will probably never return, analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
 "Robots and machines are now doing what human beings did, so there's a 
tendency for these assembly jobs not to come back even if the economy starts 
showing strong expansion," says Esmael Adibi, an economist at Chapman 
University in Orange. 
</P>
<P>
 The erosion of electronics assembly employment is a nationwide trend. The jobs 
have been in decline since the mid-1980s, when they hit a peak of 360,000, 
according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. By 1993, the number had fallen to 
315,000, a drop of nearly 13%. 
</P>
<P>
 An exact tally of the electronics assembly jobs lost in Orange County is not 
available, but industry data suggests that the percentage has been even higher. 
Between 1988 and last May, Orange County lost 35% of its employment -- or 
13,200 jobs -- in the electronic equipment industry, a major employer of 
electronics assemblers.  
</P>
<P>
 The loss has hit new arrivals the hardest, especially Asian and Latino 
immigrants and refugees. 
</P>
<P>
 Asians in particular have preferred electronics assembly work to restaurant or 
hotel jobs, said Marianne Blank, executive director at St. Anselm's community 
center, a nonprofit group that has helped thousands of refugees, most from 
Southeast Asia, find jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's technical, and they could write home and be proud of it," she said, 
"even if all they were doing was sitting and pushing buttons all day." 
</P>
<P>
 But now, Blank says, many are having to settle for minimum-wage jobs sewing 
shirts or packing medicine into cartons. "It's been very devastating," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Electronics assemblers typically learn on the job. Their work includes reading 
diagrams, soldering, fabricating and fastening components such as capacitors. 
The jobs pay an average of only about $7 an hour, but most companies also 
provide medical insurance and other benefits, private and state-sponsored 
surveys show. 
</P>
<P>
 Aerospace companies have also eliminated hundreds of their own assembly jobs 
in recent years, and more layoffs could be on the way. 
</P>
<P>
 Hughes Aircraft, for example, has laid off about 100 assemblers at its 
Fullerton plant in the past year and is considering closing the factory 
altogether. If it does, another 250 electronics assemblers would be out of 
work, union officials say. A decision is expected later this month. 
</P>
<P>
 Elmer Batac, 36, says he was among 40 Hughes workers in Fullerton who were 
laid off in May. The company hired him as an electronics assembler in 1981, two 
years after he arrived in California from the Philippines. 
</P>
<P>
 "The job provided me with a good livelihood," Batac says, noting that by the 
time he was laid off, he was making more than $14 an hour. Now, Batac says, he 
is considering leaving the state and going into nursing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Electronics assembly, it's sad," Batac says. "We need a war to get these jobs 
back." 
</P>
<P>
 Manufacturers of computer hardware products also employ electronics 
assemblers, and a few have been adding workers. But many others have cut back. 
Last year, for example, Helix Circuits and Diceon Electronics, both 
manufacturers of printed circuit boards in Irvine, closed plants that together 
eliminated more than 200 assembly jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 "The likelihood of (future) hiring is pretty slim," says a spokeswoman for ITT 
Cannon, a Santa Ana maker of electronic connectors, echoing comments made by 
other small and large electronics companies in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Thomas, vice president of Microsemi Corp., a maker of semiconductors in 
Santa Ana, remembers when times were different. Through the booming 1970s and 
up until the late '80s, he says, electronics assembly openings were so abundant 
that "we were begging people to work." 
</P>
<P>
 But when the defense industry began retrenching a few years ago, Microsemi's 
orders suffered, and in January, 1992, Thomas says, the company eliminated 
about 100 local assembly jobs. Since then, he says, Microsemi's overall 
employment in Santa Ana has held steady at about 425. Of those 44% are Asian, 
mostly Vietnamese, and another 30% are Latino. 
</P>
<P>
 Alicia Menendez, 39, is one of the lucky ones. She got an assembler's job at 
Microsemi during a hiring boom in May, 1980, a year after arriving in Santa Ana 
from Uruapan, Mexico. She was 24 at the time, she says, and "my whole fortune" 
was a suitcase of clothes and the $450 she had saved over the years working as 
a secretary in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 Menendez has been promoted several times since then -- to lead worker, 
inspector and supervisor. She is now a quality-control supervisor and makes 
$13.90 an hour, and she and her husband, a print shop worker, were able to buy 
a four-bedroom house in Chino for themselves and their three children. 
</P>
<P>
 Queenie Phu is another Microsemi employee who started as an assembler and 
worked her way up to a better-paying office job. Phu, a native of China, came 
to Microsemi in 1980, two years after arriving in the United States from 
Vietnam. She says: "I did not know much English, and I had no background in 
electronics. At first I didn't know what I was doing." 
</P>
<P>
 "I was lucky," she says. "Long time ago, there was such a big demand for 
electrical workers. They gave me an interview, and I went to work right away." 
</P>
<P>
 Phu says the job helped her adjust to life here because she had friends and 
co-workers at the plant who spoke Vietnamese and Chinese, and she could feel 
comfortable bringing ethnic food into the company lunchroom. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Thomas says, the Microsemi plant has just one opening for an 
assembly-type job, and the competition is intense. "We get a hundred 
applications a day for that single job," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 The steady loss of electronics jobs has forced other changes. 
</P>
<P>
 At vocational schools, Asians and Latinos who once might have signed up for 
three months of electronics assembly training are now preparing for careers in 
computer science or library science, program directors say. 
</P>
<P>
 Ewing Taylor, a 15-year electronics instructor at Rancho Santiago College in 
Santa Ana remembers his typical class in the 1980s. "At that time, 85% were 
Asians, and they went straight to assembly," he says. "There were jobs then, 
and it meant immediate employment at above-minimum wage." 
</P>
<P>
 These days Taylor sees fewer Asian students, and he says that "most of them 
are looking to go on to four-year colleges." 
</P>
<P>
 But there are still hundreds of new arrivals clinging to dreams of a job 
market that is no more. Most find nothing but bitter disappointment. 
</P>
<P>
 Dung Trinh, 28, of Westminster is among them. 
</P>
<P>
 Trinh, a relative newcomer from Vietnam, last year quit his part-time 
electronics job in Corona because he wanted more work. 
</P>
<P>
 Ever since, Trinh has been looking hard for another assembly job but has come 
up empty. 
</P>
<P>
 "In Vietnam, I repair fans," he says. "I look for four, five months for job. 
But companies (are not) hiring."

MUTUAL FUNDS / RUSS WILES: MANY FIND THE LANGUAGE OF INVESTING CONFUSING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUSS WILES, RUSS WILES, a financial writer for the Arizona Republic, 
specializes in mutual funds. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One of the main reasons many people find mutual funds confusing probably has 
to do with the language of investing. 
</P>
<P>
 We're not talking about simple terms and concepts here. Many financial words 
and phrases are fairly challenging. A few lie somewhere between vague and 
misleading. Consider the following examples: 
</P>
<P>
 * "Securities." This is one of the most basic financial terms, but it's a 
confusing one. Generally speaking, a security is a paper-based investment, 
typically regulated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission -- things 
like stocks, bonds and mutual funds but not real estate or rare coins. 
</P>
<P>
 What makes the word troublesome is that there's nothing especially "secure" 
about most securities. Even the prices of U.S. government bonds can gyrate 
wildly. But some of the safest financial instruments around -- namely, 
government-insured bank accounts -- aren't securities. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Value-added." This seems to be a favorite term among many brokers and 
financial planners looking for ways to justify the commissions they charge. 
Example used in a sentence: "We offer a value-added approach that you just 
can't get with the discounters and no-load funds." 
</P>
<P>
 However, most securities (see above) are essentially the same, whether 
purchased through a full-service or discount brokerage or managed by a load or 
no-load fund family. What "value added" usually boils down to is "advice and 
hand holding through scary markets," two legitimate services provided by 
brokers, even if they don't like to phrase them as such. 
</P>
<P>
 * "No load." Too bad this term is a double negative, because the concept 
behind it is great. No-load mutual funds are those that can be purchased 
directly by do-it-yourself investors who don't feel they need the value-added 
help (see above) offered by a broker, and who thus want to avoid paying a sales 
charge. 
</P>
<P>
 In other words, no-load funds are "commission-free" products, a more telling 
and upbeat description. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Net-asset value." This is merely a fund's price per share, excluding any 
load (see above), if applicable. How "price" got transformed into "net-asset 
value" can only be explained by the fact that the mutual fund industry is run 
by securities (see above) lawyers. By now, you should be noticing how all of 
these financial terms fit together. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Non-diversified fund." Studies have shown that with as few as a couple of 
dozen stocks, you can achieve a decent amount of risk-reducing diversification. 
So how can it be that some mutual funds might hold two or three dozen stocks 
yet still be branded as "non-diversified" -- a dirty word in the business. 
</P>
<P>
 Again, the answer lies with those pesky securities lawyers, who follow an 
arbitrary definition of mutual fund diversification that is too complex to be 
cited here. 
</P>
<P>
 Suffice to say that "non-diversified" funds aren't necessarily riskier than 
diversified funds. Most such portfolios hold at least a couple of dozen stocks; 
above that level, factors such as the types of stocks held and management's 
competency weigh much more heavily than the actual head count. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Fixed income." This phrase describes bond market investments. It's 
misleading because not all such investments pay a fixed rate of income -- 
zero-coupon bonds, mortgage-backed securities, bonds denominated in foreign 
currencies and bond mutual funds spring to mind. 
</P>
<P>
 And with the exception of government bonds, any fixed income you receive 
certainly isn't guaranteed. Worse, you might assume that the "fixed" part also 
applies to your principal -- a dangerous assumption. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Closed-end." Technically, regular mutual funds are called "open-end" funds 
because they must stand ready to accept new investors or cash out existing 
shareholders. Closed-end funds, by contrast, don't deal with the public in this 
manner. They issue a fixed number of shares in a single transaction, after 
which investors essentially do their buying and selling from one another in the 
stock market. Depending on the confidence in the fund managers, the shares may 
sell above or below the current value of the underlying shares. 
</P>
<P>
 The terminology gets hairy when you consider that closed-end portfolios are 
always open, in the sense that you can always purchase shares that somebody 
else has to sell. But open-end funds sometimes "close," or shut their doors to 
new buyers. This happens when the portfolio manager fears the fund might get 
too big to run effectively. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, you may encounter a closed open-end fund, but not a closed closed-end 
fund. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Emerging markets." This euphemism almost certainly was dreamed up by some 
mutual fund company's marketing department. 
</P>
<P>
 Emerging markets are Third World stock exchanges that have been noticed within 
the past few years. These markets tend to be situated in countries where the 
inhabitants have finally discovered the joys of paved roads and telephones -- 
the communications theme is always big with emerging-markets fund managers. 
</P>
<P>
 In fairness, many developing economies are growing rapidly, which makes them 
good places to invest a portion of your long-term money. But the 
"emerging-markets" nomenclature glosses over the white-knuckle volatility that 
swamps these markets from time to time. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Once you master the nuances of investment English in terms such as these, you 
will be halfway there. Unfortunately, the second half is a bit more troublesome 
-- it involves mutual fund math. Test Your Vocabulary 
</P>
<P>
 Think you could define most key mutual fund words and phrases, or at least 
well enough to survive a cocktail party discussion? Try out your skill on the 
following terms.

</P>
<P>
 (b) a fund buys and sells stocks or bonds 
</P>
<P>
 (c) fund managers are hired and fired

<P>
 (a) investors give up and sell their shares 
</P>
<P>
 (b) the fund company gives up and closes a fund 
</P>
<P>
 (c) load fund investors pay a reduced commission 
</P>
<P>
 4. In investing, "bottoms up" would describe: 
</P>
<P>
 (a) the approach of a manager who tries to time the market 
</P>
<P>
 (b) the approach of a manager who buys promising stocks without worrying about 
the market's direction 
</P>
<P>
 (c) a description of funds that rise from the bottom to the top of performance 
charts in a single quarter 
</P>
<P>
 5. "Investment grade" describes: 
</P>
<P>
 (a) funds certified by the Securities and Exchange Commission 
</P>
<P>
 (b) funds given at least three stars by Morningstar Inc. 
</P>
<P>

PERSONAL FINANCE / KATHY M. KRISTOF: HOW TO MAXIMIZE YOUR SOCIAL SECURITY 
BENEFITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHY M. KRISTOF 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Every year, roughly 1 million retirees face the same troubling question: 
Should they wait until age 65 to claim their Social Security benefits or do 
they claim benefits earlier? 
</P>
<P>
 If they wait, they get more. But does the extra amount make up for the cost of 
waiting? There is great debate, with some experts urging retirees to "go for 
the gold" as soon as possible, while others argue that given today's long life 
spans, you're better off waiting. 
</P>
<P>
 So what's the right answer? Both. Or rather, either answer could be right 
depending on your circumstances. That's because Social Security is highly 
complex and a variety of factors will determine what the best answer is for 
you, says J. Robert Treanor, manager of the Social Security division at the 
employee benefits consulting firm of William M. Mercer Inc. in Louisville. 
</P>
<P>
 Here are some answers to questions about those factors and how they affect 
your benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. How are Social Security benefits calculated? 
</P>
<P>
 A. You need 40 quarters of work to qualify for benefits on your own account. 
Your benefits are calculated based on your average lifetime earnings. 
</P>
<P>
 Recent work years carry more weight in the benefit calculation, both because 
inflation has boosted earnings and because you're paying more Social Security 
tax today than you did decades ago. In 1953, for example, the maximum annual 
Social Security tax amounted to $54. Now it's more than $5,500. 
</P>
<P>
 Then the benefit amount varies based on when you take benefits -- at age 62, 
65 or later. In short, the longer you wait, the more you get each month. But 
when you wait, you obviously miss out on a number of Social Security checks. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. How much less do I get when I retire early? 
</P>
<P>
 A. Your benefits are reduced by 5/9 of one percentage point for every month 
that you get benefits before your 65th birthday. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider a hypothetical retiree, Sam, who is due $1,000 monthly at age 65. He 
would get about $933 if he elected to take benefits at age 64 and about $866 if 
he took the benefits at age 63. If he claimed Social Security in the first 
month possible -- one month after his 62nd birthday -- he'd get $805, says 
Treanor. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Is the benefit increased to the full $1,000 at age 65? 
</P>
<P>
 A. No. It's permanently reduced. Sam will receive just $805 monthly for the 
rest of his life. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. What about spousal benefits? Are they also reduced when the primary wage 
earner retires early? 
</P>
<P>
 A. No. Spouses are entitled to 50% of the primary wage earner's full insurance 
benefit, assuming that the spouse starts taking benefits at "normal retirement 
age" -- that's currently age 65. But if the spouse also elects to take benefits 
early, the spousal benefits are reduced by 25/36 for every month before age 65 
that they're claimed. In other words, if Sam's wife, Helen, elects to take 
benefits at age 62, her $500 spousal benefit would be reduced by 25%, or $125. 
She'd get $375. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. What if Helen's own benefits would be worth more than $500? 
</P>
<P>
 A. Then she'd take benefits based on her own work record, not her husband's. 
And if she retired early, her benefits would be reduced by the 5/9 of one 
percentage point for every month before age 65 that she claimed Social 
Security, rather than the more costly 25/36 spousal calculation. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. If you're going to get 20% or 25% more for the rest of your life by waiting 
just a few years, wouldn't you be wise to wait? 
</P>
<P>
 A. Not unless you live a very long time, says David Hemstreet, a 
Pasadena-based financial planner. 
</P>
<P>
 Let's go back to Sam's case to illustrate why. He takes the reduced benefits 
of $805 monthly and collects those checks for an extra 35 months. At age 65, 
he's already collected $28,175. 
</P>
<P>
 His full benefits would be $195 more a month. But it would take 12 years, or 
144 months, to collect the same $28,175, says Treanor. 
</P>
<P>
 Additionally, if you assume that Sam invests his $805 at an average annual 
rate of 8%, he would be 83 before he broke even by waiting to take benefits at 
age 62, Hemstreet adds. If his investment earnings are less, of course, the 
break-even point would come a bit sooner; if his investments earn more, he'd be 
older before breaking even.

 Q. What if you don't invest the money -- you simply use it to pay your bills? 
</P>
<P>
 A. Then the break-even point is at age 77 when you've collected the $28,175 
through boosted benefits that you would have collected in the three year-span 
between ages 62 and 65.

<P>
 Q. You never know how long you're going to live, so how can you determine 
which answer generates the best result? 
</P>
<P>
 A. If Willard Scott is consistently broadcasting birthday greetings to your 
100-year-old relatives, you probably ought to wait -- assuming, of course, you 
have the luxury of waiting because you don't need the money to pay your bills. 
But if your family's longevity isn't anything to crow about, you're probably 
better off by claiming Social Security the moment you're eligible.

MONEY TALK / CARLA LAZZARESCHI: KEEP EMERGENCY MONEY SEPARATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLA LAZZARESCHI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Q. I understand that families should keep cash on hand for emergencies equal 
to three to six months of living expenses. I have also read that a family's 
investment portfolio should be diversified among stocks, bonds, real estate and 
other holdings. 
</P>
<P>
 What I have never understood is whether the portfolio should be accumulated 
after the emergency account is funded or whether the portfolio includes the 
emergency funds. Please advise. -- P.H.  
</P>
<P>
 A. Conservatively speaking, money reserved for emergencies is not considered a 
true part of a family's investment portfolio. 
</P>
<P>
 Any money set aside for emergencies should be kept in accounts that are both 
easily accessible and not subject to the ups and downs of the market. 
</P>
<P>
 This leaves you few options, virtually all of which pay minimal interest: bank 
accounts, money market accounts and certificates of deposit with staggered 
maturities. 
</P>
<P>
 You aren't likely to get rich on such investments; in fact, they may barely 
keep pace with inflation. But they are very liquid and you won't have to worry 
whether the stock market is in a bull or bear cycle if you need to tap the 
account. The idea is to have ready cash in the event of an accident, illness or 
other dire circumstance. 
</P>
<P>
 Your investment portfolio is an entirely separate matter. This should be 
diversified among a variety of investments -- stocks, bonds, real estate and 
other holdings. The mix should vary according to your age and investment goals. 
</P>
<P>
 You should review your holdings regularly to be sure the portfolio is in 
balance with savings goals that change as you age. You may start out saving for 
a home purchase. Your children's education may be your next major objective, 
then it's on to retirement savings. 
</P>
<P>
 You can find any number of thoughtful books on this subject at your local 
library or bookstore. And a qualified, trusted financial counselor -- and I 
would recommend only for-fee planners -- can help you plot your course. Will 
Children Have to Pay Parent's Debts? 
</P>
<P>
 Q. I am 78 years old with no estate and outstanding credit card balances 
totaling more than $20,000. When I die, will my children be required to pay off 
these debts? -- J.K.  
</P>
<P>
 A. Your children will be required to pay off your debts with any assets from 
your estate. If your estate is nonexistent or minimal, any remaining debts not 
covered by the estate's proceeds would not become the obligation of your 
children. Tax Code Treats Spouse as Having Pension Plan 
</P>
<P>
 Q. I am not covered by a pension plan at work. My husband is covered by one. 
Am I entitled to make a tax-deductible contribution to an individual retirement 
account on my own? I know my husband is not entitled to a tax-deductible 
contribution, but I think I should be. -- M.A.E.  
</P>
<P>
 A. The government allows taxpayers to make tax-deductible IRA contributions if 
they meet either one of two requirements: They do not participate in a 
qualified pension plan through their employment or they do participate in such 
a plan but their earnings are low enough that they are permitted a tax 
deduction for their retirement savings. 
</P>
<P>
 However, even though you are not covered by a pension plan through your job, 
you are not entitled to make a tax-deductible IRA contribution unless your 
combined family income meets the federal guidelines for such contributions. 
Why? Because your husband is covered by a qualified plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the reasoning of the tax code, if one spouse is covered by a pension 
plan, the married couple is treated as though both spouses are covered. The 
logic -- if that word can be applied -- is supposed to take into account 
community property laws and the fact that spouses generally benefit from the 
other's pension plan. In reality, however, this is just another example of what 
many consider to be the "marriage penalty" imposed by the nation's tax laws. 
</P>
<P>
 For you to enjoy a fully tax-deductible IRA contribution, your combined family 
adjusted gross income may not exceed $40,000. The deduction decreases gradually 
until ending completely at an adjusted gross income of $50,000. Tax 
Consequences of Parent-to-Child Loans 
</P>
<P>
 Q. In a recent column you discussed no-interest loans from parents to 
children. You said such loans are permitted without tax consequences if the 
loans are less than $100,000 and the recipient had no investment income. Does 
it matter what the loan is used for? I want to lend my son some money so he can 
buy an interest in a business operation. Would this qualify as a "no tax 
consequences" transaction? -- W.J.G.  
</P>
<P>
 A. How the proceeds of a loan between parent and child are used are of no 
consequence. What matters is whether the borrower has investment income. 
</P>
<P>
 If the borrower has investment income, the loan must carry an interest rate 
equal to or greater than the "applicable federal rate," an amount that floats 
with the market and is set every six months. 
</P>
<P>
 If the lender charges less than that rate (and the borrower has investment 
income), the forgone interest would be considered a gift from the lender and 
deducted from his or her lifetime gift limit of $600,000. The lender would also 
be required to claim as his or her own income the amount of interest the son 
receives on his investments. 
</P>
<P>
 If your son receives no interest income from investments, you may lend him up 
to $100,000 and charge less than the applicable federal rate (or even no 
interest at all) with no gift tax or income tax consequences. 
</P>
<P>
 Again, it does not matter how the loan proceeds are used -- except, of course, 
if they are spent on investments that generate interest. Any purchase of an 
ongoing business operation should be structured to generate income -- not 
interest -- for your son.

INVENTOR FAMILY FACED LEAN TIMES BEFORE HITTING CELLULAR GOLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was a bleak February night and struggling inventor Scott McGregor was 
losing faith. 
</P>
<P>
 The rent was owing, investors were nowhere to be found and food was running 
low. 
</P>
<P>
 So he gathered his family of nine together and asked the big question. Should 
he get a job, any job, to keep them off welfare? Or should he pursue his dream 
of hitting it big with a cellular phone innovation? 
</P>
<P>
 "Keep going," they said. 
</P>
<P>
 That night four years ago was the turning point in McGregor's dramatic journey 
from poverty to prosperity, a story of how to succeed in business -- by trying, 
trying and trying again. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really a great all-American story," says Lowell M. Snowe, a Salt Lake 
City attorney and lifelong friend of McGregor's. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, as head of Telemac, a cellular telecommunications firm with about two 
dozen employees and offices in Venezuela, Colombia and Ecuador, McGregor, 50, 
can smile as he looks back. He can even laugh, albeit ruefully, about the day 
he drove across town to make sure no one he knew saw him buying groceries with 
food stamps. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been down and out. I've been up and down. I've been everything," he 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 From the beginning, it was clear the Utah-born McGregor's path to success 
would be rough. The night he decided to start his own company, he and his wife 
were involved in a serious auto crash. 
</P>
<P>
 Once recovered, they moved to California. With a partner, McGregor started a 
cellular rental firm in 1987. Two years later, he was broke, victim of a soured 
merger. 
</P>
<P>
 He decided to start over, this time with a new idea. 
</P>
<P>
 During his days in the rental business, he discovered that one of the 
industry's biggest problems was an inability to get instant readouts of calls 
made on rented phones. Companies would bill for total minutes used, but 
couldn't provide a breakdown until the information was processed through a 
central office, long after the rental customer was gone. The result was unhappy 
customers who often challenged their bills. 
</P>
<P>
 McGregor had an idea the right combination of clock, phone and computer could 
fix that problem. He thought his computer whiz kid, Greg, was just the person 
to build the system. 
</P>
<P>
 So, starting in October, 1989, he began working 18-hour days, trying to 
attract investors. 
</P>
<P>
 "The two things that really saved our bacon is AT&T never cut off our long 
distance and Chevron never canceled our Chevron card," he said. When they ran 
out of money, the family bought food off the snack racks at the gas station. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was scary. It was not a nutritious time," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In mid-February came the family conference and the decision to press on. 
</P>
<P>
 Friends and family said they never gave up on McGregor. 
</P>
<P>
 Snowe, now a member of Telemac's board of directors, remembers telling 
McGregor "he'd make it if he really wanted to, if he'd hang on." 
</P>
<P>
 Roberto Fuenzalida, a friend and mechanic who kept the McGregors' vehicles 
running on account, was another believer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even when he was down, he still (would) laugh and say, 'No, I'm coming out of 
this,' " he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The worst stretch lasted about five months, including a two-week stint on food 
stamps in March, 1990, when the Chevron card was finally canceled. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt like such a failure because I could not pull it together," McGregor 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Then came a Sunday night when the McGregors' wobbly finances were about to 
fall flat. They had a notice to vacate their rented house by morning and the 
utilities were to be shut off. 
</P>
<P>
 At 11 p.m., an investor came through. 
</P>
<P>
 "It sounds like literary license, but it was actually, legitimately the 
truth," McGregor said. "Luckily, they wired the money the way they said they 
would, so the checks got paid and away we started." 
</P>
<P>
 At first, McGregor concentrated on renting phones as Greg, then a student at 
the University of California at Davis, kept working on the tracking gadget, 
eventually known as TRAC, or Telemac Rental Accounting Cellular system. 
</P>
<P>
 In May, 1991, disaster struck -- again. 
</P>
<P>
 An investor's check for $50,000 bounced, leaving the McGregors $37,000 in the 
red. A frantic McGregor used up all his frequent-flier miles to meet with the 
investor. He got a letter of regret, but no money. 
</P>
<P>
 McGregor remembers walking out of the office in a daze. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were out of business. We were over with. We were dead," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Distraught, he called a friend who suggested asking customers to invest. He 
only had one customer, Bell South of Atlanta, so he called them. Surprisingly, 
they not only were willing to help him, they had heard about TRAC and asked for 
a demonstration. 
</P>
<P>
 "I said, 'You bet,' " McGregor said. 
</P>
<P>
 Only one problem -- the system wasn't ready. In fact, McGregor had not seen it 
at all. But Greg McGregor built it in between studying for finals while 
McGregor begged and borrowed two plane tickets for the trip to Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't but a few days later that we had a $55,000 check from Bell South 
and that started us over," he said. "We've never really looked back since." 
</P>
<P>
 Today, TRAC, a patented system, is used by several companies, including 
American Cellular Rental, based in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was the TRAC system that was the clincher for us to even start a business, 
because without the detailed billing capability it's just very hard to even 
market our service," said marketing director Gina Jay. 
</P>
<P>
 And Telemac has a second innovation, a system called TAPS, Telemac Automated 
Programming System. TAPS programs cellular phones before they go on store 
shelves, cutting the ready-to-use time from hours to minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Telemac, which has about two dozen employees, is a family affair. 
</P>
<P>
 Wife Diane is chief operating officer, Greg is vice president in charge of 
engineering, twin sons Chris and Travis are in charge of software and hardware, 
respectively, and daughter Caroline is director of operations. The three 
younger children, Sally, Tim and Jill sometimes work part-time. 
</P>
<P>
 The family recently took a diving trip to celebrate their success, and 
McGregor is expanding his suite of offices in a business park in Danville, 
about 30 miles east of San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 But there haven't been many splurges, partly because of the memory of the lean 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 "People love our products and I'm so proud of them I feel good about that," he 
said, "but every single day of my life I'm scared to death."

 NEW FINAL LOOK: When Richard Nixon returned to San Clemente after his Aug. 9, 
1974, resignation, one White House aide to join him was Frank Gannon, who 
helped Nixon prepare his "RN" memoirs. Gannon has since produced a video series 
on the Nixon White House. Included: "Final 28 Days of the Presidency". . . . On 
Monday, the eve of the resignation's 20th anniversary, Gannon will show the 
video and discuss those last days, at the Richard Nixon Library & Birthplace in 
Yorba Linda.

 HAPPY HAUNT: In a family discussion about Disneyland's best attractions, 
someone's favorite is almost always the Haunted Mansion. If you're at 
Disneyland Tuesday, you'll be there for its 25th anniversary. It's an 
antebellum Southern edifice filled with 999 illusionary ghosts -- one even 
hitchhikes onto your "doom" buggy as you ride out. . . . There's a ceremony at 
10 a.m. that day to celebrate. And if you can stand it, they're calling it a 
"Re dead ication. ." 
</P>
<P>
 HAPPY ENDINGS: When struggling to become a sports agent back in the 1980s, 
Newport Beach attorney Jeffrey S. Moorad (E1) was delighted to discover that 
Lucy Semeniuk, another lawyer at the firm where he worked, had dated 
super-agent Leigh Steinberg back during college. . . . Moorad asked her for an 
introduction, and it worked -- spectacularly. Now Moorad is Steinberg's partner 
. . . and now Semeniuk is Steinberg's wife.

 PERSONAL DANGER: This may not grab your attention when you see the new 
Harrison Ford thriller, "Clear and Present Danger," but key to the plot: 
There's hot information placed in a Tapestry Running Mate edition of the Day 
Runner personal organizer. The people who care most, of course, are those at 
Day Runner, based in Fullerton. They were so pleased, they sent personal 
organizers to members of the movie's production staff. The movie is now playing 
at 30 screens in Orange County.

HUNTINGTON TEEN'S HUNGER TO HELP LEADS HIM TO AFRICA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TAMMY HYUNJOO KRESTA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Peter Greyshock is like any other 15-year-old. Well, almost. 
</P>
<P>
 He hangs out with friends, wears baggy pants and reveals a mouthful of braces 
when he grins. Among sports and Led Zeppelin posters on his bedroom walls, 
however, looms a giant poster of John F. Kennedy -- and photographs of an 
African village. 
</P>
<P>
 The Huntington Beach teen is one of three students to have been chosen 
nationwide to participate in a 12-day study tour in Mozambique, where he will 
learn about life in poverty-stricken countries by talking to African youths, 
visiting former civil war refugees and even picking fruit off cassava bushes. 
</P>
<P>
 Peter, who leaves Wednesday for the tour, beat out more than 200 others who 
entered a competition sponsored by World Vision, an international Christian 
agency that provides hunger relief to people in Third World countries. 
</P>
<P>
 After participating in a 30-hour fast, or mock famine, at his church in March, 
Peter wrote a winning essay to World Vision describing his experiences. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd never gone that long without food in my life," said Peter, who is used to 
eating every few hours between surfing and boogie-boarding sessions with 
friends. 
</P>
<P>
 Peter and the other winners, two girls from North Carolina and Minnesota, will 
visit people who are accustomed to hunger. 
</P>
<P>
 The most important thing he will take with him is an open mind, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not expecting anything because whatever I expect it to be, it won't be 
like that," he said in his comfortable home, where he lives with his mother, 
Connie, and brother, Steven, 13. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "We live behind an Orange (County) curtain," Peter said, leaning against a 
wall plastered with magazine cutouts of professional basketball and volleyball 
players. "We're shielded a lot from what goes on in the world." 
</P>
<P>
 But according to his mom, neither of her sons has been shielded from harsh 
realities. 
</P>
<P>
 The boys' father died six years ago when Peter was 9. He grew up quickly and 
became "amazingly mature" for his age, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Peter is a rock," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, he gave up his dream of playing college volleyball when he was 
found to have an arthritic condition in his legs that ruled out any future in a 
contact sport. He swims every day at a local athletic club instead. 
</P>
<P>
 Peter likes to recall what his hero, President Kennedy, once said: "It's time 
for a new generation of leadership. . . . For there is a new world to be won." 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes (teen-agers) get a really bad rap," Peter said, adding that adults 
wrongly perceive teens as being a self-centered, partying bunch. "They are very 
concerned about what goes on in the world." 
</P>
<P>
 If Kennedy were alive, he would be "in touch with my generation," which is why 
Peter admires the former President. 
</P>
<P>
 Peter sees himself as an advocate of young people's rights, he said in a 
conversation peppered with the "uhs" and "likes" of a typical Southern 
California teen-ager. 
</P>
<P>
 His interests are not unusual, he said. Given the opportunity, he insisted, 
many teens would like to go to Mozambique. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 After high school, Peter plans to attend a university in California and study 
law or social services. He will use his education, he said, to champion causes 
of the less fortunate. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he is open to learning from his African experience, Peter knows that 
his 30-hour hunger was fleeting and that he always had an escape if he wanted. 
</P>
<P>
 In his essay, he wrote: 
</P>
<P>
 "I know I cannot even begin to fathom what it feels like to go without food 
for days on end but now that I have somewhat of a realization of what it feels 
like, I know that I have no choice other than to do something about it."

DOCTORS SEEK TO PLUG GAPS IN CARE FOR POOR; HEALTH: LATINO PHYSICIANS AND 
HOSPITAL FILL NEED WITH FIRST OF EIGHT CLINICS FOR LOW-INCOME PEOPLE WHO OFTEN 
SEEK BASIC AID AT EMERGENCY ROOMS, HOLE-IN-THE-WALL CLINICS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Maria Aurora has spent countless hours in emergency rooms, waiting for 
treatment for chronic diabetes and struggling to communicate with doctors who 
don't speak Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, 65-year-old Aurora sat instead at the Alto Care Medical Group, a 
new, no-frills clinic in Orange that is close to her home and is the first of 
eight comprehensive-care centers in the county planned by a coalition of 30 
Latino doctors. 
</P>
<P>
 The network of physicians is affiliated with St. Joseph Hospital and is large 
enough to compete for managed-care contracts -- a must to survive in the age of 
health reform. The doctors say they are intent on bringing bilingual, 
culturally sensitive care with expanded hours to the county's low-income 
Latinos, often alienated by the medical system or victimized at 
hole-in-the-wall clinics. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to give back to the community. That is one of the main things that 
this is about," said Antonio Alarcon, a urologist who practices in Santa Ana 
and Monterey Park and is a founding member of the coalition. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The group's goal is to provide a wide range of services, including urgent 
care, X-rays, laboratory and pharmacy services, referrals to specialists within 
the network and hospital care by the same doctors. The Orange clinic recently 
expanded hours and is open most weekdays from 8:30 a.m. to 9 p.m. and is 
planning to expand weekend hours. 
</P>
<P>
 "This will be a very important service," Aurora said, as she sat flipping a 
magazine in the waiting room on a recent afternoon. "Sometimes people just 
can't make it earlier in the day because they work. Then you end up in an 
emergency room, and sometimes they won't even see you. Last time, I waited and 
waited until I finally left." 
</P>
<P>
 The network, incorporated as the California Hispanic Medical Group, recently 
began advertising in Spanish-language newspapers and is poised to sign a deal 
on a 300,000-square-foot building in Santa Ana that will serve as their second 
medical facility and administrative hub, said Dr. Fernando Montelongo, a 
founding member. 
</P>
<P>
 There are plans for two clinics for Santa Ana and one each in Anaheim, Garden 
Grove, Huntington Beach, Fountain Valley and South County. Montelongo said he 
hoped the first Santa Ana clinic would open by next summer. The sites of the 
other six clinics are still undetermined. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Montelongo recently closed his own offices to launch the Orange clinic on La 
Veta Avenue, and he said other doctors on the group's roster will gradually 
phase out their practices and move into the new clinics. 
</P>
<P>
 All the members were trained and completed their residencies in the United 
States and are on staff at local hospitals. Montelongo said 90% are board 
certified. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are about raising the level of care in the community, and at the same time 
putting something back," Montelongo said recently at the Orange clinic. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our mission is also to get involved in scholarships, voter registration and 
scholastic achievement." 
</P>
<P>
 To that end, the doctors recently donated time and money to the 
"KinderCaminata," a walkathon for kindergarten students organized by Los Amigos 
of Orange County and held at Rancho Santiago College to present inspirational 
role models to youngsters. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have nothing but the utmost respect for them," said Amin David, chairman 
of Los Amigos, a coalition that works to raise awareness about issues affecting 
the Latino community. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not only did they come through with some bucks that we needed, they were 
there in a booth and they put on their best doctors' uniforms. The little kids 
could see, 'Hey, there they are. You can aspire to be a doctor.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Msgr. Jaime Soto, the vicar for the Diocese of Orange's Latino community, 
attended the Orange clinic's opening ceremony in June, along with a host of 
Latino business leaders, and praised the doctors' efforts to unite. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Latinos have always had an instinct that for our own health and well-being 
it's better to come together than to be apart. Whenever someone is sick, family 
comes together, and people come over," he said. "The fact that the doctors in 
the medical community would come together with that same instinct is a hopeful 
sign for me." 
</P>
<P>
 While hospitals across Southern California are looking for ways to tap into 
the Latino market by teaming up with community clinics, Montelongo said his 
group has the commitment to accomplish its vision because most members have 
been serving Latino patients in Orange County for years. 
</P>
<P>
 The group first approached St. Joseph Hospital last November, and the scope of 
their vision impressed hospital administrators. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're very committed, they have a lot of energy, and they have some pretty 
broad goals. It's not just medicine -- they are really trying to hit some of 
the social areas too," said Lisa Hudson, director of business development for 
the hospital. "I think it's pretty ambitious to get up to 30 and 40 physicians 
together. We just hadn't seen that done in the county." 
</P>
<P>
 The physicians who are joining the network are "some of the core physicians 
who have been in the county for a very long time," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea for the group was born two years ago, when Robert Beltran and Roy 
Martinez began to ponder their predicament as doctors increasingly squeezed by 
burgeoning health maintenance organizations (HMOs). 
</P>
<P>
 The physicians, both practicing in Santa Ana at the time, were losing longtime 
patients as employers shepherded them into the HMOs, said Beltran, who spent 10 
years practicing in Santa Ana and now has offices in Irvine and Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted to be an entity with an edge," Beltran said. "That's where the idea 
came from to group together as many of the Hispanic physicians as we possibly 
could, with a window of opportunity existing within the Hispanic marketplace." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 While the group is particularly poised to serve Latino patients, the doctors 
stressed that they are open to all, and chose a generic name -- "Alto Care 
Medical Group" -- so they would not alienate other patients. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Orange clinic recently, patients said a network of services with late 
hours would save them the high costs and long waits of emergency rooms. 
</P>
<P>
 When 2-year-old Joseph Gomez was seized on a recent evening with the chronic 
bronchitis that has plagued him since infancy, his parents rushed him to the 
Santa Ana clinic they know best.  
</P>
<P>
 But the clinic closes at 5 p.m., and the Anaheim family had no choice but to 
head for a nearby emergency room, said Nidia Gomez, 34, the boy's mother. 
</P>
<P>
 "The schedule they have here is an excellent schedule," Gomez said as Joseph 
looked through a children's book and played with the drinking fountain in the 
pastel-toned waiting room. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many times, people get sick suddenly in the evening and there is nowhere to 
go but the emergency room. I can only hope that there will be more programs 
like this, for the whole community, Anglo as well as Latino."

REVISITING THEIR ROOTS; NATIVE AMERICANS FROM ACROSS U.S. GATHER FOR THREE-DAY 
POWWOW OF CULTURES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Five-year-old Christopher Jackson stomped his hide-covered feet and circled a 
dusty arena to the constant beating of drums and chants. Wiping the sweat off 
his chubby face afterward, he shyly counted to 10 in Navajo to the request of 
passersby. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher, who wore a miniature war-dance outfit with feather bustles and a 
beaded gown, was among the most popular photo subjects at the 26th Annual 
Powwow at the Orange County Fairgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
 He politely posed for flashing cameras and whirring camcorders handled by city 
slickers. Many of them had never seen traditional Native American dances 
before. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Keevim Lewis, a spokesman for the Southern California Indian 
Center, the powwow is the largest exhibition of Native American arts, crafts, 
food and traditional dancing in California. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 20,000 people are expected to attend the three-day event, which the 
center began in 1968 so that people of Native American descent could "share 
traditional dances and songs handed down from generations," Lewis said. 
</P>
<P>
 Native Americans from Orange County to Minnesota exhibited jewelry, wooden 
flutes, moccasins and even deer and raccoon hides in booths throughout the 
fairgrounds. Food vendors sold Indian fry bread, a puffy flour roll dipped in 
boiling oil and topped with beans, lettuce and tomatoes. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher's mom, Lorraine, said the powwow allowed her son to "keep in touch 
with his roots." It was at a similar gathering earlier this year in Arizona 
that Christopher decided that he wanted to dance too, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lorraine Jackson, 26, and her husband, Danny, 28, didn't join their son in the 
arena Saturday, but they did offer their wares. 
</P>
<P>
 They sold turquoise jewelry and dream catchers, which are purported in Native 
American legend to catch and destroy bad dreams in a webbed ring that usually 
hangs near a window, said Jackson, who is Apache. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher, who lives on a Navajo reservation in Arizona with his parents, 
danced in the scorching heat Saturday along with dozens of others wearing 
bright traditional clothes. 
</P>
<P>
 Men, women and children competed since Friday for cash prizes that will be 
awarded to the winners in each category of the dancing competition today, Lewis 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 And despite growing fears that the younger generation of Native Americans are 
losing touch with their culture, many young dancers, like Christopher and 
11-year-old Jin Alice, were very much aware of their roots. 
</P>
<P>
 Jin of Orange danced alongside her mother, brothers and sister. She wore a 
beaded white deer skin dress and cooled herself with a fan made of mock eagle 
feathers. 
</P>
<P>
 She is from the Comanche Wichita and Choctaw tribes, she said, and "I've been 
dancing since I've been walking." 
</P>
<P>
 The powwow continues today from 9 a.m. to 7:30 p.m. Admission is $5 for 
adults, $3 for teens and senior citizens, $1 for children under 12 years and 
free for children under 5. Donations are being taken at the gate. 
</P>
<P>
 The Southern California Indian Center distributes food and other items and 
services to needy Native Americans throughout Southern California.

CITYWALK TIGHTENING SECURITY IN WAKE OF MELEE; TOURISM: DEPUTIES USED PEPPER 
SPRAY FRIDAY TO BREAK UP A FIGHT. POLICE SAY NO PASSERSBY WERE ENDANGERED, BUT 
FANTASY STREETSCAPE'S OPERATORS SAY THEY WILL NOT TOLERATE DISTURBANCES. 
</P>

<P>
 It was built to create a safe and highly stylized version of a Los Angeles 
block, with upscale restaurants and shops. 
</P>
<P>
 But real-life violence erupted Friday night at the $100-million fantasy 
streetscape in Universal City known as CityWalk. Sheriff's deputies used pepper 
spray to break up a melee between alleged gang members who fought each other 
with fists and chairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said they are increasing security at the year-old tourist 
attraction that was engineered and built by entertainment giant MCA. The 
company had already toughened its rules for visitors after several fights last 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
 CityWalk officials said Saturday that they intend to keep a tight rein on the 
simulated street. 
</P>
<P>
 "We aren't going to stand for any kind of disturbance at CityWalk whatsoever," 
said Joan Bullard, a spokeswoman for Universal Studios Hollywood, which 
operates the attraction. "We'll do whatever it takes." 
</P>
<P>
 The fight and eight arrests Friday night never endangered passersby, said Sgt. 
Michael Parker, who described it as "an isolated incident." 
</P>
<P>
 The trouble began when three of the men started to hit and kick another man. A 
deputy standing less than 100 yards away called for backup assistance and then 
ran over to stop the fight. 
</P>
<P>
 But as deputies were preparing to take away the four men, four others -- said 
to be friends of the victim -- began to attack their rivals with chairs. None 
of the deputies were targeted by the chairs, but they had to use pepper spray 
to break up the fight. 
</P>
<P>
 No one was injured in the incident and none of the suspects were carrying 
weapons, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Six men were arrested on suspicion of assault with a deadly weapon. They were 
identified as Charvel Hamilton, Ryan Monte, and Dereck Washington, all 18; 
Theodore Montgomery, 19; Damien Roe, 20, and Timothy Clem, 21. 
</P>
<P>
 A juvenile, 15, was arrested for investigation of assault with a deadly 
weapon, and a 17-year-old was arrested on suspicion of misdemeanor battery. All 
but the 17-year-old were in custody Saturday, Parker said. All eight are from 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 2 million visitors have come to Universal's CityWalk since it opened 
to great fanfare a year ago. Some criticized the attraction, saying it tried 
too hard to be an idealized vision of Los Angeles, an elitist enclave without 
any of the city's urban troubles. 
</P>
<P>
 Last fall, MCA and its private security guards began enforcing a strict code 
of conduct -- forbidding visitors, for example, to cuss or wear baseball caps 
backward -- to reverse a growing fear that gang members had discovered the 
promenade. 
</P>
<P>
 Last August, a fight between gang members and members of the Los Angeles 
Valley College football team sent visitors fleeing for cover, sheriff's reports 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 In September, members of two gangs fought over a girlfriend in front of 
Wolfgang Puck's restaurant at CityWalk, according to sheriff's reports. There 
were no arrests.  
</P>
<P>
 Later that month, an 18-year-old Los Angeles man was stabbed in one of the 
theaters adjacent to CityWalk. His attackers fled before sheriff's deputies 
arrived.

OUTDOOR TANNING RISKS; MANY BEACH-GOERS GO UV UNCONSCIOUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLA HALL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 From your prone perspective on a towel spread across the sand of Santa Monica 
Beach, you know it's about 70 degrees, there's a mild breeze, the sky is 
virtually cloudless, the sun is blissfully hot . . . But wait! Do you know what 
the UV index number is today? Do you even know what the UV index is? 
</P>
<P>
 Bikini-clad Janice Stavile peers up from her towel, shading her eyes with her 
hand. "Yeah -- ultraviolet index," she nods, promptly ignoring it as she 
returns to suntanning. 
</P>
<P>
 A little way down the beach, Paul Kim, 24, hunkers down with a thick novel to 
spend the next two hours working on burnishing his already bronzed body. "I can 
assume what it is -- the day's index of ultraviolet rays indicating the dangers 
of skin cancer," he says. "You've probably heard this a million times," says 
Kim, who is of Korean descent, "but with my pigment, I just suck in the sun. 
I've never gotten sunburned." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 And so went the litany from unrepentant suntanners Saturday at high noon -- 
the most dangerous time for rays. Little more than a month after the much 
heralded arrival of the ultraviolet index in weather forecasts, the 
sun-consuming public is underwhelmed . . . though not uninformed. They all know 
that exposure to the sun potentially causes wrinkles and skin cancer. Either 
they're doing something about it -- without prompting from the UV index -- or 
their attitude is: been there, heard that, don't care. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just came to the beach for peace and rest and we didn't think about the 
sun rays," says Stavile, 31, who fits the fair-skinned prototype on which the 
index is based. "As you can see, we're pretty white," she says, laughing and 
looking at her friend, Jon Troop, stretched out on the towel next to her. "When 
I have a tan, I feel healthy. That's why I lie in the sun. If the sun doesn't 
get me, something else will." 
</P>
<P>
 The index these people have chosen to ignore was a painstakingly conceived 
project of the National Weather Service and the Environmental Protection 
Agency. Still in the experimental phase in 58 cities, the index interprets the 
ultraviolet radiation level (from 0 to 15) in terms of the number of minutes it 
would take a so-called average fair-skinned person to burn. (Although sometimes 
the index is gauged for "least sensitive" and "most sensitive" skin types.) On 
Saturday, a Level 8 day, a fair-skinned person would burn -- actually begin to 
redden -- in 10 minutes.  
</P>
<P>
 In fact, if this were a perfect sun-blocking world, people would not use the 
index as a recipe for baking themselves but as a warning to always wear 
protective lotion, sun hats, sunglasses and avoid the sun in general during the 
peak hours around noon. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to protect not just against skin burn but cancer, cataracts and 
immune suppression, and those latter effects are no respecter of skin color," 
says Drusilla Hufford, a branch chief at the EPA who helped develop the index. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But it's an uphill battle. They tried to make the index user-friendly: "We did 
some focus groups," says Nina Oligino, from the Washington-based Partners for 
Sun Protection Awareness, a coalition of health groups, "and time and time 
again people said, 'Keep it simple.' " 
</P>
<P>
 But the Saturday index was a graph of UV level versus "minutes to burn" 
plotted for two skin types. Stick that index in people's faces and they look at 
it like it's a math problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Monica lifeguard Trec Shadid, 36, has a sober assessment of the beach 
population's UV consciousness. "They're not," Shadid says bluntly. "No 
sunscreen, no T-shirts." 
</P>
<P>
 Shadid wears both a T-shirt and sun block with an SPF (sun protection factor) 
of 30-45. "I don't check the UV index," he says, "but I'm fully aware that the 
UVA and UVB levels have increased with the depletion of the ozone layer over 
Antarctica." 
</P>
<P>
 Others were somewhat dutiful -- Belinda Noriega, 13, had heard a televised 
report Friday night forecasting a high UV level. So she packed her No. 23 sun 
block, but she still had the bottle tucked away while she sat on the beach. "I 
didn't want my hands full of that grease," she says of the oily lotion , as she 
nibbles at a take-out breakfast of eggs and sausage. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Some took precautions that started long before the UV index. Annie Kakoussian 
of Pasadena had slathered on a 30 SPF sun block, having become a believer 
"after I hit 30." She's 36. "The skin cancer -- plus aging. You age faster." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, some youthful tanners (who ironically get the most sun and 
therefore suffer the most damage) are lost causes. "We're too young to worry 
about those things," said Fabiola Leal, 20, coating herself with Hawaiian 
Tropic Dark Tan Lotion No. 4. "We just come to get a tan." 
</P>
<P>
 But one of the most cavalier sun worshipers was Dorothy Goff, a 71-year-old La 
Crescenta woman who takes a bus three times a week to the beach. Goff, a 
part-time waitress, smokes two packs of cigarettes a day, swims, dives and 
tans. "I don't burn," says the blue-eyed, light-haired woman. Her fair-skinned 
face is lined -- the sign of 71 years of life as well as sun, no doubt. "I've 
heard them say, 'Stay out of the sun.' The more they say it, the more I go in," 
Goff says. "I've buried two kids and one husband. I live one day at a time."

ARIZONANS ANGERED BY STORAGE OF TAINTED SOIL; WASTE: DDT-CONTAMINATED DIRT IS 
BEING SHIPPED TO PHOENIX FACILITY. BUT SOME OFFICIALS ARE DEMANDING THAT IT BE 
SENT BACK TO CALIFORNIA IMMEDIATELY. 
</P>

<P>
 The same DDT-tainted dirt that sparked an angry furor in a South Bay 
neighborhood this summer is provoking public outcry in Phoenix, where residents 
are protesting the fact that California's waste is being stored in their city. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 1,000 tons of contaminated soil dug from behind two homes near 
Torrance are being shipped to a Phoenix hazardous waste facility for temporary 
storage and testing. 
</P>
<P>
 The dirt's arrival is creating a tempest among Arizona politicians and 
environmentalists, and some are insisting that the shipment be returned to 
California immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 "We love their tired, their poor, their earthquake-tossed folks, but we don't 
want their hazardous waste, thank you very much," said Raena Honan, legislative 
director for the Sierra Club's Arizona chapter. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'Orphan' toxic waste being stored in S. Phoenix," trumpeted a banner 
headline Thursday in the Arizona Republic. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Phoenix and Arizona officials are taking steps to ensure that the bins of 
dirt do not linger in the storage yard of Greenfield Environmental, a waste 
firm in southern Phoenix, where they are being transported from another firm in 
Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Arizona Gov. Fife Symington has asked the Arizona Department of Environmental 
Quality to have the waste removed within 30 days. The agency last month had 
issued a permit allowing the dirt to be stored at Greenfield Environmental for 
up to 90 days. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Phoenix officials have notified the owners of Greenfield 
Environmental that the presence of the soil is a zoning violation and must be 
removed within seven days. 
</P>
<P>
 As of Friday, government officials in the two states were hurriedly phoning 
one another in search of a compromise, but no one could say where -- or when -- 
the controversy-plagued soil will travel next. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to make sure that people's concerns are heard and responded to," said 
John Lyons, assistant regional counsel for the U.S. Environmental Protection 
Agency, which excavated the soil from two yards near Torrance this spring and 
is overseeing its transport to Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're working with (Arizona) to resolve the issue," said Virginia Donohue, 
spokeswoman for the EPA regional office in San Francisco. "This is interim 
storage; it was never intended for long-term storage there." 
</P>
<P>
 The Arizona debate is the latest turn of events in an environmental drama that 
began this spring when an EPA cleanup unearthed chunks of DDT, some as large as 
bowling balls, mixed with fill soil behind two homes on West 204th Street in an 
unincorporated area east of Torrance.  
</P>
<P>
 The federal government has relocated 33 families for the rest of the year 
while it studies the extent of the contamination. DDT, banned for most uses in 
1972, is a suspected human carcinogen that can affect the nervous system. 
</P>
<P>
 EPA officials insist that the DDT chunks came from the now demolished Montrose 
Chemical Corp. factory in the Harbor Gateway area of Los Angeles, where the 
pesticide was produced from 1947 to 1982. The factory, on the federal Superfund 
list of the nation's 1,200 most hazardous toxic sites, is three-tenths of a 
mile from the back yards where the DDT was found. 
</P>
<P>
 The EPA on June 21 ordered the Montrose Chemical Corp. to dispose of the soil, 
which officials describe as so toxic that it must be incinerated at an 
estimated cost of $2 million or more. Such incineration cannot be done in 
either California or Arizona because neither state has a permitted hazardous 
waste incinerator, said the EPA's Lyons. 
</P>
<P>
 Montrose officials have maintained that the government has no firm proof the 
DDT is theirs, and the tainted soil sat in a Long Beach storage yard while 
attorneys debated its fate. Late last month, the EPA and the former pesticide 
manufacturer struck a compromise to allow the soil to be shipped to Arizona 
temporarily so that Montrose could test it further. 
</P>
<P>
 Only 38 of the 67 bins have arrived so far at the Phoenix site, said David 
Merk, vice president of Greenfield Environmental. He said the soil is safely 
sealed in heavy metal containers. 
</P>
<P>
 But that is not good enough for some Phoenix residents, who are criticizing 
the state Department of Environmental Quality for issuing a permit without what 
they call adequate notice. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our problem is, why is an emergency in California all of a sudden in 
Arizona?" asked Scott Meyer, vice president of Don't Waste Arizona Inc., an 
environmental group.

BILL BOYARSKY: THE SPIN; WHY CAN'T TV COVER POLITICS THE WAY IT DOES SIMPSON? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BOYARSKY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 We all know the impact of television on the criminal justice system, but I got 
a fresh insight the other day in a bare room on the 12th floor of the Criminal 
Courts Building. 
</P>
<P>
 News executives and technical people from L.A. television stations, CNN and 
Court TV were meeting to go over plans for the building's new electronic 
pressroom, which may cost the stations as much as $250,000. It's not just for 
the O.J. Simpson trial, which is scheduled to begin Sept. 19, but for all time, 
the group was told. Or at least as long as the creaky building survives. 
</P>
<P>
 As I watched these two dozen or so men and women discuss cables, phone 
connections, picture quality, power sources and monitors, I wondered why the 
stations didn't expend all this attention and money on some other stories I 
have covered recently. 
</P>
<P>
 Specifically, I was thinking about events that will shape our lives much more 
than the Simpson trial. You seldom see television on the campaign for governor 
of California. Nor was the medium present much during last year's campaigning 
for Los Angeles mayor. Yet television is the way most people get their news. 
America's fix on the world, our vision of the Southland, is heavily influenced 
by what we see on TV. 
</P>
<P>
 TV's absence from political campaigns and many other public policy events 
reflects its view of what's hot and what's not. Politics bores local TV. 
Trials, especially Simpson's, are blazing hot. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The importance of the Simpson story was evident at the meeting, organized by 
the Radio Television News Assn., where L.A.'s highly competitive broadcast news 
organizations put aside differences to work on matters of mutual concern. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, there is the issue of parking for TV's big trucks and generators. 
The operator of the parking lot next to the Criminal Courts Building quadrupled 
his rates during the Simpson preliminary hearing, charging $4,600 a day for 80 
spaces, which comes to an individual daily tab of $57.50. 
</P>
<P>
 The RTNA is trying to find cheaper spaces. They're hoping for a better 
location too. During the preliminary, carbon monoxide fumes from the generators 
poured into nearby air conditioning intakes and wafted through the Criminal 
Courts Building. A Cal/OSHA inspector was called to order the generators turned 
off. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite their eagerness, and the high revenues from commercials, some of the 
stations seemed to fit the "slow pay" classification. RTNA President Milli 
Martinez, a KABC-TV executive producer, had to ask the deadbeats to pay up for 
parking and other expenses still owed from the preliminary hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Shulman of KABC-TV outlined the difficulties of wiring the new 
pressroom, which will replace cramped quarters on the floor below where a 
jungle of wires and cables made it difficult to walk. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he wore the casual attire of television technical people -- jeans, 
athletic shoes and sport shirt -- Shulman was pure business. The atmosphere in 
the room reminded me of news executives planning for a national political 
convention. 
</P>
<P>
 Shulman explained how cables will be run through conduits above the ceiling 
and behind the walls, through asbestos, down to the first floor, where there's 
a telephone connection. "One of the great costs is going through the asbestos 
in the building," Shulman said. "We can't leave this system the way it is now," 
he said. "We want it better. 
</P>
<P>
 All the new cables and connections will make it possible to cover more than 
one big trial at a time. That may happen in September. Heidi Fleiss, accused of 
being L.A.'s latest madam to the stars, goes on trial Aug. 27 on charges of 
pandering and selling cocaine. The Simpson and Fleiss trials will probably 
overlap, making the Criminal Courts Building the sensation capital of the 
country, if not the world. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our goal was to have it done by Heidi Fleiss," said President Martinez, "but 
that's impossible." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The fact that local TV is spending up to a quarter of a million dollars for a 
Criminal Courts Building pressroom emphasizes its place as a permanent presence 
in our criminal justice system. Court TV, with its pioneering live trial 
programming, showed the stations what they should have known in the first 
place: Trials are made for television, just as they have been for the stage and 
films. 
</P>
<P>
 We've seen the results in recent televised trials. Judges, prosecutors and 
defense attorneys have been transformed into celebrities, as have jurors. This 
new force may be affecting the outcome of cases, although at this early stage 
nobody is quite sure how. What we do know is that the criminal justice system 
is such a powerful force that any change in it affects many lives. 
</P>
<P>
 The media have the obligation of educating the public about what's happening. 
Once the Simpson trial is completed, I wonder if local television will stay on 
the job in its high-tech new pressroom -- even when there are no hot trials.

8 ARRESTED IN BRAWL AT UNIVERSAL CITYWALK; VIOLENCE: DEPUTIES USE PEPPER SPRAY 
TO BREAK UP FRACAS BETWEEN GANG MEMBERS AS URBAN TENSIONS ENCROACH ON IDYLLIC 
MALL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Real-life violence erupted at the $100-million fantasy streetscape known as 
CityWalk, where sheriff's deputies used pepper spray to break up a melee 
between rival gang members who fought each other with fists and chairs Friday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities plan to increase security at the year-old tourist attraction that 
was engineered and built by entertainment giant MCA Inc. to create a safe and 
highly stylized version of a Los Angeles street. CityWalk officials had already 
toughened their rules for visitors after several clashes last summer. 
</P>
<P>
 In a brief battle that escalated from fist fighting to chair throwing, several 
deputies had to subdue six men and two juveniles who met by chance at about 
11:30 p.m. Friday, said Sheriff's Sgt. Michael Parker. 
</P>
<P>
 All eight, who are from Los Angeles, were arrested on charges ranging from 
misdemeanor battery to assault with a deadly weapon, Parker said.  
</P>
<P>
 The fight and arrests did not endanger visitors to the collection of upscale 
restaurants and shops, said Parker, who described it as "an isolated incident." 
</P>
<P>
 More than 2 million visitors have come to CityWalk since it opened to great 
fanfare in May, 1993. Some criticized the attraction, saying it tried too hard 
to be an idealized vision of Los Angeles, an elitist enclave with none of the 
city's troubles. 
</P>
<P>
 Last fall, MCA and its security guards began enforcing a strict code of 
conduct -- forbidding visitors, for example, from swearing or wearing baseball 
caps backward -- to reverse the growing fear that gang members had discovered 
the promenade. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials with the attraction said Saturday they intend to keep a tight rein 
on their simulated street. 
</P>
<P>
 "We aren't going to stand for any kind of disturbance at CityWalk whatsoever," 
said Joan Bullard, a spokeswoman for Universal Studios Hollywood, which 
operates the attraction. "We'll do whatever it takes." 
</P>
<P>
 The trouble Friday started when three men started to hit and kick another man. 
A sheriff's deputy standing less than 100 yards away called for backup 
assistance and ran over to stop the fight. 
</P>
<P>
 As deputies were preparing to take the four men away, four others, said to be 
friends of the victim, began to attack their rivals with chairs. None of the 
deputies were targeted by the chairs, but they used pepper spray to break up 
the fracas. 
</P>
<P>
 Officers from the North Hollywood station of the Los Angeles Police Department 
were also called. CityWalk is located in an unincorporated portion of Los 
Angeles County and is policed by a sheriff's substation as well as a private 
security force and the LAPD. 
</P>
<P>
 No one was injured in the fight and none of the suspects were carrying 
weapons, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The six men were arrested for assault with a deadly weapon. They were 
identified as Charvel Hamilton, Ryan Monte and Dereck Washington, all 18; and 
Theodore Montgomery, 19, Damien Roe, 20, and Timothy Clem, 21. 
</P>
<P>
 A 15-year-old juvenile was arrested for assault with a deadly weapon and a 
17-year-old was arrested for misdemeanor battery. 
</P>
<P>
 All but the 17-year-old were in custody Saturday, Parker said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bullard said the impact of the incident would be negligible. "I don't think 
it's going to affect tourism," the spokeswoman said. "I think the general 
public realizes that Universal CityWalk is a very safe place to dine, shop or 
be a tourist. This is a very rare incident for us." 
</P>
<P>
 But according to Sheriff's Department incident reports from last summer, the 
site has had several violent fights. Since then, the rules have been toughened. 
</P>
<P>
 Sgt. Guy Earl of the sheriff's substation at CityWalk said deputies enforce 
the county's 10 p.m. curfew for minors. "If kids are just hanging out, then 
they have to leave," Earl said. "If they are doing something, like having 
dinner or seeing a movie, then they leave them alone." 
</P>
<P>
 Last August, a fight erupted between gang members and members of the Los 
Angeles Valley College football team. The confrontation sent visitors fleeing 
for cover, sheriff's reports said. 
</P>
<P>
 In September, members of two gangs fought over a girlfriend in front of the 
Wolfgang Puck Cafe at CityWalk, according to sheriff's reports. There were no 
arrests.  
</P>
<P>
 Later that month, an 18-year-old Los Angeles man was stabbed in one of the 
theaters adjacent to CityWalk. The man's attackers fled before sheriff's 
deputies arrived. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, deputies said they feared that the tourist attraction was also 
bringing in gang members. 
</P>
<P>
 "Four or five years ago, gangs used to see Universal as a neutral place, 
someplace you could take your girlfriend or wife," Sheriff's Deputy Jim 
Campbell said last summer. "Now there are confrontations between them. The air 
of neutrality is gone." 
</P>
<P>
 The Sheriff's Department said Saturday that current CityWalk crime statistics 
are unavailable. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Brian Singer, who works at Cafe Puccino, said Saturday: "The 
sheriff's deputies that were in here drinking coffee this morning said this 
kind of stuff happens every weekend."

ON GUARD; SAFETY: YOUNG JUNIOR LIFEGUARD TRAINEES TAKE A DIP IN CASTAIC LAKE TO 
LEARN SKILLS INCLUDING RESCUE TACTICS, CPR AND FIRST AID. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Fifteen-year-old Ryan Hyfield admits he originally joined the Castaic Lake 
Junior Lifeguard Program four years ago mostly to have fun and maybe meet some 
cute girls. 
</P>
<P>
 But since then, Ryan said he has learned that "being a lifeguard is a good way 
to help people." 
</P>
<P>
 The junior guard program, sponsored by the Los Angeles County Department of 
Parks and Recreation, offers two four-week sessions each summer for youngsters 
ages 9 to 17. 
</P>
<P>
 The program teaches the kids everything they would need to become professional 
lifeguards. Among other things, they learn water-safety skills, rescue tactics 
and boating laws. Participants can also earn cardiopulmonary resuscitation and 
first-aid certificates. 
</P>
<P>
 "Each day the junior lifeguards are expected to be ready to work," but also to 
have fun, said Tracy Hild, senior Castaic Lake lifeguard and program 
coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
 "To me the most important thing about the program is that it makes these kids 
aware of safety," she added. The skills they learn "can be applied wherever 
they are, whether it means having to use CPR on their little brother or sister 
or using first-aid techniques on a complete stranger." 
</P>
<P>
 A typical day of junior guard training at Castaic Lake begins with a morning 
swim or run. The kids are then divided into small groups for instruction 
sessions and practice. Later in the afternoon, some of the youngsters may try 
paddle-boarding or go for a canoe ride. Other activities include jet skiing, 
windsurfing, water-skiing and kayaking. 
</P>
<P>
 Youngsters also take part in a variety of simulated rescues. One recent 
exercise pitted two teams outfitted in masks and snorkels against each other as 
they raced the clock to locate a plastic dummy hidden 35 feet underwater. 
</P>
<P>
 Boating safety is stressed as well. For example, the junior guards learn what 
speed limit to use when passing swimmers and what safety equipment to put 
aboard before launching a vessel into the water. 
</P>
<P>
 The guards also get a chance to compete against other junior guards throughout 
California in events that include paddle-board races and rescue races, 
long-distance swims and run-swim-run races. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this summer, junior lifeguards from Castaic Lake traveled to Santa 
Barbara to compete, where Ryan placed 18th in a run-swim-run race and swam 
1,200 yards.  
</P>
<P>
 Another Castaic team member, 16-year-old Lukas Antos, placed 19th in the 
paddle-board race, and Alex David, 16, placed 10th in the long-distance run. 
</P>
<P>
 "The kids like this program because it's challenging and fun," said Hild. She 
added that, for her, "it's fulfilling to know I'm teaching them to provide a 
safe environment for others."

LETTERS TO LAWMAKERS DON'T ALL BEAR STAMP OF APPROVAL; CONGRESS: CONSTITUENTS 
SEND MOUNTAINS OF MAIL. THE MESSAGES CAN BE BENIGN OR HATEFUL, WACKY OR 
TERRIFYING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Three times a day the squeaky-wheeled metal mail carts trundle along the 
corridors of the House and Senate office buildings, loaded with letters from 
that strange Constituent Land outside the Beltway, missives bearing messages 
benign or hateful, wacky or terrifying. 
</P>
<P>
 Each year, congressmen and senators receive nearly 50 million pieces of mail 
delivered to their Capitol Hill offices -- each sliced open by some overworked 
junior staffer to be read, analyzed or thrown away. 
</P>
<P>
 Many are funny or evocative -- containing pithy zingers, one-liners and 
insults aimed at the politician or his positions. A few even offer legitimate 
suggestions on how to better run the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
 And then there are the long and rambling ones, hate mail filled with racial 
epithets or danger signals. 
</P>
<P>
 Take the one that landed in Rep. Henry A. Waxman's office last year. 
</P>
<P>
 There was something about the feel of the thing, perhaps the scribbled 
handwriting, that separated it from the hundreds of other letters received each 
day by the Democrat who represents an area of the Westside and a part of the 
southern San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was only when staffers read the letter that the red flags were hoisted: 
It included a death threat. 
</P>
<P>
 Waxman aides forwarded the missive to the House sergeant-at-arms, who 
investigates suspicious mail. "They told us not to worry, that they had checked 
the guy out and he wasn't really that dangerous," recalled Waxman 
administrative assistant Phil Schiliro. "They said he had just had one criminal 
charge. So we asked what that was." 
</P>
<P>
 The reply: assault with a deadly weapon. 
</P>
<P>
 "Somehow," Schiliro said, "we didn't rest any easier." 
</P>
<P>
 While Washington lawmakers receive many threats each year, most potshots come 
in a different form. 
</P>
<P>
 "The classic threat from unwell people," observed one staffer, "is not 'I'm 
going to kill you,' but 'I'm going to keep writing you.' " 
</P>
<P>
 And they do, sometimes producing off-the-wall letters that leave congressional 
staffers scratching their heads: like the missives sent from a Minnesota man to 
a San Fernando Valley congressman, which declared that "Trees everywhere need 
trimming and removing" and "It's about time you did something to earn your 
salary. An orgasm of crime is sweeping America." 
</P>
<P>
 Then there are the weird letters that might as well carry a postmark from 
Mars, which force congressional aides to compose the ultimate politically 
correct reply -- one that appears to respond while actually saying nothing at 
all: "Thank you very much for writing us about the Martians pumping air into 
your house. The congressman was most interested . . . "  
</P>
<P>
 Said one staffer: "How do you answer mail from the lunatic fringe? It's an art 
form to fashion rational responses to people who make absolutely no sense 
whatsoever." 
</P>
<P>
 One writer sends his thoughts scribbled on public restroom paper towels that 
are each painstakingly wrapped in old aluminum foil. Another claims the CIA is 
monitoring him through fillings in his teeth. 
</P>
<P>
 There's the constituent who insists the nation's ZIP code system is outdated 
and should be replaced with one based on a person's birthday on the ancient 
Julian calendar. Or the woman who writes Rep. Howard P. (Buck) McKeon as often 
as three times daily -- missives stamped with the image of an upside-down 
American flag that rail about the excesses of big government, that explain why 
Congress and the United Nations should be abolished. 
</P>
<P>
 Examining one letter, McKeon, a Republican who represents the Santa Clarita 
and Antelope valleys, shakes his head: "Imagine having nothing else to do but 
write letters to your congressman." 
</P>
<P>
 Constituent letters represent political lobbying at its purest: Unlike the 
huge, well-oiled tobacco and milk interests, they show the Common Man making 
his point, trying to influence Big Government to his way of thinking. 
</P>
<P>
 Such letters play a role in politics. Some are read on the House or Senate 
floor as examples of what the public really is thinking. Others read them aloud 
on their weekly cable television shows. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's what lobbying is all about," added McKeon. "Over the years, the concept 
of lobbying has taken on negative connotations. But for me, real lobbying is 
what these people do -- write to get your point across." 
</P>
<P>
 Many lawmakers believe one thoughtful personal letter on an overlooked issue 
has more influence than a flood of correspondence on some raging national 
controversy. 
</P>
<P>
 Such letter blitzes are often part of some special interest campaign. On 
Capitol Hill, they are known as Astro-Turf campaigns -- artificial, compared to 
real grass-roots efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 Vera Katz of Santa Monica, a Russian immigrant, penned a letter so personal it 
moved Waxman's staff to lobby a foreign government on her behalf. 
</P>
<P>
 It involved Gilshteyn Fridrikh -- a 54-year-old Muscovite and close friend of 
Katz who she said was imprisoned in Russia for being a Jew who wanted to 
emigrate to Israel. Katz's letter described Fridrikh's broken arms and legs, 
injuries inflicted by his captors, and pleaded with Waxman to investigate. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite several efforts by Waxman's staff to contact Boris Yeltsin and the 
Russian government, there has been no reply. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Katz is thankful. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wrote from the bottom of my heart," said Katz, 50, whose husband teaches 
seismology at USC. "I trust Mr. Waxman. And when you trust somebody, it is easy 
to write them. 
</P>
<P>
 "My friend is dying. He is deaf, and he is starving. Henry Waxman performed 
like he was a friend of poor Gilshteyn. I am disappointed with my government 
but very proud of my American congressman." 
</P>
<P>
 Colleen Buckley of Palmdale wrote her congressman, pleading for his help in 
saving her home, which was up for foreclosure. Her humor despite dire 
circumstances moved McKeon to respond, especially the line that Buckley was 
divorcing a Democrat. 
</P>
<P>
 Buckley sent similar letters to many public officials, including President 
Clinton, whether she had voted for them or not. She got what she called a 
worthless form letter from the office of Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.). 
</P>
<P>
 McKeon called her at home. 
</P>
<P>
 Although McKeon has been unable to save her home from foreclosure Buckley 
thanked him for trying. "Just the fact that he called, has written letters and 
made contacts on my behalf, that has meant so much," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just wanted to tell somebody in government what the heck was happening. 
Nobody listened except Buck. Now I'm going to work on the committee to reelect 
Buck McKeon. Pay-backs aren't always hell." 
</P>
<P>
 Following an unpopular vote, Sen. William Cohen (R-Maine) received a letter 
from another Cohen asking him to "Please change your last name because you are 
a considerable embarrassment to Cohens such as me." Better perhaps than this 
letter Cohen received during the Watergate affair, perhaps from a Nixon fan: 
"May a thousand camels relieve themselves in your drink." 
</P>
<P>
 There's a definite cause and effect to congressional mail. When Waxman becomes 
the subject of a television news report on his battles with lobbyists, his mail 
volume skyrockets -- the letters both laudatory and insulting. 
</P>
<P>
 He has received letters from children thanking him for his anti-smoking 
efforts -- such as the Georgia fifth-grader who praised him because "you . . . 
really kick butt where the tobacco companies are concerned." 
</P>
<P>
 Others have taken Waxman to task on the same issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got one letter from a Kentucky voter saying the congressman should leave 
the tobacco companies alone and put his skills to work on a real issue: people 
who forget to leave up the toilet seat in public restrooms," said legislative 
assistant Russell Shaw. 
</P>
<P>
 Waxman is amazed at the hatred in some letters. "I didn't realize there was so 
much anti-Semitism in this country," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to put it in perspective. I don't think they're a sizable force in 
America. Anyway, the threats don't scare me personally or politically. You 
accept the fact that when you're Jewish and a highly visible public figure, 
people are going to let you know their views on Jews." 
</P>
<P>
 Some politicians have countered such vitriol with a sense of style. 
Congressman Sam Rayburn, the story goes, returned hate mail with an attached 
note: "Some crackpot sent me this letter with your name on it. I thought you 
should know." 
</P>
<P>
 Another answered constituent suggestions by returning the letters marked with 
one of his two rubber stamps: "Hell, yes!" or "Hell, no!" 
</P>
<P>
 One San Fernando Valley lawmaker answered an insulting letter by thanking the 
writer. Then he handwrote at the end of the typed form letter: "Now get a 
life." 
</P>
<P>
 Waxman won't give mail hecklers even the benefit of a return letter, 
"especially if they're out of my district," he quipped. 
</P>
<P>
 Senate historian Richard Baker said mail increased with the advent of C-SPAN, 
which allows constituents to watch their lawmakers at work on live television. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got more thought-out letters from retirees who are irritated or have an 
idea" after seeing some hearing on C-Span, he said. "But the hate mail and the 
threats, they haven't been as affected. They've been around as long as there 
have been politicians." 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Maxine Waters, one of 10black women in Congress, said she likes nothing 
better than to personally telephone hate-mail writers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I call and say: 'Hi! This is Maxine Waters. How ya doin? I got your letter.' 
And I just listen to the silence. I disarm them." 
</P>
<P>
 Waters, a Los Angeles Democrat, once made time to write back to most 
correspondents who used racial insults. "Politicians are so mealy mouthed, 
they're afraid to take such people to task. I let them know they couldn't talk 
to Maxine Waters like that. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now I don't have the time. You can't change people." 
</P>
<P>
 While racially charged letters represent 15% of her daily mail, some include 
threats that are a federal crime -- such as the one that said Waters would soon 
be "riddled with bullets." 
</P>
<P>
 House and Senate postal officials take death threats seriously. In a House 
office building basement, incoming mail is X-rayed and subjected to precautions 
that officials refuse to discuss. 
</P>
<P>
 "We call the Capitol police several times a month," said Paul Lozito, 
assistant director of House mail operations. "While we haven't received any 
letter bombs that we know of, we've confiscated bullets and fireworks." 
</P>
<P>
 But Waters scoffs at the suggestion of sending such letters to the House 
sergeant-at-arms, as security officials instruct lawmakers to do. 
</P>
<P>
 Hate mail, Waters said, lets her know she's doing her job. "The only thing it 
does is strengthen my resolve," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Now she keeps a file to show the perverse attention she has generated as one 
of Washington's most outspoken politicians. 
</P>
<P>
 "You get letters from people who hate you," she said. "Sometimes, I feel that 
one day I'm going to be walking in a crowd and somebody is going to come up and 
stab me. I'm not afraid. But I know it's possible."

POLITICS '94: A BEHIND-THE-SCENES LOOK AT ORANGE COUNTY'S POLITICAL LIFE ; 
ROHRABACHER RIVAL CALLS RACE 'COMPETITIVE' BUT INCUMBENT THINKS NOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
Compiled by Times political writer Gebe Martinez, with contributions from staff

<P>
 Consider the source: Hoping to show that his candidacy isn't as much of a long 
shot as mournful political pundits might think, Democratic congressional 
candidate Brett Williamson released a poll last week showing the Republican 
incumbent, Rep. Dana Rohrabacher of Huntington Beach, with a low approval 
rating and with one-third of the voters not knowing him well enough to rate 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 The survey of 508 voters in the 45th Congressional District--taken in late 
June and early July--showed that 32% of the voters gave Rohrabacher an 
"excellent" or "good" rating and that 25% gave him a "fair" grade. 
</P>
<P>
 Williamson, who calls himself a "moderate mainstream Democrat," concedes the 
poll "does not indicate we are going to sweep easily to victory in November." 
But he maintains the district is "much more competitive than is generally 
thought. This district has a very large number of independent voters." 
</P>
<P>
 Rohrabacher supposedly did not give the poll a second thought. "Consider the 
source" is the phrase that "says it all," Rohrabacher's spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Money isn't everything: Final campaign finance reports for the local June 7 
primary show the big loser on election day was indeed Huntington Beach 
businesswoman Haydee V. Tillotson. Not only did she miss a place in the 
November run-off election for the Board of Supervisors District 2 seat, but she 
also paid dearly for her third place finish behind Huntington Beach Councilman 
Jim Silva and Huntington Beach Mayor Linda Moulton Patterson. 
</P>
<P>
 According to reports filed with the registrar of voters, Tillotson lent her 
election committee $432,000--including a final $90,000 personal loan that she 
took out on election day. Ironically, Silva, who had the most trouble raising 
money during the primary campaign, received the most votes.  
</P>
<P>
 In the 70th Assembly District, Republican candidate Marilyn C. Brewer had 
better luck. She barely won the three-way contest in the conservative coastal 
district, even though she funneled $240,000 in personal loans to her campaign.

 Silva's silver: Silva's friend Supervisor Roger R. Stanton recently invited 
prospective donors to a $1,000-a-plate luncheon and requested that invitees 
bring along a "business associate" who could also give $1,000. But the event 
was mysteriously canceled. "A lot of people are working on my behalf, but I 
don't know anything about that side of it," Silva said.

 Heroes are exempt: A group seeking to limit House members to six years of 
service and U.S. senators to 12 years recently named three local congressmen 
"term limits heroes" because of their support for a term limits amendment. 
Reps. Robert K. Dornan (R-Garden Grove), Jay C. Kim (R-Diamond Bar) and Ed 
Royce (R-Fullerton) were the only Californians recognized by the group. 
</P>
<P>
 Kim and Royce are still a few years away from meeting the term limit standard 
advocated by the group. Dornan, who has long advocated term limits, has pledged 
that if he wins reelection in November to his ninth term, it will be his last. 
That's right, ninth term, as in 18 years in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't ask members to limit themselves to those term limits," said Ron 
Nehring, the congressional affairs director for the U.S. Term Limits group. 
"What we are interested in is national limits. They signed contracts pledging 
they would support limits in Congress."

 Community property: LaVonne Campbell, a retired police detective and the wife 
of ousted Newport Beach police chief Arb Campbell, is considering challenging 
Newport Beach Councilman John W. Hedges in the Nov. 8 election. 
</P>
<P>
 If she does run, Campbell said, she doesn't expect her candidacy to be hurt by 
the allegations of sexual misconduct against her husband that led to his firing 
and are now part of a lawsuit scheduled for trial next year. 
</P>
<P>
 "My family is still somewhat battered," she said. But Arb "would support me in 
any way he could, and I couldn't imagine that people would hold that ancient 
history against me." Campaign Spending 
</P>
<P>
 Incumbent Republican congressmen have a huge lead over their Democratic 
challengers in money raised for the current campaigns. Reps. Jay Kim (R-Diamond 
Bar) and Robert K. Dornan (R-Garden Grove), in particular, have buried their 
opponents. Money raised and spent between Jan. 1 and June 30, and cash on hand

WAVE OF FREEBIES GREETS VISITORS TO SURF EXPO; EVENT: BOOTHS SET UP ON THE SAND 
AT THE U.S. OPEN OF SURFING ARE GIVING AWAY POSTERS, CASSETTES AND MORE. SKIN 
CANCER SCREENINGS AND MASSAGES ARE ALSO AVAILABLE.

 When Denoal Goffaux came to watch the U.S. Open of Surfing on Saturday 
afternoon, he got more than he bargained for. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to watching several hours of world-class surfing competition, the 
25-year-old tourist from Belgium walked away with free pop music cassettes, 
posters, magazines, stickers and cups. 
</P>
<P>
 "I walked by and saw all of these people receiving free things so I thought 
maybe I could get some too," Goffaux said as he peered into a bright yellow 
Tower Records bag filled with freebies. 
</P>
<P>
 Goffaux was among the thousands of spectators at the surfing contest who also 
visited the more than 50 display booths that made up the U.S. Open Surf Expo, 
held on the sand only yards away from the competition. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other things, the expo -- which continues until 5 p.m. today -- offers 
the latest in surf wear and surf products, surfboard shaping demonstrations, 
and a variety of giveaways from radio stations, record companies and nonprofit 
organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's kind of like going to the mall," said 12-year-old Tiffany Chao, who 
emerged from the Warner Records booth with a free soundtrack to the film 
"Endless Summer II," stickers, a megaphone and a calender featuring the band 
R.E.M. 
</P>
<P>
 "The best part is, it's all free," said Chao, a resident of Fountain Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 The Warner Records booth, which resembled a hut on Gilligan's Island, was 
jammed with people drawn by a music cassette giveaway, video screens and 
pounding rock music. 
</P>
<P>
 "This has been fantastic," said 31-year-old Michael Merrins, an employee for 
the record company. "It's been nutty all day, people everywhere." 
</P>
<P>
 Also popular was a makeshift Tower Records store set up on the sand just south 
of the city pier. Employees there reported brisk sales of vintage surf music, 
including a CD boxed set of Annette Funicello songs. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of the older customers are buying the surf music," said 19-year-old 
cashier Rachal Easton. 
</P>
<P>
 Tower sales manager David Miller, 28, said the expo provided his Costa Mesa 
store with invaluable exposure. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been great," Miller said. "It's not so much a moneymaker as it is good 
advertisement. It's been a lot of fun being here on the beach. The only hard 
part is packing up all the CDs every day." 
</P>
<P>
 Other booths stressed health and safety for surfers. Several organizations 
participated in the expo to expound on such surfing-related risks as skin 
cancer and spinal cord injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 "People don't think about how dangerous it can be when they just go jumping 
into the water," said Kris O'Neal, a registered nurse representing Project 
Wipeout, an educational program at Hoag Memorial Hospital Presbyterian in 
Newport Beach that stresses neck and spinal cord injury prevention. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bottom of the ocean shifts all the time and people can break their 
necks," O'Neal said. "This (expo) was the perfect venue for us to reach a lot 
of people." 
</P>
<P>
 A medical team from UC Irvine was on hand to offer free ear exams and skin 
cancer screenings. 
</P>
<P>
 "Surfers get a lot of sun so we're seeing a lot of precancerous things that 
should be looked at," said Dr. Jay Applebaum, who conducted the skin cancer 
screenings. 
</P>
<P>
 Another booth offered a quick massage for surfers and spectators alike. A neck 
and between-the-shoulder-blades rub was available for $5; a neck, back and 
shoulder rub went for $8 and "the deluxe," which was a combination of both, 
cost $10. 
</P>
<P>
 Surfer Sam Seaweed paid for the deluxe massage and said it was well worth it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I surf lots of hours so I use all those muscles," he said. "It's good to have 
them worked out."

5 MERCHANTS FIGHT TOLLWAY AGENCY; TRANSPORTATION: SOME BITTERLY COMPLAIN THAT 
CORRIDOR OFFICIALS HAVEN'T OFFERED A FAIR PRICE TO UPROOT THEM AND THEY FACE 
FINANCIAL RUIN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Nearly five years ago, David Velton spent $50,000 to improve a patch of dirt 
so he could open a used-car dealership on a part of Camino Capistrano that 
fronts Interstate 5. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Velton suddenly finds himself in the path of progress, with a deadline to 
move out, financial worries and a grudge over how he feels government is 
treating him. 
</P>
<P>
 He's not going without a fight. And he's not alone. 
</P>
<P>
 The San Joaquin Hills Transportation Corridor is displacing Velton's small 
lot, and he and four other merchants on that section of Camino Capistrano must 
relocate by mid-October. 
</P>
<P>
 The corridor agency wants them gone to make way for construction of the 
$800-million, 15-mile-long toll road that is touted as a cure for hundreds of 
thousands of motorists in South County. The agency needs the properties for the 
toll road's interchange with Interstate 5, and for the widening of the freeway 
between Mission Viejo and San Juan Capistrano. 
</P>
<P>
 Some business owners bitterly complain that the agency hasn't offered a fair 
price to uproot them and that having to relocate bodes financial ruin. They 
have hired attorneys or consultants. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're just steamrolling us," said Velton, who received a 90-day notice last 
month. "What they are doing here is taking my business away that I've worked 
five years to build up. Their method of helping is absolutely none." 
</P>
<P>
 Velton said he refinanced his house to start his business. Because real estate 
values have plummeted, he doesn't have the cash now to start over, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 A few doors down, Horacio Cuellar feels no better. 
</P>
<P>
 Cuellar estimates he has $110,000 invested in displays for his business, 
Horacio's Marble & Granite. He won't be able to save any of the displays when 
the building is razed for the toll road, he said, and he won't be fully 
compensated for his loss. 
</P>
<P>
 "They don't want to pay me what I have in this showroom," Cuellar said. "Let 
me explain it to you this way: If you cut off my hand and then return it later, 
I want the same size hand, not one with shorter or longer fingers." 
</P>
<P>
 Cuellar said $42,000 has been offered to compensate for the displays and other 
equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 "What the hell do they know about marble?" Cuellar asked. "I've been in it for 
14 years." 
</P>
<P>
 Lisa Telles, a spokeswoman for the Orange County Transportation Corridor 
Agencies, denies that business owners are being treated unfairly. She said they 
are tenants -- not landowners -- who will receive compensation for the cost to 
pack, move and reinstall business equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 Any compensation for buildings or improvements are left for landowners and 
merchants to work out, Telles said. 
</P>
<P>
 Merchants who are unhappy with relocation offers should work with right-of-way 
agents, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "My understanding is that negotiations are still taking place," Telles said. 
"Depending on where they are in the process, there are points where they can 
negotiate." 
</P>
<P>
 But Cuellar said he has yet to receive a breakdown of the agency's appraisal 
for the marble displays. He said he has asked several times. 
</P>
<P>
 Telles said eminent domain proceedings can be frightening because they give 
government the authority to take property, but he said the process follows 
long-held Caltrans guidelines and state law. 
</P>
<P>
 Compensation for intangibles, such as how many prospective customers drive by 
a business each day, can also part of the negotiations, Telles said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ken Friess, a former San Juan Capistrano mayor who sat on the Transportation 
Corridor Agencies board until 1992, said transportation officials were friendly 
at first with Cuellar but, with deadlines approaching, they now seem less 
willing to listen to concerns. Friess, a contractor who has done business with 
Cuellar, has tried to help him through the ordeal. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's almost like they say, 'You take this, and if you have a problem, sue 
us,' " Friess said. 
</P>
<P>
 Friess said the bureaucracy needs to remember that people's lives are affected 
by its decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think any of it is intentional, to set out to hurt anyone," he said 
of the concerns being razed. "It's a tough hit these people take. They take a 
big hit emotionally." 
</P>
<P>
 Cuellar has hired an attorney who specializes in eminent domain law, and 
Velton has a consultant representing him. 
</P>
<P>
 Stan Zalesny, with Redevelopment Consultants of America, said government 
agencies usually take the "low-cost approach" when negotiating. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not going to knock the agencies," Zalesny said. "They have a job to do. 
We just think they could move a little faster, but they have levels in which 
they have to make approvals. You're dealing with a bureaucracy." 
</P>
<P>
 Zalesny said eminent domain for small businesses can be harsh. 
</P>
<P>
 "Other than death, taxes and divorce, this is probably one of the most 
traumatic things that happens to people," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Velton, who knew of plans for the toll road when he opened his car lot, said 
he figured it would take a decade for construction to begin. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been here almost five years," he said. "Business is getting better every 
year. People finally know I'm here." 
</P>
<P>
 But he will have to start over somewhere else -- if he can afford to. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just happen to be in their way," he said.

CANDLELIGHT VIGIL HONORS BOY 2 YEARS AFTER HIS SLAYING 
</P>

<P>
 Several dozen people gathered at a candlelight vigil honoring the memory of 
LaMoun J. Thames on Saturday evening, marking the second anniversary of the 
teen-ager's death. 
</P>
<P>
 Thames was a 15-year-old student at Taft High School when he was fatally 
stabbed by gang members as he waited for a bus.  
</P>
<P>
 "We represent only a small fraction of the number of hearts that have been 
broken," said Jane F. Lowenthal, with the group Mad About Rising Crime, as she 
gathered with others in the parking lot of the Ralphs supermarket near where 
Thames was stabbed. Thames' mother arranged the vigil with the help of members 
of the victims support group. 
</P>
<P>
 The teen-ager had been waiting for a bus on the corner of Winnetka Avenue and 
Ventura Boulevard that would return him from football practice to his 
South-Central Los Angeles home. 
</P>
<P>
 News of the vigil drew Perry Franks, who lives five minutes away. 
</P>
<P>
 "It just makes me very sad to see what our times have come to," said the 
father of four, as a woman lighted his candle. "A student shouldn't be 
forgotten. A young life lost in such a senseless manner. . . . It could have 
been my kid." 
</P>
<P>
 Last May, Oscar Andres Lopez and a 17-year-old boy were charged with Thames' 
murder after an informant overheard them bragging about stabbing him. They are 
awaiting trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Thames' sister, Shanise Anderson, held up her brother's freshman football 
picture as she scanned the crowd memorializing her brother. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is good to see different faces," she said, smiling at the number of people 
at the vigil who did not know Thames.  
</P>
<P>
 Anderson, who graduated from Taft High in 1992, has decided to attend USC in 
memory of the teen-ager deprived of his own chance to go to college.  
</P>
<P>
 "My brother always wanted to play USC football, so I think I will go there," 
she said. "I am going to do it for him."

MAN FATALLY SHOT WHILE DRIVING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Van Nuys man was fatally shot in his car late Friday while driving through a 
neighborhood here, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 No suspects or motives are known in the killing of John Black, 28, who was 
discovered in the 8200 block of San Fernando Road by paramedics shortly after 
11 p.m., said Lt. Don Hooper of the North Hollywood police station. 
</P>
<P>
 Black, who was found lying face down in his vehicle, was shot once in the 
torso while driving along San Fernando Road, Hooper said. He apparently lost 
control of the vehicle, which careened off a light pole and then came to a stop 
after smashing into a parked car. 
</P>
<P>
 The victim was alive when Fire Department paramedics arrived, but then died at 
the scene.

2 SURVIVE HELICOPTER CRASH-LANDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The pilot of a helicopter and his father survived a crash-landing Saturday 
after the pilot lost control of the helicopter and landed in the back yard of 
his brother's home. Pilot Danny Estes, 37, of Valencia took off from Van Nuys 
Airport in a Robinson R-22 helicopter with his father, Pat Estes, 66, of Van 
Nuys on board. 
</P>
<P>
 About 1 p.m., the younger Estes attempted to land but lost control of the 
aircraft and crashed into his brother's back yard in the 6900 block of Sierra 
Highway, said Sgt. Ron Spear of Sheriff's Information Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
 The pilot and his father were taken to Henry Mayo Newhall Memorial Hospital 
and suffered only minor injuries, a nursing supervisor said. No one on the 
ground was injured. 
</P>
<P>
 Police estimated damage to the helicopter at $80,000. There was no damage to 
any structures, Spears said. 
</P>
<P>
 The cause of the crash is under investigation, he said.

ALL THEIR KIDS MAKE WEDDING SPECIAL; CEREMONY: HUNDREDS OF GUESTS, MOSTLY 
CURRENT AND FORMER STUDENTS, ATTEND THE SCHOOLYARD MARRIAGE OF TWO TEACHERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The idea was elementary. She's a kindergarten teacher, he teaches art. They 
both love their students, their jobs and their lives at Welby Way School. And 
yes, they love each other, too. 
</P>
<P>
 So why not get married at school -- and invite all the kids? 
</P>
<P>
 "It was, like, totally a natural thing," said Keith Levey, the art teacher's 
best friend. "I mean, where else would they have a wedding?" 
</P>
<P>
 So on Saturday the couple tied the knot on the patio outside the school 
cafeteria. 
</P>
<P>
 "All these people are our friends," said the groom, Mike Herzog, 36, known to 
most of the guests as "Mr. Mike." "I really wanted it here. It's just a natural 
place. I know all the kids and we love them. We couldn't expect them to go to 
someplace that was indoors and stuffy." 
</P>
<P>
 The bride, 30-year-old Claire McKee-Herzog, said: "We're usually here until 5 
or 6 at night anyway, so we kind of live here. All the parents, all the kids 
wanted us to get married, so why not here?" 
</P>
<P>
 About 300 attended the school wedding, which was decorated with the art 
teacher's sketches of Peter Pan, Mickey Mouse and other characters. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the guests were students or former students of the couple. During the 
ceremony, guests sat on plastic school benches. Afterward, they ate cake and 
took home refrigerator magnets as mementos. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the grade-school setting, the couple dressed as if they were being 
married in a grand cathedral. He -- with hair gelled and mustache trimmed -- 
wore a black tuxedo with a lavender flower in his lapel. The bride wore a white 
wedding dress with a veil and sweeping train. 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward she showed off her ring to admiring students. 
</P>
<P>
 Kelly Skidmore, a former student, now in sixth grade, gave one reason why the 
bride was everyone's favorite teacher: "She barely yells." 
</P>
<P>
 "She made everything fun," added 10-year-old Shannan Manley. "When you lost a 
tooth, she would put it on the board so everyone could see it. Or with the 
alphabet, we would bring in things that stared with A, like an ant." 
</P>
<P>
 The two teachers said their families approved of the wedding plans. 
</P>
<P>
 "The children are their life," said Dorna McKee, Claire's stepmother. "Even 
when they don't have to be at school, they're at school. This couldn't be more 
appropriate." 
</P>
<P>
 The couple met when Herzog's daughter was a student in McKee's kindergarten 
class. Herzog was divorced and McKee wasn't seeing anyone. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I waited until back-to-school night," Herzog said. "I got there and 
told everyone to kinda go ahead of me, so I could be the last one. When I asked 
her out, she said, 'I'll give it a thought.' " 
</P>
<P>
 After she agreed, Herzog said, "We spent our first date watching the Doo Dah 
Parade on TV."

 Three candidates are running in the Nov. 8 election to represent the 47th 
Congressional District. They are Democrat Gary Kingsbury of Irvine, Libertarian 
Victor A. Wagner Jr. of Mission Viejo and Republican Christopher Cox, the 
incumbent, of Newport Beach. Health Care 
</P>
<P>
 Kingsbury: "Universal health care is an absolute right of every citizen. 
Health care shouldn't be dependent on your job. . . . I worked on (Nebraska 
U.S. Sen.) Bob Kerrey's presidential campaign in 1992 because he brought a 
businessman's perspective to this issue. I don't buy the (Christopher) Cox plan 
of tax credits for health care. Tax adjustments will not correct this problem. 
. . . I support the single-payer system, modeling the Canadian health system. 
(The Canadian-style system would offer health care to all legal residents, 
eliminate health insurance, with the doctors billing the government, and let 
states decide the best way to deliver health services.) We need a system that 
can control costs and provide universal coverage." 
</P>
<P>
 Wagner: Did not respond. 
</P>
<P>
 Cox: "Reducing the cost and increasing the availability of health 
care--without damaging our world-leading quality--must be the goal of reform. 
While the Clinton bill has been withdrawn, I am saddened that the House and 
Senate will force a vote on bills that haven't even been written yet. 
Reportedly, they will contain employer mandates, new payroll taxes and new 
taxes on workers' existing health benefits, which I oppose. Instead of raising 
taxes and adding government, we should restore the individual's 100% tax 
deduction for medical expenses, authorize medical savings accounts, enact 
litigation reform and guarantee portability." Education and Health Care 
Benefits for Illegal Immigrants 
</P>
<P>
 Kingsbury: Opposes the "Save Our State" initiative, the statewide measure on 
the November ballot that would deny public benefits, such as education and 
non-emergency health care, to illegal immigrants. "It violates the rights of 
citizens under the U.S. Constitution and does not solve problems or improve the 
quality of life in California. Immigrant bashing and scapegoating foster crime, 
violence and discrimination. New economic initiatives will bring solutions for 
California workers." 
</P>
<P>
 Wagner: "I favor curtailing benefits for illegal immigrants. I fully support 
the national Libertarian platform in this regard." 
</P>
<P>
 Cox: "Government benefits should not be given to those who break the law. Many 
people around the world wait patiently for their turn to enter America, and our 
country admits more of them than any other nation on Earth. Why should they 
continue to obey our laws if we reward those who break them? Subsidies and 
welfare for illegal aliens are at the heart of illegal immigration." Crime 
</P>
<P>
 Kingsbury: "We must reduce the opportunities for easy access to weapons. My 
opponent voted against the ban on automatic weapons and the Brady bill. I would 
have voted for these bans and would be an advocate to reduce weapons in our 
streets, our neighborhoods and our schools. My vision calls for mandatory 
sentencing for criminals who use weapons. Additionally, I would implement a 
program that would place additional police on the street through a Police 
Corps, where, in exchange for four years of college education and police 
training, participants would serve four years in local police departments." 
</P>
<P>
 Wagner: "I believe that an underlying cause of a lot of the violent crime is 
the 'War on Drugs.' Drug prices are kept artificially high by having the drugs 
be illegal. This causes addicts to commit crimes to obtain monies to support 
their habit. In addition, there are such vast sums of money in this illegal 
trade that we suffer from 'turf wars' and from corruption of our law 
enforcement. I believe that an end to the 'War on Drugs' would be a good first 
step in combatting crime." 
</P>
<P>
 Cox: "Punishment of crimes should be swift, certain, unpleasant and 
inexpensive. California has nearly 400 convicted murderers on Death Row, but 
only one has been executed in over two decades. That's largely because of 
endless federal appeals. The so-called 'crime bill' in Congress weakens the 
death penalty and doles out $8 billion in welfare rather than using that money 
for police, courts and prisons. A solid federal crime bill would repeal the 
exclusionary rule (which prohibits the admission of illegally seized evidence 
in criminal cases), limit endless appeals, impose prison work requirements and 
adopt truth-in-sentencing." El Toro Marine Corps Air Station 
</P>
<P>
 Kingsbury: Opposes the development of a commercial airport at the Marine base. 
"I strongly disagree with Cox's position that El Toro should be sold to the 
highest bidder without any preconditions on how it should be used. How does 
this approach protect the quality of life for us and our children? Is this the 
vision of a leader? My vision for Central and South Orange County is not 
another LAX. Didn't many of us leave Los Angeles because we had a different 
dream? Let's seek 'win-win' solutions like Westcot (the proposed Disneyland 
expansion) that provide economic development and maintain Orange County as a 
land of dreams." 
</P>
<P>
 Wagner: "I believe the land should be auctioned and that the new owner should 
decide what to do with it. If the county is going to control its destiny, I 
neither favor nor oppose its use as an airport. I will not argue against an 
airport." 
</P>
<P>
 Cox: "The base closure commission voted to close El Toro based on the high 
value of the land. It will cost taxpayers over $1 billion to move the Marines 
to Miramar (Naval Air Station in San Diego). Sale of the property was supposed 
to pay for it. I oppose the initiative to zone El Toro exclusively for an 
airport, since this will substantially diminish its value even before we have 
any idea who would pay for an airport, or when. Instead of slashing the worth 
of this valuable asset, we should use the federal base closure funds to 
advertise the availability of the property and see who is willing to pay how 
much, and for what uses."

FACING HURDLES; SPECIAL EDUCATION TRACK PROGRAM SEEKS FUNDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNEDY COSGROVE and JEANNETTE REGALADO, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An experiment allowing special education students to participate side by side 
with other high school athletes has become everything its supporters hoped: a 
program that has coaches, teachers and students singing its praises. 
</P>
<P>
 But five years after the city's Section AA track program athletes began 
competing against each other in high school meets, the future of the program is 
still uncertain because it lacks a permanent funding source, Los Angeles 
Unified School District officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The district supported the program for the first few years. When the budget 
dwindled and the program was about to be cut, Special Olympics International 
stepped in with a $250,000 grant to fund the program and other efforts for two 
years. The grant expired in June, school officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are trying to find funding to replace the grant money," said Beverly 
Watkins, director of special education programs for LAUSD. "Everybody is 
diligently working on it." 
</P>
<P>
 The annual cost is $36,000, including $15,000 for a dozen coaches' salaries, 
$19,000 for buses to shuttle the special education students home from campus, 
and about $2,000 for awards and equipment, school officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Food for Less Foundation donated $1 million to the cash-strapped LAUSD for 
high school athletics this year, but school officials have not decided whether 
those funds can be used for the AA track program, said Bill Rivera, a spokesman 
for LAUSD. 
</P>
<P>
 In the program, special education students compete in the 100-meter dash, the 
long jump, high jump and shot put. 
</P>
<P>
 During meets, they wear the same uniforms as their high school track team, 
ride the team bus and can earn varsity letters. They practice twice a week, and 
top contenders in league and conference championships go to the city finals on 
the same day as the other athletes. 
</P>
<P>
 The intent, say supporters, is to allow special education students to mingle 
with other students, something that rarely happens in the classroom. 
</P>
<P>
 "Until they work together, they will never get to know about each others' 
lives," said Barbara Fiege, LAUSD director of interscholastic athletics. 
"Athletics are for all students, whether they are handicapped or not." 
</P>
<P>
 Similar programs for special education students recently started in New York, 
Miami, Kansas City, San Antonio, Milwaukee and Cleveland, in an effort to meet 
the Special Olympics' goal of doubling the 1 million athletes worldwide who 
participated in its activities this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Last May, 175 athletes from 18 schools met at Birmingham High School for the 
city finals. 
</P>
<P>
 Fiege said it was there that she realized the program's full impact. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Spectators) were just as interested when an AA race began and would cheer 
even more because they could really see from (the athletes') faces how much it 
meant to them," Fiege said. 
</P>
<P>
 But more importantly, Fiege said, is the effect on the special education 
athletes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like running fast," said Curtis Wang, a sophomore member of the Granada 
Hills High AA team who took fourth place in the high jump at the city finals. 
"I like the long jump best because you can jump into the sand. It feels good." 
</P>
<P>
 Others agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're beautiful kids to work with," said Obbie Brown, the Sylmar High track 
coach for the past 18 years, about the mentally and physically handicapped 
students in the program. "They're very, very lovable, and (the program) is a 
big benefit to them." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials say the LAUSD program has blossomed into one of the country's most 
successful. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really becoming our model program to show the rest of the world how it's 
done," said Troy Greisen, the western U.S. regional director for Special 
Olympics International. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've really grown," agreed Pat Harvey, the program's Los Angeles director. 
</P>
<P>
 Harvey has been with the program since its inception five years ago, when 
Special Olympics International officials approached then-City Commissioner Hal 
Harkness with a proposal to start the program in Los Angeles, which would 
provide an ideal backdrop with its diverse cityscape. 
</P>
<P>
 But Harvey had to overcome some obstacles. 
</P>
<P>
 "First of all, we had to convince the schools and the coaches that this was 
not necessarily going to infringe on them directly," Harvey said. "And we had 
to get busing so transportation would not be difficult." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Gradually, the Valley Pac-8 Conference, a league in the LAUSD's high school 
sports teams, was added to the program and the response from schools was 
excellent. Harvey said five of the eight schools in the league developed teams, 
led by conference champion Sylmar with 28 athletes. Granada Hills of the 
Northwest Valley Conference also fielded a team this season. 
</P>
<P>
 At a dinner this summer for representatives from participating schools, the 
event ran two hours past its scheduled close as coaches and administrators told 
story after story of kids helped by the program. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the highlight of these kids' year," said Harvey. 
</P>
<P>
 And she and others remain optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it will continue on," Greisen said. "In five years, it has ingrained 
itself into the school system. Once the community realizes that we want to 
focus on these athletes' capabilities rather than their disabilities, it will 
become an integral part of the varsity sport system."

FIRE DESTROYS THREE APARTMENT UNITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ten people were left temporarily homeless Saturday after a fire destroyed 
three attached apartments in the Islander Luxury Apartment complex, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 When the first of six engine companies arrived at 3:41 p.m. at the complex at 
2724 N. Bristol St., firefighters found the roof of the single-story apartments 
engulfed in flames, said Art Del Gaudio, acting battalion chief of the Santa 
Ana Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
 It took firefighters 45 minutes to control the blaze, which, because of the 
wind, touched off several small spot fires on nearby roofs in the complex, 
including one a quarter-mile away, Del Gaudio said. 
</P>
<P>
 Firefighters quickly controlled the spot fires and prevented them from doing 
serious damage, Del Gaudio said. 
</P>
<P>
 "A couple of palm trees started burning and they were sending embers all over 
the place in the wind," Del Gaudio said. 
</P>
<P>
 Damage to the apartments -- which all share the same roof -- were estimated at 
more than $200,000. Del Gaudio said investigators have determined that the fire 
started in the one vacant apartment of the three, but the cause remains under 
investigation.

FLUNKING THE STATE'S 'SCENIC' TEST; CALABASAS GRADE MAY LOOK LOVELY TO 
URBANITES, BUT CALTRANS TRAVELS A HIGHER ROAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The state had some news recently for motorists who get a lift from seeing the 
rolling countryside around Calabasas and points west: It's not really scenic. 
It only looks scenic. 
</P>
<P>
 Meeting in Sacramento, a committee of Caltrans refused to designate the 
Ventura Freeway from Calabasas to Thousand Oaks as a state scenic highway. The 
unprecedented action -- which is final, barring a successful appeal to the 
transportation department's director -- was a rebuff to civic leaders who 
wanted to add the freeway segment to 1,096 miles of officially lovely 
California roads. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee relied on the by-the-numbers sensibilities of Caltrans staffers. 
Two of them rode up and down the 21 miles, eyeing the highway disapprovingly. 
They graded it 1 to 2.9 out of a possible 5, deducting points for "a high 
amount of development," including advertising signs. 
</P>
<P>
 Signs played a big part in the debate before the committee. Some people 
seeking a scenic designation also oppose towering "pole signs," which were 
rejected by voters in Agoura Hills last year and are now the subject of an 
industry lawsuit. The sign industry spotted a link and opposed the scenic 
designation. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Caltrans officials say, pole signs tend to keep out the scenic 
designation, not vice versa, since it does not affect local cities' right to 
decide the signs' fate. Cities on scenic highways are eligible for 
billboard-removal money, however. 
</P>
<P>
 Now it's true that the freeway view, a mixture of the pastoral and the paved, 
doesn't take your breath away. Still, if a scenic designation would have helped 
preserve or improve it, the state decision is regrettable. The Calabasas Grade 
isn't exactly the Angeles Crest Highway, but then the Angeles Crest isn't 
exactly the Big Sur. As you drop westward on the freeway into the Conejo 
Valley, you do have the liberating feeling of being out in the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans will study asking the Legislature to create a lower level of 
recognition for roads that look scenic only to urbanites. Meanwhile, signs that 
won't be cluttering the 101 are the ones with the little poppies that mean 
"scenic highway."

NEEDLESS ROADBLOCKS WON'T SOLVE BUILDING ISSUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * If one were to take the Silvers' July 31 article criticizing the speeding up 
of the city development permits seriously, one would think that they had the 
answer to the Valley's building problems. 
</P>
<P>
 The homeowners association of which they are members protested the 
construction of the building at the southeast corner of Ventura Boulevard and 
Woodman Avenue.The building permit was delayed. The owner of the property went 
into bankruptcy fighting City Hall for a permit to build, and the boarded-up 
stores have been in such disrepair that they resemble the worst blight in any 
commercial area of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The "do-gooder" homeowners associations, by throwing unnecessary road blocks 
in front of Ventura Boulevard construction, have caused builders such expense 
that they either bankrupted the builder or cause the costs to go up so much 
that the project is not economically sound.

KEEPING A VOICE ON THE CITY COUNCIL; QUAKE-TORN VALLEY MUST HAVE A REPLACEMENT 
WHEN ZEV YAROSLAVSKY LEAVES OFFICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Zev Yaroslavsky's election as county supervisor could leave a major gap on the 
Los Angeles City Council, since it's quite possible that whoever is elected to 
serve the last two years of his term won't take office until mid-1995. 
</P>
<P>
 As Yaroslavsky and several San Fernando Valley civic leaders noted last week, 
the 5th District could lack representation during a crucial earthquake recovery 
period. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of them fear that without a champion, the southeast Valley would be 
vulnerable to unfair distribution of city money and services. And constituents 
would find it difficult to get help at City Hall, since Yaroslavsky intends to 
take key city staffers to his new county job. 
</P>
<P>
 Yaroslavsky's June 7 victory will remove him from the City Council on Dec. 5. 
The election to replace him will be in April, but a runoff, if necessary, will 
not occur until June, and a swearing-in about July 1. 
</P>
<P>
 The prospect is not reassuring. In theory and in practice, every part of the 
city needs an elected representative to protect its interests, and the south 
Valley has a special need now. 
</P>
<P>
 The area was hit hard by the Jan. 17 quake. By early 1995, steps could be 
under way to create a redevelopment area to speed recovery in the Ventura 
Boulevard corridor. 
</P>
<P>
 "To have no one on City Council for seven months will set back the rebuilding 
process tremendously," says Richard Close, the Sherman Oaks Homeowners Assn. 
president. He also thinks developers would "have a field day" without a council 
member watchdog. His concerns may be exaggerated, but maybe not. 
</P>
<P>
 More prosaically, many decisions affecting neighborhoods are routinely left to 
their individual council members. An empty seat would leave decisions to 
distant bureaucrats. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1966, the council has not used its appointing power to fill any of 10 
vacancies. Council President John Ferraro says letting a City Hall staffer do 
business for vacant offices has worked fine in the past. But precedent should 
not be the only guide. The district's situation is critical; the prospective 
vacancy, long. 
</P>
<P>
 Any interim appointment has to be made before the end of the five-day period 
in January in which spring candidates for the seat must file to run. To avoid 
giving anyone an undeserved advantage of incumbency, the council can demand a 
solemn non-candidacy pledge. 
</P>
<P>
 It should be able to find a super-temp, an experienced leader to do the job. 
If there are compelling reasons not to, they have not yet been brought forth.

PROGRAM GIVES TENANTS A NEW LEASE ON LIFE; SYLMAR DEAL OFFERS RESIDENTS A VOICE 
AND PROTECTS LOW RENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A real estate deal in Sylmar represents the first use in Los Angeles of an 
important federal effort to preserve low-income housing that might otherwise be 
priced out of the reach of the poor. 
</P>
<P>
 Tenants of the Astoria Gardens Apartments have formed a nonprofit association 
that intends to buy the 136-unit complex. If the deal goes through as expected, 
it appears that everyone will win: 
</P>
<P>
 * The tenants will get to help run the complex and keep paying 
government-subsidized low rents, which otherwise might have zoomed from 30% of 
their incomes to the market level. 
</P>
<P>
 * The five hospitals that own the complex will get its appraised value, $7.579 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 * Perhaps most significantly in the long run, Astoria Gardens -- like 
thousands of other low-income apartments built with government aid 2 1/2 
decades ago -- will remain part of the stock of housing available to poor 
people. 
</P>
<P>
 The purchase, one of Southern California's first like it, had its roots in the 
1960s. 
</P>
<P>
 The nation was disenchanted with public-housing projects that turned overnight 
into dangerous high-rise slums. Turning to the private sector, Congress 
authorized low-interest construction loans backed or made by the government. 
Rent in the new housing would be a manageable part of tenants' income, with 
government aid filling the gap up to the private market level. The law 
envisioned housing available to the poor for 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
 It all happened during the free-spending days of the "War on Poverty," and 
some experts say the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development 
apparently expected a quick victory on the housing front. It wrote regulations 
under the law that promised to let owners pay off their mortgages and get out 
of the low-income housing business in only 20 years. Many owners moved to do so 
in the inflationary 1980s when property values boomed. They created what 
low-income housing experts call the "prepayment" crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem is potentially substantial. In Los Angeles, 10,382 units could be 
shifted to fully private status by prepayment, according to David Etezadi of 
the California Mutual Housing Assn. and a consultant for Astoria Gardens 
tenants. That is more than one-fifth of the federally funded housing for the 
poor in a city where 40,000 people are on waiting lists for rent subsidies. 
</P>
<P>
 Congress declared a moratorium on prepayments in 1987 -- some outraged owners 
filed lawsuits -- then addressed the subject fully in a 1990 law giving 
residents the right to buy when owners want to get out. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a lengthy, lawyer-intensive process that includes aid to residents in 
organizing themselves. With HUD approval, Astoria Gardens could pass to the 
tenants in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ownership" here is a misleading term. Tenants won't pocket any money or keep 
shares in the building when they move. 
</P>
<P>
 What they will get is a voice in decisions now made by others. "They will be 
in control of their own destiny," says Mona Tawatao, an attorney working with 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 Skeptics say they'll learn that running low-income properties is no picnic. 
Perhaps. But headaches are the price of independence. We applaud their resolve 
and wish them well.

PIERCE COLLEGE FARM IS AN ASSET TO COMMUNITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Dr. M. Stephen Sheldon's letter to the editor of July 24 "Pierce College: 
Bigger Isn't Necessarily Better," states, "There is no such thing as the Pierce 
College Farm." This statement is outdated, shortsighted and does a disservice 
to the college. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Sheldon correctly states that there are several agricultural programs in 
horticulture and animal science. He neglects to mention that the enrollment in 
these programs is above the state average for class size. He states that the 
students enrolled in agricultural programs represent 4% of the student 
population while "taking up more than 50% of the land." 
</P>
<P>
 Are we to translate this concept into square footage of classroom utilization 
and eliminate those programs that use relatively more space? At Pierce College, 
the quality and need for an instructional program are based neither on square 
footage nor on acreage. 
</P>
<P>
 The value of the Pierce College Farm goes far beyond enrollment in the 
instructional program. The farm is a unique asset to the college and to the 
community. 
</P>
<P>
 On July 4, more than 150 volunteers from the community and from the college -- 
including students, faculty, staff and administrators -- worked together to put 
on a "farm walk." The wonderment of a 3-year-old toddler looking a Suffolk ewe 
in the eye, or a teen-ager petting a horse for the first time, or families 
walking together through the pasture taking in the aroma of freshly turned 
earth would convince anyone that the farm is an asset that needs to be fostered 
rather than disparaged. 
</P>
<P>
 At the southwest corner of the farm is a canyon that serves as a nature 
preserve for students in the biological programs as well as interested 
community members. Red-winged black birds, owls and egrets are among the birds 
sighted there as well as the occasional monarch butterfly. Canada geese visit 
each year on their annual migration. Where else in the Los Angeles Basin can 
one find comparable agricultural and natural treasures? 
</P>
<P>
 The Pierce College acreage forms an integral part of its master plan. Nothing 
in the plan includes "doing away with" the agricultural programs, "dismissing 
the agricultural faculty" or getting rid of the small herds of cattle, swine, 
sheep and horses. 
</P>
<P>
 At a time when Pierce College is making every effort to reverse enrollment 
declines, bring expenditures under control, implement improvement of 
facilities, work with the residential and business communities, maintain a 
balanced and quality instructional program and develop a master plan that will 
make Pierce College a showcase for the greater Los Angeles area and the state, 
we welcome positive, constructive input from individuals. 
</P>
<P>
 Naysayers contribute little to the successful future of Pierce College.

 * While certain points of Sheldon's cynical commentary about the Pierce 
College Farm may ring true, I feel that the larger issue at hand was ignored. 
</P>
<P>
 I work at the farm with 10 urban high school students as part of the city of 
Los Angeles' Summer Youth in the Environment Program. The students are involved 
in restoring the horticulture unit and growing grounds of the farm, in addition 
to many other projects. 
</P>
<P>
 I must say that it is obvious that the farm has fallen into an unfortunate 
state of neglect, yet it still has the potential to give urban students the 
opportunity to learn firsthand about the land they live on.  
</P>
<P>
 For most of these students, this is their first experience being on a farm, 
and it opened their eyes to a whole new world. Many of these young adults are 
now interested in studying horticulture and animal studies at Pierce College, 
an option they would perhaps never have known was open to them had it not been 
for the farm. 
</P>
<P>
 Since being on the farm, I have met many citizens and students who are active 
in trying to save the Pierce College Farm from being developed for commercial 
ventures. Perhaps positive changes would occur if their suggestions and ideas 
were listened to and taken seriously. 
</P>
<P>
 The farm remains a valuable teaching tool and is one of the few places in Los 
Angeles County where people can learn about agriculture -- hands-on. 
Agriculture is still California's largest industry.

THE POWER OF TELEVISION TO BRING PEOPLE TOGETHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Paul Clarke did a marvelous job at recounting various events brought into 
his Washington home via television ("Gathering at the TV for a Communal 
Experience," July 17). However, it is important to remember that Southern 
Californians were the first to experience the medium's ability to bring people 
together. 
</P>
<P>
 On April 9 and 10, 1949, Southlanders were transfixed by the effort to rescue 
3 1/2-year-old Kathy Fiscus, who had fallen into a San Marino well. The 
legendary late television pioneer Klaus Landsberg dispatched a mobile unit and 
reporters Stan Chambers and Bill Welsh for what was destined to become 27 hours 
of continuous live coverage of an unscheduled news event.  
</P>
<P>
 "It really brought the city together," Chambers recalled in a special 
television program last year commemorating his career. "Los Angeles was a big 
city, but on that weekend, it became a small-town city. Neighbors would visit 
neighbors they didn't know very well. They'd sit in front of the set, they'd 
have dinner there, they'd go to sleep on the floor. The whole city suffered a 
personal loss."

MORE PLANES WON'T MEAN MORE 'SIGNIFICANT' NOISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Contrary to "Airport's Neighbors Blast Expansion Plan" (July 28), the 
supplement to the Burbank Airport Replacement Terminal Environmental Impact 
Report did not state that the terminal project would have no adverse effects. 
</P>
<P>
 The supplement, like the 1992 EIR, identified several areas of significant 
environmental impact as defined by the California Environmental Quality 
Act.Mitigation measures for these impacts were also identified. 
</P>
<P>
 The primary area of public debate is whether aircraft noise will increase 
because of a new terminal and whether such an increase will be "significant" as 
defined by state government. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, there will be more planes and indeed more noise. But even if it is 
assumed all increases in air carrier and commuter flights after a new terminal 
is built are due solely to the new terminal the analysis shows residential 
areas around the airport would not experience a "significant" increase in noise 
exposure, as defined by federal and state standards. 
</P>
<P>
 The potential impact that could result if some or all of the increases in 
flights could be attributed to the new terminal are what the Superior Court 
ordered the Airport Authority to look at when it sent the report back to us for 
further analysis. We have tried our best to perform that task, and it will be 
up to the court to tell us whether we succeeded.

TIME TO CLOSE THE LOPEZ CANYON LANDFILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Let us not be overly impressed by the award to the Lopez Canyon Landfill 
from the Solid Waste Assn. of America (July 16). 
</P>
<P>
 This award was actively sought by the Bureau of Sanitation.We do not know the 
criteria for the award. We do know that this spring the South Coast Air Quality 
Management District refused to write a letter of endorsement and that, under 
political pressure, it withdrew a notice of violation. Meanwhile, just last 
week, ground water was found only 20 feet under the landfill in direct contact 
with trash, despite assurances to the contrary over the years. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the award should also go to the landfill's neighbors who have met 
monthly with the Bureau of Sanitation and continually pressured it to comply 
with regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 It is time to close the Lopez Canyon Landfill in 1996 as promised. It is past 
time for the city of Los Angeles to take responsibility by seeking alternatives 
to landfills within populated communities. Allowing Lopez to remain open will 
just allow the Bureau of Sanitation to seek awards instead of viable 
alternatives for trash disposal.

IT'S LOGICAL TO MAINTAIN SAME TANKER OPERATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Without question, pipelining of crude oil from the Point Arguello oil fields 
to Los Angeles refineries would be the most efficient and ultimately the most 
cost-effective mode of transport. 
</P>
<P>
 However, in light of the continuous and negative local city government actions 
and other group pressures, it is highly doubtful that the state Public 
Utilities Commission will ever grant the permits essential to the project's 
progression.And even if the PUC were to one day say "go," predictably there 
would be one huge howl from the offices, agencies and sundry pressure groups 
opposed to a very worthy scheme, with the matter probably tied up in endless 
hearings and in the courts for years. 
</P>
<P>
 In my opinion, the logical solution, as an in-hand alternative to an apparent 
insoluble impasse, is to maintain the faultless coastal tanker operation that 
has been in this particular service for many years. This action could be 
accomplished by a simple extension of the existing temporary tanker transport 
permit (which I understand expired January, 1994) to a time linked to the 
anticipated productive life span of the Point Arguello oil fields.

KEEPING REPEAT OFFENDERS OFF STATE'S ROADS; THE SAFE STREETS ACT WOULD 
PERMANENTLY CONFISCATE VEHICLES OF THOSE WITH SUSPENDED OR REVOKED LICENSES WHO 
GET BEHIND THE WHEEL ANYWAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD KATZ, Richard Katz represents the 39th District in the California 
Assembly. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In May I was saddened and angered to read about Pedro Guzman, a man whose 
5-year-old son was killed when Guzman crashed into another car while he was 
allegedly driving drunk -- again. 
</P>
<P>
 The accident happened in Sun Valley, in the heart of my Assembly district. 
What angered me so much was finding out that Guzman had no driver's license and 
should have not been driving at all. His license had been revoked in 1989 for 
drunk driving. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, Guzman's story is not unique. In the past few months we've 
heard about three youngsters' dying when an unlicensed 15-year-old Santa 
Clarita girl got behind the wheel of a car, and about the Los Angeles 
grandmother who was driving with a suspended California license in Texas and 
killed 14 of her children and grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
 All of these people would be alive today if they were not in cars with 
unlicensed drivers behind the wheel. But current laws aren't working. They 
aren't preventing unlicensed drivers from driving. The Legislature has tried 
raising fines and increasing penalties only to have repeated drunk drivers 
waltz out of courtrooms and back into their cars after having their licenses 
suspended or revoked by judges. 
</P>
<P>
 The Department of Motor Vehicles estimates that a driver with a suspended 
license is four times as likely to be in a fatal accident as a licensed driver 
and that there are approximately 1,720,000 unlicensed drivers on California 
roads. That's 1.7 million drivers with no license or a suspended or revoked 
license! Furthermore, 75% of those with licenses suspended for drunk driving 
continue to drive and are involved in 15% of all fatal car accidents in the 
state. That's a lot of victims for a preventable crime -- and it is 
preventable. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this year I introduced the Safe Streets Act of 1994 (AB 3148). The 
bill would require anyone who is caught driving without a license or with a 
suspended or revoked license to forfeit their car to the state -- permanently. 
If we take their cars away, they can't kill innocent people. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a punishment that fits the crime. People are using cars illegally and 
are killing and injuring innocent bystanders. A car in the hands of an 
unlicensed driver is as dangerous a weapon as any. 
</P>
<P>
 The Safe Streets Act of 1994 is one of the toughest unlicensed driver's bills 
in the country, and it is necessary. It would not take cars away from those who 
leave their licenses at home or forgot to renew a recently expired license. 
</P>
<P>
 People who have their licenses suspended or revoked are multiple offenders. 
They have been caught repeatedly driving drunk or negligently. They have been 
warned and fined, but have chosen to ignore the law. It's time to take tough 
action against those who threaten our families and friends. 
</P>
<P>
 Some people are concerned that a suspended driver or his family might be 
inconvenienced if a car is taken away. But what about the inconvenience of 
burying a loved one because someone who had no right to be on the road broke 
the law and drove anyway? What about the inconvenient, painful recovery 
accident survivors must endure? 
</P>
<P>
 Driving a car is not a constitutional right. It is a privilege, and some 
people seem to forget that. There are tests that people must take in order to 
get a license, and there are reasons licenses are suspended and revoked. 
</P>
<P>
 The Safe Streets Act of 1994 passed the Assembly in June. On Tuesday it will 
face a tough battle in the Senate Judiciary Committee. Several senators have 
expressed reservations about the bill. They seem more concerned with criminals' 
driving rights than the victims who suffer. 
</P>
<P>
 It's time for people to start taking responsibility for their actions. The 
message is simple: If you want to drive a car in California, start acting like 
a responsible adult and obey the laws of this state, or we're going to take 
your car away -- for good.

CBS PROJECT SHOWS L.A. RIVER NEEDS AN OVERSEER; PROPOSAL TO PAVE OVER TUJUNGA 
WASH DELTA IS A GLARING EXAMPLE OF THE FRAGMENTED AND DIRECTIONLESS AUTHORITY 
ALONG THE RIVER SYSTEM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEWIS MacADAMS, Lewis MacAdams is a member of the board of Friends of the 
Los Angeles River. This is the second of two articles. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The state Coastal Conservancy has just released the "Los Angeles River Park 
and Recreation Area Study," the first-ever assessment of the potential for 
public access, recreation and wildlife enhancement along L.A.'s best-kept 
secret -- the river in our own back yard. 
</P>
<P>
 The document profiles the park and recreation needs of all 12 riverfront 
cities, from Glendale to Long Beach, inventories parklands near the river and 
sets priorities for parkland acquisition. It concludes that the Los Angeles 
River has the potential to become one of our park-poor area's greatest 
recreational resources, a 50-mile greenway from the San Gabriel Mountains to 
the sea. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, as I noted here previously, the study's weakness is its 
political dimension. To achieve its goal of a basin-wide integration of flood 
control, ground-water recharge, habitat and open space uses, the conservancy 
can only recommend a vague "mechanism for coordination" among the riverfront 
cities and the myriad of city, county, state and federal agencies that 
currently exercise fragmented and often directionless authority along the river 
system. 
</P>
<P>
 Nowhere is this problem more glaring than in Studio City, where CBS Studio 
Center proposes to build seven sound stages and a six-story parking garage and 
intends to pave over the delta of the Los Angeles River and the Tujunga Wash 
for parking lots. As proposed, the 245,000-square-foot project, which fronts on 
the Los Angeles River and its major tributary, the Tujunga Wash, for nearly 
half a mile, is a missed opportunity to revitalize the river. It could also 
have a major negative impact on flood control. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 CBS has worked closely with its Studio Center neighbors and City Councilman 
Joel Wachs' office to mitigate the neighborhood impacts. It has agreed to 
screen off the entire project with a 6-foot-high, 10-foot-wide berm planted 
with trees and shrubbery the length of its property along the Tujunga Wash. To 
keep trucks off neighborhood streets, it has promised to route deliveries to 
the sound stages through the existing studio lot. CBS is even working out a 
deal with the county Department of Public Works to build a high enough bridge 
across the river to ensure room for an extension of the Los Angeles River 
Bikeway. 
</P>
<P>
 But more needs to be done. 
</P>
<P>
 Planting native, drought-resistant trees and shrubbery for the Tujunga Wash 
vegetation screen is a relatively simple refinement that costs little, as two 
recent riverfront plantings -- one by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority 
in the Taylor Railroad Yard, another by Northeast Trees at the confluence of 
the Los Angeles and the Arroyo Seco -- have shown. Our organization, Friends of 
the Los Angeles River, can provide lists of plants. Fresh thinking could even 
turn CBS' proposed parking structure into an attractive riverfront lunch place 
for its employees. Friends of Los Angeles River hopes to work with CBS and 
neighbors to accomplish this. 
</P>
<P>
 We are even more concerned about the effects the Studio Center expansion will 
have on flood control. The neighbors around the river's Tujunga Wash confluence 
already face inundation from a 100-year flood, as defined by the Federal 
Emergency Management Agency and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Yet the 
hydraulic effects of building a 6-foot-high berm almost half a mile long on one 
side of the wash are dismissed as a "detail" by William Lillenberg, the city 
Planning Department's zoning administrator. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the delta of the Los Angeles River and the Tujunga Wash is already so 
flood-prone, much of the land within CBS' proposed expansion has remained 
unpaved, which allows some potential floodwaters to be absorbed into the earth. 
Unfortunately, the city Building and Safety Department won't yet allow 
permeable pavements to be used in parking lots, so increased runoff from the 
proposed expansion will drain into the river. What effect will that and other 
similar projects have on the river's flood-control capacity? Nobody is even 
trying to guess. 
</P>
<P>
 A county public works representative says the flood-control issue is a "city 
matter," a strange attitude at a time when the department is scrambling to come 
up with L.A. County's half of a more than $300-million flood-control project on 
the lower Los Angeles River system scheduled to begin next March. The Los 
Angeles County Drainage Area project to build new berms and concrete walls as 
much as eight feet higher for 21 miles from Pico Rivera to Long Beach is 
designed to mitigate the flood effects of exactly the kinds of developments the 
CBS Studio Center expansion represents. 
</P>
<P>
 This lack of coordination among CBS, the city, the county and the Corps of 
Engineers is exactly the kind of problem a countywide Los Angeles River 
Conservancy could solve. But until that day comes, the agencies involved must 
"ad hoc" a way to work together. The CBS Studio Center expansion has 
implications for the entire Los Angeles River corridor. It is too important a 
project at too important a location for it to be so oblivious to the issue of 
flood control.

OFFICIALS TO PITCH FEE FOR LIBRARIES; ASSESSMENTS: PROPOSAL SEEKS TO CHARGE 
PROPERTY OWNERS AN ADDITIONAL YEARLY CHARGE FOR OPERATIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Los Angeles County Public Library officials will hold an open meeting here 
Monday to answer questions and drum up support for a new fee aimed at aiding 
the county's cash-strapped local libraries. 
</P>
<P>
 The county runs 87 libraries, including Lancaster's, among the busiest in the 
system. But the state's budget crisis has led lawmakers in Sacramento to divert 
funds in recent years that formerly went to local libraries. 
</P>
<P>
 Stephen Klein, assistant administrator for the county libraries, said this has 
led to layoffs and a dramatic cut in library hours. The Lancaster branch, which 
used to be open seven days away for 64 hours, now operates four days a week for 
28 hours, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are lines at the reference desk, there are lines to check out books," 
Klein said. "People still need this information." 
</P>
<P>
 To restore some of these services, county officials want to set up a 
Mellos-Roos community facilities district. All property owners in the district 
would pay an additional yearly fee for library operations. 
</P>
<P>
 County library officials have scheduled nine community meetings to discuss 
this proposal. The Lancaster meeting begins at 7 p.m. Monday in the Stanley 
Kleiner Activity Center at Lancaster City Park, 43011 10th St. West. 
</P>
<P>
 Another meeting will be held at 7 p.m. Aug. 15 at Santa Clarita City Hall, 
23920 W. Valencia Blvd., Suite 105. The county operates three libraries in 
Santa Clarita, although one is closed because of earthquake damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Palmdale residents would not be subject to the proposed assessment because 
Palmdale operates its own city library. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the county plan, the owner of a single-family home would pay $28.50 per 
year for library services. Mobile home owners would pay $14.25. Other fees 
would apply to owners of apartment buildings, commercial structures and vacant 
lots. 
</P>
<P>
 Klein said he does not believe the proposed library fee is excessive. "We're 
talking about less than $2.50 a month," he said. "I wonder what people pay for 
cable TV." 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors has scheduled an Aug. 30 public 
hearing on the proposal. But the supervisors can only impose the new fee in 
unincorporated communities. 
</P>
<P>
 In Lancaster, Santa Clarita and other cities served by county libraries, the 
city councils must approve the assessments. 
</P>
<P>
 Klein said the money collected in each city would only be used for the 
libraries that serve that city. Cities that do not adopt the fee would continue 
to face reduced library services, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lancaster Councilwoman Deborah Shelton said she plans to attend Monday's 
meeting to hear residents' reaction to the fee plan. She also wants to hear how 
the county will guarantee that this money will only be used for libraries. 
</P>
<P>
 "Libraries are very important," she said. "But people are really sick of being 
manipulated by government to give money that they think will go to a particular 
cause -- and then it doesn't." 
</P>
<P>
 Some city officials are also hesitant to impose a tax on residents to help pay 
for a county service. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For example, some Lancaster leaders have said they would rather put the issue 
on the ballot for the Nov. 8 election. The Lancaster City Council has scheduled 
a special meeting for 10:30 a.m. Tuesday to decide that question. City Manager 
Jim Gilley said the special meeting is needed because the county 
registrar-recorder's deadline to place measures on the November ballot is Aug. 
12. 
</P>
<P>
 County library officials warned that if cities wait until November, it will be 
too late to collect the fees on this year's property tax bills. Even if voters 
approve the measure, the money would not be available until the fiscal year 
that begins next July 1, they said.

 But Gilley said Tuesday's vote would only preserve an option for the Lancaster 
council. At its regular Aug. 15 meeting, the council will consider several 
alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
 One alternative would be to impose the library fee for one year, then let 
voters decide in November whether to continue collecting it.

THE PERFECT 10; LITTLE DID THE WORLD KNOW THAT MARY LOU RETTON HAD UNDERGONE 
ARTHRISCOPIC KNEE SURGERY ONLY SIX WEEKS BEFORE WINNING THE GYMNASTICS 
ALL-AROUND GOLD MEDAL IN THE '84 OLYMPICS.

<P>
 Ten years ago, a spunky sprite with a 1,000-watt smile and a girl-next-door 
name, Mary Lou Retton, vaulted from the Los Angeles Olympics across television 
screens into the homes of millions of Americans who fell in love with her. 
</P>
<P>
 Sweet 16, 4-feet-9, a red-white-and-blue, stars-and-stripes ball spinning 
through the air, she made an entire country cheer on Aug. 3, 1984, when she 
landed firmly on her feet and flung up her arms, absolutely sure of a perfect 
10 that gave her the first U.S. gold ever in women's gymnastics. 
</P>
<P>
 She symbolized all the joy and self-congratulatory nationalism of those 
Olympic Games, boycotted by most of the Soviet bloc. The gymnastics giants of 
Romania showed up, and Retton, the West Virginia-born student of Romanian 
defector Bela Karolyi, beat their best for the prestigious all-around title in 
the Summer Games' most glamorous event. 
</P>
<P>
 "People would say, 'Thank you, you did so much for America,"' Retton recalled 
as she prepared to celebrate the anniversary of her triumph. "I guess America 
had a need for something to come out of those '84 Games. It wasn't only me. 
There were a lot of great stars. Those were America's Games." 
</P>
<P>
 Those were the Olympics of Carl Lewis and Evelyn Ashford and Greg Louganis, 
but it was Mary Lou Retton's face on Wheaties boxes, a drop of milk so cute on 
her lip in the commercials, and her smile on all the magazine covers. 
</P>
<P>
 These days, Retton feels responsible in part for a change in attitude by 
budding gymnasts and their parents and coaches, many of them consumed by a 
greedy chase for gold to cash in on the rewards it can bring. Christy Henrich, 
who died recently at 22 from a long battle with anorexia nervosa and bulimia, 
is only the latest gymnastics victim of eating disorders in pursuit of a 
perfectly tiny body to go with perfect scores. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kids have agents now before they even make it into the teens," Retton said. 
"If someone would have asked me when I was that age if you have an agent, I 
would have said, 'What, a travel agent?' I didn't know what an agent was. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really don't have an answer to that question (about eating disorders) 
because it never affected me. We weren't on strict diets. We were all told to 
eat balanced meals. And Bela would say, 'Don't eat the cookies and candy 
bars."' 
</P>
<P>
 Karolyi, joining her on a visit back to the city of their greatest success 
together, claimed Retton's generation didn't even know about eating disorders. 
His protest may be somewhat disingenuous, considering that several other girls 
he coached, including Nadia Comaneci, suffered from eating problems. But 
Karolyi is probably correct that the problem has gotten worse because of what 
he called "a desperate run for the money" since Retton competed. 
</P>
<P>
 "They did not have that pressure of the family chasing them desperately toward 
the gold, be the best, the gold, the gold," Karolyi said. "They had no pressure 
from the hype, the media. Nobody hanging on. Nobody knew in 1983 Mary Lou would 
be one of the most visible personalities during the 1984 Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's responsible for everybody chasing the ultimate dream. But for her it 
was the natural joy of being in that sport. She was crying, she was laughing, 
she was a joy. Today, you don't see that. Now you have these girls with their 
frozen fish faces. My heart is breaking because that is not the sport. They 
should enjoy it, damn it, enjoy it. The ones who have been pushing are the 
parents. The damn parents are the ones who are torturing them." 
</P>
<P>
 Retton nodded in agreement, "It's true, it's true." 
</P>
<P>
 Retton hardly went into the Olympics obsessed with making money. No American 
gymnast had ever gotten rich off the Games. When she won the gold, she asked 
Karolyi if that meant she could buy new underwear because all six pairs she 
owned had holes in them. 
</P>
<P>
 "People were so grateful for Mary Lou because she represented the innocent 
type, what all Americans are looking after," Karolyi said, sitting beside her 
as they recalled those dizzying days a decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
 She's no bigger now at 26, the smile hasn't dimmed a single watt and her 
popularity hasn't waned. She married former Texas football player Shannon 
Kelley in 1990 and hopes to have a houseful of children someday. The rounded, 
baby-fat features of her teen-age years have yielded to the trim, chiseled look 
of a woman who still works out daily. 
</P>
<P>
 Her flips and somersaults are limited, though, to exhibitions and cameo acting 
appearances between motivational speeches for business people and school kids. 
In essence, she tells them what she said when she won: "Well, nobody thought it 
could be done. But you know what? I went and did it." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Little did the world know, as she landed her two final faultless vaults, that 
she had cried so much only six weeks earlier when cartilage cracked in her 
right knee, locking it stiff, and a doctor told her she must have surgery and 
might miss the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
 She kept it a secret then and has never talked about it publicly until now. 
</P>
<P>
 She was with teammate Julianne McNamara and Karolyi at a camp he was 
conducting in Louisville and had just finished an exhibition. Retton's knee had 
been hurting all year, but she figured it was "a little crick" that would go 
away. 
</P>
<P>
 "I sat down Indian style at the end of the floor exercise mat and the little 
girls wanted some autographs, and 20, 25 minutes passed, and I went to stand up 
and I couldn't," Retton recalled, wincing once again at the memory. "My knee 
was actually locked crooked. I hobbled up to Bela and tapped him on the hip and 
I said, 'Bela, I can't straighten my knee.' His eyes kind of crossed and he 
said, 'You're crazy." 
</P>
<P>
 "I said, 'Kick it, kick it,"' Karolyi said. 
</P>
<P>
 He helped her back to the hotel, trying to conceal his worries from her, and 
told her to sleep with ice on the knee. 
</P>
<P>
 "But in the morning my knee was the size of a balloon," Retton said. "He took 
me to the emergency room and the doctor was examining me and he just looked up 
and matter of fact said, 'We'll have to do surgery.' 
</P>
<P>
 "Bela and I and my parents looked at each other and said, 'Surgery?' We had 
just gotten back from the Olympic trials. I placed first place. I'm going to 
the Olympics, which were six weeks away, and I have to have surgery? Ohhh, my 
goodness. He explained it was just a piece of cartilage that had broken off 
over the years. Yeah, just a minor piece of cartilage." 
</P>
<P>
 Karolyi wasn't about to let just anyone cut into that golden knee. 
</P>
<P>
 "I started to run desperately to find somebody who I could trust," he said, 
telling Retton now, for the first time, about his panic. "That fellow over 
there, I wanted to kill him, the one who put pressure on your knee and you were 
crying. I said, 'God, get your hands off her.' He was twisting. My heart was 
hurting. It was just a local orthopedi-idiot. 
</P>
<P>
 "At that moment, you see everything ruined. That is a desperate moment." 
</P>
<P>
 Karolyi arranged to have a top orthopedic surgeon, Dr. Richard Caspari in 
Richmond, Va., perform the relatively new procedure of arthroscopic surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember him," Karolyi said, "because ever since I am blessing his name." 
</P>
<P>
 Retton left camp the next day, and at 5 a.m. the following morning she was 
already under the scope. That day they flew back to Houston, and she was in the 
gym practicing again the day afterward. 
</P>
<P>
 "People who knew said, 'You are both of you crazy, you are nuts,"' Karolyi 
said. But he wanted everything to seem normal. No one outside the small group 
in the gym and Retton's family knew of the surgery, and it would remain a 
secret throughout the Games. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to get back in the gym, shut up and don't tell to anybody and don't 
create a panic and create the rumors because that goes against you," he said. 
"As soon as you're telling anyone, you're just cutting your own throat. Judges 
are underscoring you and your supporters stop having faith in you." 
</P>
<P>
 Retton rode the exercise bike hard, swam and jogged in the pool of the family 
she lived with, and stayed away from tumbling and landing until she got 
clearance from her doctor. 
</P>
<P>
 "We did three months of rehabilitation in two weeks," she said. "In 
gymnastics, we're vaulting, we're 10 and 11 feet up in the air, we're coming 
down on our legs. I mean, to get back into that kind of shape that fast is just 
unheard of. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I remember when the doctor gave me the release, saying 'Let's land on it, 
let's see if this knee is going to hold up.' It was a vault with a front hand 
spring and, aiiii, I landed it." 
</P>
<P>
 Karolyi was right under her, ready to grab her if she got hurt. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whooo, she flowed through that board, we don't worry," he said. "That was the 
ultimate proof. The knee holds up. At that moment we're going to fight against 
the clock because there was only three weeks to go. And we knew very well you 
can't count the last week because that's just the nightmare of the last 
arrangement, and public workouts where nobody can see any kind of weakness in 
you. Nobody can sense you are in difficulty." 
</P>
<P>
 The only real problem at the Olympics was that Karolyi couldn't coach Retton 
during competition. Don Peters, the U.S. coach, didn't want Karolyi around, 
didn't want to yield any power or publicity to a rival coach, and didn't trust 
the transplanted Transylvanian who had defected just a few years before. 
Karolyi got onto the floor at UCLA's Pauley Pavilion only by obtaining a 
credential as an equipment adjuster for AMF, though he never adjusted anything. 
Instead he skulked around behind the barriers, communicating with Retton via 
hand signals and facial expressions. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was constantly searching for him," Retton said. "I was like, 'Where is he, 
where is he?' And he's like an animal, he's everywhere, you can't ever catch up 
with him. He's popping up and down. But, by God, he was there every time it was 
my turn to go up. Every time I would get the green light from the judge, I had 
to find him and get that last glimpse of his pumping fist or that nod. And if 
Bela said you're ready, you're ready. Yeah, I needed that. I don't know if it 
was a security reason, because I was prepared physically. But when you're at 
the Olympics, it's all a mental game." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The all-around came down to the last event, Romania's implacable, 17-year-old 
Ecaterina Szabo leading Retton 69.225 to 69.175. Retton would need perfection 
on the vault, Szabo anything less than that on the uneven bars. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bela always taught us not to look at opponents because you can't do anything 
about it, just let them do their own and you do yourself, but yeah, I was 
watching her bar routine," Retton said. "The bar was her weakest, the vault was 
my best. She did a clean routine, no big breaks. But she had one big step in 
the dismount that they had to take off a tenth, and that's when Bela went 
'Ohhh-Kayyy,' really loud and that's when it started. That's when he came over. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've watched the tape all the time because I show it before my motivational 
presentation, and Bela is making me a nervous wreck. He's talking constantly, 
'Now or never, this is it, you've got it, I want to see you now, see what you 
can do.' God, he knew me so well, because I work so much better under pressure. 
If I've gotta do it, I'm gonna do it, and he knew that. So he's feeding me and 
he said, 'That's it, let's do it, now or never."' 
</P>
<P>
 Retton got the green light and took her position down the runway without 
betraying any nervousness. Karolyi's heart was thumping. 
</P>
<P>
 "He told me to go flat onto the horse, which would give me the height to go 
up, and I knew I had it when I was in the air and I was doing the twist and I 
opened up," she said. "I could always tell if I'm going to get the landing or 
not, and I knew. So, y'all didn't see it, but I was smiling in the air. 
</P>
<P>
 "And when I landed, the noise went up and Bela jumped over the fence and 
Pauley Pavilion was going nuts. And it seemed like an hour before they flashed 
the score of 10 and, yeah, I had stuck it. I had scored 10s on my vault many 
times in other competitions. So I knew I was capable of doing it. But they 
still had to flash the score. And it seemed like an eternity." 
</P>
<P>
 Retton could have walked away on air at that point, gold in hand, the way Carl 
Lewis did without taking another shot at 30 feet in the long jump. But that 
wasn't the way Retton or Karolyi wanted to go out. 
</P>
<P>
 "I mean, it was the Olympics, I'd been through so much to get there, I said, 
'By God, let's do it again."' 
</P>
<P>
 "That was more prestigious to me, the second vault, than even the first," 
Karolyi said. "Usually the second vault is a better vault. If you are doing a 
vault which is questionable, you are capable to do a second vault a little 
better because you are experienced with the landing, you're a little more 
adjusted with that one and the second vault is a routine vault. But, prior to 
this performance, I never in 35 years seen one gymnast managed to do a second 
perfect vault after a perfect vault, or the vault which made her a winner. 
Y'know, there's totally a mental drop -- 'The world is mine, I don't care.' 
That's what we always fought against. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now, I tell her, 'You care till then because that's the pure sport, that's 
what you love, let's honor yourself, do it for everybody who loves, do it one 
more time. And that exactly came out." 
</P>
<P>
 One perfect 10 for gold, another for love. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's exactly right," Retton said. "In honor of the sport, and how much we 
had been through just in those past five weeks to get there, and I'm going to 
do it all. And that's something he totally instilled in all his students: You 
fight until the end." 
</P>
<P>
 And even as the 10 flashed again and cheers erupted and the cameras clicked 
around her, she still couldn't quite believe it was all real. 
</P>
<P>
 "I slept with my medal under my bed that night," Retton said. "The first thing 
when I got up in the morning I checked to see if it wasn't a dream."

GOLF / THOMAS BONK; PGA CHAMPIONSHIP IS PLOT-LADEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS BONK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The 76th PGA Championship begins Thursday in the summer heat at Southern Hills 
Country Club in Tulsa, complete with better-than-usual plot lines. 
</P>
<P>
 They are, in no particular order, how will Paul Azinger play in his return, 
how will Arnold Palmer say farewell and how long will it take for the Oklahoma 
sun to melt a 7-iron? 
</P>
<P>
 Azinger, the defending champion, will be playing in his second tournament 
since being treated for the lymphoma in his shoulder diagnosed more than eight 
months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Azinger made his comeback in the Buick Open, which ends today -- a strategy 
that enabled him to get in some golf before defending his title and also remove 
some of the media attention from him this week. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Buick Open, Azinger saved his energy by limiting his practice. He hit 
enough balls to warm up and then iced his shoulder afterward. 
</P>
<P>
 Palmer is playing in his last PGA. Although it may not be as fond a goodby as 
his experience at the Open, Palmer lists the PGA as one of his favorite events, 
even though he never won it. 
</P>
<P>
 In 36 years, Palmer's best results in the PGA have been ties for second in 
1964, '68 and '70. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the 76th PGA Championship hasn't begun, preparations for the 77th are 
well under way. 
</P>
<P>
 Next year's tournament will be held Aug. 7-13 at Riviera, which last staged 
the event in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
 To get ready, Riviera has spent more than $1.2 million on rebuilding the 
greens, planting new bent grass, recontouring the greenside bunkers and 
rebuilding tees. 
</P>
<P>
 Ben Crenshaw supervised the major greens work that not only included the new 
grass, but basically returned the greens to their original size in 1926, when 
architect George C. Thomas' work was completed. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 New old friend: Nick Faldo will bring a new putter to the PGA Championship. 
Better make that a new, old putter. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Buick Open, he re-debuted a putter he last used in 1990. It may be a 
good idea. 
</P>
<P>
 Faldo has two top-10 finishes in eight PGA Tour events this year, and his 
record in the majors is sort of minor -- he finished 32nd at the Masters, 
missed the cut at the U.S. Open, tied for 8th at the British Open. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Pick 'em: For what it's worth, Golf Digest has established Nick Price as the 
favorite to win the PGA Championship. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Good team, man: Greg Norman and Nick Price will play as a team in the sixth 
Franklin Funds Shark Shootout Nov. 15-20 at Sherwood Country Club. 
</P>
<P>
 The $1.1-million event also includes Curtis Strange in a field of 20. It 
benefits children's charities, including the National Childhood Cancer 
Foundation and Casa Pacifica. 
</P>
<P>
 Details: (805) 379-2664. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Alternate plan: Dicky Pride, who won the Federal Express St. Jude tournament 
last week, was an alternate who wouldn't have gotten into the tournament field 
if not for Lee Janzen's withdrawal. 
</P>
<P>
 Pride had missed the cut in 12 of his previous 17 tournaments, before his 
eighth place three weeks ago in the Deposit Guaranty. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Senor Senior: Put this in your calculator and smoke it: Lee Trevino has won 
nearly $1.1 million in seven months on the Senior PGA Tour. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1968, or more than 26 years, Trevino has won $3.47 million on the 
regular PGA Tour. 
</P>
<P>
 Obviously, it pays to get old, but only if you play golf. 
</P>

 Helen wheels: Helen Alfredsson, who appeared to have the U.S. Women's Open in 
her golf bag until the wheels fell off in the last round, was so distraught 
that she . . . won the LPGA Pinch-Welch's Championship last week, which means 
she has finished in the top 11 in her last six tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
 Alfredsson, whose closing-round 77 cost her the U.S. Open, withstood a late 
charge by Pat Bradley to win the LPGA event at Canton, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
 Bradley came away impressed by the Swedish golfer. Said Bradley: "She did not 
crack." Golf Notes

 Defending champion Jill McGill, 22, of Denver is one of three former champions 
who will play in the U.S. Women's Amateur beginning Monday at The Homestead in 
Hot Springs, Va. The other champions are 1973 winner Carol Semple Thompson of 
Sewickley, Pa., and 1958, '61 and '63 winner Anne Sander of Santa Barbara. . . 
. Defending champion John Harris of Edina, Minn., and 1991 champion Mitch Voges 
of Simi Valley are among 12 golfers exempt from qualifying for the U.S. Amateur 
Championship, which will be played Aug. 22-28 at the TPC at Sawgrass at Ponte 
Vedra Beach, Fla.

 Gil Gerard is the celebrity host for the City of Hope Invitational Celebrity 
Golf-A-Thon, on Aug. 29 at Braemar Country Club. . . . Clint Eastwood, chairman 
of the board of the Monterey Peninsula Golf Foundation, announced that the 1994 
AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am raised $1.5 million for charity. . . . Inner-city

VENTURA SYMPHONY GETS ITS DUCKS IN A ROW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE FIELDS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was 15 minutes past race time and 5-year-old Peter Pommer was growing 
antsy. 
</P>
<P>
 Pressing his body against the chain-link fence, he kicked dusty gravel into 
the Freeman Diversion Dam's channel and eyed the starting line down the way. 
</P>
<P>
 "When that big truck dumps the ducks, they're going to zoom fast," he said. "I 
want my duck to win!" 
</P>
<P>
 Suddenly, the countdown began, a trumpet sounded and the truck's bed began to 
lift. In slow motion, nearly 10,000 yellow rubber ducks toppled into the 
algae-green water and began bobbing downstream. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mine's the first!" Peter cried, pointing to the lead duck, listing slightly 
to its side. "If it wins, I want to play with it in the bathtub because ducks 
go in the bathtub, except the kind with fur." 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, an estimated 500 people turned out for the Ventura County 
Symphony's rubber duck race, a fund-raiser that had been delayed for about a 
month because it initially ran afoul of the law. 
</P>
<P>
 Under cloudless skies, young children, their parents and others lined the 
3,000-foot concrete drainage channel alongside the Santa Clara River near 
Saticoy to watch the floating carpet of ducks inch down the channel. 
</P>
<P>
 Sponsors paid $5 apiece to adopt ducks, which were marked with numbers and 
plucked from the channel in the order of their finish.  
</P>
<P>
 To move the ducks along, officials with the United Water Conservation 
District, which owns the Freeman Diversion Dam, increased the channel's water 
flow for about half an hour.  
</P>
<P>
 The lucky ducks that finished first won their sponsors a variety of prizes, 
ranging from a bolo tie to a three-day cruise to Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 The top prize, a 1994 blue Geo Metro donated by Paradise Chevrolet, went to 
free-lance photographer Spencer Weiner, 28, of Santa Barbara. Weiner 
photographed the event for The Times and plunked down $15 for three ducks 
shortly before the race began. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't believe it," he said. "I never win anything. The last thing I won was 
movie tickets, but I couldn't go because my 1-year-old was too fussy for a 
baby-sitter." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Symphony officials said they raised about $23,000 from the event, and expected 
to net about $5,000 after paying off expenses for the race. A total of 4,600 
ducks were sponsored while another 300 were given away for free. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we break even we're happy, and if we make money we're really happy," said 
Karine Beesley, the symphony's executive director. 
</P>
<P>
 Faced with an $80,000 deficit this year, symphony officials saw the duck race 
as a way of expanding their audience beyond season ticket-holders and raising 
much-needed cash. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, the symphony has hosted more traditional fund-raisers such as 
golf tournaments, gala dinners and footraces. 
</P>
<P>
 The rubber duck race appealed more to young families, Beesley said, because 
for $5 they could have a stake in the race. In contrast, tickets to gala 
dinners can run $250 a plate. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 John Conlan and his wife, Patty, said they have never attended a symphony 
performance. But after hearing about the duck race in the newspaper, they 
decided to bring their three daughters out for the day. 
</P>
<P>
 Initially planned for June, symphony officials postponed the race when the 
district attorney's office warned that the race was being promoted illegally as 
a lottery. To meet state law, symphony officials had to give the public a 
chance to win prizes without a donation. 
</P>
<P>
 And, in the end, only 300 people entered a duck in the race for free. 
</P>
<P>
 Lining the canal two and three people deep, some participants took their role 
as race sponsors more seriously than others. 
</P>
<P>
 Twelve-year-old Colin Wilson of Fillmore and his stepbrother, 9-year-old Scott 
Haviland, had hoisted a banner in the air declaring, "Go Rubber Ducky 33706." 
</P>
<P>
 "In big races, they have signs that say, 'Go so and so,' " Colin explained. 
"It's just like that." 
</P>
<P>
 Even if theirs didn't win, the brothers had no intention of leaving 
empty-handed. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're buying our own rubber ducks to put in the pool at home," Scott said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The day's only snag came as the luckiest ducks neared the finish line. But 
instead of easing neatly into the winner's chute, the ducks jammed the opening 
and none could get in. 
</P>
<P>
 "Things are not as ducky as they seem," quipped Glenn Wilson of Fillmore. 
</P>
<P>
 An official with the Freeman Diversion Dam came to the rescue. Balancing 
himself in a rowboat, he hand-plucked the winning ducks from the water. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Kentosh, operations manager of the dam, said the winner's chute didn't 
arrive until late last week. "We never had a chance to test it with many 
ducks," he said, "so this was sort of a dry run for us."

TASK FORCE ACCELERATES DRIVE TO KEEP BASE OPEN; POINT MUGU: GROUP MOUNTS MAJOR 
LOBBYING EFFORT. NAVY DOWNPLAYS REPORT THAT EGLIN AIR FORCE BASE IS MAIN 
COMPETITION. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Fearing the loss of the Ventura County's largest Navy base and its $1-billion 
contribution to the economy, business and civic leaders have stepped up a major 
lobbying effort aimed at saving the base from closure. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent weeks, members of the Ventura County BRAC '95 Task Force have stated 
that the Point Mugu Naval Air Weapons Station could be closed given a race 
between the Navy base and giant Eglin Air Force Base, near Pensacola, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 But Navy officials this week downplayed the notion that Point Mugu is in 
direct competition with just the sprawling Florida facility. They said instead 
that they are in competition with as many as 20 other military test and 
evaluation facilities scattered across the nation operated by the Air Force, 
Navy and Army. 
</P>
<P>
 "I appreciate their concern and I understand their anxiety, but it's 
unfortunate they are getting so spun-up over this (issue)," said Rear Adm. Dana 
B. McKinney, commander at Point Mugu and its sister base at China Lake. "The 
belief that it's either Eglin or Point Mugu is something that cannot be 
supported by any data that we know." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 While Point Mugu is smaller than the Florida facility, its 36,000-square-mile 
sea test range is considered unique because of its extensive radar tracking 
systems and other instruments that can monitor any type of weapon system. 
</P>
<P>
 Point Mugu's ability to use its missile launching and tracking facility at San 
Nicolas Island also adds to its ability to fully test and evaluate weapons 
systems, Navy officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials say that while Eglin's sea test range is physically larger, at 
86,500-square miles, its ocean range is limited to the testing of certain 
weapons because of the heavy commercial airline traffic and the base's 
proximity to Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense Department officials also point out that Naval Air Station, Patuxent 
River, Md., would also come under scrutiny during any review for redundant 
functions. The Patuxent River Navy base operates its own 51,000-square-mile sea 
test range at the foot of the Chesapeake Bay. It too is used for aircraft and 
weapons testing. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, Sen. Dianne Feinstein proposed joining Point Mugu with seven other 
military weapons testing sites and placing them under one centralized Western 
command. Her safety-in-numbers proposal, she said, "would help prevent future 
base closures in California and expand operations at the Southwest bases, thus 
creating new jobs." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Leaders of the BRAC '95 Task Force acknowledge that comparisons between Eglin 
and Point Mugu may help area residents understand the facilities are vulnerable 
to closure. But they deny they are attempting to instigate a fight between the 
two military communities. 
</P>
<P>
 "The notion that we are in a battle with Eglin is something the press has 
grabbed ahold of for their own purposes," said Cal Carrera, chairman of the 
BRAC '95 Task Force. "Our goals are to show the military value of the two bases 
in Ventura County." 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, Carrera said that he and leaders of the task force believe that 
Eglin is Point Mugu's main competitor but do not discount threats presented by 
the Patuxent River facility and other military test and evaluation facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Carrera added that the task force is also concerned about the possible closure 
of the Construction Battalion Center in Port Hueneme -- the West Coast home of 
the Navy's Seabees. 
</P>
<P>
 "With Point Mugu, there are some very identifiable threats, like Eglin," 
Carrera said. "The threats to Port Hueneme, on the other hand, are harder to 
identify because of the scope of the work it does and because there are so many 
tenant commands there." 
</P>
<P>
 Navy officials say that Port Hueneme is the only major Seabee base on the West 
Coast and is used to serve the entire Pacific Fleet. Its counterpart base is 
located in Gulf Port, Miss. Capt. James Delker, Port Hueneme's commanding 
officer, could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Carrera said the task force, a group sponsored by the Ventura County Economic 
Development Assn. and the Defense Services Industry Executive Assn., has been 
offering a series of public presentations on the base closure process and the 
possible closure of Port Hueneme or Point Mugu. He said the group, formally 
organized June 29, has already briefed the Ventura County Board of Supervisors 
and the members of several city councils. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Although the task force has markedly stepped up its public briefings, Carrera 
said that the goal is not to stir a panic within the county. 
</P>
<P>
 "The task force is composed of a lot of engineers," Carrera said. "We're 
largely incapable of being hysterical. The last thing we want to do is to 
create hysteria. What we do want to do is to educate them about the realities 
of the base closure process." 
</P>
<P>
 Part of that effort will be to raise $350,000 to pay for the services of a 
Washington firm to do lobbying and statistical analysis on behalf of the bases. 
So far, the group has raised about $10,000 in donations but is expecting more 
soon, Carrera said. 
</P>
<P>
 Larry Taub, a lobbyist for Thicksten, Grimm and Burgum in Washington -- the 
firm that is currently negotiating with the task force -- said that in 
anticipation of a contract, members of his staff are already researching the 
bases and assembling a defense for them if needed. 
</P>
<P>
 Taub would not reveal his lobbying strategy but did say the best defense is 
making sure that a military base never gets on the Defense Department list 
transmitted to the base closure commission. He said those facilities on the 
list have a 90% chance of being shut down later by the commission. 
</P>
<P>
 "The clock is ticking with the base closure process," Taub said. "I have my 
staff starting to do some research -- looking at the bases' vulnerabilities and 
their assets." 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Mendonca, Point Mugu's deputy program manager for base realignment and 
closure, said for the first time officials are looking across the services to 
weed out redundancies. Weapons testing and evaluation is one of six areas that 
will be closely examined, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Point Mugu officials said that the first phase of the base closure process had 
already been completed when they forwarded the secretary of the Navy more than 
3,000 pages of documents in what is known as a "data call." The documents -- a 
stack measuring 3 feet high -- detail virtually all of Point Mugu's operations 
and are used by Defense Department officials and the commission to make their 
decisions. Virtually all U.S. military installations had to answer the "data 
call." 
</P>
<P>
 The members of the base closure commission will be appointed by President 
Clinton in January and the Defense Department will hand the commission its 
recommended list for closure in March. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, the commission will hold a series of public hearings and make its final 
determination in July. At that point, Clinton has 15 days to sign the list or 
reject it in whole. 
</P>
<P>
 And Congress has 45 days to muster the votes to reject the entire list of 
bases to be closed, but cannot pick and chose among various bases. If the 
deadline passes, the closure list automatically becomes law.

BANK'S DEMISE OPPORTUNITY FOR COMPETITORS; FINANCE: TAKEOVER OF BANK OF A. LEVY 
IS LAMENTED BY OTHER SMALL INSTITUTIONS. BUT THEY'LL ACT QUICKLY TO ATTRACT 
FORMER CUSTOMERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 They watched in disbelief last week as the granddaddy of them all, the 
venerable Bank of A. Levy, bowed to the pressures of the times and sold out to 
corporate banking giant First Interstate. 
</P>
<P>
 By far the biggest locally owned, independent bank in Ventura County, with 17 
branches and assets of $625 million, it seemed to them that the Bank of A. Levy 
would be the last of the community banks to take down its signs. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the county's nine remaining local banks -- some so small they have only 
one branch -- are re-evaluating their own positions. 
</P>
<P>
 Their conclusion: The disappearance of Bank of A. Levy is a sad moment for the 
county -- and a wide-open opportunity for them. 
</P>
<P>
 There are customers to be snatched up, the kind of customers who run 
community-based businesses and place faith in neighborhood banks that share 
their hometown loyalty. 
</P>
<P>
 These are the kind of customers who want their loan application processed in 
Thousand Oaks or Camarillo, not in San Francisco or Los Angeles -- the type of 
small-business owners who have used Bank of A. Levy for decades. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are going to try to fill that void," said Stan Cohen, chairman of the 
board at Channel Islands National Bank, which has begun an aggressive 
advertising campaign to draw customers from the Bank of A. Levy. 
</P>
<P>
 He predicted that the county's newspapers "will be carrying quite a few other 
advertisements in the next few days." 
</P>
<P>
 Putting an advertisement together was easy: Channel Islands already had one on 
hand, leftover from the 1992 purchase of Security Pacific by Bank of America. 
Change a few lines, and it's ready for the latest takeover. 
</P>
<P>
 But local bank officials said they don't expect to see much more of that for 
awhile, if only because the remaining local banks are so much smaller than Bank 
of A. Levy. 
</P>
<P>
 Buying one of the remaining banks would not allow a major chain to 
dramatically increase its presence in the county -- one of First Interstate's 
stated goals in buying up Bank of A. Levy. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Cupp, president of Ventura County National Bank, said his institution 
plans to aggressively pursue Bank of A. Levy's customers. VCNB will become the 
county's largest locally owned bank when First Interstate's $86-million 
takeover of Bank of A. Levy is completed early next year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We consider First Interstate's acquisition to be a tremendous opportunity for 
this bank," Cupp said. "We expect to increase our market share." 
</P>
<P>
 VCNB, which spent much of the past year under close scrutiny by federal 
regulators for its management of bad loans, said as recently as last month that 
it also was talking with a potential merger partner. But Cupp said the bank is 
no longer pursuing that option, at least not now. 
</P>
<P>
 For good reason, said David Meadows, an analyst with SNL Securities in 
Charlottesville, Va., who follows VCNB. 
</P>
<P>
 "With A. Levy getting ready to take off, they are in a good position," Meadows 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cupp and his counterparts at the county's other small banks say they do not 
fear competition from Bank of A. Levy's replacement. In fact, most said they 
feel less threatened by First Interstate, which has 1,093 branches sprawling 
across the 13 Western states. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 While the president and chief executive of Ojai Valley Bank, John Reynolds, 
said he will be sad to see the Ventura County stalwart down the street from his 
office disappear, he admits it might be good for his business. 
</P>
<P>
 "Actually, competition would be tougher dealing with them than with First 
Interstate," Reynolds said. "Bigger banks are easier competition." 
</P>
<P>
 Reynolds said the Ojai bank, founded in 1973, has deliberately established a 
niche for itself that would not even pique the interest of giants like First 
Interstate. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're the leading construction lenders in the valley," Reynolds said. 
"Primarily to customers building homes. And there simply are not too many 
financial institutions interested in construction lending." 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley Bank, with four offices in Simi Valley, has carved its own niche, 
catering mostly to small and medium-sized local businesses, but also serving 
one major customer: the city of Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 General Services Director John McMillan said the city moved its accounts from 
First Interstate to Simi Valley Bank about 10 years ago. The city's payroll of 
$1.5 million to $2 million a month is processed through the bank, as well as 
city fees from the sewer and water districts. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the primary benefits is that the money stays with the local 
community," McMillan said. "But it turns out that the services that they 
provide and their fees are considerably lower than some of the bigger players." 
</P>
<P>
 When the city was first negotiating with Simi Valley Bank, McMillan noted that 
it was the only one willing to count the change from the city transit system's 
fare boxes free of charge. 
</P>
<P>
 Janice France, Simi Valley Bank's chief financial officer, said she expects 
the bank to pick up deposits from former Bank of A. Levy customers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We found that when the First State Bank of the Oaks was sold to First 
Interstate (in January), our deposit rate growth was tremendous," France said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 While customers value name recognition when they drop by the local bank to 
cash a check, community-based bank officials said they believe their customers 
prize the accessibility of loan officers even more. 
</P>
<P>
 "There aren't a lot of channels to go through," said Douglas Shearer, 
president and chief executive of Camarillo Community Bank. "You want a 
decision? It's easy. All that is done right here." 
</P>
<P>
 David Zarraonandia, a Simi Valley businessman who with his family runs Pre-Con 
Products, a manufacturer of concrete construction products, said he banks with 
Los Robles National Bank for just that reason. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can walk right into the president's office and sit down and he'll talk to 
me," Zarraonandia said. "Last week we got a $25,000 loan on one afternoon's 
notice. We're not even that big of a customer, but they know our business." 
</P>
<P>
 He said his family used to do all their banking with Bank of America, but 
decided the service was too impersonal and moved most of their business. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the bigger banks, the person that you're talking to doesn't have the 
authority to really do anything," he said. "I think it's easier for a loan 
officer to say, 'Sorry, downtown didn't approve it.' " 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But Pre-Con Products still uses Bank of America for payroll, because its many 
branches offer more convenience for their employees. Los Robles has only one 
branch. 
</P>
<P>
 As long as there are local businesses, there will be local banks, said Joseph 
Nesbitt, president of what will be the county's oldest locally owned bank once 
Bank of A. Levy is gone: Citizens State Bank, with branches in Santa Paula and 
Fillmore. A third branch, in Piru, has been closed since the Jan. 17 
earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is always a need for a community bank," Nesbitt said. "There has to be 
an alternative to chain banks. We can't compete on the big loans; we don't even 
try. But customers will come for the extra service we offer." 
</P>
<P>
 The hunt for those service-seeking Bank of A. Levy customers is already 
beginning. David Bouchet, senior vice president at Ventura-based American 
Commercial Bank, said the bank will begin advertising within a few weeks in 
hopes of wooing some of those customers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't like saying, 'Ha, ha, you're dead,' " Bouchet said. "But we will 
definitely be doing a lot of advertising." Locally Owned Banks * American

VALLEY BRIEFING: GRANADA HILLS: A QUAKE-WRACKED COMMUNITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For many residents, Granada Hills is simply home. Home to the first post 
office in the Valley, (Lopez Station in 1869), home to the Valley's first oil 
well (1916) and home of the Cagney Ranch, where America's favorite screen 
gangster once lived and Gene Autry used to film the cowboy dream. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Northridge earthquake has had a devastating effect. Transportation, 
education and medical facilities remain crippled, and condemned buildings have 
left some neighborhoods half empty and transformed two into official "ghost 
towns." Now neighbors are relying on a strong sense of community and history to 
rebuild. History 
</P>
<P>
 Created on land divided by Charles Maclay and George K. Porter in 1881, the 
area was first known as the Sunshine Ranch -- a hodgepodge of orange groves and 
chicken and rabbit ranches. In 1927, a contest was held to officially name the 
community, and the name Granada was chosen because of the likeness to the city 
in Spain. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hills" was added to the name in 1942, and during the next several decades, 
the area grew in halves, divided by Rinaldi Street. Above Rinaldi are sprawling 
homes, equestrian ranches, the 18-hole golf course on the Knollwood Country 
Club, the Odyssey Restaurant and the Van Norman Dam, now drained and 
transformed into a wildlife sanctuary. Below Rinaldi is a mixture of commercial 
centers, shopping malls, apartments and homes. Community Issues 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now, there are only two things going on in Granada Hills: the Sunshine 
Canyon dump and the earthquake recovery,"  
</P>
<P>
 Greig Smith, a Granada Hills resident who lost his home in the earthquake and 
works on the landfill issue as chief deputy for Los Angeles City Councilman Hal 
Bernson. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunshine Canyon 
</P>
<P>
 Opened in 1954, this dump north of Granada Hills has been the target of 
controversy since 1984, when Browning-Ferris Industries proposed to expand the 
landfill's capacity to 17 million tons in an environmentally sensitive oak 
woodland. Although the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors approved the 
expansion last November, opponents have sought to block the plan with lawsuits 
and in June, a judge has issued a restraining order against BFI after the 
company felled 1,800 oak trees. Meanwhile, the city of Los Angeles is currently 
in negotiations with the company on a settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 Earthquake Recovery 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the community is on the rebound, from repaired homes to reopened 
shopping centers. But many symbols of the Jan. 17 temblor remain. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Gogh Street School: The only public school still closed because of the 
temblor, Van Gogh Street School will be razed, then rebuilt within three years 
at a cost of $5 million. Geologic reports indicate that the location suffers 
from an unstable soil condition that would not support the structures during 
another strong earthquake. The Los Angeles school district will apply to FEMA 
for funds to level the existing school and construct a new one. Meanwhile, the 
350 students are being educated in nearby Frost Junior High. 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley Freeway: California Department of Transportation workers have 
demolished and are replacing two quake-damaged bridges, the 700-foot 
Mission/Gothic bridge and the 400-foot bridge over the Bull Creek Canyon flood 
control channel. The $12 million project, which has squeezed the five-lane 
freeway into three lanes, was expected to be finished by Sept. 3, but Caltrans 
engineer Frank Latham said the project could be delayed an additional two weeks 
because of permit difficulties. And because the increased traffic flow is 
already over capacity, Caltrans has opted not to reopen several on-ramps until 
the project is completed. 
</P>
<P>
 Kaiser Permanente building: One of the most striking symbols of the Northridge 
earthquake, the gutted Kaiser Permanente office building and medical center on 
Balboa Boulevard, is no more. And, according to HMO's officials, it will never 
be back. The demolition of the five-story office building in February has sent 
91 employees and physicians to other medical complexes in Woodland Hills and 
Panorama City. Community Profile

<P>
 A 38-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of fatally stabbing his 
roommate with a kitchen knife during a drunken argument at a home in Nyeland 
Acres, authorities said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Miguel Garabaldi initially fled the scene of Friday night's stabbing, but he 
returned a short time later and was taken into custody, said Sheriff's Sgt. 
Mike Barnes. 
</P>
<P>
 Garabaldi was booked into Ventura County Jail on suspicion of homicide and was 
being held in lieu of $250,000 bail, Barnes said. 
</P>
<P>
 The victim, whose identity is being withheld pending notification of 
relatives, was pronounced dead from a single stab wound to the abdomen after 
arriving at St. John's Regional Medical Center, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The slaying occurred about 10:15 p.m. inside a residence at 3584 Orange Drive 
in Nyeland Acres, an unincorporated area of the county just north of Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the Sheriff's Department, Garabaldi, the victim and two 
acquaintances were inside the house drinking alcohol, watching TV and listening 
to music when Garabaldi and the victim began arguing. During the fight, 
Garabaldi allegedly grabbed a kitchen knife and stabbed his roommate, 
authorities said. The knife was found at the scene. 
</P>
<P>
 Garabaldi is scheduled to appear for arraignment in Ventura County Municipal 
Court on Tuesday. JULIE FIELDS

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: OXNARD; JOBS PROGRAM HELPS LOW-INCOME YOUTHS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Instead of hanging out with friends, 60 youths from Oxnard are spending this 
summer painting buildings, picking up trash and mopping floors at city-owned 
facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Participants in the city's Summer Youth Program are paid minimum wage to 
perform the work, and put in eight hours a day, said program spokesman Michael 
Goldowitz. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the youths come from low-income families, and nearly all of them have 
police records, said Carlos Garza, the project's coordinator. By working 
through the summer, the program helps keep them off the streets, Garza said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hopefully, it will also help change some of the teen-agers' attitudes about 
life, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The main thing I'm hoping is that kids realize that by asking for help they 
can get help," Garza said. "Hopefully they understand they can change for the 
better." 
</P>
<P>
 Frank Flores, 17, was one of eight project workers at Durley Park on Friday. 
After the workers spend the morning cleaning and picking up trash, they help 
supervise game rooms at the city's parks. Flores was helping supervise about a 
dozen chattering kids playing games. 
</P>
<P>
 He likes the Summer Youth Program job much better than his old job at 
McDonald's, where he flipped burgers and took orders, Flores said. 
</P>
<P>
 "At this place you work and have fun at the same time," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Anna Martinez had never held down a job before she signed up for the summer 
jobs program. The 17-year-old Oxnard High student said she's glad she did it. 
</P>
<P>
 "It gives us an opportunity to find out what it's like to have a job," she 
said. "It's made me think more about what I want to do in my future." 
</P>
<P>
 The jobs program is federally funded and will continue through the end of 
August, officials said. KAY SAILLANT

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; POLICE DEPARTMENT ANNOUNCES PROMOTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Four Simi Valley police officers have been promoted effective Sept. 5, the 
date when nearly 25% of the department's 109 sworn officers are expected to 
change assignments in a departmentwide shake-up, Chief Willard R. Schlieter 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 Schlieter said last week that he has promoted Sgts.Kenneth Tacke and Rex Jones 
to the rank of lieutenant. 
</P>
<P>
 Tacke, 42, is a 19-year veteran of the department working most recently in the 
detective division supervising property crime and violent crime investigations. 
Jones, 39, has been a Simi Valley officer for more than 17 years and was 
working in the support services division on training and internal affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Schlieter also promoted Officers Anthony Anzilotti and Gregory Riegert to the 
rank of sergeant. 
</P>
<P>
 Anzilotti, 31, has served 10 years with the department in assignments ranging 
from patrol and training to the detectives division and the Special Weapons 
Team. 
</P>
<P>
 Riegert, 37, has worked in the Simi Valley department for 15 years, serving at 
times in the patrol, traffic and detectives divisions as well as administration 
and the Special Enforcement Detail. 
</P>
<P>
 Schlieter said the four men's promotions created vacancies that other officers 
will be shuffled to fill. He also plans to reassign the department's 
lieutenants to new duties, something he promised to do soon after taking office 
in March. 
</P>
<P>
 "I asked for volunteers for each of those assignments, and from those I did 
make some new assignments," he said. "It's really something (the lieutenants) 
are eager to have happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Schlieter said that by the time all the changes are finished, about 25 to 30 
officers will have switched duties. MACK REED

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: MOORPARK; COUNCIL OKS DELAY OF LOAN REPAYMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Helping to keep the local Boys & Girls Club open, the Moorpark City Council 
has voted to delay for two years the repayment of a $50,000 loan the club owes 
to the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members on Wednesday unanimously approved the extension, stating that 
they wanted to help the club stay afloat in tough financial times.The club 
would have had to repay the city in September without the extension. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think if we hadn't approved the extension they would have had to shut their 
doors," said Councilman John Wozniak. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, the city gave the club the $50,000 loan and granted it another 
$50,000 to help it purchase the old Moorpark High School gymnasium, where the 
club is now located. The club still owes about $395,000 for the building. It 
also owes about $30,000 in back taxes, said club President Tony Linton. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the club's difficult financial situation, Linton asked the city to 
consider forgiving the loan altogether, or providing a monthly payment of about 
$2,600 in operating funds. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're asking them to help us in the same manner that other cities help 
support their clubs," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 City leaders agreed to discuss the issue with club officials, but were not 
encouraging about the possibility of future funding. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are living with our own constraints," Wozniak said. "We have a very tight 
budget and further state cuts may make it even tighter. I just don't see how we 
could help more without our economic situation changing." SCOTT HADLY

CITRUS FEST SPOTLIGHTS RICH FARMING HERITAGE; SANTA PAULA: THE 27TH CELEBRATION 
RECALLS A LONG AGRICULTURAL HISTORY AND STRESSES NEED TO PROTECT LANDS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The giant flatbed truck rambled down Santa Paula's Main Street on Saturday, 
toting dozens of waving and laughing youngsters and a small grove of citrus 
trees with paper cutouts of oranges and lemons. 
</P>
<P>
 The truckload of Boys & Girls Club members and their movable forest was among 
a long line of floats, horses, cowboys, bands and marching groups that formed a 
parade for Santa Paula's 27th Annual Citrus Festival. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a pretty good time," said 12-year-old Carolina Ramirez of Santa Paula, 
just after the truck pulled off on a side street. 
</P>
<P>
 Carolina, whose father harvests avocados, said she helped club members cut out 
paper oranges and lemons that hung from the live trees placed in containers on 
the truck bed. She also helped make the colorful "Citrus on Parade" shirts worn 
by the spirited group. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Her father has explained that "crops are very important" to Santa Paula's and 
Ventura County's economy, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 And so went the second day of the festival, as children and their parents 
sampled fruit at farmers' market stands, hopped on carnival rides and learned 
about the area's rich agricultural tradition. The 100-year-old Limoneira Co., 
one of the area's largest and oldest citrus growers, set up a display with 
historical facts about citrus farming. 
</P>
<P>
 The festival started Friday afternoon and continues through this evening, with 
most activities taking place around Veterans Memorial Park. 
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Paula Kiwanis Club sponsors the three-day festival, which serves as 
the club's major fund-raiser each year. President Sheryl Trent said the club 
hopes to raise about $10,000 this year, which the nonprofit club will funnel 
back into the local community. 
</P>
<P>
 The festival celebrates decades of farming citrus -- still the largest of the 
county's crops -- through events such as a citrus recipe cook-off. Many said 
they simply turned out for a pleasant and fun day with relatives. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a single parent and this is a special outing," said Dolly Provencio, 32, 
of Santa Paula, who brought her three sons. She said she remembers attending 
the festival with her parents as a child. "I use it as a family outing." 
</P>
<P>
 For 8-year-old Sharon Beasley of Camarillo, her love of horses sent her into a 
frenzy as men dressed up as charros, or Mexican cowboys, rode by in a wagon 
pulled by horses. 
</P>
<P>
 "They had sombreros and sequins and cowboy boats," Sharon said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like the horses 'cause you can ride them and they have shiny hoofs, like 
they have nail polish on," said the auburn-haired girl. She jumped up and down 
and waved and pointed when horses passed by. "I like the prancing."  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Sharon's father, Bill, 47, said the festival is an important reminder that 
citrus ranches are vital to the economy, add beauty to the area and should be 
protected from encroaching development. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's good to showcase it," he said. "You forget the economy of the area is 
based on agriculture. Santa Paula Councilwoman Margaret Ely, who rode in the 
parade, said: "We're trying to focus attention on agriculture. We only have 
about 100,000 to 175,000 acres of agricultural land left that we can lose 
before agriculture is no longer viable in the county." 
</P>
<P>
 Ely said the county has been losing agricultural land to commercial and 
residential development since World War II. She said that if too much land is 
lost, it "makes agriculture prohibitively expensive . . . for family farmers" 
because development tends to raise water rates too high for small farmers. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1993, lemons were the county's top-grossing crop and covered the most 
acreage, said Earl McPhail, the county's agricultural commissioner. Oranges 
brought in the fourth-largest amount of money of any single crop.  
</P>
<P>
 All together, the county's citrus crops -- lemons, oranges and small 
grapefruit -- grossed about $220 million last year, he said. The county's 
overall crop value was placed at more than $850 million.

FOR FIELD OF DREAMS, A RUDE AWAKENING; SAN PEDRO: CITY TERMINATES LEASE TO 
15-ACRE LOT THAT A LOCAL COMPANY PROMISED TO TURN INTO A BASEBALL COMPLEX. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES BENNING, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A San Pedro company's plan to turn a dusty 15-acre lot into a bustling 
baseball complex with five state-of-the-art fields struck out when Los Angeles 
city officials terminated its lease. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite raising more than $400,000 in five years, San Pedro Baseball Inc. 
failed to construct a single base path on the city-owned site in the 1900 block 
of North Gaffey Street. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think that it's absolutely a crying shame that this money has produced 
basically nothing," said Barry Glickman, a spokesman for Los Angeles City 
Councilman Rudy Svorinich Jr., who represents San Pedro. 
</P>
<P>
 Svorinich wrote a letter to the city General Services Department in April 
calling for the lease to end last week. 
</P>
<P>
 The money, including a $250,000 donation from Unocal Corp., has been spent on 
plans and preliminary work, and the project is $10,000 in debt, said Gary 
Miley, president of the company. 
</P>
<P>
 San Pedro Baseball Inc. signed a $1-a-year lease with the city in 1989 with 
the understanding that baseball fields would be built for area youth. The 
project was dubbed "Field of Dreams," and collection cans were placed in shops 
around town. 
</P>
<P>
 But, over the years, the company raised less than one-third of its 
$1.6-million goal, and completed only an initial grading of the site. 
</P>
<P>
 "You'd have to say the community wasn't really behind this project 100%," 
Miley said. "I think that's disappointing." 
</P>
<P>
 Other than minor improvements to the grounds, the only indication of a dream 
on the site today is a large sign on a grassy knoll that faces traffic on 
Gaffey Street. 
</P>
<P>
 But like the worn letters on an old, beat-up baseball jersey, the paint 
heralding the future "Joan Milke Flores San Pedro Baseball Complex" has faded 
over the years. 
</P>
<P>
 Miley said his dream to build fields is still alive. The San Pedro 
longshoreman disputes the city's termination of the lease and still hopes a 
portion of the project can be completed. 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter terminating the lease, city officials said the company violated 
the agreement because it failed to build any fields on the site and provide 
proof of insurance, and because company officials admitted they allowed another 
party to store sand on the lot. 
</P>
<P>
 But Miley said the city never imposed a deadline for construction of the 
fields and insisted the firm does have adequate insurance coverage. In 
addition, he said the company received a donation for allowing sand to be 
stored on the site.  
</P>
<P>
 Miley said he delivered a letter to City Hall on July 29 detailing his 
complaints. 
</P>
<P>
 He said San Pedro Baseball Inc. is awaiting a $5-million donation from an 
international trust company in San Diego that has requested anonymity. He told 
city officials last year he was awaiting the funds, but the money never 
materialized. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the lack of progress on the site, Miley said the project became mired 
in red tape and unexpected construction costs. 
</P>
<P>
 When the company signed the lease, Miley said he was unaware of the problems 
posed by a nearby flood control channel, railroad tracks and underground 
pipelines. He was surprised to learn the company would have to pay $100,000 to 
build railroad crossing gates, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "At every turn of a corner, we just ran into a ton of obstacles," Miley said. 
"It just seemed like it was always something." 
</P>
<P>
 Unocal Corp., which has a plant in nearby Wilmington, originally pledged 
$300,000 toward the project, but oil company officials elected not to donate 
the remaining $50,000 last year because of the lack of improvements to the 
site. 
</P>
<P>
 The project's failure has disappointed San Pedro sports enthusiasts. "There's 
such an obscene need for any recreational space," said Mel Bobich, chairman of 
the San Pedro recreational task force. Baseball players in the area have a 
difficult time finding places to play, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Glickman said the city likely will solicit proposals to build fields from 
other groups in the area.

IT'S FEAST-OR-FAMINE WORLD FOR COMMUNITY LIBRARIES; SERVICES: FACED WITH SEVERE 
BUDGET CUTS, MANY FACILITIES ARE STRUGGLING TO STAY OPEN, LET ALONE BUY NEW 
MATERIALS AND BOOKS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 On the counter of the Huntington Park library, a small printed sign on a 
plastic water jug beckons to patrons: "Every penny counts. Cada centavo cuenta. 
" The jar is about one-quarter full, with several dollar bills but mostly loose 
change and a few rolls of pennies. 
</P>
<P>
 That's the extent of the fund raising at this county library branch. If the 
staff is thrifty, they'll be able to buy a few new bestsellers that patrons 
have been clamoring for. 
</P>
<P>
 Several miles away in Watts, employees of Los Angeles' Watts branch wait it 
out in a small, cramped building overflowing with books, videotapes and 
computers while construction continues on their new $2.8-million library due to 
open in the fall of 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Such is the feast-or-famine world of community libraries. 
</P>
<P>
 A branch's quality -- perhaps its very existence -- can depend more upon which 
system it belongs to and how much private support it garners than on how badly 
the community might need its services. 
</P>
<P>
 People who live in Los Angeles enjoy a city library system that, one way or 
another, has been finding enough cash of late to improve or construct 
buildings, buy materials and fill long-vacant positions. Yet residents of 
nearby cities and unincorporated areas find their county system's branches 
struggling to stay open, let alone buy new books. 
</P>
<P>
 "The public keeps coming in and asking, 'Do you have bestsellers?' And I say 
'What bestsellers? We haven't bought bestsellers in two years,' " said Alfredo 
Zuniga, library manager of the county's Anthony Quinn branch on the Eastside. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's 63-branch system has an operating budget of $36.7 million this 
fiscal year, an increase of almost 7% over last, but the county's 87-branch 
system has a budget of $47.6 million, down 26% from the previous fiscal year's 
$64.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Library experts say the result is more than some inconvenienced book-lovers. 
Because children using local libraries to prepare homework assignments become 
exposed to literature there, library financial problems could affect the 
literacy of future generations. 
</P>
<P>
 "In minority areas, especially, you already have some children who are reading 
below their (grade) level -- but at least they could get in the library after 
school and get a book," said Lydia Hammons, manager of the county's Willowbrook 
library. With dwindling operating hours and a declining inventory, that 
opportunity has become more limited. 
</P>
<P>
 The Willowbrook branch is almost hidden in the Kenneth Hahn Plaza, behind a 
key shop and a toy store. The magazine shelves have as many empty spaces as 
they do magazines. And the book selection is sometimes sparse. With two 
elementary schools within blocks of the branch, classes used to visit daily 
before the major budget cutbacks two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "With the library only being open two days a week we probably lose kids," 
Hammons said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Mayra Jacinto, 10, used to go to her local Huntington Park library every 
afternoon for story time, but not since the library has been closing on 
Thursdays and Fridays. On the days the library is open, Mayra is busy dusting 
bookshelves, sweeping the rugs and putting up posters as a summer junior 
volunteer worker. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayra's volunteer work at the Huntington Park branch would happen whether or 
not the county library system was having financial difficulties, said 
children's librarian Karen D. Holmes. But the reduction of staff has created a 
need for more adult volunteers to take over a few extra duties. 
</P>
<P>
 "It feels like our staff has just been wiped out and we just creep along by 
whatever means we can," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The county branches are victims of an $11-million library department budget 
shortfall that shows no signs of abating. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the worst it's been (for the county libraries)," said David Flint, 
assistant director for finance and planning with the County of Los Angeles 
Public Libraries. "We were the most severely impacted libraries in the state -- 
both in dollar amount and percentage of our whole budget." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The county library district closed 10 branches in fiscal 1992-93 because of 
budget cuts, bringing the system down to 87 branches. Since last year's round 
of budget cuts, the system has laid off 370 full- and part-time workers, cut 
service hours by 65% and halted all purchases of new books, magazines and 
tapes. 
</P>
<P>
 More than half of the libraries are only open two days a week, and seven of 
them are in Central and South Los Angeles and the Southeast cities. 
</P>
<P>
 All this finds the East Los Angeles, View Park and Willowbrook branches and 
the libraries in Bell and Huntington Park hoping their bad situation doesn't 
become worse. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're considered nonessential services -- jails are more important than 
libraries," Holmes said. "But, really, libraries are more important than jails. 
We keep people out of jail."  
</P>
<P>
 The county libraries' immediate problems go back to last year, when Gov. Pete 
Wilson and the Legislature shifted $2.2 billion of property tax revenue to 
schools while balancing the state budget. The Los Angeles County library 
system, which relies heavily on property taxes, lost $29.4 million of its 
annual revenue overnight. 
</P>
<P>
 When several of the system's libraries were recently threatened with closure, 
the county Board of Supervisors stepped in with a $2.5-million loan to keep 
them open at least until September. By then the county must either raise 
additional funds or set in place a funding operation to ensure that the money 
will be raised. 
</P>
<P>
 In June the board voted 3 to 1 to support a special tax district to fund 
county libraries and allow them to return to a five-day schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 City councils in the 52 municipalities in the county's library district must 
decide whether they will join in. Only property owners in the unincorporated 
parts of the county and the participating cities will be taxed, county 
officials said, estimating that the average homeowner would pay less than $30 
per year. 
</P>
<P>
 Only libraries in these areas would receive the funding. The supervisors have 
scheduled an Aug. 30 public hearing on the matter. 
</P>
<P>
 County library officials are also hoping for relief through a bill sponsored 
by state Sen. David A. Roberti (D-Van Nuys). The bill, SB-1448, would allow 
public libraries statewide to form special assessment districts to raise 
operating funds. Wilson vetoed a similar bill last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, county libraries have mounted ambitious private fund-raising 
efforts on their own. 
</P>
<P>
 "Independent of what we hope to get from the state, we have a fairly active 
private fund-raising effort going on, plus the activities we have from our 
Friends groups," Flint said.  
</P>
<P>
 The 12 county libraries in Central and South Los Angeles and in the Southeast 
cities have come to rely heavily on their individual Friends of the Library 
organizations, which have helped spread the word about the branches in addition 
to getting donations of money, books or other supplies. 
</P>
<P>
 The East Los Angeles' Friends organization, founded last November, has 
garnered strong community support through a door-to-door campaign and 
storytelling festivals. The group's rummage sale during a countywide library 
fund-raiser brought in $1,600. Huntington Park's Friends group for the 
children's library has donated books, magazine racks and periodicals.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Los Angeles system's nearly 30 inner-city branches are not in 
dire financial straits, they still rely on private sources for summer reading 
programs, computer classes or to buy more books than the city budget can 
support. For inner-city branches, raising the funds is more difficult than in 
other . 
</P>
<P>
 "Friends groups in places like Woodland Hills, Sherman Oaks and West L.A. can 
raise over $1,000 a month in fund-raising drives," said Arthur Pond, senior 
librarian at the city's Hyde Park branch. "Here we raise about $125. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 "The distribution of advantages in Los Angeles follows very closely the 
neighborhoods of big campaign contributors," said Jeb Brighouse, a community 
activist in Echo Park, where the local branch library has been housed in 
temporary quarters on North Laveta Terrace since the 1971 Sylmar earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials dispute such comments. 
</P>
<P>
 "Very often there is a perceived disparity among communities (for public works 
projects)," said Fontayne Holmes, assistant director of branches for the Los 
Angeles Public Library. "But I can say, in the library department, that is 
really not true. There is equitable distribution of library funds throughout 
the city." 
</P>
<P>
 The city has just finished taking bids for a new Echo Park branch, but no 
ground has been broken, said Robert G. Reagan, a spokesman for the city library 
system.  
</P>
<P>
 Twenty-five of the city branches are undergoing major rebuilding or 
renovation, thanks to a $53.4-million bond issue passed by voters in 1989 and 
federal Community Development Block Grant funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Eight branches in Central and South Los Angeles are being repaired or replaced 
because the historic sites needed to be brought up to seismic code or because 
the libraries' resources were outgrowing their facilities, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The new 12,500-square-foot Watts branch is scheduled to open at 103rd Street 
and Compton Avenue. In June, workers began renovating the Memorial branch at 
4625 W. Olympic Blvd. in Country Club Park, the Angeles Mesa library at 2400 W. 
52nd St. and the John Muir branch at 1005 W. 64th St.

OVERNIGHT CHILD CARE OFFERS PARENTS MORE FLEXIBILITY; SERVICES: AS THE NUMBER 
OF EMPLOYEES WORKING IRREGULAR HOURS GROWS, MANY ARE TURNING TO SPECIAL-HOURS 
BABY-SITTERS.

<P>
 The day is turning to evening as 5-year-old Zachary and 3-year-old Jonathan 
Witherspoon arrive at Debi Magdaleno's West Los Angeles home, each boy toting a 
Ninja Turtle backpack containing a toothbrush, pajamas and a favorite toy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm late, I'm late. Give me a kiss goodby," Denise Witherspoon tells 
Jonathan, her son, and Zachary, her nephew. 
</P>
<P>
 The boys clamber out of the car and Jonathan dutifully kisses his mother. 
Zachary runs to greet Magdaleno and her 7-year-old daughter, Marina, who are 
waiting to welcome the boys. 
</P>
<P>
 Waving farewell, Witherspoon rushes off to begin her 7 p.m.-to-7 a.m. shift as 
a bone marrow transplant nurse at UCLA Medical Center, while Magdaleno takes 
the children in the back yard to play for a few minutes in the fading light. 
</P>
<P>
 The scene is a typical slice of day care life -- except, of course, that this 
day care starts at dusk. The Magdaleno house, which has been a family child 
care facility for two years, is soon full of activity: As Magdaleno prepares a 
dinner of pizza, fruit and milk, Zachary, Jonathan and Marina are busy coloring 
and playing with their Play-Doh. 
</P>
<P>
 After eating every slice of pizza, the children change into their pajamas, 
brush their teeth, and snuggle in bed for story time. 
</P>
<P>
 The pattern is familiar to the children; the boys usually spend two nights a 
week with Magdaleno, a licensed child care provider. When bedtime comes, they 
settle down to sleep with a minimum of fuss. 
</P>
<P>
 As the number of employees working irregular hours grows, many parents -- 
particularly single parents -- are turning to late-night and overnight child 
care. 
</P>
<P>
 For some, it's having to work late hours or meet with clients in the evenings. 
For others, the traditional hours of child care must be extended because of 
graveyard and swing-shift work in the manufacturing or service industries. 
</P>
<P>
 "I benefit from working at night, because I get paid more than I would during 
the day," said Witherspoon, a single parent who has been working late shifts 
since 1988. "And the boys have a stable place like Debi's to go. It's a home 
atmosphere, so they go from our home during the day to another home at night." 
</P>
<P>
 Although few child care centers provide late-night and overnight care, many 
family care providers in and near the Westside offer such services out of their 
homes and apartments. 
</P>
<P>
 In the area bounded by Malibu in the north, Redondo Beach to the south and 
Silver Lake on the east, there are more than 200 licensed family care providers 
that offer 24-hour service, according to child care referral agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents are increasingly seeking after-hours child care for a range of 
reasons, said Tracey Dickson of Connections for Children, a Santa Monica child 
care referral agency that serves much of the Westside.  
</P>
<P>
 Some parents use overnight care service regularly while they work or 
periodically while they attend evening meetings. Prominent among the customers 
are single parents, whose numbers are growing nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, 27% of children under 18 lived with only one parent, up from 12% in 
1970, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. On the job front, 14 million 
full-time employees -- 18% of the nation's full-time work force -- worked 
something other than a daytime shift in 1991. This represents an addition of 2 
million such workers over the previous six years, according to the U.S. Bureau 
of Labor. 
</P>
<P>
 The labor bureau also estimates that the top five growth occupations in the 
1990s will be waiters and waitresses, registered nurses, janitors and cleaners, 
managers and cashiers -- all of which will require long hours and some off-hour 
shift work. 
</P>
<P>
 Some parents only need care that extends a few hours past the traditional, 
end-of-the-workday pickup time. 
</P>
<P>
 Anita Charles of West Los Angeles said she has taken care of little Stefano 
Lazano for almost a year, six days a week. Lazano, who is almost 3 years old, 
stays with Charles and her three children from morning to almost 9 p.m. while 
his father works late as a store manager and his mother holds down her job as a 
flight attendant. 
</P>
<P>
 "Money-wise, there is no advantage to (taking) children at night, and it is 
more responsibility," Charles said. "But I try and help those parents out there 
who need the help, because I'm a parent, too." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Other parents seek all-night care. 
</P>
<P>
 "I see a lot of low-income mothers who truly care about their kids, but have 
no choice but to take a night job," said Pat Onuorah, who offers 24-hour family 
care at her Ladera Heights home. "Every night, I have at least one child who 
stays over." 
</P>
<P>
 Onuorah is licensed to care for 12 children at any given time, a typical 
number for family care providers. And like most providers, Onuorah, who works 
at the Watts Health Foundation during the day, hires assistants to help her 
watch children and prepare meals. 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent evening, about a dozen children were sprawled on her living room 
floor, playing games, eating spaghetti and watching the video "Aladdin." 
</P>
<P>
 One baby in the room was scheduled to stay with Onuorah for four days. "He's 
very adaptable and independent," Onuorah said of the 15-month-old boy, whose 
mother is a flight attendant. "He's been going to baby-sitters ever since he 
was born." 
</P>
<P>
 Family care providers sometimes charge by the hour, from $5 to $9, or on a 
weekly basis from $50 to $125 -- prices that are comparable to those for 
daytime care. Some licensed providers may charge extra for overnight or weekend 
care, however. 
</P>
<P>
 To be licensed by the state Department of Social Services, family providers 
must meet certain requirements, which include attending a licensing seminar, 
being fingerprinted and having their homes deemed safe for children. 
</P>
<P>
 While many family care providers are willing to offer late-night and overnight 
care, few, if any, child care centers in Los Angeles provide 24-hour service. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're not going to find many child care centers willing to provide that type 
of care because it's not profitable at all," said Tammy Baker of Child and 
Family Services, a child care referral agency that serves Beverly Hills, 
Hollywood, Mid-Wilshire and downtown areas. "You need to pay your workers 
overtime and it's hard to maintain a steady clientele." 
</P>
<P>
 And many parents with non-traditional work schedules prefer leaving their 
children in a home setting rather than an institutionalized child care 
facility. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you have to drop your child off at night in their pajamas, would you want 
to take them to a place where the person who answers the door is wearing 
pajamas and your child can snuggle up in a bed in their home?" Baker asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "Or would you want to go to a place with fluorescent lights, where they put 
your child on a cot?" 
</P>
<P>
 Sharon Cannon, a single parent raising a 15-month-old daughter, Shanice, said 
she would have had to leave her swing-shift job at the U.S. Post Office if she 
hadn't been referred to Agnes Lewis' child care facility. 
</P>
<P>
 Every afternoon, when Cannon drops Shanice off at Lewis' Inglewood home at 
about 3:15 p.m., Lewis makes it a point to tell the baby, "Your mommy's going 
to work now. She'll be back tonight to pick you up." 
</P>
<P>
 Cannon then kisses her baby goodby, and waves to her as she walks to her car. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really important for them to wave to each other," Lewis said. "That way 
Shanice knows she's coming back." 
</P>
<P>
 After watching her mother's car drive away, Shanice goes inside to play with 
the seven other children under Lewis' care. A few hours later, after most of 
the other children have gone home, Lewis and Shanice have dinner. Shanice is 
then tucked into bed, only to be stirred out of sleep shorty after midnight. 
</P>
<P>
 "You ready to see Mama?" Lewis asks Shanice, as she lifts the sleepy but 
smiling child from her crib. "It's time to go home." 
</P>
<P>
 When Lewis first started watching Shanice early this year, Shanice would cry 
and hold on tight to her mother. 
</P>
<P>
 "Her mother would sit in her car and hear her screaming inside," Lewis said. 
"That made her feel so bad. She kept saying, 'Hopefully, one of these days, I 
won't have to work.' " 
</P>
<P>
 For now, however, Cannon packs up Shanice, says good night to Lewis, and 
drives to her home in the Ladera Heights area. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the reluctance of some parents to leave their children in overnight 
care, many have no other options. Few companies, even those with employees 
working irregular hours, have considered round-the-clock child care. 
</P>
<P>
 "The issue of 24-hour care has been brought up from time to time, and the 
unions have asked about it," said Sylvia Woodside, a human services manager for 
the U.S. Postal Service in Los Angeles. "But we've held off because of the lack 
of funding." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Childrens Hospital Los Angeles used to offer 24-hour child care to its 
employees, but the program was discontinued because the hospital couldn't 
maintain a steady enrollment. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe there's a hesitancy to put kids in a center at night," said Darcy 
Williams, who runs the hospital's child care program. "All the guilt that women 
feel about leaving their child at a center is compounded at night. We're 
considering bringing back 24-hour care, but we would only do so with trained 
people and lots of planning. It's a very distant thought." 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA is one of the rare Westside employers that responds to its employees' 
off-hour child care needs. Magdaleno's family child care facility, Debicare, is 
run through the university's child care services, and was contracted to provide 
overnight home care specifically for UCLA Medical Center employees who must 
work late shifts.

KICKING HABIT ISN'T EASY AFTER DECADES OF SMOKING; TOBACCO: HARD-CORE PUFFERS 
ARE THE PEOPLE THE GOVERNMENT HOPES TO HELP AS IT ZEROES IN ON ADDICTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The doctor basically put it to Ray Dahlin this way: Do you want to live or do 
you want to smoke? 
</P>
<P>
 The choice is that stark for the 58-year-old Fountain Valley resident, who has 
emphysema, diabetes, high blood pressure and a history of six heart attacks 
since the early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm starting all over from scratch again," said Dahlin, speaking after the 
first session of a smoking cessation class, two hours after finishing what he 
has dubbed his last cigarette. He hopes this Kaiser Permanente class in Anaheim 
will work better than the aversion therapy, hypnosis, nicotine patch, scare 
tactics and cessation classes he has tried before. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has to work," he vows, as much to himself as anyone else in the room. "It 
will." 
</P>
<P>
 Dahlin and his classmates don't show much interest in an federal Food and Drug 
Administration panel's pronouncement last week that nicotine in cigarettes can 
be addictive. They don't tend to use the "A-word," and the news didn't give 
them much more incentive to quit than they already have. But they represent the 
kind of tough cases that government hopes to help as it zeroes in on the 
addictive nature of tobacco. 
</P>
<P>
 FDA or no FDA, they have a habit -- this thing that used to be all right with 
almost everybody and went well with dinner, drinks and just about everything 
else -- and now it's abundantly clear must be stopped. 
</P>
<P>
 But quitting, as they know from painful experience, is hell. 
</P>
<P>
 These are hard-core puffers, many of whom learned to light up before they 
learned to drive. They have been nagged by relatives, prodded by co-workers, 
preached at by doctors, zapped by electrodes -- and now warned by a federal 
panel. Still, there is something about the pleasurable memories smoking evokes, 
how it breaks up a stressful day or tops off a good wine, that keeps them 
reaching for that pack and matches. 
</P>
<P>
 And there's something about the anxiety, grouchiness, insomnia, inability to 
concentrate and the I-don't-know-what-the-heck-to-do-with-my-hands feeling, for 
example, that keeps them from following through with those heartfelt pledges to 
go clean. 
</P>
<P>
 Do they really want to quit? 
</P>
<P>
 "That's a hell of a loaded question," said Dahlin, who started stealing his 
father's cigarettes at the age of 8, a half-century ago. 
</P>
<P>
 He wants to live to see next year, he said. He needs to quit. But he keeps 
getting waylaid by little things, like the time he quit for three weeks, then 
went out for drinks with the guys. 
</P>
<P>
 "Between the vodka and the sevens, the cigarettes popped up, and away I went," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some pull out Freudian concepts to characterize their internal struggle. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rational thinking says I want to quit," said Hermann Haselbeck, 69, of Rancho 
Santa Margarita, whose habit is 49 years old. "But you don't get away with just 
rational thinking. There's such a thing as the subconscious mind." 
</P>
<P>
 Haselbeck, who is not in the Kaiser class, half-jokingly attributes his habit 
to early trauma. 
</P>
<P>
 "My mother took the pacifier away from me too soon," he said, adding: "She 
must have had a hell of a time getting me to give it up." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, doctors say addiction to cigarettes has powerful psychological 
components, as well as physical ones. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem from a psychological standpoint is cigarettes seem to go with 
everything," said Dr. Richard Helfant, a UCI cardiologist who has written a 
book on heart disease in women, which addresses the problem of quitting 
smoking. "For a lot of people psychologically, it's not just a diversion but a 
way of relating to life. . . . There is a real reflex to reach for a cigarette 
when under stress." 
</P>
<P>
 Smokers are "unwilling to step out of their comfort zone," said Kaiser Health 
educator Carolyn Russell, who has taught smoking cessation classes for 14 
years. "It's, 'What am I going to do when I'm sitting in traffic, after my 
meal, with my coffee. How am I going to handle stress?' Those are the things 
that prevent them" from quitting, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some smokers liken the comfort a cigarette provides to that of a comrade. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a friend, it's my friend, " said Garden Grove resident Carol Cobleigh, 
51, a two-pack-a-day smoker who has been at it since she was 14. "No matter 
what kind of a bad day I'm having I can just go sit down and have a cigarette 
and it always makes me feel better for a few minutes." 
</P>
<P>
 Cobleigh readily admits that she is addicted to cigarettes, but many smokers 
avoid that term. 
</P>
<P>
 "They don't want to admit they are addicted to a really little stick. . . . 
They just don't want to be labeled a drug addict," Russell said. 
</P>
<P>
 The smoking industry, too, prefers the term "habit," likening the effects to 
those of substances like caffeine. 
</P>
<P>
 But doctors say the physical addiction to nicotine can be powerful, and the 
effects of withdrawal on the body can be fierce. Some compare the strength of 
the addiction, but not the symptoms, to that of heroin or cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
 Physical symptoms of withdrawal occur because the body gets used to having the 
chemical enter the system and bind to receptors in the brain, which ultimately 
cause constriction of peripheral blood vessels, an increased heart rate and a 
general feeling of alertness. 
</P>
<P>
 When the chemical suddenly is no longer there, "the body compensates by 
becoming more anxious," said Dr. Rimal Bera, director of clinical inpatient 
services at the UCI neuropsychiatric hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 "Initially, I think (the withdrawal's) more physical," Bera said. "It can last 
several weeks to months." Later, a craving can linger that he said may be more 
psychological. 
</P>
<P>
 Bera said the memory of smoking, the lingering impression of those physical 
sensations, can keep that craving alive for as long as a few decades. 
</P>
<P>
 Craving, in fact, was the reason most often cited for relapse in a 1993 study 
of 132 smokers by Copenhagen researchers. 
</P>
<P>
 Many successful quitters "sense this urge, but as time goes on they learn to 
keep this urge under control," Bera said. 
</P>
<P>
 That's not much comfort to Garden Grove resident Cobleigh. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I hear people say 'I quit 28 years ago and I still want a cigarette,' 
that drives me crazy," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 She doesn't much look forward to the short-term effects of kicking the habit 
either. Even when she had a nicotine skin patch, which is intended to wean 
smokers gradually from the drug, she was overcome by stress. 
</P>
<P>
 One day at the insurance office where she worked, a week after she stopped 
smoking, "everything was bugging me. . . . I started talking real loud about 
something somebody did that shouldn't have happened. I way overreacted and 
ended up in tears." 
</P>
<P>
 To calm down, she took a walk and lit a cigarette. 
</P>
<P>
 "The thing was, I wasn't doing the things physically that I was used to doing. 
I kind of like would look forward to that one cigarette all day long. For me, 
not to smoke, it's like giving up a part of myself." 
</P>
<P>
 Other smokers say that the skin patch seems to help with the physical symptoms 
of withdrawal, but it's no cure for that nagging craving. Laboratory testing of 
the patch before it was introduced showed that about 20% of people remained 
smoke-free after one year's use, but the actual success rate is thought to be 
much lower, with estimates ranging down to 9%. 
</P>
<P>
 Bera said it would be possible for some physical withdrawal symptoms to 
persist even with the patch, since the nicotine is seeping slowly through the 
skin, not being inhaled into the lungs where it quickly passes into the 
bloodstream. 
</P>
<P>
 Doctors, educators and smokers seem to agree that some combination of the 
patch with other supports, especially encouragement from family members and a 
class or support group, is most effective. 
</P>
<P>
 George Wilkinson, 44, who watched his father die of emphysema and wants to 
avoid the same fate, sure hopes so. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tried to quit two times," the Yorba Linda resident said. "Quit number one, 
I was trying to use tapes and a class. For four days, I religiously put my 
heart into it. Something was missing there. 
</P>
<P>
 "The second time, I did the patch without the class. That didn't work either 
because I found out I could use the patch and smoke. . . . This time, I'm going 
to try class and the patch." 
</P>
<P>
 The good news for the persistent bunch who repeatedly have tried and failed to 
quit is that research shows they are more likely than first-timers to succeed. 
</P>
<P>
 "The more you've tried, the better your chances," Helfant said. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, he said, it's almost never too late to quit; the risk of smoking-related 
disease drops substantially after a year of abstinence. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts stressed that hurling scary information at smokers and trying to 
browbeat them into quitting is not productive. 
</P>
<P>
 "It isn't that these people don't know the dangers or that they don't want to 
quit," Helfant said. "Many of them do want to quit, but they feel that the 
habit, for all of these reasons, is too strong for them."

LAND SWAP WOULD ONLY ADD TO FOREST'S ALLURE; NATURE: THOSE ESCAPING URBAN ILLS 
FLOCK TO O.C. OUTBACK. IRVINE CO.'S PRESERVE WOULD OFFER MORE ROOM TO MEANDER.

 This is the place where rattlesnakes roam. Mountain lions, too. 
</P>
<P>
 Not to mention deer, cattle, bobcats, golden eagles, spotted owls, California 
gnatcatchers . . . and the occasional urbanite seeking refuge from Southern 
California stress. 
</P>
<P>
 After a century as an Orange County landmark, the Cleveland National Forest 
was thrust into the spotlight this week in the contentious debate over the 
future of the El Toro Marine Corps Air Station. 
</P>
<P>
 Under a land-swap plan that local business and government leaders say has 
surprising support, the Irvine Co. would gain control of El Toro. The federal 
government, in turn, would get thousands of acres next to the forest in 
northern Orange County, including Gypsum, Blind, Fremont and Weir canyons. 
</P>
<P>
 The land-swap plan is part of a sweeping national program by the Clinton 
Administration to obtain dozens of military bases scheduled for closure and 
trade them for environmentally sensitive land that could otherwise be 
developed. 
</P>
<P>
 Local environmental groups have suggested that 10,000 acres next to the forest 
and owned by the Irvine Co. be traded for most of the base to preserve a mix of 
rare Tecate cypress, oak woodlands and coastal sage that is home to prairie 
falcons and golden eagles. 
</P>
<P>
 The canyons also house the habitat of the California gnatcatcher and the rare 
orange-throated whiptail lizard. Mountain lions, coyote and deer abound. 
</P>
<P>
 If the deal can be worked out, the acreage, stretching further along the Santa 
Ana Mountains, can become part of a natural local treasure that drew 3 million 
visitors last year. 
</P>
<P>
 With nearly half a million acres of mountainous chaparral dotted with 356 
miles of hiking trails and 831 campsites, the federally run forest is a 
recreational haven situated less than two hour's drive from downtown Santa Ana, 
Los Angeles or San Diego. There are large swaths of untouched primitive 
wilderness, a prehistoric archeological site recently closed because of 
graffiti vandalism, and one of the world's premier telescope observatories. 
</P>
<P>
 "I get tired of the urban jungle, cement, phones, demands, whatever. It's nice 
to lay down and look up at the sky and see that it's really blue," said Sue 
Zurawik, 48, a graphic designer who works in Anaheim Hills but spent Friday in 
the forest with her two burly dogs, Sheila and Pepper. 
</P>
<P>
 What's the attraction? 
</P>
<P>
 "Just basically to get away from the world -- and I can do it in just a 
weekend," Zurawik said to explain why she has been camping regularly in the 
forest for the past five years. "It seems to be far enough away from the city 
life, you don't hear the traffic or anything. It's kind of hidden." 
</P>
<P>
 Once inside the forest's borders, it is the cities that seem far off and 
hidden. 
</P>
<P>
 On a clear day, visitors can view the ocean from its mountaintops, but most 
vistas overflow with tree-covered canyons and hills and the Cleveland National 
Forest stretches for what looks like forever. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the forest reaches to the Mexican border, with fingers in Orange, 
Riverside and San Diego counties. The southernmost of California's 18 national 
forests, it has three distinct sections, each managed separately and with its 
own unique gems. 
</P>
<P>
 The Descanso and Palomar districts lie mainly within San Diego County. 
Descanso features Corral Canyon, filled with off-road trails for motorcycles 
and dune buggies, and Laguna Mountain Recreation Area. 
</P>
<P>
 Palomar takes its name from the forest's highest peak, 6,140 feet above sea 
level, a mountain that gets 40 inches of rain each year. It is home to the 
California Institute of Technology's 200-inch telescope, one of the first 
through which scientists recently saw a comet bombarding Jupiter. 
</P>
<P>
 But the largest portion -- and the one that would grow with the land swap -- 
is the Trabuco district, which sits mainly in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Enter Trabuco off the Ortega Highway, 25 miles east of the Santa Ana Freeway 
exit in San Juan Capistrano. Stop by the El Cariso visitor center for 
information, walk the San Juan Creek loop, wind your way up to Blue Jay or 
Falcon campgrounds, or enter the San Mateo Canyon Wilderness, where no bikes or 
vehicles are allowed. 
</P>
<P>
 It's hot in the summer, so peak months when the crowds come are October 
through May. 
</P>
<P>
 Tucked inside Trabuco, on parcels that do not belong to the forest but lie 
within its borders, are dozens of rustic homes; gold and silver mining 
prospects; a camp for juvenile delinquents, and Orange County's only nudist 
colony. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the only undeveloped land that has full public access -- without having 
to pay a fee or anything -- in Orange County," said Ernie Martinsen, resource 
and recreation officer for the Trabuco district. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just unique in that it's open in this urban area, and that it's 
basically wild," he said. "It's not like a city park and it's not like a 
national park. Here it's self-service . . . you're on your own." 
</P>
<P>
 Because of budget cuts, a thin staff patrols and maintains the forest, which 
is one of 155 national forests that cover 191 million acres in 40 states. Much 
of the personnel is devoted to fighting fires, which erupt often, while others 
study wildlife that live there. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you go in, there's no sheriff. If you injure yourself, you can bet that 
rescue is going to be a long time away," Martinsen said. "It's basically 
observing nature. A lot of people go in just to experience the primitive-type 
environment. There's no telephones, no fire hydrants, no houses. You have to go 
in self-contained -- there's no McDonald's on the corner." 
</P>
<P>
 The forest began more than a century ago, in 1893, when President Benjamin 
Harrison preserved 50,000 acres. President Grover Cleveland added 700,000 acres 
in 1897. A decade later, President Theodore Roosevelt combined the parcels and 
greatly expanded the area. 
</P>
<P>
 He named the forest for Cleveland in 1908. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the land was later released, leaving the three-part forest with its 
current expanse of 422,340 acres. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the Cleveland National Forest had 3 million visitors. With a budget 
of $9.9 million, there are 213 full-time employees, 132 seasonal employees and 
nearly 600 volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
 One-quarter of the revenue collected by the forest is returned to the counties 
where it is located. Last year, Orange County earned $26,809 from forest use 
fees. 
</P>
<P>
 In the winter, water runs through San Juan Creek, which is shadowed by huge 
oak and sycamore trees. There is also spruce and pine, and some rare plants, 
such as the least Bell's vireo. As an urban forest, the Cleveland has far more 
day users than long-term vacationers. 
</P>
<P>
 "They just want to hike a trail, maybe have a picnic, get away from it all -- 
for a few hours, that's it," said Trabuco wildlife biologist Mary Thomas. "You 
can hear the hum, the urban hum, but other than that you can completely forget. 
It's marvelous to know that you can drive just a few miles out of the city and 
the city will almost disappear." 
</P>
<P>
 But with wildlife running free, visitors must be careful. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just this morning I saw a bobcat right here, ran across the road," said 
Donald Wolff, Trabuco recreation technician, as his forest-ranger pickup 
lumbered up the mountain to Blue Jay campground Friday afternoon. "It was about 
a 35-pounder. 
</P>
<P>
 "About five years ago we had a dog on the loop trail that got bit (by a 
mountain lion). He died there," said Wolff, who has worked at the Cleveland 
National Forest for a decade and with the National Forest Service for two. "Had 
to go clean him up the next day. That's about all I can remember." 
</P>
<P>
 But later, Wolff recalls another story, about a Boy Scout troop staying at the 
Falcon campground. 
</P>
<P>
 "They could hear the animals running around in the woods, it must have been a 
bobcat chasing a rabbit," he said with a smile. "They could hear the last 
squeal, and they could hear him bringing it up in the tree. That's one of the 
treats you get." 
</P>
<P>
 Wolff said he is not afraid of bobcats or lions -- or, for that matter, of the 
rattlesnakes that he sights regularly on the trails. Still, he hasn't camped in 
the forest in years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm out here five, six days a week," he chuckled. "Day off? I'll go to the 
city." 
</P>

NEWS ANALYSIS; IS END TO O.C. BASE ISSUE NEAR OR IS THIS JUST ANOTHER TWIST? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 For more than a year now, the debate over the future of El Toro Marine Corps 
Air Station has taken more dips and turns than the wildest, creakiest political 
roller-coaster ride anywhere in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Competing egos and agendas have constantly threatened to throw the base 
conversion planning off track. And whenever there was the slightest chance that 
a communitywide consensus might be possible, the battle for power over the base 
would take another turn -- a threatened lawsuit by those opposed to a 
commercial airport at El Toro, followed by a wild spin leading to a November 
ballot initiative asking county voters to approve an airport. 
</P>
<P>
 Suddenly, there's a new twist: The powerful Irvine Co. may be making a move 
toward ownership of the 4,700-acre base -- the largest piece of Orange County 
property that holds the promise of a development bonanza. 
</P>
<P>
 Under a plan disclosed late last week, the Irvine Co. and the federal 
government are discussing a land swap in which the development firm would take 
possession of the base in exchange for large parcels of wilderness that it owns 
near the Cleveland National Forest. Environmentalists have identified 10,000 
acres of northern Orange County land that could become part of the trade. 
</P>
<P>
 The news of the potential land swap immediately set off speculation among 
various political factions that have wrestled for control of the military base 
because they disagree over whether a commercial airport should be developed 
there. 
</P>
<P>
 Is this just another leg in this tumultuous political journey, or is it the 
solution that can help end the unusual political battle that has split Orange 
County in half? 
</P>
<P>
 The answer to that question depends on who is asked. 
</P>
<P>
 Key county officials -- who were criticized early on for not taking the lead 
in developing a post-military plan and were forced to give up sole control of 
the issue -- see the Irvine Co.'s involvement as a way to shortcut the debate 
and settle the issue once and for all. 
</P>
<P>
 Some county supervisors say that if the base reverts to private ownership and 
remains in an unincorporated area of the county, then the Board of Supervisors 
could regain its place as the only land-use authority over the property. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Harriett M. Wieder said the land-exchange proposal should be taken 
as vote of "no confidence" in the El Toro Reuse Planning Authority, a 
multi-agency group formed out of political friction that is now attempting to 
devise a redevelopment plan for El Toro. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think people don't see any hope in the process established here, and they 
began to look for other options," Wieder said. "It's a reflection of the 
political integrity of the planning authority as an objective policy-making 
body." 
</P>
<P>
 A Washington base closure expert said privately that the Irvine Co.'s possible 
ownership of the base "appears to cut out the community" input, which would be 
"most unfortunate." 
</P>
<P>
 Should the county try to exert control over the land, it can expect strong 
opposition from South County city officials who begrudgingly signed on to the 
El Toro planning board, which includes the county supervisors, three Irvine 
council members and one representative from Lake Forest. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there's a severe question about (the county having sole authority 
over the property)," said Irvine Councilman Barry J. Hammond. "If, in fact, it 
goes to private ownership, we will move ahead on annexation (of the base)." 
</P>
<P>
 Hammond said his city joined the planning authority board after receiving a 
commitment from the county to help Irvine annex the base, which lies within the 
city's sphere of influence. Hammond said the city plans to hold the county to 
that pledge. 
</P>
<P>
 Hammond, Lake Forest Mayor Marcia Rudolph and Laguna Beach Councilman Wayne L. 
Peterson also maintained that the Defense Department already has recognized the 
planning authority board as the official planning group. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just because the property owner's name changes doesn't mean there will be a 
change in the development process," Peterson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The early euphoria over the Irvine Co.'s possible involvement in the issue has 
led one anti-airport activist to caution against moving too hastily. 
</P>
<P>
 Doyle Selden, a resident of Leisure World of Laguna Hills and a member of the 
anti-airport group called Taxpayers for Responsible Planning, said planning 
studies now underway should be completed before any deal is struck with the 
Irvine Co. or any airport initiative is approved by voters. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are really upset with the simplistic statements which are made," Selden 
said. "It's completely clear to us that the more complex this is, the more we 
need a planning process." 
</P>
<P>
 Pete Ciesla, the Navy's El Toro base closure coordinator, agreed that the 
planning authority board would probably continue to help guide the base's 
future use, even if the property ends up in private hands. "You still need to 
evaluate the impacts and look at things like (traffic) circulation," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But those who favor the development of a commercial airport at El Toro see it 
another way. 
</P>
<P>
 "The (local planning) process has all but fallen apart," said Newport Beach 
Mayor Clarence J. Turner, a strong El Toro airport advocate. "If the base is 
given to the Irvine Co., you can pretty much forget about the El Toro Reuse 
Planning Authority." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of worrying over whether the land should become an airport, Turner 
said the county should begin negotiating a plan with the Irvine Co., on behalf 
of its cities, to share revenue from a commercial airport should the giant 
developer decide on that option. 
</P>
<P>
 There also is a new debate over the effect the Irvine Co.'s involvement might 
have on the November ballot initiative that asks voters to approve a commercial 
aviation and cargo facility on 2,000 acres of the base. 
</P>
<P>
 Newport Beach developer Buck Johns, one of the initiative backers, said the 
latest development should not impact the November election. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Irvine Co. has been unusually quiet on this issue," Johns said, "but you 
have to stand back and ask what would enhance the value of the property already 
owned by the Irvine Co. around the airport. The answer to that is an airport." 
</P>
<P>
 Wieder said this new twist may prompt more interest in the Nov. 8 ballot 
initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think people see that everybody is getting their two cents in, so why 
shouldn't they, too?" Wieder said. "This is a time for people to determine what 
the public policy should be, because there is no faith or confidence in the 
process already established." 
</P>
<P>
 Local land-use attorney James E. Erickson, who previously worked on the El 
Toro issue, said that the initiative, if approved by voters, would be legally 
binding -- no matter who owns the land -- because it proposes a zoning 
regulation that the Board of Supervisors would have to follow. 
</P>
<P>
 What makes the situation unusual, he added, is that even before the county 
gets land-use authority of the property, the federal government can impose 
conditions on how it will be used before the transfer is made. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know that the real power lies in the County of Orange and the Department of 
Defense, and if they don't agree, nothing happens," Erickson said. "The 
initiative totally governs what the county does." 
</P>
<P>
 But Hammond disagreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "The ballot initiative is nothing but an expensive opinion poll," the Irvine 
councilman said. "There's no way it can be enforced. This ballot initiative, at 
best, would force the County of Orange to change their general plan to say 
there's an airport at El Toro. However, that has no binding effect on the 
Department of Defense." 
</P>
<P>
 Given the acrimony over one of the biggest land-use decisions facing Orange 
County, some have speculated that it might be in the federal government's best 
interest to turn the land over to the Irvine Co., even if it does not get any 
money in return. 
</P>
<P>
 The federal government hopes to sell bases to offset the environmental cleanup 
costs that come with closing them, but the relocation of the military to other 
installations and protracted legal or political fights between local factions 
threaten to delay the transfer of the property indefinitely. The proposed land 
swap, officials said, would eliminate the political hassles. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez said it was too early to speculate about the 
political fallout such a plan could trigger. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no verdict in on what the reuse of the base should be," he said. 
"It's not about winners or losers. As fast as this (proposal) came up, it could 
change next week. That has been one of the traits of the whole process. The one 
thing that I have always underscored in this process is not to underestimate 
the role of the federal government." 
</P>
<P>
 Few are publicly questioning the Irvine Co.'s motives at this point, although 
for months many involved in the issue wondered why the development giant had 
remained silent for so long, particularly since it already owns nearly all the 
land that rings the base. 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblyman Gil Ferguson (R-Newport Beach), a former vice president of the 
Irvine Co., said he remembers hearing how the company's founder became enraged 
with the federal government at the start of World War II when the company was 
forced under the War Powers Act to sell the land for $950,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's quite normal for the Irvine Co. to begin negotiations with the 
federal government," Ferguson said. "After all, the property belonged to the 
Irvine Co." 
</P>
<P>
 However, Ferguson and Assemblyman Mickey Conroy (R-Orange) said these 
negotiations may be meaningless, predicting that the Marines would never leave 
El Toro because the federal government cannot afford the move. 
</P>
<P>
 Former Irvine Mayor Larry Agran, who earlier this year suggested a slightly 
different land swap between the Irvine Co. and the federal government, 
predicted that ultimately even the latest proposal would be doomed by the sour 
politics that has dogged the base reuse issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are naysayers who would rather fight over this thing for the next 20 
years than make arrangements with a master developer to oversee development on 
a planned basis," Agran said.

COLUMN ONE; SEEKING A CURE: FAITH, FRUSTRATION; ONCE RESEARCHERS FOUND THE 
VIRUS THAT CAUSES AIDS, THEY WERE SURE THEY COULD SOON STOP THE DISEASE. 'FIND 
THE BUG, FIND THE DRUG,' THEY SAID. A DECADE LATER, THEY ARE EMPTY-HANDED AND 
THINKING OF STARTING OVER.

<P>
 Bob Gallo's black address book is filled with crossed-out names -- the names 
of the dead. 
</P>
<P>
 It has been 10 years since the controversial cancer researcher proudly 
announced to the world that he had found the virus that causes AIDS, a 
discovery for which he now shares credit with French scientists. It was a heady 
time for Gallo, and he was flush with optimism, confident that soon there would 
be a drug or a vaccine to cripple the galloping plague. 
</P>
<P>
 "Find the bug, find the drug," the theory went. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, over a glass of lager in the oak-paneled bar of New York's Plaza Hotel, 
Gallo broods about what might have gone wrong. He contemplates the destructive 
swath of a disease that, like a familiar enemy, he and countless others have 
spent too many years trying to outwit. 
</P>
<P>
 He did not expect it to be this way. 
</P>
<P>
 Villages in Africa are being wiped out. AIDS is racing through Asia, where 
more than 10 million infections are expected by the year 2000. In the United 
States, 92 people die of the disease each day. 
</P>
<P>
 For Gallo, who trained as a doctor before turning to research, there are faces 
to these numbers. He recalls having dinner last year with Jesse Dobson, a 
well-known AIDS activist. Two weeks later, Dobson was dead. 
</P>
<P>
 Another name crossed out of the black address book. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel like we should have solved problems sooner," the virologist said 
somberly. "Would've, should've, could've." 
</P>
<P>
 But didn't. Thirteen years after AIDS made its first appearance in this 
country and a decade after "the bug" was found, just a handful of drugs that 
directly attack the virus -- AZT and three others -- are on the market. None of 
them work very well, and doctors are confused about how to use them. Other new 
medicines have either been slow to emerge from drug company laboratories or 
abandoned altogether. 
</P>
<P>
 The prospects for a vaccine are equally dim. The wizards of genetic 
engineering have been unable to work their magic into a shot that prevents AIDS 
neatly and efficiently. The most promising candidates have flunked laboratory 
tests, and six volunteers who got the high-tech injections became infected 
anyway, prompting the government to abandon plans for large-scale studies. 
</P>
<P>
 The best hope for a vaccine, many scientists now say, lies with an 
old-fashioned method that uses a weakened but live form of the human 
immunodeficiency virus -- a method that paradoxically may be too dangerous to 
test in humans. This formula worked with polio. 
</P>
<P>
 But HIV is not that simple. It is a retrovirus, meaning it inserts its own 
genes into the cells of the person it infects. And it mutates rapidly, raising 
fears that a vaccine containing live virus could transform itself to infect the 
person it was supposed to protect. 
</P>
<P>
 It is no wonder then that the days of talking about a cure for AIDS are long 
gone. There isn't a cure in sight. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, as scientists gather in Yokohama, Japan, for the 10th annual 
International AIDS Conference this week, most use words such as crisis to 
describe the state of AIDS research. 
</P>
<P>
 Among researchers, a consensus has emerged: After 10 years, it is time to go 
back to the drawing board. 
</P>
<P>
 "Over the past decade, ever since the discovery of the virus, there was a 
great deal of effort put in place to see if we could quickly hit a home run," 
said virologist David Ho, director of the Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Institute 
in New York. "I think, in retrospect, that strategy is not going to work, and 
did not work." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the silver bullet Gallo once hoped for has not materialized. And 
although government and drug company scientists have spent the last decade 
trying to find one, they have yet to answer some of the most fundamental 
questions about HIV. Those answers may hold important clues to developing just 
what everyone wants -- better treatments and a vaccine. 
</P>
<P>
 "We probably know more about this virus than we do most other viruses," said 
AIDS researcher Steven Wolinsky of Northwestern University's Medical School. 
"But many of the basic issues are still begging to be answered." 
</P>
<P>
 New York AIDS activist Mark Harrington puts it a bit more bluntly. "We are 
standing," Harrington said, "at the edge of a scientific black hole." 
</P>
<P>
 Researchers do not fully understand how the AIDS virus crosses the body's 
mucous membranes -- the linings of the mouth, vagina and anus -- to infect 
cells. They do not know precisely how HIV spreads inside the body. Nor do they 
know if certain strains of the virus are more deadly than others, nor why some 
people die quickly while others live for years. 
</P>
<P>
 Also lacking is a good animal model that scientists can use to study AIDS -- a 
monkey, perhaps, or a chimp that could be infected with HIV and would develop 
the disease just as humans do. However, in Yokohama, UC San Francisco 
researcher Jay Levy is expected to report that he has solved this problem by 
using baboons. 
</P>
<P>
 These issues are the nitty-gritty of AIDS research. If AIDS had been cured by 
now, there would be no need to address them; after all, who cares about the 
intricacies of a disease that can be rendered powerless with drugs? 
</P>
<P>
 But that is not the case. And so, researchers say, they will have to learn a 
lot more about HIV -- perhaps the cagiest, most formidable of viruses -- before 
they come up with a way to conquer it. 
</P>
<P>
 To that end, the federal government is shaking up its AIDS research machine. 
Officials are planning to revamp the $1.3-billion annual AIDS budget to devote 
more money to laboratory studies -- basic research, in the lexicon of science 
-- and less to clinical research to test new treatments. 
</P>
<P>
 It will be a plodding process, and -- barring any silver bullets -- it will 
probably take decades. The Activists 
</P>
<P>
 Faced with this grim outlook, AIDS activists -- once spitting out fire and 
rage -- are downtrodden, more tired than angry. Most of the movement's fathers 
are dead, and their work has been turned over to a younger generation. 
</P>
<P>
 Marty Majchrowicz typifies this new breed -- articulate, well educated, more 
realistic than optimistic. The first time he heard about AIDS he was in the 
eighth grade and already aware of his sexual identity. He saw the disease 
featured on the cover of Time magazine, saw pictures of people dying. He 
remembers feeling scared. He remembers thinking: "I am going to die from this 
one day." 
</P>
<P>
 That was in 1981, when AIDS was still called "gay cancer." Majchrowicz 
obtained an undergraduate degree from USC and a master's degree in public 
health from UCLA. He puts his knowledge to good use, working as a treatment 
advocate at AIDS Project/Los Angeles. The slender, fair-skinned activist gives 
advice from a dimly lit office in APLA's cavernous Hollywood headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes he thinks the approved AIDS drugs -- AZT, DDI, DDC and D4T -- are no 
better than herbal remedies; the only difference is that these nucleoside 
analogues, designed to cripple the virus by keeping it from copying its genetic 
blueprint, have been tested. Looking back, he said, maybe the activists 
themselves are to blame. 
</P>
<P>
 "We forced them into a corner," Majchrowicz said, referring to scientists and 
politicians. "We told them, 'We want a drug.' They gave us AZT. They put the 
fastest thing on the market that they could. We pushed them again and we got 
DDI. So here we are screaming, 'We need drugs, we need drugs, we need drugs.' 
We screamed for something and we got it. But it wasn't good enough." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the expected survival time for someone diagnosed with AIDS has 
doubled since 1986 -- to 24 months -- this falls short of the five-year 
survival rate by which most diseases are measured. Rather, the longer survival 
time is mostly the result of better treatments for the various infections, such 
as pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, that kill people whose immune systems have 
been destroyed by AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, government tests have failed to demonstrate conclusively that the 
nucleoside analogues prolong life for more than a few months, alone or in 
combination with one another. They work for only so long and then people 
develop resistance. 
</P>
<P>
 One day, Majchrowicz knows, he will have to turn to these medicines. Like so 
many AIDS activists, he is HIV-positive. He is especially hopeful about an 
up-and-coming class of drugs -- "protease inhibitors," which attack a crucial 
enzyme that enables HIV to reproduce inside the body. It has not yet been 
approved by the Food and Drug Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, he worries that his adolescent nightmare, that he is "going to die from 
this one day," may come true before his own work does him any good. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel old," he sighs. He turned 26 in March. The Researchers 
</P>
<P>
 In a sense, the story of AIDS research is a product of a uniquely American 
belief: Science can do anything. Doctors have all the answers. 
</P>
<P>
 "For decades, and maybe even half a century, the American medical machine has 
tried . . . to put a myth over the public that everything is within our ability 
to control," said Dr. Michael Wilkes, a UCLA professor of medicine. 
</P>
<P>
 This myth has been debunked before, but faith runs deep. When President 
Richard Nixon declared a "war on cancer" in 1971, some said the cure would be 
found within five years. And when, with a beaming Gallo at her side, U.S. 
Health and Human Services Secretary Margaret Heckler announced in 1984 that the 
AIDS virus had been isolated and a vaccine would be produced within two years, 
people believed that too. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, significant strides have been made in preventing and treating certain 
types of cancers. Some childhood leukemias, for instance, have a cure rate of 
more than 80%. The advances have come as doctors learned how to put seemingly 
ineffective drugs together to work wonders. Even so, cancer remains the 
nation's second-leading cause of death. Nobody expects there will be a single 
"cure for cancer" anymore. 
</P>
<P>
 Many scientists think AIDS may follow the same pattern. 
</P>
<P>
 Among them is Dr. Harold Varmus, the new director of the National Institutes 
of Health. With an annual budget of $11 billion, NIH is the seat of medical 
research in this country. Its 17 institutes and six scientific centers and 
divisions are spread over a hilly campus in Bethesda, Md. 
</P>
<P>
 Varmus, a soft-spoken, slightly rumpled man who favors Oxford-cloth shirts and 
argyle socks, has been in charge for eight months. He speaks thoughtfully and 
candidly when asked about AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now," he said, "it's hard for me to be optimistic about feeling that 
AIDS will disappear in 20 or 30 years." But, he adds, "I do think that we will 
have drugs that are reasonably effective and that people who develop the 
disease AIDS will live a lot longer than they live now, but I think it is fair 
to say that it won't be so different than (cancer)." 
</P>
<P>
 But there is a crucial distinction, he notes, between the two diseases. The 
causes of cancer, with the exception of environmental factors such as smoking, 
diet and radon, are largely unknown. But there is nearly universal agreement 
that HIV causes AIDS. "If you could eliminate the virus, you could eliminate 
the disease," he said. Translation: "Find the bug, find the drug" should have 
worked. 
</P>
<P>
 "That," Varmus said, "is haunting us." 
</P>
<P>
 Under his watch, NIH is shaking up its AIDS bureaucracy. Four months ago, 
Varmus ousted the well-known scientist who has been the government's point man 
on AIDS since the epidemic began -- Dr. Anthony M. Fauci -- and brought in Dr. 
William E. Paul to head NIH's Office of AIDS Research. Paul is a highly 
regarded immunologist, but he has no experience in AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was looking for somebody who would inspire a lot of confidence, who would 
do new things, who was well liked," Varmus said. "I was very much attracted by 
the idea of his being somebody who was interested in AIDS but not in the middle 
of it." 
</P>
<P>
 Paul has a big job ahead. He is re-creating the Office of AIDS Research from 
the ground up; the tiny agency never had any real power until last year, when 
-- in one of the many remarkable twists that characterize AIDS research today 
-- Congress reconstituted it at the urging of activists who charged that the 
federal research program was a mess. A Litany of Complaints 
</P>
<P>
 This was nothing short of a revolution. 
</P>
<P>
 It was orchestrated by a tiny band of activists/dissenters in New York. Their 
leader was a 33-year-old former Wall Street bond trader named Peter Staley. 
Several years ago, he and his friends broke away from ACT UP, the group known 
for in-your-face protests. 
</P>
<P>
 Figuring they could accomplish more from the inside, they formed their own 
group, Treatment Action Group, or TAG. They buddied up to researchers, read 
grant abstracts and learned about funding streams. Then they issued three 
reports that caught the attention of Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) and his 
colleagues in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 The reports contained a litany of complaints: Money was being spent on studies 
that were redundant or failed to bear fruit. No one person was in charge of the 
federal AIDS budget. Top scientists in immunology and virology -- fields that 
have relevance to AIDS -- were not encouraged to join the fight. Promising 
young researchers were staying away. 
</P>
<P>
 The AIDS Clinical Trial Group, the arm of the NIH that tests AIDS drugs, had 
studied AZT and the other nucleoside analogues nine ways to Sunday and had yet 
to come up with good guidance for doctors, the reports said. (The best AZT news 
to come out of the government studies is that it helps prevent transmission 
from pregnant women to their infants.) The research effort, the group asserted, 
lacked coordination and direction. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's written off as, 'Well, that's the way science works," Staley said. "I 
don't see why it has to be that way." 
</P>
<P>
 To Staley's astonishment, Congress agreed. A New Game Plan 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, for the first time, one central authority -- the Office of AIDS 
Research -- controls federal AIDS research purse strings. With this new power, 
Paul is drafting a plan that will put more money into basic research and less 
into clinical trials. 
</P>
<P>
 The NIH spends about twice as much on clinical tests as it does on basic 
science. About 42% of the government's AIDS budget is spent developing and 
testing new drugs, and 9% is spent on vaccine research. Just 25% is devoted to 
basic laboratory work. (The remainder goes toward prevention, education and 
other activities.) 
</P>
<P>
 Paul's plan has not been made public, and in an interview, he declined to 
provide specifics, although he may do so in Yokohama. But he and Varmus 
acknowledged that change will take time. Much of the government's AIDS budget 
is locked up, committed through grants that will remain in place for the next 
three to five years. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, he is struggling to build up his staff -- a job fraught with 
obstacles because of an NIH hiring freeze -- and to familiarize himself with 
the disease he is supposed to help conquer. He has sought counsel from the 
great minds of science, among them Dr. Bernard Fields. 
</P>
<P>
 Fields is a Harvard University virologist who was a candidate for Paul's job 
but withdrew for health reasons. Like Paul, Fields has no experience in AIDS. 
At 56, he has spent three decades studying reovirus, a member of the family of 
viruses that causes diarrhea. He never got into AIDS, he said, because he did 
not want to abandon an established career. 
</P>
<P>
 In May, Fields published a commentary in the scientific journal Nature that 
brought the crisis in AIDS research to public attention. Titled "AIDS: Time to 
Turn to Basic Science," the piece reads like a blueprint for Paul to follow. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten years ago, Fields said, it was reasonable for AIDS researchers to shoot 
for the moon -- a drug, a vaccine, a cure. After all, it worked with polio: The 
first vaccine was developed by Jonas Salk long before scientists fully 
understood the virus that causes the disease. With a vaccine in hand, basic 
research into polio was all but abandoned. It wasn't necessary anymore. 
</P>
<P>
 That approach, Fields said, hasn't worked for AIDS. He argues that it is time 
to broaden AIDS research. Scientists must learn general principles about the 
immune system, he said, if they are to fully understand how AIDS attacks the 
body. 
</P>
<P>
 And the way to glean such insights, Fields said, is not necessarily to study 
HIV. Other viruses -- rotovirus, which infects the intestines, herpes virus and 
perhaps even reovirus -- might yield equally important nuggets, helping 
scientists to understand, for instance, how antibodies and other molecules work 
together to regulate immune responses. 
</P>
<P>
 He notes that it is easier to get grants for AIDS than any other disease. At 
the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, which conducts most 
of government-funded AIDS research, 14% of basic research grant requests in 
AIDS are approved. Only 8% of grant requests in other diseases are funded. The 
Skeptics 
</P>
<P>
 Not everyone thinks Fields, Paul and the Treatment Action Group activists are 
on the right track. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Robert T. Schooley is the incoming chief of the AIDS Clinical Trials 
Group. He thinks the criticisms of the AZT studies are too harsh. He worries 
that his program will be gutted just when it is on the verge of studying new 
and better classes of drugs, as well as gene therapy and other innovative 
approaches to treating AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they kill this system . . . we may end up killing trials that many of us 
think have a lot of potential," Schooley said. "Then, three years from now 
you'll have people saying, 'Why didn't we study this?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Schooley is also skeptical of Fields' argument that AIDS money should be given 
to scientists who don't work with HIV. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bernie Fields is a reovirologist," he said. "Bernie's thesis all along has 
been reovirus is a great model for AIDS. Well, HIV is a great model for AIDS. 
Reovirus is reovirus. I worry a lot about this back to the basics (philosophy) 
coming from people who would like to have funds used on what they were doing 
all their professional lives. . . . I think a lot of this is kind of 
self-serving." 
</P>
<P>
 Larry Kramer is another skeptic. The playwright and AIDS activist wrote a 
prologue to one Treatment Action Group report, calling it "one of the most 
important documents about the AIDS plague." Now he is furious with the 
organization and other activists, saying they "have become so bureaucratized as 
to be embarrassing." 
</P>
<P>
 Kramer is pushing for a "Manhattan Project" for AIDS -- a highly focused 
scientific effort like the one used to develop the atomic bomb. Cloister the 
nation's best minds out in the desert, this argument goes, and they will 
undoubtedly come up with the answer. He calls the appointment of Paul "a bad 
joke" and said the NIH is unfit to guide scientific research. 
</P>
<P>
 Although many AIDS researchers -- with the notable exception of Gallo -- think 
the "Manhattan Project" is unworkable and unnecessary, they do worry that the 
public will begin to think of AIDS as a chronic, incurable problem that goes on 
the back burner. And with it, they fear, will go the urgency -- and funding -- 
that characterized the first decade of research. 
</P>
<P>
 "This has to be viewed as a national emergency," said Ho of the Aaron Diamond 
institute. "Everyone senses there is a complacency setting in, a willingness to 
accept the situation. But this is a transmissible disease that could get worse 
if we take that attitude." An Insider's View 
</P>
<P>
 Standing outside the fracas, watching with bemused detachment, is the 
consummate AIDS insider: Anthony Fauci. 
</P>
<P>
 He has played several crucial roles in the battle against AIDS. He is director 
of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, which conducts 
40% of government-funded AIDS research. (The remainder is spread over the other 
institutes.) 
</P>
<P>
 He is a respected laboratory scientist who performs the kind of basic research 
Paul advocates. Thanks to Fauci, the theory that the AIDS virus was inactive 
after infecting people has been debunked. His research proved the virus can 
"hide" for years in the lymph nodes, multiplying rapidly before waging its 
ferocious attack. 
</P>
<P>
 And, until Paul's appointment, Fauci headed the Office of AIDS Research. 
</P>
<P>
 If anyone can take the long view of the epidemic, it is Fauci. The walls in 
his spacious office are covered with photographs that speak to his spot in the 
AIDS limelight. There is Fauci with George Bush, who once hailed him as a hero. 
There he is with Elizabeth Taylor, well known for her AIDS fund-raisers. And 
there he is peering from behind a collection of test tubes, in People magazine, 
which named him one of the "25 most intriguing people of 1990." 
</P>
<P>
 In the business of laying blame for the failures of AIDS research, Fauci has 
become an easy target. Staley, the founder of the Treatment Action Group, calls 
him "a brilliant scientist and a miserable manager." 
</P>
<P>
 Gregg Gonsalves, a founding member of the Treatment Action Group, said: "When 
Tony walks in the room, you feel like the king is here. It's like Frank 
Sinatra, the chairman of the board. Bill Paul is very collegial. Tony never 
pulled in people and said, 'OK, tell me what's wrong and how we should fix it.' 
He was stubborn and driven. . . . 'This is my epidemic and what I say goes.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Fauci has heard the criticism before, and he shrugs it off. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a natural tendency to blame," he said. "You blame the Reagan 
Administration, you blame the Bush Administration, and now people are blaming 
Bill Clinton. Except that I have been at it longer than all of them." 
</P>
<P>
 He said he pushed years ago for more basic science. But nobody wanted to hear 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wish someone would go back to my congressional testimonies when I was 
saying that we need to do more to understand how the virus works, and I was 
getting beaten up by the activists as well as the congressional committees. . . 
. Now those same people are . . . saying, 'Ah, I have seen Jesus. What we 
really need is more basic research.' No kidding." Slow Progress 
</P>
<P>
 As these debates continue, science grinds forward, step by agonizingly slow 
step. 
</P>
<P>
 On the drug frontier, pharmaceutical manufacturer Hoffman-LaRoche is seeking 
FDA permission to market its protease inhibitor under a special program that 
allows AIDS drugs to be made available to patients before they are proven 
effective. The Treatment Action Group is fighting against the approval, arguing 
that it is unfair to put another drug on the market until the company can show 
that it works. 
</P>
<P>
 Although tests of another new class of drugs -- the "tat inhibitors" -- have 
been shelved permanently, some scientists believe it will be possible to 
develop yet another type, called "integrase inhibitors." All these drugs, like 
AZT, are antiretrovirals, designed to stop the AIDS virus from multiplying 
inside the body. Each targets the virus at a different stage of its replication 
process. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, research continues on more innovative therapies. Among the most 
promising work is that being conducted by UC San Diego researcher Flossie 
Wong-Staal, who is exploring the possibility of gene therapy. In San Francisco, 
a think tank called Project Immune Restoration is bringing scientists together 
to examine ways of repairing HIV-damaged immune systems. 
</P>
<P>
 At the National Cancer Institute, Gallo and his colleagues are studying 
everything from the composition of HIV's genes to new treatments for Kaposi's 
sarcoma, a cancer that is common among AIDS patients. He is also working on an 
HIV vaccine that is being tested in France -- one of 29 vaccines in various 
stages of experimentation here and in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no telling where this effort will lead. The miracle breakthrough, the 
magic bullet, may still be just around the corner. Then again, it may not. 
</P>
<P>
 Gallo puts it this way: 
</P>
<P>
 "You could know everything about the Himalayan mountains -- evolution, caves, 
grounds, geography -- but you might not be able to climb them until somebody 
developed a new technique called a helicopter. Knowing everything there is to 
know about AIDS may not make us solve the problem. It may be unsolvable. I 
don't believe that, but that is possible. Maybe we need a whole new 
technological development from elsewhere, maybe not even from biomedical 
science. God knows from where. 
</P>
<P>
 "For some things, knowing everything may not be enough." 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, Gallo is planning his annual fall lab meeting, a seven-day 
retreat that functions as a mini-AIDS conference and is attended by the world's 
greatest scientific minds. The title of the opening talk, to be given by Nobel 
laureate and molecular biologist David Baltimore, is "AIDS Research in Crisis." 
</P>
<P>
 Each year, Gallo also invites a guest lecturer, someone from outside the 
scientific community, to deliver a provocative speech. This year's speaker is 
Pulitzer Prize-winning author Richard Rhodes. 
</P>
<P>
 He wrote "The Making of the Atomic Bomb," the definitive book on the Manhattan 
Project.

NEWS ANALYSIS; DISPUTES ABOUT ARISTIDE ADD TO DILEMMA ON HAITI; CARIBBEAN: SOME 
SEE OUSTED LEADER AS PROPHET, OTHERS AS MADMAN. CONTROVERSY COMPLICATES U.S. 
POLICY. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 To his most devoted followers, he is a latter-day Old Testament prophet whose 
jeremiads against the mistreatment of Haiti's long-suffering poor bring down 
the wrath of the Establishment, religious as well as secular. To his severest 
detractors, he is a political radical and a madman. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, almost three years after the bloody military coup that drove him from the 
presidency of Haiti, Jean-Bertrand Aristide has become a living symbol of his 
country's brief experiment with democracy -- and of one of President Clinton's 
most difficult foreign policy conundrums. 
</P>
<P>
 Under a U.N. Security Council resolution adopted July 31, Clinton has the 
authority -- should he decide to use it -- to invade Haiti and clear the way 
for Aristide to return to the presidential palace that he left in handcuffs 
Sept. 30, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, Clinton has put his faith in economic sanctions to drive out Haiti's 
military leaders. His reluctance to use force is described by Administration 
officials as prudence and derided by Aristide's supporters as an indication 
that the President is less than serious about his own policy toward an 
impoverished island republic with a mostly black population. 
</P>
<P>
 In defending the Administration's effort to oust Haiti's military dictators by 
whatever means, Clinton emphasizes traditional U.S. support for democracy. The 
growth of free societies throughout Latin America, he argues, is a fragile 
process that must be nurtured and protected as a matter of U.S. national 
interest. And he maintains that the unbuttoned brutality of the present 
military regime sows instability -- including waves of impoverished refugees -- 
in a region too close to the United States to ignore. 
</P>
<P>
 But the question of whether to risk the lives of U.S. troops to restore 
Aristide to power cannot be divorced from another puzzle: the complex, 
mystifying and often-irritating personality of the 41-year-old Roman Catholic 
priest himself. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Aristide is not a politician at all but a theologian who had spent 
years scorning politics and politicians from the pulpit. Drawing something 
bordering on adoration from Haiti's impoverished masses, he captured two of 
every three votes in what is generally regarded as the only free and fair 
election in Haiti's history. 
</P>
<P>
 His personality is immersed in mythology -- some of it clearly of his own 
making. In both Haiti and the United States, people love him or hate him, with 
very few falling in between. 
</P>
<P>
 After surviving for almost a decade as an anti-Establishment firebrand in a 
country that is among the world's leaders in per-capita political killings, 
Aristide has developed an aura of immortality. 
</P>
<P>
 In a 1985 incident that forms a central part of the Aristide mystique, the 
future president delivered a stinging denunciation of the Jean-Claude (Baby 
Doc) Duvalier dictatorship from the pulpit of the cathedral of Port-au-Prince, 
near the presidential palace. Later, a man suddenly appeared in the church and 
pointed a pistol at Aristide from close range. For a few seconds the men stared 
at each other. Then the gunman opened his revolver, removed the bullets and 
handed both to the priest. 
</P>
<P>
 To Aristide's supporters, it was a miracle. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sept. 11, 1988, thugs, almost certainly dispatched by the dictator of the 
day, Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy, burned down Aristide's church and killed at least 
12 parishioners. But Aristide escaped. 
</P>
<P>
 Between assassination attempts, Aristide preached a social gospel, emphasizing 
the Bible's warnings against mistreatment of the poor. With his words 
circulated on audiocassettes, he developed a devoted following in the slums of 
Port-au-Prince and across the impoverished countryside. 
</P>
<P>
 But as Aristide's reputation grew among the poor, Haiti's well-to-do elite 
reacted to him with fear and hatred. To the wealthy, he was a radical, a 
Communist and a menace. And the upper classes were terrified by passages in 
some of his speeches that seemed to be calls for mob justice. 
</P>
<P>
 The Catholic hierarchy joined the elite in its opposition to Aristide. Shortly 
after the 1988 fire that destroyed his church, Aristide was suspended by the 
Salesian Order, which accused him of fomenting class struggle. 
</P>
<P>
 Not all of the questions about Aristide, however, can be dismissed as 
politically motivated. He is known to be subject to wide mood swings, cited by 
detractors as evidence of madness. 
</P>
<P>
 After his church was destroyed and he was stripped of his priestly duties, for 
example, a depressed Aristide disappeared from public view for a considerable 
period of time. But to one supporter, "depression was the only sane reaction" 
to such a series of reversals. 
</P>
<P>
 To neutral U.S. observers, Aristide clearly comes off as eccentric. But judged 
from his conduct in office and later in exile, he seems to be at least as 
capable as many of today's political leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Cold War were still on, Aristide's speeches -- at least those he 
delivered before his election -- would have given U.S. policy-makers the 
willies. But as president, his policies were far more moderate than his 
rhetoric might have suggested. And, with communism in retreat around the world, 
Aristide's words seem less threatening than they once might have. 
</P>
<P>
 If it is U.S. policy to support democracy around the globe, it can hardly turn 
away from Aristide, who won a greater share of the popular vote in Haiti than, 
for example, any U.S. President since James Monroe, the nation's fifth. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, Aristide's return to power would certainly stem the unwelcome flow 
of Haitian refugees to the United States, most of whom are Aristide supporters 
facing repression by the military government. 
</P>
<P>
 If Aristide regains power, it seems inevitable that some of his supporters 
will try to even scores with the military and the Haitian elite. A blood bath 
could be a severe embarrassment to the Administration. But during Aristide's 
brief tenure, human rights violations fell far below the bloody Haitian 
standard established during earlier regimes, so there is reason to believe that 
retaliation can be kept in check. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Aristide was deposed, he has been biding his time in exile, living in a 
modern Washington apartment building and waiting for the United States to 
restore democracy to an island nation that has known only seven months of it in 
190 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if he wants to return to office behind U.S. bayonets, Aristide usually 
says the Haitian constitution prohibits him from advocating foreign 
intervention. But then he says the Haitian people want to regain democracy 
regardless of the method, so it is up to the international community to decide 
on the means. Sometimes he seems to rule out U.S. military action, while at 
other times he seems to encourage it. 
</P>
<P>
 The ambiguity of his position seems to be carefully crafted. But it leads to 
widespread misunderstanding and tends to undercut his own supporters. 
</P>
<P>
 There is some irony to Aristide's reliance on the support of the United 
States. He used to denounce "the cold country to the north" and blame it for 
most of Haiti's woes, from the grinding poverty to a constant succession of 
dictators. 
</P>
<P>
 In the years that preceded his election, Aristide's rhetoric was often 
anti-American. Critics on Capitol Hill such as Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) 
frequently quote Aristide's verbal excesses as evidence that he is not a person 
Washington should help or trust. While in office and later in exile, however, 
Aristide softened his criticism of U.S. policy. 
</P>
<P>
 Randall Robinson, executive director of the TransAfrica think tank and a 
devoted Aristide supporter who earlier this year staged a hunger strike on his 
behalf, says Aristide's rhetoric was understandable in light of U.S. 
involvement in Haitian history, which includes an invasion and a 19-year 
occupation starting in 1915. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is not surprising that sane people representing the poor in Haiti would 
use rhetoric that might sound to Americans to be anti-American," Robinson said. 
"If this Administration succeeds in restoring democracy in Haiti, that, for the 
first time, puts a new page in this book. I would assume that on that occasion, 
President Aristide would respond differently." 
</P>
<P>
 The George Bush Administration clearly was displeased by Aristide's election 
victory, unenthusiastic about him in office and, following his ouster, 
ambivalent in its support for his restoration. Although the Administration 
voted for a resolution in the Organization of American States denouncing the 
coup, Bush did nothing to reverse it. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton has been far more outspoken in his support of Aristide's cause. But 
Lawrence A. Pezzullo, the veteran diplomat who coordinated the Administration's 
Haiti policy until he resigned April 22, has become increasingly critical of 
Aristide. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was catapulted into the presidency and formed a mediocre and partisan 
government," Pezzullo said. "He didn't understand the governing process, and 
the people around him didn't either. You need a man of tremendous skill to put 
together a reform program. He couldn't do that. If you talk to him about 
programs, he is bereft of any concept of policy." 
</P>
<P>
 But it misses the point to regard Aristide as a conventional politician. 
</P>
<P>
 After years of heaping scorn on politics and politicians from the pulpit, 
Aristide entered the 1990 election at the last minute and swept to victory on 
votes of the impoverished masses. It was the first time the poor had been given 
a fair shot at the ballot box, and they made the most of it. 
</P>
<P>
 In office, Aristide tried to pare Haiti's bloated public payroll, and he 
cooperated with an International Monetary Fund austerity program that had drawn 
complaints from leftist political parties. His administration was stifled from 
the start by political gridlock in Parliament. U.S. supporters admit that he 
was unable to enact a single piece of legislation during his seven-month 
tenure. 
</P>
<P>
 Pezzullo, who tried without success to pressure Aristide to form an alliance 
with opposition parliamentarians to broaden his political base, said the ousted 
president will be unable to govern even if he regains his office. 
</P>
<P>
 "He never had a majority in the Parliament and it is a parliamentary system, 
not a presidential system," Pezzullo said in reference to the Haitian 
constitution, which remains theoretically in force although it is generally 
ignored by the military government. "What I'm concerned about is the larger 
political comity that you develop through the major political activists so you 
have a coalition government, which is the only way you can govern there. He 
gives no indication of wanting to develop that." 
</P>
<P>
 Burton V. Wides, a Washington lawyer representing Aristide, said the ousted 
president broke with parliamentarians who ran with him as part of an electoral 
coalition over matters of "patronage and pork." He said Aristide intentionally 
declined to convert his mass support into a political organization. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Aristide took up his exile residence in Washington, he has generated 
support and opposition almost as emotional as the feelings he produced at home. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, Rep. Joseph Kennedy (D-Mass.) first encountered Aristide when he 
traveled to Port-au-Prince to attend the inauguration primarily because of the 
novelty of a democratically elected president in a country that had known 
little but dictators. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was one of the most exciting political dramas that I have ever seen," said 
Kennedy, whose family knows something about political charisma. "I have seldom 
seen so many people so united and so excited about a political leader." 
</P>
<P>
 But Helms, the North Carolina Republican who has led opposition to Aristide on 
Capitol Hill, calls him "a demonstrable killer." 
</P>
<P>
 "This cruel man has made fiery speeches exhorting his followers to use the 
necklace method, as it is called, to destroy his political enemies in agony," 
Helms said in reference to mob execution in which a gasoline-soaked tire is 
forced over the victim's head and shoulders and set afire. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no doubt that Aristide made inflammatory speeches that easily can be 
read as advocating execution by necklace. But the State Department's Human 
Rights report shows that political killings and rights violations were far 
lower during Aristide's tenure than they were under the military dictatorships 
that preceded and followed it.

SIMPSON CASE HEIGHTENS STAKES IN 'DNA WAR'; COURTS: DEFENSE WILL ARGUE MERITS 
OF TESTING RESULTS EITHER WAY. IT IS ONE OF THE MOST VITRIOLIC DEBATES IN LAW, 
MEDICINE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM NEWTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As scientists perform the tests that could alter the course of the O.J. 
Simpson murder case, the former football star's attorneys are constructing two 
parallel defense strategies -- one for whatever results the DNA analysis 
produces. 
</P>
<P>
 If the tests show that Simpson's blood does not match that of samples found at 
the scene of the crime, two of the nation's foremost criminalists, Dr. Henry 
Lee and Dr. Michael Baden, will be prepared to argue that someone other than 
Simpson is almost certainly the killer. 
</P>
<P>
 But if the tests indicate that Simpson's DNA matches that of samples recovered 
by detectives, his lawyers are ready for that too. They have hired Barry Scheck 
and Peter Neufeld, two of the nation's premier legal experts on the 
shortcomings of DNA evidence and the limits of its usefulness in identifying 
criminal suspects. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a good team assembled that can deal with any set of results," said 
Johnnie L. Cochran Jr., one of the leading members of Simpson's defense team. 
"We can cover it both ways." 
</P>
<P>
 No matter which DNA faction of Simpson's team gets the call, the experts and 
lawyers who square off to argue DNA will be wading into one of the most 
vitriolic debates in the legal and medical communities today. It is a highly 
technical area where biology and statistics converge, and it has pitted the 
operators of forensic labs against academic scientists in a furious 
disagreement over how DNA tests are performed and whether they are reliable 
enough to send defendants to prison in certain cases. 
</P>
<P>
 The raging debate over DNA is complicated further by shifting legal standards 
for considering scientific evidence in court. In 1993, the U.S. Supreme Court 
adopted new rules for judges to employ in admitting scientific evidence, but 
those rules only apply in the federal courts. Legal experts are eagerly 
awaiting word on the subject from the California Supreme Court, whose rulings 
bind state judges such as the one presiding over the Simpson case. 
</P>
<P>
 All of that could give Superior Court Judge Lance A. Ito a huge problem to 
sort out. Since he was assigned to the case last month, Ito has broached the 
DNA issue once and will return to it Tuesday when he is expected to hear 
arguments about splitting blood samples. 
</P>
<P>
 As the case goes forward, he could have bigger dilemmas before him. Experts 
say it could take weeks for Ito to hear conflicting testimony about the DNA, 
then to decide whether the tests are admissible and, finally, to determine how 
much statistical significance jurors should attach to any possible DNA "match." 
</P>
<P>
 All those decisions could have important consequences for the case, and Ito 
will have few hard-and-fast rules to guide him. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nothing is nailed down here," said John Wiley, a UCLA law professor and 
former federal prosecutor. "Judge Ito really has got a nightmare on his hands." 
</P>
<P>
 The forum in the explosive Simpson case will be what is known as a "Frye 
hearing," a dry, technical and possibly prolonged session that will focus on 
contested evidence in the case and which Ito has indicated he intends to 
conduct after a jury is impaneled. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither side in the DNA war disputes the central scientific premise behind the 
process -- that different people have different DNA structures, and that DNA 
testing can therefore identify or exclude people as the sources of blood, hair 
or tissue samples. 
</P>
<P>
 Even a skeptic such as Scheck has said that DNA testing is "an extraordinarily 
powerful tool that is going to be done reliably." But, he added: "Has it yet 
become reliable? No." 
</P>
<P>
 Egged on by rival lawyers, scientists have staged an increasingly testy 
disagreement on that subject, accusing colleagues of faking results, stealing 
others' work and slanting experiments for money. The debate has grown so heated 
that one expert titled his article on the subject "Lessons From the DNA War" 
and lists among his credentials the fact that one of his articles has been 
reprinted three times and plagiarized once. 
</P>
<P>
 Some scientists say they have been threatened with income tax audits or 
investigations into their immigration status after testifying in DNA cases. 
Others who have been through the experience describe it as "harrowing" and have 
vowed never to take the stand again. 
</P>
<P>
 "These cases have forced the adversarial process into the scientific process," 
said Deborah Williamson, an assistant federal public defender from Phoenix who 
has waged an aggressive challenge to DNA evidence on behalf of a client. 
"Scientists are not used to being challenged and picked at. It's gotten pretty 
mean." 
</P>
<P>
 Few expect the Simpson case to prove an exception. No eyewitnesses to the 
murders of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Lyle Goldman have come forward, and 
Simpson has vigorously maintained his innocence, saying through his attorneys 
that he was at home at the time of the killings. So DNA evidence is likely to 
form an important element of the prosecution's effort to show that Simpson was 
at the scene of the crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Preliminary DNA tests conducted by the Los Angeles Police Department lab in 
June showed that Simpson could have left blood droplets leading away from the 
murder scene, and that blood found on a glove outside his Brentwood mansion 
could have come from the two victims. 
</P>
<P>
 Those tests were not presented during last month's preliminary hearing. 
Prosecutors instead relied on results of conventional blood testing done on a 
droplet discovered at the murder scene -- results that a police expert 
testified pointed to Simpson as a likely source of the drop. Since the hearing, 
prosecutors have sent their blood samples to a Maryland laboratory, Cellmark 
Diagnostics, where scientists are performing more rigorous DNA tests known as 
restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis. 
</P>
<P>
 That procedure is the most commonly accepted by courts, but it too has come 
under assault in numerous trials. Leading the attack often is the tag team of 
Scheck and Neufeld, a highly regarded pair of attorneys who pioneered the 
defense bar's challenges to DNA in the late 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I was the defense, there isn't anybody else I would call," said Myrna 
Raeder, a professor at Southwestern University School of Law. "Barry is 
incredibly well-respected. . . . In the mid-1980s, nobody was challenging DNA 
at all. Then Barry took a look at it and started talking to scientists. He 
almost single-handedly, with Peter Neufeld, started this debate." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the earliest milestone cases in the DNA war was one known as People vs. 
Castro. On Feb. 5, 1987, a 20-year-old pregnant New York woman and her 
2-year-old daughter were found stabbed to death in the Bronx. A janitor named 
Joseph Castro was charged with the murders, and prosecutors offered as evidence 
a bloodstain from his watch. 
</P>
<P>
 That stain, according to DNA experts, matched the blood of the dead mother. 
They concluded that the chances of it having come from anyone else were more 
than 189-million-to-1. 
</P>
<P>
 The lab in that case was New York-based Lifecodes, and its findings were 
backed by a number of prominent scientists. But Scheck and Neufeld fought back 
vigorously, suggesting that the lab's procedures were sloppy and that analysts 
had ignored data that might tend to clear the defendant. Some experts who 
originally testified for Lifecodes eventually reconsidered and joined in the 
criticism. 
</P>
<P>
 After an exhaustive Frye hearing, the judge ruled that the evidence of the 
victim's blood on Castro's watch could not be admitted. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Castro case, which might have been an unmitigated victory for critics 
of DNA testing, ended on an eerie note. Having successfully fought to keep the 
DNA evidence out of court, Castro then pleaded guilty to the crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Since that case, Frye hearings have become the increasingly fractious testing 
grounds over the admissibility of DNA evidence and the reliability of the 
principal DNA laboratories, Lifecodes and Cellmark. 
</P>
<P>
 Both laboratories have steadfastly defended their work and noted that results 
of their tests have been accepted in courts nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 Acceptance has not come without a fight, though. In case after case, Scheck 
and Neufeld have attacked both labs for sloppy work -- Neufeld once accused 
Lifecodes of producing "garbage" -- and have questioned the statistical 
significance of DNA "matches." 
</P>
<P>
 To arrive at the odds of two "matching" samples coming from different sources, 
analysts perform a simple arithmetic exercise. Say there are three 
characteristics in a given DNA sample and each one occurs in the general 
population with a frequency of 1 in every 10 people. By multiplying the odds of 
a person having each characteristic, analysts might conclude that there was a 
1-in-1,000 chance of a single person having all three characteristics. 
(Multiplying .10 x .10 x .10 produces a result of .001 or 1 in 1,000.) 
</P>
<P>
 Proponents of DNA testing say presenting the jury with those statistics helps 
allow jurors to assess the likelihood of samples coming from the same or 
different people. But critics say there is a hitch: Imagine that the three 
characteristics being studied reflect the coding for black hair, dark eyes and 
dark skin. And imagine that sample came from an Indian reservation in Arizona 
or New Mexico. The sample could be linked to far more people in that population 
than the 1-in-1,000 ratio would indicate. 
</P>
<P>
 To avoid that, analysts study segments of DNA that are believed to be highly 
individual, avoiding sections that code for hair or eye color, for instance. 
Nevertheless, critics say the statistical significance of a DNA match can vary 
by region, by the specific characteristics being studied and by the population 
from which the sample is drawn. 
</P>
<P>
 All those factors complicate any statistical conclusions about the sample's 
significance, even if a "match" is produced. 
</P>
<P>
 Assuming Cellmark's tests withstand any quality control challenges from the 
defense, most legal experts believe that Ito will allow jurors to hear DNA 
evidence in the Simpson case. But Peter Arenella, a UCLA law professor, echoed 
the view of other experts in predicting that Ito probably will force 
prosecutors to use conservative estimates when it comes to assessing the 
probability that any DNA sample can be matched to Simpson or the victims. 
</P>
<P>
 That could narrow the field of possible suspects but also leave the Simpson 
defense team with room to maneuver. At the preliminary hearing, a police expert 
said conventional blood tests demonstrated that a blood drop found at the crime 
scene could only have come from about one in every 200 people -- including 
Simpson. 
</P>
<P>
 Gerald F. Uelmen, one of Simpson's lawyers, pounced on that statistic to note 
that tens of thousands of people in the Los Angeles area thus could have left 
the drop. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, moreover, even if the DNA evidence shows everything that 
prosecutors hope it will, their case would still be incomplete. 
</P>
<P>
 The onetime football superstar is charged with two counts of first-degree 
murder, a charge that requires prosecutors to prove premeditation. 
</P>
<P>
 Doing that will require prosecutors to produce old-fashioned evidence such as 
testimony about a defendant's statements to police, behavior before and after 
the crimes and relationship to the victims. Assessing Simpson's premeditation 
forces jurors to venture inside the Hall of Famer's head. And there, even DNA 
cannot lead them. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the most, DNA can link you to a killing," said Harland W. Braun, a noted 
criminal defense lawyer in Los Angeles. "It doesn't do anything beyond that. To 
get to premeditation or intent, the prosecution is going to have to do more, 
and it's going to have to rely on other kinds of evidence."

IN KATALE CAMP, DIRT, DISEASE AND DESPAIR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN BALZAR, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Morning arrives swiftly in equatorial Africa. There is hardly a sunrise before 
a gray-white glow illuminates the sky like a dirty fluorescent bulb. 
</P>
<P>
 But the sky itself is barely visible. 
</P>
<P>
 Right now, Zairian farmers are burning brush lands so the grass will grow 
green in the coming rainy season. Not far from the highway, the flat-topped 
volcano Nyiragongo spews its gases. Powdery dust rises with every relief 
convoy, every footstep. And, of course, green-sapling smoke coils from hundreds 
of thousands of morning campfires. 
</P>
<P>
 The air has substance to it, and grit, a pallor of poison on these lowlands, 
where squeezed together is one of the greatest and swiftest-moving 
concentrations of refugees the world has known. Their flight now halted, they 
swarm over this corner of impoverished Zaire, most of them herded into a few 
epic camps radiating out of the dingy town of Goma. 
</P>
<P>
 Katale is one such camp, with forbidding ground on which perhaps 250,000 
Rwandan refugees huddle. Some estimates put the number at 400,000; others say 
200,000. Other camps clustered here push the total of despair to 1 million, 
more or less. A plane flew overhead Saturday and tried to make a count: 900,000 
total. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our life is horrible and it is getting worse," says Idephouse Bagamuayese, a 
28-year-old ethnic Hutu who has claimed his puny yardage on a high spot. At one 
time, one can imagine his face was fierce and proud. Now it is just sweaty, his 
eyes rimmed with pus. Here, one is 40 miles from Goma, 40 miles and 500 yards 
from Rwanda. One is in the midst of mass murderers and mass victims alike. Last 
month, many among these mostly Hutu refugees were hysterical killers hacking up 
rival ethnic Tutsis with machetes. Today, they are docile, dirty, defeated, 
diseased and dying. 
</P>
<P>
 In the camp's morning light, a stranger's eyes sting. But that is nothing 
compared to the smell. The world has seen the pictures, but what can pictures 
tell of the stench that brews from multitudes of unwashed people compressed in 
the tropics along with putrefying corpses, ponds of raw excrement and urine, 
endless spreading pestilence, dirt and fear? These are malodors absorbed like 
grease into the skin, and no one gets used to them. 
</P>
<P>
 To enter such a camp is to enter a world of suffering. One must step over the 
reclining to talk to the standing. And the standing are swept along by the 
moving. The dying get little sympathy. The dead are obstacles. 
</P>
<P>
 There are running sores, running noses and a communal wet coughing in the air. 
Disease is spread by close contact, doctors warn. Disease is spread by filthy 
conditions. And Katale camp is nourishing microbiology's worst. 
</P>
<P>
 Cholera is declining but still prevalent. Shigella dysentery is spreading. 
Just this weekend, pneumonia began a furious strike on the weak of the camp, 
especially the children. Measles and meningitis are creeping into the huts. 
That old killer malaria is taking its toll, with more to come in the impending 
rainy season. 
</P>
<P>
 And at the French-operated hospital in Goma, one-third of the patients test 
positive for the virus that causes AIDS -- or, more to the point here, that 
weakens the immune system against other assaults. 
</P>
<P>
 Bagamuayese is trying to make a life for himself in the squalor. He is selling 
banana beer from a six-gallon plastic fuel can, dirty and yellow. For 30 cents, 
he will fill a castoff quart bottle with the fast-fermented brew. His future is 
vested in his collection of eight scratched bottles, eight bamboo straws and a 
5-by-8-foot thatched shack barely tall enough to squat in. 
</P>
<P>
 "Life, I tell you, is very difficult," he says. "But I can do nothing about 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 Bagamuayese used to build houses in Byumba in northern Rwanda. He carried his 
beer bottles more than 100 miles. He was robbed once on the long march. No, 
camp life is not settling down. "Nothing here can be normal." 
</P>
<P>
 Enter the hovel of Alexander Tulikumana, a former machinist in a Kigali tool 
factory. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sorry I have no chairs," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 He lives with three others in a 10-by-10-foot hut, framed by saplings and 
covered with wrinkled black plastic sheeting. The floor is a powdery volcanic 
flour, but Tulikumana is a rich man here -- he has a nice tropical shirt and a 
small portable radio, three pots and a basket. And shoes. 
</P>
<P>
 His tent is spaced 18 inches from tents on three sides, with four feet extra 
in front for cooking. The camp goes on like this, tent after hut after blanket, 
18 inches apart, over one hill, and another, on and on in every direction as 
far as the eye can see. 
</P>
<P>
 "My wife was a Tutsi. She was killed. My two children, killed. . . . No, I 
don't know who did it," Tulikumana says. "I'll stay here until we are assured 
it is safe to go back. . . . Maybe two years, if I have to. What else can I do? 
. . . The future is in forgetting all that happened. If there is a future." 
</P>
<P>
 According to relief workers, camps like Katale are tightly organized even 
though the scene appears wild and chaotic. People are encamped by prefecture, 
just as they lived in Rwanda. Village politicians and the murderous militia who 
ran Rwanda now run affairs here. They distribute the food; they watch over 
interviews to maintain the party line: Don't go home; you will have your eyes 
taken out by the victorious Rwandan Patriotic Front that now controls the 
country; we refugees will never go home until our old Hutu-dominated government 
tells us to; the nations of the West must force negotiations between the old 
and new governments. 
</P>
<P>
 "I listen to my radio for good news," Tulikumana says. 
</P>
<P>
 Has there been any? 
</P>
<P>
 "No." 
</P>
<P>
 This is high-altitude country. Not far away are the jungle mountains that 
provide the last habitat for the mountain gorilla. Katale camp, like the 
others, was scraped and trampled out of coarse volcanic lava flows, only yards 
from the boundary of Virunga National Park, home to elephants and other 
wildlife. On this morning, a group of baboons crosses the road outside the 
camp, snarling and baring their fangs. 
</P>
<P>
 The property that is not parkland is cultivated with banana and coffee 
plantations, with scattered groves of vine-draped trees. People who venture out 
of the camps wisely beat the path in front of them to ward off snakes. 
</P>
<P>
 In the outlying forest, the temperature may be 75 degrees. But in the caldron 
of Katale it is 15 degrees hotter. And inside Tulikumana's plastic sweat house, 
it is easily over 100 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
 He wishes to explain the war that brought him here. His Hutu president died in 
a still-mysterious airplane crash April 6. "He told the Hutus not to kill the 
Tutsi and to make it a country for all. But he was betrayed. They killed him," 
he says. "Then, the Hutus got angry." 
</P>
<P>
 Angry enough for the Hutus to slaughter up to half a million of their 
countrymen. But their army was outmaneuvered and outgunned in a short, sharp 
revolution, and 2.2 million fled, half here to the vicinity of Goma. And now, 
perhaps 25,000 have died from disease, 700 to 900 more each day. And 
reconciliation seems laughably implausible. 
</P>
<P>
 Rwandans fled with what little money they had and what possessions they could 
carry. So Katale has now become a primitive bazaar. 
</P>
<P>
 A shoe repairman works with a needle and dental floss on the paper-thin sole 
of a sandal. One boy displays his wares: a single D-cell battery and a 
water-stained pack of cigarettes. On a rag, a woman offers six potatoes as a 
deathly ill man lies at her side. One man is selling four pairs of shoes and 
two mismatched singles. A piece of paper is lashed to a stick and says "Radio," 
the only advertisement that could be seen over the hundreds of acres. But the 
radio repairman is nowhere to be seen. "Maybe he died," says an impassive 
teen-ager. 
</P>
<P>
 Much has been reported about the dead in this horrible scene, perhaps so much 
as to numb the senses. 
</P>
<P>
 But they will not go away. On this morning, fresh batches line the road at 
Katale -- six here all wrapped in mats, four a little farther on, some naked. A 
dozen more a little farther still. 
</P>
<P>
 Young men ride in blue trucks to collect the bodies. But two hours after the 
morning collection, a fresh row of corpses appears. 
</P>
<P>
 A man steps over a body to get his hair cut by a woman who has opened a barber 
stand with a bucket and a 10-inch pair of shears. A woman in a colorful but 
darkly soiled African wrap lays down a small child encased in dirty cloth, and 
shuffles away. A man emerges from the sea of people and leaves a corpse -- 
maybe his mother, maybe his wife. He blends back into the throng with no more 
visible emotion than he would dropping off a pail of water. 
</P>
<P>
 But emotions are building in the camp. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the weekend, aid workers began carrying walkie-talkies. They travel in 
teams and check in according to fixed schedules. None has reported attacks from 
refugees, but they say they are concerned. The weakest of the refugees have 
died. The strong survive. 
</P>
<P>
 Here and there, journalists, particularly American journalists, encounter 
angry men who shout and chase them away. Many in these camps have been told by 
Hutu leaders that Americans are supporting the Tutsis, as the Europeans did 
throughout this part of Africa for many years. 
</P>
<P>
 There are no police in this camp. Zairian soldiers roam the perimeters but do 
not venture deep inside. Frequently they rob refugees of what little they have. 
The United Nations calls them a source of disorder. Relief supplies are flowing 
into Goma by road and air at a furious pace, but distribution remains uneven. 
Some areas have plenty of water, but others require a hike of several miles. 
</P>
<P>
 Women do that hard work -- balancing 45-pound cans for the sweaty daylong trip 
to get the water they hope will not kill them. They tear through the forests of 
young trees, cutting down acres in a day for firewood. Many of the forests are 
young here, because the volcano Nyiragongo buried the lowlands in lava just six 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Cattle and goats are herded through the camp, among the most precious 
possessions of all. At midday, several are led to a bloody pit -- the camp 
slaughterhouse, where they are butchered in the sun under a cloud of flies. 
Most of the pots, however, have no meat. They bubble with a watery gray gruel 
made of relief supplies. 
</P>
<P>
 The smell, the teeming crush, the sickness, the pawing children who want only 
attention, the long fast slide from civilization churn up a dizziness that no 
Dramamine can prevent. The impulse to flee climbs up the neck. 
</P>
<P>
 So a visitor climbs into a dirty car, engulfed by refugees. The driver 
screeches on the horn; he zigs and zags to avoid a pickup truck carrying 
perhaps 35 people. But the way is blocked by a pile of lava boulders. 
</P>
<P>
 From out of the crowd two skinny, barefoot boys in filthy rags dart forth. 
Together they lift the razor-sharp rocks from the car's path and then instantly 
blend back into the crowd. Inexplicably, those in so much need of help still 
found help to give.

FINAL PUSH ON HEALTH BY CLINTON DUE; CONGRESS: WHITE HOUSE SHIFTS FOCUS TO 
'BEST DEAL' POSSIBLE. THE PRESIDENT WILL MAKE LAST-DITCH EFFORT TO RETAIN 
EMPLOYER MANDATE SECTION OF MITCHELL BILL. BUT HE IS SAID TO BE IN A 
'COMPROMISING MODE.' 
</P>

<P>
 President Clinton is resigned to salvaging whatever he can get from Congress 
on health care reform, but he is preparing to launch a last-ditch effort to 
save a key provision of a Senate bill that could eventually require large 
employers to insure their workers, Administration officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The mood at the White House definitely has shifted from 'all or nothing,' to 
'let's take the best deal we can get,' " said one senior Clinton aide who spoke 
on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
 The priority at the White House is an all-out push for passage of the 
compromise health care bill crafted by Senate Majority Leader George J. 
Mitchell (D-Me.). The Clinton team is particularly anxious to preserve the 
provision that would trigger the so-called employer mandate in any state where 
less than 95% of the population enjoys health care coverage by the year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're in two phases now in the campaign. First, we want to get a vote on the 
trigger," the senior aide said. "We're behind by several votes but trying to 
build enough pressure to win it. A vote for the trigger would steady the bill. 
</P>
<P>
 "But if it's voted down, the President wants to get whatever he can get -- and 
that's the second phase," the aide said. 
</P>
<P>
 Another White House aide agreed that the President is in a "compromising 
mode." 
</P>
<P>
 The present White House stance is light-years away from the heady days of last 
winter, when First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton and her health policy guru, Ira 
Magaziner, led a highly publicized effort to redesign the nation's medical care 
system from top to bottom. Back then, the "policy wonk" was king; no element of 
medical care was too obscure, no proposal too ambitious for Administration 
officials and their army of experts to take up. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the experts are on the sidelines, and the political deal-makers are at 
center court. 
</P>
<P>
 Administration officials insist that the President has not abandoned 
everything he and the First Lady once held dear. They say he will not accept a 
health care bill that appears too flawed to work properly. "He won't take just 
anything," the senior aide said. "There are some scenarios that could make the 
health care situation worse; so it would have to be prudent." 
</P>
<P>
 The President has stressed that incremental reforms seeking only to ban 
discriminatory insurance industry practices but not moving the nation toward 
guaranteed health coverage could increase the number of uninsured while driving 
up prices for everyone else. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the need for a President with sagging poll ratings to obtain something he 
can call a victory on health care would be hard to exaggerate. And the 
political realities in Congress are rapidly narrowing the Administration's 
range to maneuver. 
</P>
<P>
 Initially, White House strategists had hoped to secure House passage of a 
health care blueprint that is more ambitious than Mitchell's Senate version. 
Then, they thought, a consensus bill falling somewhere in between could be 
negotiated in the House-Senate conference committee that will resolve 
differences between whatever measures emerge from each chamber. 
</P>
<P>
 That scenario still could materialize. But by embracing Mitchell's bill, as he 
did in a prime-time press conference Wednesday, the President may have 
seriously undercut the House bill, which is championed by Majority Leader 
Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.) and tracks closely on Clinton's own ideas. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the President's proposal, which would have required employers to pay at 
least 80% of workers' health insurance premiums, Mitchell's plan would require 
them to pay only 50%. The bill exempts small businesses with fewer than 25 
employees from the mandate. 
</P>
<P>
 Gephardt's bill requires employers to provide 80% of the cost of an employee's 
health insurance. That mandate is bitterly opposed by many businesses, most 
Republican lawmakers and even some moderate Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
 Many House Democrats were spooked by Clinton's ready endorsement of Mitchell's 
voluntary approach, with its standby employer mandate. They view the prospect 
of a vote in the House on the mandate as a needless political risk because it 
appears the Senate at most will adopt a watered-down version of workplace-based 
insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 A Clinton aide acknowledged that the President's words left some Democrats in 
the House shaking their heads, and asking: "If the President wants the Mitchell 
bill, why should we vote for the Gephardt bill?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody here's in an uproar," Rep. Patricia Schroeder (D-Colo.) said in an 
interview last week. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think you might see . . . we'll cut out everything (from) Gephardt and slip 
in Mitchell," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell's proposal, Clinton said during his press conference, is "the most 
ambitious bill" that could win Senate passage. It "says to the people who have 
not been supportive of our approach: 'Look, we'll try it in a competitive way 
first, and if that doesn't work, then we'll have a requirement.' " 
</P>
<P>
 During the past year, as comprehensive health care reform faced an 
increasingly uphill battle, the President has gradually retreated from the 
uncompromising position that he defined during his State of the Union Address 
on Jan. 25. 
</P>
<P>
 During that speech to a joint session of Congress, Clinton dramatically 
brandished a pen and vowed to veto any bill that did not "guarantee every 
American private health insurance." 
</P>
<P>
 The next morning, Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen said the White House was 
willing to back off on another controversial proposal in the President's plan: 
creation of insurance-buying "alliances" that most consumers and employers 
would be required to join. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton has repeatedly argued that an employer mandate would be the most 
conservative and efficient way of reaching universal coverage, because most 
Americans now get their coverage through employer-provided insurance. Moreover, 
a mandate could quickly extend coverage to millions of Americans who now lack 
it because more than 80% of the 39 million uninsured people are workers and 
their dependents. 
</P>
<P>
 But the employer mandate generated a firestorm on Capital Hill, and its 
chances of passage dimmed as the year wore on. 
</P>
<P>
 Last spring, when congressional committees began considering their own 
alternatives to Clinton's health care agenda, lawmakers broached the 
possibility of passing a reform bill that would rely on voluntary measures to 
expand coverage and rein in health care costs. 
</P>
<P>
 The movement gained critical momentum after the Congressional Budget Office 
and a number of private analysts said purely voluntary approaches could 
increase coverage from roughly 85% of the population today to more than 90% 
after several years. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, there has been increasing recognition -- fanned in part by White 
House officials -- that the President's bottom-line goal of universal coverage 
would not necessarily provide benefits to 100% of the population. 
</P>
<P>
 The President himself said increasing coverage to 95% might be sufficient, 
couching his words in a talk to the National Governors' Assn. that was widely 
interpreted as a signal of his willingness to settle for a plan that did not 
cover "every American." 
</P>
<P>
 In embracing both the Gephardt and Mitchell bills, the President also could be 
open to charges that he has changed his tune on other key tenets of his reform 
agenda. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Clinton has repeatedly pushed for "private health insurance" for 
everyone, Gephardt's bill would vastly expand Medicare, potentially enrolling 
tens of millions of additional Americans in the federally run health insurance 
program for the elderly. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the White House has strongly criticized a competing proposal by 
Rep. Jim Cooper (D-Tenn.) for, among other things, deferring to a national 
health board the controversial task of defining the elements of a standard 
benefits package. 
</P>
<P>
 That, it turns out, is also the approach being advocated by Mitchell. 
</P>
<P>
 Floor debate on health care legislation is scheduled to begin in the Senate 
this week and in the House the following week. Clinton aides say the President 
is willing to forgo his summer vacation at Martha's Vineyard, Mass., if 
necessary, and to remain in Washington until Congress passes a bill he feels he 
can sign. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell said last week that he intends to keep the Senate in session six days 
a week, 12 hours a day, for "however long it takes" to complete action on 
health care reform. The Senate had been scheduled to begin a monthlong summer 
vacation at the end of this week. 
</P>
<P>
 The House is scheduled to begin its debate on Aug. 15, and Speaker Thomas S. 
Foley (D-Wash.) said he hopes to bring the legislation to a vote by Aug. 19. 
</P>
<P>
 Exactly what that legislation will contain is now more uncertain than ever. 
But one thing seems clear, whatever it provides, the President is likely to 
applaud.

ALLIES EXULT AS BOSNIAN SERBS SURRENDER ARMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TYLER MARSHALL and CAROL J. WILLIAMS, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Frequently over the past months, senior officials at NATO headquarters here 
have privately exhibited growing frustration at the failure of the United 
Nations to defend the weapons exclusion zones it declared in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. Saturday, that frustration had vanished. 
</P>
<P>
 Within hours of NATO's air strike Friday against Bosnian Serb weaponry 
operating in the U.N.-declared exclusion zone around the capital, Sarajevo, a 
Bosnian Serb political leader promised to give back heavy weapons his forces 
had stolen from a U.N. depot. Then the rebels actually returned them. 
</P>
<P>
 By late Saturday, the U.N. Protection Force reported that Bosnian Serb forces 
had handed back a Soviet-built T-55 tank, two armored personnel carriers and a 
Praga antiaircraft gun stolen early the previous day from a Sarajevo 
containment yard being guarded by a U.N. peacekeeping unit from Ukraine. 
</P>
<P>
 A fifth weapon, an antiaircraft gun taken in a separate raid on a U.N. site, 
was also returned for U.N. safekeeping, mission spokesman Maj. Rob Annink told 
reporters in Sarajevo. 
</P>
<P>
 While deep concern persists over widespread truce violations and the Balkan 
war's potential to spread, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization air strike 
requested Friday by the U.N. Protection Force appeared to put Bosnian Serb 
belligerents on notice that the international community will not tolerate a 
resumption of the siege of Sarajevo. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the rebels' longtime patron, Serbia, has apparently taken a hard line 
with the insurgents. 
</P>
<P>
 Rump Yugoslavia, made up of Serbia and Montenegro, severed all political and 
economic ties with the Bosnian Serbs on Thursday and closed its border to 
commercial traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, Serbian border police turned back hundreds of trucks, many 
carrying food, trying to cross into Bosnian Serb territory, Reuters news 
service reported. 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, the allies' showdown was an isolated victory over the Bosnian 
Serbs, who continue their flagrant violations of the exclusion zones and 
already possess a colossal predominance in arms over the Muslim-led government 
forces. 
</P>
<P>
 At least six mortar rounds have been fired by the rebels into Sarajevo 
civilian neighborhoods over the past week -- an ominous reminder of how easily 
the siege that terrorized the capital for 22 months could be restarted. 
</P>
<P>
 Sniper fire from Bosnian Serb positions just across the Miljacka River in 
central Sarajevo has so intensified since the rebels spurned an international 
peace proposal July 19 that at least a dozen people have been killed or wounded 
and service on the city's tram network, which was restored in March to the 
cheers and tears of long-deprived Sarajevans, has been suspended more often 
than not. 
</P>
<P>
 But U.N. peacekeeping officials in Bosnia seemed eager to take advantage of 
the boost in credibility that Friday's symbolic air strike provided. 
</P>
<P>
 The commander of U.N. forces in Bosnia, British Lt. Gen. Michael Rose, warned 
the rebels that they could face further air attacks unless they surrender 
dozens of other heavy weapons they are known to have in violation of the 
Sarajevo exclusion zone. 
</P>
<P>
 Mission officers also are working on plans for a house-to-house search for 
snipers in Sarajevo to wipe out the greatest and most persistent menace to 
civilians, a U.N. source at mission headquarters in Zagreb, Croatia, reported. 
</P>
<P>
 The focus on keeping what has been a relative peace in the Bosnian capital for 
the past five months appeared to demonstrate NATO and U.N. resolve to provide 
genuine protection to at least the most visible of Bosnia's six U.N.-designated 
havens. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday's air strike, which destroyed an antitank gun of little military value, 
was considered more important for the line it drew after a period of several 
months in which international resolve to enforce the exclusion zone around 
Sarajevo had been clearly flagging. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted to send a message," said the U.N. Protection Force commander, 
French Gen. Bertrand de Lapresle, suggesting that the rebels must now reckon 
with similar sanctions if they persist with violations. 
</P>
<P>
 But the NATO action, which U.N. officials took pains to describe as "a 
proportionate response" to the Bosnian Serb weapons heists, stirred some fears 
in Zagreb and Sarajevo that the international community has simply upped the 
ante for enforcing its own resolutions. 
</P>
<P>
 There is now little the U.N. mission can do to force the withdrawal of other 
heavy weapons violating the exclusion zones, short of bombing some of the more 
strategic positions to show the rebels that the allies mean business. 
</P>
<P>
 Violations are even more blatant at the weapons exclusion zone proclaimed by 
NATO around the embattled eastern enclave of Gorazde, another U.N.-designated 
"safe area" that the Bosnian Serbs have been attacking with impunity. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday's air action, initiated by Rose, marked one of the few times during the 
28-month Serbian rebellion in Bosnia that the U.N. mission and NATO combined to 
actually follow through on one of the international community's many verbal 
threats to take action if the rebels continued to ignore their demands. 
</P>
<P>
 "The system is not perfect, but something had to be done in the face of such a 
flagrant violation," Rose said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 The easing of the siege of Sarajevo was largely a result of NATO's threat to 
bomb heavy weapons left within striking range of the capital after the 
withdrawal deadline of Feb. 21. 
</P>
<P>
 But Rose has taken personal pride in his association with what was likely the 
most significant accomplishment of the entire U.N. mission in the Balkans. 
</P>
<P>
 NATO officials here, pleased both at the chance to defend the exclusion zone 
and at the strike's success, saw the chain of events as a positive development 
that, in the words of one senior official, "sent the right signal and triggered 
the proper response." 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know if it makes us look good, but it certainly reinforces our 
credibility," this official said. "I had my personal doubts that they'd ask for 
air strikes, but they did and they went according to plan. If there are going 
to be weapons exclusion zones, they should be enforced." 
</P>
<P>
 John Jeffrey, a spokesman at NATO's Southern European Command headquarters in 
Naples, Italy, reported that the skies over Bosnia were quiet Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are flying what we consider to be the appropriate number of missions (over 
Bosnia-Herzegovina), and there have been no incidents," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Western diplomats based in the Balkans, however, were more skeptical of the 
sincerity of the rebels' purported contrition. 
</P>
<P>
 They pointed to a pattern of escalating Bosnian Serb provocations throughout 
the course of the war that have pushed a reluctant international community into 
firmer and more frequent applications of force. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is safe to say they will continue probing the limits of the West's 
willingness to use air power," one diplomat said. "It is less easy to predict 
how far the allies are prepared to go in using it." 
</P>
<P>
 Marshall reported from Brussels and Williams from Zagreb, Croatia.

DEMOCRATIC GRIDLOCK BODES ILL FOR NOVEMBER ELECTIONS; POLITICS: INTERNAL 
DIVISIONS ARE BLOCKING KEY BILLS. THE PARTY'S MIDTERM PROSPECTS MAY BE HURT AS 
A RESULT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RONALD BROWNSTEIN, TIMES POLITICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Liberal Rep. Ronald V. Dellums (D-Oakland) is likely to support the House 
Democratic leadership's health care plan but hasn't decided to back the massive 
crime bill now stalled on the brink of final passage. Moderate Rep. Dave 
McCurdy (D-Okla.) supports the crime bill but opposes the leadership's health 
care measure. 
</P>
<P>
 At the moment, House Democratic leaders don't count enough votes to pass 
either the health care legislation Dellums wants or the crime bill McCurdy 
supports. That, in a nutshell, is the Democrats' dilemma as they approach a 
midterm election some party leaders fear could deteriorate into a rout. 
</P>
<P>
 On not only health care and crime, but also welfare and campaign finance 
reform, shifting coalitions of disaffected Democrats in both houses are 
blocking Congress from completing action on issues that could bolster the 
standing of President Clinton and the party in November. 
</P>
<P>
 On each of these issues, individual Democrats are trying to avoid positions 
that could prove controversial at home or are defending interests they consider 
critical to their political survival. But party strategists are increasingly 
concerned that the cumulative effect of these decisions is to reinforce 
disenchantment with Congress and weaken the party's midterm prospects as a 
whole. 
</P>
<P>
 To students of game theory, it is a classic dilemma: By seeking to fortify 
their positions as individuals, Democrats may be cutting the ground from 
beneath themselves as a group. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now, the image that's being conveyed to the American people is that we 
can't get the job done," said Democratic pollster Mark Mellman. "Unfortunately, 
that fits in with the American public's preconception of Congress -- and that 
will hurt incumbents." 
</P>
<P>
 To Republicans, already expecting a rich harvest of new congressional seats in 
November, the self-imposed Democratic gridlock is a windblown bounty. "It's so 
nuts, you cannot believe it will continue all the way through October," said 
Republican pollster Bill McInturff. "If it does -- wow! Then they will face 
monumental losses." 
</P>
<P>
 Democratic congressional leaders are cautiously optimistic that nervous 
rank-and-file legislators will ultimately accept the power of that logic. This 
week, they're hoping to complete final action on the long-delayed crime bill in 
the House, begin floor debate on health care reform in the Senate, and perhaps 
make a breakthrough on campaign finance legislation long immobilized in a 
House-Senate conference committee. 
</P>
<P>
 "Today it looks really screwy," acknowledged Tom O'Donnell, chief of staff for 
House Majority Leader Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.). "But we've got more time, 
and I think we will get a lot of this stuff done." 
</P>
<P>
 Given the intensity of public concern about crime, Democrats are likely to 
obtain final approval this month for the long-delayed $33-billion crime bill -- 
though even that would put the bill on Clinton's desk almost half a year later 
than the White House once hoped. But on health care, campaign finance, and 
welfare reform, the prospects and timetable are murkier. 
</P>
<P>
 The long, enervating struggles over these issues raise questions about the 
capacity of Democrats, who control both chambers of Congress, to surmount not 
only Republican opposition but their own differences in the interest of 
assembling a stronger record for November. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a very serious problem," said Democratic pollster Alan Secrest, who 
works with many party centrists. "Politics is said to be the art of compromise. 
But there are some pretty serious stakes here if this Congress can't come to a 
consensus and bring to a close some of these issues." 
</P>
<P>
 Almost every imaginable permutation of internal division has confounded 
Democratic efforts to finish action on these four high-visibility initiatives. 
</P>
<P>
 On health care, the principal problem is the party's right wing. In both 
houses, resistance from moderate and conservative Democrats to a requirement 
that employers help pay for their workers' health insurance poses a huge threat 
to Clinton's signature promise: guaranteed health coverage for all Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 On welfare reform, the principal problem is the party's left wing. Angry 
resistance from House liberals to Clinton's plan during recent House Ways and 
Means Committee hearings has virtually obliterated the always-slim prospects 
that Congress would deal with the issue this year, congressional leaders say. 
</P>
<P>
 Further delay is likely, even though many Democrats are eager to run on the 
issue this fall. And probable Republican gains in November could leave liberals 
facing an even more inhospitable legislative climate on welfare reform next 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 On crime, the problem comes from both wings. Last week, House leaders were 
forced to postpone final consideration of the President's crime bill because an 
incongruous alliance of liberal and conservative Democrats refused to support a 
key procedural vote needed to bring the measure to the floor. 
</P>
<P>
 On the left, liberals led by the Congressional Black Caucus are angry that 
House-Senate conferees dropped the so-called racial justice provision that 
would allow defendants to challenge death sentences as racially discriminatory. 
On the right, conservative Democrats, under pressure from the National Rifle 
Assn., are fighting a last-ditch attempt to remove from the legislation a ban 
on 19 types of assault-style weapons. As they recessed for the weekend, House 
leaders were optimistic they could assemble the needed votes, but were still 15 
to 20 short. 
</P>
<P>
 On campaign finance, the problem is institutional, not ideological. House 
Democrats depend heavily on campaign contributions from political action 
committees, so they are resisting Senate efforts to cut the amount PACs can 
give to candidates. Senate Democrats depend heavily on large donations from 
individuals, so they are resisting House proposals to cap the share of funds a 
candidate can raise from that source. 
</P>
<P>
 Both sides are "scared that any change in the current law, in the system that 
they have mastered, will disadvantage them," said Ellen Miller, executive 
director of the Center for Responsive Politics in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 The chaos reflects both short-range and long-term trends. It testifies to the 
reluctance of many Democrats to embrace ideas associated with Clinton. It also 
illustrates the declining ability of congressional and party leaders to herd 
legislators behind a common agenda. Said one House Democratic aide trying to 
round up votes on the crime bill: "No one . . . will exact any punishment (for 
opposing the party). There are no sticks left. There are some carrots, but 
there is no punishment." 
</P>
<P>
 But on each of these issues, the biggest problem Democrats face could be 
another dilemma addressed by game theorists: While the risks of inaction are 
potentially formidable, they are less immediate and concentrated than the risks 
of action. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, political operatives say, individual legislators know precisely 
what to expect if they cross the NRA by backing the assault-weapon ban, or 
anger the National Federation of Independent Business by supporting mandatory 
employer financing of health care benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 "What goes on in the back of a member's mind is the 30-second ad that says: 
'They want to take away your choice of a doctor,' 'They want to take away your 
gun,' " said an aide to a moderate Democrat who hasn't decided to back either 
the health care or crime bills. 
</P>
<P>
 It is more difficult to quantify the political threat to individual Democrats 
if Congress cannot achieve significant progress on crime or health care. But, 
as Mellman noted, if deadlock further intensifies public disenchantment with 
Clinton and Congress, that undoubtedly will sweep away some more Democratic 
incumbents in November -- though it is impossible to predict which ones. 
</P>
<P>
 "That is a much less visible threat," Mellman said. "Nobody is looking down a 
barrel of gun, saying: 'It's pointed at my head if we don't get something 
done.' But there will be people who wake up this November shocked that they 
lost, who thought it could never happen to them, but who could not overcome the 
climate."

EXPULSION NO EASY ANSWER TO STUDENTS WITH GUNS; EDUCATION: L.A. DISTRICT POLICY 
APPLIES TO DIVERSE CIRCUMSTANCES. SOME SAY PENALTY ADDS TO PROBLEM.

 Renee Benson used an emotional plea. Vickie Yates used an attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, both women tried to dissuade the Los Angeles Board of Education 
from expelling their children for having weapons at school, a growing problem 
that has prompted tougher punishment to stem campus shootings. 
</P>
<P>
 "She made a stupid mistake, but sometimes children of 13 make stupid 
mistakes," Benson said, her eyes brimming with tears. Benson's 13-year-old 
daughter admits bringing a BB gun that looked like a revolver to Lawrence 
Middle School in Woodland Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Yates' 14-year-old son admits knowing there was a 9-millimeter handgun in his 
locker at Wright Middle School in Westchester. 
</P>
<P>
 The two cases, typical of the expulsions reviewed by the board every two 
weeks, underscore the rigidity of the school board's policy, critics say. Board 
members find themselves with little or no leeway in weapons cases, forced to 
expel students -- like Yates' son -- who didn't even touch the gun. 
</P>
<P>
 Benson's daughter, Nicole, was expelled. Yates' attorney, Wendy Segall, had 
more luck. She persuaded the board to delay a decision on the case until 
mid-September as well as review a portion of the Los Angeles Unified School 
District's expulsion policy. 
</P>
<P>
 Board members who support the 15-month-old policy say they would rather expel 
students for bringing guns to school than reassign them to other campuses, 
which is what the school district did for years. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, students can usually reapply for admission to district schools within 
at least six months of their expulsion, supporters say. 
</P>
<P>
 The board is not unanimous on the issue. "The cost for these kids is just too 
high," said member Jeff Horton, who opposes the district's expulsion policy for 
students under 16. "Kicking a kid out of school, in my mind, only encourages 
antisocial behavior." 
</P>
<P>
 State and district officials say they have little choice. They do not want to 
assign students to other campuses if there is a chance of violence. 
</P>
<P>
 "The reality is you have to have a rigid policy because (weapons possession) 
is so prevalent," said Maureen DiMarco, Gov. Pete Wilson's secretary of 
education and child development. "Certainly in Los Angeles, where they've had 
students tragically killed with weapons, I think you have to have strong 
policies. 
</P>
<P>
 "What are the other options? You could frisk and metal-detect every single 
student and then school would start at one o'clock in the afternoon," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The current board policy requires students who bring guns to school -- 
including BB guns and stun guns -- to be expelled from the district. 
Previously, those students could be assigned to alternative campuses within the 
district. 
</P>
<P>
 The state law governing expulsions is less severe. It allows districts to 
either expel students or transfer them. 
</P>
<P>
 Board members amended their policy three times in as many years after being 
harshly criticized for transferring weapons-toting students rather than 
expelling them. In addition, the board was under pressure to make schools safer 
after three campus shootings last year, two of them fatal. 
</P>
<P>
 During the 1993-94 school year, the board expelled 166 students for bringing 
guns to school. In 1992-93, the board expelled 256 students. 
</P>
<P>
 Board members excused just two students from the expulsion policy in the last 
18 months. Both cases involved BB guns found in the students' lockers. The 
board -- and the officials who review each case -- found that the students had 
intended to inform authorities when the weapons were discovered. 
</P>
<P>
 District officials say Benson's daughter -- known to the school board as Case 
494 -- and Yates' son -- known as Case 581 -- are typical of the dozens of 
expulsion cases they review. Both students had minor behavioral problems before 
and received mostly Cs and Ds in class. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to their trouble with school district authorities, the two face 
charges in the juvenile court system. If found guilty of bringing firearms to 
school, a felony, they could be sentenced to a maximum of four years detention. 
</P>
<P>
 Both say they are at most guilty of being loyal to friends, even for the wrong 
reasons. Their parents say they did not have the emotional maturity to turn 
their friends in. 
</P>
<P>
 Sean Swan, who keeps a pet rat named Pepper and a collection of video games in 
his room, said his best friend brought a handgun and bullets to school on May 
24. Sean, who is Vickie Yates' son, said his friend showed him the gun before 
classes began. 
</P>
<P>
 The boy told Sean that he needed it for protection because he had been 
threatened by 18- and 19-year-old gang members. 
</P>
<P>
 "I said, 'No matter what you do, don't put it in my locker,' " said Sean, who 
shared a locker with the boy in violation of school rules. 
</P>
<P>
 But after lunch, Sean went to his locker and saw the gun. Again, he said, he 
told his friend to remove the weapon. 
</P>
<P>
 But the friend ignored Sean and boasted to other kids about the handgun, even 
showing it to classmates. Then somebody told. Sean was taken to the office, 
arrested by police, then kicked out of school. His friend also was arrested and 
eventually expelled. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, the soft-spoken youth has spent his time playing computer games, 
walking his dog and thinking about what's next. His mother keeps a chalkboard 
list of his chores posted in the kitchen, including homework and cleaning his 
room. At the top, she wrote, "Sean, I love you." 
</P>
<P>
 The eighth-grader says he has learned his lesson. "I don't care who my friends 
are -- I will tell next time," he said. "I don't ever want to go through this 
again. I would tell someone immediately." 
</P>
<P>
 His mother, a single woman and legal secretary in Century City, said she hired 
an attorney after talking to the lawyers at her firm. They suggested that the 
legal representation might help. Yates decided to take their advice even though 
hiring an attorney will cost her at least $1,500, which is creating a financial 
hardship, Yates said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sean, she added, "is going to get a job and pay this back." 
</P>
<P>
 So far, Yates' efforts have paid off. Segall, the attorney, argues that Sean's 
expulsion should be overturned on a legal technicality involving the definition 
of possession. Sean, she says, should not have been considered to be in 
possession of the weapon because it was in a locker he shared with another 
student. 
</P>
<P>
 "My argument is simply that there was no possession, and I feel that the board 
has not been given a complete definition of what possession is," Segall said. 
"He should be punished for sharing the locker and for not telling anyone about 
the gun, but they have no policy for that." 
</P>
<P>
 After a lengthy dialogue with Segall, the district's lawyers and other 
officials, the board on Monday night took five votes on the issue and ended up 
agreeing to delay the case and review that section of the policy. 
</P>
<P>
 Board member Vickie Castro supported Sean's expulsion, saying that even 
knowledge of a gun should be grounds for expulsion. "We've lost students at 
other schools and the bigger crime was that there were other students who knew 
there were guns on campus," Castro said. "A gun on campus is serious and 
endangers everyone on that site. If you know there's a gun, it's your 
obligation to report it." 
</P>
<P>
 Board member Leticia Quezada agreed but said the expulsion should be upheld 
"for fairness and equity." 
</P>
<P>
 While the board debated Sean's case for about an hour, Renee Benson says she 
was completely ignored. Benson, who waited six hours before she could speak to 
the board last week, offered an impassioned plea that ended with tears rolling 
down her face. 
</P>
<P>
 "Is it your goal to make my daughter a gang member or a criminal by turning 
her out into the street?" she said. "I am asking every single one of you to 
rescue my child and allow her back into school." 
</P>
<P>
 It was her second attempt to get the board to overturn her daughter's 
expulsion, but the board swiftly and without comment voted to expel Nicole. 
</P>
<P>
 For Nicole Benson, the board action means that she cannot attend a district 
school for at least six months. She could reapply for admission then, and the 
decision would be up to the school board. 
</P>
<P>
 She says a friend handed her the BB gun before she got on the school bus last 
April. Nicole says she didn't want to take the weapon, but her friend asked her 
to keep it until after school. 
</P>
<P>
 When she got to school, Nicole said she let another friend borrow her jacket 
-- with the empty BB gun in the pocket. The friend showed it to other students 
and before long, Nicole was pulled out of class and arrested. 
</P>
<P>
 The BB gun had been placed in a locker and district officials said they still 
are uncertain who placed it there. Nonetheless, Nicole was expelled and faces 
felony charges for bringing a weapon to school. 
</P>
<P>
 The girl says she has paid enough. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know how scared I was?" Nicole said, flopping down on the couch at her 
North Hollywood apartment. "I thought I was never going to get home. I thought 
I was never going to see my mom again." 
</P>
<P>
 Her mother said suspension from school would have been enough. Placing her 
daughter in a county school -- her only alternative because she cannot afford 
private school, she said -- will be a nightmare for Nicole. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's worth saving. She's not violent," Renee Benson said. "(But) their 
policy makes no provision for stupid mistakes."

PEDALING INTO THE FUTURE; TRANSPORTATION: THE BIKE-LIKE HUMAN-POWERED VEHICLES 
USE THE LATEST DESIGN AND SCIENCE TECHNIQUES TO MOVE RIDERS FARTHER AND FASTER. 
HPV ENTHUSIASTS GATHERED RECENTLY TO TEST THEIR CRAFT.

<P>
 Steve Markhem did a double take as what looked like an egg on wheels flashed 
by a shopping mall in this North Coast timber town. 
</P>
<P>
 A moment later, a contraption with two drivers seated back to back rounded a 
corner. Then a yellow blur shaped like the nose of an airplane whizzed by. 
</P>
<P>
 "What in the world is that?" Markhem asked, dumbfounded by the sight. 
</P>
<P>
 A bird? A plane? A UFO? 
</P>
<P>
 Try human-powered vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
 A Southern California invention, human-powered vehicles (enthusiasts call them 
HPVs) are any type of vehicle propelled exclusively by human muscle. They have 
pedals and wheels, like bicycles, but many also have aerodynamic shells, some 
sleek, others funky and whimsical. 
</P>
<P>
 About 75 of them flocked to Eureka during the past week for the 20th annual 
International Human Powered Vehicle Speed Championships, which concludes today. 
They and their drivers came from around the United States and from places such 
as England and Germany to take part in the unusual competition. 
</P>
<P>
 The purpose: to optimize human power with the latest advances in science, 
technology and human ingenuity. The objective: to determine who has the fastest 
HPV on Earth. 
</P>
<P>
 "The ordinary bicycle design is a design from a hundred years ago. . . . It's 
outdated and inefficient," said Mhyee, a 27-year-old part-time baker from 
Arizona who discovered HPVs while competing in 24-hour bike marathons several 
years ago. "I thought I'd ride a bike that would take me farther and more 
comfortably." 
</P>
<P>
 Marti Daily, president of the 2,500-member International Human Powered Vehicle 
Assn., said the competition was started 20 years ago by a Los Angeles-based 
group that ran its first creations at Ontario Motor Speedway. 
</P>
<P>
 They wanted to test their ideas "of what actually constituted a faster 
bicycle," she said. Two HPV drivers broke a land speed record in 1980 at the 
Ontario track, earning a spot in the Guinness Book of World Records. 
</P>
<P>
 Al Krause, co-founder of the Redwood Empire HPV Assn., is hoping to organize 
an annual West Coast HPV competition, with Eureka as a regular stop. "I feel we 
can only expect to see continued growth . . . and increasing interest in HPV 
racing," said Krause, a self-taught artist and engineer who has been racing 
HPVs for 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Barred from competition in races sponsored by conventional cycling 
associations, such as the Union Cycliste Internationale, these innovative 
HPVers believe they represent the cutting edge of bicycle development. 
</P>
<P>
 Some call the vehicles New Age bicycles. Whatever the label, they turn heads. 
</P>
<P>
 And that might not be as easy as you would think here. Eureka, after all, is 
the home of the Kinetic Sculpture Race, a wacky three-day race over land, sea 
and sand held annually on Memorial Day weekend in Humboldt County. 
</P>
<P>
 Some kinetic racers switched to HPVs when they got serious about racing, said 
David (Clock Doc) Hitchcock, a businessman with a Ph.D. who helped organize and 
is one of the timekeepers for the kinetic sculpture race. Both events attract 
eccentric, inventor types, many of whom have advanced degrees in mechanical 
engineering or mathematics. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite their startling appearances, HPVs are serious bikes. Many are 
meticulously designed and constructed by university research teams with budgets 
of $70,000 or more. 
</P>
<P>
 The world's fastest HPV is the Dexter-Hysol Cheetah, engineered on computer 
design and analysis software by UC Berkeley students. The rider leans way back, 
enclosed in an aerodynamic bubble made of lightweight carbon composite. 
</P>
<P>
 Others are practically held together by shoelaces and bubble gum, such as one 
seen this week encased in flimsy cardboard that fluttered in the wind. 
</P>
<P>
 Four basic categories of HPVs competed: utility vehicles, intended for use 
around town to carry things such as groceries; all-terrain vehicles, which, 
like kinetic sculptures, must traverse land, sea and mud; human-powered boats, 
and "streamliners," or speed bikes. 
</P>
<P>
 Prizes consisted essentially of honor and camaraderie. In the past, DuPont 
Corp. offered prizes of $15,000 to $25,000 to the first vehicles to surpass 
certain limits. 
</P>
<P>
 The competition had its fun moments. Traditionally, any vehicles breaking the 
55 m.p.h. speed limit in West Coast competitions are given honorary speeding 
tickets by the California Highway Patrol. This week in Humboldt Bay, a 
patrolling sheriff's boat zapped human-powered water vehicles going 10 m.p.h. 
with a radar gun. 
</P>
<P>
 There were grim moments as well, such as when a British Columbia entry, Varna 
II, crashed Monday at the Redwood Acres Speedway during a practice run. The 
driver sustained a minor injury, but the vehicle was undamaged. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the dense sea-level air and fog in the area, and because of the 
frequency of strong Pacific winds, few HPVers seriously expected to break any 
world records. 
</P>
<P>
 One exception was Mhyee, from the town of Sahuarita, south of Tucson, who 
arrived here in a beat-up pickup with his HPV poking out the back. 
</P>
<P>
 Mhyee, who said his single name (pronounced me ) focuses him on his inner 
identity, used his skill in meditation to power himself onward during his 
grueling, record-breaking performance. 
</P>
<P>
 His rocket-like vehicle, called Gold Rush America, was dotted with decals and 
totally enclosed in a streamlined shell, except for a small hole near the top 
where his helmet protruded. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday morning, Mhyee broke two world records when he circled a small oval 
track 1,876 times. He pedaled 607 miles in 24 hours, breaking the old record 
for the most distance cycled in that time by six miles. At 25 hours, 7 minutes, 
he crossed the 1,000-kilometer line, breaking the prior mark for that distance 
by two hours. 
</P>
<P>
 About 4 a.m. Tuesday, into the final hours of the tortuous race, Mhyee was 
heard singing loudly. Tunes such as "Roxanne" emanated from the vehicle. 
Afterward, he needed the help of several people to pry him from the tiny, 
bubble-shaped vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
 He believes his cycling draws attention to a cleaner, healthier, more 
ecologically sound lifestyle. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd like to influence people, especially kids. I'd just like to show that we 
as humans can have and do have determination to do anything we want and 
shouldn't give up hope for the outcome of ourselves and humanity," he said.

FEDERAL PROBE FOCUSES ON FRESNO LAND DEALS; GOVERNMENT: A HOMETOWN HERO TURNS 
WHISTLE-BLOWER AS AN INQUIRY LOOKS INTO THE CLOSE TIES BETWEEN A HANDFUL OF 
ELECTED OFFICIALS AND LOCAL DEVELOPERS. 
</P>

<P>
 Of the successes that rose from the Dust Bowl migration here, none has been 
more stunning than that of the Tatham family, horse traders extraordinaire who 
parlayed a few nursing homes into a $200 million fortune in real estate and 
farm holdings. 
</P>
<P>
 Their journey from Oklahoma poverty to Fresno riches was recently captured in 
a major book, "Rising in the West," the story of an Okie family from the Great 
Depression through the Ronald Reagan years. 
</P>
<P>
 It closed with the dreams and foibles of the next generation, in particular 
Bill Tatham Jr., who collected headlines and headaches in the 1980s trying to 
turn his Arizona Outlaws into a National Football League franchise. 
</P>
<P>
 Now what may be the most improbable chapter of all in the family's saga is 
being written here. Four months ago, the 39-year-old Tatham, also known as 
"Wild Bill," walked into a meeting wired for sound and walked out with a tape 
recording of a city councilman and lobbyist allegedly soliciting a bribe from 
Tatham, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 It has set into motion a wide-ranging FBI and IRS investigation into the 
long-rumored corrupt ties between some politicians and builders. And it has 
thrust Tatham, a real estate investor whose close relationship to the mayor of 
Fresno became a campaign issue 18 months ago, into the unlikely role of 
whistle-blower. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've taken a huge risk and I know I'm going to pay a big price," said Tatham, 
a lawyer who returned to Fresno in 1988 after failing to land an NFL franchise 
in Phoenix. "I may never do business in this town again. But the bottom line is 
I had no choice but to go to the FBI. It's one of the few things I've done in 
my life that feels good." 
</P>
<P>
 This land of raisins may be in for its first bloodletting since the great 
liquor scandal of 1925, thanks to the local football hero come home. 
</P>
<P>
 What began in March as an inquiry of one city councilman and a building 
industry lobbyist in the adjacent town of Clovis now appears to be a wider 
investigation into land-use matters in greater Fresno, one of the 
fastest-growing regions in the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal authorities confirm that a probe is ongoing but refuse to identify the 
politicians and developers who are being investigated. Sources say that federal 
agents are not only exploring the close ties between a handful of elected 
officials and local developers, but they are questioning such heavyweights as 
Kaufman & Broad, the state's biggest home builder and a newcomer to this area. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources questioned by federal agents said the investigation is focusing on at 
least two council members in Fresno and Clovis allegedly selling land-use 
votes. These supposed tit for tat deals appear to have worked in one of three 
ways, sources say: cash listed on public records as legitimate campaign 
contributions, money laundered to buy political advertising, or under the table 
payments that go directly into a politician's pocket. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources questioned in the probe said federal agents have marveled at the 
riches up for grabs and the stranglehold big builders appear to have on the 
political process. 
</P>
<P>
 In Fresno, City Hall observers can recall only one time -- during a period of 
14 months and hundreds of votes -- when the current City Council or planning 
commission denied a developer's request for rezoning or a plan amendment. 
</P>
<P>
 "You will not find a place with more tangled relationships," said Jim Klein, a 
former planning commissioner who was let go last year by Fresno Mayor Jim 
Patterson for voting against the building industry. 
</P>
<P>
 In the months since Tatham took part in the sting, federal authorities have 
convened a grand jury in Sacramento and subpoenaed about a dozen people to 
testify. No one has been indicted but nerves are frayed. More than one 
developer has swept his office for electronic bugs. 
</P>
<P>
 What has everyone so skittish is the reputation of the two investigators 
heading the case -- FBI Agent James J. Wedick and IRS Agent Howard Moline. It 
was Wedick who snared 14 people, including state Sens. Joseph B. Montoya, Alan 
Robbins and Paul Carpenter, in a FBI sting operation centered in the state 
Capitol. And it was Moline who helped Wedick track down the fugitive Carpenter 
in Costa Rica this spring. 
</P>
<P>
 The two men are keeping mum. "All we are able to say is that there is an 
investigation and Bill Tatham Jr. came to us and we view him as a victim," said 
Linda Wodarski of the U.S. attorney's office in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether a function of its detached geography -- 180 miles south of San 
Francisco, 210 miles north of Los Angeles -- or its complacent citizenry, 
Fresno has long been considered by the feds to be one of the most lawless 
cities in the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Its Chinatown opium dens and gambling halls were among the nation's busiest in 
the early 1900s. During Prohibition, a quarter of its police force -- the chief 
and several of his top men -- resigned after federal authorities caught them 
taking $120,000 in protection money from three bootleggers. 
</P>
<P>
 Latter-day Fresno has limped from scandal to scandal with nary a 
housecleaning. In 1950, vice lords devised a fantastic scheme to use a 
chinchilla farm to launder prostitution, gambling and drug proceeds for 
friendly politicians. In separate court cases in the 1970s, one developer was 
convicted of giving a $4,000 bribe and the councilman in question was acquitted 
of taking it. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Tatham Jr., a star running back in high school, says he knew nothing of 
this history while growing up. Even after leaving town and going toe to toe 
with the NFL in an antitrust lawsuit, Tatham said he was unprepared for how the 
game was played in Fresno. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't come home to make waves," he said. "I made plenty of waves in the 
football business. I just wanted to develop a few parcels in Clovis and be left 
alone." 
</P>
<P>
 What Tatham did not realize was how cutthroat the development business had 
become in response to Los Angeles-based Kaufman & Broad entering the market in 
1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Hometown builders such as John Bonadelle and his sons-in-law, Robert McCaffrey 
and Jerry DeYoung -- who had contributed to the campaigns of countless elected 
officials over the years -- were suddenly pressuring politicians to put 
roadblocks in front of Kaufman & Broad projects, according to several former 
and current City Council members who said they received pressure. 
</P>
<P>
 Sensing an opportunity, they said, some politicians began shaking down 
developers and builders. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to develop a 152-house project in Clovis and let Kaufman & Broad 
build it," Tatham said. "The word from the City Council was get rid of Kaufman 
& Broad and we'll pass it." 
</P>
<P>
 Tatham hired a well-known lobbyist, Jeff Roberts, to ease the project through. 
In January it became clear, Tatham said, that more lobbying was needed. Tatham 
and Roberts then met with Clovis City Councilman Leif Sorensen, and at least 
one of these meetings was secretly recorded by Tatham. 
</P>
<P>
 Sorensen, one of the targets of the federal probe, allegedly offered to change 
his pivotal vote on Tatham's subdivision, according to attorneys involved in 
the case. In return, according to Tatham, Sorensen demanded $10,000 in 
contributions to three council candidates backed by Bonadelle and other 
builders. 
</P>
<P>
 Lobbyist Roberts became a conduit for $2,500 from Tatham to the three 
pro-growth candidates, federal authorities allege. Roberts later returned 
another $5,000 check to Tatham. In a letter to Tatham quoted in the Fresno Bee, 
Roberts said he was returning the $5,000 check because he was concerned that it 
could be misconstrued as "unethical." 
</P>
<P>
 Roberts, Sorensen and the three candidates who shared the $2,500 have denied 
any wrongdoing, even though the contribution was not reported on campaign 
financial statements until after the feds came to town. The three candidates 
were defeated by slow-growth advocates in April. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not guilty of anything," Sorensen told the Bee. "It is pathetic that 
people would resort to this type of tactics to win a race in Clovis." 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been at this a long time and I've never been accused of anything," 
Roberts said. "I have to be really careful. It's my whole career on the line." 
</P>
<P>
 The tapes do not lie, Tatham says. He denies that he went to federal 
authorities after having second thoughts about his own role in a bribe. "I 
wasn't trying to save my own butt. These guys tried to extort $10,000 out of me 
and that's not the way I do business." 
</P>
<P>
 Sources questioned by federal agents said another $10,000 payment -- from 
Kaufman & Broad to a Fresno-Clovis real estate agent -- is also being examined. 
The head of Kaufman & Broad's local operations was fired in April after federal 
authorities began asking questions. A company spokesman said the firing was 
related to the employee "inappropriately" generating a $10,000 check for a 
proposed housing subdivision. The spokesman would not identify the real estate 
agent or the elected official for whom the payment was allegedly intended. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've cooperated with the U.S. attorney's office to the extent that they've 
asked us for information," said Greg Romano, Kaufman & Broad's spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources say federal agents are looking at similar deals in Fresno, including a 
vote in November to allow Kaufman & Broad to build houses with unusually small 
back yards. 
</P>
<P>
 The request was initially opposed by council members, with Councilman Robert 
Lung leading the charge. Two weeks later, the matter came before Lung and his 
colleagues. It was passed without a word of discussion. 
</P>
<P>
 Five days earlier, campaign records show, Lung received a $500 campaign 
contribution from Kaufman & Broad. "I happened to have a fund-raiser and they 
donated to my campaign," Lung said. "There was no quid pro quo."

'MYSTERY FUMES' DOCTOR TO FILE $6-MILLION CLAIM; MEDICINE: JULIE GORCHYNSKI, 
WHO SUFFERED KNEE DAMAGE IN THE BIZARRE INCIDENT, ACCUSES RIVERSIDE COUNTY OF 
STONEWALLING. OFFICIALS HAVE SAID THE HOSPITAL WAS NOT THE SOURCE OF THE ODOR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Because there is never a dull moment, never a routine, a career in emergency 
room medicine beckoned Dr. Julie Gorchynski. Standing on her feet 12 hours a 
day was a small price to pay for the most exciting and challenging career she 
could imagine. 
</P>
<P>
 But the 33-year-old physician said she never dreamed that emergency room work 
would send her into intensive care -- the victim of a bizarre poisoning that 
forced her to undergo knee surgery and that, for now, has left her unable to 
stand. 
</P>
<P>
 Gorchynski was the most seriously injured of six emergency room workers in 
what became known to the world as the "mystery fumes" case after a dying cancer 
patient was brought to Riverside General Hospital in February. 
</P>
<P>
 Gorchynski, who is on leave from Loma Linda University Medical Center, is 
ready to file a claim against Riverside County, angered by what she 
characterizes as the county "stonewalling" her attempts to get to the bottom of 
the mystery. 
</P>
<P>
 A Riverside County spokeswoman would not comment on Gorchynski's threatened 
claim, which is a precursor to a civil lawsuit. But officials have steadfastly 
maintained that the aging county hospital was not the source of the mystery 
fumes. 
</P>
<P>
 "The impact on our employees, some of whom remain ill, greatly concerns us," 
hospital administrator Tomi Hadfield said in April after the emergency room's 
plumbing and ventilation systems were examined by industrial hygienists and 
others in search of an explanation. Based on those reviews, "any reasonable 
person must conclude that the hospital's facilities continue to be safe and 
effective," Hadfield said. 
</P>
<P>
 The controversy over the fumes began Feb. 19, when Gloria Ramirez, a 
31-year-old cancer patient, was brought to the county hospital's emergency room 
with severe breathing difficulties. The room was evacuated when Gorchynski and 
others fell ill after inhaling what she said were ammonia-like odors. The toxic 
fumes, Gorchynski believes, came from blood drawn from Ramirez minutes before 
she died. 
</P>
<P>
 Another doctor, two nurses and two therapists also complained of dizziness and 
nausea, and two of them, who also collapsed, were hospitalized for several 
days. 
</P>
<P>
 Gorchynski was hospitalized for two weeks with breathing problems, muscle 
spasms and pancreatitis, and today is recovering from avascular necrosis of the 
knees -- deterioration of her knee bones caused by lack of blood circulation. 
Her prognosis is uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was the worst pain I'd been in in my life," she said of the damage to her 
knees. "It shot up my thighs and down to my ankles." 
</P>
<P>
 Gorchynski believes that the bone destruction was the direct result of 
whatever toxins she unwittingly inhaled that night because she had no existing 
conditions that could explain what afflicted her. 
</P>
<P>
 Gorchynski's orthopedic surgeon, who is treating her for the knee damage, 
agrees. 
</P>
<P>
 "Something entered her body by breathing, some sort of a volatile chemical," 
said Dr. Christopher Jobe at Loma Linda University Medical Center. "We have 
found no other reason for this." 
</P>
<P>
 The result, shown through magnetic resonance imaging, was "massive 
osteonecrosis" -- dead knee bones, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gorchynski was in a wheelchair for three months and today, even with crutches, 
can stand for only 15 minutes at a time. Full recovery, after two surgeries in 
April to reintroduce blood flow to her knees, might take two years, doctors 
said. If her body is unable to regenerate new bone, she will have to be fit 
with prosthetic joints. 
</P>
<P>
 Charging that Riverside County officials have botched the investigation into 
the highly publicized incident, Gorchynski said she will file a $6-million 
damages claim against the county Monday for emotional distress, medical costs 
and loss of earnings. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of all, though, Gorchynski said she wants the answers to the question 
that continues to baffle scientists and medical experts: What were those 
mystery fumes? 
</P>
<P>
 "The frustration and the anger is with me every day," Gorchynski said. 
"Because of the stonewall from the county, we don't know 100% for certain what 
happened. But the people responsible need to be held accountable. (Emergency 
room) doctors don't go to work and expect to be poisoned." 
</P>
<P>
 Her attorney, Russell Kussman -- who is a former emergency room doctor and 
board-certified internist -- said the county's refusal to concurrently share 
the findings of its investigations with Gorchynski, to aid in her recovery, is 
suspicious. 
</P>
<P>
 "The county's behavior suggests either incompetence or a cover-up," he said. 
"It's hard to believe that they're that incompetent, and that leaves only one 
other alternative. 
</P>
<P>
 "All we know is, something happened that night, and it either came from Gloria 
Ramirez or it came from the hospital." 
</P>
<P>
 Ramirez's family has filed its own wrongful death claim against the county, 
contending that fumes in the hospital were responsible for her death. 
</P>
<P>
 The Riverside County coroner's office determined that Ramirez died of cardiac 
dysrhythmia and acute renal (kidney) failure brought on by cervical cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 Kussman said it is his medical opinion that the only way cervical cancer could 
lead to kidney failure is if the tumor spread upward and obstructed both 
kidneys or both ureters, the tubes that carry urine from the kidneys to the 
bladder. 
</P>
<P>
 The final, nine-page autopsy report was released Thursday, concluding the most 
bizarre autopsy in county history -- one in which the forensic pathologist and 
his assistant donned moon suits and entered a specially built examination 
chamber, to the fascination of gathered media and the public. 
</P>
<P>
 In his final report, pathologist Dr. Robert Ditraglia blamed the renal failure 
on "obstructive uropathy, kidney." But he made no reference to tumors affecting 
either the ureters or the kidneys -- a curious and bothersome omission, Kussman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We still don't have all the answers," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In a previously released toxicology summary report, the coroner's office said 
it found nothing in Ramirez's system that might explain the emission of toxic 
fumes. But the complete toxicology report has not yet been released -- and it 
is needed to explain chemical findings that otherwise make no sense, Gorchynski 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 There were missed opportunities in the investigation to collect clues, Kussman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though the blood drawn from Ramirez was preserved, the syringe was 
disposed of in a hazardous materials container by an emergency room worker as 
the staff was dropping to the floor, and later destroyed in the hospital 
incinerator before anyone thought to save it. 
</P>
<P>
 Furthermore, no effort was made to shut off the emergency room's ventilation, 
to preserve whatever fumes might have been present. When the city Fire 
Department's hazardous materials team probed the room for gases more than two 
hours later, nothing unusual was detected. 
</P>
<P>
 Kussman also complains that Ramirez's body -- double-bagged, then placed in a 
sealed aluminum casket -- was not preserved properly by the coroner's office in 
the days between her death and the autopsy so that chemical agents could be 
better preserved. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal/OSHA, which investigates accidents in workplaces, and epidemiology experts 
with the state Department of Health Services are still investigating the 
incident but have not released any conclusions. 
</P>
<P>
 One state official said he has never seen his office resort to "such high 
science" to try to get to the bottom of a mystery. 
</P>
<P>
 But whether an answer will be forthcoming remains unclear. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no guarantee that our epidemiology study will find the answer to the 
mystery," said Scott Lewis, spokesman for the state health department. 
</P>
<P>
 Gorchynski says she has no doubt that something poisoned her that night. Both 
she and the head emergency room doctor said they saw a mysterious, yellowish, 
spiked crystal in the syringe containing Ramirez's blood. When Gorchynski was 
treated that night at a different hospital, a doctor and nurse there noted 
strange crystals in her blood, Gorchynski said. 
</P>
<P>
 Given the absence of organic causes, some medical experts having no special 
insight into the Gorchynski case have publicly suggested that she and the 
others may have fallen victim to mass hysteria, perhaps prompted when one 
person in the emergency room legitimately fell sick for reasons unrelated to 
Ramirez. 
</P>
<P>
 Gorchynski seethes at the speculation. "I had chemical burns in my throat and 
nose, lungs working at half-capacity, biopsies showing dead knees, a drop in 
enzyme levels and crystals in my blood as well. It's all medically documented," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 She wonders if the culprit might be ethylene oxide, a toxic gas that is used 
to sterilize medical equipment and that causes symptoms that she says are 
"identical" to hers when a person is exposed to it. Riverside General Hospital 
has previously been cited by Cal/OSHA for improper handling of ethylene oxide. 
The syringe, however, was in a sealed container from an outside medical 
supplies distributor until it was opened and used on Ramirez, Gorchynski said. 
</P>
<P>
 She has received psychiatric help to deal with nightmares, traumatic 
flashbacks and her mixed feelings of anger and sadness over what has happened 
to her. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I learned of my prognosis," she said, "I was devastated. I thought I'd 
be back to work in a few months. Now it's been nearly six months and I still 
don't know. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm learning to be patient," she said. "I'm doing research on what's happened 
to me, I'm doing physical therapy, and I'm studying for my specialty board. I 
want to stay with emergency medicine."

ON CALIFORNIA: FRIENDLY DESERT ADVICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER H. KING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The conversation began, as it often does between strangers, with the weather. 
Down in Death Valley and across the floor of the Mojave, the temperature had 
stood firm all day at about 115 degrees. Here in the higher desert, with a soft 
wind up and the sun headed down, it seemed just a bit cooler, didn't it? 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, I don't know," Irene Ausmus said, standing behind the counter of her 
weather-beaten general store, "some people have told me this is pretty nice. I 
say it's hot. It's always hot in the summer." 
</P>
<P>
 Well, the winters must be comfortable anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not really," the 62-year-old widow went on, deadpan. "It's cold. It snows 
some and it's windy." 
</P>
<P>
 And there are flash floods, right? 
</P>
<P>
 "No, the flash floods come later, when the snows melt." 
</P>
<P>
 In the spring? 
</P>
<P>
 "No, later than that," Ausmus said. "In the spring, it's still pretty cold." 
</P>
<P>
 Well, what about fall? It's pleasant in the fall, no? 
</P>
<P>
 She shrugged. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's all about the same. In the fall it's hot. Then it gets cold." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, Irene Ausmus -- postmaster of Cima, proprietor of its general store 
and, from all appearances, the town's only homeowner -- was not in the mood 
this day to sell strangers on the serenity of the East Mojave, a vast stretch 
of desert sometimes called the Lonesome Triangle. Instead, she had cast herself 
as the anti-booster. From weather the discussion drifted to rattlesnakes -- she 
prefers to kill them with a shovel -- and stranded tourists, and impassable 
roads, and other hardships humans can expect out here in the hot lonesome. 
</P>
<P>
 Given the context, this attitude was perfectly understandable. Congress is 
completing work on the Desert Preservation Act. In general, the legislation by 
Sen. Dianne Feinstein would create a huge national preserve in the California 
desert. Some of it seems hardly controversial, such as upgrading the Death 
Valley from a national monument to a national park. Trouble arises in places 
where the proposed federal protective status would require the acquisition of 
private land and the cessation of cattle grazing, mining, hunting and the like. 
The East Mojave -- a park in one version of the bill and a less-protected 
classification in another -- is one of those places. 
</P>
<P>
 Ausmus moved here in 1961, after her little girl developed lung problems 
living in Los Angeles. Her husband ran some cattle and she ran the post office 
and store. When he died four years ago, she sold the cattle, but otherwise 
stayed put. She had become one of those characters who populate, sparsely, the 
California desert, and are a large part of its charm. She had become a desert 
rat, content to sort the mail for her far-flung neighbors and sell ice and soda 
to the rare motorist. 
</P>
<P>
 Now she has seen the future, and it is wearing a Smokey Bear hat, and she is 
worried. "If this becomes a park," Irene Ausmus said, "they want to close my 
business down. They say it's an eyesore. That's the gossip anyway." True or not 
-- and confusion tends to dominate any detailed discussion of the desert bill 
-- Ausmus will agree that her little wood and tin outpost could profit from 
some paint. "I used to tell my husband he should paint it," she recalled, "but 
he wouldn't. He said the photographers loved it the way it was. They told him 
it had character." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The battle over federal desert protection has dragged on for a decade. The 
particulars change, but at the extremes the debate remains unchanged. 
Proponents point, quite accurately, to the surreal majesty of the landscape. 
They decry the damage done by cattle herds, miners' dynamite and dirt bikes. 
They note, again with accuracy, the seemingly irresistible surge of 
civilization -- condo cities from the west, casino meccas from the east -- into 
the desert. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents such as Ausmus, by contrast, believe it's folly to imagine tourists 
flocking to a desert in sufficient numbers to support a national park. Would 
you pack your children into this place in the summer? she asked. They contend 
that current protections are enough, that the ancient desert pretty much can 
protect itself. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just wish they would leave us alone," Ausmus said. "We could take care of 
what is out here. We do like it. I enjoy the sunsets, the early sunrises, the 
quiet. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 She caught herself, and toned down the rhapsody. No sense starting a tourist 
stampede, not now, with Washington debating her future. She walked her visitor 
out. He remarked on the beauty of a flowering plant. It's poisonous, she said. 
He climbed into his car. She warned him to be careful. Don't get lost. A lot 
can happen in the desert. Cars can break down. There are rattlers around. And 
coyotes. And the heat, did she mention the heat?

FORGET BOAT LIFT, U.S. TELLS CUBA

<TEXT>
<P>
 After threats by Cuban President Fidel Castro to unleash a mass exodus of 
refugees, U.S. officials Saturday warned the Communist regime that they will 
not permit a replay of the chaotic Mariel boat lift that brought about 120,000 
Cuban refugees to South Florida in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
 The exchange followed an extraordinary few weeks in Cuba.In the past 10 days, 
three passenger ferries have been hijacked in Havana harbor by Cubans desperate 
to flee. And thousands of angry Cubans gathered in Havana on Thursday and 
Friday, some taunting government security forces and chanting "down with 
Fidel." 
</P>
<P>
 Crowds, estimated by some to have reached 10,000, gathered in Old Havana when 
rumors spread that another Mariel boat lift was beginning. Thousands of Cubans 
watched as a ferry hijacked by passengers Thursday headed out to sea. Saturday 
evening, the ferry, which had run out of fuel, was back under the control of 
Cuban authorities, according to news reports from the island. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point Friday, hundreds of Cubans also tried to board Chinese and 
Canadian freighters in the port. Police and members of rapid response teams, 
many wielding guns and clubs, dispersed hundreds of rock-throwing protesters.

U.N. STEPS UP RELIEF EFFORTS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The United Nations sent blankets, soap and water cans to aid stations along 
the road into Rwanda on Saturday in a stepped-up effort to help refugees 
straggling home. 
</P>
<P>
 In the crowded camps around Goma, aid workers resumed food distribution in one 
of the largest settlements at Katale, lifting a one-day suspension prompted by 
deadly clashes between refugees and pilfering Zairian soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. crews took supplies to three aid stops operated by relief groups along 
the 40-mile road from the border to Ruhengeri, Rwanda. Today, convoys of 10 
trucks are scheduled to begin ferrying refugees from Ruhengeri to the Rwandan 
capital, Kigali. U.N. officials in Kigali said they planned to send food out in 
the trucks. 
</P>
<P>
 The improving aid and transportation network is part of plans by the Office of 
the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees to encourage the return of the nearly 1 
million Rwandans who fled to Zaire during the final days of the civil war last 
month. 
</P>
<P>
 There does not appear to be a major increase in the estimated 5,000 refugees 
crossing back home each day. So far, about 100,000 refugees have returned.

CEDRAS PREDICTS BLOOD BATH, SEES U.S. INVASION AS INEVITABLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL ROSS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Haitian military leader Lt. Gen. Raoul Cedras said in an interview aired 
Saturday that he believes a U.S. invasion of Haiti is unavoidable, and he 
predicted bloodshed "on both sides" because his armed forces would resist the 
takeover to their fullest. 
</P>
<P>
 William H. Gray III, President Clinton's special adviser on Haiti, said he 
agreed that the two sides appear to be on a "collision" course. Unless Haiti's 
military rulers step down and allow the return of the country's democratically 
elected president, Jean-Bertrand Aristide, armed intervention appears 
"inevitable," Gray said. 
</P>
<P>
 The tough talk came amid reports from Haiti that new recruits and civilian 
irregulars are being signed up to bolster the military's ranks following the 
U.N. Security Council's decision to authorize an invasion of the Caribbean 
nation. 
</P>
<P>
 Confirming the call-up in a televised interview on CNN, Cedras said he thinks 
the crisis has moved beyond the stage where diplomacy could avert an armed 
confrontation. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has been decided to invade, and we are awaiting the moment," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Using slowly tightening economic sanctions backed by the threat of an 
invasion, the Clinton Administration has been trying to pressure Cedras and the 
other military leaders who ousted Aristide into resigning and allowing the 
exiled president's return. 
</P>
<P>
 Interviewed separately on CNN's "Evans and Novak" program, both Cedras and 
Gray indicated that they think the long process of pressure and posturing by 
each side is finally drawing to a close as alternatives run out. 
</P>
<P>
 But Gray repeated what other senior officials, including Clinton, have said, 
indicating that the recently tightened embargo would be given more time to work 
before any decision is made to exercise "other options." 
</P>
<P>
 "There are still a series of economic pressure points we can work on," Gray 
said, referring to the recent arrival in the Dominican Republic of U.N. 
advisers charged with stopping the smuggling of fuel and other essentials 
across that country's porous border with Haiti.

 "We're going . . . to see in the next couple of weeks what sealing the border 
does," Gray said, adding that the Administration is considering a "variety of 
other options which I'm not at liberty to talk about" before deciding whether 
to invade.

ARAFAT PLEDGES TO CLEAN UP PLO'S BOOKS; MIDEAST: PRESSURED BY THE U.S. AND 
EGYPT, PALESTINIAN LEADER SAYS HE WILL DO WHAT'S NECESSARY TO CLEAR WAY FOR 
OUTSIDE AID. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat, responding to blunt warnings from both the United 
States and Egypt, promised Saturday to straighten out the Palestine Liberation 
Organization's chaotic financial management and complete long-delayed paperwork 
to clear the way for badly needed international aid. 
</P>
<P>
 In back-to-back meetings, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and Secretary of 
State Warren Christopher told Arafat that the fledgling Palestinian Authority 
in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank town of Jericho must act at once to 
convince international donors that aid money will be properly spent. 
</P>
<P>
 According to a senior U.S. official, Arafat pledged to sign a U.S. private 
investment agreement that has been delayed since June and to complete project 
specifications required by the World Bank, most of them pending for months. He 
also said the Palestinian Authority has begun collecting taxes after a slow 
start. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, Christopher said he has written to the world's richest 
countries urging them to begin honoring more than $2 billion in pledges made 
last year to finance the experiment in Palestinian self-government. 
</P>
<P>
 "Time is of the essence," Christopher said during a joint news conference with 
Mubarak. "It is important to have projects on the ground" to show restless 
Palestinians that last September's peace agreement with Israel will pay off in 
improved living conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher visited Alexandria, Mubarak's vacation home, at the start of a 
trip to the Middle East during which he hopes to narrow the differences between 
Israel and Syria in what remains the region's most perplexing conflict. 
</P>
<P>
 During Christopher's flight from Washington, a senior U.S. official said Syria 
and Israel are engaged in serious and substantive negotiations through a U.S. 
go-between. But he said that no final agreement will be possible until 
Jerusalem and Damascus resume face-to-face talks. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States and its allies have become increasingly impatient with the 
sloppy bookkeeping, inept fiscal management and cumbersome administration of 
the PLO-run government in Gaza and Jericho. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher has often urged Arafat to get his house in order, without much 
effect. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, the Clinton Administration tried to double-team the PLO leader. At 
Washington's suggestion, Mubarak invited Arafat to lunch before the Egyptian 
president's meeting with Christopher. U.S. officials said Arafat was then 
invited to join the Mubarak-Christopher meeting because he had seemed 
cooperative in his talks with the Egyptian president. 
</P>
<P>
 The senior U.S. official said Mubarak talked very little during the three-way 
meeting but that "the chairman seems to be more responsive in making 
commitments when he is in the presence of President Mubarak." 
</P>
<P>
 The official confirmed that Arafat did not bring any of the long-delayed 
documents with him but that "there were some very clear commitments." 
</P>
<P>
 "The (World) Bank has a fair number of projects that are ready to put 
contracts out on, but they require final project design specifications from the 
Palestinians," the official said. "That has not been finished, even though it 
was requested more than a month ago." 
</P>
<P>
 He said the PLO has not yet signed an agreement with the U.S. Overseas Private 
Investment Corp. -- a step required for U.S. private loans -- although 
Washington submitted the plan in June. The official said Arafat promised to 
sign the agreement "immediately." 
</P>
<P>
 The Palestinian Authority is desperate for cash to finance its police and 
other government operations. But the PLO has resisted demands for greater 
accountability. 
</P>
<P>
 "The hang-ups on the projects have a lot to do with documentation," the U.S. 
official said. "The hang-ups on disbursement have a lot do with filing 
receipts." 
</P>
<P>
 Following his meetings in Alexandria, Christopher flew to Israel, where he 
planned preliminary talks before heading for Damascus today to confer with 
Syrian President Hafez Assad. The Israel-Syria negotiations mark the most 
important phase of Christopher's Mideast trip.

ISRAELI-HEZBOLLAH TRUCE UNRAVELS; JERUSALEM'S TALKS WITH SYRIA AT RISK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A year-old truce negotiated by Secretary of State Warren Christopher between 
Israel and the militant Islamic organization Hezbollah in Lebanon has 
unraveled, just as Christopher returned to the region hoping to push 
Israeli-Syrian peace talks forward. 
</P>
<P>
 In what it said was retaliation for an Israeli attack Thursday on a southern 
Lebanese village, Hezbollah lobbed rockets into northern Israel on Friday and 
Saturday for the first time in a year. Three Israeli children were wounded in 
one of the attacks. And in Israel's self-proclaimed security zone in southern 
Lebanon, two soldiers were killed and two were wounded when a convoy was 
ambushed by gunmen. 
</P>
<P>
 Israeli authorities evacuated five miles of beach below Israel's border with 
Lebanon and ordered vacationers to leave the area. Israeli radio said many 
residents of northern towns spent Friday night in bomb shelters. The army 
retaliated by shelling southern Lebanese villages. 
</P>
<P>
 The upsurge in fighting between Israel and Hezbollah raises questions about 
how far Christopher will be able to push forward stalled negotiations between 
Syria and Israel. Syria, with about 35,000 troops in eastern Lebanon, is 
considered the primary political and military force in the country. Israel 
holds Syria responsible for Hezbollah's actions, and Prime Minister Yitzhak 
Rabin is likely to demand that the Syrians rein in Hezbollah. 
</P>
<P>
 "Christopher will probably try to handle this situation out of his back 
pocket, because he didn't come here to deal with Israel and Hezbollah again," 
said Martin Kramer, a specialist in Islamic militancy at Tel Aviv University. 
Whether or not the Israeli-Hezbollah fighting spirals out of control now "is 
really up to the Syrians," Kramer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kramer said Rabin will come under strong political pressure to retaliate 
massively against Hezbollah should rockets continue to fall on northern 
communities. In July last year, Hezbollah rocket attacks on the north led 
Israel to carry out Operation Accountability, a huge land, sea and air 
operation against southern Lebanese villages. That fighting stopped only after 
Christopher negotiated a cease-fire in which Hezbollah agreed to stop shelling 
northern Israel and Israel agreed to stop shelling southern Lebanese villages. 
</P>
<P>
 But after four attacks in Latin America and Britain last month against Jewish 
and Israeli targets, the cease-fire came apart. The Israelis accused Hezbollah 
of carrying out the bombings, which claimed more than 100 lives. Hezbollah 
denied any involvement. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, Israeli fighter planes attacked Hezbollah bases in southern 
Lebanon but also hit a village, killing seven civilians and wounding 17, 
according to Lebanese security sources. The Israelis apologized for the 
casualties, but Hezbollah issued a statement vowing it would seek vengeance. 
</P>
<P>
 An Israeli army spokesman said that Capt. Oren Avishalom, 24, and Pvt. Yevgeni 
Bartzlavski, 19, were killed when their army convoy was attacked by guerrillas 
near the village of Ishea, in Israel's security zone, before dawn Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 The spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that the army and its 
militia ally, the South Lebanon Army, responded to the attack and to mortar and 
rocket attacks on Israeli and SLA positions by shelling Hezbollah positions.

STARR PLEDGES 'EVENHANDED' WHITEWATER INVESTIGATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Times Staff, Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Newly selected Whitewater independent counsel Kenneth W. Starr promised a 
"fair and objective and evenhanded" probe Saturday and said he wanted to get to 
work quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to comment at all, projecting what might lay ahead," Starr, 
attending the American Bar Assn. convention here, told reporters. "It's 
important for me to go into this with an entirely open mind, trying to be very 
fair and very objective." 
</P>
<P>
 Starr said he anticipated meeting soon with the man he is replacing, special 
counsel Robert B. Fiske Jr., and called that "an appropriate first step." But 
he declined to discuss whether he would review the seven months of work already 
done or restart the inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's premature to be commenting on the substance of the investigation and 
procedures and issues that arise," he said. "I intend assiduously to be fair 
and objective and evenhanded and work as hard as I can." 
</P>
<P>
 Starr has the prerogative of reopening questions that Fiske had declared 
closed, such as whether there was any link between the Whitewater controversy 
and the suicide last year of Deputy White House Counsel Vincent Foster. 
</P>
<P>
 He could also reopen the question of whether Deputy Treasury Secretary Roger 
Altman lied to Congress about the extent of his contacts with the White House 
in his capacity of acting chairman of the Resolution Trust Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, Sen. Alfonse M. D'Amato (R-N.Y.) suggested that Starr should 
investigate whether any White House aides lied to Congress during the 
Whitewater hearings. 
</P>
<P>
 But Rep. Jim Leach (R-Iowa), a leading House critic on Whitewater, concluded 
that he was satisfied with the work Fiske had done. 
</P>
<P>
 Starr, solicitor general in the Bush Administration, was named independent 
counsel by a three-judge panel acting under the special prosecutors law enacted 
recently by Congress. Fiske was selected by Atty. Gen. Janet Reno, but he held 
the job only provisionally because the independent counsel law had technically 
lapsed.

NEWS ANALYSIS; HEARINGS EXPOSE WHITE HOUSE FOIBLES, FAILURES; PROBE: NO 
INTERFERENCE IS FOUND IN DISCUSSIONS ON RTC INVESTIGATION OF MADISON GUARANTY. 
BUT POSSIBLE ADMINISTRATION OFFENSES ARE UNCOVERED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SARA FRITZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When Republicans first learned that President Clinton's aides had been tipped 
off about the government investigation of his old friend and investment 
partner, James B. McDougal, they began using words not often heard here since 
the days of Watergate -- words like cover-up and obstruction of justice.  
</P>
<P>
 But nearly two weeks of intense congressional hearings have failed to produce 
any substantial evidence that the Clinton Administration actually interfered 
with the Resolution Trust Corp.'s investigation of McDougal's now-defunct 
Arkansas thrift, Madison Guaranty Savings & Loan. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the congressional questioning of top Administration officials has 
exposed other possible offenses. Among them are that Administration officials 
gave false testimony to Congress. Not only is it clear that Deputy Treasury 
Secretary Roger Altman gave incomplete information to the Senate Banking, 
Housing and Urban Affairs Committee on Feb. 24, it is now apparent that 
Administration officials saw nothing wrong with occasionally misleading 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 Furthermore, the hearings have exposed foibles and failures of top appointees 
and tensions within the Administration that are certain to prove embarrassing 
to the President. The Clinton White House was shown, among other things, to be 
obsessed by press inquiries, slow to fill key government jobs, often 
insensitive to the appearance of impropriety and sometimes plainly naive. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the Administration's strongest Democratic defenders in Congress were 
horrified by some of the White House machinations. Sen. Christopher J. Dodd 
(D-Conn.), for example, observed that the President's appointees were guilty of 
running "sort of a sloppy operation." 
</P>
<P>
 "You get the impression that the kids were in charge of the schoolyard here," 
said Rep. Marge Roukema (R-N.J.), referring to the young men and women on the 
President's staff who played a key role in these activities. 
</P>
<P>
 Until the controversial contacts between the White House and the Treasury 
Department, which oversees the RTC, became public knowledge last February, the 
President had been able to argue that the Whitewater controversy had nothing to 
do with his actions as President. In truth, his partnership with McDougal in 
the Whitewater real estate project occurred while he was governor of Arkansas. 
</P>
<P>
 But Republicans saw the White House-Treasury contacts as an indication that as 
President, Clinton was given an opportunity to meddle in the government's probe 
of charges that money from McDougal's savings and loan had been diverted into 
Clinton's gubernatorial campaign and to the Whitewater project. 
</P>
<P>
 On March 2, Rep. Jim Leach (R-Iowa) set the stage for the Whitewater hearings 
when he charged that a pattern of contacts between the White House and the 
Treasury Department had raised the specter of "obstruction of justice." Not 
since President Richard Nixon was accused of covering up Watergate had that 
charge been leveled at a President with such seriousness. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus it is not surprising that White House officials were quick to point out 
that Leach's charge remains unproven following the hearings. As White House 
Counsel Lloyd N. Cutler said: "No White House staff member made any effort to 
change any decision by the RTC and no decision by the RTC was changed." 
</P>
<P>
 Even Leach now grudgingly admits that the criminal probe has not been stymied 
by the actions of the White House, even though he is still not willing to 
concede that no efforts were made to do so. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet while White House officials succeeded in persuading most members of 
Congress that there was no attempt to obstruct justice, Altman failed to sell 
his argument that he did not intentionally mislead Congress on Feb. 24, when he 
admitted to only one of what has turned out to be nearly 40 contacts between 
the Treasury Department and the White House on the subject of the Madison 
Guaranty probe. 
</P>
<P>
 There is plenty of evidence to contradict Altman. 
</P>
<P>
 Treasury Chief of Staff Joshua L. Steiner wrote in his diary that Altman had 
"gracefully ducked" questions about the contacts. Associate White House Counsel 
W. Neil Eggleston recalled leaving the Senate Banking Committee room on Feb. 24 
and immediately calling to alert the White House that Altman had given an 
incomplete answer when asked about contacts with the White House. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet remarkably, even though two Ronald Reagan Administration aides were 
prosecuted for lying to Congress, some Clinton Administration officials were 
unconcerned by Altman's misleading testimony. Treasury Counsel Jean Hanson, who 
sat directly behind Altman as he testified Feb. 24, knew that he was 
misrepresenting the truth, but failed to get the record corrected. 
</P>
<P>
 Democrats and Republicans may be at odds over the highly partisan Whitewater 
issue, but there is no disagreement among them that the Administration's 
failure to correct the record was wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you sit there and you have the information and it is withheld, that is 
improper," said Sen. Donald W. Riegle Jr. (D-Mich.), chairman of the Senate 
banking panel. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Democrats acknowledged that the hearings had undermined the credibility 
of the Administration, especially when it was learned that Hanson helped 
prepare two differing answers to one question for her boss, Treasury Secretary 
Lloyd Bentsen. 
</P>
<P>
 In a revealing exchange with Sen. Paul S. Sarbanes (D-Md.), Steiner also 
demonstrated vividly how witnesses can trim their answers to misrepresent the 
truth. The exchange horrified Democrats as well as Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
 Sarbanes asked Steiner whether he had ever talked to either Altman or Hanson 
about their differing recollections of an event. Sensing that Steiner was not 
being forthcoming, Sarbanes persisted until he turned a negative answer into an 
affirmative one. 
</P>
<P>
 Steiner: ". . . I don't believe I've had any specific conversations with 
either Mr. Altman or Ms. Hanson." 
</P>
<P>
 Sarbanes: "Strike the word specific. Have you had any conversation?" 
</P>
<P>
 Steiner: "It's conceivable; I can't recall any conversations directly." 
</P>
<P>
 Sarbanes: "Strike the word directly. " 
</P>
<P>
 Steiner: ". . . Senator, I have heard conversations where Mr. Altman has 
commented that his recollection is different from Ms. Hanson's." 
</P>
<P>
 Following that exchange, it is not surprising that most members of Congress 
participating in the inquiry refused to believe Steiner when he sought to 
disavow some embarrassing diary entries. 
</P>
<P>
 In the final analysis, as even Clinton's defenders in Congress note, the whole 
controversy might have been avoided if top Administration officials had been 
just a bit more diligent about doing their jobs and a little less concerned 
about the news accounts of their work. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Altman was placed in an unusual position when the President appointed 
him to serve both as deputy Treasury secretary and acting head of the RTC. 
Altman, already deeply involved in economic policy, was asked to oversee the 
RTC because the President's nominee had withdrawn in the face of congressional 
opposition. 
</P>
<P>
 To this day, the job has not been permanently filled by Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 Fear of the press within the Administration was clearly demonstrated by the 
way Altman made his decision to disqualify himself from matters dealing with 
Madison Guaranty. Some of Altman's advisers felt he should disqualify himself 
in the case because, as a former classmate of the President, he was seen as 
being a close friend of Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 After talking to then-White House Counsel Bernard Nussbaum, who opposed the 
idea, Altman decided against disqualifying himself. But when he learned on Feb. 
25, that the New York Times was about to write an editorial criticizing him for 
not doing so, he promptly told the Times he had changed his mind. 
</P>
<P>
 Even Cutler was critical of the freewheeling way in which a wide range of 
Treasury and White House aides casually discussed sensitive issues with each 
other -- what he termed "too many people having too many discussions about too 
many sensitive matters." 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Robert F. Bennett (R-Utah), a Banking panel member who once worked in the 
Transportation Department, remarked that in his experience, sub-Cabinet 
officers did not circumvent the chain of command and go to top White House 
officials, as is done in the Clinton Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 But perhaps even more embarrassing for the Administration is the seemingly 
naive way in which top officials claim to have approached highly sensitive 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton aide George Stephanopoulos insisted that he was just "blowing off 
steam" when he complained to Altman about the selection of Republican Jay B. 
Stephens to lead the RTC's investigation into Madison Guaranty. And Hanson, a 
lawyer, insisted that when she first notified Nussbaum about a criminal probe 
of Madison, she never dreamed she could be inviting charges of obstruction of 
justice. 
</P>
<P>
 As she put it, "It never occurred to me that he would use that information for 
anything other than the governmental purpose for which it was intended."

MOTHER'S SUICIDE NOTE TELLS WHY SHE KILLED HER DAUGHTERS

<TEXT>
<P>
 A mother said in a suicide note that she killed her three daughters because 
they were unhappy living with their father. 
</P>
<P>
 Terri Lynn Esterak, 31, addressed the note to fiance Carlo DiPaolo, who read 
it at her funeral.Deputies on Monday found the letter with the bodies of Terri 
Esterak and daughters Erica, 13, Eden, 4, and Erin, 2, in a luxury villa at 
Indian Wells, an exclusive golf resort 20 miles east of Palm Springs. 
</P>
<P>
 Her former husband, Michael Esterak, had custody of the girls at his home in 
Long Beach. Esterak had temporary custody of her daughters during July, and 
they were supposed to return to their father last Sunday evening. Instead, she 
checked the girls into the Hyatt Grand Champions Villas. Sometime between 
Sunday morning and Monday afternoon, she killed the children and herself, 
Riverside County sheriff's investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This may not be right, but I hope God forgives me for doing this to our 
souls," her note to DiPaolo said. "I love you and wish I could stay, but I 
cannot go on with my life while my children suffer." 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Esterak's attorney, Constance Bessada, said her client was a loving 
father.

WINDS, TERRAIN HINDER BATTLE AGAINST WILDFIRE NEAR RENO

<TEXT>
<P>
 Strong winds and steep terrain hampered firefighters Saturday in their battle 
against a 6,800-acre wildfire near the California line in the Reno area that 
continued to put nearby residents on edge. 
</P>
<P>
 The fire, which destroyed three houses shortly after it started Thursday, 
threatened about 10 homes near the Gold Ranch Casino at one time Saturday 
afternoon, said Dave Reider, fire information officer. 
</P>
<P>
 "It made a run at them, but the firefighters beat it back," he said. "They set 
backfires on the ground and made water drops from the air. The fire came within 
100 yards of the nearest homes, so it could have been worse." 
</P>
<P>
 The threatened homes were surrounded by fire engines ready to spring into 
action. No evacuation order was issued Saturday and no injuries were reported. 
</P>
<P>
 The fire also had moved within a quarter-mile of Interstate 80 by Saturday 
evening, but the interstate remained open. Firefighters stood watch across the 
highway for hot spots that could develop because of burning embers. 
</P>
<P>
 Reider said crews managed to carve a line around 40% of the fire by Saturday 
evening, up from 25% on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 There was no estimate for full containment.

PRESIDENT BLASTS 'EXTREMIST INTERESTS' 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Trying to push health care legislation over the finish line in Congress, 
President Clinton said Saturday that "violent, extremist interests" are trying 
to keep the government from insuring health coverage for all Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton, addressing a $1-million fund-raiser for Michigan Democrats, said 
Republicans were refusing to compromise on health care and declared: "It is 
time to stop playing politics with the health care of the people of the United 
States of America." 
</P>
<P>
 He accused critics of Democratic health care plans of trying to deny all 
Americans the benefits they already enjoy. 
</P>
<P>
 "The violent, extremist interests in this country that are trying to keep 
health care out of the reach of ordinary American working people are a disgrace 
to the American dream," Clinton said in brief remarks at the airport. "Most of 
them have health care and most of them have parents on Medicare. Why do they 
not want you to have the same thing that they have?" 
</P>
<P>
 In his weekly radio address before leaving Washington, the President said the 
nation faces historic decisions "that call on us to break through partisan 
barriers and political rhetoric" on both health care and crime legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's stop playing games with these two important issues," Clinton said. 
"Let's get the job done." 
</P>
<P>
 In the Republican response, Sen. Conrad Burns of Montana complained that 
health care reform proposals were developed "behind Democratic closed doors." 
</P>
<P>
 Burns said Congress should approve reforms that a majority in the House and 
Senate agree on, and avoid socializing "the greatest health care delivery 
system on this planet."

FBI TO PROBE FIRE AT ALABAMA SCHOOL INVOLVED IN RACIAL FLAP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 An apparent arson fire left a school in smoldering ruins Saturday and stoked 
tensions in a dispute over the principal who opposed interracial couples at a 
prom. 
</P>
<P>
 The fire gutted all of the Randolph County High School classrooms only hours 
before marchers planned to form ranks for new protests targeting Principal 
Hulond Humphries. 
</P>
<P>
 Atty. Gen. Janet Reno ordered the FBI to investigate, Justice Department 
spokesman Myron Marlin said Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Blacks seeking to oust Humphries, who's white, canceled a protest march as 
tensions mounted and Ku Klux Klan members arrived in the east Alabama town. 
</P>
<P>
 But tempers had already flared. 
</P>
<P>
 Humphries shoved a black TV cameraman at the fire scene. "Why don't you get 
out of here?" he told Bill Gill of WVTM in Birmingham. 
</P>
<P>
 The camera captured the moment and recorded the approach of other men with 
Humphries, one of whom placed his hand on the lens and shoved. An unidentified 
voice is heard telling Gill: "You black sons of bitches burned this school." 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators were "99%" certain the early-morning blaze was arson, Sheriff 
Larry Colley said. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, it was Colley who grew angry with media attention to about 30 would-be 
marchers as they held hands, prayed and sang "We Shall Overcome." 
</P>
<P>
 "Where were you people this morning when Hulond Humphries was out there 
fighting that fire with his bare hands?" Colley said. "Where were these damn 
blacks?" 
</P>
<P>
 A new march was set for Aug. 20, said the Rev. Henry Sterling of the 
Leadership Conference. 
</P>
<P>
 Humphries' status has divided Wedowee, mostly along racial lines, since he 
told students in a Feb. 24 assembly that the prom would not be held because 
some interracial couples planned to attend.

VOLCANO ROBOT FALLS; AIRLIFT DUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By from Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The spider-like Dante II robot explorer toppled after breaking one of its 
eight legs and must be airlifted out of a volcanic crater strewn with boulders. 
</P>
<P>
 NASA scientists considered abandoning the $1.7-million robot but instead 
decided Saturday to try to have a helicopter lift it out of Mt.Spurr, where it 
lay on its side, its camera panning the terrain. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dante is still alive," said John Bares, a robotics expert from Carnegie 
Mellon University. 
</P>
<P>
 The remote-controlled robot had been sent into the 11,000-foot mountain July 
29 to test its ability to survive harsh environments. Scientists hope to one 
day use robots similar to Dante to explore other planets. 
</P>
<P>
 Dante lost its footing Friday night when one of its legs malfunctioned as it 
was climbing up the crater's slope, Bares said. 
</P>
<P>
 Scientists were moving the robot through the rugged boulder field when one of 
the front legs didn't respond to the commands about 400 feet from the crater 
rim. 
</P>
<P>
 "It pushed down too hard. We really don't know why," Bares said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dante might have been able to get up on its own, but the scientists decided 
instead to end the mission and fold up Dante's legs to make it as small as 
possible for the airlift. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've run a week longer than we intended -- and the mission accomplished more 
than we really hoped," Bares said. 
</P>
<P>
 They plan to pluck the 1,700-pound machine off Mt. Spurr, 80 miles west of 
Anchorage, on Monday.

LAB HANDLING SIMPSON DNA TESTS PREPARES FOR THE BATTLE AHEAD; COURTS: AS A 
LEADER IN COMMERCIALIZED GENETIC TESTING, CELLMARK DIAGNOSTICS' DIRECTOR KNOWS 
'IT'S GOING TO BE A DOGFIGHT.' HE ALSO SAYS HIS COMPANY IS READY TO DEFEND ITS 
PROCEDURES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Three thousand miles away from the bitter legal skirmishes over O.J. Simpson's 
fate, Mark D. Stolorow is quietly digging his own trenches for the upcoming 
battle. 
</P>
<P>
 Stolorow, director of Cellmark Diagnostics, the DNA fingerprint shop testing 
samples of Simpson's blood and hair, knows that the case could turn on the work 
-- and reputation -- of his company. 
</P>
<P>
 And he has seen an army of lawyers try to tear down Cellmark's credibility 
hundreds of times before. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know when we get to court, it's going to be a dogfight," he said in an 
interview with The Times. 
</P>
<P>
 But this particular dogfight -- the People of the State of California vs. 
Orenthal James Simpson -- promises to open Cellmark and the "genetic profiling" 
techniques it uses to closer scrutiny and harsher criticism than the firm has 
ever faced. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson's attorneys have assembled a team of seasoned DNA experts. When they 
come calling, Stolorow said, Cellmark will be ready. 
</P>
<P>
 The laboratory, nestled in an office park in this Maryland suburb 30 miles 
northwest of Washington, certainly is no stranger to the spotlight. After 
Cellmark analysts matched DNA samples from a Virginia man suspected of being 
"the Southside Strangler," he became the first person executed on the basis of 
DNA test results. When the Pentagon needed help identifying casualties of the 
Persian Gulf War, it turned to Cellmark. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors and defense attorneys have continued to rely on Cellmark even as 
they argue over its usefulness in the courtroom. The laboratory -- the first to 
commercialize DNA testing using a technique called restriction fragment length 
polymorphism (RFLP) -- handles about 10% of the country's 4,000 criminal cases 
involving DNA testing each year. Nationwide, DNA testing cases are split about 
50-50 between private and government labs. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Cellmark has developed a niche in the criminal forensic science 
field, its specialty is in high-quality testing for paternity cases, of which 
it handles about 1,500 each year. 
</P>
<P>
 Cellmark scientists have testified in more than 300 cases in 37 states, 
including California, and several other countries. But its expert testimony and 
its DNA tests do not come cheap. Each test costs about $550, and a case usually 
involves at least four tests. Hiring a Cellmark expert to testify in court runs 
about $1,200 per day. 
</P>
<P>
 Stolorow said it is worth the money and offered one reason why: Although the 
lab's statistical analyses have been thrown out of court on occasion, Cellmark 
has never been proven wrong with contradicting evidence from another 
laboratory. 
</P>
<P>
 "Is that trivial?" Stolorow asked. "I don't think so." 
</P>
<P>
 Proponents point to RFLP's high rate of certainty -- 999,999 chances in 1 
million, they say -- that two matching DNA samples are from the same person. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Simpson case comes as the young science of DNA fingerprinting is 
emerging from a recent flurry of academic and courtroom feuds over the value of 
what was once a Wunderkind legal tool. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, a National Academy of Sciences panel urged the nation's DNA 
laboratories to calculate more conservative probabilities when explaining to 
juries what a match means. On the heels of the panel's report, Cellmark and 
other testing centers came under fire from professors and attorneys who derided 
them for practicing an art, not a science. 
</P>
<P>
 Respected genetics scholars who once wielded incredible powers of persuasion 
over juries now face crucifixion on the witness stand. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our experts have been cross-examined so intensely that it makes me wonder why 
they came back," Stolorow said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Simpson case, Cellmark's scientists will face off against two opponents 
they have confronted before: New York attorneys Barry Scheck and Peter Neufeld, 
both of whom have tried to tarnish the credibility of DNA tests in court 
before. They have contended that Cellmark and other laboratories are 
error-prone and that the tests are statistically flawed. 
</P>
<P>
 Neufeld accompanied Dr. Henry Lee and Dr. Edward Blake, two defense 
scientists, to Cellmark recently to reserve 10% of Simpson's blood samples for 
possible future testing by another laboratory. 
</P>
<P>
 Scheck and Neufeld, who have called for national standards for DNA testing, 
have said Cellmark's results "can't be trusted." 
</P>
<P>
 But Stolorow said the two lawyers have argued both sides of the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are guys who have gone to the wall to say, 'Your honor, you've got to 
allow my client to have DNA testing,' " he said. "We've gone against these 
people over and over again." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, should the DNA results not link Simpson to the crime scene, another 
set of defense experts is poised to support the findings. 
</P>
<P>
 Cellmark is preparing to defend its credibility against attacks on several 
fronts. 
</P>
<P>
 "They tend to use the standard line, saying DNA testing is not reliable and 
that there are no national standards enforced," Stolorow said. 
</P>
<P>
 The laboratory is also anticipating questions about its "error rate" -- a 
proportion of tests that yield false readings. Each lab publishes its error 
rate in accordance with recommendations from the 1992 National Academy of 
Sciences report. Cellmark's error rate, as measured by a proficiency test, is 
under 0.5%. 
</P>
<P>
 Cellmark said this error rate indicates high precision, but critics disagree. 
"An error number of one in 200 is pretty damning evidence to have to fight," 
said Dan Krane, an Ohio DNA consultant who has worked on 20 cases, some 
involving Cellmark. 
</P>
<P>
 In a 1987 proficiency test designed by forensic scientists in California, the 
laboratory made a number of errors. Test administrators sent blood and semen 
samples to the DNA laboratories and found that Cellmark and some of its 
competitors mixed up the samples. Stolorow said the test was structured poorly 
and noted that in 300 samples examined for proficiency tests in the last five 
years, the lab has made no mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, the laboratory has changed its procedures. In the past, Cellmark 
used a small centrifuge to extract genetic material from the samples, put the 
material in separate test tubes and then combined the material in the tubes. 
Now it employs a larger centrifuge and requires its scientists to use only one 
tube to prevent accidental mixing. 
</P>
<P>
 Taking further steps to avoid inadvertent mixing, lab technicians also analyze 
DNA samples from a crime scene separately from those taken directly from the 
victims and the suspect. 
</P>
<P>
 Cellmark has insisted that all movements of DNA samples are witnessed by a 
second scientist, who watches for misnumbering of tubes or other errors. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson's defense experts may also grill Cellmark about the statistical 
methods it uses to develop its conclusions about DNA samples. 
</P>
<P>
 To beat back those questions, the laboratory will calculate its results using 
both its own statistical method and that recommended by the National Academy of 
Sciences -- the closest thing to a national standard. 
</P>
<P>
 What remains to be seen is whether it will be enough. 
</P>
<P>
 Former FBI laboratory director John W. Hicks said he believes it will. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cellmark is very highly regarded," said Hicks, who will soon be heading to 
the Alabama Department of Forensic Sciences. "They have been very responsive to 
the scientific community." 
</P>
<P>
 Others say the laboratory may have to do better. 
</P>
<P>
 If the DNA test matches Simpson's blood with samples from the crime scene, 
"the defense is going to dig in their heels and say that Cellmark made a 
mistake," Krane said. "It's a respectable organization, but just like the 
others, they are subject to human error."

WOODFORDE, BECKER IN FINAL; TENNIS: KRAJICEK, THE DEFENDING CHAMPION, AND 
STOLTENBERG ELIMINATED IN SEMIFINALS OF L.A. OPEN.

<P>
 Richard Krajicek dropped his racket and stood staring at his hand in 
disbelief. Sweat poured down his red, contorted face. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't supposed to happen this way. Not at the Los Angeles Open, in which 
Krajicek had not lost in the last two years. 
</P>
<P>
 But here he was, staring at the hand that, unbelievably, had just failed him. 
It had gripped his racket, which had sent the ball flying across the court, 
where it landed beyond the opposite baseline to set up break point for Mark 
Woodforde, 40-15. 
</P>
<P>
 Krajicek regrouped and slipped his 13th ace of the match past Woodforde to 
make it 40-30. 
</P>
<P>
 But then, it happened again. Krajicek slammed a forehand into the net, giving 
Woodforde break point. 
</P>
<P>
 Woodforde held serve in the next game for a 6-3, 3-6, 6-3 semifinal victory 
Saturday that ended Krajicek's chance to win his third-consecutive title. 
</P>
<P>
 Woodforde's victory ensures that Don Budge and Fred Perry will remain the only 
players to win the tournament three consecutive years. 
</P>
<P>
 Woodforde, who is unseeded, will play in the final today at 4 p.m. against 
second-seeded Boris Becker, who defeated sixth-seeded Jason Stoltenberg, 6-4, 
6-4, in the other semifinal on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Krajicek, a 6-foot-5, hard-serving 22-year old from the Netherlands, defeated 
Woodforde in the 1992 final. Krajicek, ranked 25th, was seeded fifth this year 
and did not lose a set before his semifinal. 
</P>
<P>
 Woodforde, known more for his doubles prowess than as a singles player, showed 
early that he meant business. 
</P>
<P>
 Trailing, 4-2, in the second set, Krajicek misplayed a volley and turned to 
walk away, seeing that Woodforde was set up for a slam. Woodforde raised his 
racket and sent the ball whizzing past Krajicek's ear. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I had wanted to hit him, I could have," Woodforde said. "It was just to 
warn him that I was going to be fighting for every point." 
</P>
<P>
 Krajicek won the set with a forehand volley that he aimed at Woodforde's body. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's got a racket in his hands, he can protect himself," Krajicek said. 
</P>
<P>
 The two exchanged words after the set, but both said that no animosity 
lingers. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was just a bit of bantering," Woodforde said. "It doesn't make Richard a 
bad guy and it doesn't make me a horrible person, either. It is just part and 
parcel of tennis." 
</P>
<P>
 Woodforde, of Australia, is currently ranked No. 53. He has won four singles 
titles -- at Auckland in 1986, two at Adelaide, in 1988 and 1989, and one at 
Philadelphia in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 But Woodforde has had far more success in doubles, and following today's 
singles final, Woodforde will play in the doubles final with partner John 
Fitzgerald, also of Australia. 
</P>
<P>
 Woodforde was the top-ranked doubles player in the world in 1992 and currently 
is ranked eighth in doubles. 
</P>
<P>
 His list of doubles titles is impressive -- the U.S. Open in 1989 with John 
McEnroe; the Australian Open in 1992 with Todd Woodbridge, and Wimbledon in 
1993 with Woodbridge. 
</P>
<P>
 Woodforde has a chance to make his name known as a singles player today 
against Becker. 
</P>
<P>
 Becker, ranked 11th, easily defeated 26th-ranked Stoltenberg of Australia, 
never facing a break point. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I started a little flat and Boris got on a roll," Stoltenberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 With the score tied, 4-4, in the second set, Becker hit a backhand passing 
shot down the left sideline to break Stoltenberg. Becker held serve in the next 
game, winning after Stoltenberg returned Becker's backhand drop shot into the 
net. 
</P>
<P>
 Becker aggravated the tendinitis in his right leg and withdrew from the 
doubles tournament on Friday, after he defeated eighth-seeded Karsten Braasch 
of Germany in a singles quarterfinal. Becker's injury did not appear to bother 
him on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Becker, three-time Wimbledon champion, and Woodforde have never met.

GORDON PREVAILS IN BRICKYARD 400; AUTO RACING: INDIANAPOLIS-AREA DRIVER, 23, 
HAD ALWAYS DREAMED OF RACING AT THE MOTOR SPEEDWAY. 
</P>

 The Good Ol' Boys of NASCAR brought their stock car show to the home of the 
Indianapolis 500 for the first time Saturday, only to have a slip of a youth 
from Indiana steal the show. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Gordon, who turned 23 Thursday and grew up dreaming of racing in the 500, 
fought off Rusty Wallace and Ernie Irvan in one of the most exciting finishes 
in Indianapolis Motor Speedway's storied history to win the Brickyard 400. 
</P>
<P>
 Six lead changes, Wallace from Gordon, Gordon back again, Irvan from Gordon, 
Gordon back again, then Irvan again and Gordon for the final time when Irvan 
had a flat tire, kept the sellout crowd of nearly 300,000 on its feet through 
the final 28 laps of the inaugural Winston Cup race. 
</P>
<P>
 Gordon earned a NASCAR record $613,000, more than double the previous record 
of $294,450 won by Kyle Petty in 1990 at Rockingham, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
 "To me, this is the Indy 500 for stock car racing," said Gordon, who lives in 
Pittsboro, a suburb of Indianapolis. "When I went to 
</P>
<P>
 NASCAR (from open-wheeled racing), I pretty much felt like my shot at driving 
at Indianapolis was gone. I thought I'd kissed it goodby. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then to come here in a stock car and win, it's the greatest thing that's ever 
happened to me. I had to take an extra lap to let my emotions go, I was yelling 
so loud over the radio. I didn't want to come in and hyperventilate like I did 
at Charlotte." 
</P>
<P>
 Gordon won his first Winston Cup race last May 28, the Coca-Cola 600 at 
Charlotte, N.C., the same day as the Indianapolis 500, and was so overcome with 
emotion that he collapsed during the post-race celebrating. 
</P>
<P>
 At the end Saturday, the race came down to a Chevrolet vs. Ford duel between 
two drivers who spent their formative years in Northern California, Gordon in 
Vallejo and Irvan in Salinas. Gordon's family moved to Pittsboro after Jeff was 
barred from racing professionally in California because he was too young. 
</P>
<P>
 "The way Ernie and me were swapping the lead, if his tire hadn't gone down, we 
would have come right down to the checkered flag side by side," Gordon said. 
</P>
<P>
 Brett Bodine, after surviving a tag-team duel with brother Geoff in a family 
feud played out at 180 m.p.h., finished second, .53 seconds behind. Bill 
Elliott, Wallace, Dale Earnhardt, Darrell Waltrip, Ken Schrader, Michael 
Waltrip, Todd Bodine and Morgan Shepherd followed as only 9.3 seconds separated 
the first and 10th finishers. 
</P>
<P>
 Gordon led 93 of the 160 laps after taking the lead from pole-sitter Rick Mast 
on the second lap when Earnhardt, the six-time series champion and pre-race 
favorite, scraped the wall in the fourth turn and had to pit for new tires. 
</P>
<P>
 Thirteen drivers led and A.J. Foyt almost made it 14. Foyt was running second, 
behind Ted Musgrave, waiting for the leader to pit. But Foyt miscalculated and 
ran out of gas. By the time he coasted in, he had lost a lap and was never 
again a factor in what was his 36th race at Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
 Four accidents kept the average speed down to 131.932 m.p.h. as 25 laps were 
run under caution, but the accident involving the Bodine brothers did the most 
damage -- physically and sociologically. 
</P>
<P>
 Brett Bodine had taken the lead on lap 96 when brother Geoff came up behind 
him, gave him a tap and then drove underneath to take the lead. Once he got 
ahead, however, he seemed to hesitate and Brett hit him in the rear end. 
</P>
<P>
 Geoff's Ford started to lose traction and when he tried to make a correction, 
the 3,800-pound car got away from him. It first hit the wall, then rebounded in 
the middle of the track and did a complete spin. Only Dale Jarrett got caught 
in the tangle as the rest of the field escaped, a number of them by driving 
down the pit road. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are in the midst of a personal feud and he (Brett) took it out on the race 
track," Geoff Bodine said. "I still love him, but he spun me out.' 
</P>
<P>
 Said Brett: "My car got loose and I got into him. That's all. No way I would 
ever do anything deliberate on the race track. I was trying to win this race, 
that's all. He got into me and got by and when I tried to get back by, I got 
into him. I got into the gas hard, he must have left off, and I ran into the 
back of him." 
</P>
<P>
 The third and youngest Bodine brother, Todd, had another family view: "They're 
supposed to race clean, but they're just big babies. If they want to be jerks, 
they can be jerks. That's what they were today. I ain't a part of the feud." 
</P>
<P>
 Geoff led 24 laps, Brett 10 and Todd one, marking the first time three 
brothers had led the same Winston Cup race. 
</P>
<P>
 Darrell Waltrip, who races against brother Michael, said such shenanigans 
wouldn't go in the Waltrip family. 
</P>
<P>
 "If me and Michael did that, Leroy (their father) would be waiting for us when 
we got out of our race car."

<P>
 Gordon's closest brush with disaster came with Geoff Bodine on lap 66. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was getting ready to come in (the pits) and Geoff was coming out," Gordon 
said. "I knew he was going to be faster than me, because he had on new tires. I 
waved my hand to let him know I was coming into the pits, but I don't know what 
he was thinking. He tried to go to the inside and that's where I was. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was very close. We actually rubbed, and it bent our left front fender. It 
could have been real bad, but when it wasn't, that's when you know it's your 
day, that the guy upstairs is on your side."

BUSINESS AS USUAL FOR RAMS; PRO FOOTBALL: WILD PASSES, ILL-TIMED PENALTIES AND 
POOR OFFENSE BRING 14-6 LOSS TO PACKERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The Rams, flashing midseason form, threw wild passes, were called for 
penalties that wiped out successful plays and failed to score a touchdown in a 
14-6 loss Saturday to the Green Bay Packers at Camp Randall Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams, who were 5-11 last season after losing all four exhibitions, were 
unable to overcome the Packers' first drive in the exhibition opener for both 
teams. 
</P>
<P>
 Quarterback Brett Favre, who never had the chance to respond to the Rams' 
off-season offer of $20 million for five years because of the sudden signing of 
Chris Miller, ran twice for 14 yards and completed all four passes during a 
12-play, 69-yard scoring drive. 
</P>
<P>
 Running back Edgar Bennett carried the final yard for the touchdown, kicker 
Chris Jacke adding the decisive extra point with 7:54 remaining in the first 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought the offense operated with a lot of precision for a first game," 
Packer Coach Mike Holmgren said. "I would like to start every game that way." 
</P>
<P>
 The Packers have something to look forward to: They play the Rams again in 
Green Bay on Oct. 9. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't win the football game, which is the bad news," Ram Coach Chuck Knox 
said, "but the good news is I think we can profit by some of the mistakes we 
made." 
</P>
<P>
 Some of those blunders included: 
</P>
<P>
 -- A Leo Goeas holding penalty wiping out a 20-yard pass from Chris Chandler 
to Nate Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A Chandler pass from the Green Bay 11-yard line intended for Chris Brantley 
at the five, but instead intercepted by safety Tim Hauck. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A dropped pass by Travis McNeal, leaving the team's tight ends without a 
catch in the game. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A four-for-13 performance on third-down conversions. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A kickoff coverage team giving up an average return of 28 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Rookie tackle Wayne Gandy's inability to deter Sean Jones from joining 
Reggie White to blast Chandler and force a fumble. 
</P>
<P>
 "Getting beat is not a thing that I'm worried about," Ram offensive line coach 
Jim Erkenbeck said. "I'm worried about whether he takes the steps to improve 
himself. If he got beat because he was . . . incompetent or a sportswriter, 
then I would probably be very discouraged." 
</P>
<P>
 A crowd of 52,149 watched the Packers take on the Rams minus Miller and 
running back Jerome Bettis. Miller said he will be ready to practice Monday, 
but he was kept out of the game because of a sore abdominal muscle. The Rams 
are saving Bettis for games that count. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams also chose not to use Johnny Bailey on kickoff and punt returns, but 
for a glimpse of what is to come, they included him in their offensive attack 
and he ran 12 times for 37 yards and caught two passes for 65 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think when we put it all together," Bailey said, "we're going to have a 
pretty good football team." 
</P>
<P>
 The Packers' starting units, however, outscored the Rams, 7-3, and in the 
battle between reserves, they also prevailed, 7-3. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first order of business was to give the young players an opportunity to 
play without being obstructed by all kinds of intricate formations," said Chick 
Harris, the Rams' new offensive coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
 Presumably, the Rams will incorporate plays with touchdown potential in 
Saturday's exhibition against the Patriots at Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope we can do that," Harris said. "We can add some things to make it a 
little better." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams, however, will have to be a lot better to scare the opposition. 
Chandler, who will back up Miller this season, was nine for 18 for 149 yards 
and failed to get the team into the end zone after twice moving inside the 
Packers' 20. 
</P>
<P>
 Chandler had the Rams at the Packer eight on third and goal in the second 
quarter, but his pass for Jessie Hester came closer to hitting a fan in the 
stands. On the team's next possession, Chandler had the Rams at the Packer 11, 
before making Hauck a hero. 
</P>
<P>
 "That looked like his only bad play," said Mike Martz, Ram quarterbacks coach. 
"I thought Chandler did a lot of good things under pressure, and his decision 
making was really very good." 
</P>
<P>
 The decision to pass in Hauck's vicinity with 27 seconds left in the half, 
however, sabotaged the Rams' prospects for momentum and a halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a play they (coaching staff) used a lot in Seattle with Steve 
Largent," Chandler said. "It's a route, though, you have to work a lot. It's 
such a timing-feeling thing between quarterback and receiver. That's why they 
make us play so many preseason games." 
</P>
<P>
 Chandler, who fumbled after being hit by Jones and White on the first play of 
the second quarter, fumbled again near the end of the quarter. Defensive end 
Matt LaBounty got the ball and ran into the end zone. A penalty for illegal use 
of hands, however, on cornerback Lenny McGill wiped out the touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams trailed, 7-3, at the half after a 26-yard Tony Zendejas field goal. 
</P>
<P>
 Packer wide receiver Robert Brooks beat Todd Lyght's coverage to catch a 
two-yard touchdown pass from Ty Detmer to cap a 78-yard, 12-play drive for a 
14-3 lead with 7:38 left in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Zendejas kicked a 29-yard field goal after a Wymon Henderson interception to 
bring the Rams within a touchdown and two-point conversion of tying the score, 
but then Jamie Martin was at quarterback in place of Chandler. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin, who did not play in any games last season, misfired on his first five 
passes before finishing six for 17 for 62 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought, given his limited experience," Knox said, "Martin went in there 
and did some things." 
</P>
<P>
 While not exactly an overwhelming endorsement, Martin did move the Rams to the 
Packer 45 with 1:38 to play. But on fourth and one, his pass to Turhon O'Bannon 
was too high and behind the receiver and fell incomplete.

JIM MURRAY: TENNIS STILL HAS HIM ON A STRING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM MURRAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Tennis, which used to be the most formful of sports, has become the least. 
Like golf it has gone from Who's Who to Who in the World's That? 
</P>
<P>
 The top seeds never sprout. When Big Bill Tilden, or Donald Budge or Rod Laver 
took the court, the outcome was a foregone conclusion. Today, it's about as 
foregone as a lottery. 
</P>
<P>
 Take this week's Los Angeles Open at the UCLA Tennis Center. The promoters 
shelled out hundreds of thousands of dollars to deck their draw with 
recognizable names like Michael Chang, Andre Agassi and Boris Becker. By 
Friday, only Becker was left. And, even for Boris, his nickname has gone from 
"Boom Boom" to " Auf Wiedersehen ," from marquee to small print. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1985 when a young redheaded German who played tennis like a guy diving off 
cliffs shockingly and convincingly won Wimbledon at the age of a mere 17, the 
tennis world was stunned. Rubbed its eyes. Only the year before, Becker was 
ranked No. 65 in the world. The year before that, he was 563rd. 
</P>
<P>
 He was the youngest player to win Wimbledon. And, until then, the only German. 
</P>
<P>
 He was an imposing physical specimen, not quite Schwarzenegger but close 
enough, 6 feet 3, 190 pounds. He played a game that was just this side of 
awesome and the temptation for us knights of the press to call it blitzkrieg or 
to liken his advance through the seeds to the German army going through the low 
countries was irresistible. The tennis establishment quickly frowned on any 
military application of his actions. They even protested the nickname "Boom 
Boom." But the facts of the matter were, this appellation was fixed on him by 
those of us who remembered an old baseball pitcher named Walter Beck, who was 
dubbed "Boom Boom" in honor of the sound his pitches made when batters bounced 
them off the old tin fence in Philadelphia's Baker Field. It fit 
alliteratively, not militarily. 
</P>
<P>
 But whatever you called Becker, the reality was, he was the German High 
Command of Tennis. 
</P>
<P>
 His game was not only effective, it was thrilling. He pulverized the ball, he 
chased it down with the abandon of a hawk after a mouse. He flew, he charged 
the net, he was a flame on center court. He was aground more often than Exxon 
Valdez, in the air more than the Luftwaffe. He ended a match looking like 
something that had fallen into a rose bush or backed into a cactus plant. 
</P>
<P>
 He won Wimbledon three times in five years and was a finalist six times in 
seven years. Only Bjorn Borg could match numbers like those and Borg so to 
speak set fire to himself doing it. 
</P>
<P>
 Did Becker? Well, unlike Borg, who never did, he won a U.S. Open. He added an 
Australian Open. He was a picture on a lot of walls. 
</P>
<P>
 Then he didn't win anything. At least, anything of any importance. Even 
Wimbledon eluded him. 
</P>
<P>
 His serve didn't lose velocity, just accuracy. He played with the same 
heavy-legged lunge at the ball, but most matches would find him throwing his 
head skyward and screaming imprecations in German over missed chances or 
unforced errors. 
</P>
<P>
 He came to the L.A. Open this week at great expense to management, and some 
wise guys were prepared to cover their eyes. And, suddenly, in a second-round 
match against his countryman, Karsten Braasch, it looked as if they were right. 
Becker had lost at least one of his Booms. He became a baby Boomer. The score 
for him was 2-6, 0-3 when Braasch realized who was on the other side of the 
net. "Well, yes, it was Boris Becker," he said. "And when he thought he had 
lost the match, he calmed down and began to play like he can." 
</P>
<P>
 In other words, he got the Boom back. He got back into the tournament, 2-6, 
7-6, 6-2. I won't say Braasch was nervous -- but he double-faulted away his own 
match point, the tennis equivalent of walking in the winning run. 
</P>
<P>
 Boom Boom earned the right to play Jason Stoltenberg, whoever he is, in the 
semifinals. Nobody ever called him Boom Boom. And he lost to the real Boom 
Boom, 6-4, 6-4, Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Becker surveyed his career after the Braasch match. He's only 26, why should 
his best tennis be behind him? "Well," he began, "you have to remember when I 
came in the game 10 years ago, I brought the power game into the equation. They 
were playing a more mechanical, more mathematical game. I played a game they 
hadn't seen in a while. They called me Boom Boom, you know." 
</P>
<P>
 We know. 
</P>
<P>
 He seems to play a game where he is bored until it becomes desperate. Is that 
correct? Becker shakes his head. "It's not that I'm a slow starter. It's that I 
am usually the favorite. The other guy has nothing to lose. He comes out all 
guns firing. I have always played difficult matches." 
</P>
<P>
 Well, maybe he doesn't dive for balls any more? "I do pick my surface," Becker 
acknowledged. "I may dive for a ball indoors but I check for hardness first." 
</P>
<P>
 The old Becker would dive off the Empire State Building at the drop of a 
volley. 
</P>
<P>
 He's only 26. In any other sport, a 26-year-old is just starting out. But 
tennis almost invented the word burnout. How come? 
</P>
<P>
 "No off-season," Becker says quickly. "We have a racket in our hands 12 months 
a year. The pressure is constant. Borg retires at age 25 but he has had a 
racket in his hand for 12 years by then." 
</P>
<P>
 Well, of course, plumbers have a wrench in their hands for 40 years, an Arnold 
Palmer has had a golf club in his hands for 50, a miner has a pick and shovel. 
Maybe after three Wimbledons and two other Grand Slam event victories, the 
burning desire flames out? 
</P>
<P>
 "I still have the burning desire," Becker insists. "I still intend to win, to 
improve. You have to improve or the game passes you." 
</P>
<P>
 Now that Pete Sampras has succeeded him as the-man-to-beat in the game, does 
he accept the secondary role? "I intend to bother Mr. Sampras," the Boomer 
assures you.

MIKE DOWNEY: TOCCHET, TALKS IT, SKATES IT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE DOWNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 By giving up Luc Robitaille for Rick Tocchet, I get a feeling that hockey fans 
think the Kings traded one of the Little Rascals for one of the Hell's Angels. 
The big July 30 deal has infuriated scores of fans, some of whom doggedly 
insist that Hockey Night in California will never be the same.  
</P>
<P>
 Robitaille was a hell of a hockey player. He was a lamplighter and a good kid 
and we practically watched him grow up. However, I feel a very strong urge to 
clarify something about Tocchet for everyone who has conveniently chosen to 
ignore or overlook it -- excuse me, but this guy can play . 
</P>
<P>
 You'll like Rick Tocchet. Trust me. 
</P>
<P>
 On the phone from his home in Philadelphia, where his backache is getting 
better every day, Tocchet (as in sock it ) said: "My first reaction to the 
trade was that I'd better perform, because Luc's a pretty popular player out 
there. But I'm a little cocky. I don't mean to put Luc down. But I know I can 
help that team. If I'm healthy, I could chip in 40 goals, no problem." 
</P>
<P>
 When he got the news, Tocchet, 30, was watching TV in a friend's bar with two 
former teammates, defenseman Kerry Huffman of the Ottawa Senators and left wing 
Brian Propp of the Hartford Whalers. They had played together in Philly before 
a big trade in 1992 (involving the Kings) ended up sending Tocchet to the 
Pittsburgh Penguins, with whom he promptly won a Stanley Cup.  
</P>
<P>
 Huffman turned to Tocchet, overjoyed.  
</P>
<P>
 "Los Angeles!" Huffman said. "Can I go with you?" 
</P>
<P>
 Tocchet had an inkling he was going somewhere. His contract had expired. 
During the 1992-93 season, his hockey numbers had been career bests -- 48 
goals, 61 assists, seven more goals in the playoffs. Naturally, his penalty 
minutes were high, too, because Rick Tocchet spends more time inside penalty 
boxes than goldfish spend in bowls. But he had 20 power-play goals and four 
more short-handed. He had points in 64 of Pittsburgh's 80 scheduled games. Like 
I said, the guy can play.  
</P>
<P>
 A back operation, though, after the 1993-94 season put his Penguin future in 
doubt. The club already had enough on its mind with Mario Lemieux planning to 
sit out the next season. Tocchet was plenty tough. His jaw was broken one night 
at Chicago in the second period but he returned for the third period anyway, 
scored twice, and Pittsburgh won, 4-3.  
</P>
<P>
 "My mom cried after that," Tocchet remembered.  
</P>
<P>
 He gave the Penguins everything he had. But word was out that he was being 
shopped. Tocchet gave management a short list of preferred destinations, with 
L.A. on it. At no time, he wants it made clear, did Wayne Gretzky ever tell him 
that he would intercede on Tocchet's behalf. But when the trade went down, 
stories spread that Gretzky had all but snapped his fingers and made Robitaille 
disappear. 
</P>
<P>
 "From what I've heard, it's been very unfair," Tocchet said. "Wayne Gretzky 
has a presence on and off the ice, yes. But he never, ever said to me anything 
like, 'We're going to get you.' 
</P>
<P>
 "If it were any other player, I doubt there'd be a reaction like this. I 
guarantee you, Mario Lemieux gets called in and consulted. He gets asked what 
he thinks of a player before there's a trade. Heck, even I'd get asked. Don't 
you think a Wayne Gretzky or a Mario Lemieux might be entitled to make a 
suggestion now and then? I do." 
</P>
<P>
 Tocchet had a conversation the other day with Paul Coffey, the ex-King, 
ex-Penguin with whom he now had something in common. Coffey told him not many 
players get a chance to play with both Gretzky and Lemieux in their careers, 
and few more ever will. Gretzky's back pushed him to the brink of retirement, 
and Lemieux is an outpatient with Hodgkin's disease.  
</P>
<P>
 Is Lemieux's career over? 
</P>
<P>
 "For this year, definitely. It's hard for me to say beyond that," Tocchet 
said. "I could see where trying to come back every couple of months could take 
a toll on him. I can see him getting as far away from hockey as possible to 
think everything over." 
</P>
<P>
 Tocchet will be teamed with Gretzky, who can use all the hitters around him he 
can get, and re-teamed with Marty McSorley, who was more or less a Penguin 
temp. He also thinks the Kings have a couple more changes yet to make. His 
back, not quite 100% yet, is healing properly, and Tocchet prefers to stay in 
Philadelphia a while longer before moving here with his girlfriend. L.A. loses 
someone special, yes. But it is not gaining some goon. Tocchet has 11 hat 
tricks. He's had four-goal games three times.  
</P>
<P>
 "The Kings are changing with the times," he said. "You look at the teams that 
reached the finals, Vancouver is big and tough and so are the Rangers. So 
naturally the Kings are looking to be more physical. It's in me to score 50 to 
55 goals if that's what they need. I just don't think that's what they're 
looking for from me.  
</P>
<P>
 "I always looked forward to going to Los Angeles. To be perfectly honest, we 
never gave them much respect early on. The Kings were not that good, let's face 
it. We'd say, 'OK, let's get two points and party.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Do teams respect the Kings now? 
</P>
<P>
 Good question, Tocchet agreed.  
</P>
<P>
 He said: "They'd better."

ANDERSEN'S EARLY WORK PAYS OFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JODY BERGER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Lisa Andersen performed radical moves early and used sound strategy late in 
the 45-minute final on Saturday to win the U.S. Open of Surfing. 
</P>
<P>
 In 3- to 5-foot surf, Andersen defeated former world champion Frieda Zamba, 
who won the Op Pro last weekend. Both events were held at the Huntington Beach 
Pier. 
</P>
<P>
 Zamba, 29, took off on fewer waves in the beginning of the heat in an effort 
to pace herself. Andersen was less selective and surfed aggressively on the 
small waves she caught. 
</P>
<P>
 With 10 minutes left in the heat, Andersen had taken 14 waves, one short of 
the total each surfer is allowed. She paddled around the priority buoy and 
positioned herself close to Zamba. 
</P>
<P>
 Zamba needed to score 7.33, which would be tough for some surfers. Zamba, from 
Flagler Beach, Fla., already had done it in this contest with combinations of 
floaters and slashing turns. But with Andersen beside her and no sets coming 
in, even Zamba couldn't manage a high-scoring ride. 
</P>
<P>
 "I may have been too picky early," Zamba said, who was exhausted at the end. 
</P>
<P>
 The wind picked up and the current headed toward the pier. Both surfers had to 
paddle throughout the heat to stay in position. After a long ride toward the 
pier, Zamba left the water and ran down the beach to where the waves were 
breaking. 
</P>
<P>
 Once Andersen heard she had 14 waves, all she did was paddle. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the back of my mind I thought, 'I'm not really pleasing the crowd,' " she 
said of her decision to stay close to Zamba. 
</P>
<P>
 "You really have to play the game with her," Andersen said. "I know she has 
potential to get a nine at any time." 
</P>
<P>
 The leader on the world championship tour, Andersen has won two events and 
finished second three times in five contests this year. Originally from Ormond 
Beach, Fla., she lives in Florianopolis, Brazil, with her husband and 
1-year-old daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 In the longboarding final, Colin McPhillips of San Clemente used the quick 
cutbacks and vertical maneuvers of shortboard riders to beat Joel Tudor of 
Cardiff. 
</P>
<P>
 Tudor, who uses more traditional longboard moves such as nose rides, would 
have won anyway if he hadn't paddled into one of McPhillips' waves. The 
interference call cost him one wave score. Judges counted only four of Tudor's 
waves instead of the usual five for final heats. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a stupid move and I paid the price," Tudor said. The loss snapped his 
eight-contest winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
 McPhillips, 19, was surprised to hear the interference call. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was the normal paddling hassles," he said. "It was a battle between Joel 
and me." 
</P>
<P>
 It was McPhillips' first major victory. He started surfing professionally two 
years ago and has made the quarterfinals and semifinals a couple of times. He 
believed he was due for a victory, but was stoked it happened in such an 
important contest in front of an estimated crowd of 35,000. 
</P>
<P>
 In men's surfing, wild-cards Richie Collins and Jeff Deffenbaugh continued to 
eliminate seeded surfers. Newport Beach's Collins, who has surfed the world 
tour in the past, beat Stuart Bedford-Brown of Australia and will face Sunny 
Garcia of Waianae, Hawaii, at 9 a.m. today in the first quarterfinal heat. 
</P>
<P>
 Deffenbaugh of Huntington Beach surfed aggressively and used the priority buoy 
to defeat Australia's Matt Hoy. Deffenbaugh will face Michael Barry of 
Australia in the fourth quarterfinal. 
</P>
<P>
 Shane Beschen of San Clemente and Australia's Dave Macaulay meet up in the 
second heat. Kelly Slater of Cocoa Beach, Fla., faces Damien Hardman of 
Australia in the third. Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Today's schedule: 8-9 a.m. -- Bodyboarding semifinals; 9-11 a.m. -- Men's 
quarterfinals; 11 a.m.-12 p.m. -- Men's semifinals; 12-12:45 p.m. -- 
Bodyboarding final; 12:45-1:30 -- Men's final; 9 a.m.-5 p.m. -- U.S. Open Beach 
Expo; 2-4 p.m. -- Award ceremonies.

CHICAGO OUTLASTS THE ANGELS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB NIGHTENGALE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There are privileges that go with being a major league player, benefits that 
aren't available to others. 
</P>
<P>
 Rarely do you have to pay for a round of golf. Never do you have to buy your 
own tennis shoes. And you can earn a few thousand dollars by attending a 
baseball card show. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago White Sox right fielder Darrin Jackson plans to utilize his status for 
a different purpose. 
</P>
<P>
 He seeks justice. 
</P>
<P>
 "The pain is still there," Jackson said Saturday before the marathon 
Angel-White Sox game, which Chicago won in 10 innings, 16-10, after midnight. 
"And I'm not about to let it go." 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson's nephew, Jaime Apolonia Moreno, was murdered June 12 in Los Angeles 
at his sister-in-law's home. Jackson, who doubled and scored the winning run on 
Saturday, said the family knows who committed the stabbing. There were 
witnesses, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, the investigation has only recently commenced and no charges have been 
filed. Yvonne Brathwaite Burke of the Board of Supervisors of the Second 
District said she has been apprised of the case, and the Los Angeles District 
Attorney's office and homicide detectives are investigating. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want this case to be treated as just another minority killing in 
South Central," said Jackson, born and raised in Los Angeles. "That's why I'm 
keeping on them. I don't want this case to just die. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was a beautiful man we're talking about, and I'm not going to just sit 
here and let the D.A.'s office dismiss this thing. And I'm afraid that if our 
family wasn't constantly keeping on them, it would be. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm telling you if there's a strike, you'll be seeing me and (his wife) 
Darlene on the courthouse steps, demanding some action. We're not going away." 
</P>
<P>
 On the field, Jackson continues to use his clout in the White Sox's bid for a 
second consecutive division championship. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, the Angels hit five home runs in the first seven innings -- two 
apiece by J.T. Snow and Tim Salmon, and one by Chili Davis -- before 35,589 at 
Anaheim Stadium. While the White Sox's pitching was miserable, the Angels 
showed they can be just as bad, surrendering 17 hits and a team-record tying 13 
walks. 
</P>
<P>
 The White Sox were one out away from winning in the ninth, leading, 10-9. But 
Bo Jackson's grounder was thrown away by Robin Ventura, and pinch-runner Harold 
Reynolds scored from second when Greg Myers followed with a single to center. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 10th, Darrin Jackson led off with a double, moved to third on a 
groundout by Lance Johnson and scored on Joey Cora's single. 
</P>
<P>
 Ozzie Guillen then doubled to left off Mark Leiter (4-6), scoring Cora. Mike 
LaValliere followed with a single to right to score Guillen. 
</P>
<P>
 Angel reliever Jeff Schwarz typified the pitching problems, walking two 
batters with the bases loaded without throwing a strike in the fifth inning. He 
wound up throwing 22 pitches, 18 balls, and walked four batters in two-thirds 
of an inning. 
</P>
<P>
 But he was nearly upstaged by White Sox reliever Scott Sanderson in the 
seventh. He threw only 10 pitches, but still managed to yield back-to-back home 
runs by Davis and Salmon. 
</P>
<P>
 It hardly was amusing to the White Sox, who need all of the help they can get 
to stay atop the American League Central until the Aug. 12 strike date. They 
lead the Cleveland Indians by a half game, and the Kansas City Royals by two 
games. 
</P>
<P>
 It would be an entirely different story, of course, if the White Sox still 
resided in the AL West. They would have an 11 1/2-game lead in the West and 
would already be selling playoff tickets. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are the most important games of the whole season," said pitcher Wilson 
Alvarez. "There's a lot of pressure on us, there's a lot of pressure on 
everybody."

RAIDERS HAVE A FULL HOUSE IN BACKFIELD; PRO FOOTBALL: VETERANS, FREE AGENTS AND 
A ROOKIE ARE COMPETING AT RESTOCKED FULLBACK AND TAILBACK POSITIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE SPRINGER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One has the experience, one has the potential and one has the job. 
</P>
<P>
 For now. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Raiders take the field tonight in Texas Stadium for their exhibition 
game against the Dallas Cowboys, the starting tailback will be Ty Montgomery, 
with Harvey Williams on the second unit and Calvin Jones on the third. 
</P>
<P>
 That's not the pecking order most observers envisioned for the tailback spot, 
and indeed, it's not expected to be that way on opening day. 
</P>
<P>
 The situation is much the same at fullback, where Napoleon McCallum will be 
the starter tonight, followed by Tom Rathman and then Derrick Gainer and Randy 
Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
 It is assumed Williams and Rathman will begin the regular season as the 
starters for the Raiders on Sept. 5 against the San Francisco 49ers in a Monday 
night matchup at Candlestick Park. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders didn't sign Williams, a three-year veteran with the Kansas City 
Chiefs, or Rathman, an eight-year veteran with the 49ers, merely to keep their 
bench well stocked. The Raiders assured Rathman he'd be starting. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked about his plans, Coach Art Shell would only say: "Our starters are Ty 
Montgomery and Napoleon McCallum." 
</P>
<P>
 This is the Raider way. The team usually rewards loyalty, and Montgomery and 
McCallum were the only productive contributors to the ground game in last 
year's postseason. 
</P>
<P>
 Montgomery, a converted wide receiver, got his chance last year when leading 
rusher Greg Robinson suffered a knee injury and Nick Bell proved ineffective. 
</P>
<P>
 After gaining 106 yards in 37 carries during the regular season, Montgomery 
rushed for 72 yards in 24 carries and caught six passes -- a total second only 
to Tim Brown on the Raiders -- for 55 yards in the postseason games against the 
Denver Broncos and Buffalo Bills. 
</P>
<P>
 But to keep his starting job, Montgomery, who seems more effective as a 
flanker than as a ballcarrier, must hold off Williams, a natural tailback who 
rushed for 858 yards and averaged 3.9 a carry in his three years in Kansas City 
despite some stiff competition that kept him from becoming a full-time starter. 
</P>
<P>
 In Jones, their third-round draft choice and tailback of the future, the 
Raiders have the second-leading rusher in Nebraska history with 3,153 yards and 
40 touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 Tough crowd for Montgomery to run in. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ty is not gonna give it up easy," Shell said. "He's running hard." 
</P>
<P>
 McCallum fared well last season when he was brought off special teams and 
dropped into the Raider backfield because of the shortage of dependable 
players. 
</P>
<P>
 Not blessed with speed, McCallum did prove highly effective in short-yardage 
and goal-line situations, and this was something of a surprise considering that 
he had to weather a midseason appendectomy to stay in the lineup. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, after scoring only two rushing touchdowns in three previous 
seasons with the Raiders, most of which he spent on special teams, McCallum 
scored three in 1993 and five more in the two playoff games, when he was the 
Raiders' leading rusher with 137 yards for a 4.3-yard average. 
</P>
<P>
 But how do you bench Rathman, who started in two Super Bowls and is a capable 
rusher, receiver and blocker? 
</P>
<P>
 Coming off a season in which they were never sure where their next carry was 
coming from, it's a nice problem for the Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
 The other players to watch tonight as the Raiders attempt to maintain the 
momentum generated by last week's exhibition victory over the Denver Broncos: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Wide receiver James Jett, who will take advantage of the continued absence 
of starter Alexander Wright (pulled calf muscle) to try to win his job. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Defensive end Scott Davis, who will continue to work toward regaining his 
form after a two-year retirement. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Second-year man Greg Biekert and rookie Rob Fredrickson, who will resume 
their battle for the starting middle linebacker job. Raider Notes 
</P>
<P>
 The Cowboys are unbeaten under new Coach Barry Switzer, having defeated the 
Minnesota Vikings, 17-9, in their exhibition opener. . . . Dallas quarterback 
Troy Aikman picked up where he left off in the Super Bowl, completing all six 
of his passes. . . . Running back Emmitt Smith was held out of last week's game 
by Switzer to keep him fresh, but Smith might get in for a series or two 
tonight. . . . Not expected to play are defensive linemen Russell Maryland and 
Leon Lett, both suffering from injuries to the right ankle, receivers Michael 
Irvin (recovering from off-season shoulder surgery) and Alvin Harper (shoulder 
injury), running back Derrick Lassic (knee) and center Mark Stepnoski 
(recovering from knee surgery). Defensive lineman Charles Haley is doubtful 
because of a calf sprain.

MORNING BRIEFING: RANGERS NO LONGER STINK, BUT PARK DOES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EARL GUSTKEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Ballpark In Arlington, the Texas Rangers' $189-million stadium that opened 
last April, stinks.  
</P>
<P>
 And the stench seems to be most intense near the best seats in the house.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's so bad, it makes you want to check yourself every now and then," said a 
fan, Tom Malaise. 
</P>
<P>
 Ranger officials found the problem. Seems the residue of thousands of hot 
dogs, mustard, relish, onions, mayonnaise, beer, etc., gets washed into storm 
drains and rots in Texas heat.  
</P>
<P>
 For the time being, the Rangers have taped over the floor drains in each 
section. Later, a fan system will be installed to blow gases out of the drains. 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia time: Who was Louis Sockalexis? 
</P>
<P>
 Thinning: Remember Lincoln Kennedy, the All-American offensive lineman at 
Washington two seasons back? 
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy, 6-feet-6 and 280 pounds at Washington, showed up weighing 415 pounds 
at the Atlanta Falcons' mini-camp in June. The Falcons sent him for a 45-day 
stay at the Duke University weight loss center. 
</P>
<P>
 Update: With a new diet and a new appreciation for proper nutrition, he has 
slimmed down to 358 pounds. The Falcons say he'll "probably" start at offensive 
tackle. 
</P>
<P>
 Come again?: A TV commentator called the Brickyard 400 race "the most 
significant auto racing event in this century." 
</P>
<P>
 Hmmm. Guess that eliminates the Indy 500. 
</P>
<P>
 Hail to the Duke: Duke Kahanamoku, inducted posthumously into the Surfing Walk 
of Fame in Huntington Beach on Thursday, was enjoying a picnic with a group of 
Hollywood actors near the entrance to Newport Harbor on June 14, 1925. 
</P>
<P>
 After a day of surfing, the group fell asleep on the beach, but were awakened 
by the cries of a friend, Mary Grigsby, above the cliffs. A pleasure boat had 
capsized offshore. 
</P>
<P>
 Kahanamoku, known as the father of surfing, paddled a board toward the wreck. 
He saved eight of 12 survivors. Seventeen others died. 
</P>
<P>
 Milestone: Twenty-five years ago this week, the Pittsburgh Pirates' Willie 
Stargell hit a Dodger Stadium home run that cleared the right field pavilion. 
He did it again in 1973. Stargell is still the only player to hit a ball out of 
Dodger Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia answer: The man for whom the Cleveland Indians are named. Sockalexis, 
the first Native American to play major league baseball, played for Cleveland 
in 1897-99. When he died in 1913, the team was re-nicknamed the Indians, in 
tribute to Sockalexis. 
</P>
<P>
 For the record: Reader Rich Coberly correctly points out that Jim Thorpe drove 
in the winning 10th inning run with a single in the 1917 double no-hit game 
between the Chicago Cubs and Cincinnati Reds. 
</P>
<P>
 A Morning Briefing item in Friday's editions said he'd broken up the 
no-hitter, which was actually done by Larry Kopf.

STRIKE VICTIMS; IF THE BASEBALL PLAYERS GO ON STRIKE, THEY WON'T BE THE ONLY 
ONES NOT GETTING PAID; DODGER STADIUM'S 'REAL' WORKERS WILL FEEL PINCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 In his wood-paneled office, surrounded by framed pictures of his famous 
friends, Tom Lasorda stood midway between the Frank Sinatra wall and the Don 
Rickles wall, a few steps from Jilly's Corner. 
</P>
<P>
 It's obvious even in Pooh's Corner that a strike is bearing down on us like a 
high inside fastball. Lasorda said it's just as clear there is probably going 
to be enough hurt to go around. 
</P>
<P>
 There are people besides players who work at Dodger Stadium, such as food 
service and souvenir stand employees, ushers and parking lot attendants. 
</P>
<P>
 Lasorda said they will discover something about a strike they do not like: 
"They're going to be unemployed." 
</P>
<P>
 It was business as unusual Thursday, mainly because it might have been the 
Dodgers' last home game of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 After the game against the Padres, the Dodgers went on the road and don't get 
back until Friday, which is supposed to be the first day with no games. 
</P>
<P>
 For Marcia Natelborg, it would also be her first day without a job. 
</P>
<P>
 Natelborg, husband Bob and daughter Heather sell souvenirs in a booth on the 
box seat level down the first base line. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am looking for other jobs," she said. "Either that, or collect 
unemployment." 
</P>
<P>
 This is Bob Natelborg's 30th season selling souvenirs at Dodger Stadium. He 
began when he was 16. 
</P>
<P>
 A junior high teacher in San Marino, Natelborg works the baseball season at 
Dodger Stadium. He hopes the impending strike is no worse than the 1981 strike, 
when the Dodgers did not play 52 games, 26 of them at Dodger Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was a killer," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Marcia Natelborg said a strike by the players will prompt some serious 
reshuffling of family finances. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we're going to lose is what we save up for the winter months," she said. 
"We need it for tuition for school for our kids. We're really hurt. I don't 
know how we're going to make it up." 
</P>
<P>
 Workers at the concession stands were instructed by Dodger officials not to 
talk to reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 According to a Dodger spokesman, club policy requires that interview requests 
be channeled through the public relations department. 
</P>
<P>
 Outwardly, there didn't seem to be much different going on at the concession 
stands. 
</P>
<P>
 The air was filled with the familiar smell of popcorn and Dodger Dogs -- and 
the all too familiar smell of a season going up in smoke. 
</P>
<P>
 Lasorda said there are victims in any strike. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's what strikes do," Lasorda said. "When strikes occur, people become 
unemployed. That's the tough part about it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look at these little clubhouse kids. I feel bad for them. They're going to be 
unemployed and since they're not full-time employees, they won't be paid. 
</P>
<P>
 "All I know is that nobody wins in a strike. And it isn't the first time it's 
happened and it sure won't be the last." 
</P>
<P>
 Dave Dickinson is an attendant in the Dodger clubhouse. He works 80 hours a 
week when the Dodgers are at home and earns $5.15 an hour, plus occasional 
tips. 
</P>
<P>
 He might have worked his last game this season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know if they'll keep me or not," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pete Sandoval, who works alongside Dickinson, is in his 10th season with the 
Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have no idea what I'm going to do," he said. "I have a house payment and 
two kids, one on the way." 
</P>
<P>
 Many Dodger Stadium employees are like Mike McDermott, who has pitched batting 
practice at home games for 26 years. 
</P>
<P>
 McDermott and Tom Aloi, who also pitches batting practice, have regular jobs. 
McDermott works with the Los Angeles Unified School District, Aloi for Pacific 
Bell. 
</P>
<P>
 "I won't say I won't miss it," McDermott said. "The extra money is nice." 
</P>
<P>
 Sue Evans has sold souvenirs at Dodger Stadium since 1978, but she also works 
for Prudential Insurance in Woodland Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though she has another job, Evans said a baseball strike will be costly.  
</P>
<P>
 "There goes the bedroom furniture I won't buy," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The list of losers is a long one. The casualties will be many. For instance, 
if there aren't going to be any more games at Dodger Stadium this season, it 
also means an end to such special events and promotions as: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Dodger Family Game on Aug. 16. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Backpack Night on Aug. 18. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Trading Card Night on Aug. 21. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Fireworks Night on Sept. 3. 
</P>
<P>
 And, of course, a prolonged strike would wipe out the last scheduled promotion 
of the season, on Oct. 2 -- Fan Appreciation Day.

STRIKE VICTIMS; IF THE BASEBALL PLAYERS GO ON STRIKE, THEY WON'T BE THE ONLY 
ONES NOT GETTING PAID; THE HOTELS, BARS, AND RESTAURANTS WILL SUFFER TOO 
</P>

<P>
 A players strike would prove very costly to area businesses that depend on 
baseball games for revenue, owners of some of those establishments said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The strike (would have) a tremendous business impact," said Fred Ross, who 
owns Front Row Center ticket agency. "If you take away all the games nationally 
-- and consider what it will do to the communities -- it's going to cost 
hundreds of millions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whether it will cause a recession in the country . . . no, the country is 
bigger than baseball." 
</P>
<P>
 But Ross is correct, the devastation to baseball's peripheral businesses will 
be real if the strike begins on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Businesses such as ticket agencies, hotels and bars make a large part of their 
living off major league baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 Ross said the financial losses caused by a strike reach beyond the United 
States, but the main financial losses would occur here. 
</P>
<P>
 "The impact goes beyond our (ticket) business" he said. "Let me give you an 
example: If a Japanese business person comes to Los Angeles, just about the 
first thing he or she will do is find out what sporting events are happening. 
Baseball is huge there, so they want to see the Dodgers or the Angels. That's a 
lot of business right there. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then there's people in the United States, from places that don't have major 
league baseball, who want to vacation out here. Tourism may be down for a 
number of reasons, but people from Omaha or wherever always call to say, 'Hey, 
are the Dodgers in town?' There are people who may not come to L.A. because the 
Dodgers are not going to be here. So not only are they not going to be buying 
Dodger tickets, but they won't be here to go to restaurants or whatever." 
</P>
<P>
 As diverse as a ticket agency can be, Ross estimates baseball tickets make up 
5% of his overall business revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 He said that probably means he would have to lay off a full-time employee. Who 
can say if that job ever comes back? 
</P>
<P>
 "It has a direct impact from Dodger games alone," Ross said. "On the average, 
I sell about 40 tickets per game for $35. That's $1,400 for every game the 
Dodgers don't play." 
</P>
<P>
 Reduced patronage of restaurants and bars by Dodger and Angel fans would be 
particularly hard on the servers who rely on tips. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of employees are not going to be working a lot of hours that they would 
have," said Steve Nuccio, who owns Little Joe's -- a downtown haunt for Dodger 
fans. "A lot of my employees live off of tips. They aren't going to get them if 
people don't come because there are no games." 
</P>
<P>
 Nuccio estimates Little Joe's would lose about $1,000 per home game canceled 
because of the strike. That figures to about $20,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The Catch, a restaurant and bar across from Anaheim Stadium, projected a 
similar loss. 
</P>
<P>
 "We support the team, but the fans just are not coming out to see the team 
this year, so our numbers are down anyway," said John Marquez, food and 
beverage manager at The Catch. "The Rams will be here soon, and we do very well 
with them. Then we'll wait for the Ducks after that. Roller hockey has even 
helped. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it wasn't for the (Anaheim) Arena, the strike would have a devastating 
effect." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Marquez said The Catch already has had to cut back its staff because of 
low Angel attendance. 
</P>
<P>
 Marquez said even though it appears as if The Catch depends on Angels games, 
the bar can get by on regular business and business stemming from arena events. 
</P>
<P>
 "We learned over the years not to depend on sports events," Marquez said. 
"Even when stars like Ken Griffey Jr. come to town, the Angels are not drawing. 
</P>
<P>
 "The sports will often double our regular business, but the sports is a bonus, 
not our bread and butter." 
</P>
<P>
 Little Joe's doesn't have a nearby arena or other attractions to fall back on. 
</P>
<P>
 "I suppose we could have our own softball game and see who comes to watch," 
Nuccio said jokingly. 
</P>
<P>
 Another less-than-obvious loss of revenue would occur at hotels. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten American League teams stay at the Doubletree Hotel in Orange when they 
play the Angels. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll lose 900-some room-nights, plus food and beverage or whatever else the 
team might spend money on," said Mike Hall, who is general manager of the 
hotel. "We're looking at around $70,000 to $75,000 lost if the strike goes the 
whole season. 
</P>
<P>
 "That would have a big impact on us." 
</P>
<P>
 Also lost to hotels would be a small percentage of fans who travel to weekend 
games and stay overnight. 
</P>
<P>
 "We sell Dodger tickets in San Bernardino County all the time to people who 
drive into L.A. for a game, spend the night at a hotel, see a day game and then 
go home after that," Ross said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Others might stay in L.A. to shop or go to the movies. It affects the whole 
community." 
</P>
<P>
 Ross said that for every dollar spent on a game ticket, three to five more 
will be generated from it. 
</P>
<P>
 "You see it in what people pay for parking and concessions," Ross said. "It's 
the same if I go to the theater -- I spend it on parking, popcorn and 
whatever."  
</P>
<P>
 The strike would also have an impact on KTLA, which televises Angel and Dodger 
games. 
</P>
<P>
 Baseball has a reputation for being a poor ratings draw, but Greg Nathanson, 
general manager of KTLA, says that is deceiving. 
</P>
<P>
 "We would rather see baseball," Nathanson said. "Other shows will do as well, 
if not better, in terms of ratings. But baseball draws a different type of 
advertiser, so it is something we want. The advertising for baseball is at a 
premium rate." 
</P>
<P>
 The impact on television could last into next year. 
</P>
<P>
 "A strike will make us lose some momentum," Nathanson said. "The Dodger 
ratings are already up a point because this year they are in a pennant race. 
It's an exciting season with Ken Griffey, Frank Thomas, Jeff Bagwell all having 
great years. We're hopeful the ratings would increase and improve our 
advertising rate for next year."

GRAF STRUGGLES IN REACHING LA COSTA FINAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB WOLF, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Steffi Graf won again Saturday, advancing to the Toshiba Tennis Classic final, 
but the world's top-ranked woman continued to struggle. 
</P>
<P>
 Graf defeated No. 83 Tami Whitlinger-Jones of Henderson, Nev., 6-3, 6-4, in 
the tournament semifinals, but it was hardly convincing. No. 2 Arantxa Sanchez 
Vicario was far more impressive in defeating No. 3 Conchita Martinez in an 
all-Spanish semifinal, 6-4, 6-1. 
</P>
<P>
 Graf will be seeking her fourth championship in the $400,000 tournament at La 
Costa Resort & Spa, and her second in a row, when she meets Sanchez Vicario at 
11 a.m. today in a repeat of last year's final. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Graf holds a 23-6 edge over Sanchez Vicario, she will not be favored 
today. She has been in a slump since the French Open two months ago where she 
was routed by Mary Pierce in the semifinals. She also lost in the first round 
of Wimbledon to Lori McNeil last month. 
</P>
<P>
 Graf was a bit more satisfied with Saturday's performance than previous 
matches here. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if she was happier with her semifinal victory, she said, "Yes, I played 
better. I was surprised the way she (Whitlinger-Jones) played. She didn't make 
many mistakes. I was getting more into my shots." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Graf is not totally satisfied. 
</P>
<P>
 "I played some bad points, and I wasn't ready for all my shots," she said. "I 
didn't have complete concentration. Against Arantxa, I have to step into my 
forehand and go to the net more." 
</P>
<P>
 Graf has had trouble putting away overmatched opponents, and it was evident 
again Saturday when she hit rough spots after building leads of 5-1 and 5-2. 
Each time she lost two consecutive games before closing out the set. 
</P>
<P>
 Whitlinger-Jones, who had never reached the semifinals in five years on the 
tour, said, "It was frustrating to lose, but I'm happy with the way I played. 
This was a real test for me, and I finally feel like my game is coming 
together." 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez, the Wimbledon champion, who defeated Sanchez Vicario in last week's 
final in Stratton Mountain, Vt., was no match for her Barcelona rival this 
time. Her shots often lacked depth and authority, and Sanchez Vicario took full 
advantage. 
</P>
<P>
 "I made a lot of unforced errors, and I probably wasn't patient enough," 
Martinez said. "Arantxa doesn't make mistakes, and she hits deep and moves you 
around." 
</P>
<P>
 Sanchez Vicario attributed her victory to improvement in her serve-and-volley 
game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I went to the net a lot of times and put pressure on her," Sanchez Vicario 
said. "I volleyed much better, and whenever I got a ball at mid-court, I made 
the shot. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just think I was much better than her today." 
</P>
<P>
 That said, Sanchez Vicario looked ahead to today's showdown against Graf: 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll have to be at my best, but there is probably more chance to beat her now 
than there was in the past."

WIMBLEDON CHAMPION MARTINEZ ENTERS L.A. WOMEN'S TOURNAMENT

 After losing four of its top players, the Virginia Slims of Los Angeles got a 
boost Saturday when Wimbledon champion Conchita Martinez of Spain entered the 
tournament, which begins Monday at the Manhattan Country Club. 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez gives the event some much-needed depth after Kimiko Date, Lori 
McNeil, Gabriela Sabatini and Natalia Zvereva dropped out last week because of 
injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez, ranked third in the world, is the tournament's top-seeded player, 
followed by Martina Navratilova, Lindsay Davenport and Jana Novotna. 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez stopped Navratilova from winning her 10th singles title in a 
memorable three-set final at Wimbledon in July. She also reached the semifinals 
of the French Open before losing to eventual winner Arantxa Sanchez Vicario and 
the quarterfinals of the Australian Open where she lost to Date. 
</P>
<P>
 Qualifying matches will end today with the tournament starting at 9 a.m. 
Monday. The top eight seeded players drew first-round byes. ELLIOTT ALMOND

TOURNAMENT AT TURNING POINT; TENNIS: L.A. OPEN COPES WITH LEAN TIMES IN AN 
EFFORT TO CONTINUE ITS TRADITION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 They're serving grilled chicken Caesar salads and tennis balls at the Los 
Angeles Open, once the tournament of Tilden, Vines, Budge, Kramer, Laver, 
Gonzalez, Ashe, Connors and McEnroe. 
</P>
<P>
 It looked for a while like today's champion was going to be some guy who 
learned how to play tennis on a court made out of an ant bed. 
</P>
<P>
 Tennis is the great equalizer, all right, caring not one whit where you come 
from, only how often you can hit a line with a ball. 
</P>
<P>
 But Los Angeles tennis seems to be at a turning point. The men's event has no 
title sponsor to provide funding when Volvo ended a nine-year association and 
this week's women's tournament is expected to be the last Virginia Slims of Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 There are talks under way about combining the men's and women's events in 
back-to-back tournaments next year at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 Sponsor's dollars might be getting off the tennis court faster than, say, 
Boris Becker's first serve, but the L.A. Open is a fast learner on how to cope 
with a recession. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to be fine," said Jack Kramer of the tournament committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Tournament director Bob Kramer said the tournament could lose money. "We're 
fighting to break even and the tournament may come up short."  
</P>
<P>
 If so, it's not because Kramer didn't try most everything he could. When the 
ATP took control of the men's game in 1990, the tournament became a so-called 
World Series event, smaller than the Championship Series events that offer $1.7 
million in prize money. 
</P>
<P>
 Such a designation means that the tournament can offer appearance fees to 
attract star players. Although this was a common tennis practice in the past, 
it was not sanctioned and was done under the table. 
</P>
<P>
 For this tournament, four players -- Becker, Andre Agassi, Michael Chang and 
Richard Krajaicek -- signed incentive-based contracts that could have been 
worth about $600,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Becker's is the richest. If he defeats Mark Woodforde today to win the 
tournament, he can earn as much as $200,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Jason Stoltenberg, who first played tennis on the ant hill court in Australia, 
lost to Becker in Saturday night's semifinals. Stoltenberg ended Agassi's 
tournament in the quarterfinals. Agassi could have earned $150,000 by winning 
the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Kramer said the contracts with the players were based on Grand Slam event 
results and rankings in addition to how far each player advanced. 
</P>
<P>
 Each player receives a flat fee and additional money for reaching the 
semifinals, the final and for winning. 
</P>
<P>
 "The good thing about having contract players is that you have some control 
over what they do, like interviews or maybe some corporate hospitality or 
something," Kramer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kramer and Ivan Blumberg of ProServ, which has an association with the 
tournament, targeted Becker and Agassi more than a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's face it, Becker and Agassi are two people who fans will get out of 
their chairs at home to see play," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 All that was left was to draw up the contracts and see if Becker could claim 
his $200,000 or Agassi his $150,000. Prize money for winning the tournament is 
$42,000, or about one-fifth of Becker's appearance deal. 
</P>
<P>
 Jack Kramer said the idea of paying players $600,000 for the chance to win a 
$42,000 check strikes him as sort of cockeyed, but he understands. 
</P>
<P>
 "You've got to do something to get star players or the tournaments are going 
to die," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the old Los Angeles Tennis Club, where Tilden and Vines and the rest began 
the tournament's great tradition, Kramer remembered grand buffet lunches served 
on white linen tablecloths. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a different era," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The new one is well under way.

BASKETBALL / WORLD CHAMPIONSHIPS; KOMAZEC LEADS CROATIAN VICTORY

<TEXT>
<P>
 Arijan Komazec, who didn't play the first 13 minutes, scored 17 of his 25 
points in the second half, leading a rally that carried Croatia to an 83-69 
victory over Australia in the World Championship of Basketball on Saturday at 
Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
 Croatia won its third in a row to finish in first place in Pool B. Australia 
(2-1) also has a berth in the championship bracket. 
</P>
<P>
 Australia, which got 19 points from former Seton Hall star Andrew Gaze and 16 
from Mark Bradtke, led by as many as six points in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 Russia 73, Canada 66 -- Russia outscored Canada, 10-2, in the final 1:35 to 
win Pool C in a game at Hamilton. The teams were even throughout the second 
half until Russia (3-0) pulled away. 
</P>
<P>
 Cuba 92, South Korea 79 -- Angel Caballero scored 30 points on 11-for-12 
shooting in a Pool B game at Toronto. Caballero made all four of his 
three-point shots. 
</P>
<P>
 Argentina 67, Angola 59 -- Marcelo Nicola had 25 points and 11 rebounds at 
Hamilton to lead Argentina to third place in Pool C. Nicola's three-point play 
with nine minutes left brought Argentina (1-2) into a 50-50 tie. It took the 
lead for good 48 seconds later on a three-pointer by Juan Espil.

BASEBALL / DAILY REPORT; DODGERS; BULLPEN BEGINS TO EARN RESPECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARYANN HUDSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 No matter how well Dodger relievers do, it will take some time to erase their 
bad image. Having blown 20 of 39 saves, the relievers might never be able to 
undue the perception. The Dodgers' 19 saves are the fewest in the league. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Dodgers have won six of their last eight games, increasing their lead 
to four games over the San Francisco Giants, and the bullpen has played a large 
part. During the last seven-game home stand, relievers gave up only four runs 
in 20 1/3 innings. In the seven games, the bullpen was 2-1 with one save. 
</P>
<P>
 Todd Worrell has converted eight of his last 10 save opportunities after 
getting two in his first seven opportunities. He has given up no runs and three 
hits in his last five outings spanning six innings, during which he has pitched 
four perfect innings and converted both save opportunities.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard to explain, but it's a contagious thing, just like with hitting," 
said Mark Cresse, bullpen coach. "When the group as a whole is struggling it's 
like a snowball that keeps getting bigger. Worrell has been pitching well and 
Valdes, other than the times he was injured (blisters and sore back) has been 
solid and Roger (McDowell) got that big double play that helped us win the 
other day. But the key to the bullpen is Worrell." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Eric Karros, who opened his batting stance and hit well, then closed it and 
slumped somewhat, has opened his stance again. He is batting .311 with four 
home runs and 11 runs batted in his last 12 games. So why would he change it? 
"After a while you just gradually go back to your old habits, but Reggie 
(Smith) was working in the (batting) cage and wanted me to open up again so I 
changed," Karros said.  
</P>
<P>
 Smith said that sometimes hitters believe a change is temporary. "With Karros, 
opening up helps him accomplish the things he needs to do to see the ball and 
clear his hips out of the way." MARYANN HUDSON

BASEBALL / ROSS NEWHAN; BADLY CONCEIVED PENSION STUNT REVEALS TRUE COLORS OF 
OWNERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSS NEWHAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The pension-payment dispute was strictly symbolic. The players' union will 
eventually get its money. Nevertheless, it was an incredibly bad public 
relations gaffe by the owners during a bargaining situation in which the public 
is always ready to blame the high-salaried players, right or wrong. Now, as 
union director Don Fehr accurately said, "This should prove to everyone just 
who is pushing this fight." . . .  
</P>
<P>
 He has bolted past Cleveland's Manny Ramirez as the leading candidate for 
American League rookie of the year, but Bob Hamelin is more than that. He has 
filled the power void in the middle of the Kansas City Royals' lineup, what 
Manager Hal McRae calls the missing link of the last few years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to put any labels on a rookie," McRae said. "I don't want to say 
he's our big guy because we've got a lot of average guys who know how to play, 
but he's taken a lot of pressure off the middle of our lineup." 
</P>
<P>
 The Royals' designated hitter has been particularly influential in the 13-game 
winning streak his team took into a weekend series with the Seattle Mariners, 
clubbing six of his 23 home runs and collecting 13 of his 61 runs batted in. 
Back surgery slowed Hamelin's progress after he came out of UCLA as Kansas 
City's No. 2 draft pick in 1988, but he and his team seem to be on the same 
fast track now. Only the likelihood of a work stoppage mars their challenge of 
the Chicago White Sox, whom they beat four times in their streak, and the 
Indians in the AL Central, a wild-card threat at the least. 
</P>
<P>
 McRae said he's doing nothing more than taking one game at a time and, of 
course, has no control over a schedule that may end after a three-game series 
with the Angels that begins Monday night in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 "The confidence level here has never been higher," he said by phone. "We feel 
we can compete with anyone. If the season shuts down next week, we'll still be 
in decent shape. That's all we can do." That, and hope it resumes. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 If anyone understands what a work stoppage means to Matt Williams, Frank 
Thomas and Ken Griffey Jr. in their pursuit of sacred records, it's Mike 
Schmidt, the former Philadelphia Phillies third baseman who hit 31 homers with 
91 RBIs and 228 total bases in 1981 despite losing two months because of the 
midseason strike. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll always wonder what I could have accomplished," Schmidt said. "I was off 
to the best start of anybody in the National League at the time, but you can't 
lose sight of your livelihood. Players have to remember that a guy can make $7 
million now because guys supported the union then. It's something I had to deal 
with, something they have to deal with. It's a fact of life for the 
players..".. 
</P>
<P>
 Interesting. Phillies CEO Bill Giles acknowledged that the owners have 
consistently lied to the players, but not this time, of course. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know we've cried about this for a hundred years," Giles said of the 
economic problems. "There's no question the owners are partly to blame. 
Collusion was wrong, and we've basically been as wrong as the players. We've 
said we wanted to change the system in the past, but we've never been as 
serious as we are now." 
</P>
<P>
 Trust em? "Sounds like the same bull . . . to me," Phillie player rep Darren 
Daulton said. "They keep saying they want to work together, want to be 
partners, then they pull what they pulled this week (with the pension payment), 
and you think about the three collusion cases, and you have to say, 'What makes 
this different?' You have to say, 'If we didn't believe them before, why now?' 
" . . . FINAL PITCH 
</P>
<P>
 They may not be the last of the good guys, but they're among them. Charlie 
Hough, 46, retired a week ago. Now a myriad of shoulder problems, including a 
badly torn rotator cuff, has forced Rick Sutcliffe, 38, to think about it. "I 
just don't know yet," the St. Louis Cardinals veteran said. "I'm pretty 
stubborn. I won the comeback-player-of-the-year award three times. They said 
nobody else had even won it twice. But the way it sounds, I may need surgery 
just to go fishing. I've been praying the last few days, looking for an answer. 
I keep getting one, but it's not the one I want to hear. Hopefully, the good 
Lord will change his mind." . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The Cardinals lost 17 of their first 22 games after the All-Star break and 
dropped 12 games under .500 for the first time since 1990. An 8-20 July was 
their worst in 24 years. "We're just not very good," Ozzie Smith said. "It's 
probably time for a major overhaul. As major as you can make it." 
</P>
<P>
 A major overhaul would probably not include the 39-year-old Smith. His 400th 
plate appearance of the season Tuesday automatically rolled over his contract 
at $3 million for next year. He'll be back for his final season even if he may 
have wanted to go out elsewhere. "There's no justice, is there?" he said with a 
laugh. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The Atlanta Braves have finished the last three years with three different 
closers -- Alejandro Pena, Jeff Reardon and Greg McMichael -- but the imminent 
work stoppage has thwarted trade aspirations and forced the Braves to consider 
breaking up their vaunted rotation by moving John Smoltz into that role.

 As the Braves begin to lose sight of the Montreal Expos in the National League 
East, the bullpen has converted just 24 of 37 save chances, and McMichael has 
blown nine. Smoltz, meanwhile, had an 0-3 July, is 6-10 as the only Atlanta 
starter with a losing record and is 50-46 since 1991, not that impressive 
considering the Braves are 125 games over .500 in that span. 
</P>
<P>
 Moving Smoltz would allow Kent Mercker (9-3, 3.42 ERA) to retain a regular 
starting spot. "I'll do anything the organization wants," Smoltz said. "I 
believe in the manager (Bobby Cox). He has believed in me maybe more than I 
believed in myself in certain situations." . . . HURTING . . .  
</P>
<P>
 It appears that the Oakland Athletics have finally experienced too many 
injuries to sustain their valiant comeback in the wretched AL West. Their best 
hitters -- Brent Gates, Mark McGwire and Geronimo Berroa -- have each gone on 
the disabled list since July 17. Oakland has made 14 DL moves this year and 
currently has eight players on the list. The only regulars who have not gone 
down are Terry Steinbach, Ruben Sierra, Mike Bordick and Stan Javier. The 
ultimate barometer is McGwire, battling heel injuries for a second straight 
season. The A's, through Thursday, were 24-23 with him, 23-37 without him. . . 
.  
</P>
<P>
 Then there's Rickey Henderson, who has stuck the hometown team with that 
two-year contract through 1995. Henderson has been on and off the DL, in and 
out of the A's lineup. Now he has apparently given up on another season. Why 
not? He has already compiled five home runs, 19 RBIs and 18 stolen bases. Since 
July 31 of last year, when traded to Toronto, he has nine homers, 35 RBIs and a 
.236 average in 135 games, including that 8 for 47 in the postseason. . . . 
Among the recent labor comments of White Sox owner Jerry Reinsdorf: "Something 
positive can happen if Don Fehr wants it to happen. Or maybe if Marvin (Miller) 
wants it to. I'm not sure who makes the decisions over there." What gall. Who 
in the world has made the ownership decisions that have contributed to seven 
work stoppages in 22 years: The commissioners? The ever changing chief 
negotiators? The owners amid their self-interest whims? 
</P>
<P>
 Who was making the decisions this time when it took 18 months for the big 
markets and small markets to agree to a revenue-sharing formula so that a 
salary-cap proposal could finally be made to the union? It's been consensus by 
committee under interim commissioner Bud Selig, and while Miller's ghost still 
hovers over a union that is reluctant to give back, decision making is a lot 
clearer, simpler and faster than with the often splintered owners. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Haywood Sullivan, who sold his interest in the Boston Red Sox to co-owner John 
Harrington for $36 million in November, would like to buy in with another 
franchise, but he will have trouble getting approval now after saying he is 
opposed to revenue sharing and that a salary cap "is just a substitute for 
people who can't handle their business, for people who have trouble running 
their business." Sullivan predicts there will be ownership opportunities, as 
there were after the last work stoppage in 1990. "There were a lot of changes 
then, and there will be more this time," he said. . . . WHAT PRESSURE 
</P>
<P>
 Matt Williams, the San Francisco Giants' Gold Glove third baseman, has made 
seven errors since the All-Star break and five in the last nine games through 
Thursday. Asked before Wednesday's game with the Cincinnati Reds if the pursuit 
of Babe Ruth and Roger Maris had affected his defensive play, the normally 
impassive Williams knocked over a cart filled with laundry, pounded a wall with 
his fist and stormed through the clubhouse yelling an obscenity. "Probably 
reacted in a way I shouldn't have," he said later. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 That was Kevin Mitchell of the Reds lounging in the Giant clubhouse this week, 
chatting with former teammates in what has been a yearlong campaign to 
re-ingratiate himself -- the two people, Al Rosen and Will Clark, who most 
wanted Mitchell out are both gone -- and re-interest the Giants in his 
availability as a free agent. Mitchell said the Giants have "an awesome lineup 
that could be awesomer next year." On Barry Bonds, Williams and Darryl 
Strawberry in the middle, he said: "They're dangerous and they know they're 
dangerous. Might as well give 'em a machine gun and send 'em to Ruwaiti." 
Ruwaiti? Mitchell's atlas places it somewhere between Rwanda, Kuwait and Haiti 
. . .  
</P>
<P>
 The Reds outscored the Giants, 30-14, to register their first three-game sweep 
at Candlestick Park since 1975 and finish off a 6-1 trip that gave them 
breathing room in the NL Central. Nevertheless, Red Manager Davey Johnson 
shared Mitchell's impression of the Giant lineup and said of Strawberry, his 
former New York Mets outfielder: "I knew how to pitch him when he was up all 
night. I don't know now." . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Deion Sanders dismisses rumors that he'll return to the Atlanta Falcons during 
a baseball strike. "I'm too important to this team to risk injury, so I won't 
take that risk," the Reds' leadoff hitter said. Prime Time was 13 for his last 
67 through Thursday with one RBI.

 -- Frightening: Kevin Seitzer of the Milwaukee Brewers suffered a multiple 
fracture of his left sinus cavity when hit by Melido Perez's fastball in a 
Monday night game with the New York Yankees, but returned to the lineup 
Tuesday. The pitch caught part of Seitzer's ear flap, and he was able to joke 
about it later. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I went down, I said, 'I'm going to open my eyes and see if I'm in heaven 
or Milwaukee.' " he said. "They can't be mistaken for each other." 
</P>
<P>
 -- No Surprise: Only two players selected in the first round of the June draft 
have yet to sign. Both are advised by Scott Boras, no favorite of the 28 clubs. 
The players are Georgia Tech catcher Jason Varitek, picked 14th by the Seattle 
Mariners, and Mississippi State pitcher Carlton Loewer, chosen 23rd by the 
Philadelphia Phillies, who have reportedly withdrawn their $570,000 final 
offer. Varitek, who returned to school for his senior year after having been 
drafted in the first round a year ago by the Minnesota Twins, is without 
substantive options. The Mariners have reportedly offered $425,000. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Control Specialist: A work stoppage may interrupt several record pursuits, 
but it may enable Bret Saberhagen of the New York Mets to claim one. Saberhagen 
had 12 victories and 12 walks through Thursday. The last pitcher to have more 
victories than walks in a season was Slim Sallee of the Cincinnati Reds in 
1919. Sallee won 21 games and walked only 20 in 227 innings. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Good News/Bad News: The Cleveland Indians' offense had compiled 10 or more 
hits in 59 games through Thursday, helping produce a 41-18 record in those 
games, but the bullpen had lost six games in which the team led after eight 
innings, and nine in which it led after seven.

BASEBALL / DAILY REPORT; ANGELS; CLUB HAS BEGUN PULLING UP STAKES 
</P>

<P>
 The Angels have already begun pulling scouts off the road. Employees have been 
told to start taking paid vacations to avoid layoffs.Coaches have been told to 
go home. 
</P>
<P>
 The looming Aug. 12 strike has cast a pall over the organization, which is 
projecting to lose as much as $6 million, but perhaps nothing is more 
frustrating than the damage it has already created. 
</P>
<P>
 If not for the inevitability of a work stoppage, the Angels say they would 
have already made several moves, including acquiring a closer, that might have 
enabled them to contend for the American League West. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the part that's so frustrating," Angel President Richard Brown said. 
"The way it looks, nobody wants to win the division. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we had made a couple of moves, the ones we wanted to make, we could have 
been right back in the race, but the strike really stopped it." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Andrew Lorraine probably made his last start Saturday for the Angels, at least 
until mid-September. He is expected to be sent back to triple-A Vancouver this 
week because of the pending strike. The Angels want him to continue pitching so 
that he remains a candidate for the rotation in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Why does the Major League Players Assn. believe owners will feel the pain of 
their Aug. 12 strike, which is almost certain to wipe out two weekends of play? 
</P>
<P>
 A year ago at this time, major league baseball drew an average of 35,830 on 
the Aug. 12 weekend, and an average of 37,433 on the Aug. 19 weekend, for a 
total of 3.002 million fans spanning 82 dates. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chicago White Sox, who start a seven-game home stand beginning Aug. 12, 
had already sold 250,000 tickets for the first week of games, worth about $2.5 
million. BOB NIGHTENGALE

WHITE SOX WIN MARATHON AGAINST ANGELS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB NIGHTENGALE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There are privileges that go with being a major league player, benefits that 
aren't available to others. 
</P>
<P>
 Rarely do you have to pay for a round of golf. Never do you have to buy your 
own tennis shoes. And you can earn a few thousand dollars by attending a 
baseball card show. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago White Sox right fielder Darrin Jackson plans to utilize his status for 
a different purpose. 
</P>
<P>
 He seeks justice. 
</P>
<P>
 "The pain is still there," Jackson said Saturday before the marathon 
Angel-White Sox game, which Chicago won in 10 innings, 16-10, after midnight. 
"And I'm not about to let it go." 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson's nephew, Jaime Apolonia Moreno, was murdered June 12 in Los Angeles 
at his sister-in-law's home. Jackson, who doubled and scored the winning run on 
Saturday, said the family knows who committed the stabbing. There were 
witnesses, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, the investigation has only recently commenced and no charges have been 
filed. Yvonne Brathwaite Burke of the Board of Supervisors of the Second 
District said she has been apprised of the case, and the Los Angeles District 
Attorney's office and homicide detectives are investigating. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want this case to be treated as just another minority killing in 
South Central," said Jackson, born and raised in Los Angeles. "That's why I'm 
keeping on them. I don't want this case to just die. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was a beautiful man we're talking about, and I'm not going to just sit 
here and let the D.A.'s office dismiss this thing. And I'm afraid that if our 
family wasn't constantly keeping on them, it would be. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm telling you if there's a strike, you'll be seeing me and (his wife) 
Darlene on the courthouse steps, demanding some action. We're not going away." 
</P>
<P>
 On the field, Jackson continues to use his clout in the White Sox's bid for a 
second consecutive division championship. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, the Angels hit five home runs in the first seven innings -- two 
apiece by J.T. Snow and Tim Salmon, and one by Chili Davis -- before 35,589 at 
Anaheim Stadium. While the White Sox's pitching was miserable, the Angels 
showed they can be just as bad, surrendering 17 hits and a team-record tying 13 
walks. 
</P>
<P>
 The White Sox were one out away from winning in the ninth, leading, 10-9. But 
Bo Jackson's grounder was thrown away by Robin Ventura, and pinch-runner Harold 
Reynolds scored from second when Greg Myers followed with a single to center. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 10th, Darrin Jackson led off with a double, moved to third on a 
groundout by Lance Johnson and scored on Joey Cora's single. 
</P>
<P>
 Ozzie Guillen tripled to left off Mark Leiter (4-6), scoring Cora. Mike 
LaValliere followed with a single to right to score Guillen. 
</P>
<P>
 Angel reliever Jeff Schwarz typified the pitching problems, walking two 
batters with the bases loaded without throwing a strike in the fifth inning. He 
wound up throwing 22 pitches, 18 balls, and walked four batters in two-thirds 
of an inning. 
</P>
<P>
 But he was nearly upstaged by White Sox reliever Scott Sanderson in the 
seventh. He threw only 10 pitches, but still managed to yield back-to-back home 
runs by Davis and Salmon. 
</P>
<P>
 It hardly was amusing to the White Sox, who need all of the help they can get 
to stay atop the American League Central until the Aug. 12 strike date. They 
lead the Cleveland Indians by a half game, and the Kansas City Royals by two 
games. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are the most important games of the whole season," said pitcher Wilson 
Alvarez. "There's a lot of pressure on us, there's a lot of pressure on 
everybody." 
</P>
<P>
 Then again. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no pressure on us," said Snow, who snapped his zero-for-21 skid 
against the White Sox. "We get to the play the role of spoilers. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not the same as being in it, but it's the next-best thing."

AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP; MARINERS END ROYALS' 14-GAME WINNING STREAK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Kansas City Royals' 14-game winning streak ended Saturday night as Reggie 
Jefferson drove in four runs and Edgar Martinez hit a three-run homer to lead 
the Seattle Mariners to an 11-2 rout at Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
 The Royals' first loss since June 22 ended baseball's longest winning streak 
since the Minnesota Twins won 15 in a row in 1991. Kansas City began its run 
trailing by 9 1/2 games in the American League Central, but sweeps of Chicago, 
Minnesota and Oakland helped the Royals move back into the playoff race. 
</P>
<P>
 Jefferson hit three doubles for the Mariners, who were playing their 15th game 
on the road since the Kingdome was closed for structural repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mariners handed rookie Tim Davis (2-2) a 9-0 lead after four innings. 
Davis gave up seven hits and two runs in five innings. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Gubicza (7-9), who was 12-4 against the Mariners, gave up 11 hits and 
seven runs in only three innings. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Royals had a real nice run," Mariner Manager Lou Piniella said. "It was a 
great run. But tonight was just our night." 
</P>
<P>
 Baltimore 5, Milwaukee 0 -- Arthur Rhodes pitched his second consecutive 
shutout at Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
 Rhodes (3-5), who pitched the second shutout of his career Monday after being 
called up from triple-A Rochester, struck out three, walked five and gave up 
five hits in his third complete game. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orioles, who had not had a shutout this season before Rhodes' outing on 
Monday against the Twins, have four shutouts in six games. 
</P>
<P>
 Baltimore's Mark McLemore went two for four and drove in three runs. 
</P>
<P>
 Minnesota 10, New York 4 -- Kirby Puckett reached 100 runs batted in faster 
than any other Twin player ever at Minneapolis, helping the Twins end the 
Yankees' eight-game winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
 Puckett, Kent Hrbek, Shane Mack and Pedro Munoz homered for the Twins. Paul 
O'Neill connected for the Yankees, who had won 10 in a row on the road. 
</P>
<P>
 Puckett drove in three runs, giving him 101 RBIs. He reached 100 RBIs for the 
third time in his career, and did it this season in his 104th game. Harmon 
Killebrew accomplished the feat in 106 games in 1969, the previous fastest in 
team history. 
</P>
<P>
 Puckett had a solo homer, his 18th, and a two-run double in support of Pat 
Mahomes (9-5). 
</P>
<P>
 Boston 8-0, Cleveland 4-7 -- Dennis Martinez pitched a two-hitter and Carlos 
Baerga homered twice as the Indians earned a split at Boston. 
</P>
<P>
 John Valentin was five for five and drove in five runs for the Red Sox in the 
opener. 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez (11-6), who has won 10 of his last 12 decisions, gave up a leadoff 
single by Otis Nixon in the first and a two-out single by Tim Naehring in the 
second. After Naehring's hit, he retired 19 in a row before walking Wes 
Chamberlain to open the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
 Oakland 6, Texas 4 -- Terry Steinbach's triple scored the go-ahead run and 
highlighted a five-run eighth inning as the Athletics rallied to win at home. 
</P>
<P>
 Steinbach, who also drove in the winning run in a 5-4 victory Friday night, 
hit a two-run triple off reliever Tom Henke (3-5). 
</P>
<P>
 Detroit 3, Toronto 2 -- Cecil Fielder and Tony Phillips homered at Toronto to 
help the Tigers end a three-game losing streak.

NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP; BAGWELL HITS 39TH, ASTROS HANG ON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jeff Bagwell hit his 39th home run Saturday night to help the Houston Astros 
defeat the San Francisco Giants, 8-7, at Houston. 
</P>
<P>
 Matt Williams hit his major league-leading 42nd home run for the Giants, who 
have lost five in a row to fall four games behind the division-leading Dodgers 
in the National League West. 
</P>
<P>
 The Astros, who have won five in a row, took an 8-4 lead into the ninth, but 
Jeff Reed hit a three-run homer against John Hudek with none out. 
</P>
<P>
 With one out, pinch-runner Mike Benjamin was thrown out by center fielder 
Steve Finley when he tried to go from first to third on Todd Benzinger's 
single. Barry Bonds popped up to end the game. 
</P>
<P>
 A day after setting Astro single-season records for homers, runs batted in and 
extra-base hits, Bagwell struck again. His home run in the third inning gave 
him a major league-leading 115 RBIs and increased his career-best hitting 
streak to 16 games. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's Jeff Bagwell's year," Astro Manager Terry Collins said. "He has done 
everything he has to do to show that he's the MVP." 
</P>
<P>
 Atlanta 2, Cincinnati 1 -- Greg Maddux of the Braves gave up only three hits 
in eight innings at Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
 The Reds hit only two balls out of the infield against Maddux (15-6), none 
after the second inning. Deion Sanders had a soft single and Eddie Taubensee 
and Reggie Sanders reached on weak infield singles. 
</P>
<P>
 Maddux lowered his major league-leading earned-run average to 1.63. The 
two-time Cy Young Award winner led the NL with a 2.36 ERA last year. 
</P>
<P>
 David Justice his his 17th homer and Terry Pendleton had a run-scoring single 
for the Braves. 
</P>
<P>
 Montreal 4, Philadelphia 3 -- Wil Cordero scored the winning run from third 
base on a slow grounder to the mound in the 11th inning at Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
 John Kruk's two-run homer in the ninth pulled the Phillies even, but it didn't 
prevent the Expos' seventh victory in eight games. The Expos have won 17 of 19. 
</P>
<P>
 Cordero opened the 11th by hitting a high bouncer to reliever Doug Jones, who 
threw wildly past first for a two-base error. 
</P>
<P>
 After Lenny Webster sacrificed, pinch-hitter Lou Frazier hit a slow, 
two-hopper to Jones. Cordero broke for the plate and slid home ahead of Jones' 
throw. 
</P>
<P>
 Florida 4, New York 3 -- Jeff Conine had a three-run double in a four-run 
fifth inning for the Marlins at New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Pat Rapp (7-7), who had lost his previous two decisions, lasted only five 
innings but got the victory. He gave up two runs on five hits while striking 
out six and walking three. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago 7, San Diego 1 -- Frank Castillo pitched a six-hitter for the Cubs at 
Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 Castillo (2-1) was within one out of his first major league shutout but gave 
up three consecutive singles. He won his second consecutive start since being 
called up from triple-A Iowa on July 30. He walked one and struck out a 
season-high seven. 
</P>
<P>
 Rick Wilkins went three for four with a homer for the Cubs, who ended a 
four-game losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
 St. Louis 6, Pittsburgh 3 -- Luis Alicea's three-run double capped a four-run 
eighth inning for the Cardinals at Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cardinals have won three in a row since losing 10 of 11. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pirates stranded eight runners in the first six innings and trailed, 2-1, 
before homers by Orlando Merced and Dave Clark on consecutive pitches by Omar 
Olivares gave them a 3-2 lead in the seventh.

MATURITY HELPS THOMAS BALANCE HIS GOALS, OBLIGATIONS; BASEBALL: DESPITE HAVING 
AN OUTSTANDING SEASON ON OFFENSE, THE CHICAGO STAR WILL WALK WITH HIS TEAMMATES 
IF NO CONTRACT SETTLEMENT IS REACHED.

 The Big Hurt has spoken. The question is whether you want to continue pointing 
out the potential damage of a protracted strike to Frank Thomas' incredible 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 You would think the only strike Thomas wants to see is a belt-high fastball. 
</P>
<P>
 You also would think Thomas would want to keep hearing the roar of the fans, 
including a youngster who called out to him before Saturday's game, "Mr. Hurt, 
Mr. Hurt." 
</P>
<P>
 But Thomas isn't about to go on the record as saying he would rather break 
ranks and keep playing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some things are more important," said Thomas, who hit his American 
League-leading 38th home run Saturday against the Angels. "I've had a good 
season so far. I might do it again next season. That's the challenge." 
</P>
<P>
 Solidarity. Power to the players. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas holds firm to the union line, no matter the consequences. And rest 
assured they are considerable. Just look at his statistics. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas, who plays first for the Chicago White Sox, began Saturday's game, tied 
or leading the league in batting average, home runs, runs, walks, on-base 
percentage and slugging percentage. He was fourth in runs batted in. 
</P>
<P>
 A strike of any significant length will stamp an asterisk on Thomas' stats in 
his run for the Triple Crown. The possibility of a strike hangs like a dark 
cloud, growing uglier as Friday's strike date approaches. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really too bad," Chicago Manager Gene Lamont said. "It would be one 
thing if they were cheap numbers. But he's got decent numbers (even if the 
season ends Friday). The games are important, but individual accomplishments 
are important, too. The fans are always interested in that." 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas knows the Triple Crown, Roger Maris' record of 61 home runs, the 
playoffs and World Series could be in jeopardy. It's not a pleasant thought, 
but neither is the prospect of a salary cap. 
</P>
<P>
 "I achieved the MVP last year, and that was a big personal goal," said Thomas, 
batting .359 with 37 homers, 97 RBIs, 104 runs scored and 106 walks before 
Saturday. "So what if I'm having a career year. No one or two players are 
bigger than this game. The union is strong and we (the players) have to stay 
together." 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, but the Triple Crown, Frank? 
</P>
<P>
 "Stats are very important," he said. "The Triple Crown is something very 
unusual. But you don't want to think about that too much. It affects your 
play." 
</P>
<P>
 Even after only 108 games, Thomas' stats aren't all that far off those of Carl 
Yastrzemski, the last player to win the Triple Crown when he batted .326 with 
44 homers and 121 RBIs in 1967. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps that's what pains Lamont most when he thinks about the possibility of 
a strike. Statistics this season are so amazing, who knows if Thomas, Ken 
Griffey Jr., Jeff Bagwell, Tony Gwynn and Matt Williams will ever accomplish 
what they have so far again in the same year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know why the numbers are so big, but you're talking about 150 RBIs to 
win the thing this year," Lamont said. "The home runs have kind of slowed down. 
They were talking about 60 home runs, but I don't know now. It's too bad. What 
if the numbers went down next year and nobody challenged (those records) again. 
Will that happen? I don't know. I don't know why the numbers jumped up so much 
this year." 
</P>
<P>
 In Thomas' case, it might have something to do with patience and maturity. He 
said those factors have allowed him to become a more selective hitter. 
</P>
<P>
 It also doesn't hurt the Big Hurt that Julio Franco, hitting .316 with 14 
homers and 92 RBIs, bats behind him. There's no sense pitching around Thomas to 
get to Franco, although New York Yankee Manager Buck Showalter has said he 
might consider walking Thomas with the bases loaded. 
</P>
<P>
 "Walks set up hits," Thomas explained. "Average is important to me. It's 
something I'd like to lead the league in. It's something I shouldn't be leading 
the league in. Guys my size (6 feet 5, 257 pounds) should be hitting more home 
runs than anybody else. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every at-bat is important now. We're all hoping the strike gets settled. You 
don't want it to take away from a great season." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed.

NFL EXHIBITION ROUNDUP; MARINO RETURNS WITH A SPLASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dan Marino, playing for the first time since tearing his Achilles' tendon last 
October, threw a 78-yard touchdown pass for the game's first score Saturday 
night to help the Miami Dolphins beat the Pittsburgh Steelers, 24-14, in Miami. 
</P>
<P>
 Marino was in for 14 plays for Miami (2-0). Despite rainy weather, he 
completed three of five passes for 99 yards, including the touchdown to Mike 
Williams. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was pretty sweet after being out for so long," Marino said. "I still 
don't have the confidence I need, but I threw it OK." 
</P>
<P>
 First-round draft choice Charles Johnson stood out in his pro debut for 
Pittsburgh (0-1). He gained 77 yards on four receptions, including a 30-yard 
touchdown catch. 
</P>
<P>
 Denver 37, Atlanta 16 -- Former UCLA standout Tommy Maddox threw two touchdown 
passes, directing the Broncos (1-1) to scores on three of the six series he 
worked, in a victory over the Falcons (1-1) in Denver. 
</P>
<P>
 The 37 points were the most by a Denver team in an exhibition game in six 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 Maddox, replacing starter John Elway late in the first quarter, completed 18 
of 28 passes for 291 yards. Fourteen of his completions accounted for first 
downs. 
</P>
<P>
 Tampa Bay 17, Cincinnati 16 -- It was a situation ripe for Coach Sam Wyche's 
trickery. 
</P>
<P>
 With quarterback Casey Weldon lined up at wide receiver, single back Vince 
Workman took a snap direct from center and ran up the middle for a two-point 
conversion that gave the Buccaneers (1-0) a victory over the Bengals (0-1) in 
Tampa, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 Weldon (13 for 19 for 146 yards) led each of Tampa Bay's four scoring drives 
in a bid to win the No. 3 quarterback job behind Craig Erickson (nine for 11 
for 95 yards) and first-round draft pick Trent Dilfer, who signed last 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Dilfer did not play. 
</P>
<P>
 Houston 31, San Diego 3 -- Reserve quarterback Bucky Richardson led Houston to 
19 second quarter points, 16 after four turnovers by San Diego, leading the 
Oilers (1-1) to a rout of the Chargers (0-2) in San Antonio. 
</P>
<P>
 Oiler starter Cody Carlson played a crisp two series, hitting four-of-five 
passes for 45 yards. Richardson played the second quarter and completed 
seven-of-15 passes for 117 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Cleveland 24, New York 15 -- Vinny Testaverde threw a 24-yard touchdown pass 
late in the first half to give the Browns the lead en route to opening their 
schedule with a victory over the Giants (0-2) in East Rutherford, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
 Ex-Washington quarterback Mark Rypien (five for 11 for 83 yards) replaced 
Testaverde (13 for 28 for 162 yards) in the fourth quarter and led the Browns 
to two scores, Matt Stover's 45- and 21-yard field goals. 
</P>
<P>
 Giants starter Kent Graham was 12 for 23 for 122 yards and threw an 
interception in struggling for the second consecutive game. Dave Brown, edging 
ahead in the battle to replace Phil Simms, was nine for 15 for 88 yards and an 
interception on the last play. 
</P>
<P>
 Minnesota 17, Kansas City 9 -- Terry Allen, who missed last season with a knee 
injury, and Amp Lee rushed for first half touchdowns as the Vikings (1-1) won 
over the Chiefs (0-2) in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Montana started and played sparingly for the Chiefs, misfiring on all four 
of his pass attempts.

GOLF ROUNDUP; PAVIN LEADS BY FOUR, BUT AZINGER STEALS THE SHOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Corey Pavin, seeking his second tour victory this season, shot a seven-under 
65 to take a four-shot lead over first-round leader Fred Funk in the Buick Open 
in Grand Blanc, Mich., on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, for the second day in a row, Pavin wasn't even the most popular player 
in his threesome. 
</P>
<P>
 That honor went to Paul Azinger, playing in his first tournament since being 
diagnosed as having cancer last November. 
</P>
<P>
 Azinger continued his return with a 70 for a total of 146. He missed the cut, 
but it was clear Azinger's game was coming back after a nine-month battle with 
illness. 
</P>
<P>
 And barely in time. Azinger will defend his PGA Championship title starting 
Thursday at Tulsa, Okla. 
</P>
<P>
 Azinger, followed hole to hole by an army of cheering fans, had consecutive 
birdies at Nos. 7, 8 and 9 to turn at two-under 34. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a good feeling to whip a few in there," Azinger said. "I could have 
had four birdies in a row, but I just couldn't putt." 
</P>
<P>
 Pavin was at 131. Funk shot a 70 for 135. Davis Love III was at 136 after 
rounds of 69 and 67, tied with Duffy Waldorf, who also shot 67 in the second 
round. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Carolyn Hill, whose best finish was a second place 13 years ago, shot a 
career-best 65 to take a two-shot lead at 206 in the McCall's LPGA Classic at 
Stratton Mountain, Vt. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill's 10-under-par 206 put her in front entering a final round for the first 
time since 1981. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a great feeling. I'm very excited," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nancy Ramsbottom, one shot out of the lead starting the day, fell another 
stroke back but retained second place with a two-under 70 for 208. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Albus shot a six-under 66 to take a three-stroke lead at 133 in the 
$750,000 Bank of Boston Senior PGA Classic at Concord, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
 Albus withstood the challenges of Raymond Floyd and Lee Trevino in building 
his lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Floyd shot a 67 and was at 136. Trevino also fired a 67 for a 137. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Darren Clarke of Northern Ireland had a four-under 68 to take a two-stroke 
lead at 204 in the BMW International Open at Munich.

NETTING NEW EXPERIENCES IN EUROPE; WEST VALLEY GIRLS' SOCCER TEAM WINS GAMES, 
FRIENDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF WONG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The West Valley Fusion girls' soccer team returned from its trip to Germany 
and Denmark last week a little weary, but more cultured than when it left home. 
</P>
<P>
 The girls arrived in California Tuesday night after a hectic schedule that 
included 14 matches in 19 days, but they did have enough strength left to carry 
home two trophies. Competing in the 14-and-under division, the girls finished 
first and third in two international tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
 Although it was billed as much a cultural exchange as it was a soccer tour, 
soccer clearly defined West Valley's presence there. The Fusion dominated its 
foreign opponents, losing only twice to Danish club teams. 
</P>
<P>
 West Valley finished first in a 16-team field at the Vildbjerg Cup, an annual 
international tournament sponsored by a local sports club and a Danish brewery. 
</P>
<P>
 One week later, the Fusion finished third in a 31-team field at the Dana Cup 
in Hjorring, a village in northern Denmark. The international tournament, which 
drew more than 5,000 players, was sponsored by another Danish club. 
</P>
<P>
 West Valley apparently impressed teams everywhere it played. Friends were 
made, even with players on the teams it beat. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of teams we played tagged along with us," goalkeeper Kelly Chever said. 
"There was one team we beat, 12-0, that just stuck around and went everywhere 
we went. If I got beat 12-0, I wouldn't want to talk about it." 
</P>
<P>
 When not on the soccer field practicing or playing, the girls experienced 
everyday life in Germany and Denmark while staying with host families in small 
villages. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was strange at first because the people were really different than us," 
midfielder Jessica Armcross said. "They were really open and we were really 
shy, but after a while everybody got along fine." 
</P>
<P>
 West Valley Coach David Cummins proposed the trip after a number of West 
Valley families had served as hosts to soccer players from other countries for 
area tournaments. The team then launched an 18-month fund-raising drive. 
</P>
<P>
 The team left home July 14 and spent six days in Wohnste, a small village in 
Germany. West Valley beat the village's club team, MTV Wohnste, 4-2, before 
moving on to Vildbjerg, a village in central Denmark. 
</P>
<P>
 "We stayed in a farm town," fullback Erin Kelly said. "Every day you go next 
door to your neighbor to milk a cow for breakfast. It's different."

REST OF SAUGUS FIELD UNABLE TO PUT DENT IN WOODSIDE'S SPORTSMAN LEAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RON STAPP, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sean Woodside did not have the look of a champion on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Thanks to an accident in a trophy dash earlier in the night, the right side of 
Woodside's car was severely damaged -- at least cosmetically. 
</P>
<P>
 But looks can be deceiving as Woodside inched closer to the Sportsman points 
championship with a victory and a second-place finish in the twin 25-lap main 
events at Saugus Speedway. 
</P>
<P>
 The Saugus resident, who entered the night with a 34-point lead over Ron 
Daniels of San Bernardino, finished with just that -- a 34-point advantage -- 
with only three races left this season. 
</P>
<P>
 In the opening 25-lap event, Woodside and Sean Monroe of Los Angeles exchanged 
the lead -- and contact -- before Monroe was forced to the pits with a flat 
tire on the eighth lap. 
</P>
<P>
 Woodside then out-dueled Daniels, who finished second, to register his fifth 
main-event victory of the season. Craig Rayburn of Simi Valley was third, 
followed by Carson's Gary Sigman. 
</P>
<P>
 Sigman led the final 25-lap race the opening 14 laps before mechanical 
troubles forced him out of the race. 
</P>
<P>
 Daniels inherited the lead and held off Woodside to win his second main event 
of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Grand American Modified class, three-time defending champion and 
current points leader Dave Phipps of Simi Valley posted his fourth feature win 
of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 20-lap Mini Stock Racing Assn. main event, Glendora High senior Richie 
Lloyd won his second feature race of the season.

NORTHRIDGE ADVANCES TO LITTLE LEAGUE REGIONAL WITH 11-0 WIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRYAN RODGERS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Perhaps it was a gesture of mercy when the outfield lights went out 
temporarily during Saturday night's Southern California Division II final 
between the Northridge and Whittier Little League all-star teams. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, the inevitable was about to happen. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge was en route to an 11-0 victory at Lilac Park, earning a berth in 
this week's four-team Western Regionals in San Bernardino. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the first Northridge team to win a division title since 1975, and the 
team has strong hitting and the pitching of Nathaniel Dunlap to thank. 
</P>
<P>
 Dunlap pitched a one-hitter, struck out nine and walked none. Only a 
ground-ball single in the first inning kept him from pitching a perfect game. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's very disciplined for a 12-year-old," Northridge Coach Larry Baca said of 
Dunlap. "In the 13 years I've been coaching here, he's probably the best 
pitcher I've seen. And we've had some guys go on to the pros." 
</P>
<P>
 Once again, Northridge (12-0) served notice that it is a team that can hit. 
</P>
<P>
 Angered by a recent story in a San Bernardino paper that suggested the team's 
hitting was sub-par, Northridge has been on a tear in the two games since, 
scoring 34 runs. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge had 12 hits, including three home runs. 
</P>
<P>
 In the third, Matt Cassel and Jonathon Higashi each ripped home runs. By the 
end of the third inning, Northridge held a 7-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 In the fifth, Peter Tuber hit a three-run home run to center field, his fourth 
in as many division games, to make the score 10-0. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Tuber was celebrating his 13th birthday. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a special home run, because it's my birthday and we wanted to win so 
badly," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first inning, Northridge parlayed three singles and an error into three 
runs. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, Northridge will take on a team from Alaska at 5 p.m. The winner of 
the double-elimination regional advances to the Little League World Series in 
Williamsport, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
 Cassel, who finished three for four with two runs batted in, said, "Now that 
we're going to regionals, all we have to do is win the (World Series) flag."

 The Woodland Hills Tigers defeated the Norwalk Rebels, 7-4, at Downey High on 
Saturday to advance to the final of the Stan Musial regional tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tigers (34-9), composed of college and semipro players, would advance to 
the state tournament with a victory today. 
</P>

 Mike Jenkins (6-0), formerly of Simi Valley High, went six innings, allowing 
three hits and two earned runs. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tigers trailed, 3-0, before scoring six runs in the third inning. Two-run 
doubles by Brent Christenson, a Brigham Young player formerly of Thousand Oaks 
High, and Paul Blair Jr. highlighted the inning.

EX-ANGEL RECONSIDERS HIS MOVES; VAN BURKLEO PONDERS PATH OF HIS CAREERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE HISERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There is supposed to be a time when a man can look into life's rear-view 
mirror and correctly gauge the weight of his choices. 
</P>
<P>
 Isn't hindsight always 20-20? 
</P>
<P>
 Not true for Ty Van Burkleo, 30, a former Angel and former Chatsworth High and 
Valley College standout who is in his 13th pro season.  
</P>
<P>
 The jury remains out on the biggest decision of his career. "I don't like 
second-guessing myself," said Van Burkleo, the top slugger on the triple-A 
Colorado Springs Sky Sox. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet he does. Constantly. Has done so for years. 
</P>
<P>
 Late in the spring of 1987, Van Burkleo left the Angels' double-A affiliate in 
Midland, Tex., in the early stages of what promised to be his best year. In 48 
games and after 183 at-bats, he was batting .328, with 12 home runs and 33 runs 
batted in. 
</P>
<P>
 He was heading east -- The Far East -- as a member of the Seibu Lions of 
Japan's Pacific League. The Lions, who for a year had been charting Van 
Burkleo's progress as a power-hitting first baseman and outfielder, bought his 
contract from the Angels. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Burkleo played the better part of five seasons in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 As he reflects, his stay seems longer. "While I was over there it was real 
hard for me to give up the major league dream," said Van Burkleo, relaxing 
before a recent Pacific Coast League game against the Phoenix Firebirds. "I was 
always thinking, 'Why did I sell myself out?' 
</P>
<P>
 "I was just starting to come into my own when I went over there." 
</P>
<P>
 Then again . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard to say I made the wrong decision. Maybe things wouldn't have panned 
out here. At least now I have some money in my pocket." 
</P>
<P>
 Van Burkleo, his high school sweetheart, Christine, and their children, 
Brittany, 8, Cameron, 3, and Sierra, 1, live during the off-season in a 
luxurious 5,000-square-foot home adjacent to a golf course in Mesa, Ariz. They 
also rent out a townhome they own near Channel Islands Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
 Sell out, indeed. Theirs are not exactly minor league digs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a beautiful home and we have a nice lifestyle," Van Burkleo said. 
"There's something to be said for being able to provide that for your family." 
</P>
<P>
 Was the trade-off worth it? 
</P>
<P>
 Van Burkleo thinks back to 1985 when he was playing in Rohnert Park, Calif., 
for the Class-A Redwood City Angels. 
</P>
<P>
 The furniture in the apartment that he and Christine shared consisted of two 
backyard lounge chairs and a television -- financed at $20 per month -- set on 
a box. They slept on a used boxspring purchased from a budget motel chain. 
</P>
<P>
 Christine, who was pregnant with Brittany, worked part-time for the club in 
the ticket booth. The job was not one taken simply to stay close to her 
husband. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were struggling," Van Burkleo said. "We needed that job." 
</P>
<P>
 He recalls one day, after a pregnancy check-up, Christine breaking down in 
tears at the doctor's office. The physician's charge for the visit was $25. She 
didn't have it. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't until a few years later, in Midland, that things started to look up. 
In the Texas League there is the kindly tradition of passing the hat for a home 
player who has slugged a home run. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Burkleo remembers the greeting Christine gave him the first time he came 
home with extra cash in his pocket: "She was excited because she could finally 
buy the iron she wanted," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 A few months later, that iron, and the rest of their belongings, was packed 
for Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lions sent representatives to Jackson, Miss., to watch Van Burkleo play in 
a three-game series. The ballpark in Jackson is the biggest in the Texas 
League, but in each of the first two games, Van Burkleo belted homers over the 
scoreboard. 
</P>
<P>
 Convinced they had found their man, the Japanese scouts left. The next game, 
Van Burkleo fanned four times. 
</P>
<P>
 Perfect timing. 
</P>
<P>
 In Japan, the young couple were quickly enveloped by culture shock. Arriving 
at the airport, they were led through a tunnel lined five-deep with reporters 
and camera crews. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody walking with us is looking around like, 'Who's with us?' and we're 
doing the same thing, looking back like, 'Where's the president?' " Van Burkleo 
said. "Then we find out they're there for us!" 
</P>
<P>
 That was only the beginning of his indoctrination into Japanese baseball, 
where the actual rules of the game are the only things typical of America's 
national pastime. 
</P>
<P>
 Suffering from jet lag, Van Burkleo woke up at 4 in the morning and looked out 
the window. Some 30 stories below, on a field adjacent to the hotel, a ballgame 
was under way between teams of white-collar workers. 
</P>
<P>
 "They love baseball there, but fields are so hard to come by that people have 
to reserve them months in advance, and at ridiculous hours," Van Burkleo said. 
</P>
<P>
 Later the same day, he took batting practice, then held his first formal press 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
 Pumped up by all the attention, Van Burkleo put on a show during the workout, 
launching several prodigious home runs. 
</P>
<P>
 Meeting the press that day, Van Burkleo said he "felt like Bo Jackson." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm standing there at the podium in this huge room, wearing my Lions uniform, 
and people are asking me all kinds of questions and I'm thinking, 'Hell, I was 
released (by the Milwaukee Brewers) three years ago!' " 
</P>
<P>
 The next morning, Van Burkleo's interpreter met him with a pile of newspapers 
-- all trumpeting the exploits of the previous day's hitting display. Some of 
the accounts even included photos of the stadium with diagrams of where his 
home runs landed. 
</P>
<P>
 Joining the team in midseason, Van Burkleo put up respectable numbers, batting 
.279 with six home runs and 20 RBIs in 34 games. 
</P>
<P>
 That set the stage for 1988, the best full season of his career. But first 
came his inaugural winter and spring of Japanese training. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pre-spring training" was held at a remote hotel on the island of Shikoku. The 
players were roused each morning at 7 over an intercom system hooked up to 
their individual rooms. At that, they hurriedly threw on sweat clothes and made 
their way down to the beach for calisthenics. 
</P>
<P>
 Before exercising, rookie players were required to stand at the water's edge 
and shout, Van Burkleo said, something along the lines of, "Good morning Mr. 
Ocean. My name is (fill in the blank) and I am going to work hard today . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 "Guys just stood there screaming out into the ocean while probably 150 fans 
watched them embarrass themselves," Van Burkleo said. 
</P>
<P>
 After training, the players hiked back up to the hotel for a typical breakfast 
of seeweed mulch, fermented soy beans, squid in a squid-gut sauce and rice. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Burkleo, who boasts of having a "cast-iron stomach" said he never had a 
problem with Japanese cuisine -- except at breakfast. 
</P>
<P>
 When he asked for "an American breakfast," Van Burkleo was served a sirloin 
steak, a dinner salad, a roll and steamed vegetables. Reacting with typically 
glib humor, he responded, "Look guys, just round me up some cornflakes and 
we'll call it even." 
</P>
<P>
 The weather still was cold and snowy on Jan. 26, the first day of regular 
spring training. When the players arrived at the stadium they were told to jog 
around the field. After 30 minutes, they stopped and stretched. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, for 30 more minutes, they again jogged around the field, this time in 
the opposite direction. When they finally stopped, Van Burkleo, now dog-tired, 
remembers wondering when they would play some baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 No time soon. For the next two hours the players ran 100-meter sprints. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was the most incredible, ridiculous thing," Van Burkleo said. "Guys were 
dropping like flies. It was like they were trying to get us in shape in one 
day." 
</P>
<P>
 Van Burkleo hurt his Achilles' heel and, while favoring the injury the next 
day, strained the knee of his other leg. Barely able to walk, he was shipped to 
minor league spring training where trainers made various therapeutic attempts, 
including messages and acupuncture, to heal him. 
</P>
<P>
 His stay was short. When Van Burkleo was well enough to hit, he began pelting 
home runs so far over the stadium's right-field fence that they hit business 
buildings, parked cars and, occasionally, narrowly missed pedestrians. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the people back there got tired of playing dodge ball they complained to 
the general manager and he had me moved back to the major league team," Van 
Burkleo said. "I was too dangerous." 
</P>
<P>
 But with his knee still hurting, Van Burkleo still wasn't ready to resume 
full-scale workouts, which, among other disciplines, included swinging a bat a 
minimum of 1,000 times each day. 
</P>
<P>
 During a meeting one night, the Seibu manager was addressing his team in 
Japanese when Van Burkleo heard his name mentioned. 
</P>
<P>
 Curious, he asked his interpreter what had been said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The manager says he hopes that your knee gets better soon," he was told. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sitting there thinking, 'Hey, OK, nice guy,' " Van Burkleo said. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, a few of his teammates -- players who had learned some English during 
one year of training with a Class-A independent team in San Jose -- approached 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey, don't worry man. That's bull----," one of them said. "Don't worry about 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 Don't worry about what? Van Burkleo inquired. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, a more precise translation of what the manager had said was, "Van 
Burkleo, if your knee doesn't get better, we're going to ship you back to 
America." 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess that's kind of like saying, 'I hope your knee feels better,' " Van 
Burkleo quipped. 
</P>
<P>
 Undaunted, he went on to hit 38 home runs and drive in 90 runs in 366 at-bats. 
But adjusting culturally wasn't Van Burkleo's only challenge. 
</P>
<P>
 His manager, it seemed, wanted production -- but not too much of it. Van 
Burkleo often was removed for a pinch-hitter; either following a poor at-bat or 
when the Lions were up by several runs. 
</P>
<P>
 Six times he hit two home runs in a game and did not finish the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Also annoying was the penchant club officials had for chasing away the press. 
Van Burkleo didn't wish to be a glory hog, but he did enjoy the extra money. 
Television stations paid $100-$150 for each interview. 
</P>
<P>
 At the all-star break that year, Van Burkleo had 19 home runs and led the 
league in RBIs, yet his own manager passed over him for selection as an 
all-star reserve. 
</P>
<P>
 "He didn't like a double-A guy tearing up his league," Van Burkleo said. 
</P>
<P>
 The next two seasons he got off to slow starts and was buried on the bench by 
the end of April. In 1989, he batted .210 in 119 at-bats. The following season 
he had only 112 at-bats and batted .196. 
</P>
<P>
 Lions hitting instructors weren't much help. One of them suggested that Van 
Burkleo watch the ball with his left eye. "I'd pop up and be like, 'Damn! Must 
have looked at that with my right eye," Van Burkleo said. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the 1991 season, the Lions finally granted his request for a trade, 
shipping him to the power-starved Hiroshima Carp. 
</P>
<P>
 On April 4, opening day, Van Burkleo was the Carp's starting first baseman and 
clean-up hitter -- positions he held for half a game. After grounding out and 
then popping up with a runner on third and less than two outs, Van Burkleo was 
replaced by a pinch-hitter. 
</P>
<P>
 His next start was June 13. In the meantime, he made only three pinch-hitting 
appearances. 
</P>
<P>
 "I walked up hitting zero on June 13," Van Burkleo said with a laugh. "And 
they put me in there against a left-hander of course." He got two hits, one of 
them a home run. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Burkleo played in only 29 games for the Carp, who removed him from the 
active roster with about a month left in the season. 
</P>
<P>
 His career in Japan was over. Van Burkleo only hoped the same could not be 
said of his playing days in the states. Certainly he had conquered failure 
before. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Burkleo was not drafted out of high school. Professional clubs weren't 
interested until he made a particularly strong showing in the fall of 1981 
while playing for Valley College. 
</P>
<P>
 Ray Poitivant, a Brewers' scout, asked Van Burkleo how big of a bonus he 
wanted to sign as a free agent. "At the time, I was pretty set on going to 
college," Van Burkleo said. "So I thought I'd say something so outrageous that 
he would never get me." His price was $30,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Poitivant offered $10,000, which Van Burkleo flatly refused. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, the Brewers came up with the entire sum -- "called my bluff," Van 
Burkleo said. He signed. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Burkleo's first season, at Clinton, Iowa, of the Class-A Midwest League, 
he hit 22 home runs and had 65 RBIs. But less than two years later -- after 
struggling at Stockton of the Class-A California League -- he was released. 
</P>
<P>
 A reprieve came when the Angels signed Van Burkleo after watching him play for 
Dave Snow, his former coach at Valley College, as a member of the Fairbanks 
Goldpanners in the Alaska Summer League. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Burkleo finished the 1984 season batting .315 in 26 games for Peoria, 
Ill., of the Midwest League. But the next spring, he almost retired. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels wanted to send him back to the Midwest League, where Van Burkleo 
felt he had nothing else to prove. Christine had recently learned she was 
pregnant. He was 21, making $850 a month. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was going to have my wife come out and take a trip to the Grand Canyon with 
me, then go home and, I don't know, sell shoes or something," Van Burkleo said. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the Angels agreed to assign him to Redwood City, where Van Burkleo 
assured them he would beat out one of their prospects for a starting job. 
</P>
<P>
 At the start of the season he wasn't playing much, and not hitting when he 
did. He opened by getting three hits his first 38 at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
 When Van Burkleo stepped to the plate in one game his .079 batting average 
flashed on the scoreboard. "I'll never forget what my wife said to me that 
night," Van Burkleo recalled: "Gee, honey, I've never seen anyone with an 
average under a hundred before." 
</P>
<P>
 Thanks Snookums. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point, he went 15 days without playing and entertained the idea of 
changing positions. 
</P>
<P>
 The Redwood City pitching coach said he would try him in relief, but first he 
wanted clearance from the Angels' front office. 
</P>
<P>
 The next day, Van Burkleo was in the lineup at first base. Two hits, including 
a home run, and he was on his way to becoming a regular again. 
</P>
<P>
 The following season, after the Redwood City franchise relocated to Palm 
Springs, Van Burkleo hit 22 home runs with 108 RBIs, thereby earning his 1987 
promotion to Midland. 
</P>
<P>
 After his strong start in double-A, Van Burkleo thought he had discovered the 
fast track to the big leagues. There was just one problem: At first base, the 
Angels had Wally Joyner, the runner-up in balloting for the 1986 rookie of the 
year award. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of his decision to play in Japan, Van Burkleo said, was based on the 
limited future options the Angels offered. 
</P>
<P>
 But by the time he came back from Japan, he was far less picky. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels welcomed him back and Van Burkleo rewarded their confidence with a 
solid season at triple-A Edmonton in 1992. He batted .273 and was among PCL 
leaders with 19 home runs, 88 RBIs and 83 runs scored. Van Burkleo also stole 
20 bases, becoming only the third player in franchise history to hit more than 
15 home runs with as many stolen bases. 
</P>
<P>
 Back in triple-A last season, Van Burkleo rebounded from a slow start to bat 
.274 with six home runs and 56 RBIs and earn his first promotion to the big 
leagues. 
</P>
<P>
 His stint with the Angels lasted 12 games. In 33 at-bats, Van Burkleo had only 
five hits, including his first major league home run. And he would have had 
another had Twins outfielder Shane Mack not robbed him with an over-the-fence 
grab. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Burkleo has 30 days of major league service -- 27 with the Angels last 
season and three with the Colorado Rockies last week. He was promoted on the 
last Friday of July, after Andres Gallaraga sustained a season-ending injury, 
and returned to the Colorado Springs roster a week ago when outfielder Ellis 
Burks came off the disabled list. 
</P>
<P>
 He was 0 for 5, but remains optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even in triple-A you have your 4 a.m. wake-up calls and sometimes that makes 
you think, 'Good God, what am I doing?' " Van Burkleo said. "But I still play 
this game for the same reason I started. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's fun."

POSTCARD / ST. PETERSBURG; PERSPECTIVE COMES IN FORM OF A WET NAPKIN FOR 
AMERICAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

 After six hours in the sun while watching the triathlon competition, Susan, an 
American who is here working for the Goodwill Games, was hot and tired. She was 
hardly looking forward to the hour or more that she was about to spend on a bus 
to get back into the city. But her companion for the day, a young woman from 
St. Petersburg who is serving as a Goodwill Games volunteer, seemed to be 
enjoying the excursion into the Russian countryside. 
</P>
<P>
 "Susan," Lena asked at one point, "have you ever been to Finland?" 
</P>
<P>
 Susan nodded. 
</P>
<P>
 "Are things there much different than they are here?" 
</P>
<P>
 Later, in recounting the conversation, Susan said she responded that things 
are somewhat different in Finland. She chose not to tell Lena the whole truth. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would have broken her heart," Susan said. 
</P>
<P>
 On the surface, it appears as if the conditions here are not as different from 
the West as they were only a few years ago. Certainly, there is a remarkable 
increase in the availability of consumer goods, which now include everything 
from chocolate chip cookies to lap-top computers. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, they are not necessarily available to the average St. 
Petersburg resident. Prices prohibit virtually everyone except wealthy Russians 
or tourists from buying them. 
</P>
<P>
 And there are still some items we take for granted that are totally foreign 
here. 
</P>
<P>
 As she prepared to return to the city, Susan opened her purse and grabbed one 
of those wet napkins that restaurants in the United States routinely provide 
patrons and wiped her face. 
</P>
<P>
 She also gave one to Lena, who opened the package carefully, unfolded the 
napkin and pressed it against her face. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never smelled anything so clean," she told Susan. 
</P>
<P>
 Susan shrugged. 
</P>
<P>
 "Susan," Lena said, "why can't we have wonderful things like this in my 
country?" 
</P>
<P>
 Susan shrugged again. 
</P>
<P>
 As she wadded up her wet napkin and looked for a waste basket, Lena asked if 
it would be all right if she kept hers. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, Susan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Smiling, Lena neatly folded the wet napkin and placed it in her purse. RANDY

ANDERSEN CATCHES EARLY WAVES, SITS ON TOP OF SURFING WORLD 
</P>

<P>
 Lisa Andersen of Ormond Beach, Fla., made some early radical maneuvers and 
then used sound strategy in the 45-minute final heat Saturday to win the U.S. 
Open of Surfing at the Huntington Beach pier. 
</P>
<P>
 Andersen defeated former world champion Frieda Zamba of Flagler Beach, Fla., 
who won the Op Pro last weekend, also at Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Whereas Zamba started by taking fewer waves in an effort to pace herself, 
Anderson was less selective and surfed aggressively on the small waves she 
caught. 
</P>
<P>
 With 10 minutes to go, Andersen had caught 14 waves, one short of the maximum 
allowed. So, she paddled around the priority buoy and positioned herself near 
Zamba to try to stop her rival from getting a tournament-winning wave. 
</P>
<P>
 The strategy worked as Zamba failed to get the 7.33 needed to win. 
</P>
<P>
 In the longboarding final, Colin McPhillips of San Clemente defeated Joel 
Tudor of Cardiff, ending his eight-meet winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
 Men's surfing continues today with quarterfinals at 9 a.m, semifinals at 11 
a.m and the finals at 12:45 p.m. JODY BERGER

NEWSWIRE: MAVERICKS MAKE OFFER TO TARPLEY

<P>
 The Dallas Mavericks have made forward Roy Tarpley an offer to return to the 
team if he wins reinstatement to the NBA, a team official said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Maverick General Manager Norm Sonju said the team has made Tarpley a 
"substantial" multiyear offer contingent upon his winning approval to return to 
the NBA. Sonju said a decision from the NBA isn't expected until the end of 
August. 
</P>
<P>
 Tarpley, banned from the NBA in October of 1991 for violating the league's 
anti-drug policy, has played the past two seasons in Greece for Olympiakos. 
</P>
<P>
 Sonju declined to reveal the Mavericks' offer, but it reportedly is close to 
Tarpley's $3-million-per-year asking price. The Olympiakos' offer is believed 
to be less than $2 million for the season. Gymnastics  
</P>
<P>
 Kerri Strug, a 1992 Olympic gymnast, was in fair condition Saturday night with 
a back sprain she suffered in a fall off the parallel bars Friday night during 
a meet in Palm Springs. She landed on her chest and chin. 
</P>
<P>
 Strug, 17, of Tucson, Ariz., was expected to be released from Desert Hospital 
today, said Kathy Kelly, women's program director for U.S. Gymnastics. "The 
fall did look bad, but she's a very strong, very flexible girl and was able to 
withstand that with minor damage," Kelly said. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was walking around and laughing (Saturday). Her coaches are still 
optimistic that this is a minor injury and that she'll be able to train at the 
end of the week." Colleges

 Michelle Kwan celebrated a birthday one month ago today, but she is still so 
very young -- young enough that when her coach, Frank Carroll, told her the 
cliche Saturday morning about the tough getting going when the going gets 
tough, it did not sound like a cliche to her. 
</P>
<P>
 It sounded like inspiration, which she needed after floundering in her 
technical program on the opening day of the Goodwill Games women's figure 
skating competition Friday and finding herself in sixth place among eight 
skaters. 
</P>
<P>
 But, displaying poise beyond her 14 years, she returned to the Yubileiny 
Sports Palace on Saturday to give one of the best performances of her young 
career. She defeated World Championships silver-medalist and four-time European 
champion Surya Bonaly and everyone else in the freestyle program to vault to 
second place overall behind the 21-year-old Frenchwoman. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a new little notch in her belt, beating Surya in the free," said 
Carroll, who coaches Kwan, of Torrance, at Lake Arrowhead's International Ice 
Castles. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, unable to maintain his usual restraint, Carroll added, "Yes!" 
</P>
<P>
 Bonaly, who has been working temporarily with Carroll this summer at Lake 
Arrowhead, gave him nothing to exclaim about, at least not positively. When she 
committed to appear in this competition, she hinted that she would use it as an 
opportunity to become the first woman to land a quadruple jump. But even after 
finishing first in the technical program, she said that she would be lucky to 
remain upright on her double and triple jumps Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 She stood up, but, otherwise, there was not much in her program to scintillate 
the crowd of about 3,500 in the 7,000-seat arena. Dissatisfied with her skating 
boots, she wore one from a new pair and one from an old pair and had difficulty 
keeping balance. The only reason she was able to finish second in the freestyle 
program, which counts toward two-thirds of the final score, and hold on to 
first place overall is because the others who had a chance to unseat her skated 
as poorly or worse. 
</P>
<P>
 The seven judges had a hard time sorting out the mess, not unusual for a 
mid-summer competition. About the only thing they could agree upon is that the 
other two Americans, Nicole Bobek of Chicago and Elaine Zayak of Paramus, N.J., 
belonged in the seventh and eight places. 
</P>
<P>
 No woman scored higher than a 5.7, on a 6.0 scale, for technical merit or 
artistic impression. Besides Kwan and Bonaly, two Russians, Maria Butyrskaya, 
who finished third overall, and Olga Markova, who was fourth, also received 
first-place votes for their freestyle programs. Kwan won that phase of the 
competition because she also had three second-place votes and a third. Then 
there was an inexplicable sixth from an Estonian judge. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think he knows one jump from another," Carroll said. 
</P>
<P>
 One of only three women who did not fall, Kwan had the most technically 
demanding program as she attempted, and landed, seven triple jumps. But Carroll 
was even more impressed with the mature presentation of her new freestyle 
program, skated to music by Saint-Saens. It is her first classically oriented 
long program after going with lighter, bouncier fare in the past. 
</P>
<P>
 She also is improving at selling her performance, something that she said she 
has learned from watching Olympic champion Oksana Baiul of Ukraine. Kwan smiled 
whenever she remembered that she was supposed to Saturday and blew a kiss to 
the crowd when she finished. 
</P>
<P>
 She still has difficulty putting her performances into perspective for 
reporters, but the high-five she gave her father, Danny, in the hallway 
afterward said it all. 
</P>
<P>
 Carroll was at least equally enthused, but said he does not want to get 
carried away. It would be easy to do. Before Kwan's 14th birthday, she had 
finished first in the junior world championships, first in the U.S. Olympic 
Festival and second in the national championships. Now, she has a freestyle 
victory over Bonaly and a silver medal from the Goodwill Games. Goodwill Notes

 Lisa Leslie scored 24 points as the U.S. women's basketball team rolled to a 
105-73 victory over China to advance to the women's basketball final. Dawn 
Staley added 21, Ruthie Bolton-Holifield had 15 and Sheryl Swoopes scored 11. 
The U.S. women, seeking their first gold medal in major international 
competition since 1990, face France in Sunday's final. The French, led by 
Isabelle Fijalkowski with 20 points, defeated Russia, 80-73, in the other 
semifinal. . . . Chinese divers won gold and bronze in the women's 10-meter 
platform diving. Xiong Min won with more than 429 points. Mary Ellen Clark of 
the United States was second with Deng Yong third. . . . American Ruth Davidon 
won the gold medal in the women's 500-meter single sculls. The men's 500 
singles sculls also went to an American, Jason Gailes.

DEL MAR; FLAWLESSLY WINS THIRD RAMONA TO TIE RECORD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL CHRISTINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When Neil Drysdale saddled Firm Pledge, a 26-1 shot, to win the second race 
Saturday at Del Mar, hunch players wondered if this would be a tipoff on the 
$316,000 Ramona Handicap three hours later. 
</P>
<P>
 Drysdale has won only three races at Del Mar since 1992, but now, with favored 
Hollywood Wildcat running in the Ramona, he could win two on the same day. 
</P>
<P>
 There was an omen from the second race, but it wasn't in favor of Drysdale. 
Firm Pledge is a gelded son of Affirmed, and Flawlessly was the only other 
offspring of the 1978 Triple Crown champion running on the card. She held off 
Hollywood Wildcat and withstood a foul claim from Zoonaqua's rider, Alex Solis, 
to win the Ramona for the third consecutive year. 
</P>
<P>
 This was the most difficult of the three. In 1992, trainer Charlie 
Whittingham's mare beat Re Toss by three lengths; last year, she was one length 
better than Heart Of Joy. There was only a head's difference at the wire 
Saturday, with Eddie Delahoussaye, Hollywood Wildcat's jockey, forced to swing 
wide and finish in the center of the track after Chris McCarron and Flawlessly 
kept them pinned in, behind the three tightly packed front-runners, at the top 
of the stretch. 
</P>
<P>
 When Flawlessly cut the corner, inside her and in front of Hollywood Wildcat 
were Skimble, Lyin To The Moon and Zoonaqua. Because of Flawlessly and Lyin To 
The Moon, the hole closed for Solis and Zoonaqua, but after reviewing the race, 
the three stewards ruled that there was no interference. 
</P>
<P>
 Flawlessly, who is owned and bred by Louis and Patrice Wolfson, who also raced 
Affirmed, joined Native Diver as the only horses to win a Del Mar stake three 
consecutive times. Native Diver won the San Diego Handicap three consecutive 
times, carrying 131 pounds for the third victory in 1965. 
</P>
<P>
 Flawlessly, carrying 124 pounds, the same as Hollywood Wildcat, ran 1 1/8 
miles on the grass in 1:48 1/5, the same as her time a year ago and matching 
the stakes record by Street Dancer in 1972. Paying $4.60 as the second choice 
behind the 4-5 Hollywood Wildcat, Flawlessly earned $181,000, sending her purse 
total over the $2.2-million mark. No other offspring of Affirmed has earned 
that much. 
</P>
<P>
 Skimble, who set modest fractions for the first mile, finished third, 1 1/4 
lengths behind Hollywood Wildcat. It was another two lengths back to Lyin To 
The Moon, who was 3 1/2 lengths in front of Zoonaqua in last. 
</P>
<P>
 Flawlessly was in fourth place, six lengths behind Skimble, midway down the 
backstretch, with Hollywood Wildcat running close to the rail, a length farther 
back. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't have a set plan in a race like this," McCarron said. "On paper, I 
thought I'd be laying fourth with Eddie (Delahoussaye) on my outside. But it 
didn't happen that way. I had a dream trip. I got clear on the outside and my 
mare fired. She's special. She's surely the best mare I've ever ridden on the 
grass. Without a doubt." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Joe Harper, the general manager of Del Mar, glanced out at the track Friday 
night as the gate crew struggled for several minutes to get a balky horse 
loaded for the eighth and final race. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we had another race to run, I'd be a very nervous man right now," Harper 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Del Mar, which usually has a 2 p.m. first post, started Friday's experimental 
twilight card at 4 p.m., and darkness was near as the last race went off 
slightly past 7:30. 
</P>
<P>
 Business was so good Friday -- on-track attendance of 18,797 was up 49% over 
the total for the comparable day the year before, and betting, counting 
off-track, reached $8.1 million, compared to $6.6 million on nine races in 1993 
-- that Harper said there would be more twilight cards next year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're affected by the amount of daylight, and we wouldn't be able to race 
twilights on Fridays all the way into September," Harper said. "But we'll see 
how much daylight there is on the early Fridays of the meet and go from there." 
Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Blues Traveller, who has won three out of his last four starts, including the 
American Handicap at Hollywood Park on July 4, is a lukewarm 3-1 favorite on 
the morning line for today's Eddie Read Handicap. Next at 7-2 is Fastness, who 
won an allowance at Hollywood on July 9, his first start in more than six 
months because of surgery for a chipped knee. Trainer Bobby Frankel, who has 
won the Read six of the 20 times it's been run, will saddle Wharf, who is 
listed at 8-1.

VICTORY DREAM TAKES LEAD EARLY, WINS HAMBLETONIAN 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Victory Dream, driven by Mike Lachance, took the lead with little less than 
three-quarters of a mile remaining on the Meadowlands' one-mile track and won 
the Hambletonian for 3-year-old trotters Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the greatest thing in the world," trainer Ron Gurfein said after the 
final. 
</P>
<P>
 Victory Dream, who won by 2 3/4 lengths over Mr Lavec, was timed in 1:54 1/5. 
Bye Tsem finished third and Smasher was fourth in the 10-horse field. 
</P>
<P>
 Victory Dream paid $2.80, $2.20 and $2.20 in the final for his eighth victory 
in 10 starts this year and 11th in 15 career races. All of his starts have been 
at the Meadowlands. 
</P>
<P>
 Victory Dream, owned by FA Stable and Victory Dream Stable of Lindenhurst, 
N.Y., earned $50,000 for his elimination heat victory and $500,000 for his 
victory in the $1-million final. Each elimination was worth $100,000.

THE UGLY DUCKLINGS OF TRAVEL RECORD HANDSOME PROFITS; INDUSTRY: COMMUTER 
AIRLINES HAVE CARVED OUT A NICHE, FILLING SHORTER ROUTES THAT THEIR LARGER 
COUNTERPARTS HAVE ABANDONED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 His black valise in tow and a blank stare on his face, Christopher Atayan 
waits to board a small American Eagle turboprop that he dubs "the flying sewer 
pipe." 
</P>
<P>
 Atayan logs 100,000 air miles a year as a New York investment banker. Too many 
of them, he said, are aboard cramped little puddle jumpers like the one he 
waits to board. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are small, they feel unsafe, are noisy and slow," he groused while 
slumping against a check-in counter inside the air-conditioned confines of 
Orange County's John Wayne Airport. Still, "you have to fly them." 
</P>
<P>
 True to his word, Atayan troops out on the sun-baked Tarmac to climb aboard 
the 19-passenger British Aerospace turboprop for the hop to Los Angeles 
International Airport, where he will thankfully transfer to a wide-body jet for 
the ride home to the East Coast. 
</P>
<P>
 Few products or services can match the animosity that some travelers hold 
toward commuter airlines. Not only are the industry's smaller, propeller-driven 
planes derided as airborne lawn mowers, passengers have to pay handsomely for 
the privilege of being jostled through what many consider not-so-friendly 
skies. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet commuter carriers have become the quiet victors of the recent airline 
wars. Complain as they may, some 53 million passengers flew aboard commuter 
aircraft last year -- a 25% increase in two years -- according to an industry 
group. 
</P>
<P>
 Commuter affiliates have stepped in to take over service on less-popular runs 
that are being abandoned by the major airlines. The majors are desperate to cut 
costs to make up for the more than $8 billion lost in ruinous fare wars in the 
past few years. 
</P>
<P>
 Little airlines have discovered they can turn a tidy profit flying their small 
planes on routes that the bigger carriers left behind. For instance, SkyWest 
picked up Delta Air Lines flights that had been dropped from Salt Lake City to 
Casper, Wyo.; Rapid City and Sioux Falls, S.D.; and Butte, Mont. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a good deal, too, for the retreating carriers. By relinquishing 
unprofitable routes to their commuter affiliates, they continue to be fed 
passengers into their profitable, long-haul routes in a bid to retain customer 
loyalty. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since 1988, the major carriers have turned over 65% of their routes of 500 
miles or less to their regional partners. That's where the growth has been," 
said Walt Coleman, president of the Regional Airlines Assn., a Washington-based 
industry group. 
</P>
<P>
 Financially, the commuter carriers have many of the traits that major airlines 
hope to emulate as they restructure. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every factor of our cost structure is lower," said Marty Hires, spokesman for 
American Eagle, a group of four commuter airlines affiliated with American 
Airlines that covers most of the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Regional airlines are flexible, able to add or delete routes within days based 
on market conditions. Their upper management isn't slowed by large 
bureaucracies that have characterized some big carriers, so service problems 
can often be fixed with a single phone call. 
</P>
<P>
 Commuter carriers usually have loyal work forces that are paid less and they 
are not hamstrung by rigorous union work rules that old-line carriers say make 
them less competitive with cost-cutting upstarts. Their smaller size results in 
a greater sense of teamwork. 
</P>
<P>
 "With SkyWest, you're never far away from home. It's a family," said Jamie 
Berry, a Palm Springs-based flight attendant. 
</P>
<P>
 At the commuters, everybody pitches in, from pilots to managers, when it comes 
to getting planes in and out as quickly as possible -- usually within 10 
minutes from touchdown. "I love to work the ramp," said Jeff Keller, Orange 
County station chief for Delta affiliate SkyWest Airlines. 
</P>
<P>
 Co-pilot Bryan Salvati personally helps passengers negotiate the steps off the 
plane, loads bags and still flies a schedule that would leave many of his peers 
looking like slackers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Seven stops, and that's an easy day," said the ex-Trans World Airlines 
employee as he eyed a wrinkled flight schedule he pulled from his coat pocket. 
"I love it. . . . The flying is better for me and I like working with a smaller 
group." 
</P>
<P>
 A commuter pilot with six years of experience can expect to make $32,000 to 
$40,000, while their counterparts at major airline earn $72,000 to $90,000, 
according to FAPA, an Atlanta-based career and financial planning service for 
airline employees. Experienced flight attendants average about $16,800 on the 
commuters -- a third less than the average $25,200 wage for attendants on major 
carriers. Mechanics earn about $13 an hour, compared to $19.50 at a major 
carrier. 
</P>
<P>
 Commuter pilots "are going to be working harder. The benefits are going to 
more skimpy," said R. Greg Carr, executive director of FAPA's Career Center. 
The situation has remain unchanged over the years since, because commuters are 
often viewed as a training ground for the larger airlines. 
</P>
<P>
 With the pay disparity, it's no wonder that pilots' union agreements with 
major airlines generally carry a standard clause that prevents their commuter 
affiliates from flying anything other than smaller planes, usually limited to 
70 seats. 
</P>
<P>
 That way, lower-paid pilots can't take jobs away from the major airline crews, 
according to FAPA President Louis Smith. "It would be easier for management to 
play them off each other" without the clauses, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some major airlines own their own commuter carriers outright and operate them 
as separate entities. American Airlines' parent AMR Corp. of Ft. Worth, Tex., 
for instance, owns all of the companies around the country that fly under the 
American Eagle commuter carrier. 
</P>
<P>
 Lower cost structures allow the commuter carriers to make money even if they 
are flying less than full. Even with planes of 70 seats or less, commuter 
carriers generally have break-even operations if they fill half the plane -- 
compared to 60% capacity needed for the major airlines, according to the 
Regional Airline Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the reason is the airplanes themselves. A 50- to 70-seat turboprop 
costs less than half as much to operate as a jet with twice as many seats, said 
Ken Roberts, manager of business operations for the Allison Engine Co. in 
Indianapolis, which makes both jets and turboprops. Propeller planes have lower 
fuel costs because they are smaller, and they are generally easier to maintain. 
</P>
<P>
 Another reason for healthy profit margins are the generally higher fares that 
commuter airlines can charge on many routes to otherwise isolated destinations. 
</P>
<P>
 "On the short legs, sometimes they will make you pay dearly because most times 
there isn't competition," said David Stempler, executive director of the 
International Airline Passengers Assn. in Washington, a lobbying group. 
</P>
<P>
 A ticket on a flight between Orange County and Los Angeles -- a 35-mile jaunt 
on which five commuter carriers compete -- generally costs about $55 one way, 
although a connection onto a major carrier can severely cut the cost. 
</P>
<P>
 Industry representatives defend the fares as representative of the costs of 
flying. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ever since Southwest (Airlines) entered the world, we think every fare should 
be $69," said Ron Reber, a SkyWest Airlines senior vice president in St. 
George, Utah. He added that his airlines' fares average about $100 one way with 
the average trip being about 400 miles. 
</P>
<P>
 At those distances and prices, commuters face their biggest competition not 
from each other, but from the automobile. "For every body we carry on the 
airplane, hundreds -- possibly thousands -- are driving," Reber said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lois Keifer, flying from John Wayne Airport to Los Angeles in order to connect 
to a flight home to New York, looked puzzled when asked why not just drive to 
Los Angeles. "I'd have to rent a car, drop off the car and get a shuttle for 
the terminal. It's too much hassle." 
</P>
<P>
 To lure more of the traveling executives that make up their core customer 
base, commuter airlines have been looking for answers short of their own 
miniature version of a fare war. They have taken several steps to make their 
planes more comfortable. 
</P>
<P>
 Small jets are now being used on some routes, cutting travel time over longer 
distances. SkyWest has bought four 50-seat commuter jetliners that are being 
used on runs like Salt Lake City to Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
 And some of the newer, bigger turboprop planes have cabins with high enough 
ceilings that passengers don't have to stoop when they board. Flight attendants 
serve drinks and snacks. And the commuter airline fleet is generally young -- 6 
years old or less -- with the latest in cockpit avionics. 
</P>
<P>
 "People look at propellers and think 'old-time airplanes,' " association 
official Coleman said, "but they are not." 
</P>
<P>
 People say they are willing to fly them for a simple reason: convenience. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's only about 10 minutes' air time, but it's worth it," said Al Butler, a 
technical engineer who drives from his Long Beach home to Orange County to fly 
a commuter to Los Angeles International rather than simply drive the 35 miles 
to the international airport. Parking costs half as much in Orange County, he 
explained. 
</P>
<P>
 Safety is an issue in many people's minds, given how commuter airplanes are 
generally dwarfed on runways by the big jets. Those fears were not helped by a 
National Transportation Safety Board examination of the industry that was 
launched in March and prompted by a crash in Minnesota that killed all 18 
aboard a commuter flight. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have a consistently higher accident rate than the major airlines," said 
Ted Lopatkiewicz, a spokesman for the NTSB in Washington. The agency is 
discussing whether to require that planes with 30 seats or fewer be required to 
meet the same rigorous safety standards of larger aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
 Given customer preference for jets, commuter carriers are quick to withdraw 
service if they are challenged by low-cost jet service from a major airline on 
one of their routes. Witness the quick exit of United Express from its Orange 
County-to-Oakland routes when Southwest Airlines entered the market in May with 
advance purchase fares as low as $49 each way, about half of what United 
Express was charging for a trip that took twice as long. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't compete with Southwest. Only a fool would do that against a jet with 
$49 fares," said Rolly Bergeson, president of Westair in Fresno, which flies in 
the West as United Express. 
</P>
<P>
 Some, however, have gotten lucky. When Southwest unit Morris Air started 
Boeing 737 service on SkyWest's Fresno-to-Las Vegas run, the commuter airline 
decided to stay put. It was hoping, successfully it turned out, that Morris 
would pull out when it couldn't sell enough tickets to justify jet service. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to define our markets. Our markets are not the same," Reber said. 
"You can't out-Southwest Southwest." 
</P>
<P>
 Steering clear of major competitors and charting their markets around the 
Bakersfields and Modestos of the world has paid off for the commuter industry. 
Most of the major players are profitable, usually more so than the major 
airlines with which they have forged alliances. 
</P>
<P>
 SkyWest Inc., for instance, announced record profits of $14.4 million in its 
most recent fiscal year, more than double the previous year's. By contrast, its 
giant affiliate Delta Air Lines had profits of only $10.8 million in its most 
recent fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, even the newest of jet carriers is anxious to dip into the 
commuter market. 
</P>
<P>
 The most recent convert is Nevada-based Reno Air, which announced July 14 that 
it signed a deal to start Reno Air Express, flying propeller-driven Jetstreams 
from its San Jose hub to Northern California cities such as Chico and Eureka. 
</P>
<P>
 Reno Air, only 2 years old and with no more than 17 jetliners itself, felt it 
needed a commuter affiliate to expand its presence at its hub in San Jose. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think it will increase our niche in the West and this is an excellent way 
to do that," said spokeswoman Sue Putnam. And why not? The arrangement with New 
York-based partner Phoenix Leasing won't cost Reno Air anything except some 
accounting and ticket processing charges. 
</P>
<P>
 "We won't make any predictions" about success, she added, "but we think there 
is an excellent market there." 
</P>
<P>
 Reno Air will have a ready customer base in people like Donald and Hazel 
Wright, a pair of retirees from Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple were taking a commuter plane on the trip home from seeing their 
grandchildren. They flew by commuter to Los Angeles, by major airline to 
Washington, and then took a second commuter hop to Charlottesville, Va. 
</P>
<P>
 Any concerns about the noise of the plane? "It's fine as far as I'm 
concerned," Donald Wright said. 
</P>
<P>
 And it beats driving. "It's easier for our son. He lives 10 minutes from 
here." The Top Five

HOT PROPERTY: BACK ACROSS POND FOR BOND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 SEAN CONNERY, who plays a cameo role as a Scottish doctor in the upcoming 
movie "A Good Man in Africa," has put his Avenue of the Stars condo in Century 
City on the market at $650,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Connery, who will turn 64 on Aug. 25, is selling the unit "so he can be based 
in Spain and England," said listing agent Delphine Mann of Jon Douglas Co., 
Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oscar-winning actor ("The Untouchables," 1987), who became a '60s icon as 
Agent 007, super-spy James Bond, was treated for a throat condition last fall 
that briefly left him unable to speak, but he has worked since then on "A Good 
Man," which will be released Sept. 9. 
</P>
<P>
 His two-bedroom, 1,600-square-foot condo, on one of the upper floors of a 
high-rise building, has a panoramic view of a golf course where Connery is said 
to have spent many hours. He is also a golfing member of Sherwood Country Club, 
near Westlake Village. 
</P>
<P>
 Connery, subject of the 1994 biography "Great Scot," was born in Scotland, 
where golf was so popular in the 15th Century that a law was passed then 
prohibiting it, because people were playing the new game instead of practicing 
archery, a military necessity. 
</P>
<P>
 Connery likes golf so much that two years after his 11-year marriage to 
actress Diane Cilento ended in divorce, he married his golfing buddy, French 
painter Micheline Roquebrune. Their primary residence has been in Marbella, 
Spain. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bel-Air home that actor BURT REYNOLDS and actress LONI ANDERSON leased in 
1990 and lived in together until they were separated last year is available for 
lease now at $35,000 a month, furnished. The home was rented to the couple at 
$40,000 a month, sources said then. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson relocated earlier this summer to a Beverly Hills-area home that she 
purchased for about $2.3 million. Reynolds, who has owned a ranch in Florida 
for many years, leased an Encino home at $20,000 a month after he filed for 
divorce in June, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bel-Air home, owned by a local businessman, is on nearly two acres off of 
Mulholland Drive and has Valley views, a tennis court, seven bedrooms and a 
guest apartment. It is listed with Linda May of Fred Sands Estates, Beverly 
Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 FAYE DUNAWAY, who no sooner finished shooting "Don Juan de Marco and the 
Centerfold" with Johnny Depp and Marlon Brando in July than she hired a law 
firm to handle her suit against producer-composer Andrew Lloyd Webber for 
closing "Sunset Boulevard" in Los Angeles before she could open in the show, 
has re-listed her Beverly Hills home, this time at $1,995,000. 
</P>
<P>
 She had listed the Cape Cod-style home last fall at just under $2.4 million. 
Then, this spring, while being discussed as a possible successor to Glenn Close 
in "Sunset Boulevard," Dunaway leased out her residence and rented a smaller 
place nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 Her tenants, some victims of the January earthquake, moved out in July, and 
Dunaway re-listed her home, which has four bedrooms and a guest house, with 
Stephen Shapiro of Stan Herman/Stephen Shapiro & Associates, Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 HARRY REINSCH, former president of Bechtel Corp., and his wife, HELEN, have 
sold their South Laguna home for close to its assessed valuation of $7.5 
million, sources say. 
</P>
<P>
 The Reinsches originally listed the home in 1989 at $22 million. They wanted 
to sell it because they already had homes in San Francisco and Rancho Mirage, 
and they weren't using the Laguna home much, sources said then. The 
Italian-style villa, on an acre, has nine bedrooms in 15,000 square feet, with 
100 feet of ocean frontage. 
</P>
<P>
 The sellers were represented by Louise Turner, Nancy Turner Casebier and Don 
Stratton of Turner Associates, Laguna Beach, and the buyer, an international 
businessman, was represented by Roger Clark of Clark Real Estate, Newport 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 German industrialist PETER DUSSMANN and his wife, KATHERINE, have purchased a 
home on the water in Malibu Colony, which they plan to tear down to build a 
home with a pool. 
</P>
<P>
 Carol Rapf of Pritchett-Rapf & Associates in Malibu represented the Dussmanns 
in buying the home. It sold for just under $2 million, other sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 The industrialist, who lunched with President Clinton and Chancellor Helmut 
Kohl last month in Germany, and his wife maintain their primary residence in 
Munich, but they also own a home with a pool on the land side of Malibu Colony, 
which they listed with Rapf at $1.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Sellers of the home bought by the Dussmanns were represented by Mike Silverman 
of Mike Silverman Estates, a Jon Douglas Co., and Irene Dazzan of Jon Douglas 
Co., Malibu.

CLUTTER BUSTERS; TIPS ON HOW PEOPLE WITH 'PACK-RAT SYNDROME' CAN PUT THEIR 
HOMES IN ORDER AND ORGANIZE THEIR LIVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VIVIEN SANTANA HUGHES, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The reactions to my announcement ranged from astonishment to disgust. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm taking a week off to organize my house," I said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why?!" gasped one friend as if in pain. 
</P>
<P>
 "Get a life," snapped a co-worker in exasperation. 
</P>
<P>
 "But your house looks so neat," another friend said with a supportive pat on 
the arm. 
</P>
<P>
 Then my mother said, "It's about time!" 
</P>
<P>
 As only a mom can, she knew the truth: I'm a closet slob. (I wonder if this 
admission can get me on the cover of People?) 
</P>
<P>
 Other than the kitchen counters piled with fairly neat stacks of kids' school 
papers, most of my mess is usually hidden. Every drawer is a junk drawer; the 
closets still have baby rompers hanging in them, and my youngest is a husky 4 
year old. After five moves in as many years, the boxes I haven't sorted through 
yet have labels like, "Things From Under the Bed at Poppy Peak Drive." We left 
that house in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 You'd think moving often would help my affliction. No. The boxes, piles, 
stuffed dresser drawers arrive intact. Who has time for meaningful sorting when 
a beefy, perspiring mover is standing over your shoulder demanding, "What's 
next, lady?" 
</P>
<P>
 For me, the only way to accomplish this repugnant but necessary task was to 
schedule time off from work to do it. It wasn't about being fanatical -- it was 
about gaining control of my life and the little things that cluttered it. 
</P>
<P>
 So, organizing books and videos in hand, I submerged myself into the expert 
advice of the potty-trained-too-early. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's what worked for me in my quest for a streamlined household. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Set a deadline. Most people thrive under a little stress. When I was an 
active realtor it amazed me how, before the listing date, clients could 
transform "Animal House" into an abode that could charm Donna Reed. It was the 
magic of the deadline at work. Or, maybe it was just that strangers would soon 
be peering into every closet, drawer and cabinet they owned. Another deadline 
you could set for yourself would be to schedule a garage sale -- and place an 
ad -- so your clutter can become someone else's problem. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Work within a time limit rather than worry about finishing each organizing 
project. Smaller areas you're likely to complete anyway, once you get into it. 
More daunting tasks -- my closet, for instance -- seemed less formidable since 
I could leave my work when the quitting bell rang. Just like Fred Flintstone. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Finish some projects each day if your organizing "fest" is continuing over 
several days. I kept going back to my orderly bathroom vanity for inspiration. 
Even if yours is a single project, divide a larger task into smaller, doable 
parts so you feel a sense of accomplishment. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Ignore (sometimes) the organizing experts. A lot of their advice is good, 
some is beyond reason. Example: Cancel all subscriptions. That's ridiculous -- 
I like to read and it's cheaper to subscribe. If you can't throw away a 
yellowed newspaper or a several-months-old magazine, then you have more 
problems than a how-to article can fix. 
</P>
<P>
 Or there's Stephanie Schur of Space Organizers who insists you replace all 
your hangers, even perfectly good plastic ones, with matching hangers so it 
looks less "cluttery." Oh puh-leez. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Invite a friend to help you. Disciplined pals only; anal retentive 
preferred. Offer to trade your help with something he or she needs to do. Just 
having company for some endeavors, like sorting the toy heap, made a huge 
difference. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Look on the bright side, organizing your house can be as much fun as 
shopping -- without spending any money! I found the watch I lost in December, 
new shoes I'd forgotten about, misplaced gift certificates (to Nordstrom, no 
less). I can now put off schlepping to Toys R Us for months since my kids are 
enjoying their newfound playthings -- with all their sundry parts reunited. 
</P>
<P>
 -- One of the most useful tips I found is a painless way to streamline my 
message-taking. Paulette Ensign of Organizing Solutions suggests you put a 
spiral notebook by your main phone. Place large sticky notes by all others. 
When you take a message, either write it directly in the book or use the note 
and stick it into the book ASAP. No more "Where's that @%*! phone number!" at 
my house. So simple it's sickening. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Kid stuff. The ubiquitous toy chest just doesn't work as a catchall, say 
Ronni Eisenberg and Kate Kelly, authors of "Organize Your Family" (Hyperion, 
1993). They're right. Little items sift to the bottom never to resurface again. 
</P>
<P>
 But chests are great for storing one category of things like dress-up clothes, 
blankets and so on. I moved ours to the back door and filled it with bulky, 
outdoor playthings like balls, bats, rackets, water pistols and sand toys. The 
rest of the toys are on sorted preschool style, each type of toy in neatly 
labeled bins. 
</P>
<P>
 The theme that was pounded into my head by the experts was to make sure the 
kids can reach all their belongings. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Don't be a yo-yo organizer. 
</P>
<P>
 Think about how much time you used to waste frantically searching for 
misplaced items. Now you can spend a few minutes each night or morning putting 
things away. Make this as important -- and routine -- as brushing your teeth. 
It's still my daily struggle: There may not be a 12-step program for me, but 
I'm recovering. 
</P>
<P>
 The best advice comes from my grandmother, Lorenza Santana: "Don't think about 
it, just do it." You can apply those words of wisdom to most of life's 
distasteful tasks. 
</P>
<P>
 Now I'm ready for a vacation.

YOUR MORTGAGE; FIGURING OUT NEGATIVE AMORTIZATION 
</P>

 What is negative amortization? 
</P>
<P>
 Negative amortization is an increase in the principal balance of a loan that 
occurs because the monthly payment is insufficient to pay the interest owed. 
</P>
<P>
 A conventional fixed-rate mortgage does not have the possibility of negative 
amortization because each monthly payment pays the entire amount of interest 
owed for that period. 
</P>
<P>
 Negative amortization is most often associated with adjustable rate mortgages 
(ARMs) that have a payment cap. A payment cap puts a limit on how much the 
monthly payment can rise or fall when it adjusts. Typically, a payment cap will 
be 7.5% of the previous payment amount. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, let's say that you have a $150,000 adjustable rate mortgage with 
a 7.5% payment cap and a current interest rate of 6%. Your current monthly 
payment is $900, which covers the entire interest owed. This payment will be in 
effect for one year at which time it will adjust if interest rates have 
changed. 
</P>
<P>
 During the year, suppose the interest rate on your loan increases to 7.5%. 
Without a payment cap, your monthly payment would jump to $1,048.50. But, since 
your loan has a payment cap, the maximum monthly payment the lender can require 
you to pay at the next adjustment will be $967.50. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though your payment is capped, you are not relieved of the responsibility 
for paying the additional interest due. Your payment is simply deferred. Any 
interest that's not paid when due is added to the remaining loan balance. When 
this happens, your loan balance increases rather than decreases each time you 
make a monthly payment. 
</P>
<P>
 Negative amortization can be particularly risky when property values are 
declining. In this case, you could end up with a loan balance that's higher 
than the market value of your property. 
</P>
<P>
 You might wonder why anyone would want a loan that has a payment cap. If 
interest rates shot up at the same time as you suffered an economic hardship, 
you might welcome a payment cap that would keep your expenses down until your 
financial picture improved. 
</P>
<P>
 ARMs with payment caps are usually re-amortized every five years or so or when 
the remaining balance increases to 125% of the original loan balance. At this 
point, your monthly payment is not protected by the 7.5% cap and could jump 
dramatically. 
</P>
<P>
 First-Time Tip: With recent interest rate increases on fixed-rate mortgages, 
many home buyers have turned to ARMs. While most ARMs don't have negative 
amortization as a feature, some of the most competitive ones do. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though an ARM has the possibility of negative amortization, you don't 
have to let this occur if you're diligent and disciplined. The lender gives you 
the option of making the "minimum payment due" based on your payment cap, or 
you can make a fully amortized payment that will pay the entire amount of 
interest due at that time. If you consistently make a fully amortized payment, 
you won't have negative amortization. 
</P>
<P>
 Be aware that many ARMs are offered at very low initial interest rate in 
effect for three months before the fully indexed rate goes into effect. If the 
ARM has a payment that's capped for the first year, you could get into negative 
amortization starting with the fourth month, unless you increase the amount you 
pay to cover the rate increase that will take effect when the teaser rate 
expires. 
</P>
<P>
 The Closing: Don't automatically exclude ARMs with negative amortization from 
consideration. Just make sure that you fully understand how the loan works and 
the ramifications of taking such a loan before deciding one way or another.

RENT WATCH: TIPS ON TODAY'S MORE SUBTLE DISCRIMINATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Special to The Times 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 QUESTION: My fiancee and I have a question about discrimination. We have been 
checking out rentals near our workplace because neither of our current 
apartments is big enough for a couple, and we plan to get married next month. 
We found an ideal complex with an available two bedroom apartment and were 
quoted a very attractive rent over the phone, so we made an appointment. The 
manager treated us cordially during our visit but the rent had mysteriously 
increased by $50 per month. Although we still qualified for the unit, we 
decided not to apply because it was over the range we had budgeted for housing. 
Since I am Latino and my fiancee is African-American, we wonder if 
discrimination might be involved. If so, what can be done about it? 
</P>
<P>
 ANSWER: Today, discrimination frequently takes a more subtle form than the old 
fashioned point blank refusal to show or rent an apartment. The higher rent 
quoted at the time of your visit may have been the result of an honest mistake 
or may indeed represent race or national origin discrimination. By quoting you 
a higher rent, the manager did discourage you from applying, and it is natural 
to wonder what his motives may have been. For assistance, contact the fair 
housing agency in your area. The agency will inform you of your rights under 
the law, conduct an investigation and assist you with referral to an attorney, 
or state or federal agency, if you choose. To locate an agency in Southern 
California, call (213) -- HOUSING. Law Changes Mobile Park Water Billing 
</P>
<P>
 Q: The manager of my mobile-home park recently told me that my water meter is 
connected to the sprinkler system that waters the flower bed at the entrance to 
the park. He said a newly amended law required him to disclose this. Shouldn't 
he have told me about this earlier, and shouldn't I be reimbursed for this 
added expense, since I pay the water bills? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Until Jan. 1, it was not necessary for park management to make this 
disclosure. But, since the first of this year, they must. (For law buffs, Civil 
Code Section 798.43 was so amended.) 
</P>
<P>
 Do they have to reimburse you? If they continue to use water charged to your 
meter for watering common areas, they are required to pay you for their use of 
the water. Their financial obligation extends back to Jan. 1, 1991, or back to 
the time that they discovered the situation; they are also required to enter 
into a written agreement with you regarding future compensation for the park's 
portion of the bill. 
</P>
<P>
 If management stopped using your meter as soon as they discovered this 
problem, or before the first of 1994 at the latest, you are not entitled to 
reimbursement. But talk it over with them; you have nothing to lose, and they 
may agree to some compensation. Your local mediation program may be able to 
assist you. Commissioner Asks About 'Accessible' Act 
</P>
<P>
 Q: As a member of a local planning commission, I received an application from 
a developer to build new multifamily rental property in our city. The developer 
is talking about making a few of the units accessible to the handicapped. What 
does the Fair Housing Law say on this subject? 
</P>
<P>
 A: According to the Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988 all "covered 
multifamily dwellings built for occupancy after March 31, 1991, shall be 
designed and constructed to have one building entrance on an accessible route . 
. . and be designed in such a manner that the public and common areas are 
accessible." Also, all the areas within the units must meet the accessibility 
requirements as outlined in the Federal Register. 
</P>
<P>
 As one who reviews the building design proposals, you need to make sure that 
all the units are accessible as long as it it practical to do so. The burden of 
establishing impracticality because of the terrain or unusual site 
characteristics is on the developer. If you have any additional questions, call 
your local fair housing agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban 
Development at (800) 347-3739. Local Ordinances Can't Overrule State Laws 
</P>
<P>
 Q: I own property in a city that recently proposed an ordinance requiring 
landlords to give a 60-day notice to change the terms of a tenancy. Is that 
legal? 
</P>
<P>
 A: No. In the Tri-County Apartment Assn. v. City of Mountain View (1987), the 
court found that state laws relating to tenant/landlord matters are preemptive 
-- that is they can't be changed or overridden by local ordinances. 
</P>
<P>
 Therefore, local rules cannot require more or less notice than is required by 
Civil Code Section 827, which requires only a 30-day notice to change the terms 
of a month-to-month tenancy.

CALIFORNIA FORECLOSURES UP 24% FROM A YEAR AGO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The number of real estate foreclosures in California is up by more than 24% in 
the first half of this year compared to the same period one year ago, according 
to TRW REDI Property Data, a real estate information company. 
</P>
<P>
 TRW REDI reports that lenders repossessed more than 36,000 properties between 
January and June with a combined mortgage value of $ 7.6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 While the foreclosure trend is still on the rise, TRW REDI's analyst, Nima 
Nattagh, notes that the rate of increase has slowed significantly. In the state 
as a whole, foreclosures jumped by 74% between 1992 and 1993 in the 
January-June period and 24% between 1993 and 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 TRW REDI's statistics also show that the southern metropolitan areas continue 
to fare worse than the other parts of the state. The Los Angeles-Anaheim 
metropolitan area now accounts for more than 80% of all foreclosures compared 
to less than half in 1989. In the San Francisco Bay Area and Sacramento Valley 
region foreclosures increased by 12% and 16% respectively in the first six 
months of 1994 from last year's level. Southland Foreclosures

BUYERS WOULD GET RADON RESULTS UNDER NEW BILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Home sellers would have to tell prospective buyers if the house has been 
tested for radon, and give them the results, under a measure passed last week 
by the House of Representatives. 
</P>
<P>
 Radon, a naturally occurring radioactive gas has been linked to cancer, and 
backers of the legislation said home buyers should be informed about the 
potential threat. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a health problem," said Rep. Henry Waxman, (D-Calif.), a key sponsor 
of the legislation. "Wouldn't most Americans want to know if there is a (radon) 
problem?" 
</P>
<P>
 The bill, approved 255-164, also would require the Environmental Protection 
Agency to identify areas where radon is found in high concentrations and 
develop mandatory certification for radon testing equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 The measure has yet to be taken up by the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 Radon, a colorless and odorless gas, is created naturally by the decay of 
uranium and radium in rocks and soil, and it has been found to cause lung 
cancer if inhaled in substantial amounts. 
</P>
<P>
 Generally, radon is not a problem in the open air, but high concentrations of 
trapped radon gas have been found in some homes and commercial buildings after 
seeping through building foundations. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Center for Disease Control has estimated that radon may cause 
between 7,000 and 30,000 additional cases of lung cancer annually, there are no 
federal or state laws that require people to take steps to mitigate exposure in 
homes and commercial buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 The House bill does not require mitigation or even testing either. But, 
critics of the bill said its disclosure requirements would essentially require 
sellers, in most cases, to conduct tests and correct the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a voluntary program," complained Rep. Michael Oxley (R-Ohio), who 
called the measure "an unwarranted burden on the homeowner." An attempt by 
Oxley to strip the legislation of its real estate disclosure requirements 
failed 193-227. 
</P>
<P>
 Oxley said radon-testing requirements should be handled locally because the 
gas "is not a problem uniformly across the country" and that there has been no 
evidence of a health concern at low concentrations. 
</P>
<P>
 Waxman said that the aim is to provide home purchasers with information about 
radon just as they currently must be told about the presence and potential 
hazard of lead paint. He said tests cost about $30 and mitigation, which 
usually consists of venting air from basements and foundation areas, also 
usually are not very costly. 
</P>
<P>
 The legislation requires that anyone selling or renting residential or 
commercial properties must provide to potential buyers a pamphlet explaining 
the possible hazards of radon and make known the results of any tests that have 
been conducted. 
</P>
<P>
 Failure to comply could expose the seller to a civil fine of $2,000, but no 
criminal penalties. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill also would require that: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The EPA, within nine months, identify regions of the country that have 
"exceptionally" high radon levels and develop a strategy for reducing those 
levels. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Radon testing devices and remediation services meet EPA performance and 
certification standards. EPA certification is now voluntary. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The EPA develop building standards and techniques that can be used to 
reduce the radon threat.

SPEAKING OUT: SAGA OF A COTTAGE: RENTERS HAVE WAR STORIES TOO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HARALD JOHNSON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When the honey started dripping on our dinner guests' heads, I knew we had a 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Before my wife and I had moved into our hillside rental house in Woodland 
Hills, the owner had mentioned that an occasional drop of honey might find its 
way from a dried-up beehive somewhere in the walls and out the ceiling fan vent 
of the guest bathroom. 
</P>
<P>
 But we weren't prepared for the constant flow of the sticky brown stuff for 
the next three years while we lived in the house. It was right out of a horror 
movie: The honey dripped on the toilet, on the floor, on our dog and on our 
guests, from whom our embarrassment was hard to hide. 
</P>
<P>
 The landlord made one attempt at finding the ancient beehive, but after having 
an entire wall in the bathroom ripped out and living with the mess for one 
week, no hive was found, and she suggested we learn to cope with the honey 
since she couldn't tear down the whole house looking for its source. After all, 
it was only a rental. 
</P>
<P>
 I have been a renter for all of my adult years, and while I know that owners 
love to trade war stories about destructive tenants, I have my own tales of 
horror, told from the renter's perspective, that can match the best that any 
landlord can tell. 
</P>
<P>
 The saga at our Woodland Hills house -- a charming, country-style cottage 
nestled in a fold of the Santa Monica Mountains -- continues. 
</P>
<P>
 At the beginning, we didn't mind the owner -- a schoolteacher who seemed to 
have plenty of time on her hands -- stopping by to putter in the garden or to 
see if there were any problems with the house. But the frequent and unannounced 
visits started to get on our nerves when they continued well after we had 
settled in. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday mornings were a traditionally peaceful -- and sometimes romantic -- 
time for the two of us, but we now seemed to be sharing them with our landlady, 
who ostensibly needed to check on the watering system -- the automatic watering 
system. 
</P>
<P>
 Then came the workmen. It was a 60-year-old house, so things admittedly needed 
fixing, but the work never seemed to end. Plumbers would arrive to fix leaks. 
Carpenters had to repair crumbling stairs. Electricians needed to fix faulty 
wiring. Exterminators needed to get to the attic with the only access through 
my wife's bedroom closet. 
</P>
<P>
 The landlord was sometimes -- but not always -- willing to meet with the 
workers herself or, by making them her agents, give them the keys, but after 
thinking about the potential security problems and finding my wife's antiques 
scratched after workmen had set their tools on them, we decided that we would 
have to make ourselves available to supervise any worker visits. 
</P>
<P>
 Access to the house for needed repairs is part of any lease, but after my wife 
had cleared out her closet 75 times and when the number of worker-supervision 
days hit 108, I said enough. We were renting the house for our use, not to be 
general contractors. 
</P>
<P>
 Then came another problem. Since these were the days of the region's drought 
and mandatory water rationing, we became concerned when the automatic 
sprinklers kept sputtering through the night and at frequent intervals. We 
wanted to have some influence over the watering, especially since the 
Department of Water and Power bill was in our name. 
</P>
<P>
 The system's controls were housed in a padlocked box, but the landlord agreed 
to give us the combination after my third call in the middle of a winter 
downpour to come turn off the system that was spewing water from the sprinkler 
heads and dollars from my pockets. 
</P>
<P>
 Then one day, the lock combination was changed. It only seemed like a petty 
power play in retaliation for our digging in our heels over the repairmen, but 
during the Malibu wildfires, when our neighbors were frantically hosing down 
their roofs and sprinkling their properties, we had no access to the watering 
system. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was the rats that finally pushed us over the edge. We started hearing 
the telltale gnawing and scratching inside the walls, and when we had to remove 
a water-damaged piece of the kitchen ceiling, six inches of rat feces fell on 
us and our kitchen counter. 
</P>
<P>
 The pest control companies that the owner had on contract did their best, but 
they never seemed to be able to completely eliminate the problem. The stench 
that the rotting rodent carcasses created every few months kept us awake at 
night and caused us to cancel more than one dinner party. A friend suggested 
placing bowls of vinegar throughout the house, but they were no match for the 
horrible smell. 
</P>
<P>
 When we noticed that the pest companies kept changing, one finally confided in 
us that the owner simply wasn't paying enough to get rid of the rats once and 
for all, and they would end up resigning the account out of frustration. We 
learned that they were only being contracted to set traps; no one was keeping 
the rats from getting into the house in the first place through the huge holes 
and gaps in the foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 After several frantic calls for help, the exasperated landlord asked us to 
"just consider it a country living experience." Since I was paying her $18,000 
a year in rent, and the urine from the rats was now seeping through the kitchen 
cabinets and onto our plates, I wasn't very receptive to this line of 
reasoning. 
</P>
<P>
 We finally took a more affirmative approach: We called the city health 
inspector. She came out, took one look at the house and told the owner in no 
uncertain terms to fix the problem or else. The rats were gone within two 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 But soon, so were we. After the Jan. 17 temblor hit, and facing weeks of 
earthquake repairs, we decided that we had had enough and gave our 30-day 
notice at the end of the lease period. 
</P>
<P>
 After a lengthy security deposit refund dispute that included a $1.50 charge 
from the landlord for a missing light bulb, we recently settled into a new 
house and are actively saving up to buy something of our own so we can stop 
collecting rental war stories.

GARDENING; WHAT IS PREFERRED TIME OF DAY TO WATER PLANTS? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK E. CHRISTENSEN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 QUESTION: I've always heard that watering camellias and other large-leaf 
plants during the heat of the day will burn the foliage. Is this really true? 
Is there a preferred time of day for watering the plants in my yard? 
</P>
<P>
 ANSWER: According to George Pinyuh, a Washington State University Extension 
agent, research counters this time-honored but misinformed notion. In fact, he 
points out, the water would have to be about six inches deep on a leaf to burn 
the foliage. Even so, remember that watering during the heat of the day wastes 
water, since much of it turns to vapor and escapes into the air. 
</P>
<P>
 With regard to timing, generally plants should be watered early in the 
morning, for two main reasons: to save water and to help control plant 
diseases. 
</P>
<P>
 If you have an automatic watering system, it is ideal to set the clock so all 
stations operate between 2 a.m. and 7 a.m. Even rose foliage sprinkled at this 
time of day will usually have much less trouble with powdery mildew, if the 
plants are situated in a well-ventilated area in full sunlight. That's because 
this early watering encourages the fungus spores to germinate, and daytime 
conditions destroy them. Evening watering, on the other hand, gives disease 
organisms time to develop protection against the light and dryness of the day 
and actually promotes their growth. 
</P>
<P>
 Wind and evaporation waste a surprising amount of water that runs through 
sprinklers on hot or breezy days. But in the normal calm and cool of early 
morning, most of the water soaks into the soil. 
</P>
<P>
 This having been said, bear in mind that new lawns and other new plantings 
require extra attention to watering for a while, especially on hot or windy 
days. But for established plantings, morning watering is definitely preferred. 
Benefits of Using Mulch in Gardens 
</P>
<P>
 Q: I've been told that it is good to put one inch of mulch around plants in my 
garden. Does mulching really help? If so, what kind should I use? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Mulching really does help. It conserves moisture, retards weeds and 
promotes plant growth. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten or 15 years ago a major university studied the effects of mulches on 
permanent plantings. They reported that a 3- to 4-inch depth of any organic 
matter around plants would significantly increase their growth and flowering 
while reducing the amount of watering needed. Interestingly enough, they 
concluded that gardeners should use whatever organic mulch is readily available 
to them at the lowest cost, and it works. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, the large public rose garden in Hershey, Pa., is heavily mulched 
with (what else?) cocoa hulls, which are plentiful there and which fill the air 
with a wonderful rich chocolate aroma. In a Seattle public garden the workers 
mulch with an ever-ready supply of elephant manure from the neighboring zoo; 
they call it "zoo-doo," and surprisingly (fortunately) it has no noticeable 
aroma. 
</P>
<P>
 Around here I have seen successful mulches of wood shavings, aged steer manure 
(but this smells for a while), rice hulls and even almond hulls, when they can 
be found. Be aware that you will also need to feed your plants regularly when 
you mulch them; and then stand back and enjoy their growth. Getting Fruit Trees 
to Bear Annually 
</P>
<P>
 Q: We have a plum tree that fruited well for the first time this year. What 
can we do to ensure a good annual crop? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Many fruit trees tend to bear heavily, then lightly, in alternate years. 
This tendency can be controlled somewhat by (1) proper winter pruning, (2) 
feeding just before flowers appear in spring and (3) thinning the fruit when 
it's about half-an-inch long. Weather factors during the winter and at blossom 
time also affect fruiting, but these we cannot control. So we do what we can, 
and then let nature take her course. Good Luck. Treating Chlorosis in Geraldton 
Waxflowers 
</P>
<P>
 Q: I have two large Geraldton Waxflower plants (Chamelaucium uncinatum) about 
3 years old. These have grown very well and bloom profusely, but there is a 
problem. Much of the foliage is yellow, which I assume is chlorosis, but it 
does not respond to treatment with iron chelate or other things I've tried. 
What do you suggest? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Geraldton Waxflowers -- which have needle-like leaves and produce 
long-lasting, wax-like pinkish flowers in winter -- are native to parts of 
Australia with dry, quick-draining, rather alkaline soils and bright sunlight. 
They will not tolerate any acidity around their roots, and they will sulk and 
decline if they receive more water than they "want." 
</P>
<P>
 Chlorosis is the unhealthy yellowing of newer leaves, usually with darker 
green veins showing. Although the chlorosis you describe may be related to a 
slightly acid soil condition, it is more likely, since your plants are still 
alive and growing, that the plants simply get more water than they can 
tolerate. Geraldton Waxflowers thrive on neglect when planted in rapid-draining 
soil and watered deeply but infrequently. Brown Flecks on Fruit Is Sign of 
Sweetness 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Some of the fruits on my apple and nectarine trees have brownish flecks or 
streaks on the skin, while others are pretty and uniformly colored. What causes 
this, and what can I do to get rid of it? 
</P>
<P>
 A: What you describe sounds to me like "russetting," which is a thin, 
sort-of-corky layer of cells on the skin of certain fruits, usually more 
pronounced on the "shoulders" or near the stem-end of the fruit. Pippin apples 
are famous for their heavy russetting. 
</P>
<P>
 This kind of russetting usually forms on susceptible fruits developing in 
direct sunlight. Thus, these fruits tend to be sweeter than the prettier, more 
uniformly colored ones. There is really nothing you can do to eliminate the 
russetting; but you might take note that these "ugly ducklings" are usually the 
sweetest fruits on your trees.

HANDYMAN Q&A: WASHING MACHINE IS DANCING ACROSS FLOOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By POPULAR MECHANICS, FOR AP SPECIAL FEATURES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 QUESTION: I replaced a washing machine because it vibrated and danced across 
the floor. It seemed nothing could stop this. I bought a new washer and the 
same thing is happening. An appliance service technician said it was the floor. 
I bought two jacks and braced the beams under the washer, but it still vibrates 
and moves. What is the solution? 
</P>
<P>
 ANSWER: We suggest you put a piece of three-fourths inch plywood under the 
washer. Cut the wood so it extends away from the washer on all sides, and 
position the washer in the plywood's center. You don't need to secure the 
plywood to the floor with nails or screws. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, check the machine to be sure it is level from side to side and front to 
back. Adjust the leveling legs so the machine is as close to the floor as 
possible, and be sure that the locking nuts on the leveling legs are locked 
down. This should prevent your washer from doing the two-step. Why Does Faucet 
Leak Keep Coming Back? 
</P>
<P>
 Q: My bathroom sink has had a leaky faucet for some time. I've replaced the 
faucet washer several times, and this seems to help for a while, but the 
dripping always comes back. What is causing this problem? 
</P>
<P>
 A: When a defective faucet washer is allowed to leak for an extended period of 
time, the pressure of the water will cut a channel in the faucet seat. For this 
reason, always repair a leaking faucet immediately. A defective seat will chew 
up new washers in short order. Always check the faucet seat when you replace a 
washer. 
</P>
<P>
 If you find a channel in the surface of a seat, replace the seat. A seat 
wrench will allow you to unscrew a removable seat from the faucet body. 
</P>
<P>
 Some seats are machined into the brass body of a faucet and therefore cannot 
be removed. If your faucet seats are pitted and cannot be replaced, your only 
alternative is to grind the entire seat rim to a level below the surface of the 
pit. While this may sound difficult, it is not. You can buy an inexpensive seat 
grinder from your local hardware dealer, and once the faucet is apart, you can 
complete the job in a matter of minutes.

GARDENING; EXTENDING THE LIFE OF GARDEN HOSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By READER'S DIGEST BOOKS, AP SPECIAL FEATURES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With simple care and easy repairs, your garden hose will last a long time. 
</P>
<P>
 Here are some tips: 
</P>
<P>
 -- To keep your garden hose unsnarled and easy to transport, use a reel on 
wheels. Store it in the garage or shed. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Never hang a hose on a nail, which can crease it. Buy a wall rack or mount 
an old auto tire rim on the wall to serve as a rack. Straighten out kinks and 
creases as soon as you discover them. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Don't leave a hose lying on the ground between jobs. Drain it and, unless 
it's on a reel or wall mount, coil it flat on the floor after each use. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Keep the hose in a cool, dry place where it won't be damaged by a car, lawn 
mower, or excessive sunlight. The sun's ultraviolet rays cause vinyl to 
deteriorate. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Don't allow water to freeze in a hose. Bring it indoors for the winter. But 
don't store it in a room where electric motors operate -- they produce ozone 
which attacks rubber. 
</P>
<P>
 If a hose has several leaks, it has probably deteriorated so badly that it 
really isn't worth fixing. But a single leak is easy to fix, either temporarily 
or permanently. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's how to repair a garden hose: Temporary fixes 
</P>
<P>
 -- Clean and dry the hose. Temporarily plug a pinhole leak by jamming a round 
wooden toothpick into the hole. Snap the toothpick off flush with the hose's 
outer skin. As the wood absorbs water, it will swell to seal the hole. Then 
wrap the hole with plastic electrician's tape 2 inches on each side of the 
leak. Overlap and stretch the tape as you apply it, except for the first lap 
and last three or four turns of the tape so the hose will bend. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Also try to seal pin-sized holes by touching them carefully with the 
glowing point of a heated ice pick. Long-term repair 
</P>
<P>
 -- To make a more permanent repair to a hose, make straight cuts on either 
side of the leak with a sharp utility knife. Take the segment of hose to a 
hardware store or garden center and select a hose mender kit whose insert 
sections match the inner diameter of the hose. The fit should be snug but not 
so tight as to crack the hose. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Use a crimp-type mender to fix a rubber hose. Insert one end of the mender 
into a hose end until it seats well. Wet the hose if the tube is a tight fit. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Place the end of the hose on a metal anvil or wooden block and hammer down 
the prongs of the mender gently and gradually until they grip the hose tightly 
all around. Repeat this procedure on the second piece of hose. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Use a threaded sleeve mender to fix a plastic hose. Dip the hose ends into 
hot water to soften them. Insert a threaded sleeve into the end of the hose. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Push the coupling over the hose end until the hose seats against the 
shoulder inside the coupling. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Push the special key (included in the kit) into the notches inside the 
sleeve. Turn the key clockwise until the top of the sleeve is flush with the 
end of the hose. Repeat with the second piece of hose. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Screw the couplings together to complete the repair.

CUT YOUR UTILITY BILLS: PROTECTING HOME FROM SUN'S DAMAGING RAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES DULLEY, Dulley is a Cincinnati-based engineering consultant. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 QUESTION: The summer sun bakes me through my windows and skylight and fades my 
furniture. How can I inexpensively block the sun's direct heat, yet see clearly 
outdoors and still get free solar heat in the winter? 
</P>
<P>
 ANSWER: Blocking the sun's intensity through your windows can lower your 
air-conditioning costs significantly. In addition to blocking heat and glare, 
you must block the sun's invisible fading rays. These ultraviolet (UV) fading 
rays also slowly break down the fabrics and cause premature wear. 
</P>
<P>
 There are several inexpensive do-it-yourself summer-only methods to reduce the 
intensity of the sun through your windows without obstructing the view. These 
sun control methods are designed to be easily removed each winter to let free 
solar heat in through your windows. 
</P>
<P>
 I use a reusable summer-only self-cling film on several of my own south- and 
west-facing windows. It is available in lightly tinted gray or bronze, and you 
can reapply it year after year. It is available in rolls or in do-it-yourself 
kits that include the film, knife and squeegee for installing it. 
</P>
<P>
 This window film is made of self-cling vinyl. The vinyl creates a natural 
static charge that makes it adhere tightly to your window glass. There is no 
permanent adhesive. It blocks 55% of the sun's heat and most of the fading 
rays, yet still provides an undistorted view outdoors. 
</P>
<P>
 To install it, spray the window with water so the film slides easily. Lay the 
film against the window, cut it to size and squeegee away the excess water. In 
the winter, you just pull one corner loose and peel it off. Roll it onto a 
paper tube or fold it up until next summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Another option is see-through roll-up interior shades that block heat and stop 
fading. One type uses a durable tinted Mylar film that blocks 96% of the UV 
fading rays. It is mounted on a spring- or pull-chain roller. 
</P>
<P>
 Sun-control fiberglass screening can also be used for the roll-up shade. It 
blocks 50% to 70% of the sun's heat depending on the weave and color. The most 
effective new shade is aluminum foil embedded in tough fabric. It blocks all 
the fading rays and much heat, but you cannot see through it. 
</P>
<P>
 For a skylight, you can install a removable interior fiberglass screen shade. 
You attach narrow channels on either end of your skylight. Wrap the screen ends 
around the rods and snap them into the channels. There are also exterior 
skylight screen covers that attach with elastic bungie cords. 
</P>
<P>
 Write to me for Utility Bills Update No. 999 listing manufacturers of reusable 
self-cling window film (and a small sample piece to try), roll-up film and 
screen window and skylight shades, prices, specifications and installation 
instructions. Please include $2 and a self-addressed envelope. Does Dripping 
Faucet Warrant Plumber Cost? 
</P>
<P>
 Q: My bathroom faucet drips, and I wondered if the water saved by fixing it is 
worth the expense of calling the plumber. About how much water does a dripping 
faucet waste? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I opened a bathroom faucet a little in my own home to measure the amount of 
water wasted. The faucet dripped eight times per minute. Over six hours, it 
dripped a pint of water. This is equivalent to 182 gallons per year. 
</P>
<P>
 You should have the drip fixed. Although the amount of water wasted from your 
one faucet is not great, the total water wasted from many homes across the 
country is significant. Also it may be hot water, which wastes energy too. A 
slow hot water drip feels cold by the time it gets to the faucet.

DEFENSE LAWYERS AND TRUTH: JUST WHERE DO THEY MEET? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Susan Estrich, Susan Estrich, a contributing editor to Opinion, is a law 
professor at USC. She served as campaign manager for Michael S. Dukakis in 
1988. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Look around the courtroom in a criminal trial and almost everyone is bound by 
one oath or another to tell the truth: the witnesses, of course; the jury and 
the judge, bound to find the truth; the prosecutor, whose lying can lead to 
reversal in the appeals court and at the polls; even members of the press, who 
can be sued for libel. The one person not pledged to tell the truth, seek the 
truth, let alone be bound by it, is the defense attorney.  
</P>
<P>
 For me, the only question that matters in the O.J. Simpson case is whether he 
did it. Everything turns on that. For Robert L. Shapiro and Johnnie L. Cochran 
Jr., Simpson's lawyers, nothing turns on it. Their job is to get Simpson off, 
innocent or guilty. If he's innocent, that means advocating the truth. If he's 
guilty, it means attacking it. 
</P>
<P>
 Criminal defense lawyers are not supposed to put witnesses on the stand who 
they know will commit perjury; of course, many criminal defense lawyers claim 
they're incapable of ever really knowing anything. They can't hide the murder 
weapon in their desk drawers, though they're not obligated to pick it up. Other 
than that, they're pretty free to obstruct the search for truth in any way they 
can, within the rules of evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses are fair game -- even if they're telling the truth. So is every 
piece of evidence, and every scientific test, even if it was accurately 
performed. You can impeach the person who found the evidence, question whether 
it was securely maintained, debate the accuracy of the test, undermine the 
reliability of the lab -- even if you know, all the time, that the witness is 
telling the truth about where he found the evidence, it is your client's hat 
and the test turned up the right answer. You have an absolute right to libel 
anyone in the courtroom; Det. Mark Fuhrman's suit against the Simpson legal 
team is premised on what they said outside of court, in the public "trial." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, in most criminal cases, these are just theoretical possibilities. 
Most defendants are lucky if their lawyer has time to investigate possible true 
defenses, much less mount false ones. Most defendants can't afford their own 
investigators and scientists and forensic experts and criminalists. Most 
defendants can't afford a million-dollar defense. There's a real question if 
they even get an adequate one. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson's life and liberty are on the line. He has a right to spend whatever 
he has on his defense. The question is: What can it buy him? Simpson is 
presumed innocent. He may indeed be innocent. I hope he is. But some of those 
who can afford a million-dollar defense are guilty in fact. Should it matter? 
Does a million dollars, under the current rules, with a smart lawyer and a 
well-selected jury, buy you a reasonable doubt? 
</P>
<P>
 The explanation academics offer for the "different mission" of criminal 
lawyers that allows them such latitude with the truth is the adversary system 
of justice. The way we find truth, and protect the innocent, in an adversary 
system of justice is by putting the government to its proof, by arguing each 
point, each fact. 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly, no one questions the right of an attorney to attack the credibility 
of witnesses who are lying, or attack the validity of tests he believes are 
inaccurate. No one doubts his right to argue to the jury that lies are lies, or 
that facts are true. No one, in short, is seeking to limit the advocacy of an 
attorney attacking a prosecution case that is untrue and defending an innocent 
man. 
</P>
<P>
 The harder question is why he is allowed to do these things when their purpose 
is to obfuscate the truth, to create doubt -- and he knows that, or would if he 
allowed himself to "know" anything. Does every man deserve a defense, even if 
the only ones available are false defenses? How does it make truth-finding 
better when a lawyer undermines a truthful witness? If the rape victim is 
telling the truth, do you get to destroy her anyway? How does it help the jury 
do its job if you tell them that in is out or up is down or lies are truth. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor is it an answer that defense lawyers can't "know" anything, that they're 
not truth finders, and shouldn't be. That's the answer you most often hear from 
practicing lawyers about why any system limiting their advocacy makes no sense. 
But the ethics codes all reject that: It's well-established that a defense 
lawyer can't put a witness on the stand if he knows that witness will commit 
perjury -- a line that turns precisely on a lawyer's ability to know the 
difference between truth and lies. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't ask, don't tell" may be the posture lawyers take about their client's 
guilt; but the same lawyers who try to persuade you, for ethical purposes, that 
they know nothing will turn around and brag they never try a case unless they 
know everything, and they can tell when someone is lying. Proving and 
disproving facts, persuading jurors of truth or falsity, is what lawyers do. We 
have a whole system of rules for doing it. It doesn't follow that lawyers are 
incapable of applying those rules for themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, there's the question of a defendant's right. When the power of the 
state is arrayed against you, and your liberty is on the line, do you have a 
right to have someone on your side who will fight for you, argue for you, even 
twist facts, distort evidence and attack the truth for you? What are the limits 
on a lawyer's role as secular confessor? 
</P>
<P>
 There's no question what defendants want. Every defendant wants a lawyer who 
will go to the wall -- and over it -- for him. That's what they mean when they 
talk about getting a "good" lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
 It's also what most good lawyers want to do. It serves their client's 
interest. It is part of being a "gladiator." It is sometimes the only way they 
can win. It does not necessarily serve the public interest. 
</P>
<P>
 These are not just questions for lawyers to resolve in codes of ethics. More 
is at stake than just the relationship between a lawyer and his client. This is 
also about how the criminal-justice system works. It is certainly bound to come 
up as Americans everywhere tune in for their next installment of Criminal 
Justice 101.

U.S. REGARDS ARISTIDE AS HAITI'S REAL PROBLEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Amy Wilentz, Amy Wilentz is the author of The Rainy Season: Haiti Since 
Duvalier (Simon & Schuster). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On the night of Sept. 28, 1991, came a moment that has determined the sorry 
course of U.S. policy toward Haiti for the past three years. It was not the 
moment when Haitian army men surrounded the presidential palace and forced 
elected president Jean-Bertrand Aristide into military custody. Nor was it the 
moment, hours later, when Aristide was hustled out of the country at the 
airport (formerly Francois Duvalier International Airport) with a 
pat-on-the-back goodby from the U.S. ambassador. The decisive moment for U.S. 
policy came when the military men holding Aristide failed to kill him, for 
whatever reason. 
</P>
<P>
 How they all must look back with regret on those moments when they had him in 
their hands and let him slip away. How the Americans must bemoan the judgment 
they made that Aristide must be spared. (After all, they must think to 
themselves, a man as mild as Salvador Allende died in the coup that overthrew 
his government in Chile, so why not the wild-eyed Aristide?) How the Haitian 
military must be kicking itself. 
</P>
<P>
 For it is Aristide and all that he embodies for the Haitian people in the form 
of one not particularly majestic man -- he embodies the dignity of the peasant 
and the slum dweller; he is the result of Haiti's only real election, and, as a 
symbol of democracy, he stands for equality among Haitians; he represents the 
right of average Haitians to a better life -- that has stood in the way of an 
easy solution to the Haitian crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the night Aristide did not die, the Americans have been wrestling with a 
dilemma. They want to end the crisis (and so stop the flow of refugees), but 
they don't want to reinstate Aristide. As far as the U.S. foreign-policy 
Establishment is concerned, he is the sworn enemy of America, a rabid leftist, 
a nationalizing, communizing, socializing revolutionary and, more than that, 
the least likely person in history that they would agree to go to war for. 
</P>
<P>
 So why are we considering going to war to reinstate Aristide? 
</P>
<P>
 Because Aristide is a necessary part of the solution -- both in Haiti and in 
terms of the international debate. In the end, only as a small part of a huge 
military project has the Clinton Administration been able to make Aristide's 
reinstatement palatable to the U.S. foreign-policy Establishment and the 
Haitian elite. Precisely because of all that Aristide represents to the Haitian 
people, no one (except the 67% who voted for him) wants him back. This is why 
the Haitian generals have felt secure in not budging an inch for a negotiated 
settlement. They understood that the United States was in no way committed to a 
diplomatic solution, because such a solution would provide no excuse for the 
kind of control mechanisms the Haitian elite and its U.S. friends want to 
impose on any Aristide administration. 
</P>
<P>
 It is widely feared among U.S. policy-makers that a returned Aristide, even 
surrounded by a "security" force of, say 250 U.N. peacekeepers, would be 
uncontrollable. It is pretty much clear that Aristide, no matter how hard he 
tried, would have difficulty curbing the understandable anger of his 
compatriots, which would manifest itself -- as usual in Haiti with almost every 
transfer of power, except when Aristide was elected -- in a purge of the thugs 
in the falling regime. Moreover, such a purge might lead not only to death and 
destruction of property but might signal actual change in the Haitian status 
quo -- change that Aristide was trying to bring about by peaceful means -- and 
that is intolerable to those who have been guiding U.S. Haiti policy. 
</P>
<P>
 Let's be clear about the uses of the next intervention in Haiti. The future 
U.S.-led intervention force of 15,000 troops -- to which the United Nations has 
given its stamp of approval -- is a battalion that will initially be used to 
oust Raoul Cedras, Michel-Joseph Francois and a number of other U.S.-trained 
military yobs who've been running the shambling "government" for the past few 
years. This is a job that would really take, at most, 200 rapid-deployment 
types. 
</P>
<P>
 The 15,000 brave young men and women are for controlling the streets after the 
generals have been dumped. They are for policing Aristide's constituency and 
who knows for how long. Until the United Nations can get its act together and 
set up a U.N. occupation as agreed to in the U.N. accord. That could take a 
year. By then, Aristide's term will be up. (Seven months in power, three years 
in exile and one year in office, while 15,000 foreign troops patrol his 
streets.) Then new elections will be scheduled, which the United Nations can 
supervise. The United States perhaps will have achieved its policy goal: 
Aristide's term will have ended without his once wielding true power. (Mindful 
of past presidents-for-life, the 1987 Haitian constitution forbids a president 
from successive terms.) 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Aristide has given more than tacit support for this putative intervention: 
He provided a letter (demanded by the U.N. Security Council before they would 
agree to the plan) asking for action by the international community. One must 
assume he has been forced into this because he has come to believe that 
intervention is the only way he is going back to Haiti, and that his return is 
symbolically essential for the reinstatement of democracy. 
</P>
<P>
 For those who know how the United States has behaved in Haiti over the past 10 
years, to say nothing of the past century, this is not enough to justify a U.S. 
intervention. The United States has not given one indication since the fall of 
Jean-Claude (Baby Doc) Duvalier in 1986 that it supports anything but the most 
cosmetic form of democracy in Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 A U.S. intervention would mean another half century of the same for Haiti: 
continuing domination by the economic elite; continuing penury for the Haitian 
peasantry (at least 50% of the population), and a complete halt to the organic 
internal change that is the prerequisite of any real democracy. The United 
States and its Haitian friends, after all, are the oppressors the Haitians were 
trying to throw off when they elected Aristide. A revolutionary cannot be 
considered successful if he is restored to power by the very order he sought to 
overthrow. 
</P>
<P>
 If the United States were acting in good faith, there are things that could 
still be done to bring about a peaceful solution to Haiti's long travail. The 
Americans could continue to impose a further strengthened embargo -- putting 
pressure on the Dominican Republic to close its still leaky border. Since the 
beginning of the crisis, the embargo is the one thing that has really bothered 
the Haitian elite. The harder it gets, the more they hate it, and the more it 
turns them away from the military men they put into power. 
</P>
<P>
 If the business elite unites against the military junta, the junta will go -- 
maybe not tomorrow, but soon. Then the United States would have to stand firm 
-- not President Bill Clinton's forte -- and keep the embargo in place until it 
is made clear to the elite that they will have to accept Aristide's return. And 
they would accept it -- in exchange for lifting the embargo. According to the 
Governors Island accords of a year ago, Aristide could then return, accompanied 
by some kind of international force that would at least respond to some of the 
elite's qualms about him. Of course, their worries would also be calmed by the 
fact that he would have only a short time left in his term. 
</P>
<P>
 All this could have been done a year ago, if Washington had been serious about 
democracy in Haiti. Unless they are willing to wait until Aristide's term is 
over before fixing things -- always a possibility -- the Americans seem to have 
boxed themselves into a corner where military intervention is the only 
alternative. Sadly, that's how the U.S. foreign-policy Establishment seems to 
want it.

NIGERIA HEADS TOWARD CIVIL WAR, AND THE WORLD LOOKS ELSEWHERE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Endowment for International Peace and the former director of African affairs 
for the House of Representatives.

<P>
 Nigeria's most precious commodity -- oil -- is once again the focal point of 
increased international attention to the country's promise and problems. 
Coupled with the military govern ment's retreat from democracy, strikes by 
Nigeria's oil workers have hiked the global price of oil, crippled the Nigerian 
economy and brought the country to a virtual standstill. Unless the 
dictatorship of Gen. Sani Abacha relinquishes its political and economic 
chokehold, releases President-elect Moshood K.O. Abiola from jail and 
reinstates the duly elected government, Nigeria will sink into civil war. 
</P>
<P>
 In a heralded effort to break from its legacy of military intervention in 
state affairs, Nigeria embarked on its latest sojourn to democracy in 1986, 
when Gen. Ibrahim Babangida announced he would voluntarily give up the 
presidency as part of a national program of democratic reform. In an 
unprecedented show of confidence, the general who had seized power in 1985 
spent millions on a public-relations campaign in the United States aimed at 
convincing U.S. policy-makers that his program for reform was viable. 
</P>
<P>
 Babangida took much longer than promised to deliver. But after a confusing 
series of party congresses and qualifying primaries, he allowed the first 
national elections for president in a decade to go forward, setting June 12, 
1993, as election day. More than 15 million Nigerians cast ballots, and the 
winner was Abiola, a wealthy -- as in billionaire -- industrialist. 
</P>
<P>
 Given Nigeria's ethnic, religious and regional divisions, Abiola's ability to 
unify the increasingly fractious country underscored his victory and signaled a 
new republic in the making. But before he could take office, Babangida's 
National Defense and Security Council intervened and "annulled" the voting 
results. After a brief reimposition of military rule, Babangida, ever 
protective of his international reputation, stepped down in August, 1993, but 
not before installing an interim government headed by Ernest Shonekan, a 
politician whose puppet strings were pulled by Abacha. 
</P>
<P>
 Shonekan's government quickly proved to be incapable of governing. One of his 
last acts of state, reportedly at Abacha's direction, was to increase fuel 
prices sevenfold, sparking feverish demonstrations by oil workers and 
pro-democracy groups. Given the military's de facto hold on power, it was only 
a matter of time before Abacha seized de jure control of the government. 
</P>
<P>
 In November, 1993, Abacha did just that, embarking upon a heavy-handed program 
of centralized control. Progress toward democracy was halted. Political and 
ethnic polarities resurfaced. The Nigerian economy plummeted to subterranean 
levels, with unemployment rising from 28% to 72%. And the extent of social 
dislocation is captured by the statistic that robbery or murder, particularly 
in Lagos, the capital, occurs at a rate of one incident every 40 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Abacha's fatal coup de grace , however, may well have been the unwarranted 
jailing of Abiola on charges of treason. Calculated to take the steam out of 
the pro-democracy movement, the arrest has produced the opposite effect. A once 
fractious group of pro-democracy activists has focused worldwide attention on 
Abacha's repressive regime. Since the arrest, rioting has become more 
widespread and violent, with the death toll rising. Pro-democracy activists, 
unionists, students and oil workers vow to continue their demonstrations until 
Abiola is released. Attaching conditions, as a judge did last week, to Abiola's 
release that would, in effect, maintain his political silence will not work. 
Abiola refused to comply with the order. 
</P>
<P>
 To its credit, the Clinton Administration has maintained an arms-length 
relationship with Nigeria. After the Abacha regime proved its propensity for 
brutality, Washington suspended foreign assistance and barred Nigerian 
officials from traveling to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Congress, meanwhile, has been less certain about what to do. Many members, 
including some in the Black Caucus, have not focused on Nigeria. One possible 
explanation is the extraordinary sums of money being spent by the Nigerian 
dictator on high-priced lobbyists in Washington. According to Justice 
Department records, the government of Nigeria spent close to $5 million over a 
24-month period for lobbying, government relations and public relations. All 
this from a country that has trouble paying its basic bank bills. 
</P>
<P>
 Nigeria's political and economic stability is -- or should be -- squarely on 
our national-interest agenda. Although the country has been shielded from 
extensive coverage by other world events, the crisis in Nigeria looms as large 
and important as any issue facing the African continent, including the war in 
Angola and the devastation in Rwanda. Nigeria, it should be remembered, is 
America's third-largest supplier of crude oil. The military dictatorship relies 
almost exclusively on petroleum revenues to maintain its illegal occupation of 
the government. Stiffer economic and diplomatic sanctions, which are contained 
in a House-passed bill sponsored by two Black Caucus members, can be effective, 
as can the prospect of a multilateral boycott of Nigerian petroleum. The 
appointment of a special envoy steeped in diplomacy and African affairs, such 
as Donald McHenry, to deal with Abacha may also be appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
 Given what is at stake, it appears that the threshold premise for any 
diplomatic effort should be the release of Abiola and the peaceful transfer of 
presidential and state power. Without a considered response to the Nigerian 
crisis, it is conceivable that even a country like Nigeria can fall from the 
grace of the middle-income national prosperity into an abyss of 
self-destruction.

CANDIDATE BILL CLINTON'S LOST VOICE, OR WHATEVER HAPPENED TO THE BULLY PULPIT? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Robert G. Beckel, Robert G. Beckel, a political analyst, served as campaign 
manager for Walter F. Mondale in 1984. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It seems a dim memory now, but only 22 months ago, Bill Clinton's celebrated 
bus caravan drew thousands of Americans at each stop eager to hear his voice. 
Look back at videotape of those stops, and you realize these weren't phony 
events produced by veteran advance men but, rather, a genuine outpouring of 
mostly regular folks, many with their kids on their shoulders, who came to hear 
the voice of a new Democrat. Even his most ardent opponents had to concede that 
Clinton's voice touched a chord with voters. 
</P>
<P>
 Fast-forward to Clinton last Tuesday in a New Jersey park, with Manhattan's 
World Trade Center towers as a stunning backdrop. Here was the populist 
candidate who touched average Americans, now President, surrounded by the 
typical cast of characters a good advance team uses for "body fill" (read: 
create a crowd): local pols, union bosses, Democratic fund raisers. 
</P>
<P>
 Here was Clinton heeding the call for universal health-care coverage for all 
Americans, an overwhelmingly popular issue with voters, and yet he had to 
scream to be heard over demonstrators; he banged the podium so hard that the 
presidential seal fell off. The crowd reacted warmly, but only warmly. It was a 
good-sized crowd, but not great. It was manufactured, not spontaneous. What 
happened to Clinton's voice? 
</P>
<P>
 Washington pundits will tell you that Clinton lost his voice because he talks 
too much, or he takes on so many issues that his message is too fragmented, or 
the real Clinton is too liberal for the country, or he lost his voice for the 
middle class. There is some truth to all this. But the problem is deeper and 
more fundamental and may be as much about the modern presidency as it is about 
Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 It is certainly true that Presidents are punished for a bad economy, but it 
also used to be true that Presidents are rewarded for a good economy. Not so 
Clinton. This may have something to do with the economy rebounding early in 
Clinton's term and, as a result, the public gave Clinton's economic program 
little credit for the recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 In Ronald Reagan's first term, the economy was miserable for the first two 
years. When it began to rebound, leading up to his landslide victory in '84, 
people gave Reagan credit for correcting a bad economy. 
</P>
<P>
 But it also is true that, increasingly, voters' attention spans are short. 
"What have you done for me lately?" is the voters' cry in modern-day America. 
When voters were hurting in 1992, they listened carefully to Clinton's voice 
assuring them of better times to come. Now that better times have come, they 
yell back at Clinton, "What now, big boy?" 
</P>
<P>
 Another reason Clinton lost his voice can be found in Bob Woodward's book, 
"Agenda." Candidate Clinton spoke eloquently about Washington being captive of 
not only special interests but Establishment interests, especially Wall Street. 
Yet, in a short time, Clinton has become entrapped by those very interests, 
including his holiness Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, lord protector 
of the bond markets. 
</P>
<P>
 In a few months, Clinton not only reversed himself on a middle-class tax cut, 
but set forth a budget clearly aimed at appeasing the markets. This may in the 
long run have been a right thing to do, but held against the towering rhetoric 
of his campaign for the "forgotten" middle class, it rang hollow. And after 
pushing himself as a "new" Democrat willing to take on the Democratic Party's 
special interests (remember Sister Souljah and Jesse Jackson?), President 
Clinton immediately introduced a stimulus package, its opponents charged, that 
reeked of payoffs to every Democratic special interest, from big-city mayors to 
labor unions. This, too, may have been unavoidable, but it gave the Republicans 
more ammunition earlier than they deserved. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton people are fond of laying their troubles on a negative media and, 
to some extent, this is true. I am not so sure, though, that it is all negative 
media but, rather, the amount of media bombarding the American public every 
day. Never in history have there been so many outlets, from standard nightly 
news to an overwhelming number of new talk-TV and talk-radio shows that have 
provided Clinton's enemies with continuous opportunities to pummel him. 
</P>
<P>
 There was a time when the bully pulpit of the presidency stood alone. It now 
must come face to face with several bully pulpits full of anti-Clinton thugs. 
This is not to exonerate the mainstream media, however. Pressure to sell papers 
and grab ratings have made critical and racy stories about the President's 
personal life far more important than they should be. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton team also talks about the right-wing conspiracy to get Clinton. 
This one is absolutely fair. When a fraudulent preacher like Jerry Falwell is 
allowed access to the public airwaves to accuse a sitting President of 
conspiracy to commit murder, things have gone too far. Falwell should be off 
television, out of the pulpit and ready to meet the devil. He deserves no 
better. Then there are the more pleasant reactionaries like Pat Robertson, who 
uses his tax-exempt "ministry" as a blatant political pulpit to attack Clinton. 
And also the terrorist right-to-life conspirators like Randall Terry, who will 
go to all ends, including turning their backs on murder, to get to Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 Add to this the disgraceful pronouncements of GOP senators like New York's 
Alfonse M. D'Amato, who wails away at Whitewater as much to cover up his own 
transgressions as to get to Clinton. I defy any President to sustain his voice 
under such a barrage of bile. 
</P>
<P>
 And, finally, Clinton's voice has lost its edge, because, in truth, he 
promised too much that he couldn't deliver. The White House hates to admit it, 
but this is the fairest criticism of all. 
</P>
<P>
 Today's campaigns for President, particularly in bad times, encourage 
candidates to over-promise. When they don't deliver, they pay a significant 
political price. Despite being a bad candidate, Paul E. Tsongas struck an 
important nerve with the American public when he said, "I am not Santa Claus." 
Government can't do everything for everyone. It may turn out that that kind of 
politics is far better than "'we'll promise you everything" politics. Read: 
Voters are getting smarter and are willing to listen to tough talk. 
</P>
<P>
 Can Clinton regain his voice? I think so. But time is short. The fall 
elections will not serve him well in terms of Democratic losses, but in that 
dark cloud may be his political salvation. If Republican numbers are 
significant enough to put government back into gridlock, Clinton will have no 
choice but to go over the heads of Congress directly to voters. The question 
is, what voice will he speak with and are the voters still listening?

A NOVEL FORCES BANGLADESH TO WEIGH ITS FUTURE AS A SECULAR STATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Paula R. Newberg, Paula R. Newberg is a senior associate at the Carnegie 
Endowment for International Peace. She recently returned from South Asia. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When Muslim clerics in Bangladesh labeled feminist writer Taslima Nasrin a 
blasphemer and called for her execution, they set off a chain reaction whose 
consequences are still unfolding. Mass demonstrations in the capital of Dhaka 
alternately support and condemn Nasrin's controversial novel "Lajja" (Shame). 
Secular women's organizations defend her right to free expression; conservative 
ones criticize her beliefs. 
</P>
<P>
 The Nasrin affair is about women's rights as well as free speech. But the role 
of women in Bangladesh's changing society is only one chapter, albeit 
significant and symbolic, in the country's continuing struggle to balance the 
demands of democracy with the impulses of religious orthodoxies. 
</P>
<P>
 In Bangladesh, this is particularly compelling. The country's history is 
defined by an exceptionally bloody -- indeed, genocidal -- war of independence 
in 1971. When Bangladesh, then-East Pakistan, fought West Pakistan, questions 
of religion intersected those of politics because a significant portion of its 
population was Hindu. East Pakistan was proud of its secularism and the 
political ethic of equity and equality that flowed from it. Its sense of 
democracy was anchored in its demography. 
</P>
<P>
 The current strains between religion and politics caused by Nasrin's novel not 
only tap these undercurrents of schism. They also stoke fears that recent 
democratic gains will be lost in the cacophony of street politics. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon after achieving independence, Bangladesh's dreams of a secular democracy 
were sacrificed to army rule. Assassinations and autocracy marched 
hand-in-hand. The long regime of Lt. Gen. Hussain Mohammed Ershad seemed to 
cement the army's role in politics and government. Only after he resigned amid 
protests in 1990 and elections were held a year later did a semblance of 
democracy re-enter politics. The elections pitted Sheik Hasina Wajed, the 
daughter of the assassinated first president of Bangladesh, Sheik Mujibur 
Rahman, against Begum Khaleda Zia, the widow of former president Gen. Ziaur 
Rahman, who was assassinated in 1981. With Zia as prime minister, a tentative 
democracy returned. 
</P>
<P>
 But she inherited a political history clouded by an unexamined past. Neither 
the genocide of the war of independence, nor questions concerning possible 
collaboration between Bangladeshis and the Pakistan army during the war, nor 
the assassinations of two presidents were confronted publicly. Judicial 
commissions impaneled to look into the assassinations were disbanded before 
they might embarrass the army. Possible ties between the Bangladesh army and 
resurgent Islamic groups were only the subject of whispered rumors. 
Bangladeshis live in a world of suspicion, wary of what their neighbors or 
colleagues might have done during the war or military rule. 
</P>
<P>
 Democracy in Bangladesh is thus built on a foundation of official silence. In 
political terms, this silence translates into the absence of accountability. 
And this, in turn, accounts for a government unsure of its moorings. Adverse 
circumstance, rather than affirmative programs, seems to shape its political 
bearings. Bluster barely disguises political weakness. 
</P>
<P>
 When the army retreated to its barracks, the doors to the past slowly opened 
to bitterness and despair. Published reminisces of the war evolved into a 
public movement to redress the grievances of its victims and punish their 
alleged killers. In a highly politicized environment, a small movement for 
public accountability quickly gained the color of communal prejudice -- among 
Muslims of different language groups and between Muslims and Hindus. 
</P>
<P>
 These divisions coincided with a resurgence of the right-wing Jamaat-i-Islami 
party. The Jamaat, once the handmaiden of the Pakistan army and presumed to be 
a beneficiary of Bangladesh's army as well, speaks on behalf of the religious 
right. It spearheads the anti-Nasrin campaign. Although small secular parties 
have tried to steer politics back to issues of responsible government, the 
momentum of the anti-Nasrin movement -- and Prime Minister Zia's inability to 
balance politics and religion -- threatens their limited success. 
</P>
<P>
 All these events form a backdrop for Nasrin's novel, and its unruly reception. 
The novel's inelegant but incisive descriptions of sectarianism pointedly blame 
the Bangladesh state for manifold irresponsibilities -- fostering division 
rather than community, playing on religious difference rather common secular 
concerns, ignoring the wishes of the majority to succor the whims of agitating 
minority clerics. "Lajja" draws unfortunate parallels between the Pakistani 
discrimination that led to Bangladeshi independence and the inequities that 
Hindus in Bangladesh face today. It blames Bangladeshi Muslims for discarding 
not only Hindus but the secular state that all Bangladeshis were promised. 
</P>
<P>
 No wonder the government is torn between the complicated emotional histories 
that surround the public pillorying of Nasrin and its verbal commitment to 
democratic secularism. 
</P>
<P>
 But poor governance is not simply the result of fundamentalism. Religious 
orthodoxy may have infected politics. More important, however, is that politics 
has invaded religion. Every government, military and civilian, has manipulated 
religious forces rather than confront the tendentious issues that divide 
society. Prime Minister Zia is no exception. She has not taken advantage of her 
fair election to define the debate. Instead, her government grandstands on 
small points and retreats on large ones. The largest issue -- the nature of the 
secular state -- has produced the greatest retreat of all. 
</P>
<P>
 The challenge for Bangladesh is to find a way to look into its past so it can 
move toward the future. Paramount in this self-examination is an understanding 
of the role right-wing religious parties play in politics. In a democracy, that 
should be the function of politics. Otherwise, sectarianism and intolerance 
will breed a darkness in which no real democracy can operate. 
</P>
<P>
 Nasrin may have done her country a favor. Although she has compromised her 
personal safety -- and may well have to flee her home -- she has forced 
Bangladesh to confront its past and present demons. If this government begins 
to act like an accountable democracy, secularists and Islamists may be able to 
find common ground. Only then will democracy find a foothold in Bangladesh.

LOS ANGELES TIMES INTERVIEW; CUAUHTEMOC CARDENAS; RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT IN 
MEXICO AGAINST THE ALL-POWERFUL PRI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Sergio Munoz, Sergio Munoz is the editor of Nuestro Tiempo, The Times' 
weekly Spanish-language edition. He interviewed Cuauhtemoc Cardenas in Mexico 
City. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Since 1986, the year he challenged the political apparatus of the powerful 
Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, demanding open and democratic 
internal selection of candidates and an end to the neoliberal economic policies 
of President Miguel de la Madrid, Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, 60, has been seeking the 
presidency he claims he won in the 1988 election. 
</P>
<P>
 For five years, while Cardenas toured the country trying to organize a viable 
opposition party, his rival, Carlos Salinas de Gortari, became one of the most 
popular presidents in the history of Mexico, orchestrating sweeping economic 
reforms. 
</P>
<P>
 But early this year, things changed for Salinas, for Cardenas and for the 
country. An armed insurrection in the southern state of Chiapas; the 
assassination of PRI candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio, the man chosen by Salinas 
to succeed him and continue his reforms, and a succession of kidnapings of 
prominent Mexicans eroded the long honeymoon of Salinas. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, Cardenas, elected by his party to seek the presidency a 
second time, did not do well in Mexico's first televised political debate. He 
was confronted by the little-known National Action Party, or PAN, candidate, 
Diego Fernandez de Cevallos, who clearly won the debate and jumped to second 
place. Cardenas' popularity, according to an avalanche of mostly unreliable 
polls, dipped into single digits. In addition, he was publicly lectured by the 
spokesperson of the Chiapas rebellion. 
</P>
<P>
 None of these setbacks, however, seems to have made a dent in Cardenas' 
indomitable desire to win the presidency -- perhaps because Cardenas is himself 
the son of a president of Mexico, Gen. Lazaro Cardenas. He has been married to 
Celeste Batel de Cardenas for 31 years. They have three children, ranging from 
age 29 to 10. 
</P>
<P>
 No presidential contest in Mexico has been as competitive as the one that will 
be held Aug. 21. For the first time in 100 years, the outcome of the race is 
uncertain. Cardenas is convinced that, if the election is clean, he will follow 
in his father's footsteps and become the second President Cardenas. The 
question remains, however, what would happen if he loses and feels cheated! 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Question: Is Mexico at the crossroads between democracy and chaos?  
</P>
<P>
 Answer: There are signs of a serious social malaise and profound political 
crisis. The assassinations of Cardinal (Juan Jesus) Posadas and the PRI's 
candidate, Luis Donaldo Colosio; the rebellion in Chiapas; the kidnapings of 
(entrepreneurs Alfredo) Harp and (Angel) Losada -- all these events underline 
the depth of the crisis we are in. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Do you believe most Mexicans support the use of violence as a means to 
transit toward democracy?  
</P>
<P>
 A: The vast majority, including the EZLN (the Zapatista Front, which launched 
the Chiapas uprising,) seek a political solution to the crisis we are living. 
But not even they are calling the country to rise up in arms as they did on 
Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: The EZLN is calling for a convention that would appoint an interim 
president two weeks before the election. Do you agree?  
</P>
<P>
 A: My understanding is that this is one of the possible scenarios under 
consideration, but I do not see it as a plausible scenario for the country. I 
don't believe they would follow that route, because I don't believe it solves 
the current crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Will the results of the election determine whether or not there will be an 
eruption of violence in the country?  
</P>
<P>
 A: The only source of violence that can explode in the country is the 
government. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: So, if on Aug. 22, you get 12% of the vote, will your supporters perceive 
the election as illegitimate and turn to violence?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Regardless of the percentages, I hope that the elections are clean and the 
votes are counted properly. If that is the case, the people will accept the 
results. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What happens if the perception is that the elections were fixed?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Then the government will be confronted through civil means by the 
citizenry. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Is there a way for the PRI to win with your acceptance?  
</P>
<P>
 A: I don't know if there is a way for the PRI to win -- an objective analysis 
of the election shows that given the candidate and considering the way he was 
chosen, there is no way he can pull many votes. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Since the race looks so close, don't you believe that whoever wins will 
need the support of one of the losing candidates? If (PRI candidate Ernesto) 
Zedillo wins by a small margin, would you negotiate some form of coalition 
government?  
</P>
<P>
 A: The problem does not lie with the electoral percentages but in the 
political program that is followed. If the agenda is to prolong the permanence 
of a party encroached within the state, I won't be able to collaborate with 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Ernesto Zedillo has already declared the undesirability of an official 
party within the government.  
</P>
<P>
 A: The problem is that he has not asked Jose Maria Cordoba or Carlos Salinas 
de Gortari for permission to change the very core of the system. I don't 
believe that Carlos Hank and the Atlacomulco Group, who have taken over power 
within the Zedillo group, can lead to democratic change, or even to an honest 
government. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: But I understand that you have negotiated with the government in the past. 
With Manuel Camacho in 1988.  
</P>
<P>
 A: Camacho looked for me several times, but when we insisted that the only 
proper thing to do was to clean up the election-process results, the talks 
ended. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What happens if Diego Fernandez de Cevallos wins?  
</P>
<P>
 A: That is another impossible option. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: But if Diego wins, would you negotiate a coalition government with him?  
</P>
<P>
 A: No, because his program is not democratic. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Then what would be a possible option?  
</P>
<P>
 A: The logical outcome, and the more plausible scenario, is that I win the 
election. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: If the race is indeed tight -- the margin between the three of you is close 
-- and you win, would you be able to govern?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Yes, because then the winner would have a democratic and constitutional 
legitimacy. But also because by loosing the election and cutting off all the 
political and economic support to the official party, that party becomes 
nothing more than ashes that can be blown away with a puff of air. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Once again, President Salinas has said he would like to have a dialogue 
with you. Why don't you accept?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Because he has not set an agenda. I've proposed one: the correction of the 
electoral lists; displaying them up at the booths, and providing fair and equal 
access to the media for all candidates. We can meet and talk about that. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: All the polls indicate your popularity diminished dramatically after the 
debate.  
</P>
<P>
 A: Well, then there exists a contradiction between the polls and the huge 
audiences I encounter in my campaign tour throughout the country. But the odd 
thing is that if I can't draw above 8% or 10% of the vote, then why is the 
government so concerned with me? 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Many of your leftist followers were disappointed with your performance 
during the debate because they felt you leaned too much to the center instead 
of advancing the ideas of the left. Do you find their criticism fair?  
</P>
<P>
 A: No. I believe the program we have been advancing is the most viable to lift 
the country from its current crisis and to spark a new stage for sustained 
economic growth and to achieve better social conditions for the population. 
Perhaps I should have answered swiftly to the accusations launched by Diego 
against me.  
</P>
<P>
 But the debate should be analyzed not only by what happened that night but 
also by the spin in the media immediately after it. In the end, however, both 
the debate and the post-debate spin turned out to be irrelevant to the people 
-- judging by the response I've been getting throughout the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Mexico defines itself as Latin American, but neither politically nor 
economically has there been unity of purpose with Latin America. It has been 
with the U.S. that real linkage, both positive and negative, has taken place. 
Which will be the context of your foreign policy if you become president?  
</P>
<P>
 A: It will be diverse. We'll seek an effective economic and political 
integration with Latin America, but we'll also maintain a close trade and 
economic relationship with the countries of NAFTA, while at the same time 
seeking a larger economic diversification toward Europe and the Pacific Basin. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: You opposed the North American Free Trade Agreement, but now you seem to 
have changed your mind --  
</P>
<P>
 A: I never opposed NAFTA. I opposed it only because I felt we could have 
signed a better agreement -- one that would have opened other perspectives to 
improve our development. Such an agreement meant investing in Mexico to 
diminish the existing differences between partners, to improve the social 
condition of our population. This meant equalizing the field among the three 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: First with George Bush and later with Bill Clinton, President Salinas was 
able to articulate the best relationship ever with the U.S. Do you believe 
Salinas was wrong in thinking the U.S. could be a partner and suspending the 
traditional Mexican resentment toward the United States?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Salinas was wrong in his policies toward Mexico -- not in his foreign 
policies. And he was wrong because he forgot he had to work for the benefit of 
the country, and what he did here was to create 40 million poor people and 14 
million unemployed. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Many think you represent the policies of the past that did not work. To 
test you, they ask: Do you believe that the economic reform implemented in the 
past 12 years is irreversible?  
</P>
<P>
 A: No, of course I do not accept it as irreversible, because if I did, I would 
be bringing Mexico into a deeper crisis, I would be creating more unemployed, 
more poor people, more layoffs, more businesses closed. The free-market economy 
in Mexico is a right that is in our constitution, and Mexico has never tried to 
be an isolationist nation. But the question is how are we going to open up. We 
have to implement an alternative policy that creates new jobs, promotes growth 
instead of stagnation. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: There is, however, much uneasiness in the private sector in Mexico and in 
the U.S. with the possibility of your victory.  
</P>
<P>
 A: The ones that are afraid are the 24 that Salinas made billionaires because 
those fortunes have been made with the help of the powerful within the 
administration. If they had not become partners with officials in high places 
and been given privileges from them, they would not have made that kind of 
money. 
</P>
<P>
 We want to establish real competition in business instead of propitiating 
monopolies. With real competition, we could have improved many of the most 
dynamic sectors of the economy -- such as the television, telephones, copper 
and cement industries. Monopolies are not healthy for the economy, or socially. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: If you are not convinced that the election was clean, what will you do? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I will defend my vote through every civil route! 
</P>
<P>
 Q: But that is what you did in '88.  
</P>
<P>
 A: We'll do it better this time -- because we are better organized this time. 
We did not accomplish better results in '88 because we had no cohesion in the 
command and had not worked on the possibility of a general mobilization that we 
now have.

CONTROVERSIAL HOME AIDS TEST: WHY IT'S NEEDED; ON BALANCE IT COULD HELP RETARD 
THE SPREAD OF THE EPIDEMIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 No further delay can be tolerated in gaining the upper hand against the AIDS 
epidemic. This terrible disease has already claimed nearly a quarter of a 
million American lives. Astonishingly, as many as 100,000 people annually still 
contract the HIV virus that causes AIDS, even though its transmission is now 
quite preventable in most cases. 
</P>
<P>
 A potentially potent new tool in stopping the spread of the virus is the home 
HIV test kit. It would allow people to draw blood at home, mail it in 
anonymously to a laboratory and get the results and counseling by phone. A 
groundswell of support for these tests is building among AIDS specialists, gay 
groups and other interests, including the NAACP. The Food and Drug 
Administration, originally chary, is expected to approve general marketing of 
home tests within a month or two. We strongly support that, as long as the FDA 
imposes strict controls to prevent misuse and to ensure that those testing 
positive get proper support and counseling. All involved agree that the AIDS 
test is now so reliable that the problem of false negatives and positives is 
minimal. The chief objection comes from the National Alliance of Lesbian and 
Gay Health Clinics, whose leaders argue that counseling in clinics and 
doctors's offices is essential to prevent suicides if the test is positive, and 
to bring the person into treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 This concern cannot be dismissed lightly, and those clinics have done heroic 
work. But the fact is that 85% of Americans have not been tested, nor have the 
majority of those most at risk, according to the Centers for Disease Control. A 
major barrier to testing is fear or embarrassment at appearing at a public 
clinic or medical office to give a blood sample. In more remote areas, 
hostility and ignorance among local physicians is a further deterrent. 
Moreover, studies show that most people do not now get any counseling at all 
after the test. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed home test would cost about $35 at drug stores. It includes 
equipment to draw a few drops of blood, which are placed on several circles, 
smaller than a dime, on blotter paper. The sample is mailed, prepaid and 
anonymously, to a laboratory. Using an identification number, the purchaser 
later telephones toll-free for the results -- and counseling and referrals if 
positive. Proponents argue that most people are more comfortable discussing 
such sensitive matters with the stranger on the telephone than in person. 
</P>
<P>
 While there is no cure for AIDS, there are treatments that prolong life. 
Moreover, those who test positive can take precautions against spreading the 
virus. Some fear excessive testing, but for now the problem is inadequate 
testing. The most obvious candidates are sexually active homosexuals, 
intravenous drug users and recipients of transfusions. The risk drops after 
that, but many experts urge all sexually active men and women to get tested, 
particularly if they believe a partner falls into a high-risk group. Also, 
pregnant women should be tested routinely, because drugs can prevent 
transmission of the virus to the fetus. 
</P>
<P>
 In approving the home test, the FDA faces many tough questions: Can it assure 
both anonymity and timely counseling? Can it prevent employers or relatives 
from coercing people into taking the test and disclosing results? How many 
languages must the accompanying literature be printed in? What are the 
implications of bypassing doctors and other health professionals? Will the test 
really reduce risky behavior, or have the opposite effect? 
</P>
<P>
 In all this, it is important not to let economic factors overcome medical 
ones. The kit manufacturers, the largest being Johnson & Johnson, have an 
obvious economic interest. So do the clinics, who fear being squeezed out. The 
FDA should try to ensure the survival of clinics like the Gay and Lesbian 
Community Services Center here in Los Angeles, which has been particularly 
effective in bringing AIDS education, testing and care to immigrant communities 
that the self test is unlikely to penetrate. 
</P>
<P>
 The AIDS home test raises many difficult problems. But in our view, as the 
AIDS scourge marches on, the benefits far outweigh the risks.

URBAN MOTELS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Motel owners are not the criminals! "Erasing the Grimy Side of Motel Life" 
(July 24) depicts "big city" motels as sleazy, dirty "magnets for crime." 
Because of the inability of the police to control crime in our city, the "good" 
(as well as the "bad") motels are now being cited by the city and are required 
to hire expensive security guards, put up restrictive walls and gates, put up 
bold signs all over prohibiting prostitution, and get the license numbers, 
photo ID, full name, address, make and year of vehicle registration of all 
persons entering the motel.These are only four of the 27 conditions imposed 
against the motel owners. Who would want to stay in a place surrounded by these 
walls, graphic signs, and security guards? Sounds more like a prison than a 
pleasant vacation stay!  
</P>
<P>
 What your article doesn't report is that the city disregarded and omitted from 
the public record a portion of its own zoning analyst's report which 
specifically refers to these motels as the "victims." Most of these motel 
owners are Asian and are clearly being unlawfully discriminated against. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of these motel owners are honorable men and women who take great pride in 
their motels. They do not allow their properties to "run rampant with drugs and 
prostitution"! Whenever they call the police for assistance, the police ignore 
them, and each phone call is used against them as further proof that they are 
the cause of the crime.

GANGS IN VENICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In recent months, 17 people were killed and 55 wounded in the dirty race war 
conducted by gangs in the Venice-Oakwood area. Citizens must be encouraged to 
speak up against violence -- assert their civil rights and not be intimidated 
by gangs. 
</P>
<P>
 A Times' article (July 22) stated that I was "sternly criticized for calling 
Venice gang members 'termites.' " Those who would coddle and defend the gangs 
in face of their atrocities confuse other youngsters not yet affiliated with 
gang-like activity. 
</P>
<P>
 A 30-year-old cook was fatally shot in front of his two children in 
Venice-Oakwood by a cowardly gang member. He had no gang affiliations. 
</P>
<P>
 More than stern criticism should be directed toward vicious gangs. We must 
stand up for our rights to walk, talk and move freely anywhere in our great 
city without fear of gang violence. Turn the termites in to proper authorities!

WATERS-KING SLUGFEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Re "Waters-King Verbal Slugfest Spills Over Onto House Floor," July 30: 
</P>
<P>
 Thanks to Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Los Angeles) for telling Rep. Peter King 
(R-N.Y.) that "You're out of order. Shut up!" Anyone who viewed the July 28 
testimony by White House staff before the House Banking Committee on the 
Whitewater affair saw the vitriolic and malicious way in which King addressed 
Hillary Clinton's chief of staff, Margaret Williams.Although other witnesses 
were subjected to pointed interrogation during the many hours of testimony, no 
one else was addressed with the lengthy and aggressively insulting tone as was 
directed at Williams by King. 
</P>
<P>
 Some may have a problem with Waters' attitude, but I say it's time we get out 
of the victim role, stand up, speak our minds and let these individuals get the 
clear message that their abusive and inappropriate manner toward women will no 
longer be tolerated. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm glad Rep. Waters was there to set him straight.

MASS TRANSIT IN LOS ANGELES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * The Opinion articles by William Fulton and Kevin Starr ("Mass Transit in the 
City of Cars," July 31) provided perspectives that have generally been 
overlooked in the coverage given the MTA budget deficit, fare increases and 
labor disputes.  
</P>
<P>
 I have long believed that for bus advocates to attack rail transit is akin to 
"cutting off your nose to spite your face." While I accept Fulton's thesis of 
why this is so, I do believe that he understates the influence the MTA has over 
road building. For example the MTA does determine how two federal sources of 
funding are spent, surface transportation program (STP) and congestion 
management and air quality (CMAQ). These are sizable funding sources that are 
flexible; they can be spent on either transit or highways. Indeed the MTA has 
opted to spend the bulk of these funds on highway projects. Furthermore while 
the Southern California Assn. of Governments is officially designated as the 
agency that determines which projects will receive federal and state funds, it 
typically rubber-stamps decisions made by the MTA. 
</P>
<P>
 On Aug. 2, an article described how Foothill Transit operates former MTA 
routes for $38 per hour less than the MTA does. However another story needs to 
be told. In the chart comparing the cost per hour of providing transit service 
by the 13 largest transit operators in Los Angeles County, six systems have a 
lower cost per hour than Foothill. Of particular note are Long Beach and Santa 
Monica. Unlike Foothill Transit, these are older urban bus systems that do not 
contract out services, have longstanding union contracts, pay their drivers $5 
per hour more than Foothill Transit and provide benefits comparable to the MTA. 
 
</P>
<P>
 Transit advocates need to stop attacking rail transit and start urging the MTA 
board to devote more flexible funds to transit. They also need to urge the MTA 
board to lower the cost per hour of providing bus service to be comparable to 
Santa Monica and Long Beach, reinvesting the savings into more and better bus 
service.  
</P>

<P>
 * Starr's article argues that "there is no such thing as a functioning city 
without mass transit" and that our "automobile culture" is actually dependent 
on public transportation, as shown by the freeway congestion caused by the MTA 
strike. 
</P>
<P>
 Wouldn't it be more accurate to say that the MTA strike illustrated the 
fallacy of relying on mass transit systems to solve our area's transportation 
needs, and what we really need is to improve the highway system, which has been 
neglected in favor of Red Lines, Blue Lines, super-buses and strident 
government campaigns to get cars off the roads? It is hard to imagine a 
half-million commuters being stranded by the simultaneous breakdown of a 
half-million cars.

 * I would like to "adopt" a supervisor or an MTA official to ride with me on 
my bus route as I go to work and shop. One invitation only should be enough to 
open their eyes. Has Supervisor Gloria Molina ever gotten wet while waiting for 
the bus in the rain? 
</P>
<P>
 I resent those rich VIPs who never use mass transit as they make decisions 
regarding my daily commute. As the MTA does away with the monthly bus passes, 
the word token(ism) takes on a new meaning.

OLYMPICS FOUNDATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Your article "Grants by '84 Olympic Foundation Dwindle" (July 26) failed to 
give an accurate portrayal of the Amateur Athletic Foundation's efforts and 
financial expenditures. 
</P>
<P>
 The AAF is an operating foundation. As such, it not only awards grants but 
also initiates and operates its own programs. The AAF program expenditures have 
consistently gone up every year since 1985 from $86,435 to $1.3 million in 
1993. These programs ensure that youngsters who are not part of established 
sports institutions, which we serve through grants, are also able to experience 
the magic of sports. 
</P>
<P>
 Therefore, the foundation's total expenditures, including grants and programs, 
have stayed constant throughout the years, averaging $6,191,889. Contrary to 
the statement that the foundation is "barely satisfying federal requirements 
that it spend at least 5% of its invested assets," the foundation's expenses 
have averaged 6.92%. This is much higher than most other foundations. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite what your article would have people believe, the foundation is not 
stockpiling money. If you take into consideration the eroding effect of 
inflation, the actual purchasing power of today's higher assets are in fact 
lower than that of the original endowment. By investing back into the community 
nearly $60 million in the last 10 years, we have spent approximately two-thirds 
of the original endowment. 
</P>
<P>
 The article also inaccurately reported that this was the first year that the 
county had charged fees for recreational swimming. In fact the fee structure 
was imposed last year. At the request of the county, the AAF provided an 
emergency grant of $20,000 in 1993 for additional scholarship money. 
</P>
<P>
 The article failed to mention that every year for the last nine years the 
foundation has supported the summer swim program at county pools. This program 
provides money for the lifeguards to teach kids to swim competitively and to 
offer scholarships. In the last nine years the foundation has awarded $367,036 
in grants to the County Park and Recreation Department and $325,227 in grants 
to the City Recreation and Parks Department. In addition, the AAF has spent 
$512,000 to operate this program.

 The financial crisis suffered by governmental agencies should be a concern to 
all of us. We are doing our part to make sure that the youngsters who want to 
participate in sports are able to do so. We must all work together, however, to 
try to find a long-term solution to this crisis. The time for short-term fixes 
is over.

PRIVATIZATION EDGES ON; SETTLEMENT OF TRANSIT STRIKE LEAVES KEY GOVERNMENT 
INNOVATION INTACT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Only the commuters were the clear winners when the strike against the 
Metropolitan Transportation Authority ended last week. But in the long run the 
biggest winners could be taxpayers, because the strike -- while painful and 
probably unnecessary -- did not stop the necessary movement toward 
privatization in public transit. 
</P>
<P>
 For nearly two weeks, many thousands of Los Angeles-area commuters faced a 
drive into work that was even tougher than normal. With service cut to a bare 
minimum by the agency that runs both the region's biggest bus fleet and a 
growing subway and trolley system, many commuters had been forced to find 
alternative ways to get around. If they opted for cars, that added to the 
already daunting congestion on many local highways. Anyone who faced that 
traffic had to cheer the settlement reached Tuesday between MTA and the 
Amalgamated Transit Union, representing MTA mechanics. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the two protagonists in that unfortunate standoff, neither got 
everything it wanted. Which leads to the obvious question: Was this strike 
necessary? After all, the two unions representing MTA drivers and clerks 
reached agreement on new contracts without a strike. 
</P>
<P>
 The ATU unfortunately felt a need to be especially militant this year because 
of the recent layoffs of some MTA mechanics. The union did win an agreement 
that there will be no more layoffs of ATU members. But the MTA got the union to 
agree to participate in a joint committee to review bids for subcontracting out 
MTA services to the private sector. Given the hard line ATU took against any 
contracting out, that was no small concession. 
</P>
<P>
 It's important because Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan and other officials 
on the MTA governing board want to press forward with privatization of transit 
services as a means of saving money. They point with justification to the less 
costly, but popular, bus service provided in the San Gabriel Valley by Foothill 
Transit, a private operator that began taking over bus lines there in 1988 and 
is now the second-largest transit operator in the county. Significantly, MTA's 
new contract with the drivers' union allows for the transfer of more bus lines 
to private operators. So the useful trend continues -- as it should.

COLUMN RIGHT / PAUL CRAIG ROBERTS; FISKE'S EXIT REOPENS HOPE ON A MYSTERY; THE 
NEW PROSECUTOR MUST BE TOUGHER. START WITH SUSPICIONS ABOUT VINCENT FOSTER'S 
DEATH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL CRAIG ROBERTS, Paul Craig Roberts, former assistant treasury secretary, 
is chairman of the Institute for Political Economy in Washington. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Someone's lying big time about the death of White House deputy counsel Vincent 
Foster. Is it original Whitewater special prosecutor Robert Fiske, the FBI or 
the star witness? A discrepancy of this magnitude cannot be swept under the 
rug. It is of far more consequence than the conflicting testimony of Treasury 
officials about their White House meetings that is occupying the attention of 
Congress and the media. 
</P>
<P>
 The discrepancies that are beginning to cause doubts about Fiske's 
investigation and inquiry into Foster's death are similar to the doubts 
senators have about the testimony of deputy Treasury secretary Roger Altman 
concerning his Whitewater contacts with the White House. They may have played a 
role in the decision Friday of the three Appeals Court judges, David Sentelle, 
John Butzner and Joseph Sneed, to take Fiske off the investigation and to 
replace him with former Solicitor General and Appeals Court Judge Kenneth W. 
Starr. 
</P>
<P>
 In both cases, there are unresolved contradictions. Altman's testimony is 
inconsistent with that of other officials and diary entries, and Fiske's report 
on Foster's death is contradicted by public statements of the star 
"confidential witness" -- interviewed by Fiske and cited in his report -- who 
found Foster's body. 
</P>
<P>
 Last Thursday, G. Gordon Liddy had the so-called confidential witness live on 
his radio show. CW, who discovered Foster's body in Fort Marcy Park, Va., just 
across the Potomac River from Washington, at 5:45 p.m. on July 20, 1993, said 
several times with emphasis that he told the FBI that Foster's hands were palms 
up, thumbs out and there was no gun in either hand. 
</P>
<P>
 This information is startling, because by the time the police arrived at the 
unattended body 45 minutes later, there was a gun in Foster's hand -- moreover, 
a gun without any fingerprints on it. Normally, a discrepancy of this magnitude 
would set off alarm bells. 
</P>
<P>
 But not with Fiske. Instead, Fiske has a section in his report, "Why didn't CW 
see a gun in Foster's hand?" In this section, Fiske puts words in CW's mouth. 
The report claims that "CW has further stated that the natural foliage in the 
area made it difficult to see Foster's hands." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps I am hearing-impaired, but I distinctly heard the witness deny that he 
said any such thing. What the witness did say was that the FBI agent badgered 
him with hypothetical conditions in which he might not see a gun, but these 
were not the conditions that he observed. 
</P>
<P>
 Fiske's report seizes on the hypothetical discussion, not on the witness' 
report of the actual conditions that he observed. I heard the witness say that 
the police picture of Foster's right hand, palm down with the trigger guard 
around his thumb was "clearly and absolutely not what I saw." 
</P>
<P>
 CW needs to be called before Congress to testify, but there is little chance 
that Democrats will let this happen. In the House, Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez 
(D-Tex.), who is masterminding the Whitewater cover-up by the Banking 
Committee, won't even permit the muzzled Republicans to mention Foster's death. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Senate, the investigation is about the veracity of Treasury officials. 
Altman is being hung out to dry to deflect attention away from the First 
Couple's Whitewater misdealings. 
</P>
<P>
 In his old age, Gonzalez has destroyed his reputation by blatantly abusing his 
power in order to cover up the political wrong-doing of others. New York Times 
columnist William Safire, the Wall Street Journal editorial board and Accuracy 
in Media believe that Fiske, too, has destroyed his reputation by participating 
in the cover-up. 
</P>
<P>
 To avoid the same fate, Starr must give us a real investigation of Vincent 
Foster's death and not fob off the unambiguous testimony of the witness who 
found the body. If the full dimensions of Whitewatergate are ever to be 
revealed, Starr will have to be a far tougher investigator than Fiske.

AGE DISCRIMINATION -- AGAINST THE YOUNG; ENTITLEMENTS: THE AVERAGE AGE OF 
'REFORMERS' IS 57. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JON COWAN and ROB NELSON, Jon Cowan and Rob Nelson are co-executive 
directors of Lead or Leave, a non-partisan advocacy organization for young 
people. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On Monday, a little-noticed federal panel, the Bipartisan Commission on 
Entitlement and Tax Reform, will release preliminary recommendations on how the 
government can limit the runaway growth of entitlement spending. However worthy 
the goals of the commission may be, the age and background of its members 
jeopardize its ability to produce meaningful or significant reforms. 
</P>
<P>
 Charged with redesigning America's entitlement programs to ensure their 
soundness and equity, the commission has completely shut out the group that 
will be most affected by its recommendations -- the 130 million Americans under 
35. 
</P>
<P>
 It is this post-Boomer cohort that will inherit the tab for Uncle Sam's 
current fiscal irresponsibility. It is these so-called Generations X and Y who 
face sharp tax increases and big benefit cuts if entitlement programs are not 
restructured to reflect changing demographic and economic realities. Current 
trends, for example, indicate that today's 27-year-old will pay $203,000 more 
in taxes than he receives in government benefits, compared with a 72-year-old, 
who will receive $98,600 more in benefits than he paid in. 
</P>
<P>
 Why such disparity? In 1939, when Social Security was created, there were 50 
active workers to pay for each retiree. That ratio dropped to 20 to 1 by 1950 
and will plummet to just 2 to 1 by 2025. To support this upside-down pyramid -- 
and the more generous benefits of the past 50 years -- workers born after 1960 
can expect up to 40% of their future salaries to go to payroll taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the massive generational implications of our current system -- and the 
changes contemplated in the health-care debate -- the 32-member commission 
includes not a single member under 40. More than one-third of the members are 
over 60, and seven already qualify for Social Security. Members' average age is 
57.  
</P>
<P>
 A commission on race relations would not have been established without any 
minority members, nor would a commission on church and state be set up without 
religious groups participating. Yet apparently no one felt that a commission on 
entitlements should include members of the generation that will pay for its 
reforms. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of bringing in new and younger voices -- including those who have 
proved their expertise on entitlements issues -- the commission was made up 
principally of people who have consistently refused to support real entitlement 
reform: members of Congress. Three-quarters of the commission members are 
either current or former representatives. Many of the architects of the current 
entitlements crisis are now deciding how to "reform" the system. 
</P>
<P>
 In most cases, the congressional members of the commission are not the young 
fiscal reformers elected in recent years. They are entitlement war horses like 
former House Ways and Means Chairman Dan Rostenkowski (D-Ill., 36 years in 
Congress), ranking Ways and Means minority member Bill Archer (R-Tex., 24 years 
in Congress) and House Energy and Commerce Chairman John Dingell (D-Mich., 39 
years in Congress.)  
</P>
<P>
 Monday's report is only preliminary; there is still time for the commission to 
add a few younger members before the final report in December. Generational 
fairness demands no less.

PERSPECTIVE ON REDEVELOPMENT; AN L.A. INSTITUTION REINVENTS ITSELF; A CITY

 "Voice Where It's Needed Most" is how The Times described a plan for the 
Community Redevelopment Agency by Ed Avila, CRA administrator, in January, 
1993. Avila had issued a New Year's resolution calling for the redirection of 
the resources and energies of this powerful institution to communities most in 
need.  
</P>
<P>
 Has Avila's promise to remake the CRA been fulfilled? Or are the stories true 
that the CRA no longer has a useful role, that support for redevelopment is 
gone and the organization is being quietly killed by popular demand and 
political will? 
</P>
<P>
 We believe that reports of the agency's demise are the product of uninformed 
opinion. Such tales stand in stark contrast with our experience working day to 
day in communities throughout Los Angeles, communities in which the CRA is 
playing an important and welcome role as a partner in making a difference. 
</P>
<P>
 The CRA has repositioned itself to respond to the difficult challenges of Los 
Angeles today. The fact that the CRA is involved in some way with all of our 
lives makes an important statement about the current role of the agency and 
demonstrates the transformation in this organization over a relatively short 
period time. 
</P>
<P>
 Why the spurious accounts of the CRA's demise? Perhaps because it is no longer 
recognizable to people who cling to images from the past. Redevelopment has a 
certain place in the history of our city, including the building of a 
world-class Downtown with hundreds of thousands of jobs and working in 
neighborhoods from San Pedro to Watts to North Hollywood. But as our city 
changes -- demographically, economically, environmentally, politically -- we 
can only expect a major institution such as the CRA to change with it. 
</P>
<P>
 Change is difficult. Sometimes an organization can be caught behind the curve 
or lose touch, as the CRA may have done in the late 1980s. At that time, 
controversies seemed to be constantly erupting, earning the agency labels of 
"rogue," "embattled," "troubled" and "beleaguered." Public confidence eroded, 
bringing into serious question whether redevelopment was truly serving the best 
interest of the community. But this is 1994: What we must ask now is where we 
are today with respect to one of the most potentially powerful resources 
available to help revitalize our city, community by community. 
</P>
<P>
 From our vantage point, this is what can be clearly seen: 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds of inner-city leaders, residents and businesses are meeting each week 
in areas from East Los Angeles to Westlake/Pico Union, from South-Central to 
Koreatown, from the San Fernando Valley to Downtown, planning for the 
revitalization of their communities in partnership with the CRA. 
</P>
<P>
 Negotiations were successfully completed to lift the tax-increment cap on the 
Central Business District Project, which, if approved by the court, will allow 
substantial resources to flow to support communities and people in need. A 
monumental achievement, given the often competing interests of the mayor, the 
city, county Board of Supervisors, school board and other taxing entities that 
had to reach consensus. 
</P>
<P>
 Small and medium-sized businesses in Central City East, employers of thousands 
of blue-collar workers in burgeoning Downtown industrial areas who were once 
skeptical of the CRA, are now working with the agency to expand their 
operations and work force. 
</P>
<P>
 The CRA has played a pivotal part in recommending actions for city leadership 
in the critical arena of economic development. Because of its expertise and 
capacity to respond, the agency is now being considered as the organizational 
core of a new citywide economic development agency, which is urgently needed to 
bring focus and additional resources to city efforts to expand economic 
opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
 In tribute to delivering on these promises, the agency has been asked to do 
even more, in some cases by those who have been its harshest critics. For 
example, earthquake-ravaged communities in the San Fernando Valley are 
considering the bold step of partnering with the CRA in their rebuilding. This 
is a remarkable achievement. 
</P>
<P>
 What happened? How did an institution once vilified for being unresponsive to 
the community become a primary resource in its times of greatest need? 
</P>
<P>
 Through painstaking and deliberate actions, Avila has made good on his promise 
to redirect the agency's activities and restore public confidence in 
redevelopment. In hundreds of meetings with community members, local 
organizations, businesses and elected officials, the CRA listened and responded 
to community concerns. At the City Council, Avila brought a new way of doing 
business in a more collaborative and open fashion. It was this leadership that 
created a level of coordination and cooperation needed to meet the difficult 
challenges ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, when times were toughest, the CRA has been able to deliver its 
substantial resources with community support and in partnership with the city 
family. Emergency-grant programs, recovery-planning efforts, 
earthquake-recovery initiatives all flowed from a constructive, collaborative 
atmosphere in which redevelopment is discussed for what it is -- a tool to 
build communities, bridging the interests of our most distressed communities 
and the economic engines that drive revitalization. 
</P>
<P>
 Eighteen months after Avila proposed his changes, we are individually and 
collectively witness to the fact that his voice has not only been heard; his 
promise to refocus the energies and resources of the agency has also been 
fulfilled.  
</P>
<P>
 Far from the long reign of the agency coming to an inglorious end, as some 
would falsely have people believe, the real CRA of today is alive and well. 
Some may not recognize it in its new incarnation, but it clearly has become one 
of the most important local institutions guiding Los Angeles' recovery.  
</P>
<P>
 Don't let anyone tell you otherwise.

IS RIORDAN CREATING A NEW COMMITTEE OF TWENTY-FIVE TO RUN THE CITY? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Xandra Kayden, Xandra Kayden is a senior fellow at the Institute of 
Leadership Studies at Loyola-Marymount University and author of Surviving Power 
(Free Press). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The second year of the Riordan administration promises to be more controlled 
and more in conflict with the city's established powers. It also threatens to 
be secretive, is in danger of serious conflicts of interest and is moving in 
the direction of recreating the Committee of Twenty-Five that once ran Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem is that Richard Riordan is trying to become an effective 
politician in a governmental structure designed to protect us from him. 
Decision-making power is dispersed, and the professional civil service will 
outlast him and other elected officials. The effect is to dilute his potential 
for achievement. 
</P>
<P>
 Today's urban reformers, in contrast to the Progressives who drew up the City 
Charter, seek to overcome entrenched interests by granting more power to mayors 
-- who can be held accountable by all the voters -- and more power to 
neighborhoods to help people regain some control over their lives. The trend is 
to limit the authority of city councils, which can be captured by business 
interests, and professional bureaucracies. 
</P>
<P>
 While Riordan believes neighborhoods must ultimately solve their own problems, 
he would not empower them. Instead, he would keep government out of the hands 
of the "politicians" -- that is, the City Council -- and of the civil servants 
by shifting power to an elite business community safe from accountability, even 
identity. In turning to the private sector to raise large sums of money for his 
task forces -- for upgrading departments' technology and for sprucing up the 
official mayor's residence -- Riordan is creating a new oligarchy. 
</P>
<P>
 Creating a partnership between government and the private sector may well be 
both noble and appropriate at a time when the city's coffers are low and the 
demand for change is strong. Indeed, cutting through red tape does make things 
happen, but subverting city government is no way to reform it. 
</P>
<P>
 The question of a public-private partnership is complicated. An obvious 
disadvantage is the possibility of a conflict of interest. If we don't know 
who's making the decisions, or contributing large sums of money, we don't know 
whether or not there is a conflict. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, many people would like to contribute time, expertise and money to the 
city, and there ought to be a way to satisfy their desires and meet city needs. 
A traditional approach is to route private resources to private groups -- 
programs for the homeless, gang rehabilitation, extra opportunities for kids -- 
or to business experts helping struggling businesses. Another would be to 
establish a public foundation, to which anyone could contribute, though with 
limits of, say, $1,000 per individual and $5,000 per organization. The 
identities of all contributors would be disclosed. A third course would be to 
follow the example of L.A. Works and encourage people to contribute themselves 
one day a month, or one day a year, to paint a day-care center or plant trees. 
</P>
<P>
 The complex issues of how to distribute public resources among competing 
interests do not lend themselves to volunteer activity. This is a job for 
elected or appointed officials acting in an approved, public manner. Such 
decision-making can be messy and rarely produces clear victories, which 
explains why some of Riordan's private task forces have either failed to submit 
proposals he thought realistic, or have grown frustrated with the mayor's 
inability to implement their recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
 The urge to raise millions of dollars from a select group of contributors for 
a desirable and popular goal -- like upgrading the technology of the Los 
Angeles Police Department -- is understandable. The strength of the Committee 
of Twenty-Five was that it was powerful, knew what it wanted and could make it 
happen for the "greater good." It was also elitist and failed to understand 
others. But whether the community numbers 25 or 100; whether it is composed of 
rich, white men or a mix of ethnicities and genders, it is not democracy. 
</P>
<P>
 If Riordan believes that neighborhoods must solve their own day-to-day 
problems, he needs to devise an infrastructure that makes it possible for 
people to work together at the local level. This is a formidable task, since 
the capacity to develop and sustain organizations varies from neighborhood to 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 There are some areas of the city that have no local organizations, while there 
are some ethnic groups who believe that any participation in city government is 
tantamount to criminal activity. What Los Angeles needs is hundreds of 
committees of twenty-five, each working in its own neighborhood, backed by city 
authority and resources. 
</P>
<P>
 In his second year, Riordan should move out to the communities of the city 
rather than rely on the private sector he knows firsthand to circumvent the 
public sector his administration distrusts. He needs a staff with political 
skills, not one that prefers closed doors and few participants. Success for 
Riordan -- and for us -- will depend on his ability as a politician, not his 
talent as a businessman.

 CITY COUNCIL 
</P>
<P>
 * CITY HALL RENOVATION: Approved a $153-million plan to renovate City Hall to 
correct seismic deficiencies and bring it into compliance with code 
requirements for fire, safety, disabled access and energy efficiency. 
Historical features of the 27-story tower will be preserved. Work is to begin 
Sept. 30, when all the occupants on floors 11 through 27 are relocated into a 
Downtown building. The renovation will take at least two years, during which 
only occupants of the second, third and fourth floors, which include the 
mayor's office and City Council, will remain in the building. 
</P>
<P>
 * REWARD OFFERED: Approved a $25,000 reward for information leading to the 
arrest and conviction of the person or persons responsible for the drive-by 
shooting death of 80-year-old May Bell Dunkentell. She was shot while standing 
in her kitchen at 2214 E. 107 St. in Watts about 5:30 p.m. June 30. 
</P>
<P>
 BOARD OF PUBLIC WORKS 
</P>
<P>
 * STREET CLOSURES: Approved the closure of Sunset Boulevard between Western 
and Normandie avenues on Monday and Tuesday from 8 p.m. to 6 a.m. to allow 
filming of "Strange Days," a movie starring Angela Bassett. Also approved the 
closure of 4th Street from Beaudry Avenue to Hill Street, and 6th Street from 
Mateo Street to Boyle Avenue, on Saturday and Aug. 14 from 4 to 10 a.m. and 4 
to 9 p.m. for the filming of a Honda commercial. HOW THEY VOTED 
</P>
<P>
 How South-Central and Eastside City Council representatives voted on selected 
issues. * MINORITY BUSINESS AID: Accepted a $767,500 grant from the U.S. 
Department of Commerce to fund the Minority Business Opportunity Committee, 
which was established in January to enhance opportunities for minority-owned 
businesses, and Los Angeles Recovery, a program that helps minority businesses 
obtain contracts related to the recovery from the Jan. 17 earthquake. The goal 
of Los Angeles Recovery is to help minority business secure $400 million in 
contracts. Acceptance of the grant was met with some opposition because the 
immediate release of the funding was contingent upon hiring Rocky Delgadillo, 
an aide to Mayor Richard Riordan, as program manager. If Delgadillo was not 
hired, officials said the funding would be delayed and possibly withdrawn. 
Councilwoman Rita Walters charged the federal government with using 
intimidation tactics concerning Delgadillo's hiring, but Councilman Richard 
Alatorre defended Delgadillo as the best person for the job. Delgadillo is to 
be paid $100,000 for a year's contract. The measure passed 10-4. Voting yes: 
Alatorre, Mike Hernandez, Nate Holden, Rudy Svorinich Jr. Voting no: Mark 
Ridley-Thomas, Walters. Absent: Jackie Goldberg. MICHAEL KRIKORIAN

PRIME TIME OF MS. DIANE SAWYER; BIG RATINGS. RESPECT. CHARM. BEAUTY. 
CELEBRATED, LOVING HUSBAND. IS THERE ANYTHING THIS WOMAN LACKS? (DID WE MENTION 
HER $7-MILLION SALARY?) ANYWAY, LET'S ASK HER.

 Diane Sawyer walks into the hushed, elegant restaurant on Central Park South 
like a swan gliding across a glassy lake. She is effortlessly gorgeous, dressed 
all in white and cream colors that match her pale skin. But when she sits down, 
she says shyly, "I nearly tripped and fell on the way down the steps. I'm 
always walking into walls." 
</P>
<P>
 It's hard to imagine Diane Sawyer being a klutz, just as it is hard to imagine 
her being unaware of the effect of her great beauty and charm. Yet those who 
have penetrated Sawyer's carefully guarded image say that there is an 
unexpectedly vulnerable side to her, a woman who knows she is beautiful today 
but still feels like the awkward kid sister in cat-eye glasses, the one who 
still says, "I was dorky longer than I care to remember." 
</P>
<P>
 "She wears big eyeglasses and no makeup around the office, and there's 
something almost frail-looking about her," says one colleague. "But when those 
camera lights go on, man, it is magic time." That magic, combined with 
intelligence, journalistic skill and hard work, have made Sawyer, at 48, one of 
the highest paid and most powerful women in television news. To retain her 
services earlier this year amid a bidding war involving all three of its major 
network competitors, ABC ponied up a five-year contact that pays an estimated 
$7 million a year and will give her high-profile exposure on the newsmagazines 
"Turning Point" and "Day One" in addition to "PrimeTime Live," which she has 
co-anchored since 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 "The network news divisions have locked themselves into a star system that is 
like the Hollywood movie studios in the 1930s," says media critic and former 
CBS producer Jon Katz. Indeed, with newsmagazines playing an increasingly 
important role in the networks' prime-time schedules -- there were 10 on every 
week at one point last season, because they are cheaper to produce and often 
are higher rated than one-hour dramas -- marquee value has become as important 
for anchors as it is for the actors in a series or motion picture. 
</P>
<P>
 And she's got it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Diane Sawyer," ABC News President Roone Arledge explains, "is one of a 
handful of people in TV news -- like Peter Jennings, Ted Koppel or Barbara 
Walters -- who are able to make or break a franchise in news. Diane can do 
newsmagazines. She can do hard news. She's intelligent. She's a personality. 
She is someone whose presence on a news program makes a difference. It's like 
putting Michael Jordan into the game. You want to watch what she does." 
</P>
<P>
 But Sawyer herself is elusive -- and contradictory. For all her glamour, 
people who work with her say that she is one of the hardest-working anchors on 
any newsmagazine, not a star who phones it in but a serious journalist who has 
pushed "PrimeTime Live" to report on topics such as welfare reform, health care 
for women and government waste. She has a reputation for being coldly 
calculating in her career moves, but she spent hours agonizing over her 
decision about whether to stay at ABC. 
</P>
<P>
 She certainly had no shortage of suitors. NBC News President Andrew Lack 
wanted to build a "strip" of newsmagazines around Sawyer across four nights a 
week. Rupert Murdoch, seeking to build a news division for his network, wanted 
Sawyer to anchor a prime-time newsmagazine following the NFL football games he 
is bringing to Fox this fall. CBS Broadcast Group President Howard Stringer -- 
whose network lost Sawyer when Arledge wooed her away from "60 Minutes" in 1989 
-- offered a "Nightline"-style newscast for syndication -- including, sources 
say, a percentage of the profits. In fact, sources say that both the CBS and 
Fox deals involved more money than what ABC offered. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was not about the money," Sawyer said over lunch. "It was about how you're 
going to spend your working life over the next several years.  
</P>
<P>
 "Each of the networks is trying to figure out how to use the air time that we 
have on newsmagazines," she said. "I stayed at ABC to continue to work with 
Roone and other ABC executives and with the producers, correspondents and 
anchors at the network." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked whether she feels she's worth her salary, Sawyer responded, "It's not as 
if you wake up in the morning and say, 'Boy, do I deserve this!' -- because you 
know you don't. But we're in a marketplace where these salaries are paid. The 
money is there; it's like something you look at. You look in the closet door 
and say 'Oh, my' and go off and do what you've been doing for 15 years. I 
didn't get into this business for the money -- I got into it for the work." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet her work too is sometimes a contradiction. While she has won awards for 
investigative reporting, she also does interviews with celebrities and has 
jumped into the tabloid realm with interviews related to the Tonya Harding, 
O.J. Simpson and Charles Manson cases. People still remember her infamous 
question several years ago to Marla Maples on the subject of dating Donald 
Trump: "Was it the best sex you ever had?" 
</P>
<P>
 In an essay in the New York Times when Sawyer signed her contract several 
months ago, cultural critic Frank Rich wondered which would prevail: the anchor 
who has done many "diligently reported pieces" or the anchor who occasionally 
"pitches softballs" to some celebrity in the news? 
</P>
<P>
 Sawyer defends her work and says that print critics' focus on the 
"tabloid-style" stories ignores the bulk of her efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's all about balance and proportion," Sawyer said. "I do about 40 pieces a 
year on 'PrimeTime,' and 90% of them are a serious investigation of issues that 
can affect people's lives. I think critics tend to remember the 'tabloid-style' 
stories more than the work that we spend most of our time on. 'PrimeTime Live' 
has done far fewer of those stories than some other shows -- we didn't do any 
stories on Lorena Bobbit, for example. And I don't know of any major newspaper 
that wouldn't have wanted the first interview with (Harding "hit man"') Shawn 
Eckardt or O.J. Simpson's girlfriend." 
</P>
<P>
 Sawyer's question to Maples was, she said, a misunderstood, humorous takeoff 
on a headline allegedly quoting Maples in the New York Post. And she maintained 
that the interviews with Manson's female followers on "Turning Point" provided 
a cautionary tale about cult behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 Sawyer is currently working on six stories for "PrimeTime Live," ranging from 
a profile of Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg to an investigative 
piece on the environment and a look at research on the brain. The next program 
she is doing for "Turning Point" is on public policy and children, a story that 
reflects her own interest in what she calls "the consequences of neglect" of 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 "Diane Sawyer is at an interesting place in her career," says media critic 
Katz, who was executive producer of "CBS Morning News" when Sawyer worked 
there. "She can sometimes be cloying when she's interviewing another famous 
person -- she literally swooned in an interview with Mikhail Baryshnikov a few 
years ago, and I'm not sure what news came out of her interview with Boris 
Yeltsin after the Soviet coup. But she's established herself as a credible news 
authority, and 'PrimeTime Live' is one of the most serious of the 
newsmagazines." 
</P>
<P>
 S awyer's new contract calls for her to continue as co-anchor with Sam 
Donaldson on "PrimeTime Live" while also appearing on "Turning Point" and "Day 
One." "It's not as megalomaniacal as it sounds," she says. "I'm not the engine; 
I'm one of the interchangeable parts among the anchors." 
</P>
<P>
 She said she will anchor four "Turning Point" programs a year, rotating the 
duty with Jennings and Walters, and will contribute to "Day One," although that 
program is being revamped and she could wind up as a co-anchor with Forrest 
Sawyer when it returns in January.  
</P>
<P>
 The idea of spreading her and ABC's other news stars around is to create a 
unifying identity among the newsmagazines, a concept that NBC is instituting 
this fall by turning its newsmagazine "Now" into a third edition of "Dateline 
NBC," with Jane Pauley and Stone Phillips anchoring all three. 
</P>
<P>
 One factor in her decision to stay at ABC, Sawyer said, was the creation of a 
central unit to help the network's four competitive newsmagazines book guests 
without stepping on one another's toes. "What I couldn't stand was that I was 
making phone calls on stories, 'Day One' was making phone calls on stories, 
'20/20' was making phone calls -- it was crazy, taking all our time doing 
this," Sawyer said. "During the O.J. Simpson story, for example, we had 
coordination in the reporting by the newsmagazines, and it improved our 
coverage." 
</P>
<P>
 But some ABC News staffers say the concept is largely designed to help get the 
story for Sawyer, since she's got three newsmagazines behind her, and they 
wonder whether Walters will participate. In the heated competition for the 
biggest-name guests, says one ABC source, "I don't think you'll see Barbara 
Walters participating in some central booking unit." 
</P>
<P>
 Stories of personal animosity between Sawyer and Walters, the first woman to 
anchor a network evening newscast, have plagued the two over the past several 
years. In the early days of "PrimeTime Live," Walters is said to have told 
producers on "20/20," her top-rated newsmagazine, that she did not want her 
show to lose high-profile interviews to Sawyer's series. The two women have 
competed for exclusives, but both say they are friends. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our shows have been competitive for interviews," says Sawyer, "and we're 
competitive journalists. But we're respectful of each other's work, and we'd 
rather one of us get the interview than have it go to someone at CBS or NBC." 
</P>
<P>
 The daughter of a Republican judge and a homemaker who instilled her daughters 
with intellectual drive and ambition, Sawyer grew up in Louisville, Ky. She 
idealized her older sister, Linda, whose advice she still follows on clothes. 
"She was skilled and graceful at everything she did," Sawyer says admiringly. 
"She was always looking out for me. I was awkward. When we were children in the 
Christmas pageant, she was the dancing snowflake. I was the icicle, the one who 
moved stiffly around the stage." 
</P>
<P>
 After graduating from Wellesley College in 1967, Sawyer got her first job in 
TV, working as a "weather girl" at a Louisville station. "That was literally 
the only job held by a woman at the station at the time," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 After four years there, Sawyer moved to Washington, where she was hired as an 
aide to Ronald Ziegler, press secretary in the Nixon White House. "I was drawn 
to working in the government because it seemed like a chance to do things," she 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 She arrived just before the Watergate crisis and ended up becoming an in-house 
expert on White House notes and papers relating to the scandal. "Nixon was such 
an idiosyncratic character that it seemed possible at first that he might not 
have known about Watergate," Sawyer says. 
</P>
<P>
 After Nixon's resignation, Sawyer and three other aides went to California 
with Nixon to help him prepare his memoirs. She did it out of loyalty, she 
says.  
</P>
<P>
 In 1978, Bill Small, then president of CBS News, hired Sawyer to be a reporter 
in the Washington bureau, over the objections of many in the news division who 
took issue with her partisan political background. But she dispelled their 
concerns with tenacity, staking out every third-rate story she was sent on. She 
was given the State Department beat and in 1981 was named co-anchor with Bill 
Kurtis of "CBS This Morning." 
</P>
<P>
 "Diane was breathtakingly political in her early days at CBS," says former 
producer Katz. "She has always been very adept at establishing strong ties with 
management, whether it's (CBS founder William S.) Paley or Roone Arledge and 
the management at ABC. Diane understands how to maneuver the tricky waters in 
television. Ed Joyce (then president of CBS News) told me that Sawyer was in 
his office complaining about Bill Kurtis -- but Bill Kurtis was in there 
complaining about Sawyer too! Being a co-anchor with Diane is not a place for 
the lazy -- she'll out-perform you on the air and out-work you in her 
reporting." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1984, Don Hewitt, the executive producer of "60 Minutes," chose Sawyer to 
be the first female correspondent on the newsmagazine. Four years later, 
Arledge lured her to ABC with the promise of her own newsmagazine. She was 
paired with Donaldson, the aggressive White House reporter, in a teaming that 
Sawyer jokingly called "Emily Dickinson meets the Terminator." 
</P>
<P>
 The premiere was a disaster. "The studio audience seemed to be hissing us 
whenever we tried to ask a question," Sawyer recalls ruefully, "and we were 
trying to do live interviews that should not have been done live. Yes, Sam and 
I had no chemistry on the air -- but that's like saying the Muzak was not good 
on the Hindenburg." 
</P>
<P>
 Arledge, executive producer Rick Kaplan, Sawyer and Donaldson met to fix the 
show. The live-from-New-York element was quickly scrapped, producers began 
working on videotaped pieces, and Donaldson moved to Washington, where he 
remains. Under Kaplan, producer Ira Rosen and others, "PrimeTime" eventually 
developed a strong mix of correspondents and stories, including the 
hidden-camera pieces for which it has become known. 
</P>
<P>
 "Diane is the one who pushed to do exposes on televangelism, day care and 
other stories that helped establish 'PrimeTime Live,' " Kaplan says. "She ought 
to be known as a serious journalist, but because she's blond and beautiful, she 
somehow doesn't get credit for that." 
</P>
<P>
 There were rumors early on that Sawyer and Donaldson did not get along 
personally, but both say that this is not true. "I think Diane is terrific," 
Donaldson says. He says he felt that it was better for him to work out of 
Washington, his longtime base, "and it's a decision that has proved right." 
</P>
<P>
 Like other anchors, Sawyer works with producers who do the initial reporting 
on stories. But she comes up with many story ideas and is involved in every 
aspect of the piece, from interviewing to writing. Along with Phyllis McGrady, 
who succeeded Kaplan as executive producer this year when he took over "World 
News Tonight," Sawyer is said to have a great deal to say about stories and 
staffing on the show. 
</P>
<P>
 But she seems uncomfortable with the "powerful" label. "I have a lot of ideas 
and opinions, but I'm not sure my role is so central," she says. "Yes, I have 
power at the network, but so do Peter and Ted and Barbara and the executive 
producers of our programs." 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't get these jobs by being self-effacing," Katz says, "and what Diane 
has done is no different from the male anchors. Believe me, Tom Brokaw and Dan 
Rather have established close ties with management and gotten the resources 
they want for their shows." 
</P>
<P>
 I n 1986, while she was still at "60 Minutes," Sawyer met her ro mantic match 
-- in the Concorde lounge at the Paris airport. Film director Mike Nichols 
("The Graduate," "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?"), who had admired her on 
"CBS This Morning," came over and introduced himself. 
</P>
<P>
 Sawyer had put Nichols on her "wish list" of possible "60 Minutes" profiles, 
and she asked him to lunch to discuss the prospects. About six months later, 
Nichols, having separated from his third wife, called Sawyer for a date. They 
were married in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is the sunniest apocalyptic I know," Sawyer says of her husband, who is 
known for his mordant humor. 
</P>
<P>
 "She is the kindest, smartest, most beautiful woman I've known," says Nichols, 
62. "I love her entirely." 
</P>
<P>
 The pair are photographed by paparazzi whenever they appear together at a 
public event, but they are not regulars on the social circuit, preferring 
instead to be together in their Manhattan apartment or in their weekend house 
in Upstate New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Sawyer continues to make two- and three-day trips on her stories, but if their 
work schedules require lengthy periods away from home, she and Nichols arrange 
to meet. And they support each other's careers where they can. During a meeting 
with the producers and cast of Nichols' movie "Wolf," he says, "People seemed 
surprised to see Diane pouring iced tea for everybody." Meanwhile, he recently 
stood in the background while she attended a CBS affiliates conference. 
</P>
<P>
 Nichols says that he doesn't want Sawyer to change her work-life to 
accommodate him. Slowing her down, he said, "would be like taking a Ferrari to 
go shopping."

<P>
 Reveling in the arts in an atmosphere of family and community unity, the 
Summer Watts Festival celebrates its 28th edition, beginning Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Borrowing from a holiday called Kwanzaa developed by Maulana Karenga, chairman 
of the black studies department at Cal State Long Beach, this year's theme is 
"Family, Community and Culture." 
</P>
<P>
 "We thought that it was appropriate for the times and for a recommitment to 
the family and culture," said Tommy Jacquette, who has been executive director 
of the festival for 26 years. 
</P>
<P>
 The three-day event will feature art exhibits, films, fashion shows, music, 
poetry and workshops. The jazz-laced Watts Prophets, who performed at  
</P>
<P>
 the first festival, head a list of national and local musical acts. 
R&B-inflected rap group Immature and the College Boys as well as blues giant 
Harmonica Fats will perform in concerts scheduled at 4 each afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 After the last fire was put out along Charcoal Alley in 1965, the first summer 
festival surfaced in August, 1966, to honor the 34 who died in the civil 
disturbances that erupted along a six-block stretch of 103rd Street. 
</P>

VOICES / COMMENTARY ON LOCAL ISSUES, VIEWPOINTS OF RESIDENTS AND COMMUNITY

 Raquel Argomaniz, 58, of Boyle Heights is a mother of six children. Three sons 
and a daughter-in-law are Los Angeles police officers. Ramiro Jr., 35, a 
13-year veteran, and Manuel, 31, who joined in 1987, received the Medal of 
Valor, the Police Department's highest honor. A member of the Special Weapons 
and Tactics team, Ramiro was cited for his role in the capture of armed robbery 
suspects . Manuel was recognized in 1991 after rescuing a 5-year-old boy 
trapped inside a burning apartment. Roger, 23, joined the Police Department in 
1991 and recently received a commendation for saving the life of a drug 
overdose victim. Ramiro's wife, Joy, was the top female graduate from the 
Police Academy in 1984. Councilman Richard Alatorre honored the Argomaniz 
family in May for its dedication and service to the people of Los Angeles. 
Argomaniz and her husband, Ramiro Sr., have lived in Boyle Heights for the last 
39 years . She was interviewed by Kirby Lee.  
</P>
<P>
 I tried to discourage my first son from becoming a police officer. I wanted 
him to become a doctor. 
</P>
<P>
 Ever since he was a little boy, Ramiro Jr. wanted to be a cop. As soon as he 
graduated from high school, he went into the Police Academy. Ramiro Jr. was 
really determined and eventually I realized he wasn't going to change his mind 
and I decided to support him. 
</P>
<P>
 I really didn't want my second son, Manuel, to do police work. One was enough 
and I didn't want to worry about the danger involved. 
</P>
<P>
 Manuel had a very good job as a paralegal with the L.A. County Bar, but he was 
also very determined. So I decided he was old enough to make the decision and I 
would have to support it. 
</P>
<P>
 I thought after the first two joined the police, that would be it. But as soon 
as Roger turned 21, he already had it in him he was going to become a cop.  
</P>
<P>
 My other sons tried to convince him not to and that there were other careers 
to go into. I considered him the baby of the family, but once he decided to do 
it, I had no choice but to accept it. 
</P>
<P>
 I am really worried about the escalation of violence and how it affects my 
sons in their careers as police officers. 
</P>
<P>
 It's gotten worse and at times, I find it very hard to sleep. I am especially 
concerned about my 16-year-old granddaughter Laura, who says that once she 
reaches the right age she is going to join the LAPD. 
</P>
<P>
 I am very worried, but very proud of my sons. There is a perception that 
everything bad happens in East L.A. I am thankful our family was recognized by 
Councilman Alatorre, because it demonstrates there are good people in Boyle 
Heights who are concerned about their community. 
</P>
<P>
 My sons were always involved in sports and there was never any time for them 
to go out on the streets. I always stayed home and never worked for that 
reason. As a parent, I tried to counsel them and steer them in the right 
direction. 
</P>
<P>
 My husband would come home from work and take them to play baseball in the 
afternoon. They would come home and they'd be tired. They'd have dinner and go 
to sleep.  
</P>
<P>
 Our family has always been close and always is in constant communication. My 
sons usually call every day to let me know they're OK, but I begin to worry if 
I have not heard from them in awhile.  
</P>
<P>
 I have a habit of watching the 6 o'clock news to see what's going on and have 
occasionally seen them on television, especially during the riots. I never 
really ask them questions about their jobs, but when something serious happens, 
they usually volunteer to tell me what took place and how they were able to 
take care of themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 The people who suffer the most are the families of police officers, because 
the officers leave them behind to preserve justice and help other families who 
are in need of assistance. It's a responsibility, it's part of their job.

VOICES / COMMENTARY ON LOCAL ISSUES, VIEWPOINTS OF RESIDENTS AND COMMUNITY 
LEADERS, AND LETTERS.: THE MARTIAL PLAN; MARK STEWART IS ORGANIZING A SAFETY 
PATROL TO IMPROVE THE ATMOSPHERE AROUND CHINATOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By MARK STEWART

<TEXT>
<P>
 Six days a week, Mark Stewart drives from his San Fernando Valley home to 
Chinatown, where he teaches martial arts. Stewart, 34, teaches in the style of 
the famed Bruce Lee, whose movies inspired legions of youngsters to take up 
martial arts. jeet kune do is a blend of martial arts developed by Lee, and 
Stewart trained with Lee's protege. Now Stewart is offering his skills to 
better the Chinatown community. He is organizing the Chinatown Safety Patrol, a 
volunteer anti-crime group whose members will be trained in martial arts for 
free. He was interviewed by Catherine Gewertz . 
</P>
<P>
 This all started in the Chinatown Public Safety Assn., which I belong to. A 
group of us had the idea of starting a public safety patrol to deal with 
panhandlers and prevent people from breaking into cars. That's been a real 
problem in Chinatown and it keeps people from coming down there. It's dying and 
we need to make it more attractive and safer for pedestrians, residents and 
shoppers. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm in charge of getting the group going. It's called the Chinatown Safety 
Patrol. We have about six volunteers right now, all merchants in Chinatown. We 
would like about two dozen or so. It's open to men or women over 21. We'll have 
walkie-talkies and flashlights. No guns or anything like that. Volunteers who 
put in four hours a week or more will be insured while on patrol. 
</P>
<P>
 We'll walk the streets from Cesar Chavez, north to Bernard, west to Figueroa 
and south to Alameda. We will try to fill as many hours as possible, but we'll 
stagger days so no one knows when to expect us. 
</P>
<P>
 We're going to concentrate on panhandling because that has been the No. 1 
problem that has discouraged people from coming to Chinatown or staying into 
the evening. Also car break-ins and thefts. So we will keep an eye on parked 
cars, ask questions of anyone who looks like they might have locked their keys 
in their car to make sure that is exactly what happened. We'll just be there to 
help out, be out in the open so people can see us, and assist anyone who has 
day-to-day problems. 
</P>
<P>
 We're modeling ourselves after the Little Tokyo safety patrol, which has 
really cleaned up that area. We are going on patrol with them to see how they 
do it. 
</P>
<P>
 We're also meeting with the LAPD because we have to become volunteer police 
officers. They have to train us about what we can and can't do. For instance, 
we don't have arresting powers. We can persuade a panhandler, verbally, to move 
on. But anything serious we run into, we have to phone that in to the police. 
</P>
<P>
 My goal and responsibility is to do self-defense training for the volunteers. 
That's why (the Chinatown Public Safety Assn.) chose me. I will be training 
volunteers in self-defense tactics for free. I will put them into regular 
classes at my studio. We'll also have a few intensive training sessions before 
we go out. And these tactics will be put to use only if volunteers are 
attacked, only in self-defense. 
</P>
<P>
 I have been teaching in Chinatown for 2 1/2 years now. My studio, Boxer 
Rebellion, is in Central Plaza, two blocks from Lee's last school, which was on 
College Street.  
</P>
<P>
 I teach jeet kune do, or JKD for short. It isn't just one martial art, it's a 
blend. I also teach the specific arts that make it up: savate, which is French 
kick-boxing; kali, a Filipino martial art, Thai boxing and wing chun, a Chinese 
martial art. 
</P>
<P>
 I call JKD a multiracial martial art because it draws from several different 
areas of the world.  
</P>
<P>
 I started studying an Okinawan style of karate when I was 14 growing up in 
Michigan. I am now a fifth-degree black belt in karate. I wanted to study jeet 
kune do after reading about it in martial arts magazines. I saw Los Angeles was 
the mecca for it because Bruce Lee's main protege, Dan Inosanto, taught here. 
So I moved to San Diego in 1986 and commuted to L.A. to take lessons with him 
in Westchester. I moved to L.A.  
</P>
<P>
 Like any martial art, jeet kune do is a fighting system, so the point is to 
learn to defend yourself. To seek the truth in jeet kune do is to seek the most 
efficient means to defend yourself.

NOTEBOOK; BELL EARNS PASSING MARKS IN SUMMER LEAGUE TOURNAMENT

<P>
 The Bell High football team took first place in the 1994 Pepsi-Cola North 
County Passing League Tournament, held at El Camino and Rancho Buena Vista high 
schools July 29-30. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The seven-on-seven, touch football tournament fielded 25 teams, including Bell 
and Fremont. Other Southland schools competing were Riverside Poly, Oceanside, 
San Clemente, Rancho Buena Vista, Hawthorne, Hart, Canyon Country, Norte Vista, 
San Diego El Capitan and Temecula Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Bell, the only team to go undefeated throughout the tournament, beat 
Hawthorne, 28-0, San Dieguito, 28-7, and San Clemente, 35-28, in the first 
round on July 29. 
</P>
<P>
 The Eagles then moved into the championship bracket, where they defeated San 
Bernardino Los Amigos, 21-12, Riverside Poly, 52-6, Riverside Canyon Springs, 
35-21, and Escondido, 35-12, in the championship game on July 30. 
</P>
<P>
 Henry Santiago, who begins his first full season as Bell head coach after 
sharing an assistant coaching role with Ray Galarze for two years, eagerly 
anticipates the upcoming season after his team's impressive performance. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am very pleased with the results," Santiago said. "These kids have been 
working very hard in the off-season and I am very excited to take this 
(accomplishment) into the regular season." 
</P>
<P>
 Offensive stars for Bell in the competition were quarterback Gustavo 
Valenzuela, wide receivers Freddie Alcala and Gary Herrera, tight end Dickie 
Purcell and running back Vern Bernard. On defense, cornerbacks Dulio Orellana 
and Josh Moreno, free safety Freddie Hernandez, and linebackers Jesse Macias 
and Alex Rodriguez turned in stellar performances. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Switching jobs -- Randy Rodriguez has resigned as head football coach at 
Lincoln High to become the offensive coordinator at Garfield High. 
</P>
<P>
 Lincoln administrators honored the 10-year coach's wishes in the search for 
his replacement, choosing Joe Silva, a Lincoln assistant for the past three 
years and a former player under Rodriguez. 
</P>
<P>
 An All-Northern Conference lineman as a senior in 1985, Silva, 27, had applied 
for an assistant position but was stunned when he was offered the head coaching 
job despite being a walk-on. 
</P>
<P>
 "My ultimate goal was to become a head coach. The chance came sooner than I 
thought," said Silva, a plant manager at Allesandro Elementary School. "I'll do 
some of the things that Randy ran, but there will be some new ideas and new 
wrinkles."  
</P>
<P>
 Silva's staff, all walk-ons, will be entirely Lincoln alumni, including Woody 
Carrillo, a 1972 graduate who was an assistant under Rodriguez and head coach 
at Cathedral from 1991-93. 
</P>
<P>
 The remainder of Silva's staff -- his younger brother Steve, Ricky Chavarria, 
Gabe Cotero, Willie Flores and Gus Flores -- are all former Tiger players. 
</P>
<P>
 "It won't be easy as a walk-on, but all the coaches have ties to Lincoln," 
Silva said. "That's most important." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Karwasky rolls -- Cal State Los Angeles tennis coach Tina Karwasky has won the 
United States Tennis Assn.'s grass-court championships in the women's age 
35-and-over class for the second consecutive year. She defeated Marlie Buehler, 
6-1, 6-3, in the final in Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 This and that -- Clarence Scott of Fremont High placed second in the long jump 
with a leap of 22 feet, 9 inches in the intermediate boys (age 15-16) division 
in the USA Track & Field National Junior Olympics at the University of Florida. 
Ivan Gainses of Dallas won the event at 22-11 3/4. . . . Eric Scott, a wide 
receiver from Crenshaw High, has transferred to UCLA from Northwestern. He will 
sit out this season, but has three years of eligibility remaining starting in 
1995. . . . The finals of the Say No basketball classic will be held today at 
Los Angeles Trade Tech College. Women's tip-off is 1 p.m. Men's competition 
begins at 2:30 p.m. . . . The Cal State L.A. Volleyball Action camp is Aug. 
15-19 for girls and boys, grades 6-12. Cost is $99. Information: (213) 
343-3080.

BOXING; WILLIAMS BROKEN BUT UNBOWED IN VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Despite fighting with a broken hand from the fourth round on, Jeremy Williams 
of Long Beach stopped Mark Wills of Los Angeles in the sixth round of their 
California heavyweight championship bout Tuesday night at the Grand Olympic 
Auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams used a straight right hand that had Wills doubled over at the ropes 
and followed with a combination before referee Larry Rozadilla stopped the 
fight at 2:28 of the sixth of the scheduled 10-round main event.  
</P>
<P>
 Williams suffered a broken left hand in the fourth round and will be unable to 
fight for three months. However, the seriousness of the injury was not 
discovered until Wednesday, the day after the fight. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams, who improved his record to 18-1 with 15 knockouts, also had defeated 
Wills (14-14-1) in a Jan. 28 bout in Lewiston, Maine. That fight, which went 
nine rounds, ended on a technical knockout. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew I was going to beat him because I'm stronger and faster than him," 
said the 21-year-old Williams. "I have beaten him before so it wasn't a 
question about whether I was going to win." 
</P>
<P>
 The only question mark in the fight was whether Williams could continue with 
injured hands. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams, who weighed 211 pounds, injured a knuckle of his right hand while 
sparring and his left hand after hitting the head of the 225-pound Wills. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Williams: "Wills is hard-headed man. I threw a couple head shots, but the 
head shots weren't going to get him. I needed to throw straight clear shots to 
his face." 
</P>
<P>
 Williams, who was ahead on all three judges' cards when the fight was stopped, 
dropped his hands and challenged Wills to hit him in the first round. Wills, 
33, was too slow with his jab to produce an effective combination. 
</P>
<P>
 After his opponent missed with a wild left hook, Williams threw a vicious 
right uppercut that floored Wills in the second round. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams began complaining about his hands after the third round, according to 
his trainer Joe Goossen. "He told me in the corner his hands were hurting," 
Goossen said. "How do you respond to that? I told him to throw dinkers over the 
top and buzz him a couple times. Mark Wills is no pushover. He is a very 
confident guy who doesn't get knocked out easily." 
</P>
<P>
 Wills tried to drag his opponent toward the ropes, but Williams danced away 
from trouble until the fifth when he crumpled Wills with the hard right. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was ready to throw a right hand when I caught him with a right," Williams 
said. "I'm a boxer when I want to be, and a puncher when I need to be." 
</P>
<P>
 In a preliminary bout, Cory Johnson of Detroit stopped Paco Custa of Tijuana 
at 51 seconds of the 10th round. Johnson improved his record to 16-0 with four 
knockouts. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Williams-Wills fight drew a disappointing crowd of 1,250 partly because 
the show was televised by USA Network. Top Rank Boxing executive Dan Goossen 
also had only eight days to promote the bout, which was originally scheduled as 
a heavyweight double feature. On Aug. 13, Larry Donald (15-0, 12 KOs) was going 
to fight Andrew Golata (17-0, 15 KOs) in the first half of a heavyweight double 
feature. Williams and Wills were the other main event. 
</P>
<P>
 However, USA had a fight cancellation and Goossen persuaded the cable company 
to televise the Williams fight if it were moved to Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "In our minds, the show was a success because we had nearly 1,300 people and 
no one was sitting in the cheap seats," Goosssen said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Olympic has struggled to attract fans after its blockbuster reopening 
that included Oscar de la Hoya and James Toney fighting on the same card. For 
five shows, the Olympic has offered $1 specials for its lowest-priced seats, 
which is $4 less than it costs to park at the venue. (Top Rank does not own the 
concessions to the neighborhood parking structures.) 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from the reopening, one of the better-attended shows was the Zachary 
Padilla fight against Juan LaPorte, which drew 3,000 fans and was televised by 
CBS July 24. Padilla retained his World Boxing Organization junior-welterweight 
title with a 10th-round knockout. 
</P>
<P>
 "Are we happy?" Goossen said. "Yes, we're happy. Are we satisfied? No. We feel 
strongly that if we can bring in a De la Hoya or a Rafael Ruelas for a title 
fight, We can sell out the Olympic and build a following. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you give fight fans a card they want to see, they will come. We don't 
expect them to come in droves for every fight we schedule. But we do think that 
3,000 fans at every fight is within reach." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Top Rank President Bob Arum: "I'm disappointed that after our Pied Piper 
fought (De la Hoya), they didn't come flocking to our shows. But every show is 
building and we see the light." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Donald-Golota fight had to be canceled when Donald injured his back during 
a sparring session. 
</P>
<P>
 Donald is ranked fifth by the World Boxing Council and ninth by the World 
Boxing Organization. Top Rank officials also decided to reschedule the 
undercard bouts. 
</P>
<P>
 Featherweight Roberto Garcia of Oxnard (14-0, 11 KOs) and junior welterweight 
Pepe Reilly of Glendale (7-1, 6 KOs) will now be the featured fighters Aug. 27 
at the Olympic.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Johnson, ranked No. 2 by the International Boxing Federation and No. 4 by 
the WBC, will be seeking his 20th consecutive victory when he meets Narcisco 
Rodriguez of the Dominican Republic in a scheduled 12-round flyweight bout Aug. 
15 at the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson, 23, of Washington, is 20-1 with 13 knockouts. Rodriguez, 21, who is 
making his U.S. debut, is 13-0 with seven knockouts. Marco Antonio Barrera 
(31-0, 21 KOs) will be one of the featured fighters in the two 10-round 
undercard bouts. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Local amateurs Salvador Garcia, Adan Reyes, Antwene Fields and Dwain Williams 
are competing in the Junior Olympic Trials at the U.S. Olympic Training Center 
in Boulder, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
 They will spend nearly two weeks learning Olympic-style boxing techniques and 
participate in training sessions and seminars in preparation for the 2000 
Olympic Games. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia and Reyes, both of whom train at the Eddie Heredia Youth Boxing Club in 
East Los Angeles, became 1994 Junior Olympic champions for 15- and 16-year-olds 
on June 25. Reyes won the gold medal in the 112-pound division and Garcia, who 
will be a sophomore at Garfield High, won the 90-pound class. 
</P>
<P>
 Fields, a member of the Denker Recreation Center boxing program, won the 
silver medal at 95 pounds and Williams of South-Central took silver at 147 
pounds. Fields is trained by former professional Andy (The Hawk) Price and 
Williams is trained by Shadeed Suluki and is a member of the New Breed Boxing 
team. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia and Reyes will also compete in the International Golden Gloves 
tournament in Dublin, Ireland, later this month. They are trained by Chuck 
Rios.

LEROY WEEKES DIES; HELPED FOUND DREW UNIVERSITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ENRIQUE LAVIN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Leroy Randolph Weekes, a prominent obstetrician in the African American 
community for nearly 50 years and one of the leaders in the campaign to open 
Charles R. Drew University of Medicine and Science in Watts, died July 24. He 
was 81. 
</P>
<P>
 Weekes, who was also a force in the city's black business community, was 
hailed as a trailblazer who helped open the doors to the medical field for 
African Americans in South-Central. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was involved in every part of the community," said Dr. Henry Williams, a 
member of Drew's board of directors. Williams was one of five doctors, along 
with Weekes, who worked to get county money to open what is now King-Drew 
Medical Center in Watts. 
</P>
<P>
 Weekes, who lived in View Park but spent most of his time in South-Central 
developing services for the black community, died after complications from 
three strokes he suffered two months ago, said his son, Lee Randolph Weekes. He 
served four terms as chairman of Drew University's board of directors before he 
retired from the position in 1987, when he was succeeded by Dr. Willie B. 
Boone. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was a very quiet gentleman who had immense generosity and power, but it 
was always controlled. He was completely dedicated to education," said Boone, 
who met Weekes 15 years ago when the two worked for the Charles Drew Medical 
Society, the county arm of the National Medical Assn. "He always had time to 
participate in those things that would further the educational opportunities of 
undereducated populations." 
</P>
<P>
 Weekes was a professor at Drew, a teaching hospital, in the department of 
obstetrics and gynecology. He was also founder, past president and chairman of 
Ross Medical Center, where he had an office since 1954. In 1969, he was named 
the first black president of the staff at Queen of Angels Hospital, and was a 
past president of the state Board of Medical Examiners. 
</P>
<P>
 His civic and business work was also extensive. He was a member of the 
county's mental health commission; a founder of Family Savings Bank; a 
three-term president of the Los Angeles Urban League in the early 1970s, and 
founder of the Los Angeles County Medical Assn.'s Doctors' Symphony, in which 
he played the violin.  
</P>
<P>
 "Frequently physicians are criticized for not really giving back or reaching 
out to less fortunate people in the community, but Leroy Weekes was clearly a 
very caring, unselfish human being," said John Mack, executive director of the 
Los Angeles Urban League. 
</P>
<P>
 Born Jan. 17, 1913, in Atlantic City, N.J., Weekes completed his medical 
studies at Howard University in Washington, then moved to Los Angeles in 1947, 
where he started his family. 
</P>
<P>
 His dedication to community and family went hand in hand, Lee Weekes said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Often we'd go to the drive-in theater for a family outing, where he'd tell 
the attendant he was on call," said Weekes, 46, a medical administrator for 
Weekes Medical Group at Ross Medical Center. "Sure enough, as soon as the 
feature would tune in, he'd get called to deliver a baby." 
</P>
<P>
 That dedication to family and career kept patients loyal to him generation 
after generation. For the 47 years he served as a family doctor, Weekes 
delivered more than 10,000 babies, many of whom had come back as adults so that 
he could deliver their babies. 
</P>
<P>
 "My mother always took us to him over the years," said Olga Hayes, who Weekes 
delivered 43 years ago. "He was like family to us." Over 38 years, Weekes 
delivered all six of Hayes' siblings, and all of their children. 
</P>
<P>
 Weekes is survived by his wife, Silvia Means Weekes; his children Wenda Weekes 
Moore, Anita Weekes Hibler, Lee R. Weekes, Beryl Lynne Weekes and Gerald Wilson 
Weekes, and eight grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
 Funeral services were July 30 at Holman United Methodist Church. Memorial 
contributions can be made to the Leroy R. Weekes Foundation, 1828 S. Western 
Ave., No. 1, Los Angeles, 90006. 
</P>
<P>
 The foundation provides financial support for historically black medical 
schools.

SHIP BRINGS GOOD TIDINGS; AFTER OVERCOMING A BIT OF A LANGUAGE BARRIER, BRITISH 
SAILORS GIVE YOUTHS A TASTE OF THE SEA-FARING LIFE AND A SENSE OF THE WORLD 
BEYOND CENTRAL LOS ANGELES. 
</P>

<P>
 Eleven-year-old Lashon Jennings of South-Central isn't exactly sure where 
Britain is. But after a tour of the HMS Lancaster, she knows that people who 
come from there speak a language remarkably close to hers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I liked the control rooms and the computers," Lashon said as she and nine 
other children and young adults from Central Los Angeles neighborhoods recently 
took a tour of the Royal Navy frigate at Long Beach Naval Station. "And (the 
British sailors) were nice. But they talk a little funny." 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, they don't think so. It may come as a shock to Lashon and her 
friends that the British sailors think she's the one who speaks oddly. 
</P>
<P>
 "The accent here is a bit funny, isn't it?" said Leading Marine Engineer Dez 
(Scouse) Stanley, 24, of Liverpool after he finished showing the youths some 
shipboard firefighting gear. 
</P>
<P>
 But despite being separated by a common language, as British playwright George 
Bernard Shaw once said of Britain and America, the American kids and the 
British sailors -- some of whom weren't much older than the kids -- seemed to 
enjoy the visit, which was designed to broaden the youths' horizons beyond the 
sometimes rough neighborhoods where they live. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are at-risk kids because of the neighborhoods they live in," said Los 
Angeles County Sheriff's Department Deputy Pat Lyons, who brought three girls 
from the Lennox Sheriff's Youth Activity League to the ship for the tour. "You 
do whatever you can to show them that there's more to the world than 
South-Central L.A." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's something I imagine they don't get to see every day," said Russell 
Merriott, 21, an operator-maintainer from Taunton in Somerset, as he directed 
the kids through the ship's bridge. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The visit to the Lancaster was arranged by the British Consulate in Los 
Angeles and by the Los Angeles FBI office, which invited youths from the 
Sheriff's Explorers program and the Youth Activity League. The 405-foot 
Lancaster, launched in 1990, is making a show-the-flag visit to Long Beach 
Naval Station as part of an eight-month voyage that included working with the 
U.S. Coast Guard on drug-smuggling interdiction in the Caribbean. The Lancaster 
is the first British warship to visit the Los Angeles area in four years. 
</P>
<P>
 The tour took the local youths -- most of whom had never been on a ship 
before, and certainly not a British warship -- from bow to stern and bridge to 
engine room, with guides from among the ship's 185-man crew. Although women 
serve on British naval ships, said Cmdr. Mark Sloan, the Lancaster's captain, 
none has yet been assigned to the Lancaster. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything is pretty interesting," said William Bonilla, 18, of Montebello, a 
Sheriff's Explorer. "It's the first time I've ever been on a ship. I'm getting 
some information about maybe joining the Navy -- the U.S. Navy." 
</P>
<P>
 "It was great, I liked it a lot," Rick Gonzalez, 18, of Lynwood said of the 
ship tour. "I understood (the British sailors) pretty well. At first I was 
like, 'What? Excuse me?' but after awhile I understood them OK. It was cool." 
</P>
<P>
 By that he means, of course, "jolly good."

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTHEAST: SOUTHEAST AREA; DONATION BEARS FRUIT FOR SENIORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SIMON ROMERO

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In an effort to bring attention to the poor nutritional habits and medical 
needs among the elderly, a massive donation of fresh fruit was made last week 
to more than 5,000 senior citizens. Bags of fresh peaches and nectarines were 
distributed to community centers throughout the day. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty tons of fruit were donated by San Joaquin Valley peach and nectarine 
growers in conjunction with the nonprofit Fresno Food Bank. The food bank 
arranged to have the fruit sorted, bagged and delivered to Southern California. 
Qwik Way Trucking of Vernon donated transportation for the local distribution. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not every day we get such a treat," said Juanita Mansilia, 79, one of 
about 100 fruit recipients at the Bonelli Senior Center in Huntington Park. 
"Far more of this fruit is needed if we're to remain healthy and active." 
</P>
<P>
 Sal Gonzales, director of the Fresno Food Bank, said this is the start of a 
mutually beneficial relationship between Southern California senior citizen 
groups, the food bank and valley growers.  
</P>
<P>
 Senior citizen groups from Artesia, Bell, Bell Gardens, Cudahy, Hawaiian 
Gardens, Huntington Park, Lynwood, Maywood and South Gate participated at 
community centers, where thousands of the elderly participate in state-funded 
supplemental meal programs. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are about 1.5 million seniors living in Los Angeles County, and an 
estimated 130,000 are living below the poverty line," said Sandy Stanko, 
project director for the Oldtimers Foundation, which regularly distributes food 
at the Huntington Park center. The foundation, established in 1964, serves 
nearly 750,000 meals annually to the elderly in Los Angeles and San Bernardino 
counties at nutrition sites as well as to those who are homebound. Gonzales 
said that fruit distribution programs provide growers an outlet for edible 
fruit that may not be marketable "due to low prices or because the fruit is 
blemished, misshapen or too ripe to transport long distances to market." 
</P>
<P>
 Programs are in place throughout the state, he said, to distribute fresh fruit 
to schools, nonprofit groups and charitable organizations.  
</P>
<P>
 The Fresno Food Bank aims to establish ties with other urban organizations 
that can distribute their perishable product, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "While we don't have a problem accessing fruit, we do have problems arise due 
to limited resources such as manpower and transportation," he said. SIMON

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTHEAST: SOUTH GATE; FOUNDRY TO CLOSE; 67 WILL LOSE JOBS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Sixty-seven jobs will vanish at month's end when the Universal Cast Iron 
Manufacturing Co., a fixture in the Southeast's industrial landscape since 
1946, closes down, company officials said last week. The plant, which produces 
cast-iron plumbing fittings and couplings, has distributed and sold its 
products under the brand name UNIVCO. 
</P>
<P>
 Located on 7.4 acres near the Los Angeles River, Universal's plant is part of 
an estate controlled by the family of Albert Levinson, who died in 1992. 
According to Ray Javier, Universal's chief financial officer, the company has 
been losing money since 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very tough nowadays to run a foundry," said Javier, "and even tougher to 
sell one." The nation has only seven cast-iron foundries left, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 According to City Manager Todd Argow, who has been involved in the effort to 
save Universal, Levinson's family does not want to operate the business any 
longer. For the fiscal year ending June 30, 1993, Universal had $14 million in 
sales, according to Javier, but the plant lost more than $1 million last year 
alone. The loss in city tax revenue will be negligible, Argow said, since 
Universal was not a retail outlet. 
</P>
<P>
 The family tentatively agreed last September to sell Universal to Jones 
Plumbing Systems of Birmingham, Ala., according to a statement released by 
Douglas Bess, Jones' chief financial officer. The agreement entitled Jones to 
purchase all of Universal's property and tangible assets. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Jones spokeswoman Kim Nolan, the purchase agreement was 
terminated in November. Nolan declined to say why Jones changed its plans. 
</P>
<P>
 Universal's closing reflects a countywide trend over the past two decades, in 
which about 300 industries and factories have left the Los Angeles Basin, 
according to statistics compiled by UCLA's Lewis Center and the Graduate School 
of Architecture and Urban Planning. More than 50,000 jobs in relatively 
high-wage, largely unionized industries have disappeared or moved elsewhere due 
to competition and lower operating costs abroad or in other states. Some of 
those jobs have been replaced by the growing durable manufacturing sector, 
which includes apparel cutting, furniture-making, printing operations, plastic 
laminators and sewing shops. 
</P>
<P>
 Javier said there are no plans to convert Universal's facilities into other 
operations. SIMON ROMERO

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTHEAST: HUNTINGTON PARK; AIDS PATIENT'S SUIT ACCUSES 
MCDONALD'S 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SIMON ROMERO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A former Huntington Park resident who was HIV-positive has filed a lawsuit 
against a local McDonald's, claiming that food poisoning he allegedly 
contracted there accelerated his illness into full-blown AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 Jury selection is scheduled to begin next month in Los Angeles Superior Court 
in the suit filed by Arvin Peterson, 49, now of Seattle, who claims that his 
immune system rapidly deteriorated after eating a meal at the McDonald's outlet 
at 2584 E. Slauson Ave. on March 9, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit, which seeks unspecified damages, says that Peterson vomited and 
suffered 20 to 30 bouts of severe diarrhea after eating a McRib sandwich, 
french fries, ice cream and a soft drink. Peterson was taken the next day by 
ambulance to the emergency room of Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, where he was 
diagnosed with shigella, a bacterial infection that can be transmitted through 
contaminated food. 
</P>
<P>
 Peterson's attorney, Natasha Roit, said Peterson, who is gay, did not have any 
other meals that day. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokeswoman for the corporate offices of McDonald's said she was not 
familiar with the suit and declined to comment. Michael Thomas, an attorney for 
the McDonald's branch named in the suit, contended that Peterson contracted 
shigella because he is gay, not because of the food he consumed. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a higher incidence among homosexuals to contract shigella because of 
their lifestyle," said Thomas in a phone interview.  
</P>
<P>
 Lee Klosinski, program manager for HIV prevention and education at AIDS 
Project Los Angeles, disputed Thomas' statement. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's ridiculous for the defense to suggest that the fact he (Peterson) is gay 
is why he got shigella," said Klosinski. "I expect more from McDonald's." 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Jonathan Kaplan, an AIDS specialist at the Centers for Disease Control in 
Atlanta, said, "It's questionable how much more HIV-positive people get 
shigella than other parts of the population." The disease, he said, is most 
commonly transmitted through exposure to fecal matter. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Gary Cohan, an assistant professor of medicine at UCLA and an HIV 
specialist, said shigella is not "classically considered" to be a sexually 
transmitted disease, but that it could be spread through oral-anal contact. It 
still isn't known if a person who is HIV-positive and contracts shigella gets 
AIDS faster, said Cohan. "Forty percent of the people with AIDS may carry 
infectious organisms like shigella," said Cohan, citing a 1988 study on the 
subject. 
</P>
<P>
 Peterson's argument in the suit hinges on the claim that the bacteria was 
passed on by a restaurant employee who was not wearing gloves. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas claims that the McRib sandwich that allegedly caused Peterson's illness 
was cooked in an acidic sauce that would have killed the shigella bacteria, and 
that the heat from cooking would also have destroyed it. 
</P>
<P>
 While hospitalized, Peterson suffered heart fibrillations and his T-cell count 
-- which reflects the health of the body's immune system -- dropped from 
between 500 and 600 to 160, the suit says. A T-cell count below 200 indicates 
that a person has AIDS, according to Dean Licitra, director of communications 
for AIDS Project L.A. Peterson's attorney said he was hospitalized for several 
days during his illness. 
</P>
<P>
 Following an inspection conducted by the Los Angeles County Health Department 
as a result of Peterson's illness, the McDonald's in question was cited for 
food preparation violations, as well as refuse and lavatory violations. Among 
citations issued in subsequent investigations were a failure to provide a probe 
thermometer for periodic testing of hot foods, cockroach infestation and 
failure to provide approved containers and covers for food storage. SIMON

<P>
 In hues of purple and red, the Harriet and Charles Luckman Fine Arts Complex 
at Cal State Los Angeles is being readied for the opening of the new school 
year, when it will be the site of the faculty's first meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 The complex, which houses a 1,200-seat theater, an art gallery, a small 
amphitheater and another, smaller theater, has been in the planning and 
building stages for about eight years. Mostly private funds have gone into the 
$23-million complex, with the Luckmans donating $2.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Its challenge, said Executive Director Clifford D. Harper, is to meet the 
artistic needs of the diverse community of Cal State L.A. as well as the 
surrounding neighborhoods and to introduce the school's neighbors to 
performances that would otherwise be staged at the Hollywood Bowl, the Ahmanson 
Theatre and the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to appeal to our communities which are not focused on the arts as we 
know them," Harper said. "There is obviously something out there that those 
communities do that focus on the arts. We have to bridge that or join that in 
some way." 
</P>
<P>
 In attempting to bridge those gaps, Harper and his staff will focus on 
educating the public on the lineup of scheduled events and how tickets can be 
purchased for a series of performances or a whole season. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, workers are putting the finishing touches on the theater complex. A 
walkway through the complex -- with its rust-colored arches and circular design 
-- will link the parking structures to the rest of the campus. An 800-space 
parking garage just north of the theater complex is to be built to accommodate 
student vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
 The main theater, with its Art Deco lighting fixtures and mauve carpeting, 
contains the city's largest stage -- 48 by 52 feet deep -- complete with an 
elevator-lift orchestra pit and eight stories of fly space for the scenery. 
</P>
<P>
 Backstage are a rehearsal room with a wood floor that has the identical 
dimensions of the main stage, a costume room and men's and women's dressing 
rooms with 32 dressing tables each. 
</P>
<P>
 The orchestra warm-up room is under the main stage. 
</P>
<P>
 For smaller performances, a mesh curtain can close off the balcony to cut 
seating to 700. Another set of curtains, designed so sound can travel through 
them without changing the quality, can close off two sections of the main 
auditorium to pare seating to 500 while not affecting the auditorium's 
acoustics. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the inaugural gala is not until Nov. 10, several events have been 
scheduled at the facility. The Fall Faculty Day on Sept. 19 will welcome back 
the faculty and honor outstanding professors. On Oct. 2, the UK/LA Festival 
will feature a performance by the Phoenix Dance Co.. And toward the end of 
October, the theater of Yugen from Japan will appear.  
</P>
<P>
 "We'll have educational programs that will entice that community to use the 
facility for their purposes and bring their children so they become accustomed 
to coming to the theater," said Harper, who served for seven years as the 
chairman of the university's Theater Arts and Dance Department.  
</P>
<P>
 "The beauty of this is this arts facility is in the community and we are in a 
tremendous community," Harper said. MARY ANNE PEREZ

 State engineers permanently closed the Psychiatric Hospital at County-USC

the Jan. 17 Northridge earthquake. 
</P>

 Inspectors found serious damage to the support columns and shear walls of the 
166-bed, eight-story hospital, spokesman Harvey Kern said.Although some office 
workers have been in the building since the quake, all patients were moved out 
that morning. 
</P>
<P>
 Workers will shore up the building temporarily so equipment and furniture can 
be moved out. 
</P>

 "The cost of staying there would have been prohibitive. They figure it would 
take about $50 million for repairs and to bring the building up to code," Kern 
said.

<P>
 AltaMed Health Services has established a toll-free number for seniors to 
receive transportation, home-delivered meals and other health and social 
services.  
</P>
<P>
 The nonprofit community health care organization received a grant of $210,355 
through the Los Angeles County Area Agency on Aging under the Federal Older 
Americans Act to increase the number of frail elderly it serves.The efforts to 
coordinate services for seniors over 60 will target those who live in East Los 
Angeles, Monterey Park, Montebello and Whittier. Income is not a factor in 
qualifying for the services. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really critical," said Marie Torres, vice president of long-term care at 
AltaMed. "There are a lot of older people out there and they're not being 
served." 
</P>
<P>
 The additional funding will increase AltaMed's case management from 600 
seniors a month to 800. Also, AltaMed expects to help 1,200 seniors a month 
through its 800 number. The hotline, (800) 270-0633, operates from 8 a.m. to 
4:30 p.m. Monday through Friday and is staffed by speakers of English, Spanish, 
Cantonese, Mandarin, Vietnamese and Korean.  
</P>
<P>
 AltaMed has also increased the number of elderly it serves with the opening of 
a center in Boyle Heights which includes a daytime health program for seniors.

<P>
 Residents of the Marengo Heights neighborhood received letters last week 
asking them to meet with appraisers to start the process of making way for 
construction of the new hospital at County-USC Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials conducted workshops Tuesday and July 30 for home and business owners 
and will schedule another meeting for renters. About 25 attended both meetings, 
which were designed for residents on Cummings, Marengo and Chicago streets and 
Zonal Avenue who will be affected by the project's first phase. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've heard rumors about us only paying 60% of the property value or that you 
can only relocate in a certain area," said Nancy Manzanares, project 
administrator for the county Community Development Commission. "We're holding 
these workshops to stop the rumors."  
</P>
<P>
 At Tuesday's meeting at the County Department of Health Services, 2032 Marengo 
St., some homeowners said they were concerned about whether the home appraisals 
would be fair. The county promises the "fair market value" of their property.  
</P>
<P>
 "We have maintained our property well but whatever they offer us will not 
include what we have already paid on the house," said Salvador Ramirez, who 
attended the meeting with his wife, Yolanda. They have lived in their home on 
Chicago Street for seven years.  
</P>
<P>
 Ramirez said he was concerned that the move will force him to start all over 
on a mortgage on a new home. Manzanares and other county officials assured him 
that they will look into a shorter-term mortgage or a reduced interest rate so 
the years the Ramirezes have paid on their current home are not lost in the 
process. 
</P>
<P>
 The County Board of Supervisors approved $20.7 million in July to initiate the 
first phase of buyouts and build an eight-story parking garage. This week 
workers will begin clearing out a recently vacated lot south of Marengo Street 
to start construction on the parking garage. They will also begin tearing down 
the AIDS outpatient clinic, which will be moved to the north side of the 
hospital at Mission Road and Zonal Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 All this represents the first phase of the county's effort to replace General 
Hospital and consolidate other hospitals into one 2.1-million-square-foot 
building. The $1.1-billion construction project is to be completed in 2002. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents east of County-USC will have about 10 months to review appraisals of 
their homes, accept offers and find new homes. Demolition is not expected until 
all the residents who live in the first-phase construction zone have moved out, 
Manzanares said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know this is a real difficult task for you," Carlos Jackson, executive 
director of the Community Development Commission, told the audience. "The 
hospital is a very important project and you are important to us. What we 
promise is we really want to work closely with you. We want to make this as 
comfortable as possible. No one's going to lose on this." MARY ANNE PEREZ

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTH: SOUTH-CENTRAL; PROTESTERS WANT '3 STRIKES' LAW OUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ENRIQUE LAVIN

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dressed in mock prison uniforms and lugging fake balls and chains along South 
Central Avenue, a teen-aged "chain gang" led about 100 youths last week in a 
peaceful march and rally against the state "three strikes and you're out" law. 
</P>
<P>
 Chanting "Hey, hey, ho, ho, 'three strikes' has got to go!" the protesters 
called for the exclusion of juvenile felonies from the law, which mandates 
offenders with two serious or violent felonies to face 25-year to life prison 
sentences if convicted of a third felony. The law went into effect in March. 
</P>
<P>
 "People who think that by building prisons (they) fight crime must also think 
that building cemeteries is necessary to fight AIDS!" shouted Tony Zepeda, an 
18-year-old recent Jefferson High graduate to a crowd assembled Wednesday at 
the Police Department's Kenyon Juvenile Justice Center. 
</P>
<P>
 The march began at Welcome Baptist Church at South Central Avenue and 76th 
Street, where the protesters warmed up with slogans such as "Three mistakes is 
all it takes. . . . Three strikes, takes your life." 
</P>
<P>
 Protesters moved up Central Avenue passing out flyers to residents and 
merchants. In a show of solidarity, passing drivers honked their horns and 
stopped to pick up information. 
</P>
<P>
 The midafternoon rally was organized by South Central Youth Empowered Thru 
Action, an arm of the Community Coalition for Substance Abuse Prevention. The 
coalition contends that the cost to incarcerate teen-agers costs the same as 
sending them to an elite university.  
</P>
<P>
 "This is just one of the steps we are doing in order to reach a full-blown 
educational campaign," said Karen Bass, executive director of the substance 
abuse organization, as she passed out flyers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because there has been horrific crime, there doesn't have to be sweeping 
social policies," she said. "There should be policy to prevent social problems. 
We know who is going to jail. It isn't the white middle-class male. Look at the 
statistics." 
</P>
<P>
 Bass contends that the law is racist since the majority of the adults and 
youngsters who are convicted are black or Latino. 
</P>
<P>
 According to 1992 California Department of Justice statistics, 28% of felony 
charges statewide were filed against blacks and 31.6% of blacks convicted were 
sent to prison. In addition, 33.8% of felony charges were filed against 
Latinos, and 37.2% of Latinos convicted went to prison. Statewide, 34.3% of 
felony charges were filed against whites, and 28.9% of whites convicted were 
sent to prison. 
</P>
<P>
 "As a general rule this (law) impacts more minorities," said police Officer 
John Harris outside the juvenile center. "People are less inclined to hire 
minorities, so they are more apt to get in trouble -- and subsequently they end 
up in jail." 
</P>
<P>
 Darl Corner, a 17-year-old Washington High student, said the policy affects 
teen-agers he knows who have been convicted of felonies: "I experience a lot of 
crime in the community. But I get more harassment by police than by gang 
members walking down the street." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard living here in South-Central. Most gang-member kids come from 
one-parent families, whose mothers can't give them so much attention." 
</P>
<P>
 Corner said because South-Central families face so many day-to-day struggles, 
youths who can't get jobs turn to crime. "If a brother sees something he wants, 
he's going to get it. The homeboys want jobs, but there's no jobs out there." 
</P>
<P>
 Community elders such as the Rev. Algie F. Rousseau of the 105th St. Christian 
Church in South-Central and Davis L. Rogers, president of the Watts Branch 
NAACP, marched alongside the black and Latino youths in support. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need people to look at the impact," Rousseau said. "In an attempt to solve 
the problem (by enacting 'three strikes'), we may be creating greater 
problems." ENRIQUE LAVIN

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTHWEST: BALDWIN HILLS; SCIENCE PROGRAM TARGETS BLACK YOUTHS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIN J. AUBRY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hal and Bettye Walker believe that for black children to seize control of 
their futures, they must shoot for the moon. 
</P>
<P>
 The Walkers are not speaking metaphorically. 
</P>
<P>
 The retired laser scientist and his wife, an educator, say black children must 
be educated about not only space travel, but the fast-moving world of science 
and technology that has brought about everything from space shuttles to laser 
disc players. 
</P>
<P>
 It is the lack of emphasis within the black community on such knowledge, the 
Baldwin Hills couple say, that prompted them to recently open the Science and 
Discovery Learning Center at 3639 La Brea Ave. Through discussion, reading and 
lab work, the Walkers aim to demystify science for black youngsters and make it 
as real to them as Nintendo. 
</P>
<P>
 Hal Walker Jr., who developed laser equipment for Hughes Aircraft that 
projected images of the moon back to the Earth during the 1969 Apollo moonwalk, 
says it is time that blacks focus on the importance of science to their 
progress as a people. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe that we have to pursue using technology as a solution to social 
problems," said Walker, 60, who is being honored with an exhibit at the 
Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of American History in Washington 
that commemorates the moonwalk. The Baldwin Hills Crenshaw Plaza also is 
honoring him with an exhibit. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're breaking from black grass-roots traditions by not emphasizing giving 
people jobs to survive. This is about building an information base we haven't 
historically had." 
</P>
<P>
 Bettye Walker, a retired teacher and educator with the Compton and Los Angeles 
school districts, echoed her husband's conviction that the key to the future is 
involvement in technological advancements. 
</P>
<P>
 "The answer to all our troubles is technology. We have to make technologists," 
she said. "And we have to start doing it early." 
</P>
<P>
 At the center, an airy five-room office space, children can learn how to use a 
computer, assemble simple robots, participate in roundtable scientific 
discussions and watch a slide show on the properties of laser light. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is good because it'll help me become an inventor," said 8-year-old Benar 
Arlain, outfitted in a red center T-shirt emblazoned with the slogan "Passing 
the Torch." "I like science. I know a lot of guys who want to be in this." 
</P>
<P>
 For now, the more than two dozen participants are all boys between the ages of 
4 and 17, members of the African-American Male Achievers Network (A-Man), a 
nonprofit mentoring group formed two years ago by the Walkers that is a 
continuation of a pilot black mentoring project funded by UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 The activities of the group took a scientific turn last year when, during a 
trip to the U.S. Space Camp in Florida, Hal Walker realized virtually no black 
youths were participating except for the A-Man group traveling with him and 
Bettye. 
</P>
<P>
 "It really got their attention, especially the simulators that had them 
walking on the moon, moving through zero gravity," Hal Walker recalled. "It 
makes such a difference in interest level when you can see things close up. I 
thought: 'We need to make our own camp.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The newly acquired space on La Brea, between the shuttered Baldwin Theater 
Complex and a mini-mall, practically fell out the sky: the couple were 
searching for an office after having to vacate temporary quarters at King-Drew 
Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 At Bettye Walker's behest, the La Brea property owner agreed to give them the 
space rent-free for three months, saving the Walkers $6,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple hope to generate enough corporate and community interest to keep 
the office. All of their office furniture, scientific equipment and computers 
were donated.  
</P>
<P>
 All of this, they say, is not so much to groom technology wizards as to expose 
a generation of black children to air that is too often perceived as rarefied. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look, we're not looking to create 1,000 scientists," said Hal Walker. "Just 
one. But the key thing is getting the young people to spread the word."

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTHWEST: CRENSHAW; COFFEE FRANCHISE IS PERK FOR COMMUNITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIN J. AUBRY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It is a phenomenon that took hold first in the Fairfax district, Hollywood and 
other points west: a gourmet coffee operation that sells 40 kinds of joe and an 
array of breads, muffins, bean grinders and paraphernalia for the coffee 
connoisseur. 
</P>
<P>
 But ensconced in Baldwin Hills Crenshaw Plaza, widely considered by corporate 
types to be part and parcel of South-Central, entrepreneur Eric Wilson sees his 
coffee business as nothing less than a moral victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson, 37, said he encountered resistance from several coffee store 
franchisers before Michigan-based Coffee Beanery Ltd. gave him the go-ahead to 
open an outlet in April, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 That was a year after Wilson witnessed the devastation of the riots and 
decided to get serious about starting a business that could stimulate the local 
economy by catering to the well-heeled denizens of Baldwin Hills, Windsor 
Hills, View Park and Ladera Heights. 
</P>
<P>
 Franchisers "told me that there was just no market for gourmet coffee in this 
area," said Wilson, busily serving customers at his large, airy kiosk set 
beneath the mall's towering skylight. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I was determined. I thought, 'Why should I have to drive somewhere out of 
the neighborhood to get a good cup of coffee?' I have a lot of friends who are 
into whole beans and have espresso machines. It was time to do this." 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Robertson, director of franchising development for the Coffee Beanery, 
said he agreed with Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 "We felt that some people's reluctance to open in L.A. was absolutely wrong," 
he said. "The store -- and Eric -- has been a very good asset to us. It's doing 
very well." 
</P>
<P>
 The Coffee Beanery operates three other outlets in the South Bay and on the 
Westside. 
</P>
<P>
 The Coffee Beanery offers a range of flavored coffees, from Hawaiian hazelnut 
to German chocolate to African coffees, as well as scones, cakes, biscotti and 
other sweets. 
</P>
<P>
 For Baldwin Hills resident and coffee aficionado Cheryl Tyers, the relief the 
Beanery provides is sweet indeed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I come here three or four times a week," said Tyers as she ordered her usual: 
black coffee with a shot of Irish cream syrup. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm so happy it's here. I was dying. . . . I had to go to the marina for 
this. I think people are finally realizing that black people like the finer 
things in life too." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson says his business is holding steady, though it is not as strong as he 
would like. Bean sales account for about 17% of sales instead of the 30% that 
makes for a more comfortable profit margin. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, he says, the community support has been overwhelming. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people ask me if the place is black-owned and they're pleasantly 
surprised when I tell them yes," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 "They ask, 'Are you doing OK?' and buy two cups of cappuccino instead of one. 
They do what they can to support me. So I want to stay. . . . I'm trying to 
make a difference." ERIN J. AUBRY

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTHWEST: WEST ADAMS; STOP-IN CENTER GIVES ACCESS TO POLICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Wilshire Division of the Police Department has opened a police-community 
stop-in center at 4012 Washington Blvd. 
</P>
<P>
 The Washington Square facility is intended to improve community access to not 
only Los Angeles police officers, but also school district and Metropolitan 
Transit Authority officers.They will all use the centrally located center to do 
administrative work, take police reports on site and provide the public with 
general information and referrals. 
</P>
<P>
 The center will also be used for community events such as Neighborhood Watch 
meetings and after-school activities, said Harvard Heights Assn. member Harold 
Smith. 
</P>
<P>
 The 2,200-square-foot center has kitchen facilities for use by the police 
officers, citizen volunteers and community members using the facility. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith said the center will allow officers to spend more time in the community 
because they will be able to do paperwork in the neighborhood rather than at 
police headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 The center is a joint effort among local residents, business owners and area 
Neighborhood Watch groups.

COMMUNITY NEWS: MID-CITY: RAMPART AREA; A PEACEFUL NIGHT OUT FOR CITY CHILDREN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE BERESTEIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Surrounded by hundreds of people brandishing anti-crime slogan banners and 
picket signs, a group of children peered out curiously from underneath an 
enormous orange banner decorated with multicolored handprints, reading: "North 
Coronado Terrace Kids' Neighborhood Watch." 
</P>
<P>
 "I couldn't get their parents to come, but I got the kids," said Cristina 
Goyen, supporting one end of the banner as she kept a watchful eye on her 
wards, who ranged in age from 5 to 12 years old. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with members of at least 60 other community groups, Goyen and her 
companions were among the thousands who participated Tuesday evening in the 
first citywide observance of National Night Out. 
</P>
<P>
 Marches originated from several points throughout the Mid-City area and 
culminated in front of the Police Department's Rampart Division headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 As they munched on hot dogs and pasta in front of the station while rap groups 
played and the Goodyear blimp circled overhead, community group members 
discussed how they are trying to clean up their neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 Involving children in activities to keep them off the streets, most agreed, is 
important to saving their communities in the long run.  
</P>
<P>
 "This is the future," said Goyen, motioning toward her group of youngsters, 
whom she oversees on Saturday litter patrols and Wednesday arts and crafts 
workshops.  
</P>
<P>
 "Gang activity in this neighborhood is very strong," she said. "They recruit 
kids this age." 
</P>
<P>
 Giggling among his friends, 10-year-old Manuel Dominguez chimed in with his 
own description of what he and his fellow neighborhood watch members get out of 
their activities: "They teach us not to do drugs, or be cholos, or do bad 
things." 
</P>
<P>
 A few yards away near the stage, Paul and Joan Gamberg of the Upper Rampart 
Heights Neighborhood Watch chatted with Albert Crnkovich, a Westlake retiree 
who regularly volunteers to paint out graffiti and pick up litter in his 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Crnkovich was on his way to ask the event's organizers whether he should don 
his McGruff the Crime Dog suit -- something he does regularly at area schools 
-- to entertain the children in the audience.  
</P>
<P>
 "Rampart is really starting to hop," said Paul Gamberg, straining his voice to 
be heard above a nearby stereo speaker. "There's some fusion going on, and less 
confusion." 
</P>
<P>
 One of the purposes served by neighborhood rallies, Gamberg said, is a chance 
for people to network, to familiarize themselves with the cleanup efforts other 
community members are undertaking. 
</P>
<P>
 "You work around here for a few years and you begin to know who's who," he 
said. "Back in 1991, we began connecting the dots. Now we're starting to 
identify resources." 
</P>
<P>
 On the other side of the stage, Manuel Recinos watched the carnival-like 
festivities with amusement. Recinos is a volunteer soccer coach for about 40 
children and teens from Westlake, Pico-Union and South-Central who belong to an 
after-school gardening and sports program sponsored by St. Vincent Medical 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Recinos said rallies are good for the community's morale but more after-school 
and weekend youth programs are really needed. 
</P>
<P>
 "The police should seek more volunteers trained in things such as sports, so 
that they can help the community by teaching kids," he said. "It's the kids 
that matter." 
</P>
<P>
 Taking neighborhood youths to plant and tend crops at the medical center's 
community garden three times a week and then rewarding them with soccer games 
is one way in which Recinos, program coordinator Victor Hercules and other 
volunteers believe they can benefit the community in the long run. 
</P>
<P>
 The medical center's program has become so popular, Recinos said, that 
volunteers sometimes have difficulty shuttling all the kids to the garden, the 
games and their respective homes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lots of times, I don't have a chance to eat," he said. "I come home at 10, 
after dropping them all off in the van. But that's OK, because I'm helping 
create a better future." LESLIE BERESTEIN

COMMUNITY NEWS: MID-CITY: WESTLAKE; PLAN PUTS EMPHASIS ON HOUSING, RETAIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE BERESTEIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Better housing, increased retail opportunities and added recreational space 
are among the goals of a preliminary plan the Community Redevelopment Agency 
approved last week. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan was submitted to the agency two months ago by the Westlake Community 
Advisory Committee, appointed in November by 1st District City Councilman Mike 
Hernandez to help develop revitalization strategies for what is considered one 
of the city's poorest and most overcrowded zones.  
</P>
<P>
 "Westlake has been termed the most densely populated neighborhood west of 
Manhattan Island," said Tom Coyle, a local property owner who is co-chairman of 
the advisory committee. "We've got a lot of catching up to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the plan is likely to undergo several revisions as it passes from the 
redevelopment agency to the City Planning Department and on to the City Council 
for a final vote, Coyle said the committee has tried to address many of the 
community's problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Priorities include upgrading the area's aging and often under-maintained 
housing stock, as well as attracting more retail outlets to stimulate commerce, 
developing green space and recreational programs for youths, and improving the 
accessibility of public transit for area residents, most of whom do not own 
cars, Coyle said. 
</P>
<P>
 Attracting pedestrian-friendly commerce, Coyle said, plays perhaps the most 
important role in revitalizing the area. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a large population, densely packed, with limited retail resources. The 
retail opportunity just isn't there, compared with slightly better-off suburban 
neighborhoods," he said. "At this time, I only know of one household 
electronics store in the area; five others were burned out in the (1992) 
riots." 
</P>
<P>
 According to Maxine Chavez, the redevelopment agency's project manager for 
Westlake and Pico-Union, the City Council recently approved $214,000 in 
riot-recovery funds to go toward the services of an environmental consultant, 
who will work with the agency, city officials and the redevelopment agency to 
prepare an environmental impact report for the proposed redevelopment zone.  
</P>
<P>
 Chavez said the redevelopment plan should be submitted to the City Council for 
approval no later than May, coinciding with the projected completion date of 
the environmental impact report. 
</P>
<P>
 The area being considered for redevelopment is bounded roughly by 3rd Street 
and Beverly Boulevard on the north, Olympic Boulevard on the south, Bixel 
Street, Columbia Avenue and Garland Avenue on the east, and Hoover Street on 
the south. LESLIE BERESTEIN

COMMUNITY NEWS: CENTRAL: DOWNTOWN; ADULT THEATER MUST FOLLOW STRICTER RULES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The city attorney's office has obtained a court order to impose strict 
operating conditions at an adult movie theater on Main Street, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Superior Court Judge William Burby issued a five-year injunction 
that calls for owners and operators of the Regent Theater to install additional 
interior lighting, repair seats, patrol aisles and keep the facility in 
"sanitary condition." 
</P>
<P>
 Burby's action on July 26 finalizes on paper a similar agreement reached about 
a week earlier between Deputy City Atty. Maria Perez Manning and theater owner 
Morton Wexler, tenant Abu Tayyib and operator Kae Sun Cho, Manning said. 
</P>
<P>
 Manning filed suit against the defendants last August to curb lewd conduct 
among patrons inside the Regent, 448 S. Main St. Over the past three years, 
vice officers made 50 arrests for lewd conduct, Manning said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than face a lengthy trial, theater management agreed to city officials' 
demands, Manning said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They installed some lighting down the side (of the aisles)," she said. "Now 
you can see the seats." 
</P>
<P>
 An attorney for the theater and Cho said his clients have spent "several 
thousand dollars" to abide by the injunction. "Frankly, the city attorney's 
office and the police have been very cooperative," said Donald Barnett. "I 
don't think that they are trying to close us down." TOMMY LI

<P>
 A convicted slumlord who had just completed serving 30 days under house arrest 
in his own hotel has been given another month to repair his building or else go 
to jail, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the second time that Chung Chuan Wang missed a deadline to bring the 
Modoc Hotel, 819 S. Towne Ave., up to standard housing codes, said Deputy City 
Atty.Lawrence P.V. Punter. 
</P>
<P>
 Wang, who pleaded no contest in March to 10 counts of fire, health and 
building and safety code violations, first failed to make the repairs in June. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Municipal Judge Barry Taylor subsequently found Wang in violation 
of his probation and ordered him to serve 30 days under house arrest. 
</P>
<P>
 The owner again was found in violation of probation after a July 28 hearing in 
which Taylor reviewed photographs showing continued slum conditions, including 
dilapidated floor tiles and ceilings and defective plumbing in some of the 76 
rooms inside the two-story brick hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 The deputy city attorney asked Taylor to sentence Wang to 30 days in County 
Jail and 250 hours of community service for the violation probation. But the 
judge settled for giving the owner until Sept. 28 to fix the hotel while 
"holding the jail time over his head," Punter said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wang's attorney, Bernard Talmas, declined to comment on the case. TOMMY LI

COMMUNITY NEWS: CENTRAL: DOWNTOWN; GRANT AIDS MUSEUM OF NEON ART GALLERY 
</P>

<P>
 The City Council has approved a $415,000 grant to help pay for the Museum of 
Neon Art's return to the community at a 7,000-square-foot site on West Olympic 
Boulevard, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll be working to get the space ready to move in as quickly as we can," 
museum Director Mary Carter said."We're hoping it will be in six to eight 
months." 
</P>
<P>
 The museum, which had been a mainstay on Traction Avenue near Little Tokyo for 
12 years, found a new home last year in Universal CityWalk for its collection 
of electric signs and classic marquees. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the museum intends to keep the free, 1,000-square-foot space on 
Universal CityWalk, Carter wanted to establish a second, larger gallery. 
</P>
<P>
 Community Redevelopment Agency officials stepped in and offered the $415,000 
grant to help the museum set up a site on the ground floor of Renaissance 
Tower, a 192-unit apartment complex at 501 W. Olympic Blvd. 
</P>
<P>
 The money was unanimously approved by the City Council on July 20. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the total grant, $250,000 will go toward tenant improvements, $125,000 will 
cover a portion of the museum's annual operating costs over a five-year period 
and $40,000 will repay the CRA's administrative expenses, officials said.  
</P>
<P>
 Redevelopment officials are looking forward to seeing the museum's economic 
impact in Renaissance Tower, which has yet to lease all its available 
commercial space. "Our hope is that once the museum goes in and brings more 
visitors to the area, there will be an increased interest in retailers to come 
in," said David Riccitiello, a CRA project manager. TOMMY LI

CITY TIMES COVER STORY; A CASE OF MISTAKEN IDENTITY; TO BE A NATIVE IN HEAVILY 
LATINO L.A. IS TO BE INVISIBLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY HELEN BERG

<TEXT>
<P>
 Behind the counter of a local Taco Bell, a teen-ager with dark hair and brown 
skin stood ready to take an order from a well-dressed Latina. But when the 
customer spoke in Spanish, the girl stopped. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do not speak Spanish," she said wearily in English, as if she'd played this 
scene 100 times. "I am Native American." 
</P>
<P>
 As a bystander translated her words, the customer's face glowed in wonder. "A 
real Indian!" the woman exclaimed, leaning across the counter and touching her 
as if to confirm her authenticity. 
</P>
<P>
 This incident, related by John Orendorff, a Cherokee who witnessed the 
exchange and interpreted in Spanish for the customer, illustrates the Native 
American experience in Los Angeles County. Time after time, on the street, in 
school or in workplaces, local Native Americans are victims of mistaken 
identity, said Orendorff, acting director of the American Indian Education 
Commission for the Los Angeles Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
 They may be Navajo, Cherokee or Creek, but because they have brown skin in a 
county of 3.3 million Latinos, they are assumed to be Latino, expected to speak 
Spanish and celebrate Cinco de Mayo. And, Native Americans say, when they 
correct the assumption and identify their heritage, they are treated as relics 
of a forgotten history. 
</P>
<P>
 While the 1990 U.S. Census puts the number of Native Americans in Los Angeles 
County at 45,500, community leaders say it is at least twice that size. 
Regardless, Los Angeles County has the largest Native American population in 
the country outside a reservation -- but it is still the county's smallest 
ethnic group. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike other area ethnic groups, Native Americans have never been concentrated 
in a geographical center, but are scattered throughout the county. Bell Gardens 
and Cudahy are the only two cities in the county where Native Americans have 
ever represented more than 2% of the population, said Joan Weibel-Orlando, an 
associate professor of anthropology at USC. 
</P>
<P>
 To be a Native American in Los Angeles, some say, is to be invisible. 
</P>
<P>
 When Laura Dillard, 46, of Bell enrolled her 10-year-old daughter, Ayla, in a 
Los Angeles elementary school a few years ago, the girl with a braid that hangs 
down to her waist was automatically placed in a bilingual class. Ayla came home 
complaining that she couldn't understand her teacher, who was instructing in 
Spanish. Dillard discovered that officials assumed Ayla was a Latina and spoke 
Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a real problem of misidentification," Orendorff said. Native 
Americans make up less than 1% of the Los Angeles district's student body, he 
said, and sometimes teachers and administrators can be insensitive toward them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I get complaints about teachers celebrating Columbus Day or calling a kid 
chief ," Orendorff said.  
</P>
<P>
 Comments from other youngsters can be just as demeaning. One local high school 
teacher opened a recent class discussion on Native Americans, he said, when one 
of her students interrupted with a question: "Aren't all Native Americans 
dead?"  
</P>
<P>
 Charles Narcho, a teacher's aide at Nimitz Junior High and a Los Angeles 
City/County Native American Indian commissioner, believes that persistent 
feelings of invisibility -- and a conflict between traditional belief systems 
and mainstream culture -- may partly explain some of the social problems Native 
Americans face. 
</P>
<P>
 Nationwide, Native Americans have higher rates of suicide, homicide and 
alcohol-related deaths than any other ethnic group, according to the Indian 
Health Service, a division of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. 
They are also among the poorest people in the country. One-third of the Native 
American population live below the poverty line, according to the 1990 census. 
</P>
<P>
 Choctaws, Sioux, Apaches and other members of more than 200 tribes who left 
reservations where unemployment loomed as high as 80% in search of a better 
life frequently find themselves isolated in urban Los Angeles. Separated from 
families back home and from other Native Americans here, they often discover 
they are the only Native American in their neighborhood, on the job, or in 
their grade at school. 
</P>
<P>
 Dillard was born in a hogan, a traditional Navajo earthen home, on the 
reservation in Blue Gap, Ariz. Raised in a home without running water or 
electricity, Dillard's mother taught her that if there was nothing in the house 
to eat when a stranger comes to call, offer the stranger water. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Over a traditional lunch of mutton and steamed corn, she recalled how as a 
7-year-old, federal officials placed her in a boarding school 30 miles from 
home. Once there, she was forbidden to speak Navajo and rarely saw her parents, 
who traveled only by horse. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't know why we were there," she said, looking down into her bowl of 
stew.  
</P>
<P>
 Dillard graduated from high school, sought work in Los Angeles and married a 
white man, but held onto many of her tribe's customs. Thirty years after 
leaving the reservation, she passes what she can on to her three children, 
partly as a way to pay homage to her ancestors. 
</P>
<P>
 "My grandmother and my grandfather, who was a medicine man, taught me and I 
said, 'I'll never forget,' " said Dillard, who lives with her husband, Dave, 
and two daughters in Bell. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A glance around the Dillards' tiny apartment is proof that here, the Native 
American culture is far from invisible. 
</P>
<P>
 With the stones her grandmother used to grind corn and rugs woven by her 
mother within arm's reach, Dillard and her youngest, Ayla, sang excerpts from 
traditional songs for a visitor. 
</P>
<P>
 "My mom started teaching me (Navajo songs) when I was 6 or 7," Ayla said. 
"When we were babies we would play beauty songs and powwow songs to put us to 
sleep."  
</P>
<P>
 Dillard's two older children have also pursued Navajo arts: Anthony, 22, does 
traditional Navajo sand painting, and Ursula, 15, who dances at powwows and 
other events, recently performed in the World Cup closing ceremonies at the 
Rose Bowl in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 Like many urban Native Americans, Dillard keeps close ties with her family on 
the reservation, visiting often. When Ursula reached puberty, Dillard took her 
to the reservation for the Kinaalda, a four-day coming-of-age ceremony that 
requires special regalia, food and prayer. 
</P>
<P>
 Tradition is also summoned in times of trouble. After a car accident left 
Dillard's brother in a coma, the family accepted modern medical aid but also 
used ancient healing practices, requesting the remedies and prayers of a 
medicine man. 
</P>
<P>
 Dillard's daughters take pride in such customs but say they have few Native 
American friends to share them with. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ayla is the only one I talk to about traditional things," said Ursula, a 
sophomore at the Francisco Bravo Medical Magnet in Boyle Heights.  
</P>
<P>
 One way local Native Americans fight isolation and keep their culture vibrant 
is by gathering at weekend powwows. 
</P>
<P>
 Once gatherings where an individual tribe danced and prayed for the dead, the 
sick or for a successful hunt, powwows today are largely multi-tribal social 
events with spiritual overtones, said Weibel-Orlando of USC. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Powwows are what we have left to identify who we are in the urban setting," 
said Colleen Colson, a Cherokee who is the American Indian liaison for the 
County Department of Health Services. "In our community, people feel lost 
without other Indian people, so they will drive a number of miles just to share 
with other Indian people." 
</P>
<P>
 At the fifth annual City of the Angels Kateri Circle Powwow at Loyola 
Marymount University last month, hundreds of Native Americans gathered to 
dance, sing, gossip and sample Indian tacos and fry bread. 
</P>
<P>
 Observing centuries of tradition, dancers and spectators followed the codes of 
behavior that guide the event. In the most sacred spot at the center of the 
gathering, the drums beat like the heart of the community. 
</P>
<P>
 In the evening's opening processional, hundreds of dancers representing dozens 
of tribes moved slowly in a wide circle around the drum, each wearing their 
tribe's ceremonial regalia, symbols of their many nations. In an initiation 
ceremony, a 5-year-old boy entered the ring of dancing for the first time, 
performing traditional steps.  
</P>
<P>
 Other efforts are under way to keep Native American culture vital and give it 
greater visibility within the broader Los Angeles community. 
</P>
<P>
 The cultural committee of the City/County Native American Indian Commission 
formed a nonprofit corporation last fall to raise funds for a community 
cultural and social service center, said Father Paul Objibway, who chairs the 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
 In November, the committee will help organize a series of public events 
celebrating Native American month, an effort reaching out to other ethnic 
groups. "We have to open up programs to non-Indians as a way of bringing the 
culture to life and demonstrating that there are people attached to it still 
and that it's not just in books or museums," Objibway said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Unified School District has undertaken a pilot program to 
teach a high school ethnic studies course that stresses Native American and 
other minority cultures. The course, "New Majority 2000," could be implemented 
districtwide as early as January and be a required course, Orendorff said. 
</P>
<P>
 The tribes themselves offer their members opportunities to learn about 
language and cultural history, arts and traditions. 
</P>
<P>
 The California Gabrielino tribe, for example, has hosted a ceremony in which 
young men carve canoes and symbolically re-enact a historical trading journey 
from Long Beach to Santa Catalina Island, said Ernie P. Salas, spokesman for 
the tribe. Native Americans, predominantly Gabrielinos, were the sole occupants 
of the Los Angeles Basin until the mid-18th Century, according to 
Weibel-Orlando. California's Native American population numbered as high as 
300,000 at that time, some historians say, but by the early 1900s, after 
Spanish, Mexican and American colonizations of California, the population waned 
to about 15,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Between 1950 and 1960, California's Native American population doubled. The 
Eisenhower Administration launched a program in 1953 to relocate Native 
Americans from reservations to cities, hoping to cut government support of the 
tribes, said Weibel-Orlando, author of "Indian Country, L.A.: Maintaining 
Ethnic Community in Complex Society." The program bused about 40,000 from 
Oklahoma, South Dakota and other Western states to Los Angeles, and promised 
housing assistance, jobs and independence. 
</P>
<P>
 Historians say the federal relocation program placed Native Americans in 
working-class neighborhoods near industrial areas where they could find 
entry-level jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Others tell a different story. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Bureau of Indian Affairs placed people in Southeast Los Angeles first and 
then began scattering people around by design, including down to Orange County, 
so (Native Americans) couldn't organize," said Glenda Ahhaitty, a Cherokee who 
is executive director of the City/County Native American Indian Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The county's Native American population grew 800% between 1955 and 1980, but 
over the years some have abandoned their tribal tradition and culture. 
</P>
<P>
 Some second- or third-generation city dwellers have never visited a 
reservation. Others, said Kathy Whitaker, chief curator of the Southwest 
Museum, may "have no need or desire to attend a powwow but are content to be 
Mr. and Mrs. John Smith who just happen to be Navajo."  
</P>
<P>
 Jack Cluck, 74, a former Cudahy city councilman, was raised in Southeast Los 
Angeles County by a Choctaw mother and a father of Dutch descent. Cluck recalls 
how his mother used herbs to help cure family illnesses but did little to 
educate her 10 children about their American Indian heritage. 
</P>
<P>
 "She just said we were Americans and let it go at that," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Violet Little, 61, an Apache, spent nearly 30 years in Los Angeles and raised 
five children before moving back to San Carlos, N.M. She said she never taught 
her children Apache because their father believed they should assimilate and 
learn English. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was Indian all the way but I didn't pass on Indian ways to the kids," 
Little said. "They started hanging out with Mexican gangs and they thought they 
were Mexican." 
</P>
<P>
 The struggle to keep Native American culture distinct amid other dominant 
cultures is hardly new, Weibel-Orlando said. "I think Native Americans are 
aware that their children are going to be exposed to a number of cultures that 
are quite different than their own and that the culture in school and on the 
street is overwhelming. 
</P>
<P>
 "But most parents would say that our culture is unique and our culture is 
strong and it has withstood all kinds of pressure in the last 500 years." 
</P>
<P>
 Several years ago when the Dillard family lived in Whittier, neighbors would 
ask Ursula if she was Mexican. She would reply that she is white, as her father 
is. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just ignored the part of me that was Native American," she said. "Now I'm 
more proud of who I am. I know I'm different. . . . I would like to marry 
someone who is at least half-Navajo. We've been here so long I don't want (the 
culture) to be lost. I don't want the hogans to disappear. I want my daughter 
to have a Kinaalda."

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Korean Youth and Community Center is sponsoring a water conservation 
campaign that allows area residents to trade in their toilets for models that 
use less water. 
</P>
<P>
 No fees, taxes or extra charges are attached to the trade-in offer, which 
allows residents to save money and conserve water. 
</P>
<P>
 The toilets offered at the center use only about 1 1/2 gallons of water per 
flush, as opposed to conventional models that use three to five gallons. 
</P>
<P>
 To be eligible, residents must present a current picture identification and 
their most recent monthly bill from an active account with the Department of 
Water and Power. Renters must also have proof of their building owner's 
authorization. 
</P>
<P>
 Participants must return with the toilets they replaced within seven days of 
picking up the new models. The old toilets will be recycled. 
</P>
<P>
 The program is offered through the center by the Metropolitan Water District 
along with the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power. 
</P>
<P>
 The Korean Youth and Community Center is at 551 S. Oxford Ave.

SANCHEZ MAKES A SPLASH; ANAHEIM INDOOR SOCCER TEAM SIGNS THE FORMER CAL STATE 
L.A. ATHLETE AFTER HE OUTSHINES 100 CONTENDERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Juan Carlos Sanchez couldn't have asked for a better summer job -- or a 
career. 
</P>
<P>
 But whether or not a career is in the making, the 22-year-old former Cal State 
Los Angeles athlete is content to spend the summer as a member of the Anaheim 
Splash. Sanchez was chosen from nearly 100 players from a two-day open tryout 
for the Continental Indoor Soccer League team in April. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were so many people. I really didn't take it all that serious," Sanchez 
said. "I went out there to see what would happen. I really didn't go out there 
and say, 'I'm going to make it.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Sanchez, who graduated from Cal State L.A. with a degree in physical education 
in June, had planned to try to play in Mexico this summer (His father, Aurelio, 
played professional soccer there for three years). From there, Sanchez intended 
to return to school in September to study physical therapy.  
</P>
<P>
 But Sanchez's plans have been put on hold, at least for the moment. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was going to give it my last shot at professional soccer this summer, but 
this opportunity popped up," said Sanchez, who has renewed aspirations of 
playing in the American Pro Soccer League this winter. "My goal is to play 
outdoors. But if there is a future here for me indoors, I'm willing to take 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 Sanchez seized his opportunity in training camp. He had five goals and four 
assists in three preseason games, prompting the Splash to offer the 5-9, 
161-pound forward a two-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
 "We knew the majority of the players we wanted, but we had an open invitation 
to see what kind of talent was out there in case we did find a diamond in the 
rough. And we found Juan," Splash coach George Fernandez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanchez, the Splash's youngest player, though, was far from an unknown 
commodity. 
</P>
<P>
 Last fall, he was named to the NCAA Division II Western Region team and earned 
All-California Collegiate Athletic Assn. first-team honors for the second year 
in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 As a senior at Garey High in Pomona in 1989, Sanchez was the Hacienda League's 
most valuable player and a member of the CIF Southern Section 3-A Division 
first team after helping the Vikings go undefeated in league play for the 
fourth consecutive season. 
</P>
<P>
 The Continental League, formed in 1993, is the largest professional soccer 
league in the United States with 14 franchises. The Splash was formerly the 
L.A. United, one of the league's seven charter teams. Ogden Facility 
Management, the company that operates the Anaheim Arena, purchased the L.A. 
United from Laker owner Jerry Buss and moved the team to Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 CISL games are played on a field similar to the dimensions of an ice hockey 
rink, 200 feet long and 85 feet wide, and surrounded by dasher boards topped 
with plexiglass. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike outdoor soccer with 11 players on a side, teams are allowed five 
players and a goalkeeper. The game consists of four 15-minute quarters and the 
season runs from June through September with 28 regular-season matches. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's faster than playing outdoors and you have less space, so everything 
seems 100 miles per hour," Sanchez said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here, you have to do everything at full speed. We have two-minute shifts and 
you're in and you're out. And I guarantee that's all it takes to get you 
tired." 
</P>
<P>
 Sanchez has been used as the third forward behind eight-year veteran Dale 
Ervine and Rod Castro, a player with seven years of experience. Sanchez filled 
in for Castro to help the Splash to a 6-3 victory over the Washington Warhogs 
July 19. And Sanchez will likely be pressed into the starting rotation when 
Castro leaves for law school this month. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has a knack for scoring goals, and you can always use a goal scorer," 
Fernandez said. "We have two of the top target guys in the league, so it's kind 
of hard to find him some time. But there's no doubt we have a big future for 
him and he's in our plans." 
</P>
<P>
 Whether or not Sanchez will be in the lineup when the Western Division-leading 
Splash (13-5) face the Arizona Sandsharks tonight at the America West Arena in 
Phoenix won't be determined until game time. It's a scenario that has become a 
familiar and agonizing routine for Sanchez. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's frustrating and demoralizing," Sanchez said. Everybody here is fighting 
for a position and anybody on this team is a potential starter. But play or not 
play, I'm getting paid and the money I'm making is just like a summer job."

 Moose Bailey, who will start at point guard for Loyola High in the fall, 
competed in his final summer basketball tournament last weekend, the Basketball 
Congress International Summer Prep Tournament in Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
 Bailey, one of the area's top senior recruits, played with Team Avia, which 
won four of six games July 28-30. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the past three months, Bailey played in tournaments including the Great 
Western Shootout, West Coast All-Stars and Nike Slam-N-Jam. 
</P>
<P>
 "I played really well throughout the tournaments and the more I play, the more 
I learn what I need to work on," Bailey said. "I have gotten stronger, I am in 
better shape and I have become more consistent with my play. I still need to 
work on my defense." 
</P>
<P>
 Bailey, who will be visiting Tennessee, Penn State, Oregon, Loyola Marymount 
and Portland in September, says he has no college preference yet.

 Carter, known primarily as a three-point specialist, has vastly improved his 
ballhandling and decision-making skills over the summer. Like Bailey, he 
participated in the Great Western Shootout, West Coast All-Stars and Nike 
Slam-N-Jam tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
 His best showing was in Manual Arts' 71-61 win over Dorsey in the championship 
game of the Sports World Tournament at Huntington Park on July 30. Carter, who 
made six three-pointers in the Toilers' semifinal win over Franklin, scored a 
game-high 31 points in the finals against the Dons.

 Carter's improvement at point guard will give Manual Arts a third guard who 
can play at the point guard or two shooting guard spot.

 "Darwin is a slashing guard with superior athleticism and good vision," Coach 
Randolph Simpson said. "He shoots the three as well as anybody in the City, and 
is our best defensive player."

 Carter, who averaged 16 points a game last season, will visit UTEP, Arizona 
State, Northwestern, Kansas State, Oregon and Washington State in September.
