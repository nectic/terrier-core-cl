 ON THE ATTACK: A spirit of meanness is on the rise in American politics, 
according to a bevy of political heavyweights gathered this week at the Ronald 
Reagan Presidential Library near Simi Valley (B4). . . . But dirty campaigning 
has been around for decades, says Simi Valley political consultant Steve Frank 
-- at least since 1888, when President Grover Cleveland was accused of 
fathering a child out of wedlock. "Technology today is better than it's ever 
been so you can find out more," Frank said. But meanness "is nothing new. It's 
always been there." 
</P>
<P>
 JOURNEY'S END: It's been where no spacecraft has gone before -- around the 
planet Venus about 15,000 times. . . . Now, the $900-million Magellan 
spacecraft -- which experienced myriad technical problems -- is at the end of 
its deep-space voyage (B10). . . . Despite the probe's many technical problems, 
Cal Lutheran University professor Tom Janssens said it collected enough data to 
keep scientists busy for years. "It's certainly been spectacular," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 MEDFLY EXPERTS: The Cooperative Medfly Project has helped formulate Ventura 
County's plan of attack on the dreaded Medfly -- including aerial malathion 
spraying beginning tonight (B1, B6). . . . Based in Bell, the group has helped 
manage efforts to eradicate the Medfly across the state. . . . The weapons in 
their arsenal are becoming increasingly sophisticated, among them computers and 
hand-spraying from solar-powered backpacks. 
</P>
<P>
 NO FEAR: Math phobia is not a problem for three Moorpark High School students 
who excelled in the national Future Business Leaders of America competition. . 
. . Andrew Philip, Sishant Narayan and Quan Nguyen ranked among the nation's 
top high school business students, with Andrew winning top honors in business 
calculations. . . . Among the challenges: answering as many as 100 math 
questions in an hour. Moorpark regularly competes in the contest, but had one 
of its best showings this year. "It's been real exciting," said adviser Joyce 
Keefer.

THEATER REVIEW; 'MERCHANT OF VENICE' BEACH? PETER SELLARS STRIKES AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK SWED, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Peter Sellars has come to Chicago, and with him, as usual, is controversy. 
</P>
<P>
 A local gossip columnist, for instance, gasped last week during previews of 
Sellars' new production of "Merchant of Venice" that the director, utilizing 
Shakespeare's text uncut, had originally started out with a seven-hour show. 
Further reports indicated that preview audiences were fleeing in dramatic 
numbers during the single intermission, leaving the Goodman Theatre half full. 
</P>
<P>
 What's the aging enfant terrible of theater, as the local critics have taken 
to calling the 36-year-old Sellars, done this time? 
</P>
<P>
 In short, he has cast Shylock as a black capitalist; Portia and her court are 
Asian; the Venetians, Latino. Venice -- have you guessed? -- is Venice Beach . 
Sellars contends that the racial, sexual and economic tensions of Shakespeare's 
world haven't gone away. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday night's performance did last a full four hours, and, yes, some in the 
opening-night audience left. But most stayed and stood, at the end, for an 
astonished ovation. Seldom is theater so profound. 
</P>
<P>
 Sellars has emphasized in interviews that the starting point for his 
production was Shakespeare's astute analysis of the economic roots of racism. 
But the revolutionary aspect of this production is not the points it makes -- 
they're obvious -- but the questions it asks. And those questions have much 
more to do with language than they do with economics. 
</P>
<P>
 What Sellars asks is, what do we hear when we hear Shakespeare's language, not 
through historical ears, but through our own ears, spoken in our own accents? 
From that comes the unexpected insights into how we communicate in a 
multicultural world, what exactly we are saying and how are we saying it -- or 
more important, not saying it -- to each other. 
</P>
<P>
 Sellars' Shakespeare is spoken in the rhythms and accents of Latin street 
slang; couplets are intoned in the singsong manner of rap. Shylock's lines have 
all the chilly resonance of a middle-level loan officer from hell. All of 
Shakespeare's text is included, but not all is heard. Actors swallow lines, 
emphasize words in their own ways, amplification plays its own intentional 
havoc on lines as they come and go. Some lines are spoken simultaneously, 
whispered inaudibly. 
</P>
<P>
 The result is a familiar play changed and surprising. It is, in fact, changed 
almost as much as if it had become an opera, with nearly every line heard in a 
different context and inflection than it ever has been before. In fact, 
Sellars, who has radicalized opera production by bringing uncompromising 
theater onto the lyric stage, seems to have come full circle. 
</P>
<P>
 When Antonio (Gino Silva), a wealthy gay Latino merchant says he loves 
Bassanio, he means it literally, and there is nothing even faintly amusing 
about his entering into an outrageous loan agreement with Shylock -- a scene 
that will bring chills to the spine of anyone who has ever applied for a 
mortgage. 
</P>
<P>
 Bassanio (John Ortiz) -- a guileless street kid who speaks his lines with an 
ambiguous, cocky flatness, occasionally exploding in uncomprehending rages -- 
tries to play Antonio's affection and that of the wealthy Portia (Elaine Tse), 
a wealthy Bel-Air Asian who has difficulty trusting, off against each other, 
and finds himself emotionally way over his head. Shylock (magnificently played 
by Paul Butler) has probably never seemed more menacing than he does trying to 
maintain a businesslike cool, while emotions are clearly raging inside. On some 
level, in fact, every character in the play is jiving, and much of the 
emotional power of the production comes from the fact that we never know just 
how deep the insecurities lie. 
</P>
<P>
 It is not just Shakespeare's words, however, but also visual signals, that 
make communication at best ambiguous, and Sellars has created a sophisticated 
visual production as well. No set designer is credited -- the stage utilizes 
pieces of cold, modern office furniture against a stark white cyclorama, 
strikingly lit by James F. Ingalls. 
</P>
<P>
 But there are video monitors -- five on stage, four more throughout the 
theater -- that regularly display cinema verite film and video clips of Venice 
Beach, of Portia's Bel-Air estate. Characters also manipulate camcorders to 
provide documentary talking-head close-ups and reaction shots -- Shylock is 
particularly threatening on camera; Portia's quality of mercy speech, 
especially heart-rending. But often, too, the video serves to further 
complicate; in exposing so much it makes one aware of how little is actually 
being seen. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of Sellars' allusions -- his dangerous replacing of Shakespeare's 
controversial stereotypes with controversial modern ones -- are, in fact, 
remarkably telling. Shylock is not a Jew, he is a black who is perceived as a 
Jew. And through him and the others in a production that turns a multiracial 
cast into a tight ensemble, we see just how deep our racism is, how troubled as 
a society we are. But we also, through hearing Shakespeare's language 
transformed into our own, get a cathartic glimpse at how rich we can be as 
well. 
</P>

 'Clerks' Rating Overturned: Miramax Films won a victory Tuesday when the 
Motion Picture Assn. of America overturned an earlier decision and awarded an R 
rating to the movie "Clerks," a film about two boys who work at a New Jersey 
convenience store. The MPAA earlier had given the film an NC-17 rating because 
of "sexual language and content," but Miramax said that amounted to censorship. 
The company also said no further editing was made to the film, which opens in 
Los Angeles and New York on Oct. 19. TELEVISION

MUSIC REVIEW; GERGIEV LEADS KIROV ORCHESTRA IN HEAVY PROGRAM AT SEGERSTROM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CARIAGA, TIMES MUSIC WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An exhausting excellence marked the U.S. tour-closing concert by the Kirov 
Orchestra of St. Petersburg, Monday night in Segerstrom Hall at the Orange 
County Performing Arts Center. Deeply intense performances of Wagner's Prelude 
to "Parsifal," Prokofiev's Fifth Piano Concerto and the Symphony No. 8 by 
Shostakovich became more than engaging in hyper-realistic readings from 
conductor Valery Gergiev and his highly accomplished ensemble -- for some in 
the apparently full hall, they proved fatiguing. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem with this articulate, thrilling and impassioned musical evening, 
however, was not the admirable achievement of the Kirov Orchestra, as wondrous 
as that is; of course, there is no way to get too much of a world-class 
symphonic band. 
</P>
<P>
 But what seemed overabundant in the Costa Mesa hall -- with its 
more-than-welcoming acoustic -- was a program of three serious pieces, each of 
which achieves peaks of loudness as well as of emotion, and seldom stoops to 
non-derisive humor. A respite, somewhere in the evening, was needed. 
</P>
<P>
 The sounds made by the Kirov orchestra, one noticed immediately at the 
beginning of the "Parsifal" excerpt, are expressive, not sensuous -- though 
they can be beauteous, as well as ugly, massive, mellow, grating, velvety and 
metallic. The kind of vaunted, and often narcissistic, orchestral virtuosity 
practiced in (for instance) Berlin, Cleveland and Chicago does not seem to 
exist within the Kirov organization. Its artistic sincerity is straightforward; 
what you hear is music, not showing off. 
</P>
<P>
 This puts a great responsibility on the band's program maker, Gergiev (who may 
be narcissistic -- it seems too early to tell), to create balanced agendas. In 
this one, his unrelieved sobriety, along with his undeniable effectiveness, 
certainly overdid itself. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, the occasion was special, the performances gripping. The 
"Parsifal" Prelude became an object lesson in concentration, linearity and 
near-perfect instrumental balances. 
</P>
<P>
 With the charismatic Alexander Toradze doing the driving, Prokofiev's 
unthinkably complex and difficult Fifth Concerto became an exhilarating vehicle 
for both pianist and orchestra. It moved from first to last with all its 
possible variety and with a demonic sense of continuity. 
</P>
<P>
 Is Shostakovich's Eighth a masterpiece? Does God wear shoes? There are no 
answers to such questions. This performance, closing the St. Petersburg 
ensemble's U.S. tour with mighty noises and inspiring, perfectly placed 
climaxes, posed similar conundrums. Appropriately, there were no encores.

MOVIE REVIEW; 'BROWNING': FINNEY'S RESTRAINT SHINES IN THIS VERSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER RAINER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Adapted from the celebrated Terence Rattigan play, "The Browning Version" is a 
high-class tear-jerker, but Albert Finney's performance is considerably more 
than that. As Andrew Crocker-Harris, the classics professor for more than two 
decades at a posh British boys' school, Finney is remarkably good at conveying 
the rumblings of emotion in this musty, disappointed man. Finney doesn't 
slobber us with sentiment. His restraint really shines. 
</P>
<P>
 Rattigan's warhorse, which he expanded for the screen in the famous 1951 film 
starring Michael Redgrave, is the kind of material where every emotion is 
calibrated, every nuance signaled. Screenwriter Ronald Harwood has done an 
intelligent job updating the material, and Mike Figgis has directed with 
enormous tact, but, excepting Finney's performance, the film doesn't really 
work up a sweat. It's no "Dead Poets Society" jamboree (thankfully). "The 
Browning Version" keeps its cool even though it's mostly about people in 
misery, and maybe that's a clue to its highbrowish appeal. It presents a way of 
dealing with suffering that allows art-house audiences the opportunity to 
sniffle stoically. Its pathos won't run your makeup. 
</P>
<P>
 Crocker-Harris is married to a considerably younger woman, Laura (Greta 
Scacchi), who is having an affair with the chemistry professor, Frank (Matthew 
Modine), an American teaching in England through an exchange program. The love 
went out of their marriage long ago; what's left is mostly spite and 
recrimination. 
</P>
<P>
 For most of the movie she picks away at her mate, as he recoils and 
disapproves. It's like a stuffed-shirt rendering of a Strindberg marriage, and 
Harwood hasn't softened very much Rattigan's borderline cruelty toward Laura. 
She's the villain of the piece -- her lover is merely deluded by her rapacious 
wiles. We can't quite see in Laura the young woman who would have been 
entranced by the brainy classics scholar. Scacchi doesn't provide the soundings 
of character that might humanize her. 
</P>
<P>
 The core relationship in "The Browning Version" is really between 
Crocker-Harris and Taplow (Ben Silverstone), a student who -- realizing what a 
hated reputation his teacher has with his classmates -- warms up to him anyway. 
Taplow doesn't entirely fit in with the other students; he still retains a 
fresh-faced idealism that has already been drummed out of his mates. He's not a 
terribly swift student but he's open to experience, and so he's open to what 
Crocker-Harris can teach him -- not only about Aeschylus but about life. It 
takes a while for Crocker-Harris to perceive the boy's innate decency, but when 
he does -- when Taplow gifts him with a secondhand copy of Robert Browning's 
translation of the "Agamemnon" -- he's deeply, unspeakably moved. 
</P>
<P>
 Finney plays this scene, and the subsequent scene when he believes he has been 
taken for a fool, with the utmost artistry. When Crocker-Harris' brittle, 
settled reserve shatters it's almost unbearable to watch. He has assumed so 
many layers of protection that his rawness has a tragic, unseemly power. 
</P>
<P>
 As Michael Redgrave played him, Crocker-Harris was a parched sufferer who 
looked primped as if by an undertaker; it was a great performance, but 
Finney's, more bullish and hefty, is equally amazing. Finney gives us a man 
whose correspondence with the classics is a key to his faraway glaze. 
</P>
<P>
 In his sessions with his students he must play the bemused tyrant to make them 
learn, and that degrades his life. That's why he's so replenished when Taplow 
makes a gesture of friendship: The boy inscribes a Greek quotation in the 
Browning gift, and it's as if Crocker-Harris had received a holy book. In 
moments like these, "The Browning Version" is great. A flash of human decency 
burns into high drama.

MUSIC REVIEW; MONDAY CONCERTS OPEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A rousing performance by the Schoenberg Quartet from the Netherlands launched 
another season, another round of contemporary musical provocations courtesy of 
Monday Evening Concerts. 
</P>
<P>
 This season began with a profound bang at L.A. County Museum of Art's Bing 
Theater.This was an evening of powerful, uncompromising music played with 
conviction and the kind of clarity that lays bare the soul beneath the notes. 
</P>
<P>
 True to the ensemble's name, the Schoenberg Quartet originated with a focus on 
the serialism of the Second Viennese School. Yet this program circled around 
the doctrines of that infamous school, even closing with the L.A. premiere of 
Louis Andriessen's "Facing Death," which takes its cues, broadly, from be-bop. 
</P>
<P>
 Rest assured, seminal modernists were represented here, if outside of 12-tone 
form. Anton Webern's dryly plaintive 1905 String Quartet represents a stop on 
the road to his liberation from tonality. Opening the concert was the 
underrated Alexander Zemlinsky's 1924 String Quartet. 
</P>
<P>
 The closest thing to a strictly atonal scheme came in Klaas de Vries' 1993 
String Quartet, the most satisfying work on the program. A kind of atonal 
impressionism is at work here, amid the compelling maze of ethereal textures, 
phantom tones and prickly, nervous outbursts. 
</P>
<P>
 A jaunt to the finish, Andriessen's virtuosic piece is a deft and darkly 
cheeky working of the unlikely median between row music and jazz riffs, a 
frenzied compendium of be-bop phrases, including quotes from Charlie Parker's 
"Ornithology."JOSEF WOODARD

 Robert Plant and Jimmy Page may have waited past the point of anticlimax to 
reteam, but it may be that anticlimactic aura that's part of the appeal of 
their unassumingly enjoyable MTV special tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 The former Led Zeppelin leaders' 90-minute "one-time reunion" show, popularly 
billed as "Jimmy Page/Robert Plant (Unledded)" -- or, as it's identified in the 
title cards, "No Quarter" -- seems less like forced event-programming 
reanimation than a casual resumption between fated consorts. There's not an 
overriding urgency to their pairing here, but it doesn't have the faux 
informality of a lot of the "Unplugged" shows on which it's partially modeled, 
either. More often than not, they do get the lead out. 
</P>
<P>
 Eight of 12 songs included were performed before a live audience on a London 
sound stage dressed to resemble the "Unplugged" sets, though very little of the 
music is in an acoustic or duo format. Here, a band that includes the young 
rhythm section from Plant's usual touring band bashes convincingly through a 
few of Zeppelin's more balladic or bluesier numbers, and on the thrashier tunes 
is joined by the smallish London Metropolitan Orchestra and the Egyptian 
Ensemble, who add all varieties of oud, tabla, et al. to the Anglo-Eastern 
tableau. 
</P>
<P>
 Four tunes were shot live on exotic location, rather the way '70s concert 
movies had bands rocking out at Pompeii. "No Quarter" is taken in a lush 
forest, though the voice and acoustic guitar are so heavily filtered that the 
effect is none too woodsy; "Nobody's Fault but Mine" is Euro-blues in a rock 
quarry; two more numbers have the duo doing extended riffing on the streets of 
Marrakech as the locals clap or play along. (The best juxtaposition has Page at 
his most lunatic fiddling with an effects box, while a Moroccan kid holds his 
fingers in his ears.)  
</P>
<P>
 There are slightish new tunes slipped in, but nothing that would suggest Plant 
and Page were inordinately interested in expanding the Zep-classic canon. The 
reason to tune in here is to hear "Four Sticks" or the inevitable capper 
"Kashmir" excitingly revived with the latent Eastern flavor made 
orchestratively blatant, or just to rediscover the un-updated beauty of "Thank 
You." 
</P>
<P>
 For those not cable-ready, a bound-to-best-sell soundtrack arrives in early 
November. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Jimmy Page/Robert Plant (Unledded)" premieres at 10 tonight on MTV, with 
repeat airings Saturday and Sunday.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: GLENDALE; ALEX THEATER 
TO SHOW 'GONE WITH THE WIND' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Though the Alex Theater's first year as a performing arts hub has been rocky, 
a group of local film enthusiasts is convinced the venue's future is anything 
but "Gone With the Wind." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, members of the nonprofit Alex Film Society have slated a gala 
screening of the 4 1/2-hour 1939 MGM Civil War drama at 7 p.m. Nov. 17 as a 
kickoff for what they hope will be a revival of classic American films at the 
Alex. 
</P>
<P>
 "Seeing classic films in the Alex is like reliving them," said Brian Ellis, 
president of the film society and first assistant director of the NBC sitcom 
"Frasier." 
</P>
<P>
 "Our events won't be panned, scanned, colorized or cut for time like on TV, 
and seeing films at the Alex is vastly superior to viewing the tiny theaters of 
multiplex cinemas," Ellis said. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers said the group plans to show popular musicals and dramas from the 
1930s through the 1950s. Plans are in the works for possible screenings of 
restored prints of "The Wizard of Oz" and "Doctor Zhivago." 
</P>
<P>
 Located at 216 N. Brand Blvd., the Alex's days as a movie house were over by 
the time the Glendale Redevelopment Agency bought it from Mann Theatres in 1991 
for about $800,000.  
</P>
<P>
 After a $6.5-million restoration it was reopened as a venue for musical 
theater and concerts in January.  
</P>
<P>
 But Theater Corp. of America, the firm hired to book shows and run the 
operation, balked midway through the first year of a five-year contract and the 
city is suing the company and looking for a new theater manager. The theater is 
being run by the Alex Regional Theater Board, a nonprofit group. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeanne Armstrong, Glendale's director of redevelopment, lauded the film 
society as a group of "dedicated volunteers" intent on bringing movies back to 
the Alex. She said the Redevelopment Agency helped the group locate equipment 
that had been put in storage after Mann Theaters closed the Alex, including a 
35-millimeter film projector and a sound system. 
</P>
<P>
 Armstrong said there had been little discussion of showing movies at the Alex 
because when the Redevelopment Agency purchased the theater from Mann, it 
agreed not to screen movies on a commercial basis. 
</P>
<P>
 "The agreement has a covenant stating that we cannot compete with the Mann 
Theaters (in the Exchange, a nearby office and retail complex)," Armstrong 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "But onetime screenings to benefit a charity or nonprofit group are allowed." 
</P>
<P>
 Three screenings of "Gone with the Wind" are slated -- Nov. 17 and 18 at 7 
p.m. and Nov. 20 at 1 p.m. For information, call (818) 243-2539.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: SUNLAND; RESIDENTS TO 
CLEAN TUJUNGA PONDS AREA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sunland residents have organized a cleanup of the Tujunga Ponds, a spot near 
the point where Foothill Boulevard crosses over the Tujunga Wash that has been 
polluted by litter and illegal swimmers. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's trashed everywhere," said Phil Tabbi, a community police representative, 
who is organizing the Oct. 22 cleanup."The fences have been cut." 
</P>
<P>
 The ponds are within the protected Tujunga Wash and swimming there is illegal. 
However, trespassers have cut the protective wire fencing and have been 
swimming at the ponds "for some time," Tabbi said. He visited the site recently 
and saw piles of garbage, including disposable diapers, three feet high, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, police have started to cite the illegal swimmers, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The cleanup already has local 4-H clubs and Scouting, equestrian and church 
groups pitching in. Others who want to help may call (818) 768-0988.

'THREE-STRIKES' WORRIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A report on the "three-strikes" law just published by the California Higher 
Education Policy Center in Sacramento says upfront, "We (do not) take issue 
with the primacy of public safety or the state's need for more stringent rules 
for keeping habitual, violent criminals off our streets." But the center, 
unaffiliated with any university and employing the cold, objective language of 
economic analysis, goes on to offer a perspective on the unintended 
consequences of the "three-strikes" law that makes for sobering reading indeed. 
</P>
<P>
 Maintaining only current levels of access, the University of California and 
California State University systems face a 50% increase in enrollment of 
full-time students by 2006. Between now and then, the state's revenue will also 
increase, but 70% of the state budget is already committed by law to debt 
payments, federal matching fund mandates and funding for elementary, secondary 
and junior college education. Of the remaining 30%, 100% of the anticipated 
increase will be required for prison construction and operation after 1996-97.  
</P>
<P>
 The implication here is that if Proposition 184 passes and no additional major 
revenue is found, there could be no new money whatsoever for new college 
students. It is thus entirely arguable that the UC and Cal State systems could 
be replaced by different sorts of institutions with either severely limited 
enrollment or drastically increased tuition. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course "three-strikes" proponents argue that public safety is paramount. 
And they are right. But intelligent, minor modification of "three strikes," 
concentrating on violent offenders, for example, could even now forestall the 
worst. After all, the November ballot's Proposition 184 duplicates the "three 
strikes" law that was passed by the Legislature last March. It remains on the 
ballot only because its backers want to put it beyond the reach of even modest 
modification by the very Legislature that has passed it. That could prove to be 
a huge mistake, even if the very worst of the worst-case analysis proves to be 
overstated.

ART TORRES FOR TOP STATE CONSUMER JOB; STATE SENATOR IS PREFERABLE FOR 
INSURANCE COMMISSIONER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Insurance -- whether for homes, automobiles, health coverage or workers' 
compensation -- has been a hot political topic in California for some time now. 
There have been many controversies over how much it costs, how available it is 
to consumers and businesses and the ways insurance companies deal with 
policyholders. The unceasing disputes were one reason state voters in 1988 made 
the post of insurance commissioner elective by approving Proposition 103, the 
much-debated initiative that also aimed to roll back auto and liability 
insurance rates. 
</P>
<P>
 The overall effectiveness of Proposition 103 remains open to argument, but 
there can be little doubt that its provision giving voters, rather than the 
governor, the power to select California's insurance commissioner made that 
previously obscure post an important and highly visible one. The state's first 
elected commissioner, John Garamendi, used the position as a bully pulpit to 
become a strong -- some critics uncharitably argued strident -- advocate for 
consumers who felt the insurance industry needed to be firmly regulated. He 
also used the commissioner's job as a springboard for a campaign for the 
Democratic nomination for governor, and is now leaving office as a result of 
his defeat in that race earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The two major-party candidates running to replace Garamendi are both veteran 
members of the Legislature who must move on to new jobs because of term limits. 
Both state Sen. Art Torres (D-Los Angeles) and Assemblyman Charles W. 
Quackenbush (R-Cupertino) can proudly point to long records of public service 
in Sacramento, and both are well-regarded as political moderates more 
interested in getting things done than in ideological posturing. We endorse 
Torres on the basis of his experience in dealing with insurance issues and his 
track record as a conscientious, but not contentious, advocate for consumers. 
</P>
<P>
 Torres has been chairman of the Senate's Insurance Committee for three years. 
He was elevated to that post by the leadership of the Legislature after the 
previous chairman, Alan Robbins, agreed to plead guilty to taking bribes from a 
powerful insurance industry lobbyist, among other counts. Torres helped restore 
public confidence in the committee. He pushed legislation to reform the state's 
badly run workers' compensation system, to crack down on auto insurance fraud 
and to protect the rights of homeowners who complained they had been poorly 
served by insurance companies after disasters like the Oakland Hills fire and 
the Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Although hard-working, Quackenbush simply cannot match Torres' track record on 
insurance issues or his knowledge of the insurance industry. A Silicon Valley 
resident, Quackenbush has good ideas on using computer technology to make the 
state insurance department, and the industry itself, more efficient and 
customer-friendly -- ideas that should interest Torres. 
</P>
<P>
 It is somewhat troubling that more than half of the money given to 
Quackenbush's campaign (more than $600,000 by last accounting) has come from 
insurance industry sources. By contrast, Torres has accepted roughly $100,000 
from sources with insurance industry links, mostly law firms that represent 
insurance companies. Both legislators argue they would not allow insurance 
industry money to sway them from the strongly pro-consumer stance that 
Garamendi took, and we take them at their word. But on the basis of their 
records, Torres' claim surely will sound more credible to voters -- as it did 
to us.

FLOWERING THE DESERT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a few days President Clinton will sign the California Desert Protection 
Act. That should be the signal for all involved to drop obstructionistic 
tactics and cooperate in implementing this historic legislation, which 
designates two new national parks, a national preserve and 63 new wilderness 
areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Even in the late days of congressional wrangling, federal Bureau of Land 
Management officials in California lobbied against their own bosses at the 
Department of Interior to water down the bill and give less authority to the 
National Park Service. The Department of Defense, which has five major military 
bases in the Mojave Desert, also posed difficult obstacles, mainly to preserve 
the right of its aircraft to fly low over the newly protected areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Implementation of the law is likely to be almost as contentious as its passage 
by Congress, and pose a test of whether the government can avoid past mistakes 
in the development of national parks. In cooperation with other agencies, local 
and federal, the Interior Department has the opportunity now to apply the 
latest in ecosystem management tools to preserve the fragile, vital desert. 
</P>
<P>
 The Park Service and the BLM have begun to reshuffle responsibilities. Signs 
designating the new boundaries will go up almost immediately. The biggest task 
will be to transfer the 1.4 million acres of the new Mojave National Preserve 
to the Park Service, implementing new rules for off-road vehicles, mining, 
hunting, rights of way, grazing and the like. The boundaries of the new Death 
Valley and Joshua Tree national parks will be expanded, and the BLM will have 
to administer new wilderness areas. It will take a year or two to fully 
implement the law. 
</P>
<P>
 The task is complicated enough without interagency bickering. We respect the 
BLM's historic stewardship of the California desert and the military's need for 
training areas and overflights. But the time has come to put aside petty 
rivalries and work out a new rationale for protecting this invaluable resource 
for posterity.

MINING LAW REFORM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The death of legislation to reform the 1872 mining law comes as an intolerable 
shock (Sept. 30). For 122 years, the American people have been royally ripped 
off by the mining industry.Each year, these giant corporations, many of them 
foreign, take billions of dollars in gold, silver, copper and other minerals 
that belong to Americans, and pay nothing to the U.S. Treasury. What do they 
leave behind on the nation's heritage of public lands? Poisoned drinking water 
wells, dead rivers, and moonscapes of gaping holes that could bury the Empire 
State Building. Who pays to clean up the mess? We, the taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet this Congress, the majority of which reflects its constituents' support of 
reforming this antiquated law -- nothing less than absurd and outlandish in 
this day and age -- failed to stand up to a few Western senators bought and 
paid for by the mining industry. 
</P>
<P>
 The failure to reform the 1872 mining law is a lesson in the corruption 
brought on by our campaign financing system. It is also a frightening example 
of the power of the almighty buck to destroy the fragile environment that life 
itself, and future profits for that matter, depends on.

JOHN SPINDLER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the case of the Simi Valley junior high student, John Spindler, who was 
suspended for violating the dress code (Oct. 4), the ACLU has once again put 
questionable principles before common sense and added to our overburdened court 
system with frivolous litigation. There is no consitutional issue at 
stake.Parents and school board members approved this dress code. Spindler says 
he wants to return to school but is reluctant to bend to the school's policy. 
Welcome to the world, John. Sometimes you have to bend to policy.  
</P>
<P>
 I applaud the Simi Valley Unified School District for promoting a 
"professional learning environment." Shame on Spindler's parents, who should 
have insisted that their son put on a proper shirt and buckle down to his 
studies.  
</P>

 * Bravo Simi Valley! Boy, you really taught that criminal 14-year-old a lesson 
by prohibiting his attendance at Valley View. Do you really want us to believe 
that Spindler's wearing a patriotic T-shirt is against the law? What law? If 
the law prohibits patriotic gestures by our young people, then the law is 
desperately wrong and should be opposed. Instead of supporting the young man, 
you blindly and cowardly follow some ridiculous school code banning patriotic 
attire. 
</P>
<P>
 Shame on Simi Valley. Shame on its school district. In an era where American 
pride is nonexistent among our youth, that's just what we need. When I was 
attending high school in the late '80s, wearing a patriotic T-shirt would cause 
me insults and threats. There was a physical threat to me. But persecution from 
our school leaders and government officials is beyond horrific -- it's evil.

MISSING LINK

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The editorial of Sept. 29, "Human/Ape Link -- Missing No More?," astounds me! 
</P>
<P>
 The third paragraph takes a broad swipe at "creation science," calling it 
"bogus science," then declares "Darwinian evolution is a theory that has been 
confirmed beyond doubt." Anyone who believes this is either uninformed, under 
delusion, or has taken a wild leap of faith!

POLITICAL ADS AND SENATE RACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Today, our politicians must hire specialists to make ads that will invade our 
hearts and abandon our minds, or they have a slim chance of being elected. 
There is something un-American about the political commercials on TV, 
commercials that are always an illogical cheap shot. The Democrats are just as 
guilty as the Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
 After watching the many political TV commercials, I can only come to one 
conclusion. The attack on America won't be at the beaches, it won't be on our 
airports or harbors, our industry or military bases. The attack will be to gain 
control of our TVs. And, by doing so they shall have used our hearts to control 
how we vote. Will they win America? Perhaps they already have. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe the time has come for a lot more power to be shifted to local government 
and away from the federal government, so Americans will be able to vote from 
how their lives are being lived, instead of what they see on TV.

 * I see that Republican Gov. Pete Wilson in his reelection campaign is trying 
to keep business in the state. In fact he now claims credit for keeping Fox 
studios from leaving (Sept. 26). On the other hand, Republican senatorial 
candidate Mike Huffington takes pride in the fact that he failed to come to the 
aid of a major California company because he didn't want to be "beholden to 
private interests." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, tell me -- these candidates for the highest governmental offices in the 
state, coming from the same political party, are showing radically different 
views; which path shall we choose? 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 * Let us finally dispense with this notion that Huffington "is buying" this 
election for the U.S. Senate and that Dianne Feinstein is the poor girl doing 
what most politicians do. 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone who spends money for a political job is buying that job. Whether one 
uses his own money or that of others, i.e., special interest groups and other 
contributors, does not matter. The sadness is that Feinstein is very reluctant 
to use any part of her $50 million (Sept. 25). 
</P>
<P>
 I am no apologist for Huffington, but The Times does report on Sept. 23 that 
Feinstein received $390,970 from interests opposing health care reform. It had 
been previously reported she withdrew her "support" position "quietly" last 
May, suggesting the reform bill be postponed till after the November elections. 
Huffington accepts no special-interest money. By this stretch of one's 
imagination, can we suggest that special-interest groups are buying Feinstein's 
election?

 * Does Huffington honestly believe that after watching his misleading 
television commercials the voters will fall for his line that he is not 
answerable to special interests because he is financing his Senate race 
entirely out of his own pocketful of millions? Isn't it obvious that this man 
with less than one term in the House and no record of accomplishment for his 
recently adopted state does have a special interest -- himself?

 * If a senator or representative has over a 50% approval rating at the end of 
the year, in the year before elections, he or she should automatically be 
assigned a second term. This would save loads of money and spare voters the 
task of weeding through lies and smears by carpetbaggers like Huffington.

PASSIVE SMOKING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The article "Headlines and High Anxiety" (by David Shaw, Sept. 11) quotes an 
analyst of the Office of Technology Assessment on the topic of passive 
smoking.I am writing to correct a possible misimpression that that statement 
reflects OTA's position or findings. 
</P>
<P>
 OTA and its staff do not take positions in areas we have not studied. We have 
not conducted any relevant studies on passive smoking that would allow us to 
take a position in regard to its health effects or about EPA's regulatory 
stance, and therefore the agency and its staff have no official position on 
these matters.

PERSPECTIVE ON THE SIMPSON TRIAL; MEDIA PUT JUSTICE IN HARM'S WAY; THE FIRST 
AMENDMENT WAS MEANT AS A SHIELD FOR THE OPPRESSED, BUT THE PRESS HAS NOW BECOME 
THE OPPRESSOR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES OGLETREE, Charles Ogletree is a professor of law and director of the 
Criminal Justice Institute at Harvard Law School. This commentary is adapted 
from a speech he delivered Tuesday at USC as part of the National Ethics 
Workshop series sponsored by the Poynter Institute for Media Studies, the USC 
School of Journalism, the Foundation for American Communications and the Los 
Angeles chapter of the Society of Professional Journalists. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On Sept. 21, a Los Angeles television station offered some breaking news on 
the O.J. Simpson case. The station had learned from "reliable sources" that DNA 
tests had been performed on a bloody sock found at the Simpson home and the 
blood had matched that of Nicole Brown Simpson's. If this evidence were true, 
it would add substantial weight to the government's case of circumstantial 
evidence against Simpson.  
</P>
<P>
 It turned out that the report was false. 
</P>
<P>
 The press coverage in the Simpson case has been harmful in several respects. A 
number of matters reported were patently false, such as a shovel as the 
possible murder weapon and a bloody ski mask supposedly found at Simpson's 
house. Even worse is the damage the press is doing to evidence that does exist, 
such as the testimony that was compromised when the witness was paid for "an 
exclusive story." 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Lance A. Ito would have a strong factual basis to justify restraining 
the press from some sort of access without violating the First Amendment. 
</P>
<P>
 The legal analysis of the constitutionality of a judicial restraint on public 
access to information focuses on highly individualized factual elements. The 
aspects of this case that make it so unique, particularly in terms of press 
coverage and the influence of the press, thus increase the likelihood that 
Judge Ito could impose a ban.  
</P>
<P>
 A 1976 Supreme Court decision has generally been interpreted as a virtual ban 
to prior restraints on the reporting of news about a crime. However, if any 
case could be justified as an exception to the general rule, the Simpson case 
would be it, especially since so much of the information published is fraught 
with errors. The problem is exacerbated in that false pretrial publicity is 
more potentially prejudicial to a defendant than information that is merely 
incriminating. A prior restraint on publishing material whose veracity has not 
been adequately confirmed may be a sufficiently specific edict to avoid the 
concerns of being too vague and too broad. 
</P>
<P>
 The danger of pretrial publicity does not necessarily have to create a choice 
between the defendant's Sixth Amendment rights and the First Amendment 
guarantee of freedom of the press. The government is prohibited from trying an 
accused in a prejudicial atmosphere, and if pretrial publicity prevents the 
impaneling of an impartial jury, the Sixth Amendment entitles the defendant to 
a dismissal of the charges against him. Under this view, the interests 
justifying suppression of prejudicial news are also in the state's interests of 
convicting criminals and maintaining the integrity of the system. 
</P>
<P>
 However, I worry about the gray area, in which publicity harms a defendant, or 
otherwise skews the prosecution of the case in general, but in a way that may 
not rise to the clear impossibility of impaneling an impartial jury. 
</P>
<P>
 I am not, however, advocating that Judge Ito use his authority to impose any 
restraints on the press. The press, despite its flaws, has a valuable mission 
to fulfill. First, it is only the press that can refute the rumors that will 
inevitably occur. If there is no press access, or a curtailment of press 
access, the problems would only be exacerbated. Anonymous witnesses would offer 
juicy rumors and the press would be curtailed from asking attorneys on either 
side the validity of the allegations. 
</P>
<P>
 Second, when the press shows injustice occurring, people are often motivated 
to take action. When Los Angeles television stations provided live coverage of 
the beating of Reginald Denny, and others during the Los Angeles riots, 
citizens watching the incident on television went out to provide aid and 
protection for the victims. The police department, having failed to protect 
citizens during the rebellion, also used the coverage to later identify and 
prosecute many of the offenders. 
</P>
<P>
 Third, the press frenzy has gotten so out of hand that some might plausibly 
argue that Simpson's rights are not as threatened as they might be. What I am 
suggesting is that the average American is probably now confused by all the 
stories, all the recantations, all the accusations of lies and libel. We have 
been so inundated that we are unsure of the truth, and that may make us 
skeptical of placing blame on Simpson. However, Simpson's ability to receive a 
fair trial, given the extraordinary array of lawyers and experts working with 
him, does not mean that we can take comfort in the way our legal system 
dispenses justice. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm no longer worried about O.J.'s ability to receive a fair trial. I now 
worry about A.J., B.J., C.J. and P.J. -- the countless women and men who are 
pushed through our criminal justice system every day represented by lawyers who 
cannot hire investigators, expert witnesses or locate witnesses who might aid 
in their defense. If the press wanted to really serve an important public 
function, I would suggest spending more time examining the underbelly of the 
beast and informing the public how ordinary defendants fare in the 
criminal-justice system. 
</P>
<P>
 In my criticism of the press, I do not mean to ignore the invaluable role the 
press has played in improving our system. One need only examine the positive 
impact of television on the civil-rights movement, or how Anthony Lewis, in his 
moving portrayal of Clarence Gideon in the book "Gideon's Trumpet," persuaded 
scores of law students that working for indigent defendants in the criminal 
justice system was a noble cause. I'm reminded of the phrase often used by the 
legendary journalist Fred Friendly, who continually reminds us that we must 
move beyond arguments, that we have the right to do something and focus on 
doing the right thing. 
</P>
<P>
 What I do worry about, however, is that people have a certain trust in what 
they see and read. Not a blind trust, but a certain belief that the burden of 
proof to show innocence falls on the exposed "villain" if he is captured live 
on television doing something wrong. "I saw it on TV; he must be guilty." This, 
however, is not the way the law works. The burden of proof is always on the 
state; and whether we are talking about the Los Angeles policemen or O.J. 
Simpson or Al Cowlings, that burden never shifts, even if the camera says 
otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
 And what this suggests is that the fears of government oppression expressed in 
the First Amendment may be somewhat superseded by the power of the press. The 
First Amendment was written to protect the rights of those whose voices might 
be suppressed by government censorship. We still live with that fear, no doubt. 
But what is also clear is that Judge Ito, a government actor, may not be the 
worst threat facing men like O.J. Simpson. The press is now the oppressor, 
finding fuel in the First Amendment to persecute and condemn. The press may 
become the same villain, making justice impossible by drowning out the voice of 
truth that the First Amendment was designed to protect.

AN APOCALYPTIC VISION FINDS A LOGICAL, TRAGIC END; RELIGION: SOLAR TEMPLE 
MEMBERS FORESAW ENVIRONMENTAL DOOM AS THE POST-COLD WAR END. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL BARKUN, Michael Barkun, professor of political science in the 
Maxwell School of Syracuse University, is the author of Religion and the Racist 
Right (University of North Carolina Press, 1994). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The deaths of more than 50 members of the Order of the Solar Temple in 
Switzerland and Quebec remain obscure, the motives as yet tangled and the 
perpetrators unclear. But whether the deaths were the result of murder, suicide 
or some combination of the two, it is still possible to make some preliminary 
observations.  
</P>
<P>
 However tangled the motives for the deaths, the Solar Temple had a following 
-- and the existence of this following compels us to seriously examine the 
group's beliefs. Foremost among those beliefs was the conviction that an 
overwhelming, imminent cosmic disaster was inevitable; its vast destruction the 
necessary prelude to anticipated world transformation. This apocalyptic vision 
of the Earth on the edge of a final calamity is by now a familiar theme among 
millenarian groups. 
</P>
<P>
 The Solar Temple, however, was distinctive in part because it drew its 
apocalyptic vision of the end of history from unusual sources. Unlike more 
widespread Christian millennialism, the Solar Temple drew from occultism and 
ecological doomsayers. Religious fundamentalism remains a major source of 
apocalyptic ideas and imagery, but they may also be found in the occult and New 
Age, in neo-Malthusian social thought and in scientific predictions of 
environmental collapse. 
</P>
<P>
 Scenarios of ecological disaster have become particularly prominent among 
contemporary apocalyptic sectarians, especially those influenced by New Age 
ideas. At a time when many natural disasters have lost their power to shock, 
and the end of the Cold War has reduced fears of a nuclear holocaust, 
environmental disasters emerge as a potent expression that the world is ending. 
</P>
<P>
 While the attraction of apocalyptic sects is in part attributable to the 
charisma of leaders like the Solar Temple's Luc Jouret, the beliefs themselves 
figure importantly in the decision of adherents to give themselves totally to 
such affiliations. The Solar Temple appears to have had a core of highly 
committed members, recruited through Jouret's practice of creating 
organizations within organizations, so that as their commitment grew, followers 
could move to more demanding inner circles of the movement. 
</P>
<P>
 Both the beliefs themselves and a structure of organizations nested within one 
another reflect a principal reason for the appeal of such groups -- the belief 
among members that they and they alone know the true nature of reality. This 
secret knowledge exerts a powerful appeal, while at the same time offering a 
convenient explanation for why the group has failed to attract a mass 
membership. The general population is deemed too ignorant, deceived or 
spiritually impoverished to grasp the message. Sect members also believe they 
are the elite who will enjoy and perhaps rule in the perfect new existence that 
will follow the predicted catastrophe. 
</P>
<P>
 The Solar Temple experience reaffirms the volatility of those millenarian and 
apocalyptic groups that organize in physically isolated communal settlements. 
</P>
<P>
 Such separation can have potent consequences. By severing ties to the larger 
environment, members cut themselves off from information that might contradict 
their beliefs. Withdrawal often produces factionalism within the group, and 
rivalries over leadership are a common result. Lastly, separation often 
embroils a group in the very society it despises and seeks to escape. Its 
withdrawal may stimulate suspicion by the authorities and sometimes leads to 
clashes between communal millenarians and the authorities. Disputes erupt over 
weapons, taxes, the treatment of children and other issues where the demands of 
the state collide with a group's claims to a separate existence. 
</P>
<P>
 Millenarian groups have a centuries-long history in the West. Such activity 
ebbs and flows, although the proximity to the year 2000 helps explain the 
present heightened interest. The decimal system, with its round numbers, leads 
us to invest dates that end in zeros with special significance. Nowhere is this 
clearer than in the millennial year that approaches. Hence, for all its 
strangeness, the Solar Temple is emblematic of a rising cultural mood that sees 
a historic watershed in the year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
 The proliferation of millenarian groups has not been matched by a more 
sophisticated understanding of their character. Instead, they tend to be lumped 
together as cults, dismissed as inherently disreputable, manipulative and 
irrational. In fact, despite their common belief in imminent transformation, 
they often differ dramatically.  
</P>
<P>
 The vast majority of members of millenarian groups join them and remain in 
them out of conviction, believing them to make sense of the world. Classifying 
the groups as cults substitutes a pejorative label for understanding.

 Only two years after Jerry Tarkanian was forced out as Nevada Las Vegas 
basketball coach, his former top assistant might be brought back as head coach.

 Tim Grgurich, a former UNLV assistant, appeared closer Tuesday to replacing 
lame-duck Rollie Massimino by the time the Runnin' Rebels open practice 
Saturday for the upcoming season. 
</P>
<P>
 Massimino was still officially the coach pending a meeting today with the 
university's interim president. But he sounded like he was awaiting only the 
completion of a buyout deal offered by the university. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought this was a really great experience," Massimino said Tuesday of his 
short reign in one of college basketball's most visible positions. 
</P>
<P>
 Kenny Guinn, UNLV interim president, was to meet for a second time with 
Massimino today. An agreement was expected on a reported $1.5-million buyout of 
his contract.

 Olympic sprinter Florence Griffith Joyner's emotional testimony that her 
husband's "happy-go-lucky" demeanor changed for the worse after an incident 
with Los Angeles Police officers brought to a close Al Joyner's week-long trial 
for damages. 
</P>
<P>
 The jury of five men and three women began deliberations after earlier hearing 
from Griffith Joyner that the May 8, 1992, incident caused her husband to 
withdraw from family life and abandon his bid to qualify for the 1992 Olympic 
Games. 
</P>
<P>
 The four officers have already been found to have violated Joyner's civil 
rights when they misread his car's license plates and ordered him out of the 
car at gunpoint. The jury will decide what damages, if any, the officers are 
liable to pay. 
</P>
<P>
 In his closing statement to the jury, Joyner's attorney, John C. Burton, 
claimed the officers singled out Joyner because he "was a young black man in a 
nice car." Burton asked the jury for up to $4.5 million in damages. 
</P>
<P>
 Dept. City Attorney Victor Alexandroff argued that Joyner showed no signs of 
trauma for the incident and was motivated by greed and was using the incident 
to gain free publicity. Miscellany

ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD

<TEXT>
<P>
 The NFL schedule-maker has created a hardship for the Raiders. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 How shocking. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 They are taking their two longest trips of the season, to New England and 
Miami, during consecutive weeks. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the best Dolphin team in a while because they can stop the run," said 
Miami talk-show host and ESPN prognosticator Hank Goldberg. "Not that it takes 
much to stop the Raiders' rushing attack. This should be what I call a two-meal 
game. It will take a long time to play because there will be so much passing." 
. . . 
</P>
<P>
 "Don Shula is as good a coach as he ever was," Goldberg said. "None of that 
stuff about Jimmy Johnson replacing him was true. Don has a good relationship 
with Wayne Huizenga and he'll probably fulfill the last two years of his 
contract.". . .  
</P>
<P>
 Miami fans are so excited about the Dolphins that the remainder of the home 
schedule, except for the game against the Indianapolis Colts, is sold out. . . 
. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The quarterback draw, last seen executed on TV by the New York Giants' Dave 
Brown and the Raiders' Jeff Hostetler for touchdowns, always seems to work. . . 
. 
</P>
<P>
 Minnesota wide receiver Qadry Ismail's Monday was a lot more productive than 
older brother Rocket's Sunday. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Al Michaels neglected to mention it by name, but Hamilton High is the school 
that both he and Warren Moon attended. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Fashion note: Dan Reeves, a protege of Tom Landry, is the only NFL coach who 
wears a coat and tie. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The scary thing about the unbeaten San Diego Chargers is that they will play 
four of their last five games at home. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 This was supposed to be the year of the quarterback in the Pacific 10 
Conference. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 But only Steve Stenstrom of Stanford, who ranks third in the nation in total 
offense, is living up to his billing in the year of the Pac-10's 2-6 record 
against the Western Athletic Conference. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, Stenstrom will have the opportunity to pick on a porous USC 
secondary at Palo Alto. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 True freshman Brian Kelly might be the Trojans' best defensive back. He better 
be pretty good because he wears No. 42, which once belonged to Ronnie Lott. . . 
. 
</P>
<P>
 The Trojans would be wise to pound it out on the ground against the weak 
Stanford defense and keep the ball away from Stenstrom. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA is fortunate that it won't have to face Oregon State freshman quarterback 
Tim Alexander, who was outstanding in relief against USC until he suffered a 
broken collarbone in the fourth quarter. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The Bruins shouldn't be worried that they will get booed Saturday at the Rose 
Bowl. They should be worried that there won't be enough fans in the stadium to 
make a lot of noise. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Rick Neuheisel is getting rave notices for his work with quarterback Kordell 
Stewart at Colorado, but another ex-Bruin assistant coach, Alabama offensive 
coordinator Homer Smith, is getting roasted by fans who don't think the 
unbeaten Crimson Tide is scoring enough points. . . . 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 No jockey in Southern California has been riding as hard and as well in recent 
months as Corey Nakatani, who has started the Oak Tree meet with 14 victories 
in six days. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 A couple of females, Hollywood Wildcat and Flanders, might be the two most 
dominant horses on Breeders' Cup Day. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The pay-per-view fight card from the new, 52,000-seat Wembley Stadium in Hong 
Kong will begin at 10 a.m. Sunday, Oct. 23. That's 7 p.m. Saturday, Oct. 22, 
our time. The format is U.S. vs. Great Britain and one of the four fights will 
be Rafael Ruelas' defense of the International Boxing Federation lightweight 
title against Billy Schwer. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Humberto (Chiquita) Gonzalez-Michael Carbajal III has been signed for Nov. 12 
at Mexico City on a card that will include Genaro Hernandez's return to the 
ring against Jimmy Garcia. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Channel 2 sportscaster Jim Hill has been elected to the board of directors of 
the local chapter of the Urban League. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 According to a study conducted by the UCLA Anderson Graduate School of 
Management, major sporting events in the L.A. area last year pumped $2 billion 
into the local economy. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Three thousand voters polled by the L.A. Sports Council will decide what 
events are included in "Unforgettable: The 100 Greatest Moments in Los Angeles 
Sports History," to be published late next year. . . .

<P>
 Because of the presence of a certain .202 hitter, the Birmingham Barons led 
all Class AA baseball teams in home attendance with 467,867. . . .

GAME

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Orange Bowl Committee, eager to secure a prominent role in the new bowl 
alliance, agreed Tuesday to move its game to Joe Robbie Stadium after the 1996 
regular season. 
</P>
<P>
 At least two conference commissioners in the alliance said they wanted the 
game moved to eliminate the possibility of a home-field advantage for the Miami 
Hurricanes in a national championship game at the Orange Bowl.Other supporters 
of the move said Joe Robbie Stadium, with its sky boxes and club seats, is a 
more appropriate setting for such a major event. 
</P>
<P>
 The alliance indicated that unless the Orange Bowl moved, the game would be 
excluded from the planned rotation of top-tier postseason games in favor of the 
Gator Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange Bowl has been home to the annual holiday game since the 1930s.

 Nebraska Coach Tom Osborne said he might not know until Saturday if Brook 
Berringer can play against No. 16 Kansas State. Berringer suffered a partially 
collapsed left lung in Nebraska's 42-32 victory over Wyoming on Oct. 1. The 
same lung partially collapsed again last week in a 32-3 victory over Oklahoma 
State and doctors are monitoring his recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 3 quarterback Matt Turman will play Saturday if Berringer can't. Backing 
up Turman is second-team wingback Clester Johnson.

COLLEGE FOOTBALL DAILY REPORT; UCLA; AYERS RARELY SUFFERS FROM BOREDOM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Busiest Bruin? It might well be Derek Ayers, who is a slot receiver, still 
takes an occasional turn at tailback in practice and is on the kickoff, kickoff 
receiving and punt receiving teams. 
</P>
<P>
 "It makes you keep your head in the game," Ayers said. "You have to know the 
down and the distance, because when it's third down you have to be warming up 
and ready to go in." 
</P>
<P>
 Ayers returns kickoffs, and his 23.1 yards per return this season is second in 
the Pacific 10. 
</P>
<P>
 The last UCLA player with a better average was Darryl Henley, who had a 
23.3-yard average in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
 Ayers usually works in tandem with freshman Jim McElroy on the kickoff team. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm the call guy and he's the backup guy," Ayers said of the division of 
duties. "Most teams like to kick to the right corner, so the ball seems to come 
my way a lot." 
</P>
<P>
 McElroy has yet to return a kickoff. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Left guard James Christensen returned to full-contact practice after sitting 
out three games because of a partial tear in a knee ligament. . . . One reason 
for UCLA's slide: After six games last season, the Bruins were plus-16 in 
turnovers and this year they are minus-6. . . . More reasons: Only Daron 
Washington has a run of at least 30 yards, and he did that in the opener 
against Tennessee. The Bruins went from the Tennessee game to the California 
game, six weeks, without a run of 20 or more yards. Only Kevin Jordan has 
caught a pass for at least 25 yards. He has three catches of 50 or more yards, 
but none since the Nebraska game four weeks ago. . . . Of the 13 field goals 
Bjorn Merten has tried this season, 10 have come from 40 or more yards. He is 
four for 10 from that distance, six for 13 overall. JIM HODGES

 Coach John Robinson said he is so alarmed at the increasing number of injuries 
in college football that he has altered USC's practice schedule.  
</P>
<P>
 "When we lost Phalen Pounds (sidelined because of a knee injury) and John 
Allred (broken leg) in two days in practice, it changed me," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're just not going to have as many physical drills as we should."

 Rob Johnson, three days after being unable to start at quarterback for the 
first time in two seasons, took most of the snaps in practice Tuesday and 
showed no signs of favoring the right ankle that was sprained in the Oregon 
game. Johnson said the ankle felt better. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 Stanford Coach Bill Walsh, on his team's 36-35 loss at Arizona State last 
Saturday, on a field goal with six seconds to go: 
</P>
<P>
 "As a coach, you try to make college football a lasting experience for these 
players, and I think we did that . . . none of them will ever forget that 
game." 
</P>
<P>
 On a conference call to reporters Tuesday, Walsh -- whose team will play USC 
on Saturday in Palo Alto -- said of his 1-3-1 team: "Statistically, we look 
good. We're completing a lot of passes. All those things are there, and we're 
not winning. We had a 41-41 game and a 36-35 game and didn't win either one. 
It's tough. We expected a solid year and it's not happening." *

LOS ALAMITOS; IT'S BEEN TIME TO BET THE RANCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STACY PIGOTT, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Legacy Ranch has raced many good horses, among them three-time distance 
champion Griswold and his brother, Apprehend, a champion aged gelding. The 
Chino ranch was 12th on the national list of owners of leading money earners 
last year, and owns Merridoc, fifth among leading sires of money earners in 
1993. 
</P>
<P>
 So it was surprising when Legacy Ranch failed to win a major stakes race 
through the first 4 1/2 months of the 1994 Los Alamitos meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was very frustrating," said Pete Parella, co-owner of Legacy Ranch with 
Jerry Moreland. "It was really tough for us for a while. We've been doing 
everything the same as in past years, and it seemed everything was going wrong 
for us. It just wasn't working." 
</P>
<P>
 Legacy Ranch's drought ended in September, when the stakes victories started 
pouring in. 
</P>
<P>
 The 3-year-old Merridoc gelding, Daily Triple, gave Legacy its ice breaker in 
the $85,000 Governor's Cup Derby on Sept. 9. Daily Triple, part of an entry 
with Movados, was lightly regarded in the derby field, despite having won the 
Kindergarten Futurity last year, and was sent off at 25-1. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought we were better than 25-1," Parella said. "(Daily Triple) ran a good 
race in the trials and I thought he was due to win one. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have good horses and good trainers. It was only a matter of time." 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly thereafter, Parella was talking about his next stakes entrant, 
Griswold, who was scheduled to start in the Katella Handicap on Sept. 17. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's been doing everything we ask of him," Parella said. "I think Griswold 
will run a big race in the Katella Handicap." 
</P>
<P>
 The 8-year-old gelding, also by Merridoc, is trying for his fourth consecutive 
championship season in 1994. Earlier this year, he had met strong competition 
from multiple stakes winner Mr Diddy Wa Diddy, who defeated Griswold in the Pat 
Hyland Memorial Handicap in August. 
</P>
<P>
 As Parella predicted, Griswold followed Daily Triple's victory with one in the 
$20,000 Katella Handicap. Griswold held off the closing charge of Mr Diddy Wa 
Diddy and won the 870-yard race by a nose, earning $11,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, on Oct. 7, for the third time in less than a month, Legacy Ranch was in 
the winner's circle after a stake, this time with Movados in the $80,000 
California Derby. 
</P>
<P>
 Movados had been running a strong stakes schedule, finishing seventh in the 
competitive Los Alamitos Derby, in which the first six finishers were separated 
by half a length; second to Artesias Special Gal in the Southern California 
Derby, and fifth to stablemate Daily Triple in the Governor's Cup Derby. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought that of (Daily Triple and Movados), Movados was the better horse," 
Parella said. "I don't know why he didn't fire (in the Governor's Cup Derby)." 
</P>
<P>
 Movados, still another Merridoc gelding, was sent off at 6-1 in the California 
Derby. Jumping Tac Flash was the favorite. The talented filly is generally 
unpredictable, showing flashes of speed and brilliance between tantrums at the 
starting gates. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1993 champion 2-year-old filly caused only minimal problems before the 
California Derby, showing only slight reluctance to enter the gate. But Parella 
said that was all the edge Movados needed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't know if we could beat Jumping Tac Flash," Parella said. "That was 
the horse I thought we had to beat. When she wouldn't load, I thought we had 
her beat. It was a gut instinct." 
</P>
<P>
 Movados quickly took the lead in the 400-yard race, widening the margin to 
half a length over Moo Vin First at the wire. 
</P>
<P>
 The first-place money of $33,600, combined with Daily Triple and Griswold's 
earnings, totaled $91,350 for Legacy Ranch. Not bad for a month's work. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our horses are starting to peak at the right time for us, so I hope we can 
catch a couple of more," Parella said. Los Alamitos Notes 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time in Los Alamitos history, there were three dead heats in the 
same race, the California Derby. Jumping Tac Flash and Comes A Storm tied for 
third, The Money Crunch and Untamed Heart tied for fifth, and Sean Casady and 
Her First Cin tied for seventh. . . . Refrigerator and Avison are scheduled to 
meet again in the $100,000 Los Alamitos Championship on Friday night.

 Coach Buddy Ryan assembled seven free agents to audition for injured Greg 
Davis' job. Afterward, Ryan said Todd Peterson would kick Sunday against the 
Redskins in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 "He got the ball up quick even when he was warming up," Ryan said of Peterson, 
who was given a physical later. "He was accurate, right down the middle on all 
his field-goal tries, and he kicked the ball off down to about the 
four-yard-line. He did everything like we wanted. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a small guy, but he's got a lot of power." 
</P>
<P>
 If a hitch develops with Peterson's physical condition, former New York Jets 
kicker Cary Blanchard will get the job, Ryan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis pulled his left hamstring trying to stop Kevin Williams' 87-yard kickoff 
return for a Dallas touchdown Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis has said he hoped to return this week, but Ryan said that idea was 
overly optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
 Peterson, 24, who enrolled at Navy but played his last two college seasons at 
Georgia, said he understood the system. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm paying my dues," he said. "I'm young, I think I'm getting better. All the 
feedback I've gotten has been positive, and really all I can do is hope that I 
come out of this with something a little more positive than last year and get a 
legitimate shot next year." 
</P>
<P>
 Cardinal running back Garrison Hearst will be activated for the game against 
the Redskins and will see his first action in a year. He tore up his left knee 
against the Redskins last Oct. 17. 
</P>
<P>
 To make room on the active roster for Hearst and Peterson, Ryan released 
running back Barry Word. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Philadelphia Eagles signed punter Bryan Barker, who spent the last four 
seasons with the Kansas City Chiefs. 
</P>
<P>
 Barker replaces rookie Mitch Berger, who was cut Monday after averaging 38 
yards on 25 punts. 
</P>
<P>
 Barker, 30, earned all-rookie honors in 1990 with the Chiefs, and spent this 
preseason with the Minnesota Vikings but was released Aug. 30. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Kansas City Coach Marty Schottenheimer said he believed quarterback Joe 
Montana would be ready for Monday's game and that he was limiting him in 
practice so he would not hurt his arm or shoulder by altering his throwing 
motion to favor his bruised hip. Tight end Keith Cash, who has developed into 
one of Montana's best targets, likely will be listed as doubtful because of a 
knee sprain. Nose tackle Dan Saleamua also has a knee sprain but probably will 
play. . . . Wide receiver Willie Green, averaging 16.7 yards per catch, was 
waived Tuesday by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Green, signed this season after 
spending three years with Detroit, had nine catches for 150 yards and no 
touchdowns for Tampa Bay. . . . The Cleveland Browns acquired cornerback 
Reginald Jones from the New Orleans Saints in exchange for an undisclosed draft 
choice. Jones, 25, in his fourth NFL season, sustained a knee injury in the 
Saints' season opener against the Kansas City Chiefs, and had arthroscopic 
surgery.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Running back Harvey Williams will play more because of his performance Sunday 
in the Raiders' 21-17 victory over New England. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams, who signed a one-year, $250,000 free-agent contract in April, gained 
a season-high 65 yards in 17 carries. He also caught three passes for 41 yards, 
including a middle screen pass that he turned into a 27-yard touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 So will Williams gain his first start Sunday at Miami? Coach Art Shell 
wouldn't say. 
</P>
<P>
 "The more that he sees the ball out there, the better he is going to get," 
Shell said. "Harvey did a lot of good things out there (against New England)." 
</P>
<P>
 Tyrone Montgomery, who has started the first five games, did not see much 
action against the Patriots as he carried only three times for seven yards. 
Fullback Tom Rathman carried four times for 13 yards, but he also caught three 
passes for 23 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Last season's starting tailback, Greg Robinson, is eligible to be activated 
off the physically unable to perform list this week after being sidelined with 
a knee injury that he suffered at the end of last season. Robinson has been 
running and going through light drills. 
</P>
<P>
 "We possibly could bring him off, but we have to talk to the trainers first," 
Shell said. "There's a chance that he may start working with the team. He'll 
have to work some with the scout team and see how he is after he gets banged 
around a little bit." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 After being ineffective throughout September, the Raiders had a different 
defensive approach against New England. With cornerback Albert Lewis and 
linebacker Rob Fredrickson in the starting lineup for the first time, the 
Raiders blitzed and played more man-to-man coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only did the Raiders get more aggressive, but they also showed a few 
twists in their pass coverages. On one play in the second half, they rushed 
Fredrickson from the outside while defensive lineman Nolan Harrison dropped 
back in coverage on Patriots' tight end Ben Coates. 
</P>
<P>
 Look for more of the same Sunday against Miami's Dan Marino. LONNIE WHITE

<P>
 Coach Chuck Knox released quarterback Jamie Martin and said he has not decided 
who will start at the position for the Rams against the New York Giants. 
</P>
<P>
 The team spent $9 million during the off-season to sign Chris Miller to a 
three-year contract, but Knox appears more enamored with backup Chris Chandler, 
who sat out last week's game with an ankle injury. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll wait for the medical report before making a decision," Knox said. 
</P>
<P>
 Why wait if Miller is healthy enough to start, as he was Sunday in Green Bay? 
Miller played the entire game against the Packers and completed 18 of 29 passes 
for 166 yards with two touchdowns and one interception. Did Chandler's winning 
performance against Kansas City three weeks ago push him ahead of Miller on 
Knox's depth chart? 
</P>
<P>
 Answers are expected today. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams brought in former Washington punter Kelly Goodburn for a physical 
examination, but it was only a precaution because the team now believes Sean 
Landeta will be ready to perform Sunday against the Giants, his former team. 
</P>
<P>
 Landeta, the NFC's No. 3 punter, showed remarkable improvement after injuring 
his shoulder Sunday. He is not expected to practice much of the week, but he 
showed coaches Tuesday that he was able to raise his arm, thereby allowing him 
to kick later this week with anticipated further improvement. T.J. SIMERS

NME TO BUY RIVAL CHAIN AMERICAN MEDICAL; ACQUISITIONS: THE $3.3-BILLION DEAL 
AIMS TO SPUR THE FIRM'S COMPETITIVENESS STATESIDE AND ABROAD. ANALYSTS' 
REACTIONS ARE MIXED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID R. OLMOS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 National Medical Enterprises, continuing its rapid recovery from a rash of 
legal and ethical troubles, said Tuesday that it will acquire rival hospital 
chain American Medical Holdings in a $3.3-billion deal that would give it 
considerable clout in two important markets: Southern California and southern 
Florida. 
</P>
<P>
 The new company would have $5.3 billion in combined revenue, 84 hospitals in 
13 states and overseas, and be better positioned to compete for vital contracts 
with health maintenance organizations and other insurers, company officials and 
analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
 But analysts' reactions to the deal were mixed. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Villwock, of Johnson Rice & Co. in New Orleans, praised the deal as "a 
tremendous operating merger" with "a lot of synergies" among the two companies' 
facilities in several states. 
</P>
<P>
 But Dean Witter Reynolds' Todd Richter said National Medical's move was "one 
of desperation. Putting NME and American Medical together doesn't get you the 
critical mass you need to survive in the future." 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the case, it's not quite the deal that National Medical Chairman 
Jeffrey Barbakow had set his sights on. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbakow had tried to negotiate a complicated three-way merger with 
Dallas-based American Medical and HealthTrust Inc. of Nashville. That deal was 
blocked by Columbia/HCA, the Louisville, Ky., health care titan, when it 
snapped up HealthTrust in a $5.4-billion deal announced a week ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Though National Medical and American Medical had been talking about a possible 
combination for months, the discussions took on increasing urgency after 
Columbia's deal was announced, according to a source close to the negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 But Barbakow called the America Medical deal "the very best transaction" 
available to the company and said it plans other acquisitions in the near 
future. 
</P>
<P>
 "You'll see a lot of deals quickly," he said. "We're looking at some big ones, 
but some small ones will be significant, too." 
</P>
<P>
 Barbakow said no decision has been made on where to locate the corporate 
offices, if the deal is completed. National Medical has been looking for a new 
headquarters for several months. Its Santa Monica offices were badly damaged in 
the Northridge earthquake in January, and it doesn't need as much office space 
after recent layoffs of corporate staffers. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbakow said the company will be renamed -- "but not NME" -- after the 
merger, though no name has yet been chosen. Observers said a new name would be 
a good strategy because the National Medical name has become synonymous with 
health care fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 National Medical has been struggling to overcome its negative image after a 
swamp of legal and other problems. In July, the company paid $380 million to 
settle federal criminal fraud charges and pleaded guilty to six counts of 
paying kickbacks for the referral of Medicare patients. It also paid more than 
$200 million to settle civil suits brought by insurers and former patients over 
allegations of fraud, overbilling and patient abuse, primarily involving the 
company's psychiatric hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
 National Medical has divested most of those facilities.  
</P>
<P>
 The merger would create especially strong operations in Southern California, 
which will produce half of the combined entity's revenue, and in southern 
Florida, Louisiana and Texas. 
</P>
<P>
 National Medical operates 15 hospitals in Southern California, including its 
Los Angeles flagships, Century City Hospital and USC University Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 American Medical operates five hospitals in Southern California: 
Encino-Tarzana Regional Medical Center, Garden Grove Hospital and Medical 
Center, Irvine Medical Center, the Medical Center of North Hollywood and South 
Bay Hospital in Redondo Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbakow said the merger would allow the company to negotiate better deals 
with health insurers because of the size and breadth of its facilities in 
Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a hospital in Century City and now we have ones in Tarzana and 
Encino, plus Orange County," he said. "We'll have the critical mass to go to 
the employers in Los Angeles and say, 'We have the following assets and 
services across Southern California.' " 
</P>
<P>
 But one health care executive says National Medical may still not have enough 
facilities in the huge Los Angeles market to gain the marketplace clout it 
seeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't seen any HMOs that are willing to sign a contract with one medical 
system," said Terry Hartshorne, chief executive of UniHealth America, a 
Burbank-based health care company that owns nine hospitals in Southern 
California. "This marketplace is so complex and competitive now that 15 
hospitals isn't a big enough critical mass to create much of anything." 
</P>
<P>
 The $3.3-billion valuation for American Medical includes the assumption of 
about $1.3 billion in debt by National Medical. The Santa Monica-based firm 
will have to borrow heavily to finance part of the deal, but Barbakow said he 
is confident that the company will generate enough cash to quickly reduce the 
debt. 
</P>
<P>
 National Medical shares fell by 62.5 cents to $15.625 Tuesday in heavy New 
York Stock Exchange trading. American Medical shares rose by $1.625 to $24. 
</P>
<P>
 Until 1990, American Medical was based in Beverly Hills. Its chairman and 
chief executive, Robert W. O'Leary, is former head of the St. Joseph Health 
System, a not-for-profit, nine-hospital chain based in Orange. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Leary and John T. Casey, American Medical's president and chief operating 
officer, will become co-vice chairmen on National Medical's board. National 
Medical Merger 
</P>
<P>
 The combination of National Medical Enterprises and American Medical 
International would double NME's revenue and more than double its number of 
hospitals to 84, but the new firm would still be far behind the giant 
Columbia/HCA Healthcare Corp., which would have 311 hospitals under a pending 
merger. Here's what the combined company would look like: 
</P>
<P>
 * Revenue: $5.28 billion 
</P>
<P>
 * General hospitals: 84 
</P>
<P>
 * Geographic concentration: California, Texas, Florida 
</P>
<P>
 * Employees: 63,200 
</P>
<P>
 * Headquarters: Santa Monica 
</P>
<P>
 * Chief executive: Jeffrey Barbakow

DOW CLIMBS 55.51 ON PROFIT REPORTS AND RALLY IN BONDS; MARKETS: THE ADVANCE, 
LED BY TECHNOLOGY AND ECONOMY-SENSITIVE STOCKS, IS ONE OF THE BIGGEST OF THE 
YEAR. THE DOLLAR CLOSES MIXED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Stocks moved sharply higher for a third consecutive session Tuesday, helped by 
good corporate earnings reports, a bond market rally and the belief that 
inflation and interest rates are no longer immediate concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 In one of its biggest single-day advances of the year, the Dow Jones 
industrial average rose 55.51 points to 3,876.83, while in the broader market, 
advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 7 to 3 on the New York Stock 
Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 Once again, technology issues and stocks most sensitive to swings in the 
economy led Wall Street higher. 
</P>
<P>
 Motorola, Chrysler and PepsiCo posted stronger-than-expected third-quarter 
profits, adding to optimism about the entire earnings reporting season and the 
economy. Profit reporting begins in earnest next week. 
</P>
<P>
 * Motorola rose 1 3/8 to 54 1/8, Chrysler jumped 5/8 to 46 1/2 and PepsiCo 
rose 2 1/4 to 34 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
 "The focus has shifted from worries about inflation and interest rates to the 
economy and earnings," said Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer at First 
Albany Corp. "Companies are beginning to see the payoffs of the past few years 
of restructuring and a stronger-than-expected recovery in Europe." 
</P>
<P>
 The bond market picked up on that sentiment, with the bellwether 30-year 
Treasury bond yield retreating to 7.86% from 7.90%. Its price, which rises when 
rates fall, went up 7/16 point, or $4.38 per $1,000 in face value. 
</P>
<P>
 Bond traders said large investors, who were off Monday for Columbus Day, 
returned to buy bonds on confidence that the nation's economy is losing steam, 
which made Treasury securities seem like a good deal at current yields. Many 
were exchanging medium-term notes for long-term maturities. 
</P>
<P>
 The lower interest rates were encouraging to stock investors because they cut 
the cost of money to companies and make shares more attractive relative to 
interest-bearing investments. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the dollar -- viewed as a safe-haven currency in times of military 
conflicts -- ended mixed as Persian Gulf tensions receded. But the currency 
remained at recent high levels, making dollar-denominated assets such as 
Treasury bonds seem more attractive to investors. 
</P>
<P>
 In New York trading, the dollar closed at 1.546 German marks, up from 1.545 on 
Monday and at 100.25 Japanese yen, down from 100.35. 
</P>
<P>
 In part, Friday's employment report allowed stock investors to focus on 
earnings and bond investors to stop worrying about inflation, Johnson said. 
That data showed employment was up but that wages were not rising. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow's advance triggered the NYSE "downtick rule," which limits program 
buying. 
</P>
<P>
 Big Board volume was a hefty 355.54 million shares, up from Monday's 213.21 
million, which was held down by the holiday. 
</P>
<P>
 Among broader market indexes, the NYSE's composite index rose 3.24 points 
256.38. The Standard & Poor's 500 rose 6.76 points to 465.80, while the Nasdaq 
composite index of mostly smaller issues rose 8.76 points to 765.57. 
</P>
<P>
 For a third day, stocks that investors believe will benefit most from the 
economic expansion led the market higher: autos, papers, chemicals and heavy 
machinery. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * General Motors rose 1 5/8 to 47 1/8 and Ford Motor added 1 1/8 to 29 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Procter & Gamble said it expects record sales for the quarter, and its 
shares shot up 2 1/2 to 62 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Apple Computer continued its recent climb, adding 3/4 to 39 5/8 after saying 
it expects it quarterly results to be above Wall Street forecasts. 
</P>
<P>
 * American Medical Holdings rose 1 5/8 to 24 on news of its merger with 
National Medical Enterprises Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 * Biogen Inc. tumbled 2 to 50 on Nasdaq after releasing data on its multiple 
sclerosis drug, beta interferon. CS First Boston downgraded Biogen to "hold" 
from "buy," saying the data was "good but not outstanding." 
</P>
<P>
 * Chiron, which has a rival MS drug, jumped 4 to 65. 
</P>
<P>
 * Caterpillar rose 2 3/8 to 55 5/8 and DuPont rose 5/8 to 58 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Novell rose 1 1/4 to 15 3/4 and Dell Computer rose 2 to 41 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
 The market gained some impetus from higher stock prices abroad. In Europe, 
Germany's 30-share DAX average shot up 46.27 points to 2,071.06, while London's 
Financial Times 100-share average gained 40.7 points to close at 3,073.0. 
</P>
<P>
 Tokyo's Nikkei 225 average closed up 76.71 points at 19,821.46. Mexico City's 
Bolsa index rose 1.68%, or 43.96 points, to 2665.59. 
</P>
<P>
 Gold retreated $3.10 on New York's Comex to settle at $387.60 an ounce. It was 
the first time gold had fallen below $390 an ounce in six weeks, helping to 
push the Commodity Research Bureau's index of 21 commodity futures to a 
three-month low of 227.29. The index closed at 227.88.

ISSUE OF UNIVERSAL ACCESS SPLITS READERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Last week, The Cutting Edge asked for readers' thoughts on whether universal 
access to communications services -- a staple of national communications policy 
for many decades -- can or should be preserved in an age when competition and 
new technology are changing the cost structure of basic telephone and 
television services and making many new services available. 
</P>
<P>
 Should emerging telecommunications providers give subsidies to low-income 
consumers, or can the free market be counted on to make these services 
available to all? How should such subsidies be provided? Should the principle 
of universal service be extended to new electronic information services, and if 
so, by what mechanism? 
</P>
<P>
 The mail was almost evenly divided between those who favor some kind of 
support for universal service and those who are opposed. Many respondents 
singled out the public libraries as a logical avenue for providing broad access 
to electronic information services. 
</P>
<P>
 Below is a sampling of the responses. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Historically, universal service has been defined as minimal, or "lifeline," 
service. It has never implied full access to the broad spectrum of available 
services. 
</P>
<P>
 It seems inappropriate to isolate the challenge of universal service as it 
applies to electronic information services when non-electronic information 
services such as newspapers, books and magazines are not offered to individuals 
under any type of universal access policy. Perhaps, as public libraries and 
schools provide a tax-driven method of accessing non-electronic information at 
no cost to the end user, they must take it upon themselves to offer a no-cost 
method of accessing electronic information. 
</P>
<P>
 To subsidize access to electronic information services on an individual basis 
is inconsistent with the public policies regarding non-electronic information 
already in place.

 Universal service benefits the very young and the very old. Television is the 
American baby-sitter and the nation's companion for the elderly. Telephones are 
the lifeline of the aged and the comline of teen-agers. Subsidies to provide 
universal telecommunications service will allow entry of creative (if 
penniless) youngsters and tap the information wellspring of the mature.

 I am very much opposed to passing the cost of services for the poor along to 
the rest of the users in the form of higher rates. The true effect of that 
would be to separate a group of people from access because they are not "poor" 
enough to qualify for subsidies and not "well off" enough to shoulder someone 
else's bill in addition to their own. If there truly is a need to assist the 
low-income people in this area, it should come out of the general tax rolls to 
which everyone pays a proportion relative to their means.

 The benefits of furnishing universal service far outweigh the costs to all of 
us since empowerment of our citizens in our democratic society is vital for its 
survival. All of us should be willing to share whatever resources we can to 
enable a general format accessible to every American and possibly all world 
citizens.

 Subsidies are killing our countries in more ways than one. To provide basic 
necessities like food, education and shelter is certainly one of my moral 
imperatives -- subsidized access to electronic info services is not. Why work 
hard and save money to afford high-tech goodies if the government (i.e., 
taxpayers) are going to give them to you anyway?

 "Can Universal Service Be Preserved in Information Age?" Yes, it must be or 
the divide between haves and have-nots will be even more extreme. However, the 
free market is not likely to help. Even tax credits would probably not be 
enough. Possibly a tax on each item (hardware, software both) could bring 
income enough for subsidies. The public libraries as well as schools must be 
involved in providing the how-to for the computer illiterate of all ages.

 It is obvious that we must guarantee universal access to the information 
superhighway to everyone regardless of means. We will soon have access to over 
500 channels of cable service which will bring us much closer to the 
universally cherished goal of having reruns of "Gilligan's Island," "The Love 
Boat" and "I Love Lucy" running 24 hours a day. Who can really say they 
understand American culture and society unless they've seen every episode of 
Gilligan's Island? 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, the Internet will play an increasing role in our lives. Profound 
discussions are going on right now in areas such as alt.sex.bestiality, 
alt.barney.die.die.die and the numerous Star Trek discussions that permeate the 
Internet. 
</P>
<P>
 With other problems, such as national, state, local and personal debt, crime, 
the coming bankruptcy of Medicare and Social Security, drug addiction, 
homelessness, crumbling of the family . . . devastation of our inner cities, 
etc. -- obviously less important than providing universal access to the 
information superhighway -- we should focus our resources on that. After all, 
if the people of our nation are properly entertained, they may not notice the 
other problems.

 With the proliferation of new technology and the deregulation of the 
telecommunications industry, it will be impossible to guarantee universal 
access. Any attempt at forcing companies to subsidize services will impede the 
speed of products getting to the marketplace and will create larger 
bureaucracies to administer the new laws. 
</P>
<P>
 Increased competition, not government interference, will lower the prices and 
open the access to underserved areas. The market is the answer.

 If the ensuing information age is as revolutionary as suggested, then it is 
imperative that if I have access, than so should my neighbor, and my neighbor's 
neighbor, etc. There is already too great a gap between the haves and the 
have-nots without the information age. We cannot allow it to widen. It is the 
responsibility of the John Malones of the world -- acting as humans if not 
businessmen -- to ensure such access. And if they do not have it in their 
ethical standards, then let the government step in and demand it.

BOOK REVIEW / NONFICTION; A CLOSE-UP VIEW OF ANOTHER KIND OF NATURAL 
DESTRUCTION; THE SCARIEST PLACE ON EARTH: EYE TO EYE WITH HURRICANES BY DAVID 
E. FISHER ; RANDOM HOUSE$23, 250 PAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Here in California, we worry about earthquakes, brush fires and floods, but 
David E. Fisher's "The Scariest Place on Earth" is about a natural disaster of 
an entirely different magnitude. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let me tell you," he writes, "about hurricanes." 
</P>
<P>
 A hurricane killed more than half a million people in the Bay of Bengal in 
1970 -- "more than were killed at Hiroshima and Nagasaki and Dresden and London 
combined ," Fisher points out. And a hurricane is a perfectly routine 
meteorological phenomenon that beggars the destructive power of human 
technology: "The energy released in just one decent-sized hurricane is as much 
as that in 500,000 atom bombs." 
</P>
<P>
 Lest we take ourselves and our natural perils too seriously, Fisher invites us 
to spend a few days of terror in South Florida: "The scariest place on earth," 
he insists, "is directly in the path of an onrushing category 5 hurricane." 
</P>
<P>
 That's where Fisher and millions of other Floridians found themselves in 1992 
when Hurricane Andrew roared through Miami and then headed toward Louisiana, 
leaving a path of devastation that has been characterized as twice as 
destructive as the 1994 Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Fisher's book is a dramatic, day-by-day account of Hurricane Andrew, but it's 
also an opportunity for the author to explore the natural history of hurricanes 
in rich and fascinating detail. Fisher explains how and why hurricanes happen, 
how they are tracked and measured, and, intriguingly, what we may be able to do 
to control or eliminate them -- someday. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Scariest Place on Earth" harks all the way back to Genghis Khan, whose 
invasion of Japan in 1274 was foiled by a typhoon -- and Fisher pauses to 
explain that a typhoon is what hurricanes are called when they occur in the 
Pacific Ocean rather than in the Atlantic Ocean. 
</P>
<P>
 Then Fisher zips forward to World War II, when Adm. "Bull" Halsey relied on 
some misinterpreted weather data in ordering a task force to sail directly into 
a monster typhoon -- an error in judgment that resulted in the loss of three 
warships and nearly 800 sailors. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortuitously, the early efforts to predict weather at sea in World War II -- 
and the availability of war-surplus ships and planes after the war -- led to 
rapid progress in the study of hurricanes, and so did the 
intelligence-gathering in the upper atmosphere during the era of nuclear 
testing. Still, as recently as 1956, hurricanes were still described by one 
scientist as "one of the great mysteries of the sea." 
</P>
<P>
 "Today, we know pretty well how a hurricane works," Fisher deadpans. "How to 
stop it is another matter." 
</P>
<P>
 With the assistance of a collection of drawings that may remind you of a high 
school science textbook, Fisher explains how the Earth's climate is governed by 
the temperature and movement of both air and water. Some terms that we may know 
only from literature and poetry -- the trade winds, the doldrums, the horse 
latitudes -- are given new meaning in the context of meteorology, and we learn 
that "between the doldrums and the horse latitudes is where hurricanes form." 
</P>
<P>
 Fisher is described by his publisher as a novelist, a playwright, an actor and 
a scientist who specializes in marine geology, environmental science and 
something called "cosmochemistry." His background may help to explain his 
engaging prose style; he is one science writer who invokes the poetry of 
William Butler Yeats and the Second Law of Thermodynamics with the same ease 
and grace. 
</P>
<P>
 The account of Hurricane Andrew is peppered with bursts of outrage about the 
terrible but unnecessary destruction that resulted from lack of preparedness. 
According to Fisher, the strict building codes in South Florida were 
"practically guaranteed to make buildings hurricane-proof," but the fact that 
no hurricanes had hit Florida since 1966 resulted in a dangerous complacency. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hate to be cynical or mean-spirited," writes the otherwise easygoing 
Fisher, "but I just could not see all those Florida building contractors 
obeying the construction code every year and spending money to make buildings 
safe against a hurricane that hadn't come since God-knew-when." 
</P>
<P>
 "The Scariest Place on Earth" will be reassuring to some readers in Southern 
California -- hurricanes, after all, are one natural disaster we don't have to 
worry about. But Fisher's fulminations about preparedness in general, and 
disaster-proof building construction in particular, hold a special resonance in 
a place where apartment buildings and parking structures and freeway overpasses 
shouldn't have fallen down in an earthquake -- but did.

MEDFLY PROJECT PLANS OFFICE IN CAMARILLO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE FIELDS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 From a row of temporary beige trailers in an industrial section of Los Angeles 
County, leaders of the Cooperative Medfly Project plot strategies for some of 
the state's most unpopular wars. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1974, they have tracked, trapped, dissected and set out to eliminate the 
most damaging of the winged pests that threaten California's $19.9-billion 
farming industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, using an arsenal that includes computers and aerial photographs, the 
project's members are making plans to attack the fly in Ventura County -- site 
of the latest infestation. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been working on the Medfly problem in Los Angeles for a number of 
years," said John Stewart, project manager for Ventura County's infestation. 
"We've got the people. We've got the expertise." 
</P>
<P>
 The project, which operates a hot line for the public, is also bracing for a 
flood of phone calls from agitated residents in Camarillo where aerial spraying 
is scheduled to begin tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tomorrow, the number of calls are going to skyrocket," said Chris Tejada, 
supervisor of the project's phone bank. The project expects to open an office 
in Camarillo this week, the latest of 11 satellite offices statewide. 
</P>
<P>
 Conceived as a temporary marriage of federal, state and local officials, the 
project was set up to identify an outbreak, recommend a course of action and 
monitor the results. 
</P>
<P>
 With a fleet of 300 cars and a payroll of 450 permanent and seasonal 
employees, the project has the resources to mobilize workers and equipment 
quickly. The first priority is to determine the size and extent of an outbreak; 
the second is to try to stop it. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Consider the response in Ventura County: 
</P>
<P>
 Within 48 hours of when the first two female Medflies were found, workers hung 
hundreds of sticky, yellow traps in trees. They checked bushels of fruit for 
maggots and larvae. And they carried backpack equipment to spray by hand a 
one-mile area around the site of the original find. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even one wild Medfly we want to know about," said project spokesman Doug 
Hendrix. "We had to pool all available resources when we found them in that 
area." 
</P>
<P>
 As of Tuesday, the traps had yielded a total of 61 more wild Medflies. 
</P>
<P>
 Project officials said they recommended aerial spraying over the Camarillo 
area because of the extent of the outbreak and its location. 
</P>
<P>
 Although it was set up to tackle short-term outbreaks, the Cooperative Medfly 
Project has operated almost nonstop in recent years. Since 1987, at least one 
new Medfly outbreak has appeared each year in areas south of Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 And in 1993, after aerial and ground spraying failed to wipe out the pest in 
Los Angeles, the project launched a two-year experiment to breed the bug out of 
existence. Now, about 500 million sterile Medflies are released each week over 
Los Angeles, San Bernardino and Orange counties. 
</P>
<P>
 That eradication effort, which covers 1,500 square miles, is expected to cost 
$35 million this year. 
</P>
<P>
 No one knows yet what the tab will be for the Ventura County outbreak, 
although each night of malathion spraying will cost about $90,000, said Larry 
Hawkins, a project spokesman. All of the costs are split evenly between the 
U.S. Department of Agriculture and the California Department of Food and 
Agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
 In April, the project moved to its present site within a massive complex of 
federal warehouses where airplane parts were assembled during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 The project's headquarters consists of 15 temporary beige and brown buildings 
hobbled together with elevated walkways that are shielded overhead by cloth 
tarps. 
</P>
<P>
 In a long conference room at the project's headquarters -- the closest thing 
to a strategy room -- a large aerial photograph of northeast Camarillo sits on 
an easel. The photo's center is sprinkled with red dots, one for every wild 
Medfly trapped. Blue and orange dots cover a larger area indicating food lure 
and pheromone traps. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Other buildings in the complex house labs devoted to identifying fly and 
larvae found in the Los Angeles Basin and, now, in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside the fly identification section, workers hunch over microscopes, probing 
dead flies with tweezers. The sterile Medflies, bred in Hawaii, emit a red dye 
when their heads are squeezed. If a fly does not glow red, it is examined by 
the project's on-site entomologist and then sent to Sacramento for confirmation 
as a wild Medfly. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the project's veterans began as seasonal workers, joining the task 
force only when needed. 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin Talbert, supervisor of the identification section, said his first job 
with the project involved examining hundreds of dead flies under a microscope 
for hours at a time. 
</P>
<P>
 "At that time I remember dreaming about flies," he said. "I guess it could 
take the place of counting sheep." 
</P>
<P>
 A few trailers away, in a room with a heavy scent of citrus, five project 
employees spend their day slicing into ripened fruit collected from throughout 
quarantine areas. The fruit is examined about a week after it is collected to 
check for the presence of Medfly larvae. 
</P>
<P>
 Holding a ripe orange in his gloved hand, Ramon Leyva sliced through the top 
and examined the pinwheel of fruit that fell into his tray. 
</P>
<P>
 It is easy, he said, to spot fruit eaten away by the larvae. Finding such a 
fruit can cause a stir within the room that is sealed and kept at a cool 
temperature. 
</P>
<P>
 "After hours of slicing fruit, we get a big thrill out of it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 For all the project's money and expertise, officials say the success of 
eradication efforts depends on the public. A single piece of tainted fruit 
could bring the Medfly back. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got the technology to eradicate the fly, but there's always the issue 
of reintroduction," said Hendrix, the project spokesman. "It's not a program we 
can walk away from."

OXNARD SEES ITS SHORTFALL DISAPPEARING; BUDGET: CITY OFFICIALS PREDICT 
RESOLUTION OF ECONOMIC PROBLEMS SOON, THOUGH FORECAST FOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIGUEL BUSTILLO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Oxnard will bridge its chronic budget shortfall by next year, according to a 
rosy six-year economic prognosis unveiled Tuesday by city officials. 
</P>
<P>
 The layoffs of 38 city workers in the past year, combined with a slight state 
and federal economic upturn, have put Oxnard in a better-than-expected 
position, said Oxnard management analyst Dennis Scala. 
</P>
<P>
 But the forecast, based on statewide reports by the Center for Continuing 
Study of the California Economy and the John E. Anderson Graduate School of 
Management at UCLA, concluded that Oxnard will continue to experience weaker 
economic growth than other parts of the country. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have resolved potential shortfalls by deliberate and painful efforts to 
reduce our appropriations and re-engineer the way we do business, rather than 
from a substantial increase in our revenue base," Scala said in a report to the 
Oxnard City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard is expected to spend $61.4 million in the 1995-96 budget year, up from 
$60.2 million this year. Since the city should take in about $61.3 million, 
balancing the budget will require only minor cuts, Scala said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Tom Holden said he was impressed by the forecast. 
</P>
<P>
 "While most other cities are cutting services to balance their budgets, we 
have found another way to do things," Holden said. "That's not to minimize the 
lost positions, but our ability to provide services is our top priority." 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1990, Oxnard has pared its work force from 1,100 to 913, mostly by not 
replacing departing employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the conclusions of the forecast are that: 
</P>
<P>
 * New commercial developments such as the Shopping at the Rose complex and the 
Oxnard Factory Outlet Mall have boosted the city's sales tax revenues, but not 
enough to offset the money lost during the recession. 
</P>
<P>
 * The jobs being created in Oxnard, like those in the rest of the state, are 
mostly low-paying service jobs that cannot replace the higher-paying, 
defense-related jobs that have been lost. 
</P>
<P>
 * State budgetary problems could result in further reduced revenue for Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 * The possible closure or downsizing of one or more of Ventura County's 
military bases would have a devastating impact on Oxnard's economy. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Although council members said they were pleased by the positive forecast, they 
asked city staff members to base spending proposals on a pessimistic prognosis 
-- one that does not predict economic recovery until the year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Mike Plisky said Oxnard should always prepare for the worst. That 
way, the city will not have to slash jobs and programs at the last minute as 
council members have in recent years, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there are too many unknowns out there at this point, especially with 
the state," Plisky said. The state has cut local funding in recent years to 
balance its budget.  
</P>
<P>
 The report also listed some potential impacts, but called them unlikely. They 
were: 
</P>
<P>
 * The state again cuts funding to cities. 
</P>
<P>
 * The City Council opts to add police officers by matching funds available 
through the federal Crime Bill. 
</P>
<P>
 * Council members increase funding for $50 million worth of badly needed 
improvements to city streets, bridges and highway intersections. 
</P>
<P>
 If all those scenarios occurred, the city could face a $2-million deficit, 
Scala said.

SUPERVISORS ORDER AUDIT OF JOBS AGENCY; INQUIRY: THE BOARD CALLS IT A ROUTINE 
MEASURE. BUT A SOURCE SAYS THE ACTION IS TAKEN AS THE STATE WINDS DOWN A PROBE 
OF THE COUNCIL'S CONTRACTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The Board of Supervisors ordered an audit of Ventura County's job-training 
agency Tuesday as state investigators probed possible criminal fraud by agency 
officials suspected of illegally awarding contracts to friends and associates, 
The Times has learned. 
</P>
<P>
 County supervisors said they approved an audit of the Job Training Policy 
Council's financial records as a routine measure, since the panel distributes 
millions of dollars in federal funds each year and the county must make sure 
the money is spent properly. 
</P>
<P>
 The board, however, took the action as state investigators are winding down a 
two-month probe of the job agency's contracts, a source close to the 
investigation said. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators may request criminal charges from the state attorney general's 
office within several weeks, the source said, or the state Employment 
Development Department could impose administrative penalties. 
</P>
<P>
 The state employment agency monitors how local job councils spend federal 
training grants. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are several allegations and several contracts (under investigation)," 
the source said. 
</P>
<P>
 Two local officials interviewed by state investigator Carol Nolan confirmed 
they were asked about how the JTPC awards its contracts. And one, Oxnard city 
jobs coordinator Ephren Gore, said he believes "cronyism" permeates the 
agency's decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 Both said they expect to give sworn statements in the case soon. 
</P>
<P>
 The 20-member jobs council spends more than $11 million annually training poor 
people throughout the county to work. At monthly meetings, the council awards 
contracts to schools, cities and other agencies that promise to spend the money 
putting people to work. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, under amendments to a federal law effective this year, elected 
officials who appoint members of the jobs council can be held liable for 
financial improprieties of agency officials or employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Susan K. Lacey, who proposed the county audit along with Supervisor 
John K. Flynn, said previously the new audit was strictly the result of the new 
law. 
</P>
<P>
 But Tuesday, she conceded that she knew second-hand about the state's criminal 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have heard that, but we don't have any real knowledge of it," Lacey said. 
"We had this (audit proposal) all under way. During the process of doing this, 
that (state probe) came to light." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 State labor investigators have been in Ventura County for weeks, conducting 
private interviews of former and current members of the jobs council, its staff 
members and officials whose agencies have applied for grants. 
</P>
<P>
 The investigation is separate from previous federal inquiries into Job 
Training Policy Council activities throughout the 1980s. In one, the U.S. Labor 
Department concluded in 1993 that the jobs panel improperly spent more than 
$500,000, and ordered the money repaid. 
</P>
<P>
 Jobs council Chairwoman Jacqueline Richardson said subsequent reviews reduced 
that obligation to less than $5,000, which the council repaid. 
</P>
<P>
 Richardson said she knows nothing of the new inquiry. If one exists, she said, 
it was probably prompted by a disgruntled bidder passed over for a contract.

 "The state has an obligation to follow up any grievances, and the JTPC 
encourages any investigation whatsoever," Richardson said. "I feel comfortable 
that there is no misappropriation of funds." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 One witness in the probe said he was interviewed by the investigator in late 
August or early September. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're just looking into certain allegations . . . that were filed to the 
state or the federal agencies," said Jim Compton, a former member of the jobs 
council. 
</P>
<P>
 Compton said he was told that he would be asked to sign an affidavit regarding 
his knowledge of alleged improprieties within days. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't signed it, but I'm going to be asked to sign something soon," said 
Compton, director of occupational programs at the county superintendent of 
schools office. 
</P>
<P>
 The new investigation focuses on contracts awarded since January, 1990, when a 
former executive director of the jobs council was fired, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 John Chase, who had run the agency since its creation in 1984, was replaced 
amid allegations that he worked full time for two job training agencies at the 
same time, awarded federal contracts from one of the agencies to the other, and 
improperly awarded at least $10,000 to his own consulting firm. 
</P>
<P>
 A criminal inquiry into Chase's conduct, however, ended without charges in 
1992, when a county grand jury found insufficient evidence to press the case. 
Chase's conduct is not the subject of the current inquiry, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gore, the Oxnard employee who bids for jobs council contracts, said he told 
state investigators that the jobs council routinely practices favoritism in 
assigning grants. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he has had trouble getting fair treatment from some agency managers. 
Specifically, he complained about Executive Director Francisco De Leon, 
Programs Manager Roberto De La Selva and staff worker Armando Lopez. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's tremendous community support for this investigation," said Gore, who 
also said he expects to sign an affidavit soon. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're talking about control by three or four people," Gore said. "That's 
what they've been doing all these years. They've been burning people they don't 
like." 
</P>
<P>
 De Leon dismissed Gore's complaint. "Gore's probably not happy with some of 
the funding recommendations that we made," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The executive director said every jobs contract goes through a strict review 
before being awarded to the worthiest bidder. "Anytime you have competition, 
you have winners and losers," De Leon said. 
</P>
<P>
 County Auditor-Controller Thomas O. Mahon said the county audit will be 
conducted by his staff. It could be completed in as few as eight or 10 hours if 
auditors find nothing wrong, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "But if it ends up taking a considerable amount of time, then we would bill 
the JTPC," Mahon said.

TACONIC SPENT $335,000 FOR DUMP MEASURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLOS V. LOZANO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A group of San Diego investors that wants to build a garbage dump at the mouth 
of the Ojai Valley spent $335,000 in a failed four-month campaign to place the 
Weldon Canyon issue on the November ballot, according to campaign finance 
statements. 
</P>
<P>
 The investor partnership, Taconic Resources, spent nearly all of the money on 
attorneys and consultants in a legal and public relations battle, according to 
finance reports filed with the Ventura County elections office. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were well within our budget," said Jim Jevens, a Camarillo consultant 
hired to work on the Weldon project. "What was expended was actually about half 
of what was available to us." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite a judge's ruling in August that struck the landfill initiative from 
the November ballot, Jevens said the project is not dead and that Taconic 
Resources will pursue an appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 "We haven't dropped the ball," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, the Ojai Valley-based Coalition to Stop Weldon Canyon Dump spent 
about $21,000 on its efforts to fight the landfill. Most of its money went to 
pay for surveys, advertising and signature-gathering for a petition opposing 
the dump, said John Nava, an activist with the coalition. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the coalition said they were not surprised by the amount of money 
Taconic put into its campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're well-heeled entrepreneurs and gamblers who are willing to spend 
money," Nava said. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the name of Taconic's campaign committee -- Ventura Citizens for 
Environmental Solutions -- all of the money it received came from outside the 
county, Nava said. 
</P>
<P>
 California Landfill Development, Inc. of Boston gave the partnership $209,363, 
the single largest contribution, according to the committee's campaign finance 
report. Servcon-San Marcos Inc. of San Francisco was second with a contribution 
of $15,576. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're all out-of-county speculators," Nava said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Besides attorney fees, the committee spent about $100,000 on public relations 
consultants, polling and signature gathering for its landfill initiative. About 
32,000 county residents signed a petition last spring to place the measure on 
the November ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee paid Irvine consultant Mark Thompson nearly $40,000 for his 
services, according to its campaign finance statement. 
</P>
<P>
 Thompson, a longtime political consultant who has represented state Sen. 
Cathie Wright (R-Simi Valley) and other local politicians, is also working for 
the campaigns of Ventura County Supervisor candidates Scott Montgomery and 
Frank Schillo. Both candidates are ardent supporters of the Weldon Canyon dump, 
but have not received any money from Taconic. 
</P>
<P>
 Thompson could not be reached for comment Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Jevens said he was not aware that Thompson was working for the candidates, but 
said as a private consultant he was free to do as he wished. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have no idea what he's doing for Scott Montgomery or Frank Schillo, and I 
don't care," Jevens said. 
</P>
<P>
 Montgomery, a Moorpark councilman who so far has spent about $10,000 for 
Thompson's services, said he also did not see any conflict with Thompson's 
representation of Taconic. Montgomery is running for the 4th Supervisorial 
District seat being vacated by Vicky Howard, who represents Simi Valley and 
Moorpark. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's just an employee of mine," Montgomery said. "He's free to represent 
whoever he wants." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Schillo, a Thousand Oaks councilman who has paid Thompson about $5,000 for 
consulting services, was not available for comment Tuesday. Schillo is running 
for the 2nd Supervisorial District seat being vacated by Maria VanderKolk, who 
represents most of the Conejo Valley and Port Hueneme. 
</P>
<P>
 While acknowledging that there is nothing legally wrong with Thompson 
representing the two supervisor candidates, Nava said his involvement in their 
campaigns raised some ethical issues. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a little shady," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if Taconic is granted an appeal, it is too late for the landfill 
initiative to make the November ballot. But Jevens said a new petition drive 
would be launched early next year. 
</P>
<P>
 If Taconic fails to win an appeal, he said the new board of supervisors will 
have to decide whether to open a landfill at Weldon Canyon. He said he believes 
the county, which is facing the closure of Bailard Landfill in Oxnard in 1997, 
has little choice. 
</P>
<P>
 "For all practical purposes, there's still no alternative," he said.

SITE FOR NEW VETERANS HOME ANGERS TRIBE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IRA E. STOLL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ventura city officials will lobby a state task force to place a veterans home 
in east Ventura -- a move that delighted local veterans but angered members of 
the Chumash tribe of Native Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 At Monday night's City Council meeting, World War II veteran Semu Huate, who 
said he was a Chumash elder, made an impassioned plea to keep the veterans home 
off a site he said was a tribal burial ground. 
</P>
<P>
 "I say that you should not disturb anymore the bones of my people," Huate 
said. He warned that a decision to build on the land at Telephone Road near 
Saticoy Avenue would activate a curse that would cause three City Council 
members to die within a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Another Chumash, Richard Angulo of Thousand Oaks, said Tuesday that he would 
object to any building within 100 yards of a burial ground. 
</P>
<P>
 After questions from concerned council members unaware of the Chumash remains, 
Director of Community Services Everett Millais acknowledged that an 
environmental impact report had shown "substantial Indian remains" in the 
center of the property. 
</P>
<P>
 Millais said the veterans home is planned for only a 22-acre portion of the 
62-acre site owned by Wittenberg-Livingston Inc. The company plans to develop 
housing on the rest of the site but leave the burial ground area as open space, 
Millais said. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus reassured, the council unanimously endorsed the east Ventura location 
over a rival site on Olivas Park Drive, which is designated for agricultural 
use. Councilman Gary Tuttle was absent. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Stephen Bennett said putting the 400-bed facility on land 
designated for farming would probably spark community opposition. 
</P>
<P>
 "You'd have a political firestorm on your hands trying to move into the 
greenbelt," Bennett said. 
</P>
<P>
 Advocates of the Olivas Park site said presenting the state task force with 
two viable sites would double the city's chances of getting one approved. But 
council members and city staff said the best way to win state approval would be 
to present a united front. 
</P>
<P>
 Winning approval of a site -- any local site -- is most important to area 
veterans. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have at least 65,000 veterans in Ventura County," said Roy Chambers, a 
World War II veteran and commander of the Oxnard Post 11425 of the Veterans of 
Foreign Wars. "I know that some of those people who are homeless and are ill 
need someplace to turn to." 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Tom Buford will press the city's case before the Governor's Task Force 
on the Southern California Veterans Homes at the group's meeting in Anaheim on 
Oct. 27. By the end of the year, the task force will recommend three sites to 
the governor from among the approximately half-dozen in contention. 
</P>
<P>
 Wittenberg-Livingston has agreed to donate the 22 acres in return for the city 
agreeing to negotiate development rights on the rest of the site.

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; VANDALS FLATTEN TIRES ON 29 CARS, PICKUPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG RIPPEE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Spoiling the morning for car owners in Oxnard, one or more nighttime vandals 
using an ice pick or similar tool flattened the tires of 29 vehicles early 
Tuesday, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The tire companies will be eating steak tonight," Oxnard Police Officer Jason 
Benites said of the mischief along a quarter-mile stretch of Isle Way east of 
Victoria Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who knows? They might be suspects," he joked. 
</P>
<P>
 Between 2 a.m. and sunrise, someone punctured the tires of the cars and pickup 
trucks parked along five blocks of Isle Way, starting in the 2900 block, 
Benites said. The tires of a vehicle on adjoining Adelaide Court were also 
punctured. 
</P>
<P>
 In a single block, flats were discovered on 14 cars parked in front of an 
apartment and condominium complex. 
</P>
<P>
 On most of the vehicles, all four tires were punctured repeatedly and might 
have to be replaced instead of repaired, Benites said. He estimated the total 
damage at $20,000. 
</P>
<P>
 All types of cars -- young and old, domestic and foreign, expensive and 
economical -- were targeted, he added. He said the leaks were so slow on some 
tires that they were still hissing when police arrived. 
</P>
<P>
 Not so slow was the response of tow trucks, Benites said. As many as four were 
there at a time. 
</P>
<P>
 Even a pickup truck with a compressor showed up, to inflate some of the cars' 
tires long enough so that they could be driven to a shop for repairs, Benites 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people didn't even realize their tires were flat until they began to 
drive away," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He added that police had not identified any suspects. GREG RIPPEE

STREET BEAT: THE FIGHT AGAINST CRIME: NOTES FROM THE FRONT; DETECTIVE BUSY 
SEARCHING FOR L.A'S MISSING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHIP JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Missing Persons Unit of the Los Angeles Police Department was called into 
action last week when a man, away from his family on business, panicked when he 
called home and no one answered. 
</P>
<P>
 A complicating factor: The caller was a Christian minister who did missionary 
work in the Middle East, where religious differences can lead to violence. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a concern," said Detective Alex Valadez, who is assigned to track 
down missing persons from five San Fernando Valley police divisions. 
</P>
<P>
 It turned out the case was not the Tom Clancy sequel that it sounded like, but 
an impulsive decision by the "missing" wife to go camping. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a false alarm, but in the missing persons business that's a happy 
ending -- much happier than starting a homicide investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 In between these extreme outcomes, there are about 4,000 cases a year for the 
city's eight missing persons detectives and a million and one answers to the 
question: "They're gone -- what happened to them?" 
</P>
<P>
 "There are missing persons who don't want their family to know where they 
are," Valadez said. "In a lot of cultures, parents hold the traditional belief 
that adult children are their responsibility until they are married." 
</P>
<P>
 When those people are contacted, they usually give the police an earful of 
remarks like, "Hey, I'm a big boy," or "I want to be left alone," or "Don't 
give them my number," Valadez said. In other instances, people are harming 
themselves, but police are powerless to intervene. 
</P>
<P>
 In one case, an elderly Louisiana man who came to live with relatives in 
California to quit his heavy drinking decided he wasn't ready to sober up, 
after all. Valadez found him safe, sound and smashed at an automated teller 
machine on Skid Row. 
</P>
<P>
 Valadez said that for better or worse, Los Angeles is filled with "missing 
persons" who just don't want to go home, people who find peace in the anonymity 
of the gritty streets, blending into the cityscape of the homeless and the 
transient. 
</P>
<P>
 But in addition to all those who do not want to be found or who are not really 
missing, there are those who have lost their way or fallen victim to predators 
and who may never be seen or heard from again. 
</P>
<P>
 Cecilia Newball, 31, and John Ward, both of Chatsworth, are two of those 
people, Valadez suspects. 
</P>
<P>
 Newball, 31, who was 8 1/2 months pregnant with her second child, disappeared 
Sept. 20 from her apartment with her 6-year-old son, leaving a goodby note to 
her husband in her car. 
</P>
<P>
 A week later, a letter arrived, ostensibly from Newball, telling her husband 
that she had run off to Honduras with a man. 
</P>
<P>
 Valadez suspects the worst. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Newball case is a puzzling one because everything that has happened is 
out of the ordinary," Valadez explained. The handwriting on the note doesn't 
look like hers, he said, and "there are things about it that don't match her 
personality or habits, things that have been done that people say she would 
never do." 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything that has happened so far seems like it's someone trying to throw 
us off the track." 
</P>
<P>
 And then there is John Ward, who suffers from Alzheimer's disease, a nightmare 
come true for a missing persons detective. 
</P>
<P>
 Ward, 68, is an indefatigable hiker who can cover 25 miles a day according to 
his wife, Simone, who has scoured the Valley by helicopter and searched with a 
dog for her missing husband. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Ward left his home Aug. 31 over his wife's objections, wearing his 
sturdy hiking boots, he has been seen at least twice. 
</P>
<P>
 But by the time Valadez heard of a sighting, Ward had hoofed it miles away. He 
was seen Sept. 25 outside a natural foods store in Canoga Park by a woman who 
knew him but did not realize at the time that he was lost. 
</P>
<P>
 As worried as Ward's family is about his disappearance, Valadez considers the 
sightings a positive sign because it means the elderly man is still alive and 
strong. "If those reports are true, it means that he is still walking around 
out there somewhere," Valadez said. 
</P>
<P>
 For a tracer of missing persons, that's a hope and a challenge.

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: PORT HUENEME; FOR UNUSUAL COLLECTIONS, TRY TINY 
MUSEUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRISTINA LIMA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For Elaine K. Garber, it is the 3,000-piece collection of salt and pepper 
shakers that makes Port Hueneme Historical Museum so attractive. 
</P>
<P>
 The museum has shakers in the shape of cigarette packages and cereal boxes, 
shakers with the image of Elvis and John F. Kennedy, shakers that look like 
tiny Coke bottles or golf clubs. 
</P>
<P>
 "This collection tells us a lot about the cultural history of the American 
society," Garber said as she held a set of shakers showing Kennedy in a rocking 
chair. 
</P>
<P>
 "But then, for some other people, they may be fascinated by our barbed-wire 
collection," Garber added as she gazed on wires that date from as early as 
1891. 
</P>
<P>
 Garber, an avid Port Hueneme historian, is one of five volunteers who work 
part time to maintain the tiny museum at Market Street and Hueneme Road. 
</P>
<P>
 The museum not only boasts the collection of salt and pepper shakers, but also 
offers a range of black-and-white photographs and historic memorabilia. There 
are shots of the old pier, which was replaced with port renovations in 1940, 
and dining china from one of the city's first developers, Thomas R. Bard. 
</P>
<P>
 The museum, which was founded in 1976, is administered by the Port Hueneme 
Chamber of Commerce and shares the same historic building. 
</P>
<P>
 Surrounded by Monterey cypress trees, the building was constructed in 1925 and 
declared a Ventura County landmark in 1976. An original anchor and bell of a 
World War II ship sit outside. 
</P>
<P>
 The building was initially the headquarters of the Bank of Hueneme and later 
used as City Hall. In 1973, the city built the Civic Center and moved out. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm delighted that the city did not get rid of the building," Garber said. 
"We have so little (of historic value) in Port Hueneme that keeping the museum 
makes a big difference." 
</P>
<P>
 Garber, who sometimes gives tours of the exhibits, said the museum usually has 
from five to 20 visitors a day. "It's not a lot of people," she said, "but it's 
enough to keep our history alive." 
</P>
<P>
 A Port Hueneme resident for 38 years, Garber said she wished that the city had 
money to expand the museum so more items could be displayed. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a lot of things in storage and, once in a while, we change things 
around," she said. CHRISTINA LIMA

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: CAMARILLO; COUNCIL TO CONSIDER SANTA ROSA ROAD PACT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By J.E. MITCHELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Concerned that a stretch of Santa Rosa Road in Camarillo is too dangerous for 
motorists, the City Council tonight will consider hiring a local engineering 
company to tell the city how to make the road safer. 
</P>
<P>
 The council will consider awarding M3 Civil Consulting Engineers a $19,890 
contract to offer suggestions for improving a curvy section at the 7300 block 
of Santa Rosa Road. 
</P>
<P>
 A 1993 study of the road found that it had the fourth-highest accident rate of 
all roads in the city.  
</P>
<P>
 The report listed 21 accidents, two involving fatal injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said the road modification project could cost as much as $500,000. 
The council will consider the item at its meeting at 5 p.m. at City Hall, 601 
Carmen Drive. J.E. MITCHELL

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OJAI; DONATION INCREASES HOURS AT 3 LIBRARIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ventura County officials Tuesday welcomed a donation of more than $11,000 from 
the Ojai Valley Friends of the Library to extend the hours of operation at 
three area branches. 
</P>
<P>
 The approval of the donation included an agreement with the city of Ojai that 
spells out the terms of a city contribution of more than $25,000 to keep the 
libraries open longer than the county could otherwise afford. 
</P>
<P>
 "These funds will allow the Oak View, Meiners Oak and Ojai libraries to be 
open a few more hours a week," county Library Services Agency Director Dixie 
Adeniran told supervisors Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the agreement, the Ojai library will be open 40 hours a week, while the 
two smaller branches will increase their hours from 16 to 19 each week through 
June, 1995. JEFF McDONALD

 The Ventura City Council is in favor of good relations with the public but 
against spending $100,000 over two years to improve them, members said. 
</P>
<P>
 At Monday night's meeting, council members rejected a staff proposal to hire a 
$33,000-a-year public relations coordinator to distribute press releases and 
train city staff in working with the media. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal included additional expenses for administrative costs and 
printing informational pamphlets for residents. 
</P>
<P>
 The vote was 6 to 0, with Councilman Gary Tuttle absent. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members voiced concern about the cost of adding the proposed employee 
to the payroll. They also said they hoped that the new city manager they are 
searching for would spearhead efforts to improve the city's public image. 
</P>
<P>
 "This would be one of the first problems that we would like to see a new city 
manager tackle," Councilman Jack Tingstrom said. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members took pains to clarify that they were not opposed to the idea 
of citizen awareness, only the cost. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought there were a number of excellent ideas in there," Mayor Tom Buford 
said. "I certainly think that we want to go as far as we can in terms of 
existing resources." IRA E. STOLL

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: FILLMORE; WOMAN INJURED IN THEFT OF PURSE

 A 70-year-old Fillmore woman suffered minor injuries Tuesday after struggling 
with a mugger who yanked her purse from her grip and fled on foot from the 
Buenaventura Mall parking lot, Ventura police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The thief, who shed some of his clothing as he fled, ran up to Margaret A. 
Meyer as she and her friend, Margaret Meadows, 71, of Fillmore, were getting 
into Meyer's car about 2:10 p.m. in the south parking lot of the mall on South 
Mills Road, Officer Phil Steinberger said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meyer, whose purse was draped over her right shoulder, "wasn't going to let it 
go, not at all," Steinberger said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the man, whom Steinberger described as poorly groomed, about 6 feet tall 
and 145 pounds, pulled the purse from Meyer's hands with such force that its 
strap broke and she fell to the asphalt beside her 1985 Grand Marquis. 
</P>
<P>
 She declined to have police call paramedics, however, and was treated instead 
by a mall employee for scrapes and bruises on her right knee and both arms, 
Steinberger said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dodging traffic as he fled on Main Street, the man removed his faded green 
shirt and black baseball cap and bundled them up with the purse, Steinberger 
said. He ran west on Porter Lane before disappearing through a back yard. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to about $200 in cash, the purse contained a checkbook and credit 
cards, Steinberger said. He said Meyer had left the mall through the doors near 
the food court. 
</P>
<P>
 The robber was described as a white man in his mid-20s with shoulder-length 
light brown hair. He was wearing checkered shorts and white tennis shoes, 
according to witness accounts to police. GREG RIPPEE

 Garbage generated in western Ventura County would be disposed of by a new 
government agency, according to a plan approved by the Ventura City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 The council agreed Monday to form the West County Waste Management 
Authority.Under the plan, the agency will decide what to do with the city's 
trash after the 1996 closure of the western county's only dump, the Bailard 
Landfill. 
</P>
<P>
 Ojai is expected to join Ventura in the new authority, which is subject to 
approval by the County Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 By combining the waste of at least two cities, the authority would be able to 
obtain better prices on space in landfills outside the county, said Curtis 
Updike, an aide to Supervisor Maggie Kildee. 
</P>
<P>
 "The more waste you can generate, the better price you can get," Updike said. 
"It's very important that Ventura take this step." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said contracting to send the trash outside the county should also 
eliminate the need for building a controversial landfill in Weldon Canyon, 
situated between Ventura and Ojai. IRA E. STOLL

 A carload of suspected gang members chased three Simi Valley high school 
youths in another vehicle and fired a handgun at them, striking their car, Simi 
Valley police said Tuesday. The students, a 17-year-old and two 16-year-olds, 
were approaching Erringer Road from eastbound Patricia Avenue about 3 a.m. 
Sunday when the confrontation occurred, Lt. Tony Harper said. 
</P>
<P>
 The other car, a small, dark-colored vehicle, pulled alongside and several 
occupants flashed gang signs at the students, who are not involved with gangs, 
Harper said. 
</P>
<P>
 To avoid conflict, the students drove away but were followed by the other car, 
from which someone subsequently fired a handgun, Harper said. The students' car 
was struck once. 
</P>
<P>
 The students, who did not report the incident until Tuesday, attend Simi 
Valley High School, Royal High and the Simi Valley Adult School, he said. GREG

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: VACCINATION CLINICS AIM TO COMBAT FLU 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By J.E. MITCHELL

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Seeking to blunt the impact of the annual onset of the flu season -- 
especially to senior citizens -- private and public health officials are 
offering free vaccination clinics across Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Randy Feldman, the county's health officer, said the annual shots are 
important for senior citizens who are more likely than other people to become 
seriously ill if they contract a flu virus. 
</P>
<P>
 "With aging, disease-fighting ability slows down and you don't snap back after 
a couple days of flu like you did when you were younger," Feldman said. 
"Without a flu shot, a serious case of flu can develop quickly and worsen 
rapidly." 
</P>
<P>
 FHP Health Care and St. John's Regional Medical Center will offer free flu 
vaccinations Thursday at Our Lady of Guadalupe Church, 500 N. Juanita Ave., in 
Oxnard, according to FHP spokesman Bobby Pena. 
</P>
<P>
 Other dates and locations are Monday at the Wilson Senior Center, 350 N. C 
St., Oxnard; Tuesday at the offices of the Ventura County Council on Aging, 
4917 S. Rose Ave., Oxnard; and Oct. 26 at the offices of the Camarillo Health 
Care District, 3639 E. Las Posas Road, Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
 The clinics, open to all ages, will run from 9 a.m. to noon. For more 
information, call (818) 779-2199. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Feldman said, Ventura County public health officials will offer a 
series of free flu vaccination clinics for those over 60 and others who have 
chronic medical problems that would be complicated by the flu. 
</P>
<P>
 The clinics will be offered in Port Hueneme, Camarillo, Ventura, Santa Paula, 
Ojai, Thousand Oaks, Simi Valley, Oxnard, Moorpark and Fillmore starting next 
month. 
</P>
<P>
 For times and locations of those clinics, call the county public health 
department at (805) 652-5918 or (805) 385-8652. J.E. MITCHELL

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; PSYCHOLOGIST TESTIFIES FOR DEFENSE IN 
SLAYING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Thousand Oaks teen-ager who fatally shot his girlfriend while playing with a 
loaded gun "has a quick fuse" and lacks common sense, a defense psychologist 
testified Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 But clinical neuropsychologist Harold L. Burke denied that the 17-year-old 
defendant has a criminal nature and suggested that he did not understand the 
consequences of pointing a gun at the victim. 
</P>
<P>
 The defendant suffers from a severe attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, 
Burke said. The affliction is marked by poor judgment and inattention, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The boy covers up for his lack of general understanding by being tough, said 
Burke, the final major witness in the Ventura County juvenile trial. "He has 
some tendencies to be insensitive. That's part of his hard-boiled facade." 
</P>
<P>
 The youth is charged with seven criminal counts, including murder, in the July 
12 death of 16-year-old Jacqueline Reay. The defendant was aiming the gun at 
Reay and squeezing the trigger when a bullet discharged and struck her in the 
eye, according to court testimony. He said he did not know there was a bullet 
in the firing chamber. 
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court Judge Charles W. Campbell Jr. could issue a verdict today after 
attorneys' final arguments. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Donald C. Glynn wants the youth convicted of second-degree 
murder, contending he should have known not to point a loaded gun at the 
victim. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorney Victor Furio, however, called Burke to the stand in hopes of 
convincing the judge that the youth lacked the mental capacity to appreciate 
the danger of his act. 
</P>
<P>
 Burke concluded that the boy "has less common sense and social judgment than 
95% of other 17-year-olds." 
</P>
<P>
 He also has low self-esteem and covers up for that "by trying to act macho," 
Burke said. DWAYNE BRAY

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: MOORPARK; BOARD DELAYS PACT ON NEW HEALTH CLINIC 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A decision on a $306,000 agreement to operate a health clinic in Moorpark has 
been put off for a week by the County Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 County Counsel James L. McBride told supervisors Tuesday that minor work 
needed to be done on the specific language of the agreement, which would 
appoint a Ventura County Medical Center physician to run the hospital's 
satellite clinic. 
</P>
<P>
 The county agreed earlier this year to build a clinic of about 2,000 square 
feet on Princeton Avenue in Moorpark, replacing a center that was closed last 
year due to structural problems. 
</P>
<P>
 But Supervisor Vicky Howard questioned the delay. 
</P>
<P>
 "This clinic has been closed almost a year now," she said. "I'd like to see it 
opened before the end of the year." 
</P>
<P>
 Hospital Administrator Pierre Durand told board members that construction on 
the new facility had already begun. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're working very hard to meet that commitment" of opening before 1995, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The clinic averaged about 50 patients a week when it was closed last year, 
said Dr. Richard Ashby, who will oversee the new medical office. JEFF McDONALD

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: COUNTY COMMUTERS FARE WELL IN STUDY 
</P>

<P>
 Ventura County commuters drive the shortest distances, feel the least stress 
and are more satisfied with their daily drive than other Southern California 
commuters, according to a survey released this week. 
</P>
<P>
 As in past years, the sixth annual State of the Commute Report, produced by 
Commuter Transportation Services Inc., also found that Ventura County commuters 
spend less time on the road than their counterparts in Los Angeles, Orange, San 
Bernardino and Riverside counties. 
</P>
<P>
 On average, Ventura County commuters spent about 59 minutes driving to and 
from work each day, 20 minutes less than Riverside commuters and five minutes 
less than commuters living in Los Angeles, according to the agency survey. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles-based agency, also known as Commuter Computer, is the oldest 
and largest in the country providing information on ride-sharing and commuting. 
</P>
<P>
 The survey was based on a telephone poll of 2,625 residents, 525 in each of 
the five counties. The agency cautioned that residents were surveyed late last 
year, prior to the Jan. 17 earthquake, which may have altered commuting habits. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the survey's findings: 
</P>
<P>
 * About 82% of Ventura County commuters drive alone to and from work, putting 
them in the middle among the five counties. 
</P>
<P>
 * On a scale of 1 to 9, with 9 being best, Ventura County commuters rated 
their overall driving satisfaction at 6.9, the highest in the five-county 
region. 
</P>
<P>
 * About 13% of Ventura County commuters said they were bothered by traffic 
"very often," compared to 24% in Orange County and 18% in Riverside County.

THOUSAND OAKS PANEL REJECTS PROPOSAL FOR HOUSING NEAR WETLAND; NEWBURY PARK: 
PLANNERS' INITIAL VOTE ESSENTIALLY WOULD HAVE KILLED THE DEVELOPMENT BUT A 
LATER REVERSAL SENDS IT TO THE COUNCIL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 After a contentious nine-hour hearing marked by a 3 a.m. flip-flop, frazzled 
Thousand Oaks planning commissioners on Tuesday rejected a developer's plan to 
build 87 houses next to a Newbury Park wetland. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the apparent victory for Newbury Park residents who have fought the 
Raznick & Sons development plan for nearly a decade, the commission's early 
morning reversal of a crucial vote saved the project from collapse. 
</P>
<P>
 Initially, commissioners said they found numerous inadequacies in the 
project's environmental study and voted 4 to 1 to require more analysis to 
ensure residents' safety from calamities such as floods and earthquakes. 
</P>
<P>
 But when staff members told the board that rejection of the environmental 
report would delay a final City Council ruling for months and essentially kill 
the project, Commissioners Forrest Frields and Irving Wasserman asked for 
another vote, which led to the reversal. 
</P>
<P>
 Commissioners then voted against the project, a decision that was 
automatically appealed to the council and scheduled for a hearing next week. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents who stayed long enough to witness the 3 a.m. reversal stormed out of 
the meeting and called the process "a sham."  
</P>
<P>
 "I think it was totally inappropriate," Newbury Park resident Ricki Mikkelsen 
said. "They said there needed to be more study on the safety issues, and we 
agreed. Now it won't get done." 
</P>
<P>
 After the meeting, Frields and Wasserman, who joined Commissioner Mervyn Kopp 
in finally approving the environmental review, defended their decision. 
</P>
<P>
 They said the City Council directed them to make a decision and send the 
project to the council for a final vote next week.  
</P>
<P>
 "We had to make a decision on this," Wasserman said. "We had to follow the 
council's directive." 
</P>
<P>
 Raznick spokeswoman Ellen Michiel said only quick approval would keep the 
Woodland Hills-based developer from pursuing a lawsuit filed against the city 
after the council rejected the project a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Planning Commissioner Linda Parks called the reversal a betrayal of the 
board's duties under state law. She said the developer's request to move 
quickly should not override questions on safety. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are defeating the purpose of this commission if we vote based on 
scheduling," Parks said. "To ignore the problems that we all agreed existed 
just to push the project forward is wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 Michiel said she was pleased with the outcome despite the commission's 
recommendation against the project. 
</P>
<P>
 "All we wanted was to get to the council," she said. The environmental and 
safety concerns raised during the hearing have all been thoroughly examined, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raznick development, planned for 44 acres near Reino Road and Knollwood 
Drive, was rejected by the city last October because lot sizes were too small. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members said they feared that small lots would encourage residents to 
wander onto the sensitive wetland nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 Raznick sued the city, claiming procedural errors, but agreed not to press the 
issue until making a final attempt to gain city approval, Michiel said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the proposal debated into Tuesday morning, Raznick lopped off nine lots, 
increasing the size of the 87 remaining lots by an average of 900 square feet. 
</P>
<P>
 Commissioners Frields, Wasserman, Parks and Marilyn Carpenter all said the 
proposed 6,800-square-foot lots needed to be closer in size to existing 7,000- 
and 8,000-square-foot pads where neighbors live. 
</P>
<P>
 But before discussing lot size, commissioners spent hours considering a wide 
scope of issues including seismic safety, the threat of flooding and 
liquefaction, parking, and concern for oak trees and wetlands. 
</P>
<P>
 Commissioners could not agree on several issues, including the potential of 
earthquake damage for houses built on imported dirt fill and conflicting 
reports on the potential for liquefaction. 
</P>
<P>
 Kopp blasted the commissioners for raising issues that he considered beyond 
the scope of any reasonable discussion.

400 AT CAMARILLO FORUM PROTEST SPRAYING; MEDFLY: CROWD CRITICIZES PANEL OF 
STATE AND COUNTY OFFICIALS OVER PLAN TO USE MALATHION TO ERADICATE PEST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By J.E. MITCHELL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A crowd of about 400 people packed an eastern Camarillo school gymnasium 
Tuesday night to protest the aerial spraying of malathion that state officials 
will start tonight to halt a Medfly infestation. 
</P>
<P>
 The meeting -- the first event where all Camarillo residents could share their 
views -- measured the outrage of many residents who oppose the spraying plan to 
eradicate the crop-munching pest that threatens Ventura County's $800-million 
agriculture industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Meeting at the Las Colinas School gymnasium, the crowd criticized the panel of 
state and county officials who answered questions about the spraying plan that 
will cover 16 square miles. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think that they care whether or not this presents a health risk to 
us," said Beth Fraley, who paraded through the room in handcuffs, a gag in her 
mouth and a small sign that read "Chem Ag Gag." 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe that malathion is a danger to the public's health and its spraying 
should be stopped," Fraley said. "It's not worth it." 
</P>
<P>
 But Ventura County Public Health Officer Dr. Gary Feldman said that while he 
did not like the idea of aerial spraying, he said the heavily diluted chemical 
presented no danger to human beings or pets. 
</P>
<P>
 "So far as can be possibly known, the health risks are minimal," Feldman said. 
"I do support the decision to spray given the economic consequences before us." 
</P>
<P>
 Feldman and other officials urged the audience to take common sense 
precautions during the spraying operations: stay indoors; keep pets indoors or 
sheltered; wash off surfaces exposed to the chemical; wash off fruit before 
eating it; and keep cars covered or in garages. 
</P>
<P>
 But others at the meeting -- waving signs that read -- "Dehumanization Is a 
Crime -- We Are Not Insects!" -- pleaded with officials to consider 
alternatives to the low-flying, helicopter-spraying operations. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why did the people at Leisure Village try to get an exemption from the 
spraying if this isn't a health risk?" asked anti-spraying activist Leonard 
Mehlmauer. "Why does the tone of this panel before you sound apologetic?" 
</P>
<P>
 Camarillo resident Bonnar Quint said that he too supported the eradication of 
Mediterranean fruit flies, but not necessarily through the use of malathion. He 
called for using sterile Medflies to stop the pest. Panelists, including 
officials from the state Department of Food and Agriculture, responded that 
growers of the sterile flies could not produce enough of them in time to thwart 
the infestation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm against the Medfly, but the spin I've heard tonight does not convince me 
this is the right approach," Quint said. 
</P>
<P>
 While those who opposed the spraying operation far outnumbered those in favor, 
some audience members said eradicating the pests was necessary, if unpleasant. 
</P>
<P>
 "I look at it as a necessary evil," said Virginia Hoover, a mother of two 
small children and a Camarillo homeowner who lives in the spray zone. "We have 
to act and at this point I am willing to trust what the government is saying." 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Nunez, 36, an avocado packing house employee and Camarillo resident, 
agreed with Hoover. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have worked in the farming business all of my life and I can tell you that 
if we don't act to get rid of this fly, the whole county is going to be in 
trouble," Nunez said. "I have two kids and I know this stuff won't hurt them."

 Ventura County sheriff's deputies were investigating the hit-and-run accident, 
which occurred about 6:50 p.m. Sheriff's Lt. Gary Cook said the car had been 
recovered, but the driver had fled the scene.

CREATIONISM IN COURT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The article "Teacher's Lawsuit Over Evolution Rejected" (Oct. 5) proves that 
far too many Americans are as scientifically illiterate as the world was in 
1859 when Charles Darwin proved that evolution was an observable historic 
reality. 
</P>
<P>
 I do hope that the voting public will notice that it is again the politically 
active Christian Coalition's American Center for Law and Justice that is going 
take this useless and wasteful lawsuit all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
 I am delighted to see the Christian Coalition leadership waste so much of 
their tax exempted dollars on this replay of the Scopes trial. The circus 
entertainment will be fun to watch. The Christian Coalition leaders will be 
very sad clowns when the Supreme Court rules that "creationism" is a religious 
pseudo-science and evolution is scientific fact. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, the fundamentalists will learn nothing from this decision and will 
file another suit next year, and so on forever. 
</P>
<P>
 I also hope the voting public will notice that the Christian Coalition is 
still trying to legally force the teaching of creationism.  
</P>
<P>
 This must be stopped right now before we have an old-thinking state church 
forced on all of us.

LESSONS OF BIGOTRY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Deborah Hotaling is correct in her assumption that there is no such thing as 
an "easy" discussion on matters related to race, sex or homophobia ("Lessons 
Have to Be Learned Face to Face" Sept 19). 
</P>
<P>
 There is no nice or comfortable way to confront our often unexamined bigoted 
beliefs or assumptions. However, we can shed these beliefs through a process of 
self-examination and public dialogue. 
</P>
<P>
 Covering over the ugliness and hatred behind any form of bigotry with silence 
or "politically correct" rhetoric does nothing to move us any closer to a 
solution. Unlearning the lessons of bigotry can be no more painful and 
uncomfortable than living amid the fear and hatred it inspires.

CAL STATE FULLERTON NOTEBOOK / LON EUBANKS: HAWKING READY FOR HIS NEW START 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LON EUBANKS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Cal State Fullerton men's basketball team will start practice this 
weekend, and Coach Bob Hawking is calling it "a new beginning" for all the 
players. 
</P>
<P>
 Hawking, named interim coach after Brad Holland's move to the University of 
San Diego, says he has no preconceived notions about a starting lineup. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every spot on the team is wide open, and I really mean that," Hawking said. 
"That's the easy part of our job as coaches because the players will determine 
that themselves in practice. We'll keep a close eye on how the players are 
competing and how hard they're working. I really believe in working hard in 
practice. I want our players to come away from every practice a little bit 
better." 
</P>
<P>
 Hawking said there will be some minor changes from the way Holland did things, 
but nothing major. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll be doing a few different things from an X and O standpoint, both 
offensively and defensively, but nothing that drastic," Hawking said. "Most of 
these players have extensive basketball backgrounds, and I don't think they'll 
be seeing much that they haven't been exposed to before." 
</P>
<P>
 Winston Peterson, who averaged 15.3 points as a junior, is the top returning 
player from a team that was 8-19 and 6-12 in the Big West Conference. Senior 
guard James French started all 27 games last season and averaged 9.3 points, 
and junior center David Frigout started 18 games and averaged 5.3 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Several newcomers could play key roles this season. That group includes three 
community college transfers: forward David Harrison of Mt. Hood (Wash.) 
College, guard Ali Nayab of Southwestern College in San Diego and guard Chuck 
Overton of Salt Lake College. 
</P>
<P>
 Hawking has been pleased with the team's effort in preseason conditioning. 
"We'll put a real emphasis on that in this program," Hawking said. "There are 
so many games that are won in the last two minutes that it has to be a 
priority." 
</P>
<P>
 The men's team will be part of a "Midnight Madness" promotion, along with the 
women's team, Friday night at Titan Gym, then they'll get down to serious 
business in their first regular workout Saturday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton soccer Coach Al Mistri says there's no question about it. "We need 
to go 2-0 this weekend . . . end of discussion," Mistri said. 
</P>
<P>
 The men's team split two Mountain Pacific Soccer Federation games last 
weekend, losing to UC Santa Barbara, 3-2, and beating Cal State Northridge, 
1-0. That makes it even more important for the Titans to do well in home games 
Friday against Nevada Las Vegas and Sunday against New Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're still very much alive in our division," Mistri said. "UC Santa Barbara 
is 2-0, but everyone else has lost at least one game. And this weekend we'll be 
at home. It will be great just not having to travel." 
</P>
<P>
 Mistri feels the victory over Northridge could be pivotal. "It was one we 
really felt we had to win after losing to Santa Barbara," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The loss to UC Santa Barbara was disappointing to Mistri because the Titans 
were ahead, 2-0, with little more than a minute to play in the first half. At 
that point, Titan goalkeeper Mike Kornock had a goal kick opportunity, but 
decided instead to try a pass to Ricky Rodriguez, instead of kicking it deep 
downfield. The pass was intercepted and UC Santa Barbara scored a goal before 
the half ended. Two second-half goals gave UC Santa Barbara the victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Kornock, however, played superbly against Northridge, including getting a key 
block on a penalty kick. 
</P>
<P>
 Mistri has been encouraged by Eddie Soto's strong play the last two games. 
Soto, the team's top returning player, had been slowed by illness and injuries 
earlier in the season. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Everything is moving along in high gear for the anniversary dinner and 
exhibition that will celebrate 20 years of women's gymnastics at Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 The event is Nov. 2 beginning at 6 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 "It started as an idea for something fairly small, but it really has grown 
fairly large," Coach Lynn Rogers said. "We've had a good response from both on 
the campus and off. One of the toughest jobs is converting our practice room 
into a banquet facility, but we think everything will be fine." In addition to 
the awards dinner, there will be a gymnastics exhibition. 
</P>
<P>
 Former university President Don Shields has indicated he will attend, as have 
former Athletic Director Neal Stoner and former associate director Leanne 
Grotke. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the former gymnasts planning to attend include All-American Tammi 
Elliott, who also was a Miss America contestant. She will be coming from 
Virginia. The school's first All-American in the sport, Karilyn Burdick, who 
lives in Palo Alto, also is scheduled to attend. 
</P>
<P>
 "There have been a lot of great people go through our program, and many of 
them will be coming back for this night," Rogers said. "We're really pleased 
that so many of them can be involved." Titan Notes 
</P>
<P>
 The fourth Faculty-Staff tennis tournament, which raises money for the 
Fullerton women's tennis team, will be Nov. 4. . . . Titan assistant softball 
coach Michelle Gromacki participated in the dedication of the Olympic softball 
field in Atlanta on Monday. Gromacki, a catcher, is expected to be selected to 
the Olympic team.

 San Clemente, ranked No. 1 in Southern Section Division I, jumped to a 
six-goal halftime lead, then got several key saves from Gabe Gardner to beat 
No. 2 Long Beach Wilson, 10-6, in a nonleague water polo match Tuesday at 
Saddleback College. 
</P>
<P>
 Gardner, who finished with 20 saves, found himself in several one-on-one 
situations with Wilson's Pat Cochran, considered one of the top players in the 
state.Their most crucial confrontation occurred with 1 minute 40 seconds left 
to play, and Wilson trailing, 9-6. 
</P>
<P>
 Cochran stole the ball at mid-pool and drove in on Gardner. Cochran tried to 
loft the ball over Gardner's head, but Gardner extended his 6-foot-9 frame to 
palm the ball. 
</P>
<P>
 Colin Shaughnessy and Jimmy Farley scored two goals each as San Clemente 
(13-1) led, 6-1, after one quarter. The Tritons led, 7-1, at halftime, and, 
8-4, entering the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 A goal by Cochran with 5:56 remaining pulled Wilson (10-2) to within 8-6 with 
5:56 left, but Shaughnessy scored two minutes later, and capped the scoring 
with a goal with one second left. His four goals led the Tritons.

 The two teams could meet again this weekend at the Southern California

PASEANA TO HAVE THROAT SURGERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL CHRISTINE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A throat problem will prevent Paseana from running in Sunday's $300,000 
Spinster Stakes at Keeneland and will also keep the 7-year-old mare out of the 
Breeders' Cup Distaff at Churchill Downs on Nov. 5. 
</P>
<P>
 Paseana will undergo surgery to relieve an entrapped epiglottis that will take 
her out of training for 10 days.Alysheba had a similar operation in 1987, then 
won the Kentucky Derby about two months later. 
</P>
<P>
 Trainer Ron McAnally said that it is possible Paseana will continue to race 
next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Paseana has earned $2.9 million. The retired Dance Smartly leads female horses 
with $3.2 million. Paseana won the Breeders' Cup Distaff in 1992, was second to 
Hollywood Wildcat in the race last year and was voted the Eclipse Award for 
best older female both years. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, the Argentine-bred has two victories and a second in three starts, 
having won the Chula Vista Handicap at Del Mar in her last race. Paseana won 
the Spinster last year and finished second in the race the year before. Each 
year Paseana has run in the Breeders' Cup, her owners, Sidney and Jenny Craig, 
have paid a $200,000 supplementary fee to make her eligible. 
</P>
<P>
 The Craigs probably will run Exchange in the Breeders' Cup Distaff. She 
finished second to Hollywood Wildcat at Santa Anita Monday in the Lady's Secret 
Handicap. BILL CHRISTINE

HARVARD-WESTLAKE PRESENTS OBSTACLES TOO BIG FOR LOUISVILLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL LAZARUS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The game plan for Louisville High in its girls' volleyball match against 
Harvard-Westlake on Tuesday night was simple. 
</P>
<P>
 Keep the ball away from Amanda Selby. 
</P>
<P>
 But Selby, the Wolverines' 6-foot-2 middle blocker, was too imposing an 
obstacle along the front line, and although the Royals forced Westlake to make 
difficult passes to Selby, her 19 kills and five blocks led the host Wolverines 
to a 15-0, 18-16, 15-11 victory in a Mission League match. 
</P>
<P>
 Only three of Selby's kills came in the lopsided first game, but she had help 
from outside hitters Carolyn Miller (four kills) and Lesley Coben (two kills). 
</P>
<P>
 How bad was the first game for Louisville? The Royals could accomplish only 
two sideouts and finished with one kill and one block, both by outside hitter 
Lauren Brownson. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we were probably a little over-excited," Brownson said. "Most of us 
have been playing them for three years and we were hoping this would be the 
time we could finally beat them." 
</P>
<P>
 Westlake (4-3, 3-0 in league play) wanted to show that last Friday's loss to 
Delphic League powerhouse Brentwood was a fluke. The Wolverines played well at 
the beginning of that match, but faltered and lost in four games. 
</P>
<P>
 The same scenario began to develop in the second game when Louisville (4-4, 
2-1) jumped out to a 4-0 lead. Westlake rallied behind Selby and setter Jenny 
Kriste to tie the score, 6-6. The teams traded the lead until three Selby kills 
erased a 16-15 deficit. 
</P>
<P>
 "We let up last week and we let up a little bit tonight too," Selby said. "We 
had to play well at get it back. We didn't against Brentwood but we did now." 
</P>
<P>
 Kriste, normally the starting setter, didn't play in Westlake's previous three 
matches after spraining both wrists in a match against Fountain Valley.  
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday, she came in for replacement Mandy Kaplan in the second game and again 
halfway through the third game, finishing with six blocks and 26 assists. 
Brownson and outside hitter Audra Duda had five kills each in the second game 
to keep Louisville close.

DIGEST: JACOBSEN OPTS FOR SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF FLETCHER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Crescenta Valley High shooting guard Brock Jacobsen said Tuesday he will sign 
a letter of intent to play basketball for former Falcon Brad Holland at the 
University of San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 Jacobsen, who averaged 21 points a game last year and led the Falcons to the 
Southern Section Division I-AA championship game, will sign Nov. 9, the first 
day of the NCAA early signing period. 
</P>
<P>
 He chose San Diego over Loyola Marymount and Pacific, where his brother, Adam, 
plays. Jacobsen said he decided that San Diego was the best fit for him because 
of his relationship with Holland, who became the Torero coach last month after 
Hank Egan took a job with the San Antonio Spurs. JEFF FLETCHER

SIDELINES; CRESPI DEEJAY EMERSON A REAL CROWD-PLEASER AT RECEPTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When Wayne Emerson isn't catching spirals, he's spinning discs. 
</P>
<P>
 For the past four years, the Crespi High wide receiver has been earning as 
much as $250 a day as a disc jockey for parties, weddings and dances. 
</P>
<P>
 "I started my own business in eighth grade," said Emerson, who is second in 
the region with 32 receptions. "I even have my own business card." 
</P>
<P>
 Emerson hauls his equipment in a family van. His collection of compact discs 
totals nearly 3,000. And if he doesn't have the desired music, he'll find it. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they want rap, I'll play rap," Emerson said. "The only thing I won't play 
is something with dirty language." 
</P>
<P>
 Alex or Trevino?: At Verdugo Hills High, you can't tell the football players 
without a program. Or with a program. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 43 names on the Dons' roster, 12 are misspelled. 
</P>
<P>
 Kicker Alex Trevino was omitted altogether. When a reporter on the sideline 
asked who the kicker was, a Verdugo Hills coach jotted Trevino's name at the 
bottom of the roster. 
</P>
<P>
 A later check revealed that, you guessed it, he misspelled it. 
</P>
<P>
 Sounds threatening: Grant High football Coach Bill Foster won't soon forget 
Van Nuys' final touchdown in a 52-25 victory over his team. 
</P>
<P>
 With 1 minute 59 seconds left, John McPherson scored from 57 yards on a fake 
punt. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we're in that situation, leading 45-25, we punt the football," Foster 
said. "We weren't too happy about that. But what goes around comes around." 
</P>
<P>
 Bookends: Cornerback Jim Rose tied a school single-game record with three 
interceptions in Cal State Northridge's 40-14 victory over Sonoma State last 
weekend. He has no illusions why. 
</P>
<P>
 Playing corner on the opposite side is senior Vinnie Johnson, a four-year 
starter. 
</P>
<P>
 "Teams should pick on me," said Rose, who was named the team's defensive 
player of the week. "Vinnie's a proven starter. If I was them, I'd probably 
throw it my way too." Quotebook  
</P>
<P>
 Royal High football Coach Gene Uebelhardt, whose team posted its second 
consecutive shutout, 35-0 over Newbury Park, gave the credit to defensive 
coordinator Don Reyes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know anything about defense," Uebelhardt said. "All I do is make sure 
they are on the bus." 
</P>
<P>
 Auto Club: Ventura High football Coach Phil McCune, whose team has a record of 
1-4 but, at 1-1, is very much in the Channel League race: "We're not in the 
driver's seat, but we're in the car." 
</P>
<P>
 Horror flick: Chaminade High defensive tackle Edward Youssoufan on the Eagles' 
72-14 loss to Bloomington: "When we had films the next day, we didn't have 
films. Coach (Rich Lawson) said, 'You guys don't need to see this.' " Stats  
</P>
<P>
 Quarterback Ruben Montoya's nine-yard run against Van Nuys High last Friday 
marked the first touchdown this season by a Grant player other than tailback 
Di-Onte Smith. Of Smith's 11 touchdown runs, six have been of 46 yards or more, 
and five have been 64 yards or longer. 
</P>
<P>
 Passing fancy: Quartz Hill High quarterback Brian Woodworth, a 
second-stringer, has completed six passes -- four for touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 Mr. Versatility: Highland High quarterback Jason Carr ran for a touchdown, 
passed for a touchdown and caught a touchdown pass -- accounting for all three 
of the Bulldogs' scores in a 21-13 victory over Tehachapi. 
</P>
<P>
 One-man gang: In five games, Santa Paula High has only four touchdowns -- all 
by running back Jeremy Johnson. Johnson, who also is the Cardinals' kicker, has 
scored 27 of his team's 29 points. The other two came on a safety. Honors  
</P>
<P>
 Pierce College quarterback David Muir and Moorpark running back Gary Clemons 
were selected offensive players of the week in the Western State Conference. 
Glendale linebacker Paul Lopez was the circuit's top defensive player. 
</P>
<P>
 Muir completed 17 of 28 passes for 214 yards and five touchdowns in Pierce's 
36-20 victory over West Los Angeles. Clemons rushed 26 times for 136 yards to 
lead Moorpark to a 23-20 upset of previously undefeated Bakersfield. Lopez made 
14 unassisted tackles and caused a fumble as Glendale downed Santa Monica, 
18-0. 
</P>
<P>
 Tackling machine: Cal Lutheran linebacker Lance Martin, a Thousand Oaks High 
graduate, was selected the Southern California Intercollegiate Athletic 
Conference's top defensive player of the week for his 20-tackle effort in a 
23-6 loss to La Verne.  
</P>
<P>
 Martin is the first player in the conference to record 20 tackles in a game. 
</P>
<P>
 Team awards: Running back Shaun Coleman was offensive player of the week for 
the Northridge football team, scoring three times and gaining a career-high 94 
yards in 10 carries as the Matadors routed Sonoma State. Jonas Walker was 
special-teams player of the week. Things to Do  
</P>
<P>
 Thursday, 3 p.m., at the Agoura High cross-country course. Agoura, Channel

 DOG DAYS FOR THE CAT: It's not dogs that have it bad at the pound, it's the 
poor cat. New figures show dogs at the county animal shelter are much more 
likely than cats to be adopted -- or redeemed by their owners. One problem: 
Owners seldom put tags on their cats. . . . But there's a new ID for cats that 
can be worn like an earring stud. Animal control director Judy Maitlen urges 
even a cat collar: "Cats don't think 'I gotta lose this thing around my neck.' 
Cats think, 'I should go take a nap.' "

 LESS POMP: The old Santa Margarita Water District board -- the one voters 
pretty much drove out when improprieties surfaced last year -- had planned on 
moving into a new, $12.5-million headquarters in Mission Viejo. Which presented 
a dilemma to the economy-conscious new board. . . . It studied perhaps even 
selling the newly completed building. But the final solution: The board soon 
will move its operations there, but sublease 10,000 square feet of the new 
building's space. . . . Says board President Jim Holmes: "The new board would 
have built a different building."

 THE OUT-OF-TOWNERS: The spacious Huntington Beach Library has a new plan for

60% of those fees go to buy new books. . . . Says library spokesman Ron Hayden: 
"We are only asking that non-residents help contribute to the support of the 
library at the same rate that residents contribute."

people wanted to say to him," he says. So far, a majority of the 100 letters 
support Simpson. 
</P>
<P>
 SUPER: The "Super Scooper" (above) was super-duper Tuesday. The firefighting 
planes, on a test run, scooped up 1,400 gallons of water apiece from Castaic 
Lake, and dropped them on a nearby hillside (B1, B7). . . . "The Super Scooper 
is not a panacea or guarantee that all fires will be kept small," said county 
Fire Chief P. Michael Freeman, "but it has a unique capacity to extinguish 
California's hellfires." 
</P>
<P>
 TRUANTS: Hockey might be on strike, but hooky certainly isn't. Police swept 
through West Valley hangouts Tuesday morning, catching 38 truant high school 
and middle school students. Police had received a lot of complaints from 
business owners (B2). . . . The students were quickly returned to their 
respective schools. 
</P>
<P>
 TOO LATE: Can women have it all? Can they put their careers together and then 
turn to motherhood in their late 30s and early 40s? For many, the answer is no. 
They've simply waited too long. Says Marilyn Shenker, 44, a therapist intern 
who runs a support group in Sherman Oaks: "By the time we're ready to have a 
kid, we're ready to enter menopause." (E1).

DANA PARSONS: FEELINGS ON FREED MOLESTERS HARD TO PUT IN ONE SENTENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Dana Parsons 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sometimes I wish I were more conservative of thought. Political and social 
conservatives I've known over the years (they're everywhere, you know) seem to 
do much less teeth-gnashing about issues. As a result, they probably have much 
less heart trouble. How come they're so sure of themselves? 
</P>
<P>
 Near the top of my list of Teeth-Gnashers is what society should do about 
paroled or freed child molesters who return to live in their neighborhoods. You 
don't have to be a parent to worry about the question, but if you are, your 
concern is intensified many times over. 
</P>
<P>
 For many, the issue is a no-brainer. There would be no concern about the 
molester's return to the neighborhood because he wouldn't be returning to the 
neighborhood. His permanent address would be a jail cell. 
</P>
<P>
 That logic has a certain suasion to it: Unlike other criminal offenders who do 
their time and may never repeat, child molesters tend to be repeaters. None of 
us wants to play Russian roulette with children. 
</P>
<P>
 And yet . . . prison for life? Or, if returned to society after serving their 
time, should they be tagged forever? There was the case not long ago of the 
71-year-old man in San Diego who was required to display a sign reading 
"Convicted Child Molester" in front of his home whenever he sat in the yard. 
Among the "traditional values" the traditional values folks often overlook is 
that people who have paid their debt to society in jail have done just that -- 
paid their debt to society. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Riskin wears three hats that makes him an ideal person to address the 
dilemma. He's a psychotherapist with a family and child counseling practice in 
Santa Ana that specializes in sexuality and related issues. In the course of 
that, he has treated victims of sex abuse and estimates he's counseled dozens 
of molesters over the years. 
</P>
<P>
 Second, Riskin is also a civil libertarian interested in the rights of 
individuals. The third hat he wears is that of a parent of two children. 
</P>
<P>
 During our conversation Tuesday, he succeeded in convincing me this is indeed 
a minefield. If we're interested in preventing molestations, prison without 
therapy for offenders is probably useless, Riskin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Men molest children (or anyone who can't provide what therapists call "healthy 
informed consent") for two basic reasons, Riskin explained. They have a 
higher-than-normal sex drive that then combines with feelings of extreme 
inadequacy in forming a satisfactory sexual and emotional relationship with an 
appropriate peer. 
</P>
<P>
 What the public tends not to understand, Riskin said, is that a strong sex 
drive doesn't all by itself turn someone into a molester. "Take the person 
who's inadequate and feels he can't deal with appropriate partners, but yet he 
doesn't have much of a sex drive," Riskin said. "They're not molesting anyone." 
</P>
<P>
 Riskin said he has given numerous talks to professional groups about the need 
for those two conditions both to exist before someone becomes a molester, and 
that the audiences are always surprised to hear it. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The heartening news, Riskin said, is that he's successfully treated molesters 
by bolstering their belief that they can form meaningful relationships with 
adults. He said a "significant number" of molesters could be minimized as 
dangers to society if they received adequate counseling. 
</P>
<P>
 But that's a huge if and does little to address the question of how residents 
should treat a convicted molester who's back in the neighborhood. Simply put, 
they have no way of knowing whether the molester has been treated or not. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wouldn't call myself an enlightened liberal," Riskin said, "but I can put 
myself in that frame of mind, and assuming he were there, I would educate and 
protect and defend my child with an extra special degree of care. The fact of 
the matter is, there's a reality problem and you can't ignore it. People say, 
'The guy has done his time and he's been punished and he should be left alone.' 
Sure, that's real nice, but do I really want my son or daughter subjected to 
someone that I have no particular reason to believe is not as dangerous as he 
was the first time he went in" to prison? 
</P>
<P>
 While his libertarian leanings tell him a person shouldn't be punished beyond 
incarceration, Riskin said, his therapist's background tells him "that I know 
that no effective way of dealing with these people has taken place on a broad 
basis." 
</P>
<P>
 And the inescapable bottom line, he said, is that the victims of molestation 
sometimes are irreparably damaged for life. 
</P>
<P>
 I was almost glad to hear Riskin is as torn as I. At minimum, he said, paroled 
or released offenders should receive ongoing counseling. He also said he would 
tell his children about any known molester who lived nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 Both of those proposals sound good to me, and yet the issue still seems 
unresolved. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe I should start listening to Rush Limbaugh. I'm sure he has this all 
figured out. 
</P>

MIKE PENNER: GRAND TIME FOR ROUNDBALL ROUND-TABLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A roomful of basketball coaches -- young or old, retired or just hired, any 
description you want -- beats a roomful of lawyers, or hockey owners, any day. 
Just feed them lunch, promise them a captive audience, point them to the 
microphone and your afternoon's entertainment is set. 
</P>
<P>
 "This year's team will be probably our best offensive team I've had since I've 
been at Mater Dei," Gary McKnight said, getting the program at the Orange 
County Sports Assn.'s monthly meeting rolling. "A very good group of guys and 
they really score the points. 
</P>
<P>
 "Defensively, I don't know if they can guard me in a phone booth. We may have 
to play a little zone at times, I don't know." 
</P>
<P>
 Preseason expectations. Every coach has his cross, and it's a bear. 
</P>
<P>
 "After reading the paper the last few weeks," Long Beach State's Seth 
Greenberg said, "I didn't know if you wanted me to speak with you or my 
athletic director, Dave O'Brien, who has us in the top 20 and put out all those 
great ads -- 'We're not going on strike, we're not moving.' Or (assistant AD 
Bill) Shumard, who said in the paper today that, basically, if we don't win 
this year the coaches screwed it up. 
</P>
<P>
 "So I wasn't sure who was supposed to speak -- Mr. Shumard, Mr. O'Brien or 
myself. In fact, I think Oct. 15, I'm going to go in and push some papers 
around on my desk and let them take the first practice." 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Hawking's first practice as head coach at Cal State Fullerton is Saturday 
morning, scheduled for 12:01 a.m., and, "as you know, I'm taking over at an 
unusual time. Coach (Brad) Holland decided to move on to the University of San 
Diego just a few weeks ago, so things have been very hectic around our campus. 
</P>
<P>
 "And we're all looking forward to the challenges ahead. And we know that we 
have a few. At this point, the alumni and the boosters are completely behind 
us, win or tie, they've said. As long as we come out with a win or a tie, we 
have their full support." 
</P>
<P>
 Boosters. Alumni. Oh, Jerry Tarkanian can tell you stories. 
</P>
<P>
 "Going from Long Beach to UNLV was a real experience," Tarkanian noted. "At 
Long Beach, if you lost, the only ones who got mad were about 12 boosters and 
maybe my wife. That's about it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I went to UNLV and my first game, they had so much excitement about me coming 
they sold out the arena, it was 'Tark's First Game' in the headlines. I had a 
radio show for the first time in my career and I thought, 'God, this is really 
wonderful.' I never could get a radio show at Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "I lost my first game and the guy cancels my radio show. The very first game 
and he cancels my radio show. That's a true story." 
</P>
<P>
 That got Alex Omalev, former Fullerton College and Cal State Fullerton coach, 
thinking about his first game at FCC more than three decades ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "I signed on as a drama teacher at Fullerton College, that was my background," 
Omalev said. "Two weeks later, the basketball coach dropped dead. The 
superintendent called me in his office and said, 'Well, you played college 
ball, you'll be the coach.' 
</P>
<P>
 "So Don Johnson, who coached at Cypress, who just retired, was a returning 
letterman and he came to see me. He said, 'Coach, when do we start practice?' I 
said, 'There will be no practice until each one of you guys sells 100 tickets 
to the fall play.' I wanted to make an impression -- I was still the drama 
teacher. 
</P>
<P>
 "And we sold out Plummer Auditorium. And Don Johnson got to start because he 
sold 200 tickets." 
</P>
<P>
 Commercial break. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Bokosky of Chapman University stood up to extol the virtues of Division 
III hoops. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think you'd really enjoy the experience if you ever came over to Chapman 
University to see a Division III game. There's not a lot of dunks. There's not 
a lot of guys blowing by you really fast. What you see are a lot of guys doing 
the same thing you see on ESPN, except they don't make the basket as often. So 
in a lot of ways the games are a little bit funner. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think you identify with the players more, if you've ever gone out and 
played a pickup game yourself. So if you have any time this winter, especially 
if the NBA goes on strike, come out to a Chapman game." 
</P>
<P>
 Rod Baker of UC Irvine got up to plug UC Irvine basketball, which hasn't 
gotten anywhere near the preseason publicity of Big West rival Long Beach, not 
with its sub-top 20 aspirations and non-triangular nine-year-old arena. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're gonna still play in the same building we've been playing in," Baker 
announced. "It's not a pyramid. I don't know what it is, but we're going to 
play there anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do have seats. We do have a floor. So if you do want to see a game, you 
might want to stop by the Bren Center." 
</P>
<P>
 Tarkanian got back up to say a few words on behalf of his longtime assistant, 
Tim Grgurich, who is expected to be named as Rollie Massimino's successor at 
UNLV any hour now. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to see Timmy Grgurich coach," Tarkanian said, "and I want to be his 
biggest supporter. I want to fly on the airplane with his team, and sit behind 
the bench, and watch Timmy suffer." 
</P>
<P>
 Tarkanian called Grgurich "the hardest-working coach I've ever been around. 
He's 1000% loyal. And if he takes the UNLV job, like I think is gonna happen 
today or tomorrow, UNLV will be right back where they were. Overnight, they'll 
be a top 20 team. 
</P>
<P>
 "If Timmy steps on the floor, they'll be a top 20 team this year. And after 
that, they'll be a top 10 team forever." 
</P>
<P>
 What, no comeback by the Shark? 
</P>
<P>
 "No, I don't want to coach," Tarkanian said. "I miss the associations with the 
players, I miss the associations with the coaches and I miss practice, but I 
don't miss the games at all. The games were brutal on me. I'm really enjoying 
myself not being real nervous anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 So he turns out for lunches such as this, to sample the best of both worlds. 
</P>
<P>
 All the fun, all the banter, with only a fraction of the indigestion.

GATOR GONE WILD; FLORIDA'S DEAN FLOURISHES IN SPURRIER SYSTEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GENE WOJCIECHOWSKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In 1993 he was booed, benched and bummed. His tires were slashed--and that was 
after a victory. 
</P>
<P>
 He argued in the huddle. He moped on the sideline. And although no official 
statistics were kept, it is believed that Florida quarterback Terry Dean led 
the team in a category no Gator aspires to: Player Most Likely to Cause 
Visor-Throwing Temper Tantrum by Coach Steve Spurrier . 
</P>
<P>
 "We really don't monitor the visor throws," said offensive tackle Anthony 
Ingrassia. "You just hope they're not directed at you." 
</P>
<P>
 Dean wasn't so lucky last season. He had a 3.89 grade-point average and a 
0.89-second patience level. If he made a mistake, he instantly went into 
mourning. Dean talked a good game, but he didn't always play one. 
</P>
<P>
 "I kind of worried too much," said the new and improved Dean shortly before 
Tuesday's practice. "Fortunately, everything turned out all right." 
</P>
<P>
 All right? Florida is undefeated and ranked No. 1 in both polls. The Gators 
rank second nationally in scoring with 50.8 points a game, fourth in total 
offense with a 505.6-yard average, and fifth in passing offense with a 
306.6-yard average. Best of all, the number of Spurrier's visor hurls is way 
down. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Dean is taking advantage of Spurrier's offensive system, an attack 
so refined that it yawns at the thought of throwing 40 passes a game. The 
Gators regularly use formations with five receivers, which is almost unheard of 
outside the pros. It is an attack without a conscience and Dean, a senior, is 
finally flourishing in it. 
</P>
<P>
 Against New Mexico State in the season opener, Dean passed for seven 
touchdowns--in 1 1/2 quarters. He passed for four more against Kentucky, 
prompting Wildcat Coach Bill Curry and defensive coordinator Mike Archer to 
wonder what exactly had gotten into Dean. 
</P>
<P>
 A season earlier against Kentucky, Dean had thrown four interceptions and was 
jerked from the starting lineup. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know what it is," said Archer, "I think he's trying to show everybody 
that that wasn't him last year. He's playing like he's trying to prove 
everybody wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 If so, Dean is doing a convincing job of it. He passed for 303 yards and two 
touchdowns against Tennessee and four scores against Mississippi. He stumbled 
slightly against Louisiana State last Saturday, but unlike last season, didn't 
show up Sunday morning wearing black. 
</P>
<P>
 There's a reason for that. No longer is Danny Wuerffel, the 1993 Southeastern 
Conference freshman of the year, poised over Dean's shoulder. Dean won the job 
fair and square during spring practice and Spurrier made a commitment: Barring 
disaster or injury, Dean would remain the starter. 
</P>
<P>
 "The quarterback controversy is over," said wide receiver Aubrey Hill, who has 
marveled at Dean's sudden maturity. 
</P>
<P>
 And this from guard Donnie Young: "He had rough going last year. He had a lot 
of head games played on him." 
</P>
<P>
 Not anymore. In 1993, Gator huddles occasionally featured screaming matches 
and near fights. In 1994, the atmosphere is so relaxed that Florida offensive 
linemen take turns quoting lines from movies they saw. "Tombstone" and "The 
Program" are the favorites. 
</P>
<P>
 And no longer do the Gator linemen have to tell the previously hyper Dean to 
calm down on the field. Dean, who has a Division I-A-leading 19 touchdown 
passes, has become a picture of stability and a fence mender too. Unsacked 
after the first three games, Dean thanked his linemen by taking them out to 
dinner. 
</P>
<P>
 "But he got cheap on us," said Ingrassia of the barbecue dinner. "He should 
have taken us to (a steak house)." 
</P>
<P>
 Dean got sacked the next game. 
</P>
<P>
 There are other noticeable differences. In 1993, the thought of Dean with a 
Heisman Trophy was borderline comical--unless, of course, he was posing with 
the one won by Spurrier in 1966. In 1994, Dean and the Heisman can be mentioned 
in the same sentence and nobody laughs. 
</P>
<P>
 And in 1993, Dean sulked and fumed each of the six times he wasn't the Gator 
starter. This summer, however, he got married and suddenly sulking wasn't 
allowed. 
</P>
<P>
 "With Robin, if I have a bad day with football--practice, a bad game--she 
doesn't care," said Dean, a Raider draft questionnaire in his hand. "I'll just 
get home and she makes me wash the dishes." 
</P>
<P>
 Too bad the dish-wash rule wasn't in effect last Oct. 16. That's when Dean 
found himself on the bench for the fourth consecutive game, this time against 
Auburn, his childhood and teen-age favorite. 
</P>
<P>
 Dean grew up in Alabama. His father went to Auburn. So did three uncles, an 
aunt and a cousin. 
</P>
<P>
 "Up until my senior year (in high school), that's about the only school I 
thought about," he said. "I probably still have Auburn pennants up in my room 
at home." 
</P>
<P>
 Auburn offered the much-recruited Dean a scholarship, but there was something 
about then-Coach Pat Dye's run-oriented offense and the possibility of NCAA 
sanctions that scared him. Instead, he signed with Florida, but it wasn't easy. 
</P>
<P>
 Even after making an oral commitment to the Gators and canceling his remaining 
official visits, Dye and then-offensive coordinator Pat Sullivan asked if they 
could take him out to dinner and make a last-ditch pitch. Dean said he wasn't 
going to change his mind, but at his dad's request, he accepted the dinner 
invitation. 
</P>
<P>
 Dye and Sullivan did what they could. They promised to open up the offense, 
relatively speaking, and pleaded with Dean to reconsider. 
</P>
<P>
 Dean thought about it, but not for long. If Sullivan, the former Auburn 
quarterback who won the Heisman Trophy in 1971, had been head coach, Dean said 
he probably would have signed with the Tigers. Instead, it was run-happy Dye. 
And that was that. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, Dean's freshman season, he wasn't in uniform for the Auburn game 
because of tonsillitis. He didn't play against the Tigers in 1992 and was 
relegated to backup status again last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "It bothered me a lot," said Dean, whose grandmother died the week of last 
season's Auburn game. "That was probably the low point of everything. I wanted 
to play that game so bad." 
</P>
<P>
 At last he gets his chance. The Gators face sixth-ranked and undefeated Auburn 
on Saturday at Florida Field. It marks Florida's first game this season against 
an opponent with a winning record. 
</P>
<P>
 "Growing up in Alabama and being an Auburn fan my whole life, to finally get a 
chance to play these guys is like a dream come true," Dean said. 
</P>
<P>
 A victory over Auburn would strengthen the Gators' hold on No. 1 and improve 
the likelihood of a Sugar Bowl appearance and a possible national championship. 
That's all Dean cares about. The Heisman? He never mentions it. 
</P>
<P>
 "No, not at all," said wide receiver Chris Doering. "I've never heard him say 
a word about it." 
</P>
<P>
 That makes sense. Dean has too many other things to do these days--like making 
up for lost time. And on occasion, doing the dishes. Terry Dean's Passing

BASKETBALL COACHING GREAT FRANK MCGUIRE DIES AT 80 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN JEANSONNE, NEWSDAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Frank McGuire, the New York City coach whose "underground railroad" of New 
York recruits was a cornerstone of college basketball's rise in the South, died 
at his home in Columbia, S.C., Tuesday after a long illness. He was 80. 
</P>
<P>
 Complications from a 1992 stroke had added to McGuire's declining health, the 
same year he suffered a broken hip in a fall. He received a pacemaker for an 
irregular heartbeat in late 1991, more than a decade after retiring from 45 
years of coaching high school, service, college and professional basketball. 
His wife and other family members were at his side when he died. 
</P>
<P>
 In on his sport's ground floor from the time he played in the inaugural 
Madison Square Garden game in 1934, McGuire coached St. John's, his alma mater, 
to the 1952 NCAA championship final (an 80-63 loss to Kansas), coached North 
Carolina to the NCAA title in 1957 and, after a single season coaching in the 
NBA in 1962, went about building South Carolina from the ground up, into a 
perennial NCAA tournament team in the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
 He coached or tutored a virtual Who's Who of basketball names -- Wilt 
Chamberlain, Dean Smith, Al McGuire, Lou Carnesecca, Billy Cunningham, Doug 
Moe, Bobby Cremins and Larry Brown among them. As St. John's 
basketball/baseball coach in the early 1950s, McGuire even coached a third 
baseman named Mario Cuomo. 
</P>
<P>
 McGuire coached in the two most remembered games of Chamberlain's historic 
career: Against Chamberlain in the 1957 NCAA championship game, when McGuire's 
North Carolina team defeated Chamberlain and his Kansas teammates in triple 
overtime, 54-53; and for Chamberlain's Philadelphia Warrior team on March 2, 
1962, in Hershey, Pa., when Chamberlain scored his record 100 points against 
the Knicks. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the 1957 North Carolina team that went undefeated in 32 games, 
featuring only New Yorkers in the starting lineup: Lennie Rosenbluth, Pete 
Brennan, Joe Quigg, Tommy Kearns and Bobby Cunningham. 
</P>
<P>
 "New York is my personal territory," McGuire declared at the time. "Duke can 
scout in Philadelphia, and North Carolina State can have the whole country, but 
if anybody wants to move into New York, they need a passport from me." 
</P>
<P>
 McGuire needed no papers to prove his New York roots. A dapper dresser with 
wavy red hair, he carried his native Greenwich Village accent with him. He was 
one of 13 children, born Nov. 8, 1913, the son of a New York policeman. He 
learned his basketball playing for one of the settlement house teams organized 
for poor kids during the Depression, coached by a cartoonist named Ted Carroll. 
</P>
<P>
 Like a character out of an old movie, McGuire lived by simple tenets in a 
simpler time. He believed in promptness and directness and, for years, his 
college practice sessions basically were nothing more than scrimmages, without 
many drills or exercises. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, as recently as 1985, when Tulane temporarily shut down its basketball 
program in the wake of a game-fixing scandal tied to players' drug involvement, 
McGuire -- already retired -- declared that, if he were a young coach, he would 
"take every course on drugs I could find." 
</P>
<P>
 "Smart, good ball-handling, typical New York style," is how Carnesecca, the 
recently retired Hall of Fame coach from St. John's, described the typical 
McGuire team. "And, he was a player's coach." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Brown recently: "He was the greatest game coach I've ever seen in my 
life. He was brutal to me, verbally (critical of mistakes), yet he was always 
there for me." 
</P>
<P>
 Former New York Met pitcher Ed Lynch, named general manager of the Chicago 
Cubs on Monday, remembered that McGuire allowed Lynch to keep his basketball 
scholarship at South Carolina even after he stuck to baseball at the school. 
</P>
<P>
 As a player for St. John's, McGuire participated in the first of Ned Irish's 
successful series of college basketball doubleheaders at Madison Square Garden. 
</P>
<P>
 On Dec. 27, 1934, St. John's opened against Westminster, followed by an 
NYU-Notre Dame game. After graduation, McGuire served in the Navy, based most 
of the time in Chapel Hill, N.C., home of the University of North Carolina, 
which would woo McGuire away from St. John's in 1953. 
</P>
<P>
 Between 1948 and '53, he coached St. John's to 20-victory seasons three times 
and was 102-36. But the basketball game-fixing scandals had rocked New York 
college basketball, and Carnesecca believed that McGuire left New York for 
North Carolina partly out of concern for his son, Frank Jr., who had been born 
with cerebral palsy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe he thought Frank Jr. could be taken care of better down there," 
Carnesecca said. "They had better facilities. But Frank never forgot he was a 
New Yorker; he never forget where he came from." 
</P>
<P>
 McGuire's New York ties, in fact, allowed him to stock his North Carolina 
teams with New York talent that, frankly, was more open to playing college ball 
away from the city because of the scandals. 
</P>
<P>
 "You never recruited against him," Carnesecca said. "You'd say, 'Let's take a 
different route' if he went after a player." 
</P>
<P>
 North Carolina wanted McGuire as a weapon to offset Everett Case's progress in 
forming a basketball power at rival North Carolina State, and McGuire obliged 
with a 164-58 record. It was McGuire who hired Dean Smith as an assistant. 
</P>
<P>
 McGuire then tried the NBA for a season, obliging Chamberlain's wish to play 
"all the time" by literally keeping Chamberlain in every minute of every game 
in 1962, when Chamberlain averaged a record 50.4 points a game. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, after two years of work in public relations, McGuire returned to 
coaching at South Carolina in 1964, where he resumed his "underground railroad" 
to New York players and had six 20-victory seasons in 17 years. 
</P>
<P>
 It was during his stay at South Carolina that McGuire's first wife, Patricia, 
died of cancer in 1967. He remarried in 1973 and is survived by his wife, Jane, 
and two daughters. 
</P>
<P>
 Few of McGuire's mementos remain. In 1987, fire destroyed his home, and the 
only surviving basketball relic was a Sports Illustrated cover photo of McGuire 
and Chamberlain, taken in 1962. Frank McGuire at a Glance 
</P>
<P>
 The career of Frank McGuire, who died Tuesday:

championship in 1957. 
</P>

MIKE DOWNEY: THIS SEASON'S BIGGEST NEW HIT IS 'NFL 90210' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE DOWNEY

<TEXT>
<P>
 For breakfast on Sundays, try Fox and bagels. 
</P>
<P>
 Having just viewed the NFL on Fox TV for the first time, all I can say is, it 
won't be the last. I miss CBS about as much as I miss leisure suits and pet 
rocks. 
</P>
<P>
 They're running a strong program over there at Foxball. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, I sure do like what I see. I like the cute little scoreboard in the 
upper left-hand corner. I like Terry Bradshaw, the merry goofball of TV 
football. I like Jimmy Johnson, the old Cowpoke who now pokes fun at the 
Cowboys and himself. I like James Brown, who plays Larry Sanders to Bradshaw's 
Hank Kingsley. I like Fox's pregame show, halftime show and everything but the 
prime-time shows that follow these shows. 
</P>
<P>
 (OK, except "Married With Children," which is still funnier than anything else 
on Fox, with the possible exception of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.) 
</P>
<P>
 Everybody who expressed horror when the Fox network snookered CBS out of its 
NFL rights should apologize profusely. Fox didn't contaminate football; it 
improved it. Fox took CBS's black eye and opened it. 
</P>
<P>
 For everyone who wanted to keep the old CBS announcers, Fox kept the old CBS 
announcers. If your idea of a good time is watching somebody pump gas into John 
Madden's bus, so be it. If you find Pat Summerall's voice as soothing as flute 
music to a cobra, OK by me. 
</P>
<P>
 I thought Fox would bring in some new voices, but guess I was wrong. People 
prefer familiar sounds. Summerall and Madden are a couple of comfortable 
old-timers -- you know, like the Rolling Stones. 
</P>
<P>
 Others thought Fox would sizzle up the telecast with new innovations. I guess 
they expected Aaron Spelling to produce a pregame show with Heather Locklear 
and Daphne Zuniga arguing over which team was sexier, the 49ers or the Bears. 
</P>
<P>
 What I found on Fox was a fairly conventional NFL telecast. It had the usual 
elements -- highlights, updates and Bradshaw bouncing up and down like he'd 
just drunk a quart of cappuccino. 
</P>
<P>
 Gotta tell ya, I love Terry to pieces. I'll never forget chatting with him in 
New Orleans one day before Denver played San Francisco in a Super Bowl. 
Bradshaw had the audacity to predict that Denver might lose by as much as 55-3. 
Bradshaw was dead wrong about the Broncos. They lost, 55-10. 
</P>
<P>
 Terry Bradshaw is one of the five happiest human beings alive. Robin Williams. 
Dolly Parton. Beavis. Butthead. Bradshaw. That order. 
</P>
<P>
 I don't normally watch much television on Sundays, because I go to the games 
in person. Alas, both my local teams were traveling, and both of them were 
doing so lousy, I didn't feel like traveling with them. 
</P>
<P>
 So, I stayed home and watched TV. Same as a few million other Americans. I 
watched ESPN and NBC and Fox and everything they could throw at me. I didn't 
even have to lower the volume on my remote control, because none of these shows 
involved Dan Dierdorf. 
</P>
<P>
 My morning began with the "Sports Reporters" on ESPN, the show that features 
the esteemed Dick Schaap with three media people. God, I love children's 
programming. 
</P>
<P>
 Next, I watched some of ESPN's pregame package. I thought the four most 
informed people on the air were Andrea Kremer, Robin Roberts, Shelley Smith and 
Lesley Visser. Can't ESPN find a few good men? 
</P>
<P>
 Then I switched to Fox. In my town, Fox is on Channel 11. I like Channel 11 
because it often features my favorite programming, like that guy who teaches 
Frank and Kathie Lee Gifford to love each other better, or that guy who makes 
Jayne Kennedy cry by looking into his psychic crystal ball, or that woman who 
tingles all over because some guy has just invented a great new mop. God, I 
love infomercials. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyway, after Channel 11 opened its sports programming Sunday with something 
called "Greatest Tackles of All-Time" ("Mike Stratton stops Keith Lincoln in 
1964!" "Chuck Bednarik levels Frank Gifford!") I then took a look at the Fox 
network's "NFL Sunday," partly because I wanted to watch it and partly because 
CBS was running "Face the Nation," and, as you know, for more than 25 years in 
this nation, nobody has ever watched "Face the Nation." 
</P>
<P>
 Well, Fox was fun. I particularly liked Jimmy Johnson, who is funnier than 
Mike Ditka, who is funnier than Buddy Ryan, who isn't half as funny as he 
thinks he is, which still makes him twice as funny as Joe Gibbs. 
</P>
<P>
 Later came the game, Rams at Packers, my first actual Foxball experience. And 
guess what? Anytime I wanted to know the score, it was there. Or the time. I 
didn't need to wait for a timeout. I didn't need to wait for Marv Albert on NBC 
to get around to it. (During the Raider-Patriot game Sunday, I did The Times 
crossword puzzle between Marv's score updates, and finished it.) 
</P>
<P>
 All in all, Fox was first-rate. Congratulations to everyone over at our fourth 
major network. I enjoyed Channel 11 so much Sunday, I almost skipped the Raider 
game entirely so I could stay tuned for "Three's Company" re-runs and pro 
wrestling.

A DIFFERENT BALLGAME; HE HAS A MILLION-DOLLAR SEASON IN JAPAN, BUT WON'T GET 
NEAR THAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM JAMESON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 How much would an American baseball team offer a 20-year-old rookie center 
fielder who set a record for reaching base safely in consecutive games, broke 
the old mark for the most hits -- with an average of 1.6 a game -- batted 
around .400 nearly all season and lifted his team into pennant contention? 
</P>
<P>
 In Japan, the price is $120,000. 
</P>
<P>
 No, that's not the pay per hit, or per game. That's the salary for the entire 
1994 season. 
</P>
<P>
 Ichiro Suzuki, a 6-foot, 165-pound left-handed leadoff batter, started the 
season so obscurely that his team, the Orix BlueWave of Kobe, figured it had to 
do something to set him apart from tens of thousands of Japanese with the name 
as common as Smith. 
</P>
<P>
 So they sewed only his first name on his uniform. 
</P>
<P>
 By June, Ichiro needed no further promotion. 
</P>
<P>
 As his average shot above .400 and he launched an on-base streak of 69 
consecutive games -- in three of those he got no hits but was walked -- Japan 
suddenly had a new national hero. 
</P>
<P>
 By September, as he approached 200 hits, fans started chanting, "Ichiro! 
Ichiro!" every time he came to bat. 
</P>
<P>
 A 200-hit season is rare enough in American baseball with a 162-game season. 
In Japan's 59 years of baseball, where seasons have been limited to 130 games 
since 1966, no one had ever had more than 191. 
</P>
<P>
 Ichiro broke that mark in his 116th game, passed the 200-mark with four hits 
in game 122 and finished the season with 210. 
</P>
<P>
 Only at the end did he suffer a slump. From .396, his average fell to .385, 
and in games 127 and 128 -- for the first time all season -- he went two games 
in a row without a hit. 
</P>
<P>
 Randy Bass' 1986 Japanese record of .389 fell out of reach. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, Ichiro failed to get a hit in only 13 of 130 games. His average was 
62 points higher than his closest rival in either league. 
</P>
<P>
 Ichiro credited a new manager with enabling him to burst into full blossom by 
eliminating the "confrontations and differences of opinions" of last year, when 
as a member of Orix's second team -- the equivalent of a minor league team -- 
he batted .188 in a brief stint with Orix's first team. 
</P>
<P>
 "I found a new emotional leeway this year," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ichiro also credited his father, Nobuyuki Suzuki, 52, who operates a small 
electronic parts factory in Nagoya. 
</P>
<P>
 "He played catch with me every day," Ichiro said in a TV interview. "He came 
to see me play in games every day. He bought all sorts of equipment for me. He 
went through a lot of trouble for me." 
</P>
<P>
 Waiting for the pitcher to deliver, Ichiro twirls his bat with his right hand. 
Then he grasps the bat with both hands and lifts his right foot as he begins to 
swing and follows through, the Japanese say, "like a pendulum." 
</P>
<P>
 Spraying his hits all over the field, he is as graceful punching a low, 
outside pitch down the left field line as he is pulling a waist-high strike 
past the first baseman down the right field line. Near the end of the season, 
Japanese reporters tracked 55 of his hits to right field, 47 to left and 51 
from left-center to right-center. Even his infield hits were almost as evenly 
dispersed. 
</P>
<P>
 Outfielders play him straight away -- and deep. 
</P>
<P>
 "A batter gets his balance through the knees, the hips or the arms," said Isao 
Harimoto, one of Japan's all-time great hitters. "Ichiro gets his through both 
his legs and his arms. Very few players do that." 
</P>
<P>
 Ichiro's swing is faster, and he begins it with the ball closer to the plate, 
than did either Harimoto or the legendary Sadaharu Oh, according to 
sports-research experts at Tsukuba University. 
</P>
<P>
 If Ichiro played in the U.S. major leagues, he might have trouble with the 
speed of American pitchers, said Suguru Egawa, a former star pitcher for the 
Yomiuri Giants who is now a commentator. 
</P>
<P>
 Ichiro disagreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "As long as the ball is thrown by a human being, I have the confidence to hit 
any pitch, no matter how fast it comes," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I've never even thought of playing in the major leagues. If I did, I'd 
probably only hit .250." 
</P>
<P>
 Between October and December last year, he played in the triple-A Hawaii 
winter league and batted .311. The main trouble there, he said, was getting 
used to a wider strike zone. 
</P>
<P>
 By current standards, even a .250 average would make Ichiro a bargain to an 
American team at his present salary. Ichiro's contract, signed last year when 
he played for the Orix's second team, called for only $80,000, but as a 
first-team player, he will get the guaranteed minimum pay of $120,000. 
</P>
<P>
 No one questions that Ichiro is in line for a hefty pay increase next year -- 
but it might be no higher than $300,000, according to Egawa. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any more than that for a sophomore player would make him stand out too much" 
in a society with a strong egalitarian sense of keeping up with -- but not 
surpassing -- the Joneses, Egawa said. 
</P>
<P>
 Egawa recalled that after both he and the Dodgers' Fernando Valenzuela had won 
20 games for the first time in the same year, "my salary didn't even double. 
His went up 10 times." 
</P>
<P>
 Even as average Japanese wages in all fields -- now about $55,000 -- have shot 
past standards in the United States, baseball pay here lags behind. Egawa 
estimated that average pay runs about $350,000, compared with more than $1 
million in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Ichiro indicated he was thinking of more than keeping up with the Joneses. 
"There is no previous example with which to make a comparison," Ichiro said of 
his 1994 performance. "I expect a raise for which there is no precedent." 
</P>
<P>
 Shown a list of Japanese baseball's 101 best-paid players, all receiving 
$460,000 or more, he was asked if he thought he deserved to join their ranks. 
"Of course!" he replied in very un-Japanese style. 
</P>
<P>
 He also said he was thinking of moving out of the cramped Orix dormitory room 
he now occupies and perhaps buying a house. 
</P>
<P>
 Japan's tradition-minded owners only recently have started loosening the purse 
strings for home-grown players -- Americans playing here earn more than most 
Japanese. 
</P>
<P>
 After years of demands from players and facing the pressure of competition 
from a new professional soccer league -- which offered million-dollar salaries 
in its first year -- owners in 1993 finally gave ballplayers the right of free 
agency, 17 years after it had happened in American baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 Hiromitsu Ochiai, 40, first baseman for the Central League's Yomiuri Giants, 
took advantage of it and got $3.7 million, $1.6 million more than any other 
player this year. The one-time triple crown winner, however, batted only .280 
and hit 15 home runs, only two more than Ichiro. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago, there were only five players earning $1 million or more in 
Japan. This year, the number shot up to 29. 
</P>
<P>
 By comparison, Oh, who hit 868 home runs in his career -- 113 more than Hank 
Aaron's 755 -- never got more than $800,000, calculated at the current exchange 
rate, and never made it to the top of the best-paid list in a 22-year career 
that ended in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
 Egawa said Japanese owners were wary of the track record of salaries 
multiplying by 20 times under the U.S. free-agent system and predicted they 
would "make sure that won't happen here." 
</P>
<P>
 "Japan is very good at looking at the United States and deciding what to do," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Players are allowed to exercise the free-agent right to change teams only once 
in their careers and only after 10 years. As a result, changing teams, like 
changing jobs in Japan, is still the exception. 
</P>
<P>
 Egawa said he understood the arguments of both the players and the management 
in the U.S. baseball strike. But he said such a strike would be most unlikely 
in Japan. Although strikes are permitted, Japanese customs and social pressure 
work against such radical actions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Harsh public criticism" of Ochiai, for instance, is likely to ensure that his 
$3.7-million windfall winds up as an aberration, not a precedent, Egawa 
predicted. 
</P>
<P>
 Ichiro, for his part, said he saw nothing wrong with fat American salaries for 
players "who have that much talent and put on a performance for the fans." But 
he, too, called the thought of a baseball strike in Japan inconceivable. 
</P>
<P>
 Economic factors also stand in the way of skyrocketing salaries here. Only 
three teams own their own stadiums, and national television revenue is 
minuscule for 10 of 12 teams in the two leagues, Egawa said. Only Yomiuri and 
Seibu Lions games are regularly shown on national TV. Most owners write off 
their teams' losses as advertising for their companies' main business in other 
fields. Orix, for example, is a leasing company. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever his salary next year, Ichiro will be forced to deal with fans' 
expectations "to shoot for a .400 average," Egawa predicted. 
</P>
<P>
 To achieve it, Ichiro will have to stop going after bad pitches and accept 
more than twice the walks he got this year, 51, the former pitcher said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ichiro can hit virtually any pitch within his own huge strike zone -- and 
that's the way you get more than 200 hits," Egawa said. "But if you're aiming 
for a .400 average, you've got to be more choosy. Even for Ichiro, the average 
for bad pitches that he turns into hits is lower than for the strikes he hits." 
</P>
<P>
 Ichiro said he understood Egawa's criticism. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't consider a walk useless, but I'd rather get a hit," he said. Ichiro 
Suzuki at a Glance 
</P>
<P>
 Accomplishments of Ichiro Suzuki during 1994 Japanese season: 
</P>
<P>
 * Had 210 hits, breaking record of 191. 
</P>
<P>
 * Reached base by hit or walk in 69 consecutive games. 
</P>
<P>
 * Had hits in 117 of 130 games. 
</P>
<P>
 * Batted .385, short of Randy Bass' record of .389.

THE LOCKOUT TO CONTINUE INDEFINITELY; HOCKEY: THE PLAYERS' LATEST PROPOSAL IS 
CALLED "A STEP BACKWARD" BY BETTMAN. NO TALKS ARE SCHEDULED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman indefinitely delayed the start of the season 
here Tuesday, calling the last proposal by the players union "a step backward" 
and questioning its good faith. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Goodenow, executive director of the NHL Players Assn., contended that 
Bettman's interpretation "just highlights our differences," adding, "It looks 
awfully difficult for us to be making progress in the near future. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've always told the players that this could be a long situation. Long could 
be months or a year." 
</P>
<P>
 When Bettman postponed the season's original Oct. 1 start, he reserved the 
possibility of allowing games to be played Saturday if he saw movement in the 
talks. With the unanimous backing of the league's Board of Governors, however, 
he declared Tuesday that no ground had been gained and that the season would 
not begin until an agreement is reached. 
</P>
<P>
 "After reviewing the proposal, the board concluded there was no meaningful 
progress over the last 10 days," Bettman said. "In fact, the board was a little 
baffled over the union's course of conduct over the last 10 days and the delays 
we've had in meeting." 
</P>
<P>
 He again avoided describing his action as a lockout. When pressed, he said the 
league had been in "a postponement mode" while a Saturday start was still 
possible. With that hope gone, he said, "You can draw your own conclusions." 
</P>
<P>
 Goodenow spent five days preparing the plan he presented to Bettman on Monday 
in Toronto. It focused solely on the pivotal issue of the dispute -- how to 
subsidize small-market clubs -- and did not address differences on free agency 
and arbitration. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the proposal was a comprehensive plan for that single issue, but 
Bettman said the plan's incompleteness indicated that Goodenow meant to slow 
the talks and maintain the status quo. 
</P>
<P>
 No further talks are scheduled, although Bettman and Goodenow said they will 
stay in touch. 
</P>
<P>
 "At this point, you have to believe it might last all year," said Harry 
Sinden, the Boston Bruins' president and general manager. 
</P>
<P>
 From Edmonton General Manager Glen Sather, whose Oilers would benefit from the 
small-market supports, to Mighty Duck President Tony Tavares -- whose club's 
$9-million profits last season ranked among the league's highest -- club 
executives joined Bettman at an afternoon news conference in a show of unity. 
</P>
<P>
 "Players just don't really seem to know what's going on," Sather said. "I saw 
that a couple of players on the Calgary Flames, after the team opened the books 
and showed them a ($3-million) loss, were quoted (in newspapers) as saying a 
$1-million gain can be turned into a $1-million loss with the stroke of a 
pencil. They don't get it." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Tavares: "We have a very, very high incentive to play this season. But 
that incentive is a short-term incentive versus a need for systemic change for 
the league to make sure the league is flourishing in the future. Right now, if 
you look at the prognosis, it's terminal. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's kind of difficult when you're suffering congestive heart failure, to be 
told, 'Take three aspirin.' That's what (the players) told us with their last 
proposal." 
</P>
<P>
 Through Tuesday, 57 games had been postponed. A full season might still be 
played by adding missed games to the end of the schedule, but that faint hope 
wilted in the face of the anger shown by the principal figures Tuesday. Bettman 
said the cancellation of games will be reviewed daily, beginning Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Until the union is willing to address our needs and come back to us with a 
system that is sensible and allows us to grow, we're not going to have a deal," 
Bettman said. "We're not looking to take back (salary increases). We're looking 
to go forward and at dealing with the escalation of salaries." 
</P>
<P>
 The union's proposal sought to alleviate the financial woes of small-market 
clubs by imposing a gradual levy of up to 7% on the 16 top revenue-earning 
clubs. It would also have imposed a flat 3% levy on the gate receipts of the 
top 16 revenue clubs. 
</P>
<P>
 The NHL's previous two proposals, which Goodenow rejected a week ago, included 
a gradual levy on all payrolls of a half-percent per million dollars up to $14 
million. After that, the rate would have risen by 5% for every $325,000 to a 
maximum of 122%. A flat levy of 3% would have been imposed on the gate receipts 
of the top 16 revenue-earning clubs and credited against the payroll levy. 
</P>
<P>
 Goodenow said those measures constituted a salary cap, because clubs would 
limit expenditures on salaries for fear of triggering higher levies. He said 
his plan addressed the NHL's stated concerns without restricting the growth of 
salaries through a rookie salary cap or the abolition of arbitration. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Tuesday's) unfortunate decision makes it absolutely clear the NHL is not 
interested in the fans, the games and the small-market clubs and is only 
interested in a fight with the players," he said. "The NHL has not moved in its 
demands. . . . Until the owners appreciate (that) the players are completely 
opposed to their take-away demands, we'll have little to discuss." 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Corkum, the Ducks' union representative, rejected Bettman's contention 
that players simply want to maintain the status quo. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we want is to market ourselves and be able to go into the market and 
have teams bid on us," he said. "We just want to have a solid marketplace to 
shop our skills. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's not even talk about all the years owners had players in their hip 
pockets. They were out of sight, out of mind. Now the players are understanding 
the business. We know what's right and we don't feel we should be held back in 
any way, shape or form. I'm not saying we have things terrible right now. But 
if we did sign any one of Gary's proposals we'd be cutting our own throats." 
</P>
<P>
 Goodenow said the union will support players who want to play in Europe or in 
the International Hockey League during the lockout, but cautioned that he 
doesn't know if legal obstacles might rule out those options. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he would investigate those possibilities if the lockout drags on. 
</P>
<P>
 Players fear it might last long enough to wipe out the season entirely. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope not," veteran King forward Pat Conacher said. "But then you look at 
what has happened in baseball, no World Series. Nothing is beyond the realm. 
That's the scary part."

CONVERTED USC TAILBACK FINDS NEW DREAM ON DEFENSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EARL GUSTKEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Like every athlete, Scott Fields dreamed. 
</P>
<P>
 He dreamed of going to USC and becoming the fifth Trojan tailback to win the 
Heisman Trophy. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a good dream. 
</P>
<P>
 And who would say his was an impossible dream? 
</P>
<P>
 He was an All-American at La Puente Bishop Amat, where he averaged 6.5 yards a 
carry his senior year. 
</P>
<P>
 He had speed, size and a belief that he was a young man of destiny, that 
somewhere out there was a Heisman Trophy display case with his name on it. 
</P>
<P>
 And then the dream began to die. 
</P>
<P>
 It started coming apart in the first half of the 1993 season, shortly after 
Fields had been given the chance he wanted. 
</P>
<P>
 He had started the season as a backup sophomore tailback, behind starter 
Dwight McFadden. In the opening-game loss to North Carolina, McFadden suffered 
a broken ankle in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Enter Fields. 
</P>
<P>
 He ran well, with a slashing, charging style that reminded some of Marcus 
Allen. 
</P>
<P>
 But there was a problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Fumbles. 
</P>
<P>
 They became unacceptably frequent, and Fields became a backup again. 
</P>
<P>
 Two days after the regular season, Fields was called to see Coach John 
Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
 "He told me he had a choice for me," Fields said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said I could stay at running back, but he couldn't guarantee me playing 
time. But he said if I agreed to move to (defensive back), I would get much 
more playing time. 
</P>
<P>
 "I said, 'Fine, that's what I want to do. I want to play.' 
</P>
<P>
 "He said he thought I could be a good safety, with a lot of work, and he 
pointed out only two safeties would be coming back for this season, Micah 
Phillips and Sammy Knight." 
</P>
<P>
 And so Fields played in USC's defensive backfield in last season's Freedom 
Bowl victory over Utah. And he has been a kind of co-starter with Knight this 
season at strong safety. 
</P>
<P>
 Fields' older brother, Arby, says Scott called him after the meeting with 
Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a blow to Scott, frankly," Arby Fields said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Scott went to USC to win the Heisman. He told me of the choice Robinson had 
given him, and what his decision was. I think his first reaction was, 'Did I 
fail?' 
</P>
<P>
 "We talked a lot that night, and I think he came away with a very good 
attitude, starting that night. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told him, 'Look, you've got a lot going for you. You're on the USC football 
team, for one thing. How many guys can say that? Now you can either sulk, or 
get your head up and be successful.' 
</P>
<P>
 "He's still learning (to play safety), and his athletic ability will carry him 
a long way. And so will his attitude." 
</P>
<P>
 Fields' position coach, Keith Burns, used that same word in talking about 
Fields. 
</P>
<P>
 "When Scott decided to come over to (defense), I didn't know what his attitude 
would be," Burns said. "I didn't know if his disappointment at the move would 
affect his performance. 
</P>
<P>
 "It hasn't. He's been great -- he's working extremely hard to become an 
outstanding safety. It's a tough position to play because any mistake you make 
out there is magnified. Everyone sees it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Scott made two mistakes in the Oregon game, and one resulted in a 50-yard 
touchdown run when he missed a tackle near the line of scrimmage. The other was 
when he committed pass interference on a play when he was late getting to the 
deep middle. 
</P>
<P>
 "At safety, if you miss a tackle or muff an assignment, usually no one's 
backing you up. A defensive lineman has a linebacker backing him up, and a 
linebacker has secondary people behind him. There's no one behind the 
safeties." 
</P>
<P>
 Fields, a 6-foot-3, 200-pound junior, is still listed as USC's backup strong 
safety, behind Knight, a 6-1, 195-pound sophomore. But they have roughly split 
playing time. 
</P>
<P>
 "Scott is still learning to read keys, before and after the snap," Burns said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's picked it up a little faster than I expected. A good safety man really 
has to believe in his instincts, and Scott will get there with more playing 
time." 
</P>
<P>
 In the 22-7 loss to Oregon, Fields had three unassisted tackles, a pass 
interception and a pass breakup. Against Oregon State's wishbone last Saturday, 
in a 27-19 victory, he was an outside linebacker. 
</P>
<P>
 Fields has an edge in his hurry-up safety schooling, Burns said. 
</P>
<P>
 "In practice every day, he has pretty good quarterbacks to look at in Rob 
Johnson and Brad Otton, good wide receivers in Keyshawn Johnson and Ken Grace, 
and a great group of tight ends. So he's getting a good picture, every day." 
</P>
<P>
 He'll get a good picture Saturday, too -- of Steve Stenstrom, the Stanford 
quarterback who leads the Pacific 10 Conference in passing efficiency and has 
passed nearly 200 times in five games. 
</P>
<P>
 Fields sees that as a challenge, not a threat. 
</P>
<P>
 "That means more (interceptions), hopefully," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Heisman dream is part of his past now, and a new dream unfolds. 
</P>
<P>
 "My goal is to win the Jim Thorpe Award (awarded to the nation's best 
defensive back)," he said. Only one Trojan has won that, Mark Carrier, in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Fields says changing positions was difficult only in the early going. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was hard at first -- all my life I'd been a running back and I'd always 
wanted to win the Heisman at SC and be a running back in the NFL. And to see 
that dream fade, well, I decided I needed new goals." 
</P>
<P>
 Fields said he realized after the conversation with Robinson that he was first 
and foremost a football player. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wasn't starting at tailback and I wasn't happy at that," he said. "I wanted 
to play in any position where I'd be more involved with the football team, to 
be a contributor to our winning championships." 
</P>
<P>
 His challenge now, he says, is one of the most demanding in sports. 
</P>
<P>
 "Covering a fast guy one-on-one, it's really hard," he said. "It's a lot like 
basketball, guarding a great player, getting through picks and screens."

LA PAZ OR EL DORADO?; 'BUTLER'S BAY' DEFINITELY RICH IN MARLIN, SAILFISH AND 
TUNA, BUT BEST THING IS, YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO FAR TO GET THEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETE THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 High atop a desert road an hour or so from town, the sky seems to open, and, 
looking down, a sea of towering cacti gives way to the vast and beautiful Sea 
of Cortez. 
</P>
<P>
 The sun seems to actually rise from the edge of the sea, a wavering ball of 
fire that sets the morning sky aglow. The gulf is deserted, its glassy surface 
yet unbroken by the local commercial fishing fleet. Cerralvo Island, 
silhouetted by the sun, looms off the coast, a dark and barren mass. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is my favorite spot in all of Baja, this view," said Bob Butler, 
squinting as he gazed out over the arroyos toward the sunlit horizon. 
</P>
<P>
 But if all is quiet on the shimmering sea, beneath the surface an aquamarine 
world is buzzing with life. 
</P>
<P>
 Marlin and sailfish use the new day's light to seek out and slash at schools 
of bait fish. Sleek and slender wahoo, with speed to burn and teeth like 
needles, patrol the channels and underwater canyons. Man-sized pargo lurk in 
the cavernous depths, ready to inhale anything that swims by. 
</P>
<P>
 Each summer and fall, tuna roam the blue water, covering great distances in 
their search for food, often swimming beneath leaping porpoises. 
</P>
<P>
 And the most colorful and acrobatic fish in the sea -- dorado, called mahi 
mahi in Hawaii -- flock to anything that floats and thus are easy pickings for 
anyone with rod and reel. 
</P>
<P>
 Butler's friends call this area "Butler's Bay," because for 15 years he has 
been doing business here. He runs his panga -fishing operation out of his home 
in La Paz, but it is one of only two -- the other is the Mosquito Fleet -- that 
concentrate on the remote waters off Punta Arena de la Ventana, or Las Arenas, 
about 30 miles southeast of the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the crowded waters off Cabo San Lucas, where several boats often chase 
one marlin, and where the smell of diesel exhaust fills the air, those off Las 
Arenas are uncluttered and pristine. Game fish thrive almost a stone's throw 
from shore. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's great," said Roger Rosen, 49, a West Los Angeles attorney who has fished 
throughout Mexico and recently made his first visit to Las Arenas. "There's 
nobody on the beach there, and what's really neat is that you get into a panga 
and 15-20 minutes later you're fishing. There are tons of tuna, and tons of 
dorado right there." 
</P>
<P>
 Butler's operation runs smoothly now, but it got off to a rocky start in 1981, 
partly because of the rough-edged pangeros hired from the ejido , or fishing 
village of San Pedro, who were not only largely separated from Mexican society 
-- many never leave home except for a quick trip to La Paz for supplies -- but 
lacked any real contact with gringos . 
</P>
<P>
 "They all had these long, dark beards and their clothes were held together by 
safety pins . . . they looked like gangsters," Butler recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 Their pangas had no floorboards, offered only hard wooden benches to sit on 
and no shelter from a relentless Baja sun powerful enough to burn skin through 
a T-shirt. 
</P>
<P>
 Butler said that before he took one of his first groups to the area, he hired 
three cabin cruisers with La Paz-based skippers used to dealing with Americans 
to meet them at the beach, just in case. 
</P>
<P>
 The passengers got dropped off the next morning, took one look at the cruisers 
and another at pangeros and scrambled to the cruisers. 
</P>
<P>
 "But those guys in the pangas , they really know the area, and they outfished 
the cruisers to the point where by the third day, the (passengers) were all 
fighting to get into the pangas ," Butler said. 
</P>
<P>
 His skippers still hail from San Pedro. But most of them have done well enough 
with the money Butler pays -- significantly more than they could make selling 
fish to a broker in the refrigerated truck who comes to the beach each 
afternoon -- to buy proper clothing and outfit their pangas with swivel-seats 
and canopies for shade. 
</P>
<P>
 They call Butler at his home in La Paz every afternoon to see how many boats 
he needs the next day, and are waiting on the beach at the crack of dawn. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A recent trip with Butler began at 5 a.m., when the rest of La Paz was asleep. 
Leaving the city, the van entered a land watched over seemingly by nothing but 
cardon cactus, some 30 feet high. The trips are perfectly timed in that the van 
reaches the top of the hill, where the sea comes into view, as the sun begins 
to emerge on the horizon. 
</P>
<P>
 The van rolled on, through a countryside cut with deep canyons and lush with 
desert vegetation rejuvenated by recent rains. At the bottom of the hill is the 
agricultural community of San Juan De Los Planes, surrounded by fields of 
chilies, cotton, tomatoes and corn. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearer the beach is San Pedro, the community of commercial fishermen. 
</P>
<P>
 The paved road ends here and the short ride to the beach is bumpy, but 
tolerable. A huge salt marsh is visible a quarter-mile or so from the water. 
Workers in long pants and long-sleeved shirts use long, broom-like instruments 
to work the shallow pits and push the salt into piles. The marsh is protected 
from sea breezes by dunes and the temperatures reach well into the 100s, yet 
the workers toil throughout much of the day. 
</P>
<P>
 At the beach, the commercial fishermen had already left, motoring off to and 
beyond Cerralvo Island, a 15-mile-long land mass where wild goats graze and 
whose waters are notorious for giant snapper, or pargo. 
</P>
<P>
 Two pangeros remained for Butler and another group. One of them, Gildardo 
Lucero, a 44-year-old man with a sun-wrinkled face, is called "the Predator" by 
Butler because of his knack for finding fish. 
</P>
<P>
 It soon became apparent, however, that one doesn't always need such a knack in 
this part of the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Schools of bait fish, being chased from below, were fluttering on the surface 
in large patches offshore. 
</P>
<P>
 Not five minutes from the beach, a sailfish "spy-hopped" twice not 30 feet 
from the boat, sticking its head out of the water as if to get a better look at 
these intruders. 
</P>
<P>
 Butler, using a light rig with 16-pound test, cast a live sardine and within 
seconds the sailfish was hooked. It came to life immediately, dancing on its 
tail and shaking its head. When that didn't shake the hook, it ran off 50 yards 
of line in about five seconds and then leaped and tail-walked again. 
</P>
<P>
 Butler had it to the boat in about 15 minutes, though, and the Predator 
carefully unhooked the quivering billfish and let it go. 
</P>
<P>
 He then set a course for a series of buoys rigged by commercial fishermen with 
chunks of fish used to catch sharks. But sharks were not what the Predator was 
after. A live sardine cast to a buoy immediately produced a hookup with a 
fair-sized dorado that leaped and shook. 
</P>
<P>
 When Butler reeled his fish within range, the Predator stuck it with his gaff 
and plopped it into the hold at the bow of his boat. "We need a few fish for 
dinner tonight," Butler said. 
</P>
<P>
 While he was fighting the fish, the water came alive as others, thrown into a 
frenzy, began darting about, flashing colors of metallic green and yellow. The 
fish are off limits to commercial fishermen and thus thrive throughout southern 
Baja. 
</P>
<P>
 "This has been the best dorado fishing in all the 25 years I've lived here," 
Butler said. "You could throw anything in and catch one." 
</P>
<P>
 The Predator went to another buoy and, in another panga , Butler's nephew, 
Cody, and a friend, George Cole, were hooked up to larger fish, eventually 
muscling 20-pounders to the boat. 
</P>
<P>
 Butler later hooked one estimated at closer to 50 pounds. It was too much for 
the huffing and puffing 65-year-old, however, breaking his light line after 
half an hour. 
</P>
<P>
 The Predator winced, fired up his engine and moved on. The only other boat in 
sight was a private cruiser skippered by an American who was fishing alone. He 
was leaning over the rail trying to remove a hook from a large billfish when 
the Predator arrived. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anyone want a blue marlin?" the man asked. 
</P>
<P>
 When told no, he popped the hook loose and the big billfish swam to freedom. 
Butler asked him if he had located any tuna and he replied, "Not yet, but 
that's what I'm looking for." 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the tuna in this area had been almost 100 pounds, although most have 
been closer to 30. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those are the ones I'm after," Cole said. "The big ones are more work than 
anything else." 
</P>
<P>
 It didn't matter. Not even the Predator, it seemed, could find the tuna. Or 
the porpoises they often follow. 
</P>
<P>
 The fishermen didn't care. The sun had begun to take its toll. Sweat poured 
freely and the only relief came when the boat was moving, creating an 
artificial breeze. 
</P>
<P>
 The Predator made one last stop on the way back, about 100 yards off a barren 
part of the coast called Punta Perico. There was little reason for optimism; 
the ocean seemed lifeless. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tuna," the Predator said, pointing down. 
</P>
<P>
 No one quite believed him, but everyone cast anyway. To the surprise of some, 
line began to spin from one of the passenger's reels. He clicked it into gear 
and the rod tip bent and the hook was set. 
</P>
<P>
 A small yellowfin tuna was brought to the surface, gaffed and thrown into the 
hold. Another hookup resulted in another tuna. Before long the boat was 
surrounded by feeding fish. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's why he's called the Predator," Butler said, smiling. 
</P>
<P>
 Dozens of fish were landed before the fishermen quit. 
</P>
<P>
 After the boat hit the beach and the fish were cleaned, the van headed for La 
Paz. When it reached the memorable summit on B.C. 286, no one looked back.

LINHART THE LION-HEARTED; NORTHRIDGE SOCCER STALWART DOES WHAT HE MUST TO BLUNT 
THE ATTACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE HISERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ross Linhart was startled by the outburst, then mildly amused. 
</P>
<P>
 Marwan Ass'ad, the excitable and demonstrative coach of the Cal State 
Northridge soccer team, was verbally accelerating, shifting gears between 
measured scold and theatrical tirade. 
</P>
<P>
 Moments earlier, a University of San Diego player had scored a goal against 
the Matadors, prompting Ass'ad to broadcast -- dramatically -- the errors of 
Linhart's ways. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't until Ass'ad finally paused to take a breath that Linhart managed to 
sneak a couple of words in edgewise. 
</P>
<P>
 "Wasn't me," he said coolly. 
</P>
<P>
 "What?" screeched Ass'ad. 
</P>
<P>
 "Wasn't me," Linhart repeated, dabbing at blood trailing from a two-inch gash 
between his eyes. "(The referee) made me come out because of this and they 
scored 30 seconds after I left the field." 
</P>
<P>
 The coach should have known. Bad things usually don't happen to Northridge 
when Linhart is patrolling on defense. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider the Matadors' record last season: 11 wins and two losses with Linhart 
in the lineup; one win and seven losses while he was recovering from various 
injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 A coincidence? Ass'ad doesn't think so. "The record speaks for itself," he 
said. "Ross is the best. He makes everybody around him play better." 
</P>
<P>
 Linhart, who, depending on one's terminology of choice, plays either fullback, 
sweeper or defender, is Northridge's last line of defense before its 
goalkeeper. 
</P>
<P>
 Let it never be said he plays "matador" -- as in Ole! -- defense. Rather, 
compare him to a Secret Service agent who might sacrifice his body to take a 
bullet, or an elite soldier who would throw himself on top of a live grenade. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's not afraid of anybody," Ass'ad said. "He does whatever it takes to 
tackle the ball." 
</P>
<P>
 Hence Linhart's personal motto: "Get the ball or get the man, but don't miss 
both." 
</P>
<P>
 Linhart protects the Northridge goal as if his life depended on it, often 
risking substantial injury to his rather ordinary 5-foot-10, 155-pound frame. 
</P>
<P>
 "We call it the Linhart Rage," Ass'ad said. "When it comes to game-time he 
hates people. They're the enemy. That's the only way he knows how to play." 
</P>
<P>
 Dare challenge him and even teammates become targets. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before we do, say, a 4-on-4 drill in practice, I'll say to him, 'Hey, this is 
meant to develop skill, quickness and balance, so don't kill anybody,' Ass'ad 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'OK, coach.' "But then someone will win the ball from him and that's it. 
He's the enemy." 
</P>
<P>
 Matt Davis, who, as a forward, often duels with Linhart during practice, said 
his teammate's aggressiveness initially angered him. 
</P>
<P>
 "But that was before I understood Ross," he said. "He is the most intense 
person on the team, without a doubt." 
</P>
<P>
 Linhart, a junior, came to Northridge after an injury-riddled career at Wilson 
High in Hacienda Heights, "a no-name soccer school in a no-name city," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Knowing only that Linhart had been a good enough youth player to take part in 
a U.S. Olympic Development program, Ass'ad didn't offer him a scholarship. 
</P>
<P>
 'We couldn't afford to take a chance on a guy I hadn't seen play," the coach 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Linhart enrolled at Northridge anyway, trying out for the team as a walk-on. 
What a steal. He started all 18 games in his freshman season and has been on 
scholarship ever since. He has started every match for which he's been healthy 
and eligible. 
</P>
<P>
 Ass'ad already is convinced that Linhart has a future in professional soccer, 
assuming at some point he adopts an off-season training ethic that matches the 
ferocious effort he puts forth during the season. 
</P>
<P>
 "If Ross was 170, 175 pounds he would kill people," Ass'ad said. "He needs to 
lift weights, take care of his body." 
</P>
<P>
 As it is, Linhart usually is nursing some sort of gash, scrape, bruise or 
muscle pull. 
</P>
<P>
 "His body just can't keep up with his game," Ass'ad said. "He has such desire. 
He takes things personal, man, and to be great on defense, that's how you have 
to be." 
</P>
<P>
 Defense is all Linhart has played since age 12, when he successfully completed 
an assignment to "mark" the star scorer on an opposing youth team in a 
championship match. 
</P>
<P>
 Not scoring doesn't bother him. "I take pride in team," he said. "I don't mind 
not getting glory as long as we win." 
</P>
<P>
 Nor does he seem to mind getting gory. 
</P>
<P>
 Linhart, 20, is studying biological psychology, a field he describes as 
"understanding how injuries to the body can have a psychological effect on the 
mind." 
</P>
<P>
 Standing near the Northridge soccer field before a recent practice, Linhart 
appears qualified to conduct his own study. In addition to the gash on his 
forehead, he has scrapes on both knees and a lacerated left hip. 
</P>
<P>
 A teammate says Linhart "is pretty loony. A lot of people think he's a little 
crazy, not playing with a full deck, you know?" 
</P>
<P>
 That's one of his best attributes.

GIANTS FIRE VALLEY SCOUTING LEGEND GENOVESE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE ELLING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 George Genovese, a coach and scout in the San Francisco Giants' organization 
for the past 34 years, said Tuesday he has been fired, apparently because of 
strike-related budget cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 Genovese, 72, said he has been told that his contract as the team's Southern 
California scout will not be renewed in 1995 and that he will not receive 
retirement benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel betrayed," said Genovese, who lives in North Hollywood. "I gave my 
loyalty to the Giants for 34 years. You just don't treat people this way." 
</P>
<P>
 In scouting circles, Genovese is a Southland legend. Among the players he 
signed are Garry Maddox, Gary Matthews, Jack Clark, Dave Kingman, George 
Foster, Bobby Bonds, Royce Clayton and Matt Williams. 
</P>
<P>
 Genovese said he signed 43 players who eventually made the Giants' 40-man 
roster. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, his storied career came crashing down. On Sept. 16, Genovese said 
he received a call from Bob Hartsfield, the Giants' director of scouting. 
</P>
<P>
 Hartsfield told Genovese that his contract would not be renewed when it 
expires Dec. 31 and offered no explanation behind the decision. Last week, 
Genovese received a letter from Brian Sabean, the team's vice president of 
scouting and player personnel. The letter also did not specify why Genovese was 
released, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The team's director of public relations, Bob Rose, said Tuesday night that the 
team had made several layoffs but that most of the personnel was expected to be 
rehired when the strike is resolved. 
</P>
<P>
 Reached at home, Rose said about seven people were laid off in baseball 
operations, but he wasn't apprised of any specifics. 
</P>
<P>
 The Giants this fall eliminated a rookie-league team in Scottsdale, Ariz., and 
a short-season Class-A team in Clinton, Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
 Budget cuts or not, Genovese also is upset that he wasn't contacted by General 
Manager Bob Quinn or owner Peter Magowan. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I deserve a better fate than that," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Length of service apparently wasn't a factor in his release, either. "You'd 
think seniority might play a role in who's cut back," he said. "It's a shock. I 
don't know what I'm going to do. Most places you get a watch and a dinner. 
Here, I got shown the door." 
</P>
<P>
 What stings most, though, is that even after four decades, loyalty wasn't a 
two-way street. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, Genovese received many offers to join other organizations, who 
were mindful of his eye for talent. He stayed with the Giants, however, even 
when it meant a smaller paycheck. 
</P>
<P>
 Genovese said he hasn't considered legal action. He said he'd have a hard time 
suing the team that employed him for all these years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm hoping (the Giants) will realize the error of their ways," he said. 
"Maybe they'll wake up, or the fans will wake them up."

CONNORS HAS EDGE ON TOUR; TENNIS: THE CHAMPIONS TOUR WILL BEGIN TODAY AT THE 
SHERWOOD COUNTRY CLUB IN THOUSAND OAKS.

<P>
 Hands clasped above his head, Jose Luis-Clerc opened one eye and sat up 
quickly in the lounge chair. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tough life, eh?" the Argentine native said in accented English, his hands 
gesturing to the posh poolside area at the Sherwood Country Club in Thousand 
Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 It is sweet indeed for the 36-year-old and his fellow competitors on the 
Champions tennis tour, which makes the 11th and final stop of its first season 
with the Digital Champions tournament at Sherwood today through Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am. . . . born again," Clerc said, making circles in the air with his hands 
as he paused in mid-sentence. "When I stop at 27, I didn't think I'd play 
tennis again. Now, every time we play, (the stands) are full and people are 
excited, so we fight, we fight." 
</P>
<P>
 Tour point leader and co-founder Jimmy Connors has been winning most of the 
battles. Connors has an insurmountable lead in points and has won the majority 
of the tour's tournament titles, including last weekend's Coral Champions event 
at Hilton Head, S.C., with a victory over Clerc in the final. 
</P>
<P>
 The Digital event, which pays $150,000 in prize money, starts tonight at 7 
with two singles matches: Peter Fleming against Tom Gullikson, and Roscoe 
Tanner against Larry Stefanki. Scheduled to play Thursday are Connors, Bjorn 
Borg, Johan Kriek, John Lloyd, Tanner and Tim Gullikson, along with late 
additions Mansour Bahrami, an Iranian native replacing injured Guillermo Vilas, 
and Mel Purcell, who replaces Vitas Gerulaitis, who died Sept. 18 at 40. 
</P>
<P>
 The semifinals are scheduled for Saturday at 1 p.m. and 7 p.m., and the final 
for Sunday at 1 p.m.  
</P>
<P>
 The Champions tour, which includes players 35 and over, has drawn four- and 
five-day crowds of more than 20,000 at each of its stops. The five-day event at 
the 3,500-seat Sherwood stadium is expected to eclipse that mark. 
</P>
<P>
 Players understand the tour's need to attract sponsors and sell tennis to the 
public. 
</P>
<P>
 Connors is conducting a free instructional clinic for junior players beginning 
at 4 p.m. today at Sherwood. All participants will receive half-price tickets 
for tonight's session.

BOARD REQUESTS '99 SUPER BOWL AT COLISEUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors unanimously approved a letter to 
NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue requesting that the 1999 Super Bowl be held at 
the Coliseum.  
</P>
<P>
 The NFL is scheduled to vote on the site Nov. 2. 
</P>
<P>
 The letter is somewhat in response to comments made by Tagliabue recently. 
Tagliabue had suggested that the league assist Los Angeles in construction of a 
new stadium that would be a semi-regular site for the Super Bowl. Tagliabue 
later said that County officials had initiated the discussion. 
</P>
<P>
 Both comments were disputed by Supervisor Michael Antonovich, who co-authored 
the letter with Supervisor Yvonne Brathwaite Burke. 
</P>
<P>
 "Building a new stadium in Los Angeles will be unnecessary once we get a 
long-term lease with the Raiders, which will enable us to arrange for the 
financing of luxury boxes and improvements that would make the Coliseum a 
world-class facility for the 21st Century," Antonovich said in a statement. 
"Neither myself nor the other three members of the Coliseum Commission had any 
discussions with commissioner Tagliabue about building a new stadium before his 
proposal became public."

BASEBALL TALKS MIGHT RESUME ON THURSDAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSS NEWHAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Representatives of baseball's owners and players said Tuesday they are hopeful 
labor talks will resume Thursday in New York, but there has been no indication 
of a change in the owners' salary cap proposal or the players opposition to it. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one on our side is optimistic, but getting to the table, at least, would 
be an improvement," union lawyer Lauren Rich said.There have been only three 
negotiating sessions since the players went on strike Aug. 12 and none since 
Sept. 9. 
</P>
<P>
 Acting commissioner Bud Selig said there has been no change in the owners' 
proposal or position -- nor any evidence of a behind-the-scenes compromise. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, he said, "there's no way to make a deal if we don't meet." And 
he insisted that the owners have not decided whether to implement the cap if 
there is no agreement, a move the union believes is certain. 
</P>
<P>
 The owners previously asked the players for a 45-day freeze on contract 
signings, a span during which the owners would pledge not to implement a cap, 
and for a delay in Saturday's scheduled start of free agent filing to Nov. 30. 
</P>
<P>
 A union lawyer said a decision would be made Friday. ROSS NEWHAN

MISSOURI GROUP TO MEET WITH RAMS; BUSINESS: FORMER SENATOR LEADS GROUP IN 
LATEST BID TO WOO TEAM FROM ANAHEIM.

<TEXT>
<P>
 A St. Louis delegation, headed by former Missouri Sen. Thomas Eagleton, is 
scheduled to meet with the Rams in Los Angeles today to resume negotiations 
aimed at getting the team away from Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's proposal is expected to include plans for raising at least $60 
million through a permanent seat-licensing program in the new $258-million, 
70,000-seat domed stadium, which is under construction in St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
 Fans would be asked to pay a one-time fee for the right to purchase season 
tickets, a plan the expansion Carolina Panthers recently used to raise $142 
million to construct their stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Funds generated in St. Louis would be used to pay some $30 million the Rams 
still owe for Anaheim Stadium improvements made in 1980, about $15 million for 
a new practice facility and an estimated $15 million in NFL relocation fees. 
The St. Louis offer may also include moving up the completion date for the 
stadium from late October, 1995, to early September. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they're genuinely interested in the prospect (of moving)," Eagleton 
said. "I don't think this is just an exercise they're going through." 
</P>
<P>
 Eagleton also is convinced that St. Louis is in a good position to get back 
the NFL team the city lost when the Cardinals left for Tempe, Ariz., after the 
1987 season. Baltimore also has made a lucrative offer to the Rams, and an 
Orange County group has made a significant effort to keep the team. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm optimistic," Eagleton said. "I think it's between us and Anaheim. We're 
neck and neck, and we've got a lead over Baltimore." 
</P>
<P>
 Eagleton said he expects a decision after mid-November. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're not going to make an instant decision," Eagleton said. "They're going 
to take some time and they'll probably have some follow-up questions for us."

5-CAR CRASH INJURES 10; 2 O.C. STUDENTS CRITICAL; ACCIDENT: WORST HURT ARE 
TRAPPED IN WRECKAGE FOR MORE THAN AN HOUR. RESCUERS ARE AMAZED THAT EVERYONE 
SURVIVED.

 A car full of six Capistrano Valley High School students careened out of 
control Tuesday morning, collided with oncoming traffic, flew into the air and 
flipped over, trapping three of the youths inside. 
</P>
<P>
 Firefighters worked for more than an hour to extricate the pinned students, 
freeing one girl by cutting her hair. Two passing firefighters and a nurse 
headed to work managed to free the remaining teen-agers and tend to other hurt 
motorists. In all, 10 people were injured; two of the three trapped students 
are in critical condition and the other is in serious but stable condition. 
</P>
<P>
 The intersection of Marguerite Parkway and Estanciero was turned into a 
chaotic scrap heap of strewn debris and broken glass from five cars damaged in 
the crash. Veteran emergency workers expressed amazement that no one was 
killed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never seen a crash of this magnitude," said firefighter Nolan Osborn, 
who found the wheels of the overturned Toyota still spinning when he happened 
upon the scene. "Everywhere I looked, there were (wrecked) cars. I was 
stunned." 
</P>
<P>
 It was the second major South County accident in recent months involving a 
group of high school students. In late August, four El Toro High School 
cross-country runners were injured in a collision that occurred as the athletes 
were driving back to campus after a midmorning trip for fast food. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators had not determined the cause of the 7:30 a.m. Mission Viejo 
crash, but witnesses told police the car carrying the students was weaving in 
and out of traffic and appeared to be traveling at least 70 m.p.h. when it 
sideswiped another car and lost control as the six students headed to school, 
said Sheriff's Lt. Dan Martini. The speed limit at the intersection where the 
crash took place is 40 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
 "The possibility of excessive speed is being looked at," said Sheriff's Sgt. 
Fred Lisanti. Investigators also said the driver appeared to be the only person 
in the students' car with his seat belt fastened. 
</P>
<P>
 The car hurtled though the intersection before it struck a stopped Ford 
Explorer head on, Lisanti said. The impact propelled the Toyota at least three 
feet in the air and into another oncoming car before it came to rest on its 
roof in front of a fast-food restaurant. The Explorer was driven backward into 
a car halted behind it, injuring a teacher on her way to work at Mission Viejo 
High School. 
</P>
<P>
 "I looked up in my rearview mirror. All I saw was the car up in the air and 
spinning around," said Troy Marshall, a 26-year-old Lake Forest resident who 
was one of the first to reach the injured students. "It all went boom !" 
</P>
<P>
 Marshall, a water-treatment plant worker with first-aid training, was joined 
by a handful of others who took pulses and calmed wailing victims during the 
minutes before the first paramedic crew arrived. 
</P>
<P>
 Two Mission Viejo-based firefighters on their way to work wriggled into the 
crumpled Toyota to gauge the injuries of the three teens trapped inside, while 
the passing nurse tended to a woman and her 4-year-old daughter, who sustained 
minor injuries as they waited at a stoplight in the Explorer. 
</P>
<P>
 The driver of the car full of teens, 18-year-old Kenneth Wong of Mission 
Viejo, was the last to be pried from the wreckage. He was airlifted to Mission 
Hospital Regional Medical Center with injuries that included a concussion and 
broken arms and legs and is in critical condition. 
</P>
<P>
 A nurse who treated him said Tuesday afternoon that Wong was awake but had "no 
idea" how the crash occurred. "He doesn't remember," said Connie Stalcup, 
trauma coordinator at Mission. 
</P>
<P>
 Wong and two other students were hospitalized at Mission and its affiliated 
Children's Hospital. Linda Chang, 15, sustained head injuries and cuts and is 
in serious but stable condition, and Sroothi Jaikumar, 14, suffered broken 
bones and cuts and is in critical condition. 
</P>
<P>
 Three other students -- Jade Gjestland, 15; Kristi Kaewmane, 16; and Lewis 
Chow, 16, all of Mission Viejo -- were treated and released from Children's 
Hospital of Orange County in Orange. 
</P>
<P>
 Firefighters worked for more than an hour to extricate the three trapped 
students, freeing one girl by cutting her hair, which was caught in the 
wreckage. 
</P>
<P>
 The injured students included two pairs of cousins and a sophomore homecoming 
queen nominee whose parents thought she was riding to school with someone else. 
</P>
<P>
 Fearing the possibility of a car accident someday, Jaikumar's father, V. Jay 
Vadivelu, said he had scolded her two weeks ago for refusing to ride the bus. 
Vadivelu said he allowed his daughter to ride to school twice a week with a 
friend so she could take swimming lessons. But she was not in that car Tuesday, 
Vadivelu said. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the phone rang, I said, 'Damn, I knew it was going to come,' " Vadivelu 
said outside his daughter's room in the pediatric intensive care unit. 
</P>
<P>
 Four other injured motorists and their passengers were taken to Saddleback 
Memorial Medical Center in Laguna Hills with injuries that authorities said 
were not serious. Those treated and released from Saddleback were: Cathay 
Vincent, 39, and her 4-year-old daughter, Kendra, of Rancho Santa Margarita; 
Alan Speckerman, 49, of San Juan Capistrano; and Sandra Busby, 54, of Coto de 
Caza. Two other people were uninjured, authorities said.

 A Tuesday morning crash in Mission Viejo that injured 10 people occurred when 
a car carrying six Capistrano Valley High School students hit three other cars.

TUSTIN MARINE IS MISSING IN FALL OFF SHIP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A 20-year-old Tustin-based Marine bound for the Persian Gulf is missing and 
presumed drowned after falling off the deck of the helicopter carrier Tripoli 
and into the Arabian Sea, officials announced Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Cpl. Steven Mosier, 20, a helicopter technician from Arkansas who had been 
based at the Tustin Marine Corps Air Station for about a year, fell overboard 
about 9:45 p.m. Friday, Marine officials said. Divers were unable to recover 
Mosier's body in a 24-hour search of the surrounding waters. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't know exactly how he fell or anything of that nature," said Cpl. 
Christy McGill, a Tustin Marine base spokeswoman. "It's under investigation." 
</P>
<P>
 Chief Petty Officer Steve Lawson, a public affairs officer with the U.S. Naval 
Forces Central Command in Bahrain, said Mosier was apparently working on the 
rear of a CH53 Sea Stallion helicopter. Witnesses said Mosier tumbled, hit his 
head on the edge of the deck and went into the water. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawson said an immediate rescue attempt was launched and the Rushmore stayed 
in the area for 24 hours while divers searched for Mosier's body. 
</P>
<P>
 "He fell right on the edge of the landing deck," said his father, Ray Mosier, 
who was informed of his son's apparent death on Saturday at the family home in 
Wynne, Ark., about 90 miles east of Little Rock. 
</P>
<P>
 A witness, who was unable to save Mosier, said the Marine was unconscious when 
he hit the water. 
</P>
<P>
 "He sank immediately and couldn't activate his life jacket," the elder Mosier 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mosier, who enlisted in the Marines in 1992, shipped out with his Tustin unit, 
Medium Helicopter Squadron 166 in June for a routine tour of duty on the 
Tripoli. 
</P>
<P>
 "They had been at sea for about four months," the elder Mosier said. "They 
were making a cruise of the Pacific and he had been in Nairobi and the 
helicopter squadron he was assigned to had been flying food and medical 
supplies to the people in Rwanda." 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, however, President Clinton ordered the Tripoli to the Persian Gulf 
in the wake of the Iraqi troop buildup along the Kuwaiti border. 
</P>
<P>
 Steven Mosier was active in his church and was a 1992 graduate of Wynne High 
School, where he was a two-year football team starter. 
</P>
<P>
 "Steve was a very dedicated individual," said Wynne School Supt. Darrell 
Smith. 
</P>
<P>
 Football coach Don Campbell said he was "impressed with how hard he worked. I 
think the kids really looked up to him." 
</P>
<P>
 "He always wanted to be Marine," said his father, who is a World War II Army 
veteran. "He was proud of it. He went where he was told to go, he did what he 
was told to do. He was an outstanding Marine." 
</P>
<P>
 Mosier committed to joining the Marines when he was only a junior in high 
school, said Ray Mosier. The youth even turned down a four-year academic 
scholarship to a local college to enter the Marines. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was handy with computer and electronic gadgets," said Ray Mosier. "He 
thought that would be a good field to get into." 
</P>
<P>
 Steven Mosier's wife, Stefanie, returned to Arkansas this summer to study 
accounting after he shipped out in June. The couple's two-year wedding 
anniversary is today. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were high school sweethearts," said Ray Mosier. "She was the only 
girlfriend he ever really had." 
</P>
<P>
 Ray Mosier was looking forward to hunting and fishing with his son in December 
when Steven was scheduled to come home on leave. 
</P>
<P>
 "He and I were hunting and fishing companions," Mosier said. "But now he won't 
be there anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 Steven Mosier had two older sisters and an older brother. 
</P>
<P>
 "Being that he was the youngest, Steve and I spent a lot of time together when 
the other children left," added his father. "I remember when he was a little 
kid he would be watching cartoons and he'd see me with my fishing pole and he'd 
say, 'Wait a minute, Dad, let me go with you.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Services for Mosier are scheduled for 2 p.m. Thursday at the First United 
Methodist Church in Wynne.

COLUMN ONE; DAMPING THE FLAMES IN BURUNDI; ETHNIC MASSACRES COULD AGAIN ENGULF 
THE POLARIZED TUTSI AND HUTU AS THEY DID IN NEIGHBORING RWANDA. BUT A RECENT 
POWER-SHARING DEAL HAS SPURRED HOPES OF PEACE AND RECONCILIATION.

<P>
 In this land where the Nile has its uppermost headwaters, the brief, sudden 
African dusk had fallen on the rolling mountains, bathing them violet. On the 
breeze-swept veranda of his parish church and school, a Roman Catholic priest 
nursed a lukewarm beer and voiced his dread. 
</P>
<P>
 "We live in the fear of each day," he confided. "When I consider history, and 
people's hearts, I am truly afraid." 
</P>
<P>
 Just that Friday, he explained, members of Burundi's army had shot and killed 
seven people in cold blood as they traveled from Bujumbura, the capital at the 
northeastern tip of Lake Tanganyika, to the terraced slopes of Buhonga. 
</P>
<P>
 In July, he said, the parish school's manager, a professor, two cooks and a 
driver were pulled from their car on a mountain road by soldiers, and slain 
just as pointlessly. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here, to meet the army is to meet death," said the priest, whose 85,000 
parishioners eke a living from small banana plantations and subsistence 
farming. "But there is no one you can complain to about it. We are Christians, 
so we are waiting for the Last Judgment." 
</P>
<P>
 Others in this remote, landlocked wedge of Central Africa -- bedeviled by 
ethnic hatred, a colonial past and now, even by geography -- fear an 
apocalypse. In Burundi, "We are at the brink of the chasm," said Tharcisse 
Nsavymana, president of Iteka, a human rights group. 
</P>
<P>
 Recent events in Rwanda, the country immediately to the north, have given 
pessimists much to worry about. In April and May, ethnically motivated 
massacres led to the liquidation of an estimated 500,000 Rwandans -- perhaps 
twice as many as that. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since the catastrophe in Rwanda, the risk of a total conflagration in Burundi 
is on everybody's minds," Nsavymana said. "Not a day goes by without a 
murderous attack here or there." 
</P>
<P>
 But not everyone in Burundi is rushing, lemming-like, toward collective 
suicide. After protracted haggling, politicians from 10 parties last month 
signed a power-sharing agreement crafted to placate the powerful, wealthy Tutsi 
minority without renouncing the Hutu majority's democratic right to rule. 
</P>
<P>
 That pact, and the election of a consensus president in late September, may 
halt Burundi's slippery slide into ethnic war. 
</P>
<P>
 Or they may not. 
</P>
<P>
 For the single mightiest institution -- the 7,150-member Burundian army, air 
force and national police, in which Tutsis hold virtually all command posts, 
including the defense minister's portfolio -- possesses an effective right of 
veto, whatever politicians decide. 
</P>
<P>
 In October, 1993, in a still murky bid at a government takeover, renegade 
Tutsi soldiers arrested Melchior Ndadaye -- predecessor of President Cyprian 
Ntayamira, who died in an April plane crash -- and murdered him at the Muha 
army base south of the capital. 
</P>
<P>
 The attempted putsch and the assassination of Burundi's first democratically 
elected and Hutu president since independence in 1962 sparked massacres of 
Tutsis by outraged Hutus across the country. Within days, a savage campaign of 
repression was launched by Tutsi soldiers, police and groups of young 
unemployed thugs regrouped as self-styled militias. 
</P>
<P>
 At least 50,000 people, Tutsis and Hutus, perished, Amnesty International 
estimates. 
</P>
<P>
 But the outside world, absorbed by Russian President Boris N. Yeltsin's army 
assault on hard-line members of Parliament in Moscow's White House, the 
quagmire faced by the United States in Somalia and other events that autumn, 
was not paying attention. 
</P>
<P>
 That the army and the police, or gendarmerie , is still firmly in Tutsi hands 
rules out any nationwide genocide of Burundi's minority population on a 
Rwanda-like scale. But it makes any attempt at democracy-building in this 
country a ticklish, even risky endeavor, indeed. 
</P>
<P>
 "The army is untouchable; it doesn't want to hear about Hutus in the army. 
This is the principal problem in Burundi," said Emmanuel Mpfayukurera, 35, a 
Hutu elected to Parliament last year on the list fielded by the Hutu-dominated 
party that Ndadaye founded, the Front for Democracy in Burundi. 
</P>
<P>
 To understand how deep the ethnic divide has become, one must delve into the 
past of this tawny-colored, densely peopled land astride the crest dividing the 
watersheds of the Nile and the Congo. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Rwanda -- where a blood bath erupted after the Rwandan head of state, 
along with Ntayamira, Burundi's acting president, were killed in a plane hit by 
a rocket April 6 -- the ethnic mix in Burundi is 85% Hutu, 14% Tutsi and 1% 
Twa, or Pygmy. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tutsi-Hutu division -- the legacy of colonial rule and longstanding Tutsi 
economic, social and intellectual dominance -- gave this country a social order 
that Hutus like Mpfayukurera have no problem labeling "black apartheid." 
</P>
<P>
 The Twa, Burundi's diminutive, original inhabitants, were displaced starting 
in about the year 1000 by the Hutu, a stocky farming people of Bantu heritage. 
Beginning in the 16th Century, another migration occurred, that of the tall, 
pastoralist Tutsi from Ethiopia and Uganda. 
</P>
<P>
 Gradually, the Hutu became subjugated into a feudal system similar to that of 
Medieval Europe, with a loosely organized Tutsi aristocracy headed by a king. 
The Hutu relinquished their land and mortgaged their services to the Tutsi in 
return for cattle, the currency of wealth and social status. 
</P>
<P>
 The arrival of Europeans only consolidated Tutsi supremacy. Both Rwanda and 
Burundi were colonized in the 1890s by Germany. But Belgium easily defeated the 
small German detachments garrisoned here in World War I. After the war, the 
League of Nations mandated Burundi (then called Urundi) and Rwanda to Belgium. 
</P>
<P>
 The Belgians were only too happy to rule indirectly through Tutsi chiefs and 
princes, allowing them broad powers in return for tax revenue. Even Christian 
missions, granted a monopoly on education, made the ethnic differences worse. 
They virtually ignored Hutus, commonly considered dumb, if hard-working 
peasants, and concentrated on educating the "nobler" Tutsis. 
</P>
<P>
 That colonial past, and the Tutsi mastery of independent Burundi that ended 
only with the groundbreaking democratic elections of June, 1993, spawned a 
society as schizoid as the antebellum American South. Hutus make up the 
overwhelming majority of the country's 5.8 million people. Yet one Hutu 
politician has calculated that Tutsis still hold all but 13 of the 228 
judgeships. 
</P>
<P>
 In the army, Tutsi supremacy is so strong that a majority of soldiers -- 
Tutsis -- are believed to come from a single province, Bururi, home to three 
Tutsi heads of state. For decades, Tutsis also held the bulk of the 
government-issued licenses for foreign and large-scale domestic trade, making 
it easier for members of the minority to become rich. Most government 
functionaries are still Tutsis. 
</P>
<P>
 One reason for such preeminence was a longstanding policy of what Hutus term 
"intellectual genocide." Until the 1990s, they say, Hutu children used to have 
the letter u inserted before their names on school rolls, while Tutsi 
youngsters were marked with an i. When the time came to choose children for 
higher education, those with the telltale u were systematically flunked or 
shunted into vocational or technical courses. 
</P>
<P>
 "The selection in education was intentionally such that there was no Hutu 
intelligentsia," Labor Minister Venerend Bakevyumusaya says. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, only 1,000 Hutus have made it through secondary education, he 
estimates. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1972, one of Africa's fiercest ethnic wars drenched Burundi in blood after 
a large-scale Hutu revolt led to the deaths of more than 1,000 Tutsis. That 
summer, the Tutsi military junta then in power responded by hunting down and 
killing any Hutu with a formal education, a government job or a fair amount of 
money. In three months, an estimated 200,000 Hutus were butchered; tens of 
thousands more fled to Tanzania, Rwanda and Zaire. 
</P>
<P>
 In consequence, it is hard these days in Burundi to find a Hutu politician, 
Cabinet minister or other leader older than the mid-30s. 
</P>
<P>
 Africa, which mobilized on a continental scale to oppose racial discrimination 
in white-ruled South Africa, seemed largely indifferent to this black-on-black 
carnage. 
</P>
<P>
 The world's attitude then, and its general paralysis when faced with this 
spring's massacres in Rwanda, made a deep impression on Burundi's current 
leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 In the words of one Bujumbura-based diplomat, Sylvestre Ntibantunganya -- the 
38-year-old Hutu politician who succeeded Ntayamira as acting president after 
the April plane crash -- realizes with his entourage "that no foreign power is 
going to fly troops in here to save their skins. So they have to deal with the 
military and the minority." 
</P>
<P>
 That acute sense of realpolitik has led the Front for Democracy in Burundi to 
voluntarily relinquish many of the fruits of its victory in the national 
elections held in June, 1993. Though the first democratic polling in Burundi's 
history gave it 64 of the 81 seats in the National Assembly and a landslide 
presidential margin for Ndadaye, the Hutu-led party has agreed to embrace the 
former ruling Union for National Progress and other Tutsi-led parties as 
partners in government. 
</P>
<P>
 "We won the elections, but we practically have ceded power," Mpfayukurera 
said. "We're living with our head in the lion's maw, and he can close his jaws 
at any time." 
</P>
<P>
 Under the Sept. 10 power-sharing accord, the Front for Democracy ceded 45% of 
the ministerial posts to the Tutsi-led opposition. The premiership, for all 
intents and purposes, was also reserved for a Tutsi. Rival parties also agreed 
to create a seven-member state council to serve as a powerful check on the 
president. 
</P>
<P>
 Ntibantunganya, a former National Assembly chief, was confirmed Sept. 30 as 
Burundi's president by a 68-1 vote of Parliament. As expected, the acting head 
of state was nominated as the consensus candidate by a committee made up of 
representatives of the country's 13 political parties, two bishops, a 
businessman and a union leader. In the end, eight of the 13 parties endorsed 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to heal the wounds, to get people to tolerate each other, to settle 
their differences," Ntibantunganya has said. 
</P>
<P>
 The young Hutu leader knows firsthand how hurtful the country's ethnic discord 
can be. In last October's attempted coup, his wife was murdered by rebel troops 
who had come to arrest him. 
</P>
<P>
 The give-and-take that led to Burundi's power-sharing agreement and the broad 
support for Ntibantunganya's candidacy make some optimistic that ethnic 
reconciliation is well under way. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not Rwanda," U.S. Embassy spokesman Gordon Duguid observed. "It's a 
difficult situation, but the prospects for democracy are good if a majority of 
the people can resist the extremists. They're the danger to the process." 
</P>
<P>
 True, some Hutus have objected to the whole idea of power-sharing as a 
flouting of the bedrock notion of democracy, the majority's right to rule. 
Meanwhile, opposing Tutsis accuse the Front for Democracy of masterminding the 
October, 1993, massacres. Some say that as many as 200,000 Tutsis were 
slaughtered, while thousands of others fled their homes and now live in camps 
guarded by the army. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we weren't afraid, we wouldn't be in the street," said Christophe 
Hicintuka, 40, who marched recently through Bujumbura with hundreds of other 
Tutsi supporters of the hard-line Party for National Recovery, which rejected 
the power-sharing pact. 
</P>
<P>
 But most alarming is the fact that as the politicians negotiated, the killings 
in Burundi continued, and continue even now. Even as members of the Parliament 
debated Ntibantunganya's election, grenades were tossed in Bujumbura's southern 
suburbs. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are arming themselves all over the country," said former President 
Pierre Buyoya, a Tutsi whose acceptance of multi-party democracy led to his 
resounding defeat by Ndadaye's pro-Hutu party at the polls. 
</P>
<P>
 In the bazaar of the capital, one can reportedly buy a grenade these days for 
$1. Small bands of Hutu extremists are said to be operating in the countryside, 
staging hit-and-run attacks, then retreating into the dense equatorial forests. 
More than 200,000 Hutus crossed the border from Rwanda this summer after the 
civil war victory of the Tutsi-led Rwandan Patriotic Front, further adding to 
Burundi's instability. 
</P>
<P>
 Politicians, especially from the Hutu-led Front for Democracy, are in mortal 
danger. One deputy was shot and killed in August as he drove home. On Sept. 16, 
Norbert Ndihokubwayo, another Hutu member of the National Assembly, was fired 
on by two gunmen as he drove through Bujumbura. He was struck by five bullets, 
including one that pierced his jaw, but survived. 
</P>
<P>
 In Burundi's own tragic version of ethnic cleansing, Hutus and Tutsis, who 
used to intermarry often enough in the past, were chased from each other's 
neighborhoods starting last autumn. Their abandoned homes were torched and 
their possessions looted. The two peoples, who share a common culture and 
language, Kirundi, have never been more polarized. 
</P>
<P>
 But it is the army, and the politicians who have forged secret ties with it, 
who remain the X-factor, the unknown quantity, that will determine whether war 
or peace reigns. Just two days after the power-sharing formula was agreed to by 
most of Burundi's leading politicians, on Sept. 12, Tutsi soldiers circled the 
working-class Hutu neighborhood at Kamenge a few miles from Parliament's 
chambers. 
</P>
<P>
 Hutus who had armed themselves shot at the soldiers, residents admit. The army 
withdrew but returned after dawn with 10 armored cars and fired for hours on 
the flimsy shacks of dried mud where 80,000 Hutus live. The next day, the 
soldiers began house-to-house searches and manhunts. 
</P>
<P>
 By the army's count, 60 civilians and two soldiers were killed. Kamenge 
residents say 150 of their neighbors died. Many, including the district's Front 
leader, were skewered with bayonets, they say, making nonsense of the army's 
claim that it was engaged in a firefight with armed Hutu extremists.

 As pressures mount for a new strategy to ensure that this Iraq crisis is the 
last, the Clinton Administration may finally have to answer the central 
question left open by the George Bush Administration: what to do about Iraqi 
President Saddam Hussein? 
</P>
<P>
 To prevent the possibility of repetitive crises and revolving-door military 
deployments, military planners now face the complex issue of Iraq's cunning 
leader and his future. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's time to get rid of him. Even if his ability to attack Kuwait is 
eliminated, he's still a menace to the region," said Laurie Mylroie, author of 
two books on Iraq and a research fellow at the Foreign Policy Research 
Institute in Philadelphia.

 Most available mechanisms for punishment, from economic sanctions and 
political isolation to military devastation, have been tried since 1990 -- with 
marginal impact on Hussein's rule. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, Persian Gulf War allies, U.S. analysts and pivotal U.N. members 
are now debating options rejected four years ago for fear of a result even more 
ominous than Hussein's political survival: the fragmentation of Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
 High on the list of new possibilities is the creation of a zone in southern 
Iraq where Iraqi military forces would be excluded or their presence would be 
severely limited. With most of northern Kurdistan already beyond Hussein's 
control, that would effectively leave Hussein in full charge only of the 
central third of his country. 
</P>
<P>
 During Secretary of State Warren Christopher's visit to the region today, 
Kuwait will press the case for an exclusion zone as the only means of both 
constraining Hussein militarily and promoting political conditions to foster 
challenges to his rule. 
</P>
<P>
 If the southern zone was large enough and the military presence sufficiently 
limited, dissident political activity could spring up and lead to a form of 
alternative local power, as has occurred in the north. 
</P>
<P>
 "This time, the goal has to be to figure out a long-term deterrent on Saddam 
and to make him understand he faces serious punishment if he engages in 
unacceptable behavior," said Phebe Marr, Iraq specialist at Washington's 
National Defense University. Creating an exclusion zone "would certainly do 
that," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 An exclusion zone was seriously considered after the 1991 Gulf War. Former 
U.S. Ambassador Thomas R. Pickering had mobilized consensus for it at the 
United Nations. 
</P>
<P>
 But over strong objections from Pentagon officials, Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf 
vetoed the idea because of concern about the complexities of administering the 
southern border area and because he believed that it had "no military value," 
according to former Bush Administration officials. 
</P>
<P>
 There were also concerns about breaking Iraq into three pieces based on the 
major ethnic and religious groups in northern Kurdistan, the Sunni-ruled center 
and the Shiite-dominated south. Iraq's dismemberment or instability was viewed 
as a threat to all its neighbors, many of whom also have simmering ethnic or 
religious divisions. 
</P>
<P>
 The growing consensus behind a southern exclusion zone, which the United 
States is now floating at the United Nations, reflects the burden of Hussein's 
ongoing rule over the intervening period. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea of a zone is "almost a must," former Undersecretary of Defense for 
Policy Paul Wolfowitz said Tuesday. "We should not talk about the notion that 
he can comply with U.N. resolutions and then get his power back," Wolfowitz 
said. "As long as people think he has a future, he may have one." 
</P>
<P>
 But even if the idea of an exclusion zone becomes policy, many issues still 
have to be decided, including the size of the area, the terms of exclusion and 
the means of enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
 In terms of size, the largest area under consideration begins at the 32nd 
Parallel and would include several Iraqi cities such as Basra and Najaf, as 
well as vital oil-producing areas. The smallest area would be the largely 
barren desert area just north of Kuwait's border, U.S. analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
 The toughest terms of exclusion could ban all troops and materiel, while the 
mildest ban would be of tanks and heavy equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 And the most effective means of monitoring and enforcing compliance would 
include several battalions of ground troops backed up by air- and sea-based 
power, while the most basic means would be the kind of air power and air and 
satellite intelligence now used to monitor and protect the northern havens in 
Kurdistan. 
</P>
<P>
 The parameters would depend on the goal, according to Henri Barkey, a Lehigh 
University professor of international relations who has traveled extensively in 
demilitarized northern Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the goal is to protect Kuwait, then the terms are no tanks near the 
border. But if the goal is to get rid of Saddam, then the terms are no troops 
below the 32nd Parallel -- which creates a situation whereby he governs a very 
small chunk of territory and it becomes easier to overthrow him," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Keeping security forces out of the Shiite south could help create a power 
vacuum that might be filled by opposition forces, potentially including the 
U.S.-backed Iraqi National Congress, a coalition now based in Kurdistan. 
</P>
<P>
 With the backing of its Arab Persian Gulf neighbors, Kuwait will propose to 
Christopher that Iraq be barred from moving large amounts of heavy armor, 
artillery and rockets below the 32nd Parallel, Kuwait officials said. The idea 
is to expand the current "no-fly" zone in the 150-mile-long area to exclude 
heavy weaponry needed to mount an attack on Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
 As discussed in Kuwait, the United Nations would limit the armaments that Iraq 
is allowed to have in the area, perhaps prohibit certain weapons entirely and 
set a date for compliance. Any weapons found after that date would be subject 
to attack.

MTA CHIEF OUSTS HEAD OF SUBWAY CONSTRUCTION; METRO RAIL: ACTION IS AIMED AT 
REGAINING $1.6 BILLION IN FROZEN U.S. FUNDS. SEARCH FOR SUCCESSOR IS PLANNED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 In a move aimed at regaining federal funding for the Los Angeles subway, the 
chief of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority on Tuesday ousted a top 
agency executive responsible for managing the troubled construction project. 
</P>
<P>
 The removal of construction President Edward McSpedon was ordered by Franklin 
E. White, the MTA's chief executive officer. White's action came six days after 
the Clinton Administration announced suspension of $1.6 billion of future 
funding for subway expansion. The funding will be unfrozen, federal officials 
said, when the MTA demonstrates that it can competently manage subway 
construction. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe a change of leadership and a different management approach is what 
is needed at this time in our Metro Rail construction program," said White, 
adding that an interim replacement will be named as early as today. A 
nationwide search will be conducted for a permanent successor. 
</P>
<P>
 A majority of MTA board members appeared ready Tuesday to support one of 
White's central proposals, to dissolve the subsidiary that oversees 
construction, called the Rail Construction Corp. White first sought the 
dissolution last May and again last month. But the board -- again at the 
request of Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan -- postponed acting on the matter 
until at least the end of the month. Riordan is vacationing in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would have liked to have it considered today," county Supervisor and MTA 
Chairman Ed Edelman told reporters, adding: "The mayor asked . . . for the 
opportunity to be here when it is discussed." 
</P>
<P>
 Rae James, Riordan's transportation aide, said the mayor was briefed Tuesday 
by phone regarding developments at the MTA and backed White's prerogative to 
remove McSpedon. The mayor has not taken a position on dissolving the RCC. 
</P>
<P>
 White did not criticize any specific decision by McSpedon, saying only that 
the MTA's management of rail construction needs new direction. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to make it clear that Ed McSpedon has done outstanding work," White 
said at a news conference. He said he notified McSpedon of his decision late 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Reached at home, McSpedon said Tuesday night, "Working on this great project 
has been a labor of love for me. I sincerely hope that the MTA's action will 
benefit the delivery of transportation services to the citizens of our county." 
</P>
<P>
 Within the last 14 months, controversy has built over the quality of the 
construction of the subway, the most expensive per mile in U.S. history. 
</P>
<P>
 The existence of concrete that was thinner than originally required in tunnels 
Downtown was reported in August, 1993, by The Times and repairs have been under 
way for the last seven months. A chief subway inspector also told specialists 
hired to examine the matter that necessary patches were not made to a damaged 
plastic liner designed to keep explosive and toxic gases out of the tunnels. 
</P>
<P>
 The structures now open to passenger service mostly were completed before 
McSpedon took control in mid-1990. But more recently, decisions by McSpedon's 
staff and MTA consultants regarding tunneling and incidents of ground sinking 
up to nine inches along Hollywood Boulevard have come under fire. 
</P>
<P>
 Excavation there has been halted since Aug. 18 and workers were evacuated two 
days later when the contractor feared that one of the twin tunnels could 
collapse. 
</P>
<P>
 White reiterated Tuesday that he would await agreements from both the city of 
Los Angeles and federal transit officials before authorizing a resumption of 
the tunneling. The MTA will submit its plan for how to resume the construction 
to city and federal officials by Monday, White said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I absolutely expect the Federal Transit Administration and the engineers 
employed by the City Council to reach agreement with us on that," White said. 
He did not speculate on when federal officials might agree to lift the 
suspension of funding for extending the subway to the San Fernando Valley, East 
Los Angeles and elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 In announcing McSpedon's removal and other changes, White said he is seeking 
tighter control over construction quality and the supervision of the 
multibillion-dollar work. The federal government has contributed about half of 
the funding, by far the greatest share, for the Los Angeles subway project. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal authorities, including the FBI and the inspector general of the 
federal Department of Transportation, have been investigating aspects of the 
earlier subway construction. 
</P>
<P>
 White said that it has yet to be resolved whether McSpedon, who had overseen 
building of the Downtown subway and other Metro Rail lines since 1990, would 
remain at the MTA in a different capacity. He had defended his performance in 
recent days and said that he wanted to retain his position. 
</P>
<P>
 White announced other steps in response to the construction problems: 
</P>
<P>
 * The inspection-management firm of Parsons-Dillingham would be "phased out" 
of its role in supervising extension of the subway to Universal City and North 
Hollywood, White said, if he wins approval of the MTA board. 
</P>
<P>
 Parsons-Dillingham, whose inspections and overall management of the first 4.4 
miles of the subway were found below "acceptable industry practice" by an 
independent report prepared for the MTA in March, has a contract to oversee 
some of the future work. Representatives of the firm, who last week accused the 
builder of the Hollywood subway tunnels of deliberately concealing defective 
work from inspectors, defended their performance. 
</P>
<P>
 "Parsons-Dillingham . . . has performed its construction management function 
in a competent and professional manner," said spokesman Ron Wildermuth, adding 
that the firm believes that an unreleased study will show that the firm's more 
recent work "meets or exceeds industry standards." 
</P>
<P>
 * The MTA will request that the tunnel contractor, the joint venture of 
Shea-Kiewit-Kenny, "restructure its management team" to complete the ongoing 
work along Hollywood Boulevard and Vermont Avenue. A Shea-Kiewit-Kenny 
spokeswoman said Tuesday that the firm would have no comment. 
</P>
<P>
 * The MTA will seek reimbursement from design, construction and management 
consultants for "all costs associated" with the sinking along Hollywood 
Boulevard. The cost of repairing the tunnels, themselves damaged by the 
sinking, has not been determined. 
</P>
<P>
 * The MTA will decide whether to terminate any of the firms working on the 
Hollywood tunnels, based on how much it would cost to replace them and the 
extent to which the companies are found responsible for causing the sinkages. 
</P>
<P>
 White said a decision regarding any termination will follow a more detailed 
assessment of why Shea-Kiewit-Kenny was allowed to use wood wedges, instead of 
metal struts, for bracing and whether the materials used were installed 
properly. The substitution of the wedges was approved by engineers of 
Parsons-Dillingham and the MTA's design consultants, led by the firm of Parsons 
Brinckerhoff. 
</P>
<P>
 White's ouster of McSpedon drew mixed reaction. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles City Councilman Richard Alatorre called the removal a "sad 
commentary." 
</P>
<P>
 "Why should he be the fall guy?" Alatorre said in an interview. "How does that 
improve our chance of getting back our (federal) money?" Alatorre said that 
neither dissolving the RCC nor firing people is necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 City Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, Riordan's alternate on the MTA board, said 
that McSpedon's removal, alone, is not sufficient to change the agency's 
course. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole culture that has grown around the RCC, which has created a very 
cozy relationship between RCC board members, staff and contractors and 
subcontractors (and) management consultants, has to be broken up," Yaroslavsky 
said. "(The MTA) has to be less cozy and more adversarial in the interest of 
the taxpayers." 
</P>
<P>
 County Supervisor Gloria Molina chided fellow MTA board members for not 
dissolving the RCC and giving White authority "to increase control over and 
demand accountability from the (MTA's) construction managers and general 
contractors. . . . A needless bureaucratic layer exists." She said the federal 
government had withdrawn funding "after countless construction deficiencies." 
</P>
<P>
 Another board member, Nick Patsaouras, urged White to take more sweeping 
action. "You say we cannot fire Shea-Kiewit-Kenny. Why not? . . . You're 
talking about restoring credibility. . . . Yes, maybe it costs us money." 
</P>
<P>
 Of McSpedon's firing, Patsaouras said, "It's not enough. He's only part of the 
problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Robert E. Kruse, an RCC board member who has worked closely with McSpedon, 
defended his colleague. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ed is one of the finest construction managers in the country," said Kruse, an 
equipment-leasing contractor. "Using him as a sacrificial lamb is not the 
solution to the problems. . . . It serves political purposes, but it doesn't 
support the (construction) program." 
</P>
<P>
 McSpedon began working for the now-defunct Los Angeles County Transportation 
Commission in 1985 as a civil engineer. McSpedon -- whose annual salary is 
$131,833 -- defended his record last week, saying that no project of the 
subway's complexity could be built without problems. He said that he had made 
his job "virtually an all-consuming passion for 10 years." 
</P>
<P>
 "In the 10 years I've been here, we have put more operating rail miles in 
place than any other city in the U.S.," he said in an interview, referring to 
the Downtown subway and the 22-mile Long Beach-Los Angeles Blue Line trolley. 
"I would hope that I would enjoy the confidence of the policy makers on the 
basis of what we've accomplished and what we have under way and not based on an 
incident or two or a problem or two, because those kinds of things are 
unavoidable when trying to do something as big or as important as this."

THE MYSTIC BEHIND WILSON'S MYSTIQUE; POLITICS: ADVISER MET WITH GURU BEFORE 
AGREEING TO RUN REELECTION BID. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY WALLACE, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 George Gorton, who is managing Gov. Pete Wilson's reelection campaign, doesn't 
worry about the future. 
</P>
<P>
 The 47-year-old political consultant's state of calm is partly a result of 
recent poll numbers that show Wilson ahead of his challenger, state Treasurer 
Kathleen Brown. But truth be known, Gorton says, he hasn't really worried since 
1985, when he hooked up with an Asian monk called Buddhadassa, learned to 
meditate and succeeded, for the first time, in silencing his mind. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, that's right. Wilson's most trusted campaign adviser -- the man who has 
repeatedly sought to discredit Brown this year by linking her to the "Moonbeam" 
reputation of her brother Jerry Brown -- has a mantra. And if not for advice he 
sought from a Tibetan guru known as the 47th Reincarnation of the Precious 
Destroyer of Illusions, Gorton says he might not be running Wilson's reelection 
bid at all. 
</P>
<P>
 The revelation is surprising coming from a man who is described by those who 
know him as one of the most driven, go-for-the-jugular consultants in 
California politics. Many say that he is responsible for some of Wilson's 
harshest campaign rhetoric and that he is willing to do virtually whatever it 
takes to win. After 24 years in politics, the bearded, twice-divorced 
Republican has a tough-guy image -- not a mystical one. 
</P>
<P>
 But Gorton, whose early career was tarnished by Watergate, says he is 
misunderstood. To hear him tell it, he is on a search for truth -- a search 
that in December, 1992, led him to the Che Waung monastery in Nepal to meet the 
Tibetan wise man. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was asking him about whether or not I should do this campaign. I said, 'I'm 
very torn,' " Gorton said, recalling how the guru threw the moe -- a 
fortune-telling ritual -- three times before giving his answer. Then, through 
an interpreter, he told Gorton: "It doesn't matter what you do because your 
life is going to change dramatically in two years anyway." 
</P>
<P>
 Sitting in his office, where a large photo of his four-year-old son, A.J., and 
a framed batik of Siddhartha hang on the wall, Gorton said he is readying 
himself for the prophesy to come true this December. He has sold Direct 
Communication, the successful telemarketing firm that helped make him a 
millionaire. And win or lose, after the Nov. 8 election he is considering 
chucking politics altogether. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to be open to anything," he said. "It's not that I don't like what I 
do. I do. But it is sort of a warrior's profession. And I'm heading into a 
period in my life where I may want to be . . . more of a healer than a 
warrior." 
</P>
<P>
 Gorton's thoughts of quitting come precisely as his talents are being widely 
recognized. This campaign has been grueling. In May, 1993, the incumbent was 23 
points behind. A recent Times poll put Wilson nine points ahead, and even 
Democrats say Gorton deserves credit for deciding on a campaign message and 
sticking to it. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the things that consultants for incumbents often forget is that you 
have the ability to integrate into your campaign what's happening in 
government," said Bill Cavala, a consultant to Assembly Speaker Willie Brown 
(D-San Francisco). "George made sure (to do that). . . . Last month, every day 
(Wilson) signed a little package of legislation, that shows the governor is on 
top of something. . . . It's a good campaign. It's focused. I've seen few do it 
as well." 
</P>
<P>
 Gorton's relationship with Wilson is unusually close and, as a result, the 
role he plays in the campaign is unlike that of many political consultants. 
Part of that is a result of how long they've known each other. Gorton has 
played key roles in Wilson's five statewide campaigns and was manager of three. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown hired her current campaign chairman, Clint Reilly, just seven months 
ago. The contrasts don't end there. Reilly's style is to be in control of 
everything: His firm not only presides over campaign strategy but also produces 
the television commercials and designs Brown's campaign mailers. 
</P>
<P>
 Gorton has a more modest role and a gentler touch. The rhetoric of Wilson's 
campaign may be harsh at times, but Gorton-the-manager resembles less a 
dictator than a chairman of the board. Some say his greatest talent is 
encouraging fruitful debate. And he does it for $20,000 a month (Reilly's firm 
will make at least $1 million from the race). 
</P>
<P>
 Larry Thomas, a longtime Wilson adviser who is senior counsel to the 1994 
campaign, calls Gorton "a person who prefers consensus to giving orders." 
Sometimes, Gorton -- who has been known to spend months trekking in the 
Himalayas and who once, years ago, experimented briefly with Scientology -- 
will use his unconventional experiences to try to draw out his staff. 
</P>
<P>
 "He might say in a meeting, 'This is something I learned in est training,' " 
Don Sipple, Wilson's media consultant, said with a laugh. "This is not a guy 
who has incense burning in his house and has a Nehru jacket on and then slips 
into a Brooks Brothers suit and Hermes tie to come to work. This is not a dual 
life. It is one." 
</P>
<P>
 To understand Gorton is to understand Wilson's cohesive team of advisers -- 
and the loss they suffered in 1991. In June of that year, Otto Bos, Wilson's 
47-year-old director of communications, died suddenly of a heart attack. A 
Wilson confidant for 14 years, Bos also was a perfect partner for Gorton -- 
smooth when Gorton was blunt, deliberative when Gorton was decisive. 
</P>
<P>
 They had worked together since 1982, when Gorton managed Wilson's bid for the 
U.S. Senate and Bos was press secretary. By Wilson's 1990 campaign for governor 
-- their third race together -- "(George) and Otto were larger than the sum of 
their parts," Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
 The sudden death of Bos tore a ragged hole in Wilson's inner circle, which 
also includes Chief of Staff Bob White and pollster Richard Dresner. 
</P>
<P>
 "But with Otto's death, George emerged," said Stuart K. Spencer, a veteran 
Republican political consultant. "In terms of the Wilson operation, George had 
maybe been Otto's equal, but he had not been No. 1. No doubt in my mind that 
George is now No. 1." 
</P>
<P>
 Not everyone thinks that is a good thing. One Republican consultant said that 
"without Otto Bos, there's very few people to restrain George." (Though this 
person added, "His handling of Kathleen Brown has been masterful.") 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Scott, a corporate and political consultant who has worked in several 
nonpartisan campaigns, blamed Gorton for what he calls Wilson's "shrill" 
discussion of Proposition 187, the ballot measure that seeks to deny state 
benefits such as public schooling and non-emergency health care to illegal 
immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Gorton) appeals to the attack dog part of Pete," Scott said. Without Gorton, 
he added, "I don't think (Wilson) would have been so shrill on Proposition 187, 
blowing past the reality and using it to scapegoat immigrants." 
</P>
<P>
 But Gorton's admirers say he is only doing what it takes to win. 
</P>
<P>
 "The conventional wisdom would be: 'You're the incumbent. You defend. We'll 
throw the spears, you catch them,' " said Bill Lowery, a Washington lobbyist, 
former San Diego congressman and one of Gorton's best friends. "Guess what? 
George Gorton doesn't buy off on that simplistic paradigm. Neither does Pete. . 
. . Did (the campaign) get a little shrill at times? Yes. But it wasn't their 
choice. They're not going to lay back and let Pete be defined by an opponent or 
the media. That's what winners are all about." 
</P>
<P>
 Gorton's political involvement began in the 1960s, when he was president of 
the Aztec College Republicans at San Diego State University. After a brief 
stint as a high school math teacher, he worked as youth director for New York 
conservative James Buckley's winning U.S. Senate campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Gorton came back to San Diego to do the same youth mobilization work for a 
state assemblyman who was about to run for mayor: Wilson. Then, President 
Richard M. Nixon came calling. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was the first year that 18-year-olds had the vote, and (Nixon) was very 
concerned about it," said Gorton, recalling how Nixon's deputy campaign 
manager, Jeb Magruder, flew to San Diego to recruit him to be national college 
director for the Committee to Reelect the President, commonly known as CREEP. 
"I said, 'You're kidding. I'm just a kid from San Diego.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Soon, the kid from San Diego was getting his picture taken in the Oval Office 
(today, the photo hangs in a frame on his office wall). But Watergate was about 
to break, and so was Gorton's fledgling career. 
</P>
<P>
 Gorton had hired a college student named Ted Brill to spy on a group of 
Quakers conducting a peace vigil outside the White House. Gorton says he paid 
Brill with a personal check because Magruder told him Brill's life would be 
threatened if he were named in campaign finance reports. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Woodward, the reporter for the Washington Post, found out about Brill, who 
reportedly said he had been told to set up the Quakers for a drug arrest -- a 
contention Gorton denies. According to Woodward, Brill also suggested that he 
was not the only paid spy -- an allegation that led to a Post editorial that 
decried the Republicans' "kiddie spy corps." 
</P>
<P>
 Then, as now, Gorton said there was no band of spies. Gorton was never tried 
or convicted of any Watergate offense, and he says the only impropriety 
involved his payments to Brill. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a campaign reporting violation, which wasn't my fault. And it wasn't a 
big deal -- we didn't get fined for it," he said. Still, Gorton was fired. And 
things would only get worse. 
</P>
<P>
 As Gorton was looking for work, he gave out the phone number of a friend at 
Republican Party headquarters to ensure he didn't miss prospective employers' 
calls. That led to more news stories that said the Republican National 
Committee was helping find jobs for people implicated in Watergate. And that 
prompted then-Republican Party Chairman George Bush to call a news conference 
to banish Gorton from the party headquarters and bar him from working again in 
Republican campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a miserable time. I certainly realized that (while) I was terribly 
loyal . . . no one was loyal to me," Gorton says today. "But Watergate did a 
real interesting thing for me. It made me realize that I was responsible for my 
own life -- how I live it, what I put into it, what I get out of it." 
</P>
<P>
 At age 26, he returned to San Diego believing he would never work in politics 
again. He earned minimum wage at a bank. He gave tours of the city. He even 
promoted a friend's record album, trying to convince radio stations to play 
"The Mike Curb Congregation Sings Winnie the Pooh." (Curb would later become 
lieutenant governor). 
</P>
<P>
 But soon, Gorton was back, first as assistant finance director for the state 
Republican Party, then as finance director and then as an independent 
consultant. And he kept in close touch with Wilson, working on his unsuccessful 
bid for governor in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
 The first campaign Gorton actually managed was Lowery's bid for Congress in 
1980. "We were down 34 points in February and ended up winning by 10 -- that's 
pretty Herculean," recalls Lowery, who said that even then, Gorton had a tactic 
he still employs today: "Marshal the resources till the end and make them 
count. George is a stickler for that." 
</P>
<P>
 He has certainly followed that strategy in the 1994 race. During the summer, 
when Brown was hammering Wilson with several ads about California's failing 
economy, Gorton did not match her blow for blow. It would have been a waste, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Many believe the 1994 election is a turning point for Gorton. Particularly if 
Wilson is reelected, they say, Gorton's talents will probably be much in demand 
among Republicans who seek the presidency in 1996. The question is: After so 
many years in Wilson's circle, does Gorton truly want to work for anyone else? 
</P>
<P>
 "He is going to have to make a decision after this campaign," said Spencer, 
the political consultant. "If Pete Wilson decides to run for the presidency, 
George has got a horse there. But if Pete decides, 'I'm gonna stay as 
governor,' George is going to have to decide: 'Am I going to make the next step 
and find another candidate?' " 
</P>
<P>
 "There are any number of presidential campaigns that would be tickled to have 
George on their team," said Sipple, the media consultant. "But there would be a 
using dimension of that, and it would get away from the family dimension (of 
the Wilson operation). My hunch is that's what George is all about. He is not a 
mercenary." 
</P>
<P>
 After the election, Gorton plans to take a good long rest. For starters, he 
will travel to Asia and Africa. After that, he's not so sure. 
</P>
<P>
 Lowery, the lobbyist, says Gorton "is at a fork in the road. One path could be 
the predictable: to be involved in '96 (presidential politics) in a key way. 
The second path would be to find a new challenge. I don't know which one he's 
going to take. I don't think he knows."

U.S. SEES SIGNS OF IRAQ PULLBACK, SAYS CRISIS IS NOT OVER; MIDEAST: CLINTON 
EXPRESSES OPTIMISM, BUT OFFICIALS NOTE THAT THE DESTINATION OF HUSSEIN'S 
SOLDIERS IS NOT YET CLEAR. THE PENTAGON PUTS 155,000 MORE TROOPS ON ALERT.

 Iraq began withdrawing some of its forces from the Kuwaiti border area Tuesday 
in response to the U.S. military buildup. But the Pentagon placed 155,000 more 
U.S. ground troops on alert in case additional force is needed to meet the 
Iraqi threat. 
</P>
<P>
 After a day of uncertainty about Iraq's response, U.S. officials said that 
intelligence reports had shown signs of "broad movement" by most of the 80,000 
Iraqi troops in the border area, with many units loading their equipment onto 
railroad cars for shipment out of the area. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton expressed guarded optimism that Iraq was pulling back from 
the brink of a military showdown. "I'm hopeful," he told reporters at an 
impromptu news conference. "It's a little early yet to reach a final 
conclusion. We're watching it very closely." 
</P>
<P>
 But Gen. John M. Shalikashvili, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, 
cautioned that, despite the encouraging signs, there was no indication yet just 
where the Iraqi troops would be going. He said that Washington will continue to 
treat the situation as potentially dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not at all prepared to say the crisis is over in any way," he told 
reporters at the Pentagon later. 
</P>
<P>
 Shalikashvili also disclosed that 113,000 soldiers and 42,000 Marines will be 
placed on alert for possible deployment to the area. Those are in addition to 
the 36,145 U.S. ground troops already being sent to the Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
 He said that the option to send additional troops is needed to ensure that 
U.S. commanders will have enough ground troops not only to deter an Iraqi 
attack but to push the Iraqi army back if it does not move on its own. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials said Clinton also is considering a proposal to call up some 
National Guard and reserve troops. Precise figures were not available Tuesday, 
but authorities said the bulk of any call-up likely would be combat support 
units. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration also began exploring the possibility of creating a large 
exclusion zone on the Iraqi side of the Kuwaiti border and prohibiting Iraq 
from sending certain kinds of troops and equipment into the area. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration also reportedly is considering a preemptive strike against 
the Iraqi troops, policy-makers said. However, senior U.S. officials said that 
such action is unlikely unless Iraq appears to reposition itself to invade 
Kuwait, because the Administration does not want Iraq to invade Kuwait to save 
face. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the next several hours, we're going to watch and see what Iraq is going 
to do," one official said. "Meanwhile, we are getting ourselves prepared in 
case the worst comes to pass." 
</P>
<P>
 Strategists said that, even if Iraq withdraws its troops, Washington still 
might keep large numbers of aircraft and ground troops in the area to make sure 
that Iraqi troops do not push south again. 
</P>
<P>
 Pentagon officials said that the 155,000 ground troops placed on alert will 
include units of the 101st Airborne Division at Ft. Campbell, Ky., and the 1st 
Air Cavalry Division of Ft. Hood, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
 Two other units, the 24th Mechanized Infantry Division of Ft. Stewart, Ga., 
and the 1st Marine Expeditionary Force of Camp Pendleton, already are poised 
for deployment. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, Clinton ordered an additional 350 combat aircraft to the Persian 
Gulf region and decided to continue plans to place about 36,000 ground troops 
in the area by the end of the week. 
</P>
<P>
 Administration strategists began preliminary consultations on the 
exclusion-zone plan with U.S. allies at the United Nations on Tuesday. And 
officials said that Madeleine Albright, the U.S. ambassador to the United 
Nations, is expected to brief the Security Council today. 
</P>
<P>
 For all the statements by Administration officials, there still were other 
major questions unanswered on Tuesday, including how far back the United States 
would insist that Iraqi troops withdraw. 
</P>
<P>
 Administration officials are considering asking U.S. allies in Europe, Asia 
and the Persian Gulf for financial support for the current deployment, which is 
expected to cost billions of dollars even if a shooting war is averted. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1991 Persian Gulf War, which cost an estimated $70 billion, was financed 
by donations from Saudi Arabia, Japan, the Gulf states and dozens of other 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
 Secretary of State Warren Christopher is expected to raise the subject of 
money when he meets today in Kuwait City with the foreign ministers of the six 
oil-rich nations of the Gulf Cooperation Council. But officials said that 
Washington still has not begun soliciting donations. 
</P>
<P>
 Separately, the Pentagon announced that Defense Secretary William J. Perry 
will leave for the Middle East today to confer with leaders in Kuwait, Saudi 
Arabia and Egypt. He then will continue on a previously scheduled visit to 
Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to U.S. efforts, Britain announced Tuesday that it is deploying 
800 more marine commandos to the area and sending six more Tornado warplanes to 
Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
 And Russian President Boris N. Yeltsin sent two diplomats to Iraq and Kuwait 
to try to defuse the crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 Russia has been pressing the U.N. Security Council to ease the sanctions 
against Iraq because it wants to resume more normal commercial relations with 
Baghdad. 
</P>
<P>
 But a White House official said Yeltsin and Clinton agreed that Hussein's 
provocation must be met firmly and that talk of lifting sanctions must await 
full compliance with U.N. guidelines. "We think they're going to be helpful on 
this," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, at the United Nations, Iraq suffered another setback in the 
Security Council on Tuesday as the head of the commission charged with ensuring 
that Iraq eliminates its weapons of mass destruction urged that the United 
Nations not lift its economic sanctions on Iraq immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 Rolf Ekeus, the Swedish diplomat who chairs the commission, said that while 
Baghdad had been cooperative in helping his panel establish procedures for 
monitoring and verifying the weapons destruction, it is unclear how the Iraqis 
will react once the system is in operation. 
</P>
<P>
 Iraq has been pressing the Security Council to lift the sanctions but has run 
into opposition from the United States and Britain, which say it still is not 
complying with that and other demands that the allies made after the Gulf War. 
</P>
<P>
 The council is expected to take up the sanctions issue again a month from now. 
Most analysts believe that Baghdad's recent provocation near the Kuwaiti border 
is likely to dash any prospects that the U.N. body will grant Iraq any relief. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no doubt in my mind that (Iraqi President) Saddam Hussein blew it 
big at the U.N.," Albright told NBC-TV's "Today" show Tuesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 Times staff writer John M. Broder contributed to this report. A Swifter

 By storing supplies in or near the Middle East, the United States has saved 
weeks of loading and shipping time. "That's the kind of inherent flexibility in 
a heavy division that is new to us," says Lt. Gen. Paul E. Blackwell, deputy 
chief of the Army for operations. 
</P>
<P>
 The first wave of 80,000 Iraqis stopped just north of the Kuwaiti border. 
Officials claimed Monday that the force would move north to Basra. But 
skeptical U.S. officials are continuing to build up troops. 
</P>

ITO MAY PENALIZE SIMPSON PROSECUTORS OVER DNA TESTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM NEWTON and ANDREA FORD, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Trading sarcastic and sometimes caustic barbs, prosecutors and defense 
attorneys accused each other Tuesday of manipulating the issue of scientific 
tests in the O.J. Simpson murder case in order to secure tactical advantages, 
and the judge threatened to exclude some DNA results if it turns out that 
prosecutors delayed testing. 
</P>
<P>
 Barry C. Scheck, the defense team's principal DNA legal expert, asked Superior 
Court Judge Lance A. Ito to punish prosecutors for allegedly stalling so that a 
complete set of final DNA test results would not be available to the defense 
when a key hearing on DNA evidence begins later this month or in early 
November. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was tactical," Scheck said. "We believe this was a purposeful effort." 
</P>
<P>
 Lisa Kahn, the prosecution's chief DNA advocate, replied that defense 
attorneys were deluging Ito with frivolous requests "designed essentially to 
confuse and mislead the court." 
</P>
<P>
 The only tactical maneuvering, Kahn said, was by defense lawyers trying to 
disrupt the prosecution's right to test its own evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 Ito took the defense argument seriously, however, and said he would rule 
Friday on whether to exclude some test results. "If there is a purposeful 
delay, there ought to be a sanction, and the sanction will probably be denial 
of admissibility of this evidence," Ito said. 
</P>
<P>
 That threat carries significant danger for the prosecution: If Ito rules in 
favor of the defense, prosecutors could lose the right to introduce some blood 
samples that have been subjected to DNA tests -- including tests that are being 
conducted on a bloody glove found outside Simpson's Brentwood home. 
</P>
<P>
 The DNA tests are considered a mainstay of the prosecution effort, as 
authorities hope to use them to show that Simpson was at the scene of the crime 
and that he was cut in a struggle with Ronald Lyle Goldman. Goldman and Nicole 
Brown Simpson were killed June 12, and Simpson has pleaded not guilty to the 
double homicide. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than excluding any test results outright, however, Ito could decide to 
impose a deadline for test results. Defense attorneys asked him to disallow any 
results obtained after Oct. 21, and Ito mused about imposing a deadline to 
coincide with opening statements in the trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Those statements are not expected until mid-November at the earliest. By then, 
prosecutors hope to have all their tests completed, so imposing a cutoff then 
might do little damage to their case. 
</P>
<P>
 During Tuesday's hearing, Ito was clearly bothered that some blood samples 
were not forwarded to the DNA labs until mid-September, months after the 
investigation began. Based on that evidence, he said the defense had made a 
prima facie case that there had been a delay in testing, and Kahn struggled to 
explain the reasons that prosecutors had not moved more quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 Ito granted defense requests for access to some of the records Simpson's 
lawyers had sought regarding other work by the labs involved in the case. In 
general, Ito has turned down defense motions, and at one point Scheck appeared 
surprised that the judge was ruling in his favor. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to direct that it be produced," Ito said of the defense request for 
information about the DNA labs. "So you won that one." 
</P>
<P>
 From the opening days of the Simpson investigation, it has been clear that DNA 
tests would form an important element of the prosecution case. How many of 
those test results will be allowed into evidence will be decided largely by an 
upcoming hearing, and as that session draws closer, the two sides have become 
increasingly contentious. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, the acerbic confrontation between Kahn and Scheck pitted two 
experienced and sharp-tongued DNA experts in a spirited, sometimes personal 
conflict. Both vigorously argued their cases, making no secret of their 
contempt for one another: There was eye-rolling and interrupting on both sides. 
</P>
<P>
 When Kahn accused Scheck of filing requests intentionally designed to keep 
busy lab technicians from completing their work, Scheck stood next to her, 
shrugging his shoulders, shaking his head and holding up his hands in 
amazement. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, when Scheck suggested that a state Department of Justice laboratory was 
conducting a kind of DNA analysis known as RFLP, Ito said he had not heard of 
any such tests being conducted there, and Kahn enthusiastically agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe Mr. Scheck has some new information he can share with us," she said, 
grinning and staring at her counterpart. 
</P>
<P>
 The spat peaked after Kahn accused Scheck and his legal partner of trying to 
do their own evaluation of scientific work. Scheck denied that and added that 
Kahn was continually mispronouncing his name. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm awfully tired of the personality battle that's going on here," Ito said 
in exasperation. "It doesn't help me. . . . It annoys me." 
</P>
<P>
 Ito did not rule on the request for sanctions on the DNA issue, but said he 
expected to take that up again Friday, when he has scheduled hearings on 
several other matters. Among them is a defense motion asking for a special 
hearing on the "source and purpose" of leaks to the media regarding evidence in 
the Simpson case. 
</P>
<P>
 In their motion, primarily drafted by attorney Alan Dershowitz and filed under 
seal, Simpson's lawyers state that "false, distorted and misleading information 
has repeatedly been leaked to the media by members or agents of the 
police-prosecution team" and that the release of that information "constitutes 
a flagrant violation of the defendant's state and federal constitutional rights 
to due process." 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson's lawyers also suggest that police might have gone beyond merely 
leaking information, and could have manufactured evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 "The motive for leaking false information is the same as the motive for 
deliberately manufacturing false evidence -- to help convict O.J. Simpson of 
crimes the police believe he is guilty of," the motion states. "Indeed, now 
that the police have been criticized for leaking false information, they have 
an enhanced motive to make that false information turn out to be true." 
</P>
<P>
 Robert L. Shapiro, one of Simpson's lead attorneys, submitted a declaration 
along with that motion citing three news reports that he accused police or 
prosecution officials of supplying. According to defense attorneys, two reports 
were incorrect -- one that aired on KNBC stating that blood from a sock in 
Simpson's room had been genetically matched to Nicole Simpson, and a second 
that ran in Newsday asserting that DNA tests of a carpet from O.J. Simpson's 
Ford Bronco showed his ex-wife as the source of that blood. 
</P>
<P>
 Shapiro also cited a third story, from The Times, stating that DNA test 
results of at least two blood drops found at the scene pointed to Simpson as 
the source. Shapiro did not contest the accuracy of that report, but accused 
police and prosecutors of leaking the information to The Times. 
</P>
<P>
 If defense attorneys can establish that police officers or officials from the 
Los Angeles County district attorney's office improperly supplied information 
to reporters, one remedy might be to allow the defense additional peremptory 
challenges to be used during jury selection, the motion states. 
</P>
<P>
 Other possible remedies advocated by Simpson's lawyers range from excluding 
leaked evidence to giving jurors specific cautionary instructions to outright 
dismissal of the charges against their client. 
</P>
<P>
 Jury selection in the celebrated trial will resume today as the first panel of 
prospective jurors returns to Ito's courtroom to be questioned about their 
knowledge of the case and their ability to serve impartially. 
</P>
<P>
 That process is expected to be a grueling one that could last several weeks. 
At the request of news organizations, Ito has agreed to allow an audio feed 
from his courtroom to a nearby pressroom and to permit several pool reporters 
to attend the sessions. 
</P>
<P>
 But Ito has expressed concerns that media might broadcast the audio feed, 
which would violate court rules against transmitting or photographing jury 
selection. In a rare appearance in the midst of a press corps with whom he has 
feuded in recent weeks, Ito toured the press area of the Criminal Courts 
Building on Tuesday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 "The sound quality is excellent," the judge commented as a technician 
demonstrated to him how the system will work. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as he prepared to leave the room, Ito was struck lightly on the head by a 
boom microphone that was being held over his head. The judge took the accident 
in stride, smiling slightly but ignoring the questions hurled at him by the 
throng of reporters who have gathered from around the country for the trial. 
</P>

ruling on the defense request for sanctions against the prosecution based on 
alleged delays in the testing. Ito will rule on that issue Friday, and his 
decision could affect an array of items being tested to determine the source of 
bloodstains. 
</P>
<P>
 * Outside the courtroom: Ito, who has attacked much of the news coverage of 
the Simpson case, toured the press area on the 12th floor of the Criminal 
Courts Building. While there, the judge was accidentally bumped on the head by 
a microphone boom, but he shrugged off the incident good-naturedly.

TWO AMERICANS, GERMAN WIN NOBEL IN ECONOMICS; PRIZE: BERKELEY PROFESSOR AMONG 
HONOREES FOR GAME THEORY. IDEA LINKS DECISION-MAKING FROM POKER TO PRICING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN PETERSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Three economists, two Americans and a German colleague, were awarded the Nobel 
Prize Tuesday for their work on a theory that explores human behavior in 
settings ranging from a poker game to the corporate suite in an increasingly 
global marketplace. 
</P>
<P>
 The winners -- John C. Harsanyi of UC Berkeley, John F. Nash of Princeton 
University and Reinhard Selten of the University of Bonn -- are scholars of 
game theory, which applies complex logic to real-world scenarios of conflict 
and competition. These include military strategy, politics and sports in 
addition to a broad range of business problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "Eventually it will give us a higher standard of living because we make better 
decisions," Harsanyi, 74, said from his home in Berkeley, because the theory 
can lead to "better economic decisions by business and government." 
</P>
<P>
 Across the Atlantic Ocean, Harsanyi's former collaborator, Selten, 64, was 
almost apologetic about the esoteric nature of his specialty. "I have worked a 
long time in the field of mathematical economic theory, and everything to do 
with mathematics is difficult to understand for many," he told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 A key to the theory is the notion that if you can understand the strategies of 
all your rivals, you gain insight into the outcome of a situation and the 
potential benefits, economists said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike textbook economics, which is often divorced from the real world, game 
theory assumes that people get tangled up in knotty, interactive situations 
that may be filled with bluffs, second-guessing and bold gambles. Complex 
scenarios are typically spewed out of a computer in the language of 
mathematics. 
</P>
<P>
 In citing the winners, the Royal Swedish Academy said the three had employed 
strategies observed in games like chess and poker to make predictions about the 
interaction between companies. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone knows that in these games, players have to think ahead -- devise a 
strategy based on expected countermoves from the other player(s)," the judges 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 At a Princeton University press conference, Nash joked that he wished the 
$930,000 prize were bigger because it had to be divided three ways. But Nash, 
66, said he was "thrilled to receive this high honor." 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1940s, military analysts used early game theory as a tool to help guide 
U.S. ships in the perilous journey across the Atlantic Ocean. Later it was 
incorporated into Cold War thinking, such as in U.S. nuclear strategy against 
the Soviets. 
</P>
<P>
 But scholars have always appreciated the economic implications, which seem 
well suited to a world of far-flung corporations and fierce economic 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
 Increasingly since the 1970s, business strategists have built upon the 
theoretical foundations of game theory to tackle issues involving pricing, 
bidding for contracts and other strategies. 
</P>
<P>
 Airlines use it during price wars to calculate their rivals' plans and 
determine which course of action will prove most profitable. Companies may use 
it in making decisions about a new product, to boost their advantage over the 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
 The impending government auction for airwaves to be used by new 
telecommunications equipment provides a case in point. Prospective buyers for 
the coveted space on the radio spectrum are trying to figure out how much to 
bid for which portions of the spectrum and in what regions of the country. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every serious bidder in the auction is hiring a game theorist to help them 
figure out their strategy," said Carl Shapiro, a professor of business strategy 
at UC Berkeley. 
</P>
<P>
 Game theory also is transforming the way many people think about the economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Textbook economic theory "is about an isolated Robinson Crusoe-like individual 
coping with scarcity," observed Samuel Bowles, an economics professor at the 
University of Massachusetts. Game theory, by contrast, "is always about two or 
more people, and they are coping strategically with their interdependence." 
</P>
<P>
 It is a "very appropriate theory in the late 20th Century, in which the world 
of (individual) lemonade-stand capitalism increasingly is a textbook illusion." 
</P>
<P>
 The Swedish academy Tuesday singled out Princeton's Nash for refining the 
"Nash Equilibrium," a formula for understanding how people compete in 
situations where they have knowledge about each other's positions. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Nash Equilibrium has become a standard tool in almost all areas of 
economic theory in order to improve our understanding of complex strategic 
interaction," the academy said. 
</P>
<P>
 Selten, who co-authored a book with Harsanyi, built upon Nash's work and 
applied it to certain forms of economic competition, such as when there are 
only a few sellers of a particular product. 
</P>
<P>
 Harsanyi helped pave the way for the emerging field of the economics of 
information through his research into how games of incomplete information can 
be analyzed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was woken up by the telephone at 4:45 in the morning -- and I thought 
either a friend had a bad accident or they were calling to tell me about the 
Nobel Prize. Luckily it was the Nobel," said Harsanyi, a Berkeley professor 
emeritus.

 WHAT IS GAME THEORY? 
</P>
<P>
 Game theory is derived from studies of games such as poker or chess. Players 
have to think ahead and devise a strategy based on expected countermoves from 
opponents. This type of strategic interaction characterizes many situations, 
and therefore game theory has become a very useful tool for analyzing economic 
and other issues. Banks have used the theory to set monetary policies; 
politicians use it to help choose platforms to garner votes, and biologists 
have used it to help understand animal behavior.

CITY OFFICIALS LIABLE TO PAY DAMAGES, HIGH COURT RULES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 In a setback for the Los Angeles City Council in a dispute over a Sunland 
police shooting, the Supreme Court on Monday let stand a ruling that elected 
lawmakers can be forced to pay damages personally for official actions, such as 
rescuing officers from financial judgments in police brutality suits. 
</P>
<P>
 Without comment or dissent, the justices refused to hear the Los Angeles city 
attorney's argument that local lawmakers are entitled to "absolute immunity" 
from such damage suits. 
</P>
<P>
 In March, a federal appeals court in San Francisco ruled that, while 
legislators cannot be sued for passing laws, they can be held personally liable 
for decisions that are "administrative or executive in nature." The decision 
cleared the way for Los Angeles City Council members to be sued for using city 
funds to pay court damages assessed for brutality against former Police Chief 
Daryl Gates and nine police officers. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision stemmed from a 1990 incident in which a team of officers from the 
elite Special Investigations Section gunned down four robbers who had just held 
up a McDonald's restaurant in Sunland. Four relatives of the robbers sued Gates 
and the officers, contending that the police shot them without provocation. 
</P>
<P>
 The high court did not issue a written ruling endorsing the appeals court 
decision, nor has the suit against the Los Angeles council members gone to 
trial. Still, Monday's court action puts lawmakers on notice that they have to 
pay from their own pockets if their actions violate constitutional rights. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this is going to have a long-term impact on governing bodies," said 
Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, who voted for the payment and is a defendant in the 
suit. Elected officials will have to think twice before getting involved in 
volatile disputes, such as police brutality cases, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney Stephen Yagman -- who represents the plaintiffs in the Sunland suit 
and has been involved in numerous cases against the LAPD -- cheered the court's 
action. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the most significant police brutality decision ever rendered because 
it's the first one in which elected officials have been put personally at risk 
for police brutality," he said in a phone interview from New York. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the first decision that will provide a real incentive for the political 
hacks who run the city of Los Angeles to get off their butts and do something 
about the awful LAPD." 
</P>
<P>
 "They are trapped," Yagman said of the 10 Los Angeles City Council members 
facing the damage suit. "They have ratified a policy of using excessive force. 
Now the noose is around their collective neck, and it's getting tighter." 
</P>
<P>
 In the Sunland case, a jury handed down a $44,000 verdict against Gates and 
the nine officers. In reaction, the City Council voted to pay the damages for 
Gates and the officers. Yagman then filed a new suit arguing that the council's 
action amounted to condoning police brutality and asking for unspecified 
damages from the council members personally. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he was an outspoken critic of Gates, Yaroslavsky called the incident 
"a classic case where an officer should not have been asked to" pay punitive 
damages. 
</P>
<P>
 The police became involved in a shootout with armed robbers fleeing the scene 
of a crime, Yaroslavsky said. "What could have been the malice?" 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, members of the controversial SIS squad said they refrained from 
interrupting the robbery for fear of jeopardizing a manager being held hostage 
in the restaurant. Critics contend that the SIS had tracked the four robbers 
for some time, holding back to build a stronger case against them. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a tough call," Yaroslavsky said. "Do you go in and try to break it up 
and in the process, risk women and children? Or do you let them carry out the 
robbery in the hopes they won't hurt anybody? . . . It's one of the reasons I'm 
not a police officer." 
</P>
<P>
 The suit is awaiting trial. City attorneys hoped to have it dismissed in 
preliminary motions but instead have suffered a series of stunning reversals. 
</P>
<P>
 In general, the Supreme Court has said that lawmakers are entitled to 
"absolute immunity . . . in their legislative functions." But in a pair of 
rulings siding with Yagman, federal judges in California have concluded that 
lawmakers are not immune from damage claims in certain circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
 First, U. S. District Judge J. Spencer Letts in Los Angeles said that the 10 
council members who voted to shield Gates and the other officers were not 
"dealing with legislation which will affect the public at large," but rather 
were taking one side in a legal dispute over police brutality. By doing so, the 
council members could be "giving complete license for bad-faith acts" by the 
police, the judge said, and therefore they can be held liable for their 
actions. 
</P>
<P>
 In March, the U. S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, whose jurisdiction covers 
the entire West, affirmed Letts' decision and ruled that lawmakers are not 
entitled to "a cloak of absolute immunity" when they "perform an 
administrative, not a legislative, act." 
</P>
<P>
 City Atty. James K. Hahn appealed to the high court, arguing that this rule, 
if allowed to stand, could "chill" elected officials in the exercise of their 
duties. But the high court issued a one-line order Monday dismissing the 
appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyers who represent local governments said that Monday's high court decision 
will frighten elected representatives. 
</P>
<P>
 "Particularly in the small jurisdictions where you have the real 
citizen-legislators, this will have a profound impact," said attorney Timothy 
Coates, who filed a brief on behalf of city and county officials in 18 
California jurisdictions urging the high court to intervene in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 While lawyers know of no instance in which elected officials have been forced 
to pay damages, they say that there has been "an explosion of litigation" 
naming elected officials. 
</P>
<P>
 The case against the Los Angeles council members now moves to trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Donald Vincent, supervising deputy city attorney, said that he will ask Letts 
to rule that council members are entitled to "qualified immunity" from the 
damage claim on grounds that they acted in good faith and without malice. 
</P>
<P>
 But Yagman said he will present evidence showing that the council routinely 
paid huge damage claims against police officers, which should lead to a large 
damage verdict against members. If so, the council members could appeal the 
verdict to the 9th Circuit Court in San Francisco and to the U. S. Supreme 
Court.

 Savage reported from Washington and Berger reported from Los Angeles. History 
of Case That Prompted Ruling 
</P>
<P>
 Feb. 12, 1990: Four men break into a McDonald's restaurant in Sunland, forcing 
manager Robbin L. Cox to open the safe at gunpoint. Despite a 911 call from 
Cox, officers with the LAPD's Special Investigation Section, already outside 
the restaurant, decline to move in. When the robbers emerge to make their 
getaway, the officers open fire, allegedly after one of the men points a gun at 
them. Three of the men are killed and one seriously wounded in a barrage of 23 
shotgun blasts and 12 rounds fired from the officers' handguns. The robbers' 
weapons are later found to be pellet guns. The dead men are identified as 
Herbert Burgos, 27; Jesus Arango, 25, and Javier Trevino Cruz, 20. Injured was 
Alfredo Olivas, 19. 
</P>
<P>
 Feb. 21, 1990: Families of the dead and injured men file a $10-million federal 
civil-rights lawsuit against the city of Los Angeles, Mayor Tom Bradley and 
Police Chief Daryl F. Gates, alleging that excessive force was used and 
describing the mission of the SIS as that of a "death squad." 
</P>
<P>
 July 24, 1990: The lone survivor of the four robbers, Alfredo Olivas, is 
sentenced to 17 years in prison. Olivas pleaded guilty on 10 counts of robbery 
stemming from a string of holdups of fast-food restaurants, including the 
Sunland McDonald's. 
</P>
<P>
 Jan. 25, 1991: In the second lawsuit filed in the case, restaurant manager Cox 
sues the SIS officers and the city, contending that the officers should have 
stopped the four men from breaking into the restaurant or halted the robbery 
while it was in progress. 
</P>
<P>
 Jan. 9, 1992: Trial in the lawsuit brought by the robbers' families begins in 
U.S. District Court before Judge J. Spencer Letts. 
</P>
<P>
 March 30, 1992: A 10-juror panel finds in favor of the families, assessing 
$20,505 in punitive damages against Chief Gates and $23,537 against the nine 
officers involved in the shooting. Jurors say they purposely set the amount low 
because they believe the chief and his officers should be forced to pay out of 
their own pockets. Despite comments from some Los Angeles City Council members 
that Gates and the officers should pay, the council a month later decides -- 
behind closed doors -- to use city funds. 
</P>
<P>
 April 1, 1992: Stephen Yagman, the attorney representing the families, files 
another lawsuit against the City Council and police officials. The $20-million 
suit, denounced as "extortion" and a "threat" by city officials, is identical 
to the first suit but is filed on behalf of Johanna Trevino, daughter of one of 
the slain robbers, Javier Trevino. The girl was born six days after her father 
was killed. Her suit follows a legal precedent set the previous year allowing a 
child to sue for damages even though he or she was not yet born when a parent 
was killed. 
</P>
<P>
 July 20, 1992: Despite city protests that its council has "legislative 
immunity," U.S. District Court Judge Letts rules that council members must 
stand trial in the lawsuit filed on behalf of Johanna Trevino. The city appeals 
his decision. 
</P>
<P>
 Jan. 12, 1994: Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Charles W. Stoll rules 
that the city of Los Angeles is not liable for damages suffered by McDonald's 
restaurant manager Cox. 
</P>
<P>
 Feb. 28, 1994: Ruling against the city's appeal in the Trevino lawsuit, the 
U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals unanimously decides that City Council members 
can be individually sued if they use taxpayer dollars to pay punitive damage 
awards for a police officer found liable for brutality. 
</P>
<P>
 Oct. 11, 1994: The U.S. Supreme Court lets the appellate court ruling stand. 
</P>
<P>
 Oct. 25, 1994: Trial of the lawsuit filed on behalf of Johanna Trevino is 
scheduled to begin in U.S. District Court.

ISRAEL SUSPENDS TALKS WITH PLO OVER KIDNAPING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin on Tuesday broke off talks with the Palestine 
Liberation Organization, closed the Gaza Strip and said the peace process will 
be jeopardized if an Israeli soldier kidnaped by Hamas, a militant Islamic 
group, is harmed. 
</P>
<P>
 Rabin told PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat that Israel holds him and the 
self-governing authority he heads responsible for the soldier's safe return, a 
Rabin spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The prime minister ordered Dany Rothschild, Israel's chief negotiator with the 
Palestinians, to return for consultations from Cairo, where Israel and the PLO 
are negotiating terms for holding Palestinian elections in the West Bank and 
Gaza. 
</P>
<P>
 Rabin told Arafat that, if the kidnaped Israeli soldier is harmed, "it may 
have a grave influence on Israel's relations with the Palestinian Authority, 
and on the future of the peace process," spokesman Oded Ben-Ami told Israel 
Radio. 
</P>
<P>
 In Gaza, Arafat convened his military advisers but issued no statement. An 
aide said he was monitoring the case closely. 
</P>
<P>
 In a videotape and handwritten statement delivered to a news agency office in 
Gaza, the Izzidin al Qassam military unit of Hamas claimed it had abducted 
Nachshon Waxman, 19 -- whom it identified as Nachshon Mordechai -- and said it 
will kill him by 9 p.m. Friday unless Israel meets its demands. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hamas announcement came just one day after the group claimed 
responsibility for a bloody attack on Israelis carried out by two gunmen Sunday 
night in downtown Jerusalem. That incident left two people dead and 13 wounded. 
The two attackers were killed by paramilitary police. 
</P>
<P>
 Hamas on Tuesday demanded the release of its founder, Sheik Ahmed Yassin; 
another leader, Sheik Salah Shehada, and two clerics of the militant Lebanese 
Islamic movement Hezbollah, Sheik Abdel Karim Obeid and Sheik Mustafa Dirani. 
Israel kidnaped Obeid from southern Lebanon more than five years ago. It has 
held him inside Israel ever since. The Israelis kidnaped Dirani on May 21 and 
have held him. 
</P>
<P>
 Hamas also insisted on freedom from imprisonment for dozens of its followers, 
members of another militant Islamic group, Islamic Jihad, and members of three 
PLO factions. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the Israeli government refuses our demands, it must carry the 
responsibility of the murder of the soldier and then we will negotiate 
afterward on his body," Hamas said in its statement. 
</P>
<P>
 An Israeli army spokesman refused to comment directly on the kidnaping, 
although military sources confirmed that Waxman has been missing since Sunday 
night. He was last seen hitchhiking in the coastal plain town of Ramle. 
</P>
<P>
 A friend who left him at a Ramle intersection said Waxman hoped to get a ride 
to his home in Jerusalem. His mother, Esther, issued an emotional appeal on 
Israel Television to her son's kidnapers, asking Hamas "in the name of God, 
return my son to me." 
</P>
<P>
 The kidnaping poses a severe test of the power of Arafat, who returned to Gaza 
on Tuesday night after attending a funeral in Morocco. 
</P>
<P>
 In May, Israel turned over responsibility for running daily life in Gaza to 
the PLO. Since then, Hamas has carried out operations against Israeli soldiers 
and civilians, inside the Gaza Strip and within the boundaries of pre-1967 
Israel. Each time an attack has occurred, Arafat has been pressured to publicly 
condemn it and to seek out and punish the perpetrators. 
</P>
<P>
 He has issued condemnations but has avoided cracking down on Hamas, which 
enjoys widespread popular support in Gaza. Arafat has sought accommodation with 
the group, hoping to entice it into running in Palestinian elections, due to be 
held in the next several months. 
</P>
<P>
 But this time, Hamas has pushed Arafat into a corner by kidnaping the soldier 
and demanding the release of Palestinian prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
 Arafat and his embryonic government have been severely criticized by many 
Palestinians for failing to win the release of all prisoners held in Israeli 
jails. Israel has held up the release of 4,000 prisoners, saying it wants 
assurances that the Palestinian Authority can handle the security situation in 
Gaza before freeing them. 
</P>
<P>
 But by closing the Gaza Strip, Israel is increasing the pressure on Arafat. 
Each day, tens of thousands of Gazans cross into Israel for work -- the primary 
source of jobs for the impoverished strip. A closure that lasts more than a few 
days is likely to severely strain the precarious finances of many Gaza 
families. 
</P>
<P>
 The kidnaping is embarrassing for Rabin, who expects later this week to be 
named -- with Arafat -- the recipient of this year's Nobel Peace Prize. Rabin 
faces attack from the right wing in Israel for signing an agreement that 
prevents Israel from pursuing into Gaza guerrillas who carry out attacks inside 
Israel. He is likely to come under enormous pressure to make an exception in 
this case and search Gaza for Waxman before Friday's deadline.

10 INJURED AS STUDENTS' CAR CRASHES, FLIPS

<P>
 Ten people were hurt, three of them seriously, when a car full of Capistrano 
Valley High School students careened out of control Tuesday morning, collided 
with oncoming traffic and flipped over, trapping three youths inside. 
</P>
<P>
 The three students had to be pried out of the mangled Toyota sedan with Jaws 
of Life tools after passersby managed to free the other teen-agers and tend to 
other motorists hurt in the wreck. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators had not determined the cause of the 7:30 a.m. crash, but 
witnesses told police the car carrying the students was weaving in and out of 
traffic and appeared to be traveling at least 70 m.p.h. when it sideswiped 
another car and lost control as the six students headed to school. 
</P>
<P>
 The car hurtled through the intersection of Marguerite Parkway and Estanciero 
Drive before it struck a stopped Ford Explorer head-on, said Sheriff's Sgt. 
Fred Lisanti. The impact tossed the Toyota into the air and into an oncoming 
car before it came to rest on its roof. 
</P>
<P>
 The Toyota's driver, Kenneth Wong, 18, of Mission Viejo was airlifted to 
Mission Hospital Regional Medical Center with injuries that included a 
concussion and broken arms and legs.

OUT OF HIS ELEMENT; DISCOVERY WON'T BE NAMED FOR CHEMIST -- BECAUSE HE'S ALIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS H. MAUGH II, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Chemist Glenn T. Seaborg of the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory will not have a 
new element named for him after all -- because the Nobel laureate is still 
alive. 
</P>
<P>
 No element has ever been named after a living person, but earlier this year 
the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory team that created element 106 a 
quarter-century ago proposed that it be named seaborgium in honor of the 
discoverer of plutonium and former chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, even though seaborgium has been endorsed by a number of prestigious 
American scientific groups, the international organization responsible for 
naming chemicals says that element 106 will instead be named rutherfordium, for 
deceased British nuclear physicist Ernest Rutherford. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very disappointed," the 81-year-old Seaborg said Tuesday. "The name was 
chosen by the discoverers of the element, and this would be the first time in 
history that the name chosen by the discoverers was not adopted." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm horrified. This just doesn't make any sense to me," said physicist Albert 
Ghiorso, who headed the team that discovered element 106. "I obviously 
disapprove, and so does everyone else associated with it." 
</P>
<P>
 Seaborg and Ghiorso also said there is precedent for naming elements after 
living people. They noted that the Berkeley team named elements 99 and 100 
after physicists Albert Einstein and Enrico Fermi while both men were alive. 
But because of the Cold War climate, those discoveries -- and the chosen names 
-- were classified secret. By the time the information was declassified, both 
of the great scientists were dead. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, there had never been a written prohibition against naming an element 
after a living person until August, when a 20-member committee of the 
International Union of Pure & Applied Chemistry formally accepted such a 
proposal. That vote, in effect, ruled out the Berkeley group's March proposal 
to name element 106 seaborgium. 
</P>
<P>
 One member of the committee, chemist Anthony J. Arduengo III of the DuPont 
Co., told the trade journal Chemical & Engineering News: "Discoverers don't 
have a right to name an element. They have a right to suggest a name. And, of 
course, we didn't infringe on that at all." 
</P>
<P>
 Ghiorso, however, argued that "never in the history of the world" has the 
discoverer of an element been deprived of naming it. The Berkeley group 
discovered and named several, including plutonium, berkelium, californium, 
einsteinium and fermium. 
</P>
<P>
 The team also discovered elements 104 and 105 and, ironically, proposed the 
name rutherfordium for 104 and hahnium for 105, the latter in honor of German 
chemist Otto Hahn. But the International Union of Pure & Applied Chemistry 
committee has decided to change both names. Element 104, the committee said, 
will be named dubnium, after the nuclear research center in Dubna, Russia, that 
has found several heavy elements. Element 105 will be named joliotium, after 
pioneering French physicist Frederic Joliot-Curie. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision "really louses up the scientific literature" because researchers 
have been using those names in publications for 20 years, said Berkeley 
physicist Darleane C. Hoffman. The name seaborgium has also appeared in 
scientific papers and periodic tables of the elements. 
</P>
<P>
 Concluded Seaborg: "I think it's all a terrible mistake." 
</P>
<P>
 Ghiorso noted that the new names have one last obstacle to overcome, 
ratification by a higher committee next August, and said he hopes that the 
original names will be restored. "After all, we have right on our side." New

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / U.S. SENATE; HUFFINGTON SAYS CRITICS FEAR HIS 'BOAT 
ROCKING' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Seeking to carve out his political identity, Republican Senate candidate Mike 
Huffington characterized himself Tuesday as a "risk taker" and a "boat rocker" 
who is under attack because he is challenging the Washington political 
Establishment. 
</P>
<P>
 Relying on a fistful of GOP buzzwords and likening himself at one point to 
another conservative outsider -- Ronald Reagan -- the congressman from Santa 
Barbara called on Californians to "welcome God back into our public lives and 
into our public square." 
</P>
<P>
 In a speech to the Commonwealth Club billed as a major policy address, 
Huffington cast himself as citizen-politician whose ideas threaten the nation's 
Democratic leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am a businessman who wants to get government out of the way so that we can 
unleash the entrepreneurial spirit of the American people. . . ," he said. "By 
questioning the myths of the dominant liberal culture upon which politics as 
usual is founded, I have drawn a line in the sand of time, and they are afraid 
of being found out, stranded standing on the wrong side of history." 
</P>
<P>
 While seeking to tap into this year's deep current of voter frustration, 
Huffington offered few concrete proposals for change. And he ducked several 
questions from the audience, including where he stands on Proposition 187, the 
controversial anti-illegal immigrant measure on the state ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked about it, Huffington seemed unfamiliar with Proposition 187 and briefly 
stumbled in his answer. "I have not yet made a public stand on 170 -- er, what 
was that? 187? As you can tell," he said as members of the audience called out 
the correct name. ". . . I'll look at all the initiatives before the end of the 
election campaign and take a public stance on one or two of them." 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington, who has campaigned largely through television commercials, made 
his appearance before the Commonwealth Club at a crucial time for his campaign. 
He has campaigned to near even with his rival, Democratic Sen. Dianne 
Feinstein. 
</P>
<P>
 But over the past two weeks, he has faced more intensive press scrutiny and 
has been criticized over the campaign role of his wife, Arianna Huffington, a 
onetime minister in the Movement of Spiritual Inner Awareness, a controversial 
religious group. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, Feinstein secured passage of a landmark bill protecting nearly 8 
million acres of California's desert. 
</P>
<P>
 In his address, Huffington joked about the claims that his wife dominates his 
campaign, saying: "I want to dispel any notion that she's the driving force 
behind this campaign, a point I will make many times in this speech that she 
wrote for me." 
</P>
<P>
 After the speech, Arianna Huffington stood by as her husband answered 
questions from reporters, but the couple abruptly left when the questioning 
turned to her role in the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 In answering questions from Commonwealth Club members, Huffington criticized 
Feinstein's desert bill, saying it was amended to include the creation of a 
jazz park in New Orleans "at the eleventh hour" because Feinstein was 
"desperate" to win passage. 
</P>
<P>
 "This bill exemplifies what's wrong with government and the special interests 
and career politicians," Huffington said. "The California Desert Protection 
Bill was supposed to be about protecting the California desert." 
</P>
<P>
 However, Feinstein campaign manager Kam Kuwata said that in fact the jazz park 
amendment was approved last April, and was not any part of a deal to get the 
bill passed at the last minute. 
</P>
<P>
 "The implication that she traded votes is totally wrong," Kuwata said. "Dianne 
Feinstein doesn't trade votes. This is a bill that's going to protect some very 
important land in California. I realize it's a huge embarrassment (for 
Huffington) because he campaigns on the theme one person can't make a 
difference." 
</P>
<P>
 The Feinstein campaign also contested Huffington's characterization of himself 
as a man who takes risks and poses a threat to the Establishment. 
</P>
<P>
 "Where has he rocked the boat?" Kuwata said. "Where has he taken a risk? 
Fundamentally, what Congressman Huffington has done is say, 'I'm going to vote 
against everything.' I characterize him as a fraud because he claims to have 
done things he hasn't done." Political Scorecard 
</P>
<P>
 27 days to go before Californians go to the polls 
</P>
<P>
 THE GOVERNOR'S RACE 
</P>
<P>
 * What Happened Tuesday: The campaign of Democrat Kathleen Brown accused 
Republican Gov. Pete Wilson of neglecting the state's highway and 
transportation system. Wilson received the endorsement of Northern California 
law enforcement groups at Rancho Cordova, near Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 * What's Ahead: Wilson will kick off Fire Prevention Week, and receive the 
endorsement of California firefighters associations during an appearance at the 
Burbank Fire Training Center. Brown's schedule was uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
 THE SENATE RACE 
</P>
<P>
 * What Happened Tuesday: Sen. Dianne Feinstein attended a luncheon in Santa 
Rosa. Rep. Mike Huffington addressed the Commonwealth Club in San Francisco and 
was to attend a private fund-raising dinner in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 * What's Ahead: Huffington was planning to deliver a luncheon address to the 
Orange County Forum in Newport Beach. Feinstein was to meet in Oakland with 
residents who lost their homes in the 1991 fire, followed by lunch with 
supporters in Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
 NOTABLE QUOTE 
</P>
<P>
 "So what my campaign is about is . . . a new vision of how politics could, and 
should, work in America. My opponent says I have no ideas, but the truth is 
that my ideas are beyond the horizon of her world view." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Huffington in address to the Commonwealth Club in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 LIGHTER NOTE 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington said his debate with Feinstein on "Larry King Live" on the Cable 
News Network last week performed a great public service for CNN viewers. Not by 
illuminating the Senate race, but, Huffington said, "for the first time since 
June, we caused Larry to preempt O.J. Simpson coverage." CONGRESSIONAL

STUDENT AID COMMISSION CHIEF QUITS; EDUCATION: FEDERAL PRESSURE ON DIRECTOR OF 
CALIFORNIA PANEL FORCES HIS RESIGNATION. ACTION COMES AFTER U.S. SAYS STATE 
AGENCY HAD COLLECTED MILLIONS MORE THAN IT DESERVED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By J. MICHAEL KENNEDY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Under pressure from the federal government to step down, the executive 
director of the embattled California Student Aid Commission resigned Tuesday, 
saying he was doing so to help restore the little-known state agency's sullied 
reputation. 
</P>
<P>
 The resignation of Samuel M. Kipp III is the latest in a string of 
developments that has pitted the U.S. Department of Education against the 
commission, which administers millions of dollars in student loans in the 
state. 
</P>
<P>
 The battle began last year when the federal agency conducted an audit and 
claimed that the student aid commission had collected millions of dollars more 
than it deserved from the federal government because it had overstated its 
portfolio of outstanding loans by $1.5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 The stakes went higher in August when the education department demanded that 
the commission pay $62.6 million worth of defaulted student loans and that it 
fire its top administrators because of "unprecedented" mistakes in the handling 
of student loans over several years. It also ordered that the commission junk 
its $14-million computer system, described by the education department as 
"muddled, convoluted and . . . archaic." 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, the federal agency said that unless something was done to rectify 
the situation, the education department "will have no choice but to terminate" 
its relationship with the commission and find someone else to administer the 
federally guaranteed student loan program in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 Kipp, director of the agency for nine years, submitted his resignation in a 
letter to Commission Chairman Mike Carona. In it, he said that he wanted "to do 
everything possible to assure that the commission prevails and successfully 
resolves its dispute with the Department of Education." 
</P>
<P>
 Kipp was referring to a lawsuit filed in September by the state attorney 
general's office against the education department, contesting the order to pay 
the $62.6 million. In the lawsuit, the attorney general's office said the 
commission would suffer irreparable damage if it had to pay that money to the 
federal government and called the demand "arbitrary and capricious." 
</P>
<P>
 In a statement by Carona after accepting the resignation, he praised Kipp for 
the "myriad accomplishments of the agency under his leadership." 
</P>
<P>
 Later, in a telephone interview, Carona said Kipp's resignation fell short of 
the original demand that all the high-ranking administrators leave the staff. 
But he said Kipp was clearly a target during the past year. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's clear the Department of Education wanted Sam's head," he said. "He also 
took a lot of hits on the state level." 
</P>
<P>
 Sean Walsh, Gov. Pete Wilson's press secretary, said he did not know of any 
pressure from the governor's office for Kipp to resign. 
</P>
<P>
 The resignation brought quick response from Kathleen Brown, Wilson's opponent 
in the gubernatorial race. 
</P>
<P>
 "Like the Energizer bunny, Pete Wilson's financial scandals keep going and 
going and going," she said. "For more than a year, he has defended his 
commission and its executive director. This occurred despite . . . the threat 
of a total federal pullout of our student loan program, jeopardizing billions 
of dollars of aid to middle-class students." 
</P>
<P>
 Walsh said Brown's comments did not merit a response.

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / PROPOSITION 187; FOES LAUNCH RADIO AD CAMPAIGN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL FELDMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Opponents of Proposition 187 launched their radio advertising campaign 
Tuesday, airing a tough 60-second spot charging that the anti-illegal 
immigration ballot measure would lead to increased crime and is being backed by 
white supremacists. 
</P>
<P>
 Sponsors of the initiative responded in interviews that the white supremacist 
allegation is ludicrous and potentially libelous. Furthermore, they said, it is 
racist on the part of opponents to declare that the crime rate would increase 
if young illegal immigrants are expelled from school. 
</P>
<P>
 The Taxpayers Against 187 ad says the measure, which would bar illegal 
immigrants from receiving most government services and would require educators 
and health care officials to report suspects to federal immigration 
authorities, would result in "300,000 kids out of school . . . and onto our 
streets, and that means more crime." The ad, running statewide, concludes that 
news accounts "show white supremacists are behind 187." 
</P>
<P>
 However, the supremacist charge is not backed by any further information in 
the ad, and at a Los Angeles news conference Tuesday, opponents of the measure 
acknowledged that they were not referring to the authors or main financial 
backers of Proposition 187. They said they were referring to an organization 
with no known direct links to the initiative's sponsors. 
</P>
<P>
 Karen Kapler, campaign manager for the anti-187 coalition, said the reference 
was to a New York-based organization, Pioneer Fund, which has provided annual 
grants to the Federation for American Immigration Reform as well as to 
scientific researchers including the late William B. Shockley, who claimed that 
blacks are inherently intellectually inferior to whites. 
</P>
<P>
 Trying to show a link between the Pioneer Fund and Proposition 187, Kapler 
said one of the initiative's authors, former federal immigration chief Alan C. 
Nelson, helped pen the ballot measure while he was working as a Sacramento 
lobbyist for FAIR last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Trace the trail down," Kapler said. "I think it's a legitimate thing to be 
raised. Is there kind of a convergence of ideas and thoughts?" 
</P>
<P>
 Nelson reacted angrily, saying he has no ties to the Pioneer Fund, which, as 
far as he knows, is not led by white supremacists anyway. "This shows how 
desperate the other side is," Nelson said. "The voters aren't being fooled by 
those kind of allegations." 
</P>
<P>
 He added that opponents of the measure are guilty of racism for painting a 
picture of anarchy in the streets once illegal immigrant children are expelled 
from public schools and colleges. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we said that kids will be on the street and will get involved in crime and 
most are Hispanic, we'd be accused of racism or anti-ethnic behavior. Here, the 
opponents are saying these kids, a big percentage of whom are Hispanic, will be 
on the street and get involved in crime. They are the ones that should be 
accused of anti-ethnic behavior." 
</P>
<P>
 Pioneer Fund President Harry Weyher has denied that his organization believes 
in white supremacy. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 187 co-author Harold Ezell termed the ad "a total lie." 
</P>
<P>
 "They're reaching to that goofy Pioneer Fund connection with FAIR, and FAIR 
had zero to do with this initiative," said the former western regional 
immigration chief. "Nelson was a part-time consultant to FAIR and I sure didn't 
call him to join in with us (in writing Proposition 187) because of that. I 
called him because I worked for him for seven years." 
</P>
<P>
 Political observers were mixed at the import and possible impact of the radio 
ad. 
</P>
<P>
 Prof. Bruce Cain of the Institute of Governmental Studies at UC Berkeley said 
the linking of white supremacists to Proposition 187 "is probably a non 
sequitur." But he added that it could prove effective because "the opposition 
strategy is to create doubts and negatives in people's minds." 
</P>
<P>
 Sherry Bebitch Jeffe of the Center for Politics and Economics at Claremont 
Graduate School disagreed. "Simple mudslinging without the perception of some 
corroboration isn't working as well as it might have once," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The anti-187 coalition, which last week reported having $250,000 cash on hand 
but $125,000 in debts, would not say how long the ad would run. Kapler said the 
coalition is still trying to raise enough funds to advertise on television. 
</P>
<P>
 Proponents of 187 have yet to run any radio or TV ads and last week reported a 
campaign debt of $276,000.

ON CALIFORNIA: THE WORLD ACCORDING TO HUFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER H. KING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 They wanted to know what he thought about Proposition 187, the anti-illegal 
immigrant initiative that has dominated this political season in California. 
The man who would be California's next U.S. senator had no opinion. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have not yet made a public stand on 170, er, what was that?" and here Mike 
Huffington began to stammer. 
</P>
<P>
 "One. Eighty. Seven," the people gathered in a ballroom at the Sheraton Palace 
chanted, trying to be helpful. 
</P>
<P>
 They wanted to know whether Huffington might, as some reports have suggested, 
intend to use a Senate seat only as a steppingstone toward the Presidency 
Itself. "Let me make this perfectly clear," he declared. He would serve no more 
than two terms in the U.S. Senate. "I hope that makes it clear," he concluded 
blithely, having said absolutely nothing about his Presidential ambitions, or 
lack thereof. 
</P>
<P>
 They wanted his thoughts on foreign policy, on Haiti, Somalia, Iraq, the hot 
spots. He spoke proudly of his days as a Pentagon assistant, flying off to 
Brussels, Paris, Vienna, London. He added, though, that it was not the role of 
U.S. senators to "micro-manage" foreign policy, and that was that on the topic 
of international affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 And so it went Tuesday, as Roy Michael Huffington Jr. waded into the last 
month of his audacious campaign to become U.S. senator from Texas via 
California. His appearance before the well-heeled Commonwealth Club of San 
Francisco provided a rare opportunity to see Huffington perform in person, 
outside a television set. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a curious performance. More than anything, Huffington proved himself to 
be a slow, careful reader. He had a prepared text, and he stuck to it, word by 
plodding word. He deviated only once in any significant fashion, inserting a 
paragraph early on that was intended to address the ongoing flurry of reports 
about his wife, her associations with a controversial religious sect and her 
behind-the-scenes role in his campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to dispel any notion," he read, "that she is the driving force behind 
my campaign -- a point I will make many times in this speech that she wrote for 
me." 
</P>
<P>
 The joke, not a bad one, registered but a few laughs. Similarly, his obvious 
applause lines were met most often with an embarrassing silence. It wasn't so 
much that this was a hostile crowd. The tepid response, frankly, seemed more a 
function of Huffington's delivery. When it comes to the entertainment of 
politics, he is no Ronald Reagan or even, for that matter, Bruce Herschensohn. 
They were conservatives who could make even the most hostile crowds come around 
with their wit, timing and obvious sense of passion. 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, Huffington's performance seemed almost devoid of any animation, 
any passion. He could have been reading the encyclopedia. He read slowly, 
painstakingly and, yes, accurately, attempting an occasional awkward hand 
gesture. At times it almost was painful to watch, and underscored the 
brilliance of his campaign handlers -- whoever they may be. They knew what they 
were doing when they kept Huffington under wraps for so long. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, even sentences delivered in monotone can look clever when quoted in 
print. And Lord knows Washington has enough pretty talkers already. Certainly, 
there were passages in Huffington's text most voters will find appealing. As 
this speech -- to borrow what seems to be the Huff's favorite phrase -- made 
perfectly clear, he's all for God, free trade, less taxes, efficient 
government, charitable works and simple human kindness. He opposes high taxes, 
pork, fraud and "them." 
</P>
<P>
 Who is "them?" Them, to borrow from the speech, is the 
"Clinton-Feinstein-Boxer regime." Them is the "good ol' boy network, the 
pundits, the PACs, the lobbyists." Them is "big government" and "the Beltway 
Establishment," the "Capital Gang" and the "secular fundamentalists." 
</P>
<P>
 The text was loaded with such phrases, each meant to signal to a disgruntled 
populace that Huffington is the new Ross Perot, a protest candidate 
volunteering to serve as a blunt instrument with which the angry and 
dispossessed -- "us," in his political construction -- can bash "them." His 
message is: Send a message, vote Huffington, and who cares if he doesn't know 
diddly about the details of governance? 
</P>
<P>
 This is a powerful and increasingly popular approach. For good reason, bashing 
government has replaced baseball as the national pastime. It is the message -- 
along with $10 million in media buys -- that has lifted this unknown from the 
Texas oil patch into a dead heat with his opponent, Dianne Feinstein. Any 
serious government basher with enough money could have done the same. The 
question in Huffington's case is whether he, as a sitting congressman and 
former Pentagon bureaucrat himself, truly believes in the words -- or only in 
their political power. His performance Tuesday provided no clear answer. But he 
sure can read.

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION; OPPONENTS TRADE 
BARBS IN CABLE TV DEBATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEAN MERL, TIMES EDUCATION WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The race for state schools chief heated up Tuesday as candidates Maureen 
DiMarco and Delaine Eastin traded verbal blows in a tense, one-hour dust-up 
that will be aired on cable television over the next three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 DiMarco chided Eastin, a Democratic assemblywoman, for voting against funds to 
expand public preschools "while she was voting to increase her own salary" as a 
legislator. 
</P>
<P>
 Eastin had this to say about her opponent, a fellow Democrat who is the 
Republican governor's secretary for child development and education: "Every 
time Pete Wilson has made a bad proposal, my opponent has held his coat and 
egged him on." 
</P>
<P>
 These and other barbs punctuated a League of Women Voters-sponsored debate in 
Santa Monica moderated by commentator Bill Rosendahl of Century Cable. With few 
ideological differences in their battle to become the state's first woman 
superintendent of public instruction, each candidate has increasingly made her 
opponent the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Eastin set the tone by bringing up the Wilson Administration's ill-fated 
attempt in the summer of 1992 to save about $3 million in the state budget by 
delaying kindergarten for thousands of children. DiMarco defended the proposal 
as educationally sound, claiming it was suggested by kindergarten teachers who 
noted that some youngsters who turn 5 shortly before the state's Dec. 1 cutoff 
date were not yet ready for school. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Administration dropped its proposal to change the cutoff date to Sept. 
1 after parents and educators widely denounced forcing youngsters to wait a 
year before entering school. 
</P>
<P>
 "A cockamamie solution" is how Eastin described it Tuesday, using the proposal 
to bolster her claim that Wilson, with DiMarco as his apologist, has made 
building "gold-plated prisons" a higher priority than the state's public 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "Typical Legislature rhetoric" retorted DiMarco, arguing that the 
Administration did as much or more for school budgets than anyone could 
reasonably expect in fiscally tough times. 
</P>
<P>
 DiMarco, tracing her 22-year involvement in public education, starting as a 
volunteer in her daughters' classrooms, said Eastin "never had a single day" of 
experience in a kindergarten-through-12th-grade setting. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll put my experience up against hers any day," snapped Eastin, chairwoman 
of the Assembly Education Committee and a former community college instructor. 
</P>
<P>
 They had some of their sharpest exchanges over the recently vetoed California 
Learning Assessment System, the statewide student testing program. 
</P>
<P>
 Eastin accused DiMarco, who urged the governor to veto legislation that would 
have continued the three-year-old system for five more years, of throwing the 
$50 million spent on CLAS down the drain mainly to mollify the political right. 
She added that DiMarco did not cooperate with the CLAS bill's author, Sen. Gary 
K. Hart (D-Santa Barbara) in trying to work out a compromise. 
</P>
<P>
 "How sad she wasn't present at the table earlier," Eastin said. 
</P>
<P>
 DiMarco called Eastin's portrayal "incredible revisionist history" and said 
she deserved credit for sounding the alarm when things began to go wrong with 
the testing system. DiMarco blamed problems with the tests mostly on the state 
Department of Education, which she said did not deliver the kind of system that 
was outlined in the 1991 legislation that created the CLAS program. 
</P>
<P>
 The contenders managed to hurl their fusillades even while responding to 
questions that showed them agreeing on issues more often than not. For example, 
both call for "zero tolerance" of guns and drugs on campus, do not believe a 
teacher's sexual orientation should be an issue, and support sex education and 
teaching about AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 The rivalry sometimes turned into a game of one-upmanship. When DiMarco found 
an opportunity to mention her endorsements from two statewide police 
organizations, Eastin took a moment the next time she had the floor to note 
that she had the largest police support organization in the state and the 
California Assn. of Highway Patrolmen in her column.

BUILDUP IN THE PERSIAN GULF; PROBE OF TUSTIN MARINE'S DEATH

<TEXT>
<P>
 U.S. Marine officials are investigating the death of a Tustin-based Marine who 
apparently drowned last week when he fell off the amphibious assault ship 
Tripoli, which was speeding toward the Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
 Cpl. Steven Mosier, 20, a technician who had been based at the Marine Corps 
Air Station in Tustin for about a year, fell overboard about 9:45 p.m. Friday, 
Marine officials said. Divers searched the waters for 24 hours but were unable 
to recover Mosier's body.

BUILDUP IN THE PERSIAN GULF; KUWAITIS ANGRY OVER RECURRING THREAT BY IRAQ; 
GULF: DESPITE TROOP PULLBACK, RESIDENTS RESENT HUSSEIN'S REIGN OF TERROR.

 Mohammed Ali Jassem worked his way slowly down the narrow supermarket aisle 
after work Tuesday, loading the shopping cart with a large case of bottled 
water while his wife, Shireen, bought two packages each of sugar, flour, rice, 
tea and a few other staples. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hate this," Jassem said, adding a case of long-life milk to the groceries. 
"Every time that jerk Saddam Hussein gets a nutty idea, we and the rest of the 
world have to go crazy with him." 
</P>
<P>
 Like most Kuwaitis, Jassem and his wife were stocking their pantry "just in 
case," as he put it, "another 350 American warplanes cannot make Iraq 
understand the futility of these threats against us." 
</P>
<P>
 Like most Kuwaitis, the Jassems are remaining here despite the crisis on the 
border with Iraq -- although with extra gasoline for a getaway to Saudi Arabia 
if need be. 
</P>
<P>
 And like most Kuwaitis, they expect Iraqi President Saddam Hussein to "chicken 
out," as Jassem put it with a Texas twang. 
</P>
<P>
 "The trouble is, how to be sure," said Jassem, 34, a computer technician who 
trained in Dallas. "In 1990, we were sure -- our government was sure, the 
United States was sure, everyone else was sure -- that Iraq would not attack. 
They not only attacked but swallowed us whole. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone now says that can't happen again. It probably can't. But what we do 
have is a guy who, every six or eight months, starts breathing heavily and 
flexing his muscles and we have to prepare for the very worst. How can we live 
this way? And why should we have to?" 
</P>
<P>
 Even as the threat of an imminent Iraqi attack receded, Kuwaitis seemed more 
angered than relieved, more annoyed with the inability of the world to deal a 
final blow to Saddam Hussein than pleased that the forthright stand by the 
United States had halted the buildup. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once again, Iraq seems to have gotten away with it," businessman Ahmed Juhail 
complained, "and that means it will begin all over again in a few months. We 
will have to stay on our guard, keep a month's food in the house, $10,000 in 
the safe, cans of gasoline in the garage and loaded guns in the closet. Isn't 
it time the world does something about Saddam Hussein?" 
</P>
<P>
 In the traditional evening meetings that Kuwait's leaders hold in their homes, 
in the souks where merchants have modernized their stores with air conditioning 
and in high-rise office buildings where the country's considerable wealth is 
managed, the strong feeling Tuesday was that Iraq had been turned back but that 
Saddam Hussein should be punished. 
</P>
<P>
 "We saw this crime in time to stop it, thank God, but just in time," said 
Ibrahim Quraishi, an engineer who has spent much of the last three years 
rebuilding Kuwait. "You can feel the nerves of society relaxing. It may be a 
delusion, but it seems we are safe -- for now. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are two questions: how to prevent further mischief by this man, and how 
to exact a price for all this. If we see action there, we can really relax." 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the crisis, the Kuwaiti mood has been one of calm preparation -- a 
confidence in the alliance their government has forged with their neighbors and 
the West, a confidence that their small army of 18,000 will fight and not run 
if attacked and a confidence in themselves and their will to resist. 
</P>
<P>
 Though lines formed at gas stations, markets and banks when Kuwaitis learned 
of the buildup, there has been no panicked flight. 
</P>
<P>
 The prime minister, Crown Prince Sheik Saad al Abdullah al Sabah, returned two 
days early from a trip to Italy to rally his people. In a fighting speech, he 
declared, "We will pay the price, no matter what, to defend Kuwait. Iraq should 
understand that the Kuwaiti people -- men, women, the elderly and the young -- 
have agreed on one word, which is 'death' for the sake of Kuwait." 
</P>
<P>
 The Cabinet has held emergency sessions each day, Saad has addressed 
Parliament and the Kuwaiti press has given full coverage to the crisis -- all 
in contrast to the government's frightened and hasty retreat in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Two hospitals were put on alert, the government opened its warehouses to 
ensure a steady supply of food and stable prices, and army reserves were 
quickly deployed. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know that our allies will come, fast and hard, in a crisis," said banker 
Yousef Quraishi. ". . . But we are not a people that wants to live under the 
gun, subject to the moods and ambitions and rages of a madman." 
</P>
<P>
 Ahmed Bakr, a member of the Islamic group in Parliament, sees the crisis as a 
step in Hussein's "strategy to build up his power again in the region. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 "Whereas in 1990 he wanted our land and our oil, today he uses us for 
political leverage in a power play," Bakr said. "Threaten Kuwait and make the 
West respond -- it's a simple tactic, and among the Arabs it pays off. The only 
way to frustrate it is to make it too costly to use again." 
</P>
<P>
 Kuwait has sought to ensure its safety through 10-year defense agreements with 
four of the five permanent Security Council members -- Britain, France, Russia 
and the United States. China, the other permanent member, is expected to sign a 
similar pact by year's end. 
</P>
<P>
 For Kuwaitis, many of whom have strong and bitter memories of the Iraqi 
occupation, these are not theoretical questions, but hard and intensely 
personal concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 "What do I tell my daughters about rape?" asked Najiba Mutairi, 40, a social 
worker with three girls, 12, 13 and 15. "They know that four years ago, the 
Iraqis raped many, many women as a form of torture, and every time there is a 
buildup on the border they get very, very frightened for themselves, for me, 
for their friends. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "We have to live with the collective memory of that occupation. We are a small 
nation, a family where everyone seems to know everyone, and thus what happened 
to anyone happened to us."

SOCIAL ISSUES; COUPLE'S BRUSH WITH THE LAW CALLED ORWELLIAN INTRUSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Americans are always on the lookout for that old political bogyman, Big 
Brother. But citizens in Washington state may have special cause to wonder if 
the Orwellian vision of someone eternally butting in has come to pass. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, just last week Washington started enforcing its stringent statewide 
ban on smoking in all workplace offices -- public and private. And in a 
celebrated case several years ago, two Seattle area restaurant workers 
repeatedly tried to persuade a pregnant patron to order something more 
healthful than a daiquiri. They were fired, but the public debate reverberated 
for weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Now come allegations from a young couple with an unusual story. 
</P>
<P>
 Lost and a little late for a pre-abortion procedure at a clinic last summer, 
Justin Cooper, 20, and Deanna Thomas, 18, say they were pulled over by a state 
patrolman while admittedly doing 75 m.p.h. on the freeway. After telling him 
where they were headed and why, they say, Patrolman Lane W. Jackstadt, 34, kept 
them on the shoulder of the road for 45 minutes, holding onto Cooper's license 
while encouraging them to forgo the abortion and consider the alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, they say, Jackstadt led them 20 miles to a house and a dimly lit 
basement, where a counselor appeared with literature and more talk about 
abortion alternatives. Convinced the patrolman was no longer around to follow 
them, they finally left for the appointment, hours late. Thomas had the 
abortion the next day. 
</P>
<P>
 During a press conference here Tuesday where the couple nervously read 
prepared statements, their lawyer, Franklin W. Shoichet, said the pair was 
intimidated and went along with Jackstadt because of his "abuse of power" and 
his "jackboot tactics." While the anti-abortion counselor did not mistreat 
them, Shoichet said, they didn't want to leave the house -- which is actually a 
counseling center run by a local church -- because "they feared (Jackstadt) was 
still on the grounds." 
</P>
<P>
 The state attorney general's office will review the case starting as early as 
this week and would not comment on possible charges, which Shoichet thinks 
should include felony unlawful imprisonment. Jackstadt has not spoken publicly 
and has been reassigned to desk duty while the investigation continues. His 
lawyer said Tuesday that there are "two sides to every story and the only side 
being aired now is the other side." He said Jackstadt was "not able to make a 
comment at this time." 
</P>
<P>
 The case has drawn attention from both sides of the abortion debate. Chris 
Charbonneau, president of Planned Parenthood of Seattle/King County, said that 
the incident is "a warning to law enforcement officers that a certain code of 
conduct is expected. Their private opinions don't pertain. . . . For officials 
all across the country, this is a heads-up to stick to your business." 
</P>
<P>
 But Don Treshman, national director of the anti-abortion group Rescue America, 
said that the patrolman's actions were understandable. "I think it's a novel 
way for a police officer to uphold his oath of office. I mean, to serve and 
protect is for the born and the unborn as well." Treshman claimed not to know 
details of the case but said, "If he (Jackstadt) did it properly, it could be 
done legally." 
</P>
<P>
 The house where Jackstadt allegedly led the couple is called Special Delivery, 
an off-site ministry run by Overlake Christian Church in suburban Kirkland. 
Associate Pastor Tim Avery said that Jackstadt attends Overlake, which claims 
to be the largest church in the Northwest. Avery said that anyone who ever 
comes to Special Delivery for abortion counseling does so freely and is not 
forced to stay. He said Thomas and Cooper were free to leave at any time. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Washingtonians wonder who the next tap on the shoulder will come 
from. The generally conservative Bellevue Journal American editorialized that 
the implications of police wielding their morality like a baton were 
"frightening. . . . If police can detain you on behalf of their personal 
beliefs," the paper wrote, "what's next? A vegetarian cop ticketing people on 
the way to McDonald's?"

SHARP DROP BY RUBLE BELIES TALK OF ECONOMIC STABILITY; RUSSIA: ONE-QUARTER FALL 
AGAINST DOLLAR RAISES DOUBTS ABOUT ABILITY TO CONTROL CURRENCY DURING 
POST-COMMUNIST REFORMS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The enfeebled Russian ruble tumbled by more than one-quarter of its value 
against the dollar Tuesday in a day of panicked trading that heralded greater 
inflation and instability just as the Kremlin seemed to have the economy nearly 
under control. 
</P>
<P>
 The ruble fell from 3,081 to the dollar to 3,926, a record drop that prompted 
Russians to dub the day "Black Tuesday." Overall, the ruble's value has been 
cut in half since July. 
</P>
<P>
 "What has happened to the supposedly stabilized economy?" demanded the evening 
newspaper Izvestia. "What can we expect tomorrow and the day after?" 
</P>
<P>
 In a country now getting used to financial debacles, from ill-considered money 
swaps to massive pyramid schemes, this was one of the biggest, casting doubt on 
the government's ability to control its currency as it navigates through 
tricky, post-Communist economic reforms. 
</P>
<P>
 "The jump of the dollar on the currency market is a basis for throwing (Prime 
Minister Viktor S.) Chernomyrdin into prison," prominent businessman Konstantin 
Borovoi fumed in print. "In any other country, after such a jump of the dollar 
against the national currency there would be a revolution." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, no revolution threatened; money-exchange booths in Moscow remained 
calm, and people in line groused quietly about the speculators who were 
probably making fortunes off the sharp change in rate. The Central Bank 
intervened in trading on the Moscow Interbank Currency Exchange, the country's 
largest, to keep the ruble from falling below 4,000 to the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
 But the possible consequences of the ruble drop worried both Western and 
Russian economists deeply. 
</P>
<P>
 "The continuing sharp drop of the ruble to the dollar means an intensive 
crescendo of inflation," Alexander Zhukov, a member of the Russian Parliament's 
Budget Committee, told the Itar-Tass news agency. 
</P>
<P>
 As the dollar gains in strength, imported goods become relatively more 
expensive for Russians to buy with their ruble salaries, and those price hikes 
fuel inflation. By Tuesday evening, the new rate's effect could already be seen 
in the fresh, inflated price tags on beer and candy in many of the city's 
kiosks. Lines in stores and at gas stations also lengthened as customers 
struggled to unload their rubles fast. 
</P>
<P>
 Western economists warn that with the inevitable rise in prices comes a 
temptation for the Kremlin to print more money and issue more cheap loans to 
ease the burden on people. That would fuel inflation even further. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously what's happened is going to complicate things," said a Western 
economic adviser to the government. "Certainly there's been a loss of 
confidence -- the markets are all voting on that." 
</P>
<P>
 "If there is a retreat back to a pro-inflation psychology, to investing in the 
dollar and daily spending rather than saving, we will have lost this year, a 
difficult year of deprivations," said Alexander Livshits, a top economic 
adviser to President Boris N. Yeltsin. "We simply cannot allow this to happen." 
</P>
<P>
 The only winners in the ruble crash -- aside from smart speculators -- seemed 
to be Russia's exporters, the oil and metal magnates who now can offer their 
goods abroad at lower prices. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's heaven for exporters and hell for importers," said economist Pavel 
Bunich of the new ruble rate. 
</P>
<P>
 Most economists said the ruble fell so sharply mainly because of panic 
selling, but there was also an objective reason. Beginning last month, the 
Central Bank stopped propping up the ruble by injecting hundreds of millions of 
dollars into the foreign exchange market. 
</P>
<P>
 The Central Bank "had seen the bottom of its own well," Bunich said, after it 
had spent more than $2 billion on buying up rubles over the last two months. 
</P>
<P>
 Trading of the ruble, mainly for dollars and German marks, has gone on since 
1992 at the Moscow exchange, but the ruble is still not fully convertible 
throughout the world, and the government has kept a tight hold on its rate. 
</P>
<P>
 When the hold loosened, economists said, the ruble's fall was inevitable. Some 
are predicting that the ruble will rise back to about 3,000 to the dollar when 
the speculation and panic cool down. 
</P>
<P>
 But meanwhile, the powerful dollar has Russian importers, whose goods have 
suddenly skyrocketed in price, near despair. Many are simply freezing their 
operations until the dollar rate settles down, Russian media reported.

HAITIAN ARMY PRONOUNCED DEAD AS ARM OF REPRESSION; CARIBBEAN: WITH ITS TOP 
LEADERS OUT, DEBATE BEGINS ON HOW TO RESTRUCTURE IT. SOME QUESTION WHETHER THE 
NATION NEEDS A FULL-FLEDGED MILITARY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 For all intents and purposes, Haiti's army, an instrument of corruption and 
repression by tyrants and dictators across nearly two centuries, no longer 
exists, according to U.S. officials and military officers. 
</P>
<P>
 "It died yesterday. It is a corpse, it just hasn't been buried yet. That comes 
Saturday," said a senior U.S. army officer. 
</P>
<P>
 He spoke of the resignation Monday of former Commander in Chief Lt. Gen. Raoul 
Cedras and his chief aide, Brig. Gen. Philippe Biamby, and this Saturday's 
restoration of Jean-Bertrand Aristide as president. 
</P>
<P>
 Cedras, Biamby and police chief Lt. Col. Michel-Joseph Francois had ruled 
Haiti with vengeance and greed for more than three years since Aristide was 
driven into exile by a military coup. 
</P>
<P>
 But with American patience exhausted and President Clinton embarrassed by the 
Haitian army's refusal to give in to traditional pressure and threats, American 
troops put an effective end to the troika Sept. 19. 
</P>
<P>
 It was never much of an army anyway. Although its current version is a mutant 
child of a national guard created by U.S. Marines during their 1915-1934 
occupation of Haiti, its mission was never a traditional military one. 
</P>
<P>
 "From the beginning," said a Haitian expert, "the army was designed to 
maintain order and protect the ruling elite and its property against popular 
movements. 
</P>
<P>
 "By the time Aristide was elected (in 1990), it had degraded even from the 
original goal and was nothing more than self-serving killers and thieves." 
</P>
<P>
 Led by men virtually more experienced in extortion than battle, equipped with 
weapons more useful to a gun museum than a fighting force and less trained than 
an American high-school ROTC unit, the armed forces of Haiti couldn't even 
march in step. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is an embarrassment," a French officer said in 1991 while watching Cedras 
lead his stumbling forces through a Military Day parade. "I have tin soldiers 
who march better than that." 
</P>
<P>
 The occupation also ended the entire concept of a Haitian army as it has been 
understood since Haitian slaves formed a military and drove out their French 
masters in 1804. 
</P>
<P>
 Since that year, a Haitian political expert said, the army, whether on its own 
or as the instrument of some class or another, became an institution that 
preceded all other institutions, according to Haitian experts. 
</P>
<P>
 "It represented independence and sovereignty for Haiti," said one former 
Haitian diplomat. "But in reality it ran this country without regard for any 
interests but its own. It was always more a feudal group of thugs than a real 
military institution." 
</P>
<P>
 "This army, if you can call it that, had a monopoly on violence and there was 
no counterweight," agreed a U.S. official. "It terrorized the people into 
cowardice, and it killed or corrupted anyone that could oppose it." 
</P>
<P>
 That is over now, the sources concluded. "The resignations (of the three 
leaders) are just the start," said a U.S. official. "Many of the rest of the 
officers will either quit or be purged, and the entire institution will be 
reformed and reduced to a relative handful." 
</P>
<P>
 The bloody role of the Haitian military right up to Sept. 19 raises questions 
in the minds of many Haitians, including some of Aristide's closest advisers, 
about the need for an army. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know we need police," said Franz Voltaire, an Aristide supporter and aide 
to acting Prime Minister Robert Malval. "But police will be armed only with 
pistols and side arms, not M-16s (assault rifles) and Uzis (submachine guns). 
</P>
<P>
 "Costa Rica doesn't have any army and it gets along OK. Let's just remove the 
temptation for future abuse." 
</P>
<P>
 Privately, many U.S. officials agree. But American policy continues to reflect 
a debate between traditional U.S. military concern for maintaining a 
conservative institution to offset regional instability and foreign-service 
experts who think that a small nation's economy and political structure should 
preclude a serious military Establishment. 
</P>
<P>
 Alluding to Haiti's border with the Dominican Republic and its long coastline 
as requiring some sort of defense force, U.S. Embassy spokesman Stanley 
Schrager gave the prevailing American view recently: "Our hope is to preserve 
the army as an institution . . . a smaller one and a more professional one. 
</P>
<P>
 "Besides," he continued, "there is the iconography of the institution. 
Countries think they need an army" as a symbol of nationhood. 
</P>
<P>
 The army officially has 7,000 soldiers, including 1,500 police, a figure that 
Aristide wants cut to about 1,500. U.S. sources say the total more likely will 
be about 3,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The purging is well under way. U.S. officers estimate that more than half of 
the soldiers have deserted and more are leaving. American troops have 
confiscated nearly every usable weapon, and all important orders are issued by 
U.S. commanders. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cedras' military had four generals," said a military planner. "For the new 
one, a colonel would probably do, but it may have one general for appearances' 
sake."

MEXICO REBELS HALT PEACE TALKS, DEFY GOVERNMENT; LATIN AMERICA: SALINAS SEEKS 
TO DEFUSE DISPUTE WITH ZAPATISTAS AMID FEARS OF RENEWED FIGHTING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The threat of renewed armed conflict loomed over this crisis-ridden nation 
Tuesday after Indian rebels in the southern state of Chiapas broke off peace 
talks with the government, mined roads to their jungle strongholds and said 
they had put up antiaircraft batteries to challenge the Mexican air force. 
</P>
<P>
 President Carlos Salinas de Gortari's government tried to defuse the conflict, 
renewing orders to the Mexican armed forces to fire only if fired upon by the 
rebels and launching a peace offensive that offered the Zapatista National 
Liberation Army new concessions. 
</P>
<P>
 But Roman Catholic Bishop Samuel Ruiz, who has acted as an intermediary in the 
nine months since the Zapatistas suspended a bloody insurrection that left more 
than 145 dead in the impoverished southern state in January, warned both sides 
that the showdown has "a transcendental gravity." 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts voiced concern that the Zapatistas, whose populist crusade for 
minority rights in Chiapas and throughout the south has been pushed to the 
margins by two recent political assassinations, escalating drug-related 
violence and deepening fears for personal safety, are preparing for a last, 
desperate act of war. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are trying to bring themselves back to life," said Homero Aridjis, a 
writer and social critic. "There is a real danger that the fighting will 
resume, given the climate of violence that has overtaken the nation, the bloody 
surrealism that we are living." 
</P>
<P>
 In a 10-point communique signed by Subcommander Marcos, the Zapatistas' 
black-masked leader, the group asserted that Mexican government forces were 
preparing for combat -- reinforcing positions around Zapatista-controlled 
towns, buzzing rebel positions with fighter planes and "ostensibly preparing 
for . . . an imminent attack." 
</P>
<P>
 Marcos accused Salinas' government of "deception" and operating "a criminal 
political culture" that lacks a genuine will to resolve the grievances that the 
Zapatistas and dozens of civilian activist groups supporting them say were 
behind the January uprising. 
</P>
<P>
 "Therefore, to respond to the provocations . . . Zapatista troops have 
completed mining all land access to rebel territory and already have installed 
antiaircraft units," the rebels said. There were no details or confirmation on 
how the poor, guerrilla force had acquired such heavy weapons as antiaircraft 
guns. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are ready," Marcos declared, adding, "The Zapatista National Liberation 
Army will not renew talks for a political solution to the conflict." 
</P>
<P>
 Responding to the latest in a series of crises that have marred his final year 
in office, Salinas denied that the Mexican army has plans for a military 
offensive. He called for immediate, direct talks with the Zapatista leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 The government also ordered the creation of an independent Truth Commission to 
address the Zapatistas' grievances in the months since the government declared 
a unilateral cease-fire after launching a series of military offensives to put 
down the insurrection. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is necessary to declare that the army has orders not to take any offensive 
military action and only to fire in self-defense if attacked," the government 
declared in its communique late Monday night. "This instruction will be 
complied with immediately." 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after the uprising began, a similar government peace effort quickly 
thwarted the growing support that the Zapatistas had enjoyed throughout Mexico. 
"The revolutionary mood of the country quickly evaporated," Aridjis said. "They 
are not likely to regain support from the rest of the country." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides revulsion at violence stemming from the political assassinations this 
year after decades of stability, he said, Mexicans are growing skeptical about 
the rebels. "The public is accustomed to empty threats from the Zapatistas," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, they threatened violence if they did not like the outcome of the 
Aug. 21 presidential election but did not return to arms then. 
</P>
<P>
 But Aridjis added that the months between the presidential election and the 
inauguration -- scheduled for Dec. 1 -- are traditionally a period of 
instability. That increases concern about the possible effects of a return to 
fighting in the south, especially considering other recent violence here. 
</P>
<P>
 The renewed confrontation with the Zapatistas came as the government and the 
ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party were still reeling from the second 
assassination of a key political leader in seven months. 
</P>
<P>
 Just hours after the Zapatistas issued the thinly veiled declaration of war, 
prosecutors attempting to untangle a conspiracy behind last month's 
assassination of the PRI's second-ranking official arrested a legislative aide 
suspected of helping mastermind the plot. 
</P>
<P>
 Fernando Rodriguez Gonzalez -- a technical secretary to a fugitive federal 
legislator also suspected in the plot in which Francisco Ruiz Massieu was 
killed -- was taken into custody late Monday by federal police in the Mexican 
state of Zacatecas. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said they were continuing their manhunt -- backed by a $1-million 
reward -- for Manuel Munoz Rocha, Rodriguez Gonzalez's boss and a ruling-party 
legislator who was reported to be in hiding in northern Mexico or in Texas. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the investigation into the Tijuana assassination in March of Luis 
Donaldo Colosio -- the ruling party candidate who had been expected to succeed 
Salinas -- the probe into Ruiz Massieu's slaying outside a downtown Mexico City 
hotel has grown far beyond a single, crazed gunman. 
</P>
<P>
 It is now suspected to be a conspiracy that may reach to the highest levels of 
the Mexican government and the party that has run it for 65 years; 10 suspects 
have been arrested since security agents at the murder scene tackled Daniel 
Aguilar Trevino, who later said he was paid $15,000 to kill the ruling-party 
official. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest assassination investigation, headed by the victim's brother, has 
exposed a web of intrigue. Assistant Atty. Gen. Mario Ruiz Massieu has said it 
involves either political vendettas between the party's reform factions and its 
Old Guard or political infiltration by Mexico's powerful drug gangs -- or a 
combination of the two. 
</P>
<P>
 Against the backdrop of continuing political violence within a party that 
narrowly won August's presidential and legislative elections on traditional 
promises of stability and security, the showdown with the Zapatistas served 
only to fuel national insecurity.

BOTH SIDES IN PAKISTAN STRIKE CLAIM VICTORY; ASIA: MANY BUSINESSES CLOSE FOR 
WORK STOPPAGE, BUT SUCCESS IS DIFFICULT TO GAUGE. 11 PEOPLE ARE KILLED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The Pakistani opposition's ambitious aim was to "jam" the nation's economy and 
force Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto from office. By the time Tuesday's strike 
ended, 11 people were reported dead and both sides were claiming victory. 
</P>
<P>
 The truth seemed somewhere in the middle. The one-day work stoppage called by 
former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif was only partly observed, but a preemptive 
crackdown by Bhutto failed to reassure many merchants and taxi, bus and truck 
drivers that they could conduct business as usual. 
</P>
<P>
 "The business community has observed the strike almost 100%," Sharif's press 
secretary, Muhammad Siddique-ul-Farooque, said by telephone from Islamabad, the 
capital of Pakistan. Public transportation, he said, was paralyzed "90%." 
</P>
<P>
 Nonsense, Bhutto's spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the objective was to bring everything to a halt and bring down the 
government, that has failed," Information Secretary Hussein Haqqani told the 
Reuters news agency. "If the objective was a massive show of public support, 
that has failed too." 
</P>
<P>
 The strike was the third one organized in the past month by Sharif and his 
Pakistan Muslim League, which on Sept. 11 launched an angry, high-volume 
offensive to topple Bhutto, who narrowly defeated Sharif at the polls in 
October, 1993, and to seek new elections. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday's action was given the colorful label "chakka jam" -- jamming the 
wheels of Pakistani trade and road and rail traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 In Karachi, the country's largest city and Bhutto's birthplace, the 
overwhelming majority of shops closed and most buses and taxis stayed off the 
streets, local journalist Zahid Hussain said. But that didn't mean residents 
necessarily agreed with Sharif's accusations that Bhutto has ruined the economy 
or betrayed the national interest in other ways. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the past year, four parties have called a strike, and each has been 
successful in Karachi," Hussain said. "Most public transport goes off the road 
from fear." 
</P>
<P>
 In one positive development for Bhutto, one powerful Karachi-based party 
remained neutral, Hussain said. And in Lahore, Sharif's political power base, 
the "wheel jam" was only partly successful, said Javed Syed, reporter for the 
English-language newspaper the Nation. 
</P>
<P>
 "About 50% of the vehicles are plying the road," Syed said at midafternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 The urban shopkeeper class, who view Bhutto as the covert champion of the 
Pakistani landholding gentry she was born into, is the bedrock of Sharif's 
constituency. So predictably, most Lahore stores closed, Syed said. But not 
all. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not as successful as the two previous strikes," he said. On Sept. 29, 
the Lahore journalist said, the fashionable Liberty Market had been shut 
completely. On Tuesday, about a dozen stores remained open. 
</P>
<P>
 However, news reports made it clear that Bhutto's antidotes to the strike, 
such as running some buses under police escort, were also only partly 
successful. Throughout Pakistan, many people stayed away from factories, 
bazaars, banks and schools Tuesday for fear of being attacked by Sharif 
loyalists. 
</P>
<P>
 In the days before the "wheel jam," the government also detained more than 
1,000 opposition leaders. Sharif's spokesman said the actual number arrested or 
confined to their homes was 20,000. One was the former prime minister, who had 
planned to lead the strike in the industrial city of Rawalpindi. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Siddique-ul-Farooque reported, Sharif spent Tuesday "under undeclared 
house arrest" in Lahore. 
</P>
<P>
 In the same city, news reports said, supporters of Bhutto's Pakistan People's 
Party riding on top of a bus during an anti-PML demonstration were knocked off 
as the vehicle drove under a bridge. Five were killed instantly and two others 
died in the hospital, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 About 50 miles north of Lahore, in the town of Gujranwala, PML activists on a 
rooftop showered police with rocks. When police fired tear gas, one protester 
reportedly fell and was killed. 
</P>
<P>
 In Gujrat in eastern Punjab, police shot up the residence of a Muslim League 
senator, killing one opposition party worker and wounding five others, the PML 
said. Punjabi officials corroborated the death. 
</P>
<P>
 In Charsaddah in North-West Frontier Province, police said opposition 
supporters fired on a bus, killing two people and wounding at least eight other 
passengers.

FATHERS CONFRONT GANG MEMBERS WHO RAPED AND KILLED DAUGHTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Over objections from defense lawyers, two grieving fathers lashed out in court 
Tuesday at the gang members who raped and killed their teen-age daughters. 
</P>
<P>
 "We live for the day that you die," a tearful Randy Ertman said after the 
three defendants were sentenced to death."You are baby killers." 
</P>
<P>
 As the last of the three was being led from the packed courtroom, Ertman told 
him, "I'll watch you die, boy." 
</P>
<P>
 The fathers were allowed to confront their daughters' killers under a Texas 
law that allows victims or their surviving relatives to speak at sentencing. 
</P>
<P>
 The fathers berated the defendants even though they were told to be civil and 
to speak to the judges instead. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point Ertman said: "You are worse than spit. You belong in hell." 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, Efrain Perez, 18, Raul Villarreal, 18, and Joe Medellin, 19, 
showed no emotion during the fathers' speeches. They were convicted last month. 
</P>
<P>
 Two other gang members, Peter Cantu and Derrick Sean O'Brien, both 19, had 
already been sentenced to death in the case. A sixth defendant, Vinny Medellin, 
15, got 40 years because he is a juvenile. 
</P>
<P>
 While taking a shortcut home from a party about 11:30 p.m. on June 24, 1993, 
Jennifer Ertman, 14, and Elizabeth Pena, 16, came upon six gang members 
drinking and holding a gang initiation. The gang members grabbed the girls and 
took turns raping them for an hour before killing them. The bodies were found 
four days later.

U.S. RECOVERS $1.09 BILLION IN MEDICAL, DEFENSE FRAUD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RONALD J. OSTROW, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Spurred by recoveries in health care fraud cases, the government collected a 
record $1.09 billion in civil settlements and judgments in fiscal 1994, nearly 
three times more than the year before, the previous high. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense procurement fraud pay-backs of $578 million, led by cases in which 
whistle-blowers sued contractors in the name of the government, constituted the 
biggest category of recoveries, the Justice Department said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 But health care fraud -- reflecting an unprecedented $324-million settlement 
with a psychiatric hospital chain for allegedly overcharging Medicare, Medicaid 
and other federal health programs -- generated $411 million, the second-largest 
category. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want the word to get out -- that persons, entities, companies are not 
going to be permitted to cheat the taxpayers of this country and get away with 
it," Frank W. Hunger, assistant attorney general for the department's civil 
division, told a press conference. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whether a Fortune 500 defense contractor delivers substandard equipment, or a 
large health care supplier lies about its costs to obtain inflated federal 
reimbursement, or a doctor falsifies a diagnosis to get paid by Medicare, or a 
businessman lies on an application for federal funds, we will seek to recover 
every dime and more on behalf of the taxpayers," Hunger said. 
</P>
<P>
 The $1.09 billion in civil recoveries topped the $900 million that the 
government obtained in criminal fines and forfeitures last year. 
</P>
<P>
 The largest element in the health care fraud recovery was the $324-million 
settlement from National Medical Enterprises Inc., a multinational corporation 
that owns a nationwide chain of psychiatric hospitals and substance abuse 
facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 The alleged fraudulent practices at the firm's facilities included admitting 
and treating patients unnecessarily, keeping patients hospitalized longer than 
necessary to use available hospital insurance, billing insurance programs 
multiple times for the same service, billing when no service was provided and 
billing Medicare for payments made to doctors and others that were intended 
solely to induce referrals of patients.

COLORADO COURT VOIDS ANTI-GAY AMENDMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The anti-gay rights amendment that set off a nationwide boycott of Colorado 
was declared unconstitutional Tuesday by the state Supreme Court, which said it 
denies homosexuals an equal voice in government. 
</P>
<P>
 State Atty. Gen. Gale Norton said she will appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
 Adopted by the state's voters in 1992, the amendment prohibited local 
governments from outlawing discrimination against homosexuals. 
</P>
<P>
 "The right to participate equally in the political process is clearly affected 
by Amendment 2," Chief Justice Luis Rovira wrote for the court's 6-1 majority. 
</P>
<P>
 The amendment "singles out one form of discrimination and removes its redress 
from consideration by the normal political process," Rovira said. 
</P>
<P>
 Amendment 2, which would have struck down anti-discrimination ordinances in 
Denver, Boulder and Aspen, has never been enforced. It was challenged 
immediately after its passage and has been the subject of court battles since 
then. 
</P>
<P>
 It was written by Colorado for Family Values founder Will Perkins and 
approved, 54% to 46%, by voters in the 1992 election. 
</P>
<P>
 After its passage, gay-rights activists launched a nationwide boycott of 
Colorado's tourism industry that they said cost about $120 million in lost 
convention business. State officials put the figure at about $40 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "This ruling is a decisive affirmation of lesbian and gay rights, and a 
crushing blow to the radical right's efforts to curtail important 
constitutional protections," said Suzanne B. Goldberg, an attorney at the 
gay-rights organization Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund and a 
co-counsel in the case. Tuesday's decision upholds a ruling last year by 
District Judge Jeffrey Bayless. 
</P>
<P>
 The high court ruled that Amendment 2 "alters the political process so that a 
targeted class is prohibited from obtaining legislative, executive and judicial 
protection or redress from discrimination, absent the consent of the majority 
of the electorate."

PAPER PIERCES NOBEL SECRECY, SAYS RABIN, ARAFAT TO GET PRIZE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Times Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The traditional secrecy around the Nobel Peace Prize was torn Tuesday, just 
days before the award announcement, when a newspaper reported a bitter dispute 
over the choice of Yasser Arafat as co-winner. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oslo newspaper Aftenposten reported that the PLO chairman and Israeli 
Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin would be announced as winners Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 And the newspaper said a committee member, Kaare Kristiansen, who has labeled 
Arafat a terrorist, would resign if the Palestinian leader shares the $933,000 
prize. 
</P>
<P>
 Rabin and Arafat have been mentioned for months as likely winners for the 
historic treaty they signed last year. 
</P>
<P>
 But the bald disclosure of the names and glimpses at behind-the-scenes 
bickering were rare. There have been leaks in past years to Norwegian media, 
but the news wasn't reported with such certainty. 
</P>
<P>
 Kristiansen and others involved in this year's Peace Prize refused to confirm 
or deny the newspaper's report, though one source who refused to be identified 
told Reuters news service that it was accurate. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the newspaper, the award committee still had time to meet and 
change its mind, although the paper said that appeared unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
 Kristiansen is a former Christian Democratic politician and a longtime friend 
of Israel. Asked whether his reputation for disliking Arafat was correct, 
Kristiansen said: "That's right."

ISRAEL-SYRIA PACT LOOKS LIKELY, CHRISTOPHER SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NORMAN KEMPSTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Using some of the most upbeat language he has ever applied to the knotty 
negotiations between Syria and Israel, U.S. Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher said Tuesday that he is increasingly hopeful that the bitter 
enemies are closing in on a comprehensive peace agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are moving in the right direction," Christopher told reporters after 
meeting for almost four hours with Syrian President Hafez Assad to relay 
negotiating points he picked up the day before from Israeli Prime Minister 
Yitzhak Rabin. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the parties are determined to try to achieve a comprehensive peace 
and there is hope that can be achieved," he said. "I am more convinced than 
ever of the seriousness of both President Assad . . . and Prime Minister 
Rabin." 
</P>
<P>
 After a detour to Kuwait today to assure the emirate's leaders and officials 
of the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council of U.S. determination to prevent 
Iraq from renewing aggression against Kuwait, Christopher will return to 
Jerusalem tonight to report to Rabin and will meet again with Assad on Thursday 
before heading home Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite Christopher's optimistic account, Israel and Syria have not begun the 
sort of face-to-face negotiations that U.S. officials believe will be needed to 
nail down a peace treaty ending almost half a century of icy hostility, 
intermittent armed skirmishes and two major wars. All of the bargaining is 
being done through American go-betweens. 
</P>
<P>
 A senior State Department official, who attended the Christopher-Assad talks, 
said none of the troublesome issues dividing the parties has yet been 
completely resolved and "in the end, if it doesn't fit together, it doesn't 
amount to anything." 
</P>
<P>
 But he made it clear that the gap has been narrowed on at least some of the 
points of disagreement. Neither the official nor Christopher would discuss any 
of the details. 
</P>
<P>
 The senior official said both Rabin and Assad are now asking detailed 
questions about the position of the other, a sharp change from an earlier stage 
of the talks in which each side stated and restated its own position. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have begun to look at issues to find where there might be a basis for 
common ground," the official said. "We brought some things here . . . and we 
are going to take some things back." 
</P>
<P>
 Israel and Syria have agreed in principle that any pact will involve a "land 
for peace" swap in which Israel will return to Syria some or all of the Golan 
Heights in exchange for peaceful relations. But there are still wide gaps 
between the two countries on such issues as the speed and extent of Israeli 
withdrawal, the nature of the peace and new arrangements to guarantee the 
security of both countries. 
</P>
<P>
 The senior official said the negotiating pace is slow and deliberate because 
Rabin and Assad "are the kind of people that, if they are going to do a deal, 
they want everything very clearly understood." 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher also said Assad assured him that Syria strongly supports U.S 
military measures intended to prevent Iraq from repeating its 1990 invasion of 
Kuwait. Syria sent troops to the U.S-led international force that thwarted the 
earlier Iraqi aggression. 
</P>
<P>
 Following his talks with Assad, Christopher flew to Amman, where he won a 
ringing endorsement from King Hussein of Jordan for U.S. efforts to head off an 
Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. After the news conference, Christopher aides said the 
king's reaction was much stronger than they had anticipated before the 
secretary of state and the monarch met over dinner at the royal palace. 
</P>
<P>
 Hussein expressed "very deep sadness, disappointment and anger" at the Iraqi 
troop movements, which he said will undermine any chance Iraq may have had to 
obtain relief from the United Nations' economic sanctions. He said Iraqi 
President Saddam Hussein's maneuver was "totally irresponsible." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the king insisted that his nation never supported Iraq's 1990 
invasion of Kuwait, Amman was widely regarded as sympathetic to Baghdad. 
</P>
<P>
 Iraq was then able to circumvent a U.N.-imposed embargo, largely with 
Jordanian complicity. This time, however, the king said his country would 
"stand in the face of" Iraqi aggression.

WARY DEMOCRATS ARE SEEN STEERING CLEAR OF BLACK VOTERS; ELECTIONS: ANALYSTS SAY 
TREND IS DRIVEN BY FEAR OF SEEMING TO CURRY FAVOR AMID CONSERVATIVE CLIMATE. 
CRITICS WARN THE TACTIC COULD COST PARTY VICTORIES.

<P>
 Viewed from afar and with pragmatism, the intersection of 55th and Vine 
streets in the western reaches of this city is a political no-man's land. 
</P>
<P>
 A two-story housing development crouching at the urban junction warehouses 
families who live feebly on public assistance and beyond the glad-handing of 
politicians. Nearly everyone in sight -- the single women with infants and the 
young men in baggy pants who heckle passing cars -- seems young, hopeless and 
African American, a demographic slice that many politicians write off as 
unlikely to turn out on Election Day. 
</P>
<P>
 The poor -- black and white, alike -- are often overlooked as potential 
voters, considered not worth the effort required to ask for their votes. But 
political analysts said that in this year's conservative political climate, 
Democratic candidates are so fearful of seeming to curry favor with poor, 
inner-city and welfare-dependent blacks that they are avoiding direct campaign 
pitches to all black voters. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody's been here to tell me why I should vote," said Constance Williams, 
24, who said that she lives in an apartment near the intersection. "I'd be 
interested if someone was interested in me. But, far as I can tell, nobody 
cares. So why should I?" 
</P>
<P>
 If fear of seeming to be aligned with Williams and others like her prevents 
Democrats from seeking black votes, the result may lead to lower black turnout 
overall -- a potentially fatal development for nearly every Democratic 
candidate. 
</P>
<P>
 Furthermore, political analysts said, Democratic congressional and 
gubernatorial candidates might avoid potential midterm losses if they stopped 
running away from the broad support of African Americans, whom numerous 
pollsters identify as among the party's most loyal supporters. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, here in Pennsylvania as in other states where Democrats are waging 
hand-to-hand combat with Republican challengers, high black turnout could 
provide the winning edge for Democrats. But local and national observers said 
that the Democratic Party is doing little to motivate blacks to participate in 
large enough numbers to make a difference. Instead, the party is courting 
segments of the white voting population that has been turning away from the 
Democratic message of big government. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a lot of concern about the flight of white male voters out of our 
party but that overlooks the fact that there is a significant African American 
vote out there that's being ignored," said state Sen. Chaka Fattah, Democratic 
nominee for a House seat from Pennsylvania's 2nd Congressional District, which 
includes most of Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
 Fattah is virtually assured of winning his race over Republican Lawrence R. 
Watson, who is running uphill in a district where Democrats comprise 81% of 
registered voters. Yet he is concerned about the impact of low black voter 
turnout on the election chances of other Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just don't see enough emphasis within the party on building enthusiasm 
within the African American community," Fattah said. 
</P>
<P>
 Others are equally distressed by the failure of Democrats to campaign 
aggressively in black neighborhoods across the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 David Bositis, senior political analyst at the Washington-based Joint Center 
for Political and Economic Studies, said that as he has focused on races across 
the nation he has heard black political workers complain that Democratic Party 
leaders have not given them the resources needed to get black voters to the 
polls. 
</P>
<P>
 He added that contrary to media and political talk of a unified black vote, 
"the black vote, such as it is, is not a national vote" because large numbers 
of black voters are concentrated in 21 or 22 states. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've heard complaints from New York, where there is the largest number of 
black voters, that they're being ignored," said Bositis. "The same can be said 
of California, where percentage-wise, blacks are a small number but an 
important element because they tend to vote at a greater rate than other 
minority groups. The black votes in Texas and Florida are keys to those races, 
but little is being done to court them." 
</P>
<P>
 A Democratic National Committee official in Washington said that the party 
supports all Democratic candidates and values black voters. But he acknowledged 
that it is unlikely the party will make national campaign pitches exclusively 
to blacks. 
</P>
<P>
 Party Chairman David Wilhelm had proposed that the party spend a relatively 
large amount to purchase advertisements on black and Latino radio stations in 
an attempt to boost minority turnout. But the White House prefers to use the 
money for a national television campaign touting Clinton's record, a senior 
party official said. 
</P>
<P>
 The White House view seems to be influenced by some Democratic pollsters who 
have argued that black turnout should not be the party's primary focus this 
year. Instead, they have said, it should concentrate on wooing white voters -- 
particularly lower-income, older, working-class whites, who have been turned 
off by Clinton's performance. 
</P>
<P>
 Not everyone shares that view. Curtis Gans, director of the Committee for the 
Study of the American Electorate in Washington, said that -- while turnout in 
midterm elections tends to be smaller for all demographic groups -- African 
Americans appear less likely to vote than in previous midterm elections. 
</P>
<P>
 "There (is) a low level of interest and inclination to vote among black voters 
this time around," Gans said. "It seems that little in public policy has 
reached the black community and the national (Democratic) emphasis has been on 
middle-class concerns and trade issues. Those don't translate well as issues of 
concern to the black community." 
</P>
<P>
 Nationally, the Democrats continue to have overwhelming support among blacks. 
But that support will not translate into votes if blacks refuse to go to the 
polls. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the states where Democratic senators and governors have been targeted by 
the national Republican Party as extremely vulnerable or in tight races, the 
black vote could be critical," said Sonia Jarvis, a political science professor 
at the National Center for Communication Studies at George Washington 
University in Washington. "But only if black voters turn out. We're talking 
about basic math." 
</P>
<P>
 James Ferguson, executive director of the National Coalition on Black Voter 
Participation, a nonpartisan group that advises grass-roots groups on political 
organizing, said that the Democratic tactic of soliciting white voters and 
ignoring black voters would at best satisfy only the short-term needs of the 
White House, while alienating black voters already strongly predisposed toward 
the Democratic Party. 
</P>
<P>
 "If (black voters) are not motivated and don't vote now, it only makes it all 
the more difficult to get them to come back later," Ferguson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pennsylvania, a state with a history of liberal Democrats and moderate 
Republican candidates, is a textbook example of what worries analysts who track 
voting patterns among black Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 According to a Philadelphia Daily News/KYW-TV Keystone Poll released last 
week, Democrat Mark Singel holds a slim 3-percentage-point advantage over 
Republican Tom Ridge in the gubernatorial race for the seat being vacated by 
Democrat Robert P. Casey. Of the 569 adult Pennsylvanians surveyed as likely 
voters in the Nov. 8 election, 38% said that they prefer Singel and 35% named 
Ridge. 
</P>
<P>
 The Senate race is even tighter, as incumbent Sen. Harris Wofford and his 
Republican challenger, Rep. Rick Santorum, each had 38% support in the poll. 
The poll had a 4-point margin of error, rendering both contests too close to 
call. 
</P>
<P>
 "It should be obvious to anyone in the Democratic Party in this state that 
whether the black vote goes to the polls will be the essential ingredient for 
victory," Fattah said. 
</P>
<P>
 Alexander Talmadge, who is the only black on the three-member Philadelphia 
City Commission, said that Fattah's campaign is the drawing card for black 
voter participation in Philadelphia. And, he said, it appears that the Singel 
and Wofford campaigns -- operating under a shared Democratic banner, called 
Victory '94 -- are relying on Fattah's organization to get out the black vote. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not going to be like it was when Clinton was running for President in 
1992," Talmadge said. "There won't be that kind of black turnout. No way."

GORE CALLS NORTH UNPATRIOTIC IN DOUBTING U.S. READINESS ON IRAQ 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Wading into Virginia's testy Senate race, the White House said Tuesday that 
Oliver L. North was "giving aid and comfort" to Saddam Hussein by suggesting 
U.S. forces could not stop an Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is despicable, it is unpatriotic and as is often the case with statements 
from Oliver North, it is also patently untrue," Vice President Al Gore said."He 
has put the rankest form of partisanship ahead of the national interest in a 
manner which is insulting to our armed forces, to our flag, to the soldiers who 
are prepared to go into battle if necessary." 
</P>
<P>
 North did not offer the apology Gore demanded. Instead, he said that "it is 
shameful and opportunistic that a White House would use an international 
crisis, where American lives are at stake, to promote their own selfish, 
political agenda." 
</P>
<P>
 North, who is in a tight race with Democratic Sen. Charles S. Robb, got some 
help from Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.), who said Clinton's defense 
cuts had undermined U.S. readiness. 
</P>
<P>
 But GOP Sen. John W. Warner, who also represents Virginia but calls North 
unfit for office, countered that defense spending is at levels recommended by 
former President George Bush.

MICHIGAN LESS THAN DAZZLED BY CLINTON; CAMPAIGN: THE PRESIDENT ASKS VOTERS TO 
REMEMBER PROGRESS MADE SINCE HE'S BEEN IN OFFICE. BUT AUTO WORKERS APPEAR 
UNEXCITED AT RALLY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Greeted by an unexcited crowd and avoided by unenthusiastic fellow Democrats, 
President Clinton brought his campaign message to one of the fall election's 
most important battlegrounds Tuesday, telling voters that they face a choice 
between the future and the past. 
</P>
<P>
 "I ask every American in the next four weeks not just to think of their 
discontents with the political system, although there's plenty (of) good reason 
to be discontented, but to remember the problems we found 20 months ago," 
Clinton said. "Remember the progress we're making. Remember how many of them 
(Republicans) fought us every step of the way. And remember now what they want 
to do to take us back when we have so much to do to keep going forward." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton provided his listeners a lengthy account of what he had achieved in 
Washington so far -- from the Family Leave Act to a sharply reduced federal 
deficit -- and claimed credit for the improving economy that has created 4.6 
million jobs in 20 months. And in keeping with the image he and his strategists 
wish to present, he used the word "fight" or a variant 14 times in a 20-minute 
speech. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our strategy," he said, is "fighting for the future." Republicans, he 
insisted, offer a path that goes "back to the 1980s, to trickle-down 
economics." 
</P>
<P>
 But if Clinton's goal was to fire up a traditionally Democratic crowd, the 
attempt fell flat. Ford shut down its Mustang assembly line for three hours for 
Clinton, freeing several hundred auto workers to stand outside in a massive 
parking lot and listen to him speak. The crowd laughed at a few of Clinton's 
jokes, applauded some of his punch lines, but mostly listened in silence -- not 
hostile, just not apparently particularly interested. 
</P>
<P>
 Precisely the same might be said of the larger electorate here and in the 
surrounding counties, where Democrats must win large margins to counter the 
heavily Republican areas elsewhere in the state. With the state always closely 
divided between the two parties, the results here are a good bellwether of how 
the national picture is likely to turn out on Election Day. 
</P>
<P>
 Democrats outnumber Republicans in Michigan, but their voters traditionally 
turn out at a lower rate, according to pollster Ed Sarpolus. So far this year, 
with Democrats demoralized and Republicans fired up, the partisan gap could 
close to seven percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
 Although black voters seem likely to turn out at their usual rate, older, 
conservative white Democrats in Detroit's suburbs are telling pollsters that 
they plan to stay home -- a prospect that could sink Democratic candidates by 
the boatload. Five of the 10 congressional seats now held by Michigan Democrats 
are in jeopardy, as is the Democratic Senate seat being vacated by Donald W. 
Riegle Jr., who is retiring. What happens in those Senate and House contests 
will go far toward determining whether next month's election is merely a bad 
day for Clinton and his party or a disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton is not as wildly unpopular here as he is, for example, in many 
Southern states. A Sarpolus poll released by the Detroit Free Press Tuesday 
shows the state's voters almost evenly split on their attitudes toward the 
President -- 50% unfavorable and 46% favorable. But here as elsewhere, the 
opponents have a clear edge on intensity and the GOP is "milking that 
anti-Clinton feeling for all it's worth," said Bill Ballinger, publisher of a 
newsletter on Michigan politics. The state's Republican campaign committees 
have even begun running ads trying to tie state legislative candidates to the 
President, he noted. 
</P>
<P>
 So far the Republican approach appears to be prevailing, at least in the 
Senate contest, which the GOP almost certainly must win if the party is to 
capture control of the chamber. Both candidates -- Republican Spencer Abraham, 
a former party official and aide to Vice President Dan Quayle, and Democratic 
Rep. Bob Carr, who represents the Lansing area -- are little known statewide, 
and neither has generated much excitement among voters. But Abraham holds a 
narrow lead -- 43% to 38% in the Free Press poll -- that largely seems to 
reflect voters' desire so far to choose a generic Republican name over a 
Democratic one. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither candidate has made a point of party identity. Abraham tells voters 
that his father was a Democrat. Carr points out that his parents "were both 
Republicans until they died."

2 DIE IN CRASH OF CAR FLEEING BORDER PATROL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 Two people died and 11 were injured in a crash Tuesday when a car packed with 
illegal immigrants and driven by a suspected smuggler ran a red light while 
trying to elude the Border Patrol near the U.S.-Mexico boundary, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The crash killed a woman and a boy who were among 11 suspected illegal 
immigrants riding in a two-door Ford Granada, four of them in the trunk, police 
said. The dead were not identified. Four of the injured remained hospitalized 
in critical condition at UC San Diego Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 The driver of the Ford, 40-year-old Bartolo Martinez Vargas of Tijuana, was 
trying to escape a Border Patrol sedan that had just pulled out of a side road 
behind him, authorities said. The Border Patrol agent suspected the heavily 
loaded car was involved in immigrant smuggling, but there was no pursuit before 
the collision, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Border Patrol was following and positioning themselves to run the license 
plate," said Bill Robinson, a spokesman for the San Diego police. "The driver 
saw the Border Patrol vehicle behind him and apparently panicked." 
</P>
<P>
 The Ford drove the wrong way around traffic stopped at the red light and onto 
a four-lane highway, where it was struck by two cars going about 50 m.p.h., 
police said. The drivers of those two cars were among the injured. 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez faces charges of manslaughter and is also being investigated by the 
Border Patrol's anti-smuggling unit, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The crash occurred about 7:30 a.m. in an intersection a few blocks north of 
the border in the Otay Mesa section of southeastern San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the crash took place during the second week of Operation Gatekeeper 
-- a crackdown in which the Border Patrol has flooded the San Diego line with 
agents -- it fits the pattern of previous cases that involved reckless driving 
by smugglers in overloaded vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, six people died after a Border Patrol chase in which a stolen van 
carrying a dozen illegal immigrants crashed in front of a high school in 
Temecula.

JURY FINDS MAN GUILTY OF MURDERS; COURT: DEFENSE ARGUMENT THAT DOUGLAS 
FREDERICK STANLEY SUFFERED AMNESIA FAILS. HIS SISTER-IN-LAW AND A CO-WORKER 
WERE GUNNED DOWN AT A FOUNTAIN VALLEY EMBROIDERY SHOP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A Superior Court jury convicted a Westminster man of two counts of 
first-degree murder Tuesday, rejecting arguments that because he suffered a 
form of amnesia he could not have planned to kill his sister-in-law and another 
woman. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The announcement of the verdict against Douglas Frederick Stanley brought 
tears and cries of relief in the courtroom from the family and friends of 
victims Joyce Stanley and Terry Vasquez. The women were gunned down July 8, 
1993, at a Fountain Valley embroidery shop owned by Joyce and Charles Stanley, 
the defendant's brother. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside the courtroom, family members shared hugs and tears with jurors, 
thanking them for their work. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are just happy that (jury members) were hearing the truth," said Pamela 
Harrington, the daughter of Joyce Stanley. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our prayers were answered," added Jan Watson, Joyce Stanley's sister. "We all 
know it was premeditated. For anything less . . . it wouldn't have been 
justice." 
</P>
<P>
 Douglas Stanley, 58, faces life in prison without the possibility of parole 
when he is sentenced Nov. 4 by Judge David O. Carter. The jury deliberated less 
than five hours last week before finding the former ranch hand guilty of two 
counts of first-degree murder with a special-circumstance allegation of 
multiple murder. Several jurors declined to answer a reporter's questions about 
the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors had decided before the trial not to seek the death penalty against 
Douglas Stanley. 
</P>
<P>
 The jury also found Douglas Stanley guilty of using a firearm and stealing his 
sister-in-law's car, in which he fled to Colorado following the shootings, 
sparking a nationwide manhunt. He was captured July 11, after a gun fell out of 
one of his pants legs while he was being questioned by a Colorado state trooper 
at a roadside stop. 
</P>
<P>
 The jury reached the verdict Friday, but it was sealed until Tuesday morning, 
when attorneys in the case were available. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutor Robert Molko contended during the 15-day trial that Douglas Stanley 
plotted the killing because of longstanding grudges he held against Joyce 
Stanley, 52, and Vasquez, 41. Douglas Stanley, who worked with both women, 
blamed his sister-in-law for his estrangement from his daughter and did not 
like having the two women as his supervisors at the business, Molko said. 
</P>
<P>
 Douglas Stanley also boasted to a friend shortly before the killings that he 
was finally about to get his revenge. He withdrew a large sum of money from his 
own bank account, Molko said during the trial. 
</P>
<P>
 But Joyce Stanley had nursed the defendant back to health after he had heart 
bypass surgery about a year before the killing and was constantly urging him to 
take care of himself, Molko said. 
</P>
<P>
 Douglas Stanley's attorney, Deputy Public Defender Denise Gragg, contended 
that on the day of the shooting her client was suffering "transient global 
amnesia," essentially a stroke-induced blackout, triggered by stress and a bad 
heart. 
</P>
<P>
 Gragg told jurors during the trial that Douglas Stanley could not have 
premeditated the killings -- a factor necessary to convict him of first-degree 
murder -- because the brain damage he was suffering rendered him unaware of his 
actions. She said he only snapped out of the trance-like state when he found 
himself driving his sister-in-law's car in Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
 Gragg said Tuesday she was disappointed with the verdict, but added that she 
and Douglas Stanley had anticipated it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the evidence showed he had brain damage, which caused him to go off," 
Gragg said. She acknowledged, however, that such a defense is generally 
unpopular with jurors. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very difficult for him to realize what he did because he has no present 
memory of it," she said. "This is a very sad story all the way around."

RILEY BACKS OFF PLAN TO RAISE PAY HIKE ISSUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATT LAIT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sensing a lack of support from fellow supervisors, Board Chairman Thomas F. 
Riley on Tuesday backed off earlier statements and said he will not ask his 
colleagues to consider giving themselves a pay raise. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel it is warranted, and I would have to assume that others feel they 
deserve it too, but I'm not going to do it unless there is absolute unanimity, 
and it doesn't appear there is," said Riley, who is retiring in December. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, Riley said he was considering proposing that members give 
themselves a 2.5% pay hike because the supervisors have gone nearly four years 
without a raise. But none of the four other supervisors publicly embraced his 
proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would bring it up, but don't want to get involved in causing a problem," he 
said. Currently, the supervisors earn $82,056 a year in salary, plus another 
$15,000 in extra pay and benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, the board approved a county budget that provided for 2.5% to 3.5% 
pay raises for about 16,000 county employees. The board next week is expected 
to discuss similar raises for all management and executive management 
positions, including elected officials. 
</P>
<P>
 County administrators and department heads have gone without a salary increase 
for three years. Even though the supervisors have gone for a longer period 
without a raise, board members said it would be inappropriate to award 
themselves a pay hike during the county's current economic woes. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's not going to fly," said Supervisor Roger R. Stanton of the pay raise 
issue. "That doesn't mean in a good year the supervisors shouldn't have an 
adjustment, but this hasn't been a good year. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no indication that things are getting better. You've got to reflect 
the up and down of your constituency and right now it's a real downer for the 
people of Orange County," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor William G. Steiner agreed. "These still are not very economically 
strong times for the county," he said. A raise for the supervisors "is not 
something that I've been pushing. I feel we need to exercise a lot of caution" 
economically. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez also said he thought it was not the right time for 
a supervisor raise. "I had no intention of supporting a pay raise at any time," 
he said. "I expressed that to my colleagues very early on. . . . We're still in 
a time of an uncertain economy and restraint is probably the best order of 
day." 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Harriett M. Wieder, who was seeing a doctor about lower back pain, 
could not be reached for comment.

NEW TASK FORCE REVERSES TIDE OF AUTO THEFTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBBIE KONG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In its first year of operation, a special task force created to put a dent in 
organized auto thefts recovered 251 stolen vehicles worth an estimated $3 
million and arrested nearly 90 people, according to a report issued by the 
district attorney's office Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County Auto Theft Task Force, which includes county prosecutors, 
California Highway Patrol officers, FBI agents and local police, is being 
credited with an overall reduction in auto thefts of about 7.8%, or 814 
vehicles, from the previous year. The reduction marks the first decline in a 
10-year trend of skyrocketing auto thefts, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 With Orange County accounting for about 10%, or 20,216 vehicles, of 
California's auto thefts in 1993, the task force has saved citizens "a 
tremendous amount of money in loss and stolen goods," Garden Grove Police Chief 
Stanley L. Knee, a task force member, said. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you take down these organizations . . . we are actually a safer 
community because of it," Knee said. 
</P>
<P>
 Funded by a $1 fee from each vehicle registered in the county, the task force 
began with a budget of $1.8 million, said Loren Duchesne, the task force's 
executive board chairman. Its mission is to "identify, apprehend and prosecute 
professional vehicle thieves," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The task force has made 88 arrests, 13 that resulted in state prison sentences 
averaging three years, and investigated 92 businesses for possible "chop shop" 
activities, where mechanics illegally switch serial numbers to prepare cars for 
resale or dismantle them for parts. Like its Los Angeles County counterpart, 
the task force is only a year old. San Diego County's program, the first in the 
state, is 2 years old. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those arrested by the Orange County task force were two men in November, 
1993, who hijacked meat trucks at gunpoint and sold the meat and vehicles. The 
two were charged with kidnaping for the purpose of robbery, according to the 
task force report. 
</P>
<P>
 In a Fountain Valley case, task force members recovered 42 cars worth a total 
of about $672,000, the report said. No arrests have been made pending the 
completion of the investigation, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Duchesne said the Orange County task force is also developing a computerized 
system that would allow investigators countywide to track where cars are being 
stolen and other pertinent details, such as the vehicle's model, time and date 
of theft and location of recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 Task force officials said a state Senate bill that created the anti-auto theft 
program is up for review next year. Under a sunset clause, the program will be 
terminated Dec. 31, 1995, unless SB-2139 is extended by the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am deeply concerned the . . . law will not be renewed and we will not be 
able to continue," Knee said. 
</P>
<P>
 The task force provides a valuable resource for police departments with 
limited budgets, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Auto theft was out of control," Knee said. "Local law enforcement were faced 
with many more problems than we could handle, with the rise in gangs and 
violent crimes." He added that funds from police departments' auto theft 
budgets were often used in other areas of law enforcement. In the first six 
months of the task force's existence, Garden Grove's auto theft decreased 18%, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to keep building on the expertise we have established," said Santa 
Ana Police Chief Paul M. Walters, also a task force member. "Southern 
California has so many cars that it's natural for a career criminal to target. 
They just don't stay in one county. That's why coordination is so important." 
Fewer Auto Thefts In its first year, the Orange County Auto Theft Task Force 
recovered 251 vehicles worth $3 million. Forming the special force are local 
police, the Orange County district attorney's office, the California Highway 
Patrol, the California Department of Motor Vehicles, the FBI and the National 
Insurance Crime Bureau. *

<P>
 Program Effect Vehicle thefts in the county have declined since the task force 
began work in July, 1993: July-Dec. 1992: 10, 417 Jan-June 1993: 10,520 
July-Dec. 1993: 9,696 Jan.-June 1994: 9,613 *

THE SPIN / BILL BOYARSKY: ITO'S LAW: KEEPING CONTROL OF COURTROOM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BOYARSKY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Welcome to Superior Court Judge Lance A. Ito's world of no-comfort journalism. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge has created a Spartan work space for the more than 100 reporters 
covering selection of a jury for O.J. Simpson's murder trial. When Ito and the 
lawyers resume questioning prospective jurors today, the journalists will crowd 
into four rooms, one 12-by-16 feet and the others even smaller. 
</P>
<P>
 Only five pool reporters are allowed into the courtroom during selection. So 
the rest must be confined to the four rooms if they want to hear the audio 
feed. 
</P>
<P>
 Because there's no furniture, they'll have to either sit on the floor or bring 
in their own folding chairs. The room has no phone lines, so reporters will 
have to pack their laptop computers to another room to file stories. Metal 
detectors will be installed to make sure the reporters are not carrying tape 
recorders or cellular phones. That's necessary to assure obedience to a State 
Judicial Council rule against photographing jurors or recording or broadcasting 
what they say. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the judge has been mad at the press lately for printing various 
scoops, leaks and mistakes, this uncomfortable arrangement isn't Ito's revenge. 
Rather, it's a graphic example of how he is constantly walking the line between 
assuring an open trial, guaranteeing Simpson a fair hearing in court and 
protecting the jurors. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday morning, I watched Ito visit the press quarters on the 12th floor of 
the Criminal Courts Building to check the quality of the sound coming from his 
courtroom, three floors below. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 He'd taken off his black judicial robe and was wearing a blue suit. He carried 
a stenographer's notebook. Television crews crowded around him, and a soundman 
accidentally brushed the top of Ito's head with a boom microphone. That drew a 
chuckle from Ito, his only smile of the visit. 
</P>
<P>
 It was my first sight of the judge at close range, and I was intimidated. 
Reporters routinely treat presidents with contempt and rudely shout questions 
at the Pope. But some of us in the room didn't dare complain to Ito about the 
working conditions or about any other matters that might be on our minds. After 
all, he has threatened to pull the plug on television coverage, temporarily 
barred the Los Angeles Daily News from the courtroom, and most recently 
canceled his subscription to the Daily Journal, a legal publication, because he 
didn't like a profile of a fellow judge. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 After the judge left, I talked to a more approachable person about the 
arrangements Ito had ordered. He's Scott Shulman, who is in charge of media 
technical facilities for the trial. 
</P>
<P>
 They were designed to make sure the sound feed from the courtroom was not 
broadcast by some scoop-happy television or radio station. During the federal 
trial of the police officers charged with beating Rodney King, a television 
station ignored a judge's no-broadcasting order, picking up the courtroom audio 
feed with a pressroom telephone. To make that impossible in the Simpson case, 
Ito moved the press into the rooms without phones. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only that, but Shulman has made him a "kill switch" so that the judge can 
cut off all sound from the courtroom if his orders are disobeyed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think if I were a judge, I would want a kill switch to give me control over 
what comes out of the audio," Shulman said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The word control is important in understanding Judge Ito's arrangements for 
the press. 
</P>
<P>
 It was lack of judicial control over the courtroom that led the U.S. Supreme 
Court to throw out the 1954 murder conviction of Dr. Sam Sheppard, whose 
Cleveland trial set the standard for ugly and undisciplined press coverage. The 
late Justice Tom Clark's opinion in the Sheppard case is the defining legal 
word on control of outrageous press coverage of trials. 
</P>
<P>
 I don't know whether Ito has studied the case recently, but it sounds like 
he's taking Clark's admonitions to heart. 
</P>
<P>
 Clark was disdainful of the Sheppard trial judge. "The trial court," he wrote, 
"failed to invoke procedures which would have guaranteed petitioner a fair 
trial, such as adopting stricter rules for use of the courtroom as petitioner's 
counsel requested, limiting their number and more closely supervising their 
courtroom conduct. . . . The carnival atmosphere at trial could easily have 
been avoided since the courtroom and courthouse premises are subject to control 
of the court." 
</P>
<P>
 Ito also knows that the young lawyer who successfully carried Sheppard's case 
to the Supreme Court is now a veteran attorney and member of the Simpson 
defense team, F. Lee Bailey. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Ito, I'm sure, doesn't want the Simpson trial to go the way of 
Sheppard's, to be ignominiously thrown out by the nation's highest court 
because the judge lost control. 
</P>
<P>
 That helps explain the cramped rooms the press must endure during jury 
selection. And what of the reporters' discomfort? "I think it's good for 
people," said consultant Shulman, whose regular job is with KABC Channel 7. 
"It's refreshing."

ALLEGED POLICE ABUSE CASE IS SETTLED; LITIGATION: LONG BEACH WILL PAY $170,000 
TO DON JACKSON AND FRIEND OVER A SECRETLY VIDEOTAPED CONFRONTATION WITH 
OFFICERS AFTER A TRAFFIC STOP IN 1989. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EDWARD J. BOYER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two years before an amateur cameraman videotaped Los Angeles police officers 
beating Rodney G. King, an NBC-TV camera crew secretly recorded a Long Beach 
officer who appeared to shove Don Jackson, a black former police officer, 
through a plate glass window after a traffic stop. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson quickly achieved national notoriety as the videotaped "sting" he had 
set up to show how police allegedly mistreat minorities was broadcast 
nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 In the five years since the incident, the two officers involved have retired, 
misdemeanor charges against them were dismissed and the last chapter arising 
from that infamous encounter came to a close Tuesday as Long Beach announced 
the settlement of a lawsuit brought by Jackson and a friend who was with him 
when he was arrested. 
</P>
<P>
 The episode thrust Long Beach and its Police Department into the spotlight of 
national attention, and the Jackson case prompted the police chief to crack 
down on his officers with additional discipline, supervision and stings of his 
own. 
</P>
<P>
 The settlement will pay Jackson and his friend, Jeffrey Hill, $170,000, "but 
the lion's share will go to attorney fees," said Long Beach Assistant City 
Atty. Robert Shannon. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the settlement is less than it would have cost to defend against the 
lawsuit. "The city was paying attorneys for the two officers and the police 
chief," Shannon said. "We would have spent far more than $170,000 to try the 
case." 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas E. Beck, Jackson's attorney, would not comment on how the settlement 
would be divided between Jackson and Hill, saying the distribution is 
confidential. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel vindicated," Jackson, now a graduate student at Pennsylvania State 
University, said Tuesday. "I feel that I was pointing out a problem that very 
few people wanted to deal with. I was lambasted by so many political officials 
who said I was crying wolf and only seeking personal attention. I know that I 
have shaken up that department, that I have forced change." 
</P>
<P>
 He said he will use part of the settlement to set up a hot line where people 
can report suspected police abuse. The lawsuit originally sought $385 million 
in damages from the city and officers -- $35 million on each of 11 causes of 
actions, including alleged civil rights violations, excessive force and 
malicious prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit grew out of a sting Jackson had set up with NBC to demonstrate his 
allegation that minorities, especially black men, are routinely harassed and 
abused by police.  
</P>
<P>
 On Jan. 14, 1989 -- Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday -- Long Beach Officers 
Mark Dickey and Mark Ramsey stopped Jackson's beat-up sedan on Pacific Coast 
Highway for an alleged traffic violation as Jackson and his friend, Hill, drove 
through the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The camera crew that had tailed Jackson, a former police sergeant in 
Hawthorne, recorded Dickey as the officer confronted Jackson and appeared to 
push his head through a plate-glass window. 
</P>
<P>
 Dickey was charged with misdemeanor assault on Jackson, and both officers were 
charged with filing a false police report. The two officers retired in 1990 on 
stress-related disabilities allegedly stemming from the Jackson case. They are 
being paid 50% of their salaries for life. 
</P>
<P>
 During the two years Dickey and Ramsey awaited trial, some Long Beach officers 
picketed NBC, and others wore T-shirts that read: "We Do Windows." 
</P>
<P>
 In the midst of the officers' 1991 trial, the incident was eclipsed by the 
videotaped King beating. After the longest misdemeanor trial in Long Beach 
history, jurors deadlocked 11-1 for acquittal in May and Municipal Judge James 
Wright dismissed the charges after declaring a mistrial. 
</P>
<P>
 After the mistrial, Long Beach National Assn. for the Advancement of Colored 
People member Ernest McBride said: "I was just thinking, if Los Angeles wants 
to move the Rodney King police brutality case to Long Beach, they can do it and 
they would declare that nothing happened." 
</P>
<P>
 The 1992 King trial was moved to Simi Valley where the four officers accused 
of beating the motorist were acquitted on all but one charge stemming from the 
beating. Those verdicts led to deadly and destructive rioting.

COMMAND SENDS VENUS PROBE INTO OBLIVION; SCIENCE: BEFORE IT DISINTEGRATES IN 
CRUSHING AIR PRESSURE, MAGELLAN SHOULD GIVE ITS CREATORS AT JPL NEW INSIGHTS 
INTO AN ALIEN ATMOSPHERE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT LEE HOTZ, TIMES SCIENCE WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With an electronic command whispered through a deep space antenna in Madrid, 
Douglas G. Griffith at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena sent the 
Magellan spacecraft circling to its doom Tuesday in the superheated, acid 
clouds above the highest mountain on Venus. 
</P>
<P>
 Transmitting data until the last, Magellan is expected to leave its distant 
creators in Pasadena with new insights into the aerodynamics of an alien 
atmosphere that may help them design more streamlined and fuel-efficient 
spacecraft. 
</P>
<P>
 Since arriving at Venus in 1990, Magellan has overcome technical problems and 
funding cuts to survey the topography and gravity of the planet in 
unprecedented detail. Beaming to Earth more than 1 trillion bytes of digital 
mapping data, it revolutionized the scientific view of the brightest planet in 
the sky. 
</P>
<P>
 By mapping Venus in such detail, the probe has done for the planet what the 
space agency now is attempting for Earth. Astronauts aboard the space shuttle 
Endeavour, which landed at Edwards Air Force Base on Tuesday, spent the past 11 
days scanning the home planet with a more advanced version of the synthetic 
aperture radar aboard Magellan. It penetrated the vegetation and crust of 
civilization obscuring Earth's surface just as Magellan's imaging radar peered 
through the clouds masking Venus. 
</P>
<P>
 After more than 15,000 orbits around the most hellishly hot planet in the 
solar system, the $900-million spacecraft Tuesday started to spiral deeper into 
Venus' hothouse atmosphere, where late today it is expected to disintegrate as 
the air pressure increases to crushing levels found on Earth only in ocean 
depths. The probe also is gradually losing power because its solar panels are 
deteriorating. 
</P>
<P>
 In five measured rocket bursts Tuesday, the craft slowed and gradually 
descended to within 90 miles of the planet's surface near Mt. Maxwell, a 
Venusian peak that dwarfs Mt. Everest. Program manager Griffith and his JPL 
team expect to lose contact with Magellan well before it reaches the planet's 
surface. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometime late today, "it will slow down to almost nothing and flutter down to 
its death," Griffith said. 
</P>
<P>
 By studying that process, scientists hope to learn more about aerodynamics 
that might help them save fuel and extend the life of orbiting spacecraft. If 
NASA engineers, for example, can make the design of the agency's space station 
even 10% more efficient, they might be able to keep it in orbit longer with 
fewer refuelings from the space shuttle.  
</P>
<P>
 The men and women at JPL have explored the mysterious canyons and lava fields 
of Venus from small beige cubicles in the laboratory's space operations 
facility, using Magellan's sophisticated sensors to obtain by remote control 
detailed views of Venus' volcanic domes, rills and vast craters. On Tuesday, 
however, they were forced to rely on much more primitive instrument readings to 
monitor the condition of the craft as it descended into the planet's thick 
atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
 After each firing of the craft's rocket motors Tuesday, the scientists and 
technicians left their cubicles and anxiously checked the instrument readings 
on three small black and white television monitors in the Magellan operations 
area. They monitored fuel pressure, signal strength and power for any symptoms 
of distress, like parents trying to diagnose an infant's state of mind from its 
cryptic cries and gestures.  
</P>
<P>
 "Every time we fire a thruster, we are putting more drag on the spacecraft," 
said mission planner Rob Lock. "Pretty soon, the atmosphere will grab us. 
Temperatures will rise. . . . This is the exciting part, right when we are on 
the edge of the cliff."  
</P>
<P>
 At the last mission planning meeting on Tuesday, almost the entire project 
team assembled in a small conference room to debate the spacecraft's final 
maneuver. As they reviewed the technical merits of sending the spacecraft even 
deeper into the atmosphere of Venus, mission director James M. Stewart passed a 
roll of black crepe and a pair of scissors down the table. 
</P>
<P>
 One by one, the navigation specialists, operations engineers and mission 
planners cut themselves strips and fashioned makeshift black armbands of 
mourning. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sentimental? Yes," said Lock. "This has been a fabulous mission."

PANEL OKS DREDGING OF MARINA; WATERWAYS: COASTAL COMMISSION REVERSES REJECTION 
OF MARINA DEL REY PLAN AFTER ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS PROMISES TO SEEK LONG-TERM 
SOLUTIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG KRIKORIAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The California Coastal Commission agreed Tuesday to allow tons of contaminated 
silt and sand to be dredged from the entrance of Marina del Rey -- but only 
after securing assurances that the Army Corps of Engineers will develop 
long-term solutions to keep the channel clear. 
</P>
<P>
 The 11-0 vote reverses the commission's rejection last month of the corps' 
plan to remove as much as 135,000 cubic yards of material, encase it in plastic 
and dump it in Los Angeles Harbor as part of a port expansion project. The 
dredging will be completed by Dec. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Although still expressing concern about the environmental consequences of the 
dredging, commissioners concluded that the silt and sand -- which contains lead 
and other contaminants -- will be far less hazardous than other fill being 
poured into Los Angeles Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
 Commissioners shifted gears after being warned that the marina's waterways are 
becoming perilously shallow and must be deepened to keep them open to 
recreational boaters and the Coast Guard, which maintains an air-sea rescue 
headquarters in the marina. 
</P>
<P>
 "It . . . is urgent to open up the marina," Dorothy Soule a professor of 
marine biology at USC, told commissioners. "You must take as much out of there 
as you can, as fast as you can." 
</P>
<P>
 For years, the Corps of Engineers has periodically dredged the marina to keep 
its main channel clear of untold tons of material deposited by nearby Ballona 
Creek. The creek drains a 126-square-mile area from Downtown Los Angeles to the 
Pacific Ocean. 
</P>
<P>
 But with the increasing discovery of contaminated materials, the dredging has 
run afoul of many public agencies and environmental organizations, including 
Heal the Bay. In public hearings and private communications, they have raised 
objections not only to where the contaminated material will be dumped, but what 
long-term solutions are being developed to reduce the runoff from Ballona 
Creek. As much as 10 billion gallons of creek water a day can flow into the sea 
during heavy rains. 
</P>
<P>
 The criticism of the corps' efforts led to last month's commission decision to 
reject the dredging project, estimated to cost no more than $500,000. 
</P>
<P>
 But after its plan was rejected, the corps resubmitted the proposal with some 
significant changes, said Mark Delaplaine who presented the commission's staff 
report at Tuesday's meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Most notably, Delaplaine said, the corps agreed to immediately investigate 
other long-term solutions to the dredging and disposal problems at Marina del 
Rey. The federal agency signed an agreement that commits it to developing a 
workable plan to preserve the channel in conjunction with other agencies, 
including the Coastal Commission and county Department of Beaches and Harbors. 
</P>
<P>
 "The key was reaching an agreement to sit down and talk," Delaplaine said 
after the vote. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement led several former critics of the project, among them Los 
Angeles City Councilman Rudy Svorinich Jr., to temper their opposition while a 
final plan is developed. 
</P>
<P>
 Some remained skeptical that the dredging will do anything more than transfer 
contaminated soil from one coastal site to another. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're concerned about the adequacy of the monitoring" of San Pedro Bay, said 
Greg Smith, president of the Point Fermin Homeowners Assn. "At worst, this 
project could become a monstrous new Superfund site." 
</P>
<P>
 Dredging advocates acknowledged that the project is only a stopgap measure -- 
and one that could prove nearly futile if winter rains swell Ballona Creek. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are hoping we will not have catastrophic flooding . . . that we will be OK 
for a couple of years" with the dredging, said the corps' Col. Michal R. 
Robinson. "But . . . we are subject to the whims of nature."

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; SETTLEMENT 
REACHED IN D.A. OFFICE SEX HARASSMENT SUIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A settlement was reached Tuesday in the punitive phase of a sexual harassment 
lawsuit by an investigator against her supervisor in the Los Angeles County 
district attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, a jury awarded $120,000 in general damages to Virginia Harper, who 
alleged in a 1992 lawsuit that supervising investigator Henry Grayson fondled 
her and verbally harassed her while they worked together in the district 
attorney's Santa Monica office. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyers in the case said the punitive-damages settlement was reached just as 
the jury returned to court to decide on the monetary punishment for Grayson. 
With the case settled, the panel was sent home. 
</P>
<P>
 Terms were not disclosed, but Harper's attorney, Peggy Garrity, hinted last 
week that she thought Grayson should have to pay her client about $200,000. 
Harper had sought more than $1 million in damages.  
</P>
<P>
 "But cases like these are never about money," Garrity said. "They're more 
about empowerment, and having (women's) voices heard."

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; 
FIREFIGHTERS HONOR 47 WHO DIED IN LINE OF DUTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Firefighters on Tuesday honored the 47 Los Angeles city Fire Department 
personnel who have died in the line of duty. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're here today on a very solemn note," Assistant Chief Dean Cathey 
said."It's also a very proud moment for us, because it's an occasion in which 
we recognize those who have done the most noble deeds for their community."  
</P>
<P>
 About 100 firefighters, city employees and elected officials gathered at noon 
for the annual memorial service, in front of a monument erected on the 1st 
Street lawn of City Hall.  
</P>
<P>
 A kilt-clad firefighter played the bagpipes and squads of firefighters in full 
dress uniform stood at attention as a representative of the Los Angeles 
Firemen's Relief Assn. read the "honor roll" of fallen comrades.  
</P>
<P>
 Officials laid a wreath of red and white carnations at the monument and four 
helicopters flew over the Civic Center. Capt. Daniel McCarty played taps to 
close the ceremony.  
</P>
<P>
 The last city firefighter to die in the line of duty was Benjamin Pinel. He 
died Dec. 4, 1984, while battling a restaurant fire in West Los Angeles, said 
city fire spokesman Milton Urquilla.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: GLASSELL PARK; MAN 
CHARGED IN ALLEGED MISTREATMENT OF HIS DOG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Glassell Park man accused of neglecting his great Dane was named in 
misdemeanor charges filed by the city attorney's office Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Graham Thomas Finlay, 56, faces single counts of animal neglect and keeping an 
unlicensed dog.Each is punishable by up to six months in jail and a $1,000 
fine, said Los Angeles City Atty. James Hahn.  
</P>
<P>
 City Department of Animal Regulation officials began to investigate Finlay in 
February after someone filed a complaint. 
</P>
<P>
 An animal control officer went to Finlay's house and found an emaciated dog 
named Sasha, with a four-inch growth on her chest, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The animal control officer ordered Finlay to take the dog to a veterinarian. 
Finlay took Sasha to the Gateway Animal Hospital, where it was determined that 
the growth was benign. But Finlay refused to return for a follow-up 
examination, Mason said.  
</P>
<P>
 A July 14 hearing was scheduled at the city attorney's office, but Finlay 
failed to show up. He came in the next day with a rabies inoculation 
certificate and promised to get the dog licensed but never did so, Mason said.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: STUDIO CITY; LOUD PARTY 
HELD AT HOUSE BEFORE SETTLEMENT IS SIGNED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A raucous party was held Sunday at a Studio City mansion in violation of a 
settlement to restore restore quiet in the neighborhood, but it will have no 
effect on the agreement because it has not yet been signed, a Los Angeles city 
councilman's aide said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 A Superior Court judge is expected to sign the agreement Oct. 17 between the 
city and Paul Campbell, owner of a $2.1-million, 7,100-square-foot house on 
Wrightwood Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 Last weekend, the mansion's residents held a party for more than 200 people. 
The settlement would limit events to 25 guests. 
</P>
<P>
 City traffic control officers and fire inspectors monitored the party because 
traffic clogged the street, said Lisa Zeni of Councilman Joel Wachs' staff. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors have been complaining for years about large, noisy celebrations at 
the mansion, some of which have been featured on MTV. Party-goers blocked 
driveways with their cars and littered the streets with bottles and cans, 
neighbors said.  
</P>
<P>
 The proposed settlement would bar parties without the proper permit and 
prohibit commercial activities, such as cover charges and the sale of alcohol.

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: SANTA ANA; HEALTH CLINIC HAS ADVICE THAT PEOPLE CAN SINK 
TEETH INTO 
</P>

<P>
 Six weeks ago, Lino Darde's uncontrolled diabetes threatened to rob him of his 
sight, damage his limbs and shorten his life. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, thanks to a program run by Latino Health Access, a local nonprofit 
health clinic, he changed his diet, began exercising regularly and controlled 
his illness.Furthermore, Darde, 42, recently joined the program as a community 
educator and now visits diabetics to explain to them the importance of eating 
right and staying fit. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need people who can learn and pass on this knowledge to others because 
diabetes is a disease that can be controlled," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, he and several others who benefited from the organization's 
program joined a news conference announcing a drive designed to raise money for 
additional health brochures and educational materials to combat diabetes. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the "Tamales for Health" program, the clinic will sell low-fat, low-salt 
tamales for $1 to restaurants, bakeries and the public. The goal is to begin a 
comprehensive health education campaign designed to help residents reduce their 
risk of illness, including diabetes, heart disease, asthma and tuberculosis. 
</P>
<P>
 The need is especially great in the Latino community, where many low-income 
people cannot afford adequate health care, Program Coordinator Roberto Diaz 
said. As a result, many do not receive treatment for preventable or 
controllable illnesses until they are life-threatening. 
</P>
<P>
 Darde said clinic professionals and volunteers plan to help those already 
suffering symptoms of diabetes, but are most concerned with educating people so 
they never experience symptoms. 
</P>
<P>
 To purchase tamales or receive more information, call the clinic at (714) 
542-7792. JON NALICK

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; OFFICERS 
FIRED GUNS AS SCARE TACTIC, PROSECUTOR TELLS JURY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two off-duty police officers who claim they were firing at the ground were 
actually trying to scare a California Highway Patrol officer last February when 
they shot their guns, a prosecutor told a jury Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty.Susan Steinfeld said Ted Teyechea and Michael Herrera may 
not have wanted to kill CHP Officer Scott Wall on Feb. 9, but they did want to 
save their careers by getting away from him.  
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Police Department officers are on trial for assault with a 
deadly weapon against a police officer, gross negligence in the discharge of a 
firearm and shooting into an occupied vehicle.  
</P>
<P>
 The two officers allegedly fired a total of 21 shots during a drunken spree on 
the Harbor and Artesia freeways.  
</P>
<P>
 The officers, both nine-year LAPD veterans, have been suspended without pay 
pending the outcome of the trial.  
</P>
<P>
 According to previous testimony, Teyechea and Herrera went to a Sunset 
Boulevard bar after they got off duty that morning. Teyechea said he drank 
"three or four beers" during the more than five hours he and his partner spent 
in the bar.  
</P>
<P>
 Teyechea said he was feeling frustrated, angry and depressed because he had 
just learned he would not be getting a pay raise for the second year in a row.

 Bushala Brothers Inc. has decided to allow county Republicans to stay in the 
office space the company donated to further the party's goals. 
</P>
<P>
 The company had sent the Orange County Republican Central Committee a 24-hour 
eviction notice Monday, but an agreement was struck Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Anthony N. Bushala said his father, George, first thought the committee would 
be working for the reelection of Rep. Ed Royce (R-Fullerton). But the GOP 
headquarters was run by Lois Godfrey, wife of City Council candidate Peter 
Godfrey. 
</P>
<P>
 Bushala alleged that callers were being urged by the committee to support 
Peter Godfrey. Bushala said the family was outraged because his family supports 
Dave Zenger, a Republican who is challenging Peter Godfrey. 
</P>
<P>
 Lois Godfrey, who was serving as co-chairwoman of the committee, denied that 
she or any other committee member ever told callers to vote for her husband. 
But she resigned as part of the agreement.MIMI KO

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; TEARFUL 
JOYNER TELLS COURT OF HUSBAND'S STOP BY LAPD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Olympic sprinter Florence Griffith Joyner cried in federal court Tuesday as 
she recalled the day her husband was ordered out of the car at gunpoint by 
police in Hollywood.  
</P>
<P>
 The only U.S. woman to win four track and field medals in one Olympics 
testified that when Al Joyner showed up at their Mission Viejo home on May 8, 
1992, he was no longer a "happy-go-lucky" person. 
</P>
<P>
 Joyner, who won a gold medal in the triple jump at the 1984 Games in Los 
Angeles, was on the way to a Hollywood news conference that day to announce his 
plans to compete in meets at UCLA and Occidental College the next day.  
</P>
<P>
 Instead, he said he ended up pulled over twice within minutes that day, and 
then he returned to the scene with camera crews to demonstrate what had 
happened.  
</P>
<P>
 Joyner, 34, had been training for the 110-meter high hurdles and triple jump, 
and had hoped to qualify for the Olympic trials and ultimately be named to the 
U.S. team competing in Barcelona that year.  
</P>
<P>
 Police said they ran a check on Joyner's license plate because he was driving 
erratically and was a threat to other drivers. He was not ticketed, however. 
</P>
<P>
 Joyner sued the Los Angeles Police Department and nine officers, claiming he 
was pulled over because he was black. Five of the officers, most of whom 
participated in the second stop, have been dismissed as defendants.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LONG BEACH; REAL ESTATE 
AGENT UNHURT IN BOMBING OF HIS CAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An eight-inch bomb damaged a Long Beach real estate agent's car Tuesday, but 
he escaped without a scratch. 
</P>
<P>
 The blast occurred about 9 a.m. in the 700 block of East Ocean Boulevard, said 
Long Beach police spokeswoman Margarita DeWitt. 
</P>
<P>
 The apparent intended victim, commercial agent Lloyd Ikerd, was shaken up but 
otherwise unhurt.  
</P>
<P>
 "The car was just totally blown up," Ikerd said. Asked if he knew who would 
target him, Ikerd said: "I have no idea."  
</P>
<P>
 Police said the device was about eight inches long and had been placed under 
the passenger side of the car. The explosion blew off the car's hubcaps and 
front grill and caused the air bag to deploy, according to KCBS-Channel 2.

 Peggy Shay was born to be wild. 
</P>
<P>
 The 77-year-old Leisure World resident, just back from a hiking excursion deep 
into the Grand Canyon, is a veteran four-wheeler.In her 1986 Toyota 4-Runner, 
she has climbed the treacherous mountain paths of Death Valley and plowed 
through the shoreline waters of the Gulf of California. 
</P>
<P>
 "You just get off the road, throw it into four-wheel and go up the side of a 
mountain," says Shay, whose CB handle is G.G.: "It stands for geriatric gypsy." 
</P>
<P>
 Shay, who once owned an Oregon cattle ranch with her late husband, Jack, 
blasts through the preconceptions of old age much as she powers across the 
uninhabited territory of her favorite off-road site, Copper Canyon, Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've always had trucks," Shay says. "People who lived on ranches and farms 
always did this -- they just didn't call it four-wheeling. They called it 
work." 
</P>

<P>
 While Los Angeles is considered the bank robbery capital of the United States, 
neighboring Orange County has far fewer of these crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 Bank robbers in Orange County net less than $1 million each year, according to 
the California Department of Justice. 
</P>
<P>
 The number of bank robberies increased substantially from 1990 to 1991 but has 
declined gradually in the past two years. Today

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: NEWPORT BEACH; STUDY FINDS TOLLWAY WON'T WORSEN TRAFFIC 
</P>

<P>
 A traffic study commissioned by the San Joaquin Transportation Corridor Agency 
indicates that rush-hour traffic on Coast Highway in Corona del Mar will not 
worsen by the year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
 But opponents of a proposal to impose a toll on cars using Newport Coast Drive 
said the figures underestimate the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 The study, released last week, indicates that rush-hour traffic on Coast 
Highway would be 1,800 cars per hour -- an increase of 100 cars per hour since 
Newport Coast Drive opened in 1991 -- if the San Joaquin tollway were not 
built. But researchers said traffic will remain stable at 1,700 cars per hour 
if the tollway is built. 
</P>
<P>
 The study by Austin-Foust Associates began in June after residents and local 
politicians complained about a plan to absorb a 1.4-mile section of Newport 
Coast Drive into the tollway. 
</P>
<P>
 Questionnaires answered by 2,833 Newport Coast Drive users indicate that 65% 
of them would use Coast Highway instead of Newport Coast Drive if a proposed 
50-cent toll in each direction is imposed. Officials said 34% of the surveys 
were returned. 
</P>
<P>
 The challenged section of the proposed 15-mile tollway is a 1.4-mile strip of 
Newport Coast Drive from MacArthur Boulevard in Irvine to Bonita Canyon Drive. 
The tollway would extend to Interstate 5 near San Juan Capistrano. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents in Corona del Mar and Laguna Beach object to both the 50-cent toll 
and its potential to divert traffic off the planned toll road and onto Coast 
Highway. Earlier this month, a coalition of resident groups sued the agency to 
block the toll. HOLLY J. WAGNER

 Eight-year-old Trent McGee returned home from the hospital last week, three 
months after he was paralyzed in a traffic accident caused by the driver of a 
stolen car who ran a red light. 
</P>
<P>
 He remains paralyzed from the neck down and must use a respirator to breathe. 
Just across the street from the McGee home, the sounds of children at recess 
can be heard from the school where Trent attended second grade last year. 
</P>
<P>
 His parents are now praying for a miracle, that Trent's paralysis is temporary 
and that he will return to school and the life he once had. 
</P>
<P>
 "You just can't tell with a spinal cord injury," said Cheryl McGee, Trent's 
mother. "He could make a full recovery -- that's what we're hoping for." 
</P>
<P>
 When he travels outside his home, Trent uses a portable respirator attached to 
his small wheelchair. At home, he plays video games, thanks to a device created 
by Loma Linda University rehabilitation specialist Dave Warner. With electrodes 
taped to his face, Trent operates the games by moving facial muscles. 
</P>
<P>
 Trent was riding in the family station wagon with his mother and older sister 
on July 11 when Dana Point resident John Eric Phelps, 31, crashed into their 
car after running a red light at an Irvine intersection. His mother and sister 
were not seriously injured.  
</P>
<P>
 Phelps was fleeing from police in a stolen Mercedes. He pleaded guilty in July 
and was sentenced to seven years in state prison. 
</P>
<P>
 At Stone Creek Elementary School, Trent's classmates recently raised $3,000 to 
help pay for the cost of his medical care. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've stayed by him all the way through," Stone Creek Principal Marilyn 
Young said. "He doesn't want to accept this at all. His desire is to be out and 
playing and jumping around. I'll be glad when he gets back, even if it's in a 
wheelchair."RUSS LOAR

DESPITE OPPOSITION, FIGURE IN KING CASE HIRED FOR POLICE JOB; LAW ENFORCEMENT: 
COUNCIL APPROVES APPOINTMENT OF TIMOTHY E. WIND TO THE CIVILIAN POSITION OF 
COMMUNITY SERVICE OFFICER IN CULVER CITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 One resident condemned it as "a slap in the city's face." Another called it 
"shoddy." But despite visceral opposition, Culver City this week hired Timothy 
E. Wind, a former defendant in the Rodney G. King case, as a community service 
officer on its police force. 
</P>
<P>
 City Council members late Monday unanimously endorsed the Aug. 23 decision by 
Police Chief Ted Cooke to appoint Wind to the civilian post, pointing out that 
Wind was acquitted in the King beating and arguing that the judicial system 
should not be second-guessed. 
</P>
<P>
 About a dozen people in the audience expressed support for Wind, while two 
dozen others cheered loudly at the suggestion by one of their speakers that 
Wind be fired immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 "Judge Tim Wind for the job he does for Culver City," said one Wind supporter, 
Theodore Smith III, a Culver City resident and deputy Los Angeles city 
attorney. "If he fails, then fire him." 
</P>
<P>
 From his wheelchair, Morris Dodd said he has gathered more than 100 signatures 
on a petition favoring Wind. 
</P>
<P>
 "If he was protecting my life, I'd feel very comfortable," Dodd said. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other side, resident David Hauptman complained that Wind's hiring was a 
blow to the notion of "respect of all groups in this city."  
</P>
<P>
 Wind, 34, was a rookie officer at the time of the King beating in 1991. The 
Los Angeles Police Department fired him, finding that he unnecessarily struck 
King with a baton. He was acquitted of criminal charges in two trials and 
cleared of wrongdoing in King's civil lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 The Culver City Council voted unanimously to support Cooke's decision to 
appoint Wind, with some members complaining that a routine hiring decision had 
been turned into a political issue.  
</P>
<P>
 "What I hear is that you want to be the judge and the jury -- well it's too 
late," Councilman Mike Balkman said to opponents at Monday's meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials released a statement last week that described Wind's 
$9.52-per-hour position as a clerical job performed at a desk. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the full description of a community service officer's duties shows 
that Wind could have substantial contact with the public. The job includes 
crowd control and security checks for parks, schools and neighborhoods, issuing 
subpoenas and investigating minor incidents. The job description also states 
that community service officers must be able to deal tactfully and effectively 
with people, and to analyze problems and find solutions. 
</P>
<P>
 Many community service officers have gone on to positions on Culver City's 
armed and sworn police force, a point that opponents of Wind's hiring raised 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I suggest that Mr. Wind pursue a job that suits his personality more," said 
Culver City resident Margaret Lindgren, a member of the Committee to Remove 
Timothy Wind. 
</P>
<P>
 The opposition probably will now pursue the creation of a civilian review 
board to oversee decisions made by the Police Department, one leader said.

COUNTY SUPERVISORS MOVE TO ENACT TOUGH SMOKING CURBS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors -- going on record against a 
tobacco industry-sponsored proposition on the November ballot that would repeal 
local anti-smoking ordinances -- Tuesday underscored its opposition by laying 
the groundwork for passage of the toughest county restrictions ever on tobacco 
use. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisors unanimously approved a proposal that would restrict smoking in all 
public places, workplaces and enclosed restaurants and that would greatly 
restrict youth access to tobacco products. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed restaurant smoking ban is similar to a controversial law 
implemented last year by the city of Los Angeles. The city ordinance applies to 
all enclosed restaurants, but does not govern restaurant bars or outdoor 
patios. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed county ban would also exempt bar and patio areas but would give 
restaurant operators and other business owners the option of declaring their 
establishments smoke-free or of providing a separately enclosed area for 
smokers. 
</P>
<P>
 The county's Public Health Commission, which proposed the restrictions, had 
recommended an outright smoking ban, but Supervisor Gloria Molina said the 
county and city laws should be consistent. 
</P>
<P>
 "I also believe that business owners should be given an option," Molina said. 
"If they can't provide a space that does not affect nonsmokers, then they 
should not allow smoking." 
</P>
<P>
 The county will also consider regulations aimed at restricting sales of 
tobacco to minors. The proposed laws would regulate vending machine sales, ban 
the free distribution of tobacco products and promotional items to minors, and 
restrict advertising around schools, churches, and boys and girls clubs. 
</P>
<P>
 A county Department of Health Services report noted that a state law banning 
sales of cigarettes to minors is rarely enforced but that most county 
residents, including smokers, support such restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisors voiced concern that a state ballot measure may thwart local 
attempts to address such concerns. Proposition 188 would repeal local smoking 
bans and prevent cities and counties from regulating tobacco use.

<P>
 Organizers of this weekend's Silverado Days will not be able to ban political 
campaigning from the city's annual fair. 
</P>
<P>
 Jerry Sigler, a representative of the Noon Lions Club, asked the City Council 
to help keep the tradition of nonpartisanship by banning political literature 
and authorizing police to escort campaigners from the park. 
</P>
<P>
 The city attorney nixed the idea this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Sigler argued that the Lions lease the park from Oct. 13 to 16 and become 
liable for any accidents. The park belongs to them for those four days and they 
should be able to enact rules of a private club, he argued. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant City Atty. Andrew Arcynski reviewed the lease between the city and 
the club and gave his verdict: The city is, in effect, a co-sponsor of the 
event and cannot ban political activity, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fred Smith, chairman of the event, said he hoped candidates instead would 
abide by a "gentlemen's agreement" to do their politicking away from the park 
this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith said the club will send announcements to the candidates and request that 
they not "do any stumping" at the fair. The four-day Silverado Days carnival 
begins Thursday in William Peak Park at El Dorado Drive and Knott Avenue.

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: SEAL BEACH; CITY WON'T CHANGE SOLICITATION HOURS

<P>
 A 1916 California Supreme Court decision establishing "reasonable hours of 
repose" is reason enough to allow door-to-door solicitors an extra two hours at 
night, according to the Seal Beach city attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members reluctantly extended solicitation hours to 10 p.m. last month 
but also directed the city attorney to look for a legal loophole that would 
allow them to turn back the clock.City Atty. Quinn Barrow told council members 
Monday night there are no loopholes that would remove the risk of lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 A fund-raising group had complained that the city's 8 p.m. deadline for 
door-to-door solicitation was out of step with state law. In 1916, the state 
Supreme Court ruled that 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. could be considered "reasonable 
hours of repose," establishing the hours that door-to-door solicitation could 
be prohibited. 
</P>
<P>
 Barrow said the court ruling still is valid, though earlier deadlines remain 
in some cities because they have not been contested. In Seal Beach, the 
complaint was not made by the Sierra Club as the city initially reported, but 
by representatives of Public Interest Research, according to Barrow. 
</P>
<P>
 The council plans no action to shorten the extended hours. RUSS LOAR

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: NEWPORT BEACH; CITY HAMMERING OUT LAW REGULATING NOISE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Regulation of leaf blowers remains the only noise issue to be resolved by the 
City Council, which this week agreed on outlines of the city's first 
comprehensive noise ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
 Most speakers at the meeting favored tighter controls on various sources of 
noise, but opinions varied on the most egregious offenders.Golf course 
maintenance, sounds from beach-goers near homes, and noise from sports games at 
parks and schools topped the list of complaints. 
</P>
<P>
 After a three-hour discussion and public hearing Monday night, the council 
decided that greens maintenance may not begin before 6 a.m., and maintenance of 
sand traps, fairways and other areas may not start before 7 a.m. Residents have 
complained that maintenance now starts as early as 5 a.m.  
</P>
<P>
 The new law also would classify all properties in the city as residential, 
commercial or industrial and assign acceptable noise limits for each. Noisy 
activities in commercial or industrial areas would be expected to maintain the 
lower-level standards of residential areas if the sounds carry that far. Under 
the regulations, daytime is 7 a.m. to 10 p.m.; nighttime is 10 p.m. to 7 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Property maintenance is a separately regulated activity, with noisy functions 
limited from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. weekdays and Saturdays, and 9 a.m. to 8 p.m. 
Sundays. 
</P>
<P>
 The city cannot regulate noise from school properties, such as the Marian 
Bergeson Pool at Corona del Mar High School, if the noise is generated by 
district-sanctioned sports activities, City Attorney Robert Burnham said. 
</P>
<P>
 But a spokesman for the city's Parks, Beaches and Recreation Commission said 
the panel would work with school district officials to minimize noise from the 
pool and other sports. 
</P>
<P>
 The council voted to publicize the proposed gas blower ban and take more 
public testimony. Another hearing is scheduled Oct. 24. HOLLY J. WAGNER

 Neighbors of a local surf shop say a weekend promotional event veered out of 
control when someone repeatedly yelled obscenities over a public address 
system. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents complained to council members Monday night that a young man shouted 
something into a microphone about performing a sex act with a skateboard during 
a skating exhibition held at Inflight Surf and Sail on Saturday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't need that kind of language broadcast all over the neighborhood," 
said nearby homeowner Maggie Schmitt, adding that she was especially 
embarrassed because her new neighbor, a minister, was moving in that day. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents say amplified noise from the Pacific Coast Highway store blanketed 
the Old Town neighborhood all day. No one could be reached at the store for 
comment Tuesday and no one from the shop attended Monday's meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 "They weren't shouting obscenities all day. It was pretty obvious that 
somebody had gotten hold of the microphone," said resident Jeff Paquin, who 
lives about a block away from the shop. Paquin was in his upstairs bathroom 
getting ready to go out for dinner with his wife about 5 p.m. when he heard the 
skateboard references booming from the store's public address system. "It 
probably just got out of control." 
</P>
<P>
 City Manager Jerry L. Bankston said store owners had not applied for a permit 
as required to hold the outdoor event. City officials will investigate the 
incident. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Marilyn Bruce Hastings, who represents the Old Town area, said 
the store has generally been a good neighbor to surrounding residents. 
</P>
<P>
 "The neighbors don't mind having the events there, they just felt that this 
time, whoever was talking on the microphone overstepped their bounds," Hastings 
said.RUSS LOAR

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: MISSION VIEJO; VOTE ON CROWN VALLEY OFFICE PLANS DELAYED

<TEXT>
<P>
 A proposed seven-story office complex on Crown Valley Parkway -- which five 
years ago was part of a grand scheme to create a civic center for South County 
-- will be delayed at least another six months. 
</P>
<P>
 The Planning Commission agreed last week to delay a hearing on the project 
until April because the Mission Hospital Regional Medical Center -- a partner 
in the development -- was recently sold to another hospital, St. Joseph 
Hospital of Orange. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman from another partner in the development, Bentall Property 
Management, told commissioners that St. Joseph Hospital needed time to evaluate 
the project, especially with a continuing soft market for office space. 
</P>
<P>
 Situated on five acres at Crown Valley Parkway and Medical Center Drive, the 
proposed office complex would boast 175,000 square feet with another 183,000 
square feet of parking. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mission Hospital Regional Medical Center won approval from the city for 
the development in 1990, just as demand for office space began spiraling 
downward. 
</P>
<P>
 Called Crown Pointe, the office structure was once seen as a crown jewel in 
plans to create a massive shopping, civic center and business corridor on Crown 
Valley Parkway. City leaders had envisioned the area becoming the mythical 
center of South County. 
</P>
<P>
 But city voters overwhelmingly turned down civic center plans, the bottom 
dropped out of the office market and a sluggish economy delayed a second 
shopping mall off Crown Valley Parkway. 
</P>
<P>
 After their original permit expired last year, the project partners came back 
to the city last year with the original plans for a seven-story office 
building. FRANK MESSINA

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: MISSION VIEJO; ROLLER HOCKEY PLAYERS IN LINE TO GET 4 
CITY-APPROVED RINKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 After being banned from almost every school in the city, roller hockey players 
now will have four rinks of their own. 
</P>
<P>
 To the cheers of players and parents, the City Council on Monday approved 
building a tournament-style rink as part of a future park and renovating the 
city-owned Upper Marguerite tennis courts into a roller hockey facility. 
</P>
<P>
 "This could be very nice," Councilwoman Sharon Cody said. "This is something 
special where everyone finds something they like."  
</P>
<P>
 For older club competitors, the city will build a full-size competition 
facility and practice rink on about four acres of a planned 10-acre park at 
Alicia Parkway and Olympiad Road. 
</P>
<P>
 Tentatively called Applegate Park, the site will be developed with funds from 
the Mission Viejo Co. as part of a 1990 deal with the city that granted $12 
million in parks for approval of a 700-home tract. 
</P>
<P>
 The city is considering proposals from 15 companies and individuals who want 
to build the rink, concession stands and a pro shop on the park in exchange for 
a long-term lease. 
</P>
<P>
 The Upper Marguerite tennis courts will be converted to rinks for a league run 
by the YMCA for those 14 years old and younger. The YMCA recently agreed to 
lease the adjoining recreation center from the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The effort to find a roller hockey facility started in April when the 
Capistrano Unified School District asked the City Council to ban roller hockey 
players, along with skateboarders, from their campuses. 
</P>
<P>
 Several players, coaches and parents from the city's club teams showed up to 
protest the ban. The council voted to establish a task force on the issue.

$2.08-MILLION SHIP FINALLY COMES IN FOR LAKE FOREST SUPER LOTTO PLAYER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Persistence finally paid off for a Lake Forest woman, who won a Super Lotto 
jackpot Tuesday of $2.08 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Blanca Kobel, who declined interviews, has missed playing Super Lotto only 
four times in the past three years, according to Norma Minas, a state Lotto 
spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
 Kobel purchased her winning ticket at a Sav-On Drugs in Lake Forest. She split 
the $4.16-million jackpot with David and Julie Liedahl of Carson. He is a truck 
driver and she is a truck dispatcher, lottery officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Within three weeks, Kobel and the Liedahls should receive the first of 20 
annual checks for $104,000. After taxes, Kobel will keep $74,880, Minas said.

SUSPECT IN 3 ATTACKS CAPTURED AFTER SWAT TEAM FIRES GAS INTO APARTMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A police SWAT team, firing tear gas and "flash-bang" canisters, captured a 
suspect Tuesday wanted in connection with a weekend series of attacks in 
Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 Marlon Ray Anderson, 19, was taken in handcuffs by police at 4:15 p.m. after 
they fired into a barricaded apartment in the 7900 block of Court Street, 
according to Buena Park police Sgt. Robert Chaney. 
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim police said they were informed of Anderson's location and asked Buena 
Park police for help. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson was sought by Anaheim police in connection with the rape of a 
13-year-old girl, an assault with a deadly weapon on a 16-year-old girl and an 
attempted murder of a man, according to Anaheim Police Sgt. Steve Rodig. The 
three unrelated incidents all took place in West Anaheim over the weekend, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson, who was on probation for an earlier robbery conviction, was held 
without bail in the Anaheim detention facility, Rodig said. The investigation 
is continuing.

ALIBI SAVED ARRESTEE FROM POSSIBLE '3 STRIKES' CONVICTION; LAW ENFORCEMENT: 
OPERATION ROUNDUP INDICTMENTS BEING REVIEWED AFTER DISMISSAL OF CASE AGAINST 
MAN WHO WAS IN PRISON WHEN SUPPOSEDLY VIDEOTAPED SELLING DRUGS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEE ROMNEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A man arrested in last month's Operation Roundup who had charges against him 
dropped last week could have faced a "three strikes" conviction and a possible 
life sentence if prosecutors hadn't confirmed his iron-clad alibi, court 
records show. 
</P>
<P>
 Gustavo Arroyo Martinez, 26, of Santa Ana had been convicted on felony drug 
charges four times since 1992, before he was indicted on charges of selling 
drugs to an undercover informant on April 15 as part of Operation Roundup, a 
well publicized, five-month attempt to crack down on gangs and drug dealing, 
court records show. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County district attorney's office dismissed that charge Friday when 
prosecutors learned that Martinez was actually in state prison the day a man 
identified as him was videotaped selling drugs to undercover agents, marking 
the latest in a series of misidentifications that have spurred a systematic 
review of all Operation Roundup indictments. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Public Defender Ronald Y. Butler said mistaken identity in 
Martinez's case could have been grave if he hadn't provided such a foolproof 
alibi. Three strikes defendants face 25 years to life in prison, the same 
sentence facing first-degree murderers. 
</P>
<P>
 "If he was innocent of that particular crime and he was sentenced to 25 years 
to life, it would have been a real miscarriage of justice," Butler said. "I 
mean, you can imagine if his alibi were family or friends, instead of being 
incarcerated, it's likely the D.A. would not have dismissed. That was a real 
edgy one." 
</P>
<P>
 Another Operation Roundup suspect, Luis F. Lopez, 20, of Santa Ana, was 
released from custody last week after a preliminary investigation determined 
that he was in a Texas jail when an informant told police he was selling drugs 
on a Santa Ana street. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervising Deputy Dist. Atty. Mel Jensen said he is awaiting further 
documentation before deciding whether to drop charges against Lopez. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, Jensen revealed that prosecutors had dropped charges against 
Martinez, 26, and said they were also investigating whether yet another man, 
Jose A. Aguilar, 24, of Santa Ana, might have been wrongly charged during 
Operation Roundup. 
</P>
<P>
 Court records show that an informant testified that Aguilar sold him drugs on 
one occasion during the sting operation. Yet, Aguilar was indicted on two drug 
sale charges, according to court records, a discrepancy that Jensen said his 
office is reviewing. Aguilar was in custody more than two weeks before he was 
released on his own recognizance. 
</P>
<P>
 Aguilar's sister-in-law, Marta Aguilar, said Tuesday that the arrest has been 
hard on her family. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are a bit disturbed by what happened," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Operation Roundup used federal informant Henry Gomez, who has a long history 
of crime and who admitted stealing from investigators during the sting 
operation, to purchase drugs while a videotape was made of the alleged 
transactions. Gomez then helped police identify the suspects through photos.

VOLUNTEERS HELP GAYS AND LESBIANS TO WORK THINGS 'OUT'; SEXUALITY: THEY LEND 
ADVICE OR JUST A SYMPATHETIC EAR FOR CALLERS STRUGGLING WITH THEIR OWN 
ORIENTATION OR THAT OF A LOVED ONE DURING 'NATIONAL COMING OUT DAY.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 When Jack Hill, 37, a firefighter in Orange, wrote an article for a local gay 
magazine about how he "came out" to his friends and family, he thought only 
gays and lesbians would read it. 
</P>
<P>
 But then fellow firefighters picked up a copy of the Blade and read Hill's 
confession. 
</P>
<P>
 The other firemen were understanding and Hill found that he had been keeping a 
large part of his life secret when he really need not have. 
</P>
<P>
 To help others accept their sexual orientation or tell friends, relatives or 
co-workers about it, Hill joined about a dozen other people Tuesday answering 
calls on a "Coming Out" help line at the Gay and Lesbian Community Services 
Center of Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 The one-day help line was part of support activities put on by gay service 
organizations and on college campuses across the country for "National Coming 
Out Day." The day began in 1988 as a commemoration of the Oct. 11, 1987, March 
on Washington for Gay and Lesbian Rights. 
</P>
<P>
 The goal of Orange County's help line volunteers was to serve as listeners to 
people struggling with their own sexual orientation or that of a loved one. 
</P>
<P>
 They told their own stories or detailed how they had reacted when their 
children or siblings delivered the news to them. They also gave out phone 
numbers for local gay and lesbian religious, social and athletic organizations 
and information on HIV testing. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's easier to first come out to someone you don't know and who you can hang 
up on," said Brenda Baker of Aliso Viejo who, with her partner Kimberly Syre, 
came up with the idea for the Orange County help line. "You can't have a 
positive self-image if you don't get any positive feedback." 
</P>
<P>
 Volunteers said they were disappointed that many of the almost 100 calls were 
hang-ups or mistaken calls from people whose friends, or enemies, had paged 
them with the help line number. 
</P>
<P>
 But with every third call or so, they got to help callers looking for advice 
and support. 
</P>
<P>
 One couple told them that hours earlier they had kicked their son out of the 
house when he told them he was gay. They wanted to know how else they should 
have reacted. 
</P>
<P>
 Help line volunteer Pam Woody, whose 25-year-old son Mark told her two years 
ago that he was gay, said abandoning a family member because of sexual 
orientation is common but something she finds disturbing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want people to know that there's really not much different in being gay or 
lesbian," said Woody, toying with a pink triangle on a chain around her neck. 
"Homosexuality isn't just about sex. It's about falling in love, just like we 
heterosexuals do." 
</P>
<P>
 Woody said she didn't accept her son's gayness right away. It took her several 
months before she overcame the initial shock of thinking Mark would lead a 
"desolate, lonely life" and realized she loved him no matter whom he chose to 
live with. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the first year the center has coordinated with the Orange County 
chapter of Parents and Friends of Lesbians and Gays to run the help line. The 
members said they hope to run another talk line next October, this time with 
more response. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they're off to a good start," said Pat Callahan, who works with the 
Lesbian & Gay Leadership Federation of Orange County. "There's a real need. If 
someone is ready to take a particular step in the coming-out process, they need 
to have a place to check in with."

ANAHEIM OKS $250,000 FOR AT-RISK YOUTH PROGRAMS; RECREATION: CHURCH-BASED GROUP 
ASKED FOR FUNDS TO STEM VIOLENCE AND GANG ACTIVITY. THE APPROPRIATION IS A 
ONE-TIME DONATION FROM THE CITY TO LAUNCH THE PROGRAM. 
</P>

<P>
 Hoping to curb violence and gang activity, the City Council on Tuesday 
approved more than $250,000 worth of after-school programs. 
</P>
<P>
 The council's action was applauded by more than 50 members of a grass-roots 
interfaith group which helped to develop the proposals, but the amount of 
funding fell far short of of the $750,000 they had requested for a full slate 
of programs. 
</P>
<P>
 "There has been a good deal of cooperation, but they are saying there is only 
$250,000, and we are not happy about that," said Rev. John Lenihan, pastor of 
St. Boniface Catholic Church in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 Lenihan was among the representatives from the Orange County Congregation 
Community Organization, an interfaith group representing 15 churches 
countywide, which proposed the programs after extensive research. 
</P>
<P>
 The council approved a total of $251,843 to pay for the addition of sports 
activities to the Kids In Action anti-gang program, the hiring of an outreach 
worker to work with female gang members, the expansion of a recreation program 
at George Washington Community Center from summer to year-round, the addition 
of a sixth day at the city's boxing club, and the scheduling of at least eight 
special events at the George Washington Community Center focusing on human 
services, employment and the arts. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the items not funded were a proposed youth employment service, a teen 
center, a homework center, a computer lab, and evening sports leagues. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the organization met with Mayor Tom Daly in June and complained 
that gang violence has increased sharply in recent years, while the city has 
made deep cuts in its Parks and Recreation Department programs. 
</P>
<P>
 The church-based organization lists more than 50,000 families in Orange County 
as members. 
</P>
<P>
 They developed what they call the "Anaheim Youth Vision Platform" after 
conducting a survey and holding 54 meetings with experts in education, law 
enforcement and crime prevention to get to the root of the city's youth 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
 City staff was directed in June to analyze and evaluate the group's platform. 
They met with organization leaders several times throughout the summer and 
prioritized the group's requests with input from the Citizens Gang/Task Force, 
said Christopher K. Jarvi, director of parks, recreation and human services. 
</P>
<P>
 Jarvi said there was not enough money in the city's budget to cover all of the 
programs, and that city staff proposed to fund those geared for children 12 and 
under. 
</P>
<P>
 The money allocated by the council is one-time funding to launch the programs 
and would not be available every year, Jarvi said. He said future revenue could 
come from the federal crime bill recently approved by Congress, the city's 
Community Block Grant Program, and grants. 
</P>
<P>
 Lenihan said he is optimistic that the programs will succeed and continue to 
be funded each year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're convinced it's going to show its worth," he said. "We're trying to make 
the rubber hit the road and have there be definitive contact with these kids." 
</P>
<P>
 Daly asked city staff to continue to explore ways to try and fund the 
remainder of the programs proposed. City Manager James D. Ruth said the city 
would have a better idea in January what next year's budget picture will look 
like. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we're making great strides," Daly said.

<P>
 A man suspected of shoplifting a 12-pack of beer died Tuesday after struggling 
with a bystander who chased the man to a nearby parking lot, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Just before noon, 26-year-old Cipriano Martinez Vasquez entered K's Market, in

ACCOUNTING FIRMS TO PAY NEWPORT-MESA SCHOOLS $525,000; SETTLEMENT: MONEY 
COMPENSATES FOR THEIR FAILURE TO DETECT EMBEZZLEMENT BY FORMER DISTRICT 
FINANCIAL OFFICER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Newport-Mesa Unified School District will receive $525,000 in settlements 
from two accounting firms that failed to discover embezzlement by the 
district's former chief financial officer. 
</P>
<P>
 Board President Edward Decker announced the settlements, which preempt a 
district lawsuit, at the board's meeting Tuesday evening. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach-based Lemke & McDade Certified Public Accountants and its 
principals, Michael McDade and Eric Lemke, will pay $325,000. The firm acted as 
the district's auditor from July, 1988, to June, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 The multinational firm KMPG Peat Marwick, which acted as outside auditor from 
June, 1982, to July, 1988, will pay $200,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Because no lawsuit was filed, no specific allegations were ever made against 
the firms, district director of fiscal services Michael Fine said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The person who caused the loss was Stephen Wagner," Fine said, but the 
district and the accountants "both felt in some sense there was some form of 
responsibility here." 
</P>
<P>
 A district attorney's investigation revealed Wagner's $3.7-million 
embezzlement in October, 1992. Wagner was convicted of the theft and is serving 
a prison sentence. He has not yet paid any restitution, Fine said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wagner's personal bankruptcy proceedings are pending, and Fine said Wagner's 
assets that have been sold have not brought market value.

WOMAN, 72, KILLED IN HER VAN NUYS HOME BY BURGLAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A 72-year-old woman was killed when she startled a burglar in her home Tuesday 
morning, police said, becoming the second elderly woman apparently killed by a 
burglar in Van Nuys in three days. 
</P>
<P>
 There was "absolutely no connection" between the two slayings of the elderly 
women, said Detective Stephen Fisk of the Los Angeles Police Department, who 
said evidence at the two crime scenes points to at least two different killers. 
</P>
<P>
 Aliza Levi was killed Tuesday at the home she shared with her husband, Zvi, in 
the 7900 block of Norwich Avenue, Fisk said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police declined to say how Levi was killed. 
</P>
<P>
 Zvi Levi told police he left the house to run errands at 10 a.m., and when he 
returned at 12:30 p.m. "he found her dead in the house," Fisk said. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday, Berneda McMackin, 77, was found dead in her smoke-filled Van Nuys 
home. She had been stabbed and beaten, then her body was set afire in an 
attempt to hide the crime, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 No suspects have been arrested in the slaying of McMackin, which police said 
was committed during what may have been a burglary. 
</P>
<P>
 In Levi's killing, police are searching for a Latino in his early 20s, about 5 
feet, 7 inches tall, with curly brown hair, seen by a neighbor running from the 
house around noon, Fisk said. The same man may have committed a series of 
burglaries in the neighborhood in the last few months, Fisk said. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors said they saw a transient hanging around the tree-lined neighborhood 
of older single-family homes looking for work last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Juan Sosa, who lives next door to the Levis, said a transient broke into his 
home last month but fled, taking some recyclables from Sosa's garage, when 
Sosa's 80-year-old mother saw him and screamed. 
</P>
<P>
 Shocked by the killing, Sosa said his wife wants to move out of the 
neighborhood as soon as possible.

BURBANK ENDS ITS TIES WITH MEDIA CITY CENTER; DEVELOPMENT: ONLY $10 MILLION 
INVESTED IN TROUBLED SHOPPING MALL IS RECOVERED. DEAL IS LIKELY TO MAKE LITTLE 
DIFFERENCE TO PATRONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VIVIEN LOU CHEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Burbank City Council voted unanimously Tuesday to end the city's 
involvement with the financially troubled Media City Center shopping mall, 
recovering for the city's treasury only $10 million of at least $69.2 million 
Burbank invested in the project. 
</P>
<P>
 For shoppers at the mall, the deal is likely to make little difference. 
</P>
<P>
 But for city officials, a $10-million payment for Burbank's interest provides 
a quick cash infusion from a project that -- by some estimates -- was not 
expected to turn a profit for the city until at least 2013 anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the city's present agreement with developer Alexander Haagen, Burbank is 
supposed to collect 50% of the net operating income from the center's revenues 
after debt payments. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Media City Center has not generated any money for the city -- aside 
from $1.5 million annually in sales taxes -- since it opened in 1989. City 
officials blame revenue shortfalls of about $35 million so far on the 
recession, a weak real estate market, and the mall's vacancy rate of between 
30% and 40% this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ten million dollars is a good return to the city. It's wiser to accept it 
now," said Community Development Director Bob Tague. "The alternative is not to 
do anything and get nothing . . . No one ever anticipated anyone would get 
repaid 100% for our investment." 
</P>
<P>
 That argument does not impress City Hall observer Ted McConkey, who says city 
officials are trying to bail out of a bad business deal that allowed Haagen an 
exemption from city property taxes, among other things. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are, in Biblical terms, essentially selling our heritage for a mess of 
pottage," he said. "We're taking pennies on the dollar for that project." 
</P>
<P>
 The buyout plan is the latest twist to Burbank's long and often frustrating 
quest for a vibrant, thriving mall. 
</P>
<P>
 At least $120.7 million was poured into the project in the hope that a new 
shopping mall, with its adjacent properties developed as well, would revitalize 
downtown Burbank. Some $51 million of the amount was in loans the city expects 
to be repaid. 
</P>
<P>
 To some extent, it's worked. Restaurants and movie theaters in Burbank 
Village, for example, enjoy strong weekend crowds. Yet most of the mall is 
virtually empty on weekdays and whether it will ever fully come alive is open 
to debate. 
</P>
<P>
 Originally, city officials envisioned a first-class shopping center with a 
sit-down restaurant, a top-notch hotel and high-rise office towers with plenty 
of white-collar workers needing a place to shop and dine. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed hotel and offices were believed to be crucial for luring 
potential consumers to ensure that city officials would one day see a profit. 
</P>
<P>
 But that plan was scaled back considerably during the recession, with council 
members allowing Haagen to build a fast-food eatery and Circuit City and Office 
Depot stores near the mall instead of the restaurant, hotel and office towers. 
</P>
<P>
 To help repay about $133 million of debt on the project, the Alexander Haagen 
Co. went public last year, raising $374 million in capital from investors 
around the world by offering stock. Haagen placed almost all his Manhattan 
Beach-based firm -- which has 36 properties throughout Southern California -- 
into a real estate investment trust and sold shares in the trust. 
</P>
<P>
 A REIT works somewhat like a mutual fund: Money from a number of investors, 
who buy stock, is pooled to buy property or make loans. REITs are attractive to 
some because they offer potentially high dividend yields and the shares can be 
bought or sold in stock markets. 
</P>
<P>
 While the REIT settled the issue of long-term financing for the Media City 
Center, it raised another question: Did going public with the Alexander Haagen 
Co. constitute a sale of the mall, which would have required the city's 
permission. 
</P>
<P>
 Tague and Fred Bruning, a senior vice president for Haagen's company, said the 
buyout was just one way of settling the matter, by compensating the city and 
bypassing the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "We honestly felt it was a sale. The city felt it was a financing," Bruning 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 As it stands now, the city still owns the 41 acres that the shopping center 
sits on and will continue to collect millions of dollars in sales taxes, but 
forfeits its right to lease payments for the land in return for the $10-million 
settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 "If our project was not built, the city would be getting zero return," Bruning 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tague acknowledged that the Media City Center was not expected to generate 
profits for the city immediately, and would never bring in more than $10 
million in net operating income for the city under current projections. 
</P>
<P>
 Consequently, he added, the $10-million buyout makes sense. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think this is a good opportunity," Tague said. "There's no one to blame. 
There's nothing wrong with this deal."

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS; BEILENSON BACKS DEMOCRATS IN DEBATE WITH GOP'S SYBERT; 
CONGRESS: THE REMARKS COME DURING THE FIRST MEETING BETWEEN THE 61-YEAR-OLD 
INCUMBENT AND HIS 42-YEAR-OLD REPUBLICAN FOE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 In a surprising break from Democratic incumbents nationwide who are attempting 
to distance themselves from the Clinton Administration, Rep. Anthony C. 
Beilenson (D-Woodland Hills) Tuesday defended the President and the Democratic 
Congress for their efforts to fight budget deficits and crime.  
</P>
<P>
 Beilenson's remarks came during his first debate with GOP rival Richard Sybert 
for the 24th District seat and raised eyebrows in the Sybert camp. "He's 
running against the conventional wisdom," said James Vaughn, Sybert's campaign 
manager. "The Democrats are supposed to flee from Clinton, not embrace him." 
</P>
<P>
 But Tuesday, Beilenson, seeking his 10th term, proudly ticked off a laundry 
list of Clinton legislative initiatives approved by Congress and contrasted 
these "decent successes" with the legacy of stalemate on health care, family 
leave, gun control and deficit reduction left by the Reagan and Bush 
administrations. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fact is that your government has been more responsive" in the past two 
years even though the news media has failed to say so, Beilenson told 125 
senior citizens at the debate sponsored by the West Valley Jewish Community 
Center. "I hope it'll make you feel we should continue the change we've started 
in Washington." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Sybert told those in the audience that if they approved of 
Democratic attempts to resurrect failed Great Society programs, raise taxes and 
expand government, "then you shouldn't vote for me." Sybert is an attorney and 
businessman who was a top aide to Gov. Pete Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 Another big difference between Beilenson and himself, Sybert said, is "I have 
never run for office before in my life, and my opponent has done nothing else." 
One of the nation's biggest problems "is career politicians from both parties," 
added Sybert, who, unlike Beilenson, supports congressional term limits. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday's meeting between the candidates was the first in a number of debates 
scheduled for the final four weeks before the election. 
</P>
<P>
 Beilenson and Sybert, both Harvard-educated, put on strong, fact-filled and 
articulate performances for the seniors gathered at Temple Aliyah in West Hills 
for the debate. 
</P>
<P>
 During his opening remarks, the 61-year-old incumbent strongly praised the 
Clinton budget deficit-reduction plan for slowing the flood of red ink and 
shrinking the federal payroll while noting it was approved "without a single 
Republican vote." 
</P>
<P>
 Beilenson also boasted that Congress, with Clinton leading, finally had the 
courage to pass the Brady handgun registration bill and a ban on certain 
military-style assault rifles despite opposition from the National Rifle Assn.; 
had provided $30 billion to fight crime, including money for local police 
agencies to hire 100,000 more officers, and had expanded the fight against 
illegal immigration by voting to double the size of the Border Patrol. 
</P>
<P>
 Beilenson said he also authored an amendment to the crime bill that now 
earmarks $1.8 billion to reimburse states for their cost of imprisoning illegal 
immigrants. "That will save the taxpayers of this state alone three-quarters of 
a billion dollars," Beilenson said. 
</P>
<P>
 For his part, the 42-year-old challenger blasted the crime bill, saying it was 
full of "tired old Great Society" prevention programs, such as midnight 
basketball recreational opportunities. The only difference midnight basketball 
will make is that "your homes will be burgled at 2 o'clock in the morning when 
you're asleep," Sybert said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sybert also hit Beilenson as "one of a handful" of congressmen who voted 
against U.S. military intervention in the 1991 Persian Gulf War, a move he said 
was "not helpful" to Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 Sybert marked out a tough stand on illegal immigration, saying he would not 
vote for "bilingual anything." As a member of the governing board of the Santa 
Monica Mountains Conservancy, he had proposed an English-only rule for all 
conservancy literature. Sybert also supports Proposition 187, the November 
ballot measure to deny key benefits to illegal immigrants; Beilenson opposes 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 After blaming the Reagan-Bush budget deficits on congressional Democrats who 
refused to cut government bureaucracy and program fat, Beilenson became 
agitated and -- in the candidates' most tense exchange -- demanded to know what 
Sybert would cut. "I'd vote to cut the salary increases for Congress that 
you've voted for," Sybert shot back. "Talk real money," flared Beilenson. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he is not a practicing Jew, Sybert told the mostly Jewish audience 
Tuesday that his mother, Mildred Lerner, would have been so "kvell" (proud) to 
see him at a temple. "I haven't been in a temple since I was 12 years old," he 
said, grinning.

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: RALLY URGES DISTRICT NOT TO MOVE TEACHERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAKI BECKER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 About 150 parents, students and teachers representing at least 18 schools 
staged a rally Tuesday in front of quake-ravaged apartment complexes to urge 
school officials not to transfer teachers because of low enrollment. 
</P>
<P>
 The empty "ghost town" apartments in Granada Hills provided an appropriate 
setting for the rally, organizers said, because the enrollment decrease in San 
Fernando Valley schools this fall is blamed chiefly on the Jan. 17 Northridge 
earthquake. Many families whose homes were damaged or destroyed in the temblor 
are expected to return within six months, once their homes are repaired, they 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since Jan. 17, we have apartments that were downed or destroyed. . . . A lot 
of those people were displaced . . . and since we came back (to school) 
enrollment's been down. Surprise! Surprise!" said Mandy Ritzmann, co-chairwoman 
of the Calahan Street Elementary School PTSA in Northridge and organizer of the 
rally. 
</P>
<P>
 As the year goes on and more apartments and houses are repaired, families will 
return with their kids and then overpopulate the schools, Ritzmann and other 
parents argued. 
</P>
<P>
 They fear teachers will be transferred because, when too few students are 
enrolled at a school, the Los Angeles Unified School District traditionally 
transfers teachers out of that school to one that has too many students. The 
main reason for moving the teachers, said school board member Julie Korenstein, 
is that teachers' salaries come from the money that is given to a school for 
each child enrolled there. 
</P>
<P>
 The district will take a final enrollment count Friday, four weeks after the 
first day of school. 
</P>
<P>
 Korenstein announced at the rally that schools enrolling students who have 
been transferred from overcrowded schools will probably not lose their 
teachers. In addition, Korenstein said district Supt. Sid Thompson will be 
looking at each school's enrollment to assess whether quake displacement 
actually figures in that school's situation. 
</P>
<P>
 Korenstein also reported that schools that are short by about seven students 
or fewer will be able to keep all of their teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 However, where the money to keep teachers will come from has not been 
determined, according to Korenstein. The school board is looking into applying 
for more federal disaster assistance or using the $1 million that Thompson set 
aside to develop a leadership training course for school officials and staff. 
</P>
<P>
 Teacher Carroll Gelberg of El Oro Way Elementary School in Granada Hills said 
she may be transferred out of her fourth- and fifth-grade class after Friday 
because the school is six children short of its designated enrollment level. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know I'm the one with the lowest priority," said Gelberg, the newest 
teacher at El Oro. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have 29 students in my class and we're still 'short,' " she added. 
</P>
<P>
 One of her students, Jessica Westerbrook, 9, said she feels sad that she may 
lose her teacher. "She's special and nice and funny," said Jessica, who urged 
community members to consider sending their children to El Oro instead of to 
private schools so that the school can keep all of its teachers. MAKI BECKER

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: COLLEGE TO OFFER ACCELERATED CLASSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MANNING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Pierce College has introduced a program to reduce the length of a semester 
from 16 to eight weeks to help students meet their educational objectives 
faster. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to help students get through college as quickly as possible because a 
two-year education should be just that -- it should take two years," said 
William Norlund, vice president of academic affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 The program differs from traditional eight-week courses offered by the school 
in that the amount of time spent in classrooms has been doubled, said Ina 
Geller, Pierce spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
 "You are actually getting 16 weeks of instruction because the courses meet for 
longer periods," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, a course that normally meets for three hours a week meets for six 
hours under the new program. 
</P>
<P>
 Courses available under the accelerated program are history, philosophy, 
political science, sociology, economics, English, anthropology and geography. 
Most begin Monday and can be used toward an associate of arts degree or to 
transfer to a four-year college. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the program, students who did not get classes they needed at the 
beginning of the semester have first dibs, Geller said. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are high-demand courses," she said. "If a student couldn't get it when 
they registered in the fall, now they have another chance." 
</P>
<P>
 There was a special registration period for those students Monday and Tuesday. 
New students can register for any courses left over today through Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 For information, call the admissions office at (818) 719-6404. 
</P>
<P>
 Many students have taken longer that two years to get their associate degrees 
because they failed to get the classes they needed, Geller said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ultimately, we want students to be able to get their education here on their 
timetable and not have to wait to get into classes," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The new program, Geller said, is also designed to boost enrollment, which has 
dropped from 20,000 students to 15,000 over five years. 
</P>
<P>
 "It shows the commitment of our new president, Dr. Mary Lee, to enhance the 
educational program at Pierce College," Geller added. "We want the new students 
and continuing students to realize that we understand what their needs are and 
what their goals are." FRANK MANNING

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: CLUNKER CARS ARE TREASURE FOR CHARITY 
</P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Of course you want to rid your yard -- or your neighbor's -- of at least a 
couple of those wrecked Mercuries and feebly-running Dodge Darts. But towing 
costs more than the clunkers are worth. 
</P>
<P>
 Not anymore. A Los Angeles nonprofit group will haul off that ancient Pacer -- 
or even last year's still-shiny Mercedes -- for free, and in the process 
support mentally disabled Southlanders. Vehicle owners may even be eligible for 
a tax write-off. 
</P>
<P>
 Running or not, with or without doors, any car is eligible. "We'd be happy to 
take it," said Karen Segal of Best Buddies Inc., which will tow the vehicle, 
sell it whole or recycle it for parts or scrap metal. The dollars it brings are 
used to run a program that aims to build one-on-one relationships between 
mentally disabled people and area college students. 
</P>
<P>
 "What Best Buddies seeks to do is create these special friendships," Segal 
said. Students spend time with their buddies, who are otherwise often 
housebound and friendless. 
</P>
<P>
 Now operating across the United States and in several other countries, the 
organization is led by Anthony Kennedy Shriver, who started it in 1987 at 
Georgetown University. 
</P>
<P>
 While Best Buddies has been in place at several Southern California 
universities and colleges since 1989, it receives most of its funding from 
federal grants and special events.  
</P>
<P>
 To have a vehicle towed, owners need only prove that it belongs to them and 
"not their ex-boyfriend," Segal said, and it will be whisked away -- in two 
hours or less. 
</P>
<P>
 Owners also will be given papers that explain how they may be able to write 
off as a donation the blue-book value of the vehicle on their next tax return. 
</P>
<P>
 In the San Fernando Valley and throughout Los Angeles, call (800) 213-8800 to 
participate. ERIC SLATER

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: POLICE SWEEP NETS 38 TRUANT STUDENTS

<TEXT>
<P>
 In a sweep of West San Fernando Valley teen-age hangouts, police picked up 38 
truant high school and middle school students Tuesday and returned them to 
class. 
</P>
<P>
 Sgt. Dan Mastro of the Los Angeles Police Department West Valley Division said 
that police conducted the sweep because they "had a lot of complaints coming 
from business owners." 
</P>
<P>
 "Burglaries have increased slightly in the Ventura Boulevard area," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Five police officers in three squad cars swept through school areas, checking 
side streets, malls, fast-food places and other hangouts between 8 a.m. and 
noon. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the truants caught, eight were from Parkman Middle School in Woodland 
Hills; five from Cleveland High School in Reseda; 10 from Taft High School in 
Woodland Hills; 10 from Canoga Park High School, and three from Reseda High 
School. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of the teen-agers caught in the sweep were Chatsworth High School 
students, which is outside of the West Valley Division area. 
</P>
<P>
 Mastro said police "hope it will be a learning experience" for the truant 
students. However, he said not all the students who were playing hooky Tuesday 
morning were caught. "We had a lot that ran from us," Mastro said. "We didn't 
get them. We'll get them another day." Parkman Middle School Principal Michael 
Bennett said he was delighted with the police action. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is good," said Bennett, who added that the eight students caught in the 
sweep will each perform six hours of community service, such as helping clean 
lunch tables or working with the anti-graffiti program Operation Sparkle. ED

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE; ANTI-PROP. 187 FORUM HOSTED BY STUDENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Latino students at Glendale Community College waged war Tuesday on the 
so-called "Save Our State" initiative, calling it a calculated, cynical plan 
concocted by Gov. Pete Wilson and other Republicans to win the "anti-immigrant 
vote." 
</P>
<P>
 The college's ethnic studies department and the Assn. of Latin American 
Students held a four-hour forum on Proposition 187, with panelists discussing 
the impact on California's education, health care, welfare and other programs 
if the initiative -- which would deny most public benefits to illegal 
immigrants -- passes. 
</P>
<P>
 "This will not solve the immigration problem. There's no money for building 
big walls or increasing the Border Patrol," said Jimmy Franco, of the League of 
United Latin American Citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 He accused conservative backers of the initiative of using illegal immigrants 
as a "scapegoat" to avoid addressing the causes of California's recession -- 
unemployment, homelessness and other problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Other panelists said the initiative would force about 150,000 students in the 
greater Los Angeles area out of public schools, create a "public health crisis" 
as illegal immigrants are refused health care except in emergencies, and foster 
a "climate of suspicion" in which teachers, social workers and others would be 
required to report possible illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to be a surrogate INS agent," said Judy London, an attorney with 
a social service agency for Central American refugees. "Nobody should be an 
agent of the INS unless they are employed by the INS." 
</P>
<P>
 The group also noted a report by the nonpartisan state Legislative Analyst's 
Office indicating that California could lose about $15 billion a year in income 
taxes, school funding and other revenues if the initiative passes. 
</P>
<P>
 The college students hoped to present a united front to counteract the strong 
showing the proposition has made in recent opinion polls among likely voters. 
</P>
<P>
 But some in the audience said the presentation was too one-sided. Tich Tran, 
19, an Asian American student, said illegal immigrants should not be entitled 
to the same benefits as U. S. citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not supposed to present only one side of the story. We need to present 
both sides so the students can make up their own minds," said Jiwon Moore, a 
sociology instructor at the college. "Instead of debating the issue, this will 
only cause more anger for the students that are thinking of voting yes on 187." 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents conceded that it may pass Nov. 8, but if so, they predicted that it 
will be challenged in court and ultimately overturned as unconstitutional by 
the U. S. Supreme Court. And if it does pass, they said they will refuse to 
abide by it. 
</P>
<P>
 "As professors we will be required to ask our students for the documentation 
before we begin our lectures," said Carlos Ugalde, an instructor of ethnic 
studies. 
</P>
<P>
 "I personally will not ask my students for their documents," he said. "And I 
don't think there's going to be enough jails (to accommodate) all the people 
who are going to be refusing." STEVE RYFLE

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: PACOIMA; FAMILY MARKET CELEBRATES 50TH YEAR OF SUCCESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF SCHNAUFER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If you ask Dan Tresierras what it takes to make a family-owned Latino food 
market last 50 years in the mean streets of Pacoima, he'll tell you to start 
with a good mother. 
</P>
<P>
 "My mother was a real entrepreneur," said Tresierras, the eldest of three 
brothers who run the family's chain of Tresierras Brothers markets. "She used 
to make little ice cubes and sell them. She really wanted a store." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1944, Pilar Canchola Tresierras got her wish. Her husband, Frank 
Tresierras, opened his first market on Kalisher Street in San Fernando. After 
World War II, the family moved the market to Pacoima, where the three brothers 
-- Dan, Richard and James -- began working in the store as teen-agers, often 12 
hours a day. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, the three brothers gathered at Market No. 2 on San Fernando Road 
in Pacoima to celebrate the 50th anniversary of their parents' endeavor. The 
enterprise has grown to four markets known from Newhall to Van Nuys for meat 
and produce catering to Latino tastes, from Cuban-style platanos (cooked 
plaintains) to Milanesa (thin-sliced Mexican-style steak). 
</P>
<P>
 The celebration drew the praise of local dignitaries, including U.S. Rep. 
Howard L. Berman (D-Panorama City), who presented the brothers with a flag 
flown over the nation's capitol to honor the store's 50th anniversary. 
</P>
<P>
 Joel Rucker, president of the Pacoima Chamber of Commerce, said the market 
stands as a symbol to all Pacoima merchants. "It's such a constantly changing 
community," Rucker said. "This is a landmark achievement." 
</P>
<P>
 Although their parents died several years ago, Dan Tresierras said the three 
brothers have followed their parents' philosophy of cultural integration. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexican pinatas line the checkout stand, frozen french fries fill the freezer, 
and favorites on both side of the border, such as chicken fajitas, are sold by 
the butcher. About the only Mexican tradition every shopper experiences are the 
canciones, or Mexican songs, resonating from the market's speakers. 
</P>
<P>
 During the next 50 years, the Tresierras brothers are banking on a new 
generation, as more and more Central Americans integrate into the community 
surrounding their stores. 
</P>
<P>
 One new customer is Olvin Delgado, 22, of Sun Valley. Born and reared in 
Honduras, Delgado comes to Tresierras for the black beans he grew up on while 
his wife, Mexican-born Anna, shops for chorizo, Mexican sausage. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are some things here that you can't find at other stores," Delgado 
said. "And I don't mind the Mexican music." JEFF SCHNAUFER

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: LITTLE TUJUNGA CANYON; REFUGE EDUCATES ABOUT WILD ANIMALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ED BOND

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Urban humans can live in peace with wild animals; it's just a question of how, 
said a volunteer with the Wildlife Waystation, a wild animal refuge in Little 
Tujunga Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot of conflict going on between man and animals," said Larry 
Baron, volunteer director who oversees off-ranch activities for the refuge. "We 
want to try to teach as best we can how to live with wild animals." 
</P>
<P>
 As cities take over former wilderness areas and habitable land for wild 
animals shrinks, the conflict between human and beast can increase, Baron said. 
But, he said, people can take precautions to protect themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives of the Wildlife Waystation and other animal-care organizations 
and facilities will discuss the conflict and offer solutions for it Sunday at 
an Animal Survival Day at Rio Hondo College in Whittier. The event, from 9 a.m. 
to 2 p.m., is also intended to make the public aware of the plight of animals. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wildlife Waystation cares for more than 1,000 native and exotic animals 
from all over the nation. Animals rescued by the facility include many that had 
been pets, originally bought by people who wrongly thought that if they got the 
animal young enough they could tame it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then, they realize they have taken on more than they can chew," Baron said. 
</P>
<P>
 The refuge offers a home of last resort for wild animals that have been 
orphaned, and volunteers also act as surrogate mothers to hand-raise and 
bottle-feed hundreds of baby animals before they can be returned to the wild. 
</P>
<P>
 The facility has 35 hybrid wolves, a mixture of wolf and dog, which usually 
are routinely destroyed by animal control officers because they have no place 
in either the wild or in civilization, Baron said. 
</P>
<P>
 Baron said volunteers at the refuge also try to educate the public about how 
to deal with coyotes who may prey on pets in populated mountain regions. 
</P>
<P>
 "You must make sure your pets are always protected," Baron said. "You don't do 
anything to attract the animals." 
</P>
<P>
 The Wildlife Waystation gives tours for schoolchildren to learn firsthand 
about the plight of wild animals. ED BOND

<P>
 Between 30 and 40 representatives of private and public sector businesses are 
expected at Mission College's 1994 job fair, "Focus on Careers." 
</P>
<P>
 Students and community members will have a chance to meet with employers, 
career counselors and education professionals at the fair, to be held from 10 
a.m. to 1 p.m. Oct. 26 at the college's campus center. 
</P>
<P>
 Seminars will be offered on topics including resume writing, interviewing 
techniques, how to find a job in the federal government, and developing job 
search strategies. 
</P>
<P>
 "This the third year we've held the fair -- once each semester -- and it's 
getting bigger and bigger," said Geri Shapiro, a counselor in the college's New 
Horizons Program.  
</P>
<P>
 Information will be available on the college's two-year certificate and 
associate arts degree programs in culinary arts, gerontology, administration of 
justice, child development, computer science, business and professional 
administration, interior design, physics, astronomy and engineering, among 
others. A new program in intergenerational care also is being offered this 
year, Shapiro said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're welcoming everybody who wants help on how to select a career or get a 
job. It's free of charge," Shapiro said.  
</P>
<P>
 "People can bring their resumes in and get help, or they can sit in a mock 
interview and receive a videotaped critique. Some people have been known to 
line up jobs -- some of the companies who come are actively recruiting." TIM

PAIR FOUND DEAD WERE STRANGLED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two bodies found over the weekend had been taped up, bound in plastic trash 
bags and strangled, homicide investigators said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department investigators have identified one of 
the victims, but withheld the name until relatives were notified, said Lt. Ray 
Peavy, one of three detectives investigating the double slaying. 
</P>
<P>
 The body of the second victim has not been identified, he said. Investigators 
also are trying to determine the nationality of both victims, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Peavy said the deaths have the look of an organized crime killing. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems like they wanted to send a message to somebody or get their 
attention," Peavy said. 
</P>
<P>
 Because one of the victims, a 25-year-old man, was a convicted drug dealer, 
"They may have been involved in some narcotics trafficking when this occurred," 
Peavy said. 
</P>
<P>
 The bodies were discovered in underbrush along Lopez Canyon Road at about 10 
a.m. Saturday by bicyclists, authorities said.

TESTIMONY BEGINS IN NORTHRIDGE, CANYON COUNTRY BANK HEISTS; CRIME: BRANCH 
OFFICERS AND THEIR FAMILIES WERE TAKEN HOSTAGE. WOMEN WERE FORCED TO LET 
ROBBERS INTO BRANCHS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A federal prosecutor told a jury Tuesday that a Santa Clarita man held two 
bank officers and their families hostage overnight and then forced the women to 
help him steal more than $200,000 from their banks -- money that later allowed 
him to buy two cars and travel to Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 The allegations began the trial of Alex Yepes, 25, who stands accused in the 
June 11, 1993, robbery of a TransWorld Bank in Canyon Country and the Sept. 17, 
1993, theft of a Coast Federal branch in Northridge, authorities said.  
</P>
<P>
 He is the first of five suspects to be tried in the heists, which authorities 
said took bank robbery to new extremes. Two others have pleaded guilty and two 
remain at large. 
</P>
<P>
 During opening statements in the trial in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles, 
Assistant U.S. Atty. David R. Fields detailed events surrounding the separate 
but nearly identical robberies. Each allegedly began with Yepes, along with 
several accomplices, holding bank officers hostage in their own homes: 
TransWorld officer Toula Demosthenous and eight others were held in her Canyon 
Country home; Coast Federal officer Terry Duranso and four others were captured 
in her Canoga Park home. 
</P>
<P>
 Fields alleged that Yepes helped guard the bank officers and their family and 
friends until morning, when Yepes and some of his accomplices accompanied the 
women to their banks and forced them to open the vaults and automatic teller 
machines. In all, Yepes and the other men stole about $214,000, Fields said. 
Nobody was injured in either robbery. 
</P>
<P>
 Jurors were told Tuesday that evidence will show that after the robberies 
Yepes used his share of the money to buy two used cars and to take a trip to 
Club Med in Cancun, Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 Fields also said that Yepes confessed to his brother-in-law that he had robbed 
the TransWorld Bank, and that one of Yepes' accomplices, who has pleaded guilty 
to his involvement in the robberies, will testify against him during the trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Moments later, Gerald Scotti, an attorney representing Yepes, told jurors that 
evidence will show a different picture from the one painted by Fields, 
contending that his client was with friends during both robberies. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, two terrible crimes were committed. . . . but, no, Alex Yepes wasn't 
present at either of them," Scotti said. 
</P>
<P>
 Scotti acknowledged that Yepes was friends with the men who robbed the banks 
and that they had invited him to participate in the robberies, but the attorney 
contended that his client declined and yet they still turned him in. 
</P>
<P>
 "Their first way out of it was to point the finger at Alex," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Scotti said that on the night before the Northridge heist, Yepes was at a rock 
concert with friends and that ticket receipts, cellular phone records from 
calls Yepes made that night, and auto club records from a flat tire he got on 
the way home will be presented to prove his client went to the concert. 
</P>
<P>
 The attorney also told jurors that the trip to Mexico had been planned in 
advance as had the purchase of the cars, one of which he said his client bought 
with money from a business investment. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities also lack physical evidence to tie Yepes to the crime scenes and a 
search of his home produced no evidence, Scotti said. 
</P>
<P>
 Yepes, who has pleaded not guilty, is the first of five suspects charged in 
the robberies to stand trial.  
</P>
<P>
 If convicted, he faces a maximum sentence of life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, Chad Pelch, 24, was sentenced to 10 years in prison after he 
pleaded guilty to robbery and kidnaping charges stemming from the TransWorld 
robbery in Canyon Country. 
</P>
<P>
 Darren Patrick Towers, of Saugus, who is expected to testify against Yepes, 
pleaded guilty in December to his involvement and was sentenced to 15 years in 
prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Pelch's brother, Brett Pelch, who is charged in both robberies, and Donald 
Sallee, who is charged with participating in the Coast Federal robbery, are 
both 26 and have not been caught.

RESEDA MAN NEARLY LOSES RIGHT TO VOTE AFTER LISTING TARZANA ADDRESS; ELECTION: 
POSTAL SERVICE WARNS VOTERS NOT TO TRY TO UPGRADE NEIGHBORHOODS ON REGISTRATION 
FORMS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Residents of the San Fernando Valley's many communities bicker over boundaries 
and name changes, priding themselves on their differences, until they sometimes 
forget that most of them really live in the city of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, the last day to register to vote in the November election, it was 
just such a fine distinction that almost cost a man his right to vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee H. Greene, 42, said that when he moved to what he thought was Tarzana 
about a month ago, he promptly registered to vote with the County 
Registrar-Recorder, using his new address. 
</P>
<P>
 After weeks of waiting with no response, fearing his application might have 
been lost, Greene called the county office. 
</P>
<P>
 "They told me they received it but were rejecting it because . . . I listed 
Tarzana as my community instead of Reseda," Greene said. 
</P>
<P>
 After a few phone calls, the saga was cleared up for Greene. The registrar's 
office ruled that he could register as a Tarzana resident as long as his 
address in the 6300 block of Tunney Street was correct. 
</P>
<P>
 Registrar spokeswoman Marcia Ventura said officials had confirmed with the 
Regional Post Office in Van Nuys that some residents in Greene's neighborhood 
have been listing their Reseda residences as in Tarzana, and that that was 
officially acceptable to the post office. 
</P>
<P>
 The lesson: Don't try to upgrade to a more prestigious neighborhood on voter 
registration forms. 
</P>
<P>
 "All these areas are actually Los Angeles . . . When they put their own local 
communities (on the application), it slows things down a bit," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 About four years ago, community activists presented the mayor's office with a 
stack of 27 hand-drawn maps of Valley communities hoping the city would make 
the boundaries official. That still hasn't happened. 
</P>
<P>
 "The community map has not been officially adopted by the City Council," said 
Eric Rose, spokesman for Councilwoman Laura Chick's office, whose district 
contains Reseda and parts of Tarzana. "The post office is allowing (residents) 
to call it Tarzana but the map is still in committee right now." 
</P>
<P>
 Because there are no official boundaries for communities in the Valley -- the 
Thomas Bros. guides, police boundaries and postal zones sometimes contradict 
each other -- most boundaries are established by word of mouth and tradition, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, "you can call yourself whatever you want, but everybody lives in 
the city of Los Angeles," said Rose, who handles about one boundary related 
call a month. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura said the registrar's office puts aside many voter registration cards 
that are not completed properly, but rarely has to do so because of community 
boundary disputes. The office is provided with tentative community boundaries 
from the county assessor's office. "They showed the address to be in Reseda," 
Ventura said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tarzana or Reseda, Greene was always in the 24th Congressional District, which 
covers most of the southwestern part of the Valley and he was using an accurate 
ZIP code, which is the criteria for sorting mail, Rose said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have moved twice in the last 10 years and I have never had a problem 
before," Greene said. "I am pretty diligent about voting . . . and if I 
wouldn't have made the phone call, I don't think I would have been registered."

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; NEWHALL WATER DISTRICT PLANS RATE INCREASE

 Earthquake damage and street widening projects are the culprits being named as 
the cause of the first rate increase by the Newhall County Water District in 
eight years. 
</P>
<P>
 The increase, which the agency plans to impose in the next few weeks, will be 
the subject of a public meeting Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's probably going to be about $6 a month for the average household," Robert 
Wade, president of the district's board of directors, said of the increase. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the district needs the money to cover $500,000 to $600,000 worth of 
earthquake damage not covered by federal funds, plus $860,000 to move pipes 
because of road construction. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency hopes to raise the money needed to meet these costs over a 
five-year period, said Lynne Plambeck, another board member. 
</P>
<P>
 Public input from Thursday's meeting could influence the agency's plan, 
however, Plambeck said. 
</P>
<P>
 The meeting will be at 8 p.m. at William S. Hart High School, 24825 Newhall 
Ave. MARK SABBATINI

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; GROUP PLANS RECALL DRIVE AGAINST JUDGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK SABBATINI, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Friends of a slain local man are planning a recall campaign against a judge 
who rejected a jury's recommendation that the convicted murderer receive the 
death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 In April, Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Leon Kaplan ordered a new 
sentencing hearing for Scott Forrest Collins, who was found guilty of the 
execution-style murder of Fred Rose. Rose's friends contend that the judge 
disregarded the jury's recommendation because of his personal objections to the 
death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 "What happened was so shocking to most of us it really motivated us to look at 
the system," said Fred Beach, a friend of Rose and one of the organizers of the 
Santa Clarita-based Rights of Survivors Everywhere group, also known as ROSE. 
</P>
<P>
 Beach said a new penalty-phase hearing will cost hundreds of thousands of 
dollars and will be needlessly painful for Rose's family. 
</P>
<P>
 Collins was convicted Sept. 30, 1993, in Van Nuys Superior Court of kidnaping 
Rose in Lancaster and forcing him to drive to North Hollywood, where a jogger 
found him with fatal bullet wounds in the head. In November, the jury 
recommended that Collins receive the death penalty instead of life in prison 
without the possibility of parole. 
</P>
<P>
 Kaplan, in a prepared statement issued Tuesday, said his ruling was based on 
legal, not personal, factors. 
</P>
<P>
 "Had (I) not followed the law, the case would have been sent back on appeal 
years later, after witnesses are lost and memories are forgotten," he said in 
the statement. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Lea Purwin D'Agostino countered that the judge made 
comments during the case that convinced her he didn't want to sentence Collins 
to death. 
</P>
<P>
 "One day he said to me, 'Why don't you let God make that decision, when this 
defendant should die?' " she said. "I told him, 'Because God didn't let Scott 
Collins decide when Fred Rose should die.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Kaplan said his decision not to issue the death penalty was partly based on 
his determination that two jurors acted improperly during deliberations by 
using a string and protractor to show that Rose was killed execution-style. 
This demonstration possibly influenced other jurors to recommend the death 
sentence, he believed. 
</P>
<P>
 But Greg Beckman Sr., one of the jurors who participated in the demonstration, 
said it did not affect deliberations and that he believes Kaplan is using that 
ruling to cover up his true motives. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think he's a bad judge. I think he's a misguided judge," Beckman 
said. "I don't think he understood fully the obligations he had to our legal 
system." 
</P>
<P>
 Support for Kaplan was expressed by former Los Angeles Police Department Chief 
Ed Davis, who in Kaplan's prepared statement said: "Please do not sign this 
petition. Judge Kaplan is a firm and fair judge. We need him on the bench." 
</P>
<P>
 Rose's widow, Sharon Rose, has moved out of state with their three children. 
In a telephone interview, she expressed support for the recall campaign. "It's 
for the next victim of Judge Leon Kaplan," she said. "It may be too late for 
us, but we don't want anybody else to be victimized." 
</P>
<P>
 Recall petitions against judges are rare, said Grace Romero, a spokeswoman for 
the county registrar-recorder's office. 
</P>
<P>
 She said the only other such recalls she remembers in her 15 years with the 
department were two unsuccessful attempts in 1992 and 1993 to recall Superior 
Court Judge Joyce Karlin, who generated widespread controversy by sentencing a 
Korean-born grocer to probation in the killing of an African American teen-age 
girl. 
</P>
<P>
 ROSE organizers acknowledge that because the case is not well known, 
collecting the more than 307,000 signatures necessary to force a recall 
election will be a daunting task. They hope to mount a campaign to make the 
case better known. 
</P>
<P>
 Beach said he expects the Los Angeles County registrar-recorder's office to 
approve the circulation of the petitions by the end of the month. ROSE will 
have 160 days from the approval date to collect the signatures.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; 2 SUPER SCOOPERS DEMONSTRATE THEIR 
FIREFIGHTING PROWESS; CASTAIC: COUNTY OFFICIALS WATCH FIRST TEST OF THE 
CANADIAN PLANES, WHICH CAN CARRY 1,400 GALLONS OF WATER APIECE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Like giant dragonflies, they alighted Tuesday on the placid blue waters of 
Castaic Lake, scooped up 1,400 gallons apiece and dumped a cascade of water on 
a designated hillside with surgical precision. 
</P>
<P>
 Under ideal conditions -- light winds and calm water -- the first local test 
of the Super Scooper firefighting planes unfolded like an aerial ballet against 
the amphitheater of bone-dry hills. The two planes swooped and pirouetted 
before an audience of firefighters and journalists, finishing each maneuver in 
under two minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 The newest tools in Los Angeles County's firefighting arsenal performed so 
well, in fact, that firefighters were reduced to trading jests for 
entertainment once the initial drama wore off. 
</P>
<P>
 A red-faced fire captain stamped out one false report that had gone out over 
the two-way radio linking firefighters at the test scene: The bright 
yellow-and-red tanker planes did not soak the inside of his pickup truck with 
the equivalent of 140 bathtubs of water sucked from the lake. 
</P>
<P>
 "They just wet the top of the truck," Los Angeles County Fire Capt. Frank Wall 
protested over the radio, squelching previous reports that he had neglected to 
close his truck windows. 
</P>
<P>
 And, although one of the Canadair CL-215Ts dumped a huge plume of water 
suspiciously nearby, journalists who were watching from a knoll above the lake 
stayed completely dry during the two-hour operation. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, a high-ranking county fire official couldn't resist announcing, 
"REPORTERS ALL WET," in a parody of a news headline that was perhaps wishful 
thinking. 
</P>
<P>
 Fire officials were in a jovial mood because this week's tests are the last 
step in the long campaign to bring the highly touted planes to Los Angeles 
County. Unlike other tanker planes and the majority of helicopters that must be 
loaded by ground crews, the Super Scooper can swoop down on a lake or the ocean 
and skim across the surface at about 100 m.p.h. with intake nozzles open, 
taking on seven tons of water in under 12 seconds. The short turnaround between 
reloading and water-bombing runs improves the chances of quickly controlling or 
dousing a fire. 
</P>
<P>
 Although brief tests of the plane were conducted in Los Angeles County more 
than a decade ago, opponents managed to block further testing by arguing that 
the Super Scooper had significant drawbacks, including its purchase price -- 
$16.5 million -- and the fact that it cannot fly at night or in extremely gusty 
winds and cannot get refills from a choppy ocean. 
</P>
<P>
 But last year's devastating fire season gave local homeowner associations and 
other supporters the boost they needed to add the plane to the county Fire 
Department's arsenal. 
</P>
<P>
 With the help of a $500,000 grant from the federal government and a $157,000 
donation from California's insurance industry, the county will lease one plane 
for a maximum of three months from the Quebec government for about $719,000, 
plus $515 for every hour it is in the air. The lease includes the services of 
12 pilots and mechanics. 
</P>
<P>
 The other plane is being donated for county use for three months by Canadair's 
parent company, Bombardier Inc. of Montreal, which hopes to eventually sell 
Super Scoopers to the county and other California jurisdictions. 
</P>
<P>
 The planes will be used throughout the county, not just in the unincorporated 
areas that are the responsibility of county firefighters. They will be tested 
today at Bonelli Park in San Dimas and be ready to go to work Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The tests are being conducted primarily to familiarize ground crews with the 
planes, which hold more than three times the amount of water carried by the 
county's firefighting helicopters. Although the Super Scooper has been used 
successfully for years in Quebec, many fires there occur in remote areas where 
the planes can release their loads without injuring firefighters, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The size of the drop is something that's on our minds," said Mike Aplanalp, a 
county fire suppression aide. "I got hit by a load from a helicopter once and 
it felt like a pretty good size ocean wave." 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday, the planes made 14 runs without incident, dropping the water at 
various speeds and altitudes near 80 firefighters perched on a nearby slope. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials are also concerned about air traffic safety during fires because the 
Super Scoopers will share the skies with firefighting helicopters and other 
tanker planes. 
</P>
<P>
 "There'll be a lot of iron in the sky," said county Fire Chief P. Michael 
Freeman, who observed Tuesday's test. "But I'm confident that the performance 
is there."

FENCING CONTEST; HOMEOWNER BATTLES NEIGHBOR, CITY OVER BARRIER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN POPE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Patsy Barggren thought she had a pretty good argument for erecting the tall 
wood fence around part of her Long Beach home in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Her house had been burglarized several times, cars had been stolen, and she 
had been feuding with a neighbor, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 City inspectors OKd the fence in the early stages of construction. But they 
withdrew the approval after neighbors complained about its final height -- the 
structure is 8-feet tall and the city allows only 6 1/2-foot fences. 
</P>
<P>
 Barggren has continued to defy orders to lower the fence, arguing that many 
residents have fences exceeding the limit. But a jury recently convicted her of 
violating city codes. The actress, who says she has appeared in television soap 
operas, is to be sentenced today in Long Beach Municipal Court and could face 
up to six months in jail, a $500 fine or both. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, I could have just taken the fence down, but I'm not a quitter," Barggren 
said. "I can't let it go. I believe I'm in the right and I've been treated 
wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 Barggren said she spent about $5,000 to build the fence -- and about $25,000 
in legal fees defending it. 
</P>
<P>
 She had it built about three years ago along the side and back of her 
property, which borders the Virginia Country Club in an upscale Bixby Knolls 
neighborhood. Her yard previously had been shielded by shrubbery and a 
chain-link fence. 
</P>
<P>
 George Boucher, a neighbor who often clashed with Barggren, complained to the 
city that the new fence, which is solid and topped with decorative latticework, 
was too high and obstructed his view. Boucher and Barggren, citing many 
instances of alleged harassment, have obtained Superior Court restraining 
orders against each other. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a nice neighborhood, and (the fence) looks like a big barricade," 
said Boucher, a retired pediatrician. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, after city officials ordered her to remove or alter the fence to meet 
the height limit, Barggren asked city planners for a formal variance. The 
request was denied, and she appealed to the city's Planning Commission, which 
also turned her down. 
</P>
<P>
 In a report, Zoning Administrator Dennis Eschen noted that Barggren's home had 
been burglarized but said he found "nothing in the physical situation that 
creates any greater exposure for the site than any other property, or any other 
corner lot." 
</P>
<P>
 Barggren said she has continued to fight to keep her fence because she 
believes the city singled her out for prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have always thought that America was equal for everybody," she said. "But 
they're determined to treat me differently." 
</P>
<P>
 At the start of the Municipal Court trial last month, Judge Bradford L. 
Andrews denied a motion by Barggren's attorney to dismiss the case because of 
selective prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
 City Prosecutor John Vander Lans, who handled the case in the recent trial, 
denied that Barggren was unfairly targeted. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, there are many other fences not in compliance," he said. "Just as there 
are many people who speed. Some get pulled over and some don't. 
</P>
<P>
 Vander Lans said Barggren was treated the same as anyone who has been accused 
of violating a city ordinance. The difference, he said, is that Barggren 
refuses to comply.  
</P>
<P>
 "We've done everything we can to get her into compliance, but at some point 
the city has to say enough is enough," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The reason we have so few fence violations is that if we can settle the 
thing, that ends it," Vander Lans added. "But she refuses to do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the jury's ruling, Barggren said she has no plans to remove or change 
her fence. She said she may take her case to federal court, charging that Long 
Beach officials have violated her civil rights to secure her property. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there's still justice in the system, or I'll prove there isn't 
justice in the system," she said.

NME TO BUY RIVAL CHAIN AMERICAN MEDICAL; ACQUISITIONS: $3.3-BILLION DEAL AIMS 
TO SPUR FIRM'S COMPETITIVENESS IN CALIFORNIA, OUT OF STATE. ANALYSTS' REACTIONS 
ARE MIXED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID R. OLMOS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 National Medical Enterprises said Tuesday that it will acquire rival hospital 
chain American Medical Holdings in a $3.3-billion deal that would nearly double 
its size and strengthen its presence in the key Southern California and 
southern Florida markets. 
</P>
<P>
 With the hospital industry undergoing a massive restructuring, National 
Medical's acquisition would ensure that the Santa Monica company -- now the 
nation's second-largest health care firm -- remains a significant player, 
analysts and company executives said. 
</P>
<P>
 It would also increase the likelihood that National Medical, which was likely 
to be swallowed by a competitor if it didn't strike first, can remain 
independent. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the deal is not quite the blockbuster that National Medical Chairman 
Jeffrey Barbakow had set his sights on. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbakow tried to negotiate a complicated three-way merger with Dallas-based 
American Medical and HealthTrust Inc. of Nashville. If completed, it would have 
transformed National Medical into a health care giant nearly equal in size to 
Columbia/HCA Healthcare Corp., the nation's largest health care concern. 
</P>
<P>
 But Columbia/HCA, based in Louisville, Ky., quashed Barbakow's plan a week ago 
when it bid $3.4 billion for HealthTrust. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of becoming a national force almost overnight, National Medical will 
have to settle for becoming a bigger player in specific U.S. markets. Besides 
California and Florida, the American Medical deal would also give the firm a 
strong presence in New Orleans and Texas. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will never be the biggest health care company in the United States; that 
is not our goal," Barbakow said. "We will try to improve our position in the 
markets we serve." 
</P>
<P>
 The new company would have $5.3 billion in combined revenue and 84 hospitals 
in 13 states and overseas. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbakow called the American Medical deal "the very best transaction" 
available to the company and said more acquisitions are likely. 
</P>
<P>
 "You'll see a lot of deals quickly," he said, adding that they will probably 
include acquisitions of one or two hospitals in certain markets. He said the 
company will look closely at possible acquisition of nonprofit hospitals, many 
of which are struggling financially in an era of medical cost cutting. 
</P>
<P>
 But Barbakow said the company is also exploring some larger hospital 
acquisitions, though most of the biggest chains have been snatched up in other 
mergers. One exception is Nashville-based OrNda Healthcorp., a 48-hospital 
chain with a strong presence in California, which some analysts have suggested 
as a good match for National Medical. Barbakow wouldn't comment on any 
discussions with OrNda. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts had mixed reactions to the deal. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Villwock of Johnson Rice & Co. in New Orleans praised the deal as "a 
tremendous operating merger" with "a lot of synergies." 
</P>
<P>
 But Dean Witter Reynolds' Todd Richter said National Medical's move was "one 
of desperation. Putting NME and American Medical together doesn't get you the 
critical mass you need to survive in the future." 
</P>
<P>
 Barbakow said the merger would allow the company to negotiate better deals 
with health insurers because of the size and breadth of its facilities in 
Southern California. It would create especially strong operations in Southern 
California -- which would account for half the combined entity's revenue -- and 
in southern Florida, Louisiana and Texas. 
</P>
<P>
 National Medical owns eight hospitals in Southern California, including its 
Los Angeles flagships, Century City Hospital and USC University Hospital. 
American Medical operates five hospitals in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a hospital in Century City and now we have ones in Tarzana and 
Encino, plus Orange County," Barbakow said. "We'll have the critical mass to go 
to the employers in Los Angeles and say, 'We have the following assets and 
services across Southern California.' " 
</P>
<P>
 But one health care executive said National Medical may still not have enough 
facilities in the huge Los Angeles market to gain the marketplace clout it 
seeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't seen any HMOs that are willing to sign a contract with one medical 
system," said Terry Hartshorn, chief executive of UniHealth America, a 
Burbank-based health care company that owns nine hospitals in Southern 
California. "This marketplace is so complex and competitive now that 15 
hospitals isn't a big enough critical mass to create much of anything." 
</P>
<P>
 The $3.3-billion valuation for American Medical includes the assumption of 
about $1.3 billion in debt by National Medical. 
</P>
<P>
 National Medical shares fell 62.5 cents to $15.625 on Tuesday in heavy New 
York Stock Exchange trading. American Medical shares rose $1.625 to $24. 
Barbakow said no decision has been made on where to locate the corporate 
offices if the deal is completed. National Medical has been looking for a new 
headquarters for several months. Its Santa Monica offices were badly damaged in 
the Northridge earthquake in January, and it doesn't need as much office space 
after recent layoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 The new company will be renamed, "but all I can tell you is it will not have 
NME in it," Barbakow said in a telephone conversation. 
</P>
<P>
 Renaming the company, observers said, would be a good strategy because the 
National Medical name has become linked to fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Barbakow took the top job at National Medical 15 months ago, the company 
has struggled to overcome its negative image after a swamp of legal and ethical 
problems. In July, the company paid $380 million to settle federal criminal 
fraud charges and pleaded guilty to six counts of paying kickbacks for the 
referral of Medicare patients. It also paid more than $200 million to settle 
civil suits brought by insurers and former patients over allegations of fraud, 
overbilling and patient abuse, primarily involving the company's psychiatric 
hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
 National Medical has divested most of those facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Until 1990, American Medical was based in Beverly Hills. Its chairman and 
chief executive, Robert W. O'Leary, is former head of the St. Joseph Health 
System, a not-for-profit, nine-hospital chain based in Orange. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Leary and John T. Casey, American Medical's president and chief operating 
officer, would become co-vice chairmen on National Medical's board. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbakow would be chairman and chief executive of the combined companies, and 
Michael Focht, National Medical's president and chief operating officer, would 
retain those titles. National Medical Merger 
</P>
<P>
 The combination of National Medical Enterprises and American Medical 
International would double NME's revenue and more than double its number of 
hospitals to 84, but the new firm would still be far behind the giant 
Columbia/HCA Healthcare Corp., which would have 311 hospitals under a pending 
merger. Here's what the combined company would look like: 
</P>
<P>
 * Revenue: $5.28 billion 
</P>
<P>
 * General hospitals: 84 
</P>
<P>
 * Geographic concentration: California, Texas, Florida 
</P>
<P>
 * Employees: 63,200 
</P>
<P>
 * Headquarters: Santa Monica 
</P>
<P>
 * Chief executive: Jeffrey Barbakow

DOW CLIMBS 55.51 ON PROFIT REPORTS AND RALLY IN BONDS; MARKETS: THE ADVANCE, 
LED BY TECHNOLOGY AND INDUSTRIAL ISSUES, CARRIES MANY STOCKS HIGHER. BUT SOME 
DOUBT ITS STAYING POWER.

 Stocks surged in a broad rally Tuesday, helped by strong corporate earnings 
reports and a sudden drop in bond yields and gold prices. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow Jones industrial average jumped 55.51 points, or 1.5%, to 3,876.83 in 
heavy Big Board trading of 355 million shares. It was the Dow's third straight 
gain.  
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said the market's advance was impressive, but they also warned that 
it may constitute little more than a natural "snap back" from the deep selloff 
of recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "The odds favor us going up some more but then giving it back," said Gregory 
Nie, analyst at Kemper Securities in Chicago. He noted that many investors 
remain skittish about the outlook for interest rates and inflation as the 
economy continues to grow. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, some investors seemed cheered by healthy third-quarter earnings 
reports from a variety of blue-chip companies, including semiconductor maker 
Motorola, Big Three auto maker Chrysler and soft drink giant PepsiCo. Bullish 
Wall Streeters have been counting on strong earnings to give investors a reason 
to continue to buy stocks, even though interest rates have risen sharply this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 "The focus has shifted from worries about inflation and interest rates to the 
economy and earnings," said Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer at brokerage 
First Albany Corp. "Companies are beginning to see the payoffs of the past few 
years of restructuring and a stronger-than-expected recovery in Europe." 
</P>
<P>
 Some experts, noting that the Dow had jumped 23.89 points Monday and nearly 
doubled that gain Tuesday, said investor sentiment may have turned in the wake 
of last Friday's September employment report. That report showed job creation 
continues at an impressive pace but isn't so strong as to suggest an 
overheating economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, a report in the New York Times on Tuesday indicated that many Federal 
Reserve Board governors are willing to wait for more economic data before 
deciding whether to tighten credit for a sixth time this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fed story helped spark a powerful rally in the bond market, which was 
closed Monday for the Columbus Day holiday. The yield on the 30-year Treasury 
bond, which closed at 7.90% on Friday, sank as low as 7.83% early Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Falling gold prices also stoked bonds by hinting at easing inflation worries. 
Near-term gold futures contracts on the Comex slid $3.10 to $387.60 an ounce. 
</P>
<P>
 But later in the day, the bond rally fizzled after retailing tracker 
Johnson-Redbook Service said U.S. retailers' sales in the week ended Oct. 8 
were up nearly 10% from a year ago. That suggested new strength in the economy. 
</P>
<P>
 By the close, the 30-year T-bond yield was at 7.86%. 
</P>
<P>
 The stock market, meanwhile, didn't exhibit the breadth of buying that some 
analysts said would be expected with the Dow up 55 points and with Mideast 
tensions apparently easing. Winners topped losers 15 to 7 on the NYSE and by 
just 15 to 12 on the Nasdaq market. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the upper-3,800 region (on the Dow) is going to be tougher to get 
through" than on previous rally attempts this year, said Kemper's Nie, noting 
that the market suffered a number of serious "technical" breakdowns in the 
selloff of recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Tuesday's highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Blue-chip issues rising on earnings reports included Chrysler, up 5/8 to 46 
1/2; PepsiCo, up 2 1/4 to 34 3/4; Procter & Gamble, up 2 1/2 to 62 3/8, and 
Gannett, up 5/8 to 47 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Many industrial issues rebounded sharply. Ford and GM performed better than 
Chrysler's shares, up 1 1/8 to 29 3/8 and 1 5/8 to 47 1/8, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere, GE rose 1 1/2 to 48 3/8, Caterpillar gained 2 3/8 to 55 3/8, Deere 
jumped 2 1/4 to 70 3/4, Owens-Corning leaped 1 3/4 to 31 5/8 and TRW shot up 2 
3/8 to 74. 
</P>
<P>
 * Technology stocks were hot. Motorola surged 1 3/8 to 54 1/8 on its earnings 
news. Other winners included Sun Microsystems, up 1 3/4 to 30 3/4; Autodesk, up 
1 3/8 to 68 1/4; Xerox, up 2 to 109 1/4, and Powersoft, up 3 5/8 to 58 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Among classic growth issues, Coca-Cola rocketed 1 3/8 to 50 3/8, Mattel 
gained 1 3/8 to 27 3/4 and Anheuser-Busch rose 1 3/8 to 52 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
 In overseas trading, some markets' gains helped prime Wall Street. Frankfurt's 
30-share DAX index shot up 46.27 points to 2,071.06 on continued optimism about 
this week's national elections. 
</P>
<P>
 In London, the FTSE 100 index rose 40.7 points to 3,073.0, while Tokyo's 
Nikkei 225 index added 76.71 points to 19,821.46. 
</P>
<P>
 In Mexico City, the Bolsa index leaped 43.96 points to 2,665.59. 
</P>
<P>
 In currency trading, the dollar -- viewed as a safe-haven currency in times of 
military conflicts -- ended mixed as Persian Gulf tensions receded. In New 
York, the dollar closed at 1.546 German marks, up from 1.545 on Monday and at 
100.25 Japanese yen, down from 100.35.

JAMES FLANIGAN: DESPITE SOLID POTENTIAL, HUSSEIN STEERS IRAQ ON PATH OF 
ECONOMIC RUIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Saddam Hussein is shooting the Iraqi economy in the foot again. But the United 
States will feel the pain. And so, ultimately, this confrontation could force a 
shift in U.S. policy. 
</P>
<P>
 By threatening Kuwait with troops, even though he appears to have backed off 
in the face of a swift U.S. response, the Baghdad dictator has made another 
disastrous move that will keep Iraq's oil exports bottled up and its economy 
hobbled by United Nations sanctions for another year or more. 
</P>
<P>
 The continued absence from world markets of Iraq's production will keep oil 
prices roughly $3 a barrel higher than they would otherwise be, which could be 
good news for Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Mexico, Venezuela and other oil producers 
that are close U.S. allies. 
</P>
<P>
 But it's not good news for the United States, which will incur greater risk 
and expense because of a poor and desperate Iraq -- in terms of troops 
stationed in Kuwait and other measures in an unstable Middle East -- than if 
the country were able to realize its vast potential. 
</P>
<P>
 Some experts say Saddam is using threat and disruption to get Washington's 
attention and negotiations, as North Korea, Cuba and Haiti have done. Indeed, 
this latest confrontation may force a U.S. reassessment of policies toward 
Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
 That's because the problem may not be short-term. Iraq was a bellicose nation 
long before Saddam Hussein took power in 1971, and it could continue to 
threaten its neighbors after he's gone if it remains poor and resentful. 
</P>
<P>
 Restoring Iraq to a world of growing economies and peaceful pursuits is in the 
U.S. interest -- but it will be no easy matter. 
</P>
<P>
 Iraq, with 18 million people, as much as 150 billion barrels of oil -- the 
world's second-largest reserves -- and historically abundant agriculture and an 
educated population, blames U.N. sanctions for its plight today. Its economic 
output per person, a measure of living standards, has declined to roughly 
$1,600 annually -- comparable to Iran next door -- from the lofty levels (for 
the Middle East) of $3,650 per person in 1990, before the Gulf War. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, sanctions have hurt. Before the war, Iraq exported $18 billion a year in 
oil and other products. It now exports $1 billion a year, including $400 
million of oil shipments through Jordan and Turkey that the United States winks 
at. Loss of export revenues has curtailed the economy and lack of imports has 
set off inflationary demands for simple consumer items.  
</P>
<P>
 But Iraq has also spurned offers from the United Nations to allow $1.6 billion 
in oil exports to pay for food and medicines and spurned U.S. offers to 
unfreeze some Iraqi bank deposits. An angry nationalism got in the way of good 
sense, as it has for decades, says Patrick Clawson, an economist with the U.S. 
government's National Defense University. 
</P>
<P>
 Saddam Hussein's record is particularly sorry. He turned Iraq, a food exporter 
for 3,000 years and site of the biblical Garden of Eden, into a food importer, 
notes Clawson. 
</P>
<P>
 He depleted Iraq's treasury with an eight-year war against Iran, then tried to 
grab Kuwait in 1990 and got flattened. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, the Iraqi economy improved in 1991 and '92 as rebuilding in Baghdad 
and other cities boosted productivity. Seeing the economy's underlying 
strength, French and Russian business people have been arranging ventures in 
Iraq pending the lifting of sanctions and resumption of oil exports. 
</P>
<P>
 "Iraq could come back very fast if sanctions were lifted -- 1 million barrels 
a day immediately, rising quickly to nearly 3 million," says Albert Anton, a 
partner in Carl H. Pforzheimer & Co., a U.S. investment firm specializing in 
petroleum issues. That would mean a quick $15 billion in additional revenues to 
the country, with more to come as it became a major oil power. 
</P>
<P>
 But the military threat to Kuwait has undermined growing sentiment for easing 
sanctions. Why did Saddam Hussein do it? Yet another miscalculation, say many 
experts. But Zalmay Khalilzad, a former Defense Department official who is now 
director of Middle East Studies at Rand Corp., says that "maybe he saw that 
confrontation gets results, that troublemakers like North Korea and Haiti get 
negotiations with Washington." 
</P>
<P>
 For sure Washington will have to do something different. Hoping for an Iraqi 
uprising against Saddam Hussein is unrealistic, say most experts. "He has a 
praetorian guard around him in Baghdad," says one. 
</P>
<P>
 Iraq's economy is hurting, but reports of starvation may be propaganda. 
"Agriculture is actually doing better," says Clawson. 
</P>
<P>
 So, after U.S. troops are in place in Kuwait and the cost of keeping them 
there is mounting, the United States and other countries may turn to devising a 
new deal for Iraq. Joseph Tovey of Tovey & Co., a U.S. oil investment firm with 
interests in the Middle East, theorizes that a confederation of states could be 
set up for the many ethnic and religious populations in Iraq. The country is 
already divided, with U.S. and U.N. troops protecting a Kurdish state in the 
north and now contemplating creation of a buffer state in the south. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, with vast oil reserves and the Garden of Eden at stake, working out 
Iraq's future will be a long process. But the payoff for the Middle East of a 
progressive, peaceful Iraq would be tremendous. 
</P>
<P>
 It will be a vast opportunity for U.S. and world business, of course. But 
also, like the Babylon it was in ancient history, Iraq should be a source of 
reflection. Here is a land with the potential to be one of the wealthiest and 
most progressive on Earth. Yet decades of misrule have made it a place of 
misery and desperation -- and a threat to its neighbors and the U.S. military. 
Indeed, like Haiti and North Korea, Iraq is a wake-up call: It says peace is a 
full-time job and we have work to do in the world.

CHRYSLER CHALKS UP ITS BEST 3RD QUARTER AS PROFIT SOARS 54%; AUTOS: THE UPBEAT 
REPORT IS DELIVERED AS PRESIDENT CLINTON VISITS BIG THREE COUNTRY, TOUTING THE 
INDUSTRY'S TURNAROUND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 With President Clinton taking credit for the nation's economic revival in a 
visit to southeast Michigan on Tuesday, a Big Three auto maker provided solid 
proof of good times in the heartland. 
</P>
<P>
 Chrysler Corp. reported earnings of $650 million in the three months ended 
Sept. 30, compared to the $423 million it earned in the third quarter of last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 The nation's No. 3 auto maker said the 54% jump in earnings -- a record profit 
for the normally slow third quarter -- reflects continuing strong sales of 
minivans, small trucks and cars, as well as lower incentives offered to 
consumers. Sales increased 21% in the quarter to $11.7 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 "The results were excellent," said Maryann Keller, an analyst with Furman 
Selz, a New York brokerage. "It's a story of a company managing its costs well 
and being the beneficiary of a robust truck market." 
</P>
<P>
 In the first nine months of 1994, Chrysler generated sales of $38 billion and 
earned $2.55 billion -- more money than it has made during any single year in 
the past decade. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the strong performance, Chrysler's stock moved up just 62.5 cents to 
$46.50 on Tuesday on the New York Stock Exchange. The stocks of Ford Motor Co. 
and General Motors Corp., which also expect to report strong profits later this 
month, also moved up. Ford gained $1.125 to $29.375, and GM leaped $1.625 to 
$47.125. The earnings report came on a day Clinton visited the Detroit area to 
campaign for Rep. Bob Carr (D-Mich.), who is in a tight Senate race with 
Republican Spencer Abraham. 
</P>
<P>
 In a speech to several thousand auto workers at Ford's Mustang assembly plant 
in Dearborn, the President said his policies had revived an economy "stuck in 
reverse." He later met with Big Three executives and UAW members, praising both 
for the industry's turnaround. 
</P>
<P>
 Auto sales have been one of the brightest spots of the economy. For the first 
nine months of the year, car and truck sales are up 9% over last year, and most 
analysts predict the boom will continue through 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 In the third quarter, Chrysler's sales increased 15% from a year ago. Demand 
was particularly strong for its minivans, Jeep Grand Cherokee, Dodge Ram pickup 
and Neon subcompact. 
</P>
<P>
 The brisk sales allowed the company to improve its profit margins by dropping 
consumer incentives. The average discount given buyers was $520 in the quarter, 
down from $775 a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "Strong retail demand . . . allowed us to reduce incentives despite increased 
competition," Chrysler Chairman Robert Eaton said. 
</P>
<P>
 The company's production is expected to increase substantially in the fourth 
quarter. And analysts expect its sales to continue to increase. 
</P>
<P>
 "They should do even better next year," said David Cole, director of the 
Office for the Study of Automotive Transportation at the University of 
Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
 Chrysler, which was in deep financial trouble just five years ago, is using 
the soaring profits to improve its balance sheet. 
</P>
<P>
 The company contributed $600 million in the quarter to its unfunded pension 
liability, bringing to $1.8 billion the amount it has set aside this year. 
Company officials said the unfunded liability -- which stood at $2.2 billion at 
the end of last year -- should be eliminated by Dec. 30.

 Delta to Stay at LAX Site: The carrier said it reached an agreement with Los 
Angeles International Airport officials that will keep more than 900 workers, 
mainly reservations and customer service agents, at Delta Air Lines' city-owned 
facility on Century Boulevard. Delta, which is undergoing a massive 
cost-cutting effort, had said it was considering leaving unless it could strike 
an acceptable rent deal.The agreement calls for Delta's lease to remain in 
force until early 1998, but the annual rent -- estimated at $600,000 -- will in 
effect be cut because both sides will look for other parties to sublease space 
on the site. A Delta spokesman said the carrier is "very pleased to be able to 
keep the jobs where they are."

 Continental Sells Casualty Insurance Unit: The leading property-casualty 
insurer said it agreed to sell the group to Santa Monica-based Freemont General 
Corp. for $250 million.The unit is the leading writer of workers' compensation 
insurance in Illinois. Continental Corp. also has offices in Wisconsin, 
Indiana, Michigan and California. The Chicago company said earlier this year 
that it would sell its workers' comp group as part of a program to raise 
capital. Continental lost $84 million during the first six months of the year, 
due mostly to losses incurred from the Northridge earthquake and last winter's 
storms. It recently suspended its dividend payments and said it would lay off 
2,000 employees.

<P>
 The severance plan, implemented Sept. 15, calls for each of Magma's six top 
executives to be paid double their salary and bonuses if Magma is taken over 
and they are terminated, Magma said Tuesday in a filing with the Securities and 
Exchange Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 Four days later -- on Sept. 19 -- California Energy Co. offered $35 for each 
of Magma's 24 million shares outstanding. The offer consisted of $25 cash and 
$10 of California Energy common stock. 
</P>
<P>
 Jon Peele, Magma's general counsel, said the timing was a coincidence. "It 
looks like there's a connection, but there's not," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Peele said Magma's board actually approved the plan in November, 1993, but 
took almost a year to implement it. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're a small company and don't have a large staff to do this sort of thing," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Magma's board has recommended unanimously that its shareholders reject a 
hostile tender offer commenced last week by California Energy for 51% of 
Magma's outstanding shares at $35 a share in cash. That offer is valued at $434 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 California Energy has said it plans to launch a proxy fight to replace Magma's 
board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
 California Energy will seek a meeting of Magma shareholders in 30 days, said 
David Sokol, California Energy's chairman. 
</P>
<P>
 Magma is a geothermal energy company based in San Diego. California Energy, 
based in Omaha, is also a geothermal energy company and builds electric power 
plants. 
</P>
<P>
 Magma's severance plan would cover Magma Chairman Paul Pankratz and President 
and CEO Ralph Boeker as well as the company's general counsel, senior vice 
president of commercial operations, vice president of North American operations 
and chief financial officer. 
</P>
<P>
 In the SEC filing, Magma said its board also implemented a less generous 
severance for nine other Magma officers. They would receive a cash payment 
equal to their salary and bonuses if terminated after a takeover.

INTEL SEEKS TO BLOCK SHIPMENT OF CLONE CHIPS BY RIVAL AMD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Bloomberg Business News 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Intel Corp. said it will ask a judge to block rival Advanced Micro Devices 
Inc. from shipping clones of 486 microprocessors containing an obscure software 
code. 
</P>
<P>
 Intel, the world's largest maker of microprocessors, or chips, also plans to 
seek compensation from AMD for the millions of AMD 486 chips already sold, said 
Jim Jarrett, a spokesman for Santa Clara-based Intel. 
</P>
<P>
 The announcements follow U.S. District Judge Patricia Trumbull's ruling that 
AMD, the fifth-largest maker of computer chips, violated copyright laws by 
including a proprietary Intel code in the chips. 
</P>
<P>
 The 486 is currently the most popular type of microprocessor, controlling the 
logic functions in about 30 million personal computers in use. 
</P>
<P>
 AMD has sold more than 4 million of the chips, but claims only about 100,000 
of them are affected by the ruling. Those chips will be altered or destroyed 
with no material effect on company earnings, said Jerry Sanders, AMD's chairman 
and chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our main concern is being sure that we can continue our product supply to our 
customer base, and we're confident we can do that," said Sanders, who claimed 
Intel wants to shut AMD out of the lucrative 486 market. 
</P>
<P>
 AMD shares closed down 62.5 cents at $24.625 on the New York Stock Exchange. 
Intel, which traded on the Nasdaq, closed up 6.25 cents at $60.50. 
</P>
<P>
 The ruling, the latest in a decade of legal battles between the one-time 
allies, came in a lawsuit filed four years ago over so-called in-circuit 
emulation, or ICE, code that is contained in software embedded on the chip. 
</P>
<P>
 The code is used typically by chip designers, but was used by AMD to help 
manage power in about 100,000 chips. Sanders noted most computer users don't 
even know the code is there, and couldn't access it if they did know about it.

TWA TO PRESS FOR RESTRUCTURING OF ITS $1.8-BILLION DEBT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Trans World Airlines Inc. said Tuesday that it will seek approval from 
creditors for a massive restructuring of its debt that would increase ownership 
of the company by its creditors. 
</P>
<P>
 The carrier has filed for Securities and Exchange Commission permission to cut 
its current $1.8 billion in debt by $800 million by exchanging equity for debt. 
If creditors fail to approve the plan, TWA said, it will file a prepackaged 
bankruptcy plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said the restructuring calls for shifting creditor ownership of the 
company to about 70% from the current 55% by issuing stock to the creditors and 
postponing lease payments for six months. 
</P>
<P>
 "The proposed exchange of new equity for debt is part of new management's 
strategic business plan to restructure the airline operationally and 
financially," the company said. 
</P>
<P>
 In exchange for a six-month moratorium on lease payments for flight equipment 
and aircraft, the company offered to issue shares of common stock and equity 
rights to the lessors in exchange for cancellation of 50% of the rental 
payments over the period and a payment plan for the other 50%. 
</P>
<P>
 The out-of-court financial restructuring plan hinges on approval of all of its 
aspects, TWA said. 
</P>
<P>
 TWA, based in St. Louis, ended a 21-month bankruptcy restructuring last 
November. Creditors got a 55% stake in the airline in exchange for forgiving $1 
billion in debt. Employees took the remaining 45% stake. Under the new plan, 
that share would shrink to as low as 30%. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeffrey Erickson, TWA's chief executive, also said Tuesday that the airline 
expects to cut its costs to about 7.5 cents per available seat mile by this 
winter, from 9 cents. 
</P>
<P>
 Many carriers have sought to achieve the 7.5-cent figure, but only Southwest 
Airlines has succeeded. Erickson said operating-cost reductions the company 
initiated over the past few months will produce annual savings of $250 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of those savings include agreements reached recently with its three major 
labor unions that would save $130 million a year.

GOVERNMENTS TO BENEFIT IN AIRLINE ACCORD; TRANSPORTATION: SETTLEMENT GRANTING 
DISCOUNT FARES STEMS FROM CLASS-ACTION LAWSUIT OVER ALLEGED PRICE FIXING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Major airlines agreed to pay $40 million in discounts to state and local 
governments to settle a third price-fixing lawsuit, a group of 10 state 
attorneys general said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The airlines settled a separate class-action suit last year brought by 
passengers by agreeing to pay out $458 million in discounts. The airlines 
earlier this year resolved a federal antitrust suit by agreeing not to announce 
price changes in advance. 
</P>
<P>
 State and local government agencies, which were not covered by the passenger 
class-action suit, are to get 10% discounts on flights for 18 months or until 
the $40-million limit is reached. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest suit was brought by attorneys general from Colorado, Connecticut, 
Florida, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Utah and 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 The settlement is subject to approval by a federal judge and applies to all 50 
states, territories and their municipalities. Alaska, American, Continental, 
Delta, Northwest, TWA, United and USAir took part in the settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 The government discounts would be available directly through computerized 
reservations systems. Governments wouldn't be required to file the claim forms 
required by millions of passengers who sought compensation from the 
class-action suit. 
</P>
<P>
 Passengers in the class-action suit could start getting discount coupons in 
December if the process goes as scheduled. Lawyers have separated the eligible 
passengers from those who aren't entitled to coupons and plan to ask a federal 
judge to approve their decisions late this week or early next week, passenger 
attorney Ann Yahner said. 
</P>
<P>
 The price-fixing claims centered on an airline practice of announcing price 
changes in advance through the reservations systems. If competitors didn't go 
along with the price change, it could be rescinded before it was to take 
effect. 
</P>
<P>
 The airlines agreed to settle the federal suit by agreeing to impose any price 
increases immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 That Justice Department settlement was supposed to make it riskier for an 
airline to raise prices. If an airline hikes fares and others don't go along, 
the higher-priced airline could lose bookings.

 T-Bill Rates Mixed: The Treasury Department sold $13 billion of new 
three-month bills at an average discount rate of 4.92%, the same as last 
week.Another $13.1 billion of new six-month bills were sold at an average 
discount rate of 5.34%, down from 5.38% last week. The six-month bill rate was 
the lowest since it averaged 5.22% on Sept. 26. 
</P>
<P>
 The new discount rates understate the actual return to investors: 5.05% for 
three-month bills, with a $10,000 bill selling for $9,875.60, and 5.57% for a 
six-month bill selling for $9,730.00. The discount rate reflects the price 
discount received when government securities are purchased at less than face 
value.

MARKET BEAT / TOM PETRUNO: NEARLY FORGOTTEN, DIVIDENDS ARE COMING BACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM PETRUNO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Corporate America is getting more generous with cash dividends, and just in 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 With the stock market churning and making no progress in 1994, capital gains 
are but a memory for most investors. That leaves dividend income as stock 
owners' only hope for some kind of return. 
</P>
<P>
 The good news is that there were 1,333 dividend increases by American 
companies between Jan. 1 and Sept. 30, the most for that period since 1981, 
according to Standard & Poor's Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet corporate managers arguably have a lot of catching up to do in sharing the 
wealth with stockholders: The average dividend yield on the blue-chip S&P 500 
stocks is a mere 2.9%, near its historical low and far below the yields on 
competing investments. Even boring six-month U.S. Treasury bills yield 5.5% 
today. 
</P>
<P>
 Stocks' generally low yields aren't a new phenomenon, of course. As interest 
rates have declined over the past 13 years, stock prices have rocketed. That's 
been a natural yield-depressant. And when corporate earnings stalled with the 
1990-'91 recession, so did dividend increases. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the typical stock yield has been so low for so long that some Wall 
Streeters question whether dividends matter much anymore. Rather than pay cash 
to shareholders -- a fully taxable event -- many firms now resort to share 
buybacks to boost their stocks and thus generate bigger capital gains for 
investors, taxable at lower rates. 
</P>
<P>
 Some market pros, however, argue that the importance of dividends has merely 
been obscured over the past decade by stocks' oversized price gains. If it gets 
ever more difficult to pick winning stocks in the 1990s -- and that has 
certainly been true since '92 -- dividend income will be very meaningful again, 
these pros contend. 
</P>
<P>
 One dividend proponent is John Fields, manager of the Philadelphia-based 
Delaware Group's Decatur Total Return and Decatur Income stock funds. He notes 
that the S&P 500 index's average annual gain from price appreciation in the 
wild 1980s was 12.6%, the best showing since the 1950s. Dividends added another 
4.4% a year to that '80s return, but who cared at that point? 
</P>
<P>
 Now look at S&P returns in the 1990-1993 period, Fields says. The annualized 
capital gain dropped to 7.2%, while dividends added 3.5% a year -- providing 
one-third of stocks' "total" return in the period. And measured from 1926 
through 1993, dividends' importance to the S&P's total return is even greater: 
You earned 10.3% a year, of which fully 4.9% was from dividends. 
</P>
<P>
 Fields' point is that, if stock market returns are coming back into line with 
historical averages, dividend income could mean the difference between relative 
success and failure in investing. His kind of mature, high-dividend stocks -- 
Exxon, W. R. Grace, J. C. Penney, GE, among many others -- make sense as "core" 
holdings, offering greater stability than pure "growth" stocks in dicey 
markets, plus some inflation protection in the form of rising dividends, Fields 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 Put another way, a dividend is a cushion, and cushions may have more value in 
difficult markets. 
</P>
<P>
 The Decatur Total Return fund currently yields about 3% from dividends, while 
the Decatur Income fund yields about 4% (the latter fund includes some bonds, 
to boost the yield). Some of Fields' competitor funds yield even more. Lindner 
Dividend fund's yield, for example, tops 7%; the Evergreen Total Return fund 
yields 5.9%. 
</P>
<P>
 But you have to be careful about what you're buying in a fund that emphasizes 
dividends. Funds heavily invested in electric utilities, for example, have been 
slammed this year as that industry's outlook has soured. And very-high-yielding 
stocks often are in danger of dividend cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, while dividends obviously have been important in historical stock 
returns, San Diego-based pension consultant Michael Stolper notes that the best 
stock funds to own are those managed by good stock-pickers, period. Dividend 
income, after all, is limited. Capital gains aren't. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider: Over the past 30 years, the average "equity-income" fund (the 
category in which most dividend funds fall) has gained an impressive 2,041%, 
according to Lipper Analytical. The average "growth" fund did far better, up 
2,723%. The question, as always, is how much risk you're willing to accept on 
the way to potentially higher returns. Dividends may let you sleep better. 
Better Dividends 
</P>
<P>
 After three years of paltry increases, total dividends paid by the Standard & 
Poor's 500-index companies are expected to rise nearly 3% this year from 1993, 
as managements share more earnings with stockholders. 
</P>
<P>
 S&P 500 dividend increases (in %) 
</P>
<P>
 1994*: +2.7%

UNION PACIFIC MAY HIKE BID FOR SANTA FE; RAILROADS: THE COMPANY WANTS A LOOK AT 
SANTA FE'S BOOKS. ONE ANALYST CALLS THE MOVE 'GAMESMANSHIP.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Union Pacific Corp. said Tuesday that it might boost its $3.25-billion bid for 
Santa Fe Pacific Corp. if it is allowed a look at Santa Fe's books. 
</P>
<P>
 The request came in a letter from Union Pacific Chairman Drew Lewis to Santa 
Fe Chairman Robert D. Krebs and Santa Fe's directors. 
</P>
<P>
 In response, Krebs issued a statement late Tuesday saying Lewis' letter had 
been reviewed by the Santa Fe board, "adds nothing" to previous correspondence 
and, barring new information, Santa Fe's "position still stands." 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, Santa Fe rejected Union Pacific's bid and said it would stick with 
a $2.5-billion bid from Burlington Northern Inc. it accepted in late June. 
</P>
<P>
 Union Pacific, the nation's largest railroad in terms of revenue, offered no 
new answers to Santa Fe's objections that the Interstate Commerce Commission 
probably would block a merger of the two companies on antitrust grounds. They 
compete on routes between the Midwest and California. 
</P>
<P>
 In his response late Tuesday, Krebs asked Lewis to "provide us promptly with 
Union Pacific's 'analysis of ICC matters,' as referenced in your letter." 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, Union Pacific's move may signal an escalation in the bidding war 
for Santa Fe, the nation's seventh-largest railroad company, based in the 
Chicago suburb of Schaumburg. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Flower, a rail industry analyst with Kidder, Peabody Inc. in New York, 
dismissed Union Pacific's letter as "gamesmanship." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just posturing before anything serious happens," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some analysts believe Union Pacific, based in Bethlehem, Pa., joined the 
bidding to block or slow the Santa Fe-Burlington merger. But Union Pacific 
insists it is serious about buying Santa Fe. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Fe's stock closed up 12.50 cents at $14.625 a share on the New York 
Stock Exchange. Burlington's bid values Santa Fe at $13.20 a share; Union 
Pacific's stock-swap proposal values the company at more than $17.

SUING A CORPORATION IS NO SIMPLE MATTER; COURTS: IT MAY SEEM LIKE MORE 
INDIVIDUALS ARE WINNING CASES, BUT THE REALITY IS MORE COMPLEX. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

From Associated Press

<TEXT>
<P>
 Sometimes it seems like suing a company is guaranteed to make a plaintiff a 
millionaire. 
</P>
<P>
 A secretary is awarded $7.1 million in a sexual harassment lawsuit against the 
Chicago law firm Baker & McKenzie, although she worked at the firm for just 
three months. 
</P>
<P>
 An 81-year-old woman receives a $2.9-million jury award against McDonald's 
after suffering third-degree burns from the fast-food chain's hot coffee. 
</P>
<P>
 Big awards like these grab big headlines. But the public often hears little 
about the aftermath -- a judge cut the award against McDonald's to $480,000, 
and the Baker & McKenzie decision is likely to be appealed. 
</P>
<P>
 The sense from media reports is that the number of individuals suing companies 
and winning is increasing and that jury awards -- especially in the emotionally 
charged areas of employment law and product liability -- are climbing into the 
stratosphere. 
</P>
<P>
 The reality, however, is more complex. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, juries are sending messages to employers that discrimination and 
harassment at work are not acceptable. The number of awards is growing. But 
that's because jury trials and punitive damages in such cases weren't allowed 
before 1991 amendments to the Civil Rights Act. 
</P>
<P>
 "It took time for those cases to make their way through the pipeline," said 
Christine Carty, a litigator with Schnader, Harrison, Segal & Lewis who works 
in employment law. 
</P>
<P>
 In product liability law, despite some large, well-publicized awards, the 
number of suits has actually declined since the mid-1980s and consumers are 
finding juries less sympathetic to their causes, legal experts say. 
</P>
<P>
 Furthermore, one in two awards is either reversed or reduced by juries or 
judges, said Michael Rustad, a professor at Suffolk Law School in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
 State courts, which handle about 100 times the case load of federal courts, 
say that while 18 million new lawsuits are filed each year, less than 2% are 
tort cases -- those involving wrongful acts, injury, negligence or damage. 
</P>
<P>
 In federal court, of the more than 200,000 civil suits filed, only about 6% 
are product liability cases. 
</P>
<P>
 And product liability filings in federal courts, with the exception of 
asbestos cases, declined by about 36% between 1985 and 1991, according to the 
American Bar Assn. All tort filings fell by about 20%, also excluding asbestos 
cases, over the same period. 
</P>
<P>
 But in discrimination and harassment cases, the changes in the Civil Rights 
Act have prompted individuals and lawyers to file more suits, said Ronald 
Green, a partner at Epstein Becker & Green, a firm that represents many 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Anita Hill's accusations against Clarence Thomas during his 1991 
Supreme Court confirmation hearing have helped make the public more aware of 
sexual harassment, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1989, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and local Fair Employment 
Practices Agencies received 5,623 charges of sexual harassment, while 
projections for this year are running at almost 14,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, through the third quarter, the EEOC received 66,000 charges of 
employment discrimination based on race, sex, age, disability, national origin 
and other grounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Few of those charges actually make it to trial, with most being settled before 
lawyers are even contacted and others settled before a trial date is set. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, once a case makes it to court, the stakes are high, Green said. 
Companies are often unwilling to settle in the hopes of discouraging other such 
actions, while plaintiffs who prevail can receive awards running into six 
figures, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although some observers have charged that many cases are often frivolous, with 
employees lured by dollar signs, Green said that is not usually the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyers, whose compensation is often based on whether they succeed, will 
usually bring only the cases they think they can win. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, for plaintiffs, litigation is often lengthy and costly. And it's 
increasingly intrusive -- a plaintiff's sex life can become part of public 
record, a considerable deterrent to frivolous suits. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anyone bringing a harassment or discrimination suit should be prepared for 
possible character assassination," said Philip Kay, a San Francisco lawyer who 
won the California state court jury decision against Baker & McKenzie. 
</P>
<P>
 Filing suit against a company can also do serious damage to a person's future 
chances of employment if the case is lost, Green said. Lawyers for the 
defendant may try to prove a plaintiff is mentally incompetent, for example. 
</P>
<P>
 But juries have a greater understanding than they used to of the issues 
involved, said Gordon Griller, court administrator in Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
 In particular, "women are more aware of their rights than ever before," said 
Denise Hummel, a Boulder, Colo., lawyer who specializes in employment law.

PATIENT, HEAL THYSELF?; PRESCRIPTION DRUG ADS HAVE SOME DOCS WINCING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 From Sports Illustrated to the subway, Americans are being bombarded with ads 
for powerful prescription medicines -- a commercial boom that has drug 
companies smiling but doctors worried. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pretty soon they'll be on milk cartons and hot-air balloons," said Dr. 
William Jacott, whose patients have demanded prescriptions by name even before 
he diagnosed a disease. 
</P>
<P>
 Suffering epileptic seizures? Fighting high cholesterol? Afraid your prostate 
is enlarged? 
</P>
<P>
 The questions jump off the pages of newspapers and magazines. The allergy 
reliever Claritin even advertises in New York subway cars, and hair grower 
Rogaine is all over TV. 
</P>
<P>
 Drug companies say their multimillion-dollar ads make Americans better 
advocates for their health. 
</P>
<P>
 "The decision to prescribe a particular medication is a shared decision 
between doctor and patient," said John Montgomery of Parke Davis, which last 
week advertised its new epilepsy drug, Neurontin, in several major newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
 The ads do advise seeing a doctor -- after all, the drugs are available only 
by prescription. 
</P>
<P>
 But the American Medical Assn. says there's a fine line between educating and 
misleading vulnerable patients. 
</P>
<P>
 "The ones I've seen are clearly quite commercial and don't necessarily give 
the whole story," said Jacott, an AMA trustee and family physician at the 
University of Minnesota. Patients "come in and put the pressure on their 
physicians to prescribe that product." 
</P>
<P>
 Drug companies have always advertised over-the-counter medicines aggressively. 
But until recently, they marketed more powerful prescription drugs only to 
physicians. Salespeople dropped off free samples, and ads full of complicated 
medical data dominated scholarly journals. 
</P>
<P>
 "That era is slowly fading," said Jack Trout, a marketing consultant in 
Greenwich, Conn. "They're beginning to feel the docs . . . don't have time to 
schmooze. So they feel a need to build an equity with the ultimate user." 
</P>
<P>
 Take Proscar, which shrinks enlarged prostates. Every year 4.5 million men 
over age 60 are diagnosed with prostate enlargement, which causes urinary 
problems. Although many never need treatment, they're reluctant to discuss 
symptoms. So Merck is blanketing magazines with ads aimed at men who wonder why 
they "go to the bathroom more than ever now."  
</P>
<P>
 Like other companies, Merck won't say what it spends advertising Proscar, 
which earns more than $100 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
 But a full-page ad in a national magazine can cost $115,000, so campaigns add 
up fast, said advertising expert Patricia Stout of the University of Texas at 
Austin. 
</P>
<P>
 Proscar's success prompted Merck to advertise Mevacor, the world's leading 
cholesterol-lowering drug at $1 billion in sales. The ads target 6.5 million 
Americans who rely on diet and exercise alone to fight high cholesterol, said 
Merck's Gary Bruell. 
</P>
<P>
 Parke Davis followed Merck's lead last week, launching trial Neurontin ads in 
New York, Atlanta, Los Angeles, Chicago and Houston. If sales increase in those 
cities, the ads will spread. 
</P>
<P>
 Neurontin may be an alternative for some of the thousands of epileptics who 
last month abandoned its competitor Felbatol, which can cause liver damage and 
fatal anemia. In fact, Parke Davis hired a publicist to push Neurontin when the 
Felbatol fiasco emerged. 
</P>
<P>
 The Neurontin campaign carefully emphasizes that the drug has only a few, 
minor side effects. But the ads, which went into production before Felbatol's 
problems appeared, don't specifically mention the competitor, Montgomery said. 
</P>
<P>
 The AMA's Jacott said many drug ads, picturing smiling, healthy models, ignore 
side effects and the fact that drugs are appropriate for only certain patients 
-- or they relegate it to medical jargon in the fine print.  
</P>
<P>
 When patients miss the warnings and demand a drug, doctors have to spend a lot 
of time explaining why they disagree, said Dr. Jehan El-Bayoumi of George 
Washington University's medical center. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very positive if people are more involved in their health care," she 
warned, "but there can be a negative consequence to the more commercial 
packaging of drugs."

COMPUTER FILE / LAWRENCE J. MAGID: THE CUTTING EDGE: 
COMPUTING/TECHNOLOGY/INNOVATION; A LONG WAY FROM COLORED PENCILS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LAWRENCE J. MAGID, LAWRENCE J. MAGID is a Silicon Valley-based computer 
writer.

<TEXT>
<P>
 A few years ago, when all we had at home was a black-and-white laser printer, 
I convinced my children that they didn't need color. "Just use your crayons and 
colored pencils," I suggested. I actually got away with it until they graduated 
from preschool. Now that they've spent a few years using the color printers at 
school, they're too sophisticated to fall for my ploy. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not that I was ever against having a color printer. It's just that I run 
a home office and, in the business world, black and white still rules. 
Furthermore, until a few years ago, the only choices for color were a slow, 
poor-quality dot matrix printer or an extremely expensive professional-quality 
thermal printer. 
</P>
<P>
 But all that's beginning to change. Overhead transparencies, report covers and 
even an occasional spreadsheet or word-processing document can make good use of 
color. And thanks to ink-jet technology, color is now affordable. 
</P>
<P>
 OK, I'm convinced: Color is cool. But until very recently, there was still a 
big sacrifice: Low-cost color printers simply couldn't produce the crisp, 
highly readable black-and-white documents I've come to expect from my laser 
printer. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that trade-off is no longer necessary. Both Canon and Hewlett-Packard have 
come out with color ink-jet printers for both PCs and Macs that make few, if 
any, compromises. 
</P>
<P>
 As someone who works mainly in black and white, I'm very impressed by Canon's 
new BJC-4000 Color Bubble Jet Printer (suggested list price of $549). This 
little device takes up only 14.4 inches by 8.1 inches of desk space and, at 
five black-and-white pages per minute, it's faster than most low-cost personal 
laser printers. 
</P>
<P>
 The print quality, in black and white, is virtually indistinguishable from 
that of my laser printer. I've been using the new Canon for about two weeks, 
and so far the only time I've turned on the laser printer is to handle a large 
20-page job. When it comes to the typical one- or two-page letter, the Canon is 
practically as fast as the eight-page-per-minute laser printer. It's also more 
energy-efficient. 
</P>
<P>
 The Canon does an adequate job on color printing as well. I used it to create 
some colorful greeting cards with Broderbund's Print Shop software and have 
made some transparencies using Microsoft Powerpoint. My kids have used it with 
KidPix and other color programs. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hewlett-Packard DeskJet 560C (suggested list price of $599) does a 
slightly better job when it comes to color printing, even though it's a bit 
slower than the Canon. HP's black-and-white printing is nearly as good as 
Canon's, though the Canon seems a bit crisper. These image quality comparisons 
are, admittedly, subjective and unscientific. Canon's main advantage in black 
and white is speed. The first full page of text came out in 30 seconds, 
compared to 50 for the HP. 
</P>
<P>
 If you are planning to use the printer mainly for black and white with 
occasional color, I would go for the Canon. If you plan to switch frequently 
between black and white and color, then the HP has an advantage because you 
don't need to change cartridges. This, plus the fact that the HP appears a bit 
more rugged and has leak-proof cartridges with nontoxic ink, makes it a better 
choice for use by young children. 
</P>
<P>
 If you don't need color, then consider one of the monochrome Canon Bubble Jets 
or the Hewlett-Packard 540, which you can pick up for less than $300. The HP 
540 can be converted to a color printer with an optional $65 color cartridge; 
however, the color cartridge won't give you "true black." It mixes color to 
create a composite black. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, there is still a market for laser printers, especially for people 
who do a lot of printing and have no need for color. I don't see a big 
advantage in a low-cost "personal" laser printer over a high-end ink jet, so 
think twice if you're in the market for a Hewlett-Packard 4L or 4P.  
</P>
<P>
 Whatever you do, look for a laser printer that can handle at least 200 sheets 
of paper and lets you insert envelopes or individual sheets of paper without 
having to remove the main paper cartridge. Most mid- to high-end laser printers 
operate at 600 dots per inch, but 300 dots per inch is good enough for most 
business use.  
</P>
<P>
 Some dealers will try to sell you a more expensive PostScript printer. 
PostScript is fairly standard on the Macintosh and used by both Mac and PC 
desktop publishing professionals. However, there is no need for PostScript for 
most office applications, especially if you're using Windows. Unless you're 
using the printer as a proofing device for professional typesetting, save money 
and get a printer that's Hewlett-Packard-compatible. What to Look for in 
Printers 
</P>
<P>
 Price: Less than $300 for a black-only ink jet, $500 to $600 for a color ink 
jet. Personal laser printers can be had for less than $600, but expect to pay 
$1,200 or more for a mid-range model. 
</P>
<P>
 Speed: Color is slower. A good black-and-white ink jet operates at three to 
five pages per minute. Laser printers start at four pages per minute, but eight 
to 12 is better. 
</P>
<P>
 Compatibility: Hewlett Packard "PCL" compatibility for most personal computer 
business applications. PostScript for professional-level desktop publishing 
use. 
</P>
<P>
 True Black for Ink Jet: Make sure the cartridge contains black ink. Don't 
settle for one that creates a composite black. 
</P>
<P>
 Economy: Look for black printing at about 3 cents a page for ink or laser 
toner. Color should cost 8 and 20 cents, depending on density. 
</P>
<P>
 Energy: EPA "Energy Star" printers use 30 watts or less when idle. Most ink 
jets are even more efficient. This is important if the printer is on all day. 
</P>
<P>
 Support: Look for a one- to three-year warranty and toll-free technical 
support.

DOCUMENT VIEWERS MAKE IT EASIER TO SHOW AND TELL ON THE INTERNET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By MARTY JEROME, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For all the chatter about information superhighways and how communications 
technologies are changing the world, cyberspace today remains a "words only" 
domain. 
</P>
<P>
 You want to send e-mail via Prodigy? No problem. You want to exchange memos on 
the Internet? Fine. But as soon as you try to view pictures or graphics -- 
never mind videos or animation or sound clips -- on a public communications 
network, everything slows to a crawl. To make matters worse, there is little 
agreement on formats for viewing pictures and graphics. Some would argue that 
this won't be solved until that ubiquitous workhorse of on-line communications 
-- the phone line -- is replaced by fiber-optic cable or a two-way cable TV 
hookup. But several emerging technologies offer more immediate hope. 
</P>
<P>
 A class of "portable-document viewer" software, which allows you to view 
documents as they would appear on a printed page, has gained great popularity 
in the past year, and some of the products are beginning to migrate to the 
Internet. 
</P>
<P>
 A small Huntington Beach company called Telegrafix Communications is having 
great success with a program called Ripscrip (for Remote Imaging Protocol 
Script Language), a simple language for transmitting graphics over a variety of 
networks. 
</P>
<P>
 It already enjoys wide support on electronic bulletin boards, which often 
serve as on-ramps to the Internet, and businesses are putting it to work. 
</P>
<P>
 "Realtors can show houses with it," says Wendy Erdtsieck of Telegrafix. 
"Imagine sitting in Connecticut, looking at houses in California. Catalogue 
stores -- home shopping -- are also using it." 
</P>
<P>
 Ripscrip's claim to fame lies in the speed at which it shuttles big graphics 
files, thanks to a crafty and highly efficient compression scheme. But to use 
Ripscrip, both the sender and the receiver must have the software. 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, the portable document viewers permit any document to be converted 
into the format for transmission over networks, and the receiver need only have 
simple viewing software, which is often free. Adobe System's Acrobat Exchange 
is perhaps the best known of these, although No Hands Software's Common Ground 
and Farallon Computing's Replica share most of Acrobat's capabilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the Clinton Administration released its federal budget across the 
Internet using Acrobat. 
</P>
<P>
 Apple Computer is trying to introduce its own standard for portable documents 
in its latest Macintosh system software. 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds of businesses would welcome any standard at this point. Ideally, 
insurance claims adjusters would be able to calculate a damage estimate 
anywhere by browsing through a catalogue of parts located in a central office. 
And doctors could review surgical procedures from medical libraries on a 
different continent.  
</P>
<P>
 The investment house J.P. Morgan, for example, uses Acrobat on its network to 
share analyst reports among executives. Were Acrobat to become the Internet 
standard, for example, it could share those reports electronically -- with 
clients, anywhere in the world -- at enormous cost savings. Because those 
reports contain proprietary, often highly sensitive information, analysts won't 
transmit them to public or corporate fax machines. 
</P>
<P>
 But even Acrobat does not solve the speed problem. That may have to wait until 
cable TV systems -- or a far more advanced type of telephone transmission 
service -- can be used for computer communications. Cable can traffic data 50 
times as fast as a phone line, and 60 million U.S. homes already subscribe.

IN DEVELOPMENT / KATHLEEN WIEGNER: THE CUTTING EDGE: 
COMPUTING/TECHNOLOGY/INNOVATION; SOFTWARE PREDICTS RADIO WAVE ACTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHLEEN WIEGNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Wireless computer networks hold the promise of eliminating expensive wiring 
and cabling in office complexes and granting the flexibility to move equipment 
around without rewiring. But transmitting interference-free radio signals 
within buildings is a complex engineering problem. A new software package 
developed by engineers at Georgia Tech Research Institute to predict how radio 
waves transmit and reflect inside structures could help solve this problem. 
</P>
<P>
 The software, called a cell engineering tool, was developed through an applied 
research program sponsored by Hitachi Telecom USA Inc. It helps make educated 
judgments about where to locate the wireless base stations within a building. 
The ability to quickly choose the best locations should minimize the number of 
stations necessary and thus reduce the system's cost. To come up with their 
experimental measurements, researchers measured and characterized radio signal 
propagation in high-rise office structures, several Georgia Tech buildings, a 
few warehouses and the Inforum building in downtown Atlanta. The information 
was used to develop a baseline set of information that was then used to predict 
how a given signaling system would work. 
</P>
<P>
 While the software will not work for every building, researchers hope to 
refine it to work with a large enough percentage of possible cases to make it a 
valuable tool.  
</P>
<P>
 Eric Barnhart, a Georgia Tech research engineer, and Les Pickering, another 
senior research engineer, are considering starting a company to commercialize 
the technology. 
</P>
<P>
 From Hubcaps to Lasers: The shiny, chrome-plated bumpers and hubcaps that 
adorned classic cars such as the Chevrolet Bel-Aire, Ford Fairlane and porthole 
Thunderbird may ultimately pave the way for a new generation of semiconductors 
so small they can be measured by layers of atoms. 
</P>
<P>
 The process of electrodeposition, which uses an electrical current to deposit 
a layer of metal onto another substance, has been around for a long time. But 
though it's good for chrome bumpers, it doesn't have the degree of control 
needed to form an electronic-grade material. 
</P>
<P>
 Now John Stickney, an electrochemist at the University of Georgia, has 
developed a technique that may make it possible to electrodeposit materials for 
a wide variety of electronic devices, including the lasers in compact disc 
players or detectors for infrared instruments, heat-seeking missiles and night 
vision goggles.  
</P>
<P>
 For the last five years, Stickney has been experimenting with ways to 
alternately electrodeposit one-atom-thick layers of two or more elements in a 
1-to-1 ratio to form a compound -- rather than using the crystal structures 
employed in traditional electrodeposition. His recently patented technique, 
Electrochemical Atomic Layer Epitaxy, is more environmentally friendly than 
other deposition methods because it doesn't produce a lot of toxic waste gases. 
</P>
<P>
 And theoretically, the technique should cost less since it uses smaller 
amounts of chemicals. One compound Stickney has experimented with -- cadmium 
telluride -- has the potential to produce very efficient photovoltaic cells 
because the compound has the ability to absorb light very effectively. 
</P>
<P>
 Better Computer Brains: Computers were once known as "electronic brains," but 
it soon became obvious that the human brain works very differently than a 
computer. Neural networks have attempted to electronically mimic how brain 
cells function, but commercializing them has been slow work. For one thing, the 
real neural networks of the brain use a massive point-to-point 3-D 
interconnection scheme that is impossible to realize on a two-dimensional chip. 
</P>
<P>
 The traditional alternative has been a time-shared "bus," or data channel, 
that switched between the various points to be connected. But normal digital 
busing schemes destroy the analog characteristics of a signal -- especially 
timing, which is critical for the brain to detect motion. Imagine a train 
moving toward you. The brain perceives this motion because the visual (analog) 
signals arrive over time. Should the image of the train arrive digitally in one 
burst, the train would appear to be motionless. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Applied Neurodynamics, based in Encinitas, Calif., has announced that it 
has managed to fold the three-dimensional topology of the brain into a 
two-dimensional representation appropriate for semiconductor chips, without 
destroying the continuous nature of time. 
</P>

 A digital-signal processor attaches time stamps to each pulse as it emerges 
from an analog neuron. The time stamp is broadcast onto the bus along with its 
destination code. Circuitry at the destination neurons pick out only the 
signals intended for them and synchronize them in time-stamp order. A 
board-based prototype proving the concept has been designed with researchers at 
Caltech and Britain's Medical Research Council.

PRESSING FOR A NEW VISION OF GOD; AUTHORS: KAREN ARMSTRONG LEFT THE CONVENT, 
DOUBTING HER FAITH. NOW SHE WRITES TO ANSWER HER OWN SPIRITUAL QUESTIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In the convent, the pale nun from the English countryside suffered blackouts, 
crying spells and hallucinations. 
</P>
<P>
 When she left in 1969, she felt like Rip van Winkle, a stranger to the world 
of Vietnam and the Beatles. Finally, she lost her belief in God. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, living in a Victorian cottage in London, she is the controversial 
author of 10 books, the most recent -- "A History of God" -- an account of the 
Lord that has ruffled a few of the faithful with its unorthodox look at 
Christianity, Judaism and Islam. 
</P>
<P>
 Karen Armstrong, 49, pours herself a glass of mineral water during a recent 
book-tour visit to Los Angeles and begins expounding on everything from a 
mystical encounter with God at the library to theologian Martin Luther's remark 
that women should be "kept at home like a nail driven into the wall." 
</P>
<P>
 Armstrong, who argues that men have "hijacked" and distorted the idea of God, 
says the purpose of her books is to answer her own spiritual questions and to 
"break barriers of hostility and misunderstanding" between Muslims, Jews and 
Christians. 
</P>
<P>
 Her odyssey began in 1962, at age 17, when she entered a Catholic convent and 
sank into an emotional and spiritual abyss. "What I wanted to do was sort of 
lose my adolescent self in this great, fulfilling religious experience, and be 
transformed ... by God and filled with joy and serenity." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, she started doubting her faith and bristling at her religious vows 
("It's very hard to live an entirely celibate life, a life without any 
possessions at all, and to give up your will," she says). She also struggled 
with an uneasy sense of aloneness. 
</P>
<P>
 "In religious life, you don't lose yourself, you find yourself," Armstrong 
says. "Outside, you can turn on the television or go out for a drink... to take 
your mind off yourself. (In the convent), you're stuck with yourself 24 hours a 
day, 365 days a year ... (and) it's quite a salutary experience to learn what 
you're like." 
</P>
<P>
 The break came after the order enrolled her at Oxford University to prepare 
her for a teaching post. There, in contrast to her pre-Vatican II nunnery, 
where unquestioning obedience was a watch phrase, professors insisted she 
criticize and challenge things. 
</P>
<P>
 "I found it difficult to switch that off when I went home," Armstrong recalls. 
</P>
<P>
 One day, she simply collapsed, weeping uncontrollably. Adding to the strain, 
Armstrong also had been experiencing blackouts and hallucinations (caused by 
epilepsy that wasn't diagnosed for another decade). In 1969, she quit the 
order. 
</P>
<P>
 Secular life wasn't much easier. 
</P>
<P>
 As a nun, she had essentially been shut off from the world -- avoiding 
newspapers and outside friendships -- so when she re-emerged, "everything had 
changed." At Oxford she had seen long hair and short skirts, but "I'd never 
heard of Vietnam (and) I'd never heard of the Beatles." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, one of the few times Armstrong's superiors broke their embargo on 
world news was during the Cuban missile crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 "They told us the situation was dire," she says, "but they forgot to tell us 
(when it) was over ... and you weren't supposed to ask for news of the 
world.... (So) we went on (for two weeks) sort of scanning the horizon for 
mushroom clouds, (until) one of us plucked up the courage to (inquire)." 
</P>
<P>
 Armstrong says it took her six years to readjust to secular society. She 
finished Oxford with a doctorate in English literature, started teaching at 
London University and, several years after leaving the convent, became an 
atheist. 
</P>
<P>
 She also began writing books -- first about her experience in the convent, 
then about the trauma of leaving it and finally about such non-autobiographical 
topics as the Crusades, English mystics, the ordination of women, and Mohammed. 
(The latter won her honorary membership in the Assn. of Muslim Social 
Scientists.) 
</P>
<P>
 Most recently, she spent four years assembling "A History of God" (Ballantine, 
1994) -- and, in the process, rediscovered her own faith.  
</P>
<P>
 Armstrong now calls herself a "free-lance monotheist." But her deity is unlike 
any conceived of in traditional spiritual circles. 
</P>
<P>
 She finds God in the library. While poring over religious texts, Armstrong 
says, "I get glimmers of transcendence and wonder -- lasting just a fraction of 
a second -- not dissimilar to the delight or awe you feel when listening to a 
great piece of music." 
</P>
<P>
 If it sounds a little unconventional, well, that's precisely the point. 
</P>
<P>
 Western religions, Armstrong argues, are too hung up on describing and 
defining a reality that defies all explanation. God exists, she says, but 
doctrines, Scriptures and other concepts about him are all man-made. 
</P>
<P>
 Her book sets out to document that the idea of God has been invented and 
reinvented through the centuries in Judaism, Christianity and Islam. 
</P>
<P>
 In so doing, she offers some controversial -- and sometimes contradictory -- 
propositions. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, she writes in one chapter that the opening of John's Gospel in 
the New Testament doesn't suggest that Jesus was divine, only that he "had 
transcended temporal and individual modes of existence." In the next chapter, 
however, she writes about the same verse and reaches the opposite conclusion: 
that John did say Jesus was God. 
</P>
<P>
 Armstrong's own view -- based on sources as varied as Milton's "Paradise Lost" 
and the theories of "handsome" 4th-Century heretic Arius -- is that Jesus was 
merely a "charismatic faith healer" and that doctrines about the Trinity were 
concocted several centuries after the Crucifixion by theologians who 
misinterpreted the words of St. Paul and other apostles. 
</P>
<P>
 She also argues that Catholic stalwart St. Augustine and Protestant reformer 
Luther helped rewrite the early church's respect for women into a "neurotic" 
and "misogynistic" portrayal of females as Eve-like sexual temptresses. 
</P>
<P>
 She regards resistance to women in the priesthood as a shameful distraction 
from "Rwanda, Bosnia ... and (other issues) crying out for a show of 
compassion." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite such critiques, Armstrong is hardly ready to trash religion 
altogether. Atheism and the "growing blankness where God once existed in the 
human consciousness" also seem flawed, she says. "The escalating crime rate, 
drug addiction and the revival of the death penalty are not signs of a 
spiritually healthy society." 
</P>
<P>
 Such a wealth of provocative opinions -- coupled with Armstrong's intriguing 
portraits of saints, mystics and Old Testament prophets -- earned the book a 
good deal of media attention and helped it crack bestseller lists. 
</P>
<P>
 But the text also drew some blood. The San Francisco Chronicle, for instance, 
questioned Armstrong's scholarship and charged that compressing "four millennia 
of history ... into fewer than 500 pages (came) only at the cost of making 
often untenable, broad, sometimes simply erroneous propositions." 
</P>
<P>
 Talk show host Dennis Prager says he was disturbed by Armstrong's branding of 
Jewish prophets as intolerant. "Monotheism was necessary morally and for the 
liberation of the human mind from (paganism and) magic," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Christians also have raised objections. When Armstrong appeared on a Chicago 
radio call-in program, local faithful picked apart the book and its analysis of 
traditional church teachings. 
</P>
<P>
 Armstrong, meanwhile, continues to press for a new view of God. Decrying the 
rise of both fundamentalism and secularism, she says the idea of a personal God 
is outdated and that the world needs a spiritual Einstein to make God 
meaningful and relevant. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had our scientific geniuses," she says. "What we need now are some 
religious geniuses."

ROBIN ABCARIAN: THE CUTEST FORMER BEATLE STILL MAKES A GIRL SWOON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBIN ABCARIAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Twenty-five years ago I would have given a kidney to meet this man, this rock 
star, this cultural icon. I used to dream about him. And so, in all likelihood, 
did you. 
</P>
<P>
 And here I am, improbably, three decades after an entire generation's first 
stirrings of adoration, sitting on a couch in a plush hotel suite with him. 
Contrary to all my adolescent instincts, my inner adult prevents me from 
falling to the floor and wailing: "I'm not worthy!" 
</P>
<P>
 We sit for perhaps an hour, chatting not about music or fame, but about the 
most pedestrian, profound issues a man and woman can face: marriage, 
parenthood, morality. 
</P>
<P>
 He has been the center of attention for more than 30 years, yet it was his 
wife's business that brought him to town; it was she who was occupied with a 
news conference and business matters. He had come, he said, merely in a 
supporting role. 
</P>
<P>
 But let's be honest: People came to see her in hopes of seeing him. That's 
just how it is when you are Linda McCartney and your husband is the cutest 
former Beatle. 
</P>
<P>
 Inevitably, in 25 years of marriage and four children, they have struck an 
accommodation. 
</P>
<P>
 "At home," Paul says, "my fame doesn't count for nothing. I am just Dad and 
she is just Mom and it's as simple as that." 
</P>
<P>
 Sigh. 
</P>
<P>
 If that's the simple life, where can I sign up? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Linda McCartney, in true rock fashion, is late to the news conference she 
called on Friday to introduce her line of frozen vegetarian entrees, featuring 
such dishes as Chili Non-Carne. 
</P>
<P>
 The event, in an anteroom of the Beverly Wilshire Hotel ballroom, draws an odd 
assemblage: A local TV station, a couple of newspapers and rock radio stations, 
fanzines and the vegetarian media, including the host of a radio show called 
"Vegetarian Lifestyles." There is also a smattering of star-struck fans, some 
of whom appear to be doubling as reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 Linda gives a mini-lecture on why everyone should stop eating meat -- it's a 
matter of morality; killing animals is wrong. Just as reporters begin asking 
questions, the cutest former Beatle bounds up from the back of the room, grabs 
a mike and, as he has done in similar news conferences in Seattle and Detroit, 
says: "I wanna know what your husband feels about this." 
</P>
<P>
 It's goofy, it's loopy, and who cares if it's contrived? We are rapt. 
</P>
<P>
 The McCartneys' commitment to vegetarianism, Paul says, springs from an 
epiphany 20 years ago during a leg-of-lamb dinner when he happened to notice a 
flock of lambs gamboling at their farm. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, when we are chatting, he seems a bit miffed when I say the story sounds 
pat. 
</P>
<P>
 "What do you want me to do, make something up that sounds hip?" he asks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lambs gang up at a certain point of the day, and they go for a run together 
and it really is cool. It's a very positive sight to see. They were running 
back and forth shouting, 'Paul! Linda! Help us! Don't eat us!' Then the lead 
lamb jumped up and said, 'Hey man, we need you!' And I said, 'Larry, we're 
gonna do this for you! ' . . . Hey, so is the story getting better? Not so 
pat?" 
</P>
<P>
 The couple can spew statistics about the correlations between rain forest 
destruction and beef production, but in the end, as Paul says, "I know about 
compassion fatigue. It's not like we can't see it. It's not like any time 
anyone brings out something to do with the rain forest, we don't know 100 
people yawn." 
</P>
<P>
 So they tend to resort to more simplistic explanations, sounding like kids who 
have just made the ungroovy discovery that filets and roasts are dead animals.  
</P>
<P>
 "Did you know that meat stays in your stomach for two weeks?" Paul asks. "I 
was saying to Linda the other day, one of the reasons I am glad to be 
vegetarian is if something got stuck in my stomach, I'd rather it was a carrot 
than a bit of dead animal." 
</P>
<P>
 I smile. 
</P>
<P>
 "No, seriously, think about it! You know a dead animal, when you leave it out, 
my God, that thing stinks. I have been a woodsman for a good many years now and 
if there is a dead animal around, I know that smell." 
</P>
<P>
 Paul is also a sheep farmer, although his sheep are raised for wool, spun into 
rugs by Welsh weavers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our sheep die of old age," he says. "I walk past that field in the mornings, 
and I think, there is a field of souls. I say, 'You lucky guys. The luckiest 
sheep in the world, our sheep." 
</P>
<P>
 Lucky, lucky sheep. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Paul and Linda are 52, old enough (and quite willing, he says) to be 
grandparents. Their four children are grown or nearly so: Heather, 31 (from 
Linda's first marriage), is a potter; Mary, 25, is her mother's personal 
assistant; Stella, 23, is a third-year fashion student, and James, 17, is still 
in high school. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul can still make a girl swoon, but mostly it is because nowadays he seems 
like every overworked woman's fantasy helpmate. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the best things about superstardom, he says, is the freedom it has 
given him to be with his children. 
</P>
<P>
 "We never sent them off to schools," he says. "They have always lived with us. 
We would have missed them too much. They're really beautiful kids, and they've 
got hearts as big as mountains." 
</P>
<P>
 He seems happy, well adjusted, extraordinarily normal for a kajillionaire rock 
idol. So what kind of internal struggles does a man like this face? 
</P>
<P>
 "Um, I dunno," he says. "I don't think like that. I don't wake up each morning 
and say, where's the struggle today? I have days that are not as good as other 
days, but it may be just a business thing, something external. Worries, would 
be a better way to put it, about the kids." 
</P>
<P>
 When his daughter Mary was late getting back to the hotel from a shopping 
excursion last Thursday, he and Linda had to calm their fears about her being 
out alone in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "I move into my statistical mode. The chances are a million to one that 
anything would happen to her. That's the kind of struggle I have," Paul says. 
"I mean, no one ever warns you when you have a baby. They're so cute, so 
lovely, but no one warns you from that second on, you'll never stop worrying 
about them. And that to me, would be the great internal struggle." 
</P>
<P>
 Lucky, lucky children.

'90S FAMILY; GOOD RELATIONSHIP BOLSTERS PARENTS' INFLUENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Dr. Deborah A. Cohen , THE HARTFORD COURANT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Parents of adolescents despair over how little say they have with their kids. 
As the threats to their kids multiply -- drugs, alcohol, sex -- parents' 
influence may seem to shrink. 
</P>
<P>
 A recent study in the journal Pediatrics, however, finds that parents have a 
lot of influence over their children -- even though it's primarily indirect. 
</P>
<P>
 The study, of 1,034 fifth-graders and 1,266 seventh-graders in Southern 
California, was designed to find what, specifically, parents do that could be 
linked to children's use of alcohol or tobacco. 
</P>
<P>
 Critical for families is a warm relationship between parent and child. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents "can influence their adolescents by establishing strong relationships 
with them in middle childhood. So if they have that good relationship, and 
children feel they can go to their parents, that they can communicate with 
them, that their parents are there for them, then those children will be 
protected during adolescence," says Dr. Deborah A. Cohen of Louisiana State 
University Medical Center, lead author of the study. 
</P>
<P>
 "They'll be protected in that they'll be less likely to choose friends who use 
substances, and they'll be less likely to get into trouble -- get into fights, 
or be disciplined in school, or take risks. So parents are powerful, but it's 
very clear in the study that it's an indirect effect." 
</P>
<P>
 The researchers expected to find that parents' knowledge of their kids' 
friends would help prevent dangerous practices. "In fact, that doesn't make any 
difference at all. Because parents, even if they know who (their children's) 
friends are, don't know whether those friends use substances or are a bad or 
good influence," Cohen says. 
</P>
<P>
 "Monitoring is important -- knowing where your children are, what they're 
doing. But it doesn't really matter if they know who they're with," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Children whose parents monitored them strongly were about half as likely as 
other students to use alcohol. Similar protective effects were found for 
parents who have effective communication and spend time with their children. 
</P>
<P>
 Researchers found that "the students who do end up using substances, their 
parents absolutely don't have a clue," Cohen says. "Parents who overestimate 
what kind of relationship they have with their kids, or who think their kids 
are OK, are much more likely to have problems than the parents who are 
concerned and have a better idea of what's going on with their children. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a gap between what parents think and what kids think," Cohen says. "I 
think it's helpful if parents check with their kids -- what are they doing, how 
do they feel." 
</P>
<P>
 A warm parent-child relationship "is characterized by parents' providing 
positive feedback through praise, encourage-ment and physical affection," the 
study says. 
</P>
<P>
 "Positive relations appear to be a direct consequence of parents' spending 
time with their children as well as having frequent communication, asking for a 
child's opinions, spending time talking, and sharing secrets and other 
concerns." 
</P>
<P>
 Parents who routinely use praise and affection with their children, rather 
than criticism and anger, are using a "positive feedback system, which 
de-emphasizes aggression and punitive actions," the article says. 
</P>
<P>
 The study did not find a link between single-parent homes and substance use. 
"This is consistent with other studies in which the quality of the overall 
environment and parental attitudes were more important than the number of 
parents," the study says. 
</P>
<P>
 Cohen advises that parents "be positive. It's important to have discipline and 
so on, but what really makes a difference with kids is for them to feel 
positive and accepted -- to have that warm relationship. I know some parents 
can get overstrict and overcritical and so on, but what protects them is the 
positive relationship they have with their children." 
</P>
<P>
 'Positive relations appear to be a direct consequence of parents' spending 
time with their children as well as having frequent communication, asking for a 
child's opinions . . . sharing secrets.' Dr. Deborah A. Cohen

 No toy weapons and no play shooting, Siobhan Vila said.

</P>
<P>
 Chris Boyatzis said no to the "Mighty Morphin Power Rangers." Too violent, he 
said. And he should know. He's the child development professor who made 
headlines last spring when he skewered the masked heroes after studying violent 
outbursts in little Morphin watchers. 
</P>
<P>
 So what did he let his daughter watch, with conditions? The Power Rangers, of 
course. 
</P>
<P>
 Aha, you're thinking. Even those earnest types who start on the high road of 
child-rearing fall from PBS grace with the rest of us, and end up with kids who 
amass plastic arsenals and watch shows featuring slime buckets from the planet 
of Bad Animation, where cheesy action figures are always available. 
</P>
<P>
 Not exactly. Many of these parents say they have found a middle road through 
the traffic of children's mass culture, that land littered with toys and TV 
that just don't compare with the squirt guns and superheroes of yesteryear. 
It's not an easy route and requires constant evaluation. But parents who let a 
little reality in, rather than shutting it out, say they have learned to use it 
rather than be used by it. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to deal with the world," said Barbara Dab of Studio City, whose 
three children are 7, 5 and 15 months. But what happens when it feels like the 
world is winning? Vila said her four boys -- 8, 7, 5 and 3 -- were growing too 
mouthy, rude and pushy last year. It exceeded the usual kid and sibling 
squabbles -- fueled, Vila believes, by peers and television. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't think we had been letting them watch a lot of TV, but they were 
getting so much of it from school it was like they were watching it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Vila and her husband, who live in Burbank, circled the wagons. They began home 
schooling, discontinued their cable service and announced that television would 
be limited to family video nights. Without cable, reception is zilch in their 
neighborhood, so no one even tries to sneak some tube time. 
</P>
<P>
 The children catch occasional shows at friends' houses, but there's no 
clandestine sting to it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't say we can't talk about this or it doesn't exist," Vila said. "If 
they see it at their friends' houses and they come home and they're really 
interested in it I'll say, 'Oh, really. Why don't you tell me about it.' And 
we'll discuss the show."  
</P>
<P>
 As for guns and weapons, the Vilas took their cue from the graham cracker 
incident. They don't buy toy weapons, but if their children craft their own 
from cereal boxes or whatever they find on hand, so be it. While studying the 
history of knights and castles, the boys made swords and jousted about the back 
yard. The rules for combat: even the homespun guns can't be pointed at people 
and swords can't make real contact with a person. 
</P>
<P>
 And the beauty of cardboard weapons? Their life span is short, so Vila said 
the boys don't get stuck on one type of imaginative play. 
</P>
<P>
 "It lasts for two days and then it's gone. And then they're off to a different 
game," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 All this has not made their kids "weird" or too sheltered from the real world, 
Vila said. But are they missing out on the less tangible experience of living 
in and learning from the mass culture, the so-called school of hard knocks? 
Vila said the hard knocks were too hard and frequent to be lessons anymore. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you're having to deal with it day in and day out, you just learn 
survival techniques," Vila said. "You don't learn to deal with it." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Dealing with television is a great part of Boyatzis' professional and personal 
life. An assistant professor for child development at Cal State Fullerton, he 
led a small but provocative study that found that children, particular boys, 
were six times more likely to throw karate-style punches and flying kicks at 
their playmates after watching a single episode of the "Mighty Morphin Power 
Rangers." 
</P>
<P>
 The show's creators denied that the show spawned violent play and noted that 
each episode ends with a reminder that the fight scenes are fantasy. 
</P>
<P>
 Boyatzis said that message runs past children like water through a sieve. It's 
time-consuming, but the better bet is for parents to watch television with 
their children. That has been Boyatzis' tack with his 8-year-old daughter. Yes, 
even with the Power Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I realized I was creating sort of the forbidden fruit syndrome and the more I 
said no, and the more she saw her friends talking about it at school, the more 
interested she was in watching," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 So they watched it for a few days. Together. They talked about the show. He 
asked leading questions, of course, like why did she suppose they just fought 
and never tried to work things out first? Or how do you think real people would 
survive 20 kicks to the head? While the Power Rangers themselves are a mix of 
genders and ethnicities, how do you feel about the source of evil always being 
a Japanese woman and the source of good always being a white male? 
</P>
<P>
 His daughter's interest in Power Rangers faded, but she still watches only 
about four hours of selective television a week. Boyatzis remains a virulent 
critic of what he calls "fast and furious" fighting shows. 
</P>
<P>
 "People always say, well, gosh, the Lone Ranger and Superman, they always beat 
up the bad guys too. Anyone from that generation and I'm one of them, too, 
knows that the moral play, the good versus evil, was the primary draw or focus 
of those programs," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Children are going to generate these themes and play with good versus evil . 
. . and that's natural. That helps them figure out the world." 
</P>
<P>
 That's why children relish the age-old theme in television and movies, but 
adding combat instructions in the form of high-action drama tweaks it out of 
childhood proportions, Boyatzis said. 
</P>
<P>
 Guns have long been a part of that sort of childhood play. But many parents 
who well understand the value of imaginative play, and children's need to feel 
grown up by playing grown up, struggle with the gun thing. 
</P>
<P>
 Dab, the Studio City mother of three, and her husband won't buy toy weapons. 
Even a sword that came with an Aladdin Halloween costume raised concerns. Their 
son got to keep the sword, but they still nix the guns. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're so prevalent in the children's world now. . . . I'm afraid that they 
get desensitized to what it really is," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, she wonders. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm never 100% sure we're doing the right thing," she said. "It's a struggle 
of conscience." 
</P>
<P>
 And sometimes a struggle with the kids. Janet Hendley-Granville's son often 
begs for toy guns. He sometimes gets angry that they're denied, but 
Hendley-Granville, a Fullerton resident, stays calm and sticks to the same 
explanation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't like what they symbolize. I understand that they're play, but I 
believe this is too important to just play with. The meaning of it, what it 
does is too powerful to make into a game or to play with," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 If nothing else, she said the process has forced her to do what parents have 
to do anyway -- set limits and share their principles. 
</P>
<P>
 "It made me redefine what I really believe in," she said. "It made me really 
stand in front of him and tell him what I believe."

REAL LIFE: '90S FAMILY; INSIDER TIPS FOR PRYING LOOSE THOSE LITTLE LIPS 
</P>

 What's the problem? Nothing.  
</P>
<P>
 What happened at school? None of your beeswax.  
</P>
<P>
 Were you smoking? Leave me alone.  
</P>
<P>
 One of the missions of childhood is to keep personal business personal. But 
the equal -- and opposite -- task of parenthood is to get kids to communicate. 
Parents think they're being loving and well-meaning. Kids think they're being 
invaded. 
</P>
<P>
 Some children are naturally reserved. But in general, most clam up because 
it's the easiest way to deal with pressure. The best ways to get them to open 
up are gentle, subtle and indirect, said Linda Braun, executive director of the 
Cambridge, Mass.-based Families First parenting program. 
</P>
<P>
 She said direct questions pressure younger children to reveal thoughts they 
might not have even formulated yet. Or they might feel their answers won't 
measure up. 
</P>
<P>
 Particularly humiliating to children are questions from parents who clearly 
know the answer already: "Did you forget the rule about jumping on the 
furniture?" 
</P>
<P>
 From age 11, children's reluctance to communicate is often part of a 
developmental need to separate. They talk on the phone to their friends and 
make a sanctuary of their rooms. 
</P>
<P>
 But according to Braun, communication is one of the three essentials of 
parenting -- along with discipline and fostering self-esteem -- and parents 
should persevere.  
</P>
<P>
 One way is to make statements (such as, "I see red paint on your shirt. I bet 
you painted today.") as opposed to asking questions ("What did you do today?"). 
</P>
<P>
 Many parents have noticed that timing and the right environment can also be 
crucial. 
</P>
<P>
 Feeding them first helps, said one mother from La Jolla. "You won't get 
anything out of them if they're hungry -- especially the boys," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Phyllis Stephens, 66, of Laguna Hills, said she learned to trap her three 
children with a nearly completed jigsaw puzzle. "When I had one going, 
especially on a rainy day in front of a warm fire just as they trooped home 
from school, I would have just enough completed with a couple of obvious 
omissions glaring as they passed my card table. As they pulled up a chair the 
dramatic episodes of their day would unfold easily. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "Once I learned not to react too strongly to a happening, they seemed to stick 
around. When I told my mother of this accomplishment, she sagely asked, 'Why do 
you think I used to ask you to shell peas?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Some parents today say they've achieved similar effects with car trips. Even 
short errands to the store can turn stones into babblers. 
</P>
<P>
 This might happen for several reasons, experts said. They can, for instance, 
avoid the intensity of eye contact. They also know they have their parents' 
rare and undivided attention. 
</P>
<P>
 "A car is perfect," Braun said, as long as the parents are calm drivers. One 
mother said she knew of a mother and daughter who drove off an embankment after 
their conversation led to a physical fight. 
</P>
<P>
 With younger children, she said bedtime is a perfect opportunity to review the 
day and make leading statements such as, "It looked like you had fun playing 
with your friend." When she wants to talk to her own children, Braun takes them 
to a restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 Once kids do open up, it's important for parents to resist the temptation to 
lecture. 
</P>
<P>
 "First and foremost, you have to make a distinction between hearing what's on 
your child's mind and talking to deliver your own message," Braun said. 
Listening to children means hearing what's in their hearts and minds, perhaps 
paraphrasing their messages, and not responding with our own thoughts and 
ideas. 
</P>
<P>
 "What is important is for children to feel that they are valued and to feel 
that their parents are interested in who they are, not in who they want them to 
be."

 The Scene: It could take no less than a cause of mammoth importance to bring 
the rock 'n' roll cave dwellers out on a heated afternoon. But the opportunity 
to help save the financially ailing Millie's restaurant -- a Silver Lake 
landmark built in 1926 that has disappeared and reappeared on the map as many 
times as Poland -- served as a rallying cry to gather the cream of L.A.'s 
nocturnal underground to Downtown's grungy rock mecca, Al's Bar, for a barbecue 
and benefit Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Behind the Scene: The idea was launched by Millie's employee Daniel Keenan, 
who, when he's not slinging hash, plays guitar for the Geraldine Fibbers. "We 
just thought that there are so many musicians that come to Millie's and a lot 
of other entertainment-type people it would be so easy for us to put a benefit 
together," he says. "Being that L.A. is the city of tear-it-down and rebuild -- 
a snap-together Lego house -- I think it's important to keep these types of 
establishments around." 
</P>
<P>
 Who Was There: The lineup, which played from 3 p.m. till 2 a.m., included the 
Geraldine Fibbers, Glue, Pop Defect, the Abe Lincoln Story, Polar Goldie Cats, 
Possum Dixon and Hotsy Menshot, and was hosted by MC's Gaylord -- known, with 
justification, as the Duke of Cornball.  
</P>
<P>
 Chow: The pickings were a tad more refined than you would expect in a rock 
dive -- sausage, glazed chicken and, for veggie palates, plenty of grilled 
peppers and eggplant and salad.  
</P>
<P>
 The Unthinkable Alternative: "I really feel for this cause," said Abe Lincoln 
Story's singer-guitarist Steve Moramarco. "I mean, without Millie's, we would 
be at Yum Yum Donuts with, like, a cup of coffee in one of those Styrofoam 
things and like Sweet'n Low and that non-dairy creamer and some doughnut holes 
with the little sprinkles on them that kind of fall off. And we'd be in a bad 
mood."  
</P>
<P>
 Money Matters: About 400 people showed up over the course of the day and 
evening. $1,850 was raised. In addition to the money collected at the door, the 
restaurant plans to put out a CD of the event, dubbed "Milliepalooza."

 Chris Boyatzis, an assistant professor of child development at Cal State 
Fullerton, may be a vociferous critic of children's television, but he isn't 
naive. He's talked with hundreds of parents concerned about children's 
television consumption.Here are some of his and their best tips. 
</P>
<P>
 * Don't just watch, think. One parent allowed a child to watch the Teenage 
Mutant Ninja Turtles only if the child imagined another turtle into the story 
-- a turtle named Gandhi who resolved the same plot without fighting. 
</P>
<P>
 * Ask children to count the number of violent actions in a single episode. 
They'll probably lose count. 
</P>
<P>
 * Permit the favorite shows as long as the fighting isn't imitated. 
</P>
<P>
 * Put kids on a TV diet. Let them watch a favorite show once or twice a week, 
but not daily. 
</P>
<P>
 * Finally, watch television with the kids so you can guide discussions and 
help children develop critical thinking about what they see, including 
commercials. DAWN BONKER

FLUOR UNIT ORDERED TO PAY $6.1 MILLION IN OVERBILLING CASE; COURTS: IRVINE 
FIRM'S SOUTH CAROLINA SUBSIDIARY, EARLIER FOUND GUILTY OF CHARGING TOO MUCH TO 
REPAIR NAVAL BASES, WILL APPEAL AWARD TO FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND 2 FORMER 
WORKERS.

 A unit of construction and engineering giant Fluor Corp. must pay the federal 
government and two former employees more than $6.1 million for submitting 
heavily padded repair bills for cleaning up Navy bases after Hurricane Hugo 
tore through South Carolina in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 FD Services, a Greenville, S.C., subsidiary of Irvine-based Fluor, was found 
guilty by a federal jury in Charleston, S.C., in May of overbilling the 
government at least $2 million for cleaning up Charleston-area Navy bases after 
the hurricane. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 4,700 housing units and 800 other buildings on the bases that dot 
the coastal area were damaged in the storm. 
</P>
<P>
 Fluor spokeswoman Deborah Land said that FD Services denies any wrongdoing and 
will appeal the award by U.S. District Judge David Norton. The company's 
attorneys began preparing the appeal in May when the jury decision was 
announced in what began as a federal whistle-blower suit in 1992 by two fired 
FD Services managers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We believed then and we believe now that there was no wrongdoing, and we will 
vigorously defend our position," Land said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Norton's decision, entered Oct. 5 and received by both sides in the case 
Monday, apparently triples the damages that the jury determined -- a punitive 
award permitted under federal law when a company is found to have fired workers 
for informing the government of overbilling or other problems connected with 
federal contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 The plaintiffs in the case, James Ferguson, a contract administrator, and 
George Pitt, a service manager, were FD Services employees who complained to 
government officials that the company had overcharged for Hurricane Hugo 
cleanup work. 
</P>
<P>
 They later were terminated and subsequently filed a wrongful termination suit 
against FD Services, contending they were fired for blowing the whistle on the 
company. 
</P>
<P>
 Ferguson, who was awarded $171,000 for wrongful firing, could not be reached 
for comment Tuesday but was quoted in a Charleston newspaper as saying that the 
decision "is a victory for the American people and the American taxpayers." 
</P>
<P>
 The government will get about $4.3 million of the award; the rest goes to 
Ferguson, Pitt and their lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
 FD Services' repair work became one of the most expensive federal public works 
project that followed the storm. 
</P>
<P>
 According to testimony in the trial, costs rose out of control. Confidential 
FD Services memos showed that company managers acknowledged the project's 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
 FD Services' lawyers admitted that company officials mismanaged the Hugo 
repairs but blamed some of the troubles on Pitt and Ferguson. "The attorneys 
were saying that there were things that could have been handled better," Land 
said, "but this was a crisis situation." 
</P>
<P>
 Some witnesses also blamed Navy officials and labyrinthine Navy rules and 
regulations for the high repair costs. 
</P>
<P>
 FD Services contracts to provide a variety of facility maintenance and 
construction work. The company was created after the 1986 merger of Fluor and 
Daniel International Corp. of Greenville. 
</P>
<P>
 It originally had a mix of government and commercial clients but in the past 
18 months has shifted its focus completely to commercial work and no longer has 
government contracts, Land said. 
</P>
<P>
 For a significant federal government contractor, Fluor has been relatively 
unscathed by contract fraud. Currently the company has more than $2 billion in 
government work. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the FD Services case, the only other active contract fraud 
matter against the company involves a so-called whistle-blower suit recently 
filed against Fluor's Ohio subsidiary, Fermco. The suit alleges that Fermco is 
mismanaging its contract to clean up the closed federal uranium processing 
facility in Fernald, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1986, a former Fluor contract administrator was sentenced to four years in 
federal prison for accepting $1.4 million in bribes from subcontractors 
building a petrochemical plant in Saudi Arabia. Fluor itself was not implicated 
in the case, but the company was required to refund $2.7 million to the joint 
venture corporation it formed with the Saudi government to build the $5-billion 
facility.

NME TO BUY RIVAL AMERICAN MEDICAL; ACQUISITIONS: THE $3.3-BILLION DEAL, WHICH 
INCLUDES 4 O.C. HOSPITALS, AIMS TO SPUR FIRM'S COMPETITIVENESS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 National Medical Enterprises said Tuesday that it will acquire rival hospital 
chain American Medical Holdings in a $3.3-billion deal that would nearly double 
its size and strengthen its presence in the key Southern California and 
southern Florida markets. 
</P>
<P>
 With the hospital industry undergoing a massive restructuring, National 
Medical's acquisition would ensure that the Santa Monica company -- now the 
nation's second-largest health care firm -- remains a significant player, 
analysts and company executives said. 
</P>
<P>
 It would also increase the likelihood that National Medical, which was likely 
to be swallowed by a competitor if it didn't strike first, can remain 
independent. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the deal is not quite the blockbuster that National Medical Chairman 
Jeffrey Barbakow had set his sights on. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbakow tried to negotiate a complicated three-way merger with Dallas-based 
American Medical and HealthTrust Inc. of Nashville. If completed, it would have 
transformed National Medical into a health care giant nearly equal in size to 
Columbia/HCA Healthcare Corp., the nation's largest health care concern. 
</P>
<P>
 But Columbia/HCA, based in Louisville, Ky., quashed Barbakow's plan a week ago 
when it bid $3.4 billion for HealthTrust. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of becoming a national force almost overnight, National Medical will 
have to settle for becoming a bigger player in specific U.S. markets. Besides 
California and Florida, the American Medical deal would also give the firm a 
strong presence in New Orleans and Texas. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will never be the biggest health care company in the United States; that 
is not our goal," Barbakow said. "We will try to improve our position in the 
markets we serve." 
</P>
<P>
 The new company would have $5.3 billion in combined revenue and 84 hospitals 
in 13 states and overseas.  
</P>
<P>
 Among the hospitals to join under one roof would be four Orange County 
facilities with a total of 639 beds and 2,180 employees. The cost savings in 
the merger would come mainly at the corporate level, and layoffs will occur 
there, not at any of the hospitals, said NME spokeswoman Diana Takzam. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbakow called the American Medical deal "the very best transaction" 
available to the company and said more acquisitions are likely. 
</P>
<P>
 "You'll see a lot of deals quickly," he said, adding that they will probably 
include acquisitions of one or two hospitals in certain markets. He said the 
company will look closely at possible acquisition of nonprofit hospitals, many 
of which are struggling financially in an era of medical cost cutting. 
</P>
<P>
 But Barbakow said the company is also exploring some larger hospital 
acquisitions, though most of the biggest chains have been snatched up in other 
mergers. One exception is Nashville-based OrNda Healthcorp., a 48-hospital 
chain with a strong presence in California, which some analysts have suggested 
as a good match for National Medical. Barbakow wouldn't comment on any 
discussions with OrNda. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts had mixed reactions to the deal. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Villwock of Johnson Rice & Co. in New Orleans praised the deal as "a 
tremendous operating merger" with "a lot of synergies." 
</P>
<P>
 But Dean Witter Reynolds' Todd Richter said National Medical's move was "one 
of desperation. Putting NME and American Medical together doesn't get you the 
critical mass you need to survive in the future." 
</P>
<P>
 Barbakow said the merger would allow the company to negotiate better deals 
with health insurers because of the size and breadth of its facilities in 
Southern California. It would create especially strong operations in Southern 
California -- which would account for half the combined entity's revenue -- and 
in southern Florida, Louisiana and Texas. 
</P>
<P>
 National Medical owns eight hospitals in Southern California, including its 
Los Angeles flagships, Century City Hospital and USC University Hospital. In 
Orange County, it runs Los Alamitos Medical Center, with 173 beds and 740 
employees, and Placentia Linda Community Hospital, with 114 beds and 325 
employees. American Medical operates five hospitals in Southern California, 
including Garden Grove Hospital and Medical Center and Irvine Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a hospital in Century City and now we have ones in Tarzana and 
Encino, plus Orange County," Barbakow said. "We'll have the critical mass to go 
to the employers in Los Angeles and say, 'We have the following assets and 
services across Southern California.' " 
</P>
<P>
 But one health care executive said National Medical may still not have enough 
facilities in the huge Los Angeles market to gain the marketplace clout it 
seeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't seen any HMOs that are willing to sign a contract with one medical 
system," said Terry Hartshorn, chief executive of UniHealth America, a 
Burbank-based health care company that owns nine hospitals in Southern 
California. "This marketplace is so complex and competitive now that 15 
hospitals isn't a big enough critical mass to create much of anything." 
</P>
<P>
 The $3.3-billion valuation for American Medical includes the assumption of 
about $1.3 billion in debt by National Medical. 
</P>
<P>
 National Medical shares fell 62.5 cents to $15.625 on Tuesday in heavy New 
York Stock Exchange trading. American Medical shares rose $1.625 to $24. 
Barbakow said no decision has been made on where to locate the corporate 
offices if the deal is completed.  
</P>
<P>
 The new company will be renamed, "but all I can tell you is it will not have 
NME in it," Barbakow said in a telephone conversation. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Barbakow took the top job at National Medical 15 months ago, the company 
has struggled to overcome its negative image after a swamp of legal and ethical 
problems. In July, the company paid $380 million to settle federal criminal 
fraud charges and pleaded guilty to six counts of paying kickbacks for the 
referral of Medicare patients. 
</P>
<P>
 It also paid more than $200 million to settle civil suits brought by insurers 
and former patients over allegations of fraud, overbilling and patient abuse, 
primarily involving the company's psychiatric hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
 National Medical has divested most of those facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Until 1990, American Medical was based in Beverly Hills.

RECURRING RENT DISPUTE FORCING EATERY TO MOVE; RESTAURANTS: IRVINE'S BISTRO 201 
CLOSED SATURDAY. IT WILL REOPEN IN NEWPORT BEACH SOON, MANAGERS SAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES S. GRANELLI, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 A rent dispute that closed Bistro 201 for a week last year has resurfaced and 
is forcing the well-known Irvine eatery to move, the restaurant's operators 
said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Bistro closed Saturday night and will reopen at the former Shane at Newport 
Beach on Coast Highway as early as Oct. 19, said Frank Licata, Bistro's 
executive manager. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're walking away from the lease," Licata said of the Irvine location. "We 
have been trying to negotiate with the landlord for a lower rent for a few 
months but they have refused to negotiate with us." 
</P>
<P>
 The landlord, World Trade Center II in Tokyo, padlocked the restaurant in 
July, 1993, over $230,000 in unpaid back rent. Bistro sought protection from 
creditors in U.S. Bankruptcy Court but quickly dismissed its petition when the 
dispute appeared to be settled five days later. The restaurant then reopened. 
</P>
<P>
 Licata said the settlement included a cooling-off period of about three months 
and a commitment to renegotiate the high-rent lease. But negotiations never 
took place, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Executives at World Trade Center II could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Bistro is owned by West Coast Restaurant Ventures Inc., which also owned Shane 
and, before that, the Barbacoa Restaurant at the Newport Beach site, just south 
of Newport Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 Employees were caught by surprise when they learned of the move Friday. As 
many as 15 of the restaurant's 45 employees won't be working at the new 
location because the Bistro won't be serving lunch -- a big draw at the Irvine 
location -- when it reopens. 
</P>
<P>
 For now, though, all are helping with the relocation. And the parent company 
is trying to place the luncheon workers at other restaurants it owns or at its 
catering operation. Four employees have already found positions, Licata said. 
</P>
<P>
 The catering company, West Coast Productions, had used the Shane facility for 
weddings and other events. Bistro will continue to honor the events that have 
been booked there through the next year and will continue to book banquets and 
other private parties there, Licata said. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the present time, we're not phasing out the catered events and have no 
plans to resume lunch service, though we may put on Sunday brunch," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bistro 201 will reopen with much of the decor from its past location, 
including the booths, paneling and decorations. The goal is to make the place 
as familiar as possible to regular Bistro customers, said Teresa Boole, newly 
hired sales promotion coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
 The menu also will remain the same, though chef John Sharpe is expected to 
come up with a few new seafood dishes to fit into the beach scene. The new 
facility will have about 200 seats, Boole said, and they will be arranged to 
give all diners a view of Newport Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 "We still believe in our concept here," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 West Coast Restaurant, however, no longer wants to follow the Southwest 
cuisine concept that former co-owner David Wilhelm developed at the company's 
Zuni Grill in Irvine. It changed the menu to home-style cooking and changed the 
name to Saddlerock Ranch. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilhelm, who is now a consultant to Taco Bell Corp., also led the development 
of other West Coast restaurants, including Kachina in Laguna Beach, Diva in 
Costa Mesa and Topaz in the Bowers Museum in Santa Ana.

PACIFIC BELL PLANS TO CLOSE ITS 2 DIVISIONS IN ANAHEIM; JOBS: THE FACILITIES 
EMPLOY 220, BUT OFFICIALS GIVE NO NUMBERS OF IMPENDING LAYOFFS OR TRANSFERS TO 
SITES IN TUSTIN AND SAN DIEGO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Pacific Bell said Tuesday that it will close two of its Orange County 
divisions, which together employ 220 people, by early 1996 and shift those 
operations to newly expanded facilities in Tustin and San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 Company spokesman John Britton said Pacific Bell "doesn't have any numbers" on 
how many employees will be laid off or offered transfers as part of the 
consolidation, which he said is necessary to meet new competition. 
</P>
<P>
 The closures come as part of a restructuring announced in January that the 
company said would save it about $1 billion by the end of 1997. Pacific Bell 
said that it would cut its work force by 10,000 over the next four years, 
including 3,000 in 1994. The company expects to have 41,000 employees at the 
end of 1997, down from a peak of 95,700 employees in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
 In Anaheim, Pacific Bell will close a network operating center at 217 N. Lemon 
St., which currently has 120 employees. Its operations will be moved to an 
existing center in San Diego, which will eventually have between 240 to 260 
employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Pacific Bell also plans to close its Anaheim customer service center, at 200 
N. Lemon St., which has about 100 employees, and shift that work to an expanded 
facility in Tustin, which also will have between 240 to 260 workers, Britton 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other operations will remain in the North Lemon Street buildings, which will 
not close, Britton said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tustin also will receive a residential service center, which will be moved 
from Riverside, with about 140 employees. It will be at the Pacific Bell 
buildings on Edinger Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 The announcement Tuesday was part of an overall Pacific Bell move to combine 
40 network and service centers into nine. The company said it will save more 
than $100 million in real estate costs by 1998 as a result of the 
consolidations and other space-saving moves, such as sharing work space, and 
having some managers work from their homes. 
</P>
<P>
 On Jan. 1, Pacific Bell will begin competing with long-distance carriers for 
in-state toll calls. Cable television companies also are trying to offer local 
telephone services as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Company spokeswoman Jill Foley said that some employees would be required to 
move to keep their jobs, but that the company will pay moving expenses. In many 
cases, workers would be able to commute to the new offices, she said.

BLOOMINGDALE'S WEIGHS 2 LOCAL SITES FOR NEW STORE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBORA VRANA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bloomingdale's would like to open its first Orange County store at South Coast 
Plaza in Costa Mesa, but the ritzy New York retailer is still eyeing other 
options, an executive said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our first choice for Orange County is South Coast Plaza, but Fashion Island 
is something we are looking at," said Christine Miller, executive vice 
president of marketing for Bloomingdale's in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 The well-known East Coast retailer is expected to open only one Orange County 
store, with both South Coast Plaza and Fashion Island in Newport Beach 
competing for the prestige of having the New York retailer pick them. Both 
shopping centers cater to affluent shoppers. 
</P>
<P>
 Bloomingdale's has said it plans to open three department stores in Los 
Angeles and Orange counties -- its first on the West Coast. It is leaning 
toward building a flagship store on Beverly Drive in Beverly Hills but has not 
ruled out a site in the Century City Market Place Mall, Miller said. That store 
is expected to open in March, 1997. 
</P>
<P>
 While South Coast Plaza and Beverly Hills are the top choices right now, 
Miller said, the retailer is still weighing other possibilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Federated Department Stores in Cincinnati, the parent company of 
Bloomingdale's, said site selections have not been completed. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's been no decision made," spokeswoman Carol Sanger said. "What is fair 
to say is that we are very interested in various sites. Some may pan out, and 
some won't." 
</P>
<P>
 Frederick Evans, president of the retail division of Irvine Co., which owns 
Fashion Island, said Irvine Co. officials continue to negotiate with 
Bloomingdale's. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nothing has been decided yet, and I suspect it won't be until next year," 
Evans said Tuesday. Fashion Island and South Coast Plaza, he said, have "both 
been competing for Bloomingdale's." 
</P>
<P>
 Executives of C.J. Segerstrom & Co., South Coast Plaza's owner, would not 
comment. A Bloomingdale's insider confirmed, however, that delegates from 
Segerstrom were in New York on Friday to meet with officials of the retailer. 
</P>
<P>
 The Southern California stores, wherever they open, will be huge, Miller said, 
and designed to showcase the company's best merchandise. 
</P>
<P>
 "Both Bloomingdale's and California are known for having things first, so 
there's a good synergy here," Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
 Retail experts said Bloomingdale's would be an economic benefit for whatever 
community the company chooses, boosting sales tax revenue and likely bringing 
business to adjacent stores. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be a coup to get Bloomingdale's to Orange County," said Pam Evertz, 
vice president at Hall Olson Marketing Group, a retail consulting firm in 
Irvine.

RELATIONSHIPS / ORANGE COUNTY: EXERCISING TACT WHEN DISCUSSING OLD FLAMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE BAWDEN DAVIS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Most of us have been with a boyfriend, girlfriend or spouse when an ex-flame's 
name is mentioned. While a little past information is often welcomed, some 
people don't know when to stop talking about their old relationships. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't have much patience for guys who can't stop talking about what 
horrible things old girlfriends did to them," says Katie, a 25-year-old Orange 
chemist, who asked that her last name not be used. "Once I get the point, I 
don't want them to continue." 
</P>
<P>
 Katie doesn't appreciate it when someone constantly praises an ex either. 
"Although it's always nicer when a new boyfriend talks positively about an ex, 
I don't think anyone should glorify a former partner," she says. "It just makes 
me feel bad. I also wonder, if things were so wonderful, why did they break 
up?" 
</P>
<P>
 Katie would prefer that her boyfriends do as she does and just give her the 
essential facts. 
</P>
<P>
 "I say just enough to a current boyfriend to let him know what I didn't like 
about a past relationship and what went wrong, so hopefully we won't repeat the 
same mistakes," she says. "Then I shut up, and I expect him to do the same." 
</P>
<P>
 When a lover brings up a past relationship, whether you turn red-hot with rage 
or become curious will depend on why the information is being shared, says 
Saeed Soltani, a Santa Ana psychologist, who often performs couple therapy. 
</P>
<P>
 "If a person is continually bringing up a past relationship, he or she hasn't 
resolved past issues and those issues are contaminating the current 
relationship," he says. "The person needs to resolve the anger and confusion 
over the past before continuing with the new relationship." 
</P>
<P>
 Bringing up a past relationship to measure a new person against an ex-flame is 
also very destructive, says Soltani. "If a woman says to her boyfriend, 'You're 
acting just like my ex-husband,' she's driving a wedge between them." 
</P>
<P>
 Mentioning another partner to evoke anger or jealousy is also bad news. 
</P>
<P>
 If, on the other hand, a person is describing a significant situation that an 
ex-partner was a part of, then that would be a reasonable reason for 
reminiscing, Soltani says. The beginning of a relationship is also a natural 
time to share information about former lovers. 
</P>
<P>
 "The start of a relationship is a discovery period for couples, and it's not 
unusual to talk about ex-partners at this time," says Soltani. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sharing past relationships is a natural part of trying to get to know one 
another and can reveal valuable information," he says. "Knowing what worked and 
didn't work in past relationships is a critical part of building a strong 
foundation for the new relationship." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Katie appreciates brevity when it comes to talking about the past, 
she does rely on the information she receives from new boyfriends. 
</P>
<P>
 "What people say about their past relationships is much more revealing than 
what they say about themselves," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 When they talk about an ex, it can often be a good indication of whether the 
new relationship has a chance. 
</P>
<P>
 "If he describes how something an old girlfriend did bugged him," says Katie, 
"and I do the same thing, then I know we've got a problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Ann, who asked that her name be changed, is a 55-year-old Santa Ana lawyer. 
She has two main reasons for finding out about a boyfriend's past 
relationships: "For obvious reasons, I want to know where that person has been 
sexually, and, as a feminist, I am keenly interested in what a man thinks of 
women. If he is continually discussing female partners in a negative manner, 
that will probably stop the relationship for me." 
</P>
<P>
 To get at the truth about past relationships, Ann says she asks open-ended, 
non-threatening questions of men. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rather than asking why a man divorced his wife, which will often elicit a 
planned answer, I will ask something very innocent, such as how he met his 
ex-wife. That kind of question doesn't raise any walls, but a man's answer and 
the way he talks about his ex-wife can be very revealing," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Ann has found that men usually don't ask her questions about past 
relationships. When she's interested in continuing a relationship, she will 
disclose things about ex-partners so that the man gets to know her better. 
</P>
<P>
 Although men may not ask questions, they are often just as curious as women, 
says psychologist Soltani. 
</P>
<P>
 "Men may not want to admit their interest, because it could be seen as a sign 
of weakness, so they will tend to camouflage their curiosity," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Joe, 29, an Irvine resident who is a director of sales and marketing in the 
telecommunications industry, says that he's found some women to be quiet about 
past relationships. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some women aren't very verbal or open about the past," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 When Joe is with women who are slow in revealing information, he tries to 
focus on the present and future, and hopes that nothing drastic went on in the 
past. He's been in situations, however, where it would have been better to know 
crucial information about their past sooner in the relationship. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't know that a woman I was living with had told her old boyfriend she 
was living with her sister. I also didn't know she had just come out of a 
relationship with him," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that people should be open right from the beginning, no matter what 
happened in past relationships," he says. "That way the person you're with 
knows what he or she is dealing with and will better understand you." 
</P>
<P>
 When it comes to sharing information, Joe doesn't want details, though. "I 
don't mind if someone tells me about a past boyfriend, but I don't want to get 
in depth about the things that happened. If I really care about a woman and her 
ex-boyfriend was very bad to her, it just makes me angry with him and want to 
strike back." 
</P>
<P>
 Dave, 40, has been separated for three years and was recently divorced. While 
dating, he has discovered that although he also doesn't like details, women 
often demand them. 
</P>
<P>
 "Women will want to know every detail about my marriage and what went wrong -- 
exactly what happened and on what dates," says Dave, who lives in Huntington 
Beach and works in the oil industry. 
</P>
<P>
 If he's close to a woman, he doesn't mind sharing intimate information, and 
hopes she wouldn't mind either. 
</P>
<P>
 "I not only like to know about a woman's sexual past, I also think that her 
emotional past is important because it tells me how she deals with 
relationships and if she takes responsibility for what's going on," he says. 
"Finding out why a person stayed in a marriage and what happened to the 
marriage is very revealing."

O.C. MUSIC; MINIMALISM'S MAXIMUM POWER; COMPOSER OF 'THE PIANO' IS COMING TO 
COSTA MESA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT KOEHLER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the days before the first American appearances by his 17-year-old Michael 
Nyman Band, the composer of the music from "The Piano" was rummaging through 
his cellar in London and turned up some interesting things. 
</P>
<P>
 One is the program for his own first U.S. gig, at the Kitchen in New York City 
in 1980, not with the band but with American sidemen. Nyman also has found his 
note-filled copy of Peter Greenaway's screenplay for "The Draughtsman's 
Contract" (1983), a film for which he wrote the score and which catapulted both 
him and Greenaway to a level of international fame neither had imagined. 
</P>
<P>
 "We certainly didn't expect the film to have the impact that it did," Nyman 
said on the phone from his home. "I know he was surprised, and I was. You think 
that after one success you become streetwise and cynical. Yet again, I didn't 
expect that the music for 'The Piano' would have the impact it did." 
</P>
<P>
 That film's soundtrack recording held the top spot on the classical crossover 
charts for six months. "I didn't write it with a view of making any sort of 
'popular' impact," Nyman said. "Sounds bizarre, but that's the case." 
</P>
<P>
 The programs he has selected for his tour with the band -- which stops at the 
Orange County Performing Arts Center on Thursday -- represent still more 
rummaging of a sort: They cover the range of his composing career from "The 
Draughtsman's Contract" and his never-recorded "The Fall of Icarus" to a 
concert suite based on music written for "The Piano," to be augmented in Costa 
Mesa by members of the Pacific Symphony. 
</P>
<P>
 The programs will vary from venue to venue during the band's dizzying 16-day, 
14-city trek, a breakthrough for Nyman generated by the hot "Piano" soundtrack. 
The pieces to be played in Segerstrom Hall will afford an overview of nine 
years of his work -- some of the world's most dynamic, iconoclastic 
music-making. 
</P>
<P>
 Reviewing "The Piano" soundtrack in the New York Times, K. Robert Schwarz 
said, "It has always seemed surprising that Nyman has not achieved the 
popularity in the United States that his near-contemporary and stylistic peer 
Philip Glass has." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But though Glass, Steve Reich, John Adams and other American composers led the 
charge in the '70s for the style called Minimalism (a term, ironically enough, 
coined by Nyman, in his former life as a music critic), a consensus is emerging 
that the Nyman Band delivers the most powerful concerts of Minimalist-inspired 
music anywhere. (Nyman himself now avoids the Minimalist label.) 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone who only knows the band from recordings is overwhelmed by the impact 
of the band live," Nyman said with pride. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the only ways to prepare are with the live recording of the band in 
Tokyo ("The Essential Michael Nyman Band," Argo Records), which suggests the 
superhuman, propulsive, raucous nature of the music, and the newer "Michael 
Nyman Live" album (Virgin), recorded in Spain in May with the same nine- member 
band that is coming to Orange County. (A 14-member group also tours). 
</P>
<P>
 With the addition of such virtuosi as John Harle on sax ("the most important 
classical soprano sax player in the world," Nyman calls him), Andrew Findon on 
baritone sax and Kate Musker on viola, Nyman (who always conducts from the 
piano) and company have come a long way from their genesis in 1977 as an 
accompanying ensemble for a National Theatre production of Carlo Goldoni's "Il 
Campiello." 
</P>
<P>
 What started as musicological research for Nyman's composer friend and 
National Theatre music director Sir Harrison Birtwistle turned into a "kind of 
street band that didn't exist in Venice in the 18th Century," Nyman said. "So I 
just used my imagination. We made the group sound as raw and rough and loud as 
possible without amplification, and combined diverse instruments from 
completely different periods -- Medieval-era rebecs and 20th-Century 
saxophones. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here was this fantastic sound unlike any other, and I felt rather sad that it 
would end when the production did. I don't know why or when I was forcibly 
struck by the idea that this group should stay together. 
</P>
<P>
 "I realized that we had no original material. So, of necessity, I became a 
composer. One of these early pieces, 'In Re Don Giovanni,' is a sort of 
paradigm of what I've done since. It became a model for rhythmic patterns, for 
an energy level, and a way of framing classical music in a 20th-Century 
context. It's exciting to have it on the new 'Live' album." 
</P>
<P>
 Nyman said Greenaway recognized "quite generously and honestly that that piece 
showed how it was possible to make something simultaneously period music but 
with late 20th-Century ideas and aesthetics."  
</P>
<P>
 The piece thus informed the music for "The Draughtsman's Contract" and led to 
a tight filmmaker-composer collaboration similar only to that of Federico 
Fellini and Nino Rota. Thursday's concert will include pieces not only from 
"Draughtsman" but from Greenaway's "A Zed and Two Noughts" and "Water Dances," 
adapted from Greenaway's short "Making a Splash." 
</P>
<P>
 The union broke somewhat bitterly after "Prospero's Books" (1991) which, 
though it provided Nyman with a chance to write a kind of mini-opera, also 
included music that Nyman said he didn't approve. He and Greenaway have not 
spoken since. While Greenaway embarked on opera and film collaborations with 
Dutch composer Louis Andriessen, Nyman went onto "The Piano," Diane Kurys' 
"Seven Days, Seven Nights" and the upcoming "Mesmer" starring Alan Rickman. 
</P>
<P>
 Film scoring actually is a small part of Nyman's life, which he is devoting 
more and more to opera (his chamber opera "The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a 
Hat" is available on a CBS recording) and small ensemble and solo settings, 
such as his recent "Songbooks" recording (Argo) with Ute Lemper. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though he is one of Europe's most in-demand composers -- a typical 
project is "Musique a Grand Vitesse (MGV)," commissioned by the French railway 
system to celebrate the opening of the Paris-to-Lille high-speed train -- Nyman 
remains controversial in England, where conservative critics regularly lambaste 
the band's amplified concerts. Barry Millington of the London Times has 
dismissed Nyman's work as "sewing-machine music elevated to an art form." 
</P>
<P>
 "They are behind the times," Nyman said, "and, on the other hand, they go to 
one of my concerts, hate the amplification, then go home and listen to a Mozart 
piano concerto, which is of course amplified on their CD players. So their 
distinction is totally phony." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, Nyman said, there is a practical reason for amplifying the band: "At 
a certain point, I found that the old Campiello Band's ancient music 
instruments weren't able to play the music I was writing, so they faded out of 
the group in much the same way as they originally faded out of Western music 
culture. I added a bass guitar and electric guitar simultaneously, adding a 
total propulsive attack. 
</P>
<P>
 "With the electric guitar being amplified, all the other instruments had to be 
amplified. I'm very much a child of John Cage and his notions of chance in 
music, and all of the things which have happened in the band have come about 
through chance and organic development. I never sat down and thought, 'Well, in 
order to put this music over, we have to be amplified.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Just as he chafed at being ignored by the motion picture academy for his 
"Piano" score, he senses that some, in the music Establishment and audiences 
alike, sense that the "Nyman sound" is fundamentally simple repetitions of 
dramatic chords. 
</P>
<P>
 "The music, looks simple on the page," he acknowledged. "But in order to get 
the style right and keep it going for an entire concert, you have to be a 
virtuoso musician. "Andy Findon, for instance, may play the baritone sax for an 
hour straight, then pick up the piccolo and play it with equal virtuosity. The 
energy these players have to put out is not just like sitting down with a few 
programmed keyboards and letting them do the work. My players are pumping out 
constant jaw-breaking and arm-breaking energy, which is very much what the 
music is all about." 
</P>
<P>
 * The Michael Nyman Band plays Thursday at 8 p.m. at the Orange County 
Performing Arts Center, 600 Town Center Drive., Costa Mesa. $18 to $30. (714) 
556-2121.

A CHRISTMAS WISH: FILMGOERS; MOVIES: WITH DEC. 25 FALLING ON A SUNDAY THIS YEAR 
AND AN UNPRECEDENTED NUMBER OF RELEASES PLANNED, IT'S GOING TO BE A SEASON OF 
HEATED COMPETITION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD NATALE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 If it were up to movie distributors, Christmas would never fall on a Sunday. 
But this year it does. 
</P>
<P>
 The holiday signals the beginning of the biggest filmgoing week of the year 
and is a great launching pad for movies with strong adult appeal such as last 
year's "Grumpy Old Men" and 1990's "Godfather III," according to 
Columbia/TriStar distribution head Jeff Blake. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Sunday holiday alters the picture. Normally, most films are released 
on Wednesday or Friday. And, Christmas Day moviegoing usually doesn't begin in 
earnest until that evening after presents are open and dinners eaten. This 
year, an unprecedented seven films will vie for that audience on Sunday, Dec. 
25: the romantic comedy "I.Q.," starring Meg Ryan and Tim Robbins; the remake 
of "Little Women," with Winona Ryder; Robert Benton's comedy-drama "Nobody's 
Fool," featuring Paul Newman and Bruce Willis; the baseball biography "Cobb," 
with Tommy Lee Jones in the title role; the Beethoven-era romance "Immortal 
Beloved," starring Gary Oldman; Roman Polanski's adaptation of "Death and the 
Maiden," with Sigourney Weaver and Ben Kingsley; and the family drama "Safe 
Passage," with Susan Sarandon. 
</P>
<P>
 All of these offerings, only two of which are national releases, follow on the 
heels of another seven films set to debut the previous Wednesday and Friday. 
Fanning out in more than 1,000 theaters on Dec. 21 are Disney's live-action 
"Jungle Book"; "Richie Rich," starring Macaulay Culkin; and Robert Altman's 
fashion comedy "Pret-a-Porter." 
</P>
<P>
 Two days later, the Jean-Claude Van Damme actioner "Streetfighter" bows 
nationally along with three limited-run movies: the period dramas 
"Restoration," starring Robert Downey Jr. and Hugh Grant; "Queen Margot," with 
Isabelle Adjani; and "Colonel Chabert," starring Gerard Depardieu. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Any way you slice it, six wide releases in the period of five days will result 
in a heightened contest for the audience's attention, especially since little 
business will be done in the last few shopping days before Christmas. The 
latecomers will also have to fight for space with several other high-profile 
December releases such as the drama "Nell," starring Jodie Foster, and the 
romantic comedy "Speechless," pairing Geena Davis and Michael Keaton, to 
mention just two. 
</P>
<P>
 The strategy of Christmas Day release is to avoid any December dog days. As 
Fine Line Pictures president Ira Deutchman points out, why spend advertising 
money to get people into theaters before Christmas, when the audience is not 
available? Why not save it all for after Christmas dinner when the annual 
moviegoing pilgrimage begins? 
</P>
<P>
 The Sunday holiday, however, throws a bit of a monkey wrench into those plans, 
admits Paramount's distribution president Barry London. "From a business 
standpoint this is not a good Christmas in general," he says. "You have no 
Saturdays." (Christmas Eve is the nadir of the movie year and New Year's Eve is 
not much better.) 
</P>
<P>
 Another complication is that most of the Christmas Day releases are aimed at 
older audiences who often make their film-going decisions by reading reviews. 
Many national newspapers don't carry reviews on Sundays since entertainment 
sections are printed in advance. Many of those movies will be reviewed on 
Friday, Dec. 23, cramming as many as 10 reviews into a single issue, "which 
means your review may get buried," asserts London. This is an unfortunate 
predicament since some of the limited releases look to capitalize on potential 
Oscar consideration and year-end critical kudos. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, space problems in many papers will result in some reviews showing up 
on Saturday, Christmas Eve, or even the Monday or Tuesday after Christmas. 
Consequently, the Sam Goldwyn Co.'s distribution executive Eamonn Bowles 
decided to risk missing a couple of days of prime Christmas business and skip 
to Dec. 28 to debut Mira Nair's "The Perez Family." 
</P>
<P>
 Since many of the limited releases will do most of their business in January, 
Fine Line's Deutchman predicts there may still be some last-minute juggling. 
</P>
<P>
 For wide releases, however, it may be too late. Last week, Disney decided to 
skip the heat and get out of the kitchen, pulling its Dec. 25 planned release 
of "Roommates," starring Peter Falk, and bumping the family comedy-drama into 
the first quarter of the new year. The rest of the Christmas wide releases are 
staying put since advertising commitments have been made and there's little 
room for maneuvering prime-time TV slots during one of the most costly times of 
year.

MR. BERKOFF, PLEASE TAKE CENTER STAGE; THE BRITISH PLAYWRIGHT OFFERS A RARE 
SOLO TURN IN THE FOOTLIGHTS FOR UK/LA FEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAN BRESLAUER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles has been good to Steven Berkoff. The edgy British 
actor-playwright-director, best known for his virulent portraits of 
working-class anomie, has staged many of his plays here -- including 
"Acapulco," "East" and the long-running "Kvetch," all at the Odyssey Theatre 
Ensemble. 
</P>
<P>
 But he's almost unknown as a thespian. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, although Berkoff is a popular staple of the British stage, he's been 
on the boards only once in L.A., in "Decadence" in 1984. And he's never before 
performed a solo show in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Until tonight, that is. Berkoff's "One Man" is part of "3X3: Great Solo 
Performances," a UK/LA 1994 festival event that included last weekend's 
presentation of Lynn Redgrave's "Shakespeare for My Father," as well as this 
week's performances of Miriam Margolyes' "Dickens' Women," all at UCLA's Freud 
Playhouse. 
</P>
<P>
 The frequently outspoken Berkoff has been known to rail against the 
Establishment and other targets, but he goes surprisingly easy on L.A. "I've 
always liked working in L.A.," he says, speaking by phone from his London home. 
"It's an environment that I find stimulating and responsive. Since they don't 
have so much theater, there is often a keener appreciation and more 
open-mindedness about new ideas and new drama." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Berkoff's performance is being co-produced by UK/LA, the UCLA Center for the 
Performing Arts and L.A. Theatre Works' Susan Albert Loewenberg, who first 
brought Berkoff to L.A. in 1982 with "Greek," which the writer directed at the 
Matrix Theatre. Loewenberg also produced Berkoff's "Agamemnon," which the 
writer directed for the Olympic Arts Festival, and "Decadence," which Berkoff 
performed in as well as directed, both in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been looking for opportunities to bring him back, but I felt that the 
theater scene here was so hopeless," says Loewenberg, who first saw Berkoff's 
"One Man" in London last Christmas. "He is one of the great physical actors of 
his generation, and it's nowhere more in evidence than in this show." 
</P>
<P>
 Berkoff, the 57-year-old child of Russian Jews, grew up in East London. His 
numerous works for the theater include an adaptation of Franz Kafka's "The 
Metamorphosis" that featured Roman Polanski in Paris in 1988 and Mikhail 
Baryshnikov on Broadway in 1989. Berkoff himself often performs in his own 
stage plays, and he has also acted in a range of films, from "A Clockwork 
Orange" to "Rambo: First Blood, Part II" to TV movies. 
</P>
<P>
 "One Man," which Berkoff performed in London's West End and at various other 
places around England late last year and through the beginning of this year, 
consists of three short works: Edgar Allan Poe's "The Telltale Heart" and 
Berkoff's own "The Actor" and "Dog." 
</P>
<P>
 Berkoff sees Poe's tale of a man who buries a body underneath the floorboards 
as a "study of obsession." It's also a vehicle that allows the versatile actor 
to demonstrate "an A to Zed of acting techniques, a compendium of styles." 
</P>
<P>
 "The Actor," inspired in part by a Marcel Marceau mime piece, portrays an 
actor making his way along the treadmill of unemployment. Berkoff walks 
continuously as he tells this story of the endless process of auditioning. 
"Actors are vulnerable and giving, and they're ruthlessly exploited," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 More so than the other two works in "One Man," "Dog" features an archetypical 
Berkoff character -- an aimless thug -- and his pit bull. The versatile Berkoff 
plays both the boozing "yob" and his pooch, Roy. 
</P>
<P>
 Before coming to L.A. for "One Man," Berkoff was performing a double bill of 
two of his one-act plays in London: "Sturm und Drang," a parody on greed done 
in rhyming verse, and "Brighton Beach Scumbags," a story about four 
working-class people who take a trip to Brighton. The title of the latter is a 
jab at Neil Simon's "Brighton Beach Memoirs." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet though he's been busy, Berkoff is always eager to play here. "In L.A., 
without the background of traditional drama, there is a more rapid appreciation 
of the radical movements. People are not strangled by tradition. They just see 
what is there and absorb it." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Berkoff is not without criticism of his West Coast base. "What I regret is 
that in such a large city as Los Angeles there are not more professional 
theaters," he says.  
</P>
<P>
 But the greater problem may be the market economy that allows few theaters to 
survive. "It's terrible that there shouldn't be at least six huge theaters that 
are subsidized," says Berkoff, alluding to the British system that supports 
stage companies such as the Royal National Theatre. "All subsidy pays off. You 
get a more equitable society, and you preserve the great artistic traditions. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you go for the market, you're always playing to the idiots, the lowest 
common denominator and you get schlock," Berkoff continues. "You subsidize 
until people have the chance to get used to you." 
</P>
<P>
 * "3X3: Great Solo Performances," Steven Berkoff's "One Man" (today and 
Friday, 8 p.m.; Sunday, 7 p.m.); Miriam Margolyes' "Dickens' Women" (Saturday, 
8 p.m.; Sunday, 3 p.m.); Freud Playhouse, UCLA. $25. (310) 825-2101.

OVATIONS GIVE NOD TO TAPER, DOOLITTLE; THEATER: CENTER THEATRE GROUP AND 
ACTORS' GANG SHOWS LEAD NOMINATIONS IN LOCAL, PEER-JUDGED AWARDS. 
</P>

 Center Theatre Group shows at the Doolittle Theatre and the Mark Taper Forum 
dominate the list of nominees for the Ovations, which are being touted as the 
first peer-judged, competitive awards to cover most of the professional 
theaters in Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 The CTG/Ahmanson series at the Doolittle roped in 30 nominations, including 11 
for "Five Guys Named Moe" and nine for "Falsettos" -- the most frequently cited 
shows on the list. Taper shows added another 14 nominations to the CTG honors. 
Andrew Lloyd Webber's "Sunset Boulevard" got eight nods. The Actors' Gang won 
11 nominations, more than any other sub-100-seat theater, but the seven honors 
for the Colony's revival of "Working" were more than the nominations for any 
other sub-100-seat show. 
</P>
<P>
 In a ceremony in Century City Tuesday, celebrities announced five nominations 
in each of 24 competitive categories and a single lifetime achievement award -- 
for producer and impresario James A. Doolittle. 
</P>
<P>
 The awards will be passed out at the Alex Theatre in Glendale on Nov. 14, at a 
gala presentation to be emceed by John Larroquette. 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives from many of the 119 members of Theatre LA -- an organization 
of theaters and production companies -- graded shows throughout the period of 
eligibility, from September, 1993, through August, 1994. But only those voters 
who sent in score sheets for at least 25 shows may vote in the upcoming final 
round, and voters must have seen all five nominees in each category to vote in 
that category. 
</P>
<P>
 All but three nomination categories have separate awards for larger and 
sub-100-seat theaters. 
</P>
<P>
 The nominees: 
</P>

 CBS placed only five programs among the Top 20 last week, but since one of 
them was three hours long, the defending prime-time champion was able to record 
its first victory of the young season. 
</P>
<P>
 Figures released Tuesday by the A.C. Nielsen Co. showed that CBS' nightlong 
coverage of the Country Music Assn.Awards on Wednesday, dominated by Vince 
Gill, ranked 11th among the week's 92 prime-time network programs. The previous 
week, CBS' highest rated Wednesday series had finished 57th. 
</P>
<P>
 After three weeks, CBS continues to rank third in the season standings, but 
the race is tight and the network says its new series are delivering 20% higher 
ratings than what the programs in the same time periods garnered during the 
last three months of 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, however, only NBC and Fox are showing higher ratings among all 
households compared to the first three weeks of last season. NBC, bolstered by 
an improved Tuesday lineup, is up 11% and Fox has gained 7%, while CBS is down 
11% and ABC has lost 6%. Southland Ratings

 CIA staffing -- Because of erroneous figures supplied by the Central 
Intelligence Agency, The Times reported incorrectly Monday that 20% of the 
agency's station chiefs were women as of last month. The CIA said Tuesday that 
only 8.4% of the station chiefs are women.
