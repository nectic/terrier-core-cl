MOST REWARDS TO SOLVE CRIMES AREN'T CLAIMED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HUGO MARTIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The brutal slayings of Hee Wan Yoo, his wife and two children in their Granada 
Hills home more than two years ago left investigators struggling to solve a 
crime without suspects, witnesses or motives. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoping to generate leads, the Los Angeles City Council offered a $25,000 
reward for information that would help solve the slayings. Although the reward 
was doubled by Yoo family relatives and renewed last month after it expired, it 
has remained unclaimed. Concrete leads have yet to come in. 
</P>
<P>
 But unclaimed rewards are not unique. About 80% of the rewards offered by Los 
Angeles city and county officials over the past two years expired without being 
claimed, according to city and county records, begging the question: Why don't 
rewards work more often?  
</P>
<P>
 Despite the low success rate, most law enforcement officials still believe in 
the concept, saying rewards provide a valuable incentive. 
</P>
<P>
 "We often have someone who is wavering about whether they want to share their 
information, and (rewards) are just an added incentive," said Los Angeles 
Police Lt. Al Moen, head of the department's major crimes division.  
</P>
<P>
 But some police and government officials say privately that rewards are not a 
reliable crime-fighting tool. Instead, they are seen as a tool of the 
politicians and a way for the grieving families to feel they are helping to 
solve the crime. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many times it means something to the family," said one homicide investigator. 
"They feel more is being done if a reward is being offered." 
</P>
<P>
 Rewards have been a staple of the American justice system as far back as the 
1800s, when posters pinned to saloon doors offered rewards for the capture of 
train robbers and cattle rustlers -- dead or alive.  
</P>
<P>
 Today, most rewards are offered by government agencies or relatives of the 
victims for particularly heinous crimes. Television has gotten into the act 
with a slew of programs that re-enact crimes and offer rewards for callers with 
information.  
</P>
<P>
 Some reward programs, such as the city of Los Angeles' graffiti reward 
program, are highly successful. Since 1991, the city's program has paid out 
$85,500 in rewards to more than 100 people who have helped capture graffiti 
vandals. 
</P>
<P>
 But because such rewards are offered on an ongoing basis, it is difficult to 
compare their success rate with programs that offer rewards for a particular 
crime and for a limited time.  
</P>
<P>
 In the past 24 months, the Los Angeles City Council paid out 10 rewards, 
totaling $190,000, according to city records. But during the same period, 63 
rewards, totaling $1.5 million, expired without being claimed, records show.  
</P>
<P>
 Rewards offered by the County Board of Supervisors do not fare much better. 
Five rewards, totaling $55,000, have been paid out in the past two years, while 
20 rewards, totaling about $206,000, expired without being collected, according 
to county records. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the most part, they are never claimed," said Georgette Dame, a supervisor 
of the county reward program.  
</P>
<P>
 Rewards offered by the city usually expire 60 days after they are offered; 
county rewards expire after 90 days. But the rewards can be extended or renewed 
at the request of a county supervisor or City Council member.  
</P>
<P>
 Law enforcement officials say there are many explanations for the low 
collection rate of such rewards. The main reason, they say, may be that 
witnesses or other sources of information are afraid of reprisals if they call 
police. 
</P>
<P>
 Police say the best sources of information are often accomplices in a crime or 
friends and family of the criminals -- people who have much to lose by 
providing police with information. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County Sheriff's Lt. Frank Merriman said rewards often do not work 
because "you are trying to entice the shady person, the associate of the 
criminal." 
</P>
<P>
 Another reason may be that rewards are often only offered for the crimes that 
are the most difficult to solve, such as murders. According to the most recent 
FBI statistics, the percentage of homicides solved nationwide dropped from 90% 
in 1960 to 65% in 1992.  
</P>
<P>
 Gary Auer, head of the FBI's office in Ventura County, said no amount of 
reward will help if no one has information about the crime except for the 
criminals themselves.  
</P>
<P>
 "It can be that a crime is committed by one or two people and they have kept 
their mouths shut," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 Most often, Auer said, law-abiding citizens with information do call police, 
regardless of whether a reward is offered. He said the FBI gets dozens of tips 
daily on bank robberies, but "not more than one in 20 asks if there is a 
reward." 
</P>
<P>
 "Generally, we have not seen that rewards have been a significant motivating 
concern," he said.

'BLUE FLU': EXPENSIVE EPIDEMIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Against the advice of even their staunchest supporters, including Los Angeles 
Police Chief Willie L. Williams, more than 200 LAPD officers called in sick on 
Monday and again on Tuesday rather than report to work. The epidemic of "blue 
flu" allowed rank-and-file cops to vent their understandable frustration over 
the lack of a police labor contract with the city -- but at what cost? Possibly 
more than even the most generous labor contract could compensate for: public 
confidence. 
</P>
<P>
 The protest was the low point so far in the long and acrimonious labor 
negotiations. The police have been working without a contract or pay raise 
since 1991. That is clearly unacceptable, and not just to the average cop. The 
average city resident wants police officers to be paid adequately for the 
important and often dangerous work they do. In the best of times, that kind of 
consensus would make for an easy settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the last three years have not been the best of times for Los Angeles, 
or the LAPD. The furor that followed the Rodney King beating and the resulting 
turmoil still reverberates. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, like local governments all over recession-bound California, Los 
Angeles is short of cash. City employees have had to defer pay hikes as a 
result. 
</P>
<P>
 The one noteworthy exception is the Department of Water and Power work force, 
which reached a much-criticized contract with the city after a strike. That set 
the unfortunate precedent the Police Protective League seized on. 
</P>
<P>
 But being a police officer is different from being a utility worker. Being a 
member of the LAPD used to be seen as something special -- a calling more than 
just a job. 
</P>
<P>
 It surely doesn't look that way now. It appears, sadly, that even the Police 
Department has been undermined by the what's-in-it-for-me mentality that is so 
commonplace in society now. Why else would men and women who swear to uphold 
the law -- with their very lives, if need be -- break the law through an 
illegal job action like this week's "blue flu"? 
</P>
<P>
 Though most Angelenos support higher pay for police, they will not support the 
"anything goes" attitude of some officers, who probably justify their stand as 
a legitimate means to an end. Not all officers of the department embrace such 
hardball tactics. Will their voices be heard over the din of rhetoric?

FISCAL CLOUD OVER THE GAZA STRIP; WORLD CANNOT ALLOW PLO ADMINISTRATION TO FAIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Off to a stumbling political start as it seeks to oversee self-rule in the 
Gaza Strip and Jericho, the Palestine Liberation Organization now faces the 
staggering prospect of financial collapse within months after assuming 
authority. 
</P>
<P>
 PLO officials on the ground -- Chairman Yasser Arafat remains in Tunis -- 
aren't the only ones frightened by the possibility. Israel, in what some would 
see as an ironic twist, is pondering ways to channel emergency help to the 
Palestinian interim government to keep it afloat. This isn't altruism. It's 
prudent self-interest. If the PLO can't provide for the necessities of life in 
the territories it now seeks to govern, its already damaged legitimacy could be 
terminally undermined. That would open the door to at least an attempted 
seizure of power by Muslim extremists. What could follow concerns Israel 
enormously. It ought to concern nearly every Arab state, along with Europe and 
the United States no less. 
</P>
<P>
 The World Bank and 40 donor countries that were brought together by the United 
States last October have pledged a total of $2.4 billion over the next five 
years to sustain Palestinian self-rule. Much of that is earmarked for specific 
projects and a lot will consist of equipment and training and other in-kind 
services. 
</P>
<P>
 The Palestinians say that with all these pledges they have up to now seen 
almost no cash. Without cash, workers in essential services will go unpaid and 
soon will stop going to work, fueling popular disaffection and weakening the 
governing authority's standing even more. 
</P>
<P>
 Dilatory donors aren't wholly to blame, however. Once again responsibility 
goes to the apex of the Palestinian hierarchy, to Arafat, who has always kept 
the PLO's finances -- including its extensive investment portfolio -- under his 
own secretive control. An accounting of what the PLO has, or has left after 
decades of notoriously high living by its top officials, is long overdue. At 
the same time Arafat can blame only himself -- although of course he won't -- 
for the loss of hundreds of millions in aid from the PLO's once-generous oil 
state benefactors, a circumstance he brought about by rushing to approve Iraq's 
invasion of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
 Noting all this, those concerned with stability in the Middle East can still 
only conclude that the Palestinian experiment in self-rule remains too vital to 
the security interests of too many countries to let collapse. Donor nations 
must act quickly to speed up their cash transfers, not to save Arafat from his 
own folly but to give the Palestinian people a chance to evolve toward the 
democratic and secular society that the PLO has for so long portrayed as their 
destiny.

A DISPLAY OF DREAMS; MOCA SHOW FEATURES ASSORTED REDEVELOPMENT PLANS FOR 
DOWNTOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "The long reign of the Community Redevelopment Agency ended this week -- not 
with a bang, but with a brief reference on Page 4 of Mayor Richard Riordan's 
budget message," William Fulton wrote recently in this newspaper's Opinion 
pages. 
</P>
<P>
 The CRA reign may indeed wind up yielding to some kind of reorganizational 
interregnum, but if it does it at least will go with a small bang. "Urban 
Revisions, Current Projects for the Public Realm," the just-opened show at the 
Museum of Contemporary Art, includes Elizabeth Moule and Stefanos Polyzoides' 
CRA-sponsored "Strategic Plan" for Downtown Los Angeles among an assortment of 
redevelopment plans. 
</P>
<P>
 The show's catalogue says the plan "grew out of a five-year-long public 
process directed by a 65-member committee representing a wide range of 
interests." Clearly, imagination as well as money was spent freely, and no one 
who works Downtown can view the plan without a sigh for what might have been. 
</P>
<P>
 The dreamlike quality about the results may, of course, be a part of the 
problem. An elegant pen drawing shows "proposed housing cluster adjacent to St. 
Vibiana Cathedral," currently one of the squalid encampments of the Downtown 
homeless. "The Los Angeles Theater in the proposed Broadway Theater 
Entertainment District," with searchlights piercing the sky, will leave 
incredulous anyone who recalls the sad demise of the Los Angeles Theatre 
Center, just a block away on Spring Street. 
</P>
<P>
 In other moments, the MOCA show and its catalogue try to be tough-minded about 
what urban design can and cannot be expected to do. But a hope that people 
problems may take care of themselves seems to spring eternal in the 
architectural breast. If people were added to another project in the MOCA show 
-- Johnson, Fain, Pereira Associates' otherwise appealing "Greenway Plan for 
Metropolitan Los Angeles" -- they would surely be homeless. Doesn't that change 
rather a lot? 
</P>
<P>
 "Urban Revisions" is rich in inspiration, in short, but, particularly with the 
future of the CRA in mind, it stands also as a perhaps unintended warning.

GUN CONTROL WATCH; HELP WHERE IT'S NEEDED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Although many urban and suburban California counties -- including Alameda, Los 
Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino, San Diego and San Francisco -- are 
besieged by escalating gun violence, a statewide preemption law bars them from 
imposing tougher gun control measures than the Legislature has approved. 
</P>
<P>
 AB 2706, by Louis Caldera (D-Los Angeles), would end the state's exclusivity 
in the area of firearms and ammunition regulation.The bill would allow local 
governments to, for example, require gun licensing or registration. Also, 
localities would be able to experiment with a host of measures as long as there 
was no conflict with state law. 
</P>
<P>
 The fierce debate over guns traditionally has been a confrontation between 
urban and rural values. Forbidding local governments to pass gun laws may sound 
more reasonably in a place like, say, Yolo County, where only four people were 
shot to death in all of 1992. However, the law clearly damages the public good 
in a densely populated city like Los Angeles, where in 1992 nearly 2,000 people 
died from gunshots and at least four times that number were treated for bullet 
wounds at county hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
 Sacramento hasn't passed a major piece of gun control legislation since 1991. 
If it will not speed up its pace in dealing with this issue, then at least it 
should allow violence-weary, bullet-riddled cities like Los Angeles some 
measure of choice in controlling guns. The Legislature should release its 
chokehold on local communities and allow them to take constructive action on 
their own.

UCLA CELEBRATES 75TH ANNIVERSARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Your May 21 article, "Address Marks Start of UCLA Celebratory Year," was 
another example of your bias against UCLA. Despite the headline, 80% of the 
article bashed UCLA by reiterating a list of challenges that UCLA has faced in 
the recent past. Why can't a small part of your focused and undivided attention 
be devoted to the good in the news? The fact that one of the top-10 
universities in the world is celebrating a milestone anniversary with the 
President of the United States is newsworthy. Yet, your "higher education 
reporter" was assigned to the Rose Bowl ticket issue. How can you justify 
putting that story on the front page while relegating the President's speech to 
an inside page? It now appears that your editorial, "A Gem on the Rim" (May 
19), was merely a bone thrown to UCLA in light of your true journalistic 
priorities. 
</P>
<P>
 When something good happens in Los Angeles that directly affects more than 25% 
of your readers, then can't your talented staff devote a similar quantity of 
their energy to that story? More than 25% of your subscribers have been 
educated at UCLA. Maybe it makes financial sense to start thinking about a 
significant audience who is continuing to grow weary of your monopolistic 
negativism. 
</P>
<P>
 Regardless of your UCLA bashing, we will move ahead with our anniversary 
celebration with greater enthusiasm to raise the important banner of higher 
education and the role that UCLA can continue to play in the health and 
well-being of Los Angeles.

was unable to focus on the many positive contributions of the university. UCLA 
faculty, staff, students and alumni serve a broad range of constituencies in 
Los Angeles through their involvement in the Venice Family Clinic, Unicamp, 
Christmas in April and myriad other community service programs. UCLA has 
contributed countless innovative research projects in fields as widespread as 
biotechnology, film preservation, education and physics. 
</P>
<P>
 It was also unfortunate that the contributions of UCLA's outstanding alumni 
were overlooked. Accolades and awards have been given to many UCLA alumni, from 
the public servants such as Nobel Peace Prize laureate Ralph Bunche, former 
Mayor Tom Bradley and Supervisor Yvonne Brathwaite Burke, to athletes such as 
Arthur Ashe and Jackie Joyner-Kersee, from artists Francis Ford Coppola and 
Agnes de Mille, to astronauts Walter Cunningham and Anna Lee Fisher. They 
represent just a few of the many who work daily to contribute to the success of 
UCLA and the greater community.

 For recent evidence, we note Chancellor Charles Young's sell-out to Angelo 
Mazzone, wherein Mazzone gets 4,000 Rose Bowl tickets, many ticket seekers get 
frozen out and UCLA picks up a "gift" of $100,000 from Mazzone (May 21). This 
is certainly a major scandal, and renders moot much of what UCLA purports to be 
all about. You would do well to at least acknowledge such problems.

 Has this man ever thought that perhaps the reason for our pessimism and

any presidential blaming and whining. In my opinion, the man just doesn't "get

NUCLEAR WEAPONS AND NORTH KOREA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Robert Manning's article (Opinion, May 22) expresses alarm that North Korea, 
because of "the pattern of empty U.S. threats," may feel "emboldened" to 
develop nuclear weapons. Manning proffers several plausible explanations why 
U.S. admonishments concerning the development of nuclear weapons languish, not 
considered seriously by other countries. However, Manning omits mentioning the 
one country that is the source of the United States' lack of credibility over 
the issue of nuclear non-proliferation: Israel. Bosnia, Serbia, Somalia and 
Haiti have nothing to do with the paucity of U.S. credibility over nuclear 
weapons. (Do they possess nuclear weapons?) U.S. lack of credibility extends 
back to the 1950s and 1960s when Israel clandestinely began to develop nuclear 
weapons. The U.S. neither ordered nor threatened Israel to desist from its 
development of nuclear weapons. Now, the U.S. is paying the price of that 
complicity. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, the U.S. government pretends that Israel does not have nuclear 
weapons. Countries such as Iraq, Iran, India, Pakistan, South Africa and North 
Korea know better. Thus, it is with incredible duplicity and hypocrisy that the 
U.S. demands that those countries abide by the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty 
while it allows Israel to refuse to sign the treaty and to refuse to permit 
international inspections of Dimona.

 * In your May 21 article, "N. Korea Crisis Eases as Inspectors Report No 
Nuclear Fuel Diversion," your reporter neglects to report the response from the 
Pyongyang regime as to why blatant violations against the International Atomic 
Energy Agency policy were committed. There is no doubt with the tense stalemate 
of diplomatic talks between the U.S. and North Korea that both should be 
walking on eggshells. 
</P>
<P>
 For North Korea to continue to disregard and even impede the U.N.'s IAEA 
inspection is certainly an egregious act, but to impose sanctions on a country 
whose tattered economy is on its last limb would not effect the changes 
witnessed in its sister country of South Korea. To do so would elicit a crisis 
from which there is no return.  
</P>
<P>
 The United States and United Nations must continue to work through diplomatic 
channels to expand economic and higher level talks. In spite of differences, it 
is the same end result wished by both countries.

BONDS FOR QUAKE COST

<TEXT>
<P>
 Re "Sadly, Prop. 1A Is Needed," editorial, May 18: 
</P>
<P>
 It is truly sad that the Legislature and governor always want to pay 
present-day expenses with future tax revenues. We paid for the San Francisco 
quake with a temporary tax, why not again? Proposition 1A should be rejected by 
the people as a message to our elected officials to go back and do their job 
right. 
</P>
<P>
 It is time we in California quit robbing our children and grandchildren to pay 
our expenses; the federal government does a completely adequate job of that 
already.

HAITI'S ARISTIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jeane Kirkpatrick argues that the United States should not militarily 
intervene to overthrow the Haitian military government (Column Right, May 22). 
She offers two reasons.First, she claims that it would violate both the OAS 
Charter and the U.N. Charter, which prohibits the "use and threat of force 
against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state" 
except in self-defense or where there is a serious threat to international 
peace and security. 
</P>
<P>
 The hypocrisy here is almost too much to take. It was Kirkpatrick who 
repeatedly and vigorously supported the United States' decade-long attempt to 
overthrow the Sandinista government in Nicaragua -- even though the Sandinistas 
received 60% of the popular vote in a 1984 election. Since there could be no 
credible argument that the United States was acting in self-defense or that 
tiny Nicaragua threatened international peace and security, Kirkpatrick's 
current analysis of international law unwittingly offers a compelling 
condemnation of the Reagan and Bush Nicaraguan policy that she supported for 10 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 Second, Kirkpatrick suggests that President Jean-Bertrand Aristide is somehow 
unfit to serve as president of Haiti (even though he was indisputably elected 
to the post) because of his "volatile temperament, his refusal to compromise" 
with the military leaders who overthrew him, and his purported "proclivity for 
violence." Given that Aristide was overthrown by a military coup, forced to 
leave the country at gunpoint, and paramilitary death squads now search out and 
execute Aristide supporters, it seems a bit odd and unbalanced for Kirkpatrick 
to express vague concerns about Aristide's temperament.

BATES ON S. AFRICA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Why doesn't Karen Grigsby Bates ("Why I Envy South Africa," Commentary, May 
18) simply move to South Africa? Why does The Times continue to print 
race-baiting whiners like her and never print anything from African Americans 
who actually have something good to say about America? 
</P>
<P>
 She indicts, by inference, the white middle class for the poor state of 
hospitals, schools, recreation facilities and markets in black 
neighborhoods.Where is the responsibility of the black middle class in all 
this? 
</P>
<P>
 As a black resident of South-Central Los Angeles, I am here to tell you that 
nothing is going to change in our community unless and until we (i.e., the 
folks who live here) pull together to do what it takes -- through hard work, 
not riots -- to effect change. 
</P>
<P>
 And, if all Ms. Bates has to contribute are the same tired complaints against 
the "system," then I submit that she is a major part of the problem.

PERSPECTIVE ON THE ENVIRONMENT; A NEW CONSERVATION ETHIC; THE EDUCATIONAL 
PROCESS BEGINS IN OUR NATIONAL PARKS: HIGHER ENTRANCE FEES, NEW PARKS IN 
UNEXPECTED PLACES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRUCE BABBITT, Bruce Babbitt is secretary of the Interior. (His jurisdiction 
does not include national forests, where budget cuts have led to closure of 
campgrounds, including some in the Angeles National Forest.) 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In its 1916 decree creating the National Park Service, Congress explicitly 
outlined two goals: Preserve the designated sites "unimpaired for the enjoyment 
of future generations," and provide for the public enjoyment of those 
resources. The conflict between preservation and access has forced a creative 
tension on the Park Service since its first days. Achieving balance grows more 
difficult each year. 
</P>
<P>
 As challenging as the mission is, the two goals are not contradictory, 
particularly when one focuses on the nature of the genuine park visitor 
experience. 
</P>
<P>
 The national parks are not about entertainment; Disney, Warner Brothers and 
others are masters at that task, and park rangers need not compete with them. 
Rather, rangers facilitate the American people's encounter with their heritage. 
The challenge is in bringing the visitor to a more intense appreciation of the 
natural world. 
</P>
<P>
 This framework sets new and clear parameters on methods for accommodating more 
visitors.  
</P>
<P>
 Despite annual increases in visitation, for example, the Park Service will not 
be in the road-building business. Roads disrupt, divide and fragment natural 
systems that are the very reason for parks; our challenge is in finding new 
means of visitor transport. 
</P>
<P>
 We will not be in the hotel-building business, but will instead work with 
owners of lands bordering parks so that many overnight needs can be met in 
gateway communities. These communities can also serve as "staging" areas, where 
visitors can learn of a park's facilities, collect materials and shop -- all 
without adding to the milling crowds inside. 
</P>
<P>
 Likewise, the service must consider different methods for protecting its 
resource base, because it is no longer enough to focus on the nature of 
developments within the park. We must begin to focus on parks not as distinct 
entities, but as the centers of ecosystems. 
</P>
<P>
 At Yellowstone, massive herds of elk and buffalo (and soon, perhaps, gray 
wolves) do not acknowledge the straight lines on a map; those animals inherited 
an entire ecosystem, and park staff must work closely with resource managers 
from other state and federal agencies to protect their migration range. 
</P>
<P>
 Everglades National Park is part of a natural system being killed by the 
invasion of exotic plants (caused by nutrient-rich agricultural runoff) and the 
diversion of water for residential and commercial uses. That park's fate lies 
not in the hands of its rangers, but in a massive, multi-agency effort to 
restore the system. 
</P>
<P>
 Sequoia National Park has air-quality problems worse than many large cities, 
but the problems' source lies in faraway industrial centers along the 
California coast and in the Central Valley. Clearly, it is no longer sufficient 
to label land a park and assume it is protected. 
</P>
<P>
 Protecting the resource base also means continuing the search for new sites, 
because America's history and perspectives are always changing. Fifty years 
ago, there was no Martin Luther King Jr. Historical Site to be preserved, 
because that chapter in our history had not yet been written. 
</P>
<P>
 A century ago, we crossed the Midwest in search of scenic splendor, oblivious 
to the extraordinary biodiversity being plowed up and taken for granted. The 
new effort to create a park in the Kansas tall-grass prairie finally 
acknowledges the importance of that resource. 
</P>
<P>
 Generations in search of alpine scenery simply walked on by some of America's 
most unique ecosystems. One of those regions would be protected by the 
California Desert Protection Act, ushered through the Senate by Sen. Dianne 
Feinstein (D-Calif.). Unsurpassed in its scenic, biological, cultural and 
recreational significance, the desert has been ignored too long. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, protection of the resource requires a sounder financial base. A first 
step would be congressional action to restore discretion to the Interior 
secretary to set reasonable park entrance fees. Currently, only three of the 
367 Park Service sites charge $10 per vehicle, only 15 charge as much as $5 per 
car and Yellowstone's entrance fee is less today than it was in 1915. In 
addition, Congress can provide collection incentives to park managers by 
returning to the park half the money collected above the current base. 
</P>
<P>
 Though beset by fundamental problems, the welcome sign is out at our national 
parks, because the National Park Service can fill a unique and immediate role. 
We are within decades of an environmental collapse on this planet. Our urgent 
task is to communicate to the American people what it means to live more 
lightly and respectfully on the land.  
</P>
<P>
 Any contemplation of our role in developing and teaching a new conservation 
ethic leads directly back to the national parks. The parks are where this task 
is easiest, where the educational process begins, where it is all so 
extraordinarily fresh, obvious and overwhelming. The national parks must serve 
as the gateway to the conservation ethic, because if that gateway can't be 
crossed in our national parks, it can't be crossed anywhere.

FOR RICHER OR FOR POORER; WE NO LONGER SCORN LIVE-IN RELATIONSHIPS, BUT WE 
STILL INVEST OUR SOCIAL, LEGAL AND ECONOMIC CAPITAL IN MARRIAGE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By MARLENE ADLER MARKS, Marlene Adler Marks is a columnist for the Jewish 
Journal of Greater Los Angeles.

 "How's your husband?" I asked a colleague the other day about the man she's 
been living with for 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's not my husband, he's my . . . companion," she replied. "I've had a 
husband. This is much better." Then she launched into an description of the 
pleasures of living together without benefit of judge or clergy, chief among 
them that, while in a committed relationship, she was not another's possession. 
</P>
<P>
 "Suit yourself," I said. "But the minute he dies or leaves you for another 
woman, you may be sorry." 
</P>
<P>
 Have we really come to terms with the contemporary meaning of husband and 
wife? With the divorce rate at 55% and lengthening life spans making serial 
monogamy more the practice than the exception, marriage may seem to make little 
sense. And yet there are signs that, as a society, we are in fact more wedded 
than ever to the institution of marriage, a steadying force on the rocky seas 
of modern life. 
</P>
<P>
 I covered the first palimony case, Marvin vs. Marvin, back in the late 1970s 
for Los Angeles magazine (though the word itself, sorry to say, is not my 
invention). I was rooting for Michelle Triola Marvin, who had lived with actor 
Lee Marvin for six years, until his attention turned. While not a feminist 
heroine, Michelle Marvin was striking a blow for women when her lawyer argued 
that a long-standing live-in relationship is rarely, as the law had it then, 
like long-term prostitution. The case established in California law that 
unmarried couples have the right to establish contracts between themselves. And 
yet she personally lost the contractual point: The $104,000 finally granted her 
was for "rehabilitation," the term often used to describe payments so an 
unemployed ex-wife can go back to school. Michelle's claim to half of 
everything was soundly rejected. 
</P>
<P>
 Fast forward now to the unhappy case of Anthony and Claire Maglica, who lived 
and worked side by side for 20 years, shared a common house and name and built 
a flashlight company into a $400-million concern. Though a jury awarded $84 
million to Claire, now 60, the case may be as much of a defeat for her as 
Michelle Marvin's was a decade and a half before. Claire Maglica's attorneys 
argued that the couple had a private agreement to share everything and that 
they presented themselves as man and wife. But the jury found no agreement, and 
its award is far less than the half interest that Claire could have claimed as 
a wife. 
</P>
<P>
 Regardless of what an appellate court eventually decides in the Maglica case, 
there are some things that we can already say about the situation of living 
together in the modern era. In the years between Marvin and Maglica, the dark 
shadow of illicit sexuality has been lifted from most live-in relationships, 
but the bias against them still hangs heavily. Although California law allows 
lovers to make contracts, it does not presume that one exists even when the 
relationship is longstanding. "Who knows what goes on behind closed doors," my 
mother used to say about couples who looked happy together. And this is the 
attitude our society has taken, too.  
</P>
<P>
 While divorces are often messy, they're a piece of cake compared with 
attempting to prove an oral agreement between parties who are no longer 
speaking to each other. Judges and juries hate to reconstruct the intent of 
relationships after affairs have fallen apart. Even if you've shared everything 
equally for years, the 50-50 nature of the commitment is far easier to prove 
for couples who have taken five minutes to say "I do" in front of witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
 This brings us to love. Although experience and evidence often justifies 
cynicism, even here in California we still reward those who make a commitment 
of the heart and declare their intentions toward each other in public. At the 
same time, we're tough on those "lovers" who live together for long periods 
without making things right. We think them foolish, or messy or somehow doomed. 
When one party disappoints the other in marriage, we call him a scoundrel, but 
without that paper we often think, how naive can you get? 
</P>
<P>
 It's funny to find in these cynical days that the allure of committed love is 
still strong. But there it is: The protections are infinitely greater, the road 
far smoother, to those who dare take the chance. To love and risk all, that's 
what husband and wife still means. To them, we are willing to grant almost 
everything: a share in each other's pension fund, insurance and Social Security 
benefits, a presumption of common purpose, the willing suspension of disbelief 
that love is here to stay. But for those who don't, we offer a lawsuit and send 
them on their way.

COMMENTARY; PACERS IN CONTROL OF EWING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE JACOBSON, NEWSDAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 They're clever people on this Pacers team. The coach shows them stuff on 
films. They didn't think they could cause Patrick Ewing to have another one of 
those clunker games. 
</P>
<P>
 So they'd have to dare those other guys in the Knickerbockers' road blue to 
beat them. 
</P>
<P>
 These are guys named Antonio Davis and Dale Davis and Rik Smits, in addition 
to Reggie Miller the household word. Who are those guys? 
</P>
<P>
 So Ewing came out Monday with all the energy he didn't have in that other game 
here. He played a fine game. And the Pacers beat the Knicks in black and blue, 
beat them at their own game. 
</P>
<P>
 And so the Pacers have now beaten the Knicks here once when Ewing had the 
worst game any superstar ever had, and once when he had a good game, and that 
should do good things in their heads. It's a perilous situation for the Knicks; 
they've lost six of seven road playoff games. A seventh game is a crapshoot 
even at home. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end it was the Pacers who were chuckling that their commotion on the 
bench caused Hubert Davis to let the Knicks' last chance go through his hands. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm upset," Ewing revealed. "Very upset." 
</P>
<P>
 With reason. The Pacers made the Knicks uncomfortable with defense, and the 
programed electronic interference in Market Square Arena. Whenever the Knicks 
had the ball there would be this automotive roar as if the Indy 500 were being 
rerun in the building. That's unpleasant and disconcerting, and condoned by the 
league. However, it was the Knicks who recreated the Brickyard with their 
shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 "We knew Patrick was not going to have a performance like that again with all 
the phone calls he got about scoring one point, and the replays he saw on CNN 
and Late Night Sports," said Lester Conner, the Pacers' sage on the end of the 
bench. "Patrick did it and not too many other guys did it for them, and that's 
a plus for us." 
</P>
<P>
 Ewing came out with whatever it is he had in his mind. Only he knows. He knows 
with John Starks blunted by his incompletely recovered knee, he is the offense. 
Ewing insisted he wasn't going to try to score 50, but then he was so juiced 
that his first shot went off the top corner of the backboard and his second 
clean over the rim. 
</P>
<P>
 "I came out wanting to have a better game," Ewing said. 
</P>
<P>
 He did. He scored 25 points, pulled down 13 rebounds. At one point when the 
Knicks were coming from behind in the third period, Ewing made a shot from the 
corner and held his hands up as if signaling touchdown. On the next sequence 
his layup rolled off the rim and he stamped his feet in a tantrum. The Knicks 
were frustrating. 
</P>
<P>
 That was all included in the Indiana plan. The Knicks' offense looks first to 
get the ball to Ewing, and Ewing looks first to score. With all those Pacers 
swarming around him, presenting a thicket for every entry pass, every shot was 
a labor. 
</P>
<P>
 No surprise. "I know they always double and triple me," Ewing said. "Just got 
to make the plays." 
</P>
<P>
 They were giving room to all those people on the outside: Dare you. "Larry 
Brown told us before the game," Conner said, "if anybody makes a couple of 
threes, don't get discouraged." 
</P>
<P>
 If the Knicks can survive this, if they can survive themselves -- and the 
series is 2-2 with the Knicks still holding the homecourt advantage -- they'll 
be bidding to be the palest offensive team ever to win the championship. Or 
something like that. 
</P>
<P>
 Can the great commissioner create an offense so heavy that even he can't lift 
it? 
</P>
<P>
 "These are the two best defensive teams in the league going at each other 
tooth and nail," Pat Riley disputed. Well, he wasn't exactly going to say what 
was on his mind as he examined the court between his shoes after the last 
chance to save the game skittered between Hubert Davis' three-point hands. 
Davis, Derek Harper, Charles Smith, Starks, Greg Anthony ... somebody has to do 
something or there'll be one Indiana Davis in front and another behind all day. 
"He -- I don't know which Davis it is -- tries to do a lot of things Bill 
Cartwright does to me," Ewing said. "He fronts me and forces me out." 
</P>
<P>
 Ewing had his admirable statistics line. However, he didn't get a rebound in 
the fourth period, when they had their last chance to win. It's hard for a man 
to rebound when he's out as far as he was looking for a shot. If the defense 
rushes him, he might throw a bad pass. 
</P>
<P>
 There were times when Ewing was a spectator, watching while the ball was being 
tapped up and tapped up under the basket. That's a limitation. But a man has to 
have more help than he got. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to keep the ball out of his hands as much as possible, make the 
other guys shoot," Dale Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think that team is going to beat you from beyond the arc," Antonio 
Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact when the Knicks made their last mistake on their last realistic chance 
to tie, Ewing was looking to shoot from beyond the three-point arc. 
</P>
<P>
 The guards don't get the ball to Ewing in the deep post often enough. Then 
again, they don't move the ball on the outside well enough to get better shots 
for themselves. "If we're moving it, we get those shots," Harper said. "We can 
make those shots." 
</P>
<P>
 That's a two-headed issue. The alternative scorers (Smith, Harper, Starks, 
Davis and Anthony) made 14 of 42 shots. Not good. They committed 12 turnovers. 
Worse. 
</P>
<P>
 Starks made a layup to bring the Knicks within 80-77 and the Knicks got the 
ball back with 28.4 seconds to tie. Starks couldn't get loose for a shot and 
neither could Harper. The ball went to Ewing at the arc. "I was going to shoot 
it," Ewing said with a shy smile. "I was behind the line; I looked." 
</P>
<P>
 He made a pump fake, Dale Davis lunged at him. Then Ewing saw Hubert Davis 
open for a three-pointer in the corner and passed. The Pacers on the bench 
noticed. They were all standing and yelling sweet nothings in Hubert's ear. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yelling anything and everything," Conner said. " 'Here it comes. Look out. 
Hurry up. Lots of time.' And, do you know, Kenny Williams had just told us, 
Hubert Davis was going to miss the pass. 
</P>
<P>
 "And you know who was closest, yelling stuff? Larry Brown." 
</P>
<P>
 It was a plan the Knicks' couldn't handle.

 After months of controversy, Russian Coach Pavel Sadyrin left four star 
players off what he said is his team's final World Cup roster. 
</P>
<P>
 The players dropped are among Russia's best -- wing Andrei Kanchelskis, and 
forwards Sergei Kiryakov, Igor Kolyvanov and Igor Shalimov. 
</P>
<P>
 They "don't exist as far as I'm concerned," Sadyrin said.

 Although a predicted boon to the San Francisco Bay area economy, World Cup 
soccer might cost Stanford as much as $1 million, school officials said.

 The school's athletic department expects to spend roughly $2.2 million to 
replace wooden benches, add media seats and build an extra fence, among other 
stadium improvements, said Valerie Veronin, who helped negotiate the World Cup 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
 Those costs and others likely will exceed revenues from parking, concessions 
and a $500,000 contribution by the World Cup Host Committee. 
</P>

 Eight other World Cup sites, run by local governments or quasi-governmental 
sports bodies, expect to profit from the games.

YIELDS RISE WITH COMMODITIES SURGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Treasury bond prices ended modestly lower Tuesday, weakened by a selloff in 
European bond markets and inflation fears renewed by soaring commodity prices. 
Blue chip stocks closed slightly higher as gains in some key shares held off 
bearish pressure from the rise in commodities prices. 
</P>
<P>
 The Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond yield rose to 7.43% from Friday's 
7.39%. Its price, which moves in the opposite direction, dropped 11/32 point, 
or about $3.44 per $1,000 in face value. 
</P>
<P>
 The Commodity Research Bureau's index of 21 commodities' prices, considered an 
indicator of future inflation, rose 4.49 points to 235.37, the highest since 
last Tuesday. The index rose because forecasts for dry weather in the Midwest 
boosted grain and soybean futures. 
</P>
<P>
 Precious metals also gained, with gold rising $2.40 an ounce on the New York 
Comex, closing at $387.10. Silver fetched $5.530, up from $5.454 on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Investors in fixed-income securities dislike inflation because it gradually 
diminishes the value of bonds, which pay set rates of interest. 
</P>
<P>
 The CRB index grabbed the spotlight from other inflation signals. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, the federal government reported that sales of new homes took an 
unexpectedly steep plunge in April. In addition, consumer confidence dropped in 
May from the upbeat levels of the previous month, according to a business 
research group. 
</P>
<P>
 But the reports gave only a modest boost to the bond market, with prices 
recovering only partially from early lows. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wall Street, stocks drifted to a mostly negative finish. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow Jones industrial average ended almost in neutral, up 1.23 at 3,758.37, 
after managing to dig out of a shallow hole in the afternoon. However, in the 
broader market, losers outnumbered gainers by about 3 to 2 on the Big Board, 
where the volume totaled 215.84 million shares. 
</P>
<P>
 Market performance measures mainly comprising New York Stock Exchange-listed 
issues closed with deficits. The NYSE composite index fell 0.55 to 252.24, and 
Standard & Poor's 500 stock index lost 0.83 to 456.50. 
</P>
<P>
 Smaller stocks had a similarly unexciting session. The Nasdaq composite index 
edged 2.05 higher to 735.19. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Tuesday's market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * The Dow industrials gained some support from Chevron, which climbed 1/2 to 
87 after Merrill Lynch & Co. raised the investment rating on the stock. 
</P>
<P>
 * One of the Big Board's most active issues was Lehman Bros., making its NYSE 
debut. It closed at 18 on its first day of trading after its spinoff from 
American Express was completed. American Express rose 1 5/8 to 27 5/8 after 
adjustment for the spinoff. 
</P>
<P>
 * One of the day's more conspicuous losers was Intermagnetics General, which 
tumbled 4 1/2 to 18 7/8 in heavy trading. An article in this week's Barrons 
said the company's fourth-quarter results will show improvement over the 
year-earlier levels but that sales have been sinking since 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 * Blockbuster Entertainment ended up 1 1/4 to 28 1/8. It was upgraded to "buy" 
from "market performer" by Robertson Stephens.  
</P>
<P>
 * McDonald's rose 1 to 62. Friday the company announced a 2-for-1 stock split 
and raised its dividend by 12%. 
</P>
<P>
 * Bombay rallied 1 1/4 to 15 7/8 after it posted a 23% rise in May sales at 
stores that have been open at least a year. 
</P>
<P>
 A respectable showing by stocks overseas, despite some heavy selling 
temporarily during the session, helped Wall Street recover from its lows of the 
day. 
</P>
<P>
 In Tokyo, the 225-issue Nikkei average rose for the third consecutive session, 
closing at 20,973.59, up 134.62 points. Frankfurt's 30-share DAX average 
finished up 9.55 points at 2,127.70, and London's Financial Times 100-share 
average rose 4.1 points to close at 2,970.5. 
</P>
<P>
 Stocks finished lower in Mexico City, with the Bolsa average losing 1.68 
points to end at 2,483.73. 
</P>
<P>
 In the currency market, the dollar rose against the yen and most major 
currencies. At the close, the dollar was quoted at 104.85 Japanese yen, up from 
104.28 yen Friday. It rose to 1.647 German marks from 1.643 marks Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar was surprisingly unaffected by the negative economic news. Lately 
the dollar has been moving in tandem with bonds, but Tuesday was an exception. 
</P>
<P>
 "The dollar didn't come off," said Dorit Ronnen, foreign exchange trader at 
the New York office of Bank Leumi Trust Co. "It was a pretty dull market." 
</P>
<P>
 Ronnen said the dollar was lower against the mark in early trading, as traders 
tested whether central bankers would intervene in support of the currency.

BOOK REVIEW / HISTORY; A SWEEPING, COMPELLING ACCOUNT OF NUREMBERG JUSTICE; 
NUREMBERG: INFAMY ON TRIAL BY JOSEPH PERSICO ; VIKING, $24.95, 496 PAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Adolf Hitler saved us the trouble by taking his own life, and so did Goebbels 
and Himmler, but the victorious Allies still faced a tough question when Nazi 
Germany surrendered in 1945: What to do with the other high-ranking Nazis -- 
Hermann Goering, Albert Speer, Rudolf Hess and a dozen or so others -- now held 
in Allied custody? 
</P>
<P>
 Put them up against a wall and shoot them, advised Winston Churchill. 
</P>
<P>
 Cooler and more calculating heads prevailed, as Joseph Persico shows us in 
"Nuremberg," and the Allies resolved to put the worst offenders among the 
leadership of the Third Reich on trial in the former Nazi shrine-city of 
Nuremberg. Now historian and biographer Joseph Persico captures both the sweep 
and the detail of the war crimes trial in an account that sometimes reads like 
a Ludlum novel. 
</P>
<P>
 The Allies were concerned -- indeed, almost obsessed -- with making a credible 
case against the Nazis before punishing them. To prevent the Nuremberg trial 
from become "a victor's spectacle" and "a high-grade lynching," as Persico puts 
it, the Allies afforded the defendants a trial with all the trappings of 
Anglo-Saxon jurisprudence. 
</P>
<P>
 But the larger purpose of the Nuremberg trial, as Persico points out, was 
moral and historical. Nuremberg was the place for fixing the crimes of the 
Third Reich in the collective memory of humankind, an opportunity to translate 
the German bureaucratic euphemisms -- "Special Action" and "Final Solution" -- 
into flesh and blood. 
</P>
<P>
 "Germany became one vast torture chamber," declared Robert Jackson, a sitting 
Supreme Court justice who took the job of chief prosecutor at President Harry 
S. Truman's request. "The cries of its victims were heard round the world and 
brought shudders to civilized people." 
</P>
<P>
 To his credit, Persico manages to compress the vast legal and political 
machinations of the Nuremberg trial -- a Gargantuan and unprecedented judicial 
exercise that produced a 42-volume transcript -- into less than 500 tight pages 
without sacrificing the colorful details or the subtle nuances. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nuremberg" evokes the quirks and foibles of the Nazis who conquered and ruled 
Europe with unspeakable cruelty. Goering, for example, is revealed to be a 
dangerously charming sociopath, a bloodstained voluptuary who showered 
expensive baubles on his jailers and insisted on sleeping in his favorite blue 
silk pajamas in an otherwise Spartan cell. Tellingly, when Goering's young 
daughter was allowed to visit him shortly before the verdict, she asked: 
"Daddy, when you come home, will you wear all your medals in the bathtub like 
everybody says you do?' 
</P>
<P>
 Persico invests a good deal of time and effort in describing the little 
scandals and the petty turf wars that raged within the legal bureaucracy of the 
International Military Tribunal. Persico suggests, for example, that prosecutor 
Jackson took advantage of the no-wives-allowed rule to conduct an affair with 
his secretary. And he gives us a play-by-play account of two American prison 
psychologists who ruthlessly competed with each other to come out with the 
first book about the Nuremberg defendants. 
</P>
<P>
 Persico also concerns himself with the fine points of the judgment at 
Nuremberg. Was it proper to hang Julius Streicher, he ponders, whose principal 
crime was the publication of a newspaper filled with anti-Semitic pornography? 
And why did the judges impose the death penalty on Fritz Sauckel, a Nazi 
functionary with a blue-collar background who conscripted slave laborers by the 
millions, and not on Speer, the cultivated technocrat who worked the slave 
laborers to death in his arms factories? 
</P>
<P>
 "In sending Sauckel to die and allowing Speer to live," Persico observes, "the 
court, consciously or unconsciously, made a class judgment." 
</P>
<P>
 Persico weighs the equities of the Nuremberg trial, and -- although he is not 
entirely pleased with the legal procedures or the specific verdicts -- he 
declares his approval of its work: "Nuremberg may have been flawed law," he 
concludes, "but it was satisfying justice." 
</P>
<P>
 Lest we forget the crimes of Nazi Germany -- and lest we entertain any doubts 
about the ample evidence of those crimes -- Persico's "Nuremberg" shows us that 
the defendants never even attempted to dispute that torture, enslavement and 
murder were conducted on a grotesque scale in concentration camps and killing 
pits all over Europe. They merely competed with each other to shift the 
responsibility for their crimes to each other or to Nazis who were conveniently 
dead. 
</P>
<P>
 And that is the single most important function of the Nuremberg war crimes 
trial and, for that matter, Persico's book: It's a pointed reminder that the 
crimes against humanity committed by the Third Reich were rigorously and 
repeatedly proven by hard evidence during the trial itself.

 "David Byrne" 
</P>
<P>
 Luaka Bop/Sire  
</P>
<P>
 Byrne's third solo album climaxes with a track called "Buck Naked," and the 
booklet features clinical close-ups of our boy in the buff. Byrne has a curious 
knack for exploring the split between biology and spirituality, how we do or 
don't feel comfortable in our own skins, how we define who we are: "I can 
barely touch my own self / How could I touch someone else? / I am just an 
advertisement for a version of myself," he confesses in "Angels." 
</P>
<P>
 Byrne suggests this is his most personal undertaking. It's certainly his most 
mature, even if many songs lack cohesion: His classic compulsions are here, but 
combined with a bigger picture, a wonderment about life (and death) expressed 
in beautiful imagery that is alternately mundane and mysterious. 
</P>
<P>
 The sound marks an intriguing return to a stripped-down band, focused on 
guitar and without the salsa horns, yet full of tricky funk and subtle 
world-beat flavorings. Even in nakedness, there's nothing terribly simple about 
Byrne or his sound. CHRIS WILLMAN New albums are rated on a scale of one star 
(poor), two stars (fair), three stars (good) and four stars (excellent).

MOVIE REVIEW; 'THE BLUE KITE': AN HONEST, POWERFUL CHINESE SAGA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH TURAN, TIMES FILM CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Of all the remarkable films to have come out of China over the past few years, 
"The Blue Kite" could well be the most authentic, the most accessible and, 
finally, the most powerful. Daring politically and quietly shattering 
emotionally, it tells the truth in such a completely human way that it hardly 
seems foreign at all. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the work of fellow Fifth Generation filmmakers Chen Kiage ("Farewell My 
Concubine") and Zhang Yimou ("Raise the Red Lantern"), there is nothing 
theatrical or operatic about this film from director Tian Zhuangzhuang. A 
welcoming naturalism characterizes his style here, an ability to see great 
events through the lives of ordinary people caught unawares in the toils of 
history that is immediately involving. 
</P>
<P>
 Set between the death of Stalin in 1953 and the living death of 1968's 
Cultural Revolution, Xiao Mao's realistic script illuminates that most chaotic 
period of modern Chinese politics by telling the story of an ordinary woman 
named Chen Shujuan (popular Chinese actress Lu Liping) and her extended family. 
</P>
<P>
 Simple as it is, this idea did not find favor with the powers who run China's 
film industry. After viewing a rough cut of "The Blue Kite," they forbade 
shipping the footage to Japan (where most Chinese films go for 
post-production). The film was spirited out anyway, edited according to the 
director's detailed notes, and shown to great praise both at Cannes and the 
Tokyo Film Festival, where the Chinese delegation walked out during the 
screening and later announced plans to sue the Dutch company that had acquired 
the world rights. 
</P>
<P>
 It may seem unusual for such a quiet film to have stirred up such a 
considerable fuss, but it is just the discretion and restraint with which "The 
Blue Kite" was created that makes its points so effective and its indictment of 
China's past political situation so damning. 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly when we first meet Shujuan, everything seems happy and hopeful. Much 
to the delight of her idealistic sister (Song Xiaoying) and her brothers (Zhong 
Ping and Chu Quanzhong), she is about to marry librarian Lin Shaolong (Pu 
Quanxin) and move into a small apartment in a bustling Beijing courtyard. Soon 
a son, called Tietou or "Iron Head," is born and, true to his nickname, he 
grows up to be the film's stubborn narrator. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the action of "The Blue Kite" takes place in that busy courtyard and 
among the members of that family. Director Tian is a thoughtful, nuanced 
observer, and, helped by Hou Yong's sensitive camerawork, he gets a great deal 
of poignancy out of intimate family scenes between brother and sister, mother 
and child, husband and wife. 
</P>
<P>
 These moments play out against the turmoil caused by the topsy-turvy political 
movements of the day. First came Rectification, a call from the Communist Party 
for honesty and criticism, followed almost immediately by an Anti-Rightist 
campaign that condemned those who did speak out. Next was the Great Leap 
Forward, a frantic attempt to increase China's industrial production, which led 
finally to the mad terror of the Cultural Revolution. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Blue Kite" is especially good at showing how difficult it was for 
ordinary people to try to find space to just survive as the baffling crosswinds 
of politics caused the loss of jobs, relationships, even lives. "The more I 
think about it," Shujuan says at one point, more in resignation than in anger, 
"the less I understand." 
</P>
<P>
 This kind of rigorous, unforgiving look at a major span of Chinese history, a 
willingness to take on political movements that are still off-limits to 
criticism, is one of the things that got "The Blue Kite" in such trouble with 
the authorities. The other taboo, apparently never before addressed on film, is 
official insistence that attractive women in the army eschew steady boyfriends 
and instead provide escort services for powerful party leaders as "political 
duties." 
</P>
<P>
 The only token of hope in this troubled time is the kite of the film's title. 
A fragile paper object that keeps getting destroyed or lost and then rebuilt, 
it symbolizes freedom, beauty, innocence and the hope of escape, all the things 
that that generation of Chinese, as this film so carefully shows, had to live 
their lives without.

TV REVIEW; TONY TONY TONY, UNPLUGGED AS ALWAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD CROMELIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Tony Bennett in his natural state is always unplugged, at least by the 
standards of the MTV generation that's lately adopted him as a swinging father 
figure. 
</P>
<P>
 That means the latest edition of "MTV Unplugged" is pretty much business as 
usual for the veteran song stylist, without the shifting of musical gears that 
gives the acoustic showcase its reason for being. 
</P>
<P>
 The exception is on "Fly Me to the Moon," where Bennett literally unplugs the 
microphones and proceeds to wail with remarkable power. 
</P>
<P>
 Other than that, it's largely smooth and safe sailing through the classic 
American pop songbook, a fine if familiar performance with Bennett in perfect 
sync with his longtime accompanists, the Ralph Sharon Trio. 
</P>
<P>
 To juice it up, the show brings out two duet partners -- Elvis Costello 
(introduced by Bennett as "my buddy from Britain") and k.d. lang (introduced as 
a peer of Billie Holiday, Edith Piaf and Hank Williams -- get a grip, Tony!). 
</P>
<P>
 Lang's liquid tones form an intriguing contrast with the star's rough-textured 
voice on "Moonglow," but there's less rapport in the Costello teaming on a 
version of "They Can't Take That Away From Me" marked by halting interplay. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision to include these two "adult" artists and leave less congruent 
guest spots by the Lemonheads' Evan Dando and Dinosaur Jr.'s J Mascis on the 
cutting-room floor gives the hour more of a VH-1 than an MTV personality. File 
under missed opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Tony Bennett Unplugged" airs at 10 tonight on MTV, repeating on Sunday at 9

THEATER REVIEW; 'TOM AND JERRY' A TREAT AT ONE-ACT FESTIVAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By F. KATHLEEN FOLEY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Act One -- Evening B," the second installment in a festival of original 
one-act plays sponsored by Showtime, continues to prove entertaining and 
provoking. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tom and Jerry," the best play so far in the series, is a comedy of the 
darkest hue that centers around the business-as-usual relationship of two mob 
hit-men. These matter-of-fact monsters view themselves as regular joes just 
doing a job -- except in their case, instead of exchanging gossip around the 
office water cooler, they swap yarns over a buzzing chain saw while preparing 
to dismember their latest victim. 
</P>
<P>
 Playwright Rick Cleveland has lifted his comically vicious characters straight 
out of an old Hanna-Barbera cartoon and placed them in a hyper-real, 
psychically numbing universe in which the medium is the massacre. 
</P>
<P>
 In their respective roles as Tom and Jerry, Sam McMurray and Bruce MacVittie 
use sure-fire timing with lethal effect. McMurray's mellow avuncularity 
contrasts perfectly with MacVittie's garrote-taut nerviness. Dan Castellaneta 
(known popularly as the voice of Homer Simpson) portrays all the other 
characters with dead-eyed panache. Director Saul Rubinek's dispassionate, 
throwaway style subtly underlines the horror. 
</P>
<P>
 While not quite as gush-worthy, the evening's opener, "Lynette at 3 A.M.," by 
Jane Anderson, is an amusing hors d'oeuvre about a young woman who, while in 
bed with her boyfriend, is visited by an amorous spirit en route to the 
hereafter. 
</P>
<P>
 Anne O'Sullivan, Pat Skipper and Yul Vazquez milk the moments in this 
paranormal love triangle, and Anderson, a past master at juxtaposing the 
mundane with the extraordinary, has given her own work an optimum staging. 
</P>
<P>
 "A Death in Bethany," by Garry Williams, is a visceral drama about a man 
arduously freeing himself from the emotional legacy of his neglectful father. 
David Packer plays a man in meltdown, whose relationship with his 
long-suffering wife, played by Kellie Overbey, has reached critical mass. 
</P>
<P>
 The second act opens with "Iron Tommy," James Ryan's comedy about a 
male-bonding group, in which the bondees beat drums, roar like lions, weep 
wrenchingly and search for their inner men-children. Satisfyingly silly and 
often hilarious, Ryan's play flags with the arrival of (what else?) an 
eye-poppingly beautiful young woman who sets the boys a-slobberin'. 
</P>
<P>
 The evening's closer, Wil Calhoun's "Call It Clover," is a steamy character 
piece set in New Orleans that examines the nature of dreams and diminishing 
expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 Risa Bramon Garcia directs her actors well, although the sorghum-thick 
Louisiana dialect occasionally clogs up performances. Arliss Howard is 
endearing as the puppy-cute Eddie, an antithetical redneck whose geniality and 
humanity form the crux of the play. Unfortunately, when Calhoun metaphorically 
whips the puppy in a contrived ending, the audience feels emotionally 
manipulated.

 MORMON PROPHET: The father of longtime Ventura County Judge John J. Hunter is 
expected to become the next president-prophet of the Mormon Church. . . . With 
this week's passing of Mormon leader Ezra Taft Benson, the normal succession 
would move Elder Howard W. Hunter into the presidency of the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints. "I talked to him last night and asked him how he 
felt," Judge Hunter said. "He said he felt the weight of the responsibility." 
The Mormon Church has nearly 9 million members.

 TO BOLDLY GO: When it comes to local companies landing jobs on foreign soil, 
Xsirius' latest contract is out of this world. . . . The Camarillo company will 
provide NASA with X-ray technology to analyze the surface of Mars. The 
instrument will be mounted on a remote-control vehicle roving the planet in 
1996. Xsirius Chief Operating Officer Mark Ramsaier said the concept is similar 
to looking at a white shirt under a black light. "You excite a material with 
gamma rays and then look at its X-ray fluorescence to determine its elements."

 TOOL TIME: Lemon rancher Bob Pfeiler knew he struck pay dirt when he found the 
crusty wooden carcass of a horse-drawn water wagon stuck in the mud (B1). . . . 
It was one of several antique farm implements the Oxnard octogenarian 
discovered remarkably well-preserved on Pine Mountain. "They are priceless, 
absolutely priceless," Pfeiler said. They've also become the latest items in a 
collection he hopes will become the county's Farm Implements Museum. 
</P>
<P>
 TOXIC SHOCK: How about bay leaves and cucumber skins to ward off roaches? Or 
buttermilk and molasses to catch flies? Or eucalyptus and rosemary to deter 
fleas? These are a few of the environmentally friendly ways that a 
county-issued booklet suggests to control 10 common pests. . . . The booklet, 
"Indoor Pest Control," aims to reduce the toxic waste that must be disposed 
yearly. But do they work? Some suggestions carry the disclaimer: "not 
scientifically proven."

MCLEAN HOLDS OFF RANGERS; STANLEY CUP FINALS: CANUCK GOALTENDER MAKES 52 SAVES 
IN 3-2 OVERTIME VICTORY IN GAME 1. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HELENE ELLIOTT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 He stopped shots singly and in rapid succession in a sensational goaltending 
display that was one for the ages, if not for the faint of heart. 
</P>
<P>
 Kirk McLean made 52 saves Tuesday, the most in the Stanley Cup finals since 
1971, thrusting out an arm or a leg with acrobatic grace to keep his Vancouver 
Canucks in a game the New York Rangers threatened to claim early. Yet, it was a 
shot that got by McLean and careened off the crossbar that allowed the Canucks 
to grab a thrilling 3-2 overtime victory from the Rangers at Madison Square 
Garden in the opener of the Stanley Cup finals. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rangers had pelted McLean with 37 shots in regulation play and 17 shots in 
the extra period, none seemingly as dangerous as Brian Leetch's wide-open, 
15-foot shot with 41 seconds left in overtime. As the crowd roared, Leetch put 
his body into the shot -- and was knocked to the ice before he could see it hit 
metal instead of net. 
</P>
<P>
 "He shoots it with the best of them," McLean said. "We got a good bounce." 
</P>
<P>
 The puck bounced past Ranger defenseman Jeff Beukeboom, who was deep in the 
offensive zone, and onto the stick of Vancouver's Pavel Bure. Seeing several 
Rangers caught in the zone, Bure made a quick pass to Cliff Ronning, creating a 
two-on-one break for Ronning and Adams with only Ranger forward Esa Tikkanen to 
beat. 
</P>
<P>
 Ronning skated up the left side and Adams the right. Ranger goalie Mike 
Richter came out of his net to play the angle and faced Ronning, leaving Adams 
the right side of the net. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I saw (Tikkanen) go to Cliff, I knew I was going to shoot," Adams said. 
"As soon as I got it, I one-timed it. It fluttered on me a little bit, but I 
did hit it pretty hard, enough to get by him." 
</P>
<P>
 It got by Richter with 34 seconds left in overtime, stunning the crowd and 
causing the Rangers to wonder how to beat McLean. 
</P>
<P>
 They took long shots and close shots, including three consecutive point-blank 
tries early in overtime by Tikkanen, Steve Larmer and Stephane Matteau. Nothing 
rattled McLean, who had been 0-7-2 in his career against the Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Vancouver walked out of here with a win tonight because of their goaltending, 
period," Ranger Coach Mike Keenan said. "McLean is the reason they're here to 
begin with. If you're really honest about it, beginning with their 
(first-round) Calgary series, he has had the best series of games for a 
goaltender this spring, no question." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Vancouver Coach Pat Quinn: "He was the story. That was a game that has to 
go in the highlight package for us and maybe an instructional film for young 
goaltenders." 
</P>
<P>
 The Canucks, who are 6-1 in overtime in the playoffs, pulled even in the last 
minute of the third period on a goal by former King first-round draft pick 
Martin Gelinas. That late drama was a familiar scenario to the Rangers, who 
gave up the tying goal to the New Jersey Devils with 7.7 seconds to play in the 
seventh game of their Eastern Conference final series. They persevered to beat 
the Devils in double overtime but were stymied by McLean. 
</P>
<P>
 "You want to get into the game right away with some nice shots, not 
point-blank, but coming down the wing, angle shots, shots you can get your body 
in front of and you don't have to move much right away," McLean said. "For the 
most part, we've been doing that." 
</P>
<P>
 Larmer's rebound of an Alexei Kovalev shot at 3:32 of the first period was the 
only goal until 5:45 of the third. That's when Bret Hedican dashed into the 
high slot for a quick wrist shot that tied the game, his first goal in 86 
regular-season and playoff games this season. Hedican, a 1992 U.S. Olympian, 
had one other career goal, scored into an empty net in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rangers seemed as deflated as their fans when Hedican scored on the 
rebound of Jyrki Lumme's skidding, off-balance shot. But they regained the lead 
at 8:29, on a dazzling rush by Leetch. He cut from the right wing to the middle 
of the ice and faked a shot as he sped up the right side. That drew a host of 
Canucks toward him, and he found Kovalev open in the left circle and Kovalev 
snapped it past a helpless McLean for his sixth postseason goal. 
</P>
<P>
 Gelinas, whom the Kings traded to Edmonton in the Wayne Gretzky deal, sent the 
game into overtime when he poked a centering pass by Ronning between Richter's 
left arm and the post. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither team was happy with its performance and vowed to improve in Game 2, 
which will be Thursday at the Garden. It's imperative for the Rangers. "We 
can't afford to go down, 2-0," Leetch said. "This was a tough loss, to give up 
a goal toward the end of regulation and lose in overtime, but we can't dwell on 
it. We worked hard and did a lot of good things." 
</P>
<P>
 Hockey Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Since the finals went to a best-of-seven format, the Game 1 winner has won the 
Cup 44 of 55 times (80%). . . . Pavel Bure extended his point-scoring streak to 
16 games. He has 13 goals and 23 points in that span. The playoff record is 18, 
set by the Islanders' Bryan Trottier in 1981. . . . The Rangers had 52 
victories this season, not 54 as stated in Tuesday's editions.

ROCKETS NOW REST AND WAIT; PRO BASKETBALL: HOUSTON CONTROLS GAME EARLY AND 
WRAPS UP SERIES WITH A 94-83 VICTORY OVER JAZZ. NBA FINALS NEXT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 No, the local clock operator didn't blow the final buzzer 10 seconds into the 
game with the Rockets up, 2-0. 
</P>
<P>
 He did something worse to get even for that frozen moment in Salt Lake City, 
he made the Utah Jazz players go all 48 minutes Tuesday night. In that time, 
the Rockets went up by 26 points, let the visitors make the usual late run and 
then broke their hearts for good, winning, 94-83, to take the Western 
Conference finals, 4-1. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rockets now will have seven days off while New York and Indiana, tied 2-2, 
decide the East. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't care who wins," Rocket forward Robert Horry said. "I just want them 
to go seven games and beat each other up." 
</P>
<P>
 Everything else has worked out for the Rockets. The Jazz was all but served up 
on a platter, arriving after a seven-game series with the Denver Nuggets in 
which it almost blew a 3-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Counting this series, the Jazz completed a 2-7 finish. 
</P>
<P>
 From the opening game of this series, Jazz players and coaches hinted that 
they really thought they were in over their heads. Even their 
harder-than-hard-nosed coach, Jerry Sloan, said that if his players couldn't 
step up in Game 5, "Maybe we weren't the best team." 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe they weren't. Instead of stepping up, they were stepped on. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rockets hit them with a fearsome assault, making nine of their first 11 
shots, including all four of the three-pointers they tried, three by the king 
of the streak shooters, Vernon Maxwell. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rockets led by 13 points after one quarter, 18 at the half, 26 late in the 
third. 
</P>
<P>
 "They just came out and took us away from everything we wanted to do," Sloan 
said. "It looked like we just wanted to get the game over. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know how you could be tired at this point. It's beyond my 
imagination, to play this long and this hard. If you are, you're not taking 
care of yourself. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just didn't have any toughness. . . . Any time we tried to do something, 
they moved us out of the position we were in. I don't think you have any chance 
to win if you don't put up a better fight than that." 
</P>
<P>
 Playing the Rockets, however, means always having a chance. 
</P>
<P>
 Houston blew an 18-point lead and Game 1 of the previous series to the Suns. 
The Rockets set a record in the next game by losing after blowing a 20-point 
lead in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Rudy Tomjanovich insisted his players had learned their lesson. At 
halftime Tuesday, he promised NBC's Hannah Storm they would be all right. . . . 
after which they did it again. 
</P>
<P>
 Leading by 79-53 late in the third quarter, the Rockets watched the Jazz go on 
a 22-4 run that cut their lead to eight points. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, as panic gripped the Summit, the Jazz faded away. 
</P>
<P>
 Karl Malone threw a hook pass to no one. 
</P>
<P>
 Rookie forward Bryon Russell, a No. 2 draft choice from Long Beach State, 
tried a running seven-footer and Horry blocked it. 
</P>
<P>
 The 6-10 Horry fell, landed on his hip and rolled over in pain but stayed in 
the game after a timeout. Moments later he took a pass from double-teamed 
Hakeem Olajuwon and threw down a two-handed dunk that almost took the Mailman's 
head off. 
</P>
<P>
 The Jazz went down the stretch without its one hot shooter, Jeff Hornacek, 
injured in a collision with Olajuwon with 5:54 left. 
</P>
<P>
 "Either his nose is broken," Sloan said, grinning, "or his ears got turned 
inside out." 
</P>
<P>
 Tomjanovich said later he wanted to put the first quarter "in the vault." 
</P>
<P>
 And the fourth? 
</P>
<P>
 "In the toilet," he said laughing. 
</P>
<P>
 Call it another Rocket lesson for the Rocket scientists.

SUTCLIFFE MAKES MOST OF SPECIAL HOMECOMING, 6-0 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARYANN HUDSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On the plane flight to the West Coast, Rick Sutcliffe listened to an old tape, 
one that he has kept since his first start as a Dodger in 1979. He put on the 
headset and listened to Dodger broadcaster Vin Scully calling the play-by-play 
of his first success as a rookie.  
</P>
<P>
 Fifteen seasons later, Sutcliffe, former Dodger, NL rookie of the year and Cy 
Young Award winner, held the Dodgers scoreless for 7 2/3 innings as the St. 
Louis Cardinals scored a 6-0 victory before 36,689 at Dodger Stadium.  
</P>
<P>
 "It was really important for me to win here today because this is where it all 
began for me, " Sutcliffe said. "I didn't want to embarrass myself out here." 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Piazza, who is batting .340, got two of the seven hits against Sutcliffe 
(2-1), who made his second start since being sidelined because of a strained 
left hamstring. It was his best start since he faced the Dodgers April 13 in 
St. Louis -- his first NL start since 1991 -- and he won that game, too. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never know what to expect from Rick," St. Louis Manager Joe Torre said. 
"He'll drive you mad at times, but he never gives up on a hitter." 
</P>
<P>
 The Dodgers had their opportunities, leaving the bases loaded with two out in 
the second inning and runners on first and second with one out in the fourth. 
But Sutcliffe, with the help of a fine play by shortstop Ozzie Smith in the 
fifth, retired eight of nine batters until the eighth inning, when the Dodgers 
loaded the bases with two out and failed to score again.  
</P>
<P>
 "Ozzie is like having five infielders out there," Sutcliffe said. "It's 
probably the best (defense) I have played with. If I keep it in the park, I 
know I have a chance." 
</P>
<P>
 In the eighth, Jose Offerman beat out an infield single, Piazza singled to 
right and Tim Wallach walked, loading the bases for Henry Rodriguez. That was 
it for Sutcliffe, who was relieved by right-hander Rene Arocha. But Rodriguez 
grounded to third to end the inning. 
</P>
<P>
 "He didn't throw too many strikes, but he got us swinging at his pitches," 
Eric Karros said. "If we would have just gone up there and stood there, he 
would have walked us." 
</P>
<P>
 Against starter Tom Candiotti (4-2), the Cardinals scored twice in the second, 
one run the result of a throwing error by Wallach, twice in the third on a 
two-run double by Tom Pagnozzi, and made it 6-0 in the eighth on a two-run 
double by Bernard Gilkey.  
</P>
<P>
 The loss was the Dodgers' fifth in eight games during this home stand, but 
they are still in first place in the National League West, three games ahead of 
the San Francisco Giants. After 52 games last season, the Dodgers had a 28-24 
record -- the same as this season -- but were five games behind the San 
Francisco Giants, tied for third place with the Atlanta Braves in the National 
League West. The Houston Astros were in second. 
</P>
<P>
 This season, the Braves lead the NL East and the Astros are tied with 
Cincinnati for the lead in the NL Central. But with the same record as last 
season, the Dodgers are on top in the West, and have been since May 16. With 
the Giants struggling, the Dodgers have blown several chances to increase their 
lead dramatically.  
</P>
<P>
 But same record or not, this season is a lot more fun. 
</P>
<P>
 "The last two seasons were miserable," center fielder Brett Butler said. "When 
you are not winning and there is division on the team, you still try your 
hardest, but it isn't fun.  
</P>
<P>
 "But this season there are guys here at 2:30 in the afternoon to get extra 
hitting in. There are 25 guys working together." 
</P>
<P>
 Piazza, who has driven in 24 runs in his last 25 games, said he is enjoying 
himself more this season than last, when he became the center of attention en 
route to his rookie of the year award. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have been able to relax more, it isn't so much of an adrenaline rush," said 
Piazza, who ranks in the top 10 in the league in batting average, hits and 
RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last season it was like I blinked and the season was over."

SLAM DREAM IS SLAMMED BY COURIER; FRENCH OPEN: SAMPRAS, SEEKING TO WIN FOURTH 
CONSECUTIVE GRAND SLAM EVENT, LOSES IN QUARTERFINALS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Pete Sampras' quest to make tennis history was laid to rest Tuesday on the 
parched red clay of Roland Garros Stadium, where the harder the world's 
top-ranked player hit the ball, the harder he fell. 
</P>
<P>
 Attempting to become the first man in 25 years to win four consecutive Grand 
Slam tournaments, Sampras misplayed the big points in a 6-4, 5-7, 6-4, 6-4 loss 
to Jim Courier in the quarterfinals of the French Open. 
</P>
<P>
 In a repeat of last year's five-set final, Courier will play Sergi Bruguera of 
Spain in Friday's semifinals. The sixth-seeded Bruguera, who has yet to lose a 
set, rolled past No. 4 Andrei Medvedev of Ukraine, 6-3, 6-2, 7-5, in the 
quarterfinals. Courier has a 4-1 record against Bruguera, the only loss coming 
here in last year's title match. 
</P>
<P>
 Courier's record against Sampras had been dismal. 
</P>
<P>
 With a chance to join Don Budge and Rod Laver as the only men to hold all the 
major titles simultaneously, Sampras was hoping for a breakthrough this week 
after losing in the quarterfinals here the previous two years. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, he lost for the first time in 26 Grand Slam matches, giving a 
performance that if not quite lackluster, was definitely lacking. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm kind of down and disappointed," Sampras said. "To win four in a row would 
have been something that would have been written about for years." 
</P>
<P>
 Courier, who had not defeated Sampras in 18 months, arrived on Center Court 
displaying the same dogged determination that had earned him French Open titles 
in 1991 and '92. And he could not have been more pleased when Sampras played 
tentatively, content to stand on the baseline and bang away. 
</P>
<P>
 Big mistake. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Sampras is capable of powerful ground strokes, he is less effective 
on the clay than Courier. 
</P>
<P>
 Both players agreed that the surface made a difference, although the first 
summer-like weather in nine days of action made the courts quicker, which could 
have allowed Sampras to use his devastating serve-and-volley game. 
</P>
<P>
 But with his first serve deserting him, Sampras tried to compensate with big 
forehands, and that's Courier's forte. "I was in a lot more rallies and I was 
able to be the dictator rather than being the person dictated to," Courier 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Sampras had lost only twice this year, he was not necessarily the 
favorite. Courier has a 25-1 record at Roland Garros since 1991 and is on 
course to reach the final for the fourth consecutive year. 
</P>
<P>
 His play against Sampras could be one of those moments that turns a player's 
career. Once the world's No. 1 player, Courier has struggled for the past year 
as his intensity dropped along with his interest. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's certainly a good one for my head," Courier said. "It has been a long 
time since I have won a big match in a big tournament like this against a top 
player." 
</P>
<P>
 Although neither player could find a comfortable rhythm at the start, Courier 
looked the more confident. And Sampras seemed to spend more time fidgeting with 
his rackets than trying to find a way to solve his opponent's shots. 
</P>
<P>
 Sampras had seven new rackets for the match, and because of the warm weather, 
the string tension was soft. So, Sampras kept sending the rackets to the locker 
room to have the tension adjusted. 
</P>
<P>
 It was not racket tension that kept the match close, however. Sampras seemed 
to gain confidence by saving two break points that would have given Courier a 
4-1 lead in the second set. Sampras broke service for the first time in the 
next game when Courier double-faulted and suddenly took command by tying the 
score. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the third set, his timidity returned. Then the match seemed to turn on 
the ninth game. Sampras took a 40-15 lead before Courier fought back. When 
Sampras double-faulted on game point, Courier saw an opening. He won the game 
on the second break point when Sampras hit a half-volley into the net, then 
served out the set with an ace on set point. 
</P>
<P>
 Sampras was not through, however. He started hitting the ball more crisply in 
the fourth set and looked as if he would rally. But in the seventh game, with 
Sampras serving to go ahead, 4-3, he double-faulted on game point again. 
Sampras saved three break points but hit a forehand long on the fourth and was 
broken. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we were to do it all over again, I'd come in more, play serve-and-volley 
more," Sampras said. "The clay limited my serve and helped his forehand. . . . 
But I can win here one year. I really believe that."

NEWSWIRE: KRZYZEWSKI DECIDES TO REMAIN AT DUKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Staff and Wire Reports

<TEXT>
<P>
 Mike Krzyzewski resisted the lure of the NBA Tuesday when he announced that he 
would remain Duke's basketball coach. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very comfortable and happy at this level -- that doesn't mean one level 
was lower or higher," Krzyzewski said at a news conference that was broadcast 
live on radio across North Carolina and on many television stations. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a lot of respect for the talent level, the coaching level and how they 
handle everything in the NBA," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus ended a week of speculation centered on recent meetings between 
Krzyzewski and NBA officials. Krzyzewski reportedly could have his pick of jobs 
in Portland, Miami, New Jersey and with the Clippers. 
</P>
<P>
 "There has never been a concrete offer from a specific team," he said. "I 
talked to a lot of NBA people in the last couple of weeks, but not all of it 
was about me." 
</P>
<P>
 Krzyzewski coached Duke to successive national championships in 1991 and '92, 
and brought them to the '94 championship game against Arkansas. But he was 
reportedly unhappy with a lack of access to professors to find out how his 
players were doing in class. A trip to Australia was recently canceled because 
some players were struggling through the spring semester.

 The NCAA has discovered numerous violations in Coastal Carolina's basketball 
program, including paid plane tickets for athletes and their parents and phony 
course work approved by coaches. Coastal, the 1993 Big South Conference 
champion, forfeited 14 games and removed itself from this season's league 
tournament in hopes that the NCAA will show mercy.

 Minnesota Timberwolves co-owner Harvey Ratner indicated Tuesday that the

 Ratner and co-owner Marv Wolfenson announced last week that they had sold the 
team to a New Orleans group for $152.5 million. Since then, a Minnesota group 
led by Gov. Arne Carlson has been scrambling to put together a package to keep 
the team in Minneapolis.

 After months of controversy, Russian Coach Pavel Sadyrin left four star

<P>
 The players dropped are among Russia's best -- wing Andrei Kanchelskis and 
forwards Sergei Kiryakov, Igor Kolyvanov and Igor Shalimov. 
</P>
<P>
 The four are the final holdouts from a mutiny launched by many of the team's 
veteran players in December. They demanded that Sadyrin be fired.

ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD

<TEXT>
<P>
 No wonder Mike Krzyzewski is remaining at Duke instead of going to the NBA. . 
. . 
</P>
<P>
 He likes coaching good shooters. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Some of the same people who think the NCAA three-point shot line should be 
brought out believe the NBA line should be brought in. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The question isn't why the Houston Astros released Mitch (Wild Thing) 
Williams, but why they ever acquired him. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Now that Paul O'Neill's batting average has dipped below .450, George 
Steinbrenner probably will put him on the trading block. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 I wonder if the wave will be performed at the three tenors' concert next month 
at Dodger Stadium. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The Dodgers, who need relief, might eventually call up Rudy Seanez, who is 
pitching well at Albuquerque. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "Raul Mondesi swings at too many bad pitches," Al Campanis said. "But of 
course, he's just a kid.". . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Campanis remembers another young outfielder, Duke Snider, who had the same 
problem. The Brooklyn Dodgers made him spend hours in the batting cage without 
swinging at a pitch. Snider would yell 
</P>
<P>
 whether he thought the pitch was a ball or a strike, and an umpire standing 
behind the cage would also make a call. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Baseball crowds are as sensitive as batters -- they boo when a pitch is a few 
inches inside and chin high. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The Angels are one of the few teams that have a better record on the road than 
at home. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Consider yourself a baseball fanatic if you watched all 4 hours 23 minutes of 
Detroit's 11-inning 5-3 victory over Baltimore on ESPN Monday. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 It lasted as long as some of the doubleheaders that used to be played on 
Memorial Day. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Don Drysdale would have liked Darren Dreifort. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Unbalanced schedules -- i.e., more intra-division games -- are a must next 
season. That is the surest way to avoid the possibility of a team with a losing 
record winning a division. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Fitting the description of a roller-coaster career is Andres Galarraga's. . . 
.  
</P>
<P>
 Joe Torre is a good manager, but he was an even better TV commentator. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Ivy League dominated a sport this year. Princeton won both the NCAA 
Division I men's and women's lacrosse titles. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the greatest lacrosse player ever is Jim Brown, who also played some 
football for Syracuse. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 I guess letting Anna Kournikova, 12, compete in the French Open was OK, as 
long as it was in the junior division. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The bad part is that Kournikova will be eligible to join the women's tour the 
month of her 14th birthday. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Roberto Duran, who will turn 43 on June 16, probably still has enough to beat 
Vinny Pazienza on June 25 at the MGM Grand Garden. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The Nevada State Athletic Commission has turned down a proposal to install 
open scoring, which would have made officials' cards public after each round. . 
. .  
</P>
<P>
 The trouble with the new National Best Seven bet is that there isn't enough 
time between races. Sorry, just kidding. . . 
</P>
<P>
 Holy Bull should have run in the Preakness. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Arcangues might be better on dirt than grass. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Grand Flotilla's winning purse in the Hollywood Turf Handicap Sunday was 
$275,000, meaning trainer Jenine Sahadi earned $27,500. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 A 2-year-old full brother to two-time champion grass mare Flawlessly was 
shipped from Florida to Charlie Whittingham's barn at Hollywood Park recently. 
His name is Perfect. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The top three men and women finishers in the Mazda-Orange County Performing 
Arts Center Triathlon on Sunday will qualify for the U.S. team in the Goodwill 
Games. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Dave Scott, 40, six-time Ironman Triathlon champion, will attempt a comeback 
after a three-year retirement. . . .

 "Hardwood Dreams," a chronicle of Morningside High's 1992-93 basketball season 
that is narrated by Wesley Snipes, will be shown on June 9 at 7 p.m. and 9:30

 A crowd of 70,000 is expected for the U.S.-Mexico soccer game Saturday at the 
Rose Bowl. . . .

DIVISION V BASEBALL; CALVARY CHAPEL'S ROSTER OF UPSETS INCLUDES BIG BEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE KRESAL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Calvary Chapel, which already had beaten the top-seeded team in the Southern 
Section Division V baseball playoffs, added the defending champion to its upset 
list. 
</P>
<P>
 The Eagles scored on an error in the bottom of the 10th inning to beat Big 
Bear, 3-2, Tuesday in a semifinal game at Orange Coast College. 
</P>
<P>
 Calvary Chapel, the third-place team from the Olympic League, advances to play 
Sierra Madre Maranatha in the final at 2 p.m. Saturday at Blair Field in Long 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 The Eagles upset No. 1-seeded Los Angeles Baptist, 4-0, in the second round, 
then beat Cambria Coast Union, 8-5, in the quarterfinals Friday. Big Bear won 
the Division V title last season. 
</P>
<P>
 Calvary Chapel (20-8) got an outstanding pitching performance from senior 
right-hander J.J. Sandkamp (10-2). Sandkamp, who has all four Eagle playoff 
victories, gave up eight hits and two runs, both unearned. He also had nine 
strikeouts. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Sandkamp) pitched very, very well," Calvary Chapel Coach Joe Walters said. 
"There is no doubt that he's the top pitcher in the division." 
</P>
<P>
 As Sandkamp was dominating Big Bear, Calvary Chapel kept frustrating its fans 
with failed scoring opportunities -- until the 10th. 
</P>
<P>
 Ryan Blood was hit by a pitch to start the inning. He went to second when Joe 
Jones walked on a full count. Jones fouled off four pitches with the count full 
before taking an off-speed pitch that was inside. 
</P>
<P>
 Alex Okland then came up in an obvious sacrifice situation. He bunted toward 
third base and Big Bear catcher Jack Iafrate came out to get it. 
</P>
<P>
 Iafrate's throw toward first went past second baseman Mike Brisson, who was 
covering first, and into right field, allowing Blood to score the winning run. 
Okland would have beat the throw. 
</P>
<P>
 The Eagles had chances to score in the eighth and ninth, but failed. Jones 
walked to start the eighth, went to second on a wild pitch and reached third on 
Okland's infield single. 
</P>
<P>
 But Sandkamp struck out and Jones was out when an attempted squeeze failed. 
Chance King struck out to end the inning. 
</P>
<P>
 Calvary Chapel had runners on first and second in the ninth with two outs but 
Jerry Quenzler was picked off second to end the threat. 
</P>
<P>
 Calvary Chapel had a chance to open a big lead in the fourth. They had a run 
in, the bases loaded and one out but failed to score again. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt like we could have won it about three times," Walters said. "But these 
guys never get down. They just keep coming back."

DIVISION III BASEBALL; COMBS' TIMELY PERFORMANCE SENDS LA QUINTA TO ANOTHER 
FINAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JASON H. REID, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Practice was winding down early this season when La Quinta Coach Dave Demarest 
pulled senior pitcher Steve Combs aside and broke the bad news. 
</P>
<P>
 Combs had finished second to sophomore Joe Garcia in a two-way battle for No. 
2 in the Aztecs' rotation. The second starter on La Quinta's Southern Section 
Division III runner-up last season, Combs all of sudden found himself facing 
lots of bench time and, he thought, a wasted final season. 
</P>
<P>
 Sensing he needed a lift, Demarest encouraged Combs to keep his head high 
because the Aztecs would need him to deliver down the road. 
</P>
<P>
 Combs' patience finally paid off. 
</P>
<P>
 His clutch hitting and relief pitching sparked La Quinta, which rallied for a 
4-3 victory Tuesday over Corona in the Division III baseball semifinals at 
Norco High. 
</P>
<P>
 Combs' two-strike, two-out, pinch-hit double to right field drove in the tying 
run for La Quinta in the top of the seventh inning. The Aztecs took their only 
lead one batter later when Panther pitcher Mike Darr gave up the winning run on 
a balk. 
</P>
<P>
 Combs retired Corona in order in the bottom of the seventh to send La Quinta 
to the championship game again. The Aztecs lost to Tustin, 3-2, last season at 
Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew I'd get my chance sooner or later," said Combs, who picked up his 
second save. "Coach always told me he'd need me for something like this, but 
this is just amazing. 
</P>
<P>
 "To come up with that hit and close the game. Wow." 
</P>
<P>
 Second-seeded La Quinta (27-3) will play West Torrance (25-6) for the title 
Saturday at Cal State Fullerton. West Torrance beat Whittier La Serna, 10-4, in 
Tuesday's other semifinal. 
</P>
<P>
 Had it not been for Combs, La Quinta would be watching the final. 
</P>
<P>
 He pinch hit for Jim Livernois (14-3), who relieved Garcia in the sixth inning 
and drove in the Aztecs' first two runs of the game with a fifth-inning single. 
Livernois, could not bat after he injured his wrist while stealing a base in 
the fifth inning. 
</P>
<P>
 Darr (1-1), pitching in relief of Ed Hurtado, opened the inning by walking 
leadoff hitter Charlie Tuggle. Tuggle went to second and C.J. Livernois, Jim's 
younger brother, was safe at first when a throw by Corona first baseman Johnny 
Owens to nail Tuggle at second pulled shortstop Ryan Darr, Mike's younger 
brother, off the bag. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike struck out the next two batters to get to Combs. 
</P>
<P>
 After La Quinta took the lead, all that stood between Combs and the hero's 
role were the Panthers' Nos. 8, 9 and 1 hitters. They didn't stand a chance. 
Combs got a strikeout and two ground outs.

DIVISION I SOFTBALL; TESSMAN HELPS FOOTHILL BEAT LOMPOC IN NINTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Foothill's Robin Tessman didn't have much success in her first three at-bats 
in the Knights' 1-0 extra-inning victory over Lompoc in the Southern Section 
Division I semifinal Tuesday at Canyon High. 
</P>
<P>
 But after striking out, grounding out and reaching base on a fielder's choice, 
Tessman helped win the game despite never putting the ball in play. 
</P>
<P>
 With runners on the corners and none out in the ninth, Tessman fouled off the 
first six pitches she saw from Brave starter Kim Wuest. The seventh pitch 
landed in the dirt, bouncing past Lompoc catcher Becky Hunter, allowing 
Michelle Churnock to score the winning run. The Knights advanced to the final 
against Marina (25-2) on Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
 "One more pitch and I was going to die," Tessman said. "All I had to do was 
battle, and I won the battle. (Wuest) broke first." 
</P>
<P>
 The loss was a bitter end to an outstanding game for Wuest (18-2), a senior 
who struck out 15 and didn't give up a hit until the seventh inning. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't think we were going to get a thing against (Wuest)," Foothill Coach 
Joe Gonzalez said. "We couldn't stay off the high pitch. Our speed game helped 
us. 
</P>
<P>
 "Marie (Gieron) pitched one of her better games. Our defense wasn't quite as 
strong as it has been for her." 
</P>
<P>
 Gieron (12-4) gave up only one hit, a two-out single in the second inning, and 
retired 10 in a row at one point. 
</P>
<P>
 Lompoc couldn't capitalize on its two scoring opportunities. Gieron forced two 
straight pop-outs with runners on second and third in the fourth inning, and 
struck out Colleen Mitchell with two on in the seventh.

DIVISION I BASEBALL; PONCHAK PROVIDES BARONS RELIEF THEY NEED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS FOSTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Chris Ponchak, lucky coin in his pocket, nasty disposition in his head, did 
what he does best Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Ponchak, Fountain Valley High School's relief pitcher with an attitude, 
snarled, stomped and paced. His act allowed the Barons to walk a fine line and 
come away with a 4-1 victory over La Crescenta Crescenta Valley in the Southern 
Section Division I semifinals at Blair Field. 
</P>
<P>
 It was vintage Ponchak, who got the Barons out of a jam and retired seven of 
the last nine batters to put them in Friday's title game against Lakewood. 
Fountain Valley will attempt to become the first top-seeded team to win this 
division since Lakewood in 1970. 
</P>
<P>
 A big chunk of the reason belongs to Ponchak, that big chunk of a reliever. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's the answer for us," catcher Dan Hoppie said. "He snaps at the ball when 
I throw back to him. You know he wants to be out there." 
</P>
<P>
 Ponchak entered the game with two outs in the fifth and the score tied, 1-1. 
He inherited a runner on third and a 1-0 count to Kasey Canale. Ponchak 
proceeded to throw seven consecutive balls to load the bases. 
</P>
<P>
 "It didn't worry me," said Ponchak, called Big Dog by his teammates. "I knew I 
would find the rhythm and that would be the game." 
</P>
<P>
 Ponchak struck out clean-up hitter John French to end the inning. He then 
mowed down the Falcons (19-6), striking out four batters and giving up only a 
single and a walk. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know what it is, but I love to close out games," Ponchak said. "I get 
fired up out there.' 
</P>
<P>
 Ponchak (8-2), highly emotional and a bit superstitious, carries a coin in his 
back pocket -- given to him by his father -- for luck and accents each pitch by 
walking toward home plate to get the ball back. 
</P>
<P>
 "He needs to get fired up like that to be effective," Coach Ron LaRuffa said. 
"The closer he gets to home plate, the better I feel." 
</P>
<P>
 It was about the only time that LaRuffa was comfortable. 
</P>
<P>
 The Barons (26-3-1) had scored 34 runs through the first three playoffs games, 
but had to scratch for runs against the Falcons' Jim Parque. 
</P>
<P>
 Parque, a 5-foot-9, 145-pound senior, began the game with 149 strikeouts in 79 
innings. 
</P>
<P>
 Parque (12-3), who has signed with UCLA, was on target through the first few 
innings, striking out five in three innings. He took a 1-0 lead into the 
fourth, as the Barons gave up an unearned run. 
</P>
<P>
 With two outs in the second, Marty Lane walked, then was caught leaning by 
Liuzzi. Lane broke for second, but first baseman Luke Fox's throw hit Lane in 
the back. Brian Peterson singled for a 1-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 The Barons scored on wild pitches in the fourth and fifth. Fountain Valley got 
some breathing room in the sixth as Hoppie drove in one run with a triple and 
Kevin Burford followed with a single. 
</P>
<P>
 The Barons then turned it over to Ponchak, again. 
</P>
<P>
 Said LaRuffa: "He was in control."

MARINA WINS AFTER PACIFICA ERROR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN HENDERSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's unfortunate Autumn Gwinner's first nine innings Tuesday will be 
overshadowed by her 10th. 
</P>
<P>
 Had it not been for four outstanding defensive plays by the Pacifica second 
baseman, the Mariners might never have reached the 10th inning of the Southern 
Section Division I semifinal against top-seeded Marina. But once there, Gwinner 
had the kind of inning that bad dreams are made of. 
</P>
<P>
 She committed one error that allowed pinch-runner Angela Alvarez to reach 
third base, and then had the ball stick in her glove, allowing Alvarez to score 
the winning run in Marina's 1-0 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're human," Mariner Coach Rob Weil said. "They're going to make mistakes. 
They're kids." 
</P>
<P>
 It brought an end to fourth-seeded Pacifica's playoff run. The Mariners 
(21-6-1) had not allowed a run in three playoff victories, and Toni Mascarenas 
(15-4) had thrown five consecutive shutouts. But all went for naught when they 
could not handle the pressure of Marina's only scoring threat. 
</P>
<P>
 "It could've gone on forever," said Marina pitcher Marcy Crouch (21-2), who 
anticipated something akin to last year's 22-inning quarterfinal against Los 
Alamitos. "We were lucky . . . It was whoever cashed it in." 
</P>
<P>
 The payoff came in the 10th. After going five innings without a hit against 
Mascarenas, Marina (25-2) got a one-out single by Heather Williams. Alvarez 
pinch-ran for the catcher, and got a good jump on Faith Fuata's bouncer to 
Gwinner, who looked to see if she had a play on Alvarez and then rushed her 
throw to first base -- it was wide left. Alvarez took third base and Fuata 
second. Staci Byers was intentionally walked to load the bases. 
</P>
<P>
 Heather Hibben -- robbed by Gwinner in the second inning with a runner on 
first -- faced a drawn-in infield. Hibben hit a bouncer to Gwinner, who reached 
into her glove -- and couldn't pull the ball out cleanly. By the time she made 
the attempted force play at home, Alvarez had crossed the plate, giving Marina 
its 15th consecutive victory and stopping Pacifica's winning streak at 11. 
</P>
<P>
 Marina plays unseeded Foothill (25-6) in Saturday's championship game at 7:30 
p.m. at Lakewood's Mayfair Park. The Vikings won the Division 5-A title in 
1990, and Foothill won the 4-A title in 1992. Marina defeated Foothill, 2-0, in 
last year's playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Pacifica stranded eight runners over the final five innings, and had runners 
at second base in each of the final four. The game's key play came in the 
eighth. Marina second baseman Becky Thompson caught Rachelle Breig's line drive 
with runners at first and second. She stepped on second for the double play and 
saved the shutout. 
</P>
<P>
 Much attention was focused on Marina's defense, which made two errors, but 
neither hurt the Vikings, who escaped jam after jam. 
</P>
<P>
 "At this stage, everybody is good and you can't make mistakes, and you can't 
hang your head," Marina Coach Shelly Luth said. "You have to go on. No one 
makes a mistake on purpose."

OUTDOOR NOTES / PETE THOMAS: THE REEL WORLD CUP TOURNAMENT WILL BEGIN TODAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETE THOMAS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For fishermen throughout most of the United States and Canada, the World Cup 
kicks off today. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chevy Truck World Cup of Fishing, that is. Brain child of David Abbott, 
the event begins today and lasts through July 30, with $2.1 million in prizes 
at stake. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is something new and different," says Abbott, a Winnipeg marketing 
consultant. "The fishing industry hasn't (become) elevated as such sports as 
golf and tennis have, in terms of big purses and recognition. I wanted to have 
a tournament to allow the average guy to hit the big time." 
</P>
<P>
 Participants can fish anywhere in the United States and Canada -- except 
Hawaii -- for any of 15 species. Anglers must first buy an entry kit for $10 at 
Kmart, in which they receive personal identification to use to report their 
catch.  
</P>
<P>
 In the catch-and-release event, each fish must be photographed against an 
official measuring stick for proof and registered via telephone. Catches are 
ranked using a conversion scale to account for regional differences in fish 
size. 
</P>
<P>
 Anglers can enter as often as they like. A daily prize of $200 will be awarded 
for the best catch in every state and Canadian province, and winners could 
advance to one of five regional playoffs -- each worth $100,000 in prize money, 
with $50,000 going to the winner -- that will culminate in a nationally 
televised final at an as-yet unnamed location for a $1-million grand prize. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside each entry kit is a conversion chart and an explanation of rules and 
regulations. 
</P>

<P>
 From time to time, Southland wildlife officials have to deal with a wayward 
bear that wanders into a residential area. 
</P>
<P>
 But in at least one portion of Northern California, such incidents are 
occurring with alarming frequency. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll bet that over the past two months, we've received an average of two 
calls a day about bear problems," says Jon Dunn, a Department of Fish and Game 
warden in Eureka. 
</P>
<P>
 Dunn said bears in suburban Eureka are rattling garbage cans, strolling 
through yards and stealing pet food. One even wandered near a 7-year-old girl 
waiting at a bus stop. 
</P>
<P>
 The DFG isn't sure how to deal with the problem. The public's response has 
been, "Why don't you trap the bear and take it somewhere else?" 
</P>
<P>
 The DFG says such a procedure is neither humane nor practical given the spread 
of development and the decline of wildlife habitat. Besides, officials say, 
bears trapped and moved have been known to travel up to 50 miles back to where 
they were captured. And those that remain in a new area often must compete with 
other bears for limited food supply. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many people who call don't want us to kill the bear, but they don't seem to 
care what its chances for survival would be if it were moved elsewhere," Dunn 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 For the time being, the DFG's policy is aimed at eliminating what attracts the 
bears in the first place, namely the improper treatment of garbage and fruit 
trees without electric fencing. 
</P>
<P>
 Dunn said residents should know what they are getting into when they buy homes 
in areas that previously supported bears. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe the time has come in these new developments for real estate disclosure 
forms to tell potential buyers what they can expect in wildlife experiences," 
he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Briefly 
</P>
<P>
 SALTWATER FISHING -- The Southland sportfishing scene has emerged from its 
early spring doldrums, with barracuda nearly everywhere. Bonito and sand bass 
have even begun to show in time for the twilight operations that began on 
Memorial Day weekend. At the southern Channel Islands, yellowtail and white 
seabass are showing enough to keep the interest of the overnight crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 Cabo San Lucas: After four days of gale-force winds that restricted the boats 
to small-game fishing close to shore, there have been three consecutive days of 
perfect weather. "Fishing was pretty bad, but on Monday boats were back to 
catching three to four marlin," said Juan Arce of the Pisces fleet. Arce said 
striped marlin are taking mostly live bait off Palmilla and near Chileno, and 
added that the water has warmed to 71 degrees and that sailfish are making an 
early showing. Pargo fishing remains excellent for those staying close to 
shore. 
</P>
<P>
 East Cape: Tuna, dorado and marlin are plentiful, with tuna the primary 
bait-taker in the northern region -- some pushing 100 pounds, according to 
reports out of Hotel Palmas de Cortez -- and dorado and marlin are scattered 
throughout the region. 
</P>
<P>
 Loreto: Fishing is excellent for those who like to work the bottom. Pargo, 
whitefish, cabrilla and triggerfish are plentiful. 
</P>
<P>
 San Diego long-range: The Royal Polaris called in Tuesday from Mexico's 
Revillagigedo Islands, reporting more than 100 wahoo and, after a slow start, 
100- to 200-pound tuna at Roca Partida. The boat returns June 9. The Royal 
Star, on an eight-day trip to the Alijos Rocks, reported slow to fair fishing 
for yellowfin tuna and big yellowtail. As others have done before them, they 
ran into a school of bluefin tuna on the way down. 
</P>
<P>
 MISCELLANY -- Quail Unlimited's annual Celebrity Sporting Clays Fun Shoot, 
including a raffle and an auction, will be held June 11 at 8:30 a.m. at 
Raahauge's in Norco. Details: (909) 597-0423. . . . The annual Whitewater 
Wednesday Rafting Jamboree, featuring $17.50 rides on the Kern River to kick 
off the rafting season, will be held June 15 beginning at 9 a.m. Details: (619) 
376-2629.

FISHING REPORT: EASTERN SIERRA TROUT ANGLERS HAPPILY THROWN FOR THE LOOP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 During the Memorial Day weekend, trout fishermen flocked to the Eastern Sierra 
in numbers not seen since opening day, and those who settled in along the June 
Loop apparently had the most success. 
</P>
<P>
 Tony Stevens of Reseda caught an 8-pound cutthroat trout from shore on a 
Panther Martin lure, and Sean Kaziwara of Ridgecrest took a 6-0 rainbow on 
Power Bait. 
</P>
<P>
 At Gull Lake, Mike Borba of Bishop caught a 5-0 rainbow on an olive woolly 
bugger fly. At Grant Lake, Bruce Hill of Downey landed a 4-11 rainbow on a gold 
Hot Shot lure, and at Rush Creek Bill Hansen of Los Alamitos caught a 3-9 
rainbow on red salmon eggs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had some excellent fishing, and on a little bit of everything -- not 
just Power Bait," Elayne Logue of Ernies Tackle said.

PLAYOFFS AT A GLANCE; SOUTHERN SECTION TEAM TENNIS DIVISION I FINAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Today's schedule: Santa Barbara (24-0) vs. Dana Hills (23-0), Knowlwood Tennis 
Club, Montecito, 3:15 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 * Defending champion: Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
 * Outlook: Dana Hills Coach John Stephens is trying to put the best spin on 
his team's chances against seven-time defending champion Santa Barbara, which 
had its closest playoff match in the first round, a 16 1/3-4 2/3 victory over 
Westlake Village Westlake. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to be able to go up there relaxed," Stephens said. "The kids know 
they're going to go up there and have some fun. The pressure's on them. We'll 
just see if we can surprise them." 
</P>
<P>
 But from hearing Santa Barbara's players talk, it doesn't sound as if they're 
taking Dana Hills lightly. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're pretty confident against this team, but we're not going to 
underestimate them," Santa Barbara's Ian Carrera said. "Even though we've won 
seven times in a row, you have to play it like you've never won it before." 
</P>
<P>
 Carrera and Jimmy Walker, who lost in the section individual quarterfinals 
last weekend, said they are expecting Stephens to do some fiddling with the 
lineup. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems like their singles are sort of weak, so they'll probably go for the 
doubles," Walker said. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Carrera: "They'll probably stack their doubles. They probably think they 
have a shot at us now since we lost (in the section individuals)." 
</P>
<P>
 But according to Stephens, he won't do much with his lineup. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's nothing I can do now," he said. "I pretty much just have to go with 
what I have." 
</P>
<P>
 What he has is a pretty deep and talented high school tennis team, but is it 
good enough to beat the likes of Walker, Carrera and Nathan Jackmon, the Ojai 
singles champion and section semifinalist? Probably not, but the score might be 
closer than people think. DAVE McKIBBEN

BASEBALL DAILY REPORT; ANGELS; TEARS IN RAIN FOR ANGELS' DREAM INNING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB NIGHTENGALE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Considering the Angels had an abundance of free time Tuesday night after their 
game was rained out in the first inning against the Cleveland Indians, what 
were they planning to do? 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just going to go home and cry," Angel left fielder Dwight Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 Said first baseman Eduardo Perez: "And I'm going to join him." 
</P>
<P>
 Perez hit a two-run homer in the first inning off rookie Julian Tavarez, and 
Smith had a two-run triple . . . all to be washed away. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I struck out, it would have been clear as day," Smith said. "I'm telling 
you, this game will get you one way or the other." 
</P>
<P>
 Perez, who had not homered since April 21, said he took advice from teammate 
Gary DiSarcina and began praying. 
</P>
<P>
 "But Tavarez beat me to it," Perez said. 
</P>
<P>
 After a 35-minute delay, the Angels (23-29), who had lost three consecutive 
games, jumped out to a 4-0 lead in the first inning. But after Angel starter 
Joe Magrane had two outs with runners on first and second in the bottom of the 
inning, the rain returned. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew it was too good to be true to have a four-spot in the first inning," 
said Magrane, who will have to wait until at least Sunday to pitch again. 
"Those are the type of games you dream about." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 There has been no date set for the makeup game, but because Cleveland already 
has four doubleheaders the second half of the season, Manager Mike Hargrove 
suggested Aug. 15. That would ruin the Angels' off-day between Detroit and 
Milwaukee. It's more likely that the game will be rescheduled for Sept. 2. BOB

NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP; PADRES RIDE 13-RUN INNING TO THEIR FIFTH VICTORY IN A 
ROW, 15-5 
</P>

<P>
 The San Diego Padres, with the 13th-ranked offense in a 14-team league, tied a 
team record by scoring 13 runs against the Pittsburgh Pirates in the second 
inning Tuesday night in San Diego for their fifth consecutive victory, 15-5. 
</P>
<P>
 The Padres set a club record by having the first 11 batters reach base in the 
inning, and matched a club mark for runs and hits in an inning set last Aug. 24 
in the first inning against the St. Louis Cardinals. 
</P>
<P>
 Bip Roberts hit a three-run homer, Phil Plantier added a three-run triple and 
pitcher Andy Benes (3-9) had a two-run double in the second inning, when the 
Padres got nine of their season-high 16 hits. 
</P>
<P>
 The Padres, beginning the game batting .251, benefited from three walks and 
errors by pitchers Steve Cooke (1-5) and John Hope in the inning. 
</P>
<P>
 Atlanta 6, San Francisco 3 -- Javier Lopez broke a ninth-inning tie with a 
leadoff homer for the Braves in San Francisco. But the real story was new Brave 
leadoff hitter Roberto Kelly, who hit a two-run homer in the seventh. 
</P>
<P>
 Since being acquired from the Cincinnati Reds on Sunday in a trade for Deion 
Sanders, Kelly is four for nine with a double and a home run as the Braves have 
staged consecutive game-winning rallies. 
</P>
<P>
 Overshadowed was the Giants' Matt Williams, who homered in the first inning, 
tying the National League record for homers in the first two months of the 
season at 19. The NL record was set in 1987 by Eric Davis of Cincinnati. Ken 
Griffey Jr. of Seattle set the major league record with 22 this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Colorado 3, New York 2 -- Greg Harris gave up five hits in eight innings to 
lead the Rockies in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Walt Weiss went three for four and drove in a run for the Rockies, while 
former Met Howard Johnson went two for four with an RBI. 
</P>
<P>
 Harris (3-4) struck out three and gave up one walk before being replaced by 
Bruce Ruffin, who pitched the ninth for his fifth save. Doug Linton (4-2) took 
the loss while giving up six hits and three runs in five innings. 
</P>
<P>
 Philadelphia 8, Chicago 7 -- Jim Eisenreich's two-out RBI single in the eighth 
inning beat the Cubs in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 Trailing by 7-5 in the eighth, the Phillies rallied for three runs against 
Jose Bautista and Randy Myers (0-2). Kim Batiste and Mickey Morandini got 
singles against Bautista, then Myers retired the next two before Mariano Duncan 
hit a two-run double to tie the score at 7. 
</P>
<P>
 Eisenreich, 10 for 23 in his last seven games, followed with a single to left, 
ending Chicago's seven-game home winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
 Typical of the Cubs' evening, it was Jose Guzman Photo Card Night at Wrigley 
Field -- and the team announced that pitcher Guzman would undergo arthroscopic 
surgery on his right shoulder and might be sidelined for the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Houston 5, Florida 3 -- Andujar Cedeno hit a two-run single to break an 
eighth-inning tie for the Astros in Houston. 
</P>
<P>
 In the eighth, Luis Gonzalez and Chris Donnels hit two-out singles, then 
pinch-hitter Kevin Bass walked to load the bases. Cedeno followed with a single 
to left field off Richie Lewis (1-3). 
</P>
<P>
 Cincinnati 5, Montreal 4 -- Reggie Sanders led off the bottom of the 13th 
inning with his second homer of the game to give the Reds the victory at 
Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanders worked Jeff Shaw (2-2) to a full count, fouled off a breaking ball and 
then hit a belt-high fastball beyond the wall in center field for his ninth 
homer. Cincinnati's third victory in its last 11 games made the Reds 7-1 in 
extra-inning games this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin Mitchell put the Reds ahead by 3-1 in the fourth with his fourth homer 
in seven at-bats. Mitchell now has 15 homers, four shy of his total last 
season.

AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP; BOGGS IS BRONX BOMBER AGAIN IN YANKEE WIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press

<TEXT>
<P>
 To Wade Boggs, it doesn't matter whether the baseball is livelier this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't care if it's juiced, you still have to hit it," Boggs said after his 
first-inning home run started the New York Yankees on a rout of the Chicago 
White Sox, 10-1, Tuesday at Yankee Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Boggs has hit six home runs this season, three times as many as last season. 
</P>
<P>
 Boggs also had an RBI single and Gerald Williams homered as New York ended a 
two-game losing streak. The Yankees, with the best record in the majors, have 
not lost three in a row since the second week of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul O'Neill was hitless in five at-bats for the Yankees and has now gone 
hitless in consecutive games for the first time this season, dropping his major 
league-leading average from .459 to .428. 
</P>
<P>
 Oakland 7, Toronto 2 -- Ron Darling (4-6) struck out eight in Toronto as the 
A's won their fourth in a row over the Blue Jays, who fell to 10 games behind 
the East-leading Yankees. It was only the 15th victory for the A's, who have 
baseball's worst record. 
</P>
<P>
 Texas 7, Milwaukee 4 -- Oddibe McDowell drove in three runs and Roger Pavlik 
earned his first victory with seven strong innings in Milwaukee as the Rangers 
won for the fourth time in five games. 
</P>
<P>
 McDowell and Rusty Greer each had two-run singles off Jaime Navarro (2-5) in 
the first inning, and the struggling pitcher never recovered. 
</P>
<P>
 Kansas City 9, Boston 7 -- Mike Macfarlane made up for an error and getting 
thrown out at home by hitting a grand slam for the Royals in Boston. Brian 
McRae was the other offensive star for the Royals with the first five-hit game 
of his career: four singles and an RBI double. 
</P>
<P>
 With Boston ahead 2-1, McRae led off the fourth with a single. Walks to Dave 
Henderson and Felix Jose loaded the bases before Macfarlane hit his seventh 
homer. 
</P>
<P>
 Detroit 7, Baltimore 6 -- Cecil Fielder, Kirk Gibson and Junior Felix homered 
in a five-run fifth inning that lifted the Tigers past the slumping Orioles in 
Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
 Leo Gomez, Harold Baines and Mark McLemore homered for the Orioles, who have 
lost four of five. 
</P>
<P>
 Detroit snapped a 2-2 tie in the fifth against rookie Mike Oquist (1-1). 
Travis Fryman hit a two-out double and Fielder broke a 14-game homerless 
drought with his 12th. Gibson followed with his 10th homer. After Mickey 
Tettleton walked, Felix drove a pitch into the center field seats. 
</P>
<P>
 That finished Oquist, making his first major league start. He is best known so 
far for hitting five batters in 17 2/3 innings, one Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Minnesota 6, Seattle 2 -- Scott Erickson made a successful return from the 
disabled list, limiting Seattle to four hits in six innings for the Twins in 
Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
 Kirby Puckett drove in three runs with a bases-loaded single and a walk for 
the Twins as they handed the Mariners their sixth loss in eight games. Puckett 
recorded his ninth assist, most among AL outfielders.

 Today's pairings: Division I -- Santa Barbara (24-0) vs. Dana Hills (23-0) at 
Knollwood Tennis Club (Montecito). III -- Pasadena Poly (19-3) vs.Brentwood 
(18-3) at Riviera Country Club. IV -- Santa Ynez (19-3) vs. Calabasas (16-4) at 
Agoura High, all at 3 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year's champions: Division I -- Santa Barbara. III -- Burbank. IV -- 
Nordhoff. 
</P>
<P>
 Outlook: Santa Barbara has won six consecutive team titles. The Dons finished 
the season undefeated despite the loss of Alex Decret, who graduated after last 
season. Decret won the 1993 Southern Section singles championship and gave the 
Dons their only singles victories in their 11-7 victory over Peninsula in last 
season's team final. Santa Barbara's No. 1 singles player, Nathan Jackmon, was 
top seeded in the singles tournament but was upset by Temple City's Sandy 
Gentile, 0-6, 7-5, 6-1, in the semifinals Saturday. Santa Barbara's No. 1 
doubles team of Ian Carrera and Jimmy Walker won the boys' doubles championship 
at Ojai, but were upset by Jason Meyers and Robbie Wilkins of University, 6-2, 
6-2, Friday, in the quarterfinals of the Southern Section doubles tournament. 
In Division III, two familiar teams return to the final. Before last year, 
Pasadena Poly and Brentwood had met in the final in four consecutive years. 
Pasadena Poly defeated Brentwood for the title in 1989, '91 and '92; Brentwood 
beat Pasadena Poly for the championship in '90. WENDY WITHERSPOON

BASEBALL DAILY REPORT; DODGERS; WORRELL GETS A VOTE OF CONFIDENCE 
</P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Todd Worrell and Manager Tom Lasorda have met and discussed the closer 
situation, one that Worrell had concerns about after being taken out of 
Sunday's game in the ninth inning. Worrell said Lasorda told him he is still 
the closer. 
</P>
<P>
 "We talked about that and other things," Worrell said, "but everything is 
fine. I told Tommy that when I have pitched other places I'm used to staying 
out there until I got the job done or not. I haven't been taken out of games 
like that until I came here, and it's not something I'm used to dealing with. 
But Tommy told me that in that situation, he didn't think I had my stuff, and 
that's his prerogative. " 
</P>
<P>
 Worrell put the tying and winning runs on in the ninth inning with one out 
Sunday before Darren Dreifort relieved him and got the final two outs.  
</P>
<P>
 Since returning from the disabled list May 23, Worrell has struggled, blowing 
two saves in five appearances, but says his arm feels fine.

<P>
 As expected, the Houston Astros released reliever Mitch Williams Tuesday. In 
anticipation of the move, Williams, 29, had already left the team to return to 
his Texas ranch. 
</P>
<P>
 Officially, Williams was placed on waivers for the purpose of giving him his 
unconditional release. If he isn't claimed -- and no claims are expected -- he 
will be released Friday. The Astros are responsible for the rest of his 
$2.5-million salary this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams, obtained in a trade with Philadelphia on Dec. 2, was 1-4 this season 
with a 7.65 earned-run average. He had six saves with two blown chances and 
gave up 21 hits and walked 24 batters in 20 innings.

SAUGUS FORCED TO FACE THE MUSIC AGAINST FULLERTON; DIVISION II SOFTBALL: 
TOP-SEEDED CENTURIONS ALLOW PREGAME DISTRACTIONS TO CARRY OVER IN 
MISTAKE-FILLED LOSS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Distracted before the game even got started, the Saugus High softball team 
uncharacteristically made four mistakes and lost to Fullerton, 2-1, Tuesday in 
front of about 250 fans in a Southern Section Division II semifinal game at 
Fullerton College. 
</P>
<P>
 Saugus (27-3-1), top-seeded in the division, helped Fullerton's cause with two 
passed balls, a wild pitch and a dropped popup in foul territory. Each of the 
mistakes contributed to the Indians' two runs. 
</P>
<P>
 Saugus Coach Ron Hilton said loud music blaring from the public address system 
before the game distracted the Centurions. 
</P>
<P>
 "That music," he said. "We're trying to focus before the game and couldn't. 
It's a distraction." 
</P>
<P>
 The partisan Fullerton crowd made its own music in the bottom of the seventh 
inning. With the scored tied, 1-1, with one out, Nadia Hoerner lined a single 
into left for the Indians. Ashley Jones was inserted as a pinch-runner and the 
crowd directly behind the backstop began a chant. 
</P>
<P>
 On her next delivery, Saugus' Jamie Gillies threw a wild pitch and Jones went 
to second. A pitch later, Jones advanced to third on a passed ball. With each 
pitch the chant grew louder until Miller hit a 3-2 offering through the right 
side to score Jones and send the Indians into a frenzy. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton will play Bishop Amat, a 3-1 winner over Canyon on Tuesday, in the 
championship game. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some things are just destined to be," Hilton said. "They did the things they 
had to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Gillies (23-3), who pitched a four-hitter, struck out five and retired the 
first nine batters, placed the blame on herself. Hilton didn't see it that way. 
</P>
<P>
 "That girl won 23 ballgames for us this season -- she carried us all year," 
Hilton said. "Jamie didn't lose this game. There were three or four things we 
didn't do right today." 
</P>
<P>
 Saugus opened the scoring in the second inning when Nicole Giordano looped a 
single into shallow right field to drive in sister Jeanine, who had drawn a 
walk and advanced to second on Nicole Giacalone's sacrifice. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton (18-13) pulled even in the fourth. Kiki McAulay led off with a 
single up the middle and advanced to second on Alissa Sorrel's sacrifice. With 
one out, Angie Fancuberta hit a popup foul, but third baseman Chris Gill took 
her eye off it at the last moment and dropped the ball. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think she's made an error all year," Hilton said. 
</P>
<P>
 One pitch later, Fancuberta struck out, but McAulay went to third when the 
third strike got by catcher Jeanine Giordano for a passed ball. 
</P>
<P>
 Deborah Hargrave's infield single drove in McAulay to tie the score. 
</P>
<P>
 Fancuberta (18-12) pitched a three-hitter, striking out four.

DEFENSIVE LAPSES COST THE FALCONS; DIVISION I BASEBALL: MISPLAYS PLAY BIG ROLE 
CRESCENTA VALLEY'S 4-1 SEMIFINAL LOSS TO FOUNTAIN VALLEY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Opportunity knocked. 
</P>
<P>
 Fountain Valley High didn't exactly kick down the door. More like snuck in the 
bedroom window. 
</P>
<P>
 Taking advantage of several Crescenta Valley letdowns on defense, Fountain 
Valley manufactured enough offense Tuesday night to knock off the Falcons and 
left-hander Jim Parque, 4-1, in a Southern Section Division I semifinal at 
Blair Field. 
</P>
<P>
 Parque (12-3) allowed only six hits, but the top-seeded Barons took what they 
could, if not what they wanted, on the basepaths. Fountain Valley (26-3-1) was 
the willing recipient of a balk and two passed balls, while swiping four bases 
in as many attempts. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were very opportunistic," Crescenta Valley Coach Tony Zarrillo said. 
"They did a great job of taking advantage of what we gave them." 
</P>
<P>
 And there were a few gifts, to be sure. After scoring their first run on a 
wild pitch, the Barons pulled a near instant replay in the bottom of the fifth 
to take the lead for good. 
</P>
<P>
 With one out, Craig Ritter singled and moved to second on a passed ball by 
catcher John French. Parque then balked Ritter to third, and he scored from 
there after Parque fired a pitch in the dirt that bounced 10 feet away from 
French. 
</P>
<P>
 French fired to Parque, who was covering at the plate, but the UCLA-bound 
senior bobbled the throw as Fountain Valley took a 2-1 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 "That pitcher was quality, one of the best we've faced all year," said 
right-hander Chris Ponchak, who improved to 8-2 with 2 1/3 scoreless innings of 
relief. "We thought we'd have to scrap, we thought we'd have to battle, and we 
did." 
</P>
<P>
 Fountain Valley -- seeking to become the first top-seeded team in Division I 
to win the championship since 1970 -- put the game away with two runs in the 
sixth when Parque surrendered three consecutive hits, including a run-scoring 
triple by Dan Hoppie. 
</P>
<P>
 Crescenta Valley mounted a threat in the top of the seventh, but Kirk Hagge 
flied out to left with runners at second and third to end it. 
</P>
<P>
 Crescenta Valley (19-6) didn't muster much offensively. The Falcons managed 
only three hits off Jason Liuzzi and Ponchak, who combined to strike out nine. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was very impressed with their pitching," Zarrillo said. "Man, we had to 
hang in tooth and nail to stay in the ballgame." 
</P>
<P>
 It was nail-biting time for Fountain Valley in the fifth. With the score tied, 
1-1, Ponchak relieved Liuzzi and walked two batters to load the bases with two 
out. However, Ponchak retired French, the clean-up hitter, on a called third 
strike to end the threat. 
</P>
<P>
 "That could have been a big plus for from an emotional standpoint," Zarrillo 
said. "It was a little deflating for us and I think it gave them a lift." 
</P>
<P>
 Crescenta Valley scored its run in the second, with a little help from the 
Fountain Valley defense. After earning a two-out walk, Marty Lane was picked 
off first by Liuzzi. However, first baseman Luke Fox hit Lane in the back on 
the ensuing throw to second.  
</P>
<P>
 Lane scored on a single to center by third baseman Brian Peterson.

BOWEN STIFLES NORMALLY POWERFUL SPARTANS, 4-1, IN SEMIFINALS.

 It's the way the high school baseball playoffs work: Keep going until you run 
into a pitcher you can't hit. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday was the day the Rio Mesa High baseball team found left-hander Larrie 
Bowen, who left the Spartans flailing their bats through the air in a 4-1 loss 
to J.W. North of Riverside in a Southern Section Division II semifinal at 
Ventura College. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought (Bowen) threw a good game," Rio Mesa Coach Richard Duran said. "He 
located well and he threw some good pitches, but generally we have hit the ball 
a lot better." 
</P>
<P>
 The Spartans (21-7) finished the regular season hitting .347 and averaging 
more than eight runs per game, but the runs began to run out in the 
quarterfinals Friday, when Rio Mesa defeated Hart, 1-0, in nine innings. 
</P>
<P>
 Bowen, who has 10 of the Huskies' 17 victories, gave up four hits and three 
walks in 6 1/3 innings. He struck out seven, including three in a row after the 
Spartans had put runners at first and second with none out in the second 
inning. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was pretty good but we couldn't hit him," Rio Mesa right fielder Chad 
Snyder said. "We couldn't wait back (on his curve ball). We just weren't there 
100% at the beginning. If we would have been, we would have had him." 
</P>
<P>
 The Spartans didn't figure out Bowen until the seventh inning, and even then 
they weren't hitting him hard. Vince Roman led off the inning by reaching on a 
dropped popup by first baseman Kris Hiraoka. After a flyout, Marcus Yasutake 
walked and Johnny Espinoza drove in a run with a looping single to right field. 
</P>
<P>
 North Coach Tom Kennedy then pulled Bowen in favor of Justin Solis, who 
retired Steve Arneson and Snyder to record his fifth save. 
</P>
<P>
 The Huskies (17-11), took advantage of the usually brisk Ventura winds and 
some Rio Mesa misplays to collect all the runs they would need against starter 
Don DiDomizio (6-2). 
</P>
<P>
 Pat Hanchee walked to lead off the first, then took second when third baseman 
Eric Flores made a wild throw trying to double him off after a lineout. The 
error was costly, because Hanchee scored on Adam Kennedy's ground-rule double. 
</P>
<P>
 In the third, North cleanup hitter Jimm Bowen lifted a two-out bloop into left 
field. The wind made it a difficult play for left fielder Charlie Boch, and the 
ball dropped, allowing two runs to score. 
</P>
<P>
 DiDomizio, who had struck out 13 in a complete-game shutout in his last start, 
was lifted after 3 2/3 innings. He was charged with all four runs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don struggled and he'd be the first to tell you," Duran said. "He just didn't 
have it, for whatever reason. Stuff, I mean. He had it in the heart. He just 
didn't have the stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 Junior left-hander Richard Soliz, who threw a nine-inning shutout Friday 
against Hart, finished the game for DiDomizio. Soliz pitched 3 1/3 scoreless 
innings, giving up only two hits.

PRO BASEBALL / JEFF FLETCHER; VATCHER TURNS MOUND OF LUCK INTO A VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF FLETCHER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 So that's Jim Vatcher's problem. He's been playing the wrong position. 
</P>
<P>
 Vatcher, a journeyman outfielder in the New York Mets' system, is 2-0 in his 
career as a pitcher. And the former Cal State Northridge player picked up his 
most recent victory in unusual style. 
</P>
<P>
 Vatcher's triple-A Norfolk, Va., team trailed Scranton-Wilkes Barre, Pa., 
10-4, in the second game of a doubleheader two weeks ago. The Tides lost the 
first game in 13 innings and seemed destined for another defeat, so Manager 
Bobby Valentine summoned Vatcher from left field to pitch the sixth inning. 
</P>
<P>
 Vatcher walked one batter, but retired the other three. 
</P>
<P>
 In the top of the seventh and final inning, Norfolk's first two batters made 
outs. But the Tides proceeded to score 10 runs to take a 14-10 lead. Three runs 
scored on a home run by Vatcher. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tides then trotted closer Mike Cook to the mound in the bottom of the 
seventh to finish up Vatcher's victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "(The pitchers) told me it was the worst vulture they'd ever seen," Vatcher 
said, referring to a baseball term for an easy victory. 
</P>
<P>
 But this was not Vatcher's first win. He pitched three innings in an 
extra-inning game for triple-A Las Vegas in 1991. Vatcher, 28, guesses he's 
pitched about five times in his eight-year pro career. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can throw a curve and a changeup," he said, "but in those situations I'm 
challenging the hitters with fastballs. When they are facing a position player, 
they are basically just trying to take me deep, so their concentration isn't 
quite there." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Add Vatcher: Vatcher's home run in that wild game came against Ricky 
Bottalico. In Vatcher's only other at-bat against Bottalico, a few weeks 
earlier, he hit a game-winning grand slam with the Tides trailing by three in 
the bottom of the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
 Bottalico was expected by many to be the Philadelphia Phillies' closer this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that's going to take another year or so," Vatcher said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Say Eeeeeee's: Think the St. Louis Cardinals are worried about 1991 
first-round pick Dmitri Young's continued trouble on defense? Young had made 12 
errors in 40 games at first base this season for double-A Arkansas, but the 
organization is more concerned about Young at the plate. 
</P>
<P>
 The dinner plate. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to make sure he doesn't eat himself out a major league career," said 
Scott Smulczenski, the Cardinals' assistant director of player development. "We 
wish he would be a little more conscious of what he does off the field." 
</P>
<P>
 Young, a former Rio Mesa High standout, packs about 240 pounds on his 6-foot-2 
frame. He is hitting his weight -- batting .256 with three home runs and 15 
runs batted in. 
</P>
<P>
 Young's on-field problem continues to be his defense. He was moved from third 
to first base near the end of last season and made seven errors. Apparently, he 
hasn't improved much. But the Cardinals aren't overly worried because Young is 
only 20 years old. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously we think he is going to be a major league player," Smulczenski 
said. "At his age, playing at the level he's at, he's OK." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Bosom Buddies: Ken Kendrena and Mike Sims were pals when they were teammates 
at Cal State Northridge. Kendrena, a 1992 draft pick of the Florida Marlins, 
called Sims one of the best catchers he had ever thrown to, so when the Marlins 
drafted Sims in 1993, Kendrena hoped they might someday be back together. 
</P>
<P>
 Someday is now. 
</P>
<P>
 The two not only are teammates for Class-A Brevard County, Fla., but 
roommates. They share an apartment in the complex where many Marlins' major 
leaguers stay during spring training. 
</P>
<P>
 Sims was batting .259, and his playing time has increased with the recent 
release of former Thousand Oaks High catcher Mark Skeels. 
</P>
<P>
 Kendrena, who recently recovered from a minor bout with tendinitis, is 2-1 
with an 0.96 earned-run average. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Cookson update: Outfielder Brent Cookson (Santa Paula, Ventura College) of 
double-A Shreveport, La., is batting .333 with seven home runs, 25 RBIs and a 
.659 slugging percentage. 
</P>
<P>
 And his timing has been impeccable. 
</P>
<P>
 His three-homer, four-hit game in Arkansas earlier this month was played in 
front of his father, whom Cookson hadn't seen in four years, and his 
grandmother, whom he hadn't seen in 12 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a big thrill to get out there and see them," Cookson said. 
</P>
<P>
 His family saw him in the midst of back-to-back weeks in which Cookson won 
Texas League player of the week honors. 
</P>
<P>
 Cookson, who was drafted by the San Francisco Giants from Long Beach State in 
1991, was playing last week in Wichita, Kan., where the 49ers were playing in 
the NCAA Regionals. 
</P>
<P>
 Cookson said before the 49ers began play in the Regional that he wouldn't be 
able to see a Long Beach game, but he had dinner with 49er Coach Dave Snow. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Short Hops: Catcher Bobby Hughes (Notre Dame) is leading the Milwaukee 
Brewers' organization, major leaguers included, in RBIs. Playing at Class-A 
Stockton, Hughes has driven in 35 runs. A second-round pick from USC in 1992, 
Hughes is hitting .284 with eight home runs. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 As expected, former Newbury Park High shortstop David Lamb was promoted from 
extended spring training to the Baltimore Orioles' Class-A team in Albany, Ga., 
on May 6. Lamb, who hit better than .300 during the spring, is off to a slow 
start in Albany, hitting .212 with three errors in 15 games. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Roland De La Maza, who played at St. Genevieve High and College of the 
Canyons, returned this week from the disabled list, pitching five innings for 
Class-A Columbus, Ga. He missed about five weeks because of a sore right 
shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
 De La Maza, who impressed Cleveland Indians' officials last season by posting 
a 10-3 record with a 2.52 ERA for Class A Watertown, N.Y., is 1-0 with a 1.13 
ERA in 16 innings.

RAIN PUTS DAMPER ON ANGEL PERFORMANCES; BASEBALL: TEAM GETS A FOUR-RUN LEAD IN 
THE FIRST INNING BEFORE GAME IS POSTPONED AFTER A LENGTHY DELAY.

<P>
 So, considering the Angels had an abundance of free time Tuesday night after 
their game was rained out in the first inning against the Cleveland Indians, 
what were the fellas planning to do? 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just going to go home and cry," Angel left fielder Dwight Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 Said first baseman Eduardo Perez: "And I'm going to join him." 
</P>
<P>
 Perez hit a two-run homer in the first inning off rookie Julian Tavarez, and 
Smith had a two-run triple . . . all to be washed out. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I struck out, it would have been clear as (day)," Smith said. "I'm telling 
you, this game will get you one way or the other." 
</P>
<P>
 Perez, who had not homered since April 21, said he took Gary DiSarcina's 
advice and began praying. 
</P>
<P>
 "But Tavarez beat me to it," said Perez, who pretended to weep. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels (23-29), who have lost three consecutive games, jumped to a 4-0 
lead in the first inning. But after Angel starter Joe Magrane had two outs with 
runners on first and second, the rain came. The game started 35 minutes late, 
and the teams played only 23 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew it was too good to be true to have a four-spot in the first inning," 
said Magrane, who will have to wait until at least Sunday to pitch again. 
"Those are the type of games you dream about." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Magrane was saddened to see his lead erased by rain, it wasn't nearly 
as painful as his start in 1990 when he was pitching for the St. Louis 
Cardinals at Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was when the legendary Marge Schott kept us there until 11 at night with 
no intention of playing the game," Magrane said. "They got three outs, and the 
game was over. . . . She's had her share of unusualness."

<P>
 It was Brian Anderson Day at Jacobs Field, with about 200 people traveling 
from Anderson's hometown of Geneva to see the Angels play the Cleveland 
Indians. 
</P>
<P>
 There was only one problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson wasn't there. 
</P>
<P>
 He was in California making his second rehabilitation start for Class-A Lake 
Elsinore. Considering the tickets already were purchased and the buses 
reserved, everyone figured they might as well come. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone is here but Brian," said Janice Anderson, Brian's mother. 
"Everyone's disappointed, but they understand." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the strangest aspect for the Anderson family is rooting for the 
Angels. They are lifelong Cleveland fans, and would love to see their team in 
the playoffs for the first time since 1954. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were here Saturday and Sunday cheering for the Indians," Janice Anderson 
said, "and now we're cheering for the Angels. I've been an Indians fan all of 
my life. I knew the names and numbers, and everything, but I don't have a bit 
of trouble rooting for the Angels now." 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson was supposed to join the rotation this weekend. The Angels, however, 
instead decided they want him to pitch on the side once before joining the 
rotation. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 No date has been set for the makeup game, but because Cleveland already has 
four doubleheaders in the second half of the season, Cleveland Manager Mike 
Hargrove suggested Aug. 15. That would ruin the Angels' off-day between series 
with Detroit and Milwaukee. It's more likely the game will be rescheduled Sept. 
2. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Catcher Greg Myers, also on a rehabilitative assignment at Lake Elsinore, has 
a pulled muscle behind his left knee and won't be able to play again until 
Friday. . . . Reliever Scott Lewis will undergo a bone scan today to determine 
the cause of persistent pain in his right shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
 Pitcher John Farrell will be given at least one more start, the Angels decided 
Tuesday. Farrell (1-2, 9.00 ERA) is tentatively scheduled to start Monday 
against Minnesota at Anaheim Stadium. BOB NIGHTENGALE

SOFTBALL ROUNDUP; JOHNSTON PITCHES PARACLETE PAST CROSSROADS, 3-0 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jamie Johnston pitched a six-hitter, striking out six and walking three to 
lead Paraclete High to a 3-0 victory over Crossroads in a Southern Section 
Division V semifinal softball game Tuesday at Lancaster City Park. 
</P>
<P>
 The shutout was the 12th of the season for Johnston (18-5) and propelled the 
second-seeded Spirits into Saturday's championship game against Cerritos Valley 
Christian, a 3-0 winner over La Reina in the other semifinal. 
</P>
<P>
 Paraclete (20-4-5) took a 1-0 lead in the first inning on Ariena Bass' double. 
Bass later scored on a fielding error. Jessica Jackson's single added a run in 
the fourth. 
</P>
<P>
 Crossroads, the defending Division V champion, finished the season with 21-7 
record. 
</P>
<P>
 Cerritos Valley Christian 3, La Reina 0 -- Jennifer Baltruzak pitched a 
four-hitter and struck out five, but La Reina (17-10) committed four errors in 
the Division V semifinal at the Cerritos Sports Complex. 
</P>
<P>
 The Regents were held to one hit -- Sara Heiler's one-out infield single in 
the sixth -- by Suzie Schoales, who struck out 10. 
</P>
<P>
 Bishop Amat 3, Canyon 1 -- Chrissy Gil had two triples and pitched 4 1/3 
innings to lead Bishop Amat in the Southern Section Division II semifinals at 
Charter Oak High. 
</P>
<P>
 With two out in the top of the third inning, Gil (11-2) came on to pitch the 
rest of the way, allowing only one hit and striking out six. 
</P>
<P>
 Canyon finished 19-6-1.

 The 23rd annual California Cup field hockey tournament, which attracted about 
1,000 players from around the world, concluded Monday with the championship 
matches for the nine competing divisions at Moorpark College. 
</P>
<P>
 "It went real well," said Tom Harris, who founded the California Cup in 1971. 
"It's a lot better than it used to be. It's larger and a lot better organized." 
</P>
<P>
 Six teams participated in the inaugural tournament, but Harris has seen 
interest in the sport skyrocket, especially locally. This year, 78 teams 
participated in the three-day event. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a little different because there's so few playing it's like a 
brotherhood," he said. "It's growing and people are positive about it." 
</P>
<P>
 The West Van Millionaires from West Vancouver, B.C., won the gold in the super 
men's division, defeating Greenwich FHC from Stamford, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
 In the men's competitive division, the Cougars from Camarillo, won the gold 
medal, defeating the L.A. Tigers from Northridge in the championship match. 
</P>
<P>
 In the women's competitive division, the University of British Columbia won 
the gold, defeating Rigormortis of Oakland. Endangered Species from Davis, 
Calif., won the under-19 division, beating out the Hawks from Vancouver, B.C. 
</P>
<P>
 Taiwan entered three teams in the tournament and they all emerged with gold 
medals in the social, under-15 boys and under-12 mixed divisions. Two local 
teams got silver medals after losing to Taiwan -- the L.A. Tigers from 
Northridge in the social division and the Coyotes Green from Moorpark for the 
under-12 mixed division. 
</P>
<P>
 In the under-15 girls' division, the Bulldogs of Thousand Oaks won the gold, 
beating out the Cougars of Camarillo. The Bulldogs also won bronze medals in 
the under-15 boys' and under-12 mixed divisions. JEFF WONG

OH BY THE WAY, MANN STAYS UNDEFEATED; CITY SECTION TENNIS: TAFT HIGH SOPHOMORE 
IS ONE MATCH SHY OF COMPLETING A PERFECT SEASON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 He is 15 and playing his first season of varsity tennis. But so far Taft High 
sophomore Dylan Mann has made most of his high-school opponents look like 
rookies. 
</P>
<P>
 After defeating James Oh of Chatsworth, 6-1, 6-3, at the Racquet Centre in the 
semifinals of the City Section Individual championships Tuesday, Mann is one 
victory away from the title and an undefeated season. 
</P>
<P>
 In the final, Mann will play Dorsey sophomore Robert Williams, who defeated 
Bobak Morshed of Palisades, 6-4, 7-5. Williams improved his match record to 
16-0. Mann has a match record of 15-0 and was undefeated in 12 sets during the 
recent city team tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams defeated Mann, 6-2, 6-2, in an age-group tournament last January. But 
judging by Mann's performance against Oh, Thursday's 2 p.m. final might be 
different. 
</P>
<P>
 Mann broke Oh's service six times and breezed. 
</P>
<P>
 "He had a slow start and I picked up on it," Mann said. "(Oh) was missing the 
second and third ball (on rallies). I felt he wasn't warmed up. So I forced a 
much quicker pace. I was coming in on balls I normally hit on the base line." 
</P>
<P>
 With Oh nursing a bad back, Mann jumped out to a 4-0 lead in the first set. 
After Oh held serve to make it 4-1, Mann held and then broke Oh again to close 
out the set, thanks in part to a pair of double faults by Oh in the final game. 
</P>
<P>
 Oh rallied to a 2-0 lead to open the second set. Then Mann, who said he had 
lost his concentration, came charging back to break three of Oh's last four 
services. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't played much the last three weeks, and not that seriously," said Oh, 
a freshman who turned 15 in January. "My back's been healing pretty good, but 
it took about 10% of my game away. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now, (Mann is) better. I just need to get healthy and get back to my 
game." 
</P>
<P>
 Oh is now 0-4 in matches against Mann, who turns 16 on Oct. 2. Chatsworth 
Coach John Sayer downplayed Oh's injury and credited Mann. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's no excuse," Sayer said. "He's just not at Mann's level right now. 
Dylan is just a little more experienced, he hits the ball a little harder and 
has more control of his shots. But I know (Oh) will come along."

FRENCH OPEN / OTHER MATCHES; GRAF, PIERCE TO SLUG IT OUT ON CLAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLIOTT ALMOND, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Spain's clay-court specialists continued to exhibit their considerable skills 
at Roland Garros Stadium on Tuesday as second-seeded Arantxa Sanchez Vicario 
and No. 3 Conchita Martinez advanced to one of the semifinals of the French 
Open. 
</P>
<P>
 But the match with the most interest in women's tennis is Thursday's other 
semifinal, in which top-ranked Steffi Graf of Germany will face Mary Pierce of 
France in a matchup of the game's fiercest hitters. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanchez Vicario survived a tough second set and a partisan crowd to defeat 
Julie Halard of France, 6-1, 7-6 (8-6), and earn a berth against Martinez, who 
beat Sabine Hack of Germany, 2-6, 6-0, 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
 Graf defeated Ines Gorrochategui of Argentina, 6-4, 6-1, and has reached the 
semifinals of every French Open since 1987, when she won the first of her three 
titles. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 12 Pierce routed Petra Ritter of Austria, 6-0, 6-2, and has lost only six 
games in five matches. It is the best showing in the French Open during the 
open era. Andrea Jeager lost eight games to reach the semifinals in 1982, and 
Chris Evert had five losses at the U.S. Open in 1976, but played only four 
matches because of a bye. 
</P>
<P>
 Pierce, born in Montreal, raised in Florida but playing for France, already is 
ensured of moving into the top 10 for the first time when the next rankings are 
released, thereby becoming the first Frenchwoman to do so since Francoise Durr 
in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
 Against Ritter, Pierce won the first seven games before the Austrian finally 
held serve. Ritter, who had never advanced past the second round of a Grand 
Slam tournament, rallied in the fifth game to break Pierce's serve for only the 
second time in the tournament, but failed to sustain the momentum. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was a little bit nervous because I really wanted to win and do well," 
Pierce said. 
</P>
<P>
 After an uneven first set, Graf was satisfied with her game. She played 
patiently against the unheralded Argentine, and any thought of a third set was 
out of the question. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanchez Vicario knew what was coming when she played Halard on Center Court in 
the early evening. The French have not enjoyed much success in their 
tournament, so they embrace any compatriot who reaches the late rounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wasn't about to let it bother me," Sanchez Vicario said.  
</P>
<P>
 But it almost did when she allowed Halard to get into the match in the second 
set. Realizing the predicament, Sanchez Vicario went to work. 
</P>
<P>
 She did not want a third set, as Halard's play improved with each cheer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I decided to take more risks in the tiebreaker," Sanchez Vicario said. "Every 
time I was aggressive and took a risk, I won the point." 
</P>
<P>
 Sanchez Vicario believes the experience will give her confidence. That is 
something Martinez could use when the two meet Thursday. Martinez had lost in 
five consecutive French Open quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
 After dropping her first set to Hack, the thought occurred to her. "Losing in 
the quarterfinals six years in a row, I (thought), 'Oh, my God, I guess I am 
never going to pass it.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Tennis Notes 
</P>
<P>
 In today's men's quarterfinals, Alberto Berasategui of Spain will face No. 5 
Goran Ivanisevic, and Hendrik Dreekmann, 19, of Germany, will meet No. 46 
Magnus Larsson of Sweden. If Ivanisevic fails to reach the championship match, 
the tournament will have an unseeded finalist for the first time since Mikael 
Pernfors in 1986. . . . Sergi Bruguera's only other victory over Andrei 
Medvedev was in last year's French Open semifinals, also in straight sets.

GOLF / THOMAS BONK; OAKMONT TO BE ROUGH, TIGHT AND FAST FOR OPEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS BONK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The U.S. Open is a little more than two weeks away from its shrunken-fairway, 
roller-coaster-green, ball-eating-rough, four-day joy-ride through Oakmont 
Country Club near Pittsburgh. Usually, it's a blast there, except if you 
happened to be unlucky enough to lose your ball in rough that is only slightly 
shorter than every club in your bag. 
</P>
<P>
 Oakmont isn't exactly a place for the faint of heart. The U.S. Golf Assn. has 
ruled that the rough be no more than four to five inches long, a far cry from 
1983, the last time the Open was played there, when six-inch rough was standard 
and so was the complaining from the players. 
</P>
<P>
 The fairways are so narrow, you have to turn sideways to walk them. Actually, 
they are about 30 yards wide, so driving straight will be at even more of a 
premium than usual. 
</P>
<P>
 If that's not enough, there are the greens. The only thing faster are the cars 
on the Pennsylvania Turnpike, which oddly bisects the course and puts holes 
Nos. 2 through 8 on the other side of the highway. 
</P>
<P>
 It's clear that somebody is going to pay the price for these conditions. It 
has happened before. The only thing that golf admires more than a great winner 
is a great loser, and Oakmont has had its share of the latter. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, two of them are playing in this Open -- Arnold Palmer and Tom Watson. 
</P>
<P>
 Palmer, who won his only U.S. Open title in 1960 at Cherry Hills in Denver 
when his closest challenger was an amateur named Jack Nicklaus, probably could 
have won two more, in 1962 and 1973, both at Oakmont. On the final day in 1962, 
Palmer and Nicklaus were tied with five holes to play, and both parred each 
hole to finish tied, although Palmer could have ended it. He missed birdie 
putts of less than 15 feet on Nos. 14, 17 and 18. 
</P>
<P>
 Nicklaus won the playoff the next day with a 71, three strokes ahead of 
Palmer. It was Nicklaus' first Open as a professional. 
</P>
<P>
 Palmer was tied for the lead after 54 holes of the 1973 U.S. Open at three 
under par. His only problem was 26-year-old Johnny Miller, who was three over 
par and getting ready to shoot an Open-record 63 to deny Palmer again. Palmer's 
fourth round included a missed short birdie putt at No. 11 and three 
consecutive bogeys, after he looked at the scoreboard and was stunned to see 
Miller leading. 
</P>
<P>
 Watson arrived at Oakmont as the defending U.S. Open champion in 1983 and was 
well aware of what evil the course could conjure up. Watson had lost the 1978 
PGA Championship at Oakmont when he blew a five-shot lead after 54 holes -- and 
a four-shot lead with nine to play. Watson double-bogeyed No. 10, shot a 
three-over-par 38 on the back nine and lost to John Mahaffey in a playoff. 
</P>
<P>
 Then in the '83 Open, Oakmont's back nine got to Watson again. He had a 
three-shot lead with nine holes to go, but came home with another 38 and lost 
to Larry Nelson by one stroke. 
</P>

 Abandon ship? The Queen Mary Open has been around for 23 years. It's the 
tournament where such players as Fred Couples, Craig Stadler, Scott Simpson and 
Mark O'Meara made their pro debuts, but chances are it won't be back in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Doug Ives, who founded the event and remains the chairman, said the Queen Mary 
Open might ship out if he can't find a sponsor for the event, which finished 
its 1994 run Saturday at Lakewood Country Club. 
</P>
<P>
 "This isn't scare tactics, this is reality," Ives said. "I'm tired of 
subsidizing it." 
</P>
<P>
 Other players who made their pro debuts in the Queen Mary Open are Corey 
Pavin, Bob Tway, Keith Clearwater, Jay Don Blake, Duffy Waldorf, Bill Glasson 
and Dan Forsman. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only does the Queen Mary Open have a rich tradition, it also carries a 
$100,000 purse. But Ives said sponsor dollars are drying up and county fees are 
too high.

three names -- Mac O'Grady, Phil McGleno, Phil O'Grady.

ROBIN ABCARIAN: WHY PICK ON LARRY PARKER? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBIN ABCARIAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This week, the California Assembly is slated to vote on a bill that could 
purge the airwaves of commercials by people like Larry Parker. 
</P>
<P>
 Parker is the Long Beach-based personal injury attorney who vows, "I will 
fight for you," in tacky television ads that recruit folks who have been in 
accidents, people fighting insurance companies for the money they believe is 
rightfully theirs. 
</P>
<P>
 Parker spends about a million dollars a year on advertising. Obviously, he 
wouldn't be doing it if he didn't get results. 
</P>
<P>
 His techniques, and the techniques of other advertising law firms, such as 
Jacoby & Meyers, do not sit well with the California Trial Lawyers Assn. The 
CTLA is the prime mover of AB3659, sponsored by Assemblyman Paul V. Horcher 
(R-Diamond Bar), which would eviscerate the low-brow legal ads by severely 
limiting what they can show and say. 
</P>
<P>
 "If anyone looks at these ads, there is a common message," says CTLA spokesman 
Robert Forsyth. "You can make big bucks by ripping off the system (with) no 
risk at all. That is what is so bothersome about the advertising." 
</P>
<P>
 The CTLA thinks that lawyer-advertisers like Parker demean the profession. 
</P>
<P>
 "The image of the balanced scales of justice," CTLA President Douglas deVries 
says, "has given way to the image of accident victims calling their attorneys 
through toll-free numbers before calling their doctors or their loved ones." 
</P>
<P>
 Says Parker: "I am proud of the fact that I represent the little guy and the 
little gal. They don't know where to go for a lawyer. They don't have doctor 
friends and lawyer friends who can tell them." 
</P>
<P>
 Horcher says his bill, which would eliminate the TV testimonials that are the 
foundation of Parker's ad campaigns, will "clean up attorney advertising in 
California." 
</P>
<P>
 The bill will make Californians "safe" from personal injury lawyers by 
forbidding lawyers' clients from appearing in ads, by allowing only the 
attorneys to appear on screen, and by forbidding fees and rates to be described 
as "cut-rate," "lowest," "discount" or "special." (Acceptable alternatives 
would be "reasonable," "moderate" and "very reasonable.") 
</P>
<P>
 It would also require lawyers to inform consumers that they might be held 
liable for filing frivolous lawsuits. If attorneys appear in their ads, the 
bill will require them to say: "Each case is decided on its own facts and no 
one can guarantee a particular result. I can be disciplined by the State Bar 
for making any guarantees about the outcome of your case. If you file a 
meritless lawsuit, you can be sued in return. If you file a fraudulent lawsuit, 
you could go to jail." 
</P>
<P>
 The bill, Horcher says, "prohibits advertising that appeals purely to emotions 
and fears and instead promotes advertising that informs consumers of their 
legal rights." 
</P>
<P>
 "The time is now," he says, "to force some truth in advertising on some mighty 
rich lawyers. " 
</P>
<P>
 The italics are mine. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Almost every week, readers call me to complain about lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
 Not once has the situation been related to a misleading ad or a personal 
injury case. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly always it is about being ill-treated by lawyers hired to handle 
domestic breakups, property divisions, custody arrangements. 
</P>
<P>
 My callers feel screwed twice: once by the courts, once by their lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
 There is the single mother, hanging on by the skin of her teeth, raising an 
adolescent daughter. Her lawyer -- who works for one of the most reputable 
firms in the city -- failed to notify her ex-husband's employer that he owed 
thousands in back child support. The ex-husband received a large lump payment 
from the employer before moving to another continent. She got nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 There is the woman who raised her four kids virtually alone and is now 
fighting her ex-husband, who wants half the value of her home even though he 
left years ago and never contributed to its upkeep. Her attorney seems to have 
a substance abuse problem, has failed to pay his dues to the state bar and 
won't return her files so she can engage a new lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
 Who's fighting for them? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Consumers deserve protection when they deal with attorneys. But this law is 
too extreme. 
</P>
<P>
 Telling people they can be sued if they bring frivolous lawsuits, for 
instance, is not a bad idea. But why scare them with talk of jail? 
</P>
<P>
 And why prevent lawyers from showing off clients who have prevailed in legal 
fights? 
</P>
<P>
 And if consumers really need the "protections" of the Horcher bill, where are 
the injured parties? 
</P>
<P>
 Why doesn't the CTLA produce a client who has been harmed by an 
advertiser-attorney? 
</P>
<P>
 I'd be a whole lot more convinced that this isn't a fight over a limited 
client pool -- and dollars -- if we had proof. 
</P>
<P>
 Show me the little guy or gal who's been hurt. Otherwise, leave Larry Parker 
and his tacky testimonials alone.

 One day, while a lonely Adam was walking among the flowers in the Garden of 
Eden, he asked God for a companion. God said he would create Woman for him, 
that she would be beautiful and loving, prepare all his meals and clean up 
after him, obey Adam's every command and never question them, never talk back 
to him or treat him badly. 
</P>
<P>
 Adam was joyous because it was everything he ever wanted. God told Adam, 
however, that such a companion would cost him an arm and a leg. 
</P>
<P>
 Caught off guard by this, Adam paused and thought for a minute. Finally, he 
replied:

 A little time off to stay home with her newborn daughter seemed reasonable to 
Mary Mannix Meister. Her employer, the Philadelphia Gas Works, thought 
otherwise.Six weeks of maternity leave was all she was entitled to, the company 
said, denying her request for six more weeks off with no pay. 
</P>
<P>
 Meister stewed for a year about the travails of working parents. Then, about a 
year ago, she set up the National Coalition of Working Parents, a nonprofit 
group. Its mission statement says the organization is determined to "raise the 
consciousness of corporate America as to the importance of setting pro-family 
policies, and enhance the quality of life of working parents and their 
children."

<P>
 National Coalition of Working Parents, P.O. Box 631553, Philadelphia, Pa. 
19114-0853. Black Children Look to Family for Role Models 
</P>
<P>
 Most African American children find their heroes not among athletes or 
entertainers but in their own families, according to a poll commissioned by the 
Children's Defense Fund and the Black Community Crusade for Children. 
Eighty-three percent of those surveyed named their parents, grandparents, 
siblings, aunts and uncles as role models. Religious leaders were mentioned, 
second only to relatives, as having the greatest influence on black youngsters. 
Anti-Illiteracy Group Adds to Its Services 
</P>
<P>
 Basic Adult Spanish Education is a nonprofit organization founded in Southern 
California in 1987 to combat illiteracy among Latinos. It has 25 learning 
centers and recently added a Spanish-language child-care manual to its menu of 
services. Topics include the baby-sitter, choosing a nanny, children's rights, 
pregnancy, nutrition, feeding, hygiene and illness. For more information, call 
(818) 348-4771.

MEDIA MONITOR: '90S FAMILY; THE TRIALS OF SINGLE PARENTHOOD

 What's Playing: "South Central," a half-hour drama on the Fox network.

 Family Portrait: Joan Mosely is a single mother, raising two teen-age children 
and a young, troubled foster son. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Backstory: Joan maintains a close and loving family despite the obstacles of 
life in a sometimes tough neighborhood. She has overcome unemployment and now 
works at a neighborhood food co-op. But there is a hole in Joan's life: Stung 
by one failed relationship, she hasn't been close to a man for five years. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Fuse Time: At a party, Joan finds herself attracted to Isaiah, a contractor 
she knows from work. When Isaiah agrees to check the earthquake cracks in her 
bedroom, the visit turns into soft talk, embraces and passionate kissing. Enter 
-- unannounced -- Joan's daughter, Tasha, who recoils in anger and confusion. 
Joan's son, Andre, is equally appalled. Joan lashes back at their criticism. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Telling Quote: "You all would like it just fine if I dried up and never dated 
again," Joan shouts at the two. "Well, it's not going to happen." And yet, Joan 
tells Isaiah that she won't see him until things are calm at home. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Prescription Pad: In a perfect world, Joan would have prepared her kids for 
this massive change in her life, said Vikki S. Helperin, a retired clinical 
psychologist. "The fact that things have been this way for five years gave them 
the idea that's the way it always would be," she said. "Once a mother has been 
in charge of the kids solely, anyone seems like an intruder and an interloper. 
The idea of their mother dividing her love is intolerable. It makes them feel 
insecure."  
</P>
<P>
 That doesn't mean Joan should swear off men, however. "It's time for her to 
take care of her," Helperin said. But she applauded Joan's decision to throttle 
down the fast-moving relationship. Things were moving too fast. "Not just for 
the kids, but for her," she said.

 MEN ONLY: Catholic bishops rarely disagree publicly with the Pope. And Bishop 
Norman F. McFarland of the Orange diocese wants it clear where he stands on 
Pope John Paul's latest decree against women priests. . . . The bishop has 
issued a news release stating: "I welcome this explicit reiteration of the 
constant 2,000-year teaching of the Church." He adds that it's an issue "about 
which some people have become confused or uncertain." 
</P>
<P>
 FED-EX THIS: You think Orange County is famous for Disneyland? The Angels? Its 
conservatives? When city of Orange police officers arrived last week in Quincy, 
in Northern California, to pick up murder suspect Edward Morgan, the sheriff's 
deputies there asked: "Where's the double-doubles?" Meaning In-N-Out Burgers, 
headquartered in Irvine. . . . To thank their northern counterparts, the local 
officers have made plans to deliver them 20 burgers from In-N-Out. No easy 
task: The closest available was in Modesto -- three hours away from Quincy. 
</P>
<P>
 HIS DAY: When American troops landed on the beaches of Normandy 50 years ago, 
Tom Moon of Orange was flying behind enemy lines in Burma for the OSS 
(forerunner of the CIA). Moon, who has written two books on the OSS, leaves 
Thursday, for a European speaking tour, sponsored partly by the U.S. Army. His 
six speeches one the war include one at Normandy on D-day, June 6. Says Moon: 
"I know that it's going to be greatly moving: What happened there was a 
slaughter." 
</P>
<P>
 TRUCKING ALONG: In tough times, some cities will do almost anything to make a 
buck -- even close off part of a very busy Harbor Boulevard. . . . Fullerton 
will close off one northbound lane of Harbor between Santa Fe and Wilshire 
avenues for most of today. Reason: A film crew is shooting a truck commercial. 
"The city views this as economic development," says spokeswoman Sylvia Mudrick. 
The film company had to pay $55 for a local business license, pay for the 
traffic officers, and is also spending a few bucks around town.

 NEW HISTORY: It was some irony when the quake, the biggest event to ever hit 
the Cal State Northridge campus, halted the sale of Prof. John Broesamle's book 
about the school's history, "Suddenly a Giant." Copies were trapped in the 
damaged library and weren't put on sale again until last week. . . . Broesamle, 
however, doesn't mind missing this latest chapter: "Historians don't do 
breaking stories." 
</P>
<P>
 RESPECT: For years, mystery writers didn't give the Valley much respect. Well, 
no more. Thanks to former Times Valley Edition reporter Michael Connelly's 
acclaimed new book, "The Concrete Blonde," the Valley certainly gets its share 
of literary blood and guts. . . . "Whatever a mystery writer is looking for," 
Connelly says, "you can find it in the Valley. It's more untouched ground than 
West L. A., and provides the same kind of intrigue." 
</P>
<P>
 TARZANA: There's much more to Tarzana than Edgar Rice Burroughs and the legend 
of Tarzan. For example, this is a community with a bustling shopping and dining 
zone along Ventura Boulevard, and plenty of quiet and attractive neighborhoods. 
. . . Burroughs' grandson, Danton Burroughs (above), still keeps very close 
ties to Tarzana (B5). 
</P>
<P>
 MORMONS: This is a special time for the 35,000 Mormons in the San Fernando, 
Santa Clarita and Antelope valleys. That's because it looks like ex-Los 
Angeles-area attorney Howard W. Hunter will replace Mormon Church President 
Ezra Taft Benson, who died Monday. . . . Hunter, says Tad Callister, the 
Church's Valley spokesman, "has a personal interest" in Mormon growth here. 
</P>
<P>
 BRIBERY: Many parents pay their kids for good grades. Why not? It works, 
doesn't it? Yes and no. According to Adele Gottfried, a Cal State Northridge 
professor, cash incentives eventually backfire (E3). . . . "They're being 
trained to expect something else rather than the achievements themselves," she 
said. "What happens when the rewards run out? Where's the motivation?" Michael 
Arkush

FABRIZIO MANCINELLI; SUPERVISED RESTORATION OF SISTINE FRESCOES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fabrizio Mancinelli, 54, who oversaw the restoration of the Michelangelo 
frescoes in the Sistine Chapel of the Vatican. Officially, Mancinelli was 
director of Byzantine, medieval and modern art for the Vatican Museums.But, as 
an expert on the works of Michelangelo, he was asked to supervise the cleaning 
and restoration of biblical scenes in the chapel where popes are elected. The 
project took 14 years and was completed only a couple of months ago. Mancinelli 
staunchly defended the undertaking against claims by some art historians that 
the newly revealed bright colors violated the somber and subtle work of 
Michelangelo. Mancinelli also disputed the popular idea that the artist had 
painted the frescoes while lying on his back on scaffolding. On Sunday in Rome 
of pancreatic cancer.

17 ARRESTED IN PROBE OF MOB TIES TO LOUISIANA POKER MACHINES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Months before the first coins fell into a Louisiana video poker machine two 
years ago, federal and state investigators already were checking organized 
crime figures. 
</P>
<P>
 Their probe resulted in the arrests Tuesday of 17 people accused of using a 
video poker company to skim profits for the Marcello, Genovese and Gambino 
crime families in Louisiana and New York. 
</P>
<P>
 "Will organized crime attempt to infiltrate legal gaming in the United States? 
The answer, according to this indictment, unfortunately, is yes," said Neil 
Gallagher, FBI special agent in charge of Louisiana. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities would not estimate how much money the alleged scheme netted. About 
14,000 video poker machines are operating in Louisiana bars, restaurants, truck 
stops, racetracks and off-track betting parlors. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said the investigation was continuing. They would not say if it is 
crossing over into an investigation of Louisiana's new casino gambling 
industry. Five riverboat casinos are in operation, with 10 more planned. The 
world's largest casino is expected to open in late 1995 in New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday's arrests were made in Louisiana, New York and Florida on the basis of 
a sealed indictment handed up Friday following a 2 1/2-year investigation by 
the FBI and Louisiana State Police. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those arrested were Anthony Carollo, identified by the indictment as 
current boss of the Marcello crime family. 
</P>
<P>
 The racketeering charges allege that the Genovese and Gambino families aided 
the Marcello family in establishing and controlling Worldwide Gaming of 
Louisiana and its subsidiary, Louisiana Route Operators Inc., which distributed 
video gaming machines. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the indictment, Worldwide Gaming secured the sole rights in 
Louisiana to video poker machines made by industry giant Bally Gaming Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Atty. Robert Boitmann said Bally Gaming was the victim of the scheme and 
cooperated with investigators. 
</P>
<P>
 Bally agreed to furnish Worldwide Gaming about $20 million worth of credit, 
cash and machines, the indictment said. Money from the machines, which could 
have been used to repay Bally, was diverted illegally to the crime families, 
the grand jury alleged.

<TEXT>
<P>
 A man who was trapped upside-down in a pile of boulders for 10 hours was 
rescued by firefighters who had to dig underneath the rocks with their hands. 
</P>
<P>
 Francis Queenan, 52, of Marlboro suffered cuts and bruises and was in fair 
condition Tuesday at University of Massachusetts Medical Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said Queenan apparently was reaching into the pile behind a department 
store Monday and slid in about 6 1/2 feet, head-first and at a 45-degree angle. 
</P>
<P>
 He was stuck for about eight hours before anyone saw him and called rescuers. 
</P>
<P>
 Wedged between cold boulders up to eight feet in diameter, Queenan was showing 
signs of hypothermia as rescuers freed him, said Fire Capt. Jim Diamond.

WARNER TO BACK INDEPENDENT'S BID IF NORTH IS GOP NOMINEE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From The Washington Post 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sen. John W. Warner (R-Va.) says he will actively support an independent 
Senate bid by fellow Republican J. Marshall Coleman if Oliver L. North wins the 
GOP nomination Saturday, and he may even renounce the party by seeking 
reelection in 1996 as an independent. 
</P>
<P>
 Virginia's senior senator said he has been encouraging Coleman, a former state 
attorney general, to mount an independent campaign because he believes North is 
unfit to hold public office. 
</P>
<P>
 And although Warner has made no final decision, he said he will not allow 
conservatives who support North to prevent him from running again in two years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I will find a way of getting my name in front of the voters of Virginia," he 
said. "I hope to do it through the party structure. But a small, tiny group is 
not going to stop me." 
</P>
<P>
 Warner, the highest-ranking elected Republican in Virginia, will not attend 
the party convention in Richmond this weekend. He will be on the beaches of 
Normandy for ceremonies commemorating the 50th anniversary of D-day. He said 
one GOP activist recently joked to him: "You're going where the shooting has 
stopped." 
</P>
<P>
 Warner's blunt remarks are the clearest sign yet that the ideological schism 
caused by North's candidacy likely will widen in coming months. The prospect of 
a Warner defection in two years could shatter the party unity fostered by 
Republican Gov. George F. Allen's unexpected victory last fall and throw 
Republicans into an internecine war. 
</P>
<P>
 There also is evidence that Warner commands a much stronger political position 
than the hail of criticism directed at him in recent weeks would suggest. 
</P>
<P>
 Although GOP conservatives are furious with him for disparaging North, senior 
Republicans and Democrats say Warner's popularity with the general public has 
soared because of his stand. Political strategists say numerous private polls 
show that most voters consider his statements gutsy. Warner's current approval 
ratings are the highest of any elected official in Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
 Political analysts said that even though Coleman has lost two statewide races 
since he was elected attorney general in 1977, an energetic effort by Warner 
could help make him a serious contender.

2 DISTRICTS SIGN UP FOR FREE MEALS FOR YOUTHS; SCHOOLS: VENTURA AND OCEAN VIEW 
HAVE APPLIED TO THE FEDERAL PROJECT, WHICH SERVES NEEDY STUDENTS OVER THE 
SUMMER. 
</P>

<P>
 Concerned that needy children are going hungry during the summer, the Ventura 
and Ocean View school districts have signed up for a federal program to serve 
free lunches to students while they are out of school. 
</P>
<P>
 But federal officials say many Ventura County students still go hungry because 
not enough local agencies have stepped up to run summer food programs. 
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Paula and Fillmore school districts, the Ventura County 
superintendent of schools' migrant education program and California Lutheran 
University in Thousand Oaks already serve federally funded free lunches to 
1,800 needy children each summer. 
</P>
<P>
 School officials in Ventura and the Ocean View district in Oxnard said they 
expect to provide meals to an additional 1,100 children, bringing the total in 
the county to about 2,900. 
</P>
<P>
 But federal officials say there are 36,674 school-age children who qualify 
during the school year for free or reduced-price lunches, which is the criteria 
for students to receive the summer meals. 
</P>
<P>
 That means that Ventura County is providing the free summer meals to only 7.9% 
of the children who are eligible, slightly trailing the statewide average of 
8%. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need more school districts, we need more public and private agencies" 
willing to sponsor the food program, said Cleophus Davis, western regional 
director of the summer feeding program for the U. S. Department of Agriculture. 
"The same children who are eligible for free and reduced meals during the year 
are no less hungry when school is out." 
</P>
<P>
 The Department of Agriculture launched the summer food program in the late 
1960s as an extension of the federal free-and-reduced lunch program. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the federal government reimburses agencies $2.28 for each meal 
served, the program sponsors must operate efficiently enough not to spend more 
than they receive. 
</P>
<P>
 "With prudent management, you can break even," Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the promise of reimbursement, some county school districts with high 
numbers of needy children have never applied for the federal program. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Oxnard Elementary School District, for example, all but 1,500 of the 
7,500 students who eat cafeteria lunches would qualify for free lunches in the 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard school officials said they have considered the program but are looking 
for local clubs or community sites where the meals could be served. In the 
Ventura Unified School District, the meals will be prepared at school 
cafeterias but served at community centers and Boys & Girls Clubs in areas with 
high numbers of needy families. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those areas that we're serving, they're all considered a high-need area," 
said Edward Diaz, the district's food services director. "If we don't feed 
those kids a lunch, many of them will not get a lunch." 
</P>
<P>
 The lunches will consist of the usual school fare. 
</P>
<P>
 On June 20, the first day of Ventura's summer lunch program, the menu calls 
for pizza, fresh fruit, tossed salad and milk. 
</P>
<P>
 Although such nutritionally balanced meals may generate less excitement in 
children than, say, a trip to McDonald's, Ventura school officials said they 
expect up to 1,000 children to take advantage of the free meals each day. 
</P>
<P>
 In Santa Paula, where the elementary school district launched the program just 
last summer, organizers said they served an average of 581 lunches per day. The 
county's program for children of migrant workers feeds about 500 students daily 
during the summer. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fillmore Unified School District provides the free summer lunches to about 
542 children each day. The Cal Lutheran Upward Bound program serves the meals 
to 40 students daily, and the Ocean View district estimates that it will 
provide lunches to about 90 students. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though the federal program is intended only for children from low-income 
families, students are not asked to present identification or proof that they 
qualify, organizers said. Only people who are clearly over 18 years of age are 
turned away. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers of the Santa Paula summer lunch program said they refused meals to 
some homeless adults last summer. But school officials said they still served 
far more lunches each day than they had anticipated: On some days, nearly 800 
children showed up for the free meals. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the children come from homes where both parents work long hours to 
support their families, leaving the youngsters to fend for themselves during 
the day. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were really surprised at the turnout," said Sandy Cortinas, assistant food 
services director for the Santa Paula Elementary School District. "A lot of 
these kids really needed a lunch." FYI 
</P>
<P>
 The Ventura Unified School District will begin providing free lunches June 20 
at the following locations: Westpark Recreation Center, 450 W. Harrison St.; 
Cabrillo Village Community Center, in Cabrillo Village off of Saticoy Avenue; 
the Boys & Girls Club, 1440 N. Olive St., and the Boys & Girls Club, 1929 
Johnson Drive. For information, call the district at 641-1500.

VENTURA POLICE TARGETING REPEAT PARKING VIOLATORS; CRACKDOWN: PLAN CALLS FOR 
TOWING VEHICLES WITH FIVE OR MORE UNPAID TICKETS. MORE THAN $94,000 IS OWED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Cracking down on parking scofflaws, Ventura police announced plans Tuesday to 
start towing away vehicles with five or more unpaid tickets. 
</P>
<P>
 Police will aggressively track down such vehicles and impound them at the 
owner's expense, said Ventura Police Cpl. John Turner, who is overseeing the 
crackdown. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you owe money, you owe money," Turner said. "It's not fair for me to 
accept money from someone who is paying their fine and not go after people who 
don't." 
</P>
<P>
 As of April 30, the city recorded 155 vehicles with five or more unpaid 
parking tickets, for a total of more than $94,000 in fines owed, Turner said. 
</P>
<P>
 With the new initiative -- known as the Delinquent Repeat Offender Program -- 
Ventura police will become the most aggressive law enforcement agency in the 
county in going after repeat parking violators, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ventura County Sheriff's Department and the Oxnard and Simi Valley police 
departments rarely impound cars and typically send notices to the Department of 
Motor Vehicles when parking offenders don't pay up. The state agency puts a 
lien against the vehicle, and the offender cannot re-register it until the 
ticket is paid. 
</P>
<P>
 That has been Ventura's procedure, Turner said. In interviews a few years ago, 
Ventura police officials said the city's illegal parking problem was not 
serious enough to warrant tracking down parking violators. 
</P>
<P>
 But Ventura police decided to abandon that policy after a state law went into 
effect last year allowing cities to tow away vehicles with multiple citations. 
</P>
<P>
 "I spent nearly a year placing DMV holds, sending out late notices, using a 
softer approach," Turner said. "Now we're going after the repeat offenders." 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura City Atty. Peter D. Bulens conceded that towing cars is a "drastic 
solution, but we haven't solved the problem any other way." 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura officials said summer is a particularly bad time for the county's 
coastal cities, which are inundated with out-of-town vacationers who often 
ignore parking laws. 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard Police Sgt. George Pultz hailed Ventura's tougher approach but said 
tracking down the offending vehicles won't be easy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes they're hard to find," Pultz said. "They're not that easy to 
locate. I wish them the best of luck." 
</P>
<P>
 Turner said he will have five police officers conducting periodic sweeps. He 
declined to say when police will start having cars towed because he does not 
want to alert residents who might hide their cars in a garage. 
</P>
<P>
 "It could be tomorrow morning or next week," he said Tuesday. "I want to leave 
it as nebulous as possible." 
</P>
<P>
 But Turner did say at least one sweep will be finished by the end of next 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 Each offender targeted for the sweep has received at least three notices, plus 
a letter from Turner warning that the car might be impounded. Turner said he 
decided to go after repeat offenders from 1991 to the present. 
</P>
<P>
 Police plan to hold the cars until payments are received. If unclaimed, the 
vehicles will be sold by one of the city's three tow companies. 
</P>
<P>
 Turner said he doesn't expect that everyone whose car is impounded to cough up 
the money, although payment plans can be arranged. 
</P>
<P>
 "They'll look at how much they owe, and they'll look at their car and wave 
goodby," Turner said. 
</P>
<P>
 The worst offender in the city, who has 15 tickets and whose vehicle is 
unregistered, owes about $2,800 in parking fines, Turner said. 
</P>
<P>
 Money generated by the parking fines will go into the city's general fund.

FROM WEED PATCH TO WORLD-CLASS SOCCER VENUE; OXNARD: COMMUNITY PROJECT 
CULMINATES THURSDAY WITH DEDICATION. TEAM FROM CAMEROON WILL USE FACILITY AS 
PRACTICE SITE.

<P>
 Six acres at Oxnard College that once boasted wildflowers and mustard plants 
will be dedicated Thursday as Ventura County's premier soccer venue, a patch of 
ground that later this month will host a World Cup contender. 
</P>
<P>
 Soccer goals borrowed from Moorpark College are to be installed today, and the 
end lines and other markings will be painted onto the newly laid Bermuda sod 
later this week. 
</P>
<P>
 It has been a months-long community project fusing thousands of hours of 
volunteerism with the limited resources of the city and the college. 
</P>
<P>
 But it will pay off Tuesday when the team from the African nation of Cameroon 
arrives to begin practicing for the world's most popular sporting event, the 
soccer tournament that pits the best 24 teams in the world against each other. 
</P>
<P>
 Sniffing around for Southern California practice fields, World Cup officials 
approached Oxnard leaders last year about turning the weed patch behind the 
college's gymnasium into a world-class training site. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oxnard is a unique story because at the time we visited the facility, they 
didn't have a field at all," said Frank Rojas, the competition director of 
World Cup Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The facility "is going to be a tremendous legacy for the college and all the 
soccer players in Ventura County," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 When the campus was chosen as a practice site earlier this year, college 
officials said they would need help from the soccer community and a one-time, 
$20,000 grant from the Oxnard City Council to finish the fields in time for 
training. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers borrowed tractors and a land plane to level the ground, installed 
an irrigation system, sped construction of the $4-million gymnasium and 
mobilized hundreds of volunteers to complete the project. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was just a patch of ground behind our gym," college spokeswoman Cathy 
Garnica said. "They had to completely level the area where the soccer fields 
are and put in a layer of mulch and mushroom compost. 
</P>
<P>
 "People just gave us their best possible materials and services to make it all 
possible because they really believed they could make Oxnard shine," Garnica 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Garnica said the improvements would have cost more than $165,000 without the 
donated time and materials. 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard College Coach Jorge Brescia, himself a former professional soccer 
player in Argentina, said the new fields would far outlive the two weeks they 
will be used by the Cameroon team. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to have more people wanting to play soccer here because we have 
better facilities," said Brescia, whose teams until now have played on the 
football field. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like a carpet, it's so incredible," Brescia said of the new fields. "If 
you cannot play good soccer there, it's because you are not a good soccer 
player." 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Manuel M. Lopez, who will be on hand at Thursday's 5:45 p.m. dedication, 
said hosting the team from Cameroon will boost the local economy by bringing 
tourist dollars to the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "They should give us some good, positive publicity," Lopez said. "The fact 
that the World Cup is such a worldwide event should help, too." 
</P>
<P>
 But according to Rojas, the practices may be held behind closed doors. "It's 
up to the coach on how he wants to handle that," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cameroon is a French-speaking country of about 10 million people situated on 
the western coast of Africa. Its 1990 World Cup team made it to the 
quarter-finals before losing to England. 
</P>
<P>
 "They really captivated the hearts of the world," Rojas said of the 1990 team. 
"They played a very colorful game and they stunned the world when they beat 
Argentina." 
</P>
<P>
 The 1994 team will practice daily at Oxnard College through June 19, when it 
opens against Sweden at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 At Soccer Plus in Ventura, Jon Hopkins is selling T-shirts touting the 
Cameroon team for $14.95. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people are interested in buying them so they can take them down and 
have them signed," Hopkins said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hopkins said both his employees and customers are excited about the World Cup, 
which begins officially June 17. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have people coming in all the time saying they just got tickets," Hopkins 
said. "They can't wait for it to start. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got mine to see Cameroon play Sweden," he added. "I'm going to be down 
there dancing with all the Cameroonians." FYI 
</P>
<P>
 The two new soccer fields at Oxnard College will be officially dedicated 
Thursday at a 5:45 p.m. ceremony at the campus. The World Cup soccer team from 
the African nation of Cameroon is scheduled to arrive Tuesday and practice 
daily through June 19. The team will begin tournament play against Sweden in a 
game to be held at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena.

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: FIRE HAZARDS CHECK TO BE CONDUCTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HADLY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Firefighters will be patrolling Ventura County neighborhoods starting today to 
check if residents have cleared potential fire hazards by cutting back brush 
and grass around their homes. 
</P>
<P>
 For the past 20 years, the county has required that wild grass and brush be 
removed from within 100 feet of structures.Fire officials say the strict codes 
helped save hundreds of homes that could have burned in last year's firestorm. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no doubt that we would have lost more structures without the code," 
said Terry Raley, the wild-land fire officer for the Ventura County Fire 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Raley said 9% of the 20,000 residences in the county complied with the rules 
last year. This year, he expects 99% compliance. 
</P>
<P>
 "With last year's fires, people are more aware of the hazard and will likely 
follow through with clearing the fire hazards," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents who don't comply with the fire codes will be given one warning; if 
the hazards are not cleared within five days of that warning, the Fire 
Department will clear the hazard and charge the homeowner for the work. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the cost of clearing the area, which averages about $800, the 
Fire Department will charge a $221 administrative fee for processing the code 
violation, Raley said. SCOTT HADLY

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: NEWBURY PARK; MAN GETS 7 YEARS ON DRUG CHARGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DWAYNE BRAY

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A convicted Newbury Park drug dealer was sentenced Tuesday to seven years in 
prison -- the maximum term -- by a judge who last month refused to let 
prosecutors retry the man on charges of assaulting a police officer. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County Superior Court Judge Charles R. McGrath sentenced Jeffrey 
Hedlund to five years for one count of transportation and sale of cocaine, one 
year for one count of drug possession and one year for committing another crime 
while having a prior felony conviction. 
</P>
<P>
 Hedlund tried to run over Ventura County Sheriff's Deputy Patrick MacCauley on 
June 30 after realizing that a man to whom he had just sold cocaine was a 
police informant, according to court testimony. 
</P>
<P>
 But a jury in March deadlocked 7 to 5 in favor of convicting Hedlund on two 
charges of assault on a police officer in connection with his June 30 arrest.  
</P>
<P>
 The same jury convicted him of trafficking drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors wanted to retry Hedlund on the assault charges, but McGrath 
refused their request. 
</P>
<P>
 Jurors had told the judge that they did not believe that prosecutors had 
enough evidence to get assault convictions against Hedlund. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Robert Meyers said he was pleased that Hedlund received the 
maximum penalty for the drug offenses. 
</P>
<P>
 He said Hedlund drove recklessly and put the lives of residents and deputies 
in danger when he tried to evade arrest. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm pleased with the sentence because the defendant's conduct was so 
aggravated," Meyers said. DWAYNE BRAY

 Every week, Larry Lewis salvages 3,000 wire shirt hangers. Every few months, 
he dumps 100 pounds worth of old invoices into the recycling bin.And every day, 
he saves dozens of plastic bags. 
</P>
<P>
 Such painstaking conservation efforts earned Lewis' workplace, the Westlake 
Village Cleaners, one of Thousand Oaks' 1994 Waste Watch awards. 
</P>
<P>
 And Lewis plans to display the honor prominently, as part of his ongoing 
effort to woo new customers by emphasizing his environment-friendly practices. 
</P>
<P>
 "It costs a little more, but customers really pay attention," Lewis said.  
</P>
<P>
 "We have gained a lot of customers because people know we recycle. This 
recognition should be beneficial." 
</P>
<P>
 Westlake Village Cleaners won the city award in the waste reduction category, 
for recycling clothes hangers, plastic bags, invoice slips and cardboard boxes. 
</P>
<P>
 Other winners in that category were biotechnology giant Amgen and the Body 
Shop, which sells bath lotions and cosmetics. 
</P>
<P>
 In other categories, the city honored Lindsay Jackson Designs for reusing 
materials at work, and bestowed gold medals for recycling on Corlund 
Electronics, the Tri-Valley Environmental Committee and Pep Boys.  
</P>
<P>
 Mrs. Gooch's Natural Foods Market won for consistently buying recycled 
products. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is important to recognize business and nonprofit agencies for their 
efforts to reduce waste," Mayor Elois Zeanah said.  
</P>
<P>
 "Every little bit helps." 
</P>
<P>
 Those interested in more information about effective waste reduction can call 
the city's Recycling Hotline at 496-8679. STEPHANIE SIMON

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: ARRAIGNMENT DELAYED FOR D. A., INVESTIGATOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A judge postponed an arraignment Tuesday for a prosecutor and district 
attorney's investigator charged with felony eavesdropping so that a motion to 
dismiss the case can be heard. 
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court Judge Lawrence Storch set a hearing for June 8 to determine the 
validity of the eavesdropping charge against Ventura County Deputy Dist. 
Atty.Stacy A. Ratner, a seven-year prosecutor, and Investigator Katherine 
Smith. 
</P>
<P>
 Ratner and Smith have been on paid administrative leave since May 20, when the 
state attorney general's office charged them in what is believed to be the 
county's first felony case against an active prosecutor and investigator. They 
each face up to three years in state prison if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
 The attorney general's investigation began after a court bailiff accused 
Ratner and Smith of conspiring to eavesdrop on a Jan. 19 conversation between a 
burglary defendant and his defense attorney at the Hall of Justice. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Lee Morrow, 30, was talking privately to Deputy Public Defender Mary 
Fielder in a holding cell adjacent to a fourth-floor courtroom when Ratner, 34, 
allegedly ordered Smith to listen to the conversation through a door that was 
ajar. 
</P>
<P>
 The charge was filed under a Penal Code section that prohibits law enforcement 
agencies from using electronic or mechanical devices to eavesdrop. Defense 
attorneys Tuesday asked Storch to consider dropping the charges because their 
clients are not accused of using such devices. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles attorney Harland W. Braun replaced Ratner's original lawyer on the 
case, James M. Farley of Ventura. Braun most recently helped get former Los 
Angeles Police Officer Theodore Briseno cleared on charges of beating motorist 
Rodney G. King. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Ratner nor Smith appeared in court Tuesday. The attorney general's 
office excused them because of the postponement. DWAYNE BRAY

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: RIVAL'S COMPLAINT TARGETS INCUMBENT

 A rival candidate has filed a complaint against Ventura County's appointed 
incumbent Auditor-Controller Thomas O. Mahon, questioning Mahon's authority to 
sign county audit reports. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott A. Weiss, a Ventura resident and certified public accountant, filed the 
complaint last week with the state Board of Accountancy.He alleges that Mahon 
cannot legally sign his name to county-performed audits because he is not a 
certified public accountant. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with his complaint, Weiss submitted a copy of a 1993 audit of the 
county's treasury office that includes Mahon's signature. 
</P>
<P>
 "He doesn't have the legal authority to issue an audit," said Weiss, one of 
four candidates challenging Mahon for the auditor's job in Tuesday's election. 
</P>
<P>
 Mahon, who was appointed auditor last year by the Board of Supervisors after 
serving 20 years as assistant auditor, said that while he is not a certified 
public accountant, regulations outlined in the state government code permit him 
to sign off on all county audits. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess when you're desperate, you'll grab at anything," Mahon said of Weiss. 
</P>
<P>
 Larry Knapp, an official with the state Board of Accountancy, said he could 
not comment on the case. He said he did not know when his office would be able 
to finish its investigation into Weiss' complaint. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Mahon is not a certified public accountant, he meets the legal 
requirements of the job because he has served as assistant auditor for more 
than three years. 
</P>
<P>
 Mahon said that if a problem arises with his signing of department audits, he 
would simply have someone else in his office sign them. 
</P>
<P>
 Weiss said he believes that the auditor-controller should be required by law 
to be a certified public accountant. CARLOS V. LOZANO

<P>
 The California Highway Patrol arrested 28 suspected drunken drivers in Ventura 
County over the Memorial Day weekend, down from 40 arrests last year, officials 
said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, one person died in a drunk-driving accident, but there were no 
fatalities over this year's 78-hour maximum enforcement period that began at 6 
p.m. Friday and ended at midnight Monday, CHP Officer Staci Morse said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a good weekend," Morse said. "The awareness level is starting to 
elevate among people." 
</P>
<P>
 Morse said heightened media coverage and ongoing educational programs have 
caused more residents to avoid drinking and driving, and to use designated 
drivers. PEGGY Y. LEE

 Ventura fire officials are investigating the cause of a suspicious brush fire 
that broke out Tuesday north of Hillcrest Drive, near Catalina Street. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura Battalion Chief Bill Rigg said investigators could not find remnants 
of a cigarette or any other accidental cause of the blaze that consumed about 
three-quarters of an acre. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one was even in the area when the fire began," Rigg said. 
</P>
<P>
 Firefighters were called about 1:45 p.m., and had the blaze under control in 
about 10 minutes, authorities said. No one was injured, Rigg said. PEGGY Y. LEE

<TEXT>
<P>
 After noticing a surge of thefts at local grocery stores, Santa Paula police 
are warning shoppers against thieves who are taking wallets from shopping 
carts. 
</P>
<P>
 "I noticed that we had about a dozen in the last four to six months," police 
Sgt. Gary Marshall said. 
</P>
<P>
 Typically the thief waits for the victim to become distracted with shopping 
duties before taking the wallet, Marshall said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're pretty slick. No one's ever seen anyone around their cart or 
anything," Marshall said. Police have no suspects in the thefts, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Marshall advises carrying handbags on shoulders, and remembering to keep them 
zipped closed. He also advocates shopping with a friend or using fanny packs to 
make it more difficult for thieves. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's just part of an everyday awareness of your environment," 
Marshall said. "People need to be a little more alert and attentive to detail."

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA PAULA; SCHOOL WON'T BE RENAMED FOR LATINO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After hearing public testimony, the Santa Paula school board decided that Glen 
City School should not be renamed for a current Latino school board member. 
</P>
<P>
 Trustees Wannette Jauregui and Janet Grant voted in favor of a motion to leave 
the elementary school's name unchanged, while trustee Gene Marzec voted against 
the measure.Marzec supported a rival proposal to change the name to Joe Bravo 
School. 
</P>
<P>
 Bravo, a current trustee on the board, abstained from voting at Thursday's 
meeting, as did trustee Benjamin Saiz. Saiz did not explain his reason for 
abstaining, said Bob Borrego, a community activist who proposed the name 
change. 
</P>
<P>
 Saiz was not available for comment Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Jauregui and Grant have said they received many letters urging them not to 
change the name of the school and that influenced their decision. 
</P>
<P>
 Borrego said he underestimated the sentimental attachment that many longtime 
Santa Paula residents have to the name Glen City School. Santa Paula was once 
referred to as Glen City. 
</P>
<P>
 "I raised the issue and explained the reasons why I felt it would be good for 
the school district," Borrego said Friday. "But a lot of people just didn't 
want it changed." 
</P>
<P>
 Borrego said he suggested the name change so that Santa Paula'a Latino youth 
would have a positive role model to look up. Besides being a school board 
trustee, Bravo is a former mayor of the city and a native son. 
</P>
<P>
 About 60% of the tiny city's residents are Latino. 
</P>
<P>
 "Santa Paula is a strange community," Borrego said. "People like to think it 
is a friendly, quaint community. But there is another part of the population 
that is always ignored, and that is the Latinos." KAY SAILLANT

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: LOS PADRES FOREST; VEHICLES RESTRICTED AT 3 
CAMPGROUNDS

<P>
 Alarmed by the damage done to sensitive and endangered wildlife, the U. S. 
Forest Service has restricted the use of cars and camping vehicles at three 
campgrounds in the mountains beyond Ojai and Piru. 
</P>
<P>
 The vehicles are literally running over several species of native creatures 
that flourish in the streams and woodlands of Los Padres National 
Forest.National forest officials say they have seen a noticeable decline in 
populations of the western pond turtle, red-legged frog, arroyo toad and 
two-striped garter snake, all candidates to be listed as endangered species. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we didn't close the area to vehicles, chances are (the California 
Department of) Fish and Game would have us shut down the entire campground," 
said Leslie Jehnings, recreational planner for the Ojai Ranger District. 
</P>
<P>
 Rangers have banned vehicles until Oct. 1 from Beaver Campground off 
California 33 and Blue Point Campground above Lake Piru. Hikers and cyclists 
can still use the campsites. 
</P>
<P>
 Another 12 campsites at Lion Campground near Rose Valley will also be 
converted from drive-in to walk-in sites. In addition, rangers plan to mark 
wildlife habitats and key streams with bilingual signs in the sensitive areas, 
Jehnings said. PHYLLIS W. JORDAN

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: RINCON; CONTAMINATED WATER FOUND NEAR OIL FIELD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF McDONALD

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The company that spilled 84,000 gallons of heavy crude oil into McGrath Lake 
near Oxnard late last year has alerted water quality officials of ground-water 
contamination discovered near the company's Rincon area plant. 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter dated May 27, attorneys for Berry Petroleum told the Regional 
Water Quality Control Board that workers found traces of petroleum hydrocarbons 
in the ground water at an oil field near its Rincon plant. 
</P>
<P>
 The company's attorneys told state water officials that Berry's operations do 
not appear to have caused the contamination, which the company said appears to 
pose no health threat. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no (drinking) water basin in this area, and no beneficial use is 
made of this shallow ground water," the letter states. 
</P>
<P>
 Berry Petroleum has already retained a consultant to evaluate samples of the 
water and investigate the source of contamination. But attorney Marc L. Charney 
said that does not mean that his clients are to blame. 
</P>
<P>
 "It looks like something that couldn't have come from any Berry operation," 
Charney said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Ross of the Regional Water Quality Control Board in Monterey Park said he 
would wait for results of the consultant's report before launching an 
investigation of his own. 
</P>
<P>
 "These (incidents) are not that uncommon," said Ross, who heads the agency's 
site cleanup division. He said there is a "high potential" for impacts to 
ground water from any oil-production operation. 
</P>
<P>
 "After we see the report, then we usually conduct a field inspection," Ross 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bush Oil Co., a division of Berry Petroleum, spilled 84,000 gallons of thick 
crude into McGrath Lake near Oxnard after a pipeline burst in December. 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds of birds and other species were killed as a result of the leak, which 
is under investigation by the Ventura County district attorney. JEFF McDONALD

<P>
 In an effort to solicit community opinion on the proposed civilian-military 
joint use of the airfield at the Point Mugu Naval Air Weapons Station, the city 
of Camarillo will sponsor a series of community forums, officials announced. 
</P>
<P>
 The first forum begins at 7 p.m. Thursday at the Camarillo Springs Clubhouse, 
6358 Irena Ave. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said the forums will include a discussion of the recently released 
feasibility study by the Southern California Assn. of Governments. The study, 
which was released late last week, indicated that enough demand exists in the 
county to support a regional airport. 
</P>
<P>
 Eastern Camarillo residents in the past have expressed concern that the 
proposal would sharply increase noise in their neighborhood, which in part lies 
under Point Mugu's main flight path. 
</P>
<P>
 Other forums will be held at 7 p.m. June 15 at Camarillo City Hall, 601 Carmen 
Drive; June 20 at Las Colinas School gymnasium, 5750 Fieldcrest Drive, and July 
8 at the Camarillo Leisure Village Recreation Center, 200 Leisure Village Drive 
West.

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; HEALTH INSPECTORS CLOSE RESTAURANT 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Health inspectors temporarily closed an Oxnard restaurant after they found 
rodent droppings, cockroaches and other unsanitary conditions on the floor and 
food preparation counters, according to a county health department report. 
</P>
<P>
 The droppings were observed at El Taco de Mexico restaurant at 2515 Ventura 
Blvd. on April 7, prompting a health official to close the facility. 
</P>
<P>
 The restaurant was reopened a few hours later after the owners cleaned it, 
according to a Ventura County Environmental Health Department report. 
</P>
<P>
 The owners called a commercial pest control agency to take care of the vermin 
problem, the report said. The owners also promised to quickly repair a walk-in 
refrigerator that was not working properly. 
</P>
<P>
 Owner Manny Sanoja was not available for comment, but a cashier at El Taco de 
Mexico said the restaurant is part of a countywide chain of five restaurants 
serving Mexican food. 
</P>
<P>
 An employee who refused to give her name said parts of the report were 
inaccurate. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a fumigator come in, and he wrote a report saying there was no 
cockroach infestation," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 She said that the owner had voluntarily closed the restaurant for a few hours 
to clean up, and that it was not closed by health inspectors. KAY SAILLANT

SHERIFF'S PLAN TABS SENIORS IN CRIME FIGHT; THOUSAND OAKS: VOLUNTEERS MAY BE 
USED TO CHECK ON THE HOMES OF VACATIONING RESIDENTS, TAKE GRAFFITI REPORTS AND 
TICKET ILLEGALLY PARKED CARS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MACK REED, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hoping to put extra eyes and ears on the streets to deter crime in Thousand 
Oaks, the Ventura County Sheriff's Department is planning to assemble a 
volunteer senior citizens patrol. 
</P>
<P>
 Elderly volunteers are helping to make streets safer in such cities as 
Fountain Valley, Huntington Beach and even San Diego through similar programs, 
said Sheriff's Sgt. Bruce Hansen, who is drafting the proposal for Thousand 
Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're in the early planning stages of this program. We haven't even sent a 
report or any kind of request to the City Council or city manager yet," Hansen 
said Tuesday. "I'm sure there'll be a fairly decent level of interest in 
volunteers." 
</P>
<P>
 The volunteers would perform work that uniformed officers often don't get to 
because of a lack of time, such as checking on the homes of vacationing 
residents, taking graffiti reports, and ticketing illegally parked cars in fire 
lanes and spaces reserved for drivers with disabilities, Hansen said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Thousand Oaks volunteers might also be put into specially marked 
cruisers with two-way radios so that they can serve as a sort of roving 
Neighborhood Watch, Hansen said. 
</P>
<P>
 Volunteers would get a minimum of 30 to 40 hours of training, including in 
first aid, cardiopulmonary resuscitation and ticket-writing, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the things we'd hammer the hardest is that they're not police 
officers," Hansen warned. "They're citizen-volunteers and are not to become 
involved in law enforcement activities. If they observe a crime in progress, 
they're to take no action, but to maintain a safe distance, observe and report 
what they see to sworn deputies." 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1990, when a similar program began in Fountain Valley, elderly 
volunteers have freed sworn officers from hours spent on less-critical tasks, 
said Leslie Potter, who oversees the program. 
</P>
<P>
 But the city has also benefited from the volunteers, who roam the streets in 
two radio-equipped cars labeled with the Fountain Valley Police Department 
logo, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "When they're out in the city, they're very visible," Potter said. "People 
know who they are. It's a real deterrent. . . . They're basically the eyes and 
ears of the Police Department." 
</P>
<P>
 Hansen said that if approved, the Thousand Oaks program would start small, 
asking initially for about 20 volunteers between the ages of 55 and 80. 
</P>
<P>
 "With a smaller group, we'll be able to make any adjustments necessary before 
we try and broaden it," he said. "We'll find out how much we can get 
accomplished with those people and find out how much time is required (for 
deputies) to oversee a program like this." 
</P>
<P>
 But even before it has been announced officially, the program is drawing 
interest from older Thousand Oaks residents, said Frank James, a graduate of 
the Sheriff's Citizens Academy who has been working with Hansen on bringing the 
idea to life. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone I've spoken to about it has seemed very enthused. We'll probably 
have more volunteers than we can accept," said James, 66, a retired movie 
soundman. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's something people can get involved in and . . . help out in the community 
and still relieve some of the police officers from doing some of the mundane 
things they do -- if (officers) have time to do it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Added James: "And it's something to get involved in rather than sitting here 
watching the idiot box or something of that sort."

 Hot sunshine and sluggish onshore breezes pushed smog levels in Simi Valley 
over Memorial Day weekend to unhealthful levels for the first time this year in 
Ventura County, air quality officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The pollution standard index for ozone, a major component of smog, reached 100 
Saturday, touching the unhealthful level, according to readings taken in Simi 
Valley by the county Air Pollution Control District. On Sunday, the level 
pushed up to 114. 
</P>
<P>
 Anything more than 100 is considered unhealthful according to the pollution 
standard index of the federal Environmental Protection Agency, but California's 
stricter pollution standards consider air unhealthful if the smog is just 
three-quarters that thick. 
</P>
<P>
 Ozone levels dropped considerably Tuesday, but district forecasters predict 
that it will push upward today in Simi Valley toward levels that would violate 
state air quality standards. 
</P>
<P>
 And district data shows that Thousand Oaks violated state pollution standards 
Saturday and Sunday. And in Ojai, which suffered the next most severe pollution 
levels, the air was unhealthful by state standards Saturday and had improved 
only slightly Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is typical," said William Mount, deputy air pollution control officer in 
Ventura County. "Our smog season runs May through October, and the meteorology 
is conducive to fairly high levels of ambient ozone in those months. Over the 
weekend, we got strong sunlight and fairly stagnant conditions." 
</P>
<P>
 Smog hit unhealthful levels for the first time in 1993 on May 9, Mount said. 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley, Ojai and other inland areas often suffer some of the worst 
pollution in the county because they are in "convergence zones." Their canyons 
trap smog blown in from the Oxnard Plain by sea breezes, and from the San 
Fernando Valley when winds are blowing out to sea, Mount said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Winds have been onshore for the last few days, and what happens is all the 
emissions from Ventura and Oxnard move onshore into the canyons," he explained. 
</P>
<P>
 The high volume of holiday traffic could also have pushed the smog levels 
higher, Mount said. "Vehicles typically are emitting higher levels of 
pollutants when the traffic's congested," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County's May-to-October smog season parallels changes in the weather 
that worsen the concentration of pollutants from vehicles and industry -- which 
actually remain fairly constant throughout the year, Mount said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just so meteorologically specific," he said. "That's what people don't 
seem to realize. The same amount of stuff is going through the air every day. 
Everybody's driving their car the same way. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people want to believe that our ozone problem is due to the L. A. 
region, but typically our worst days for ozone are when the wind is blowing 
from the west." 
</P>
<P>
 Air pollution in Ventura County has decreased dramatically in recent years. In 
1974, its air pollution levels violated the federal health standard for ozone 
on 122 days, but that dropped to 45 days in 1984 and only 13 days in 1993, 
according to district statistics. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the federal Clean Air Act, the county has until 2005 to reduce the 
number of unhealthful days to no more than three in a three-year period.

ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE; A CHEER FOR GENDER EQUALITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The state appeals court in Santa Ana deserves three cheers for ruling that 
schools must set the bar at the same level for both cheerleaders and athletes. 
</P>
<P>
 The 4th District Court of Appeal decided last week in favor of Melissa Fontes, 
now a 20-year-old college student in Oregon. When Fontes was a student at 
Woodbridge High School in Irvine, she was thrown off the cheerleading team for 
getting an F in a chemistry course. 
</P>
<P>
 Her overall average was higher than the 2.5 minimum, but Irvine Unified School 
District rules required that cheerleaders and participants in other 
non-academic extracurricular activities have no failing grades. Athletes were 
held to lesser standards, being required merely to keep a 2.0 average and pass 
at least four courses in the previous quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Fontes sued the district, arguing for equal treatment. A Superior Court judge 
ruled against her, but the appeals court correctly took her side. 
</P>
<P>
 The district claimed that cheerleaders were role models in a way that 
defensive tackles or first basemen were not and so should be held to a higher 
standard. That is a dubious argument, because athletes obviously represent 
their school just as much as cheerleaders. 
</P>
<P>
 The different standards also had the effect of discriminating by gender, since 
cheerleaders are usually female and athletes historically have been male. 
</P>
<P>
 Presiding Justice David Sills sent the district the proper message in pointing 
out that it need not lower standards for cheerleaders. Instead, it could raise 
them for athletes. Why not require a 2.5 average and no failing grades to play 
basketball or soccer? That would treat all students the same, and might also 
improve academic performance by strengthening motivation for doing better in 
class. 
</P>
<P>
 The justices also were right to uphold the basic power of school districts to 
set minimum requirements in the classroom for those wanting to participate in 
school activities outside of class. 
</P>
<P>
 The first job of the schools is to educate, not to field football teams or 
squads to cheer the players on. As Justice Sheila Prell Sonenshine aptly put 
it, "The tail should not wag the dog."

YIELDS RISE WITH COMMODITIES SURGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Treasury bond yields rose Tuesday, influenced by another selloff in European 
bond markets and by inflation fears renewed by soaring commodity prices. 
</P>
<P>
 The stock market, however, showed little reaction in light post-holiday 
trading. The Dow industrials added 1.23 points to 3,758.37. 
</P>
<P>
 In the bond market, yields were marginally higher across the board. The 
Treasury's 30-year bond yield closed at 7.43%, up from Friday's 7.39%. 
</P>
<P>
 Bond traders were skittish in the wake of a rebound in the Commodity Research 
Bureau's index of 21 key commodities. The CRB, which had tumbled late last week 
as Midwest rains depressed grain prices, shot up Tuesday as forecasters 
predicted a new round of hot weather for the largely dry grain belt. 
</P>
<P>
 The CRB jumped 4.57 points, or 2%, to 235.45. It had peaked a week ago Monday 
at a 3 1/2-year high, before profit takers moved in. 
</P>
<P>
 Soybean, corn and wheat prices surged Tuesday. Also, traders piled back into 
coffee, cocoa, lumber and precious metals futures, reigniting the bull trends 
in those commodities. Near-term gold futures gained $2.40 to $387.10 an ounce 
on the Comex. Silver rose 7.6 cents to $5.53. 
</P>
<P>
 "The world economy is a lot hotter than people think," said Leo Doyle, 
economist with British merchant bank Kleinwort Benson. "The underlying strength 
in commodity prices is a sign of inflationary danger." 
</P>
<P>
 Many economists disagree, however. In fact, the federal government on Tuesday 
reported a drop in April home sales, suggesting that higher U.S. interest rates 
are working to slow the economy. 
</P>
<P>
 But that report failed to help bonds much. Traders said an overnight surge in 
European bond yields -- adding to last week's jump in yields there -- unnerved 
U.S. investors. 
</P>
<P>
 For the second time in a week, the German government scrubbed a scheduled bond 
auction, underscoring slack demand in the German bond market. The German 
central bank last week had indicated it might be finished cutting short-term 
interest rates, news that riled the bond market by suggesting that Europe's 
economic rebound may be at hand. 
</P>
<P>
 In European stock markets, Paris' CAC index tumbled 22.61 points to 2,029.90. 
But Frankfurt's DAX index shook off bonds' woes, rising 9.55 points to 
2,127.70. In London, the FTSE-100 index added 4.1 points to 2,970.5. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere overseas, Tokyo's Nikkei index continued its rally, rising 134.62 
points to 20,973.59. In Mexico City, the Bolsa index eased 1.68 points to 
2,483.73. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wall Street, stocks drifted to a mostly negative finish. 
</P>
<P>
 In the broad market, losers outnumbered gainers by about 3 to 2 on the Big 
Board, where the volume was a slow 215.8 million shares. 
</P>
<P>
 Smaller stocks had a similarly unexciting session, though the Nasdaq composite 
index gained 2.05 points to 735.19. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Tuesday's highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * The Dow industrials gained some support from Chevron, which climbed 1/2 to 
87 after Merrill Lynch & Co. raised the investment rating on the stock. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, Dow stock American Express surged 1 5/8 to 27 5/8 after completing the 
spinoff of its Lehman Bros. brokerage unit, which closed at 18 on its first 
official day of trading. 
</P>
<P>
 * One of the day's more conspicuous losers was Intermagnetics General, which 
tumbled 4 1/2 to 18 7/8 in heavy trading. An article in this week's Barrons 
said the company's fourth-quarter results will show improvement over the 
year-earlier levels but that sales have been sinking since 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 * Blockbuster Entertainment ended up 1 1/4 to 28 1/8. It was upgraded to "buy" 
from "market performer" by Robertson Stephens.  
</P>
<P>
 * McDonald's rose 1 to 62. Friday the company announced a 2-for-1 stock split 
and raised its dividend by 12%. 
</P>
<P>
 * Retailer Bombay rallied 1 1/4 to 15 7/8 after it posted a 23% rise in May 
sales at stores that have been open at least a year. 
</P>
<P>
 In the currency market, the dollar rose against the yen and most major 
currencies. At the close, the dollar was quoted at 104.85 Japanese yen, up from 
104.28 yen Friday. It rose to 1.647 German marks from 1.643 marks Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar was surprisingly unaffected by the negative economic news. Lately 
the dollar has been moving in tandem with bonds, but Tuesday was an exception. 
</P>
<P>
 "The dollar didn't come off," said Dorit Ronnen, foreign exchange trader at 
the New York office of Bank Leumi Trust Co. "It was a pretty dull market." 
</P>
<P>
 Ronnen said the dollar was lower against the mark in early trading, as traders 
tested whether central bankers would intervene in support of the currency.

O.C. ART REVIEW / CATHY CURTIS; A CLEAR PICTURE OF ANCIENT NUBIAN CULTURE 
PROVES ELUSIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CATHY CURTIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 OK, so it isn't thrilling. "Ancient Nubia: Egypt's Rival in Africa," at the 
Bowers Museum through Aug. 14, is a major scholarly show about a little-known 
ancient culture. Organized by the University Museum at the University of 
Pennsylvania, it's the kind of exhibition the Bowers needs if it is to be taken 
seriously as an educational institution. 
</P>
<P>
 Frankly, though, it isn't easy to bond with the ancient Nubians, even after an 
hour or so of gazing at the 234 objects in the galleries. Somehow, a clear 
image of these people -- who lived along the Nile River (in portions of 
modern-day Sudan and Egypt) between 3000 BC and AD 300 -- remains elusive. 
</P>
<P>
 This difficulty isn't entirely the fault of curator David O'Connor. Compared 
to what is known about ancient Egypt, Nubia is largely a riddle. Although 
excavations began in 1906, archeologists have unearthed only a small number of 
sites. 
</P>
<P>
 The stumbling blocks have been legion: flooding caused by the building of 
Egypt's Aswan Dam; intransigent Islamic fundamentalist leadership in the Sudan; 
civil war; and the logistic nightmares associated with working in the hottest, 
driest place in the world. Even Nubian texts have been only partially 
deciphered. 
</P>
<P>
 It is also very difficult to reconcile the tentativeness of scholarly research 
-- kernels of hard-won facts embedded in speculative theories -- and the need 
to paint a clear and vivid picture in an exhibition for the general public. 
</P>
<P>
 This task isn't made easier by the objects in the show. 
</P>
<P>
 The vessels, vessel shards, funerary sculptures, jewelry and other items 
simply aren't the sort of chichi objects, adorable miniatures or strikingly 
"modern-looking" sculptures that become conversation pieces. (Yet the Nubians 
did have a taste for luxe. "The Gold of Meroe," an exhibition at the 
Metropolitan Museum of Art last spring, showcased gold and silver jewelry from 
a Nubian queen's tomb.) 
</P>
<P>
 The visual treats on view at the Bowers tend to be sparser and more 
unexpected. Except for an attractively stylized gold and ivory image of a fly 
from the grave of a warrior who died about 1650-1550 BC -- as tenacious 
creatures, flies were emblems of military valor -- most of these pieces date 
from very late in the game (the Meroitic period, 250 BC-AD 350). 
</P>
<P>
 They include exuberantly free-form insects, animals and faces painted on 
vessels; a piquant funerary statue of a robed governor equipped with wings and 
a sun-disc balanced on the edge on his head; and a bronze pitcher whose handle 
metamorphoses into the seductive image of a woman bending forward, with 
outstretched arms. 
</P>
<P>
 One unsettling aspect of the show, however -- particularly in an era of 
far-ranging Afrocentric studies -- is the show's apparent indifference to 
racial matters. 
</P>
<P>
 Why aren't the Nubians viewed specifically as black Africans, with ties to 
other African cultures as well as to Egypt? Other sources point out that, in 
ancient Egyptian art, the Nubians are distinguished from the Egyptians by skin 
color, hair texture and facial features. 
</P>
<P>
 In the catalogue, O'Connor is oddly tight-lipped on this subject. The Nubians' 
"precise ethnic status is unknown," he writes. Case closed. Yet he 
unhesitatingly identifies men portrayed with kinky hair in an Egyptian tomb 
painting as Nubians bearing tribute to Pharaoh Tutankhamen. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Connor does insist on viewing ancient Nubia as a sophisticated rival of 
Egypt. Nubia had its own distinctive culture, he writes, a blend of Egyptian 
and Nubian elements. But he is maddeningly elusive about what those elements 
were, aside from fighting skills (thanks to years of service in Egyptian 
armies), a handful of as-yet poorly understood local gods, and certain burial 
practices. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 During the Bronze Age, people in Lower Nubia raised cattle and cultivated 
grains (for bread and beer), dates and nuts. Known awkwardly as the "A-Group" 
-- the provisional name bestowed by pioneering scholar George A. Reisner -- 
these early farmers lived in huts made of perishable materials, or mud-brick or 
masonry houses. 
</P>
<P>
 Graves containing elite members of society (and their servants and relatives) 
often contain imported goods -- such as copper objects and jars from Egypt -- 
indicating the importance of trade to upper-class living standards. As in 
Egypt, objects buried with the dead were meant to be used in the afterlife. 
</P>
<P>
 The A-Group was supplanted by the C-Group around 2400 BC. A few hundred years 
later, when Egypt was in a decline, the Kingdom of Kush became a wealthy and 
powerful state further south along the Nile, in Upper Nubia. (This culture is 
confusingly labeled as "Kerma" because the excavation site is in the modern 
Sudanese town of Kerma.) 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Kerma culture kings were buried under mounds of earth (tumuli) nearly as big 
as football fields. Dead royalty, surrounded by hundreds of harem-women, 
servants and guards obliged to die for their master, were placed on huge beds. 
(The show includes the surviving wooden legs of one such bed, carved in the 
shape of animal legs.) 
</P>
<P>
 In the catalogue, O'Connor raises the specter of ethnocentric bias, which 
leads us "to overvalue developed societies with material cultures similar in 
important ways to our own, and undervalue others with material cultures more 
alien to us." 
</P>
<P>
 Just because the great Egyptian pyramids were much bigger than the royal 
Nubian tumuli (10,000 square meters versus 6,400 square meters), that doesn't 
mean Egyptian culture was necessarily superior. 
</P>
<P>
 Other elite members of society -- upper-level bureaucrats, priests, military 
leaders -- also were buried with such accouterments as toiletry kits (razors, 
containers for eyeliner), swords and ostrich fans, as well as pottery 
containers and tableware. 
</P>
<P>
 Interestingly, the bowls and jars found in cemeteries tend to be small (as 
opposed to the various useful sizes found in settlements) and there are hardly 
any cooking pots -- as if the dead and their retainers would be relieved of 
kitchen chores in the afterlife. 
</P>
<P>
 Egypt conquered Nubia around 1550 BC, but it seems to have permitted its 
colonial outpost a lot of freedom, primarily for reasons of self-interest: 
Egypt depended on Nubia as a trading center for gold, ebony, ivory and animal 
skins from other African states. Although dark-skinned slaves are portrayed in 
Egyptian paintings of the era, O'Connor writes that these people "probably" 
were not really Nubians but just folks from Southern Nubia (a sort of 
unincorporated area populated by nomads). 
</P>
<P>
 In 724 BC, the pendulum swung again. Kushite King Piye conquered Egypt and 
declared himself Pharaoh. The Assyrians invaded 60 years later, driving the 
Nubians back to their homeland. 
</P>
<P>
 Undaunted, the Nubians established a court in Meroe, which became a 
cosmopolitan center reflecting the cultures of central Africa, Egypt, and 
Greece and Rome. In Meroe, the Nubians developed a written alphabet, allowing 
them to place inscribed tablets in temples and tombs. (Some of these are in the 
show.) 
</P>
<P>
 In the exhibition, a wooden and ivory box from a woman's grave handily sums up 
the extent of this ancient form of multiculturalism. The partially draped 
female figures look like provincial Roman work, as do the garland decorations. 
The sphinxes are Egyptian, of course, and lion faces might represent Apedemak, 
a Nubian lion god particular to the Meroitic period. 
</P>
<P>
 The Nubian world underwent a major cultural upheaval in the Sixth Century, 
when missionaries converted the Nubians to Christianity. Islam was introduced 
in the 1300s. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, certain Nubian traits persist among the people of the Sudan, southern 
Egypt and Ethiopia. The lively catalogue on Nubia issued by the Museum of Fine 
Arts, Boston -- which also has conducted extensive digs in Nubia -- mentions 
and illustrates such things as women's hairstyles, tattooing and scarification, 
a love of wrestling, funerary beds (no longer buried with the dead, but used in 
processions) and similar styles of pottery and sandals. 
</P>
<P>
 Details like these can make a remote period snap into focus. For all its 
worthy scholarship, the University of Pennsylvania's museum might have put much 
more effort into building bridges between the vitality of an ancient culture 
and the curiosity of today's viewer. 
</P>

monthlong hot streak of game-winning hits that brought the crowd to its feet . 
. . or, be a rock star on tour for a month and receive nightly adulation from 
screaming fans? 
</P>
<P>
 Notwithstanding we were in our early 30s when we concocted the scenarios, such 
is the stuff of teen-ager daydreams. 
</P>
<P>
 My answer invariably was, I'd be the ballplayer . . . I mean, the rock star . 
. . I mean, the ballplayer . . . I mean, the rock star. 
</P>
<P>
 After attending opening night of the Eagles reunion tour last Friday, the 
answer is so much clearer. Am I too old for fantasies? 
</P>
<P>
 For the sheer power to move people, can anything touch music? And for many of 
us who have come of age in the last 35 years, can anything touch rock music? 
</P>
<P>
 "After 15 years, here we are again!" a man called out to a friend Friday 
night, 15 minutes before show time, as they settled in the $115-a-seat section. 
"Boy, this is going to be a good night!" 
</P>
<P>
 It would be easier for my little essay today if I could describe some palpable 
buzz in the crowd or some crystallizing moment that captured the preconcert 
spirit. Truth is, things were pretty ordinary. You'd have thought the Boston 
Pops was about to perform. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anybody bring any chicken?" a man said to his friends as they nestled in on 
blankets on the lawn seating. Just a few feet away, a concession stand offered 
Evian water for $2.50. 
</P>
<P>
 Hardly an obvious scenario for anything momentous. Woodstock it wasn't. 
</P>
<P>
 And yet, the night became a special one for thousands of people. 
</P>
<P>
 When it was over, I was once again awed by the power that singers and 
songwriters wield. Even if the 15,000 brought their personalized memories of 
the music, there was still a common bond. I didn't need to know why the couple 
behind me in their 40s was hugging as Don Henley sang about the "wasted time" 
that we all fear we may have spent. I didn't need to wonder why everyone was so 
amused by Joe Walsh as he almost literally belted out his lyrics to "Life's 
Been Good" or why all 15,000 of us had fun singing the chorus line "He's Cool!" 
as it flashed on the video screens next to the stage. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe in a society where we have to be wary of the guy standing next to you, 
it's comforting to suspend that because of shared musical experience. At 
Friday's concert, we were 15,000 strangers with no secrets among us. 
</P>
<P>
 This week, I asked Jon Wiener, a music professor at UC Irvine and author of a 
book on John Lennon, why the appeal lies beyond the sound of the music. 
</P>
<P>
 "Music for some reason, and especially pop music, which is ephemeral, is tied 
to a specific moment, and it can trigger very intense memories, even flashbacks 
of a moment when this song was new and popular and you listened to it a lot," 
he said. "We don't have that kind of experience with lots of other parts of the 
culture, partly because pop music is tied to a particular moment. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's also something about the collective experience of being in a big 
crowd that's kind of a celebration, that's very different than listening by 
yourself to your own records." The result, Wiener said, is "that you can get an 
amplification of your feelings with all the other people who are there." 
</P>
<P>
 One of the interested spectators Friday night was Jack Tempchin, who wrote the 
Eagles' "Peaceful Easy Feeling" and co-wrote "Already Gone." 
</P>
<P>
 While he was getting ready to perform last night at the Marine Room Tavern in 
Laguna Beach, I asked Tempchin about the Eagles' music. 
</P>
<P>
 "The thing is, that it's real," he said. "They were never a band that ran 
across the stage a lot or jumped on the amps. It's real, and there's a lot of 
content. If you listen to the songs, that's what struck me. They're really 
moving, there's a lot of thought behind them and a lot of content in the songs, 
which you don't get from most music." 
</P>
<P>
 I asked what it felt like to hear his songs sung in front of 15,000 people, 
most of whom know the words and can put a memory to it. "When they did 'Already 
Gone,' I was completely happy right there," Tempchin said. 
</P>
<P>
 When I told him I was miffed the Eagles didn't play "Peaceful Easy Feeling," 
Tempchin good-naturedly pointed out they didn't play it the last time he saw 
them perform 14 years ago, either. 
</P>
<P>
 I was shamelessly gushy in talking to Tempchin, largely because I think 
"Peaceful Easy Feeling" is a work of art. "A song starts out being a personal 
thing and if gets out there (as a hit with the public), it's a miracle," he 
said. "After it leaves you, then the song is beyond your control and you look 
at it and say, 'Gee, they're playing it in Istanbul.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Wow, from Istanbul to Irvine -- all because of a three-minute record. 
</P>
<P>
 It may be a fool's errand to explain why the Eagles reuniting is any kind of a 
big deal. I suppose if you asked the 15,000, you'd get 15,000 different 
answers. 
</P>
<P>
 But if nothing else, you'd come away with some sense of this 20th-Century 
phenomenon called rock music. 
</P>
<P>
 How could I ever have thought being a ballplayer could hold a candle to this? 
</P>

STREET VENDOR ARRESTS UP DESPITE LEGALIZATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK J. McDONNELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After years of struggle, thousands of street vendors were jubilant in January 
when the City Council legalized sidewalk vending in designated districts 
throughout Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 But almost five months after passage of a law viewed as a seminal victory for 
Los Angeles' Latino immigrant population, city officials have not issued a 
single vendor's permit. And vendors are being arrested more frequently than 
before the law was passed. 
</P>
<P>
 The legalization process has become mired in implementation details, including 
the mandated creation of eight new business districts where vending will be 
allowed for a two-year test period. 
</P>
<P>
 With issuance of the first permits still months away, a delegation of three 
dozen of the city's estimated 5,000 street vendors gathered Tuesday outside 
Parker Center to protest what they characterize as a mean-spirited police 
crackdown violating the spirit of January's historic City Council action. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're just asking to be allowed to make a living, support our families and 
pay our bills," said Leobardo Cabral, president of the Street Vendors Assn., 
which represents more than 800 entrepreneurs, most of them immigrants from 
Mexico and Central America. "Why should they be arresting us?" 
</P>
<P>
 Police deny any harassment or crackdown, although authorities acknowledge that 
tickets issued to illegal vendors are up substantially compared with last year. 
Police issued 839 citations to vendors between Jan. 1 and May 23, compared to 
952 such actions during all of last year, said Commander Scott LaChasse, who 
coordinates the police street vendor program. Violators could face up to six 
months in jail and $1,000 fines for the misdemeanor violations, although most 
fines are $20 to $250. 
</P>
<P>
 According to LaChasse, the increasing number of sidewalk merchants and 
heightened public awareness of the problem have led to more complaints from 
store owners, who often resent the competition and clutter associated with 
street hawkers. Officers seldom target the vendors without complaints, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The public is more acutely aware, and we respond to public complaints, and 
that has resulted in an increase in enforcement," LaChasse said. 
</P>
<P>
 Such arguments, however, do not mollify street vendors, who say they are 
convinced that the police have targeted them in an effort to short-circuit the 
new law. 
</P>
<P>
 "The police don't want us to get our permits," said Virgilia Yescas, a 
40-year-old mother of five from Mexico who sells homemade tamales and the hot 
chocolate drink known as champurrado near the corner of Normandie Avenue and 
Pico Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 The police crackdown, vendors say, has sliced many vendors' hours, reducing 
weekly earnings from $300 to $100 or less. Some express fears that they will be 
unable to afford the needed permits, insurance and business licenses once the 
legal vending program is in effect.

CRUSADING IN QUAKE COUNTRY; EVANGELIST LUIS PALAU WILL PREACH 5 EVENINGS IN VAN 
NUYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN DART, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Who is this Luis Palau whose name shows up on posters, lawn signs and bumper 
stickers across Los Angeles and is the buzz of the evangelical churches? 
</P>
<P>
 He is an Argentine-born evangelist who is believed to have preached en masse 
to more people -- 10 million souls in 60 countries -- than anyone but Billy 
Graham. Despite that, he is a little-known figure outside the world of 
evangelical churches and traveling crusades. 
</P>
<P>
 That could change beginning today when the 59-year-old Palau brings his 
crusade to earthquake country, in the secular surroundings of the Birmingham 
High School football stadium in Van Nuys, for a series of nighttime events to 
include entertainers Pat Boone, Smokey Robinson and Dean Jones. 
</P>
<P>
 The emotional and spiritual shivers sent up by the Jan. 17 Northridge 
earthquake and its aftershocks are a big reason why organizers expect to draw 
heavily from the San Fernando Valley, where nearly 200 churches have helped 
organize the events. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "The timing of the crusade is providential," said the Rev. Scott Hilborn, 
pastor of Canoga Park Presbyterian Church. Hilborn said he does not believe God 
wrought the 6.8-magnitude quake as any judgment on the local scene. But, he 
said, "It seems very clear to me that God has used this earthquake in very 
positive ways for the spiritual well-being of Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
 "The quake heightens everybody's awareness of a need for an anchor that goes 
deeper than job and family," said the Rev. Scott Bauer, a crusade official who 
is senior associate pastor at Church on the Way in Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
 Palau said Tuesday that he and his aides a year ago were describing the 
planned San Fernando Valley crusade as the "Hollywood-Burbank Crusade" because 
few people knew where the Valley was. "When the earthquake hit there was no 
need to say Hollywood-Burbank anymore," he quipped during a news conference at 
the crusade site. 
</P>
<P>
 Palau was invited by 50 pastors, mostly in the Valley, with the 8,000-member 
Church on the Way taking the lead in organization. The church provided office 
space for a year and the crusade's honorary co-chairmen, Pat Boone and car 
dealer and philanthropist Bert Boeckmann, are church members. 
</P>
<P>
 Local organizers and staff officials from the Luis Palau Evangelistic Assn., 
based in Portland, Ore., say interest has been unusually high. About 2,800 
people have turned out for classes to learn how to assist and encourage crusade 
participants to commit themselves as Christians. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've trained twice as many people as counselors than we have for any other 
crusade," said crusade director Colin James, of Portland. 
</P>
<P>
 Palau, who patterns his programs after Graham's popular crusades, has earned 
the confidence of church leaders because he has steered clear of sexual 
scandal, politics of the religious right and unconventional teachings. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the participating pastors and churches fall into the 
charismatic/Pentecostal and evangelical range of the Christian spectrum. 
Nonetheless, the crusade's backers include three United Methodist 
congregations, three Episcopal parishes and two Lutheran churches that are 
affiliated with liberal-to-moderate denominations. 
</P>
<P>
 More than one pastor noted that among the many socially and religiously 
conservative churches taking part, there are conflicting views on women's 
ordination, baptism and other issues. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have churches that have put aside differences for the sake of unity," 
James said. 
</P>
<P>
 Queenie Walcott, a member of Lake View Terrace Baptist Church, is typical of 
the kind of person the crusade's organizers want to attend the rallies. "I need 
more spiritual growth to learn about relying on Scripture to deal with 
different situations," Walcott said. 
</P>
<P>
 She also plans to bring a couple of friends with her -- people who she said 
have intermittently gone to church or Bible studies but have yet to make strong 
commitments. Those are also the kind of people organizers hope will attend. 
</P>
<P>
 One conspicuous non-supporter is Pastor John MacArthur's Grace Community 
Church in Sun Valley, which averages a total of 8,000 people at its three 
Sunday services. 
</P>
<P>
 MacArthur is a fundamentalist in doctrine who has been critical of 
charismatic/Pentecostal churches because of their supernatural claims of 
healing and speaking in tongues, but the Rev. Lance Quinn, senior associate 
pastor, said that Grace Community elders decided not to become involved in the 
crusade because of their own effective ministry. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have 100 to 150 visitors each Sunday who have never been to our church 
before," Quinn said. "We are not discouraging anyone from participating as 
individuals," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision by church elders forced the Rev. Daniel Lozano, pastor of a 
400-member Spanish-speaking congregation meeting at Grace Community, to 
withdraw from the Latino committee for the Palau crusade. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew Luis Palau back in Argentina some 30 years ago," said Lozano, pastor 
of Grace Community's Spanish Department. "We preached in each other's churches 
in Cordoba." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Lozano and some other Latino Protestant leaders in the Valley have been 
disappointed that the crusade did not include bigger plans for Palau to preach 
in Spanish. All five evenings of the crusade are in English with simultaneous 
translation in Spanish for those who bring radios and earphones. 
</P>
<P>
 The one Spanish service linked to the crusade was held Saturday night at 
Church on the Way and attracted 2,500 people. Organizers said they limited the 
Spanish outreach because they worried that holding rallies in Spanish and 
English on consecutive nights would be confusing to people. 
</P>
<P>
 The unusual venue came about because the Valley has no professional sports 
arena or major stadium. So the Palau organization had to be content with the 
bleachers and temporary field-level seating at Birmingham High School's 
football field, which can accommodate 15,000 people.

READING, WRITING AND RETICENCE; ANGRY TEACHERS MUM FOR A DAY TO PROTEST PAY 
LEVEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENISE HAMILTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fractions are not the most scintillating topic when you're in eighth grade, 
but Margaret E. Wallace found her math students focusing like a laser beam when 
she strode to the head of the class Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 They were all ears, but Wallace stayed mum throughout the class, wearing a 
Mona Lisa smile as she tapped the day's lesson into a computer linked to an 
overhead projector at Orange Grove Middle School in Hacienda Heights. 
</P>
<P>
 Wallace, who is also president of the Hacienda La Puente Teachers Assn., was 
one of hundreds of educators in the 22,000-student San Gabriel Valley school 
district who observed a day of silence Tuesday because they are angry over the 
district's unwillingness to meet their demand for a 6% pay increase. 
</P>
<P>
 The teachers union estimated that 85% to 90% of the district's 1,200 teachers 
did not talk. The district's superintendent said he would not have figures 
until today. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Some teachers said students paid more attention Tuesday than usual, intrigued 
by how educators intended to teach without talking. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was pretty cool," concluded Alicia Bartko, 13, of Orange Grove Middle 
School. "We paid attention more because we didn't know what to expect, we 
didn't know what the teachers would do." 
</P>
<P>
 And that varied from classroom to classroom. 
</P>
<P>
 Special education teacher Holly Elmer carried around a note pad on which she 
scribbled messages to thrust under students' noses. Example: "Why aren't you 
working?" 
</P>
<P>
 Music teacher Edward Chavez used sign language to lead the school band through 
"Everything's Coming Up Roses." Students were unusually well-behaved and spoke 
in whispers to each other and to him, Chavez said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe they thought they were supposed to have a day of silence too," he 
joked. 
</P>
<P>
 Other teachers used monosyllabic grunts, asked aides to relay instructions, 
showed films or allowed students to get a jump on homework. But not everyone 
thought the day of silence was a good idea. 
</P>
<P>
 Supt. Andy Cazares called it a violation of the teachers' contract, which 
prohibits any work stoppages or slowdowns. Cazares agreed that nonverbal 
communication was a novelty but said he worried that "learning to its fullest 
degree probably didn't take place." 
</P>
<P>
 The superintendent said the cash-strapped district has made almost $7 million 
in cuts in the last two years and finds it hard to meet teacher demands. One 
possibility under study is closing or consolidating schools. 
</P>
<P>
 At La Puente High School, Phuong Nguyen, 17, said several of her teachers 
opted to talk because they wanted to help students review for final exams. When 
asked by students if he planned to speak, Nguyen's trigonometry teacher seemed 
ambivalent at first. 
</P>
<P>
 "He hesitated, and then he wrote something on the board, and then he said, 
'I'm going to talk, but I'm going to talk less,' " Nguyen said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nguyen thought her teacher did the right thing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Finals are coming up, and if he doesn't talk, we'd be lost. We have to review 
all those formulas and it's very important to us," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Several La Puente High students said only half of their teachers observed the 
day of silence. But even some staff members who did not said they support their 
colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're making a stand and they have every right to do that; we've gone a 
long time without a raise," said one counselor at La Puente High who did not 
want to give her name and said she talked during the day. 
</P>
<P>
 Raymond R. Lopp, executive director of the teachers union, said teachers used 
the same tactic in 1988 to draw attention to their demands. They eventually got 
a raise. Rowland Heights teachers, who are also in Lopp's union, staged a day 
of silence in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Six years after that first action, Lopp says teachers in Hacienda La Puente 
still are near the bottom of the pay scale for the region. Starting teachers 
earn $23,056, ranking 43rd among the 44 districts in Los Angeles County. The 
union and the school district go back to the bargaining table today.  
</P>
<P>
 Last week, teachers prepared their students for the silent treatment and the 
union sent out memos urging teachers to take part. 
</P>
<P>
 "We said to them, 'You have to use your judgment; we're not interested in 
jeopardizing anyone,' " Lopp said. "If a kid has serious problems or trouble at 
home, obviously they're going to have to be talked to." 
</P>
<P>
 The teacher action had some parental support. Julie Economides, who was 
picking up her daughter, Jessica, 11, at Orange Grove, said teachers should 
fight for their rights. 
</P>
<P>
 "They deserve to have their pay raise," Economides said, "because if they 
don't get it they'll strike, and then our kids won't get taught."

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LONG BEACH; OFFICER TO 
STAND TRIAL IN RAPE OF PROSTITUTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Long Beach police officer must stand trial for allegedly forcing a professed 
prostitute to perform sexual acts under the threat of arrest, a judge ruled 
Tuesday.  
</P>
<P>
 Municipal Judge Elva Soper found that there was enough evidence to order Bryon 
Ellsberry to stand trial on single counts of oral copulation under color of 
authority and rape by threat to arrest.Soper dropped a third count of attempted 
oral copulation under color of authority.  
</P>
<P>
 Ellsberry was charged last month for acts that allegedly occurred while he was 
on duty. A self-described prostitute testified that she performed oral 
copulation on Ellsberry and had sexual intercourse with him -- without monetary 
compensation -- after he threatened to arrest her for unpaid warrants. She then 
set up a sting with Internal Affairs officers and, wearing an electronic 
device, agreed to perform a sexual act under threat of arrest. 
</P>
<P>
 The 29-year-old officer's attorney contends that his client was set up. 
Arraignment is scheduled in Superior Court for June 14.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: MID-WILSHIRE; TWO 
SOUGHT IN ASSAULTS ON 5 WOMEN IN BREAK-IN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Authorities are seeking two suspected rapists who brutally assaulted five 
women over the weekend in a Mid-Wilshire home, and then fled in two of the 
victims' cars. 
</P>
<P>
 The attack occurred about 10 p.m. Sunday in the 800 block of South Norton 
Avenue, said Los Angeles police Officer Rigo Romero.Televised news broadcasts 
initially reported that the suspects had followed two of the women home from a 
shopping mall, but detectives said Tuesday there is no evidence that that was 
the case. 
</P>
<P>
 The two men, armed with handguns, apparently broke into the house and found 
four of the five victims inside, detectives said. The men allegedly raped and 
beat the four women, and then attacked the fifth when she came home 
unexpectedly. 
</P>
<P>
 The attackers fled in two of the women's cars, one of which was recovered 
Tuesday in Los Angeles, Romero said. The women were treated and released from a 
hospital, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said one suspect is in his late teens; the other is in his early 20s. 
The younger man was last seen wearing a black jacket with red and yellow 
stripes and black pants; the other man wore black pants and a black Los Angeles 
Raiders jacket, Romero said.  
</P>
<P>
 The stolen cars that has yet to be recovered is a brown, two-door 1972 Cutlass 
Supreme, license 1JUE662.

 The Medical Board of California licenses physicians and other medical 
professionals. It also investigates complaints about medical treatment and 
issues disciplinary actions. The most serious penalties include license 
revocation, suspension and probation. These are the Los Angeles County medical 
professionals subject to serious disciplinary actions between Aug. 1 and Oct. 
31, 1993, according to medical board documents. Final actions are published 
only after all appeals are exhausted.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; CITY 
COUNCIL OKS 50% CUT IN TRASH SURCHARGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles City Council has approved a 50% cut in the surcharge residents 
pay for automated refuse collection containers.  
</P>
<P>
 Effective July 1, homeowners will pay an extra $1.50 on top of the regular $3 
monthly sanitation equipment charge.For apartment dwellers, the total monthly 
fee will fall to $3, with the surcharge reduced to $1.  
</P>
<P>
 The council levied the extra fee two years ago to balance the budget. The 
surcharge is scheduled to expire June 30, 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 The reduction reflected the council's desire to give businesses and residents 
a break on taxes. The council also approved a cut in the 7.5% business tax 
surcharge.  
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Richard Riordan proposed eliminating the entire business tax surcharge 
as a gesture to soften the city's anti-business image. But the council wanted 
residents to get relief too, and halved the sanitation equipment surcharge as a 
compromise.

RETURN OF THE CASTAWAY; OWNERS PLAN TO REBUILD LANDMARK RESTAURANT DESTROYED BY 
FIRE IN BURBANK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Comedian Bob Hope could sometimes be found sitting at the bar. 
</P>
<P>
 Other locals loved it for its sweeping vista of the northeast San Fernando 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 The Castaway restaurant, a 31-year-old landmark perched in the Verdugo Hills 
in Burbank, also drew Burbank-based companies such as the Walt Disney Co., NBC 
and Lockheed for get-togethers in banquet rooms next-door. 
</P>
<P>
 "People would come and sip a pina colada, listen to a song and warm their 
hands on a furnace," said Rod Westmaas, director of catering for Castaway's 
banquet center. "More than a restaurant, it was an institution. When the fire 
went up, many said many dreams and memories went up in smoke." 
</P>
<P>
 Today, meeting rooms and a fenced-off pile of debris surrounded by palm trees 
are all that remain of the restaurant, which was destroyed last summer by an 
arsonist still at large. 
</P>
<P>
 But the restaurant's operators hope to begin rebuilding in July with about 
$2.2 million in insurance proceeds and reopen in December. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, two large banquet rooms next to the restaurant are still 
functional, serving as the site for weddings, company parties and high school 
proms. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not up to our former strength yet, but we've come back strong," 
Westmaas said. 
</P>
<P>
 When it is resurrected, the hilltop restaurant will look much as it did before 
from the inside -- an island retreat. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, however, there will be a sprinkler system, an indoor waterfall, a 
higher ceiling, larger bathrooms, an exterior made of rough cedar and a lobby 
three times the original size. 
</P>
<P>
 "To me, it needed a face lift badly. The toilets were an embarrassment as far 
as I was concerned," said Ron Weil, director of design for Specialty 
Restaurants Corp., an Anaheim-based company. 
</P>
<P>
 Complaints from residents who worried about increased traffic on the hilltop 
forced corporation President David Tallichet to consider a more limited 
expansion. The new proposal would expand the restaurant 1,100 square feet. 
</P>
<P>
 The plans were presented to the City Council on Tuesday but council members, 
still uncertain about what the environmental impact would be for residents, 
voted 4 to 0 to continue a public hearing to June 21. 
</P>
<P>
 The June 29 fire resulted in more than $1 million in damage. There have been 
no suspects caught, despite a $10,000 reward offered by Specialty Restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
 Some people living near the Castaway, such as Esther Christoffersen, have been 
grateful for the decreased noise and traffic ever since. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since the Castaway has gone in, the traffic has been horrendous," said 
Christoffersen, 74, who has lived on Harvard Road since 1949. "We can't sleep 
in our front bedroom because of the noise. It has just destroyed a quiet 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I had my druthers, I'd like to not see it rebuilt. We have enjoyed having 
the quietness of our street back again." 
</P>
<P>
 The fire forced most of the 200 people who worked at the restaurant and 
banquet center into the job market again. Some have coped well; others have 
not. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess I felt the pain of many employees who lost their job," Westmaas said. 
"One individual, a cocktail server, said her whole life was shot. Her whole 
psyche is out of whack. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd prefer not to believe it was an employee or a former employee (who 
started the fire). But you can never rule anything out."

ANIMAL REGULATION POLICY CHANGED TO ALLOW LIMITED COYOTE TRAPPING; WILDLIFE: 
L.A. HOMEOWNERS WILL HAVE TO TAKE SAFETY MEASURES AND PAY TO HAVE TRAPS SET. 
THE DECISION LEAVES RESIDENTS AND ANIMAL RIGHTS ADVOCATES STILL AT ODDS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Animal Regulation Commission decided Tuesday to allow city 
employees in limited circumstances to trap and kill coyotes in residential 
areas, modifying its ban on the practice but failing to satisfy homeowners and 
animal rights activists at odds over the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the new policy animal regulation officers will charge residents a $200 
fee to set traps, but only after property owners meet certain conditions, such 
as putting up fences to deter coyote intrusions. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision by the panel is a response to the often heated debate among 
wildlife advocates and others, who say trapping is inhumane and ineffective at 
controlling the coyote population, and homeowners, who maintain that trapping 
is needed to protect pets and children from attacks. 
</P>
<P>
 The new policy replaces a ban that residents said resulted in a dramatic 
increase in coyote sightings since it was adopted 10 months ago. Officials said 
it would have been too costly to reinstitute trapping on demand. 
</P>
<P>
 Several animal rights activists said the fee imposed under the new policy 
should be increased to more closely reflect the estimated $5,800 the city 
spends to set and maintain each trap, while others denounced the practice of 
trapping under any circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents of the ban complained that the criteria are so difficult to meet 
that the new policy, in essence, continues the ban. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are so many caveats that it leaves the ban in place," said Michael 
Lazarou, a Woodland Hills resident who says that a coyote stalked his toddler 
son in his back yard in December. 
</P>
<P>
 The policy, unanimously approved by the commission, was recommended by Gary 
Olsen, the Animal Regulation Department's general manager. The city will set 
traps for a resident only under the following circumstances: 
</P>
<P>
 * An animal regulation official must first visit the home of the resident who 
has complained about a coyote problem and provide educational material that 
explains the habits of the animal and ways to protect against coyote attacks. 
</P>
<P>
 * The official must then recommend mitigation measures, such as installing 
tall fences, that the resident can take to deter coyotes from entering the 
property. 
</P>
<P>
 * The resident must then sign an affidavit that the measures have been 
implemented and agree to waive the city's liability in case a pet or child is 
caught in the trap. The resident must also notify all residents within 300 
yards of the property that trapping will occur. 
</P>
<P>
 * Once all of the above criteria are met, the city will charge the resident 
$200 to set and maintain a trap on the property until a coyote is caught or 
until an animal regulation official determines that the problem no longer 
exists. 
</P>
<P>
 The city may also allow limited trapping when a coyote is suspected of having 
rabies because of an attack on a person; when a county, state or federal agency 
mandates it because of public safety concerns, or when a coyote is sick or 
injured. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission will review the policy after a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Olsen said he expects the policy to dramatically reduce the number of coyotes 
trapped annually. During the year before the ban, the department trapped and 
killed 35 coyotes, city officials said. (State law requires the city to kill a 
trapped coyote and forbids it from relocating the animal to another area.) 
</P>
<P>
 Before voting on the recommendation, commission President Mimi Robins said she 
realized that the new policy will not satisfy all sides on the highly 
contentious issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically this is an ugly issue and regardless of what the commission does, 
not everyone will be happy," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The trapping controversy began in June, 1993, when the commission voted -- 
partly in response to pressure from animal rights advocates -- to halt the 
trapping of coyotes by city employees. The panel left residents the option of 
hiring a certified pest control company to trap the animals. Such companies 
charge about $800 to trap coyotes. 
</P>
<P>
 But since the ban, hillside residents, mostly in the west San Fernando Valley, 
have complained about an increase in coyote sightings and attacks on pets. A 
city report said the city gets about 500 calls a year about coyote sightings. 
Figures showing the increase in calls were not immediately available.

KING JURORS ASK ABOUT POLICE POLICY; COURTS: PANEL WANTS TO KNOW IF ALLOWING 
USE OF BATONS TO BREAK BONES VIOLATES 4TH AMENDMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In their 10th day of deliberations, jurors in Rodney G. King's civil lawsuit 
passed a note to the judge that lawyers interpreted as indicating that jurors 
may be stuck over whether the force used by police officers was so excessive 
that it violated King's constitutional rights. 
</P>
<P>
 The jury asked U.S. District Judge John G. Davies if a police policy that 
sanctioned the use of batons to break bones could be considered a violation of 
the U.S. Constitution's 4th Amendment, which guarantees the right to be free 
from unreasonable searches and seizures. 
</P>
<P>
 After briefing attorneys on the question, Davies called the jury into the 
courtroom and gave his answer. "I think a legal answer to that question is 
'no,' " he said. "Policy is not a violation of the 4th Amendment." 
</P>
<P>
 After the court session, King's attorney, Milton Grimes, said the issue was 
not about policy. "The issue is that the force used was unreasonable and 
unnecessary." 
</P>
<P>
 Grimes and other attorneys speculated that the jury was stalled over how to 
interpret the beating on March 3, 1991. King's attorneys have argued that 
officers who beat and kicked King used excessive force and violated his 
constitutional rights. But attorneys for the officers -- two of whom were 
convicted of civil rights violations in a criminal trial -- said they were 
following orders. 
</P>
<P>
 Grimes said he believes the jury is also tiring. 
</P>
<P>
 "They appeared a lot more solemn and tense than I've seen them in the past," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney Michael Stone, who represents former Officer Laurence M. Powell, said 
the jury did not seem to be near a decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "It sounds like they're still debating the issue of a lawful use of force," he 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 The jury is trying to decide whether to assess punitive damages against six 
current and former officers involved in the beating. It earlier awarded King 
$3.8 million in damages from the city.

 Felony charges were formally filed Tuesday against Richard Allen Davis, 
accused of kidnaping and murdering 12-year-old Polly Klaas. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis did not enter a plea at the brief hearing and Sonoma County Superior 
Court Judge Arnold Rosenfield continued the matter until July 6.During the 
hearing, Davis waived his right to a speedy trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis is charged with 11 felony counts in connection with the abduction and 
murder. He faces the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 Polly was kidnaped during a slumber party at her Petaluma home Oct. 1. Her 
body was found Dec. 4 in a wooded area off U.S. 101 near Cloverdale. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis was arrested Nov. 30. Prosecutors said he confessed during a six-hour 
videotaped interview and led police to Polly's body. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Public Defender Barry Collins said Davis will enter a not guilty plea. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Greg Jacobs said he would fight any defense motions for a 
change of venue.

PRINCETON REACTOR SETS RECORD FOR FUSION-GENERATED ELECTRICITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A test reactor at Princeton University has reached a record of 9 million watts 
of electricity generation by nuclear fusion, officials announced Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The record by the doughnut-shaped Tokamak Fusion Test Reactor was nearly 50% 
higher than the previous record of 6.2 million watts attained by the same 
reactor in December. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're very pleased. The staff is ecstatic," said Ron Davidson, director of 
the Princeton Plasma Physics Lab, which operates the reactor under contract 
with the U.S. Department of Energy. 
</P>
<P>
 But fusion requires high temperatures and takes large amounts of external 
power to fuse the atoms. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest output record, reached Friday, produced only 40% as much power as 
was needed to create the fusion. 
</P>
<P>
 Fusion has long been envisioned as a method of producing a virtually limitless 
form of environmentally safe energy. Unlike nuclear fission, which requires 
nuclear fuel and leaves hazardous wastes, fusion is produced from water and 
produces no pollution. 
</P>
<P>
 The Princeton, N.J., reactor is scheduled to be decommissioned in September. 
The lab has proposed that a new reactor, known as TPX for Tokamak Physics 
Experiment, be developed starting next year. The $694-million reactor could be 
operational by 2000. 
</P>
<P>
 Similar experiments are being done at the European Torus reactor in 
Oxfordshire, England.

WILSON SUES OVER IMMIGRANT HEALTH CARE; COURTS: GOVERNOR CALLS ON FEDERAL 
GOVERNMENT TO COVER NEARLY $370 MILLION IN EMERGENCY MEDICAL COSTS OF ILLEGAL 
RESIDENTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson sued the federal government Tuesday, seeking nearly $370 
million for the cost of providing emergency medical care for illegal 
immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit was the second of three Wilson plans to file against the Clinton 
Administration in an attempt to force the federal government to shut down 
illegal immigration or reimburse the state for the cost of services for illegal 
immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 The first lawsuit focused on prison costs and the third is to seek funds for 
educating illegal immigrants in California's public schools. Wilson is bringing 
the suits in the federal District Court in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is time the federal government starts to enforce the nation's immigration 
laws," Wilson said at a news conference at White Memorial Medical Center in Los 
Angeles. "The federal government has failed in its basic responsibility to 
secure the border." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson said it will cost the state $369.8 million in the current fiscal year 
to provide emergency care, including obstetrics, to an estimated 309,000 
illegal immigrants. The federal government already matches the state's costs 
dollar for dollar, but Wilson wants Washington to pay the entire bill. 
</P>
<P>
 The costs have grown dramatically since Congress and former President Ronald 
Reagan made limited health care for illegal immigrants part of the federal 
MediCaid program, known as MediCal in California. Before the new law, which 
Wilson voted for as a U.S. senator, county programs for the poor and private 
health providers absorbed the cost of such care. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson's critics say the governor is using the issue to drum up support in an 
election year. But the Republican governor notes that the Democratic chief 
executives of Texas, New York and Florida also have either filed similar 
lawsuits or are considering doing so. "This is not a partisan issue," he said.

INVESTORS DEMAND ANSWERS ON FIRST PENSION, GET NONE; HEARING: PRINCIPALS IN 
ALLEGED FRAUD FAIL TO SHOW UP FOR HEARING, WHERE THEY WERE TO TESTIFY ON WHAT 
HAPPENED TO $124 MILLION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 In a raucous session punctuated by angry outbursts, about 150 investors in 
failed First Pension Corp. packed a U.S. Bankruptcy Court hearing room in Santa 
Ana on Tuesday, demanding that officials tell them where their money went. 
</P>
<P>
 They got little satisfaction. Trustee James Joseph could report only that a 
new administrator may take over the accounts of the Irvine-based pension 
management firm, which has filed for liquidation. 
</P>
<P>
 The main purpose of the hearing was to question the company's top executives 
under oath. But none of the three principals -- William E. Cooper, Robert E. 
Lindley and Valerie Jensen -- attended. 
</P>
<P>
 "You've read that the principals are cooperating, but I can tell you they are 
not cooperating with me, despite numerous requests, and they will not talk to 
me," Joseph said during a hearing that was interrupted frequently by questions 
shouted at him from the assembled investors and creditors. "Our knowledge is 
limited because people who know the story aren't telling it." 
</P>
<P>
 The Securities and Exchange Commission has alleged that First Pension's owners 
operated an elaborate pyramid scheme, leading clients to invest in mortgages 
that did not exist. As much as $124 million of 8,000 investors' money may have 
been lost to fraud and outright theft, investigators say. 
</P>
<P>
 Joseph said he is in discussions with California Central Trust Bank, a Costa 
Mesa trust company known as Cal-Trust that has about $155.7 million in assets, 
to take over management of the investors' accounts. 
</P>
<P>
 That news, however, did little to ease investors' concerns. Most of those in 
court Tuesday -- especially those who invested in second trust deed mortgage 
pools -- went away angry and frustrated. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel like I'm walking out of here with no hope," said Pia Mashour, who said 
she invested $60,000 through First Pension in the mortgage pools. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't get a single answer today," said Mary Ann Newfield, a Hollywood 
resident who invested $120,000 in pension money and an inheritance through 
First Pension's parent company, First Diversified Financial Services. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel sick," said Newfield, who is unemployed. "I just want to get out a 
razor blade. This is all the money I've scrimped and saved in the world." 
</P>
<P>
 Receivers have discovered two small insurance policies held by a First Pension 
affiliate that might cover some investor claims. 
</P>
<P>
 The court-appointed receiver for Summit Trust Services, a Denver-based firm 
established by Cooper to handle his clients' money, said Summit held both a 
bond to cover as much as $1 million in forgery and theft claims and a $1 
million policy to cover liability claims against the company's directors and 
officers. 
</P>
<P>
 But investors who asked about those policies Tuesday were told it was still 
unclear who the beneficiaries would be. Further, Andrew C. Snyder, trustee for 
Summit Trust Services, said he has only about 30% -- or about $9 million -- of 
the estimated $32 million held by Summit for First Pension clients. 
</P>
<P>
 Another hearing on the case is scheduled for June 28.

THE ECONOMY: HOW STRONG?; HOME SALES AND CONSUMER SPENDING FALL; INDICATORS: 
APRIL FIGURES OFFER EVIDENCE THAT THE FED'S STRATEGY OF RAISING INTEREST RATES 
TO CONTROL GROWTH IS WORKING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID W. MYERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Commerce Department said Tuesday that new home sales fell 6.8% in April 
while overall consumer spending also declined, providing fresh evidence that 
the Federal Reserve Board's controversial strategy of raising interest rates to 
keep the economy from overheating appears to be working. 
</P>
<P>
 Government analysts and private economists alike blamed the slowdown in U.S. 
home sales on higher mortgage rates, which began to rise sharply just after the 
central bank began pushing up short-term interest rates in February.  
</P>
<P>
 New home sales in the West, where California accounts for about half of all 
construction activity, fell 5.7% from March. 
</P>
<P>
 In a separate report, the department said overall consumer spending -- which 
accounts for about two-thirds of the nation's economic growth -- slipped 0.1% 
in April from March, as many Americans put away their credit cards and took out 
fewer loans. The decline in spending came despite a healthy 0.4% increase in 
the average family's income. 
</P>
<P>
 And in a sign that higher interest rates are shaking some Americans' faith in 
the future of the economy, the business-funded Conference Board said consumer 
confidence dropped in May after having risen in the two previous months. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Fed raised rates to cool off the economy, and that's exactly what is 
happening now," said David Seiders, chief economist for the National Assn. of 
Home Builders in Washington. "Everyone is going to be watching over the next 
few months to see just how cool the economy will get." 
</P>
<P>
 Most analysts said Tuesday's three reports are the latest evidence that the 
economy is slowing to a sustainable growth rate -- in the 3% annual range from 
its breakneck 7% in the last three months of 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have begun a transition here, moving from an economy that was growing too 
fast to an economy that is growing at a rate it can handle for two or three 
more years," said Joe Carson, Dean Witter Reynolds' chief economist in New 
York. "People shouldn't get worried about this slowdown. They should welcome 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 The April drop in new home sales was blamed largely on a rise in 30-year 
mortgage rates, which have climbed sharply since the Fed started pushing 
short-term rates higher four months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Mortgage rates stood at about 7% when the Fed launched the first of four 
increases in the federal funds rate in early February. They have since risen to 
about 8.5%, which has added more than $150 to the monthly cost of a $150,000 
new home loan. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of first-time buyers who were shopping for a new home just a few months 
ago have been knocked out of the market by the higher rates," said Seiders, the 
builders economist. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Seiders agreed that the Fed's rate increases should keep the economy 
from overheating, he added that the higher rates will be especially costly to 
the construction industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Seiders had originally forecast that 1.228 million houses would be built in 
the United States this year, but he recently lowered that estimate by 56,000 -- 
a reduction that would lead to the estimated loss of some 110,000 construction 
jobs in 1994 and thousands more in related industries. 
</P>
<P>
 The Commerce Department report showing that overall spending by consumers 
slipped 0.1% in April from March shows that would-be home buyers are not the 
only ones tightening their purse strings. 
</P>
<P>
 Spending on a broad range of items -- from food and fuel to new cars and 
appliances -- fell for only the second time in 13 months, even though the 
typical American's income from wages and investments climbed 0.4%. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people get nervous when they see interest rates go up, so they put their 
wallets away and avoid going into more debt until they start feeling a little 
better again," said Robert Barr, deputy chief economist of the U.S. Chamber of 
Commerce in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Barr said many consumers may also have been strapped for cash after paying 
their federal income taxes, which were due April 15. He noted that disposable 
income -- the money left over after federal and state taxes are paid -- fell 
0.2% in April after rising a strong 0.6% in March. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, Americans clearly seem to be getting increasingly jittery about 
the future of the economy. 
</P>
<P>
 The Conference Board said Tuesday that its consumer confidence index slipped 
to 87.6 in May from 92.1 in April. It was the first time since February that 
the index registered a decline. New Home Sales

THE ECONOMY: HOW STRONG?; JOBS-INFLATION LINK BY FED CALLED FLAWED; POLICY: 
CRITICS SAY GOVERNMENT, WALL STREET USE OUTDATED FIGURES TO DETERMINE 'FULL' 
EMPLOYMENT THRESHOLD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN PETERSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With nearly 14 million Americans out of work, marooned in part-time jobs or 
too disheartened to answer a help-wanted ad, could the United States be 
approaching "full" employment? 
</P>
<P>
 Key Federal Reserve officials, along with many on Wall Street, believe that -- 
as a practical matter -- the answer is yes: that the economy has entered a 
danger zone where further jobs growth could set off an upward spiral of 
inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 That belief, which has helped justify four interest rate hikes this year and 
may hasten the next one, has sparked a controversy that goes to the very core 
of the U.S. economy's capabilities in a world of changing technology and global 
business links. 
</P>
<P>
 "How would an average person in California respond to the notion that somehow 
we're growing too fast and have to slow the economy down?" asks Lawrence 
Mishel, research director at the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal think 
tank. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics say the Fed is relying on an outdated world view that has failed to 
consider sweeping changes that are likely to keep the lid on inflation as 
joblessness shrinks further. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, the jobs-versus-prices flap comes at a time when the labor market, 
despite significant gains, still has pockets of distress. 
</P>
<P>
 While the national unemployment rate in April was pegged at 6.4%, that is just 
an average figure. The experience of regions, racial groups and industries 
differs drastically. 
</P>
<P>
 In California, almost 1.5 million people are looking for work, and the 
unemployment rate is 9.6%, according to state data. By contrast, the rate in 
North Carolina is 3.9%. 
</P>
<P>
 Nationally, the rate of unemployment among whites is 5.6%, according to the 
Bureau of Labor Statistics. But the black unemployment rate is 11.8%, and the 
Latino rate is 10.8%. 
</P>
<P>
 One in three Americans still believes that jobs are "hard to get," the 
Conference Board reported Tuesday, a slight increase from April. 
</P>
<P>
 Given the disparities of fortune, the question of when to slow the economy 
through interest rate hikes takes on huge personal and political ramifications. 
</P>
<P>
 "You'd hate to throw away 500,000 jobs that it might not be necessary to throw 
away," observed Laurence H. Meyer, an economic forecaster in St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, what Fed officials abhor most is the prospect of inflation, which 
could unhinge the financial markets and undermine the entire recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 They have lately become concerned that the economy is running out of "slack" 
-- unused factory capacity and available workers. The jobless rate has been on 
a downward trend for almost two years, dipping to 6.4% in April from 6.7% in 
January. 
</P>
<P>
 Factories, meanwhile, have been humming, another sign that the economy 
continues to push forward at high speed: Operating rates have churned up to 
83%, closing in on the traditional inflation threshold of about 85%. 
</P>
<P>
 As the economy runs out of slack, goes the view, shortages of labor and 
materials lead to inflation. And inflation erodes the value of bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's important is that the country has removed an awful lot of slack in the 
economy," said Robert Parry, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San 
Francisco, in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
 Parry doubts that anyone can pinpoint the precise unemployment rate that 
triggers inflation, but he suggested it lurks somewhere between 6% and 6.5%, 
and probably "in the higher part of that range." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Therein lies the dispute. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics say the Fed is counting too heavily on theories hatched in an entirely 
different era. Nowadays, they contend in a theory of their own, a range of new, 
anti-inflationary forces have transformed basic economic behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no question that this (unemployment) is what the Fed has been 
focusing on, and there is no question there are faults in their methodology," 
said Mickey D. Levy, chief financial economist with NationsBank in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Corporate cost cutting, for example, has evolved from a fad to a new business 
culture, with major implications for keeping the lid on prices. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider hiring practices: By some estimates, one in five jobs generated 
during the recovery has been temporary, saving employers much of the expense of 
permanent staffers who qualify for full benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 Global forces are also at play. More than ever, foreign workers and factories 
are ready to meet the needs of U.S. consumers when America approaches the 
limits of its own industrial capacity. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're just wrong," Robert Pollin, an economics professor at UC Riverside, 
said of the Fed's worries that America's falling unemployment rate threatens an 
inflationary spiral. "They haven't factored in the downward wage pressures from 
global competition." 
</P>
<P>
 The pressures take various forms. Robert M. Solow, a Nobel laureate economist 
at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, believes that American workers 
are "excruciatingly aware" their jobs can be shifted overseas and, therefore, 
they are reluctant to push for pay hikes than they used to be. 
</P>
<P>
 These days, if Ford and Chrysler cannot sell cars fast enough to meet demand, 
prices need not shoot up -- because Toyota or Nissan is happy to oblige. 
</P>
<P>
 The same principle may apply to the labor market in a world flooded with 
employees ready to offer their services at wages far lower than U.S. levels. 
</P>
<P>
 "If some of the world's best physicists can be hired in Russia for $100 per 
month, why should anyone pay a third-rate American physicist $50,000 a year?" 
MIT economist Lester C. Thurow recently asked in the New York Times. 
</P>
<P>
 Once upon a time, a national policy of full employment meant what it sounded 
like: The goal was a job for everybody who wanted one. 
</P>
<P>
 But it soon became clear that stubborn realities block the path to so idyllic 
a state. Employers' needs don't always dovetail with applicants' skills. 
Qualified employees may not know about job openings, and even if they do, the 
workplace may be far away. 
</P>
<P>
 On top of that, a certain number of workers always are quitting or getting 
fired. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 By the 1960s, economists counseled that an unemployment rate in the 4% range 
was the flash point for inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 Then came the youthful baby boomers, largely unsettled in life, inexperienced 
in the workplace and often lacking job skills. Estimates of the inflationary 
flash point floated toward a 7% unemployment rate. 
</P>
<P>
 Fast-forward to 1994, and the picture has changed once more. 
</P>
<P>
 Economists believe the danger zone has gotten lower, partly due to a more 
experienced work force, and peg it in a range between 5% and 6.5%. 
</P>
<P>
 But that range covers a lot of territory: The difference of 1 1/2 percentage 
points could be the difference of up to 2 million jobs, said Ross DeVol, an 
economist with the WEFA Group in suburban Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
 The debate over the correct level "is fundamentally important," he says. "The 
Fed is going to be under increasing political attack if it continues to tighten 
and there is no sign of inflation. Congress is going to be livid." 
</P>
<P>
 Just last week, Democratic lawmakers assailed the Fed for precisely that. At a 
Senate hearing, Sen. Paul S. Sarbanes (D-Md.) held up an editorial cartoon 
depicting Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan with a sign proclaiming, "The economy is 
picking up. We are doomed." 
</P>
<P>
 The issue could become even touchier in the coming weeks, in light of some new 
signs that the economy is perking along faster than expected. The Commerce 
Department recently surprised analysts by revising upward to 3% the nation's 
growth rate for the first three months of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 In any case, this much is agreed upon: A recovery once dubbed "jobless" is 
spewing out new jobs by the hundreds of thousands, and it is doing so without 
sparking wage inflation so far. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Fed is on a course of raising interest rates anyway, a strategy that 
will reduce jobs growth in the future: "To the average person on the street, 
I'd guess this doesn't make a lot of sense," DeVol said.

THE CUTTING EDGE: COMPUTING / TECHNOLOGY / INNOVATION; WHEN CHIPS ARE DOWN . . 
.; . . . IT MAY BE TIME TO ANTE UP A NEW STRATEGY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Gallium-arsenide microchips make computers run faster than the ubiquitous 
silicon chip used today. Gallium chips also need less power. On the wings of 
such promises rode the hopes of young Vitesse Semiconductor Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 Within a few months of its $9-a-share initial public offering in December, 
1991, Vitesse's stock had reached $21, giving the Camarillo-based company a 
market value of nearly $300 million. This for a tiny firm with a string of 
losses and most of its revenue from development fees. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the hope for Vitesse was pinned on its deal to supply super-fast 
semiconductors to supercomputer maker Convex Computer Corp. in Richardson, Tex. 
Some analysts predicted that by mid-decade, Vitesse could get a sizable chunk 
of a projected $1-billion-a-year market for gallium-arsenide chips. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately for Vitesse and its shareholders, things didn't work out that 
way. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago, with the recession in full swing, the supercomputer market 
headed south. Convex's orders to Vitesse plummeted, leaving the company with 
excess inventory and too much production capacity. In its fiscal year ended 
Sept. 30, the company lost $19 million and revenue plunged 30%. 
</P>
<P>
 Vitesse is a study in what can happen when a company in a fast-moving 
high-technology industry relies too heavily on a single customer. It is also a 
textbook case of the pitfalls of inflated expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Vitesse is also an example of how a company can overcome such troubles and 
turn itself around. Despite the odds, the company has engineered a recovery by 
improving its technology, cutting costs and finding new customers, including 
AT&T and Intel Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 Louis Tomasetta, the company's president and chief executive, said an 
estimated 80% of Vitesse's business is "from customers we weren't doing 
business with two years ago." 
</P>
<P>
 The company has pared its losses, boosted revenue and is expected by analysts 
to break even or earn a small profit -- its first in two years -- in the 
quarter ending June 30. They predict Vitesse's stock, now at a lowly $5 per 
share, has finally hit bottom. 
</P>
<P>
 That's just in time for the small technology company, which has seen its cash 
level dwindle to $5.2 million as of March 31, from more than $25 million after 
its stock offering. At one point, it looked as if Vitesse might go out of 
business, said Mark Edelstone, analyst at Prudential Securities in San 
Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've stayed the course, got costs under control and entered new markets," 
he said. Vitesse's liquidity is "not my concern now." 
</P>
<P>
 Vitesse still faces plenty of competition from other gallium-arsenide vendors, 
such as TriQuint Semiconductor in Beaverton, Ore. An even bigger threat comes 
from makers of high-performance silicon chips, such as Motorola Inc., Texas 
Instruments Inc. and Fujitsu Ltd., whose great strides in improving silicon 
technology have been a big reason the market for gallium-arsenide chips hasn't 
come anywhere near the $1 billion it was once expected to reach by now. 
</P>
<P>
 "Traditional silicon has carried the load much further and longer than we had 
estimated," said analyst Daniel L. Klesken at Robertson, Stephens & Co., an 
investment firm in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 But gallium-arsenide sales industrywide could soon hit several hundred million 
dollars, Klesken said, and Vitesse could grow to $200 million in annual sales 
by the end of the decade if it develops the new markets it has targeted. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Vitesse's new customers are telecommunications companies such as AT&T, 
Northern Telecom and Alcatel Canada, which use Vitesse's gallium-arsenide chips 
in the fiber-optic and high-speed switching networks they are building. 
</P>
<P>
 Telecommunications customers now account for nearly 40% of Vitesse's revenue, 
and Tomasetta sees the company's sales to that industry doubling over the next 
year as the telecommunications revolution continues apace. 
</P>
<P>
 Data communications -- the moving of information among computer networks -- is 
another new market for Vitesse. The company also hopes to sell into the 
high-end personal computer market. 
</P>
<P>
 Vitesse has begun shipping semiconductors called cache memory controllers -- 
which act like traffic cops in moving information back and forth -- to giant 
semiconductor maker Intel, which is producing a new generation of PC 
microprocessors called Pentium. 
</P>
<P>
 Vitesse has also increased sales to semiconductor testing companies, including 
Teradyne Inc., Megatest Corp. and Schlumberger Ltd. Tomasetta said only 
gallium-arsenide semiconductors can operate at speeds fast enough to test 
state-of-the-art silicon chips. That business, accounting for nearly $2 million 
in sales for Vitesse in the March 31 quarter, could grow by half over the next 
two years, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 To break into these new markets, Vitesse invested in technology to make its 
circuits even smaller and more powerful. It has also increased productivity, in 
part by reducing the infiltration of dust, which can ruin production runs. The 
company has a team of six engineers who do nothing but eliminate particles from 
equipment and find other ways to improve production yields, Tomasetta said. 
</P>
<P>
 Vitesse has also trimmed employment through attrition and layoffs, from 300 
workers at its peak two years ago to 210 today. 
</P>
<P>
 Because it is now more efficient, Tomasetta said, the company has been able to 
lower prices on some products.  
</P>
<P>
 Whereas silicon is found in abundance in ordinary sand and silicon chips can 
be cheaply produced, gallium is relatively rare, and combining it with arsenic 
is an expensive process. Prices for gallium-arsenide semiconductors range from 
$10 to $1,000 apiece and are generally about three times that of the most 
common type of silicon chip. 
</P>
<P>
 But when measured against the highest-performance silicon chips, Tomasetta 
said, Vitesse's semiconductors are still two times faster and are more 
comparably priced.

MARKET BEAT / TOM PETRUNO: U.S. INVESTORS SEE MORE GAINS AHEAD AS JAPANESE 
STOCKS JUMP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM PETRUNO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Foreign money is pouring into Japanese stocks again, convinced that the 
Japanese economy's four-year slide is over and that a robust corporate profit 
turnaround is imminent. 
</P>
<P>
 Many foreign buyers also are betting on another, perhaps more important 
turnaround: a change in Japanese investors' gloomy view of their market, which 
has left most of them watching unimpressed on the sidelines as the gaijin 
(foreigners) snap up Japanese shares. 
</P>
<P>
 The Nikkei-225 stock index has soared from 17,417.24 at year's end to 
20,973.59 as of Tuesday, a 20% gain that makes the Tokyo market among the 
world's best this year. In recent days the Nikkei has been particularly strong, 
breaking above the 20,000 mark to a nine-month high. 
</P>
<P>
 Optimism is running strong among many American portfolio managers, who believe 
that the Japanese economy is finally bottoming and that Japan therefore offers 
an opportunity to buy stocks on the ground floor of a recovery. Obviously, any 
investor who missed loading up on U.S. stocks two years ago, while the U.S. 
economy languished, doesn't want to make the same mistake twice. 
</P>
<P>
 Barton Biggs, the influential investment strategist for Morgan Stanley & Co., 
recently told clients that "the Japanese market is a buy right now." 
</P>
<P>
 Biggs' case is that Japan's many ills -- including a floundering political 
system, collapsed corporate earnings, a strong yen and horrendous hidden real 
estate loan losses at banks -- are already so well known to investors that they 
must be mostly discounted in stock prices. 
</P>
<P>
 "What isn't discounted is that Japan is still a huge, powerful economy with a 
formidable business class running world-class companies located in the center 
of the fastest growth area of the world," Biggs told clients in a May 11 
report. 
</P>
<P>
 Strictly by the numbers, Japan still looks sickly. Real economic growth, 4% in 
1991, plunged to 1.5% in 1992 and was a negative 0.1% in '93. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem last year was largely internal: Japan's wealthy consumers sharply 
reduced their spending as the country's major corporations launched 
restructuring efforts (including deep cuts in capital spending, and some 
layoffs) to cope with weaker global demand for Japanese exports. 
</P>
<P>
 In short, 1993 was the year in which corporate Japan finally acknowledged that 
the glory days of the 1980s' export era -- when Japan stood unrivaled -- were 
finished. The nation's political machine also broke down last year, ending what 
had essentially been 38 years of one-party rule. 
</P>
<P>
 The price of corporate and societal restructuring hasn't been paid in full: 
Morgan Stanley expects only 0.7% real growth in Japan this year, far below 
expected U.S. growth and even below what struggling Europe should be able to 
muster. 
</P>
<P>
 But stock markets look ahead, and that's what is happening now, say the Japan 
bulls. Merrill Lynch & Co., for example, is telling clients that Japanese 
corporate earnings could rocket 35% next year from this year's depressed 
levels. 
</P>
<P>
 Morgan Stanley's Biggs expects that revived domestic demand and faster export 
growth will lead to 5% to 6% economic growth in Japan in 1995-1996. "When that 
happens, profits should explode," Biggs contends.  
</P>
<P>
 Even so, many investors would argue that Japanese stocks already reflect 1995 
earnings gains, and more. The Japanese market's price-to-earnings ratio is an 
astronomical 70 now, based on estimated 1994 earnings per share. Even cut in 
half, the Japanese P-E would be 35, far above the 15 to 20 P-Es of most world 
markets. 
</P>
<P>
 The bulls contend that the P-E argument isn't important, and not just because 
Japanese stocks have always sold for high P-Es. Adjust for accounting 
differences and look at real, cash earnings of Japanese companies, and many 
Japanese stocks appear quite reasonably priced, says John Hickling, one of 
Fidelity Investments' senior international managers. 
</P>
<P>
 By Morgan Stanley's figuring, Japanese stocks now sell for 7.8 times estimated 
1995 cash earnings, versus 8.3 times for U.S. stocks. 
</P>
<P>
 Hickling, who manages Fidelity's Japan stock fund and Overseas stock fund, 
says "a lot of the (Japanese) stocks I own sell for less than 10 times 1994 
cash flow," which is cheap if you consider how depressed profits still are this 
year, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the Japanese market looks terrific," Hickling says, and he's focused 
in particular on industrial giants such as Toyota. "You just have to look at 
what they've done to their cost base" to see rich future profit potential 
there, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 William Stack, manager of the Lexington Global fund, also believes that 
Japan's leading industrial firms are poised for stunning turnarounds. "One of 
my strongest investment convictions today is Japanese cyclical stocks," says 
Stack, whose fund owns issues such as Toyota and Honda Motor. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet beyond the obvious potential pitfalls in the bullish case on Japan -- 
another dive in the economy, or a further strengthening of the overvalued yen 
-- there's one glaring problem: The Japanese themselves aren't buying stock. 
</P>
<P>
 Still traumatized by their four-year bear market, Japanese regard the latest 
market surge as the work of "silly gaijin ," says Jamie Rosenwald, whose 
Redondo Beach-based Rosenwald Capital Management has long been active in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosenwald is going to Japan next week, specifically to look for hints that 
cash-rich Japanese institutions are ready to move back into stocks. If he can't 
find evidence of a change in sentiment, Rosenwald admits he will have to 
reconsider his bullish view of the market. After all, he notes, the Nikkei 
bounced from 16,000 to 20,000 a year ago, only to slump again in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
 If domestic investors join in, the Nikkei could hit 25,000 in a hurry, 
Rosenwald says. Without them, "This rally could fizzle real quickly," he warns. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Lindsell, Tokyo-based manager of the GT Global Japan stock fund, says 
there are some signs that the Japanese want to buy stocks again, but that most 
investors there are wary -- himself included. "I am pretty suspicious about a 
wholehearted (economic) recovery," he admits. 
</P>
<P>
 The question thus is, who has a better view of Japan's future -- the 
downtrodden Japanese, or the outsiders looking in? Hot Streak 
</P>
<P>
 Tokyo stocks have rallied sharply this year, and now are at their highest 
levels since September.

 Nissan Motor Co. Returns to Profit: Japan's second-biggest car maker reported 
that it was back in the black for the fiscal year ended in March, but the 
company predicted that it will merely break even for fiscal 1995 as near-term 
business conditions remain tough.Nissan reported a current profit for its 
parent of $39.4 million for the year, contrasted with a loss of $252 million 
for the previous year. The company had a profit of $843 million for fiscal 
1992. Heiichi Hamaoka, an executive managing director for Nissan, attributed 
the turnaround to cost cutting.

VIDEO GAME DELIVERY SYSTEM TO GET A TRYOUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY HARMON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Imagine walking into a video store on a Saturday night and actually finding 
the movie you want still in stock. 
</P>
<P>
 That may be asking a bit much, but NewLeaf Entertainment and Sega of America 
on Tuesday announced plans to test-market a software delivery system in some 
Blockbuster outlets this summer that could provide such satisfaction to video 
game renters. 
</P>
<P>
 The system lets video rental firms store encrypted video game software 
electronically and download it to special cartridges in less than 30 seconds. 
The cartridges can be reprogrammed with different games an unlimited number of 
times. 
</P>
<P>
 The system -- developed by NewLeaf and Fairway Technologies, joint ventures of 
Blockbuster Entertainment Corp. and IBM Corp. -- is similar to the one the two 
firms tried to interest the music industry in last year. That system would have 
allowed consumers to select the compact discs they want, then press them in the 
store. 
</P>
<P>
 The goal with both systems is to allow retailers to match inventory to 
consumer demand. 
</P>
<P>
 The recording companies, concerned about licensing, piracy and quality 
control, nearly unanimously rejected the new technology, but the video game 
industry appears more willing to embrace it. Game rental has ballooned to a 
$1.5-billion business. As with movie rentals, the new hit games are always the 
first to go. 
</P>
<P>
 Industry sources estimate that about a third of the customers who want to rent 
games go away empty-handed because the ones they wanted had already been 
checked out. "This system ensures that every customer will be satisfied," said 
Tom Kalkinske, chief executive of Sega. 
</P>
<P>
 Nintendo officials said the company had declined to participate in the test 
but would not rule out using the system in the future. Initially limited to 
cartridges, the system can be expanded to allow for electronic delivery of 
CD-ROM-based games as well. 
</P>
<P>
 If it works, the technology could be a boon to Blockbuster, whose core 
business is threatened as electronic delivery of movies directly to the home 
looms. The test will start in August in 10 to 15 stores in the Southeast and 
could be rolled out nationally in the fall.

O'LEARY MAY BACK ALASKA EXPORTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A move to lift a ban on oil exports from Alaska got tentative support from the 
secretary of energy Tuesday, but an aide to U.S. Sen. Patty Murray said the ban 
would stand if challenged on the Senate floor. 
</P>
<P>
 Murray (D-Wash.) is fighting to make the ban permanent. 
</P>
<P>
 Under current law, oil from Alaska's North Slope must be sold in the United 
States, a condition imposed when the trans-Alaskan pipeline was approved by 
Congress in the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
 The Department of Energy is expected to release a study later this month on 
the costs and benefits of lifting the ban. 
</P>
<P>
 Petroleum refiners and consumer groups support the ban because they believe 
West Coast oil prices would soar if North Slope crude could be sold abroad. 
Selling Alaska's production abroad would make oil scarcer in the United States 
and, the groups argue, more expensive. 
</P>
<P>
 Murray, whose constituents include Tosco Corp., which owns a refinery in her 
state, is up against California oil companies and British Petroleum, which 
favor lifting the ban. BP wants to sell oil in Far Eastern markets from its 
part-owned Prudhoe Bay, Alaska, field, while California oil producers think a 
price rise could spur new drilling in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 Secretary of Energy Hazel O'Leary, speaking at a meeting of the New York 
Society of Security Analysts in New York, said that if lifting the ban "is not 
detrimental to the economies of Alaska and California," she would support 
removing it. 
</P>
<P>
 Major maritime unions have removed objections to lifting the ban. Unions that 
now support lifting it include the Seafarers International Union, the American 
Maritime Officers and the International Organization of Masters, Mates & 
Pilots.

 IDB Communications Group Inc. Auditor Quits: The company said Deloitte & 
Touche resigned after the accounting firm "questioned various adjustments" in 
IDB's first-quarter financial statements. IDB, a fast-growing Los Angeles-based 
telecommunications firm, is headed by Jeffrey P. Sudikoff, who recently joined 
with entertainment industry executive Joseph Cohen to buy a 72% stake in the 
L.A. Kings from financially troubled owner Bruce McNall.In filing with the 
Securities and Exchange Commission, IDB said Deloitte & Touche resigned May 23 
because it said parts of IDB's first-quarter financial statements were not 
properly documented. A spokeswoman for Deloitte & Touche declined to comment 
and referred calls to IDB. IDB said its first-quarter statements "appropriately 
reflect all business transactions and adjustments necessary for a fair 
presentation of the financial position and the results of operations."

22% OF UNITED WORKERS WILL WAIT TO JOIN BUYOUT EFFORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 UAL Corp. employees represented by the Assn. of Flight Attendants will not 
join a $4.9-billion employee buyout effort before a shareholder vote this 
summer, the union said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gerald Greenwald, who will become chairman and chief executive of UAL if 
shareholders approve the sale, told the AFA last week that there is not enough 
time to conclude an agreement with the union before the referendum, according 
to the union. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for the union, which represents 18,000 United Airlines employees, 
or 22% of the airline's 83,000 workers, could not be reached for comment. A 
company spokesman was also unavailable. 
</P>
<P>
 The International Assn. of Machinists, the Air Line Pilots Assn. and a 
non-union employee group have signed a definitive agreement to buy 55% of the 
company in exchange for a $4.9-billion package of wage and work-rule 
concessions over almost six years. 
</P>
<P>
 The AFA and United have been deadlocked over the airline's use of foreign 
bases for flight attendants, which the union says reduces demand for its 
members' jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether or not the AFA joins the buyout will be another uncertainty for 
shareholders when they cast ballots for or against the sale, which would create 
the nation's largest employee-owned company. 
</P>
<P>
 UAL Corp. has lowered its estimate of what shareholders will get from an 
employee buyout a second time, citing changes made to pacify pilots. The UAL 
board now values the deal at $143 to $147 a share for existing stockholders, 
down from as much as $170 a share in late December. 
</P>
<P>
 Since a definitive agreement was reached March 25, UAL's share price has 
fallen 9.6%. It closed 75 cents higher at $119.875 on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Also unclear is who the company will pick as president to run the airline, as 
Greenwald has no airline operating experience. Few expect the position to be 
filled before the shareholder vote.

TOBACCO GIANTS MAY TURN TO BANKRUPTCY, EXPERTS SAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Cigarette makers, among the most profitable U.S. companies, may end up turning 
to the bankruptcy courts for protection against an expected surge in 
smoking-related lawsuits, legal experts say. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week two states took steps against tobacco producers to make them pay for 
health costs arising from smoking. 
</P>
<P>
 Philip Morris Cos. and R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. played down the chances of 
taking the bankruptcy route. 
</P>
<P>
 But lawyers see a chance for a repeat of the move that saved asbestos makers 
from the worst financial effects of cancer-related lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tobacco companies are very healthy. They're robust. Yet they could find 
themselves contemplating bankruptcy if civil lawsuits turn against them," said 
Elizabeth Warren, who teaches bankruptcy law at the University of Pennsylvania. 
</P>
<P>
 Another law professor, Daniel Polsby of Northwestern University, likens the 
companies' current situation to "a balloon in a room full of needles." 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyers said the situation is reminiscent of the flood of asbestos-injury 
lawsuits that pushed Manville Corp., until then financially healthy, into 
filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 1982. The company had been 
called Johns-Manville when it made asbestos. 
</P>
<P>
 Under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy code, a company retains control of 
its businesses while it reorganizes and settles debts with its creditors. Such 
bankruptcy protection can also be used to shelter a company's assets from 
massive legal claims, as occurred in the case of Manville, which is again 
financially sound. 
</P>
<P>
 For tobacco companies, such a move could be years away and depends on whether 
the manufacturers start losing cases. But just a few defeats for the 
once-invincible industry could lead to a rapid preemptive strike, the legal 
experts predict. 
</P>
<P>
 "You'll see them contemplating bankruptcy when they've lost only a few 
lawsuits if they perceive on the horizon there are literally tens of thousands 
of lawsuits. It will be an anticipatory move, a strategy," Warren said. 
</P>
<P>
 But a spokesman for Philip Morris said the company does not think it will lose 
any of the civil actions and that the industry's situation is not comparable to 
that of asbestos makers'. 
</P>
<P>
 Manville emerged from bankruptcy in 1988 after pioneering the use of 
bankruptcy protection to set up a trust to pay massive personal injury claims. 
</P>
<P>
 A.H. Robins Co., which made the ill-fated Dalkon Shield contraceptive device, 
took a similar route when it filed for bankruptcy protection in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
 "Johns-Manville and Robins have simply blazed the path for how to do that in a 
mass tort situation. This would be an ideal setting" for tobacco companies, 
Warren said. 
</P>
<P>
 Victor Han, the Philip Morris spokesman, said tobacco companies are not at the 
same risk because they have never paid a penny stemming from a judgment against 
them. He said the state actions are fundamentally the same as other cases the 
industry has won.

JAPAN ACCUSES U.S. OF UNFAIR TRADE STANCE; RELATIONS: REPORT CRITICIZES 
CLINTON'S REINSTITUTION OF A LAW ALLOWING RETALIATION AGAINST IMPORTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 In another indication of its continued tough stance toward American trade 
demands, Japan released a report Tuesday accusing the United States of unfair 
trade practices. 
</P>
<P>
 "The United States is without parallel in imposing measures that force its 
trading partners to abide by unilateral judgments, and shows no sign of 
abandoning this practice," the 333-page report charges. It also summarizes what 
Japan sees as unfair practices by nine of its other major trading partners. 
</P>
<P>
 The report, prepared by an advisory committee of the Ministry of International 
Trade and Industry, harshly criticizes President Clinton's reinstitution in 
March of the "Super 301" trade law, which allows U.S. retaliation against 
Japanese imports should Japan fail to further open its market to foreign goods. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the same country serves as both prosecutor and judge, one must assume 
that due process is lacking," the report says. 
</P>
<P>
 It is the third year Japan has produced this kind of report, which serves as a 
counterattack on an annual U.S. report on foreign trade barriers. The U.S. 
report, released March 31, singled out Japan for the most severe criticism and 
could ultimately lead to sanctions. The Japanese report, in turn, lists more 
categories of unfair practices by the United States than by any other country.  
</P>
<P>
 Taken together, the two reports demonstrate how officials of the two countries 
largely continue to talk past each other when discussing trade. 
</P>
<P>
 The underlying theme of the Japanese report is that trade issues should be 
settled according to international rules as embodied in the General Agreement 
on Tariffs and Trade and its successor, the World Trade Organization. However, 
U.S. complaints about trade barriers in Japan primarily concern features of 
Japan's economic structure that are not covered by GATT rules. 
</P>
<P>
 Tokyo and Washington agreed last week to resume trade talks that broke down in 
February, but basic conceptual disputes between the two sides remain. From the 
U.S. perspective, the purpose of the talks is to agree on ways to further open 
Japan's market to reduce Japan's $60-billion merchandise trade surplus with the 
United States and its $131-billion global surplus in trade of goods and 
services.  
</P>
<P>
 The Japanese report, however, dismisses core U.S. arguments in almost 
condescending terms. It is especially critical of demands to address detailed 
"microeconomic" issues as a means of redressing trade imbalances. In the trade 
"framework" talks now being resumed, a key American focus is on specific 
sectors, including automobiles and auto parts, insurance, and government 
procurement of telecommunications and medical equipment. These sectoral talks 
formally resume today with insurance negotiations in Tokyo; auto talks reopen 
Thursday in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Japanese report rejects the conceptual basis for these talks. "A quick 
perusal of almost any economics textbook will confirm that microeconomic 
policies for individual sectors are not effective means of resolving trade 
imbalances," it says. The report also states that "in purely economic terms, 
there is no need to resolve . . . trade imbalances." 
</P>
<P>
 The report's charges of U.S. discrimination against foreign competitors run 
the gamut from unfair enforcement of anti-dumping actions to patent law. 
</P>
<P>
 Some complaints are remarkably detailed. For example, the report charges that 
U.S. restrictions on the export of logs cut from federal forests, imposed to 
protect the endangered spotted owl, are a violation of GATT rules. While log 
exports are restricted, lumber exports are encouraged, it charges, suggesting 
that WTO dispute settlement procedures could be invoked to demand a change. 
</P>
<P>
 "Conservation of spotted owls should be accomplished instead by restrictions 
on deforestation," the report says. "The U.S. measures are actually . . . 
restrictions implemented to protect domestic lumber mills."

 FDIC Joins Campaign to Limit Insider Profits on S&L Stock: Under pressure from 
Congress, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. has joined the Office of Thrift 
Supervision in proposing rules aimed at limiting windfall profits for insiders 
when depositor-owned savings and loans, so-called mutual S&Ls, offer stock to 
the public. The tougher rules are aimed at S&L managers who reap excessive 
gains by setting the stock offering price well below the true value of the 
institution so that it rises rapidly after stock is sold to the public.Insiders 
have obtained big shares of stock subscriptions at low prices and, in some 
cases, huge compensation packages. The proposed rules would give depositors 
control over any decision to convert to stock ownership or to award 
compensation to managers.

 Cost-of-Funds Index at 3.672%: Rises Slightly: The Federal Home Loan Bank of 
San Francisco said the monthly weighted average cost-of-funds index for 11th 
District savings institutions for April was 3.672%.The index for March was 
3.629%. Changes in interest rates on adjustable-rate mortgage loans offered by 
many savings institutions and commercial banks are tied to changes in the 
index. The cost-of-funds index reflects the interest paid by savings 
institutions in Arizona, California and Nevada on their various sources of 
mortgage money.

 UAW Strikes Chrysler Technology Center: About 850 salaried workers at the 
Auburn Hills, Mich., center went on strike, said David Corliss, 
secretary-treasurer of United Auto Workers Local 412.The unit represents 
primarily designers, analysts and clay modelers. Talks between that unit and 
Chrysler have been suspended, he said. A second bargaining unit representing 
more than 400 workers reached a tentative agreement on a contract just before 
the strike deadline, he said. That group includes maintenance workers, skilled 
trades workers and builders of wood, metal and plastic prototype models.

INSURER TO END BIAS AGAINST ABUSE VICTIMS; COVERAGE: STATE FARM RESPONDS TO 
CRITICISM THAT NATION'S LARGEST CARRIERS DENY POLICIES TO WOMEN BEATEN BY THEIR 
HUSBANDS.

 Effective immediately, victims of domestic violence will generally receive the 
same treatment as other applicants for health and life coverage from State Farm 
Insurance, the company said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The announcement came less than three weeks after women's rights activists and 
a lawmaker contended that some of the nation's largest insurers routinely deny 
insurance coverage to women who have been beaten by their husbands. 
</P>
<P>
 State Farm, based in Bloomington, Ill., has begun providing its life and 
health insurance operations with domestic violence guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
 "There haven't been statistics available for us to make pricing or eligibility 
decisions or for anyone to speak conclusively on this issue," said Glenn Britt, 
State Farm executive vice president. 
</P>
<P>
 "But recent attention to this issue has caused us to give our agents and 
employees some guidance," he said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
 State Farm said that under its new guidelines, domestic violence is not a 
reason to deny coverage, except in extreme cases where the violence is 
"current, repeated and life-threatening." In those instances, State Farm will 
review each application case by case. 
</P>
<P>
 State Farm will work with Rep. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.), chairman of the 
House criminal justice subcommittee, to gather figures and identify an 
organization the insurer can support to help combat domestic violence. 
</P>
<P>
 Schumer and activists said last month that they estimated the practice of 
denying coverage had affected thousands of women and discouraged others from 
reporting beatings and other abuse to their doctors and the police. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a very big difference in State Farm policy," said Melanie Sloan, the 
subcommittee's counsel. "Generally, if you just have an incident or two of 
domestic violence in your past, you no longer will have a problem. Even in an 
extreme situation, you may be insured by State Farm." 
</P>
<P>
 A survey by Schumer's subcommittee staff found that eight of 16 insurance 
companies polled acknowledged they may reject an applicant because she had been 
beaten by her husband or partner. 
</P>
<P>
 State Farm worked with Schumer, and the subcommittee sent letters May 18 to 
the seven other companies; only State Farm has responded. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this will influence everybody," Sloan said of State Farm's action.

 Name: Jonathan Seybold Age: 51 Education: Bachelor's from Oberlin College; 
graduate work in economics at Yale University Title: Founder of Seybold 
Seminars, publisher of the Seybold Reports Family: Seybold and his wife, 
Patricia, were high school sweethearts. They have two daughters. Interests: 
Ocean kayaking, hiking, telecommuting from his homes in Malibu and Santa Fe, 
N.M. Hardware: Two Macintosh Centras (610 and 650), two CD-ROM drives, one 
Macintosh PowerBook, one IBM-compatible 486, three cellular phones, three 
digital answering machines, two surround-sound theater set-ups with laser disc 
players.

<P>
 Jonathan Seybold organized the first Digital World conference four years ago, 
in the dark ages when superhighways were still for cars. Back then, Seybold's 
vision of converging industries and digital revolution sounded far-fetched to 
many of the computing, cable, telecommunications, publishing and entertainment 
executives for whom he consulted. 
</P>
<P>
 Things have changed. This year, any conference with "digital" in its title -- 
and there were way too many of them -- drew crowds of true believers. Amid the 
hype, Digital World has retained more credibility than the rest. The 
conference, which runs next Monday through Wednesday, moves from the Beverly 
Hills Hilton to the Los Angeles Convention Center this year. It will include 
for the first time a media festival showcasing the 27 best applications of 
interactive technology as selected by a panel of inter-industry judges. 
</P>
<P>
 Ziff Davis acquired Seybold's company in 1990 and last year closed its Malibu 
operations in a consolidation move. Seybold says the change has freed him of 
management duties, allowing him to spend his time on research, consulting and 
networking. We caught up with him in Malibu, where he maintains a virtual 
office. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Q: Over the last year we've seen this frenzy of alliance making and merger 
announcements, only to watch a lot of them fall apart. At the same time, a 
bunch of the high-profile new-media stocks have collapsed. Has the digital 
revolution lost momentum? 
</P>
<P>
 A: No. It was entirely predictable. This may even happen a second time. People 
habitually overestimate the speed with which something happens in the short run 
and underestimate the impact in the long run. And then reality sets in and 
people say: "Hey, this is going to be hard. This is going to take a long time." 
And you know revolutions -- people get hurt in revolutions. So things come back 
down to earth. But in the meantime, we have quadrupled the number of home 
computers equipped with CD-ROM drives this past year. There is for the first 
time a real market for interactive CD-ROMs. The Internet is gaining a million 
users a month. So in the midst of all that hype there was actually a lot 
happening. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What advice can you give people who are trying to separate the hype from 
the reality? 
</P>
<P>
 A: The first bit of advice is to think of this as something that's going to 
take a couple of decades to play out. Take a deep breath and look at it in that 
perspective. The second thing you have to do is acknowledge the fact that 
business has probably irrevocably changed and that alliances and relationships 
are going to be a permanent fact of business from now on. The third thing I 
would say is that we are in the period of the fighting for who gets to have the 
power positions and who gets to set the standards. That is going to be a 
brutal, very rough fight. There's a huge amount of jockeying that's going on 
with the phone companies and the cable companies, and what is going to happen 
out of that will set the rules by which the infrastructure gets developed. And 
there's nothing inevitable about these arrangements. There's no technological 
deus ex machina . 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: So if you had to guess, who's going to win? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Right now it looks as if the phone companies are in by far the stronger 
position and the cable industry is in a much weaker position. But that's only 
happened since October. That's how fast these things change. And I don't think 
anyone's willing to bet that we've seen the last, you know, the last shift in 
this stuff. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What is the biggest obstacle left to rolling out the information 
superhighway? 
</P>
<P>
 A: There are two of them. The first one is working out the legal and 
regulatory framework. No one knows what rules we'll be playing by and therefore 
exactly how they can or can't make the investment. The second issue is that the 
pipelines are only just that -- they're pipelines. They don't do anything. What 
does something is what you do with them in terms of building the computer 
servers and connecting into them the home computers and the television set-top 
boxes and so forth. And what we're talking about there is developing and 
installing computer systems which are thousands of times more powerful than 
those which we've installed in offices. And putting a significant portion of 
our population on line to these computer systems -- people who can't program 
their VCR. This is a huge technical challenge. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: When will average Americans see concrete evidence of the info highway in 
their own lives? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Some Americans are already seeing it. I'm amazed at the number of people 
who are going onto on-line computer services, considering that most of these 
are at best user-hostile. And the Internet is defiantly user-hostile. There's 
not going to be a big bang. It's going to start nibbling around the edges of 
peoples' lives. People will start giving you their business cards with their 
e-mail address on it. There'll be a lot of experimentation. But as for when the 
average consumer in Westwood or Van Nuys is going to get video on demand, it's 
going to be awhile. The best case I see is that it's going to be into the next 
decade before we pass, in most service areas, a point at which more than half 
the people have access to broad-band services. But of course you don't need the 
whole population on line to have a real market. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What do you picture when you think of a "digital world"? 
</P>
<P>
 A: It's a world in which we have separated the content from the carrier. 
Everything is digital. Everything can be mixed. Everything can be transmitted. 
Everything can be interacted with. We're taught to value something because of 
the physical embodiment of it. We're taught to think of a book or a movie we 
rent as the cassette tape that we take from the video rental place -- as though 
that is what has value. But in reality it isn't what has value at all. What has 
value is the intangible data that's on that tape or embodied in that book. It 
doesn't matter whether it comes to you on tape or a card or a piece of paper. 
It's a fundamental shifting of thinking.

THE CUTTING EDGE: COMPUTING / TECHNOLOGY / INNOVATION; PLOWSHARES; LOCKHEED 
FOCUSES ON NEW 'LIQUID LENSES' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES F. PELTZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Look inside an expensive camera lens and you'll typically find glass -- 
elaborately ground and coated glass that enables the photographer to shoot in 
wide angles, at close range or in poor light, depending on the type of lens 
used. 
</P>
<P>
 But Lockheed Corp. hopes to produce better, cheaper lenses by using a 
different medium: liquid. 
</P>
<P>
 Lockheed's optics researchers in Palo Alto, led by senior designer Robert 
Sigler, have invented "liquid lenses" that they say can dramatically reduce the 
cost of powerful camera lenses, telescopes and binoculars while enhancing the 
devices' capabilities. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, Lockheed says it can produce a 300mm telephoto camera lens using 
materials -- including liquids and glass -- that cost $152, compared to the 
$1,100 for conventional glass elements and other materials needed to make the 
same lens. 
</P>
<P>
 The liquid lens technology is derived from research Sigler's team conducted on 
night-vision rifle scopes for the military. Lockheed has already licensed the 
technology to several camera and telescope manufacturers -- it won't identify 
them yet -- and the first commercial telescope using liquid lenses should reach 
the market by year's end, Sigler said. 
</P>
<P>
 When light passes through a basic high-powered lens, the light's colors are 
spread apart, much like in a prism, in what is called chromatic aberration. To 
correct the aberration, obtain a sharp image and achieve the desired effect 
(wide angle, telephoto, etc.), the lens makers cement multiple lens elements 
together or mount them at carefully calculated positions inside the lens 
chamber. 
</P>
<P>
 They often take one other step to correct for the color dispersion: They use 
specialized lens elements known as apochromats, which are made from glass or 
crystal. But apochromats are expensive, difficult to handle and unavailable in 
large sizes, Sigler said. 
</P>
<P>
 Liquids don't have those drawbacks, and Sigler's team developed ways to 
replace the apochromatic elements with sealed liquids. Lockheed says the liquid 
design allows for a lens with fewer components and reduces the need for 
elaborately precise finishes and exotic coatings on the lens elements that 
remain -- all of which lowers the cost. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't worry: The liquids don't slosh around inside the lens. A large lens 
would require no more than a cubic centimeter of liquid. 
</P>
<P>
 And what liquid does Sigler use? He won't say, citing proprietary concerns. 
But he allowed that it's clear like water but much thicker, a bit like corn 
syrup. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's just say I wouldn't drink it," Sigler said. JAMES F. PELTZ

IN DEVELOPMENT: THE CUTTING EDGE: COMPUTING / TECHNOLOGY / INNOVATION; AIRING 
OUT CONTAMINATED SOIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHLEEN WIEGNER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A breath or two of fresh air seems to do wonders for contaminated soil. So say 
researchers at the New Jersey Institute of Technology in Newark and at 
Battelle, an independent research center in Columbus, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
 The New Jersey researchers have developed a new technique, called pneumatic 
fracturing, that uses a controlled burst of air to drive contaminants out of 
soil and rock formations. The controlled burst of air acts something like a 
drill, widening naturally occurring cracks, which in turn increases the soil's 
permeability. Contaminants, including volatile organic chemicals such as 
gasoline and industrial solvents, can then be extracted more easily and cheaply 
than with current methods. The pneumatic fracturing technology has been 
licensed to Accutech Remedial Services of Keyport, N.J., a unit of Accutech 
Environmental Services. 
</P>
<P>
 Battelle has used bioventing -- pumping oxygen into contaminated soil -- to 
clean up several U.S. Air Force bases in Europe. Bioventing works because it 
supplies oxygen to enhance the natural activity of microorganisms in 
biodegradation. 
</P>
<P>
 Improving Robotic Dexterity: If you want to imagine what it's like to be an 
assembly-line robot, try this: Pick up a matchbook with just your forefinger 
and thumb, then try to put it back on the desk with the reverse side facing up 
-- without using another finger to help turn it over. While robots are tireless 
and don't take coffee breaks, they have a similar problem with manual 
dexterity. That means that unless the parts coming down the assembly line are 
aligned just so, the robot has a hard time grasping them correctly. Creating a 
parts feeder to get a properly positioned part into a robot's grasp can take 
weeks, even months.  
</P>
<P>
 Now computer scientist Kenneth Goldberg and his students at the USC School of 
Engineering's Institute for Robotics and Intelligent Systems -- along with 
Silicon Valley robotics firms Adept Technology and Silma Inc. -- think they 
have found a way to let the robot use reasoning ability instead of a dedicated 
mechanical feeder. First the robot has to be programmed to recognize from a 
video image all the possible positions a part can assume on the conveyor belt. 
Motion sequences are worked out so the robot can reorient the part. A video 
camera eye looks at each part as it moves along the conveyor belt and that 
image is rapidly analyzed by the robot so its gripper can pick up the part and 
orient it properly. So far, the prototype can feed a part every five seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 Home Video Worth Watching: A new communications tool, similar to a 
next-generation system tested by the Army for soldiers in the field, is 
available for vacationers who worry "Did I turn off the coffee pot?" The Video 
Teleport system, developed by Norcross, Ga.-based Iterated Systems, connects a 
closed-circuit television camera to a telephone line. Using a personal computer 
equipped with a modem and software developed by Iterated, remote viewers can 
dial up and see what the television camera sees. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of Iterated's patented digital compression scheme, the moving images 
can be squeezed enough to fit through a regular telephone line while retaining 
fairly realistic motion in a quarter of the computer screen. Iterated says the 
system -- which carries a suggested list price of $2,995 for the transmitter 
unit and another $495 for the receiver software -- will be particularly 
attractive to remotely monitor convenience stores, bank teller stations and 
teller machine sites that already have closed-circuit TV systems. 
</P>
<P>
 Now You Hear It: Video games may be anathema to the older generation, but the 
same technology that produces those bleeps and blasts is being used to help 
people with impaired hearing. QSound Labs based in Calgary, Canada, has formed 
a joint venture with the House Ear Institute of Los Angeles to develop a better 
hearing aid. 
</P>
<P>
 QSound technology uses digital signal processors and proprietary mathematical 
algorithms to make it seem as if sound coming from a speaker or headphone is 
actually coming from a number of places. This technology has been used 
primarily in video games, records and some films. 
</P>
<P>
 But QSound can also be adapted to let the hearing-impaired "localize" sound 
and listen selectively in noisy situations. The joint venture has licensed the 
hearing aid technology to Starkey Laboratories Inc., which expects to market 
such products next year. KATHLEEN WIEGNER

COMPUTER FILE / RICHARD O'REILLY: THE CUTTING EDGE: COMPUTING / TECHNOLOGY / 
INNOVATION; THE PICTURE WITH QUICKTAKE 100 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD O'REILLY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Apple Computer Inc. now makes a color camera to go along with its Macintosh 
computers. 
</P>
<P>
 Although electronic cameras that record color images as digital files rather 
than on film have been around for several years from makers such as Canon and 
Nikon, they haven't made a dent in the sales of regular cameras. 
</P>
<P>
 Apple's move makes sense, however, considering the preeminent position 
Macintosh holds in desktop publishing and the need for photos in such 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
 As a first effort, Apple's QuickTake 100 digital camera ($749) has a nice look 
and feel, and it is easy to operate. But it leaves you wanting much better 
image quality or a much lower price -- or both, of course. 
</P>
<P>
 (Logitech Inc. makes gray-scale FotoMan ($550) and FotoMan Plus ($799) cameras 
that work with either Macintosh or IBM-compatibles. I have not tested either.) 
</P>
<P>
 Photography has always been a complex undertaking, and when you attempt to 
digitize it, the complexity greatly increases. 
</P>
<P>
 As a camera, the QuickTake 100 is on a par with simple low-priced fixed-focus 
cameras with built-in flash and automatic exposure. Basically, you point it, 
make sure the image is contained within borders visible in the viewfinder, then 
press the shutter button. 
</P>
<P>
 There are few controls. You can choose among three flash modes -- automatic, 
always on, or off. You can choose whether to take low-resolution pictures (32 
maximum) or higher-resolution pictures (eight maximum), and you can mix the two 
resolutions within the limits of the camera's digital memory. When the memory 
is full, you must either upload the images to a Macintosh with the cable and 
software included with the camera, or erase them in the camera and start over. 
(Software and a cable to use the QuickTake 100 with Microsoft Windows on an 
IBM-compatible computer are also available.) 
</P>
<P>
 The camera has a plastic lens with fixed focus of from four feet to infinity, 
and a field of view equivalent to a 35mm camera with a 50mm lens, the most 
common lens on 35mm cameras. It can't focus close enough for portraits. You 
can't control depth of field or exposure, so you are limited to basic 
snapshots. 
</P>
<P>
 The QuickTake 100 is a color camera with 24-bit color, which means it can 
capture 16 million colors, a full range of the spectrum. But its big limitation 
is that it divides its images into relatively few digitized pixels. In low 
resolution, the picture is 320 pixels wide by 240 pixels high. In high 
resolution, it is 640 pixels by 480 pixels. 
</P>
<P>
 You may be aware that 640 by 480 is the number of screen pixels displayed on a 
standard VGA color monitor. That means that the high-resolution pictures will 
look pretty good on your computer screen -- even magnified to double their 
normal 4.4 inches by 3.3 inches -- but not that they'll look so good in print. 
</P>
<P>
 At their highest resolution at normal size, there are only 144 dots per inch 
of data. Contrast that with most color scanners these days, which are able to 
provide up to 600 dots per inch. Even a low-end 300-dot-per-inch color scanner 
captures more than four times as much data from a photographic print.  
</P>
<P>
 You can buy those for about the same price as the QuickTake 100, and sometimes 
for less. 
</P>
<P>
 With a scanner, you can get images from nearly any source into your computer, 
as well as text that can be converted into computer text files with optical 
character recognition (OCR) software. 
</P>
<P>
 But the QuickTake 100 has the advantage of simplicity and speed. You can take 
pictures and immediately transfer them to the computer.  
</P>
<P>
 In fact, you can even take pictures with the camera connected to the computer 
and store them on your hard disk faster. 
</P>
<P>
 The software that comes with the QuickTake 100 is not adequate. Although it 
can resize and rotate images, it offers no control over either brightness or 
contrast, both of which are desperately needed to get the most out of the 
limited data contained in these photos.  
</P>
<P>
 The software normally displays pictures on the screen at 200% normal size, but 
the default printing size is 100%. If you don't make sure the print 
magnification matches the screen magnification, you'll wait a long, long time 
for your print. 
</P>
<P>
 In short, you need good image-manipulation software to use the QuickTake 100 
successfully, so add that cost when you're figuring out how much you'll be 
paying. And if you're trying to decide whether to buy the camera or a scanner, 
keep in mind that scanners usually come with such software. 
</P>
<P>
 So what is the camera good for? Ironically, it's pretty good for printing 
black-and-white photos, even though they'll be taken as color images. The 144 
dots per inch make for decent black-and-white halftone images on an Apple 
LaserWriter, even enlarged. 
</P>
<P>
 But if you expect to print color pictures in your publications, figure on 
reducing the size of high-resolution QuickTake 100 images to about 3 inches by 
2 inches to get acceptable quality. And forget about taking low-resolution 
pictures with the camera. This means you'll run out of storage after eight 
pictures. 
</P>
<P>
 If you want to take the QuickTake 100 on the road with you, better plan on 
also taking a PowerBook with large disk capacity. That's one more argument for 
a regular camera, film and a scanner.

THE CUTTING EDGE: COMPUTING / TECHNOLOGY / INNOVATION; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTIES; 
CRITICS TAKE AIM AT 'SUBMARINE PATENT' AMENDMENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL KARON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In warfare, submarines can pick off enemy ships with torpedoes that can seem 
to come from nowhere. In the intellectual property arena, "submarine patents" 
can have the same effect on technology industries -- at least according to a 
chorus of critics. 
</P>
<P>
 Submarine patents are those that are kept pending for years. The applicants 
watch the related industry's development and then attempt to amend the original 
applications to cover technology that may not have existed at the time of the 
filing. Because U.S. law allows such changes while a patent application is 
pending, an opening for exploitation exists, at least in the view of the 
critics. 
</P>
<P>
 Submarine patents are typically granted long after their original filing 
dates. The term for protection of "utility" patents is 17 years, but a good 
patent lawyer can extend that for several more -- even decades -- by amending 
the original application before the patent is approved. Only then would the 
17-year clock start ticking. 
</P>
<P>
 "That way, they can claim patents on technology that wasn't claimed -- or even 
developed -- when the original patent was filed," said Breton A. Bocchieri, a 
partner with the Century City law firm Poms, Smith, Lande & Rose, which 
specializes in intellectual property issues.  
</P>
<P>
 In one case, a Missouri patent lawyer sued the entire U.S. hard-disk-drive 
industry over the rights to a type of carbon coating used on magnetic disks. 
The original patent application was for a different kind of coating, according 
to Bocchieri, who represented one of the disk drive companies, but it had been 
amended years later to include the carbon coating technology. In settling the 
case after a victory at the trial level, the defendant disk drive firms 
acquired the patents and left them open for public use. 
</P>
<P>
 Patents, always a strong form of legal protection for inventors and owners of 
intellectual property, have recently become more formidable. More and more 
disputes about patent infringement are going to trial, often commanding hefty 
monetary awards in their adjudication. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, the cost of defending against a patent lawsuit can run to millions 
of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem lies in distinguishing between "pioneer" patents -- on the 
inventions of visionaries who come up with great ideas that an industry later 
adopts -- and submarine patents, which can actually retard innovation. 
</P>
<P>
 The dangers of submarine patents have prompted action by Bruce A. Lehman, head 
of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. He proposes to put a 20-year limit on 
the application process and better educate patent office examiners in 
high-technology fields such as computers and semiconductors.

RELATIONSHIPS: MINING THE GAP; FRIENDS CONSIDERABLY YOUNGER OR OLDER HAVE MUCH 
TO OFFER, O.C. COUNSELORS AND OTHERS AGREE

<P>
 When Pati Gosnell needs fashion advice, she turns to her good friend and 
employee Alicia Bugg. The women help each other out and share many common 
interests. What they don't share is similar ages. 
</P>
<P>
 Gosnell, 50, is more than twice Bugg's age and could biologically be her 
mother. Yet their relationship has few similarities to a mother-daughter union. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're on equal footing as far as our friendship," says Bugg, 24, a floral 
designer at Gosnell's Orange flower shop, Regal Flowers. "Age doesn't really 
factor in. We both give each other advice and ideas on a variety of subjects, 
like any friends would." 
</P>
<P>
 Gosnell agrees. "I would describe our relationship as a true friendship. We 
both have the same values and often have inspiring conversations. We've also 
learned a great deal from one another." 
</P>
<P>
 This has been Gosnell's first friendship with someone younger than she, and 
she's found the experience enlightening. 
</P>
<P>
 "To be quite honest, the last person I expected to learn from was someone half 
my age. Alicia has a lot of insight and maturity for a young person. She is an 
open, friendly person who can adapt herself to any age group." 
</P>
<P>
 Flexibility and openness are two major attributes of individuals who have 
friends considerably younger or older than themselves, says Laguna Hills 
marriage, family, child counselor Vivian Clecak. "Such people aren't caught up 
in stereotypes and how things appear on the outside," she says. "They have 
varied lifestyles and don't live in an age ghetto where all they meet are 
people of the same age and life stage." 
</P>
<P>
 Having friends of varying ages gives people a richer life perspective, says 
Clecak, who has one friend 25 years younger and another 25 years older than 
herself. "Most of us live with a fairly narrow perception of the world," she 
says. "Having an older friend is insightful. It gives you a model and makes the 
road ahead a little easier. Younger friends are also inspiring in that they 
allow you to recapture and maintain your sense of youthfulness. They also give 
you the nostalgic pleasure of reclaiming the roads you've already traveled." 
</P>
<P>
 On the minus side, because of the age difference, there is a certain level of 
vulnerability involved with such friendships, says Clecak. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you have an older friend, you risk losing him or her to death, and 
younger friends' lives sometimes change. They may move away or shift their 
priorities," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the downside, there are many people who find large age-difference 
friendships fulfilling. "No matter what people look like on the outside, they 
can still share the same feelings and interests and appreciate life's 
commonalities," says Clecak. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Ever since he can remember, Roger Angle, 55, has had friends of many different 
ages, but it has never been intentional. "I choose my friends because of who 
they are, not how old they are," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Angle attributes the age differences of his friends to his constant search for 
interesting people. "I live a pretty isolated life," says the unmarried Angle, 
who lives in Costa Mesa. "I'm always curious about people who have lives very 
different from my own. In some ways I think I enjoy living vicariously through 
my friends." 
</P>
<P>
 One of Angle's good friends is Nathan Rynn, 70, a professor of physics at UC 
Irvine. He and Angle met through a salon, took a liking to one another and 
struck up a friendship over the last year and a half. Every week they meet at a 
restaurant for lunch. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Rynn and Angle are at very different points in life -- Rynn is 
considering retirement and Angle has recently changed careers from a marketing 
consultant to a full-time crime/suspense novelist -- the two men always have a 
lot to talk about. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nat is a scientist who researches things that I couldn't possibly begin to 
comprehend, but there are similarities in our careers," says Angle. "My writing 
and his research are creative outlets that require a lot of solitary time and 
discovery. He's very much in favor of research for the sake of knowledge, and I 
really respect his integrity. He also keeps himself in very good physical 
shape; I hope to be in such great shape when I'm his age." 
</P>
<P>
 Rynn agrees that he and Angle have a lot in common. 
</P>
<P>
 "Although we lead very different lives, Roger and I have a compatible view of 
life," says Rynn. "We have roughly similar ideas about things such as politics 
and social issues, which are the sort of things that make up the fiber of a 
friendship." 
</P>
<P>
 Rynn says that he never had a younger friend before Angle. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought I was a really open guy, but this has opened me up even more to all 
kinds of people and different ways of life," he says. "I have made another 
younger friend since meeting Roger, and I don't think that before I would have 
been open to the relationship." 
</P>
<P>
 At times Rynn finds himself giving Angle advice on various matters. "I've 
already been through some of the things that Roger is experiencing, and I'm 
always glad to give him any help I can," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Angle says that he benefits from Rynn's advice, as well as his example. "By 
having an older friend, I get to see my future, which can be scary at times 
because of the health problems that come with age. But it's encouraging to talk 
to Nat about how you keep physically fit as you age." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When Bugg started at Gosnell's flower shop, she was just 18 and needed some 
training to reach her potential. "Alicia needed pushing at times to do her 
best, but she always took my advice and has blossomed into a great designer," 
says Gosnell. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, Bugg has become Gosnell's right hand in the shop. She takes 
over when her boss is out of the shop. 
</P>
<P>
 "Alicia has always been a very honest, reliable person whom I can count on," 
says Gosnell. 
</P>
<P>
 While Gosnell has taught Bugg about floral designing and how to run a 
business, she says she's also learned from Bugg, including how to keep cool 
under times of stress and how to dress. 
</P>
<P>
 "Alicia always keeps cool when things get hectic here and calms me down when I 
get stressed," says Gosnell. "She also taught me a skill that is surprising 
coming from someone so young -- patience." 
</P>
<P>
 The younger woman is also more in tune with fashion and has helped Gosnell 
update her wardrobe from polyester pants to mini-skirts. "By giving me 
constructive comments, instead of criticism, Alicia has helped me improve my 
image," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, Gosnell has a lot to offer Bugg, thanks to her life 
experiences. "Alicia and I talk about many things -- from budgeting her money 
to the importance of honesty in a close relationship," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Bugg takes Gosnell's advice seriously. "I can go to Pati for advice and know 
what she tells me is accurate, because she's already been through some of the 
things I'm experiencing," she says. "Pati can really relate to what I'm going 
through." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite their age differences, both women feel like they would have been 
friends even if they didn't work together. 
</P>
<P>
 "We laugh a lot and really bring out the best in each other," says Gosnell. 
"Our age difference makes things even more special, because I feel that knowing 
Alicia gives me a richer life perspective."

FIRST PERSON: RECLAIMING ME, MYSELF AND I 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNELL GEORGE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The phrase finding oneself is a patchouli-scented keepsake. 
</P>
<P>
 The more '90s reinventing oneself is still a shade whimsical but somewhat less 
open-ended. 
</P>
<P>
 But how many of us, if placed face to face with the unexpected task of 
reshaping or reclaiming identity, can gracefully rise to the task? 
</P>
<P>
 This isn't some empty philosophical question to be pondered over a muddy 
demitasse of espresso. One's existence is more precarious than most might 
think. 
</P>
<P>
 For some reason, I've had a lot of practice in this region. One dark morning, 
propelled by my pre-New Year's Eve "new me" mission, I pulled on the requisite 
leggings and sweat shirt, collected my Walkman and cassettes spilling with 
spirited anthems, then groped for my sunglasses, keys and my wal . . . wallet: 
"My wallet!?" 
</P>
<P>
 Even though big-city living has relieved me of my wallet at least four times 
in the last seven years, the unceremonious act of suddenly misplacing my 
identity isn't quite what boosters of the most radical version of reinvention 
have in mind. 
</P>
<P>
 Now fully awake, heart thumping, yet committed not to panic, I fly down to the 
car to check the nasty nooks and crannies. Instead I pull out a long-lost 
essential Thomas Brothers page worked free from the spirals, a favorite 
fountain pen (now melted into a shiny black lump), a waxy french fry and spare 
change. (I even pocket the oxidized pennies -- it'll be a while before my ATM 
card privileges are restored.) 
</P>
<P>
 All my efforts are for naught -- my lovely vegan-friendly, green-leatheresque 
wallet is nowhere to be found. 
</P>
<P>
 Has it fallen out of my suitcase of a purse? Into the gutter? Under my bed? 
Was I pickpocketed? 
</P>
<P>
 I call last night's dinner companion, who (fortunately) dedicates her silent, 
early hours to crafting verse. She remembers me paying my share of the bill, 
but not my tucking the billfold back into its proper place. The rest comes to 
her slowly, vividly . . . a crowd of people sitting close behind me, my purse 
carelessly draped on the back of the chair. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 I call the restaurant, a ridiculously trendy trattoria I often haunt after 
work because it serves late dinners and offers a lively clientele. Even though 
it's only 7:30 a.m., I hope to catch the morning cleaning crew. But the voice 
on the other end answers my frantic questions in Spanish -- until it tires of 
my inability to make myself clear, my needs known. Then suddenly with an 
efficient click, the party on the other side disengages the line. 
</P>
<P>
 I rouse yet another friend, who in his sleep mutters magic words: una cartera 
verde. Feeling victorious I make the call again, but this time no one responds. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm already beginning to shrink out of view.  
</P>
<P>
 I know how the rest of the day will go. As well as the day to follow, and the 
days after that, as I try to navigate the city without a name -- or at least 
some concrete way to prove it. Already I'm imagining the endless maze to 
reclaiming myself: lines long, patience short, faces grim. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Making this journey provides the perfect arena for pondering what it might 
have been like when on your word, or family name, you could tool around without 
a hitch. People took you at face.  
</P>
<P>
 Nowadays, the plastic cards with raised letters and numbers and laminated 
pieces of paper with stamp-sized photographs are powerful tools that proclaim 
and/or verify existence. When all of that is stripped away, you realize how 
precarious it is to be. How much stock we put in an identity forged in plastic. 
And how quickly it can be lost. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a gamble, quite ill-advised although tempting. Do you call and cancel 
everything immediately (as most credit-card companies advise)? A frightening 
thought to watch your safety net rolled away, exposing a chasm of uncertainty. 
Or do you wait? Perchance some kind, selfless soul will return your hard-won 
credit history in tact. 
</P>
<P>
 It happens: A couple years back, a man found my wallet and refused to accept a 
reward. He saw so little cash stashed inside that he figured, "Now here's a 
woman who needs her stuff back." 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than cast your lot with the "kindness" of strangers, it's best to pick 
up the phone and a tall, cool drink and prepare to settle in for the long haul. 
For a time I kept a tidy list of credit-card account and phone numbers in an 
accordion file. But during some rare ambitious spring-cleaning episode, they 
were misplaced -- no doubt forever lost. 
</P>
<P>
 Then I simply started saving the paper wrapped around the brand-new charge 
cards, the numbers conveniently printed out on the page. Those too more than 
likely went out with the trash. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoping to make the process easier the next time around (since there would be a 
next time for sure), I signed up for one of those credit-card services 
promising that one call will stop them all. But after paying the annual fee for 
a few years, when I finally needed to use them -- adding insult to injury -- 
they had no record of me. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The piece of ID often restored most rapidly are bank cards. Some companies 
will Federal Express them if you're really in a tight spot -- on some exotic 
island, marooned in an airport. These patient phone representatives (many of 
whom could easily moonlight in crisis intervention) coolly counsel you in the 
early stages of your madness, suggesting that those cards should be the first 
thing you cancel along with your ATM card. 
</P>
<P>
 What they don't tell you is that you should request two ATM cards -- one for 
checking and one for savings -- and keep them separate. If you lose one, at 
least there's a way to withdraw some cash to float you. 
</P>
<P>
 The driver's license routine is a bit trickier. The DMV charges you $12 to 
reclaim yourself, so figure out how to scare up the funds before you arrive. 
</P>
<P>
 Banks are a ring of hell of their own. Mine (as do many) requires that you 
return to the home branch (no matter how far you have moved away from it, no 
matter how far you have to drive without a license to get to it). 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Amid the storm of the crisis, however, there is something liberating about 
wandering freely without an identity. I've known people who have likened it to 
having a lost weekend. Some feel heady with the rush of being able to cancel 
cards completely, retake a driver's license photo that has elicited snide 
comments from store clerks and barkeeps. 
</P>
<P>
 For others it is reminiscent of those dreams of wandering around some 
inappropriate public place without a stitch of clothing. One feels exposed, 
barer-than-naked, without the "documents" to prove your place on the planet. It 
forces one to realize how much we rely on these pieces of paper and plastic to 
state what should be obvious. 
</P>
<P>
 This bare-bones, scrubbed-free vulnerability in some ways resurrects something 
long-lost and essential: fusing connections and reinventing the concept of 
trust. A trust established simply by peering into someone's eyes. Drowning in 
bar codes, magnetic strips, thumb prints and "proper" picture IDs, "identity" 
has become something far removed from the person. 
</P>
<P>
 When people ask for ID, they seldom study the face, the cast of one's eyes, 
the slope of a chin. It's whether or not your signature matches, or your birth 
date makes you legal, or "Is this your current address?" 
</P>
<P>
 Yet blooming within that vast loss, one gains something infinitely more 
substantial -- rekindling the human connection, the strength and clarity to 
firmly state one's identity -- the power to be. 
</P>
<P>
 Amid the storm of the crisis, however, there is something liberating about 
wandering freely without an identity. I've known people who have likened it to 
having a lost weekend.

AN X TO GRIND; NO, THEY ALL DON'T WATCH 'MELROSE PLACE' AND WHINE ABOUT THEIR

 Lydia Ramos, 24, sips mango tea while she chats about her active life -- one 
with no time for slacking. 
</P>
<P>
 She works full time at USC as a high school recruiter. On Sundays she teaches 
at an East Los Angeles church. In the evenings she researches her idea for a 
consulting business. While driving around town, she soaks in audio books, not 
Pearl Jam. 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, Ramos -- surrounded by other twentysomethings one recent evening at 
Downtown's trendy Cafe Troy -- is not your aimless and angry Generation X 
clone. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, she has read Douglas Coupland's novel "Generation X" (St. Martin's Press, 
1991), in which he coined the term to describe 46 million Americans between 18 
and 29 as generally blase and bitter over problems -- AIDS, the national debt, 
pollution, a jobless economy and the meaninglessness of marriage -- created or 
made worse by their predecessors, some 72 million baby boomers. 
</P>
<P>
 But when it comes to talkin' 'bout her generation, Ramos is no whiner. 
</P>
<P>
 She just doesn't relate to the McMarketing moniker that has lumped her with a 
pouting bunch depicted as over-educated, under-motivated elitists hooked on 
"Melrose Place." 
</P>
<P>
 And she has plenty of post-boomer company ready to wage a war against the tag 
and its implications, which they agree do not entirely represent their 
generation. 
</P>
<P>
 Many already consider the term "Generation X" passe, but they must battle 
other downbeat labels: Slackers, Numb and Dumb, the Doofus Generation, the Lost 
Generation, the Motorbooty Generation, the New Petulants, the Posties, Baby 
Busters, Baby Bummers, Twentynothings and Thirteeners -- because they are 
supposedly the 13th generation to come of age in America. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, they have an X to grind -- and the backlash has begun: 
</P>
<P>
 * The term "Generation X" is a turn-off to most who would qualify as members, 
according to a recent MTV poll. 
</P>
<P>
 * Twenty Twenty Insight, a newsletter that provides marketing reports on 
people in their 20s, advises businesses to "lose the X unless, of course, 
you're referring to Malcolm, Madame, Racer or the Planet" and to treat these 
millions of consumers as individuals. 
</P>
<P>
 * According to the "Bellwether Generation," a national study conducted by 
Saatchi & Saatchi Advertising, "cynical, aimless twentysomethings are not at 
all the dominating segment of this group." 
</P>
<P>
 * In Washington, two social-activist groups -- Lead or Leave, started in 1992, 
and Third Millennium, formed a year later -- have set out to give their 
generation a better image through political activism and community-based 
projects. 
</P>
<P>
 * And books such as "The Twentysomething American Dream," (Dutton, 1993); 
"13th Gen" (Vintage, 1993), and the upcoming "Generation Ecch!" (Fireside, 
1994) also focus on the flip side of the movement by countering some of the 
stereotypes about the generation. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Lee Cohen, a 28-year-old Dallas lawyer and author of "The 
Twentysomething American Dream," said he's had it with the zings. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago -- after reading articles and watching TV programs that clumped 
him and his friends in the same Gen X lot as the audience that worships Beavis 
and Butt-head -- Cohen set out to see for himself "if my generation was really 
that bad." 
</P>
<P>
 With a Harvard fellowship after graduating from Harvard Law School, he trekked 
across 51 cities and interviewed 161 twentysomethings of various racial and 
economic backgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of us are striving to carve out a life for ourselves in the face of 
scary obstacles," he said about the experience. "We're apolitical but not 
apathetic." 
</P>
<P>
 He says the people he interviewed rejected greed. 
</P>
<P>
 "They just want material comfort, if not prosperity. They don't want to be 
homeless or hungry." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Sure, he said, he heard from "wary, distrustful and worried" twentysomethings, 
cynical about organized politics, religion and institutions. But the cynicism 
he encountered "seems to be partly an unexpressed idealism. We seem to be 
waiting -- not only for a hero, but for a mission." 
</P>
<P>
 For now, his mission is to help set the record straight. He said in the last 
several years the media, marketers, sociologists and pundits have bashed and 
disparaged his generation -- and the jig is up. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have been over-generalized as oversexed and overdosed with overstated 
lives," he said, adding that efforts to define today's young adults "have 
excluded the majority of the nation's twentysomething generation," including 
76% of the generation who never attended or completed college. 
</P>
<P>
 "And what about the people who weren't born into affluent families?" he asked. 
"They are a part of the twentysomething generation" that has virtually been 
ignored. 
</P>
<P>
 Cohen said most of his generation's bashing "comes from the age-old tradition 
of older generations viewing the generations coming up behind them as the worst 
horde of ingrates since the vandals sacked Rome." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Camille Mosley, 23, of Los Angeles, said baby boomers have "made statements to 
set up Generation X for failure." 
</P>
<P>
 "They don't give us a lot of credit for the ideas and the creativity that we 
have. We are very bright and capable, and we have been prejudged unfairly," she 
said, even though she doesn't entirely feel a part of the movement. 
</P>
<P>
 "Being African American -- and because of my culture -- it's a little bit 
different for me," she said. "I think that there's pressure on me -- either put 
on myself or from cultural consciousness -- to do just as well or better than 
what my parents did so that my children can do just as much for their children. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now that I am on my own, I am realizing the things that I need to take care 
of. I need health and car insurance, stuff that my parents always took care of. 
Some of us haven't really had to struggle and suffer, and I think that's why 
people really think that we're the Lost Generation and that we're just out of 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 "But, I do have a sense of responsibility as an African American woman, not as 
a Gen Xer." 
</P>
<P>
 Andrew Barrett, 24, also of Los Angeles, said: "Everyone is typecasting us as 
white rich kids raised on the Brady Bunch. I'm white but I'm not rich. I worked 
my way through college." 
</P>
<P>
 Barrett, a registered nurse, said he disagrees with the common wisdom about 
his generation: grunge-attired gripers who hang out in coffeehouses complaining 
about being overqualified for jobs and out of work. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's not my reality. I don't even like coffee," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Vi D. To, a 22-year-old Loyola Marymount senior from Los Angeles, says his 
identity is with the immigrant generation, not Gen X. 
</P>
<P>
 Born in Vietnam to Chinese parents, he was 8 when his family immigrated to the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am very different from the mainstream Gen Xer," To said. "I come from a 
history of struggle. My parents sacrificed and risked their very lives to bring 
us over here for better opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel that it is part of my responsibility to my parents to be successful 
and to live up to the American dream, to find my own identity and contribute to 
a better society." 
</P>
<P>
 He said that as a member of the under-30 generation, it's up to him and others 
to seek challenges, not run away from them. 
</P>
<P>
 "But when my generation is faced with those challenges, the media portrays us 
as losers turning to raves, drinking and doing drugs," he said, adding that's 
simply not true of all members of his generation. 
</P>
<P>
 "The generation I'm reading about seems like a group of upper-middle class 
people coming out of college without real drive and motivation, without a real 
experience of need." 
</P>
<P>
 To said he long ago "moved away from the materialistic, money-hungry ideology" 
and is into his culture and community. He counsels minority students and is the 
director of Special Games, a competitive sports event for physically and 
mentally disabled people. 
</P>
<P>
 He's not held back by a sense of futurelessness; he hopes to work as a public 
administrator, focusing on race relation programs. 
</P>
<P>
 He does, however, cringe at the term "Gen X," which he says should be 
replaced. 
</P>
<P>
 His suggestion? 
</P>
<P>
 " Generation Next , because it will be up to my generation to tackle the 
problems the boomers have left us with. We're at the beginning of a time filled 
with change and confusion," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sure, there are those who are disenchanted and disgruntled. I don't doubt 
that. But that's not the whole picture. We are a diverse generation, but 
somewhere in the Gen X movement, those diverse voices have been ignored. 
Finally, there are a lot of us who are saying, 'Hey, we gotta wake up.' " 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Helping to sound that wake-up call is Ruben Navarette Jr., a 27-year-old 1990 
Harvard graduate and co-host of a new, nightly talk radio program on KMPC 
(710-AM), directed at listeners in their 20s. 
</P>
<P>
 Navarette -- along with his co-host, Tavis Smiley, a 29-year-old African 
American -- say they are flooded with calls from articulate listeners who are 
media-literate and do not wish to follow the norm. 
</P>
<P>
 "After the third night on the air we stopped using the Gen X term because our 
listeners didn't want it," Navarette said, adding that he and Smiley soon 
christened their show with the catch-phrase, "A New Generation Talks Back." 
</P>
<P>
 The author of "A Darker Shade of Crimson: Odyssey of a Harvard Chicano" 
(Bantam, 1993), Navarette said Latino voices and those of other ethnic minority 
twentysomethings have been lost in the sound bites of a generation "that is 
still pretty much from the white male perspective." 
</P>
<P>
 For that reason and others -- especially whenever he's put-down as a slacker 
-- "I fight back with everything I've got."  
</P>
<P>
 Granted, Navarette said he's known for being non-deferential and "in your 
face." But if he wasn't, he said, he'd be accused of "having nothing, as a 
twentysomething, to offer to society." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll take a risk because I'm from a generation that doesn't believe in 
pampering. We are the first generation where women took pills not to have us. 
We were latchkey kids. We grew up hard and we grew up fast." 
</P>
<P>
 And now, Navarette said, his struggling, ambitious generation has "this huge 
rap against us that we are dumb, dangerous, disappointing -- the three Ds -- 
when in fact our generation is more well-educated than any previous 
generation." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Henry Rincon, a 25-year-old UCLA graduate and Bank of America accountant, said 
if he must align himself with a generational handle, he'd rather go with 
Generation Mex. 
</P>
<P>
 "My identity is with my family and my culture," said Rincon, who lives on his 
own in East Los Angeles, buys his own groceries and pays his own bills, none of 
which include credit card debts. 
</P>
<P>
 He praises his parents -- married for almost 44 years -- for "giving me good 
family values, especially in respecting the work ethic." 
</P>
<P>
 "My parents didn't raise me to be a bum," added Rincon, who is a mentor to 
middle-school students in East Los Angeles and one day hopes to enter politics 
"to help my barrio progress." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's up to us who don't fit the Generation X mold to break it, to trash the 
stereotype," Rincon said. "I don't watch Beavis and Butt-head. I don't live at 
home. And I expect to have a better life than my parents because they struggled 
so that I would." 
</P>
<P>
 Added Lydia Ramos: "I've heard that our generation doesn't know what it wants, 
but we want it right away. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "I know we're an antsy generation. But what generation wasn't? What generation 
didn't get a bad rap? There will never be a word that can truly capture all 40 
million of us because we are everything."

'90S FAMILY; LESSONS IN REALITY; PARENTING: HOW SHOULD KIDS LEARN THAT LIFE CAN 
BE UNFAIR? THAT SOME PEOPLE DON'T HAVE FOOD OR A HOME? IF HANDLED POORLY, SUCH 
ISSUES CAN LEAVE KIDS OVERWHELMED.

 The 4-year-old girl asked her father a simple question. Why was the man in 
front of the supermarket asking for money? Little did she know that the answer 
would be so far from simple, shocking to a child who always had a comfortable 
bed, good food and warm clothes. 
</P>
<P>
 No home? But where will he sleep? No food? But what will he eat? Suddenly and 
for the first but not the last time in her life, she learned one of the world's 
universal lessons: Life is not always fair. "She just welled up with tears 
right there," said her father, Rob Conaway, of Norwalk. 
</P>
<P>
 She talked about the man throughout the shopping trip, so Conaway gave him $5 
as they left, more than he usually would hand out but the amount seemed to 
comfort his daughter. For a moment, anyway. Back in the car, he found himself 
gently explaining why they couldn't invite the man home. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you're explaining it, you're not really sure you understand it 
yourself," he said. "It's difficult to not convey the suspicion that goes with 
it sometimes." 
</P>
<P>
 It's a balancing act many parents struggle to perform every day as their 
children glimpse the world's woes. The young bombing victims who stare out from 
the covers of newsmagazines stacked next to candy and gum. The homeless parents 
standing with children at the street corner. The evening news that brings the 
story of a 10-year-old's suicide. 
</P>
<P>
 "The challenge is to find a middle ground," said Adrienne Kaplan of Long 
Beach, whose daughters are 5 and 8. "It can be overdone. I think they need to 
start at a small level, but to make them crazy about it is absurd. It's our 
problem." 
</P>
<P>
 That middle ground is the healthy place for children and adults to be, said 
Daun Martin, psychologist and president of the California Psychological Assn. 
The Greeks called it the "Golden Mean." In other words, moderation. Swing too 
far on the compassion pendulum and children become overwhelmed and learn 
hopelessness and anxiety. Swing back the other way and they become desensitized 
-- hostile, even -- to the weak. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the extremely desensitized are the gang members, "who might, just might, 
cross the street to help their own mother," Martin said. But to a lesser degree 
parents can desensitize their children when they tsk-tsk their way through the 
news and then flip over to a situation comedy without comment or discussion. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the major things we forget today is that we resolve our fears and 
tension and anxieties about things by helping, by doing something . . . and 
talking about the world," Martin said. 
</P>
<P>
 But how do parents plant the seeds of compassion without drowning children in 
despair? Follow a child's lead, said Janine Olson, a head teacher at Pacific 
Oaks College and Children's School in Pasadena. Even at Pacific Oaks, where the 
founders' Quaker principles of fairness and nonviolence permeate the 
curriculum, children are not given more than they can handle, Olson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the biggest mistakes we as adults make is talking too much. That has a 
tendency to make the questions stop because it's not fun," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The other mistake is misinterpreting the question. Ask a question or two in 
return to find out just what and how much a child wants to know, Olson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Then keep the answer simple and let it sink in. During recent walks in a 
nearby park, many Pacific Oaks children asked why men there were cooking food 
at barbecues. For some children, the answer "they don't have kitchens" was 
enough. Those who wanted to understand more asked more. 
</P>
<P>
 There are no exact age guidelines to follow when it comes to dispensing these 
life lessons. From about age 3 1/2 to 4, children begin to ask such questions 
because they believe everyone lives as they do and are befuddled when their 
perception gets dinged by reality, Olson said. 
</P>
<P>
 By about second grade, most children have a basic understanding of the more 
complex issues surrounding social ills. And the discussions become all the more 
important, often presenting opportunities to talk about the family's values or 
religious answers. Kaplan discovered that when her 8-year-old heard a radio 
broadcast about promiscuous men in a foreign country who had contracted the 
AIDS virus. 
</P>
<P>
 "Does that mean those men can have sex whenever they want?" her daughter asked 
from the back seat of the car. 
</P>
<P>
 They had a good talk, and "I definitely put a moral judgment on it," Kaplan 
said. "It was a good opportunity. But I didn't think I'd be talking about that 
yet. I'm sorry it had to come out of that newscast." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 More and more, Kaplan turns the radio off now when her daughters pop into the 
car. But no one can wear blinders. When Stacy Kredel of Irvine took her three 
children on a train trip from Orange County to Los Angeles, the short ride 
opened their eyes wide to homeless communities otherwise unseen from most 
streets and freeways. 
</P>
<P>
 "My youngest just didn't understand why we can't just even it all out so 
everyone has a house," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the experience gave them a better understanding of why their father helps 
out at a soup kitchen. Kredel said she wants her children to have a slightly 
bigger world view than she had growing up on Balboa Island in the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe there wasn't much of 'It,' but if there was any at all, it was never 
talked about," she said. "We want to expose them to some of the realities (so 
they will) learn to think for themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 Conaway, on the other hand, laments that too much reality has already soaked 
up too much of his daughter's childhood innocence. His daughter still delivers 
him an occasional bundle of outgrown clothes and toys for the homeless -- 
without prompting. 
</P>
<P>
 But he can't help but notice that when they turn onto the freeway every day to 
pick up her younger brother from day care, she almost never comments anymore on 
the ever-present homeless people.

'90S FAMILY; HOW KIDS CAN GIVE OF THEMSELVES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 People haven't yet found a way to end suffering, but at least they've had 
enough time to practice the age-old medicine that can help stave off 
overwhelming despair: taking helpful action. The world's religions espouse it 
and modern psychology explains it. 
</P>
<P>
 "The concept of being able to have some control over your environment somehow 
takes away the anxiety, or distresses, of bad things happening," says Daun 
Martin, psychologist and president of the California Psychological Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents may need to guide them, but children can find their own ways of 
giving, says Janine Olson, a head teacher at Pacific Oaks College and 
Children's School. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then they are fulfilled, rather than fulfilling our value system," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Here are a couple of directions child-size efforts can take: 
</P>
<P>
 * The traditional food and clothing drives are good. At Pacific Oaks, the 
older children went further and planned a bake sale to benefit the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
 * Heifer Project International turns relatively small contributions into big 
yields by providing food-producing livestock to developing nations. For 
example, $20 sponsors a flock of chickens. 
</P>
<P>
 Brochures listing the animal gamut, from honeybees to milk cows, are available 
by writing to Heifer Project International, Route 2, Perryville, Ark. 72126. 
</P>

the Social Problems You Choose and Turn Creative Thinking Into Positive Action"

 The outstretched hand of Jesus is taking shape as Maurice Jenkins, perched on 
a scaffold 11 feet high, brushes in the tones of Jesus' open palm in acrylic 
and oil the color of coconut shell. 
</P>
<P>
 This mural of a black Jesus Christ dominates the foyer of the mammoth new 
Ebenezer African Methodist Episcopal Church, still under construction in Fort 
Washington, Md., outside Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 When Jenkins finishes here, he will begin work on several more requests from 
ministers eager to have black-Christ paintings and murals in their churches -- 
more requests than ever before. 
</P>
<P>
 Black-Christ images are appearing in stained-glass windows, statues, murals 
and paintings in churches from New Jersey to California. But the trend signals 
a change much deeper than the color of Jesus' skin. 
</P>
<P>
 "We look at this as a major movement," Jenkins said. "The slave trade took 
away our culture and our religion, and now this is a natural progression for 
the black church to revitalize the African traditions that were taken away." 
</P>
<P>
 Afrocentrism, a movement that already has made its mark on campus and 
curriculum, is beginning to transform the modern African American church. 
</P>
<P>
 Many black churches remain untouched by the movement, and in many it has met 
resistance. Nevertheless, the Afrocentric approach -- which puts Africa at the 
heart of history and culture, shunning the Western bias toward Europe as the 
cradle of civilization -- is being adopted by individual churches of many 
denominations in a variety of ways. 
</P>
<P>
 Entire congregations turn out for church dressed in African finery on "African 
Awareness Sundays." Even at regular Sunday services, Ghanaian kente-cloth 
outfits are replacing Easter-style frocks and somber suits. 
</P>
<P>
 Preachers stress the place of blacks in the Bible, drawing from more than a 
dozen recent books published on the subject. 
</P>
<P>
 The Original African Heritage Study Bible, a King James version with 
photographic re-enactments of Bible scenes using black models, has sold about 
half of the 300,000 copies in print. 
</P>
<P>
 Drummers and guitarists spice up musical offerings, accompanying and sometimes 
even replacing the church organist. Choirs, wearing robes trimmed with kente 
cloth, sing rousing gospels in previously staid Catholic and Pentecostal 
services. 
</P>
<P>
 The impact of these changes is still being felt, but one is already clear: 
Some African Americans who dismissed Christianity years ago as a "white man's 
religion" are now returning to church, said more than a dozen ministers among 
those interviewed. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's interesting to me the number of brothers coming in from the Nation of 
Islam," said the Rev. Donald Hilliard of Second Baptist Church Cathedral in 
Perth Amboy, N.J. "These are people who were born in the Christian faith, then 
became alienated from the church because they saw it as irrelevant. . . . I 
baptized seven in the last year. They're coming in weekly." 
</P>
<P>
 Hilliard's church reopened two years ago in a renovated downtown theater that 
last showed pornographic movies. Directly over the baptistery is a 
larger-than-life stained-glass window of a resurrected black Christ wearing a 
purple robe etched in kente, broken chains lying at his feet. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The concept central to all the Afrocentric changes in churches is the shift 
away from thinking of Jesus as white. It has long been tradition in churches 
throughout the world for images of Jesus to mirror the faces of the faithful. 
</P>
<P>
 Jesus is often depicted in Latin America as Latino, in Asia as Asian, and in 
Africa as black. U.S. churches of the African Methodist Episcopal denomination 
have accepted black-Christ images for 100 years, since Bishop Henry McNeal 
Turner first uttered the words "God is a Negro." 
</P>
<P>
 The difference now is that Afrocentric scholars are fast popularizing research 
that they say proves that the "Jesus of history" was a man of color, an 
"Afro-Asiatic Jew." Ministers who say they would have been uncomfortable having 
black-Christ images in their churches even five years ago now do so, saying 
such depictions are "historically accurate." 
</P>
<P>
 Howard University's Divinity School has become one of the centers of 
Afrocentric scholarship, home to professors such as Cain Hope Felder and Kelly 
Brown Douglas, author of the new book "The Black Christ." 
</P>
<P>
 Felder, author of the ground-breaking book "Troubling Biblical Waters: Race, 
Class and Family," has spoken at dozens of church workshops and seminars since 
the publication last year of the African Heritage Bible, for which he edited 
the essays seeded throughout on the presence of Africans in biblical times. 
</P>
<P>
 Felder says Jesus of Nazareth was an Afro-Asiatic Jew who "probably looked 
like a typical Yemenite, Trinidadian or African American of today." Felder 
finds evidence for this in biblical passages such those in Matthew, where the 
"angel of the Lord" commands Joseph to take Mary and Jesus to hide in Egypt. 
</P>
<P>
 "Imagine the divine family as Europeans hiding in Africa!" Felder writes in 
the Bible's introduction. "This is quite doubtful." 
</P>
<P>
 Essential to the theory of Felder and other Afrocentric scholars is their 
belief that Egypt is part of Africa and not the Middle East, a geographical 
distinction they say was concocted by scholars to avoid attributing major 
historical events to Africa. Maps in the African Heritage Bible identify the 
lands where most biblical stories are set as Northeastern Africa and Eden. 
</P>
<P>
 Prisoners from 33 states have written more than 500 letters requesting the 
African Heritage Bible from Felder's Biblical Institute for Social Change at 
Howard. Many prisoners wrote that they were former Christians or converts to 
Islam. 
</P>
<P>
 But among academics, Felder's ideas are not widely accepted or even known. 
Robert Funk, chair of the Jesus Seminar, a round table of New Testament 
scholars, said most scholars accept that Jesus, a Jew, was a Semite, "swarthy 
in complexion" but hardly black. 
</P>
<P>
 Funk had never heard the term "Afro-Asiatic Jew." He laughed and said: "That's 
just funny. . . . I suppose we'll be claiming next that he was a woman. Or that 
he was Asian. Or that he was Native American. The possibilities are unlimited." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But on one point there seems to be universal agreement: The images of Jesus 
best known to Americans, such as Warner Sallman's ubiquitous "Head of Christ" 
painting depicting Jesus with pale skin and blond locks, are more mythological 
than historical. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's a romanticized self-image that Caucasians have produced," Funk said. 
</P>
<P>
 Scholar Stephen Mitchell said: "If I were black, I would definitely be talking 
about Christ as black. . . . I am very much in sympathy with this desire to 
show that 'Jesus was one of us.' " 
</P>
<P>
 But there is no validity to the conclusion that Jesus in history was black, 
said Mitchell, author of "The Gospel According to Jesus." 
</P>
<P>
 The Gospels provide no information about the ancestry of Mary, who as the 
virgin mother of Jesus provides the only relevant genealogy. And if Jesus 
looked any different from an ordinary Jew, the accounts would have made mention 
of it, as in the references to the Ethiopian eunuch, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell cautioned: "I think it is very important to respect the truth with 
all of our hearts. Once you let your desire become more important than the 
truth, you get into real trouble. You have people in pre-Nazi Germany writing 
about Jesus as a blond-haired Gentile. It's very dangerous to take your desires 
too seriously." 
</P>
<P>
 Some churchgoers ask why it matters what color Jesus was. Kelly Brown Douglas, 
of Howard, bristles at that question. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you aren't able to see God in yourself and yourself in God, then you can't 
see yourself as a child of God," she said.  
</P>
<P>
 "What does it do to a person's self-esteem when Christ is pictured as your 
oppressor? The message is, 'You're worth nothing.' This society tells little 
black children that every day."

GENERATION X CHRONOLOGY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL QUINTANILLA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Three years ago, some 38 million Americans in their 20s were dubbed Generation 
X: a grungy, angry, hopeless group of gripers. But a backlash is emerging as 
many say that stereotype is wrong. Here's a brief history of the labeling of a 
generation. 1990 
</P>
<P>
 * In a July cover story, Time magazine christens today's young adults "the 
twentysomething generation," spawning similar articles in other publications. 
1991 
</P>
<P>
 * Douglas Coupland's novel "Generation X" is published in April. Critics call 
it a guidebook for the twentysomething set. His book's user-friendly pages 
include Gen X lingo such as "McJob" -- "A low-pay, low-prestige, low-dignity, 
low-benefit, no-future job in the service sector." 
</P>
<P>
 * The first Lollapalooza tour -- a packaging of bands popular among the 
Generation X crowd -- sells out amphitheaters across the country during the 
summer and attracts throngs to its midway of body-piercing booths. 
</P>
<P>
 * In July, the film "Slacker" is released, setting off a bandwagon effect of 
other Gen X movies. 
</P>
<P>
 * In September, Kurt Cobain and his band, Nirvana, release the album 
"Nevermind," bringing the alternative Seattle sound and grunge wear -- plaid 
flannel shirts and ripped jeans -- to the Gen X masses. Fans hail Cobain's 
anti-anthem single, "Smells Like Teen Spirit" and tag him the voice of 
antisocial slackers. Less than three years later, Cobain commits suicide. 1992 
</P>
<P>
 * "The Real World" -- an MTV docu-soap -- makes its debut in May, depicting a 
cross-section of Gen Xers living under the same roof in New York, allowing 
viewers to eavesdrop on their secrets, squabbles and sexual sparks. In 1993, 
the video verite program switches locales to Venice and moves to San Francisco 
beginning later this month. 
</P>
<P>
 * In July, "Melrose Place" -- Angst , Gen X-style -- debuts on Fox television 
to a slow start. Later, Heather Locklear arrives to goose the ratings. 1993 
</P>
<P>
 * Signs of a Gen X backlash begin to surface. Movies with a twentysomething 
sensibility -- "Bodies, Rest and Motion" (April), "Three of Hearts" (April), 
"Poetic Justice" (July), "Kalifornia" (September) and "True Romance" 
(September) -- under-perform at the box office. A year later, "Reality Bites" 
tries to sink its teeth into Gen X movie-goers. The $11 million film brings in 
less than $20 million at the box office. 
</P>
<P>
 * Twenty-six-year old Harvard graduate Michael Lee Cohen, tired of the press 
overkill that has over-generalized his generation, treks across America to 
prove that young adults are hopeful and optimistic. After interviewing almost 
200 people, he writes "The Twentysomething American Dream" (Dutton), published 
in October. It explores how his generation is shaping the world it will 
inherit. 1994 
</P>
<P>
 * Twenty Twenty Insight, a business newsletter, advises corporate America to 
shun Generation X-themed marketing. 
</P>
<P>
 * Michael Krugman, 29, and Jason Cohen, 26, (no relation to Michael Lee Cohen) 
write "Generation Ecch! The Backlash Starts Here," (Fireside), to be published 
in August. Says Cohen, a self-professed overachiever: "We worry too much about 
what the media says about our generation. Ecch is about getting a life."

CASTRUITA WILL QUIT SANTA ANA SCHOOL DISTRICT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JODI WILGOREN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rudy M. Castruita, superintendent of Orange County's largest school district 
and a national spokesman for urban schools, will leave his job in August to 
take over the top post at the San Diego County Department of Education. 
</P>
<P>
 In his six years running Santa Ana Unified, Castruita, 50, has earned an 
armful of accolades for slashing the district's dropout rate, raising test 
scores and bringing together city, business and school leaders to fight gangs 
and drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 The 43 schools of the Santa Ana District -- ninth largest in California -- 
serve a student body that is 95% minority, with 81% of the elementary school 
children qualifying for free or reduced-price lunches. More than two-thirds of 
the students have limited English skills. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's tough leaving Santa Ana. I love it. But I'm going to something, I'm not 
leaving anything," Castruita said in an interview Tuesday after announcing his 
plans at a San Diego news conference. "The greatest accomplishment in Santa Ana 
was getting people to believe that all kids can learn . . . hopefully, with 
this new opportunity, I'll be able to do some of the same things on a broader 
basis." 
</P>
<P>
 Castruita's salary in San Diego will be about the same as his current $124,000 
a year. He will oversee 800 employees and an $87-million annual budget, running 
programs for children of migrant workers, students with disabilities, juvenile 
delinquents and students who have been expelled from the county's 43 local 
school districts. 
</P>
<P>
 Diane Thomas, a spokeswoman for the Santa Ana district, said the school board 
would select a search firm in the next few weeks and hopes to have a new 
superintendent in place by August. 
</P>
<P>
 Political, education and community leaders from Santa Ana and across the 
county on Tuesday lauded Castruita as a crucial role model for Latino 
youngsters. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm delighted for him, but I'm disappointed for Santa Ana," said Orange 
County Supt. of Schools John F. Dean. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a sad day for all of us," added Santa Ana Trustee Robert W. Balen. 
</P>
<P>
 During Castruita's six-year tenure as superintendent, Santa Ana Unified has 
grown from 38,000 students to 49,000, opening seven new schools with three more 
under construction. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1988, Santa Ana Unified has earned two national Blue Ribbon School and 
10 California Distinguished School awards. Key Castruita initiatives include 
free breakfast, scholarship and dropout-prevention programs. He also launched 
Santa Ana 2000, a cooperative effort among the school district, the city, 
Rancho Santiago College and the Chamber of Commerce that provides job training, 
child care, health care and after-school recreational activities designed to 
keep youths away from gangs and drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's done a straight-A job of running the district," Santa Ana Mayor Daniel 
H. Young said. "He brought a lot of pride back to the district. Teachers are 
proud of the jobs they have and parents are proud of the schools. He got 
everybody motivated." 
</P>
<P>
 Balen, who was elected to the board in 1989, praised Castruita's countywide 
leadership and said, "he's really turned the (Santa Ana) district around." 
</P>
<P>
 "His energy and his intellect combined with his leadership abilities . . . 
plus his dedication to doing what's best for the students is just a win-win for 
everybody," Balen said. "It's frustrating to see a talented individual that's 
provided such leadership to our district just walk out the door." 
</P>
<P>
 Though Castruita has earned state and national recognition for his work, 
criticism from within his district has mounted in recent months. Rosemarie 
Avila and Tom Chaffee, two school board members who are aligned with 
conservative Christian groups that oppose school reform, have often attacked 
Castruita as the five-member board argued. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Santa Ana needs a breath of fresh air," Chaffee said Tuesday. "I 
can't say I'm sorry to see him go." 
</P>
<P>
 Though Castruita denied that recent board squabbles entered into his decision, 
members of the school board's majority said they suspect that Avila and Chaffee 
helped push him from the district. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you get two elected board members constantly criticizing you, when you 
come to serve and you give your all and this is what you get back in your face, 
it makes everybody question a lot of why we're here," Trustee Audrey 
Yamagata-Noji said. "This is a hard community to serve in. We can't keep good 
people. I feel helpless." 
</P>
<P>
 Born in El Monte, Castruita went to Utah State University on an athletic 
scholarship, then returned to his hometown to teach high school. He earned a 
doctorate from USC and worked in the Los Alamitos Unified School District 
before coming to Santa Ana as assistant superintendent in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
 He is a dynamic speaker who visited classes nearly every day and prided 
himself on knowing students' and employees' names. 
</P>
<P>
 "He came out of the barrio, so he could speak the language," County Supt. Dean 
said of Castruita, who began kindergarten with limited English himself. "He 
talked to kids in their own language and said, 'Stay in school.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Castruita was named Orange County's Man of the Year in 1988, and two years 
later he was profiled in Orange County Metropolitan magazine as someone whose 
career would "leave an imprint on life in the community." The Assn. of 
California Administrators gave him its highest honor, the Marcus Foster Award, 
in 1991, then named him Superintendent of the Year in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 For the last two years, Castruita has presided over the Assn. of California 
School Districts. He met with former President George Bush and 20 Latino 
leaders several years ago, and recently sat on a panel at Gov. Pete Wilson's 
crime summit. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a real blow to lose Rudy Castruita, but we've been fortunate to have him 
for as long as we have," said Sal Mendoza, president of the Santa Ana school 
board. 
</P>
<P>
 Other Latino leaders echoed Mendoza's statement. 
</P>
<P>
 "What a tremendous loss. Our kids, our parents, our community is going to feel 
a terrible, terrible loss," said Alfredo Amezcuam, past president of the 
Hispanic Bar Assn. of Orange County. "He's certainly been a model, he's been an 
innovator, he's been one that we have looked up to. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like losing one of your best friends." 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the superintendent of the Orange County Department of Education, who is 
elected, the San Diego County superintendent is appointed by the county's 
five-member Board of Education. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Hampton, president of the board that selected Castruita from among 40 
applicants, called him a "visionary leader." 
</P>
<P>
 "We really believe he's got a very deep commitment to all children," Hampton 
said Tuesday. "From his own personal experience and from the kinds of things 
he's been able to do in Santa Ana, we believe he really understands deeply the 
importance of public schools."

MUHAMMAD CASE SUSPECT HAS A RECORD OF VIOLENCE; SHOOTING: JAMES E. BESS WAS 
ACQUITTED IN THE SLAYING OF HIS BROTHER. HE WAS CONVICTED OF MANSLAUGHTER IN 
MISSOURI. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 When James E. Bess was arrested in the attempted slaying of a Nation of Islam 
leader in Riverside, those who had known him in recent years found the outburst 
of violence out of character. 
</P>
<P>
 But his past as a young Muslim was marked by serious clashes that resulted in 
arrests, convictions and the death of his brother. 
</P>
<P>
 In the mid-1960s, Bess was convicted of manslaughter in Missouri and of 
assault in Fresno, according to newspaper accounts at the time. A decade later, 
he fatally shot his brother during a family argument at his Fresno home, but a 
jury found that he had acted in self defense. 
</P>
<P>
 "Violence has a way of following him around," said John Nelum, head of the 
National Assn. for the Advancement of Colored People in Fresno, who has known 
Bess for more than 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Bess, 49, a former Nation of Islam minister who was expelled a few years ago, 
now stands accused of trying to kill Khallid Abdul Muhammad, whom Nation of 
Islam leader Louis Farrakhan suspended last year after his verbal assault on 
Jews, Arabs and whites prompted national leaders to denounce him. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators said Tuesday that they are trying to determine whether Bess was 
stalking Muhammad before the Muslim leader and five bodyguards were wounded 
Sunday night at a UC Riverside auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources said Bess was seen outside a Los Angeles theater the previous night 
while Muhammad was speaking inside. 
</P>
<P>
 Several Nation of Islam members knew the shooting suspect and recognized him 
as he sat in his parked car at the Vision Theater in Leimert Park, then walked 
back and forth outside, said various sources, who spoke on condition of 
anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
 One source, a high-ranking official of the Nation of Islam, said Bess never 
entered the theater, but became conspicuous for hanging around outside while 
Muhammad spoke inside. 
</P>
<P>
 Police investigators said they were trying on their own to reconstruct Bess' 
movements in the hours and days before Muhammad was shot in Riverside. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside Bess' vehicle, which was parked near the auditorium, police found a 
scope-equipped, high-powered rifle and ammunition. Outside the building, police 
found a backpack containing two additional semiautomatic handguns similar to 
the one they say was used in the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 Muhammad, diverting from security plans, stepped outdoors after his two-hour 
campus presentation to continue to answer questions. 
</P>
<P>
 Bess allegedly got to within 10 feet of him and opened fire, striking Muhammad 
and five of his bodyguards. Muhammad, who underwent surgery Tuesday for removal 
of a bullet in his foot, remains hospitalized, along with another man. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said Tuesday they had no clues to Bess' motives. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not dealing with a whodunit," said UC Riverside Police Chief Hank 
Rosenfeld. "We know whodunit. What we're dealing with is why." 
</P>
<P>
 Without notice, Bess was quietly arraigned Tuesday afternoon before Riverside 
Municipal Court Judge Gary Tranbarger. He was charged with one count of 
attempted premeditated murder, with the use of a gun and inflicting great 
bodily injury. Bess also was charged with five counts of assault with a firearm 
with infliction of great bodily injury. The most serious charge carries a 
possible life prison term. 
</P>
<P>
 Answering the judge's inquiries in a soft voice, Bess pleaded not guilty to 
the six counts and was assigned a public defender, according to the Riverside 
County district attorney's office. His preliminary hearing was scheduled for 
June 14. 
</P>
<P>
 Bess was being held without bail and under police guard. He remains in 
Riverside General Hospital for treatment of a broken shoulder, broken teeth and 
other injuries he suffered in a beating during the melee after the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 Muhammad remained in a secured room at Riverside Community Hospital, protected 
by members of the Nation of Islam's contingent of security guards known as the 
Fruit of Islam. 
</P>
<P>
 A number of ranking Nation of Islam officials visited him during the day, 
including Wazir Muhammad, West Coast bureau chief of the Final Call, the 
religion's newspaper. He said that Farrakhan was expected to issue a statement 
soon. 
</P>
<P>
 Bess joined the Nation of Islam in the mid-1960s, one of the first and most 
committed members in the Fresno area. 
</P>
<P>
 Nelum, the NAACP chief, recalled that Bess was bright and personable but had a 
violent streak. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wouldn't say James has a history of being crazy," he said. "But he's 
definitely a strange fellow. You don't push James. He's bound to explode." 
</P>
<P>
 In March, 1966, the Fresno Bee reported that Bess, then 21, and his 
19-year-old brother were sentenced to prison terms in the beating and kicking 
of a 41-year-old Fresno man who refused to buy the newspaper Muhammad Speaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Bess admitted that he kicked the man when he was down and had "lost control of 
himself," the Bee reported. 
</P>
<P>
 During the trial, the prosecutor revealed that the Bess brothers also were 
convicted in 1964 of manslaughter and sentenced to 10 years in prison but 
paroled the same day, in Caruthersville, Mo. 
</P>
<P>
 After the assault conviction, state medical authorities said James Bess 
represented "a considerable potential menace to the community." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1975, the Bee reported, Bess, then 30, shot his older brother, Elvin, in 
the right eye, killing him. When police arrived, Bess handed over a .22-caliber 
rifle and said, "You can have the rifle. I shot him." 
</P>
<P>
 Bess told police he believed his brother had a gun in the package he carried, 
according to a newspaper account at the time, but the package contained a 
frying pan found near the victim's body. The jury acquitted Bess, finding that 
he fired in self defense. 
</P>
<P>
 After the trial, Bess moved to Washington, where he continued to be active in 
the Nation of Islam. Nelum said that he saw Bess only two months ago in Fresno 
when Farrakhan spoke. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a nice long chat," said Nelum. "And he seemed to be in good spirits." 
</P>
<P>
 People familiar with Bess' years in Washington characterized him as a 
generally loyal follower of Farrakhan, despite having been removed as minister 
of a Seattle mosque about four years ago, and later ousted altogether from the 
Nation of Islam. 
</P>
<P>
 One source said Bess lost his ranking because he ran an "unproductive" mosque, 
where attendance had slipped to an all-time low and which was making no money. 
</P>
<P>
 An associate of Bess replaced him as the mosque minister but the situation did 
not improve and Nation of Islam officials came to believe that the two were 
acting in concert to drive away members, the source said. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Bess and his replacement, sources said, were removed as ministers by 
Wazir Muhammad, who at the time was the West Coast director for the Nation of 
Islam. 
</P>
<P>
 Wazir Muhammad had accompanied Khallid Muhammad at both of his Southern 
California appearances, but apparently was not targeted by the gunman. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though Bess might have borne a grudge against Wazir Muhammad, a Nation of 
Islam official said there was little doubt in his mind that Khallid Muhammad 
was Bess' target. "It's definite he was trying to shoot Khallid," the source 
said. "If he had wanted to shoot (Wazir Muhammad), he could have, because all 
the security was with Khallid." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite his ouster from the black separatist organization, Bess continued to 
teach in Farrakhan's name, without authorization, a Nation of Islam source 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even as a preacher on community access television in Seattle, Bess continued 
to espouse conventional teachings of the Nation of Islam, which was founded in 
Detroit in the 1930s. 
</P>
<P>
 "James tried not to make the split a major issue and continued to be a strong 
advocate of Farrakhan and Farrakhan's programs," said Charlie James, a Seattle 
community activist who said he has known Bess for about 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Absolutely nothing in his character, personality or background indicated he'd 
do this," James said. "Most people say if he did (the shooting), he simply 
flipped out." 
</P>
<P>
 While Bess enjoyed the personal support of a small group of people, "he had a 
much larger audience on cable than in (church)," James said. "Thousands of 
people were hearing him. He had a very interesting, fairly significant 
following." 
</P>
<P>
 A production assistant at the cable television public access facility, who 
asked that he not be identified, said Bess used inflammatory language "in a 
rhetorical sense. But he didn't have one of those wild shows designed to set 
people off." 
</P>
<P>
 Jolinda Stephens, a Seattle resident, said she met Bess when she worked for 
the African American newspaper, where Bess was a columnist, and found him 
engaging. Even though she is white, Bess invited her to attend his church, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said his church was open to all races. . . . He said he had talked to 
people in the Nation of Islam about moving past the 'white devil' concept," 
Stephens said. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite Bess' television exposure, leading figures in Seattle's African 
American community said Bess was not regarded as a political or civic leader. 
He was not known, for instance, by the directors of the Seattle Human Rights 
Commission or the Minority Executive Directors' Coalition, two of the most 
important such groups in the city.

CHICAGO-STYLE FIGHT INSTINCT DRIVES 'ROSTY' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM J. EATON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In many respects, Rep. Dan Rostenkowski never left Chicago and its political 
folkways, despite spending nearly 36 years in Congress and achieving a lasting 
national legacy for his role in helping to overhaul U.S. income tax laws in 
1986. 
</P>
<P>
 A towering bear of a man who could intimidate his colleagues, Rostenkowski's 
brusque style reflected the blunt, take-no-prisoners politics practiced in his 
hometown. 
</P>
<P>
 "You might as well kick a guy's brains out if he's not for you," the 
Democratic congressman once said in a typical bit of Chicago street talk. 
</P>
<P>
 So the aggressive "Rosty" was doing what comes naturally when he decided to go 
to the mat with federal prosecutors rather than holler "uncle" and accept a 
plea bargain. 
</P>
<P>
 Rostenkowski, who dominated the House Ways and Means Committee as its chairman 
for more than a decade, earned top marks as a legislative achiever. Driven by a 
passion for political power, the 66-year-old lawmaker hoped to climax his 
career by playing a leading part in passage of health care legislation that 
would add to his reputation for accomplishments against the odds. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, his dream has soured as he has spent much of this year trying to 
retain some measure of dignity in a Washington world where he has never seemed 
fully at home. 
</P>
<P>
 As Ways and Means chairman, he was one of the most powerful men in government, 
shaping policy on taxes, Social Security, Medicare, welfare and trade. 
</P>
<P>
 Probably his proudest accomplishment was passage of the 1986 tax law, which 
reduced the top income tax rate to 28% and eliminated many tax preferences for 
business. As part of that campaign for tax fairness, he appeared on television, 
urging viewers to "write Rosty" if they favored the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 On the downside, Rostenkowski's reputation suffered because of his unashamed 
appetite for perquisites, including steak dinners at lobbyists' expense and 
invitations to free golfing trips at some of the nation's top resorts. 
</P>
<P>
 "In my hometown of Chicago they call politics a blood sport," he once said. "I 
don't apologize for getting in the arena and I'll be damned if I apologize for 
winning." 
</P>
<P>
 He was also true to his roots on another issue. In a motto coined by Chicago 
ward boss Paddy Bauler more than a half-century ago and handed down through the 
political generations: "Chicago ain't ready for reform." Neither was 
Rostenkowski. 
</P>
<P>
 While other lawmakers pretended that they did not want a pay increase, 
Rostenkowski came out for a system whereby a House member could, within limits, 
set his or her own salary. Naturally, Rostenkowski said that he deserved the 
highest rate of pay because of his committee chairmanship as well as his 
ability to deliver benefits for his constituents. 
</P>
<P>
 Rostenkowski bristled at Congress' increasing requirements for financial 
disclosure, limits on members' speaking fees and proposals to curb free meals 
and golfing trips financed by lobbyists. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chicago congressman had few peers when it came to taking free trips to 
make speeches before special interest groups at locations conveniently close to 
a golf course. 
</P>
<P>
 During the five years ending in 1991, for example, the veteran politician took 
167 trips at the expense of corporations, universities and charities -- an 
average of 34 expense-paid trips a year. His reelection campaign once paid 
$1,600 in "consulting fees" to five golf professionals who attended 
fund-raising events with Rostenkowski on the golf links. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1992 election cycle, Rostenkowski charged his campaign treasury for 
$28,422 worth of meals at restaurants and country clubs, mostly in the Chicago 
area. At the same time, he was a leader on the paid lecture circuit, collecting 
more than $1 million in speaking fees in a two-year period, keeping the maximum 
amount allowed under House rules, about $50,000, and donating the rest to 
charity. 
</P>
<P>
 Growing up in the Great Depression in what now would be called a disadvantaged 
neighborhood, he learned directly about free-and-easy machine politics as the 
son of a Chicago alderman and ward boss who presided over a Polish-American 
fiefdom on the city's northwest side. 
</P>
<P>
 With his father's clout, it was easy for Rostenkowski to become the youngest 
member of the Illinois Legislature at the age of 24, the youngest Illinois 
state senator at 26 and a member of the U.S. House of Representatives at 30. 
Chicago's Democratic Party selected nominees who breezed to election in the 
one-party town, assuring a safe House seat for Rostenkowski for decades. 
</P>
<P>
 Although in recent years the machine has began to sputter, Rostenkowski -- 
whose possible indictment was the subject of wide speculation in the press -- 
got help when he desperately needed it from ward organizations in last March's 
primary election. They assisted him unquestioningly and overwhelmingly and he 
won renomination to another term. 
</P>
<P>
 When he first went to Congress in 1958, Rostenkowski and his wife, LaVerne, 
tried living in Washington but she missed Chicago and moved back to their old 
neighborhood, a stone's throw from the Kennedy Expressway that knifes through 
the city's northwest side. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, Rostenkowski became a member of the "Tuesday-Thursday club," 
commuting from Washington to Chicago and spending long weekends at home unless 
the House was considering legislation on Mondays or Fridays. 
</P>
<P>
 On Capitol Hill, he focused at first on the internal politics of the House, 
gradually building friendships that might help him later, keeping Chicago's 
needs ever in mind. He became known as "Mayor Daley's man in Washington," 
although other Democrats in the city delegation had more seniority. 
</P>
<P>
 He brought home the bacon to his city and state with such regularity that even 
Republican Gov. Jim Edgar endorsed Rosty's reelection this year when he was in 
the toughest race of his political life. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1965, Rostenkowski was rewarded with a seat on Ways and Means, then under 
the forceful leadership of Rep. Wilbur D. Mills (D-Ark.). For a decade, until 
Mills departed after a scandalous encounter with an exotic dancer from 
Argentina, Rostenkowski acquired seniority and familiarity with the arcane tax 
code. 
</P>
<P>
 He chafed during the tenure of Rep. Al Ullman (D-Ore.), a knowledgeable but 
ineffectual leader, and took over the committee's helm in 1981, passing up a 
chance to take the third-ranking House leadership post as majority whip. 
</P>
<P>
 With newly elected Republican Ronald Reagan in the White House, the rookie 
chairman made what he later conceded was a serious mistake, engaging in a 
"bidding war" to see who could cut taxes the most. Reagan won, the federal 
government's revenue base was seriously reduced and Rostenkowski learned a 
political lesson the hard way as the House voted with Reagan by a large 
majority. 
</P>
<P>
 Working with Reagan and the Republicans, Rostenkowski helped to preserve the 
solvency of the Social Security system by making tough choices to raise payroll 
taxes to assure that retirement benefits would be paid to baby boomers in the 
next century. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result of his strong hand, Rostenkowski brokered the complex deals behind 
the major tax bills of the 1980s and '90s. But he experienced some embarrassing 
defeats as well. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, for example, six Democrats on Ways and Means joined with all the 
Republicans to push through a cut in capital gains taxes that Rostenkowski 
fought, both in his committee and on the House floor. Only hard-nosed tactics 
by Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.) blocked it from becoming 
law. 
</P>
<P>
 Even worse, legislation that Rostenkowski championed to provide catastrophic 
health insurance coverage for senior citizens, along with a surtax on them to 
pay for it, produced such a strong backlash that the law was repealed. 
</P>
<P>
 As Rostenkowski increased his power on the committee, he began to run the 
panel like a Chicago ward boss, disbursing benefits and demanding loyalty in 
return. Under his system, committee Democrats caucused frequently to develop a 
consensus, pledging that each of them would support the resulting compromise. 
Rosty took names of defectors, placing them in his own version of political 
purgatory. 
</P>
<P>
 At times, Rostenkowski's reputation as a domineering chairman was fostered by 
committee members who could tell advocates for special interest groups that 
they had tried to persuade the chairman to support a legislative provision but 
got only a scowl in return. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was the designated bad cop on occasion," said one aide, contending that 
Rostenkowski's image as a rough and gruff taskmaster distorted his efforts to 
build a consensus without bullying tactics. 
</P>
<P>
 As one expert on Congress, Norman Ornstein of the American Enterprise 
Institute, described his legacy: "To be sure, at times he has been too 
partisan, at times too gruff or crude, at times too much of a dealer or 
logroller. But he has stood out as a leader of men, women and policy 
development in this country -- stood out in a way that few members do at any 
time." Profile: Dan Rostenkowski

</P>
<P>
 Tuesday's indictment dates back to a 1991 investigation of irregularities in 
the House post office by then-U.S. Atty. Jay B. Stephens of the District of 
Columbia. Stephens obtained office expense records from Rep. Dan Rostenkowski 
and two other members of Congress to determine if persons there had used 
expense accounts to obtain cash fraudulently from the postal unit. This series 
of events then developed: 
</P>
<P>
 * February, 1992 -- Four former employees of the House post office are charged 
in federal court with embezzlement. All plead guilty. 
</P>
<P>
 * March, 1992 -- Robert V. Rota resigns as House postmaster. 
</P>
<P>
 * May, 1992 -- At Stephens' request, a federal grand jury subpoenas six years 
of office expense records from Rostenkowski and Rep. Austin J. Murphy (D-Pa.) 
and former Rep. Joe Kolter (D-Pa.), who was voted out of office. 
</P>
<P>
 * September, 1992 -- The grand jury charges that there was a broad conspiracy 
between House post office employees and others to defraud the government. The 
indictment names only one defendant -- Joanna G. O'Rourke, former chief of 
staff of the postal unit -- but says she conspired with others. O'Rourke pleads 
guilty to two misdemeanor counts of embezzling government property and misusing 
funds. 
</P>
<P>
 * October, 1992 -- Rostenkowski begins using political campaign donations to 
cover expenses of defense lawyers representing him in the grand jury probe. 
</P>
<P>
 * December, 1992 -- Records of Rostenkowski's office are revealed showing 
unusually large transactions in postage stamps running into tens of thousands 
of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 * January, 1993 -- Rostenkowski's bank records are subpoenaed in a sign that 
the federal grand jury investigation is widening. 
</P>
<P>
 * March, 1993 -- Stephens, a holdover from the Bush Administration, says his 
investigation of Rostenkowski's affairs has nothing to do with partisan 
politics. 
</P>
<P>
 * July, 1993 -- Rota, the former House postmaster, pleads guilty to 
embezzlement charges for helping members of Congress trade postage vouchers and 
stamps for thousands of dollars in cash. He had initially denied to 
investigators that such exchanges took place, but his admission indicates he 
has damaging allegations against Rostenkowski in particular. Rostenkowski 
claims Rota's charges are "baseless" and says he is retaining Robert S. 
Bennett, one of Washington's top defense lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
 * October, 1993 -- Eric H. Holder Jr., named by the Clinton Administration to 
succeed Stephens, decides to present the Rostenkowski case to a new grand jury 
so that investigation can be expanded. 
</P>
<P>
 * January, 1994 -- On advice of his lawyer, Rostenkowski repays the government 
$82,000 charged to his official House account for what he describes as personal 
items and gifts. 
</P>
<P>
 * March, 1994 -- Rostenkowski wins the Democratic congressional primary in his 
Chicago district. 
</P>
<P>
 * May, 1994 -- Holder presents an outline of the case against Rostenkowski to 
his Justice Department superiors. Rostenkowski decides against pleading guilty 
to any offenses and says he will contest all charges in court.

DEFENSE SELDOM RESTS ON ISSUES OF ETHICS AND DUTY; LAW: ATTORNEYS WALK FINE 
LINE IN COACHING CRIMINAL DEFENDANTS. SOME CASES WEIGH HEAVILY ON THE 
CONSCIENCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Criminal defense attorney Cristina Arguedas was representing a black man 
charged with raping a white woman. The police had picked him up as a registered 
sex offender -- he previously served prison time for three rapes -- and the 
victim tentatively identified him in a lineup. 
</P>
<P>
 During the trial, Arguedas attacked the victim's identification of her client 
as not only weak but racist. She won an acquittal. 
</P>
<P>
 Four months later, she picked up her telephone and heard a public defender say 
that the man had just been arrested again for rape. 
</P>
<P>
 "I went through this whole reflective, guilty thing that I had used my skills 
to injure another woman," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the ultimate criminal defense attorney's nightmare. Obligated to defend 
with zeal, these lawyers nevertheless confront personal dilemmas in their 
relationships with their clients, caught between duty to the accused and 
revulsion for their violent crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 Like all lawyers, they also wrestle with ethical boundaries in the lengths 
they can go to defend and coach their clients. They can shape the story their 
clients will tell at trial, but they are not supposed to fabricate a script. 
</P>
<P>
 For Arguedas, the nightmare proved short-lived. After a week of torment, the 
public defender called her back. Her former client had been in a bank at the 
time of the rape and could not possibly have done it. 
</P>
<P>
 "So then I was a hero," said Arguedas, who has been a criminal defense lawyer 
for 15 years. "It was at that time I realized that this isn't for me to figure 
out. The system requires that someone like him have an absolutely vigorous 
defense." 
</P>
<P>
 Although defense attorneys are often reviled by a crime-weary public, they are 
viewed as being among the more ethical members of the legal profession because 
prosecutors and, in some cases, the public, scrutinize their every move. They 
usually get paid whether they win or not. 
</P>
<P>
 "The criminal defense bar is far more honorable to deal with than the civil 
bar," said Los Angeles County Deputy Dist. Atty. Marsh Goldstein, a prosecutor 
for nearly 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Considered the emergency doctors of the legal world, the nation's estimated 
15,000 to 25,000 criminal defense attorneys face realities that would have 
disappointed audiences of Perry Mason. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of their clients are guilty: About 90% of them plead so, although usually 
to reduced charges, experts say. The attorneys practice alone or in small 
firms, enjoy less status in bar associations than other lawyers, and, as a 
group, tend to distrust government and gravitate to the underdog. 
</P>
<P>
 Although a few earn fame and enormous riches, about half earn less than 
$80,000 a year and only a quarter make more than $125,000, according to a 1991 
survey by a defense lawyers association. Lawyers who defend white-collar 
criminals tend to earn the most. 
</P>
<P>
 Arguedas is one of the rising stars of the profession. Working out of a 
warehouse district near Berkeley, she dresses in casual slacks, a long-sleeved 
shirt and sensible walking boots that would be appropriate on a hiking trail. 
</P>
<P>
 Her defense of the accused rapist violated no ethics: She was obligated to 
challenge the victim's identification, even though she personally suspected 
that he probably had raped the woman. 
</P>
<P>
 The ethical land mines arise in the shaping of the defense, the intimate 
conversations between attorney and client where strategy is plotted and 
testimony is planned, where the story the defendant will tell in trial is 
pieced together. 
</P>
<P>
 These conversations are usually privileged, and the lawyer, like a priest 
hearing a confessor's sins, is obligated not to disclose them. But defense 
lawyers described a variety of techniques they use with their clients, and 
ethics experts disagreed about how far the lawyers should go in molding a 
defendant's tale. 
</P>
<P>
 Discrediting a prosecution witness the lawyer knows to be truthful is within 
ethical bounds, legal ethicists say, but helping a client perjure himself is 
far more problematic. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyers are supposed to obtain "a set of facts" from their clients, not invent 
a story for them, said Yale law professor Geoffrey Hazard. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, the lawyer should not tell a woman who killed her husband that 
she should claim she was abused by him if she was not. 
</P>
<P>
 "But the fact of the matter is, lawyers do tell their clients what to do, 
indirectly," said Hazard, who teaches legal ethics. "How artificial they are, 
how artful, varies. . . . What do you do if you have a dumb client?" 
</P>
<P>
 Before asking for the facts, some attorneys may first inform their clients of 
the legal defenses to their crime. 
</P>
<P>
 To a man charged with hit-and-run, the lawyer might say: "If you ran from the 
scene because you feared the other driver was going to kill you, you may be 
acquitted. Take a couple of days to think about why you fled before you tell me 
what happened." 
</P>
<P>
 Some ask their clients what the prosecutor will contend, not what happened, 
and give their clients a type of Miranda warning to avoid having to keep them 
off the stand. 
</P>
<P>
 Others say they want all the facts immediately and just try to put them in the 
best light. In many cases, the attorney simply tries to show that the 
government has not proved its case. 
</P>
<P>
 Ethical rules approved by state high courts tend to be ambiguous and often 
contradictory, and lawyers can interpret them differently. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanford University law professor William H. Simon, reflecting a minority view 
among legal ethicists, believes it is unethical for a defense attorney to try 
to impugn a truthful prosecution witness by arguing, for example, that the 
witness had poor eyesight. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Hazard maintains that the lawyer is duty-bound to challenge the witness 
whose eyesight might be questionable. Even if the client told the lawyer he 
committed the crime, "that does not mean the witness observed him doing it," 
Hazard reasoned. 
</P>
<P>
 Simon, whose views are stricter than most other ethicists, also believes a 
defense lawyer should not withhold pertinent information from the court -- even 
if it is damaging to the client -- or present a defense the lawyer is certain 
is untrue. 
</P>
<P>
 In a law review article last year, Simon cited the case of a Washington public 
defender whose client was charged with receiving stolen property. Police had 
arrested him as he and an accomplice transferred the stereo and television from 
a junked car to the back seat of the borrowed car the client was driving. 
</P>
<P>
 The client confided to his lawyer that he had put the property in the back 
seat because he did not have a key for the trunk. But the lawyer argued in 
court that the client obviously did not know the property was stolen because he 
did not try to conceal it in the trunk. 
</P>
<P>
 A jury convicted the defendant anyway. The lawyer, in Simon's view, had acted 
unethically. "He presented misleading information to a jury," Simon said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although lawyers can properly suggest a defense if the evidence does not 
exclude it, basing a case on a lie usually fails, many criminal defense 
attorneys say. 
</P>
<P>
 "If (clients) are going to concoct a defense because you suggested one, they 
are going to get torn to shreds on cross-examination," said Oakland lawyer 
Robert Kroll. "They are not going to be believed." 
</P>
<P>
 But lawyers must probe their clients' memories. It is perfectly proper to tell 
a client in an interview: "I am not sure you were focusing as sharply as you 
should have when you gave the answer," or "Wouldn't it be just as accurate if 
you phrased it this way?" said Hofstra University Law School professor Monroe 
Freedman. 
</P>
<P>
 As officers of the court, lawyers are not supposed to aid their clients in 
committing perjury, and criminal defense attorneys almost uniformly insist that 
they do not allow their clients to perjure themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Rules vary by state. California's bar association recommends that lawyers 
withdraw from a case if they cannot dissuade their client from lying on the 
stand. If they cannot withdraw, they should refrain from repeating the lies in 
courtroom arguments. 
</P>
<P>
 But lawyers have latitude as long as they have no actual knowledge, such as 
corroborating evidence, that the testimony is perjurious, Freedman said. 
</P>
<P>
 In any case, most lawyers do not consciously or deliberately allow their 
clients to lie on the witness stand, said Yale's Hazard. 
</P>
<P>
 "Either they talked themselves into the fact that it is not going on, that the 
person is just skirting the truth . . . or the lawyer manages to persuade 
herself that it might be the truth, or maybe it is not the truth and the lawyer 
pretends to be surprised," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 San Francisco Public Defender Jeff Brown recalled that in his first criminal 
case, the defendant changed his story in the middle of the trial after 
realizing the prosecution's witnesses were unsure of the weapon he used in an 
assault. 
</P>
<P>
 At first the client said he had a gun, later a wrench. Brown asked the judge 
to allow him to withdraw from the case once he realized his client was going to 
lie on the stand. The judge balked -- "We're in the middle of a trial" -- and 
told him to proceed. 
</P>
<P>
 The perjury worked. The jury was hung, and charges were dropped to a 
misdemeanor. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think what you have to do is say to your client, 'Look, I don't think this 
a very good idea,' and try to convince him not to lie on the stand," Brown 
said. "But as a practical matter, an awful lot of perjury goes through the 
courts, not just in the criminal bar. It's pervasive throughout the system." 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond the ethical quagmires, criminal defense attorneys say they must 
overcome their personal horror of their clients' suspected crimes to become 
effective advocates. 
</P>
<P>
 "You fight against any impulse of being repulsed by the crime itself," said 
San Diego criminal defense attorney Chuck Sevilla, the appellate lawyer for 
Robert Alton Harris, who was executed in 1992. Harris killed two boys and then 
ate their hamburgers. 
</P>
<P>
 North Carolina attorney Donald H. Beskind, who teaches trial skills at Duke 
University Law School, said people always ask how a lawyer can defend someone 
so awful "because they never have to meet the person who is charged with the 
crime."

 "They hear the crime and then they presume what the person is like," Beskind 
said. "When you . . . meet the person and understand what has gone on in their 
lives that made them that way, you have a very different reaction to them." 
</P>
<P>
 Concerned about a client repeating his crime, defense attorney Alan Dershowitz 
subjects the defendants he represents to a standard lecture. His clients have 
included Claus von Bulow and Leona Helmsley. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every dog gets one bite," the Harvard law professor tells his clients. "Don't 
dream of calling me if you ever get in trouble again. Not only will I not 
represent you, I will be on the other side." 
</P>
<P>
 When Dershowitz won the freedom many years ago of a murder defendant -- he had 
helped plant a bomb that killed a young woman -- he was unable to celebrate. 
The victim haunted him. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than suffer such quandaries, some lawyers refuse to accept clients 
whose crimes are too troubling for them. 
</P>
<P>
 Arguedas says she is unsure whether she would ever represent an accused rapist 
who claimed the victim had consented. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do a really, heavy aggressive cross-examination," she said. "I don't want 
to do that on a woman by saying, 'Didn't you really want this?' " 
</P>
<P>
 For defense lawyer Christie Warren, the test came when she defended child 
molesters while she was pregnant. As her child moved inside her, she stood in 
courtrooms and defended men accused of violating other children in ghastly 
ways. Homicide cases were easier for her. 
</P>
<P>
 "You just have a little more baggage to get beyond" in rape and child 
molestation cases, said the assistant public defender in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 Some defense lawyers cannot stand the turmoil and pressure and switch to other 
areas of the law after a while. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was tired of being treated as though I was a criminal," said Beskind, who 
abandoned his criminal practice in North Carolina several years ago. "It was 
guilt by association." 
</P>
<P>
 This guilt by association is widespread. Defense attorneys say they are often 
accosted in social settings about what they do, and, in the more extreme cases, 
receive chilling threats from the public. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyer Danny Davis had to move five times while defending Raymond Buckey, who 
was accused of molesting scores of children at the McMartin Preschool in 
Manhattan Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of Davis' homes were firebombed, and men attacked him physically in the 
parking lot of the courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
 "I learned how to roll under my car, in my suit," he said. "That is the best 
defense." 
</P>
<P>
 Buckey was acquitted of 40 counts of molestation, and a mistrial was declared 
on eight counts. 
</P>
<P>
 On a more benign level, attorney Dershowitz found himself castigated when he 
took on the appeal of heavyweight champion Mike Tyson, who was convicted of 
rape in a trial Dershowitz believed was unfair. Female students at Harvard, 
where Dershowitz teaches, protested. 
</P>
<P>
 Dershowitz contends that the female students allowed the rape itself to 
overshadow the tenet that everyone deserves a defense and a fair trial, that 
government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt an individual's guilt to 
protect the innocent from being wrongfully convicted. 
</P>
<P>
 "If even Harvard law students don't understand the role of defense attorneys," 
Dershowitz said, "we have a very, very difficult mission."

JAMAICA AGREES TO LET U.S. HOLD HAITIAN HEARINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 The Clinton Administration has won agreement from Jamaica to set up a facility 
on the Caribbean island to support shipborne immigration hearings for Haitian 
refugees fleeing their country by sea, officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement, which may be announced as early as today, will come as a major 
relief to the Administration, which has been searching for a home for the 
refugee processing operation ever since President Clinton announced his new 
hearing policy more than three weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the proposed arrangement, Haitian boat people will still be plucked from 
the Caribbean by the U.S. Coast Guard and the U.S. Navy, officials said. But 
instead of being forcibly returned to Haiti, where a military dictatorship has 
used increasingly brutal tactics of repression, the refugees will be housed on 
ships moored off Kingston, the Jamaican capital, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 Once on the ships, the refugees will be interviewed by American immigration 
officials to determine whether they meet U.S. standards as political refugees 
-- meaning a well-founded fear of individual persecution. 
</P>
<P>
 But most of the refugees will never actually step ashore in Jamaica, one 
official said. Jamaica has offered to resettle only about 100 refugees, even 
though the Coast Guard has picked up as many as 5,000 a month. "What the 
Jamaicans are offering is basically the needed onshore facilities to support 
the ships," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Unless other permanent homes are found, many of the refugees will probably 
still be returned to Haiti, he noted. 
</P>
<P>
 The ships will include both a U.S. Navy hospital ship and at least one 
Ukrainian cruise ship that the Defense Department is chartering for the 
operation, the officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The ships may be in place and the operation begun as early as next week, they 
said. The cost of the operation will be borne by the United States, the United 
Nations High Commission for Refugees and other donors, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials carried on intensive talks with both Jamaica and the 
British-ruled Turks and Caicos Islands, but settled on Jamaica because its 
facilities were better, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's special envoy for Haiti, former Rep. William H. Gray III, arrived in 
Jamaica Tuesday to go over the details of the arrangement, and Deputy Secretary 
of State Strobe Talbott was expected to arrive in Kingston today. 
</P>
<P>
 "The formal announcement may be waiting for Talbott's arrival," one senior 
official said. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton ordered the change in refugee policy May 8, under pressure from 
liberal Democrats in Congress, civil rights groups and activist Randall 
Robinson, who waged a hunger strike on the Haitians' behalf. 
</P>
<P>
 But officials were somewhat embarrassed after the fact to acknowledge that 
they did not have agreement from any Caribbean country to host the refugees or 
even the immigration hearing operation. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, both Jamaica and Turks and Caicos cautiously expressed interest.

SUPREME COURT UPHOLDS CURFEW ON DALLAS YOUTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID G. SAVAGE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Supreme Court on Tuesday gave a boost to the growing number of cities that 
enforce curfews for teen-agers when it rejected a challenge to a Dallas law 
that generally requires those under 17 to be off the streets after 11 p.m. on 
weekdays and midnight on weekends. 
</P>
<P>
 Without a dissenting vote, the high court refused to hear an appeal filed on 
behalf of three young people and their parents who said that the city law 
"convicts the innocent . . . and broadly stifles fundamental liberties." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the court did not explain its decision, in earlier rulings the 
justices have said that the First Amendment does not give teen-agers a 
"generalized right of social association" that permits them to be out after 
hours. Moreover, official discrimination based on age is permissible, the court 
has said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyers in the case said that curfews to fight juvenile crime exist in as many 
as 1,000 cities, including Santa Ana, Huntington Beach, Los Angeles, Norwalk, 
Inglewood, Santa Monica and Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 While Tuesday's action is not a binding national ruling, it strongly suggests 
that the high court will not strike down curfews as broadly unconstitutional. 
However, some lower courts have invalidated curfews that do not permit 
exceptions for teen-agers who work or are accompanied by their parents. 
</P>
<P>
 Two other decisions announced Tuesday also restrict First Amendment rights. 
</P>
<P>
 In a case that yielded four separate opinions, the high court ruled that 
public employers may fire workers whose job complaints could affect the morale 
of fellow employees. So long as the manager makes a "reasonable" effort to 
investigate what was said, the manager can then dismiss a disgruntled worker to 
ensure that the complaints do not "detract from the agency's effective 
operation," the court said. 
</P>
<P>
 The case (Waters vs. Churchill, 92-1450) sought to clarify the free speech 
rights of public employees, such as teachers, nurses, police officers and state 
workers. 
</P>
<P>
 The First Amendment severely restricts the government's power to pass laws 
infringing on free speech, but government officials can limit the free speech 
rights of their employees. 
</P>
<P>
 The court in 1968 said that a public school board could not fire a teacher for 
writing a letter to a newspaper complaining about the board's curriculum 
policies. But in a 1983 decision, the court cut back on free speech rights by 
stating that a public employee who voices internal complaints can be fired. 
</P>
<P>
 In Tuesday's decision, seven justices agreed only that the nursing supervisor 
at a public hospital could dismiss a disgruntled nurse for her on-the-job 
griping, so long as the supervisor first made a "reasonable" effort to learn 
who said what to whom. 
</P>
<P>
 In a separate First Amendment case, the justices allowed government-sponsored 
fairs, carnivals and parades to keep out groups whose message is deemed 
"inappropriate." 
</P>
<P>
 The justices refused to hear an appeal filed by anti-abortion activists who 
claimed that their free speech rights were violated when they were excluded 
from a city-sponsored festival. 
</P>
<P>
 Frankfort, Ky., stages a Great Pumpkin Festival each October to bring people 
downtown for "fun and entertainment." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990, a local anti-abortion group applied for a booth to distribute plastic 
models of fetuses, but fair sponsors deemed such political advocacy 
inappropriate. The group also denied booths to two groups who support abortion 
rights. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kentucky Supreme Court upheld the fair sponsor's authority to restrict 
participation to nonpolitical groups, and only Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
voted to hear the appeal in the case (Capital Area Right to Life vs. Downtown 
Frankfort, 93-1201). 
</P>
<P>
 In the curfew case, lawyers said that the Dallas law may have won approval in 
part because it contains so many exceptions. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dallas curfew was enacted in 1991 but in 1992 it was modified to exempt 
young people who are accompanied by a parent or guardian, are running an errand 
or are out because of an emergency. 
</P>
<P>
 The curfew also does not apply to those who are traveling for work reasons or 
attending a school, religious or civic function. Moreover, children are allowed 
on the sidewalks in front of their homes or a neighbor's home. 
</P>
<P>
 Fines of up to $500 can be assessed against youths as well as their parents 
and the owners of establishments who serve minors after hours. 
</P>
<P>
 In November, the U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans ruled that 
the Dallas law is justified by the city's "compelling interest" in reducing 
juvenile crime and in "promoting juvenile safety and well-being." It cited 
statistics showing that murders, assaults and rapes occur most often between 11 
p.m. and 1 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The case (Qutb vs. Bartlett, 93-1571) was dismissed by the high court without 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
 A number of California cities have curfew laws, but enforcement has depended 
to a great extent on local police priorities and cost considerations. Los 
Angeles, for instance, has had a longstanding 10 p.m. curfew for juveniles, but 
enforcement has been sporadic. 
</P>
<P>
 Huntington Beach's 10 p.m. curfew is 50 years old, but has been enforced only 
recently in the downtown area because of complaints about youths. 
</P>
<P>
 Huntington Beach City Atty. Gail C. Hutton welcomed the ruling. "Young people 
should not be out on the street coalescing in gangs and small groups," she 
said. "They should be occupied in some way or in bed." 
</P>
<P>
 Smaller cities have in recent years increasingly turned to curfews to combat 
street crime and reduce the number of young victims of random violence. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Jose Fernandez hailed the high court's action. "I think the Supreme 
Court has reaffirmed society's right to make sure that parents are responsible 
for their kids. At least that's the message the decision sends to me -- it says 
we can legally hold parents responsible."

to be labor intensive, enforcement has depended to a great extent on local 
police priorities and cost considerations. Los Angeles, for instance, has had a 
longstanding 10 p.m. curfew for juveniles, but enforcement has been sporadic. 
Officers have used the curfew mainly as a tool to deter gang violence in 
targeted areas of the city.

to combat street crime and reduce the number of young victims of random 
violence. Most, like the Dallas law, make exceptions for youths who are 
returning from work or running an errand with a parent's permission. 
</P>
<P>
 Norwalk's four-year-old program, officials say, averages about 20 violators a 
week, as does a similar program established three months ago in Long Beach. In 
Inglewood, where an ambitious, 2 1/2-month-old curfew has resulted in the 
arrest of 120 teen-agers since March, Councilman Jose Fernandez -- a high 
school teacher who pushed the ordinance -- hailed the high court's action.

O.C. DISASTER CHANGES PLANE-DISTANCING POLICY; AVIATION: CITING CRASH LINKED TO 
757 WAKE TURBULENCE, FAA WILL REQUIRE AIRCRAFT TO STAY 4 MILES BACK INSTEAD OF 
3. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF BRAZIL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Citing a crash that killed five people in Santa Ana last December, the Federal 
Aviation Administration has adopted a policy that will require smaller planes 
to stay farther behind Boeing 757 jetliners to prevent accidents caused by 
their potentially hazardous wake turbulence. 
</P>
<P>
 But the regulatory agency's actions -- part of a detailed set of new policies 
on 757s -- fall short of safety recommendations made by the National 
Transportation Safety Board earlier this year. And aviation-safety experts and 
pilots' advocates termed the changes merely a "first step" toward making the 
skies safer for aircraft landings and takeoffs behind 757 jetliners. 
</P>
<P>
 FAA Administrator David R. Hinson outlined the new policy in recent days in a 
letter to NTSB Chairman Carl W. Vogt. 
</P>
<P>
 Beginning July 1, the FAA will require that air-traffic controllers handling 
landings to keep aircraft four miles behind 757s -- instead of the current 
three-mile minimum -- to protect them from the miniature hurricanes produced by 
rapid air movement across the larger aircraft's wings. 
</P>
<P>
 The NTSB in February had recommended that the FAA adopt minimum separation 
distances of up to six miles behind 757s. The FAA, however, is not bound by 
NTSB recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
 At least two crashes that took a total of 13 lives and three other serious 
accidents have been linked to wake turbulence from 757s since December, 1992. 
Because it could potentially decrease the number of flights at the nation's 
airports and cut into revenues of the hard-hit airline industry, the FAA has 
been reluctant to increase separation distances between 757s and tailing 
airplanes. 
</P>
<P>
 While the NTSB does not consider the 757 to have any structural flaws, 
researchers have speculated that its unique, sleek-wing design may be the cause 
of the turbulence that can be unusually powerful for an aircraft of its size. 
</P>
<P>
 The NTSB has found that because 757s and other newer jets can slow down 
quicker than older jetliners, trailing aircraft can inadvertently close in too 
quickly and fall below the 757's descending flight path -- a danger zone where 
aircraft can encounter wake turbulence and suddenly be thrown out of control. 
</P>
<P>
 Both fatal accidents happened when smaller jets flew into 757 wake turbulence 
as they were preparing to land. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dec. 15 Santa Ana crash occurred when a twin-engine corporate jet was on a 
landing approach to John Wayne Airport. The jet, which was 2.1 miles behind a 
Boeing 757, went out of control and slammed nose-first into the ground near the 
Santa Ana Auto Mall. All five aboard, including the top two executives of the 
In-N-Out Burger chain, were killed. The NTSB is still investigating the 
accident, but turbulence from the 757 is said to have played a part. 
</P>
<P>
 The other fatal crash occurred in Billings, Mont., in 1992. Eight people were 
killed. 
</P>
<P>
 NTSB spokesman Mike Benson said the safety board will review the FAA's new 
policies and draft a formal response over the next several weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Flocke, a spokesman for the Air Line Pilots Assn., said, "We think it's a 
good beginning. It certainly addresses part of our concern. But it doesn't, for 
instance, address separation on departures." 
</P>
<P>
 The Air Line Pilots Assn., the largest pilots' organization in the world, 
recently issued its own advisory on 757s, recommending that pilots of smaller 
aircraft -- even MD-80s and DC-9s -- remain five miles or at least "two 
minutes" behind 757s on final approach, Flocke said. The organization also has 
recommended that pilots ask the control tower for extra time when taking off 
behind 757s, Flocke said, to give more time for the 757 turbulence to diminish. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite concerns from other corners of the aviation industry, the FAA said it 
believes that the four-mile separation is safe enough -- for now. 
</P>
<P>
 "The FAA believes that this interim increased separation will provide an extra 
margin of safety without unnecessarily impacting system capacity," FAA 
Administrator Hinson wrote in a May 20 letter outlining the changes to NTSB 
Chairman Vogt. 
</P>
<P>
 The four-mile separation, Hinson wrote, recently was adopted by the Civil 
Aviation Authority in Great Britain and "has significantly reduced the number 
of reported incidents" there. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of its new policies on 757s, Hinson said, the FAA is embarking on a 
two-year test with the help of the National Aeronautics and Space 
Administration to determine the precise level of danger 757 wake turbulence 
poses. The four-mile separation limit will remain in effect until testing shows 
whether additional distance is necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 After its own investigation, the NTSB last February unanimously advised the 
FAA to overhaul its 20-year-old aircraft weight classification system, which is 
used to set separation distances. 
</P>
<P>
 The FAA, however, said an overhaul was not warranted now, but that it would 
study the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Leo Garodz, a former FAA manager who was among the first to bring the 757 wake 
turbulence problem to the agency's attention in 1991, said the new policies 
represented an "initial step," but nothing more. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a beginning, but it's only a beginning, because there's going to be 
another accident, because things are not that precise at airports when there is 
a heavy traffic load," Garodz said. 
</P>
<P>
 The FAA said it also plans to require air controllers to be more cautious when 
dealing with planes behind 757s; educate pilots of 757s on the potential danger 
their aircraft poses to other planes; encourage 757 pilots to use established 
approach paths so other planes don't unwittingly fly into their wake; and 
require air controllers to complete an annual course in wake turbulence. 
</P>
<P>
 Canadian aviation officials have recently begun to require five or six miles 
of separation behind 757s, depending on the size of the trailing aircraft. 
Their counterparts in the United Kingdom require a minimum of four-, five- or 
six-mile separation, depending on aircraft size.

RIORDAN CALLS FOR MEDIATOR IN LAPD SICKOUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARC LACEY and JAMES RAINEY, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles police officers staged Day 2 of their mass sickout Tuesday, 
causing only minor disruption of public service but exasperating city officials 
and prompting Mayor Richard Riordan to call for a mediator to step in. 
</P>
<P>
 In an unusual joint appearance designed to signal the seriousness and 
solidarity of the city's leadership, Riordan appeared with seven council 
members standing behind him as he spelled out the city's budget woes. 
</P>
<P>
 "The city respects the police and wants to give them a raise and reward them 
for a job well done," Riordan said. "(But) the city is facing the gravest 
financial situation since the Great Depression." 
</P>
<P>
 The mayor called on the officers union, the Police Protective League, to 
permit an impartial mediator to settle the two-year dispute. 
</P>
<P>
 "If mediation is rejected, the council will have no other choice in my opinion 
and I believe they will vote for an impasse," Riordan said. 
</P>
<P>
 After the declaration of an impasse, the city could call in a mediator without 
the union's approval; if mediation fails, the city could impose a contract 
unilaterally. 
</P>
<P>
 Although officially unsanctioned by the officers union, the job action known 
as "Blue Flu II" enjoyed wide support from the rank and file Tuesday: Of 548 
officers scheduled to report to day watch duty, 248 -- or 45% -- called in 
sick. (Other officers were ordered to work double shifts to cover for their 
"ailing" colleagues.) 
</P>
<P>
 Union leaders denounced the mayor's suggestion that a mediator be appointed, 
condemning it as a stalling tactic that would escalate the dispute. They also 
decried the increasingly rancorous tenor of the management-labor dispute. 
</P>
<P>
 "This should be a civilized discussion," said Geoffrey Garfield, spokesman for 
the Police Protective League. "Instead, it's become a jungle -- the 
back-and-forth, the heightened tensions, the sickout. The city is banging its 
chest saying it wants to be king of the jungle and we're doing the same. 
Meanwhile, the citizens are wondering what's going on." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, most citizens are feeling the sickout's effects lightly -- if at all. 
But some apparently are being spared traffic citations. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly a third of the 34 officers assigned to the Valley Traffic Division 
failed to report for the day shift. 
</P>
<P>
 "We probably have fewer traffic enforcement officers out there so we might not 
be able to write as many tickets as we usually would," said Lt. Joe Rezzo. "But 
we're in real good shape as far as coverage to the community is concerned, and 
we are well-prepared to respond to any emergencies." 
</P>
<P>
 At Foothill Division's detective bureau in Pacoima, investigations of some 
crime reports -- especially those involving misdemeanors -- were being delayed 
at least a day, said the station's chief of detectives, Lt. Gary Halden. Fewer 
than half the detectives and other inspectors employed there arrived for work 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be a tremendous impact if it was more than just one day," Halden 
said. "We had enough people to manage the workload for one day, but if it 
lasted any longer it would be difficult." 
</P>
<P>
 The three-day sickout was scheduled to enter its final stretch with the 
Tuesday evening shift calling in sick. Officers plan to continue their protests 
tonight by picketing at the Wilshire Ebell Theatre, where Riordan will deliver 
a speech on his public safety plan. 
</P>
<P>
 At Rampart Division -- which had one of the highest sickout participations of 
any station -- a large, middle-aged man sat on a bench in the lobby, waiting 
for the release of a friend who had been arrested over the weekend on charges 
of being drunk and disorderly. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite his friend's arrest, the man said he was on the side of the police 
when it comes to their contract dispute with the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "They should give them a raise, putting their life on the line like they do," 
said the man, who did not want to give his name. "It's been a long time since 
they had a raise. The way things are happening in the street, you can't blame 
them for wanting more money. There's a lot of weirdos out there." 
</P>
<P>
 At the front desk of the station, two policemen patiently answered the 
telephone in between filling out complaints for people standing in line. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's not here," one said into the telephone. "He's ill." 
</P>
<P>
 "No, he's not here today," said the other, a few minutes later. 
</P>
<P>
 Both men, who had been carried over from the previous shift, said they had 
been instructed not to talk to reporters. But one produced a roster of the 
officers who were supposed to have shown up. 
</P>
<P>
 "Seven officers showed up and three of those were probationary officers," he 
said. "You're talking about 40 officers calling in sick." 
</P>
<P>
 Although imaginary ailments were the order of the day, some came up with 
iron-clad excuses. 
</P>
<P>
 The officer whom the city has labeled the underground organizer of the 
sickout, Gary Morgan, scheduled a legitimate minor surgery for Tuesday morning 
to avoid any possibility of discipline. 
</P>
<P>
 At the city's request, a judge had banned Morgan on Friday from encouraging 
officers from participating in the blue flu. 
</P>
<P>
 "I actually had surgery this morning because I'm sure Internal Affairs is 
going to look at me closely," Morgan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other officers insisted that their "sickness" was real -- but tied directly to 
the contract talks. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel we either had to act or continue to be taken advantage of," said one 
veteran patrol officer who did not report to work. "We don't like calling in 
sick but we feel backed into a corner." 
</P>
<P>
 The officer said he called his station and told a supervisor that he was ill. 
He then called his family physician for a note. 
</P>
<P>
 The LAPD says it will seek doctors' notes from all the officers who called in 
sick during the blue flu and may dock the pay or take disciplinary action 
against those who stayed out of work improperly. 
</P>
<P>
 Officers, however, said it was easy to make absences appear legitimate. 
</P>
<P>
 "You tell a doctor you have a migraine headache and they'll write it up," an 
officer said. "They can't prove whether you have it or not." 
</P>
<P>
 Council President John Ferraro said the city ought to go after the doctors who 
are providing notes certifying questionable ailments. "If doctors are giving 
fraudulent claims that people are sick when they aren't sick, they should be 
looked into," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He was not the only council member taking a get-tough tone. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are offering the police officers something that no other employee group 
has gotten and that is a pay raise out of the city's general tax revenues," 
said Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, who chairs the council's budget committee. 
</P>
<P>
 The city has offered 3% raises over the next two years. The union is seeking 
retroactive raises for the two years that officers have worked without a 
contract. A rookie officer earns about $33,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly frustrated, Yaroslavsky noted that only Department of Water and Power 
employees have received a pay raise -- 9% over four years. Money for that 
increase comes from utility receipts that have been more resilient during the 
recession than property and sales taxes that are used to pay police and other 
employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Trash haulers and other blue-collar workers have agreed to no pay raise this 
year and next year. Firefighters, who are also without a contract for the 
fiscal year beginning July 1, have been promised a raise comparable to that 
offered to the police. 
</P>
<P>
 Yaroslavsky, who is a member of the council's negotiating team, said it is 
important for the public to compare treatment of police with that of other city 
workers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not being stingy and cheap and ungrateful to our police," Yaroslavsky 
said. "It's as if, no matter what we put on the table, it's not good enough 
right now." 
</P>
<P>
 Although disruptive and costly, this week's job action increased overall LAPD 
staffing levels because the "modified tactical alert" declared by Chief Willie 
L. Williams allowed the department to keep entire shifts on duty to cover for 
those calling in sick, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think public safety was compromised in any way," Cmdr. Dave Gascon 
said. "We always felt that we had a significant number of options available." 
</P>
<P>
 Among those options was a full tactical alert, during which routine police 
calls could have been ignored to free up officers for only high-priority 
incidents. 
</P>
<P>
 The LAPD also had its emergency operations center activated to respond quickly 
to any developments. As the city's request, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's 
Department had deputies on standby as needed.

ROSTENKOWSKI FACES 17 COUNTS; CONGRESS: ALLEGATIONS AGAINST INFLUENTIAL 
LAWMAKER IN INDICTMENT ARE FAR BROADER THAN EXPECTED. THE PROSECUTOR CHARGES 
'EXTENSIVE FRAUD ON THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Rep. Dan Rostenkowski (D-Ill.) was indicted on 17 felony counts of fraud and 
embezzlement Tuesday, a far broader set of charges than many expected, for 
alleged acts that ranged from taking kickbacks of government funds from a 
son-in-law to buying cars for his family with public and campaign money. 
</P>
<P>
 The 35-year congressman also is accused of personally tampering with a witness 
last September by instructing him not to reveal potentially incriminating 
information to the federal grand jury investigating the case and of using 
government wages to pay employees who performed little official work but did 
such personal chores as photographing one of his daughter's weddings and mowing 
the lawn at his summer home. 
</P>
<P>
 The indictment, which covers more than 20 years of alleged corruption, also 
charged Rostenkowski with using postage vouchers to steal cash from Congress 
and of cashing campaign fund checks at the House post office to disguise them 
as stamp purchases, an outgrowth of an investigation of the now defunct House 
post office. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Atty. Eric H. Holder Jr. announced the charges after plea-bargaining 
talks collapsed and one day after Rostenkowski proclaimed that he is innocent 
and would not accept a plea bargain. Holder said that Rostenkowski "used his 
elective office to perpetrate an extensive fraud on the American people" that 
amounted to hundreds of thousands of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecutor said that the cost of the alleged misconduct "must also be 
measured in terms of the corrosive effect it has on our democratic system of 
government and on the trust our citizens have in their elected officials." 
</P>
<P>
 "The criminal acts of a few feed the cynicism which increasingly haunts our 
political landscape," Holder said. This causes "too many of our citizens to 
assume that all persons in public office are motivated by greed and 
self-interest and to succumb to the defeatist notion that we must resign 
ourselves to the fact that a certain level of political misconduct is a way of 
life." 
</P>
<P>
 House Speaker Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.), contending that Rostenkowski "clearly 
deserves the presumption of innocence," said that the congressman has stepped 
aside as chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee until the charges are 
resolved, in keeping with the rules of the Democratic Caucus. Rep. Sam Gibbons 
(D-Fla.), ranking member of the panel which has a crucial role in handling 
health care reform, will become acting chairman. But Rostenkowski "will 
continue to be fully involved," Foley said. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton tried to minimize the impact on health care legislation, 
saying that "real momentum" has been created and that he is confident the 
legislation will pass this year. 
</P>
<P>
 But the political fallout of the grand jury's action appeared to be 
substantial. Rarely have Rostenkowski's deal-making skills been more sorely 
needed than now, when Clinton is asking a Democratic Congress to take a risky 
leap on health care reform shortly before an election. 
</P>
<P>
 Following the battle over health care, Ways and Means will be at the center of 
other issues that could be crucial to the success of Clinton's presidency -- 
most notably welfare reform, trade and, once again, revamping the Social 
Security system. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet while Rostenkowski's giving up the chairmanship will make the already 
difficult task of passing health legislation even more difficult, few believe 
that the survival of health care reform hinges on having him there to cut 
deals. The political forces at work on the issue are so large that they 
transcend any one person's influence -- even one as important as Rostenkowski. 
</P>
<P>
 As things now stand, sources said Tuesday, the Democrats are within one vote 
of the number they need to pass the bill that Rostenkowski has been putting 
together in private meetings for weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, despite the negotiations surrounding the impending indictment, 
Rostenkowski has devoted himself to the health care bill with a 
single-mindedness that many of his colleagues have found remarkable. 
"Rostenkowski's (bill) is damn near ready," said one Administration official. 
</P>
<P>
 Because he did not agree to a plea bargain that would have forced his 
resignation from Congress, Rostenkowski will remain on the committee. As long 
as it remains possible that he will return to the chairmanship, he can still 
exert influence. And because the committee Democrats will be drafting their 
bill behind closed doors, Rostenkowski may still find a way to operate as the 
panel's de facto chairman, while Gibbons assumes the public role. 
</P>
<P>
 If Rostenkowski were convicted of all the felony counts, he theoretically 
could be sentenced to 110 years in prison and fined a maximum of $365,000, 
excluding any restitution that he might be ordered to pay. But all the charges 
are subject to federal sentencing guidelines, which prescribe ranges of 
punishment depending on such factors as whether the crime involved an abuse of 
trust. 
</P>
<P>
 Holder said that he expects the trial to take place here and last several 
weeks. While arraignment will take place within 10 days, Holder would not 
forecast when the trial would begin. 
</P>
<P>
 The 49-page indictment alleged that Rostenkowski created an elaborate scheme 
to defraud Congress and taxpayers through the misuse of congressional 
allowances involving his office payroll, the House stationery store, the House 
post office and purchase of vehicles. He also was charged with embezzlement, 
conspiracy, obstruction of justice and concealing material facts from Congress 
and the Federal Election Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 In the payroll allegations, Rostenkowski was charged with misappropriating 
approximately $500,000 in taxpayer funds by placing at least 14 people on his 
payroll who did little or no congressional work. 
</P>
<P>
 The workers included a former son-in-law of Rostenkowski who allegedly 
received $10,400 in government salary but performed no work in the 
congressional office and was required to give most of the money back to his 
former father-in-law as cash kickbacks. 
</P>
<P>
 In another arrangement, prosecutors said that the son of an Illinois state 
senator, not identified in the indictment, drew about $48,400 in salary from 
Rostenkowski's congressional office, though he did no official work. Over the 
same 1983-86 time period, the indictment charged, the state senator paid two of 
Rostenkowski's daughters a total of $48,000 through his payroll. 
</P>
<P>
 In the House stationery store scheme, Rostenkowski allegedly obtained more 
than $40,000 worth of valuable merchandise, most of which he handed out as 
gifts to personal friends and associates. But he was accused of charging the 
items to his official expense allowance, which Congress paid. 
</P>
<P>
 The obstruction of justice count involved a House engraver whom Rostenkowski 
allegedly put on his payroll to engrave 50 brass plaques and attach them to 50 
crystal sculptures of the Capitol that he obtained from the House stationery 
store and charged to his official expense allowance. The employee would engrave 
the recipients' first names, add a phrase such as "our pal" and the first names 
of Rostenkowski and his wife -- "LaVerne and Dan." 
</P>
<P>
 Last September the engraver was subpoenaed to testify before the federal grand 
jury looking into Rostenkowski. Before testifying, however, the engraver, whom 
Holder declined to identify, allegedly was instructed by Rostenkowski during a 
telephone call not to tell the grand jury about the Capitol sculptures he had 
engraved for the congressman. 
</P>
<P>
 Holder declined to discuss the provisions of the plea bargain that 
Rostenkowski rejected, against the advice of his lawyers. But a source familiar 
with the negotiations said that it involved admitting some elements of the 
stationery store allegations, the acquisition of vehicles on false grounds and 
the ghost employee charges. The proposed deal also called for Rostenkowski to 
resign from Congress and to serve a six-month jail sentence, the source said. 
</P>
<P>
 The plea bargaining put a strain on relations between Rostenkowski and his 
lawyers, Robert S. Bennett and Carl Rauh, but Bennett was still representing 
him Tuesday morning, Holder said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bennett and Rauh could not be reached on the question of whether Rostenkowski 
is moving to discharge them in favor of what would be a fourth set of attorneys 
to represent him. 
</P>
<P>
 Rostenkowski had no comment Tuesday and the lawmaker's press spokesman, James 
Jaffe, left a recording on his answering machine saying: "We have no statements 
to issue, we have no schedule, we have no bananas." The Case Against the 
Congessman 
</P>
<P>
 The 49-page indictment, which capped a two-year investigation, accuses Rep. 
Dan Rostenkowski of using taxpayer money for his personal benefit.

COLUMN ONE; LAUNCHING SUPERSONIC DREAMS; NASA HOPES TO LEAD U.S. BID TO BUILD A 
BETTER, FASTER AIRLINER. DESPITE SKEPTICS' WARNINGS, ALL MAJOR COMMERCIAL 
CONTRACTORS ARE EXPECTED TO JOIN THE EFFORT TO OUTDO THE CONCORDE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A sleek, needle-nosed jetliner carrying 300 passengers taxis out of Los 
Angeles International Airport, rolls to a hushed takeoff over Playa del Rey 
then accelerates above the Pacific Ocean like no commercial plane in history -- 
reaching 2.4 times the speed of sound nearly 12 miles above the earth. 
</P>
<P>
 The titanium airplane with a cockpit that looks like a video arcade pulls into 
Tokyo in just over four hours -- cutting six hours off the normal trip. Getting 
to Asia from L.A. is no more of a hassle than a hop to Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 Jet-lagged international travelers have been anticipating such an airplane for 
20 years, since Congress halted development of a first-generation supersonic 
jetliner and Europe produced the rival Concorde -- an economic flop. 
</P>
<P>
 Advances in technology have raised hopes in the Clinton Administration that 
the longstanding economic and environmental problems with supersonic jets can 
be overcome -- if the government puts in the seed money. 
</P>
<P>
 Without much fanfare given the stakes, the National Aeronautics and Space 
Administration is poised to issue a $1.5-billion contract in the coming weeks 
to a consortium of every major U.S. commercial airplane and jet engine company 
for an ambitious research program leading to a supersonic jet in regular 
service by 2005. 
</P>
<P>
 NASA hopes Americans would dominate the effort, though it would likely include 
foreign suppliers and investors. It's the sort of colossal industrial project 
that would require enormous investments, carry huge technical risks and raise 
potentially serious environmental concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 Some experts claim NASA is too optimistic about its ability to solve the 
environmental concerns. And the airlines, reeling from traumatic financial 
losses, have voiced little enthusiasm for buying new planes, particularly ones 
a decade away. 
</P>
<P>
 But there is a huge potential payoff if the skeptics are wrong and the plane 
fulfills its promise of being far more fuel-efficient than the Concorde and if 
it can fly without fouling the atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, NASA touts the program as the most important industrial project in the 
nation's future and says it is a key to halting the erosion of American 
dominance of the world aircraft industry. 
</P>
<P>
 At stake is a potential $200 billion in orders for 500 to 1,000 of the 
supersonic aircraft that would support roughly 140,000 manufacturing jobs in 
such areas as Southern California and Seattle, said Wesley Harris, NASA's 
aeronautics chief. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have growing confidence that this plane will be built by 2005 by either 
the U.S. or the Europeans," he said. "Who will build it? U.S. companies must be 
in the driver's seat." 
</P>
<P>
 The strong advocacy reflects a changed attitude at NASA, which for decades has 
sponsored aircraft research that often helped foreign competitors as much as 
Americans and often engaged in academic research with little commercial value. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the Apollo moon missions, NASA's commitment to aeronautics has withered. 
Director Daniel S. Goldin now wants to put more emphasis on helping the U.S. 
aircraft industry, drawing strong support from Congress. Last year, lawmakers 
gave the supersonic program $10 million more than the $187 million requested by 
NASA. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have underfunded aviation research and we need to make substantial 
investments in this area," said Rep. George Brown (D-Colton), chairman of the 
House Science, Space and Technology Committee. "This program is a good thing 
for the nation to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Under the new supersonic program, known as the High Speed Civil Transport, 
NASA will play a central role in organizing the efforts of major U.S. aerospace 
firms and making the key decisions in the next four years about which 
technologies will be used. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time, the archrivals of the commercial aircraft industry will be 
partners under NASA's direction: Boeing and McDonnell Douglas for the jet's 
airframe and General Electric and Pratt & Whitney for the engines. 
</P>
<P>
 By pooling America's best talents, NASA hopes to make the major breakthroughs 
needed to make a supersonic jetliner economically viable. 
</P>
<P>
 That task alone is daunting. 
</P>
<P>
 The program to develop the aircraft, including the detailed engineering of 
millions of parts and the building of thousands of production tools, would 
require a private-sector investment of $15 billion -- more than double the cost 
of past jetliner developments. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if high sales volume defrayed the investment expense, the planes would 
cost $180 million to $300 million each. (A Boeing 747 today costs roughly $150 
million.) 
</P>
<P>
 Proponents argue that the high price would be offset by the aircraft's ability 
to make two trips for every one that a subsonic plane makes. As a result, fares 
would be no more than 20% higher than current tickets, Boeing and McDonnell 
Douglas engineers say. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would make this an airplane for everybody, not just high-paying 
passengers," said Bruce Bunin, McDonnell's manager for the program in Long 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Keeping costs low will also require that the plane be highly fuel-efficient, 
meaning its structure must be very lightweight, engines must be highly 
economical and aerodynamic drag must be at a minimum. 
</P>
<P>
 Because U.S. law prohibits commercial planes creating sonic booms over land, 
the jets would fly supersonically only above the ocean. A failing of the 
100-passenger Concorde has been its gross inefficiency in flying subsonically, 
an area where the new plane must excel. After Congress forbid supersonic 
flights over land in the 1970s, the market for Concordes collapsed; fewer than 
30 were built. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the Concorde, the new jet would have flaps and slats that would change 
the shape of the wing depending on the plane's speed, allowing it to fly nearly 
as efficiently as today's jetliners. 
</P>
<P>
 But even if the plane can do all this, it is not clear that airlines will rush 
to buy it. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. airlines have collectively lost $12 billion in four years, and their 
enthusiasm for costly new planes seems tepid at best. American Airlines 
spokesman Al Becker said the supersonic jet carries high risk and may be too 
specialized for the flexible fleet his company wants. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an industry that is struggling desperately for survival," he said. 
"We are in no position to be thinking about buying large numbers of 
$200-million airplanes. Where are we going to raise that kind of money?" 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of a supersonic jet, airlines may opt for a proposed 600-passenger 
super-jumbo plane that Boeing and McDonnell Douglas are studying. It would 
involve much less technical risk and may be more adaptable to different routes. 
</P>
<P>
 The Air Transport Assn., the trade group representing U.S. airlines, has not 
considered the supersonic jet as a priority, a spokesman said. And the program 
is not even mentioned in McDonnell's or Boeing's 1993 shareholder reports. 
</P>
<P>
 NASA officials, however, believe any reservations about the supersonic planes 
are myopic. 
</P>
<P>
 Just build the plane and "the market will be there," claims Louis J. Williams, 
director of the supersonic program at NASA. Commercial air travel is growing at 
8% to 10% per year, he said, and international travel growth is paralleling the 
explosion in international trade. 
</P>
<P>
 Weary business travelers would flock to a supersonic plane that promises to 
reduce jet lag. If executives can get to Tokyo or Paris, conduct business and 
board a return flight on the same day, they may never have to adjust to a 
different time zone. 
</P>
<P>
 "From the traveling public's perception, I am not sure we have done much for 
them in the past 20 years," said Sam Gilkey, head of GE's effort to develop a 
supersonic engine. "This plane offers more to the public than a 600-seat plane 
you hear so much about." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, even in an industry where firms bet their survival on each new product, 
the supersonic plane carries unique risks. 
</P>
<P>
 It will require entirely new high-technology materials, computerized jet 
engine controls and even new research into human behavior. For example, when 
pilots land the jet, instead of looking out the window, they would rely on 
"synthetic vision" that would resemble a video game screen. 
</P>
<P>
 It would be the first time that pilots could not directly see the runway, 
because the cockpit in a supersonic jet is angled up so sharply. In the 
Concorde, the cockpit is mounted on hinges and tilts down at landing to allow 
the pilots to see, but the design imposes a big weight and drag penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 The technical hurdles are so great that "we don't know yet whether there is a 
viable commercial program out there," Boeing program manager Mike Henderson 
admits. "It is a research program right now." 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, the prospects appear better than in 1971, when in a titanic 
political battle Congress voted to kill the supersonic program, overriding the 
unusual alliance of President Richard Nixon, labor boss George Meany and the 
aerospace industry. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision was based largely on environmental concerns -- the same issue 
that haunts today's effort. 
</P>
<P>
 NASA and industry officials believe they have licked a longstanding concern 
that a fleet of supersonic commercial jets flying through the stratosphere 
would seriously degrade the ozone. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, NASA has invested $500 million into research on supersonic 
jet engines that would cut pollution by controlling combustion and fuel air 
mixture. NASA's aims to reduce nitrogen oxide emissions eightfold, compared to 
existing engines, which emit five grams of nitrogen oxide for each kilogram of 
fuel burned. 
</P>
<P>
 A NASA-funded study has estimated that the supersonic fleet would cause the 
loss of 1% of the ozone layer, a level that NASA officials believe will be 
politically acceptable. But some environmentalists differ sharply. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Oppenheimer, an atmospheric physicist with the Environmental Defense 
Fund and a participant in the NASA studies, suggests the study was far too 
uncertain to accurately predict a 1% loss. He added, however, that even a 1% 
erosion is too much given damage already done to the ozone. 
</P>
<P>
 Because about 5% of the ozone over North America has already been lost to 
pollution, another 1% would allow even higher concentrations of ultraviolet 
radiation, raising skin cancer rates, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Is Joe Six Pack going to be willing to suffer an increased dose of 
ultraviolet radiation so some jet-setters can fly to Japan quicker?" he asked. 
"I am skeptical." 
</P>
<P>
 But a recent independent report by the National Research Council generally 
praised NASA's efforts to address environmental concerns. Thomas E. Graedel, 
the study's chairman and a Bell Labs scientist, told Congress in February that 
he could see no environmental issues that would preclude the operation of a 
supersonic jet. 
</P>
<P>
 Two other environmental issues also loom large. 
</P>
<P>
 A fleet of jets -- traveling at Mach 2.4, or about 1,600 m.p.h. -- would cause 
sonic booms over thousands of square miles of ocean each day, subjecting marine 
life to "repetitive sonic trauma," a scientist on the House Space, Science and 
Technology Committee noted. The impact is unknown, though NASA experts consider 
it relatively minor. 
</P>
<P>
 Another concern is the potential for the jets to change weather patterns, 
according to the National Research Council report. The fleet could affect water 
vapor and cloud formations, it suggested. 
</P>
<P>
 (Military jets routinely fly supersonically, but they limit their booms to 
military air spaces and they can fly supersonically only briefly at altitudes 
lower than the proposed commercial plane, thus limiting environmental impact.) 
</P>
<P>
 Oppenheimer said the program will make economic sense only when the 
environmental issues are resolved. He compares the proposed jets to nuclear 
power plants, in which the government encouraged electric utilities to spend 
billions on a technology the public ultimately rejected on environmental 
grounds. 
</P>
<P>
 But aviation has always had unique public support. It occupies a special place 
in American history and plays a key role in the U.S. economy. Commercial 
aircraft are America's leading export. 
</P>
<P>
 A decade ago, American aircraft makers held 90% of the world market for large 
jetliners, according to Harris of NASA; today it's 70%. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the threat of foreign competition, a U.S. program is almost certain to 
have suppliers and investors in Europe and Japan -- much like the newly 
introduced Boeing 777 jetliner. Neither Boeing nor McDonnell have the financial 
capability alone for a $15-billion development program. 
</P>
<P>
 Boeing and McDonnell are part of an international group studying the economics 
and marketing of a supersonic jet. While U.S. technology looks superior, the 20 
years of Concorde have given Europeans important insights. 
</P>
<P>
 At issue is whether the NASA research program will give the United States the 
dominant technological position internationally. With the lead role, U.S. 
industry would then be in a position to decide when to launch production of the 
jet. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe it is the most critical manufacturing decision this country will 
make in the next 10 years," Harris said. New Technologies Required for Building 
Supersonic Jet 
</P>
<P>
 The new supersonic jetliner sponsored by a $1.5-billion NASA research contract 
would require major breakthroughs in aircraft technology. 
</P>
<P>
 Among them: 
</P>
<P>
 * Aerodynamic drag must be cut to an absolute minimum. One technique involves 
a radical new design in which massive pumps would suck turbulent air off the 
skin of the wings through millions of microscopic holes. The so-called laminar 
flow over the wings would be virtually free of turbulence, cutting the drag. 
</P>
<P>
 * The 311-foot-long jet must be so light that its structure would probably be 
built in large part with thin sheets of titanium, held together through an 
exotic process called super plastic diffusion bonding. 
</P>
<P>
 * Engines that power supersonic jets are notoriously noisy, but the new planes 
would have to keep quiet if they want a chance at wide acceptance. A new design 
for the exhaust nozzles is expected to allow the plane to meet existing airport 
noise standards. 
</P>
<P>
 * Inside the engines, the combustion chamber, or "combustors," would operate 
at 3,600 degrees, hot enough to melt existing steel alloys and about 700 
degrees hotter than existing engines. NASA is betting that a new 
fiber-reinforced ceramic composite liner would stand up to the heat. 
</P>
<P>
 * To prevent severe environmental damage, the engines must emit no more than 
five grams of nitrogen oxide for each kilogram of fuel burned. One proposed 
system would mix fuel and air in the engine upstream from the normal burning 
zone, allowing the lean fuel mix to vaporize better. The other proposed system 
would create a stratified fuel mixture, first injecting excess fuel and then 
adding air later in the combustion to create a lean stage -- a concept called 
rich burn-quick quench-lean burn. 
</P>
<P>
 * NASA is still hoping to find ways to reduce the sonic boom generated by the 
jet as it flies over the ocean. A boom, which is the acoustic shock wave 
trailing an aircraft, is a function of an aircraft's mass, shape and its speed. 
Although cutting the boom is possible, it must be done without significantly 
hampering flight efficiency.

RIORDAN CALLS FOR MEDIATOR IN LAPD SICKOUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARC LACEY and JAMES RAINEY, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles police officers staged Day 2 of their mass sickout Tuesday, 
causing only minor disruption of public service but exasperating city officials 
and prompting Mayor Richard Riordan to call for a mediator to step in. 
</P>
<P>
 In an unusual joint appearance designed to signal the seriousness and 
solidarity of the city's leadership, Riordan appeared with seven council 
members standing behind him as he spelled out the city's budget woes. 
</P>
<P>
 "The city respects the police and wants to give them a raise and reward them 
for a job well done," Riordan said. "(But) the city is facing the gravest 
financial situation since the Great Depression." 
</P>
<P>
 The mayor called on the officers union, the Police Protective League, to 
permit an impartial mediator to settle the two-year dispute. 
</P>
<P>
 "If mediation is rejected, the council will have no other choice in my opinion 
and I believe they will vote for an impasse," Riordan said. 
</P>
<P>
 After the declaration of an impasse, the city could call in a mediator without 
the union's approval; if mediation fails, the city could impose a contract 
unilaterally. 
</P>
<P>
 Although officially unsanctioned by the officers union, the job action known 
as "Blue Flu II" enjoyed wide support from the rank and file Tuesday: Of 548 
officers scheduled to report to day watch duty, 248 -- or 45% -- called in 
sick. (Other officers were ordered to work double shifts to cover for their 
"ailing" colleagues.) 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan's show of solidarity with City Council members angered unhappy 
officers even more, to the point that all but three West Valley Division 
officers scheduled to work the overnight "morning watch" called in sick, 
according to an officer in the station who declined to give his name. 
</P>
<P>
 At the LAPD's six Valley divisions, more officers failed to show up for work 
on day shifts Tuesday than had stayed away the day before -- 44%, up from 39% 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Union leaders denounced the mayor's suggestion that a mediator be appointed, 
condemning it as a stalling tactic that would escalate the dispute. They also 
decried the increasingly rancorous tenor of the management-labor dispute. 
</P>
<P>
 "This should be a civilized discussion," said Geoffrey Garfield, spokesman for 
the Police Protective League. "Instead, it's become a jungle -- the 
back-and-forth, the heightened tensions, the sickout. The city is banging its 
chest saying it wants to be king of the jungle and we're doing the same. 
Meanwhile, the citizens are wondering what's going on." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, most citizens are feeling the sickout's effects lightly -- if at all. 
But some apparently are being spared traffic citations. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly a third of the 34 officers assigned to the Valley Traffic Division 
failed to report for the day shift Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We probably have fewer traffic enforcement officers out there so we might not 
be able to write as many tickets as we usually would," said Lt. Joe Rezzo. "But 
we're in real good shape as far as coverage to the community is concerned, and 
we are well-prepared to respond to any emergencies." 
</P>
<P>
 At Foothill Division's detective bureau in Pacoima, investigations of some 
crime reports -- especially those involving misdemeanors -- were being delayed 
at least a day, said the station's chief of detectives, Lt. Gary Halden. Fewer 
than half the detectives and other inspectors employed there arrived for work 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be a tremendous impact if it was more than just one day," Halden 
said. "We had enough people to manage the workload for one day, but if it 
lasted any longer it would be difficult." 
</P>
<P>
 The three-day sickout was scheduled to enter its final stretch with the 
Tuesday evening shift calling in sick. Officers plan to continue their protests 
tonight by picketing at the Wilshire Ebell Theatre, where Riordan will deliver 
a speech on his public safety plan. 
</P>
<P>
 For the second consecutive day Tuesday, the West Valley station was the 
hardest hit in the Valley: more than two-thirds of the officers scheduled for 
duty called in sick, forcing many from the graveyard shift to remain on 
overtime. 
</P>
<P>
 But those who did show up remained upbeat. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're just hanging in there like troopers," said Sgt. Stephanie Payne, the 
day watch commander. "When they know they have to do something, no one 
complains. It's like a normal day, really." 
</P>
<P>
 Others were more circumspect. "It could get a little old if this thing drags 
on," acknowledged one officer, who declined to give his name. 
</P>
<P>
 At Rampart Division -- which had one of the highest sickout participations of 
any station -- a large, middle-aged man sat in the lobby, waiting for the 
release of a friend who had been arrested over the weekend on charges of being 
drunk and disorderly. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite his friend's arrest, the man said he was on the side of the police 
when it comes to their contract dispute with the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "They should give them a raise, putting their life on the line like they do," 
said the man, who did not want to give his name. "It's been a long time since 
they had a raise. The way things are happening in the street, you can't blame 
them for wanting more money. There's a lot of weirdos out there." 
</P>
<P>
 At the front desk of the station, two policemen patiently answered the 
telephone in between filling out complaints for people standing in line. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's not here," one said into the telephone. "He's ill." 
</P>
<P>
 "No, he's not here today," said the other, a few minutes later. 
</P>
<P>
 Both men, who had been carried over from the previous shift, said they had 
been instructed not to talk to reporters. But one produced a roster of the 
officers who were supposed to have shown up. 
</P>
<P>
 "Seven officers showed up and three of those were probationary officers," he 
said. "You're talking about 40 officers calling in sick." 
</P>
<P>
 Although imaginary ailments were the order of the day, some came up with 
iron-clad excuses. 
</P>
<P>
 The officer whom the city has labeled the underground organizer of the 
sickout, Gary Morgan, scheduled a legitimate minor surgery for Tuesday morning 
to avoid any possibility of discipline. 
</P>
<P>
 At the city's request, a judge had banned Morgan on Friday from encouraging 
officers from participating in the blue flu. 
</P>
<P>
 Other officers insisted that their "sickness" was real -- but tied directly to 
the contract talks. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel we either had to act or continue to be taken advantage of," said one 
veteran patrol officer who did not report to work. "We don't like calling in 
sick but we feel backed into a corner." 
</P>
<P>
 The LAPD says it will seek doctors' notes from all the officers who called in 
sick during the blue flu and may dock the pay or take disciplinary action 
against those who stayed out of work improperly. 
</P>
<P>
 Officers, however, said it was easy to make absences appear legitimate. 
</P>
<P>
 "You tell a doctor you have a migraine headache and they'll write it up," an 
officer said. "They can't prove whether you have it or not." 
</P>
<P>
 Council President John Ferraro said the city ought to go after the doctors who 
are providing notes certifying questionable ailments. 
</P>
<P>
 He was not the only council member taking a get-tough tone. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are offering the police officers something that no other employee group 
has gotten and that is a pay raise out of the city's general tax revenues," 
said Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, who chairs the council's budget committee. 
</P>
<P>
 The city has offered 3% raises over the next two years. The union is seeking 
retroactive raises for the two years that officers have worked without a 
contract. A rookie officer earns about $33,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly frustrated, Yaroslavsky noted that only Department of Water and Power 
employees have received a pay raise -- 9% over four years. Money for that 
increase comes from utility receipts that have been more resilient during the 
recession than property and sales taxes that are used to pay police and other 
employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Trash haulers and other blue-collar workers have agreed to no pay raise this 
year and next year. Firefighters, who are also without a contract for the 
fiscal year beginning July 1, have been promised a raise comparable to that 
offered to the police. 
</P>
<P>
 Yaroslavsky, who is a member of the council's negotiating team, said it is 
important for the public to compare treatment of police with that of other city 
workers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not being stingy and cheap and ungrateful to our police," Yaroslavsky 
said. "It's as if, no matter what we put on the table, it's not good enough 
right now." 
</P>
<P>
 Although disruptive and costly, this week's job action increased overall LAPD 
staffing levels because the "modified tactical alert" declared by Chief Willie 
L. Williams allowed the department to keep entire shifts on duty to cover for 
those calling in sick, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think public safety was compromised in any way," Cmdr. Dave Gascon 
said. "We always felt that we had a significant number of options available." 
</P>
<P>
 Among those options was a full tactical alert, during which routine police 
calls could have been ignored to free up officers for only high-priority 
incidents. 
</P>
<P>
 The LAPD also had its emergency operations center activated to respond quickly 
to any developments. As the city's request, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's 
Department had deputies on standby as needed.

PANEL OKS POLICY ALLOWING LIMITED COYOTE TRAPPING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HUGO MARTIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Animal Regulation Commission decided Tuesday to allow city 
employees in limited circumstances to trap and kill coyotes in residential 
areas, modifying its almost year-old ban on the practice but failing to satisfy 
homeowners and animal rights activists at odds over the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the new policy, animal regulation officers will charge residents a $200 
fee to set traps, but only after property owners meet certain conditions -- for 
example, putting up a fence to deter coyote intrusions. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision by the panel culminates the latest chapter of the often-heated 
debate among wildlife advocates and others, who say trapping is an inhumane and 
ineffective policy, and homeowners, particularly in the San Fernando Valley, 
who maintain trapping is needed to protect pets and children from attacks. 
</P>
<P>
 The new policy replaces a trapping ban that residents say resulted in a 
dramatic increase in coyote sightings since it was adopted 11 months ago. But 
officials said it would have been too costly to reinstitute trapping on demand. 
</P>
<P>
 Several animal rights activists said the fee imposed under the new policy 
should be increased to more closely reflect the estimated $5,800 the city 
spends to set and maintain each trap. Others denounced the practice of trapping 
under any circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents of the ban complained that the criteria are so difficult to meet 
that the new policy, in essence, continues the ban. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are so many caveats that it leaves the ban in place," said Michael 
Lazarou, a Woodland Hills resident and vocal opponent of the ban, who contends 
that a coyote stalked his toddler son in his back yard last December. 
</P>
<P>
 The policy, unanimously approved by the commission, was recommended by Gary 
Olsen, the Animal Regulation Department's general manager. The city will set 
traps for a resident only under the following circumstances: 
</P>
<P>
 * An animal regulation official must first visit the home of the resident who 
has complained about a coyote problem and provide educational material that 
explains the habits of the animal and ways to protect against coyote attacks. 
</P>
<P>
 * The official must then recommend mitigation measures, such as installing 
tall fences, to deter a coyote from entering the property. The resident must 
implement those measures before trapping can occur. 
</P>
<P>
 * The resident must then sign an affidavit that the measures have been 
implemented and agree to waive the city's liability in case a pet or child is 
caught in the trap. The resident must also notify all residents within 300 
yards of the property that trapping will occur. 
</P>
<P>
 * Once all of the above criteria are met, the city will charge the resident 
$200 to set and maintain a trap on the property until a coyote is caught or 
until an animal regulation official determines that the problem no longer 
exists. 
</P>
<P>
 The city may also allow limited trapping when a coyote is suspected of having 
rabies because of an attack on a person, when a county, state or federal agency 
mandates it due to public safety concerns, or when a coyote is sick or injured. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission will review the policy after a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Olsen said he expects the policy will dramatically reduce the number of 
coyotes trapped annually. During the year before the ban, the department 
trapped and killed 35 coyotes, city officials said. (State law requires the 
city to kill a trapped coyote and forbids it from relocating the animal to 
other areas within the state). 
</P>
<P>
 Before voting on the recommendation, commission President Mimi Robins said she 
realized that the new policy will not satisfy all sides on the highly 
contentious issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically, this is an ugly issue and regardless of what the commission does, 
not everyone will be happy," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The trapping controversy began in June, 1993, when the commission voted -- 
partly in response to pressure from animal rights advocates -- to halt the 
trapping of coyotes by city employees. The panel left residents the option of 
hiring a certified pest control company to trap the animal. Such companies 
charge about $800 to trap coyotes. 
</P>
<P>
 But since the ban, hillside residents, mostly in the West Valley, have 
complained about an increase in coyote sightings and attacks on pets. A city 
report said the city gets about 500 calls per year about coyote sightings, but 
how much they have increased was not immediately available. 
</P>
<P>
 At a March 23 hearing in Woodland Hills, the commission instructed Olsen to 
suggest a trapping policy that would take into consideration the concerns from 
both sides of the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 In his report, Olsen offered four options: continue the ban, lift it outright, 
impose the criteria for trapping and charge a fee, or adopt the criteria and 
charge no fee. 
</P>
<P>
 Lt. Willie McDaniel, an Animal Regulation Department supervisor who drafted 
the list of options for the commission, said that the financially strapped city 
cannot afford to return to a policy of providing trapping upon request. 
</P>
<P>
 Several activists who had pressed for the ban on trapping said they generally 
support the new trapping policy, but only if the fee is increased to about $500 
so that residents pay a larger share of the trapping cost. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think this is fair," said Norma Sandler, director of the Wildlife 
Protection League. "I don't think this is equitable." 
</P>
<P>
 Lila Brooks, the head of the California Wildlife Defenders who has lobbied the 
city for more than 20 years to ban coyote trapping, denounced the commission 
decision, saying the city should allow no trapping at all. 
</P>
<P>
 She noted that wildlife experts believe that every time a coyote is killed, 
the coyote population grows to fill the void. Killing coyotes, the experts 
maintain, results in a greater food supply for those remaining, thereby 
increasing the likelihood that females will have larger litters. 
</P>
<P>
 "This method is ineffective," she told the commission. "Why continue a 
(policy) that is ineffective?"

FAA INCREASES SPAN BETWEEN 757S, SMALLER PLANES; AVIATION: THE FOUR-MILE 
DISTANCE IS DESIGNED TO PREVENT ACCIDENTS INVOLVING WAKE TURBULENCE. THE NTSB 
HAD URGED SIX MILES.

 Citing a crash that killed five people in Santa Ana in December, the Federal 
Aviation Administration has adopted a policy that will require smaller planes 
to stay farther behind Boeing 757 jetliners to prevent airplane accidents 
caused by their potentially hazardous wake turbulence. 
</P>
<P>
 But the regulatory agency's action -- part of a detailed set of new policies 
on 757s -- falls short of safety recommendations made by the National 
Transportation Safety Board this year. Aviation safety experts and pilots' 
advocates said the changes are merely a first step toward making the skies safe 
for aircraft landing and taking off behind 757 jetliners. 
</P>
<P>
 FAA Administrator David R. Hinson outlined the policy in recent days in a 
letter to NTSB Chairman Carl W. Vogt. 
</P>
<P>
 Beginning July 1, the FAA will require air traffic controllers handling 
landings to keep aircraft four miles behind 757s -- instead of the current 
three miles -- to protect them from the miniature hurricanes produced by rapid 
air movement across the larger aircraft's wings. 
</P>
<P>
 The safety board recommended in February that the FAA adopt minimum separation 
distances of up to six miles behind 757s. The FAA is not bound by the NTSB's 
recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
 At least two accidents that claimed 13 lives and three other serious incidents 
have been linked to 757 wake turbulence since December, 1992. Because the 
separation rules could potentially decrease the number of flights at the 
nation's airports and cut into revenues of the hard-hit airline industry, the 
FAA has been reluctant to increase distances between 757s and tailing 
airplanes. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the NTSB does not consider the 757 to have any structural flaws, 
researchers have speculated that its unique, sleek-wing design may be the cause 
of the turbulence that can be unusually powerful for an aircraft of its size. 
</P>
<P>
 Both fatal accidents occurred when smaller jets flew into wake turbulence as 
they were preparing to land. 
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Ana crash occurred when a twin-engine corporate jet was on a landing 
approach to John Wayne International Airport. The jet, which was 2.1 miles 
behind a Boeing 757, went out of control and slammed nose-first into the ground 
near the Santa Ana Auto Mall. All five aboard, including the top two executives 
of the In-N-Out Burger chain, were killed. The NTSB is still investigating the 
accident, but turbulence from the 757 is said to have played a part. 
</P>
<P>
 The other fatal crash occurred in Billings, Mont., in 1992. Eight people were 
killed. 
</P>
<P>
 NTSB spokesman Mike Benson said the safety board will review the FAA's new 
policies and draft a response over the next several weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Flocke, a spokesman for the Air Line Pilots Assn., said: "We think it's a 
good beginning. It certainly addresses part of our concern. But it doesn't, for 
instance, address separation on departures." 
</P>
<P>
 The association, the largest pilots organization in the world, recently issued 
its own advisory on 757s, recommending that pilots of smaller aircraft -- even 
MD-80s, Boeing 737s and DC-9s -- remain five miles or at least two minutes 
behind 757s on final approach, Flocke said. The organization also has 
recommended that pilots ask the control tower for extra time when taking off 
behind 757s, Flocke said, to give more time for the turbulence to diminish. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite concerns from other corners of the aviation industry, the FAA said it 
believes that the four-mile separation is safe enough -- for now. 
</P>
<P>
 "The FAA believes that this interim increased separation will provide an extra 
margin of safety without unnecessarily impacting system capacity," Hinson wrote 
in a May 20 letter outlining the changes to Vogt. 
</P>
<P>
 The four-mile separation, Hinson wrote, recently was adopted by the Civil 
Aviation Authority in England and "has significantly reduced the number of 
reported incidents" there. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of its new policies on 757s, Hinson said, the FAA is embarking on a 
two-year test with the help of the National Aeronautics and Space 
Administration to determine the precise level of danger that 757 wake 
turbulence poses. The four-mile separation limit will remain in effect until 
testing shows whether additional distance is warranted, Hinson said. 
</P>
<P>
 After its investigation, the NTSB in February unanimously advised the FAA to 
overhaul its 20-year-old aircraft weight classification system, which is used 
to set separation distances. 
</P>
<P>
 The FAA said an overhaul was not warranted now, but that it would study the 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Leo Garodz, a former FAA manager who was among the first to bring the 757 wake 
turbulence problem to the agency's attention in 1991, said the new policies 
represented an initial step, but nothing more. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a beginning, but it's only a beginning, because there's going to be 
another accident, because things are not that precise at airports when there is 
a heavy traffic load," Garodz said.

ASSEMBLY OKS RIGHTS BILL FOR UNWED COUPLES; LEGISLATION: THE DEMOCRATIC MEASURE 
COULD BENEFIT THE STATE'S HALF-MILLION COHABITANTS, INCLUDING GAY COUPLES. AN 
UNCERTAIN FATE AWAITS IT IN THE SENATE. 
</P>

<P>
 Without a vote to spare, the Assembly on Tuesday approved legislation allowing 
gay and other unmarried couples to officially register their relationships with 
the state and share rights now enjoyed by married couples. 
</P>
<P>
 A 41-26 Democrat-Republican vote, the exact margin needed for approval, sent 
the bill by Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar) to the Senate, where its fate 
is uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
 The measure would establish a legal framework for domestic partnerships, 
require hospitals to grant partner visitation rights and change state law 
relating to wills and conservatorships. 
</P>
<P>
 Couples registering with the secretary of state would have to be older than 
18, not related by blood, agree to share joint living expenses, and not have 
been part of another domestic relationship for six months. 
</P>
<P>
 "This bill is critical to the half-million people who live together in 
California and need to know they can rely on their partner in an emergency," 
Katz said, noting that the bill affects more than just gay couples. "What it 
does is let people who care about each other take care of each other in 
emergencies. It relates to hospital visits, conservatorships and willing 
property. These are three basic rights that all people ought to have." 
</P>
<P>
 But opponents of the bill charged that it would condone homosexuality, erode 
the sanctity of marriage and demean family values. 
</P>
<P>
 "The real purpose of this bill is to establish a state-sanctioned relationship 
for all people, but particularly for the homosexual community, that is equal to 
marriage," said Assemblyman Bernie Richter (R-Chico). "It is an obvious attempt 
to (make) legitimate the homosexual lifestyle." 
</P>
<P>
 "This bill will encourage same-sex marriages and is against morality," 
declared Assemblyman Richard Mountjoy (R-Arcadia). 
</P>
<P>
 But a supporter, Assemblywoman Julie Bornstein (D-Palm Desert) replied: "Adam 
and Eve had no clergy to marry them, but they had a committed relationship. 
This bill is reasonable and humane and falls in line with biblical tradition." 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not a same-sex marriage bill; it is not even close," Assemblyman John 
Burton (D-San Francisco) said. 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblyman Tom Umberg (D-Garden Grove) predicted that 20 years from now 
people will look back and say the debate on the bill was "rather silly" because 
some Assembly members will be openly gay. 
</P>
<P>
 Katz said the 1990 federal census showed that there were 495,223 unmarried 
couples living together in California, including 93% opposite-sex couples, 7% 
same-sex couples and 35,218 senior citizen couples, about 7% of the total 
number of unmarried partners. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are tens of thousands of senior citizens who live together for 
companionship or don't marry because it's much harder to live on one Social 
Security check than on the benefits provided to two individuals," Katz said. 
"But these couples rely on each other every day for comfort and support. 
</P>
<P>
 After the Assembly vote, Katz said he expected another "very close vote" in 
the Senate where the votes of 21 of the 40 members will be required for 
approval. 
</P>
<P>
 Roger Coggan of Los Angeles, co-chairman of the LIFE AIDS Lobby, which helped 
sponsor the measure, said the group will "redouble (its) efforts in the Senate 
and get this bill on the governor's desk before the legislative summer recess. 
If enacted, this would be the first domestic partnership registration law in 
any state in the U.S."

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / GOVERNOR; GARAMENDI, BROWN ATTACK ADS SIGNAL NASTY 
FINISH TO RACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY WALLACE, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One week before the primary election, the two leading Democratic candidates 
for governor went on the attack Tuesday, broadcasting television advertisements 
that jabbed at each other's perceived weak spots and seemed to bode for a 
nasty, combative finish. 
</P>
<P>
 Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi's campaign struck first, unveiling a 
30-second and a 10-second spot that call attention to state Treasurer Kathleen 
Brown's personal opposition to the death penalty. "My opponent, Kathleen Brown, 
is against the death penalty. I support it and I'll carry it out," Garamendi 
says in one ad, failing to mention that Brown says she, too, would carry out 
executions if she is elected. 
</P>
<P>
 Just hours after Garamendi's ad was made public, Brown's staff revealed that 
she would respond in kind, skewering Garamendi for how he handled the failure 
of Executive Life Insurance Co. "John Garamendi for governor?" asks Brown's ad. 
"Now that's putting California into the wrong hands." 
</P>
<P>
 The campaign cross-fire, which began airing Tuesday night and will continue 
for at least a few days, prompted sighs from some political observers. 
</P>
<P>
 "My God, here we go again," said pollster Mervin Field. "They've both 
descended to the routine low road. . . . Think about the money down the drain." 
</P>
<P>
 "This underscores there is no such thing as civility in politics anymore," 
said political analyst Sherry Bebitch Jeffe of the Claremont Graduate School. 
"There is no such thing as party loyalty." 
</P>
<P>
 Staffers for both campaigns defended the ads as a necessary way to inform the 
Democratic electorate, which will choose among Brown, Garamendi and state Sen. 
Tom Hayden on June 7. But each side accused the other of distorting the facts 
and of being desperate. 
</P>
<P>
 John Whitehurst, a spokesman for the Brown campaign, said "Garamendi's 
misleading commercial is the hollow sound of a 20-year career coming to a 
whimpering end." Whitehurst took issue with the ad's assertion that Brown "has 
said she'd vote against laws to expand (death penalty) use." 
</P>
<P>
 The statement is true as far as it goes, Whitehurst said. But Brown has also 
said that as governor she would make sure any effort to expand the death 
penalty would go before the voters, and that she would act in accordance with 
the will of the people. 
</P>
<P>
 "The issue is: As governor will she allow that expansion law to be put before 
the voters? And the answer to that is yes," Whitehurst said. 
</P>
<P>
 Darry Sragow, Garamendi's campaign manager, challenged the accuracy of the 
Brown ad. The ad begins with a 64-year-old widow named Helen McGrath, who says 
she was counting on insurance payments from Executive Life for survival, but 
"because of John Garamendi, I don't know that I'll see any of these payments in 
my lifetime." 
</P>
<P>
 The ad continues: "When . . . Garamendi seized Executive Life, the result was 
financial disaster." 
</P>
<P>
 Sragow countered: "When John seized Executive Life he was attempting to undo 
and resolve a financial disaster. And the fact is that 92% of the policyholders 
will be paid in full. . . . Are some of the other 8% unhappy? Yes. And the 
Brown camp I guess found (one of those people). 
</P>
<P>
 "This just shows how desperate they are to keep voters focused on something 
other than Kathleen's opposition to the death penalty," said Sragow, who noted 
that in February, Brown asked her opponents to sign what she called an "honest 
and clean campaign pledge" to prohibit attack advertising. 
</P>
<P>
 Whitehurst was unapologetic. "This campaign isn't just going to sit there and 
get hit," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Whitehurst said Brown's attack ad will be interspersed with another new ad, a 
biographical commercial that shows Brown cuddling her children. Having been 
"raised in the family of California," the ad says, "grandmother Kathleen Brown 
is fighting for the California family." 
</P>
<P>
 The Brown campaign has spent $500,000 on this week's media purchase, 
Whitehurst said, but may spend more before Election Day. 
</P>
<P>
 Sragow called Garamendi's focus on the death penalty a "precise message to 
motivate voters." He admitted that the candidate may have trouble getting the 
message out. Although Garamendi will have up to $1 million to spend on air 
time, Sragow said, the airwaves are so jammed with political advertising that 
there may not be $1 million worth of air time left to buy. 
</P>
<P>
 As of Tuesday, Garamendi had spent $100,000 to air the ad in San Diego and Los 
Angeles, Sragow said. Beginning today, the ad will appear in additional 
markets, he said.

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / U.S. SENATE; FEINSTEIN'S DEBUT AD SAYS HUFFINGTON DODGED 
STATE INCOME TAX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE LESHER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In her first political commercials of the campaign, Sen. Dianne Feinstein on 
Tuesday portrayed Rep. Michael Huffington, her likely Republican challenger, as 
a millionaire Texas carpetbagger who dodged California income taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington (R-Santa Barbara) said he had done nothing to avoid paying his 
proper taxes and described the ads as "a desperate act from a desperate 
politician. There won't be any political impact because it will backfire on 
her." 
</P>
<P>
 The tax question stems from Huffington and his wife claiming separate 
residences from 1988 to 1991. Huffington saved hundreds of thousands of dollars 
because there is no state income tax in Texas, where he filed, Feinstein's 
campaign spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein campaign officials stopped short of saying that Huffington acted 
illegally, calling instead for an investigation by the state Franchise Tax 
Board to determine his residence during those years. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington, who faced the same criticism in his 1992 House race, said he lived 
in Houston because he was working full time at his family's oil and gas company 
until it was sold in mid-1991. He said he spent weekends in Santa Barbara, 
where his wife was living at the couple's mansion. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington won his first elected office less than a year after moving to 
California, unseating a veteran Republican congressman. He is the front-runner 
in next Tuesday's GOP Senate primary, due largely to the $6.3 million he has 
given his campaign from his personal fortune. 
</P>
<P>
 With the primary a week away, GOP rival William E. Dannemeyer also launched 
his strongest attack of the campaign, faxing to reporters a series of pointed 
questions, including the tax-dodging charge. 
</P>
<P>
 The tax issue forced Huffington into the no-win situation of defending himself 
by highlighting his recent Texas roots. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had a Texas driver's license, I was employed in Texas, I voted in Texas, my 
doctors were in Texas, I was born in Texas and my residence was in Texas," 
Huffington said Tuesday. "Almost my entire life, I was a Texas resident. . . . 
They're going to say, 'He was a Texan.' Well, you're right. I am now a 
Californian." 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington has spent much of the spring attacking Feinstein's record on taxes 
and crime. A Times poll last week indicated that the effort has helped cut 
Feinstein's lead over Huffington in a hypothetical matchup by half. 
</P>
<P>
 With the television ads, Feinstein's strategists took aim at a perceived open 
flank in the Huffington campaign; recent polls show that more than 60% of the 
voters don't know much about him. 
</P>
<P>
 The ads are expected to run statewide for at least two weeks -- even after 
Tuesday's primary, portending a brutal campaign for the November election if 
Huffington wins the GOP nomination. 
</P>
<P>
 In a scene from the commercial, a simulated group of Huffington ad executives 
discuss the difficulty they've had in developing a campaign strategy for a 
flawed candidate facing a popular incumbent. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody said it was going to be easy to beat Feinstein with a Texas oil 
millionaire," one strategist offers. Finally, the leader of the meeting 
concludes: "Gentlemen, the only thing that will work is negative ads -- and 
lots of 'em." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's Willie Horton time again," says one of the officials. "Guess virtue is 
out this year," adds another. 
</P>
<P>
 The commercial raises the tax issue saying, "He avoided California taxes." 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein campaign manager Kam Kuwata said there are legitimate questions 
raised about Huffington's residency because Santa Barbara neighbors have told 
the Feinstein campaign that he was often in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 He said Huffington had a powerful financial incentive to keep a Houston 
residence because it allowed him to save as much as several hundred thousand 
dollars that would have been taxed in California and not in Texas. 
</P>
<P>
 The amount Huffington would have owed in California taxes cannot be determined 
because his salary from the family business and his profit from the company's 
sale are unknown. Huffington has declined to disclose his taxes or reveal his 
wealth. Estimates, however, indicate that the sale of the company generated 
about $600 million and that Huffington's fortune exceeds $70 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington said he and his wife, Arianna Stassinopolous Huffington, a 
best-selling author, filed separate tax returns. He said his wife paid 
California income taxes after she moved to the state in August, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is not one shred of evidence or truth that says I owed any taxes," 
Huffington said. 
</P>
<P>
 California state tax officials said they cannot comment directly on 
Huffington's case and declined to say whether they would act on Feinstein's 
complaint. But they said residency laws are vague and that the circumstances in 
Huffington's case -- a married couple filing separately with one living in 
another state -- is not by itself suspicious. 
</P>
<P>
 "If a person lives in Texas and their sole source of income is in Texas, we 
probably would not think twice about whether that person is from Texas" even 
with a spouse in California, said Jim Reber, spokesman for the state Franchise 
Tax Board. "Residency is probably one of the toughest and grayest areas of tax 
laws that exists. You are a resident of California if you are here for other 
than temporary or transitory purposes. That's it." 
</P>
<P>
 The location of family and employer are factors in determining residency, 
Reber said. But he also listed a number of other lifestyle indicators such as 
social ties, bank accounts, driver's license, voting registration and vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
 The California Department of Motor Vehicles confirmed that Huffington obtained 
his state driver's license in 1991. Voter registration records show a move to 
California the same year. 
</P>
<P>
 Dannemeyer on Tuesday issued a two-page list of questions for Huffington about 
his residency, his taxes and his personal wealth. 
</P>
<P>
 The former Orange County congressman said Huffington's wife was a campaign 
issue because she has represented her husband as a surrogate speaker and has 
been a member of a controversial New Age group led by John-Roger. Dannemeyer 
asked Huffington to disclose his wife's role in the "cult" and to defend 
allegations against the organization about misuse of money and about sexual 
activities. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington responded by saying: "Here's my comment for all of the things 
coming out this last week -- if a politician waits until the last week or 10 
days to release something, you can bet there's not much truth to it or they 
would have done it much sooner. This is what the people of California are sick 
of. I guarantee my campaign will not come out with an attack in the last 10 
days."

HILL DENIES GUILT IN CAPITOL PROBE; ETHICS: TAKING THE STAND AT HIS CORRUPTION 
TRIAL, SENATOR SAYS HE TOOK NO OFFICIAL ACTION IN EXCHANGE FOR THE $2,500 HE 
ACCEPTED IN AN FBI STING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK GLADSTONE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Describing himself as a law-and-order legislator, state Sen. Frank Hill 
testified Tuesday at his corruption trial that he did nothing illegal by 
accepting a $2,500 honorarium check from an undercover FBI agent posing as a 
Southern businessman. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if he exchanged official action for the money, Hill said, "No, I did 
not." 
</P>
<P>
 Hill, 40, said that in June, 1988, while he was an assemblyman, he walked to a 
hotel near the Capitol to meet the undercover agent to "develop a 
relationship." The agent was posing as a businessman seeking special-interest 
legislation to help a bogus shrimp operation locate near Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought we were going to get to know each other," said Hill, a Whittier 
Democrat, calmly testifying for the first time in his own defense. He is 
charged with three counts of extortion, conspiracy and money laundering. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill told the U.S. District Court jury that the $2,500 was "for upholding my 
end of the bargain . . . spending that time with him." He said that in 1988 it 
was not uncommon to receive an honorarium merely for touring a business plant 
or attending a reception. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill noted that he did not know how much he was going to receive until he 
looked at the check. "My policy is never to ask about the amount of the 
honorariums. I think it's inappropriate," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike campaign contributions, honorariums went directly into legislators' 
pockets. Although Hill testified that such honorariums were a common practice 
in 1988, they were outlawed by voters in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal prosecutors have maintained that Hill's activities reflected an 
atmosphere of almost unbridled fund raising in the Capitol. But in contrast, 
Hill downplayed the time spent on fund raising. He described his life as a 
legislator in almost textbook, civics lesson terms, recounting how he learned 
of voters' concerns at Little League games or the local carwash. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill's testimony was the highlight of the day and appeared to bolster his 
lawyers' efforts to impeach the credibility of Karin Watson, the prosecution's 
star witness. 
</P>
<P>
 Watson is a former Assembly Republican "super consultant" who pleaded guilty 
to extortion in exchange for a recommendation of a light sentence. In her 
version of the events, Hill was trading his best efforts to persuade then-Gov. 
George Deukmejian to sign the shrimp legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 Recalling that he had known Watson since the early 1980s, Hill described her 
as "bold and brassy." He testified that he never asked Watson to do fund 
raising on his behalf. Watson first enlisted his help on the shrimp bill in 
May, 1988, Hill said. 
</P>
<P>
 He contended that he did not know about the honorarium until a few days before 
he met with the undercover FBI agent. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill said he had not written a speech for the hotel meeting. Instead, he said, 
"I was prepared to follow the lead of the host and do whatever was necessary" 
during the hourlong meeting, which was seasoned with light banter about duck 
hunting and sports. Near the end, Hill received the $2,500 check from the FBI 
agent. 
</P>
<P>
 The next day, the undercover agent called Hill, offering to increase the 
honorarium. Hill turned him down, and testified that he was disturbed by the 
new offer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was shocked. . . . It was a startling comment that came out of the blue," 
Hill told the jury. As he was throughout most of his testimony, Hill's demeanor 
was easygoing. 
</P>
<P>
 Questioned by his lawyer, Stephen D. Miller of Los Angeles, about why he did 
not give the agent the brushoff, Hill said that as a politician he was not in 
the business of "slamming down the phone." 
</P>
<P>
 The FBI sting operation became public two months later when FBI agents raided 
the Capitol offices of legislators, including Hill and Assembly Republican 
Leader Pat Nolan. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill recalled being summoned from the Assembly chamber, believing the agents 
might be conducting a background check because he was considered a dark-horse 
candidate to be appointed state treasurer. To his surprise, Hill was questioned 
about the shrimp bill. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, Hill sought to distance himself from Nolan, who was originally 
indicted with him on corruption charges and later pleaded guilty. Nolan is 
serving a 33-month prison sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill, who was part of Nolan's inner circle, said the Glendale legislator could 
be gregarious and amiable or incredibly volatile. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would call him 'Mt. St. Pat' because he could erupt," Hill said, adding 
they were often at loggerheads over the direction of the Assembly Republican 
caucus. 
</P>
<P>
 With his wife and other family members in the courtroom, Hill painted a 
storybook picture of his legislative career. He started as a high school 
volunteer in the San Gabriel Valley, helping then-Assemblyman Bill Campbell, 
whom he succeeded in the Senate 20 years later. 
</P>
<P>
 His political career got another boost through a relationship with S. I. 
Hayakawa, who served as president of San Francisco State. Hill testified that 
he began corresponding with Hayakawa and later helped formulate strategy for 
the academician's underdog bid for U.S. Senate. When Hayakawa won, Hill joined 
his Washington staff. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill, a UCLA graduate, served as a congressional aide in the San Gabriel 
Valley before winning a seat in the Assembly in 1982. He was elected to the 
Senate in 1990. He said his ultimate goal is to earn a Ph.D and teach 
government at the college level. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill continues on the stand today.

ANOTHER TALE OF SEX, LIES AND BRITISH POLITICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM TUOHY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The British political scene was buzzing Tuesday with its latest scandal and 
its bewildering batch of elements. 
</P>
<P>
 Alan Clark, the 66-year-old patrician who once was a favored member of 
Margaret Thatcher's government, was accused of having overlapping affairs with 
the wife of a British judge and her two daughters. 
</P>
<P>
 Clark -- the son of the late Lord Clark, who was well-known in his role as the 
art historian who created the television series "Civilization" -- saw his own 
hopes of resuming his political career in the House of Lords dashed Tuesday 
because of the revelations. 
</P>
<P>
 In his best-selling "Diaries" last year, the younger Clark, who was a junior 
defense minister, produced fascinating insights into the workings of ministers 
in a Conservative government, while at the same time admitting to a career of 
pursuing women outside his marriage. His book included allusions to a "coven," 
an assembly of witches, among his women friends. He gave the first names or 
nicknames of three: the mother, Valerie, and her two daughters, Alison and 
Josephine. 
</P>
<P>
 It has now been revealed that Valerie is the wife of an English judge, James 
Harkess. After his retirement, the couple moved to South Africa. One of her 
daughters, Josephine, now 34, remains close to them in South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
 The other daughter, Alison, 36, is estranged and lives in homes with former 
KGB agent Sergei Kausov. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday, the top-selling tabloid, News of the World, owned by Rupert 
Murdoch, published a story by the women admitting to the affairs with Clark; 
the judge said he supported the allegations. The reason they spoke out, they 
said, was to "tell the truth, to set the record straight." 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel that certain people in the present government and the recent 
government are rotten to the core," Harkess said, "and I think this should be 
brought out." Harkess was reported to be politically opposed to Prime Minister 
John Major, a moderate Conservative by Harkess' standards. 
</P>
<P>
 Valerie Harkess said she realized after her 14-year affair with Clark, 
including a period when she knew her lover had had sex with her daughters, that 
he was a "pathetic, lecherous, dirty old man." 
</P>
<P>
 After the Harkess family landed in London on Tuesday, bankrolled by the News 
of the World, Clark admitted, "I deserved to be horsewhipped." But he denied 
allegations by the Harkesses that he had offered the family $150,000 to keep 
them from taking their story to the newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Jane Clark, the millionaire's wife, whom he married when she was 
17, told reporters she knew of her husband's infidelities, declaring, "Quite 
frankly, if you bed people I call 'below-stairs class,' they go to the papers, 
don't they?" 
</P>
<P>
 Jane Clark, 52, has admitted in the past to throwing an ax at her husband 
after being informed of his latest escapade. Of her husband's girlfriends, she 
said: "I think they are dreadful. They all have their 'sell-by' date on them. 
They all get put away on the shelf in the end."

<P>
 Fifty years after Allied forces landed in Normandy to drive Nazi troops from 
France, President Francois Mitterrand on Tuesday invited German soldiers to 
march in Paris on Bastille Day. 
</P>
<P>
 The German military contingent will be part of the European army corps that 
will parade in the city's July 14 celebration. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitterrand invited German Chancellor Helmut Kohl to attend the Bastille Day 
parade honoring the French Revolution at the end of a two-day summit in eastern 
France. The German leader had not been invited to celebrations marking the 50th 
anniversary of D-day. 
</P>
<P>
 It will be the first time German troops have marched on the Champs-Elysees 
since the Nazi occupation from 1940 to 1944.

CLINTON FLYING TO ITALY -- AND INTO EUROPEAN FEUD OVER NEO-FASCISTS; POLITICS: 
EU ALLIES ANGERED BY BERLUSCONI'S INCLUSION OF CONTROVERSIAL FIGURES IN 
CABINET. U.S. TAKES A WAIT-AND-SEE TACK. 
</P>

<P>
 Launching a nostalgic pilgrimage to salute the World War II victory over 
fascism, President Clinton flies today into a swirling, bitter European 
controversy with echoes from those desperate days half a century ago: Are the 
political heirs of Benito Mussolini trustworthy partners in a new Italian 
government? 
</P>
<P>
 Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, a billionaire businessman on the defensive 
over the inclusion of neo-fascists in his 2-week-old government, pledged anew 
Tuesday that there is no threat to democracy. 
</P>
<P>
 Berlusconi reassured a delegation from the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los 
Angeles that he would support their call for the extradition from Argentina of 
Nazi war criminal Erich Priebke. 
</P>
<P>
 "Berlusconi said he was personally committed to see Priebke brought to trial 
in Rome," said Rabbi Abraham Cooper, associate dean of the center and head of 
the delegation. "I spoke directly about concerns over neo-fascists in 
government, and I was very satisfied with Berlusconi's responses." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton arrives about midnight for his first visit to Rome, a 
planned-to-the-minute extravaganza that will include talks Thursday with 
Berlusconi and a meeting with Pope John Paul II. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, the President delivers a major address at the U.S. military 
cemetery in Nettuno south of Rome. Clinton will honor soldiers who died in 
fighting after the 1944 amphibious landing at Anzio, one of the savage battles 
that marked the beginning of the end of World War II. On Saturday, the 50th 
anniversary of the liberation of Rome, Clinton flies to England and continues 
to France for D-day ceremonies on Normandy beaches Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 In assaying the new-look government of one of its closest allies, the United 
States has proved more sanguine about the five neo-fascist members of 
Berlusconi's Cabinet than Italy's partners in the European Union. 
</P>
<P>
 "Berlusconi has been elected. Let's see if he knows how to do his job. Let's 
give him a chance and support him," Clinton told Italian reporters in 
Washington in an interview televised here over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 The 57-year-old self-made tycoon entered politics in January, led a right-wing 
electoral alliance to victory in March and won confirmation by Parliament in 
mid-May. Since then, however, Berlusconi has been repeatedly rebuffed by 
European partners for the neo-fascist elements in his coalition, and frustrated 
by allies at home in his efforts to effectively launch Italy's first right-wing 
government since the war. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, in the latest incident, Socialist members of the European 
Parliament asked conservative colleagues to help bar neo-fascists from joining 
the assembly after European elections later this month. 
</P>
<P>
 In Brussels on Monday, Elio di Rupo, the Belgian vice premier and 
telecommunications minister and the son of Italian immigrants, refused to shake 
hands with his Italian counterpart, neo-fascist Giuseppe Tatarella, who was 
making his first visit. So did the Danish telecommunications minister. 
</P>
<P>
 Berlusconi was attacked by Italian commentators after reportedly telling an 
interviewer that Mussolini, who invented fascism and ruled Italy as dictator 
for two decades, had done some good things. The thin-skinned Italian prime 
minister now says he was misquoted. 
</P>
<P>
 Returned to office after more than four decades as pariahs, extremists among 
the neo-fascists are in full cry -- to the embarrassment of Berlusconi and 
Gianfranco Fini, the leader of the neo-fascist coalition member National 
Alliance. 
</P>
<P>
 One neo-fascist member of Parliament is demanding veterans benefits for 
soldiers who fought for the rump republic that Mussolini formed in northern 
Italy after his overthrow in 1943. Another wants a constitutional prohibition 
against fascism lifted. 
</P>
<P>
 To Berlusconi's distress, the shrill few have been louder than the 
quiet-spoken majority. 
</P>
<P>
 "The National Alliance condemns any totalitarianism and certainly does not 
propose a model for a totalitarian or despotic state," Fini told state radio 
over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 Fini, a slick, 42-year-old professional politician, has made neo-fascism 
politically acceptable. But he also triggered a storm after the election by 
declaring that Mussolini was the century's greatest statesman. He says he was 
quoted out of context. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of Berlusconi's ministers are more technocrat than politician, and in the 
economic and international arenas they are well-respected. Foreign Minister 
Antonio Martino, a university professor, won high marks on confidence-building 
visits to Washington and Brussels. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sure there will be no difficulty in collaboration between Britain and 
Italy," British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd said after meeting Martino in 
Brussels. 
</P>
<P>
 Berlusconi -- who promises a jobs-producing, more efficient government that is 
based on free-market economics and is able to pay its bills -- asks to be 
evaluated "on the basis of facts and not on prejudices." 
</P>
<P>
 That was an appeal he made again Tuesday in conversation with the Wiesenthal 
Center delegation, which has been pressing for vigorous Italian action to bring 
Priebke to trial. The former SS captain has confessed to being second in 
command of German soldiers who executed 335 Italian civilians, about 75 of them 
Jews, at the Ardeatine Caves south of Rome in 1944.

TRENDS; IN THE FUTURE, LEISURE TIME MAY BE A THING OF THE PAST; WILL THE NEW 
TECHNOLOGY REVOLUTION KEEP US FROM HAVING FUN? THE EXPERTS THINK SO, SINCE WE 
ALREADY HAVE TROUBLE JUST DOING NOTHING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Utopian writer Edward Bellamy put it this way: "If bread is the first 
necessity of life, recreation is a close second." 
</P>
<P>
 That was a century ago. Since then, through the cycle of the Industrial 
Revolution with all its gilded promises of machines to save us time and work, 
Americans remain uneasy with play. We yearn for it, fret about it and throw our 
money in quest of it. But we don't regard it seriously. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a very contradictory part of America," says John R. Kelly, professor of 
sociology and leisure studies at the University of Illinois. "There is 
increased emphasis in people's lives on what we call leisure. Still, in the 
social ideology is the concept that if something is not productive, it's not 
important." 
</P>
<P>
 Now the nation crosses the threshold of a new Information and Technology 
Revolution. And it appears Americans once again are beguiled by the promise of 
machines. These new electronic devices will make us smarter, bring to our 
fingertips the wonders of the world and worlds beyond, entertain us and delight 
us. 
</P>
<P>
 If you follow the breathless promotions closely, you might even arrive at a 
neo-utopian vision wherein technology can erase the distinction between work 
and play, so we won't have to feel guilty about leisure any more. 
</P>
<P>
 One machine will do it all -- we will earn our livelihoods from it, play on 
it, learn, organize ourselves, establish friendships, let it entertain us, and 
have the unheard of mobility to do all of this while we roam the countryside on 
our own schedules. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, we will be in charge of our lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Not buying this promise are some of those who study leisure as a necessary 
component to human balance and satisfaction. These thinkers offer at least two 
contrasting expressions of skepticism about tomorrow's technology. 
</P>
<P>
 Kelly subscribes to the "big mirage theory." That is, technology is 
evolutionary and not revolutionary; it may alter how we do things, but not what 
we do. 
</P>
<P>
 "Vastly overblown," Kelly says about foretold changes in American life. The 
huge costs of technology, its inherent complexity and longstanding patterns of 
cultural behavior will naturally, and significantly, modulate the process of 
social transformation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Technology doesn't change things very much in the small worlds in which 
people live. Most people still live in families, they eat dinner, go on 
vacation. Change will have to fit in with that," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 So, a 12-year-old obsessively playing with dolls or toy soldiers in 1950 is 
not so much different from today's youngsters fixated on their beeping Game 
Boys. 
</P>
<P>
 A more disturbing view comes from other scholars. 
</P>
<P>
 As they see it, technology is rapidly separating us from the natural world, 
blurring the distinctions between what is real and what is not, substituting 
vicarious stimulation for actual experience, and giving us no leisure relief 
from the relentless acceleration of time. 
</P>
<P>
 The ballyhooed coming of virtual reality is particularly unsettling to these 
experts. As envisioned, these machines will simulate places and experiences 
without requiring physical effort or skill, for instance deep sea diving 
without getting wet. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our definition of mental illness and sanity is the ability to distinguish 
between what is real and what is not," says Geoffrey Godby, professor of 
leisure studies at Penn State. 
</P>
<P>
 "People already are yearning for what is real. Why else would a highly sugared 
nut beverage be marketed as 'the real thing?' . . . Leisure is giving oneself 
to an act, not taking something from it. And technology is no friend of that." 
</P>
<P>
 At Cal State Northridge, Al Wright, professor of leisure studies, says he is 
staggered, overwhelmed and depressed at how little students know of the real 
world around them. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, urban youth have seen so many images of rivers that real rivers 
hold no mystery. "Then I take them out to a river, and they say, 'Oh my gosh, I 
didn't know this is what a river sounds like.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Wright fears that Americans will accept simulated experience and never know 
what they are missing. "And it won't result in the same benefit," he adds. 
</P>
<P>
 Virtually all experts in the field say that Americans undervalue leisure -- 
even in the face of overwhelming data that show that well-rounded individuals 
live longer and happier. Rather than trying to intermingle work and play, these 
scholars say Americans need more thoughtful emphasis on leisure apart from 
toil. 
</P>
<P>
 How important is it? "I'll answer that with a question," says Brett Wright, a 
professor of recreation at George Mason University. "How important is it to 
sleep? To eat? To breathe? We can't continue to rob ourselves of it. We can't 
sustain our lives without it. Psychologically, we're beginning to reach that 
point." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the most important ingredient of leisure is the release from the 
pressure of time. And in this regard, even the most enthusiastic futurists 
offer little consolation. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than measure time by the seasons as their ancestors did, Americans now 
rush to upgrade their IBM 286 computers for the faster 486, compressing time 
into ever quickening bursts. This, despite their lament, expressed in poll 
after poll, that society is too fast-paced already. 
</P>
<P>
 Says Godby: "Efficiency is the most important value in American life. We are 
becoming ever more efficient, at the resultant death of tranquillity. Whatever 
happened to tranquillity anyway?" Where Does the Time Go? 
</P>
<P>
 How we spend our time is an eternal fascination. Jim Spring of the research 
organization Leisure Trends published his work in a 1993 issue of American 
Demographics. Among them: 
</P>
<P>
 * Americans have about 41 duty-free hours each week, when they are not 
sleeping, working, keeping house or personal care. 
</P>
<P>
 * TV viewing consumes one-third of our free time during the week, and 
one-quarter during weekends. 
</P>
<P>
 Top Activities 
</P>
<P>
 1) TV 
</P>
<P>
 2) Socializing 
</P>
<P>
 3) Reading 
</P>
<P>
 * Monday is the day Americans spend the highest proportion of their time 
working in their gardens. Thursday is the day they perfer home computers. 
</P>
<P>
 * Americans say they enjoy sex more than anything else. But they spend only an 
average of 22 minutes a week making love -- less time overall than they spend 
financial planning. 
</P>
<P>
 Too Busy to Have Fun? 
</P>
<P>
 The University of Georgia offers advice on enjoying your free time. 
</P>
<P>
 1. Use restraint in work and at home to develop a slower pace. 
</P>
<P>
 2. Resist the pressure to use time as efficiently -- and as quickly -- as 
possible. 
</P>
<P>
 3. Choose activities carefully. Resist the idea of accumulating experience in 
the same way that you resist the idea of accumulating goods. 
</P>
<P>
 5. Choose activities in which you can become completely absorbed, where time 
becomes irrelevant and the quality of the moment is most important.

SENATORS SEEK TO SHIFT RUSSIAN-AMERICAN MILITARY EXERCISES FROM URALS TO THE 
U.S.; DIPLOMACY: COMMUNISTS AND NATIONALISTS HAD OPPOSED THE ARRIVAL OF 250 
'YANKEE' TROOPS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SONNI EFRON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A delegation of U.S. senators Tuesday sought to defuse anti-American sentiment 
by proposing that joint military exercises, which were to be conducted in 
Russia, take place instead on U.S. soil. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States and Russia agreed in September to the maneuvers, with both 
governments billing the exercise as a dry run for possible future peacekeeping 
operations. The drill was to take place in July at the Totsk testing ground in 
the Ural Mountains. Its significance was to be more symbolic than military, 
because the entire operation was to involve only 250 soldiers from each side, 
no heavy equipment and no live fire. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Communists and nationalists here had seized on the notion of "Yankee" 
soldiers on Russian territory as further evidence of what they see as a 
continued attempt by the United States to impose its will on a weakened Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 "Russia cannot be made a training ground for the American Army," lawmaker 
Pyotr P. Shirshov, an army officer from Bryansk, said in a heated debate last 
month. 
</P>
<P>
 Faced with stiff opposition in Parliament and in the Urals, the Russian 
government quietly asked the United States on Friday to postpone the exercises. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday, a bipartisan delegation from the U.S. Senate Armed Services 
Committee arrived to learn that the maneuvers, meant to showcase the new 
cooperation between the old adversaries, had instead fallen victim to resurgent 
Russian nationalism. 
</P>
<P>
 Some conservative Russians interpreted the American push for the exercises as 
" 'We won the Cold War and now we're going to show you our stuff' -- which is 
not at all what it was meant to be," said Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-Tex.). 
</P>
<P>
 Given the "sensitivity" of the issue, committee Chairman Sen. Sam Nunn 
(D.-Ga.) said the seven senators visiting here will recommend to President 
Clinton and Defense Secretary William J. Perry that the planned U.S.-Russian 
maneuvers be held in America. 
</P>
<P>
 Nunn suggested that the National Training Center at Ft. Irwin in California -- 
or several bases in his home state of Georgia -- might be just right for the 
job. Hutchison said she is sure Texas would be pleased to host the exercises. 
</P>
<P>
 Russian politicians welcomed the U.S. proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 "All these hysterics about the exercises in the Totsk firing range are simply 
comical," said liberal economist Yegor T. Gaidar, complaining that hard-liners 
have told people that U.S. troops would use the opportunity to seize Moscow. 
"Nevertheless, the opposition managed to use this as a pretext for violent 
anti-Western propaganda." 
</P>
<P>
 Gaidar called the Nunn proposal "reasonable and useful -- because the most 
frequently repeated argument was, 'See, they are not inviting us to have the 
exercise in the States, are they?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, the United States and Russia first agreed to hold the maneuvers in 
Germany. But officials had neglected to consult the German government, which 
nixed the idea. Next, the United States proposed hosting the exercises, but 
Russia balked at the $2-million price. 
</P>
<P>
 Sergei N. Yushenkov, chairman of the Defense Committee of the Duma, or lower 
house of the Russian Parliament, said the maneuvers' cost could still be a 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
 And he said that members of the far-right party led by Vladimir V. Zhirinovsky 
-- who had insisted that the exercises not be held in Russia -- were already 
finding new excuses Tuesday to oppose holding them in the United States. 
Zhirinovsky supporters have formed an alliance with other nationalists, 
Communists and conservative Agrarian lawmakers. They often command a Duma 
majority. 
</P>
<P>
 "They do not want equal partnership (with the West), and they are not really 
interested in promoting a stable, firm and reliable international security 
system," Yushenkov said of the hard-line opposition. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, there are signs that Russian lawmakers elected in December 
are serious about making the new Parliament work. The U.S. senators were 
invited to Moscow by Duma Speaker Ivan P. Rybkin, who wanted the Senate 
committee to explain to Russian lawmakers how the U.S. Congress oversees the 
military budget. 
</P>
<P>
 Yushenkov said the Defense Committee wants to exert the same level of civilian 
control over the Russian military as the U.S. Congress exercises over its armed 
forces -- a statement that impressed the U.S. lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
 While they met with a range of Russian politicians -- including Zhirinovsky 
backers -- the senators did not request a meeting with President Boris N. 
Yeltsin. 
</P>
<P>
 In Soviet times, visiting lawmakers always had token meetings with the Supreme 
Soviet, the puppet legislature, then held more substantive meetings with the 
real rulers. "We didn't want to give the impression that our meetings with the 
Duma were perfunctory," Sen. Dan Coats (R-Ind.) said. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. lawmakers used their visit to discuss the chaotic, punitive Russian 
tax system, which discourages foreign investment. Russian lawmakers, meanwhile, 
complained about U.S. efforts to prevent Russian weapons sales to other 
countries, contending that the United States is acting simply to block 
competition in the lucrative world arms market. 
</P>
<P>
 Nunn also stressed the need for U.S. and Russian lawmakers to take a more 
active role in overseeing the dismantling and destruction of nuclear, chemical 
and biological weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 The Georgia senator said he is "frustrated" by bureaucratic delays in 
distributing the $1 billion that Congress has appropriated to help Russia, 
Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Belarus do away with their weapons of mass destruction. 
He said he had been assured the money will begin flowing soon. 
</P>
<P>
 Nunn said there are no documented cases of Russian organized crime groups 
stealing or selling materiel from the old Soviet arsenal but said that such a 
threat exists.

U.S. OFFICIALS WEIGH N. KOREAN SANCTIONS; NUCLEAR ARMS: NORTH'S RAPID REMOVAL 
OF FUEL RODS FOCUSES ATTENTION ON POSSIBLE U.N. CURBS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 President Clinton and his top national security officials met Tuesday to 
consider the potentially volatile question of whether to seek economic 
sanctions against North Korea -- a move that Pyongyang has warned would be 
regarded as an act of war. 
</P>
<P>
 Although no final decisions were expected Tuesday, officials said Clinton 
wanted a consensus for any future actions by tonight, when he is scheduled to 
leave for Europe to help celebrate the 50th anniversary of D-day. 
</P>
<P>
 The flurry of activity came amid growing fears that North Korea may be 
removing spent fuel rods from its reactor so rapidly that it is on the verge of 
destroying U.N. inspectors' ability to determine if reprocessed spent fuel has 
been diverted to make nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration has warned that it considers the ability of the U.N. 
inspectors to trace the history of North Korea's nuclear program a crucial 
issue in the dispute. 
</P>
<P>
 The situation has been intensifying for days. In a last-ditch effort to avert 
a crisis, the U.N. Security Council on Monday urged North Korea to preserve all 
existing evidence of possible diversions of nuclear fuel. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.N.-affiliated International Atomic Energy Agency, which conducts the 
nuclear inspections, is expected to issue a report this week declaring whether 
North Korea has destroyed the agency's ability to tell if Pyongyang has started 
the process of making nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials say that if the IAEA reports its efforts have been blocked, 
there is little doubt the Security Council will begin considering sanctions. 
The question then would be how broad the measures should be and how rapidly 
they should be imposed. 
</P>
<P>
 South Korea said Tuesday that North Korea already has removed more than 4,800 
of 8,000 spent fuel rods in the reactor at Yongbyon -- a far more rapid pace 
than Western analysts had expected. Officials say that at this rate, it could 
be only days before the evidence is destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration continued to express alarm publicly. "We're very concerned 
about the situation," White House Press Secretary Dee Dee Myers told reporters. 
But she said Washington still hopes for a diplomatic solution. 
</P>
<P>
 A major problem facing the Administration is uncertainty whether China, which 
supported Monday's U.N. appeal, would go along with any move to impose formal 
sanctions. China wants Washington to include negotiations about nuclear issues 
in broader U.S.-North Korean talks. 
</P>
<P>
 Pentagon officials said Tuesday that any decision to push for sanctions almost 
certainly would be accompanied by a step-up in the alert status of U.S. 
military forces in the region. North Korea repeatedly has warned that 
imposition of sanctions would be regarded as an act of war. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense Secretary William J. Perry has sent Patriot missiles to South Korea to 
strengthen allied defenses there and has ordered extra supplies of aircraft 
parts and ammunition in case the North launches a retaliatory attack. 
</P>
<P>
 In Vienna, North Korean officials continued to rebuff IAEA demands that 
inspectors be permitted to test the rods that have been removed. Yun Ho Jin, 
Pyongyang's representative to the agency, said his government would not alter 
its policies any time soon, but he said that it would set aside 40 of the spent 
fuel rods for possible inspection by the IAEA later. Analysts said the move 
would be useless. 
</P>
<P>
 Intelligence reports from Japan also have suggested that North Korea may be 
preparing to test a new medium-range missile over the Sea of Japan -- a step 
that could further intensify its confrontation with the West. 
</P>
<P>
 Myers said Tuesday that Clinton had spoken by telephone late Monday with South 
Korean President Kim Young Sam and the two had reaffirmed their support for 
Monday's Security Council statement.

ISRAELIS KILL 2 PALESTINIANS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Israeli security forces shot and killed two fugitive Palestinians Tuesday as 
the two men got off a bus in a West Bank town near Jerusalem, bystanders said. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents of Al Ram took to the streets in protest, and soldiers fired tear 
gas to disperse the crowds. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses said Israeli security forces posed as vegetable vendors in a van 
near a bus stop. When the bus stopped, the security forces asked two young 
Palestinians to step forward. Then, without warning, the troops started 
shooting, the witnesses said. 
</P>
<P>
 Army officials confirmed the shootings but declined comment on whether the 
Palestinians, both members of the radical Hamas group, were shot without 
warning. 
</P>
<P>
 Adel abu Sneneh, 34, said he saw five Israelis get out of the Ford and two 
shot at the Palestinians. He said that after the two Palestinians fell the 
Israelis kept shooting. Sneneh said a soldier put a gun next to one body and 
photographed it.

FISHING VIDEO OPENS A CAN OF WORMS; POLITICS: SEN. HAYDEN REVEALS TAPE OF FISH 
AND GAME OFFICIALS ON OUTING WITH ATTORNEY SEEKING CHANGES IN LAW. DEPARTMENT 
SPOKESMAN SAYS NO STATE BUSINESS WAS DISCUSSED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Playing private detective for a day, state Sen. Tom Hayden's staff captured 
Gov. Pete Wilson's director of fish and game and one of his top deputies on 
videotape as they fished during business hours last week with a lawyer who is 
trying to loosen the state's endangered species protection laws. 
</P>
<P>
 To Hayden, the American River fishing excursion -- which featured two canoes, 
some sandwiches and soft drinks -- was a serious example of the Wilson 
Administration's cozy relationship with those they are supposed to be 
regulating. 
</P>
<P>
 State officials say that no business was discussed, that the anglers caught 
six shad in a little more than six hours, and that the whole affair is much ado 
about nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 Hayden, the Santa Monica Democrat who is running for governor, has made 
government ethics and reform the centerpiece of his campaign and has focused on 
the issue as a legislator. 
</P>
<P>
 When a whistle-blower tipped him off about the fishing trip, Hayden sent a 
staff member with a video camera to record the outing, which took place Friday 
afternoon before the Memorial Day weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 Fish and Game Director Boyd Gibbons and his chief department lawyer, Craig 
Manson, went on the trip at the invitation of Sacramento lawyer George 
Kammerer, who represents development companies that are trying to overhaul the 
California Endangered Species Act. 
</P>
<P>
 Kammerer offered the invitation in a letter to Gibbons in which the lawyer 
described the event as the "Second Annual Yuba River Shad Addicts Fishing and 
Policy Planning Conference." 
</P>
<P>
 The men fished on a stretch of the American River about 20 minutes by car from 
the state Capitol. Also with them was Randy Collins, vice president of a 
Sacramento property management and development firm. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is very serious," Hayden said at a news conference at which he played 
the five-minute tape. "This kind of closeness or clubbiness with lobbyists 
ought to end." 
</P>
<P>
 He sent Wilson a letter asking the governor to ban socializing during business 
hours or personal time between state officials and representatives of 
industries they oversee. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant Resources Secretary Andrew McCleod attended Hayden's presentation 
and afterward said it was pathetic, specious and a cynical campaign ploy. He 
said Gibbons and Manson were on personal time and noted that Kammerer, although 
he represents industry as a lawyer, is not a lobbyist. 
</P>
<P>
 McCleod said the Administration supports legislation that would make it easier 
for the state to draft compromises with private landowners that protect the 
habitat of endangered species while allowing some development to proceed. He 
said Wilson opposes a competing bill that Kammerer drafted for the County 
Supervisors Assn. of California. 
</P>
<P>
 "No conversations took place on the river about the legislation," McCleod 
said. "This was not improper." 
</P>
<P>
 Kammerer could not be reached for comment.

NAVY CHIEF REPORTEDLY CONFIRMS HARASSMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Navy Secretary John H. Dalton has told a female lieutenant she was mistreated 
by her superior officer and has censured the man, a senior Navy official said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Dalton, who wrote Lt. Darlene Simmons several weeks ago, also moved to expunge 
negative portions of her personnel record that had resulted from the sexual 
harassment, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
 Simmons, a legal officer, testified before Congress that her complaints of 
sexual harassment from her superior had resulted in more.

WHITE HOUSE AIRS RECORD OF HELICOPTER TRIPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL RICHTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hoping to calm an uproar over questionable use of presidential helicopters, 
the White House disclosed Tuesday that aides have taken 12 trips using the 
aircraft, but officials said none involved misuse of the flights. 
</P>
<P>
 The disclosure came as an official who was forced to resign last week for 
using one of the choppers for a golf outing said he alone -- not top White 
House aides -- will cover the $13,129 cost of the trip. 
</P>
<P>
 Thirteen White House aides agreed Friday to put up money to reimburse the 
government for the trip by former White House administrative chief David 
Watkins and two other aides. 
</P>
<P>
 But Watkins said in an interview that he changed his mind Sunday after reading 
news accounts that quoted former colleagues at the White House who were angered 
by the obligations he had forced on them. Watkins said the $13,129 cost of the 
trip was far more than the $2,500 to $3,000 he was told the trip would cost. 
</P>
<P>
 "I did not want to create any financial burden for anyone, or create any ill 
will toward me," said Watkins, a millionaire businessman who worked for Clinton 
on his campaigns or as an aide for longer than a decade. 
</P>
<P>
 In detailing other trips on presidential helicopters, the White House released 
a memo briefly describing the flights, which took place from April 29, 1993, to 
May 24, 1994. Officials said the flights, which excluded presidential and 
military journeys, showed no misuse of the sophisticated aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
 But congressional Republicans who have pressed for a full accounting of the 
trips said the description did not provide sufficient detail. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is just an outline," said Cheri Jacobus, an aide to Rep. Roscoe G. 
Bartlett (R-Md.). "The White House's information has been inconsistent, 
sporadic and incorrect. We want to know more." 
</P>
<P>
 Bartlett and half a dozen others have been demanding more information since it 
was disclosed that the three White House officials used one of the 
$2,380-an-hour helicopters to go golfing last Tuesday at the Holly Hills 
Country Club near New Market, Md. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, White House Chief of Staff Thomas (Mack) McLarty released a memo 
saying that from now on, the staff chief or his deputy must approve flights. In 
their absence, approvals can come from officials of the White House counsel's 
office but no longer, as before, from the chief of administration. 
</P>
<P>
 Watkins, in the interview, insisted that his golfing trip was justified as 
part of his duties to examine recreational opportunities for Clinton at Camp 
David and in the area nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 Concerning golf courses, he said: "I think I'm the most knowledgeable person 
in the White House . . . or at least the most passionate golfer -- next to the 
President." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite Clinton's earlier statements to a news conference that he was "very 
angry" about the infraction, Watkins said the President was "very sorrowful" 
and "very supportive" in their last meeting, in the Oval Office. Indeed, 
Watkins has told friends that the two old Arkansas friends cried in their 
parting meeting.

TRIAL OPENS FOR PARENTS OF BABY IN RAT ATTACK; COURTS: THE ATTORNEY FOR THE 
HOMELESS COUPLE, WHO FACE UP TO SIX YEARS IN PRISON IF CONVICTED OF INVOLUNTARY 
MANSLAUGHTER, SAYS THE INFANT WAS BITTEN AFTER HE DIED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 As a manslaughter trial began Tuesday for a homeless couple whose starving pet 
rat attacked their infant son, a defense attorney told jurors the baby already 
was dead when the rodent began eating him. 
</P>
<P>
 Steven and Kathyleen Giguere face up to six years in prison if convicted of 
involuntary manslaughter and child endangerment charges from the death last 
August of their son, Steven Jr. The 4-month-old was bitten more than 100 times 
in the station wagon where the family slept. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Jim Tanizaki told jurors the boy's parents had left him 
alone in the car when the rat's sharp teeth struck an artery, causing the baby 
to bleed to death. But defense attorney Salvatore Ciulla said a congenital 
breathing disorder or Sudden Infant Death Syndrome may be to blame. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not a case where a rat killed a baby," said Ciulla, who represents 
Steven Giguere. 
</P>
<P>
 Jurors must decide whether the Gigueres were criminally negligent parents who 
knew from past experience that the pet rat named Homer was prone to biting 
people, or whether their child fell victim to a freak accident. 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecution's first two witnesses depicted the Gigueres as neglectful 
parents who lived in filthy, roach-infested surroundings where liquor cans and 
bottles, spoiled food, rat droppings and soiled diapers were strewn everywhere. 
 
</P>
<P>
 "The defendants didn't care about the living conditions of their children," 
Tanizaki told jurors. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple lived on welfare and food stamps and begged for money. They moved 
to their car after being evicted from an Anaheim apartment, the witnesses 
testified. 
</P>
<P>
 But Orange County Superior Court Judge Kazuharu Makino has barred the 
prosecution from introducing evidence that the couple also used drugs. When the 
second witness blurted out that Kathyleen Giguere used drugs during her 
pregnancy, it nearly caused a mistrial and the judge ordered jurors to 
disregard that portion of the testimony. 
</P>
<P>
 Tanizaki said outside of court that the judge's ruling bars him from 
discussing whether blood tests show the Gigueres used drugs the night of the 
rat attack. Steven Giguere, 28, has prior convictions for drunken driving and 
possession of marijuana. 
</P>
<P>
 The case has focused attention on the care of neglected children. County 
social service officials had received numerous complaints about the welfare of 
the Giguere children, including a complaint from Steven Giguere Sr.'s parents 
just 48 hours before the death. 
</P>
<P>
 But officials never had enough evidence to take the children away and were 
unable to find the transient couple to investigate the final complaint before 
it was too late. The Giguere's 4-year-old daughter now lives with her 
grandparents. 
</P>
<P>
 Kathyleen Giguere, 31, also has a daughter in foster care in Los Angeles 
County. 
</P>
<P>
 Tanizaki told jurors that shortly before the boy died, Kathyleen Giguere was 
standing outside the car and refused to tend to the boy as he lay crying, and 
instead repeatedly yelled "shut up" at him. 
</P>
<P>
 The rat measured 12 inches from nose to tail. A necropsy showed it was 
starving and dehydrated when it turned on the infant. 
</P>
<P>
 "The evidence will show -- and I'm sorry for saying this -- it found its food 
source," said Tanizaki, who said the rat's stomach contents included the boy's 
flesh and blood.

2 INJURED IN PLANE CRASH; PILOT AND PASSENGER BURNED, LISTED IN CRITICAL 
CONDITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A pilot and his passenger were critically injured Tuesday morning when their 
private airplane crashed and caught fire shortly after takeoff from Fullerton 
Municipal Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 Eyewitnesses said the single-engine Beechcraft Bonanza BE-36 appeared to be 
losing power shortly before crashing beside the Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe 
railroad tracks about 300 feet east of Gilbert Street. 
</P>
<P>
 No one on the ground was injured in the crash, which occurred about 8:45 a.m. 
in an industrial area about a mile east of the airport, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I heard the plane sputter, then all of a sudden it was at a 45-degree angle," 
said Manny Sanchez, who was the first person to reach the crash site. "I saw it 
clip a light pole, make a big turn in the air, then hit the ground and burst 
into flames." 
</P>
<P>
 Sanchez, who was stopped at a traffic light on Gilbert Street, quickly drove 
to the scene in the 1900 block of Raymer Avenue. As he got out of his truck, he 
saw one of the victims running out of the plane in flames. 
</P>
<P>
 "I grabbed him and I ripped off some of his burning clothes," Sanchez said. 
"Then I ran toward the other guy and started ripping his burning clothes off, 
too." 
</P>
<P>
 The injured men, pilot Tony Gale Dunivant, 40, and passenger Juan Sanchez, 30, 
were the only occupants in the four-seat plane, which had just embarked on what 
was to be a nonstop flight to Laredo, Tex., airport officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dunivant, a resident of Laredo, was in critical condition Friday at UCI 
Medical Center in Orange. He suffered second and third-degree burns over 80% of 
his body, hospital spokeswoman Fran Tardiff said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanchez, a resident of El Paso, Tex., suffered second-degree burns over half 
of his body and third-degree burns on his hands. He was in the same hospital in 
critical condition, Tardiff said. 
</P>
<P>
 The plane was registered in Laredo and landed in Fullerton on Saturday. It 
remained parked at the airport until Tuesday morning, when it took off at 8:44 
a.m., said Airport Director Roland Elder. 
</P>
<P>
 Elder said the airport's communications tower did not receive any indication 
from the pilot that he was having trouble. The crash is being investigated by 
the National Transportation Safety Board, which released no information 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It appears that the pilot was trying to maneuver the plane, judging from the 
position it is in on the ground," Elder said at the crash site. "It appears 
that he had it somewhat under control until the point of impact. If the 
airplane hadn't caught on fire, they might have walked away from it." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The airport's 61-year-old maintenance supervisor, Charlie Ferranti, was out on 
the runway repairing an arrow light box when he looked up and noticed the small 
plane "wobbling in the air." 
</P>
<P>
 "I immediately notified the tower and said, 'Someone's going down!' " said 
Ferranti, who immediately jumped into a truck along with airport employee Rudy 
Padilla and headed toward where he thought the plane might land. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was the worst thing I have ever seen," said Padilla, who began working at 
the airport two months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Several employees at Classic Metal Works, a nearby auto repair shop, saw the 
plane go down. They vaulted over a chain-link fence and ran to the scene. 
</P>
<P>
 Employee Ron Davis said he tried to comfort the victims. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the guys looked up at me and asked, 'Am I really bad?' " said Davis, 
27. "I told him he was going to be OK. I said, 'You're alive and that's all 
that matters.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses said that one of the victims, unaware that the other man had also 
escaped, kept screaming that his friend was still inside. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tried to break the windows of the plane by throwing rocks," said Davis. 
"Then we saw the other guy and realized that they had both got out." 
</P>
<P>
 Davis' co-worker Anthony Robles arrived at the scene with a fire extinguisher. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was kind of in shock because I had never seen anything like that before," 
said Robles, 29. "Those planes fly over every day in every direction. I was 
just wondering if one was ever going to go down." 
</P>
<P>
 The wreckage of the plane was strewn along Raymer Avenue, which runs parallel 
to the railroad tracks. The plane's right wing was completely torn off, and the 
25-foot-high cement pole that the plane had struck was knocked to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 The plane spun on its belly and stopped about 50 feet from where it had hit 
the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 Elder said the pilot was following the airport's voluntary "preferred safety 
plan" by taking off over the railroad tracks to avoid housing and to cut down 
on the amount of noise to area residents. 
</P>
<P>
 "The plan is to follow the railroad tracks if you are in trouble so there is 
less of a chance of hitting anything," Elder said. "It is the route we 
suggest." 
</P>
<P>
 There have been 22 crashes at or near Fullerton Municipal Airport since 1985, 
killing five people and injuring 10, all aboard planes. The airport opened in 
1927. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The last crash to occur near the airport was in December, 1992, when a 
single-engine plane crash-landed about a minute after takeoff. 
</P>
<P>
 That crash was the third within a two-month period near the airport, which is 
just inside the northwest corner of Fullerton next to Buena Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Those crash-landings led then-Buena Park Mayor Rhonda J. McCune, in whose city 
two of the 1992 crashes had occurred, to suggest that the airport be closed, or 
that takeoffs and landings over Buena Park be banned at the least. 
</P>
<P>
 Elder, however, has steadfastly defended the airport's safety record, and said 
no one on the ground has ever been injured or killed in a Fullerton 
Airport-related crash.

PARKS MEASURE WOULD FUND COUNTY PROJECTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Orange County would receive at least $118 million to buy open space, improve 
parks and fund cultural projects if voters on Tuesday pass Proposition 180, a 
statewide parks initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 The $2-billion California Parks and Wildlife Initiative, known as CALPAW, on 
the ballot would directly allocate funds to the county and 31 local cities for 
various projects.  
</P>
<P>
 Also, the county could compete for another $213 million in statewide grants 
made available under the proposition. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the single most important environmental initiative in this decade for 
the state of California," said Leslie Robinson of Newport Beach, the 
initiative's county coordinator. "If we don't get it, several projects that 
have been set aside for years as open space areas will be developed." 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the major Orange County projects targeted for funding under 
Proposition 180 are: 
</P>
<P>
 * $25 million for the purchase of 2,150-acre Laguna Laurel in Laguna Canyon to 
complete a 15,000-acre greenbelt. 
</P>
<P>
 * $14 million to buy open space and natural lands in the foothills of the 
Santa Ana Mountains, including property in the Silverado, Trabuco, Verdugo and 
Santiago canyons. 
</P>
<P>
 * $12 million for coastal ridgelines and hillsides that would be included in 
the Aliso/Wood Canyons Regional Park. 
</P>
<P>
 * $5 million to buy an undetermined portion of the 77-acre site next to the 
Upper Newport Bay Ecological Reserve. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 180's supporters include a coalition of environmental 
organizations from the heavyweight Audubon Society and Sierra Club, down to 
such local groups as the Laguna Canyon Foundation and the 12-member Friends of 
the Tecate Cypress. 
</P>
<P>
 Another supporter is the Irvine Co., the largest developer in Orange County, 
which contributed $60,000 toward the approximately $2 million raised statewide 
to support CALPAW. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the proposition, three pieces of property owned by the Irvine Co. would 
receive funding to turn it into open space. The properties include the Laguna 
Laurel and Upper Newport Bay sites and a site near Irvine Lake. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the three Irvine Co. parcels, however, only the Laguna Laurel site has been 
negotiated for sale, said Larry Thomas, an Irvine Co. spokesman. The other two 
sites were selected by environmentalists and haven't been discussed with the 
company, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not our initiative and it wasn't drawn by us," said Thomas, although 
he added that the company is willing to discuss any of the land purchases. 
</P>
<P>
 The initiative's opponents, including the California Chamber of Commerce, the 
California Cattlemens Assn. and the Farm Bureau Federation, say the proposition 
may be well-meaning but would be too costly for taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bottom line is California cannot afford all the bonds on the June 
ballot," said Cliff Moriyama, the director of agriculture and resources for the 
state Chamber of Commerce. "We must prioritize our expenditures and this is 
pretty much a luxury." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Moriyama listed other statewide problems such as traffic congestion, 
infrastructure and crime, as higher priorities for limited state funds. 
</P>
<P>
 "The parks may need the help, but we believe there are other areas where our 
funds should go," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But for environmentalists, the issue is critical. 
</P>
<P>
 Pete DeSimone, manager of the Audubon Society's Starr Ranch preserve near Coto 
de Caza, said it would help preserve county habitat for thousands of species of 
plants and animals. 
</P>
<P>
 "This would be a tremendous boost for us," DeSimone said. "Any money we can 
pull together to buy important habitat will just add to our cause of protecting 
the county's shrinking wilderness." 
</P>
<P>
 The land proposed for funding in Orange County was selected by the statewide 
Planning and Conservation League based on location, potential as natural 
habitat, and the threat of imminent development. 
</P>
<P>
 Connie Spenger of Fullerton, a member of the Friends of the Tecate Cypress, 
said the areas in Coal Canyon that would benefit are "crucial properties" 
because they are connected to the Cleveland National Forest and help maintain 
large, contiguous areas of habitat. 
</P>
<P>
 "These areas are part of a large picture," Spenger said. "We are finding that 
even our national parks are losing species because they are isolated from other 
large blocks of wild lands. When you fragment, you lose important pieces of the 
picture."

MISSING GIRL IS BACK HOME; INQUIRY: 11-YEAR-OLD WAS REPORTEDLY TAKEN TO TIJUANA 
BY HER PARENTS' FORMER BOARDER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 An 11-year-old girl was reunited with her family Tuesday, three days after she 
was reportedly abducted by a family friend who took her to Tijuana, where she 
was left to fend for herself. 
</P>
<P>
 Police are looking for Valentin Gonzalez, 22, who for two years was a boarder 
at her parents' apartment. Garden Grove Lt. John Woods said Gonzalez is wanted 
for questioning in the alleged abduction and is believed to be in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 The girl, a sixth-grader at Dr. A.J. Cook Elementary School, allegedly was 
abducted by Gonzalez at about 2:30 p.m. Friday as she walked home from school 
with friends, according to police. Gonzalez had moved out of the home he shared 
with the girl's family four days before the alleged abduction, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities declined to discuss charges that could be filed against Gonzalez. 
Woods said the girl was "too shook" up Tuesday to take part in the criminal 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's going to be interviewed by the Child Abuse Services team (today) and 
there will also be a physical exam. We hope to know more about what happened 
after that," said Woods. 
</P>
<P>
 In a brief talk Tuesday at the family's modest apartment, the girl said 
Gonzalez surprised her as she walked home with four friends and allegedly 
pulled her into an empty car parked about two blocks away. 
</P>
<P>
 "He just grabbed me and took me," said the dark-eyed girl. "He took me. I 
didn't want to go with him." 
</P>
<P>
 During the interview, the young girl had difficulty concentrating and 
frequently got up to hug her 1-year-old brother and squeeze a stuffed toy. She 
responded in brief, often one-word answers. 
</P>
<P>
 After leaving Orange County, she said, Gonzalez Friday drove with her to 
Tijuana and checked into a seedy downtown hotel that night. The girl said 
Gonzalez threatened to harm her if she screamed for help. 
</P>
<P>
 The parents reported her missing Friday to police. They learned Saturday their 
daughter was in Tijuana from Gonzalez's sister, Irene Gonzalez, who also lives 
in Garden Grove. She told the girl's parents Saturday morning that her brother 
had called from Tijuana and said he had their daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 After checking out of the hotel, Gonzalez apparently called his sister and she 
told him that police were looking for him and his name was in the newspapers 
and on television, the girl said in an interview with The Times. 
</P>
<P>
 "He talked to his sister and got real scared. He said that my picture was in 
all the newspapers and on the TV news, and the police were looking for him," 
said the girl. "Then he told me to wait on the street for him, but he 
disappeared." 
</P>
<P>
 The girl's parents said she was unfamiliar with Tijuana and did not know how 
to get to the port-of-entry to return to the United States and could not find 
police. In the interview, she said she wandered around the city for three days, 
without food, and slept on the street for two nights. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, with the help of a merchant she managed to call her parents collect 
from a pay phone and continued calling several times throughout the day. The 
problem was that she had no idea where in Tijuana she was and no one was able 
to help her, the father said. 
</P>
<P>
 Late Monday night she called again and told the parents she was on the Mexican 
side at the port of entry, which she recognized. The frantic parents arranged 
for two friends to drive to Tijuana and pick her up. Garden Grove police 
assisted by writing a letter to immigration officials, saying she was the 
victim of a crime and asking them to allow the girl to return to Garden Grove. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bless the police. They've been nothing but good to us," said the girl's 
father. "I have nothing but good things to say about the officers who helped 
us." 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, the girl said she drew comfort throughout her ordeal by looking at 
the photos of her two younger brothers, who are 1 and 3, which she carries in 
her wallet. Along with the pictures of her brothers, she also had pictures of 
dolls and figurines, which she cut out of magazines.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: PLACENTIA/YORBA LINDA; SCHOOL COMPUTER PLANS UNVEILED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Placentia-Yorba Linda Unified School District officials this week unveiled an 
ambitious four-year plan to beef up technology in each of the district's 28 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan, which has not been approved by the Board of Trustees, is expected to 
cost $508,856. Most of that money will be spent on creating business computer 
labs at high schools and middle schools. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Supt. James O. Fleming, the project will be funded by several 
sources of "onetime money," primarily interest income earned on investments. 
</P>
<P>
 If approved, eight elementary schools will receive computers from the 
district's high schools and middle schools, which will receive new computers 
and equipment to build business labs. 
</P>
<P>
 According to a report prepared by Assistant Supt. Sharon McHolland, several 
teachers and other district employees, the objective is for each elementary 
school to have at least one 36-station computer lab. Some elementary schools 
already have such a lab, while others have obsolete equipment or fewer than 36 
computers. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed plan also calls for each middle school and high school to have a 
business lab with software commonly used in the business world. The labs will 
be equipped so that students can use various "information networks" and 
"computer bulletin boards."  
</P>
<P>
 "The purpose is to empower all students to become contributing and employable 
members of society," the report states. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan calls for all the computers to be transferred or purchased and 
installed this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Schools scheduled to get new equipment are Van Buren Elementary School, Yorba 
Linda Middle School, Bernardo Yorba Junior High, El Dorado High School, 
Valencia High School, Esperanza High School and El Camino Real Continuation 
School. 
</P>
<P>
 Golden Avenue, Glenknoll, Sierra Vista, Wagner, Morse Avenue, Glenview, 
Fairmont and Woodsboro elementary schools will receive equipment from the 
schools receiving new computers. 
</P>
<P>
 In the second through fourth years of the proposed plan, bar-coding technology 
will be installed in all school libraries and computers and software used by 
school secretaries will be upgraded. DANIELLE A. FOUQUETTE

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO; LOUD EXPLOSION TRACED TO TRAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID REYES

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The cause of a loud explosion that left frayed nerves, a damaged residence, 
and some big pieces of metal has been determined. 
</P>
<P>
 A Santa Fe railroad spokesman said Tuesday that a Santa Fe locomotive 
traveling from Barstow to San Diego was passing through South County on Sunday 
when its braking system overheated and "blew out" the cooling fans. 
</P>
<P>
 A turbine blade and pieces of metal weighing 10 to 30 pounds blew off the 
train as it passed Oso Road in San Juan Capistrano about 4 p.m., an Orange 
County sheriff's deputy spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The flying parts damaged a residence, Santa Fe spokesman Mike Martin said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're happy no one was injured," Martin said. "Apparently, some pieces 
damaged some sort of structure there, either an apartment or condominium 
complex. I'm sure that nearby residents are concerned about trains going by 
there throwing off metal parts. We can't guarantee this is not ever happening 
again, but it is a very rare occurrence." 
</P>
<P>
 When the locomotive's brakes are applied, it puts a drag on the wheels and 
heat then travels up on electrical grids that are cooled by large turbine 
blades three feet across that sit atop the rear of the locomotive. 
</P>
<P>
 However, in this case, Martin said the cooling system malfunctioned, "and as a 
result, disintegrated the fan." 
</P>
<P>
 "We take pride in making sure our locomotives operate properly and we're 
certainly not cutting any corners in our maintenance," Martin said. 
</P>
<P>
 The debris came from a fan blade and a metal grille from one of the 
locomotives pulling the 4,370-ton train with 46 cars, Martin said. 
</P>
<P>
 The track is used by both Santa Fe and Amtrak. After hearing of the incident, 
Amtrak officials inspected five of its locomotives that were operating between 
Los Angeles and San Diego that day. 
</P>
<P>
 "We checked our trains operating as early as 6 in the morning to as late as 
9:30 p.m. and couldn't find anything wrong or any locomotives with missing 
parts," Amtrak spokesman Clifford Black said. DAVID REYES

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; TEEN MAKES THE RIGHT CHESS MOVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BERT ELJERA

<TEXT>
<P>
 Harry Akopyan, 13, plays chess on his computer more and more these days. He 
has to, because few players his age can beat him. 
</P>
<P>
 On occasion, he plays against his father, but Onik Akopyan, 54, is no match 
for his son, either. 
</P>
<P>
 Akopyan, a sixth-grader at Los Feliz Elementary School in Los Angeles, is the 
national elementary school chess champion, a title he has won for the past five 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, Akopyan had the chance to challenge other kids when he took on 14 
youngsters ages 7 to 14. Simultaneously. 
</P>
<P>
 The result: 12 wins, one loss and one draw. 
</P>
<P>
 Played at the Chess for Juniors Center on Westminster Avenue in Garden Grove, 
the matches were Akopyan's first since winning this month's national elementary 
school championship in San Jose. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 1,000 kindergarten to sixth-grade students from around the country 
took part in the championship. Akopyan also won the speed tournament, in which 
players play against the clock, and against each other. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess it's winning that I like most about chess," said Akopyan, who came to 
the United States from his native Armenia when he was 7 years old. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, in faded denim pants, a blue T-shirt and a baseball cap, Akopyan 
faced 12 boys and two girls across two rows of tables. Playing the white 
pieces, he took just a few seconds to make his moves as he walked from one 
chessboard to another. 
</P>
<P>
 When he was 6, he was one of several players who faced Armenian grand master 
Arshak Petrosian in a similar match. He lost horribly, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But now, it was his turn to face an array of players. 
</P>
<P>
 "I liked it, it made me proud," Akopyan said. 
</P>
<P>
 After more than an hour, the games were finished, and the only winner against 
Akopyan was the tiniest in the group, 7-year-old Walter (Mao) Shatford, a 
first-grader at Polytechnic School in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 "Watching a 7-year-old play chess is like watching the Rams play football," 
said the boy's father, Walter Shatford III, himself a chess player and a 
football fan. "It's very nerve-racking." 
</P>
<P>
 Mao, who learned to play chess when he was 4 years old, surprised Akopyan by 
capturing a knight and then winning the end game with two passed pawns. 
</P>
<P>
 Justin Sheek, who was runner-up to Akopyan in the San Jose tournament, earned 
the draw. He had two pawns to Akopyan's one at the end of the 1 1/2-hour play. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnny Morgan, 11, a fifth-grader at Liberty Christian in Huntington Beach, 
was the first of the 14 players to lose to Akopyan, but he said he was happy 
with his game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I played good, but he's very good," said Morgan, who played in a New York 
tournament for junior high school students this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Elizabeth Thompson of Cypress, who watched her son, Daniel, lose to Akopyan, 
said that chess is a worthwhile sport for children. 
</P>
<P>
 "It helps him (Daniel) get better organized," Thompson said. "His 
problem-solving has improved a lot." 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Snyder, who founded the Chess for Juniors Center in 1983, said that 
chess teaches logic, concentration and critical thinking. More than 120 boys 
and girls attend his classes. He is often invited to make chess presentations 
in schools, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said that Akopyan is his most talented and hardest-working student. 
</P>
<P>
 "He listens, he is easy to work with, and he does not have an ego that gets in 
the way," Snyder said. BERT ELJERA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; STANTON ASSAILS MOULTON PATTERSON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN JOHNSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 County Supervisor Roger R. Stanton contends that the election of Huntington 
Beach Mayor Linda Moulton Patterson to the Board of Supervisors would damage 
county government and allow state Democrats to establish a fund-raising 
beachhead in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 "If she is elected, the conservative orientation and stability of county 
government will be severely damaged," Stanton said in a May 21 letter touting 
the candidacy of Jim Silva, a Huntington Beach councilman who also among the 
five candidates running for the seat being vacated by Supervisor Harriett M. 
Wieder. 
</P>
<P>
 "Specifically, (Moulton Patterson) and her husband, former Democratic 
Congressman Jerry Patterson, would then be in a position to solicit big 
contributions for Democratic candidates," Stanton wrote. "This is the bad 
news." 
</P>
<P>
 Moulton Patterson said she believes Stanton's letter adds credibility to her 
campaign as the primary season enters its final week before Tuesday's election. 
</P>
<P>
 "This just confirms what people have been telling me," the mayor said. "I'm 
going to win this thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Democratic Party Chairwoman Dorianne Garcia said Stanton's 
letter is a reflection of a "paranoid" official. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm happy to see that he feels like Linda is a force to be reckoned with," 
Garcia said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rarely has a supervisor taken sides in campaigns outside his or her district, 
but Stanton is playing an increasingly active role in Silva's bid to succeed 
Wieder, whose 2nd District includes the cities of Costa Mesa, Cypress, Garden 
Grove, Huntington Beach, Los Alamitos, Seal Beach and Stanton. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Stanton nor Silva was available for comment Tuesday, but the 
supervisor has said that his support for Silva comes from their personal 
friendship of about 16 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the start of the campaign, Stanton, elected to the Board of Supervisors 
in 1980, has been sharing information with Silva on county issues and writing 
fund-raising letters for the candidate, the most recent being the May 21 letter 
to at least 300 local business leaders, a Silva campaign official said. 
</P>
<P>
 The recent letter describes Moulton Patterson as a "liberal Democrat" and 
names Silva as the "only" candidate in the five-candidate race capable of 
beating the Huntington Beach mayor in a likely November runoff. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanton's letter does not mention the other candidates as possible threats in 
the race, not even the well-financed campaign of Huntington Beach businesswoman 
Haydee V. Tillotson. Raymond Thomas Littrell and John A. Thomas also are 
running. 
</P>
<P>
 But the supervisor's letter clearly centers on the emergence of a Democrat as 
a threat to the Republican-dominated Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 "For at least a dozen years, the citizens of Orange County have been 
represented by the most conservative Board of Supervisors in the state of 
California," Stanton said. "The absence of liberal Democrats on the board has 
served as a barrier which prevented Democrats from accessing a fund-raising 
source. . . . Please don't take this situation for granted. It could change 
this June." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials in the county registrar of voters office estimated that it has been 
at least 15 years since a Democrat was on the Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanton told prospective donors that Silva's presence in a likely runoff in 
November was "vital" and that more money was needed to make that happen. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sitting on the sidelines until after the June primary is a very bad business 
decision," Stanton said. "The most prudent business plan is obvious: Contribute 
financially as much as you possibly can now."KEVIN JOHNSON

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FULLERTON; INTERSECTION SAFETY PETITION CIRCULATED

<P>
 Stacey Smith is tired of seeing people get hit and cars collide on the busy 
street corner outside her apartment. 
</P>
<P>
 So Smith and her neighbors have started a petition drive, soliciting 
signatures from people who live near the intersection of Commonwealth Avenue 
and State College Boulevard. They are gathering names on the street corner and 
plan to take the list to City Hall in an effort to ask city officials to make 
the intersection safer. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though the intersection has a traffic light and a crossing guard helps 
children get across in the mornings and after school, residents claim the 
intersection is still dangerous. They said they want left-turn-arrow signals 
installed to cut down on accidents. 
</P>
<P>
 "I get to hear the squealing of the tires, the crashing of the glass and the 
crunching of the metal from speeding cars, and I've called 911 many times," 
said Smith, 37. "It really makes me nervous and scared. If this problem doesn't 
get immediate attention, someone is going to get killed." 
</P>
<P>
 Smith said she is afraid to let her 6-year-old daughter, Marcie Treadwell, 
cross the intersection alone. She said she walks Marcie to Commonwealth 
Elementary School. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you're a pedestrian, drivers don't think about how it is to walk across 
the street. They're always in such a hurry that they tend to go faster without 
regard to the kids walking in front of them," Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police have reported four accidents at the Commonwealth and State College 
intersection since January, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith's husband, Walter Treadwell, said he's been a witness to some of those 
accidents. "The intersection is an ongoing problem," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith and Treadwell said they have already collected about 50 signatures on 
their petitions and plan to collect several hundred more before presenting them 
to the City Council next month. 
</P>
<P>
 Usually, when residents make requests for traffic signals, the requests are 
studied by the Traffic Department and the city's Transportation Committee, 
officials said. MIMI KO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA ANA; GOP CANDIDATE EXITS 69TH DISTRICT RACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEBE MARTINEZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Convinced that he could not raise enough money to win the Republican 
nomination in the 69th Assembly District next week, candidate Martin Ageson 
dropped out of the race Tuesday and endorsed apparent front-runner Jim 
Morrissey. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it became clear that we were not going to win, and that I could do 
more good by trying to make sure that the best Republican remaining in the race 
would win, and that is Jim Morrissey," Ageson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ageson's withdrawal from the race was first announced by the Morrissey 
campaign. Ageson made the decision after the Morrissey campaign briefed him on 
a poll that was conducted last week, a Morrissey spokesman said. The poll 
showed that if Ageson did not pull out, he could take enough votes away from 
Morrissey to possibly cause the victory of a third Republican candidate in the 
race, Virgel L. Nickell, the spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the Morrissey campaign poll, which was not publicly released but 
was characterized in general terms, Morrissey was in first place and Nickell in 
second, with Ageson and Judy Buffin-Edge trailing in third and fourth places. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know if I agree with the poll numbers, but it was clear we did not 
have the (financial) resources to win . . . and the only thing we could have 
done potentially was hurt Jim," Ageson said. 
</P>
<P>
 According to campaign finance statement filed last week, Morrissey had raised 
$104,918 for his campaign -- $60,000 coming from personal loans he made to his 
campaign. Ageson had raised $35,792. 
</P>
<P>
 Nickell ran for the Assembly seat two years ago, losing in the Republican 
primary after a bitter battle with local GOP leader Jo Ellen Allen. The 
Democratic incumbent, Assemblyman Tom Umberg of Garden Grove, beat Allen in the 
general election. 
</P>
<P>
 Umberg is leaving the office to make a bid for state attorney general, and the 
local GOP sees the seat as a good opportunity to take away from Orange County 
Democrats the only state legislative or congressional seat they now hold. 
</P>
<P>
 The possibility of Nickell winning in a four-way race "was of great concern to 
me when I saw the numbers," Morrissey said Tuesday. "The party cannot afford to 
have Nickell win. Nickell cannot win in November. . . . We think he's rather 
weak in a whole bunch of areas. Nickell has not the endorsement of any 
Republican leaders." 
</P>
<P>
 Morrissey praised Ageson's decision to drop out, saying: "It shows the 
character of the gentleman, not just to bow out, but to endorse me and offer to 
help in any way that would be helpful." 
</P>
<P>
 Nickell, who jump-started his campaign with a $50,000 personal loan, asked: 
"What's the big deal?" 
</P>
<P>
 He added: "The Sacramento interests had endorsed both of these candidates 
(Morrissey and Ageson) and so the politicians are endorsing one candidate now 
and the people of this district are going to be electing me." 
</P>
<P>
 Buffin-Edge said she was surprised by Ageson's move. However, she vowed to 
stay in the race to the end. 
</P>
<P>
 "It looks like the business-as-usual bunch has sacrificed one of their own to 
try to keep me from winning, and nothing changes," she said. "Ageson's name is 
still on the ballot." GEBE MARTINEZ

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SEAL BEACH; PIER FIRE INQUIRY FOCUSES ON 2 ANGLERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The investigation into the May 21 fire at the Seal Beach Pier is centering on 
two fishermen who witnesses said were operating a makeshift barbecue in the 
middle of the boardwalk just before the blaze began. 
</P>
<P>
 Fire investigators suspect that hot charcoals from the grill somehow fell 
through cracks in the wood boardwalk and landed on a plastic gas line that runs 
under the length of the pier. The gas line then ignited, they suspect. Fire 
officials do not know the identity of the fishermen, but witnesses told 
investigators that the pair have several prominent tattoos, said Fire Capt. Dan 
Young. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not looking to arrest them," Young said. "We want them to assist in 
the investigation. We don't have any indication that this was set 
intentionally." 
</P>
<P>
 The new details came from two witnesses whom fire investigators interviewed 
over the weekend. The witnesses also were fishing near the middle of the pier 
that day and saw the fire in its early stages, Young said. 
</P>
<P>
 The witnesses reported seeing two men fishing on the east end of the pier with 
an aluminum bowl-like object that resembled a disposable roasting pot, Young 
said. The witnesses said the pot was being used as a barbecue and appeared to 
emit smoke. 
</P>
<P>
 A few minutes later, the fire erupted on the boardwalk and the witnesses said 
they noticed the two fishermen running from the scene, Young said. Other 
witnesses also have described two men with tattoos running off the pier as the 
fire started. 
</P>
<P>
 "There may have been no reason for them to run except that they were scared," 
Young said. "We have no evidence to the contrary." 
</P>
<P>
 City laws prohibit the operation of grills on the pier, which is one of the 
few wood boardwalks in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Young said charcoals can reach a temperature of 1,500 degrees. Hot coals 
easily could burn through an aluminum roasting pot and fall through cracks in 
the boardwalk, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 40 people have called the fire department to report tips about the 
pier blaze, which caused at least $350,000 in damage and temporarily stranded 
more than 100 people. No one was injured. SHELBY GRAD

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: IRVINE; DISTRICT MIGHT APPEAL CHEERLEADER RULING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHELBY GRAD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Irvine school board could decide next week whether to fight a 4th District 
Court of Appeal ruling that found the district's eligibility policy for 
cheerleaders to be unfair. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week's court decision stemmed from a lawsuit filed by a former Woodbridge 
High School pep squad member who was forced off the team after her grade-point 
average dropped below 2.5. 
</P>
<P>
 District rules require that a 2.5 average out of a possible 4.0 must be 
maintained by cheerleaders, members of student government and others involved 
in extracurricular activities that run for more than one semester. 
</P>
<P>
 Students involved in extracurricular activities that last for one semester or 
less -- such as football and basketball players -- need only maintain a 2.0 
grade-point average to remain eligible. 
</P>
<P>
 The appeals court last Friday said the district's current rules were 
unbalanced and unfair to cheerleaders who must abide by the higher standards. 
The court directed the district to create a single eligibility standard for 
both athletes and others who participate in after-school activities. 
</P>
<P>
 Superintendent David E. Brown said Tuesday that the school board needs to 
decide whether to stand by the current rules and appeal the court's decision or 
change the eligibility standards. 
</P>
<P>
 The school board will discuss the matter at Tuesday's meeting. Because it is a 
legal matter, the item will be taken up during a closed session. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do not think this was the right judgment," Brown said.  
</P>
<P>
 Brown stressed that the appeals court rejected contentions that the Irvine 
policy amounted to sexual discrimination and involved a violation of state open 
meeting laws.SHELBY GRAD

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA ANA; ALTERNATIVE SITE FOR 'SPACE SAVER' URGED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEE ROMNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Santa Ana schools trustee Rosemarie Avila has sent an open letter to her 
fellow board members, urging them to choose another site for a controversial 
"space-saver" school now slated to be built at a shopping center here.  
</P>
<P>
 "I am requesting that we move quickly to submit another space-saver project in 
case this one is denied by the state," Avila said in her letter, dated Monday.  
</P>
<P>
 "This space-saver concept offers us a great opportunity to receive priority 
funding. We must act immediately to be first in line again should we lose the 
Marketplace site." 
</P>
<P>
 The school might be funded under a novel state program designed to build 
schools in congested urban areas without condemning homes or businesses.  
</P>
<P>
 But the issue of the school has sharply divided the board, as well as the City 
Council and residents who live near the proposed site. 
</P>
<P>
 In February, the school board majority voted to approve the Bristol 
Marketplace site at Bristol and 17th streets. The school district had already 
sent a preliminary appraisal for the site to state officials, who set nearly 
$23 million aside for the project.  
</P>
<P>
 Since then, the shopping center property has come under fire from some local 
residents and officials who said the Santa Ana Unified School District didn't 
give adequate consideration to cheaper sites.  
</P>
<P>
 State officials also have criticized the steep preliminary appraisal for 
including the cost to tear down and rebuild two buildings at the mall. 
</P>
<P>
 The State Allocation Board will vote next month on whether to proceed or 
revoke Santa Ana's funding altogether. 
</P>
<P>
 In her letter, Avila said the parents of Santa Ana have been placed on "a 
roller-coaster ride" as the site has been debated. She urged that some 
boarded-up apartments on a 12-acre property valued at $6.9 million be 
considered instead. 
</P>
<P>
 But other board members and district officials have criticized that property 
as untenable. The blighted apartments are tied up in litigation and would have 
to be annexed from the Orange School District.LEE ROMNEY

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ORANGE; UNION CLASHES WITH DISTRICT ON BENEFITS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Less than three weeks following a first-ever strike by non-teaching employees 
in the Orange Unified School District, union and district officials are still 
at odds over the amount of the union's health benefits package. 
</P>
<P>
 Union officials say they have offered the district a new plan that would 
reduce annual insurance costs from $4.9 million to about $4.4 million.But the 
district -- facing about a $2-million shortfall in its $107-million 1994-95 
budget -- says the union still needs to find approximately $130,000 more in 
savings. 
</P>
<P>
 The district and union officials ended talks last Thursday, and union 
officials seemed to have little hope this week of renewing discussions. 
</P>
<P>
 "It makes me sick," said Becky Mayers, president of the California School 
Employees Assn., Chapter 67. "I wonder what it is they want from us." 
</P>
<P>
 The union represents about 1,160 classified employees, including custodial, 
maintenance, clerical workers and bus drivers. 
</P>
<P>
 District officials say they want to keep channels open but insist the union 
must come up with the additional savings. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can't deny the fact we have a shortfall," said Jack Elsner, the district's 
head of personnel. MARTIN MILLER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: BUENA PARK; MAYOR DENIES CITY BROKE MEETINGS LAW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLEY WRIGHT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mayor Donald L. Bone on Tuesday denied charges that the City Council violated 
the state open meetings law when it met in closed session in early February to 
discuss hiring a consultant. 
</P>
<P>
 The charges that the council violated the law were made in a letter by a 
resident to the Orange County district attorney.They stem from a controversial 
council decision May 16 to close the city Fire Department and contract with the 
county for fire protection and paramedic services. 
</P>
<P>
 The consultant, Robert W. Kuznik, was paid $10,000 to review and verify the 
information contained in a study that would be used to decide whether to 
contract with the county for fire services, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bone said that no vote was taken during the closed meeting and that the city 
manager had the authority to hire the consultant. He said the council directed 
City Manager Kevin O'Rourke to hire Kuznik but that the council's instructions 
did not constitute a vote. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was never a vote taken to hire the consultant," Bone said. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Rourke added that the council met to discuss the consultant's capability and 
cost in closed session because some of the documents they referred to had to do 
with negotiating labor issues with the Orange County Fire Department. The open 
meetings law, known as the Brown Act, permits those issues to be confidential, 
O'Rourke said. 
</P>
<P>
 Marc Kelly, deputy district attorney, said Tuesday that he is reviewing a 
response from the mayor to see if he will pursue any action. 
</P>
<P>
 Max Schulman, who wrote the letter to the district attorney, said he remains 
convinced the Brown Act was violated and that some enforcement action would be 
appropriate.LESLEY WRIGHT

JUDGE TEMPORARILY HALTS WORK ON SAN JOAQUIN TOLLWAY; COURTS: THE ORDER IS 
HAILED AS 'A POSITIVE FIRST STEP' BY SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO ACTIVISTS WHO ALLEGE 
THAT THE HIGHWAY INTERCHANGE WILL POLLUTE THE AIR AND DEVALUE THEIR HOMES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 In the continuing battle over the planned San Joaquin Hills tollway, a 
Superior Court judge issued an order Tuesday temporarily halting work along the 
southern end of the road linking it with Interstate 5 in San Juan Capistrano. 
</P>
<P>
 Responding to a recent lawsuit by a San Juan Capistrano community group 
challenging the tollway interchange, Judge Leonard Goldstein issued the 
temporary order pending a court hearing June 17. 
</P>
<P>
 Save Our San Juan, or SOS, alleges in the suit that San Juan Capistrano and 
the San Joaquin Hills Transportation Corridor Agency failed to do required 
environmental studies for the interchange, which includes moving part of Rancho 
Viejo Road east to make way for the corridor. Community activists claim the 
interchange would be too close to their homes, polluting their neighborhoods 
and destroying home values. They are demanding the city and toll road agency do 
more studies to determine what effects the interchange could have on their 
neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 SOS activists called the judge's decision Tuesday "a positive first step." 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel the judge's decision at least gives us some protection that we should 
be getting from the city," SOS spokesman Robert P. King said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a war and the (toll road agency) has won some battles lately and it 
hurt," he continued. "We won a battle today and it feels good. But the war will 
still go on." 
</P>
<P>
 Tollway agency spokesman Mike Stockstill, however, said the temporary delay 
will not seriously hurt the project, and that some tollway-related work in the 
San Juan Capistrano area can continue. He added that arguments being used by 
SOS are similar to those raised in another tollway lawsuit involving a UC 
Irvine parcel that was rejected last month by a state appellate court. 
</P>
<P>
 "We really view this as a frivolous and a last-ditch effort to try and stop 
the corridor by SOS," Stockstill said. 
</P>
<P>
 San Juan Capistrano officials could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 The 17.2-mile toll road project would wind from the Corona del Mar Freeway in 
Newport Beach through Laguna Niguel and merge with the Interstate 5 freeway in 
San Juan Capistrano near Avery Parkway. 
</P>
<P>
 A council majority recently decided not to challenge the planned tollway 
interchange in San Juan Capistrano in exchange for about $2.5 million in 
roadway and other improvements from the project builder. The council's decision 
also meant the corridor agency could proceed with the interchange construction 
without having to deal with the city's building permit process, a move 
protested by SOS. 
</P>
<P>
 The court order temporarily halts construction work on about two miles of the 
corridor's southern tip, south of Paseo de Colinas in Laguna Niguel. The order 
does not prevent the tollway agency from continuing work north of Paseo de 
Colinas or along Interstate 5 at the planned interchange. The agency can also 
continue some tollway-related projects south of Paseo de Colinas, including 
surveying and right-of-way acquisition.

POLICE SEIZE ITEMS WHERE MURDER SUSPECT MORGAN LIVED; INVESTIGATION: 
APPLICATION FOR SEARCH WARRANT SAID OFFICERS WERE LOOKING FOR BLOODSTAINED 
CLOTHING, JEWELRY.

 Police searching the apartment shared by Edward Patrick Morgan Jr., accused of 
murdering a Huntington Beach woman, seized a hoop earring, martial arts weapons 
and pants similar to a pair described by witnesses in the case, according to 
documents released Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said Morgan was seen leaving the Australia Beach Club on West 
Metropolitan Street in Orange on May 19 with Leanora Annette Wong, whose 
battered and mutilated body was discovered the next day in a parking lot across 
the street.  
</P>
<P>
 Morgan, 28, was arrested May 22 in the Northern California town of Quincy and 
has been charged with first-degree murder with special circumstance, which 
could result in the death penalty. Police said Wong had been sexually 
assaulted. 
</P>
<P>
 On May 21, police searched Morgan's apartment in the 500 block of East Palm 
Avenue. In their request for the warrant, authorities said they were looking 
for "bloodstained clothing . . . bloodstained jewelry," Morgan's parole papers 
or newspaper articles about Wong's death. 
</P>
<P>
 Police declined to say whether the earring belonged to the 23-year-old Wong, 
or whether bloodstains were found on it or the seized pants or two sets of 
nunchakus -- a type of flail with wooden sticks attached to either end of a 
length of cord or chain. Police also found a Bible with Morgan's name on it and 
his parole papers. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the warrant, a man identifying himself as Morgan's roommate 
called them after Wong's body was discovered and a composite sketch of Morgan 
was shown on television and said that Morgan was the man who slept in his 
living room. The man said he had gone to the Australia Beach Club with Morgan, 
but that Morgan had returned to the apartment by himself later that night. 
</P>
<P>
 Bartenders at the nightclub told police that a man matching Morgan's 
description was bothering them the night of the murder, and that they 
considered ejecting him before he left.

TREASURER CANDIDATE SAYS COUNTY PORTFOLIO VALUE DOWN; POLITICS: MOORLACH BLAMES 
CITRON STRATEGY FOR $1.2-BILLION DECLINE. OFFICIAL SAYS FIGURES WRONG. 
</P>

 Orange County treasurer-tax collector candidate John M.W. Moorlach claimed 
Tuesday that incumbent Robert L. Citron's investment strategies have caused the 
county's investment portfolio to decline in value by an estimated $1.2 billion 
in the last five months. 
</P>
<P>
 In a Tuesday letter to Board of Supervisors Chairman Thomas F. Riley, Moorlach 
said the decline has resulted from Citron's reliance on a strategy that depends 
on interest rates remaining low. The loss brings the paper value of the 
county's portfolio to $6.3 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 "Overall," Moorlach said in the letter, "the portfolio is a major bull-market 
bet in the middle of bear market. The incumbent has structured the portfolio 
only on the premise that interest rates would continue to decline for the next 
four years." 
</P>
<P>
 Riley, who has endorsed Citron's reelection bid, said he had reviewed 
Moorlach's analysis but retained his confidence in the incumbent. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've checked with a number of financial agencies, and none of them feel like 
any major dangers are involved," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant Treasurer Matthew R. Raabe said Moorlach's figures are in error. He 
described the challenger's study as a "last-minute chance to get publicity for 
his campaign." 
</P>
<P>
 In his letter, Moorlach questions Citron's money-management style, which uses 
the county U.S. Treasury bills and bonds as collateral for short-term borrowing 
at low interest. The borrowed funds are in turn invested in corporate bonds and 
securities that pay a higher rate of return. This can yield large returns while 
interest rates remain low and stable, Moorlach said. But the plan can also fail 
when interest rates rise, as they have in recent months, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In his analysis of the county portfolio, Moorlach estimated that the decline 
in value amounted to $1,000 per registered voter in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Since January, the county has had to post an additional $300 million in 
collateral because the value of the securities used to borrow the money has 
declined as interest rates have increased. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mr. Citron believes he can accurately anticipate the market all the time, and 
also outperform everyone," Moorlach said in the letter. "That's impossible."

WHEN HIRING A LAWYER, DON'T HESITATE TO LAY DOWN THE LAW ON CHARGES, SERVICES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 You're buying a house, getting a divorce or have just broken your leg after a 
fall at the office. Everyone tells you to get a lawyer, and your first question 
is, "How?" 
</P>
<P>
 Finding a lawyer is easy. There are advertisements on television, in telephone 
directories, on billboards, even on buses and subways. There's also word of 
mouth and recommendations from family and friends. 
</P>
<P>
 But once you find a lawyer, deciding whether to retain him or her to represent 
you takes some effort. Remember, lawyers can cost up to hundreds of dollars an 
hour -- a major investment -- so this should be taken very seriously. 
</P>
<P>
 Shopping for a lawyer is not much different from shopping for a car: You read 
the literature, give it a test drive and feel free to look under the hood. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbara J. Swist, founder of Consumers for Legal Reform, a nonprofit 
organization based in Irvine, says the first thing to do is interview the 
lawyer to see if you like him or her. 
</P>
<P>
 Before you even step in the door, though, ask what, if anything, the initial 
interview will cost. Some lawyers will meet with prospective clients free, but 
others charge their regular hourly fee. You won't know unless you ask. 
</P>
<P>
 If, for whatever reason, you don't have a good feeling when you meet the 
lawyer, walk. There are plenty of others to choose from. 
</P>
<P>
 Before you decide to hire a lawyer, meet with him or her in the office, check 
out the surroundings, and be prepared with a list of questions to be answered. 
You can tell a lot about a person by his or her office. Papers and files lying 
haphazardly around may indicate that they might be sloppy handling your case as 
well. 
</P>
<P>
 Swist suggests that you ask about the lawyer's professional background and the 
background of the firm. Ask about legal malpractice insurance and ask to see a 
copy of the policy. 
</P>
<P>
 Ask how many attorneys will be handling your case, and find out your 
attorney's trial experience. 
</P>
<P>
 It is essential that you understand the fee structure before you get started, 
Swist said. 
</P>
<P>
 There are basically three different types of fee arrangements or combinations. 
</P>
<P>
 The first is a flat fee, where the lawyer agrees to do something for a 
specific amount of money. This could be, for example, $200 to draw up a simple 
will or X amount for the closing on the sale or purchase of a house. 
</P>
<P>
 The second is a contingent fee, where the lawyer agrees to get a percentage of 
the recovery of damages. This would usually occur if you were suing someone. 
The fee could be one-third or more depending on the agreement. If there is no 
recovery, there is no legal fee. But some lawyers will still hold the client 
responsible for some expenses. You have to ask. 
</P>
<P>
 The third is an hourly rate, in which the attorney keeps track of his or her 
work by 15-minute increments. Many consumers are unaware that telephone calls 
to the attorney are often billed as work time, as are photocopying, secretarial 
services and research. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Swist reminds consumers that all fees are negotiable. But fees should be in 
writing and agreements must state what work will be done by the attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 When dealing with a contingent fee, find out if it is based on gross or net 
recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyers are generally unable to give a firm estimate of how high fees will run 
because of so many vagaries in the legal process. But consumers should ask for, 
and receive, a sample monthly billing statement so they can see what is being 
charged. 
</P>
<P>
 Many attorneys request a non-refundable retainer, a fee that is a deposit 
toward future payment. 
</P>
<P>
 In Swist's 22-minute video, "Legal Secrets -- How to Hire a Lawyer," Mac 
Jacobs, a Southern California trial attorney, says a lawyer should agree to 
keep only the portion of the retainer he actually earned should the client and 
attorney stop working together before the case is concluded. 
</P>
<P>
 Swist says consumers should ask for references, receive them and check them 
out. And the client should feel free to set standards -- phone calls returned 
within 24 hours, copies of all case-related correspondence, etc., and have the 
attorney agree to those standards. 
</P>
<P>
 Knowing what you are buying and how much it will cost before sticker shock 
hits you can make your legal experience more satisfying, and possibly more 
successful.

FLOCK OF COMPLAINTS; NEIGHBORS IN POSH AREA SAY FARM'S 600 OSTRICHES ARE JUST 
TOO FOUL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 OK, one ostrich, that could be a pet, neighbors say. Two, maybe. But 600 of 
the flightless fowl, next to their multimillion dollar homes -- that's a 
nuisance. 
</P>
<P>
 Add 500 emus -- a relative of the ostrich -- 200 goats and 10 llamas, and you 
have a zoo, they claim. 
</P>
<P>
 The birds and other creatures at Mohilef Farms -- numbering over 1,000, 
according to a worker there Tuesday -- certainly seem out of place next to the 
groomed hedges, BMWs and 15,000-square-foot homes in Monteria Estates, a gated 
community in northern Chatsworth that is one of the wealthiest districts in Los 
Angeles. But neighbors say the animals are more than just a lumbering, feathery 
blight. 
</P>
<P>
 "The urine from the birds is kind of like an ammonia," said Greg Butts, whose 
property abuts the menagerie's home. "It makes manure smell like Liz 
Claiborne." 
</P>
<P>
 Farm owner David Mohilef declined to comment on the allegations. But 
neighbors, both within the gated compound and outside its walls, have become 
increasingly vocal in their complaints. 
</P>
<P>
 "The dust, the feathers, the pulverized feces and urine . . . all over the 
neighborhood," said Vin Fichter, who lives downwind of the farm. "Some of the 
most expensive homes in the Valley are right there." 
</P>
<P>
 Responding to dozens of complaints from homeowners, the City Zoning 
Administration has scheduled a hearing for July 11 to determine whether Mohilef 
Farms -- which is on land zoned for agricultural use -- is a commercial 
venture, and if so, to decide if it is a public nuisance. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is allowed to have . . . fowl, as long as he can contain whatever number 
there might be under healthy conditions," said Lee Hintlian, legislative deputy 
for City Councilman Hal Bernson, who represents the area. "In our opinion, it 
is probably a commercial operation, and as such is subject to a nuisance 
investigation." 
</P>
<P>
 If the farm is determined to be a nuisance, City Planning Investigator Vincent 
Quitoriano said, then limits may be imposed. 
</P>
<P>
 A woman identifying herself only as the manager of the farm approached a 
reporter near the compound Tuesday and spoke briefly before driving off. 
</P>
<P>
 "We keep it immaculate," she said. "They clean the pens every day. Do you 
smell anything?" 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, there was nothing malodorous in the air Tuesday afternoon, though 
neighbors claim the stench is strongest in the morning and evening. 
</P>
<P>
 Mohilef has long kept animals on the approximately six-acre property, 
including various exotic birds, and there were no problems in years past, 
neighbors said. And when the ostriches began appearing in small numbers some 
time last year, they were little more than an interesting anomaly on the 
well-kept landscape. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't really notice them at first," said Butts. 
</P>
<P>
 And then, according to several in the area, as the number of creatures began 
increasing, so did the acidic odor and wind-whipped fecal matter. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have the pool cleaned three times a week it's so bad," said Mark Byrnes, a 
San Diego architect and contractor who has been living in a neighboring house 
the last six weeks overseeing earthquake repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 While Mohilef declined to say why he had some 600 ostriches at his place, the 
notoriously dimwitted creatures are increasingly in demand as livestock, raised 
for their meat, leather and feathers. Ostrich ranches have been popping up 
around the country, and the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Ostrich meat -- which is red like beef, not white like chicken -- is very low 
in fat and cholesterol, and tastes like "filet mignon," in the words of one 
local ostrich rancher. The birds also provide an expensive pliable leather, and 
feathers that resist static electricity, and so are useful in the cleaning of 
delicate computer equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 This is not the first time the skittish, wide-eyed, 350-pound animals have 
made news locally, either. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors of a Topanga ostrich ranch -- which had just 12 birds -- voiced many 
of the same complaints as the neighbors in Monteria Estates and forced that 
operation to move last month.  
</P>
<P>
 A Sunland man who pleaded guilty last year to stealing seven young ostriches 
-- a mating pair can fetch $75,000 -- was sentenced to three years probation 
and 60 days community service. 
</P>
<P>
 While awaiting the July 11 hearing -- to be held at 9 a.m. at the Sherman Oaks 
Woman's Club at 4808 Kester Ave. -- the ostriches and emus and goats and llamas 
at Monteria Estates will continue to live the high life. 
</P>
<P>
 And neighbors say they will continue to clean their pools.

LANDMARK RESTAURANT PREPARES TO RISE FROM THE ASHES OF ARSON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Comedian Bob Hope could often be found sitting at the bar. 
</P>
<P>
 Other locals loved it for its sweeping vista of the northeast San Fernando 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 The Castaway restaurant, a 31-year-old, city-owned landmark perched high up in 
the Verdugo Hills, also drew Burbank-based companies such as the Walt Disney 
Co., NBC and Lockheed for get-togethers in nearby banquet rooms. 
</P>
<P>
 "People would come and sip a pina colada, listen to a song and warm their 
hands on a furnace," recalled Rod Westmaas, director of catering for The 
Castaway's banquet center. "More than a restaurant, it was an institution. When 
the fire went up, many said many dreams and memories went up in smoke." 
</P>
<P>
 Today, meeting rooms and a fenced-off pile of debris surrounded by palm trees 
are all that remain of the restaurant, which was destroyed last summer by an 
arsonist still at large. 
</P>
<P>
 But the restaurant's operators hope to begin rebuilding in July with about 
$2.2 million in insurance proceeds and to reopen for business in December. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, two large banquet rooms next to the restaurant are still 
functional, serving as the sites for weddings, company parties and high school 
proms. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not up to our former strength yet, but we've come back strong," 
Westmaas said. 
</P>
<P>
 When it is resurrected, the hilltop restaurant will look much as it did before 
from the inside -- an island retreat. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, however, there will be a sprinkler system, an indoor waterfall, a 
higher ceiling, larger bathrooms, an exterior made of rough cedar and a lobby 
three times the original size. 
</P>
<P>
 "To me, it needed a face lift badly. The toilets were an embarrassment as far 
as I was concerned," said Ron Weil, director of design for Specialty 
Restaurants Corp., an Anaheim-based company which leases The Castaway from the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
 The company hoped to expand from about 14,000 square feet to about 18,000. 
</P>
<P>
 But complaints from nearby residents who worry about increased driving to and 
from the hilltop have forced corporation President David Tallichet to consider 
a more limited expansion. 
</P>
<P>
 Plans to expand the restaurant by 1,100 square feet were presented Tuesday to 
the Burbank City Council but council members, still uncertain of the 
environmental impacts on neighbors, voted 4-0 to continue a public hearing on 
the issue to June 21. 
</P>
<P>
 The June 29 fire resulted in more than $1 million in damage to the site. There 
still have been no suspects caught, despite a $10,000 reward offered by 
Specialty Restaurants Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 Some people living near The Castaway, such as Esther Christoffersen, have been 
grateful for the decreased noise and traffic ever since. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since The Castaway has gone in, the traffic has been horrendous," said 
Christoffersen, 74, who has lived on Harvard Road since 1949. "We can't sleep 
in our front bedroom because of the noise. It has just destroyed a quiet 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I had my druthers, I'd like to not see it rebuilt. We have enjoyed having 
the quietness of our street back again." 
</P>
<P>
 The fire forced most of the 200 people who worked at The Castaway restaurant 
and banquet center into the job market again. Some have coped well; others have 
not. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess I felt the pain of many employees who lost their job," Westmaas said. 
"One individual, a cocktail server, said her whole life was shot. Her whole 
psyche is out of whack. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd prefer not to believe it was an employee or a former employee (who 
started the fire). But you can never rule anything out."

OVERHAUL URGED FOR VALLEY BUS ROUTE NETWORK; TRANSIT: YEARLONG STUDY RECOMMENDS 
SCRAPPING THE GRID SYSTEM IN FAVOR OF NODES SERVED BY A HUB-AND-SPOKE LAYOUT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HENRY CHU, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The traditional grid system of bus routes in the San Fernando Valley should be 
scrapped in favor of a hub-and-spoke layout that would improve service to 
employment centers through links to commuter train and subway stops, according 
to preliminary recommendations for the first major overhaul of the area's bus 
network in two decades. 
</P>
<P>
 At a workshop held Tuesday in Pacoima, transportation planners unveiled the 
initial findings of a yearlong study that proposes establishing several transit 
nodes throughout the Valley from which bus lines would radiate. Instead of 
being confined to north-south and east-west routes, buses would be routed to 
major commercial and retail destinations from hubs such as Metrolink stations 
and future Metro Rail stops. 
</P>
<P>
 Synchronized schedules would allow for easier transfers, and high-frequency 
shuttles -- smaller than regular buses -- would patrol well-traveled routes 
between and within communities, according to the recommendations, developed 
jointly by city and county agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 "This project has been a long time in the making," said Russell Chisholm, 
manager of the study commissioned by the city Department of Transportation, the 
Metropolitan Transportation Authority and the county Department of Public 
Works. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is really the first all-agency (project) that's been undertaken with 
regard to restructuring bus services." 
</P>
<P>
 However, shadowing the sweeping study are proposed service cutbacks and fare 
hikes announced last week by the MTA. How the final recommendations will be 
accomplished in light of the MTA's projected $126-million annual operating 
deficit remains to be seen, although officials are optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we will be able to do most of what the study recommends," said Mark 
Dierking, the MTA's manager of government and public affairs for the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a reallocation of existing resources," not a request for more cash, 
added James Okazaki, chief of transit programs for the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Presented at a series of public workshops that began Tuesday, the proposals 
envision transit centers that hook up with Metrolink stations in Sylmar, 
Chatsworth and Burbank, and with a planned Red Line stop in Universal City. A 
major nexus would also be located at Warner Center, with others in Granada 
Hills and Sherman Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 All would adopt a "hub-and-spoke" pattern of bus lines rather than adhere to 
the traditional grid system. New routes would allow bus riders to travel around 
neighborhoods and the Valley on a single bus, without many of the confusing 
transfers now required to change directions on the grid. "Timed transfers" for 
passengers needing to switch lines would synchronize arrivals and departures to 
eliminate long waits. 
</P>
<P>
 The study also suggests express services on busy streets, such as San Fernando 
Road and Van Nuys Boulevard, and along well-frequented routes, such as that 
between the northeast Valley and Chatsworth or Warner Center. Residents could 
also use local shuttles for shorter hops, modeled after the city's DASH 
network. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very community-based," Dierking said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the study leans heavily on uniting bus and rail centers, the study's 
backers said the proposals would not benefit comparatively more affluent rail 
commuters at the expense of regular bus riders, who are often poorer and 
dependent on public transportation. They noted that the recommendations call 
for neighborhood bus lines and increased service in less affluent areas such as 
the northeast Valley, where bus ridership is higher. 
</P>
<P>
 But at Tuesday's forum in Pacoima, audience members cautioned that routes 
should serve not only employment centers but social service agencies, such as 
public hospitals and welfare offices. 
</P>
<P>
 Listeners also questioned the feasibility of the wide-ranging study at a time 
of fiscal turmoil for the MTA, the largest provider of bus service in the 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can talk about all this restructuring all you want, but the question is 
whether you can pay for any of it," said Irwin Rosenberg, a vice president with 
Laidlaw Transit Services, a Glendale-based private bus company. "I don't see 
how you can separate this study from the $126-million deficit." 
</P>
<P>
 Chisholm said planners kept the financial situation in mind in drafting the 
recommendations, which will be put in final form after all the workshops and 
presented to transit officials and policy-makers at a meeting in about two 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 If approved, after a process that could be delayed by the MTA's current round 
of budget talks and labor negotiations, the study's proponents hope that some 
of the short-range recommendations, such as consolidating some bus lines, can 
be carried out soon. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The $500,000 study was launched more than a year ago in an effort to gauge 
public opinion on the efficiency of the Valley's bus network. While transit 
officials have adjusted and refined the grid system since its institution 20 
years ago, the recommendations represent the most sweeping proposals yet for a 
region many residents feel is neglected by planners. 
</P>
<P>
 "That area (has) had the least amount of study since the grid went in," said 
Okazaki of the city transportation department. 
</P>
<P>
 Prodded by Valley public transportation advocates, officials agreed to examine 
Valley bus service. Dierking said the decision has proven to be justified, 
given the Valley's size. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's 25% of the operating area of the MTA," Dierking said. "So that's a good 
place to start."

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: BURBANK; VAN GETS A TOUCH OF BRASS 
</P>

 You won't see Ernest Steingold's specialized van on the cover of Road & Track. 
Or on a rotating platform at any auto show. But if you do see it on your 
street, it is 100% guaranteed to turn your head. 
</P>
<P>
 Steingold's labor of love, this most customized of vans, is a half-ton that 
GMC engineers wouldn't even recognize. It could be the 20-pound brass eagle 
with a 3-foot wingspan on the roof. Or the 100 brass unicorns and winged 
horses. Or the 30 life-size masks and 300 belt buckles. Or the $14,000 worth of 
coins. But this brass-covered beauty is one of a kind. 
</P>
<P>
 "One woman who had been all over the world told me my van was like the eighth 
wonder of the world and I should take it all over the world so people could see 
it," said Steingold, a 66-year-old Burbank resident. "That would be nice if 
someone would sponsor me." 
</P>
<P>
 The project, on which Steingold often spends six hours at a stretch, began 
when he bought just your average used van in 1978. Then he and his wife, 
Gretchen, bought three brass elephants for hood ornaments. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why not put more on it," Steingold said after gazing at the elephants. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, all the ornaments are solid brass -- except for the Susan B. Anthony and 
Eisenhower dollars and Kennedy half dollars and quarters. 
</P>
<P>
 Steingold, who owns Dreese Vacuum store in Burbank, uses the van for 
deliveries and pickups. He also tries to find time to stop at the farmer's 
market, Mann's Chinese theater and Disneyland, where local residents and 
tourists react with awe, praise and sometimes scorn. 
</P>
<P>
 He's been asked for his autograph. One man walked up to him in a restaurant 
while he was eating and said: "I love your van out there. It's great and it 
would be an honor to buy you dinner." 
</P>
<P>
 When Steingold asked how the man knew it was his, the reply was, "You look 
like it would be yours." 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe this van is paying me back indirectly for all the work I've done on 
it," Steingold said. 
</P>
<P>
 The autograph requests and oohs and aahs also help ease the sting when he 
hears, "It's a piece of junk." 
</P>
<P>
 "It makes me feel so good that people enjoy it, but a few rotten apples will 
upset you," Steingold said. "I've learned never to let anybody see I'm upset 
because you never lower yourself. You've got to be a nice guy, because they 
won't forget the van and I want them to remember a good guy had the van." 
</P>
<P>
 And, Steingold said, the van is still a work in progress.  
</P>
<P>
 "It keeps on growing. It's a lifetime project," Steingold said. "I'm proud of 
it. It gives me a feeling I've done something in my life." SONDRA FARRELL

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: WOODLAND HILLS; WALKATHON TO BENEFIT PIERCE COLLEGE FARM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Pierce College officials hope to raise more than chicken feed at a July 4 
walkathon. It's goose feed they're really after. 
</P>
<P>
 The first such fund-raiser for the Pierce College farm will, among other 
things, help pay for the reseeding of pasture areas where each winter 
everything edible is gobbled up by hundreds of Canada geese that make Pierce 
their temporary home. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to make sure there is food, so the geese continue to land on the 
farm," Pierce President Mary Lee said. "It's a spectacular event to see all 
those geese landing and taking off and eating." 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, Pierce has reseeded the land at a cost of between $5,000 and 
$10,000, Lee said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 5K and 2K walks at 8:30 a.m. are expected to raise up to $7,000 for 
reseeding, repairs to barns and fences and the purchase of livestock. 
</P>
<P>
 It kicks off a daylong Independence Day celebration co-sponsored by the 
Woodland Hills Chamber of Commerce, which will include live music, food, games, 
recreational swimming and fireworks. 
</P>
<P>
 Those interested in participating in the walkathon should call (818) 719-6425 
to sign up. KURT PITZER

STREET BEAT: THE FIGHT AGAINST CRIME: NOTES FROM THE FRONT; OFFICER MAKES OWN 
MARK IN GRAFFITI BATTLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIMOTHY WILLIAMS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Detective Craig Rhudy used to drive to work an angry man. 
</P>
<P>
 It had nothing to do with his job, his home life or even the traffic jams on 
the Golden State Freeway. His anger stemmed from the scrawls of indecipherable 
graffiti visible along a good part of his route. 
</P>
<P>
 Tags were left on overpasses, on directional signs and on the walls of the 
liquor stores and factories that abutted the roadways heading from his Santa 
Clarita Valley home to the Los Angeles Police Department's Van Nuys station. 
</P>
<P>
 To say he disliked what he saw would be a massive understatement. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was on both sides of the street, on freeway off-ramps, everywhere," said 
Rhudy, 44. "It was just a frustrating thing. Maddening." 
</P>
<P>
 While one might not expect a 22-year veteran cop who has worked on murder 
cases, investigated sex crimes and served on the robbery detail to get too 
upset about something as banal as graffiti, Rhudy takes the random markings of 
today's youth personally. 
</P>
<P>
 "Graffiti vandalism is almost as serious a detractor for the quality of life 
as narcotics and prostitution activity," he said speaking in the clipped 
vernacular of a policeman, "because graffiti sets the scene for everything 
else. 
</P>
<P>
 "If criminals enter an area that is not well-maintained, they stay. They break 
into cars, deal drugs, there's prostitution and street crime. . . . If you were 
looking for an area to move into or open a business, you wouldn't move into a 
graffiti area." 
</P>
<P>
 So last May, Rhudy helped start the Community Tagger Task Force, a coalition 
of citizen volunteers, businesses and local law enforcement officials who 
report, catch and prosecute taggers in the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Their efforts have apparently paid off. Rhudy said 100 citizen volunteers who 
hunt for graffiti and the markings' authors are finding less to report. And 
last month, Rhudy won an award for his pet project, which has led to the 
successful prosecution of 15 taggers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Over the past six months, graffiti has decreased in the San Fernando Valley 
because of the task force," he said. "And there's been some good press 
coverage, so when the taggers read about (the prosecutions), they are afraid to 
tag. They don't want to get six months in a (juvenile offenders) camp, or 
probation." 
</P>
<P>
 Early on, Rhudy said, he realized that if he was going to have any luck in 
keeping kids from spray-painting walls, he would need to understand why they 
did it in the first place. So he immersed himself in a subculture where loosely 
knit tagging crews use monikers like "Under No Authority," "Unstoppable 
Criminals," "Mexicans Causing Panic," and "Every Woman's Fantasy." 
</P>
<P>
 What he found, he said, was an age-old problem: attention-starved youths, 
typically 13 to 17 years old. 
</P>
<P>
 "They do it for recognition and because of lack of attention by parents," said 
Rhudy, himself the father of two.  
</P>
<P>
 Taggers gain recognition from other taggers for being very prolific or for 
successfully placing their tags where they can be seen by many people -- for 
instance, on buses or freeway overpasses. 
</P>
<P>
 Rhudy said the task force is able to catch taggers after members of the public 
spot and then report graffiti to the police. Next, civilian volunteers take 
photos of the markings, fill out a police report and, finally, erase the 
offending message. Volunteers are told not to confront taggers, even if they 
catch them in the act. 
</P>
<P>
 For the most prolific taggers, a more serious step can be taken. Rhudy 
developed a data base of tagger names in 1990. If officers are able to use it 
to identify the people behind the tag, police can obtain a warrant to search 
their homes. 
</P>
<P>
 While most of the cases are circumstantial in the early stages, Rhudy said, 
there is often a preponderance of evidence in the homes of the suspects. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every search warrant so far has yielded evidence," he said. "Sometimes we get 
photos they take of themselves putting up graffiti, and in a couple of cases, 
they even had videotapes." 
</P>
<P>
 So while the war on graffiti is far from over, Rhudy said his commute is a 
happier one -- though certainly not totally graffiti-free. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's still a lot out there," he said. "We have more information than we 
have manpower to deal with it."

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE; ELECTION TO REPLACE ROGAN CANCELED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JENNIFER OLDHAM 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Although candidates vying for the Glendale Municipal Court Division 2 seat are 
still listed on the June 7 primary ballot, the election for the bench vacated 
by Judge James Rogan has been canceled. 
</P>
<P>
 Rogan surprised pundits when he defeated several challengers in a special 
election last month to assume the Assembly seat of former GOP leader Pat 
Nolan.Nolan is serving a 33-month prison term for racketeering. 
</P>
<P>
 Rogan announced his intention to leave the bench when he became an Assembly 
candidate. Based on that, five candidates stepped forward to vie for his 
judge's seat. After he won the Assembly race, he didn't officially resign until 
May 9, which was after the deadline for filing candidacy papers. His delay in 
resigning resulted in potential candidates for the seat being unable to file in 
time for the primary. 
</P>
<P>
 Voters will be able to choose a candidate to fill the Division 2 judgeship in 
the November general election. 
</P>
<P>
 Candidates running for the vacated seat, including Dona Bracke, Harvey 
Goldhammer, Steven Lubell, Bruce Mitchell and James Simpson, have been advised 
of the change, Ventura said. 
</P>
<P>
 Voters have not been notified by the registrar's office and will not receive a 
mailing announcing the cancellation of the election, Ventura said. The 
registrar is deciding whether to post a notice on June 7 at polling places 
announcing the change, she said. JENNIFER OLDHAM

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: CHATSWORTH; SCHOOL FITNESS PROGRAM FUNDED

<TEXT>
<P>
 A Chatsworth-based health maintenance company is putting up nearly $10,000 to 
fund a two-year fitness program at a Woodland Hills school. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten elementary, junior high and high schools are expected to apply for the 
program.The winner will be announced later this month. 
</P>
<P>
 CareAmerica Health Plans, which will move its headquarters to Woodland Hills 
later in June, is offering to buy outdoor fitness equipment, set up a 
cardiovascular-wellness curriculum and help with staff development at the 
school. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel that preventive care (for youngsters) is the key to healthy adults," 
CareAmerica spokeswoman Lisa Freeman said. The program, she added, is designed 
"to educate kids early about proper nutrition and exercise." 
</P>
<P>
 Under the umbrella of the nonprofit Project Fit America, CareAmerica will fund 
the project in Woodland Hills. The chosen school will serve as a two-year study 
model, Freeman said. Students' health and fitness levels will be tested when 
the program of exercise and education begins, she added, and then retested two 
years later in order to record any improvements. 
</P>
<P>
 Project Fit America, established in 1990, has 37,000 children in its programs 
nationwide, most of whom have seen dramatic improvements in fitness levels, its 
studies show. 
</P>
<P>
 Boys showed an 81% improvement in pullups after two years and a 25% 
improvement in a sit-reach exercise. Girlsshowed an 18% improvement in the mile 
run and 78% in arm exercises. ERIC SLATER

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: BURBANK; WAIVER SOUGHT BY SCHOOL ON CLASS SIZE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Seeking to avert a $71,000 fine, administrators at Ralph Waldo Emerson 
Elementary School have asked state education officials to waive a requirement 
that the average size of third-grade classes not exceed 32 pupils. 
</P>
<P>
 Emerson has averaged two students over the limit, said district officials, who 
are optimistic the state Department of Education will grant the waiver this 
month. 
</P>
<P>
 District officials contend the fines will be avoided because the state had 
been advised that the limit would be exceeded and the school had a good reason. 
</P>
<P>
 Emerson Principal Marilyn Ramsey said the school could have met the limit if 
grades were combined. For instance, the fourth-grade classes, which are 
smaller, could have been combined with the third-grade classes, bringing them 
to acceptable sizes. 
</P>
<P>
 But combining the classes would have made scheduling difficult, interfering 
with a "team-teaching concept" started at the school this year. Under the 
concept, teachers of the same grade level work together in drafting a 
curriculum. Combining the grades also might have lead to increased class sizes 
for kindergartners, who would have been joined with another grade, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not concerned we would have to pay the penalty on this," said Bob 
Fraser, the district's director of elementary education. 
</P>
<P>
 The Burbank school district maintains an average for all grade levels of 30.5 
students per class, Fraser said. ED BOND

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SHERMAN OAKS; 52-ACRE PARK WILL EXTEND WILDLIFE AREA

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Mountains Recreation and Conservation Authority recently purchased 52 
acres of parkland from a developer, which will be open to the public and will 
also extend a wildlife habitat area. 
</P>
<P>
 The authority and the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy will hold a ceremony 
to celebrate the land acquisition at 1 p.m. Sunday at the southern end of 
Alomar Drive in Sherman Oaks.Scheduled to appear are City Councilman Zev 
Yaroslavsky, conservancy Chairman Jerome C. Daniel and conservancy board member 
Ed Begley Jr. The public is welcome. 
</P>
<P>
 The newly acquired parkland, which will be called Longridge Canyon Park, is 
located north of Mulholland Drive, south of Valley Vista Boulevard, west of 
Longridge Avenue and east of Woodman Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're delighted," said Laura Plotkin, spokeswoman for the conservancy. "It's 
been a long battle between the threat of development and the desire of 
homeowners to keep this as open space. They fought large-scale development for 
many years in this area. We were happy that we were able to come in and protect 
this project." 
</P>
<P>
 The authority bought the property with a grant from the conservancy, which 
obtained funding from Proposition A. Proposition A money will also help to 
maintain the park. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents living in the area have fought to keep the property undeveloped for 
many years. Griffin Homes had received approval to build 19 homes on the 
property, which was known as Longridge Estates. The developer decided to sell 
the land due to financial problems, Plotkin said.  
</P>
<P>
 Plotkin said she believed the park will be officially open for public use on 
Sunday. KAY HWANGBO

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: VAN NUYS; PREACHER NOW KNOWS WHERE THE VALLEY IS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN DART 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Evangelist Luis Palau, a preacher who has led crusades in Poland, Taiwan, 
Phoenix and Fort Worth in recent years, said Tuesday that while planning the 
five-day San Fernando Valley crusade last year, which begins tonight, he and 
his aides described it as the "Hollywood-Burbank Crusade" because few people 
knew the location of the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the earthquake hit there was no need to say Hollywood-Burbank anymore," 
he quipped during a news conference at the crusade site, the Tom Bradley Field 
at Van Nuys' Birmingham High School. 
</P>
<P>
 Palau also confessed that he had early misgivings about trying to preach at a 
football field rather than in an enclosed arena. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wondered if anyone would come out to a football field," he said. But 
looking around at the stands that can seat 10,000 and a playing field that 
could accommodate an estimated 5,000 more, Palau said, "This is really nice -- 
like a junior college stadium." 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers hope that the more than 200 churches and religious ministries that 
have pledged support to the evangelistic crusade will turn out and bring 
friends, relatives and co-workers who may be only nominal Christians or somehow 
looking for answers from evangelical Christianity. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not a party for the already converted," Palau said. "In California 
there is more of a spiritual search than most people realize." 
</P>
<P>
 About 1,800 people have been trained as counselors to help people each night 
who "come forward" to commit their lives to Christ. The number of volunteer 
counselors is much higher than at previous Palau crusades, organizers said. 
</P>
<P>
 The crusade has attempted to appeal to younger adults with Saturday night's 
Christian rock concert and guest appearances on other nights by entertainers 
such as Smokey Robinson and Leon Patillo, former lead vocalist for the rock 
group Santana. 
</P>
<P>
 "Wouldn't it be wonderful if Madonna and Michael Jackson turned to Jesus?" 
Palau asked more than a dozen pastors who showed up at the news conference.

 The camera operator sets up a medium close-up shot with his video recorder as 
the cast of the music video reviews the choreography one last time. 
</P>
<P>
 Something has gone wrong with the lighting equipment, but sixth-grader Greg 
Nowlin, one of the technical directors for the production, has it all under 
control. Teacher Taffy Patton, who coordinated the music video project for Vena 
Avenue Elementary School's magnet program, stands back and smiles at her 
students who are dancing to loud rap music. 
</P>
<P>
 The effort is a school project of the '90s: A merging of music, dance and 
technology that combine a class from a gifted magnet elementary school with a 
class of developmentally disabled high schoolers. 
</P>
<P>
 Four years ago, Patton began working with Michael Monagan, a teacher at Widney 
High School for mentally and orthopedically disabled kids in South-Central Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The project: make a video together. 
</P>
<P>
 The students do it all by themselves -- write the music, choreograph the 
steps, film the production and edit the final take. 
</P>
<P>
 "Doctor, Doctor," Tuesday's video project, was shot in a bungalow at Vena's 
magnet school. It features a song about the fears disabled children experience 
when they go to a doctor's office. The musical track was written by the Widney 
students in Monagan's studio at the high school. There, Monagan and the 
students record the songs with a synthesizer and a sequencer, choreograph 
movements to the songs and then send those recordings to Patton's class. 
</P>
<P>
 The sixth-graders at Vena work on the production aspect of the video. They 
have learned techniques for lighting and sound design, video camera operation 
and technical direction. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea for the music video program came from an Arts & Entertainment show 
called "The Gifted Ones" about musical and art prodigies, which the magnet 
students watched. Patton assigned them a project to research "how much of such 
a gift is hard work and how much is what you're born with." 
</P>
<P>
 Hassan Massiri, age 11, who has become friends with a number of the Widney 
students, said, "I especially enjoy how they want to learn. They are really 
very smart." 
</P>
<P>
 Eighteen-year-old Shelly Goodhope, who will be graduating from Widney in 1997, 
said he found the experience "fun and dazzling," and has decided "to put the 
movies on hold and be a rock star instead." MAKI BECKER

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SHERMAN OAKS; WOMAN ACCUSED OF ATTACKING HUSBAND 
</P>

<P>
 A Sherman Oaks woman who went to prison for killing her first husband has been 
charged with injuring her current husband with scissors, authorities said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 In a criminal complaint filed Friday, prosecutors charged Beverly Miller with 
one felony count of corporal injury to a spouse. 
</P>
<P>
 Because she has a prior violent-felony conviction, the new charge would count 
as a "second strike" against Miller and would double any prison term she 
receives if convicted of the charge. With the second-strike provision, Miller 
faces a maximum prison term of eight years. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller, 56, was arrested Thursday after her husband, 58-year-old Gary Miller, 
wrote a letter seeking assistance from authorities because he was being abused 
by his wife, according to Deputy Dist. Atty. Robert L. Cohen. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Miller alleged that his wife attacked him Thursday, using a pair of 
scissors to inflict a 2-inch wound on his forehead. He also said his wife bit 
him under his right eye, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Beverly Miller was convicted of voluntary manslaughter in 1980 in the shooting 
death of her first husband, court records show. Miller was sentenced to eight 
years in state prison. 
</P>
<P>
 After being booked into jail last week in lieu of $50,000 bail, Miller was 
scheduled to be arraigned Tuesday in Van Nuys Municipal Court. But the hearing 
was delayed until June 22 because Miller was mistakenly released on her own 
recognizance, according to Deputy Dist. Atty. Mitchell J. Harris. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of action taken last week by Judge Leland B. Harris, Miller will again 
be taken into custody unless she can post $50,000 bail, prosecutors said. THOM

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: VAN NUYS; SALVATION ARMY SETS SMOKE-FREE POLICY 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In keeping with its history of combatting addictions, the Salvation Army has 
declared that starting today its 26 adult rehabilitation centers in 13 Western 
states, including two in the San Fernando Valley, will be smoke-free. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only will the clients in the rehabilitation program be prohibited from 
smoking in the facilities, they will be expected to be nicotine-free 
altogether, according to Paul Delaney, director of Salvation Army 
rehabilitation services in Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a health issue," said Delaney, noting that there are many instances in 
which a person will recover from drug or alcohol addiction, but end up dying 
from respiratory illnesses caused by smoking.  
</P>
<P>
 "People are saying it's about time we embraced it," Delaney said of the 
growing anti-smoking sentiment. 
</P>
<P>
 Stephan Hartt, administrator of the Van Nuys Adult Rehabilitation Center, said 
in a recent news release: "It is unconscionable to condone a habit more 
addictive than cocaine while helping men in the rehabilitation program overcome 
alcoholism and drug abuse." 
</P>
<P>
 Hartt said that the Van Nuys center began the new year with a policy that 
there would be no smoking within the rehabilitation facilities by anyone 
enrolled in its programs or on staff. 
</P>
<P>
 The response to the no-smoking policy has been mixed, Hartt said. "Some give 
up smoking, but some have had difficulty and left the program." 
</P>
<P>
 To help clients in the rehabilitation program break their smoking habits, the 
centers offer Nicotine Anonymous meetings and smoking cessation groups, as well 
as educational materials provided by the American Cancer Society. 
</P>
<P>
 The new no-smoking policy also applies to the Salvation Army's rehabilitation 
center in Canoga Park. MAKI BECKER

CANDIDATE PROPOSES CONSERVANCY ADOPT ENGLISH-ONLY POLICY; POLITICS: RICHARD 
SYBERT, A REPUBLICAN CONGRESSIONAL HOPEFUL, WANTS AGENCY TO STOP SPENDING FOR 
BILINGUAL PROGRAMS. SOME OFFICIALS ARE OUTRAGED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLOS V. LOZANO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Republican congressional candidate is proposing that the Santa Monica 
Mountains Conservancy adopt an English-only policy for its publications and 
programs, a proposal that has surprised and outraged some conservancy 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Sybert, a former senior aide to Gov. Pete Wilson and a candidate for 
the 24th Congressional District seat that includes Thousand Oaks, is a member 
of the conservancy board and will ask the panel to adopt the policy at its 
meeting Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to acquiring mountain property for parkland, the conservancy, a 
state agency, also provides funding for educational programs aimed at promoting 
park use. 
</P>
<P>
 Sybert, who was appointed to the conservancy by Wilson in December, said he 
wants the agency to stop spending taxpayer money on bilingual programs and to 
stop issuing grants to other organizations that do the same because he believes 
that it only promotes division. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think people's desire for diversity has gone too far," Sybert said. "We 
need to focus more on what unites us. And one of those things is the English 
language." 
</P>
<P>
 But some of Sybert's colleagues on the conservancy board said his proposal may 
be going too far. Speaking as chairman of the conservancy, Jerome C. Daniel 
said he supported Sybert's right to bring his plan before the 10-member panel 
for consideration. 
</P>
<P>
 However, from a personal standpoint, Daniel said he was outraged by what he 
viewed as Sybert's insensitivity to others. He said the conservancy spends a 
minimal amount of money on bilingual programs and yet is responsible for 
promoting park use to a vast audience, which includes a large Spanish-speaking 
population. 
</P>
<P>
 "This would be a tremendous disservice to a major part of our population," 
Daniel said. "How can we ignore the Spanish-speaking people of California? It's 
ludicrous. . . . If we can't spend a few dollars on them, then what the hell 
good are we?" 
</P>
<P>
 John C. Hisserich, another member of the conservancy, said he was particularly 
upset by Sybert's protest over the funding of a toll-free bilingual parks 
information number and plans to turn a state park office into a bilingual 
visitors center. 
</P>
<P>
 "It irked the hell out of me," said Hisserich, who wrote a two-page letter to 
Sybert stating that his proposal would only discourage public participation in 
parks programs. 
</P>
<P>
 In May, Sybert had expressed concerns about the $1,762 spent by the Mountains 
Recreation and Conservation Authority, an arm of the conservancy, for bilingual 
publications and services in connection with the Los Angeles River restoration 
project. 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter to Sybert, conservancy Director Joseph T. Edmiston said: "Because 
I am the responsible official authorizing this expenditure, I am prepared to 
personally reimburse the authority for the cost of these bilingual services 
should they be considered an improper use of public funds." 
</P>
<P>
 Edmiston, who is on vacation this week, could not be reached for comment. In 
his letter to Sybert, Hisserich said he too would be willing to pick up some of 
the costs for the bilingual publications associated with the river restoration 
project. 
</P>
<P>
 Some conservancy officials, who did not want their names used, said they 
believed that Sybert's proposal was politically motivated. Sybert is competing 
in Tuesday's Republican primary for the seat held by Rep. Anthony Beilenson 
(D-Woodland Hills). 
</P>
<P>
 But Sybert said "it was not my intent for this to cause any fireworks." He 
noted that his proposal was made public only after the conservancy's Monday 
agenda was published. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I had wanted to make this a public issue, I would have called a press 
conference," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sybert, whose wife Greta is originally from Brazil, said he strongly believes 
that to promote assimilation not only in California but throughout the United 
States, immigrants must be required to learn English. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think for the good of the country and the future success of immigrants 
themselves, they should make the effort to learn English," he said. "If they 
live here, that is how business is conducted and they better learn it." 
</P>
<P>
 As for his colleagues on the conservancy board, Sybert said he respects their 
views but added that he stands by his proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are no bad guys in this; there are no black hats," Sybert said. "It's a 
clash of policies. And reasonable people can disagree."

COUNCIL OKS $2-MILLION LOAN FOR PANORAMA CITY MALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HUGO MARTIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles City Council voted Tuesday to loan $2 million in federal funds 
to a partnership that plans to buy the site of a vacant department store in 
Panorama City and build a 95,000-square-foot shopping center. 
</P>
<P>
 At the request of Councilman Richard Alarcon, who represents Panorama City, 
the council voted to loan Panorama Towne Center Inc., a limited partnership, 
the funds to buy 6.5 acres at the site of a former Robinsons department store 
on Van Nuys Boulevard near Parthenia Street. 
</P>
<P>
 The money would come from the $60 million that the city requested last year 
from the U.S. Housing and Urban Development Department. Half of the money is 
designated for housing programs and half for economic development programs. 
</P>
<P>
 The Panorama Towne Center project would include a 53,000-square-foot 
Food-4-Less grocery store as the anchor of the mall, city officials said. The 
entire project would cost $9.7 million, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Alarcon praised the council's decision, noting that Panorama City has suffered 
from a dramatic economic slump. 
</P>
<P>
 "Panorama City is a community that's been in decline for the last several 
years," he said. "It's anticipated that the completion of this development will 
help jump-start other commercial activities in the area." 
</P>
<P>
 The Robinsons' store closed seven years ago, but the area took a bigger hit in 
1992 when the General Motors plant closed its doors in Panorama City, idling 
2,600 workers. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said the interest rate on the loan to the partnership will be 
about 1.5% higher than the interest HUD will charge the city. 
</P>
<P>
 But city officials who reviewed the partnership credentials said the group 
includes three couples who have successfully developed or managed other 
projects in the Valley and elsewhere in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The couples are Harry and Lillian Grossman, Areih and Felice Greenbaum, and 
Laurence and Maureen Eisenberg, according to an aide to Alarcon. 
</P>
<P>
 According to records with the secretary of state, the partnership's president 
is Maureen Eisenberg. Felice Greenbaum is the registered agent. 
</P>
<P>
 A representative of Panorama Towne Center Inc. could not be reached for 
comment.

FORMER USHER'S SUIT ACCUSES EMPLOYER OF RAPE; COURTS: YOUNG WOMAN ALLEGES THE 
THEATER MANAGER ASSAULTED HER, THEN FIRED HER WHEN SHE THREATENED TO TELL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A teen-age former theater usher has sued Cineplex Odeon Corp. and her 
ex-supervisor, alleging that he sexually harassed and raped her at the 
company's Universal City Cinemas, then fired her when she threatened to 
complain. 
</P>
<P>
 The young woman alleges in a lawsuit filed in Los Angeles Superior Court that 
George Webb, manager of the theaters, began telling her how "good her body was 
and how much he would like to see more of it" in October, 1992, just three 
weeks after she had been hired. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the lawsuit, the harassment escalated on Christmas Eve, 1992, 
after Webb summoned the woman and another employee into his office and showed 
them a gun. The suit alleges that he then called the woman alone to his office 
and began hugging and kissing her and later that same evening told her that 
wanted to "see her body." 
</P>
<P>
 At that point, the young woman tried to flee Webb's office, but he grabbed her 
and held her hands behind her body, ripped off her clothes and then brandished 
the gun he had shown her earlier, according to the lawsuit. Webb subsequently 
held her down and performed several sex acts on her, the suit alleges. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the lawsuit, on another occasion Webb grabbed the girl by her 
hair and raped her. 
</P>
<P>
 Webb said he would fire her if she told anyone, and did fire her last May when 
she threatened to complain after being repeatedly harassed, the suit contends. 
The suit did not say to whom she threatened to complain.  
</P>
<P>
 Webb could not be reached for comment Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 An unidentified detective at the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department said 
there is no record that the young woman who brought the lawsuit ever filed a 
criminal complaint against Webb with either the Sheriff's Department or the Los 
Angeles Police Department. Stephan Math, an attorney representing the young 
woman, declined to discuss the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Cineplex spokesman Howard Lichtman said his company has fired Webb and is 
discussing a possible settlement with the young woman's attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 The young woman is seeking an unspecified amount of general and punitive 
damages in her lawsuit, which alleges intentional infliction of emotional 
distress and violation of state sexual discrimination laws. 
</P>
<P>
 Cineplex Odeon has a detailed policy in place allowing employees to report 
sexual harassment to the company's highest officials, Lichtman said. 
</P>
<P>
 In her lawsuit, the young woman alleges that Cineplex had received other 
complaints of the same nature regarding Webb but chose to ignore them. Lichtman 
said his company is unaware of any other such complaints about Webb.

VALLEY BRIEFING: TARZANA PORTRAIT; THE URBAN JUNGLE'S 'NOVEL' COMMUNITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Home of the first swimming pool of the San Fernando Valley and the estate of 
Tarzan creator Edgar Rice Burroughs, Tarzana enjoys a wealth of history and 
enthusiasm for its community. 
</P>
<P>
 Once billed as the ideal place to raise rabbits, poultry and berries, the 
Tarzana of today features both calm and almost rural residential areas and a 
bustling shopping and dining zone along Ventura Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 Tarzana even had its own dairy once. Adohr Milk Farm used to be near Ventura 
Boulevard and Lindley Avenue. The dairy was started by Merritt Adamson and his 
wife, Rhoda (Adohr spelled backward). It moved to Camarillo in 1947. 
</P>
<P>
 Tarzanans are currently gearing up for their annual "Taste of Tarzana" 
festival on Sunday, where dining establishments from the down-home family 
eatery Market Broiler to the spicy, Southeast Asian restaurant Takzin Thai will 
be serving up samples of their cuisine at Tarzana Square, 18399 Ventura Blvd., 
from 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. A Brief History  
</P>
<P>
 In the beginning: Originally Chumash Indian territory, the Tarzana area became 
part of the vast San Fernando Mission lands in 1769 after Gaspar de Portola's 
landmark visit to the Valley. In the 1870s, the Los Angeles Farm Homestead 
Assn. purchased the southern half of the Valley. The property, which came to be 
a wheat field, changed hands for the next 40 years until Gen. Harrison Gray 
Otis in 1911, founder and publisher of the Los Angeles Times, bought 550 acres 
of the field. Otis named his new home Casa Mil Flores (House of a Thousand 
Flowers). 
</P>
<P>
 Tarzan's creator: Writer Edgar Rice Burroughs bought the lot in 1919 after 
Otis' death in 1917. On his estate he built, among other structures, what is 
considered the first swimming pool in the Valley. Burroughs wrote many of his 
Tarzan stories in a garage / writing room on the property. 
</P>
<P>
 Name change: When residents of the Tarzana area, then called Runnymede II, 
petitioned for a postal office in 1927, they voted the name be changed to 
Tarzana. Community Issues  
</P>
<P>
 Tarzana is currently looking toward giving its main drag, Ventura Boulevard, a 
face lift. Louise Frankel, who founded the Tarzana Property Owners Assn. in 
1962 and recently stepped down as its president, said she would like to see 
merchants along the street clean up Tarzana's image by not plastering their 
windows with signs and writing. "In order to make it safer, you have to make it 
look better," she said. "And the bigger the crowd, the safer it is." 
</P>
<P>
 Greg Nelson, current president of the association, is also an architect and is 
working on "Streetscapes," a beautification project. Nelson has plans to add 
more trees and has also proposed using brick paving and perpendicular street 
parking. 
</P>
<P>
 Tarzana suffered about $18 million in damage from the Northridge earthquake, 
according to a Times computer analysis. Although 17 buildings were declared 
unsafe, the losses were not as severe as in neighboring Woodland Hills and 
Reseda, which had $20 million and $36 million in damage, respectively. 
Burroughs' Legacy  
</P>
<P>
 The estate: All that remains of the Burroughs estate are the swimming pool, a 
few fish ponds and a gatehouse that was badly damaged in the Jan. 17 quake. The 
ruins are on top of the hill at Tarzana Drive and Reseda Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 Burroughs' grave: Burroughs and his mother's ashes are buried in front of the 
current headquarters of Edgar Rice Burroughs Inc. at 18354 Ventura Blvd. by a 
black walnut tree.  
</P>
<P>
 Tarzan memorabilia: A permanent exhibit of Tarzan posters, T-shirts and other 
knickknacks can be found at the Bank of America across the street from the 
Burroughs Inc. office.

a retired fire captain, and Zev Yaroslavsky, a Los Angeles city councilman, 
spent their Memorial Day weekend toiling at either illegally posting political 
signs or illegally tearing them down. 
</P>
<P>
 The salvos of complaints from Wallace and Yaroslavsky, both contenders for a 
seat on the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors, began with a criminal 
complaint filed by Wallace with the Los Angeles Police Department, accusing 
Yaroslavsky of personally stealing some of Wallace's signs from a busy 
intersection near the Ventura Freeway and Topanga Canyon Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the artifacts in the complaint: a candid color photo of a 
rumpled-looking Yaroslavsky, his shirttail out and sleeves rolled up. 
</P>
<P>
 This photo was purportedly taken by a Chatsworth couple moments after they say 
they spotted Yaroslavsky removing several Wallace signs next to the Ventura 
Freeway in Woodland Hills and confronted him. 
</P>
<P>
 "We took the photo and Zev said, 'Oh, Jesus,' " said Matt Leigh, a mechanic 
for the city of Los Angeles who said he took the photo about 7:30 p.m. Sunday 
while driving with his family on Topanga Canyon Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier, Leigh said that he and his wife -- whose mother is a Wallace 
supporter -- spotted Yaroslavsky carrying one of Wallace's orange signs, 
stopped in their car and questioned Yaroslavsky about what he was doing. "He 
said the signs were illegal," Leigh said. "But he wouldn't tell us his name." 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Castille, Wallace's campaign manager, who believes the flap may dent 
Yaroslavsky's big lead in the race, has seen political sign wars before. But 
this one -- with Yaroslavsky allegedly in the trenches himself -- takes the 
cake. "It's as if Richard Nixon himself put on a trench coat and went out to 
commit the Watergate break-in," Castille rhapsodized. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm shocked and disappointed that Zev can't find time to debate me . . . but 
he can find time to tear down my signs," Wallace fumed. "It's pettiness and a 
crime against democracy." 
</P>
<P>
 Yaroslavsky, who has raised almost $1 million for his campaign and is widely 
viewed as a shoo-in to win the seat now held by retiring Supervisor Ed Edelman, 
has been reluctant to debate Wallace.  
</P>
<P>
 In his police complaint, Wallace said his campaign has been bedeviled in 
recent days by the loss of 150 to 200 of its lawn signs. 
</P>
<P>
 But the situation is not as simple as Wallace has maintained, said Kevin 
Acebo, Yaroslavsky's campaign manager. Acebo conceded his boss took two of 
Wallace's signs -- not as an act of political sabotage but to gather evidence 
for a complaint of his own. 
</P>
<P>
 That complaint, filed Tuesday with Caltrans and the city's Bureau of Street 
Maintenance, alleged that Wallace had illegally placed the disputed signs and 
hundreds of others either on public property or on private property without the 
consent of the owners. "The signs are illegal," Acebo said. 
</P>
<P>
 Yaroslavsky did not return phone calls asking for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 But his campaign office made available copies of complaints he filed asking 
Caltrans and the city street bureau to remove the allegedly illegal Wallace 
signs in their rights-of-way. The request to the bureau asked that it take 
steps to force Wallace to reimburse the city for the removal cost. 
</P>
<P>
 The Yaroslavsky campaign has also asked the state Fair Political Practices 
Commission to determine if Wallace violated state law by not placing a 
statement on his signs identifying what political committee paid for them. 
</P>
<P>
 Wallace knows all about the signs Yaroslavsky is alleged to have removed -- 
because the candidate, strapped for money and help, put them up himself last 
Saturday, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 And, Wallace admitted, he did not get the permission of Bank of America to 
place a sign at its Woodland Hills branch office at Topanga Canyon Boulevard 
last Saturday. "How could I have?" he asked. "They were closed." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, Wallace argued, although Yaroslavsky said he was concerned the signs 
were an eyesore or perhaps illegal, he removed only Wallace's signs and not 
those of four other candidates, also tacked up on the same pole in the Bank of 
America parking lot.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; CASTAIC UNION DISTRICT SUPERINTENDENT QUITS TO 
TAKE NEW JOB; EDUCATION: SCOTT BROWN, WHOSE REIGN WAS STORMY AT TIMES, WILL 
HEAD LARGER DISTRICT IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. 
</P>

<P>
 Scott Brown will end a sometimes stormy reign as superintendent of the Castaic 
Union School District by resigning June 30 to accept a position at a larger 
school district in Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown was selected from 34 candidates to be superintendent of Martinez Unified 
School District in the east San Francisco Bay Area. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown, 46, said his resignation has nothing to do with his admitted "bad 
judgment" in using a school district credit card for about $1,200 in personal 
expenses, including baby clothing at Nordstrom and restaurant and hotel bills 
in Seattle and San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the matter was so controversial in Castaic that it became an issue 
among school board candidates in last November's election, Brown's new 
employers seemingly did not know about it. 
</P>
<P>
 Alice Bonner, a trustee with the Martinez Unified School District, said 18 
Castaic officials -- including trustees and teachers -- were interviewed about 
Brown but none mentioned the credit card incident. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think all we heard was that there was dissension among the board," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez school board President Nancy Hobert said the incident was also news 
to her. 
</P>
<P>
 Did Hobert think Brown's appointment to the $91,000-a-year post would be 
reconsidered? 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think so," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles County Office of Education took no action against Brown over 
the credit card charges other than ordering him to stop using the card for 
personal expenses. District officials later canceled the card in what it called 
an unrelated action. Brown reimbursed the district for the personal charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Castaic board member Irene Massey, who was one of Brown's supporters, said the 
uproar over the charges was blown out of proportion by Brown's detractors on 
the board. 
</P>
<P>
 Board President Lester Freeman, who was often at odds with Brown, could not be 
reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Massey admitted that the bickering over Brown and his policies often curtailed 
school business. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would say that for the last year and a half prior to the election we didn't 
accomplish a lot," she said. "I give (Brown) credit for sticking it out because 
I know a lot of people who would bail." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown became superintendent of the Castaic district in 1988. He said the most 
important accomplishment of his tenure was acquiring four new school sites and 
securing $37 million to build schools, including Castaic Middle School, 
scheduled to open in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 He was selected as the new superintendent for the Oak Park Unified School 
District in Ventura County in November, 1992, but was unable to come to a 
contract agreement with the district. 
</P>
<P>
 His new district has about 3,800 students compared with about 1,700 students 
in the Castaic district. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's definitely a step up professionally," he said. "Personally, I 
grew up in Redding, my family lives in Northern California, my kids go to 
college (up there), so there's a personal appeal from my standpoint." 
</P>
<P>
 Trustees with the Castaic district will discuss candidates for a new 
superintendent during a closed session at their board meeting tonight. Massey 
said the district has some specific candidates in mind, but declined to name 
them.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; $50,000 IN JEWELRY TAKEN IN HOLDUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nine people were held at gunpoint Tuesday afternoon during the robbery of 
about $50,000 worth of merchandise from a jewelry store, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 No one was injured in the holdup, which took place just after noon at 
aPalmdale Jewelry Mart, 2728 E. Palmdale Blvd., said Los Angeles Sheriff's Sgt. 
Bob Denham. 
</P>
<P>
 Denham said a man, armed with a semiautomatic pistol, and his female partner, 
both in their 20s, entered the store and threatened employees and customers 
while gathering up the jewelry. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know it was a substantial amount -- over $50,000 worth," Denham said. 
</P>
<P>
 The two robbers fled from the store in an unknown direction. No getaway car 
was seen, Denham said.

 Brian Gruhlke was trying to get his pickup truck unstuck from a desolate field 
just after midnight Monday when a blinding light suddenly focused on him from 
out of the sky. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearer and nearer it came until it landed in the field nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 But this was no close encounter. It was a sheriff's deputy in a helicopter who 
gave him a ticket for trespassing on the field. 
</P>
<P>
 "Actually, I was a little bit surprised," Gruhlke said.  
</P>
<P>
 Gruhlke, 20, who lives in Valencia and works at a Pizza Hut, said he had taken 
a friend for a joy ridethrough a large field at the east end of Rye Canyon 
Road, near the site of the new Valencia High School. 
</P>
<P>
 But after making a partial circle around the field, the 1988 Toyota pickup 
sunk into the dirt. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Mark Cohen, an observation deputy for the helicopter at the Santa 
Clarita Valley Sheriff's Station, spotted the truck at about 12:30 a.m. Tuesday 
and asked pilot David L'Hureux to land. Cohen said he was worried that the 
plowed field, owned by the Newhall Land and Farming Co., might be planted with 
seeds. 
</P>
<P>
 Cohen disembarked from the helicopter and asked Gruhlke if he needed help with 
the truck. Gruhlke said no, and then Cohen gave him a misdemeanor citation for 
trespassing. 
</P>
<P>
 Gruhlke said he did not know the field was privately owned. 
</P>
<P>
 Cohen said the station's helicopter is used primarily for emergencies and to 
patrol remote areas of the Santa Clarita and Antelope valleys. But it has been 
useful for spotting people driving illegally in off-road areas, he said, and 
for spotting people getting too close to flooded rivers following a storm or 
acting suspiciously in areas where brush fires could be set. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're out there not to give these people tickets because we like to, but 
because we're trying to prevent stuff," Cohen said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gruhlke isn't sure all that extra effort is worthwhile. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems to me that they have nothing better to do than harass young people, 
when there's (more serious crimes) going on in other parts," he said.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; FUGITIVE CHARGED WITH MURDER IN EXPLOSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Murder charges were filed Tuesday against a fugitive parolee being sought in 
the killing of Lynn Standish, the Pearblossom woman who died last month in an 
explosion that also seriously injured her young son. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Douglas Hamby, 31, has been charged with murder with the special 
circumstance of death by an explosive device, which means if convicted he could 
face the death penalty, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hamby was also charged with a count of possessing an explosive device and two 
counts of exploding a destructive device causing injury. 
</P>
<P>
 He is believed to have manufactured the bomb that killed Standish, 33, a 
single mother of three, who died May 20 when she discovered a pipe bomb while 
hunting for recyclable goods in the desert near her Pearblossom home. 
</P>
<P>
 Standish's 4-year-old son suffered leg injuries in the same explosion and is 
expected to undergo surgery. His 9-year-old brother escaped injury. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time of the fatal blast, Hamby was being sought on an arrest warrant 
for violating his parole in an unrelated criminal matter, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 A separate warrant has been issued for Hamby's arrest in connection with the 
murder charges, according to Deputy Dist. Atty. John Spillane. 
</P>
<P>
 Hamby is described as a white male, 5 feet, 9 inches tall, with brown hair, 
blue eyes, a mustache and weighing about 180 pounds. He has a tattoo of a rose 
on one shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
 Spillane said the investigation is ongoing but so far Hamby has been 
identified as the lone suspect in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 It remains unclear whether Hamby intentionally left the device or simply 
discarded it along the dirt road near 106th Street, authorities said. Evidence 
discovered at the scene linked him to the crime, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities have described Hamby as a parolee with a history of manufacturing 
and possessing explosive devices and as "extremely dangerous." 
</P>
<P>
 He was arrested in 1989 on criminal conspiracy charges and again in 1992 for 
drug use and firearms violations and for possessing ammunition while a parolee, 
said Rosario F. Santillan, the supervisor of the Antelope Valley Parole Unit. 
</P>
<P>
 Following his arrest in 1992 Hamby was returned to prison and released in 
December of the same year. 
</P>
<P>
 "He continued to use drugs, and on Aug. 23, 1993, we suspended his parole and 
requested a warrant for his arrest," Santillan said. "He became a parolee at 
large." Santillan said authorities made several attempts to find Hamby since 
then, but were unsuccessful.

FIRST PENSION INVESTORS HEAR MORE BAD NEWS; BANKRUPTCY: TRUSTEE TELLS RAUCOUS 
MEETING THAT PRINCIPALS ARE NOT COOPERATING. ONLY 30% OF FUNDS IN DENVER TRUST 
LOCATED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 In a raucous session punctuated by angry outbursts, about 150 investors in 
failed First Pension Corp. packed a U.S. Bankruptcy Court hearing room here 
Tuesday to demand that officials tell them where their money went. 
</P>
<P>
 The investors received little satisfaction. Trustee James Joseph could report 
only that a new administrator may take over the accounts of the Irvine pension 
management firm. 
</P>
<P>
 A court-appointed overseer of Denver-based Summit Trust Services, a company 
created to handle the funds invested by First Pension's clients, told investors 
that only about $9 million, or less than 30% of an estimated $32 million in its 
care, could be located. 
</P>
<P>
 The main purpose of Tuesday's hearing had been to question the company's top 
executives under oath. But none of the three principals -- William E. Cooper, 
Robert E. Lindley and Valerie Jensen -- attended. 
</P>
<P>
 "You've read that the principals are cooperating, but I can tell you they are 
not cooperating with me, despite numerous requests, and they will not talk to 
me," said Joseph, who was interrupted frequently by questions shouted at him 
from the assembled investors and creditors. "Our knowledge is limited because 
people who know the story aren't telling it." 
</P>
<P>
 The Securities and Exchange Commission alleges that First Pension's owners 
operated an elaborate pyramid scheme, leading clients to invest in mortgages 
that did not exist. As much as $124 million of 8,000 investors' money may have 
been lost to fraud and outright theft, investigators say. In all, First Pension 
had accounts once valued at about $350 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Joseph said he is in discussions with California Central Trust Bank, a Costa 
Mesa trust company known as Cal-Trust that has about $155.7 million in assets, 
to become custodian of the First Pension accounts. 
</P>
<P>
 That news, however, did little to ease investors' concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of those in court Tuesday, especially those who invested in second trust 
deed mortgage pools operated by First Pension's parent company, First 
Diversified Financial Services Inc. in Irvine, went away angry and frustrated. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't get a single answer today," said Mary Ann Newfield of Hollywood, who 
said she had invested $120,000 in pension money and an inheritance through 
First Diversified.  
</P>
<P>
 "I feel sick," said Newfield, who is unemployed. "I just want to get out a 
razor blade. This is all the money I've scrimped and saved in the world." 
</P>
<P>
 Investor James Desselle, 69, said he and 20 other investors in the allegedly 
fraudulent mortgage pools expect to hire an attorney to represent them in a 
joint lawsuit. Desselle said the attorney wants to charge him 4% of his 
original investment and an additional 30% of what is recovered. 
</P>
<P>
 Desselle, who had $90,000 invested in the mortgage pools, said he is now 
living on social security, which is about $900 a month. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've decided to get our own attorney. We're all retirees and we need this 
money," Desselle said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some investors had flown in from as far way as Northern California, Arizona 
and Colorado. Patricia Wuertzer traveled from Seattle to determine what 
happened to $45,000 she had in a self-directed IRA. 
</P>
<P>
 "At this point I am just puzzled," Wuertzer said. "I just want to get some 
answers." 
</P>
<P>
 First Pension filed Chapter 7 bankruptcy on April 22, just as many of its 
investors discovered that substantial sums were missing from their accounts. 
The day before the filing, Colorado banking regulators had seized Summit Trust 
Services.  
</P>
<P>
 Andrew C. Snyder, trustee for Summit, came to the hearing to ease investors' 
concerns. He asked investors to remain patient, telling those who had not put 
money into the mortgage pools that he would try to assist those who wanted 
changes in their accounts. 
</P>
<P>
 "If people wish to conduct business on those accounts, we will try to conduct 
business on those accounts," Snyder said, adding that he did not want to be 
deluged with transfer requests since he had a very small staff of employees. He 
suggested investors continue to contact him by mail. 
</P>
<P>
 Snyder said Summit held both a financial institution bond to cover up to $1 
million in forgery and theft claims, and a $1-million policy to cover liability 
claims against the company's directors and officers. But investors who asked 
about those policies Tuesday were told it was still unclear who the 
beneficiaries would be. 
</P>
<P>
 A second bankruptcy court hearing is slated for June 28.

U.S. ALLEGES OVERCHARGING BY KOLL SUBSIDIARIES; AUDITS: COMPANY DISPUTES RTC 
FINDINGS THAT IT OVERBILLED THE GOVERNMENT BY MORE THAN $1 MILLION FOR MANAGING 
BUILDINGS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Federal regulators allege that three Koll Co. subsidiaries overcharged the 
government $1.265 million in connection with its contracts to manage two office 
buildings in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 In recently completed audits, the Resolution Trust Corp.'s Office of the 
Inspector General alleged that Koll affiliates overcharged the federal 
government $649,000 for managing 12-story office buildings at 1920 Main St. and 
1010 Main St. in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 A second audit alleges that Koll affiliates overcharged the federal government 
$616,000 in connection with management of a 14-story office building at 500 N. 
State College Blvd. in Orange. 
</P>
<P>
 In both cases, the alleged overcharges occurred in the late 1980s and early 
1990s. The disputed charges occurred at buildings that fell under RTC control 
after Columbia Savings & Loan Assn.'s 1991 failure. Columbia and Koll acted as 
partners in the real estate development projects and federal regulators kept 
Koll on to manage the buildings after Columbia was seized. 
</P>
<P>
 The audits allege that Koll used office space without paying rent, awarded 
questionable bonuses to employees -- including one bonus that was nearly three 
times an employee's base salary -- and charged the government for "questionable 
tenant improvement expenses." 
</P>
<P>
 "We disagree with the findings of the RTC, and we've communicated that in 
writing to them," Koll spokeswoman Linda Lane said Tuesday. "We're working 
within the RTC process to resolve the differences." 
</P>
<P>
 Lane declined to comment on specific issues raised by the audits. "The Koll 
Co. does not believe it is in our best interests to talk about them at this 
time," Lane said.  
</P>
<P>
 However, the audits show that executives at Koll's various operating units had 
earlier rejected charges of impropriety. Koll executives maintained that "its 
charging practice was consistent with the (RTC) management agreement," 
according to the audits. 
</P>
<P>
 The RTC report links the overcharges to billings generated by Koll Management 
Services, Koll Construction Co. and Koll Co./Development Group at the RTC-owned 
properties in Irvine and Orange. The RTC's Inspector General is recommending 
that Koll's subsidiaries refund $1.265 million to the RTC and building tenants. 
</P>
<P>
 The audits allege that Koll "did not adequately control costs" and that it 
subsequently overcharged the federal government for its services. According to 
the audits, Koll executives responded to the Inspector General's report this 
spring by maintaining that its services and charges were appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
 RTC investigators issued a report on the Irvine building in March. The second 
audit was initiated because results of the Irvine audit "showed that Koll . . . 
had allowed significant questioned costs to be charged" to the RTC and building 
tenants.

 At least 12 big-name home builders -- including the Presley Cos., Costain 
Homes and Kaufman & Broad -- are reportedly bidding to buy a portion of 100 
acres that make up the first phase of Northwood Point, the Irvine Co.'s newest 
planned community in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 There will be about 700 single-family detached homes in the first phase of 
Northwood, which will be north of Interstate 5 at Culver Drive just north of 
Irvine Boulevard, an Irvine Co. spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a very favorable location, especially with the opening of the Foothill 
corridor toll road. This will continue to push real estate values upward in all 
the areas that it serves," said Robert McFarland, senior vice president with 
Market Profiles, a real estate consulting firm in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 The Irvine Co. is reviewing the offers and is expected to announce the winning 
bidders this week.

YAMAHA HOPES SILENCE IS GOLDEN; PIANO WITH HEADPHONES ENSURES EASY LISTENING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 At last, there is some relief for the ears -- and nerves -- of those who must 
live with beginning piano students. 
</P>
<P>
 Yamaha Corp. of America will introduce today its Silent Series piano, a hybrid 
of regular piano and electronic keyboard that can plug into headphones. 
</P>
<P>
 The Buena Park company, a subsidiary of Japan's Yamaha Corp., developed the 
silent piano so that would-be musicians can practice at any time of the day or 
night without disturbing sleepers or couch potatoes. 
</P>
<P>
 "It allows Dad to watch 'Monday Night Football' and still ask the kids to 
practice," said Carter Schuld, marketing manager for Yamaha. "This has been a 
real problem. It gets a little tedious listening to someone practice scales." 
</P>
<P>
 The piano uses a patented QuieTouch system that, when activated, prevents the 
piano hammers from hitting the strings at the last moment. Instead, sensors 
capture the motions and store them in computer memory. The computer can then 
reproduce the sounds electronically and pipe them into the headphones. The 
instrument can also be played just like a regular piano. 
</P>
<P>
 The product, which will be available for $8,395 at regular piano sales 
outlets, builds on Yamaha's line of electronic pianos, which started in 1988 
with a player-piano version known as a Disklavier. 
</P>
<P>
 "Piano sales have been declining, but we're adding to what the piano can 
offer," Schuld said. 
</P>
<P>
 Larry Fine, a Boston resident and author of the Piano Book, a consumers guide 
to pianos, said he thinks the Silent Series technology is the key to the future 
of the piano, which in recent years has lost sales to digital keyboards. 
</P>
<P>
 "This silent piano sounds and feels like a piano because it is a piano," he 
said. "Most digital keyboards don't sound like pianos." 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Majeski, publisher of Music Trades magazine in Englewood, N.J., said the 
Silent Series was an enormous success when it was introduced in the Japanese 
market last year. That is because, with that nation's typical high-density 
housing, shielding neighbors from noise isn't easy. 
</P>
<P>
 In the United States, Majeski said, the company might not get the same 
reception except in heavily populated areas where people have to worry about 
not annoying their neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an open question as to whether this can arrest the decline of piano 
stores in the United States," Majeski said. 
</P>
<P>
 Schuld at Yamaha conceded that piano sales have been declining but said, 
"We're adding to what the piano can offer." Yamaha's Latest Instrument 
</P>

WESTERN DIGITAL, SANYO TO DEVELOP CD-ROM CHIP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WOODYARD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Western Digital Corp. said Tuesday that it has entered into a strategic 
relationship with Sanyo Electric Co. to develop a semiconductor chip that would 
make it easier to connect a CD-ROM player to a personal computer. 
</P>
<P>
 The deal, announced in Tokyo, will have the two companies working together in 
creating the chip for CD-ROMs, one of the fastest-growing segments of the 
peripheral market.The players hold compact discs that can hold far more data 
than conventional hard or floppy disk drives for personal computers. 
</P>
<P>
 Western Digital in Irvine designs computer chips while Sanyo is one of the 
world's largest makers of CD-ROM systems. Once the chip is developed, it could 
be sold to other makers of CD-ROMs as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's win-win for both companies," said Gary Marks, Western Digital vice 
president, although no financial details of the arrangement were released. 
</P>
<P>
 At present, connecting a CD-ROM to a personal computer can be a time-consuming 
task involving wiring and plugs, differing between the various makers of 
personal computers. 
</P>
<P>
 The Western Digital-Sanyo linkup would create a single 40-pin plug similar to 
ones that hook up other peripheral devices like electronic printers. Not only 
would the connection be easier, Marks said, but it could become the standard of 
the industry if it is widely adopted by other makers.

 Renting in Seal Beach: Seal Beach has the highest average apartment rents in 
Orange County, with rates up 18.8% from last year, according to the Research 
Network Ltd., a real estate consulting firm in Laguna Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Rent averages $1,319 per month for a Laguna Hills apartment compared to $1,110 
for apartments in the previous year.Laguna Hills is followed by Newport Beach, 
Irvine, Yorba Linda, and Dana Point as the costliest places to rent apartments. 
</P>
<P>
 "The southern Orange County region shows a trend of getting healthier with 
occupancy and rent rates going up there," said Pam Woolridge, president of 
Research Network.  
</P>
<P>
 The cheapest place to rent an apartment is Tustin, where an average apartment 
is $695 per month, compared to $714 in 1993, followed by Anaheim, Buena Park 
and Fullerton. The city with the highest occupancy rate in the county is Brea 
with 99.1%, which means fewer than 1% of that city's apartments were available 
for rent, followed by Mission Viejo and Fountain Valley. Los Alamitos had the 
lowest occupancy rate at 87.5%.

 Foreclosures Go Up: Orange County housing foreclosures jumped 11.1% during the 
first four months of this year compared to the same period last year, according 
to Dataquick Information Systems. 
</P>
<P>
 An estimated 3,108 homes in Orange County were foreclosed on during that time, 
compared to 2,797 homes the previous year, Dataquick said.The Southern 
California region had an 8% increase in foreclosures during the first four 
months, while Los Angeles County showed a 6.8% increase. 
</P>
<P>
 "Foreclosure activity is a so-called lagging indicator and what we're seeing 
here is year-old distress. Most lenders try to work things out with their 
borrowers and wait as long as they can before they start the formal foreclosure 
process," said Donald L. Cohn, chief executive of Dataquick in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 The state's foreclosure problem is still most severe in Southern California, 
Dataquick found, especially in Riverside, San Bernardino, Orange and Los 
Angeles counties.

 Mediation Service Created: Several business people have created a new 
mediation service that will specialize in solving real estate disputes, such as 
shoddy construction or contract disputes.The founders say they are poised to 
capitalize on a state bill that, if passed, would require a certain portion of 
real estate disputes to be solved by arbitration rather than by costly 
lawsuits.  
</P>
<P>
 The founders are: James T. Capretz, a Newport Beach attorney, William Cote, a 
luxury real estate broker in Newport Beach and Joseph Di Mento, a former 
assistant vice chancellor at UC Irvine. They have formed Real Estate 
Arbitration & Mediation Services in Newport Beach.

 SensorMedics: The maker of products for respiratory care has filed a lawsuit 
claiming that a competitor is infringing on its patent for a "breath-by-breath" 
analysis process. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit, which was filed Friday in federal court in Minnesota, responds to 
an earlier claim by Medical Graphics Corp. that it holds a patent it says 
SensorMedics is infringing. Yorba Linda-based SensorMedics has also alleged 
that Medical Graphics Corp. of St. Paul, Minn., is participating in deceptive 
trade practices and unfair competition.

ORANGE COUNTY BRIEFLY: 4 ACCUSED OF TURNING BACK USED-CAR ODOMETERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Four Orange County men have been charged with criminal conspiracy and grand 
theft for allegedly participating in a scheme to set back odometers on used 
cars, the district attorney's office said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Twelve charges were filed by the district attorney's office based on an 
investigation by the Department of Motor Vehicles at Europe Auto Sales. Those 
charged are Phuoc Hong Pham, 28; Tuyet Kim Le, 43, and Minh Lac Au, 49, all of 
Westminster, and Dung Kim Le, 52, of Midway City.

RENO AIR IS CLOSER TO CHALLENGING SOUTHWEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WOODYARD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A week after Southwest Airlines ushered in a new era of lower fares at John 
Wayne Airport, another low-cost, no-frills carrier is poised on the runway. 
</P>
<P>
 Reno Air, an upstart Nevada-based airline that has grown quickly since 1992, 
wants to operate an unspecified number of American Airline's flight slots from 
the Orange County airport. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Reno Air has been denied access to the airport in the past because 
not enough landing slots were available, the joint operation plan with American 
has won the blessings of Airport Director Jan Mittermeier. 
</P>
<P>
 "The county does wish to encourage broad-based competitive air service," 
Mittermeier wrote in a letter to the airline's lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
 Mittermeier, who is asking the Airport Commission to approve the cooperative 
operating deal at its meeting tonight, said she approves only with a hefty set 
of restrictions, such as limiting Reno Air to six daily round-trip flights. She 
also wants to try out the joint operation through September. 
</P>
<P>
 The joint arrangement could benefit both airlines. Reno Air would feed 
passengers into American's profitable long-range flights. In return, Reno Air 
would benefit from its existing program of crediting its passengers through 
American Airlines' frequent-flier program. 
</P>
<P>
 Reno Air has not outlined how many flights or what destinations it has in 
mind. The airline flies to various cities in the West, including Los Angeles 
International Airport. A Reno Air spokesman offered no substantive comment on 
the airline's plans, and American Airlines officials could not be reached for 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
 But commission documents indicate that Reno Air plans to fly some or all of 
American's flights from Orange County to San Jose. Reno Air, with its low-cost 
structure and one-way fares of $72 to San Jose, would have a better chance of 
competing against Southwest. 
</P>
<P>
 Southwest started flying eight round trips daily to San Jose and seven daily 
to Oakland with an everyday fare of $69 each way. American was charging up to 
$140 one way on the San Jose flights. It has since matched Southwest's fare.

 Boob Job!!!Who were the boobs who made the opportunistic decision to rerun 
"Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy" last week, as if Jaclyn Smith's portrayal of the 
real Jackie Kennedy in this inept 1981 television production captured the 
essence of the charismatic woman whose death launched a thousand eulogies and 
retrospectives? 
</P>
<P>
 Who? The boobs at KTLA-TV Channel 5. 
</P>
<P>
 And speaking of blatant opportunism -- to say nothing of unlabeled 
commercialism -- coming next Wednesday night on CBS is "A Busch Gardens/Sea 
World Celebration," an hourlong summer vacation tip being produced for the 
Anheuser Busch Theme Parks. It has the same taint as "Treasure Island," an 
alleged children's special set in the new Treasure Island park at the Treasure 
Island Hotel in Las Vegas. The hotel's parent firm, Mirage Resorts, was the 
sponsor of this NBC hour last January. 
</P>
<P>
 Continuing on this grimy path, ABC's June 15 special, "The Lion King: The 
Musical Special With Elton John," is produced by the Wrightwood Group in 
association with Disney Television. John wrote the music and Tim Rice the 
lyrics for "The Lion King," an animated movie from Disney that opens in New 
York and Los Angeles June 15, the same day as the TV special and three days 
after the June 12 premiere of "The Making of 'The Lion King' " on the Disney 
Channel. This "documentary" has three additional airdates this month.  
</P>
<P>
 And oh yes, tonight finds CBS airing "Movie News Hot Summer Sneak Preview," a 
program that profiles/promotes four coming Disney films. And what a 
coincidence! It was produced by Disney's Buena Vista Pictures in association 
with the Wrightwood Group. 
</P>
<P>
 Exclusive to Me!!!Where are some of L.A.'s most prominent journalists now? 
</P>
<P>
 "Another job well done by professional firefighters. . . ." A familiar face 
and voice? Yes, standing in front of some sort of emergency vehicle, it's none 
other than Alex Paen, former foreign affairs specialist for KABC-TV Channel 7's 
"Eyewitness News," now displaying just as much authority and credibility as 
host of the syndicated "reality" series "Emergency Call." 
</P>
<P>
 And he's still a traveling man. Paen: "This next emergency takes us to 
Baltimore. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, who was that familiar figure checking in from Burbank for the 
notorious tabloid series "Hard Copy"? 
</P>
<P>
 "Thank you, Jodi," said anchor Terry Murphy to the reporter who had just 
finished a stand-up, former KCBS-TV Channel 2 "Action News" reporter Jodi 
Baskerville. 
</P>
<P>
 Shocking Truth!!!Which local news reporter was horrified recently to learn the 
truth about her own business? Are you ready? None other than Pat Lalama, 
subbing this week for Linda Alvarez on the KCBS morning news. 
</P>
<P>
 When entertainment reporter David Sheehan made his video pick of the week 
"Broadcast News" -- the James L. Brooks movie that satirizes the sham aspects 
of TV news -- Lalama replied that she'd just seen the 1987 movie herself. 
</P>
<P>
 Poor woman. You could read the disillusionment on her face when she said to 
co-anchor Brad Goode: "It's a sad state of affairs if that's really what our 
business is like." 
</P>
<P>
 Now that Lalama may know the awful truth, will she have the heart to continue 
in the business or will she resign out of principle? Read the Tabloid Gossip 
Column to find out. 
</P>
<P>
 Body Parts!!!What sexy Hollywood Goddess of the '50s and '60s was ogled and 
graphically displayed from head to toe on TV recently? Read on. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those stunning eyes . . . that beauty mark . . . that platinum hair. . . ." 
Yes, added the pitchwoman on cable's QVC channel, "no one would dazzle quite 
like Marilyn Monroe." She added: "Whenever you see a book on Marilyn or a 
photograph, you stop and gaze. There is just something about her. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 To prove it, the QVC camera moved slowly down Marilyn's curvaceous body. 
</P>
<P>
 No, not the real Marilyn, stupid, Marilyn the 11.5-inch-tall vinyl doll, the 
one that your friends "will admire," the pitchwoman promised, "when they come 
over to your house." Yes, what an exciting prospect: Featured in your living 
room or greeting guests in your entry, your very own "fully poseable" Marilyn 
Monroe doll. 
</P>
<P>
 "She" is a limited edition with a certificate of authenticity. "This is a 
certificate you definitely want to hang on to," said the pitchwoman. Just in 
case your admiring friends doubt you. 
</P>
<P>
 And who are the buy-by-television zealots who would call QVC to order Marilyn? 
Probably the same ones who swooned over the next doll featured on QVC, Sleeping 
Beauty. "She has this incredible wig that's so long and so shiny," the 
pitchwoman said. "You could feel comfortable taking a doll brush and brushing 
it out." 
</P>
<P>
 Ooooooh. But not in front of Marilyn. She might get jealous. 
</P>
<P>
 Pretty Faces!!!Who is looking just marvelous in Tunis tonight? Deborah 
Norville, that's who -- in the debut of the CBS News magazine show "America 
Tonight," which she co-hosts with Dana King. On Tuesday, Norville showed up on 
the syndicated "Regis & Kathie Lee" series to promote her opening story about 
the adventures of a mother who recovered her kidnaped daughter in Tunisia. 
</P>
<P>
 After watching a clip of Norville doing a stand-up, Regis Philbin was mightily 
impressed. 
</P>
<P>
 Proving he's more than just a pretty face himself, Regis weighed in on the 
proliferation of newsmagazine shows, telling Norville: "That's the beauty of 
what you're doing. You can go over there and do these stories at a fraction of 
the cost and more realistic than Hollywood." 
</P>
<P>
 At last, a textbook justification for news: Not only cheaper than Hollywood, 
but also more realistic.

 Expanded 'Woodstock': Warner Bros.' 1970 Academy Award-winning documentary, 
"Woodstock," is returning to the screen this month in a new, four-hour 
director's cut featuring a completely remixed soundtrack and additional concert 
footage from Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin and Creedence Clearwater Revival. "When 
we made this film . . . there were so many performances that we loved but 
couldn't include because the length of the film was already over three hours," 
said director Michael Wadleigh, who worked on the expanded cut with his 
original sound supervisor, Larry Johnson, and original editor Jere Huggins. 
"Now we've been given the opportunity to go back and include some of this 
wonderful 'extra' material, much of it from performers who are no longer living 
but whose music continues to influence us." The new version premieres June 29 
in Los Angeles and New York and may expand to other markets at a later date.

 Weekend Anchor Named: Michael Scott, a reporter for the syndicated show 
"Entertainment Tonight," will replace Hosea Sanders as KCBS-TV's weekend anchor 
effective June 15. Scott will co-anchor the early and late evening "Action 
News" newscasts with Penny Griego and will also serve as a general assignment 
reporter for weekday "Action News" broadcasts. When Sanders, one of the few 
local black male anchors, announced he was leaving the station for a weekday 
anchor job in Chicago, community leaders said the dearth of local black anchors 
was a result of continued racism. Scott, who is also African American, has held 
previous weekday anchor jobs in Omaha.

 * Black TV Pilots: The Black Filmmaker Foundation will celebrate African 
American achievement in the television industry with its first Festival of 
Network Television Pilots, Saturday at the Creative Artists Agency in Beverly 
Hills and Sunday at the Museum of Tolerance. Saturday's program starts at 1 
p.m. and includes screenings of three drama pilots and eight sitcom pilots from 
leading black TV producers; Sunday's slate features the producers in a 3 p.m. 
panel discussion on "African Americans in Television: The State of the Art & 
the Business." "This is an exciting time for African American television 
professionals," said Karen Horne, Black Filmmaker Foundation/Los Angeles 
director. "Today, greater numbers of African American producers are not only 
creating shows, but reflecting a broader spectrum of the black experience 
through their work." Only one of the festival's featured pilots, however, an 
NBC drama called "Uptown Undercover," has been picked up for the upcoming 
season. 
</P>

 * Classical Videos: Among the myriad of new cable offerings in the works for 
next year is the Classic Music Channel, a 24-hour service offering classical 
music, ballet and opera, as well as blues, jazz, Latin music, Broadway show 
tunes and film soundtracks, all transformed into short-form music videos. Also 
planned for the channel is a home-shopping service for classical CDs and 
videos. The channel is headed by Peter J. Brightman, who has staged concerts by 
musical stars including Ella Fitzgerald, Michael Jackson, Willie Nelson, Miles 
Davis and Tony Bennett. Brightman describes the planned channel as "MTV for the 
rest of us." 
</P>
<P>
 * New Country Showcase: Country music fans get a new weekly TV showcase this 
week with the premiere of "ABC in Concert Country," a Saturday night spinoff of 
the network's Friday night pop/rock showcase "ABC in Concert." The inaugural 
1:30 a.m. broadcast features concert and interview footage from George Strait, 
Kathy Mattea, Lee Roy Parnell and Neal McCoy, plus a performance by the 
program's weekly host, Billy Dean. Trisha Yearwood will be the featured artist 
for the program's second outing June 11, which also will premiere Garth Brooks' 
new music video, "Red Strokes." QUICK TAKES

<P>
 Shock jock Howard Stern has sold the TV broadcast rights to his syndicated 
radio show to cable's E! Entertainment Television, which will begin airing the 
controversial show in a pared-down half-hour format in mid-June. The cable 
network will use six cameras to film the daily morning show at New York's 
WXRK-FM studio. . . . After previous stints hosting NBC's All-Star pregame and 
postgame programs, Bob Costas gets his first play-by-play assignment covering 
the 65th Major League Baseball All-Star Game from Three Rivers Stadium in 
Pittsburgh on July 12. . . . The Benedictine Monks of Santa Domingo De Silos, 
whose interpretations of Gregorian chants have been a surprise chart-topping 
hit, will perform June 10 on TV's "ABC in Concert." . . . As expected, the 
Universal Amphitheatre engagement for the Tony-winning Broadway musical "The 
Who's Tommy" has been extended for two weeks, through Aug. 14. Tickets for the 
added shows go on sale Sunday. SHAUNA SNOW

WORLD CUP '94: 16 DAYS AND COUNTING; ON A LARK; SOCCER SIMPLY MEANS FUN FOR 
COLOMBIA'S ASPRILLA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE CART, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Try as he might -- and the extent and sincerity of his effort must be 
seriously questioned -- Faustino Asprilla can't seem to adopt the attitude of a 
European soccer professional. 
</P>
<P>
 The 24-year-old Colombian lives his life with a wink and a shrug. His success 
as a forward on Parma's first division team has the citizens of this tidy town 
in Italy's breadbasket chanting "Tino, Tino" at games with every feint and 
daring dribble.  
</P>
<P>
 Asprilla's two years here have bonded him to a culture and people utterly 
different than his own -- a relationship that has enriched both parties. Fans 
appreciate that Asprilla, unlike some non-Italian stars, bothered to learn the 
language, to which he adds a decidedly Spanish flavor. The fans have learned a 
little of Asprilla's infectious South American love of life, with all its 
complexities. "As a person, I am happy, very happy," Asprilla said, laughing. 
"I am always in good humor. I like to sing." 
</P>
<P>
 Residents of Parma love Asprilla as they would a wayward but good-hearted 
neighborhood kid -- the boy who habitually breaks windows with a baseball. 
Their tolerance was stretched when, after months of deluging his neighbors with 
high-decibel blasts of his beloved salsa music, Asprilla and his wife moved out 
of their in-town apartment to a house where, reports say, Asprilla still plays 
his music at levels that shake the olives out of the trees. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Parma's adoring fans happily indulge his eccentricities, usually 
involving automobiles. Asprilla is aware that there are rules governing the 
road, he simply doesn't believe they apply to him. Asprilla was involved in six 
car accidents in his first two weeks in Italy. He once thought nothing of 
parking his sports car in a busy intersection for two days, reasoning that the 
light had been red when he left it. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "The players know how he is," a journalist who covers the team says. "They 
know it is impossible to ask him to be a European player. For him, football is 
a game, not work. That's the difference. It is not right to say he's not 
professional. He's professional. But he's a South American player, and that 
means football is a game and not a business." 
</P>
<P>
 But to Parma club officials, Asprilla is big business. His modest transfer fee 
of $4.5 million two years ago would likely be doubled should Parma wish to sell 
him, which it doesn't. His salary is reported to be about $700,000. "Asprilla 
is our Diego Maradona," said Parma's president, Giorgio Pedraneschi. "He is the 
player who can turn a match around at a moment." 
</P>
<P>
 In last season's Cup Winners' Cup competition, between the postseason 
tournament winners of Europe's pro leagues, Parma rallied to beat Dergefors of 
Sweden, 2-1, when Asprilla scored two spectacular goals in eight minutes. That 
night, the president of Colombia called Asprilla and let him know that when he 
played so well he was an "ambassador" of Colombia. 
</P>
<P>
 Asprilla took diplomatic license the next week against Turin in an Italian 
league match, scoring three goals, each showing his versatility: The first came 
on a header, the second using his left foot, the third using his right foot. 
</P>
<P>
 In the midst of his scoring run, Asprilla reverted to his old antics. The day 
of the game in Sweden, teammate Luigi Apolloni took Asprilla fishing at a 
nearby lake, although the Colombian had never fished. Asprilla saw it as an 
adventure, which it very nearly was. As he was rowing a small wooden boat to 
shore, Apolloni suddenly stood up, causing the boat to tip. Asprilla fell in. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately, he could swim better than he could fish. When Asprilla returned 
to the team hotel less than an hour before the match, he offered no 
explanation. His philosophy was that his two goals in the game spoke for him. 
</P>
<P>
 Asprilla said he doesn't see the need to explain his sometimes erratic 
behavior. "How I play, this is important," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But his biggest stunt didn't allow him to play in Parma's most important game 
of last season, the Cup Winners' Cup final against Antwerp of Belgium. Ten days 
before the game, Asprilla had returned to Colombia because of the death of his 
mother. When he returned to Italy, Asprilla limped in with a deep gash on his 
right calf, a cut that required 27 stitches and a month of recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 His coach, understandably, demanded an explanation. Asprilla initially offered 
none, but eventually said he had stepped on a bottle at his home's pool. No one 
believed the story, but Asprilla stuck with it. The injury was seen as 
Asprilla's letting down his teammates and even Parma's victory against Antwerp 
did little to soften public opinion against him.  
</P>
<P>
 Neither did the real story of his injury. Typically, it involved an 
automobile. Asprilla was driving in Medellin and a city bus cut him off. He 
sped and cut off the bus, jumped out of his car and attempted to treat the bus 
to several of his free kicks. 
</P>
<P>
 Asprilla was already in trouble in Colombia for an incident during World Cup 
qualifying. He missed a penalty kick against Paraguay and was benched. Angry 
and embarrassed, Asprilla sneaked out of the team hotel and drove 150 miles in 
the middle of the night to see his wife, Catalina. 
</P>
<P>
 The Colombian Football Federation wanted to ban Asprilla for life, but World 
Cup Coach Jose Maturana argued that the team would not qualify if Asprilla did 
not play. Again, Asprilla let his actions on the field speak for him -- he 
scored two goals in Colombia's 5-0 upset of Argentina last September in World 
Cup qualifying. 
</P>
<P>
 While journalists frequently bring up these incidents, Asprilla doesn't care 
to dwell on them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have forgotten completely what happened last year," Asprilla said in his 
soft, husky voice on the eve of Parma's return to the Cup Winners' Cup final, 
which it lost to Arsenal of England. "The life in Colombia is very different 
than the life in Europe. Not so fast. (My adjustment) has been difficult, 
because in Italy football is very different. The mind is different here. Here, 
they are all more involved in the game. All they think is football." 
</P>
<P>
 Asprilla began to play soccer at 8 in his hometown, a small farming village 
near Cali. His professional career began at 15 with Cucuta Deportivo. He also 
spent three seasons with one of Colombia's most powerful teams, Atletico 
Nacional in Medellin, the team owned by the late drug lord, Pablo Escobar. 
</P>
<P>
 Italian scouts saw Asprilla play in a youth tournament and were dazzled by his 
combination of explosive strength and grace. The frequent comparisons to 
Maradona are a reference to Asprilla's exceptional ball control and his elusive 
running. 
</P>
<P>
 The elusive nature of Asprilla as a personality has perplexed his 
long-suffering coach, Nevio Scala. Parma and Scala were taking a chance on 
Asprilla even with his obvious talent because no Colombian player had lasted 
more than a year with an Italian club. "My coach gave me the opportunity to 
play here," Asprilla said, smiling. "When I had bad things, he was very patient 
with me. He always gives me a chance to play." 
</P>
<P>
 Asprilla is not specific about what bad things have happened. "Everybody has 
problems. Whatever problems I have are solved and I can solve them alone," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Asprilla remains unfazed, as ever. His ample enthusiasm is now turned to the 
World Cup and Colombia's status as sleeping tiger, waiting to pounce on Group 
A, which includes the United States, Romania and Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the best Colombian team ever," he said. "We hope to play good 
football. I know we will." World Cup Player Profile

MIKE DOWNEY: UNAFRAID TO BAUBLE THE BAWL

<TEXT>
<P>
 O n a day in May, they came to play  
</P>
<P>
 Some baseball in Cincinnati,  
</P>
<P>
 When a trade was made that the boss OK'd  
</P>
<P>
 Thus proving her slightly batty.  
</P>
<P>
 While the other Reds lay heads to beds  
</P>
<P>
 Their GM acquired a player  
</P>
<P>
 Wearing earrings where he is hearing  
</P>
<P>
 And more diamonds than Liz Taylor.  
</P>
<P>
 Name was Deion, oft called "Neon,"  
</P>
<P>
 Quite a quirky center fielder.  
</P>
<P>
 As fleet of feet as one might meet;  
</P>
<P>
 A hard-to-apprehend base stealer.  
</P>
<P>
 Yes, a jewel -- with every tool --  
</P>
<P>
 Was dazzling Sanders, was he not? 
</P>
<P>
 Yet this youthful Red had cause to dread  
</P>
<P>
 For he now worked for Marge Schott.  
</P>
<P>
 A mouth, well, large had made old Marge  
</P>
<P>
 The talk, talk, talk of the town.  
</P>
<P>
 As a woman, although human,  
</P>
<P>
 She seemed fonder of her hound.  
</P>
<P>
 Baseball banned her, couldn't stand her 
</P>
<P>
 Had her exiled for a season.  
</P>
<P>
 But she surfaced with a purpose:  
</P>
<P>
 A proposal to be decent.  
</P>
<P>
 I will never, vowed Marge, ever  
</P>
<P>
 Use the language I once spoke.  
</P>
<P>
 I'll view my field with my lips sealed  
</P>
<P>
 And I'm not just blowing smoke.  
</P>
<P>
 Well, such whimsy tickled Cincy  
</P>
<P>
 But it must be duly noted.  
</P>
<P>
 Tongue betrayed her, two months later.  
</P>
<P>
 ('Round the next time she was quoted.)  
</P>
<P>
 There are some men, Marge Schott said then,  
</P>
<P>
 While I love the little dears,  
</P>
<P>
 I am paying for their playing  
</P>
<P>
 Not to have their damn ears pierced.  
</P>
<P>
 Would Yogi Berra wear mascara?  
</P>
<P>
 Would you see rouge on Pete Rose?  
</P>
<P>
 Would you see the Mick wear lipstick?  
</P>
<P>
 Or Clemente panty hose? 
</P>
<P>
 Would Mays have played in bracelets?  
</P>
<P>
 No, and neither would Babe Ruth.  
</P>
<P>
 Picture Aaron wearin' pearls!  
</P>
<P>
 Sandy Koufax a gold tooth!  
</P>
<P>
 My point, said Schott, is that I'm not  
</P>
<P>
 Afraid to speak the truth.  
</P>
<P>
 Namely being, I've been seeing 
</P>
<P>
 Men in earrings -- bunch of fruits!  
</P>
<P>
 The brouhaha from this new faux pas  
</P>
<P>
 Caused another big league groan.  
</P>
<P>
 When it came to names to shame the game  
</P>
<P>
 Hers remained in a league of her own.  
</P>
<P>
 Schott apologized, then theorized  
</P>
<P>
 That "fruit" had plural meanings. 
</P>
<P>
 Marge's true intent, what she really meant,  
</P>
<P>
 Uh, transcended sexual leanings?  
</P>
<P>
 As protests thundered, many wondered  
</P>
<P>
 How Marge would react once she's  
</P>
<P>
 Been introduced to an athlete who's  
</P>
<P>
 Having breakfast at Tiffany's.  
</P>
<P>
 Did Deion Sanders misunderstand  
</P>
<P>
 Her remark about guys being fruits?  
</P>
<P>
 Would it be feckless to wear his necklace,  
</P>
<P>
 The one with the 24-karat loops?  
</P>
<P>
 Well, Deion appeared, and people cheered  
</P>
<P>
 While Marge remained rather docile.  
</P>
<P>
 He wore golden globes in both his lobes  
</P>
<P>
 But nothing -- whew! -- in his nostrils.  
</P>
<P>
 Welcome to my town, and stick around!  
</P>
<P>
 Heard the player from his employer.  
</P>
<P>
 If you need a friend I can recommend  
</P>
<P>
 My own civil-rights case lawyer.  
</P>
<P>
 A conservative city, but Deion, pretty,  
</P>
<P>
 Decided 'twas best to be bold. 
</P>
<P>
 As onlookers passed, to each he asked:  
</P>
<P>
 Do the Reds clash with my gold?  
</P>
<P>
 It remains to be seen if Cincy's team  
</P>
<P>
 Wins the pennant at season's end.  
</P>
<P>
 If Deion gets dirty and hits .330  
</P>
<P>
 Diamonds will be Marge's best friend.  
</P>
<P>
 See, it doesn't matter to every batter 
</P>
<P>
 Why the hometown crowd keeps cheering.  
</P>
<P>
 Yet there's still one hitter we cannot picture.  
</P>
<P>

TITANS TAKING TIME TO REVIEW THE SEASON; BASEBALL: CAL STATE FULLERTON IS 
EMOTIONALLY DRAINED AFTER ITS VICTORY IN THE REGIONALS. NEXT STOP IS THE 
COLLEGE WORLD SERIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Cal State Fullerton was seeded seventh and will face second-seeded Georgia 
Tech in the first round of the College World Series on Friday, but the Titans 
were thinking more about regrouping mentally and physically Tuesday than about 
the team they will face first in Omaha. 
</P>
<P>
 Players and coaches were still feeling drained following an emotion-charged 
regional championship surge Monday that demanded victories over Memphis State 
and top-seeded Oklahoma State. Oklahoma State began the tournament ranked third 
in the nation and constantly was boosted by a vocal home crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone's real tired right now," said George Horton, Titan associate head 
coach. "That was a lot of tough competition in a span of 12 hours." 
</P>
<P>
 The Titans, however, will have to quickly turn their attention to the first 
game of what Coach Augie Garrido is calling "Chapter Three" of another highly 
successful season. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton will be in a bracket with third-seeded LSU and sixth-seeded Florida 
State. Top-seeded Miami and eighth-seeded Arizona State will be first-round 
opponents in the other bracket, as will fourth-seeded Oklahoma and fifth-seeded 
Auburn. 
</P>
<P>
 The winners in the two double-elimination brackets meet in a winner-take-all 
game for the national championship June 11. CBS will televise the game. Many of 
the other games will be televised live by ESPN, including the Fullerton-Georgia 
Tech game at 12:30 p.m. (PDT) on Friday. Four games will be carried live on 
ESPN2. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, unlike in the regional where all the opponents were new faces, the 
Titans will face a team they defeated earlier in the season. Fullerton beat 
Georgia Tech, 2-0, in February in Fullerton. Mike Parisi gave up four hits 
through seven innings, and reliever Ted Silva pitched the last two innings, 
allowing two hits. 
</P>
<P>
 It turned out to be the only time Georgia Tech, now 47-16, was held scoreless 
all season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really don't see any advantage for either team in the fact that we played 
one another earlier in the season," Garrido said. "George and Rick (Vanderhook) 
do a real good job in gathering information on all the teams we play. So we'll 
know just as much about any of the other teams we play." 
</P>
<P>
 Georgia Tech has three players who are potential first-round selections in 
Thursday's major league baseball draft. That group includes catcher Jason 
Varitek, shortstop Normar Garciaparra and center fielder Jay Payton. 
</P>
<P>
 All were first-team All-American selections by Baseball America. Both Varitek 
and Garciaparra were members of the 1992 U.S. Olympic team. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're an impressive baseball team right now," Horton said. "It would be a 
mistake for us to think we're a better team because of one game played in 
February." 
</P>
<P>
 Garrido agrees and points out that the important thing for his team is to 
regroup and be ready to play its best baseball, regardless of the opponent. 
"What we've got to do now is get some rest and get refocused. We'll need to be 
at the top of our game on Friday," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Center fielder Dante Powell, who pulled a hamstring muscle running to first 
base late in the regional championship game Monday night, was sore Tuesday, but 
Garrido is hopeful he will be ready by Friday. "Our trainer told me he thought 
it was more on the minor side of things, that it doesn't appear to be major," 
Garrido said. 
</P>
<P>
 The team will be back on the road today, leaving for Omaha in the early 
afternoon. The Titans will work out there Thursday.

RAMS EXPECTED TO RELEASE JONES, FOUR OTHERS TODAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T.J. SIMERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Rams, who are negotiating to add wide receiver Jessie Hester and 
cornerback Terry Taylor to their roster, will release five players today and 
inform another five that they have no interest in maintaining exclusive 
contract rights in exchange for a 10% pay increase. 
</P>
<P>
 The planned personnel moves, expected to include wide receiver Ernie Jones' 
release, will be made in response to today's NFL deadline requiring teams to 
offer unrestricted and restricted free agents minimum contract offers or give 
up long-range negotiating rights. 
</P>
<P>
 The team will relinquish such rights to linebacker Chris Martin, tight end 
Travis McNeal, center Blair Bush and cornerbacks Darryl Henley and Wymon 
Henderson. The Rams still will be allowed to negotiate with these players, and 
is presently doing so with Martin, but instead of belonging exclusively to the 
Rams if still unsigned as of July 15, they will be free to sign elsewhere at 
any time. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams have offered linebacker Roman Phifer and cornerbacks Dexter Davis and 
Robert Bailey 10% pay increases, thereby maintaining their exclusive rights. 
</P>
<P>
 Today's moves, which also are being made to help stay under the salary cap, 
will include the announcement that defensive end Gerald Robinson has agreed to 
take a pay cut. Robinson, who earned $1 million a year ago, will earn a base 
salary of $560,000 this season. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams will announce the players to be cut later today, and though club 
officials indicated the list will not include any "big name" players, Jones is 
expected to be released. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones was acquired from the Cardinals last season for a fifth-round pick and 
caught five passes for 56 yards, including two for touchdowns. He is due to 
earn $500,000 this season, but becomes expendable because of his large salary, 
the acquisition of New England wide receiver Greg McMurtry and the anticipated 
signing of Hester, who caught 64 passes for 835 yards for Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams also have extended a contract offer to Taylor, a former Seahawk who 
played previously for Coach Chuck Knox. Taylor played for Cleveland last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams have 71 players under contract, and a total of 86, including unsigned 
players, who will count against the salary cap. The team must still come to 
terms with eight drafted players, Phifer, Bailey, Davis and four veterans 
(tackle Darryl Ashmore, quarterback T.J. Rubley, and running backs Tim Lester 
and Howard Griffith), who failed to have the time in service to qualify as 
restricted or unrestricted free agents. 
</P>
<P>
 The team must report to training camp July 22 at UC Irvine with no more than 
80 players under contract.

NCAA TRACK AND FIELD; KISS SETS SIGHTS ON HAMMER MARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATT WHITE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was the new kid on the block arriving at the sandlot with a bat, asking, 
"Can I play?" and promptly breaking every window in the house across the 
street. 
</P>
<P>
 On the day before the 1993 NCAA hammer throw in New Orleans, Texas El Paso's 
throwers agreed to work out with a much talked about but little seen freshman 
from USC, Balazs Kiss. "There were three of them throwing over 230 and all 
three had started the year with better marks than Balazs," USC throw coach Dan 
Lange recalled. "We heard at the beginning of the year, 'They're going to go 
1-2-3.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The Miners' throwers watched Kiss start at 220 feet, then throw 228, then 232, 
then 236. 
</P>
<P>
 UTEP's Mike Laaksonen had won the 1992 title at 233-11. 
</P>
<P>
 Warming to his task, Kiss went 239, 245, 252. End of practice session. 
</P>
<P>
 "They went from throwing 230 to hitting the cage and flying around," Lange 
said. "After that, the meet was for second." 
</P>
<P>
 Letting Kiss rattle the competition was easy and, well, kind of fun. Keeping 
Kiss from rattling himself was a different matter. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Pacific 10 meet a week before, the pressure of his first big 
competition had gotten to Kiss and he had not slept the night before the final. 
For all his physical gifts, he had arrived at USC short on high-pressure 
experience and shorter on temper. 
</P>
<P>
 In New Orleans, when Lange went to awaken Kiss the next morning, the door took 
all of two seconds to open. 
</P>
<P>
 Standing in his uniform, Kiss said: "I slept eight hours. The meet's over." 
</P>
<P>
 And it was. Kiss threw 246-10 to Laaksonen's 233-7. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bo" to his teammates, the Balazs Kiss that dominated the 1993 NCAA meet was 
the world-class physical Kiss. The ersion that Lange and Kiss hope to unveil 
today in the NCAA hammer throw finals at Boise, Ida., will be one with a 
reworked psychological game. 
</P>
<P>
 "Balazs came in with a goal he thought was high, 75 meters (246 feet)," Lange 
said. "He surpassed that in the third meet. When you surpass your goal, it 
takes an adjustment period." Said Kiss: "Its kind of like a barrier between a 
low 70-meter thrower and a high 70-meter thrower. It's a big deal. If you're a 
low 70-meter thrower, you're just a prospect, just a promise. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you throw a 75, you can go to the Olympics and World Championships." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Lange: "He should be thinking 80." So, Lange introduced Kiss to a new set 
of training principles. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a Southern Californian, he's from Hungary. We're from a world apart," 
Lange said. "The hammer is a rhythmic sport. You have to feel the weight and 
actually ride it, letting it do the work, rather than try and fight it out with 
your strength. You have to be strong and not use your strength." 
</P>
<P>
 Lange's approach didn't appeal to Kiss. It was like telling Babe Ruth to bunt. 
</P>
<P>
 In April's Mt. San Antonio College Invitational, Kiss bucked back. Frustrated 
at a lack of progress toward the NCAA record of 257 feet, he took the 
matter-over-mind approach and threw 248 feet, a crushing disappointment. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, Kiss started listening. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a totally different thrower now because he's a totally different 
athlete," Lange said. "He's much more confident."

SOUTHERN SECTION DIVISION II TENNIS CHAMPIONSHIPS; SUNNY HILLS TOPS PALM DESERT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE McKIBBEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Palm Desert boys' tennis team accomplished more against Sunny Hills than 
most teams have. They scored seven points and they rattled the nerves of a 
normally stoic Kevin Kim. 
</P>
<P>
 But Palm Desert didn't stop Sunny Hills from repeating as Southern Section 
Division II champions as it lost to the top-seeded Lancers, 14-7, Tuesday at 
Shadow Mountain Resort & Racquet Club. 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, Sunny Hills Coach Steve White thanked Palm Desert for finally 
giving his team some competition. The Lancers' only loss in 23 matches came to 
Division I semifinalist Palos Verdes Peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
 "Palm Desert was really fun to play," White said just before being doused with 
a full cooler. "They don't give up. They're bulldogs." 
</P>
<P>
 Kim, the nation's No. 1-ranked player in the boys' 16 division, might not 
agree with White's characterization of third-seeded Palm Desert, which finished 
20-5-1. Starting in the first set, Kim became involved in a trash-talking duel 
with several Palm Desert players. 
</P>
<P>
 Kim, who was playing No. 3 doubles with Hiren Bhavsar, fired the first shot by 
nailing Palm Desert's Butch Price in the head on a wicked return shot. Kim's 
aggressive play continued in the second set against Palm Desert's Brian 
Battistone and Tyler Zundel. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, Zundel and Battistone took offense to Kim's target practice and 
began talking and hitting back. Kim's head was the recipient of a rocket return 
from Battistone. The well-placed volley seemed to inspire Zundel and Battistone 
and unnerve Kim, who had his serve and his concentration broken. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's the No. 1 player in the nation and we got under his skin," Zundel said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kim, who won his three sets, 6-4, 6-3, 6-1, didn't agree. 
</P>
<P>
 "The second match was real fun," Kim said with a big grin. "They weren't 
getting to me. I didn't try to hit him. I said, 'I'm sorry.' But they started 
the trash and I can trash talk, too." 
</P>
<P>
 But Joseph Gilbert, Kim's close friend who was playing doubles on the adjacent 
court, acknowledged that Zundel and Battistone might have won the war of words 
even if they did lose the set, 6-4. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's how they got 6-4 off of Kevin, trash talking to him," Gilbert said. 
"Instead of trying to win, he was just trying to get back at them. But Coach 
White told us to get back at them with tennis." 
</P>
<P>
 The Lancers did just that as they took a 9 1/3-4 2/3 lead into the third round 
before Gilbert and his partner, Joey Springer, clinched it with a 6-0 victory 
over Battistone and Zundel. Gilbert and Springer won their other two sets, 6-1, 
6-4, and finished five rounds of the playoffs undefeated in 15 sets. 
</P>
<P>
 "I forgot about everything else, but 10 2/3 (the amount of points needed to 
win)," Springer said. "That's all that really matters." 
</P>
<P>
 It also mattered that John Han, Juno Kuan and Shaun Harris gave Sunny Hills 
six points by each winning two of their three singles sets. 
</P>
<P>
 What mattered most to White was that his team has won consecutive section 
titles, even if those titles haven't come against the likes of Santa Barbara 
and Dana Hills at the Division I level. 
</P>
<P>
 "Being a coach in two sports (basketball and tennis), I really appreciate 
this," said White, whose school will jump to Division I next year. "It's not 
easy to win a section title. I'm not ready to move up. For me to say I want the 
Division I schools doesn't make sense. I'm no fool, I'll take a section title 
no matter what level."

CALABASAS HOPES 3RD COACH IS THE CHARM; SOUTHERN SECTION TENNIS: FRONTIER 
LEAGUE CHAMPION COYOTES ARE BAD BOYS OF DIVISION IV. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANA HADDAD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Imagine the nightmare of coaching a team with seven John McEnroes. That might 
explain why the Calabasas High boys' tennis team has had three head coaches 
this spring. 
</P>
<P>
 Ed Charles will lead the Coyotes into the Southern Section Division IV team 
final against Los Padres League champion Santa Ynez at Agoura High today at 
3:15 p.m. But win or lose, he's leaving the Coyotes, whom he describes as 
headstrong, difficult to manage and lacking commitment. 
</P>
<P>
 They also are talented. Despite losing their top two players, Calabasas won 
the Frontier League title and has a 16-4 record. Santa Ynez is 19-3. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're good players," said Charles, who took over the team with three weeks 
left in the regular season. "There are going to be college kids coming out of 
that school." 
</P>
<P>
 But Charles, a former coach at Cal State Los Angeles, hasn't enjoyed his brief 
stint with the Coyotes. He is quitting, in part, because he has seen too many 
ego clashes on the Calabasas courts. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are kids that challenge each other a lot and they keep each other on 
edge all the time," Charles said. "And I don't want to say anything about 
winning (today), because they'll get cocky and go off on it." 
</P>
<P>
 The turmoil at Calabasas started March 29, when fourth-year Coach Casey Allen, 
without warning, handed his resignation to Athletic Director Cindy Jones on the 
day of a key match against Burbank. The match was postponed and Jones took over 
the team until she could find a replacement. 
</P>
<P>
 Enter Charles. He said he inherited players who often ditched practices as 
well as matches, which sometimes forced junior-varsity players into varsity 
action. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only thing that I've done is have them show up," Charles said. "They're 
teen-agers. It's hard to have any kind of discipline -- especially coming in 
with three weeks left. There's enough talent to (beat Santa Ynez). But it could 
go the other way, because sometimes they don't feel like trying." 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, the Coyotes have reached the section final without top players 
Jason Weiss and Jason Cook. Weiss has missed the entire season because of an 
injured back, and Cook withdrew from school at midseason to start a home-study 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Herz, the No. 3 singles player, was moved to No. 1. Assi Cohen, a senior 
who was academically ineligible until late in the season, and one-time reserve 
Alex Wan have filled in at Nos. 2 and 3. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been pretty difficult -- we didn't know what was going on sometimes," 
said Wan, who transferred to Calabasas from Kansas. "We never had that much 
team spirit, not like my other teams. There's been a lot of trash talk in 
practice." 
</P>
<P>
 The Coyotes have at least one admirer. Jones, the athletic director is 
impressed with their resilience. 
</P>
<P>
 "I admire them so much for going through this season and still coming out on 
top," Jones said. "I was almost not wanting to get another coach, even though I 
knew there would be someone more knowledgeable than me. I was afraid of putting 
them through another transition." 
</P>
<P>
 A victory today could provide a smooth ending to the rough ride.

O.C. POP BEAT / MIKE BOEHM: THE PALADINS HOME-IN ON A NEW COURSE; ROOTS ROCK: 
ON THE HEELS OF RELEASING ITS FOURTH ALBUM, THE BAND, AT THE COACH HOUSE 
FRIDAY, WANTS A FRESH START. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE BOEHM 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Paladins had a hard time deciding what to call their first new album in 
four years. 
</P>
<P>
 It always helps to have a name that is pithy and descriptive and easily under 
stood. But the Paladins' career and music has defied shorthand description. 
</P>
<P>
 High school buddies Dave Gonzalez and Tom Yearsley founded the band 14 years 
ago in the San Diego County town of Encinitas. When their debut album came out 
in 1987, they were tagged as a rockabilly band, but that wasn't entirely 
accurate. If you asked Gonzalez and Yearsley, they were playing all-purpose, 
rootsy rock 'n' roll. 
</P>
<P>
 Their next step was to sign with the respected Chicago-based blues label 
Alligator. The Paladins knew the Alligator association would help them get 
publicity, good bookings and reliable distribution for their records. They 
thought they could be on Alligator, which released their albums "Years Since 
Yesterday" and "Let's Buzz," and not get pegged as a blues act. In hindsight, 
they now agree, they were wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 Now on a new label, the Paladins, who play the Coach House on Friday, regarded 
their fourth album as an opportunity to start fresh, emphasize the new, and 
clarify what they were about. 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzalez, the Paladins' guitarist and primary lead singer, and bassist 
Yearsley had recruited a new drummer with impressive credentials -- Jeff 
Donavan, a longtime sideman to country star Dwight Yoakam. Songwriting was to 
be a big focus of the new album. The Paladins wanted to prove themselves as 
writers worthy of a general, broad rock audience, rather than only a 
specialized following of blues-guitar or '50s-rock lovers. Gonzalez, Yearsley 
and Donavan wrote songs as a unit and supplemented their output with 
contributions from two accomplished friends, Dave Alvin and Jack Tempchin. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 They signed with a Houston-based label, Sector 2, and decided to call the 
album "Re'Jive'Inated," in honor of the fresh outlook. 
</P>
<P>
 That's when things got complicated again. 
</P>
<P>
 The record company thought a punning title would be confusing, Gonzalez 
recalled as the trio gathered for a recent interview. What's more, the title 
tune "Re'Jive'Inated" was an instrumental, and a jazz-leaning one at that; its 
tempered, Wes Montgomery-influenced sound is not exactly the first thing you'd 
want easily confused rock radio program directors to cue up when it came time 
to decide whether the Paladins should get a spin. 
</P>
<P>
 The band's next title idea was "One Step Closer to the Blues," the refrain of 
a heavy, catchy, tough-sounding album track that alternately calls to mind 
Stevie Ray Vaughan and ZZ Top. Then they thought better of it, because they 
wanted to downplay the idea that they were just a blues band, which is exactly 
what people would assume if they judged an album called "One Step Closer to the 
Blues" by its cover. 
</P>
<P>
 So the Paladins decided to go with "Ticket Home," the title of the song that 
best represents their new approach. Its strong, melodic refrain and layered, 
atmospheric production would seem to make the song a contender for album-rock 
playlists. While the album includes a couple of stripped-down, hot-rocking 
workouts, such tracks as the title song, "Every Time I See Her," "One Step," 
"One Love," "Comfort You" and "Brand New Heart" would seem to position the 
Paladins for a possible breakthrough to the mainstream that such roots-music 
brethren as Los Lobos, Jeff Healey and Robert Cray have enjoyed at least 
intermittently during their careers. 
</P>
<P>
 The Paladins give some of the credit for the more complex recording approach 
to Cesar Rosas, the Los Lobos guitarist who co-produced the album with the 
three band members. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cesar would say, 'You really need to put an acoustic guitar here,' or, 'Man, 
I hear an organ sound here,' " Gonzalez said. "In our early days, we were 
insistent: no overdubs."  
</P>
<P>
 That, noted Yearsley, was because the Paladins felt during the 1980s that they 
were carrying the roots-music torch against the "homogenized studio sounds" of 
synth-based, slickly rendered music. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were rebellious against that. We recorded nothing we couldn't (reproduce) 
on stage." With "Ticket Home," he said, the aim was to preserve spontaneous 
energy in the performances, even as the arrangements and recording methods 
became more detailed. 
</P>
<P>
 The Paladins had come to Costa Mesa for the interview. Gonzalez and Yearsley, 
both 33, drove from Encinitas in the gray Dodge van on which they have logged 
some 270,000 touring miles since the mid-'80s. Tagging along was Yearsley's 
sweet-natured 5-year-old, Tommy Jr. Donavan, 40, came from Pasadena, his base 
for a side career as a studio musician and teacher of drumming whose recent 
credits include sessions for John Fogerty's next album. 
</P>
<P>
 Seated around a lunch table, Gonzalez wore the jeans, boots, slicked-back 
pompadour and long sideburns of a '50s rocker. But there was none of the 
hipster's jauntiness or stereotypical "rebel without a cause" attitude that one 
might expect, given the pop-cultural history behind that look. Instead, 
Gonzalez comes off as a thoroughly earnest man with a clear sense of conviction 
about the band. 
</P>
<P>
 Yearsley, dapperly attired in a sporty jacket and a fedora that harked back 
more toward the '40s (during the interview he swapped the fedora for the straw 
boater worn by the equally natty Tommy Jr.), was more laid back, but also 
earnest about the Paladins. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Donavan, who has a quietly confident air, joined the Paladins 2 1/2 years ago 
when Yearsley called him to see whether he could recommend any of his students 
for an audition with the band. Donavan, who was still playing with Yoakam at 
the time, recommended himself. He played in both bands for more than a year, 
before parting with Yoakam last spring in what he says was a joint decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd been doing a lot of work for major-album artists, and it was kind of a 
stifling world," Donavan said. "The way records are made -- the sterile, 
clinical production values -- doesn't jive with how I like to play. Instead of 
touring and having to play the exact record parts, there's really no limit to 
what the drum part can do in this trio. You can go wild and crazy or play it 
real simple." 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzalez says he badly wanted "Ticket Home" to be the Paladins' ticket to 
major-label status. But none of the large companies that expressed interests 
offered a deal, and the band wound up with the fledgling Sector 2. 
</P>
<P>
 "For some reason (the big labels) would always pass. We've come to know that," 
Gonzalez said in a stoical tone of voice. "It was very disappointing." With 
Sector 2, he said, "we know they believe in us, so we have to believe in them." 
</P>
<P>
 Yearsley and Donavan see advantages to the big-fish-in-a-small-pond approach. 
The band's strategy now is to return to the hard-touring regimen that saw it 
average 250 dates a year before tapering off to 100 last year so it could 
devote time to writing and recording. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a regimen that puts a strain on family life, as borne out in songs like 
the yearning "Ticket Home." In fact, Yearsley and Gonzalez said, two previous 
Paladins drummers left the band because of the strain that the band's frequent 
travels placed on their families. Yearsley is married to country singer Candye 
Kane (besides Tommy Jr., he has a 14-year-old son). Donavan is married and the 
father of a 13-year-old son, and Gonzalez is planning to get married in August. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 With those attachments, Gonzalez said, a hard-touring regimen becomes that 
much harder. None of the band was married when the Paladins first started 
traveling. 
</P>
<P>
 "We knew if we stayed on the road and persisted enough, we'd sell records. 
Now, it's harder. We were known as the king of the club acts for so long, and 
we always wanted to bust out of it. We felt frustrated because we felt the 
songs could be on the radio or MTV and reach a lot of people. We're hoping this 
album is the start of getting our name back out there." 
</P>
<P>
 Have band, must travel. Maybe Gonzalez and Yearsley sealed that fate for 
themselves when they decided on a name for themselves. Gonzalez said it 
involves more than a connection with a gunslinging character from '50s TV. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we looked up the word, 'paladin,' we saw that it means 'protagonist of a 
cause," he recalled. "That was it. I always wanted to have an original-sounding 
rock 'n' roll band." 
</P>
<P>
 * The Paladins, the Jive Kings and the Offenders play Friday at 8 p.m. at the 
Coach House, 33157 Camino Capistrano, San Juan Capistrano. $10. (714) 496-8930.

Q&A; 'SOMETHING FROM THE HEART' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT HILBURN, TIMES POP MUSIC CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's no accident that David Byrne's new solo album is titled simply "David 
Byrne."  
</P>
<P>
 After more than a dozen albums with Talking Heads and on his own, the 
singer-songwriter, called "Rock's Renaissance Man" in an '80s Time magazine 
cover story, has made his most personal work.  
</P>
<P>
 Gone is much of the emotional shield Byrne held up during the Heads days, when 
he was the wry, detached observer of human foibles and fads. Gone, too, are 
most of the elements of world music that characterized his two earlier solo 
collections -- 1989's "Rei Momo" and 1992's "Uh-Oh."  
</P>
<P>
 In the new album, Byrne, 42, speaks with a new directness on topics ranging 
from innocence and love to morality and death in ways that are frequently both 
disarming and endearing.  
</P>
<P>
 Before leaving New York on a European tour with his new band, Byrne spoke 
about the album and how the AIDS-related death two years ago of his 
sister-in-law, designer Tina Chow, helped push him toward a more personal tone 
in his music.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Question: What about the expectations surrounding someone whose work has been 
as heralded as yours? Is it something that inspires you to do better, or does 
it burden you? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: It is a little bit of both. The burden part goes along with the whole 
Western myth of progress. . . . That every year we have got to come up with 
something new . . . something that has to be exciting. That is what causes you 
to end up with all these disposable trends . . . these styles and stuff that 
one just replaces the other. You end up pushing artists just to innovate for 
the sake of innovation, which is kind of futile in the end. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, the (expectation) is good because it gives people a kick in 
the ass . . . and makes them try to set a standard for themselves because they 
know people are watching. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What was the starting point in the new album? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Probably the song "Buck Naked." I wrote it when my wife's sister was dying 
of AIDS and so was kind of born out of that grief and confusion. . . . Trying 
to explain what was happening to our little daughter. I think that kind of 
acted as a catalyst. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: The interesting thing is that it's not just the lyrics that are more 
intimate or personal, but the whole feel of the record -- the bareness of the 
arrangements. How did that come about? 
</P>
<P>
 A: During the tour, I would often just play the new material with an acoustic 
guitar in front of an audience. I would introduce the material that way and 
kind of work it out for myself. . . . How to sing it . . . what attitude to 
take, all that kind of stuff. Afterward, people often said the strength of the 
writing came across a lot more that way . . . the meaning of the song. So, I 
decided to strip the band down to sort of the essentials . . . leaving in only 
what was needed to just embellish the song a little bit. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Did part of you resist being so personal in the music? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Oh, that's a constant thing I think. Plus as a writer, it is easy to fall 
into traps of writing what you know how to do . . . what you can do kind of 
easily. And, with me, it wasn't the personal kinds of songs. It was more those 
funny, quirky little songs. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: It's also safer to write as the observer, isn't it? It's not like you're 
revealing yourself. 
</P>
<P>
 A: Yes. If the song is real personal, it's not just that they don't like the 
songs, which you can easily accept, but that they don't like you. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What about during the Heads days? . . . Were there some songs that were 
very personal? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Oh, there were plenty. Songs like "Cool Water" and "Naive Melody" come to 
mind first. In those days, however, they were mixed in with others so they 
didn't stand out. They didn't kind of announce themselves as being completely 
different from the rest of the stuff. 
</P>
<P>
 In my case, I think I have gotten far enough away from (the Heads days) that I 
don't care what people say so much, which gives you this incredible freedom to 
lay it on the line and say what you think. . . . I just wanted to write 
something from the heart . . . something about my own experiences and feelings 
. . . the kind of music that I look for when I listen to other artists and am 
moved by their work. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: In the new "Sad Song," you say, "But it's the truly sad people who get the 
most out of life." What do you mean by that? 
</P>
<P>
 A: People want the world to be a Hallmark card place, but that's really 
disgusting. There is no richness to life without both sides. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: "Self-Made Man" is about a future society where you can buy genes to really 
remake yourself. Are you optimistic or pessimistic about the future? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Yes, "Self-Made Man" is a kind of an exception in a way to the rest of the 
album . . . a completely imaginary scenario. It's about a possible future where 
instead of dealing crack on the black market, they are dealing little vials of 
genes. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Am I optimistic? I'm optimistic that there is still a lot of creativity out 
there . . . especially in other countries. That is incredibly stimulating and 
exciting. Politically and economically, I'm more of a pessimist. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How do you see yourself dividing your time over the next few years? Will 
you continue to be the "Renaissance man of rock," open to film or stage or 
classical music projects? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Dividing my time between records and other things is important for me. It 
gives ideas time to kind of germinate while you are working on something else. 
It also keeps you from feeling like you are on a treadmill. It keeps you open 
to new ideas and experiences. That's what keeps you alive . . . artistically.

ART WORLD MEETS THE TECHNO WORLD; THE ARTS: AN INTERNATIONAL GROUP OF MUSEUM 
DIRECTORS IS GATHERING IN SEATTLE TO PONDER THE TECHNOLOGICAL NEW AGE AND THE 
IMPACT ON INSTITUTIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUZANNE MUCHNIC, TIMES ART WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's a mind-boggling task, but somebody has to do it. So 115 directors and 
techno-whizzes from American, Canadian and Mexican art museums are taking a 
four-day journey into cyberspace. 
</P>
<P>
 They are abandoning their board meetings, budget sessions and curatorial 
conferences to attend a landmark meeting, starting today in Seattle, where 
members of the venerable Assn. of Art Museum Directors will ponder the 
technological future of their institutions. 
</P>
<P>
 The conference, "Art Museums on the Information Highway," is the first 
semiannual meeting of the 160-member, New York-based association to concentrate 
on advanced technology. It is also the first to invite press coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 The point of these breakthroughs, AAMD administrators say, is to face forward. 
</P>
<P>
 "We felt a need for a crash course on issues of technology," says Millicent 
Hall Gaudieri, AAMD executive director. "Technological changes are happening so 
fast, we need to become informed about the opportunities and challenges sooner 
rather than later. The highway has been built. If we aren't part of it, we will 
be bypassed." 
</P>
<P>
 Seattle had been selected for the organization's spring 1994 meeting before 
the theme was chosen, but the location is perfect for a discussion of digital 
technology, Gaudieri says. Microsoft Corp., the computer software giant, and 
its subsidiary, Continuum Corp., which has been buying nonexclusive digital 
reproduction rights to museums' art collections, are both located nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, the conference organizers pulled off something of a coup by 
persuading Microsoft chairman William H. Gates to deliver the keynote address, 
on Thursday night at the Seattle Asian Art Museum. 
</P>
<P>
 As for allowing the press in on the group's normally private deliberations, 
Gaudieri says: "In the past AAMD has been reactive. We have reacted to issues 
about de-accessioning (selling artworks from museums' collections) and to 
legislation in Congress. This is a great opportunity to be pro-active and to 
give the organization a new face." 
</P>
<P>
 The conference offers enough bells, whistles and weighty discussions to 
intrigue technology enthusiasts and skeptics alike. Interactive displays will 
demonstrate laser discs, CD-ROMs and other digital products developed by eight 
museums. Scheduled to show their wares are the National Gallery of Art in 
Washington, the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, the J. Paul Getty 
Museum in Malibu, the Seattle Art Museum, the Winterthur Museum in Delaware, 
the Minneapolis Institute of Arts, Emory University's Michael C. Carlos Museum 
in Atlanta and the Royal Ontario Museum in Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
 Panels will discuss legal and philosophical implications of information 
technology, current projects and plans for the future at various institutions. 
In addition, a dozen art museum luminaries will lecture on everything from 
copyright and licensing issues to "Portable Information Technology" and "Perils 
and Pleasures of the Virtual Museum." 
</P>
<P>
 In her speech, "Close Encounters: Defensive Driving on the Digital Highway," 
Marcia Tucker, director of New York's New Museum, intends to raise broad 
questions about how advanced technology changes perceptions of history, 
economy, geography, communication, time, space, communities and individuals. 
</P>
<P>
 The talk is "in no way anti-technology," Tucker says, but she plans to move 
beyond questions of how to get more terminals and interactive displays into 
museums. "I don't think about technology in terms of upgrading, but how it 
fundamentally and deeply changes culture," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 For Tucker, "It's not a question of being for or against technology." But many 
of her colleagues have serious reservations about the potential impact of the 
digital age on art museums. 
</P>
<P>
 "To a lot of directors, this is just video games -- and a terrible 
compromise," says conference chair Maxwell L. Anderson, who directs the Carlos 
Museum at Emory University. One of his primary concerns in planning the program 
was to "overcome general concern about compromising artistic standards and the 
ability of institutions to control the flow of information through technology," 
he says. 
</P>
<P>
 The first speakers at the conference will address legal and ethical issues "to 
get the hard stuff out of way," Anderson says. Meanwhile, interactive displays 
will show that "cutting-edge programs are not just being done by vendors but by 
the museums themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 The conference "did not spring from the head of Zeus," says AAMD president 
Evan M. Maurer, who directs the Minneapolis Institute of Arts. The association 
first addressed technology in 1989, as part of a program on museum education. 
Furthermore, many museums have developed computer and video programs to enhance 
visitors' understanding of the collections, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 The meeting may lead to networking and to the establishment of a standing 
committee on technology, AAMD officials say. But the most important long-range 
goal is to ensure that art museums chart their own course on the information 
highway.

COLUMBIA'S FILM DROUGHT; STUDIO HAS RELEASED ONLY TWO MOVIES SO FAR THIS YEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELAINE DUTKA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 More studio films are due to open in 1994 than in any year since 1988. But 
you'd never know it from looking at the Columbia Pictures schedule. During the 
first five months of this year, the studio distributed only two movies -- 
compared to seven during the same period in 1993. From mid-February through 
mid-June, when "City Slickers II" is due to hit the screens, not a single 
Columbia release will have surfaced. 
</P>
<P>
 The situation is unusual for a major Hollywood studio -- particularly one with 
pockets as deep as those of Sony Corp., which bought Columbia and TriStar 
Pictures in 1989. Though part of the dry spell can be chalked up to the fact 
that Mike Nichols' "Wolf" was pushed back from March to June, the four-month 
void, industry observers say, reflects a marked lack of depth. 
</P>
<P>
 "Various management changes have led to an ongoing transitional period, which 
can occasionally result in a thinning of the release schedule," says Lisbeth 
Barron, a senior vice president at S.G. Warburg, an investment management firm. 
"And Columbia obviously feels it's not prudent to rush what movies it has out. 
The caution also reflects the fact that Sony is watching the performance of its 
purchase with a lot of interest. The more familiar it becomes with the movie 
business, the more it realizes how volatile it is." 
</P>
<P>
 Columbia's refusal to reshuffle the schedule also reflects a lesson learned 
from last summer's "Last Action Hero" fiasco: As eager as the studio is to 
bolster its paltry 2.7% market share, release dates should not take precedence 
over everything else. 
</P>
<P>
 "We considered moving 'Karate Kid 4' and 'Blankman' up, but didn't want to 
panic," says Lisa Henson, Columbia's head of production. "Though the movies 
were far ahead of schedule, we needed time to build awareness." 
</P>
<P>
 It would be easy to assume that the failure of the $80-million-plus "Last 
Action Hero" -- along with other costly flops like "Lost in Yonkers," 
"Geronimo" and "I'll Do Anything" -- depleted last year's development and 
production budgets and led to the current shortfall. Not so, say industry 
analysts. Such funds, they point out, are allocated in advance. Though cash 
flow at Columbia was tight at times, the root of the problem was more creative 
than fiscal. 
</P>
<P>
 For starters, "Last Action Hero" consumed a disproportionate amount of time 
and energy -- studio denials to the contrary. ("The only impact was on our 
sleep patterns . . . and then only for a couple of months after testing began 
last May," insists Sidney Ganis, vice chairman of Columbia Pictures.) Mark 
Canton, chairman of Columbia/TriStar Pictures, was integrally involved in 
day-to-day production and post-production of the movie, which also turned into 
a major distraction for ex-production president Michael Nathanson and executive 
vice president of production Barry Josephson. 
</P>
<P>
 "A good six months before the release of the film last summer, Columbia was 
obsessed with making the movie and finishing it by the announced release date," 
observes entertainment lawyer David Colden. "Because the focus was on the 
present rather than the future, the studio wasn't as aggressive in developing 
material." 
</P>
<P>
 That was an oversight Columbia could ill afford, since, late in 1991, the 
studio had decided to place its bets on internal development instead of on the 
costly outside acquisition that characterized the early days of the Peter 
Guber-Jon Peters regime. No longer was it routinely laying out a fortune to buy 
star "packages" like "A League of Their Own" or $1 million to a first-time 
writer for "Radio Flyer," a box-office bomb. And several expensive projects 
haven't congealed as quickly as hoped. Getting a film greenlighted at Columbia 
has also been tough. Without an important relationship with a filmmaker in the 
Columbia family, a deal with the studio or heavy-duty A-list talent attached, a 
writer's chance of selling a project ranged from remote to none. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 This year, the studio will release 14 to 16 movies -- compared with 20 in 
1993. One-third of them, including three this summer, are produced by Castle 
Rock Entertainment, recently purchased by Ted Turner after negotiations between 
Columbia and the independent fizzled out. Castle Rock's domestic distribution 
deal with Columbia expires in 1997, provided it delivers the agreed-upon number 
of films by that date. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't blame it all on us," says a producer of Columbia's current plight. 
"It's very demoralizing. You can only be a 'volume' producer if the person 
buying says 'yes.' " 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes," by all accounts, was a rare occurrence under the regime of Sony 
Pictures president Alan Levine and ex-president of the Motion Picture Group 
Jonathan Dolgen, who recently left to become chairman of Viacom Entertainment 
Group. After sounding out Sony Pictures Entertainment chairman Peter Guber 
about the movies he wanted to make, Canton had to contend with the business 
end, where resistance -- to movies ranging from "Groundhog Day" and "The Age of 
Innocence" to "Geronimo" -- was a given. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every time out was a fight," recalls one executive. "Insisting that movies 
come in for $4 million or $5 million less than requested precluded getting the 
star power necessary for a green light. We lost a lot of opportunities to 
assemble movies." 
</P>
<P>
 Too many producers and too little access to what product there was contributed 
to the exodus of talent such as the Laurie MacDonald/Walter Parkes team and 
Michael Douglas. Yet Irwin Winkler ("Raging Bull") has no complaints. The 
studio recently shelled out $1.5 million for George Dawes Green's upcoming book 
"The Juror," plus a hefty sum to screenwriter Ted Tally ("Silence of the 
Lambs") for the screen adaptation Winkler is set to produce. 
</P>
<P>
 Last summer's arrival of Henson -- a Warner Bros. colleague of Canton and 
daughter of the late Jim Henson -- was both a shot in the arm and another bump 
on Columbia's production path. New management frequently discards the material 
of its predecessor -- and Henson is said to have been displeased with her 
inheritance. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't take all the high-profile projects and throw them away," Henson 
says. "The only movie that was derailed after I arrived was Barbet Schroeder's 
'Before and After.' Almost everything we're making was in some form of 
development already . . . and no four-month hiatuses are planned in the 
future." 
</P>
<P>
 The last couple of months have seen signs of a turnaround. Four films are 
before the cameras and two others are due to start by late July. Kenneth 
Branagh's "Sense and Sensibility" -- written by and starring Emma Thompson -- 
was greenlighted two weeks ago. Columbia producer Doug Wick ("Wolf"), for one, 
is optimistic: "We've got a great boat and a big sail -- and the wind is on the 
rise." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If Winkler detects a "discernible lift" in Columbia's spirits, those at 
TriStar are flagging. Though the sister studio has released six films this year 
for a 9% market share, there's the feeling that Canton -- who took over from 
studio chief Mike Medavoy in January -- has concentrated more on his initial 
charge than on his newly adopted one. 
</P>
<P>
 TriStar President Marc Platt and head of production Stacey Snider were said to 
be frustrated by Canton's lack of organization and the difficulty of getting 
projects approved. But with Mike Newell's "Old Friends" and the big-budget 
"Jumanji" given a "go" in recent weeks, Platt says he's encouraged. 
</P>
<P>
 "The success of Sony depends on the success of both studios," says the 
executive. "And now that Mark has had time to familiarize himself with 
TriStar's projects, people and process, he's become a very effective leader." 
</P>
<P>
 If Canton has his hands full, industry veterans say this, too, will pass. The 
film industry is basically an endurance test, they observe, in which today's 
crises become yesterday's news. 
</P>
<P>
 "While a four-month vacuum is not a good sign, neither does it have to be 
life-threatening," says Harold Vogel, an entertainment industry analyst with 
Merrill Lynch and Co. "All you need is a big movie or two. Universal was way 
down in market share and, after 'Jurassic Park' and 'Schindler's List,' shot 
right up again."

IT'S BEGINNING TO FEEL A LOT MORE LIKE BAROQUE; FESTIVAL: AFTER 14 YEARS 
WITHOUT, THE EVENT WILL EMPLOY PERIOD INSTRUMENTS FOR TWO OF ITS FOUR CONCERTS. 
</P>

<P>
 The Corona del Mar Baroque Music Festival, which some would say should have 
been among the first to do so, is finally embracing period instruments. 
</P>
<P>
 Sort of. 
</P>
<P>
 Only half of the four concerts, the opening and closing orchestral events that 
festival director Burton Karson conducts at St. Michael & All Angels Church, 
will use older-style instruments. The two middle concerts, which will feature 
chamber performances, will be held at Sherman Library and Gardens. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason for only doing half the series with period instruments is simple. 
Karson said the artists he wanted for the middle chamber programs happen to 
employ modern instruments. 
</P>
<P>
 So why did even this tenuous foray into instrumental authenticity take 14 
years? 
</P>
<P>
 "The honest answer is that now I can, that good instrumentalists are 
available," Karson explained. "In earlier years when I had entertained the 
thought, the Baroque instrumentalists that I had heard were not (playing) in 
tune, not really very good. I don't care how accurate they were in some ways, 
(the music they make) has to sound beautiful." 
</P>
<P>
 This year, the schedule is as follows:  
</P>
<P>
 * Sunday: The weeklong festival opens with a program of concertos for flauto 
traverso ("wood, but not to be confused with a recorder," said Karson); arch 
lute ("the big lute, with 25 strings, it has to be tuned a lot"); harpsichord, 
and other Baroque instruments. 
</P>
<P>
 * June 8: "Music in the Gardens" reprises the festival's 1988 production of 
Adriano Banchieri's "Barca di Venetia per Padova (Gondola from Venice to 
Padua)," 20 madrigals for five vocalists, cellist, harpsichordist and and 
narrator. 
</P>
<P>
 * June 10: Ensemble and unaccompanied sonatas will feature flutist Louise Di 
Tullio and violinist Clayton Haslop.  
</P>
<P>
 * June 12: The Festival Orchestra and Singers and vocal soloists conclude the 
series with Handel's Dixit Dominus, Alessandro Scarlatti's Concerto Grosso in F 
Major and Magnificat, and Bach's cantata, Nun komm der Heiden Heiland. 
</P>
<P>
 The "period" instruments that will be heard are actually replicas made, 
according to Karson, "absolutely to the specifications" of 17th- and 
18th-Century instruments. 
</P>
<P>
 "The antique instruments, the Stradivarius violins we hear today, were all 
altered in the 19th Century," Karson noted. "The necks were made longer; steel 
strings were used, the bows were different."  
</P>
<P>
 When music is played on period replicas, he said, "It's not just that people 
will hear a gentler sound and lower pitch. Held notes have a different shape. 
Different accents come out. The feeling of flow in the music is different."  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Violins and flauto traversos won't be the only replicas at the festival: On 
stage during the Banchieri performance will be a replica gondola. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's big enough so that when the singers sit behind it, it seems as if 
they're in the boat," Karson said. "It's a charming excursion and a very 
humorous piece." The performance will feature English narration, "with only a 
slight Italian accent," by Massimo Navarretta, Italian-born owner of Amici 
restaurant in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Karson, the advantage of using period instruments, or replicas, 
is not only creating historically appropriate sound; the players are also more 
aware of stylistic subtleties. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm trusting that I won't have to describe to them how to play ornaments," 
Karson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I draw on players who are absolutely splendid, but whose experience is 
almost completely with the modern orchestra, I have to describe the difference 
between a trill and mordent, (I have to explain) that in an appoggiatura the 
dissonant tone is more important and the resolution is softer, not louder. I 
really have to rehearse these things!" 
</P>
<P>
 And it's really hard to imagine that absolutely splendid players aren't taught 
those things in music school. 
</P>
<P>
 "They hear about it, in some cases," Karson said. "But most of the time, they 
perform the music as the edition or the teacher tells them to. They memorize a 
piece by Bach, Handel or Telemann, then perform it. They don't think 
stylistically.  
</P>
<P>
 "If at the very last minute you feel the need, with the period players you can 
say, 'Wonderful, let's do that'; you can say, 'Let's put a mordent there; it 
would be very good to echo that,' and they'll do it. Not a trill, a mordent. 
And they'll actually do it!" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 According to Karson, using both types of instruments at the festival is not a 
case of historically informed fence-sitting. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think it sends a mixed message, because we're not actually mixing 
them," Karson explained. "Different rooms, different repertoire, different 
players. . . . It will be an interesting experience for our subscribers, and 
I'm sure we'll have a verbal vote. I'm going to be listening myself, not only 
to the music but to the comments of our patrons. And maybe even the critics." 
</P>
<P>
 * The Corona del Mar Baroque Music Festival takes place Sunday and June 12 at 
4 p.m. at St. Michael & All Angels Episcopal Church, 3233 Pacific View Drive, 
Corona del Mar. On June 8 and 10 at 8 p.m., the site shifts to Sherman Library 
and Gardens, 2645 East Coast Highway, Corona del Mar. Tickets, $20-$25; series

A BETTER SHOT AT STATE GRANTS 
</P>

<P>
 All three Orange County theater troupes seeking state funding have been given 
stronger grant recommendations this year than last by a California Arts Council 
advisory panel. 
</P>
<P>
 The panel, which met last week in Sacramento, upped the rankings used to 
determine grant amounts: Costa Mesa's South Coast Repertory went from 4-minus 
to 4 (the top score on a 1-to-4 scale); and Laguna Playhouse and Fullerton 
Civic Light Opera both went from 3-minus to 3. 
</P>
<P>
 The higher ranks do not necessarily mean larger grants, because the CAC's 
overall budget has not yet been determined. Last year SCR was awarded $57,765, 
Fullerton Civic Light Opera received $4,705, and Laguna Playhouse was awarded 
$5,984. 
</P>
<P>
 The panel also gave the Santa Ana-based Orange County Crazies comedy group, in 
its first try for a CAC grant, a 2-minus. Typically, the CAC gives funds only 
to groups ranked 3 or above. ZAN DUBIN

 Schedule conflict -- It was reported in a Morning Report item on Tuesday that 
Julia Louis-Dreyfus was passed up for the movie "Stranger Things."In fact, she 
was offered the role first without an audition. She turned it down because of 
scheduling problems. Other actresses were then auditioned for the part.

 A crash course in mouth-to-beak resuscitation: Tina Rosen's blue parakeet has 
had a scary year (and it's only June). 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently left homeless by the Jan. 17 earthquake, the bird first encountered 
Rosen four days later. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I came to work, she flew up and made a little nest in my hair," Rosen 
recalled. "She could tell that I love birds." 
</P>
<P>
 Rosen, who lives in Sherman Oaks, adopted the feathered refugee and named her 
Tremor. Then came another type of shock. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosen was washing some clothes in the kitchen sink while the parakeet was out 
of her cage. 
</P>
<P>
 "I went into another room for a few minutes and when I came out, there was 
water everywhere," she said. "I looked into the sink and she was spread-eagled. 
I grabbed her out of the water but her claws were connected to some clothing. 
She must have gotten trapped. She was stiff but I could hear her just barely 
rasping. 
</P>
<P>
 "I put her little head in my mouth and blew air lightly into her mouth for 
five or 10 minutes. After a while there was less of the raspy noise and I could 
hear her breathing. Finally, she perked her head up, gave a high tweet and 
flapped her wings to get the water off." 
</P>
<P>
 And now? 
</P>
<P>
 "She's as good as new," Rosen said. "She's more vivacious than she ever was, 
especially when she sees me. The way she was looking at me when I was giving 
her air -- she knew. She wouldn't die." 
</P>

 Wouldn't this practice reduce repeat business?Jerry Littman of Valley Village

 Postal paradise: United Press International columnist Cynthia Littleton, who 
has noticed our mentions about one local city's uncanny way of popping up in 
national news items, has still another example. 
</P>
<P>
 A yearlong survey of 30,000 post offices by Price Waterhouse found that Long 
Beach has the best delivery record in the nation -- a 91% success rate at 
getting first-class mail to customers within 24 hours of its arrival in the 
city. The national average is 79%. 
</P>
<P>
 So, obviously, Groucho Marx should have excluded Long Beach when he made this 
joke about one postal workers strike: "We give them a pay raise -- but we mail 
it to them." 
</P>

 He left his cell in San Francisco: A kit sent by an L.A. tourist office to the 
San Francisco County Jail was returned because the interested inmate had moved 
to a new address. Sounds like slow mail service -- unless the inmate departed 
without the jail's permission. miscelLAny:
