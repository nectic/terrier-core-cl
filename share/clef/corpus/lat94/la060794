 New KABC Anchor: ABC News anchor and correspondent Lisa McRee will replace 
former anchor Ann Martin on the Channel 7 Eyewitness News team starting in 
July. McRee will co-anchor the 5 and 11 p.m. newscasts with Harold Greene. 
McRee has been an anchor for "World News Now" and a correspondent for "Day 
One." Veteran broadcaster Martin left KABC last month to become an anchor at 
KCBS Channel 2.

 Going to Israel: Actress Vanessa Redgrave, whose outspoken support for the 
Palestine Liberation Organization has incensed many Israelis, will make her 
stage debut in Israel next month. She will appear at Jerusalem's Haifa Theatre 
in "Brecht in Exile," a selection of works written by German playwright Bertolt 
Brecht while he was in exile from Nazi Germany. Oded Kutler, the theater's 
director, said the Academy Award-winning actress agreed to the visit as a 
result of the Israel-PLO peace accords. Redgrave's statements, including a call 
on her show-business colleagues in the 1980s to boycott Israel and a picture of 
her toting an assault rifle and dancing with Palestinians, are notorious in 
Israel.

 * 'Perestroika' Wins in N.Y.: "Angels in America: Perestroika," the second 
half of playwright Tony Kushner's epic about AIDS in the 1980s, was named best 
play of the New York theater season by the theater critics' group Drama Desk. 
Last year, Kushner won the same prize for the first half of the drama, "Angels 
in America: Millennium Approaches." Stephen Spinella, who plays a man living 
with AIDS in "Perestroika," won for best actor. He also won the featured-actor 
prize last year for "Millennium Approaches." The top winner in Sunday night's 
ceremonies, however, was the new Stephen Sondheim/James Lapine musical 
"Passion," which won six awards including best musical, lyrics, music and book.

 * It's a Wrap: The Spoleto Festival U.S.A. wrapped up its first season without 
founder Gian Carlo Menotti on Sunday, with the critical consensus being that 
the festival was none the worse for the Pulitzer Prize-winning composer's 
absence. With a shortened 12-day run, the Charleston, S.C., festival ended up 
on solid financial ground, with organizers estimating final ticket sales would 
come in near their goal of $1.6 million. The festival's total fund-raising 
ended about $150,000 shy of its $3.2-million goal, but a spokeswoman said that 
gap should be closed by the end of the fiscal year in August. The debt at the 
end of last season was almost $1 million; organizers hope to lower that to 
$600,000 by year's end. ART

today's primary election. Proposition 180, a $2-billion statewide parks and 
wildlife bond act known as CALPAW, includes a $10-million grant to "a qualified 
nonprofit organization" that would operate the fledgling institution. The 
Latino Museum was founded in 1989 when the California Legislature voted to 
grant it $300,000 in seed money.

TV REVIEW; 'FRONTLINE' EXAMINES IMMIGRATION FEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT KOEHLER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The illegal immigrant story is probably too big to examine in one television 
hour, and so it's a strength of the "Frontline" report, "Go Back to Mexico!," 
that it doesn't aim for comprehensiveness. Instead, it takes the form of a 
personal essay by reporter William Langewiesche, who once flew the Southern 
California-Mexico border area as an air-taxi pilot. He has seen the land from 
above, where there's no border to be seen. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the border is very real, and Langewiesche is passionately interested in 
what makes nice, family people risk their lives and break the law to cross that 
border, and what fears exist among Americans who feel that those people are 
somehow changing the country's identity. He is a thoughtful liberal in the 
old-fashioned sense, taking in every point of view, absorbing them and trying 
to make sense of them. 
</P>
<P>
 Running through the essay is the adventure of 24-year-old Maria Salas, who 
leaves her poverty-striken town of Agua Verde with her son, Jesus, to reunite 
with her husband in Los Angeles. Along the way, we see every impediment erected 
in their way north -- the border patrol's infra-red cameras, the tall fences, 
high-powered night lights, the beefed-up checking of doctored ID cards -- but 
Maria and Jesus elude all of them. How? She simply rides in the front seat of a 
smuggler's car crossing the main Tijuana border checkpoint. 
</P>
<P>
 Langewiesche also has the novel idea of visiting a San Diego talk-radio 
station, listening to callers complaining about the illegals, and then 
personally visiting the callers. Their concerns aren't abstract, but always 
personally grounded. Mexico's problems, one unemployed man says, shouldn't have 
to be mine. 
</P>
<P>
 Langewiesche understands him; it would have been good to hear this reporter 
add that the ultimate solution to the unprecedented rush of immigrants across 
the southern border is a wealthier Mexico. The other solutions carry the 
resounding thud of futility -- illegal immigrant prisons, Berlin Wall-like 
erections, more patrolling guards, laminated national ID cards. They're futile, 
he argues, because there's always some way to be found around them. Desperate 
people will find it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Go Back to Mexico!" airs such immediate concerns as the alleged abuses of 
California's welfare and health systems by illegal immigrants, but it's best at 
reflecting on what the fear of new immigrants by a nation of immigrants says 
about the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Go Back to Mexico!" airs at 9 tonight on KCET-TV Channel 28 and KPBS-TV 
Channel 15, and at 8 p.m. on KVCR-TV Channel 24.

 The 19th hole: Residents of Belmont Heights were shocked to see three joy 
riders careening down their streets -- and sidewalks -- and occasionally 
crashing into each other late one recent night. The revelers were at the wheel 
of golf carts taken from a nearby course. Long Beach police were summoned, but 
by the time they arrived the thieves had fled on foot. They apparently chose 
not to attempt an escape in the vehicles -- and thereby risk a low-speed chase.

 Then there's the Normandie anniversary: City records indicate that this year

 By 1869, L.A. had had one mayor with French roots (Damien Marchessault) and 
was the site of a French immigrant settlement that included French Hospital in 
present-day Chinatown. The hospital, now called Pacific Alliance Medical 
Center, still has a statue of Jean d'Arc in front.

<P>
 Although tuberculosis cases declined slightly in Los Angeles County last year, 
the disease is still a threat. The month of June has been declared Tuberculosis 
Awareness Month by the American Lung Assn. of Los Angeles County, the county 
Board of Supervisors and the county Department of Health Services. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, the number of new reported TB cases in the county jumped dramatically 
and in 1993 there was a 12% decrease. But TB continues to be a public health 
problem, spread from person to person through the air. 
</P>
<P>
 Homelessness is a major factor in the continuing problem, but other people -- 
such as the undernourished, nursing home residents, people infected with the 
HIV virus and those who live or work with TB patients -- are also at risk.  
</P>
<P>
 Health officials from the state, county and the American Lung Assn. have 
developed plans to help stop the spread of the disease. During June, 
representatives will work in the community to educate health care providers, 
policy makers and members of the community to eventually eradicate TB. For 
information on tuberculosis or ways to help control the disease, call the 
American Lung Assn. at (213) 935-LUNG or (818) 797-LUNG.

OFFICIALS EXAMINE DISTURBING QUAKE REPAIR DATA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HUGO MARTIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The failure of quake repair methods for steel-frame buildings prompted 
concerns and questions Monday for city officials and building owners faced with 
the repair of broken beams and joints on dozens of Los Angeles high-rises. 
</P>
<P>
 Tests by the University of Texas at Austin cast serious doubt on the 
effectiveness of retrofitting recommended by the Los Angeles Department of 
Building and Safety, causing city officials and high-rise owners to wonder 
aloud how to proceed with repairs to quake-damaged steel-frame buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 Geoff Ely, executive director of the Building Owners and Managers Assn., 
representing about 1,500 members throughout Los Angeles County, called a Times 
report Monday of the tests "disturbing." 
</P>
<P>
 But Ely said he cannot gauge the impact to building owners until more 
information about the tests is released. "This only indicates to us that this 
issue is more complicated than we originally estimated," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ely and city officials hoped to get some questions answered at a meeting late 
Monday between city building officials and representatives of the American 
Institute of Steel Construction, which ordered the tests. The meeting at a 
convention of the institute was closed to the public and news media. 
</P>
<P>
 The test results and other information are expected to be released at a news 
conference today. (Tuesday). 
</P>
<P>
 Steel-frame office buildings, designed to bend with the forces of an 
earthquake, were considered among the safest in riding out a temblor. But after 
the Northridge quake, building experts were shocked to find cracking on welded 
connections of beams and columns of at least 90 buildings, mostly in the San 
Fernando Valley and on the Westside. 
</P>
<P>
 Results of the Texas study -- the main effort to find a solution to the 
problem -- disturb experts because the welding methods and design changes 
tested are currently being used to make repairs to quake-damaged high-rises and 
in new construction. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles City Council voted in May to draft an ordinance that would 
require the owners of steel-frame buildings to inspect the buildings for damage 
within three months of notification by the city. Repairs, using the methods 
questioned by the Texas tests, would have to be completed within one year after 
they are recommended by inspectors, under the proposed ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Holguin, assistant chief of the city's building bureau and head of a 
city panel that studied quake damage to steel-frame buildings, said, "it's 
still too early to tell" what the tests will mean to the city's recommended 
repair program. 
</P>
<P>
 But if the tests are accurate, Holguin said, the "repairs that are being 
recommended do not appear to provide a permanent correction." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilfred Iwan, ,chairman of the California Seismic Safety Commission, said he 
had not received any information on the Texas tests and is eager to have more 
information so the commission can complete a set of changes to the state's 
building codes requested by Gov. Pete Wilson after the Jan. 17 quake. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's important for that report to get out," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 When Iwan read The Times report on the tests Monday, he said many questions 
came to his mind about how the tests were conducted and what recommendations 
will be made as a result. 
</P>
<P>
 "Clearly there is a potential for a huge problem," he said. "What it may be 
saying is you have to be careful of quick solutions." 
</P>
<P>
 The Texas test used life-sized columns and horizontal beams that were welded 
together in California and shipped to the University of Texas, where a 
hydraulic arm was used to shake the beam, simulating a quake. 
</P>
<P>
 After the steel frames were strengthened with plates and welds, some 
connections nonetheless broke after the beams had been shaken up and down just 
once. 
</P>
<P>
 Greig Smith, chief of staff for Councilman Hal Bernson, who recommended the 
inspection and repair program for the city, said he had not heard of the Texas 
tests and could not comment on the results. But he added that there is still 
time to amend the city repair program to include whatever recommendations city 
building officials make as a result of the tests. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's repair recommendations to the owners of steel-frame buildings were 
based on engineering simulations conducted before the temblor. These showed 
that joints reinforced in certain ways, usually with steel plates, performed 
better than those built to the current code. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said owners of about 30 steel-frame buildings have taken out 
permits to make repairs, and about half of the repairs have been completed. 
</P>
<P>
 Ely, of the building owners association, could not say how many steel-frame 
buildings within his group have begun the repair work recommended by the city. 
But he added that whatever repairs are under way probably will be completed 
regardless of the test findings. 
</P>
<P>
 "The repairs under way provide more public safety than not having any 
repairs," he said.

 Every so often my wife, Cinelli, pumps me full of culture by taking me to the 
kinds of musical performances I struggle to avoid. I suffer fugues poorly and 
don't know a barcarole from a barbell . . . but this time she mentioned Ojai. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a sweet little town for white people set among oak and sycamore trees in 
western Ventura County, about as far from L.A. as one can hide and still feel 
the city's nagging presence. 
</P>
<P>
 There is an overriding sense of serenity in Ojai that attracts those of us who 
otherwise spend our lives shouting obscenities out of car windows at other 
drivers on the Hollywood Freeway. We need peace and quiet. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, I almost had it. 
</P>
<P>
 By seducing me with Ojai's storied tranquillity, she got me to attend its 
weekend music festival. Even that held an element of attraction. Like a sailor 
lured to disaster by naked, harp-strumming sirens on a rocky shoreline, I 
respond to music in limited forms. 
</P>
<P>
 "You like to hum," Cinelli said in her effort to convince me. "You hum all the 
time, no matter what. Just think of this as two days of humming, accompanied by 
the New World Symphony Orchestra." 
</P>
<P>
 "I normally don't hum arias from 'Die Fledermaus,' " I said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not to worry, that's not in the program. Maybe they'll have music you can 
understand. Like 'Ragtime Cowboy Joe' or the theme from 'Cheers.' " 
</P>
<P>
 So off we drove, humming and cursing, northward from the dreaded L.A., toward 
a snippet of heaven called (say it pianissimo) . . . Ojai. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Let me tell you right off that our music critic, Martin Bernheimer, writes 
calmly and knowledgeably of the performances elsewhere in the paper, so if you 
want real information, turn quickly to his work before it's too late. I write, 
well, impressions. 
</P>
<P>
 My impression of the, God help us, "new American music" presented in 
tree-shaded Libbey Park, for instance, is that it was written expressly for 
people from L.A. who cannot exist without a daily intake of chaos. 
</P>
<P>
 The condition is known in psychiatric circles as the Bell and Whistle Syndrome 
and is found only among those who have lived more than 10 years amid the filth 
and calamity of a big city. 
</P>
<P>
 Since most of the 5,000 music lovers who come to the festival every spring are 
from L.A., it is only natural that part of the program be tailored specifically 
for us. To employ a musical term, we bring in the do-re-mi. 
</P>
<P>
 No, they don't litter the park with empty beer cans or fire Uzis over our 
heads to make us feel at home, but they do give us noise in the form of music, 
or music in the form of noise, depending on how you look at it. 
</P>
<P>
 Take the piece called "Phorion, From Baroque Variations" by Lukas Foss. 
Festival director Joan Kemper told me earlier that people come to Ojai seeking 
a return to memories of simpler times, when you could go to a park, sit on the 
lawn and listen to music. 
</P>
<P>
 "Phorion" was more like a memory of D-day, with bells and whistles and drums 
and whizzy toys and horns blasting hellfire into the sky. Even the sirens of 
passing fire engines fit perfectly into the tuneless cacophony. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are clapping," Cinelli said in its defense. "They loved it." 
</P>
<P>
 "People clap at suicides from tall buildings," I said. "They love that too." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I'm no expert on new music, so a lot of what I heard at Ojai was probably over 
my head, like these lyrics from an aria called "The Love of My Life": 
</P>
<P>
 "The love of my life is just five monosyllables/Ticking my minutes, striking 
my hours:/Ding dong damn die tit come bell go wait reach touch lose . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 "What the hell does that mean?" I whispered to Cinelli during the performance. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just what it says," she whispered back. 
</P>
<P>
 "It means 'Ding dong damn die tit come bell go?' " 
</P>
<P>
 "Just sit quietly and play with your crayons. It'll be over soon and I'll take 
you to see 'The Flintstones.' " 
</P>
<P>
 She didn't take me to a movie, but she did take me to a bar across the street 
called the Hub, where I had me a Budweiser beer and shot a little snooker with 
a guy who said "yabba-dabba-doo" when he rammed the four-ball into a corner 
pocket. 
</P>
<P>
 Two days of culture may be too much for me. I love Ojai, and some of the 
quieter pieces did indeed damp the fires of negativity burning in my mottled 
old soul. Like the music of Paula Robison's flute spun like gold among the 
trees on a starry night. 
</P>
<P>
 But I was glad to get back to L.A., too. Having someone honk at me and give me 
the finger makes me feel at home. At least I know what they mean.

BOOING FUROR AT ARTS HIGH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In response to "School Furor Mirrors L.A.'s Struggles With Diversity," May 30: 
 
</P>
<P>
 I applaud the officials of L.A. County High School for the Arts for allowing 
the outspoken play parodying Gov. Pete Wilson, but am equally abhorred by their 
reaction to the protest of teacher Don Bondi. 
</P>
<P>
 Bondi's booing of the play and the expression of his opinion in calling it 
"tasteless" are deserving of protection. Bondi's actions were an exercise of 
free speech, just as the play was. It seems the school is promoting a double 
standard and in the process presenting an unreal view of the criticism that is 
to be expected when students eventually produce a work in the "real" world. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem of diversity is not a racial or ethnic one. The challenge is in 
learning to allow opinions to be expressed that are unpalatable to those in 
authority. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 After reading your article, I couldn't help but wonder why it wasn't school 
board member Maria Elena Gaitan -- instead of Bondi -- who lost her job. 
</P>
<P>
 Bondi's verbal objection to a questionable theater piece drew cries of racism 
from Gaitan. To accuse any person -- let alone a public educator -- of racism 
on the basis of his opinions of an artwork is not only reckless and 
irresponsible but shows an utter contempt for the real race problems that face 
our troubled society. Bondi might have waited until the production was over to 
voice his opinion, but I strongly doubt Gaitan would have reacted any 
differently had he done so. 
</P>
<P>
 As a student of music, I have long believed that one of the most important 
qualities in a teacher of the arts is his willingness to be honest in his 
judgment of students' work. Without such openness, high artistic standards 
cannot be maintained.  
</P>
<P>
 Gaitan and others like her flippantly slap the racist label on anyone who 
differs with their political agenda. I'm not sure which is worse -- that 
someone could lose his job over his reaction to a student play, or that someone 
like Gaitan is in a position to have him fired. 
</P>

 JOHN LONG

</P>
<P>
 The reassignment of Bondi, chairman of the dance department at Arts High, is 
an outrageous assault on freedom of speech, creative freedom and the arts. It 
is also a vicious attack on a compassionate, caring artist/teacher who set high 
standards and encouraged excellence in his students. 
</P>
<P>
 As a parents of a young African American dancer who graduated last year from 
Arts High, we know Bondi and this school well. It is a jewel in the Los Angeles 
County school system, a school with a zero drop-out rate, a school with an 
extraordinary ethnic mix, a school where students are so highly motivated that 
some travel more than two hours twice a day to attend classes, a school that 
challenges young people to develop their creative talents, to think for 
themselves and to form character-building skills and discipline that will stay 
with them for the rest of their lives.  
</P>
<P>
 It is the Arts High teachers like Don Bondi who create the nourishing 
environment where students can express themselves openly and freely, without 
fear of reprisal, as they explore themselves and develop their own voice, their 
own unique artistic vision. To squelch a teacher for expressing his opinion 
sets an example that contradicts everything that the arts, education and, 
indeed, democratic institutions stand for.  
</P>
<P>
 Bondi's enemies may be well-meaning, but they should learn to control their 
totalitarian impulses.

 Members of AHORA are highly disturbed by the past and more recent conduct of 
Don Bondi, and about the failure of the Los Angeles County High School for the 
Arts to integrate racial and ethnic minorities into the mainstream of their 
curriculum and into professional positions. We are particularly distressed 
about the price students of all cultures have paid for this institutional 
failure, and note that art is political, especially when people of color are 
excluded and are therefore silenced.  
</P>
<P>
 Without a doubt, Bondi should be immediately released from his position for 
unprofessional conduct, failure to act as a teacher when booing young students 
as they attempt to gain self-confidence and self-esteem in the honored art form 
of the theater. We recognize that Gov. Wilson is not the issue, nor is booing. 
The issue is that Bondi did this while employed as a teacher. He abused his 
position when he engaged in an attempt to censor, and set a costly and negative 
example for white students who should be learning to live in a multicultural 
world.

 Thank you for your excellent article about Bondi's trouble at Arts High. This 
is a disturbing illustration of the negative aspect of multiculturalism. I 
particularly like Rudy Perez's comments: "Being an art school means being 
different from other public schools. It should have nothing to do with race. It 
should be about individuals. When I grew up in New York . . . we all considered 
ourselves Americans."

BROWN LEGACY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Times' review of the decision in Brown vs. Topeka (May 15) presents an 
overall picture that "Brown's beacon has dimmed," and there is no doubt this is 
a realistic assessment. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, the picture is one-sided. It leaves out the fact that there is a 
strong and continued faith in desegregation, and perhaps for integrated 
education in these United States, albeit unrecognized in our courts, in 
Congress and in official boards of education throughout our country. 
</P>
<P>
 It is extremely important, I believe, to acknowledge the validity of the 
statement of the U.S. Supreme Court's 1954 decision in its memorable, unanimous 
opinion, holding: 
</P>
<P>
 "Segregation of white and colored children in public schools has a detrimental 
effect upon the colored children" and, "Whatever may have been the extent of 
psychological knowledge at the time of Plessy vs. Ferguson, this finding is 
amply supported by modern authority." 
</P>
<P>
 Part of that authority stems from the work of the late Otto Klineberg of 
Columbia and his students. I was one of them, with a thesis (1932) titled "A 
Study of the Effect of Environment on the Binet IQ Scores of Ten-Year-Old Negro 
Boys." That study concluded that the longer Negro boys from the South were 
educated in the northern schools such as those in New York City, the higher 
their IQs. 
</P>
<P>
 The Klineberg studies had a direct effect on the reasoning of the Supreme 
Court in holding that segregation of black children meant inferior education. 
That is still our problem, as our major cities become more and more black and 
brown. Los Angeles is no exception, as the Crawford desegregation case so amply 
proved !

TIMES ENDORSEMENTS IN TODAY'S ELECTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 T he Times policy is to endorse selectively, on a case-by-case basis. Only 
those races in which this newspaper is endorsing in today's election are listed 
below. We are taking a position in only one statewide race, for superintendent 
of public instruction, because it is the only nonpartisan statewide contest. 
The Times normally does not endorse in partisan primaries in statewide races. 
State Offices 
</P>
<P>
 State Superintendent of Public Instruction -- DELAINE EASTIN. The Fremont 
assemblywoman offers the experience and legislative savvy needed for this 
important post.  
</P>
<P>
 Propositions 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 175 (Renter's Income Tax Credit): NO. This measure would embed the 
renter's tax credit in the state Constitution and require a two-thirds vote to 
change it. Not prudent. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 176 (Tax Break/Nonprofit Organizations: NO. Would amend the 
Constitution to exempt qualifying nonprofit organizations from locally imposed 
business license taxes or fees based on income or gross receipts. Amend the 
Constitution for this? 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 177 (Tax Break/Disabled Person's Access): YES. Federal law 
requires owners of commercial properties that are open to the public to make 
improvements for disabled persons. But by complying with that law, owners can 
be penalized with higher taxes for their improved properties. Proposition 177 
would amend the Constitution to exempt such future structural modifications. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 178 (Tax Break/Water Conservation): YES. Similar to Proposition 
177, this measure would exempt new water conservation equipment installed on 
agricultural land from property tax reassessment until that land is sold. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 179 (Murder Punishment): YES. This measure increases the minimum 
sentence for second-degree murder resulting from a drive-by shooting from 15 to 
20 years. (The proposition amends an earlier constitutional amendment; of 
course all of this should have been done by the Legislature and not by 
constitutional revision). 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 180 (Park Bonds): YES. The 1994 Parks and Wildlife Initiative 
authorizes up to $1.98 billion in general obligation bonds for state parks. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 1A (Earthquake Bonds): YES. Provides $2 billion to meet 
earthquake-related needs, including repairing or rebuilding schools and other 
public buildings, utilities and streets and roads damaged in the Jan. 17 quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 1B (K-12 Bonds): YES. Makes available $1 billion for construction, 
reconstruction and modernization projects at elementary and secondary schools 
throughout California. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 1C (Higher Education Bonds): YES. Authorizes the state to borrow 
$900 million for capital investment in higher education, including earthquake 
retrofitting. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County Offices 
</P>
<P>
 (Nonpartisan) 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor District 1: GLORIA MOLINA. Molina is running unopposed for a 
reason: She represents her constituents well and has given county government a 
much-needed shake-up. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor District 3: ZEV YAROSLAVSKY. The experienced Los Angeles City 
Council member is the best choice to represent the Westside and parts of the 
San Fernando Valley, replacing retiring Supervisor Ed Edelman. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff: SHERMAN BLOCK. Block, seeking his fourth term, has in his own quiet 
way tried to nudge reform along in a department that has had more than its 
share of trouble. The sheriff's community ties are improving, but need to 
improve even more. 
</P>
<P>
 Assessor: JOHN CARL BROGDON. The assessor's office, which determines property 
tax bills, has long suffered from serious leadership and morale problems. It is 
too important to be embroiled in pettiness. Brogdon, a retired veteran of the 
office, could bring needed calm and direction. 
</P>
<P>
 L.A. County Superior Court 
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court Office No. 2: TERRY B. FRIEDMAN. The state assemblyman was a 
lawyer at the Western Center of Law and Poverty and executive director of legal 
services at Bet Tzedek, which aids the elderly and poor. He has the patience, 
fairness and compassion to be an excellent judge. 
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court Office No. 4: TERI SCHWARTZ. Schwartz is a prosecutor with the 
hard-core gang division of the Los Angeles County district attorney's office. 
She has won the respect of lawyers and judges for her skill, intelligence and 
demeanor. 
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court Office No. 23: H. RONALD HAUPTMAN. Superior Court Commissioner 
Hauptman is a capable jurist, with 10 years of hearing mostly criminal cases.  
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court Office No. 39: RONALD S. COEN. This incumbent has a reputation 
as a tough, no-nonsense judge whose rulings have held up well on appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court Office No. 51: IRVING SHIMER. Judge Shimer, the author of 
widely used legal guidebooks, is known as knowledgeable, hard-working and fair. 
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court Office No. 93: MITCHELL BLOCK. Block, a municipal court 
commissioner for the last seven years, has heard criminal and civil matters. 
His experience gives him a slight edge. 
</P>
<P>
 Measures in L.A. County 
</P>
<P>
 Altadena -- Proposition A (Special Assessment): YES. Authorizes an annual 
special assessment for five years to provide funds for the Altadena Library 
District. 
</P>
<P>
 Downey -- Proposition C (Charter Amendment): YES. Amends the City Charter to 
make the date of municipal elections the same as state general elections in 
even-numbered years. 
</P>
<P>
 Hawthorne -- Proposition B (School Bond): YES. Provides for the issuing of $15 
million in Hawthorne School District bonds to fund safety and other 
improvements to school facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach -- Proposition M (Campaign Reform): YES. Would limit contributions, 
limit overall spending on a voluntary basis, provide limited public funding and 
impose strict rules of contribution disclosure. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Monica Proposition D (Adopts Civic Center Specific Plan): YES. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Monica Proposition E (Amends City's General Plan): YES. 
</P>
<P>
 These measures in tandem would act as a referendum on Santa Monica's Civic 
Center Specific Plan. The plan grew out of desires of the city, the county and 
the RAND Corp. to upgrade city-center facilities. RAND would pay $14.9 million 
for public improvements, and the city would spend $12.2 million to build a 
parking garage, with that money coming from tax revenue earmarked for 
transportation. A "yes" vote on Proposition D approves adoption of the plan; 
"yes" on Proposition E amends the city's general plan. For passage, both 
propositions must be approved. 
</P>
<P>
 South Pasadena Proposition L (Library Tax): YES. Institutes a five-year 
library special tax to maintain current services at South Pasadena's library. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Offices 
</P>
<P>
 (Nonpartisan) 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor 2nd District: LINDA MOULTON PATTERSON. Moulton Patterson is the 
mayor of Huntington Beach and also is serving with distinction as a member of 
the California Coastal Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor 4th District: WILLIAM STEINER. The appointed incumbent deserves a 
full term after serving out the remainder of Don Roth's term. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor 5th District: MARIAN BERGESON. Bergeson, a state senator, would 
offer a rare case of a freshman arriving with the mantle of leadership. 
</P>
<P>
 Assessor: BRAD JACOBS. Jacobs, the incumbent, has been slow in reassessing 
property during the recession but has some help now and is a far better bet 
than the in-house challengers. 
</P>
<P>
 Clerk-Recorder: GARY GRANVILLE. Granville, the county clerk, has cleaned up 
after incumbent Recorder Lee Branch before and can be counted on to do it again 
in this combined job. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge, West Muni Court: DANIEL C. DUTCHER. Dutcher, the incumbent, has some 
detractors, but his reputation for hard work and competence is established. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge, Central Orange County Muni Court: DENNIS PATRICK O'CONNELL. Many 
questions have been raised about incumbent Claude E. Whitney, who has been 
criticized for his handling of criminal defendants' rights and is under 
investigation by the State Judicial Council. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge, South County Muni Court: PAMELA L. ILES. Incumbent Iles is competent. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge, Superior Court: BARBARA (TAM) NOMOTO. Voters can't lose in this race 
between two well-regarded judges; Nomoto has the edge. 
</P>
<P>
 Public Administrator: WILLIAM A. BAKER. The incumbent is a solid performer in 
a low-profile post. 
</P>
<P>
 Treasurer-Tax Collector: ROBERT L. CITRON. Citron, the incumbent, has been 
getting a bum rap from the challenger. 
</P>
<P>
 Superintendent of Schools: JOHN DEAN. A reform superintendent, the incumbent 
has become a leader for education in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 State Assembly 
</P>
<P>
 (Primary) 
</P>
<P>
 70th District: MARILYN BREWER (Republican). Expect reasonable, moderate 
representation from this aide to outgoing Supervisor Tom Riley. 
</P>
<P>
 Recalls 
</P>
<P>
 Westminster: NO. Reject the recall of four City Council members over 
reductions in Fire Department budget. We prefer regular election cycles. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton: NO. Reject a recall of three City Council members and the city 
clerk over enactment of a utility tax. As in case of Westminster, regular 
election cycles are preferable.

SHOOTING OF BOY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I was very concerned with a comment made by the Los Angeles County Dist. 
Atty.Gil Garcetti in "Latinos Ask State Probe in Grocer's Shooting of Boy" (May 
24). The article states, "Kim had the legal right to arm himself and make a 
citizen's arrest if he believed a crime had been committed, Garcetti said . . . 
" Kim might have had the right to be armed but that still did not give him the 
right to shoot the 14-year-old boy, even if he had committed a crime. The 
grocer shouldn't have taken matters into his own hands. He should have let the 
police handle it. This is just another reason to get rid of guns everywhere.

ALL LOSE WHEN COPS RESORT TO BLACKMAIL; PUBLIC SAFETY: TIMES ARE TOUGH FOR THE 
LAPD, BUT IF WE LET THEM MANIPULATE ELECTED OFFICIALS, WE FORFEIT OUR FREEDOM. 
</P>

By XANDRA KAYDEN, Xandra Kayden, a senior fellow at the Institute for 
Leadership Studies at Loyola-Marymount University, is the author of Surviving 
Power (Free Press).

<TEXT>
<P>
 The notion that Los Angeles police are going to negotiate with the city 
through blackmail is a frightening thought and raises serious questions about 
whether we are living in a civil society or a police state. Maybe the police 
don't consider "soliciting adverse information on City Council members" -- as a 
spokesman for the Police Protective League announced on Friday -- to be 
blackmail, but I think the rest of us do, and it brings the potential for abuse 
of power by the police into very sharp focus. 
</P>
<P>
 The struggle going on between the elected city officials and the police union 
over a contract is sad, protracted and difficult. There is no question that the 
LAPD has a very tough job, and although most of us respect and rely on the 
police, they have gone through several rough years and suffered serious damage 
to their reputation. Too many have made mistakes, especially when it comes to 
minorities. But the violence on the streets today is unprecedented and it 
should not surprise us that police feel they are risking their lives without 
backing from the council and the new mayor they supported so strongly for 
election. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of their expectations may have been misplaced, not because Richard 
Riordan is any less supportive of the police today than he was a year ago, but 
because what he said he wanted to do supports the police force in the 
aggregate, but not necessarily at the individual level. The mayor said that he 
was going to increase the number of police on the street by hiring more and by 
getting officers who now hold desk jobs back out on the street. But when he 
said that he wanted money to hire additional police, the union complained that 
he would be better served by using that money to pay them more. Doubtless there 
is room for compromise, but it is a conflict in goals that was not quite so 
apparent a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Riordan -- and the Christopher Commission -- recommended putting desk 
officers back out on the street and providing incentives and recognition for 
officers who cover a beat. It's not hard to understand why officers holding 
desk jobs would resist a return to a beat -- if you spent your professional 
life striving to succeed, imagine the serious change in expectations and 
aspirations it would take for those currently working inside to feel happy 
about going back out on the street, especially when patrol is considered a 
dead-end job and is probably more dangerous today than it was five or 10 years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
 There are other factors: Police noted that in the city's settlement with the 
Department of Water and Power earlier this year, unions representing DWP 
workers won a 9% raise (police ignored the fact that the DWP has separate funds 
to pay for the increase and that no other city employees have won raises). 
Officers have been working for two years without a contract, and the constant 
tattoo of media attention following the never-ending trials stemming from the 
Rodney King beating has left them angry at the elected officials, angry at 
their own leaders. It is hard to believe that most LAPD officers support the 
harsh tactics their leadership is espousing, but they have already sent in a 
second team of negotiators who learned one important lesson from the first 
team: Don't give in. 
</P>
<P>
 Of all the crises Los Angeles has faced lately, this breakdown of civility and 
the negotiating process between the city and the police union threatens to be 
the most dangerous. Police power must be subservient to civil authority or we 
do not have a democracy. Threatening personal exposure of elected officials is 
a blatant abuse of police power and against the law. 
</P>
<P>
 The rest of the police "public relations" campaign is equally repugnant to a 
city struggling out of recession. We cannot afford to pass up national 
conventions or to menace sporting events such as the World Cup soccer matches 
and expect to encourage businesses to come or stay here. We need the tourists. 
We need the business. And we need peace within the government. There is, after 
all, a certain logic to the proposition that if there is less business, there 
is less tax money, and a decreased ability of the city to pay its employees. 
</P>
<P>
 There are remedies in law to settle the contract dispute. The City Council 
could -- and very likely will -- declare an impasse. At that point, the state 
will send a mediator to the city to listen to both sides. Once the mediator has 
exhausted the possibilities, the next step is fact-finding, in which case each 
side elects one fact-finder and those two select a third. That process could 
take months. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, if no agreement is reached, the city imposes a settlement and has 
the authority to give police officers immediate salary increases, something it 
cannot do now. But in the end, if that happens, the police will remain 
frustrated, the rest of the city's employees will be equally disheartened and 
morale will plunge even lower. 
</P>
<P>
 It is not enough to say that we need better leadership. Maybe we need to 
rethink what an urban police force can do and what it cannot do. Perhaps there 
are other alternatives for them and for the city, but the city must come first. 
Peace is critical, but so is freedom, and we lose our freedom if our elected 
officials are controlled by the police.

PERSPECTIVE ON CHINA; A GOOD DECISION; NOW THE HARD PART; NOW THAT MFN IS SET, 
WE NEED TO WORK WITH BEIJING ON VITAL STRATEGIC, ECONOMIC AND HUMAN-RIGHTS 
ISSUES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZBIGNIEW BRZEZINSKI and MICHEL OKSENBERG, Zbigniew Brzezinski was 
national-security adviser to President Jimmy Carter; Michel Oksenberg is 
president of the East-West Center in Honolulu. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Our recent, extensive conversations with Chinese leaders convince us that 
President Clinton's wise decision to continue most-favored-nation trading 
status for China while pressing for improvements in Beijing's human-rights 
record through other channels creates the opportunity to broaden and deepen 
Sino-American relations. 
</P>
<P>
 Follow-through is essential, however, if the opportunity is to be realized. By 
itself, the decision will neither ameliorate human-rights violations by Chinese 
authorities nor elicit cooperation in the strategic or economic spheres. 
</P>
<P>
 China's leaders, like many Asian leaders, doubt American resolve in the 
region. Some Chinese leaders suspect that the ultimate American objective is to 
destabilize and divide China; hence, as they see it, the Administration's 
emphasis on human rights and Tibet. 
</P>
<P>
 To elicit Chinese cooperation on matters of serious concern to us in the 
strategic, economic and human-rights area requires five measures. 
</P>
<P>
 * The United States must undertake intensified, broadly focused and regular 
dialogue with China's leaders. In the 1970s and early 1980s, the strategic 
dialogue between Washington and Beijing enabled both sides to approach 
transitory issues from a shared conceptual framework concerning the dangers of 
Soviet expansionism. That essential facet of Sino-American relations has 
disappeared. It must be restored. Such dialogue, for example, is essential to 
elicit Chinese cooperation in dissuading North Korea from developing nuclear 
weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 There is another reason for expanding consultations, especially between the 
Department of Defense and the Chinese military, a powerful actor in domestic 
affairs. Beijing is in an era of succession politics, and high-level contacts 
will yield information and influence at a decisive stage in China's evolution. 
</P>
<P>
 The strategic basis of Sino-American relations in the post-Cold War era is to 
be found in the intense interest of both Washington and Beijing in global and 
regional stability. Both China and the United States have crucial roles to play 
in the maintenance of stability in Korea. Both have important roles to play to 
ensure that all countries of the former Soviet Union emerge as truly 
independent and stable countries, and that the natural resources of Siberia and 
the Russian Far East be developed effectively and peacefully. Both have an 
interest in deterring an arms race in Asia and in maintaining the prosperity 
and stability of Taiwan and Hong Kong. 
</P>
<P>
 * The United States must now vigorously address such economic issues as 
protection of intellectual property rights in China and access to the service 
sector. While China has generally welcomed foreign direct investment, for 
example, it has protected its banks and insurance companies from foreign 
competition. It is reluctant to privatize its communication industries. Foreign 
involvement in these sectors would accrue not only to the outside world's 
benefit; it would also accelerate the modernization of sectors crucial to 
China's entire development. 
</P>
<P>
 * The United States and China should accelerate the negotiations over China's 
entry into the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade under terms that commit 
China to a firm, phased-in program to achieve full GATT standards. This is the 
path taken for Mexico's entry into GATT. It is in everyone's interest -- 
including China's -- that it follow the same, rigorous procedures. 
</P>
<P>
 * The United States should vigorously expand cooperation with China in the 
areas of scholarly exchange, environmental issues, protection of endangered 
species, narcotics control, public health and population migration. Problems of 
the 21st Century will not be solved without China's active participation. 
</P>
<P>
 * The President must persist in the human-rights area. But a confrontational 
approach will not work. Rather, the Administration must approach China with 
respect for its intellectual traditions and accomplishments. While continuing 
to press for release of specific individuals, the United States -- and 
especially the private sector -- should join hands with those Chinese who wish 
to develop their legal system, strengthen their parliaments, establish a police 
system under the rule of law, foster an independent judiciary and train 
professional journalists. In the long run, development of formal and 
transparent political institutions is the best way to enhance basic human 
rights in China.  
</P>
<P>
 Let there be no illusions. Sino-American relations remain fragile, and future 
political development is uncertain. China's emergence onto the world scene 
involves a protracted and painful process. President Clinton has now set on a 
proper path. But patience, firmness and persistence will be needed if this 
increasingly significant relationship is to achieve its potential.

FIXATIONS / JIM WASHBURN: CAFES' CURATOR BASKS IN HIS ROCKIN' ROLE; JOHN 
ROSENFIELD WILL SPEAK WEDNESDAY IN LAGUNA ABOUT A DREAM JOB -- COLLECTING MUSIC 
MEMORABILIA FOR THE MEGA-POPULAR RESTAURANTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By JIM WASHBURN

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Some kids kept their noses in their textbooks, diligently applied themselves 
to their studies and were rewarded with professions or positions in hi-tech 
industries. Then they lost those jobs in our rocky economy and possibly found 
themselves among the 3,000 applicants seeking food service jobs at the Newport 
Beach Hard Rock Cafe when it opened in October, 1992. John Rosenfield, 
meanwhile, had spent his formative years crowding the walls of his room with 
rock 'n' roll posters, drawing Rat Fink cartoons on his friends' T-shirts with 
a Magic Marker, and pondering the big questions of life, like, "I wonder where 
Jimi Hendrix's Woodstock Strat is now?" 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike his hapless contemporaries, Rosenfield has a swell job, one that allows 
him to jet around the world, hobnob with the rock elite and stick rock 'n' roll 
posters on expensively wood-paneled walls, and it pays him to wonder about the 
whereabouts of the now-legendary guitars of Hendrix and other stars. 
</P>
<P>
 As curator for Hard Rock America, which owns half of the world's growing 
supply of Hard Rock Cafes, it is Rosenfield's job to find and acquire 
rock-related rarities -- from Buddy Holly's thick-framed glasses to Kurt 
Cobain's guitar -- for display in the mega-popular restaurants. It's a job he 
will be speaking about Wednesday night at the Laguna Art Museum, as part of its 
"The Art of Money" lecture series. 
</P>
<P>
 It isn't simply serendipity that landed Rosenfield, 38, his position. Between 
times spent staring longingly at the guitars on Eric Clapton album covers, he's 
also studied art and design, dealt in antiques, and done time in management, 
helming some of Ralph Lauren's shops. That experience all comes in handy, but 
one suspects he's where he is -- working in blue jeans, driving a '56 ragtop 
T-Bird, and inhabiting an office so cool that you hear John Lee Hooker music 
when he puts your call on hold -- because he clearly has followed Big Joe 
Campbell's famed maxim and followed his bliss. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love rock 'n' roll music. It's my life," Rosenfield said. "When I was a 
kid, I always went overboard with posters on the wall and everything. I had 
collected lots of signed photos and had a huge record collection, thousands of 
records, which I lost this year in the fire in Malibu.  
</P>
<P>
 "And vintage guitars are a real passion for me. Like vintage cars, there's an 
authenticity to them that's so real . I could have a guitar, like a 1954 Les 
Paul, and never touch it, just look at it and go, 'God, what a piece of art.' " 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 We spoke in the Beverly Center Hard Rock Cafe, the one that's set apart from 
its upscale neighbors by the be-finned Cadillac jutting out of its roof. The 
interior is scarcely any less flashy, with such prizes as a 1958 Harley Elektra 
Glide once owned by Elvis Presley, a gaudy gold metal-flake guitar of Chris 
Isaak's, the accessory-loaded moped from the Who's "Quadrophenia," and a bass 
dismembered by the same band. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosenfield got his start with the Hard Rock managing this location when it 
opened in 1982. Previously, while managing the Beverly Hills Ralph Lauren store 
he had met and become friends with Hard Rock founder and owner Peter Morton. 
Visiting Morton once in the late '70s at the original 1971-opened London Hard 
Rock, Rosenfield suggested to him that he should build a L.A. location and that 
he would like to work for him if he did. 
</P>
<P>
 So Morton did, and Rosenfield did, though he soon found that being a 
restaurant manager didn't provide much creative satisfaction once the place was 
set up and running.  
</P>
<P>
 "I liked working for Peter, but I didn't like the job that much. What I really 
wanted to do was collect the stuff full time. But back then this was the only 
Hard Rock (in the United States) and no one knew how it was going to take off." 
</P>
<P>
 Rosenfield wound up going back to work for Lauren until six years ago, when 
the Hard Rocks had become such an expanding proposition that they needed a 
full-time curator. With him making the acquisitions, the chain now has the 
world's largest collection of rock items, leading People magazine to refer to 
it as "the Smithsonian of rock 'n' roll." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In the Newport Hard Rock you'll see Prince's "Purple Rain" outfit and guitars 
that were formerly the possessions of stars ranging from the Cure to local surf 
guitar legend Dick Dale. There's more local color in displays of the skate and 
surf boards of local celebs, and even the motorcycle gas tank from fashion 
kingpin Mossimo Giannulli. 
</P>
<P>
 At the entrance there's a Beatles display that includes one of Paul 
McCartney's violin-shaped Hofner basses, and that isn't just any Coke sign 
hanging there, but the one that once adorned the Beatles' first haunt, 
Liverpool's Casbah Club. Rosenfield works closely on such displays with Hard 
Rock creative director Warwick Stone, who is the fellow responsible for the 
Cadillac woody that hovers over the Newport location's bar. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not easy finding such treasures -- Rosenfield routinely works 10-hour 
days -- and his success at it just makes the job harder. In amassing its trove, 
Rosenfield maintains that the Hard Rock Cafe practically created the present 
market for rock memorabilia and certainly upped the ante for rare items.  
</P>
<P>
 When the London Hard Rock opened, rockers had been glad to donate their relics 
to hang on the walls. Now, the value of their castoffs is so great that those 
in possession of them understandably want heaps of money. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosenfield wouldn't disclose the budget he has to work with, saying only, 
"It's big ." But it evidently has limits. When the Fullerton-made Stratocaster 
guitar played by Hendrix at Woodstock (the same instrument Rosenfield mused 
about as was a kid, original list price $330) came up for auction a while back, 
he had to pass on it, as an Italian collector had made a record-breaking bid of 
$325,000 for the guitar. 
</P>
<P>
 He did turn up Hendrix-played Flying V and acoustic guitars, though, as well 
as one of his fringed buckskin jackets. The L.A. Hard Rock also host's Elvis' 
most photographed guitar, a black Gibson adorned with a karate sticker that 
Elvis used through his Vegas years. Rosenfield bought it at a Sotheby's auction 
for $25,000 and says it has quadrupled in value during the last four years.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 There are some rock icons that have eluded him so far. He'd love to acquire 
the prime guitars of Duane Allman and Eddie Cochran, as well as the 
psychedelic-painted Gibson SG that Clapton played in his Cream days. (Cream 
drummer Ginger Baker's personalized bass drum heads already reside in the Las 
Vegas Hard Rock.) 
</P>
<P>
 Rosenfield has his own favorites of the things he's turned up. A big Roxy 
Music fan, he spent some time tracking down the leopard jacket Bryan Ferry wore 
on an early album cover.  
</P>
<P>
 "And I was really knocked out to get Buddy Holly's custom cowboy boots that he 
handmade himself. Leather tooling was his side interest. They have his initials 
on the outside, and on the inside are his girlfriend of the time's initials -- 
her name was Echo McGuire. They are amazingly beautiful, the most beautiful 
cowboy boots I've ever seen in my life." 
</P>
<P>
 He says he never feels torn between keeping such things for himself or turning 
them over to the Hard Rock. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a lot of things I would have liked for myself, but this is my job. 
I focus on doing it for the Hard Rock. I don't really collect rock 'n' roll 
memorabilia for myself now because I do it for a living," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 His work day usually starts around 8:30 a.m. "It's mostly faxing and phone 
calls, studying auction catalogues, coming up with ideas for framing and 
concepts for different displays we're going to do," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 Due to the Hard Rock's reputation, he often is the first person approached 
with a rare item, so he has to know his stuff. About half his callers are 
established dealers he's dealt with and trusts; others are unknown quantities. 
During a follow-up phone call for this interview, he kept excusing himself to 
deal with a party on another line claiming to have one of Elvis' 1950s 
microphones. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has photos of Elvis using it up close, so it might be a good piece," he 
said. "Sometimes it's hard to authenticate things like that. If some guy says, 
'Bob Dylan threw this shirt off the stage in 1966,' how can we prove that? I 
usually only buy things if there's full documentation on it, or if I know the 
person or if there's photographs of the person wearing the particular item. 
There is some fake memorabilia out there, but I know it petty well." 
</P>
<P>
 He often works into the night, hanging out backstage at concerts to talk to 
acts about donating items for exhibit (Often, in return, the Hard Rock will 
make donations to the acts' favored charities). 
</P>
<P>
 His job has grown more complicated in the last couple of years, having to 
determine not only what's rare, but what might someday be rare. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to stay cutting-edge. These kids come in, and a lot of them 
don't know who Jerry Lee Lewis is. They want to see Pearl Jam, Soundgarden and 
Nirvana. So that's where my head is now. I don't want this to be a mausoleum," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Universal City Hard Rock Cafe, due to open in a year, will be "very '90s, 
real thrash, grunge, skating, Generation X, Pearl Jam, Gin Blossoms, Primal 
Scream style stuff, as new as you can get." 
</P>
<P>
 He tries to stay on top of trends, to determine which artists are going to 
last for a while. "A lot of bands who want to give us stuff are just one-hit 
wonders. I already have storerooms full of stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to stocking the 13 Hard Rock America-owned cafes -- which are as 
far-flung as Australia and Israel -- Rosenfield has been working overtime on 
the Hard Rock hotel and casino due to open in Vegas in December. There even the 
rooms, such as a proposed Elvis suite, will sport memorabilia.  
</P>
<P>
 "The hotel is going to be full-on the most amazing collection of rock and roll 
ever assembled," he claims. "It's not going to be lots of little things. We 
don't want to repeat ourselves, and we already have the Hard Rock Cafe there 
now. 
</P>
<P>
 "In order not to repeat ourselves, we're going to have only major pieces. Each 
guitar there -- like a Springsteen Telecaster or the guitar Bill Haley used to 
record 'Rock Around the Clock' -- will have enough substance to stand on its 
own. There are going to be a lot of surprises, a lot of really interesting 
things." 
</P>
<P>
 As much as he enjoys the hunt and hustle of finding rock rarities, his real 
satisfaction comes after they're in place. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whenever I'm in a city with a Hard Rock, I go in and watch people's reactions 
to things. Most people really are into it. They walk around and really study 
the stuff, get excited when they see certain pieces. Then there are others who 
will walk right by a really amazing piece and not even look at it. I wonder 
about people like that, but that's OK too. 
</P>
<P>
 "To me, doing this is like making a movie, from the ground up. You go to a 
place and there's nothing there. And you have to come up with ideas for it and 
put it together, and the excitement builds, and when it finally opens, it's 
like going to your movie's premiere. That's very fulfilling."

DOWNTIME: BODY WATCH; A MARTINI MOMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Martinis. Comes a rare Friday we're not expected to attend anything, arrive 
anywhere.Work's over. No one's waiting for their dinner. Kids aren't around. 
Husband feels as I do. Stirred, not shaken really does make a difference. 
Poured elegantly, on the stem. Wine is fine for social occasions, but I can 
risk a martini or two when no one's expecting another thing from me. I revel in 
it.

RSVP; THEY CAME; THEY SAW; THEY BOUGHT; BENEFIT: IT WAS SERIOUS BUSINESS FOR 
ENTHUSIASTS AT THE TEMPORARY CONTEMPORARY'S AUCTION. BUT THEN, WHEN ART IS 
LETHAL AND LEONARD NIMOY SHELLS OUT $15,000, WHAT ELSE COULD IT BE?

 The best kind of art enthusiasts came, some 700 strong, to the Museum of 
Contemporary Art's sixth biennial art auction Friday night. You know what kind 
that is. They meant business. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, I work for a collector I could safely say is considered big by major 
auction houses, and we have every intention of trying to secure something 
tonight," said Michele DeAngelus, curator of the Broad Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 And could she say what she might be trying to secure? 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, no, one never does that before bidding," she replied. 
</P>
<P>
 Never mind the Patina-catered dinner. Throughout much of the silent auction, 
Rhona Edelbaum, director of the Ruth Bloom Gallery, was poised, ear to cellular 
phone, before a porcelain plate depicting a gigantic puppy by Jeff Koons. Her 
boyfriend, who was at home, wanted it, and she needed to know how much he was 
willing to spend before a rival dealer got it. (The boyfriend beat out the 
dealer.) 
</P>
<P>
 "I wouldn't miss this for anything in the world," said another bidder, rushing 
through the Temporary Contemporary (not scheduled to formally reopen until next 
year) to get another look at the piece she wound up taking home, a Seth Kaufman 
collage of photographic equipment salvaged from buildings destroyed in the 1992 
riots. "I've been to auctions that are better than Broadway shows," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if some of the prices fetched were a disappointment -- a few pieces went 
for far below their printed, estimated value -- 90% of the works sold, bringing 
in more than $500,000 for the museum. "That's a nice little kick in the 
treasury," said John Marion, chairman of Sotheby's, who conducted the live 
auction. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, nearly everyone, amateur and professional, had an opinion of the 
art-market temperature based on the evening's take. "Flat," concluded one 
dealer. "Do you think the estimates have anything to do with reality? They're 
dream figures, and if you get anywhere close you have a successful auction," 
said collector Richard Rosenzweig, ticking off some of the evening's highest 
prices.  
</P>
<P>
 "There are different ways to interpret what happens in an auction and this one 
is no different," allowed Richard Koshalek, MOCA's director. "It's still a 
difficult market, and it hasn't begun an upward swing, but because just about 
everything sold, it shows there is still strong interest in acquiring works by 
leading contemporary artists." 
</P>
<P>
 It was Leonard Nimoy and his wife, Susan Bay, who provided one of the 
evening's most dramatic moments during the live auction. With paddles flying, 
they made the winning bid of $15,000, nearly double the high estimate, for a 
Joel Shapiro chalk and pastel on paper. "Well, we wanted the piece," Nimoy said 
coolly. "We could sense there were other people interested, and we were 
determined to stick it out." 
</P>
<P>
 Noting the evening's key players, the invitation looked a little like a 
letterhead for a major law firm. Unlike other charity affairs where party 
organization is a key component, this one also required an "auction executive 
chairman" -- Bob Gersh -- and "executive chairman emeritus" -- Doug Cramer. 
</P>
<P>
 When someone nearly tripped over one of the pieces for sale, a pair of "shoes" 
carved from large hunks of tree by Liz Young, Cramer, ever the art lover, 
suggested cheerily: "They're dangerous. That's the good thing about the best of 
art -- there's always that lethal quality."

 As actress Jennifer O'Neill put it, you didn't have to know one end of a horse 
from another to enjoy this weekend's Oaks Classic horse show at the San Juan 
Capistrano ranch of Joan Irvine Smith. 
</P>
<P>
 For the more than 500 guests who attended the Grand Prix luncheon Sunday, the 
final day of the equestrian competition, it was enough just to be among the 
gleaming horses and old oaks at the picturesque ranch, savoring omelets with 
caviar and crab-stuffed tacos while watching the show. The Oaks Classic, 
including the $150-per-person luncheon, raised about $100,000 for the National 
Water Research Institute in Fountain Valley. Riding High 
</P>
<P>
 While riders coaxed their horses over obstacles in the $50,000 Oaks Classic 
Grand Prix, guests milled about inside a huge white tent set up along the 
course. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is one of the most anticipated shows. It's done with grace and glamour," 
said Robert Drennan, a show manager for many grand national horse shows. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not every show has these amenities. Where else can you find grass on top of 
grass?" he added, looking down at the artificial turf that covered the lawn 
inside the tent. 
</P>
<P>
 The tent was filled with tables covered in brightly colored cloths and food 
stations where guests could load up on all kinds of fare: made-to-order 
omelets, tacos one could fill with chicken, beef or crab meat and sundaes with 
a smorgasbord of toppings. 
</P>
<P>
 Some spectators looked like chic cowboys in elegant boots, hats and Western 
shirts that were better suited for parties than riding the ranch. Mary 
Moore-Young sported a brown suede skirt, straw hat and vest adorned with gold 
braid designed for her by the late Michael Nusskern, a fashion designer from 
Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm mesmerized by this event," Moore-Young said. "It's lovely -- the 
openness, the beauty, the way it's all set up." Horsey Set 
</P>
<P>
 Joan Irvine Smith wore an Hermes-print blouse with her khakis. Every year 
Hermes has a booth at the show where guests can pick up a silk scarf with an 
equestrian print for $225. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a natural Hermes should be included in a great horse show," said 
Francine Bardot, managing director of Hermes Beverly Hills. The fashion house 
started in Paris 156 years ago as a saddle and harness maker. 
</P>
<P>
 Many spectators were serious about horses. O'Neill is a longtime horse lover 
who had two horses entered in the competition and owns 28 horses at her ranch 
in Malibu. 
</P>
<P>
 "My parents always said it was a phase I would grow out of," said the 
46-year-old actress. "But I'm forever in love with horses." 
</P>
<P>
 The recipient of the proceeds, the National Water Research Institute, was 
founded three years ago with the help of the Joan Irvine Smith & Athalie R. 
Clarke Foundation to identify and support research that will lead to improved 
water quality and supply. 
</P>
<P>
 "Joan has an honest interest in water. She comes from a family of agrarians, 
and she appreciates what water means to people," said Ronald Linsky, executive 
director of the institute. 
</P>
<P>
 Other guests were: Morton (Cappy) Smith, Gilbert Agguire, Evelyn Baird, Marsha 
Grindberg, David and Anita Hansen, Beverly Hay, Howard House, Robert Jolicouer, 
Marie Mainz, Willy Nalls, Elrick Pinckney, Bruce Rittmann, Ronda Sandquist, 
James Swinden and Roger and Louise Williams. KATHRYN BOLD

BOOK REVIEW / FICTION; 6 WOMEN, 180 YEARS AND ONE DULL STORY; THE GIRLS BY 
ELAINE KAGAN ; ALFRED A. KNOPF; $23, 307 PAGES

 Unless you're a speed reader, "The Girls" is a weekend in a locked room with 
six middle-aged women from Kansas City reliving their golden high school years 
and the three decades that followed.  
</P>
<P>
 Altogether, that makes a grand total of 180 years of memories, mostly of Pete 
Chickery, the super-neat guy with whom they were all in love, simultaneously, 
separately and continually. When you add Pete's recollections, you've got 210 
years, but it seems like a millennium. 
</P>
<P>
 The story begins with a literal bang -- Pete's wife, Jessie, shoots him for 
serial adultery -- and goes backward and downward from there. The "girls" have 
reassembled in K.C. for Pete's funeral, an event they anticipate with intense 
emotions. 
</P>
<P>
 Early in the novel, the ditziest of the six narrators describes the bathing 
suits they had in the glorious summer of 1960, the last time all of them were 
truly happy. Frances' suit was lime green with skinny straps and a ruffled 
skirt, Ellen's was a white Jantzen, and Jessie's was black -- no doubt 
symbolizing a future in which she'd kill her husband. 
</P>
<P>
 If only the girls had kept those suits, it would be easier to tell them apart 
now. At least three of them would be color-coded. As it is, they're virtually 
indistinguishable as they reminisce about the past and muse about the present. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the names identifying their individual sections, they meld into one 
flat Midwestern voice reciting banalities. There are no signposts whatever -- 
no news of the world, no mention of books, movies, or even TV shows that might 
help the reader place the events in time and space. The description of Kansas 
City is so sketchy that the novel could just as easily be taking place in 
Vladivostok, or anywhere at all where the summers are humid, the winters are 
cold, and there's a chance of tornadoes -- although the tornado never happens. 
You're almost sorry, because it could have been a dramatic event, and a 
300-page book needs more than one of those. The funeral can't do it all. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's Ellen, in 1994, almost 50: "I never wanted to do anything. I just 
wanted to stay right here and marry Tom and have his babies and get a house on 
the Kansas side and fix it up real cute and go to the club and play cards and 
read recipe books and make interesting things, you know." And her dream came 
true. Did it ever. 
</P>
<P>
 Frances left K.C. and went to New York, where she became an actress, playing a 
few bits in television serials. She married George, from whom she's divorced. 
George drives a Mercedes, but that's virtually all we ever learn about him. 
</P>
<P>
 Anne went to school in Texas. She married Joe but couldn't have children, and 
after they split up, she moved to California, where she has an unidentified job 
with IBM. I would have liked to know more about that, if only because it's the 
only job mentioned -- if you don't count Billy, who's a fireman married to Tee, 
or Pete himself, a traveling salesman in down-market blouses. 
</P>
<P>
 Tee has two characteristics that set her apart from the rest. She's profane 
and she suffered from acute postpartum depression. 
</P>
<P>
 Anita is Pete Chickery's sister, a prude who tries to make up for the fact 
that her brother is a lecher. She was in love with Neil in high school but she 
married Leonard. All we know about Leonard is that he noticed immediately how 
much Anita disliked her brother. That's probably enough. Husbands get a minimum 
of attention here. 
</P>
<P>
 Jessie is the shooter. In high school, she was the one the others envied. Her 
parents opposed her marriage to Pete, and she should have listened. 
</P>
<P>
 With the exception of Anita and one other, all the "girls" slept with Pete at 
one time or another. As they natter on, it becomes ever more obvious that 
sleeping with Pete was the pivotal event in their lives. They all feel guilty 
about it, because of course he was either already married to Jessie or about to 
be. 
</P>
<P>
 Was Pete an utter rat? No, because sleeping with him was not only fun, but 
incredibly therapeutic; a cure for depression, low self-esteem, suicidal 
tendencies, even cancer. The qualities that made Pete so irresistible were his 
blue eyes and his Southern accent, although you wouldn't think that either 
would be so rare in Missouri. 
</P>
<P>
 He seems to have committed most of his adulteries for altruistic reasons, 
although of course Jessie doesn't know that. Perhaps if she did, she wouldn't 
have shot him, but you never know.

 Danny Buxbaum's two-run double in the seventh inning helped Miami overcome six 
errors as the top-seeded Hurricanes stayed alive Monday in the College World 
Series with a 7-5 victory over Auburn. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's probably about as ugly a win as we've ever had," said a relieved 
Hurricanes Coach Jim Morris. 
</P>
<P>
 Miami (49-13) advanced to today's elimination game against the loser of Monday 
night's game between Oklahoma and Arizona State. 
</P>
<P>
 Auburn (44-21) was ousted, losing both games in its first CWS appearance since 
1976. 
</P>
<P>
 Miami took advantage of an error for four unearned runs in the first. The 
Hurricanes scored three times in the seventh.

THE DAY IT WAS ALMOST OVER FOR YOGI BERRA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Steve Jacobson, Newsday 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On the morning of June 6, 1944, the waiting was over for Yogi Berra; it was 
time to go. He'd waited on June 4 and all through the night of June 5. It was 
his D-Day, too. 
</P>
<P>
 He was then Lawrence Berra, 19 years old, Seaman 1st Class, U.S. Navy, and he 
was tossing and turning and waiting in the chop of the English Channel off the 
Normandy coast. Off Omaha Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 He'd set out on the Coast Guard transport Bayfield from Plymouth, England, 
early June 4 with history's largest amphibious landing and waited for the 
weather to settle. For nearly three weeks he'd essentially been confined to 
base. "We didn't know when we were going to go out," Berra recalled later. 
"They didn't tell us anything." 
</P>
<P>
 So many of the men who endured that day and survived look back on it as the 
most significant moment of their lives. Berra nodded his agreement. "I'd have 
to say I was involved," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 I was browsing a book of World War II history during the time Berra was 
managing for George Steinbrenner. I came across this mention of Berra on the 
Bayfield. Steinbrenner's bluster did not frighten him. "Being there at Omaha 
may have changed my life a little," Berra said. 
</P>
<P>
 There was some question of how frightened he was even then. Berra was on the 
Bayfield, the Coast Guard flagship, waiting to go over the side into a 36-foot 
LCSS, formally known as a landing craft support small. "We called it landing 
craft suicide squad," Berra recalled. It was a wooden-hulled craft with steel 
plating topside. Six sailors and an officer would clamber aboard and the 
Bayfield's cranes would lower them into the Channel. There were eight LCSS on 
the big boat, each of them named PA 33 for the Bayfield. 
</P>
<P>
 "We went out to rendezvous for the landing on the 5th and we had to zig-zag 
out there until the next morning," Berra said. "Then we went in with the first 
wave." 
</P>
<P>
 He had just turned 19 and had been permitted to finish his minor-league season 
at Norfolk in 1943 before being called to active duty. As rough as the Channel 
was, Berra recalled that he hadn't been seasick. "Was seasick one time," he 
said. That was going from Bayonne to Boston and it was smooth as glass, but 
Berra, the kid from St. Louis, had never been on the water before. 
</P>
<P>
 Berra's job was manning a battery of twin 50-caliber machine guns and loading 
for a rocket launcher. They were supposed to sit 300 yards off the beach to 
lend fire support for the landing and anti-aircraft fire, and to pick up downed 
fliers. But first the big ships bombarded the beach, shells flashing over the 
heads of Berra and shipmates. "Like the Fourth of July," Berra said. "It was 
loud." 
</P>
<P>
 He recalled that there wasn't much for him to do that day. Instead of keeping 
below the armor plating with shot and shell whizzing all around, Berra -- being 
Berra -- watched. "The officer told me, 'Better get your damn head down,' " 
Berra said. "I wanted to watch. I wasn't scared; I don't know why. For some 
reason I wasn't. It was amazing to see all those ships there." 
</P>
<P>
 He recalled that his craft drew very little fire from the Germans on the beach 
or from the air. In supporting the landing, they were also to bring in downed 
German fliers for interrogation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Only guy we fished out, the only plane that came down in our sector, we shot 
down," Berra said. "It was one of our guys." 
</P>
<P>
 But the officer directing fire said: "That's a German," and Berra's guncrew 
fired. "You did what you were ordered," he said. "When we got there to him in 
the water, he was cursing like hell. I would have been angry, too. We fished 
him out and he's yelling: 'If you shot down as many of theirs as you shoot down 
of ours, the war would have been over long ago.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Berra spent two weeks off the beach on the LCSS shuttling messages between 
Omaha and Utah beaches and looking for magnetic mines the Germans may have 
dropped overnight. 
</P>
<P>
 Then they were lifted out of the sea and packed off to Bizerte in North Africa 
to prepare for another landing. That was in southern France in what came to be 
called the Champagne Campaign. "It was at some resort," Berra said. "We stayed 
one day; it was an easy landing." 
</P>
<P>
 It was there, Berra said, that he fired his machine guns at the enemy. "There 
was a machine-gun nest in a hotel," he said. "We knocked it down. We could see 
two guys running out. We must have got something because it stopped firing."

YIELDS FALL ON MOOD OF FED; DOW LOSES 3.70 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bond prices increased and yields dropped for the fourth consecutive trading 
day Monday, as traders and investors gained confidence that interest rates will 
remain stable in coming weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Market players said they were encouraged by the comments of three Federal 
Reserve Board governors quoted in Monday's New York Times. The Fed officials 
said recent economic figures, including Friday's unemployment report, indicate 
a slowing expansion and a diminishing risk of inflation, reducing the 
likelihood of a further rise in interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 The yield on the main 30-year bond fell to 7.22% from 7.26% on Friday. Its 
price, which moves in the opposite direction, rose 15/32 point, or $4.69 per 
$1,000 in face value. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday's rally was fueled by the Times report, which suggested greater comfort 
at the Fed with the country's economic performance. 
</P>
<P>
 The outlook for steady interest rates gave a particular boost to shorter-term 
Treasury securities, because the Fed concentrates on short-term rates in 
setting monetary policy. 
</P>
<P>
 Higher rates on new securities would tend to depress the value of already-sold 
Treasurys, which pay a fixed rate of interest. 
</P>
<P>
 Bonds were also bolstered as plunging corn and soybean led a sharp drop in the 
Commodity Research Bureau index, which helped support the notion that inflation 
remained under control. The CRB index fell 3.21 to 228.84. 
</P>
<P>
 Weekend rains in the Midwest triggered selling of corn and soybeans, and that 
influenced other other commodities prices. 
</P>
<P>
 Stocks closed mixed on Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
 A sharp upward move in share prices mostly evaporated late in the session as 
investors sold stocks that had been run up in value. Smaller capitalization 
stocks fared better than larger issues amid the computer-program-driven 
selling. 
</P>
<P>

EDMONDS IN SPOTLIGHT, BUT ANGELS IN DARK, 8-2 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB NIGHTENGALE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jim Edmonds spent most of spring training wondering if he would be traded -- 
and if it meant avoiding a return to the minors, he actually welcomed the idea. 
</P>
<P>
 He was considered nothing more than an insurance policy, anyway. The Angels 
had already signed veterans Bo Jackson and Dwight Smith to play left field, and 
if Edmonds were needed, it would be as a defensive specialist. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, when the Angels sorely need someone to divert attention from their dismal 
play, Edmonds has stepped into the spotlight. 
</P>
<P>
 While the Angels were losing once again Monday night, this time to the 
Minnesota Twins, 8-2, for their seventh defeat in the last eight games, Edmonds 
provided the only bright spot for most of the 20,405 fans at Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 He couldn't do anything to bail out Angel starter Phil Leftwich, who gave up 
six hits and six earned runs in two innings, but he did hit his third home run 
in four games, in the eighth inning. Since becoming the regular left fielder, 
Edmonds is batting .412 with three homers and six runs batted in. 
</P>
<P>
 Although it will take several weeks for Edmonds to get enough plate 
appearances to qualify among the American League leaders -- his average is now 
.350 -- he suddenly has emerged as a legitimate rookie-of-the-year candidate. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sure, I think about it, why not?" Edmonds said. "It's such a prestigious 
honor. I don't know how much it will hurt me since I wasn't an everyday player 
from the start, but man, it would be nice to have back-to-back rookies of the 
year like the Dodgers." 
</P>
<P>
 While the Angel front office remains numbed by the team's failures on the 
field, no one has been as pleasant a surprise as Edmonds. The Angels (24-33) 
figured that if everything went right, Edmonds would be contending for a 
starting job in 1995. Instead, his play has put Smith on the trading block and 
Jackson on the bench. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not like I hit .240 in the minors," said Edmonds, who batted .315 last 
season at triple-A Vancouver. "Maybe they thought the pressure of playing in 
the big leagues would get me. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was never really considered a prospect, but I always told myself, 'One of 
these days, I'm going to make them believe in me.' 
</P>
<P>
 "It took some time, but I think now they believe in my ability." 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels might have to start relying on Edmonds' bat to jump-start their 
offense, which has scored three or fewer runs in six of their last seven games. 
Their only other run in this game came when last season's rookie of the year, 
Tim Salmon, hit his 12th homer of the season and first in 41 at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels' main asset, however, is that they're in the American League West, 
where everyone can be a contender. The Angels, who have the fifth-worst record 
in baseball, are only 3 1/2 games behind the Texas Rangers in a division that 
hasn't had a .500 team since April 19. 
</P>
<P>
 They never even had a chance in this one. While Twin starter Kevin Tapani 
(7-2) was yielding one run in seven innings, Leftwich couldn't get out of the 
third. He gave up two runs in the first and, after a 1-2-3 second, was hammered 
for four consecutive hits in the third, including a two-run homer by Kirby 
Puckett. It was the shortest outing of Leftwich's major league career. 
</P>
<P>
 Leftwich (3-5), who was 3-0 with a 2.41 earned-run average in his last six 
starts, said he never felt right. He complained of soreness in his lower right 
leg, which was diagnosed later as anterior compartment syndrome. He is 
scheduled to undergo a magnetic resonance imaging test today. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, he was in pain," Angel catcher Jorge Fabregas said. "He didn't 
have his sharp command that he usually has. I'm sure his leg was affecting his 
command." Leftwich, though, said he certainly has more to worry about than his 
leg. 
</P>
<P>
 His wife, Ann, is due with their first baby any day. If the baby doesn't 
arrive by Wednesday night, the birth will be induced Thursday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 "Believe me," Leftwich said, "that's my biggest concern."

 "He doesn't care about the game of football or football players," Johnson 
said. "He loves money. . . . Al Davis loves to talk football for hours, to

be like Al."

THE NHL / HELENE ELLIOTT; REFEREES MIGHT PAY FOR WRONG CALLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HELENE ELLIOTT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Players are fined for missing meetings or the team bus. Why shouldn't game 
officials be fined for missing calls? 
</P>
<P>
 NHL Senior Vice President Brian Burke said the league, which did not use its 
right to fine referees this season, might invoke that power next season. 
</P>
<P>
 "With the wages we pay those guys, we have the right to expect performance and 
to fine them if they fall below that performance level," he said. "It's common 
in the NBA if an official blows a call. They just don't publicize it." 
</P>
<P>
 The officials' next training camp will be lengthened to 10 days and will 
include viewing tapes of calls Burke thinks were incorrect. Among them will be 
Pavel Bure's elbowing of Shane Churla in the quarterfinals, which drew only a 
minor penalty from referee Andy vanHellemond. Burke said Bure should have been 
ejected. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a cheap shot," Burke said. 
</P>
<P>
 Burke, who is completing his first season as the NHL's disciplinarian, said 
he's satisfied players have gotten the message that he wants the game to be 
rugged but not vicious. About two-thirds of the 40 suspensions he imposed were 
handed out in the first half of the season, which he took as a sign players 
learned the limits of his patience. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a crackdown on tough hockey," he said. "I was GM of Hartford for one 
year and we were the second-most penalized team in the league. In Vancouver, we 
had the biggest team in the league. What I'm bouncing guys for is stupid stuff, 
gouging eyes, running other guys. Circus stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 Burke, a former player, has shown good judgment in his rulings. Even so, he 
might be too lenient toward superstars such as Mario Lemieux, who charged out 
of the penalty box to argue with referee Kerry Fraser. Lemieux should have been 
suspended. Overall, Burke has given the office credibility. BAGELS WITH BETTMAN 
</P>
<P>
 Commissioner Gary Bettman, flattered by Ted Turner's reported interest in 
bringing the NHL back to Atlanta, said expansion is not in his plans. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have not promised them (a franchise) and I wouldn't," he said during a 
breakfast meeting Sunday. "We've got to get the collective bargaining agreement 
done and make sure we have 26 healthy franchises, preferably in the places they 
are now." 
</P>
<P>
 Bettman also said the NHL and its players' association are far from reaching a 
new agreement. The owners' push for salary controls is the major difference. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it doesn't happen, we're going to have some really hurting franchises in a 
hurry," said Bill Torrey, president of the Florida Panthers. "Among those of us 
that are involved in this business, everyone has reached a point where some 
sanity has to prevail." BYE-BYE, BRYAN 
</P>
<P>
 Someone had to pay for the Detroit Red Wings' first-round loss to San Jose. It 
wasn't going to be Coach Scotty Bowman, who has a year left at about $1 
million, so it had to be General Manager Bryan Murray. 
</P>
<P>
 Murray told friends he believes Bowman and Senior Vice President Jimmy 
Devellano pushed him out. Possibly, but his poor judgment was the real problem. 
As late as last Wednesday, Murray said he didn't believe the Red Wings' 
goaltending was so bad and that their defense was adequate. Wrong and wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 Murray's failure to acquire a top-notch goalie was his downfall. He claimed he 
couldn't get Grant Fuhr or Bill Ranford without giving up Chris Osgood and at 
least one more prospect, but other general managers scoffed and said that only 
Murray's indecisiveness prevented a deal. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Bowman said he doesn't want the general manager's job, he might take 
it. Either way, look for Steve Yzerman to be traded, perhaps for a goalie. 
WHALE OF A SALE 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Holmgren's future as general manager of the Whalers is uncertain in the 
wake of the team's sale to Compuware executives Peter Karamanos and Thomas 
Thewes. The new owners appointed Jim Rutherford, a former NHL goalie who runs 
Compuware's youth hockey programs, the Whalers' chief operating officer and 
president. They said nothing about the GM duties, and it's likely Rutherford 
will take those on. 
</P>
<P>
 Rutherford's first move is probably going to be hiring Mike Milbury to coach. 
Milbury's surprise departure from the Boston Bruins was followed by an even 
more surprising resignation from Boston College before coaching a game. DIVIDED 
LOYALTIES 
</P>
<P>
 Clint Smith, a forward on the Rangers' last Stanley Cup-winning team in 1940, 
has been a guest of the Rangers and Canucks during the finals. Smith, 80, isn't 
sure which team to cheer for because he has lived in Vancouver most of his 
life. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've got to be a Vancouver man, but my heart's still in New York," said 
Smith, who played 11 seasons and retired in 1947. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith follows the Canucks closely and attends most home games. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pavel Bure, he's a real crowd pleaser," Smith said. "He's one of those guys 
who comes along once a generation."  
</P>
<P>
 Smith, however, doesn't think much of how hockey has evolved. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a better game, but it's still a good game," he said. "The finesse 
and stick handling have gone out. They shoot the puck in and run after it 
more." SLAP SHOTS 
</P>
<P>
 Brett Hull denied a St. Louis radio station's report that he had demanded the 
Blues trade him to the Bruins or Kings. . . . Toronto Coach Pat Burns is about 
to get a contract extension and raise. He wants the same salary as Montreal's 
Jacques Demers, about $800,000. 
</P>
<P>
 No matter who wins the Stanley Cup, a Russian-trained player will get his name 
on it for the first time. That honor could go to Bure or to Sergei Nemchinov, 
Sergei Zubov, Alexander Karpovtsev and Alexei Kovalev of the Rangers. The first 
Russian-born player to win the Cup was Chicago's Johnny Gottselig in 1934.

 "We talked as a team about getting started now for next year," Brown said.

forward. So I think we're all committed to doing that."

ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALLAN MALAMUD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 That sigh of relief you heard Sunday came from NBC headquarters in New York. . 
. . 
</P>
<P>
 NBA playoff ratings are down and a Houston Rocket-Indiana Pacer series would 
have been a ratings disaster. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the network gets the team everyone outside New York and sister city 
L.A. loves to hate, the Knicks, against the Rockets in the finals that begin 
Wednesday in Houston. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 That means a quality matchup at center, Hakeem Olajuwon vs. Patrick Ewing. . . 
. 
</P>
<P>
 The last time they met for a national championship was on April 2, 1984. . . . 
 
</P>
<P>
 It was Ewing's Georgetown Hoyas vs. Olajuwon's Houston Cougars for the NCAA 
title at the Kingdome in Seattle. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 According to former Times writer Mike Littwin's story, the widely advertised 
duel turned into "a minor skirmish." Ewing had 10 points, nine rebounds and 
four blocked shots. Olajuwon had 15 points, nine rebounds and one block. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Georgetown got 19 points in 26 minutes from a freshman named Reggie Williams 
and won, 84-75. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Ten years later, look for Olajuwon to reverse the decision. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 He has become the premier player in basketball, far more consistent than 
Ewing, and his supporting cast is better. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Call it the Rockets over the Knicks in five. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 That report that the Clippers will ask New York for permission to talk to Pat 
Riley about coming back to L.A. makes sense. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Donald Sterling always asks. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 He probably also will ask the Pacers for permission to talk to Larry Brown, 
who, surprisingly enough, isn't crazy about living in Indiana. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 A cinch to be traded in the off-season is Pacer guard Pooh Richardson, the 
former UCLA Bruin who fell out of favor with Brown and didn't even suit up for 
playoff games. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Among those who will play for USC Coach George Raveling on the U.S. team in 
the Goodwill Games next month at St. Petersburg, Russia, are Corliss Williamson 
and Scotty Thurman of Arkansas, Cherokee Parks of Duke and Damon Stoudamire of 
Arizona. A summer school obligation is expected to keep Ed O'Bannon of UCLA 
out. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The team will practice for 10 days at UC Irvine starting July 4. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Only in 1994 is 21-7 as likely to be a baseball score as a football score. . . 
.  
</P>
<P>
 Ron Coomer, the 27-year-old third baseman who is driving in a lot of runs for 
the Dodgers' Albuquerque farm club, owns a hitting academy in his hometown of 
Crest Hill, Ill. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The Stephenson family of Southern California could emulate the Boone family by 
producing three generations of major league baseball players. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 UCLA pitcher Brian Stephenson, who was drafted by the Chicago Cubs in the 
second round last week, is the son of Dodger scout and former Boston, Seattle 
and Dodger pitcher Jerry Stephenson, and grandson of former New York Giant, 
Chicago Cub and White Sox infielder Joe Stephenson. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Paul Wilson's first appearance in the College World Series made it easy to see 
why the New York Mets made the right-handed pitcher the No. 1 pick in the 
draft. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Rumors persist that the St. Louis Blues are willing to make Brett Hull 
available. The Kings might be interested, although Hull's salary is hefty. . . 
.  
</P>
<P>
 If the Canucks' legs looked weak Saturday night, maybe it's because they flew 
back to Vancouver on a charter after Thursday night's game and the Rangers got 
a good night's sleep before leaving Friday morning. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Trainer Al Stankie gave boxing lessons to Lolita Davidovich for her starring 
role in the motion picture "Stranger Things." She is now Kid Davidovich, a well 
tuned fighting machine. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Larry Donald -- who is still scheduled to fight Riddick Bowe July 15 at 
Hollywood Park, pending Bowe's recovery from a back injury -- stopped somebody 
named Juan Antonio Diaz in the sixth round Saturday in Reno. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Sixteen of the 22 members of Brazil's World Cup team go by a single name only. 
. . .  
</P>
<P>
 Thoroughbred racing might finally have a superstar in The Wicked North, who 
overcame all kinds of problems before and during the $300,000 Californian 
Sunday at Hollywood Park to win in track record time of 1:46 3/5 for 1 1/8 
miles. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Chris McCarron, who is 10 victories shy of becoming the 11th rider to win 
6,000 races, has been engaged to ride in a $100,000 race at Arapahoe Park on 
June 19. Hollywood Park officials fear the prospect of No. 6,000 being achieved 
in Aurora, Colo. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 New York is trying to become the first city ever to win the NBA championship 
and the Stanley Cup in the same year.

 Rick Gutierrez's sacrifice fly in the 11th inning gave Oklahoma a 4-3 victory 
over Arizona State on Monday night in the winners' bracket of the College World 
Series. 
</P>
<P>
 The run broke a string of seven scoreless innings by relievers of both teams, 
with each team's ace getting the decision -- Bucky Buckles (4-3) for the 
Sooners and Noah Peery (11-2) for Arizona State. 
</P>
<P>
 Peery walked pinch-hitter Dustin Hansen to lead off the 11th and a sacrifice 
bunt and passed ball got him to third for Gutierrez's fly ball to center.

 The Sun Devils (44-17) will play Miami, a 7-5 winner over Auburn on Monday, in

AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP; GRAND SLAM, 7 RBIS FOR YANKEES' WILLIAMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The box score on Bernie Williams' big game Monday night against the Texas 
Rangers shows his seven runs batted in and two home runs, including a grand 
slam. 
</P>
<P>
 What's left out -- even though it's more important, according to New York 
Yankee Manager Buck Showalter -- was the running catch he made to end a rally 
in the fifth inning and the RBI single he had in the eighth of a 17-7 victory 
at Arlington, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
 "That catch and base hit were the two key plays in the game," Showalter said. 
"Some people lose sight of that. I don't." 
</P>
<P>
 Williams' eruption allowed Jimmy Key (8-1) to win his seventh consecutive game 
and tie Kansas City's David Cone and Ben McDonald of Baltimore for the American 
League lead with eight wins. 
</P>
<P>
 The Yankees jumped ahead 10-0 in the fourth after a two-run homer by Williams 
and a three-run shot by Wade Boggs. 
</P>
<P>
 Key was cruising, too, until he allowed two runs in the fourth. Then Texas 
erupted for four in the fifth, three of them after an error by Boggs at third 
base, to make it 10-6. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told myself they're going to have to have a lot of hits to beat me and they 
almost did," Key said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rangers were threatening to keep the rally going, too, when Rusty Greer 
hit a soft looper into center that Williams charged, stretched and scooped into 
the webbing of his mitt. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can see the ball off the bat really well here. That helped," Williams 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams really put the game out of reach in the ninth when he sent a pitch 
from reliever Darren Oliver sailing over a leaping Greer and into the right 
field seats for his eighth homer. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams entered the game hitting .220, even though he had gone .297 over his 
last 19 games. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really nice to have a good game," said Williams, whose grand slam was 
the second of his career. "I've been trying to stick to my approach to the game 
and it's really paying off." 
</P>
<P>
 The switch-hitting Williams homered from both sides of the plate, going to the 
opposite field both times. 
</P>
<P>
 Detroit 11, Boston 5 -- Tim Belcher, winning for the fourth time in five 
starts after an 0-7 start, gave up three runs and six hits in seven innings at 
Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
 Tiger Manager Sparky Anderson credited Belcher's fastball for the improvement. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a huge difference in his velocity, about six miles an hour," he said. 
"He was throwing 82 or 83, now it is 88 or 89, and that's the fastball they 
told me about. Maybe he can't get loose in cold weather." 
</P>
<P>
 Belcher (4-8) said, "The velocity has helped, but the key is that I am 
throwing strikes. Actually, I prefer cool weather. I don't think I was having 
trouble loosening up, I was just psyched out." 
</P>
<P>
 Tony Phillips, who had the first two-homer game of his career Sunday, hit a 
two-run triple in the fourth inning to give the Tigers a 4-2 lead. Alan 
Trammell homered and drove in three runs for the Tigers. 
</P>
<P>
 Boston lost its fourth in a row and also lost starting second baseman Tim 
Naehring for about a week with a sprained right ankle. Naehring tripped over 
the ridge between the dirt and the outfield grass while going back on a fly 
ball. 
</P>
<P>
 Baltimore 4, Kansas City 2 -- Mike Mussina, 6-1 in 10 starts against the 
Royals, shut out them out after the second inning at Kansas City, where he is 
now 4-0. 
</P>
<P>
 Mussina (8-3) gave up seven hits, struck out three and walked none in 7 1/3 
innings. Lee Smith pitched the ninth for his 22nd save. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Gordon (5-4) gave up five walks as the Royals lost for the first time in 
four games. 
</P>
<P>
 Seattle 5, Cleveland 4 -- Felix Fermin hit a sacrifice fly in the eighth 
inning at Seattle as the Mariners ended the Indians' eight-game winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
 Ken Griffey Jr. hit his 23rd homer, most in the majors, and first in eight 
games. 
</P>
<P>
 Eric Anthony, in a one-for-33 slump, opened the eighth with a double and Mike 
Blowers sacrificed. 
</P>
<P>
 Fermin, traded with Reggie Jefferson from Cleveland to Seattle in the 
offseason for Omar Vizquel, drove in a run with a line drive to center. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Risley (4-2) got the victory by pitching a 1-2-3 eighth and Bobby Ayala 
earned his seventh save by pitching the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
 Milwaukee 9, Oakland 6 -- Jose Valentin drove in a career-high four runs and 
Cal Eldred pitched seven strong innings to lead the Brewers at Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
 Valentin hit a two-run homer and a two-run single, and Eldred (6-6) won his 
third consecutive decision. He allowed five runs, three earned, and four hits. 
Mike Fetters pitched the ninth for his sixth save. 
</P>
<P>
 Eldred (6-6) won his third consecutive decision, allowing five runs, three 
earned, and four hits. Mike Fetters pitched the ninth for his sixth save.

BASEBALL DAILY REPORT; DODGERS; OFFERMAN BLAMES HIS FRUSTRATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARYANN HUDSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 He has had little to say over three seasons, instead wanting to be left alone 
to do his job. But in the late afternoon on Monday, Jose Offerman sat at his 
locker in the visiting clubhouse and appeared to be comfortable talking about 
the criticism he has received since becoming the Dodgers' starting shortstop at 
the end of the 1991 season.  
</P>
<P>
 Of the latest incident, when he threw a tantrum in the dugout Wednesday night 
after being asked to bunt with pitcher Ramon Martinez on deck, he said: "I got 
mad for the wrong reason. I went too high." 
</P>
<P>
 Offerman said he would not have made a scene had he not been struggling at the 
plate all season. He has hovered around .200, and is currently batting .197. 
But his tantrum more than his poor hitting is what caused Manager Tom Lasorda 
to bench him for the third consecutive game, giving the start to Eddie Pye. 
It's a choice Lasorda didn't have before Pye was called up from Albuquerque on 
May 31, because there wasn't anyone on the bench who could play shortstop well 
enough.  
</P>
<P>
 " . . . I don't think anything that happens is going to affect me anymore," 
Offerman said. "This is the first time in my career I have ever sat out (like 
this) and I never thought it would happen. It is tough." 
</P>
<P>
 And his tantrum? 
</P>
<P>
 "All that (stems) from my frustrations because I am not hitting the ball 
good," Offerman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some critics contend that Offerman would play much better with another team. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like this organization, that's for sure," he said. "There a lot of things 
that are good here and it's different than the others, there's no question. But 
if someday I have to go, I'd be happy to go."

BASEBALL DAILY REPORT; ANGELS; ROYAL SCOUT MOURNED BY JACKSON

<P>
 Angel left fielder Bo Jackson was stunned and saddened Monday when he learned 
that Ken Gonzalez -- the scout who persuaded the Kansas City Royals to draft 
Jackson in 1986 when no one believed he would play baseball -- died of an 
apparent heart attack. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's the main reason I even played baseball in Kansas City," Jackson said. 
"He talked to me and my mom, and invited us to Kansas City. He asked me if I 
was serious about playing baseball. I told him I was. The rest is history. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm telling you, baseball lost a good man and a good scout. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's scouting for the ultimate boss now." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson gave a party for the batboys and equipment managers at his home on the 
Angels' off-day last Thursday. It was the first party given exclusively for 
them since they have worked for the Angels, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson cooked 13 chickens, two slabs of ribs, corn on the cob and corn bread. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just wanted to show them how much they're appreciated," Jackson said. "They 
do an awful lot for us that nobody realizes."

 Pitcher John Farrell was placed on irrevocable waivers to make room for 
starter Brian Anderson. Anderson will be activated from the disabled list 
before tonight's game against the Minnesota Twins. The Angels invited Farrell 
to rejoin their triple-A Vancouver team, but Farrell is waiting to see if he is 
claimed by Thursday. . . . Starter Mark Langston, who had to leave after four 
innings because of a stiff left elbow in his last start, played soft toss 
Sunday and said Monday that he will be able to start Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson has been undergoing rehabilitative therapy to strengthen the muscles 
surrounding his artificial left hip, but he still is able to pinch-hit. . . . 
Second baseman Rex Hudler had to stop throwing after two attempts Monday 
afternoon, and anticipates having to remain on the disabled list for at least 
another two weeks. . . . Reliever Scott Lewis, who is on the disabled list, 
threw on the side for the first time in three weeks. BOB NIGHTENGALE

SOCCER / JULIE CART; HARKES SIMPLY WANTS TO HELP U.S. TEAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE CART 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 John Harkes has returned to the U.S. World Cup team, but has yet to join it in 
a game. Harkes and his wife, Cindy, have been taking a few days off after a 
long season with Derby County in the English First Division. 
</P>
<P>
 Derby had a chance to move up to the Premier Division next season -- it's 
called a promotion fight -- and at times the situation prompted actual fighting 
among fans. Harkes talked last week of playing Millwall, another team with a 
chance to move up, in a semifinal game. Twice the game was interrupted because 
fans charged onto the field. 
</P>
<P>
 The second time, the game was stopped and the players rushed off the field. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll never experience anything like that again," Harkes said. "I hope I 
don't, anyway. It's the first time I've ever feared for my life on the 
(field)." 
</P>
<P>
 Harkes said the second rush occurred with 15 minutes left and Derby ahead. The 
referee, who keeps the time, was counting down the clock for the players every 
few minutes so they would have some warning and get off the field as soon as 
the game was over. Even at that, they were caught in the fan uprising. 
</P>
<P>
 Harkes said he was hit in the head with something when he ran off the field 
and that Derby's goalkeeper was attacked by the fans. 
</P>
<P>
 "The intensity of the crowd was amazing," he said. "It was a passion, but it 
was an evil passion." 
</P>
<P>
 The question for Harkes when he does begin practice this week is where he will 
play. He is used to playing in the midfield but he also can play at outside 
back, where the U.S. team has a weakness. 
</P>
<P>
 "First things first," he said. "I'm just getting organized. It really doesn't 
matter where I play, as long as the whole team is on the same page. Obviously, 
there's been a lot of controversy in the media, but speculation is good, it's 
good people are talking about it. 
</P>
<P>
 "If that's where Bora (Coach Milutinovic) wants me, I'll do it, what the hell. 
I've got my own team on paper as well. Bora's got some images in his mind, it's 
got to be the right chemistry. He told me, 'I want you where there is a 
weakness. I want you to fill that weakness.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Sounds as if the decision is already made. Key to the change will be Harkes' 
attitude toward it. He has already played in one World Cup and knows the main 
thing is to get in the game. His professional attitude will no doubt help 
Milutinovic decide. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 The U.S. team is still negotiating the World Cup bonus structure, but it 
scored a victory when it was able to double the bonus for making the roster, 
from $10,000 to $20,000.

 Leigh Steinberg, who is negotiating with the U.S. Soccer Federation on behalf 
of the players, said the unresolved issues include single-games bonuses for 
starters, substitutes and bench players. Those figures have been reported to be 
$5,000 to start and $2,500 to come on as a substitute. 
</P>
<P>
 Included in the first-round bonus package is an incentive of $2,500 a player 
for each point the team earns -- one point for a tie and three points for a 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
 If the team advances beyond the first round, USSF will put $600,000 into the 
player pool, the money to be split among the players. Making the quarterfinals 
adds $800,000 to the pool, the semifinals $850,000, the finals $900,000 and 
winning the tournament $1 million.

 The issue of security fences at World Cup venues has been resolved, but not to 
the satisfaction of FIFA, the international governing body. The fences 
separating the field from the stands at Stanford Stadium in Palo Alto, RFK 
Stadium in Washington and the Cotton Bowl in Dallas will remain, despite the 
objections from FIFA and the World Cup organizers. 
</P>
<P>
 Joao Havelange, FIFA president, told reporters in Washington last week that 
fences amount to overreaction. 
</P>
<P>
 "This country stands for respect, discipline and freedom," Havelange said. "We 
are not just surprised but amazed a bit by some cities building barriers, 
fences, around the (field). In some cities, it is like a panic to put up these 
fences. Other sports, nobody even speaks about putting fences around. Up to 80% 
of the spectators will be Americans. It is like your authorities do not trust 
your own people." 
</P>
<P>
 Washington officials argue that fences are the most cost-effective method of 
securing the field. A six-foot chain link fence costs about $25,000, whereas 
overtime for police would run as much as $900,000. City officials offered to 
remove the fence if World Cup would pay the police. World Cup '94 chose not to. 
</P>
<P>
 But World Cup organizers did pay the city of Pasadena between $3.6 million and 
$4.6 million to cover security costs in the neighborhood of the Rose Bowl. It 
will cost the city $500,000 to $1 million to pay extra police throughout the 
rest of the city. 
</P>
<P>
 In a related matter, the situation with the Los Angeles Police Department and 
its continued labor problems will have minimal effect on the World Cup, even if 
the officers strike, World Cup chairman Alan Rothenberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 "LAPD is only one part of the overall integrated security plan," Rothenberg 
said. "We have all kinds of other agencies and private police. We have every 
kind of contingency." 
</P>
<P>
 LAPD officers rejected the latest contract offer and there are threats of a 
strike. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Economic figures released last week would seem to indicate that there will be 
profit-taking on both sides of the World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 Pasadena will make an estimated $700,000 from the $2-million rental of the 
Rose Bowl alone. New Jersey expects to make about $1.5 million on the renting 
of Giants Stadium and from parking and concessions. Then there is Stanford 
Stadium, where officials are estimating a loss of $500,000 to $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The athletic department expects to spend about $2.2 million to improve the 
stadium, one of the oldest of the World Cup venues. That cost will probably 
offset income from parking, concessions and a $500,000 payment from the San 
Francisco host committee. 
</P>

 The Dutch appear to be in turmoil, but that is the way they like it. First the 
team was deflated by the abrupt departure of Ruud Gillit last week. Then Marco 
van Basten, the three-time European player of the year who needed surgery on 
his right ankle, unexpectedly announced that he was coming back to the team 
after a year of rehabilitation. 
</P>
<P>
 Then came the news that AC Milan, van Basten's Italian League team, was 
forbidding its star investment from playing on his fragile ankle. 
</P>
<P>
 "I did not expect such a hard reaction by Milan officials," van Basten said. 
"However, AC Milan's reasons are fair, and I have understood that I must accept 
them. My heart told me to go (to the World Cup), but I had to listen to 
reason."

 Desmond Armstrong, a veteran of the 1990 World Cup team who was among the last 
players cut from this year's team, has landed a job doing in-studio analysis

earthquake hitting Southern California during the World Cup: chance of a 5.0 or 
higher aftershock of the Northridge quake, 11%. Chance of a 5.0 quake in all of 
the region, 19%.

 Rates Fall on Short-Term Treasury Bills: The Treasury Department sold $12.7 
billion in new three-month bills at an average discount rate of 4.15%, down 
from 4.23% last week.Another $12.6 billion of new six-month bills was sold at 
an average discount rate of 4.53%, down from 4.67%. The new discount rates 
understate the actual return to investors: 4.25% for three-month bills, with a 
$10,000 bill selling for $9,895.10, and 4.7% for a six-month bill selling for 
$9,777.10. The discount rate reflects the price discount received when 
government securities are sold at less than face value. T-Bill Auction

THE PREPS / ERIC SHEPARD: PROBATION FOR THREE CITY PROGRAMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC SHEPARD

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Section continues to crack down in an attempt to enforce rules that 
have been paid lip service in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest action occurred last Thursday at a Rules Committee meeting when the 
Crenshaw and Carson boys' basketball programs and the Woodland Hills Taft 
football program were each put on a year's probation. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee ruled that assistant coaches at Crenshaw and Carson had coached 
players from their schools on teams not connected with the section. Coaches are 
not allowed to have contact with current or incoming players in competition 
outside the school. 
</P>
<P>
 Ade Kido of Carson and Edmond Flournoy of Crenshaw both coached all-star teams 
that had players from their schools on the rosters. The volunteer assistants 
will not be allowed to coach in the section next season. Crenshaw is the 
two-time defending State Division I champion. 
</P>
<P>
 At Taft, football Coach Troy Starr may be fired for allegedly committing 
recruiting violations by having illegal contact with several potential incoming 
players. Coaches are not allowed to have contact with players before they 
enroll or with those outside school boundaries. 
</P>
<P>
 Ron Berz, Taft's principal, said he was "disappointed and embarrassed" by the 
findings and will meet with Starr this week. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you enforce the rules, punishments are going to happen sometimes," said 
City commissioner Barbara Fiege. "Cleaning house is not easy, but I'm hoping 
things will improve as we go along." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 USA Water Polo, the sport's amateur governing body, plans to sue the Southern 
Section in hopes of changing a rule that limits contact between high school 
players and their coaches during the summer. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been enacted by Congress to develop water polo in the United States, 
and the Southern Section is standing in the way of that," said Richard Foster, 
USWP president and an attorney in Irvine. "We leave the kids alone during the 
school year, and now we're being told we have to leave them alone for part of 
the summer as well." 
</P>
<P>
 The Southern Section has a summer "dead period" for all of its sports, a 
three-week span in which coaches cannot have any contact with players from 
their team. Water polo and cross-country are the only sports in which schools 
have a choice of non-contact periods, either in June or August. 
</P>
<P>
 Foster said Southland high school coaches have been complaining to him for 
years that the rule limits participation in summer tournaments, many of which 
are held in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 Dean Crowley, Southern Section commissioner, said the rule was voted on by 
representatives from every league in the section and that no one has come to 
him about trying to change it. He said if coaches are unhappy, they should have 
gone to their league representatives. 
</P>
<P>
 Foster said the lawsuit will be filed in two or three weeks. 
</P>

 John Hattrup has resigned as girls' basketball coach at Brea-Olinda after one 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I've done everything there that I can do," Hattrup said last week. "I 
think it's time to move on and do something else." 
</P>
<P>
 Brea finished the 1993-94 season 33-0, winning the State Division III 
championship and finishing as the No. 1 team in USA Today's national poll. 
</P>
<P>
 The announcement caught Brea administrators by surprise. The popular Hattrup 
was an assistant for seven years to Mark Trakh, and the two helped build the 
Ladycats into one of the nation's premier programs. When Trakh resigned last 
summer to become the women's coach at Pepperdine, Hattrup was offered the job. 
</P>
<P>
 Hattrup was a walk-on coach who taught two physical education classes at Brea. 
Although he sought a more permanent teaching position, Brea administrators said 
they could not offer anything more.

L.A. UNIVERSITY BEAT / WENDY WITHERSPOON: REED EXPULSION SHOCKS UCLA COACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 You might think that in 10 years as UCLA's track and field coach, Bob Larsen 
would have seen it all. 
</P>
<P>
 Not so. 
</P>
<P>
 Larsen was shocked when the NCAA expelled sprinter Marcus Reed from the NCAA 
meet Saturday at Boise, Ida., for violating the honest-effort rule. 
</P>
<P>
 Reed had made a false start in the 200-meter semifinals Friday, and Red Estes, 
Fresno State's coach, filed a protest, asking to have Reed thrown out of the 
meet, saying Reed's false start had been unsportsmanlike. Larsen filed an 
appeal but it was denied. 
</P>
<P>
 False starts are common in the sprints, and athletes are often disqualified 
from the event in which they have made the false start. But it is uncommon for 
an athlete to be expelled from additional events because of one false start. 
</P>
<P>
 Larsen said he had never seen a sprinter expelled from the meet after a false 
start in one event. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that we have to be aware that when people are running multiple races, 
we shouldn't be in the business of trying to determine intent at any point in a 
race or in a meet like that," Larsen said. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier Friday, Reed had qualified for Saturday's final in the 100 meters with 
a career best of 10.18 seconds. With that time, he had a chance to finish in 
the top three in the 100. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, there was something to be gained not having Marcus in (the 100 
final), especially by Fresno State because they had an athlete in the 100, 
also," Larsen said. 
</P>
<P>
 Without Reed in the 100, Fresno State's Terry Bowen finished fourth in 10.23. 
Sam Jefferson of Houston won the event in 10.12. 
</P>
<P>
 Estes could not be reached for comment Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 For Reed, a senior who won the 100 and 200 in the Pacific 10 Conference meet 
at Pullman, Wash., last month, there was nothing to do but deal with the 
disappointment of not being able to run in the national meet. 
</P>
<P>
 "The sprints are really like a gunfight," Larsen said. "You're making instant 
decisions, you're very hyped up, you're running multiple races over several 
days and you know at any point that it can end. 
</P>
<P>
 "Marcus is a very strong individual and he was very disappointed because he 
knew that he could be one of the top runners, if not win, in the final. But he 
took it in a mature way and started looking ahead to running well in the USA 
Track and Field Championships (June 14-18 at Knoxville, Tenn.)." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The USC men's team finished 10th with 20 points in the NCAA meet, quite low 
considering the Trojans have won a record 26 NCAA team championships in the 
sport. Still, Coach Jim Bush found a reason to be proud. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never been excited to finish 10th," said Bush, who led UCLA to five 
national championships between 1965 and '84 before taking over the USC program 
in 1991. "But I am (this time) because we beat all the Pac-10 schools." 
</P>
<P>
 The next Pac-10 team was UCLA, which finished 12th with 18 points. UCLA won 
the Pac-10 meet with 135 points; USC was second with 121.5. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't have a lot of superstars. . . . (But) I would rate them with my 
five national championship teams at UCLA as far as effort (goes)," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 University Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Two Southland teams won NCAA championships during the academic year, and many 
local athletes won NCAA individual titles. . . . The Long Beach State women's 
volleyball team defeated Penn State, 15-13, 12-15, 15-11, 16-14, at Madison, 
Wis., in December for the area's first national championship of the academic 
year. . . . No other local team won an NCAA title until the USC men's tennis 
team beat Stanford, 4-3, at South Bend, Ind., on May 24 to repeat as national 
champions. 
</P>
<P>
 Several other Trojan teams came close to winning national titles. USC's water 
polo team lost to Stanford, 11-9, in the NCAA final at Belmont Plaza pool in 
November, and its women's golf team placed second in the NCAA behind Arizona 
State at Portland, Ore., on May 28. . . . The UCLA men's volleyball team also 
finished second nationally when it lost to Penn State, 15-13, 4-15, 15-12, 
15-12, in the NCAA final last month at Ft. Wayne, Ind. 
</P>
<P>
 Individually, Kristine Quance, a freshman, led the way for USC, winning four 
championships in the NCAA women's swimming and diving meet at Indianapolis in 
March. Quance won the 200-yard individual medley, the 400 IM and the 200 
breaststroke and was a member of the winning 800 freestyle relay team. . . . 
Brian Earley won a national title on the platform for the Trojans in the NCAA 
men's swimming and diving meet at Minneapolis in March, and Balazs Kiss, a 
sophomore, won his second consecutive NCAA hammer throw championship last week. 
</P>
<P>
 For UCLA, John Godina led the way in individual titles by winning the shotput 
in the NCAA indoor meet at Indianapolis in March and the discus at the NCAA 
outdoor meet last week. Amy Acuff won the high jump in the NCAA indoor meet, 
and Karen Hecox the 3,000 meters in the NCAA outdoor meet. . . . In gymnastics, 
Jim Foody won the high bar and Steve McCain won the vault for UCLA in the NCAA 
men's gymnastics meet in April at Lincoln, Neb.

YIELDS FALL ON FED INTERVIEW; STOCKS MIXED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Bond yields dropped to six-week lows Monday, spurred by a newspaper report 
suggesting that the Federal Reserve Board expects stable interest rates for the 
near future. 
</P>
<P>
 But the stock market failed to take heart from the latest bond rally, and blue 
chip indexes eased. The Dow industrials slipped 3.70 points to 3,768.52 in 
light trading. 
</P>
<P>
 In the bond market, the rally that began last week picked up steam in the wake 
of a New York Times report on the mood at the nation's central bank. 
</P>
<P>
 The story said three of the five Fed governors interviewed expressed belief 
that economic growth has slowed and that inflation is under control. 
</P>
<P>
 Some bond investors inferred from the article that the Fed won't boost 
short-term interest rates further anytime soon. If the Fed holds steady and the 
economy slows, many economists believe, long-term interest rates could continue 
to fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Bond traders seized on the New York Times article Monday to push the yield on 
30-year Treasury bonds down to 7.22% from 7.26% on Friday. The 30-year bond 
yield hasn't been that low since April 27. 
</P>
<P>
 Short-term yields also fell Monday. The yield on two-year T-notes dropped to 
5.77% from 5.86%. 
</P>
<P>
 "My sense is, we've had a turn in psychology," said William Stevens, a 
managing director at Montgomery Asset Management, a Walnut Creek, Calif., 
investment firm with $3 billion in assets. "People won't mind (owning bonds) if 
the Fed's on hold for a while." 
</P>
<P>
 Bonds were also bolstered by another plunge in grain prices, as weekend 
showers in the Midwest and forecasts for more rain this week dispelled concern 
that dry weather could damage crops. 
</P>
<P>
 Soybeans for November delivery, which represent this year's crop, slumped 
28.75 cents to $6.31 a bushel. July corn futures slid 8 cents to $2.66 a 
bushel. 
</P>
<P>
 Lumber futures also lost ground, on expectations of slower demand for new 
homes this summer. Lumber for July delivery fell $10 to $383.30 per thousand 
board feet. 
</P>
<P>
 The Commodity Research Bureau index of key commodities, which recently hit a 3 
1/2-year high, tumbled 3.21 points, or 1.4%, to 228.84. 
</P>
<P>
 With each decline in commodity prices, fear of higher inflation also ebbs, 
encouraging more investors to buy bonds, analysts note. Or at least to buy U.S. 
bonds: While yields continue to fall here, European bond yields are rising as 
investors bail out on signs of economic strength. 
</P>
<P>
 German and British bond yields rose again Monday. The turmoil in European bond 
markets is believed to be driving some investors out of those bonds and into 
the U.S. market. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the dollar gained again against the German mark Monday, a sign that 
money is moving from German to U.S. securities. In New York, the dollar rose to 
1.671 marks from 1.670 on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the U.S. bond market's rally, stocks closed mixed. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow industrials had been up more than 20 points late in the day, before 
"program" selling hit. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a typical, low-volume, profit-taking type of day," said Tony Dwyer, 
chief market strategist at Sherwood Research. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the broad market was fairly strong: Winners topped losers by 13 to 8 on 
the NYSE and by 14 to 12 on Nasdaq. The Nasdaq composite index added 1.05 
points to 743.43. 
</P>
<P>
 Many analysts believe stocks can mount a strong rally soon if interest rates 
ease further. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Monday's highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Microsoft jumped 1 5/8 to 54 1/2 on record Nasdaq volume of 47.8 million 
shares. As previously announced, the stock was added to the Standard & Poor's 
500 index at the close of trading Monday. The addition of a stock to the index 
prompts purchases by investment funds that seek to replicate the index's 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
 * Health maintenance organization shares rallied, and some hit all-time highs. 
U.S. HealthCare soared 1 7/8 to 42 after Salomon Bros. repeated its "buy" 
rating. 
</P>
<P>
 Other HMO gainers included PacifiCare A shares, up 1 1/2 to 59 3/4; FHP, up 
7/8 to 25 1/4, and United Healthcare, up 7/8 to 50 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
 * Builders' stocks rose, which some analysts tied to falling lumber prices. 
Centex surged 1 3/8 to 26 1/2, Kaufman & Broad added 3/8 to 16 and Ryland was 
up 3/8 to 18 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
 * On the downside, Times parent Times Mirror tumbled 3 to 32 3/4. The stock 
had jumped 3 3/4 on Friday on news that the company will spin off its cable 
subsidiary. 
</P>
<P>
 * Computer retailer CompUSA slid 2 5/8 to 9 3/8. It said late Friday that 
financial results in the current quarter won't meet expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 Overseas, Tokyo's Nikkei index was hit by profit takers and dropped 227.54 
points to 20,726.65. 
</P>
<P>
 In Europe, Frankfurt's DAX average gained 14.68 points to 2,163.07 and 
London's FTSE-100 index added 11.6 points to 3,009.4. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexico City's Bolsa index rose 29.86 points to 2,494.84.

THE BIZ / JOHN LIPPMAN: COMPANY TOWN; NEW NETWORKS STRUGGLE TO FIND NICHE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN LIPPMAN

<TEXT>
<P>
 Not long ago, the Big Three broadcast networks liked to boast that they were 
"programming supermarkets" with something for everyone: mainstream prime-time 
comedies and dramas, news, sports, cartoons for kids, soap operas for 
housewives and late-night talk shows for insomniacs. 
</P>
<P>
 But the concept of providing all things to all viewers is going the way of 
Mayberry: It represents a quaint and nostalgic view of TV's uncomplicated past. 
In its place has come niche programming -- the progeny of an industry that may 
soon have more airspace than ideas. 
</P>
<P>
 With channel expansion on the way, cable TV operators and entrepreneurs are 
scrambling to find creative ways to fill the void and overcome obstacles to 
success. In this brave new world of programming, no concept seems too trivial. 
Indeed, cable TV programming may look like the newsstand magazine rack of the 
future as "niche networks" spill onto the channel pipeline. 
</P>
<P>
 By definition, a niche network is a cable channel whose programming is so 
narrow in appeal that it may attract only a few hundred thousand viewers, or at 
the most a couple of million -- similar to the readership that highly targeted 
specialty magazines reach. In a sense, CNN and MTV are niche networks because 
of their focus on a narrow slice of the TV audience. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, the focus of cable networks has become more and more 
niche-oriented, as they seek to appeal to viewers with singular interests. E! 
Entertainment Network is targeted to viewers obsessed with the entertainment 
world -- the company recently signed a deal to videotape the radio broadcasts 
of shock jock Howard Stern, for example -- while the History Channel is 
designed to attract a core audience of history buffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, no concept appears too parochial for a cable TV network in 
development. 
</P>
<P>
 At last month's cable TV convention in New Orleans, more than 100 new cable 
networks jostled frantically to get off the ground. The convention floor was 
jammed with hopefuls such as the Arts & Antique Network, the Auto Channel 
(which would compete with Automotive Television Network), Booknet, Cable Health 
Club, Cupid Network TV (home shopping for "adult novelty love and romance 
products"), Fitness Interactive, the Talk Channel, Television Food Network -- 
not to mention the Arts & Crafts Needle Network. 
</P>
<P>
 The advent of niche networks made possible by the expected expansion of 
channel space on local cable TV systems in the coming years was an important 
reason that Times Mirror Co. and Cox Cable Communications Inc. formed a 
$300-million joint venture Monday to develop programming and other services for 
the information superhighway. 
</P>
<P>
 The joint venture, which was part of Times Mirror's $2.3-billion sale of its 
cable TV division to Cox Cable parent Cox Enterprises Inc., will first try to 
launch the Outdoor Life Channel, a new cable network inspired by such Times 
Mirror-owned magazines as Outdoor Life and Field & Stream. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the well-heeled venture and the overall level of interest in niche 
networks, it is far from the best time to launch such projects. Besides the 
high cost of starting a new network, there are also regulatory and technical 
obstacles. Some suggest that only the most well-established players will 
survive. 
</P>
<P>
 "This has been the worst year ever," sighs Jay Levin, president of Planet 
Central, a Santa Monica-based aspiring cable TV channel that will focus on the 
environment. Levin, the founder of L.A. Weekly, has been working on his cable 
TV network for more than two years and thinks that no more than two dozen of 
the 100 or so new networks will ever get off the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 For starters, launching a new cable network can run from $15 million to $75 
million in losses before turning a profit, making inability to raise capital a 
major obstacle. In addition, cable TV regulations discourage operators from 
adding new networks to subscribers' basic service, making it tougher to gain 
wide distribution necessary to attract advertising. 
</P>
<P>
 That leaves cable system operators with little choice but to introduce new 
networks "a la carte," meaning the subscriber pays an additional fee -- usually 
between $1.50 and $3 a month -- to subscribe to the network. The problem is 
that many cable systems are not yet technically capable of passing along the 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
 If only two dozen or so niche networks survive the shakeout, what will appear 
on the other 475 or so channels? Most of the extra channel space carved out by 
digital compression will be given over to pay-per-view movie channels, video 
games and home shopping. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, the notion of 500-channel cable TV systems is something of a 
misnomer. The idea of a "channel," in fact, is expected to vanish. Instead, 
cable TV viewers will be able to select what they want to watch with the help 
of an on-screen navigation system that will point the way to clicking on the 
show or network they want to watch "on demand." 
</P>
<P>
 That's important because many of the so-called niche networks won't be 
networks as viewers typically understand them today, where the programming is 
continuously fed through cable lines and over the airwaves. Instead it will be 
digitally stored and might change at given intervals -- similar to the way a 
new magazine arrives every week or month. 
</P>
<P>
 But proliferation of the new channels and networks doesn't necessarily mean 
gripping television. And that in itself may prevent many of the niche networks 
from going forward. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of them don't deserve to get anointed," Levin said. "They are really 
boring."

 NO CRACKDOWN: The arrest of 17 alleged bookmakers (A1) should not strike fear 
in the hearts of office poolers. Sheriff's Lt. David Kading said that while 
gambling at the office is illegal, cracking down on informal Super Bowl pools 
among friends at work is not a priority."We take action against people selling 
pools only on complaint," said Kading.

 VOTE VETERAN: After 44 years as a precinct inspector, Theresa Wessig, 68, has 
seen it all on election day. . . . That includes a stack of misplaced ballots. 
When the Canoga Park woman saw them lying neglected on the floor on her first 
election night, she promptly passed out. Wessig, who didn't finish the recount 
that morning until 4 a.m., laments today's low voter turnouts and cynicism but 
has not become cynical herself. "I always think it will get better," she said. 
Voters go to the polls today to cast ballots in a variety of races.

 FIVE O'CLOCK WORLD: For thousands of young people, the livin' isn't easy in 
the summertime. They are punching time clocks on a variety of jobs as movie 
ushers and swimming instructors. And they are the lucky ones. Despite signs of 
economic recovery in the San Fernando Valley, youth unemployment is close to a 
five-year high. (Valley Business, page 10) John Johnson

SISTER MAGDALEN; EX-PRESIDENT OF MT. ST. MARY'S 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MYRNA OLIVER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sister Magdalen Coughlin, the former president of Mount St. Mary's College who 
built the school into a national model of multicultural education serving the 
changing demographics of Southern California, died Monday. She was 64. 
</P>
<P>
 Sister Magdalen, who was president from 1976 to 1989 and later became the 
first person to hold the college's title of chancellor, died peacefully in her 
sleep after a long bout with cancer, according to college spokeswoman Lucy Lee. 
The sister's family was at her bedside at Daniel Freeman Memorial Hospital in 
Inglewood. 
</P>
<P>
 Under Sister Magdalen's leadership, the school that once served affluent Anglo 
women became increasingly diverse, welcoming Latina, African American and Asian 
students from a full spectrum of economic, cultural and educational 
backgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
 She helped to develop diversity in both the two-year program at the college's 
Doheny Campus on the former Doheny estate on Chester Place in Downtown Los 
Angeles and the four-year liberal arts program on the Chalon campus in West Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Sister Magdalen allocated grant money and other college funds to support 
multicultural research and teaching. Even after leaving the presidency, she 
continued to raise funds and promote programs to assist underprivileged 
students. 
</P>
<P>
 Ever an ambassador for the college run by her Sisters of St. Joseph of 
Carondolet, Sister Magdalen helped Mount St. Mary's gain national recognition 
and respect as a top liberal arts college. 
</P>
<P>
 Urging her students to become "engaged in the common good," she set a personal 
example as a presence in the community. She was named to a variety of boards 
and committees, many through connections made at the Trusteeship for the 
Betterment of Women, an "old girls' club" formed in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time of her death, Sister Magdalen served on the Mayor's Advisory Panel 
on Ethics in Charity, the advisory board of the American Jewish Committee's 
Skirball Institute on American Values, the board of trustees of the J. Paul 
Getty Trust, and the board of directors of the Southern California Assn. of 
Philanthropy. 
</P>
<P>
 She had also served on boards of St. John's Seminary College in Camarillo and 
St. Catherine's College in St. Paul, Minn., the Carrie Estelle Doheny 
Foundation, the American Council on Education, the Los Angeles Commission on 
the Status of Women and the California Council for the Humanities. 
</P>
<P>
 "And the important thing," commented former Times columnist Zan Thompson, 
herself a 1980 graduate of Mount St. Mary's, "is that the other members of 
these bodies each think that Sister devotes her time unstintingly to that one. 
She does. She seems to have found some marvelous, bottomless sea of time and 
energy so that everything she turns her hand to gets her complete attention." 
</P>
<P>
 At the Trusteeship for the Betterment of Women, Sister Magdalen rubbed elbows 
with such powerful contemporaries as appeals court Justice Joan Dempsey Klein, 
singer Helen Reddy, Motown Productions President Suzanne de Passe and aviator 
and investor Brooke Knapp. She named some to her own college board. Sister 
Magdalen told The Times in 1987 that she welcomed sharing with the prominent 
women such stressful issues as how to fire people and lighter ones such as 
whether she should wear a habit. 
</P>
<P>
 Born Patricia Coughlin in Wenatchee, Wash., Sister Magdalen was the only 
daughter and one of four children of William and Cecilia Coughlin. 
</P>
<P>
 A teacher before she became an administrator, Sister Magdalen earned a 
bachelor's degree in history and social sciences from the College of St. 
Catherine, a master's in medieval history at Mount St. Mary's and a doctorate 
in American history from USC. She also spent a year studying history at the 
University of Nijmegen in the Netherlands on a Fulbright scholarship. 
</P>
<P>
 Sister Magdalen taught history at Alemany High School in San Fernando in the 
1960-61 school year, and at St. Mary's Academy in Los Angeles for the next two 
years, then began teaching at Mount St. Mary's in 1963. She served as dean for 
academic development there from 1970 to 1974, and spent two years as regional 
superior of her order before taking over the college presidency. 
</P>
<P>
 Among her honors were the YWCA Achievement Award in 1982, the Women of 
Business Award in 1984, the Big Sister Woman of Achievement Award in 1986 and 
the Los Angeles Dodgers Education Hero award in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 She is survived by three brothers, John, Joseph and Thomas Coughlin, who live 
in the Seattle area. 
</P>
<P>
 The funeral liturgy is scheduled for 7:30 p.m. Thursday at the Carondolet 
Center Chapel, 11999 Chalon Road in Brentwood, after viewing hours beginning at 
1:30 p.m. and a rosary at 4:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Memorial contributions can be made to the Sister Magdalen Coughlin Endowed 
Scholarship Fund at Mount St. Mary's College, 12001 Chalon Road, Los Angeles, 
CA 90049.

ISH KABIBBLE; COMIC TRUMPET PLAYER FOR KAY KYSER BAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MYRNA OLIVER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ish Kabibble, the lovable and silly comedic trumpet player with Kay Kyser's 
"Kollege of Musical Knowledge," has died. He was 86. 
</P>
<P>
 Kabibble, whose real name was Merwyn Bogue, died Sunday in Palm Springs. 
</P>
<P>
 Taking his stage name from the lyrics of one of the goofy songs in his 
routine, Kabibble also managed Kyser's band from 1931 to 1951, during the 
height of the Big Band era. 
</P>
<P>
 Born in Erie, Pa., Kabibble set out to study law at West Virginia University. 
But he segued into music after hearing Paul Whiteman's band play in Erie. 
</P>
<P>
 Kabibble, with his hair combed straight down toward his eyebrows, was always 
introduced by Kyser on his network radio show as "the guy with the low-cut 
bangs and the high-kicking cornet." 
</P>
<P>
 Fans enjoyed Kabibble's occasional jazz solos, but they preferred his 
nonsensical attacks on logic, such as: 
</P>
<P>
 "No matter how much you know about one thing, there's always something else 
you ain't as good at as, because if you was, you wouldn't be as good at the 
thing you are at now, if you are?" 
</P>
<P>
 As an Army private, Kabibble helped Kyser's group entertain troops during 
World War II. He delighted soldiers and civilians alike with his observations 
that water is ice standing at ease; that wind comes in different sizes such as 
breezes, cyclones and top sergeants, and that skin is stuff that, if you didn't 
have it, the rest of you would be AWOL. 
</P>
<P>
 He also offered corny poems such as: 
</P>
<P>
 "I sneezed a sneeze into the air; 
</P>
<P>
 it fell to earth I know not where; 
</P>
<P>
 but you should have seen the looks on those 
</P>
<P>
 in whose vicinity I snoze." 
</P>
<P>
 After the big bands declined in popularity, Kabibble went into selling real 
estate. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1989, with the help of his sister, Gladys Bogue Reilly, Kabibble wrote his 
well-received memoirs, "Ish Kabibble: The Autobiography of Merwyn Bogue." 
</P>
<P>
 He is survived by his wife of more than six decades, Janet; their three 
children, Merwyn Jr. of San Francisco, Pamela Gilbert of Denver and Janet Arnot 
of Desert Hot Springs, Calif., and eight grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
 At the musician's request, there will be no public funeral services.

<P>
 Born in New York City, Sullivan worked as a theater usher and department store 
buyer before making his Broadway debut in 1936.

</P>
<P>
 After World War II, he played the defense attorney in "The Caine Mutiny Court 
Martial." 
</P>
<P>
 He had the role of disgruntled husband Tom Buchanan in the 1949 version of 
"The Great Gatsby." 
</P>
<P>
 Sullivan played a film director in 1953's "The Bad and the Beautiful." 
</P>
<P>
 Other Sullivan films included "The Gangster," 1947; "The Outriders," 1950;

1969; "Earthquake," 1974; and "Oh God," 1977. 
</P>
<P>
 Sullivan also was active in television, starring in the series "Harbourmaster" 
from 1957 to 1958; "The Tall Man," a Western that ran from 1960 to 1962, and 
"The Road West" in 1966 and 1967. 
</P>
<P>
 He played a fugitive war criminal in 1969's "Night Gallery," Steven 
Spielberg's televised three-story anthology. 
</P>
<P>
 Sullivan is survived by two daughters, theatrical director Jenny Sullivan and 
Patsy Sullivan Webb, who is married to singer-songwriter Jimmy Webb; and a son,

LOCAL COLLEGES MAY SLASH CLASSES, JOBS IN FACE OF SHORTFALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 Layoffs of part-time teachers and cuts in class schedules are a threat this 
fall at Moorpark, Oxnard and Ventura colleges because of a cash shortage that 
has more than doubled in recent months, district officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County Community College District officials said a $1.4-million 
deficit announced earlier this year has now mushroomed to $3 million, prompting 
trustees to consider sweeping curriculum cuts and staff layoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are in tough straits to figure out how to find money at the end of the 
fiscal year of this magnitude," said Vice Chancellor Jeff Marsee. 
</P>
<P>
 Administrators blame the ballooning $3-million budget gap on 
lower-than-expected property tax revenues, a decline they said is due to 
sinking real estate values and miscalculations by state analysts. 
</P>
<P>
 "The anticipated revenue from local property taxes was higher than the revenue 
that actually occurred," said Marsee, who is in line for a three-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we're having to do now is recognize that 5% funding reduction with very 
little time to take any corrective action," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Faced with a similar fiscal crisis this time last year, the district pared 300 
courses from its class schedules. 
</P>
<P>
 By late 1993, when the state came up with extra money for the district, most 
of those classes were reinstated. 
</P>
<P>
 But fewer classes and higher student fees resulted in an 8% dip in enrollment, 
further lowering state allocations to the district. 
</P>
<P>
 In February, trustee Timothy Hirschberg and other board members called for a 
districtwide restructuring of the curriculum to refocus on only the most 
popular courses: vocational programs and core classes widely transferable to 
universities. 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing to date has come from that proposal, Hirschberg said. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Trustees will probably adopt a tentative budget for the coming fiscal year 
later this month. But adjustments to that spending plan will need to be made 
following the adoption of a state budget, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Partly because of the district's budget problems, some trustees are 
criticizing a proposal by Chancellor Thomas G. Lakin to offer dozens of his 
top-level managers multiyear contracts that would protect them from salary cuts 
or even layoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 At a board meeting tonight, Lakin is scheduled to ask trustees to approve 
three-year contracts for his two vice chancellors and two-year contracts for 
dozens of academic directors, deans and college vice presidents. 
</P>
<P>
 Lakin could not be reached for comment Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Offering multiyear contracts to dozens of top managers within the district is 
necessary to continue attracting the best candidates from across the country, 
Marsee said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The intention is to establish a positive environment for future hires," he 
said. "Philosophically, I'm sure there's a concern, but practicality-wise 
there's really no difference." 
</P>
<P>
 Last month the district imposed a hiring freeze due to its reduced revenues. 
</P>
<P>
 The long-term pacts would obligate the district to pay millions of dollars in 
administrative salaries over three years at a time when a majority of seats on 
the governing board are up for grabs. Three of five board members face 
reelection this November. 
</P>
<P>
 Governing board members contacted Monday were reluctant to support the 
multiyear contract proposal, which has been tabled from each of the two 
previous board meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to vote against it," said trustee Gregory P. Cole. "I'm not going 
to support the proposal in light of the new fiscal evaluations." 
</P>
<P>
 When the three-year deals for the vice chancellors were proposed last month, 
however, Cole indicated he may support them. 
</P>
<P>
 Hirschberg said: "It's ludicrous to be extending management contracts. It 
completely ties the board's hands." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of considering teacher layoffs or cutting class schedules, the 
district should target the very managers Lakin wants protected by long-term 
contracts, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "My first priorities for cuts would be to begin a process that I thought we 
should have begun last year, consolidating middle management," Hirschberg said. 
"They're first on my list." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Union activists charged Monday that the lengthy deals would undermine the 
community college district's prime objective: offering affordable vocational 
courses and classes transferable to four-year universities. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's infuriating and insulting, but more than that it's destructive to the 
community college system," said Barbara Hoffman, president of the local 
teachers union. "There's anticipation that the board is going to change 
dramatically." 
</P>
<P>
 Leanne Colvin, president of the classified employees union that is in the 
midst of heated bargaining negotiations, said the multiyear deals were 
hypocritical. 
</P>
<P>
 "They pulled a 1% pay raise off the table for classified employees last month, 
saying they couldn't afford it," Colvin said. "We haven't been able to get a 
straight answer from them on anything." 
</P>
<P>
 A teacher at one of the three campuses said Lakin and his colleagues 
traditionally seek back-room deals like multiyear contracts during the slow 
summer months. 
</P>
<P>
 "The history of management in this district has always been that the big 
changes and the big perks that go to management are made when school's out and 
everybody's on vacation," the instructor said. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the time when they hit with big commitments like this," said the 
teacher, who asked to be unnamed. "It's easier for them to sneak something 
through."

PETITIONS FOR LANDFILL BALLOT INITIATIVE FILED; TRASH: FIRM PUSHING THE 
PROPOSED WELDON CANYON FACILITY WANTS A VOTE. OPPONENTS QUESTION THE TACTICS 
USED TO GAIN SIGNATURES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The firm pushing to build a landfill at Weldon Canyon turned in nearly twice 
the required number of petition signatures Monday to put the question to 
Ventura County voters this fall. 
</P>
<P>
 But opponents, charging that Taconic Resources misled county residents to 
secure the 32,994 names, vowed to use any legal means necessary to keep the 
initiative off the November ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not surprised that they have the amount of signatures, given the 
tactics they used," said Nina Shelley, an Ojai City Council member who opposes 
the project. "If it does get on the ballot, we intend to go forward" with legal 
challenges, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Taconic is trying to accomplish what another waste management company failed 
to do after a decade of effort: Get past the county Board of Supervisors and 
win local support for a landfill in the rugged canyon between Ojai and Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 Starting the petition drive barely three weeks before the June 6 deadline, the 
San Diego County firm hired a political consultant and petition gatherers who 
signed up one in 20 county voters in support of the project. Company 
representatives turned in 75% more than the 18,753 signatures needed at the 
county registrar of voters office Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "The reason we were able to do this so quickly and so thoroughly is that the 
people support this initiative," said Larry Reemer, the San Diego political 
consultant who directed the drive. "You can't manufacture support of this depth 
and this breadth. I have to admit, for a trash dump it really surprised me." 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters said names came from across the county, with only Ojai and Ventura 
voters balking at the project. "There's a lot of support in Oxnard, Camarillo 
and Santa Paula," said Scott Montgomery, a Moorpark City Council member who 
supports the landfill proposal. "Basically there is broad-based support in 
eight of the 10 cities." 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed dump would take all the non-recyclable trash from Ventura, 
Oxnard, Ojai and Camarillo, proponents say.  
</P>
<P>
 Opponents fear that the 551-acre landfill would also draw waste from Los 
Angeles County and other states. They say county voters did not always know 
what they were signing. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have misrepresented this right from the beginning," said Doris Black, 
who lives about 2,000 feet from the canyon. "I think it's unfair that the 
people signing it have no idea this is going to be a mega-dump." 
</P>
<P>
 Ruth Shimer of Ventura was leaving Wal-Mart in Oxnard one day when a man asked 
her to sign a petition in support of a recycling center at Weldon Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 "Isn't it a landfill?" she recalled asking him. He finally acknowledged that 
it was after she pointed out the landfill language on the petition, said 
Shimer, who complained to Shelley about the incident. 
</P>
<P>
 Velta Teegarden of Oak View encountered a man looking for signatures outside 
the Price Club in Oxnard. Three times he told her that signing the petition 
could stop the canyon project, she said. Finally, he admitted that it would put 
the issue on the November ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 Project supporters acknowledged that about five of the 60 to 70 paid and 
volunteer signature gatherers had "tended to be misleading." 
</P>
<P>
 "We had enough complaints brought to our attention (and) they were fired," 
said Jim Jevens, a consultant for Taconic Resources who also worked on the 
project for Waste Management Inc., the original company pushing the landfill. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Teegarden called the Oxnard Police Department about the petition incident, but 
officers said they could take no action. Likewise, the voter registrar's office 
can do nothing about false oral claims as long as the written material on the 
petition is accurate, said assistant registrar Bruce Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
 "As the petition process gets more utilized and abused, perhaps there will be 
legislation" to deal with false claims, Bradley said. 
</P>
<P>
 The registrar's office must now certify the names and signatures on the 
petitions, a task that could be delayed a week or two because of today's 
election. Once the petitions are certified, the Board of Supervisors is legally 
bound to place the issue on the ballot, Bradley said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The don't have any alternatives," he said. "It's a formality." 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Maggie Kildee, an opponent of the landfill, said she has asked the 
county counsel to advise the board on possible options for stopping the measure 
from getting on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like blocking a vote of the people, and I certainly am not in favor of 
doing that," Kildee said. "But I don't think this is the right way to go about 
a land-use decision." 
</P>
<P>
 Ojai leaders hope to persuade the county board to dismiss the ballot 
initiative for legal reasons. The Ojai City Council has discussed the issue in 
closed session but has declined to reveal its legal strategy. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members have argued that the company cannot use a ballot initiative to 
circumvent the will of the county board on a land-use issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Waste Management Inc. withdrew its proposal for the landfill when 
it became clear that a majority of the supervisors would not approve the 
project. Taconic's petition drive effectively goes around the board, while 
still leaving the landfill subject to various county and state regulatory 
agencies. NEXT STEP 
</P>
<P>
 The Ventura County registrar of voters must examine the Weldon Canyon 
petitions to make sure the names belong to registered voters and that the 
signatures match those on county records. The certification process will 
probably be delayed for two to three weeks because of today's election. After 
certification, the measure would go to the county Board of Supervisors. Barring 
a legal problem, the board is required to place the initiative on the November 
ballot, officials said.

ELECTIONS; LAST DIGS IN VENTURA RACES KICK UP MUD; THE CONTEST FOR SUPERVISOR'S 
SEAT TAKES ON NASTY TONE, AS DOES REPUBLICAN PRIMARY FOR CONGRESS. OAK PARK 
VOTES ON CITYHOOD OR ANNEXATION. 
</P>

<P>
 Ventura County voters go to the polls today to choose two new county 
supervisors in races that have taken an increasingly nasty tone with 
accusations of misleading voters through last-minute political ads. 
</P>
<P>
 In calmer contests, voters in Oak Park voice their opinions on cityhood or 
possible annexation to Thousand Oaks, and residents of Port Hueneme decide 
whether to raise their taxes in order to keep their city police department. 
</P>
<P>
 Voters across the county will pick candidates for Superior Court judge, county 
auditor-controller, tax assessor, clerk and recorder and superintendent of 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Also on the ballot are six primary races for the state Legislature and 
Congress, including a bitter five-way race in the Republican primary for the 
seat held by Rep. Anthony Beilenson (D-Woodland Hills). 
</P>
<P>
 Polls will open at 7 a.m. at 404 locations around the county and close at 8 
p.m. Election officials expect only about 38% of the county's 339,356 
registered voters to cast ballots. 
</P>
<P>
 The final days of the spring election season have been marked by a flurry of 
campaign mailers, television commercials and radio and newspaper ads aimed at 
swaying undecided voters. Some of them stand accused of being political attack 
ads. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, county supervisorial candidate Trudi K. Loh, a political 
newcomer, fired off one campaign mailer late last week attacking opponents 
Frank Schillo and Madge Schaefer. 
</P>
<P>
 The mailer featured pictures of the Thousand Oaks councilman and former 
Ventura County supervisor next to newspaper headlines about crime, homelessness 
and the jobless rate. 
</P>
<P>
 "Can yesterday's politicians keep tomorrow's Ventura County from becoming 
L.A.?" the mailer's headline asks against a photo of the Los Angeles skyline. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Schillo, who refers to his opponent as "Trudi Loh-blow," and Schaefer 
denounced the mailer, saying it contained inaccurate and misleading information 
about their public records. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a campaign of deception," Schaefer said. "Instead of talking about her 
credentials, she's chosen to be negative." 
</P>
<P>
 Loh defended the mailer and its contents, and also accused her opponents of 
trying to smear her own integrity by faxing anonymous letters and memos to 
reporters questioning her background and experience as an attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're screaming about my campaign," she said. "But what about the things 
they've been doing? There's been a lot of mudslinging going on." 
</P>
<P>
 In a local newspaper ad on Monday, Schillo appeared to take issue with Loh and 
other first-time candidates for lacking government experience. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not the time for a learn-as-you-go supervisor," the ad declared. 
"This is the time for experience and leadership!" 
</P>
<P>
 The other two candidates in the 2nd District supervisor race are taxpayer 
advocate H. Jere Robings and rancher Carter Ward. 
</P>
<P>
 Voters in the 4th Supervisorial District have also been inundated with mailers 
and newspaper ads during the past week -- but of a more low-key nature. The 
candidates are Simi Valley Councilwomen Barbara Williamson and Judy Mikels, 
Moorpark Councilman Scott Montgomery and parks official James Meredith. 
</P>
<P>
 Mailers sent out by Williamson's campaign emphasize her law enforcement and 
firefighter endorsements, while Mikels' and Montgomery's ads and mailers 
trumpet their government experience. Mikels' ads also note her support from 
Ventura County Supervisor Vicky Howard and features a picture of her shaking 
hands with Simi Valley Mayor Greg Stratton, who has not endorsed any candidate 
in the race. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, in the Republican primary for the Beilenson's seat, tempers have 
flared over how long some candidates have lived in the 24th Congressional 
District. The district stretches from Thousand Oaks to Sherman Oaks in the San 
Fernando Valley and Malibu. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Sybert, a former senior aide to Gov. Pete Wilson, has been labeled by 
his opponents as a "carpetbagger" for moving to the district less than a year 
ago to run for Congress. A former resident of Pasadena, Sybert lives in 
Calabasas. 
</P>
<P>
 For his part, Sybert has accused opponent Emery Shane, a commercial real 
estate broker and Agoura resident, of "fibbing" about living in the district 35 
years as he has stated. 
</P>
<P>
 "Public records show Mr. Shane moved out of the area in the early 1980s, and 
didn't return until less than two years ago," says a Sybert mailer. In a letter 
recently distributed to Republican voters, former state Sen. Ed Davis, a Sybert 
supporter, also raised the issue of Shane's residency. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, Shane issued a statement reiterating that he has lived in the 
district for 35 years, and that he plans to sue Sybert and Davis for libel if a 
retraction is not forthcoming. Shane also demanded a public apology from Sybert 
for spreading what he said was misleading information. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm asking Sybert for something far more important than the thousands of 
votes he stole with his deceitful campaign," Shane said. "I'm asking Sybert to 
give me back my good name." 
</P>
<P>
 Sybert could not be reached for comment, but his campaign manager James Vaughn 
said that Sybert had voter registration records showing that Shane lived 
"nowhere near the district between 1985 and 1992." FYI

 Polls will open at 7 a.m. at 404 locations around the county and close at 8 
p.m. For information on where your polling station is located, call: 654-2781

2 ACCUSED OF COLLECTING ON FALSE QUAKE CLAIMS; DISASTER AID: AUTHORITIES SAY 
SUSPECTS FACE PRISON AND FINES FOR FRAUDULENTLY SAYING THEY LIVED IN BUILDINGS 
DAMAGED BY THE TEMBLOR. 
</P>

<P>
 Two Ventura County residents stand accused of collecting federal emergency aid 
by falsely claiming they lived in apartments damaged by the Northridge 
earthquake, a federal prosecutor said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Arturo Cano, 27, of Fillmore and Dedria Kurtz, 27, of Ventura were arrested 
last week on suspicion of filing the false claims with the Federal Emergency 
Management Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 They are the first county residents accused of fraudulently obtaining federal 
disaster assistance made available after the earthquake jolted Southern 
California awake before dawn on Jan. 17, said Assistant U.S. Atty. Nathan J. 
Hochman. 
</P>
<P>
 Cano collected $14,400 in earthquake aid while Kurtz received $2,300, Hochman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They filed one or several claims that they lived in a certain place, when in 
fact they weren't living there" when the earthquake hit, Hochman said. "Even 
though the amount they have taken might seem somewhat small, it adds up very 
quickly." 
</P>
<P>
 At the time of the earthquake, Cano claimed he was living in the Fillmore 
Hotel, a residential hotel that was home to dozens of immigrant farm workers. 
The walls of the hotel collapsed during the quake, and the building has since 
been razed. 
</P>
<P>
 In his application for emergency aid, Cano claimed to have lost furniture, 
clothing and appliances during the quake. But FEMA investigators learned that 
Cano left the hotel in May, 1993, about eight months before the quake, Hochman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Likewise, Kurtz claimed to have lived in a Canoga Park apartment that she also 
vacated months before the earthquake, Hochman said. Under questioning by FEMA 
investigators, Kurtz admitted to filing a false claim, Hochman said.  
</P>
<P>
 Both Cano and Kurtz were arrested last week and were free Monday on $10,000 
bond. If convicted, they face a maximum sentence of five years in prison, a 
$250,000 fine and three years of supervised release. 
</P>
<P>
 With last week's arrests, 29 FEMA applicants throughout Southern California 
have now been charged with filing false claims totaling more than $100,000. Two 
applicants for Small Business Administration loans have been accused of 
fraudulently seeking more than $1.5 million, and eight retailers have been 
charged with illegally exchanging food stamps. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, authorities announced last week that two former FEMA earthquake 
damage inspectors were charged with fabricating inspection reports on 
properties they never visited. 
</P>
<P>
 Based in part on the prosecution of those who have filed fraudulent claims, 
more than $10 million in checks have been returned to FEMA. 
</P>
<P>
 Hochman said people who received money by filing fake claims should consider 
voluntarily returning the money. 
</P>
<P>
 "That would be a strong factor in considering not to prosecute them," Hochman 
said. "To date, no one who has voluntarily turned in money has been 
prosecuted." 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County residents have filed more than 7,700 applications for FEMA 
disaster aid since the Jan. 17 quake, with most residents either receiving a 
check or an explanation of why they are not eligible within weeks of filing. 
</P>
<P>
 The deadline for filing disaster claims is July 18. 
</P>
<P>
 Emergency relief workers in Ventura County say they have noticed no blatant 
abuse or fraud in the application process. 
</P>
<P>
 "From what we've seen so far, we take applications, and all of them seem 
legitimate," said Richard Piel, a manager of the earthquake relief service 
center in Fillmore. "But that's not a judgment we make. If there is a problem 
or a discrepancy, that's handled on up the line."

REDUCING THE RISK; SWIMMING: WITH SUMMER APPROACHING, AQUATICS DIRECTORS URGE 
PARENTS TO ENROLL CHILDREN IN CLASSES PLANNED THROUGHOUT THE COUNTY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 As the summer heat rises and more Ventura County residents dip into pools, 
lakes and the Pacific to cool off, safety experts say the risk of drowning 
rises as well. 
</P>
<P>
 And as schools let out and more children head for the water, aquatics 
directors all over the county are preparing to teach thousands of youngsters 
and adults how to swim safely. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlocked gates and unguarded swimming pools can prove just as deadly as ocean 
riptides to young children, said Carol Becker of the American Red Cross, 
pointing to the case of a 4-year-old Simi Valley boy who nearly drowned Sunday 
in a neighbor's pool. 
</P>
<P>
 Swimming lessons, she said, are the best protection. 
</P>
<P>
 Joshua Smith, 4, remained unconscious Monday afternoon in a Los Angeles 
pediatric intensive care unit, where he was taken after being found at the 
bottom of the pool. His condition had been upgraded from critical to fair, said 
a spokeswoman for Kaiser Permanente's Los Angeles Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really important to have people sign their kids up for swimming 
lessons," Becker said Monday. "The important thing is if you have a home pool, 
learn lifesaving skills and CPR, and don't leave children unattended." 
</P>
<P>
 In coming weeks, swimming instructors across Ventura County will offer to 
teach basic swimming skills to children as young as 4 months, for an average of 
about $35 a course. 
</P>
<P>
 Dive in now, though. 
</P>
<P>
 The pools are filling up fast -- from one-on-one private lessons in back-yard 
swim clubs to the classes that will school some 500 to 600 budding swimmers 
this summer at the Rancho Simi Parks and Recreation District in Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "We get tons" of young students, said Teri Rockhold, aquatics specialist for 
the Conejo Recreation and Park District in Thousand Oaks. "A lot of them have 
parents that can't swim. It happens more than you'd think. They're concerned 
about their own fear of the water, so they want to get their kids right in."  
</P>
<P>
 In Ventura, "the phone's just been ringing off the hook -- there's been a 
steady influx of calls from 8 to 5," said Andrea Windle, spokeswoman for the 
city's swimming program. "Our classes are growing year by year." 
</P>
<P>
 Common sense is important, too, even among experienced swimmers, safety 
experts said. 
</P>
<P>
 Most important, beach-goers should watch for rip currents, keep an eye on 
their children and swim near lifeguard stations when possible, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you've got a young kid, and they're not real comfortable with their 
ability to swim in the ocean, I wouldn't let them go out alone," said C.L. 
Price, lifeguard supervisor at San Buenaventura State Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents also should watch for rip currents -- devilishly strong sea tides 
that, under certain conditions, push unwary bathers straight out toward deep 
water. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rip currents are identified by a kind of brown, choppy water with foam on top 
-- that is where the danger is," said Erik Bear, lifeguard supervisor for the 
city of Port Hueneme. "If you are caught in one, the best thing to do is to 
relax and swim sideways until you are out of the choppy water." 
</P>
<P>
 A full complement of lifeguards will be watching bathers on Ventura County's 
coastline from Port Hueneme to Carpinteria this summer, beginning around June 
20, officials said. So far, there have been no cutbacks in lifeguard staffing. 
</P>
<P>
 A total of 18 lifeguards will be watching county-run beaches in Oxnard -- 
including Hollywood Beach, Silver Strand Beach and Harbor Beach -- from 10 a.m. 
to 6 p.m., said Jack L. Peveler, the Ventura County Harbor captain. An 
additional lifeguard will patrol the beach in a mobile unit, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 At Port Hueneme's mile-long beach, 14 lifeguards will work this summer 
beginning June 11, patrolling the waterline from 9:30 a.m. to 6 p.m. daily. 
</P>
<P>
 Starting June 19, the California Department of Recreation will station two to 
three lifeguards per day at Harbor Cove in Ventura, two at McGrath State Beach, 
eight on Buenaventura State Beach, one at Emma Wood Beach and five at 
Carpinteria, said Price, lifeguard supervisor at San Buenaventura. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, two families were already taking a careful dip at the unguarded 
section of the state beach near the Ventura Pier. 
</P>
<P>
 While Bill Foote of Tulsa, Okla., sunbathed, his wife, Debbi, kept an eye on 
their children, ages 8 to 11. 
</P>
<P>
 "He lays down and I watch the kids," Debbi Foote said. "And then we switch." 
</P>
<P>
 Nearby, Kristin Hall, a former lifeguard from Ventura, watched her sons 
Trevor, 3, and Jacob, 5, playing at the water's edge. 
</P>

 Parents can help protect their children from tragedy in the water by teaching 
them to swim, safety officials say, as well as taking a few simple safety 
precautions: 
</P>
<P>
 Swimming Pools 
</P>
<P>
 * Install child-proof fencing around back-yard pools. 
</P>
<P>
 * Learn lifesaving and CPR (cardiopulmonary resuscitation) techniques. 
</P>
<P>
 * Always have an adult who can swim watching over the children. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ocean 
</P>
<P>
 * Swim near a lifeguard station. 
</P>
<P>
 * Ask the lifeguard about water conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 * Don't let children swim in surf that is too strong for them. 
</P>
<P>
 * If caught in a rip current, swim parallel to the shore -- usually about 30 
yards -- until it eases and you can swim toward shore again. If you have a 
flotation device, hang onto it.

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: LURE OF CASH BRINGS MANY TO RECYCLING FIRM 
</P>

<P>
 Despite the availability of curbside recycling throughout Simi Valley, station 
wagons filled with bags of bottles and cans keep rolling into the parking lot 
of the city's only private recycling center. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason is as clear as the writing stamped on a can of soda: CA REDEMPTION 
VALUE. Cold hard cash. 
</P>
<P>
 "Money is 99.9% of the reason they come here," Simi Valley Recycling Center 
Inc. manager Perri Jean Schlosser said. "No matter what they say, that cash is 
what's on their minds." 
</P>
<P>
 Schlosser and her family have operated the center for nearly 20 years. They 
now have branches in Thousand Oaks and Santa Clarita, but the Simi Valley 
center does the biggest business. According to Schlosser, 150 people a day drop 
by to exchange recyclables, including paper and scrap metal, for cash. 
</P>
<P>
 The center pays about 66 cents for a pound of cans, plus scrap value. But 
Schlosser said some customers try to inflate their earnings by filling cans 
with sand, rocks, or even occasionally trying to beef up the weight by turning 
them in still full of soda.  
</P>
<P>
 Representatives from area charity groups and schools are some of her most 
faithful customers, Schlosser said. "It's an excellent fund-raiser for churches 
and civic organizations," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 As for cutting into the city's curbside recycling business, Schlosser said 
that isn't a problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Hreha the deputy director of the city's Environmental Services Department, 
agreed. He said the city encourages use of private recycling centers. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the city's "Toucan" campaign to expand the curbside program has been a 
success. By allowing people to recycle more items at the curb, including more 
yard waste, Hreha said the city has been able to divert nearly 60 tons of yard 
debris a day from landfills. 
</P>
<P>
 The Simi Valley Recycling Center is open Monday through Saturday from 9 a.m. 
to 5 p.m. MARY F. POLS

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: MEETING ON QUAKE RELIEF FUNDS PLANNED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF McDONALD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A public hearing is scheduled this morning to gather input on how to spend 
$2.8 million in federal block grant money received by Ventura County following 
the Jan. 17 Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Scheduled for 10 a.m. in the Board of Supervisors chambers, the hearing will 
give people an opportunity to pitch various projects and programs that meet 
federal requirements. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisors already have a list of staff recommended allocations. 
</P>
<P>
 The recommendation made by Chief Administrative Officer Richard Wittenberg's 
office suggests the supervisors award more than $1.5 million to the Fillmore 
and Piru areas -- two of the county's most-damaged communities. 
</P>
<P>
 The federal Housing and Urban Development grant money would be used to 
rehabilitate homes and businesses that were damaged or destroyed by the 
earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Fillmore City Councilman Roger Campbell said the city could never had afforded 
the temporary buildings that now house several downtown merchants without the 
grants, which were promised earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been working very closely with the county and the secretary of Housing 
and Urban Development, knowing this was on its way," Campbell said.  
</P>
<P>
 The staff recommends that the bulk of the remaining money be spent on various 
projects in the unincorporated areas of Ventura County. The cities of Oxnard, 
Ventura and Moorpark would receive less than $100,000 combined. 
</P>
<P>
 The hearing today is the final chance for members of the public to comment on 
where the money should be spent. JEFF McDONALD

 A 42-year-old Simi Valley man died of traumatic head and chest injuries after 
a collision in which a pickup truck pulled out in front of his motorcycle, 
authorities said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Bruce Page was pronounced dead at Ventura County Medical Center at 9:58 p.m. 
Sunday, about 9 1/2 hours after the accident on California 126 in Fillmore, 
Deputy Coroner Mitch Breese said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's investigators on Monday said driver Ivan Campos, 18, of Fillmore, 
could be cited for vehicular manslaughter. The Ventura County district 
attorney's office will decide whether to prosecute Campos, Sheriff's Deputy 
Jerry Peterson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Campos was trying to turn left from Mountain View Street onto State 126 and 
crashed into Page, who was driving his Harley-Davidson motorcycle west at about 
45 m.p.h. Peterson said Page did not have time to brake. 
</P>
<P>
 Page flew over the truck hood and landed about 20 feet away, Peterson said. He 
was wearing a half-helmet at the time of the accident, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Page, who was a supervisor at the food manufacturer H.J. Heinz Co., is 
survived by his parents, wife, two sons and two daughters. PEGGY Y. LEE

 By next February, Ventura's Arroyo Verde Park may sport new barbecue grills, 
picnic benches and a children's play area if the City Council approves a plan 
to improve the park's north end. 
</P>
<P>
 The council on Monday approved a report showing that the proposed improvements 
will not have a significant negative impact on the environment. 
</P>
<P>
 City engineers say the project -- which will cost Ventura up to $300,000 -- 
will go out to bid sometime this summer. After bids are submitted, the council 
will take a final vote on the project. 
</P>
<P>
 The improvements will also include a horseshoe pit and a paved parking lot for 
up to 68 cars. 
</P>
<P>
 Arroyo Verde Park covers 130 acres and lies at the end of Day Road on 
Ventura's north side. The park already has barbecue and picnic facilities and 
children's areas on its south end. CONSTANCE SOMMER

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS : CAMARILLO; DEVELOPER, DISTRICT AGREE ON SCHOOL FEES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By J.E. MITCHELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An agreement between a Camarillo school district and a luxury-home developer 
over how much should be paid in developer's fees has cleared the way for the 
Camarillo Planning Commission to consider a proposal to build 89 single-family 
homes on the city's northwest side. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission, which first examined the proposal by the Spanish Hills 
Development Co. at its May 17 meeting, will hold a public hearing on the 
project at its meeting tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 At issue had been the amount of developer's fees that Spanish Hills would 
agree to pay to the Pleasant Valley School District to compensate for the 45 
extra students that the development is expected to generate. 
</P>
<P>
 Howard Hamilton, associate superintendent for the district, said the 
development company will pay the district $1.62 per square foot, or 
approximately $325,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are very pleased that we were able to reach an agreement with the 
developer," Hamilton said. "Throughout our meetings, both sides negotiated well 
and with respect for one another." 
</P>
<P>
 Under the state School Facilities Act, developers must pay school districts 
certain fees in compensation for the extra students that their developments 
bring. More fees can be negotiated if, as in this case, the developer is asking 
for a zoning change. 
</P>
<P>
 Spanish Hills officials are requesting that the 52-acre site be rezoned from 
its current rural zoning to that of a residential planned development. 
</P>
<P>
 Home sizes in the development would range between 1,900 and 2,500 square feet 
-- considerably smaller than homes in the nearby 430-acre Spanish Hills housing 
and golf-course development, where single-family homes are 3,500 square feet or 
larger. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the proposal requires a zoning change, the matter must go before the 
City Council for consideration if the Planning Commission gives its approval 
tonight. The commission will meet at 7:30 p.m. at City Hall, 601 Carmen Drive.

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS : OIL PLATFORMS ESCAPE EARTHQUAKE DAMAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Following weeks of extensive surveying, the federal Minerals Management 
Service has determined that none of the 12 oil platforms offshore of Ventura 
County sustained damage in the Jan. 17 Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency, which regulates oil production in federal waters, sent out a team 
of inspectors two days after the earthquake to survey a total of 24 platforms 
and their connecting sea-floor pipelines off the California coast. 
</P>
<P>
 "Based on our analysis, we are pleased to announce that platforms on the outer 
continental shelf withstood January's major earthquake," said MMS Director Tom 
Fry in a statement released late last week. 
</P>
<P>
 MMS officials said the only notable incident occurred on Platform Hogan off of 
Rincon Point, where a three-barrel oil spill was discovered. The spill, which 
was contained and cleaned up, occurred when an onshore facility connected to 
the platform by pipeline lost power.  
</P>
<P>
 Without electricity, the onshore facility allowed oil-fouled water back into a 
pipeline leading back to the platform. 
</P>
<P>
 Hogan is owned and operated by Pacific Operators Inc. according to MMS 
documents. J.E. MITCHELL

<P>
 In an effort to better inform residents about the city's new smoking 
ordinance, Camarillo officials said a brochure describing the law should begin 
arriving in mailboxes across the city beginning Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The new ordinance was adopted early last month, but the city waited until a 
threatened petition drive failed before preparing the mailer, according to City 
Manager Bill Little. 
</P>
<P>
 "We did not want to provide information to the public that would be out of 
date or completely irrelevant," Little said. "If the petitions had been 
successful, the ordinance would have been in abeyance for at least 30 days and 
possibly until November." 
</P>
<P>
 Little said the city will print and mail 22,500 of the brochures at an 
estimated cost of $4,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The new ordinance, which largely prohibits smoking in public places, went into 
effect May 27. Residents seeking more information on the ordinance may call 
(805) 388-5349. J.E. MITCHELL

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS : SANTA PAULA; WATER DISTRICT BUYS OLD BANK BUILDING 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The United Water Conservation District has purchased the former Security 
Pacific Bank building in Santa Paula and plans to relocate its headquarters 
there at the beginning of next year. 
</P>
<P>
 United recently purchased the 24,100-square-foot site at 737 E. Main St. for 
$350,000 after the merger between Security Pacific and Bank of America resulted 
in closure of the bank branch, a real estate official said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been looking for three years for a new facility," United General 
Manager Frederick J. Gientke said. "The district has never had a permanent 
home." 
</P>
<P>
 The district closed escrow on the structure two weeks ago, Gientke said, but 
doesn't plan to move in until later. He said the district is instead focusing 
on a project to prevent seawater intrusion. That project, designed to protect 
the drinking water in the Fox Canyon Aquifer, is expected to start in July. 
</P>
<P>
 United has leased office space near the former bank building for years, 
Gientke said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've had my eyes on it for a year and a half," he said. "I think it will give 
us a permanent United-owned main office at a considerable cost savings." 
</P>
<P>
 United manages all surface and ground-water resources in the 214,000-acre 
district and provides water to the cities of Oxnard and Port Hueneme and other 
customers. TRACY WILSON

SIMI BOARD TO DISCUSS UNIFORMS AT GARDEN GROVE ELEMENTARY; EDUCATION: THE 
PRINCIPAL SAYS THE OPTIONAL DRESS CODE OF NAVY AND WHITE WOULD PROMOTE SAFETY. 
ONE BOARD MEMBER CALLS IT A SUPERFICIAL REMEDY FOR CONFLICT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Children at Garden Grove Elementary in Simi Valley would become the first in 
Ventura County to wear uniforms on a public campus, under a proposal to be 
discussed by school officials tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan, backed by Principal Elroy Peterson, would strongly encourage, but 
not require, the school's approximately 500 students to wear a uniform of navy 
pants or skirts and white shirts and blouses. 
</P>
<P>
 Peterson said he suggested the idea to parents last fall as a way to eliminate 
competition over clothes and make students concentrate more on learning. He 
also said uniforms would prevent students from mimicking fashion styles 
associated with street gangs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're doing it because we want children to feel safe here and we want them to 
feel like this is a place where they come to do business, not play," Peterson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "All we want them to do is have an opportunity to enjoy school without 
worrying about the latest fad or getting beat up if they wear the wrong color," 
he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Peterson said 75% of parents who returned a survey in May supported his idea. 
Of 333 responses, 249 parents said they favored uniforms and 84 said they were 
opposed. 
</P>
<P>
 Another 18 said they wanted more information. About 500 students attend the 
school, including 125 who are physically or severely handicapped. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the Simi Valley Unified school board are expected to discuss 
Peterson's proposal tonight along with broader guidelines for allowing 
individual schools to develop their own dress codes. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Two of the five school board members on Monday expressed concerns about Garden 
Grove's proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 School board member Debbie Sandland said she fears that students who opt not 
to wear uniforms to Garden Grove will be pressured to conform or transfer out 
of the school. 
</P>
<P>
 Under Garden Grove's proposal, students not in uniform would have to adhere to 
a strict dress code. That, said Sandland, could amount to a "back-door uniform 
policy for all." 
</P>
<P>
 Sandland also criticized the idea as superficial, saying it avoids the 
underlying reasons for fights and other violence on campus.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's window dressing," she said. "If they're having trouble with conflict, we 
need to focus on that, not on making these kids look the same." 
</P>
<P>
 And school board member Doug Crosse questioned the results of Peterson's 
survey, asking whether a true majority really supports the idea. 
</P>
<P>
 The parents of incoming kindergartners were not polled, while the parents of 
graduating sixth-graders were. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, Crosse said, he is concerned that some families may have voted more than 
once. 
</P>
<P>
 "I support schools' desires to have dress codes and uniforms, if indeed they 
are getting a true representation of parents and students," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In response, Peterson said the school is sending home a second survey this 
week to the parents who did not respond to the earlier questionnaire. 
</P>
<P>
 Many parents who support dressing their kids in uniforms say the reasons are 
often more practical than philosophical.

 Laurie Wilkinson, who works as a campus aide and has a son in the fourth 
grade, said uniforms would save her family money and eliminate fights in the 
morning over acceptable dress for school. 
</P>
<P>
 "I truly believe it would be one less thing for the kids or the parents to 
worry about," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Garden Grove is the first school in Ventura County to seek approval 
for a uniform policy, other schools in Simi Valley and throughout the county 
have toughened their dress codes in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the restrictions have focused on gang attire, such as baggy pants, 
oversized jackets and baseball caps. 
</P>
<P>
 Still other schools have adopted strict policies as part of a back-to-basics 
movement focusing on discipline and academics. 
</P>
<P>
 At the suggestion of Supt. Joseph Spirito, the Ventura Unified School District 
began considering uniforms several months ago. And in Simi Valley, Vista 
Fundamental School bans jeans and shorts, except on designated days.

ROBERT D. HOYT, FORMER MAYOR OF ORANGE, DIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Robert Duncan Hoyt, who became the first mayor of Orange to be directly 
elected by voters in 1978, died of lung cancer Saturday at his home here. He 
was 71. 
</P>
<P>
 During his term as mayor, from 1976 to 1980, Hoyt oversaw the preservation of 
the historic Old Town section of the city and instituted the city's paramedic 
squad. 
</P>
<P>
 Born and raised in Orange, Hoyt graduated from Orange High School before 
joining the Navy in 1942 and fighting in the Pacific Theater.  
</P>
<P>
 After his return from the war, he co-founded the Orange Furniture Store in 
1947 and went on to become an officer of the First National Bank of Orange 
County. In 1982, he was the organizing president and CEO of California City 
Bank. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoyt was president of a number of civic organizations during his life, 
including the Orange Chamber of Commerce, the Orange Rotary Club, Orange 
Toastmasters Club and Community Bankers of Southern California. He also served 
on the boards of the Boy Scouts, the YMCA and the Rancho Santiago Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 Named Orange Citizen of the Year in 1974, Hoyt had an orange grove preserved 
in his name by the City Council when he left office in 1980. The grove, the 
Robert D. Hoyt Municipal Orange Grove, is in Hart Park. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was very proud of his Scottish heritage," said his wife, Jessie Hoyt. "He 
was proud of the fact that he was president of Community Bankers of Southern 
California, and he was proud of the fact that he was married to me for 50 
years." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to his wife, Hoyt is survived by a son, Douglas Hoyt of Indio, a 
daughter, Claudia Arms of Menifee, a brother, Richard Hoyt, and four 
grandchildren, Jennifer Hoyt, Rachael Arms, William Arms and Robert Arms. 
</P>
<P>
 Funeral services will be Friday at 11 a.m. at Waverley Church, 1702 E. 
Fairhaven Ave., Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 In lieu of flowers, the family asks that donations be made to VNA Hospice or 
Ronald McDonald House, both in Orange.

MOTHER PORTRAYED AS VICTIM, TORTURER AS CASE GOES TO JURY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DWAYNE BRAY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The child-abuse case of Charlotte Russo went to the jury Monday -- with her 
lawyer presenting her as the victim of a lying child and the prosecutor calling 
the Westlake woman a torturer. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorney James M. Farley said the girl's story of being locked in a 
back-yard racquetball court off and on for two years is untrue, and he denied 
the prosecutor's suggestion that the girl was treated like Cinderella. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cinderella had to sleep by the fire and ashes," Farley said. "But this isn't 
a Cinderella story. It's a Pinocchio story. And (the girl's) nose grows every 
time she comes up with another story." 
</P>
<P>
 But Deputy Dist. Atty. Dee Corona described Russo as mean-spirited, saying she 
put her daughter's life in danger by physically abusing her. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's clear the Russo family had a dirty little secret, and the secret was 
(their daughter) who lived in the racquetball court," said Corona, telling the 
jury that "Mrs. Russo is guilty of abusing her child in every possible way." 
</P>
<P>
 During the arguments from both sides, Russo kept a stern look on her face and 
diligently took notes on a legal pad. She faces up to three years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 From the beginning, Corona acknowledged that the girl presented problems for 
Russo. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to be the first to tell you that (the girl) was no angel and was no 
saint," Corona said, adding later, "she was flamboyant. She was stubborn. She 
liked to dance around in front of company." 
</P>
<P>
 But those were not reasons for her to be mistreated, Corona said. 
</P>
<P>
 In deciding the case, jurors must determine which witnesses were the most 
credible -- the prosecution's or the defense's, Corona said. 
</P>
<P>
 And she said that choice should be clear. Russo and her other children 
consistently lied during the trial, Corona said. Russo's husband, Richard, did 
not testify, but pleaded guilty to misdemeanor child abuse and served 30 days 
in jail. 
</P>
<P>
 Corona pointed out what she saw as the major inconsistencies. 
</P>
<P>
 The girl said her mother pinched her. Her mother said that was a lie. The girl 
said her mother tied a rope around her wrists and dragged her around the family 
garage, a charge the mother denied. 
</P>
<P>
 The girl said her mother scratched her in the face. The mother said she didn't 
do it. The girl said she was forced to eat oatmeal mixed with tap water and raw 
eggs. The mother denied that, too. 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecutor also said that defense witnesses had a reason to lie on the 
stand: They don't want to see Russo convicted and possibly imprisoned. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have some big whoppers in this case," Corona said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, she said the girl was forced to sleep in the back-yard 
racquetball court off and on for nearly two years. "But what do we have in 
court?" she asked. "We have the whole family coming in and saying that's not 
true." 
</P>
<P>
 She also said that Russo and other family members fabricated a story about the 
girl attacking her mother on May 23, 1993 -- the day before Russo's arrest on 
child-abuse charges. According to defense testimony, Russo bit the girl in 
self-defense that day to stave off the attack. 
</P>
<P>
 Corona said the story of the attack was invented because prosecutors proved 
Russo's teeth marks were on the girl's body. "Self-defense. That's a good 
story," Corona remarked, sarcastically. 
</P>
<P>
 Corona said Russo actually bit the girl in the family's garage during an 
unprovoked attack on her daughter only hours before her arrest. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mrs. Russo was completely out of control the night of May 24," she said. "She 
tore at (the girl) with her teeth." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But Farley said Russo never struck or bit the girl in the garage. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know why there was no bruising on (the girl) in the garage?" asked 
Farley, showing the jury pictures taking that night. "Because she wasn't hit. 
She wasn't punched. She wasn't kicked." 
</P>
<P>
 Farley belittled the prosecution's theory that Russo is a "wicked mother" and 
her daughter was the family's "scullery maid." 
</P>
<P>
 He noted that Russo always took the girl to doctor appointments and checked 
with physicians to make sure it was all right to require the girl to ride her 
bike to summer school.  
</P>
<P>
 He also noted that the girl had her own bedroom and attended private schools. 
When the girl would run away, Farley said, the family would go out and look for 
her. 
</P>
<P>
 "Did they look for her because they were concerned for this kid, or did they 
look for her because they loved her?" Farley asked. "Charlotte said she loved 
her. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why was she sent to private schools if she was the black sheep of the 
family?" Farley asked. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the girl's problems were of her own doing. 
</P>
<P>
 He said she didn't do her homework and threw away her tests instead of 
bringing them home for her mother to review. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 He appealed to the jury to empathize with the pain and suffering that Russo 
has endured. 
</P>
<P>
 "You who are parents," he said to the jury, "you've got to understand what it 
means when a child you've done everything for turns on you and accuses you." 
</P>
<P>
 He also defended Richard Russo and the other Russo children for assisting with 
Charlotte Russo's defense. 
</P>
<P>
 "Charlotte Russo may have been a strict disciplinarian," he said. "But is she 
a mean witch? Is she the wicked stepmother from the East? No." 
</P>
<P>
 The entire trial could have been avoided, Farley said, if the girl had 
followed directions. 
</P>
<P>
 "None of this would have happened if (the girl) would have just done her 
homework, did what the other kids did and looked after herself by watching what 
she ate," Farley said. 
</P>
<P>
 The jury will begin deliberating Wednesday.

KILLINGS AT SAN MARINO PARTY BLAMED ON GANGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VICKI TORRES and KENNETH REICH, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The attack that left two teen-agers dead at a million-dollar San Marino home 
resulted from a dispute that brewed after members of several gangs from 
throughout Los Angeles showed up at a weekend party, according to police and 
sheriff's sources. 
</P>
<P>
 Some gang members were ordered to leave the party but returned to spray the 
back yard and a family room with bullets from semiautomatic weapons, forcing 
the trapped victims to desperately scramble behind furniture for cover, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators said that uninvited gang members began showing up at 11:30 p.m. 
Saturday, when the party was winding down. Although the host wanted the party 
to end, he was intimidated by the late arrivals and the party continued, amid 
arguments and growing tension. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, the late arrivals were told to leave. They returned shortly after 
and were confronted by two youths hired to provide security. The youths fled 
around the side of the house, yelling, "Run, run, run," when two Filipino gang 
members pulled out guns and began chasing them, said sheriff's homicide 
Detective Joseph Raffa. 
</P>
<P>
 San Marino Police Chief Frank Wills said he was confident that arrests would 
be made quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're focusing on identifying the suspects right now," Wills said. "Once we 
do, the hard part will be over." 
</P>
<P>
 But, he said, police believe that party-goers who know those responsible for 
the shooting fear retribution if they provide investigators with the names. He 
said he was confident that the shooters were not from San Marino. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know there are some people who attended the party who knew who the 
intruders were and are not telling us," Wills said. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County sheriff's spokesman Capt. Dan Burt, however, said it was 
too early in the investigation to say how quickly it might produce results. 
"It's still the bread-and-butter investigation," he said. "Homicide is making a 
number of calls we didn't have a chance to make yesterday." 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators also are looking for three getaway cars used by the eight to 12 
gang members who police say were involved in the attack. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the cars, a four-door, light-colored 1990 or 1991 Honda Civic DX, was 
broadsided by one of the party-goers fleeing the scene. Another, a white 
mid-1980s Mitsubishi, may have been stopped by Alhambra police shortly after 
the 1 a.m. Sunday shooting. But the vehicle, which carried four young people, 
was released after officers were told by San Marino police that they were not 
looking for a Mitsubishi, Alhambra police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Wills and city and school officials conducted a question-and-answer 
session Monday night for about 200 residents to reassure them that the incident 
was sparked by outsiders and that the dignified calm that characterizes the 
wealthy enclave had been shaken but not shattered. 
</P>
<P>
 Once the exclusive realm of old money moguls who profited from Southern 
California's growth, San Marino has become far more diverse. Asian American 
immigrants now make up nearly a third of the population of 13,000 and 60% of 
the students in the highly regarded school district. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody has a family, a station wagon and a dog, and they give schools and 
safety a top priority," said San Marino Mayor Bernard Le Sage. "That is what 
San Marino is about and it remains that." 
</P>
<P>
 He said "our sympathy and prayers go out to the victims, but we are going to 
try to work on solutions." 
</P>
<P>
 He called for a hot line to be established to allow students or their parents 
to anonymously report to police any gang activity, drug sales or weapons on 
school campuses. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kids have to be kids and have parties and have fun," he said. "It's a 
question of what type of party and if there is anything we can do to make them 
safer." 
</P>
<P>
 One party-goer, who asked not to be identified, said the incident has made San 
Marino youths decide not to hold any more "flyer parties," called that because 
they are announced by flyers sent out and posted throughout the area. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents who attended the meeting asked whether the city could adopt a curfew 
for youths, have police monitor large parties more closely or take other steps 
to prevent similar shootings. A few said that some San Marino young people are 
involved in gangs and drugs and that leaders had been too quick to put all the 
blame for the incident on outsiders. 
</P>
<P>
 The poolside party was held at a house on Lombardy Place by San Marino High 
School senior Frank Chen. It started out quietly even though gang members were 
among the invited guests, according to one police source. Officers said they 
had been alerted in advance by the host's parents that no beer or other alcohol 
would be provided and that older youths would keep an eye on the festivities. 
</P>
<P>
 Brian Tong, 18, and his brother had been hired as disc jockeys to provide 
entertainment. They, in turn, had hired 18-year-old Dennis Buan, a senior at 
South Pasadena High School, and his brother, Luigi, to help out, police said. 
Apparently aware of the possibility of violence, the disc jockeys brought along 
a hand-held metal detector to find weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 The party was nearly over when the shooting began. 
</P>
<P>
 As the shooters, possibly one male and one female, ran into the back yard and 
opened fire, a few party-goers were still in the yard and dashed inside. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a lot of panic inside the house," Raffa said. 
</P>
<P>
 Buan was hit by gunfire and died at a local hospital. David Heng, 15, a 
ninth-grader at San Marino High School, died near the back door. Oliver Chu, 
18, who also was helping with security at the party, was in serious condition 
Sunday at Huntington Hospital in Pasadena, but hospital officials would not 
provide any information on his condition Monday. Six others, two of them San 
Marino High graduates, were injured. 
</P>
<P>
 One of those hit by gunfire was the older brother of the party host. 
</P>
<P>
 Both San Marino and South Pasadena high schools arranged for counselors to be 
available to talk to grieving students this week.

17 ARRESTS MADE IN BOOKMAKING RAIDS; CRIME: SHERIFF'S DEPUTIES SIMULTANEOUSLY 
HIT SITES IN FIVE COUNTIES. AUTHORITIES SAY THEY HAVE CRIPPLED -- FOR NOW -- A 
SPORTS GAMBLING RING NETTING $5 MILLION A MONTH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Southern California's largest illegal sports bookmaking operation was crippled 
Monday when sheriff's deputies swept through five counties and arrested 17 
people, including a man believed to be the leader of the enterprise, which 
netted $5 million a month, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 About 100 deputies fanned out through Los Angeles, Riverside, San Bernardino, 
Ventura and Orange counties and made all of the arrests at 7 a.m., according to 
the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. Authorities said they wanted to 
stop the ring before the next wave of illegal betting, expected to hit when the 
National Basketball Assn. finals begin Wednesday. One suspect was still at 
large at day's end, however. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was the biggest bookmaking organization for sports betting in Southern 
California," said Lt. David Kading of the vice detail of the sheriff's Special 
Investigations Bureau. "Hopefully, we have put them out of business for a short 
period of time, until they bail themselves out." 
</P>
<P>
 Bettors found out about the widespread operation by word of mouth, and it was 
so sophisticated that regular customers used special identification codes. But 
for those owed money from recently placed bets, authorities said, all bets are 
off. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those arrested Monday were Kale Kalustian, 65, of Granada Hills, the 
alleged head of the ring; and two top aides, Walter Miller, 45, also of Granada 
Hills, and Ron LaForgia, 65, of Thousand Oaks, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Kading said illegal bookmaking is so rampant that authorities hold out 
little hope the operation will remain dormant for long. 
</P>
<P>
 Kalustian and some of his alleged associates had been arrested at least once 
before, in 1986, on suspicion of masterminding a similar, though smaller, ring. 
Authorities allege that this time, Kalustian had taken over at least some of 
the control of a massive illegal operation from Ron Sacco, a California-based 
bookmaker believed to have run the largest sports betting scheme in the world 
until his indictment last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kalustian had been an associate of Sacco for years, and when the Sacco 
organization was somewhat dismantled, Kalustian flowed in and filled the void," 
Kading said. "If (Kalustian) goes to prison along with his top lieutenants, 
someone else will flow in and fill the void. That is the nature of the game." 
</P>
<P>
 All 17 people arrested were booked for investigation of conspiracy to commit 
bookmaking and were being held in lieu of $200,000 bail each. Arraignments had 
not been scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
 The investigation into the current ring began nine months ago, and there had 
been more than a dozen arrests before Monday. Kading said that the ring 
specialized in taking bets for professional and college basketball and football 
games, as well as betting at major horse racing tracks, and that clerks took 
the bets at a variety of locales and phone numbers in order to thwart 
authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 At least part of the operation was believed to be run by Kalustian out of his 
Granada Hills home, where the alleged kingpin was believed to be making the 
lion's share of the profits, Kading said. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, authorities seized $82,408 in cash from five locations, including 
$34,099 from Kalustian and $29,791 from Miller. Also seized and displayed at a 
news conference Monday afternoon were computers, financial ledgers, cellular 
and regular phones and tape recorders used to record the bets and transactions. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides Kalustian and his alleged lieutenants, the 14 other suspects arrested 
Monday were clerks who were paid between $200 and $300 a week, in cash, to take 
bets over the phone, authorities said. They were arrested at their homes in 
Quartz Hill, Bellflower, Sherman Oaks, Westlake, Century City, Pico Rivera, Los 
Angeles, Diamond Bar, Ontario, Duarte, Whittier, San Pedro, Rancho Mirage in 
Riverside County and Los Alamitos in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities described the raids as a major success, given the elusive nature 
of sports betting operations. Such rings spread their operations over a vast 
region so some associates will have time to escape and destroy evidence even as 
others are being arrested. But in this case, using a battle plan several 
hundred pages long, authorities coordinated the raids in secrecy and made the 
arrests at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 By late afternoon, only suspected clerk Robert Tondreau was still at large, 
and authorities said they had seized $2,000 in cash from his San Pedro home. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities conceded, however that they believed others were involved. They 
said they decided to concentrate on 18 key people because the Sheriff's 
Department vice unit has a relatively small staff. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the clerks had been arrested recently, but had gone right back to work 
after their release, Kading said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kalustian was charged along with 11 others -- including LaForgia -- in 1986 
with running what authorities at the time said was the largest gambling ring of 
its kind in Southern California. That operation took in more than $30 million a 
year in wagers, turning a net annual profit of $4 million to $6 million, 
according to authorities. The results of that case were not immediately 
available because the records are not in the Los Angeles County district 
attorney's office's computers, a spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kalustian's current operation was much larger and more sophisticated, 
according to Kading, similar in scope to the one allegedly run by Sacco. 
</P>
<P>
 Sacco was indicted last August along with 25 suspected aides after a five-year 
federal, state and local investigation. He was charged with running a 
$1-billion-a-year sports bookmaking ring. A judge in Northern California 
revoked Sacco's bail recently after authorities said he had resumed bookmaking. 
Sacco is in federal custody awaiting trial. 
</P>
<P>
 After law enforcement began investigating his operation, authorities believe 
Sacco moved it to the Dominican Republic, where he took calls over toll-free 
phone lines, authorities said.

POLICE, CITY TO USE MEDIATOR IN NEGOTIATIONS; LABOR: FRIDAY IS SET AS TARGET 
FOR ACCORD. UNION AGREES TO SUSPEND JOB ACTIONS AND NOT TO GATHER INFORMATION 
ON COUNCIL MEMBERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In what is considered a major breakthrough in the stalled labor negotiations 
between Los Angeles police and the city, both sides agreed Monday to bring a 
mediator into the talks and to set Friday as the target date for reaching a 
contract agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 Union officials said the agreement Monday would mean a suspension of any job 
actions by police officers, such as the "blue flu" sickout last week that 
disrupted staffing throughout the city and that officers threatened to repeat 
during the upcoming World Cup soccer matches. 
</P>
<P>
 Also to be eliminated, the union said, is the "information gathering" on City 
Council members that was threatened late last week by union officials. City 
Council members likened the threat to blackmail and a number of civil rights 
organizations joined forces Monday to denounce it. 
</P>
<P>
 The compromise, reached shortly before 5 p.m. Monday, came as the city said it 
was about to declare an impasse in the talks. The police union reversed its 
position and agreed to the mediator late in the day, only a few minutes before 
Mayor Richard Riordan was to read a statement declaring the talks deadlocked. 
</P>
<P>
 As a concession to the union, the mediator will be called a "neutral third 
party settlement adviser." 
</P>
<P>
 The union's acceptance of a mediator was seen as an important step in the 
stalled talks, coming just days after union leaders rejected a similar offer. 
The union had said previously that it would agree only to binding arbitration, 
not a mediator or settlement judge who would not have the legal power to 
resolve the matter. 
</P>
<P>
 Danny Staggs, president of the Police Protective League, said in a prepared 
statement that an impasse would have been counterproductive for both sides. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have agreed that both parties will be committed to the outcome," he said. 
"I believe negotiating is a form of give and take. I believe the City Council 
and the mayor took a step forward by saying they would be committed to it." 
</P>
<P>
 Monday had its share of drama, as the negotiations reached critical points at 
which they could have broken down. The city was prepared to declare an impasse 
at 10 a.m. That decision was then put off until 2 p.m. Finally, at 4:55 p.m., 
five minutes before the city was to announce the deadlock, the union agreed to 
accept a mediator. 
</P>
<P>
 In the course of Monday's negotiations, the union demanded that the city meet 
11 conditions before a mediator was accepted. These ranged from amnesty for 
those who participated in the sickout to confidentiality for all future 
negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 But the city would agree to only two of the demands -- that the talks be held 
at a neutral site and that they remain confidential. The city also insisted 
that the union denounce any protests by officers that target City Council 
members. 
</P>
<P>
 The mediator will be chosen jointly. Staggs said he expected that an agreement 
on a new contract could be reached by the Friday target date, presuming both 
sides quickly agree on the settlement adviser. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're looking for people who have experience in that field," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier in the day, a coalition of civil rights groups, led by the Southern 
Christian Leadership Conference, directed highly critical remarks toward the 
police union negotiators, characterizing their threat to dig up dirt on City 
Council members as "strong-arm tactics." 
</P>
<P>
 In reply, union spokesman Geoffrey Garfield said the threat to release 
embarrassing information about council members was nothing more than 
"opposition research" designed to push forward the negotiations that have been 
stalled for two years. 
</P>
<P>
 The group of seven civil rights representatives said they were troubled by the 
threats, which included the suggestion that the police might picket council 
members' homes and purchase billboard space to draw attention to the protracted 
negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 The concern about the gathering of embarrassing information on council members 
was reflected in Riordan's prepared statement of impasse -- one he did not 
issue -- in which he referred to "unprecedented threats made by league board 
members against the mayor and individual members of the city council and their 
personal privacy."

ETHICS PANEL FINDS NO EVIDENCE OF SVORINICH CAMPAIGN VIOLATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG KRIKORIAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Four months after allegations of misconduct were first leveled, the Los 
Angeles City Ethics Commission concluded Monday that there was no evidence -- 
or way to prove accusations -- that Councilman Rudy Svorinich Jr. violated 
campaign finance laws or engaged in other improprieties as an officeholder. 
</P>
<P>
 In a 36-page report, the commission's staff did find that campaign 
contributions were twice delivered to Svorinich's San Pedro office late last 
year despite a city ban on such activities. As a result, the commission said, 
Svorinich and his staff should receive more training in laws covering campaign 
finance and ethics. 
</P>
<P>
 While the Los Angeles County district attorney is reportedly continuing a 
separate investigation into Svorinich and his office, the Ethics Commission's 
report was hailed by the freshman councilman as a vindication of his conduct. 
</P>
<P>
 "It confirms what I said all along. I have never violated any laws," Svorinich 
said. "I was a victim of false and malicious accusations -- by disgruntled 
ex-employees -- that were totally unfounded." 
</P>
<P>
 Svorinich's praise for the report was countered by criticism of it among some 
former aides to the councilman who were the first to raise allegations of 
impropriety. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is exactly what I would expect from the Ethics Commission because they are 
simply incapable of independently reviewing one of their own," said former 
Svorinich aide John Barbieri. 
</P>
<P>
 John Vidovich, Svorinich's onetime chief deputy, noting that both he and his 
fiance resigned from the council office, said, "The two of us had a combined 
salary of $105,000 a year and we are still unemployed. Do you think we would 
have left that if something wasn't wrong?" 
</P>
<P>
 Ethics Commission officials refused to respond to the criticism and Svorinich 
described it as "sour grapes." 
</P>
<P>
 Barbieri and Vidovich are among six former Svorinich aides who were fired or 
resigned from his office in late January. After the exodus, the former 
employees raised a host of allegations of misconduct, including unreported 
campaign contributions to Svorinich and an aide doing work for Svorinich's 
Wilmington paint store on city time. 
</P>
<P>
 But in reviewing the accusations, the commission found either no documentary 
proof of wrongdoing or only one witness to any single claim of improprieties by 
Svorinich or aides. 
</P>
<P>
 In the case of Svorinich's onetime support for a controversial waterfront 
project, the commission found no evidence that the councilman backed the 
multimillion-dollar development because of contributions from one of its 
principals, Union Pacific Resources Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 It noted that Svorinich later withdrew his support for the project. 
</P>
<P>
 Likewise, the commission said it found no record or corroboration of 
accusations that Svorinich or his staff used city time or equipment for 
political and private work. 
</P>
<P>
 Only in one case did the commission substantiate any accusations against 
Svorinich's office. The investigation found that contributions were received at 
the councilman's San Pedro office on Nov. 29 and Dec. 8, but no proof existed 
that Svorinich knew of the activity.

JUDGE SAYS DISTRICT MUST ADMINISTER CLAS TESTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHARON MOESER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Los Angeles Superior Court judge ruled Monday that state law requires school 
districts to administer the controversial CLAS tests, which have been praised 
by some as a revolutionary measure of critical thinking skills and blasted by 
others as intrusive and secretive. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Diane Wayne's decision came after the state sought a court order against 
the Antelope Valley Union High School District. A conservative bloc on the 
district's board had refused to give the California Learning Assessment System 
tests to students. 
</P>
<P>
 "By refusing to administer the test (the board has) clearly violated its 
obligations under the Education Code. . . ," Wayne wrote in her four-page 
decision to grant the order. 
</P>
<P>
 Six of the 1,006 school districts in the state have opted not to give the 1994 
CLAS tests. Antelope Valley is the first district the state has taken to court. 
</P>
<P>
 While agreeing that the law requires a statewide assessment test to be given 
annually, the Antelope Valley critics of the exam had said the Education Code 
does not require it to be the CLAS test, which is being given this year to more 
than 1 million fourth, fifth, eighth and 10th-grade students. 
</P>
<P>
 Billy Pricer, president of the Antelope Valley school board, said he was 
unsure how the district would respond, but noted that an appeal could stall the 
tests until after school ends June 15. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything is resting on how the judge actually words the order and what 
we're ordered to do," Pricer said. "Right now it's a waiting game until we get 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 "Personally, I'd like to see us appeal," said board member Sue Stokka, who 
voted with Pricer and member Tony Welch in the board's April 20 decision to not 
administer CLAS. Monday's ruling "doesn't change my opinion one iota about my 
concerns about the test." 
</P>
<P>
 Opposition to the CLAS tests has been spearheaded by conservative Christian 
churches and a Virginia group that serves as an advocate for churches. Pricer 
is the former assistant pastor of the Springs of Life Ministries in Lancaster, 
an activist church known for distributing a video critical of gay lifestyles. 
</P>
<P>
 The school district argued unsuccessfully that the state Department of 
Education failed to adopt required rules and regulations for the administration 
of CLAS. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are no regulations in the state of California requiring testing at the 
10th-grade level," said Frank J. Fekete, the district's attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 Wayne disagreed, saying such regulations are in place and are sufficient. She 
also rejected the argument that the Antelope Valley position was an issue of 
local control, citing a legal decision that said regulation and operation of 
public schools are statewide functions as outlined in the Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
 State Department of Education officials said they were pleased with Monday's 
ruling. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have now a chance to go forward," said William D. Dawson, acting state 
superintendent of public instruction, who attended the hearing. "My interest is 
primarily in getting on with the job of improving the CLAS tests for the 
future." 
</P>
<P>
 The state Senate last week approved legislation that would reauthorize the 
tests for five more years and would impose several reforms designed to improve 
public confidence in the exams. The measure will next be heard in the Assembly.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; EX-DOCTOR 
GETS 13 YEARS FOR SEX ASSAULTS ON 4 PATIENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A former Brentwood doctor was sentenced to 13 years in prison Monday for 
sexually assaulting four female patients, including two who were patients at a 
Panorama City clinic. 
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court Judge Charles Horan imposed the sentence on Yahya Lavi, 56, 
during a hearing in Downtown Los Angeles, despite pleas by prosecutors to 
impose a 37-year prison term. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Beatriz Donoghue, who described Lavi's actions as 
"reprehensible" and "predatory," said she was satisfied with the sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 A jury convicted Lavi, a decertified orthopedic surgeon, in April of 10 felony 
and criminal counts of sexual battery and rape, and penetration with a foreign 
object when the victim was unconscious.  
</P>
<P>
 Audrey Winograde, an attorney representing Lavi, said her client maintains his 
innocence.

initiatives. Here are some facts and figures to remember about going to the 
polls: 
</P>
<P>
 * Polling places: Your sample ballot should tell you where to vote.If you need 
to find out where your polling place is located, or have other voting 
questions, call the county registrar at one of the numbers listed here. One of 
the easiest ways  
</P>
<P>
 to find out where your polling place is is to ask a neighbor. Polling places 
are marked with flags. 
</P>
<P>
 * Voter information numbers: Although registrars will have additional phone 
lines set up for Election Day, numbers are frequently busy, so be patient and 
leave yourself plenty of time. 
</P>
<P>
 * Los Angeles: (310) 462-2748 or (800) 830-1000 from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. today 
only 
</P>
<P>
 * Orange: (714) 567-7600  
</P>
<P>
 * San Diego: (619) 694-3400  
</P>
<P>
 * Ventura: (805) 654-2781  
</P>
<P>
 * Riverside: (909) 275-8700  
</P>
<P>
 * San Bernardino: (909) 387-8300  
</P>
<P>
 The secretary of state has a 24-hour voter information hot line, (800) 
345-VOTE. The Los Angeles County registrar's 24-hour voter line is (800) 
481-VOTE. 
</P>
<P>
 * Hours of voting; Statewide hours are 7 a.m. to 8 p.m.  
</P>
<P>
 * Violations: Report violations to the county registrar or the secretary of 
state's office. Examples of violations include voting twice, voting as someone 
else, soliciting or purchasing votes near polling areas, or offering anything 
of value for voting, such as giveaways and contests based on voted ballot 
stubs. 
</P>
<P>
 * The next election: For future elections, voter registration forms are 
generally available at post offices, libraries, fire stations, DMV offices, 
city halls and county offices. Deadline to register for the Nov. 8 election is 
Oct. 11. You should re-register if you move, change your name or want to change 
your party affiliation.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: GARDENA; LOST SOUTH 
KOREAN TOURIST SURFACES AFTER 3 WEEKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A South Korean tourist who disappeared from Gardena May 12 told police Monday 
he got lost on a walk and spent three weeks sleeping near a golf course and 
living on cupcakes and milk.  
</P>
<P>
 Young Moon Kim, 46, said he had simply lost his way and had been hoping that 
friends would find him. 
</P>
<P>
 Kim, who speaks no English and was carrying no identification, left his 
Gardena apartment May 12 to take a walk. He said he became lost after about 15 
minutes, eventually reaching the Chester Washington Golf Course. He told police 
he decided to stay in the golf course area until someone found him. It was not 
clear where he got the cupcakes and milk.  
</P>
<P>
 Police said Kim slept in the open. He tried for several days to recall the 
phone number of a friend, B.F. Choy, but did not put together the right 
combination of numbers until Sunday morning. Evidently embarrassed by his 
ordeal, Kim cut his trip short and flew back to South Korea on Monday night to 
be with his wife and family, police said.

TEST FAILURE WON'T INTERRUPT QUAKE RETROFITTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HUGO MARTIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Despite the testing failure of quake repair methods for steel-frame buildings, 
Los Angeles officials said they will continue with the same retrofitting 
program while researchers conduct further tests throughout the summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Preliminary testing at the University of Texas at Austin found that the repair 
methods recommended by the Los Angeles Department of Building and Safety failed 
when subjected to a simulated earthquake of 7.0 magnitude. 
</P>
<P>
 Researchers and city officials stressed Monday that additional tests were 
needed to determine what other repair methods would prevent the widespread 
cracking of streel-frame commercial buildings like that resulting from the 
Northridge quake. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've identified the virus, and now we need to find a vaccine," said Geerhard 
Haaijer, vice president of the American Institute of Steel Construction in 
Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 The results of the preliminary tests caused researchers to suspend five 
remaining simulations and bring their results to Los Angeles, where they met 
with city officials at a steel industry symposium near Los Angeles 
International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 But after the meeting, city officials said they would not immediately abandon 
the methods that have been recommended for both new construction and the repair 
of quake-damaged steel-frame buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is still too early to tell on this," said Richard Holguin, assistant chief 
of the city's building bureau. "There are still lots of tests to be run." 
</P>
<P>
 If the tests are accurate, Holguin said, the "repairs that are being 
recommended do not appear to provide a permanent correction." 
</P>
<P>
 Geoff Ely, executive director of the Building Owners and Managers Assn., 
representing about 1,500 members throughout Los Angeles County, called a Times 
report Monday of the tests "disturbing." But Ely said he cannot gauge the 
impact to building owners until more information about the tests is released.  
</P>
<P>
 Additional information on the tests is expected to be released today during a 
symposium of the American Institute of Steel Construction at the Airport 
Marriott Hotel. Among the speakers will be University of Texas professor 
Michael Engelhardt, who told The Times last weekend that the tests showed that 
the current retrofitting methods do not work. "Even with the improvements, 
there were cracks early on in the tests," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Steel-frame office buildings, designed to bend with the forces of an 
earthquake, were considered among the safest in riding out a temblor. But after 
the Northridge quake, building experts were shocked to find cracking on welded 
connections of beams and columns of at least 90 buildings, mostly in the San 
Fernando Valley and on the Westside. 
</P>
<P>
 Results of the Texas study -- the main effort to find a solution to the 
problem -- disturb experts because the welding methods and design changes 
tested are currently being used to make repairs to quake-damaged high-rises and 
in new construction. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles City Council voted in May to draft an ordinance that would 
require the owners of steel-frame buildings to inspect the buildings for damage 
within three months of notification by the city. Repairs, using the methods 
questioned by the Texas tests, would have to be completed within one year after 
they are recommended by inspectors, under the proposed ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilfred Iwan, chairman of the California Seismic Safety Commission, said he 
had not received any information on the Texas tests and is eager to have more 
information so the commission can complete a set of changes to the state's 
building codes requested by Gov. Pete Wilson after the Jan. 17 quake. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's important for that report to get out," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 When Iwan read The Times' report on the tests Monday, he said many questions 
came to his mind about how the tests were conducted and what recommendations 
will be made as a result. 
</P>
<P>
 "Clearly there is a potential for a huge problem," he said. "What it may be 
saying is you have to be careful of quick solutions." 
</P>
<P>
 The Texas test used life-sized columns and horizontal beams that were welded 
together in California and shipped to the University of Texas, where a 
hydraulic arm was used to shake the beam, simulating a quake. 
</P>
<P>
 After the steel frames were strengthened with plates and welds, some 
connections nonetheless broke when the beams were shaken up and down just once. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's repair recommendations to the owners of steel-frame buildings were 
based on engineering simulations conducted before the temblor. These showed 
that joints reinforced in certain ways, usually with steel plates, performed 
better than those built to the current code. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said owners of about 30 steel-frame buildings have taken out 
permits to make repairs, and about half of the repairs have been completed. 
</P>
<P>
 Ely, of the building owners group, could not say how many steel-frame 
buildings have begun to receive the repair work recommended by the city.

COUNTY FACED WITH A SWARM OF BUDGET PLEAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FREDERICK M. MUIR, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's Day 4 of the county budget hearings. 
</P>
<P>
 And just when you think you've heard every appeal from a parade of bureaucrats 
seeking bigger slices of the budget, a soft-spoken man in a conservative blue 
suit invokes a horrifying specter: killer bees. 
</P>
<P>
 They're coming. 
</P>
<P>
 And for the small, additional budget allocation of just $267,000 to pay for 
seven workers and a new pickup truck, Agricultural Commissioner Leon Spaugy 
told the Board of Supervisors, he will make sure the county is well prepared 
for the invasion. 
</P>
<P>
 The mean-spirited insects have already been spotted in Yuma, Ariz. -- just 
"one mile from the California border," Spaugy reported. And given their 
historical migration pace of 100 to 300 miles a year, the Africanized honey 
bees could be on the outskirts of Pomona by next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Spaugy said the funds are necessary to continue a public education campaign 
aimed at limiting attacks by the aggressive hybrid bees and coordinating county 
personnel who will have to deal with bee swarms or their victims. 
</P>
<P>
 Though his report conjured up images from low-budget horror films, the 
supervisors took it all in stride. And, several of the supervisors said after 
the meeting, Spaugy will probably get the additional funds. 
</P>
<P>
 His plea was just one of hundreds that the supervisors have heard in the 
annual budget hearings, which are expected to wrap up today. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the eclectic crowd appealing for more money Monday were AIDS activists, 
union officials concerned about layoffs, disabled people seeking to preserve 
in-home support services, community youth and gang services coordinators and 
school officials asking that crossing guards not be cut from the $14.7-billion 
annual county budget. 
</P>
<P>
 Already the supervisors have heard from representatives of the sheriff's and 
fire departments, and of the court, public health, mental health, parks, 
library and myriad other agencies that provide county services. 
</P>
<P>
 Each of the supervisors, as he or she listens to the appeals, is compiling a 
list of services that deserve more money than was set aside in the proposed 
budget. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Gloria Molina wants more funds for parks, libraries, children's 
services and welfare. Supervisor Ed Edelman is concerned about cuts in the 
assessor's office, Probation Department and mental health. Supervisor Mike 
Antonovich has public safety agencies, such as the sheriff's and district 
attorney's offices, at the top of his list, as well as museums, libraries and 
parks. 
</P>
<P>
 All of the pleading may be for naught. 
</P>
<P>
 The county budget is precariously balanced on some iffy revenue sources that 
will almost certainly grow even more unlikely this month. 
</P>
<P>
 That would mean more cuts than additions. 
</P>
<P>
 Many department heads are willing to take their lumps. 
</P>
<P>
 Spaugy, for instance, has lost several million dollars from his budget over 
the past several years. This year he is scheduled to lose 18 workers to budget 
cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 But, with these recent cuts, Spaugy told the supervisors Monday, "I've got no 
capacity to meet this new threat." Thus, he made his appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 "This year may well be the last time we have to prepare for the invasion of 
these pests," Spaugy said. "We can't stop them from coming, but we can minimize 
stinging incidents."

VANCOUVER HOPES BURE CAN STICK TO SCORING; HOCKEY: KEEPING STAR WINGER'S TEMPER 
IN CHECK COULD BE KEY TO STANLEY CUP FOR CANUCKS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HELENE ELLIOTT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Pavel Bure, whose fair coloring and angelic look make him resemble actor 
Macaulay Culkin, wore an un-angelic pout Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Vancouver Canuck right wing didn't like being asked whether he has been 
frustrated during the Stanley Cup finals, and whether that frustration led to 
the high-sticking penalty that got him ejected early from Game 3. 
</P>
<P>
 "What would you expect from me?" he asked. "To do highlights every game?" 
</P>
<P>
 Well, yes. 
</P>
<P>
 Bure became a human highlight film in the first three rounds of the playoffs, 
igniting a comeback from a 3-1 deficit against Calgary and leading the Canucks 
to the finals for the first time since 1982. Shut out in the first two games 
against the New York Rangers, he broke through for a spectacular goal 1:03 into 
Saturday's game, only to get thrown out at 18:21 for high-sticking defenseman 
Jay Wells, cutting Wells and breaking his nose. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, that is Bure's main impact on this series. And if he continues to use 
his stick as a rake instead of the magic wand that produced a league-leading 60 
goals, he might become the Marty McSorley of this year's finals. 
</P>
<P>
 Last June, McSorley's illegally curved stick cost the Kings a power play and a 
lead in Game 2 against Montreal. They had won the opener and might have gone 
home ahead, 2-0, if McSorley's penalty hadn't set up a Canadien rally. 
</P>
<P>
 Bure's folly Saturday might also be a turning point for the Canucks. Unless 
they rebound in Game 4 tonight at the Pacific Coliseum, they will go to New 
York for Thursday's game trailing, 3-1. That's a tightrope they don't want to 
walk again. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very important to get the first goal (tonight). What we did in the last 
game was very good, getting an early goal," said Bure, who leads playoff 
scorers with 13 goals. "We felt very well as a team. But then I took a stupid 
penalty and they scored a stupid goal. We're going to try and come out hard 
again." 
</P>
<P>
 He sees no reason to be more cautious, insisting his hit was unintentional. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just going to do what I did before, play hockey and help my team win," he 
said. "I'm not going to do something special." 
</P>
<P>
 Vancouver Coach Pat Quinn angrily rejected suggestions that Bure might want to 
tread carefully, perhaps forgetting Bure has a long list of questionable 
incidents. Before his elbow to the face of Dallas' Shane Churla in the 
quarterfinals earned him a $500 fine, he rammed into Calgary's Gary Roberts and 
drew a five-minute penalty for boarding. 
</P>
<P>
 "He shouldn't be changing his game at all," said Quinn, who contended that the 
Rangers' Mark Messier wouldn't have been ejected for the same offense. "It was 
accidental. It's not going to change his game or our game. We've got to go out 
and pound them even harder." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Bure's center, Trevor Linden, "Any criticism toward Pavel is unfair. This 
series is a long way from over. We've played three games. Three games into the 
Calgary series, it could be said Pavel didn't do a lot." 
</P>
<P>
 Bure had no goals in the first four games against Calgary, but came to life in 
the fifth. He scored three goals in the last three games, including the 
double-overtime series winner in Game 7. 
</P>
<P>
 He was nearly unstoppable against the Stars, scoring six goals in Vancouver's 
five-game romp. Toronto's dogged checking didn't stop him, either, and he 
scored four times in five semifinal games. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a complete player," Ranger goaltender Mike Richter said. "He's very, 
very strong. He's got a fantastic shot. He gets it off quickly and he places it 
well. He has all the physical skills. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's not only fast but quick off the go. He gets a lot of scoring 
opportunities because of his speed and he's a finisher." 
</P>
<P>
 Bure also presents a challenge because he's a left-handed shooter. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rangers tamed him in the first two games by picking him up in the neutral 
zone, where he likes to gather speed for rushes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unfortunately (in Game 3) we got caught on a line change and that's how he 
got a break," Ranger Coach Mike Keenan said. "That was his first break in the 
series, but that's the type of player he is. You give him one break and it's in 
your net." 
</P>
<P>
 The Canucks hope Bure creates breaks offensively, not on Ranger noses. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's one of our offensive leaders, if not the leader, and he enthused the 
crowd and the hockey club Saturday when he scored," forward Murray Craven said. 
"We fed off that and we need that to happen again. We need big plays from our 
big players." 
</P>
<P>
 There's no bigger game for the Canucks than tonight's. But Bure's expression 
remained impassive when asked if he owes the team a big game to compensate for 
sitting out most of Game 3. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to put pressure on myself," he said. "I just want to go on the 
ice and do the best that I can. If I can do something well enough and do 
something that helps the team defensively, or get (to) open ice for my 
teammates, I will do the best that I can do." 
</P>
<P>
 Hockey Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Vancouver defenseman Dana Murzyn, who suffered a knee injury in the first 
round, might replace Brian Glynn tonight. . . . Believing the line of Shawn 
Antoski, John McIntyre and Tim Hunter neutralized Mark Messier's line Saturday, 
Vancouver Coach Pat Quinn will try for that matchup again. "We want to hit Mark 
Messier as often as we can," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ranger defenseman Sergei Zubov, who sat out Game 3 because of a bruised chest, 
will be re-evaluated today. . . . Ranger Coach Mike Keenan said he's not 
worried about overconfidence tonight. "We know the Canucks will be a very 
desperate team and it's going to be an intense game," he said.

JURY AWARDS $2.1 MILLION TO COBB IN USC BIAS SUIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EARL GUSTKEY and MATT WHITE, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Apparently agreeing that USC unfairly penalized former assistant athletic 
director Marvin Cobb for complaining that the university's black athletes 
weren't getting the education promised them, a Los Angeles Superior Court jury 
awarded Cobb $2.1 million Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 USC said it would challenge half of the award immediately, and also ask for a 
new trial. 
</P>
<P>
 The case began in November of 1990 when Cobb sued, charging racial bias for 
his not having been promoted. Cobb, hired in 1986, claimed he wasn't given a 
promised promotion after two years. 
</P>
<P>
 A Trojan football and baseball player at USC in the 1970s and later an NFL 
player, Cobb was transferred in 1991 from the USC athletic department to the 
university's medical school as an associate dean for business affairs. That 
occurred a week after Cobb had criticized USC in a Sports Illustrated article, 
detailing problems he said black USC athletes had in getting counseling and 
tutoring.  
</P>
<P>
 "We're disappointed," said Bob Lane, USC's general counsel, of Monday's jury 
award. "We were very surprised. The university intends to take all appropriate 
action in seeking to ask the judge (William Drake) to reconsider the amount of 
the award. We'll ask for a new trial and we will appeal to the Court of 
Appeals." 
</P>
<P>
 Cobb was delighted, saying he had paid a price to make his point. 
</P>
<P>
 "I sacrificed quite a bit to make a point I feel was valid," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 "Universities need to live up to their obligation and educate student-athletes 
properly. I sacrificed my athletic administrative career on that point." 
</P>
<P>
 Cobb was put on unpaid administrative leave by USC in February, when the case 
went to trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Carl Douglas, co-counsel for USC, said USC would seek to strike from the award 
$1 million in emotional damages. Cobb was also awarded $1.1 million in economic 
damages. "We don't feel the emotional-damages award can be sustained under 
California law," Douglas said.  
</P>
<P>
 The jury was undecided on Cobb's race-discrimination charge in the suit, and 
Douglas said, "We have plans to retry that count." 
</P>
<P>
 Cobb has contended from the outset that he was not promoted by USC because of 
racial bias and because he had spoken about alleged mistreatment of black 
athletes. 
</P>
<P>
 USC contended that Cobb was not promoted because he was not keeping "regular 
office hours." 
</P>
<P>
 The suit originally named then-USC athletic director Mike McGee, who left the 
university in early 1993 to become athletic director at South Carolina.  
</P>
<P>
 Mike Garrett, then associate athletic director, was named to succeed McGee 
shortly afterward. But Cobb, two years after filing suit against USC, also 
applied for the post. 
</P>
<P>
 Cobb has also maintained that he and McGee had disagreed over how to counsel 
and tutor black USC athletes who were low achievers academically. 
</P>
<P>
 Last March, he told the Daily Trojan, USC's student newspaper, "SC loves to 
point to its academic resource center for athletes, and say it's the shining 
example of how seriously they take academics for athletes, and how many 
resources there are available for those who struggle." 
</P>
<P>
 But Cobb called the counseling-academics program for USC athletes "a mirage." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like having a calculus-tutoring service for students who haven't passed 
geometry," he said.

WORLD CUP '94: 10 DAYS AND COUNTING; DOOLEY FINDS PERSONAL KIND OF DREAM TEAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE CART, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 You can be inspired by a new light, and you can generate a new force enabling 
you to realize your hopes and make all your dreams come true. Decide now to 
make your life grander, greater, richer and nobler than ever before.  
</P>
<P>
 "The Power of Your Subconscious Mind," by Joseph Murphy 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 His brother was older, bigger and better. He worked harder. He ran every day, 
even if the family was on vacation, even if it was snowing, even when his body 
begged him to stay in bed. Steven told his younger brother, "Thomas, you must 
work harder." 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas Dooley said, "Yes, I must set a goal." He wanted to be like his 
brother. He wanted to be like the third-division soccer player who was the hero 
of his small German town. Both players could run, so Thomas would run, too. 
</P>
<P>
 His goal became to run from his town to the next, uphill, three miles. The 
first day he ran along the road for one mile and couldn't go on. Tomorrow, he 
thought, my goal is to go 100 meters farther. 
</P>
<P>
 For three weeks Thomas tried running to the next town, each day getting 
closer. He set his goal at running to the sign denoting the city limits. 
</P>
<P>
 "I will never forget this," Thomas Dooley said. "The last 200 yards I saw the 
sign. My legs were dead. I thought, 'I am so tired but I have to go on.' I hit 
the sign and I said, 'Yeah! I got my goal.' It was like Rocky in the movie." 
</P>
<P>
 It's a fitting reference for a man who grew up in Germany yearning for 
America, whose personal philosophy so well meshes with the American notion that 
if you work hard, then you can begin to achieve your dreams. 
</P>
<P>
 Dooley, a new American citizen and the most experienced player on the U.S. 
World Cup soccer team, is living his dream every day. His dream's edges have 
been pushed to places where he willed them and his goals -- ever changing -- 
are met daily with a headlong rush of enthusiasm. 
</P>
<P>
 His life has been so profoundly altered that he can't even see where he came 
from, only where he wants to go. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Change your thoughts and you change your destiny.  
</P>
<P>
 "The Power of Your Subconscious Mind" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Something was missing and Thomas Dooley was troubled by the loss. He was 17 
and he had been dutifully doing what was expected of him all his life. He was 
moving, but he had no direction. 
</P>
<P>
 "My brother and I were playing on a team in the worst league, the 11th 
division," he said. "Every Friday and Saturday night we went to a discotheque 
and drank beer and smoked. It's normal, but the next day we had a game. We 
talked about this and decided no more drinking and no more smoking. I have to 
work. I need more training. I need a plan." 
</P>
<P>
 He planned to get out of the life he was in. He was a highly skilled 
toolmaker, working from 6 a.m. until 2:30. Then he went home and watched 
television and played soccer. At that rate, he was going to do, for the rest of 
his life, what his uncles and his stepfather had done: What was expected, day 
after monotonous day. 
</P>
<P>
 Something was missing. One day a friend called Dooley to his office and sat 
him down. 
</P>
<P>
 "Is this what you are going to do with your life, work at a factory?" his 
friend asked. "Don't you want more?" 
</P>
<P>
 He handed Dooley a small paperback book, "The Power of Your Subconscious 
Mind," by Joseph Murphy. 
</P>
<P>
 Dooley read the book. And re-read it. He carried it with him and read certain 
parts during the day. He had found a plan. He had a goal. He would change his 
life. He would quit the factory and go to the university and study architecture 
and he and Steven would move up to a higher soccer league, where there were 
good fields to play on and real linesmen. 
</P>
<P>
 He changed the way he saw his world and the way he thought about it. 
</P>
<P>
 Along the way, inevitably, he saw that his world had changed. He began to 
notice that those around him always talked about what they couldn't do, what 
was not possible and how they had failed. Dooley only wanted to be around 
positive-thinking people. He became aware that his infectious good nature was 
at odds with the manner of the majority, those who would not look one another 
in the eye and brooded on their bad luck. 
</P>
<P>
 "In America, anything is possible," Dooley said, sitting in the bright 
sunshine of the U.S. team's training complex in Mission Viejo. "In Germany, 
most people look only one way. They say, 'I can't do that.' I say, 'Why can't 
you do that? You can do everything. You only have to believe in it and you have 
to do something.' 
</P>
<P>
 "Germany is a small country and a good business country. The business leaders 
are guys like Americans -- they think positive. They have goals. I changed my 
mentality. I began to think that way." 
</P>
<P>
 With his book as his guide and a head full of goals, Dooley set out on his new 
life. He had dreamed of playing in a higher division and soon he and Steven 
were sold to a third-division club. Then he moved to FC Homburg in the second 
division. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, as his goals and dreams began to come true, Dooley was at last in the 
Bundesliga, the highest level for a professional player in Germany. He was a 
central defender at FC Kaiserslautern, the club's captain. The only goal left 
in soccer was to play for his national team. 
</P>
<P>
 But which one?

<P>
 Where does a boy with a freckle-faced name like Thomas Dooley find a home in 
Bavaria? How is it to be a Tommy in a flock of kids named Wolfgang and Manfred? 
</P>
<P>
 He might have gone to his father with those questions but Dooley's father, an 
American serviceman stationed in Germany, left his wife and two young sons a 
year after Thomas was born. He returned to the United States and the family 
never heard from him again. After his first birthday, Dooley never saw his 
biological father, not even in a photograph. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, it was strange when Dooley grew up with decidedly American 
predilections. He loved American muscle cars, he chewed bubble gum, he listened 
to American rock 'n' roll and he dreamed of going on vacation to a ranch in 
Montana, one with horses and real cowboys. 
</P>
<P>
 His wife, Elke, grew up with Dooley and said he has always displayed a 
fondness for this country. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always say it's his American blood," she said. "He was always interested in 
America. He read books about it and watched American things on television. He 
loves American cars. Sometimes he wore crazy clothes like Americans." 
</P>
<P>
 Dooley's longing was never completely clear to him. One day he was driving and 
saw an American sports car. He followed the car until he got lost. He dreamed 
about the car. Not long afterward, he bought a 1977 Corvette. 
</P>
<P>
 When he was about 11 his mother married Horst Niebergall, a German. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was my dad," Dooley said. "He was good to us. When I needed someone, he 
was there to talk to. He was a soccer player, too. He spent a lot of time with 
us. 
</P>
<P>
 "About the time I started thinking about my (American) father, that I didn't 
have a dad and that my dad was American and I missed him, I got my German dad. 
We had a great connection. We have a wonderful relationship." 
</P>
<P>
 Dooley said he has never been angry about being abandoned. Years later, he and 
his brother talked about going to America to look for their father, simply to 
talk. Dooley's mother wrote to various addresses but received no answer. 
</P>
<P>
 Dooley's brother frequently traveled to the United States and in each town he 
looked in the phone book for Courtney Joseph Dooley. 
</P>
<P>
 "Steven tried to find him," Dooley said. "It was an adventure to go to America 
and find out our history and what was going on before. We were not angry. We 
would not say to him, 'Yeah, you left our mother at a bad time.' 
</P>
<P>
 "We talked about going to America. We made up stories about finding our 
father. Maybe we would go and knock on the door and say, 'Hi, this is us and we 
want to talk to you.' Small talk. Like, 'How do you live and what is your job 
right now? How is America and who are your friends?' Only small talk, not more. 
In America, someone could come up and say, 'I'm your cousin.' I did meet an 
aunt when the team was in Seattle. We drank coffee and talked. It was nice." 
</P>
<P>
 The Dooley brothers did finally get news of their father. He died in 1986 and 
is buried in San Francisco.

 "The Power of Your Subconscious Mind" 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 The phone rang at 4 in the morning and Elke Dooley remembers being alarmed. 
But Thomas was smiling into the receiver. 
</P>
<P>
 Dooley told her he had been asked to play for the U.S. national team. "Now 
your dream comes true," she said. "You can go to America. And I will go with 
you." 
</P>
<P>
 Dooley had been overlooked by the German national team because of injuries. At 
33, it was not likely that the German federation was ever going to call. 
</P>
<P>
 On that night in December of 1991, his decision was instantaneous, but he was 
concerned about the effect of the move on Elke and their sons, Marko, 13, and 
Dennis, 2. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes in your life, you must take a risk to come forward," Dooley says. 
"I know that this is not a risk. But people in Germany said to us, 'You go to 
America but you can't speak English. The American team is not so good, you can 
play here.' But no, my decision was to go to America. We go." 
</P>
<P>
 It was a decision that thrilled U.S. soccer officials and cost Dooley about 
$300,000 a year in salary. His answer is that he doesn't care. His answer is 
that he can drive to practice in the morning and see the palm trees in the 
sunshine and smell the ocean air. He can go home and be with his wife and 
family. He is setting and reaching his goals. 
</P>
<P>
 Dooley is, at last, in a place where he fits in. In his ardent love for what 
he perceives as the American dream, he has become more American than most. 
</P>
<P>
 "Success is when you have a problem and clear the problem," he said. "My goal 
here was to be successful on the national team. Then for our team to be 
successful. Then become one of the best players on the team. I got the 1993 
player-of-the-year (award). That was a goal. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am proud to play for the U.S. team. Now, my goal is that the people who are 
interested in soccer will be proud of us after the World Cup. When we come to 
the second round, that will be a success." World Cup Player at a Glance

JUNIOR WARNS MARINERS. . .; 'JUST WIN'; FRUSTRATED GRIFFEY SAYS SUCCESS RATE 
MUST IMPROVE FOR SEATTLE OR HE MIGHT LEAVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSS NEWHAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ken Griffey, Jr. turns his cap backward and turns on that infectious grin. He 
jumps into the batting cage and begins slashing line drives off the Kingdome 
fences. Nothing unusual except that the left-handed hitter is swinging 
right-handed and challenging the right-handed hitting Jay Buhner to match him 
swinging left-handed. 
</P>
<P>
 They may never take the junior out of Junior. They may never ebb his 
ebullience. 
</P>
<P>
 But in a season when his home run pace has been compared to that of Roger 
Maris' in 1961 and he has underscored his status as baseball's best player, 
Griffey has found frustration intruding on his fun. 
</P>
<P>
 He is 24, younger than either of 1993's rookies of the year, Mike Piazza and 
Tim Salmon, but it is easy to forget he is in his sixth year with a Seattle 
team that is 62 games under .500 during that span. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fun is in the winning and we're not again, so it isn't as much fun," 
Griffey said. He was sitting in the leather lounger that serves as his private 
clubhouse chair, but he had stood up one other day, questioning his team's 
heart and the future of the Mariners in Seattle, as well as his own future with 
the Mariners. The losing, he said, had begun to kill him. It was too easy, he 
said, for some players to roll over and quit. 
</P>
<P>
 The headlines rocked Seattle. The implication was that Griffey wanted out, had 
asked to be traded. 
</P>
<P>
 Forget his significance to the Mariner lineup. How would his departure affect 
proposals to build a new, retractable-roof stadium in the city? How would it 
affect downtown redevelopment and the proposed Niketown complex? 
</P>
<P>
 Doesn't that line of shoes carrying his name make its debut next month? 
Doesn't Nintendo, the money behind the Mariners, have a new baseball video game 
with Griffey's name on it? Weren't those corporate, civic and just plain 
citizens choking on their Frosted Flakes as they read the headlines? 
</P>
<P>
 The Mariners tried to douse the firestorm. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hell would have to freeze over before I traded Ken Griffey," General Manager 
Woody Woodward said. 
</P>
<P>
 Manager Lou Piniella said: "You don't trade the most talented and marketable 
player in the game." 
</P>
<P>
 This day, Piniella is sitting in the Kingdome dugout, saying how proud he was 
of Griffey for showing the maturity and leadership to say things that needed to 
be said about the team. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hell, I even hugged him," Piniella said. "He's disappointed and disgusted. 
He's frustrated with losing. When you get 25 players feeling that way, that's 
when you're headed in the right direction. But we're still a little short. I 
mean, you've got to come to the park obsessed with winning, but we're not 
totally there yet. 
</P>
<P>
 "The 162-game season is a grind. You're going to get angry and frustrated. The 
only players worth anything are those that do, that care. Junior could collect 
his check and go home at night without saying anything, but he's not that type 
player or man." 
</P>
<P>
 Junior insists that some of it was taken out of context, but if teammates were 
offended, so be it. He's always been his own man, he said, and they still have 
to respect what he does on the field. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I first came up, this was Alvin's team," he said of Alvin Davis. "Then 
it was Harold (Reynolds') and Val's (Dave Valle) team. Now it's my team and I'm 
not going to stand for the losing. I expect more. 
</P>
<P>
 "I mean, all I want to do is win. All I want to be remembered as is a winner. 
Ernie Banks never won and that seemed to be fine with him, but he's not me. I 
grew up in Cincinnati and saw what it was like with the Reds when my dad played 
for them. He has three World Series rings and has often told me it's the 
greatest feeling in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look at Joe Carter. He had great years, but all you would hear about him is 
how many times he had been traded. Then he got to Toronto and on a winner, and 
now what they talk about is what he did in the World Series. I just want people 
to understand where I'm coming from, not where I'm going." 
</P>
<P>
 Is he going, going, gone, as the cover of USA Today's Baseball Weekly 
suggested, blasting away from Puget Sound soon in his Ferrari F-40? 
</P>
<P>
 "I never asked to be traded and never said I wanted to be traded," Griffey 
said. "I love Seattle and want to be on a team the city can be proud of, but 
things have got to change, and what people have forgotten in all of this is 
that I've volunteered to defer my salary (of $7 million a year) in 1995 and '96 
if it would help the team produce a winner. 
</P>
<P>
 "Where this started was that (a reporter) asked me if I would sign an 
extension as the situation exists now, and I said no -- but my (four-year, 
$24-million) contract doesn't expire until after the 1996 season, and I 
wouldn't expect to be offered an extension until after next season. That's the 
way it's usually done. 
</P>
<P>
 "I also said that I don't see how the Mariners can survive beyond 1996 (when 
the Kingdome lease expires) without better corporate support or how they can 
afford to keep me. I still don't. I see a lot of good people leaving if we 
don't win. Just look at myself, Buhner, (Chris) Bosio, (Randy) Johnson and 
(Edgar) Martinez. That's five people making $22.5 million next year and the 
budget is $28 million. It doesn't work." 
</P>
<P>
 None of that, though, has seemed to affect his performance or approach. 
</P>
<P>
 Griffey is batting .327 and leads the American League in home runs with 23 and 
total bases with 153. His pace projects to 68 homers, which would break Maris' 
1961 record of 61, and 450 total bases, approaching Babe Ruth's 1921 record of 
457. 
</P>
<P>
 He is second in slugging percentage, extra-base hits and runs, and is among 
the top 10 in runs batted in with 46. In a 162-game span since May 30, 1993, 
the equivalent of a full season, he hit 58 homers, drove in 127 runs, had 35 
doubles and batted .320 -- all this while seldom getting a decent pitch, 
particularly with the game on the line. 
</P>
<P>
 As Reynolds, the former Mariner second baseman now with the Angels, said when 
asked if he stays in touch with his former teammate: "I just tune in ESPN. He's 
his own highlight film. It's easy to stay in touch with him." 
</P>
<P>
 Griffey is headed for his fourth straight season of 100 or more RBIs. He was 
second in the league with 45 homers last year, finished among the league 
leaders in 11 offensive categories and won his fourth straight Gold Glove for 
fielding superiority. 
</P>
<P>
 "You look at the six years and he's done everything he's supposed to do," said 
Griffey's dad, Ken, the 19-year former major leaguer who is a roving hitting 
instructor with the Mariners. "It goes without saying that if he'd been in a 
stronger lineup, his numbers would (have been) even better." 
</P>
<P>
 Woodward said he expects Griffey's numbers to continue improving as he gains 
more experience and maturity.  
</P>
<P>
 "I see an added dimension in the intensity with which he's now playing and the 
ease with which he adjusts to pitchers and situations," Woodward said. "I don't 
at all suggest that what we've seen so far is the best he can be. I think he'll 
get better." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Piniella, raising an eyebrow: "He's already the total package. How can he 
get better? The media try to create a monster at times. How good does he have 
to get to satisfy everyone? All he has to do is maintain." 
</P>
<P>
 Griffey, of course, has always carried high expectations -- his own and 
others'. 
</P>
<P>
 His mother, Alberta, tells the story of Junior never making an out in an 
organized game until he was 15 and reacting to it by telling her he wanted to 
quit. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why are you so upset?" she said. "Your dad makes outs all the time." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not my dad," Junior responded. "I don't make outs." 
</P>
<P>
 Then there was his debut with the Mariners, when he got a hit in his first 
at-bat and went hitless in his next 15. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were sitting there in Chicago -- Junior, me and Alvin Davis -- and Junior 
is in tears, saying he'll never get another hit," Reynolds recalled. "I felt 
like telling him, 'Kid, if you only knew.' I mean, I remember him when he was 
17 or 18 and coming to work out with us, just after he was drafted, and 
rocketing balls into the seats. You could tell right then he was something 
special." 
</P>
<P>
 The Mariners had the first pick in the 1987 draft but then-owner George 
Argyros, who lives in Orange County, wanted to select Cal State Fullerton 
pitcher Mike Harkey over the objections of the scouting department, which 
quietly beefed up the already flawless reports on Griffey to a level Argyros 
couldn't resist. 
</P>
<P>
 The teen-age Griffey operated strictly on instinct and reaction. A veteran 
Mariner once tried to school him on the repertoire of pitcher Bert Blyleven, 
instructing Griffey that Blyleven liked to throw the back-door slider to 
left-handed hitters with two strikes. 
</P>
<P>
 Griffey listened, then asked: "Is Blyleven right- or left-handed?" 
</P>
<P>
 Griffey still likes to sell the "see it, hit it" routine, still likes to give 
the impression that he prepares by talking to hot dog vendors while in the 
on-deck circle, but Piniella says: "A lot of it now is experience and maturity, 
but Junior studies pitchers more than people think. Home runs aren't muscle, 
they're bat speed. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can pitch a lot of home run hitters a certain way and establish an edge. 
You can't with Junior. He knows his strike zone, and it is basically without 
vulnerabilities and weaknesses." 
</P>
<P>
 Griffey maintains that the home run isn't his forte, that he is a line-drive 
hitter capable of hitting home runs, that he is basically following his 
father's edict, "There's money in left field, too." Meaning: Use the whole 
field; pull only when the pitch is there. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not your traditional home run hitter," Griffey said. "Look at guys like 
Jose Canseco and Cecil Fielder and Juan Gonzalez. They've got 19-inch biceps 
and I've got these puny 12-inchers, if that. I'm not big or small. I'm right in 
the middle. 
</P>
<P>
 "Traditional home run hitters spend all their time in the weight room. I was 
in there for 10 minutes during spring training, and they thought they were 
going to have to call the paramedics. My dad always told me, 'Home runs are 
nice, but it's what you do in the other 500 at-bats that counts.' There's more 
ways to beat a team than with a home run, and I'd rather get on base and set 
the table." 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe, but his 45 homers last season left him only one behind the major league 
leaders, Gonzalez and Barry Bonds. He also tied a major league record by 
hitting homers in eight straight games and became the first player to hit a 
ball off the B & O warehouse behind the right-field stands at Baltimore's 
Camden Yards during the All-Star home run contest. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, he set a major league record for homers through May with 22, 
breaking Mickey Mantle's 1956 record of 20. Different pitchers, equipment and 
eras, Griffey said, refusing to draw comparisons to Mantle. 
</P>
<P>
 Maris is still out there, with all the inherent pressure, perhaps, of a 
summer-long pursuit, but Griffey said: "If it happens, it happens. I ain't 
going to eat, sleep or drink 61. I've got to get to 30, 40, 50 and 60 first, 
and I'd like to have as much fun with it as I can. I mean, what do I have to 
prepare for? Instead of talking to three or four of you guys every day, once a 
day I'd have to talk to 50 of you." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, Griffey said, he's conditioned to going sleepless in Seattle. Whether 
it's relaxing with his late-night video favorite, Mortal Kombat, bowling with 
friends, romping with his four dogs or trying to keep his and wife Melissa's 
4-month-old son, Trey, quiet through the night. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pressure?" Griffey said with a laugh. "Pressure is trying to change diapers 
when the kid is throwing a fit." 
</P>
<P>
 Griffey has always dismissed pressure. He grew up among Pete Rose, Johnny 
Bench and Tony Perez in the Reds' clubhouse. 
</P>
<P>
 The major leagues were just another step in his baseball schooling. The senior 
Griffey said he tried to make sure his son remained a kid as long as possible, 
and Pete Rose told him: "If you play as a kid, you'll always enjoy it." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, however, the senior Griffey is a little concerned about some of the 
reaction to Junior's recent comments and all the premature comparisons to 
Maris. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he has confidence in Junior's ability to remain cool and consistent 
but added: "He's out there playing and trying to have a good time, but there's 
always people who want to screw it up. He's not worried about the record or 
other garbage, but there's still people interested in putting pressure on him." 
</P>
<P>
 Griffey has homered in his last 12 games, once in his last eight. Reality 
tends to dim projections. A labor stoppage might intercede as well. Griffey 
said he will look at his numbers only when the season is over. 
</P>
<P>
 "You start to worry about this pace or that pace, or about what Mantle or Ruth 
or Maris did, and you start to doubt yourself," he said. "I never was into 
baseball history. I never collected anything. I never was into records." 
</P>
<P>
 Some have suggested that Griffey would be better off if he didn't break this 
one because the expectations, already large in his case, would soar, but he 
doesn't buy that. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I break the record and hit 30 next year, they can't take the record away 
from me," he said. "People will always remember I had a marvelous year in 1994, 
but they can't expect me to repeat it every year. They'd be out of their minds 
if they did."

JIM MURRAY: WALLACH IS HIS NAME . . . AND THE WALL IS HIS AIM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM MURRAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The late Fresco Thompson, who knew as much about the game as anyone who ever 
played it or logged it, used to tell me there were two kinds of hitters in 
baseball, "Those who hit for average -- and those who hit for damage." 
</P>
<P>
 The distinction is subtle. A baseball team is made up of those who are meant 
to score runs -- and those who are meant to drive in those runs.  
</P>
<P>
 There has never been any question as to which category Timothy Charles Wallach 
of the Dodgers fits into. Tim has always been a guy who would rather go one for 
four, the hit a double driving in runs, than three for four with only the 
decimals showing for the day's work and the only impact on his average, not the 
team's. 
</P>
<P>
 There is in baseball an invisible line. It's called "the Mendoza Line," after 
Mario Mendoza, an infielder for Pittsburgh, Seattle and Texas who played nine 
seasons in the big leagues and batted worse than .200 in five of them.  
</P>
<P>
 This is widely held to be the epitome of futility in the big leagues, a 
standard of failure you almost have to admire for its ineptitude. Mendoza hit 
only four home runs in his entire career and his slugging average was only 
minimally higher than his batting average (.200 one season). In his last 
season, he only got two hits. 
</P>
<P>
 In American annals, the name Benedict Arnold stands for traitor, Nathan Hale 
stands for patriot, Barney Oldfield stands for speed, Charlie Chaplin means 
comedy. And Mario Mendoza signifies an out. The Great American Out. You didn't 
look for him to do much except pop up. He didn't strike out all that much. 
Pitchers hated to use three pitches getting him out.  
</P>
<P>
 But when Tim Wallach tilted dangerously toward that Mendoza line a couple of 
years ago and his average moved from .296 to .225 and .223 and .222, no one was 
unduly alarmed. Wallach was probably one of the most dangerous .225 hitters who 
ever lived. First of all, he drove in 73 runs with that average one year. He 
knocked in 62 last year with .222. You will find guys in the lineup with 80 
more points of average -- but 20 fewer runs batted in and even one guy with 73 
more points of average and only 29 RBIs.  
</P>
<P>
 In baseball's record book are marks that stand as milestones for everyone to 
shoot at. For instance, it lists all players who have 250 or more home runs. 
There are 103 of them. Wallach isn't among them. Yet. But he does have 229. 
Inclusion is very probable before he is through.  
</P>
<P>
 The cutoff point for RBIs is 1,200. There are 77 players -- out of the 
thousands who have played this game -- who have 1,200 or more runs batted in. 
Wallach has 1,009. 
</P>
<P>
 In slugging average, the cutoff is .400. Only 51 players from Babe Ruth's .690 
to Brooks Robinson's .401 make it. Wallach is at .355 and has a .510 slugging 
average this season. 
</P>
<P>
 What he never does is merely meet the ball. 
</P>
<P>
 "I try to hit it hard some place," he acknowledges. 
</P>
<P>
 He had only one sacrifice bunt last season and that was the first since 1982, 
when he had the only other five of his career. But he had nine sacrifice flies 
and led the club in that category last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't say I don't try to move the runner along from first to third," he 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 But, basically, he tries to hit the wall with a pitch.  
</P>
<P>
 Wallach is batting .276, but he doesn't look for a run at the batting crown. 
He leaves that for the choke-up hitters, the walk-getters -- he walked only 32 
times in his 500-plus plate appearances last season -- the bat manipulators. 
</P>
<P>
 Strikeouts, of course, are a problem. Wallach goes for some pitches that have 
a good chance to be wild. But bad-ball hitters are not always regrettable -- or 
regretful. Roberto Clemente bad-balled his way into the Hall of Fame.  
</P>
<P>
 A measure of Wallach's worth to the ballclub is, he has always batted fourth 
or fifth. He might be the only guy in baseball history ever to bat cleanup when 
he was hitting .222. He has never batted .300. His high-water mark was .298 in 
1987 at Montreal, when he hit 26 homers and drove in 123 runs. He batted .296 
in 1990. He has hit more than 20 home runs four times and more than 25 twice. 
</P>
<P>
 Managers have a hard job relating to guys who return to the dugout a lot with 
what the ballplayers call "oh-fers" -- zero for a time at bat, or a whole game 
at bat. But when you divide Wallach's 1,844 hits -- or even his 7,205 at-bats 
-- into his 1,009 runs batted in, you can see he's a highly-productive batsman, 
entitled to the odd oh-fer. Wallach can ask management, "Do you want a run -- 
or a decimal point?" 
</P>
<P>
 The record book cutoff for two-base-hits is 450. Fifty-three players have 
more. Wallach is at 392 and climbing. 
</P>
<P>
 As Fresco would say, he's a player who hits for damage. He's like a fighter 
with a KO punch and no footwork. He won't jab you to death, but you make one 
mistake and they carry you out. 
</P>
<P>
 He's never going to catch Rose or Cobb with their 4,000 hits and 700 doubles. 
But he has a shot at Rose's 1,314 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
 Not many players have done as much with 1,844 hits as he has. He's like a 
football team that doesn't get the ball much -- but doesn't need it much. As 
Satchel Paige would say, "He ain't restful to pitch to."

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Rams acquired free agent wide receiver Jessie Hester on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Hester, a former Raider who caught 64 passes for 835 yards with Indianapolis 
last season, agreed to a one-year contract with the Rams, who will also have an 
option on Hester's services in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Hester was a first-round draft choice of the Raiders in 1985 before being 
traded to Atlanta in 1988. The Falcons released him in 1989, and after signing 
with Indianapolis in 1990, he went on to average 57 catches a season with the 
Colts. T.J. SIMERS

 The Dodgers switched Sizemore from catcher to the infield and he was voted 
rookie of the year in 1969 as a shortstop-second baseman. He went to St. Louis 
after the 1970 season in a trade for Richie Allen, came back to Los Angeles for 
the 1976 season, and retired in Boston in 1980 with a .262 lifetime average. 
</P>
<P>
 Sizemore, 49, is an executive at Rawlings Sporting Goods in St. Louis. He is 
in charge of supplying major league baseball with most of its equipment -- 
including more than 700,000 baseballs a year -- and is coordinating the sport's 
growth efforts overseas. An avid golfer with homes in Missouri and Palm 
Springs, he is also a director of the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation.LOS ANGELES

 Wright's brief career seemed to be over when he was waived by the Angels after 
a 1-8 season in 1969 and no other team claimed him. But the left-hander learned 
how to throw a screwball while playing winter ball, was re-signed by the club, 
and threw a no-hitter against Oakland on his way to a 22-12 record in 1970.He 
retired in 1975 with a 100-111 record. 
</P>
<P>
 Wright, 53, still lives in Anaheim and runs a pitching school for ballplayers 
of all ages. He also works for the Angels' speakers bureau, warning about the 
dangers of drugs. Wright's son, Jaret, is a pitcher at Anaheim Katella High who 
was picked by Cleveland in the first round of last week's amateur draft.

<P>
 You'll have to excuse Charley Hoffman if he wasn't doing back flips after 
winning the CIF-Southern California Golf Assn. boys' title Monday at Redlands 
Country Club. 
</P>
<P>
 Sure Hoffman, a junior at Poway High, had won the most important high school 
tournament in Southern California with a two-under-par 68, but he recently won 
his first title on the national junior circuit and said high school competition 
pales in comparison. 
</P>
<P>
 Jenny Lee, a junior from Fullerton Sunny Hills, won the girls' title by one 
stroke, shooting one-over 74 to beat two-time defending champion Kellee Booth 
of Santa Margarita. Julie Oh of Torrance finished third at 76. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoffman finished three strokes ahead of Ryan King of Rancho Buena Vista High 
and Jeremy Whiting of Palm Desert. "A lot of people are going to see that I 
won," Hoffman said. "This is a good tournament; a lot of good players are 
here." 
</P>
<P>
 Two were absent. Southern Section champion Tiger Woods of Anaheim Western was 
playing a practice round for the Buick Open in New York and City champion 
Darren Angel of Granada Hills was at U.S. Open qualifying. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoffman also helped Poway to second place in the team competition. Poway, the 
San Diego Section runner-up, finished with 380 strokes, four behind Palm 
Desert, the Southern Section runner-up.

PREP BASEBALL; CABRERA LIFTS FRANKLIN TO CITY 3-A CHAMPIONSHIP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Oscar Cabrera went two for three and drove in the game-winning run Monday to 
lead Franklin to a 2-1 victory and the City 3-A Division championship at Dodger 
Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Franklin finished 21-4-1. 
</P>
<P>
 With the score tied, 1-1, Cabrera hit a double in the bottom of the fifth 
inning to drive in Jeff Deno, who had singled, advanced to second on a 
sacrifice fly by Rick Catano and advanced to third on a passed ball by 
Huntington Park catcher Raul Ocequeda. 
</P>
<P>
 Catano (8-1) gave up eight hits and struck out three while earning the win. 
</P>
<P>
 "I sat back more and at the end, I gave it all I had and it came through for 
me," Catano said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mario Arambula (6-4) struck out eight in the loss for Huntington Park (12-8). 
</P>
<P>
 Franklin's Lorenso Marquez started the scoring in the fourth inning after he 
singled, stole second and scored on an error by Huntington Park first-baseman 
Armando Matos. Huntington Park's Hugo Villagrana responded in the top of the 
fifth inning when he singled, advanced to second on a single by Juan Carillo 
and scored on a single by Matos. 
</P>
<P>
 El Camino Real 6, Chatsworth 6: In the City Section 4-A championship, 
Chatsworth scored five runs in the seventh to send the game to extra innings. 
</P>
<P>
 It was still tied heading into the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
 Trailing, 6-1, and facing Randy Wolf, who had allowed only an infield single 
until that point, Chatsworth scored five runs on four hits in the top of the 
seventh inning to tie the score. 
</P>
<P>
 Wolf hit Danny Martin, who was pinch hitting for Mike Amado. Martin later 
scored on a double by Eric Rovner. 
</P>
<P>
 Rovner advanced to third on a single by Rod Daryabigi and scored on a single 
by Ray Daryabigi. 
</P>
<P>
 Ray Daryabigi advanced to second on a single by Bryan LaCour. Both Ray 
Daryabigi and LaCour scored on consecutive errors by Matt Tays and Justin 
Martin. 
</P>
<P>
 El Camino began quickly, scoring five runs on two hits in the bottom of the 
first inning. 
</P>
<P>
 Chatsworth pitcher Jim DeBiase walked Justin Martin, the first batter he 
faced. Martin advanced to second on a groundout and scored after Craig Carlton 
hit a grounder to shallow right field. 
</P>
<P>
 Wolf, who was intentionally walked in his first at-bat, advanced to second on 
Carlton's single, and Carlton scored on a first-pitch double to deep center by 
Billy Burnette. 
</P>
<P>
 Matt Tays reached first on an error by Bryan La Cour, which also advanced 
Burnett to third. 
</P>
<P>
 Burnett later scored on a passed ball by catcher Brandon Murphy and another 
error by La Cour scored Tays. 
</P>
<P>
 Chatsworth struck in the top of the third inning, after Wolf walked Jeremy 
Tayahua, Ray Daryabigi singled and Wolf hit La Cour to advance Tayahua to 
third. 
</P>
<P>
 Tayahua scored on a balk.

GETTING INVOLVED: MAKING A DIFFERENCE IN YOUR COMMUNITY; GROUP HELPS FEED 
HUNGRY IN THE VALLEY

<P>
 Rummaging through the large industrial garbage bins next to the truck delivery 
entrance at the Ralphs market on Laurel Canyon near Ventura Boulevard, the two 
women seemed oblivious to the stares of passersby and the supermarket employee 
sitting on the loading dock. 
</P>
<P>
 On the ground near them lay several heads of lettuce and a few assorted 
vegetables, the trophies from their search.  
</P>
<P>
 Down and out in Studio City. Not a scene from a movie, but rather a real-life 
survival act played out in a high-rent part of Los Angeles, where pockets of 
poverty seem invisible and home prices now average $225,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hunger and homelessness in the Valley started getting bad during the 1980s, 
but our economic problems and the disappearance of so many social service 
programs has made the situation much worse now," says Margery Gossard, the 
North Hollywood Interfaith Food Pantry's volunteer secretary for Records and 
Statistics. 
</P>
<P>
 "The number of homeless has really shot up," she adds. "We're also serving a 
lot of working poor."  
</P>
<P>
 Gossard defines the working poor as people who can't afford to pay rent and 
buy food at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
 She says the pantry serves a large numbers of veterans, seniors and the 
disabled, and also feeds a tremendous number of children. 
</P>
<P>
 "Historically, half the people we serve have been children," she says. In 
April, the most recent period for which statistics are available, Gossard says 
that translates into half the 5,345 people served. "We have so many families, 
of all races and creeds, living out of their cars in little pockets near the 
parks in North Hollywood, Studio City and Sun Valley, it just breaks your heart 
to see it."  
</P>
<P>
 A retired college music instructor, Gossard began working at the pantry 11 
years ago because she wanted to stay active in retirement. At times, she says, 
the work's been emotionally draining, but she's stuck with it because of the 
spiritual returns. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're just a drop in the bucket, and they need so much more help that 
sometimes it all seems hopeless. However," she says, "I've met so many 
wonderful and committed people from different religions, it's all been worth 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 The pantry was started in March, 1983, by five women from different Christian 
and Jewish congregations. Organized under the sponsorship of the San Fernando 
Valley Interfaith Council as a non-sectarian, nonprofit volunteer agency, the 
pantry has so far fed 585,165 people. Today, those five contributing religious 
congregations have grown to eight area Protestant churches, one reform Jewish 
temple and one conservative synagogue.  
</P>
<P>
 The pantry's distribution site, open Mondays and Fridays from 10 a.m. to 1 
p.m., consists of two small Sunday school rooms provided by the First Christian 
Church at the corner of Colfax Avenue and Moorpark Street, North Hollywood. 
Food storage space is donated by Temple Beth Hillel, also in North Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 Although donations of food and money come from individuals, congregations, 
private and public groups, and such supermarket chains as Lucky, which donates 
several tons of bakery goods per month, most food comes from the L. A. Regional 
Food Bank. 
</P>
<P>
 Additionally, says Kathryn Tate, the pantry's volunteer director, the group 
also provides approximately 20 bags of food per week to the Necessities of Life 
program, a food project of AIDS Project L.A. To volunteer time or donate food 
or money, call (818) 980-1657. 
</P>
<P>
 Walden Environment-Foster Family Agency is looking for volunteers to help with 
a June 25 picnic for 150 abused and neglected children. The summer picnic is 
scheduled 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. at El Cariso Park in Sylmar. Volunteers are needed. 
Contact Tanya at (818) 365-3665.

 Officials have announced a series of workshops to brief those interested in 
participating in a first-time home buyer program provided by the city of 
Glendale in conjunction with Coast Federal Bank. 
</P>
<P>
 The city has received more than 600 inquiries about the program since its 
debut in early May.The program is designed to help moderate-income Glendale 
residents purchase a starter home, condominium or townhome. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of the offer, Coast Federal Bank provides the first mortgage on the 
home, with the city providing a second mortgage to bridge the gap between the 
first loan and the home's price.  
</P>
<P>
 The maximum home purchase price eligible for the program is $200,000 for a 
condominium and $250,000 for a home or townhouse. 
</P>
<P>
 Single people making no more than $40,550 a year, couples bringing in less 
than $46,350 annually and a family of three earning no more than $52,150 per 
year are eligible to apply for assistance from the program. 
</P>
<P>
 The city will hold a public lottery at the end of June to determine each 
applicant's standing. 
</P>
<P>
 Workshops discussing the program will be held from 7 to 9 p.m. Wednesday, and 
from 7 to 9 p.m. June 15. All seminars will be held at the Central Library 
Auditorium, 222 E. Harvard St. To register for a workshop call the Department

<TEXT>
<P>
 Keep walking, and keep healthy. 
</P>
<P>
 That's the theme of an early-morning walking program for senior citizens 
scheduled this summer on the track at Golden West College. 
</P>
<P>
 The 10-session program starts June 24 and continues through Aug. 26. 
</P>
<P>
 Registration is currently underway at the college's Community Services Office. 
The program fee is $26. 
</P>
<P>
 "The program is recommended for all seniors who are new to exercise as well as 
participants in the Golden West College beginning and advanced aerobic-exercise 
workshops," said Lori Thomas, a spokeswoman for the college. 
</P>
<P>
 "Emphasis is placed on breathing and walking posture, and (the class) provides 
a cardiovascular workout, including warm-up, walk-out, cool-down and final 
stretch-out exercises. 
</P>
<P>
 Walking shoes and sweat suits are recommended." 
</P>
<P>
 The instructor for the walking workshop is Ruth E. Bennett, who holds a 
master's degree in education with emphasis on fitness for older adults. 
</P>
<P>
 The walking class is designed for "active seniors, ages 55 to 79," college 
officials said. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A free workshop to help earthquake-impacted business owners complete forms for 
Small Business Administration disaster loans -- even if they have already been 
turned down -- is scheduled tonight at Mission College's Business and 
Professional Center in San Fernando. 
</P>
<P>
 Taught by representatives of the Small Business Development Center of North 
Los Angeles County, the workshop will begin at 6:30 p.m. in Room 5 of the 
center, at 1300 San Fernando Road. 
</P>
<P>
 "We found that a lot of people, because they hadn't filled out the paperwork 
properly, were being turned down by the SBA," said Ralph Kacy, the center's 
research director. "They didn't realize they could send it back, with 
additional information, to reapply for the loans." 
</P>
<P>
 The California Community Colleges is sponsoring the workshops with a $10,000 
grant, which also pays for individual counseling for business owners. 
</P>
<P>
 The workshop will be repeated at 6:30 p.m. on Tuesday, June 21. For more 
information, contact the Business and Professional Center at (818) 837-2236.

PROPERTY VALUES: KICKBACKS ARE COMMON, AND CONSUMERS FOOT THE BILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Ron Galperin 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Your real estate agent may be making more money than he or she is telling you 
about when representing you in the purchase of a home or condo. 
</P>
<P>
 Many title companies, mortgage brokers, appraisers, escrow companies and home 
inspection services say they regularly get requests from real estate agents for 
a kickback in exchange for referring their would-be buyers. While this practice 
generally violates several federal and state laws, people in the industry 
concede that it happens all the time. It's the consumer who really ends up 
footing the bill in the form of inflated fees for the purchase of real estate. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is an inordinate amount of graft going on," said Claudia Queen, sales 
manager and vice president at Stewart Title in Glendale. "We get requests all 
the time from agents requesting money, trips, office furniture -- the sky is 
the limit on what we've been asked." Queen said that Stewart refuses to pay any 
so-called incentives, premiums, rebates or kickbacks to real estate agents who 
refer business. "I'm not going to violate the law and go to jail for a bit of 
extra work," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Queen claims that one of her competitors is offering free trips to 
Mexico for every 20 consumers referred by a real estate agent. 
</P>
<P>
 Another title company, First American Title Insurance Co. in Oxnard, said it 
offers agents who refer clients reduced rates for limousine service provided by 
a firm associated with the company's sales manager. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is some reasonable latitude given for us to provide normal business 
lunches, dinners, etc." to real estate agents, explained Robert Noe, vice 
president at First American. "I really don't see it as a problem." 
</P>
<P>
 "I know of a real estate agent who's entire advertising bill with a newspaper 
was paid by a title insurance company in return for 100% of his business," said 
Linda L. McLain, president of McLain Escrow Inc. in Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 Just how much all of this boosts real estate transactions is unclear. But for 
home buyers who are usually already strapped for cash, every penny counts. 
</P>
<P>
 "Consumers don't know this is going on. They rely on their agent to make an 
unbiased recommendation when it comes to various services." McLain said. "The 
biggest problem is the lack of disclosure." 
</P>
<P>
 "I know agents steer (business) and get kickbacks," said Alice McCain, 
president of the San Fernando Valley Assn. of Realtors Inc. But, she added, 
"there are abuses in every business." 
</P>
<P>
 Some agents collect a pay-back out of ignorance and others do it deliberately, 
McCain said. Either way, "that's not how it should be done," she said. "When I 
refer a client to a mortgage broker or title company, I expect the client to 
get good service -- that's all," McCain said. "Your license and livelihood is 
at stake if you get any money out of it." 
</P>
<P>
 While both the federal government and the state of California prohibit real 
estate agents from getting certain types of referral fees, the laws are 
routinely violated and there are also loopholes in the rules. Agents aren't 
allowed to get so-called "naked referral fees" for simply referring business. 
If the agent does more than just refer the business, however, the money the 
agent gets back may not necessarily be considered a referral fee, explained 
Marcia Salkin, manager of public policy for the California Assn. of Realtors in 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 There are other loopholes. Both state law and the federal Real Estate 
Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA) prohibit a real estate licensee from making 
money off a referral to service providers such as escrow, title, pest control 
and home warranty companies, said Steve Ellis, Los Angeles district office 
manager for the California Department of Real Estate. However, the department 
does not prohibit payment of a referral fee on any loans. And while the federal 
act prohibits a referral fee to be received by real estate agents, RESPA 
applies only to transactions involving federally insured institutions or 
financing. 
</P>
<P>
 And recent amendments to RESPA now allow real estate brokerage firms to form 
partnerships called "controlled business arrangements" (CBAs) with service 
providers and then split the take. It's unclear exactly how all these new CBAs 
will work, conceded Salkin. "There is still a lot of uncertainty about the law 
and people have differing interpretations." 
</P>
<P>
 The CBA exceptions to RESPA's rules against collusion by members of the real 
estate industry will provide a way for brokerage firms to vastly increase their 
income, predicted Steven L. Bailey, an attorney and consultant to Safeway 
Financial Services, an Encino mortgage broker. 
</P>
<P>
 Bailey said he has already created partnerships between Safeway and three real 
estate brokerage companies. Now those real estate firms can legally get a cut 
of the fee earned by mortgage brokers, Bailey said. 
</P>
<P>
 Everybody in the real estate industry is looking for ways to make more money, 
Bailey said. Many real estate agents and service providers who don't form a CBA 
will keep on violating the laws, he said. "It will likely continue to be a 
pervasive problem."

MICHIGAN SUPREME COURT AGREES TO HEAR APPEALS IN KEVORKIAN CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The state Supreme Court agreed Monday to hear appeals in several cases 
involving Michigan's law banning assisted suicide and attempts to prosecute Dr. 
Jack Kevorkian for murder. 
</P>
<P>
 The court said it would decide whether the assisted suicide law violated the 
state or federal constitutions and whether Kevorkian can be tried for murder in 
the assisted suicides of two women who died before the state ban was in 
place.Arguments were scheduled for Oct. 4. 
</P>
<P>
 The Michigan Court of Appeal ruled May 10 that the assisted suicide ban was 
unconstitutional because of a flaw in the way it was adopted. 
</P>
<P>
 The law, passed specifically to stop Kevorkian, was added to a bill setting up 
a commission to study assisted suicide. The Michigan constitution requires that 
bills cover only one subject. 
</P>
<P>
 The appeals court also ruled May 10 that the state constitution guarantees no 
right to suicide or assisted suicide. And it said Kevorkian could be tried for 
murder in connection with two assisted suicides that took place in 1991 before 
the law was passed.

NORTH WINS SOME GOP BACKERS BUT NOT FORMER PRESIDENT FORD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Oliver L. North won muted endorsements Monday from a handful of potential 
Republican Senate colleagues, but former President Gerald R. Ford joined other 
prominent Republicans who have refused to back the former White House aide in 
his bid for U.S. Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 The support for North's Virginia nomination included a pledge from the 
National Republican Senatorial Committee, which said it was confident the 
controversial Iran-Contra figure would "wage a strong campaign to reclaim this 
seat" from Democrat Charles S. Robb. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Phil Gramm of Texas, the committee chairman, said: "The Republican Party 
of Virginia has spoken and I intend to support their nominee." 
</P>
<P>
 Privately, however, a source close to Gramm said the senator was "no Ollie 
North fan," a sentiment echoed by many other Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
 Ford did not say whom he would support in the Nov. 8 election. But he 
indicated he might support the likely independent candidacy of a former state 
attorney general, J. Marshall Coleman. 
</P>
<P>
 North won the nomination at the state GOP convention Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 It was clear, however, that there is deep unease in the party at the prospect 
of North serving in the Congress he lied to about his arms-for-hostages 
dealings. 
</P>
<P>
 "I support the nominee of the party as chosen by the members of the party in 
Virginia," Sen. Paul Coverdell of Georgia said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The people of Virginia have chosen Oliver North as their candidate and I 
support their right to make that decision," said Sen. Dan Coats of Indiana. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Republicans of Virginia have spoken," said Sen. Strom Thurmond of South 
Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. John W. Warner (R-Va.) already has said he would oppose North and support 
Coleman. 
</P>
<P>
 Senate Republican leader Bob Dole of Kansas raised eyebrows throughout the 
party Sunday by saying that he planned to meet with Coleman this week. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, Dole issued a statement saying his "main priority in Virginia, as 
in every other state, is winning the Senate seat for the Republican Party." 
</P>
<P>
 But Dole's statement did not endorse North.

ORANGE COUNTY VOICES: SANTA ANA SHOWS UNITY IN DIVIDED TIMES; SOCIETY: IN A 
SESSION FULL OF HOPE, 1,500 RESIDENTS COME OUT TO PROVE TO THE SUPERINTENDENT 
AND THE MAYOR THAT YES, THEY CARE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAIME SOTO, Rev. Monsignor Jaime Soto is the Episcopal Vicar for the 
Hispanic Community for the Diocese of Orange. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On May 11, I was privileged to be among 1,500 Santa Ana residents as they 
brought before the mayor of Santa Ana, Dan Young, and the superintendent of 
Santa Ana Unified School District, Rudy Castruita, a well-considered list of 
recommendations aimed at improving the opportunities for an important part of 
California's restless future: the city's young people.  
</P>
<P>
 It was not a session of taunts or bitter accusations. Those who boldly gave 
voice to the inquietude of the many pensive parents assembled offered an 
earnest partnership to city officials. The residents looked for a chance to 
work with the city, the police and the schools in ways that could nurture a 
brighter future out of the all too uneasy turmoil that often disheartens Santa 
Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 The meeting was organized by OCCCO, the Orange County Congregation Community 
Organization, a grass-roots association representing 50,000 families. It took 
place at St. Anne Catholic Church on Main Street. The building was brimming 
with people of all ages and resonated with the constant rustle of children. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents strained their attention as the meeting rolled back and forth from 
English to Spanish. Did anyone not belong there? Would the meeting have meant 
anything if there were such distinctions? This was not the mayor's meeting. Nor 
did the superintendent organize it. They were honored guests at a meeting 
convened by the residents. The questions: "Do they vote? Are they legal? Where 
do they come from?" were overridden by the more relevant question and its 
conspicuous answer: "Do they care?" Sitting in the midst of the congested 
congregation I can confidently say, "Yes, they do." 
</P>
<P>
 As I read about the meeting in the following day's papers I also noticed the 
stories on the recent commercials for Gov. Wilson's reelection running film 
clips of border-crossing scenarios with immigrants darting through the traffic 
desperately trying to get into the country. There was another story about the 
efforts to accumulate signatures for a possible anti-immigrant proposition for 
the November ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 In trying to comprehend this disparity it would be cliche and most inaccurate 
to speak about a polarized community divided between the haves and the 
have-nots, legals and undocumented, some modern rendition of "A Tale of Two 
Cities." 
</P>
<P>
 I have gradually become convinced that we live in a city with two tales. There 
are two ways to tell the story about what is happening to California and our 
own local communities here in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 One could say that things are coming apart or that things are coming together. 
Either option gives reason for fear and concern and yet neither is necessarily 
mutually exclusive of the other. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the shifting subterranean plates that undergird the Southland, our 
communities above ground are rearranging themselves, pulling together and 
pushing apart with stresses and strains that reverberate throughout the 
economy, our neighborhoods, schools and churches. 
</P>
<P>
 But unlike the massive fissures that swell and surge to the laws of 
geophysics, society creates its own laws and tries to match the rhythm of 
millions of different heads and hearts each filled with its own set of fears 
and aspirations. Will those laws pull us apart? Will they bring us together? 
Unlike the perpetually grinding plates we can choose and that choice each one 
must make in one's own mind. 
</P>
<P>
 Do we pull it apart or do we bring it together? Which option will prevail? 
</P>
<P>
 The meeting last month was made possible because thousands of people in 
congregations throughout Santa Ana have consistently made a preferential option 
to pull it together. By pulling together they hope to move aside mountains of 
fear and despair for the sake of clearing a path for the future. It is a sadly 
uncommon gesture in a society that would rather cast out people than its own 
fear. 
</P>
<P>
 The rising tremors of a November proposition against immigrants would further 
deepen the social fissures and erode the strength of this state. Local 
politicians seem to have lost their bearings in this shifting political terrain 
and would rather treat the mounting resentments as an inevitability as 
impossible to evade as "the Big One." 
</P>
<P>
 Propositions have become a clumsy excuse for the failure of our political 
leaders to deal with the challenges this state faces. Many of these 
mega-measures grasp at wild solutions while our communities and our children 
slip further out of our reach. They have become a political system without a 
face and without any accountability where shortsighted, ill-conceived remedies 
promoted by bumper stickers and sound bites substitute for sound public 
discourse and judgment. 
</P>
<P>
 That meeting of the congregations of OCCCO with the mayor and the school 
superintendent of Santa Ana offered a refreshing alternative. Rather than a 
group of people without hope reaching for apocalyptic outcomes, the Santa Ana 
churches, inspired by an apocalyptic hope, sought out practical outcomes that 
have been refined and tested through the heart-to-heart dialogues that make up 
the binding fiber of the organization. 
</P>
<P>
 Like much of what the churches believe, this is a tale that is heard best 
through our hymns: "There is no Jew or Greek. There is no slave or free. There 
is no woman or man; only heirs of the promise of God."

O.C. ART REVIEW; 'COMMODITY IMAGE' IS ON THE MONEY; THE LAGUNA EXHIBITION TAKES 
AN OBJECTIVE LOOK AT PHOTOGRAPHY'S ROLE IN CREATING OUR DESIRE TO SPEND, SPEND, 
SPEND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The consume-or-die 1980s were in large part about the seductive quality of 
images: ads pushing goods promising to satisfy every craving; large, loud and 
lavishly praised works of art believed to give their owners an aura of 
exclusivity; a U.S. President whose greatest skill was looking good on camera. 
</P>
<P>
 "Commodity Image," at the Laguna Art Museum (through July 24), investigates 
the leading role photography played in creating our fickle lust for objects. 
Organized by Willis Hartshorn, director of the International Center of 
Photography in New York, this show takes the broadest possible view of its 
subject, rather than condemning or glorifying it. 
</P>
<P>
 Some images on view actually helped foster the desire to spend, spend, spend. 
Others respond with satire, opportunistic glee or straightforward observation 
to the social and market forces that make rampant consumption possible. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbara Kruger, Richard Prince and Mitchell Syrop were obvious choices among 
the 37 artists, but the show also includes a few of Steven Meisel's photographs 
of Madonna from her "Sex" book, a group of those controversial Benneton ads 
plastered with images of death and disaster, works based on the sudden market 
appeal of Ansel Adams, and the extraordinary upper class social documents of 
Barbara Norfleet. 
</P>
<P>
 Certain sections of the show come off better than others, either because the 
images themselves are so insistently seductive and clever, or because they seem 
less overexposed (a risk one runs with such super-trendy material). For my, ah, 
money, "Celebrity, Sex and Glamour," "Photography in the Art Market," "The 
Image of Aristocracy" and "Work and Labor" are the most revealing categories. 
</P>
<P>
 Seeing the infamous Madonna images in the context of this show reinforces 
their overwhelming air of artifice. The singer-actress packages sex, one of the 
most uncontrolled human impulses, into a rigid container of stereotypes, 
without an inch of wiggle room. Posing in the nude on a suspiciously empty Los 
Angeles street, Madonna wears high-heeled mules, an expensive-looking 
'50s-style handbag and a bouffant hairdo. A "bad girl" cigarette is clamped 
suggestively between her lips. 
</P>
<P>
 By deliberately dating her look to the Stone Age of early Playboy magazine, 
she and photographer Meisel put quotation marks around the idea of sex. As in a 
drag act, the fun lies in the contrast between fantasy and reality. 
</P>
<P>
 "Celebrity, Sex and Glamour" includes photographer Jean Pigozzi's preening 
self-portraits, posed with the likes of Clint Eastwood and superstar model Elle 
Macpherson, which mimic the tiny snapshots from celebrity events plastered at 
the front of fashion magazines. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The drill involves lots of patently insincere smooching and hugging, a 
miniaturized yet power-packed image of high-level schmoozing, presented in a 
form that reassuringly mimics the reader's own Instamatic party snaps. In 
Pigozzi's universe, his mere presence among the glitterati gives him a 
Warholian 15 minutes of fame. Of course, the fame of models is fallout from 
consumer culture; in this context, it makes weird sense that the blank faces 
whose bodies sell the clothes, and promote the ineffable greatness of a 
designer name, are treated as the equals of people with actual talents. 
</P>
<P>
 "Photography in the Art Market" turns on the amazing fact that prints made in 
the 1970s of Ansel Adams' 1941 photograph "Moonrise, Hernandez, New Mexico" 
suddenly soared in value (from $1,300 to $16,500) late in the decade, when 
photography -- or at least, a certain subset of the medium -- was beginning to 
catch on as a "collectible." 
</P>
<P>
 Adams fans new to photography initially may have encountered the image 
improbably splayed on a Hills Bros. coffee can from 1969 -- also in the show. 
In any case, they may not have known or cared about big differences in tonal 
variation and sharpness of detail between a print Adams himself made in the 
'40s and gave to photo historian Beaumont Newhall, and a big batch prints of 
varying quality made three decades later from Adams' negative. (Viewers can 
compare such differences in the show -- although the "master image" is hung at 
an awkward distance from the other two.) 
</P>
<P>
 Artists' commentaries on the Adams phenomenon range from Jim Stone's 
heavy-handed "Pricerise" (a copy of the "Moonrise" print with a superimposed 
title and bar code) to Michael Bishop's "Aspirinrise," in which Adams' 
classical sense of grandeur bows to real-world exigencies: a smoggy daytime 
view of tacky buildings in scrubland, with white dots (aspirin tablets) rising 
into the sky. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Image of Aristocracy" portion of the show is its most unexpected 
component. Barbara Norfleet's quietly observant images of landed gentry (from 
her "All the Right People" series) reveal a striking uniformity of dress and 
bearing. Even in the dizzy '80s, they kept on wearing dull, "classic" clothes, 
eating sparse, unfashionable food and meeting for stylized rituals at country 
clubs, horse farms and yacht clubs. 
</P>
<P>
 This lifestyle was the image Ralph Lauren seized on for a line of clothing and 
housewares marketed to a vastly different group of people busy maxing out their 
credit cards. Dave Robbins' "Untitled (Horse and Rider)," a hugely magnified 
image of a polo player rather crudely embroidered on a shirt, in effect 
"deconstructs" the dated emblem of aristocracy that magically yuppifies 
menswear. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Then there is the "power" side of wealth: the titan of industry accustomed to 
total deference from underlings. In Tina Barney's photograph "The Trustee & the 
Curator," the setting is a museum gallery of Old Masters, with extension cords 
rigged presumably for a photo shoot. A balding young fellow in a gray sack suit 
raises one hand as if to mollify an impeccably tailored gray-haired man with 
patrician impatience etched around his mouth. 
</P>
<P>
 In the "Work and Labor" segment of the show, whether the subjects are drones 
in the featureless "clean room" of an industrial plant or paper-pushers in 
sterile bank offices, there is a pervasive feeling of disconnection from the 
world -- or even from the end result of a day's work. One set of images -- 
Sebastiao Selgado's photographs of hordes of sweaty, beast-of-burden gold 
miners in Brazil -- suggests that gilt may be a guilty pleasure. 
</P>
<P>
 Even in a show filled with conversation pieces, two works stand out as the 
alpha and omega of the "Commodity Culture" story: Barbara Kruger's "(Untitled) 
I'm Just Looking" and Sarah Charlesworth's "Gold." 
</P>
<P>
 Using a holograph-like form of photography and advertising techniques, Kruger 
superimposes the classic subterfuges of purveyor and consumer. From one angle, 
a merchant's hyperbolic boast ("Our prices are insane!") is superimposed on a 
huge, bloodied face that seems to have been appropriated from vintage Soviet 
film footage. From a different angle, this image is covered by blue lettering 
spelling out the polite shopper's hedge, "I'm just looking." 
</P>
<P>
 In Charlesworth's large-format photograph, gold objects float on a black 
background in a deliberately non-hierarchical way. In this gleaming universe, 
an ancient Egyptian shepherd's crook, a Greek coin, a Concord watch and a 
golden bathing suit all are created equal -- as stuff to salivate over, 
prompted by the forces of culture, greed, vanity and endless desire. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Commodity Image" continues through July 24 at the Laguna Art Museum, 307 
Cliff Drive, Laguna Beach. Hours: 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. Tuesdays through Sundays. 
Admission: $4 for adults, $3 for seniors and students, free for children under

MUSIC REVIEW; OJAI DIARY II: FESTIVAL FINALES, INTIMATE AND GRAND 
</P>

<P>
 The delirious festival in the rustic sun ended in a blaze of Stravinsky. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the grand finale on Sunday, however, Michael Tilson Thomas, the maestro 
in residence, repaid a few artistic debts. In the process, he reminded the 
adoring throng that little musical things can mean a lot. Not incidentally, he 
also offered a sampling of his own skill as a composer -- modest, as it turned 
out. 
</P>
<P>
 The diary continues. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday at 11 a.m.: At an hour when most civilized people are brunching, Libbey 
Bowl is crowded with hungry adventurers. They don't leave much sprawling room 
on the lawn behind the well-packed benches. The dress code is emphatically 
casual, on stage and off. The mood is as sunny as the weather. 
</P>
<P>
 The early-matinee attraction is a chamber-music program that cannily 
juxtaposes the soothing and the abrasive. Both concepts, of course, are 
relative. 
</P>
<P>
 The New World Brass Quintet opens the festivities with some stately Bach: 
"Contrapunctus I" from the "Kunst der Fuge," as transcribed by Robert King. The 
tuba booms the bass line in subterranean grace. 
</P>
<P>
 At the end of the program, the quintet returns to introduce Tilson Thomas' 
amiable "Street Song," a network of overlapping bluesy-clunky fanfares that 
seem to make much ado about little. The applause is polite, and the quintet 
responds with an exit encore: "Simple Gifts" as arranged by Rolf Smedvig for 
the Empire Brass. 
</P>
<P>
 The music in between makes interesting billfellows of Aaron Copland (Ojai 
class of '57, also '58 and '76), Toru Takemitsu, Franz Schubert and Luciano 
Berio. 
</P>
<P>
 Two faces of Copland are contrasted. First we see the lyrical, elegiac Copland 
of the Threnodies for Stravinsky (1971) and Beatrice Cunningham (1973), 
sensitively performed by youthful members of the New World Symphony. Here 
emotion, however subdued, triumphs over intellect. Later comes the agitated, 
abstract Copland of the Duo for flute and piano (1971), elegantly performed by 
Paula Robison and Timothy Hester. Here intellect triumphs over emotion. 
</P>
<P>
 Funereal images are further sustained with Takemitsu's "Itinerant" (1989), 
written in memory of Isamu Noguchi. Robison makes much of this stark, ethereal 
plaint, which is neatly counterbalanced by the dense, still-forbidding 
complexities of Berio's "Sequenza I" (1958). 
</P>
<P>
 The comforting centerpiece turns out to be Schubert's justly little-known 
Introduction and Variations on "Trock'ne Blumen" (1824). For reasons obscure, 
the composer turned this poignant song from "Die Schone Mullerin" into an 
endless and almost mindless virtuoso duet for flute and piano. It is undeniably 
pretty on the surface. The inherent sentiment is oddly trivialized, however, 
and the melodic impulses are dissected and decorated ad absurdum if not ad 
nauseam. 
</P>
<P>
 Undaunted, Robison and Hester play the quaint period piece as if all Schubert 
were great Schubert. It's the only way to go. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday at 5:30 p.m.: Benediction time. Tilson Thomas, who is about to take 
over the San Francisco Symphony, makes big valedictory gestures, figuratively 
and literally. 
</P>
<P>
 He opens with an imposing bow to the pioneering spirit of Edgard Varese, whose 
"Integrales" probably sound as cool, tough and modern today as they did when 
the composition was new in 1925. 
</P>
<P>
 Next, Tilson Thomas musters a sentimental nod in the direction of his late 
mentor, Ingolf Dahl (Ojai class of '57, also '64, '65 and '66). Much neglected 
though certainly not maligned, Dahl will probably be better remembered as a 
teacher than a composer. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Tower of Saint Barbara," written in 1954 for a ballet that was never 
performed, abounds in thoughtful historical references and interesting academic 
structures. Nevertheless, it ends up meandering in neo-romantic mush. 
</P>
<P>
 Tilson Thomas and his alert orchestra try bravely to undrip the droop. Still, 
there are limitations to what loyalty and devotion can do. 
</P>
<P>
 The mood improves after intermission with Astor Piazzolla's "Tangazo" (1969), 
an endearing exercise in languid Latin exotica. Here, incidentally, the 
festival authorities provide model program notes by Eric Salzman. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, for the climax of heroic climaxes, Tilson Thomas and friends offer an 
inspired performance of the Symphony in Three Movements by Igor Stravinsky 
(Ojai class of '55, also '56). The rhetoric skips and jaunts, breezes and 
bounces, rips and roars. 
</P>
<P>
 Every nuance is in its place. Nothing is exaggerated, nothing smudged. The 
detailing is subtle, the ultimate overview elemental. 
</P>
<P>
 After six demanding concerts packed into a period of only 47 hours, Stravinsky 
and Tilson Thomas finally provide a catharsis. It is uplifting. 
</P>
<P>
 It is reassuring. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Next year's festival will take place June 9, 10 and 11. Kent Nagano (Ojai 
class of '85, also '86) is to take over as music director, bringing with him 
his own opera orchestra from Lyons, France. After 47 years, Ojai goes 
international.

BAROQUE MUSIC FESTIVAL BEGINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIMOTHY MANGAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The 14th annual Baroque Music Festival Corona Del Mar got underway Sunday 
afternoon -- and this year, there is a difference. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Artistic director Burton Karson) has jumped on the bandwagon, so to speak, and 
for the first time has brought period instruments and historical performance 
practices to his weeklong festival. The opening concert, featuring six 
concertos and six soloists at St. Michael and All Angels Church, indicated that 
this is a promising development for the June-time series. 
</P>
<P>
 Essentially, Karson imported the services of the Los Angeles-based 
period-instrument ensemble Musica Angelica, thereby obtaining already finished 
goods. Indeed, the ensemble had performed some of the music on this concert, 
sans Karson, Friday and Saturday in other locations. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday's concert balanced concertos by the usual suspects -- Bach, Handel and 
Vivaldi -- with lesser-known pieces by Johann Joachim Quantz and John Stanley, 
and featured assured work by soloists and ensemble alike. 
</P>
<P>
 In Bach's familiar Harpsichord Concerto, BWV 1054, the splendid keyboardist 
was Yuko Tanaka, whose projection of line and rhythmical vigor gave real weight 
to her interpretation. She also produced a singing phrase as convincing as one 
is likely to hear on a harpsichord. 
</P>
<P>
 Archlutenist Michael Eagan) gave a quiet, gentle (and discreetly amplified) 
account of Vivaldi's Lute Concerto, RV 93, highlighted by his tasteful, florid 
embellishments of the beautiful slow movement melody. 
</P>
<P>
 Stephen Schultz) offered a strong performance on Baroque flute of Quantz's 
Concerto in G, showing the instrument in all of its fluid, rich, resonant 
light, though his effort seemed somewhat wasted on this workaday music. 
</P>
<P>
 It also didn't quite seem worth acquiring photocopies of Stanley's Organ 
Concerto No. 1 from the British Library, but organist Patricia Murphy Lamb) 
played it solidly and gracefully. 
</P>
<P>
 Vivaldi's Cello Concerto, RV 418, with Mark Chatfield) proving to be a rugged, 
expressive soloist, and Handel's Concerto Grosso, Opus 3, No. 3, with Schultz, 
Chatfield, Tanaka and violinist David Wilson in the limelight, rounded out the 
event. Karson led sensitive and polished accompaniments throughout, and the 
period instruments sounded especially full in the chapel's acoustic.

FAMILY; 'OTHER SIDE' EXPLORES A COMMUNICATION BARRIER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNNE HEFFLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If you can hear, you know that sound can be beautiful, but can you imagine the 
beauty of pure silence? 
</P>
<P>
 In "The Other Side of the Voice," "Silent is beautiful," writes Sandra 
DeDois', one of several young students ages 12 to 15 who have written several 
short theatrical works, both funny and serious, which will be performed at the 
Fountain Theatre on Sunday. It is the culmination of a special performing arts 
program at Bancroft Junior High, conducted by stage and screen professionals 
for students who cannot hear. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most public schools do have performing arts programs, but they never include 
the deaf students," said artistic director Bob Hilterman, whose credits include 
the film version of "Children of a Lesser God" and the CBS television movie 
"Bridge to Silence." 
</P>
<P>
 "I am hard of hearing and I had a communication barrier (in school) when I was 
growing up," he said. He learned then that performing was a good way to "get 
applause and a pat on the back." 
</P>
<P>
 Hilterman developed the performing arts program in 1991 to help children 
overcome that same communication barrier. Funded by the California Arts Council 
and the Plum Foundation, it will expand to more schools next year. 
</P>
<P>
 "This program helps the students get peers' attention and develops their 
confidence," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 It also serves as a language and writing motivator. Under the guidance of 
Hilterman and other deaf professionals, including comedian C. J. Jones, the 
students' creative efforts ranged from romance to fantasy and particularly, 
comedy. 
</P>
<P>
 Hilterman has had his own frustrations as a performer in film. "When a deaf 
man's character comes up," he said, "a hearing man plays the role." He hopes 
that hearing audiences who come to the show will appreciate not only the beauty 
and eloquence of signing, but "that a deaf person is no different than a 
hearing person." 
</P>
<P>
 The free show will be performed in American Sign Language with voice 
interpretation. 
</P>
<P>
 * "The Other Side of the Voice," Fountain Theatre, 5060 Fountain Ave., 
Hollywood, Sunday at 1 and 3 p.m., free; (213) 663-1525.  
</P>
<P>
 * You Won't Get in Trouble: Kids can chalk up the sidewalk and nobody'll yell 
at "On the Square," the AIDS Service Center's fund-raising street festival of 
the arts, Saturday and Sunday in Pasadena City Hall's Centennial Square from 
noon until dusk. 
</P>
<P>
 While grown-ups watch 200 artists at work, munch "international cuisine" or 
catch a variety of music and dance performances, kids can create their own fine 
art masterpieces, including sidewalk chalk drawings, or they can decorate angel 
wings, play dress-up and groove to a bunch of entertainment provided just for 
them, from veteran storytellers such as Milbre Burch to the We Tell Stories 
theater-in-a-trunk troupe. 
</P>
<P>
 Festival admission is $5 and a two-day pass is $7.50, but children under 12 
who come with an adult are free.

MUSIC REVIEW; MASTER CHORALE ENDS SEASON WITH 'CARMINA' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEWIS SEGAL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For its final concert of the season, Sunday at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, 
the Los Angeles Master Chorale and Sinfonia Orchestra ventured a two-part 
meditation on the ephemeral nature of human happiness: Brahms' "Nanie" and 
Orff's "Carmina Burana." 
</P>
<P>
 Preceding these challenges, however, conductor Paul Salamunovich offered the 
audience a curiously familiar novelty: Elinor Remick Warren's "Our Beloved 
Land," a choral anthem that the late composer had expanded from her 16-measure 
chime-theme (originally commissioned for Hollywood Bowl) that Pavilion 
audiences hear before all concerts and during intermissions to call them to 
their seats. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the Brahms lament (set to a poem by Schiller), it was sung sumptuously, 
without bombast. But odd hesitations in both pieces, and the utter subjugation 
of the orchestra in the latter, flawed performances that otherwise achieved 
ideal choral balances and rich tone. 
</P>
<P>
 High-speed passages in the Orff displayed the Chorale's spectacular clarity of 
attack, but deliberate-unto-stodgy tempo choices elsewhere and a general lack 
of forward momentum kept Salamunovich's interpretation strangely passive in 
this most dynamic of choral showpieces. 
</P>
<P>
 Occasionally, an odd sense of fragmentation intruded -- as if everyone were 
singing random syllables -- but the great male chorus at the end of the Tavern 
section boasted genuine expressive power among its distinctions. 
</P>
<P>
 The crucial baritone duties fell to Zheng Zhou, effortful in the early Tavern 
stanzas, forceful and secure in the Abbot's hymn to drink, but dry to utter 
tonelessness in the amorous "O, o, o, totus floreo" interjections of the "Court 
of Love" section. 
</P>
<P>
 Kerry O'Brien sang with consistent purity of tone, though the high notes in 
her final, rhapsodic "Ducissime, totam tibi subdo me!" clearly were hard won. 
Bruce Johnson made a plaintive, tremulous Roasted Swan, even managing to 
suggest that the burnt fowl savored the irony of his predicament. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Children's Chorus added to the lushness of the performance but 
the orchestra, once again, sounded pallid much of the time. A handsome program 
insert supplied texts and translations for the Brahms and Orff 
compositions.LEWIS SEGAL

HOWARD ROSENBERG: A MOSTLY POSITIVE 'CENTURY' OF WOMEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Howard Rosenberg 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Eulogies inevitably inflate their subjects, sometimes almost beyond 
recognition. Thus, when Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis died last month, "remarkable 
woman" was the stamp affixed to her in homage after homage. 
</P>
<P>
 Why remarkable? Well, her admirers say, she was an elegant, great-dressing 
First Lady who responded bravely to the murder of her husband, raising two 
swell kids in the process. Yes, just as countless other spouses of murder 
victims have carried on. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, the argument goes, she could have lived off her wealth, but instead 
chose later in life to work at a job in publishing. Yes, just as other widows 
work outside the home. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, she had style. Yes, and unlike other Americans, 100 million bucks to 
indulge it. 
</P>
<P>
 This is not to diminish Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, who surely had many 
admirable qualities, only to urge against loosely conferring the term greatness 
. For a glimpse of the truly remarkable, tune in the TBS cable production "A 
Century of Women," an entertaining, high-aiming, three-night biography of U.S. 
women, some of which rises to the epic level of those landmark PBS 
documentaries "Civil War" and "Eyes on the Prize (I and II)." 
</P>
<P>
 For much of this century, women were relegated to a sort of benign servitude 
on the white man's plantation. Men have set the agendas for women in this 
real-life "Father Knows Best," their paternalism reaching even to small, subtle 
things that society takes for granted, such as men being the ones who drive the 
family car and lead in ballroom dancing. And too often, women have allowed 
themselves to be defined by men, such as blustery Rush Limbaugh's snide 
labeling of radical feminists as "feminazis." 
</P>
<P>
 Not this time, though. 
</P>
<P>
 "A Century of Women" is not only about women, but also mostly by women, with 
Jacoba Atlas as executive producer, Sylvia Morales, Judy Korin and Christen 
Harty Schaefer directing the documentary portions and Barbara Kopple directing 
fictional family sequences that are used to bridge various topics. 
</P>
<P>
 With Jane Fonda narrating, "A Century of Women" unfurls its story with vintage 
film, testimony from historians and other prominent women, along with diaries, 
letters and personal memoirs of important female figures whose words are read 
off-camera by a collection of fine actresses, ranging from Jodie Foster to 
Meryl Streep. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite occasional soapbox tendencies and a few striking omissions, "A Century 
of Women" is largely a shining, valuable survey, one affirming that a 
documentary needn't sacrifice smarts and scholarship to align itself with the 
mainstream of TV's pop culture. The only real bummers here are Kopple's 
gratingly intrusive, cloying, just-too-precious fictional pit stops, with 
Teresa Wright, Olympia Dukakis, Talia Shire, Justine Bateman, Brooke Smith, 
Madge Sinclair and Jasmine Guy cast in awkwardly conceived roles that are 
supposed to flesh out common denominators and generational gaps among women. 
Good cast, bad idea. 
</P>
<P>
 On to different ideas. The first diaphragm? The first bra? The first First 
Lady who became an influential social reformer (Eleanor Roosevelt)? They're all 
here, along with the story of labor crusader Pauline Newman (the voice of Amy 
Irving), who survived the shocking working conditions and 1911 fire at the 
notorious Triangle Shirtwaist Factory in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 The latter episode opens tonight's two-hour premiere, directed by Morales and 
titled "Work and Family." We hear from labor reformer Elizabeth Gurley Flynn 
(Sally Field) and Charlotte Perkins Gilman (Candice Bergen), a shocking radical 
who suggests there is life for women beyond domestic chores, and from Christine 
Frederick (Mary Steenburgen). She was the mother of what became known as home 
economics, the system that helped mechanize a woman's work in the home. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, World War II turns homemakers into factory workers, but when the 
war ends, so do the jobs, and women are advised by men to get their priorities 
straight and return to "the fascinating business of making a home." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Part 2 ("Sexuality and Social Justice"), directed by Korin, is both the most 
fascinating and the most irritating of the two-hour segments, with the likes of 
jazz-age poet Edna St. Vincent Millay (Blythe Danner), birth-control pioneer 
Margaret Sanger (Streep), suffragette Alice Paul (Foster) and Mississippi 
voter-registration leader Fannie Lou Hamer sharing time with author Erica Jong 
and sex surveyor Shere Hite. 
</P>
<P>
 There's a jolting TV interview here -- revolutionary for 1957 -- with Sanger 
blasting the Catholic church's male hierarchy for opposing birth control: 
"They're celibates. They don't know love. They don't know marriage. They don't 
know anything about bringing up children, or any of the marriage problems of 
life, and yet they speak to people as if they were God." 
</P>
<P>
 As for irritating, the Supreme Court's landmark Roe vs. Wade decision is 
depicted as a triumph for women wanting control over their own bodies. Fine. 
Yet the anti-abortion crowd is afforded no suffrage on this program.  
</P>
<P>
 Even while skillfully presenting the flowers of artist Georgia O'Keeffe as an 
erotic metaphor for full creative expression by women, Schaefer's Part 3 
("Image and Popular Culture") is otherwise the flimsiest of the segments. For 
example, it overvalues the influence of Lucille Ball and her ditsy Lucy Ricardo 
character in "I Love Lucy" as role models for U.S. women while understressing 
the relentless, long-term anti-female bias practiced by mainstream television. 
On target, though, is the touting of ABC's "Roseanne" as a powerful positive 
force. 
</P>
<P>
 In the main, so is this documentary. 
</P>
<P>
 * "A Century of Women" airs tonight, Wednesday and Thursday at 5:05 p.m. and 
9:05 p.m. each evening.

WINNING THE HARD WAY; EL CAMINO REAL CLAIMS TITLE AGAIN AFTER BLOWING 6-1 LEAD, 
SURVIVING IN 9 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNEDY COSGROVE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>

<P>
 El Camino Real High won a dramatic City Section 4-A Division championship, 
defeating rival Chatsworth, 7-6, in nine innings Monday at Dodger Stadium to 
claim its second consecutive title. 
</P>
<P>
 El Camino Real (23-7) also had defeated Chatsworth, 7-6, in last season's 
championship game. It was the first time a team won two consecutive City titles 
since Granada Hills in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, El Camino Real took a 6-1 lead into the seventh inning but 
Chatsworth scored five runs in the top of the seventh inning to force extra 
innings. However, two innings later, Conquistadores' catcher Steve Riback 
scored on Ray Daryabigi's throwing error to end it. 
</P>
<P>
 "It may not have been the prettiest game, but it was an uphill fight, a 
hard-fought game all around," El Camino Real Coach Mike Maio said. "Both teams 
played well." 
</P>
<P>
 El Camino Real first baseman Craig Carlton had three hits, including the final 
one. He singled to center in the ninth to advance Riback to third and when 
Daryabigi's throw squirted past catcher Brandon Murphy, Riback sprinted home. 
</P>
<P>
 "Coach Maio said to get a good, quality at-bat," Carlton said. "That's what I 
tried to do." 
</P>
<P>
 But the game did not appear like it would be close. 
</P>
<P>
 For six innings, El Camino Real High pitcher Randy Wolf huffed and he puffed 
and he blew Chatsworth batters down. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Chancellors, who managed only one hit against Wolf through six 
innings, exploded in the seventh. 
</P>
<P>
 "It didn't look very good for us," Murphy said. "But we've been there before, 
and we almost pulled off a miracle." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed. After all, Wolf (12-3) before Monday's game had allowed only two runs 
in his previous 33 playoff innings over the past two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 But with one out, Chatsworth suddenly began tagging last season's City player 
of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chancellors rapped out four hits and benefited from two El Camino Real 
errors to forge a 6-6 tie. The final two runs of the inning scored on an error 
by shortstop Matt Tays, who moved to his left to field a ground ball up the 
middle by Murphy, but the ball skipped off his glove into center field. 
</P>
<P>
 That came one batter after Chatsworth's Rod Daryabigi scored on El Camino Real 
center fielder Justin Martin's throwing error. 
</P>
<P>
 But Wolf, who pitched all nine innings and allowed six hits, three earned runs 
and had nine strikeouts, survived the seventh. He was named the MVP of the 
playoffs, winning three games and saving the other. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was the most amazing game I've ever played in," Wolf said. "It was so 
incredible. I always knew we would win because this team has so much heart." 
</P>
<P>
 Chatsworth's Oscar Bocanegra (5-2) was the hard-luck loser, allowing three 
hits and no earned runs in six innings in relief of starter Jim DeBiase. 
</P>
<P>
 The game looked to be over after the Chancellors (28-5) surrendered five runs 
in a nightmarish first inning during which their normally solid defense fell 
apart. 
</P>
<P>
 With two men on and one out, Carlton drove in Martin with a single to left to 
make it 1-0. 
</P>
<P>
 Billy Burnette followed with a two-run double to left-center field to give the 
Conquistadores a three-run cushion. But they weren't through, thanks to 
Chatsworth mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
 After Tays reached base on an error, Burnette scored on a passed ball. Tays 
then scored on a throwing error by shortstop Bryan LaCour to make it 5-0. 
</P>
<P>
 DeBiase endured his second consecutive rough outing, lasting only 2 2/3 
innings. 
</P>
<P>
 El Camino Real added a run in the third inning when Tays' long double to 
left-center field drove in Joey Maiden from first base. 
</P>
<P>
 Chatsworth scored a run in the third inning when Wolf balked with the bases 
loaded. 
</P>
<P>
 Wolf escaped a jam in the ninth by retiring the side after Chatsworth had a 
runner on second base and no outs.

FIGHTING THE BATTLE OF HIS LIFE, BROCK INSPIRES HIS TROOPS; BASEBALL: ARIZONA 
STATE PLAYERS TRY TO KEEP WINNING AT COLLEGE WORLD SERIES BECAUSE THEY BELIEVE 
GAME KEEPS ALIVE THEIR COACH, WHO HAS CANCER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The lucky lawn chair returned to the corner of the Arizona State dugout Monday 
night, but its normal occupant, Sun Devil Coach Jim Brock, did not. 
</P>
<P>
 Brock, the team's inspirational leader during Arizona State's postseason run, 
was back at his hotel, fighting yet another round of what he calls "the battle 
of my life," while the emotion-charged Sun Devils suffered a 4-3, 11-inning 
loss to Oklahoma. 
</P>
<P>
 The 57-year-old coach who has won two national championships (1977 and '81) 
and 1,099 games and has made 13 College World Series appearances, was diagnosed 
with liver cancer after the 1993 Series. 
</P>
<P>
 He underwent surgery to remove 80% of his liver and several inches of his 
colon last July, and spent much of this season coping with the fevers, chills 
and listlessness caused by chemotherapy. 
</P>
<P>
 Once a robust, outspoken man known for his ferocity -- both on and off the 
field -- Brock has lost some 40 pounds in the last month and was suffering from 
jaundice when the Sun Devils arrived for this year's Series.  
</P>
<P>
 He spent the entire Mideast Regional in Knoxville, Tenn., and Saturday's 
Series-opening victory over Miami in the lawn chair in the dugout while 
assistant coaches Bill Kinneberg and John Pierson handled the team. 
</P>
<P>
 Fellow coaches, shocked at how frail Brock looked, worried that he might not 
live through this week, and Brock, who brought several close friends with him 
on the trip, gave them a good scare Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Overcome by 88-degree heat and feeling nauseous from new medication, Brock 
decided in the Rosenblatt Stadium parking lot that he couldn't make it through 
the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Brock's daughter, Cathi, drove him back to Arizona State's hotel while the 
lawn chair, which a Sun Devil booster brought from Knoxville to Omaha, remained 
in the dugout, serving as a monument of sorts to Brock's spirit. 
</P>
<P>
 "We thought if we left it there, a little bit of him would be there," said 
Arizona State second baseman Todd Delnoce, a fifth-year senior from Foothill 
High School. "For some reason it didn't work." 
</P>
<P>
 Sun Devil sports information director Mark Brand said Brock, who has had 64 
former players, including Reggie Jackson and Barry Bonds, make the major 
leagues, was "resting comfortably at his hotel and watching the game," on 
television Monday night. The Sun Devils will play Miami tonight in an 
elimination game. 
</P>
<P>
 "His absence scared us a bit and inspired us a lot," Delnoce said. 
</P>
<P>
 A tour of this year's Series field reveals an assortment of motivational 
stories: Cal State Fullerton has its usual we-don't-get-any-respect chip on its 
shoulder. Georgia Tech, making its first Series appearance, is trying to prove 
it belongs among college baseball's elite. Florida State is shooting for its 
first national title after 12 fruitless trips to Omaha. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there's Arizona State, which wants to keep winning so its coach can keep 
living. Several Sun Devil players believe baseball has sustained Brock and are 
concerned that the end of his 23rd season will stifle Brock's will to live. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the thought in a lot of guys' heads," Delnoce said. "Once the season 
is over it's going to be harder for him to fight." 
</P>
<P>
 Delnoce, a former three-sport standout at Foothill, is probably closer to 
Brock than any other Sun Devil player. He sat out most of this season because 
of torn knee ligaments, but instead of undergoing season-ending surgery, he 
elected to let the knee heal and hope for the best. The former walk-on returned 
to the starting lineup at the regionals. 
</P>
<P>
 Brock's intensity, his hard-driving work ethic, is what makes it so difficult 
for opposing coaches to fathom Brock managing from a lawn chair. It's like 
General Patton commanding his troops from a La-Z-Boy. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's been a fierce, vicious competitor and has represented his university 
with every ounce of fiber in his body ," Fullerton Coach Augie Garrido said. 
"No one has put more into his job than Jim Brock." 
</P>
<P>
 Garrido and Brock were the central figures in one of college baseball's most 
heated rivalries in the early 1980s. Brock had one of the nation's premier 
programs; Garrido, who won his first national title in 1979, was trying to move 
in on Brock's turf. 
</P>
<P>
 The rivalry peaked in 1982, when Fullerton upset top-ranked and defending 
national champion Arizona State in the regionals at Tempe, Ariz. A Brock quote, 
that Fullerton "was just a bunch of guys named Joe," made its way to Garrido. 
</P>
<P>
 Garrido had batting practice jerseys, each with the name "Joe" on back, made 
for his players, and when he brought the lineup card out for a game against the 
Sun Devils, he used "Joe" as a first name for each Titan player. 
</P>
<P>
 Brock's remarks fired up the Titans. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was nothing personal between Jim and I," Garrido said. "We were just 
trying to get to their level and fighting to do the job. If anything, I was 
jealous because they were so good." 
</P>
<P>
 Since being diagnosed with cancer, Brock said he has grown much closer to his 
family. In recent interviews, he seemed surprised that so many people, some 
whom he thought were enemies, have expressed concern for his health. He 
expressed regret over some of his inflammatory comments. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm kind of an enigma," Brock said last Friday during practice. "I can be 
kind of funny, kind of entertaining, and people can hang on my every word. But 
I can also turn people off in a big way. I have to live with both sides of 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 Brock also wished he wouldn't have placed so much emphasis on his career over 
the years. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's almost like this year I've been able to sit back and see the forest," 
Brock said. "In the past, all I saw were the trees." 
</P>
<P>
 Sitting in a lawn chair during college baseball's showcase event might not be 
Brock's idea of coaching. 
</P>
<P>
 But you can't beat the view.

COLLEGE WORLD SERIES NOTES / LON EUBANKS; TITANS, GARRIDO FACE ANOTHER MUST-WIN 
GAME TODAY AGAINST SEMINOLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LON EUBANKS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Augie Garrido is relishing this College World Series now. The Cal State 
Fullerton coach is back on a high after Sunday night's 20-6 Titan victory over 
Louisiana State. 
</P>
<P>
 The next stop comes at 12:36 p.m. (PDT) today, when the Titans take on Florida 
State in another game that could mean the end of the line. 
</P>
<P>
 But nothing was at stake in a light workout Monday, and Garrido was enjoying 
the banter with his players around the batting cage. He was kidding and joking, 
keeping things light. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've got enough kid in me that I really still enjoy doing this," said 
Garrido, 55, whose coaching career began in 1966 at Sierra High School in 
Tollhouse, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
 "I could do some other things, but I have commitments to kids here now that I 
wouldn't step away from, and I feel as though I still relate well with college 
players." 
</P>
<P>
 Garrido, of course, would like to win this national championship for reasons 
of his own. He has won two national titles and six NCAA regional titles. Only 
four coaches have won three or more national championships. 
</P>
<P>
 But more important to him, he says, are his players. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I get more caught up in where they are, in their ups and downs 
emotionally, than some coaches maybe do," Garrido said. "But that's the kind of 
coach I am. That's what I like about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Garrido believes he has retained a teacher's mind-set. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to see the best of what's inside all these players come out," Garrido 
said. "I want them to capture for themselves everything that can come from this 
experience. When they get this far, they have to put more into this than 
anything else they've ever done in their lives. They'll come out of this with a 
whole different level of self-esteem." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Garrido is at his best in this kind of situation, going against big-name 
schools loaded with All-Americans and first-round draft choices. 
</P>
<P>
 He can counter with coaching strategy and devil-may-care baseball. A bunt 
here, a hit-and-run there, and suddenly the Titans have picked your pocket. 
</P>
<P>
 It was interesting how important all these elements were in producing Sunday 
night's 11-run first inning. Well-placed bunts, not wall-rattling hits, got the 
Titans in high gear. 
</P>
<P>
 "We ask that of all our players, to be able to bunt when we need that," 
Garrido said. "They all understand it. They know that if we ask Dante Powell to 
bunt the ball, then they know we expect them to be able to do the same thing." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Soon it will be crunch time again. Garrido and associate head coach George 
Horton will weigh carefully their moves. Who to pitch? Has Powell bounced back 
enough from his hamstring injury last week to be at something approaching full 
strength?  
</P>
<P>
 Horton is leaning toward left-hander Chad Rolish (7-4) to start today because 
Florida State has solid left-handed hitting. Right-hander Dan Ricabal (11-1) 
will come in if Rolish falters. Florida State is expected to counter with 
left-hander Charlie Cruz, 3-3 with a 1.98 earned-run average. 
</P>
<P>
 That would leave Mike Parisi (11-4) fresh for a Thursday game against Georgia 
Tech, unbeaten in the Series, if the Titans get past the Seminoles. Parisi has 
pitched well twice against Tech. He gave up four hits in the regular-season 
game, winning, 2-0. He allowed five hits in 7 1/3 innings in the series opener 
Friday against Tech, but lost, 2-0. 
</P>
<P>
 Continued improvement by Powell also was a boost to the Titans Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dante looks better today than he did yesterday, so we're encouraged by that," 
Garrido said. 
</P>
<P>
 World Series Notes 
</P>
<P>
 The Fullerton-Florida State game is scheduled to be televised live on ESPN. . 
. . Titan relief pitcher Ted Silva suffered a slight cut on the first finger of 
his pitching hand when his hand hit Dan Ricabal's cleat while the two were 
warming-up side by side Friday. Silva says he's fine now.

LOCAL NOTES: MATER DEI CATCHER TREANOR SIGNS WITH ROYALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS FOSTER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Matt Treanor, a catcher from Mater Dei High School, opened a bank account 
Monday, two days after he signed with the Kansas City Royals. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't have much money before, but I expect it will be coming in now," 
Treanor said. 
</P>
<P>
 Treanor was a fourth-round selection Thursday in baseball's amateur draft. He 
becomes the first Mater Dei player to sign directly out of high school since 
Bob Ickes became coach 20 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was a little worried that the scouts might shy away from me because of 
that," Treanor said. "I thought they might not draft me very high." 
</P>
<P>
 Treanor, who said he signed for a little less than $100,000, hit .368 with 
three home runs and 23 runs batted in. He has been assigned to the Royals' 
rookie league team in Ft. Myers, Fla. CHRIS FOSTER

ALL-COUNTY BADMINTON PLAYERS OF THE YEAR; THERE'S NO STOPPING PAK, POYYAK THIS 
SUMMER; BOYS: DEDICATION AND NOSE-TO-GRINDSTONE ATTITUDE MAKE THE DIFFERENCE 
FOR CORONA DEL MAR JUNIOR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANE HUANG, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Off the court, Corona del Mar's Jerome Poyyak is easy-going and fun. 
</P>
<P>
 On the court, it's a different matter. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I play, I'm hard-headed and stubborn," said Poyyak, The Times Orange 
County boys' badminton player of the year. "I get serious because I want to 
win. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dr. Jekyll-Mr. Hyde act has worked successfully for the junior this 
season. He finished with a 28-2 singles record, reached the semifinals of the 
Southern Section individuals and won the Alhambra Tournament title. In team 
competition, Poyyak was undefeated in the playoffs, leading the Sea Kings to 
the semifinals of the Division I playoffs. They lost to eventual champion 
Alhambra Keppel. 
</P>
<P>
 However, there's no time to relish or relax. Poyyak is already preparing for 
next season. Only a week after the season ended for the Sea Kings, he returned 
to the gym. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm trying to get a few more of the players to keep playing with me over the 
summer," Poyyak said. "I want to see if some people will enter (summer) 
tournaments with me. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to keep playing because next year I want to win." 
</P>
<P>
 For someone as laid-back as Poyyak, his dedication to badminton is almost 
surprising. 
</P>
<P>
 "He doesn't take a lot of things seriously, but badminton is one of the things 
that he does," teammate Kristy Macfarland said. "He wants to do so well." 
</P>
<P>
 Poyyak became interested in badminton during his sophomore year and he reached 
the semifinals of the Southern Section tournament. After that season, he began 
training seriously with Sea King assistant coach Chau Nguyen, the 1992 Southern 
Section singles champion from Estancia. 
</P>
<P>
 "The thing that motivated me was after I started training, I noticed the big 
difference in my game and I wanted to see how far I could go in the sport," 
Poyyak said. 
</P>
<P>
 At first, Poyyak had difficulty getting other players to take him seriously. 
Few non-Asians have dominated the sport. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because I'm white (other players) don't take me seriously," Poyyak said. "If 
I play well, they will take me seriously. I want to show that it's not a 
one-race sport." 
</P>
<P>
 Another hurdle for Poyyak is his academic performance. He was academic 
ineligibility the first part of this season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess I was really excited to play this season and I didn't really think 
about my grades," Poyyak said. "I was thinking about practicing and playing." 
</P>
<P>
 So there will be not one, but two things on Poyyak's agenda during the 
off-season. 
</P>
<P>
 "My goal is to get good grades and play every tournament," Poyyak said. "I 
want it to be easy for me next year. I don't want anyone to even come close to 
me." All-County Badminton Team

ALL-COUNTY BADMINTON PLAYERS OF THE YEAR; THERE'S NO STOPPING PAK, POYYAK THIS 
SUMMER; GIRLS: AFTER A DIFFICULT TRANSITION FROM DOUBLES, GARDEN GROVE JUNIOR 
HAS COME ON STRONG IN SINGLES.

<P>
 Summer is the time when badminton players can leave the confines of the 
gymnasium and venture to the great outdoors. Well, at least most of them. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no time rest period for Garden Grove's Judy Pak, The Times Orange 
County girls' badminton player of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 A week after leading the Argonauts to the Southern Section Division I finals, 
the junior was readying her racket for the string of summer junior tournaments 
that start in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to play during the summer because it's really fun," Pak said. 
</P>
<P>
 And the other reason: 
</P>
<P>
 "My goal is to be the CIF champion (next year)," Pak said, "so I think I 
should continue to play to improve." 
</P>
<P>
 Pak already has made great strides this season. During her first two seasons 
for the Argonauts, she played only doubles. 
</P>
<P>
 Last season, Pak and her partner made it to the semifinals at the Southern 
Section individual tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 But this season, the Argonauts needed Pak where she could have an effect -- at 
No. 1 singles. 
</P>
<P>
 "Judy is a dominant player," Argonaut Coach Vicki Toutz said. "She's a lot 
stronger than any of the other girls' player I have. (Having her play singles), 
she can score two points in a match." 
</P>
<P>
 The adjustment from doubles to singles was difficult for Pak. 
</P>
<P>
 "In doubles you are playing with your partner and only have to work half the 
court," Pak said. "In singles you have to cover the whole court and must rely a 
lot more on your footwork. The first time I played, it was really hard and I 
got really tired. Later on I got better." 
</P>
<P>
 In her first season at singles, Pak was good enough to post a 46-8 record, win 
the Garden Grove League individual title, reach the second round of the 
Southern Section individuals and lead the Argonauts to the team finals. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first three rounds of the playoffs, Pak was undefeated in singles with 
two crucial victories in the Argonauts' 10-9 semifinal victory over La Puente 
Nogales. 
</P>
<P>
 However, at the team finals May 25, Pak's inexperience at singles showed. She 
lost both matches to Alhambra Keppel's Annie Tran and Nhi Phung. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was apparent when Judy played Keppel that there are some weaknesses in her 
game," Toutz said. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite it all, Pak is pleased with performance this season. 
</P>
<P>
 "To me this was a very successful season," she said. "Last year we had a 
stronger team than this year but everyone tried really hard and we made it to 
the finals, so I think we were really successful." 
</P>
<P>
 And for herself? 
</P>
<P>
 "I was very happy with the season because this is my first year playing 
singles. I didn't expect to win league and go to CIF." 
</P>
<P>
 Anyway, she has the entire summer to prepare for next season. All-County

CIF-SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA GOLF ASSN. TOURNAMENT; SUNNY HILLS' LEE RALLIES TO 
KNOCK OFF BOOTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN BECK, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 With two holes to go in the CIF-Southern California Golf Assn. individual 
girls' championship Monday, Jenny Lee was in a tough spot. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee, a junior from Sunny Hills, was a stroke behind Santa Margarita's Kellee 
Booth, the two-time defending CIF-SCGA champion and winner of the 1993 USGA 
Girls' Championship. 
</P>
<P>
 Prime time for wilting? Not for Lee. 
</P>
<P>
 She made birdies on the final two holes at Redlands Country Club to finish 
with a one-over-par 74, one stroke ahead of Booth. 
</P>
<P>
 The two birdies completed Lee's remarkable comeback. After falling as many as 
four shots back on the front nine, she shot four-under 33 on the back. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee's score is even more impressive because she played 36 holes Monday, also 
playing in the morning team competition. 
</P>
<P>
 In the morning, she shot seven-over 77 from the boys' tees to help Sunny 
Hills, the Southern Section champion, finish fifth with a 392 total. 
</P>
<P>
 Palm Desert, which lost a playoff to Sunny Hills for the section title two 
weeks ago, won with 376. Five Palm Desert players shot at least 78. Runner-up 
Poway had 380. 
</P>
<P>
 Poway's Charley Hoffman won the boys' title, shooting two-under 68, three 
strokes better than second-place Ryan King of Vista Rancho Buena Vista and 
third-place Jeremy Whiting of Palm Desert. 
</P>
<P>
 Tustin's Jimmy Lee, the top Orange County finisher, was fourth by matching 
cards with six others after shooting 73. 
</P>
<P>
 With four holes remaining, Lee was one-under. But he finished with a 
double-bogey, two bogeys and a par. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Margarita's Ben Bost, Esperanza's Chris Berry and Sunny Hills' Jin Park 
each shot 74 and were in an eight-way tie for 10th. Sunny Hills' Terry Noe shot 
75. 
</P>
<P>
 Those scores were low for Sunny Hills in the team competition; four Lancers 
shot 77 or better. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunny Hills Coach Tim Devaney said he believed a score of about 390 would put 
a team in the running for the title. The course, although short at par 70 and 
6,276 yards from the boys' tees, is tight and the greens are large and fast. As 
it turned out, four teams broke 390 and seven of the 10 broke 400. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fact that (Palm Desert) shot 376 . . . that's a good score," Devaney 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 After a break of about an hour, Jenny Lee, the only girl to play in the 
morning, teed off with three fresh players. "I was tired on the front nine," 
she said. "I couldn't even walk." 
</P>
<P>
 But Lee said she was rejuvenated on the par-5 ninth hole when her 50-foot 
eagle attempt stopped next to the cup. After she tapped in for birdie, she was 
only three shots behind Booth. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee, a South Korea native who moved to Fullerton from Hawaii in November, 
caught Booth on the 17th with a nine-foot birdie putt. Booth's eight-footer 
nicked the lip of the hole. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had confidence," Lee said. "I feel like I can make any putts. Just hit 
them." 
</P>
<P>
 On the par-5 18th, Lee hit her second shot about 18 feet from the flag and 
two-putted for birdie. Booth hit her second to the back rough, chipped 15 feet 
short and missed the birdie putt. 
</P>
<P>
 Booth, a senior who will play for Arizona State next fall, said it was a good 
battle. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love competition," Booth said. "It's basically why I play. It's just 
annoying when you're missing putts and she's making them." 
</P>
<P>
 Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Southern Section champion Tiger Woods of Western did not compete because he 
was playing a practice round for the PGA Tour event that starts Thursday in 
Rye, N.Y. . . . In the boys' individual, Servite's Jeff McGraw shot 76, Corona 
del Mar's Bill Sarracino and Huntington Beach's Greg Uberuaga had 81s and 
Trabuco Hills' Kevin Rogers shot 82. . . . Corona del Mar's Jenny Glasgow shot 
83 in the girls' individual.

RAMS LAND FORMER RAIDER HESTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T.J. SIMERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Rams, who have remained aggressive in the free-agent market, bolstered the 
wide receiver position Monday with the acquisition of Jessie Hester. 
</P>
<P>
 Hester, a former Raider who caught 64 passes for 835 yards with Indianapolis 
last season, agreed to a one-year contract with the Rams. The Rams also 
maintained an option on Hester's services in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Hester, 5 feet 11, 175 pounds, was a first-round pick of the Raiders in 1985 
before being dealt to Atlanta in 1988. The Falcons released Hester in 1989, and 
after signing with Indianapolis in 1990, he averaged 57 catches a season with 
the Colts. 
</P>
<P>
 Hester impressed the Rams in a workout this off-season, but his signing didn't 
become a priority until after the team failed to get Houston's Haywood 
Jeffires. 
</P>
<P>
 "He brings speed to us and he becomes an excellent downfield target for 
quarterback Chris Miller," said Joe Vitt, Ram assistant head coach, who has 
been in charge of the team's free-agent efforts. "We have completely turned the 
wide receiver position around; that was one of the key things we set out to do 
in the off-season." 
</P>
<P>
 Henry Ellard led the Rams in receiving a year ago with 61 catches for 945 
yards, but Ellard signed with Washington after the Rams made it obvious they 
had no intention of re-signing him. 
</P>
<P>
 The team traded for Charger wide receiver Nate Lewis, signed New England's 
Greg McMurtry and used a second-round draft choice on Memphis State's Isaac 
Bruce. Flipper Anderson, who remains on the roster, reported for off-season 
workouts recently at Rams Park for the first time that team officials could 
recall. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams also reached agreement on a two-year contract with linebacker Chris 
Martin, who played in every game last season and started four. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was a priority signing for us," Vitt said. "It might not seem like a big 
deal to some people, but for anyone who studies film it's obvious how much he 
means to this team." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams announced the signing of reserve cornerback Dexter Davis Monday, and 
Vitt said the team will continue to pursue players as they become available 
around the league due to salary cap concerns elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had a great off-season, and I feel pretty good about what we've done," 
Vitt said. "We made a run at some people who got away, but it wasn't for a lack 
of effort or commitment from the front office. Going into camp I think it looks 
like we have a very good chance to be successful this season."

A READY-MADE SOLUTION; LAGUNA TURNS TO PREFAB HOUSES FOR AFFORDABLE 
REPLACEMENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE EARNEST, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sarah Thurston Park is a community like no other. For most of its residents, 
flower-fringed footpaths provide the only access. Almost no one has a garage. 
</P>
<P>
 The Laguna Canyon neighborhood, originally subdivided as campsites in the 
1920s, boasts some of the city's oldest homes. Spared by last October's 
firestorm, it is a mix of old world charm, friendly funkiness and palpable 
deterioration. 
</P>
<P>
 And by late summer it will become home to an incongruous new structure: a 
manufactured house. 
</P>
<P>
 In a surprising move for a city bent on preserving its village ambience, 
Laguna Beach has become first to sign up for a county-run program that helps 
low- and moderate-income residents get low-interest loans to buy prefabricated 
houses. 
</P>
<P>
 And Donna and Gordon Connolly, who live in a sagging 
sandwich-shop-turned-cottage with crooked walls and a purple wooden floor, are 
in line for the first one: a three-bedroom version with a $47,000 price tag. 
</P>
<P>
 Donna Connolly, an artist and yoga instructor, who is nicknamed Regumbah, said 
her goal is to "funk it up" so the prefabricated structure will blend into the 
community. 
</P>
<P>
 Her neighbors are watching. And some of them are also pondering the benefits 
of ready-to-wear houses. 
</P>
<P>
 "Actually, we've got quite a lot of interest in the area," said Connolly, who 
has lived at Sarah Thurston Park since 1968. "It's going to have a real impact 
on the neighborhood." 
</P>
<P>
 County and city officials say the Manufactured Housing Program now being 
launched by the county will provide a welcome option for qualifying residents, 
including some who lost homes in the fall blaze that destroyed or damaged more 
than 400 homes. 
</P>
<P>
 In particular, they say, the program could benefit the fire-racked Canyon 
Acres community next door to Sarah Thurston Park. 
</P>
<P>
 "The (fire victims) who have not started rebuilding . . . once they see these 
homes, there could be a sizable number of people who are interested," said Ken 
Baer, community development representative for the county's Housing and 
Redevelopment Department. 
</P>
<P>
 The county program is designed primarily for owners of empty lots or families 
with houses too dilapidated to refurbish -- the Connollys, for example, whose 
half-century-old home is draped with tarp and sags slightly in the center 
because it has no foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 As fond as she is of her rickety abode, Donna Connolly said she longs for the 
day she will be able to bake a level cake. And it will be nice not to fret 
about mushrooms sprouting inside her house after a heavy rain. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm probably the only person you know who has to edge a bedroom," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Manufactured Housing Program is a joint venture with the Orange County 
Affordable Housing Clearing House, a consortium of 32 banks that provide 
low-cost loans for affordable housing. 
</P>
<P>
 The loan pays for the house and landscaping and the county uses state or 
federal funds to demolish the old home, temporarily relocate residents and 
ready the lot for redevelopment, including installation of fencing or 
preparation of the parcel for utilities, if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The program is fueled largely by money generated by bond sales from the 1988 
Neighborhood Development and Preservation Program, Baer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cities with more than 50,000 residents can apply to the state or federal 
government to operate their own program, and some already have, including 
Orange, Anaheim, Lake Forest and Santa Ana, Baer said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Laguna Beach, manufactured houses, like all new homes, must clear that 
sometimes-formidable hurdle known as the Design Review Board to ensure they are 
compatible with the neighborhood. But city planner David Ebeling said plans for 
prefab houses are malleable. 
</P>
<P>
 "These things can be made to look however you want them to look," he said. 
"Materials can change, window treatments can change." 
</P>
<P>
 The homes are built to withstand up to a 7.0-magnitude earthquake and range 
from 1,000 to 4,000 square feet, Baer said, with most averaging 1,300 square 
feet. The majority have three bedrooms and two baths. The average cost is 
$55,000, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Prefabricated houses are generally built in modules -- complete with 
appliances in place -- on an assembly line, then assembled at the site. Most 
can be erected in a day. 
</P>
<P>
 It is still unclear, however, how many Laguna Beach residents will warm to the 
idea of ready-made homes. Most Canyon Acres residents, for example, say they 
want their scarred neighborhood re-created in its former image. 
</P>
<P>
 But former Sarah Thurston Park resident John Thorne, who now lives in South 
Pasadena, said he has already made up his mind. 
</P>
<P>
 Thorne was forced from Sarah Thurston Park seven years ago when his old house 
was condemned and demolished. He has long-hoped to retire in his old 
neighborhood and is eager to plunk a prefab house on his now vacant lot. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those manufactured houses, once they put them together, you couldn't tell if 
their manufactured houses or not," Thorne said. "It seems as comfortable as any 
other house." 
</P>
<P>
 Donna Connolly, whose own prefab home should be ready by September, said she 
is eager to have Thorne and his wife back as neighbors. Still, she is 
ambivalent about blazing the trail for manufactured homes. 
</P>
<P>
 "They can't look like real weird, cheap houses," she said. "They've got to 
have charm to them or it's going to have a real negative impact on the 
neighborhood. The neighbors won't like that. I won't like that. 
</P>
<P>
 "But then I look at the house I'm living in," she added. "Anything's got to be 
better than that." One-Day Solution Prefabricated houses differ from the 
site-built varietyi in that they are produced on an assembly line. They can be 
erected in single day. Average life expectancy is about 50 years. * The Process 
The houses come as a finished product, appliances in place. But some assembly 
is required: Sections joined at roof beams using clamps and bolts. Inside house 
seams covered with panels or filled. Carpeting laid after fall sections are 
connected. Roof seams covered with ridge cap, shingled. Plumbing connected with 
prefabricated fixtures. Home plugged into on-site electrical power. Source:

SAN CLEMENTE VOTES TO LET COUNTY TAKE OVER FIREFIGHTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEN HALL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Over the objections of firefighters, the San Clemente City Council voted 
unanimously Monday to disband its 66-year-old Fire Department and contract fire 
services with the county. 
</P>
<P>
 City Councilman Truman Benedict called the decision "extremely tough. I've 
lived here in this town for 45 years. Most of these firemen have grown up here 
and gone to San Clemente High School. But we have to think of the whole city." 
</P>
<P>
 With the shift, expected to take 60 to 90 days, San Clemente becomes the sixth 
city in Orange County to disband its own fire department and contract with the 
county. 
</P>
<P>
 Most council members said their vote was based on economics. An Orange County 
Fire Department report concludes the change not only will maintain the same 
level of service but also will save the city an estimated $200,000 the first 
year and a total of $2.7 million over the next five years. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the uproar last year when San Clemente disbanded its Police Department 
and contracted with the Sheriff's Department, there has been little public 
opposition to the move except from the city firefighters' association. 
</P>
<P>
 Although each member of the 40-firefighter force will be guaranteed a county 
job, only half will stay in San Clemente. The others will be assigned elsewhere 
in South County. The Orange County Fire Department will make up the staffing 
difference in the city with other firefighters. 
</P>
<P>
 The firefighters' association decided not to protest the move Monday night, 
President Jim Dahl said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We could have jumped up and screamed about this, but there is nothing really 
we can do about it. Of course, we would like to be our own department, but 
there is no question the county can do it cheaper."  
</P>
<P>
 The move comes amid a major downsizing of the San Clemente city staff at 
several levels. Starting with the switch to the Sheriff's Department last 
spring, the city has more recently privatized its meter-reading services, 
beaches and park maintenance services, its fleet maintenance and 
street-striping crews. 
</P>
<P>
 The switch to the Sheriff's Department reportedly saved $2.3 million this 
year, and the other moves -- not including the Fire Department -- are expected 
to save an additional $2.45 million over the next five years. They also will 
reduce the number of city personnel by 36% from its 1991-92 level of 353 
employees, according to city reports. 
</P>
<P>
 City Manager Michael W. Parness called the cuts necessary but difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any time you suggest something like this, you are going to have turmoil," 
Parness said. "We have people who have been serving the city well for many 
years. This is a big shock to them, and of course they are not excited about it 
. . . but the alternatives, raising taxes or cutting services, are not real 
positive and not acceptable to the council." 
</P>
<P>
 In the past 15 years, the cities of Stanton, Seal Beach, Tustin and Placentia 
also have joined the county Fire Department. Earlier this year the city of 
Buena Park also opted to join the county program, a move slated to take effect 
Oct. 1.

SAN JOAQUIN HILLS TOLLWAY PROTESTERS REACH NO-JAIL PLEA AGREEMENT;

FIGHTING THE ROAD PROJECT.

 Eight Earth First! activists arrested last year for chaining themselves to 
bulldozers about to begin construction of the San Joaquin Hills tollway have 
promised not to do it again in exchange for a penalty limited to 10 days of 
community service and informal probation. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the plea agreement reached Monday, one day before the case was to 
go to trial, the activists pleaded no contest to charges of trespassing and 
failing to disperse. They also promised not to set foot on transportation 
corridor construction sites in Laguna Hills and Laguna Niguel until 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not that we won't demonstrate or harass," said Patrick T. Mitchell, 27, 
one of the defendants. "It's just going to take our demonstrations in a new 
direction; it will force us to be a little more creative." 
</P>
<P>
 A hearing is set for July 8 at Municipal Court in Laguna Niguel to determine 
whether and how much the activists should pay in restitution for lost income 
and expenses associated with their actions. 
</P>
<P>
 The arrests stemmed from an incident on Sept. 27 in which the activists, 
opposing the new road for environmental reasons, chained themselves to 
bulldozers at the tollway construction site. They were cut free several hours 
later by firefighters. The protest tied up eight pieces of earthmoving 
equipment for about 3 1/2 hours.  
</P>
<P>
 Taken to the Laguna Niguel sheriff's substation, the eight protesters were 
charged with two misdemeanors, each of which carries a maximum six-month jail 
term and $1,000 fine. All were released the same night. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy district attorney Matt McCormick, the prosecutor on the case, said 
Monday that he was satisfied with the outcome. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it was a fair disposition all the way around," he said. "The 
defendants seemed very satisfied, and everybody was impressed with the work the 
commissioner put in." 
</P>
<P>
 During their two-year probation, the eight activists will be required to pay 
any restitution determined by the court and stay away from transportation 
corridor construction sites. They will not, Schwartz said, be required to 
report regularly to a probation officer. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell on Monday said that the group still believed it had done nothing 
wrong but decided to settle to avoid a prolonged trial. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our feeling was that we would be a lot more effective outside the courtroom," 
he said. "We just feel it's time to move on. There is some real work to do out 
there." 
</P>
<P>
 The eight are Michael S. Richey of Costa Mesa; Bradford W. Berger of Irvine; 
Nicole A. Gasparik of Irvine; Martin C. Stout of Oceanside; Mitchell of Garden 
Grove; Udo Wald of San Diego; Geoff S. Neilson of Tustin and Kristin A. Painter 
of Santa Ana.

TEENS EQUALLY CULPABLE, SAYS TAY PROSECUTOR; TRIAL: THE OPENING STATEMENT 
PLACES AS MUCH BLAME ON YOUTH WHO STOOD LOOKOUT AS ONE WHO LANDED FIRST BLOW IN 
THE KILLING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The teen-ager who landed the first blow with a baseball bat and another teen 
who acted as a lookout are equally culpable in the New Year's Eve 1992 murder 
of honors student Stuart A. Tay, a prosecutor told jurors Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Abraham Acosta, 17, of Buena Park and Kirn Kim, 18, of Fullerton, face life in 
prison without parole if convicted of all charges. Three other teen-agers have 
already been convicted of murdering Tay after a planned computer heist went 
awry. 
</P>
<P>
 During his opening statement, Deputy Dist. Atty. Lewis R. Rosenblum repeated 
much of the evidence presented during an earlier trial for convicted ringleader 
Robert Chan, 19, also of Fullerton. Rosenblum told jurors that Acosta and Kim 
are guilty of premeditated murder. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not some irresponsible, impulsive act, but a well-thought out and 
rehearsed plan to catch a victim by surprise," Rosenblum told jurors. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorneys will have the chance to present their opening statements 
this morning in Orange County Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Public Defender Denise Gragg is expected to tell jurors that Acosta is 
a mentally impaired youth who was easily manipulated by his fellow teens, while 
defense attorney Allan H. Stokke is expected to downplay the role of his client 
Kim, who did not participate in the bludgeoning. Under state law, however, Kim 
can be held equally responsible. 
</P>
<P>
 The case has gained widespread attention because the victim and most of the 
defendants seemed to be college-bound, ambitious students who came from loving, 
affluent families. 
</P>
<P>
 Chan, a one-time candidate for class valedictorian, faces life in prison 
without parole when he is sentenced this summer. Mun Bong Kang, 19, also of 
Fullerton, pleaded guilty to first-degree murder and faces the same sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 While the four teens have been prosecuted as adults, a fifth defendant, 
Charles Choe, now 18, and also of Fullerton, was prosecuted as a juvenile after 
he agreed to testify against his former co-defendants. He is expected to be 
released from the California Youth Authority when he turns 25. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The defendants attended Sunny Hills High School in Fullerton. Tay, 17, of 
Orange, was an honors student at Foothill High School in Santa Ana who had 
dreams of becoming a physician. 
</P>
<P>
 But Rosenblum told jurors Monday that Tay also had another side to him, one 
that was intrigued with crime and gangs. He liked to brag about involvement in 
spy networks and underworld activities, apparently to impress those around him, 
the prosecutor said. 
</P>
<P>
 "His interest in this got him into some trouble" after it led him to Chan, 
Rosenblum told jurors. "Getting involved with Robert Chan was the beginning of 
the end of Stuart's life." 
</P>
<P>
 Tay took on an alias and claimed he was much older when he sought out Chan. 
The two hatched a plan to rob an Anaheim computer-parts dealer and recruited 
the four other teens to carry out the scheme, the prosecutor said. 
</P>
<P>
 When Chan discovered Tay was lying about his age and name, Chan decided to 
kill Tay because he feared a double-cross, Rosenblum told jurors. 
</P>
<P>
 Tay was lured to Acosta's garage, where Acosta and Chan beat him with baseball 
bats before forcing rubbing alcohol down his throat and taping shut the 
victim's nose and mouth, Rosenblum said. Tay was then buried in a shallow grave 
that Acosta, Kim and Chan had dug the day before, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kim then drove Tay's car to Compton, leaving the keys in the ignition in the 
hopes of misleading authorities into believing Tay was the victim of a 
carjacking, Rosenblum said. The teens used rubber gloves to hide fingerprints, 
cleaned up blood splatters in the garage and even used spray-on hair color to 
help disguise Kim's appearance, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Acosta was paid $100 for his role and went to Knott's Berry Farm after burying 
Tay in his back yard, the prosecutor said. 
</P>
<P>
 Prior to opening statements, Orange County Superior Court Judge Kathleen E. 
O'Leary ruled that Acosta's diminished mental capacity left him unable to 
understand his rights following his arrest, and ruled that incriminating 
statements he made to police would not be admissible during the trial.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COSTA MESA; LIONS CLUB PARADE, FISH FRY SUCCESSFUL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLSON CUMMER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With more than 7,500 fish dinners sold and more that 65,000 guests, last 
weekend's 49th annual Lions Club parade and fish fry has been declared a 
success. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Scheafer, president of the Costa Mesa-Newport Harbor Lions Club, said the 
group is still counting, but he expects to have between $130,000 and $150,000 
to distribute to charities. 
</P>
<P>
 Each year the club gives money to between 40 and 50 organizations, Scheafer 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the money is given to the UC Irvine Organ and Tissue Bank, which 
Scheafer said the Lions founded and continues to support. 
</P>
<P>
 Other groups including the Boys and Girls Club and the Costa Mesa Little 
League will apply for a grant from the Lions, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Scheafer said this year's fish fry raised far more money than the 1993 event, 
when the parade had to be canceled because of rain. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't actually set any records, but we did far better than we did last 
year." The record is $168,000, Scheafer said. "The economy was better, 
probably," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 300 groups marched Saturday in the parade, many paying homage to the 
50th anniversary of D-day. Bands, drill teams, veterans' organizations and 
local business groups marched down Harbor Boulevard. Entertainment and other 
events were held at the Lions Park, at Park Avenue near 18th Street. WILLSON

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ORANGE; DISTRICT SEEKS HELP OF HIRING CONSULTANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLEY WRIGHT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Orange Unified School District Board of Education will act this week on 
two fronts to fill some of the vacancies within the administration. 
</P>
<P>
 Board members will vote Thursday on hiring a consultant to help in their 
superintendent search and will accept resumes this week for acting 
superintendent, according to board President Maureen Aschoff. 
</P>
<P>
 The superintendent job has been open for more than two years, and the board 
lost its interim superintendent when Marilyn J. Corey resigned in April. 
</P>
<P>
 The 26,000-student district serves Orange, Villa Park and sections of Anaheim 
Hills, Garden Grove and Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 Gretchen Hanson, acting superintendent and assistant superintendent for 
educational services, told board members in May that she will leave at the end 
of June to marry and move to the Redding area. 
</P>
<P>
 David Reger, president of the Orange Unified Education Assn., said he is sorry 
to see Hanson go. "She leaves a big hole," he said. "Will we get an assistant 
acting interim superintendent? How far will we carry this thing?" 
</P>
<P>
 The teachers union is concerned about the lack of continuity on the board, 
Reger added. 
</P>
<P>
 Board members hope to alleviate some of those worries Thursday night when 
education consultant Rudy Gatti presents his superintendent search proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 Gatti, who is based in the San Francisco Bay Area, first offered his proposal 
to launch a nationwide search to board members in a closed session Thursday. 
His fee for the search will not exceed $11,000, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gatti will continue advising the superintendent for a year after he or she is 
hired, Aschoff said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gatti was referred to the board by Lee Newcomer, the last education consultant 
to search for a superintendent. 
</P>
<P>
 The board, which also needs to find an assistant superintendent, hopes to use 
staff vacancies that have beset the district as a lure to prospective 
candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 "The new superintendent who comes in will have the opportunity to fill key 
positions in the Cabinet," Aschoff said. "That's an incentive for someone to 
come into Orange." 
</P>
<P>
 The board will interview candidates for acting superintendent next week, 
Aschoff said. 
</P>
<P>
 Eight candidates have applied so far, and Aschoff said she is pleased with the 
quality of the applicants, most of whom come from within the county. LESLEY

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; SHOWCASE OF TALENT AND HARD WORK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Deaf since birth, 10-year-old Randy Dayus has found a way to express himself. 
He has learned to paint, and has gotten good enough to have some of his works 
displayed at a local museum. 
</P>
<P>
 In "Dreamscape" -- a painting done in bright yellow, red, range and green -- 
Dayus, a fifth-grader, drew himself playing with elephants and tigers in a zoo, 
riding his bike and shooting basketballs. 
</P>
<P>
 "He just loves to draw," said the boy's father, Mark Dayus. "He draws the 
things that he likes to do the most." 
</P>
<P>
 Dayus is among 60 students in the Santa Ana Unified School District who have 
participated in a 20-week art course taught by Joycelyn Dixon and Helen Seigel 
and whose work is being shown at the Newport Harbor Art Museum. 
</P>
<P>
 The program is intended to encourage students to develop their artistic 
talents. Students include those in special education, gifted and talented, and 
deaf and hard-of-hearing programs. Dayus is one of six students at a deaf and 
hard-of-hearing program at Taft Elementary School in Santa Ana whose artworks 
are exhibited. 
</P>
<P>
 Dubbed "Major Art/Minor Artists," the exhibit features work by third-, 
fourth-, and fifth-graders from Taft, James A. Garfield, Jefferson and 
Remington elementary schools. The students' artworks will be displayed until 
June 29 at the Newport Beach museum, which has become has become a partner of 
the art project with the Santa Ana school district over the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was difficult," said Seigel, who has conducted weekly art classes at the 
four schools. "Kids are not used to being pushed this hard. We really 
challenged them." But Seigel said she was impressed by the quality of the work, 
as she happily watched about 100 people looking at the display at Friday's 
opening of the art exhibit. 
</P>
<P>
 Seigel said students were urged to express themselves. In one project, the 
students traced each other on paper, then painted clothes on the figures to 
make them look like kings and queens. 
</P>
<P>
 A mask made from plaster and molded from a child's face was added to make the 
work three-dimensional. Each figure also wore a gold glitter-covered crown. The 
figures were then painted in purple, turquoise and blue and were among the 
crowd's favorites Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The exhibit includes oversized cups and saucers like those from "Alice in 
Wonderland" and tree branches covered with cloth, colored wire rings and other 
ornaments to make them look like scepters. 
</P>
<P>
 "This will encourage children with art talents to see themselves as real 
artists," said Debbie McCormick, principal of Jefferson Elementary School, 
which had 25 student participants. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the Jefferson students was Erika Gonzalez, who drew herself playing a 
saxophone in a room full of flowers and bright-colored curtains. 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzalez, 10, a fourth-grader, said it was fun to see people looking at her 
painting and admiring it. 
</P>
<P>
 "It makes me feel proud and important," Gonzalez said.BERT ELJERA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: WESTMINSTER; FREE TB SCREENING OFFERED TO CHILDREN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE BERKMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Free tuberculosis screenings will be offered next week by the Garden Grove 
Unified School District to ease the minds of the parents whose children attend 
schools that send graduates to La Quinta High School, which has suffered a 
major TB outbreak. 
</P>
<P>
 Alan Trudell, spokesman for the school district, said that this week 4,800 
flyers with information about the screening are being sent home with students 
at Sarah McGarvin Intermediate School in Westminster, James Irvine Intermediate 
School in Garden Grove, Ethan B. Allen Elementary School in Fountain Valley and 
Susan B. Anthony, Leo Carrillo, John Marshall, and Post elementary schools in 
Westminster and Thomas Paine Elementary School in Garden Grove. 
</P>
<P>
 Trudell said skin tests, which will be given Monday between 2:30 and 7 p.m. at 
James Irvine Intermediate School, are voluntary and not part of the mandatory 
testing being conducted by the Orange County Health Care Agency in response to 
the La Quinta situation. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Hugh Stallworth, the county public health officer, said there is no reason 
to believe that there are any undiagnosed cases of tuberculosis among younger 
siblings of La Quinta students. 
</P>
<P>
 Trudell said while the screening is intended for schoolchildren and faculty, 
anyone from any part of Orange County may take advantage it. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday's skin tests will be followed by skin readings Wednesday, again from 
2:30 to 7 p.m. at James Irvine Intermediate School. All those who had the 
screenings should return for a skin reading, which reveals exposure to TB. 
Those who test positive, he said, will be referred to private physicians or the 
county for chest X-rays and sputum tests to detect active disease. LESLIE

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAGUNA BEACH; CITY TO CONSIDER NEW SOCCER FIELD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE EARNEST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council tonight will consider whether to formally begin talks with 
the state about the possibility of installing a soccer field on a slice of 
Crystal Cove State Park behind El Morro Elementary School. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Wayne Peterson, who placed the subject on the agenda, said the 
sports' popularity has outgrown the space needed to play the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Laguna Beach now has more than 900 youngsters playing soccer, but its one 
field at Moulton Meadows Park is not regulation size, Peterson said. 
</P>
<P>
 jLast year, when a Laguna Beach American Youth Soccer Organization team made 
the playoffs, members were forced to play their "home" game in Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
 "And that just doesn't make any sense," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Peterson said AYSO representatives approached him about the need for an 
another field, especially for older children. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're getting more junior high and high school kids in the sport now as the 
sport matures," he said. "It's just proved to be very, very successful." 
</P>
<P>
 Peterson cautioned, however, that state officials were only lukewarm to the 
early suggestions of scheduling talks. 
</P>
<P>
 "The state has not given us a lot of encouragement, but they have said they 
are willing to discuss it with us," Peterson said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the city's staff has done only "very minor analysis" of the 
project so far, according to a memo from Peterson to his colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
 The new field would be east of a dirt road that runs parallel to Coast 
Highway, directly behind the school. The earth would have to be leveled, the 
memo says. 
</P>
<P>
 The council will decide tonight whether to direct city staff to formally begin 
talks with AYSO representatives, the Laguna Beach Unified School District and 
state park officials about the installation of the field. The council meeting 
begins at 6 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Robert F. Gentry indicated Monday that he is open to suggestions. 
</P>
<P>
 "It just sounded to me like it was a very good arrangement, not only for the 
families in Laguna Beach but for other families as well," Gentry said. "But 
certainly it needs to be evaluated." LESLIE EARNESTSOCCER

<P>
 Two elementary schools in the Ocean View School District are among 266 
statewide to receive Healthy Start grants, the California Department of 
Education announced. 
</P>
<P>
 The goal of Healthy Start is to improve children's academic readiness and 
success, family functioning, health, self-esteem and job status by providing a 
host of integrated services at or near schools. 
</P>
<P>
 The services include health, mental health, social and educational programs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Healthy Start is one of the most promising and exciting initiatives for kids 
in California today," said William D. Dawson, acting superintendent of public 
instruction. 
</P>
<P>
 The program will operate at 890 schools in communities throughout the state.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAGUNA NIGUEL; TARGET UNIT AIMS TO BATTLE AREA GANGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FERNANDO ROMERO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Following the example of the Westminster Police Department's successful gang 
unit, three county law enforcement agencies are joining efforts to go after 
hard-core gang members in South County, police officials announced Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County Sheriff's Department has joined the district attorney's 
office and the probation department to create the Tri-Agency Resource Gang 
Enforcement Team (TARGET) to "take the people off the street who belong in 
jail," said Steve Carroll, head of the sheriff's gang enforcement team. 
</P>
<P>
 Specifically, he said, TARGET will be aimed at gang leaders and members on 
gang-term probation, which does not allow them to associate with other gang 
members. In essence, he said, the new unit will focus on 63 gang members who 
are "supposed to be the worst." 
</P>
<P>
 The TARGET unit will consist of one deputy district attorney, one district 
attorney's investigator, one probation officer and two sheriff's deputies. 
</P>
<P>
 The unit will be based in Laguna Niguel and cover all cities and 
unincorporated areas from Irvine to the San Diego County line, Carroll said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the idea to create TARGET in South County originated with the district 
attorney's office, which liked the relative success of a similar unit operating 
in Westminster. The Westminster program, now in its third year, has been aimed 
mainly at gang leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 Last July, the Westminster's unit had jailed 43 of 80 individuals targeted. 
More recent statistics were not available Monday. Countywide, in 1993, there 
were about 17,000 known gang members -- 85% of whom are Latino -- in 275 
identified gangs, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 By targeting the leaders of these gangs, Carroll said, "we're going after the 
people who righteously belong in jail." He said there are gang members who are 
so violent in nature that they will not change. "The young ones, you can help," 
he said.FERNANDO ROMERO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: BREA; COUNCIL TO CONSIDER PROPOSED FEE HIKES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN EYERLY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Proposed fee hikes for water use and street sweeping will be considered by the 
City Council when it meets at 7 tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 Citing an independent financial analysis, city staff members are recommending 
that water rates be increased from $1.18 per hundred cubic feet to $1.38.For 
typical Brea homeowners, this would translate to a $4 monthly hike. 
</P>
<P>
 One reason for the proposed increase is that starting July 1, Brea must pay an 
additional $31 per acre foot for water purchased from the Metropolitan Water 
District of Orange County. The district currently supplies 70% of Brea's water. 
</P>
<P>
 The council is expected to consider increasing the residential street sweeping 
rate by 21 cents per month. This hike would be partly offset by a proposed 
decrease of 10 cents per month for residential trash collection. 
</P>
<P>
 Businesses in Brea are facing a possible 12% monthly hike in street sweeping 
rates and a 2.25% raise in trash-disposal costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Also on the council agenda is a draft zoning ordinance amendment intended to 
encourage preservation of local historic structures and objects. 
</P>
<P>
 If approved, the amendment would establish a historic register, similar to the 
National Register of Historic Places, that would help Brea receive state or 
federal funding for preservation projects. 
</P>
<P>
 The ordinance also calls for a review process that would be invoked when 
alterations are proposed to historic structures. Minor alterations would be 
considered by city staff members, while major alterations, including 
demolition, would be reviewed by the Planning Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 Property owners would be given a series of incentives to preserve historic 
structures under the ordinance. These could include property tax deductions, 
technical assistance from preservation professionals, and grants or loans for 
rehabilitating structures. ALAN EYERLY

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ANAHEIM; CITY TO WEIGH MAKING GOLF COURSES PRIVATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN MILLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council is scheduled tonight to consider a proposal to privatize its 
two municipal golf courses -- a move that a July study said would generate 
between $300,000 and $500,000 in extra city revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials have recommended the council reject the privatization proposal 
since the financial return would be smaller than predicted in the July study.A 
city staff report said, at best, privatizing the golf courses would deliver 
$2.1 million to the city over the next 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Further, said city officials, Anaheim might endanger its current annual profit 
of about $1.2 million from its golf courses if it decided to privatize. Under 
certain proposals outlined in the analysis, the city would not be guaranteed a 
minimum return and could actually lose money if the new operators let the 
courses decline. 
</P>
<P>
 The city received six bids to operate the golf courses. But an independent 
evaluator from the United States Golf Assn., or USGA, found Anaheim's golf 
courses superior to golf courses maintained by the private companies that had 
offered bids. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anaheim courses, unlike other municipal courses, have completed maintenance 
on time and without excuses. Furthermore, their equipment inventories are 
state-of-the-art and when greens or tees justify reconstruction, the projects 
are completed using the highest industry standards," said the USGA evaluator. 
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim Hills Golf Course, 6501 E. Nohl Ranch Road, and H.G. "Dad" Miller 
Public Golf Course, 430 N. Gilbert St., attract more than 20,000 golfers per 
month, according to city officials. 
</P>
<P>
 The weekday rate to play both courses is $16, while the weekend rate is $22. 
</P>
<P>
 The city began examining a proposal to privatize golf courses in January, 
1993, in hopes of raising more money for its general fund.MARTIN MILLER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: PLACENTIA; SPEED LIMIT ASKED FOR ORCHARD DRIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIELLE A. FOUQUETTE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council tonight will consider a request from the Police Department 
that a speed limit be set for Orchard Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 Because there is no posted limit now, drivers can go up to 55 m.p.h. without 
being ticketed. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials say a speed limit was never established because until recently 
the street existed in one- and two-block segments. 
</P>
<P>
 But last year the city finished linking those segments, and the Placentia 
portion of the street now stretches from Lakeview Avenue on the east to just 
past Van Buren Street on the west. 
</P>
<P>
 Orchard continues for a few blocks east of the city limits to Kellogg Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's traffic engineer has recommended that the speed limit be 30 m.p.h. 
A recent study shows most cars travel from 23 to 34 m.p.h. on the street. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no record of how many motorists exceed that speed because without a 
posted limit, police can only ticket those who drive faster than 55 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
 Public Works Director Christopher Becker said that he has received no 
complaints from residents about speeding but that Orchard is the only street in 
the city without a posted speed limit. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year the city developed the segment between Richfield Road and Highland 
Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Though traffic on Orchard, estimated at 1,500 to 2,000 cars a day, has not 
increased since then, Becker said, residential development planned in the area 
could change that. DANIELLE A. FOUQUETTE

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SEAL BEACH; PLAN FOR VOLLEYBALL COURT ADVANCES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A plan to build a volleyball court and install new playground equipment at 
Edison Park has received approval from the city's Parks Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 But opponents will have a final chance to halt the project when the City 
Council takes up the matter in the next few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 College Park West residents have spent more than a year planning the park's 
first improvement project in more than 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal has raised the ire of residents whose homes back onto the park. 
</P>
<P>
 They fear the volleyball court will increase noise and bring rowdy youths into 
the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 The Parks Commission unanimously approved the plan last month, agreeing with 
proponents of the project who argued that Edison Park and the surrounding 
neighborhood would benefit from the volleyball court. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are delighted with the decision," said Lisa Chattler, a leader of the 
Edison Improvement Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 If the council approves the plan, Chattler said, residents will attempt to 
raise the $12,000 needed for new playground equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 The group has already raised about $6,000. SHELBY GRAD

3 FULLERTON COUNCIL RECALL TARGETS DROPPED FROM SUIT; TAX: THEY ARE NO LONGER 
DEFENDANTS IN LAWSUIT CHALLENGING A NEW TAX BUT FACE A DECISION BY VOTERS. 
</P>

<P>
 Three City Council members, who are targeted for recall today because they 
voted for a 2% utility tax, have been dropped as defendants in a lawsuit 
challenging that action, city officials announced. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit, brought by former Chamber of Commerce President Thomas O'Neill, had 
named the city, Mayor A.B. (Buck) Catlin and council members Molly McClanahan 
and Don Bankhead, who voted for the tax in July.It argued that voters should 
have been allowed to decide on the tax. 
</P>
<P>
 Catlin and city attorney R.K. Fox said Monday that both sides agreed not to 
talk about the reasons for the council members being dropped from the suit 
until after the election. But Catlin said, "Essentially, the three of us are 
home free on this."  
</P>
<P>
 O'Neill could not be reached for comment.  
</P>
<P>
 The case still is being pursued in Orange County Superior Court against the 
city on the grounds that it failed to properly advertise the pending utility 
tax hike, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The recall effort began after the City Council voted 3 to 2 in favor of the 2% 
tax on water, telephone, electricity, natural gas and cable television bills.  
</P>
<P>
 City Clerk Anne M. York later became a recall target because she allegedly 
delayed the recall process when she rejected petitions against the three 
council members for exceeding the legal word limit, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Catlin, McClanahan and Bankhead maintain that they voted for the tax to save 
police and fire services, which would have been cut due to budget shortfalls.

COSTA MESA STALLS AUTO CLUB PROJECT

<TEXT>
<P>
 A bid by the Automobile Club of Southern California to become the city's 
largest employer hit a roadblock Monday when council members could not agree on 
what impact the large project would have on traffic and housing in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Auto Club proposed to double the size of its offices at 3333 Fairview Road, 
adding 500,000 square feet of space. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are issues that have come up repeatedly and have not been resolved, at 
least to my satisfaction," Mayor Sandra L. Genis said. 
</P>
<P>
 Peter R. McDonald, vice president of Auto Club, said, "The thing that puzzles 
me is that the traffic study has been done for about three months. It's 
frustrating." 
</P>
<P>
 The council will reconsider the project at its June 20 meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 The expansion would add 1,400 employees to the current 1,135, Auto Club has 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 But some residents and people who worked to develop the 1990 city General Plan 
protested the large development last week at the Planning Commission meeting, 
saying they feared clogged streets and a burden on city services. They also 
feared it would set a precedent for other large developments.

RAPE SUSPECT FACES 37 FELONY CHARGES IN 4 ABDUCTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Authorities brought 37 felony charges Monday against a Woodland Hills man 
arrested last week on suspicion of abducting and raping or sexually molesting 
four women and girls, the youngest only 10. 
</P>
<P>
 Howard August Davis, the 29-year-old son of a Beverly Hills police officer, 
was scheduled to be arraigned today in Van Nuys Municipal Court. He was being 
held in lieu of $1.1 million bail at the Los Angeles police station in Van 
Nuys, but prosecutors planned to ask a judge to raise the figure to $2 million. 
</P>
<P>
 In a criminal complaint filed Monday by the district attorney's office, Davis 
was charged with kidnaping for sexual purposes, rape, forcible oral copulation, 
sodomy, digital penetration and child molestation. 
</P>
<P>
 The first three victims -- two 18, another 17 -- were abducted at knifepoint 
and raped in isolated locations, either in the Santa Monica Mountains or in 
darkened alleys, investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
 The fourth person attacked, a 10-year-old girl who was walking to her home 
with groceries for her family, was threatened with a stun gun, according to 
Detective F. Jay Romaine of the Los Angeles Police Department. She was sexually 
molested but not raped. 
</P>
<P>
 All of the victims were dropped off after the attacks at locations miles from 
where they were abducted. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis beat his victims -- "in some cases, depending on resistance" -- but he 
did not stab any of the three teens, nor did he use the stun gun on the 
10-year-old, according to Romaine. 
</P>
<P>
 Police arrested Davis without incident near the intersection of Ventura 
Boulevard and Sale Avenue on Friday night, two days after investigators 
realized a serial rapist was attacking young females in the west San Fernando 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is amazingly good police work for them to arrest a suspect in this case so 
quickly based on the information they had," said Deputy Dist. Atty. Martin L. 
Herscovitz, who filed the charges. Romaine credited the arrest to "basic, good 
police work, and some luck." 
</P>
<P>
 Refusing to provide specifics, Romaine said Davis was apprehended by West 
Valley police officers who had a composite drawing of the rapist and were 
looking for a small, light-colored pickup truck used to abduct all four 
victims. 
</P>
<P>
 "He looked a lot like the composite," Romaine said, adding that at least one 
of the victims has since identified Davis in a photo lineup. Police said Davis 
was wearing "distinctive" clothing when he was arrested, and they recovered the 
four-inch knife believed used in the first three attacks. 
</P>
<P>
 Though Davis was arrested on Ventura Boulevard, Romaine said none of the 
crimes occurred on that busy thoroughfare. Contradicting statements that 
officials made over the weekend, Romaine said Davis is not the subject of a 
flyer circulated along Ventura Boulevard which seeks help solving several 
rapes. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said Davis is a suspect, however, in several other rapes during late 
April and May. "There's some differences, and there's some similarities, too," 
Romaine said. 
</P>
<P>
 Citing the continuing investigation, Romaine refused to provide certain 
details about the attacks. Other than saying the crimes did not occur along 
Ventura Boulevard, the investigator provided no location other than the West 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 The first woman was kidnaped after she pulled into a "well-lighted spot" -- a 
business that was not open at 2:30 a.m. on May 1, Romaine said. The 18-year-old 
had been followed from her job, and when she stopped her car, Davis allegedly 
smashed her window and dragged her out of the vehicle. She was raped after 
being driven to two secluded locations in the Santa Monica Mountains in an 
incident that lasted several hours, Romaine said. 
</P>
<P>
 The second and third attacks, on May 3 and May 23, involved pedestrians who 
were kidnaped by a motorist who asked them for directions, authorities said. 
Both victims were taken to darkened allies and attacked. The third victim was 
grabbed off the sidewalk by the assailant, prompting her to scream. "There are 
people who hear her, but they're too late to do anything about it," Romaine 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 10-year-old was also asked for directions before the man "exits the 
vehicle and drags her into it," Romaine said. She was taken into the mountains 
and molested before being dropped off in a residential location, where the 
"petrified" girl sought help at a home, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know, with these kinds of cases, it's not always what's visible, it's the 
psychological" damage that can do the most harm in a sexual assault case, 
Romaine said. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, a relative who wished to remain anonymous said Davis had a troubled 
childhood. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am not defending him, the circumstances of his life are just sad," the 
family member said. 
</P>
<P>
 The relative, who had seen Davis only two or three times during the past three 
years, said the family found out about the charges from a newspaper report. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis had lived off-and-on with his parents -- Howard Davis Sr., a Beverly 
Hills police officer, and Shirley Davis, who was recently hospitalized with 
emphysema, the relative said.

JUDGE SAYS LAW REQUIRES SCHOOLS TO GIVE CLAS; EDUCATION: TWO ANTELOPE VALLEY 
BOARD MEMBERS SAY THE DISTRICT MAY APPEAL THE RULING. A STATE BILL WOULD REFORM 
THE PROCESS OF CREATING THE EXAM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A Superior Court judge ruled Monday that state law requires school districts 
to administer the controversial CLAS test, which has been praised as a 
revolutionary measure of critical thinking skills and blasted as intrusive and 
secretive. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Diane Wayne's decision came after the state sought a court order against 
the Antelope Valley Union High School District, which had refused to give the 
California Learning Assessment System test to its students. 
</P>
<P>
 "By refusing to administer the test (the district has) clearly violated its 
obligations under the Education Code," Wayne wrote in her four-page decision to 
grant the order. 
</P>
<P>
 While agreeing that the law requires a statewide assessment test be given 
annually, critics of the exam had said the Education Code does not require it 
to be the CLAS test, which is being given this year to more than 1 million 
fourth-, fifth-, eighth- and 10th-grade students. 
</P>
<P>
 Six of the 1,006 school districts in the state have opted not to give the 1994 
CLAS test. Antelope Valley is the only school district the state has taken to 
court over the matter. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite Wayne's decision and issuance of a tentative ruling, Billy Pricer, 
president of the Antelope Valley school board, said he was uncertain how the 
district would respond. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything is resting on how the judge actually words the order and what 
we're ordered to do," Pricer said. "Right now it's a waiting game until we get 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 He said the board would probably consider appealing the ruling, noting that an 
appeal would also serve as a stall tactic so the district could try to avoid 
giving the test before the school year ends June 15. 
</P>
<P>
 "Personally, I'd like to see us appeal," said board member Sue Stokka, who 
voted with Pricer and member Tony Welch in the board's April 20 decision not to 
administer CLAS. Monday's ruling "doesn't change my opinion one iota about my 
concerns about the test," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 If the district does give the test, Pricer said it would do so under protest.  
</P>
<P>
 "We went in there and (Wayne) had already made up her mind on it," said 
Pricer. "I was, naturally, rather disappointed because I thought we had a good 
case and I still think we do." 
</P>
<P>
 The school district argued unsuccessfully that the state Department of 
Education failed to adopt required rules and regulations for the administration 
of CLAS. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are no regulations in the state of California requiring testing at the 
10th grade level," said Frank J. Fekete, the school district's attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 Wayne disagreed, saying such regulations are in place and are sufficient. 
</P>
<P>
 State Department of Education officials said they were pleased with Monday's 
ruling. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have now a chance to go forward," said William D. Dawson, acting state 
superintendent of public instruction, who attended the hearing. "My interest is 
primarily in getting on with the job of improving the CLAS test for the 
future." 
</P>
<P>
 The state Senate last week approved legislation that would reauthorize the 
test for five more years and would also impose several reforms designed to 
improve public confidence in CLAS. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill by Sen. Gary K. Hart (D-Santa Barbara) would prohibit asking students 
about their sexual, moral and religious beliefs or those of their families. It 
would also create a Legislature-appointed citizens committee to review the 
final test and add parents and other members of the public to the teams of 
teachers who develop it. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics have said the literature portion of the CLAS test includes passages 
that are racist, denigrate the family and ask students to defy authority by 
writing about a school rule they disagree with. They also contend the test 
fails to measure basic skills. 
</P>
<P>
 Dawson said Monday he was hopeful that in light of Monday's ruling the five 
other school districts, which includes Acton-Agua Dulce Unified, will reverse 
their position and administer the test. Asked what action the Department of 
Education would take if those districts continued to refuse to give the test, 
Dawson said he would not comment on "hypothetical" situations. 
</P>
<P>
 Joyce Field, a member of the Acton school board, said the board may reconsider 
its position. "We'll certainly have to take a look at that. We're not going to 
ignore what happened." 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, however, Field said the majority of parents in the district 
do not want the test to be given to their children and the board has to answer 
to its constituents. 
</P>
<P>
 In her tentative ruling, Wayne also rejected the Antelope Valley district's 
argument that their decision was a matter of local control, citing a legal 
decision that said regulation and operation of public schools are a statewide 
issue as outlined in the state Constitution.

COASTING THROUGH LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUGLAS ALGER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Former test pilot Walt Smith spent several hours Monday whipping through 
high-speed vertical loops and fighting pressure that fluctuated between free 
fall and 4 Gs. 
</P>
<P>
 Sitting beside him the entire time was his wife, Evelyn. 
</P>
<P>
 This was not business back at the old stand for Smith. He and his wife were 
among nearly 500 members of American Coaster Enthusiasts spending two days at 
Six Flags Magic Mountain for ACE's 17th annual roller- coaster convention. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of the people I know don't like these things," said Evelyn Smith, 56, of 
Santa Ana. "I had to join a group like this to find people to talk about it." 
</P>
<P>
 While Evelyn Smith says she is too timid to climb into an experimental plane 
with her husband, a former test pilot for McDonnell Douglas, she is an avid 
roller-coaster fan and plans to ride "as long as our neck muscles hold out." 
</P>
<P>
 Her enjoyment of what she calls "controlled fear" contradicts her quiet 
appearance and that of the other ACE members. There are no leather flying 
helmets or other weird clothing to mark these people and their coaster calling. 
</P>
<P>
 Is it normal, though, to plan vacations around these wood and steel monoliths 
-- visiting parks across the country and riding hundreds of different 
roller-coasters, again and again? 
</P>
<P>
 "I talked with a psychiatrist about 15 years ago. She said thrill-seekers need 
adrenaline," said Ray Ueberroth, ACE president. "I know I enjoy looking at 
roller-coasters and anticipating what they're going to do to my body." 
</P>
<P>
 Ueberroth, 57, is a retired Maryland schoolteacher who said he has ridden more 
than 350 roller-coasters since his first at the age of 6. He remembers them 
all, but is continually surprised by new rides. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ten years ago, if you had told me I would have ridden on a coaster that had 
no floor, that looks like a ski lift gone berserk, I wouldn't have believed 
you," Ueberroth said, gesturing to the suspended track of Magic Mountain's new 
Batman: The Ride. 
</P>
<P>
 ACE has more than 4,500 members in 15 countries, and a survey showed the 
average member has ridden more than 60 roller-coasters and visits five 
different parks each year. Many consider themselves "coaster connoisseurs," 
evaluating individual rides as others do bottles of wine. 
</P>
<P>
 The Valencia theme park, delighted to support an organization devoted to 
spending a small fortune on amusement park rides, admitted the convention group 
two hours before the park's opening Monday and today, so they could enjoy 
Batman and the venerable Colossus ride without waiting in lines of amateur 
riders. 
</P>
<P>
 The ACE members seemed awfully normal as they enjoyed their peculiar passion. 
</P>
<P>
 No pushing or shoving. Just lots of picture-taking, friendly debates over what 
makes a good ride and comparing notes about the best drops, curves and trains 
they've experienced. 
</P>
<P>
 Loops are popular and many agree they like long falls and sharp turns. Whether 
to sit in the front or back car brings out differences of personal taste, and 
arguments over the merits of wood versus metal are never-ending. 
</P>
<P>
 "This kind of ride is good steel," said Mike McKinney, 40, gesturing to the 
Batman ride and its high-speed, spin-inducing track. The Vancouver resident has 
ridden nearly 200 roller-coasters, and quickly compares Valencia's Batman ride 
to its twin in Chicago. "The pacing isn't quite the same. This one has got 
another inversion that I liked, though." 
</P>
<P>
 Other riders, such as 25-year-old Ken Toghia, long for the clickety-clack of 
older coasters and their extra vibrations. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's something safer about a steel coaster," he adds, making it clear that 
for an adrenaline-starved ACE stalwart, that's too tame. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as every ride differs, so too do the reasons members have become involved 
in the group. 
</P>
<P>
 The desire to learn about the best roller-coasters is a common one, as are the 
social benefits of the group. Participants can sign up for trips and be paired 
with partners to share a hotel room and ride with. Many amusement parks also 
permit the group in before or after regular hours, allowing them to bypass 
lines. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like a living history for us," said Toghia, a onetime ride operator at 
Disneyland. Older ACE members "talk to us and tell us about coasters that no 
longer exist." 
</P>
<P>
 "You can start up a conversation with anybody," said McKinney. "You know 
you've got something in common."

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: NORTHRIDGE; 3RD BOMB FOUND AT NOBEL MIDDLE SCHOOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A steel-encased pipe bomb damaged an outside drinking fountain at Nobel Middle 
School in Northridge sometime over the weekend, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the third bomb exploded at the school in a week, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The first two bombs, which were exploded at the school last Wednesday, were 
encased in plastic pipe, said Officer Lorie Taylor of the Los Angeles Police 
Department. Those bombs were taped to a window, said Robert Coburn, an 
assistant principal at the school. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors told school officials they heard an explosion at the school Sunday 
night, Coburn said.  
</P>
<P>
 The latest bomb was taped to a porcelain water fountain near the girl's gym, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The bomb did minor damage to the pipes below the drinking fountain, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 The Police Department's bomb squad went to the school in the 9900 block of 
Tampa Avenue and picked up the remains of the bomb, Taylor said. CHIP JOHNSON

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE; PROPOSED BUDGET SEEKS NO NEW TAXES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JENNIFER OLDHAM 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Glendale's proposed $326-million 1994-95 fiscal year budget contains no new 
taxes, provides no increases in service levels and proposes only two new 
personnel. 
</P>
<P>
 City staff members and the City Council discussed the budget proposal, 
including the redevelopment agency budget and capital improvement projects, 
during a daylong study session Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials were forced to use "entrepreneurial government" to mend a predicted 
$3.1-million deficit in the budget proposal, said City Manager David Ramsay. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the deficit was caused by the stubborn recession and a drop in key 
revenues -- some provided to the city by the state -- such as property tax, 
sales tax, building permits and interest income. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials plan to balance the budget by increasing fees for other cities that 
dump trash at the Scholl Canyon Landfill and by selling methane gas generated 
by the landfill to the city's power company, said Ron Ahlers, executive 
assistant with the city's finance division. 
</P>
<P>
 This year's deficit was smaller than the $6-million gap that accompanied the 
$318-million 1993-94 budget, which forced officials to cut services. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1994-95 budget proposal includes $82 million for the city's General Fund. 
About 70% of this money is slated for public safety, public works and housing, 
health and community development. 
</P>
<P>
 Special revenue funds, including accounts set up to benefit transit, community 
development, housing assistance, the criminal apprehension program and the city 
redevelopment agency, total $36 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials predict servicing the city's debts will require $6 million. Capital 
improvement funds, set aside for development and renovation projects, account 
for $19 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the tough decisions faced by council members in approving this year's 
budget are allocating money for a proposed police facility -- which consultants 
have estimated could cost the city as much as $36 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members must also decide whether to provide redevelopment agency money 
to several theater groups that have asked the city to help them move to 
Glendale and to renovate a current theater facility. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials also are uncertain if negotiations with several city employees' 
unions will result in salary increases that were not planned for in the 1994-95 
budget proposal.  
</P>
<P>
 A public hearing on the budget has been scheduled during the City Council's 
afternoon meeting on June 21. The council is to vote on the budget June 28.

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: TARZANA; LESSONS HELP DOGS RENEW HERDING INSTINCT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KURT PITZER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 No, it's not some kind of twisted leadership seminar. 
</P>
<P>
 But on any given Tuesday or Saturday, a casual traveler along Reseda Boulevard 
in the Tarzana hills might notice teachers, entertainment executives or other 
professionals running around a dirt pen by the side of the road, barking orders 
at their dogs and learning to herd sheep. 
</P>
<P>
 "Get back, get back!" Anne Siphron, 26, shouted as Tucker, her border collie, 
dashed around several peevish-looking sheep. "Steady on." 
</P>
<P>
 Armed with a shepherd's crook and commands developed over several centuries in 
Scotland, Siphron and about two dozen other clients of the San Fernando Valley 
Herding Assn. spend several hours a week learning one of the world's oldest 
professions. 
</P>
<P>
 For most participants, though, it's a hobby that costs $25 per day. 
</P>
<P>
 "I come out to give Tucker some exercise," said Siphron, who took the morning 
off from her teaching job at Lincoln Middle School in Santa Monica. "Actually, 
I find it relaxing. This is a nice break from the classroom." 
</P>
<P>
 More and more, said Ken Dugan, who teaches herding at the Tarzana pen, owners 
of collies, bouviers, German shepherds and other breeds are turning to the 
ancient trade for recreation. 
</P>
<P>
 A decade ago, only three competitions in the sport were held in California, 
Dugan said, compared to about 15 now. 
</P>
<P>
 The small herding pens next to El Caballero Country Club in Tarzana -- the 
only such operation in the city of Los Angeles -- were set up last fall by Ted 
and Janna Ondrak, who took up herding with their border collie three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "For us, it was amazing to watch the instinct of the dogs kick in," said Ted 
Ondrak, a 37-year-old carpenter. "All of a sudden your pet changes, and you 
realize there's nothing in the world he'd rather do than be out there herding 
sheep." 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the Ondraks' clients enter their dogs in competitions, in which sheep 
-- or sometimes ducks -- are ferried through elaborate obstacle courses. 
</P>
<P>
 But many others -- including lawyers, teachers and several clients from the 
movie business -- seem to come "because they like to put on their jeans and get 
dirty," said Janna Ondrak, a legal secretary. 
</P>
<P>
 Screenwriter Harris Goldberg found himself doing most of the herding his first 
time out. 
</P>
<P>
 His 3-year-old border collie, also named Tucker, made a sluggish run at three 
sheep, then became distracted by one of the other dogs. 
</P>
<P>
 "He usually just sits at my feet under the computer," Goldberg said. "So I 
guess this is an improvement." KURT PITZER

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: BURBANK; AIRPORT'S BUDGET EXPECTED TO SOAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HENRY CHU 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A series of capital projects and land purchases during the next fiscal year 
will more than double Burbank Airport's current budget, while operational and 
maintenance expenses should remain fairly static, according to a proposed 
financial blueprint unveiled Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 For the new fiscal year beginning July 1, the Burbank-Glendale-Pasadena 
Airport Authority plans a number of expenditures that will push the budget past 
$56.4 million, more than twice the current $24.6-million budget.The expenses 
include expanding baggage-claim and parking-lot capacity, as well as buying 
adjacent land to help with noise mitigation and safety regulation. 
</P>
<P>
 Airport spokesman Victor Gill said the projects will be paid for by $15 
million in federal grants, $14 million in a bond issue the authority hopes to 
float later this year and $3 million through a facilities surcharge that will 
add $3 to each passenger's round-trip ticket. 
</P>
<P>
 Although officials still expect to construct a new 670,000-square-foot 
terminal over the next decade, the improvements planned for the coming year are 
mainly devoted to refurbishing the current buildings, Gill said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of them are related to making the current terminal livable for the 
remaining years," especially as passenger rolls continue to increase, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 To make the airport more attractive to airlines, the budget also envisions 
lower landing fees. But with a greater number of flights, the airport expects 
to generate about the same revenue in landing fees next year as this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The airport authority is scheduled to vote on the budget June 20. HENRY CHU

<P>
 The project, scheduled to be completed by August, 1995, will involve paving 
dirt shoulders, building guardrails, improving drainage, widening a bridge and 
removing one tree. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles County Department of Public Works will administer the project, 
which will be funded by Agoura Hills and the county.

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: TRAVEL AGENT OFFERS YEARS OF EXPERIENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF SCHNAUFER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 You've worked hard all your life and are ready to put your savings into a 
cruise around the world. Now, you walk into a travel agency to meet your agent, 
and there she is -- an 86-year-old woman who doesn't know how to work the 
computers. 
</P>
<P>
 Time to panic? Hardly. That's Alice Vail sitting there. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's probably forgotten more travel information than most agents know," said 
Sandy Orton, the manager at Wide World Tours in North Hollywood, where Vail 
comes once a week to book her tours. "She's very knowledgeable." 
</P>
<P>
 Eight times to the Far East, three times to the Holy Land and twice to Alaska, 
Vail may be the grandmother of all tour operators. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is easier to tell you where I haven't gone than where I have," said Vail, 
a North Hollywood resident who began organizing tours in 1958 when she returned 
from a trip to Europe and felt she could do a better job of leading a tour 
herself. 
</P>
<P>
 After studying with a Hollywood travel agent, the widowed mother of two built 
up a loyal clientele that has stayed with her for decades. Vail has acted as 
tour developer, booking agent and guide for her customers. 
</P>
<P>
 "She always made an interesting itinerary," said Irma Rochford, 81, of Studio 
City. "She is very young at heart." 
</P>
<P>
 Since Vail became her travel agent in 1977, Rochford has trekked with her on 
African safaris and cruises down the Jordan River. The two have also flown to 
Vail's favorite destination, the Orient, where Vail collects homemade Chinese 
throw rugs, darts in and out of Bangkok jewelry shops and loves to walk along 
the Great Wall of China. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to tons of souvenirs and photographs, three decades of travel have 
netted this golden globe-trotter one golden rule: Don't be late, because we 
don't wait. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll leave people if they aren't back at the bus on time," Vail said sternly. 
"It's not fair to make others wait for you. You can catch up." 
</P>
<P>
 Vail also has accumulated more travel tips than you can fit in an overhead 
compartment. Her favorite is the "Arlington Diet" -- a three-day plan, executed 
before you board the plane, to ward off jet lag. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately, Vail says, airplane trips have shortened during her tenure as a 
travel agent. Her first major tour group in 1961 featured 98 women flying for 
11 hours aboard a prop plane to Hawaii. In September, she will take a group on 
the supersonic Concorde to France. 
</P>
<P>
 But it may be a few years before there is an airplane fast enough to fly Vail 
and her group out of the few lands she has never visited -- for example, 
Greenland and Iceland. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody wants to go there," Vail said with a smile. JEFF SCHNAUFER

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SAN FERNANDO; STUDENT BILLBOARDS TO FIGHT ALCOHOL, DRUGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ED BOND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The dramatic image of a body being thrown through a car windshield -- soon to 
be on a northeast Valley billboard as part of an anti-alcohol and drug campaign 
-- becomes all the more persuasive upon meeting the artist. 
</P>
<P>
 "It happened to me," Ignacio Alvarado, 17, a junior at Sylmar High School, 
said after winning second place in the San Fernando-Pacoima Alcohol Prevention 
Coalition billboard contest. 
</P>
<P>
 Alvarado was 3 when he was thrown through the windshield in an accident. His 
father, who had been drinking, was at the wheel when he hit another car 
head-on, Alvarado said. Despite his age at the time of the accident, Alvarado 
still has flashbacks in which he sees the crash. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was difficult," Alvarado said about creating the billboard, adding that it 
was important for him to get the anti-alcohol message across. 
</P>
<P>
 Alvarado's friend and fellow art class student Carlos Martinez took first 
place for a billboard design of the devil, symbolizing the disastrous effects 
of drinking. Martinez said he had figured that Alvarado would win.  
</P>
<P>
 "He had more detail," said Martinez, who will spend the $300 prize money on 
his 4-month-old daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 Students from 15 elementary, middle and high schools in San Fernando, Sylmar 
and Pacoima submitted 340 entries in the billboard contest, which coalition 
leaders hope will become an annual event to combat the influence of billboards 
that promote alcoholic beverages. 
</P>
<P>
 Contest winners were named in a ceremony last week, but organizers said that 
any of the entries can still be used as a billboard.  
</P>
<P>
 By an arrangement with billboard companies, the coalition can put up as many 
as 15 billboards with anti-drug and alcohol messages. Five billboards are 
available for a three-month period and the coalition can put up different 
billboards each month. 
</P>
<P>
 While not as artistically mature as some of the high school entries, the 
drawings and simple messages of elementary students also have an impact. 
</P>
<P>
 Their entries were split into two categories -- Spanish and English language. 
</P>
<P>
 Winners and some of the other contest entries were shown in a slide show at 
the San Fernando Middle School, with slogans such as: " Por Favor No Toma " 
(Please Don't Drink); "Don't Drink, Have Fun With Your Family;" "There's No 
Hope in Dope;" "Choose Booze and Loose, Stay Dry and Fly;" and " Es Borracho No 
Es Macho " (He's Drunk He's Not Macho.) 
</P>
<P>
 One entry showed a baby in its mother's womb begging the mother not to drink. 
Another simply said, "My cousin Jerry got hit by a drunk driver." ED BOND

<P>
 A 19-year-old Oakland man was fatally shot as he sat in his car outside a Sun 
Valley apartment building, Los Angeles police said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Patrol officers who were responding Sunday to a report of gunshots found 
Everado Loza slumped over in his car, which was parked at an apartment complex 
in the 7000 block of Bakman Avenue, said LAPD Detective Mike Coffey.Loza was 
pronounced dead at the scene by paramedics about 9:30 p.m. He had been shot 
several times in the upper torso, Coffey said. 
</P>
<P>
 Loza, who had recently moved to Oakland, was visiting relatives in Sun Valley, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators are unsure as to why Loza was at the apartment building where he 
was shot and know of no motive for the attack, Coffey said. No arrests had been 
made as of late Monday. TIMOTHY WILLIAMS

<P>
 A 2-year-boy died about an hour after he was plucked from a swimming pool that 
he fell into Monday, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The unidentified victim was pulled from the pool by family members at a house 
in the 8000 block of Strathern Avenue, said Brian Humphrey, a Los Angeles Fire 
Department spokesman. No one witnessed the accident, Humphrey said. 
</P>
<P>
 The child was placed on life support systems and taken to Pacifica Hospital of 
the Valley in nearby Sun Valley, Humphrey said. He was pronounced dead at 3:45 
p.m., a nursing supervisor said.

UNIVERSAL SUED OVER ALLEGED HARASSMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN ABRAHAMSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Honor student and Boy Scout Henry Helmer Jr. found himself detained, 
interrogated and, he says, humiliated and harassed at Universal Studios, 
accused of stealing sunglasses that, it turns out, weren't even offered for 
sale at any amusement park souvenir stand. 
</P>
<P>
 He claims he was singled out solely because he has brown skin -- he is of 
African-American and Filipino descent -- and because he was wearing earrings 
and homemade baggy pants. 
</P>
<P>
 "Based on how I look, to have people think, 'He'll steal something,' it's 
disturbing," Helmer said. "That this kind of stuff still happens . . . that's 
an outrage." 
</P>
<P>
 Contending that his civil rights were violated during the incident last May, 
Helmer and his family sued Universal last month. At issue, the family's 
attorney said, is whether park employees discriminate against minorities 
because of the color of their skin or the style and color of their clothes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Universal's harassment of this young man and his family had nothing to do 
with conduct, only with appearance," lawyer Sally Kilburg said. "We feel it was 
a close encounter of the illegal kind." 
</P>
<P>
 A spokeswoman for the park, Joan Bullard, declined to comment on the suit. "We 
don't believe in trying our cases in the press," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The case, filed in Alameda Superior Court, exemplifies a tension that surfaces 
with some frequency at California's amusement parks, several of which have been 
hit in recent years with lawsuits alleging discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
 The parks go far to promote an atmosphere of wholesome and safe family 
entertainment. Critics allege that they sometimes go too far, denying admission 
to would-be patrons they identify as suspected troublemakers -- when that 
identification is based on race, appearance or mannerisms. 
</P>
<P>
 Six Flags Magic Mountain, the Valencia-based amusement park, has been a 
particular target of criticism. 
</P>
<P>
 Sparked by a 1985 melee involving three San Fernando Valley gangs, Magic 
Mountain has adopted a screening policy that relies in part on "profiles" of 
suspected gang members to keep out weapons, drugs and alcohol. Park officials 
say the policy has been effective. Civil liberties groups allege that the 
profiles unfairly stereotype minorities. 
</P>
<P>
 Bullard said Universal Studios has no such screening policy. Nor, she said, 
does the park single out minority youths for special attention from security 
guards. "There is no such policy," she said. "Never has been. Never will be." 
</P>
<P>
 Helmer, however, said that guards accused him repeatedly while he was detained 
of being in a gang. "It scared me," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident, according to the lawsuit, took place during a trip in May, 1993, 
that had been planned as a family vacation to several Southern California 
amusement parks. Helmer, then 19, had just returned home to San Francisco from 
his first year in college. 
</P>
<P>
 The trip began with a visit to Disneyland. At an Anaheim hotel, Helmer bought 
a pair of gold-rimmed sunglasses with violet-tinted lenses. They cost $6, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Two days later, on May 22, 1993, Helmer, his younger brother and their parents 
arrived at Universal Studios. Park staff took a photo of them entering the park 
-- with Helmer, then 19, wearing his new tinted shades, his earrings and his 
baggy pants. 
</P>
<P>
 A few hours later, Helmer went browsing in a souvenir stand. When he rejoined 
his family at a nearby cafe, he was suddenly confronted by security guards who 
accused him of stealing a pair of sunglasses, according to the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 The store clerk said that the violet-tinted glasses were the stolen shades, 
and identified Helmer as the culprit, the suit said. Security guards then 
walked Helmer across the park to a detention center. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt like a complete idiot," Helmer said. "I was embarrassed at the whole 
situation. Here I was, surrounded by all these security guards, off to the 
detention office with all these people looking at me, like, 'Look at this 
criminal, he got caught, ha ha ha.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Several hours later, Helmer said, a park merchandising official informed 
guards that the $6 violet-tinted sunglasses could not have been stolen because 
the souvenir stand did not carry that model. With that, he said, he was 
released. 
</P>
<P>
 "It looked as if they were disappointed to let me go," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 As the family made its way out, according to the suit, words were exchanged 
between a security guard and Helmer's younger brother, Zelman Helmer, then 16. 
The guard looked like he was going to hit the younger brother, and said to the 
father, Henry Helmer Sr., "You better get your boy out of here before there's 
trouble," according to the suit. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit alleges violations of Henry Helmer Jr.'s civil rights. It also 
includes claims of false imprisonment, assault, infliction of emotional 
distress. It seeks unspecified damages. 
</P>
<P>
 Named as defendants were Universal City Studios Inc., the company that runs 
the park; parent corporation MCA Inc., and American Protective Services Inc., 
which the suit identifies as the firm that provides security at the park. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyers for American Protective Services did not return a call seeking 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit was filed May 20 in Alameda Superior Court because the security firm 
is based in Oakland, Kilburg said. 
</P>
<P>
 Park officials offered the family free passes for a return visit, Henry Helmer 
Sr. said. "We just threw (the passes) out," he said.

COURT REVIVES BERNSON'S LIBEL SUIT, EXTENDING STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANN W. O'NEILL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a decision that surprised attorneys for both sides, the state Supreme Court 
on Monday reinstated Los Angeles City Councilman Hal Bernson's lawsuit against 
a Granada Hills landfill operator and a political consultant, who Bernson 
contends leaked false information about his travel expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 The justices ruled 4 to 2 that the usual one-year time limit for filing libel 
lawsuits can be extended when defendants accused of disseminating allegedly 
defamatory material intentionally conceal their identities. 
</P>
<P>
 Writing for the majority, Justice Arman Arabian waxed poetic, borrowing from 
Shakespeare:  
</P>
<P>
 "Stolen property may be replaced or recovered but where does one go to restore 
one's reputation? In the imortal words of Shakespeare's Iago: 'Who steals my 
purse steals trash. 'Twas mine, and 'tis his and has been slave to thousands; 
but he that filches from me my good name robs me of that which not enriches him 
and makes me poor indeed." 
</P>
<P>
 The court ruled that when a defendant "intentionally cloaked its identity, 
factors of fairness and unjust enrichment come into play," and that "equity and 
good conscience" dictate that the statute of limitations be lifted in such 
libel cases. 
</P>
<P>
 The justices sent Bernson's suit back to Los Angeles Superior Court for trial 
-- six years after Bernson claims he was smeared in a 36-page dossier, called 
"Los Angeles Councilman Hal Bernson -- An Analysis of City/Campaign Financial 
Travel 1983-1988," circulated anonymously to Los Angeles media representatives. 
The dossier claimed Bernson used campaign and city funds for personal expenses, 
including "extensive personal travel" in Europe and Asia and suggested such 
expenditures were "unusual" and "legally questionable," according to the 
court's opinion. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernson contends that Browning-Ferris Industries was behind the dossier. 
Bernson and BFI battled politically for years over the company's attempts to 
expand the Sunshine Canyon dump in Granada Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the opinion, Bernson said he received a copy of the dossier in 
1988, but did not suspect who circulated it until two Los Angeles Times 
reporters told him during an interview in February, 1990, that they believed it 
was BFI. A BFI attorney at that time denied the company was the source, and 
demanded a retraction from the newspaper. The opinion said that Bernson 
contends that in May, 1991, another Times reporter told a Bernson aide that 
political consultant Mark Ryavec prepared the dossier on BFI's behalf. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernson's travel expenses were widely reported and criticized in published 
reports. In 1990, The Times reported that between 1987 and 1989, Bernson spent 
more than $120,000 in campaign funds on travel, often flying first class and 
staying in expensive hotels. He traveled to Paris, Hong King, Italy, London, 
Beijing, Israel, Hawaii and New Orleans, outspending then-Gov. George 
Deukmejian. 
</P>
<P>
 But no evidence was found that Bernson had broken any laws. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernson filed the suit, seeking $20 million in damages, in January, 1992. 
Named as defendants were Browning-Ferris Industries; BFI Vice President Les 
Bittenson; and political consultants Mark Ryavec and Lynn Wessell, who has 
since died. 
</P>
<P>
 BFI still denies that it played any role in preparing or distributing the 
dossier, company attorney Steven Weston said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernson had no comment on the court's decision, but aide Grieg Smith said, "We 
are elated." "This sends a message that you can't slander and libel people and 
be malicious, and then just hide for a year and let the harm go by," said 
Bernson's lawyer, Neil Papiano. "It's a major new rule, one that I think is 
proper." 
</P>
<P>
 "I think what the court is saying is the identity of a defendant must be known 
before a libel action is filed," BFI attorney Weston said. "It changes the 
law." 
</P>
<P>
 He added that his clients "look forward to trying the case on its merits. . . 
. We look forward to questioning the councilman about his expenditures." 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Winslow, attorney for consultant Ryavec, said he was disappointed by the 
court's decision and the change in the law it created. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm unhappy," Winslow said. "I thought we had a very sound statute of 
limitations defense and we're now talking about a situation where we're going 
to have to try to figure out what Mr. Bernson's reputation was like back in 
1988. If this case goes to trial, we're going to be using rather old evidence, 
and in general that doesn't help the search for the truth." 
</P>
<P>
 And, Winslow said, the case will likely raise another other fundamental legal 
issue -- free speech: "Inquiry about the propriety of expenditures by elected 
public officials is as much what the First Amendment is about as practically 
anything, in my opinion."

CASES CLOSED IN 2 LAPD SHOOTINGS; LAW ENFORCEMENT: FOLLOWING INVESTIGATIONS, 
PROSECUTORS WILL NOT SEEK CHARGES AGAINST TWO OFFICERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 County prosecutors said Monday they will not seek criminal charges against two 
Los Angeles Police Department detectives involved in separate shooting 
incidents in the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Detective Paul Stewart of the West Valley Division did not break the law when 
he accidentally fired his pistol last July while trying to take four 
purse-snatching suspects into custody, prosecutors concluded. 
</P>
<P>
 Stewart was driving an unmarked police car when he heard a radio call 
describing four men traveling in a blue Chevrolet who had snatched the purse of 
an elderly woman. Stewart spotted a car that matched the suspects' Chevrolet 
and followed the car as it pulled into a Burger King parking lot at Eton Avenue 
and Sherman Way. 
</P>
<P>
 The detective drew his 9-millimeter pistol and ordered the four men to stay in 
the car, but one of them jumped out and ran. The pistol discharged when Stewart 
repositioned it. 
</P>
<P>
 The bullet struck but did not injure Onesimo Martinez, who was sitting inside 
his truck parked more than block away. 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter to the police commission last month, Deputy Dist. Atty. Joseph D. 
Shidler determined the shooting was accidental and that no crime was committed. 
 
</P>
<P>
 In a separate case, Shidler said his office determined that Detective John 
Edwards, a homicide investigator assigned to the Van Nuys Division, used 
justifiable force when he fired a round that pierced the earlobe of a fleeing 
suspect. 
</P>
<P>
 Oscar Tejeda, who was being sought for questioning in a murder case, drove a 
stolen car in May of last year into a motorcycle officer during a pursuit.

<P>
 During a subsequent foot pursuit, Edwards fired four rounds from his 
9-millimeter pistol at Tejeda, one of which pierced Tejeda's ear. 
</P>
<P>
 Police later discovered Tejeda hiding under a parked car at a nearby apartment 
building. He was found guilty last August of assault with a deadly weapon on a 
peace officer, felony hit and run, and grand-theft auto and was sentenced to 
five years and four months in state prison.

<P>
 It is routine procedure for the district attorney's office to investigate all 
officer-involved shootings. Conclusions drawn from the investigations are used 
by prosecutors to determine whether to file criminal charges against officers.

VALLEY INTERVIEW; ALARCON HOPEFUL ON POST-GM JOBS, BUT DEAL'S NOT DONE IN A DAY 
</P>

 Since the General Motors plant in Panorama City closed in August, 1992, 
eliminating 2,600 jobs, city officials have worked with GM representatives to 
try to find a buyer for the 100-acre plant in hopes of replacing some of the 
lost jobs. The plant's closure sent a ripple through the area's economy, 
dramatically reducing business in area restaurants, bars and shops. Councilman 
Richard Alarcon, who took office last year representing a district that 
includes Panorama City, has taken a lead role in finding a new occupant for the 
site. He was asked about the progress in this effort by Times staff writer Hugo 
Martin. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Question: How much of an impact would you say the closure of the GM plant has 
had on the San Fernando Valley and the neighboring community?  
</P>
<P>
 Answer: It had two significant impacts on the San Fernando Valley. First, 
symbolically it represented the wealth of our area: good-paying jobs, good 
products, America at its best. Symbolically it damaged the spirit of the 
workers and the people who were somehow affiliated with the plant, whether they 
were subcontractors or vendors to the plant or even small businesses, such as 
restaurants along the corridor. 
</P>
<P>
 As a practical reality, it certainly caused some interesting repercussions 
that I don't think people initially understood. A lot of people, family and 
friends became long-term unemployed but are still receiving the benefits from 
the contract that was there. But the strangest thing was that people are now 
living in places like Georgia or have moved to Tennessee where GM has 
transferred them. So, it has caused some dislocation of longstanding community 
members and that is unfortunate because it takes some of the history of the 
Valley away. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Are the effects still apparent or have you seen a slow recovery happening?  
</P>
<P>
 A. First of all, the contract that was in place when the plant closed allowed 
for a less visible devastation because the workers are still under contract, 
still receiving benefits from that contract. Some of them are in school. Some 
of them are retraining for other kinds of employment. So, it wasn't as if the 
plant just shut down and everybody was unemployed, which would have had a 
devastating effect on the northeast Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 But nevertheless, a week doesn't go by that I don't run across someone who 
once worked there. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. There are a lot of restaurants around the plant that were affected. Have 
those started to recover?  
</P>
<P>
 A. Not really. The lunch places suffered and they are still suffering and I 
think some of the other business in the area that served the workers of the 
plant certainly are suffering from it. They never recovered. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Is getting a new occupant in GM a high priority for you?  
</P>
<P>
 A. It's certainly high on my priority list to the extent that there is real 
opportunity. If there is something substantive, then we will shift gears and 
address it. I mean there are other priorities in my district. 
</P>
<P>
 But clearly it's a big issue, and if there is an opportunity we will make room 
to focus on it. I would say we are in that phase now. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Before it closed, you were former Mayor Tom Bradley's aide in the Valley. 
Was there any effort to keep the plant from closing or reduce the effects the 
closure would have on the area?  
</P>
<P>
 A. Absolutely. I was very much involved with trying to establish a task force 
for General Motors. I worked very close to Assemblyman Richard Katz and 
Congressman Howard Berman's office in an effort to forestall the closure. In 
that capacity we set up a meeting with Mayor Bradley, Berman, Katz and 
Supervisor Ed Edelman, and we sat down with General Motors. I also put together 
a group of about 105 business representatives, homeowner groups and elected 
officials in a major meeting in that same effort. 
</P>
<P>
 The intent was going to be to form a task force that would have a 
three-pronged goal. The first goal was to stop the closure. The second goal was 
if we couldn't stop the closure to devise a plan to make it recover as quickly 
as possible. And the third was to find a specialized industry to be drawn in. 
</P>
<P>
 The mayor was very sensitive that we worked very closely with City Councilman 
Ernani Bernardi (who represented the area at that time). So when Bernardi 
recommended that we put the task force under the city's Community Development 
Department, we didn't oppose that. Unfortunately, from my perspective, when it 
went to the Community Development Department, it lost the impetus. So, those 
105 people that we had gathered as a task force disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. What has happened?  
</P>
<P>
 A. Well, CDD would meet but the task force in their definition included only 
city bureaucrats. It didn't include the political spectrum. It didn't include 
the business spectrum. It didn't include the unions. It was a very limited 
group. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the first things I told to one official who was responsible for that 
was: "Why didn't you include those groups that we put in there?" And their 
response was: "Because we knew it would be a long-term endeavor to make the 
plant productive." I don't think that is the case. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Is there any progress finding a new tenant now?  
</P>
<P>
 A. There is progress, but you don't want to be overly hopeful. There's been 
several different potential deals in the works since I've been in office and 
sometimes you think you are very close to something and it changes. But I'm 
very encouraged. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. What do you think is the main reason these deals have fallen through? Is it 
the recession or the site itself?  
</P>
<P>
 A. There's a variety of reasons why. First of all, it's time. You can't put 
together a deal in a day. It takes some time and some consideration and then 
you have to see what the various alternatives and options are and who is 
interested. Clearly we are not in the best economy and that has had some 
impact. But there are people that continue to call about the site. 
</P>
<P>
 But as I've said, you have to believe that you can do something with it. One 
of the issues we cleared up when we sat down with General Motors was that I 
will not sacrifice prime manufacturing land for commercial retail. My fear is 
the negative impact it will have on the nearby Panorama Mall. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm not unwilling to discuss the potential for commercial retail if we are 
talking about a segment of the site and getting a manufacturing plant of a 
smaller scale on another side of the lot. 
</P>
<P>
 There have been commercial retail interests that have made it clear that they 
want to move in but I don't want give up on manufacturing. I'm concerned about 
the impact on the Panorama Mall. We are gearing to build up the Panorama Mall. 
It would be a contradiction to build up a huge shopping mall a few blocks away. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. What would you see as the best scenario for the site? What you would like 
to see happen?  
</P>
<P>
 A. I can't get very specific at all because I don't want to foreclose on any 
options that may arise. But I would like to see a concentrated number of jobs. 
We lost more than 2,000 jobs on this site. I would like to see 2,000 jobs on 
the site that pay at least $10 an hour. The average wage before was $15 an hour 
so I think that would be a reasonable goal. 
</P>
<P>
 But there may be a combination of operations. It may take five different 
businesses in there if you parcel it out to get up to that. Some of those jobs 
may be on the lower end, some on the higher end. But I know right now we are 
talking to one company where the average wage is well over that. We are really 
encouraged. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Have potential buyers raised the issue about possible soil contamination at 
the site?  
</P>
<P>
 A. I think it's always something people are going to ask. General Motors has 
said the problem relative to soil contamination has passed, that several years 
ago their paint operation generated some issues with that. But they cleaned it 
up. 
</P>
<P>
 I think we are not going to finally know until it actually goes into escrow 
and the buyers start doing their own tests. We have General Motor's word that 
there is no significant contamination of any kind. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Previously you talked about the city acting as a middleman between GM and a 
potential buyer. Is that still an option?  
</P>
<P>
 A. That was one of my ideas. I asked General Motors early on to explore the 
potential tax benefits of allowing the city, through some nonprofit vehicle, to 
being a pass-through. When they did that analysis they determined that if their 
property was appraised at a certain value -- I think it was $9 million -- that 
they could accrue some benefits. But when the appraisal actually did come in it 
was a lot less than they projected. So we are not holding to that formula. 
</P>
<P>
 We basically wanted to let General Motors know that the city was willing to 
find new ways to do business, to make business. I think that message is clear.

20-SCREEN THEATER COMPLEX PLANNED FOR WARNER CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICE APODACA and CHIP JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Pacific Theatres Corp. said Monday it plans to build what will be the largest 
movie theater complex in Los Angeles County in Woodland Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles-based company said it hopes to break ground on the 20-screen 
theater complex in a few months when it expects to have the necessary permits, 
and will try to open sometime between Thanksgiving, 1995, and the end of that 
year.  
</P>
<P>
 Larry Friedman, the Los Angeles city planner assigned to Warner Center, where 
the project will be located, said it is conceivable that the permit process 
could allow for construction that soon. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the kind of project that would probably be appropriate within the Warner 
Center area," Friedman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Warner Center Specific Plan has established pre-approved design plans that 
allow for the construction of high density projects in the area, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The traffic plan for the project is now under review by the city's Department 
of Transportation, Friedman said. It is the first step before the project and 
parking plans are submitted to the city's Planning and Building and Safety 
departments, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 An environmental impact report was prepared for the site in 1993, when West 
Valley Partnership, composed of CenterMark Properties and heirs of the Warner 
family, submitted a proposal to build a 355,000-square-foot mixed use project, 
said John Lyda, the development director for CenterMark Properties. 
</P>
<P>
 Lyda said the partnership is currently "in negotiations" with Pacific Theatres 
and he expected that the two sides would reach a lease agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed theaters would be located at the corner of Victory and Topanga 
Canyon boulevards. CenterMark Properties also owns the Topanga Plaza shopping 
center across the street. 
</P>
<P>
 If approved without changes, the theater complex will include 4,500 seats and 
1,500 ground-level parking spaces. The theaters will encompass about 70,000 
square feet. 
</P>
<P>
 A three-screen theater owned by CenterMark next to the site, operated by 
Pacific Theatres, will probably be converted to retail use, said Dan Chernow, 
vice president and general manager of Pacific Theatres. 
</P>
<P>
 Chernow said the new theater complex would cost in the multimillion-dollar 
range, but declined to be more specific. "This is the most ambitious project 
we've ever been involved with," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pacific Theatres is also considering including a motion-simulation theater at 
one of the theaters in the complex, said Milton Moritz, the company's 
vice-president of advertising.

FORMER DOCTOR GETS 13 YEARS IN SEXUAL ASSAULTS; COURTS: YAHYA LAVI WAS 
CONVICTED FOR ATTACKS ON FOUR FEMALE PATIENTS. PROSECUTORS HAD SOUGHT A 37-YEAR 
TERM. 
</P>

<P>
 A former Brentwood doctor was sentenced to 13 years in prison Monday for 
sexually assaulting four female patients, including two women who were patients 
at a Panorama City clinic. 
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court Judge Charles Horan imposed the sentence on Yahya Lavi, 56, 
during a hearing in Downtown Los Angeles, despite pleas by prosecutors to 
impose a tougher 37-year prison term. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Beatriz Donoghue, who described Lavi's actions as 
"reprehensible" and "predatory," said she was satisfied with the sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope this sentence sends a message to medical professionals that if they 
attempt to abuse their positions by taking sexual advantage of their patients 
then they can expect to face the same repercussions . . . as this former 
doctor," Donoghue said in an interview after the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 Donoghue said she hopes Lavi's case also sends a message to female patients to 
report any sexual assaults they suffer at the hands of medical personnel. 
</P>
<P>
 A jury convicted Lavi, a decertified orthopedic surgeon, in April of 10 felony 
and criminal counts of sexual battery and rape, and penetration with a foreign 
object when a victim is unconscious of the nature of the act. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors alleged that Lavi took advantage of women who sought medical 
treatment from him as part of the requirements to receive workers' compensation 
benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 Donoghue described all of Lavi's victims as Latinas, born outside this 
country, with little education. She said the women thought Lavi was following 
proper medical procedure when he fondled their breasts and vaginas. 
</P>
<P>
 "He exploited their lack of familiarity with customs of this country," 
Donoghue said. "He lured them to his office under the pretense that they needed 
treatment for serious medical conditions that they did not in fact have." 
</P>
<P>
 In one case, Lavi drove one of the women from a medical clinic to his office, 
where he gave her a pill that made her dizzy and then sexually assaulted her, 
Donoghue alleged. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorneys contended that the women made up the rape allegations 
because the doctor was going to stop signing workers' compensation reports, 
which allowed them to receive disability payments. 
</P>
<P>
 Audrey Winograde, an attorney representing Lavi, said her client maintains his 
innocence. 
</P>
<P>
 "The family is devastated," Winograde said. "The doctor was essentially 
catatonic (at Monday's hearing). He couldn't speak." 
</P>
<P>
 The attorney said Lavi's life was over. 
</P>
<P>
 "He no longer has a medical license and he no longer has the respect of his 
community," Winograde said. "It's as bad as the death penalty." 
</P>
<P>
 Donoghue had sought a 37-year prison term for Lavi. However, Judge Horan sided 
with defense attorneys who cited case law to support their argument that 13 
years should be the maximum sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors had originally charged Lavi, who worked at several Los Angeles 
health clinics in addition to his private practice in Brentwood, with 20 counts 
of drugging, raping and sexually assaulting five women. A jury was unable to 
reach a decision on counts charging Lavi with drugging some of the women. 
</P>
<P>
 Lavi worked at offices in Los Angeles, Panorama City, Lancaster, Long Beach, 
Covina and Pasadena.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; FUND ESTABLISHED FOR GIRLS KILLED IN CRASH 
</P>

 A memorial fund for three girls killed in an automobile accident last week has 
been established to help pay for their funerals, which are set for this week. 
</P>
<P>
 JoKema Du Bois and Gena Watkinson, both 15, and 3 1/2-year-old Jesica Noell 
were killed when the car Du Bois was driving crossed the center line of Seco 
Canyon Road and slammed into two vehicles driving in the opposite direction. 
Two other girls in the car, Alicia Acevedo and Du Bois' sister, Barbara, both 
14, were seriously injured. 
</P>
<P>
 The girls were coming home from a church youth group last Wednesday when the 
accident occurred. JoKema Du Bois was too young to legally drive. Family 
members said she had taken her grandmother's car without permission. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbara Du Bois was listed in critical condition Monday at Northridge Hospital 
Medical Center with numerous broken bones and a punctured lung, said Deborah 
Moore, a hospital spokeswoman. Acevedo is listed in serious condition with a 
broken leg and head injury. 
</P>
<P>
 Occupants of the other vehicles were not seriously injured. 
</P>
<P>
 The memorial fund was established by the Santa Clarita Elks Lodge because the 
families do not have the resources to pay for the funerals, said Judy Saunders, 
a friend of Mary McWilliams, the Du Bois' grandmother and guardian. 
</P>
<P>
 "The funerals are going to be before the memorial fund is (paid), but this 
will help the families reimburse the expenses," Saunders said. 
</P>
<P>
 The fund will be divided between the families according to need, she added. 
</P>
<P>
 JoKema Du Bois' funeral is scheduled for 2 p.m. today at Eternal Valley 
Memorial Park, 23287 Sierra Highway. Also scheduled at the memorial park are a 
graveside service for Watkinson at 11 a.m. Wednesday and a private service for 
Noell's family Thursday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 Donations may be made to the Memorial and Medical Fund, c/o the Santa Clarita 
Elks Lodge, P.O. Box 1326, Canyon Country, Calif., 91351.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; DEFENDANT FAILS TO REMOVE JUDGE; COURTS: DAVID 
HOOKER, WHO FACES DEATH PENALTY FOR HIS ALLEGED ROLE IN A FIRE THAT KILLED HIS 
ADOPTIVE FATHER, CHARGED BIAS. 
</P>

<P>
 A Littlerock man, accused of joining his stepmother in setting a fire that 
killed his adoptive father, made an unsuccessful attempt Monday to remove the 
judge hearing his case. 
</P>
<P>
 David Warren Hooker, 32, acting as his own attorney, filed papers alleging 
that Antelope Municipal Court Judge Ian R. Grant is prejudiced and should not 
be permitted to preside over Hooker's preliminary hearing. Hooker said Grant is 
biased because the judge had told him he was foolish to represent himself in a 
death penalty case. 
</P>
<P>
 Grant ruled Monday that Hooker did not submit his papers on time and did not 
have sufficient legal grounds to disqualify the judge. Although he acknowledged 
that he had urged Hooker not to serve as his own attorney, Grant said he was 
not biased. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've bent over backwards to protect your rights," the judge said. 
</P>
<P>
 Because there was insufficient time Monday, Grant ordered the preliminary 
hearing postponed until June 15. At that hearing, the judge must decide whether 
there is enough evidence to order a trial for David Hooker and his stepmother, 
Joy Girard Hooker, 50. 
</P>
<P>
 The two, who allegedly were lovers, are accused of setting fire to their 
Littlerock house on April 19, 1993, to collect insurance money. The two fled 
the burning house and rescued the family dog, but left Thomas Hooker, a 
58-year-old retired LAPD officer who was legally blind and suffering from 
diabetes, inside to die, investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hooker had often boasted that he was the inspiration for the 1980s television 
show "T. J. Hooker," although the show's creator denied it. Joy Hooker was his 
third wife. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday's court ruling marked the latest delay in a yearlong effort to 
prosecute the Hookers on murder and arson charges. If convicted, the two could 
face the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Ron Smalstig said he believed David Hooker was trying to 
use legal tricks to prolong the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Laizer D. Gould, the attorney for Joy Hooker, did not join the attempt to 
disqualify the judge. "Mrs. Hooker has been ready, willing and able to go to a 
preliminary hearing for some time," Gould said. "She wants to get moving."

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; MAN SENTENCED IN ATM KILLING; CRIME: AFTER 
PLEA BARGAIN, WESLEY HARPER, 24, GETS 26 YEARS TO LIFE FOR ROLE IN 1993 MURDER 
OUTSIDE A LANCASTER BANK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Wesley Harper was sentenced to 26 years to life Monday for his role in a 1993 
murder near an automatic teller machine outside a Lancaster bank. 
</P>
<P>
 Lancaster Superior Court Judge Haig Kehiayan sentenced Harper to 25 years to 
life for first-degree murder. Kehiayan added an additional year because 
Harper's co-defendant was armed with a gun. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Pamela Rogers said the sentence was exactly what she was 
seeking. It comes in the wake of a plea bargain which required Harper to plead 
guilty to the murder charge and testify against Christopher Arthur Mann, who is 
accused of having fatally shot Hans Christian Herzog, 44. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the counts Harper was facing prior to the plea, he could have been 
sentenced to life without the possibility of parole, said Rogers. 
</P>
<P>
 Rogers said even with the plea, Harper, 24, will serve 28 years in state 
prison before he is even considered for parole. 
</P>
<P>
 "By the time he gets out, he won't be much danger to anyone," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Early in the morning of March 5, 1993, Harper drove a pickup truck in which 
Mann was a passenger. Prosecutors said the pair were looking for someone to rob 
at an ATM when they came across Herzog outside a Lancaster Boulevard branch of 
Bank of America. 
</P>
<P>
 According to investigators, Mann fatally shot Herzog with a sawed-off rifle 
provided to him by Harper, and then stole Herzog's car. 
</P>
<P>
 During the sentencing, Rogers read a statement from Herzog's widow, Verena, 
into the record. The statement read in part, "Mr. Harper, one of the saddest 
facts of all is that, whatever you and Mann so desperately desired and killed 
for, my beloved husband would have freely given you. For Hans was always ready 
to help one in need, he was one of the most giving and caring men a person 
could know." 
</P>
<P>
 Rogers said Harper has already provided a videotaped statement about the 
incident that will be used against Mann during his trial, which is scheduled to 
begin Aug. 24. Harper is also expected to testify at Mann's trial. 
</P>
<P>
 "His testimony will be invaluable," she said, adding that it will allow the 
jury to "understand the random and cold-blooded nature of the killing." 
</P>
<P>
 The district attorney's office is seeking the death penalty for Mann.

TELEVISION SHOW SEEKS TO RE-CREATE CHP SLAYINGS; CRIME: FOUR OFFICERS WERE 
GUNNED DOWN AT A ROADSIDE CAFE IN NEWHALL 24 YEARS AGO. THE INCIDENT CHANGED 
POLICE PROCEDURES.

 It has been called the worst of tragedies for the California Highway Patrol, 
and now some of the survivors are re-creating it for television. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty-four years ago, four highway patrolmen were gunned down and killed at a 
roadside cafe in Newhall. The incident changed the way CHP officers go about 
their business. 
</P>
<P>
 Harry Ingold, 50, now a police sergeant in West Los Angeles, was a CHP officer 
in 1970. He arrived at the roadside cafe moments after two men shot the four 
officers and fled just after midnight on April 6. Now Ingold is helping to 
re-enact the incident for "Real Stories of the Highway Patrol." 
</P>
<P>
 "They're not asking me for help, but they're willing to listen," said Ingold, 
who is playing the same role for television that he did 24 years ago. "If I 
find a problem, they'll usually listen and readily correct it." 
</P>
<P>
 Ingold said that reliving the events of the shooting has been difficult, but 
he has no regrets about being part of the filming. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been fun to be here, even though it brings out some vivid memories," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Real Stories" filmed the seven-minute episode last week at an abandoned gas 
station on California 126, about 12 miles west of where the slayings took 
place. Almost all of the parts, except for the suspects, were played by law 
enforcement officers. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're better than actors for this particular role," said Mark Massari, the 
show's executive producer. "They live it every day of their lives and they know 
instinctively how to react in these situations." 
</P>
<P>
 Killed in the 1970 incident were officers Walter C. Fargo, 23; George M. 
Alleyn, 24; James E. Pence Jr., 25; and Roger D. Gore, 23. All were married and 
were fathers. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident began just before midnight when Jack Twining, 35, and Bobby 
Augusta Davis, 29, brandished guns at a motorist on Interstate 5 near Gorman, 
according to an official account published by the CHP. The motorist reported 
the incident to the CHP, and Gore and Frago went to investigate. 
</P>
<P>
 The two officers spotted Davis and Twining in a car parked outside J's Coffee 
Shop on what is now the Old Road, near the intersection of Magic Mountain 
Parkway. The officers approached the car and began questioning the men. 
</P>
<P>
 Without warning, Frago was shot twice in the chest with a .357 magnum and died 
instantly. Gore was killed seconds later when two shots from a .38-caliber 
revolver hit him in the chest. 
</P>
<P>
 Pence and Alleyn arrived soon afterward and a gun battle ensued as diners 
ducked for cover. The officers were killed within a few minutes and Twining and 
Davis escaped. 
</P>
<P>
 Twining broke into a home near the Newhall CHP station and briefly took a man 
inside hostage, but committed suicide when officers stormed the house using 
tear gas. Davis stole a camper and tried to flee to the Antelope Valley on San 
Francisquito Canyon Road, but sheriff's deputies captured him. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis is serving a life sentence on a murder conviction at the state prison in 
Corcoran. 
</P>
<P>
 The killings changed the way CHP and many other law enforcement agencies 
conduct felony traffic stops, said CHP Officer Tom Dailey, who was on duty the 
morning of the shootings. He was called in to work at 2 a.m. and directed 
traffic away from the house where Twining had barricaded himself. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the problems on this incident was both officers approached the vehicle 
at the same time," he said. "That's not the case anymore. A lot of times if 
it's a high-risk suspect, neither of the officers will approach."

 I'm turning 30 in a few weeks, but I've been handling it well. 
</P>
<P>
 I don't have gray hair yet or wrinkles, so I've been rather pleased with 
myself as I near what others seem to consider a landmark of sorts. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, I've been doing so well that I've taken what has to be a unique 
approach for any L.A. woman: I have declared my thirtyness before its 
legitimate time. For months now I have been telling new acquaintances that I am 
30, rather than 29. 
</P>
<P>
 I say this to prove that I'm coping well. 
</P>
<P>
 Then I heard somewhere last week that "Rocky" came out 18 years ago. Eighteen 
years ago. I wanted to cry. 
</P>
<P>
 I called The Times' library for confirmation because I for one could not 
believe that I was old enough to have vivid memories of anything that happened 
in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
 But I do.  
</P>
<P>
 When the first "Rocky" came out, I was 11 years old. It was a pivotal time in 
my life. I had cut off all my hair a year or so earlier -- it was so much 
easier to play football without braids. I had a bra -- which seemed rather 
purposeless. I was in agony over acne. And I wished I weighed 10 pounds less. 
</P>
<P>
 I had confidence, however, that those pubescent body flaws would disappear 
with time, so at age 11 I kept going with my happy childhood. I had a happy 
family and we lived in a scenic Boston neighborhood where I had lots of 
friends. Boys and girls swam in the local pond in summers and played flashlight 
tag at night. We ice skated Friday nights in the winter and went caroling every 
Christmas, returning to my house for hot chocolate and doughnuts. 
</P>
<P>
 As I entered my teens, though, I was constantly concerned about how others saw 
me. I could tell if a boy thought I was pretty or if he thought I wasn't slim 
enough. I could tell if he thought my eyes were beautiful. 
</P>
<P>
 Then at 18, I came up with a plan to be physically perfect by the time I was 
25: I would no longer have acne; I would be effortlessly lean and no matter 
what I did -- skating, skiing, sleeping -- my hair would look great. 
</P>
<P>
 What can I say? Somehow 25 passed and I am not physical perfection. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Impending Thirties has given me the maturity to disregard such 
superficial concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, I saw a photo of "Rocky" taken 18 years ago matched against one of 
Sylvester Stallone today at age 45. He looks just the same. Do you hear me? 
</P>
<P>
 He looks just the same!  
</P>
<P>
 For a time I muttered that over and over. Finally I said it so much that I 
realized within that phrase was my vindication. I mean, it's not like he looks 
better than he did 18 years ago. Just the same. 
</P>
<P>
 I, on the other hand, actually do look better than I did in 1976. No doubt 
about it. OK, so I'll never be a waif. But at least the acne is under control.

 If it weren't for the calendar, I wouldn't know I was getting older. OK, there 
are some reminders: a gray hair, a wrinkle or two around my very nearsighted 
eyes, and, oh yes, the fact that my muscles show me less respect than they did 
when I was 25. (Nine years ago, I ran a 7.5-mile race with bare-bones training. 
If I did that now, I'd be doing a little post-race one-on-one with Ben-Gay.) 
</P>
<P>
 I think I'm reminded more often that I'm 34 by the non-physical. 
</P>
<P>
 Such as, my baby sister is 33. Thirty-three! 
</P>
<P>
 Such as, 14 years ago, I was counting the years toward college graduation. 
Now, I'm counting the years toward retirement. 
</P>
<P>
 Such as, I'm about to mail off a birthday card to a woman I've been friends 
with since we were both 7. Is it really possible I've been alive long enough to 
have known someone 27 years? 
</P>
<P>
 Was it actually half my lifetime ago that I left behind high school, pimples 
(well, maybe that's wishful thinking) and braces? 
</P>
<P>
 And has it been 13 years since I first played blackjack in a casino and not at 
the kitchen table with Dad? 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, the calendar tells me so. But my incredulity stems from the fact that 
most of the time, I don't feel older. I'll concede that at times I might act 
like a teen-ager, but that's probably a whole other story. Pretty soon, I'll be 
twice the age I was when I graduated from college. Gee whiz. (Gee whiz, does 
anyone still use that phrase?) 
</P>
<P>
 So here I am, waiting for those "truisms" about getting older to kick in, 
particularly the one about eating less as you age. Uh-huh. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, I can still pack it away in amounts that would make George 
Foreman proud. 
</P>
<P>
 And just as unfortunate is my amazing talent for sometimes evading exercise. 
It's too hot. It's too cold. I'm too tired. I'm too hungry. I'm too full. 
Today's a day with a Y in it. 
</P>
<P>
 When I was younger, I just did it. Laced up the running shoes and took off 
because it was good for me. I even ran in heavy-duty rain. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, I need a little more incentive. Even JFK Jr. waiting back at my doorstep 
with a bottle of Gatorade and two glasses doesn't seem to be enough. 
</P>
<P>
 Gee whiz, I must be losing it.

<P>
 On the sultry summer morning I turned 40, a package arrived from my mother. 
Inside was a book sporting a cover photo of a beatific woman in her 40s. Within 
its pages was her account -- and those of many others -- about entering life's 
prime time. 
</P>
<P>
 These serene and satisfied women -- wearing crow's-feet merit badges -- told 
tales of doubts resolved, identities jelled, childish expectations altered. A 
"rite of passage" they called this day. A chance to transform one's life and 
rewrite stale scripts. 
</P>
<P>
 I wanted to believe them, but all I could think about was my impending divorce 
and stalled career; the fact that the only mammal keeping me company on this 
birthday was my wolf-dog, Baby; that my seemingly once-full life had become a 
hermit's monastery; that now I was supposedly too old to wear my cut-off jeans. 
</P>
<P>
 What was ahead besides yearly mammograms, menopause and toothless mastication? 
 
</P>
<P>
 So I put down the book and cried, a self-pity fest that lasted until 10 that 
night when I took the dog down to Big Corona beach and watched the waves rock 
and roll. 
</P>
<P>
 By then it was quite clear -- even to me -- that my emotions hadn't caught up 
with my age. Inside that 40-year-old body was, indeed, a screaming 16-year-old. 
I started to laugh at myself and melodramatically vowed to change. 
</P>
<P>
 The days of compromise were over. There was no more time to waste. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus began my 40th decade. Now two months shy of two years later, I'm amazed 
at all that's happened: The divorce became final, the career shifted and I left 
my comfortable home of 17 years to try living in New York City, where with a 
child and a wolf-dog depending only on you and you depending only on yourself, 
you have to grow up fast or give up. 
</P>
<P>
 But growing up is hard to do, and despite any outward differences, inside I 
still too often feel 16. I still can't quite believe I'm really not. I'm 
shocked every time I look in the mirror and see the lines snaking around my 
eyes and upper lip, every time I shell out $120 to the hairdresser to cover 
budding gray, every time some man I'd like to date calls me "Ma'am." 
</P>
<P>
 Today I laugh at myself more readily, and that's the beauty of being almost 
42: You become more self-accepting. In your 40s, there's no more easy 
pretending that tomorrow you'll automatically be different. When you feel 
uncomfortable, you stop dead in your tracks and say: "Whoa, what's going on 
here?" 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of acting like a know-it-all, instead of defending and denying your 
own insanity or blaming it all on others, you learn that you really don't know 
much except that you're responsible for your own feelings and that defense and 
denial only postpone any chance of change. You learn to say "I'm sorry." You 
learn to at least listen to what your mother has to say. 
</P>
<P>
 And you learn to listen to other people. When you reach your 40s, you become 
interested in surrounding yourself with those who have already put down the 
mantle of pretense, people who know their own truth and aren't afraid to tell 
it, people who won't collude with you that your wrong way is right. You do it 
because you -- like they were -- are exhausted from doing too much, caring too 
much and trying too hard. 
</P>
<P>
 It's in your 40s when you stop waiting for tomorrow and start to find out who 
and what really matters now -- friends, family and enjoying the present moment. 
That's when career concerns pale next to the sight of a neon Maine sunset or 
your child's hot cheek pressing into yours. That's when you begin to let go of 
many of the expectations you had of yourself and everyone else who crosses your 
path. 
</P>
<P>
 And that's when you watch your 20ish and 30ish friends and thank God you'll 
never have to go back. 
</P>
<P>
 I just wish that this 16-going-on-42 mind could be put back into that 
16-year-old body. Maybe then I wouldn't feel so foolish still wearing these 
cut-off jeans.

READING, WRITING AND GROWING; LITERATURE: AN INNOCUOUS STOREFRONT DISGUISES THE 
ARTISTRY OF THE WORLD STAGE ANANSI WRITERS WORKSHOP, WHERE BLACK WRITERS HONE 
THEIR CRAFT AND CRAFT THEIR FUTURES.

 Some call it church. 
</P>
<P>
 In half-light, the low-back chairs pulled close could easily double for pews. 
A blue haze of incense drifts overhead, and just above the pump-thump of a 
string-bass, a wailing brass horn from down the block echoes a ghost of a 
spiritual. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of passing the plate, though, Michael Datcher, the host and 
co-organizer of the World Stage Anansi Writers Workshop, collects crumpled 
dollar bills as participants enter with book bags, notebooks, sketch pads or 
sheets of stained loose-leaf paper. 
</P>
<P>
 Taking seats before the small stage, crammed with a baby grand, a drum kit, a 
microphone, a music stand, the writers -- teachers, students, engineers by day 
-- make final fixes on their work. 
</P>
<P>
 A young man, outfitted in black except for his leather jacket and a string of 
thick earth-tone beads, takes the mike. Opening his red-and-black journal, he 
squints at the audience. "I do want a critique on it because it's my first 
story. And I think it's kinda wack. Ha!" He twists his face, then bolts through 
the prose -- a biblical allegory. Finished, he looks up sheepishly, into the 
silence, a whisper of fear in his eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Feedback!" Datcher shouts. One by one, hands drift heavenward. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't start out tellin' people your story's wack," poet Peter Harris 
slices to the bone. "You ain't even serious about the story. You gotta be 
serious about the story. You need to take it up a level!" 
</P>
<P>
 Datcher hops in: "You need to develop it and believe in it. I know you can 
'cause I know you're a creative brother. . . . Let's bring up another knowledge 
dropper." 
</P>
<P>
 Founded by poet-performance artist Kamau Daaood and maintained by a series of 
dedicated local writers, the World Stage Performance Gallery has played host 
for four years to "creative brothers and sisters" interested in not simply 
honing their craft, but in crafting their future. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were no places in our community for artists to gather," Daaood 
reflects. "I'm out of the Watts Writers Workshop. I'm a poet myself, but I knew 
I really didn't have the time to develop it." He called on friends -- poets 
such as Nafis Nabawi, Akilah Nayo Oliver; entering the fold later was Anthony 
Lyons, and now Datcher. "It was a slow start," Daaood says, "but eventually a 
drop of water will wear a hole through a rock." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If not for Sarah Vaughan's voice undulating in the back space, Datcher's 
ascetic Leimert Park apartment could double as monk quarters. Here, too, the 
same blue haze of incense hovers in the air. 
</P>
<P>
 Against stark white walls rest a couple of chairs and a bookcase littered with 
literature. The room's centerpiece is Datcher's orderly desk, upon which rests 
a glowing laptop. Dressed in mostly black, Datcher, 26, pauses from his work. A 
free-lance writer and graduate student at UCLA, he's seldom far from a pen or a 
keyboard. 
</P>
<P>
 After earning a degree in psychology with a minor in African American studies 
from UC Berkeley, Datcher (who was born in Chicago but grew up in Long Beach) 
says, he set out to find a reasonable facsimile of the Northern California 
literary lifestyle -- round tables, workshops, readings for the grazing -- when 
he returned to L.A. in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was going one night (with) my friend AK. . . . . He lives on 42nd and 
Denker and he's a young brother . . . a straight-up B-boy, a knucklehead . . . 
but a brilliant poet and his work is about his life," says Datcher, leaning 
back in his desk chair. "It's hard and full of ghetto-ese. We went to Congo 
Square (in Santa Monica) one night and . . he's screaming into the microphone, 
this really great poem. And no one clapped for him. It was like, really 
awkward. He was hurt." 
</P>
<P>
 A string of such experiences helped Datcher shape a plan. He wanted to find a 
place where voices such as AK. could sharpen and resonate -- not wither in 
silence. "There were so few black voices who were presenting themselves," 
Datcher says.  
</P>
<P>
 His first attempt was to organize a small workshop out of his apartment on 
Sunday evenings. "I'd break out my salt and pepper shakers, we'd have a little 
food." But it was during a visit in 1992 to Leimert Park's Degnan Boulevard, a 
culturally kinetic, black bohemian enclave, when Datcher stumbled upon the 
World Stage -- a burgeoning artistic enclave disguised behind an innocuous 
storefront -- offering tight sets of straight-ahead jazz as well as a sparsely 
attended but faithful writing collective. 
</P>
<P>
 For Datcher, who was ready to flee L.A., Leimert Park was the much-needed 
hook. He moved his living-room session to the World Stage. "It's like Berkeley 
all over again, but it's just a black context." 
</P>
<P>
 Although nowadays most Wednesday nights are standing-room only -- so full that 
sometimes Daaood creeps onstage, mid-stanza, to switch on the ceiling fan -- 
Nabawi (one of the workshop's early architects) remembers the early months a 
shade differently: "At one time, Anthony and I would sit in there and look at 
the clock on the door: 'Ain't nobody here by 9 o'clock, we're splitting.' But 
we kept doing it." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Persistence, word of mouth and new blood have helped keep the chairs warmed. 
And it was Datcher's enthusiasm and dedication to re-tinker the model that took 
it another level. 
</P>
<P>
 "We knew there was something that we weren't doing," Lyons says. "He brought 
in the idea of featuring people. We've structured the workshop. That was the 
magic. He was the third element -- the magic we were missing." 
</P>
<P>
 Datcher's grand vision was to re-fashion the free-styling approach and create 
-- albeit loosely -- some semblance of structure. There would be a traditional 
workshop, a featured reader and an open reading. "It was really just a place to 
come and read your poetry," Datcher says, "and the work didn't really have a 
chance to grow." 
</P>
<P>
 Poets, novelists, screenwriters, essayists and playwrights take the mike and 
face a crowd who, Datcher admits, can get as acerbic and irreverent as the 
infamous audience at the venerable Apollo Theater. Although there are 
guidelines, Datcher says, "Some people literally get talked off the stage. It 
gets hot in there." 
</P>
<P>
 The idea is to sharpen the voice and harden the shell, but not gratuitously. 
Says Datcher: "One of the goals is to share information -- to expand the 
writing community as well as to produce writers who are going to be important 
voices (not only) in black America, but in America in general." 
</P>
<P>
 Daaood admits to feeling an edge of wariness at first. "At that time, I didn't 
have a lot of hope for younger writers, because of the shallowness of the work. 
But in Michael I saw this new breed of writer that gave me hope again. I 
especially see it in the women, who go in very deeply and bring out the 
jewels." 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the inner growth comes from the nurturing posture the organizers 
assume when leading discussion. And it doesn't stop Wednesday night after the 
notebooks are put away.  
</P>
<P>
 "We've had some young brothers here who've come in and their work is . . . 
young, but we do see potential in them," Datcher says. "We try to hang out with 
them socially. We play ball together. There's a guy . . . he just turned 20 and 
his work is just amazing. He came by, we played basketball for two hours . . . 
came back here, wrote some poetry . . . then he went home. He's going to come 
by next week and we're gonna do the same thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Nabawi, too, finds more and more young people writing poetry. " Not rap," he 
clarifies. "People used to bag on poetry. If you read it, you were just an 
egghead." 
</P>
<P>
 The collective's intention ultimately "is not only to be a safe haven," Lyons 
says, "but to cater to the whole writer. Not only sharing the work but sharing 
how to get the work through." 
</P>
<P>
 In that effort, still on the sketch pad are workshop-hosted Sunday 
performances and book signings. Daaood has plans for a spoken-word record label 
and perhaps a quarterly journal. And Nabawi wants to build a choir of new 
voices that would include the public school system and other community 
workshops. "I don't want it to be all black or all white," he says. "I want to 
see an American version of literature -- a full range." 
</P>
<P>
 Emboldened by the vivid scope -- homeless people and college students, 
"hard-core, knuckle-headed brothers reading love poetry, the whole nine" -- 
Datcher himself is often floored by the range. "Black people are far from being 
a monolith. . . . It's just a wild vibe. One of the goals of the workshop is to 
create a dialogue among the disparate groups in the African American 
community." 
</P>
<P>
 Through it all, Datcher says, "I've really just fallen in love with black 
people and the complexity of people's lives. These are just working people . . 
. just everyday people who live in the neighborhood who write poetry. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "The black L.A. voice is definitely a voice of resilience. Much of the work is 
about overcoming struggle or finding beauty in lives that are often difficult 
to find beauty in."

 The onset of "short arms syndrome" is subtle, insidious, irreversible. 
Suddenly the arms are too short to hold a printed page far enough away to bring 
it into focus. 
</P>
<P>
 It hit me nearly 15 years ago -- back when I still rationalized that I was 
canceling 1 1/2 packs of cigarettes a day with a two-mile jog. Walking 18 holes 
of golf was only a warm-up, and spending a full day in the park keeping up with 
my then-4-year-old daughter was . . . well, child's play. 
</P>
<P>
 But someone hit fast forward and it seemed I was buying Christmas presents and 
singing carols every other weekend. Just like that -- 10 years, and that 
romping preschooler was playing JV basketball. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, I had always argued that time is simply a way of organizing experience, 
and Bertrand Russell was younger at 90 than Rush Limbaugh has ever been. 
</P>
<P>
 But the legs have their own reality. 
</P>
<P>
 At my daughter's insistence, I kicked the cigarette habit. But the jogging 
also disappeared, and my waistline became an expanding universe. 
</P>
<P>
 One day I was helping my daughter work on her layup: "Keep your head up when 
you dribble. Concentrate on the backboard. Take off on your left foot from the 
right side, right foot from the left. Release the ball at the top of your 
jump." 
</P>
<P>
 I decided to demonstrate, only to find that my vertical leap had been reduced 
to standing on my toes. 
</P>
<P>
 I made the shot. But any respectable 10-year-old could have swatted it back 
into my face. I silently thought what I have long been fond of saying of 
anything I thought was too physically taxing: "I'm getting too old for this." 
</P>
<P>
 My daughter was polite. She turned her back to snicker. 
</P>
<P>
 I blinked a couple more times, and I was packing her off to college. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after she left, though, the passing years hit with undeniable impact. 
A pickup zipped into a nearby space as I was parking my car. The very 
attractive young woman in coveralls smiled as she got out and moved quickly 
toward me with arms outstretched. I looked over my shoulder, certain she was 
headed toward someone else. 
</P>
<P>
 "My God," I shouted. "It's Noosha." I had known her since she was about 9. I 
had collected her a few times to join my daughter and other youngsters for an 
outing to, say, the Hollywood Bowl. Now she was a senior at UCLA and had moved 
back into the complex where she had lived as a child. If I had been oblivious 
to growing older, Noosha's return disabused me of that fantasy. 
</P>
<P>
 But the reality of my aging was sealed on a rare trip to a music store. "John 
Coltrane?" the teen-ager at the counter asked with no idea whether I was 
referring to a musician or a cheap wine. "OK," I said. "Just show me where the 
albums are." 
</P>
<P>
 Her confusion turned to contempt. With a grand sweep of her arm, she said: 
"You've just been wandering around for the last half-hour in more than 2,000 
square feet of albums." 
</P>
<P>
 "Those are compact discs," I protested. "I don't even own a CD player. I want 
the album albums -- those big, black vinyl discs." 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, those," she said, pointing to a distant alcove. As I started my trek back 
to where Rosemary Clooney and the Four Freshman languished, the clerk asked: 
"By the way, mister, when was the last time you were in a record store?" 
</P>
<P>
 That afternoon I bought a CD player, a new pair of jogging shoes and a year's 
supply of Tiger Balm.

 The trick to turning 60 is never to have believed you were 50. Or at the very 
least, accept Pepys, who believed that the reward of years spent earning the 
estate carried every right to enjoy it. Of course, he was a callow 36 at the 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 In January, I celebrated the passage from quinquagenarian to sexagenarian as 
the eternal man; part silver dignitary, part bounder, all blithe spirit. 
</P>
<P>
 The norm should have been a surprise party attended by wheezing peers 
shuffling down memory lane and complaining about fading systems, replacement 
body parts and geezerhood. 
</P>
<P>
 But I chose to borrow a scarlet Ferrari Testarossa and reeled in all comers 
while heading rapidly south on the 405 for a champagne-and-lobster weekend for 
two at the Hotel Del Coronado. One night was spent mano a mano , Watney's upon 
Burgermeister, with my son, the firefighter. It was a draw. 
</P>
<P>
 Since escaping my teens -- a monumental trauma when a young man's face, act 
and soul are expected to clear up at the same time -- I've known that turning 
three score need not be some malady. 
</P>
<P>
 The moment might be inescapable, but perception and reception can be set like 
a thermostat. Rush at age and it will overtake you. By not wondering how you 
got there, or where you are, chances are you'll forget you've arrived. 
</P>
<P>
 Satchel Paige pitched a full nine innings every day for 29 days when he was in 
his late 30s. We presumed he was in his late 30s because Paige never told 
anyone how old he was. He went to that bullpen in the sky sometime in his 80s 
after speaking a wonderful truth: "How old would you be if you didn't know how 
old you was?" 
</P>
<P>
 Among my rules for becoming 60 without being 60: 
</P>
<P>
 * I will not give up my motorcycle. Nor will I stop driving fast cars around 
racetracks because I'm sure my lap times are quicker than Paul Newman's, who is 
nine years in front of me. 
</P>
<P>
 * I will not measure life by achievements realized or failed. When Mozart was 
my age, he had been dead for 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
 * I will accept that time changes triceps and hair lines. I do not accept that 
it erodes breeding, intelligence, tenderness, dignity, pride, loving and 
understanding. 
</P>
<P>
 * I will no longer envy Michael Jordan, Jerry Brown, Bjorn Borg, Prince 
Charles, Sinead O'Connor or Mark Spitz. But if I had it to do all over again, I 
wouldn't mind being Clint Eastwood. 
</P>
<P>
 * I will stop saying: "If I had it to do all over again." 
</P>
<P>
 * I will play tennis and only singles until an orthopedic specialist, 
dermatologist, neurologist or cardiologist says I must quit. Then I will sign 
up for doubles. 
</P>
<P>
 * I will continue to occupy window seats alongside emergency exits. In the 
unlikely event of a ditching, who would you rather have heaving you through a 
smoking doorway? Me or Macaulay Culkin? 
</P>
<P>
 * I will always keep a place at my table and a beer on the shelf for people 
who say: "You? 60? Get outta Dodge." 
</P>
<P>
 * I will no longer make fun of my wife for covertly enrolling me in the 
American Assn. of Retired Persons. I resented the implication -- until I got $3 
off a matinee ticket to "Schindler's List." 
</P>
<P>
 * And every time I think I have sage, experienced, vital criticism to offer, I 
will pause and remember Andy Rooney's curmudgeonly eulogy to Kurt Cobain. 
</P>
<P>
 So there is a definite upside to this soiree. One gets to make old people 
jokes without being accused of ageism. There are invitations to speak at senior 
professional affairs when at 52 nobody really gave a damn what I thought. 
</P>
<P>
 I play wise old owl to interns and yarn with these journalistic catechumen 
about spikes, copy pencils, Ben Hecht, Linotypes and the Vietnam War, and how I 
get away with using words like catechumen.  
</P>
<P>
 Above all, there is a signal, all-fronts release to being 60. 
</P>
<P>
 It says you've made it. 
</P>
<P>
 It can also reveal, as George Bernard Shaw should have noted, that age is 
often wasted on the old. 
</P>
<P>
 And GBS lived to 93.

BODY WATCH; Q&A WITH KENNETH COOPER; THE FITNESS DOCTOR IS IN; YOU MAY NOT 
RECOGNIZE THE NAME, BUT YOU'VE GOT TO BE FAMILIAR WITH HIS BABY: AEROBICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Never mind that Dr. Kenneth Cooper has written 11 health and fitness books, 
selling more than 30 million copies in 41 languages. 
</P>
<P>
 Or that he founded the Cooper Aerobics Center and the affiliated Cooper 
Institute for Aerobics Research in Dallas, known worldwide for its exercise 
studies. 
</P>
<P>
 Or that he coined the word aerobics in 1968 when his landmark book, 
"Aerobics," was published. 
</P>
<P>
 Mention his name, and the response is often, "Kenneth who?" 
</P>
<P>
 At 63, the tall and lanky Cooper -- "the father of aerobics" -- is too busy to 
care. While preparing for yet another trip abroad to educate the masses, he 
took a breather to talk about our health habits, his career, the 
disease-fighting potential of antioxidant vitamins and his weakness for sweets. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Question: Although you've been writing health and fitness books since 1968, a 
lot of people, even serious exercisers, don't know your name. Does that 
surprise you? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: No, not really. I would say realistically I'm better known throughout 
the world than in the United States and for one reason: the Cooper test. That 
is a 12-minute (fitness) test which has been picked up by military 
organizations and schools and now it is the official test for soccer players 
throughout the world and for referees. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though I created the word (aerobics) in 1968, it wasn't until 1975 when 
Jane Fonda comes along and starts popularizing aerobics and everybody thinks 
aerobic dancing -- which is only one of 31 aerobic exercises -- is exclusively 
aerobics. 
</P>
<P>
 What we decided to do in the early days . . . was to get such a scientific 
base that no one could argue with our ideas. The (Cooper) Institute is doing 
three things: researching, working with corporations and organizations all over 
the world to help establish fitness and wellness programs for their employees, 
and (conducting) continuing education. We trained over 4,000 people last year. 
The work is just what I want it to be. I couldn't care less about notoriety and 
people knowing my name. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: If you had to give Americans a fitness grade, what would we get today? 
</P>
<P>
 A: C-minus. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: And what did we have five years ago? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Probably a C-plus. Maybe a B-minus. We reached our peak in 1984. We had 59% 
of Americans claiming to be exercising aerobically. Now that realistically is 
probably 25% or 30%. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Where do you see us going? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I think we're beginning to see a resurgence. There was a study (unpublished 
as yet) looking at a road race. They started following people in 1980 and found 
by 1990 only 55% were still running. But of interest, 85% were still 
exercising. 
</P>
<P>
 We're finding people are transitioning to other types of exercise when they 
find they can't run anymore because of musculoskeletal problems or they get 
bored with it. So I think moderation is going to be the key to the future.  
</P>
<P>
 If so, that means if you go out and cover two miles in 30 minutes and do that 
three times a week, you get almost the same benefit as you get from running 
three miles five days a week if your goals are health and longevity.  
</P>
<P>
 Q: What do you run a week, mileage-wise? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Twelve to 15. But let me elaborate. We did a study . . . published (in the 
Journal of the American Medical Assn. in which) we found walking at a 12-minute 
per mile pace is the equivalent of running at a nine-minute per mile pace and 
you have one-tenth the injury problem. So I am running about half the time now. 
I've been doing a lot of aerobic walking, two or three miles at a time. I'll 
probably average 3 1/2 days a week running, 2 1/2 days of aerobic walking. 
</P>
<P>
 I get home, have a light evening meal and then about 10 o'clock take my two 
dogs for a walk. I (also) work out with weights for 20 minutes, two to three 
times a week. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: In light of the recent popcorn study (pointing out the high fat content of 
most movie theater popcorn), what do you eat for snack food? 
</P>
<P>
 A: My wife, Millie, makes air-popped popcorn, and we've been on that for a 
long time. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What's your biggest dietary sin? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Chocolate chip cookies. When I sit on the airplane, riding first-class, and 
you can smell those chocolate chip cookies . . . I have them with skim milk. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: If you could tell couch potatoes one way to get motivated, what would it 
be? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Get a dog. Kind of strange, I know. But Paul Dudley White (the late 
physician to President Dwight D. Eisenhower) once said everyone should take 
their dog for a walk whether they have one or not. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Your 12th book, "Dr. Kenneth H. Cooper's Antioxidant Revolution," is due 
out this fall. Recently, in the New England Journal of Medicine researchers 
found that the antioxidant Vitamin E did not reduce the incidence of lung 
cancer and that beta carotene may raise the risk. What are your thoughts? 
</P>
<P>
 A: (The subjects) had been smoking for 36 years, a pack a day. And they were 
50 to 69 years of age when they entered the study. There's a very good chance 
(that) a lot of those guys already had cancer. The only thing that study shows 
is if you put people on that dose of Vitamin E and beta carotene and they are a 
high risk patient to have lung cancer, it's not going to help them. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What's your personal regimen of antioxidants? 
</P>
<P>
 A: The "antioxidant cocktail" -- 1,000 of Vitamin C, preferably 500 milligrams 
twice a day; 400 International Units of natural Vitamin E and 25,000 units of 
beta carotene. So it takes me four tablets a day. . . . In the book I've 
adjusted it according to weight and sex, age and physical activity -- if you go 
up to 30 miles per week (of running), that's fine, but you need to increase 
antioxidants. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Will you ever stop running? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I doubt it. I want to enjoy life to the fullest right up to the last moment 
and then die suddenly. And I think exercise gives me the best chance for doing 
it.

BOOKS & AUTHORS: COMMITTED TO HELPING YOUNG STUDENTS REWRITE FUTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS McLELLAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When Laguna Niguel author Nancy Taylor Rosenberg began sponsoring a writing 
contest at Willard Intermediate School last year, she couldn't believe the 
caliber of one student's writing. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was so sophisticated, I just couldn't imagine a 12-year-old from this 
middle school in Santa Ana came up with this," said Rosenberg, the best-selling 
author of the legal thrillers "Mitigating Circumstances" and "Interest of 
Justice."  
</P>
<P>
 Rosenberg was so surprised by the sophistication of Andrew Albers' entry, she 
is now embarrassed to say, that she indicated in a letter accompanying the 
boy's honorable mention certificate that she thought he may have copied his 
story about Japanese samurai from another source. 
</P>
<P>
 So this year, the seventh-grader took no chances in having his writing called 
into question: His 30-page, single-spaced entry included a cover letter with 
not only his teacher's signature but those of fellow students verifying that 
the story is indeed all his. 
</P>
<P>
 And this time Rosenberg was even more floored by the quality of Andrew's 
entry, a fact-based story about a Russian man who -- a la "Schindler's List" -- 
saved the lives of Jews during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's brilliant," raves Rosenberg, praising the boy's polished prose, 
vocabulary and grasp of his story, which was written like a novel. "It's 
obvious that what we have is a 12-year-old novelist who one day may be a major 
novelist." 
</P>
<P>
 Andrew, now 13, took the top honor at the contest awards ceremony last week. 
</P>
<P>
 When Rosenberg announced his name -- and those of second- and third-place 
winners Billy Rowley and Nga Ta -- the throng of students seated on the floor 
of the school assembly room burst into loud choruses of cheers and applause. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the sort of recognition usually reserved for victorious athletes, and 
that's the point of the contest: to offer writers as enviable role models and 
to encourage students to write. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's good that we're trying to say that potential scholars or 
potential artists are just as important to society as super athletes are," said 
Rosenberg, 47. 
</P>
<P>
 In a city where the allure -- and threat -- of gangs is all too real, 
Rosenberg, a former police officer and probation officer, says writing is a way 
for young people to vent their feelings and frustrations without resorting to 
violence. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of the kids that are involved in gangs are real talented," she said, 
adding that "writing is a wonderful thing because they can use their 
imagination and release their hostilities."  
</P>
<P>
 Middle school students are being targeted, she said, "because we think they're 
at the age where we think we can reach them. It's not too late, so to speak." 
</P>
<P>
 The goal of the contest is to help teach them communication skills first, 
Rosenberg said, but she has a larger goal in mind. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was growing up I was a little bit different, I think, because I had a 
creative personality. I was a loner and felt I didn't fit in, and I used my 
writing to deal with the frustrations in life even when I was very young," 
Rosenberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm trying to teach these kids who grow up with tremendous frustrations and 
fears that they don't have to resort to violence. I tell them, 'Let's deal with 
those things on paper, and if you don't like your world you can create your own 
world' " on paper.  
</P>
<P>
 The writing contest grew out of an adopt-a-school program at Shir Ha-Ma'alot 
Harbor Reform Temple in Newport Beach.  
</P>
<P>
 Rabbi Bernard King said he proposed the program to his congregation as a way 
to make a "bridge" between Orange County communities such as Newport Beach and 
Santa Ana. As he told the youngsters at the ceremony: "I thought schools are a 
great way for us to get to know each other." 
</P>
<P>
 Rosenberg is one of dozens of temple members who have since gone to the school 
to discuss their professions with the students and to serve as mentors. 
</P>
<P>
 From the start, Rosenberg had one goal: "to reach the children and provide 
some sort of emotional connection so that they can feel that I'm their friend 
-- to be a role model and show that you can succeed if you really work hard."  
</P>
<P>
 As she did last year, Rosenberg kicked off the contest by speaking at an 
assembly in which she told her rags-to-riches story (she recently received a 
multimillion-dollar, multiple book contract) and how, as a child, she she used 
writing to help deal with the emotional trauma of being sexually abused. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's extremely inspiring," said King's wife, Barbara, who teaches at Willard. 
"They get very excited when they know she's coming. Nancy is very real, so when 
she talks to the kids she just puts everything out to them." 
</P>
<P>
 Rosenberg has only one requirement for the contest: that the students write at 
least 1,000 words, enough so "they get the feeling of writing. I tell them they 
can use any kind of language. If I see a bad word I'm not going to faint. I 
tell them I want them to use their own voices." 
</P>
<P>
 The more than 50 youngsters who entered the contest this year ranged from 
those in the gifted student program to those with limited English proficiency. 
</P>
<P>
 Entries ranged from Nga Ta's story of girl who is beaten and raped by her 
boyfriend to Billy Rowley's fictionalized account of a Civil War battle. Other 
entries dealt with abusive family situations, anorexia and gangs. "They tap 
into what they see going around them," Rosenberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to three top winners, who received cash prizes of $100, $50 and 
$25, 12 students received honorable mentions. 
</P>
<P>
 But even those who didn't win were presented with a certificate of 
participation, a long-stemmed carnation and a copy of a six-page letter from 
Rosenberg urging them to be relentless in pursuing their goals and reminding 
them that they are responsible for their futures regardless of their 
environment. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosenberg also encouraged the students at the assembly "to keep (the contest) 
in mind and over the summer do more reading, do more writing, expand the 
stories you submitted this year." 
</P>
<P>
 And there's an added incentive for shooting for the top.  
</P>
<P>
 Rosenberg said she has made a commitment to be their mentor for life. "As long 
as they write, I'm going to help them, advise them, read their work and help 
them get into print and guide their career." 
</P>
<P>
 In Andrew's case, Rosenberg has already shown her editor at Dutton a copy of 
his entry. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was very impressed by what she saw," said Rosenberg, who plans to help 
nurture Andrews' writing and believes that if he works hard at it that by the 
time he's 20 "he could be a respected novelist. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I'm trying to say is I have all these resources to help these kids -- 
agents, publishers -- people that will listen. If I bring them along and get 
them working toward it, I can get them into print. So it's not like they're 
just writing blind, working and working and nothing will ever come of it." 
</P>
<P>
 Barbara King said Rosenberg has given many students hope. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of the students (already) thought that they were writers," she said, 
"but they just weren't sure they were good enough, and she just really inspired 
them. She said, 'You can do it; anybody can write.' She tells them it doesn't 
matter if you have grammatical mistakes; it's strictly, 'Go out there and 
express yourself.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Rosenberg proved to be an inspiration for third-place winner Nga Ta, who 
hadn't done any writing except for classroom assignments before entering the 
contest and winning a second-place award last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before, I used to think I had nothing going for me and nothing to look 
forward to," she said, "but now (the contest) really makes me feel like I'm 
good at something." 
</P>
<P>
 Even Andrew, who says he has been writing since he learned to read and thinks 
becoming a novelist "would be a great idea," was inspired by the contest:  
</P>
<P>
 "I really love it," he said. "I mean, wow, I make some money, get to write: 
two of my favorite things." 
</P>
<P>
 Rosenberg, who often travels around the country promoting her books, said she 
usually finds herself talking more about the writing contest than the books 
she's there to promote. In July, she'll be discussing the writing contest at a 
regional law enforcement conference in Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is where my heart is," she said. "If we can get these mentoring programs 
off the ground, we can make a difference."

UCI IN LINE FOR COVETED CANCER CENTER DESIGNATION; MEDICINE: RECOGNITION BY THE 
NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE WILL BRING PRESTIGE AND FUNDS TO UNIVERSITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The cancer research and treatment program at UC Irvine is on the verge of 
winning a long-coveted National Cancer Institute designation that would make it 
one of the top five centers in Southern California, officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 Being named an NCI "clinical cancer center" could bring the university up to 
$2.4 million over the next three years, while also attracting additional 
grants, top-flight researchers and patients wanting access to cutting-edge 
medicine. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, it is a major step toward the university's ultimate goal of becoming 
a "comprehensive cancer center," a still more prestigious NCI designation held 
by only 27 institutions in the nation, and only two in Southern California: 
research centers at USC and UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is something the university has dreamed about having for at least 15 
years," said Hung Fan, director of the UCI Cancer Research Institute, one 
component of the cancer center. "It recognizes the academic excellence of the 
cancer efforts at UCI." 
</P>
<P>
 Brian Kimes, an associate director at the National Cancer Institute in 
Maryland, said Monday that UCI has been informally advised that it probably 
will receive the first-step recognition by the end of the summer. He said the 
UCI cancer staff demonstrated that it meet rigorous standards for combining 
laboratory research with patient care. 
</P>
<P>
 To achieve the NCI designation, Kimes said, UCI had to show that it developed 
cancer research programs that "cross typical academic barriers and departmental 
barriers." He said that while many hospitals have created "cancer centers" as a 
marketing tool, NCI cancer centers must show they have moved research from the 
laboratory to clinical trials and provided community outreach. 
</P>
<P>
 Kimes said UCI is the only medical center in the nation that is expected to 
obtain the institute's first-stage recognition this year. 
</P>
<P>
 UCI officials say the designation will allow the university to apply for 
special research grants that are available only to NCI-approved cancer centers. 
</P>
<P>
 Kimes said he anticipates that as part of the expected designation, the 
institute will award UCI "slightly less than $800,000" a year for three years. 
He said the money can be used to buttress and coordinate existing research, 
such as helping to pay the salaries of the new center's director and senior 
staff, and for launching new research projects. 
</P>
<P>
 In three years, Kimes said, he expects UCI will apply for the loftier 
designation as an NCI "comprehensive cancer clinic." Before attaining that, he 
said, the center would have to meet additional NCI requirements for providing 
public health information services, community outreach programs and training 
for biomedical researchers and health care professionals. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, there are 53 cancer institutions in the country with some form of NCI 
recognition. Others in Southern California that have achieved the first-step 
designation as clinical cancer centers are the City of Hope and the UC San 
Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Frank L. Meyskens Jr., who was recruited from the University of Arizona 
five years ago to spearhead UCI's drive for NCI recognition, recently received 
a phone call from the institute to alert him that it was pending, university 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Walter Henry, former dean of the UCI College of Medicine, said on Sunday 
that he received a note last week in the mail from Meyskens informing him that 
UCI's application, submitted last June to the NCI, had been accepted. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Meyskens is being highly cautious in his public statements. "It is 
not official until the check comes," Meyskens said, adding that so far he has 
nothing in writing. Kimes acknowledged that NCI's formal notification must come 
from its grant management officials, which he expects by the end of September. 
</P>
<P>
 But already there is plenty of excitement among the 104 researchers and 
physicians who are part of the cancer program. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a very prestigious thing for the community as a whole. It is the only 
NCI-approved cancer center in Orange County," said Hoda Anton-Culver, UCI's 
director of cancer epidemiology intervention. 
</P>
<P>
 "This puts UCI in a great league, which is where we should have been before, 
but we didn't have a leader," said Dr. James Jakowatz, a surgical oncologist at 
UCI, who like others praised Meyskens' role in shaping the cancer center. 
</P>
<P>
 "Meyskens has brought basic scientists and researchers together. He is a 
driven man with a vision," Jakowatz said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meyskens is credited with enabling the UCI cancer program to achieve this 
milestone. His admirers said he hired physicians needed to fill gaps in 
clinical research programs, inspired basic researchers and clinicians to work 
in tandem on studies and helped clinicians compete successfully for a wide 
variety of research grants, especially in the area of cancer prevention and 
control. The push culminated last year with submission of an 800-page 
application to the NCI and a visit by a team of NCI evaluators. Dr. Philip 
DiSaia, deputy director of the clinical cancer center, said, "We heard we got a 
very good score."

VETERANS RECALL SACRIFICE OF SLAIN COMRADES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In the hours before President Clinton arrived Monday on this serene hilltop in 
Normandy, there were, as always, just the old soldiers, the fallen comrades and 
the painful 50-year-old memories of the sands below on Omaha, the bloodiest 
D-day beach of all. 
</P>
<P>
 "I see 9,386 graves, and I can't help but wonder why I'm standing here instead 
of out there," Charles D. Brown, 70, said as he searched the rows of white 
crosses and Stars of David for the name of a fallen friend. 
</P>
<P>
 Sniffing back tears, he continued, "It's just the way it's supposed to be, I 
guess." 
</P>
<P>
 And as the years have passed, the retired Iowa book salesman said, "some days, 
D-day seems like a far-off dream and, other days, well, it just seems like it 
happened yesterday." 
</P>
<P>
 The 50th anniversary of the D-day landing was no time for glorifying the 
victory of Allied forces in World War II. Rather, for tens of thousands of U.S. 
veterans who gathered here, supported by wives and husbands, children and 
grandchildren, it was a day to remember the 37,000 who didn't survive the 
liberation of France. 
</P>
<P>
 For Clinton, two members of his Cabinet and millions of others around the 
world, it was a day to say thanks to the quick and the dead. 
</P>
<P>
 "These men do not feel they should reap the glory just because they survived," 
said Walter Cronkite, former CBS newsman and master of ceremonies here. But, he 
added, "to us, whose liberty and freedom you assured, you indeed are heroes, 
each and every one." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown, who worked in a medic unit that treated the injured at Omaha Beach on 
D-day, observed: "It's true that most of us don't like to talk about it. But 
we're talking here because we want to get the word out, that war is an awful 
thing." 
</P>
<P>
 The day began, as it did 50 years ago, in a cold, blowing mist at 
Pointe-du-Hoc. It was there, a few miles from Omaha Beach, that several hundred 
U.S. Army Rangers scaled a 100-foot cliff, under heavy German fire, fewer than 
half making it uninjured to the summit. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't help but get a little nostalgic," said Robert Battice, 72, from 
Ocala, Fla., one of those who made it to the top. "But I'm not near as 
terrified today as I was then." 
</P>
<P>
 Battice was shot in the head three weeks after his arrival in France. He was 
paralyzed for six months but recovered fully. On Monday, he and his wife, 
Wilma, who have four children, 15 grandchildren and 13 great-grandchildren, 
went to the American Cemetery to find the graves of two young men Battice knew 
who didn't come home. 
</P>
<P>
 "D-day was an experience you wouldn't trade for a million dollars," Battice 
said. "But you wouldn't want to do it again either." 
</P>
<P>
 All across the tiny villages of Normandy, where the American and other Allied 
forces are still hailed as "liberators," the French citizenry has been turning 
out in force to thank the visiting veterans. Some can manage only "thank you" 
in English, but it is enough. 
</P>
<P>
 At a store where Brown stopped, a salesclerk summoned the owner from the back 
of the shop to meet the American veteran. "Thank you for coming to my shop," 
the smiling proprietor said. "And thank you for coming 50 years ago." 
</P>
<P>
 "I tell you, it really got to me," Brown said. "I couldn't even speak. My 
words were just right up here," he said, touching his Adam's apple. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the veterans on hand for the commemorations Monday weren't comfortable 
with Clinton's avoidance of the draft during the Vietnam War. At Clinton's 
first stop, Pointe-du-Hoc, the President praised the Rangers, speaking of "this 
sacred soil," and he took time to shake each of the veterans' hands. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of our guys said he shouldn't have been here," Battice said. "But I 
didn't see anybody refuse to shake his hand." 
</P>
<P>
 Retired U.S. Air Force Col. Raynor Roberts, whose one-seat fighter ran mission 
after mission along the coast on D-day, said the President seemed to be trying 
to overcome his past. "But I've got to admit I'm a little bit hung up on the 
whole thing," Roberts said. "How can he come here and eulogize over my buddies' 
crosses?" 
</P>
<P>
 Others, however, seemed to agree with Joseph Dawson, a highly decorated D-day 
veteran, who introduced Clinton at the American Cemetery by saying, "Only the 
one who holds the highest office in our land can properly express the pride and 
gratitude to the men of D-day." 
</P>
<P>
 And, after the President's speech, many stood to applaud. 
</P>
<P>
 The day, though, was reserved for the veterans. They came in wheelchairs and 
walkers, with canes and on the arms of loved ones. 
</P>
<P>
 The veterans patiently posed for pictures with young U.S. soldiers, 
starry-eyed over the old men's past exploits. And a few, like the old 
paratroopers who staged a D-day commemorative jump the day before, tried to 
relive those exploits. 
</P>
<P>
 Herman Stein, a wiry 73-year-old from New York City, and another Ranger 
comrade climbed the 100-foot cliff at Pointe-du-Hoc. Why did he do it? "He does 
it every year," his wife said. 
</P>
<P>
 "You just stay in shape and you can do it. That's all," said Stein, a retired 
sheet-metal worker who wears a hearing aid. The D-day climb took him three 
minutes; this time, 50 years later, it took seven minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 At the American Cemetery, though, the memories were more somber. Every year, 2 
million people visit the cemetery. Many are escorted to graves of their 
ancestors and their friends. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, before the commemoration ceremony, Brown went looking for 1st Lt. 
Elmer C. Dudolski, an old friend from Iowa. He found Dudolski in Row 23, Grave 
No. 26. Brown paused in silent prayer and then took a photograph. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll be taking it back to his family," Brown said.

U.S. WILL SEEK 2-STEP EMBARGO FOR N. KOREA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The Clinton Administration has decided to press for a two-stage economic 
embargo against North Korea, calling for limited economic sanctions initially, 
followed by a total halt in trade, if Pyongyang does not give inspectors access 
to its nuclear plants. 
</P>
<P>
 The outlines of the draft proposal, hammered out over the weekend in 
consultation with South Korean and Japanese officials, were described Monday to 
diplomats from Britain, France, China and Russia, whose approval is key for any 
action by the U.N. Security Council. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. and foreign officials said the proposal has strong South Korean and 
Japanese backing. South Korean President Kim Young Sam and Japanese Prime 
Minister Tsutomu Hata announced their support Monday for stiff action by the 
United Nations. 
</P>
<P>
 But Administration strategists and diplomats cautioned there is little 
likelihood of any real U.N. moves until next week, at the earliest, after other 
Security Council members have time to study documents and suggest changes. 
</P>
<P>
 The developments came as President Clinton, in Europe for the 50th anniversary 
of D-day, sought to avoid escalating the dispute with Pyongyang, saying there 
"still is time for North Korea to change its course" and avoid imposition of 
sanctions. The United States is "not trying to provoke North Korea" and is only 
asking that country's leaders to "do what they promised to do," Clinton said in 
a television interview. "We want them to become a part of our world." 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S.-South Korean-Japanese draft language came amid a flurry of meetings 
in New York, where diplomats from the three countries met to develop their 
strategy. 
</P>
<P>
 Madeleine Albright, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, met briefly with 
South Korean Foreign Minister Han Sung Joo. Later, Albright conferred with 
envoys of key Security Council member states. Separately, the State Department 
said Peter Tarnoff, undersecretary for political-military affairs, will travel 
to Seoul and Tokyo on Wednesday to discuss political issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Although China has said it is too soon to consider imposing sanctions against 
North Korea, Washington is counting on Beijing to support -- or at least not 
veto -- a compromise proposal, particularly if it involves a two-stage plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Diplomats said the Chinese "did not tip their hand" in discussions with U.S. 
officials Monday but agreed with the "general objectives" of encouraging 
Pyongyang to cooperate fully with international inspectors. 
</P>
<P>
 But senior Chinese military officials quietly met with the North Koreans in 
Beijing in what some Western diplomats speculated may be an attempt by the 
Chinese to prod Pyongyang to go along with the thrust of the allies' demands. 
</P>
<P>
 Both U.S. and foreign officials declined to provide details of the draft plan 
-- particularly on how broad the initial round of sanctions might be. But they 
said it would involve more than the usual routine warning that such resolutions 
often provide. 
</P>
<P>
 The two sides have discussed limiting any initial round of sanctions to 
relatively mild measures in an effort to avoid provoking Pyongyang into 
withdrawing from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. 
</P>
<P>
 Times staff writer Rone Tempest in Beijing contributed to this report.

MORMONS' NEW PRESIDENT ISSUES A CALL FOR HARMONY; RELIGION: HOWARD W. HUNTER, 
86, SUCCEEDS THE LATE EZRA TAFT BENSON. HE ASKS DISAFFECTED TO REJOIN CHURCH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 With a plea to disaffected Mormons to return to the fold, Howard W. Hunter 
assumed the mantle of leadership Monday as the 14th president and prophet of 
the 8.8-million-member Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. 
</P>
<P>
 Believed by the faithful to be God's prophet on earth with the power of divine 
revelation, Hunter was unanimously selected with a ritual laying-on of hands 
during a closed ceremony Sunday in the Mormon Temple by the Council of the 12 
Apostles, the church's highest governing authority. 
</P>
<P>
 Hunter, 86, who practiced law in Los Angeles for 30 years and is the first 
president-prophet to be born in the 20th Century, succeeds Ezra Taft Benson, 
94, who died May 30. Benson was buried here Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Hunter's selection was not unexpected even though he has suffered from serious 
health problems. The church has always conferred the office of president and 
prophet on its most senior apostle. Church presidents serve for life. 
</P>
<P>
 Hunter's tone of reconciliation comes at a time when Mormons have been 
excommunicated for publicly calling for the admission of women to the all-male 
priesthood, and for the right to intellectual freedom in pursuing Mormon 
studies. Two prominent dissidents, including Steve Benson, oldest grandchild of 
Ezra Taft Benson, have called the church's actions an "inquisition" and a 
"purge." 
</P>
<P>
 Writing in the May 22 issue of The Arizona Republic, Steve Benson and his 
wife, Mary Ann, said, "The purge has intimidated many Mormons into silence, who 
fear being expelled from the church. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 But on Monday, Hunter called for harmony in the church, which has 700,000 
members in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 "I pray that we might treat each other with more kindness, more courtesy, more 
humility and patience and forgiveness," Hunter told reporters, reading from a 
prepared statement. "To those who have transgressed or been offended, we say 
come back. To those who are hurt and struggling and afraid, we say let us stand 
with you and dry your tears." 
</P>
<P>
 Hunter also struck an unmistakably orthodox theme. He spoke of the need for 
disciplined living following the commandments of God. Without mentioning any 
specific doctrine, he added, "To those who are confused and assailed by error 
on every side, we say come to the God of all truth and the church of continuing 
revelation. Come back. Stand with us. Carry on. Be believing." 
</P>
<P>
 Don LeFevre, a spokesman for the church, said he believed that Hunter's 
remarks were directed not only to the disaffected, but to encourage faithful, 
active members to continue to follow the church's teachings. 
</P>
<P>
 Elbert Peck, editor and publisher of the independent Mormon magazine Sunstone, 
which has published stories and articles about dissent within the church, said 
Monday that he was encouraged by Hunter's remarks. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very stirred by those words. I think that people in the liberal 
intellectual community, though a small part of the church, would find hope. 
Their particular pain in the last year was that they didn't feel that some 
church leaders dealt with them according to the principles" of kindness and 
courtesy Hunter espoused, Peck said. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the conciliatory tone of Hunter's remarks, church leaders and others 
said they expected no dramatic changes in official church policy. They noted 
that major decisions are made by the Council of the 12 Apostles in association 
with the First Presidency, a three-man office headed by Hunter as 
president-prophet and his two advisers, First Counselor Gordon B. Hinckley and 
Second Counselor Thomas S. Monson, whose reappointments were also announced 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's (Hunter) very consensual," said one church leader who asked to remain 
anonymous. "I don't think we will see any great changes immediately. One of the 
hallmarks of this church is stability in times of transitions." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Mormons see their president and prophet as having direct access to 
God's thoughts, in practice a living Mormon prophet cannot proclaim a new 
doctrine without the approval of the Council of the 12 Apostles. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1978, for example, when the late President and Prophet Spencer W. Kimball 
said that he had had a revelation from God that the church should strike down 
its prohibition against African Americans becoming Mormon priests, several 
months of prayer and deliberations passed before Kimball's advisers and the 
Council of the 12 Apostles concurred. Only then was Kimball's revelation made 
public. 
</P>
<P>
 Also announced Monday was the appointment of church Elder Boyd K. Packer as 
acting president of the Council of the 12 Apostles. It was Packer who 
reportedly told a Mormon conference last year that feminists posed a serious 
threat to the church, along with homosexuals and "so-called intellectuals and 
scholars." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked Hunter's position on women in the priesthood, LeFevre said he could not 
speak for Hunter. But he noted, "Others have been asked and indicated that we 
follow the pattern of the Savior's example. I'd expect that would continue." 
The Mormon view is similar to that of the Roman Catholic Church, which bars 
women from the priesthood, citing the example of Jesus who chose only men as 
his disciples. 
</P>
<P>
 Mormon feminist Maxine Hanks of Salt Lake City, who was excommunicated in 
September, said that while Hunter struck a chord of reconciliation, his main 
point was that believers should rely on the church's authority rather than 
their consciences in making decisions involving church teaching. 
</P>
<P>
 Hanks said she was excommunicated because she published a feminist book, 
"Women and Authority: Re-emerging Mormon Feminism," that called for women to 
exercise more authority in the church and said they should be allowed to serve 
as priests. The church does not comment on excommunications. But it 
acknowledged that seven members have made their excommunications public in the 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "That doesn't sound like much of a purge out of 8.8 million members," said 
LeFevre. 
</P>
<P>
 After a career in Southern California as a corporate attorney and businessman, 
Hunter was named to the Council of the 12 Apostles in October, 1959, and had 
been president of the council since June, 1988. His selection ended speculation 
that the church might face a crisis of succession if Hunter chose not to accept 
the position. 
</P>
<P>
 At Benson's funeral, Hunter required assistance walking. He underwent heart 
surgery in 1986, was afflicted with a nervous disorder in 1987 that makes it 
difficult for him to walk, came down with pneumonia in 1990, and had a gall 
bladder operation last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Hunter replied to a shouted question about his health Monday as aides were 
escorting him from the news conference. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm much improved in strength," he said. "I had a bout with my health, from 
which I'm much improved, and grateful." Profile: Howard W. Hunter

17 ARRESTED IN RAIDS ON ALLEGED BOOKMAKING RING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Southern California's largest illegal sports bookmaking operation was crippled 
Monday when sheriff's deputies swept through five counties and arrested 17 
people, including a man believed to be the leader of the enterprise, which 
netted $5 million a month, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 About 100 deputies fanned out through Los Angeles, Riverside, San Bernardino, 
Ventura and Orange counties and made all of the arrests at about 7 a.m., 
according to the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. Authorities said they 
wanted to stop the ring before the next wave of illegal betting, expected to 
hit when the National Basketball Assn. finals begin Wednesday. One suspect was 
still at large by day's end, however. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was the biggest bookmaking organization for sports betting in Southern 
California," said Lt. David Kading of the Sheriff's Special Investigations 
Bureau vice detail. "Hopefully, we have put them out of business for a short 
period of time, until they bail themselves out." 
</P>
<P>
 Bettors found out about the widespread operation by word of mouth, and it was 
so sophisticated that regular customers used special identification codes, 
authorities said. For those owed money from recently placed bets, authorities 
had this advice: All bets are off. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those arrested Monday were Kale Kalustian, 65, of Granada Hills, the 
alleged head of the ring, and two top aides, Walter Miller, 45, also of Granada 
Hills, and Ron LaForgia, 42, of Thousand Oaks, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Kading said illegal bookmaking is so rampant that authorities hold out 
little hope the operation will remain dormant for long. 
</P>
<P>
 Kalustian and some of his alleged associates had been arrested at least once 
before, in 1986, on suspicion of masterminding a similar, though smaller, ring. 
Authorities allege that this time, Kalustian had taken over at least some of 
the control of a massive illegal operation from a man named Ron Sacco, a 
California-based bookmaker believed to have run the largest sports betting 
scheme in the world until his indictment last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kalustian had been an associate of Sacco for years, and when the Sacco 
organization was somewhat dismantled, Kalustian flowed in and filled the void," 
Kading said. "If (Kalustian) goes to prison along with his top lieutenants, 
someone else will flow in and fill the void. That is the nature of the game." 
</P>
<P>
 All 17 people arrested were booked for investigation of conspiracy to commit 
bookmaking and were being held in lieu of $200,000 bail each. Arraignments had 
not been scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
 The investigation into the current ring began nine months ago and there had 
been more than a dozen arrests prior to Monday. Kading said that the ring 
specialized in taking bets for professional and college basketball and football 
games, as well as betting at major horse racing tracks, and that clerks took 
the bets from a variety of locales and phone numbers in order to thwart 
authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 At least part of the operation was believed to be run by Kalustian out of his 
home in the 12000 block of Bambi Place in Granada Hills, where the alleged 
kingpin was believed to be making "the lion's share" of the profits, Kading 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We knew Kalustian was the head of the biggest organization in Southern 
California and we targeted him," said Kading. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, authorities seized $82,408 in cash from five locations, including 
$34,099 from Kalustian and $29,791 from Miller. Also seized and displayed at a 
news conference Monday afternoon were computers, financial ledgers, cellular 
and regular phones, and tape recorders that allegedly were used to record the 
bets and transactions. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides Kalustian and his alleged lieutenants, the 14 other suspects arrested 
Monday were clerks who were paid between $200 and $300 a week in cash to take 
bets over the phone, authorities said. They were arrested at their homes in 
Quartz Hill, Bellflower, Sherman Oaks, Westlake, Century City, Pico Rivera, Los 
Angeles, Diamond Bar, Ontario, Duarte, Whittier, San Pedro, Rancho Mirage in 
Riverside County and Los Alamitos in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County authorities went along on some of the raids because they too 
have been investigating the alleged ring, Kading said. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities described the raids as a major success, given the elusive nature 
of sports betting operations. Such rings spread their operations over a vast 
region so some associates will have time to escape and destroy evidence even 
while others are being arrested. But in this case, authorities, using a battle 
plan several hundred pages long, coordinated the raids in secrecy and made the 
arrests all at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
 By late afternoon, only suspected clerk Robert Tondreau was still at large, 
and authorities said they had seized $2,000 in cash from his San Pedro home. 
"He'll undoubtedly miss that right away," Kading said. "He'll realize everyone 
got arrested except for him. He may hide, but we know who he is." 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities conceded, however, that they believed others were involved. They 
said they decided to concentrate on 18 key people because of the Sheriff's 
Department vice unit's relatively small staff. 
</P>
<P>
 "The organization is probably larger; they go sideways, they go up, they go 
lateral, they go everywhere," Kading said. "This is probably one of the biggest 
operations the vice detail has ever participated in. " 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the clerks had been arrested before in recent months, but had gone 
right back to work upon release, said Kading. 
</P>
<P>
 Kalustian himself was charged along with 11 others -- including LaForgia -- in 
1986 with running what authorities at the time said was the largest such ring 
in Southern California. That operation took in more than $30 million a year in 
wagers, turning a net annual profit of $4 to $6 million, according to 
authorities. The results of that case were not immediately available because 
the records are not on the Los Angeles County district attorney's office 
computers, a spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Kalustian's current operation was much larger and more sophisticated, 
according to Kading, more similar in scope to the one allegedly run by Sacco. 
</P>
<P>
 Sacco was indicted last August along with 25 suspected aides after a five-year 
federal, state and local investigation. He was charged with running a 
$1-billion-a-year sports bookmaking ring. But a judge in Northern California 
revoked Sacco's bail in recent months after authorities said he had resumed his 
bookmaking. Sacco currently is in federal custody awaiting trial. 
</P>
<P>
 After law enforcement began investigating his operation, authorities believe 
Sacco moved it to the Dominican Republic, where he took calls by running 
toll-free phone lines, authorities said.

6 CITY EMPLOYEES SUSPECTED IN WORKERS' COMP FRAUD; INVESTIGATION: ALLEGED 
$1-MILLION SCHEME INVOLVING THEIR BOSS MAY BE WIDER THAN FIRST THOUGHT, POLICE 
SAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 As many as six employees who help review workers' compensation claims for the 
city of Los Angeles are under investigation, suspected of assisting or 
condoning their supervisor's alleged scheme that bilked taxpayers out of an 
estimated $1 million or more, authorities said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said that the network suspected of creating fake worker injury claims 
may be much more extensive than revealed last week, when they raided the home 
and office of a top administrator in the city's Workers' Compensation Division. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman at the center of the probe, Thelma Bowman, remained on a paid leave 
from her $61,000-a-year post Monday as detectives reviewed records seized from 
her home, her office and eight other locations. 
</P>
<P>
 Interviewed at her Baldwin Hills home Monday morning, Bowman denied any 
wrongdoing and blamed any irregularities on the city's troubled workers' 
compensation system. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not true what the city is saying," said Bowman, standing in her bathrobe 
and peering through a glass door. "The system is all screwed up. When they look 
at it, it will come out. It's all political." 
</P>
<P>
 The criminal probe comes amid scrutiny of the city's procedures for reviewing 
and paying claims by injured workers. A task force last month reported that the 
city could save $32 million if its claims were reduced to the national average. 
And the City Council will soon consider proposals by Mayor Richard Riordan to 
turn administration of some workers' compensation claims over to a private 
firm. 
</P>
<P>
 The immediate criminal probe centers on Bowman, 43, who for six years has 
supervised about 20 employees. Her unit reviews claims for all city employees 
except police officers, firefighters and workers for independent departments 
such as the Department of Water and Power. 
</P>
<P>
 As a principal workers' compensation analyst, Bowman had a "tremendous amount 
of discretion" and her superiors seldom reviewed claims that she approved, said 
Phil Henning, assistant general manager of the Personnel Department. 
</P>
<P>
 But when the Personnel Department began a routine audit of the division 
earlier this year, it uncovered suspicious claims. That prompted a wider 
investigation, which began about a month ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said they now believe that instead of rooting out fraud and false 
claims by city employees, Bowman and as many as six co-workers may have 
defrauded the city themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Police Lt. Ken Welty, who heads the fraud unit of the LAPD's 
bunco-forgery division, said the employees are under suspicion of failing to 
report the activity or helping to fake claims, along with two or three doctors. 
</P>
<P>
 A source familiar with the case said that police believe phony injury claims 
were filed on behalf of workers, some of whom do not exist, and that doctors 
billed the city for phantom office visits. Investigators theorize that the 
doctors would then bill the city and, when they were paid, divide the spoils 
with Bowman, the source said. 
</P>
<P>
 "She got her cut and the doctor got his cut and everyone went about their 
merry way," the source said. 
</P>
<P>
 In simultaneous searches last Thursday, more than 30 detectives and police 
officers raided Bowman's home and the city's Workers' Compensation Division, 
which is housed with most of the Personnel Department several blocks east of 
City Hall. Also searched were at least one doctor's office and several post 
office boxes and businesses, Welty said. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators found $46,000 in cash in a safe in Bowman's home. Also targeted 
in the search were records for more than 100 people, believed to be either 
fictitious employees or doctors and private investigators tied to the scheme. 
</P>
<P>
 Welty said his investigators have just begun to wade through other documents 
and evidence, enough to fill six file drawers. 
</P>
<P>
 He said it could be a month or more before any charges are filed. "This is 
going to stack up as a pretty major fraud when it is all done," Welty said. "It 
involves a lot of money and a lot of conspirators." 
</P>
<P>
 Bowman has not been arrested. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said they will be looking for evidence of how she might have spent 
any ill-gotten gains. 
</P>
<P>
 Bowman, who worked her way up from clerk-typist to supervisor, was known among 
her co-workers as a stylish dresser who wore designer suits and striking 
jewelry. Some colleagues wondered how she had afforded her two-story, $350,000 
Baldwin Hills home. 
</P>
<P>
 Bowman's attorney, Howard Greenberg, said his client does not have a lavish 
lifestyle. He said Bowman's neighborhood is "not Beverly Hills or Woodland 
Hills" and that she owns two modest cars, a 1986 Buick and a 1983 BMW. He added 
that the cash found in her safe "does not mean she took anything." 
</P>
<P>
 Greenberg portrayed Bowman as a loyal employee with an exemplary work record 
who is being blamed for errors that really resulted from the general chaos in 
the city's Workers' Compensation Division. 
</P>
<P>
 Several observers at City Hall predicted that the case will increase momentum 
for reform of the city's workers' compensation process. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Richard Riordan and City Atty. James K. Hahn last year appointed a task 
force of attorneys, accountants, insurers and consultants to study the workers' 
compensation system. After months of review, the experts found that: 
</P>
<P>
 * The city receives nearly 27 claims per 100 workers, compared to a national 
average of just over 15 claims. 
</P>
<P>
 * The city pays $2,169 per employee for workers' compensation, compared to 
$830 nationally. 
</P>
<P>
 * Many municipal employees can make more when they are out on disability than 
when they come to work. 
</P>
<P>
 * Workers' comp claims adjusters who are supposed to stem the tide are grossly 
overburdened. They handle an average of 1,700 cases each, compared to the 
industry standard caseload of 250 workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Personnel Department officials have not even complied with a 1990 request of 
the city controller's office that they issue a manual to tell claims adjusters 
how they should do their job. The department is too overburdened to complete 
the task, said Ray Allen, assistant general manager of the Personnel 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
 He said that many of the problems in the Workers' Compensation Division are 
the result of the shortage of employees. He said the City Council has 
considered, and rejected, several requests for more claims adjusters. 
</P>
<P>
 Bowman's lawyer indicated that the problems in the department will become part 
of her defense. 
</P>
<P>
 Greenberg denied that she created any ghost employees, saying that she was a 
supervisor and that others in the department created new case files. 
</P>
<P>
 There was a huge backlog of paperwork and not much time for verification, he 
said. Mistakes may have been made in the rush to complete the job, but that 
does not mean that anyone had criminal intent, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "She worked for the city for 24 years and has been a loyal employee," he said.

COLUMN ONE; STARTING LIFE ON A CHURCH DOORSTEP; IN THE TWO MONTHS SINCE HE WAS 
ABANDONED, BABY BOY DOE'S CONVOLUTED JOURNEY HAS PUT HIM ON 'FAST TRACK' TO 
ADOPTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It was cold and dark when Pastor C. W. Van Gilder got up, as usual, at 5:15 to 
let out his dog Fergie. Suddenly, he heard Fergie bark. The sound was sharp, 
like a warning. 
</P>
<P>
 There had been break-ins at Van Gilder's church next door, the First Baptist 
in Signal Hill, and he figured he should investigate. 
</P>
<P>
 As he rounded the corner from his apartment, he could make out a black bag on 
the church stoop. 
</P>
<P>
 "I turned the porch light on, opened up the bag and said, 'My goodness, Fergie 
. . . we found a baby.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Only an hour or so after the infant's birth, someone had wrapped him in a 
beach towel, put him in an oversized vinyl bag smelling of tobacco and left him 
squirming there, as silent as hope. 
</P>
<P>
 The baby, discovered April 7, was one of a dozen or so newborns abandoned each 
year in Los Angeles County by mothers who officials say are young, alone and 
driven by fear or emotional instability. They leave their babies in dumpsters, 
in public restrooms or by the sides of roads. Some walk away from them in 
stores or hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
 Possessing neither names nor known family, the babies present a puzzle for 
doctors and police, and a challenge for judges and social workers. If they 
survive, they sometimes become a surprise for relatives who are found and 
persuaded to take them in; occasionally, they are a prize for couples who have 
been waiting on official lists for years for a child to adopt. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, two months after his discovery, the Signal Hill baby is on the road to 
adoption himself, having passed through numerous pairs of hands in an odyssey 
of mystery, danger, celebrity and bureaucratic confusion. 
</P>
<P>
 Along the way, nearly everyone has given him a name -- Kevin, Jim, Shawn 
Patrick. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials call him Baby Boy Doe. THE HOSPITAL 
</P>
<P>
 It took only a few minutes for a Signal Hill police officer to respond to a 
911 call from Van Gilder and race the baby to Long Beach Memorial Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 About 5:30 a.m., toward the end of her shift, Val Lancer, the night charge 
nurse, took the black bag from the officer, who told her it contained a baby. 
</P>
<P>
 "Is it dead?" she asked. She looked in. The baby was quiet, it was not moving 
and it was cold. "It had what looked like blond, reddish hair. It was wrapped 
in towels that were damp, very damp," she said later. He was not crying, which 
indicated to her that he might be in trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 "I picked that baby up and ran with it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the emergency room, a team of workers administered oxygen, cleaned 
potentially harmful fecal matter from him and wrapped him in blankets. To 
stimulate him, they flicked his feet and pushed him around on a gurney. 
Finally, on his own, he began to cry. 
</P>
<P>
 For a newborn left untended, outside, on a cold night, his condition was 
surprisingly good. He weighed a small but satisfactory six pounds and measured 
19 inches. A drug test was negative. He was not tested for HIV or for alcohol, 
which is more common than drugs, but harder to detect. 
</P>
<P>
 Whoever delivered the baby had somehow cut and sufficiently cauterized the 
umbilical cord to stop the bleeding. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whatever they did, he looked great. He was a beautiful baby," recalled Dr. 
Gail Carruthers, the night emergency room physician. "He was perfect." 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the nurses started to call him Kevin. But, someone suggested, "Let's 
call him Jim, he came in a gym bag." THE POLICE 
</P>
<P>
 Abandoning a baby is a felony. "If the baby died, homicide would be working 
it," said Police Sgt. Daniel W. Cravens, who is in charge of efforts to locate 
the mother. At the time of night when the child was left at the church, his 
temperature could have dropped dangerously low or he could have been killed by 
a stray dog. 
</P>
<P>
 This was only the second such case that Cravens had seen in 22 years in Signal 
Hill, a 2.3-square-mile city with 8,200 people. 
</P>
<P>
 He urgently wanted to find the mother, as much to obtain medical information 
for adoptive parents as for prosecution. Also, to pave the way for adoption, 
parents' rights must be legally terminated, and the law requires a diligent 
search before this can happen. 
</P>
<P>
 The effort to find the mother started that morning with a news release faxed 
to 17 television stations and newspapers. Officers called a news conference in 
the afternoon, where the baby and the black bag were photographed and 
displayed. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the baby was drug-free, Cravens figured the mother was probably not a 
prostitute. "It's absolutely healthy. It looks like the mother took care of 
herself," he said. He also suspected she was young. "A teen-ager is not taking 
the time to think things out clearly, and goes to the cliche mode seen in 
movies -- leave the baby on the church steps." 
</P>
<P>
 Also, he said, an older woman might have had the "common horse sense" to 
deliver her baby at a hospital, or leave him in an emergency room where he 
would be found within minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 He believed the pregnancy had been hidden by someone who had no one to confide 
in. The church was not easy to find and he suspected the mother might be a 
member of the congregation. 
</P>
<P>
 Within days, investigators would talk with two women suggested by Pastor Van 
Gilder. One, it turned out, was still pregnant; the other had never been. They 
called the local continuation high school. Nothing. They also investigated a 
tip about a pregnant woman named Lee reported panhandling at Ralphs, and even 
walked the railroad tracks, looking for transients. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody even saw the mother," he said. "If we don't get (her) in 24 hours or 
48, it gets real rough." 
</P>
<P>
 The first evening, several stations ran the story. 
</P>
<P>
 The calls started coming at 10 p.m., the first from a man who thought the baby 
might be his. But officials ruled him out after checking him out. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the callers wanted to know if they could adopt the baby. 
</P>
<P>
 Social workers say people who find or see an abandoned baby on TV often 
consider it a sign that the baby was meant to be theirs. The answer is always 
no. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason, officials say, is that there are official priorities, protocol and 
procedures, notably a diligent search to find the parents and verify that they 
are indeed not interested in their child, and terminate their rights. Moreover, 
for every baby that a mother rejects, there are thousands of people in the 
county who have been screened and have been waiting for years to adopt. For a 
healthy white infant, that list is long. 
</P>
<P>
 After a night in the hospital, Baby Boy Doe was transferred to a foster home. 
But he would stay only a week. THE MIX-UP 
</P>
<P>
 He was given to foster parents in Orange County. They felt as if they had won 
the lottery after receiving the call from officials. "We thought it was a 
mini-miracle," said the father, who asked that his name not be used. He said 
the baby was healthy, looked Irish, like himself, and could have passed for a 
brother to the boy they were in the process of adopting. They already had a 
furnished nursery and had borrowed infant clothes and a swing. They called him 
Shawn Patrick. 
</P>
<P>
 But a week later, Los Angeles County Department of Children's Services workers 
removed the infant, telling the parents only that they were acting on "orders 
from above." 
</P>
<P>
 "It was an honest mistake on my part," said Mark Jadeed, an emergency social 
worker with the agency. He had placed the child with the couple through a 
private foster care agency, rather than a county-approved home. "We don't have 
too many cases whereby a child is left like this," he said. "So I was hazy on 
the procedure. I should have gone back and read the policies. Apparently, I 
didn't." 
</P>
<P>
 Under the policies, abandoned babies can be put on a "fast track" toward a 
permanent home within days, with a judge's approval. In those cases, babies can 
be placed in potentially permanent "fost-adopt" homes with pre-screened 
parents, and adoption papers can be formalized in six months if relatives are 
not found, or are uninterested. Otherwise, the child must stay with a foster 
family for up to 18 months while the search continues. 
</P>
<P>
 "They didn't fast-track the baby and (the Orange County woman) was apparently 
interested in adoption at the outset and it looked like I set it up this way," 
Jadeed said. He didn't make any deals with the family, but he said, "It could 
be interpreted that way." 
</P>
<P>
 The potential to abuse the system with a human form of insider trading always 
exists, said Rex White, a children's services regional administrator and one of 
those who ordered the baby's removal. But he added, "The system does work, even 
when mistakes are made." In his opinion, he said, "It was an honest mistake 
based on enthusiasm. It had nothing to do with the quality or stability of the 
initial home." 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County foster father recalled, "They came on Friday and took Shawn. 
They called at 5:30 p.m., came at 7 at night. It was devastating to us to watch 
our little boy cry and say, 'Don't take him.' Just earth shattering. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a surprising move to a lot of people. But the explanation was that he 
should never have been in our house to begin with. How can you argue with 
that?" HIS NEXT HOME 
</P>
<P>
 "Here's Andrew," the new foster mother said a few weeks later, cradling the 
infant, who was bundled in a Mickey Mouse sleep suit and sucking on a bottle of 
formula. His skin was translucent, his head a fuzzy peach. 
</P>
<P>
 "At first I thought he had a Bob Hope nose, but now I think it's a Richard 
Nixon nose," the mother said. 
</P>
<P>
 Her modest home, filled with cribs, toys, blankets and bottles, had sheltered 
her own two children, now grown, as well as four foster children she and her 
husband have adopted, and a fifth they are in the process of adopting. 
</P>
<P>
 She asked that neither her name nor community be used to protect their 
privacy. 
</P>
<P>
 The doctor she consulted told her that Andrew is developing normally, although 
at first when he stretched, his arms and legs quivered uncontrollably. He has 
gained a pound a week and is getting longer. He's not shy about letting his 
keepers know when he wants a clean diaper or to be held, and had kept her up 
all the previous night. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon, he was gurgling, and sucking on two of his own fingers to calm himself. 
His eyes closed and his face began to assume the various expressions of private 
baby dreams. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes, she said, he smiles into thin air. "Not at you. But he will smile. 
He looks around." 
</P>
<P>
 One of her children who was also abandoned as an infant has taken to the new 
baby "like a duck to water," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The foster mother, now a grandmother, remembers when foster parents could 
choose whether to adopt the babies they care for. "My friend adopted a girl she 
found in a grocery store," she said. "Now they've changed the rules. (The 
babies) automatically are going to go into adoptions and we don't get a say 
unless they become unadoptable -- chronically ill and nobody will take them," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are so many children in the system waiting, getting older by the day. 
It's not their fault if they aren't the perfect little child that everyone 
wanted. They're lined up to get this one," she said of Andrew. "What about the 
others?" THE FUTURE 
</P>
<P>
 Ed Windsor, a program specialist for Children's Services, said it is rare when 
no one comes forward to claim an abandoned baby or identify the mother. 
"Ninety-eight per cent of the time, we can identify someone. The number who 
proceed through the system and remain abandoned until they are adopted is 
almost nonexistent." 
</P>
<P>
 By May 25, no one had come forward and a judge ordered "fast-track" adoption 
proceedings for Baby Boy Doe, anonymous sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 As a last resort, a notice will be published in the Los Angeles Daily Journal 
legal newspaper seeking information about the baby's parents. If a parent 
surfaces, blood and genetic testing will be done. 
</P>
<P>
 The mother could receive probation instead of jail time, depending on her 
circumstances. The county could also provide her with counseling in an attempt 
to reunite the biological family. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not every parent who abandons a child is psychotic or totally dysfunctional," 
said Evelyn Syvertsen, deputy regional administrator for the Van Nuys 
children's services office. "Some people just feel totally helpless. They have 
themselves in some sort of circumstance and see no way out. In those instances, 
they're doing this in the best interest of the child." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Baby Boy Doe will stay where he is, or be placed with "fost-adopt" 
parents who could become his permanent parents. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosemarie Kriesel, a county social worker and adoptions liaison, has already 
started a "what-if" search, generating a list of possible families from parents 
who indicated a willingness to take a child with an unknown background. 
</P>
<P>
 She started with families who had been waiting the longest and those with 
matching racial-ethnic background. In this case, she also sought people who 
said they would be willing to get therapy if Baby Boy Doe starts questioning 
his identity. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's going to have a lot of feelings about his abandonment," Kriesel said. 
"They have to be able to deal with this issue." 
</P>
<P>
 She encourages adoptive parents to tell the truth, as early as possible, and 
to be as positive as they can. "In his case, he can be told that his mom left 
him in a place where she knew someone would find him. She left him at a church. 
She could be young, overwhelmed, feeling like she wanted a better life for him. 
That if she left him at church, he would be safe and go to a loving family." 
</P>
<P>
 Even children left to die in dumpsters can be told: "You were found and saved 
and we're so happy we have you now." 
</P>
<P>
 One parent who adopted a dumpster baby said years later: "We pointed out that 
God was watching and he knew when he was going to be thrown in the trash can 
and had a man hear him cry and pull him out before he died. He knows that he 
was miraculously saved from anything bad happening to him, and he's accepted 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 Unless his mother comes forward to claim him, Baby Boy Doe -- once abandoned, 
now ardently desired -- will be in a permanent, adoptive home by Thanksgiving. 
</P>
<P>
 Either way, he will at last have his very own name.

'THEY GAVE US OUR WORLD,' CLINTON SAYS OF D-DAY GIS; EUROPE: HE SPEAKS AT U.S. 
CEMETERY IN NORMANDY ON 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF LANDINGS. BUT VETERANS ARE TRUE 
STARS OF TABLEAU; HE ASKS THEM TO STAND AND HE APPLAUDS THEM.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Standing alone in the fearful symmetry of a seaside cemetery above Omaha 
Beach, President Clinton tried with the power of mere words to repay a debt 
incurred in blood. 
</P>
<P>
 In phrases that echoed among the careful rows of 9,386 white marble markers of 
the American Cemetery, Clinton on Monday summoned the spirits of heroes past to 
inspire today's generations to carry on the mission of the men who gave their 
lives here. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were the fathers we never knew, the uncles we never met, the friends who 
never returned, the heroes we can never repay," said Clinton, gazing out on the 
rows of still, green graves. "They gave us our world. And those simple sounds 
of freedom we hear today are their voices speaking to us across the years." 
</P>
<P>
 As the President rose to speak, the skies that had been damp and leaden all 
day suddenly cleared. By the end of his brief address, the impressive tableau 
above the beach was bathed in slanting sunlight and the warships at anchor 
offshore were sharply outlined against the blue of the sea. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton spoke of the men who came ashore that fateful day, every one a hero. 
Gesturing to the hundreds of D-day veterans in the audience in front of him, 
Clinton said, "Today, many of them are here among us. Oh, they may walk with a 
little less spring in their step and their ranks are growing thinner. But let 
us never forget, when they were young, these men saved the world." 
</P>
<P>
 The President, who was born a year after World War II ended, asked the 
veterans to stand and he applauded them. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday's speech marking the 50th anniversary of the D-day landings that began 
the liberation of Europe was, by far, Clinton's most effective ceremonial 
moment as President. It appeared, at least for the moment, to assuage some of 
the misgivings many in America and overseas have felt about his stature as a 
world leader. 
</P>
<P>
 It has been difficult for the informal, 47-year-old career politician from 
Arkansas to embody the majesty of his office and the authority of commander in 
chief of the most powerful armed forces in the world. His avoidance of the 
draft in the Vietnam War and his evasive explanations for his actions have 
alienated many in the American military. 
</P>
<P>
 This eight-day journey of remembrance to battle sites in Europe was designed 
in some measure to reassure active military and those who served before them 
that Clinton understands their concerns and takes seriously the awesome power 
of his office. 
</P>
<P>
 But more than that, the voyage was a tribute to the millions who served in the 
great crusade half a century ago to free a world from tyranny. While the heads 
of state and government of 11 wartime allies were the appointed spokespersons 
of their nations, the true stars of the show were the veterans, who came by the 
thousands to Normandy this season to remember and to grieve and to cry. 
</P>
<P>
 Kalman Lewis, 69, was a 19-year-old kid from Passaic, N.J., who slogged ashore 
at Utah Beach 50 years ago Monday. He came to bless the graves of friends who 
never returned. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you've been in combat, you always choke up at the cemetery," Lewis said, 
his eyes glistening and his voice cracking. "I hope the kids today never have 
to have a D-day in their lifetimes." Sunrise Memories 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's 11-minute speech at the Normandy cemetery in the village of 
Colleville-sur-Mer capped a day of ceremonies that began before dawn on the 
aircraft carrier George Washington, anchored off the haunted beaches known 50 
years ago as Utah, Omaha, Gold, Juno and Sword. 
</P>
<P>
 On the massive carrier's flight deck in a wet and whipping wind, the President 
led a brief service of remembrance for those lost at sea before they could even 
reach the blood-tinged tide of the invasion beaches. 
</P>
<P>
 A dozen American and Allied warships could barely be seen through the fog as 
Clinton spoke and greeted several D-day veterans brought to the carrier as 
guests of honor. 
</P>
<P>
 "We gather in the calm after sunrise today to remember that fateful morning, 
the pivot point of the war, perhaps the pivot point of the 20th Century," 
Clinton said in remarks that began at 7:21 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 He recalled the tense hours as the massive Allied flotilla sailed toward the 
Normandy shore, how the men passed their time in dice games or silent prayer, 
as their families back home begged the Lord for their safe return. 
</P>
<P>
 "The soldiers who landed on Utah and Omaha needed those prayers, for they 
entered a scene of terrible carnage," Clinton said. "Thousands would never 
return." 
</P>
<P>
 And he recalled the patriotic valor of one unidentified sailor aboard the 
destroyer Corry, which a German mine ripped in half like a child's toy. As the 
ship went down, this sailor saved the flag from the submerging stern and 
scrambled to the main mast, where he raised the flag. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 294 men aboard, 13 were killed and 33 injured. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the Corry's destruction, there was no defeat," Clinton said. "Today, the 
wreckage of that ship lies directly beneath us -- an unseen monument to those 
who helped to win this great war." 
</P>
<P>
 After the speeches concluded, Clinton and four veterans turned and walked a 
few steps to the starboard rail of the looming ship and committed a large green 
and purple wreath to the gray-green waves as a bugler played taps in the unseen 
distance. Deadly Cliffs 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's next event was at Pointe-du-Hoc, the bloodied promontory where 
former President Ronald Reagan put in one of the greatest performances of his 
presidency. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton aides were concerned that he would suffer by comparison. But the 
understated ceremony and Clinton's words there were well received by the Ranger 
battalion veterans who came to listen. 
</P>
<P>
 As a misty rain fell, Clinton strode out to the edge of the cliffs that the 
Rangers scaled at grievous cost in the early hours of the invasion. 
</P>
<P>
 Addressing about 40 Ranger veterans who took the strategic 100-foot-high hill, 
Clinton said: "We look at this terrain and we marvel at your fight. . . . Here 
are the faces for whom you risked your lives. Here are the generations for whom 
you won a war. We are the children of your sacrifice. We are the sons and 
daughters you saved from tyranny's reach." 
</P>
<P>
 He then spoke of the challenge that the younger generations face in building 
upon the veterans' success. 
</P>
<P>
 "Still, there are cliffs to scale. . . . And if we should ever falter, we need 
only remember you at this spot 50 years ago, and you, again, at this spot 
today. The flame of your youth became freedom's lamp, and we see its light 
reflected in your faces still, and in the faces of your children and 
grandchildren." 
</P>
<P>
 The President strode the slippery, cratered ground atop the cliffs with Ken 
Bargmann, a Ranger who survived the deadly climb up the hill on D-day only to 
be taken prisoner the next day. He spent the rest of the war in a POW camp in 
eastern Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton and Bargmann walked with Bargmann's son, Michael, a disabled Vietnam 
veteran, and his grandson, Kyle. "You completed your mission here," Clinton 
told the veterans. "But the mission of freedom goes on; the battle continues. 
The longest day is not yet over." Chilly Utah Beach 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton next traveled by helicopter to Utah Beach for a commemorative event 
hosted by French President Francois Mitterrand. 
</P>
<P>
 The day was growing colder and both leaders were in overcoats before the 
hourlong ceremony ended. It was fairly standard fare -- national anthems, 
military bands, a review of troops. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton gave his briefest speech here, only six minutes long, giving thanks to 
"the thousands of people who gave everything they were, or what they might 
become, so that freedom might live." 
</P>
<P>
 The leaders then went to Caen, an important military objective of Operation 
Overlord, for a luncheon for the heads of state and government of 11 nations 
that were wartime allies -- the United States, France, Britain, Luxembourg, the 
Netherlands, Poland, Norway, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Belgium and Canada. 
</P>
<P>
 The luncheon was held in Caen's Hotel de la Prefecture, a regional government 
building. The city's lampposts were decorated with red, white and blue banners 
commemorating D-day's 50th anniversary. Omaha Beach Emotion 
</P>
<P>
 At Omaha Beach, nine company-sized troop formations representing nations 
involved in the invasion lined up on the sand to greet the dignitaries, who 
included Queen Elizabeth II, who arrived in a royal red helicopter. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton and the other leaders walked among the troops and several dozen 
veterans of the horrific landing at Omaha. The ceremonies included a flyover by 
World War II aircraft and silent reflection at the Monument to the Dead. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point, the queen spoke to ranks of veterans, in formation in the wet 
sand, observing: "I am proud to see so many veterans of Operation Overlord, one 
of the most remarkable amphibious operations ever accomplished. You, and the 
widows of those who fought, will be remembering the deeds that were done that 
day, the comrades and husbands who never returned and those who did come home 
but sadly are no longer with us. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was you and your comrades and allies fighting on other fronts who 
delivered Europe from that yoke of organized barbarism from which the men and 
women of following generations have been mercifully free." 
</P>
<P>
 To the soldiers, many openly choked with emotion, she declared: "Veterans of 
the Normandy campaign, you deserve your nations' thanks! May we, your fellow 
countrymen, be worthy of what you did for us." 
</P>
<P>
 After the events on the beach, Clinton made his way to the American Cemetery 
for the signature event of the day, his address to American D-day veterans and 
homage to those who did not come home. 
</P>
<P>
 He honored not only the Americans who fought and died here but also the 40 
million victims of history's most gruesome conflict. He said the mission for 
his generation and those that follow is "to expand freedom's reach forward; to 
test the full potential of each of our own citizens; to strengthen our 
families, our faith and our communities; to fight indifference and intolerance; 
to keep our nation strong; and to light the lives of those still dwelling in 
the darkness of undemocratic rule." 
</P>
<P>
 In a speech that served for many back home as a history lesson of an event far 
removed in time, and for many in the audience as an emotional remembrance of a 
day that seems so close, Clinton quoted from a letter a young GI, Cpl. Frank 
Elliot, wrote to his wife just before setting sail for Normandy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I miss hamburgers a la Coney Island, American beer a la Duquesne, American 
shows a la Penn Theater, and American girls a la you," Elliot wrote his wife, 
Pauline, and his year-old daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton said that millions of American GIs returned from Europe and the 
Pacific to rebuild America and enjoy the quiet pleasures of peace. 
</P>
<P>
 "But on this field," Clinton said, "there are 9,386 who did not -- 33 pairs of 
brothers; a father and his son; 11 men from tiny Bedford, Virginia; and Cpl. 
Frank Elliot, killed near these bluffs by a German shell on D-day."

ROSTENKOWSKI SUCCESSOR'S PLAN OMITS NEW HEALTH TAX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT A. ROSENBLATT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The new chairman of the pivotal House Ways and Means Committee offered his own 
blueprint Monday for overhauling the nation's health care system, proposing to 
provide universal coverage without imposing broad new tax increases on most 
Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the more expansive reform proposal sent to Congress by President Clinton, 
the plan offered by Rep. Sam Gibbons (D-Fla.) would require all employers to 
contribute to their workers' health insurance, paying at least 80% of the cost 
of the average policy premium. 
</P>
<P>
 But Gibbons' approach is a sharp departure from that of his predecessor, Rep. 
Dan Rostenkowski (D-Ill.), who declared just six weeks ago that the American 
public should be prepared for large tax hikes to finance universal coverage. 
Gibbons became acting chairman of the key committee last week after 
Rostenkowski was indicted on corruption charges. 
</P>
<P>
 His proposal represents an attempt to cobble together a sufficient majority of 
Democrats on the fractious Ways and Means Committee to approve some kind of 
health care reform plan this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Many lawmakers are clearly wary of the Clinton initiative and rival 
congressional plans that call for significant tax increases or that contain 
provisions opposed by small businesses, which have emerged as a potent lobbying 
force in the health care debate. 
</P>
<P>
 The Gibbons plan contains no big tax hikes on individuals. It assumes that 
enough money can be collected from employers who currently do not offer health 
insurance to underwrite the cost of extending coverage to all Americans and 
providing subsidies to small businesses with low-wage workers. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Gibbons plan, the "major thing that is absent is taxes; they are not 
going to be here," said Rep. Pete Stark (D-Hayward), who briefed reporters on 
the contents of the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 (Gibbons was in Normandy for the 50th anniversary of D-day; he was in a 
paratroop division that jumped behind German lines in the pre-dawn hours before 
the Allied invasion.) 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the Gibbons plan offers the promise of significant financial 
relief to states such as California, where Medi-Cal, a jointfederal-state 
program that helps pay the medical bills of poor people, is a growing burden on 
the state budget. 
</P>
<P>
 Under Gibbons' blueprint, states could gradually reduce their spending on such 
programs, starting in 1998. The national Medicaid program for the poor would 
become part of a bigger federal program, called Medicare Part C, for 
individuals who lack private insurance and for small firms that must begin 
providing it. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides eschewing broad increases in individual taxes, the Gibbons proposal 
calls for a smaller cigarette tax hike than requested by Clinton. The President 
wants to raise the federal cigarette tax by 75 cents a pack, and the figure was 
boosted to $1.25 in a bill prepared by a Ways and Means subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
 But Gibbons' plan, called the "chairman's mark" -- the starting point for the 
full committee's debate and action -- would require an increase of 60 cents a 
pack, spread over five years. The federal tax currently is 24 cents a pack; 
Gibbons would increase it to 39 cents next year, 54 cents in 1997, 69 cents in 
1998 and 84 cents in 1999. 
</P>
<P>
 The Gibbons plan also scraps the President's proposal for a 1% payroll tax on 
companies with more than 1,000 workers that choose to opt out of large 
insurance purchasing pools and to continue their current health insurance 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Under his plan, an employer would be required to pay 80% of the average health 
insurance premium, a cost estimated at 80 cents an hour for individuals. 
Companies with fewer than 25 workers and average annual wages of less than 
$26,000 per employee would receive tax credits that would reduce the cost of 
coverage to an estimated 50 cents an hour. 
</P>
<P>
 Firms with more than 50 employees would be forced to buy private health 
insurance for their workers. Smaller companies and individuals could get 
coverage through the new Medicare Part C program. 
</P>
<P>
 Under both the Clinton and Gibbon plans, a two-worker family would decide 
which employer's health plan to use. Even if both signed up under a plan 
offered by one spouse's employer, the company not selected would still be 
required to pay the average premium cost for its workers. 
</P>
<P>
 In such cases, some of the funds collected would be sent to the firm that 
provides coverage for the whole family. But under the Gibbons proposal, most of 
the money would go to the federal government for a five-year period for use in 
the Medicare C pool for the poor and for workers at small firms. This source of 
additional revenue potentially could generate billions of dollars annually, but 
the Ways and Means Committee had no specific estimates. 
</P>
<P>
 Roughly 20 million workers are covered by insurance policies provided by the 
firms where their spouses works. Often, the spouse's employer is a major 
industrial firm with generous benefits, such as General Motors or Xerox. Until 
now, these companies have been hoping that health reform would reduce the 
financial burden they bear to provide insurance for spouses and dependents of 
their employees. They are likely to object to Gibbons' effort to divert most of 
the savings to the government for at least five years. 
</P>
<P>
 After five years, Ways and Means analysts estimate, health care reform would 
generate enough savings to give those companies some financial relief. 
</P>
<P>
 Although health care coverage premiums would be collected from every employer 
by the Internal Revenue Service through a payroll charge called Medicare Part 
C, the Ways and Means staff has carefully avoided referring to those 
collections as taxes. Instead, they are referred to as "retention of a portion 
of non-enrolling employer payments." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to this source of revenue, the apparent need for higher taxes has 
been eased by new financial projections. The Congressional Budget Office has 
increased its estimate of savings from cost containment and reduced its 
estimate of the cost of the mandatory package of benefits, according to Stark. 
</P>
<P>
 All Americans would be covered by 1998 under the Gibbons plan, which calls for 
a standard benefits package that includes: 
</P>
<P>
 * A yearly deductible of $500 for each individual and $750 for each family for 
doctors' charges. 
</P>
<P>
 * Unlimited hospital days with no deductible. 
</P>
<P>
 * Prescription drug coverage after a separate $500 deductible. 
</P>
<P>
 * Checkups and preventive care for children with no deductible. 
</P>
<P>
 Self-employed persons would be allowed to deduct 25% of their insurance 
premiums until 1998 and 100% in future years.

JUDGE SAYS SCHOOLS MUST GIVE CLAS TESTS; EDUCATION: COURT BACKS THE STATE'S 
POSITION. FULLERTON IS ONE OF SIX DISTRICTS THAT HAD REFUSED TO GIVE ITS 
STUDENTS THE CONTROVERSIAL EXAMS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHARON MOESER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Los Angeles Superior Court judge ruled Monday that state law requires school 
districts to administer the controversial CLAS tests, which have been praised 
by some as a revolutionary measure of critical thinking skills and blasted by 
others as intrusive and secretive. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Diane Wayne's decision came after the state sought a court order against 
the Antelope Valley Union High School District. A conservative bloc on the 
district's board had refused to give the California Learning Assessment System 
tests to students. 
</P>
<P>
 "By refusing to administer the test (the board has) clearly violated its 
obligations under the Education Code," Wayne wrote in her four-page decision to 
grant the order. 
</P>
<P>
 Six of the state's 1,006 school districts, including Fullerton, have opted not 
to give the 1994 CLAS tests. 
</P>
<P>
 Antelope Valley is the first district the state has taken to court. 
</P>
<P>
 While agreeing that the law requires a statewide assessment test to be given 
annually, the Antelope Valley critics of the exam had said the Education Code 
does not require it to be the CLAS test, which is being given this year to more 
than 1 million students in fourth, fifth, eighth and 10th grade. 
</P>
<P>
 Billy Pricer, president of the Antelope Valley school board, said he was 
unsure how the district would respond, but noted that an appeal could stall the 
tests until after school ends June 15. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything is resting on how the judge actually words the order and what 
we're ordered to do," Pricer said. "Right now it's a waiting game until we get 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 "Personally, I'd like to see us appeal," said board member Sue Stokka, who 
voted with Pricer and member Tony Welch in the board's April 20 decision to not 
administer CLAS. Monday's ruling "doesn't change my opinion one iota about my 
concerns about the test." 
</P>
<P>
 The CLAS tests have embroiled some Orange County school districts in 
controversy -- and even legal battles. Two weeks ago, Superior Court Judge 
Richard Luesebrink refused to prevent the Placentia-Yorba Linda and Tustin 
Unified school districts from giving the tests to six objecting students, but 
only after the districts agreed to provide a 30-day warning to the complaining 
parents before any future testing. 
</P>
<P>
 In Santa Ana, thousands of students took the exams, but in a protest move, 
school board members voted to withhold the completed test booklets from the 
state. 
</P>
<P>
 Opposition to the CLAS tests has been spearheaded by conservative Christian 
churches and a Virginia group that serves as an advocate for churches. Pricer 
is the former assistant pastor of the Springs of Life Ministries in Lancaster, 
an activist church that is known for distributing a video critical of gay 
lifestyles. 
</P>
<P>
 The Antelope Valley school district argued unsuccessfully that the state 
Department of Education failed to adopt required rules and regulations for the 
administration of CLAS. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are no regulations in the state of California requiring testing at the 
10th-grade level," said Frank J. Fekete, the district's attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 Wayne disagreed, saying such regulations are in place and are sufficient. She 
also rejected the argument that the Antelope Valley position was an issue of 
local control, citing a legal decision that said regulation and operation of 
public schools are statewide functions as outlined in the Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
 State Department of Education officials said they were pleased with Monday's 
ruling. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have now a chance to go forward," said William D. Dawson, acting state 
superintendent of public instruction, who attended the hearing. "My interest is 
primarily in getting on with the job of improving the CLAS tests for the 
future." 
</P>
<P>
 The state Senate last week approved legislation that would reauthorize the 
tests for five more years and would impose several reforms designed to improve 
public confidence in the exams. The measure will next be heard in the Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill by Sen. Gary K. Hart (D-Santa Barbara) would prohibit asking students 
about their sexual, moral and religious beliefs or those of their families. It 
would also create a Legislature-appointed citizens committee to review the 
final test and add parents and other public members to the teams of teachers 
who develop it. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawmakers created the new testing process in response to demands that 
California schools be improved. The performance-based testing -- often 
requiring students to write passages rather than answer multiple-choice 
questions -- is widely hailed in education circles as state of the art. 
</P>
<P>
 Dawson said he was hopeful that in light of Monday's ruling the five other 
school districts that have refused to give the tests, including Acton-Agua 
Dulce Unified, will reverse course.

CALIFORNIA ALBUM; SILLY CIVIC CENTERPIECE CAPTURES A CITY'S HEART; SAN 
FRANCISCO CELEBRATES THE 20TH ANNIVERSARY OF 'BEACH BLANKET BABYLON,' A 
CABARET-STYLE SPOOF OF POP CULTURE, WITH A TOTAL LACK OF SOLEMNITY.

<P>
 It takes a special sort of city to fall in love with a show that features 
absurdly huge pineapple hats, dancing Christmas trees, singing French poodles, 
and a walking, talking Mr. Peanut doll. 
</P>
<P>
 In Des Moines, it might not compute. In San Francisco, the people can't get 
enough. 
</P>
<P>
 We're talking about "Beach Blanket Babylon," a cabaret-style spoof of pop 
culture that has captured the irreverent heart of this city by the bay. Today 
marks the stage show's 20th anniversary, making it the longest-running musical 
revue anywhere -- and a beloved civic centerpiece here. 
</P>
<P>
 Week in, week out, "Beach Blanket" woos capacity crowds with its ultra-campy 
charms. Close to 4 million people have seen it so far, and many are repeat 
visitors. Cyril Magnin, the late department store magnate known as "Mr. San 
Francisco," was the most shameless addict. He went back a record 465 times. 
</P>
<P>
 Like its host city, the show has endured much through the years, including the 
loss of many cast members to AIDS. But it continues to thrive, mostly because 
it has evolved and remained fresh through 7,300 performances. The current story 
line, for instance, includes sendups of the Bobbitts, ice warriors Tonya and 
Nancy, the Clintons and Mrs. Doubtfire. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'Beach Blanket' is not only a lot of fun," says Assembly Speaker Willie 
Brown, a devoted fan, "it's a San Francisco institution. . . . It's right up 
there with the Golden Gate Bridge." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The phenomenon began quite modestly with an outfit called Rent-a-Freak, which 
provided living props -- gorillas on roller-skates, for example -- for private 
soirees. The chief freak was Steve Silver, a native San Franciscan who says the 
only prerequisite was that performers "have absolutely no talent at all." 
</P>
<P>
 One night after supping in North Beach, Silver and 10 fellow freaks came 
across a guitarist raking in the bucks on a street corner. Inspired, the crew 
fetched their costumes and spent the next few hours frolicking on the sidewalk. 
They made $25 the first night, $85 the next. 
</P>
<P>
 "We knew we'd hit it big when the crowd got so deep, people climbed on top of 
a telephone booth to watch us," recalls Silver. "Our goal was to make enough 
money to go south and play Hollywood and Vine." 
</P>
<P>
 They never got to L.A. because Silver, sensing he was onto something, plowed 
his life savings of $800 into a stage show instead. Building on the freak 
concept, he concocted a zany homage to a few of his favorite things: Beach Boys 
music, Carmen Miranda hats and surf movies with Annette Funicello and Frankie 
Avalon. 
</P>
<P>
 The June 7, 1974, debut was staged in the back room of a restaurant. The cast 
numbered 11, including Silver as a dancing M & M, and admission was $2.50 a 
head. The show sold out. 
</P>
<P>
 "The idea was to present a slice of Americana, with a beach-oriented theme," 
Silver says. "We dumped two tons of sand on the floor, and we had a lifeguard 
at the door who sprayed the back of your hand with Coppertone. So, if you went 
out and came back, he had to smell your hand to make sure you paid." 
</P>
<P>
 Silver leased the makeshift theater for six weeks, expecting his offbeat, 
lowbrow production would endure no longer than that. But word spread, and the 
crowds kept coming. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, the show has popped up everywhere from Russian TV to the 1989 
Academy Awards. There was a successful run in Las Vegas, and even an invitation 
to perform at Ronald Reagan's White House. 
</P>
<P>
 While the show has become a popular tourist attraction, 75% of the tickets are 
bought by locals. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you're a San Franciscan, I think you relate to the show in a special way," 
says Karen Bolakian, a sportswear saleswoman who relives the "Beach Blanket" 
experience every year or two. "Occasionally, we take people visiting from out 
of town, but they look at you funny and don't quite get it." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The setting is San Francisco's War Memorial Opera House, where the city's most 
elegant, monied citizens meet and greet over "Tosca" and "La Boheme." On this 
night, however, Pavarotti is not on the program. And the seats in the 
gloriously gilded theater have been populated by grown men and women . . . in 
beachwear. 
</P>
<P>
 One graying gentleman sports a tuxedo top, Bermuda shorts and snorkel gear on 
his head. Another clutches a rainbow-striped beach ball and looks chilly in a 
scanty Speedo and thongs. 
</P>
<P>
 Bruce Gach, in particular, stands out. He has a three-foot-tall fruit basket 
hat strapped to his head. 
</P>
<P>
 "Do you like it?" asks Gach, an earnest, 40-something pediatrician. "I have 
one that's four times this size at home." 
</P>
<P>
 Gach has come, along with 3,175 other giggling people, for the "Beach Blanket 
Babylon" 20th anniversary celebration. Featuring 60 returning alumni performers 
and a melange of favorite skits from the past, the gala event is a visual feast 
-- complete with a finale dominated by a glittering San Francisco skyline hat 
the size of a sailboat. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Gach, most of those attending are "Beach Blanket" devotees, hooked on its 
peculiar blend of kitsch and camp and so-awful-they're-good puns. And what, 
pray tell, is the appeal? Exactly how have spectators as diverse as Queen 
Elizabeth, Ralph Nader and Cheech & Chong been seduced lo these many years? 
</P>
<P>
 "It works," says Gach, a 15-year follower of the show, "because it's people 
poking fun at other people without the risk of getting sued. Everything is 
lighthearted. Innocent." 
</P>
<P>
 Silver, the penniless freak turned famous producer, would not disagree, but 
adds this theory: 
</P>
<P>
 " 'Beach Blanket' is like a health spa, a place where you come, forget your 
problems and don't have to think too much," he says. "It's also a place where 
you're guaranteed to laugh. And with the world in the shape it is today, people 
very much want to laugh."

HOPES RISE FOR TRIBE THAT HAS NO RESERVATION; NATIVE AMERICANS: FEDERAL ACTIONS 
MAY HELP THE TIMBISHA SHOSHONE ESTABLISH A LAND BASE AT DEATH VALLEY. ONLY 40 
TO 60 MEMBERS NOW LIVE IN A BLEAK SETTLEMENT THERE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN FORSTENZER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For decades, the Timbisha Shoshone lived in fear of losing their historic 
homeland here. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the few federally recognized Native American tribes without a land 
base, the Timbisha were moved to a settlement near Furnace Creek in the 
mid-1930s by the National Park Service. They say the park service deliberately 
made life miserable for them, hoping they would move away. 
</P>
<P>
 "They wanted to get rid of us and they thought if they put us here we would 
all pull out, but we're not going to pull out," said tribal council member 
Grace Goad, 66. "This is our home from way back." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the Timbisha are hopeful that their fortunes might soon change. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Senate recently passed an amendment to its version of the California 
Desert Protection Act providing for a one-year study period to identify 
suitable lands for a Timbisha Shoshone reservation. Efforts are under way to 
add a similar amendment to the House version of the bill. 
</P>
<P>
 The Timbisha were also recently awarded a federal grant to be used to begin 
identifying and acquiring a permanent land base and protecting longstanding 
cultural and natural resources. The tribe insists that the reservation be 
inside the borders of Death Valley National Monument. 
</P>
<P>
 Having their own reservation would allow them land for houses and economic 
development and make them eligible for federal grants and programs awarded only 
to tribes with a land base. 
</P>
<P>
 After years of attempting to achieve federal recognition as a tribe, the 
Timbisha -- whose name refers to a reddish rock found in the mountains just 
east of the valley -- finally gained that status in 1983. Their aboriginal 
homeland lies mostly within the proposed boundaries of Death Valley National 
Park as described in the desert bill. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the tribe's 276 members live outside the Death Valley area. Between 40 
and 60 Timbisha people remain here in the 60-acre village, a bleak settlement 
consisting of several adobe houses and a few mobile homes. 
</P>
<P>
 For decades, luxury rooms at the exclusive Furnace Creek Inn resort have 
looked out over the Timbisha village less than two miles away. 
</P>
<P>
 The village lies in the path of sand blowing in from nearby dunes. The sand 
seeps into the houses through door and window openings and even electrical 
outlets, and kills plants and lawns, leaving much of the area barren. 
</P>
<P>
 About a dozen adobe houses were built for the Timbisha decades ago. Plumbing 
and electricity were installed just eight years ago, through a Department of 
Housing and Urban Development grant. Before that, tribe members said, they used 
outhouses, kerosene lamps and wood stoves. 
</P>
<P>
 During one period, the park service brought in fire hoses to demolish the 
adobe houses after the occupants died. Seven of the houses were destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those that live there live at the whim of the National Park Service," said 
the tribe's attorney, Frederick Marr of California Indian Legal Services. "The 
park service has rules, regulations and restrictions, so the tribe cannot 
practice its religion. . . . They can't gather firewood without special 
permission. If they have bugs in their house, they have to get special 
permission from the park service to use Raid. They're totally restricted." 
</P>
<P>
 Tribe members also have complained about foul smells wafting toward their 
homes from sewer ponds for tourist facilities near the Timbisha village. 
</P>
<P>
 The current park service administration in Death Valley acknowledges that the 
Timbisha were mistreated by previous administrations. 
</P>
<P>
 "They may have some valid complaints," said Linda Greene, a Death Valley 
National Monument cultural resources manager. "Certainly things were done and 
said that would not be done and said today, but we try to look at that as past 
history in working out a cooperative arrangement today. But a lot of those 
resentments are pretty strongly held." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Timbisha acknowledge that relations between the park service and 
the tribe have improved, a residue of resentment and mistrust keeps the 
relationship strained. 
</P>
<P>
 Disputes continue to arise, most recently over the removal of Shoshone 
artifacts. Park visitors can be prosecuted for picking up objects such as 
pieces of basketry or arrowheads, but the tribe complains that the park service 
itself gathers artifacts without consulting them and stores them in the Death 
Valley Museum. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem is we can't leave them on site once they've been discovered, 
because people walk away with them," Greene said. "People have been looting all 
over the monument." 
</P>
<P>
 Death Valley National Monument Supt. Ed Rothfuss said the park service favors 
the establishment of a two-year study period to find suitable lands for a 
Timbisha reservation, which could be either inside the proposed national park, 
entirely outside or some combination. 
</P>
<P>
 But Rothfuss said park officials have some concerns about how the Timbisha 
would develop their land. 
</P>
<P>
 "The National Park Service would want some assurance that those uses to which 
the tribe may put those lands would be compatible with the purposes and the 
spirit of a national park," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "For example, things like developing a motel, restaurants, or gift shops would 
be acceptable. Activities like high-rise apartments or a car dealership would 
not be compatible. . . . A gaming casino would be a totally incompatible 
concept." 
</P>
<P>
 The Timbisha have said they would only build houses and facilities such as a 
store, gas station and curio shop. 
</P>
<P>
 Referring to their their quest for a reservation, Goad said, "I hope this 
works, because we want houses. Then a lot of our tribe will come back."

4 BROTHERS AND THEIR UNCLE DIE IN OCEANSIDE FIRE; TRAGEDY: THE BOYS, FOR WHOM 
THE MAN WAS BABY-SITTING, RANGE IN AGE FROM 6 MONTHS TO 4 YEARS. A PRIEST SAYS

 Four young brothers and their uncle died of apparent smoke inhalation Monday 
morning after a fire engulfed their Oceanside apartment. 
</P>
<P>
 Firefighters responded shortly after 8 a.m. to a report of smoke curling from 
the windows of a ground-floor apartment in the eastern section of the city. 
Battering in the door of the apartment, they found two of the boys and their 
uncle dead, and two other boys unconscious and barely clinging to life. The 
latter two were taken by helicopter to San Diego's Children's Hospital about 20 
miles away, where they were pronounced dead in the emergency room. 
</P>
<P>
 Fire Chief Dale Geldert said the fire, of unknown origin, began in a closet of 
the master bedroom. The boys were found sprawled in a hallway; their uncle, who 
was baby-sitting, was found on a bed in a smaller bedroom. 
</P>
<P>
 The dead were identified as Joseph Arriola, 21, and his nephews Joshua, 4; 
Jesse, 3; Joseph, 2, and Jeremiah, 6 months. The apartment, as required by law, 
was equipped with a smoke detector and investigators are attempting to 
determine if it was working. 
</P>
<P>
 The detector was found melted. "If it worked, it didn't wake anybody up," said 
Fire Marshal Ted Wackerman. 
</P>
<P>
 The fire was reported by an upstairs neighbor whose smoke detector had gone 
off. 
</P>
<P>
 The children's parents, Jesse and Angela Arriola, apparently were at work when 
the fire began. The mother and the father, a Marine lance corporal stationed at 
Camp Pendleton, both arrived shortly after the firefighters knocked down the 
blaze. 
</P>
<P>
 The father, who has been in the Marine Corps for four years, was overcome by 
emotion and had to be led away. 
</P>
<P>
 Accompanied by other Marines, the parents went to Mission San Luis Rey to pray 
with Father Warren Rouse, guardian of the mission and a family friend. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are in a state of shock, grief, despondency and anger; all these 
emotions are mixed up," Father Rouse said. "They didn't know the other two 
children were dead. I had to tell them." 
</P>
<P>
 Natives of Guam, the couple often attended services at the mission parish. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were my boys," the North County Blade-Citizen quoted Jesse Arriola as 
saying as he left the mission. "I want them back." 
</P>
<P>
 Thirty-one firefighters, five engines and three ambulances responded to the 
fire, with the first arriving within four minutes. Attempts to resuscitate the 
victims were futile. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was just too late when we got there," said a Fire Department spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
 The fire was the most deadly in Oceanside history and the second tragedy to 
hit Oceanside and Marine families recently. 
</P>
<P>
 Three young women and two children were killed May 25 at Camp Pendleton when 
their speeding car went out of control and crashed into a transit district bus. 
All of the women were married to Marine enlisted men.

CONNECTICUT FINDS THIRD CASE OF FLESH AND MUSCLE-EATING BACTERIA

<TEXT>
<P>
 A third case of bacteria that can eat away muscle and flesh was reported 
Monday and doctors tried to reassure the public that the strain does not affect 
most people. 
</P>
<P>
 "As far as we're concerned, it's not a public health problem . . . . We're 
talking about a very rare disease," said Dr. James Hadler, chief epidemiologist 
for the state Health Department. 
</P>
<P>
 A man and a woman, both in their 30s, were admitted separately to Norwalk 
Hospital last month with virulent forms of the streptococcus bacterium. Another 
case was reported to state health officials Monday but a spokesman said he did 
not have specifics. 
</P>
<P>
 The man hospitalized last month remains in critical condition. He was 
diagnosed with necrotizing fasciitis, which eats away the flesh. The woman was 
diagnosed with pyomyositis, which attacks muscle tissue, and was in 
satisfactory condition. 
</P>
<P>
 Necrotizing fasciitis gained attention last month when Britain's Public Health 
Laboratory Service reported 15 people had been diagnosed with the disease this 
year and 11 of them had died.

HIGH COURT OPENS DOOR TO RAPE SUITS BY INMATES; PRISONS: RULING PUTS WARDENS ON 
NOTICE THAT THEY CAN BE SUED IF PRISONERS ARE IN DANGER OF ASSAULT. CASE PUTS 
SPOTLIGHT ON WIDESPREAD PROBLEM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The Supreme Court made it somewhat easier Monday for prisoners to win damages 
if they have been raped behind bars, ruling that prison officials can be held 
liable if they know an inmate is in clear danger of assault, yet do nothing to 
prevent it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Being violently assaulted in prison is simply not part of the penalty that 
criminal offenders pay for their offenses against society," said Justice David 
H. Souter for the court. "Having incarcerated persons with demonstrated 
proclivities for antisocial criminal, and often violent, conduct . . . , having 
stripped (inmates) of virtually every means of self protection . . . , the 
government and its officials are not free to let the state of nature take its 
course." 
</P>
<P>
 The 9-0 ruling reinstates a lawsuit filed by a young transsexual with 
decidedly "feminine characteristics" who says he was beaten and raped just days 
after federal officials sent him to a maximum security prison in Terre Haute, 
Ind. 
</P>
<P>
 The inmate, Dee Farmer, had been convicted of credit card fraud. His lawsuit 
seeking damages for alleged rape had been dismissed without a trial by two 
lower courts. 
</P>
<P>
 While Monday's ruling is not a clear victory for the inmate, it puts state and 
federal wardens on notice that they can be sued if they ignore an "obvious 
risk" to the health and well-being of their prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
 The case has put a national spotlight on an apparently widespread but often 
ignored problem: sexual assault behind bars. 
</P>
<P>
 The group Stop Prisoner Rape, founded by an anti-war protester of the 1960s 
who was raped in a jail cell, told the justices that it estimates 290,000 
inmates are sexually assaulted annually. A 1982 study of a California prison 
found that 14% of the inmates there had been assaulted. In the era of AIDS, a 
sexual assault in prison can result in a death sentence for the victim. 
</P>
<P>
 In a concurring opinion, Justice Harry A. Blackmun said that he hopes prison 
officials will "fulfill their affirmative duty" to end this "reign of terror" 
practiced by one group of inmates against another. 
</P>
<P>
 In his 25-page opinion for the court, Souter set out a middle-ground position 
for deciding claims from prisoners who contend their constitutional rights have 
been violated. 
</P>
<P>
 In doing so, he rejected the sharply contrasting standards set forth by the 
American Civil Liberties Union and the federal Bureau of Prisons. 
</P>
<P>
 Representing the inmate, the ACLU said that officials who fail to remedy 
obviously "inhumane conditions" should be held liable. Souter disagreed, saying 
that officials cannot be held liable if they are unaware of the problem or 
acted "reasonably" in trying to cope with it. 
</P>
<P>
 But he also rejected the contention of state and federal officials who said 
they should be immune except when they have "actual knowledge" that one inmate 
is likely to assault another. If a danger facing inmates is "longstanding, 
pervasive and well-documented," top officials can be held liable even if they 
did not know about a specific instance, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is enough that the (prison) official acted or failed to act despite his 
knowledge of a substantial risk of serious harm" to the inmate, Souter said. 
</P>
<P>
 In tone and substance, Monday's opinion differs sharply from more conservative 
rulings on prison conditions issued in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1991 case of Wilson vs. Seiter, Justice Antonin Scalia said that 
inmates could not win suits over prison conditions unless they could prove that 
an official had a "culpable state of mind." At the time, advocates for 
prisoners' rights said they feared the ruling would quash most, if not all, 
suits challenging the adequacy of prison conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 But last year, the court ruled that it could constitute "cruel and unusual 
punishment" to house a nonsmoking inmate with a cellmate who smoked five packs 
of cigarettes a day. Only Justices Scalia and Clarence Thomas dissented from 
that conclusion in the case of Helling vs. McKinney. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, only Thomas refused to sign Souter's opinion (Farmer vs. Brennan, 
92-7247). Instead, he reiterated his view that the 8th Amendment's ban on cruel 
and unusual punishment does not cover prison conditions because only "judges or 
juries -- but not jailers -- impose punishment." 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, Thomas joined his eight colleagues in voting to revive the 
inmate's lawsuit to give him a chance to prove that federal prisons officials 
knew he was in danger of being raped but still sent him to a "violent 
institution with a history of sexual assault." 
</P>
<P>
 Advocates on both sides of the case found something to like. 
</P>
<P>
 Stephen Donaldson, president of Stop Prisoner Rape, applauded the ruling and 
said it "opens the door to class-action lawsuits seeking major changes in 
prison systems. This has been a problem of massive denial," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Maryland state attorney Andrew Baida, who filed a brief on behalf of 35 
states, predicted the decision will shield officials "from being exposed to 
exorbitant costs. If they acted in good faith, this means they will not be 
liable," Baida said.

STAR WHITE TIGER AT ZOO IN MIAMI KILLS KEEPER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A rare white Bengal tiger, one of the star attractions at Miami's sprawling 
suburban zoo, fatally mauled a zookeeper Monday after the man entered the 
animal's outdoor exhibit. 
</P>
<P>
 Veteran zookeeper David Marshall, 45, was killed after he entered the moated 
enclosure apparently unaware that the tiger was still uncaged, said Metrozoo 
spokesman Ron Magill. He said that the death occurred during a time of day when 
the 350-pound male tiger, named Lucknow, was to be moved from one enclosure to 
another. 
</P>
<P>
 There were no witnesses and, although the death was believed to be accidental, 
county homicide officers said they would investigate. 
</P>
<P>
 "As beautiful, as majestic, as approachable as these animals seem to be, 
there's the old saying, 'You can take the animal out of the wild, but you can't 
take the wild out of the animal,' " said Magill, a friend of Marshall's who was 
close to tears at a morning news conference. "Unfortunately, that's been proven 
today." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if the tiger would be destroyed, Magill answered: "Nothing happens to 
the tiger. The tiger was just being a tiger. 
</P>
<P>
 "To condemn the tiger would be to compound the tragedy. People have a 
misconception that they are pets. Nothing could be further from the truth. This 
is what we would expect a tiger to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Magill said that Marshall had to ignore or overlook several safety features at 
the tiger exhibit to have entered the paddock where the tiger roamed. 
"Everything seems to point to human error," said Magill. 
</P>
<P>
 Marshall, a Metrozoo employee for 11 years, had no pulse when found by other 
zoo employees after he failed to respond to a call on the radio. He had 
suffered severe cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 Deaths caused by zoo tigers are considered extremely rare. Tiger expert Ron 
Tilson of the Minnesota Zoo said that he could remember "one, maybe two such 
incidents in the U.S. in the last seven years." By comparison, an average of 
one person a year is killed by zoo or circus elephants in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Lucknow and his sister Kampur were acquired 10 years ago from the Cincinnati 
zoo, where they were born. Although extremely popular with zoo visitors, white 
tigers are controversial among many zoologists since most in captivity result 
from selective breeding of parents and offspring with the same genetic 
mutation. 
</P>
<P>
 Tilson, tiger species coordinator for the American Assn. of Zoological Parks 
and Aquariums, has deplored the practice of such in-breeding.

IDEAS; DOOMSAYERS OF OVERPOPULATION SOUND A NEW JEREMIAD; FEARS ARE VOICED THAT 
HUMAN NUMBERS WILL OUTSTRIP THE MEANS OF SUBSISTENCE. THE FOCUS NOW IS LESS ON 
SURVIVAL THAN ON THE QUALITY OF LIFE. 
</P>

<P>
 Maybe it's because eerie new diseases are cropping up to foil the finest 
medical minds. Maybe it's because nations are unraveling and hurling legions of 
refugees around the world. Or worries of forests falling, deserts spreading, 
species disappearing, ozone vanishing and cities bursting at the seams. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe it's a periodic fad for the intellectual nail-biters. Or maybe, now, the 
Jeremiahs of doomsday are right. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the reasons, an old fear is emerging anew: Calamitous global 
overpopulation. 
</P>
<P>
 "The most important question in the world is whether human beings are wise 
enough to see what's coming," says Denis Hayes, organizer of the original Earth 
Day in 1970. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, as executive director of the environmentalist Bullitt Foundation in 
Seattle, Hayes is among a growing number of credible public figures sounding 
the alarm. And this time the argument is less about human survival than the 
quality of life. 
</P>
<P>
 "Today's global population cannot ever be sustained at anything approaching 
the current lifestyles of the United States or Europe or Japan," Hayes says. 
</P>
<P>
 Two hundred years ago, Englishman Thomas Malthus crystallized the population 
argument for Western intellectuals: "Population, when unchecked, increases in a 
geometrical ratio. Subsistence only increases in an arithmetical ratio." 
</P>
<P>
 Ever since, population doomsayers have been known as Malthusians. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost a century later, Charles Darwin joined the case. "Man tends to increase 
at a greater rate than his means of subsistence; consequently he is 
occasionally subjected to a severe struggle for existence." 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly 100 years after that, Paul Ehrlich foretold of impending calamity in 
his highly charged 1968 book, "The Population Bomb." 
</P>
<P>
 But each time, after furious debate, popular concern waned. And the world's 
population continued to grow -- from 2.5 billion people in 1950 to 5.6 billion 
today, on the way to 6 billion in the year 2000 and perhaps 9 billion by 2025 
or 2030. 
</P>
<P>
 Powerful social forces work against serious public consideration of 
overpopulation. Religion for one. For another, overpopulation implies the need 
for population limitations. And that raises the impossible question: For whom? 
</P>
<P>
 Today, more than 90% of the population growth is occurring in the developing 
world. At the same time, industrialized nations gobble some 80% of the world's 
production. Between these two numbers lies the inevitable formula for ethnic, 
racial and cultural strife. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe just as significantly, overpopulation suggests that human ingenuity 
itself has limits, an idea that so far has not taken deep hold. Improvements in 
agriculture and technology have disproved previous doomsday prophecies. Why 
won't they always? 
</P>
<P>
 Over the decades, a good many experts on both sides of the issue found 
themselves settling on an uneasy consensus: Prosperity was the root problem, 
not population. Once a nation's standard of living rose, its population rate 
would decline -- just look at the industrialized nations, which have stable or 
even dropping rates of reproduction. 
</P>
<P>
 Make people rich and they will lower the birthrate. 
</P>
<P>
 But that consensus is being challenged by those who would turn the prosperity 
argument around. Overpopulation, they contend, is the foremost barrier to 
universal well-being. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, a Cornell University team led by ecologist David Pimentel 
published an exhaustive study of the world's cropland, water, energy and 
consumption. The study concluded that the world can support only 2 billion 
people at a universal standard of living now enjoyed by industrialized nations. 
</P>
<P>
 "As human populations continue to grow, prosperity and quality of life can be 
expected to decline," Pimentel said. The report suggests that these changes can 
be seen already, even in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 The findings are by no means unique. In 1992, 1,600 scientists -- including 
more than half of the living Nobel laureates in science -- signed a declaration 
to the world's leaders: "No more than a few decades remain before the chance to 
avert the threats we now confront will be lost and the prospects for humanity 
immeasurably diminished." 
</P>
<P>
 Former Colorado Sen. Timothy E. Wirth will represent the United States at the 
United Nations population conference in Cairo this fall. And he already has 
made his position clear: 
</P>
<P>
 "Overpopulation growth is the overwhelming issue of the 21st Century. 
Overpopulation will overwhelm all our political institutions, all our economic 
institutions; it will destroy the environment around us and erode any 
opportunities that we have to provide quality of life to the people in the 
world." 
</P>
<P>
 There are some signs that everyday citizens are reaching the same conclusion. 
In recent years demographers have noticed that, contrary to the accepted axiom, 
population rates are decreasing in some countries even though prosperity is not 
rising. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a rather profound situation and is not well understood," Hayes says. 
He attributes the change to the increasing status of women in the world and the 
spread of more efficient birth control. Even when confronted with cultural 
taboos, these women are "making trade-offs between having more kids and having 
some degree of comfort." 
</P>
<P>
 "If we all want to live like peasants, there is room for 20 times more people 
than if we want to live like the luckiest of us today," Hayes says. "You and I 
and the rest of us can say what we want, but the people who will determine the 
future are the tens of millions of girls age 12 to 18 around the world." The 
Global Impact 
</P>
<P>
 Even if world economies could comfortably sustain the rising population, the 
toll on resources would be tremendous. Developed nations consume resources at a 
rate far out of proportion to their populations. 
</P>
<P>
 Heavy Users 
</P>
<P>
 * Super consumers: Each American consumes 23 times more goods and services 
than the average Third World citizen. 
</P>
<P>
 * Richer diet: Americans consume 570 pounds of dairy products per year, 
compared with a worldwide average of 170 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 * Indirect consumption: Feed grains for food-producing animals are consumed at 
a rate of 1,460 pounds per capita in the United States, compared with 255 
pounds for the rest of the world. 
</P>

6 PROTESTERS CHARGED IN FIRST USE OF LAW TO SHIELD ABORTION CLINICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 In the first use of a new federal law banning abortion clinic blockades, six 
demonstrators were charged Monday with blocking access to a reproductive health 
clinic in Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
 The constitutional protection to seek an abortion "is a hollow right and a 
nonexistent choice when a few individuals take it upon themselves to close 
medical clinics, threaten medical providers and intimidate patients," said 
Thomas P. Schneider, U.S. attorney in Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
 The six protesters allegedly used two vehicles, chains and concrete to block 
access to Affiliated Medical Services on Saturday, closing the clinic near 
downtown Milwaukee for about 90 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 If convicted under the law, which President Clinton hailed as a blow against 
"extremism and vigilantism" when he signed it 11 days ago, the six 
demonstrators face maximum punishment as first-time offenders of six months in 
jail and $10,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
 Two anti-abortion groups are challenging the Freedom of Access to Clinic 
Entrances Act, commonly called FACE, in court actions in Washington and 
Alexandria, Va. 
</P>
<P>
 The six persons charged in the Milwaukee incident are Dale Robin Pultz, 32; 
James Daniel Soderna, 31; Michael Charles Suhy, 20; Ronald Dean Brock, 55; 
Colin Lester Hudson, 46; and Marilyn Ruth Hatch, 43.

STEADY ECONOMIC GAINS THROUGH '96 SEEN; FINANCE: PRESIDENT'S ADVISERS PREDICT 
ANNUAL GROWTH OF 2.5% TO 3% WITH RELATIVELY MILD INFLATION AND LOW 
UNEMPLOYMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The nation's economy will continue its recent pattern of steady growth through 
the 1996 election year, expanding at an annual rate of 2.5% to 3%, with 
relatively mild inflation and low unemployment, President Clinton's top 
economic advisers predicted Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The moderate-growth, low-inflation scenario envisioned by the President's 
economic team would represent "an extremely successful" track record that could 
boost his chances of being elected to a second term, said Robert E. Rubin, 
Clinton's assistant for economic policy. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the rosy hue of the White House forecast, the latest economic 
indicators and current business conditions indicate that "the odds favor it," 
Rubin said. The economy expanded at a rate of 3% during the first quarter of 
1994 and many analysts say that is about as fast as it can grow over long 
periods of time without rekindling inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 Rubin acknowledged that the Administration will have to be "watchful" to 
ensure that the economy does not begin to overheat, thereby putting pressure on 
prices to rise and prompting the Federal Reserve Board to raise interest rates, 
potentially choking off the recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton, in an ABC-TV interview, said there is no compelling evidence that a 
significant increase in inflation is on the horizon. He said the Federal 
Reserve should not raise interest rates again as long as price increases do not 
begin to accelerate. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fed has boosted short-term interest rates four times since February in an 
effort to prevent the economy from growing too rapidly. Although the central 
bank has not ruled out additional increases, Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan has 
indicated that he thinks rates have risen enough for now. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking to reporters in a luncheon interview, Rubin and his deputy, Gene 
Sperling, said they believe that the economy is "on track" to produce the 8 
million new jobs that Clinton, in his 1992 presidential campaign, said his 
economic program would create by 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 Sperling said that 3.4 million new jobs, including about 3.1 million in the 
private sector, were created during Clinton's first 16 months in office. 
Moreover, the job growth continued during the last quarter despite a 
significant decline in government spending, a feat that is "almost 
unprecedented in this century," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Reaching the goal of 8 million new jobs might earn political points for the 
President, but some economists would not be overly impressed. Allen Sinai, an 
economist with the Lehman Brothers investment firm, said Clinton's economic 
team has been "low-balling" its job creation goals. In a typical cyclical 
recovery, he said, total job creation could be expected to reach 10 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's target is "well-intentioned but I think it's not very much," said 
Sinai, who has advised both the Clinton and George Bush administrations on 
economic policy. "If it's only 8 million, I could only give them a gentleman's 
'C.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Some Administration officials have lamented the fact that many of the jobs 
created since the recovery began are temporary or in the service sector, where 
wages tend to be lower. 
</P>
<P>
 Rubin, who made a fortune estimated at more than $100 million as a Wall Street 
financier, said business executives clearly respect what the President has done 
to reduce the federal deficit. But he said they are not "coalescing" the way he 
thinks they should around a White House economic program that is favorable to 
business. 
</P>
<P>
 Many business executives still have reservations about Clinton, Rubin said, 
noting that some of them are Republicans and apparently have difficulty 
perceiving any Democrat as pro-business. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of looking at the 70% of the Clinton economic program that reflects 
their interests, Rubin said, business executives tend to "look at the 30% they 
don't like, and disregard the art of what is politically doable." 
</P>
<P>
 Rubin expressed frustration that despite the growth, Clinton gets relatively 
little credit from the American people, who, according to polls, have serious 
reservations about the President's character. 
</P>
<P>
 The character issue, revolving around allegations of womanizing and financial 
improprieties while Clinton was Arkansas governor, should focus on his 
activities since he became President, Rubin said.

JET DEAL BOOSTS MOSCOW'S ARMS EXPORTS; MILITARY: SALE OF 18 MIGS TO MALAYSIA IS 
BIGGEST IN YEARS. IT SHOWS RUSSIA HAS LEARNED TO COMPETE IN WORLD MARKET. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Russian arms exports, pushing to break out of their post-Cold War slump, are 
expected to gain their biggest boost in years today when Moscow closes a 
$550-million deal to supply MiG-29 fighter jets to Malaysia. 
</P>
<P>
 The 25-year contract, to be signed in Kuala Lumpur, not only provides Russia 
with its first major new post-Soviet arms customer but indicates that its 
government weapons merchants are starting to get the hang of the rough world 
market, experts say. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a breakthrough," said Alexander Konovalov, a military policy analyst 
at Moscow's USA-Canada Institute. "Russia has spoken about the necessity to 
appear in the civilized arms market. This is the first case where we 
practically reached this goal." 
</P>
<P>
 The Russian victory after a grueling two-year battle for the contract portends 
new fights ahead for U.S. competitors, who have come to dominate the Third 
World arms market since the Soviet Union's collapse. 
</P>
<P>
 Malaysia is also ordering eight F-18 fighters put out by the McDonnell Douglas 
Corp. and 28 British-made Hawk aircraft. But it was the request for 18 MiGs 
that broke ground, amounting to Russia's first big incursion into the growing 
Southeast Asian arms market. 
</P>
<P>
 At Rosvooruzheniye, the new government-controlled company created in February 
to bring order to the export of Russian weaponry, marketers touted the 
Malaysian sale as a sign that they were learning the flexibility needed to 
compete. 
</P>
<P>
 "This shows that Rosvooruzheniye is perfecting its work, becoming more able to 
do complex deals to meet the interests of our customers . . . what other 
suppliers were already offering," said Anatoly Tomashevich, head of 
advertising. 
</P>
<P>
 Malaysia will pay 20% to 25% of the cost of the 18 MiGs in supplies of palm 
oil, according to the Itar-Tass news agency, which said Moscow's willingness to 
accept that payment-in-kind was what clinched the deal. 
</P>
<P>
 Palm oil is used largely in the manufacture of soap, cosmetics and margarine. 
</P>
<P>
 Moscow's arms exports slumped in the early 1990s, in part because it gave up 
client-states that it had supplied with weapons for political reasons without 
getting much in payment. 
</P>
<P>
 But Russia's arms income also dropped because it complied with international 
sanctions against Iraq, Libya and the former Yugoslav federation, losing what 
nationalists here say would have been billions of dollars in sales. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite those losses, China and India remain good customers, and Russia sold 
about $2 billion in arms altogether in 1993. But officials here also complained 
bitterly that they were being blocked from the international market by U.S. and 
other competitors. 
</P>
<P>
 Oleg N. Soskovets, the Russian vice premier who arrived in Malaysia on Monday 
to sign the MiG deal, griped just last month that "competitors of Russia are 
trying to drive us out of the world weapons market." 
</P>
<P>
 Russian officials also acknowledge, however, that their poor sales were partly 
their own fault -- they had gone from one extreme to another, from propping up 
allies with easy credit to demanding cash for every deal. Now, they say, they 
are learning to offer sweeteners such as "offset" deals, which allow buyers to 
do more of the production in their own countries. 
</P>
<P>
 For the United States, the Russian arms exports are good and bad. They may 
take business away from the U.S. arms industry, which could cost more jobs in 
factories already hurting from the drop in domestic demand. On the other hand, 
said Konovalov of the USA-Canada Institute, the world should hope Russia makes 
progress in legitimate arms exports -- because otherwise it may resort to 
supplying pariah states. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a dangerous situation if Russia is pushed out of the civilized market," 
he said. "These weapons will appear in some other place."

DISPUTE OVER PIPELINE PUTS U.S., TURKEY ON COLLISION COURSE FOR CONFRONTATION; 
DIPLOMACY: ANKARA WANTS THE OIL LANGUISHING IN CONDUIT FROM IRAQ. WASHINGTON 
SAYS U.N. SANCTIONS FORBID IT. 
</P>

<P>
 The United States and Turkey are heading toward a major confrontation over 
U.N.-imposed economic sanctions against Iraq, specifically the ban on Turkey's 
use of an oil pipeline between Iraq and the Mediterranean. 
</P>
<P>
 The dispute potentially threatens the cohesion of the U.S.-led coalition 
trying to squeeze Iraqi President Saddam Hussein from power, according to U.S. 
and Turkish analysts. "Keeping the coalition in line is getting increasingly 
difficult," a leading U.S. analyst said. "There are real stresses and strains." 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, the dispute could strain relations between the United States and a 
strategic North Atlantic Treaty Organization ally. It could even jeopardize the 
future of the embattled Kurdish minority in Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
 The confrontation centers on a deal that Turkey quietly worked out with Iraq 
this spring to reopen the pipeline after flushing out 12 million barrels of oil 
that have been sitting in it since Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait. Turkey, in a 
serious recession, badly needs the revenue from the oil. In exchange for access 
to the oil, Turkey would send Iraq food, medicine and other humanitarian goods. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration moved quickly to block the deal on the grounds that 
it violated U.N. sanctions. U.N. Ambassador Madeleine Albright and U.S. 
Ambassador to Turkey Richard Barkley formally protested to ranking Turkish 
officials, Turkish and U.S. officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Turkey pleaded its case on the basis of Article 50 of the U.N. Charter, which 
allows a third party adversely affected by sanctions to appeal for relief. 
</P>
<P>
 Turkey claims that sanctions have cost it $20 billion in lost business with 
Iraq since 1990, a figure deemed high by U.S. officials. The pipeline alone has 
cost more than $500,000 in annual losses for Turkey, according to Phebe Marr, a 
senior fellow at the National Defense University here. In the late 1980s, 
before sanctions, Iraq was the second largest customer for Turkish exports. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the government of Turkish Prime Minister Tansu Ciller argued that 
the pipeline would corrode unless it was flushed. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration countered with a compromise allowing the initial 
flushing plus one or two others for pipeline repairs and economic relief. 
</P>
<P>
 But at the United Nations, Britain, France and Russia demanded that the 
compromise include payment from the pipeline's revenues to the U.N. 
Compensation Commission that was set up after the 1991 Persian Gulf War to 
oversee Iraqi reparations for war damage, according to Turkish sources. 
</P>
<P>
 The sanctions allow Iraq to sell its oil to buy humanitarian goods. But 30% of 
its profits must first go to the U.N. commission, and as much as 10% more can 
be taken by the United Nations to cover its operating expenses in Iraq. Of the 
12 million barrels in the pipeline, 8.2 million barrels belong to Iraq and 3.8 
million barrels belong to Turkey. 
</P>
<P>
 Unless a compromise is worked out, Ciller's government has threatened 
implicitly to block renewal of Operation Provide Comfort when it comes up for 
review in Parliament at the end of this month. Operation Provide Comfort, which 
has been increasingly controversial in Turkey, where it is based, provides 
humanitarian aid and air protection for Kurds living in northern Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
 The end of Operation Provide Comfort probably would enable Hussein to reabsorb 
Kurdistan, which rose up against his regime after the Persian Gulf War. A 
subsequent crackdown led nearly 2 million Kurds to flee to the borders of Iran 
and Turkey in 1991 -- and to the coalition's intervention with Provide Comfort. 
</P>
<P>
 "Solidarity is not a one-way street," Ozdem Sanberk, Turkish undersecretary 
for foreign affairs, told The Times. "We stood up with the coalition and 
assumed a huge responsibility, which we still have. We now have a problem as a 
result of the embargo that needs to be addressed by our partners." 
</P>
<P>
 Turkey's economic problems have begun to take a major toll. On May Day this 
year, tens of thousands of workers protested the impact of the government's 
austerity program and their country's 100% annual inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the moment, there is an uneasiness in our Parliament and a perception that 
there is not sufficient care by our partners," said Sanberk, who was in 
Washington last week and at U.N. headquarters in New York on Monday to try to 
work out a compromise. "The government needs to be able to show public opinion 
that the problems are being addressed." 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials are playing down the immediate dangers of a rift. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once the government looks at the strategic trade-offs, the prime minister 
will see Provide Comfort as the most important thing we're doing together in 
the post-Cold War world," a senior official said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration also thinks that a further short-term accommodation 
can be reached by the coalition allies. But a compromise with Turkey is 
unlikely to end the saga. 
</P>
<P>
 First, Iraq still has leverage. Turkey will have to go back there to get 
approval of any new formula. And in the past, Hussein's regime has refused to 
sell its oil to pay for humanitarian goods rather than pay a percentage to the 
United Nations. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Iraqis are in the driver's seat as far as the Turks are concerned," a 
U.S. official said. "They can say: 'This is the way we want to do it, or we 
won't let it happen at all.' Then the Turks have to make a tough choice." 
</P>
<P>
 Iraq sees the Turkish deal as a means of undermining the sanctions regime and 
potentially breaking up the coalition, U.S. officials say. Opening up the 
Turkish front would be the beginning of the end of sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
 But U.S. aid, which is shrinking, is not an alternative to end Turkey's 
economic woes. Since the Cold War's end, aid to Turkey has been cut back from 
about $900 million six years ago to less than $300 million for fiscal 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Second, resolution of the immediate dispute will not solve either the broader 
problems that led Ciller to try to revive the pipeline or Turkey's fundamental 
new differences with the allies. 
</P>
<P>
 Turkey has concluded that Hussein will survive sanctions, diplomatic isolation 
and other efforts to end his 15-year rule. Its domestic and regional policies 
are now based on those tenets, U.S. officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast, U.S. policy is to continue the sanctions and politically squeeze 
Iraq until Hussein is ousted. If the U.N. sanctions are lifted, Washington is 
expected to continue a unilateral economic embargo. 
</P>
<P>
 Turkey's new assessment already has led the coalition to suspect that the 
pipeline deal would not be a onetime arrangement. Ciller has said publicly that 
she intends to continue to sell oil through the pipeline. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's not being very cool about the way she goes about asking for favors," a 
U.S. official said. 
</P>
<P>
 Because oil experts differ on whether the pipeline has been damaged by 
prolonged inactivity, U.S. analysts also suggest that Turkey's argument may be 
a pretext to set a precedent. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, pipelines cannot be left empty without the risk of damage. So 
after the flushings, it would have to be immediately filled again -- thus 
creating the same situation as today, Turkish analysts say.

HONORING THE HEROES OF THE LONGEST DAY; D-DAY NOTEBOOK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Veterans' chow: In Arromanches, the center of the British observances Monday, 
protests by thousands of British veterans caused bar and restaurant owners to 
reverse a ruling by authorities to close down cafes at 2 p.m. as part of the 
ceremonies. While the edict by Major Jean Paul Le Conte was meant to honor 
D-Day guests, most bar and restarateurs complained that the thousands of 
veterans would have no place to eat or drink. 
</P>
<P>
 A comedian's recall: Bob Hope was back at Normandy aboard the Queen Elizabeth 
II cruise liner, carrying veterans for a D-Day observance, telling some of the 
same jokes that served him so well through World War II. His own D-Day memory: 
"I was doing a show at a camp at Van Nuys when the news about D-Day came, so I 
changed the show and made it more serious," he said aboard the QE2. 
</P>
<P>
 Medic: Five D-Day veterans who parachuted into Normandy nursed minor injuries 
Monday, with one hospitalized for tests for back pains. Earl W. Draper, 70, of 
Inverness, Fla., had a rough landing near Sainte-Mere-Eglise on Sunday after 
his main parachute tangled and he was forced to use a smaller emergency chute 
during a re-enactment of D-Day paratroop jumps. "He doesn't have any 
fractures," said Guy Adam, a hospital spokesman in Caen. "He's suffering from 
trauma to the spinal column, but he doesn't have any neurological problems." 
Draper's family is back home and he will be flown back soon -- lying down, Adam 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bad flashbacks: Memories of war triggered by the D-Day celebrations could 
plunge veterans and their families into depression, some British psychologists 
say. Elderly soldiers subjected to constant media bombardment of the 
anniversary may suffer sudden swings in mood not realizing the underlying cause 
of their distress. "People could find themselves with nightmares, strong 
intrusive memories or find themselves likely to burst into tears," said Ian 
Robbins, a clinical psychologist. A survey of 1,000 World War II vets found: 
</P>
<P>
 50% still troubled by memories 
</P>
<P>
 20% suffer severe signs of stress Quotes 
</P>
<P>
 "You completed your mission here. But the mission of freedom goes on; the 
battle continues. The longest day is not yet over." 
</P>
<P>
 -- President Clinton 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this is our common victory over fascism, and we are not simply 
Americans, Russians, Brits and Canadians. We are inhabitants of the Planet 
Earth. We are the crew of one large spacecraft."

O.C. OBSERVANCE EVOKES MEMORIES FOR VETERANS; REMEMBRANCE: SMALL GATHERING AT 
NIXON LIBRARY RELIVES THE MOMENTOUS DAY IN WHICH THE SOLDIERS OF DEMOCRACY 
PREVAILED OVER THE FORCES OF TOTALITARIANISM.

 Thomas McLaughlin, an 82-year-old Brit who fought in Normandy, found Monday's 
observance of the 50th anniversary of D-day at the Richard Nixon Library & 
Birthplace a rare chance to say hello and shake hands with a few Yanks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fifty years ago," he told former Sgt. Norbert G. Blaskowski, "I was a private 
in the British army. It was the 2nd Battalion. I remember crossing (the English 
Channel) in a large ship loaded with army vehicles." 
</P>
<P>
 Blaskowski, now 73 and living in Lake Forest, was in the 26th Field Artillery 
Battalion, one of thousands of American soldiers who stormed Utah and Omaha 
beaches. Canadian and British soldiers such as McLaughlin landed on beaches 
code-named Juno, Sword and Gold. 
</P>
<P>
 Though Orange County's official observance of the 50th anniversary of the 
Allied invasion of Normandy attracted only 60 people to the Nixon library 
Monday, it was filled with emotion by the handful of World War II veterans who 
attended. 
</P>
<P>
 The keynote speaker, Leland Bellot, a history professor at Cal State 
Fullerton, began by thanking the El Toro Memorial Park program committee, which 
sponsored Monday's event, for giving him an opportunity to repay an old debt. 
</P>
<P>
 Bellot recalled growing up in a Texas refinery town on the Gulf Coast. His 
father, Bellot said, "worked to produce the high-octane gasoline needed in the 
war." 
</P>
<P>
 But for Bellot, it was a time of watching the men in his neighborhood leave 
for the war, "some never coming back. . . . These were my heroes." 
</P>
<P>
 Those early experiences spawned an intense interest in the Battle of Normandy, 
Bellot said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The significance of D-day," he said, "was that it was an end to a period of 
European supremacy. Normandy saw the United States as the dominant power of 
Europe and the world. Today, more certainly than ever, we can recognize that 
D-day symbolizes the victory of democracy over totalitarianism." 
</P>
<P>
 To the Nazis, the Allied troops were "soft, undisciplined individualists," 
surely unworthy to crush the Third Reich, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Allied commanders admitted that they could not save the day," Bellot 
said. "So it came down to a small number of men huddled at Omaha Beach -- many 
who lost their company commanders. They took charge and pushed forward at their 
own initiative . . . these extraordinary ordinary men, soft, undisciplined 
individualists went forward and saved a continent." 
</P>
<P>
 The El Toro Memorial Park committee's goal, said chairwoman Judy Deeter of 
Mission Viejo, is to provide programs throughout the year with a theme of 
honoring World War II veterans and their families. 
</P>
<P>
 "We honor all veterans but are specifically honoring World War II veterans," 
Deeter said. Events, which started in 1991, will be scheduled through Veterans 
Day of 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 McLaughlin's daughter, Maureen Bunnell of Fullerton, said her father was 
visiting Orange County from Australia, where he now lives, when she noticed a 
newspaper item on Monday's event. "It sounded like a great opportunity for 
him," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Another veteran on vacation happened on the event as he and his wife were 
touring the library. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just drove over on vacation from Arizona," Louise Ballard said, "and we 
wanted to visit the Nixon library. I saw this flyer outside and I said, 'Bruce, 
you were at Normandy. Let's go inside and see.' So here we are!" 
</P>
<P>
 Bruce Ballard, 70, said he was part of a demolition team in an engineers' 
combat group that attacked Utah Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "I used to think I wanted to go back to Normandy and go through the whole bit, 
you know, see everything I saw there earlier," Ballard said. "But it's all 
pretty emotional. I just can't do it."

CLINTON CALLS D-DAY 'LEAST ORDINARY DAY OF CENTURY' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By The text of President Clinton's speech commemorating D-day, delivered at the 
American Cemetery in Colleville-sur-Mer, France: 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mr. (Joseph) Dawson, (a highly decorated American D-day veteran), you did your 
men proud today. Gen. (John M.) Shalikashvili (chairman of the Joint Chiefs of 
Staff), Mr. (Walter) Cronkite (former CBS newsman), chaplain, distinguished 
leaders of our government, members of Congress, members of the armed services, 
our hosts from France and most of all, our veterans, their families and their 
friends: In these last days of ceremonies, we have heard wonderful words of 
tribute. Now we come to this hallowed place that speaks, more than anything 
else, in silence. 
</P>
<P>
 Here on this quiet plateau, on this small piece of American soil, we honor 
those who gave their lives for us 50 crowded years ago. Today, the beaches of 
Normandy are calm. 
</P>
<P>
 If you walk these shores on a summer's day, all you might hear is the laughter 
of children playing on the sand, or the cry of sea gulls overhead, or perhaps 
the ringing of a distant church bell. The simple sounds of freedom barely 
breaking the silence. Peaceful sounds. Ordinary sounds. 
</P>
<P>
 But June 6, 1944, was the least ordinary day of the 20th Century. On that 
chill dawn, these beaches echoed with the sounds of staccato gunfire, the roar 
of aircraft, the thunder of bombardment. And through the wind and the waves 
came the soldiers, out of their landing craft and into the war, away from their 
youth and toward a savage place many of them would, sadly, never leave. 
</P>
<P>
 They had come to free a continent -- the Americans, the British, the 
Canadians, the Poles, the French Resistance, the Norwegians and others. They 
had all come to stop one of the greatest forces of evil the world has ever 
known. 
</P>
<P>
 As news of the invasion broke, back home in America, people held their breath. 
In Boston, commuters stood reading the news on the electric sign at South 
Station; in New York, the Statue of Liberty, its torch blacked out since Pearl 
Harbor, was lit at sunset for 15 minutes; and in Newcastle, Pa., a young mother 
named Polly Elliot wrote to her husband, Frank, a corporal in the Army, "D-day 
has arrived. The first thought of all of us was a prayer." 
</P>
<P>
 Below us are the beaches where Cpl. Elliot's battalion and so many other 
Americans landed -- Omaha and Utah, proud names from America's heartland, part 
of the biggest gamble of the war, the greatest crusade, yes, the longest day. 
</P>
<P>
 During those first hours on bloody Omaha, nothing seemed to go right. Landing 
craft were ripped apart by mines and shells; tanks sent to protect them had 
sunk, drowning their crews; enemy fire raked the invaders as they stepped into 
chest-high water and waded past the floating bodies of their comrades. And as 
the stunned survivors of the first wave huddled behind the seawall, it seemed 
the invasion might fail. 
</P>
<P>
 Hitler and his followers had bet on it. They were sure the Allied soldiers 
were soft, weakened by liberty and leisure, by the mingling of races and 
religion. They were sure their totalitarian youth had more discipline and zeal. 
But then something happened. 
</P>
<P>
 Although many of the American troops found themselves without officers, on 
unfamiliar ground, next to soldiers they didn't know, one by one they got up. 
They inched forward and together, in groups of threes and fives and tens, the 
sons of democracy improvised and mounted their own attacks. 
</P>
<P>
 At that exact moment, on these beaches, the forces of freedom turned the tide 
of the 20th Century. These soldiers knew that staying put meant certain death. 
</P>
<P>
 But they were also driven by the voice of free will and responsibility 
nurtured in Sunday schools, town halls and sandlot ballgames -- the voice that 
told them to stand up and move forward, saying, "You can do it. And if you 
don't, no one else will." And as Capt. Joe Dawson led his company up this 
bluff, and as others followed his lead, they secured a foothold for freedom. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, many of them are here among us. Oh, they may walk with a little less 
spring in their step, and their ranks are growing thinner, but let us never 
forget, when they were young, these men saved the world. 
</P>
<P>
 And so let us now ask them, all the veterans of the Normandy campaign, to 
stand if they can and be recognized. 
</P>
<P>
 The freedom they fought for was no abstract concept. It was the stuff of their 
daily lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Listen to what Frank Elliot had written to his wife from the embarkation point 
in England: "I miss hamburgers a la Coney Island, American beer a la Duquesne, 
American shows a la Penn Theater, and American girls a la you." 
</P>
<P>
 Pauline Elliot wrote back on June 6th as she and their 1-year-old daughter 
listened on the radio: "Little Daronda is the only one not affected by D-day 
news. I hope and pray she will never remember any of this, but only the 
happiness of the hours that will follow her daddy's homecoming step on the 
porch." 
</P>
<P>
 Well, millions of our GIs did return home from that war to build up our nation 
and enjoy life's sweet pleasures, but on this field there are 9,386 who did not 
-- 33 pairs of brothers; a father and his son; 11 men from tiny Bedford, Va., 
and Cpl. Frank Elliot, killed near these bluffs by a German shell on D-day. 
</P>
<P>
 They were the fathers we never knew, the uncles we never met, the friends who 
never returned, the heroes we can never repay. They gave us our world. And 
those simple sounds of freedom we hear today are their voices speaking to us 
across the years. 
</P>
<P>
 At this place, let us honor all the Americans who lost their lives in World 
War II. Let us remember as well that over 40 million human beings from every 
side perished -- soldiers on the field of battle, Jews in the ghettos and death 
camps, civilians ravaged by shellfire and famine. May God give rest to all 
their souls. 
</P>
<P>
 Fifty years later, what a different world we live in. Germany, Japan and 
Italy, liberated by our victory, now stand among our closest allies and the 
staunchest defenders of freedom. 
</P>
<P>
 Russia, decimated during the war and frozen afterward in communism and Cold 
War, has been reborn in democracy. And as freedom rings from Prague to Kiev, 
the liberation of this continent is nearly complete. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the question falls to our generation. How will we build upon the sacrifice 
of D-day's heroes? Like the soldiers of Omaha Beach, we cannot stand still. We 
cannot stay safe by doing so. 
</P>
<P>
 Avoiding today's problems would be our own generation's appeasement, for just 
as freedom has a price, it also has a purpose, and its name is progress. 
</P>
<P>
 Today our mission is to expand freedom's reach farther, to tap the full 
potential of each of our own citizens, to strengthen our families, our faith 
and our communities, to fight indifference and intolerance, to keep our nation 
strong and to light the lives of those still dwelling in the darkness of 
undemocratic rule. 
</P>
<P>
 Our parents did that, and more. We must do nothing less. They struggled in war 
so that we might strive in peace. We know that progress is not inevitable, but 
neither was victory upon these beaches. Now, as then, the inner voice tells us 
to stand up and move forward. Now, as then, free people must choose. 
</P>
<P>
 Fifty years ago, the first Allied soldiers to land here in Normandy came not 
from the sea but from the sky. They were called pathfinders, the first 
paratroopers to make the jump. 
</P>
<P>
 Deep in the darkness, they descended upon these fields to light beacons for 
the airborne assault that would soon follow. Now, near the dawn of a new 
century, the job of lighting those beacons falls to our hands. To you who 
brought us here, I promise we will be the new pathfinders, for we are the 
children of your sacrifice. 
</P>
<P>
 Thank you, and God bless you all.

DOUBLY DECISIVE DESIGNATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Once more, for those who may have missed it. . . . Just what does "D-day" 
mean? 
</P>
<P>
 Military historians remind that it is the consummate redundancy: The D in 
D-day stands for "Day." 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, the H in H-hour (as in "D-day will begin at H-hour") stands for -- 
yes, "Hour."

CHINESE JET CRASH KILLS ALL 160 ABOARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A Chinese passenger jet crashed and broke into pieces Monday less than 10 
minutes after takeoff from the popular tourist city of Xian, killing all 160 
people aboard. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the dead were two Americans, six Italians and one Swiss, according to 
the Foreign Ministry and the official New China News Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the worst reported aviation disaster ever in China, where officials 
blame an alarming increase in the number and seriousness of accidents on the 
rapid growth in air traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 The news agency confirmed there were no survivors aboard the plane, which 
crashed in a field south of Xian. There was no word on the cause of the crash. 
</P>
<P>
 The Soviet-made Tupolev-154, operated by China Northwest Airlines, crashed at 
8:20 a.m. in a rural area of Changan County, directly south of Xian and about 
600 miles southwest of Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
 The flight, which was en route to the southern city of Guangzhou, was carrying 
146 passengers and 14 crew, the news agency said. 
</P>
<P>
 A woman who answered the phone at the Xian headquarters of China Northwest 
Airlines said that it had been raining at the time of the crash. China 
Northwest has no relationship to the U.S. carrier Northwest Airlines.

TIMBER SALES BAN LIFTED; LITTLE IMPACT SEEN

<P>
 A ban on timber sales that has brought logging ever closer to a standstill 
across the Northwest was lifted Monday by the federal judge who imposed it 
three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 But the order was not expected to shake loose much -- if any -- new timber in 
the short term, as legal challenges await the Clinton Administration's proposal 
for managing the 24 million acres of federal land in the forests of Washington, 
Oregon and Northern California that are home to the threatened spotted owl. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. District Judge William A. Dwyer also agreed to the government's offer 
that it provide at least 30 days' notice of any new timber sales to all of the 
parties now challenging the Adminstration plan in his Seattle court. More than 
a dozen environmental groups have brought five lawsuits against the Clinton 
proposal since it was submitted in April. The timber industry also has filed 
two lawsuits against the plan in Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
 Dwyer imposed the ban in 1991, saying it would remain in effect until the 
federal government presented a comprehensive plan that would assure protection 
of the spotted owl. When the Administration presented its formal vision for 
managing the forests -- Clinton's attempt to straddle environmental and 
industry concerns -- it asked that the injunction be lifted. 
</P>
<P>
 In doing so Monday, Dwyer wrote that his action does not rule one way or the 
other on the Clinton plan. He set Sept. 12 as the date he will begin hearing 
oral arguments on that proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's plan, known as Option 9, eventually would allow for 1.1 billion 
board feet to be logged annually in the owl forests, one-quarter of the 
historic highs of the late 1980s. Some U.S. Forest Service estimates have said 
that 600 million board feet might be sold in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Lauri Hennessey, a spokeswoman for the Administration's timber team in 
Portland, Ore., said the effect of giving all parties notice of new sales -- 
plus the time it takes the Forest Service to prepare a sale -- would severely 
limit the amount of timber sold over the summer. 
</P>
<P>
 "The gritty truth is that not much can be done in the next three months," she 
said. "This does not mean that the nightmare is over" for timber communities in 
the region, she added, "but we're a step closer to showing that the government 
is following the law." 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for the timber industry said Dwyer's order would change nothing. 
"This is a non-event," said Mark Rey, vice president of the American Forest and 
Paper Assn. "There is so little (timber) available to sell," he said, and the 
advance notice requirement gives the environmental groups "pretty much all the 
ammunition they need" to challenge sales.

AFTER SOME TRAFFIC DELAYS, FOUNDERS GET IT IN GEAR; POP MUSIC: WINWOOD AND 
CAPALDI FOCUS ON THEIR TOUR, WHICH STOPS TONIGHT IN ANAHEIM, AND ON A NEW 
ALBUM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Steve Winwood and Jim Capaldi ran into an unexpected roadblock when they tried 
to resurrect Traffic after 20 years: They didn't have the rights to use the 
name of the rock band they founded. 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Blackwell's Island Records U.K. owned the moniker. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we were 19 or 20, he got us to sign a piece of paper, which we didn't 
believe existed," Winwood said. "He faxed copies to everyone." 
</P>
<P>
 So, after Winwood and Capaldi had completed a Traffic comeback album this year 
for Virgin Records (for which Winwood records), the lawyers were called in. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was more loaded in his (Blackwell's) favor than ours. They played 
hardball," Winwood said, and Traffic bought its name from Island. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for Blackwell said the agreement with Traffic prohibits him from 
commenting; however, Island is releasing a box set of Winwood material -- from 
1964 to '91, including Traffic stuff -- later this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The legalities over the name delayed the release of Traffic's new album, "Far 
From Home," and thus slowed momentum for the band's current concert tour, which 
stops tonight at The Pond of Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 In a summer dominated by such veteran acts as the Eagles, Barbra Streisand and 
the Rolling Stones returning to touring after lengthy absences, the Traffic 
trek seems to have hit a few bumps in the road. Industry observers report that 
Traffic tickets have been less-than-hot items in many major markets. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, Winwood and Capaldi's enthusiasm for the venture was palpable -- 
in an interview, during a band rehearsal, and onstage on opening night last 
month in Minneapolis, where Traffic sounded better than ever. 
</P>
<P>
 The musicianship was superior, and Winwood, one of rock's most soulful 
vocalists, was impassioned not just in his singing but also in his guitar and 
keyboard playing. 
</P>
<P>
 Just why did Winwood -- who had his share of solo success in the 1980s with 
"While You See a Chance," "Higher Love" and "Roll With It" -- decide to direct 
Traffic again? 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been talking about it for a while," he answered. "It wasn't a financial 
consideration. It seemed a natural progression. I felt to a certain extent that 
my music was lacking some of the ragged edges that the Traffic music has in it. 
</P>
<P>
 "The desire was to write in a way that paid no lip service to any kind of 
market force. The only parameters we had were . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 "Freedom," Capaldi interjected. "With Traffic, you don't have to preconceive 
where you're going. That's the beauty of it." 
</P>
<P>
 Winwood denies the speculation that he revived Traffic because his solo career 
has been foundering after two consecutive slow-selling albums. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have no idea that Traffic is going to be any more successful than my solo 
albums," he said. "No one has a crystal ball." 
</P>
<P>
 Multi-instrumentalist Winwood, 46, and lyricist-drummer Capaldi, 49, made "Far 
From Home" in much the same way they made the old Traffic albums: They repaired 
to a farmhouse in Ireland and jammed. But this time they were without flutist 
and saxophonist Chris Wood, a band member who died in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
 So Winwood used electronic samples for the reeds and woodwind parts. For the 
tour, he and Capaldi hired four sidemen, including bassist Rosko Gee, who 
played with the 1974 incarnation of Traffic, and 
saxophonist-flutist-keyboardist Randall Bramblett, who has accompanied Winwood 
on his post-Traffic tours. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Why wasn't Dave Mason, Traffic's founding guitarist, involved? 
</P>
<P>
 Even though Traffic is prominent on his resume, Mason played with the band for 
only one year and never toured the States with Traffic.  
</P>
<P>
 "Dave was never cut out to be in a group," Winwood said (even though Mason has 
joined the latest incarnation of Fleetwood Mac). "He's much more of a solo 
artist, we felt, and he did some great solo work."  
</P>
<P>
 "Far From Home" is full of the kind of long-winded rock-blues-soul-jazz-folk 
jams that made Traffic a staple on FM radio from '67 to '74. Winwood said he 
and Capaldi did not set out to make a "retro album that sounded like it was 
made in the '60s." 
</P>
<P>
 But, Capaldi added, "the tradition of the old stuff is still there. I don't 
feel we've made sort of a glossy '90s pop album. It's pieces of music rather 
than radio songs." 
</P>
<P>
 In concert, the new songs fit in with the old numbers that dominate the show: 
"Medicated Goo," "The Low Spark of High Heeled Boys," "Glad," "Freedom Rider," 
"Empty Pages" and "John Barleycorn," among others. 
</P>
<P>
 At the moment, Winwood and Capaldi seem to be drowning in a sea of joy. But 
they don't know what the future holds for Traffic. "With Traffic," Capaldi 
said, "it's like jumping into the ocean without a ticket and a boat and a route 
while crossing the Atlantic." 
</P>
<P>
 * Traffic plays tonight at 8 at The Pond of Anaheim, 2695 E. Katella Ave., 
Anaheim ($23.50-$27.50), (714) 704-2400); Thursday through Saturday at the 
Universal Amphitheatre, 100 Universal City Plaza, Universal City, ((818) 
980-9421), and June 16 at the Glen Helen Blockbuster Pavilion in Devore, ((909) 
886-8742).

HOWARD ROSENBERG / TELEVISION: FROM E. ROOSEVELT TO 'ROSEANNE': WHAT A 
'CENTURY'!

<P>
 Eulogies inevitably inflate their subjects, sometimes almost beyond 
recognition. Thus, when Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis died last month, "remarkable 
woman" was the stamp affixed to her in homage after homage. 
</P>
<P>
 Why remarkable? Well, her admirers say, she was an elegant, great-dressing 
First Lady who responded bravely to the murder of her husband, raising two 
swell kids in the process. Yes, just as countless other spouses of murder 
victims have carried on. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, the argument goes, she could have lived off her wealth, but instead 
chose later in life to work at a job in publishing. Yes, just as other widows 
work outside the home. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, she had style. Yes, and unlike other Americans, 100 million bucks to 
indulge it. 
</P>
<P>
 This is not to diminish Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, who surely had many 
admirable qualities, only to urge against loosely conferring the term greatness 
. For a glimpse of the truly remarkable, tune in the TBS cable production "A 
Century of Women," an entertaining, high-aiming, three-night biography of U.S. 
women, some of which rises to the epic level of those landmark PBS 
documentaries "Civil War" and "Eyes on the Prize (I and II)." 
</P>
<P>
 For much of this century, women were relegated to a sort of benign servitude 
on the white man's plantation. Men have set the agendas for women in this 
real-life "Father Knows Best," their paternalism reaching even to small, subtle 
things that society takes for granted, such as men being the ones who drive the 
family car and lead in ballroom dancing. And too often, women have allowed 
themselves to be defined by men, such as blustery Rush Limbaugh's snide 
labeling of radical feminists as "feminazis." 
</P>
<P>
 Not this time, though. 
</P>
<P>
 "A Century of Women" is not only about women, but also mostly by women, with 
Jacoba Atlas as executive producer, Sylvia Morales, Judy Korin and Christen 
Harty Schaefer directing the documentary portions and Barbara Kopple directing 
fictional family sequences that are used to bridge various topics. 
</P>
<P>
 With Jane Fonda narrating, "A Century of Women" unfurls its story with vintage 
film, testimony from historians and other prominent women, along with diaries, 
letters and personal memoirs of important female figures whose words are read 
off-camera by a collection of fine actresses, ranging from Jodie Foster to 
Meryl Streep. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite occasional soapbox tendencies and a few striking omissions, "A Century 
of Women" is largely a shining, valuable survey, one affirming that a 
documentary needn't sacrifice smarts and scholarship to align itself with the 
mainstream of TV's pop culture. The only real bummers here are Kopple's 
gratingly intrusive, cloying, just-too-precious fictional pit stops, with 
Teresa Wright, Olympia Dukakis, Talia Shire, Justine Bateman, Brooke Smith, 
Madge Sinclair and Jasmine Guy cast in awkwardly conceived roles that are 
supposed to flesh out common denominators and generational gaps among women. 
Good cast, bad idea. 
</P>
<P>
 On to different ideas. The first diaphragm? The first bra? The first First 
Lady who became an influential social reformer (Eleanor Roosevelt)? They're all 
here, along with the story of labor crusader Pauline Newman (the voice of Amy 
Irving), who survived the shocking working conditions and 1911 fire at the 
notorious Triangle Shirtwaist Factory in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The latter episode opens tonight's two-hour premiere, directed by Morales and 
titled "Work and Family." We hear from labor reformer Elizabeth Gurley Flynn 
(Sally Field) and Charlotte Perkins Gilman (Candice Bergen), a shocking radical 
who suggests there is life for women beyond domestic chores, and from Christine 
Frederick (Mary Steenburgen). She was the mother of what became known as home 
economics, the system that helped mechanize a woman's work in the home (making 
it possible for Margaret Anderson to make vacuuming the centerpiece of her day 
in "Father Knows Best"). 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, World War II turns homemakers into factory workers, but when the 
war ends, so do the jobs, and women are advised by men to get their priorities 
straight and return to "the fascinating business of making a home." 
</P>
<P>
 Betty Friedan ultimately surfaces -- urging women to define themselves -- as 
does the lesser-known but equally fascinating Delores Huerta. A schoolteacher 
and mother of 11, she is the United Farm Workers activist who faced farm owners 
across the negotiating table while nursing her babies. 
</P>
<P>
 Part 2 ("Sexuality and Social Justice"), directed by Korin, is both the most 
fascinating and the most irritating of the two-hour segments, with the likes of 
jazz-age poet Edna St. Vincent Millay (Blythe Danner), birth-control pioneer 
Margaret Sanger (Streep), suffragette Alice Paul (Foster) and Mississippi 
voter-registration leader Fannie Lou Hamer sharing time with author Erica Jong 
and sex surveyor Shere Hite. 
</P>
<P>
 There's a jolting TV interview here -- revolutionary for 1957 -- with Sanger 
blasting the Catholic church's male hierarchy for opposing birth control: 
"They're celibates. They don't know love. They don't know marriage. They don't 
know anything about bringing up children, or any of the marriage problems of 
life, and yet they speak to people as if they were God." 
</P>
<P>
 As for irritating, the Supreme Court's landmark Roe vs. Wade decision is 
depicted as a triumph for women wanting control over their own bodies. Fine. 
Yet the anti-abortion crowd is afforded no suffrage on this program. The 
millions of them are disenfranchised, voteless and voiceless here, as if they 
had somehow betrayed their gender by expressing their beliefs. 
</P>
<P>
 In further evidence that this documentary has an agenda, the alleged sexual 
harassment involving Anita Hill and Clarence Thomas is handled curiously. No 
position is taken, but it's tape of Hill's charges -- her testimony before 
senators -- that Korin chooses to show, not Thomas' equally eloquent denial. 
</P>
<P>
 Even while skillfully presenting the flowers of artist Georgia O'Keeffe as an 
erotic metaphor for full creative expression by women, Schaefer's Part 3 
("Image and Popular Culture") is otherwise the flimsiest of the segments. For 
example, it overvalues the influence of Lucille Ball and her ditsy Lucy Ricardo 
character in "I Love Lucy" as role models for U.S. women while understressing 
the relentless, long-term anti-female bias practiced by mainstream television. 
On target, though, is the touting of ABC's "Roseanne" as a powerful positive 
force. 
</P>
<P>
 In the main, so is this documentary. 
</P>
<P>
 * "A Century of Women" airs tonight, Wednesday and Thursday at 5:05 p.m. and 
9:05 p.m. each evening.

SO, WHAT HAPPENED TO THE FRANCHISE?; MOVIES: EDDIE MURPHY'S FILMS USED TO MAKE 
$100 MILLION. 'COP III' IS EXPECTED TO MAKE $50 MILLION TO $60 MILLION 
DOMESTICALLY. SOME SAY HIS CAREER'S IN TROUBLE, BUT OTHERS ASK IF HE IS BEING 
HELD TO A DIFFERENT STANDARD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT W. WELKOS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 He was one of the biggest movie stars of the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 His dozen films have grossed $1.09 billion at the domestic box office. 
</P>
<P>
 With his mischievous smile and knowing twinkle in his eyes, he was a key 
ingredient -- along with Harrison Ford and "Star Trek" -- that year after year 
filled the coffers at Paramount Pictures. His mere name was a franchise. 
</P>
<P>
 But with the release of his latest film, "Beverly Hills Cop III," Eddie Murphy 
is still looking for his next blockbuster. 
</P>
<P>
 Murphy, who commands $12 million a picture ($15 million for sequels), has had 
only fair-to-modest success with his last three outings. 
</P>
<P>
 1992's "Distinguished Gentleman" took in $10.6 million its opening weekend 
($47 million total domestically) and "Boomerang" opened on the Fourth of July 
1992 weekend to $13.7 million ($70 million). 
</P>
<P>
 And, while "Cop III" took in a respectable $20 million in its first week -- 
including the Memorial Day weekend -- and has grossed $28.5 million through 
Sunday, industry sources said it will likely end up making only $50 million to 
$60 million domestically. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of pictures open to $20 million their first week and the studio is 
having a party," said one industry source. "But Eddie is not where Harrison 
Ford and Tom Cruise are. He ain't there anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 Hollywood took note last year when Paramount halted pre-production of "Cop 
III" as projected costs soared to $75 million, only to scale back the budget to 
the $40-million to $50-million range. 
</P>
<P>
 "If Paramount thought he was there (with Ford and Cruise), they wouldn't have 
done the film for less than the original budget," said a film industry source. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fact was that he was once capable of making $100 million time after 
time," said another source. "Now, he has sort of dropped out of that league." 
</P>
<P>
 But while some in Hollywood interpret these figures as proof that the luster 
is coming off Murphy, those close to him get frustrated and wonder if he isn't 
being judged by a different standard than Arnold Schwarzenegger, Kevin Costner, 
Clint Eastwood, Julia Roberts and Mel Gibson -- all of whom have had box-office 
bombs. "A Perfect World," starring Eastwood and Costner, grossed only $31.1 
million last year. Gibson in "The Man Without a Face" made $24.7 million. 
"Dying Young" with Roberts took in $32.3 million. Even Schwarzenegger's "Last 
Action Hero" took a financial bath when it grossed only $50 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "Eddie hasn't failed yet," said John Landis, who directed "Beverly Hills Cop 
III" as well as "Coming to America" and "Trading Places." 
</P>
<P>
 "Eddie Murphy has never been in a flop," added Murphy's manager, Mark Lipsky, 
who admits going a little nuts hearing all this talk about Murphy's career 
being in decline. "All of his movies have made money. What other movie stars 
can claim that? 
</P>
<P>
 "Some actors make films that gross $35 million and nobody says anything," 
Lipsky said. "Eddie makes a film that grosses $20 million in its first week and 
people say it's a flop, that he's in a career crisis!" 
</P>
<P>
 Lipsky contends it is journalists who have portrayed Murphy's career as one in 
decline. 
</P>
<P>
 Premiere magazine, in previewing "Cop III," recently noted: "This looks very 
much like Murphy's last, best hope to get back on top." 
</P>
<P>
 Ebony magazine pointed to the irony, saying Murphy "has not only been the most 
popular black actor, he has been the most popular actor, period. " But it 
added: "Although Murphy is at the pinnacle of his success, some critics 
continue to say the entertainer's movie career has been on the decline . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 Murphy declined to be interviewed for this article, but he recently told 
Ebony, "So if my train stops tomorrow, what am I going to do, hang my head in 
shame? The reality of it is if my career was on the decline, then I wouldn't be 
making movies because they (moviemakers) don't give black people money in 
Hollywood just because they are swell." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In a sense, Murphy is a victim of his success. 
</P>
<P>
 His first film, "48 HRS.," made $75.9 million. "Trading Places" took in $90.4 
million; "Beverly Hills Cop" grossed a phenomenal $234.8 million and its 
sequel, $153.7 million; "Coming to America" made $128 million. Even a critical 
disaster like "The Golden Child" grossed $79.8 million virtually on the 
strength of Murphy's name and a funny trailer. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Rehme, who produced "Cop III," said Murphy reached such heights during 
those years that people now have unreasonably high expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's impossible to expect of someone that they must sustain a constant rise 
in box-office success of their movies," Rehme said. "That is a false guideline, 
but I understand that is the standard many movie stars are held up to." 
</P>
<P>
 Murphy had been riding high in the late 1980s when an impasse developed with 
the studio executives. 
</P>
<P>
 "He began feuding over material," recalled one source. "He claimed they were 
not sending him anything he liked. He kept turning down every project that came 
along, including 'Beverly Hills Cop III.' " 
</P>
<P>
 One key reason Brandon Tartikoff at the time was picked from NBC to run 
Paramount Pictures was to repair the relationship with Murphy, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 Murphy, meanwhile, had been tagged as a problem. He had a horrible reputation 
for showing up late, and he always came with a large entourage that irked some 
at Paramount. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, however, Murphy has made a conscious effort to turn around 
his reputation. Where he fought with Landis during "Coming to America," he had 
no reported problems with him on "Cop III." 
</P>
<P>
 Landis said he has seen a change come over Murphy, who at 33 is not the brash 
youngster anymore. "Eddie Murphy, regardless of what went on between us, this 
is a happy guy right now. He is in a very successful marriage with two 
beautiful children and another on the way." 
</P>
<P>
 Some also believe Murphy, whose next project is a remake of Jerry Lewis' "The 
Nutty Professor," is losing the crossover audience. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no question he has lost some of his white audience," said one source, 
"because otherwise 'Beverly Hills Cop III' would have opened to $30 million." 
</P>
<P>
 One veteran producer said Murphy, rather than reinvent himself, needs to be in 
a movie bigger than himself. 
</P>
<P>
 "He won't do it," added one source, "but he should do a picture that is not 
expensive." 
</P>
<P>
 "Do I think he's over?" said Landis. "I don't. But a lot depends on his choice 
of material and who he works with."

HE'LL ACT FOR FREE AS LONG AS HIS SHIRTS ARE ON YOUR BACK

 Among the many T-shirts that have made Stanley DeSantis a very wealthy man is 
one that reads, "But what I really want to do is direct." Making money hand 
over fist peddling reasonably priced leisure wear is all well and good, but, 
well, what DeSantis really wants to do is act. 
</P>
<P>
 Not at any price, though. There came a point a few years back, on a movie set, 
when DeSantis decided enough was enough. "This was the thing that made me say, 
I can't be in this business: I had a really nice scene at the beginning of the 
movie. I went to all these auditions . . . to get this part. So I got to the 
set. . . . I was so excited, and (the lead actress) wouldn't talk to me -- she 
went to (the director) and said, 'I want my makeup guy to play that part,' 
because she didn't want anyone else touching her. I said, 'What? ' 
</P>
<P>
 "So the (assistant director) came up to me and said, 'Don't worry, you'll 
still get paid.' And I went, 'I'm rich ! I don't care about getting paid! I 
want this part! ' 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't that she didn't like me -- she never ran the scene with me. She 
said, 'No, I don't like how this is going,' and cut me out. I've been cut out 
of movies in the cutting room, but never right before the camera." 
</P>
<P>
 So DeSantis took some time and built up his T-shirt business -- which he began 
on a very modest level in 1975 as a college student, with "Surrender Dorothy," 
the best-selling tweaking of "The Wizard of Oz" -- a company that DeSantis 
reports grossed $18 million last year alone. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, at age 40, he's finally an extremely busy actor. He received acclaim 
for his role in the PBS miniseries "Tales of the City" as Norman, the tenant so 
tragically troubled he could make for a season of "Very Special Geraldo's." 
</P>
<P>
 He will appear in Julie Brown's upcoming Showtime special, "The Attack of the 
5'2" Women" (in a segment titled "He Giva Me No Orgasm: The Lorena Bobbitt 
Story"), as well as Tim Burton's seriocomic biopic about the worst 
cross-dressing moviemaker ever, "Ed Wood." DeSantis also has a recurring role 
as a no-longer-idealistic high school teacher on "My So-Called Life," the 
upcoming ABC fall series from the creators of "thirtysomething," and he is set 
to go before the cameras for director Paul Schrader on an HBO film, 
"Witchcraft." 
</P>
<P>
 And, since his T-shirt company has made him extremely comfortable (he recently 
moved into a nosebleed-high home in the Hollywood Hills), he takes only the 
roles that appeal to him. 
</P>
<P>
 The unassuming gig -- started to pay for college -- soon made him a titan of 
industry. "I think what I am recognized for in the industry is for taking the 
humorous T-shirts to the gift-store level," he says. "At the time, they were 
sold in truck stops, or as fashion T's, but I melded the funny T-shirts into a 
fashion statement. Before, T-shirts like that were never sold in department 
stores. I remember, when I was trying to sell 'Surrender Dorothy,' calling 
Bloomingdale's from my little apartment in New York and they said, 'T-shirts 
are over. You couldn't put a thing on a T-shirt that we would ever buy.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Subsequent shirts -- "Ward, I'm Worried About the Beaver," "Auntie Em -- Hate 
You, Hate Kansas, Taking the Dog, Dorothy," and depicting any number of 
pop-culture heroes (from Rocky and Bullwinkle to Beavis and Butt-head) -- 
proved Bloomingdale's wrong and charted the tides of pop culture. "I couldn't 
go anywhere without seeing someone wearing one of my T-shirts." 
</P>
<P>
 Acting, nonetheless, beckoned. "I came out here at the end of '76 and was a 
regular on 'The Paper Chase' right away. I thought, 'This is easy, this acting 
stuff -- you come to town, they give you a series!' " 
</P>
<P>
 That illusion didn't last long, with a series of blink-and-you'll-miss-him 
appearances in sundry movies -- "Annie Hall," "Saturday Night Fever," "Best 
Little Whorehouse in Texas," "Taking Care of Business," "Postcards From the 
Edge" -- until his friend Julie Brown drew him out of retirement in 1991 for 
her Madonna parody, "Medusa: Dare to Tell the Truth." 
</P>
<P>
 But it was his performance as Norman that started winning DeSantis attention 
-- some of it unwanted. "I've been offered a lot of pedophile parts after that 
-- it made me wonder, how many pedophile parts are there?" DeSantis asks with 
bemusement. "I can see the executives: 'Get Stan DeSantis! He's got a lock on 
pedophiles!' " In London, DeSantis hears, people attend costume parties as 
Norman; and Armistead Maupin, author of "Tales," proudly reported to DeSantis 
that the Rev. Donald Wildmon, in one of his routine harangues against the 
media, has been sending out a fax, asking "Where are your PBS dollars going?" 
and featuring a photo of Norman in his underwear. 
</P>
<P>
 "He added a note, 'See? You've arrived!' " DeSantis says with a laugh. "I 
looked at it and said, 'The only crime being done here is my skinny legs!' I 
can't believe I'm being faxed around in my underwear." 
</P>
<P>
 Though he has been in Los Angeles for near two decades now, DeSantis finds 
himself a veritable fledgling talent as far as the industry is concerned. 
"Casting people ask, 'Why don't I know you?' " he says. "It's interesting to be 
40 years old and to be a new face. 
</P>
<P>
 "Usually at my age, people have to re-evaluate what they want to do in their 
life," DeSantis reflects. "I did all that in my late 20s, early 30s, and am now 
pretty fulfilled."

WELCOME TO THE CRUEL WORLD OF BEN HARPER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BUDDY SEIGAL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Originality is a rare and precious quality. So many influences go into the 
blueprint for a style that it can be exceedingly difficult not to wear them on 
one's sleeve, like a proclamation of taste and experience. When a new artist's 
music jumps out of a speaker fairly screaming something unique, even the most 
jaded ears can be taken aback. 
</P>
<P>
 Such is the case with singer/songwriter/guitarist Ben Harper, who will play 
Wednesday night at the Coach House in San Juan Capistrano. Harper's debut 
album, "Welcome to the Cruel World" (Virgin Records), is a bold statement of 
vision and conviction. His sense of moral outrage at the world around him 
unfolds through a group of well-crafted, memorable tunes featuring his 
delicate, melodic slide playing coupled with soulful, idiosyncratic vocals. 
</P>
<P>
 This personal, decidedly non-commercial artist is taking his bows on a major 
label with a self-produced album -- significant testament both to his 
formidable talent and to his steadfast refusal to be manipulated by the 
corporate mind-set. 
</P>
<P>
 "People have come along in the past -- demons -- saying 'you have to have your 
hair a certain way, you have to dress a certain way, we want to rewrite your 
songs,' " Harper mused during a recent conversation from his home in Los 
Angeles. "I laugh at these people. 'How do you see your image?,' they'd say. 
'How do you see your image?,' I'd say right back. These record companies try to 
change people's connection to the spirit through music. They try to change who 
people are and to make people something they want them to be. 
</P>
<P>
 "So much of what we are is spiritual, and the key to spirituality is through 
creativity. Our creative and spiritual selves are what make us human. When that 
is suppressed and not allowed to grow, I think it really alters who we become, 
and we see evidence of that every day." 
</P>
<P>
 Harper, 24, grew up in California's Inland Empire, a desert region 50 miles 
east of L.A. Born to a musical family, he soaked up and learned from the 
eclectic variety of sounds to which his parents exposed him from early on. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were always instruments in the home; there was music in my house, 
always. I grew up with old 78s as well as my family playing music themselves. 
Blind Willie Johnson, Leadbelly, Woody Guthrie, Dylan, Tim Hardin, the Beatles, 
the Rolling Stones, Bob Marley, Little Feat and on to groups like Nirvana and a 
lot of hip-hop -- I just love good melody, good music. 
</P>
<P>
 "Music has no barriers, except those we restrict it with. The spirit of music 
is more powerful than all of us -- it's stronger than humanity. Without music, 
I think we'd all be dead." 
</P>
<P>
 Harper experimented early on with standard bottleneck playing but soon came to 
rely on the Weissenborn, a single-piece, hollow-neck lap slide guitar made of 
rare Hawaiian koa wood. Only a few of them were ever built by luthier Herman 
Weissenborn in the 1910s and '20s. The instrument's plangent, mournful quality 
accounts in part for the unusual sound that Harper produces. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Aside from its incredible resonance, it sounds great because of the wood," 
Harper said. "The age of the wood separates the good sounding guitars from the 
great. That's what separates a Stradivarius violin from the rest. If this 
guitar was constructed in the 1910s, then the tree that produced the wood is 
from the turn of the 1800s. So the wood is extremely aged and gives it a unique 
sound." 
</P>
<P>
 But perhaps the most distinguishing characteristic of Harper's music is the 
righteous anger he expresses toward a society whose morals, he says, are 
spiraling toward the drain. Unlike the blind fury voiced by so many hip-hop and 
punk/alternative groups, Harper's outrage is tempered by introspection and 
responsibility, as in the haunting "Don't Take That Attitude to Your Grave": 
</P>
<P>
 So you can move your court case way across town .  
</P>
<P>
 You can move it across the whole wide globe .  
</P>
<P>
 But it ain't gonna help your court case  
</P>
<P>
 Up in the sky. . . 
</P>
<P>
 And you dare the children to stay off drugs .  
</P>
<P>
 Now I dare you to stop letting them in .  
</P>
<P>
 And how dare you point your finger  
</P>
<P>
 At a gang out on the street  
</P>
<P>
 While it's you who is committing the sin?  
</P>
<P>
 Now while there's still time to be saved,  
</P>
<P>
 Don't take that attitude to your grave.  
</P>
<P>
 Most of Harper's songs probe similar territory, whether the subject matter is 
topical or universal, earnest or playful. America in 1994 may not host the 
friendliest climate for his socio-political vision, but he said he remains 
nonetheless driven to express his ideals through his music. "What I say has to 
be said." 
</P>

MARKETING / BRUCE HOROVITZ: MAJOR SPONSORS WARMING UP TO THE GAY GAMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRUCE HOROVITZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 First there was Baby Ruth. Then the Reggie Bar. And now the Gay Bar. 
</P>
<P>
 No, it's not a tavern catering to gay customers, but a $2 chocolate bar aimed 
mostly at the thousands of gay and lesbian athletes and spectators expected in 
New York City next week at the Gay Games IV & Cultural Festival, a weeklong 
athletic competition and artistic celebration. 
</P>
<P>
 "It might not sell in Pacific Palisades," said Seth Felson, the Miami Beach 
entrepreneur whose firm, Loring & Matthews, created the Gay Bar to be sold 
during the Gay Games, "but it's bound to sell in New York." 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond novelty candy bars, the Gay Games -- also known as Unity '94 -- are 
giving marketers plenty to chew on and, for the first time since their 
beginning in 1982, are attracting major sponsors on a national scale. A growing 
contingent -- from AT&T to Miller Beer -- has discovered that for a fraction of 
the cost of airing a single TV spot during the upcoming World Cup soccer 
tournament, they can link up in a big way with the Gay Games and speak to 
millions of consumers who have been mostly ignored by major marketers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Virtually every gay person in the country will be aware of who the sponsors 
are," said Andrew Isen, a New York-based consultant who specializes in 
marketing to gays and lesbians. "There will be a positive bottom line for every 
sponsor." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the big-name marketers paying $50,000 to $250,00 for sponsorship status 
are Miller Beer, Hiram Walker & Sons and Naya spring water. AT&T and 
Continental Airlines also have marketing links. And some big companies, 
including Apple Computer and Perrier, are running ads in the program for the 
games, which -- like the Olympics -- take place every four years. 
</P>
<P>
 Some major New York City merchants are also warming up to the Gay Games. 
Bloomingdale's is offering special discounts to the athletes and spectators. 
And last week, Macy's opened a special section at its Herald Square store to 
sell dozens of items -- from T-shirts to tote bags -- featuring Gay Games and 
Unity '94 logos. 
</P>
<P>
 "We consider it forward-thinking for a mainstream merchandiser," a Macy's 
spokeswoman said, adding that the store has never before carried merchandise 
targeted at gays or lesbians. 
</P>
<P>
 "The word is out that there is a substantial gay and lesbian market," said 
Harold Levine, director of marketing for the Gay Games, which take place June 
18-25. "We are probably the highest-profile gay and lesbian event."  
</P>
<P>
 Of the 10,500 athletes expected to participate in the games, more than 2,000 
will arrive from California -- more than from any other state. 
</P>
<P>
 The event follows by one week the 24th annual Los Angeles Gay & Lesbian Pride 
Celebration, a festival and parade taking place in West Hollywood this Saturday 
and Sunday. And it comes at a time when an increasing number of corporations 
are speaking directly to gay and lesbian consumers. The Chicago-based research 
firm Overlooked Opinions estimates there are 18.5 million gays and lesbians in 
the United States who spend a combined $5.1 billion annually. 
</P>
<P>
 That's why companies are paying more and more attention to the market. Earlier 
this year, the Ikea home furnishings chain broadcast the first network TV spot 
whose featured characters were two identifiably gay men. And earlier this 
month, AT&T, which is also a marketing partner with the Gay Games, targeting 
gay consumers by mailing more than a million brochures featuring identifiably 
gay models.  
</P>
<P>
 AT&T will set up booths to attract new customers at the Gay Games, and it will 
sponsor a laser light show at the closing ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our research tells us that these are affluent, well-educated, brand-loyal 
consumers who want high-quality products," said Dick Martin, vice president of 
advertising at AT&T. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller Beer will have signs at most Gay Games venues, and it has been running 
a series of print ads in gay and lesbian publications featuring participants in 
the athletic events. 
</P>
<P>
 "It simply makes good business sense to market to this segment," said Sophia 
Nieves, marketing supervisor at Miller Brewing. 
</P>
<P>
 Naya, the spring water that was the official bottled water of the Los Angeles 
Marathon, has signed on as the official water of the Gay Games, said Stu 
Levitan, general manager of Nora Beverage USA, which distributes the brand 
domestically. 
</P>
<P>
 But some companies, such as Nike and Benetton, which might have seemed like 
logical sponsors, have turned thumbs down on the Gay Games. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's just not the way we're spending our grass-roots sports marketing 
dollar right now," said Keith Peters, a Nike spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Benetton's top public relations spokesman in the United States tried 
to persuade executives at the Italian-based clothing company to sponsor the 
games, senior executives decided against it.  
</P>
<P>
 "There will be plenty of others, like myself, who are disappointed they 
couldn't sell their companies on being sponsors," said Peter Fressola, director 
of communications. 
</P>
<P>
 But there is also lingering concern about consumer backlash from some 
conservative and religious groups, which is why many companies still want no 
part of the Gay Games. For that matter, some companies are publicly playing 
down their links to the games. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of companies want to market directly to gays, but they don't want 
everyone else to know about it," said Michael Goff, editor of Out magazine, a 
gay and lesbian publication that is also a sponsor of the games. 
</P>
<P>
 Continental Airlines, for example is the "official airline" of the Gay Games, 
offering discounted flights to those attending. But it is not particularly 
eager for publicity. "This is not a sponsorship," insisted spokeswoman Peggy 
Mahoney. "It's a convention rate, just like we'd offer to the Democratic or 
Republican conventions." Briefly . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Burbank-based Buena Vista Home Video, a subsidiary of Walt Disney Co., has 
named Venice-based Ground Zero and San Francisco-based Hal Riney & Partners to 
handle creative assignments. . . . Calabasas-based Lockheed Corp. is placing 
its $8-million account in review, now handled by McCann-Erickson/Los Angeles. . 
. . Toluca Lake-based Miller Group was hired by Republic Pictures Corp. to 
promote video distribution of the PBS program "Ghostwriter." . . . The Santa 
Monica agency Kresser/Craig, which has picked up the estimated $4-million 
account for Kaiser Permanente, is about to lose its $4-million account at 
Anaheim-based Clothestime, which is looking for a new agency. . . . Ogilvy & 
Mather/Los Angeles is scouting for new business to replace the $50-million 
Microsoft Corp. account it was forced to resign late last month when its New 
York parent picked up IBM's $400-million account.

UNION BANK OUTLET TO CATER TO LOW-INCOME CUSTOMERS; COMMUNITY: CHECK-CASHING 
CENTER IS INTENDED TO GIVE RESIDENTS AN ALTERNATIVE TO HIGH-COST SERVICES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL A. HILTZIK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With an eye to winning the loyalty of a largely untapped group of potential 
customers -- Los Angeles' working-class immigrants -- Union Bank on Monday 
launched into full-scale competition with the high-cost check-cashing services 
that substitute for banks in many lower-income neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 In a shopping district of heavily Latino Huntington Park, the bank opened what 
may be the state's first stand-alone center combining check-cashing and basic 
banking services. 
</P>
<P>
 Community activists have long decried the absence of traditional bank branches 
in many lower-income communities. And they have objected to the expense of 
check-cashing outlets, which charge an average 3% to 4% fee to cash payroll, 
personal, government and public-assistance checks, as well as additional fees 
to execute money orders their customers use to pay utility and other bills. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's a hell of a tax, 3%," said Richard C. Hartnack, Union Bank's vice 
chairman and group head of community banking, who presided at the 
ribbon-cutting for the bank's new center. 
</P>
<P>
 Hartnack said fees at Union's Cash & Save center will average 1.25% to 1.85% 
of a check's face value; customers who join a check-cashing "club" for an 
additional $12 to $15 a year will also get several free money orders each time 
they use the service. 
</P>
<P>
 Union Bank's fee structure will be slightly less expensive than that at 
Huntington Park's branch of Nix Check Cashing, a 23-location Southern 
California chain. Nix charges a flat 1.6% to cash a check, plus 39 cents for 
money orders up to $1,000 for established customers, and up to 99 cents per 
money order for others. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is competition, but we try to give our customers the best service we can," 
branch supervisor Mari Juarez said. "Most other places don't have the special 
services that we have." Among others, she said, her branch offers customers 
picture identification cards and fax services and accepts utility bill 
payments. 
</P>
<P>
 Four other banks have branches in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Union Bank already operates three Cash & Save outlets out of existing 
full-service branches in Hawthorne, North Hollywood and Bellflower. Besides 
check cashing, the Huntington Park center will offer low-cost savings accounts 
and secured credit cards -- that is, cards enabling customers to charge only as 
much as they have on deposit. The center will also take mortgage and consumer 
loan applications. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an important step in providing competition to check-cashing 
services," said Robert Gnaizda, general counsel for the San Francisco-based 
Greenlining Coalition. 
</P>
<P>
 "But it is not a substitute for opening a full-service branch," he said, 
noting the economic stigma of going without a checking account. 
</P>
<P>
 Hartnack sought to present the new center as a reasonable middle ground 
between opening a new bank branch and leaving communities such as Huntington 
Park underserved. Union Bank spokespersons say the institution plans to open 
more such centers "in areas with high demand." 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no doubt that it's a losing proposition to go into an existing low- 
and moderate-income community that's built out and build a stand-alone branch," 
Hartnack said. "You would be serving a group that doesn't want full banking 
accounts but (rather) check cashing, low-cost savings accounts and secured 
credit cards. It would be like opening a swap meet in Beverly Hills." 
</P>
<P>
 For all that, he said, Union hopes to eventually convert many of its 
check-cashing customers into regular banking clients with checking accounts and 
unsecured credit. 
</P>
<P>
 "In part this will be an educational process," Huntington Park Mayor Richard 
Loya said. "A lot of Latinos don't like banks -- maybe because they were 
cheated by the banks in Mexico."

 Sometimes in Hollywood, the son also rises. 
</P>
<P>
 Having carved out a role in the past 18 months as one of Hollywood's most 
active movie producers, John Davis, son of billionaire Marvin Davis, this week 
becomes the latest entertainment figure to plunge into the much-touted 
interactive business. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis and his partners are launching Catapult Entertainment Inc., which by 
November is expected to begin selling a modem linking video game players by 
telephone lines. The project -- backed by Davis, his father and video rental 
company Blockbuster Entertainment Corp. -- is the first for the newly formed 
Davis Video Enterprises, and it is a reflection of Davis' belief that 
"interactive is coming, and not necessarily through cable." 
</P>
<P>
 The technology, to be unveiled at this week's Digital World convention in Los 
Angeles, would allow people separated by thousands of miles to use existing 
video systems to play games such as "Mortal Kombat" and "Street Fighter" as 
easily as people communicate by computer. Such a development could spur 
nationwide video game tournaments. Some experts say that further down the line, 
the technology could lead to hugely lucrative developments, such as Las 
Vegas-style gaming at home. 
</P>
<P>
 For Davis, the deal is another step in building an entertainment business and 
a personal image distinct from those of his father, whom Forbes estimates as 
one of America's wealthiest individuals, with a net worth of about $1.7 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
 The younger Davis, 39, also owns three small television stations. But the core 
of his operation is Davis Entertainment, a movie production company that lately 
has been making theatrical and TV movies at a prolific pace -- some 16 films in 
18 months either finished, started or about to start. Davis says he has been 
enamored with the industry since his youth, when he watched films at a Colorado 
theater his father owned. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, two Davis Entertainment pictures were among the top-grossing films: 
Paramount's "The Firm," which Davis made with producer Scott Rudin and director 
Sydney Pollack, and "Grumpy Old Men," which was a hit for Warner Bros. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite his success, some colleagues find it hard to delineate Davis' skills 
from the advantage he carries because of his family name. One high-placed agent 
calls Davis "an honest, nice guy" but one who has benefited from "luck, timing 
and cash." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Another calls him "an enigma," and still others say they find it difficult to 
judge how much of a role Davis has in making films because he sometimes teams 
up with very hands-on producers and directors. 
</P>
<P>
 However, others in the industry who know him say he has sometimes been 
unfairly stereotyped as little more than a rich kid enamored with Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 "The reality is that John, because of his family, had a certain entree, but I 
don't think he's used any of his family's money to generate his own projects or 
his own success. That talk is jealous sniping as opposed to reflecting 
reality," said Jeremy Zimmer of United Talent Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Added Tom Pollock, head of MCA's film unit: "There are a lot of sons and 
daughters of rich people in this business, most of whom have not had anywhere 
near the success of John." 
</P>
<P>
 Davis says that about the only advantage he had in Hollywood was getting in 
the door in the early 1980s, when his father owned 20th Century Fox. Since 
then, he said, his family connections have not been an issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't believe I have a leg up," he said. "One, my father is not financing 
any of my movies, and two, studios are financing all my scripts." 
</P>
<P>
 Contrary to the perceptions of some in Hollywood, Davis did not grow up on a 
back lot but rather in Denver, where his father was busy building his fortune 
in oil. Davis earned a master's in business administration at Harvard, where he 
worked on such unglamorous assignments as improving sales at Dunkin' Donuts. 
His suggestion: drive-through windows. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Davis did not exactly have to mail resumes after getting his MBA, 
because his father had by this time bought Fox. The younger Davis got to know 
the business working around the studio, and he says he learned about making 
movies from such future big-name producers as Lawrence Gordon and Joel Silver, 
who were working there at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis launched his company from a bungalow on the Fox lot, which he acquired 
after his father sold the studio to News Corp.'s Rupert Murdoch in 1986. Among 
the friends he made in the early days was Arnold Schwarzenegger, whose 1987 hit 
"Predator" Davis produced. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis' company is now based in a Century City high-rise one floor away from 
his father's. Davis continues to pitch deals to his father -- notably his 
failed but highly profitable takeover attempt for Northwest Airlines in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 The producing skill Davis gets the most credit for is finding good stories. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has an amazing ability to find good material. That's the first, second and 
third job of a movie producer," Gordon said. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis, for example, discovered "The Firm" in 1990 before author John Grisham 
had even secured a publishing deal. The Paramount film, which starred Tom 
Cruise and Gene Hackman, grossed more than $150 million domestically. Davis and 
Imagine Entertainment -- the company run by director Ron Howard and producer 
Brian Grazer -- also nabbed Grisham's current bestseller, "The Chamber," which 
Universal bought for a record $3.75 million to make into a film. The sale was 
based on just a one-page outline at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 As for his specific duties as a producer, Davis acknowledges that he isn't 
always on sets, but he points out that neither are a lot of other producers. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you make 11 movies a year, you're not going to be on the set all the 
time, because it's physically impossible," he said. "I like to hire directors I 
really trust." 
</P>
<P>
 Davis does not discuss the finances of his company, but he is said to now be 
among the small number of producers who earn a $1-million producing fee per 
film along with a percentage of the gross. Davis' other upcoming projects 
include a sequel to "Grumpy Old Men" and a live-action version of "Richie Rich" 
for Warner Bros., the big-budget "Waterworld" with Kevin Costner for Universal, 
and a film based on the '60s TV series "The Man From U.N.C.L.E." for Turner 
Pictures. 
</P>
<P>
 "His experience level has come to a point where he has a tremendous amount of 
confidence. He knows he can get these movies done, and done well," Creative 
Artists Agency's Jack Rapke said. "It's his time, if you will." Davis' Projects

COMPANY TOWN; SPIELBERG SAID TO BE CLOSE TO SIGNING SOFTWARE DEAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY HARMON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Director Steven Spielberg is close to signing a deal to develop educational 
multimedia software with La Crescenta-based Knowledge Adventure, sources close 
to the company said Monday. He also plans to make an equity investment in the 
2-year-old company. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on Spielberg's skills and reputation alone, the deal would eclipse all 
of the partnerships forged so far between entertainment and technology in the 
emerging multimedia industry, members of which are meeting this week at the 
Digital World conference at the Los Angeles Convention Center. 
</P>
<P>
 The partnership would also resolve some of the questions about where the 
Academy-award winning director and producer plans to channel his well-known 
passion for technology. 
</P>
<P>
 And it would send Knowledge Adventure's modest profile skyrocketing -- if only 
because of the Spielberg aura. 
</P>
<P>
 Spielberg, best known for movies such as "Jurassic Park," "Schindler's List" 
and "E.T.," is also something of an expert on interactive software. 
</P>
<P>
 He owns just about every video game player ever manufactured and has helped 
design an adventure game called "The Dig," due out later this year, for 
LucasArts' chief, George Lucas. 
</P>
<P>
 Multimedia developers who knew of Spielberg's interest in investing in their 
field coveted the association not only for the name and the money but also for 
his renowned storytelling skills and solid grasp of interactive technology -- a 
rare combination even in an industry based largely on those two skills. 
</P>
<P>
 Spielberg could not be reached for comment Monday. But in an interview at the 
Consumer Electronics Show last January, he told The Times that he was there 
scouting out educational software firms to buy or invest in. He said he was 
unimpressed with much of the basic math and reading software available on the 
market and was interested in adding entertainment to educational software. 
</P>
<P>
 "There're all sorts of possibilities in education to use this technology to 
make it more fun," he said in January. 
</P>
<P>
 Knowledge Adventure officials declined comment Monday. Sources said a deal 
could be announced as early as today.  
</P>
<P>
 Educational software is one of the fastest-growing segments of CD-ROM 
multimedia software, which combines video, audio, images and text on a shiny 
disc that looks like a music CD. 
</P>
<P>
 Spielberg has said he often judges games and educational programs by how his 
kids, ages 4 and 7, respond to them. So does Bill Gross, a techno-whiz who says 
his whose young son helped inspire him to leave his job at business-oriented 
software maker Lotus Development Corp. to found Knowledge Adventure nearly 
three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The two reportedly hit it off when Spielberg paid a visit to Knowledge 
Adventure last December. The firm is best known for its popular "Adventure" 
CD-ROM series, whose titles include "Dinosaur Adventure," "Space Adventure" and 
"Body Adventure." Plans for the partnership include adding story lines and 
characters to the firm's current titles as well as developing original 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In other interactive Spielberg news, William Morris agent Lee Rosenberg plans 
to hold a cocktail reception today for technology executives, entertainment 
industry officials and medical professionals involved in a project Spielberg 
asked him to put together for his nonprofit Starbright firm and aimed at 
combining technology and entertainment to invent "therapeutic interventions" 
for sick children. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The annual high-tech conference -- which brings together about 1,200 from the 
cable, telephone, computing and entertainment industries, including new-media 
artists and entrepreneurs -- opened with a technical glitch Monday as what was 
apparently a computer malfunction forced attendees to wait in long lines to 
receive their admission badges. 
</P>
<P>
 But the show went on, and true to form, it prompted some cross-cultural 
friction among panelists and participants.  
</P>
<P>
 MCA President Sidney Sheinberg, who participated in a keynote panel discussion 
along with International Creative Management Chairman Jeff Berg and IBM 
Executive Vice President James Cannavino, described the complexities of the new 
world in one of Monday's more memorable remarks: 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the problems many people who talk about merging Hollywood and Silicon 
Valley forget is the enormous legal and financial complexities in so doing. 
It's a little bit like people from Mars talking to people from Earth -- 
forgetting for the moment who comes from which place."

SPRINT AND EDS CANCEL WEDDING INVITATIONS; MERGERS: THE PROPOSED MARRIAGE 
BREAKS UP OVER STOCK PRICE DEMANDS MADE BY THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS FIRM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Joining in the trend toward broken engagements, Sprint Corp. and Electronic 
Data Systems Corp., GM's computer integration subsidiary, said Monday that they 
have cut off their merger talks. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed marriage, designed to combine the two companies into a publicly 
held, $20-billion-a-year telecommunications and computer behemoth, foundered on 
Sprint's insistence that it be valued at a 20% to 30% premium above its market 
price. 
</P>
<P>
 Although EDS and Sprint are roughly equal in market value, Sprint wanted 1.3 
shares of EDS for each of its common shares. General Motors Corp., EDS' parent, 
would offer only 1.1 EDS shares. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts say EDS' market value of roughly $16 billion is complicated by EDS' 
dependence on GM for about 38% of its business. Although GM agreed to continue 
using EDS for 10 years after the company was spun off, there was some concern 
that GM might expect to get EDS' services at a lower price once it was 
independent. 
</P>
<P>
 Each side expressed surprise at the other's stubbornness. GM says the two 
sides had agreed that the deal was a "merger of equals," implying similar 
valuations. Sprint says GM should not have been surprised. 
</P>
<P>
 Sprint and EDS said they are still exploring some form of partnership to take 
advantage of their respective strengths in computing and telecommunications.  
</P>
<P>
 "There may be other ways we can work together to achieve strategic 
objectives," Les Alberthal, EDS chairman and chief executive, and William 
Esrey, chairman and chief executive of Sprint, said in a joint statement. 
</P>
<P>
 The collapse of the Sprint-EDS merger plan is only the latest in a string of 
such deals that have fallen through recently. Bell Atlantic's plan to merge 
Tele-Communications Inc. fell apart after Bell decided its valuation of TCI had 
been too high. That deal's failure was followed by the blowout of several 
similar deals between cable companies and telephone companies. 
</P>
<P>
 One common problem may have been premature disclosure. Sprint and EDS were 
forced to go public with the merger talks three weeks ago because of widespread 
speculation among media and analysts, even though details had not been worked 
through.  
</P>
<P>
 "When you have analysts and the press participating in speculation, it makes 
negotiations difficult," GM spokesperson Toni Simonetti said. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. West's agreement last spring to invest $2.5 billion in Time Warner Inc., 
by contrast, may have been successful in part because it was kept under close 
wraps until every detail was ironed out.  
</P>
<P>
 "It took us two years to negotiate our alliance with Time Warner. We did it 
out of the limelight," said Jerry Brown, a spokesman for U.S. West. "Several 
times we were ready to announce but then backed off. Some of the other deals 
were put together and announced before they were ready." 
</P>
<P>
 But failed deals won't slow the pace of deal making, in the eyes of some.  
</P>
<P>
 "These are soft deals, that's a way of life," said Mario Gabelli, chief 
investment officer at New York mutual funds company Gabelli Funds Inc. He 
predicts a continued strong wave of deal making as corporate executives follow 
the lead of General Electric, with its hostile bid for Kemper Corp. in March. 
</P>
<P>
 Sprint, meanwhile, a weak third in the long-distance telephone market, remains 
on the lookout for partners to help battle AT&T and MCI. The company is 
reportedly talking with Japanese and European phone companies about possible 
alliances.  
</P>
<P>
 Sprint is also talking about working with regional Bell companies to create a 
nationwide cellular network. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, General Motors is expected to keep looking for partners for EDS. 
The auto maker would like to get some of its money out of EDS, a company it 
paid $2.5 billion for and which is now valued at $16 billion.  
</P>
<P>
 GM said Monday it would still consider spinning off EDS if that would help the 
company reach its strategic objectives.

 PepsiCo Inc. to Return to South Africa: The soft drink giant, which pulled out 
of the country in 1985 because of anti-apartheid sanctions, said it will form a 
local bottling joint venture in which black investors will hold a majority 
stake, and that it plans to expand into other countries in the region. Pepsi 
would not disclose the value and certain other details of the investment, 
citing competitive reasons. Egoli Beverages, a U.S.-based partnership 
incorporating African American investors, will initially own 75% of the 
venture.

 Chase Manhattan to Enter Securities Trade: The New York bank said it has 
federal permission to begin underwriting and trading in corporate 
securities.Such approval represents an important step for commercial banks away 
from restrictions -- dating back to the 1930s -- on the involvement by banks in 
securities-related activities. Chase, Citicorp and a few other banks have 
applied for and received permission to underwrite corporate debt securities 
through separately capitalized subsidiaries. They may issue debt in the form of 
securities for public and private companies. Some other banks, including J.P. 
Morgan & Co., Bankers Trust Co., Daughin Deposit Corp., NationsBank and 
Chemical Banking Corp., have received approval to underwrite equities.

NINTENDO FOUND GUILTY IN PATENT CASE; TECHNOLOGY: THE VIDEO GAME MAKER MAY HAVE 
TO PAY MILLIONS IN DAMAGES TO A NOW-BANKRUPT CONNECTICUT COMPANY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A U.S. District Court jury has found Nintendo of America guilty of infringing 
a patent held by a bankrupt computer company, a decision that could cost the 
Redmond, Wash., video game maker hundreds of millions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 The verdict came in a lawsuit filed in 1986 by the trustees of Alpex Computer 
Corp., a Connecticut firm that went bankrupt in 1983. The company claims a 
basic patent on video game consoles that attach to television sets and use 
removable cartridges, and that feature rotating images on the screen. 
</P>
<P>
 Most other video game companies, including Sega and Atari, have already 
reached settlement agreements with Alpex, so the verdict is not expected to 
have broad consequences. The Alpex patent, filed in 1977, expired last week. 
</P>
<P>
 The damages phase of the Alpex-Nintendo trial will begin next month. Alpex 
says Nintendo sold $3.5 billion worth of game consoles and cartridges that 
infringed its patent, and it will seek 10% to 12% of those sales as damages, 
according to attorney Richard Sayler of the Cleveland law firm Jones, Day, 
Reavis & Pogue. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit covers only products introduced by Nintendo before mid-1989, but the 
Alpex estate could pursue additional claims on consoles and games introduced 
after that, Sayler noted. Alpex could also pursue legal action in other 
countries, including Japan, where it holds patents and where Nintendo's parent 
company is based, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nintendo said it will appeal the verdict. 
</P>
<P>
 While large damage verdicts in intellectual property cases are often 
overturned on appeal, the legal system in recent years has become far more 
friendly to individual inventors and small companies that pursue patent claims 
against large corporations. 
</P>
<P>
 Traditionally, Japanese companies have been quick to settle many types of 
lawsuits rather than go to court, in part because they fear juries will be 
biased against Japanese firms. 
</P>
<P>
 But they have grown bolder in recent years, and Nintendo has long been 
aggressive in protecting its own patents and copyrights in U.S. courts.

CABLE MERGER TO MEAN LOSS OF SOME JOBS

 The Irvine headquarters of Times Mirror Cable Television will be relocated to 
Atlanta as a result of the company's planned partnership with Cox Enterprises 
Inc., a move that is expected to lead to the loss of an unspecified number of 
the 200 total jobs here. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would suspect that (Times Mirror Cable's) Irvine (headquarters) would be 
shrunken somewhat in size by virtue of duplication," James O. Robbins, 
president of Cox Cable Communications Inc., Cox's cable unit, said Monday in a 
news conference from Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 Atlanta-based Cox has announced a $2.3-billion plan to merge its cable 
interests with that of Times Mirror Co. to create the nation's third-largest 
cable TV company. It said much of the work done at Times Mirror's Orange County 
cable operation, Dimension Cable -- which employs some 950 people -- is likely 
to duplicate work performed by Cox employees in San Diego County. 
</P>
<P>
 Larry W. Wangberg, president of Times Mirror Cable, is expected to remain with 
Times Mirror in a new capacity. 
</P>
<P>
 Programming changes may also be in the works for a small number of Dimension's 
181,000 Orange County subscribers. The companies say they are exploring a test 
of interactive information and entertainment services to nearly 43,000 homes 
and businesses in an Irvine-based cable network later this year. The network 
includes parts of Tustin and the El Toro Marine Corps Air Station.

 ILFC Signs Aircraft Deal With Dutch Carrier: International Lease Finance Corp. 
in Century City said it agreed to lease at least eight, perhaps 10, new Boeing 
jetliners -- valued at $900 million -- to KLM Royal Dutch Airlines. ILFC, a 
unit of American International Group Inc., will supply at least seven new 
Boeing 767s to KLM on seven-year leases beginning in June, 1995, and certain 
additional new Boeing planes yet to be chosen. ILFC, in turn, will acquire 10 
used Airbus A310 jets from KLM during the next two years.

 Lawsuits Promised Over Sea Turtle Deaths: U.S. environmental groups and the 
Georgia Fisherman's Assn., a shrimp-fishing trade group, said they will sue the 
federal government, alleging that it failed to make foreign shrimpers as well 
as the U.S. fleet curb practices that cause rare sea turtles to drown. Under 
the federal endangered species act, U.S. shrimpers must use turtle-excluding 
devices to avoid trapping the air-breathing turtles under water. The plaintiffs 
-- including Earth Island Institute, the American Society for the Prevention of 
Cruelty to Animals, the Humane Society of the United States and the Sierra Club 
-- want to ban shrimp imports, worth as much as $1.8 billion a year, from any 
of the 80 foreign nations that do not comply.

 OECD Raises Growth Forecasts: The world's rich nations should enjoy more 
economic growth this year and next than previously forecast but will remain 
dogged by high unemployment in the absence of ambitious new policies to ease 
joblessness, senior Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development 
officials said.The officials, in Paris for a two-day OECD ministerial meeting 
opening today, said the organization had revised its growth forecasts upward, 
particularly for the United States and Japan, from those it made six months 
ago. The OECD said it now expects growth for OECD members of 2.6% in 1994 and 
2.9% in 1995, compared to 2.1% and 2.7% in its previous forecast. The revision 
reflects stronger-than-expected U.S. economic expansion.

 GM to Recall 249,000 Camaros, Firebirds: The auto maker said it is taking the 
action on those Chevrolet and Pontiac models of 1991 and '92 because of defects 
in the cars' fuel filler necks.It said General Motors Corp. dealers will 
inspect the cars' fuel systems for cracks or pinholes in the solder used to 
attach the fuel filler neck to the fuel tank. GM said it is not aware of any 
accident, injury or fire related to the defect. Should a crack or pinhole be 
found, GM said, the entire fuel tank assembly will be replaced at no charge to 
the owner. Owners will be notified of the recall by mail.

SUPREME COURT WILL HEAR BANK APPEAL ON ANNUITIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The U.S. Supreme Court said Monday that it will hear an appeal by the Clinton 
Administration and NationsBank Corp., the nation's third-largest bank, of a 
ruling that sharply limits banks' ability to sell annuities. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision will be important for banks wanting to expand into a new type of 
products that generate fees, experts said. "If the court upholds the decision, 
it could shut down a very important area for banks," banking consultant Karen 
Shaw said. 
</P>
<P>
 The justices agreed to review a ruling last year by a U.S. Court of Appeals in 
New Orleans that NationsBank can sell annuities only in towns of 5,000 or fewer 
people. 
</P>
<P>
 Annuities, which are generally sold by insurance agents, pay a stream of 
benefits in exchange for a lump-sum payment. They are often used as a source of 
retirement income. 
</P>
<P>
 Many banks are selling annuities and other products such as mutual funds to 
collect fees and retain customers. Finance companies, brokerages and other 
businesses have been siphoning away bank income generated through making loans 
and taking deposits. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, banks sold $12.2 billion in fixed and variable annuities, 
representing 17% of all individual annuities and 22% of fixed annuities sold 
nationwide. Annuities accounted for 7% of all bank brokerage sales. 
</P>
<P>
 NationsBank, which is based in Charlotte, N.C., in 1989 asked the office of 
comptroller of the currency, which regulates about 3,400 national banks, for 
permission to sell annuities. It won approval on grounds that annuities are 
primarily financial investment products that banks could sell. 
</P>
<P>
 Variable Annuity Life Insurance Co. of Houston, a unit of American General 
Corp., which underwrites and sells annuities, challenged the decision in court. 
</P>
<P>
 A federal judge in Houston upheld the comptroller's decision, but the appeals 
court reversed the ruling, saying annuities have historically been considered 
insurance products and that banks by law cannot sell insurance except in towns 
of fewer than 5,000 people. (A 1916 law upheld by the high court permits banks 
to sell insurance only in small towns.) 
</P>
<P>
 Having the justices uphold the appeals court ruling would "severely restrict 
the participation of banks in the sale of annuity products," said David 
Roderer, a lawyer with Winston & Strawn. 
</P>
<P>
 Appealing to the Supreme Court were NationsBank and the Justice Department, 
which acted on behalf of the comptroller. Supporting them were a number of bank 
trade associations. 
</P>
<P>
 "The enhanced competition resulting from permitting national banks to sell 
annuities, although feared by the insurance industry, is an important benefit 
to consumers looking for the best deal on a retirement vehicle," Comptroller of 
the Currency Eugene Ludwig said. 
</P>
<P>
 Justice Department attorneys noted that New York's highest court recently 
upheld a state regulatory decision allowing state-chartered banks to sell 
annuities. They said the U.S. Supreme Court should rule that federal law 
permits national banks, wherever they are, to act as agents in selling 
annuities. 
</P>
<P>
 Phil Anderson of Independent Insurance Agents of America said his group 
"continues to stand behind the wisdom" of the appeals court ruling. 
</P>
<P>
 The high court will schedule oral arguments in the case during the term that 
starts in October. A decision is expected early next year.

NEXTEL AIMS FOR ALL-DIGITAL, SEAMLESS WIRELESS NETWORK; TELECOMMUNICATIONS: 
U.S. MOBILE RADIO PROVIDER TO INVEST $165 MILLION IN MEXICAN COMPANY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nextel Communications Inc. said Monday that it will invest $165 million for a 
22% stake in Corporacion Mobilcom of Mexico, creating the first seamless, 
all-digital wireless communications network in North America. 
</P>
<P>
 Rutherford, N.J.-based Nextel, which provides mobile radio services in major 
U.S. cities, recently announced a similar deal with Clearnet Communications 
Inc., a leading Canadian wireless communications company. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the tentative agreement, Nextel would buy $122.5 million of new and 
outstanding shares in Mobilcom, a leading wireless telecommunications provider 
in Mexico. Mobilcom would merge with its affiliate, Radiophone, before closing 
the deal. 
</P>
<P>
 Nextel would also loan Mobilcom another $42.5 million through a note that is 
forgivable under certain conditions. It could also be converted at Mobilcom's 
option into an additional stake of up to 7.65% in the company. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, Nextel has a three-year option to buy an additional 13% of Mobilcom 
for $96.9 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Mobilcom is majority-owned by the Valladares Group, a privately owned Mexican 
company with interests in telecommunications, broadcasting, publishing, steel, 
construction and agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
 Its other shareholders include Associated Communications Corp. unit Associated 
SMR Inc., Wireless Ventures of Mexico Inc. and an affiliate of the Carlyle 
Group. 
</P>
<P>
 Separately, Associated Communications said it expects about $15 million in 
proceeds from Nextel's purchase of a 5% stake in Mobilcom from Associated SMR. 
The unit now holds a 19.9% stake in Mobilcom and 10.03% of Radiophone. 
</P>
<P>
 Nextel and Mobilcom have agreed to pursue sharing frequencies along the border 
between the United States and Mexico. Nextel said that would create additional 
capacity for Nextel's U.S. network, particularly in San Diego, Southern 
California and along the Texas-Mexico border. 
</P>
<P>
 "The North American Free Trade Agreement adds to the significance of the 
Nextel-Mobilcom alliance," said Brian McAuley, Nextel's president and chief 
executive. 
</P>
<P>
 "Integrated, all-digital wireless communications will no longer stop at the 
border and will instead become a powerful stimulant for business and commerce 
among North American countries," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mobilcom and Clearnet will use Motorola Integrated Radio System technology, 
the same technology chosen by Nextel. 
</P>
<P>
 Nextel stock was unchanged at $37.50 in Nasdaq trading.

FIRED EXECUTIVE COUNTERSUES DONNA KARAN, CLAIMS FRAUD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Bloomberg Business News 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Donna Karan Co.'s former chief financial officer sued the fashion design 
company in New York State Supreme Court, accusing it of firing him because he 
had insisted on disclosing that the company overstated its 1993 earnings. 
</P>
<P>
 Former CFO David Golden filed his lawsuit five days after the company had sued 
him, accusing him of gross negligence and lewd statements toward the fashion 
design firm's female executives. 
</P>
<P>
 Golden's lawsuit, filed in Manhattan, charges Donna Karan Co. with slander, 
breach of contract and fraud. He is seeking more than $60 million in damages. 
</P>
<P>
 Golden's suit differs sharply from the company's complaint as to why he was 
fired after less than a month on the job. 
</P>
<P>
 While his former employer accused him of preparing a shoddy financial plan 
that led Donna Karan Co.'s lenders to place the New York-based company in 
technical default under its revolving credit line, Golden portrayed himself as 
demanding full disclosure of the fashion design company's financial troubles to 
its creditors. 
</P>
<P>
 Golden's lawsuit makes no mention of the company's allegations that he made 
inappropriate statements with sexual overtones to his female co-workers. 
</P>
<P>
 In the lawsuit, the former CFO alleges that he was fired a few days after a 
meeting in which Donna Karan President Stephen Ruzow said the company had 
overstated its fiscal 1993 earnings by understating some expenses by $1 
million.

FORD STICKS WITH ELECTRIC CAR BATTERY DESIGN DESPITE 2 FIRES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Ford Motor Co. said Monday that the sodium sulfur battery remains promising 
for commercial electric cars despite two fires in test vehicles using the 
high-heat propulsion system. 
</P>
<P>
 Ford last week grounded its fleet of 36 Ecostar test vehicles made with the 
sodium sulfur battery pending an investigation into the cause of the fires. 
</P>
<P>
 Some have questioned the safety of using a battery that operates at 600 
degrees Fahrenheit, but a Ford spokeswoman said Monday that the battery has too 
many advantages, such as performance and relatively low cost, to be abandoned. 
"The stakes are too high," Pam Kueber said. 
</P>
<P>
 Auto makers are racing to build a commercially attractive electric car by 
1998, when California will require that 2% of all cars sold in the state be 
zero-emission vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
 All the major car makers have developed electric cars, but each model has 
problems that the makers fear will make them unappealing to the public. 
</P>
<P>
 Kueber said the fire last Friday in an Ecostar in El Monte was similar to one 
a month ago at the Electric Power Research Institute in Palo Alto, but she said 
the second fire disproved an earlier theory that a bad batch of battery cells 
was to blame.

REGIONAL ROUNDUP: HAAS AUTOMATION PLANS TO LEAVE L.A. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Haas Automation Inc., a Chatsworth maker of machine tool parts, said it plans 
to move out of Los Angeles County by late next year. 
</P>
<P>
 The company said it needs room to expand and is considering sites in several 
states, including some in the Midwest, Southwest and Southeast. Sites in 
Ventura County and elsewhere in California are also being considered. 
</P>
<P>
 Haas sales have soared nearly sevenfold over the last six years. Sales were 
$46 million in 1993, compared with $7 million in 1988, said Peter Zierhut, 
sales and marketing manager. Sales this year are expected to approach $100 
million. The company's work force has grown to 211 employees from 46 in 1988, 
said Dennis Dupuis, general manager. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost all the land is being used at the 155,000-square-foot plant Haas leases 
in Chatsworth. The company needs another 100,000 square feet of space to 
increase production and ease a two-month backlog of orders, Dupuis said. The 
company is also frustrated with California state tax laws and worker's 
compensation laws, and with Los Angeles city building fees and codes, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dupuis said all employees will be given the option to move with the firm. Many 
are highly skilled engineers and machinists. Haas pays its workers an average 
wage of about $14 per hour. 
</P>
<P>
 Dupuis said the company has looked at some sites in Los Angeles, but saw none 
suitable. Meanwhile, its offices are inundated by letters and phone calls 
offering free land from states such as Kansas and Texas, which covet the 
skilled engineering jobs Haas provides. 
</P>
<P>
 Haas makes high-tech metal cutting equipment for manufacturers. The company, 
which sells its products internationally, has managed to win back business from 
Japanese firms it competes against. It is also benefiting from a resurgence of 
domestic manufacturing and increased demand in this country for high-tech 
equipment to reduce labor costs, Dupuis said.

REGIONAL ROUNDUP: MARTIN LAWRENCE NEARS FINANCING FROM HERRICK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Martin Lawrence Limited Editions Inc., a Van Nuys-based publisher and 
wholesaler of art, said it has a tentative agreement to receive $3.5 million in 
cash through a private debt and equity financing from the Herrick Co. of Boca 
Raton, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin Lawrence said the financing will allow the recession-battered company 
to enhance and diversify its operations.But the agreement, which must be 
approved by shareholders at the company's September meeting, gives privately 
held Herrick a chance to gain control of Martin Lawrence's board of directors. 
The Herrick company, owned by Norton Herrick, specializes in real estate 
acquisitions.  
</P>
<P>
 As part of the agreement, Martin Blinder, a founder of Martin Lawrence, agreed 
to resign as chairman and chief executive and to remain with Martin Lawrence as 
a consultant to smooth the transition for the new chairman and chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
 The deal calls for Martin Lawrence to sell $2 million principal amount of 
senior secured debt, together with warrants to purchase 250,000 common shares. 
In addition, Martin Lawrence will sell $1.5 million in convertible preferred 
stock to Herrick. The preferred stock is convertible into 3 million common 
shares, plus warrants to buy 4.58 million shares, which if exercised would 
provide Martin Lawrence up to $5.16 million in additional funds.

REGIONAL ROUNDUP: XSIRIUS INC. WINS ANOTHER MARS EXPLORATION CONTRACT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Xsirius Inc., the Camarillo maker of X-ray detection devices, said it has won 
a $250,000 contract from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration to 
build a small X-ray detector to analyze Martian dirt and rock for NASA's 1996 
Pathfinder Mission to Mars. 
</P>
<P>
 It is Xsirius' second contract for for a Mars research device. The company has 
built a similar device for a European Mars probe to be launched from Russia in 
1996. 
</P>
<P>
 The device, called an X-ray fluorescence spectrometer, is about half the size 
of a package of cigarettes and will fit onto the exterior of Pathfinder's 
roving landing craft. The device uses a crystal called mercuric iodide, which 
is manufactured by Xsirius, to reproduce images captured by X-rays.

FOR WORLD CUP ENTREPRENEUR, A BANNER YEAR; ADVERTISING: SIGN MAKER GOLD 
GRAPHICS REBUILDS ITS QUAKE-JOLTED BUSINESS IN TIME TO PUBLICIZE THE 
INTERNATIONAL SOCCER EXTRAVAGANZA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Al Gold's sign business is getting only a small piece of the economic bounty 
that Southern California is expected to collect from the World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 But that piece may have kept his business alive. Gold Graphics Manufacturing 
Co. in Pacoima produces "point-of-purchase" advertising for everything from gas 
stations to banks. 
</P>
<P>
 Late last year, his firm won a contract to supply promotional banners for the 
soccer extravaganza. By the time the first game kicks off June 17, about 50,000 
will festoon light poles in the nine host cities, including Los Angeles. Gold's 
revenue from the World Cup deal could pass $2 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Gold had hardly started work on the project when the Northridge earthquake 
decimated his leased factory, and his equipment damage was not covered by 
insurance. The future of the company he founded in 1951 was at stake. 
</P>
<P>
 Should he wait for federal emergency funds, and risk losing customers in the 
meantime, or do whatever it took to keep the assembly line going? He took the 
second step and leased new quarters a block away -- and financed the move out 
of cash flow from the World Cup banners. 
</P>
<P>
 Gold's potential $2-million project is only a fraction of the estimated $310 
million that the World Cup is expected to generate for the greater Los Angeles 
economy. But, Gold said, "it was a lifeline for us." 
</P>
<P>
 Not only was the company able to recover from the quake, but Gold's regular 
business kept growing, and with the World Cup project he now expects record 
sales this year. And Gold, 66, is also hoping that the World Cup connection 
will go on to raise the profile of his family business, which employs two 
nephews, a son-in-law and a stepson. 
</P>
<P>
 Consumers tend to notice the message of a point-of-purchase display in their 
local store, but not the display itself. At a supermarket there might be a big 
cardboard advertisement standing next to a stack of Coke cans. "Nobody notices 
the display, but they do notice the 99 Coca-Cola six-pack," Gold said. 
</P>
<P>
 The World Cup project is a lot easier for Gold to explain to outsiders. 
"Nobody really knew what I did for a living," Gold said. "They thought I was a 
flag manufacturer for car lots. It's a subliminal company." 
</P>
<P>
 The industry itself is somewhat subliminal -- indeed, point-of-purchase is 
sometimes referred to as "below-the-line" advertising. Some call it the last 
three feet of the sale, a reference to the distance from the display shelf to 
the customer's hand. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite its low profile, point-of-purchase is big business in the United 
States -- worth $15.7 billion in 1992, according to the Point-of-Purchase 
Advertising Institute in Englewood, N.J. Some firms offer specific services, 
such as design or printing, while others, like Gold Graphics, offer full 
service from planning to installation. 
</P>
<P>
 Gold, an avuncular New York native whose office is decorated with his 
collection of antique cameras, made his first signs at home and sold them out 
of his car. His first customer, an auto-polish firm, bought $800 worth. "That 
put me in the black, and I've been there ever since," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 After renting a $90-a-month store on Venice Boulevard, he persuaded his 
identical twin brother, Don, then a lingerie salesman, to join the business. 
They still share ownership of the company, and Don serves as president. 
</P>
<P>
 Their business grew thanks to the big oil companies, including Chevron and 
Unocal, that used Gold Graphics to promote their products at gas stations. At 
one time, the company, which moved to the San Fernando Valley in 1961, had 
branch offices in New York and Houston. 
</P>
<P>
 Then came the energy crisis of the early 1970s, which prompted 
diversification. "I realized we were vulnerable by being so heavily 
concentrated in one industry," Gold said. The firm found new customers in 
automobiles, supermarkets, retail, electronics and financial services. 
</P>
<P>
 Sports events weren't part of the plan. But when the Olympics came to Los 
Angeles in 1984, the designers of the Games' visual packaging -- many of whom 
had worked with Gold Graphics on corporate promotions -- called on Gold's 
expertise. The firm eventually got half the contracts for banners and signs at 
Olympic venues. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was kind of burned out" from the sign business, Gold said. "But the '84 
Olympics rejuvenated me." Gold followed up on the Games' success, for example 
installing banners on city light poles for the last two Super Bowls, in 
Pasadena and Atlanta, and for cultural events at the Music Center and Hollywood 
Bowl. And rather than rely on cities to foot the bill, he persuaded 
corporations to pay from $150 to $250 a pole to sponsor banners celebrating the 
event. 
</P>
<P>
 Customers attribute much of Gold's success to customer service. "He has a 
saying, 'The urgent, you do today, the impossible, you did yesterday,' " said 
Cindy Hearn, Unocal's advertising manager in Brea. "We can always depend on 
him." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1993, Gold, who employs 135 people ranging from computer graphics designers 
to screen printers, had record sales. To cap the year, he got the World Cup 
contract. Gold approached World Cup USA 1994 Chairman Alan Rothenberg with the 
concept of having sponsors for light pole banners. "He thought it was a great 
idea." 
</P>
<P>
 It was the company's largest project to date. Gold put his nephew Andy, 29, in 
charge of coordinating the project. 
</P>
<P>
 And it couldn't have come at a better time. 
</P>
<P>
 That's because the Northridge quake left Gold's 50,000-square-foot factory a 
shambles, the ceiling caved in, banners strewn over the floor and machinery 
broken. He estimates the damage at $1.5 million, including lost equipment and 
inventory. 
</P>
<P>
 The federal Small Business Administration agreed to provide an emergency loan 
of $1.3 million, but Gold could not wait around for the money to come in. 
Within days, he moved operations to a building that the Adray's discount 
electronics chain had recently used as a warehouse. "We didn't have anywhere 
else to go." 
</P>
<P>
 The building needed extensive refurbishing, $300,000 alone for a new 
electrical system. But Gold's staff filled orders, improvising when necessary 
-- they used electric fans to dry banners when there was no gas to fuel drying 
ovens -- and the World Cup cash started rolling in. 
</P>
<P>
 Each city light pole for the World Cup can carry four three-by-eight-foot 
reinforced plastic banners, featuring the sponsor's name below a soccer player 
graphic. Gold would not disclose the exact value of the Cup deal, but sponsors, 
including such companies as Coca-Cola Co., M&M-Mars Inc. and MasterCard, are 
paying around $200 a pole. 
</P>
<P>
 If, as he expects, banners for 12,500 poles are sold, that would yield up to 
$2.5 million in revenues for Gold Graphics. 
</P>
<P>
 Both World Cup organizers and sponsors said the earthquake hardly appeared to 
affect Gold's production. "We were very impressed with the speed with which 
they were able to get back up and running," said Frank Cardenas, director of 
governmental affairs for World Cup USA 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were very quick to assure us that from their end of the operation, it 
would be seamless," said David Casey, events marketing manager for Coca-Cola in 
Los Angeles. "That was very comforting for us." 
</P>
<P>
 As Gold prepared to install the World Cup banners, he faced another hurdle: 
Would the city of Los Angeles charge its standard permit fee of $46 a pole? 
</P>
<P>
 For Los Angeles, the fees could have raised up to $184,000. But for Gold, they 
raised the prospect of sponsors cutting back on the banner program to save 
money. 
</P>
<P>
 None of the other host cities are charging permit fees. After intensive 
lobbying, the City Council voted May 18 to waive the fees. 
</P>
<P>
 Once the World Cup is over, he will be at work producing banners for other 
sporting events, including the 1995 Super Bowl in Miami and the 1996 Olympics 
in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 And while he ultimately plans to hand over the company to the younger family 
members, he has no plans to retire soon. 
</P>
<P>
 Added his nephew Andy: "All the activity that's been going on lately has kind 
of juiced him up."

WALL STREET AWAITING POOL FIRM'S BIG SPLASH; RECREATION: LESLIE'S POOLMART 
HOPES '94 IS THE YEAR THE SPECIALTY SUPPLIES RETAILER WILL LIVE UP TO ANALYSTS' 
EARNINGS EXPECTATIONS. BUT MUCH DEPENDS ON THE WEATHER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICE APODACA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Leslie's Poolmart has had a credibility problem. Blame it on bad weather, 
company executives say. 
</P>
<P>
 Never mind that the nation's largest specialty pool supplies retailer has had 
31 consecutive years of increasing sales; that its profits have grown for each 
of the last four years, and that it stepped up its aggressive growth plan and 
doubled its number of stores since it sold stock to the public in April, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the Chatsworth company has been a disappointment to investors. For two 
years after its initial stock offering at $11 a share, Leslie's didn't meet 
analysts' earnings projections. By mid-1992, its stock had sunk to $5. 
</P>
<P>
 The trouble was, Leslie's Chief Executive Brian McDermott said, the sunny 
analysts' earnings forecasts didn't account for unusually cool weather in much 
of the country during the peak swimming pool season in the summers of 1991 and 
1992. As a result, Leslie's sales and earnings fell about 5% short of what had 
been expected. 
</P>
<P>
 But 1993 was a good year for the company -- with hot, swimming pool weather 
last summer -- so Leslie's profit rose 41% to $3.04 million, while sales grew 
25% to $120 million. And comparable store sales averaged gains of 12% for the 
year. At the end of the year, however, Leslie's stock was at $8.75, still 
underwater from its initial stock offering price. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have achieved the vast majority of what we said we were going to achieve," 
said McDermott. But he now takes care to warn that "things don't always go 
right." 
</P>
<P>
 Could 1994 be the year that Leslie's Poolmart gets some respect on Wall 
Street? 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps. But in a sign that Leslie's continues to swim against waves of 
skepticism, Morgan Keegan & Co. on Wednesday dropped Leslie's from a "focus 
list" that the Memphis investment firm's retail brokers use to make stock 
recommendations. Morgan Keegan took the step because of recent gains in 
Leslie's stock and worries about the company's usual seasonal fluctuations, 
Morgan Keegan analyst Tammira M. Kuntz said. 
</P>
<P>
 That day, Leslie's stock price fell $1 a share. The stock closed Monday at 
$11.25. 
</P>
<P>
 Even analyst Seth Feinstein, at the investment firm Crowell, Weedon & Co. in 
Los Angeles, who said he's "excited" by Leslie's prospects, hasn't recommended 
the company's stock. "If I recommend a purchase, I'm putting my neck on the 
line," he explained, and Leslie's has had "a habit of disappointing Wall 
Street." 
</P>
<P>
 But Feinstein and other analysts remain upbeat about Leslie's and its goal of 
becoming the Home Depot of pool supplies. 
</P>
<P>
 Leslie's has opened 25 new stores this year, bringing the total to 183, and 
plans to add another 40 next year. The stores are spread across the country, 
but about half are in California and Texas. By the end of the decade, it hopes 
to have 500 stores nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 Analyst Kuntz expects Leslie's earnings to jump 52% this year, to $4.6 
million. "There are no other nationwide players" in the pool supply business, 
she said. "The opportunity is huge." 
</P>
<P>
 In the past year, Leslie's has also rejiggered its prices and product mix. The 
stores carry about 3,000 pool-related items, from chlorine -- which accounts 
for one-quarter of sales -- to $1,000 pool heaters and $700 filter systems. 
Leslie's also sells pool covers, life vests, snorkels and toys. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 McDermott said the company has reduced inventory costs by simplifying the way 
products are arranged in stores. Chlorine, for instance, is now centralized in 
one or two locations instead of five. That has allowed Leslie's to introduce 
new products, including popular pool cleaning items and Speedo-brand goggles 
and fins. It is now testing Speedo swimwear in some stores. 
</P>
<P>
 And because Leslie's sees its biggest competition coming from Home Depot and 
other mass merchants, rather than small pool supply shops, it has adopted an 
"everyday low price" strategy. A year ago, it cut prices on certain products by 
an average of about 10%, undercutting even some of the mass merchants and 
warehouse chains. 
</P>
<P>
 The price cuts didn't hurt the company's profit margins much, largely because 
Leslie's buys in bulk, and therefore more cheaply than its rivals. Also, 
Leslie's keeps a lid on its costs by mixing and repackaging chemicals itself, 
and manufacturing some products such as plastic pool covers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We felt sure if we could be the real price leader and make sure our customers 
know that, we could take volume away from everyone else in the industry, 
including the mass merchants," McDermott said. 
</P>
<P>
 Leslie's is also increasing marketing efforts to commercial pool owners, such 
as schools, community centers and hotels. That category accounts for nearly 
one-third of the nation's pools, but only about 8% of Leslie's sales last year. 
</P>
<P>
 A catalogue that Leslie's sends to 3.3 million customers is another source of 
possible growth, McDermott said. Besides trying to boost mail-order sales, 
which produced only 8% of Leslie's sales in 1993, the company is using its 
database to target advertising and pinpoint new store locations. Jim McCloskey, 
editor of the trade magazine Pool & Spa News, said the mailing list gives 
Leslie's the unique advantage when entering new markets of being "recognized as 
a national brand." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the potential for a highly specialized retail chain to have mass-market 
appeal remains unknown, McCloskey said. It's possible that as Leslie's expands 
"they're going to be getting into markets that are less desirable." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 And when a company is aggressively building while cutting prices, missteps can 
be costly, as Leslie's learned last year. A new computer system bungled 
communications between stores and the corporate office, and didn't account for 
sales and inventory properly. Leslie's hired a new chief information officer, 
who worked out the bugs, but not before the company spent an extra $1 million 
tracking store information manually. 
</P>
<P>
 McDermott said he's now devoting his attention to controlling Leslie's fast 
growth. The 37-year-old executive was part of an investor group that acquired 
Leslie's in 1988 for $17.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The sale was the culmination of a feud between Leslie's co-founders, Raymond 
Cesmat and Philip Leslie. Cesmat wanted to sell; Leslie did not. So Cesmat got 
court approval to dissolve Leslie's Poolmart and then sell it, and Phil Leslie 
was ousted. For a few months, the company was in chaos as many employees sided 
with Phil Leslie and refused to work. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually Leslie's recovered. Two years ago, it acquired Sandy's Pool Supply, 
a 20-store North Hollywood chain that was half-owned by Phil Leslie, for about 
$2 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Although McDermott won't rule out more acquisitions, his priority is opening 
new stores, which can be done for a relatively cheap $100,000 apiece. 
</P>
<P>
 And while he pursues his fast-growth plan, McDermott keeps an eye on weather 
reports. He even admitted to consulting the Farmer's Almanac, but said he's 
looking into ways to get more accurate and detailed weather forecasts. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it's the worst weather in 10,000 years, we're not going to hit the numbers 
that are expected of us," he said. But he added, "We will still be an extremely 
profitable company."

REGIONAL EARNINGS: 3D SYSTEMS TURNS PROFIT ON RECORD REVENUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 3D Systems, the Valencia maker of machines that produce small-scale models of 
objects designed on computer screens, reported a profit of $828,561 in the 
first quarter that ended April 1, compared to a loss of $695,212 in the same 
period a year earlier. The turnaround was on a record revenue of $9.47 million, 
up 32% from $7.16 million a year earlier.  
</P>
<P>
 The company attributed the gain to increased sales due to growing acceptance 
of its devices, which manufacture plastic casts of designs so that engineers 
can get a three-dimensional representation of their ideas.

REGIONAL EARNINGS: SEMTECH CORP. REPORTS PROFIT OF $150,000 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Semtech Corp., a Newbury Park maker of semiconductors and other electronic 
components, reported a profit of $150,000 for its fiscal first quarter, 
rebounding from a loss of $210,000 in the same period a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 In the quarter ending May 31, Semtech said revenue climbed 12%, to $5.65 
million from $5.05 million a year earlier. Semtech attributed the stronger 
results partly to lower manufacturing costs. The company said it received $6 
million of new orders in the latest quarter, up 5% from a year earlier, but 
orders for military and aerospace products declined.

SPECIAL DEVICES REPORTS PROFIT OF $755,000 IN 2ND QUARTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Special Devices Inc., a Newhall-based manufacturer of pyrotechnic devices for 
the automotive and aerospace industries, said its fiscal second-quarter profit 
more than tripled on an 81% surge in revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 For the three months ended May 1, Special Devices posted a profit of $755,000, 
up from $206,000 in the same quarter a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 Revenue increased to $15.3 million, from $8.47 million, because of greater 
shipments of devices that trigger air bags in automobiles. 
</P>
<P>
 The company, which also makes parts that ignite missiles, said automation 
helped boost operating margins and earnings. 
</P>
<P>
 For the six months ended May 1, the company showed a profit of $1.23 million, 
up from earnings of $294,000 a year earlier. Six-month revenue climbed 83%, to 
$27.6 million from $15.1 million.

REGIONAL ROUNDUP: HOSPITAL OPERATOR NU-MED ENDS CHAPTER 11 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nu-Med Inc., an Encino hospital operator, announced it has emerged from 
Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization. 
</P>
<P>
 In its new form outlined in the reorganization plan, Nu-Med and its 
subsidiary, PsychGroup Inc., will be run by a new team of officers and 
directors.Heading it will be John V. Koerber, an independent consultant in 
bankruptcy investments, who will act as the company's president and chief 
executive officer. 
</P>
<P>
 The reorganization plan also calls for the repayment of the company's Chapter 
11 administrative claims to be secured by liens on certain assets, including 
the cash and common stock of PsychGroup that would otherwise be distributable 
under the reorganization plan. As a result, no shares of stock or cash will be 
distributed until those claims have been paid down to certain levels.

REGIONAL ROUNDUP: FORTUNE PETROLEUM MAY SELL CALIFORNIA PROPERTIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fortune Petroleum Corp., an Agoura Hills oil and gas exploration and 
production firm, said it is considering selling its California properties so it 
can focus on its assets in Texas and the mid-continent. 
</P>
<P>
 The company once derived 80% of its revenue from California oil production but 
in recent years has shifted strategy and acquired properties in Texas to lessen 
its dependence on oil prices, which fell sharply last year.Fortune Petroleum 
now expects about 75% of its revenue to come from the more profitable natural 
gas production in Texas. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortune Petroleum said that it has not received any offers to purchase its 
California interests and that no final decision has been made to sell the 
properties. However, the company said it has discussed a possible transaction 
with several interested parties. The company said any such sale would require 
the consent of Fortune Petroleum's principal lender, Bank One of Texas.

VENTURA COUNTY REVIEW: AUTO DEALERS REPORTING 10% TO 40% RISE IN SALES FOR 1994 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jack Searles 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In yet another indication that Ventura County is climbing out of the 
recession, auto dealers throughout the county report a strong sales comeback in 
the first five months of 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 Dealers say their business is up 10% to 40% from the same period a year ago, 
when many showrooms were empty much of the time. The improvement comes along 
with gains in employment and home sales reported in recent months. 
</P>
<P>
 At Kirby Oldsmobile/Jeep/Eagle/Suzuki in Ventura, for instance, demand for the 
Jeep Cherokee utility vehicle has been so strong that customers wanting special 
options must wait more than a month for delivery, according to sales manager 
Matt Kelleher. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the hottest line we have," he said. "We'll receive 60 Cherokees and 
Grand Cherokees from the factory this month, and we expect to sell every one of 
them." 
</P>
<P>
 Buyers wanting special colors or other options are having to wait an average 
of 38 days for delivery from Chrysler, which makes the Cherokee, Kelleher said. 
The vehicle ranges in price from $15,500 to $32,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, through May sales at the Kirby dealership have increased at least 10% 
over the first five months of last year, Kelleher noted, "and we're sure we're 
going to maintain the pace." 
</P>
<P>
 At Nesen Motor Car Co. in Thousand Oaks, sales are up 20% thus far this year 
-- and the dealership said it's been successful in marketing its newest line, 
Rolls-Royce. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've already sold five Rolls since we started carrying them a month or so 
ago," said Gary Nesen, Nesen Motor's chief executive. He said three Rolls 
Silver Spurs, costing about $198,000 each, have already been delivered, while 
two other Rolls are on order. He added that the buyers are all "movie people or 
entrepreneurs." 
</P>
<P>
 Sales of Nesen Motor's other nameplates, including Cadillac, Oldsmobile, Lexus 
and Infiniti are all ahead of last year, Nesen said. "The economy has turned. 
We're looking forward to an excellent summer." 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Fisher, general sales manager at Paradise Chevrolet in Ventura, said 
business has improved every month thus far this year. "We sold about 200 new 
and used cars last month," he said. "That's about equal to our pace in 1986, 
which was a good year." 
</P>
<P>
 Fisher added: "There's definitely been a change in people's attitudes. They 
realize some companies around here have closed down, but they've decided to get 
on with their lives."

 Shay Rowe, general sales manager at Pacific Coast Nissan in Oxnard, said sales 
are up 40% over the first five months of last year. "Compared to a couple of 
years ago, when we took over this dealership, business is absolutely 
fantastic," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 At Simi Valley Honda & Acura, business in the first five months of the year 
was up 10% to 15% over the same period in 1993, reported sales manager Kevin 
Steng. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our bread-and-butter cars, the Honda Civic and Accord, are both doing well," 
he said. He notes, however, that some Acura models, priced at about $45,000, 
aren't attracting a great deal of buyer interest right now.

VENTURA COUNTY REVIEW: SEMICONDUCTORS HELP KEEP TRACK OF CROPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 There's something different this year about the hundreds of workers harvesting 
strawberries at the Bob Jones Ranch in northeast Oxnard. They're all carrying 
compact semiconductors. 
</P>
<P>
 The dime-sized "memory buttons," attached to each worker's ID card, keep track 
of how many boxes each employee fills, how much the worker has earned, even 
which fields are producing the best yields. 
</P>
<P>
 Every time a worker brings in a filled box, an employee called a "puncher" 
aims a wand-like computer probe at the worker's memory button. "You hear a beep 
and the information is recorded," says Jones administrative accountant Ann 
Woods. 
</P>
<P>
 The system is saving time and money at the 250-acre strawberry ranch, which 
employed 700 pickers at the peak of the harvest season last month. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been able to reduce our costs by combining the punchers' duties with 
several others," Woods said. "And we now need fewer clerical workers." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, she said, field supervisors are now able to go home earlier 
because they no longer have to tabulate each worker's cards at the end of the 
day. "And instead of storing thousands of cards in huge boxes as we had to do 
before, we now keep our labor records in a couple of computer disks." 
</P>
<P>
 Woods said the Jones Ranch has invested about $12,000 in the system. "We've 
already saved at least that much this year, and from now on we'll save even 
more because we won't have the start-up cost." 
</P>
<P>
 She said she has heard that at least one other Ventura County farm operation 
is using memory buttons. The buttons are made by Dallas Semiconductor Corp. of 
Dallas, Tex., and were customized for agriculture by Agricultural Data Systems 
of Laguna Niguel.

VENTURA COUNTY REVIEW: RED ONION TO REOPEN IN THOUSAND OAKS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A Westlake Village entrepreneur says he's purchased the Red Onion name in 
bankruptcy court and will reopen the defunct chain's Thousand Oaks 
nightclub-restaurant Friday.  
</P>
<P>
 The unit closed last year along with other Red Onion restaurants throughout 
the greater Los Angeles area.The chain was operated by International Onion 
Inc., a West Covina firm that filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 
late 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Preston, who also heads a satellite television network, said he has 
invested "in the six figures" to renovate the Red Onion on Hillcrest Drive. 
"I've lived in the Conejo Valley for 18 years and have an idea of the kind of 
place residents will enjoy," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Under its former owners, the Thousand Oaks Red Onion drew repeated complaints 
from neighbors and police for alleged fistfights, noise and underage drinking.

YOUNG PEOPLE FINDING SUMMER WORK SCARCE; TEEN-AGERS AND THOSE IN THEIR EARLY 
20S STRUGGLE TO LAND THE FEW LOW-SKILL, LOW-PAYING JOBS THAT ARE OUT THERE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Martin Toumaian will make popcorn. Sara Gregory will teach swimming. And Amy 
Means will hurtle through the air upside down.  
</P>
<P>
 All three are taking part in an annual American ritual, the summer job. 
Toumaian, 18, Gregory, 16, and Means, 20, are among thousands of young people 
now exiting schools and entering a panoply of low-skill, low-paying jobs, of 
which working in movie theaters, teaching swimming and testing roller coasters 
are just a few examples. 
</P>
<P>
 They are the lucky ones. At least they found a summer job. Toumaian works at 
Pacific Theatres' Northridge movie complex. Gregory works at the East Valley 
YMCA in North Hollywood, and Means is a ride foreman at Six Flags Magic 
Mountain theme park in Valencia. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite signs of economic recovery in the San Fernando Valley area, other 
young people will have a tough time finding summer work. Youth unemployment, 
always two to three times the overall unemployment rate, is close to a 
five-year high. 
</P>
<P>
 In California, the unemployment rate for workers 16 to 19 years old was 24% in 
April, and it usually goes up another 3% to 5% in summer. And earthquake damage 
has temporarily shut down the Northridge Fashion Center mall, wiping out about 
2,500 jobs, according to Lloyd Miller, mall general manager. Many of those jobs 
were retail posts traditionally held by younger workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Many young people who do land jobs will find them at summer camps, 
restaurants, retail stores, day-care centers, swimming pools and amusement 
parks. At Six Flags Magic Mountain and Universal Studios Hollywood, seasonal 
hiring is already well under way. Both theme parks will add about the same 
number of summer workers this year as last -- about 2,000 at Universal Studios 
and 1,600 at Magic Mountain.  
</P>
<P>
 The vast majority of these workers will be under 24 years old and will earn 
between $5 and $7 per hour. Sharonda Picquet, 22, a Palmdale resident who is a 
College of the Canyons student, is working as a waitress at Mooseburger Lodge 
restaurant at Magic Mountain this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Picquet, who hopes to become a lawyer, said her Magic Mountain job is marred 
by that common hazard of summer work -- an embarrassing uniform. Despite having 
to dress like a Boy Scout, she said it's a vast improvement over her previous 
summer job at a motocross racetrack snack bar. 
</P>
<P>
 Co-worker Josh Seat, 23, of Valencia, a graduate student at the California 
Institute of the Arts in Valencia, will earn $7 an hour as a "greeter," who 
welcomes customers at the Magic Mountain restaurant and sings to them with the 
restaurant staff several times a day. The money he earns this summer will help 
him offset a 75% cutback in his scholarship funds, which have been curtailed as 
a result of the earthquake, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Seat hopes to become a filmmaker, and he needs money to complete a film he has 
produced -- a thriller set in the Magic Mountain area. "There are not a lot of 
jobs that would keep my interest," said Seat. "I thought this one would." 
</P>
<P>
 For many who do find a summer job, using it to make a dent in college costs is 
getting harder. The U. S. Census Bureau says that median income for 15- to 
24-year-olds has basically stayed flat in the past decade when adjusted for 
inflation. At the same time, the cost of attending college has soared. Tuition 
and fees for a semester at Cal State Northridge, for example, has more than 
doubled in the past decade when adjusted for inflation. And tuition at CSUN 
will go up another 10% next fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Students who want to work their way through college must be as driven as 
22-year-old Monica Johnson, a senior at UCLA who wants to be a psychiatrist. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 During school, Johnson works three jobs, doing lab work, dorm management and 
campus vending. Johnson recently auditioned for a summer job as a Universal 
Studios tour guide. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson spent a long morning auditioning in a sweltering hotel meeting room 
with dozens of other would-be tour guides last month. Failure of the 
air-conditioning system added to the discomfort of these job seekers, who were 
asked to give impromptu speeches before a roomful of rival applicants. "I have 
to keep working my other jobs, and I thought this one would give me more fun," 
said Johnson. She didn't get that tour guide job, but she is still being 
considered for other positions at Universal Studios. 
</P>
<P>
 The competition for just about any summer job is fierce. 
</P>
<P>
 Harold Gordon, senior director of Camp Kinneret Day Camp and Sunny Skies Day 
Camp in Agoura Hills, said he is getting 10 applicants for each of 100 camp 
counseling and other camp staff jobs he adds each summer. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Career Center at Cal State Northridge, only about local 30 employers, 
down from 60 last year, turned out for the college's yearly summer job fair 
this spring, said Ann Morey, CSUN career counselor. Morey blames the low 
turnout on the earthquake and the closure of the Northridge Fashion Center, 
which won't reopen until late this year at the earliest. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 One employer of youths from poorer families is the federally funded Summer 
Youth Employment and Training Program, which each summer hires people ages 14 
to 21 for a variety of low-level jobs in local government or for nonprofit 
agencies. The federal program pays $5.47 an hour. The program starts in July 
and will employ about 15,000 people through the city of Los Angeles, and 
another 8,000 through the Los Angeles County Private Industry Council. 
</P>
<P>
 But each year, the program is overwhelmed with applicants, said George Flores, 
program manager of youth programs for the county. Typically, more than twice as 
many young people apply as there are spaces in the program. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the program's popularity, there is a growing feeling that a summer job 
is not as valuable as it once was. Studies have shown that, in the case of the 
federal summer jobs program, summer work alone does little to improve a young 
person's chances of staying employed later in life, said Tom Smith, vice 
president of Public/Private Ventures in Philadelphia, a nonprofit agency that 
has studied youth employment. 
</P>
<P>
 So last year, Congress retooled the federal program to shift the emphasis away 
from traditional summer work and give more weight to education. For the first 
time in Los Angeles this summer, program participants who test below grade 
levels in certain skills must attend school two hours per day in addition to 
their outside jobs. They will get paid for both, said Earl Jones of the city's 
Department of Community Development. 
</P>
<P>
 Not all the summer jobs news is grim. There are strong indications that the 
Valley's economy is rebounding, and that can mean a growth in temporary jobs, 
which is good news for college-age workers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of the very best temporaries are students. . . . Employers need 
multi-skilled people, and it's the young who are multi-skilled," said Iris 
Bogard, president of Bogard Temps Inc. of Encino, which provides office help. 
During the summer, about 20% of her temporary workers are students on break 
from college. Bogard said her company's sales grew to $2.7 million in 1993 from 
$1.6 million the year before, and she expects to do even better this year.  
</P>
<P>
 Jon Speier, 21, of Woodland Hills is returning to work for Bogard Temps again 
this summer. Speier worked in customer service, bill collections, and fraud 
investigations for a cellular phone company, and it wants him back. Speier, a 
student and sprinter on the track team at Azusa Pacific University, said he 
earns money from a summer job so that he doesn't have to work while in school 
and can instead focus on running. 
</P>
<P>
 Internships may also be a bright spot in this summer's job market. Mary 
Williams, a CSUN counselor, said the stronger economy nationally means summer 
internships for college students are up this year. The CSUN career center has 
about three times as many companies advertising internships locally and 
elsewhere this year compared with two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite this, students say competition for summer internships is fierce. 
"There are so many students at CSUN and there are not very many jobs," said a 
disconsolate Jeffrey Jones, a 22-year-old accounting major, displaying the 
handful of listings for accounting internships he was jotting down at the 
center. 
</P>
<P>
 As tough as it is for college students to find summer jobs, those of high 
school age have even a tougher time. Summer internships are generally 
restricted to college students, and many temporary services only hire workers 
18 and over. The same is true of security-guard services and some summer camps, 
both heavy users of student labor. 
</P>
<P>
 Erick Dominguez, 16, a serious, soft-spoken Reseda High School student, wants 
to help support his parents and his two siblings. His mother is a housekeeper, 
his father is a sewing machine operator, and they need help making ends meet. 
Erick said he would take any job, if he could just find one. 
</P>
<P>
 He has applied at several fast-food restaurants. "They say they are not 
hiring, or they don't hire you at 16," he said. "I thought it was going to be 
easy to find a job. But it's not easy." 
</P>
<P>
 To help, some public schools are tailoring programs to give high school 
students more skills they need to find jobs. Starting this fall, most Los 
Angeles district high schools will shift a required class to the ninth grade 
from 10th grade that teaches resume writing and various job interview skills to 
help prepare students earlier for work. 
</P>
<P>
 Such changes are welcomed by employers, who complain that that younger people 
are ill-prepared for the workplace. "They don't seem to be getting it," said 
Scott Nostaja, senior vice president of administration at Universal Studios 
Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 Nostaja gets applications where the penmanship is so bad he can't read what 
they have written, and complains that during interviews some job applicants' 
only response is to mumble yes or no. Gary J. Vien , who does much of the 
hiring for Magic Mountain, said some young applicants arrive with bare feet and 
beachwear for interviews. Others bring a gaggle of friends. 
</P>
<P>
 Most young people, though, will find jobs through their own trials and errors, 
like Sara Gregory, the 16-year-old swimming instructor, who attends North 
Hollywood High School, and her friend Marcia Muller, 15. 
</P>
<P>
 The pair cornered jobs as swimming instructors and lifeguards at the East 
Valley YMCA in North Hollywood earning about $5.50 per hour, an achievement 
they owe to strong arms, and a lifeguard certificate earned by both this 
spring. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither take their good fortune for granted, though. "All my friends (say), 
'Oh my God, you are so lucky to have a job,' " said Gregory.

EMPLOYERS OFFER TIPS FOR JOB APPLICANTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JILL LEOVY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Employers have a lot to say about summer job applicants, and much of it isn't 
good. If you want to get hired, don't show up chewing gum or wearing 
inappropriate clothing, and fill out your application legibly. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't take much to stand out against the rest," said Gary J. Vien, 
director of administration at Six Flags Magic Mountain in Valencia, adding that 
teen-agers sometimes come barefoot to his office. 
</P>
<P>
 Valley employers offer this advice: 
</P>
<P>
 Don't call and ask if any jobs are open. Instead, go in person and ask during 
business hours. If the firm advertised a specific time to accept applications, 
go near the beginning, not the end of that period. And go alone. Employers said 
they can't stand young applicants who come to apply for a job with a friend or 
relative in tow. 
</P>
<P>
 Wear proper clothes. Sandals and baggy pants are out. So are water bottles and 
chewing gum. Most employers say they expect applicants to dress as they would 
on the job, and several said they are impressed by a tie and jacket. If in 
doubt, ask beforehand what sort of attire is expected, said Harold Gordon, 
senior director at Camp Kinneret Day Camp and Sunny Skies Day Camp in Agoura 
Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the interview, be on time. Don't answer questions with a simple yes or 
no. Employers want you to talk. "I don't want to have to probe for answers," 
said Loren Farell, owner of Regal Cleaners in Tarzana. "Employers want to see 
interaction, eye contact. They want you to smile," added Vien. 
</P>
<P>
 If at the close of the interview the employer asks if you have something to 
add, ask a question or make a comment. Chances are, the employer is simply 
trying to draw you out. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't ask the employer early in the interview about pay or days off. Many 
employers say they are turned off by applicants who seem too eager to cut to 
questions about money and benefits. After the interview send a thank-you note. 
So few young applicants do so that those who do give themselves an instant 
edge. 
</P>
<P>
 For many entry-level jobs, employers have their own application forms and a 
resume isn't necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 But if you want a resume, the most important thing to include is any 
experience that might relate to job skills, even for applicants who have never 
worked before. "Many times people have experience and they don't realize it," 
said Ann Morey, Cal State Northridge career counselor. "Even baby-sitting, you 
learn people skills and supervisory skills." 
</P>
<P>
 List any school activities, such as organizing a school store, or any courses 
that may have required special skills. Employers also often look for computer 
experience, communication skills or foreign language ability. JILL LEOVY

CRUTTENDEN HIT WITH $4.5-MILLION ACTION; SECURITIES: FORMER MANAGER SAYS O.C. 
BROKERAGE FIRED HIM FOR REFUSING TO BREAK TRADING RULES. FIRM'S FOUNDER DENIES 
CHARGE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The former head of retail sales for Orange County's largest brokerage filed a 
$4.5-million complaint Monday against Cruttenden & Co. alleging that he was 
fired for refusing to violate securities rules, his lawyer said. 
</P>
<P>
 The complaint, filed by Bradley C. Weddon with the National Assn. of 
Securities Dealers, alleges that company founder Walter W. Cruttenden III 
knowingly sold low-quality stocks in order to generate large fees on private 
stock offerings, many for small Orange County companies, said Gary L. Gebler, 
Weddon's attorney.  
</P>
<P>
 Walter Cruttenden, reached Monday at the brokerage's Irvine headquarters, 
denied all of the allegations in the complaint and characterized Weddon, who 
left the firm in February, as a disgruntled former employee. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole thing is ridiculous. He was fired for cause," Cruttenden said. He 
said he did not want to "get into the causes" of Weddon's departure but said 
the company has "excellent documentation." 
</P>
<P>
 "When people do bad things around here, we fire them, just like we fired 
Brad," he said. He would not elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
 The NASD complaint alleges that Weddon, who was hired in August, 1990, was 
fired earlier this year because he "refused to participate in and tolerate the 
flagrant violation of NASD and SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission) 
regulations by Cruttenden management. Cruttenden's solution, a retaliatory 
termination of the potential 'whistle-blower,' clearly constitutes wrongful 
termination," the arbitration action states. 
</P>
<P>
 The complaint asks for $500,000 to compensate for lost wages and $4 million in 
punitive damages. 
</P>
<P>
 "I brought my concerns about the activity up to management, and they didn't 
seem to care," Weddon said in an interview Monday. "There was never any 
indication of them being unhappy with my performance." 
</P>
<P>
 The arbitration action states that, under Weddon's direction, the brokerage's 
retail business doubled from $3 million for 1992 to $6 million for the 
following year. 
</P>
<P>
 The eight-page complaint also alleges that, when the firm handled the initial 
public stock offering in 1992 for Wilshire Technologies, a Carlsbad company, it 
"elected to disregard and bury negative information relating to the security," 
including earnings statements, which resulted in "substantial monetary losses 
to public customers who bought based on Cruttenden's knowing misrepresentation 
of the company." 
</P>
<P>
 Further, the complaint alleges that founder Cruttenden, compliance officer 
Dennis Holtorf and others maintained an account to keep up with losses or gains 
from unauthorized trades in client accounts. 
</P>
<P>
 The document also alleges that Weddon made "continued complaints about such 
conduct at the manager's meeting prior to his termination." 
</P>
<P>
 Walter Cruttenden denied that Monday and said of Weddon: "If he did know about 
those things, why didn't he say anything in the last three years?" 
</P>
<P>
 Once the complaint is received by the NASD, the agency will assign a hearing 
date to resolve the dispute.

BRIEFCASE: TECHNOLOGY; PARAGON BEGINS FIBER-OPTIC SERVICE TO 2,000 CUSTOMERS IN 
HUNTINGTON BEACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Compiled by Dean Takahashi, Times staff writer

<TEXT>
<P>
 Paragon Cable, the Garden Grove cable-TV provider, said that beginning today, 
2,000 of its customers will receive service via fiber-optic cable. 
</P>
<P>
 Paragon said the company broke ground in March on the system and expects to 
continue on the $17-million project through 1994, hooking up about 30,000 homes 
by year's end. 
</P>
<P>
 The neighborhood in Huntington Beach is bordered by Magnolia Street on the 
west, Brookhurst Street on the east, Pacific Coast Highway on the south and a 
neighborhood south of Adams Street on the north. 
</P>
<P>
 By laying fiber-optic cable, which is made up of thin strands of glass that 
can transmit laser signals at the speed of light, the company will be able to 
pipe a much wider volume of TV signals to the area. 
</P>
<P>
 The benefit for subscribers will be an immediate increase in the number of 
channels offered from 45 to 80. New channels will include C-Span I and C-Span 
II, ESPN2, KHSC 46, an electronic program guide, TV Food Network, KRCA 62, NASA 
select, International Channel, Leased Access, QVC, Cal-Span and First Choice 
IV. Nine other channels are reserved for future use. New channels to be offered 
for a monthly fee include The Learning Channel, the Sci Fi Channel, Flix, Bravo 
and E!. 
</P>
<P>
 Reception quality should also be better, the company said, for the laser 
pulses can travel farther without distortion than signals that passed through 
its older coaxial wire system. 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, the company expects to be able to offer more than 300 channels. 
Paragon has 96,000 subscribers in Garden Grove, Westminster, Stanton, 
Huntington Beach, Fountain Valley, Los Alamitos and Rossmoor.

ASSETS STILL FROZEN IN FIRST PENSION CASE; INVESTMENT: A JUDGE KEEPS INJUNCTION 
IN EFFECT UNTIL FEDERAL FRAUD INVESTIGATION IS CONCLUDED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A federal judge Monday left in place a preliminary injunction filed by the 
Securities and Exchange Commission on May 26 freezing the assets of all three 
principals in failed First Pension Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 At a hearing in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles, Judge Harry Hupp ruled 
that the assets of William E. Cooper, Robert E. Lindley and Valerie Jensen, all 
former prinicpals of the now-defunct Irvine pension management company, will 
remain frozen until a federal investigation is concluded. 
</P>
<P>
 As much as $124 million of 8,000 investors' money may have been lost to fraud 
and outright theft, investigators say. The Securities and Exchange Commission 
alleges that First Pension's owners operated an elaborate pyramid scheme, 
leading clients to invest in mortgages that did not exist.  
</P>
<P>
 The three principals are reportedly in settlement discussion with the SEC, and 
those talks could conclude at any time, said Lisa Gok, assistant regional 
director with the SEC. 
</P>
<P>
 Cooper, Jensen and Lindley recently signed cooperation and plea agreements 
with the U.S. attorney's office and are cooperating with an investigation by 
the FBI.

ORANGE COUNTY BRIEFLY: IVAX DENIES EX-MCGAW CHAIRMAN'S FRAUD CHARGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ivax Corp. denied allegations of securities fraud contained in a lawsuit 
brought by the former chairman of McGaw Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 Ivax, a Miami maker of generic drugs, said Friday that the lawsuit, filed 
Thursday in U.S. District Court in Santa Ana by former McGaw Chairman James M. 
Sweeney, is without merit.Both the corporation and Chairman Phillip Frost were 
named as defendants. 
</P>
<P>
 "We intend to defend the suit vigorously," Ivax's general counsel, Armando A. 
Tabernilla, said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
 Sweeney alleges that Ivax and Frost misrepresented the company's financial 
condition before it acquired McGaw, an Irvine-based maker of medical products, 
in March. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyers for Sweeney, who resigned from McGaw in February, said in a statement 
Tuesday night that Ivax issued false and misleading predictions of the value of 
its best-selling product, a drug called Verapamil. But when the first-quarter 
results were issued, earnings declined compared to the previous three months. 
</P>
<P>
 Ivax's statement quotes Chief Operating Officer Richard C. Pfenniger Jr. as 
saying, "We believe that McGaw's shareholders received excellent value in this 
transaction."

AMERICAN SAVINGS TAKES OVER DEPOSITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 American Savings Bank has acquired $89.2 million in deposits from Encino 
Savings Bank in a sale forced by regulators and reopened the small thrift's two 
offices Monday as American branches. 
</P>
<P>
 American, based in Irvine, said Friday that it will close those branches in 
about two months and move the deposit accounts to nearby American offices.It 
will hire a dozen of the 26 employees and give temporary jobs to three more. 
The rest will join the Resolution Trust Corp., the federal agency charged with 
liquidating failed thrifts. 
</P>
<P>
 American's offer to pay $1.5 million for the right to the deposits was the 
highest of three bids turned in to regulators. 
</P>
<P>
 Encino Savings appeared to be solvent, with $95.8 million in loans and other 
assets and $90.7 million in debts and other liabilities. But regulators said 
many assets were troubled, and the thrift, which lost $2.1 million last year, 
would have failed eventually. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of seizing the thrift earlier, regulators began seeking bids from 
other institutions, then forced the sale. The RTC will liquidate the loans and 
other assets at an estimated cost to taxpayers of $4.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
 With $17.2 billion in loans and other assets, American is the nation's 
fourth-largest thrift.

MEDICAL INSURANCE FOR PETS CAN BE A LIFESAVER; COVERAGE: AN ANAHEIM PROVIDER IS 
NATION'S LARGEST INSURER OF ANIMALS AND HAS ISSUED MORE THAN A HALF-MILLION 
POLICIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If Travis Coates had been able to obtain health insurance for his pet, the boy 
may never have had to pull the trigger on Old Yeller. 
</P>
<P>
 For $10 a month, the lovable hound of Fred Gipson's bittersweet tale would 
have been vaccinated and spared both rabies and his master's rifle. He may, 
however, have howled over a provision for 50% off the cost of neutering. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, pet health insurance did not exist in the book's fictional past. 
And in the real-life present, it is uncommon; only one major multi-state 
carrier provides nationwide coverage, though smaller plans are springing up. 
</P>
<P>
 The nation's largest pet health insurer, Veterinary Pet Insurance in Anaheim, 
has issued more than 500,000 policies in 39 states since it was founded 14 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Premiums average $75 a year. "We cover accidents or illnesses. In that sense, 
it's pretty much the same as regular (human) health insurance," Vice President 
Richard Stephens said. "Elective surgeries, spays, neuters and routine care 
aren't covered." 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Scott Matheson, medical director for the Family Veterinary Hospital's All 
Pet Complex in Taylorsville, Utah, said, "We find that the vast majority of pet 
owners don't really take proper care of their pets. A lot of times, the option 
that people choose is euthanasia. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's frustrating when perhaps 80% of all euthanasias are unnecessary. We 
would rather be able to treat these animals and get them back to their 
families." 
</P>
<P>
 In a country that spent nearly $7 billion on veterinary care for dogs and cats 
in 1991, pet health insurance might seem to be a logical growth industry. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically, we think it's a great idea," said Katherine Brant, spokeswoman for 
the Humane Society of Utah. "Many people deeply devoted to their companion 
animals will quite often put their companion's health care needs ahead of their 
own." 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Family Veterinary Hospital launched a three-tiered dog and cat 
health plan. So far, more than 200 pet owners have signed up, and Matheson 
expects enrollment to reach 400 to 500 by year's end. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's how it works: A $10-a-month plan offers vaccinations, other routine 
treatments and savings on spays and neuters. For $7.50 more, the plan extends 
discounts to medical, surgical, prescription and laboratory services. A 
$25-month payment covers the full cost of medical, surgical and lab work up to 
$500, and half the cost above that. 
</P>
<P>
 Matheson said the prepaid options are more akin to human health maintenance 
organizations (HMOs) than to regular third-party insurance plans, dozens of 
which have failed in the pet-care market in recent decades. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest to go under was the Fireman's Fund Insurance Co.'s Medipet program, 
which quit writing new policies April 4. John Kozero, spokesman for the Novato, 
Calif.-based firm, said fewer than 7,000 pet owners signed up during a 
three-year trial run. 
</P>
<P>
 "An awful lot of people showed interest, but after they received the 
brochures, very few sent in checks," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 There would appear to be plenty of room for small-scale, prevention-oriented 
pet health plans. Indeed, pet insurance has become a hot topic for the American 
Veterinary Medical Assn., which recently appointed an executive panel to 
explore the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody seems to be very interested in this," said spokesman Mike Walters, 
reached at the association's offices in Schaumburg, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
 While not endorsing any insurance scheme, Walters argued that dogs and cats 
are better risks than people. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you consider that a lot of health problems may be the result of voluntary 
or discretionary but unsafe activities -- drinking, smoking, or riding 
motorcycles without helmets -- animals don't engage in those activities," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, the latest year for which the American Veterinary Medical Assn. has 
statistics, Americans owned 52.5 million dogs and 57 million cats. Nearly $4.6 
billion was spent on canine veterinary care, while cat owners paid more than 
$2.3 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Bills for veterinary care, while nowhere near as high as medical bills for 
humans, can still be budget-breakers. 
</P>
<P>
 "A real common example is a dog or cat that gets hit by a car. If it has a 
single broken bone, it would not be uncommon to have surgery, and that's $800 
to $1,000," Matheson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rev. Bradley Wirth considers the coverage he bought for Oliver Wendell 
Wirth -- a 15-year-old "terrier-poodle-cocker and, we've always said, 
Presbyterian" -- to have been almost providential. 
</P>
<P>
 The All Saints Episcopal Church priest, concerned by Oliver's difficulty 
navigating steps, took the dog in for X-rays at All Pet. Two large bladder 
stones were discovered, requiring surgery last January. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of the $930 the operation cost, Wirth paid $176 to return Oliver to 
health. 
</P>
<P>
 "In my role as a priest, I have seen people agonize over medical procedures 
for their pets. It was an absolute godsend for us, and I think it would be for 
other folks."

PACIFIC RIM TRADE; ASIAN DYNAMISM FILLS AN OCEAN OF COMMERCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES GERSTENZANG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 They steam out of West Coast ports every day, an average of 26 ships carrying 
3,000 tons of cargo each, from tiny computer chips to gigantic earthmovers for 
buyers in China, Japan and other nations of the vast East Asian market. 
</P>
<P>
 On their return trips to America, the ships are laden with 5,000 tons each of 
cheap Chinese clothing, top-of-the-line Japanese computers and a bounty of 
consumer goods in between. The imbalance in tonnage reflects the stubborn U.S. 
trade deficit with Asia. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pacific Ocean and the sky above it have become the modern equivalent of 
the storied Silk Road, the overland route from the Orient to Europe that 
carried East-West trade in ancient times. As early as the 2nd Century BC, 
Romans were wearing garments made of Chinese silk, and the Chinese were burning 
oil in lamps imported from Rome. Camels carried the freight. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the routes of commerce are infinitely more complex. "When traced on a map, 
a vast network of air and ocean shipping routes, supported by threadlike 
communication links, forms a cat's cradle of Pacific Basin interconnections," 
says Mark Borthwick, American executive director of the Pacific Economic 
Cooperation Council, a 21-nation organization based in Singapore. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S.-Japan link is the principal transpacific route, but just one of many. 
Of every $10 worth of U.S. trade with the Orient, Japan accounts for $4. China, 
looming as an economic giant, now accounts for $1 in every $10 of U.S.-Asian 
commerce, and its trade with the United States has doubled in just three years. 
Taiwan, South Korea, Singapore and Hong Kong are not far behind. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's easier to think about the United States and Japan, rather than an 
extremely complex matrix in which it is important to think about three-way, 
four-way and five-way trade," Borthwick notes. 
</P>
<P>
 While trade between the United States and East Asia is growing rapidly, trade 
among East Asian nations is growing faster still. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1993, the value of international trade within East Asia surpassed that 
between East Asia and the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Coal from New Zealand is shipped to Taiwan, where it fuels a furnace that 
turns out sheets of automotive steel. The steel is purchased by the Nissan 
Motor Co. and sent to Japan or, perhaps, Thailand, Malaysia or the Philippines. 
There, it is pressed into the shape of a station wagon, the AD Resort, in 
production in each of the four countries, with parts made throughout the 
region. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are a country with global interests," says Jeffrey E. Garten, U.S. 
undersecretary of commerce for international affairs. "Power and wealth are 
shifting to the Pacific, and we want to participate in that growth. This is 
another frontier for the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "American commerce once looked to the taming of the West and the development 
of cities up and down the Pacific Coast as the growth story. They are now 
turning to the countries of Asia in the late 20th Century. The benefits will be 
measured in a more vibrant U.S. economy." America's Role  
</P>
<P>
 Such involvement gives the United States a role in Asia based on more than the 
presence of its military, he said. In effect, economic ties become a common 
thread, along with shared values and political goals, weaving individual 
countries into a community of nations. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton last month left no doubt about how much U.S. economic links 
to East Asia mean to him. Reversing the position he advocated during the 
election campaign and his first year in office, Clinton renewed China's 
privileged trading status with the United States despite Beijing's continuing 
record of what he called "very serious human rights abuses." 
</P>
<P>
 Now that Washington is no longer bound to Asia by a strategic relationship 
built on containment of the Soviet Union, it must compete for influence along 
the Pacific Rim on the basis of economic power. And it must face the prospects 
of greater friction, not just between itself and Japan but between Japan and 
Asian nations no longer willing to be Japan's economic puppets. 
</P>
<P>
 Entrepreneurial spirit is blossoming in East Asia: in Malaysia, whose trade 
with the United States has nearly doubled in three years; in China, which is 
systematically unshackling markets that had been hamstrung by communism; even 
in Vietnam, which is establishing initial diplomatic links with Washington two 
decades after the American military withdrew from its disastrous involvement 
there. 
</P>
<P>
 It is an atmosphere in which the titans of Asian industry flourish. 
</P>
<P>
 Kim Woo Choong has built South Korea's Daewoo industrial conglomerate into a 
world-class colossus. Taiwan's Y.F. Chang began his working life as an 
apprentice sailor and now owns one of the world's largest container shipping 
fleets. From his base in Hong Kong, Li Ka-shing (net worth: $3.5 billion) 
controls an industrial empire whose tentacles extend to Europe and North 
America. Changing Patterns  
</P>
<P>
 Beyond merely generating wealth, they are influencing the political and social 
development of their region, sometimes in surprising ways: 
</P>
<P>
 * Even as increasing contact between the United States and Asia opens the door 
to a greater awareness of each others' cultures, economic independence is 
leading to a political confidence that allows Asian countries, many of them 
former colonial territories, to stand up to Western pressures. So the onetime 
British colony of Singapore can ignore, without apology, U.S. government 
protests over the caning of a young American offender. 
</P>
<P>
 * The traditional pattern of trade that moved mostly on an east-west axis is 
shifting. Transpacific commerce is huge and growing, but north-south routes are 
developing rapidly, with products and parts moving throughout East Asia and the 
United States playing little or no role in much of the process. 
</P>
<P>
 * But the need for highways, for bridges, for sophisticated communications 
networks -- those developments known as infrastructure -- that will allow the 
easier transport of goods and ideas in Asia presents a huge opportunity for 
U.S. firms. Bechtel International and Motorola have found a profitable market 
in this field, establishing a base that could pay off for years to come. 
Similarly, Boeing is busily supplying the region with new airplanes, and with 
them a toehold for parts and maintenance work in years ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 "The location of the telegraph lines and railroads influenced the patterns of 
communication, the economic flows and how integration took place" in the 
American West of the 19th Century, Robert B. Zoellick, undersecretary of state 
for economic affairs in the George Bush Administration, said in a speech last 
fall. 
</P>
<P>
 "Today, in the Pacific, we are determining where the airline routes go, what 
telecommunication systems we will use, what languages people will speak, where 
students will study and many other questions that will set patterns of future 
interaction. It is in the interests of America and of Asia that the U.S. turn 
out to be a key part of this 'infrastructure.' " 
</P>
<P>
 * While low-skilled, poorly paid Asian workers are still turning out running 
shoes, plastic toys and inexpensive clothing, the notion that Asia offers 
little more than raw materials, a cheap production platform and factories 
spewing cars and televisions and VCRs is more than a decade out of date. Now it 
is home to stock markets, computer companies and heavy industry employing 
educated and motivated workers -- in short, a complete economic food chain. 
</P>
<P>
 "In many circumstances, companies went to Asia to take advantage of low wages. 
Now, they stay there, and more companies come in, to take advantage of very 
talented, highly educated, knowledgeable workers, scientists, design engineers, 
for the up-market production," said Robert Hormats, vice chairman of the 
investment firm of Goldman, Sachs International. Technical Edge  
</P>
<P>
 Singapore is producing approximately half of the world's computer disk drives. 
Malaysia is the world's third-largest producer of semiconductors. Indonesia, 
which 12 years ago depended on oil sales for 80% of its export earnings, now 
has a diversified manufacturing economy, with oil representing only one-third 
of its exports. 
</P>
<P>
 "Contrary to conventional wisdom, you are looking at countries that are 
seeking to get at the cutting edge of technology. They are no longer the Nike 
shoe boys," said William T. Archey, former international vice president of the 
U.S. Chamber of Commerce, who is teaching a graduate course in global trade 
relations at George Mason University in northern Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
 A massive middle class is emerging: educated workers commanding higher 
salaries that, in turn, can raise living standards and create a consumer market 
for U.S. farmers to feed. Not even counting Japan, "there will be some 75 
million households in Asia with incomes comparable to those earned by 
middle-income Americans" within six years, U.S. Treasury Secretary Lloyd 
Bentsen said recently. 
</P>
<P>
 The evidence was readily apparent to Bentsen during a recent tour of the 
region: skyscrapers sprouting from the sprawling landscape of Shanghai; 
satellite dishes perched on Beijing rooftops; vertical shopping malls beckoning 
shoppers in Indonesia. Problems Persist  
</P>
<P>
 But this is no utopia. There are also great social and economic disparities 
that make some corners of Asia unattractive at many levels: the seamy world of 
the Bangkok sex shops, the polluted skyline of Jakarta and the often 
authoritarian political regimes that predominate even as democracy gains a 
foothold. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's growth without development" contends James Fallows, author of "Looking 
at the Sun," a study of Asian capitalism and the challenge it poses to the 
United States. "The question is whether they will develop a capacity for 
sustained development." 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, politically, Asia's economic development is exposing a region 
with a tradition of authoritarian government to the values of Western political 
thought. 
</P>
<P>
 "The economic integration has political overtones," said Zoellick, the former 
Bush Administration official. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you have economic liberty, it tends to be associated with political 
liberty. It tends to be associated with the development of a middle class. This 
roughly shared value system is a form of security. People will tend to have 
similar views of issues if they share political systems."

 With the advent of satellites and faxes, computers and modems, and the 
increased contact accompanying increased trade, "it is impossible for 
governments to control thinking," said Garten, the Commerce Department 
undersecretary. "This makes the relationship between trade and politics 
quantitatively different from anything we have known."

PACIFIC RIM TRADE; JAPAN; TRADING COMPANIES POWER TOKYO'S ECONOMIC EXPANSION; 
WITH THEIR VAST NETWORKS OF EMPLOYEES AND CONTACTS, SOGO SHOSHA FIND BUSINESS 
FOR OTHER COUNTRIES AS WELL.

<P>
 Every day 100,000 messages -- all delivered within five minutes -- flow 
through a single telecommunications network here that handles transactions 
worth $147 billion, an amount larger than the gross national product of 
Denmark. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet this is not a national system. It is the network of a single company -- 
Mitsui & Co. -- linking 11,000 employees in more than 200 offices in 88 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the sogo shosha (integrated trading company), an institution that 
helped nurture this country into the world's leading trader -- as measured by 
surpluses -- and promises to lead it into an even broader role in international 
business. 
</P>
<P>
 "From 1950 to 1970, with exports as the core, Japan grew by more than 10% a 
year. It was able to do this because of the trading companies. Every three 
years, they found a new product to drive exports -- bicycles, motorcycles, 
cameras, radios, television, steel, cars. Manufacturers couldn't have done it 
alone," said Eimei Yamashita, a former vice minister of the Ministry of 
International Trade and Industry (MITI) and a retired Mitsui executive. 
</P>
<P>
 Trading companies are not unique to Japan. Jardine Matheson of Hong Kong is a 
trading company. South Korea mimicked Japan to establish trading companies for 
each of its chaebol (conglomerates). Even the United States, under Presidents 
Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan, attempted to create trading companies. 
</P>
<P>
 But none of the non-Japanese firms ever achieved the size of the shosha . 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Blanketing the globe, each of them buys and sells as many as 30,000 products 
-- so many that top executives have trouble keeping track of what's going on at 
their own companies. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitsui, for example, formerly divided its operations into product-line 
divisions. "But when the number of divisions reached 80, it became apparent we 
were losing sight of the overall picture," company President Naohiko Kumagai 
told the newspaper Asahi. The divisions were reorganized into 20 headquarters 
"to broaden horizontal contacts," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although 19 firms belong to the Japan Foreign Trade Council, five behemoths 
and four giants attract most of the attention. Their combined fiscal 1993 sales 
-- excluding their subsidiaries -- amounted to $957 billion, or more than a 
quarter of Japan's GNP. 
</P>
<P>
 Beginning around 1970, Japan's major manufacturers started selling their own 
products overseas, but the Big Nine trading companies still handle 65% of 
Japan's imports and 37% of its exports. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, trading to and from Japan accounts for only 30% of the trading giants' 
overall business, and the shosha are beginning to serve non-Japanese as well as 
Japanese clients, tackling new ventures and investing around the world. Mitsui, 
for example, now lists about 1,000 subsidiaries and "affiliated companies." 
</P>
<P>
 "It is wrong to think of the sogo shosha simply as traders," said Minoru 
Murofushi, president of Itochu Corp., the No. 1 trading company. "We are 
financiers, investors, developers, coordinators and consultants. We are 
innovators, continually venturing into new areas." 
</P>
<P>
 Added Mitsui's Kumagai: "The trading company has become a knowledge-intensive 
service industry." In addition to traditional fields such as securing supplies 
of natural resources, fish and agricultural goods for Japan and exporting 
machinery, steel and chemicals, in recent years the shosha have entered the 
fields of computer software, telecommunications, satellites, real estate 
development, oil exploration and media and entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, nothing seems too big or too offbeat. 
</P>
<P>
 To bring liquefied natural gas to Japan, Mitsui, for example, put together 
developer consortiums and liquefaction plants in Abu Dhabi and in Australia and 
purchaser consortiums of electric power and gas companies in Japan; built 
liquefied natural gas tankers, and arranged all of the financing. The Australia 
project cost $19 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 New facilities under construction at a cost of $120 million at the Port of Los 
Angeles -- to handle 9 million tons a year of steam coal and petroleum coke for 
export to Japan, South Korea and Taiwan -- were financed in part by 11 Japanese 
trading firms. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, the shosha raise chickens for Kentucky Fried Chicken shops 
here and supervise box-lunch delivery three times a day to 7-Eleven stores. 
</P>
<P>
 They also serve as "sensors" for Japan's business world -- pinpointing demand 
for new products, discovering new technology that manufacturers can 
commercialize and shifting personnel to exploit new markets, Yamashita said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 After the first oil shock in the 1970s, shosha bolstered their staffs in the 
Middle East and quickly increased Japanese exports to the region awash in 
petrodollars. The latest shift in focus is to China. 
</P>
<P>
 The largest chunk of business for the average trading company -- 44% -- comes 
from wholesaling and business ventures in the domestic market. But the biggest 
growth segment is third-country trade in which Japan is neither the exporter 
nor the importer. A quarter of sales now come from this sector. 
</P>
<P>
 With the spread of Japanese factories in Asia, for instance, shosha are 
increasing exports to the United States and Europe of Japanese products made 
offshore. The U.S. Commerce Department last year found that Japanese 
subsidiaries in the United States got 23% of their imports from third 
countries, more than any other nation's U.S.-based subsidiaries. 
</P>
<P>
 And increasingly they also are handling non-Japanese products. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitsui & Co., for example, is marketing Du Pont chemicals in the Asia Pacific 
region; Unisys computers in Latin America, Eastern Europe, the Commonwealth of 
Independent States and Southeast Asia; Caterpillar bulldozers in Russia, and 
General Electric power plants in Thailand and Indonesia. 
</P>
<P>
 The steep appreciation of the yen has promoted such alliances. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitsui serves as General Electric's agent in Japan, and its relationship with 
the U.S. giant dates back to prewar days. But GE's major sales here consisted 
of selling the first power plant of its kind and then turning over to either 
Toshiba or Hitachi the manufacture of all subsequent same-model plants, "thus 
developing the heavy electric machinery industry in Japan," said Hiroshi Otaka, 
general manager of Mitsui's electric machinery international division. 
</P>
<P>
 Beginning around 1965, Mitsui started exporting power-generating equipment 
made by Toshiba, one of the 34 Mitsui Group companies. 
</P>
<P>
 "Japanese products were not that good, but the price was very inexpensive," 
Otaka said. "But at an exchange rate of slightly more than 100 yen to the 
dollar, (Toshiba products) no longer are competitive." 
</P>
<P>
 That's why Mitsui is now selling GE products to its Asian customers, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 GE finds it advantageous to use Mitsui because the trading company pays for 
the machinery upfront, assumes the risk of building the power plants and 
arranges the financing -- part of which has recently been provided by the 
export-import banks of both Japan and the United States, Otaka said. 
</P>
<P>
 Trading companies also are unique in Japan for ranking among the world's least 
profitable businesses. Although figures for turnover are bloated by accounting 
practices that include the value of products sold -- not just shosha fees -- 
net profit has been recently running as low as 0.1% and 0.2% of sales, 
according to Yukio Onuma, manager of Itochu's research department. 
</P>
<P>
 Shosha executives claim they are determined to raise profits, yet they remain 
committed to activities that American executives would have abandoned long ago. 
Amano, for example, explained his company's dedication to ensuring a steady 
supply of iron ore to Japan by declaring that the low-profit business has a 
"social meaning." 
</P>
<P>
 Tolerance of minuscule profits is even more amazing in view of the risks. 
</P>
<P>
 A shosha will either buy exports or imports directly from a manufacturer, 
eliminating any possible loss from foreign exchange fluctuations, or provide 
hedges against currency movement. In multibillion-dollar overseas projects, 
trading companies even hedge risks by entering alliances with their rivals. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But disasters, such as development by a Mitsui-led consortium of a 
petrochemical complex in Iran, do occur. Launched in 1971, the complex was 
damaged during the Iran-Iraq War and collapsed under political turmoil in Iran. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitsui, which held a 60% share, lost nearly $2.4 billion (at the current 
exchange rate) while other Japanese partners saw nearly $1.6 billion disappear, 
a Mitsui spokesman said. Only 20% of the losses were covered by Japanese 
government insurance, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps most fundamental to shosha is the intimacy and the history of business 
relationships built up over generations. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitsui salespeople, for example, visit Tokyo Electric Power Co. nearly every 
day and obtain information on all of the power company's investment and 
purchase plans, according to Otaka. 
</P>
<P>
 For Toyota, which needs exporting help perhaps less than any other firm in 
Japan, Mitsui helps sell products in Canada, Latin America, Southeast Asia and 
Africa. It also is a partner in Toyota production in Colombia and Turkey. 
</P>
<P>
 The relationship began when Mitsui -- in 1899 -- started acting as agent to 
sell an automatic spinning loom invented by Sakichi Toyoda, whose son was later 
to found Toyota Motor Co. That contract, which lifted the invention from 
obscurity, is still remembered by executives of both companies. Japan's Trading

PACIFIC RIM TRADE; ASIA; FEWER BARRIERS MAKE FOR GOOD NEIGHBORS; INTRA-ASIAN 
COMMERCE IS ON THE RISE. LAST YEAR, JAPAN'S TRADE SURPLUS WITH ITS REGIONAL 
PARTNERS EXCEEDED ITS SURPLUS WITH THE U.S. 
</P>

<P>
 Lost in the debate about the United States' trade deficit with Japan is a new 
cause for anxiety on this side of the Pacific: Japan is dominating the booming 
trade with Asian nations as well. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time, in the year that ended March 31, Asian nations ran up a 
bigger trade deficit with Tokyo ($55.95 billion) than did the United States 
($51.14 billion). 
</P>
<P>
 "In 1985 . . . Japan exported a third more to the United States than it did to 
Asia," noted a study by Deutsche Bank Capital Markets. "It now exports a third 
more to Asia than it does to America." 
</P>
<P>
 One of the factors behind the Asian nations' greater trade deficit was Japan's 
recession, which drastically cut imports from Asian states. But the 
strengthening yen also played a role. 
</P>
<P>
 Japanese multinationals accelerated their efforts to move their factories from 
the Japanese mainland to foreign countries, mainly to Southeast Asia and China, 
because the high yen makes Japanese-made products too expensive to compete. 
</P>
<P>
 When a Japanese company sets up a factory overseas, it usually imports the 
machine tools and other capital goods needed from Japan, helping to turn the 
trade balance in Japan's favor. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, with the rest of Asia growing more prosperous, imports of cars and 
other Japanese products are on the rise, further worsening the trade imbalance. 
</P>
<P>
 So great are the trade disparities that some Asian nations have raised special 
barriers to Japanese goods. 
</P>
<P>
 South Korea, which ran an $8.5-billion trade deficit with Japan last year, now 
bans the import of 230 items from Japan, including cars, video players, cameras 
and chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the Southeast Asian nations are hoping that as Japan pulls out of its 
recession, more and more consumer goods manufactured in the region will find 
their way back to the Japanese market. 
</P>
<P>
 The trade frictions between Japan and the rest of Asia point up another 
phenomenon that is frequently lost in the debate about transpacific trade: 
Trade within Asia is growing increasingly important. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, Asian nations reached a watershed by trading more with themselves 
than with the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "We see more and more of our exports going to Asia," Singapore's founding 
father, Lee Kuan Yew, noted recently. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, Singapore sent nearly half its exports to Asian countries. Not only 
are six of its eight top markets in Asia, but Singapore is the biggest trading 
partner of Vietnam, Cambodia and Myanmar. 
</P>
<P>
 Pearl Iboshi, an economist at the East-West Center in Honolulu, said that 
trade patterns in Asia have closely followed investments. 
</P>
<P>
 "Investments have fueled trade, especially in intermediate goods," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, Iboshi said, Taiwan and South Korea have been major investors in 
Southeast Asian nations such as Thailand and Indonesia in industries where 
labor costs are a key factor: textiles, shoes, electronics. Taiwan and South 
Korea are doing exactly what the Japanese did before them, exporting those 
industries where they are no longer competitive using plants on their own soil 
because of high domestic wages. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Iboshi said that while intra-Asian trade has advanced significantly in recent 
years, her studies suggest that most of the final products are still going to 
the United States. A computer disk drive manufactured in Penang, Malaysia, for 
example, might be exported to Taiwan, to be installed in a laptop computer that 
is destined ultimately for the U.S. market. But the drive and other components 
would be counted as intra-Asian trade. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, investors are taking note of the rapidly developing prosperity of 
the Southeast Asian market, which, with Vietnam included, now totals nearly 500 
million people. 
</P>
<P>
 Thailand has become the world's second-largest market for Toyota cars, and 
Japanese auto makers are increasingly shifting their production to Thailand to 
serve not only the domestic market but as a production hub for Southeast Asia. 
Hitachi and Mitsubishi Electric have also announced major expansion plans for 
their home appliance production facilities in Thailand. 
</P>
<P>
 Honda Motors recently announced plans to build a $40-million car-parts factory 
on the outskirts of Bangkok to serve Thailand and the entire Southeast Asian 
region. 
</P>
<P>
 "This will be in line with our plan whereby the Philippines, Malaysia, 
Indonesia and Thailand are able to exchange parts as each country makes 
different parts," said Koji Nagata, managing director of Honda Motor Co. Ltd. 
</P>
<P>
 Most Southeast Asian nations, which were among the world's fastest growing in 
the 1980s, suffered a sharp falloff in investment last year as big companies 
diverted their resources to China. 
</P>
<P>
 Asian investment in China surged 501% last year, to $52 billion, and dropped 
12% in Indonesia, 19% in Malaysia and a sharp 51% in Thailand. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the Assn. of Southeast Asian Nations -- Thailand, Malaysia, 
Singapore, Indonesia, Brunei and the Philippines -- are hoping to stimulate 
regional trade by adopting what they call the ASEAN Free Trade Area, which is 
supposed to lower tariffs on imports in the region to zero in 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan got under way in January, but few countries cut their duties 
significantly at the outset because of domestic pressures to protect home-grown 
industry. Nevertheless, officials are hopeful for the future. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think eventually the ASEAN Free Trade Area will accelerate the trend toward 
intra-ASEAN trade," said Washington SyCip, a Manila business consultant. 
</P>
<P>
 One indirect sign of a trend came in last month's complaint by the Australian 
subsidiary of cereal maker Kellogg that it will suffer in competition against 
Swiss food giant Nestle because Nestle has set up joint ventures in ASEAN 
countries and will enjoy lower tariffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Another factor affecting regional trade is the sudden growth of cross-border 
development plans, such as the Singapore-Johor-Riau Growth Triangle. These 
plans take advantage of lower-cost labor in one country and use the financial 
resources of others to produce a product that may end up crossing three borders 
before the product is ready for final export. 
</P>
<P>
 The granddaddy of growth triangles is the China-Hong Kong-Taiwanese model, but 
other zones have formed among Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand and among 
Thailand, Myanmar, Laos and southern China.

PACIFIC RIM TRADE; LOS ANGELES AND LONG BEACH; PORTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A modern port is a maze of wharfs handling different types of ships and cargo, 
with computers doing more and more of the work. Los Angeles and Long Beach are 
among the world's biggest container ports. Sitting side by side, they compete 
for traffic. Container Ships Containers are standard-sized aluminum boxes, 
either 20 or 40 feet long by 8 feet by 8 feet. They are loaded with goods -- 
everything from perfume to electronic products -- and then stacked directly 
onto trucks or railroad cars and moved to ports. 
</P>
<P>
 At the port, giant cranes moving along rails on the docks hoist the containers 
and then lowers them one upon the other onto the ship. A clerk, working with a 
computer mockup of the hull, devises a plan for loading. 
</P>
<P>
 Numbered and computer chip on each container help track contents, destination 
and shipper. Oil Tankers 
</P>
<P>
 The first ocean-going tanker was launched in 1866. Today, oil supertankers may 
measure more than 1,300 feet long and carry more than 500,000 short tons of 
oil. 
</P>
<P>
 Although most tankers carry oil, some haul cleaning fluids, fruit juices, 
vegetable oils, wines and other liquids. These are loaded and unloaded in a 
slightly different manner than is the oil tanker shown here. 
</P>
<P>
 Hydraulically controlled loading arms on the dock are levered into place, 
connecting to pipelines on the ship. Oil is then pumped into or out of the 
tanks. Los Angeles Vs. Long Beach Total cargo value, 1992 (in billions) Los

PACIFIC RIM TRADE; AMERICA; U.S. MARKET'S SIZE LURES INNOVATORS; CUSTOMER BASES 
CAN BE HUGE HERE. BUT BECAUSE OF THAT VERY POTENTIAL, THE STRUGGLE TO SELL IS A 
NEVER-ENDING BATTLE.

 For Michael Mun, president of the Singapore-based computer-peripherals 
manufacturer Aztech Systems Pte. Ltd., expanding into the U.S. market has been 
a dream come true. 
</P>
<P>
 "No matter how you look at it, the U.S.A. is the single largest consumer 
market in the world," Mun said. "And the U.S. market easily accepts new 
technology, new products. I think the use of computers there is more widespread 
than in any other country." 
</P>
<P>
 A maker of items such as computer soundboards and CD-ROM drives, Aztech 
entered the American market in mid-1992, making about $10 million in U.S. sales 
out of $50 million in worldwide sales that year, Mun said. Last year, out of 
$92 million in global sales, nearly $50 million worth was made in the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
 The allure of selling to America shines throughout the Pacific Rim countries, 
inspiring determined efforts not only from major corporations but also by the 
thousands of small and medium-sized entrepreneurial firms that help give this 
region its dynamism. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a lot of potential for us in the U.S. market," said Stephen Leung, 
director of Star Industrial, a Hong Kong plastics-ware manufacturer. "Although 
it's a very competitive market, it's still a lot clearer and more accessible 
than most parts of the world." 
</P>
<P>
 The total size of the European Union's market exceeds that of the United 
States, but Europe "has different standards and living conditions and language 
and so on," agreed Mitsuo Takii, director of the Americas Division in the 
research department of the Japan External Trade Organization. He continued:  
</P>
<P>
 "The United States is a very important market for Japanese companies because 
it is the largest common market in the world with the same language, the same 
way of life, the same standards." 
</P>
<P>
 But while the American market may be big, important and open, that doesn't 
mean it's easy. The very openness of America means the competitive struggle to 
sell is a never-ending battle. 
</P>
<P>
 Star Industrial's Red A brand of plastic kitchenware is firmly entrenched in 
Hong Kong and has a strong presence in other Asian markets. But as Leung has 
pushed to expand in the United States -- often making products for sale under 
American brand names -- he's encountered plenty of frustration. 
</P>
<P>
 "We develop relations with customers and manufacturers in which the first year 
is always a year of trial and error," Leung explained. "We figure out all the 
errors and iron out all the bugs in the first year, so we really don't make any 
money the first year. If the product line is a success, we probably will break 
even by the second year and make a profit in the third year." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 That's when trouble begins again. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most likely after three years," he said, "some U.S. customers would probably 
throw in the question someplace, 'You supply this item for me for $1, but 
someone else can supply it for 95 cents.' So frustrations like this always come 
up." 
</P>
<P>
 For Aztech, a major problem was that American customers sometimes got so 
frustrated trying to install computer peripherals that they gave up and 
returned them. Much of Aztech's equipment is sold to manufacturers, but items 
such as soundboards, which provide computers with voice or audio capacity, are 
also sold directly to the public for do-it-yourself installation. 
</P>
<P>
 "You must be very consumer-oriented" in the United States, Mun said. "It must 
be easy to install and easy to understand. In the early days, we tried to 
explain it in a very lengthy format, and we created a lot of confusion. Most 
users don't read the manuals in much detail. If you put in a lot of computer 
jargon, it will be returned." 
</P>
<P>
 So Aztech made a determined effort at creating simplified instructions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now we have a lot of graphics, and we try to limit the instructions to one 
page," he said. "We learned from our mistakes. . . . As a company from the Far 
East, we had a lot to learn about American culture, American philosophy and 
thinking, and how business is conducted." 
</P>
<P>
 In another field, toys, Japanese manufacturer Takara Co. Ltd. finds American 
consumers rather easy to please. But there are other problems. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, the high value of the yen in recent years -- which drives up the 
cost of Japanese goods in dollar terms -- has made it virtually impossible for 
Japanese-made toys to be sold in the competitive U.S. market, according to 
Tamio Watabiki, head of the firm's international division. So Takara makes toys 
for the Japanese market in Japan, but toys for the U.S. market are made 
according to its specifications in China, Indonesia and Macao, then sold 
through American toy companies under their brand names. 
</P>
<P>
 "Japanese consumers are very much ultra-strict on the quality of toys," 
Watabiki said. "They care too much about small things, while American consumers 
are very generous." On cosmetic matters such as traces of excess plastic left 
from the molding process, toys bound for the United States don't require the 
same level of quality demanded of toys in Japan. Packaging can be simpler too. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Japanese consumers like deluxe boxes," the Takara executive explained. But in 
the United States, where 70% of all toys are sold at discount stores or 
supermarkets, it is perfectly acceptable to use "blister packaging," with the 
toy placed on cardboard and covered with plastic wrapping. Partly as a result 
of such differences, toys cost half as much in the United States as in Japan, 
Watabiki said. 
</P>
<P>
 What Takara cares about most in the U.S. market is having balanced, 
cooperative relationships with American toy manufacturers such as Hasbro Inc., 
Mattel Inc. and Tyco Toys Inc., he said. "These ties enable Takara to bring 
U.S. toy concepts to Japan. That's our corporate strategy. We do not want to be 
a competitor with U.S. toy companies. We would rather be a partner." 
</P>
<P>
 As an illustration of the business, Watabiki pointed to the way toy concepts 
based on Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles have bounced around the Pacific Rim. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ninja Turtles were conceived by two American artists who founded Mirage 
Studios, and popularized mainly by the U.S. operations of Hong Kong-based 
Playmates Toys. Watabiki arranged rights in Japan for Takara, which proceeded 
to develop its own versions of Ninja Turtle toys. Now Takara has sold some of 
its Ninja Turtle concept modifications back to Playmates for use in toys sold 
in the U.S. market. 
</P>
<P>
 Takara's emphasis on its home market is reflected in its sales figures. Out of 
total global sales of $430 million for its 1993 fiscal year, $385 million was 
in Japan and about $20 million in the United States. But U.S. operations are 
still "very important," Watabiki said, largely because of this two-way concept 
flow. "We are much dependent on a company like Hasbro," he said, noting that 
Takara has marketed Hasbro's "Game of Life" board game in Japan for 26 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "The U.S. is very rich in worldwide popular characters," he added. "They have 
Ninja Turtles, they have GI Joes, they have many things." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 The niches that exporters from different Asian countries find in the U.S. 
market tend to change as industrialization spreads through the Pacific Rim. In 
the late 1950s, South Korea's textile industry employed one-fifth of the 
country's labor force, and clothing exports to the United States provided most 
of its foreign exchange. By 1987, textile exports surpassed $10 billion, making 
South Korea the third-largest textile exporter in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, strict textile quotas in the United States and other overseas 
markets, together with the emergence of other South Korean export industries 
such as petrochemicals, electronics and heavy industrial goods, have led to a 
sharp drop-off in the importance of the textile trade. More than half the 
country's textile exporters have either switched to other items or gone out of 
business. One of the survivors is Choi Young Ae, 40, who founded Y. A. 
International in 1981 after working for nine years at a large trading company. 
</P>
<P>
 Choi prospered by positioning her firm to deliver higher-quality products than 
those produced by emerging textile powers, such as China, while keeping prices 
below what Japanese manufacturers charge. Her determination to hang on was 
buttressed by a 1987 trip to survey the U.S. market, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I found there was an unlimited market there. I saw Americans change their 
clothes very often. They dress differently for work, for parties and for 
recreation." 
</P>
<P>
 Choi persuaded managers at the factories that supplied her goods to upgrade 
their products with complex patterns and higher-quality materials. She also 
established stable links with U.S. importers such as M. M. Fab Inc. and Morex 
Enterprises. 
</P>
<P>
 A key to success in the United States is creativity, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Quality product is not the only thing needed," she said. "You need to pay 
close attention to market trends, the fashion industry, and you must satisfy 
clients' needs with good service. Most important is that in this business, you 
must be prepared to work really hard. Nine-to-five does not apply."

PACIFIC RIM TRADE; CALIFORNIA; GOLDEN STATE FINDS GOLDEN OPPORTUNITIES IN ASIA; 
ALREADY THE U.S. LEADER IN EXPORTS TO THE REGION, WE ARE AT THE FOREFRONT OF 
HELPING DEVELOPING NATIONS IMPROVE THEIR INFRASTRUCTURES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 California's ties across the Pacific were once a simple matter of exports and 
imports. Not so anymore. 
</P>
<P>
 Take Advanced Aerodynamics & Structures Inc., a fledgling North Hollywood 
maker of corporate jets. Its president, Carl Chen, was born in Fuzhou on the 
southeastern coast of China, and in 1949, when he was 4, his family fled to 
Taiwan ahead of the Communist takeover of the mainland. 
</P>
<P>
 Chen arrived in the United States in 1968, was educated at UCLA and Caltech 
and worked for Hughes Aircraft Co. before helping found AASI four years ago. 
The company's main financial backers include a Taiwanese industrialist, Yeh 
Song Gen, who has helped raise $25 million to develop the single-engine 
Jetcruzer, which is awaiting Federal Aviation Administration certification. 
</P>
<P>
 And the company is seeking customers not just in the United States, but also 
in Europe, the Middle East and in Asia, where Chen's language capability -- he 
speaks Mandarin and other dialects of Chinese -- provides an entree. 
</P>
<P>
 It is the foreign ties that Chen hopes will make his firm one of the few 
successful aircraft start-ups in recent years, eventually creating hundreds of 
new, high-wage jobs. California cities such as Palmdale and Long Beach already 
are vying for AASI's manufacturing plant against competitors as far away as 
Virginia, South Africa and Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the Pacific Rim will take 30% (of the business) eventually," Chen 
said. "Especially China, because they just opened up and they need lots of high 
tech and aircraft to fill the gap." 
</P>
<P>
 AASI is a prime example of the ever-increasing integration of the economy and 
entrepreneurs of California with those of Asia -- to the benefit of both. 
</P>
<P>
 California's Asian ties now involve firms as large as Hughes Aircraft, which 
is developing an extensive network of satellite communications for Indonesia 
and Malaysia, and as small as AASI, which currently employs only 20 to 30 
people. 
</P>
<P>
 The economies of Asian nations -- with Japan a notable exception -- are among 
the most robust in the world, with growth rates approaching 8% a year, said 
Richard Drobnick, director of the Center for International Business at USC. 
</P>
<P>
 And California is uniquely positioned to take advantage of expanding market 
opportunities there. "Because of our Asian connections through the university 
systems, through immigration and through all of the Asian firms that have 
located their subsidiaries here as their entry point into the U.S., we are more 
connected than other states with these high-growth economies," Drobnick 
explained. 
</P>
<P>
 Already, California is by far the leading state exporting to Asia. The value 
figure has grown from $22.4 billion in 1988 to $33.5 billion in 1993, an 
increase of more than 9% a year, according to the Massachusetts Institute for 
Social and Economic Research. California's rising exports to Asia have taken 
place in a period when its shipments to other parts of the world have remained 
flat or fallen. 
</P>
<P>
 Economics writer Joel Kotkin says the future lies not so much with Japan, 
whose growth has stalled, but elsewhere in Asia. 
</P>
<P>
 "The big change for California in the 1990s will be the shift from being 
Japan-centered to East Asian-centered, predominantly the Chinese diaspora and 
China," said Kotkin, author of "Tribes," a book that examines the successful 
business relationships among Chinese immigrants around the world. "It's already 
taking place: in investment, in the fastest-growing markets and in the 
immigration networks that are being formed." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Other experts point to South Korea, Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand as 
nations with great promise for increased California trade and investment as 
those economies awaken. 
</P>
<P>
 The two-way trade covers everything "from airplanes to xylophones," Drobnick 
says. The American and California toy industries, for example, count on Chinese 
manufacturers for much of their inventory. Asian importers, meanwhile, depend 
on California for off-season fresh produce such as oranges and cherries. 
</P>
<P>
 Lately, however, California firms have been at the forefront of helping 
developing Asian nations improve their infrastructures and industries, selling 
them commercial aircraft, telecommunications hardware, computers and software, 
high-tech equipment, even power plants: 
</P>
<P>
 * McDonnell Douglas' Long Beach-based Douglas Aircraft unit makes and exports 
MD-80 commercial jets for assembly in Shanghai in a deal valued at more than $1 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
 * Irvine-based AST Research Inc., a maker of personal computers, was the first 
major PC maker to enter the Chinese market and remains the biggest seller of 
such computers there. 
</P>
<P>
 * In February, Mission Energy, the Irvine-based power-generation unit of 
SCEcorp and sister firm of Southern California Edison Co., said it will become 
a leading partner in an international consortium that will build, own and 
operate a major new power plant in Indonesia. 
</P>
<P>
 The project is one of the most visible in a major push by Asian nations to 
upgrade their electrical power grids to meet the needs of expanding economies, 
experts say. 
</P>
<P>
 The Indonesia project will involve construction costs of $1.8 billion and 
employ 3,500 workers to build and operate it. Mission's partners include 
General Electric Co., Japan's Mitsui & Co. and Indonesia's P. T. Batu Hitam 
Perkasa. Upon completion in 1998, the plant will be one of the largest 
privately owned power plants in the world, and a model for others. 
</P>
<P>
 "This certainly represents a major element of the future . . . in Indonesia 
and in China," said Mission's president and chief executive, Edward R. Muller. 
"Mission Energy, based here in California, will be leading such projects all 
over the world." 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, Hughes Aircraft's space and communications company has been 
designing and making satellites since the 1970s to help tie Indonesia's 14,000 
islands together with modern communications. Last April, the company signed a 
multimillion-dollar contract to build the third generation of such satellites, 
the so-called Palapa-C series of two satellites to be launched in 1995 and 
1996. All told, several generations of satellites have represented between $350 
million and $400 million in Indonesian contracts for Hughes, said project 
manager George Tadler. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For Tadler, who has been to Indonesia eight times in recent years to 
coordinate the projects, the pace at which nations such as Indonesia are 
investing in California-generated 21st-Century technology results in startling 
contrasts. 
</P>
<P>
 "The countryside is like any other Asian Pacific nation: primitive, with rice 
fields and people living in substandard housing. . . . People still wash 
clothes in rivers and bays," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "But when you get to the cities, like Jakarta, there are tall modern glass 
buildings, and every place you look they're putting up new high-rise 
structures." As a result, he said, "there's lots of stuff we can do for 
Indonesia. There's direct (satellite) television, which we're introducing to 
the U.S. right about now, and . . . it's certainly something Indonesia could 
use. . . . Also, there are satellite systems for mobile communications, and 
they're thinking and talking about that."  
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, a sister company, Hughes Network Systems Inc., said in April that it 
had signed an $80-million contract with a public-private Indonesian joint 
venture to begin supplying a new wireless telephone system for customers in 
Jakarta. 
</P>
<P>
 The California connection works on a variety of levels, and the state could 
find itself unusually vulnerable to the vagaries of politics. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, if instead of renewing China's most-favored-nation status, 
President Clinton had decided to revoke or modify it, such a step could have 
had a considerable effect on the state's economy, business leaders argue. 
</P>
<P>
 California exports to China alone total more than $1.7 billion annually, 
supporting about 35,000 state jobs, according to the Business Coalition for 
U.S.-China Trade, an ad-hoc group of about 400 state businesses that opposed 
eliminating China's trade status. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The state's farming leaders, meanwhile, worry about the prospects of 
agricultural embargoes by Japan, South Korea and other Asian nations that say 
they fear importation of the Mediterranean fruit fly.  
</P>
<P>
 A February study by UC Berkeley Prof. Jerome B. Siebert predicted that an 
embargo would focus on several varieties of fruit and vegetable crops, result 
in short-term losses of $564 million in net revenue a year and ultimately set 
back the state's agricultural economy by $1 billion to $1.4 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 That loss would ripple through the state's overall economy, resulting in 
reduced output and income and losses of up to 14,189 state jobs, Siebert said. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, however, there's no sign that Asian nations will mount such an 
embargo, and the Japanese, for one, continue to buy California produce.

 * As of November, 1992, there were more than 5,100 container ships in the 
world with a total capacity of more than 3.6 million TEU's. 
</P>
<P>
 * About 8,000 people form the longshore work force on the West Coast. 
</P>
<P>
 * Aborigines are thought to have been able to cross the Torres Strait from New 
Guinea to Australia -- then at least 43 miles across -- as early as 55000 B.C. 
It is believed that they used double canoes. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Jahre Viking is the world's largest tanker. It has a deadweight of 
622,420 tons, is 1,471 feet long, 225 feet, 11 inches wide and 80 feet, 9 
inches deep. The maximum ship width for passage through the Panama Canal is 
105.97 feet. 
</P>
<P>
 * The fastest transpacific crossing from Yokohama, Japan, to Long Beach -- 
4,840 nautical miles (5,567.64 miles) -- took 6 days, 1 hour, 27 minutes. It 
was made by the container ship Sea-Land commerce from June 30 to July 6, 1973, 
at an average speed of 33.27 knots (38.31 m.p.h.). 
</P>
<P>
 * As of July 1, 1992, the number of the world's merchant ships (excluding 
vessels of less than 100 gross tonnage, sailing vessels and barges) stood at 
72,845. 
</P>
<P>
 * The record for the heaviest commercial air cargo shipment is claimed by the 
Russian manufacturer Antonov and the British charter company Air Foyle. They 
transported three transformers weighing 53 tons each and other equipment from 
Barcelona, Spain, to Noumea, New Caledonia between Jan. 10 and Jan. 14, 1991. 
The total weight carried in the An-124 Rusian was 164.6 tons.

PACIFIC RIM TRADE; AMERICA; IN TRADE DEBATES, THE PUBLIC OPTS OUT; AMERICANS 
DON'T OFTEN GET EXCITED ABOUT TRADE POLICY. TIMES OF ECONOMIC UPHEAVAL CAN STIR 
THEIR ANGER, THOUGH. 
</P>

<P>
 As diplomats hammered out final details of a new world trade agreement last 
December in Geneva, hundreds of journalists packed the hall but only a few were 
from the United States, the No. 1 trading nation and the one with the most at 
stake. 
</P>
<P>
 Completion of the new trade rules under the General Agreement on Tariffs and 
Trade sent 200,000 angry Indians into a violent protest in New Delhi. But in 
America, the trade plan drew scant public interest. Even last fall's debate 
over the North American Free Trade Agreement, which strikes close to home, 
attracted only a few thousand people to occasional rallies staged by opponents. 
Pro-NAFTA demonstrations drew even fewer. 
</P>
<P>
 It would seem that most Americans view trade issues with monumental 
indifference. Not so. Trade is an issue that is deeply embedded in the nation's 
political landscape. But it is one that remains latent for long periods, 
surfacing only sporadically, particularly during times of economic upheaval. 
</P>
<P>
 And even when it tops the national agenda, trade tends to defy traditional 
political analysis. In trade policy, like foreign policy, partisanship stops at 
the water's edge. 
</P>
<P>
 "Trade is a bipartisan and nonpartisan issue. It is not ideological," U.S. 
Trade Representative Mickey Kantor said in a speech last month. "It would be 
devastating for this country . . . to make this a partisan issue." 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, trade is an issue with a long and colorful history in the United 
States, and it involves an extensive web of political and economic connections 
that Presidents, lawmakers and negotiators ignore at their peril. 
</P>
<P>
 The stiff import tariffs that were applied, under heavy political pressure, at 
the start of the Great Depression are but one example. The difficulties faced 
by President Clinton last month as he decided to extend China's 
most-favored-nation trading status, despite a lack of progress by Beijing in 
addressing human rights issues, are but the most recent. 
</P>
<P>
 Political leaders around the world typically express their devotion to the 
concept of free trade and endorse the idea of holding quotas, tariffs and other 
restrictions to an absolute minimum. But their allegiance to free trade in the 
abstract often falls by the wayside in the reality of day-to-day politics. For 
instance, said a congressional staffer actively involved in trade issues, the 
American people "look elsewhere for the culprit during a period of problems. 
The last place you will lay blame is yourself." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In such circumstances, he said, foreign trade offers a ready, if primarily 
symbolic, response for politicians. When the economy is troubled, they focus 
blame beyond the nation's borders. 
</P>
<P>
 "It (trade) is an issue most other countries deal with on a continuing basis, 
with pretty much the same intensity," the official said. But, he said, speaking 
on condition of anonymity, in the United States it is a subject more often 
below the surface of public debate, "so it is primed (only) by the political 
pump." 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, when the Clinton Administration felt a need to "stand up for the 
American worker," Japan's trade policies provided a convenient target in 
mid-1993 and early 1994. But, he added, "as the economy has gotten better, 
there is a waning of interest" in trade relations with Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
 A Los Angeles Times poll in April found only five out of 1,682 people 
questioned who volunteered that foreign trade was the most important problem 
facing the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 On a day-to-day basis, trade issues may be higher on the political agenda in 
Europe or Japan than they are in the United States, and therefore may appear 
open to more routine handling. In fact, they are no less volatile overseas. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the political clout of French farmers -- and sympathetic urban voters 
devoted to the romantic image, if not the reality, of French rural life -- that 
for years blocked approval of the agricultural provisions in the recent GATT 
round. In Japan, Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa left office in April amid 
criticism of his failure to strike a new trade agreement with the United 
States. It wasn't the sole factor in his departure, but it played a 
contributing role. 
</P>
<P>
 In the United States, partisan divisions over trade issues are rare. For 
instance, Clinton found support among Republicans and Democrats alike as he 
fought successfully for congressional approval of NAFTA last fall, affirming 
American acceptance of more open trade among the United States, Mexico and 
Canada. 
</P>
<P>
 Do such alliances mean a trade negotiator can ignore congressional crosswinds 
and the interests of constituencies in writing a trade agreement? Of course 
not, said one former negotiator, adding: "I was as attentive as I could 
conceivably be." 
</P>
<P>
 Some issues are less likely to attract the political spotlight. Intellectual 
property rights -- the protection, for example, of U.S. patents guarding 
biotechnology products -- "never resonate with anyone other than a small 
community" in Congress, said one trade expert. 
</P>
<P>
 But when trade disputes are linked to volatile public issues -- such as human 
rights in China, the opening of Japanese markets to U.S. products and Clinton's 
willingness to open diplomatic and trade relations with Vietnam -- they 
"clearly have grass-roots resonance, grass-roots understanding and grass-roots 
impact," the trade specialist said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the heart of the Administration's decisions on these difficult issues, said 
Claude Barfield, a trade expert at the American Enterprise Institute, is this 
question: "How can we do the right thing without taking a lot of flak?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Producers and workers threatened by imports tend to be concentrated, 
organized and ready and able to press their interests in the political arena. 
Those who benefit from trade are diffuse, and their stake in any particular 
trade matter is usually small," I. M. Destler wrote in "American Trade 
Politics," a highly regarded study first published in 1983 and revised in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Last year's NAFTA debate was a remarkable exception. Supporters who stressed 
the potential long-range gains from increased exports to Mexico were able to 
prevail over those concerned about the more immediate impact of Mexican 
products competing with higher-cost goods made in U.S. factories. 
</P>
<P>
 There usually is an imbalance, Destler wrote, between those riding an economic 
wave and those being swamped by it. "Firms with expanding markets and ample 
profits tend to concentrate on business; their worry is that government may get 
in their way by placing constraints on their flexibility and their profits," he 
pointed out. "It is the embattled losers in trade who go into politics to seek 
trade protection." 
</P>
<P>
 So, he said, quoting a former trade official, it is an "unnatural act" for a 
politician to vote to lower trade barriers, particularly in the face of 
well-organized interests seeking quotas on imports or higher tariffs to protect 
a local industry. 
</P>
<P>
 While the economy provided the text for the 1992 presidential campaign, trade 
-- and the role of lower trade barriers -- offered an important subtext. 
Throughout the campaign, then-President George Bush tried to use his own 
support for NAFTA, which removes trade barriers among the United States, Mexico 
and Canada, as a weapon against challenger Clinton. Clinton waited until 
October, one month before the election, to tackle the sensitive issue, and then 
offered only his conditional support. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the election, Clinton aides have noted that it would have been much 
easier for their candidate to gain support in America's industrial heartland, 
where NAFTA was unpopular, had he openly opposed the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 Which brings us back to Geneva, and the negotiations to rewrite the rules that 
have governed international trade since the end of World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 In the closing days of the GATT talks, negotiators were meeting nearly 24 
hours a day. Even so, a senior aide in the U.S. delegation managed to find time 
each day to make his way to a meeting room at the Intercontinental Hotel. 
There, he sat with a team of lobbyists representing such diverse segments of 
the U.S. economy as agriculture, entertainment, textiles, steel and 
pharmaceuticals, delivering a classified briefing on the latest developments in 
the negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 There was nothing nefarious about it. Nor, officials said, were the lobbyists 
given insider information. Rather, the briefers were simply recognizing an 
unavoidable fact of life in the world of trade and politics: 
</P>
<P>
 When the world trade pact was completed, the lobbyists would return to 
Washington. Without their support, the Administration would stand little chance 
of winning congressional approval of the pact.

PACIFIC RIM TRADE; ASIA; HOW TWO GIANTS EMERGED FROM WAR'S RUBBLE AND GREW; 
JAPAN AND SOUTH KOREA TOOK SIMILAR PATHS TO ECONOMIC RENEWAL. BUT SEOUL STILL 
HAS WAR ON ITS MIND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 In 1987, South Korea's government trade organization issued a paper that tried 
to quell increasing fears that the nation's fast-growing economy was becoming 
another trade headache for the United States and others. The title: "Korea Is 
Not Another Japan." 
</P>
<P>
 Ever since this East Asian tiger roared forward with spectacular economic 
growth built on the rubble of war, comparisons with Japan have, for better or 
worse, been inevitable.  
</P>
<P>
 Most of the scrutiny has been motivated by efforts to learn the secret of the 
"economic miracle" enjoyed by both nations. On the surface, the similarities 
are striking: Both nations built their war-shattered economies largely on 
exports, close cooperation between government and business and Confucian ethics 
of education, strong family ties and hard work. 
</P>
<P>
 But as both nations amassed burgeoning trade surpluses, U.S. business leaders 
and politicians began seeing a darker side to the miracle as well. The "export 
or die" mentality, critics said, led both nations to dump products abroad to 
win market share while protecting their home turfs with all sorts of trade 
barriers. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, a look at the economic strategies of both nations shows differences 
as well as similarities in their paths to becoming postwar trade giants. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, South Korean officials say Japan served as their biggest role model in 
pushing what was largely an agrarian economy into today's world-class producer 
of ships, semiconductors and automobiles.  
</P>
<P>
 "We just followed the Japanese model instinctively," recalled Kyong Shik Kang, 
economics minister under former presidents Park Chung Hee and Chun Doo Hwan. 
"They are our nearest neighbors, and we frequently visited Japan." 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes, Kyong said, Korean officials followed Japan a bit too blindly. Even 
after the oil shock in the early 1970s, South Korea continued to try to build 
up its chemical industry, though the highly inflated oil prices made it 
unprofitable to do so. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "People thought, 'Japan built up its petrochemical industry, and since we are 
at a similar stage we have to do it.' It was a foolish mistake," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 For both nations, the start was similar. Both South Korea and Japan face the 
same geographical fate: They are located in areas lacking oil, mineral riches 
and other natural resources crucial for industrialization. Both nations, 
exhausted by war, also faced shortages of hard currency. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, both nations chose a similar basic strategy to build up national 
wealth: Export products abroad, earn foreign currency and use that to buy the 
resources needed to further develop industries. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the beginning, we didn't have much foreign exchange, so we couldn't 
aggressively import or open our markets," said Nam Sam Woo, a senior fellow at 
the Korea Development Institute. "All we could do was push hard with exports 
and, with those proceeds, import a lot of raw materials and machinery needed 
for domestic production. Given the resources at the time, it was the right 
choice." 
</P>
<P>
 Both nations also took similar paths in choosing products to export. 
Initially, top exports were silk, fish products, textiles and other primary 
commodities. As industrialization proceeded, however, manufactured goods 
emerged as the dominant export. In 1962, for instance, primary commodities made 
up 73% of South Korea's total exports, but that figure dropped to 10% by 1974 
and 5% by 1987, according to government statistics. 
</P>
<P>
 Capitalizing on their relatively low labor costs, both nations began moving 
into light industry, such as clothing, plywood and footwear. And, in both 
cases, discriminatory wage policies toward women helped keep labor costs low. 
In 1980, for instance, the gender wage gap was larger in South Korea -- women 
earned 44.5% of men's pay -- than in any other country providing data to the 
International Labor Organization; the dubious distinction fell to Japan in some 
years, such as 1984. 
</P>
<P>
 As average wages increased, however, planners had to scramble to develop 
products with ever higher value. That meant shifting to products requiring more 
capital and technology, such as computers, semiconductors and the like. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In both cases, government officials played strong roles in planning and 
controlling the growth. The South Korean government, for instance, used tax 
breaks, regulations and its control over credit allocation and exchange rates 
to push Korean business to develop specific industries, expand production and 
increase export capacity. 
</P>
<P>
 Both countries also relied on what Harvard Prof. Tu Wei-ming calls "new 
Confucian ethics" to support the industrialization drive. According to Tu and 
others, such ethics place an emphasis on education, government leadership, 
consensus and a strong work ethic. But unlike traditional Confucianism, which 
disdained merchants as money-grubbers and placed them on the bottom of the 
social ladder below scholars, farmers and artisans, the "new" ethics glorified 
business activities and the entrepreneurial spirit. 
</P>
<P>
 The result in both countries, analysts say, was a pool of highly educated and 
well-trained workers who viewed their firms as a family bound by mutual 
obligations and loyalty. 
</P>
<P>
 But the two nations also differed in their approaches. One major distinction 
was that Japan largely financed its growth with its own pool of savings, while 
South Korea depended heavily on foreign borrowing.  
</P>
<P>
 Japan also developed a fairly good balance between large conglomerates and 
small and medium-sized enterprises, while South Korea's development was spurred 
almost exclusively by the large business groupings, the conglomerates known as 
chaebol , said KDI's Nam.  
</P>
<P>
 While the chaebols ' large scale has enabled South Korea to undertake such 
massive enterprises as shipbuilding and overseas construction, it has also led 
to a greater concentration of industry than in Japan. That, in turn, has led to 
some economic inefficiency -- chaebols are never permitted to go bankrupt -- as 
well as mounting social protests. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts say another major difference was the role that military concerns 
played in shaping the economy. Japan renounced war and downgraded its military 
to defensive forces after its World War II defeat, and for most of its 
high-growth period it spent less than 1% of its gross national product on 
defense. 
</P>
<P>
 South Korea, however, lives under the shadow of heavily armed North Korea and 
spends 5% or more of its gross national product on defense. Military concerns 
have also shaped the direction of industrial development. After President 
Richard Nixon withdrew one-third of U.S. forces in South Korea and President 
Jimmy Carter proposed removing them entirely in the 1970s, a nervous South 
Korea began building up defense-related industries, such as shipbuilding, said 
Kyong, the former economics minister. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 All of these policies and conditions have brought relative prosperity to South 
Koreans, who now have an average per capita income of $7,000, compared to less 
than $100 in 1969.  
</P>
<P>
 But the "export or die" mentality that boosted South Korea and Japan into 
today's trading giants may be a policy whose time has past. As the world moves 
toward an open trading system in the post-Cold War era, the formula of 
exporting abroad while protecting one's home market is not likely to be 
tolerated.  
</P>
<P>
 That reality is all too painful in South Korea, where President Kim Young Sam 
battles to open his nation's markets in the new order of global liberalization 
even as he faces the old order of Stalinist North Korea. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now we face many difficulties," Kyong said. "We should become cosmopolitan 
and adjust to the post-Cold War world. But on the Korean Peninsula, the Cold 
War continues."

 Forget about Santa's elves and all the other Northern Hemisphere mythology in 
toy making. The toy makers are not found in the North Pole but in China's 
steamy Guangdong province across the border from Hong Kong. 
</P>
<P>
 This is where more than 60% of the world's toys are manufactured before being 
shipped out through Hong Kong to overseas stores. More than 300,000 people are 
employed in the $9-billion toy-making business there. 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent day at the Qualidux Toy Factory in Guangdong's Heng Gang district, 
about an hour's drive from the Hong Kong border, workers were busy making 
Mighty Morphin Power Rangers . . . and puzzles, miniature Jersey cows and 
plastic gifts for both McDonald's and Burger King. 
</P>
<P>
 A typical toy maker, explain e d Y. S. Wong, who employs 6,000 of them at the 
Qualidux Toy Factory he manages, is a woman, 18 to 23 years old, from one of 
China's impoverished interior provinces such as Sichuan, Hunan or Jiangxi. 
</P>
<P>
 The toy manufacturers pay fees to provincial authorities to recruit the young 
women, usually the second or third children in farming families, and load them 
onto buses for the southern coast. 
</P>
<P>
 To start, they are paid about 280 yuan a month, around $40. In addition, they 
receive free housing (eight women to a room), food and uniforms. Most of the 
women are able to send about half of their salaries home to their families. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost to a person, their goal is to save enough money making toys in five 
years to return home and get married with a decent nest egg to start a family. 
</P>
<P>
 Qin Tinzhen, 18, operates the No. 44 injection-molding machine at the Qualidux 
factory. Her machine makes red plastic toy truck cabs for an American company. 
She said she came to Guangdong from her home in distant Sichuan province, where 
her father is a rice farmer, when she was 16. Her first job was in an optical 
company. 
</P>
<P>
 "I heard from neighbors in Sichuan that there were good jobs here," she said 
as she held up one of her red truck cabs. 
</P>
<P>
 Told that her product might someday make it all the way to the United States, 
she beamed with pleasure, a pink ribbon bobbing in her hair. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought I was making toys for Hong Kong," she said. Rone Tempest, Times

 When the "Star Wars" craze was raging in the United States, Dennis Ting's 
companies produced R2-D2 plastic figurines -- 80 million of them. Cabbage Patch 
Dolls? Ten million of the stuffed creatures. Mighty Morphin Power Rangers -- 
Jason, Trini, Zach, Kimberly, Billy? Ting makes jillions of them along with 
disgusting plastic things called Burp Balls, anti-gravity toy cars that drive 
on the ceiling and Susie Scribbles, a near life-size doll who sits at a desk 
and "can write anything she says." 
</P>
<P>
 The showroom in his Kowloon headquarters is a child's delight and a parent's 
nightmare of large and small plastic toys. 
</P>
<P>
 Ting, cherubic and constantly grinning during an interview in his spacious 
office decorated with equally cherubic Buddhist sculpture, is one of the Hong 
Kong toy tycoons. His products, manufactured just across the border in China, 
are a $9-billion-a-year business and dominate the world's toy market. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the Toy Manufacturers of America, more than 60% of all toys, 
dolls, games and Christmas decorations are made in China and enter the U.S. 
market via the Hong Kong connection. 
</P>
<P>
 Ting, chairman of the board of Kader Holdings Co. Ltd. and managing director 
of Qualidux Industrial Co. Ltd., two of Hong Kong's largest toy manufacturers, 
entered the business in the early 1950s after emigrating to Hong Kong with his 
family from his native Shanghai. 
</P>
<P>
 In Shanghai, the family had manufactured dry-cell batteries and brass 
flashlights. But after seeing the waterproof plastic flashlights carried by 
American GI's who arrived in Shanghai after World War II, the family envisioned 
a future made of plastic. 
</P>
<P>
 In Hong Kong, their first foray into plastic production met with failure after 
molds they ordered from the United States, for the manufacture of chopsticks 
and hair combs, did not work. 
</P>
<P>
 But Ting, educated in the United States at Colby College in Maine, said the 
setback was a blessing because it forced the family into the business of making 
its own molds. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon they were producing the chassis for toy plastic cars and the plastic 
fixtures for Lionel trains. Gradually, Hong Kong replaced Japan as the world's 
leading manufacturing center for toys. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1980, facing an increasingly expensive Hong Kong labor market, Ting and all 
of the other Hong Kong toy makers began moving their manufacturing operations 
across the border to China, in the "special economic zone" created in Shenzhen 
by the Chinese government. 
</P>
<P>
 Ting's two companies have 15,000 employees in China. Overall, Hong Kong toy 
makers with plants in China employ an estimated 300,000 workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Often conditions in factories that make American children's playthings are not 
pleasant or safe. In Thailand, for instance, Ting's Kader Holdings was 
half-owner of a Bangkok toy factory that collapsed and burned last year, 
killing 240 workers. 
</P>
<P>
 But Ting said his companies' Chinese factories are all made of concrete to 
prevent such a tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have regular fire drills, three firefighters on staff," he said. Rone

 You may not know Kim Woo Choong and the Daewoo industrial conglomerate he 
heads. But you probably know his products: Caterpillar forklifts, sections of 
Boeing jetliners, Leading Edge computers. 
</P>
<P>
 As South Korea's first major exporter, the globe-trotting entrepreneur built 
his $34-billion conglomerate on the back of international trade. 
</P>
<P>
 From his first venture selling tricot yarn to Singapore after establishing 
Daewoo in 1967, Kim has expanded his industrial empire to 23 major companies, 
South Korea's third-largest conglomerate. He makes refrigerators in China, 
garments in Myanmar, videocassette recorders in Northern Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
 He ships cars to Czechoslovakia and owns a microchip plant in Silicon Valley. 
He even builds schools in Libya and railway lines in Iran -- during the height 
of the Iran-Iraq War. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can smell money everywhere," says Kim, 57, in his best-selling biography. 
</P>
<P>
 That hunger and drive was shaped by the hardships of the Korean War, Kim says. 
</P>
<P>
 At age 14, he was left to fend for his mother and two siblings when his father 
was seized by North Korean soldiers. In his hometown of Taegu, he hustled for 
money selling newspapers, racing to push them into the hands of people and 
backtrack later to collect the money. He outsold his rivals 10 to 1. 
</P>
<P>
 A graduate in economics from Yonsei University, Kim started Daewoo (Great 
Universe) as a trading firm with five employees and $10,000. He started with 
textiles and got a big break when he gambled on a new type of rayon developed 
by Mitsubishi of Japan. He guessed that shirts made from the fabric would be a 
hit in the United States. They were. He earned $6 million in three years. 
</P>
<P>
 One of his most celebrated coups came in 1976, when he revived a state-owned 
heavy machinery plant at the request of then-President Park Chung Hee. The 
plant had been losing money for 37 years. Kim turned it around in nine months 
by slashing costs, building employee housing to boost morale and driving up 
productivity. 
</P>
<P>
 He worked a similar miracle with state-owned Okpo shipyard, which he was asked 
to take over in 1978 and which finally turned a profit in the last two years. 
The feat earned him the nickname Midas. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Kim has his sights set on Daewoo's auto business. He declared this year 
that his "last duty" to the group will be to make Daewoo Motors one of the 
world's top 10 auto makers. 
</P>
<P>
 His detractors view him as somewhat reckless, driven by a blind desire for 
nearly any business opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
 He admitted that his life is not balanced; he's never played golf or attended 
a concert or theater show in his life. He spends more than 200 days abroad and 
has never taken a vacation except the morning of his daughter's wedding. 
</P>
<P>
 Even today, he prowls the floor of Daewoo Motors most nights looking for 
defects. Teresa Watanabe, Times Staff Writer

 Minoru (Jack) Murofushi, president of Itochu Corp., made an offbeat request 
last January in his annual New Year's speech to staff: He asked the huge 
trading firm's employees to clean their desks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't simply clear out unwanted items . . . but instead take a more radical 
approach," he urged. "Empty the contents of your desk onto the floor, and then 
pick out only those things which will be useful in bringing profits in the 
future." 
</P>
<P>
 Itochu itself -- known outside Japan until 1992 as C. Itoh & Co. Ltd. -- would 
take the same approach, Murofushi, 62, declared. 
</P>
<P>
 "A 'scrap and build' mentality is required," he explained. "We should free up 
resources by scrapping unproductive projects, and then invest those resources 
in new and profitable areas." 
</P>
<P>
 Murofushi's demanding vision is rooted in a belief that Itochu -- one of the 
biggest firms in the world in terms of sales -- is positioned to prosper 
despite fierce competition and a lingering recession. 
</P>
<P>
 He exudes not only optimism but the easygoing manner of someone who has 
absorbed much from many years of work in the United States, where the business 
culture is far more casual than in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 He joined the firm in 1956, immediately after graduating with a bachelor's 
degree in law from Tokyo University, the most prestigious school in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 "At that time, I had no idea what a trading company was. I just wanted to see 
the world. I know in many countries people joined the armed forces for that 
purpose, but in Japan in those days that was not an option," Murofushi said 
with a touch of deadpan humor in a speech to the Foreign Correspondents Club of 
Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 At the age of 31, Murofushi was sent to Itochu's New York office, where he 
spent the next 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
 During this time he developed a comfortable familiarity with the English 
language and U.S. culture that is still rare among the very top level of 
Japanese corporate leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 "Working in America gave me a new perspective on life," he said. "It's a 
country that is both open and fair. In America, if a person has ability, then 
he can get ahead regardless of background or age." 
</P>
<P>
 Murofushi became president and chief executive of Itochu in 1990, and since 
that time has become increasingly prominent as a spokesman for Japan's business 
community. David Holley, Times Staff Writer

LEADERS HAVE PROSPERED BY KNOWING WHEN TO MAKE THEIR MOVES.; Y.F. CHANG, 67, 
TAIWANESE SHIPPING MAGNATE  
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 According to the official company biography, the spectacular career of 
billionaire shipping magnat Y.F. Chang is a classic Horatio Alger tale with an 
Asian twist. 
</P>
<P>
 The son of a poor carpenter and his wife living in Taiwan under Japanese 
occupation, Chang graduated from Taipei Commercial High School and went to work 
as an apprentice sailor on Japanese shipping lines. 
</P>
<P>
 After rising through the ranks to captain, Chang in 1968 bought a secondhand 
tramp freighter that launched his shipping business. 
</P>
<P>
 Today his Evergreen Group owns one of the largest container shipping fleets in 
the world, with 74 vessels at sea. Evergreen also owns EVA Airways, a rapidly 
expanding international carrier, as well as hotels and heavy industrial plants. 
</P>
<P>
 Forbes Magazine has listed Chang's personal wealth at more than $2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 "More than half my success is due to my experience at sea," Chang once told an 
interviewer. "Only people who start low and push to the top can survive." 
</P>
<P>
 But Chang's "push" to the top also has been assisted by several factors not 
normally mentioned in the official biographies. 
</P>
<P>
 The first was his marriage to the daughter of the owner of the Japanese 
shipping line where he worked. The second, very possibly related to the first, 
was his longtime business relationship with the Japanese Marubeni trading 
house. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Chang speaks the Taiwanese Chinese dialect, he is more comfortable 
speaking Japanese learned in school during the occupation. 
</P>
<P>
 This fluency helped him with Japanese business connections. Marubeni lent him 
the money to buy his first ship and more money to repair it after it was 
damaged in a collision. 
</P>
<P>
 Although it has never been confirmed, many people believe that Marubeni was 
the source of the more than $1 billion in loans Chang obtained between 1982 and 
1984 to buy 24 ships needed to launch his global transport service. 
</P>
<P>
 The only black spot on the Evergreen record came in August, 1993, when company 
officials admitted making $172,000 in illegal campaign contributions to more 
than 20 California politicians, including Gov. Pete Wilson and U.S. Sen. Dianne 
Feinstein. To atone for the illegal contributions, Evergreen's U.S. subsidiary 
agreed to pay $895,000 in penalties, the largest fine of its type in U.S. 
history. Rone Tempest, Times Staff Writer

 People in Hong Kong call him chiu yan , or Superman. Li Ka-shing is easily the 
British colony's most admired man. 
</P>
<P>
 He is also the fourth-richest person in Asia behind the Sultan of Brunei and 
Japanese property tycoons Minoru Mori and Toichi Takenaka. 
</P>
<P>
 He has a business empire that straddles the globe, from oil fields in Canada 
to a telecommunications network in Britain, to container terminals in southern 
China. His personal wealth has been estimated at $3.5 billion, according to 
Forbes. 
</P>
<P>
 Born in China, Li has a network of powerful allies. He quit school at age 14 
when his schoolteacher father died. With a mother, younger brother and sister 
to support, the young Li started off selling plastic flowers and watchbands. 
</P>
<P>
 But by 1950, Li had made his first million and opened his own plastics 
factory. Five years later he set up Cheung Kong (Holdings) Ltd., now one of 
Hong Kong's leading property development and investment holding companies. 
</P>
<P>
 A turning point in Li's fortunes came in 1979, when the Hong Kong Bank sold 
him its 22.8% stake in Hutchison Whampoa Ltd., enabling Li to become the first 
Chinese to control one of five traditionally British hongs, or British-owned 
trading houses, in Hong Kong. 
</P>
<P>
 Li, whose sights are set firmly on China, was appointed in June, 1993, as a 
working committee member of the Preparatory Committee for the Hong Kong Special 
Administrative Region. The Hong Kong SAR's future hinges on Beijing's adherence 
to a "one country, two systems" formula, which promises that the colony can 
maintain its freewheeling economic and social system for at least 50 years 
after 1997, when Hong Kong reverts to Chinese sovereignty. Christine Courtney,

<P>
 Shortly after the start of the Iran-Iraq War in the early 1980s, Phaiboon 
Kuonsongtum found himself in a taxi roaring across the desert from Amman, 
Jordan, to Baghdad. One of Thailand's leading rice traders, Phaiboon opted for 
the ground transport when commercial flights were grounded by the fighting. 
</P>
<P>
 "Business was waiting," he recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 Phaiboon pioneered sales of Thai rice to the Middle East, which now accounts 
for about 40% of the half a million metric tons that Phaiboon's firm, the 
Chaiyaporn Rice Co., exports each year. 
</P>
<P>
 Those exports, worth about $100 million, account for about 10% of Thailand's 
total annual rice exports, making Phaiboon's company one of the top traders in 
a country that has long dominated world rice trade, fighting for first place 
with the United States in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 Phaiboon's company, which he owns with his brother and another ethnic Chinese 
family, is privately held, and profits are kept a closely held secret. 
</P>
<P>
 The future for Thai rice is "quite alarming," Phaiboon said. "The cost of 
paddy production here is no longer competitive compared with Vietnam or Burma, 
so the only way for us is to concentrate on higher-quality rice." 
</P>
<P>
 But even this will extend the country's competitive position for only another 
five or 10 years. So Phaiboon is already looking to transform his 
43,000-square-meter warehouse and private jetty into a consumer goods 
distribution hub for department stores. 
</P>
<P>
 Diversifying from rice is a cautious step for a family that has been in the 
business for three generations. 
</P>
<P>
 Phaiboon's grandparents were part of the large emigration from the chaotic 
Chinese mainland in the 1920s. The children were the first in the family to 
focus exclusively on rice exports, mainly to Hong Kong and Singapore. It was 
left to Phaiboon and his older brother, who founded their company in 1968, to 
develop the rest of the world as a market. Ken Stier, Special to The Times

 Somchai Kokratae, a day laborer at Bangkok's main port, wonders when or 
whether Thailand's growing prosperity will begin to trickle down. 
</P>
<P>
 Kokratae lives in one of the slums that surround the city, and each dawn he 
seeks work at the Klong Toey wharves. 
</P>
<P>
 When there is work, he is paid up to $4 an hour, enough for Kokratae and his 
wife to subsist if no medical emergencies arise. 
</P>
<P>
 Kokratae, 37, helps load Thailand's export goods onto ships from other parts 
of Asia, Europe and the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 But while the country's foreign trade is expanding, Kokratae complains that 
endemic corruption in the military-dominated shipping industry is siphoning off 
profits for a privileged elite, who in turn allow common workers to fend for 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 He says that he sometimes handles toxic chemicals while loading or unloading 
carriers and that few employers provide worker's compensation or health 
insurance for the injured. 
</P>
<P>
 On nights when he is not working, Kokratae seeks refuge in the makeshift bars 
whose lights twinkle throughout the Bangkok slums. 
</P>
<P>
 Over "Mekong Cokes," mixed with a cheap, local booze, Kokratae talks about 
escaping from the wharves, about saving enough to someday open a small shop 
outside the city. 
</P>
<P>
 And then he slips back to his home to rest before returning to the docks. Ken

<P>
 Among the wonders of the Chinese capital is the warren of clothing stalls 
surrounding Beijing's Ritan Park that locals call the Russian Clothing Market. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason for the name is fairly straightforward: Most of the customers of 
the 1,300 market stalls selling bulk quantities of Chinese-made clothing are 
Russians. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point last year, said Vasily Yefimov, a Moscow University graduate in 
economics who arranges tours and air-freight forwarding services for Russian 
clothing buyers, his company was running 50 charter flights and 20 cargo 
flights a month between Beijing and Russian cities. 
</P>
<P>
 The Russians shop in Beijing because the quality of clothing made in China is 
vastly superior to that of Russian-made clothing. To meet the demand, many of 
the Chinese shopkeepers have learned to speak Russian. Many signs are in both 
Chinese characters and Russian Cyrillic script. 
</P>
<P>
 Yang Lingquo, 44, sold fruit in the market before the Russian trade began to 
grow explosively a few years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 When he saw how much money others were making selling brightly colored nylon 
jackets to Russians, Yang decided to jump into the rag trade, specializing in 
acrylic sweaters manufactured in Fujian province. 
</P>
<P>
 Yang lives only a few minutes' walk from the market. He pays only $2 a month 
rent for a two-room apartment, which he shares with his wife and 14-year-old 
son. The apartment is subsidized by his work unit, a wholesale drug company 
that sells to hospitals and drugstores.

 Yang is supposed to work 44 hours a week at that job. The license for the 
stall is actually in his mother's name, and his three brothers and a sister 
take turns working in the stall.

 Yang likes doing business with the Russians but warns against trying to cheat 
them:

 "The Russians' intellectual/cultural level is much higher than that of the 
Chinese. One of every five Russians has a university education, whereas only 
one out of several hundred Chinese has one." Elisabeth Grinspoon, Special to

PACIFIC RIM TRADE; PROFILES; MILLIONS OF ENGINES REV UP THE ASIAN ECONOMY; TO

 Beatles classics boomed over the stereo system at Shop & Shop Marukin as 
Shinji Kikuchi explained why he enjoys his job selling American T-shirts, 
sports shoes and other imported casual wear. 
</P>
<P>
 "From my childhood, I didn't like the idea of working from 9 to 5 wearing a 
tie," said Kikuchi, 36, bearded, long-haired and wearing a Grateful Dead 
T-shirt. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw how my father worked as an ordinary company employee, and I didn't 
think it would fit for me. . . . I liked this kind of atmosphere since my 
junior high school days. Because I have a lot of contact with young people in 
this job, I feel like I can keep myself young too." 
</P>
<P>
 Not too worried about career-building, Kikuchi has held a string of jobs since 
high school, mostly as a salesclerk. This has left him the flexibility to make 
half a dozen trips to Hawaii and San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 He is a "big fan" of the Grateful Dead and likes San Francisco partly for its 
music scene, he said. He is single, earns about $32,000 a year and spends 
one-quarter of his income to rent a one-room apartment. 
</P>
<P>
 The shop where Kikuchi works is one of dozens of stores, selling everything 
from Italian suits to American candy bars, crammed into the Ameyoko Center in 
Tokyo's bustling Okachimachi district. 
</P>
<P>
 Ameyoko was a multinational center specializing in food and U.S. Army surplus 
goods in the early post-World War II years. After a fire years ago, it was 
rebuilt to house trendy import shops. 
</P>
<P>
 Overseas travel has made more people realize that foreign goods are usually 
sold at huge markups in Japan, and this knowledge, combined with the strength 
of the yen, is beginning to help push prices down, Kikuchi said. 
</P>
<P>
 "However much our salaries are large in U.S. dollars," he said, "in real life 
you don't feel that things are cheap." David Holley, Times Staff Writer

BODY WATCH; Q & A WITH KENNETH COOPER; THE FITNESS DOCTOR IS IN; YOU MAY NOT 
RECOGNIZE THE NAME, BUT YOU'VE GOT TO BE FAMILIAR WITH HIS BABY: AEROBICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Never mind that Dr. Kenneth Cooper has written 11 health and fitness books, 
selling more than 30 million copies in 41 languages. 
</P>
<P>
 Or that he founded the Cooper Aerobics Center and the affiliated Cooper 
Institute for Aerobics Research in Dallas, known worldwide for its exercise 
studies. 
</P>
<P>
 Or that he coined the word aerobics in 1968 when his landmark book, 
"Aerobics," was published. 
</P>
<P>
 Mention his name, and the response is often, "Kenneth who?" 
</P>
<P>
 At 63, the tall and lanky Cooper -- "the father of aerobics" -- is too busy to 
care. While preparing for yet another trip abroad to educate the masses, he 
took a breather to talk about our health habits, his career, the 
disease-fighting potential of antioxidant vitamins and his weakness for sweets. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Question: Although you've been writing health and fitness books since 1968, a 
lot of people, even serious exercisers, don't know your name. Does that 
surprise you? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: No, not really. I would say realistically I'm better known throughout 
the world than in the United States and for one reason: the Cooper test. That 
is a 12-minute (fitness) test which has been picked up by military 
organizations and schools and now it is the official test for soccer players 
throughout the world and for referees. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though I created the word (aerobics) in 1968, it wasn't until 1975 when 
Jane Fonda comes along and starts popularizing aerobics and everybody thinks 
aerobic dancing -- which is only one of 31 aerobic exercises -- is exclusively 
aerobics. 
</P>
<P>
 What we decided to do in the early days . . . was to get such a scientific 
base that no one could argue with our ideas. The (Cooper) Institute is doing 
three things: researching, working with corporations and organizations all over 
the world to help establish fitness and wellness programs for their employees, 
and (conducting) continuing education. We trained over 4,000 people last year. 
The work is just what I want it to be. I couldn't care less about notoriety and 
people knowing my name. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: If you had to give Americans a fitness grade, what would we get today? 
</P>
<P>
 A: C-minus. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: And what did we have five years ago? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Probably a C-plus. Maybe a B-minus. We reached our peak in 1984. We had 59% 
of Americans claiming to be exercising aerobically. Now that realistically is 
probably 25% or 30%. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Where do you see us going? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I think we're beginning to see a resurgence. There was a study (unpublished 
as yet) looking at a road race. They started following people in 1980 and found 
by 1990 only 55% were still running. But of interest, 85% were still 
exercising. 
</P>
<P>
 We're finding people are transitioning to other types of exercise when they 
find they can't run anymore because of musculoskeletal problems or they get 
bored with it. So I think moderation is going to be the key to the future.  
</P>
<P>
 If so, that means if you go out and cover two miles in 30 minutes and do that 
three times a week, you get almost the same benefit as you get from running 
three miles five days a week if your goals are health and longevity.  
</P>
<P>
 Q: What do you run a week, mileage-wise? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Twelve to 15. But let me elaborate. We did a study . . . published (in the 
Journal of the American Medical Assn. in which) we found walking at a 12-minute 
per mile pace is the equivalent of running at a nine-minute per mile pace and 
you have one-tenth the injury problem. So I am running about half the time now. 
I've been doing a lot of aerobic walking, two or three miles at a time. I'll 
probably average 3 1/2 days a week running, 2 1/2 days of aerobic walking. 
</P>
<P>
 I get home, have a light evening meal and then about 10 o'clock take my two 
dogs for a walk. I (also) work out with weights for 20 minutes, two to three 
times a week. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: In light of the recent popcorn study (pointing out the high fat content of 
most movie theater popcorn), what do you eat for snack food? 
</P>
<P>
 A: My wife, Millie, makes air-popped popcorn, and we've been on that for a 
long time. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What's your biggest dietary sin? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Chocolate chip cookies. When I sit on the airplane, riding first-class, and 
you can smell those chocolate chip cookies . . . I have them with skim milk. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: If you could tell couch potatoes one way to get motivated, what would it 
be? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Get a dog. Kind of strange, I know. But Paul Dudley White (the late 
physician to President Dwight D. Eisenhower) once said everyone should take 
their dog for a walk whether they have one or not. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Your 12th book, "Dr. Kenneth H. Cooper's Antioxidant Revolution," is due 
out this fall. Recently, in the New England Journal of Medicine researchers 
found that the antioxidant Vitamin E did not reduce the incidence of lung 
cancer and that beta carotene may raise the risk. What are your thoughts? 
</P>
<P>
 A: (The subjects) had been smoking for 36 years, a pack a day. And they were 
50 to 69 years of age when they entered the study. There's a very good chance 
(that) a lot of those guys already had cancer. The only thing that study shows 
is if you put people on that dose of Vitamin E and beta carotene and they are a 
high risk patient to have lung cancer, it's not going to help them. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What's your personal regimen of antioxidants? 
</P>
<P>
 A: The "antioxidant cocktail" -- 1,000 of Vitamin C, preferably 500 milligrams 
twice a day; 400 International Units of natural Vitamin E and 25,000 units of 
beta carotene. So it takes me four tablets a day. . . . In the book I've 
adjusted it according to weight and sex, age and physical activity -- if you go 
up to 30 miles per week (of running), that's fine, but you need to increase 
antioxidants. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Will you ever stop running? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I doubt it. I want to enjoy life to the fullest right up to the last moment 
and then die suddenly. And I think exercise gives me the best chance for doing 
it.
