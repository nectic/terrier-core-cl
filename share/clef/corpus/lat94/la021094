 Lender Agrees to Help Lower-Income Borrowers: Fleet Financial Group Inc., 
attempting to resolve an extended controversy about its lending practices, 
plans to announce an $8.5-billion lending program for low-income and 
moderate-income borrowers, sources familiar with the agreement said. Fleet said 
the impetus for the agreement is a desire to resolve persistent questions about 
its mortgage lending practices. The bank is attempting to minimize opposition 
to its merger plans, according to attorneys who have followed the company.

 Bergen Adopts Anti-Takeover Plan: Drug distributor Bergen Brunswig Corp., 
preparing to streamline its stock ownership and voting rights, said it has 
adopted a shareholders' rights plan to ward off hostile parties that might try 
to take over the company. The plan, a common corporate provision that most 
major companies already have, was part of Bergen's decision in 1989 to abolish 
its dual system of stock ownership and voting that gave the founding Martini 
brothers effective control of the company. No one, however, is trying to take 
over the nation's largest supplier of pharmaceuticals to hospitals and managed 
care facilities, say corporate officials and industry analysts.

 Aetna Posts Record Loss: Aetna Life & Casualty Co. reported its biggest 
quarterly loss in company history, after taking a $1.03-billion charge to cut 
4,000 jobs and drop two product lines. The nation's fourth-largest insurer said 
its fourth-quarter loss was widened to $1.13 billion, or $10.09 a share, from a 
loss of $191.9 million, or $1.74, a year earlier. Core earnings before the 
charge and investment gains jumped to $142.9 million from $600,000, benefiting 
from lower expenses and fewer catastrophe losses.

DOW UP SHARPLY AS INVESTORS SEEM TO REGAIN CONFIDENCE

 Market Overview 
</P>
<P>
 * Blue-chip stocks closed sharply higher Wednesday as investors returned to 
the market with greater confidence after last week's plunge of nearly 100 
points in the Dow Jones industrial index. 
</P>
<P>
 * Treasury bond yields declined for the first time in five sessions, aided by 
a note auction that drew good demand despite the Federal Reserve Board's move 
last week to boost interest rates. Stocks  
</P>
<P>
 The Dow Jones industrial average was up 25.89 points to end at 3,931.92. In 
the broader market, advances led declines 1,274 to 844 on New York Stock 
Exchange volume of more than 332 million shares. 
</P>
<P>
 Gains in economically sensitive cyclical stocks such as Alcoa and Caterpillar 
boosted the Dow. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said the market's strength masked concern that Friday's producer 
price index data could bring a new round of selling, if the inflation numbers 
are higher than expected. 
</P>
<P>
 They noted investors were encouraged by the market's ability to rebound from 
last Friday's headlong drop of 96 points, sparked by the Fed's hike in 
short-term interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're beginning to put two and two together -- that whatever happened 
Friday was an aberration," said William LeFevre, senior market analyst at 
Ehrenkrantz King Nussbaum. 
</P>
<P>
 But some traders said the trauma from Friday's market decline had not been 
completely forgotten. 
</P>
<P>
 "The investment climate has become a little more nervous as the result of 
Friday's move," said Gerry Simmons, head of institutional trading at 
Interstate/Johnson Lane. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the trading highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Cyclical stocks gained ground, with Alcoa up 1 1/8 to 80 1/2, AlliedSignal 
up 2 1/2 to 79 7/8 and Caterpillar up 7/8 at 108 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * The jump in the Dow was also helped by strength in Sears, up 1 1/4 to 49, 
and Procter & Gamble, up 2 1/4 to 59 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
 * WMX Technologies fell 3 1/4 to 25 after the environmental services company 
reported fourth-quarter results that were below Wall Street expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 * USAir slipped 5/8 to 13 1/2. CS First Boston downgraded its rating on the 
stock to hold from buy and slashed its earnings forecasts, citing the airline's 
new, low fares. 
</P>
<P>
 * Ford reported fourth-quarter earnings that were slightly above analyst 
forecasts, but its shares dropped 1 to 68 1/2. A J.P. Morgan analyst said 
Ford's income from operations was not as robust as some on Wall Street were 
expecting. 
</P>
<P>
 In overseas trading, London's Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100 index ended 
down 11.1 at 3,429.1. In Frankfurt, the German DAX index ended at 2,085.29, 
down 21.92 points or 1.04%. In Tokyo, the Nikkei average fell 409.85 points to 
19,841.38. Credit  
</P>
<P>
 The market's positive reaction to the second part of the Treasury's quarterly 
refunding this week reassured some investors that the bond selloff triggered by 
the Fed credit tightening may have subsided. 
</P>
<P>
 The yield on the Treasury's main 30-year bond fell to 6.40% from 6.45% late 
Tuesday. Its price, which moves in the opposite direction, rose 9/16 point, or 
$5.63 per $1,000 in face value.  
</P>
<P>
 The Treasury sold $12 billion in 10-year notes at an average yield of 5.92%, 
near expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 The bid-to-cover ratio, a measure of auction demand comparing number of bids 
offered to those accepted, was 2.58-to-1. Analysts said that was about even 
with an average 2.61-to-1 ratio for 10-year note auctions in the past three 
years. Currency  
</P>
<P>
 The dollar was mostly lower in foreign exchange trading Wednesday as investors 
sold to capture profits from its recent strength, but the U.S. currency kept 
rising against the faltering British pound. 
</P>
<P>
 In New York, the pound finished at $1.4615, cheaper than $1.4665 a day 
earlier. The dollar ended at 108.35 yen, down from 108.65 yen on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Other dollar rates in New York compared to late Tuesday: 1.7590 German marks, 
down from 1.7635; 1.4765 Swiss francs, down from 1.4805, and 1.3423 Canadian 
dollars, down from 1.3425. Commodities  
</P>
<P>
 Oil futures fell sharply on the New York Mercantile Exchange after weekly 
reports from the American Petroleum Institute and the Department of Energy 
showed unexpected increases in U.S. crude oil stocks. 
</P>
<P>
 March light, sweet crude oil tumbled 61 cents to $14.60 a barrel; March 
heating oil fell 1.17 cents to 49.40 cents a gallon.

 The Harding Watch: Figure skater Tonya Harding, who has avoided talking to TV 
reporters, once even filming them with her own video camera while wearing a "No 
Comment" T-shirt, turns up on two different interview shows tonight. Although 
CBS began running promo ads Tuesday night saying Connie Chung had landed the 
"first" interview with the embattled Harding, it appeared the first in-depth 
Q&A would actually go to correspondent Joel Loy of "Inside Edition," which airs 
a two-part interview with Harding from her hometown of Portland, Ore., tonight 
and Friday (7 p.m. on KCAL-TV Channel 9). At 10 p.m., Harding will be on a 
special edition of "Eye to Eye With Connie Chung" to "tell her side of the 
story" about the scandal surrounding the attack on rival skater Nancy Kerrigan. 
On Wednesday, Chung's executive producer, Andrew Heyward, discounted "Inside 
Edition," saying: "The network newsmagazines as a group are superior 
journalistically to the so-called tabloid programs. . . . Connie Chung will do 
a stronger, more insightful interview."

 Harding, Part II: Meanwhile, cable's Comedy Central plans to air "Spunk: The 
Tonya Harding Story," a special "Bad Girls" edition of its "Short Attention 
Span Theater," at 8 and 11 p.m. on Feb. 22. "At a full five minutes, we think 
the movie gives the story all the attention it deserves," said Comedy Central's 
Ken Olshansky, who is in charge of the production. Look-alike skaters who want 
to try out for the roles of Harding or Kerrigan can do so Monday morning at New 
York's Rivergate Ice Rink.

 22 Stations Bar Vicki: Following on the heels of ABC's reported hesitancy to 
air an upcoming "Roseanne" episode in which Rosie kisses another woman, 
Tuesday's edition of Vicki Lawrence's syndicated talk show "Vicki!" was pulled 
by 22 stations that objected to the host showing off her "boobs." The body 
parts involved, however, weren't real but were in the form of a plastic 
Halloween prop, which Lawrence wore in a comedic segment. Said Lawrence: "I'm a 
comedian, and this was a joke. There's a dreadful double-standard at work here. 
. . . You can wave around John Bobbitt's penis on the news. When the subject is 
serious, it's OK. But when you treat these things comedically, you're in 
trouble." KCAL-TV Channel 9, where "Vicki!" airs locally, showed the program in 
its entirety.

 Cable Additions: America's Talking, the first all-talk cable network, has 
moved its launch date up to July 4. The NBC-owned channel will premiere with 14 
hours of live talk programming daily. Meanwhile, the channel is still searching 
nationwide for an unknown talk-show host; those interested in the job can call 
(800) 988-TALK for details. . . . Turner Classic Movies, a new cable channel 
offering commercial-free presentations of classic movies, will launch April 14 
at 4 p.m. with what it's billing as the first "uninterrupted, commercial-free 
presentation" of the 1939 epic "Gone With the Wind." MOVIES

 Bugs Bunny Creator Returns: Chuck Jones, the animator who created such famed 
cartoon characters as Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck and Porky Pig, is returning to 
Warner Bros., the studio he helped make famous. Jones, 81, a three-time Academy 
Award winner, will create new animated works starring his classic characters 
and may also create new characters for future films. "Chuck Jones is a vital 
part of Warner Bros.' history, as essential as Bogart, Cagney, Bette Davis and 
'Casablanca,' " said Warner Chairman Robert A. Daly, in announcing Jones' 
return. POP/ROCK

 Country Newcomer Tops Sales: Following in the footsteps of country singer 
Garth Brooks, Nashville newcomer John Michael Montgomery's "Kickin' It Up" sold 
an impressive 109,000 copies last week to lasso the No. 1 position on the 
nation's pop album chart. Montgomery, whose album and current single "I Swear" 
also dominate the country charts, sold 12,000 units more last week than his 
closest competitor, pop diva Mariah Carey. Other surprises: Alternative-rock 
group Counting Crows' album "August and Everything After" leaps to No. 10, 
selling 70,000 units last week, while Tori Amos' new "Under the Pink" enters at 
No. 12, selling about 65,000 units.

 No Disguise Needed: Eric Clapton may be recognizable to most pop fans, but not 
to everyone. The Rev. Dennis Ackroyd of the tiny parish church of Ewhurst, 
England, recently noticed a guitar inside the home of one of his parishioners 
and asked the house's owner if he would play in the church. When the man 
agreed, Ackroyd told him: "Good! I'll give you a couple of months to practice." 
An embarrassed Ackroyd realized later that the man was rock star Clapton, who 
thrilled the congregation when he turned up at the church to play such hymns as 
"Amazing Grace."

 Streisand Ads Disputed: Barbra Streisand's camp is warning that ads in several 
United Kingdom newspapers offering tickets for purported Streisand concerts 
there in November are bogus -- no such dates have been set, the singer's 
spokesman says. The ads requested written ticket applications, accompanied by a 
check. An announcement of real Streisand concert dates is expected soon. SHAUNA

 Ten years ago, on a Saturday afternoon near Gordy's Cafe in Starbuck, Minn. 
(pop. 1,200), nine men got together to make lefse. Not just ordinary lefse , 
but the world's largest -- a paper-thin 9-foot, 8-inch-by-9-foot, 1-inch deluxe 
flatbread -- big enough to get their masterpiece listed in the Schibsted 
Norwegian Book of Records. "The Guinness Book," says participant Ron Lindquist, 
"claimed they didn't have a category." 
</P>
<P>
 Lefse is traditionally made at holidays and other special occasions, and many 
Norwegians here consider lefse almost as big a deal as a trip to Oslo. 
Non-Norwegians aren't as impressed -- some have been spotted at annual Lutheran 
Church lutefisk (lye-soaked and steamed cod) suppers unfolding the lefse and 
placing it on their laps as napkins. 
</P>
<P>
 At the record breaker in Starbuck, more than 4,000 people turned up to witness 
the event, including the Pillsbury Doughboy, who supplied the 30 pounds of 
instant potatoes it took to make the giant flatbread. "Everyone wanted to get 
in on the act," says Lindquist. 
</P>
<P>
 But that's potato, or southern-style, lefse. In Norway, there are at least 50 
kinds -- almost every district has its own recipe for lefse and most do not 
include potatoes. Hardanger , or west coast lefse , is made from lard dissolved 
in milk, sugar, salt and flour. It keeps practically forever and no 
refrigeration is needed. When you want to eat it, you simply dip it in water, 
let the excess drip off and let it rest between towels or waxed paper until 
it's soft and pliable. Northern Norwegians prefer the richer krinalefse 
(decorated) made with eggs, buttermilk and whipping cream, or mor (tender) 
lefse made with eggs, sour cream, and corn syrup. 
</P>
<P>
 There's even a lefse made with yeast. "When I was teaching," says Bitten 
Norvoll, "a lady told me about it. When I told her I never heard of it, she 
says, 'Yeah, I'll bring you some.' And it was really good, but I kind of stick 
to northern lefse, the one without the potato." 
</P>
<P>
 All lefse has to be rolled paper-thin ( lefse means flat in Norwegian). It's 
easier if you use a specially carved lefse rolling pin that has grooves in it, 
available at Scandinavian shops. " Lefse is not short like pie crust," says 
Norvoll, "so the grooves help to spread the dough faster." Norvoll also 
recommends making the lefse one day and refrigerating it overnight. "Anyone can 
make lefse ," says Norvoll. "Just don't make them too big." 
</P>
<P>
 Even the lefse makers from Starbuck might grudgingly agree.  
</P>
<P>
 Since the giant lefse was created, many have tried without success to break 
that record. In fact, the Norwegian record holders have tried -- and failed -- 
to create a larger lefse . At some point down the road they plan to try again. 
For now, they are content to wait until their record is broken. "We tried a 
couple of times," says Lindquist. "But there's no sense in breaking our backs 
over it." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Lefse sticks are available at Scandinavian shops, but you can also use a 
spatula. Lefse makers also use a round board for rolling with a custom-fitted 
pastry cloth, but a dish towel on top of a counter top works fine. Also lefse 
rolling pins have grooves to prevent sticking, but many people improvise by 
using a smooth pin covered with a sock. All equipment is available through mail 
from Maid of Scandinavia, 3244 Raleigh Ave., Minneapolis, Minn. 55416. (800) 
328-6722.

 The traditional way to eat lefse is to spread each round with butter, sprinkle 
on some white sugar, and then roll or fold into fourths. POTATO LEFSE 
</P>
<P>
 2 1/2 pounds russet potatoes, peeled 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 cup butter 
</P>
<P>
 2 tablespoons sugar 
</P>
<P>
 1 tablespoon salt 
</P>
<P>
 1 1/2 cups flour 
</P>
<P>
 In pot boil peeled potatoes. Drain thoroughly and press through ricer or food 
mill while still warm. Should make about 5 cups. Cool to room temperature. 
</P>
<P>
 Add butter, sugar and salt. Knead flour into dough, bit at time, adding just 
enough to be able to roll out thin. Remove 1/3-cup portion and refrigerate 
rest.  
</P>
<P>
 Using floured lefse rolling pin or rolling pin with fabric sleeve, roll out 
dough on floured pastry cloth to 6- to 7-inch diameter. Slide lefse stick or 
long spatula underneath and turn dough over. This will prevent sticking. 
Continue rolling until round is 14 to 16 inches in diameter. Slip lefse stick 
or spatula under rolled dough and transfer to grill heated to 500 degrees and 
oiled. Cook 35 to 40 seconds or until bubbles begin to form. Flip and grill 
until medium-brown spots appear.  
</P>
<P>
 Transfer lefse to towel using lefse stick. Cover with another towel to prevent 
drying, then let cool. Repeat until all remaining dough is used. Fold finished 
rounds in half and then in half again to store. Makes 10 lefse. 
</P>
<P>
 Each lefse contains about:

</P>
<P>
 1 tablespoon grated lemon zest 
</P>
<P>
 5 to 7 cups flour 
</P>
<P>
 Filling 
</P>
<P>
 Mix eggs, sugar, buttermilk, butter, whipping cream, baking soda and lemon 
zest in large mixing bowl. Knead enough flour into dough to be able to roll out 
thin. Remove 1/3-cup portion and refrigerate rest. 
</P>
<P>
 Using floured lefse rolling pin or rolling pin with fabric sleeve, roll out 
dough on floured pastry cloth to 6- to 7-inch diameter. Pierce rounds of lefse 
with fork to create design. Slide lefse stick or long spatula underneath and 
turn dough over. This will prevent sticking.  
</P>
<P>
 Continue rolling until round is 14 to 16 inches in diameter. Slip lefse stick 
or spatula under rolled dough and transfer to grill heated to 500 degrees and 
oiled. Cook 35 to 40 seconds or until bubbles begin to form. Flip and grill 
until medium-brown spots appear. Transfer lefse to towel using lefse stick. 
Cover with another towel to prevent drying and cool. Repeat until all remaining 
dough is used. When cool, spread Filling between 2 rounds. Cut into eighths. 
Makes about 80 pieces.

<P>
 On a recent winter morning, when the temperature is double digits below zero 
and the streets are waist-high in shimmery, silver snow, Bergliot Norvoll's 
south Minneapolis kitchen is warm and fragrant from bread baking. She takes a 
quick peek at the loaves in the oven and talks about life, lefse and lutefisk.  
</P>
<P>
 Norvoll, who is nicknamed Bitten ("They think Bergliot is a man, you know") 
was raised in Narvik, a Norwegian seaport about 150 miles north of the Arctic 
Circle, where women once spent days traveling from home to home making rounds 
of lefse -- a flatbread that resembles a flour tortilla -- for the fishermen of 
the house. Each man provided his own food on the boat, and the lefse was 
stacked in steamer trunks along with other provisions and lugged on board to be 
rationed while at sea. The fishing was good back when Norvoll was a girl, and 
the men always arrived home with plenty of catch left over to feed their 
families. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't until she married Torbjorn Norvoll in 1950 that she seriously 
considered moving to America. By then the couple was living in Oslo and things 
had not yet gotten back to normal after wartime occupation by the Nazis. Food 
was still scarce and there was a tremendous housing shortage. "We had just 
married and would have had to wait for at least two years to get an apartment," 
says Norvoll, "so we figured we'd come to America for a short time, make a pile 
of money and then come back home." 
</P>
<P>
 The couple first settled in the small town of Fosston, Minn., where it was 
even colder than Norway and where Torbjorn had an uncle who owned a bakery. The 
Norvolls weren't alone. So many Norwegians have migrated to Minnesota that the 
state now has a staffed Norwegian consulate. (A Canadian consulate is the only 
other one in Minnesota.) Norvoll, who had spent a year at hotel school and then 
another year at husmor (housewife's) school in Norway, helped with the baking. 
It wasn't long before they realized they were never going to get rich. About 
the same time, it dawned on them that they wanted to stay here.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 That's when they moved to Minneapolis, where Norvoll got a job cooking at 
Northwest Airlines. "Airline food was much better then," she says. "We made 
everything from scratch in Northwest's kitchens. I remember one day we roasted 
15 turkeys." 
</P>
<P>
 To supplement her income, Norvoll also catered on weekends and taught 
Norwegian cooking classes at the Minneapolis Technical Institute. "I'm just 
kind of an ambitious person," she says, "and working keeps you healthy." 
</P>
<P>
 And what exactly is Norwegian food? Even those with Scandinavian roots have 
trouble differentiating between Swedish and Norwegian cuisines. Because of 
their close proximity, the growing seasons and climates are much the same. It's 
all white food, right? 
</P>
<P>
 "The crops are pretty much the same," says Norvoll, "but each country has its 
own tradition. For instance, though many pastry shapes and tools are the same, 
and most Scandinavians use a lot of cardamom, Norvoll says that Norwegians tend 
to use a lot more almond flavoring. 
</P>
<P>
 And while Swedes and Norwegians share a love for lutefisk (lewd-uh-fisk) -- 
the translucent rubbery dish created by soaking cod in salt and then in a 
solution of lye -- only in Norway is it typically steamed and then slathered in 
butter. In Sweden, the fish is served in a cream sauce. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "I love it," says Norvoll. "My grandfather used to make it all the time, and 
so do I." Her husband, however, was not a fan of the fish. "He had never eaten 
lutefisk before he came (to the U. S.)," says Norvoll. "Whenever I would make 
it, he would wrinkle his nose and say, 'In Norway we had good fish.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Norvoll is retired now, and her husband has passed away. Yet she is busier 
than ever. "Sometimes it's a bit too much," she says, shaking her head as she 
is reminded of her hectic social life, most of which seems to center around 
activities with Norwegian groups. On sub-zero winter mornings, when it's too 
cold to be outdoors for more than a few minutes, you'll find Norvoll walking 
the corridors of Mall of America with other members of a Norwegian hiking club. 
She also belongs to several other Norwegian clubs, including Sons of Norway. 
</P>
<P>
 Lefse and seafood still play a part in her life. She regularly turns out at 
least three kinds of lefse and prepares fish several times a week. "Whenever 
anyone comes to my house to eat, they expect seafood," she says. "Only nowadays 
fish tastes merely OK." It's just not as tasty as what she used to eat when 
growing up in Norway.  
</P>
<P>
 Norvoll also loves to bake. "Decorating is my cup of tea," she says. "My 
grandchildren don't think it's their birthday unless I make them blotkake 
(Norwegian birthday cake)." She makes all her own bread and thinks nothing of 
getting out her krumkake iron to make the fancy, thin roll-up cookies, or maybe 
whip up a batch of hjortebakkels (Norwegian doughnuts). "When you make fresh 
doughnuts," she says, "there really isn't anything better." 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe that's why there's always someone dropping by for a chat, endless cups 
of coffee and a little lunch. (In Minnesota, lunch is eaten at least three 
times a day: before dinner (what most Southern Californians consider lunch), 
after dinner and after the evening supper.) 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "In Norway we went to each other's houses all the time for coffee or whatever, 
just to get together," Norvoll says. "Then we came here and found other 
Norwegians and just kind of grouped together." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Hjortebakkels are smaller and richer than American cake doughnuts. "Your 
doughnuts have too much sugar, too much vanilla," moans Norvoll. "Oh, vanilla, 
you don't find a cookie here unless it has vanilla in it." NORWEGIAN CAKE

 Norvoll, who watches her diet, swears by this high-fiber bread. She often 
brings a loaf with her to Sons of Norway get-togethers. "I think it's important 
to cook healthy," she says. "People here don't diet, they just talk about it."

COUNTER INTELLIGENCE: DIMPLE DINING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN GOLD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 So far in 1994 I have eaten a kangaroo filet with fried eggplant, a scoop of 
black-truffle ice cream, and an eel salad that resembled a Louise Nevelson. But 
one of the oddest dishes may well have been the seafood curry at Indra, a 
mini-mall Thai-Chinese restaurant a few blocks down from Glendale High. 
</P>
<P>
 The curry came on a large, superheated terra-cotta platter, streaked with 
dun-colored sauce, decorated with an assortment of chessman-size clay fetishes 
that resembled primitive nuclear cooling towers. When a waitress first set it 
down on the table, it was difficult to decide whether to look for the food or 
to figure out how to gamble with the thing -- I sort of instinctively looked 
for a pair of dice. Each cooling tower concealed a dimple on the platter, sort 
of a half-golf-ball indentation. In the dimples, extremely minimal, slightly 
overcooked portions of mixed shellfish -- a shrimp, half a mussel, a scrap of 
squid -- seethed in tiny puddles of coconut curry. You would probably find the 
sauce extremely spicy if you could manage to spoon out more than a few drops at 
a time. 
</P>
<P>
 Indra has pretty much everything you look for in a neighborhood Thai 
restaurant, which is to say fairly good chicken-coconut soup, a few oddball 
regional dishes that will impress your friends, and an owner who looks the 
other way when you bring your own beer. The clientele seems to be about half 
Thai, half other (this eastern edge of Glendale is as rich in Armenians and 
Cubans as it is in youngish would-be Ozzies and Harriets), meaning that most of 
the cooking is not only authentic but accessible. There is a wide assortment of 
homemade Thai desserts, including alarming-looking green coconut things and 
fresh Thai dessert crepes whenever somebody feels like making them. If you live 
in the area, Indra even delivers. 
</P>
<P>
 Green-papaya salad is spicy and fresh; Indian-curry noodles are rich; stuffed 
chicken wings are fried crisp in their coating of eggy batter. There is an 
intense, herbal smoked-pork-innard soup with rice-noodle sheets wrapped into 
tight candle shapes that rivals the best Malaysian-Chinese noodle soups; it's 
called "noodle sheet, browny soup." There are crisp, luscious mussel omelets 
fried with taro and chile, and there are overcooked stir-fried beef dishes of 
every description. 
</P>
<P>
 But essentially, Indra, a clean, basic place decorated with travel posters and 
dominated by a glass-front hot-food counter that sits just inside the front 
door functions as a Thai curry house, a steam-table takeout joint where for a 
few dollars you get a plate of rice and a stew or two to ladle over it. This 
style of restaurant is common in Bangkok, but fairly rare here -- and Indra has 
the best Thai curry house food I've had since Renoo's burned down in the '92 
riots. 
</P>
<P>
 Here you'll find chicken legs simmered in a thick peanut-butter curry, fish 
balls in a yellow curry, slices of catfish fried with chile and Thai basil, 
crumbles of ground pork that have been fried crisp with chile. Sometimes there 
is har mok , coconut-moistened seafood steamed in a little bamboo basket, which 
may be prettier than it is delicious but is worth getting anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 If strips of beef in a brick-colored coconut curry or chicken in a 
bamboo-shoot curry are tougher than usual, it is because they have given their 
all to the sauce, which after all has to flavor a vast quantity of rice . . . 
sometimes it seems as if the curries here act more as condiments than as dishes 
in their own right. If you listen to the government guys who put together the 
food-group pyramid, meat is supposed to be a condiment anyway.

THE OLYMPIC SPIRIT 
</P>

<P>
By COLMAN ANDREWS

<TEXT>
<P>
 One of my fondest restaurant memories from earlier days of dining around Los 
Angeles is a scene (oft-repeated) at the now-defunct Scandia. I'm settled into 
one of those tall, broad, dark-red leather wing chairs at a table in the bar, 
beginning a dinner with friends. Later, we'll investigate the excellent, 
reasonably priced wine list and eat good salmon or hearty meat of some kind -- 
but for now our food and drink is something simpler, if also somehow more 
exotic: We begin, almost inevitably, with the restaurant's famous assortment of 
herring, five or six kinds in different preparations; with this comes a basket 
of various Scandinavian-style breads, mostly dark or medium-dark, some salty 
and some sweet. 
</P>
<P>
 And to drink, there is really only one possibility: Shots of Aalborg Akvavit 
from Denmark, served in heavy little glasses, poured from a napkin-wrapped 
bottle frozen in a cylinder of cloudy ice. Strong, straightforward, 
crystal-clear, flavored with an earthy note of caraway and so cold that it has 
slowed to an almost syrupy consistency, it is all but irresistible -- and it is 
impossible to imagine any other liquid simultaneously complementing and 
offsetting the delicious herring so effectively. 
</P>
<P>
 More than once since Scandia's demise, while sitting down in some more 
gastronomically current local eatery to yet another goat-cheese pizza or 
rib-eye steak and yet another bottle of Chianti Classico or Central Coast Syrah 
(much as I enjoy those things), I have thought with some longing of that 
particular combination of food and drink -- a combination now so resolutely 
untrendy (and difficult to come by, at least in Los Angeles). 
</P>
<P>
 More than once, I've gone down to my local German deli for herring -- not 
Scandia's, but not bad -- and bought a bottle of Aalborg or some other aquavit. 
Not often enough, now that I come to think about it -- but more than once. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 What is aquavit, exactly? (The Swedes and Norwegians spell it thus; in Danish, 
it's "akvavit.") The easy answer is that it's a spirit distilled from grain 
and/or potatoes, usually in Scandinavia (though some is made in Germany) and 
usually with flavor added. Caraway is the most common accent, at least in 
examples of the stuff exported to the U.S., but there are also aquavits infused 
with elderberry, coriander, dill, sweet myrtle gale, licorice, bog-myrtle, 
bitter oranges and other citrus fruits, even Madeira wine. (The British writer 
Giles McDonogh has described one Swedish variety, called Ahus Bitters, as 
tasting "like the entire contents of the spice box macerated in alcohol.") The 
name derives from the Latin term "aqua vitae" or "water of life" -- which is 
what the first distilled spirits were supposedly dubbed by Arnaud de Vilanova, 
the 16th-Century Spanish physician and scientist who is usually credited with 
introducing the Arab art of distillation into Europe. (The French term "eau de 
vie," which usually refers specifically to clear fruit brandies, means the same 
thing.) The first aquavit officially made in Scandinavia seems to have been a 
product of the Royal Danish Distillery, established in 1555 by King Christian 
III. 
</P>
<P>
 The definition of aquavit gets slightly complicated, though, when you try to 
draw the line between it and other spirits popular in northern climes. The term 
"schnapps," for instance, is widely used in Germany, Switzerland and 
Scandinavia (the Danish say "snaps") to mean any sort of more-or-less neutral 
spirits, flavored or otherwise. Aalborg Akvavit, for instance. Then there's 
"brannvin," a term used similarly in Sweden. (Like the Dutch word "brandewijn," 
from which we derive the word "brandy," it means "burnt wine.") The famous 
Swedish vodka Absolut, for instance, began life in 1879 as a product called 
"Absolut Renadt Brannvin" -- which might be translated as "absolutely pure 
schnapps" -- said to have been distilled 10 times. However, when the Swedish 
government's alcohol monopoly launched Absolut's descendant as an international 
brand in 1979, they labeled it vodka. Fair enough, I suppose -- but I'm not at 
all sure that the flavored versions of Absolut, one infused with spicy chiles, 
the other with "citron" (a mix of citrus essences), mightn't be described quite 
accurately as aquavits themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the aquavit sold in America today comes from Denmark or Sweden -- 
though there is one prominent Norwegian brand available. The most famous -- and 
most commonly found -- is the aforementioned Aalborg, from Denmark. Aalborg is 
also the name of a city in North Jutland, site of the Danske Spritfabrikker or 
Danish Spirit Factory, which produces all of that nation's aquavit. At least a 
dozen varieties of the spirit are made there. What we know simply as Aalborg is 
called Taffel or Red Taffel in Denmark. Jubilaeum, another aquavit found on 
these shores, is also distilled in Aalborg. 
</P>
<P>
 The most prominent Swedish brands in the United States are O.P. Anderson and 
Skane. The Norwegian entry is Linie, which is the smoothest of the lot, aged in 
old oak sherry barrels and shipped in casks on an ocean voyage across the 
Equator before bottling. ("Linie" means "line.") The motion of the ship 
supposedly helps it age more rapidly and wears off the rough edges. (Certain 
kinds of sherry were traditionally treated in the same way; anything marked 
"India," for instance, has theoretically been shipped from Spain to that 
country and back.) 
</P>
<P>
 Some people like aquavit at room temperature. To me -- my Scandia 
conditioning, I'm sure -- the colder it is the better. (I once figured out how 
to encase a bottle in ice, incidentally: Cut the top off a half-gallon milk 
carton, place the bottle inside and fill the carton with water. Freeze it, then 
peel the carton away and shape the remaining ice into a cylinder with hot 
water.) And, though I have to admit that I'm sipping a bit of very chilly 
Norwegian Linie by itself right now as I finish this piece late on a rainy 
evening, I also think that aquavit shows itself best, by far, with food -- 
preferably oily fish of some kind (eel, smoked salmon, herring of course) or 
various other smorgasbord/ smorrebrod treats. The tableside ritual for drinking 
aquavit, incidentally -- memorably illustrated in a series of photographs 
starring Swedish actor Max von Sydow in the Time/Life Foods of the World volume 
on "The Cooking of Scandinavia" -- is to engage your drinking partner's gaze; 
tip your head (and glass) backward, draining the aquavit in a single swallow; 
then return your head (and glass) to their original position and look your 
partner straight in the eye again. 
</P>
<P>
 One other way of drinking aquavit is as a spike for coffee. The old way of 
blending java and schnapps was to place a silver coin in the bottom of an empty 
coffee cup, pour in enough coffee to obscure the coin, and then add aquavit 
until you see it again. If Scandia had served breakfast, I'm sure I'd have 
nostalgic thoughts for this preparation as well. TASTING NOTES 
</P>
<P>
 DENMARK 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Aalborg Akvavit ($16.50). Pure, clean, delicious -- with a pronounced 
character of caraway. A good introduction to the genre (and a nostalgic 
favorite for me). 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Jubilaeum Akvavit ($13.25). An aggressively contemporary package -- triangular 
bottle, kicky wraparound label with contempo graphics -- and a strong citrus 
aroma and flavor (mostly oranges, it seems to me). The books say Jubilaeum is 
flavored primarily with coriander and dill. If those elements are present here, 
they are faint -- and I wonder if the marketing arm of Dansk Spritfabrikker 
hasn't just borrowed the name for an export product aimed, perhaps, at 
capturing the Absolut Citron drinker. SWEDEN 
</P>
<P>
 O.P. Anderson Aquavit ($13.95). A lovely, subtle aquavit with a complex nose 
suggesting vanilla and something herbaceous. The color is that of an oaky 
Chardonnay, and the mildly woody aftertaste almost reminds me of a very light 
Scotch whisky. Superb. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Skane Aquavit ($15.25). The charms of this one are lost on me. Caraway and 
anise seem to color both the aroma and the flavor, but there just isn't much to 
it, and the aftertaste is slightly bitter. NORWAY 
</P>
<P>
 Linie Aquavit ($19.50). Very smooth, the color of fino sherry, with lots of 
caraway in the nose and a vaguely fruity finish. Not at all unpleasant to sip 
by itself. (According to the books, each bottle of Linie is supposed to bear 
the name of the ship on which its lot crossed the Equator and the date on which 
the deed was done, but I can't find either piece of information on my bottle, 
so perhaps this is a refinement that has been lost.)

WINE: YOUNG WINES BUILT TOUGH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN BERGER, TIMES WINE WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When the waiter arrives at your table with that Cabernet Sauvignon you ordered 
and the bottle is relaxing on its side, nestled in a silver wire basket, can 
you be sure he didn't flip the bottle three times over his head before laying 
it in its cradle? 
</P>
<P>
 And could you tell the difference if he had? 
</P>
<P>
 Wine is believed to be a very fragile thing. Snooty collectors swear all wines 
have to be stored on their sides (to keep the corks moist) at precisely 54 
degrees with a humidity of 77.34%, and that any light or vibration is death. 
They claim that any heat at all ruins the wine. They say they can tell if you 
cared for it properly -- ideally, I suppose, by keeping it resting in its 
original wooden case, top still nailed shut, underneath your house, preferably 
covered by a mound of earth. 
</P>
<P>
 Bosh, I say. Wine is a heck of a lot sturdier than that. Coddling it may make 
you feel better, but likely as not, most wine isn't going to spoil if you leave 
it on the kitchen counter for three days, or three weeks, or even mistreat it 
for a day or two. In fact, some torture might actually help a young wine. 
</P>
<P>
 Not long ago I tried a test that shocked 16 experienced tasters. I took a 
bottle of a fine 1989 Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon and put it in the trunk of 
my car. I left it there for five weeks, driving all over the county during one 
of the hottest parts of the summer.  
</P>
<P>
 Finally, I pulled the wine out of the trunk and placed it alongside another 
bottle of the same wine that had been resting on its side in my wine cellar, 
unmoved, undisturbed from its 60-degree home. A week later, I placed both wines 
in brown paper bags, removed the foil capsules and the corks, and replaced the 
branded corks with blanks, so the tasters would have no clue what was up. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I then poured the wine for the 16 and asked only one question: Which wine do 
you like better? Everyone said the wines were very close in aroma, and almost 
identical in taste, but 12 of the 16 preferred the bottle that spent its summer 
vacation just north of my transaxle. 
</P>
<P>
 Why? I suspect that this wine, being very young and tannic, needed to be 
handled roughly if it was to be appreciated so early in life. The wine clearly 
was made to be aged for a long time, and one way to accelerate its aging a bit 
and make it more approachable was to beat it up. 
</P>
<P>
 Obviously, I'm not suggesting that everyone store young red wines in car 
trunks, but this little exercise was one bit of evidence that wine is far less 
fragile than some people think. 
</P>
<P>
 Most young wine benefits from some aeration, so another way to make a young 
wine taste better is to splash it roughly into a decanter or water pitcher and 
give it the air that will help open up the aroma. 
</P>
<P>
 I was convinced of this the other day after evaluating a group of 1992 Pinot 
Noirs. Many of the wines were so young (most had been bottled only months 
earlier) they lacked the aroma and character I knew they should have. So after 
the formal part of the tasting, I dumped the best of them into decanters and 
allowed them to sit for an hour. 
</P>
<P>
 Tasting them again, I found two of the wines, both rather inexpensive, had 
improved markedly. Some of the more expensive wines also were improved, but not 
as much.  
</P>
<P>
 The wine I felt improved the most was the 1992 Napa Ridge Pinot Noir, which 
has a suggested retail price of $7 but is occasionally discounted to below $6. 
The initial aroma had been mildly interesting with a bit of cherry and some 
simple flavors -- a quaffable little wine. With aeration, however, the wine 
showed more complexity and actually took on what seemed to be better body. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Many people worry not only about overheating wine but about freezing it. Take 
the case of the mysterious floating stuff. 
</P>
<P>
 A reader once wrote that when she forgot to chill a white wine for a dinner 
party she tossed it into the freezer 90 minutes before the guests arrived. That 
was too long -- when she was ready to serve the wine, it was frozen nearly 
solid. Some time later, with most of the bottle thawed, she noticed stuff 
floating around in the wine, and she thought the wine had been spoiled. She 
asked what to do. 
</P>
<P>
 The answer was: Drink around them. The floating stuff was tartrates, which are 
naturally, but invisibly, present in wine. Most wineries these days chill wine 
before bottling specifically to cause these tartrates to crystallize, so they 
can be filtered out of the wine. The only reason to do this is that if the 
tartrates are left in, some can eventually crystallize in the bottle and buyers 
might then complain about the "glass" they found in their wine. 
</P>
<P>
 This woman had apparently found a winery that doesn't chill its wines. But the 
crystals are harmless and nearly tasteless, so when she feared her frozen wine 
would be spoiled, she was only partly right. She could drink the wine, but the 
crystals are no fun to taste. Otherwise, a bottle of wine that has been frozen 
is not generally spoiled, nor will most people notice much of a difference -- 
unless they try to drink it while it is still frozen. 
</P>
<P>
 One thing you should avoid is standing a bottle of wine in bright light, 
especially ultraviolet light. White wine bottled in clear glass (the bottle 
companies call this color "flint") are susceptible to getting a light-struck 
character, which smells skunky, like burnt matchsticks. In this sense, light 
can be far more detrimental than temperature. 
</P>
<P>
 The worst temperature damage comes from fluctuation, which can harm wine 
badly. If you walk into a liquor store in winter and are warmed by its heater 
and then months later you revel in its wonderful air conditioning, beware the 
wine storage. 
</P>
<P>
 Old wine, of course, is a different matter. It is fragile and should be 
protected from any changes in its storage. It doesn't have the constitution to 
ward off the changes that are certain to occur from bad storage. 
</P>
<P>
 But young wine is far more resilient. So don't worry about that bottle of 
Cabernet you left in the trunk for two days. It'll be fine.

GOOD COOKING: BE MY LAMB

<P>
 Most romantic celebrations seem destined for restaurants. We all live such 
busy lives these days that romance at the table appears more feasible away from 
home. 
</P>
<P>
 But there is much to be said about intimate dining at home. More than the 
meaningful ritual of preparing a wonderful meal for someone special, consider 
the civilized pleasures of sitting at your own table in quiet candle-lit 
surroundings while enjoying the food and wine at your own deliberate pace. 
Sounds like a perfect Valentine's Day celebration to me. 
</P>
<P>
 The following festive menu was designed to lure busy cooks back home for 
Valentine's Day. Created for preparation and cooking in well under an hour, the 
menu includes grilled or broiled herbed lamb chops served on a mixed green 
salad, with tomatoey simmered white beans and raspberry jubilee sundaes. 
Because the salad is part of the dinner itself, there's little need to go back 
and forth to the kitchen, one thing that can detract from the joys of dining at 
home. 
</P>
<P>
 The rest of the menu is carry-in: cooked shrimp, cocktail sauce, crusty 
baguettes and crisp buttery wafers to serve with the dessert. And remember to 
pick up a good wine, maybe a California Cabernet Sauvignon, to share with your 
valentine. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Hot herbed lamb chops served on a chilled salad of mixed arugula, Bibb lettuce 
and fresh basil leaves make an elegant presentation that is also full of flavor 
and interesting contrasts.  
</P>
<P>
 GRILLED HERBED LAMB CHOPS ON MIXED GREENS 
</P>
<P>
 1 large clove garlic, minced 
</P>
<P>
 1 teaspoon crushed dried rosemary 
</P>
<P>
 1 teaspoon ground thyme 
</P>
<P>
 1 teaspoon sugar 
</P>
<P>
 Scant 1/2 teaspoon salt 
</P>
<P>
 Freshly ground pepper 
</P>
<P>
 2 teaspoons olive oil 
</P>
<P>
 4 loin lamb chops, 1 1/2 inches thick, well trimmed 
</P>
<P>
 3 cups loosely packed greens, mix of trimmed arugula leaves, Bibb lettuce and 
basil, rinsed, chilled 
</P>
<P>
 6 Kalamata olives, flesh cut in fine julienne 
</P>
<P>
 Balsamic Honey-Mustard Dressing 
</P>
<P>
 Mix garlic, rosemary, thyme, sugar, salt, pepper and oil in small dish. Rub on 
both sides of chops. Set aside at room temperature about 30 minutes. Grill or 
broil chops approximately 4 minutes per side, or until done as desired. 
</P>
<P>
 Toss greens and olives in salad bowl with Balsamic Honey-Mustard Dressing. 
Adjust seasonings to taste.  
</P>
<P>
 To serve, place salad on 2 dinner plates, arranging attractively to 1 side of 
plate. Arrange 2 lamb chops on each salad. Serve immediately. Makes 2 servings.

 Fresh and sun-dried tomatoes together bring out the flavor of these beans. The 
kind of sun-dried tomatoes that require soaking in hot water to soften them 
have the best flavor for this dish. The idea is to heat the beans quickly so 
they don't become mushy. The dish goes well with the grilled lamb chops.  
</P>
<P>
 SIMMERED WHITE BEANS WITH TOMATOES 
</P>
<P>
 1 tablespoon olive oil 
</P>
<P>
 1 large clove garlic, minced

</P>
<P>
 6 sun-dried tomato halves softened in 1/3 cup hot water, cut into 1/4-inch 
dice, soaking liquid reserved 
</P>
<P>
 1 (15-ounce) can Great Northern beans, rinsed in cold water and well-drained 
</P>
<P>
 2 ripe plum tomatoes, peeled, seeded and cut in 1/4-inch dice 
</P>
<P>
 1/8 teaspoon salt 
</P>
<P>
 Freshly ground pepper

<TEXT>
<P>
 In our family, roast chicken for Sunday dinner is almost an article of faith. 
I truly think it's one of nature's perfect foods. It's crisp. It smells good. 
It goes with red wine. Most importantly, it fits the rhythm of the week, 
providing a pause between the rush of the weekend and the rush of the workweek 
-- a kind of tasty coda before Monday morning, when the whole thing starts over 
again. 
</P>
<P>
 But every once in a while you need to shake things up. Do something really 
radical. Last weekend -- get this -- I boiled the chicken. Yeah, maybe it was 
reckless, but it tasted good. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, it's interesting to compare the two chickens -- roasted and boiled. 
Both have essentially the same components: chicken with vegetables and a 
starch. But the overall effect is quite different. 
</P>
<P>
 With roast chicken, the flavors are well delineated. The potatoes taste like 
potatoes, by gosh, and the chicken like chicken (provided you buy the right 
kind. I hate to seem too chauvinistic, but I firmly believe California-bred 
birds are distinctly better than their Southern factory cousins). 
</P>
<P>
 Boil the bird and the effect is different. The lines of flavor are blurred, 
even though the vegetables served with the soup are cooked separately and not 
combined until the last minute. Because the chicken is stewed with carrots, 
leeks and onions, it picks up some of their aromatic qualities. And because the 
second set of vegetables gets a final bath in a very enriched chicken stock, 
there is a certain poultry-ness to them. 
</P>
<P>
 Call it the Impressionist version of chicken dinner vs. the Primitivist. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 You can also call this a poule au pot , if you are of a French frame of mind, 
though classically that is a more complicated meal -- boiled with beef and 
sausages as well, with the meat carved at the table and served separately from 
the stock, which is bulked up with noodles as a first course. This could be 
called a boiled dinner although, at the opposite extreme, a boiled dinner 
usually seems to connote a kind of mean and mingy meal of chicken and 
vegetables cooked together for reasons of economy -- Pilgrim food. 
</P>
<P>
 This is someplace in between, clean and delicate since the serving vegetables 
are cooked separately, but complex as well. Actually, I have come to use this 
method whenever I'm cooking things like boiled dinners or stews. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, some people will look at this recipe and see that the first few 
vegetables -- those cooked with the chicken -- are discarded and they will say 
they are wasted. They will see that the rest of the vegetables are cooked 
separately before serving and they will say it takes too much trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 They are welcome to their opinions, but I wish they would try it this way just 
once. The first vegetables give up their flavors in service to the broth -- the 
intrinsic bond that makes the whole dish work. At the same time, cooking the 
second set of vegetables individually emphasizes their separateness, keeping 
the final result from being a muddy mush of flavors. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, that is exactly what happened when I reheated the dish the next day 
with the chicken and vegetables together -- the green flavor of the sugar snap 
peas overwhelmed the stock. What once had been a lovely, delicate broth had 
become heavy and hard without a lick of subtlety. 
</P>
<P>
 And that's the last thing you need before facing a week of work. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 There are a few things to notice about this recipe. The first is that though 
two chickens are cooked, only one is eaten. The second chicken is a freebie 
leftover -- perfect for eating cold or for shredding for soups, enchiladas . . 
. whatever. Secondly, cooking the mushrooms using the method described below -- 
in a very hot, dry pan -- concentrates their flavor wonderfully. Finally, feel 
free to adjust the serving vegetables to fit your whim. I like this combination 
for right now, when sugar snap peas are good, but it would be just as delicious 
with shelled peas. Or you could combine carrots, peas and potatoes. Leeks would 
be nice. So would pearl onions. What the heck, do what you like.  
</P>
<P>
 BOILED CHICKEN AND THEN SOME 
</P>
<P>
 1 leek, trimmed and cleaned 
</P>
<P>
 2 cloves garlic 
</P>
<P>
 1 onion, quartered 
</P>
<P>
 1/4 parsnip 
</P>
<P>
 3 carrots 
</P>
<P>
 1 stalk celery 
</P>
<P>
 Parsley stems 
</P>
<P>
 2 bay leaves 
</P>
<P>
 2 (3 1/2-pound) chickens, quartered 
</P>
<P>
 2 cups white wine 
</P>
<P>
 2 cups chicken stock 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 pound new potatoes, quartered 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 pound sugar snap peas, trimmed and stringed 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 pound brown mushrooms, trimmed and wiped clean 
</P>
<P>
 Chopped parsley 
</P>
<P>
 Coarse-grain sea salt 
</P>
<P>
 Place leek, garlic, onion, parsnip, carrots, celery, parsley stems and bay 
leaves in bottom of large soup pot. It is not necessary to chop them. Place 
chicken pieces on top of vegetables, breasts on 1 side, leg quarters on other. 
Pour wine and stock over, then enough water to barely cover chicken. 
</P>
<P>
 Bring to simmer over medium heat. Maintain bare simmer, using flame-tamer if 
necessary, 1 hour. 
</P>
<P>
 While chicken is cooking, boil or steam new potatoes until barely soft, about 
20 minutes. Boil or steam sugar snap peas in pod until bright green but still 
crisp, about 5 minutes. In non-stick pan over very high heat, cook mushrooms, 
tossing to keep from burning, until browned, about 5 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 When chicken is cooked, remove breast meat and leg quarters to warmed platter, 
cover with foil and keep in warm oven. Ladle chicken cooking liquid through 
cheesecloth-lined strainer into saucepan. Bring liquid to boil. Adjust 
seasonings to taste. Liquid should be somewhat under-salted as sea salt will be 
added later. 
</P>
<P>
 Place 1 piece of chicken in middle of shallow soup or pasta bowl and arrange 
vegetables around it. Spoon over stock, being careful not to stir vegetables. 
Sprinkle lightly with parsley and then sprinkle some coarse-grain sea salt over 
chicken meat. Makes 4 servings, with 1 chicken left over.

HOME COOK: DIPS AND DUNKS, DITS AND DOOTS

 As much as I enjoy cooking, I find myself uninspired when it comes to making 
appetizers or hors d'oeuvres. In fact, I'm slightly impatient with the whole 
custom of eating just before sitting down at the table (though I always eat 
whatever is passed around). Perhaps the '40s-era custom of accompanying the 
pre-meal drinks with a swath of cream cheese in the form of dips and dunks 
(James Beard use to call these dits and doots) just became too much. 
</P>
<P>
 But if you're going to serve appetizers, at least skip those that are more 
trouble to make than they are worth. And don't serve dinner so late that 
everyone is sated before being seated at the table. Appetizers are only 
intended to stave off acute hunger pangs and temper drinking on an empty 
stomach.

 Most people seem to like deviled eggs. They are best when you don't get too 
creative with them, such as adding tarragon and other alien flavors. Make sure 
the yolk filling is blended smoothly.  
</P>
<P>
 DEVILED EGGS 
</P>
<P>
 4 hard-cooked eggs 
</P>
<P>
 3 tablespoons mayonnaise 
</P>
<P>
 1 teaspoon Dijon mustard 
</P>
<P>
 Salt 
</P>
<P>
 Freshly ground pepper 
</P>
<P>
 Parsley 
</P>
<P>
 Shell eggs and slice in half lengthwise. Remove yolks. In bowl mash yolks with 
mayonnaise, mustard, salt and pepper to taste until smoothly blended and 
creamy. 
</P>
<P>
 Divide into 8 equal portions and stuff into hollow of each egg white. Sprinkle 
tops with parsley to taste. Makes 4 servings.

 At the moment, this is my favorite appetizer. It's a "two for the price of 
one" recipe. After you serve the zucchini you will have enough garlic olive oil 
to dress several salads or spike up some sauces. You can substitute broccoli or 
tiny artichokes for zucchini.  
</P>
<P>
 ZUCCHINI, OLIVE OIL AND GARLIC APPETIZER 
</P>
<P>
 1 1/2 pounds shiny, firm zucchini 
</P>
<P>
 Kosher salt 
</P>
<P>
 1 cup olive oil 
</P>
<P>
 4 large cloves garlic, each chopped into 4 or 5 pieces 
</P>
<P>
 1/4 teaspoon hot pepper sauce  
</P>
<P>
 Trim stem and root end of zucchini and cut into pieces about 3/4 inch long. In 
pot cook zucchini in boiling salted water until firm but slightly tender, about 
1 1/2 minutes. Drain and set aside. 
</P>
<P>
 Pour olive oil into bowl large enough to hold zucchini. Add garlic and hot 
pepper sauce. Stir to mix. Season hot zucchini generously with salt to taste. 
Add to olive oil marinade and toss to coat. Cover and set aside at room 
temperature (in refrigerator if making day ahead). Stir every few hours until 
serving time. 
</P>
<P>
 Remove zucchini from marinade. Adjust seasonings to taste. Serve at room 
temperature with napkins. Makes 5 servings.

 This tastes far better than it reads. GARLIC SWISS CHEESE SPREAD 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 cup mayonnaise 
</P>
<P>
 2 cloves garlic, peeled and finely chopped or put through garlic press  
</P>
<P>
 2 cups grated Swiss cheese  
</P>
<P>
 2 tablespoons finely chopped parsley  
</P>
<P>
 Crackers 
</P>
<P>
 In bowl mix mayonnaise and garlic thoroughly with Swiss cheese, using enough 
mayonnaise to make spreadable. Put mixture into bowl just large enough to 
contain ingredients, cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate. 
</P>
<P>
 When ready to serve, turn out onto platter and form into mound using hands. 
Sprinkle with parsley and surround with crackers. Makes 2 1/2 cups.

 Each tablespoon contains about:

 Welcome to Los Diablos: As if nerves weren't already on edge, the Weekly World 
News tabloid asserts that the Northridge quake "opened the gates of hell, 
enabling at least 17 demons to escape from a gaping crack in the Golden State 
Freeway." 
</P>
<P>
 The newspaper said "the fanged, foul-smelling creatures . . . fanned out and 
have been sighted simultaneously in different sections" of the city. The News 
pointed out ominously that "when taken to the nearest 1/100, the earthquake 
measured 6.66 on the Richter scale," referring to the number that represents 
the devil in the Book of Revelation. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking of revelations, we have a couple of our own for the News: The quake's 
magnitude has been upgraded to 6.7 by Caltech and is expected to be raised to 
6.8 by experts in Golden, Colo., today. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, we did spot a trio of foul-smelling, quite possibly fanged 
creatures the other night. They were fanning out along Hollywood Boulevard. 
</P>

 Havana a bit of fun with us?A previous disaster in Los Diablos -- excuse us, 
Los Angeles -- prompted an exclusive by a different supermarket tabloid in 
1992. The Sun's headline screamed: "Castro Led Riots in L.A. . . . Eyewitnesses 
claim the crazed Cuban dictator led the looters." 
</P>
<P>
 We sort of doubted that one, too. But, a few weeks later, we noticed a photo 
of Fidel attending the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro. Darned if he didn't 
appear to be wearing a new pair of sneakers. 
</P>

 List of the day: Billboard messages with a distinctly L.A. point of view:

Convention Center)

<P>
 * "It's hard to spot the fakes in this town" (gas logs).

 * "Traffic Jam on PCH" (vacation resort, with a row of sailboats as an 
illustration). 
</P>
<P>
 * "The 405 Should Be This Smooth" (whiskey).

 * "Just What L.A. Needs. More Heels" (shoe company). 
</P>

 Who says Southern California has no seasons?The Ventura Star Free Press had

 On the cutting edge: Bill Givens says, "It didn't take long -- the John 
Bobbitt movie must be out already. While riding down Montana Avenue in Santa 
Monica, I noticed that the marquee of the Aero Theater read 'My Life' with 'A 
Dangerous Woman.' " miscelLAny: 
</P>
<P>
 In its Feb. 7 issue, People magazine proudly reports that it "reached out to 
disaster victims by arranging for the Red Cross to distribute 3,300 copies of 
the magazine to five shelters in Northridge and Van Nuys."

SCOTT HARRIS: VALLEY BUSINESSES LANGUISH IN STATE OF AFTERSHOCK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In Sherman Oaks, the dreaded red tag has closed 3,000 apartments and condos. A 
13-story office tower on Ventura Boulevard has been shut down. The roof 
collapsed at Sav-On. The Gap and Banana Republic have removed their stock from 
La Reina Fashion Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Ourieff assumes everything and everyone will be back in time. But will 
that time come soon enough? 
</P>
<P>
 Ourieff is the proprietor of Michael J's Italian Kitchen in Sherman Oaks, 
which enables him to see the less obvious effects of the Jan. 17 earthquake -- 
the way this temblor has put cracks in daily commerce. Before the ground shook, 
Ventura Boulevard was probably the most vibrant street in all of Los Angeles. 
Now terms like "ghost town" crop up. 
</P>
<P>
 That is overstating it, but Ourieff estimates that local business is down 30% 
in his eatery. He wonders whether his family restaurant, now in its 11th year, 
can survive. 
</P>
<P>
 So one day last week, the restaurateur shared his problems with somebody who 
might be able to make a difference. And U.S. Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown 
promised that he'd try to help. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Don't be surprised if you hadn't heard about Brown's visit. Ron Brown didn't 
want the media tagging along Feb. 2 when he helicoptered onto the roof of 
Sherman Oaks Hospital and Health Center. His visit to the Ventura County town 
of Fillmore earlier the same day was a public show. There, Brown was able to 
personally deliver four checks to homeowners and business people who need 
emergency aid. 
</P>
<P>
 At Sherman Oaks, there was no press conference, no photo op. This was Brown's 
decision, according to Jeff Brain, an immediate past president of the Sherman 
Oaks Chamber of Commerce who helped arrange the visit. Perhaps Brown just 
didn't want to deal with pesky questions. Brain prefers to think that Brown 
simply wanted to concentrate on business. 
</P>
<P>
 Sherman Oaks is an excellent place to get a feel for the far-flung impact. 
Media images of the quake have been dominated by broken freeways and the 
destruction within Northridge. But Sherman Oaks, built on land that was 
sometimes under water when the Los Angeles River ran wild, incurred inordinate 
damage as the ground shook like Jell-O. 
</P>
<P>
 A survey by a city panel that oversees planning for the 17 miles of Ventura 
Boulevard suggests that businesses in Sherman Oaks suffered more damage than 
Woodland Hills, Tarzana, Encino and Studio City combined. In Woodland Hills, 
destruction along the boulevard was estimated at $1.9 million -- mostly damaged 
inventory and broken windows. It was $2.1 million in Tarzana, $2 million in 
Encino, and $7.1 million in Studio City. The Sherman Oaks stretch of the 
boulevard, meanwhile, incurred $27 million in damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Not long after the quake hit, Brain gave Rep. Anthony Beilenson (D-Woodland 
Hills) a tour of the damage in the east end of his congressional district. 
Later, Brain did the same for James Lee Witt, director of the Federal Emergency 
Management Agency. When Brain discussed the business troubles along the 
boulevard, Witt said there was little FEMA could do and suggested that Brown 
was the man to see. 
</P>
<P>
 So the visit was arranged. A group of about 35 business and political leaders 
met with Brown. City Council members Laura Chick and Zev Yaroslavsky attended 
along with representatives of Valley business organizations. A vice president 
of Bullocks Macy flew in for the meeting. And Ourieff came over from his 
restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 The Valley was already hurting due to the cutbacks in the aerospace industry. 
Now, according to one estimate, the quake put 20,000 more people out of work. 
Questions loom about whether landlords will rebuild or walk away from damaged 
buildings. There is worry that the economic ripple could become a tsunami, 
washing away many more jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told Ron Brown, if we don't do something, this is going to have a trickle 
down effect," Ourieff said. "If I don't survive, I'm going to lay off my 25 
people. . . . And there's a lot of businesses in a similar situation." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For all the gloomy scenarios, Ourieff and Brain came out of the meeting 
hopeful. Brain says the Commerce Department is trying to set up three new loan 
programs to help businesses that may not qualify for assistance from the Small 
Business Administration or the Federal Emergency Management Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Ourieff, a Van Nuys native, says he'll put everything into saving his 
restaurant. He's already filled out his SBA application. Now he waits and hopes 
and remembers what President Clinton's Commerce secretary had to say. 
</P>
<P>
 "WHat he said was at this point we don't have a vehicle to help you with this 
type of situation -- and what we're here to do is create that vehicle," Ourieff 
recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whether that's rhetoric, I don't know," he added. "But I liked what he had to 
say."

DON'T LET HEALTH REFORM DIE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Some detractors are crowing that President Clinton's health care plan has in 
effect been killed by an adverse assessment by the Congressional Budget Office. 
No doubt the proposal requires overhaul; the President himself knows this. But 
even with all the rethinking and horse-trading to come, it would be an error 
for foes of reform to assume that trouble for the Clinton plan means the end of 
reform. 
</P>
<P>
 The momentum for restructuring the way health care is delivered and paid for 
in the United States is stronger than ever. This is true despite the 
troublesome verdict delivered Tuesday by the Congressional Budget Office. The 
CBO, whose imprimatur typically is sought by lawmakers wanting objective 
verification of how much a program would cost, said that the Clinton plan would 
increase the federal deficit by $74 billion in its first six years. The 
Administration had lobbied furiously to persuade the nonpartisan CBO that the 
reform package actually would reduce the deficit by $58 billion between 1995 
and 2000. The CBO also determined that the plan's requirement that employers 
pay at least 80% of the insurance costs for workers, with employees paying the 
rest, would be a government "receipt." That's a polite way of saying the plan 
is a big new entitlement program, one that eventually could cost more than 
Social Security. 
</P>
<P>
 But even with all that, the outlook now is good for real health care reform 
this year. In dramatic contrast to just one year ago, it's hard to find many 
Democrats or Republicans who do not acknowledge the necessity of fixing a 
health care system so expensive that millions of Americans cannot afford to get 
themselves well, or keep themselves healthy. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill and Hillary Rodham Clinton have pushed Congress into the first stage of 
consensus on what health care reform should entail: some configuration of 
purchasing pools to give clout to individuals and small businesses seeking 
better bargains from insurers; prohibitions against denying insurance to those 
with pre-existing conditions; streamlining administrative rules to cut back on 
paperwork; placing greater emphasis on preventive care; maintaining a measure 
of consumer choice in selecting doctors and hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
 Serious health care reform, including the difficult problem of cost 
containment, is still a way down the road. But now at least there is a road.

GUN WATCH; DUCKY IDEA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Professional hockey, the sport that gave us goon squads, thundering body 
checks and wayward sticks, appears to be taking a turn on the ice in Anaheim as 
a responsible community citizen. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mighty Ducks expansion franchise of the National Hockey League has 
scrapped its way to a respectable start this season as the new kid on the 
block.It has had to establish territory, as any neighborhood upstart would. But 
whatever aggressive posturing there may be in a mere game, the owner, the Walt 
Disney Co., would do a service by going ahead with a proposal to alleviate a 
real menace to the fans' world outside the arena -- namely the terrible 
proliferation of firearms. 
</P>
<P>
 Joining the national tide of businesses and governments looking to entice gun 
owners to turn in weapons, the company is working with Anaheim police to 
establish an exchange of hockey tickets for guns.  
</P>
<P>
 This would be no self-serving gesture from a new team merely trying to boost 
its box office. The Mighty Ducks already have had 14 sellouts and have averaged 
16,829 fans in the new 17,174-seat Anaheim Arena. A Mighty Ducks ticket is a 
desirable possession among sports fans. 
</P>
<P>
 Disney also plans to build a team practice rink that would double as a 
community youth center, perhaps creating a hockey program aimed at troubled 
youths. 
</P>
<P>
 By buttoning up these proposals, the entertainment giant can signal its 
intention to be an innovative and positive community force as it contemplates 
an ambitious expansion of Disneyland in an increasingly urban area.

TONYA HARDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * If we really want the whole of America represented at the Olympics, I would 
suggest we send both Tonya Harding and Nancy Kerrigan. Harding can represent a 
lack of integrity, dishonesty, greed and ruthlessness.Kerrigan conveys all the 
ideals that we like to think of as the real America -- grace, innocence, 
professionalism and dignity. 
</P>
<P>
 LENA RIVKIN 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 * There is no credible evidence, at this time, that Tonya Harding had any 
prior knowledge of Jeff Gillooly's admitted attempt to harm Nancy Kerrigan. Of 
course Gillooly says she had such prior knowledge. But Gillooly is an admitted 
perjurer, who implicated Harding to reduce a probable 20-year sentence to two 
years. His tale is in the realm of possibility but, coming from him or his 
pals, hardly credible. 
</P>
<P>
 If Harding had prior knowledge of the attack she should not be permitted to 
compete in the Olympic Games and benefit from her wrongdoing. However, in 
America a person is innocent until proven guilty.  
</P>
<P>
 It is possible, and even credible, considering Gillooly's actions that Harding 
may only be guilty of loving a jerk who was so intent on living off her fame, 
and fortune, if she won the Olympic Games, that he decided on his own to ensure 
he received that fortune. If poor judgment in relationships is made a crime we 
could never build enough prisons. 
</P>
<P>
 Until it is proven that Harding had prior knowledge of the attack on Kerrigan 
she should be permitted to compete. 
</P>

Harding's behavior reeks. She should be ejected from the Olympic team -- 
without further debate.

 * I proffer my most heartfelt thanks for Al Martinez's column (Jan. 25) about 
the residence for victims of Alzheimer's disease.It was sincere and accurate. 
Having recently helped move my beloved father to such a facility, it touched me 
deeply to realize that others understand the relentless pain this nightmare 
illness visits upon its victims and their families. 
</P>
<P>
 My family and I would welcome more information about Alzheimer's and must also 
express our gratitude and admiration to those who care for its sufferers.

PERSPECTIVE ON MIDEAST PEACE; SECURING ISRAEL'S JEWISH IDENTITY; THE 
IMPLEMENTATION OF PALESTINIAN SELF-RULE WILL RESTORE THE ZIONIST IDEAL AS WELL 
AS ENHANCE THE PROSPECTS FOR PEACE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MENACHEM Z. ROSENSAFT, Menachem Z. Rosensaft, a lawyer in New York, was 
national president of the Labor Zionist Alliance in December, 1988, when he was 
one of five American Jews who met with Yasser Arafat in Stockholm, leading to 
the PLO's recognition of the state of Israel. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With Wednesday's initialing of the agreement between Israel and the PLO, the 
Israeli and Palestinian peoples embark on a historic but uncharted journey. The 
risks are real. But the present Israeli government has wisely recognized that 
an agreement based on territorial compromise -- that is, trading land for peace 
with security -- is Israel's only viable option if it wants to remain a Jewish 
state. 
</P>
<P>
 It is symbolic that President Clinton announced the initialing Wednesday at a 
meeting of the World Jewish Congress board of governors in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 The premise on which the state of Israel was established in 1948, the Zionist 
ideal, was that, while all citizens -- Jews, Muslims and Christians alike -- 
would have full equality, Israel would have a permanent Jewish majority, thus 
ensuring its Jewish character. Until the Six-Day War of 1967, the Jewish 
majority status was not in any jeopardy. With the occupation of the West Bank 
and Gaza Strip, however, Israel found itself in control of the lives of a large 
Palestinian population, which has since grown to almost 2 million. 
</P>
<P>
 As a practical matter, there were four options for the future, two of which 
were utterly unfeasible. The dream of Arab nationalists to drive Israel into 
the sea is no more viable than the desire of some reactionary Israeli 
politicians to transfer all Arabs out of the occupied territories. That left 
either territorial compromise or Israel's permanent retention of the 
territories. 
</P>
<P>
 The essence of the politically fundamentalist vision of right-wing leaders, 
such as former Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir and former Defense Minister Ariel 
Sharon, was that Israel would never relinquish a single inch of the West Bank 
or Gaza. That path, however, would have led in relatively short order to the 
creation of a binational state, for it is inconceivable that 2 million 
Palestinians would have been allowed to remain in a state of perpetual 
disfranchisement. If Israel had insisted on retaining political control over 
the occupied territories no matter what, it would sooner or later have had to 
integrate the population of the West Bank and Gaza Strip into the Israeli body 
politic.  
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, it was for many years the goal of the PLO to have such a 
binational state -- a secular Palestinian state in which Arabs and Jews could 
live together. What the PLO wanted to achieve, of course, was the extinction of 
the Zionist state of Israel, replacing it with a new political entity along the 
lines of Lebanon or Belgium, in which no one religion or nationality was 
dominant. 
</P>
<P>
 In December, 1988, the PLO changed its position and recognized the state of 
Israel, agreeing to have a Palestinian homeland that would exist alongside the 
Jewish state. This shift provided the basis for the Israeli-Palestinian 
Declaration of Principles, which was signed on Sept. 13, 1993, and for 
Wednesday's agreement implementing that declaration. 
</P>
<P>
 Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and Foreign Minister Shimon Peres understood that 
the only alternative to integrating the Palestinians of the West Bank and Gaza 
into the Israeli body politic was to give them the opportunity of having their 
civil and political rights, including the right to national self-determination, 
within their own, separate body politic. 
</P>
<P>
 Several days ago, I received a letter from PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat, in 
which he reflected on the importance of the Declaration of Principles and the 
peace process: 
</P>
<P>
 "Definitely (the declaration) is an important historic event in the history of 
the Palestinian and Israeli peoples. It is, as well, an important historic 
event in the history and development of the region. It paves the way for 
opening wide horizons for establishing just peace in the region after decades 
of war and enmity, oppression and injustice. Now we have to be able to open a 
new chapter in our relations on the basis of our mutual respect, fruitful 
cooperation and resolution of conflict by dialogue and arbitration. . . . We 
believe that the commitment to implement (the declaration), in letter and in 
spirit, is the only guarantee to achieve just peace for both the Israeli and 
Palestinian peoples, which would make it possible to end the bloody conflict. . 
. . "  
</P>
<P>
 The Israeli-Palestinian peace process has far to go, and there are sure to be 
many hurdles along the way. It is clear, however, that by enabling the 
Palestinians to develop separately into a viable national political unit, the 
leaders of Israel have also ensured the Jewish future of the state of Israel.

MAKING SENSE OF THE HEALTH-CARE DEBATE; REFORM: THE PROMISED LAND MAY BE OUT 
THERE, BUT THE VISION IS DISTORTED BY INTERESTS WHO DO NOT WANT TO MAKE THE 
JOURNEY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TED MARMOR and JERRY MASHAW, Ted Marmor teaches public policy and Jerry 
Mashaw teaches law at Yale University. They are co-authors of America's 
Misunderstood Welfare State (Basic Books, 1992). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the second year of the debate on health-care reform initiated by President 
Clinton, are we any closer to resolving the dispute? Or is the possibility of 
resolution ebbing away as the interest groups, pundits and politicians find 
fault with every plan but their own? 
</P>
<P>
 The past week has not been kind to Clinton's reform effort. His State of the 
Union address was meant to reinvigorate the campaign but had precisely the 
opposite fate. The President and his wife wooed the Business Roundtable but the 
captains of commerce backed the rival bill of Rep. Jim Cooper (D-Tenn.). News 
stories then noted a pattern: the rejection of the Clinton bill by the Chamber 
of Commerce even as a starting point of debate, and further opposition by the 
National Assn. of Manufacturers and, predictably, Ross Perot. (And on Tuesday, 
the Congressional Budget Office's deficit analysis of the President's plan 
further amplified criticism.) 
</P>
<P>
 What does all this mean? Have we had a year of reflection by all these 
business figures? Does their rejection of the President's laboriously produced 
plan tell us something significant about where the President went wrong and 
where the nation should go instead? We think not. 
</P>
<P>
 The debate has degenerated into a mix of ideological name-calling and numbing 
techno-babble. According to the newest critics, the problems with the 
President's plan are familiar -- excessive, intrusive bureaucracy and 
unaffordable, unworkable demands on American business. This is what most 
business leaders would have claimed had the President called for universalizing 
Medicare or borrowing the Canadian model of national health insurance, so 
obviously the President got little benefit from trying to anticipate business' 
ideological objections in his initial proposal or from courting their approval 
after the fact. Indeed, why should anyone familiar with 20th-Century U.S. 
history expect organized business to lay aside its anti-government rhetoric and 
embrace compulsory health insurance?  
</P>
<P>
 The Administration now finds itself on the defensive. Critics on every side 
have questioned the complexity of the President's reform scheme. Sen. Daniel 
Patrick Moynihan (D.-N.Y.) appeared to doubt whether the nation really faces a 
medical-care crisis; Sen. Bob Dole (R-Kan.) caricatured the Clinton bill with 
his now-infamous chart of complexity. Business groups complain about new 
bureaucracies, with no mention of the crazy quilt of private health-insurance 
bureaucracy we now face. 
</P>
<P>
 What we are experiencing is mostly political theater, not policy analysis. The 
scene has shifted from technocratic seminars to commentators and political 
junkies. For example, an inexperienced writer on health care peddles 5,000 
words of abuse on the Clinton plan to the New Republic; before a rebuttal can 
be printed, George Will, Dole and others have repeated the story's misleading 
claims. We are surely at a new stage, but it has little to do with the vital 
question of how health-care reform would work in practice. 
</P>
<P>
 What this does resemble is the worst of American political campaigns, full of 
she said / he said charge and countercharge. We have a crisis that threatens 
our whole society; there is no crisis. The public wants medical care reform; 
the public insists on the status quo. For every reform effort, there is a 
reaction -- discredit and derail. The media do not cheer this confusing 
process, but those who thrive on conflict certainly nurture it. 
</P>
<P>
 Real events like the endorsement of the Cooper bill by the Business Roundtable 
are immediately transmogrified by spin doctors. As the New Democrat from 
Tennessee basked in media exposure, Citizen Action, a public-interest group, 
hit Cooper with a release charging that he accepted $200,000 last year in 
campaign contributions from the health industry. 
</P>
<P>
 While it is not surprising that corporate chief executives would support a 
bill that preserves much of the status quo over more sweeping change, it is 
also no surprise that there were groups waiting to take a shot at Cooper. And 
it is least surprising that the media would want to make a big deal of all of 
this. 
</P>
<P>
 The tools of obfuscation and manipulation are now insidiously effective. With 
so much at stake, every interest hyperventilates. The very survival of the 
Health Insurance Assn. of America hinges on the outcome. As such, the trade 
group feels more than justified claiming in its "Harry and Louise" commercials 
that choice and quality in American medicine would be destroyed by new 
bureaucracies dressed up as "alliances." 
</P>
<P>
 Not all is darkness, however. The Kaiser Family Foundation and the League of 
Women Voters are devoting millions of dollars to distributing what they 
seriously regard as the truth about U.S. medical problems and options. Their 
plain-spoken ads simply outline how many Americans lack health insurance and 
who they are.  
</P>
<P>
 But the most disturbing truth is that two years into one of the most important 
political debates in a generation, the most basic problems have not been 
sufficiently clarified for Americans to agree conclusively that our situation 
is critical and warrants substantial reform. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration has brought us only so far. The promised land may be out 
there, but the reform vision is now clouded and distorted by interests that do 
not want to get there at all, or are hoping for a modest resettlement, not a 
wholesale exodus. Within Washington, the task may be deal-making. Outside 
Washington, the task is moral mobilization and clearer argument.

COLUMN RIGHT/ JAMES P. PINKERTON: BUDGET SPIN WON'T MAKE IT TO PARKING LOT; 
CLINTON'S CUTS ARE ILLUSORY. WILL NEW TAXES AND SPENDING HALT THE COUNTRY'S 
ECONOMIC UPSWING? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES P. PINKERTON, James P. Pinkerton, based in Washington, is a senior 
fellow at the Manhattan Institute.

<P>
 Government predictions are like the double dip on a soft ice-cream cone. The 
butterscotch glaze looks solid enough when you buy it, but it comes apart when 
you bite it. By the time you leave the Dairy Queen parking lot, the thin crust 
is only a memory, the ice cream underneath is melting and soon you have a mess. 
President Clinton's fiscal 1995 budget numbers are similar: a candy coating on 
$1.5 trillion of stickiness. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton served up a deluxe scoop of spin. He let it leak that this was a 
"bare-bones" budget, axing 115 programs and reducing 300 more. Cuts in 
subsidies to diverse constituencies -- mass transit, agribusiness, defense 
contractors -- made it look as if everyone was feeling pain. The Pavlovian 
yelps of the special interests helped Clinton look tough, enabling him to get 
maximum credit for a minimum amount of actual chopping. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, programs with truly powerful patrons got second helpings of federal 
money. Some budget winners were predictable: Clinton's friends at the National 
Education Assn. will help Uncle Sam spend another $3 billion for schools next 
year. Other increases were tributes to business-as-usual in Washington. Clinton 
proposed increased spending for the National Board for the Promotion of Rifle 
Practice, the NRA's pet federal program. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton arrived at his impressive-sounding total of 115 program eliminations 
by itemizing even the dinkiest deletions. Thus he got a mention in news 
accounts for killing $140,000 for shark research, which is the amount that the 
federal government spends every three seconds. Overall, the $3 billion in cuts 
that Clinton trumpeted come to just 0.2% of the budget. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, all of Clinton's austerity occurs within the one-third of 
"discretionary" spending. Automatic entitlements account for half of the 
budget, and here Clinton proposed no reductions at all, letting them continue 
to rise. While Clinton takes credit for fiddling with funding for oilseed and 
job training, the bulk of the budget was left untended. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's numbers only seemed solid when they were released on Monday, but by 
Tuesday they were already bleeding. Congressional Budget Office Director Robert 
Reischauer declared that the cost of the President's health plan should count 
"on budget," and that it would amount to $132 billion more than the 
Administration esti mated. Stumping in Louisiana, Clinton dismissed these 
unhelpful CBO findings as "a Washington policy-wonk deal," adding that "no 
serious person out here in the real world" will worry about the CBO's findings. 
Yet any President's budget is a dependent variable, hanging on the reality of 
the macroeconomy.  
</P>
<P>
 Five years ago, President Bush said that thanks to his "realistic plan," the 
deficit would shrink to $98 billion. He was off by 124%. In "the real world," 
inflation, unemployment and 96-point drops in the stock market mean far more to 
the deficit than presidential assurances. The Cato Institute found that the 
deficit projections of the last four Presidents have been off by an average of 
1% of gross domestic product. If 1994 holds to the pattern, then Clinton's 
deficit will be some $60 billion higher than the $176 billion he's aiming for. 
</P>
<P>
 Leon Panetta, director of the Office of Management and Budget, conceded this 
week that no forecast could be precise in this swirling world: "The fundamental 
test of a budget is whether or not it is working in the economy." If our 
crystal ball is perpetually cloudy, then what do we do? We should pay less 
attention to charts and graphs and more attention to the fundamentals of 
economic growth. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, at least, Clinton policy has not made a dent in the upward trend of 
the U.S. economy. By leaving well enough alone, Clinton will rightfully benefit 
from relative peace and prosperity around the planet. The great engine of that 
prosperity is world trade. Since World War II, presidents of both parties have 
expanded commerce through the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. This 80% 
reduction in the tax on trade has made us all better off. U.S. exports, for 
example, have more than doubled in the past decade. Clinton has helped by 
pushing the North American Free Trade Agreement and the latest round of GATT. 
</P>
<P>
 But what will be the impact of more taxes, regulation and unchecked 
entitlement spending here at home? The strong performance of the economy in 
recent months offers hope that we can weather another squall of domestic 
government activism. But the fate of Clintonomics -- including the deficit -- 
will be determined by what happens in "the real world," for the rest of this 
year and the rest of this decade.

 If it's February, this must be Redlands. Home of the only Lincoln memorial 
west of the Mississippi. 
</P>
<P>
 We are met at the Lincoln Memorial Shrine by a man in a gray flannel suit 
wielding a Civil War sword. He is surrounded by a group of grade-schoolers for 
whom that long-ago war is only as real as a rented video. 
</P>
<P>
 Meet Don McCue. Seven years ago, he answered a help-wanted ad in a newspaper 
and wound up here as curator. Quite honestly, he says, he was no Lincoln 
scholar, having trained for a career in the foreign service. 
</P>
<P>
 But, having now read dozens of books in the shrine's 3,000-volume collection 
and having fielded questions on everything from Mrs. Lincoln's sanity to Abe 
Lincoln's love life, McCue has more than a passing acquaintance with our 16th 
President. 
</P>
<P>
 A few of his observations: 
</P>
<P>
 * On Mary Todd Lincoln: "She faced a lot of what Hillary Clinton is facing. 
Women weren't supposed to be involved in politics in those days. There was a 
backlash: Here was this uppity woman poking her nose in places she didn't 
belong." 
</P>
<P>
 * On Lincoln as pragmatist: "We have this image of Honest Abe, but he knew how 
to roll logs and scratch backs. He was the consummate politician." 
</P>
<P>
 McCue points to one of 15 signed Lincoln letters at the shrine. Lincoln is 
granting a discharge to a soldier facing court martial for deserting after the 
battle of Antietam. Lincoln was facing reelection -- and the soldier's father 
happened to be an influential judge in a vote-rich state. 
</P>
<P>
 * On Lincoln-bashing by those who point out that his overriding goal was to 
save the Union, not to emancipate the slaves, nor to gain equality for them: 
"Some of that is justified . . . but there is a temptation to impose 1990s 
standards on the 1860s." 
</P>
<P>
 As curator and sometime tour guide of this jewel box museum/library/research 
facility, McCue, 36, winces when confronted by schoolchildren who don't know 
what slavery was and recognize Lincoln only as the face on a $5 bill. 
</P>
<P>
 But he's prepared for the callers who ask: 
</P>
<P>
 "Is it true that Lincoln was killed by the Jesuits?" (A theory advanced in the 
1880s by an ex-priest who saw a conspiracy with the Pope to eliminate Lincoln 
and make America a Catholic country.) 
</P>
<P>
 "Is it true that my great-great-great grandfather was a drinking buddy of 
Lincoln after he was jilted by Ann Rutledge?" (Probably not. Since the PBS 
series, "The Civil War," in 1990, family tree queries have abounded.) 
</P>
<P>
 One person was convinced that Lincoln is buried in the handsome octagonal 
shrine and had to be persuaded that the leader never even visited California. 
</P>
<P>
 So what is a Lincoln memorial doing in Redlands, population 64,000? Thank 
Robert Watchorn, a rags-to-riches immigrant who started as a 27-cents-a-day 
child laborer in the English coal mines and became president of his own oil and 
gas company. 
</P>
<P>
 Watchorn, fascinated with Lincoln, put up $60,000 to build this shrine, which 
honors both Lincoln and the memory of Watchorn's son, who died of World War I 
injuries. Completed in 1932, it was given to the city of Redlands, where the 
Watchorn family wintered. 
</P>
<P>
 The collection it houses is, at the very least, eclectic. There is a pair of 
ladies' high-button dancing shoes worn to Lincoln's second inaugural ball, a 
crepe mourner's armband from Lincoln's funeral and bullets from Gettysburg. 
</P>
<P>
 Watchorn did not wish to perpetuate war between North and South. That's why 
busts of the Union's Ulysses S. Grant and the Confederacy's Robert E. Lee flank 
the entrance. An expansion, planned for 1995, will add a gray wing and a blue 
wing. (The shrine's unlikely angels include a group of Sons of Confederate 
Veterans.) 
</P>
<P>
 The most valuable acquisition, appraised at $200,000, is a Norman Rockwell 
oil, painted in the mid-'40s for the Saturday Evening Post. It is titled 
"Thoughts on Peace on Lincoln's Birthday." 
</P>
<P>
 With an acquisition budget of only $12,000 a year, McCue is resigned to having 
been "priced out of the market" by private Lincoln collectors. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, even a note from Lincoln to his secretary regarding an appointment with 
an unidentified someone may fetch $6,000. Lincoln signatures clipped from 
discarded documents bring $2,000 to $3,000. Those wouldn't particularly 
interest McCue, who seeks that which "sheds light on Lincoln's life, his 
stewardship." 
</P>
<P>
 At least once a week, McCue says, an excited citizen brings in an aged-looking 
parchment copy of the Gettysburg Address. Alas, these are merely old souvenirs 
from the "Great Moments with Mr. Lincoln" attraction at Disneyland. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday -- Lincoln's Birthday -- the Lincoln Memorial Assn. will gather at 
the University of Redlands for a dinner talk by Charles B. Strozier of John Jay 
College, City University of New York. 
</P>
<P>
 He is a psychohistorian, one who delves into the psychological motivations of 
great figures in history. And he has a theory that Lincoln's determination to 
preserve the Union resulted from his fractured family life as a child. (Abe's 
father was a "squatter," an itinerant farmer; his mother died when he was only 
9, his only sibling, Sarah, when he was 19.) 
</P>
<P>
 Strozier advanced his theory in his book, "Lincoln's Quest for Union." You can 
find it among the 3,000 volumes at the Lincoln Memorial Shrine. Remnants of the 
Past 
</P>
<P>
 When first encountered, Leonard Galati, 72, was down on all fours, his head 
under a table, on top of which was arranged his collection of antique 
mechanical banks. 
</P>
<P>
 Resurfacing at the All-American Collectors' Show in Glendale, he explained 
that he'd dropped a couple of nickels, which didn't seem worth searching for, 
"so I threw two quarters down to make it 60 cents." 
</P>
<P>
 Galati had come from Carson with his banks -- among them a 125-year-old "Boss 
Tweed" model. Watch, he said, placing a coin in the Boss's cast-iron hand. "He 
fills his greedy little pockets and bobs his head, 'thank you.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Nearby, Dennis Clark, who has a shop on Melrose Avenue, was getting plenty of 
attention -- if no takers -- with a pair of 7-foot fiberglass "Ultraman" 
figures with winged helmets from the '50s. (Asking price: $7,500 each.) 
</P>
<P>
 The robots, which are giant gum ball machines, come from Tokyo, where 
"Ultraman" is a sort of Superman. Hidden inside each is a tape player. Clark 
explained: "When you put a coin in, they talk to you" -- in Japanese. 
</P>
<P>
 Vintage Hot Wheels and Shogun Warriors were among the antique toys offered by 
Long Beach dealer Nathan Forman. "People are buying their memories," he said. 
"They plug into their childhood." (And, yes, G.I. Joe just turned 30.) 
</P>
<P>
 All in all, trade was not brisk, post-earthquake. George Zaninovich, a San 
Pedro dealer, wasn't surprised: "People aren't eager to buy when they have like 
two feet of collectibles on the floor of their hobby room."

 The Scene: The 10th annual American Cinema Awards, which doesn't really give 
awards for artistic achievements but salutes to some of the entertainment 
industry's biggest names. An array of about 300 of Hollywood's vintage and 
current stars gathered at the Beverly Hilton Hotel on Sunday. Whitney Houston 
presented the evening's top honor, the Gloria Swanson Humanitarian Award, to 
her mentor, Arista Records Chief Executive Officer Clive Davis. 
</P>
<P>
 Who Was There: Who wasn't there would be easier. Host Robert Wagner spent 
nearly an hour introducing the guests. The short list: Oscar winners Luise

 The Charity: Wagner and event chairman Leo Jaffe, the former chief of Columbia 
Pictures, reported that between $500,000 and $600,000 was raised for the Motion 
Picture and Television Country Home and Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sentiment: Shirley Bassey's choice of the song "As If We Never Said 
Goodbye," from the musical "Sunset Boulevard," was more fitting than she 
probably realized. All around the room, the feeling was that of a reunion of 
old friends. 
</P>
<P>
 Noted: Movie historian and professor Richard Brown observed: "This event 
dramatically rebuts the notion that the Hollywood community forgets its talent 
once they are no longer the flavor of the month. There are performers here 
tonight who have not been that flavor for four or five decades. But they are 
being treated here tonight as if they were just as delicious as ever." 
</P>
<P>
 Other Honors: Hospital suites will be built in the names of Leslie Caron, 
Maureen O'Hara, Poitier, Quinn and Rogers. Also Victor Mature, who was not 
present, and the late Anthony Perkins. Caron, who flew in from Paris, said she 
was "very touched": "It's better even than having your hands and footprints in 
cement at the Chinese Theatre."

BOOK REVIEW / MEMOIR; AUTOBIOGRAPHY THAT GOES BEYOND REALITY; EXCURSIONS IN THE 
REAL WORLD: MEMOIRS, BY WILLIAM TREVOR , ALFRED A. KNOPF; $23, 201 PAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD EDER, TIMES BOOK CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The short stories for which William Trevor is best known, and his novels and 
novellas, which I find even more remarkable, possess a reality as jolting as a 
burst tire. 
</P>
<P>
 Reality is not the things Trevor sees but what he sees through them. When he 
invents his characters, the point is not their features and actions, or even 
their thoughts and emotions -- accomplished as they are -- but what lies 
beyond. 
</P>
<P>
 The same is true of his landscapes, whose grasses or bare hills seem to stand 
for something else. Call it soul, as in Chekhov, to whom a few other writers 
are tediously -- and Trevor quite appropriately -- compared. 
</P>
<P>
 "Excursions in the Real World" makes a suspiciously ironic title for these 
bits of autobiography and travel sketches. Curiously -- and significantly -- it 
is those with the least detail and elaboration, those that do more implying 
than recounting, that give us the greatest sense of reality. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps it is unfair. From a journalist or a lesser writer, the facts would do 
fine, but from Trevor we need more. We know the lookout is up there; unless he 
gives us a view beyond the one we get here below, we may feel he is inventing, 
or at least concealing. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, there are two pieces that convey the decrepit, damped-down feel of an 
out-of-date or out-of-season beach resort. One of them centers on a lavish 
seaside hotel in the winter, patronized by a few lonely habitues and a 
convention of car-battery salesmen. 
</P>
<P>
 There is plenty of ironic detail and observation, yet it feels like a piece of 
writing, something done for an occasion -- a magazine or newspaper commission, 
perhaps -- rather than a need. By contrast there is a visit to Youghal, a 
resort in County Cork, Ireland, where Trevor spent several early years. It is a 
featureless place and, in a few plain yet curiously elusive scenes and a phrase 
-- "a town that no one dislikes" -- Trevor captures not only the place, but a 
bit of childhood's bareness. 
</P>
<P>
 He takes the Orient Express. He writes in the sophisticated-picturesque mode 
-- something like the strained quality of Paul Theroux's traveling -- except 
for a moment when he shares a drink with an alcoholic abdominal surgeon. 
</P>
<P>
 Aren't shaky hands a problem? Trevor asks. They would be for an eye surgeon, 
the man explains, but not for a brain surgeon or for him. "The brain's quite 
large, you know. The stomach's enormous, people don't realize." 
</P>
<P>
 One of Trevor's fictional doors opens for a moment in a piece that otherwise 
feels like experience experienced for the purpose of writing about it. A like 
sense of commissioned sensibility comes from fairly ordinary pieces about New 
York; San Francisco; Venice, Italy; and, surprisingly, Dublin. 
</P>
<P>
 There are, to be sure, some engaging anecdotes and sketches. There is the 
blithe, egg-shaped and extremely shrewd Marchant Smith, who hired Trevor as an 
advertising trainee after he had failed the writing test at a larger firm. 
Marchant devised the "Tell me, doctor" series of ads for a pharmaceutical firm; 
after he died, someone suggested inscribing the line on his tombstone.  
</P>
<P>
 The Sylvia Plath-Ted Hughes story gets another perspective in a sketch of 
Assia, the charming Russian-Jewish emigre who floated in London literary 
circles and replaced Plath in Hughes' life. Trevor was a friend; he tells of a 
shaky Assia having a drink with him after she and Hughes broke up, and 
confessing through a "lavish smile" that she felt afraid. Weeks later, taking 
Plath's place once more, she killed herself and her small son in a gas oven. 
</P>
<P>
 There are pleasant but unremarkable sketches of life at boarding school, first 
as a student and later as a teacher. There is a much stronger portrait of his 
parents' marriage, which gradually froze over. 
</P>
<P>
 "Both laughed a lot but differently, and not in each other's company," Trevor 
writes, and tells us that they separated after the children grew up and they 
never saw each other again. It is vivid and desolating, but it lacks the sense 
of seeing beyond the story that can be found in so much of Trevor's fiction. 
</P>
<P>
 We get that sense in "The Strand," a seemingly artless description of a bit of 
beach he used to walk on, of a priest who used to strip and swim naked from it, 
of an abandoned house that belonged to an Englishman who suddenly went away. It 
ends with Trevor's stripped-down, laconic eloquence: 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no nostalgia here, only remembering facts -- and the point that 
passing time has made: the strand is still the strand, taking change and 
another set of mores in its stride, as people and houses cannot. While you walk 
its length, there is something comforting in that."

LET'S DO OUR PART, DON'T SHIRK; MINOR TEMPORARY INCREASES IN STATE TAXES TO DIG 
WAY OUT OF EARTHQUAKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Jan. 17 earthquake, whose magnitude is expected to be officially raised to 
6.8 by the National Earthquake Information Center, was the most powerful ever 
to affect a large U.S. population. It was also the costliest, with Gov. Pete 
Wilson's Administration now estimating losses at $13 billion to $20 billion. 
The question of how to pay for repairs and reconstruction remains as compelling 
as ever. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration and Congress, demonstrating one of the virtues of 
federalism, are on track to treat Southern California generously, with close to 
$9.5 billion in aid expected eventually. Private insurance payouts could total 
about $2.5 billion more. Wilson's office puts the state's repair cost at $1.9 
billion, with local governments facing a $135-million bill. Once upon a time 
the state could simply have tapped its considerable tax-revenue surplus to meet 
its obligations. But the cupboard has long since been emptied. How, then, 
should the state best meet its obligation? 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson continues to incline toward the slow, politically cautious and 
ultimately quite expensive route of a bond issue. Far more preferable, we 
think, is to apply pay-as-you-go financing to the repairs -- as was done in the 
aftermath of the 1989 Loma Prieta quake in the Bay Area -- using very modest, 
selective and temporary statewide tax hikes. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Quentin L. Kopp (I-San Francisco), chairman of the Transportation 
Committee, proposes boosting gasoline taxes a mere two cents a gallon for 3 1/2 
years to raise$1 billion for earthquake-related repairs and vitally needed 
seismic safety retrofitting of bridges, overpasses and the like. Our own 
earlier preference was for a larger gas tax over a shorter period, not least 
because the price of gasoline has fallen so much. However, the Legislature now 
has before it bills calling for the smaller gas tax and a temporary 
one-quarter-percent increase in the sales tax; the sales tax boost would yield 
$1.5 billion. These are affordable and equitable increases, and they are 
clearly necessary to help restore normal civic and economic life. Washington is 
ready to do its share. Now it's California's turn.

CLINTON HEALTH REFORM PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * The Administration's health care reform plan seeks to force as many 
Americans as possible to buy health care coverage exclusively through 
government bureaucracies called health alliances. Only a single health alliance 
would be available in a given area. 
</P>
<P>
 Initially the Clinton plan put all individuals and workers in firms of less 
than 5,000 employees in these government-run purchasing pools. Now, Treasury 
Secretary Lloyd Bentsen says the Administration will negotiate the ceiling down 
to cover only businesses of 500 or even 100 employees (Jan. 27). 
</P>
<P>
 Five thousand? Five hundred? One hundred? The Administration is in search of a 
magic number: the point at which enough voters are freed to seek coverage from 
all carriers to permit the capture of as many involuntary participants as 
possible. 
</P>
<P>
 No wonder. From a consumer's point of view the alliances are a Frankenstein 
monster, the result of stitching together the worst aspects of the public and 
private sector: bureaucracies and monopolistic cartels. Both lack the incentive 
to be either cost effective or consumer-friendly.  
</P>
<P>
 What's right in Clinton's health reform plan -- health care that's always 
there -- doesn't require a Frankenstein solution. It requires common sense and 
a focus on solving existing problems while not creating new ones. 
</P>

<P>
 * Guy Molyneux argues that excessive health care cost and denial of insurance 
coverage are reason enough to institute socialized medicine (Opinion, Jan. 30). 
I must point out that his demands for more coverage and thus more health care 
at a lower cost contradict each other. They conflict with the law of supply and 
demand which says that prices must rise as demand increases. 
</P>
<P>
 His demands cannot be met except by government fiat, price controls, and the 
forceful taking of value from one group for the benefit of another. People 
possessing satisfactory health care now will be disappointed with the outcome, 
as will the doctors coerced to provide more of it at a lower cost. 
</P>
<P>
 MARK POLLINA 
</P>
<P>
 Torrance 
</P>
<P>
 * A carefully orchestrated campaign again threatens the enactment of a 
national health care plan. As in President Truman's day, we are again hearing 
ominous threats of "socialized medicine"; we are now being told that there is 
no longer a health care emergency, as suddenly health care costs have stopped 
their precipitous rise, but only until a health care plan has again failed. 
</P>
<P>
 Wake up, America; one-third of our people have no health care coverage; infant 
mortality in this country is shamefully high; insurance premiums are escalating 
beyond the average wage earner's means; many with pre-existing illness can only 
obtain coverage at inflated cost; as a result of the economic downturn, those 
that have lost their jobs have also lost their coverage, and those who were 
long-time employees now have "pre-existing" illness when they try to get new 
insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 As a retired surgeon I strongly believe that although we do have the world's 
best in medical care, it is only available at present to probably half our 
people; is this what we really want? Under a national health care plan this 
care would be available to all who need it; good doctors would still be good 
doctors; money is not their primary motivation; good patient care, and the 
satisfaction of knowing that we have truly helped the sick are more important. 
</P>
<P>
 JERRY M. PINTO MD 
</P>
<P>
 San Diego 
</P>
<P>
 * Robert Rosenblatt's Jan. 28 article on the Wellstone-McDermott bill omits an 
essential aspect of the single-payer plan. That trillion-dollar tax bill over 
three years will be far less than three years at the present cost of insurance 
premiums, which do not cover the preventive and long-term care included in 
single-payer. Fewer than 10% of taxpayers would pay more in taxes than for 
present insurance premiums. Moreover, businesses large and small will be 
relieved of costly paperwork. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not revolutionary and it's not socialist. It's an extension of Medicare, 
a successful government-funded system that requires only 2% of its budget for 
office overhead, as against 20%-25% in the insurance industry.

COLUMN LEFT/ ARTHUR GERARD MELVILLE: MEXICO'S REAL TERRORISTS BEAR THE FLAG; 
CHIAPAS REPRESENTS ALL THOSE BETRAYED BY THEIR GOVERNMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ARTHUR GERARD MELVILLE, Arthur Gerard Melville is a psychotherapist in Long 
Beach and the author of With Eyes to See: A Journey From Religion to 
Spirituality (Stillpoint, 1992). The events described here occurred in the late 
1960s. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Having had the experience of being arrested and jailed in Chiapas, having been 
turned over to and mistreated by the Mexican army, and having been beaten and 
almost killed at the hands of the Mexican secret police, I feel a need to speak 
about the rebellion taking place there. 
</P>
<P>
 The uprising of the indigenous people in Chiapas in no way surprises me. What 
does surprise me is that these people have for so long endured their horrific 
condition, a result of purposeful neglect by the government and racist 
oppression by the large landowners. The brutal attempt by the Mexican 
government to suppress the uprising is also no surprise. Official corruption, 
white-collar crimes, fraudulent elections, incessant bribery, police brutality 
and drug-trafficking run rampant in Mexico. But when poor people stand up for 
their dignity and human rights, authoritative indignation in the form of 
official armed violence is the prompt response. 
</P>
<P>
 My knowledge of Chiapas comes from having lived for six years in the mountains 
of Huehuetenango, Guatemala, where I was accustomed to ride my horse across the 
border into the towns of Chiapas to buy provisions. My experience of Chiapas 
was both wonderful and sad. Never in my life have I met a more loving and 
generous people than the Mexican campesinos. Those with only one meal were 
willing to share it. A stranger had a place to stay. But it was always sad to 
see how these same people suffered. 
</P>
<P>
 Through my work as a Catholic priest among the peasants of Guatemala, I slowly 
realized that all legal means for attaining the rights of the poor had long 
been exhausted. After painstaking deliberation, I joined the Guatemalan 
Revolutionary Movement. I concluded that the movement was not violent per se, 
but was the only means left to the people for standing up to the 
institutionalized violence of the government. And since the Catholic Church had 
always sent its chaplains into the official armed conflicts of the wealthy, no 
matter how unjust the cause, I thought it appropriate that I, as a priest, 
should be part of a truly just armed conflict. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who enter the first stages of a revolutionary movement are not suicidal. 
They generally are people who have little to lose except their lives, and 
willingly give of themselves in order that their children and those that follow 
might have more. In conversations with the comandante of the Guatemalan 
movement's forces, a man who was to give his life, I learned of the commitment 
of people in taking the only dignified step left to them. 
</P>
<P>
 When my participation in the movement was discovered, I was condemned by 
ecclesiastical and governmental authorities and expelled from Guatemala. I 
spent the next four months "underground" in Mexico, much of that time in 
Chiapas, again witnessing Mayan Indians living in conditions similar to those 
of their people in Guatemala. One day, as I left San Cristobal de Las Casas, 
the focal point of the present uprising of the Zapatistas, I was arrested by 
border police and jailed. I then had the brief privilege of existing at the 
level of the indigenous poor and of gaining further insight into their 
oppression. From the jail I was taken to the army base in Tuxtla Gutierrez, the 
state capital, gaining additional insight into the plight of the poor who, 
forced into the military, are trained to fight against their own people. Turned 
over to the secret police, I was nearly murdered, saved only through the 
kindness and courage of a Mexican priest. 
</P>
<P>
 The uprising in Mexico is an infant compared to the war that the Guatemalan 
government has been waging against its people and their revolutionary forces, 
now in its 33rd year. Many seers and American business investors say that the 
revolt in Mexico will be short-lived. I doubt it, having seen the capacity of 
the people.  
</P>
<P>
 Since it is no longer politically correct to use the term communists for the 
revolutionaries of southern Mexico, with what despicable label will we insult 
the poor and oppressed who are now standing up for their rights? Terrorists 
seems to be the politically acceptable word. As the Mexican government claims 
that "professional terrorists" are leading the "simple Indians," what then do 
we call the real professional terrorists of the Mexican government and military 
who order bombings of civilian populations and summary executions of peasants?  
</P>
<P>
 It is unfortunate that the original inhabitants of that beautiful land are 
forced to take up the gun. Their present effort may be contained by the 
promoters of "progress," but since "free trade" is commonly known to be simply 
another step in putting the interests of the wealthy over those of the poor, I 
feel sure that what is happening now in Chiapas is only the beginning.

 One out of 12 job candidates lies about a college degree, contrasted with one

 Andler recalls one applicant who was caught claiming he went to the University

 Investors are "beginning to put two and two together: that whatever happened 
Friday was an aberration," said William LeFevre, senior market analyst at 
Ehrenkrantz King Nussbaum. 
</P>
<P>
 Many analysts say that while short-term interest rates may move higher this 
year, rates are still low enough to allow the bull market to continue. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, industrial stocks continued to lead Wall Street's rebound, indicating 
strong belief in the vitality of the economy's recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 Buyers were also cheered as bond yields eased a bit and oil prices slumped. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Wednesday's highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Industrial issues that rose sharply included AlliedSignal, up 2 1/2 to 79 
7/8; truck maker Paccar, up 2 1/4 to 59 1/2; Alcoa, up 1 1/8 to 80 1/2; Inland 
Steel, up 1 1/2 to 36 1/2; Rockwell, up 1 to 42 3/8; Federal Mogul, up 7/8 to 
37 1/2, and Timken, up 7/8 to 36 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
 The Big Three auto stocks, however, were hit by profit taking as Ford 
announced earnings. Ford eased 1 to 68 1/2, GM fell 1/2 to 64 1/4 and Chrysler 
was off 3/4 to 61 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Shipping stocks, which are also tied to the economy, rallied. American 
President soared 1 5/8 to 31 5/8, Roadway jumped 1 3/4 to 71 1/4 and 
Consolidated Freightways added 1 to 28 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
 Among airlines, USAir lost 5/8 to 13 1/2. Brokerage CS First Boston downgraded 
the stock to "hold" from "buy" and slashed earnings forecasts, citing USAir's 
new low fares. 
</P>
<P>
 * Investors snapped up many technology and telecommunications issues. Compaq 
surged 2 1/8 to 90, Adobe Systems gained 2 to 29 1/2, AST Research rocketed 1 
3/8 to 32 1/4 and 3Com shot up 3 to 63. 
</P>
<P>
 * On the downside, WMX Technologies fell 3 1/4 to 25. The waste management 
firm reported quarterly earnings below estimates. 
</P>
<P>
 In foreign trading, London's FTSE-100 index eased 11.1 points to 3,429.1 and 
Frankfurt's DAX index lost 21.92 points to 2,085.29. 
</P>
<P>
 In Tokyo, the Nikkei index slid 409.85 points to 19,841.38 on fears that the 
government's new fiscal stimulus plan won't be enough to halt the economy's 
slide. 
</P>
<P>
 In Mexico City, profit takers clipped 21.54 points off the Bolsa index, to 
2,859.63. Other Markets  
</P>
<P>
 Interest rates eased across the board as the Treasury sold $12 billion in 
10-year notes at an average yield of 5.92%, which was near expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 The yield on the Treasury's 30-year bond closed at 6.40%, down from 6.45% on 
Tuesday. Shorter-term yields also fell. 
</P>
<P>
 The bid-to-cover ratio on the 10-year notes, which measures the number of bids 
offered to the number accepted, was 2.58 to 1, a level about even with auction 
results over the past three years. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a decent auction that provided some hope for the market in terms of 
finding some sort of bottom after Friday's Fed tightening," said Anthony 
Karydakis, senior financial economist at First Chicago Capital Markets. 
</P>
<P>
 The Treasury concludes its quarterly refinancing today with the sale of new 
30-year bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, the bond market faces another test: The government reports on 
wholesale inflation in January. If the number is higher than expected, it could 
fuel fears that the Fed will tighten credit another notch sooner rather than 
later. 
</P>
<P>
 Many bond buyers are betting that the Fed's quarter-point increase in rates 
last week is not the first shot in a rapid succession of rate increases. 
However, bad news on the inflation front could force the Fed's hand. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere: 
</P>
<P>
 * Oil futures fell sharply on the New York Merc after weekly reports from the 
American Petroleum Institute and the Department of Energy showed unexpected 
increases in U.S. crude oil supplies, despite frigid weather in the East. 
</P>
<P>
 March crude futures tumbled 61 cents to $14.60 a barrel, a four-week low. 
</P>
<P>
 * Gold added $1.70 to $384 an ounce on the Comex; silver rose 6.5 cents to 
$5.34.

COMPUTER FILE / RICHARD O'REILLY: ECCO PROGRAMS REVERBERATE WITH PLUSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD O'REILLY, RICHARD O'REILLY is director of computer analysis for The 
Times. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Managing personal information with a computer seems to be a formidable task. 
At least, no standard way of going about it has developed, unlike word 
processing and spreadsheet software, for which there are more features in 
common than there are differences among the leading programs. 
</P>
<P>
 The key to the problem is the word personal , which is the tip-off that the 
information one person has to manage may be quite different from that of 
others. 
</P>
<P>
 There are a couple of needs most people have in common, however: schedules and 
telephone numbers. Thus, Ecco Simplicity ($79) and Ecco Professional ($395) 
from Arabesque Software Inc. of Bellevue, Wash. ((800) 457-4243) incorporate an 
excellent calendar for keeping track of appointments and a flexible phone book 
for keeping track of people. 
</P>
<P>
 But where many other programs don't offer much beyond a calendar and a phone 
book, those elements are only the beginning for Ecco. What really gives these 
personal information management programs their unique power are other features 
bearing the commonplace names "outline," "column" and, in Ecco Professional, 
"folder." 
</P>
<P>
 Ecco is a Windows program, running on IBM-compatible computers. It integrates 
well with other Windows programs, incorporating easy methods of exchanging 
information or linking directly to data in those programs. 
</P>
<P>
 In a single Ecco file you can store all the key information you need to do 
your job. You can keep track of all the people you deal with, including notes 
on every telephone conversation you have with them. You can maintain a schedule 
of all your appointments and commitments, including as many notes about each as 
you wish. Recurring events are easy to schedule, even for complicated cycle 
sequences. 
</P>
<P>
 You can keep track of every project or task you have to undertake and even 
create Gantt project management charts with Ecco Professional showing starting 
and completion dates for everything that must be accomplished. And you can 
instantly see which jobs you've assigned to each subordinate and how they are 
progressing. 
</P>
<P>
 The program will also help you write a report on your activities to your 
superiors. 
</P>
<P>
 Because Ecco is a Windows program, you can simultaneously have on your screen 
several different windows into the program, or "views" as Ecco calls them. 
</P>
<P>
 I found it useful in one view to split the screen vertically into two halves, 
displaying the telephone book, complete with alphabetical tabs, on the left 
side of my screen. The other side was the calendar, in which I could switch 
from seeing a single day, week or a month at a time with the click of a mouse 
button. 
</P>
<P>
 As a day progressed, I could quickly look up phone numbers, add names to my 
list, make appointments and respond to program alarms I set to make sure I got 
to meetings on time. 
</P>
<P>
 In between phone calls and meetings, I had another window superimposed over 
the first. It contained an outline of whatever project I needed to work on at 
the moment. In fact, I could have several outline views open at the same time 
and easily move among them as necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 An Ecco outline is simple to create and modify. Lines (or paragraphs) are not 
merely text. Each item is really a unit in an elaborate hierarchical database. 
When you indent an entry to the right or move it out to the left, you are 
actually changing its relationship to the other entries in that outline. 
</P>
<P>
 You can enhance outlines by adding what amount to spreadsheet-style columns to 
contain special data such as dates or amounts or a priority rating. 
</P>
<P>
 In Ecco Professional, each column (up to 50 of them) can be given a 
descriptive label and special formatting. 
</P>
<P>
 Outline items can be sorted by any column. For instance, you could establish a 
priority column for tasks and sort the outline so that each item was ranked 
according to its priority. 
</P>
<P>
 The final power feature of Ecco Professional is folders. You can create person 
folders or topic folders or project folders and use the mouse to drag into them 
copies of any item from an outline or a phone book or your calendar. The result 
is a great cross-referencing system that lets you simultaneously organize data 
in numerous ways. 
</P>
<P>
 To help you get started, Ecco comes with templates to use the program in a law 
office, for general-purpose management, project management, research and sales. 
</P>
<P>
 As I was learning the program, I used it to create an outline of its features 
and shortcomings. When I was finished, I used Ecco's "shooter" function to 
instantly send a copy of the outline's text into a word processing file, where 
I actually wrote the column. 
</P>
<P>
 I found only a few shortcomings. For instance, there is a feature in the phone 
book that allows you to log the date, time and duration of calls, in 
five-minute increments. But there are no instructions in the manual about how 
to print the call log client by client. (It's easy after technical support 
tells you the way to reformat the data displayed in that column.) 
</P>
<P>
 The pages that Ecco does print, such as calendar pages to fit popular 
notebooks from Franklin, Day Timer, Day Runner and LeFax, are beautifully 
formatted, complete with various font styles and sizes, drop shadow borders and 
shading. 
</P>
<P>
 But, at least on my venerable Hewlett-Packard LaserJet II, it takes a long 
time for those fancy graphics images to print.

POP MUSIC REVIEW; ONYX OFFERS OPPRESSIVE RANT ON RACE RELATIONS 
</P>

<P>
 Go to see Onyx -- the surly, intimidating New York rap quartet that played the 
Troubadour on Tuesday -- and you just may wind up a member of the Brotherhood 
of the Bruise. 
</P>
<P>
 Fans in front of the stage were engaged in hip-hop's version of the lost art 
of slam dancing, furiously banging into one another.You don't gently groove to 
Onyx, and if you walk out without a mark or two, then you weren't really into 
the show, which consisted of four scowling rappers venting their anger and 
frustration, mostly about the state of American race relations. 
</P>
<P>
 Onyx, which had a million-seller last year with its first album, effectively 
creates an atmosphere of ferocious anger and alienation. The group drags you 
into its raps, raging and swearing about the way blacks are treated in this 
country, which they've nicknamed the United States Ghetto. (Onyx's sensitivity 
to the problems of blacks didn't extend to the feelings of women, who got the 
crude sex-object treatment that's the disturbing standard in hard-core rap.) 
</P>
<P>
 A picture of pent-up fury, they stomped around the stage, constantly on the 
verge of explosion, ranting and raving to jarring beats that often sounded like 
shotgun blasts. After a while, all that relentless rage started to become 
oppressive. They even appeared to be mad at one another -- one member shoved 
another off the stage into the crush of slam dancers, who welcomed another body 
to batter. DENNIS HUNT

RECORD REVIEW; TERRIFIC LIVE CUTS BY R.E.M., U2 PROPEL 'NRG'; * * * VARIOUS

<TEXT>
<P>
 Terrific gimmick and some terrific music, though the real fuel of this 
solar-powered project is the dynamic superstar live performances of R.E.M. 
("Drive") and U2 (a soaring "Until the End of the World"). 
</P>
<P>
 It's impossible to maintain those highs throughout a 16-song compilation, but 
the disparate selections here are almost uniformly worthy.Top moments range 
from smoothie Annie Lennox to forceful Disposable Heroes of Hiphoprisy to 
rambunctious L7, while earnestly shambling troubadours James and dark 
noise-meisters the Jesus and Mary Chain and Sonic Youth also stand out. The one 
loser: Soundgarden with former Queen guitarist Brian May, a teaming that 
emphasizes the bombastic elements of each without their sometimes redeeming 
grace. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 New albums are rated on a scale of one star (poor), two stars (fair), three 
stars (good) and four stars (excellent).

JAZZ REVIEW; GENE HARRIS QUARTET HEATS UP CATALINA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD FEATHER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The members of the Gene Harris Quartet seem more like an assemblage of old 
friends than a group of musicians hired to play a gig. 
</P>
<P>
 At Catalina Bar & Grill, where they opened Tuesday for an unusual seven-day 
booking -- closing Monday (Valentine's Day) -- pianist Harris and his cohorts 
left no doubt that they are indeed longtime associates who find one another's 
company stimulating. 
</P>
<P>
 Guitarist Ron Eschete, a perfect creative and technical partner for Harris, 
cast knowing, cheerful glances at the leader on hearing him play some 
felicitous phrase. Paul Humphrey, the ideal small-group drummer, clearly was in 
his element underlining every rhythmic Harris nuance, while bassist Luther 
Hughes tied it all together with a firm tone and consistent beat. 
</P>
<P>
 The set started on an atypical low-key note with an old Thad Jones ballad, 
picked up a little with "This Masquerade," then slipped back with an 
undistinguished Stevie Wonder tune. 
</P>
<P>
 It was not until Harris turned on the heat with a seductive, 32-bar blues that 
the quartet's true power emerged. He is a master of the blues in every mood and 
tempo. In turn, he urged Eschete on to rocking indigo heights. 
</P>
<P>
 A 1930s pop tune, "Until the Real Thing Comes Along," provided fodder for the 
pianist's unique way with octaves, grace notes and tremolos. It was followed by 
another, longer blues -- one that was implicitly humorous. On that jubilant 
note, the set came to a delightfully crafted conclusion. LEONARD FEATHER

JUST PLAIN FOLK; DANCING SKILLS AND A SENSE OF COMMUNITY DEVELOP IN A CIRCLE 
(OR SQUARE OR LINE) OF FRIENDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN DUBIN, Zan Dubin covers the arts for The Times Orange County Edition. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bill Evans' eyes glazed over every week for months. The folk dance lessons 
weren't so easy after all. 
</P>
<P>
 But now he has joined scores of other folk dancers across Orange County who 
have developed a zeal that often borders on fanaticism. 
</P>
<P>
 "I live five minutes away," Evans said recently at the Fullerton park where he 
dances, "and I chose that apartment because it was close to here." 
</P>
<P>
 Like fancy underwear, there's a different folk dance class in the county for 
each night of the week. But whether it's Scottish or Cajun, square or 
Scandinavian dance they prefer, local practitioners share an all-too-rare sense 
of community, a passion for good, sober fun and highly developed calf muscles. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's great exercise," said Chino psychotherapist Anne Swanson Brown, beads of 
sweat dotting her forehead during a recent Israeli dance lesson in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown's classmate David Friedman, a Mission Viejo attorney, said: "I come for 
the physical (benefits) but also for the mental. For three or four hours, I 
forget all my problems, and I'm in another world where it's only music and good 
times." 
</P>
<P>
 Times haven't always been good for many forms of folk dance, which lack the 
popularity they had during their counterculture heyday of 20 or 30 years ago, 
said Robert Altman, president of Orange County Folkdancers. 
</P>
<P>
 As the idea of "making your own fun" became increasingly foreign to Americans, 
Altman said, folk dance clubs moved off college campuses into the private 
sector. And that, Altman said, meant vastly fewer young people being recruited 
and an increase in dancers' average age. 
</P>
<P>
 The proliferation of aerobics, martial arts, VCRs and competition from such 
popular music and dance forms as country didn't help either, according to folk 
aficionados. 
</P>
<P>
 So beginning this Friday, to drum up renewed interest, the Laguna Folkdancers 
group will offer its first introduction to international folk dance class at 
its 24th annual festival, a three-day event. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the area's major folk celebrations, the festival typically attracts 
about 400 enthusiasts from throughout Southern California, who come for 
workshops with local and noted visiting teachers, performances by local troupes 
and dance parties. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, several county groups are holding steady or going stronger than 
ever: INTERNATIONAL FOLK DANCE 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Folkdancers, Laguna Folkdancers and Veselo Selo Folkdancers all 
practice international folk dance, which, de spite the name, focuses on 
traditional cultures of Balkan and central European countries, parts of Russia 
and areas around the eastern Mediterranean Sea. 
</P>
<P>
 Dances may be easy, involving little more than walking and low kicks and hops, 
or intricate, brain-taxing endurance tests. There are solos, couple dances and 
group line dances, similar to country line dances except that participants hold 
each others' hands or grasp shoulders or belts. 
</P>
<P>
 Roughly 20 Laguna Folkdancers performed a Macedonian Lesnoto, clasping hands 
for the simple, lyrical line dance at a recent Sunday gathering. Wearing the 
soft, pointy-toed opanke sandal common among folk dancers, many hummed along to 
a soulful tune. 
</P>
<P>
 One participant candidly assessed the evening's crowd, made up of 30- and 
40-year-olds, as a bunch of fogies doing walking-around dances." 
</P>
<P>
 But, "a lot of young people are involved," countered Michelle Sandler, 37, a 
16-year folk dance veteran. "And if anyone wants to do more vigorous dances, 
they can request them." 
</P>
<P>
 Added Steve Himel, a Newport Beach computer programmer, "I like the variety 
that international folk dance offers." SQUARE DANCE 
</P>
<P>
 Considered one of America's own folk dances, square dancing is thriving here, 
due to such active organizations as Shirts 'N Skirts, turning 35 this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Its members hugging and chatting before a recent class, the group's palpable 
sense of community is emblematic of the local folk dance scene, where dancers 
take trips and celebrate birthdays, anniversaries and holidays en masse, and 
old-timers take pains to make newcomers feel welcome. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're working as a team with seven or eight people, so you depend on each 
other," said Dave Rensberger, a Shirts 'N Skirts dance caller. "And it's the 
whole spectrum of society; nobody cares what you do outside of square dancing." 
</P>
<P>
 Shirts 'N Skirts dances, held at Santa Ana's Ebell clubhouse, are a step back 
in time: The spitting image of the decals seen on many an RV, these beaming 
petticoated ladies and bolo-tied gents do-si-do and promenade to Rensberger's 
singsong calls: "Circle to the right left with a yak yak yak, dance up to the 
middle with a whoop and a holler." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, today's square dancing has evolved from its English and French roots 
into a more complex art with hundreds of movements and patterns. Lessons are 
mandatory. Shirts 'N Skirts' next 10-month session for beginners will start in 
January. 
</P>
<P>
 While dancers range from age 13 to eightysomething, the average Shirks 'N 
Skirts member is 40, and women tend to outnumber men. Cornering a visiting 
reporter, Cathy McLeod of Newport Beach worked to amend that. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tell all the guys in town," said McLeod, a vision in pink, "if they want to 
meet some really nice gals, and pretty ones too, they should come to the Ebell 
club. And tell them to bring a guy with them." 
</P>
<P>
 "The best thing about square dancing is that there's no drinking," offered Peg 
Bogard, a Huntington Beach businesswoman. "It's not a written rule, but if 
you're drinking, you're not thinking, which would screw up three other 
couples." SCOTTISH 
</P>
<P>
 Wanna-be folk dancers may be lured to this brand just by the names of its 
jigs: Sandy O'er the Lea, Misses Cramb of Linlithgow, Jessie's Hornpipe, 
Dashing White Sergeant, Sugar Candie, De'il Amang the Tailors. 
</P>
<P>
 The curious should have a taste for refinement too. Scottish dance, with its 
origin in the royal French court, demands precise lower-leg articulation, 
proper deportment and "has all the etiquette of polite society of a day gone 
by," said instructor Bob Patterson. 
</P>
<P>
 "You escort your partner off the floor," said Patterson, who teaches at the 
Edison Community Center in Huntington Beach. "You don't slump." 
</P>
<P>
 Even, however, while striving to keep toes pointed and heels elevated, 
students at a recent class seemed to be having no less fun than that De'il 
Amang the Tailors. 
</P>
<P>
 "The music is upbeat, and people have a good time," said Linda Boucher, a 
retired art teacher. "It's a real mental challenge because there are so many 
different combinations of steps, but you end up feeling like you've really 
accomplished something." ROUND DANCING 
</P>
<P>
 The lack of a major mental challenge is the allure of Round Dancing, named 
after dancers' circular progression around the room. 
</P>
<P>
 The "lazy-man's ballroom," its followers perform simplified versions of the 
waltz, tango, swing, fox trot, samba and other social dances, said Harmon 
Jorritsma, who teaches with his wife, Betty, in Orange and Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 "We dance for enjoyment and fun," Jorritsma said, "and we have our own rules, 
but they aren't very strict." 
</P>
<P>
 Additionally, a caller cues each new move so that men don't have to 
choreograph on their feet, a ballroom must. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's so great to be able to dance and not have to make anything up," said 
round dancer John Guerin, 63, as couples swirled slowly by during Jorritsma's 
recent Anaheim session. Most of the swirlers were were in their 70s and 80s; 
some have been at it for more than a quarter-century. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're celebrating a 60th wedding anniversary tonight," said Betty Jorritsma, 
whose class numbered about 100 recently. "I send birthday cards to everyone 
too." 
</P>
<P>
 ISRAELI 
</P>
<P>
 Slapping the ground, skipping, whistling, whooping and raising their hands 
skyward to God, Israeli dancers at a recent Costa Mesa class hardly paused for 
breath between songs. 
</P>
<P>
 " Yassou! " one called out. " Opa! " called another. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the dances Yoni Carr teaches every Wednesday night are old classics. 
There's erev ba , a circle dance like the hora, and bat yiftch , a couples 
dance. 
</P>
<P>
 Some, on the other hand, are brand-new. 
</P>
<P>
 "We get the latest dances from Israel by fax," said Uri Hazan. "I'm not 
kidding!"

 Swanson Brown, 36, drives 40 minutes each way to attend Carr's group. She 
prefers it over those that have more of a "night club" atmosphere, which has 
"broken up a lot of marriages," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They turn down the lights and have a lot more couple dances." 
</P>
<P>
 "We get people from San Diego, Pomona, wherever," Friedman said. "Sometimes we 
have up to 100." SCANDINAVIAN 
</P>
<P>
 Warning: Couple-dance phobics, don't apply. Scandinavian dancers don't whirl 
arm-in-arm around the floor. They whirl bear-hug around the floor. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not because Scandinavians are friendlier, more affectionate people," 
explained Donna Tripp, who teaches dances of Norway, Sweden, Denmark and 
Finland with Ted Martin in Anaheim for the 30-year-old Skandia Dance Club. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Swedish polska hold is used, Tripp said, because couples execute 
different steps, while, like the Earth around the sun, they're rotating as one 
unit and circling the room. If not exactly a bear hug, it's a much more 
intimate coupling position than typically seen. 
</P>
<P>
 "It gives a very firm position in regard to the partner and allows for closer 
contact and better centering of the dance," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tripps' students learn mostly traditional Scandinavian forms of waltz, 
schottische, polka and other couple dances that involve walking and turning, 
with lots of variations on that theme. 
</P>
<P>
 Amy Dale likes the challenge. "It looks deceptively simple," she said, "but 
it's not." 
</P>
<P>
 Like just about every folk group around the county, this one functions, even 
if not by design, as a singles group, with plenty of happy endings. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had probably 10 or 12 marriages grow out of this" group, said Tripp, 
who has spent most of her life in dance, whether ballet or folk, and likes to 
quote that like-minded comic strip canine. 
</P>
<P>
 "As Snoopy says, 'To live is to dance, and to dance is to live.' "

STEP TO THE RIGHT BEAT FOR YOUR FEET

<P>
 Scottish? Israeli? Cajun? How to choose the sort of folk dance for you? 
</P>
<P>
 Veteran folk dancer and teacher Donna Tripp suggests international folk dance 
for first-timers.It involves lots of line dances (versus couple dances), which 
tend to be simpler and don't require a partner. 
</P>
<P>
 Experienced dancers new to folk dance have to follow their own inclinations, 
Tripp said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The music or the form of dance may stimulate them, for instance. And age has 
a lot to do with it. The older dancer may find Hungarian, Polish and Russian 
dances much too exhausting." 
</P>
<P>
 But whatever your choice, all groups welcome newcomers, so feel free to call 
or go observe and ask questions. Be prepared to try at least a few steps the 
first time out -- folkies are friendly. 
</P>
<P>
 Wear comfortable clothes and low-heeled shoes. You'll see skirts, sweats, 
slacks and shorts, and, for footwear, everything from boots to tennies. 
</P>
<P>
 Also helpful is the Folk Dance Federation of California, South, at (310) 
478-6600. The group publishes Folk Dance Scene magazine, which includes a 
monthly event calendar. 
</P>
<P>
 Most groups do not require partners but call to verify.

COMEDY: LENDING HIS VOICE; STAND-UP VENTRILOQUIST DAN HORN INTERACTS WITH 
PUPPETS FOR LAUGHS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GLENN DOGGRELL, Glenn Doggrell writes about comedy for the The Times Orange 
County Edition. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dan Horn has spawned an odd family. 
</P>
<P>
 Cassandra, his first-born, was conceived to be brash and obnoxious.  
</P>
<P>
 Orson, who is much older but came second (true story), was created to be 
grumpy and curmudgeonly. 
</P>
<P>
 Little Gary, a wooden-headed sort, is a self-parody of Horn. 
</P>
<P>
 Hardly the bunch Mr. Brady would assemble, but they all look up to Horn and 
turn to him for guidance. And in doing so, they have managed to earn a good 
living for the Arizona resident, who responds by stuffing them in trunks and 
hiring them out across the country, including a stop at the Brea Improv through 
Sunday.  
</P>
<P>
 "Cassandra was just a puppet I made to be the spunky, saucy, smart-aleck 
character," the stand-up ventriloquist said from his home in Chandler, near 
Phoenix, while trying to feed his infant son as his wife and daughter, 7, ran 
errands. "She was the Charlie McCarthy prototype, brash and obnoxious." 
</P>
<P>
 Orson's origins were more rooted in reality, and it didn't take him long to 
supplant Cassandra as the favored child. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had lots of aunts and uncles in our family, and I put Orson together to 
entertain family," continued Horn, who chose the name Orson because it wasn't a 
puppet-y name. "At the same time, I was doing open-mike nights with Cassandra, 
and someone suggested doing Orson, too. I said no, but I got bored after a few 
months with just Cassandra, so I did it to see." 
</P>
<P>
 The results were impressive. It seems everyone had a relative or a friend that 
was crusty on the outside, soft on the inside. 
</P>
<P>
 "There seemed to be a lot more that could be done with an elderly puppet," 
said Horn, 35. "I could find more material with a dirty old man." 
</P>
<P>
 Soon Orson was opening the show. More than 15 years later, Orson is still 
going strong.  
</P>
<P>
 "I think that's mainly because of the difference of the character," Horn said, 
referring to his interactive style and the soft-sculptured, cloth characters he 
uses as opposed to carved, wooden dummies. "Everyone had Charlie McCarthy for 
so long. Orson goes over well because people haven't seen him so much. I was 19 
when he was originated. He has a background. I react to him as if he were a 
real person." 
</P>
<P>
 Often on stage, when the puppet talks, the ventriloquist takes himself out of 
the show. He's more of a straight man. That's where Horn sets himself apart. He 
laughs at his puppets. He goads them.  
</P>
<P>
 "I have to react when Orson talks. That was something I consciously worked on, 
creating two personas." 
</P>
<P>
 That's where Little Gary fits in. He's the wooden dummy Orson uses to do 
traditional ventriloquism to parody Horn.  
</P>
<P>
 "Everything he does is the ventriloquism stereotype. Hopefully, what I do is 
get away from that." 
</P>
<P>
 A typical bit between Orson and Gary goes like this: 
</P>
<P>
 Orson: "What's your favorite class in school?" 
</P>
<P>
 Gary: "Wood shop." 
</P>
<P>
 Orson: "What are you building?" 
</P>
<P>
 Gary: "A date." 
</P>
<P>
 Horn's other characters include E.P. (short for extra puppet) and Polly Ester 
(a matronly type). And audience members should be forewarned: Horn's show 
includes an often-hilarious portion in which he brings a volunteer on stage and 
attaches oversized marionette sticks to his or her wrists to manipulate the 
arms as Horn provides the voice. Think of Mr. T's voice coming from a woman. 
</P>
<P>
 Horn started throwing his voice 30 years ago in Phoenix when he 5. Today, he's 
on the road about 36 weeks a year, performing at comedy clubs, casinos, 
colleges and conventions. 
</P>
<P>
 He has worked with Jay Leno, Howie Mandel and Rita Rudner. He has also 
entertained fans on Showtime, "Evening at the Improv" and "Comic Strip Live."  
</P>
<P>
 He's a hit with his peers, too. Last July, he was voted 1993-94 ventriloquist 
of the year at the annual International Ventriloquist Convention at Fort 
Mitchell, Ky. 
</P>
<P>
 But none of that guarantees Horn recognition. 
</P>
<P>
 At the convention, he was asked, "Can I get an autograph, Jeff?" A humbling 
request, given that Jeff is Jeff Dunham, Horn's competition. 
</P>
<P>
 "Actually, Jeff and I get along very well, and the more Jeff does, it's good 
for me. Because if people think I'm him, I get more exposure," Horn said, 
laughing. 
</P>
<P>
 And as a proud parent, he can afford to laugh these days. His act, sometimes 
racy but always entertaining, is in demand. His peers respect him. His kids 
respond to him. 
</P>
<P>
 But above all, they always say what he tells them to. 
</P>
<P>
 MORE COMEDY: 
</P>
<P>
 To appreciate Kathleen Madigan is to appreciate Midwestern humor, which 
includes such heartland subjects as hunting, cow-tipping and bowling. ("I was 
drunk and needed the shoes." But she gives bowlers credit. "I think they're 
steroid-free.") The Missouri native performs at the Irvine Improv through 
Sunday, Feb. 20. (714) 854-5455.

MESS FOR SUCCESS: DON'T WORRY, NEATNESS DOESN'T COUNT IN THE RAUCOUS 
NICKELODEON LIVE TOUR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICK VANDERKNYFF, Rick VanderKnyff is a free-lance writer who contributes 
regularly to The Times Orange County Edition. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Onstage, the Nickelodeon Live Tour has the trappings and energy of a rock 
concert, complete with hockey-arena setting and screaming fans. But backstage, 
the glamour quotient isn't quite the same, says host Phil Moore. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's more like, 'I can't get this whipped cream off me. Look, I got slime on 
my shoes,' " Moore said with a laugh Sunday after a show in Minneapolis. "It's 
got that rock 'n' roll feel, with that Nickelodeon smell." 
</P>
<P>
 The Nickelodeon Live Tour, which comes to the Anaheim Arena on Saturday for 
two shows, is a touring compendium of the often-raucous children's shows that 
air on the cable network. That means participants, from the audience, are 
likely to get a cream pie in the face or doused in buckets of green slime. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, moms and dads, that means you, too. In fact, it may be your own precious 
little ones who do the sliming. Gleefully. "Dress to make a mess," Moore 
cautioned. 
</P>
<P>
 The event borrows some of the games of last year's Double Dare Tour, including 
William Tell. In that game, mothers aim toilet plunger "arrows" at targets that 
will dump slime on fathers' heads. In Musical Pies, a cream pie is passed 
around until the music stops, and, well, we'll let you guess the rest. 
</P>
<P>
 Featured prominently in the current 70-stop tour are games from Moore's own 
show, "Nick Arcade," in which participants are placed in video-game settings. 
Also featured are stunts from the show "Guts," including an obstacle course for 
kids, a basketball game in which players are suspended from elastic cords, and 
the Agro Crag, a climbing game complete with avalanches and snowstorms. 
</P>
<P>
 "Guts" host Mike O'Malley is Moore's co-host for the Live Tour. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents are invariably good sports about the proceedings, Moore said, adding 
that one of the tour's strong points is that it allows families to take part 
together. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is totally interactive. Kids maybe see a side of their parents they've 
never seen before, and parents see the enthusiasm of their kids." 
</P>
<P>
 The secret of the stunts and games, Moore said, is that they've taken things 
that kids do and blown them up larger than life. With the basketball game, for 
instance, "they're like Neil Armstrong on the moon. There's no way you can be a 
kid and not want to do that." 
</P>
<P>
 After the Anaheim date, the tour moves to the Los Angeles Sports Arena for a 
Sunday show. 
</P>
<P>
 What: Nickelodeon Live Tour. 
</P>
<P>
 When: Saturday, Feb. 12, at 1:30 and 4:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Where: Anaheim Arena, 2695 E. Katella Ave., Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 Whereabouts: From the Orange (57) Freeway, exit at Katella Avenue and go east. 
Turn left almost immediately into the arena parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
 Wherewithal: $12.50-$17.50. 
</P>

 Where to call: (714) 704-2500 (box office).

REWIND: TANTALIZING AURA FUELS 'GASLIGHT' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JON MATSUMOTO "Gaslight" (1944), directed by George Cukor. 114 minutes. Not 
rated. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Charles Boyer is probably best remembered as the quintessential Gallic 
heartthrob of the 1930s and '40s. 
</P>
<P>
 But Boyer may have turned in his most memorable performance when he played 
against his suave and romantic screen image in George Cukor's psychological 
mystery-drama, "Gaslight." In this 1944 film, the usually debonair Frenchman 
brings to chilling life the character of Gregory Anton, a manipulative and 
ruthless composer who tries to drive his naive wife, Paula (Ingrid Bergman, in 
an Oscar-winning performance), insane. 
</P>
<P>
 When this Victorian period film opens, an underage Paula is in the process of 
moving out of her home in an upscale area of London. It is revealed that her 
aunt and guardian -- a revered opera singer -- has been murdered and that the 
young girl is moving to Italy in an attempt to distance herself from that 
traumatic event and to further her own budding singing career. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten years later, Paula falls in love with Gregory. The couple quickly marry, 
and Gregory persuades his new bride to move back to the London estate that she 
inherited from her aunt. 
</P>
<P>
 But after the couple make the trek from Italy to England, Gregory's behavior 
suddenly turns cryptic and overbearing. He refuses to allow Paula to socialize 
and insists that she is becoming alarmingly forgetful and paranoid. 
</P>
<P>
 A virtual prisoner in her own home, Paula's vivacious spirit begins to wither. 
</P>
<P>
 What keeps "Gaslight" burning is its tantalizing aura of mystery. The question 
is, why is Gregory trying to drive Paula out of her mind? The clues arrive in 
bits and pieces, and eventually it's evident that Gregory has a secret past 
connected to Paula and her aunt. 
</P>
<P>
 "Gaslight," based on a play by Patrick Hamilton, is also buttressed by three 
strong supporting performances. A fresh-faced Angela Lansbury is appealingly 
impudent as the housemaid; Dame May Whitty brings a comedic dimension to her 
role as a nosy neighbor, and Joseph Cotten has his moments as a well-bred 
fellow determined to get to the bottom of the strange goings-on at the Anton 
residence. 
</P>
<P>
 "Gaslight" is so named for the mysteriously temperamental gas lamps in Paula's 
bedroom. JON MATSUMOTO "Gaslight" (1944), directed by George Cukor. 114 
minutes. Not rated.

WANNA DANCE?: THERE'S PEER PLEASURE AT METROPOLIS 
</P>

 Metropolis' newest gig, PleasureDome, may just be the sexiest young thing in 
the county. 
</P>
<P>
 From the pulsating grooves to many of the fashionable patrons, the Sunday-only 
event oozes with sex appeal. Beefy, Chippendales-like go-go dancers shake it on 
the go-go platforms, while screens show colorfully abstract videos of studly 
men, and another screen features a live shadow dancer. A state-of-the-art 
computerized light and sound system drenches the whole scene, which includes 
the distribution of free condoms, bearing the Metropolis logo, from 
CondomRevolution in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 Healthy attendance at last week's opening reflected an open-minded mix of 
sexes and sexual preferences, unified for the sole reason of getting in one 
more night of partying before the weekend is officially over. 
</P>
<P>
 DJ Eddie-X of Los Angeles' Temple-fame rotates an infectious run of house 
music that -- as the crowd showed -- was hard to resist. Dance fools who 
haven't visited Metropolis in months because they didn't like the obtrusive 
posts that split up the dance floor will love the recent changes: The posts are 
gone, consolidating the area into an open space.  
</P>
<P>
 The go-going Fettish Boys, clad in very little, elicit tips from onlookers of 
both sexes. On opening night, one Fettish Boy dressed in an original Van Buren 
sequined wind-breaker and mesh top studded with the letters F, A, G. 
In-your-face fashion is always the most fabulous. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the free condoms, you practitioners of social responsibility will 
appreciate that drinking beer here can actually help a local AIDS organization. 
Sunday marked the Metropolis debut of Pink Triangle, a micro-brewed light beer 
that, according to promotional cards on the club's tables, was "created for the 
nation's Lesbian and Gay Community." The Iowa-based brewery promises to donate 
no less than 25% of its profits to AIDS organizations in areas where the beer 
is sold.  
</P>
<P>
 Still, Pink Triangle didn't outdo the night's $2 drink specials of 16-ounce 
drafts of Bud, Coors Light and Miller Genuine Draft. After 9 p.m., the price of 
each rises to $3.25. Imported brews are $4 all night. Also at the bar: wells, 
$3.75; premiums, $4.25 to $5, and glasses of wine run $3.75 to 4.75. Bottled 
water and sodas are $2. 
</P>
<P>
 Metropolis's in-house sushi bar, Octopussy, serves it up from 7 to 11 p.m. 
Selections are $3 to $12. The kitchen also has available California cuisine, 
such as salads, pastas and sandwiches, $5 to $7. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the dance floor and main bar saw the greatest action on opening night 
(it took considerable patience to maneuver those areas or just to order a 
drink), the gorgeous rosewood pool tables were never wanting for players, even 
at $12 an hour.

 MORE CLUBS: 
</P>
<P>
 Tango, at Mum's, 144 Pine Ave., Long Beach. (310) 437-7700. Fridays only, 9 
p.m. to 2 a.m. Cover: $10 (but passes are available). Hosted by Indigo 
Productions, Tango has all the energy, dress-to-impress attitude and cordial 
spirit of that outfit's other promotions, such as Thursday night disco at 
Roxbury South in Santa Ana. The mainstream dance pop doesn't earn the club any 
points in the music department (head on up to the roof to hear old school, new 
wave and classic KROQ), but with so many folks gettin' down and having a 
genuine good time, who's keeping score? Certainly not the stylish 
twentysomethings now packing the place. 
</P>
<P>
 Soul Shack at Club 5902, 5902 Warner Ave., Huntington Beach. (714) 840-6118. 
Sundays only, 9 p.m. to 2 a.m. Cover: $4. The musical fare at Soul Shack is 
decidedly fresh and too funky to sit out. Along with early rap, deejay Beej 
rotates a prime selection of rare groove vinyl (translated as '60s and '70s 
funk-heavy tracks) and acid jazz. Live bands also keep the dancers moving. 
All-night drink specials are a plus if the earlier part of the weekend just 
about emptied your wallet. 
</P>
<P>
 Mango, 353 E. Coast Highway, Newport Beach. (714) 673-7800. Open Tuesday 
through Saturday from 5:30 p.m. to 10 p.m. for dinner, club is open from 9:30 
p.m. to 2 a.m.; Sunday 1 p.m. to 2 a.m. Closed Monday. Cover: $5. This new hot 
spot seems plucked right out of Miami's trendy South Beach. It's a place where 
fans of cumbia, mambo, salsa, calypso and even New Orleans jazz can savor those 
rhythms, as furnished by an assortment of live bands. The dance floor is rather 
small, but bumping into and rubbing against other dancers is part of any decent 
salsa club scene.  
</P>
<P>
 Orange County's Music City, 18774 Brookhurst St., Fountain Valley. (714) 
963-2366. Open 7 p.m. to 2 a.m. Wednesday, Thursday and Saturday; 5 p.m. to 2 
a.m. Friday. No cover on Wednesdays and Thursdays; $5 cover after 8 p.m. on 
Fridays and Saturdays. This place used to be known as the Hop, a '50s and '60s 
nostalgia club owned by Righteous Brother Bill Medley. As Music City, it's 
entered a new era, focusing mostly on music of the '60s and '70s, though other 
eras still surface occasionally. Cover bands interpret their favorite oldies, 
alternating nights with the recorded versions.  
</P>
<P>
 Dante's, 1701 Corinthian Way, Newport Beach. (714) 955-3821. Open Monday and 
Tuesday 11 a.m. to 11:30 p.m., Wednesday and Thursday 11 a.m. to midnight, 
Friday 11 a.m. to 1:30 a.m., and Saturday 5 p.m. to 1:30 a.m. Closed Sundays. 
No cover. Newport Beach might be the last place you'd expect to label a hotbed 
of gypsy music, but it's here that the trio known as Vladamer, Grigorii and 
Misha perform Eastern European traditional tunes and vintage cabaret favorites. 
A small dance floor accommodates those who just can't contain themselves.  
</P>
<P>
 The Lord Nelson, 1464 S. Coast Highway, Laguna Beach. (714) 494-5707. Open 
daily at 11:30 a.m. Closing time varies Sunday through Thursday, depending on 
customers; open Friday and Saturday till 2 a.m. Cover: $1 on Thursday nights; 
$3 (occasionally more) on Friday and Saturday. Thursday nights at this 
English-style pub feature some of the most innovative programming in the 
county. That's when, in an evening dubbed the B-Side, deejay Tony Vick plays a 
mix of Brazilian, acid jazz, Arabic disco, hippie pop, glam, punk and just 
about anything else. Friday and Saturday nights feature live local bands for 
cheap, and the dinner menu features bangers and mash. Who could ask for more? 
</P>
<P>
 Electric Circus, 314 N. Beach Blvd., Anaheim. (714) 826-9686. Open daily, 4 
p.m. to 2 a.m. No cover Sunday through Tuesday and on Thursday; Wednesday is 
$3, $5 for ages 18 to 21; Friday and Saturday, $2-$3. This newly opened, 
6,500-square-foot venue is a diamond in the rough that could rank among the 
county's brightest party sites in '94. The decor is a mix of neo-baroque and 
industrial -- plush fabrics, Roman-style pillars, chipped concrete flooring. 
Even the nine billiards tables look elegant, topped in red felt. Unlike the 
yuppie clientele found at the county's other upscale pool hall nightclubs 
(Shark Club, Metropolis), Electric Circus attracts the kind of 18 and older 
scenesters who are often categorized under alternative.  
</P>
<P>
 The White House, 340 South Coast Highway, Laguna Beach. (714) 494-8088. Open 
Tuesday through Friday 7 a.m. to 2 a.m., Saturday through Monday 8 a.m. to 2 
a.m. Cover: varies, up to $4. More than two dozen Tiffany lamps hang through 
this narrow bar space, where a very long, varnished bar is crowded nightly with 
"locals" from near and far chatting over a glass of wine or a 16-ounce schooner 
of beer. Live rock and reggae bands play nightly, drawing a crowd of mostly 
twenty- to fortysomethings who continuously cram the small dance floor.  
</P>
<P>
 Tiki Bar, 1700 Placentia Ave., Costa Mesa. (714) 548-3533. Open daily, 11 a.m. 
to 2 a.m. Cover: $3 Thursday through Saturday. This 2,000-square-foot space 
(formerly the Newport Roadhouse) with a "Gilligan's Island"-type decor sits in 
an industrial spread that is home to some of the heavier hitters in the 
action-wear industry. So it comes as no surprise that the crowd here is 
generally clad in what would otherwise be worn on the beach or the slopes, and 
only a few patrons are over age 30. A dozen televisions continuously run surf, 
skateboard and snowboard videos, while a deejay spins everything from the 
Village People to Stone Temple Pilots.

CLASSIC OF THE WEEK: DESI ARNAZ: "THE BEST OF DESI ARNAZ THE MAMBO KING" 
(1946-49) RCA  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY LEWIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Television has a nasty habit of playing havoc with reality. Ask 100 people to 
identify Desi Arnaz, and 99 will describe the volcano-tempered Latin chauvinist 
who was constantly bailing Lucy out of hot water on "I Love Lucy." Even though 
Arnaz portrayed a Cuban bandleader on the show, his real-life reputation as a 
popular musical innovator has been all but obscured by the phenomenal success 
of his comedic partnership with wife Lucille Ball. 
</P>
<P>
 With the Nickelodeon cable channel poised to air 25 uncut "I Love Lucy" 
episodes next week, it's an ideal time to give due credit to Arnaz's pre-TV 
career. RCA inexplicably waited until 1992 to make any of his catalogue 
available on CD. This was the first "world music" I encountered, having grown 
up listening to an album of Arnaz's 78s that my parents owned. Hearing the 
music on this 16-track compilation for the first time in maybe two decades, I'm 
impressed all over again at the ferocity Arnaz captured in his 
percussion-driven theme song, "Babalu," the grace his Latin big band applied to 
the instrumental "Brazil" and the silly fun he had with a quasi-novelty number 
like "Cuban Pete" ("They call me Cuban Pete / I'm the king of the rumba beat / 
When I play the maracas I go chick-chickee-boom chick-chickee-boom"). 
</P>
<P>
 He played to the stereotype of the Latin leading man to an extent by recording 
such pseudo-Cuban numbers as "A Rainy Night in Rio," written for a movie by 
Arthur Schwartz and Leo Robin. But in his renditions of genuinely Latin 
material like "Guadalajara," Arnaz created a sound bridging traditional Cuban 
music with American pop, a sound that helped spur the mambo craze of the '40s 
and '50s. So during next week's Nickelodeon marathon, around the time Ricky 
Ricardo is screaming "Luuuuu-cyyyyyy!" for the 19th time, throw this on and 
remember how much more that voice was really capable of. RANDY LEWIS

NEW PICK OF THE WEEK: ROSALIE SORRELS: "WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO LOVE?" GREEN 
LINNET  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE BOEHM 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If you want a quick, Valentine's-card answer to the question that Sorrels, one 
of the great figures of American folk music, poses in this album's title, you 
should turn elsewhere. It takes her more than an hour to explore her theme, 
but, as she says at one point, quoting Colette on child-raising, "It is 
important not to be in a hurry." 
</P>
<P>
 Sorrels comes at love from surprising, often oblique angles as she strings 
together the varied pearls of her distinctive performing style. There are a 
cappella songs and songs with light string-band accompaniment, delivered in a 
lived-in but lovely voice, as well as literary readings and personal musings 
that she invests with the folksiness and flair of a natural storyteller. The 
album, like one of the 60-year-old Idaho woman's remarkable concerts, is a 
continuum that's both wonderfully warm and keenly thought-provoking. 
</P>
<P>
 For Sorrels, the primary loving relationship is not between romantic partners. 
That bond, she suggests in her beautiful original song "Apples and Pears," is 
often too brittle to last. She spends more time dwelling on how goodness and 
care for life's most generative things (nature, the play of the imagination) 
are transmitted. For her, it's the adult-to-child bond that's key. 
</P>
<P>
 Sorrels has shown elsewhere that she can be dark and wrenching. Here she 
concentrates on promoting the positive in segments that set out the slowing of 
time, closeness to nature and a fascination for the mind's inventive 
possibilities as prerequisites for a loving life. She takes a wry swipe at 
television as the enemy and takes pains to rescue Malvina Reynolds' lovely 
"Turn Around" ("Where are you going my little one, little one") from its 
long-ago entombment in a TV commercial. 
</P>
<P>
 She ends with a masterful, 26-minute reading of Rudyard Kipling's tale "The 
Cat That Walked by Himself." With it (or, at least, by its implications), 
Sorrels makes the case that the capacity for self-love, exemplified by the 
cat's pride, wit and independence, has a lot to do with the answer to her title 
question. 
</P>
<P>
 Sorrels' work is warm, suffused with an intelligence molded by experience, and 
loving. If you were wondering what the exact antithesis of the "Beavis and 
Butt-head" experience might be in popular culture, here it is. MIKE BOEHM

DO IT!: RAIN OR SHINE, THIS RUN IS AN ADVENTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 On the morning of last year's Great American Adventure Run at Central Park in 
Huntington Beach, Oscar J. Rosales woke up to what would normally be a race 
director's nightmare: rain, lots of it. 
</P>
<P>
 "It poured bloody murder," Rosales recalled in a phone interview. But the 
runners didn't seem to mind. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have more people telling me this year, 'Gosh, I hope it rains again.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The race returns Saturday. The event, with courses of 2.8 and 4.8 miles, 
attracted 350 runners, about what Rosales would have expected on a sunny day. 
Rosales attributes that to the hardiness of the people attracted to his events, 
which eschew the streets for a lush park setting and courses that include dirt 
and grass as well as asphalt pathways. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's nothing like a road race. It's totally rural and cross-country," Rosales 
said, adding that first-timers to his Central Park events -- which include the 
Hillsea in May and the Sunset in the Park in September -- are often surprised 
at how different the experience is from road races. 
</P>
<P>
 The 2.8-mile event begins at 8 a.m.; the 4.8-mile run starts at 8:30 a.m. 
Runners who enter both events are eligible for special plaques, in addition to 
the regular awards for age-group winners in each individual race. 
</P>
<P>
 Records for the 2.8-mile course are 14 minutes, 36 seconds, by Matt Messner 
for the men and 16:37 by Beth Metcalf for the women. Metcalf also holds the 
women's record for the 4.8-mile course, at 28 minutes; Alfredo Rosas holds the 
men's record at 23:27. 
</P>
<P>
 Race-day registration for the event will open at 6:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Also on Saturday, they'll be running off-road deep in the Cleveland National 
Forest, in the latest edition of the Winter Trail Run Series. The 22-kilometer 
race begins, as all the events do, at Blue Jay Campground (five miles north of 
El Cariso Village off Ortega Highway, 22 miles east of San Juan Capistrano). 
</P>
<P>
 The run begins at 8 a.m. Race-day entry price is $23. Future events include a 
12K on Feb. 26 ($12) and a 50K run on March 26 ($40). For information, call Baz 
Hawley at (714) 380-2666. 
</P>
<P>
 What: Great American Adventure Run. 
</P>
<P>
 When: Saturday, Feb. 12, at 8 a.m. for the 2.8-mile run and at 8:30 a.m. for 
4.8-mile event (registration opens at 6:30 a.m.) 
</P>
<P>
 Where: Huntington Central Park, Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Whereabouts: From the San Diego (405) Freeway, exit at Warner Avenue and head 
east. Turn left on Edwards Street, and left again on Central Park Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 Wherewithal: $17 (includes T-shirt). 
</P>
<P>
 Where to call: (714) 841-5417.

KIDS ON FILM: DAD TAKES ROMANCE OUT OF 'HERO' I N "MY FATHER, THE HERO," A 
14-YEAR-OLD CITY GIRL GOES ON VACATION WITH HER DIVORCED DAD (GERARD 
DEPARDIEU), AND THEY BOTH BECOME ENTANGLED IN DECEIT WHEN SHE TRIES TO IMPRESS 
A RICH HUNK BY TELLING HIM HER FATHER IS HER SUGAR DADDY AND HE PLAYS ALONG.

<P>
 Can you say . . . "Oedipal"? How about . . . "incestuous"? 
</P>
<P>
 Well, then, try "gross."  
</P>
<P>
 For some pubescent girls, parts of this film might be a fun fantasy, I 
suppose. What girl today gets her dad all to herself for 10 minutes, much less 
10 days, not to mention on a white sand beach in the balmy Bahamas? And then 
finds the boy of her dreams, a guy who's handsome and rich and protective? And 
they fight over her? And she looks like a model and wears great clothes? 
</P>
<P>
 But still. When you base a sex comedy around a 14-year-old girl and her father 
lying about their relationship, there's bound to be a lot of psychological 
weirdness. And several kids questioned, as I did, the PG rating. They could 
just as easily have titled the film, "My Daughter, the Nymphet."  
</P>
<P>
 The girl, Nicole, has grown up on talk shows, she reads Cosmo, wears thong 
bathing suits and calls her mother "a bitch." Like most 14-year-olds, she 
considers her father only a notch above her mother, impossibly antiquated, and 
is embarrassed to share the planet with him. But at the same time, she yearns 
for his attention. 
</P>
<P>
 So she makes up this story, which causes the other guests to treat him like a 
child molester and provokes winks and nudges from the 17-year-old beach guys 
who figure she's easy. At 14.  
</P>
<P>
 The dad, from France, is the sort of guy who confides his own confused love 
life to people he doesn't know very well -- even if the person is 14 and his 
own daughter. At the same time, he is horrified at the prospect of his little 
baby growing up and dating.  
</P>
<P>
 When he finally accepts the inevitable, rather than keeping his distance, he 
joins her deception. 
</P>
<P>
 All the 12- to 14-year-old girls I talked to liked the movie, especially the 
romance with the boy, and thought the premise was funny. But they didn't seem 
to think he was much of a hero. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Jaylee Levine, 14, "It was a good movie, like the girl and the guy 
romance part. But not the child molest part. I didn't like that (the dad) went 
along with it. It was just, like, gross." 
</P>
<P>
 The movie's message could easily have been Shakespeare's: "Oh what a tangled 
web we weave/When first we practice to deceive." And maybe some got the point. 
</P>
<P>
 But the girls said they were too distracted by Depardieu (his Frenchness, his 
large, dimpled nose) and Dalton James who played cute guy Ben (his general 
hunkiness.)  
</P>
<P>
 Depardieu was the only good actor in the film, they thought. They called James 
an amateur, despite his good looks, and they unanimously thumbed down Nicole 
(Katherine Heigh) calling the character "a spoiled brat" and a "con artist." 
</P>
<P>
 Not many said they would want Dad's help in their own love lives. 
</P>
<P>
 "No. No. No," said Ashley Carlton, 14. "I would want him to stay out of my 
business."  
</P>
<P>
 "I wouldn't mind if my dad did that," Jennifer said. But she added: "A dad 
would never do that. . . . It's like one of those stories that would never 
happen in real life." 
</P>
<P>
 I'm glad. I got the disconcerting feeling that the filmmakers thought it was 
OK to portray a 14-year-old girl as a lust object. And that they thought the 
father really was a kind of hero. 
</P>
<P>
 They seemed to be going for the "Awww" ending when he says he wants to have 
more babies and hopes they're girls. But I'm sure there are others who would 
want to institute parenting licenses and then yank his.

SPECIAL SCREENING: 'BREATHLESS': RUNNING ON ADRENALINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK CHALON SMITH, Mark Chalon Smith is a free-lancer who regularly writes 
about film for the Times Orange County Edition.

<TEXT>
<P>
 The camera in "Breathless" jumps all over the place, as if director Jean-Luc 
Godard's cinematographer was hyperventilating, maybe breathless himself. 
</P>
<P>
 It was just one of the unconventional stylizations that freaked critics of the 
day. Many hated the 1960 movie, some calling it a lurid mess of technical 
ineptitude. Newsweek's headline over a meager review just said: "What Is It?" 
</P>
<P>
 Ah, the shortsighted views of the film establishment. 
</P>
<P>
 "Breathless" (screening Friday as part of UC Irvine's "Tragedy and Comedy" 
series) was reappraised in later years and has since become a milestone; it may 
be the most famous, if not the best, example of the French New Wave movement. 
</P>
<P>
 Moviegoers today may still be thrown off by its defiance of tradition. There 
is little of Hollywood's quest for seamlessness and lack of ambiguity in 
defining relationships and events. What there is, is Godard's compulsive vision 
of things, his desire to redefine filmmaking through often chaotic imagery. 
</P>
<P>
 The entire picture is driven by a strange adrenaline that seems counter to our 
customary expectations: The camera jerks about. The editing is erratic and 
choppy. The lighting is naturalistic, meaning uneven and blotchy, and the 
story, even with its dramatic push, moves, as one critic noted, "like an engine 
with a bad piston." 
</P>
<P>
 But "Breathless" elicits a perverse fascination, even when it feels too arty 
for its own good. Besides, the picture has Jean-Paul Belmondo in one of his 
most amusingly rude performances and, better still, Jean Seberg in the role 
that fixed her as the queen of the French cinema's anti-Establishment. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The film starts off like a goofy, insouciant road picture, with Belmondo as 
Michel, a petty hood driving a stolen car. While cruising, he talks directly to 
the camera about this and that, smugly showing he doesn't give a hoot about the 
reality ready to confront him. 
</P>
<P>
 When a couple of motorcycle cops chase him down, Michel kills one of them. He 
then spends the rest of the movie trying to raise money in several seedy 
Parisian quarters so he can get out of town, hopefully with his girlfriend, 
Patricia Franchini (Seberg), an American expatriate who sells Herald-Tribunes 
on the corner and wants to be a journalist. 
</P>
<P>
 There's a lot of wry talk (mostly by Belmondo) in Godard's screenplay (based 
on a story by Francois Truffaut) about the troubled relationship between men 
and women, and art and culture, mostly American. There's a windiness to it all 
these days, but the straightforward dialogue must have seemed intimate and 
revealing in the '60s. 
</P>
<P>
 Godard is revealing when Michel attempts to define himself through American 
archetypes and his desire for Patricia. Michel's allegiance to Bogart is a 
statement of his own contrived image of himself (Woody Allen used the same 
idolatry for comic relief in "Play It Again, Sam" in 1972), and his fascination 
with Patricia is, at least in part, rooted to his psychological separation from 
life in Paris. 
</P>
<P>
 Our fascination with Patricia is very different, of course. She's the street 
waif with sex appeal, even under the handicap of a severe Joan of Arc hairdo. 
When she blithely checks herself out in a storefront mirror, she fairly beams 
with freshness.

RESTAURANTS: DARING FARE STANDS UP AT FIVE FEET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAX JACOBSON, Max Jacobson is a free-lance writer who reviews restaurants 
weekly for The Times Orange County Edition. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A little more than a decade ago, a few daring chefs had the radical idea of 
combining European and Asian techniques and ingredients. Critics, by and large, 
were awe-struck. Today, the daring idea has become a widespread movement, but 
Five Feet continues to surprise us. 
</P>
<P>
 When chef Michael Kang first opened this drafty-looking, art-filled restaurant 
in Laguna Beach, there were inevitable comparisons to a restaurant called 
Chinois on Main in Santa Monica, where Wolfgang Puck was making big waves 
redefining Euro-Asian cooking. I've never understood the comparison. While both 
restaurants do a lot of Euro-Asian experimentation, I've regarded Chinois from 
the start as a hybrid that includes not only Chinese but Japanese, French and 
California cuisines in the mix. 
</P>
<P>
 Five Feet is a different story. This place started life firmly rooted in 
China, then metamorphosed into a restaurant influenced by New Mexico, Italy, 
Hawaii and even Louisiana. 
</P>
<P>
 The place comes by its pedigree honestly. Chef/owner Michael Kang is Chinese 
American, meaning pot stickers and kung pao chicken are as much a part of his 
cooking as his Delmonico steak and salmon carpaccio. Over time, Kang has 
developed a playful, original cooking style. Where else do you get hot lemon 
potato chips with your vegetable soup, or a combination such as lamb with 
spiced tofu and balsamic vinegar? 
</P>
<P>
 The restaurant has matured in other ways during the past few years. The snappy 
service, once arrogant, is now both informed and efficient, and the kitchen is 
faster than I remember. One more plus is the wine list, which is patrician in 
the extreme, rich with top-drawer French and California wines. Heady stuff if 
money is no object. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The ambience hasn't much budged, though. It's still what I'd call terminally 
hip, Laguna's homage to minimalism. With its bare cement walls, exposed ceiling 
ducts, vents and jutting shapes of corrugated metal, Five Feet looks more like 
an industrial loft space somewhere in East L.A. than a South County dining 
room. A pencil sketch of a frantic crowd scene covers up one of the walls; 
other spaces showcase the avant-garde works of local artists. 
</P>
<P>
 Five Feet's gallery look is probably a major reason for the restaurant's 
distinctive clientele, in large part artists, eccentrics and stylish office 
types. You see more of the last category on Fridays, the one day of the week 
the restaurant opens for lunch. I mention this because lunch is a bargain. 
</P>
<P>
 The menu changes daily, but you can always count on finding Mama Kang's pot 
stickers, which are simply the best pot stickers I've tasted: golden brown on 
all sides, filled with a dense, juicy meat stuffing and a served with a 
delicate, even ethereal, soy-ginger dipping sauce. 
</P>
<P>
 The crisp-skinned goat cheese won tons are another treat that's always around, 
and you might get lucky and find goat-cheese-stuffed zucchini blossoms on the 
menu. These lightly fried little purses of complex flavors have the same 
filling as the won tons -- goat cheese and chopped walnuts -- but they're 
particularly irresistible.  
</P>
<P>
 The salads are creative, too. One combines blackened Hawaiian ahi sashimi, 
mesclun greens and an oddly contrasting papaya-mint vinaigrette. Another 
features baby spinach, lobster gyoza (Japanese pot stickers) and a dry mustard 
vinaigrette. 
</P>
<P>
 Entrees tend to be a touch lighter at lunch. Grab duet of salmon if you see 
it. It's a pretty plate lined with king salmon carpaccio on which rests a 
sauteed medallion of peppered salmon garnished with sesame-toasted figs in warm 
lemon tarragon vinaigrette. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the New Zealand lamb rack, its sauce may be over-reduced, but with its 
complement of braised spinach and a galette-like potato pancake, this is a 
terrific plate of food for $13.50. 
</P>
<P>
 If there is one problem with this kitchen, it is a tendency to complicate. New 
Zealand John Dory can be a thing of beauty even without a chili-Parmesan crust, 
a bed of ratatouille vegetables, some rubbery fried gnocchi and a spicy lobster 
jus . And who among us really wants to brave Hawaiian ahi wrapped in nori 
seaweed with crab meat, avocado, wasabi , Asian mango papaya chow chow, crazy 
ponzu sauce and Chinese spaghetti?  
</P>
<P>
 Basics are best. Salt-and-pepper popcorn of rock shrimp and scallops, a fiery 
Cajun recipe right off the bayou, makes a terrific first course. 
</P>
<P>
 The elegant "golden cup" is eaten in the hollow of lettuce leaves smeared with 
plum sauce, a mixture of chicken, pine nuts, fried rice noodles and finely 
minced Chinese vegetables. 
</P>
<P>
 And Five Feet plays it straight with its fresh mussel and clam appetizer. The 
seafood is wok-seared in a spicy, unctuous black bean sauce, identical to what 
you'd get in any big-city Chinatown. 
</P>
<P>
 Meat eaters might want to sample the fine prime New York steak, gussied up 
with a wild mushroom sauce and served with meaty grilled portobello mushrooms. 
Fresh fish, such as mahi-mahi, halibut or that infamous ahi, comes in various 
globe-spanning incarnations. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 One evening, mahi-mahi was cooked in a three-pepper (serrano, New Mexico and 
chipotle) chili sauce, a Southwestern sort of dish more appropriate to Kachina 
across the street. Another evening the waiter suggested halibut in a macadamia 
crust with a pineapple-litchi sauce. You never know what to expect in this 
place. 
</P>
<P>
 Except at dessert, when you know not to expect anything earth-shattering. This 
is the most mundane feature of Five Feet. The best among them is probably a 
homemade peanut butter ice cream pie, with the coarse creme brulee lagging 
behind.  
</P>
<P>
 But I actually like to order the brulee , simply to watch the waiter finishing 
off the top with a real live blowtorch. Everybody's an artist in this town, I 
swear. 
</P>
<P>
 Five Feet is expensive. Starters are $4.95 to $9.50. Entrees are $13.95 to 
$23.95.

PARKER'S PLACE

<P>
 Well, There's Always Next Season -- Maybe 
</P>
<P>
 The last day of the quail hunting season came and went at the end of the 
month, a passage duly noted by the handful of Orange Countians still interested 
in upland game hunting, and, of course, by their bird dogs. 
</P>
<P>
 My brother and I loaded up the truck, Cassius the one-eyed Labrador blundered 
into the back seat, and off we took for quail country, a two-hour drive from 
Laguna. The sky was a little cloudy at sunup, in apparent contradiction to the 
weatherman's prediction of strong Santa Ana winds all day. We were pleased by 
this, because the birds are extra hard to find on a windy day; dogs have a 
tough time smelling them, and if you are lucky enough to come across a covey 
they much prefer to run away -- invisibly scurrying through the brush -- rather 
than take to the perilous sky. 
</P>
<P>
 At the end of a season, be it skiing, football, autumn or holiday, the 
enthusiast feels an odd serenity creeping in, a sense of closure, and certainly 
loss. Time's big season-hand is just about to cross the 12 again. There you 
are, faced with one last opportunity to get it right, maybe to atone for all 
the mistakes you've made until now, braid the loose strings of a few month's 
time together in a rope that secures something of history, accomplishment, or 
at least enjoyment. 
</P>
<P>
 There's also that nagging reminder that you won't necessarily -- for reasons 
often quite outside your direct control -- be here by the beginning of next 
season to begin it all again. "It would be a shame for me to miss this," you 
think. You try not to get going too fast in this direction, lest true 
melancholy set in. It's poor form to get prematurely elegiac. 
</P>
<P>
 But, heading out toward the hunting grounds, I watched the familiar landmarks 
passing outside the windshield -- the fruit stand just south of Temecula, the 
big oak at the bend of Highway 79 a few miles past it, the pastures already 
emerald with new grass for the thoroughbreds, the cattle standing fatly by the 
roadside and viewing me back with profound disinterest -- and hoped more than a 
little to be making this same drive Oct. 15, when the season opens. I vowed to 
avoid personal tragedy until then, a resolution that, by the definition of 
tragedy, rarely works. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time we got to our first of three huntable areas -- secret spots 
revealed to me by a man who has known me longer than I've known myself (he and 
his wife baby-sat me as an infant) -- the wind was strong and our hopes for a 
good day were blowing away in it. The air was cold enough to sting your hands 
and face. We surveyed the land with the speculative air of economists, 
prognosticating where, logically, the birds might be. 
</P>
<P>
 But wild things tend to ignore logic in favor of survival, which is why they 
are still alive, so we simply set off up the hillside, bound for the gentle, 
cactus-heavy meadows where the birds will sometimes feed. These first few 
hundred yards, so rich with the possibility of finding birds, always go by as a 
kind of slow-motion, adrenalin-charged satori in which the potential of the 
hunt is as vast as the country around you, and as close as the cholla spines 
brushing past your ankles. 
</P>
<P>
 Anything can happen. 
</P>
<P>
 By this time we reached the top of the first ridge. Puffing hard, breaking 
sweat, birdless, it began to dawn on us that this in fact might turn out to be 
one very long day. We stopped. Cassius, hellbent as usual on getting a bird in 
his mouth, looked hopefully at me for guidance. Poor dog. It was a 
high-road/low-road decision. In the spirit of democracy we took a middle 
course, with Cassius weaving out ahead of us and pausing only occasionally to 
choke down huge mouthfuls of snow and look back at us with his one great 
beautiful eye. 
</P>
<P>
 We were fast marking the end of Cassius' fourth full season, a time during 
which he had retrieved enough birds to qualify, in the eyes of purists, as a 
"bird dog." He has made some fine improvements over these years, learning to 
work in closer, obey hand signals, use his nose instead of his legs to locate 
his quarry. A few weeks earlier, he had located a downed bird caught eight feet 
up in a manzanita tree (in a high wind, no less!), a feat of which I will be 
eternally proud and he has probably already forgotten. 
</P>
<P>
 But he has also developed a kind of schizophrenia, during bouts of which he 
will disappear for minutes at a time to flush birds from impossibly dense 
cover, ignore the whistle, disdain hand signals and generally make an obnoxious 
dolt of himself. I've noticed that these relapses often coincide with poor 
outdoorsmanship on my own part -- taking bad shots, not taking good ones, 
working a covey stupidly, watching the sky fill with escaping birds while 
urinating behind a bush. There is much room for improvement in both of us. 
</P>
<P>
 We hiked for two hours and didn't so much as hear a quail. The wind blasted us 
into near deafness, which may have had something to do with it. At this point, 
the mind inevitably begins to wander, an altogether pleasant experience. 
</P>
<P>
 I looked out to the distant mountains and nearer hills, noted encroachment of 
homes and trailers, and realized that by the end of the decade we probably 
won't be able to hunt this land any more. 
</P>
<P>
 So be it. 
</P>
<P>
 I thought about our County of Orange, so plagued of late by violence, 
catastrophe and confusion. Can consumerism evolve into citizenship? When?  
</P>
<P>
 At 40, you suddenly realize that many of the Earth's people are younger than 
you are, and how much better they are at doing what you like to do. I thought 
about watching the boys' tennis class on Monday nights at the high school, the 
easy grace, skill and joy they bring to the game. I thought about shooting a 
round of skeet recently with a young girl who scored a perfect 25, and smiled 
at me through her braces as she walked off the range and said, "I'm not new to 
this." I thought about this other girl I saw riding a horse a few days back, 
this plump cherub a study in natural harmony upon a 2,000-pound animal. It's 
immensely reassuring to know that lots of young people are already more 
accomplished than you'll ever be. It has nothing to do with hope, or with the 
future. They are reality; they are here. 
</P>
<P>
 We returned to the truck for food and water. The wind was stronger now, 
shivering the stout cactus and raising dirt devils on the road. We drove a few 
minutes to a new spot and commenced our march across the meadow. 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, the season was ending, right before our squinting eyes. For reasons 
not clear, I thought back to the night before when I'd sat in bed and listened 
to the wind chimes my sister gave me when my wife died, and remembered the note 
she'd given me with the chimes, something to the effect that "when you hear 
these moving in a breeze, know it's Cat come back for a visit," and sure 
enough, that night the chimes sounded and the patio door eased open, then shut 
again, as if someone had just come in, and though I do not believe in ghosts or 
in visitations by the dead, I will admit that a calm and a contentment came 
over me for a while after that and these were not feelings I had had in a long 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 At the end of a season, memories hit hard. 
</P>
<P>
 Rounding a dense stand of manzanita, I heard in the distance the telltale whir 
of bird wings, and saw two quail lifting fast from the scrub. They were out of 
range for a person of my skill. But I shot anyway, two times, what might be 
called "prayers," and prayers is just what they were, gestures directed toward 
the infinite. The birds swept up and away and safely over the rise. 
</P>
<P>
 Heading back to the truck a few minutes later I hoped that those birds would 
be here next year, and that I would, too. Given the grand scheme of things, 
neither is guaranteed nor crucial. 
</P>
<P>
 The only thing I was sure of is that the end of one season enables the 
beginning of the next.

 It had been nearly a month since Robb Stauber started in goal. 
</P>
<P>
 It had been more than a month since Charlie Huddy had scored a goal. 
</P>
<P>
 It seemed like a month since the Kings had won a game. 
</P>
<P>
 But all that came to an end Wednesday night at the Forum where the Kings, 
sparked by Stauber in the net and the offense of their defensemen, beat the 
Chicago Blackhawks, 4-2, before a sellout crowd of 16,005. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory broke a three-game losing streak for the Kings and a slump in 
which they were 1-6-2 in their previous nine games. 
</P>
<P>
 But even in victory, the Kings, now 20-27-6, figure to be facing a loss. With 
4:57 remaining to play, Tony Granato was assessed a match penalty for cracking 
his stick over the helmet of Chicago defenseman Neil Wilkinson. It was ruled a 
deliberate attempt to injure. 
</P>
<P>
 Granato and Wilkinson collided along the boards, Granato going down. Wilkinson 
stood over the King wing and appeared to taunt him. 
</P>
<P>
 Granato quickly got to his feet and smashed his stick over Wilkinson's helmet, 
using both hands. 
</P>
<P>
 It was four-on-four for two minutes, leaving the Blackhawks with a man 
advantage for 2:57. 
</P>
<P>
 But they couldn't take advantage, despite getting off seven shots after the 
penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 Stauber hadn't started a game since Jan. 15 and hadn't started a game on Forum 
ice all season. 
</P>
<P>
 But he got his chance when Coach Barry Melrose decided to give Kelly Hrudey a 
rest after nine consecutive starts. 
</P>
<P>
 And Stauber made the most of it, improving his record to 3-4-1. 
</P>
<P>
 The inactivity didn't appear to affect Stauber. And it was just as well for 
his sake. 
</P>
<P>
 The Blackhawks came out firing, outshooting the Kings, 12-7, in the first 
period, 17-4 in the second and 51-23 for the game. 
</P>
<P>
 No problem. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kings actually seem to thrive on such adversity. They are now 3-0-2 in 
games in which they give up 50 or more shots. 
</P>
<P>
 Stauber faced 55 shots in a game earlier this season at Detroit, but the game 
wound up a 4-4 tie. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago (25-23-6) got the first goal Wednesday, Dirk Graham scoring his 12th. 
</P>
<P>
 But Jari Kurri's 22nd goal tied the score and Huddy's third of the season put 
the Kings ahead for good. It was Huddy's first goal since New Year's Eve. 
</P>
<P>
 Blake's two third-period goals, his 14th and 15 of the season, gave the Kings 
their winning margin. 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Murphy made it closer with his 20th. 
</P>
<P>
 But, despite Granato's damaging blow, Chicago got no closer. 
</P>
<P>
 King Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Blackhawk defenseman Chris Chelios sat out, missing the fourth and final game 
of his suspension for gouging the eye of the Vancouver Canucks' Dana Murzyn. . 
. . Defenseman Mark Hardy, who has spent 11 of his 15 professional seasons in 
the Kings' organization, has been named assistant coach of the Phoenix 
Roadrunners, the Kings' minor league club, under Coach Rick Dudley. Hardy, who 
has appeared in 25 games for the Roadrunners this season, will continue to play 
despite taking on his new duties. Hardy, 35, is the Kings' all-time leading 
scorer among defensemen with 303 points.

LAKERS DEFEAT JAZZ AGAIN TO CREEP UP IN STANDINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HOWARD-COOPER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Lakers blew it again Wednesday night, apparently unaware this is a time 
they are supposed to be going in the tank, apparently unaware they are supposed 
to be on track for one of the worst records in the NBA to secure a top lottery 
pick. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest foul-up came at the Delta Center, where the Lakers, three nights 
after beating Utah at the Forum and one night after knocking off Phoenix for 
the third time, dumped the Jazz again, 103-96, behind 25 points from Sedale 
Threatt. Many more mistakes like this and they'll be legitimately in the 
playoff hunt. 
</P>
<P>
 Say what? 
</P>
<P>
 That's getting ahead of themselves, but the Lakers have already passed the 
Clippers in the standings, have won four in a row to tie the longest run of the 
season, seven out of 10, and are heading into what should be their most 
favorable stretch of schedule. Included in the next 15 outings are two games 
each against last-place Sacramento and Washington, two against Boston and one 
each against Philadelphia, Milwaukee, Dallas, Minnesota and the Clippers. 
</P>
<P>
 The Denver Nuggets are four games in the distance for the eighth and final 
playoff spot, still breathing room under any circumstances and especially since 
the new pursuer has also lost twice to the Kings and once to the Timberwolves 
and 76ers. But imagine even bringing up the conversation, say, back on, Jan. 
20, when the Lakers were 11-25 and had just learned they would be without 
Anthony Peeler, Doug Christie and Sam Bowie. 
</P>
<P>
 "The schedule," Coach Randy Pfund said. "Dallas, Indiana, Detroit. That's what 
got us started. We got three teams who were in a similar situation as us. The 
last few games, we have taken a step up in class." 
</P>
<P>
 That included Wednesday, another new test because the Lakers (18-28) needed to 
beat the Jazz (31-18) on the road on the second night of a back-to-back and 
while playing for the fifth time in seven days. Fatigue was a possibility, but 
so was fate. 
</P>
<P>
 So the Lakers simply grabbed a quick lead and went up by as many as eight 
points early in the first quarter. The advantage was seven at halftime, 49-42, 
before they shot 61.1% in the third quarter and led by 11. 
</P>
<P>
 The problems came in the fourth quarter. Actually, the problem: Karl Malone. 
</P>
<P>
 Working inside and hitting soft jumpers from the perimeter, he scored nine 
consecutive points, stepped aside for a Jay Humphries basket, then scored four 
more points, and Utah was within 89-88. 
</P>
<P>
 When Felton Spencer dunked with 2:20 remaining, the Jazz took the lead for the 
first time since early in the second quarter. That lasted all of 17 seconds, or 
until Threatt went to work. The player who scored 26 points in Tuesday's Forum 
victory over Phoenix, he made two consecutive jumpers, then beat Humphries on a 
drive to the basket. 
</P>
<P>
 That put the Lakers back up, 97-93, with 53 seconds to go and, after the Jazz 
missed on the ensuing possession, Utah had to begin fouling. The Lakers held up 
at the line, too, converting all six attempts the last 41 seconds. Threatt had 
two of those to give him nine points in the fourth quarter, after going for 13 
in the final period the night before. 
</P>
<P>
 "(John) Stockton one night and KJ (Kevin Johnson) the next," Threatt said. 
"But right now I'm shooting the ball well." 
</P>
<P>
 The big-name counterparts are falling for Threatt and the Lakers. The Jazz one 
night, the Suns the next. Then the Jazz again. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first half of the season, we were afraid of everybody," Vlade Divac said 
after getting 18 points and nine rebounds to continue his impressive run. 
"Dallas, we would be afraid of. Now, we come here and we believe we can win. 
Utah, Houston, San Antonio, New York. It doesn't matter. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't have a leader, don't have a big-name player on our team, an 
all-star. So confidence is very important for us." 
</P>
<P>
 The wins help, too.

NBA ROUNDUP; PAYTON, KEMP SHOW WHY THEY ARE ALL-STARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Seattle's two NBA All-Stars, one named only a few hours before the game, made 
sure the SuperSonics would enter the break with the league's best record. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Payton, named to the Western Conference team on Wednesday to replace 
injured Charles Barkley, scored 19 points and had nine assists in three 
quarters to lead the SuperSonics to a 115-94 victory over Portland at Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
 Shawn Kemp, the SuperSonics' other All-Star, pulled down a season-high 19 
rebounds and added 15 points as Seattle won its fourth in a row to improve its 
record to 35-10 in its final start before Sunday's All-Star game. 
</P>
<P>
 Kemp said he was delighted that Payton is going to Minneapolis with him. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's well deserved with the year he's had," Kemp said. "It can't get any 
better than having your coach (George Karl) and your point guard with you at 
the All-Star game." 
</P>
<P>
 Phoenix 111, Minnesota 106 -- Cedric Ceballos and Kevin Johnson each scored 24 
points for the Suns at Phoenix. The Suns are 18-0 against the Timberwolves. 
</P>
<P>
 The Suns' Oliver Miller recorded his first triple-double: 14 points, 15 
rebounds and 11 assists. 
</P>
<P>
 New Jersey 106, Cleveland 95 -- Kenny Anderson scored 24 points and the Nets 
took advantage of Cleveland's front-line absentees at East Rutherford, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
 New Jersey snapped a two-game losing streak, while the Cavaliers struggled 
without center Brad Daugherty (flu) and forward Larry Nance (sore knee). 
</P>
<P>
 Detroit 102, Boston 95 -- Isiah Thomas scored 28 points -- 19 of them in an 
otherwise cold-shooting first half -- as the Pistons broke a three-game losing 
streak and won at Boston. 
</P>
<P>
 New York 114, Philadelphia 79 -- Patrick Ewing had 18 points and 11 rebounds 
and Charles Oakley had 13 points and 12 rebounds for the Knicks at 
Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
 Golden State 126, Charlotte 116 -- Latrell Sprewell scored a season-high 34 
points to lead five players in double figures as the Warriors won at Charlotte, 
dealing the Hornets their eighth consecutive loss. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hornets got a team record-tying 41 points from Hersey Hawkins. 
</P>
<P>
 Orlando 104, Atlanta 87 -- Shaquille O'Neal scored 37 points and Dennis Scott 
had 24 for the Magic at Orlando. 
</P>
<P>
 Indiana 102, Miami 98 -- Reserve forward Ken Williams scored a career-high 25 
points and Derrick McKey had a season-high 30 to lift the Pacers at Miami. 
</P>
<P>
 The loss was the 700th of Kevin Loughery's 19-year coaching career.

CLIPPERS SHOOT THEMSELVES IN FOOT AGAIN; PRO BASKETBALL: SPENCER LEAVES GAME 
WITH INJURY, BUT L.A. BLOWS CHANCES IN 105-95 LOSS AT SACRAMENTO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 First, the Clippers lost starting center Elmore Spencer because of a bruised 
left thigh. 
</P>
<P>
 Then they lost their second consecutive game, this time to the Sacramento 
Kings, 105-95, Wednesday night at Arco Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 Spencer, who scored a career-high 19 points in the Clippers' 122-110 win over 
the Kings last Saturday at the Sports Arena, left with 7:52 remaining in the 
second quarter after being kneed by Lionel Simmons in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 "Without Elmore we really couldn't play their post-up people straight up," 
Clipper Coach Bob Weiss said. "And when we were double teaming they were taking 
advantage of it by shooting the ball well outside." 
</P>
<P>
 All-Star guard Mitch Richmond, who sat out the Kings 124-100 loss to Portland 
on Tuesday night with back spasms, scored 35 points, 23 in the second half, as 
the Kings (14-32) beat the Clippers (16-29) for the first time in three games 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just had bad timing on his back spasms," Weiss said. "He was terrific 
tonight." 
</P>
<P>
 Clipper forward Danny Manning, who scored only four points in the second half 
of Tuesday night's 118-89 loss to the Chicago Bulls, had 23 points against the 
Kings, but scored only four points in the second half, making two of six shots. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is how we've been playing of late," Manning said. "We're not doing the 
things to get us over the hump." 
</P>
<P>
 Guard Mark Jackson, who failed to score in the second half against the Bulls, 
scored only two points in the final three quarters against the Kings, making 
only one of seven shots. 
</P>
<P>
 However guards Ron Harper and Gary Grant kept the Clippers close. Harper 
scored 16 of his team-high 26 points in the second half and Grant, who scored a 
season-high 22 points, had 18 in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no consolation in keeping it close," Harper said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers, who lead the NBA in turnovers, had 18, which the Kings converted 
into 31 points. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the same old story," Weiss said. "We shoot ourselves in the foot more 
than we get beat." 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers, who trailed, 86-83, early in the fourth quarter, were outscored, 
19-12, in the final 7 1/2 minutes of the game as the Kings ended a three-game 
losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
 Richmond scored 16 points in the third quarter as the Kings outscored the 
Clippers, 25-19, in the quarter to take an 80-72 lead into the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers, who shot only 29.3% in the second half of Tuesday night's loss 
to the Bulls, shot 31.8% in the third quarter against the Kings. 
</P>
<P>
 Richmond jump started the Kings in the second half, scoring seven points as 
they opened the third quarter with an 11-3 spurt. 
</P>
<P>
 Weiss, whose team had lost three of its last four games, made a lineup change, 
starting forward John Williams in place of rookie Harold Ellis, who had 
averaged 10.9 points, 3.7 rebounds and 2.33 steals in 15 games. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams, who was suspended for the first 42 games of the season while he was 
at a weight-management clinic at Duke, played his third game of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams finished with four points, four assists, two steals and a team-high 
eight rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Clipper Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant coach Dave Wohl screamed at several players in the locker room after 
the game for having a lax attitude. Wohl scolded the players by saying that 
they were laughing as if they had won. Wohl declined comment. . . . King guard 
Mitch Richmond, who made two of three three-point shots, became the all-time 
franchise leader in three-pointers with 210.

ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Jose Mota would like to say a word or two on behalf of the minor leaguers of 
this nation. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's totally unfair that Michael Jordan is going to spring training 
with a triple-A contract," Mota said. "There are guys who have been playing pro 
ball for years who never get to triple-A. He hasn't played since high school, 
but he's liable to take away a paycheck from someone who is more deserving and 
has paid his dues." . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Mota, 28, is one of four sons of Dodger Coach Manny Mota in professional 
baseball. He began his career in 1985 and had a cup of instant coffee with the 
San Diego Padres in 1991. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 It might prove to be embarrassing for Jordan if he is given a spot on the 
Nashville Sounds' roster because of his drawing power rather than his batting 
power. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be awfully tough for him," Mota said. "He's going to see balls 
coming at him at 85 or 90 m.p.h. He's going to face pitchers who know how to 
cut a ball and sink it. It's a lot different than batting practice." . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Mota might get a closeup view of Jordan's quest. He is an infielder in the 
Kansas City Royals' organization and is expected to open the season for Omaha, 
a Nashville rival in the American Assn. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Mota has a bachelor's degree in communications from Cal State Fullerton and 
would like to become a sportscaster. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 There is a better chance that Jordan will be playing in the NBA than in the 
American League when Mota starts work behind a microphone. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 For those who say baseball is lacking big names, what about Jordan, Bo Jackson 
and Deion Sanders? . . . 
</P>
<P>
 There is no truth to the rumor that the Dodgers are interested in trading for 
Joe Magrane. . . . 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 What is your favorite late-night show -- David Letterman, Jay Leno, Arsenio 
Hall or UCLA basketball? The Bruins were supposed to get some prime-time 
exposure tonight, but their game against Washington at Pauley Pavilion will be 
shown tape-delayed at 11 p.m. on Prime Ticket after the Laker-Sacramento King 
game that was rescheduled because of the earthquake. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Harrick would like to see one carryover from the loss at Notre Dame -- 
improved free-throw shooting. The Bruins are only 65.5% for the season, but 
shot 85.2% (23 of 27) Saturday. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 George Raveling and Kelvin Sampson will be opponents when USC plays Washington 
State tonight at the Sports Arena. This summer, Raveling will be the coach of 
the U.S. team in the Goodwill Games at St. Petersburg, Russia, and Sampson will 
be an assistant. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Charlie Ward is expected to join Dave Winfield as the only athletes to be 
drafted in three sports -- football, basketball and baseball. Ward was selected 
in the 59th round last year by the Milwaukee Brewers. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, Winfield was drafted by four teams -- the Utah Stars of the old 
American Basketball Assn., the Atlanta Hawks, the San Diego Padres and the 
Minnesota Vikings. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Perennial volleyball powers UCLA and Pepperdine will play in the 17th annual 
Kilgour Cup Friday night at Pauley Pavilion. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Horses aren't the only ones who run at Santa Anita. Laffit Pincay, 47, jogs 
around the one-mile track most mornings. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 That was a nasty cut former heavyweight champion Riddick Bowe suffered in 
training last month. He has resumed road work, but won't be able to spar for a 
few more weeks. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The Hockey News rates Mighty Duck first choice Paul Kariya behind only Peter 
Forsberg among those NHL draftees who are playing outside the league. Kariya 
will play for Canada, and Forsberg, who is property of the Quebec Nordiques, 
for Sweden in the Winter Olympics. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Kadar Hamilton, a defensive back from Loyola High and son of Raider defensive 
line coach Ray Hamilton, has been awarded a football scholarship by Stanford. . 
. . 
</P>
<P>
 Attention NFL draftniks: Your big days are April 24-25. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 As expected, Ray Rhodes returned to the San Francisco 49ers after spending the 
last two seasons as the Green Bay Packer defensive coordinator. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Most active NFL team in the free-agent market probably will be the New England 
Patriots, who are $20 million under the salary cap. They have new ownership, 
and Bill Parcells is eager to build a winner. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Kite is the defending champion and all-time leading money-winner, and Fred 
Couples has won two of the last four L.A. Opens, but look for Jack Nicklaus to 
attract the biggest gallery today at Riviera.

COLLEGE BASKETBALL ROUNDUP; ARKANSAS ENDS KENTUCKY WINNING STREAK, 90-82 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press

<P>
 Arkansas played bookends to a Kentucky winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
 When Wednesday's game began, the third-ranked Razorbacks had been the last 
visitor to win at Rupp Arena in Lexington, Ky., on Jan. 25, 1992. When it 
ended, Arkansas, 17-2 and 7-2 in the Southeastern Conference, had closed the 
winning streak at 33, defeating the fourth-ranked Wildcats, 90-82. 
</P>
<P>
 Scotty Thurman finished with 26 points and Corliss Williamson added 21 for 
Arkansas in a game that had Kentucky Coach Rick Pitino both hospitable and ill. 
</P>
<P>
 "My congratulations go to Arkansas," Pitino said. "They've done this to us 
twice in a row. They've been the superior basketball team twice in a row." 
</P>
<P>
 But "it's such a farce," he said of his team's performance. "I feel like 
throwing up." 
</P>
<P>
 A 19-3 run by the Razorbacks midway through the second half put them in front 
for good, though their lead was often tenuous. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 6 Connecticut 94, Boston College 91 -- Donyell Marshall scored 33 points, 
including the last four points of the second overtime for the Huskies (20-2, 
10-1) in a Big East game at Newton, Mass. Boston College (16-7, 7-5) pulled 
within 91-90, but Marshall hit a basket 20 seconds later to clinch the game. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 10 Purdue 98, Northwestern 81 -- It took Glenn Robinson less than nine 
minutes to reach his 44th consecutive double-figure scoring game, and he had 22 
points in the first half to spark the Boilermakers (19-3, 7-3) past 
Northwestern (9-9, 0-9) in a Big Ten game at West Lafayette, Ind. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 15 Missouri 82, Colorado 70 -- Melvin Booker and Kelly Thames cooled off 
the Buffaloes (10-10, 2-6) in the second half with two free throws and a 
three-pointer, and freshman Kelly Thames scored 20 points to lead the Tigers 
(17-2, 8-0) in a Big Eight game at Columbia, Mo.

 Swingman Jason Miele scored 12 of his 15 points in the fourth quarter and 
forward Erik Jackley had a team-high 16 points in Valencia's 63-52 Orange 
League victory over host Savanna Wednesday, which kept Valencia in contention 
for the league title. 
</P>
<P>
 Valencia improved to 13-10, 7-2 in league play.The Tigers trail league-leading 
Magnolia (18-6, 8-1) by one game. The teams meet in a season finale Friday 
night at Valencia. 
</P>
<P>
 Magnolia defeated Valencia, 54-49, on Jan. 21. Tiger first-year Coach Dean 
Yoshimura said his team faces a difficult task Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We might have to play a perfect game against them," Yoshimura said. "But no 
matter what happens, we're very happy to be in this position. 
</P>
<P>
 "We thought we had a chance to be in this position from the beginning of the 
season and this is all I could have asked for." 
</P>
<P>
 Magnolia, Savanna and Valencia have clinched the league's three automatic 
playoff berths. Valencia swept the season series with Savanna (12-11, 6-3). The 
Tigers also defeated the Rebels, 66-59, Jan. 19. 
</P>
<P>
 Miele sparked the Tigers Friday by making eight of 10 free throws in the 
fourth quarter when Valencia outscored Savanna, 22-16. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not a great free-throw shooter, but they kept going down tonight," said 
Miele, who made 10 of 14 free throws in the game. "I knew (Savanna) had to foul 
us in the fourth quarter to try and catch up so I kept trying to get the ball." 
</P>
<P>
 Three Savanna players fouled out. Valencia went ahead by 12 three times in the 
fourth quarter as Savanna had problems scoring against the zone defense. 
</P>
<P>
 Valencia led, 28-25, at halftime and, 41-36, after three quarters. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rebels were led by guard Jermaine Moore with 18 points. Forward Todd 
Wilson added 10 points and 10 rebounds. JASON H. REID

SUNSET LEAGUE BOYS' SOCCER; SANTA ANA PROVES EARLY SLUMP IS OVER WITH SHUTOUT 
OF EDISON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE McKIBBEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It took Santa Ana nearly the entire boys' soccer season to do it, but the 
Saints are finally starting to live up to their preseason billing. 
</P>
<P>
 With their 2-0 victory Wednesday over host Edison, the fifth-ranked Saints 
have clinched at least a share of the Sunset League title. Suddenly, they have 
an outside shot to be the top-seeded team in the Southern Section Division I 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 A victory or tie Friday against Fountain Valley will give Santa Ana the league 
title outright over Marina, which is 10-2-1 in league. 
</P>
<P>
 "We slumped in the preseason, but I'd like to think we're peaking now, if you 
can ever be peaking in soccer," Santa Ana Coach Bob Pacieznik said. "We're just 
on a roll and I hope we can keep it going heading into CIF." 
</P>
<P>
 The Saints (14-4-2, 11-1-1) were ranked second in the preseason Orange County 
poll, but after two early losses they fell out of the top 10. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Santa Ana appears to headed back to the top with a bullet. It outshot 
Edison (16-5, 8-5), a team that appears to heading in the opposite direction, 
17-5, and scored once in each half. 
</P>
<P>
 Francisco Lagunas scored with four minutes left in the first half on a rebound 
of a Gerardo Velazquez shot. Santa Ana scored again on Velazquez's goal off an 
assist by Candido Lopez. Edison's only legitimate scoring chance came halfway 
through the second half when Jay Anderson's shot flew narrowly over the 
crossbar. 
</P>
<P>
 "Edison was under a lot of pressure," Pacieznik said. "They have to win to get 
in the playoffs." 
</P>
<P>
 However, Pacieznik realizes the pressure on his team will begin to increase in 
the next week. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been to the semifinals and lost the last two years," he said. "If I 
don't get past the semis this year, I think they're going to fire me. My 
brother keeps telling me he's going to start calling me Marty Schottenheimer 
(after the Kansas City Chiefs' coach) if I don't make it past the semifinals 
this year." 
</P>
<P>
 In other league games: 
</P>
<P>
 Fountain Valley 1, Ocean View 1 -- J.P. D'Brot scored in the second half to 
give Ocean View (4-15-3, 1-10-2) the tie with host Fountain Valley (5-9-6, 
3-5-4). 
</P>
<P>
 Westminster 3, Huntington Beach 2 -- Westminster rallied from 1-0 and 2-1 
deficits, despite being forced to play one man short for 70 minutes after Ismel 
Varela was given a red card for an intentional hand-ball. 
</P>
<P>
 Wayne Huelskamp scored his second goal with three minutes remaining to give 
Westminster (7-13, 4-9) its first lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Demetrio Ordaz scored twice for Huntington Beach (3-9-1 in league).

SUNSET LEAGUE BOYS' BASKETBALL; FOUNTAIN VALLEY WINS, CLINCHES SHARE OF TITLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL ITAGAKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fountain Valley Coach Gordon Billingsley had plenty to smile about after 
watching his team's 54-42 victory over Ocean View Wednesday at Fountain Valley 
High. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been a long time," Billingsley said. "This feels good." 
</P>
<P>
 Paced by the three players who have led them all season, the ninth-ranked 
Barons clinched a share of its first league title since the 1984-85 season. 
</P>
<P>
 Phil Domingo had 16 points and 15 rebounds, Brandon Leimbach had 15 points and 
10 rebounds and point guard Danny Hoppie had five points, nine rebounds, seven 
assists and five steals to lead Fountain Valley (19-5, 11-2 in league). 
</P>
<P>
 "Danny hasn't gotten as much recognition as Phil and Brandon, but he's been 
real important to us all year," Billingsley said. "He's our best ballhandler, 
and I leave him in there all the time. If he gets tired, I call time out." 
</P>
<P>
 Timeouts couldn't stop the Seahawks' slide. Ocean View (12-13, 7-6) lost its 
fourth consecutive game and has gone from challenging for the league title to 
fighting for a playoff spot. 
</P>
<P>
 During the losing streak, Ocean View Coach Jim Harris said, the Seahawks have 
struggled offensively, and one quarter of poor shooting did them in this time. 
</P>
<P>
 At halftime, Fountain Valley led, 29-23, before breaking open the game. Ocean 
View made only one of 13 shots from the field in the third quarter, scoring 
only two points as the Barons opened a 41-25 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Ocean View tried to rally behind Mike Carney, who had 17 points, including 
three three-pointers. But the Seahawks never drew closer than nine points. 
</P>
<P>
 Sophomore Nathan Strange came off the bench to score 10 points for Fountain 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Ocean View sophomore Marvin Marquez scored eight points, including two 
three-pointers in the second quarter, for Ocean View. 
</P>
<P>
 In other league games: 
</P>
<P>
 Huntington Beach 88, Westminster 56 -- Tony Gonzalez scored a career-high 43 
points, making 15 of 18 field-goal attempts, for 10th-ranked Huntington Beach 
(16-9, 10-3). Gia Tran scored 12 points for Westminster (5-18, 1-12). 
</P>
<P>
 Servite 69, Marina 54 -- Mark Seaton had 19 points and 11 rebounds and 
Kristian Vallas had 17 points for host Servite (17-7, 10-3). Eric Endsley had 
18 points for Marina (10-15, 4-9). 
</P>
<P>
 Edison 73, Santa Ana 42 -- Forward Micah Kroeger scored 19 points and guard 
Jason Sist added 12 for host Edison (14-8, 2-11). Randy Cruz and Cesar Diaz 
each scored 11 points for Santa Ana (3-17, 2-11).

EMPIRE LEAGUE BOYS' BASKETBALL; LOS ALAMITOS WINS TITLE ON ESPERANZA'S TURF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS FOSTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In Ryan Staniec's eyes, this was poetic justice. 
</P>
<P>
 He and the rest of the Los Alamitos seniors, got to pose for photographs 
moments after wrenching the Empire League title from Esperanza -- in the 
Aztecs' gym and in front of their fans. 
</P>
<P>
 Staniec's 20 points helped the Griffins survive a final burst for a 56-47 
victory. It gave them their fourth title in five seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 "It really hurts when someone comes to your house and rubs your nose in it," 
said Staniec, a 6-foot-7 forward. 
</P>
<P>
 He should know. A year ago, the Aztecs went to Los Alamitos to claim the 
league title. 
</P>
<P>
 That memory lingered. 
</P>
<P>
 "They did it to us at our place, now we got our revenge," Staniec said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Aztecs didn't give up easily. In fact, the Griffins couldn't do any 
serious celebrating until the final seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 With five seconds left, Los Alamitos Coach Steve Brooks began shouting, "It's 
over, it's over," sounding both happy and relieved. He had watched his team, 
ranked second in Orange County, nearly blow a nine-point lead in the final five 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Esperanza (16-8, 6-3) had lost to the Aztecs by 28 in the first meeting. But 
the Aztecs found themselves within four after Mike Thimgan heated up. 
</P>
<P>
 Thimgan, who had been held without a field goal through three quarters, scored 
10 of his 16 points in the final quarter. His two free throws made the score 
46-42 with 4:44 left. 
</P>
<P>
 Esperanza had two chances to get closer. But Josh Greer missed a short jumper, 
then Mike Lawson missed the front end of a one-and-one. 
</P>
<P>
 Staniec, who had been on the bench with four fouls, re-entered and scored the 
next four points. The Griffins (21-3, 9-0) made eight consecutive free throws 
down the stretch. 
</P>
<P>
 "We knew they were going to keep coming at us," Brooks said. We knew we 
couldn't let up." 
</P>
<P>
 Los Alamitos didn't, especially on defense. Not only did the Griffins hold 
Thimgan, the Aztecs' leading scorer, to two points in the first half, they held 
center Lawson scoreless. 
</P>
<P>
 In other league games: 
</P>
<P>
 Katella 75, Cypress 70 -- Katella (14-8, 5-4) clinched third place and the 
league's final playoff berth. Nick Roditis scored 25 points for the Knights, 
who made 24 of 29 foul shots. 
</P>
<P>
 El Dorado 72, Loara 59 -- Scott Davis had three three-pointers and 27 points 
for Loara (12-12, 2-7). Dante Spencer had 18 points to lead El Dorado (7-15, 
2-7).

</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>

and made the playoffs 13 times. 
</P>

in the league race, scored two goals in the second half, including Jose 
Monroy's eighth of the season.

PREP NOTES: MISSION VIEJO PROMOTES DENNY TO TAKE OVER FOOTBALL PROGRAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Bill Denny, hired Tuesday as Mission Viejo football coach, said he wants to 
put lessons learned from past Diablo coaches to good use in turning around the 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 "I sure hope to continue all the great traditions Mission Viejo has had over 
the years," said Denny, who had been an assistant to Diablo coaches Marty 
Spalding and Mike Rush. 
</P>
<P>
 Recent history hasn't been kind to Mission Viejo's program, however. Rush 
resigned under pressure after refusing to enforce a ban on the Diablo logo. He 
died of a heart attack last year at age 43. 
</P>
<P>
 Spalding and top assistant Bob Johnson, who coached sons Bret and Rob to 
Southern Section championships in the 1980s at El Toro, resigned after Mission 
Viejo posted a 4-6 record last season. 
</P>
<P>
 Denny, whose sons Bill and Matt were standouts at Mission Viejo, spent the 
last five seasons as a Mission Viejo assistant. He also spent three seasons 
under Estancia Coach John Liebengood. The Eagles were 0-10 in their first 
season under Liebengood and Denny but improved to 8-2 two years later. ELLIOTT

chest pains at school Tuesday, was released from Samaritan Medical Center-San 
Clemente Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Doctors are unsure what caused his pain but said McElroy, 33, did not suffer a 
heart attack, McElroy said from home Wednesday.He said his pain subsided late 
Tuesday, but doctors decided to have him stay overnight for observation and 
additional tests. 
</P>
<P>
 McElroy is taking medication and must return to the hospital Friday for more 
testing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been better," McElroy said. "Hopefully (the doctors) will have a better 
idea of what's going on (after Friday)." 
</P>
<P>
 McElroy, who began complaining of pain Tuesday morning, said he does not 
expect to resume his duties at San Clemente this week. JASON REID

CAL STATE FULLERTON NOTEBOOK / MIKE REILLEY: LIFE'S TAKEDOWNS JUST MAKE MAES 
STRONGER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE REILLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Five years of collegiate wrestling have taught Cal State Fullerton's Jeff Maes 
never to pin all his hopes on one match -- or one setback. 
</P>
<P>
 Put an obstacle in front of him, and he will politely take it down, then win 
on points. 
</P>
<P>
 Take the bum right knee that has troubled him since December. It has only made 
him tougher -- and more determined to reach the NCAA championships for a 
school-record fourth time. 
</P>
<P>
 "Actually, it has helped me as far as my intensity," said Maes, ranked eighth 
nationally in the 126-pound class by Amateur Wrestling News. 
</P>
<P>
 So has a change in his approach to the sport. 
</P>
<P>
 When the wrestling team's budget was cut two years ago because of decreased 
private donations, Maes had to pay his housing costs. 
</P>
<P>
 He could have quit, as some of his teammates did. Instead, he dug in his 
pockets, took out loans and landed a grant to pay for his expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 "Losing our budget made my love for the sport come back," Maes said. "I 
realized how important wrestling was to me. I thought back to when I was at (La 
Puente) Nogales High, when I wasn't wrestling for scholarship money but for 
myself. That's why I won a State title my senior year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now, I'm not wrestling for anything, no money. And I know if I'm not an 
All-American this year, at least I worked my butt off trying. This program is 
surviving, and we know that we're achieving something that other schools need 
money to achieve." 
</P>
<P>
 Maes is 23-4 this season, and how far he goes depends largely on how well his 
knee holds up. His only losses have come against higher-ranked wrestlers, and 
he is encouraged by the fact that he's undefeated since coming back from the 
knee injury. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jeff has put a lot of pressure on himself and is becoming more aggressive 
this season," Fullerton Coach Ardeshir Asgari said. "He's putting forth the 
effort it takes to win." 
</P>
<P>
 Maes stretched the medial collateral ligament in his right knee in December at 
a tournament in Las Vegas. He competed in Bakersfield a month later but 
re-injured it in an early-round match. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the injury, Maes kept competing -- and won the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that experience really helped me," he said. "Especially with my 
intensity. I wrestled four matches on a bum knee, and I did what I had to to 
win." 
</P>
<P>
 Maes will need an even better effort if he hopes to break his 0-3 record at 
the NCAA championships. Inexperience hurt his chances in 1990 and '91, and he 
came back from a redshirt year in 1992 with hopes of winning a match last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 A bout with the flu just before the tournament drained Maes' strength but not 
his determination. In his first match, the score was tied, 5-5, with 20 seconds 
left, but a "stupid move" landed Maes on his back. He lost, 10-5. 
</P>
<P>
 A lesson learned? Maes believes so. 
</P>
<P>
 "This year, I'll try to stay more healthy before the tournament," he said. 
"I'll stay away from people who are sick." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Numbers game: The Fullerton men's basketball team, which is 4-15 and 2-9 in 
the Big West, must win at least one of its final seven regular-season games, or 
at least one tournament game, to avoid matching the second-worst season in 
school history. The Titans were 1-25 in 1964-65 under Alex Omalev and were 4-23 
in 1980-81 under George McQuarn. 
</P>
<P>
 The Titans, who have lost three in a row and five of their last six, have 
lacked depth all season. 
</P>
<P>
 Injuries and the flu forced them to practice three on three for a time, and 
the team photo had to be rescheduled twice because of missing players. Forward 
Greg Vernon missed practice two weeks ago because of the flu, guard Josh King 
missed the UC Santa Barbara game after undergoing oral surgery and forward 
David Frigout is playing with a stress fracture in his left foot. 
</P>
<P>
 By early last week, everybody was back -- except forward Darren Little -- who 
missed practice to write a paper for a class. 
</P>
<P>
 The team photo finally was taken last Tuesday, when the Titans actually had 
enough players to scrimmage five on five. 
</P>
<P>
 Titan Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Better off the bench? Coach Brad Holland pulled Darren Little out of the 
starting lineup last Thursday night at Pacific for missing practices earlier in 
the week. Little responded with a season-high 23 points. Little returned to the 
starting lineup two days later at San Jose State and scored eight points. . . . 
Schedule changes: Earthquake damage at the Cal State Northridge campus has 
forced officials to move Sunday's Fullerton-Northridge softball doubleheader to 
Fullerton. The Feb. 19 Northridge-Fullerton baseball game also is expected to 
be moved from Northridge to Fullerton. . . . The men's soccer team, which 
reached the NCAA final four this past season, will meet FC Keli Linz, a club 
team from Australia, at 4:30 p.m. Saturday at Titan Stadium.

 LOCAL LINKS: Cypress teen Tiger Woods isn't playing the Los Angeles Open this 
year, but Orange County still will be represented when the PGA tour event 
starts today at Riviera Country Club. . . . Chris Tidland, a junior 
All-American at Oklahoma State who attended Placentia's Valencia High, and Bob 
May, a tour rookie who grew up in La Habra, will play in the same threesome. 
They tee off at 12:50 p.m.

 WATER SPORT: The annual Sports Illustrated swimsuit issue hit the newsstands 
Wednesday, with a different twist -- some of those people wearing very little 
are male. . . . Splashing amid the usual bikini-clad beauties like Kathy 
Ireland are five members of the summer Olympics-bound U.S. water polo team, 
which practices out of Newport Beach. Says Irvine attorney Rich Foster, 
president of U.S. Olympic Water Polo: "It's the greatest PR to ever happen to 
our sport." 
</P>
<P>
 ON THE MOVE: These are busy times for Tony Lam. The Westminster councilman 
leaves next week for an Asian American educational seminar in Israel, sponsored 
by the American Jewish Committee. Says Lam, the only Vietnamese American 
participant: "All my life, I have been interested in Jewish history, the 
perseverance of the people and their sense of community." . . . When he 
returns, there's a Ted Koppel "Nightline" special in the works about Lam and 
Little Saigon. "The more positive attention Little Saigon gets, the better," he 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 AS THE WORLD TURNS: How is this for awkward moments: Phyllis Gallagher, the 
lawyer who represented a Cypress police sergeant in her successful sexual 
harassment lawsuit against the department, was heading back to her office this 
week when her Jeep Cherokee was sideswiped. . . . So who stops to help her? 
Cypress Police Lt. James Weuve: He was one of Gallagher's targets. "This is 
really embarrassing," she told him. But he replied: "Don't think of it that 
way. This is a separate matter."

 QUAKE CLAIMS: It's a good thing 20th Century Insurance knew where to seek its 
own protection -- Lloyd's of London. That's because the Woodland Hills insurer 
estimates final quake claims to approach $160 million, even though homeowners 
face 10% deductibles on any of their damage claims. . . . Lloyd's didn't come 
cheaply, though -- $13 million a year, with a $10-million deductible.(D2)

 VERRRY INTERESTING: Gary Owens, formerly of "Laugh-In" fame, and, more 
important, ex-honorary mayor of Encino, will share the stage in October with 
Ronald Reagan as they join the National Broadcasters Hall of Fame. . . . 
Quipped Owens, a DJ for a Westwood radio station: "After people have heard my 
show, they'll know why I'm the one with more bodyguards."

 ASBESTOS: Things were already tough enough for property owners trying to get 
their lives back together after suffering quake damage. Now there's a new 
enemy: asbestos. . . . Hundreds of building owners and residents, such as Jeff 
Prey (above) of West Hills, must worry about the risk of asbestos 
contamination, as well as extra cleanup costs. Officials say many probably 
aren't even aware of the problem. (B1) 
</P>
<P>
 KIDS IN DANGER: The Jan. 17 quake, besides causing damage, has also opened 
eyes. It turns out that more than 200,000 children in licensed day-care centers 
in Los Angeles County could be very vulnerable in case of another temblor. . . 
. No regulations exist requiring safety glass, bolted bookcases and extra 
supplies of food and water. (B1) 
</P>
<P>
 LUCKY FINGER: His right middle finger looks funny these days, but Braden Weber 
isn't complaining. Just four months ago, Weber thought he might lose the 
finger. He was pumping iron when he smashed it between two weights, leaving the 
tip dangling. . . . Surgery put the finger back together. Weber is now a star 
hoopster for St. Francis High in La Canada. (C10) Michael Arkush

 FATAL SHOOTING: Two days after June Abe filed for divorce, 49-year-old Carl 
Abe fatally shot her before turning the gun on himself at the family's Moorpark 
home (B1). . . . The murder-suicide took place Wednesday morning while the 
couple's three children watched television. . . . Tina Silhavy of the Ventura 
County Coalition Against Domestic and Sexual Violence said such incidents have 
escalated in recent years. "Our future really rests on learning how to resolve 
our conflicts in peaceful ways," she said.

 OSCAR WATCH: The Academy Award nominations were unveiled Wednesday (E1). If 
Gini Swift had a vote for best director, she says she'd cast it for Steven 
Spielberg. . . . "I think he darn well deserves it," said Swift, president of 
the Ojai Film Society. "That man is a genius." . . . Spielberg's Holocaust 
drama "Schindler's List" received 12 Oscar nominations, including for best 
picture and best director. The movie maker has been shut out in his three 
previous directorial nominations.

SMOKING INCREASES WOMEN'S RISK OF BRITTLE BONES, STUDY FINDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Women who smoke run a higher risk of developing brittle bones late in life 
than women who do not smoke, two Australian researchers report in the New 
England Journal of Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
 The researchers said they studied 41 pairs of female twins and uncovered fresh 
evidence that smoking can play a key role in the development of the brittle 
bones that are the hallmark of osteoporosis. 
</P>
<P>
 The finding "has major consequences for public health," said the authors, John 
Llewelyn Hopper and Dr. Ego Seeman of the University of Melbourne. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on cigarette consumption and measurements of bone density, they found 
that if one twin smokes an extra pack of cigarettes each day for 10 years, her 
lower backbone will be 2% less dense and her leg bones 1% less dense than the 
bones of her twin. 
</P>
<P>
 When one twin smoked two more packs per day than the other, her backbone 
density was 9% less. 
</P>
<P>
 A 10% drop in bone density over 10 years translates into a 44% increase in the 
likelihood of a fracture. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the number of pack-a-day smokers in the United States has doubled in 
the last two decades, "this study suggests that by the 21st Century there will 
be an increase in fractures attributable to smoking," they said. 
</P>
<P>
 In an editorial in the same issue, Charles Slemenda of the Indiana University 
School of Medicine said doctors should be telling women that when they smoke 
they are increasing the likelihood of brittle bones as they age. 
</P>
<P>
 The female hormone estrogen is known to prevent a woman's bones from losing 
their strength with age. Smoking, Slemenda said, seems to make estrogen less 
effective. It may also have a poisonous effect on bones. 
</P>
<P>
 Hopper and Seeman studied twins because a person's genetic makeup can 
influence the risk of developing brittle bones. When twins are compared, those 
genetic differences are eliminated.

RAYMOND SCOTT; COMPOSED QUIRKY, INNOVATIVE MUSIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MYRNA OLIVER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Raymond Scott, the innovative composer, pianist and electronic music pioneer 
whose quirky works spanned the decades and musical styles from radio jazz shows 
to "Your Hit Parade" to Nickelodeon's hit cartoon, "The Ren & Stimpy Show," has 
died. He was 85. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott, who lived in Van Nuys, died of pneumonia Tuesday at a nursing home in 
North Hills. He had been unable to speak and was largely incapacitated by a 
series of strokes that began in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 He began composing in the 1930s, and his works had recently enjoyed a 
resurgence of popularity with Columbia's CD reissue last year of "The Music of 
Raymond Scott: Reckless Nights and Turkish Twilights." The recordings are 
currently heard on the cult cartoon favorite "Ren & Stimpy." 
</P>
<P>
 Another recent album, "The Raymond Scott Project, Volume 1: Powerhouse" has 
been released by Stash Records. 
</P>
<P>
 Several music and animation experts are attempting to preserve Scott's musical 
output at the Marr Sound Archives of the University of Missouri in Kansas City. 
"This is irreplaceable stuff," Mix magazine columnist David Goggin, who is 
involved in the archive effort, told The Times last year. "We feel that in 100 
years historians will be very curious about this lone genius." 
</P>
<P>
 Scott first gained fame with his six-piece "Quintet" (so-called because he 
preferred the sound of the word to "sextet" and didn't count himself) in the 
late 1930s, playing his swing "Powerhouse" and other compositions on CBS radio 
and in concerts. 
</P>
<P>
 "Scott's music has been called 'instrumental literature,' 'program jazz' and 
other things," Times Hollywood columnist Philip K. Scheuer said in 1937. "It 
sounds like dissonant ragtime, the dissonances providing the modern, or arty, 
touch; and it's often pretty swell." 
</P>
<P>
 Scott went on to lead big bands in the 1940s, and in 1943, as music director 
for CBS, formed the first racially mixed radio orchestra. In 1946 he wrote the 
music to Bernard Hanighen's lyrics for the Broadway musical "Lute Song" 
starring Mary Martin and Yul Brynner. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Scott did not specifically compose for cartoons, more than a dozen of 
his mixed jazz, pop and classical compositions were used by Warner Bros. music 
director Carl Stalling in the soundtracks accompanying Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, 
Elmer Fudd and Porky Pig in "Merrie Melodies" and "Looney Tunes" in the 1940s. 
In 1989, East Orange, N.J., radio personality Irwin Chusid became a Scott fan 
and worked to obtain credit and royalties for Scott for all his compositions 
and to develop the 1993 CD. 
</P>
<P>
 "His quintet was music for the 20th Century," Chusid told The Times last year, 
describing how he got hooked on Scott's music when a fan sent him a 1930s 
record to play on the air. "It was pop in the best sense of the word: catchy, 
memorable, with melodies that would just get lodged in your subconscious, and 
you could not get rid of them." 
</P>
<P>
 From 1950 to 1957, Scott conducted the orchestra on the NBC television series 
"Your Hit Parade," for which he composed the opening and closing tunes, "Be 
Happy" and "So Long for a While." 
</P>
<P>
 "The more haunting the theme the better the recognition value," he said in 
1955 at a time when he was also composing jingles for television and radio 
commercials. "It also generates a feeling of interest and psychologically sets 
the stage for the program. A happy theme denotes a happy program." 
</P>
<P>
 A serious, somewhat reclusive workaholic who admitted that he had to have 
people make faces at him to enable him to smile for the television camera on 
"Hit Parade," Scott provided a sense of fun in his music and his descriptive 
titles. Trumpet spooks howl in his "New Year's Eve in a Haunted House"; 
tom-toms beat menacingly through "Dinner Music for a Pack of Hungry Cannibals," 
and a seasick saxophone dominates "Reckless Night on Board an Ocean Liner." 
</P>
<P>
 Scott was also an inventor, using early synthesizers, and in his final years 
he composed music on a computer. One of his earliest electronic concoctions was 
"Karloff," named for the horror movie actor Boris Karloff, which imitated the 
sounds of kitchen clatter, jungle drums and a steak frying. His "Clavicox" was 
a keyboard instrument that imitated the sound of a human voice. 
</P>
<P>
 His "Electronium," an instrument panel that lit up like the cockpit of a jet 
and which he said could compose music by itself, captured the imagination of 
Berry Gordy Jr. of Motown Records. Gordy hired Scott to head Motown's 
electronic music division from 1972 until Scott's retirement in 1977, and he 
moved Scott from his native New York to the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Born Harry Warnow in Brooklyn, N.Y., the composer wanted to be an engineer but 
was persuaded by his father, who owned a music shop, and his brother, conductor 
Mark Warnow, to attend the Institute of Musical Art, which became the Juilliard 
School. Scott studied piano and upon graduation in 1931 was hired as staff 
pianist with the CBS radio house band, which his brother conducted. 
</P>
<P>
 But he soon became bored, started composing his eccentric but lasting jazz pop 
tunes, and organized his quintet. He picked a new name out of the New York 
telephone book, choosing Raymond Scott because it "sounded nice and had good 
rhythm." 
</P>
<P>
 Previously married to Pearl Winters and Dorothy Collins, Scott is survived by 
his wife of 26 years, Mitzi, four children and 10 grandchildren.

YESTERDAY . . . . AND TODAY; WILL AMERICA STILL NEED THE BEATLES WHEN THEY'RE 
64? 30 YEARS AFTER DEBUT ON TV, THE ANSWER IS PROBABLY YES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GORDON DILLOW, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's the sort of comment that, coming from a grown man, can make a middle-aged 
baby boomer suddenly feel old. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Beatles? Oh yeah, I was a big Beatles fan -- when I was young. I used to 
borrow old Beatles records from my Mom." 
</P>
<P>
 The speaker is Kevin Ratner, 26, of Venice, one of dozens of people 
interviewed Wednesday about the 30th anniversary of the Beatles' appearance on 
the "Ed Sullivan Show" in 1964 -- an event that occurred years before Ratner 
and almost half the rest of the American population was even born. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on those interviews, several Beatles-related conclusions can be drawn: 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone has heard of the Beatles. Most people, regardless of age, say they 
like the Beatles. Almost everyone over the age of 35 can name the Beatles. 
Almost no one under the age of 35 knows who Ed Sullivan was. 
</P>
<P>
 And, finally, the interviews indicate that for Americans in their 40s, the 
Beatles' first Ed Sullivan appearance was more than just a TV show. It was a 
landmark cultural event, a youthful snapshot rendered in grainy black and 
white, a silly, happy generational-shared experience from the days before the 
1960s got too serious. 
</P>
<P>
 For the benefit of younger readers, a little background may be in order: 
</P>
<P>
 The Beatles -- John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, Ringo Starr -- 
released their first album in America, "Meet the Beatles," in January, 1964. By 
Feb. 1, the song "I Want to Hold Your Hand" hit No. 1 on the Billboard charts; 
two months later, Beatles songs occupied all five top slots on the Billboard 
singles chart. 
</P>
<P>
 On Feb. 7, 1964, the shockingly long-haired Beatles arrived in New York from 
their native England; two days later they made their first appearance on the 
"Ed Sullivan Show," a hugely popular Sunday night variety program, in front of 
a studio audience largely composed of screaming, crying, semi-hysterical 
teen-age girls. The show garnered what was then the largest TV audience in 
history -- 57 million viewers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Absolutely I remember watching the show," said Quince Buteau, a 42-year-old 
Hollywood Hills packaging designer, as he browsed through the CD racks at Tower 
Records in West Hollywood. "It was a super big deal. I remember my parents 
saying nobody will even know who they are six months from now. . . . I still 
have their records. Every now and then I take them out and spin 'em." 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember the show, I remember all the screaming," says Terry Abrahamson, 
42, a Chicago music composer in town to to work on a film. "I bought all their 
albums. Now I have three kids -- 7, 5 and 2 -- and they're getting into it 
(Beatles music). 'Rocky Raccoon,' 'Yellow Submarine.' There's something about 
it they respond to." 
</P>
<P>
 For the most part, younger music lovers interviewed said they liked the 
Beatles -- or at least they were polite enough to say they did when asked about 
them by a newspaper reporter who obviously dated back to the early Beatles era. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like most of their songs," said Mirna Pontaza, 21, a pre-dentistry student 
at Los Angeles City College. "I think it's pretty cool that they've been around 
for so long. My parents told me about them. They saw them at Dodger Stadium (in 
1966)." 
</P>
<P>
 "I like 'em OK," said Eric Baugh, 17, as he and a friend walked outside 
Hollywood High School. "They're sort of like acid music." 
</P>
<P>
 For some, Beatles music still seems young -- three decades later. 
</P>
<P>
 "Thirty years isn't really that long," said Steve Johnson, 38, a North 
Hollywood driver-courier. "A hundred years from now, they'll still be listening 
to Beatles music." Tammy Laub, 26, manager at Tower Records, says the Beatles 
are "an endless phenomenon." 
</P>
<P>
 "There isn't just one age group that buys them; everybody buys them," she 
said. "Their music is something that, no matter what your age, is going to 
bring back memories for you. We're selling about a box per title every week" -- 
about 25 each of about a dozen different Beatles albums and song collections in 
the store. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, they don't actually sell Beatles records at Tower Records, or 
almost anyplace else, for that matter. It's all compact discs and cassettes.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It may or may not mean anything, but the Beatles CDs in Tower Records are 
situated right next to a CD called "The Beavis and Butt-head Experience." 
</P>
<P>
 For the benefit of some older readers, Beavis and Butt-head are MTV animated 
teen-age characters who, many adult Americans believe, represent the beginning 
of the end of Western civilization as we know it, which is exactly what many 
adult Americans thought the Beatles represented in 1964.

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; COUNCIL PLEDGES $10.9 MILLION FOR COLISEUM 
REPAIR; RECOVERY: FUNDS COME FROM FIRST FEDERAL GRANTS. CITY ATTORNEY IS 
ORDERED TO DETERMINE IF ANYONE IS LIABLE FOR FAILING TO RELAY A 1991 REPORT 
THAT STADIUM WAS VULNERABLE TO QUAKE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles City Council voted Wednesday to allocate $10.9 million from 
the first $75 million in federal earthquake grants to the city to start 
repairing the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. The vote came two days before an 
expected structural engineer's report on the full extent of quake damage to the 
historic stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, the council instructed City Atty. James K. Hahn to report on 
whether the Coliseum's managers, the Spectacor Management Group, its architects 
or any other parties failed to comply with their responsibilities by failing to 
give the Coliseum Commission a 1991 report warning that the structure was 
vulnerable to a large earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 The motion by Councilman Joel Wachs also instructed Hahn to advise the council 
on legal remedies it could pursue against any party he finds to have been 
negligent in the handling of the 1991 report. 
</P>
<P>
 No seismic retrofit was undertaken at the stadium between 1991 and the 
Northridge earthquake. Preliminary estimates are that the damage discovered so 
far in the Coliseum will cost $33 million to $35 million to repair. 
</P>
<P>
 The same structural engineer who warned of the quake danger in 1991, Nabib 
Youssef of Los Angeles, has been retained to give a more detailed report on the 
damage, probably by Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 As the first federal money was made available for repairs, the new Coliseum 
Commission president, Los Angeles County Supervisor Yvonne Brathwaite Burke, 
said the commission's legal counsel has concluded that Coliseum authorities 
have no continuing contracts with architects or builders under which the work 
could be done. 
</P>
<P>
 Two firms -- the Tutor-Saliba construction group and HNTB architects -- 
completed a $15-million renovation of the stadium last year, lowering the 
playing field and adding thousands of new lower-level seats. 
</P>
<P>
 Burke said a normal bidding procedure, which would contain specifications for 
repair work, would take months, ruling out repair of the facility before the 
next football season. But she said the Coliseum Commission would meet in 
special session next week, in the wake of the engineer's report, to consider 
two alternatives that might allow the Raiders and USC to play in the stadium 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
 One would be an abbreviated bidding process, she said, which might take as 
little as seven days. Architects and construction companies would be asked to 
bid only on a cost-plus-profit basis, with the plans and construction details 
to come later. 
</P>
<P>
 A second alternative would be "a finding by us that it is not in the interest 
of the Coliseum to put this out to bid," she said. Under this emergency 
procedure, the commission would simply select a company to do the work. 
</P>
<P>
 "Detailed specifications are going to be impossible for us if we are going to 
get this done," Burke said in an interview. "It's highly unlikely we can use 
the usual procedures." 
</P>
<P>
 Burke and the commission's project manager, Don C. Webb, cited ongoing freeway 
reconstruction in the wake of the earthquake as an example of how a project can 
be designed and constructed simultaneously. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Burke nor Webb said they knew precisely what would be in the 
engineer's report expected Friday, but both expressed confidence the Coliseum 
could be reconstructed at an acceptable price, without substantial demolition 
first.

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; STUDENTS GET A TASTE OF CABIN FEVER; SCHOOLS: 
FOR NEARLY 2,000 TEEN-AGERS WHO USUALLY TRAVEL FROM OTHER PARTS OF L.A. TO WEST 
VALLEY CAMPUSES, THIS VACATION IS UNWANTED.

 The last worry on Rachel Moreno's mind is her high school's quake-crumbled 
administration building and the classrooms she will never sit in again.

 "I just want to see my friends," said the 14-year-old Kennedy High School 
student. "I just want to be with everybody, my teachers, everyone." 
</P>
<P>
 It is week three of, yes, an unwanted vacation for nearly 5,000 students at 
Kennedy and El Camino Real high schools in the San Fernando Valley, whose 
broken campuses have been closed since the Jan. 17 earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 But for one large block of those students -- the ones who live over the hill 
in other parts of Los Angeles and are bused as far as 30 miles to campus -- the 
separation from school has left many feeling isolated from friends and abruptly 
severed from their social lives in the Valley. After staying home while most 
others their age went back to school, these teen-agers are expressing a new 
appreciation for their rigorous school routine, a day that typically starts 
before dawn and includes a daily commute of up to three hours in lumbering 
school buses. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even though it's far away, school is a big part of me," said Jennifer Rivas, 
17, a Kennedy senior who lives near Downtown. "I always liked my school, but 
now my appreciation has grown." 
</P>
<P>
 Some traveling students said they have felt cooped up at home, without a car 
and with admonishments from their parents not to run up phone charges. 
</P>
<P>
 "All my friends live in the Valley -- I can't call them because the bill will 
be too high," said Rivas, a drill team member who usually woke up at 5 a.m. to 
catch the bus and because of practice didn't get home on most days until about 
8 p.m. "School is my home away from home." 
</P>
<P>
 About 990 youths from the city and the East Valley ride buses to 2,300-student 
Kennedy High School in Granada Hills. El Camino Real in Woodland Hills, with a 
2,700 student body, takes in about 1,000 traveling students.

 Several hundred of these students from Kennedy and El Camino flocked to 
meetings this week that were for many their first reunion with teachers and 
classmates since the quake. The meetings were held in the gymnasiums at Manual 
Arts and Crenshaw high schools, closer to the neighborhoods where the students 
live. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the sessions were designed to bring parents up to date on 
quake-related school issues, the students searched out their friends and 
crowded around teachers, asking questions about the campus damage they have 
only seen on television. There were hugs and smiles all around. 
</P>
<P>
 "What about the work bench, did that fall?" 16-year-old Roderick Crow asked 
his El Camino wood shop teacher, Barry Lampke, as they greeted each other with 
hearty slaps on the back. 
</P>
<P>
 No, the computer didn't fall, Lampke reassured the student. "What about the 
tools?" Crow fired back. "They all fell, but it's not a big deal," the teacher 
replied. 
</P>

 Ricardo Manzo, a tackle on the Kennedy football team, has been reduced to 
watching daytime talk shows to occupy his time. Carlos Zavala, a defensive end 
on the Kennedy team who lives in South-Central Los Angeles, used to wake up at 
5:30 a.m. on school days. He now sleeps in until 10:30, then putters around the 
house blasting rap music until his parents get home from work and he can take 
the car to work out at the gym. 
</P>
<P>
 "You really can't enjoy the time off because it came so suddenly," Zavala 
said. "Any day they can say school will be open. I just live one day at a 
time." 
</P>
<P>
 Norma Cardenas, a Kennedy sophomore from South-Central Los Angeles, said 
resuming classes will feel like a vacation after cooking and cleaning her house 
for nearly a month. 
</P>
<P>
 "Going back to school will be like a homecoming," she said. "It's been so 
boring at my house. Every time I see the clock I think about what period I 
would be in. Right now it's fifth period, typing." 
</P>
<P>
 School officials have said the weeks of uncertainty are coming to a close as 
they rush to open both schools in portable classroom trailers. Firm reopening 
dates have not yet been settled, but El Camino Principal Joyce Washington said 
she expects the gates to open "in a couple of weeks." Kennedy is aiming for 
Feb. 15. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the Kennedy and El Camino students said they are pleased that the 
district did not disperse them to schools closer to home, and instead chose to 
keep them together with their classmates. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wouldn't feel comfortable going to another school," said Cardenas. "I've 
been going to school in the Valley since junior high. I'm used to it already." 
A few students said they would feel like outsiders in their neighborhood 
schools because they have spent most of their young lives on Valley campuses. 
</P>
<P>
 Some parents said they have looked into switching their children to nearby 
schools, and a few dozen of the traveling students have transferred to Fremont 
High in South-Central and to Taft and Granada Hills highs in the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 But most parents said they wanted their children to stay with the schools 
where they have friends and know the teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is my choice. I want my daughter to keep going to school in the Valley," 
said Jewell Martin, who lives near Baldwin Hills and whose ninth-grader attends 
El Camino.

INTRUDERS KILL DAUGHTER OF EL SEGUNDO COUNCILMAN; CRIME: VICTIM'S DAUGHTER 
SURVIVES ATTACK. FOUR SUSPECTS, INCLUDING A FORMER ROOMMATE, ARE ARRESTED.

 The daughter of an El Segundo city councilman was stabbed to death and her 
12-year-old daughter's throat was slashed during an attack early Wednesday 
morning in their El Segundo apartment. 
</P>
<P>
 Police arrested four suspects Wednesday afternoon in connection with the 
slaying of Tairree Lynne West. Using a description of the assailants provided 
by the injured girl, police arrested Robert Brendan Foster, an 18-year-old 
transient, on suspicion of murder near a Hollywood YMCA. 
</P>
<P>
 Marcus Brewington, 19, Linette Blocker, 18, and Erica Olsen were being held 
for questioning. 
</P>
<P>
 West, who allowed Olsen to stay in her home for days at a time in exchange for 
baby-sitting, recently received a large amount of money, El Segundo Police Sgt. 
Bill Fleming said. Foster and Olsen were arrested after they arrived at the 
YMCA in West's 1987 Nissan. West, 25, the daughter of Councilman Alan West, was 
stabbed in the upper body and appeared to have been strangled in the attack 
about 1:30 a.m., said Sheriff's Deputy Fidel Gonzalez. She was taken to Robert 
F. Kennedy Medical Center, where she was pronounced dead an hour later. 
</P>
<P>
 Ashley West, 12, who was adopted by West several years ago, was listed in fair 
condition at UCLA Medical Center. The girl, a sixth-grader at El Segundo Middle 
School, passed out after calling 911, Fleming said. She had a nine-inch gash 
from the top of her cheek to the middle of her throat and the attackers 
probably thought she was dead, Fleming said. Relatives are caring for Tairree 
West's 6-month-old daughter, Carlie, who was found gagged but otherwise 
unharmed on a living room couch. 
</P>
<P>
 The attackers ransacked the victims' apartment during the apparent robbery. 
West recently received a check for $5,000 to $10,000, but it was not taken, 
police said.  
</P>
<P>
 J. B. Wise, an El Segundo councilman and close friend of the family, said 
Tairree West "was just El Segundo country-type people. You always feel welcome 
around the whole family." 
</P>
<P>
 The godparents of West's two daughters, who asked not to be named, spent 
Tuesday evening at a family celebration. They left at about 11, the godmother 
said. The next day she heard her friend had been killed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't believe it," she said. "I keep thinking I can just call her up." 
</P>
<P>
 West, who graduated from El Segundo High School, was separated from her 
husband, who is in the military in Georgia, the friend said.  
</P>
<P>
 West adopted Ashley after the girl's mother -- Tairree's best friend -- died, 
the friend said. Ashley was studying drama and dance in Hollywood while 
attending middle school and has appeared in one commercial.  
</P>
<P>
 A part-time worker at her brother's El Segundo cleaning business, West lived 
with her children in an apartment complex near busy Imperial Highway. Residents 
there said they endure the noisy jets at nearby Los Angeles International 
Airport because their neighborhood has very little crime. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone pretty much knows each other," said Denise Hearne, 26, who lives 
with her boyfriend in a nearby unit.  
</P>
<P>
 Patricia Moran, 26, said she moved to the neighborhood with her husband and 
baby a year ago to escape the crime in nearby Inglewood.  
</P>
<P>
 But some residents in the area feared that the recently completed Century 
Freeway would bring more crime into the community. Wise's apartment building 
sits a mile from the freeway's terminus in El Segundo. 
</P>
<P>
 El Segundo, a city of 15,223, is an enclave just west of Sepulveda Boulevard 
in the South Bay. The town is so sheltered that residents sometimes call it 
their "Mayberry." 
</P>
<P>
 The mostly industrial city, home of Chevron, Hughes Aircraft, Northrop and 
Rockwell, had only one murder last year, police said.  
</P>

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; RISK TO CHILDREN FEARED IN LACK OF SEISMIC LAWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 More than 200,000 children in licensed day care in Los Angeles County are 
potentially among the most vulnerable in an earthquake because no regulations 
exist requiring safety glass, bolted bookcases, extra supplies of food and 
water or even working flashlights in child-care centers, experts say. 
</P>
<P>
 Structural seismic safety regulations that apply to public schools do not 
apply to day-care centers, some of which are in former public school buildings 
that do not meet state requirements, said Joel McRonald, chief of special 
programs in the state architect's office. 
</P>
<P>
 Public school buildings are required to have more reinforcement than other 
structures, such as extra bracing in walls and extra strong connections between 
foundations, walls, and ceilings.  
</P>
<P>
 Although buildings that do not have such extra reinforcement still may be 
structurally sound, McRonald said it is a pet peeve of his that regulations are 
less stringent for day-care centers than for public schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we're mandating (that) K-12 can't be in the buildings," he said, "why are 
we allowing preschoolers?" 
</P>
<P>
 Many parents were relieved not to be separated from their children during the 
earthquake. And in the wake of the disaster, many are shocked when they hear 
that there are virtually no regulations requiring earthquake preparedness in 
licensed family day-care homes beyond maintaining a list of emergency contact 
numbers. 
</P>
<P>
 Requirements at school-type day-care centers are only slightly stricter. Such 
facilities must hold semiannual disaster drills and assign staff to handle 
specific functions, but child-care workers say there is sometimes little real 
preparedness even though the plans exist on paper. 
</P>
<P>
 The quake was a wake-up call for many parents and child-care providers that 
they are not as prepared as they should be. Looking at the wreckage of day-care 
centers or homes of day-care providers, parents realize that tragedy may have 
been averted only because of the early hour of the temblor. 
</P>
<P>
 For many Angelenos, day care is as essential as water or transportation. With 
many day-care centers and homes closed because of earthquake damage, some 
parents cannot go to work to earn income they need to put their lives back 
together, and some people have lost their jobs because they have had to stay 
home and care for children. 
</P>
<P>
 According to estimates by the nonprofit Childcare Resource Center, about 10% 
to 15% of licensed child-care providers in the San Fernando Valley were shut 
down for up to three weeks after the earthquake. Although virtually all 
school-type day-care centers have reopened, dozens of family day-care homes 
serving hundreds of children remain closed due to earthquake damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Day-care centers in private homes are inspected once every three years, and 
inspectors are not required to check for earthquake preparedness. Because such 
centers are in homes, they often contain ordinary hazards such as china 
cabinets and unsecured bookshelves and television sets. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, the ratio of children to adults is higher in the family centers than 
in most homes. A single adult at a licensed family day-care facility may 
legally be responsible for up to four infants, or three infants and three 
preschoolers -- more than could be carried to safety by one person at a time. 
</P>
<P>
 In unlicensed homes, where hundreds of thousands of Los Angeles children are 
cared for, the situation may be even worse, experts say, because many more 
children may be supervised by a single adult and the houses are not inspected.  
</P>
<P>
 One licensed family-care provider in Canoga Park shuddered at the thought of 
an earthquake occurring when she was alone with the six children in her care. 
As it was, when the earthquake occurred at 4:31 a.m., she and her husband had 
only tiny flashlights, so they lit candles -- which she now knows could have 
caused a gas explosion. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, a large unbolted wall unit stands in the room where the children 
play. She pointed out that she has a week's supply of food on hand, but then 
realized that most of it is in a freezer and would quickly spoil if the 
electricity failed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Among family day-care homes, a lot don't have any idea about earthquake 
preparedness. Zero. None," said Michael Bailey, owner of a Northridge 
child-care referral agency. 
</P>
<P>
 However, many family day-care providers had taken precautions. Diane Wilson, 
who cares for several children in her Granada Hills home, had her husband bolt 
bookcases to the walls, and she keeps water, food, tools, tents and other 
emergency supplies in the garage.  
</P>
<P>
 Still, when the earthquake hit, the house was such a wreck that family members 
suffered minor injuries trying to get outside. After their house was 
yellow-tagged, allowing only limited entry, the Wilsons baby-sat children in a 
tent in their yard. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the light regulation of day-care providers and their wide 
variations in safety preparations, it is up to parents to ensure that their 
children's day-care environments are safe, experts agree. 
</P>
<P>
 Day-care centers are not covered under the Field Act -- the law requiring 
extra safe school structures -- because at the time the law was passed in the 
early 1930s few centers existed. The act covers only public schools, not 
private institutions such as day schools or child-care centers. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Tobin, executive director of the state Seismic Safety Commission, 
expressed concern for the safety of children. He recalled that after the 
Whittier Narrows quake in 1989, he was dismayed to see that a heavy cornice had 
fallen off a masonry church, plunged through a roof and landed on a crib in the 
church's day-care center. Fortunately, no children were there at the time, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 But he said the commission has not studied the issue of regulating day-care 
centers for earthquake safety. He said it would examine damage reports to see 
what new initiatives might be appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
 But many child-care advocates are wary of increasing regulations, which they 
say could raise the cost of care for already-strapped parents, or force 
day-care providers out of business. 
</P>
<P>
 Regardless of regulations, many operators say the quake has prompted them to 
beef up their earthquake preparations. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's actually been a very good learning experience," said Donna Halsey, who 
had to shut down temporarily all three of the centers she owns in the West 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Halsey says she will do a better job of securing furniture to walls, and make 
sure that flashlights are where they are supposed to be. She said she will 
stock more water and put the television inside a latched cupboard instead of on 
top of it, unbolted. 
</P>
<P>
 One model for earthquake preparedness is the Caltech/JPL Child Educational 
Center, where seismologists Lucile Jones and Egill Hauksson have their 
children. At this center, where the Sierra Madre fault is visible from the 
parking lot, the 90-member staff seems as well-trained as a National Guard 
unit. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to monthly drills, the 200-child center holds half-day earthquake 
exercises every six months, deploying triage tents, walkie-talkies, extra water 
and food and staffers trained in search-and-rescue techniques. 
</P>
<P>
 Babies are popped into cribs with heavy-duty wagon wheels, and preschoolers 
put on emergency backpacks as they file out onto a field. Assigned teams of 
staffers set up everything from a communications center to a morgue. 
</P>
<P>
 Bobbie Edwards, who is in charge of the center's earthquake preparations, 
emphasizes the need for parental involvement. On the school's regularly 
scheduled "parent work days," parents helped bolt down fans and bookshelves, 
saving the school labor costs. The center also asks parents to contribute a $5 
annual earthquake preparedness fee and provide the earthquake backpacks. 
</P>
<P>
 Teaching children about earthquakes will help calm them when disaster strikes, 
Edwards says. Jones periodically brings in a seismograph for show-and-tell 
sessions, and uses a block of Jell-O with a piece of wood on it to show how 
buildings wobble, depending on how close they are to the epicenter. At this 
center, children as young as 18 months know how to duck and cover their heads. 
</P>
<P>
 Elyssa Nelson, director of the center, is proud of the aplomb with which 
3-year-old Jenna Muirhead handled the earthquake: "That one was really good 
practice," she told her mother. 
</P>
<P>
 Dealing with the psychological aftermath of the quake is perhaps the biggest 
task for most day-care providers now. Although many preschoolers appear to be 
unaffected by the jolts, others are suffering sleep problems, bed-wetting and 
even vomiting because of the stress. 
</P>
<P>
 Gayle Tolbert-Myles, who runs a family day-care home near La Brea Avenue and 
Washington Boulevard, says she is struggling to deal with her own trauma while 
reassuring the children. She moved into her present house after fleeing a 
neighborhood that went up in flames during the riots, and says the stress is 
cumulative for adults and children. 
</P>
<P>
 "One little girl was playing on the (toy) phone. She says, 'We need help, this 
house is shaking and cracking,' " Tolbert-Myles said. Several of the children 
in her care were left homeless by the earthquake.  
</P>
<P>
 Tolbert-Myles has asked parents to bring family photos to soothe the children 
if they must be separated from their parents. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't prevent an earthquake. But I can be prepared," she said. "The rest is 
in the Lord's hands." Caring for Children 
</P>
<P>
 Parents need to work with day-care providers to make sure that their 
children's environment is safe and that their post-disaster emotional needs are 
met, experts say. Some sources of earthquake preparedness information and

<P>
 Acknowledging the city's ethnic diversity and the tensions that stem from it, 
the Los Angeles City Council has voted to expand its Human Relations Commission 
and set up a special committee to study ways of improving race relations. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas, who proposed the measure, said the blue-ribbon 
committee on race relations will work to highlight the city's diverse 
communities and to prevent conflicts. 
</P>
<P>
 Ridley-Thomas called the city's existing Human Relations Commission woefully 
inadequate, noting that it has only two full-time staffers and a budget of 
$100,000.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; ALARCON 
SEEKS MORATORIUM ON UNDERGROUND PIPELINES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Angered by a blaze that was fueled by oil from a quake-ruptured pipeline in 
Pacoima, Los Angeles City Councilman Richard Alarcon said Wednesday he will 
seek a moratorium on new agreements to operate such underground pipelines in 
the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The moratorium is likely to delay the renewal of expired franchise agreements 
between the city and four petroleum companies that want to continue pumping oil 
through existing pipelines under streets throughout the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Alarcon's move also may have an impact on the city's consideration of a 
proposed pipeline that would run parallel to railroad tracks in the northeast 
San Fernando Valley, only a few blocks east of the site of the Jan. 17 fire, 
which injured one man and burned 17 cars and three homes. 
</P>
<P>
 That pipeline, which would carry oil 52 miles from Santa Clarita to 
Wilmington, is scheduled to be discussed today at a meeting of the Los Angeles 
Board of Transportation Commissioners. 
</P>
<P>
 Alarcon, whose district includes the neighborhood that burned after the 
pipeline break, said he will ask the City Council to adopt the moratorium until 
an investigation of the rupture on Wolfskill Street in Pacoima can be 
completed. 
</P>
<P>
 It was one of eight breaks that occurred along a 35-mile span of the Four 
Corners Pipeline. One rupture killed hundreds of fish and other wildlife in the 
Santa Clara River in Valencia.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; ACTOR 
ACQUITTED IN ALLEGED RAPE ON 'SISTER ACT II' SET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A jury deliberated less than four hours Wednesday before acquitting an actor 
of raping a 16-year-old extra last summer on the set of "Sister Act II." 
</P>
<P>
 The jury also found Ron Johnson, 21, not guilty of raping a 19-year-old woman, 
who came forward after seeing news accounts of the extra's accusations.She 
accused Johnson of raping her in 1992 after she met him at a house party. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson, who had a role in the movie "Zebrahead" and who got into acting after 
winning a call-in rap contest on a local radio station, played a student in 
"Sister Act II." 
</P>
<P>
 The unpaid extra was one of hundreds who were in a school auditorium scene. At 
his his trial, Johnson conceded that he had had sex with the extra, but he 
maintained that it was consensual. 
</P>
<P>
 He had never met the other woman, he said, although he acknowledged being at 
the party she described with his girlfriend and performing raps there.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: INGLEWOOD; REWARD 
OFFERED IN SLAYINGS ON TWO NIGHTS OF VIOLENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A reward totaling $25,000 was announced this week for information leading to 
arrests and convictions in shootings that left five people dead in Inglewood 
during two nights of violence last month.  
</P>
<P>
 The Inglewood City Council authorized the payment for information in the 
attacks that killed two people Jan. 26 and three more the next night, Inglewood 
spokesman Truman Jacques said.Police described the violent nights as two of the 
worst in the city's history.  
</P>
<P>
 On Jan. 31, police arrested a 16-year-old boy in the shooting death of 
14-year-old Tila French, who was killed about 7:30 on the first night. She was 
standing with friends in front of an apartment building in the 800 block of 
North Eucalyptus Avenue when the shooting started. Two other teen-agers were 
wounded in the attack. The suspect, whose name was withheld, was charged with 
one count of murder and two counts of attempted murder. About half an hour 
before French was killed, 2-year-old Kyiara Morrow-Jackson was killed and her 
mother was wounded by shots fired in front of their house in the 2500 block of 
West 78th Street. Three other people were wounded in separate attacks that 
night.  
</P>
<P>
 The next night, three Inglewood men were gunned down as they sat in a car in 
the 700 block of North Market Street. Garland Money, 21, and Kenneth Cannon, 
24, died at the scene. Sean Williams, 17, died at a hospital.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; MISTRIAL 
DECLARED FOR TWO EX-BALDWIN PARK OFFICERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A mistrial was declared this week in the excessive-force trial of two former 
Baldwin Park police officers after a Los Angles Superior Court jury failed to 
decide whether the officers beat a burglary suspect during an arrest three 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The jury deliberated for 5 1/2 days in the trial of Louis Price, 38, and 
Kenneth Shearen, 29.Thy were accused of beating convicted burglar Gilbert 
Gutierrez on Feb. 11, 1991, after a gas station mini-store was burglarized. 
Jurors voted 6 to 6 to convict Price and 7 to 5 to convict Shearen. 
</P>
<P>
 The former officers, who were dismissed from their jobs for using excessive 
force, return to court Feb. 17. The district attorney's office will seek a 
retrial. But defense attorneys called the case "ludicrous," saying that medical 
evidence did not support the beating allegations.

ACLU PLANS MEDIA CAMPAIGN PROMOTING GUN CONTROL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BETTINA BOXALL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Wading into the stormy waters of the gun control debate, the American Civil 
Liberties Union of Southern California is launching a campaign to counter 
arguments that gun control legislation runs afoul of the constitutional right 
to bear arms. 
</P>
<P>
 "For far too long, the gun lobby's myths about the 2nd Amendment have 
prevented a rational debate about gun control," said Ramona Ripston, director 
of the organization, whose offices are located in a Los Angeles neighborhood 
where random gunfire is common. 
</P>
<P>
 Fresh from a state crime summit in which the ACLU was bitterly attacked for 
its civil libertarian stands, Ripston complained at a Wednesday news conference 
of meek and hypocritical legislators who are unwilling to pass gun control 
laws. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very interesting that there are all these proposals to control crime and 
nobody -- at least in the sessions I was in -- talked about guns," Ripston 
said, referring to the summit called by Gov. Pete Wilson. "A way of controlling 
crime is to control guns." 
</P>
<P>
 The Southern California ACLU affiliate will argue in newspaper advertisements, 
brochures and lectures that gun control and the Constitution's 2nd Amendment 
are thoroughly compatible. 
</P>
<P>
 "As an advocate of our freedoms under the U.S. Constitution, the ACLU wants to 
set the record straight on what our forefathers truly intended about our right 
to bear arms," Ripston said in a prepared statement. 
</P>
<P>
 The group's new brochure bears a photo of someone holding a handgun, with the 
caption: "When the founders of the United States of America wrote the 2nd 
Amendment . . . this is not what they had in mind." Rather, the brochure says, 
the Constitution's authors wanted to "guarantee that states could maintain 
armed forces to resist the federal government. Most scholars overwhelmingly 
concur that the 2nd Amendment was never intended to guarantee gun ownership 
rights for individual personal use. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Gardiner, a National Rifle Assn. attorney, scoffed at such statements. 
"I'm stunned the ACLU would reach that conclusion," he said. "They obviously 
didn't read anything." 
</P>
<P>
 Ronald Garet, a professor of law and religion at USC, said there was "some 
interesting scholarship . . . suggesting kind of a middle ground." 
</P>
<P>
 The nation's founders envisioned that state militias -- dependent on 
arms-bearing citizens -- would fight the country's battles rather than a 
federal army. So the amendment involves a right to bear arms, but the right is 
tied to the maintenance of a state militia -- not to hunting or protecting 
yourself against criminals, Garet said.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES COUNTY; 
AGREEMENT PAVES WAY FOR ART MUSEUM EXPANSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors has given final approval to a new 
99-year contract that will allow for a major expansion of the Los Angeles 
County Museum of Art. 
</P>
<P>
 "This agreement restores a measure of stability to museum funding and paves 
the way for substantial improvements in programs and operations," Supervisor Ed 
Edelman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement with the nonprofit Museum Associates, which manages the 
facility, would make possible the long-awaited purchase of the vacant May Co. 
facility next to the museum complex on Wilshire Boulevard. The $25-million 
purchase and renovation project would allow the museum to expand and act as a 
hub to attract other cultural organizations, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the agreement, the county would provide an annual base amount of $14.2 
million, which could increase under certain escalator clauses related to 
increased costs of labor and supplies. The Museum Associates would be required 
to provide a contribution equal to 80% of the county's funding.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: URBAN ANGLERS CATCH A 
TASTE OF THE WILD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Thousands of jostling fishermen waited with their hooks in the water as a 
fleet of trucks dumped a million trophy-sized High Sierra trout into dozens of 
inner-city park lakes Wednesday in a first-ever attempt to give city dwellers a 
mountain fishing experience. 
</P>
<P>
 Wait a second. You're right: Fish stories always tend to be exaggerated. So 
let's have the truth this time. 
</P>
<P>
 About 50 fishermen stood back and watched quietly Wednesday as a lone tank 
truck from a Fillmore fish hatchery delivered 1,700 small trout to three 
neighborhood park lakes in an expansion of a popular urban Los Angeles fishing 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 Rainbow trout will be planted at five more parks today and next week, state 
Department of Fish and Game officials said. After that, the trout supply will 
be replenished at all eight lakes every other week through the early spring. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to increase the fishing experience in the urban community," Fish and 
Game spokesman Patrick Moore explained. "Fishable waters are no longer around 
and available like they used to be. A lot of people are not able to drive a few 
hours to get to lakes and streams out of town." 
</P>
<P>
 A few Los Angeles-area lakes have been stocked for decades with catfish and 
bass. Trout planting was tried on an experimental basis last year at Echo Park 
Lake near downtown Los Angeles, Balboa Lake in Van Nuys and Alondra Park Lake 
in Lawndale. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of its popularity, lakes at Kenneth Hahn Park, Lincoln Park, Cerritos 
Park, La Mirada Park and Willowbrook Park were added to the trout list this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike mountain stream trout plantings done in secret to prevent overfishing, 
the urban deliveries are publicized. That meant that small crowds of fishermen 
at Hahn, Alondra and Willowbrook parks were waiting as Fish and Game workers 
Kevin Ceccato and Ken Robledo scooped nets full of flopping, half-pound 
rainbows into the lakes. The pair are scheduled to stock lakes at Echo Park, 
Lincoln Park, Cerritos Park and La Mirada Park today and Balboa Lake next week. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always keep my rod and reel in my car," said George Purnell, a 58-year-old 
safe maintenance technician from South-Central Los Angeles as he waited for 
fish to arrive at Alondra Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Lawndale school maintenance worker Oscar Morales, 40: "This is good for 
us little people who can't go to the mountains every week." 
</P>
<P>
 Fishery biologist Diego Busatto said water quality at the eight city lakes 
will be checked three times a week. Scientists want to make certain that levels 
of such substances as chlorine and copper are low -- and that oxygen levels are 
high. Trout will not be planted in water warmer than 75 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
 At the 61-degree Willowbrook Park lake, Robert Davis, a 54-year-old disabled 
diesel mechanic from Carson, was waiting for a nibble from the 520 trout 
planted there. "You gotta have patience with trout," he sighed. 
</P>
<P>
 But across the lake, Nate Gibson, 59, a freight handler from South-Central Los 
Angeles, was almost too busy to talk. The trout truck wasn't out of the park 
yet. But he had already reeled in four rainbows. 
</P>
<P>
 And that's no fish tale. BOB POOL

PLEA DEAL IN MCA SHOOTINGS; COURTS: EX-WORKER ADMITS TO FIRING THREE DOZEN 
ROUNDS AT CORPORATE HEADQUARTERS, WOUNDING SEVEN PEOPLE. HE IS LIKELY TO GET A 
10-YEAR TERM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A disgruntled former employee pleaded guilty Wednesday to shooting into the 
MCA world headquarters in Universal City last April, firing three dozen rounds 
and injuring seven workers. With his trial scheduled to start Wednesday, John 
Brian Jarvis, 58, struck a last-minute deal with prosecutors and pleaded guilty 
to seven counts of assault with a deadly weapon and two counts of discharging a 
firearm into an occupied building. 
</P>
<P>
 Jarvis, who originally pleaded not guilty to 16 felony charges, had faced a 
maximum sentence of 20 years in prison. When he is sentenced March 8, he is 
expected to receive a 10-year prison sentence under terms of the plea 
agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 "He engaged in a practice, which he should have known would put people at risk 
for their lives so he will spend 10 years in prison," Deputy Dist. Atty. David 
P. Conn said. 
</P>
<P>
 Conn described the agreement as fair, noting that Jarvis lacked the intent to 
kill. 
</P>
<P>
 "He simply wanted to retaliate against MCA for some perceived injury against 
him over the years," Conn said. 
</P>
<P>
 Stephen Galindo, the public defender representing Jarvis, also said the 
agreement was equitable. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was facing quite a bit of time, and even though we felt we had some legal 
defenses, my experience is that oftentimes jurors tend to vote with their 
emotions rather than their logic," Galindo said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Galindo, however, maintained that the entertainment conglomerate had 
mistreated Jarvis. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's clear that MCA did treat him very unfairly by causing him to be 
blacklisted," Galindo said. "He was unable to work for several years, which 
culminated with the death of his mother causing him to snap and freak out." 
</P>
<P>
 An MCA representative could not be reached for comment Wednesday, but company 
officials had previously said the allegations were untrue. 
</P>
<P>
 Jarvis positioned himself on Bluffside Drive and peppered MCA's headquarters 
and a neighboring Bank of America building with three dozen rounds from a 
high-powered 7-millimeter rifle. He then calmly surrendered to police. 
</P>
<P>
 The bullets wounded two women. Five other people were injured by flying shards 
of glass and metal. 
</P>
<P>
 "I did what I had to do," Jarvis said in an interview in June. 
</P>
<P>
 Jarvis later told police that MCA, where he had once worked as a movie studio 
driver, had blackballed him, causing his chronic unemployment.

MASSIVE CLEANUP FROM STORM DAMAGE CONTINUES; MUDSLIDES: MALIBU OFFICIALS 
ANNOUNCE PLANS TO OFFER CITY AID AND HIRE TEMPORARY LABORERS TO ASSIST 
RESIDENTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The coast highway reopened, the broken water main was patched and the homes 
were returned to some semblance of order Wednesday as the people of Malibu and 
the work crews who helped them continued the massive task of cleaning up 
mudslides that invaded the beachfront city. 
</P>
<P>
 Cleanup efforts also continued in Altadena and in Cherry Valley, two other 
communities hit by mudslides when Monday's heavy rains stripped soil from 
hillsides denuded in last fall's brush fires. 
</P>
<P>
 Cheered by a second day of perfect beach weather and an outpouring of 
neighborly support, Malibu residents worked shoulder-to-shoulder with crews 
from the state, county and city on Wednesday, and the results were heartening. 
</P>
<P>
 Traffic flowed along Pacific Coast Highway again after two days of 
around-the-clock labor to clear it of mud, rocks and water. Workers restored a 
water main that broke when the earth gave way in Las Flores Canyon, cutting off 
water service to many homes and adding to the flood. Families finally scraped 
away enough clotted sludge to find floors, carpets and personal belongings 
buried two days earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials announced plans to hire temporary laborers to help residents 
clean up, and city staffers handed out flyers offering city aid to victims of 
Monday's deluge. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the demand for sandbags ebbed with the floodwaters, officials advised 
residents to stock up for the next rainfall -- due in as early as Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 The two dozen homeowners who suffered the worst flooding needed no reminders. 
</P>
<P>
 A backhoe scooped what was left of three feet of mud from the garage of Randy 
Brant's seaside home on PCH near Big Rock Canyon on Wednesday. Nearby, a pile 
of mud-covered debris -- including a television and large boom box -- grew to 
four feet high. 
</P>
<P>
 Drinking a Diet Coke and thanking neighbors who helped him dig out, Brant 
slogged through the muck in rubber boots and shorts, his exposed legs gray from 
caked mud. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't talk to each other that much during the course of the year, but it's 
neat how everyone works together during a disaster," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Brant, a real estate developer, planted an "Open House" sign in front of the 
mess and, before the coast highway reopened, fashioned a mud tee and drove a 
golf ball down the middle of the road. 
</P>
<P>
 "It hit at 225 (yards) and probably went 390 -- John Daly beware," he said, 
referring to the golfer. "I'm just trying to have fun." 
</P>
<P>
 But what bothered him, Brant said, was that Caltrans first refused to scoop up 
the mud that flooded his and neighbors' garages and then made their cleanup 
more difficult by reopening the highway. 
</P>
<P>
 The newly opened highway brought the first wave of sightseers. 
</P>
<P>
 Lyle Kaufman, a vacationer from New Hampshire, could hardly believe his luck 
as he videotaped the Brant cleanup -- his second videotaped disaster since 
arriving here in December. 
</P>
<P>
 Kaufman said he had gone on the earthquake ride at Universal Studios the day 
before the real thing shattered the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been one thing after another," he said "I've got about 12 hours of 
video. 
</P>
<P>
 He lowered his voice: "I shouldn't be excited about it, but I am." 
</P>
<P>
 At Cosentino's, a nursery that had been covered with mud at the base of Las 
Flores Canyon, life was getting back to normal -- just in time for the busy 
Valentine's Day trade. 
</P>
<P>
 At midmorning, it was virtually the only store open along the closed section 
of the coast highway. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you open the door, you get business," said owner Jo Cosentino, as she 
bustled to fill a bouquet order. "We're tough." 
</P>
<P>
 A short way up Las Flores Canyon Road, tractors scooped up the remaining inch 
of mud. Pepperdine University senior Greg Vernovage, who had watched his 
back-yard creek swell to the top of its banks, was relieved that the apartment 
he shares with two roommates survived again. 
</P>
<P>
 "We made it through the fire. We made through the earthquake. We made it 
through the rain," he said. "The shack stands." 
</P>
<P>
 In Altadena, where about half a dozen homes suffered relatively minor damage, 
most of the major cleanup efforts were largely completed by Wednesday 
afternoon, and traffic was again moving along a street buried when a sandbag 
barrier gave way Monday night under a torrent of muddy water. 
</P>
<P>
 In Cherry Valley, a foothill community in western Riverside County, residents 
of the Highland Springs Village mobile home park finished scraping the mud from 
their yards and driveways. Further damage had been avoided when firefighters 
built a sandbag barrier that diverted much of the runoff into a creek bed. 
</P>
<P>
 Bruce Thoren, a meteorologist with WeatherData Inc., said skies should be 
mostly sunny in southern California for the next few days, except for a few 
scattered clouds along the coast. 
</P>
<P>
 "Along about Sunday night, early Monday morning, there's a chance of some more 
rain," he said. "The way things look right now, L.A. probably will see only a 
few showers, if that. Right now, it doesn't look like a big rain event."

 * I am a high school senior, and with my parents I am facing the difficult 
task of financing my college education. 
</P>
<P>
 Private schools are now so costly that I am looking toward the public 
University of California system for my higher education. 
</P>
<P>
 But, even as you read this letter, Gov. Pete Wilson is discussing raising 
tuition at the UC and Cal State systems. Even California's community colleges 
will feel the pressure. 
</P>
<P>
 That is why I must respond to your article "Cal State Panel OKs 8.6% Raise for 
Presidents," (Jan. 26). 
</P>
<P>
 How can they justify raising their own salaries over $10,000 a year when 
hundreds of college students will need to claw and scratch their way to earn 
enough money to pay for college? 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone who makes over $100,000 a year is financially secure, and during a 
recession should not make their lives more luxurious at the expense of others. 
Even my own parents' combined salary is only $70,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 (UC trustee) William Hauck was right when he warned this act could "send the 
wrong message." It does!

NICKLAUS RETURNS TO RIVIERA; GOLF: HE HAS NEVER WON ON THE COURSE, BUT HE WILL 
BE IN SPOTLIGHT AS L.A. OPEN BEGINS TODAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRED ROBLEDO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Jack Nicklaus is still The Man at Riviera Country Club. 
</P>
<P>
 It was obvious from the time he stepped out of the clubhouse to make his way 
down the hill to the driving range. Autograph seekers shoved pens and scraps of 
paper at him and cameras snapped at every turn as longtime golf fans welcomed 
him back to Riviera. 
</P>
<P>
 Fred Couples, Tom Kite, Tom Watson, Payne Stewart and U.S. Open champion Lee 
Janzen are among the favorites in the 144-man field of the $1-million Nissan 
Los Angeles Open that starts today. 
</P>
<P>
 But Nicklaus will get most of the gallery's attention when he tees off at 
11:47 a.m., making his 11th appearance in the tournament but first since 1985. 
</P>
<P>
 He won't come out and say this will be his last time in the L.A. Open, nor 
will he make any promises about playing in it again after this week. 
</P>
<P>
 When pressed, Nicklaus, who celebrated his 54th birthday last month and has 
been playing professional golf since 1962, says he doesn't even know for sure 
how much longer he'll continue to play. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, I will always play in some senior major events because I think the tour 
needs my support," he said Wednesday, "but when I talk about playing some more, 
I'm talking about the regular tour. That's the only one that really matters to 
me." 
</P>
<P>
 And when he's talking about the regular tour, he is really talking about the 
major championships, because that is what Jack Nicklaus is all about. 
</P>
<P>
 Nicklaus has won 18 of them, 20 when two U.S. Amateurs are included, but none 
since the Masters in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 "The majors have always been my top priority," he said. "They always will be. 
I can't change that. That's just me. I will never be a player who accepts an 
invitation to play in a major just to play in it. If I don't believe that I can 
compete, then there's no sense in playing." 
</P>
<P>
 Nicklaus, who is making his third tournament appearance this year, said he is 
trying to get his game ready for the majors by playing in more early-season 
events. 
</P>
<P>
 He was encouraged by his play when he won the Seniors Mercedes Championship at 
La Costa, but he missed the cut last week at Pebble Beach, where he shot rounds 
of 74, 73 and 73. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't play very well," he said, "but it was expected. It was just a little 
bump in the road. I'm not going to know how well I can play unless I play in a 
lot of tournaments. The way I play in these tournaments, and in the majors this 
year, will tell me if it's worth it to keep playing." 
</P>
<P>
 Nicklaus entered 10 PGA Tour events and six senior tour tournaments last year. 
He had three top-10 finishes on the senior side, but only one -- a 10th at 
Doral -- on the regular tour. 
</P>
<P>
 That's not a bad record, but below the standard Nicklaus expects of himself. 
</P>
<P>
 His sights have always been set high, beginning with his U.S. Amateur 
victories in 1959 and '61. 
</P>
<P>
 His first pro victory came in a major, the 1962 U.S. Open at Oakmont Country 
Club in Pennsylvania. 
</P>
<P>
 Nicklaus' first tournament at Riviera was in 1973 when he finished sixth at 
280, four shots behind Rod Funseth. It was to be the first of his many 
frustrating experiences at Riviera. 
</P>
<P>
 He often played well enough to contend, but there was always somebody having a 
better week. 
</P>
<P>
 Pat Fitzsimons won the only tournament of his life at Riviera in 1975, beating 
runner-up Tom Kite by four shots and Nicklaus by five. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Gil Morgan's year to shine in 1978. Nicklaus shared the lead with four 
holes to play, but double-bogeyed the 15th and bogeyed the 16th. Morgan beat 
him by two strokes. 
</P>
<P>
 The only other time he had a chance to win the L.A. Open was in 1984, but 
David Edwards shot a 64 on the final day to defeat Jack Renner by three and 
Nicklaus by four. 
</P>
<P>
 And Nicklaus was runner-up to Hal Sutton in the 1983 PGA Championship at 
Riviera. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's been typical of the way things have always been for me at Riviera," 
Nicklaus said. "I've had some pretty good rounds here, but never four that were 
good enough to win." 
</P>
<P>
 Although he isn't among the favorites this week, Nicklaus knows what can 
happen if he should get into contention early. "I think I still know what to do 
if I get in that position," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, if 46-year-old Johnny Miller can win at Pebble Beach without 
practicing, it shouldn't be that much of a shock if golf's all-time greatest 
player comes through for the first time on one of golf's greatest courses. 
</P>
<P>
 Golf Notes 
</P>
<P>
 The pros are still talking about Johnny Miller's victory last week at Pebble 
Beach. "It was unbelievable," said Fred Couples, a two-time winner at Riviera. 
"I can't imagine anybody winning without playing for a year. If I came into 
this event after taking a year off, I would have an airplane reservation for 
Friday night. You know, that just shows you what a great player he really was. 
He could always hit the ball better than anybody else. And I don't care what he 
says, he must be able to putt. But I know he has had some bad knees and there 
have been times when he just couldn't play, period." 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Kite said: "I think it's ironic that Johnny Miller won, because he's been 
up in that ivory tower (on TV) telling everybody that you can't win after 40. 
He probably surprised himself that he had a pulse. I didn't get to watch him 
because I was playing with runner-up (Tom) Watson, but Miller had to be playing 
well because Watson was hitting every shot solid."

HARDING SUES USOC; FIGURE SKATING: $20-MILLION SUIT FILED IN OREGON SAYS SHE 
SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO COMPETE IN LILLEHAMMER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Tonya Harding sued the U.S. Olympic Committee for $20 million Wednesday to 
block any attempt to keep her from skating at the Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit, filed in Clackamas County Circuit Court in Oregon, contends that 
Harding has complied with all rules and regulations of the U.S. Figure Skating 
Assn. and should be allowed to compete. 
</P>
<P>
 The USOC has scheduled a hearing for Tuesday to determine whether Harding's 
role in the attack on rival skater Nancy Kerrigan violated Olympic ethics. The 
hearing could get her thrown off the team. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit, which seeks $20 million in punitive damages, says people close to 
Harding have been charged with conspiracy in the Kerrigan assault, but that no 
charges have been filed against her. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier, in a television interview, Harding vowed she would go to the 
Olympics, win a gold medal and "hang it on my wall forever." 
</P>
<P>
 She also said that if given the chance, she would give Kerrigan a hug, "if 
she'll let me." 
</P>
<P>
 Accompanying his client as she left a TV taping in Portland, Ore., attorney 
Bob Weaver had said he would issue a statement soon as to whether she would 
appear before the USOC's Games Administrative Board. 
</P>
<P>
 The USOC was notified Tuesday by Harding's ex-husband, Jeff Gillooly, that he 
was willing to testify before the board provided he received permission from 
the Multnomah County (Ore.) district attorney to travel as well as expenses and 
legal fees. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee, through attorney Peter Alkalay, requested that Gillooly be made 
available to testify before the board. The request was made in a letter sent 
Tuesday to Gillooly's attorney, Ron Hoevet. 
</P>
<P>
 Gillooly pleaded guilty to a charge of racketeering in connection with the 
Kerrigan attack and implicated Harding as one of the plotters. He has agreed to 
serve two years in prison and pay a $100,000 fine as part of a plea bargain. 
</P>
<P>
 Gillooly also asked that the results of a lie-detector test he took be made 
public and given to the USOC. 
</P>
<P>
 A hearing on Gillooly's request was set for today. Multnomah County District 
Attorney Michael Schrunk said, "I can't imagine" opposing the motion. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview with "Inside Edition" set for broadcast today and Friday, 
Harding said: "I'm going to the Olympics. I'm going to win a gold medal. And, 
I'm going to hang it on my wall forever." 
</P>
<P>
 She also said that given the chance, she would apologize to Kerrigan. "I'll 
tell her that I'm really sorry that this has happened and that I always wish 
her the best and, hopefully, she'll forgive me for all this crap that's going 
on. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe (I'll) give her a hug. If she'll let me." 
</P>
<P>
 Harding said winning a gold medal was important to her for reasons other than 
money. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it all ended tomorrow and I had a gold medal in my hand with the people 
I'm surrounded with now, my life would be complete." 
</P>
<P>
 After avoiding comment for days, Harding also was interviewed for "Eye to Eye 
With Connie Chung," set for broadcast tonight. She maintained her innocence and 
said she no longer loved Gillooly, because "if somebody loved me, they wouldn't 
do this to me." 
</P>
<P>
 She also said: "I can't let this ruin me. I've worked too hard, too long, 20 
years." 
</P>
<P>
 Harding, the 23-year-old U.S. figure skating champion, was still scheduled to 
arrive in Norway next Wednesday, the day after the hearing is to begin. 
</P>
<P>
 Her absence probably would not change the USOC's plans, Executive Director 
Harvey Schiller said, but it might not help her cause. 
</P>
<P>
 "My expectation would be that the board would consider all the information 
they have . . . in light of her non-appearance," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Harding's reluctance to appear before the USOC hearing could stem from the 
fact that any testimony could be used against her in the criminal investigation 
still under way in Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
 Schiller said Gillooly was one of several prospective witnesses contacted by 
the USOC about their availability to testify in Oslo. He stressed that it was 
not certain Gillooly would be called. 
</P>
<P>
 "The burden of proof is on the USOC, not on Miss Harding," Schiller said. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier, he said Harding's attorney had not given the USOC a specific date for 
her arrival. One thing is certain -- Harding will not be on hand for the parade 
of athletes at Saturday's opening ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's not unusual," Schiller said. "At previous Olympic Games, figure 
skaters as well as other athletes, for a variety of reasons, have arrived later 
than opening ceremonies." 
</P>
<P>
 Women's figure skating begins Feb. 23, two days after the deadline for 
finalizing the lineup. The USOC hearing could determine if 13-year-old Michelle 
Kwan of Torrance, the top alternate, gets to skate on Olympic ice. 
</P>
<P>
 Kerrigan, granted a spot on the team even though her knee injury prevented her 
from competing in the U.S. trials, left Boston for the Olympics on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Schiller said the committee was ready for anything. 
</P>
<P>
 "The USOC, like any other organization, considers the liability issues when it 
holds a board hearing," he said. "We will protect our position in every way 
possible." 
</P>
<P>
 The cost for the hearing and related activities is already $200,000, he said, 
and the 11-member board had not yet decided whether to pick up the tab for 
Harding's lawyers and associates to attend. The USOC said if Gillooly is called 
to testify, it will pay travel expenses for him and his lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
 The hearing will focus on seven accusations laid out in a five-page USOC 
memorandum sent to Harding's attorneys Monday night. The allegations concern 
her conduct in relation to the ethics codes of the USOC, the International 
Olympic Committee and the U.S. Figure Skating Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Schiller and other Olympic officials have repeatedly cited Harding's Jan. 27 
statement that she learned of the plot to attack Kerrigan after the fact and 
then withheld the information from police for more than a week.

<P>
 Bob (Horse) Reynolds, a former executive for the Angels and Rams, has died. He 
was 79. 
</P>
<P>
 Reynolds died Tuesday at his home in San Rafael, according to Stanford 
University. 
</P>
<P>
 Reynolds, who played football at Stanford and with the Detroit Lions, founded 
Golden West Broadcasters with Gene Autry in 1952. The independent broadcasting 
group included such stations as KSFO radio in San Francisco and KTLA television 
in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Reynolds and Autry subsequently formed the Golden West Baseball Company, which 
owned the Angels. Reynolds was president of the Angels from 1961-75. He was 
vice president and director of the Rams from 1963-72. 
</P>
<P>
 Reynolds also was a member of the Board of Regents of the University of 
California for 16 years and was a member of the 1984 Los Angeles Olympic 
Organizing Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 A 6-foot-4, 225-pound tackle, he played at Stanford from 1933-36. In three 
Rose Bowl games, Reynolds set a Rose Bowl record by playing every minute of 
each game on both sides of the ball. 
</P>
<P>
 Reynolds, who played two seasons with the Lions, was elected to the National 
Football Foundation College Hall of Fame in 1961. 
</P>
<P>
 Reynolds is survived by his wife, Elizabeth, three sons, a sister and 11 
grandchildren. Arrangements for a Feb. 27 memorial service in Los Angeles were 
pending.

 Be Welcome, a 5-year-old Albatross offspring whose 2-, 3- and 4-year-old 
seasons all ended in leg injuries after one race, will be a big favorite 
tonight at Los Alamitos in the 10th race, second elimination of the Anaheim 
Pacing Series. 
</P>
<P>
 After finishing eighth in a nine-horse field on Jan. 8 to open his 5-year-old 
season, Be Welcome has won three of four starts, with a career-best winning 
mile time of 1:56 3/5 Saturday night.In the fourth, on Jan. 29, he finished 
third to You Better Bet, a 5-year-old with $200,000 in winnings in his career. 
</P>
<P>
 The Anaheim Pacing Series is the first of several events designed to give 
horses who are not in the top class a chance to race for bigger purses. It is a 
restricted event for colts and geldings who had not won three races and earned 
more than $5,000 -- $7,500 for California breds -- as of Dec. 31. 
</P>
<P>
 Maxanali, a 3-year-old who will be one of the leading contenders in the first 
division, the seventh race, ended '93 with two victories but had earned more 
than $18,000. Since then, he has won two races and added more than $12,000 to 
his bankroll. 
</P>
<P>
 The first four finishers in each division and the fifth-place horse with the 
faster time will qualify for the final next Thursday. STEVE ANDERSEN

LITTLE GOES A LONG WAY FOR CLU; COLLEGE BASKETBALL: ULLOA, SMALLEST PLAYER ON 
COURT, IGNITES SECOND-HALF SPURT AS KINGSMEN CRUISE PAST REDLANDS, 117-92.

 Dave Ulloa of Cal Lutheran was the smallest player on the court in Wednesday 
night's Southern California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference men's 
basketball game against visiting Redlands, but no one stood out more than the 
diminutive sophomore during a scintillating 46-second stretch early in the 
second half. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal Lutheran had a 12-point lead when Ulloa went on a tear that sent the 
Kingsmen on their way to a 117-92 victory which was not as close as the final 
score. 
</P>
<P>
 Keith Morgan of Redlands had hit a pair of free throws with 15 minutes 47 
seconds left in the game to narrow the Bulldogs' deficit to 64-52 when Ulloa 
went to work. 
</P>
<P>
 His 12-foot jump shot gave Cal Lutheran a 14-point lead with 15:33 remaining, 
and he added a 10-footer from the right side 10 seconds later after stealing 
the inbounds pass. 
</P>
<P>
 The 5-foot-9 guard from Glendale High stole yet another inbounds pass and 
fired a wraparound pass to Rupert Sapwell who scored on a layup, was fouled, 
and converted the free throw to give the Kingsmen a 71-52 lead with 15:13 left. 
</P>
<P>
 Redlands Coach Gary Smith called time out to slow Cal Lutheran down, but 
Ulloa's three-point shot with 14:47 to go got the Kingsmen rolling again as 
they scored 12 points on their next five possessions to take an 83-52 lead with 
12:51 left. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, Cal Lutheran (19-1, 8-1 in the conference) outscored Redlands, 19-0, 
over a stretch of less than three minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Coach is always telling us that defense makes our offense go and that was 
sure true tonight," Ulloa said. "We got a couple of easy baskets off those 
steals which kind of broke their backs." 
</P>
<P>
 Ulloa had been held to 13 points and five assists in the previous two games, 
but he had 21 points, six assists and four steals on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Coach told me a couple of weeks ago to feel free to take control of the game 
and play with a little more aggression," Ulloa said. "And that's helped me to 
relax. Tonight I played more like I played in high school, with more freedom to 
do as I like." 
</P>
<P>
 Cal Lutheran, tied for first with Pomona-Pitzer in the SCIAC standings, 
extended its lead to 104-69 before Mike Dunlap cleared his bench with 5:53 
left. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think giving some of our guys a rest in the first half really helped in the 
second half," Dunlap said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were able to get after Redlands and apply pressure." 
</P>
<P>
 Redlands (9-11, 4-5) turned the ball over 32 times as the Kingsmen had a 
season-high 22 steals. 
</P>
<P>
 Sapwell added 21 points and seven rebounds for Cal Lutheran, which has won 
four games in a row since being upset by Claremont-Mudd two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal Lutheran led, 53-42, at halftime after going on a 17-6 run over the last 4 
1/2 minutes of the first 20-minute period. 
</P>
<P>
 Redland's David Cottey hit a three-point shot to tie the score, 36-36, with 
4:52 left in the half, but the Kingsmen took charge after that by forcing the 
Bulldogs into five turnovers on their final 10 possessions before intermission. 
</P>
<P>
 Sapwell (12 points and six rebounds) got the Cal Lutheran run going with a 
put-back of a missed shot by Damon Ridley and Ulloa capped it with a weaving 
drive through the left side of the lane four seconds before halftime. 
</P>
<P>
 Ulloa scored six points during the Kingsmen's run on three-of-three shooting 
from the field. He had 11 points at halftime with teammate Jason Smith adding 
nine. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Anderson had a team-high 10 points for Redlands.

GLENDALE FINISHED BY FAST START; COLLEGE BASKETBALL: CANYONS JUMPS AHEAD EARLY 
AND STAYS THERE TO REMAIN IN FIRST PLACE WITH 93-62 VICTORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 So many things went right for College of the Canyons and so many things went 
wrong for Glendale in their Western State Conference South Division basketball 
game Wednesday night that it's hard to pinpoint when the dismantling started. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, how about the beginning? 
</P>
<P>
 The Cougars (12-15, 6-1 in conference play) dominated from the tipoff in a 
93-62 victory over Glendale to increase their winning streak to six games and 
remain in first place in the division. 
</P>
<P>
 For Canyons, which lost five games in a row before catching fire, the winning 
streak couldn't have come at a better time. The Cougars lead Bakersfield 
(12-16, 5-1 after Wednesday night's victory over Valley) by a half-game heading 
into a showdown with the Renegades on Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 "The guys think they can win (the division title) and I'm not going to 
discourage that," Canyons Coach Lee Smelser said. "We are getting a lot of 
confidence." 
</P>
<P>
 It showed against the Vaqueros (13-3, 4-3). 
</P>
<P>
 Canyons consistently beat Glendale down the court for easy shots underneath 
the basket and played aggressive defense, forcing the Vaqueros into 21 
turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got our (butts) kicked in every phase of the game and we accepted it," 
Glendale Coach Brian Beauchemin said. "Maybe we like it. I don't know. It's 
inexcusable at this point of the season." 
</P>
<P>
 The Cougars jumped to a 25-9 lead with 8 minutes 4 seconds to play in the 
first half and coasted from there. They led at halftime, 36-23. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the scoring damage by the Cougars in the half was done by sophomore 
guard Randy Eason, who pumped in 12 of his game-high 21 points in the first 20 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Eason got help from guard Alric Gillett (18 points in the game) and center 
Kwesi' Fulton (11 points), who each scored seven points before intermission. 
</P>
<P>
 Glendale, on the other hand, got points in the half from only three players 
and made only 10 of 33 shots (30.3%). 
</P>
<P>
 Center Charles Garcia scored 14 points and guards Michael Wright (five points) 
and Ryan Asplund (four points) had the remaining points for Glendale in the 
first half. Garcia finished with 20 points for the Vaqueros. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought we were a step quicker and I think our defense upset their 
offense," Smelser said. "When they weren't real fluid in their offense, they 
took some bad shots." 
</P>
<P>
 The Vaqueros looked just as bad in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 Canyons opened the half with an 8-0 run for a 44-23 advantage with 18:26 left 
to play behind two baskets each from Eason and Gillett. 
</P>
<P>
 From there, it was simply a matter of Canyons running out the clock. The 
Cougars used all 13 players on their roster and 11 of them scored. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was typical of our inconsistency all year," Beauchemin said. "You can't 
play good one game and crappy the next game. . . . We were prepared but there 
was no application to our preparation."

IN LONG RUN, CHATSWORTH NOT SO SHORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Marcel Wilson played perhaps his best game Wednesday. His front-court pal, 
Tarik Hill, kept up his end of the bargain too. 
</P>
<P>
 Good thing, because Chatsworth High is suddenly running low on players. 
</P>
<P>
 If not us, who? 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't have many guys left," Wilson said. "We're down to basically our 
starting five." 
</P>
<P>
 But a high five they are. Despite losing three players in the past week to 
academic ineligibility, Chatsworth showed it is still the class of the North 
Valley League by downing Cleveland, 67-55, Wednesday to clinch a share of the 
league championship. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, Chatsworth lost starting swingman Trenell Floyd, the team's 
second-leading scorer. Two top reserves, sophomore forward T.J. McCoy and 
freshman guard Isaiah Thomas, were felled by the academic ax this week. 
</P>
<P>
 All of which bothered Wilson and Hill not a bit. Wilson, a senior forward, 
scored 25 points and Hill added 16 as the Chancellors (12-7, 4-1 in league 
play) ensured themselves of the league's top seeding when the playoffs begin in 
two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Chatsworth can win the title outright with a victory over last-place Kennedy 
(7-10, 2-3) on Friday. The Chancellors may be down to the few and the proud, 
but maybe there's something to be said for familiarity. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we're at our peak right now," Hill said. "I think we're ready for the 
playoffs." 
</P>
<P>
 Chatsworth was definitely ready for Cleveland, thinning ranks or not. 
Chatsworth, with 10 players in uniform, had to scramble for replacements on 
occasion. 
</P>
<P>
 Sophomore center Eddie Miller, who scored 10 points, suffered a cut on his 
right arm in the third quarter and was automatically removed because he was 
bleeding. Chatsworth didn't have any bandages at courtside, so seldom-used 
Alvaro Camas had to fill in for Miller and made one of two free throws. 
</P>
<P>
 Free throws were definitely Cleveland's undoing. The Cavaliers, who spotted 
Chatsworth a 15-4 lead in the first quarter, nonetheless stayed within striking 
range into the fourth quarter. With Chatsworth holding a 61-51 lead with 1 
minute 42 seconds remaining, Hill fouled out. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Louis Fernandez, who scored 16 points, missed two free throws and it 
got only worse. Cleveland (12-7, 3-2) missed its last five free throws, 
including an airball by Edtwaun Adams with 1:21 left. In all, the Cavaliers 
made six of 16 at the line. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was getting a little close down the stretch," Hill said. "I was getting 
kind of nervous." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson, however, already had given Chatsworth a commanding lead with a 
superlative third quarter. The transfer from Granada Hills scored 14 points in 
the quarter, two fewer than Cleveland.

NHL ROUNDUP; LOSS ENDS RANGERS' LONG DAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A long day on the road, a long night at the rink and another loss left the New 
York Rangers frustrated. 
</P>
<P>
 Eric Desjardins scored 1:27 into overtime and the Montreal Canadiens defeated 
the Rangers, 4-3, Wednesday night for their sixth victory in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 Because a blizzard in New York closed the airports, the Rangers rode a bus to 
Montreal. The trip took eight hours or, as defenseman Doug Lidster described, 
"three and half movies, a McDonald's and a Boston Chicken." 
</P>
<P>
 Montreal used power-play goals from Mathieu Schneider and Gilbert Dionne late 
in the second period to erase a 3-1 deficit and set up the overtime, which 
seemed to make a bad day complete. 
</P>
<P>
 Dallas 4, Winnipeg 2 -- Mike Modano scored the go-ahead goal at 6:02 of the 
third period at Dallas, where the Stars extended Winnipeg's winless streak to 
11 games (0-9-2). 
</P>
<P>
 Modano's 32nd goal of the season gave the Stars a 2-1 lead and sent them to 
their fifth victory in six games. 
</P>
<P>
 Calgary 6, Edmonton 1 -- Robert Reichel scored two goals at Edmonton and the 
Flames won their fourth in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 Reichel has 14 goals in his last 12 games, and 27 for the season. 
</P>
<P>
 The Flames built a 5-0 lead, scoring three consecutive power-play goals.

NEWSWIRE: SOONER GREAT WILKINSON DEAD AT 77 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
From Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bud Wilkinson, who won three national championships at Oklahoma and coached 
the Sooners to an NCAA-record 47 straight victories, died late Wednesday night 
in St. Louis after a long illness. He was 77. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilkinson, a member of the National Football Coaches Hall of Fame, had been in 
a St. Louis hospital for an extended period of time before returning home this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilkinson compiled a record of 145-29-4 in 17 seasons at Oklahoma. He won one 
Big Six title, a dozen Big Seven championships and one Big Eight championship. 
He later coached the St. Louis Cardinals in the NFL and became a broadcaster 
for ABC and ESPN. 
</P>
<P>
 The football dormitory at Oklahoma is named for Wilkinson, who earned a 
reputation for class and excellence during his career. 
</P>
<P>
 Linebacker Junior Seau of the San Diego Chargers agreed to a contract that 
makes him the NFL's second highest-paid defensive player at what sources say is 
$16.3 million over four years. Green Bay's Reggie White signed a $17-million, 
four-year deal last season. Baseball  
</P>
<P>
 The Angels have invited minor league left-hander Andrew Lorraine to their 
spring-training camp, after learning that starter Joe Magrane will be sidelined 
at least two months while recovering from arthroscopic elbow surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels also promoted Bob Fontaine to Angel assistant vice president for 
scouting and player personnel. Fontaine, 40, has been Angel scouting director 
since 1986.

RECRUITING / JEFF FELLENZER: ROBINSON HITS ROAD, USC GOES FIRST CLASS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF FELLENZER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Soon after USC finished recruiting last year, and after assessing the talent 
he inherited from Larry Smith as he embarked on his second tour of duty at the 
school, football Coach John Robinson told his staff: "We need to have a 
top-five recruiting class next year." 
</P>
<P>
 The hard work began at the top. Robinson hit the road for a week in May, 
highly unusual for a head coach, so he could personally evaluate some of the 
top prospects in the state. Among the players he watched practice were 
defensive linemen Darrell Russell of San Diego St. Augustine and George Perry 
of San Bernardino, running back Rodney Sermons of La Puente Bishop Amat and 
wide receiver Larry Parker of Bakersfield. 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson continued to actively recruit during the season. One day after 
practice in November, he flew to San Diego to watch Russell play in a game that 
night. 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson set his sights on the best players available, and also hoped to 
re-establish the Trojans' national recruiting presence. Now, a year later, 
Robinson's recruiting class is receiving widespread acclaim as one of the best 
in the country. Among his most heralded signees are none other than Russell, 
Perry, Sermons and Parker. 
</P>
<P>
 One publication ranked USC's class No. 1 nationally, another had it No. 2 and 
most others put it in the top five. 
</P>
<P>
 This year's Trojan recruiting class includes several players who have not yet 
qualified academically, but who USC coaches and academic counselors believe 
were "good risks" to sign conditionally: top running back prospects Delon 
Washington of Dallas and Marlin Carey of San Diego Mt. Carmel, defensive back 
Ken Haslip of Pasadena Muir and defensive lineman Antoine Simpson of La Porte, 
Tex. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoping for some immediate help, USC signed 10 junior college players out of 
its class of 29, and added sophomore quarterback Bob Otten (6-6, 215), a 
transfer from Weber State. Best of the bunch appears to be wide receiver 
Keyshawn Johnson (6-4, 205) of West L.A. College, cornerback Mario Bradley 
(6-2, 195) of Cerritos and inside linebacker Errick Herrin (6-2, 220) of Mt. 
San Jacinto. 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson and his staff were able to beat either or both Notre Dame and UCLA 
head-to-head for several superb high school players -- including Russell, 
Sermons, kicker Adam Abrams (5-9, 170) of La Jolla, safety Grant Pearsall (6-1, 
185) of Villa Park, tight end Rome Douglas (6-7, 245) of Claremont and 
defensive lineman Marc Matock (6-5, 235) of Salinas, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
 Notes 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA had the second-best recruiting class in the Pac-10, probably a top-10 
class nationally, and one of its best in recent years. Most talented of the new 
Bruins could be defensive lineman Vavae Tata (6-3, 240) of Honolulu St. Louis, 
described by one UCLA assistant as "a physical player in the Junior Seau mold." 
Tata and fullback Jarvis Watson (5-11, 215) of Downey Warren might play as 
freshmen. 
</P>
<P>
 Other standouts in the Bruins' class include quarterback Steve Buck (6-3, 185) 
of Alta Loma, wide receivers Tod McBride (6-2, 180) of Walnut and Jim McElroy 
(6-0, 170) of Washington High, offensive lineman Terry Williams (6-6, 270) of 
El Dorado, linebacker Danjuan Magee (6-2, 255) of Long Beach Poly and 
cornerbacks Javelin Guidry (5-10, 165) of Gahr and Akil Davis (6-0, 180) of 
Mesa, Ariz. UCLA coaches believe the "sleeper" of the class could be outside 
linebacker Ryan Neufeld (6-4, 205) of Morgan Hill, Calif. They also like Shaun 
Williams, a running back from Crespi who might be moved to the secondary. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoop report: Add Duke to the list of schools recruiting former Edison High 
star Brandon Jessie, a 6-5 forward at Ventura College who has developed into 
one of the top community college prospects in the country. Duke's top 
assistant, Mike Brey, flew to California recently to watch Jessie play. Among 
other schools recruiting Jessie include Kansas (where his father, former Ram 
wide receiver Ron Jessie, attended college), Arizona State, Washington State, 
Oklahoma and Utah.

COLLEGE NOTEBOOK: CLEARING WALL AT CSUN WILL TAKE PANES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Attention FEMA folks: You may soon be doling out money for damages inflicted 
on buildings adjacent to Cal State Northridge's baseball field. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the Northridge campus was rocked by the recent quake, and the school 
has erected several temporary classrooms in a grass field located beyond the 
right-field wall at Matador Field. The way baseballs traditionally rocket out 
of the Northridge yard, this could get ugly. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are windows facing the field," Jason Shanahan said. "We'll take care of 
those if they ever let us play at home." 
</P>
<P>
 Shanahan is one of four regulars who switch-hit or bat left-handed. Barring 
additional quake-related delays or developments, Northridge is scheduled to 
make its home debut Feb. 19 against Cal State Fullerton. CAL STATE NORTHRIDGE 
</P>
<P>
 Close Quarters 
</P>
<P>
 The gang's all here. 
</P>
<P>
 Depending on the day, that is. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of earthquake damage to the apartments and dorm rooms of several 
baseball players, one domicile has become the destination of the displaced. 
</P>
<P>
 On a given day, Chad Thornhill, Andy Shaw, Jason Van Heerde, Steve Moreno, 
Eric Gillespie, Jonathan Campbell and Shanahan can be found staying in the same 
apartment. 
</P>
<P>
 Though some players come and go -- school is not in session and some players 
periodically stay at their parents' homes -- the apartment is nonetheless 
cramped. 
</P>
<P>
 How small is it? 
</P>
<P>
 "Two bedrooms," Shanahan said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Shanahan, a junior first baseman and the team's cleanup hitter, came out of 
the Cal Poly San Luis Obispo series with four hits in 11 at-bats. Yet nobody 
had to remind him that as the No. 4 hitter and a three-year letterman, he is 
expected to drive in runs. 
</P>
<P>
 In that capacity, he didn't fare as well. All of his hits came with the bases 
empty or while leading off an inning. Overall, Shanahan came to bat with 12 
runners on base and six in scoring position. The only time he advanced a runner 
was when he was hit by a pitch. He didn't drive in a run. 
</P>
<P>
 "I took the same hitting approach (with runners on base)," he said. "That's 
baseball. It's frustrating." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Campbell's banged-up left foot wasn't feeling much better early this week, 
leaving the left fielder's availability uncertain entering games this weekend 
with UCLA and Cal State San Bernardino. 
</P>
<P>
 Campbell incurred the injury while slamming into the plywood outfield fence as 
he attempted to run down a pair of triples off the bat of San Luis Obispo 
designated hitter Rob Neal. 
</P>
<P>
 "No splinters, but I sure hurt myself," said Campbell, a junior. 
</P>
<P>
 Plywood was definitely preferable to the alternative at Northridge -- a 
cinder-block wall. 
</P>
<P>
 "At least it was wooden and not concrete," Campbell said. "It could have been 
worse." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge's 0-3 start isn't the worst in Coach Bill Kernen's six seasons at 
Northridge. In fact, the last time the Matadors stumbled out of the gate, 
things didn't turn out badly at all. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, they started 0-4 . . . then won 29 of 31 and climbed into the 
national top 10. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 What do Shaw and Angel left-hander Joe Magrane have in common? 
</P>
<P>
 Both players were operated on Tuesday by Dr. Lewis Yocum in Inglewood. 
</P>
<P>
 Shaw, a sophomore first baseman, had surgery on his left knee and is expected 
to be sidelined for several months. Magrane had surgery on his pitching elbow 
and isn't expected to begin throwing for two months. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Northridge basketball players and coaches aren't exactly overjoyed about 
having to play a home game against Northeastern Illinois tonight at Pepperdine 
instead of in their own school gym. 
</P>
<P>
 It does, however, beat either alternative: canceling the game or playing 
Northeastern Illinois at its gym in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is something out of the ordinary for them, but it's just one more 
thing," Coach Pete Cassidy said of his players. "For this team, there is no 
ordinary. We're just taking the cards as they're dealt." 
</P>
<P>
 There will be no admission charge for the game at Pepperdine. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge lost to 18th-ranked California by 30 points, but if Cassidy had 
altered his substitution pattern the Matadors might have cut that deficit in 
half. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of keeping his regulars in for the game's last seven or eight minutes, 
Cassidy turned to his bench even before Cal Coach Todd Bozeman emptied his. 
</P>
<P>
 Cassidy said that giving game time to his reserves was more important than 
trying to make the final score more respectable. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wasn't throwing in the towel," Cassidy said, "but they were leading by 20 
and I didn't see that changing much. I'm going to give my guys all the good 
game experience I can if I'm going to expect them to play for us next year." 
JUNIOR COLLEGES 
</P>
<P>
 Streak Busters 
</P>
<P>
 The Ventura women's team saw its 39-game winning streak in Western State 
Conference play end in a 52-51 loss to Oxnard last week.  
</P>
<P>
 "They (Oxnard) came out ready to kick our butts and accomplished their goal," 
Ventura Coach Ned Mircetic said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura shook it off in a hurry. Last Saturday, the Pirates trounced Moorpark, 
78-36. Mircetic said the streak-breaking defeat served a purpose. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now we can refocus on the things we were doing before the loss," Mircetic 
said. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Despite a dwindling roster, the Antelope Valley men's basketball team is 
hanging tough in the Foothill Conference race. 
</P>
<P>
 The Marauders, who were 16-11 and 9-4 in conference play before Wednesday's 
game against Barstow, have lost four players from their original 12-man roster 
but were tied for second place in the conference with Rio Hondo. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are down to 7 1/2 players," Coach Newton Chelette said. "Our point guard 
(Troy Coutee) has been playing with strained ligaments in a knee." 
</P>
<P>
 Coutee, a 5-11 freshman from Antelope Valley High, is the latest casualty. He 
suffered the injury on Jan. 15. 
</P>
<P>
 Guards Damon Boyd and David Garner and centers David Daviss and Mark Hennager 
left the team earlier for various reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Chelette said Boyd, a freshman from Washington High, was homesick. Daviss 
enlisted in the military, and Hennager transferred to a four-year school, 
although not to play basketball. Garner didn't return from Christmas vacation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it made us a better team," Chelette said. "The guys came together as 
a team. . . . It's been tough but we don't think about it. We just keep on 
ticking as best we can." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Ventura point guard Joey Ramirez, who underwent cartilage surgery Monday on 
his right knee, is hoping to return for the WSC North Division season finale 
against Oxnard on Feb. 19. 
</P>
<P>
 But Pirate Coach Philip Mathews says Ramirez most likely won't see action 
until the Southern California regionals on Feb. 26. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's Joey. He wants to get back," Mathews said. "He is already 
rehabilitating the knee." 
</P>
<P>
 Ramirez was injured against Moorpark on Jan. 24 but continued to play through 
last Saturday with a brace. He also rode a stationary bike at the end of the 
Ventura bench during warm-ups. 
</P>
<P>
 "He used (the bike) the last couple of games," Mathews said. "If he sat down 
for a long period of time, his knee stiffened up." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Former Moorpark running back Gil Carrillo is continuing his quest for a spot 
on a Canadian Football League team. 
</P>
<P>
 Carrillo, 5-11 and 195 pounds, had a tryout last month with the Winnipeg Blue 
Bombers but was not offered a contract. He still hopes to hear from the club. 
</P>
<P>
 "It went real well," Carrillo said. "One of their people told me he didn't 
know why they hadn't signed me right then and there." 
</P>
<P>
 While he waits for a possible call from Winnipeg, Carrillo is lining up more 
tryouts with other CFL teams. He has been in contact with the Las Vegas, San 
Antonio and Hamilton franchises. Many of the teams, he said, will hold combines 
between March and May. 
</P>
<P>
 The Winnipeg tryout, which emphasized speed tests, prompted him to alter his 
workouts. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've changed my training a lot," Carrillo said. "I'm concentrating more on 
speed work and endurance instead of working so much in the weight room." 
</P>
<P>
 The former Simi Valley High standout, who rushed for 2,287 yards in his two 
seasons at Moorpark, doesn't have any college eligibility remaining. He 
attended Cal State Northridge on a track scholarship two years before 
transferring to Moorpark. THE MASTER'S 
</P>
<P>
 A Cheer for Oates 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Mel Hankinson compiled a 99-68 record -- including three consecutive 
20-win seasons -- during his five-year stint at Master's, but first-year Coach 
Bill Oates has managed to become more popular at the Newhall school than his 
predecessor. 
</P>
<P>
 Before Saturday night's 84-75 victory over Biola, the school honored Oates' 
600th career victory, which came earlier this season against Cal State Los 
Angeles. As Oates entered Bross Gymnasium, the standing-room crowd began to 
chant, "Oates, Oates, Oates!" 
</P>
<P>
 The chanting stopped long enough for Master's President John MacArthur to 
summarize the highlights of Oates' coaching career, but it began again when 
Oates' wife and three children were introduced. 
</P>
<P>
 "The students are really behind us here," a typically subdued Oates said after 
Master's improved to 22-3. "It's nice to have that type of support." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If teams reflect their coaches' personalities, then Master's is a case in 
point. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the animated, swaggering Hankinson, the Mustangs were a team that played 
in streaks. With the unassuming, composed Oates on the sidelines, they have 
been a model of consistency. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been conscious about being ready to play every game this season," Oates 
said. "We haven't had a lot of letdowns this year." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Cal State Northridge has the Matamaniacs, but a group of students at Master's 
called the Blue Zoo might top them for overall zaniness and vocal support at 
basketball games. 
</P>
<P>
 Although most zoo members are decked out in wild clothing, wigs, sunglasses 
and blue, white and yellow makeup, another dresses as an official. 
</P>
<P>
 When a referee makes a questionable call against the Mustangs, the zoo erupts 
in chants of "sub, sub, sub" while the zoo zebra raises his hand as if he's 
about to come in from the sidelines. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 How loud was the crowd at Saturday's Biola-Master's game? 
</P>
<P>
 Several spectators -- including one sportswriter who has covered previous 
Biola-Master's affairs -- showed wearing earplugs. 
</P>
<P>
 Others did not, including another sportswriter who left Bross Gymnasium with a 
slight ringing in his ears. Around the Campuses . . . 
</P>
<P>
 * Andre Chevalier, who has led the Northridge basketball team in scoring in 
four of its past five games, has moved into fourth place on the school's career 
scoring list. The 6-0 senior has 1,176 points -- 28 shy of third-place Jerry 
Joseph, who played from 1967-70, and 125 back of record-holder Jim Malkin, who 
played from 1959-62. Chevalier is averaging 13.2 points a game. He needs to 
average just under 18 points in the Matadors' last seven games to pass Malkin. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Antelope Valley men's basketball team was leading the Foothill 
Conference in margin of victory before Wednesday's games, winning by an average 
of 11.6 points. The Marauders were averaging 93.4 points and giving up 81.8. 
Chaffey (99.2 and 87.7) was second at 11.5. 
</P>
<P>
 * With a 22-3 record and an 11-game winning streak, Master's moved to 14th in 
the NAIA Division I poll after being 21st last week and 24th the week before -- 
its first top 25 ranking.

 Shawn Stone, a 6-foot-3 inch swingman, has taken over the Cal State Northridge 
team lead in rebounds. Stone has 93 rebounds, 10 more than forward Chris Yard, 
who is out for the season because of a knee injury. 
</P>
<P>
 Yard, who has missed five games, still leads every other Matador. Brent 
Lofton, a part-time starter, has 74 -- nine fewer than Yard. Center Peter 
Micelli, who has started every game, has only 70. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's not getting to the boards," Coach Pete Cassidy said of Micelli. "It's 
not because he doesn't want to. He just has the habit of standing and 
watching." 
</P>
<P>
 Cassidy said Micelli, a 6-8 junior, would routinely critique himself while 
watching game films in the Northridge basketball office. 
</P>
<P>
 "He could see his mistakes," Cassidy said. "Back when we had an office, he did 
that on a regular basis." 
</P>
<P>
 Matador players and coaches have been unable to use the basketball office 
since the Northridge gym was closed after the Jan. 17 earthquake. MIKE HISERMAN

THEATER REVIEWS; LITTLE OF INTEREST LIVES ON 'THIS ISLAND' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT KOEHLER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Once, musicals were written, then tried out in towns such as Boston and 
Cleveland. There, the kinks were worked out before hitting Broadway. The 
results weren't always wonderful, but the process was good enough for such 
people as Jule Styne, Richard Rodgers and Frank Loesser. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, musicals are "developed." They're sent through the mill known as 
workshops. Some authors swear by them. But the ones who do would have to 
explain something like "Once on This Island." 
</P>
<P>
 Filled with wall-to-wall music, lots of flowery dresses and a nearly soporific 
languidness, this work by Lynn Ahrens (book and lyrics) and Stephen Flaherty 
(music) is the quintessential musical-in-development. 
</P>
<P>
 Its Orange County premiere, care of the Buena Park Civic Theatre, happens to 
be in the not-so-friendly confines of the multipurpose, multi-awkward Buena 
Park High School Performing Arts Complex. The show has a hard enough time 
placing us in the colonial world of the French Antilles, but the oddly angled, 
acoustic-poor complex does a good job of adding to the distance from the story. 
</P>
<P>
 And the story is what "Once on This Island" wants to be all about. 
</P>
<P>
 The BMI workshop is the particular mill "Island" was sent through, until it 
landed on the off-Broadway Playwrights Horizon stage in 1990. From there, it 
was on to Broadway and Tony nominations. It was the little show that did good. 
It was, even more, a musical that could be cast with brown, black and yellow 
faces, a kind of multicultural heaven for theaters everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Once it hit the road, such as its stop at the Wilshire Theatre in Beverly 
Hills in 1992, some wondered what all the fuss was about. You can double the 
wonder in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 Ahrens builds her tale on a trite premise: A bad storm is about to pound the 
island, and the adults in a village try to calm the young ones' fears with a 
story about courage. 
</P>
<P>
 Alas, the inner story is even more trite than the outer one: Ti Moune (April 
Weeden), growing into young womanhood, discovers a young, attractive non-native 
Frenchmen named Daniel (Vincent Aniceto) in a crashed car by the side of a 
road. 
</P>
<P>
 Against the traditions of both her poor brethren and French colonial society, 
she fights for a life of love with Daniel, who, of course, is engaged to a 
woman of his own caste. Think of "West Side Story" filtered through an 
ersatz-Michener milieu, and you begin to approach this narrative's staleness. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Precisely because the show's entire premise is built on the power of 
storytelling, Ahrens' book is much more impotent than one would usually notice 
in a musical. And at every point where the show needs the lift of music, 
Flaherty's wan score carries no weight. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, it feels lighter than air, liberally borrowing strains from Pat 
Metheny's tropical-ized jazz and Sting's reggae-isms, but with no distinctive 
passion of its own. 
</P>
<P>
 Only rarely, as in Daniel's melodious "Some Girls," do music and lyrics 
enlarge character -- something one would assume a workshop process would hone 
to a fine, hard edge. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, director and musical director Tim Nelson's staging feels lulled 
into the same kind of stupor in which the musical itself is stuck. There's a 
kind of U.N. family-of-man comfiness that permeates both the staging and 
Jennifer Simpson's not-very-Caribbean choreography, and they're much too soft 
to support what is, after all, a drama of identity and will. 
</P>
<P>
 Nelson, though, is helped in one area, even as he's hindered in another. While 
his very young cast, especially Weeden and Aniceto, is almost uniformly weak at 
delivering the songs, his band of skillful reed players and hot percussionists 
genuinely helps push the performance along when most needed. 
</P>
<P>
 Another shove comes from the wiry, wily Jeff Baker as the death god, Ti 
Moune's own tempting Beelzebub. * "Once on This Island," Buena Park High School

AN UNEVEN 'BOUQUET' TO SCOTT JOPLIN; DESPITE TWO STRONG LEADS IN THIS STORY OF 
THE RAGTIME COMPOSER, THE ENSEMBLE THEATRE PRODUCTION STUMBLES ON THE DREAMY, 
POETIC STYLE OF ERIC OVERMYER'S PLAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Scott Joplin was a man of his time, and in one way it was the right time. The 
American public was ready for ragtime music; Joplin's first big hit, the "Maple 
Leaf Rag," became the most popular rag ever. 
</P>
<P>
 But in another way it was the wrong time. Racial bigotry, just a few decades 
after the Civil War, was politically correct, and the idea that Joplin would 
grow into more than just a composer of popular ditties was scoffed at. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a shame that no one has thought to make a film of Joplin's eccentric and 
tragic life and his development into an American composer of note. Eric 
Overmyer sort of fills the gap with his theatrical tone poem "The Heliotrope 
Bouquet by Scott Joplin & Louis Chauvin," at the Ensemble Theatre through 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a dream play, a many-layered hallucination of Joplin's in 1916, the year 
before he died of syphilis. Bouncing back and forth between the reality of his 
current sad state and briefly flashing memories of past times high and low, 
Joplin has trouble connecting with either. 
</P>
<P>
 Overmyer weaves emotions, philosophy and the composer's desperate hunger for 
recognition into an intriguing (if sometimes broad and simplistic) poetic 
patchwork of moments, rather than a chronological history. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At the Ensemble, Roosevelt Blankenship Jr. directed the piece and plays 
Joplin, both as a young man and (effectively without makeup) at the end of his 
rope and his life. It's the right performance in the wrong production, as is 
Mellow Martin's volatile and intricate tour de force as Chauvin, Joplin's 
friend and sometime collaborator. Both actors know how to deal with Overmyer's 
primary-colored style. 
</P>
<P>
 But as a director, Blankenship hasn't been able to translate the play's 
drug-hazy aura into a viable theatrical form. He also hasn't found other actors 
comfortable in the style. 
</P>
<P>
 Jason Powell almost makes the grade both as an amusingly shy trick in a New 
Orleans sporting house and as a high-kicking high-flyer in a St. Louis cafe, 
but he lacks the focus that would make his roles shine. Dorsey Watson has the 
same problem as the swinging Tom Turpin. 
</P>
<P>
 Wichasta V. Reese has a couple of good moments as one of the New Orleans 
hookers and both of Joplin's wives, but she differentiates little. And the 
action almost comes to a halt when Barry Baxter is on as Joplin's publisher, 
reading his lines like the evening news and waving his hands wildly. * "The 
Heliotrope Bouquet by Scott Joplin & Louis Chauvin," Ensemble Theatre, 844 E. 
Lincoln Ave., Suite E, Orange. Thursday-Saturday, 8 p.m. Ends Saturday. $8-$10.

RECORD REVIEW; TERRIFIC LIVE CUTS BY R.E.M., U2 PROPEL 'NRG'; *** VARIOUS

<P>
 Terrific gimmick and some terrific music, though the real fuel of this 
solar-powered project is the dynamic superstar live performances of R.E.M. 
("Drive") and U2 (a soaring "Until the End of the World"). 
</P>
<P>
 It's impossible to maintain those highs throughout a 16-song compilation, but 
the disparate selections here are almost uniformly worthy.Top moments range 
from smoothie Annie Lennox to forceful Disposable Heroes of Hiphoprisy to 
rambunctious L7, while earnestly shambling troubadours James and dark 
noise-meisters the Jesus and Mary Chain and Sonic Youth also stand out. The one 
loser: Soundgarden with former Queen guitarist Brian May, a teaming that 
emphasizes the bombastic elements of each without their sometimes redeeming 
grace.

 New albums are rated on a scale of one star (poor), two stars (fair), three

LIFE & TIMES / WENDY MILLER: TAKING A CLOSER LOOK AT OUR CELEBRATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WENDY MILLER, Wendy Miller is editor of Ventura County Life.

 Things happen over a meal. Business deals are consummated, gossip is exchanged 
and momentous events are commemorated. 
</P>
<P>
 Over meals we celebrate beginnings, solemnize ends and mark every occasion in 
between. Even the rocky road to love is paved with the credit card receipts, 
tucked into Leatherette bill holders and discreetly slipped onto the candle-lit 
table during those many romantic meals consumed at posh restaurants. An evening 
out generally means dinner. Or it's dinner and a movie, dinner and a play, or 
dinner and a concert. When we start combining meals with other forms of 
entertainment, however, it can get rather costly. 
</P>
<P>
 In an effort to combine both tariffs and yet make the evening palatable, 
entrepreneurs everywhere have brought us the great combo deal: dinner and 
theater. Sometimes a great notion, though, leads one to wonder: When folks 
flock to hear Frank Sinatra Jr. at a Holiday Inn, is it the chicken dinner or 
Junior singing "I've Got You Under My Skin" that's the serious draw? 
</P>
<P>
 A few Ventura County venues offer the dinner theater combo deal, though 
Sinatra has yet to come to these parts. And since we like to get to the bottom 
of things that appear on the dinner table, we sent staff writer Leonard Reed -- 
one of our restaurant reviewers -- to check it out. Reed, among other things, 
likes a good meal and loves a great performance. But he's the worst of cranks 
when one is played off at the expense of the other. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd rather eat well, simply, and go to a show, than eat extravagantly and 
badly at the show and feel bad all night," he said. "You can get it both ways 
around here. So beware. It's never a good deal if you've got to fight for your 
food and then wind up staring down at it, afraid." 
</P>
<P>
 Bon appetit. And enjoy the show. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, in other news, thoughts have turned to Valentine's Day, that day 
when hearts fill with love and gold-foiled hearts fill with chocolate. In last 
week's Shop Talk column, Leo Smith offered tips for interesting and reasonably 
priced Valentine's Day gifts for the man in your life. This week, Julie Sawyer 
speaks up for the women. And in the Fashion column, Kathleen Williams notes 
that this is a popular time for troth pledging among singles. According to 
Williams' informal poll, the diamond continues to be the No. 1 favorite among 
local couples looking for that perfect symbol of eternal love. Well, it 
certainly wasn't going to be the chocolate, which in my house won't make it to 
Tuesday.

SOUNDS: OXNARD COMPOSER RETURNS HOME FOR SYMPHONY DEBUT; MIGUEL DEL AGUILA'S 
1988 PIECE "TOCCATA" RECEIVES ITS WEST COAST PREMIERE SATURDAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 This will be a big week for the Ventura County Symphony. The comfortable 
midsection of its current season brings a romantic program of Dvorak's tuneful 
old standby, the New World Symphony, and Brahms Piano Concerto No. 1. Nothing 
new there. 
</P>
<P>
 But all ears should be trained on the opening piece, the first local 
performance of a work by the young, internationally recognized composer Miguel 
del Aguila, who calls Oxnard home but whose commissions and performances often 
take place in Europe. Del Aguila's 1988 piece "Toccata," receiving its West 
Coast premiere this Saturday, is brief but pungent, an elegant whirling dervish 
of a work that manages to use an accessible, mostly tonal language toward 
original ends. 
</P>
<P>
 The Uruguayan-born, Vienna-trained composer has an intriguing compositional 
voice, at once celebrating his Latin American heritage and embracing such 
musical influences as early modernism, post-romanticism, jazz and pop music. 
</P>
<P>
 His clever, energetic Piano Sonata No. 2 (also written in 1988) was recently 
included on the compact disc "Piano Music of the Americas," performed by James 
Miltenberger for the ACA label. Del Aguila's Sonata fits neatly in a program 
that includes music of the Argentine modernist Alberto Ginastera and George 
Gershwin, composers whose influence is woven into del Aguila's ideas. 
</P>
<P>
 It will be good to hear the composer's work in his own hometown. 
</P>
<P>
 But wait, there's more. The most provocative news from the symphony front 
comes Tuesday, when conductor Boris Brott kicks off an inventive 
non-subscription, three-concert series called "Musics Alive!" 
</P>
<P>
 For anyone who has felt that Brott -- now in only his second season -- has 
followed a mostly straight and narrow programming path thus far, this is the 
music director's promised payoff, a series dedicated to contemporary composers 
and world music. 
</P>
<P>
 True, the concerts have been relegated to small, offbeat venues around the 
county -- Tuesday's concert takes place at the Poinsettia Pavilion in Ventura 
-- but the entire project is an ambitious step in the right direction. 
</P>
<P>
 Brott, typically ebullient and peripatetic, called from LAX just minutes 
before his flight took off, to have a few words with a reporter. His itinerary 
would take him to Toronto, Rotterdam, New York and Montreal. The road is the 
constant companion of a conductor with multiple commitments and guest shots. 
</P>
<P>
 He spoke about the conceptual seeds for the series. "The world of composition 
is becoming more and more international, as is the world of everything else, as 
well. Composers who live and work in Western spheres are, I think, influenced 
by world music. 
</P>
<P>
 "It can be said that throughout the 20th Century there's been an intrigue and 
interest in the East, for instance, and in non-Western musical languages and 
techniques, and sound colors, from Ravel and Debussy on. But I think this is 
even more prevalent today. We wanted to explore that relationship in each of 
these concerts." 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday's concert focuses, for its non-Western component, on the music of 
Indonesia. The Indonesian Gamelan Orchestra, from CalArts, directed by I Nyoman 
Wenton, will perform, alone and with Western instruments. Wenton's composition 
"Crossovers," will feature gamelan, African instruments and woodwind ensemble. 
</P>
<P>
 There will also be music in the middle, from East-leaning Western composer Lou 
Harrison, whose fascination with Indonesian culture dates back decades. 
</P>
<P>
 We will also hear Mel Powell's "Modules, an Intermezzo for Chamber Orchestra." 
Powell, who will be present to answer questions from the audience, is -- 
despite his relative obscurity to general audiences -- one of the most 
important and well-rounded living composers. He joined the ranks of Pulitzer 
Prize winners in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Powell is the product of multiple influences over a life in music. He studied 
jazz, was in on the seminal era of electronic music, and has produced a 
striking body of uncompromising post-serial pieces. What we hear in Powell's 
work is a finely honed and personalized cross-section of musical impulses from 
the 20th Century. 
</P>
<P>
 Rounding out Tuesday's concerts will be work by those 20th-Century pillars 
Milhaud and Stravinsky. 
</P>
<P>
 Next in the series, which is sponsored by the Barbara Smith Foundation, is the 
"China Alive!" concert at Ojai's Rancho del Ray on March 15. "India Alive!" 
will be at the Spanish Hills Country Club on April 12. 
</P>
<P>
 With the series, Brott sees his role as that of a cautious crusader. By 
presenting the concerts in a casual atmosphere and in humble venues, he hopes 
to build interest from the ground up. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hopefully, in the long term, our whole audience will become educated and be 
more interested in this sort of thing, and then we'll be able to play it in our 
main series. That's my goal. My goal is not to keep people firmly in the 18th 
and 19th Centuries," he said, laughing. 
</P>
<P>
 When it comes to the delicate task of presenting contemporary or 
non-mainstream music to a symphony audience, Brott noted, "Personally, I 
haven't seen many positive results in forcing it down their throats. They don't 
like it, and they stay in the lobby. It serves to reinforce their resistance. 
They're going to say 'Oh, not that again.' 
</P>
<P>
 "Whereas, I think we can get people from the main audience to come to the 
series. I know this from the experiences I've had in Hamilton (Ontario, where 
Brott lives), where I've built audiences for this kind of music, specifically. 
At the first concert, we had 35 subscribers, and by the third year, we were 
having 600 people. I think the same thing will happen here."

SIGHTS; BASHING BARRIERS AT 'ASSEMBLY OF THE ARTS'; SHOW AT VENTURA MUSEUM OF 
HISTORY AND ART GIVES A GENERAL OVERVIEW OF THE REGION'S SCENE. 
</P>

 Ventura County's art scene is a relatively happy cosmos, in which familiar 
names spin and drift through various group shows and galleries show a rotating 
roster of artists. But, as per the human nature of cultural clannishness, it 
can also be a factional scene, one in which fringe-oriented art keeps to its 
own corner, decorative pretty pictures to another, academic art to another, and 
on and on. 
</P>
<P>
 Barrier-bashing is one of the virtues found in the "Assembly of the Arts" 
show, now at the Ventura Museum of History and Art through March 6. This 
manageably sized sampling of county-grown art, juried by art professionals from 
Santa Barbara and Santa Monica, offers a one-stop shopping trip for anyone in 
need of a general overview of art in the region. 
</P>
<P>
 Art-watchers may see many recurring names here, but the familiarity usually 
turns out to be a positive attribute, rather than an example of stasis or 
complacency. We're allowed a sense of continuity and evolution by observing the 
subtle changes in the work and perspective of these artists. 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing hanging this year will arouse the controversy and/or bemusement of 
last year's first-place-winning faux naif painting by Kyle Lynds. But there is 
enough diversity among the winners to stave off curatorial homogeneity. 
</P>
<P>
 And the official winners of this 12th annual show are. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The first prize went to Christine Brennan's "Untitled," one of the Ojai 
artist's trademark, enchanted nocturnal fantasies. Mutant mouthless creatures 
engage in romantic or metaphysical activities, as in a dream of life on the 
moon. Part surrealism, part childish charm, Brennan's work spills from an 
imagination suitable for all ages. 
</P>
<P>
 Second place went to Mark Matthews, still pushing the limits of photography 
with his "Healing Waters." Part documented assemblage, Matthews' piece finds 
clay figures in a dramatic, surreally lit scenario. An ambiguous sense of dread 
and danger comes through in a scene in which a woman carries an inert figure 
down to the proverbial river. 
</P>
<P>
 In third place was "Turning Point," by regular "Assembly" participant Richard 
Peterson. Like Peterson's other socially charged work, his portrait of patients 
in the "Turning Point" program gives an empathetic human face to statistical 
suffering. 
</P>
<P>
 Although not officially honored in the awards, the piece that most challenges 
the sensibilities of the casual visitor, on the basis of its gritty materials, 
unsettling base of ideas and sheer scale, is Alberta Fins' "Rites of Passage 
XII." A multimedia triptych whose elements include swatches of fabric and 
plastic, murky photographs and massive smears of paint, the work is informed by 
a certain rawness of form and content, evident in smaller, more restrained 
doses in Fins' earlier work. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruggedly constructed, and not at all smooth or seamless, Fins' work looks as 
if it were created in a throes of a ritual. Photos of clothespins on the line 
and painted crosses echo her recurring interest in crucifix imagery. Turbulent 
and energetic, the work hums with religious questioning and a sense of 
catharsis through art-making. 
</P>
<P>
 On more purely sensuous terms, the most impressive painting in the gallery has 
to be "Picnic," by Suzanne Schechter (another regular contributor to "Assembly" 
shows). 
</P>
<P>
 In this formally paradoxical painting, the irony begins with the title. We see 
an ample, indistinct woman under an umbrella at the beach, basking in 
Hopper-esque, all-American desolation. A picnic is in the mind of the beholder. 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from the atmosphere of exquisite emptiness, Schechter also dips into 
Hopper's stylistic paint box, creating a realism that is rougher than it 
immediately appears. 
</P>
<P>
 The composition itself tells a story. The figure, a jumbled mass settled into 
her self-contained cocoon, consumes the left half, while the minimalistic bands 
of sand and sky, viewed from a slightly tilted perspective, take up the right 
half. Nature offers our heroine, more than anything, a pleasant moral vacuum. 
</P>
<P>
 An award for shameless levity should have been granted for Everett Kelley's 
send-up of Manet's "Olympia," with a voluptuous banana in the place of the 
French temptress. Illusionistic rendering distinguishes Eva Riser-Roberts' 
watercolor, "Crystal Harvest," all shimmery transparent surfaces with a 
verisimilitude remarkable for the medium. 
</P>
<P>
 In one corner of the gallery, enigmatic visions of water hang side by side. 
Nicole Erd's "Streams of Silence" is a palpable, dappled network of smudges 
that turn a river-side scene into the stuff of foggy dreams. John Charles 
Shippey's quasi-folkish "Shallow Water Blackout" revels in its shallow space 
and flat-colored splash of brushwork. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the sculptures are Matt Harvey's marble mass, "Bird-D," and M. B. 
Hanrahan's slab-like relief piece, "Damning Thieves," imprinted with its 
ghostly skeletal image. Visitors are encouraged to touch the sinuous loopy form 
of Michelle Chapin's "Continuous Line." 
</P>
<P>
 Jennie K. Snyder's "Winking Woman's Mirror" is a mosaic of mirror and glass 
pieces that looks at once a shrine to vanity and, potentially, a dangerous 
object in the event of an earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Tucked into a corner shyly -- and slyly -- is Carolyn Russell's wonderful 
"Hubcap Dream Green," another of her pint-sized little jewels. Subjects 
normally considered to be sociocultural funk -- a hubcap in a field, an old 
lawn chair, a boxy mobile home -- are strewn on a romantically depicted piece 
of the proverbial boonies, the outskirts. 
</P>
<P>
 All of this fits on a round canvas the size of, well, a hubcap. Funny, dank 
charm is the result. In some strange way, although small, it's also mighty. 
</P>
<P>
 Size, attitude and color schemes vary wildly in the "Assembly of the Arts," 
and more's the power for it. Pluralism is alive and well in Ventura County.

WORDS & IMAGES: AUTHOR TO OFFER TIPS ON GETTING KIDS TO READ; JIM TRELEASE WILL 
TELL PARENTS HOW TO DIVERT CHILDREN AWAY FROM TELEVISION AND MAKE 'BOOKS INTO 
FRIENDS.' 
</P>

<P>
 Those of us reared on reading are unable to kick the habit -- nor do we want 
to. And yet, information hounds that we are, we are drawn to television and 
watch incessantly. How can we inspire a generation addicted to seductive and 
often wonderful TV programming to discover the power and solitude (but not 
loneliness) that reading gives us? 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the answers will be provided by Jim Trelease, the best-selling author 
of "The New Read-Aloud Handbook" and two anthologies of children's stories, 
"Hey! Listen to This" and "Read All About It!" Trelease, who spent 20 years 
visiting hundreds of classrooms to talk with children about the joys of 
reading, now lectures all over the country. He will speak on "How to Motivate 
Children to Make Books Into Friends" at 7:30 p.m. next Thursday in the Cal 
Lutheran University gymnasium, 60 W. Olsen Road. 
</P>
<P>
 "The decline in American literacy," Trelease says, "is due in large part to 
the fact that two-thirds of our children no longer want to read. Reading aloud 
to a child is the oldest and most successful method of rekindling that desire." 
</P>
<P>
 Trelease will also offer a plan for helping parents diminish the influence of 
television on their children. 
</P>
<P>
 The event is coordinated by Colleen Briner-Schmidt and co-sponsored by the 
Thousand Oaks chapter of the American Assn. of University Women and CLU 
Continuing Education. Trelease's lectures are usually a sellout. Call 493-3130 
to reserve tickets, which are $7.50. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Jordan Jones of Simi Valley, editor of the literary journal Bakunin and author 
of the poetry collection "Sand & Coal," and Brent Cunningham will read at 7:30 
p.m. Saturday at the Arcade Poetry Series in the Performance Studio, 34 N. Palm 
St., Ventura. Call 652-2820. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Mysteries to Die For, 2940 Thousand Oaks Blvd., will host five practitioners 
of the mystery genre next week. Authors Janet La Pierre ("Old Enemies"), Marlys 
Millhiser ("Murder at Moot Point") and Karen Kijewski ("Wild Cat") will sign 
their books at 1:30 p.m. Monday. Camilla Crespi will sign "The Trouble With 
Thin Ice" at 1:30 p.m. Wednesday, followed at 3 p.m. by Jon Jackson, author of 
"Deadmen." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Plan Ahead: Nancy Carlson, author of one of the best books on self-esteem, "I 
Like Me," will give a story presentation of her new book, "Life Is Fun," from 3 
to 5 p.m. next Thursday at Adventures for Kids, 3457 Telegraph Road, Ventura.

COUNTRY ROUNDUP: KARAOKE GOES WESTERN AT LOCAL HONKY TONKS; MANY COUNTRY FANS 
HAVE TAKEN TO SINGING AT THEIR HANGOUTS, WHETHER FOR FUN OR IN HOPES OF BIG 
MONEY AND A SHOT AT STARDOM. 
</P>

 When country fans aren't dancing, many have taken to singing the blues away at 
weekly country karaoke nights or contests held in several area clubs. Some 
folks enter for fun, while others hope to win big money and get a shot at 
stardom. After all, regional favorite, Darlene O'Connell, got her start in 
karaoke contests. So take heart. 
</P>
<P>
 The Country Rose Saloon in Camarillo began its latest weekly contest series in 
mid-January, and previous winners will compete in the finals at 9 p.m. 
Saturday. The contest will go on hiatus Wednesday and Feb. 23, while 
deejay-host, Bill Bodenhamer, helps patrons practice country-Western open mike 
nights. But look for another contest to start next month. 
</P>
<P>
 Bodenhamer hosts karaoke from 9 p.m. to 1:30 a.m. on Wednesdays, Fridays and 
Saturdays. There is no charge to enter the contests, which are held on 
Wednesdays. Just sign up by 8:30 p.m. and they'll call your name after you've 
had a chance to practice. About 12 people compete each week. And although the 
format is mostly country music, some rotation does occur. For example, last 
night was to be dedicated to Elvis songs. Winners receive certificates for food 
and beverages at Country Rose. 
</P>
<P>
 If you'd like to sample other karaoke nights, try the Ban-Dar, Ventura's 
original honky tonk, on Tuesdays. Cousin's Country Saloon in Simi Valley 
dedicates Mondays to country karaoke sing-along, 7 to 11 p.m., hosted by deejay 
James Owens, aka JYMO. Smokey's in Ventura offers predominantly country karaoke 
9 p.m. to 1 a.m. with emcee, Tony. And Nicholby's, another Ventura night spot, 
recently started booking acoustic sets on Thursday nights followed by open-mike 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Give From the Heart," an earthquake relief fund-raising event sponsored by 
Ventura Harbor Village for the American Red Cross and the Salvation Army, is 
scheduled noon to 4 p.m. Sunday at the Village. Activities will include dancing 
to the music of the Rhythm Rangers band and a demo by Rick Henderson and 
members of the Country Lovers Western Dance Club. At 2 p.m. Charlye Parker will 
host a live auction of merchandise donated by local businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Folks are urged to attend and bring donations of canned food, bottled water, 
blankets, sleeping bags, clothing, baby products and other items for your 
displaced neighbors. All funds raised will be divided between the two 
organizations to benefit residents of Ventura County. 
</P>

 Cupid's Corner: Best wishes to K-Hay radio's program/music director and on-air 
personality, Mark (James) Hill, and his bride, Cindy. The honeymooners jumped 
the Valentine's Day gun and got hitched Jan. 29. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, Splash's Rockin' Rodeo Night's most loyal country couple (of matching 
shirts fame) Jerri Holmes and her beau, Joe Noone, are expecting to tie the 
knot on Valentine's Day in Laughlin, Nevada. Frances Procter, owner of 
Ventura's Dancin' Designs, made the dress for a real country-Western look. 
</P>
<P>
 While we're on the subject of Valentine's Day -- doesn't this trend of 
country-Western weddings make ya feel all soft and buttery? So if you're 
planning a wedding, especially second time around, take note that many couples 
are walking down the aisle in cowboy boots. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Changes: Until the weather perks up, don't expect Rick Henderson to be 
teaching his popular outdoor dance lessons the second Sunday of each month at 
Harbor Landing in Channel Islands Harbor. But they'll resume soon. Watch this 
column for details. 
</P>
<P>
 Goleta's Galleon Room has moved dance lessons from Saturday to Thursday, 7 to 
8:30 p.m. But a live country band still plays for dancing Thursdays through 
Saturdays. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Hill has stepped into Tim Buley's slots at Logsdons in Santa Paula. So 
now you can catch Steve there Wednesdays through Saturdays. 
</P>
<P>
 Both K-Hay's Ray Taylor and Charlye Parker are celebrating birthdays this 
month. But I'll never tell how old they are.

THEATER REVIEW; 'WINTER'S TALE' BLENDS TRAGEDY WITH COMEDY; THE SHAKESPEARE 
DRAMA IS ACTUALLY TWO PLAYS, WITH THE ACTION SWITCHING DIRECTION AFTER ACT 1. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TODD EVERETT, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Local theater fans have a rare opportunity to see one of Shakespeare's more 
obscure works, "The Winter's Tale," in a typically fine California Shakespeare 
Company production. 
</P>
<P>
 Two plays in one, "The Winter's Tale" begins as a tragedy, swinging into a 
romantic comedy at the halfway point. The first "play" tells of Leontes, king 
of Sicilia. A jealous man, he has reason to believe that his wife Hermione has 
taken up with his old friend Polixenes, King of Bohemia, and that Polixenes is 
planning to kill him. Leontes jails his wife, who gives birth to a daughter in 
prison. Their son, already sickly, dies of grief. 
</P>
<P>
 Wrongly believing the infant to be Polixenes', he orders her killed. That 
doesn't happen, and Act II follows the adventures of the baby -- Perdita -- now 
16 years old and ready for romance. She falls in love with Florizel, son of 
Polixenes, and the two, unaware of the events of Act I, travel back to Sicilia 
and Leontes' court, where (to coin a phrase), all's well that ends well. 
</P>
<P>
 Shakespeare -- who based much of the play on "Pandosto, The Triumph of Time," 
a 1588 novel by English writer Robert Greene -- makes the whole plot somewhat 
believable, while filling it with interesting characters, such as the 
pickpocket Autolycus, entirely his own invention. There's plenty of low comedy 
as well as romance in the second half, and "The Winter's Tale" features the 
enactment of what may be Shakespeare's most famous (and certainly his funniest) 
stage direction: "Exit, pursued by a bear." 
</P>
<P>
 California Shakespeare Company artistic director William Fisher has once again 
assembled a fine, large cast, bringing several new faces to the local stage in 
addition to several longtime favorites. Darren Raleigh plays Leontes, with 
Christine Failla as Hermione, David Steel as their ill-fated son, and Virginia 
Worley as Perdita. 
</P>
<P>
 Kelly Vincent co-stars as Polixenes, with Vincent Wares as his crafty 
associate Camillo, and Aaron Craig as dashing prince Florizel. Joshua Farrell 
plays Antigonus, who takes sympathy on infant Perdita, and Jill Macy is his 
loudmouth, busybody of a wife, Paulina. 
</P>
<P>
 Nathan Clark shines as the pickpocket Autolycus, and Jules Mandel is very 
funny as both the shepherd who adopts Perdita and (in a three-piece 
more-or-less modern business suit) the personification of Time, who gives a 
brief speech in which 16 years pass like a minute. 
</P>
<P>
 (Craig appears again, in what may be the world's worst wig, as the shepherd's 
oafish son). 
</P>
<P>
 As in all California Shakespeare Company productions, there's virtually no 
scenery, though costumes are lavish. The lack of a stage set doesn't detract; 
rather, it makes concentration on the dialogue and action even easier than it 
otherwise might be. Details 
</P>
<P>
 * WHAT: "The Winter's Tale." 
</P>
<P>
 * WHEN: Friday and Saturday evenings at 8; Sunday afternoons at 3, through 
March 13. 
</P>
<P>

Moorpark. 
</P>

THEATER REVIEW; 'GODSPELL,' MINUS '60S TRAPPINGS, REVISITED; UPDATED FOR THIS 
CAMARILLO PRODUCTION, THE SHOW HOLDS UP SURPRISINGLY WELL; BETTER, CERTAINLY, 
THAN BELL-BOTTOMS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TODD EVERETT, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A recent professional revival of "Hair" hits London, and bus-and-truck 
companies of "Jesus Christ Superstar" and "Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor 
Dreamcoat" are touring the United States. The hippie musical seems to be 
joining bell-bottom trousers and the Village People as artifacts that once 
seemed so much of their own time to defy revival. 
</P>
<P>
 Add to that list "Godspell," the 1971 musical based on the biblical Book of 
Matthew. It's back, and in the hands of the Camarillo Community Theater. 
Updated for this production by director Michael Voll, the show holds up 
surprisingly well; better, certainly, than those bell-bottoms. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, a lot of the '60s trappings are gone -- Jesus, for instance, no 
longer wears the painted face of a clown, and the Apostles are no longer, 
quite, flower children. Also, Voll has peppered the script with current social 
and cultural touchstones, including Reebok sneakers, H. Ross Perot, and "Don't 
hate me because I'm beautiful." 
</P>
<P>
 Voll has assembled a generally top-notch cast, featuring Gabriel Arciniega as 
Jesus, Jeff Hall as John the Baptist and Judas, and Jerry Baldonado, Melora 
Dacayana, Heidi Goodspeed, Jenna Greenberg, Jayme Housh, Ron Rogers and 
"Spanky" as the Apostles. Each gets a moment in the spotlight. Spanky is the 
group's comedian, but Rogers shines as the pig in an enactment of one of 
Jesus's parables. 
</P>
<P>
 The songs were never the strong points of "Godspell," though "Day by Day" (the 
show's one sort-of hit) is pleasant enough. "Beautiful City" deserves more 
attention, and the one song not written by Stephen Schwartz -- Jay Hamburger 
and Peggy Gordon's "Side by Side" -- is another standout. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Allan choreographed the show, and musical director Penny Puente leads a 
band that includes Kevin Parcher, Art Gibson, Larry J. English and Bill 
Hillstrom. Ronda Borgwardt sings "On the Willows" offstage; the show's overture 
is prerecorded. The live singing is generally quite good, with the choral work 
particularly stirring. 
</P>
<P>
 The script ("conceived by John-Michael Tebelak") has fun with the biblical 
stories without making fun of them. His is a show that might particularly, but 
not exclusively, appeal to Sunday school groups as it humanizes Jesus and his 
teachings. Details 
</P>
<P>
 * WHAT: Godspell 
</P>
<P>
 * WHEN: Friday and Saturday evenings at 8; Sundays at 7 p.m., through March 5. 
</P>
<P>
 * WHERE: Camarillo Airport Theater, 330 Skyway Drive, on the grounds of the 
Camarillo Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 * COST: $10 general admission; $8 students, seniors and active military; $5 
children under 12. A special "family package" -- two adult and up to four 
children's admissions -- is available for $25. 
</P>
<P>
 * FYI: For reservations or further information, call 388-5716. The performance 
on Feb. 27 only will be signed for the hearing-impaired by Mary Cancilla. The 
performance this Sunday will in part benefit the American Red Cross' Ventura 
earthquake relief program. Regular ticket prices prevail at both special 
performances.

NIGHT LIFE: READY FOR BATTLE; SHELLFISH TRIO HAS MEMORABLE LOCAL MUSIC 
CONNECTIONS. THEY WILL PLAY BATTLE OF BANDS AT THE METRO BAY CLUB IN VENTURA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL LOCEY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 These Shellfish move around more than a clam on a jet ski. 
</P>
<P>
 Bassist Colleen Coffey lives in Ventura, singer guitarist Peter Harb lives in 
Carpinteria and drummer Sid Hajdu lives in Agoura. They practice several times 
each week in Ventura and play whenever they can. Next time will be the endless, 
mindless, senseless and pretty fun Battle of the Bands on Wednesday night at 
the Metro Bay Club in Ventura. Already two months old, the Battle may go on 
until the Cubs win the pennant again, maybe longer. 
</P>
<P>
 Suppose your band put out a tape, then the band broke up, leaving you 500 
reminders of the bad ol' days. The Shellfish used to be the Withdrawals, but 
lost a member and became a trio that would still love to sell you a tape. 
</P>
<P>
 The members have some memorable local music connections for those who can 
remember beyond last Thursday. Coffey and Hajdu were in the terminally nervous 
Toast a few years ago. Coffey's brother, Bill, was the head Mudhead before 
relocating to Boise (just after the final Mudheads tape came out). Harb has 
been in a zillion bands in Carpinteria. 
</P>
<P>
 Shellfish plays edgy pop rock that rocks as Harb sings lead and Coffey 
harmonizes. It's not exactly Raging Harb & the Shellfish, but the soulful 
ballads are definitely in the minority with this band. At the band's practice 
site, the members discussed their music and all those Withdrawals tapes. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Why Shellfish? 
</P>
<P>
 Hajdu: A fresh start. 
</P>
<P>
 Harb: We have a song called "Shellfish," which is actually about being 
selfish. If you say "Shellfish" really fast three times, it becomes "selfish." 
We've only played three gigs so far as the Shellfish. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Isn't it hard to hide anyone when you're only a trio? 
</P>
<P>
 Harb: Sure it is. The Withdrawals just weren't doing what I wanted to do 
musically, but I still wanted to do something with Colleen and Sid because 
they're musicians I really enjoy playing with. It's not that I don't want to 
play with another guitarist, it's just that I haven't found the right one yet. 
Also, it really works as a three-piece, and you can really hear what's going 
on. 
</P>
<P>
 Hajdu: Ultimately, being a three-piece will make us better musicians. And 
later, if we want to add another guitarist, we can. 
</P>
<P>
 Coffey: I'd hear Sid play something and I'd ask him, "When did you start doing 
that?" And he'd tell me he always did. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Do you do Withdrawals songs? 
</P>
<P>
 Hajdu: Yeah, we do three of them off the tape. 
</P>
<P>
 Coffey: We've got 500 of them, so we've been using these white labels that fit 
right over them. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Is the local scene happening? 
</P>
<P>
 Coffey: It died. 
</P>
<P>
 Hajdu: It could be better. It's been better. It's been worse. 
</P>
<P>
 Coffey: Peter and I just got back from Boise to visit my brother, and there 
were a lot of places to play and a lot of college kids. Here, you have to bring 
your own fans. Most of the places here are over-21 bars, and we have a lot of 
fans that are under 21. There's not a lot of money to be made, either. 
</P>
<P>
 Harb: But one night at the Ventura Theatre when we were still the Withdrawals, 
this girl got down on her knees and asked me to marry her. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Did it work, marriage, I mean? 
</P>
<P>
 Harb: Well, she definitely got a phone call later. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Can a band get signed from Ventura? 
</P>
<P>
 Coffey: Only if you move somewhere else. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Is Shellfish the only band in the world that does a Mudheads song? 
</P>
<P>
 Coffey: Yeah, that we know of. When we were in Boise, Peter was playing "Right 
Where You Are," and my brother, Bill, was sitting there and after a few chords, 
he said: "Hey, that's my song. Do you remember the second verse? I forgot the 
words." 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What do you think Shellfish music sounds like? 
</P>
<P>
 Harb: Early '80s scrunge with pop sensibilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What's the creative process for writing a Shellfish song? 
</P>
<P>
 Harb: Well, if I'm feeling something like really crappy or amazingly good, 
then it just kind of happens. You just do it. If it just comes out in 20 or 30 
minutes, then it's honest, otherwise -- blah! I write about parents, girls and 
dealing with growing up. By the time I take it to the band, it's pretty much 
written and we know what we're doing and where we're going. I like Bob Mould 
and the Plimsouls. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Has Bob Mould ever smiled? 
</P>
<P>
 Harb: I don't think so. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Colleen, how did you end up playing the bass? 
</P>
<P>
 Coffey: In my first band, my friend Jenny Murphy was going to sing and play 
guitar, and this other girl was going to be the drummer. The bass was the only 
thing left. So I told my brother, and he got an old acoustic guitar, and took 
off a couple of strings and taught me how to play. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Weren't you in a Battle of the Bands before? 
</P>
<P>
 Coffey: Yeah, it was with Toast at Nordhoff High School. There was Mosaic, and 
some rock-poser band from T.O. and at the end, the judges ended up fighting. I 
couldn't take it, and we split before it was over, but we won and we got the 
300 bucks. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Is Shellfish going to start playing more? 
</P>
<P>
 Harb: I hope so. I hate waiting to play. 
</P>
<P>
 Coffey: I have to split time between school and the band. The biggest obstacle 
to band progress is my school. I'm working on a B.A. in American History from 
UCSB. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Are you going to re-enlist? 
</P>
<P>
 Coffey: I want to go to UCLA.

MUSIC; BAYOU MEETS THE BEACH; ZYDECO ZIPPERS MAY NOT BE AUTHENTICALLY CAJUN, 
BUT THEY SING SOME OF THEIR SONGS IN FRENCH. THEY'LL ADD FLAIR TO A MARDI GRAS 
PARTY SUNDAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL LOCEY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a party-crazy town like Santa Barbara, which has a hundred bars, a thousand 
bands and a million dancing fools, a zydeco band should be as popular as a Get 
Out Of Jail Free card that works. 
</P>
<P>
 Seeking to create their own musical monopoly, J.T. & the Zydeco Zippers will 
be playing at a Mardi Gras party Sunday night at the newly reopened SOhO on 
State Street, somewhat to the west of Bourbon Street. 
</P>
<P>
 Because Mardi Gras is the mother of all parties, the band will dress in 
costume and the fans are encouraged to be similarly sartorially splendid. 
</P>
<P>
 A zydeco band coming through town is not news, but a zydeco band from S.B., 
well now, that's like a surf band from Louisiana. The Cajun connection between 
the Bayou State and the Golden State, however, is a bit thinner than the okra 
crop in Alaska, according to J.T. Whitney himself. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, the closest we ever came to Louisiana has to do with our guitar player, 
Michael Frey, whose parents actually met in a bar in Lafayette. And our 
mandolin player, Michael Petracca, actually spent some time in Louisiana when 
he was a little kid." 
</P>
<P>
 Just because Santa Barbara hasn't been annexed by Louisiana doesn't mean the 
Zippers have been zapped. They've got a vast song list, and about a quarter of 
the songs are actually sung in French by any or all of the four vocalists who 
learned the language phonetically. Thus, the bayou meets the beach at a 
hooked-on-phonics seminar, but with a better beat. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a different style in California," said Whitney. "Even when musicians 
from Louisiana come out here, their style changes. We like to think variety 
works for us. We try to play traditional music as close as we can without 
actually going back there. We play Cajun and zydeco music, and we just put the 
word 'zydeco' in our name because it's a word people can identify." 
</P>
<P>
 Much of life is spent discovering what you don't like, then trying to avoid 
it. When Whitney discovered something he did like -- zydeco music -- the bright 
light from the bulb hovering over his head temporarily scared the swamp 
skeeters all the way back in the bayou. 
</P>
<P>
 "Originally, I heard Clifton Chenier and also Boozoo Chavis, another of the 
old guys who had a particular style," Whitney said. "Right now I like John 
DeLaFose & the Eunice Playboys. They're very solid. Yet, zydeco can get 
repetitive. Sometimes it's just a dance groove, riffing over and over." 
</P>
<P>
 Everything in music is over and over, or else it would be noise. The 
repetitive nature of zydeco music is a well-known cause of dancing. Dancing + 
Drinking = Happy club owners. You can look it up. A few months ago, the band 
was honored by a Santa Barbara entertainment weekly; kind words never hurt the 
ol' resume. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last fall, we were voted Best Local Rock Band," Whitney said. "We tied with 
Toad the Wet Sprocket. It was really exciting for a while, but it's pretty much 
forgotten now. We've been around for a while, but we don't really have a track 
record yet. 
</P>
<P>
 "It takes a long time to get something going up here. We get a few young kids 
at our shows, but the older people don't want to go out to a club because it's 
too late. Everyone comes when we play a daytime gig, but not so much at night. 
It's just fun for us that rubs off on the people that see us." 
</P>
<P>
 The band has made the rounds in S.B. with their first-ever gig at Art's Bar, 
where Boston Celtics' lover Art Lopez loves the Lakers in next-to-last place 
even more than he likes the blues. 
</P>
<P>
 "Art liked our music; he actually wanted us back, but we didn't make too much 
money," said Whitney. "When we played at Toes Tavern, they have a very young 
crowd. The people in front seemed to connect with us, but the people in the 
back were busy watching each other and shooting pool. We played at Smokey's in 
Ventura a few times, but one week they advertised on Q-105 and the next week 
they advertised on the country station, so that didn't work. But when we played 
Nicolby's in Ventura, we had about 25 people dancing. Right now, we're looking 
forward to do some outdoor stuff and some festivals." 
</P>
<P>
 In between gigs, Whitney, a carpenter, lends his digital dexterity to music, 
literally. Imagine a brain surgeon sharpening his own knives; imagine Whitney 
making his own accordions. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just started taking them apart. I'm mechanically inclined and I like to 
make things out of wood, and accordions are mostly made out of wood. Since I 
couldn't buy the accordion I wanted, I made it. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only parts I need are the reeds, the billows and some buttons. The first 
one I made, I used shirt buttons. There's a few places in Louisiana that make 
Cajun accordions. They have nice woodwork, but so do mine. I've sold a couple." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to Whitney, Frey and Petracca, the other members of the band dying 
to see their name in print include David Roine on fiddle and vocals, Randy 
Kizer on rub board, Michael Timothy Ryan on bass, and John Huxsol on drums. And 
how's this for some father-son bonding: Whitney's dad, Ralph, recently joined 
the band as a second rub-board player, and also hits one of those $65 triangles 
at just the right time. 
</P>
<P>
 Coming soon is some J.T. & the Zydeco Zippers music that you can hold in your 
hot little hand before it moves your sweaty little feet. 
</P>
<P>
 "We made a live recording last September at a party, and we're looking to do 
something high quality," said bandleader Whitney. "We're looking at a dozen 
songs, maybe more. It'll probably be a CD since they're getting very 
reasonable." Details

 Some folks travel all the way to New Orleans for Mardi Gras, so don't complain 
about driving up to San Luis Obispo for a small-scale version of the festival. 
</P>
<P>
 The city will host its 16th Annual Mardi Gras Celebration on Saturday, 
beginning with a fair from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. along Garden Street. There will be 
crafts, entertainment, food and mask- and costume-making booths as well as a 
gumbo cook-off with local restaurants competing for top honors. At 6:30 p.m., 
the Mardi Gras parade will make its way downtown. Like its Louisiana 
counterpart, it will have floats, elaborately costumed marchers and festive 
music. 
</P>
<P>
 The day will wrap up with the "Masque Bal" gala at the Veterans Memorial 
Building at Grand Avenue and Monterey Street. The $25 admission includes a 
buffet dinner and blues and zydeco tunes by Sunpie Barnes & the Louisiana 
Sunspots. For more information call 781-2777 or 541-2183.

 Six-time Grammy Award-winning gospel group The Mighty Clouds of Joy will 
perform Saturday at Campbell Hall. The 30-year-old group, which originated when 
its founding members where high school students in Los Angeles, has played at

Ray Charles, the Rolling Stones and Marvin Gaye. The group's album "Pray for 
Me" earned the Grammy for Best Gospel Album of 1992. The concert will begin at

at 8 p.m. The critically acclaimed acoustic ensemble performs music of the 
Andes on more than 30 instruments. Inti-Illimani's songs feature socially and 
politically conscious lyrics, which led to the group's exile from Chile in 
1973. General admission is $20, $17 and $14. Call 893-3535.

FOR THE KIDS; CHINESE ACROBATS SERVE UP MIND-BOGGLING STUNTS; GOLDEN DRAGON 
TROUPE IS COMING TO TOWN. SOME OF ITS FEATS HAVE BEEN PERFORMED FOR CENTURIES.

 The circus, Oriental style, is coming to town. If you thrill to the sight of 
people diving blindfolded through rings of fire and dodging knives, then don't 
miss the Chinese Golden Dragon Acrobats and Magicians. 
</P>
<P>
 This troupe of tumblers, dancers, and jugglers will perform at 3 p.m. Sunday 
at Ventura High School. Advance tickets are $12 for children 2 to 16 years old 
and $15 for adults, $1 more at the door. 
</P>
<P>
 The two-hour show is a benefit to help fund arts programs in county schools. 
Sponsors are the Ventura County superintendent of schools office, the Ventura 
Unified School District, the city of Ventura, and Radio AAHS, the kids radio 
station. 
</P>
<P>
 Promoters of the Chinese Golden Dragon Acrobats and Magicians bill the show as 
a circus without the animal smells -- so don't expect any wild animal acts. Do 
expect some amazing stunts requiring strength, balance and coordination, along 
with dancing and some Chinese-style comic relief. 
</P>
<P>
 In one mind-boggling stunt, a performer sets a chair on four champagne bottles 
atop a small table that is sitting on a larger table. Then he stacks seven 
chairs on top of each other and, perched at the top, he finishes off the feat 
with a one-handed handstand. 
</P>
<P>
 And then there is the one where the acrobats climb, one by one, onto a bicycle 
until they are stacked 10 high. And the one where a female performer balances 
herself on another woman's head -- first standing, then doing a handstand, and 
then a headstand. 
</P>
<P>
 The troupe numbers 14 to 18 brightly costumed acrobats, dancers and magicians, 
all from Taiwan. In Chinese, the term acrobat carries a much deeper meaning 
than it does in English. The skills and some of the feats performed by the 
troupe have existed since 200 BC, according to promoters, and are an important 
part of Chinese culture and art. The performers draw from a special Oriental 
philosophy where the body and mind work in harmony. 
</P>
<P>
 The producer and director of the show, Danny Chang, began his acrobatic 
training at the age of 8, and by his 10th birthday he was performing with his 
family's troupe. His father, grandfather and other relatives as far back as can 
be traced have been acrobats. 
</P>
<P>
 Now on tour in the United States, the Chinese Golden Dragon Acrobats and 
Magicians have appeared on "The Joan Rivers Show," "That's Incredible" and 
ABC's "Wide World of Sports."

 Known for its high-energy rock 'n' roll music, Craig & Company cranks it up 
Friday at the Westlake High School Theatre, 100 Lakeview Canyon Road, Westlake 
Village. Show times are 5 and 7 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The concert, headlined by Disney recording star Craig Taubman, is part of the 
Conejo Valley Children's Concert Series, sponsored by Conejo Valley Adult 
School and Radio AAHS. It's billed as a family concert with some jazz, rock and 
Latin tunes. Taubman is backed by a four-piece band. 
</P>
<P>
 Tickets are $5 in advance, or $6 at the door. Tickets are available at New 
Horizons in the Ralphs/Sav-On Plaza on Moorpark Road in Thousand Oaks, or at 
the Conejo Valley Adult School, 1025 Old Farm Road, Thousand Oaks. For

 Don't be surprised if you see a Boy Scout at your door Saturday. Scouts 
throughout the county will don their uniforms and collect canned food for needy 
families from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m.

 The Scouts' goal is to collect 50,000 cans -- 4,000 more than last year's 
drive. (They want only commercially canned food and dry goods -- no home-canned 
items.) 
</P>
<P>
 Each Scouting district will distribute the items to a food bank in its area. 
Among the organizations benefiting from the drive are Project Understanding in 
Ventura, HELP in Ojai, Community Assistance of Santa Paula, Fillmore Senior 
Center, St. Mary Magdalene Christian Service in Camarillo, Manna Food Bank in 
Thousand Oaks, Care and Share in Simi Valley and Moorpark Food Pantry.

REWIND; CHARLES BOYER IS MEMORABLE AS THE BAD GUY IN 'GASLIGHT'; INGRID BERGMAN 
IN AN OSCAR-WINNING ROLE AND A TANTALIZING AURA OF MYSTERY ALSO HELP TO KEEP 
THE 1944 FILM BURNING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Charles Boyer is probably best remembered as the quintessential Gallic 
heartthrob of the 1930s and '40s. 
</P>
<P>
 But Boyer may have turned in his most memorable performance when he played 
against his suave and romantic screen image in George Cukor's psychological 
mystery-drama, "Gaslight." In this 1944 film, the usually debonair Frenchman 
brings to chilling life the character of Gregory Anton, a manipulative and 
ruthless composer who tries to drive his naive wife Paula (Ingrid Bergman, in 
an Oscar-winning performance) insane. 
</P>
<P>
 When this Victorian period film opens, an underage Paula is in the process of 
moving out of her home in an upscale area of London. It is revealed that her 
aunt and guardian -- a revered opera singer -- has been murdered and that the 
girl is moving to Italy in an attempt to distance herself from that traumatic 
event and to further her own budding singing career. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten years later, Paula falls in love with Gregory. The couple quickly marry, 
and Gregory persuades his new bride to move back to the London estate that she 
inherited from her aunt. 
</P>
<P>
 But after the couple make the trip from Italy to England, Gregory's behavior 
suddenly turns cryptic and overbearing. He refuses to allow Paula to socialize 
and insists that she is becoming alarmingly forgetful and paranoid. 
</P>
<P>
 A virtual prisoner in her own home, Paula's vivacious spirit begins to wither. 
</P>
<P>
 What keeps "Gaslight" burning is its tantalizing aura of mystery. The question 
is, why is Gregory trying to drive Paula out of her mind? The clues arrive in 
bits and pieces, and eventually it is evident that Gregory has a secret past 
connected to Paula and her aunt. 
</P>
<P>
 "Gaslight," based on a play by Patrick Hamilton, is buttressed by three strong 
supporting performances. A fresh-faced Angela Lansbury is appealingly impudent 
as the housemaid; Dame May Whitty brings a comedic dimension to her role as a 
nosy neighbor, and Joseph Cotten has his moments as a well-bred fellow 
determined to get the bottom of the strange goings-on at the Anton residence.

REEL LIFE / FILM & VIDEO FILE; MOVIE PAIRS ROBBER, RABBI IN THE OLD WEST; 
JEWISH GROUP WILL SPONSOR A SHOWING OF 'FRISCO KID.' EVEN THE FAMOUS WYATT EARP 
HAD TIES TO THE RELIGION. 
</P>

<P>
 The United Jewish Appeal of Ventura County is promoting its Saturday screening 
of "The Frisco Kid" by describing it as a hilarious meeting of the Jewish 
tradition and the Old West. 
</P>
<P>
 The film (7:30 p.m. at the Ventura College theater) is about a Polish rabbi 
who befriends a bank robber. It sounds like a suitably implausible plot for a 
comedy, but the funny thing is, there were plenty of Jews in the Wild West. 
</P>
<P>
 Even that lately overexposed cinematic character, Wyatt Earp, ("Tombstone" and 
"Wyatt Earp") had a Talmudic tie-in. His last wife was Jewish. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's buried in a Jewish cemetery up near San Francisco," said Richard Erwin, 
a retired Ventura County public defender and author of a book titled "The Truth 
About Wyatt Earp." 
</P>
<P>
 The lawman's final repose is just down from jeans maker Levi Strauss and the 
ancestors of Barry Goldwater, the former senator from Arizona. Ironically, the 
grave marker for the Tombstone, Ariz., marshal was often stolen. But after it 
turned up at a San Jose flea market, it was returned to the cemetery and set 
flush to the ground in concrete. 
</P>
<P>
 Erwin is anxious to see Kevin Costner as the legendary lawman when "Wyatt 
Earp" is released in the summer. He said he loved "Tombstone," and pronounced 
the film historically accurate, except that in Hollywood every six-shooter 
seems to fire 15 bullets. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If Wyatt Earp in a Jewish cemetery isn't enough to demonstrate a blending of 
cultures, we offer this non-cinematic event: Temple Adat Elohim in Thousand 
Oaks is staging an Old West adaptation of the Purim story, the ancient tale of 
Jews surviving adversity in Persia. 
</P>
<P>
 The musical comedy titled, "The Great Robbery at Greenbaum Gulch," tells the 
story of Chief Mor-de-kai, medicine man of the Shushan tribe, who rescues the 
citizens of the gulch. The play and carnival are scheduled for Feb. 27 at the 
temple. For more information call 497-7101.

<P>
 UCSB has been recognizing Black History Month with a series of documentary 
shorts on the African American experience. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday the series features a profile of Joan Williams, an Oklahoma native 
who was part of the wartime migration from rural America to the urban 
manufacturing centers of the North. 
</P>
<P>
 Richly illustrated with archival photos, the documentary tells the story of 
one of the largest internal migrations in American from the perspective of 
Williams, a 77-year-old powder room attendant in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 On Feb. 22, the film "Straight Up Rappin' " features amateur rappers in New 
York performing unaccompanied raps about violence, drugs and homelessness. Both 
screenings will be at the UCSB Multicultural Center, Tuesdays at noon. For more 
information call 893-8411.

JAUNTS; HIKE TO THE HEIGHTS FOR VIEW FROM THE TOP; A PARK SERVICE RANGER ON 
SATURDAY WILL TAKE PARTICIPANTS TO THE HIGHEST POINT IN THE SANTA MONICA 
MOUNTAINS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Sandstone Peak is the highest point in the Santa Monica Mountains. If you want 
to see the view from the top, join a hike Saturday led by a National Park 
Service ranger. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, the hike isn't a straight shot to the top of the 3,111-foot peak, 
but rather about a six-mile circuitous route that also takes walkers into the 
canyons and wide-open spaces of Circle X Ranch. 
</P>
<P>
 The ranch is off Yerba Buena Road near the coastal border of Ventura and Los 
Angeles counties. Hikers should meet at the Backbone Trailhead at 9:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Led by ranger Jaquie Stiver, the jaunt is almost entirely over ground ravaged 
by fire late last year. However, that shouldn't stop hikers. The area has lost 
much of its eerie blackened look, and new, bright-green growth is sprouting 
along the trails and hillsides. 
</P>
<P>
 Circle X Ranch straddles Boney Ridge and offers the only spot where camping is 
allowed in the Santa Monica Mountains. Nearly 50 years ago, it was a working 
ranch owned by some gentlemen ranchers, including movie actor Donald Crisp, who 
starred in "How Green Was My Valley." 
</P>
<P>
 Then, in 1948, the Los Angeles-based Exchange Club purchased the 160-acre 
ranch and gave it to the Boy Scouts as a wilderness retreat. It gets its name 
from the emblem for the Exchange Club -- a circled X. 
</P>
<P>
 The Boy Scouts acquired more land over the years and, by the time Circle X 
Ranch became part of the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area in 
1989, it had grown to about 1,600 acres. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday's hike starts on the Backbone Trail, then, after one-third of a mile 
of climbing, veers off to the right onto the unmarked Mishe Mokwa Trail. Along 
the narrow trail, hikers will see a peculiar sight: charred spindly trees with 
peeling reddish bark. These are tree-like shrubs called red shank that normally 
grow between Palm Springs and northern Baja. 
</P>
<P>
 The climb into Carlisle Canyon takes walkers past some amazing red volcanic 
rock formations. Among them is the aptly named Balanced Rock -- a gigantic hunk 
of rock precariously balanced on a cliff. It looks as though a strong wind 
could blow it over. 
</P>
<P>
 The trail descends into a shady grove of oak trees known as Split Rock, named 
for the huge split rock nearby. A stream trickles through the grove and picnic 
tables make it a good place for a food break. 
</P>
<P>
 Be on the lookout here for hordes of ladybugs that cluster on stumps and tree 
trunks. "Last year, there must have been millions in huge clumps," Stiver said. 
</P>
<P>
 From Split Rock, hikers rejoin the Backbone Trail (actually a fire road), 
which takes them in a roundabout way to the turn-off for Sandstone Peak. Here, 
the climb is steeper and more rigorous, but it's only a short trek to the rocky 
summit where the Channel Islands are visible on a clear day. 
</P>
<P>
 Sandstone Peak is actually a misnomer because the peak isn't sandstone at all, 
but rather volcanic rock. And the plaque at the summit calls it Mt. Allen, 
after Circle X benefactor Herbert Allen. That's bogus too. The Boy Scouts tried 
to rename the mountain after Allen in the 1960s, but because he hadn't yet 
died, the request was denied. So the Boy Scouts unofficially named the peak 
after him. 
</P>
<P>
 At the top, hikers can sign an informal sort of register -- a weathered 
notebook that includes the musings of other hikers who made it to the top. "I 
have once again conquered the mountain," one wrote, only to be topped by 
another hiker who added: "Try Yosemite some time." 
</P>
<P>
 From Sandstone Peak, the hike back to the Backbone Trailhead is 1.5 miles, a 
drop in elevation of about 1,000 feet. Details 
</P>
<P>
 * WHAT: Santa Monica Mountains hike led by a National Park Service ranger. 
</P>
<P>
 * WHEN: Saturday, 9:30 a.m. Because of stops along the way, the hike of about 
six miles takes up to five hours. 
</P>
<P>
 * WHERE: Circle X Ranch in the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation 
Area. Take Yerba Buena Road, located off Pacific Coast Highway just north of 
the Los Angeles County line. Drive inland about five miles to the ranger 
station. Then drive one more mile to a parking area on the left, the location 
of the Backbone Trailhead where the hike begins. 
</P>
<P>
 * PHONE: (818) 597-9192. 
</P>
<P>
 * FYI: Bring water, food and wear sturdy shoes. Beware of poison oak and 
rattlesnakes.

EARTHWATCH: WHEN THE POWER GOES OUT, THERE ARE ALTERNATIVES; THE QUAKE BRINGS 
THE CONCEPT OF SUSTAINABILITY HOME. FROM GENERATORS TO FLASHLIGHTS, HERE'S WHAT 
TO LOOK FOR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD KAHLENBERG, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sustainability has become an important environmental concept, especially in 
business. The idea of getting by without over-dependence on outside resources 
can be seen in manufacturing and agriculture. In the steel industry, for 
example, more companies are recycling steel rather than depending on scarce 
ore, while newspapers such as this one are using more recycled newsprint 
instead of virgin stock. 
</P>
<P>
 The Northridge earthquake seems to have brought the concept of sustainability 
home to the consumer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody wants to be self-supportive," said Ron McKee, manager of a Home 
Base store in Simi Valley. He reports selling many home generators, "not mostly 
the little $300 ones for three or four bulbs, but more often the big ones at 
$800 that generate 3,500 watts." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, having your own generator isn't the perfect antidote to a power 
outage from a quake, fire or flood. You need gasoline. McKee recommends keeping 
a five-gallon supply near, but not in the generator, as petroleum left standing 
in a machine will gunk it up. He even recommends rotating the five-gallon 
gasoline stash regularly -- use it in the lawn mower and put fresh stuff in the 
container. 
</P>
<P>
 A product that gets closer to the sustainability idea is being marketed 
nationally by a local firm. Solarmode, in Oxnard, is marketing an emergency 
"preparedness kit" that provides electricity day and night -- from the sun. 
</P>
<P>
 Trevor Hewson, owner of Solarmode, didn't suddenly decide to capitalize on the 
quake; he's been selling "self-maintaining" equipment for years to camping and 
RV enthusiasts and homeowners who want to have electrical backup systems that 
don't require gas or batteries. 
</P>
<P>
 Hewson said his kit includes a compact photovoltaic solar panel, which sucks 
up the sun's energy even on overcast days; a power pack, which stores the 
resulting direct current in rechargeable batteries; an inverter, which converts 
the direct current to run your TV or appliances, and a pair of energy miser 
fluorescent lamps, which provide bright light for extended periods. 
</P>
<P>
 "I use a setup like this when I go camping -- for lights and the radio," 
Hewson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked how bulky this $300 kit is, he said it would fit into a shopping bag. 
Theoretically, with one of these rigs, you can enjoy a modicum of normalcy in 
your powerless home even if Southern California Edison took forever to repair 
the power lines. 
</P>
<P>
 For a less pricey dose of peace of mind -- and something so environmentally 
correct that you'll want to brag about it at Sierra Club meetings -- you might 
consider getting a Dynamo & Solar AM-FM receiver. With this $29 gizmo from Real 
Goods, a Northern California mail-order company, you can even survive a 
long-term solar eclipse. Just turn the crank for a minute to hear 10 minutes of 
disaster news. Or three minutes to hear an entire Beatles' album. Otherwise, 
pray for sun and when you get it, stick the radio in the window. 
</P>
<P>
 Real Goods has a wide selection of equipment that allows you to carry on a 
"sustainable" existence, including a mysterious thing called a Five Gallon 
Solar Shower. 
</P>
<P>
 My wife guessed that it must be something like the water-filled garden hose 
she used to leave lying in the sun to provide hot showers on camping tips. 
Indeed, the $12 Real Goods' item uses similar sustainable technology, but 
provides more showers at a time. 
</P>
<P>
 If you think shower talk is frivolous and beside the point, consider the 
results of my informal poll of local outlets of hardware chain stores. When I 
asked representatives from both Ace and True Value to tell me the No. 1 
post-quake-related purchase, they said it was equipment to reconnect or strap 
down home water heaters. 
</P>
<P>
 "Copper flex pipe became our hottest seller -- 2,000 a day," said Jeff 
Arenson, who monitors supplies for all True Value stores in our area. 
</P>
<P>
 Both chains report heavy post-quake sales in the appliance that is the perfect 
example of earthquake preparedness, sustainability and environmental 
consciousness: Black & Decker's line of flashlights that are kept plugged into 
a home electrical outlet for emergency use. 
</P>
<P>
 Each contains a battery that, because it is constantly being recharged, is 
always at the ready. In the event of a power failure, one model switches itself 
on so you can see where it is. Details 
</P>
<P>
 * FYI: Electrical products that make you energy-independent in the event of 
power blackouts are available at local Ace, True Value and Home Base outlets, 
also at Solarmode in Oxnard 382-8318 and Real Goods in Ukiah (800) 762-7325.

COVER STORY: ON WITH THE SHOW; OUR MAN GOES OUT ON THE DINNER-THEATER CIRCUIT 
AND COMES BACK WITH A HALF-BAKED STORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 The steak had traveled a distance. 
</P>
<P>
 When chicken arrived in its place, the server was dispatched upon a search. 
</P>
<P>
 But where? 
</P>
<P>
 Seats at the Ventura Concert Theatre filled for the Gregg Allman show and, 
down front, where folding tables form a makeshift dining area below the stage, 
noise and smoke and laughter formed a great blur. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here!" a flailing diner called out from two rows away. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here!" 
</P>
<P>
 Sure enough, he had the steak. It was surrendered -- passed overhead like a 
hot dog at the ballpark -- and arrived daggered with a Popsicle stick reading 
"medium well." 
</P>
<P>
 But medium rare was ordered. Oh, well. It's late. Sending it back to the 
kitchen would put things well into the darkness of a boisterous rock 'n' roll 
show -- and who knows how well that would go? What are the odds of finding 
one's server once an ear-crushing band takes the stage? 
</P>
<P>
 So goes the haute cuisine experience at the Ventura Concert Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
 You needn't eat here, of course. The place is a concert venue, not a 
restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 But the best seats in the house -- that is, the front third of the auditorium 
-- are reserved for those willing to fork out $20 or more for an entree, a beer 
and a tip. That's in addition to the concert ticket charge. 
</P>
<P>
 The hard truth? You need to eat here if you care about seeing the performance 
up close and intimate. For a couple taking the time to drive north from 
Thousand Oaks or Simi to hear Emmylou Harris, for example, another $40 ensures 
that all the trouble and planning are worth it. 
</P>
<P>
 It's an odd calculus, one that pairs concert-goers with food that is mediocre 
at best and at times downright disastrous. But the symbiosis is clear: Diners 
have the "opportunity" to buy a better seat, and the theater, by selling food, 
gets to exact a premium on those seats. 
</P>
<P>
 Enjoy that steak. 
</P>
<P>
 Two other venues in Ventura County -- Ottavio's Dinner Theater in Camarillo 
and Wheeler Hot Springs in Ojai -- serve food before performances. The level of 
the cooking in these two places well surpasses that of the Ventura Concert 
Theatre. But they still operate on largely the same premise: Eat and be 
entertained. 
</P>
<P>
 In the case of Ottavio's, which sells classic dinner theater, you have no 
choice: You dine or don't get to watch, say, Neil Simon's "Prisoner of Second 
Avenue." 
</P>
<P>
 Dining is somewhat easier here, as the dinner theater is related to the 
popular Ottavio's Italian restaurant on Ventura Freeway in Camarillo. But the 
buffet is not without its hazards and dislocations (see reviews that follow). 
</P>
<P>
 At Wheeler Hot Springs, special dinner/musical performance series are launched 
twice a week. While patrons are occasionally admitted to the performances at 
the very last minute, these events are designed as single dining/entertainment 
packages and require advance reservations. Dining here is easily best of all, 
for the Wheeler kitchen is in business on other nights as a fine restaurant. 
But it comes at a heftier price. 
</P>
<P>
 The choice by these three institutions to offer the combo deal is not an 
aesthetic one, though in some cases you may feel richly rewarded culinarily and 
culturally. 
</P>
<P>
 The choice, instead, is about money. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Marshall, Wheeler's general manager, is plain on the point. 
</P>
<P>
 "We used to make it optional, where you could come in for the show only," he 
said. "But often, we didn't sell enough dinners that way, and we couldn't make 
it. The shows just didn't pay for themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the shows don't come cheap. At Wheeler they are often top-shelf, the 
kind you would expect in the prime concert venues of Los Angeles or New York. 
Tenor saxophonist Joe Henderson is a case in point. 
</P>
<P>
 He appeared with a quartet recently, and the show, with a three-course dinner, 
was $50, wine and tip not included. The result: A couple, after buying a $30 
bottle of wine (optional), could expect to leave $160 on the table. At that 
level, you'd better be pretty happy with Wheeler's food as well as Henderson's 
sonic excursions. 
</P>
<P>
 The great American chef James Beard is credited with the line, "Food is 
theater." He was not, of course, invoking the purchase of hotel food as a way 
to see Tony Randall perform on the dinner theater circuit. 
</P>
<P>
 He was instead referring to the manner in which food and its preparation 
enchant: both the cook and the cooked-for. And the way it inspires good 
conversation. Food, and the behavior of those involved with it, was to Beard 
inherently dramatic. 
</P>
<P>
 Is it even possible, then, for food at the stage theater or food at the rock 
concert to rise to Beard's axiom? 
</P>
<P>
 While that would certainly be the best of all worlds, the truth is prickly: 
Tragedy and comedy -- as well as inspiration -- stalk meals in Ventura's combo 
houses. 
</P>
<P>
 For better and worse, they are among the prime cultural destinations in 
Ventura County. OTTAVIO'S DINNER THEATER 
</P>
<P>
 The doors open for dinner at 6:30 p.m., but don't expect to see food, in the 
form of a wan iceberg lettuce salad, until 7. This first half an hour, 
evidently, is get-acquainted time for you and your table mates -- and time 
enough to order a drink that is not included in the $25 package fee. 
</P>
<P>
 You will be assigned a table upon arriving and led to it. Be mindful of where 
the stage area is so that you don't seat yourself facing away from it. 
</P>
<P>
 It becomes immediately clear that the performance, at 8, is a long way off. 
</P>
<P>
 At 7, shortly after the salad arrives, there are two events: the arrival of 
hot, puffy dinner rolls and the introduction of two child singers who, as you 
negotiate huge croutons and excavate viscous ranch dressing from lettuce, croon 
Whitney Houston hits to prerecorded background music at ear-piercing levels. 
</P>
<P>
 All conversation is stopped; eight people around the table, drowned out by the 
sound, appear as if in a silent movie, chewing salad and carefully removing 
butter pats from gold-foil wrappings. It is only 7:15. Bon appetit.  
</P>
<P>
 Other tables are being called to the buffet, but yours is among the last in 
sequence. Finally, at 7:30, you face a bank of trays near the door where you 
first entered. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the woman who took your money at the door now faces you with a large 
steel serving spoon, suspended over the pasta tray, waiting for your cue as to 
which dish you'll try: chicken, engulfed in a heavy white cream sauce that goes 
blip-blip-blip in the pan; salmon filet beneath paper-thin lemon slices; pasta 
shells in tomato sauce with green peppers, and plain sauteed zucchini with 
oregano and other mixed Italian herbs. You'll try everything, thank you, 
carbo-loading for comfort, for survival. 
</P>
<P>
 The simplest is best: zucchini. It is firm, miraculously undercooked for the 
buffet, and extremely flavorful. The salmon hurts: It's dry, overcooked, and 
tastes as stale and metallic as it looks fresh and rosy, set off so wonderfully 
by all that fresh lemon. The shells in tomato sauce are acceptable, decent, 
safe -- nothing more, nothing less. Only the chicken breasts, cut into 
quarters, are cooked properly, but, alas, they are lost in cream sauce. 
</P>
<P>
 The singing has stopped. It is 7:50 p.m. Coffee and dessert arrive, and with 
it a palpable relief that one might finally recede from this banquet of 
strangers into semi-darkness and enjoy the magic of live theater. But curtain 
time doesn't seem, ever, to arrive. 
</P>
<P>
 And so for the next half an hour, you have plenty of light by which to 
excavate the kitschiest of Italian desserts, neatly balled and placed in a '50s 
Jell-O cup: pistachio and chocolate ice cream flecked with bits of 
fire-engine-red maraschino cherries, topped by a jagged spurt of canned whipped 
cream. 
</P>
<P>
 At 8:20, one hour and 40 minutes after arriving, the lights go down. And they 
do so much faster and more smoothly than dinner did. VENTURA CONCERT THEATRE 
</P>
<P>
 Timing is a problem at the Ventura theater. Pilgrims showing up for the big 
shows, billed for 8 p.m. kickoff, start lining up outside at 6 p.m. And the 
house will advise that you show up at that time if dinner is in your plans. 
</P>
<P>
 But the doors opened at 6:30, and we couldn't find a waitress till 7:10 p.m. 
When we did, we ordered a plate of nachos ($5.95), as listed on the menu, but 
were told, "You can't get those till after 8:30." 
</P>
<P>
 OK. Time to punt. 
</P>
<P>
 So we start with mozzarella cheese sticks ($5.95), slim, prefab tubules of 
flavorless cheese cloaked in unseasoned heavy batter jackets. The only thing 
they inspire are thoughts of a deep-freeze hotel supplier in Akron, Ohio. 
Sauteed mushrooms ($4.95), an unappealing, shiny brown pile of them, arrive 
entirely, and inexplicably, without flavor. Pass the salt; hello, blood 
pressure. 
</P>
<P>
 The steak ($13.95), after finding its rightful keeper, is overcooked, 
flavorless, leathery. The fish special is thresher shark ($11.95). While 
flavorsome, it is marred by a deep gash, dead center, the obvious mangling of 
an impatient chef who still got it wrong: The fish is raw in the center. 
</P>
<P>
 Curiously, both entrees are accompanied by impeccably fresh, perfectly cooked 
carrots -- at this point a joy and a mystery. The baked potatoes too, are firm 
and properly cooked, if small, and generously laden with sour cream and chives. 
Only the paper-dry dinner rolls match the entrees in haplessness: They haven't 
been sufficiently warmed back to life from whatever deep-cold storage space 
they were held in. 
</P>
<P>
 Minutes to show time, we seek solace in dessert, having left the dinners 
largely uneaten. Cheesecake ($3) is bland and, worse, frozen within. Apple pie, 
with decorative lattice crust on top, is a gluey, gooey supermarket version 
crowned with canned whipped cream. 
</P>
<P>
 Understand that realistic standards are being applied here. 
</P>
<P>
 A steak should have some flavor, fish should be cooked, cheese sticks should 
behave as if they were a dairy product, frozen pie should be thawed -- and 
nachos, unless specified otherwise on the menu, should be available when listed 
on the menu. 
</P>
<P>
 Patrons of our acquaintance insist there are ways to dine here and be happy. 
Teriyaki chicken ($10.95) gets high marks from most who order it, though our 
sample was under-flavored and awfully skimpy. 
</P>
<P>
 We're also told a reliable way to dine here is to keep things simple and just 
order the cheeseburger or chicken breast sandwich. Well, we'd love to. 
</P>
<P>
 But there's a horrible Catch-22: These selections, the menu makes clear, are 
served only after 8:30 p.m. Good luck getting dinner seating that late -- or, 
conversely, enjoy a burger at a concert nobody wants to attend. 
</P>
<P>
 By 9:30, when Gregg Allman finally takes the stage, you have rung up a tab of 
$45 per person, once the admission price is figured in. Blues music now takes 
on a new gustatory dimension. WHEELER HOT SPRINGS 
</P>
<P>
 Is there anyone among us who does not like to come here? 
</P>
<P>
 Perched above Ojai at the beginning of the Los Padres National Forest, the 
setting is rugged, original, remote, restorative, beautiful. The dining room is 
a quiet, elegant, yet somehow rough-hewn country space that soothes. And the 
food, under the sure hand of chef Gael Lecolley, has reached heights that 
deeply satisfy. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, pairing this with entertainment in no way guarantees success. 
</P>
<P>
 The timing could be all wrong. The food could be "special edition," or a 
scaled-down version lacking the polish and care of that offered from the 
restaurant's main menu. Table service might be less attuned to the diner's wish 
and instead fixated on maintaining a pre-performance schedule -- all in the 
knowledge that it's going to be a lousy tip night. 
</P>
<P>
 Happily, none of this comes to pass at Wheeler, which pulls off the 
dinner-entertainment combination with grace, aplomb and value. 
</P>
<P>
 The Celestial Trio, a fine harp/cello/flute confabulation from Los Angeles, 
anchored a recent Wednesday night classical series. Dinner seating commenced at 
6, though diners trickled in till 7 -- none of it mattering, since you run on 
your own clock. 
</P>
<P>
 While the food itself is not scaled down, menu choices are. The package price 
of $45 includes a menu of two choices in each of three courses, typically soup 
or salad, fish or meat entree, and one of two desserts. 
</P>
<P>
 Salad arrives in perfect shape: a mix of four different leaves, impeccably 
washed and dried and lightly dressed in a herbaceous vinaigrette. 
</P>
<P>
 A generously cut New York strip steak, pan-seared bistro-style, arrives 
perfectly cooked (medium rare) and set adrift in an amber moat of piquant 
mustard-cream sauce. 
</P>
<P>
 Surrounding the steak is an artful medley of fresh vegetables, all fanned out 
along the rim: asparagus tips, French miniature green beans, a hollowed tomato 
half-filled with pearl onions and potato balls of like size. More starch, you 
ask? Freshly baked rosemary rolls are accompanied by a fragrant, earthy, black 
slush of crushed Kalamata olives, olive oil and garlic. 
</P>
<P>
 Call it before-theater, before-concert, before-anything eating -- it is 
impressive. Only the dessert, a black currant mousse cake set off by tart fruit 
purees, fails to deliver in flavor what it did in dazzling visual presentation. 
</P>
<P>
 Wheeler, in being a prideful restaurant, has a terrifically drawn wine list. 
But the fairest values are in the full bottles, if you have enough in your 
party to drink one, as prices by the glass -- from $6 for an everyday Old Creek 
Merlot to $12 for a good-but-not-epic-vintage Heitz Cabernet sauvignon -- are 
gratuitously high. 
</P>
<P>
 If that's the only setback, we're still happy. The Wheeler package works so 
well.

SHOP TALK; FROM 'LOVE RINGS' TO LINGERIE; JEWELRY, CAMISOLES AND FLOWERS ARE 
ALWAYS SAFE BETS. BUT GO EASY ON THE CHOCOLATE. IT COULD BE HABIT-FORMING.

 Last week in this column, we were given valuable insight into what guys really 
want (and don't want) for Valentine's Day. Well this week, guys, we're here to 
help you find a pleasing offering for the woman in your life. Traditionally, 
Valentine gifts fall into four categories: jewelry, chocolate, lingerie and 
flowers. All wonderful. But take a closer look. JEWELRY 
</P>
<P>
 No. 1 one on the list of the love-struck and the greedy. The Museum Shop in 
The Oaks mall has "love rings" reproduced from those found in London's Victoria 
and Albert museum. These simple bands are engraved with a poem or a sentence 
perfect for Valentine's Day. One says Vous et nul autre (that's French for "You 
and no other" -- swoon). Another says "Think of me" (a little less of a 
commitment but still sweet). The rings come in silver ($45) and gold ($250). 
</P>
<P>
 Also at The Oaks, but thinking we were at Tiffany's, we greatly admired the 
"Silver Collection" at Ann Taylor's. These necklaces and earrings are $35 to 
$50 and look a lot like jewelry designed by Paloma Picasso. CHOCOLATE 
</P>
<P>
 Your lady may love it, but unless she's a waif model she might not love you 
for it. Also, some of us can't stop at one or two pieces, we just want more and 
more. Pretty soon we're fat and miserable. Current research has it that 
chocolate releases a chemical in the brain that closely resembles the same 
chemicals released when falling in love. You don't want your girlfriend falling 
in love with a Whitman Sampler, do you? LINGERIE 
</P>
<P>
 Probably a man's favorite gift to shop for, especially from a catalogue! But 
deals aren't often found in catalogues. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's a couple of ground rules for lingerie shopping. First, get the size 
right. It's simple. Just look in her drawers and check out those tags. There. 
Now you know. 
</P>
<P>
 Second, resist the red. Department stores and lingerie shops have red 
displayed everywhere this month. But most women prefer the more tasteful shades 
of white or champagne. 
</P>
<P>
 Last, if you don't know what it is, don't buy it. Weird or complicated garter 
belts and merry widows do not make women smile. A simple camisole or teddy will 
be more happily received. 
</P>
<P>
 LFL (Lingerie for Less) has opened a new store in Oxnard. They have a helpful 
sales staff so don't be afraid to ask for assistance. Unfortunately, we were 
asked not to name brand names, but we did spot a few designer labels usually 
found only in the better department stores. All of their merchandise is 
discounted and there are lots of items on sale, too. We saw short, silk boxers 
for $9.99 and lots of teddies for $14.99. FLOWERS 
</P>
<P>
 They can be costly, but flowers are romantic, they're beautiful to look at and 
they can make a room smell great. The Flower Show in Thousand Oaks has a 
Valentine Special on roses. For $39.95, plus a $5 delivery charge, they will 
send a dozen roses in a vase or a box. That's about 10% to 35% cheaper than 
other florists we called. 
</P>
<P>
 If your finances do not allow for such frivolity, don't despair; not all women 
equate romance with large cash expenditures. The most romantic gifts do not 
require a bank account. Write a poem. A love letter. Serenade her at work. A 
walk on the beach or a handmade valentine will be greatly appreciated. Details

FASHION; A DECENT PROPOSAL STILL MEANS THE GUY BUYS A DIAMOND RING; SOME THINGS 
NEVER CHANGE. USUALLY A SOLITAIRE STILL FOLLOWS THAT ROMANTIC VALENTINE'S DAY 
REQUEST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 St. Valentine's Day is a time for plighting troths. This Monday, not a few 
local males will choose a romantic setting (such as a damp beach), where they 
will lead their true loves to a peaceful spot (like a rotting log), and say 
things that will profoundly affect their futures. And then, they will present 
these women with diamond rings which cost enough to finance a full-range home 
stereo or a modestly priced motorcycle. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a tradition. 
</P>
<P>
 And one that won't go away. Women may have changed the national language to 
equalize their status with males, won the right to compete on the playing field 
and in the workplace -- but many don't seem ready for equality in wedding 
jewelry. 
</P>
<P>
 When the pledge of love is made, the preferred token to seal it is the 
solitaire diamond, say local jewelers. And men tend to stretch their budgets to 
get the best they can. 
</P>
<P>
 "A guy is not going to take his wife a $200 ring," said Mike Maralian, 
president of Dejaun Jewelers in Westlake and Thousand Oaks. "He will come in 
and spend $1,500 or $2,000 or $3,000. Even if they are hurting, they will put 
it on a credit card." 
</P>
<P>
 These days, this special purchase will most likely be a single ring instead of 
an engagement and wedding set. And if not a solitaire, it will be in a simple 
setting, Maralian said. 
</P>
<P>
 Once more common were "very busy-looking settings -- a couple of round stones, 
a couple of marquises, a couple of baguettes; there was too much happening," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 With a single stone, the trend is to get a larger diamond, and more often than 
in the past, a cut that is other than round, such as an emerald or oval shape. 
</P>
<P>
 Once accepted, the jewel will be worn throughout the engagement, then taken 
off before the wedding, and presented again in the ceremony. Or, just before 
the wedding, the stone will be removed from its setting and set in a wider 
band, which becomes the wedding ring. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes a short mating ritual takes place in selecting the ring. The 
intended, with prior knowledge of the intention, visits the store alone, 
chooses a diamond in her partner's price range, and departs. The next day, the 
man enters with the ring's specifications, buys it, and orders it wrapped as a 
gift. 
</P>
<P>
 But even in the '90s it is more common for a man to buy the ring to surprise 
his intended, jewelers said. Most of the time, it works out. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't hear, 'Oh, I hate it, let's get something else,' " said Richard 
Koven, manager at Hart's Jewelers in Thousand Oaks. "I very rarely get an 
engagement ring returned -- and that's when (the woman) didn't accept (the 
proposal)." 
</P>
<P>
 Less often, said the jewelers we spoke to, couples choose a ring together, and 
few, but no more than 10%, go with just matched bands for the wedding, no ring 
beforehand. 
</P>
<P>
 You mean none of them go for that stereo with Dolby surround, or put the cash 
toward a condo? 
</P>
<P>
 Even in second marriages, these options get thumbs down. 
</P>
<P>
 Diamonds, it seems, are forever. 
</P>
<P>
 We asked a dozen women who have become engaged or married in the last year if 
they wore an engagement ring, and why. According to theory, 1.2 of them should 
have been bare-fingered until the wedding. None was. 
</P>
<P>
 They said they could not imagine being engaged without a ring. 
</P>
<P>
 "It makes it seem more real," said Tina Mahler of Ventura, who works as a bank 
loan specialist. "Like, 'Oh, yeah, we're engaged, but we don't have a ring.' 
'So, you're engaged? How do you know that?' " she said. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't just the stone that charmed them. They told of romantic presentation 
scenes. 
</P>
<P>
 Sandra Downard of Ojai, a cashier at Community Memorial Hospital, said her 
fiance, David Graves of Ojai, drove up to the hospital in a horse and carriage 
and proposed in front of her co-workers. 
</P>
<P>
 An evening campfire with friends set the scene for Nathan Dodge of Port 
Hueneme to offer a ring to then Melissa Roper, a property manager from Ojai. 
</P>
<P>
 The most common ploy for getting a diamond into a woman's hands was wrapping 
it as a Christmas present in an oversized box, then proposing when it emerged 
from the wrappings. Christmas beats even Valentine's Day as an occasion for 
declaring love, merchants said. 
</P>
<P>
 All of the women we interviewed had friends who were recently engaged; they 
reported each couple made it official with a diamond ring. 
</P>
<P>
 "In my office alone, six people have gotten married," said Kelly Ray of Simi 
Valley, who was married last fall. "They are all professional women out in the 
real world," said Ray, a project manager in environmental planning. "Some of 
them you wouldn't think would; but they got (rings)." 
</P>
<P>
 In the name of equality, at least one groom, Ray Sosa of Oxnard, suggested to 
his bride, Leticia, a personnel manager at a cosmetics firm, that the betrothal 
custom be extended to include men. 
</P>
<P>
 "He used to tell me, 'You're a woman of the '90s -- where's my ring?' " said 
Leticia. 
</P>
<P>
 Supporting our findings that the tradition isn't ready to erode, Leticia 
dismissed this request with a time-honored reply, one that traditionally has 
ended many a discussion between the sexes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told him, 'Don't be silly,' " she said.

RESTAURANT REVIEW; SUSHI FIT FOR BUCK ROGERS; THE JAPANESE EATERY IN THOUSAND 
OAKS HAS AN APPEAL THAT WILL STAND THE TEST OF TIME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HILARY DOLE KLEIN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES

<P>
 In Japan thousands of soba shops concentrate on serving only buckwheat noodles 
and broth to their patrons. Another type of specialty restaurant is the tofu 
ryori , places where all items on the menu, from appetizers to desserts, have 
been imaginatively concocted from tofu. In Kyoto you can eat at a tofu ryori 
that has been in the same family for 300 years. 
</P>
<P>
 I tried to imagine the Tempura House in Thousand Oaks 300 years from now. The 
Evergreens shopping center would be a late-20th-Century relic, the whole area 
possibly covered by a biosphere dome. People might even tele-transport 
themselves to the restaurant by the touch of a button. 
</P>
<P>
 The decor here could easily hold its aesthetic appeal for 300 years. Beautiful 
Japanese prints and works on paper grace the walls. Paper lanterns and bamboo 
shades hang from the ceiling, giving tables the illusion of separation. They 
have the Japanese knack for creating a sense of privacy out of very small 
spaces. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the Japanese do like to concentrate on a single food, that is not what 
the Tempura House has done with tempura. In fact, the best part of the 
restaurant isn't even the tempura; it's the sushi bar. 
</P>
<P>
 However, most of the menu items are paired with tempura, batter-fried 
combinations of vegetables and fish -- and if you like crispy, greasy food, 
you'll love the tempura here. 
</P>
<P>
 The prices are quite reasonable, $4.50 to $7 at lunch for generous meals 
served on cute compartmentalized plastic trays. Entrees came with rice and 
pickled vegetables and a crisp salad with a pleasantly slurpy dressing that had 
a hint of toasted sesame and a nice wedge of pineapple on the side. 
</P>
<P>
 For dinner, among other choices, they offer giant boats filled with food for 
$12 to $15. 
</P>
<P>
 I had the tempura with teriyaki chicken, which had a thick, sweet-tasting 
sauce with a hint of plum flavoring. The tempura had a thick crust and seemed 
more starchy than veggie, with both white and sweet potatoes, fat button 
mushrooms and yummy onions. 
</P>
<P>
 I have had more elegant and spectacular Japanese food, but there was an 
appealing sense of Japanese home cooking here, food that is simple, with a 
minimum of frills. Miso soup for instance came perfectly plain, a cloudy broth 
with no additions. 
</P>
<P>
 In a subtle broth of its own, udon , or white noodles, serenely overflowed 
their bowl, topped with plain, boiled root vegetables. A very basic kind of 
meal. Donburi was a homey dish of somewhat clumpy rice and chicken with a 
slightly sweet taste. Pairing it with the sunomono , thin sliced cucumbers in 
vinegar, improved it. 
</P>
<P>
 An appetizer special of soft-shelled crab from the sushi bar was astoundingly 
good, crisp and soft in just the right places. It directed my attention to the 
small sushi bar, where I discovered that the sushi was fine, but the specials 
concocted by the sushi chef were really delightful. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbecued mushrooms with seafood were delicious. No discernible barbecue 
flavor, just marvelous floppy mushrooms with bite-sized pieces of seafood in a 
spicy cream sauce. 
</P>
<P>
 Scallops with garlic were cooked in a buttery garlic sauce and served, also 
with mushrooms, on a lovely white shell. Another special, bonito sushi , doused 
with vinegar sauce, was meltingly good. They do especially fine sushi rolls 
here, including a very tasty California roll and a Westlake roll with tuna, 
yellowtail and avocado, a slam dunk winner. 
</P>
<P>
 It all came together spectacularly with the soft-shelled crab roll, where the 
added textures of rice and seaweed enhanced the pleasures of the wonderful 
fried crab. It was both crisp and chewy, with a subtle interplay between sweet 
and salty that was marvelous. 
</P>
<P>
 If they can still make a dish like this 300 years from now, all will be right 
with the world. Details

 Lack of a paper trail leading to the decision to fire Jim Huffman, and 
unconvincing testimony from some defense witnesses proved most costly to Cal 
State Fullerton, according to jurors who awarded the former Titan volleyball 
coach $1.35 million in damages Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Jurors, who were allowed to discuss the wrongful-termination case for the 
first time Wednesday, said they did not believe school administrators' claims 
that the decision to fire Huffman was based on job performance or was made in 
the fall of 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffman's attorneys argued that the firing on March 23, 1992, was in 
retaliation for Huffman's gender-equity lawsuit that blocked the school's 
attempt on Jan. 28, 1992, to drop volleyball, forced athletic department policy 
changes and embarrassed the school. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was waiting for the defense to come up with some documentation for when the 
decision to terminate was made," said Lori Horwitz, a clinical social worker 
from Orange. "There has to be minutes from meetings or a definite date. This 
was a major decision, but they couldn't give a day or a week that it was made. 
That was key." 
</P>
<P>
 Jury forewoman Angela Williams, an Orange resident and news assistant for the 
Orange County Register, said she noticed distinct differences in witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
 "The plaintiff's witnesses gave evidence that backed their story, their 
testimony was clear, glowing and made without hesitation," she said. "With the 
defense witnesses, there was a lot of pausing, a lot of them asked, 'Can you 
repeat the question?' and there was a lot of changing stories. 
</P>
<P>
 "We felt Cal State Fullerton really did (Huffman) wrong, and the school didn't 
have any real strong evidence to back their reasons for firing him." 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton Athletic Director Bill Shumard, deemed by the jury to be most 
culpable of the defendants, held firm in his belief that he didn't retaliate 
against Huffman. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was shocked at the verdict," Shumard said Wednesday. "The amount was way 
out of line." 
</P>
<P>
 Huffman was awarded $350,366 in damages for projected financial losses and $1 
million for damages caused by emotional distress. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't put a price tag on what (Huffman) had to pay for standing up for 
what's right," Horwitz said. "He lost his job, his identity, he suffered 
physical problems, mood shifts, anxiety and an overall loss of self-esteem." 
</P>
<P>
 Shumard and Jack Bedell, former university vice president for academic 
affairs, are also liable for punitive damages, both for having "acted with 
reckless disregard of, or callous indifference to," Huffman's First Amendment 
rights, and Shumard for having acted with "fraud, malice or oppression." 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys for Huffman and the school said the issues of how punitive damages 
are decided, and their amount, if awarded, will be kept confidential. While 
Tuesday's judgment would come out of the Cal State University system's 
operating budget, Shumard and Bedell would have to pay any punitive damages 
assessed to them. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorney Kevin Gerry said he will file two motions, one to set aside 
the verdict and another for a new trial. A hearing to act on those motions and 
decide payment of court costs -- Huffman's attorney fees have risen to more 
than $200,000 -- would likely be held within a month, Gerry said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the verdict is excessive, and I plan to attack it through post-trial 
motions," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Shumard said if Gerry's motions are denied, the school would likely appeal. 
But such a move could be even more costly; Huffman's award would begin earning 
7% interest from now until the appeal date. 
</P>
<P>
 Shumard also said he had no intentions of resigning in light of the verdict. 
</P>
<P>
 "Considering all the key people in the decision (to terminate Huffman) have 
always been on the same page in regards to the decision, I would doubt (there 
would be repercussions)," Shumard said. "This is part and parcel to being an 
administrator, and I'm trying to keep that perspective on it." 
</P>
<P>
 Shumard acknowledged that the two-year legal battle with Huffman and Tuesday's 
verdict have put a strain on his relations with the athletic department, but 
he's confident he will recover. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm anxious to put this behind us and, for better or worse, move forward," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffman's attorneys hailed the verdict as a victory for coaches who stand up 
for gender equity, but one women's sports advocate would like to see these 
battles move from the courtroom to the athletic director's office. 
</P>
<P>
 "The verdict sends a good message, but we need to stop forcing the issue in 
court and start forcing it in athletic departments," said Elizabeth Toledo, 
state coordinator for the National Organization for Women in Sacramento. 
"Athletic departments need to embrace gender equity. Everyone would save a lot 
of money, and we'd have much healthier institutions."

HARDING SUES USOC; FIGURE SKATING: A $20-MILLION LAWSUIT FILED IN OREGON SAYS 
SHE SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO COMPETE IN OLYMPICS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Signaling an all-out battle to retain her place on the U.S. figure skating 
team, Tonya Harding filed suit late Wednesday to block the U.S. Olympic 
Committee's impending hearing on her eligibility. Her suit also demanded $20 
million in damages. 
</P>
<P>
 The 16-page lawsuit asked for a temporary restraining order and a preliminary 
injunction to stop the USOC's scheduled hearing Tuesday in Oslo. This hearing 
was likely to be Harding's last hurdle in her quest to represent the United 
States at the Winter Games along with rival skater Nancy Kerrigan. 
</P>
<P>
 Harding's suit was filed by her defense team in the Portland suburb of Oregon 
City, at the Clackamas County Court. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney Robert Weaver said the out-of-the-way court was chosen because 
Clackamas County was Harding's last permanent residence. He said he expected a 
hearing today. 
</P>
<P>
 "She will take the ice and make everyone proud," Weaver said. 
</P>
<P>
 One Oregon legal scholar, who asked not to be named, suggested there may be 
another reason in choosing that location: The possibility of finding a more 
sympathetic judge in the community where Harding has trained and had become a 
local celebrity long before her ex-husband arranged the Jan. 6 attack on 
Kerrigan. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, legal experts have been saying for days that the hearing in 
Oslo opens the USOC to charges that it is rushing too fast to guarantee Harding 
due process. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked by the Associated Press if the lawsuit meant Harding would not appear 
before the hearing of the USOC's Games Administration Board in the event it 
proceeds, Weaver said: "We're going to exhaust this first and see where it 
goes." 
</P>
<P>
 The foundation of her lawsuit is Harding's insistence that she has complied 
with all rules and regulations of the U.S. Figure Skating Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit said the hearing does not provide adequate due process because 
Harding wasn't given adequate notice of specific charges; the time and place 
for the hearing made it difficult for Harding to attend; and the hearing was 
not set before impartial fact finders. 
</P>
<P>
 It said that Harding was denied the right to call witnesses and cross-examine 
them; that the USOC failed to provide an appeals procedure and written notice 
of one; and that Harding was denied the right to a fair hearing before the 
USFSA and was put in jeopardy twice for the same alleged misconduct. 
</P>
<P>
 It also claims the USOC interfered with Harding's rights as a figure skating 
association member. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit was filed half an hour before the court closed, meaning it was the 
middle of the night in Norway, where USOC officials were preparing for the 
hearing and Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
 Harvey Schiller, USOC executive director, told the AP that the committee had 
expected some action by Harding's attorneys. "We are prepared to defend 
ourselves," Schiller said. He declined further comment until USOC reviewed the 
suit. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the immediate questions: Would the USOC honor a state court injunction? 
Is the committee sobered by the lawsuit's demand for $20 million in punitive 
damages? 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile in Portland, Harding's ex-husband and chief accuser, Jeff Gillooly, 
filed a motion in Multnomah County Court seeking permission to travel to Norway 
and testify at the USOC hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials asked that Gillooly travel to Norway and testify regarding his 
contention that Harding was involved in planning and approving the Kerrigan 
attack almost from the beginning. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of his request, Gillooly also asked the court to release to him 
results of a lie-detector test he took as part of his guilty plea in the case. 
His lawyer said Gillooly wanted to take the results to Norway and present them 
"if requested." 
</P>
<P>
 Three other men are awaiting indictment in the attack, but Harding has not 
been charged. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue before the USOC's committee is reportedly more about sportsmanship 
and fair play than the unresolved criminal case. In particular, the focus of 
Olympic authorities is Harding's admission that she misled investigators -- and 
the public -- about attempts to cover up the crime. USOC officials said the 
hearing would give Harding an opportunity to explain her actions. 
</P>
<P>
 Gillooly wants to go to Oslo to try to right some of the many wrongs that have 
been done in this crime, said his attorney, Ron Hoevet. "He wants to cooperate 
with the USOC's fact finding in an attempt to mitigate the injury he and others 
have caused Nancy Kerrigan and her family," Hoevet said. 
</P>
<P>
 A judge was to hear arguments on the motion late today. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors, meanwhile, said they would not reach a conclusion on the pending 
criminal investigation until after the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
 A grand jury investigating the crime was extended in Portland until March 21. 
Deputy District Atty. Jean Maurer told a judge that most of the investigation 
could be wrapped up this week, but that Harding's cooperation is necessary to 
bring the work to an end. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has become obvious to us that her continuing cooperation will not be 
possible at least until after the Olympic and (U.S.) figure skating association 
proceedings involving her are completed," Maurer said. 
</P>
<P>
 By means of selective interviews, Harding is continuing her campaign for 
public support. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview with the tabloid TV show "Inside Edition," Harding reflected 
on her difficult childhood, tensions with her mother and her desire to make 
enough money so she will never again have to scrape or sell her car or rely on 
others. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never really had a family. . . . I've always wanted to have somebody there 
who loved me and cared for me," she told an interviewer for the program, which 
is to be aired tonight. A transcript provided by producers of the program 
contained no questions about the facts of the case. 
</P>
<P>
 A CBS interview with Harding is also scheduled for airing tonight. An advance 
transcript quotes the skater reflecting on the cyclone of controversy now 
swirling around her. "I can't let this ruin me. I've worked too hard, too long, 
20 years."

NICKLAUS RETURNS TO RIVIERA; GOLF: HE HAS NEVER WON ON THE COURSE, BUT HE WILL 
BE IN SPOTLIGHT AS L.A. OPEN BEGINS TODAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Jack Nicklaus is still The Man at Riviera Country Club. 
</P>
<P>
 It was obvious from the time he stepped out of the clubhouse to make his way 
down the hill to the driving range. Autograph seekers shoved pens and scraps of 
paper at him and cameras snapped at every turn as longtime golf fans welcomed 
him back to Riviera. 
</P>
<P>
 Fred Couples, Tom Kite, Tom Watson, Payne Stewart and U.S. Open champion Lee 
Janzen are among the favorites in the 144-man field of the $1-million Nissan 
Los Angeles Open that starts today. 
</P>
<P>
 But Nicklaus will get most of the gallery's attention when he tees off at 
11:47 a.m., making his 11th appearance in the tournament but first since 1985. 
</P>
<P>
 He won't come out and say this will be his last time in the L.A. Open, nor 
will he make any promises about playing in it again after this week. 
</P>
<P>
 When pressed, Nicklaus, who celebrated his 54th birthday last month and has 
been playing professional golf since 1962, says he doesn't even know for sure 
how much longer he'll continue to play. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, I will always play in some senior major events because I think the tour 
needs my support," he said Wednesday, "but when I talk about playing some more, 
I'm talking about the regular tour. That's the only one that really matters to 
me." 
</P>
<P>
 And when he's talking about the regular tour, he is really talking about the 
major championships, because that is what Jack Nicklaus is all about. 
</P>
<P>
 Nicklaus has won 18 of them, 20 when two U.S. Amateurs are included, but none 
since the Masters in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 "The majors have always been my top priority," he said. "They always will be. 
I can't change that. That's just me. I will never be a player who accepts an 
invitation to play in a major just to play in it. If I don't believe that I can 
compete, then there's no sense in playing." 
</P>
<P>
 Nicklaus, who is making his third tournament appearance this year, said he is 
trying to get his game ready for the majors by playing in more early-season 
events. 
</P>
<P>
 He was encouraged by his play when he won the Seniors Mercedes Championship at 
La Costa, but he missed the cut last week at Pebble Beach, where he shot rounds 
of 74, 73 and 73. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't play very well," he said, "but it was expected. It was just a little 
bump in the road. I'm not going to know how well I can play unless I play in a 
lot of tournaments. The way I play in these tournaments, and in the majors this 
year, will tell me if it's worth it to keep playing." 
</P>
<P>
 Nicklaus entered 10 PGA Tour events and six senior tour tournaments last year. 
He had three top-10 finishes on the senior side, but only one -- a 10th at 
Doral -- on the regular tour. 
</P>
<P>
 That's not a bad record, but below the standard Nicklaus expects of himself. 
</P>
<P>
 His sights have always been set high, beginning with his U.S. Amateur 
victories in 1959 and '61. 
</P>
<P>
 His first pro victory came in a major, the 1962 U.S. Open at Oakmont Country 
Club in Pennsylvania. 
</P>
<P>
 Nicklaus' first tournament at Riviera was in 1973 when he finished sixth at 
280, four shots behind Rod Funseth. It was to be the first of his many 
frustrating experiences at Riviera. 
</P>
<P>
 He often played well enough to contend, but there was always somebody having a 
better week. 
</P>
<P>
 Pat Fitzsimons won the only tournament of his life at Riviera in 1975, beating 
runner-up Tom Kite by four shots and Nicklaus by five. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Gil Morgan's year to shine in 1978. Nicklaus shared the lead with four 
holes to play, but double-bogeyed the 15th and bogeyed the 16th. Morgan beat 
him by two strokes. 
</P>
<P>
 The only other time he had a chance to win the L.A. Open was in 1984, but 
David Edwards shot a 64 on the final day to defeat Jack Renner by three and 
Nicklaus by four. 
</P>
<P>
 And Nicklaus was runner-up to Hal Sutton in the 1983 PGA Championship at 
Riviera. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's been typical of the way things have always been for me at Riviera," 
Nicklaus said. "I've had some pretty good rounds here, but never four that were 
good enough to win." 
</P>
<P>
 Although he isn't among the favorites this week, Nicklaus knows what can 
happen if he should get into contention early. "I think I still know what to do 
if I get in that position," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, if 46-year-old Johnny Miller can win at Pebble Beach without 
practicing, it shouldn't be that much of a shock if golf's all-time greatest 
player comes through for the first time on one of golf's greatest courses. 
</P>
<P>
 Golf Notes 
</P>
<P>
 The pros are still talking about Johnny Miller's victory last week at Pebble 
Beach. "It was unbelievable," said Fred Couples, a two-time winner at Riviera. 
"I can't imagine anybody winning without playing for a year. If I came into 
this event after taking a year off, I would have an airplane reservation for 
Friday night. You know, that just shows you what a great player he really was. 
He could always hit the ball better than anybody else. And I don't care what he 
says, he must be able to putt. But I know he has had some bad knees and there 
have been times when he just couldn't play, period." 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Kite said: "I think it's ironic that Johnny Miller won, because he's been 
up in that ivory tower (on TV) telling everybody that you can't win after 40. 
He probably surprised himself that he had a pulse. I didn't get to watch him 
because I was playing with runner-up (Tom) Watson, but Miller had to be playing 
well because Watson was hitting every shot solid." 
</P>
<P>
 Ted Oh, 17, is one of two amateurs in the field. The other is Chris Tidland.

COUNTDOWN TO THE WINTER OLYMPICS / LILLEHAMMER '94; BUT CAN THEY FORGET?; 
WHETHER GOOD TIMES OR SAD, BLAIR AND JANSEN IGNORING PAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY HARVEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Another Winter Olympics, another gold medal or two for Bonnie Blair? Another 
Winter Olympics, another 16 days of despair for Dan Jansen? 
</P>
<P>
 History leads us to wonder if that again will be the theme for U.S. 
speedskaters in the competition at Hamar's Olympic Hall, a unique indoor arena 
designed to resemble an overturned Viking ship. 
</P>
<P>
 But although their Olympic moments could not be more different, both Blair and 
Jansen are determined not to dwell on the past. The only time Blair looks 
behind her is to see who is gaining, and even though no one has passed her for 
any significant length of time, she imagines hordes of Chinese, South Koreans 
and Germans on her heels. Jansen looks only one way, straight ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 That was the lesson he learned two years ago, when he was constantly reminded 
in interviews about the death of his sister, Jane, of leukemia on the morning 
of his first race in the 1988 Winter Games at Calgary, Canada.  
</P>
<P>
 It was a story told over and over to a sympathetic worldwide television 
audience: He skated hours later in the 500 meters, fell, returned to the ice 
four days later in the 1,000, the day he would return home for the funeral, and 
fell again. 
</P>
<P>
 A gold-medal contender in both races four years later in the Winter Olympics 
at Albertville, France, Jansen was haunted by the memory of his sister, or at 
least by the relentless questions about her death, and further impeded by 
slushy track conditions, he finished fourth in the 500 and an embarrassing 26th 
in the 1,000. 
</P>
<P>
 At a news conference earlier this winter, Milwaukee Journal columnist Michael 
Baumann began a question with, "Dan, you've won everything in speedskating but 
one thing . . ."  
</P>
<P>
 Interrupting, Jansen good-naturedly asked: "And what would that happen to be, 
Mike?" 
</P>
<P>
 Jansen, 28, has taken that approach in all interviews this winter, deflecting 
any attempts to discuss past Winter Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
 "On race days, I know what I have to do, whereas before I would go into races 
maybe too relaxed," he said during the recent U.S. Olympic trials in Milwaukee. 
"I still go into races relaxed, but it has to be aggressive relaxation." 
</P>
<P>
 Were you too relaxed, he was asked, in 1992? 
</P>
<P>
 "No," he said, "but let's not talk about '92." 
</P>
<P>
 His coach, however, will talk about it. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not looking at it like we did in '92, when we said we're just out here 
to compete and do the best we can, while in the back of our minds we were 
thinking we wanted to win a medal," said Peter Mueller, American gold medalist 
in the 1,000 meters in 1976.  
</P>
<P>
 "This time, we're not fooling ourselves, saying one thing and thinking 
something else. I've put a lot of pressure on D.J. in the last six months. 
We're telling people we want to win that medal. If we don't win, well, life 
goes on. But that's definitely our focus." 
</P>
<P>
 The approach has worked so far. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first major international competition inside Hamar's Olympic Hall last 
December, Jansen became the first man to skate 500 meters in under 36 seconds, 
breaking the barrier twice on the same weekend.  
</P>
<P>
 It could be argued that his historic times were attributable to the fast track 
in the Viking Ship, a multipurpose facility that designers joke is adaptable 
for every sport except ice fishing. Particularly suitable for speedskating, 
seven world records have been set there in the last two months. 
</P>
<P>
 But Jansen has been fast on every track this winter. Two weeks ago in the 
world sprint championships at Calgary, he again lowered the record, to 35.76 
seconds. He also has skated impressive times in the 1,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's mentally better than I've ever seen him," Mueller said. "I think he 
knows this is his last Olympics, and he knows what he wants to do." 
</P>
<P>
 So does Blair. 
</P>
<P>
 She has her sights set on a three-peat as the gold medalist in the 500 and a 
repeat in the 1,000. But that is only because she always wants to win and not 
because her fourth and fifth gold medals would distinguish her as the United 
States' most decorated female Olympian. U.S. women with four gold medals are 
track sprinter Evelyn Ashford, swimmer Janet Evans and diver Pat McCormick. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess those are things you guys think about," she told reporters this 
winter. "I can't really think about that because if I start thinking about 
that, that's going to take away from trying to accomplish what I want to do out 
there. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that's one of the reasons I've had the success I've had: Concentrate 
on that race at that time. That's all you can think about." 
</P>
<P>
 After winning two gold medals in 1992, Blair, 29, thought age might be 
catching up with her when she did not dominate the sprints last year. But she 
changed coaches, from Mueller to former sprinter Nick Thometz, and that has 
revitalized her. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's been doing the same thing for so long that motivation can be a 
problem," Thometz said. "I've tried some different things with her. I think 
it's been a plus." 
</P>
<P>
 Blair plans to compete through next year. Asked if 30 is too old to race, she 
said: "Oh, no. No, no, no." 
</P>
<P>
 If she has any regret about her career, it is that she has been so focused, 
she has not had time for a life outside it. She has a boyfriend, speedskater 
David Cruikshank, but they are noncommittal when asked about marriage plans. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've probably struggled with that more this year than anything else," she 
said. "Put everything aside, go to the rink, come back and eat lunch, lie on 
the couch, go back to the rink again and do whatever your next workout is, come 
back home, eat dinner, watch TV, go to bed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I see my friends running around with kids. Everything has changed for them, 
and I'm still the same." 
</P>
<P>
 One close friend she envies is Jansen, who has been able to successfully blend 
his career with his family life. Last year, he and his wife, Robin, had their 
first child, a daughter. They named her Jane, for his late sister.

JIM MURRAY: HE WON'T LET LABOR OF LOVE GO BY BOARDS

<P>
 They are our best athletes. They run faster, jump higher, throw farther. 
There's not an ounce of fat on them. They work out, eat right. They don't 
smoke, chew, swear or drink. Their bodies are their temples. 
</P>
<P>
 They don't need a team to do what they do, or a car, a club, a racket, 
although they might need a pole. Some of them perform barefoot. 
</P>
<P>
 They are track and field stars, and by all rights they should be the most 
celebrated of performers if athletic prowess is the criterion. 
</P>
<P>
 They're not. They're a hard sell. 
</P>
<P>
 Just ask my friend, Al Franken. 
</P>
<P>
 Al has been trying to sell track, keep it alive as a viable sport in this part 
of the country for more than 40 years. He will be putting on his 35th annual 
Sunkist track meet at the Sports Arena on Feb. 19. Many of the people who will 
be in the 1996 Olympic Games will be there. 
</P>
<P>
 A track tradition was once paramount in this part of the country. It was a 
legacy of the great USC teams with sprinters Charley Paddock, the original 
"world's fastest human," and Mel Patton, and the great shotputters like Parry 
O'Brien who put the sport on Page 1. The Olympics were wrested away from Europe 
by track-crazy local promoters. 
</P>
<P>
 Franken is almost the last of them. It hasn't been easy keeping the tradition 
alive. The proliferation of pro sports has passed it by. If you're not carrying 
or hitting or kicking or dunking a ball, if you're not getting several million 
dollars a year for standing out in the field blowing bubble gum, you may be an 
athlete but you're not a star. Your autograph is not worth several thousand 
dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 It saddens Franken. Forty years ago, it was nothing for the Coliseum Relays to 
attract 40,000 to 50,000 paid customers. Next week, he might have trouble 
filling the Sports Arena with 13,500. "It's partly the earthquake," he laments. 
"They see the pictures of the Coliseum and think the Sports Arena is in the 
same shape. It isn't." 
</P>
<P>
 For Al, keeping the sport alive has always been a labor of love. "Lord knows, 
you can't get rich," he grimaces. 
</P>
<P>
 He got infected in the early days of the old Compton Relays, a now-defunct 
sporting event that used to have some of track's finest moments. 
</P>
<P>
 Keeping track on life-support since hasn't been easy. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we started the indoor Sunkist meet, we had one big problem -- no track," 
Franken says. "So, we contacted Ollie Kuechle, the sports editor in Milwaukee, 
where they had an indoor track, and he agreed to lend us theirs if we promised 
to return it and didn't bust it up. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was all well and good, but to fit it in the truck, we had to leave off 
part of it. We left off the long jump runway. Which was fine -- except we had a 
field full of long jumpers. 
</P>
<P>
 "For a while, it didn't seem as if it would matter anyway. The truck got lost. 
Or at least, the driver took a few detours. We had a sold-out house, an Olympic 
field -- and no track. It finally arrived the afternoon of the meet. Guys were 
running on it at one end and guys with hammers were finishing it up at the 
other." 
</P>
<P>
 The troubles were not always material. Tracksters sometime got lost, too. The 
great Bob Beamon, the first man (and for 25 years the only man) to jump farther 
than 29 feet, had trouble making the meet because he forgot where he'd parked 
the rental car Franken had provided for him. 
</P>
<P>
 Franken recalls: "I said, 'Well, Bob, where are the keys?' and he said, 
'Keys?!' He had forgotten where he left the car. I had visions of the daily tab 
running up and up till it would have been cheaper buying the car, till we 
finally found the car in a parking lot in San Diego. The next year, I told Bob, 
'Take a cab, even from San Diego, it'll be cheaper.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Track was relentlessly amateur in those days. "I got suspended for life three 
times," Franken says bemusedly. The AAU once flew out an official (Olan 
Cassell) to meet a plane on which the African miler, Kipchoge Keino, was 
arriving, and to tell him he had to turn around and go back, that he would be 
suspended if he ran in Franken's meet. Keino laughed. And ran. 
</P>
<P>
 The cast of characters in his meets -- two indoor meets and an outdoor at UCLA 
-- read like a Track Hall of Fame roster. The great milers -- Peter Snell, 
Filbert Bayi, John Walker, John Landy, Wes Santee, Ron Delany -- ran here. 
</P>
<P>
 "You paid them off in pocket money," Franken recalls. "Santee used to get 
extra airline tickets and cash them in. Wilma Rudolph was the biggest 
attraction we ever had here. She had just won three gold medals in the Rome 
Olympics, and the fans literally broke down the doors trying to get in to see 
her. We had to sweep up the glass. She cost me a plane ticket. Then, my wife, 
Shirley, took her shopping and bought her a jacket. You would have thought we 
bought her the Hope diamond. Wilma came from a family of 20 kids and she hadn't 
been in too many Saks Fifth Avenues." 
</P>
<P>
 The Frankens used to have to house the athletes in their home in the early 
days -- paying for a hotel room was out of the question. "I would have got 
suspended for two lifetimes," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 There were disappointments. "We got Lasse Viren, the great Olympic distance 
runner (who won the 5,000 and the 10,000 in two Olympics in a row)," Franken 
says. "We moved the event from night to afternoon for ABC. But he never even 
finished his race!" 
</P>
<P>
 Valeriy Borzov, who had won the Olympic sprints at Munich in '72, came out for 
a meet -- and didn't survive the heats! 
</P>
<P>
 Some athletes wouldn't survive the trip. "You'd get a call saying the runner 
was stranded in Lisbon -- he'd missed his plane. I can't tell you how many 
times I went out to the airport to pick up a runner, only to watch everybody 
get off the plane but him." 
</P>
<P>
 Was it worth it? "Oh, yeah," Franken concedes. "They were a colorful bunch. 
You had to educate them to the realities of promotion of track in America. In 
their home countries, they were big idols. Here, they were faces in the crowd. 
In Europe, track was second only to soccer. The TV rights to the world track 
meet sold for $45 million. And that's only the European rights. 
</P>
<P>
 "I used to deal direct with the athletes. Now, you deal with agents who are 
unrealistic. You have to remember track was big -- but that was before we had 
two major league baseball teams, two NFL football teams, two NBA basketball 
teams and two NHL hockey teams, to say nothing of two big-time college football 
and basketball programs." 
</P>
<P>
 Franken had to pay Canada's Ben Johnson $35,000 in under-the-table funds for 
his (unsuccessful) "comeback" try after his steroid banishment. He ran as 
unevenly as he was to run at Barcelona in the 1992 Olympics. Johnson, off 
steroids, couldn't catch a bus. 
</P>
<P>
 "People say they love sports," Franken claims. "How can there be any purer 
sports than a guy -- or a girl -- who runs faster or jumps farther than anyone 
on the planet?" 
</P>
<P>
 They buy the hype. They buy the contact, dig the violence. Sometimes, I think 
the only track meets in history that broke the charts were the ones where the 
Christians tried to outrun the lions. 
</P>
<P>
 It might be a hard sell, Franken acknowledges. But in his view, it beats field 
goals, intentional bases on balls, bunts. Foot-faults. And free throws.

GOOD RIPS; HALL OF FAMERS SCOFF AT JORDAN'S CHANCES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As Michael Jordan took batting practice in Chicago, several baseball Hall of 
Famers threw brush-back pitches Wednesday at him and his career change. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd say he's got two chances: slim and none," Ralph Kiner told the Citrus 
County Chronicle before dedication ceremonies Wednesday for the Ted Williams 
Retrospective Museum and Library."And slim is going out the door. If Ted 
Williams were his teacher I'd say he has a chance, but he's got Walt Hriniak, 
and I don't think Walt Hriniak knows what he's talking about when it comes to 
hitting." 
</P>
<P>
 "On a scale of one to 10 with 10 being the highest, I'd say he's a one," Al 
Kaline said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Feller, who won 266 games and threw three no-hitters, said Jordan 
"couldn't hit a curveball with an ironing board." 
</P>
<P>
 Feller suggested that signing the former Chicago Bull star to a minor league 
contract was probably a ploy by the White Sox. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he's a great basketball player and a great athlete," Feller said. 
"But if (the White Sox) were serious about it, they would have had him in an 
instructional league this winter. They will sell some tickets, though."

COLLEGE BASKETBALL / GENE WOJCIECHOWSKI; NEVER TOO EARLY TO TAKE THAT ROAD TO 
THE FINAL 64

<P>
 At absolutely no charge to the NCAA basketball committee, which will make its 
tournament seedings and at-large selections on March 13, we offer this 
midseason cheat sheet of the eight conferences that matter: PACIFIC 10 
</P>
<P>
 SURE THINGS: UCLA, California, Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
 PROBABLE: Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
 MAYBES: Arizona State, Washington State. 
</P>
<P>
 BEST PLAYER: Jason Kidd, Cal guard, aspiring center fielder. Runner-up: Ed 
O'Bannon of UCLA, who can make his presence known in any game. Kidd, however, 
can dominate them. 
</P>
<P>
 BIGGEST DISAPPOINTMENT (TEAM): USC. Hello, NIT . . . if the Trojans are lucky. 
</P>
<P>
 BIGGEST DISAPPOINTMENT (PLAYER): Until last week, it was Washington State's 
Mark Hendrickson, who has since picked up his game. In truth, there are no real 
flops in the conference. 
</P>
<P>
 COACH OF THE HALF-SEASON: Very tough call. Our picks: (1) Todd Bozeman, Cal; 
(2) Bill Frieder, Arizona State; (3) Jim Harrick, UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 COACH FOR THE REST OF THE SEASON: Jim Anderson, Oregon State. Don't be 
surprised if you hear Drake Coach Rudy Washington's name as a possible 
replacement. ATLANTIC COAST 
</P>
<P>
 SURE THINGS: North Carolina, Duke. 
</P>
<P>
 PROBABLES: Virginia, Maryland, Wake Forest. 
</P>
<P>
 MAYBES: Georgia Tech, Clemson, Florida State. 
</P>
<P>
 BEST PLAYER: Grant Hill, Duke, who edges North Carolina center Eric Montross. 
</P>
<P>
 BIGGEST DISAPPOINTMENT (TEAM): Georgia Tech. The Yellow Jackets had four 
quality starters back, started fast and have since become the league's most 
inconsistent team. 
</P>
<P>
 BIGGEST DISAPPOINTMENT (PLAYER): Martice Moore, Georgia Tech, ACC rookie of 
the year in 1993 and ACC no-factor in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 COACH OF THE HALF-SEASON: Gary Williams, Maryland. The Terrapins already have 
matched last season's 12 victories and are on the way to their first NCAA 
appearance since 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 COACH FOR THE REST OF THE SEASON: Cliff Ellis, Clemson. BIG TEN 
</P>
<P>
 SURE THINGS: Michigan, Indiana, Purdue, Wisconsin, Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
 PROBABLE: Illinois. 
</P>
<P>
 MAYBE: Michigan State. 
</P>
<P>
 BEST PLAYER: Glenn Robinson, Purdue forward. Runner-up: Alan Henderson, 
Indiana forward. 
</P>
<P>
 BIGGEST DISAPPOINTMENT (TEAM): Minnesota. Coach Clem Haskins wants respect, 
but the Golden Gophers aren't going to get it until they start winning on the 
road. 
</P>
<P>
 BIGGEST DISAPPOINTMENT (PLAYER): Lawrence Funderburke, Ohio State. A 
13.7-point average isn't exactly what the Buckeyes had in mind. 
</P>
<P>
 COACH OF THE HALF-SEASON: Steve Fisher, Michigan. No Chris Webber. No bench. 
At one point, no Jimmy King and Juwan Howard because of chickenpox. And last 
weekend, no King and Ray Jackson because of shoplifting problems. Still, the 
Wolverines are 16-4 and headed toward a conference title. 
</P>
<P>
 COACH FOR THE REST OF THE SEASON: Paul Swanson, Northwestern assistant. Or 
until Ricky Byrdsong returns from his indefinite leave of absence. BIG EAST 
</P>
<P>
 SURE THINGS: Connecticut, Syracuse. 
</P>
<P>
 PROBABLES: Boston College, Pittsburgh, Georgetown. 
</P>
<P>
 MAYBE: Providence 
</P>
<P>
 BEST PLAYER: Donyell Marshall, Connecticut. Marshall leads the conference in 
scoring average (25.9 points) and blocks (3.2), and is second in rebounding 
(9.6). 
</P>
<P>
 BIGGEST DISAPPOINTMENT (TEAM): Miami. No one else is close. 
</P>
<P>
 BIGGEST DISAPPOINTMENT (PLAYER): Steve Edwards, Miami. He's averaging only 9.4 
points, nearly seven off his freshman average. 
</P>
<P>
 COACH OF THE HALF-SEASON: Paul Evans, Pittsburgh. Picked to finish ninth in 
the conference, the Panthers probably will wind up third, go to the NCAA and 
make it very difficult for the Pitt administration to fire Evans, who has been 
in semi-hot water for years. 
</P>
<P>
 COACH FOR THE REST OF THE SEASON: Miami's Leonard Hamilton. The Hurricanes won 
seven conference games last season but are zero for '94. SOUTHWEST 
</P>
<P>
 SURE THINGS: Texas, Texas A&M. 
</P>
<P>
 PROBABLE: Nobody. 
</P>
<P>
 MAYBE: Baylor. 
</P>
<P>
 BEST PLAYER: B.J. Tyler, Texas point guard. He leads the conference in 
scoring, steals and three-pointers and is second in assists. Runner-up: Jerome 
Lambert, Baylor forward. 
</P>
<P>
 BIGGEST DISAPPOINTMENT (TEAM): Houston. Phi Slamma Jamma has become We Lose A 
Lotta. The Cougars lost 13 consecutive games until a victory over Rice last 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 BIGGEST DISAPPOINTMENT (PLAYER): Willie Sublett, Baylor forward. Although he 
averaged 15.1 points as a junior and 12 as a senior, he has lost his starting 
job--but not his sense of humor. Baylor fans, weary of watching Sublett foul 
out--he averages 3.4 whistles a game--bring a sign that reads: "Willie, don't 
foul." With each foul, they insert the appropriate number. When it reaches 
five, they replace it with, "See ya!" Sublett doesn't mind. He autographed it. 
</P>
<P>
 COACH OF THE HALF-SEASON: Tony Barone, Texas A&M. 
</P>
<P>
 COACH FOR THE REST OF THE SEASON: Moe Iba, Texas Christian. The Horned Frogs 
were 6-22 last season and are struggling in '94. Legendary name or not, he 
needs some victories. BIG EIGHT 
</P>
<P>
 SURE THINGS: Missouri, Kansas, Oklahoma State. 
</P>
<P>
 PROBABLES: Oklahoma, Nebraska. 
</P>
<P>
 MAYBE: Kansas State. 
</P>
<P>
 BEST PLAYER: Melvin Booker, Missouri guard. The Tigers recruited Booker as 
something of an afterthought. Four years later, he is a solid star. 
</P>
<P>
 BIGGEST DISAPPOINTMENT (TEAM): Nebraska. Even with four starters back, the 
Cornhuskers have lost to Appalachian State and, before Wednesday's victory over 
Kansas State, had lost four consecutive conference games. 
</P>
<P>
 BIGGEST DISAPPOINTMENT (PLAYER): Anthony Beane, Kansas State guard. Known for 
his clutch play a season ago, Beane is a mess in '94. The ugly numbers: 29.7% 
shooting, and 88 assists vs. 67 turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
 COACH OF THE HALF-SEASON: Mr. Personable, Missouri's Norm Stewart. 
</P>
<P>
 COACH FOR THE REST OF THE SEASON: Joe Harrington, Colorado. Hanging on . . . 
barely. SOUTHEASTERN 
</P>
<P>
 SURE THINGS: Arkansas, Florida, Kentucky. 
</P>
<P>
 PROBABLES: Alabama, Mississippi State. 
</P>
<P>
 MAYBE: Louisiana State. 
</P>
<P>
 BEST PLAYER: Corliss Williamson, Arkansas forward. "One of the best players in 
the paint, pound for pound, inch for inch, in college basketball," Kentucky 
Coach Rick Pitino said. Runner-up: Wesley Person, Auburn swingman. 
</P>
<P>
 BIGGEST DISAPPOINTMENT (TEAM): Georgia. All five starters returned and 
Bulldogs have a 10-11 record to show for it. 
</P>
<P>
 BIGGEST DISAPPOINTMENT (PLAYER): Jason Caffey, Alabama forward. An all-SEC 
selection last season, Caffey can't be found among the league's top 20 scorers 
or top 10 rebounders. He also can't be found in the lineup. Alabama recently 
suspended him for academic "irregularities." 
</P>
<P>
 COACH OF THE HALF-SEASON: Lon Kruger, Florida. America now knows what his 
peers realized for years: Kruger, whose Gators are 19-3, is one of the best in 
the business. 
</P>
<P>
 COACH FOR THE REST OF THE SEASON: Tennessee's Wade Houston and maybe Auburn's 
Tommy Joe Eagles. The rumored Tennessee replacement list includes Marquette's 
Kevin O'Neill, Western Kentucky's Ralph Willard, Massachusetts' John Calipari 
and Cincinnati's Bob Huggins. GREAT MIDWEST 
</P>
<P>
 SURE THINGS: Marquette, Alabama Birmingham, St. Louis, Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
 PROBABLE: None. 
</P>
<P>
 MAYBE: DePaul. 
</P>
<P>
 BEST PLAYER: David Vaughn, Memphis State forward. Runner-up: Erwin Claggett, 
St. Louis guard. 
</P>
<P>
 BIGGEST DISAPPOINTMENT (TEAM): Memphis State. Still, it has too much talent to 
miss the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 BIGGEST DISAPPOINTMENT (PLAYER): A tie between Deuce Ford, Memphis State 
freshman guard, and Chip Hare, Dayton forward. 
</P>
<P>
 COACH OF THE HALF-SEASON: Charlie Spoonhour, St. Louis. The Billikens were 
picked to finish sixth in the seven-team conference. Instead, they're 19-1 and 
ranked 17th in the country. Runner-up: UAB's Gene Bartow. 
</P>
<P>
 COACH FOR THE REST OF THE SEASON: Jim O'Brien, Dayton. The Flyers are bombing. 
THE SPIN DOCTOR 
</P>
<P>
 Earth to Texas Tech Coach James Dickey, come in, please. 
</P>
<P>
 Only a few days removed from the postgame melee that saw Tech fans confront 
visiting Texas A&M players, Dickey now says the incident "has been completely 
blown out of proportion." 
</P>
<P>
 Let's see: Texas A&M players had to jump chairs to escape the first wave of 
the Tech crowd. Then, without a security escort, they had to run a gantlet of 
more angry Tech fans, some hurling debris, to say nothing of profanity and 
racial slurs. Then, as the Aggie players tried to make their way through the 
tunnel, several Tech fans got into a shouting and shoving match with A&M Coach 
Barone and Barone's son, Tony Jr. That's when Aggie forward Joe Wilbert decked 
one of the fans. After that, the Aggies ran for their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Dickey is right: Sounds as if a few Red Raider fans simply were having some 
good, clean fun. 
</P>
<P>
 The ugly scene has made the ESPN and CNN rounds, prompting this response from 
Dickey, who might want to invest in a pair of glasses: "(Raycom's) angles of 
the camera were quite different from some other shots. Unfortunately, that's 
the feed that got out." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Barone Sr. knows what he saw. "I think that our players were 
scared," he said. "Yeah, it was a scary situation." THE LAST WORD 
</P>
<P>
 Kentucky's Pitino, on the Wildcats' victory over Massachusetts at East 
Rutherford, N.J. on Sunday: "They announced (a crowd of) 18,000 and 
change--18,000 for UMass and change for Kentucky." Top 10

TURNER, NEVER ONE TO TURN DOWN A SHOW, IS BACK ON THE SHORT TRACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY HARVEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the 1992 Winter Olympics, a U.S. speedskater won as many medals as Bonnie 
Blair. But Cathy Turner's came in short-track speedskating, an addition to the 
official program that did not receive as much attention as the long-track 
version. 
</P>
<P>
 The hyperactive Turner, however, does not sit still anywhere for long, 
particularly not in anyone's shadow. A former pop singer, who composed an 
autobiographical single called "Sexy, Kinky Tomboy," she took a year off after 
winning gold and silver medals in 1992 to become the first speedskater to star 
with the Ice Capades. 
</P>
<P>
 She also did endorsements for two major companies, a bodybuilding infomercial 
and a fitness video called, "Legs, Legs, Legs." 
</P>
<P>
 She posed for a billboard that was unveiled this month above New York's Times 
Square. 
</P>
<P>
 And she got married. 
</P>
<P>
 But when it came time for speedskaters to get ready for the season leading up 
to the 1994 Winter Olympics, the 31-year-old Turner was among them. Again 
establishing herself as a medal contender, she proved she belonged by setting 
U.S. records in the 500 meters and 1,000-meter time trial in December. 
</P>
<P>
 Not joining in her celebration were several other U.S. female speedskaters, 
who resented that she was able to take a year off and come back to take one of 
their Olympic berths. 
</P>
<P>
 Did she care? 
</P>
<P>
 "They're not my best friends, let's put it that way," she said. RANDY HARVEY

WINTER OLYMPICS / NOTEBOOK

<TEXT>
<P>
 Downhill ski racers are a strange breed and don't deny it. 
</P>
<P>
 While the rest of the world looks forward to the Olympics, you suspect some 
skiers almost consider it a nuisance -- merely the most crowded stop on a 
whirlwind European tour. 
</P>
<P>
 Luxembourg's Marc Girardelli, one of the greatest ski racers ever, has long 
maintained that winning Olympic gold is not important to him. 
</P>
<P>
 Coincidentally, perhaps, he has not won a gold medal. 
</P>
<P>
 AJ Kitt, the veteran U.S. downhiller, tried to explain the concept to 
reporters in a news conference to preview Sunday's first Alpine event, the 
men's downhill. 
</P>
<P>
 The race is expected to attract 38,000 spectators. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you want to be remembered as a great ski racer, be renowned with your 
peers, win Kitzbuehel (Austria) or Wengen (Switzerland)," he said. "If you want 
to be remembered by everyone else, win the Olympics." 
</P>
<P>
 The meat-and-potatoes portion of ski racers' careers, the World Cup circuit, 
is largely ignored outside of Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 The racers contend that the only time anyone cares about them is Olympic time. 
When Kitt finished ninth in the 1992 Albertville Games, a relatively pleasing 
result to him, people came up to console him. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The death of Ulrike Maier on Jan. 30 still weighs heavily on international 
skiers. The Austrian star died after crashing on the downhill course at 
Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 Kitt concedes that danger is part of the sport and is of the opinion that 
course safety has greatly improved in recent years. He was critical, though, of 
the placement of a timing post on the Garmisch course. Maier's head struck the 
post. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to make sure that never, ever happens again," Kitt said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kitt was relieved that a men's downhill, scheduled at Garmisch four days after 
Maier's death, was canceled. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would have been hard to go 80 m.p.h. past that part of the course, and not 
think about what happened to Ulrike Maier," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, Paul Major, the U.S. Alpine director, said Maier's death 
will not make his skiers skittish. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not so much the safety," Major said. "They're shaken more because of the 
death itself. She was a star of the sport, a mother, a great person, too. 
That's the shocking part. But the racers are not looking at the course going, 
'Where am I going to fall and hurt myself.' " 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Major said there was no serious discussion about leaving Diann 
Roffe-Steinrotter off the U.S. team. 
</P>
<P>
 Roffe-Steinrotter, the 1992 Olympic giant slalom silver medalist, has 
struggled since the Albertville Games and ranks 30th in the current World Cup 
GS standings and 60th in the World Cup overall. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's scored across the board in GS and super-G," Major said. "Not great, but 
she could pop one at any time. . . . She just hasn't put it together yet, but 
the one that counts hasn't come yet." CHRIS DUFRESNE

 The U.S. bobsled team, which has not competed internationally since early 
December and had been conducting trials and training in Calgary since Jan. 11, 
left Canada for Norway on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Three drivers -- Brian Shimer, Jim Herberich and Randy Will -- advanced from 
the trials, but only two will compete in the Olympics, based on a final 
competition here. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. federation, familiar with controversy, has apparently put some behind 
it, rejecting appeals by drivers Chuck Leonowitz and Bruce Rosselli that the 
trials were invalid and should be repeated. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosselli, an alternate here, claimed that equipment was taken from his sled 
and used on a competitor's. Leonowitz claimed that he was unable to participate 
in the push phase because of medical reasons and maintained that the federation 
was notified before the deadline. ROSS NEWHAN

WINTER OLYMPICS / NOTEBOOK; NO ONE'S STOPPING NORWAY'S ULVANG FROM CRITICIZING 
THE IOC

 The hot rumor Wednesday, entirely unsubstantiated, was that Vegard Ulvang, 
Norwegian cross-country skiing hero, would not be allowed to recite the Olympic 
oath, as scheduled, on behalf of all the athletes at Saturday's opening 
ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
 Ulvang has frequently been critical of the International Olympic Committee and 
its president, Juan Antonio Samaranch, and repeated those criticisms Tuesday on 
Norwegian television. 
</P>
<P>
 Ulvang said that Samaranch, a former minister in Spain's Franco regime, which 
he described as fascist, was hardly a worthy representative of international 
sport. He also said democracy was lacking in the IOC. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the rumors, reaction was bland. Sandy Napier, spokesman for the IOC, 
said Ulvang's comments showed he had little knowledge of Samaranch or the IOC 
and that the organization was far more democratic than it was a decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ulvang is most welcome at IOC or the IOC Athletes' Commission to meet and 
talk about this," Napier said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lillehammer Olympic Organizing Committee said Ulvang was free to voice his 
opinions and that his statements were not a problem.

 Figure skater Nancy Kerrigan, who had not planned to march in the opening 
ceremony, apparently has changed her mind. 
</P>
<P>
 Marit Rasmussen, the LOOC's figure skating consultant in nearby Hamar, said 
Kerrigan would attend the opening ceremony and was a potential flag bearer for 
the U.S. team. MIKE KUPPER

 With appropriate fanfare and popping flashbulbs, Norway's King Harald and 
Queen Sonja appeared at the official opening of the Main Press Center here.  
</P>
<P>
 "The Main Press Center is perhaps the heart of the Games," said Gerhard 
Heiberg, president of the LOOC."We do not pump out blood into the body, but we 
pump out information to the world."

 The U.S. hockey team was scheduled to arrive today and practice tonight at 
Hakon Hall, site of its tournament opener Sunday against France. Indications

Dunham's struggles in the past month. 
</P>
<P>
 Dunham made 23 saves in a 2-2 tie against Sweden in Goteborg, Sweden, on 
Wednesday, the final exhibition for the United States. David Roberts and Jeff 
Lazaro scored for the Americans.

Quebec is "a strange town."

 "Bare stomachs, bare arms and unnecessarily bare skin."

<P>
 What about them? 
</P>
<P>
 They "will not be permitted" in Olympic figure skating, one of the judges said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Sigrun Morkeseth, a skating judge from Norway, said rules have been tightened, 
and competitors can lose points if judges consider their costumes to be 
indecent. Female skaters must always wear skirts, and no fringes on costumes 
will be tolerated. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Morkeseth singled out no individual, German skater Katarina Witt's 
costumes have been criticized by some as unduly provocative. Also, Tonya 
Harding's costume at the recent U.S. Championships was sleeveless, bare in 
front from armpit to armpit and exposed in a deep V almost to the waist. 
Although she won the competition, published reports claimed that Harding's 
scores were lowered by certain judges because of her costume.

 According to Greg Crouch, press attache from the U.S. Embassy in Oslo, the 
First Lady has not yet decided which events she will attend. He said Mrs. 
Clinton has expressed interest in speedskating and Sunday's men's downhill, and 
he expects her to attend the hockey game between the United States and France.

 Ram defensive tackle Sean Gilbert was sentenced to a year's probation on Jan. 
27 after pleading guilty to lesser charges for his involvement in an 
altercation with an off-duty police officer last March 24 in Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
 Gilbert, 23, pleaded guilty to simple assault and resisting arrest.He was 
originally charged with aggravated assault, resisting arrest, disorderly 
conduct and obstructing a passageway. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Pittsburgh police, Gilbert and University of Pittsburgh football 
players Reuben Brown and Jonathon McCray blocked a woman from leaving a 
restaurant. Gilbert and the players then scuffled with off-duty police officer 
David Proctor, who was hired as a security guard at the restaurant, police 
said. Proctor was hospitalized with a back injury in the incident. 
</P>
<P>
 Gilbert earned All-American honors at Pitt in 1991. He led the Rams with 10 
1/2 sacks and was named a Pro Bowl starter. MIKE REILLEY

CHICK HARRIS TO REPLACE ZAMPESE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE REILLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Chick Harris, who groomed Jerome Bettis as the Rams' tailback this past 
season, was named the team's offensive coordinator Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Harris, Ram running back coach for two seasons, replaces Ernie Zampese, who 
left last week to become the Dallas Cowboys' offensive coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
 Harris will continue to coach the running backs in his new capacity. 
</P>
<P>
 His philosophy is suited to Coach Chuck Knox's ground-oriented offense, 
although Harris promises a balanced attack. "As far as our offense is 
concerned, we're not going to be Ground Chuck or Ground Chick," Harris said. 
"We're going to take the best of what has been accomplished here under Ernie 
and what we have done on the ground the last two years." 
</P>
<P>
 He takes over an offense that ranked 23rd in the NFL in passing (174.4 yards a 
game) and fifth in rushing (125.9 yards). Under Harris' guidance, Bettis rushed 
for 1,429 yards, second in the league behind Emmitt Smith's 1,486. 
</P>
<P>
 Harris, 47, originally joined Knox's staff in Buffalo in the 1981-82 season. 
He coached the offensive backfield under Knox with the Seattle Seahawks in 
1983-91 before joining the Ram staff in '92. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams are in the process of giving two-year contract extensions to their 
current assistant coaches, indicating that the team plans to honor the final 
two seasons of Coach Chuck Knox's four-year contract.

SMASHING SUCCESS; WEBER OVERCOMES A DOWNER AND MAKES PUMPING IRON AN UPLIFTING 
EXPERIENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF FLETCHER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Funny how life -- and 70-pound dumbbells -- can come crashing down on you. 
</P>
<P>
 Braden Weber was pumping iron, happily building himself into a bigger and 
better basketball player, when his life took a temporary wrong turn. 
</P>
<P>
 Four-and-a-half months ago, Weber, a forward for St. Francis High, 
accidentally smashed his right middle finger between two weights, leaving the 
tip of the finger dangling, ready to drop off at any moment. 
</P>
<P>
 Four hours of emergency surgery later, Weber had his finger back. Today, it 
looks a little funny, Weber said, but it is fully functional. 
</P>
<P>
 The functions his fingers have performed best lately are dunking basketballs 
and clutching rebounds for St. Francis (19-5, 10-1 in Del Rey League play), 
which is ranked eighth in the state in Division III and needs a victory Friday 
at Pius X to clinch a share of the league title. 
</P>
<P>
 At 6-foot-8 and 225 pounds, Weber has powered his way to 13.1 points and 11.2 
rebounds a game, both team highs. Weber relies not only on his size, but 
strength as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's by far the strongest person I've seen on a high school basketball 
court," said teammate Bret Christoffersen. "He's not easy going against in 
practice." 
</P>
<P>
 Added Coach John Jordan: "If he goes up for a rebound, 99 times out of 100, 
it's his." 
</P>
<P>
 Weber wasn't always so strong, though. When he first came to St. Francis, he 
was tall and scrawny, Jordan said. He didn't play much until this season 
because of 6-6 forwards Jaasen Pruett and Dave Craig, both unanimous all-league 
selections as seniors last season. 
</P>
<P>
 But Weber, a senior, knew this season would be his chance to start and to 
shine. So he went into the weight room, lifting for an hour at a time three or 
four times a week during the off-season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've seen a big difference in my game since I've been lifting," Weber said. 
"I've gained about 20 pounds. Going up for a rebound, you always have a bunch 
of people clinging to you, and (the extra muscle) helps to push them off." 
</P>
<P>
 Late last September, Weber was doing dumbbell inclines -- lying on his back at 
an angle, head pointed toward the floor, lifting a pair of 70-pound dumbbells 
over his body. When he finished, rather than placing them down gently, he just 
dropped them. 
</P>
<P>
 As his hands and the dumbbells fell together to the floor, the tip of his 
right middle finger was smashed between the falling dumbbell and one Weber 
didn't see already on the floor. 
</P>
<P>
 At first, he thought he was merely in excruciating pain. Then he looked at 
what he had done. 
</P>
<P>
 "I brought my finger up to eye level," Weber said, "and I could just see it 
was hanging by an artery." 
</P>
<P>
 He was rushed to the emergency room. But there was no rush once he got there. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just sat there for a couple hours looking at (my finger)," Weber said. 
"From the looks of it, I was pretty scared." 
</P>
<P>
 Doctors finally told him and his family he would need surgery, and there were 
no guarantees he would emerge from the operating room with his finger. 
</P>
<P>
 "The doctor would not give us any odds going in," Weber's father, Brian, said. 
"He said he'd do his best. He said even if they were successful reattaching the 
finger, he wasn't sure how it would heal." 
</P>
<P>
 Weber underwent four hours of reconstructive surgery, and the doctors declared 
the operation a success. There were a few days of uncertainty, though, because 
the color did not immediately return to his finger. 
</P>
<P>
 The finger was bandaged with a brace. About every two weeks, doctors 
re-wrapped the finger and removed dead skin. The stitches were removed twice. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first time they didn't get them all out," Weber said. "They couldn't find 
them all." 
</P>
<P>
 The only rehabilitation Weber underwent consisted of squeezing a ball, which 
is fitting for a guy who specializes in rebounding. He was cleared to play 
basketball Nov. 30, two days before the Golden Knights' opener. 
</P>
<P>
 Weber, a right-handed shooter, said the finger works normally now, although it 
is more sensitive. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always hit it wrong and it tingles for a little while," he said. "Also, the 
fingernail has not grown out completely." 
</P>
<P>
 His play seems to have been unaffected by the injury. 
</P>
<P>
 Weber was the most valuable player in the Chaminade tournament, which the 
Golden Knights won. He scored 24 of St. Francis' 59 points in the team's Jan. 3 
upset of St. John Bosco, now the 12th-ranked team in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 One of Weber's few on-court problems is he sometimes gets into foul trouble. 
He fouled out after playing 10 minutes Tuesday night against St. Anthony. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's just so big that the refs spot him early and often," Jordan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Weber, who has a 4.1 grade-point average, said the Air Force Academy, San 
Diego State and a handful of Division II and III colleges have shown interest 
in him. Jordan said Weber's strength makes him a prospect to play at the next 
level. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you just look at the kid physically, from a standpoint of strength, he 
could step in (and play college basketball) right now," Jordan said. "That's 
the problem with most freshmen -- strength." 
</P>
<P>
 Not a problem for Weber. He continues to lift weights and bulk up, just as he 
did before. With one exception. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm real careful when I'm lifting now," he said.

CRESCENTA VALLEY'S HAGMAN SETS 3-POINT MARK FOR SEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sarah Hagman of Crescenta Valley High scored 27 points and set a Southern 
Section one-season record for three-point baskets Wednesday, while leading the 
Falcons to a 50-38 victory over Pasadena in a Pacific League game. 
</P>
<P>
 Hagman, who made four three-point baskets against Pasadena, has made 115 this 
season, breaking a record set a season ago by Chino's Amee Pina, who finished 
with 112. 
</P>
<P>
 Crescenta Valley Coach Marc Ward stopped the game in the second quarter when 
Hagman scored her 113th and honored her achievement by handing her the game 
ball. Hagman, who owns the Southern Section mark for most three-pointers in a 
game with 13, scored 12 of her 27 points in the second quarter to fuel the 
Falcons' 28-20 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
 The Falcons (18-5, 8-1 in league play), who clinched a share of the league 
title, tied a section record for three-point baskets.  
</P>
<P>
 Crescenta Valley has made 151 three-pointers this season, equaling the number 
posted by Brea-Olinda in 1991-92. 
</P>
<P>
 Heather Green added 10 points for Crescenta Valley.

KEEPING TABS / DANA HADDAD: ACTION JACKSON AGAIN PONDERS BIG CHANGE 
</P>

 Darrin Jackson is no stranger to life-changing decisions. As a high school 
senior, he chose the service over a college basketball scholarship. Now that he 
has a scholarship and is averaging 10.9 points a game for New Mexico State, 
Jackson, 25, is considering a jump to professional basketball after this, his 
junior season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't say I will be here next year," said Jackson, a native of Dothan, 
Ala., who played at Antelope Valley College two years ago. "I've got to see how 
the end of this season goes, and then I'll look at my options." 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson, who prefers to be called D.J., is New Mexico State's second-leading 
scorer. The Aggies are 16-3, leading the Big West, and, unless they severely 
stub their toes, are headed for a berth in the NCAA tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 But team accomplishments aside, Jackson already is studying the NBA and other 
professional basketball leagues. Big decisions don't scare him much. Otherwise, 
he would not have joined the Navy out of high school. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was 6-4, kind of immature and I wanted to experience life," said Jackson, 
now 6-foot-8, 215 pounds. "I had scholarship offers, but they weren't big time. 
The biggest name was Kansas State." 
</P>
<P>
 In four years of Naval service as a medical assistant, he did not go overseas 
to "experience life," but he did play on the All-Armed Forces team, which 
prepared him for Antelope Valley. In 1991-92, he averaged 29.6 points and 13 
rebounds, and led the state in scoring. He broke J.R. Rider's school record for 
most points in a season (919) and then decided to move on. 
</P>
<P>
 "I picked New Mexico State because they had (former Moorpark College player) 
Sam Crawford at the time," Jackson said. "I was a big-time name in scoring and 
he was leading the nation in assists. So I wanted to play with that guy." 
</P>
<P>
 He shunned offers from DePaul, Oklahoma, Kentucky and Arizona. But they did 
not roll out the red carpet for Ensign Jackson in Las Cruces. He started only 
11 games last season -- taking over after forward Cliff Reed suffered an ankle 
sprain -- and his 29.6 scoring average plummeted by 22 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson is hardly back to his old form this season, although he ranks second 
in scoring among Aggies players. His shooting percentages are not impressive: 
37.5% from the field, 34.6% from three-point range and 61.4% from the 
free-throw line. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps this was one D.J. decision gone awry. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought I was going to put up big numbers here," he said. "But I found out 
this was a defensive team. I came from a system where you went to the glass or 
posted up. You played. Here, I've never gone inside. I've been on the perimeter 
as a three man." 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson is New Mexico State's designated bomber, the three-point specialist in 
a three-guard lineup. But it's difficult to complain when the Aggies are on top 
in the Big West at 8-2 (and ranked 23rd last week before losing consecutive 
games). 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't have so many regrets because of our team accomplishments," Jackson 
said. "I played 25 minutes and scored 11 points (with three rebounds and four 
assists) against Nebraska in the NCAA tournament last year as a sophomore." 
</P>
<P>
 If jumping to the pros with modest collegiate numbers sounds like an absurd 
decision, Jackson offers the case of guard Reggie Jordan, recently signed by 
the Lakers out of the Continental Basketball Assn. Jordan led the Aggies in 
1990-91 with a scoring average of 14.6. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Jackson, who is two semesters short of graduating with a degree in social 
work, "(Jordan's) numbers were about the same as mine. In college, they isolate 
you to do one thing. In the pros, the pace and style is totally different. It's 
more my game." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Checking the fax: Pepperdine's Dana Jones (North Hollywood) scored a 
personal-best 31 points against Portland last week and moved to ninth on the 
team's all-time scoring list (1,503). He is also second in rebounding with 946. 
</P>
<P>
 Oklahoma's Calvin Curry (Ventura College), who ranks ninth in the Big Eight 
Conference in three-point shooting percentage (37.5%), made six three-point 
baskets and scored a personal-best 27 points in a recent game against Iowa 
State. . . . Nevada Las Vegas' Dedan Thomas (Taft) ranks second in the Big West 
Conference in assists (7.2 per game) and steals (two). 
</P>
<P>
 UC Santa Barbara sophomore Sasha Scardino (Thousand Oaks), a walk-on last 
season, has scored in double figures 10 times this season as a starting 
forward.

THIS ONE'S FOR YOU, KBIG; LAW: BARRY MANILOW'S BUSINESS PARTNERS FILE SUIT IN 
SANTA ANA AGAINST RADIO STATION FOR AIRING AD THAT ASKS LISTENERS TO TUNE IN 
BECAUSE IT DOESN'T PLAY SINGER-SONGWRITER'S MUSIC. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Barry Manilow may write the songs that make the young girls cry, but KBIG 
radio station wrote an ad that made the songwriter's business partners cry 
foul. 
</P>
<P>
 The ad, which began airing this month in Orange County and other radio 
markets, invites listeners to tune into KBIG 104.3 -- because it doesn't play 
Manilow music. 
</P>
<P>
 Hastings, Clayton & Tucker, an entertainment agency that has various 
contractual rights to Manilow's name, sued the radio station Tuesday in Orange 
County Superior Court. The suit seeks at least $5 million in damages from 
Utah-based Bonneville International Corp., the parent company of KBIG and the 
station's manager. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the suit, the KBIG ad is "falsely disparaging." Nor, the suit 
alleges, was the station authorized to commercially use the singer's name, 
which "has become, through widespread and favorable public acceptance, a 
distinctive designation . . . and is an asset of incalculable value."  
</P>
<P>
 Representatives from Bonneville International Corp. and KBIG could not be 
reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 C. Tucker Cheadle, who is representing Hastings, Clayton & Tucker, said the 
singer is not directly involved in the suit and may not even know about it. He 
said the issues in the case involve "very complicated merchandising rights." 
</P>
<P>
 Cheadle said KBIG is damaging his client's business interests with its 
unflattering ad. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Barry Manilow is a very significant name in the entertainment 
industry," he said.

CANDIDATES FILE FOR JUNE 7 PRIMARY; GOP INFIGHTING DEVELOPS; POLITICS: ANAHEIM 
COUNCILMAN IRV PICKLER FILES FOR ASSEMBLY RACE. A REPUBLICAN FEUD SIMMERS OVER 
A 70TH ASSEMBLY CANDIDATE WHO IS NOT BACKED BY LAME DUCK GIL FERGUSON. 
</P>

<P>
 The June 7 primary election battle began taking shape Wednesday as candidates 
in state and judicial races met their first deadline to file their declarations 
to run. 
</P>
<P>
 Three of Orange County's incumbent Republicans will escape challenge in the 
primary, but the Democrats promised to give them a fight in the general 
election come November. 
</P>
<P>
 The Republicans facing no primary opposition are: Assemblyman Curt Pringle of 
Garden Grove in the 68th District; Assemblyman Mickey Conroy of Santa Ana in 
the 71st District, and Assemblyman Ross Johnson of Placentia in the 72nd 
district. 
</P>
<P>
 State Sen. William Craven (R-Oceanside) and 73rd District Assemblyman Bill 
Morrow (R-Oceanside), whose districts represent portions of south Orange 
County, also have no primary opponents. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those candidates creating a flurry of talk Wednesday was Anaheim 
Councilman Irv Pickler, who paid a $525 filing fee to hold a spot in the June 7 
Democratic Primary for the 68th Assembly District seat. 
</P>
<P>
 The races likely to draw the most attention are in the 69th and 70th Assembly 
districts, where the incumbents -- Assemblymen Tom Umberg (D-Garden Grove) and 
Gil Ferguson (R-Newport Beach) respectively -- are not seeking reelection. The 
filing deadline for those seats is extended until Monday. That is also the 
first day of filing for congressional candidates and nonpartisan county 
offices, such as the County Board of Supervisors, district attorney and 
sheriff-coroner. 
</P>
<P>
 A feud has already developed among Republicans over who will succeed Ferguson 
in 70th District, which is considered the most Republican Assembly district in 
the state. 
</P>
<P>
 Ferguson, who is stepping down for a possible run at the state Senate, accused 
state Sen. John R. Lewis (R-Orange) and Rep. Ed Royce (R-Fullerton) of being 
"self-anointed kingmakers" and endorsing Republican Phillip B. Greer, an Irvine 
attorney and one of at least four candidates seeking the GOP nomination in that 
race. 
</P>
<P>
 Ferguson would not say who will would be his choice for a successor, but he 
noted that it would not be Greer, a former Democrat. 
</P>
<P>
 "I cannot let these outsiders come in and dictate what's going on in this 
district," Ferguson said. "They know how I feel. They are constantly fooling 
around on elections. They have been doing this since high school, as I 
understand." 
</P>
<P>
 In a statement issued later, Lewis responded: "Gil Ferguson is a hypocrite. In 
1984, when he ran for the Assembly as a virtual unknown, I and other 
conservative legislators from outside that district endorsed him and helped 
elect him to office. According to Gil in 1984, we were dedicated public 
servants. But now we are outside meddlers." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the rivalry, Orange County Republican Chairman Thomas A. Fuentes said 
the squabbling would not diminish the party's chances of winning the seat. 
</P>
<P>
 "None of that amounts to anything, because whoever the Republican nominee is, 
he is going to win the election," Fuentes predicted. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though Democrats are fielding candidates in the major Assembly and state 
Senate races, Fuentes said their efforts would be futile. 
</P>
<P>
 As of the end of January, Republicans made up 52.3% of the registered voters 
in Orange County, compared to 34.4% for Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Democratic Party is essentially impotent in Orange County," Fuentes said. 
He noted that the Democrats' internal battle in the 69th Assembly District, 
which Umberg is leaving to run for state attorney general, could cause them to 
lose the only Orange County legislative seat they now hold. 
</P>
<P>
 But Orange County Democratic Chairwoman Dorianne Garcia predicted that her 
party will do better than expected because, unlike previous years, candidates 
were not recruited this year simply to put "warm bodies" on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we have great opportunities to get Democrats elected into Orange 
County elective offices this year," she said. "Democrats have been given a bum 
rap." 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia said the party is going to focus on the central Orange County districts 
where Democratic voter registration is highest. 
</P>
<P>
 The targeted districts include the 46th Congressional District now held by 
Rep. Robert K. Dornan (R-Garden Grove), the 68th and 69th Assembly districts, 
and the 34th state Senate District, which is being sought by Sen. Rob Hurtt of 
Garden Grove. Hurtt is currently listed as the senator for the 32nd District, 
which was redrawn and ended up in Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia said that money initially raised to defeat Dornan will be spread among 
those four targeted races. As of the end of the year, the "Beat Bob" 
fund-raising totaled $40,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The Democratic chairwoman noted that in the 1992 contest in the 68th Assembly 
District, Democrat Linda Kay Rigney received 44% of the vote against Pringle. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Pickler declared his intention to challenge Pringle in the 68th 
Assembly District, he said he is not sure he will stay in the race and will 
decide before the March 11 deadline to file final nomination papers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was looking at supervisor, I was looking at mayor, and at the Assembly 
district," Pickler said at the county registrar of voters office. 
</P>
<P>
 But, said Pickler, with his "good friend" Tom Daly now in the Anaheim mayor's 
seat, he is "leaning" toward the Assembly race. 
</P>
<P>
 Pringle said he would take a challenge from Pickler or any other Democrat 
"very seriously." But he remained confident he would prevail in November, 
suggesting that the race would come down to "a very clear-cut distinction 
between ideals" on issues such as taxes and big government. 
</P>
<P>
 Firing his first salvo of the campaign, Pringle noted that Pickler supported 
utility tax increases in Anaheim. "I oppose tax increases and have consistently 
done so in Sacramento," he said. "Irv Pickler has supported taxes." 
</P>
<P>
 Times staff writers Eric Lichtblau and Eric Bailey contributed to this report.

FRIENDSHIP DOWN DRAIN; NEIGHBORS' PLUNGE IN COMMODE-ITIES MARKET ENDS IN COURT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By E.J. GONG JR., TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For years, neighbors in the quiet, gated Newport Trails community shared a 
homely device made of garden hose, plastic piping and cork. They used it to 
unclog their sinks and toilets. 
</P>
<P>
 All was flowing smoothly until one of the neighbors had the brainstorm of 
marketing the gizmo. One man called it the "Hydro-Plunger." A woman called it 
the "Turbo-Plunger." 
</P>
<P>
 Their joint effort led to bickering, then ugly allegations of deception and 
greed and finally, this week, one neighbor filed a lawsuit against another, 
alleging the theft of "trade secrets."  
</P>
<P>
 The once-peaceful neighborhood, where families held regular barbecues and 
weekly happy hours, is divided over who owns legal rights to the "communal" 
plunger. 
</P>
<P>
 "The feeling of community has been lost," said Larry Gaugenmaier, an 
unemployed RV accessory supplier who is the defendant in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, Gaugenmaier stood in his garage where collages of past 
neighborhood parties cover the walls. He pointed to a picture of neighbor Lisa 
Leighton sitting in front of his house. "We used to be close friends," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Leighton filed a civil lawsuit against Gaugenmaier earlier this week, accusing 
him of unfair business practices, breach of contract and stealing trade 
secrets. 
</P>
<P>
 At the heart of the issue is a T-shaped, homemade plunger that neighbors said 
was used in the community for years. 
</P>
<P>
 Many Newport Trails residents preferred the plunger, which uses water pressure 
to clear clogged pipes, to standard plungers sold in hardware stores. The 
device rotated from house to house, depending on who had a problem. 
</P>
<P>
 In June, 1992, Leighton and Gaugenmaier were chatting at a barbecue when 
Gaugenmaier suggested that the neighborhood plunger might be a bigger seller. 
They decided to work together to manufacture and sell an improved version for a 
profit. 
</P>
<P>
 In her lawsuit, Leighton said she hired an engineer who modified the plunger's 
design so it worked more efficiently. Leighton, who has since moved to Laguna 
Beach, hired a patent attorney and paid various start-up and legal costs, while 
Gaugenmaier worked on design and distribution plans, according to the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 The two flew to a national hardware show in Chicago in August to look for 
suppliers and to test the market. Gaugenmaier said that representatives from 
stores such as Walmart and Home Depot expressed interest. 
</P>
<P>
 But then the deal backed up. 
</P>
<P>
 Gaugenmaier said he decided to develop and sell a simpler version of the 
plunger, which he said he designed on his own before teaming up with Leighton. 
He dubbed it the Hydro-Plunger. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he grew tired of waiting for Leighton, who in his opinion was moving 
too slowly in getting the product on the market. "It had been 18 months since 
we first started talking, and we hadn't produced one plunger yet," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gaugenmaier said Leighton was interested in making a more complex plunger with 
a special push button that would take more time to manufacture. She called her 
version the Turbo-Plunger. 
</P>
<P>
 Leighton declined to comment Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Her attorney, Dirk O. Julander, said Gaugenmaier "is engaged in unfair 
competition and is using the design of the plunger without the burden of paying 
for it." 
</P>
<P>
 The attorney said Leighton and her company, Klamath Corp., have invested 
thousands of dollars to improve the plunger's design, test the potential market 
and cover other start-up costs. He estimated that by the time the plunger hits 
the market Leighton will have spent $120,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Gaugenmaier said he has spent nearly $60,000 of his savings in making his 
Hydro-Plunger, which he wants to sell to mom-and-pop hardware stores for 
$24.95.  
</P>
<P>
 He said he did nothing wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was my idea from the start," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 On Gaugenmaier's dining room table sits a stack of letters from lawyers and a 
copy of his neighbor's lawsuit. "This thing has gotten blown out of 
proportion," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Several neighbors in the terra-cotta-roofed housing development declined to 
talk about the dispute. But Victor Armand, 57, who lives across the street from 
Gaugenmaier, said he believed the plunger was overrated.  
</P>
<P>
 "I used it for my second-floor bathroom," Armand said. "It didn't work as well 
as I thought it would."

GATES WILL INSTEAD RUN FOR REELECTION TO COUNTY JOB. HE CITES PERSONAL AND 
PROFESSIONAL REASONS FOR HIS CHOICE.

 Orange County Sheriff Brad Gates, mentioned repeatedly in recent weeks as a 
possible candidate for lieutenant governor, announced Wednesday that he has 
decided not to seek that post because of personal and professional concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Gates said in an interview, he will seek reelection as 
sheriff-coroner, a post he has held for two decades. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm really a cop before I'm a politician," said Gates, 54, a onetime guard in 
the County Jail who rose through the ranks and was first elected in 1974 with 
the backing of outgoing Sheriff James A. Musick. 
</P>
<P>
 Gates said he was "pleased and flattered" that unnamed leaders in the Orange 
County political community had encouraged him to seek the Republican nomination 
for lieutenant governor. 
</P>
<P>
 The timing appeared to favor a possible run by Gates in the wake of the 
statewide role he played in helping secure passage last November of a half-cent 
sales tax extension measure for law enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
 He would have been able to run as a tough law-and-order candidate at a time 
when crime has gained critical importance among voters. Several early polls 
showed that he could have fared well against other potential Republican and 
Democratic challengers. 
</P>
<P>
 But after several weeks of talks with political leaders around the state and 
with his family, Gates said he was concerned that a term as the state's 
second-highest-ranking elected official could prove difficult on his wife of 33 
years and his two children. The job would probably have forced him to live 
apart from his wife because of her business, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Gates said, the lieutenant governor's job appeared to offer him 
only a "limited" role to carry out his chief interest -- law enforcement -- and 
that the sheriff's job held more influence in helping ease growing public fears 
over crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Particularly disturbing, Gates said, have been recent high-profile criminal 
trials in which juries have either deadlocked or convicted defendants -- who 
claimed that they were justified in committing acts of violence -- of lesser 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Specifically, the sheriff referred to the Los Angeles murder trials of Lyle 
and Eric Menendez, who blamed past acts of molestation for driving them to 
murder their parents. The juries could not reach verdicts after weeks of 
deliberation. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've all had tough backgrounds," Gates said. "But when you start to use them 
as justification for committing a violent act, that's scary." 
</P>
<P>
 One deciding factor in Gates' announcement Wednesday, several political 
figures said, may have been the enormous campaign war chest that Gates would 
have had to amass in order to mount a successful campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "The word on the streets has been that the price tag was too high," said one 
prominent political consultant who spoke on condition of anonymity. "It was 
going to be $3 million just to win the (Republican) primary, if not more." 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Republican Party Chairman Tom Fuentes said he was one of 
"dozens" of people Gates sought out for advice before announcing his decision. 
</P>
<P>
 Fuentes said he warned the sheriff that as an Orange County-based candidate he 
would have difficulty getting his campaign message to a statewide audience 
because of the "parochial nature" of the local media. 
</P>
<P>
 "Orange County candidates live in a media ghetto," Fuentes said. "There is no 
dominant television or radio and Orange County news doesn't always run in the 
full circulation of the Los Angeles Times. Orange County candidates are not 
known beyond the borders of Orange County." 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Marshal Michael S. Carona, who had indicated his intention to 
run for sheriff if Gates sought higher office, said Wednesday that his 
candidacy remained "a possibility." Carona oversees security in the county's 
court operations. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will be important for me to sit down with people who offered some very 
important encouragement and discuss this development," Carona said. "Frankly, 
I'm surprised that Brad is not running for lieutenant governor. He spent his 
time in the county, but he's got to make the decision on his own. I'm sure it 
was a painful personal decision for him to make." 
</P>
<P>
 Carona said he has already raised about $10,000 toward a possible run for 
sheriff. 
</P>
<P>
 Gates said Carona had assured him last month that he would not run for sheriff 
if Gates decided to seek reelection. Gates said he knew of no real opposition 
in his reelection bid and felt confident running on his record. 
</P>
<P>
 But the past year has not been an easy one for Gates and his department. He 
sustained run-ins with the Board of Supervisors over his accessibility and 
attentiveness; a national tabloid television show aired an embarrassing 
videotape of a strip dancer at the Orange County Sheriff's Academy; and on Dec. 
25 a deputy was shot to death by a fellow training officer in an incident now 
under investigation by prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the lack of any declared opposition may not be enough to guarantee Gates 
a smooth road to reelection. Four years ago, Fullerton City Councilman Don 
Bankhead -- running a relatively low-profile campaign that relied on a fraction 
of what Gates had raised for the race -- managed to garner 44.5% of the vote.

COUNTY'S AIDS DEATH RATE EXCEEDS THAT OF U.S.; MORTALITY: FOR THE FIRST TIME, 
THE DISEASE CLAIMED MORE LIVES THAN BREAST CANCER IN 1992, ACCORDING TO AN 
ANNUAL COUNTY REPORT. HEART DISEASE, CANCER AND STROKES REMAIN THE OVERALL 
LEADING CAUSES OF DEATH. 
</P>

<P>
 The AIDS death rate in Orange County is exceeding the national mortality rate 
and the disease continues to be the leading cause of death for males between 25 
and 45, county officials said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 It was also the fourth leading cause of death among females in the 25 to 45 
age group and, for the first time, deaths from AIDS outnumbered deaths from 
breast cancer in 1992. The number of women killed by breast cancer dropped from 
348 in 1991 to 297 in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Heart disease, cancer and strokes remain the overall leading causes of death 
in Orange County, according to the annual report, which analyzed 1992 mortality 
rates. It was released Wednesday by the Orange County Health Care Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Another significant trend is the increase in homicides, especially among 
Latino youths, said Dr. Rick Greenwood, the county's deputy director of public 
health. Homicide was the 22nd leading cause of death among Orange County's 
Anglos in 1992 but the second leading cause of death among Latinos, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Hugh F. Stallworth, county health officer, said: "Trends here are apparent 
and alarming. Deaths from heart diseases and cancer still head the list for all 
ages and sexes. However, the number and rate of AIDS and intentional injury 
deaths continue to climb." 
</P>
<P>
 The report showed that 310 people died from AIDS in the county, up from 267 
the previous year. As in 1991, AIDS ranked seventh among killers.  
</P>
<P>
 Greenwood noted that the death rate from AIDS in the county was 12.25 per 
100,000 in 1992, up from 10.8 per 100,000 the previous year. In 1991 the 
national death rate from AIDS was 11.7 per 100,000. 
</P>
<P>
 On a more positive side, Greenwood said he believes that the reduction in 
breast cancer fatalities "probably shows the effects of screening and early 
intervention and treatment." 
</P>
<P>
 Homicide continued to be the leading cause of death in 15- to 24-year-old 
males. By contrast, he said, in 1988, motor vehicle accidents were the leading 
cause of death in that group. 
</P>
<P>
 Suicide also climbed in the ranking from 10th in 1991 with 238 cases to eighth 
in 1992 with 273 cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, however, Orange County continues to have a lower death rate than the 
nation or the state. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, 14,557 people died in the county in 1992, the report said, for a death 
rate of 575.1 per 100,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our death rate overall is very good," Greenwood said. "We have a fairly young 
population and a relatively fit population in comparison with the eastern part 
of the United States."

COUNTYWIDE: OCTA SURVEY SIGNALS WORST TRAFFIC SPOTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY A. PERLMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Among the county's streets with the worst traffic flow, according to a survey 
by the Orange County Transportation Authority, are Culver Drive and Jamboree 
Road in Irvine, El Toro Road in Mission Viejo, Coast Highway in Laguna Beach 
and Valley View Boulevard in Garden Grove. 
</P>
<P>
 A list of more than 400 drivers' complaints collected since Nov. 24 were given 
to officials from several Orange County cities during a committee meeting 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The survey sought the public's help in identifying thoroughfares and 
intersections where there's an apparent lack of signal synchronization, a high 
priority among drivers, according to previous public opinion polls. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem intersections, receiving five complaints or more: 
</P>
<P>
 * Bake Parkway at the Foothill tollway near Lake Forest. 
</P>
<P>
 * Bristol Street at Warner Avenue in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 * Newland Street at Adams Street in Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 * Bolsa Chica Road at the San Diego Freeway in Westminster. 
</P>
<P>
 * MacArthur Boulevard at University Avenue in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 During Wednesday's session, officials from several cities told OCTA public 
board member Sarah L. Catz, who initiated the survey, that she should have 
consulted them first. 
</P>
<P>
 "The public has unrealistic expectations," Arya Rohani, Irvine's manager of 
transportation services, said after the meeting. "We did not have input. . . . 
There's a need for an education process." 
</P>
<P>
 Rohani and others said there are many reasons why some intersections or street 
segments lack good signal coordination, including equipment failure, the 
inability of some equipment to perform the tasks needed, new construction, and 
unequal distance between traffic lights, especially in South County. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, "if traffic volume exceeds the capacity of the street or intersection 
to handle it, signal coordination isn't going to solve the problem," Rohani 
added. 
</P>
<P>
 Catz said later that "a wide gap exists between the public perception and the 
perceptions of the professionals, and we need to work to reduce that gap 
substantially." 
</P>
<P>
 "The technology is available to do something about this, so I think we should 
do it," Catz added. "As a public board member, I have an obligation to listen 
to the public." 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said they will work to establish a quick-response program to 
handle the motorists' complaints. JEFFREY A. PERLMAN

SAW CITY GROW

<P>
 Richard Worcester was selected as the Irvine Police Department's Officer of 
the Year this week -- 18 years after he became one of the city's first cops. 
</P>
<P>
 During his years on the force, Worcester has watched the community transform 
itself from a patchwork of housing tracts separated by wide swaths of farmland 
to a thriving city of sleek office towers and meticulously planned residential 
"villages." 
</P>
<P>
 He has also seen the nature of policing in the city change. When he was hired 
as one of Irvine's first officers, police were often called on to coax 
livestock off roads. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the department is dealing with a myriad of contemporary law enforcement 
problems, from gang activity to high-tech, white-collar crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Worcester, 40, has changed with the times. He has worked more than half a 
dozen jobs during his years on the force. 
</P>
<P>
 Worcester currently is a senior motorcycle officer in the traffic bureau and 
is a longtime member of the Special Operations Unit. He has previously served 
as a detective, traffic investigator and juvenile crimes investigator. 
</P>
<P>
 Dealing with youths has been a special interest. He is the adviser for the 
Irvine Police Explorers program and frequently speaks to classes about traffic 
and driver safety. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's very professional and very enthusiastic about his job," said Lt. Sam 
Allevato, who has worked with Worcester for nearly 18 years. "He is very caring 
toward others and is especially good at giving instruction to children and 
young adults." 
</P>
<P>
 Worcester came to the department at age 22, just after graduating from Cal 
State Long Beach. His first assignment was to control traffic during the 
opening of Woodbridge village. The task included dealing with the dozens of 
people who camped out next to the development in hope of buying Woodbridge 
homes. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the early days, there was just one restaurant in the whole city that was 
open 24 hours a day," Worcester remembered. "When we worked the night shift, 
we'd eat our dinners and breakfasts there." 
</P>
<P>
 After several years in the patrol bureau, Worcester eventually moved to the 
traffic division, where he said he takes his greatest pleasure in teaching 
students about safety. 
</P>
<P>
 "I enjoy that assignment very much. It's really constructive and positive," he 
said. "A lot of people who get into police work can't wait to get the bad guy. 
After you've done that for a while, you look for new activities and challenges. 
I've always had an interest in education." 
</P>
<P>
 Worcester lives in Irvine with his wife and two sons, ages 12 and 9. Now at 
the "midpoint" in his career, he predicts that law enforcement agencies will 
come under increasing scrutiny in the years to come. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that in the second half of my career, we'll see the police being 
constantly evaluated by the public, much more than in the first half of my 
career," he said. "The challenge is to exist under that kind of a watchful 
eye." SHELBY GRAD

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS / SADDLEBACK / SOUTH BEACH: DANA POINT; CITY OKS LANDSLIDE 
CLEANUP PACKAGE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Nearly a year after a massive landslide, the City Council this week voted to 
endorse a federally funded $3.1-million repair package that will not only clear 
Coast Highway but also restore seven privately owned bluff-top lots. 
</P>
<P>
 The council voted 4-0 Tuesday to approve the plan to rebuild the 75-foot 
bluffs along La Ventana in San Clemente and open the roadway, which has been 
closed since the cliff collapsed in February, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 The project includes a network of cable anchors designed to not only stabilize 
the bluffs but restore the homeowners' properties. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman William L. Ossenmacher was absent. 
</P>
<P>
 Last December, the council approved a less-intense project that would have 
cleared the highway and built a retaining wall only. But several months of 
negotiations with the homeowners and the city of San Clemente ultimately led to 
an agreement that shares the added costs of the repairs among all the parties, 
said Councilman Mike Eggers. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement stipulates that the homeowners pay $200,000 for the extra repair 
work through a loan guaranteed by the city of San Clemente. It also stipulates 
that the two cities share all costs not covered by federal grants, an amount 
estimated to be $150,000, Eggers said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Finally, it's all done," said Eggers, adding that he and the other council 
members were frustrated by the many delays. "But I'm not cracking any Champagne 
corks over this." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the work will start in the coming months, the highway is not expected 
to be open until June, 1995. LEN HALL

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS / COSTA MESA / NEWPORT / IRVINE: IRVINE; MEETINGS TO FOCUS 
ON AMUSEMENT PARK 
</P>

<P>
 The developers seeking to build an amusement park at the corner of Harvard 
Avenue and ichelson Drive will meet with residents over the next few weeks in 
an effort to work out differences over the controversial development. 
</P>
<P>
 The meetings are designed to focus on crime, parking and other issues raised 
by opponents of the Palace Park development. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council on Tuesday approved a resolution encouraging the dialogue and 
asking that city officials report back on the progress of the meetings within 
45 days. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members said the discussions will give residents a chance to express 
their concerns directly to the developers, who have indicated a willingness to 
modify parts of their proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the proposed site is zoned for commercial recreational use, the park 
is considered a "permitted use" that can be built without Planning Commission 
and City Council hearings as long as general city guidelines are followed. 
</P>
<P>
 The council on Tuesday unanimously rejected a call from opponents that the 
Planning Commission and City Council conduct a review of the project anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 City Atty. Joel D. Kuperberg said requiring a more intense review process for 
Palace Park after the developers had begun pulling permits represented "a 
classic situation for litigation." Such a move might "expose (the city) to 
liability," Kuperberg added. 
</P>
<P>
 Several council members also said changing the planning process because of 
community opposition would be unfair to the developers and not a good business 
practice. 
</P>
<P>
 The council's decision was a disappointment to the 20 or so residents who on 
Tuesday requested the project review. The residents -- most of whom live in the 
nearby University Park and Westpark villages -- fear the park's miniature golf 
course, bumper boat rides and arcade will attract gang members to the area and 
increase crime, traffic and noise. 
</P>
<P>
 The residents argued that a full review of the project is in the best 
interests of the city and noted that the Planning Commission last week agreed 
that such developments should be the subject of public hearings and commission 
approval. 
</P>
<P>
 Gerry Johnson, a partner in the Camelot Park development group, reiterated his 
promise Tuesday to operate a safe park and work out a security plan with the 
Irvine Police Department. SHELBY GRAD

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS / COSTA MESA / NEWPORT / IRVINE: COSTA MESA; CITY TO SEEK 
BETTER GRANT DISTRIBUTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The City Council voted unanimously this week to try to improve the way it 
distributes federal money to community service groups. The council gave more 
than $160,000 in community development grants to 33 nonprofit organizations in 
fiscal year 1993-94. 
</P>
<P>
 The council agreed Monday to try to reduce the total number of grants because 
the city uses an average of $388 of the federal money for administration of 
each grant, according to Muriel Berman, redevelopment and housing manager. 
</P>
<P>
 Berman suggested that nonprofit groups working to help the same kinds of 
people join together to apply for one large grant. 
</P>
<P>
 Council member Mary Hornbuckle said the city would rather send money to the 
nonprofit groups than use it on administrative costs. "I'm just concerned that 
we get all the money downstream," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Costa Mesa's average grant last year was less than $5,000, while other cities 
granted an average of $10,000 to $30,000 per applicant, according to Berman. 
Share Our Selves of Costa Mesa received the most last year -- $15,000 for its 
emergency services and $9,000 for its medical clinic. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange Coast Interfaith Shelter received $8,000 last year, according to 
city housing and community development worker Paula Schaefer. FISH-Harbor Area 
Inc., which provides hotel vouchers, food, clothing and other emergency help, 
received $15,000, she said. And the Feedback Foundation, which provides in-home 
meals for seniors and people who can't leave their homes, got $12,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Debby O'Connor, director of FISH, said she plans a joint grant application 
this year with other groups that help the homeless, but said there will not be 
a lead agency. "No one has the funds to take on that one lead role," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The money is distributed by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban 
Development, and is to be used to help poor people and improve social services. 
</P>
<P>
 Groups can apply for the 1994-95 fiscal year through mid-March. Extra points 
will be awarded in the review process for applications from nonprofit groups 
who propose to work together. WILLSON CUMMER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS / COUNTYWIDE: RIGHTS PANEL TO HOLD DISCUSSION SESSIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Orange County Human Relations Commission, hoping that diverse ethnic 
communities can move closer by exploring common ground and appreciating their 
differences, is inviting people to share their family background in a series of 
countywide discussion groups. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission is organizing Living Room Dialogues, encounter sessions where 
people discuss their heritage and the nuances of their family background -- 
from religious practices to recipes. 
</P>
<P>
 The goal, organizers say, is to bridge the gulfs that separate ethnic groups 
in an informal, enjoyable ice-breaker, said Rusty Kennedy, the commission's 
executive director. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of all, this is time spent together, a structured way to build 
friendships between people that otherwise might not meet," Kennedy said. "The 
family is the fundamental unit of all societies, so it's a natural starting 
point to explore." 
</P>
<P>
 The dialogues, which will begin in mid-March, will be in homes, community 
centers, schools, senior centers and other meeting places. Discussion groups 
will range from five to 20 members. There will be a facilitator to lead 
discussions.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS / NORTHWEST: HUNTINGTON BEACH; ROHRABACHER STAND ON QUAKE 
AID IS HIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 More than a dozen Latino activists demonstrated outside Rep. Dana 
Rohrabacher's office Wednesday, blasting him and several other elected 
officials for supporting federal legislation that would deny long-term aid to 
illegal immigrants who suffered losses in the Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the Chicano Unidos Coalition labeled Rohrabacher (R-Huntington 
Beach) and Rep. Ron Packard (R-Oceanside) "Mexican bashers," for their lead 
roles in working to deny illegal immigrants long-term earthquake relief. 
</P>
<P>
 Both men waged a successful campaign in the House of Representatives to amend 
California's $8.6-billion earthquake relief bill to deny aid to illegal 
immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill was delayed in the Senate on Wednesday but still appeared headed for 
passage by the end of the week. A hurdle to the bill's passage was removed when 
the Senate adopted a compromise that would require federal agencies to take 
reasonable steps to determine whether any applicant for assistance of 90 days 
or longer is in the country legally. 
</P>
<P>
 It would be up to the federal agencies "determine what they consider 
reasonable steps." 
</P>
<P>
 The coalition -- composed of representatives from a number of Latino groups -- 
pledged to work against the reelection of Rohrabacher, Packard and other 
California officials who back the legislation, including Sen. Dianne Feinstein, 
(D-Calif.) 
</P>
<P>
 Arturo Montes of the League of United Latin American Citizens of Santa Ana 
accused Rohrabacher and others of "race baiting" and jumping on the 
"anti-immigrant bandwagon" in order to win votes this November. 
</P>
<P>
 "We may have only 15% or 20% of the vote but (Rohrabacher) needs that to get 
into office," Montes said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Rohrabacher said Wednesday's protest was only an attempt to cover up 
important issues. 
</P>
<P>
 "With limited tax dollars, how are we going to be able to provide the same 
benefit package to illegal aliens as our own citizens and legal residents?" he 
asked.BRIAN RAY BALLOU

 News that the Southwest Museum -- which had considered leaving Los Angeles for 
larger quarters -- will stay in its current home came as a "big disappointment" 
to officials here, who had hoped the city would inherit the museum's venerable 
repository of Native American artifacts. 
</P>
<P>
 "We thought that their operation would be an attraction with the ability to 
draw tourists," Matthew Fertal, Garden Grove's community development director, 
said Wednesday."We thought we had offered a very attractive proposal." 
</P>
<P>
 In choosing Los Angeles, the Southwest Museum board rejected about 80 offers 
from throughout Southern California. But only Ventura County and Thousand Oaks 
remained contenders for the museum after it announced it would need $35 million 
to construct a new building. 
</P>
<P>
 The city of Los Angeles has promised to establish a committee to help the 
79-year-old museum expand its current location.ZAN DUBIN

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS / CENTRAL: TUSTIN; ANTI-SMOKING EFFORT TARGETS 4TH-GRADERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BERT ELJERA

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 His grandmother smokes; so does his mother. And when he was 9 years old, on a 
friend's dare, Sunny Flud said he tried taking a few puffs himself. 
</P>
<P>
 "I gagged and coughed, like my throat burned," said Sunny, now 10, a 
fourth-grader at Marjorie Veeh Elementary School in Tustin. "I immediately gave 
the cigarette back." 
</P>
<P>
 But experiments like Sunny's often lead to smoking among adolescents, 
according to Linda Smith, coordinator of drug, alcohol and tobacco education 
programs at Tustin Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
 Statistics are not readily available about smoking among children, but Smith 
said that a recent study at UC Irvine indicated that 10th-graders who are heavy 
smokers began experimenting with tobacco in the fourth grade. 
</P>
<P>
 So for a program to be effective in preventing teen-agers from smoking, it 
must begin among 9- and 10-year-olds, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 That's the idea behind Pals for Help, which the school district started this 
year with money from a state grant, Smith said. Under the program, volunteer 
students from Tustin and Foothill high schools go to fourth-grade classrooms to 
discuss the harmful effects of tobacco. 
</P>
<P>
 The group of eight volunteers have so far reached 400 fourth-graders in four 
elementary schools, Smith said. About 600 more students in six other schools 
are expected to attend the discussions in the next few months, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday, Smith and two teen-age student volunteers were at Veeh Elementary 
School, hopping from one class to another making presentations. 
</P>
<P>
 But instead of lectures, the team put the students in groups and asked each to 
draw a life-size picture of a smoker, indicating the parts of the body that are 
affected by tobacco. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the most effective way to get the students involved," Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunny giggled Tuesday as his group of six students showed a drawing of Jason, 
a make-believe teen-ager who smokes. 
</P>
<P>
 Jason had bloodshot eyes, sooty brown teeth, and breath that could make a 
dragon sick, said Victoria Elerding, 10, who was in Sunny's group as she 
explained the drawing to the class. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bad things can really happen to you if you smoke," Victoria said. 
</P>
<P>
 Classmate Scott Adams, 10, said: "Every kid should see this. I hate smoking. 
No way will I ever try it." 
</P>
<P>
 Kenny Poole, 9, said he has friends who already are heavy smokers. 
</P>
<P>
 Dan Greenwood, 17, a student volunteer, said: "We tell them that a smoker is 
not necessarily a bad person. The smoker simply has a bad habit that must 
stop." 
</P>
<P>
 Volunteer Laurie Cast, 19, a Foothill High School senior, said that she thinks 
9- and 10-year-olds would rather listen to teen-agers than adults. 
</P>
<P>
 "To these kids, (being in) high school is big time, so what we say, I think, 
sticks in their minds," Cast said. "It makes me feel good. I feel like I'm 
making a difference." BERT ELJERA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS / NORTH: YORBA LINDA; SOME ARE UNHAPPY ABOUT NEW CENTER 
</P>

 The Yorba Linda Community Center officially opens Saturday, and not everyone 
in the neighborhood is pleased. 
</P>
<P>
 With its 317 parking spaces, the community center could be seen as bringing 
much-needed parking to the area. But some residents on the east side of Casa 
Loma Avenue and surrounding streets say that benefit will be offset by an 
increase in traffic and noise. 
</P>
<P>
 The 28,000-square-foot community center is the fifth public facility on the 
west side of Casa Loma between Yorba Linda Boulevard and Imperial Highway. The 
others are the Placentia-Yorba Linda Unified School District education center, 
City Hall, Yorba Linda Middle School and Hurless Barton Park. Valley View Sport 
Park, with several baseball and soccer fields, is immediately west of the 
school. 
</P>
<P>
 "Casa Loma can't handle any more traffic," said Kathy Corcoran, who lives on 
Ladera Circle, across Casa Loma from the community center. "Already we have to 
put up with the park and the school." 
</P>
<P>
 "The city puts on some great events here but it comes with a price that we 
have to pay," said Nola Piper. "I know we need these facilities but it doesn't 
seem right that we get dumped with so many of them." 
</P>
<P>
 Other residents like living near the concentration of public buildings and 
amenities. Kris Widdison of Meadowview Drive said his family enjoys the close 
proximity to city and school facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have five kids, so we derive a lot of benefit from being so close to 
everything," Widdison said.  
</P>
<P>
 Judy Hahn, who has lived in the city for more than 30 years, said the 
facilities are necessary to keep youths occupied and provide a place for 
community groups to gather. 
</P>
<P>
 "Where else should the city put the community center?" Hahn asked. "I would 
just as soon see the city the way it was when we first came, but since it's 
changed, you do have to have these facilities." 
</P>
<P>
 The grand opening ceremony will start at 10 a.m. Saturday. Refreshments will 
be served. 
</P>
<P>
 The $6-million community center will serve as a meeting place for senior 
citizens, the Yorba Linda Women's Club and youth and community groups. The city 
also plans to schedule a limited number of afternoon and evening recreation 
classes there and has already booked 30 wedding receptions for this 
year.DANIELLE A. FOUQUETTE

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS / CENTRAL: WESTMINSTER; FIRE OFFICIAL WILL APPEAL DISMISSAL 
</P>

 The lawyer of Paul Gilbrook, the embattled president of the firefighters 
union, said Wednesday he will appeal the firing of his client as the first step 
of a process that could eventually end up in court. 
</P>
<P>
 Alan C. Davis said city officials notified him by fax in his San Francisco 
office Tuesday that Gilbrook, a 13-year veteran of the Fire Department, had 
been terminated as of that day. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis said city officials have given Gilbrook five days to appeal, which 
Gilbrook plans to do. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will show that the city has failed to terminate him for cause," said 
Davis, who said that despite the appeals, he expects the case to reach the 
courts. 
</P>
<P>
 After conducting a hearing last week, Assistant City Manager Don Anderson made 
the decision to terminate Gilbrook, who allegedly drove a fire engine with a 
suspended driver's license last year and allegedly used sick leave improperly. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson declined to provide details of the case and referred inquiries to 
City Atty. Richard Jones. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones said a copy of Anderson's decision was faxed to Gilbrook's lawyer 
following fruitless efforts by city officials to contact Gilbrook on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones said that according to city policy, Gilbrook may appeal his termination 
to City Manager Jerry Kenny. If Kenny upholds the termination, Gilbrook can 
then take his case to the Merit Commission, a three-member citizens panel that 
can recommend to the City Council either to fire Gilbrook or give him back his 
job. 
</P>
<P>
 The council may uphold or reject the Merit Commission's recommendation, Jones 
said. After that, Gilbrook may go to court, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gilbrook, 37, has been suspended with pay since Dec. 28. On Jan. 26, Fire 
Chief John T. DeMonaco Jr. sent him a termination notice following a city 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Gilbrook has said that he has done nothing wrong and that the City Council is 
retaliating for his support of a recall drive against Mayor Charles V. Smith 
and council members Charmayne S. Bohman, Craig Schweisinger and Tony Lam.BERT

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS / NORTHWEST: BUENA PARK; ANTI-GRAFFITI LAW CALLED 
'INTRUSION' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBRA CANO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An ordinance that increases penalties for graffiti vandals who deface public 
and private property goes into effect in March. 
</P>
<P>
 The new anti-graffiti ordinance received final approval by the City Council 
Monday. The ordinance also requires parents whose children are caught 
vandalizing to bear the cost and allows the city to offer rewards for the 
apprehension and conviction of graffiti vandals. 
</P>
<P>
 The ordinance bans the sale to minors of spray paints, felt-tip markers and 
other implements typically used by graffiti vandals and also requires 
businesses to keep such devices out of the reach of juveniles. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at one local business, which sells such equipment, said the new 
requirements won't solve the problem and will create unnecessary expense for 
his company. 
</P>
<P>
 "We see it as an unnecessary intrusion into our workplace," said Bruce W. 
Whitaker, controller at Buena Park Lumber. 
</P>
<P>
 The ordinance requires businesses to keep graffiti implements in a locked 
cabinet or display case, or they may be stored behind a sales or service 
counter -- in an area where the public is not allowed. 
</P>
<P>
 Whitaker said the lumber company favors laws to reduce vandalism, rather than 
restrictions on businesses. Minors will find ways to get their hands on spray 
paints and other tools used in vandalism, he said.  
</P>
<P>
 "All they need is someone older who is willing to purchase them," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 But police said that many of the youths caught for graffiti vandalism steal 
their tools. 
</P>
<P>
 Whitaker estimated that it will cost the store between $2,000 and $3,000 to 
comply with the ordinance even though the store already has an anti-theft 
system that tags merchandise with an electronic sensor. The system costs about 
$30,000, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe that this (system) supersedes this type of ordinance."  
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Donald L. Bone believes the changes to the city's graffiti ordinance 
give the city another tool in fighting the war on graffiti. 
</P>
<P>
 The city spends about $82,000 a year on graffiti removal, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we have with graffiti is a breakdown of parents controlling their 
children," Bone said. "There is no doubt that the lack of parental control" has 
cost both business and government money.DEBRA CANO

PROTESTERS DEMAND FREEDOM FOR GANG-TRUCE ACTIVIST; COURTS: THEY SAY SEVERITY OF 
DRUG-RELATED CHARGES AGAINST ART L. ROMA STEMS FROM HIS LEADERSHIP ON STREETS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 About a dozen protesters marched outside the federal courthouse Wednesday 
demanding the freedom of former street gang leader Art L. Roma, who is on trial 
on narcotics and money laundering charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Roma, 31, is noted for his efforts to forge a truce among Orange County's 
gangs. He was arrested by federal drug agents in September, 1992, at the close 
of a major investigation of an international money laundering operation. 
</P>
<P>
 But the protesters who gathered in front of the U.S. District Court building 
Wednesday said Roma played a minor role in the sprawling case, acting only as a 
one-time courier delivering a package he did not know contained $60,000. 
</P>
<P>
 They waved placards reading "Free Art" and "Stop the Drive-bys." The 
demonstrators said they believe the severity of the charges against Roma stems 
from his activism on the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 "He knows he made a mistake and he's willing to pay for his crime, but these 
charges are ridiculous," said Leticia Rivera, Romo's companion. "It's 
political. They see him as a threat because of his influence." 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecutor, Thomas P. Sleisenger, declined to comment about the ongoing 
trial, which began Nov. 9 and may finish by the end of the month. 
</P>
<P>
 Romo is on trial with six other co-defendants. All were arrested during 
"Operation Green Ice," an undercover operation involving police in six 
countries. Rivera said attorneys have told her that Roma could face more than 
15 years in prison if he is convicted of the three felony charges he faces. 
</P>
<P>
 Roma was among five former gang leaders who founded the United Gangs Council 
in 1992 and authored a shaky, but often praised, peace treaty among the 
county's gangs. 
</P>
<P>
 "The shootings, the drive-bys, they decreased after the truce was forged," 
Mike Roma, the defendant's brother, said Wednesday. "No one can deny that. When 
that happened all the politicians wanted to know Art, but now they turn their 
back on him."

 The quarantined area for the Mediterranean fruit fly has been expanded to 
include another 300 square miles, about 100 of which are in mostly residential 
areas of Orange County, officials said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The new quarantine here primarily affects the Brea-Yorba Linda area and the 
Orange County-Long Beach border. The expanded area also includes parts of Los 
Angeles, Riverside and San Bernardino counties. 
</P>
<P>
 For Orange County, "a good portion of the area (newly quarantined) is 
residential, with some back-yard farmers, people who grow fruits and vegetables 
in their back yard and sell them to neighbors, farmers markets, those kind of 
things," said John Ellis, deputy agricultural commissioner of Orange County. 
"The new area is going to include a few more growers, but in many cases they 
will have some time to prepare for the new requirements, because their crops 
are not ripe yet."  
</P>
<P>
 But "they are going to have to regulate the products that they are growing if 
those crops are hosts to Medflies, or they may choose alternate crops that 
aren't hosts," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 In Orange County, where agriculture is a quarter-billion-dollar industry 
annually, Medflies have been detected in Westminster, Santa Ana, Anaheim, 
Orange and Yorba Linda, said Larry Hawkins, spokesman for the Cooperative 
Medfly Project, a joint county and state effort to eradicate Medflies. But that 
"does not mean that there are millions of (them) there," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 The expanded quarantine area, which went into effect Friday, now includes 
1,576 square miles in Southern California. A total of 307 are in Orange County, 
including Anaheim, Orange, Santa Ana, Westminster, Brea and Yorba Linda. 
</P>
<P>
 The quarantined area was established by the state Department of Food and 
Agriculture in July in an effort to stop the infestation of the pests that 
broke out in Granada Hills last year. Fruits grown in the quarantined area may 
not leave unless they are processed (cooked, canned or frozen, for example) or 
treated with appropriate pesticides. Growers must comply or face a fine, said 
Carl DeWing, a state agriculture spokesman.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Quarantined areas will also be inundated with more sterile flies starting 
March 1. This was also done last fall in Westminster and Santa Ana, and later 
in Yorba Linda, Orange and Anaheim. The strategy is that mating between the 
sterile fly and the Medfly will breed the Medfly out of existence. This will be 
done for the first time in Brea, because it lies between areas where Medflies 
have already been spotted, Hawkins said.  
</P>
<P>
 "We want to have a large, wide-scale program that ensures we will not have 
these isolated infestations popping up," Hawkins said, adding that the sterile 
fly infestation program will cost about $30 million in 1994.

SANTA ANA MAN SHOT AFTER TRAFFIC ACCIDENT DIES; POLICE SEEK SUSPECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A man shot Jan. 22 after a minor traffic accident in front of his house died 
Wednesday of his wounds, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jesus Isidoro, 41, died at Western Medical Center-Santa Ana as a result of 
bullet wounds to his shoulder and chest, according to Lt. Robert Helton. 
</P>
<P>
 Isidoro was a passenger in a car that collided with a parked vehicle in front 
of his house in the 2000 block of South Towner Street. The parked vehicle was 
owned by Juan Ruiz, 30, of Santa Ana. Ruiz told police he thought the car 
Isidoro was riding in was a hit-and-run, and he fired one round at the vehicle 
with a semiautomatic pistol. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruiz was arrested on suspicion of assault with a deadly weapon and released on 
bail, Helton said. Investigators are now looking for him for questioning, and 
the matter will be submitted to the Orange County district attorney's office.

YOUTH SHOT AT VIETNAMESE RESTAURANT; VIOLENCE: PATRONS ARE SHOWERED BY BROKEN 
WINDOW GLASS BUT NOT INJURED. ASSAILANTS ESCAPE IN CAR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gunfire shattered the calm outside a Vietnamese restaurant Wednesday 
afternoon, leaving one youth wounded in the foot and showering restaurant 
patrons with shattered window glass, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The shooting, which authorities said appeared to be gang-related, took place 
in the parking lot of a strip mall in the 14500 block of Brookhurst Street, on 
the border with Garden Grove. Four months ago, a similar incident took place 
about a 1 1/2 miles away in a parking lot outside a coffee shop. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses told police that Wednesday's incident began about 2:30 p.m. inside 
the Pho 86 restaurant, when two young males at a table were confronted by three 
other young males who walked into the restaurant. An argument ensued, and all 
five of those involved moved to the parking lot. Someone in the second group 
pulled a handgun and fired several times, police said, hitting one man in the 
lower leg and missing the other, who ducked behind a parked car. The three 
assailants, including a gunman wearing a dark jacket, fled in a mid-1980s 
Toyota Supra, according to Lt. Richard Main. 
</P>
<P>
 The wounded youth, whom police have not identified, was taken to UCI Medical 
Center in Orange for treatment. Several of the shots shattered windows of the 
restaurant, but no customers were injured. 
</P>
<P>
 In late October in Fountain Valley, three young men were shot -- one fatally 
-- while standing in front of the Cafe Gia Hoi. The restaurant, near Edinger 
Avenue and Magnolia Street, is across the street from Westminster. 
</P>
<P>
 The three men were shot from a car as they tried to escape on foot. Tu Anh 
Nguyen, 19, was shot in the head and later died. The other two victims, in 
their early 20s, were wounded in the foot and neck. 
</P>
<P>
 A 27-year-old Garden Grove man, Phuong Phuc Le, was arrested on suspicion of 
murder and attempted murder. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had a number of incidents right in that area," Main said.

AROUND THE VALLEY: THURSDAY SPECIAL; SHOULDERING HARD TIMES, AND JUST ABOUT 
EVERYTHING ELSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HENRY CHU, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Pity the poor man who has everything -- and can't sell it. 
</P>
<P>
 That's the dilemma nowadays for Joe Sawyers, founder, proprietor and brains 
behind Sawyers & Sawyers, a North Hollywood operation that's a pack rat's dream 
come true. 
</P>
<P>
 Need a VCR you can plug into your car's cigarette lighter? Joe's your man. How 
about a denim jacket decorated by cult leader Tony Alamo? Go see Joe. A stuffed 
Bengal tiger? Well . . . actually, there you'd be out of luck. Sawyers already 
sold it for $1,000 to a Minnesota dude rancher who stopped in his store briefly 
after winning a John Wayne look-alike contest. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, even such an eclectic hoard of merchandise couldn't help him 
through the recession. He's had to move from his once-sprawling showcase store 
to a cramped, unmarked former print shop, and lately it's been one bout of hard 
times and bad luck after another. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every day I live, it gets easier to die," he muses. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't always that way. 
</P>
<P>
 Back in the glory days, customers streamed into Sawyers' 2,500-square-foot 
store on Lankershim Boulevard, eager to troll for good deals at a rummage sale 
gone haywire. 
</P>
<P>
 There were cut-rate knife sets, 5-foot Chinese vases, dolls, stereo systems, 
hair curlers, lawn mowers, never-worn designer clothes from a bygone era 
(Jordache jeans, anyone?), ersatz religious relics, plastic replicas of cheese 
and sausage, tennis rackets, rings, even an enormous, hand-carved wooden Buddha 
(cash only please). New stuff would pour in that Sawyers bought for pennies on 
the dollar at auctions and liquidation or surplus sales. 
</P>
<P>
 Back then, Sawyers was also the mainstay of movie prop masters, many of whom 
he met during his previous 20-year career as a transportation coordinator for 
various studios. 
</P>
<P>
 "Universal was big numbers for me," Sawyers, now 60, says. "Universal would 
come down and buy enough stuff to show a swap meet in a movie. Then a car would 
come through (the set) and destroy all the stuff -- but the good thing is, I 
never had to take it back." 
</P>
<P>
 He left the world of show biz ("that phony environment") a decade ago to begin 
hawking his goods full time, expanding a business he had been operating out of 
the back of his station wagon. For the first five years, he had a space in the 
local Teamsters office before moving onto Lankershim at the end of the '80s. 
</P>
<P>
 Business was sufficiently brisk to inspire the double name, Sawyers & Sawyers, 
although there was still only one of him. "I figured I worked twice as hard. 
Plus, it was a catchy name," he explains. 
</P>
<P>
 He kept abreast of commercial trends, kept a sharp eye out for big sales and 
kept faith that there's a market for virtually anything, no matter how 
outlandish. And gleefully he undercut major retailers with a zest that sprang 
from his Sicilian roots. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was just something about beating the system," he says. "It was good to 
hear a guy who'd just come from Circuit City, 'They want 50 more dollars for 
that TV.' " 
</P>
<P>
 But soon the troubles began. 
</P>
<P>
 First, the Community Redevelopment Agency eliminated easy parking near his 
store. Authorities ticketed motorists who parked in adjacent alleys, including 
Sawyers himself. Then, just after he underwent bypass surgery, Sawyers was 
given notice to shape up the building for earthquakes or ship out. He left in 
mid-1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "They wanted me outta there," he growls, still bitter. "I was the only one 
that was making a living there." 
</P>
<P>
 It was no small task moving everything to a small building on nearby Cleon 
Avenue, tucked in a desolate industrial zone. But the merchandise went back out 
on display and up went a sign proclaiming: "Sawyers & Sawyers: Factory Fresh 
Fish" -- a red herring, of course, "so nobody would ever rob me. Who the hell's 
gonna rob you for fish?" 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, business went downstream; Sawyers admits now the location was a 
mistake. Which finally drove him, three months ago, to the tiny, low-slung 
quarters he inhabits on Cahuenga Boulevard just north of Burbank Boulevard, 
hard by massive electrical towers and beneath a billboard advertising salsa. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now I'm still not over the shock" of moving again, which was so 
demoralizing he renounced retail sales for the time being in favor of 
wholesale, Sawyers says. 
</P>
<P>
 The Christmas season, usually a boon, was a bust. Few people came, and now 
Sawyers, a short, stocky man with glasses and a grizzled beard, only has the 
energy to open his crowded shop for regulars and old chums. Items are piled 
high on shelves in no particular order. Boxes remain unopened. Aisles allow 
browsing only by skinny folk. 
</P>
<P>
 The place has the musty air of an unopened tomb. Like King Tut's resting 
place, there's a little antechamber littered with rubble (in this case, wicker 
baskets), and when you peer into the dimness beyond, you can discern wonderful 
things -- everywhere the glint of plastic. Like Tut's tomb, however, the 
inventory is a fraction of what once was, the rest plundered by looters or 
recession. 
</P>
<P>
 And Sawyers himself is more curator now than peddler. He's also dispirited. 
Even the discovery of a collection of expensive stuffed and mounted fish isn't 
enough to restore his old enthusiasm. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every day I live, it gets easier to die," he says again. 
</P>
<P>
 But he'll keep trying to sell his stuff until the curtain falls. That much he 
knows. After all, you can't take it with you, and Joe Sawyers certainly has a 
lot of it.

BREA-OLINDA SCHOOL BOARD GIVES OK TO NEW CODE OF ETHICS FOR TRUSTEES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIMI KO, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Brea-Olinda Unified School Board members this week gave preliminary approval 
for a code of ethics for school board trustees. 
</P>
<P>
 The code "doesn't have anything to do with the board not having any ethics," 
Supt.Edgar Z. Seal said. "It has to do with what we've been reading in the 
papers . . . about legislators throughout the county being removed from office 
or forced to resign for using their position for personal gain." 
</P>
<P>
 The code was drafted so that present and future board members could have 
something that tells them, "up front, that their job and responsibility is to 
focus on the total district and not to use their position for personal gain or, 
maybe, to help out a friend," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Each board member must take actions that should encourage employees to 
increase competence and professional growth, the code states. It further 
obliges trustees to make decisions with honest convictions, "unswayed by 
partisan bias of any kind" and to consider the position as a public trust not 
to be used for private advantage. 
</P>
<P>
 "If board members live by this code of ethics, they really don't need to worry 
about ever getting sued," Seal said. "And they'll be great board members."

CITY REZONES FAIRVIEW-MACARTHUR; AREA TO SPEED CENTER DEVELOPMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council has rezoned 19 acres at Fairview Street and MacArthur 
Boulevard, making the area easier to develop as a community shopping center. 
</P>
<P>
 At its regular meeting Monday, the council approved the plan to rezone the 
vacant land, which is owned by C.J. Segerstrom and Sons. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Daniel H. Young said the rezoning would provide an excellent opportunity 
for quick development. 
</P>
<P>
 A report to the council states that no specific development plan has been 
proposed for the site, located on the east side of Fairview between Alton 
Avenue and MacArthur Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 Kenneth Adams, city planning manager, said after the meeting that the prior 
zoning allowed the site to be developed in two parts, one business and one 
residential. A single large commercial development, however, would fare much 
better than a smaller one.

DARKNESS EDIBLE: THE SYRUPS OF WINTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVEN RAICHLEN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For much of the country, January is a time of cold, darkness and gloom. And 
few places are gloomier than the northern parts of New England. The sky is 
gray; the trees are bare; the snow is deep. Yet with this glum month comes the 
first harbinger of spring: the flowing sap of the sugar maple tree. And from 
this sap comes a delicacy unique to North America: maple syrup. 
</P>
<P>
 For centuries, the Cree, Algonquin and Ojibwa Indians enjoyed the sweet sap of 
the sugar maple. They would gash the trees with a hatchet, collect the sap in 
birch bark buckets and boil it in wooden troughs by adding red-hot stones from 
the fire. The Colonists brought new refinements to the sugaring process, such 
as metal spiles (taps) to draw the sap from the tree. (Hatchet slashing tended 
to kill the tree.) But most important was the introduction of iron and copper 
vessels for boiling the syrup. 
</P>
<P>
 When maple sap leaves the tree, it contains about 4% sugar. Boiling evaporates 
the water, concentrating the sap's sweetness. The traditional device for 
boiling syrup is in a long, flat steel evaporator pan partitioned into a series 
of chambers. This pan sits on an "arch" or "firebox," stoked by burning logs or 
fuel oil. As the syrup thickens, it moves through a series of flues from the 
back of the evaporator to the front. 
</P>
<P>
 It sounds complicated, and it is complicated -- not to mention messy, 
uncomfortable and time-consuming. The sap itself is highly perishable: Ideally, 
it will be boiled the day it's collected. A 24-hour delay can mean the 
difference between a higher grade and an inferior grade of syrup. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A typical sugar house has the heat and din of Dante's proverbial inferno. 
Eye-stinging smoke rises from the firebox; steam rises from the evaporator. In 
peak season, the work days last 12 to 14 hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Some statistics: It takes 40 years for a maple tree to reach a 10-inch 
diameter -- the size suitable for tapping. (The tree must be 20 inches in 
diameter to accommodate a second tap.) It takes four trees six weeks to produce 
enough sap to make a single gallon of maple syrup. Each gallon of syrup 
requires one (four-foot) log or three gallons of fuel oil to stoke the 
evaporator. Forty gallons of sap are required to make a single gallon of maple 
syrup. 
</P>
<P>
 The quality of maple syrup is as quirky as the weather. The same tree might 
produce "Vermont Fancy" one year and Grade B the next. The best syrup tends to 
be made at the beginning of the season, but climatic conditions, the age and 
site of the trees, and the sugar maker's dexterity all contribute to the final 
product. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are three countries that produce maple syrup: Canada, the United States 
and Vermont," quips one sugar maker I know. Actually, syrup is made in every 
state in New England, not to mention Ohio, Michigan, Maryland, Wisconsin, 
Pennsylvania and New York. But Vermont is the industry leader, both in terms of 
production and quality control. 
</P>
<P>
 As the syrup leaves the evaporator, it is graded by color and density, 
according to strict standards set by the state. The highest grade is "Vermont 
Fancy," a syrup remarkable for its light amber color and delicate flavor. 
"Grade A medium amber" is slightly darker, but still mild-tasting. "Grade A 
dark amber" has a slight caramel flavor. "Grade B" is very dark, with a 
pronounced caramel flavor. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Vermonters use the highest grade on pancakes and waffles, deeming Grade B fit 
only for cooking. But I prefer the robust caramel taste of grade A medium amber 
to the delicate flavor of Vermont Fancy. In recent years, the traditional 
square metal cans have given way to rust-resistant plastic jugs. 
</P>
<P>
 Maple syrup is delicious on all manner of breakfast fare, from French toast to 
oatmeal, not to mention pork, ham, and, yes, even ice cream. (I like to warm 
syrup destined for pancakes and waffles before serving. To prevent it from 
boiling over, add a tiny piece of butter.) Syrup is the key ingredient for at 
least two New England specialties: Indian pudding and baked beans. 
</P>
<P>
 Unopened, maple syrup will keep indefinitely; it should be refrigerated once 
the container is opened. (Many Vermonters store their prize syrups in the 
freezer.) If the syrup should crystallize, you can bring it back to liquid form 
by placing the can in a pan of simmering water. 
</P>
<P>
 So remember, no matter how bleak winter seems, spring is just around the 
corner. The following pie will bring you sweetness any time of the year. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 This dulcet dessert is a sort of Yankee pecan pie. The recipe comes from the 
Hermitage Inn in Wilmington, Vt., where it is prepared with homemade maple 
syrup.

</P>
<P>
 MAPLE-WALNUT PIE 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 cup brown sugar, packed 
</P>
<P>
 2 tablespoons flour 
</P>
<P>
 1 1/4 cups maple syrup 
</P>
<P>
 3 tablespoons butter, melted 
</P>
<P>
 3 eggs, beaten 
</P>
<P>
 1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla 
</P>
<P>
 1 (9-inch) pre-baked pie crust 
</P>
<P>
 1 cup coarsely chopped walnuts 
</P>
<P>
 Combine brown sugar, flour and maple syrup in bowl and whisk until smooth. 
Beat in melted butter, eggs and vanilla. Spoon filling into crust and sprinkle 
walnut pieces on top. (They will sink temporarily, but will rise to surface

</P>
<P>
 Bake pie at 350 degrees until filling is puffed and set, about 40 minutes.

CITY HALL JOURNAL: WHITTIER; CITY FUNDING REVIVES AFTER-SCHOOL PROGRAM

<TEXT>
<P>
 City leaders have revived a youth recreation program at a local elementary 
school, giving dozens of children activities to do after school. 
</P>
<P>
 The program, based at Evergreen Elementary School, offers children 7 to 14 
sports, storytelling, arts and crafts, field trips, and classes in photography, 
cooking and first aid.Participants also will be able to check out books from a 
mobile library provided by the city. There is a $10 enrollment fee. 
</P>
<P>
 The financially strapped Boys and Girls Club of Whittier had sponsored the 
program the last two years, but could not afford to resume it when schools 
opened in September, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 City council members last month voted to spend $8,000 to revive the Evergreen 
program for the remainder of the school year. The city sponsors after-school 
programs at six other schools and parks, at an annual cost of $20,000 per site. 
</P>
<P>
 The program, which is expected to serve about 100 students. The activities run 
weekdays from 2:30 to 5 p.m. PHILLIP GARCIA

CITY HALL JOURNAL: BELLFLOWER; CITY DISPUTE OVER CAR DEALERSHIP IS SETTLED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council has agreed to accept a $700,000 out-of-court settlement from 
the Ford Motor Credit Co. to recover money the city lost when a 1991 last-ditch 
investment effort failed to keep the Pete Ellis Ford car dealership in 
business. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than go to civil trial, scheduled to have begun last week in Norwalk 
Superior Court, the council voted 3-2 to accept the settlement.One of the 
dissenters, Councilman Bill Pendleton, said he thought the city should have 
sought punitive damages before a jury. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, the council issued the troubled Ellis dealership a $400,000 
interest-free loan and a $300,000 grant, both from the city's federal Housing 
and Urban Development funds. Council members said at the time that saving the 
jobs of low- and moderate-income wage earners was an appropriate use of the 
federal funding. In addition, they were trying to save one of Bellflower's 
largest producers of sales tax revenue -- about $300,000 a year at its highest 
point -- from going bankrupt. 
</P>
<P>
 After Pete Ellis closed the dealership abruptly in June, 1991, the city sued 
him and Ford Motor Credit Co., alleging that he had misrepresented his 
financial status and that Ford had reneged on its commitment to help Ellis stay 
in business. Mike Egan, deputy city administrator, said that the city's 
litigation expenses have totaled about $400,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Ellis has filed for personal bankruptcy, said Richard L. Stone, an attorney 
for Ford Motor Credit Co. Stone also confirmed the settlement with Bellflower. 
</P>
<P>
 A new car dealership, Ford West, opened in 1992 on the Ellis site, and is 
expected to generate about $300,000 a year in sales-tax revenue, Egan said.

CITY HALL JOURNAL: LONG BEACH; CITY WON'T PAVE THE WAY FOR ASPHALT RECYCLER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EMILY ADAMS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Residents of a North Long Beach neighborhood won the first round of their 
fight to keep an asphalt recycling plant out of their area when city planning 
commissioners voted down the project, 4-1. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys for EcoPave recycling said they plan to appeal the decision to the 
City Council, according to Lisa Heep, city zoning administrator.EcoPave 
President Steven Vance could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the neighborhood around the 6100 block of Paramount Boulevard is zoned 
for light industrial use and EcoPave's operation is considered heavy 
industrial, plant owners needed both a conditional-use permit and a 
modification of the general plan before setting up shop. Planning commissioners 
rejected both requests last week. 
</P>
<P>
 About 20 residents spoke against the proposed plant, claiming the asphalt 
recycling would create too much noise and smell and increase truck traffic. 
They were joined by administrators of nearby Charter Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Warren Harwood also opposed the plant. "We all think it is a bit of 
a stinker," he said. EMILY ADAMS

CITY HALL JOURNAL: LONG BEACH; COUNCIL APPROVES MONEY FOR SEA HABITAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN POPE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council has approved a half-acre habitat for sea life in the Marine 
Stadium waterway near Alamitos Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 The $250,000 habitat will replace a marine area that was destroyed four years 
ago by a new concrete wall built along the south side of Alamitos Bay in 
preparation for construction of the proposed Olympic Sailing Center.About 6,500 
square feet of bay bottom was removed in the construction. The area had 
supported a halibut breeding ground, ghost shrimp, eel grass, worms and plants. 
State law requires that destroyed marine habitats must be replaced.  
</P>
<P>
 The center, which would be a training area for Olympic sailing competitors, 
was approved by the City Council in November and awaits approval of the 
California Coastal Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 The new habitat will be built at the northern edge of Marine Stadium, called 
End Beach. Construction is scheduled to begin in June. No date has been set for 
completion. JOHN POPE

AUDIT FINDS IRREGULARITIES AT ACADEMY; FINANCE: LYNWOOD'S ENTREPRENEUR PROGRAM 
MAINTAINED INADEQUATE CONTROL OF $2 MILLION FROM THE CITY TO HELP AID NEW 
BUSINESSES, STUDY CONCLUDES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JILL GOTTESMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Lynwood business academy kept shoddy records and maintained inadequate 
control of nearly $2 million in public funds that it received from the city, a 
private auditing firm has concluded. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson and Simpson, hired early last year to audit the Entrepreneur 
Development Academy of California during its first 18 months of operation, 
found duplicate payments of a $31,000 bill for computer equipment, insufficient 
documentation to support thousands of dollars in expenses and payments to 
academy officials that may constitute conflicts of interest. 
</P>
<P>
 Auditors also found two contracts detailing vastly different obligations for 
the city to fund the academy. Under one contract, the city's redevelopment 
agency would provide $4 million to the academy over a five-year period. Under 
the other contract, the city would provide about $14.5 million in funding over 
40 years. Auditors suggested the city seek legal advice to determine which 
contract is valid. 
</P>
<P>
 The academy was set up in 1991 to provide free training to fledgling local 
entrepreneurs. The academy offered owners of new businesses free courses, 
training, office space and clerical support until the businesses were strong 
enough to operate on their own, preferably in Lynwood. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's redevelopment agency in July, 1991, approved $2 million in funding, 
including a $1.5-million interest-free loan to be repaid over 40 years. Most of 
the city money was earmarked to renovate two buildings in the city to house 
these "incubator businesses."  
</P>
<P>
 But the auditors found that nearly half of the $1.5 million was paid to the 
executive director, the board of advisers or small-business owners who set up 
shop at the academy. Executive Director Jess Arnold was paid $97,500 from July, 
1991, until he retired in August, 1992. Other board members or business owners 
were paid amounts ranging from $33,306 to $174,781 during an 18-month period. 
The audit did not describe the nature of the payments. 
</P>
<P>
 The auditors questioned some of these expenditures, but City Manager Faustin 
Gonzales said some of the spending was encouraged. "These business people were 
supposed to be funded by the academy," he said. Arnold could not be reached for 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Some city officials expressed dissatisfaction with the audit, claiming it did 
not determine how thousands of dollars were spent by the now-defunct Lynwood 
Manufacturing Co., which received $694,800 for machinery but never opened. The 
machine shop was to have been one of the academy's anchor businesses and its 
profits were to have been used to help make the academy self-supporting. 
</P>
<P>
 An investigation by The Times found the company's owner, Richard Calhoun, 
apparently used much of the city's money to pay personal debts, including an 
Internal Revenue Service bill. The investigation also found that Calhoun spent 
only $300,000 of the $694,800 on the equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 Calhoun has denied any wrongdoing but has declined to discuss with The Times 
the payments to the IRS or other expenditures. Calhoun halted his manufacturing 
effort after 10 months and turned over the machinery to the academy in July, 
1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The audit, released last week, was criticized by Councilman Robert Henning. 
"There are still too many unanswered questions about this thing," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The auditors said they could not review the operations of the defunct 
manufacturing company because they were not provided any of its financial 
records. 
</P>
<P>
 Henning and Councilman Armando Rea said they may take legal action to block 
additional city funding to the academy. Last February, the council decided to 
give the academy another $225,000 for rent, tuition and training of incubator 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 The academy has been renamed and restructured. Now the Lynwood Entrepreneur 
Development Academy, it has a new board of directors and a new business plan 
that city officials said will have tighter controls on how the money is spent.  
</P>
<P>
 "We haven't got all the assurances that we need yet, but we are working on 
them," Gonzales said. "We realize that precious little tracking has been done 
for the institute. That will change." 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Paul H. Richards II has consistently defended the academy, which he said 
has launched dozens of businesses in the community and surrounding areas. He 
has vowed to continue its funding.  
</P>
<P>
 "It is probably one of the greatest things that has ever happened to this 
community," Richards said previously in response to reports of questionable 
spending at the academy. "The benefits have far exceeded all anticipated 
results. That's a good feeling."

TRAVELING TOY BEAR HELPS OPEN UP WORLD TO CLASS; EDUCATION: SCOOTER'S JOURNEY 
TO SEVEN STATES AND EUROPE HELPS GIVE GEOGRAPHY LESSONS TO STUDENTS AT ST. 
ANTHONY ELEMENTARY SCHOOL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 He stands only 2 feet tall, weighs no more than 5 pounds and is stuffed with 
cotton. 
</P>
<P>
 But Scooter the Bear has been quite the world traveler since September, 
canvassing the globe as an ambassador, sightseer and co-geography teacher to 
the eighth-grade class at St. Anthony Elementary School in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Teacher Chad Laines decided to enliven his geography lessons by sending the 
bear on an experimental journey in September. The students armed Scooter with a 
note explaining the project, a set of stamped, pre-addressed postcards, a 
backpack and travel journal. Scooter's traveling companions were asked to send 
the postcards, deposit souvenirs in the backpack, and record their experiences 
in the journal. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time Scooter returned to class last month, the cards and journal 
revealed he had traversed at least seven states and eight European countries. 
The light-gray bear had accumulated a wealth of treasures in his backpack, 
including currency from Poland, a beer mug from Sweden (allegedly grabbed after 
a night of heavy partying with some female companions in Stockholm) and a shirt 
from Greece. 
</P>
<P>
 Laines came up with the idea for the project with his wife, Annie, who works 
as a flight attendant for Delta Airlines.  
</P>
<P>
 So on Sept. 24, Scooter, well, scooted off from Los Angeles International 
Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 Annie Laines gave the bear to a young girl on her way from Los Angeles to 
Portland. After that, Scooter was on his own. 
</P>
<P>
 The postcards allowed students to trace Scooter's progress on a map, while 
they studied the geographic, historic and cultural differences of the places he 
visited. 
</P>
<P>
 But the journal revealed a more complete picture of his travels: 
</P>
<P>
 "Today, my family and I are going to Orlando (Florida) to spend five days at 
Disney World and to see other things," one girl wrote. "My little brother has 
cancer and the Make-A-Wish Foundation granted him his wish to see Mickey Mouse. 
It's great to have you flying with us." 
</P>
<P>
 In another entry, dated Oct. 14: 
</P>
<P>
 "I am flying home from Russia where I was born one month ago. I have been 
adopted by an American family from New York City. . . . My name is Vanessa and 
I was born in L'Vov, Ukraine, where my birth mother had no money to support me. 
I know I will have a happy life in America." 
</P>
<P>
 Other entries were unsigned and written as if in Scooter's voice: 
</P>
<P>
 "Here I am in glorious ancient Rome. . . . most impressive are the ancient 
Roman ruins of the Forum, the Colosseum, the Pantheon and the Baths of 
Caracalla," reads one entry. In another, from Greece, ". . . On Thursday we 
went to Hydra where we went on a tour of the island on a donkey." 
</P>
<P>
 Many of Scooter's companions gave detailed descriptions of geography, 
population, natural resources and other facts about the countries they saw. One 
entry written on a flight to Moscow outlines the relationship of the former 
republics. 
</P>
<P>
 "With the volatile political situation in the former Soviet Union, this gave 
me an opportunity to teach about that and put it in some perspective," Laines 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Laines, 29, said he was pleased that the experiment worked. The bear's return 
helped restore some of his "faith in human nature," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I liked the suspense," 13-year-old Manuel Chavez said. "We were always 
thinking (Scooter) wasn't going to make it." 
</P>
<P>
 Laines' students are eager to send the bear on his way again, possibly through 
Asia or South America. But their teacher is not sure he wants to press his 
luck, especially after Scooter disappeared for two months during his maiden 
voyage. 
</P>
<P>
 The class had stopped receiving postcards in October, and Scooter was not 
heard from until Jan. 6, when Laines received a call from the LAX baggage 
department. 
</P>
<P>
 Scooter was sitting in a cardboard box, unharmed. 
</P>
<P>
 The students breathed a collective sigh of relief upon Scooter's return, but 
Laines said he is still baffled. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd love to know what happened during that time (before January)," Laines 
said. Since Scooter's tag requested he be returned to Los Angeles by Jan. 1, 
Laines said he figures someone probably returned the bear early.

MYSTERY-LOVERS' BOOKSTORE DIES -- THE ECONOMY DID IT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EMILY ADAMS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sitting in the wing-back chair in front of a crackling, simulated fire, one 
could sometimes hear the lonely wail of the hounds of the Baskervilles. Big Ben 
chimed in the distance. 
</P>
<P>
 But the dogs and bells, which helped create the mysterious atmosphere of 
Sherlock's Home bookstore in Long Beach, were quieted last weekend when the 
shop's doors closed for the last time. 
</P>
<P>
 The Victorian mantel, claw-foot tables and comfy chairs where customers could 
curl up with the latest spine-tingler have been sold, ending the 15-year run of 
the popular mystery-theme bookstore in the Naples area.  
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to create a home for all detectives and enthusiasts," said owner 
Beth Caswell. "But I just can't compete with the discount bookstores anymore. 
It's very sad." 
</P>
<P>
 Caswell said she opened Sherlock's Home out of frustration. She found few 
knowledgeable booksellers when she went shopping for new mysteries to read -- 
gentle detectives for herself, hard-boiled sleuths for her husband. Only two or 
three bookstores in the country were dedicated to mysteries, Caswell said. 
</P>
<P>
 So, using her love of theater and books, Caswell created the store she dreamed 
of. The books were identified by category: Victorians, Junior Sleuth (as in 
Nancy Drew and the Hardy Boys), Sherlock Holmes, True Crime, Vampires. The 
section called Gentle Mayhem displayed books where "someone probably got boshed 
on the head in the library while someone else was having sherry with the 
vicar," Caswell said. 
</P>
<P>
 Customers were invited to sit in antique chairs at the hearth, where the 
sounds of a crackling fire, Big Ben and distant hounds were piped in. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990, on the 100th anniversary of Agatha Christie's birth, Caswell hosted a 
tea for 250, and hired an actress to play the intrepid detective Miss Marple. 
</P>
<P>
 Sherlock's Home was also where local mystery writers often got their first 
hearing. Authors such as Gary Amo, Larry Taylor and Wendy Hornsby became 
regulars. Customers heard excerpts of Jan Burke's "Good Night, Irene" before 
publication. 
</P>
<P>
 While the store gained in popularity, building a mailing list of 5,000 
international customers who snatched up books and memorabilia such as replicas 
of the Maltese Falcon, Caswell's bottom line was suffering. 
</P>
<P>
 She lost some customers after moving to a larger store on Anaheim Street about 
eight years ago, Caswell said. She returned to 2nd Street in Naples in 1992, 
but the deepening recession and new discount bookstores cut severely into her 
profits. 
</P>
<P>
 Caswell hopes to continue a mystery series, aired on the city's public-access 
cable channel, where she looks for ghosts, interviews real private 
investigators and reads. But Sherlock's Home is closed for good, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was a wonderful experience and I learned a lot," Caswell said. "But I'm 
done with retail. It's just too hard a row to hoe."

COMMUNITY NEWS: NORWALK; FAMILY ERECTS MEMORIAL FOR MAN KILLED BY FIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A year has passed since his father died in a suspicious blaze at his Norwalk 
home, but Joseph Gutierrez Jr. refused to let the anniversary go unnoticed. 
</P>
<P>
 Gutierrez and his wife, Diane, unveiled a makeshift memorial last month that 
towers over the charred home: a flagpole fashioned out of old steel pipes found 
in his father's garage.The pipes were welded together and painted white. Then 
the couple quietly raised an American flag, which the family had received as a 
tribute to Joseph Gutierrez Sr.'s years in the armed services. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had to do something (to mark the day)," Gutierrez said.  
</P>
<P>
 Gutierrez said he hopes the flag might encourage witnesses who might have 
information about his father's murder to contact authorities.  
</P>
<P>
 Joseph Gutierrez Sr., known around the neighborhood as "Pops" or "Chino," 
often fed and sheltered transients who wandered over from the nearby railroad 
tracks. Many of them are still around, and might have seen something that 
January night, Gutierrez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Law enforcement officials believe the fire was arson.

COMMUNITY NEWS: DOWNEY; SCHOOLS EXPECTED TO BAN GANG-TYPE ATTIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Downey school board members are expected to vote Tuesday to outlaw baggy pants 
in an attempt to discourage gang activity on campus. 
</P>
<P>
 The Downey Unified School District board last week directed staff members to 
draw up a new dress code policy that bans any apparel, including oversized 
pants and shirts, determined by law enforcement officials to be gang-related.In 
the past, the district's dress code policy has banned only symbols or signs 
that are believed to be gang-related, Deputy Supt. Donna Boose said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Downey schools are also surveying parents to determine whether there is 
enough support for a policy that would require all elementary students to wear 
uniforms. Officials at Price Elementary School are considering a pilot project 
to require uniforms for all students beginning in September, Boose said.

</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>

COMMUNITY NEWS: SIGNAL HILL; 2 SUSPECTS ARRESTED IN CARJACKING ATTEMPT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The two carjackers approached the 49-year-old woman in the parking garage, 
demanded her keys and purse, and prepared to drive off in her car. 
</P>
<P>
 That's when their planned heist began to unravel last Thursday.They didn't 
have a remote control to open the parking garage gate. 
</P>
<P>
 "They couldn't find the control and started to panic," said David M. Singer, 
deputy police chief. The men ran through the condominium complex in the 2100 
block of Hill Street, and across a dirt field, Singer said.  
</P>
<P>
 Police arrested two men at 20th Street and Raymond Avenue. One suspect, 
Carlton Lee Vereen, 18, of Long Beach was charged with carjacking, robbery, 
burglary, assault with a deadly weapon and possession of a stolen handgun. The 
other suspect, a 17-year-old whose name was not released because of his age, is 
being held while authorities determine if he can be tried as an adult, Singer 
said.

COMMUNITY NEWS: LYNWOOD; RUNOFF ELECTION TUESDAY FOR SCHOOL BOARD SEAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Voters will attempt to break a tie Tuesday between two incumbents for a seat 
on the Lynwood Unified School District board. 
</P>
<P>
 A special election is being held to decide whether incumbent Rachel Chavez or 
Joe T. Battle will serve another term.Each received 1,281 votes in the Nov. 2 
school board race, just behind newcomer Laura M. Byrd. The three were competing 
for two seats. Byrd was sworn into office in December. Trustees decided on a 
special runoff to break the tie between Chavez and Battle, but will allow both 
incumbents to remain until then. The decision temporarily left the district 
with six board members. 
</P>
<P>
 Chavez, 55, a homemaker, former adult education teacher and the board's only 
Latina, has served one term. Battle, 52, an Internal Revenue Service manager, 
is seeking his fourth term. 
</P>
<P>
 Polls will be open from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m.

 She had worked for a mining company for eight years, keeping track of 
employeerecords, when her boss called her in and said she no longer had a job. 
Today, Lori Quon runs a balloon business from a bedroom in her Cerritos home. 
She's gearing up for Valentine's Day, stuffing balloons with roses and teddy 
bears. 
</P>
<P>
 For seven years, he was an engineer for an aircraft company. After Kalim Mian 
got his pink slip, he converted the den of his Norwalk home into an office. He 
mails out brochures to airlines, hoping they will sign him up to design wiring 
inside planes or test cockpit controls and other electrical gadgets. 
</P>
<P>
 Quon and Mian are among a growing number of workers in the Southeast and Long 
Beach areas who began anew in their homes after losing their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other new entrepreneurs is a former telephone operator who sells costume 
jewelry -- wood-beaded necklaces, gold-plated bracelets and glass earrings -- 
from a shelf in her Compton home. 
</P>
<P>
 A construction planner whose job was eliminated at General Electric now prints 
signs and posters in his Whittier home. He converted the den into a design 
studio with a drafting table and oversized copy machine. 
</P>
<P>
 A former security expert at Northrop rebuilds cartridges for laser printers in 
his Lakewood garage. His work counter is a mix of plastic screws, boxes of 
bolts and bottles of ink toner. 
</P>
<P>
 Although there are no specific figures to support an increase in such 
ventures, local chamber of commerce officials say many of their new members 
work from home. There also is a great deal of anecdotal evidence that home 
businesses are on the rise. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a sea of us out there," said Carol Tober, a onetime Rockwell employee 
who now sells nontoxic cleaning products and long-distance telephone service 
from her Lakewood home. 
</P>
<P>
 Many welcome their new line of work, seeing in it a chance to escape humdrum 
routines and fulfill dreams of being their own bosses. But others opted for the 
home office as a last resort -- after failing repeatedly to land jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Some have trouble adjusting to working alone at home, cut off from their 
former co-workers. New distractions -- the kids playing games in the living 
room, trips to the store -- interfere with work. 
</P>
<P>
 Few of the domestic entrepreneurs earn as much as they did at their previous 
jobs. Some are struggling to pay their bills and cutting back on essential 
items. Tober goes without health insurance. A Lakewood couple stopped buying 
new clothes. One man has put his home up for sale after pouring thousands of 
dollars into a struggling venture. Another, who used to buy a new car every 
four years whether he needed it or not, has held onto his latest model for 
seven years and plans to keep it a few more. 
</P>
<P>
 But many say the benefits of being on their own far outweigh the financial 
drawbacks. 
</P>
<P>
 Burt M. Bailey, who was laid off 2 1/2 years ago by Wang Laboratories in Los 
Angeles, says he is delighted to be working out of his home in Lakewood. He has 
escaped layers of bureaucracy at the huge computer company and the hassles of a 
90-minute commute each way. 
</P>
<P>
 He has traded in his suits and ties, which cost nearly $5,000 a year, for 
slacks and open-collar shirts. And he no longer contends with the uncertainty 
of rounds of layoffs at Wang, of not knowing whether he will be employed in six 
months. 
</P>
<P>
 At Wang, Bailey was in charge of the office that demonstrated new products for 
corporate customers. He spent about six months looking for work after he was 
laid off. But when a headhunter told him there were no openings for mid-level 
managers in the computer industry, Bailey decided to move full time into a 
consulting business that he had been operating on the side.  
</P>
<P>
 Bailey converted his master bedroom into a high-tech office filled with two 
computers and five printers that spit out 5,000 sheets of correspondence a 
month. He runs seminars for businesses that want to improve customer service 
and product presentations, among other things. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm working a lot more hours now, but I'm finding my stress level is a lot 
lower," said Bailey, 46, wearing jeans and cotton socks in his office. "All the 
energy I was using to fight the internal politics at work is gone. Now I spend 
my energy working for people." 
</P>
<P>
 Sheila Shouse's layoff last May gave the feisty Long Beach entrepreneur a 
chance to pursue a more creative line of work. During her 15 years at GTE in 
Norwalk, Shouse worked in a cubicle arranging service for long-distance phone 
companies such as MCI.  
</P>
<P>
 Today, Shouse spends her days taking people shopping for new wardrobes in 
malls and garment districts, or picking through a client's closets in search of 
inexpensive outfits that match. She also advises job hunters how to dress for 
interviews. FHP Inc. in Cerritos and several branches of Coast Federal Bank are 
among the clients that pay up to $100 an hour for her advice. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel like a door has swung open and I have all this opportunity ahead," 
said Shouse, 36. "I thought I was going to fall flat on my face and (have) 
nothing to show for my efforts. But this is the best thing I ever did." 
</P>
<P>
 But working from home has presented Shouse and others with new challenges. 
People who once enjoyed chatting by the office coffee machine now find 
themselves isolated from colleagues. They also have found it difficult to 
separate work from family, particularly when the office is just a few feet from 
the kids, the kitchen and the television. 
</P>
<P>
 Mian, a former engineer at McDonnell Douglas in Long Beach, often worked hours 
on end with fellow engineers, testing the reliability of cockpit controls and 
other electrical parts. Now, his day is interrupted by trips to the drugstore 
or the market. In the afternoon, when his children arrive home from school, he 
hears the thud of the basketball on the driveway outside his Norwalk home. 
</P>
<P>
 So Mian sometimes works from 9 p.m. and until 3 a.m, the only time when he can 
get "peace, quiet and calm." 
</P>
<P>
 He says he plans to rent office space as soon as he can afford it. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who have been working on their own have discovered another pitfall: Good 
intentions and long hours on the job do not guarantee financial success. 
</P>
<P>
 Quon has been working at home for more than year and has yet to earn enough to 
cover her $6,000 investment in balloons, an inflating machine and a daylong 
training course. 
</P>
<P>
 Quon said she chose the business after seeing a demonstration at a business 
fair, and because she thought there would be a demand for balloons. But it has 
been difficult getting out the word on a shoestring budget. Her promotional 
efforts have consisted of placing ads in throwaway brochures on grocery store 
racks and displaying balloons at business shows sponsored by the Cerritos 
Chamber of Commerce at local restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
 A 10-foot-high balloon coconut tree, built for a New Year's Eve party, sits in 
the middle of her living room, the balloons wilting like raisins. She reclaimed 
the creation after the party so that she can reuse its metal frame. She is 
gearing up for Valentine's Day, hoping that customers will buy balloons filled 
with teddy bears, lingerie, boxer shorts or roses. She put her creations on 
display at a bridal fair last weekend at a Cerritos hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 But Quon also is looking for another job. "I don't know if this was in the 
plan, to have a college degree (in business management) and be doing balloon 
decoration," said Quon, 34. "I probably should be working in the corporate 
world." 
</P>
<P>
 She and her husband, a car mechanic in Cerritos, live on his salary. 
</P>
<P>
 Many new entrepreneurs discover that years of technical training and academic 
degrees haven't prepared them for the demands of running a business. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Mieir, who designed graphics and forms in Downey for Security Pacific 
Bank, says he brought little sales experience to his new venture, printing 
logos on T-shirts and other clothing. To find customers, Mieir jots down the 
names of businesses from storefronts and newspaper articles, then calls the 
owners to see if they are interested in his merchandise. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a hit-and-miss strategy, resulting in a sales about one once in five 
tries, he said. "When I started cold-calling people, I was fumbling all over 
the place," said Mieir, 35. 
</P>
<P>
 Mieir operates the venture with his wife, Nancy, a former systems planner at 
Northrop, who keeps the books. Both lost their jobs last June, one day before 
their wedding. They invested $5,000 in the silk-screen machine that occupies 
the second bedroom in their Lakewood condominium, and have earned about $1,000 
since they opened for business last October. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim, a Whittier resident who designs signs and posters at home, says he also 
is struggling because he lacks experience. As a project planner for General 
Electric, Jim coordinated the work of engineers and contractors so that 
construction of power plants ran on schedule. Jim, who asked that his last name 
not be used, left his job in El Monte four years ago under a voluntary layoff 
program -- choosing to retire rather than accept a transfer. 
</P>
<P>
 He invested $40,000 in printing materials and equipment, including an 
extra-large copier. But he didn't know enough about the business to buy 
equipment that produces vinyl signs, which are in high demand. His sales 
haven't topped $1,000 a month, which is less than a quarter of what he made at 
his old job. He plans to put his four-bedroom house in Whittier up for sale, 
and is looking for another job. His wife is a homemaker and his two children, 
ages 18 and 20, are living at home and relying on scholarships or part-time 
work to help pay tuition at local community colleges. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm at the point where I need to get some ongoing income at a regular job so 
I can survive," said Jim, 50. "It's very hard not to get depressed about going 
out there and getting (job) interviews. You almost get paralyzed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wish that everybody who goes into business (for themselves) could sit down 
and talk to 10 people like me."  
</P>
<P>
 Economists say it can take years before a business establishes a loyal 
following. Start-up ventures face competition from larger companies, and 
generally have insufficient funds to advertise and expand.  
</P>
<P>
 "The cash flow is very irregular," said Joseph Wahed, chief economist for 
Wells Fargo Bank. "You can be successful for a few months, then no orders come 
for three months." 
</P>
<P>
 Those who succeed, often do so because they have built up their businesses on 
the side while working at their regular jobs full time. When they leave those 
jobs, they will already have established a base of clients. 
</P>
<P>
 "They know their markets, they have a handle on what their competitors are 
doing and where there might be a niche or a hole to fill," said Jon P. Goodman, 
director of the Entrepreneur Program at USC's School of Business 
Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 Bailey, the former Wang employee, started a part-time consulting business 
about six years before he lost his job. Now, he can barely keep up with his 14 
accounts, and is even thinking of hiring two workers to run some of his 
seminars. He expects to earn more than $45,000 this year working for clients 
such as State Farm Insurance, Norwalk Toyota and Cerritos Ford Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 "Business is good right now," Bailey said. "My only failing is that I can't 
keep up with the referrals." 
</P>
<P>
 Employment counselors who train small-business people say that banks could 
help entrepreneurs such as Bailey by loosening requirements to get loans. Most 
banks lend money to small companies only if they have been in business at least 
two years, can show they are profitable and have collateral, said Patricia 
Ayres, an assistant vice president for Wells Fargo Bank. Wells Fargo requires 
that businesses applying for loans be operating for three years and show a 
profit for two years, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The banks are often reluctant to take on such enterprises because they are 
risky, the experts say. One in four new small businesses folds after two years, 
and half of them close after four years, said Bruce D. Phillips, acting 
director of the Office of Economic Research for the U.S. Small Business 
Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, economists say that home businesses inject money into the local economy 
by hiring extra employees and contracting for services such as printing and 
photography. At the very least, the experts say, people who would otherwise be 
standing in unemployment lines are creating jobs for themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Mian of Norwalk even plans to compete with his former employer, McDonnell 
Douglas, for engineering contracts. He says he can beat their prices because of 
his low overhead. He hopes to have customers by June. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a matter of telling them what I can do for them and how they can save," 
Mian said. "Once I start having positive feedback, I think the business will 
take off."

SLOW PACE ALMOST KILLS 'UNEXPECTED GUEST' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK CHALON SMITH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "The Unexpected Guest" is not one of Agatha Christie's more gripping plays. 
Despite a ready corpse, it takes a while to get going; it's a slow train 
chugging up whodunit hill. 
</P>
<P>
 The ride seems especially long at the Long Beach Playhouse, where director 
Michael David Fox keeps pulling back on the throttle. The deliberate-to-tardy 
pacing hardly complements the mystery, which has more talk and less wit than 
any of Christie's other solve-the-puzzle adventures. 
</P>
<P>
 The production, at the Playhouse's Mainstage Theatre, does get some needed 
propulsion from a couple of actors. Allen Moon doesn't make his appearance 
until the first act is almost over, but better late than never. As the 
half-brother of the murdered Richard Warwick (Rick Buckley), Moon brings a 
gleeful, rambunctious quality to the proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
 Dan Renkin, as a Keats-loving bohemian of a police sergeant, also provides a 
welcome blast of enthusiasm. He's funny and energetic -- adjectives that rarely 
can be applied to the rest of this cast. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At the center of the muted mayhem are Michael Starkwedder (Gary Page), who 
just happens to stumble on the murder at the play's start, and pretty Laura 
Warwick (Natasha Witkin), a bitter wife quick to confess to the killing of her 
husband. Starkwedder, not the brainiest of unexpected guests, decides to help 
her, even with the noose hanging nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 Lurking about is Julian (Ron Graham), Laura's lover, and a host of other odd 
folks who muddy the waters on our way to figuring out who the real murderer is. 
Page, Witkin and Graham are competent but not colorful enough to maintain our 
interest as the somewhat Byzantine plot develops. 
</P>
<P>
 Technically, the production looks a bit budget-minded for the Long Beach 
Playhouse, which has offered some impressive stagings recently. Steven Jay 
Warner's set of the Warrick estate is passable, but it's more what you'd expect 
from a smaller community theater. We really don't get a sense of the musty 
opulence of the place, although the study leading to the foggy grounds is 
effectively moody. 
</P>
<P>
 Lonnie Alcaraz's shadowy lighting is appropriately mysterious. But Ann Curry's 
costumes, although they try to evoke the period, look a tad slapdash. 
</P>
<P>
 * "The Unexpected Guest," Long Beach Playhouse Mainstage Theatre, 5021 E. 
Anaheim St.; through Feb. 19; Friday and Saturday at 8 p.m. and Sunday at 2 
p.m.; (310) 494-1616. ($10) Running time: 2 hours.

 PREPS 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, the Long Beach Poly football team has produced as many college 
football players as any school in the Southeast/Long Beach area. 
</P>
<P>
 This year is no exception. Five players from last season's team have signed 
national letters of intent to play for Division I schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Leading the way were linebacker Danjuan Magee, who signed last week with UCLA, 
and defensive lineman Brandon Whiting, who opted for California. Both players 
made The Times' Terrific 22 preseason team last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Other Poly players who signed were defensive backs Kelly Malveaux with 
Arizona, Lamont Morgan with Arizona State and Damien Murphy with San Diego 
State. 
</P>
<P>
 La Mirada had three players sign: offensive lineman Ben Adams with Texas, 
defensive lineman Jerry Lemon with Fresno State and defensive lineman Ken Watts 
with Utah State. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, lineman Darryl Jones of Brethren Christian signed with Washington 
State and teammate Reggie Davis, a defensive back, opted for Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Other players to sign with Division I schools: linebacker Jason Reynolds of 
St. Paul with Arizona State, running back Jarvis Watson of Warren and defensive 
back Javelin Guidry of Gahr with UCLA, wide receiver Sean Williams of Dominguez 
with Oregon State, defensive back Joe Austin of Lynwood with Kansas and 
linebacker Don Sams of Long Beach Jordan with San Jose State. COLLEGES 
</P>
<P>
 The NCAA defending champion Long Beach State women's volleyball team has 
signed three high school players to national letters of intent. 
</P>
<P>
 Kristin Harris, a 5-foot-10 outside hitter from Piedmont Hills High in San 
Jose, Nique Crump, a 6-1 middle blocker from Mesa High in Arizona and Lori 
Price, a 5-11 setter from Corona Del Sol High in Tempe, Ariz., will join the 
49ers in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Brian Gimmillaro said the players should play as freshman. Three 
starters from the national championship team, including player of the year 
Danielle Scott, a middle blocker, have used up their eligibility. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to have to rely more on these incoming freshmen next year than 
we've ever had to during the past seven years," Gimmillaro said. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 After two road losses, the Long Beach State men's basketball team will play 
host to Pacific and San Jose State in Big West Conference games tonight and 
Saturday at the Gold Mine. 
</P>

PEOPLE: VOLUNTEER LENDS A HAND BY REPAIRING WHEELCHAIRS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Freeman Arnold has always been willing to help out. When an auto accident left 
a family friend a quadriplegic, Arnold helped dress him, feed him and get him 
in and out of a wheelchair. 
</P>
<P>
 Now he is doing his friend another favor: repairing wheelchairs for the 
disabled. 
</P>
<P>
 Once every month, Arnold sets up shop in a parking lot at 1600 Alameda St. in 
Compton and repairs wheelchairs for free. He asks only that people supply 
needed parts. He'll do the rest. "I'll help anybody if they're willing to help 
themselves," said Arnold, 65, who ran a floor-covering business before 
retiring. 
</P>
<P>
 Arnold is a volunteer with Personal Care Technology, a nonprofit organization 
founded three years ago by Arnold's quadriplegic friend, Ernest T. Hamilton, to 
provide the disabled with home care and wheelchair repair. 
</P>
<P>
 "I noticed the guys (in rehabilitation) having a lot of trouble retaining 
people in the home to take care of them, and getting their wheelchairs 
repaired, " Hamilton said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hamilton suffered a spinal cord injury in a car accident about 15 years ago, 
shortly after he left the U.S. Air Force. For years, Arnold drove Hamilton to 
the Veteran's Administration Hospital two and three times a week. 
</P>
<P>
 After Arnold retired, he took his friend's suggestion that he become a 
volunteer for Personal Care and be trained to repair wheelchairs. Arnold took a 
course at the Veteran's Administration hospital in Long Beach, three days a 
week, four hours a day, for 3 1/2 months. 
</P>
<P>
 "If he can help you, he will, and he won't ask for money," Hamilton said. "It 
makes him feel good just to help." 
</P>
<P>
 Arnold, who lives on a pension but has minimal expenses, echoed his friend's 
observation. "I don't need the money," Arnold said. "I don't have a car note, 
or a house note. My rent is only $350 a month. Some days I don't have anything 
to do. This gives me something to do." 
</P>
<P>
 In the future, Arnold said, he hopes to train others to repair wheelchairs, 
then turn his attention to learning how to write grant proposals for the 
organization, which would use the money to expand.

EDUCATION: A PLEA FOR HONORS PROGRAMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Parents of Schurr High School honors students are concerned about cutbacks in 
funding for honors classes, advanced-placement classes, gifted cluster classes 
and, especially, the former full-time college-university counselor position. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Montebello Unified School District Board of Education fails to restore 
funding to those four areas, it will deny and deprive Schurr students an 
opportunity for outstanding academic achievement, and will deny them entry into 
colleges and universities because they will not be able to compete successfully 
against other California students. 
</P>
<P>
 All students who demonstrate the ability should be aggressively encouraged to 
enroll in honors courses and to pursue the highest of academic achievement. 
Montebello and Bell Gardens high schools also should be funded adequately for 
honors programs. It is vital to society, the tax structure and the ability of 
the United States to compete in the global arena. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, Schurr High School has shown an outstanding record in academic 
levels. Of the Class of 1993, graduated last June, 37% enrolled in a four-year 
college or university; 55% enrolled in a two-year college or technical 
training. Those levels can and should be raised. 
</P>
<P>
 For the last five school years, including the 1993-94 year, Schurr High School 
has produced 19 students with the distinction of National Merit Finalist. 
Without ongoing support through honors classes and a full-time 
college-university counselor, this level cannot be maintained. Right now the 
next two classes of seniors coming up are in danger of failing to maintain the 
rhythm and momentum established by past Schurr High School classes. Already, it 
has been discovered that in general they have lower scores and fewer high 
scorers on the Preliminary Scholastic Aptitude Test. 
</P>
<P>
 We cannot allow budget shortfall excuses to lower the level of academic 
achievement in any school.

CHOREOGRAPHER STIRS UP SPECIAL 'GUMBO'; DANCE: UC IRVINE'S DONALD MCKAYLE 
UNVEILS A NEW WORK COMMISSIONED BY THE KENNEDY CENTER FOR THE PERFORMING ARTS 
AND PERFORMED BY SAN FRANCISCO BALLET. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Moments before dress rehearsal for his newest creation, Donald McKayle 
presided over the backstage frenzy with calm reserve. 
</P>
<P>
 He was preparing for tonight, when the distinguished San Francisco Ballet, the 
country's oldest ballet troupe, will give the first performance of his "Gumbo 
Ya-Ya." A 30-minute work for 18 dancers that deals with human reaction to 
catastrophe, it was commissioned by the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts 
in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 McKayle -- a professor of dance at UC Irvine who, at 63, has been a 
choreographer for more than four decades -- was as unfazed by the significance 
of the occasion as he was by the last-minute activity around him. Navigating a 
sea of legs -- legs encased in shiny tights, legs hoisted onto a barre, legs 
flexing in plie -- he checked costumes and answered questions that couldn't 
wait. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, yes, yes ," he murmured, beaming with satisfaction over the way a 
headdress transformed dancer Yuri Zhukov into a formidable shaman. "I have to 
go to the bathroom," said a wide-eyed waif. "Do I have time?" 
</P>
<P>
 The job description doesn't include "mother hen skills mandatory." But 
choreographers -- the dance world's equivalent of a playwright and a director 
-- know that mothering can go right along with creating a work's concept and 
steps, coming up with the appropriate music, helping to design sets and 
costumes, and showing dancers the previously untried moves. 
</P>
<P>
 As McKayle told the waif with a smile, "Everyone has a crisis." 
</P>
<P>
 McKayle is a Laguna Beach resident whose credits include "Sophisticated 
Ladies," the Broadway musical for which he won one of his five Tony 
nominations, and such American modern-dance classics as "Games," his 1951 
depiction of inner-city strife. 
</P>
<P>
 The "Gumbo" project has meant time away from his dance classes and rehearsals 
at UCI, where he is creating another new piece, this one with 22 students. But 
the opportunity wasn't to be sniffed at. 
</P>
<P>
 The offer had come via San Francisco Ballet's artistic director, Helgi 
Tomasson, who had been asked to take part in the Kennedy Center Ballet 
Commissioning Project, a farsighted effort to spawn new choreography. Six 
regional American ballet companies had been chosen to produce a dance apiece, 
and each would have its world premiere at the center. 
</P>
<P>
 (A musicians strike last fall postponed "Gumbo Ya-Ya's" premiere at the center 
until May; thus, tonight's performance is being billed as a "preview." The San 
Francisco Ballet, which last appeared in Southern California at the Orange 
County Performing Arts Center in 1991, has no plans to present the work 
locally.) 
</P>
<P>
 Tomasson, who first worked with McKayle in the late 1960s, said he invited him 
aboard because he knew McKayle would come up with something good, something 
different, something that would challenge the San Francisco company. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very necessary for us to go forward and search for new works that, maybe 
years from now, will become classics," Tomasson said. 
</P>
<P>
 As McKayle explains it, Gumbo ya-ya means "everybody talk at once" in Gullah, 
an African American dialect of coastal South Carolina and Georgia, and the new 
ballet deals with how an unspecified catastrophic disaster thrusts together 
diverse groups of people. In the panic, McKayle said, "everybody is expressing 
something. Nothing is held back." 
</P>
<P>
 The work had its genesis in a visit McKayle made to Malaysia about 40 years 
ago while he was touring with the Martha Graham Dance Company. "It was such a 
verdant, lush country," he recalled, "and suddenly, I came upon a place that 
was absolutely stripped of all of its greenery. It was like someone dropped a 
bomb or something. But it was caused by open strip mining, for tin." 
</P>
<P>
 Horrified by "mankind's ability to destroy," McKayle filed the Malaysian 
memories away. They began surfacing about a year ago, as headlines about 
environmental destruction were appearing more frequently. Tomasson had just 
called about the Kennedy Center commission when McKayle heard some work by UCI 
music professor and jazz flutist James Newton, and "as I heard the music, I 
began to see a dance." 
</P>
<P>
 McKayle approached Newton. "I said to him, I've just been asked to do a 
ballet. Would you like to do a score for me?" Newton agreed and the 
collaboration began. They enlisted A. Christina Giannini, a designer from New 
York, to create sets and costumes, McKayle came up with a plot using musical 
sketches from Newton, and the creation of a 30-minute dance for 18 men and 
women to a propulsive, synthesized score was underway. 
</P>
<P>
 To create actual steps and string them together, McKayle said he follows a 
"complete" mental image of what he wants to see on stage. 
</P>
<P>
 In this case, the image included three diverse groups of people, all of whom 
live close to the earth, distinguished by their movement style: "Air people" 
are fleet and fast moving, "reed people" bend like willow branches, and "earth 
people" stay close to the ground. The image also included three main 
characters, a pair of lovers and a shaman who is looked to for a solution to 
the catastrophe. 
</P>
<P>
 During rehearsals, the movements evolved as dancers contributed their own 
ideas, with McKayle's blessing. 
</P>
<P>
 Eric Hoisington, who plays the male lover, said before the dress rehearsal 
that he has worked with about 60 choreographers and prefers those like McKayle, 
who allow him to "improvise a bit. You make it your own. It's a creative 
process for all involved." 
</P>
<P>
 "Donald said we could do whatever we wanted to extend the character," added 
Zhukov, a former member of Russia's renowned Maryinsky Ballet (previously 
called the Kirov Ballet). "He gave us freedom to develop our own individual 
expression." 
</P>
<P>
 McKayle said his approach actually has differed somewhat with each dance he 
has choreographed, but one unifying theme -- whether the work concerns itself 
with street gangs or social oppression -- has been his primary focus on human 
behavior and interaction, rather than events or polemics. 
</P>
<P>
 While "Gumbo Ya-Ya" is a clarion call against environmental destruction, 
McKayle thinks the human reaction to catastrophe is more central to his ballet. 
He thinks this "humanizing" inclination, as he calls it, developed in childhood 
when he was "taught to say thank you and listen to people, really hear what 
they were saying." It engendered a "connection to human beings." 
</P>
<P>
 Selecting choreography as a career had a lot to do with his penchant for 
people-watching. "I grew up in New York City and would always take subways and 
buses, and I was always watching people, what they were doing, little scenes 
that were going on. I remember I once watched a little old lady taking an apple 
and a knife out of her pocketbook and slowly peeling the apple, taking a slice, 
folding her handkerchief. . . . It was a beautiful little moment." 
</P>
<P>
 Further reminiscing about his early days "when there was not a penny coming 
from anyone" to support his choreographic efforts, McKayle (who has just 
written his autobiography, "I Will Dance With You," due for publication at the 
end of the year) said he is concerned about today's severe cutbacks in arts 
funding. He suggested that artists must be creative in finding financial 
backing. 
</P>
<P>
 "The final mark that's going to be left after civilization goes is going to be 
these elements of culture," he said. "So this is not something that can just be 
sloughed off."

ISRAEL AND PLO REACH PARTIAL AUTONOMY PACT; MIDEAST: PERES AND ARAFAT ALSO 
REPORT PROGRESS ON TOUGHEST ISSUES: BORDER CONTROL AND SIZE OF JERICHO AREA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 After months of haggling that threatened to paralyze hopes for Palestinian 
self-rule, Israeli and Palestinian negotiators Wednesday concluded three days 
of marathon talks and signed a preliminary agreement that overcomes many of the 
biggest obstacles to Palestinian autonomy. 
</P>
<P>
 Following an exhausting round of all-night sessions that threatened to 
collapse at the last moment, Palestine Liberation Organization Chairman Yasser 
Arafat and Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres initialed an accord on a wide 
range of issues -- from the operation of the new Palestinian governing 
authority to security for Jewish settlers in the Gaza Strip. 
</P>
<P>
 The two leaders said they also made progress on two of the most difficult 
issues plaguing a peace agreement: the control of international border 
crossings and the size of the area around the West Bank town of Jericho to be 
transferred to Palestinian authority. 
</P>
<P>
 But a final agreement on both issues, which have bedeviled the talks since 
mid-October, proved elusive, and the two sides said they will continue 
negotiating until Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin meet to sign 
a final agreement. Egyptian mediators said they hoped that meeting will take 
place "in the very near future." 
</P>
<P>
 In Washington, President Clinton praised the negotiators' work. "Another big 
milestone has been achieved today," Clinton said in remarks to Jewish leaders 
from around the world. 
</P>
<P>
 But the failure to conclude a final understanding on the two critical issues 
was an obvious setback for Arafat and Peres, who had hoped to pave the way for 
a comprehensive agreement that would permit the beginning of Israeli withdrawal 
from Jericho and the Gaza Strip. 
</P>
<P>
 Both sides emphasized, however, that major hurdles had been cleared, including 
the extremely controversial issue of security protection for Jewish settlers in 
the Gaza Strip, an issue Peres said was resolved by dividing the region into 
three separate zones. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't complete our work, but we overcame very, very difficult issues," 
Peres said. "We took five or six of the most complicated issues between two 
peoples. We could have gone the Bosnian way -- to shoot, to fight, to kill. 
Instead, we went our way -- to agree to find common grounds, to tell the 
Palestinian people, tell the Israeli people, that we are serious, we are 
credible, we are not looking for images and public relations, we are looking 
for real peace for all children in the Middle East, Arabs and Jews." 
</P>
<P>
 Arafat, who like Peres looked tired and subdued as he signed the agreement 
known as the Cairo Document, said: "We consider what we have done the last 
three days a major step for the implementation of the (Declaration of 
Principles) which we have signed in Washington. I hope very soon we will be 
able to meet together in Jericho." 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement, which was not immediately made public, is said to contain two 
documents, the first a three-page discussion of principles for Palestinian 
self-rule, the other an eight-page recitation of the points of understanding on 
some of the most difficult security issues, including the border crossings and 
the management of Jericho and the Gaza Strip. 
</P>
<P>
 The two leaders said negotiating teams will continue meeting in Egypt to try 
to work out the final points so that Arafat and Rabin can sign a final accord. 
Sources close to the talks said such an agreement is at best several weeks 
away. 
</P>
<P>
 Apart from economic talks still going on in Paris, the key security issues 
remaining include the size of the Jericho area to be governed by Palestinians. 
Negotiators in Cairo apparently were able to agree on several areas outside 
Jericho proper that Palestinians have sought to include in their zone of 
authority, but the overall size of the district remains a point of contention, 
sources close to the talks said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the two teams were able to reach only partial agreement on 
control of international border crossings into Egypt and Jordan. There still 
remains a dispute about whether a Palestinian officer will stand at the border, 
the sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 Both of these could be major issues; Arafat feels he cannot sell an already 
unpopular peace plan to his people if the size of the areas for Palestinian 
self-rule is minuscule. Moreover, Palestinians feel they need to relieve the 
humiliation that many Palestinians experience when undergoing Israeli scrutiny 
at international border points. Israel, for its part, says it cannot compromise 
its security by handing over border controls to Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
 Peres, apparently making a reference to these concerns, said each side has 
become aware of the other's priorities and sensitivities. "Before we came to 
Cairo, Chairman Arafat said that he would respect the security needs of Israel, 
and surely we cannot compromise on our security. On the other hand, we have 
announced that we shall do whatever we can to introduce an air of dignity and 
respect for the Palestinians," Peres said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know the people of Israel are seriously and deeply interested in making 
peace a reality. I'm convinced that historically and morally, we do not want to 
be the dominating force of the Palestinian people." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet for all the goodwill, the talks were strained by the press of time, the 
failure to meet an original Dec. 13 deadline for beginning Israeli troop 
withdrawal and the collapse of a tentative accord that Arafat and Peres thought 
they had reached recently in Davos, Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
 The negotiating teams met on both Monday and Tuesday nights until 3 a.m., with 
Arafat and Peres sitting through at least seven grueling sessions. Palestinian 
leaders emerged from one of the last sessions Wednesday afternoon with an 
announcement that an agreement was imminent, only to find the talks near 
collapse during a last-minute session on details Wednesday evening when Israel 
reportedly accused the Palestinians of reneging on an earlier agreement, 
according to some sources. 
</P>
<P>
 Israel Radio reported that Egyptian Foreign Minister Amir Moussa had to 
intervene when Arafat was angered that Peres had to check with Rabin in Israel 
for final authority to sign the agreement. Peres, infuriated, walked out of the 
room at one point, the radio reported. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the decision finally to sign an accord on the points agreed on and leave 
the others until later reflected the realization on both sides that backing 
away from the peace process at this point is not an easy option. Both sides, 
Peres said, realize they are sailing uncharted waters.

 A celebrated pop and folk singer during the reign of dictator Nicolae 
Ceausescu, she had been kept off the stage after emigrating to the United 
States in 1983 by a jealous husband and hard times. The woman who had once 
entertained Romanian television and nightclub audiences in seven languages 
worked here as a department store makeup artist. 
</P>
<P>
 With a turbulent marriage behind her, the 41-year-old performer was reviving 
her singing career and dreaming of opening a jazz club when her estranged 
husband, Lorel Ungureanu, gunned her down in a murder-suicide outside her home 
Jan. 28, friends and authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was so happy to be singing again," said her 22-year-old niece, Margo 
Campeanu. "That's what hurts her family the most, knowing that she was finally 
happy." 
</P>
<P>
 The slaying came just after Zoia Ungureanu had triumphantly returned to the 
stage, performing recently in what she called "comeback concerts" with other 
Romanian immigrants in Fullerton and Hollywood, said Aristide Buhoiu, editor 
and publisher of Universul, a Romanian-language newspaper based in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 While even the woman's closest neighbors in the condominium complex knew 
little about her background, the singer's death was front page news in her 
native Romania -- where she was known as Zoia Campeanu -- and to the community 
of 120,000 Romanian expatriates who live in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think people had wondered what had happened to her," said Buhoiu, who 
attended her recent performances along with hundreds of other Romanian 
immigrants. Her husband "was very jealous," Buhoiu said. "She got very isolated 
in Orange County because of her husband. But she was so happy to be up there on 
the stage again that she would not accept any money for the performances. And 
she performed great. She was still so very good." 
</P>
<P>
 As a co-worker watched, Lorel Ungureanu shot his estranged wife twice at close 
range in the parking lot outside her condominium, hitting her in the face and 
torso before turning the handgun on himself, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Zoia Ungureanu "was walking around to get in my car when she saw him," said 
Tina Browning, who had arrived just minutes before the shooting to take her 
friend to dinner. "They talked for a few minutes, then she turned away quickly 
and walked to my car. I opened the door for her. Then he walked very fast 
behind her (and) said, 'Zoia!' She turned around and he shot her and shot her 
again." 
</P>
<P>
 Friends and family said this week that Zoia Ungureanu left her husband three 
months ago after eight years of an often turbulent marriage. Lorel Ungureanu 
often threatened his wife and verbally abused her, they said, keeping her from 
her first love, singing, out of jealousy. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, after Lorel Ungureanu's business went sour, his wife was forced to 
support the family as a cosmetologist. 
</P>
<P>
 After the couple separated, Lorel Ungureanu's life appeared to be falling 
apart, friends and family said. He was facing hard times financially, had been 
sued by his former business partner and was distraught over the prospect of 
losing his wife, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were so many problems around him," said Sebastian Pereanu, a longtime 
friend who emigrated to the United States with Lorel Ungureanu 20 years ago. 
"The last time I spoke to him, he was very depressed." 
</P>
<P>
 News of the shootings quickly spread throughout Southern California's Romanian 
immigrants, many of whom live in Los Angeles. Zoia Ungureanu's parents in 
Chicago received hundreds of telephone calls from friends and admirers they had 
never met, Margo Campeanu said. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are very, very upset, believe me," said Michael Istrate, owner of 
Mignon, the oldest Romanian restaurant in Los Angeles and a regular gathering 
place for expatriate Romanians. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple, who met at a beauty trade show in Chicago in 1986, were married 
that year at Istrate's restaurant before more than 150 guests. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was just the happiest day," Istrate recalled. "The restaurant was full of 
people and Zoia sang for everyone. Everything was beautiful." 
</P>
<P>
 At that time, Lorel Ungureanu was a successful businessman and a partner in 
Venice Trading Co. Inc., which manufactured furniture and equipment used in 
beauty salons. 
</P>
<P>
 But he and his partner in the company, Claudio Bonazza, had a bitter business 
dispute in 1989 which resulted in Lorel Ungureanu selling his 50% interest in 
the company to Bonazza, according to court records. 
</P>
<P>
 "He had been very rich. . . . But he went from having several Mercedes and 
houses to nothing," Buhoiu said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time of their deaths, Lorel and Zoia Ungureanu were being sued by 
Bonazza for allegedly producing and marketing equipment that was "confusingly 
similar" to Bonazza's products, the lawsuit claims. 
</P>
<P>
 Bonazza declined to discuss his former business partner or the lawsuit, which 
is pending in Orange County Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
 By all accounts, Zoia Ungureanu had tried to remain on friendly terms with her 
husband after their November separation. She spent Christmas and New Year's Eve 
with him and his two young sons from a previous marriage. Zoia Ungureanu had 
helped raise the boys, ages 13 and 14, who are now living with their mother. 
</P>
<P>
 "My aunt's biggest mistake was that she kept in touch when she left," Margo 
Campeanu said. "I think she was so scared that she wanted to be polite and 
diplomatic and tried to end things in a nice way. But he was so miserable and 
realized she wasn't coming back. He was penniless and had lost everything." 
</P>
<P>
 At the time of her death, Zoia Ungureanu was employed by Shiseido Cosmetics as 
a makeup artist at Nordstrom's in the Brea Mall, Browning said. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was afraid that something would happen," Browning said. "She would come 
to work and tell me that she was scared. That night, she sounded depressed and 
I told her that I was taking her to dinner. When I arrived to pick her up, she 
looked absolutely beautiful, as always. I compared her to Ivana Trump." 
</P>
<P>
 Browning said that as the pair walked to her car shortly after 8 p.m., Lorel 
Ungureanu drove up to the condominium complex in the 800 block of Springwood 
Street. After the shooting, as Zoia Ungureanu lay on the asphalt of the 
complex's parking lot, Browning said she drove away in panic to call police. 
She said she did not see Lorel Ungureanu shoot himself. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple were married two years after Ungureanu divorced his first wife, 
Linda Jean Cox, the mother of his two sons. Cox, too, had contended that Lorel 
Ungureanu was abusive. In court papers Cox filed at the time of the couple's 
separation, she claimed he beat, pushed and kicked her in the presence of their 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 Ungureanu has "a very violent and uncontrollable temper. He flares up at the 
slightest incident and goes crazy with rage," Cox declared in court records. 
She claimed Ungureanu vowed to kill her if she ever complained to police or 
anyone else. 
</P>
<P>
 But the courts and Orange police have no record of Zoia Ungureanu taking legal 
action to keep her husband away from her. Police "had no indication that she 
was fearful of him or that there was any domestic violence prior (to the 
shooting)," said Lt. Timm Browne. "There wasn't anything that would lead us to 
believe that this would be the outcome."

IN SURPRISE MOVE, HAYDEN ENTERS RACE FOR GOVERNOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL STALL and MARK GLADSTONE, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 State Sen. Tom Hayden, onetime leader of anti-war student radicals and 
longtime challenger of the Establishment, rattled the political cage again 
Wednesday by entering the June 7 Democratic primary for governor of California 
as "a messenger" of political reform. 
</P>
<P>
 Hayden, 54, of Santa Monica, said he is not under any illusion about winning 
election as governor, but said he would use his candidacy as a platform for 
forcing a solution to "the obstinate problem of power and money" that he said 
dominates California politics and the actions of elected officials in 
Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have become dangerously lost, I think, in the values of Babylon," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hayden said he would withdraw from the race before the final filing deadline 
of March 11 if the other Democratic candidates, Treasurer Kathleen Brown and 
Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi, embrace his political reform agenda with 
sufficient zeal. There was no sign Wednesday that they were willing to do that. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if he cannot realistically win, "victory has many meanings," Hayden said 
at a hastily called news conference -- opened with a prayer -- at the 
Sportsmens Lodge in Studio City. "It is victory to me when a single voice 
breaks the moral suffocation and political silence of one's time." 
</P>
<P>
 Hayden's decision came as a total surprise to the California political 
Establishment. Hayden said he had considered the idea for some time, but did 
not decide to file for office until late Tuesday night. The deadline for taking 
out candidacy papers for governor was Wednesday at 5 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 There was no consensus among political experts on the impact of Hayden's 
surprise candidacy on the contest, which all had assumed had settled down to 
three candidates: Brown and Garamendi in the Democratic primary and Gov. Pete 
Wilson running with no substantial opposition for the GOP nomination. 
</P>
<P>
 Some observers thought the Hayden ploy would hurt Brown, and some Garamendi. 
Others weren't sure. The only agreement was that the Wilson camp should be 
happy with the added turmoil among the Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think it's a fine idea," said Dan Schnur, Wilson's reelection campaign 
spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 Mervin Field, founder of the Field Poll and California's senior political 
analyst, said there is no question that Hayden's entry is "a major temblor" in 
the Democratic race. 
</P>
<P>
 Field pointed out that Hayden, while considered by many to be a political 
gadfly who often is discounted because of his earlier radical student and 
anti-war politics, is one of California's best known politicians and a proven 
vote-getter. 
</P>
<P>
 In a 1990 Field Poll, Hayden had 73% name identification, even though negative 
impressions of Hayden also registered relatively high at 31%, compared to a 
favorable rating of 42%. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1976, before he was elected to the Legislature, Hayden challenged 
first-term Sen. John V. Tunney in the Democratic primary and collected 1.2 
million votes, nearly 37% of the Democratic vote cast. Tunney won the primary, 
but lost to Republican S. I. Hayakawa in November. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1976 campaign was helped by an infusion of money from Hayden's then-wife, 
actress Jane Fonda. In 1992, after his divorce from Fonda, Hayden spent about 
$750,000 in winning a bitterly contested three-way Democratic primary for the 
state Senate seat he now holds. 
</P>
<P>
 Hayden's program, outlined on a one-page sheet entitled "Reforming the Special 
Interest State," includes campaign finance reform, reform of the Sacramento 
lobbying system and new ethics restrictions on officeholders and their 
appointees. 
</P>
<P>
 His program resembles Proposition 68, a ballot initiative that won a majority 
of votes in 1988 but was thrown out by court decisions. This time, Hayden would 
go further in limiting campaign contributions, have partial public financing of 
campaigns, prohibit off-year campaign fund-raising, outlaw political action 
committees and limit spending on legislative and gubernatorial campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
 Hayden also proposed a code of ethics for political consultants, greater 
public scrutiny of contributors, an end to tax deductions for lobbying 
expenses, a ban on lobbyists soliciting campaign contributions for 
officeholders they lobby, and a ban on the appointment of major campaign 
contributors to state boards such as the UC Board of Regents. 
</P>
<P>
 In effect, Hayden set down conditions for Brown and Garamendi to meet if 
Hayden is to step aside and let them resume their face-to-face contest for the 
Democratic nomination. Endorsement of the specific ideas is not enough, he 
said. They must "speak out on this general agenda to build public support 
during the campaign." 
</P>
<P>
 Further, whoever is elected governor must agree to meet with legislative 
leaders in January, 1995, to formulate a reform package, Hayden said. If 
agreement cannot be reached, the governor should commit to support a reform 
initiative on the 1996 election ballot, Hayden said. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Brown nor Garamendi jumped into acceptance, although Garamendi issued 
a statement in which he agreed on the need for reform and said, "I welcome a 
discussion of the issues raised by Tom Hayden." 
</P>
<P>
 But Garamendi added that "what we need most is leadership" on critical issues 
such as jobs, education reform and public safety. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am running for governor to make California work, and that includes 
political reform," Garamendi said. 
</P>
<P>
 As Hayden spoke, Brown was on the second day of her formal announcement tour 
of the state. Asked about Hayden by reporters, she would talk only about the 
issues she has been discussing, declining even to mention him by name. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown campaign spokesman Michael Reese issued this statement: "To build a new 
California, we need to create jobs, break the cycle of violence and reform our 
schools. Kathleen Brown is still the only candidate who has a plan to do that 
and these are the issues she's going to keep talking about no matter who else 
joins the race." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson aide Schnur said "there's no question" that Hayden's presence hurts 
Brown more than Garamendi. "Kathleen Brown is the front-runner and 
front-runners like very safe and predictable primaries," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Conservative GOP strategist Ken Khachigian said, however, "That great sucking 
sound is John Garamendi going down the tubes." 
</P>
<P>
 "Hayden's going to make a pitch for the same blue-collar constituency that 
Garamendi will, a sort of populist kind of approach," Khachigian said. 
</P>
<P>
 Khachigian also said Hayden and Garamendi would tend to split the male 
Democratic vote, allowing Brown to reap dividends from the majority of women 
who tend to vote in Democratic primaries. 
</P>
<P>
 Pollster Field thought it impossible to assess the impact at this point. He 
offered two contrasting scenarios. In one, Hayden's views might appeal to 
Democratic women and thus detract from Brown's possible gender advantage. 
</P>
<P>
 In the other, the star quality of both Hayden and Brown might put Garamendi 
more in the shadow, Field said. 
</P>
<P>
 In any event, both Democrats will find Hayden a strong competitor for 
attention from a voting public that often gives only limited attention to 
political affairs, particularly in the months preceding the voting. 
</P>
<P>
 Field noted that Hayden presumably would have to be included in any Democratic 
candidate debates, the forum in which Garamendi has been hoping to score a 
major breakthrough against Brown because of his greater experience in 
government and ability to discuss almost any subject in state government in 
detail without preparation.

 State Sen. Tom Hayden (D-Santa Monica) declared his candidacy for governor of 
California. If he stays in the race, he will compete against Treasurer Kathleen 
Brown and Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi for the Democratic nomination 
in the June 7 primary. The winner will run in the fall against Republican Pete 
Wilson, who is seeking a second term.

RUSSIANS WARN WEST AGAINST BOSNIA STRIKES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SONNI EFRON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With rare unanimity, Russian lawmakers across the political spectrum united 
behind President Boris N. Yeltsin on Wednesday in warning that a NATO air 
strike in Bosnia would seriously damage Western relations with Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 Ultranationalist leader Vladimir V. Zhirinovsky delivered a near-hysterical 
speech to Parliament, warning that "a bombing strike on Bosnia is a declaration 
of war on Russia; it is the beginning of World War III." Even devout liberals, 
including former First Deputy Prime Minister Yegor T. Gaidar and other 
prominent westernizers, warned that military action against the Serbs would be 
seen here as U.S.-sponsored aggression. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be a disaster for Russian-American relations," said Vyacheslav 
Nikonov, who once taught Russian politics at Caltech and now chairs the 
security and arms control subcommittee in the Duma, or lower house of 
Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
 "After you start bombing Yugoslavia, we'll never ratify the START II treaty, 
never," Nikonov said. "The treaty is in big trouble anyway, but that would 
destroy its chances." 
</P>
<P>
 Yeltsin was sick with a cold Wednesday and was working from his countryside 
dacha , but a spokesman said the president was "in continuous contact" with 
world leaders and had been urging them not to bomb Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
</P>
<P>
 Foreign Minister Andrei V. Kozyrev, in a letter to U.N. Secretary General 
Boutros Boutros-Ghali, reiterated Russia's opposition to the use of force. 
Kozyrev said Russia believes that only the secretary general, in consultation 
with the U.N. Security Council, has the right to order bombing, the Interfax 
news agency reported. 
</P>
<P>
 Underlining that position, Gaidar said Russia "must firmly speak against 
bombardment of Bosnian Serb positions in the U.N. and its Security Council." 
The young economist said Russia might veto a Security Council resolution 
authorizing bombardment. 
</P>
<P>
 There was no immediate government reaction Wednesday evening to the NATO 
ultimatum ordering that all heavy artillery be moved 13 miles outside Sarajevo 
within seven to 10 days. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier in the day, Interfax, quoting unnamed Foreign Ministry sources, 
reported that Deputy Foreign Minister Vitaly Churkin will present a Russian 
plan to demilitarize Sarajevo at talks in Geneva today. 
</P>
<P>
 The president's spokesman described that proposal as "very sensitive" and 
declined to provide details. 
</P>
<P>
 Russia has historically supported Bosnia's Serbs, who are brother Slavs and 
Orthodox Christians. Russian Slavophiles have gone to the former Yugoslav 
federation to fight on the Serbs' side. 
</P>
<P>
 Many Russians believe the Serbs have suffered in the conflict as much as 
Muslims and Croats, and most reject Western suggestions that the Serbs have 
largely been the aggressors. 
</P>
<P>
 These sympathies have been reinforced by the Russian media. Though diplomatic 
developments receive constant coverage, Russian television over the past year 
has shown comparatively little daily footage of the Bosnian carnage that has so 
horrified Western viewers. 
</P>
<P>
 However, graphic footage of Sunday's massacre in the Sarajevo marketplace has 
been repeatedly aired in recent days. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our television does not show this very often," said Irina M. Khakamada, a 
lawmaker from the December 12th Union, a liberal Duma faction that has not 
taken a position on Bosnia. "In fact, we are not that well informed." 
</P>
<P>
 The faction led by economist Grigory Yavlinsky issued a statement Wednesday 
warning that North Atlantic Treaty Organization involvement "in an armed 
conflict beyond NATO's sphere may break the military-political balance in 
Europe and contradict Russia's national interests." 
</P>
<P>
 The statement also warned that lifting the arms embargo against Bosnia would 
draw Muslim nations into the conflict. 
</P>
<P>
 Democratic lawmakers especially fear that Russian nationalism and mistrust of 
the West will be intensified and Yeltsin's position weakened if NATO is 
perceived to be bullying the Serbs. 
</P>
<P>
 "This will be a great gift to Zhirinovsky, the Agrarians and the Communists," 
said Andranik Migranyan, a longtime Yeltsin adviser.

CLINTON DRUG PLAN BOOSTS EMPHASIS ON TREATMENT; NARCOTICS: THE $13.2-BILLION 
STRATEGY WOULD CUT INTERDICTION AT THE BORDER AND INCREASE EFFORTS ABROAD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL RICHTER and RAY DELGADO, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Calling it "a course that offers the promise of real results," President 
Clinton on Wednesday formally presented a $13.2-billion drug-fighting strategy 
that partly shifts emphasis from law enforcement to drug treatment and 
prevention. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton, appearing with inmates undergoing drug treatment at a Washington-area 
prison, outlined a plan that would increase overall anti-drug spending by $1 
billion, or 8.6%, while boosting spending on treatment and prevention by $827 
million, or 18.2%, to $5.4 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 The program pares efforts to halt the cross-border and seaborne flow of drugs, 
which the Administration considers "cost-ineffective," by $94 million, or 7.3%, 
to $1.2 billion. But it will increase spending to counter the manufacture of 
drugs abroad. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the shift in emphasis, the Administration would still spend 59% of its 
anti-drug budget for law enforcement, and 41% for treatment and prevention. 
</P>
<P>
 The total spending, which would mark a 9% increase from last year, assumes 
that Congress will accept the Senate's version of the pending crime bill, an 
assumption that may not prove true. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking at the Prince George's County Correctional Facility, Clinton said he 
knows firsthand that treatment of drug abuse works. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have the questionable privilege of living in a family that has dealt with 
both alcoholism and drug treatment," he said. Clinton's half-brother, Roger, 
was jailed for drug use, and his mother was once married to an alcoholic. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton budget would allow the treatment of an additional 140,000 addicts. 
Federal authorities estimate the total addict population at 2.5 million, but 
only 1.1 million of those who potentially could benefit from treatment are 
receiving it. 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Reuter, a drug expert at the University of Maryland who has advised the 
federal government, said that even with more spending, U.S. anti-drug treatment 
programs probably cannot absorb more addicts. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't force-feed it," he said. "The drug treatment infrastructure is very 
weak." 
</P>
<P>
 Typically, only 20% of addicts who participate in drug treatment programs are 
still off drugs a year later, Reuter said. but the rate improves after users 
have been through such programs several times. "After four or five drug 
treatment (programs), you start to see some greater effects," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed program would spend $191 million more to reduce drug use among 
students, including stepped-up education campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
 The largest single area of increased spending would be prevention and 
community anti-drug programs. Spending would increase by $448 million, or 28%. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said they decided to cut drug-interdiction funding in part because 
traffickers have changed their tactics in response to policing. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) hailed that decision, saying it is "very 
smart" to conduct fewer surveillance flights and to focus instead on 
"overturning the drug-producing gangs and cartels in the countries that grow 
the drugs." 
</P>
<P>
 But the Administration program was denounced by Sen. Phil Gramm (R-Tex.), who 
called it a "welcome mat for drug thugs." 
</P>
<P>
 Treatment "does have a proper place in the mix of anti-drug programs but not 
at the expense of law enforcement," Gramm said. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton was accused last year of downplaying anti-drug efforts after he cut 
140 jobs and 23 employees from the Office of National Drug Control Policy. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the downsizing of the White House drug office, and signs that drug use 
is again on the rise, political pressure for more federal action to fight drugs 
has subsided from the levels of the late 1980s, when the crack cocaine epidemic 
began. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's remarks were made in the prison gymnasium in front of about 75 
inmates who are undergoing treatment in a program called Awakening. 
</P>
<P>
 One of them, 43-year-old Joseph Mungo, said his attraction to drugs "was more 
powerful than I knew." 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to spend the rest of my life in jail," he said as Clinton 
listened intently. "I have lost everything and I have to start over." 
</P>
<P>
 Reactions from the crowd to Clinton's presentation were positive.

 "I see the changes in people who are coming through this program," said Jeff 
Blackwell, 32, of Washington. "Any type of program for drug addiction is more 
positive than warehousing." 
</P>
<P>
 "We're addicts," said 46-year-old Donzel Moorehead of Washington, who has been 
in the Awakenings program for nine weeks and has three weeks to go. "We go 
overboard in everything we do. Treatment is necessary because it helps us 
change our attitudes about the disease."

OFFICERS HELD IN GUNFIRE, WILD CHASE

 Two off-duty Los Angeles police officers were arrested Wednesday in the South 
Bay after they apparently went on a drunken shooting spree, firing from the 
open windows of their pickup truck on the terrified passengers of a moving bus 
and on a California Highway patrolman, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Identified as Officers Michael Herrera, 30, and Ted Teyechea, 29, the off-duty 
patrolmen were booked on suspicion of assault with a deadly weapon on a peace 
officer and were being held on $25,000 bail each, said Deputy Rich Erickson of 
the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
 No one was injured in the incident, but the investigation forced closure of 
two Harbor Freeway transition roads, tying up traffic during most of the 
evening rush-hour. 
</P>
<P>
 The gunplay erupted about 2 p.m. near the 190th Street on-ramp to the 
northbound Harbor Freeway, in a narrow strip of Los Angeles that separates the 
cities of Carson and Gardena. As a CHP motorcycle officer was wrapping up an 
unrelated traffic stop on an on-ramp, a Metropolitan Transit Authority bus 
roared by, its occupants shrieking out the windows that someone was shooting at 
them, Erickson said. 
</P>
<P>
 As the patrolman strained to hear their words, Erickson said, a beige pickup 
truck careened by with two guns blazing from the windows, "and both occupants 
of the truck fired at the motor officer." 
</P>
<P>
 Unscathed, the officer took off after the truck, whose occupants were still 
shooting, chasing it north on the Harbor Freeway and then west on the Artesia 
Freeway, Erickson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, the truck became caught in a traffic jam and the CHP officer, 
accompanied by backup units, was able to pull over the two men and take them 
into custody, Erickson said. Authorities would not immediately release the name 
of the motorcycle officer who gave chase. 
</P>
<P>
 Two handguns and a number of expended casings were recovered in the truck, but 
it was unclear whether they were from service weapons, Erickson said. Officials 
added that the officers apparently were drunk. 
</P>
<P>
 "At least nine rounds were fired, and there was an indication that both 
officers had been drinking," said Sheriff's Lt. Raymond Peavy. "The bottom line 
in this case is that a couple of officers probably won't be officers any 
longer, and they're looking at serious criminal charges." 
</P>
<P>
 The two officers were described as experienced patrolmen from the LAPD's 77th 
Street Division, where fellow officers reacted with shock. Herrera has been 
with the department for since November, 1984, and Teyechea has been an LAPD 
officer since July, 1985, according to department records. 
</P>
<P>
 Both, authorities said, were assigned to the division's morning watch, which 
goes off duty before 8 a.m. It was unclear whether they had been working the 
morning preceding the incident. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is really mind-boggling," said Sgt. Mike Perez, the 77th Street watch 
commander. "I can't believe it. These guys are not youngsters." 
</P>
<P>
 LAPD spokesmen added that the department would have no formal comment on the 
incident, pending the investigation by the Sheriff's Department, to which the 
incident was passed at the request of the CHP. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, MTA police said they are conducting their own probe of the 
shooting.

COLUMN ONE; NORWAY'S RETURN TO THE PEAK; PROUD OF THEIR WINTER SPORTS HERITAGE, 
NORWEGIANS DOMINATED DECADES OF OLYMPIC GAMES. AFTER AN EMBARRASSING SLUMP, THE 
REVITALIZED NATIONAL TEAM IS PRIMED TO ICE THE COMPETITION AGAIN.

<P>
 To stunned Norwegians, the humbling events of the 1988 Winter Olympics were as 
hard to imagine as having to stand on a table in a crowded cafe and sing the 
Swedish national anthem. 
</P>
<P>
 It was bad enough that they had to listen to the Swedish anthem four times 
from Calgary, while their athletes -- for the first time since the Winter Games 
began in 1924 -- won zero gold medals. 
</P>
<P>
 While the tabloid headlines screamed "disaster," the more thoughtful 
newspapers pondered whether elite sports were still as important in a modern, 
egalitarian society as they were in the days when Norway's winter athletes were 
kicking the rest of the world's collective behind. 
</P>
<P>
 It seems the country's sports leaders, with encouragement from the government, 
concluded the answer to that question was "yes." 
</P>
<P>
 Six years ago, they established a program called Olympiatoppen to improve 
Norway's standing in world sports. Olympiatoppen (loosely, "striving to reach 
the Olympic summit") created the financial backing and centralized training 
system needed to make a national sports program successful. 
</P>
<P>
 When the program's director, Thor Ole Rimejorde, a career military officer, 
reviewed the results from Calgary, he saw no gold medals. But he did see a 
golden future. 
</P>
<P>
 "We won only five medals in 1988, but we had many young athletes in places 
four through 10," Rimejorde said recently in an interview in his Oslo office. 
"I knew we were about to move ahead of other countries." 
</P>
<P>
 Rimejorde needs only three seconds to name one of those countries -- Sweden, 
whose relationship with Norway is the geopolitical equivalent of a sibling 
rivalry. Swedes sometimes even refer to their Scandinavian neighbors as "little 
brothers," which Norwegians do not find especially endearing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was very pleased I was not responsible for Swedish sport because their four 
gold medals were largely the work of two men," Rimejorde said. "What has 
happened since is exactly as I forecast in '88. We are the success; the Swedes 
are the fiasco." 
</P>
<P>
 Norway's slide from Olympic prominence started in 1968 but hit bottom in 
goldless '88. 
</P>
<P>
 Not even Rimejorde expected success to be so clear so soon. During the 1992 
Winter Olympics in the French Alps, Norwegians won 20 medals, nine of them 
gold, to finish third behind Germany and the since-disbanded Unified Team of 
former Soviet republics. 
</P>
<P>
 And now, with the Olympics coming to Lillehammer, which, town leaders 
frequently remind visitors, edged out a Swedish candidate for the right to 
stage the Games, Norway could top the medal standings for the sixth time -- the 
first such coup since 1968. 
</P>
<P>
 How are characteristically reserved Norwegians handling the anticipation of an 
avalanche of gold? 
</P>
<P>
 Like backslapping, yahooing Dallas Cowboy fans. Forty-eight hours before 
Saturday's opening ceremony at Lillehammer Olympic Park, they are arriving here 
by the trainload, sporting Viking helmets, Norwegian flags painted on their 
faces, clanging cowbells and flasks of the national bellywarmer, a potent tonic 
called aquavit. 
</P>
<P>
 Norway's rediscovered athletic prowess has bred a new concern. "We have to be 
nice to the world and let them win some gold medals or they will have not such 
a good time," said Gerhard Heiberg, an Oslo industrialist who serves as 
president of the Lillehammer Olympic Organizing Committee. "The people of sport 
in Norway say I should shut up." 
</P>
<P>
 Those people of sport acknowledge that their team's resurgence in part arises 
from the dismantling of the ultra-efficient, state-supported medal machines in 
the former Soviet Union and East Germany. But they also give themselves credit 
for forming Olympiatoppen after disappointing results in the 1984 Winter and 
Summer Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
 They add, however, that the goal was not just to climb in the medal standings 
but to combat a national malaise borne of the oil boom in the late 1970s and 
early '80s that enriched many Norwegians financially, putting two cars in every 
garage, televisions in every bedroom and potatoes on every couch. 
</P>
<P>
 Norwegians fancy themselves rugged outdoorsmen, the snowier and colder it is 
the better. They argue with the Swedes over whose country should be known as 
"the cradle of skiing" and like to say that their babies are born with skis on. 
</P>
<P>
 After winning three gold medals in cross-country skiing in 1992, Vegard 
Ulvang, 30, said: "I am always amused to read in the foreign press how a 
Russian or Italian athlete can recall the precise day he was given his first 
pair of skis. We in Norway can never remember this because we are too young 
when it happens." 
</P>
<P>
 But in recent years, teen-agers have forsaken their skis for MTV and video 
games. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can remember when skiing was a mode of transportation, then our most 
popular recreation after it became so easy to travel by car and bus," Rimejorde 
said. "Our concern was that it someday would become only a spectator sport and 
we would become a lazy people." 
</P>
<P>
 One aim of Olympiatoppen, he said, was to create new ski heroes, whom the 
program's leaders hoped would become role models for the nation's youth. 
</P>
<P>
 The government shot even higher, hoping that the success of the skiers would 
serve as an inspiration to the entire country. Star athletes can serve as 
models of "team spirit and cooperation," Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland 
said during the 1992 Winter Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
 "We must learn from our sports heroes because we are going to need more of 
their initiative and perseverance," she said. "Excellence must become typically 
Norwegian both inside and outside sports stadiums." 
</P>
<P>
 Her message, however, was intended not only for Norwegians but also for the 12 
nations of the European Community. Although Norway is divided over whether to 
become a member, Brundtland wants desperately for the country to be wanted. 
</P>
<P>
 John Hoberman, a professor at the University of Texas at Austin who has 
written extensively about the Olympic movement, criticized her in a syndicated 
column for exploiting sports for political purposes. 
</P>
<P>
 "She played the Olympic card very cleverly," he wrote. "Her message was that 
Norwegian businessmen could play with the big boys in the economic major 
leagues, that sheer self-confidence could accomplish wonders." 
</P>
<P>
 Norway's sports leaders know that the secret of their success is not that 
simple. 
</P>
<P>
 Tradition, of course, was part of the mix, particularly in sports such as 
cross-country skiing, ski jumping and speed skating that provided most of 
Norway's medals when it topped the medal standings in five of six Winter Games 
between 1924 and 1952. (Except for speed skating, most of those sports 
originated in Scandinavia.) 
</P>
<P>
 Passionate about cross-country skiing, Norwegians ordered so many tickets for 
this year's events that the 31,000-seat Birkebeiner Stadium could have sold out 
six times over. Of the unlucky losers in the ticket lottery, up to 40,000 are 
expected to line the course each day. 
</P>
<P>
 Ulvang is Norway's most popular athlete, and not just because he won three 
gold medals in '92. He personifies the image many Norwegians have of themselves 
as a people, an explorer-adventurer who has hiked across Mongolia, canoed 
across Siberia, skied through Greenland and climbed the highest peaks on five 
continents. 
</P>
<P>
 While Americans have been following the daily saga of figure skaters Nancy 
Kerrigan and Tonya Harding, Norwegians have been transfixed by Ulvang's lonely 
treks into the wilderness in an attempt to find his brother, who disappeared 
during a snowstorm last October. 
</P>
<P>
 On almost as many magazine covers, however, are the alpine -- or downhill -- 
skiers, whose discipline until recently was so little respected in Norway that 
their results were not even listed in the sports pages under skiing. They were 
listed under alpine, which as far as most Norwegians were concerned, had more 
to do with sipping hot wine in front of a fireplace in France or Switzerland 
than actually skiing. 
</P>
<P>
 But Olympiatoppen embraced alpine skiing because it attracted the Nintendo 
generation, which was enthralled by the speed and danger. In the 1992 Olympics, 
Norway won four alpine medals, including its first since 1952. 
</P>
<P>
 The Norwegian Olympic Committee's annual spending budget of $7.2 million, much 
of it contributed by corporations and the remainder by the government, has 
increased by almost 250% in the last six years. But officials said that how 
much money is spent is less important than how it is spent. 
</P>
<P>
 "Knowing we are a small nation with only 4.3 million people, it's not wise to 
spend our resources on many sports," said Arne Myhrvold, president of Norway's 
Olympic Committee. "We have to concentrate on a few people in a few sports. 
</P>
<P>
 "This has led to discussions, for instance, with the athletics (track and 
field) federation, which wants to back all disciplines. We say: 'It would be a 
waste of money to spend it on the 100 meters. The Africans and Americans have 
too much talent for us.' But if you are an individual in long-distance running, 
we are willing to help you." 
</P>
<P>
 Norway's love for the winter sports is so great that its Olympic committee 
spends half of its budget on five winter sports and the other half on 39 summer 
sports. 
</P>
<P>
 Those in the favored sports are encouraged to trade information with each 
other. And athletes are expected to participate in numerous pursuits outside 
their primary sports -- including rock climbing, parachute jumping, karate and 
ballet -- in order to have a well-rounded training base. It's Norway's version 
of cross-training. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are considering bungee jumping," said Ola K. Bakke, head of the alpine 
skiing federation. 
</P>
<P>
 As a mental exercise, one of Norway's leading violinists, Arve Tellefsen, 
meets with athletes to share his method of collecting himself after a 
disappointing concert. 
</P>
<P>
 Myhrvold said Olympiatoppen has achieved so much so soon that the Japanese 
want to use it as a model for their athletes leading to the 1998 Winter 
Olympics in Nagano. 
</P>
<P>
 Infinitely more satisfying for the Norwegians: Even the Swedes -- who won only 
one gold medal in 1992 -- have copied some of their training methods. Medal 
Madness 
</P>
<P>
 Norway's Olympic team won no gold medals in 1988, triggering that has had 
striking results.

NATO TELLS BOSNIAN SERBS TO PULL BACK ARMS OR FACE STRIKES; BALKANS: THE REBELS 
SURROUNDING SARAJEVO ARE OFFERED ALTERNATIVE OF PUTTING HEAVY WEAPONS UNDER 
U.N. CONTROL. THEIR COMMANDERS, ANTICIPATING THE ULTIMATUM, AGREE TO A 
CEASE-FIRE.

<P>
 The United States and its West European allies Wednesday issued a 10-day 
ultimatum to Bosnian Serb forces, warning that they face air bombardment unless 
they withdraw their heavy weapons from the hills surrounding Sarajevo or place 
the arms under U.N. control. 
</P>
<P>
 Anticipating the ultimatum, Bosnian Serb commanders in Sarajevo agreed earlier 
in the day to a cease-fire and said they were prepared to give the United 
Nations control over their artillery. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday's decision on air strikes, made here by the ambassadors of the 16 
North Atlantic Treaty Organization countries, effectively brings the Western 
powers to the brink of offensive military action in the Balkans for the first 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will use our air power to stop the terrible loss of life and suffering 
down there," NATO Secretary General Manfred Woerner told a news conference 
after the meeting. "We have to stop the killing." 
</P>
<P>
 The decision called for Bosnian Serb forces either to withdraw or to place 
under U.N. control all heavy weapons within 20 kilometers (12.6 miles) of 
central Sarajevo. An area around the nearby town of Pale, where the Bosnian 
Serbs have their headquarters, was exempted from the zone. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials say the NATO plan asks -- but does not order -- the Bosnian 
government to put its heavy weapons, estimated to number fewer than 10, under 
U.N. command as well. They estimate that the Bosnian Serbs have at least 100 
heavy weapons. The NATO demands come nearly two years after the start of the 
bitter war in Bosnia-Herzegovina, which has left 250,000 people dead or 
missing, and follow previous threats by Western democracies that achieved 
little. 
</P>
<P>
 But NATO is now poised to act, a senior U.S. official told reporters in 
Washington. "NATO is ready to act in Bosnia. We firmly hope it will not be 
necessary to do so." 
</P>
<P>
 The alliance set a deadline of 10 days from midnight tonight for completion of 
the withdrawal and specifically listed the weapons involved -- including tanks, 
artillery pieces, mortars, multiple-rocket launchers and antiaircraft weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 "Heavy weapons of any kind . . . found within the Sarajevo exclusion zone, 
unless controlled by (the United Nations) will, along with their direct and 
essential military support facilities, be subject to NATO air strikes," the 
ultimatum stated. 
</P>
<P>
 The 10-day delay, the U.S. official said, is to allow U.N. peacekeeping units 
to take protective measures. 
</P>
<P>
 The declaration noted that any such military action would be conducted "in 
close coordination with" U.N. Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali. 
</P>
<P>
 The alliance on Wednesday also accepted Boutros-Ghali's request to use NATO 
forces for air strikes in a second instance: against any artillery or mortar 
positions in or around Sarajevo that fire on civilian targets. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday's decision stems directly from the groundswell of public outrage 
that reverberated throughout the West after the massacre of 68 people last 
Saturday when a mortar round exploded in a crowded outdoor market in Sarajevo. 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter written the day after the Sarajevo massacre, Boutros-Ghali 
specifically sought permission to order NATO planes into action under such 
circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
 Woerner said that Boutros-Ghali's approval would be required prior to any 
punitive air strikes and that NATO would act "in close coordination with the 
(U.N.) secretary general" in assessing the need to follow through on the 
ultimatum. About 100 NATO aircraft, mainly stationed in Italy, plus other 
planes stationed aboard British, French and U.S. aircraft carriers operating in 
the Adriatic, would be available if the strikes are necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 Even with the force of public opinion suddenly mobilized behind them, the 
ultimatum did not come easily to alliance members. 
</P>
<P>
 NATO ambassadors met here in a marathon 12-hour session before overcoming the 
final concerns of some member states -- notably Greece and Canada. 
</P>
<P>
 Canada, one of several NATO countries that have ground forces in Bosnia as 
part of the 12,000-strong U.N. peacekeeping force, reportedly expressed concern 
that air strikes might trigger Serbian reprisals against its troops. The 
Canadian soldiers are particularly exposed in Srebrenica in eastern Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
 Greece, the lone Balkan member of NATO and the only member with strong 
sympathies toward the Serbs, said it would not participate in any air 
operations around Sarajevo and would not permit NATO aircraft to launch strikes 
from bases in Greece. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are against any Balkan people being involved in this," Greek Deputy 
Foreign Minister Georg Papandreou told the Cable News Network on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 There was also concern about the political and military risks involved in air 
strikes. 
</P>
<P>
 Slow-moving antitank aircraft would be potential targets for Bosnian Serbs' 
surface-to-air missiles, and opinion is sharply divided on whether NATO 
involvement would curtail the violence or escalate it. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday's decision to issue the ultimatum was also complicated by a strongly 
negative reaction by Russia, a Serbian ally. Moscow has demanded a meeting of 
the U.N. Security Council to discuss the prospect of air strikes. 
</P>
<P>
 As reports leaked out of the NATO meeting Wednesday afternoon that the 
alliance was moving toward agreement on the air strikes, Bosnian Serb and 
Muslim military commanders struck a cease-fire deal that included a promise to 
put heavy artillery on the mountains ringing Sarajevo under U.N. control. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.N. would monitor the heavy weapons and deploy troops to sensitive areas 
under the plan brokered by the U.N. commander in Bosnia, British Lt. Gen. 
Michael Rose. 
</P>
<P>
 But critical details, such as which locations would be covered under the 
agreement, remained undecided. Rose cautioned reporters not to make too much of 
the deal. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither of the warring parties signed a plan, and no document outlining the 
agreement was produced. But a summary of the cease-fire agreement provided to 
reporters indicated that Bosnian Serb army Gen. Manojlo Milovanovic and Gen. 
Jovan Divjak of the Muslim-led Bosnian army agreed to a cease-fire beginning at 
noon today. 
</P>
<P>
 Deals like this have been brokered before, with military commanders 
negotiating bargains that political leaders later refused to implement.

ATTENDANCE DROP DISRUPTS L.A. SCHOOLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Thousands of students have formally checked out of Los Angeles schools, 
switched to other campuses or not yet showed up for classes after last month's 
earthquake, creating disruptive shifts in enrollment throughout the huge 
system. 
</P>
<P>
 The enrollment changes affect campuses across the Los Angeles Unified School 
District, even those outside the hardest-hit San Fernando Valley. Although some 
schools have lost record numbers of students, others have picked up enrollment 
as families move to new homes in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "Boy, talk about movement -- it's astounding," said Assistant Supt. Sally 
Coughlin, who oversees the 131 elementary schools in the Valley. "We knew there 
would be some movement but we didn't expect this." 
</P>
<P>
 The new attendance patterns could have far-reaching consequences for the 
640,000-student district, including the prospect of new budget cuts because of 
lost per-pupil funding from the state and widespread teacher transfers next 
fall. 
</P>
<P>
 In an effort to reverse the trend and raise attendance, the district has 
directed principals and attendance clerks to seek out students who have not 
showed up for school since the Jan. 17 earthquake or to at least find out why 
they are absent -- a technicality that could keep state funds flowing. 
</P>
<P>
 Principals and teachers have scoured parks and Red Cross shelters looking for 
wayward students and clerks have spent nights and weekends on the phone to 
track down children. Because of the large number of displaced families, 
however, clerks are having a difficult time locating students and their 
parents. 
</P>
<P>
 The numbers tell the story: 
</P>
<P>
 * At Canoga Park Elementary, about 75 pupils formally checked out after the 
earthquake and another 220 still have not been located. The school's enrollment 
dropped from 838 students before the quake to 543. 
</P>
<P>
 * At Limerick Avenue Elementary in Canoga Park, 54 students notified the 
office they were leaving, 41 have not been located, 13 recently enrolled from 
other district schools and another five pupils reported they were too afraid to 
return to the campus. The school's enrollment dropped from 902 before the quake 
to 815. 
</P>
<P>
 * At Hart Street Elementary in Canoga Park, 42 students checked out, 61 cannot 
be located, 12 recently enrolled and 16 have not returned because of fear and 
trauma from the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 * At Monroe High School in North Hills, 121 students checked out and another 
200 have not returned to school for unknown reasons. Enrollment dropped from 
2,350 students to 2,029. 
</P>
<P>
 * And at Fremont High School in South-Central Los Angeles, enrollment has 
picked up by 10 students who were attending El Camino Real High in Woodland 
Hills. That campus, badly damaged by the quake, still has not reopened. But the 
typical mid-semester enrollment surge at Fremont has failed to materialize, 
leaving the school with 2,585 students. 
</P>
<P>
 A survey of enrollment taken by the district this week at 71 Valley elementary 
schools showed that at least 1,756 students have formally withdrawn from 
school, at least 513 cannot be located and 186 pupils have said they are too 
traumatized to return. About 844 other students have switched campuses since 
the earthquake. The survey covered only half of Valley elementary schools and 
no secondary schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been here 16 years and I've never seen anything like this," said Fanny 
Italia, who oversees attendance at Patrick Henry Middle School in Granada 
Hills. "It's very unusual. Families are moving to South Dakota, Ventura, 
Florida, Mexico, Las Vegas, Philadelphia, Brazil, Texas and San Jose." 
</P>
<P>
 Attendance has plummeted even more dramatically in the district's adult 
schools, which offer classes in English as a second language, business skills 
and other subjects, mostly at night. Of the 400,000 students who were enrolled 
in adult school on Jan. 17, about 250,000 have not returned, prompting district 
officials to spend $30,000 in English and Spanish advertising to alert students 
that the schools are open. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's housing, it's jobs and it's post-traumatic stress," said Martin Conroy, 
principal at the Reseda Community Adult School, which has lost nearly 600 of 
its 2,500-student enrollment. "A tremendous number of people have lost housing 
and are too preoccupied to come back." 
</P>
<P>
 The enrollment drop in the regular day schools is considerably more severe 
than after the Sylmar quake in 1971, when the district lost 1,500 students, 
including 835 who could not be accounted for by school officials. Nine campuses 
in the Sylmar and San Fernando areas were the hardest hit then by the 
attendance declines. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, schools are working doggedly to find students, with some campus 
attendance clerks working full time to locate pupils. In some cases, the 
mystery is only cleared up when parents call from new homes in other cities or 
when school districts call from Florida and Texas, among other places, 
requesting student records. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles district is also sending buses to Red Cross shelters to gather 
up homeless students and take them to school. Of the 1,654 people who stayed in 
shelters on Tuesday, between 600 and 660 were children, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're casting a fishing net to try to get as many of these kids back as we 
can," said Thane Opfell, the assistant principal at Monroe. "I have people 
making phone calls and I've sent letters home telling parents that school is 
safe and open and they should send their children back." 
</P>
<P>
 At Limerick Elementary, attendance clerk Sonja Bowman worked last weekend 
calling parents and relatives, looking for students who had not returned. She 
located 40 pupils but could not persuade all of them to return. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't suffer structural or physical damage but our biggest concern is 
finding the kids -- getting them back and finding out where they've gone," said 
Ronni Ephraim, the principal at Limerick. "When you lose all these kids and get 
new kids, the whole dynamic of your school changes. It shakes up your life in a 
lot of other ways than just the physical shaking from the earthquake. It's 
taken a big toll." 
</P>
<P>
 The story is the same throughout the district. Principals say their campuses 
are in a state of upheaval -- many class sizes have shrunk, students are 
enrolling in new courses and teachers are fearful that the declining attendance 
could mean transfers and layoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 As Canoga Park Elementary, Principal Barbara Gutierrez said: "It's creating a 
certain mourning period for the teachers as they realize which kids we've lost. 
People are readjusting but I think it's been hard." 
</P>
<P>
 Some schools say that attendance is sporadic. Students show up one day and 
then don't return for a week while their families look for permanent homes. 
</P>
<P>
 "They come a day and then not for two days," said Christina P. Alayon-Young, a 
first-grade teacher at Justice Street Elementary in West Hills. "It's difficult 
but you try to keep them up with what they missed without stressing them out 
about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Some parents, particularly those in the shelters, say they are worried about 
sending their children back to school. "My little girl is afraid to go to 
school and to be separated," said Celia Valdez, a mother of five, who is 
staying at the Red Cross shelter at Fulton Middle School in Van Nuys. "She 
worries about it too much." 
</P>
<P>
 Valerie Muller, whose son attended Sherman Oaks Elementary, sent the 
first-grader to stay with her family in Germany. Muller, whose condominium was 
destroyed in the quake, said her son was too afraid to remain in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was really, really devastating to him," Muller said. "He says he will 
never, ever come back to California." 
</P>
<P>
 District officials say they are concerned about the large numbers of students 
too afraid to return to school. At Hazeltine Avenue Elementary in Van Nuys, for 
example, 22 students have not showed up for class because of earthquake trauma. 
</P>
<P>
 Coughlin, who oversees the elementary schools, said she will encourage 
principals to get crisis counselors to meet with those students. 
</P>
<P>
 The enrollment shifts lead to potential budgetary problems for the 
cash-strapped school system. The district, which closed all schools for five 
days after the earthquake, has received assurances the system will not lose 
state per-pupil funding for that time. 
</P>
<P>
 But the district probably will lose money because of the hundreds of students 
who have not yet returned to school and who cannot be accounted for. Schools 
are required to maintain a daily record of school attendance and receive $4,200 
per pupil a year. Unexcused absences, however, are not repaid by the state. 
</P>
<P>
 Although district and school officials expected some shifts in enrollment 
because of the quake, they say the changes are greater than initially 
anticipated, making planning difficult. A full report on enrollments won't be 
prepared for at least two months, said budget services director Henry Jones. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been a while since we had a normal year when we weren't dealing with 
riots, floods or earthquakes," Jones said. "We've had some kind of natural 
disaster for the last couple of years."

RETROFITTED BRIDGES WITHSTOOD EARTHQUAKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VIRGINIA ELLIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dozens of highway structures that were strengthened for earthquake safety rode 
out the Northridge temblor with only minor damage, proving that the state's 
seismic retrofitting program can prevent major bridge collapses, a Caltrans 
report said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 In their first detailed assessment of the damage sustained by highway 
overpasses and interchanges, Caltrans officials said the Northridge earthquake, 
unlike previous quakes, probably will not prompt major changes in retrofitting 
and design standards for bridges. 
</P>
<P>
 All the retrofitted bridges withstood major shaking, he said, with only minor 
damage. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't see any big surprises in this earthquake like we had in Loma Prieta. 
I think what it showed is that what we were doing is right," said James Gates, 
chief of Caltrans' office of earthquake engineering. 
</P>
<P>
 He said most of the damage to the bridges was predictable and would have been 
prevented if the structures had been retrofitted. Only one of the eight bridges 
that collapsed in the quake was not scheduled for seismic strengthening. 
</P>
<P>
 Gates said officials believe there was not the extensive movement at several 
sites that had been first reported and led engineers to speculate that 
retrofitting might not have saved some of the bridges. 
</P>
<P>
 His comments were based on a report issued by the Post Earthquake 
Investigation Team, a group of engineers who were dispatched to Los Angeles to 
comb through the wreckage of heavily damaged and collapsed bridges in an effort 
to determine some of the causes of their failure. 
</P>
<P>
 Their findings, written to serve as a guide for engineers who are designing 
new bridges or retrofitting old structures, pointed out several potential 
trouble spots that the team said probably contributed to some of the collapses 
in the Jan. 17 quake. 
</P>
<P>
 In particular, members urged Caltrans to conduct more studies on the flares at 
the tops of columns and certain kinds of abutments that caused the ends of some 
bridges to break away from the land. 
</P>
<P>
 Gates said that in bridges designed in the early 1970s, flares were added to 
the tops of columns as an aesthetic feature that would break away in an 
earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 As it turned out, he said, the flares on the Simi Valley Freeway did not break 
away and forced weaker sections of the columns to fail, causing a bridge to 
collapse. 
</P>
<P>
 The department, he said, will search for any other bridges that might be like 
them and re-examine them for possible inclusion in the retrofitting program. 
</P>
<P>
 For an unknown reason, he said, the bridges had fewer columns than most 
bridges, meaning that each one would have to carry a heavier load than normal. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the team recommended further study of the impact of vertical forces 
on bridges during the Northridge quake, Gates said he believes those forces 
will not turn out to be a contributing factor to the collapses. 
</P>
<P>
 "Earthquakes are very complicated and there was a significant vertical 
component in this earthquake. It's influence on structures we still don't know 
but my gut feeling is (it did not have much impact)," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 His opinion differs from that of Caltrans chief bridge engineer James E. 
Roberts, who has said he believes the strong vertical forces may have been a 
major factor in the failure of bridges.

3 YOUTHS SHOT NEAR SCHOOL IN SAN DIEGO; VIOLENCE: RACIAL CONFLICT APPARENTLY 
SPARKED DRIVE-BY INCIDENT, POLICE SAY. THE VICTIMS ARE IN GOOD CONDITION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Three teen-agers were wounded in a drive-by shooting after an apparent racial 
confrontation involving gang members in front of a school Wednesday, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The gunfire hit Tracy Jackson, an 18-year-old volunteer teacher's aide, in the 
ribs; he was hospitalized in good condition, authorities said. The two other 
victims, a 13-year-old student wounded in the hand and a 17-year-old student 
shot in the foot, were also in good condition. 
</P>
<P>
 The shooting occurred about 2:55 p.m. as the Gompers Secondary School was 
letting out for the day in a working-class, racially mixed neighborhood in 
southeast San Diego. It apparently resulted from a racial altercation in which 
a group of about 10 white and African American students threw rocks at a pickup 
truck carrying two Asian students, according to San Diego Police Lt. Chris 
Ellis. Gang language was also "thrown around," Ellis said. 
</P>
<P>
 The pickup truck then stopped, made a U-turn and drove past the group of 
rock-throwers, police said. One of the occupants fired at least eight 
.45-caliber rounds at the group and the truck sped away, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police suspect that the Asian youths are gang members but do not believe that 
the shooting victims are, officials said. Jackson and one other victim are 
African American and the third wounded youth is white, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Interracial conflict between Asian, African American and Latino gangs in the 
neighborhood is not uncommon, Ellis said. But he said recent months have been 
calm. This is the first such incident outside the school and, despite the 
city's growing gang problem, the worst shooting incident outside a San Diego 
school since 1979, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is barbaric," said City Councilman George Stevens, who rushed to the 
scene. "This is insane. This can no longer be tolerated. Society has become 
nothing but violence, violence, violence." 
</P>
<P>
 School board member Shirley Weber said the city schools "have got to do more 
in terms of interracial relationships. We have to learn to deal with the 
interracial conflicts that are there." 
</P>
<P>
 The Gompers Secondary School serves seventh- through 12th-graders from the 
immediate neighborhood and other students who are bused in, according to Norma 
Trost, a spokeswoman for the city school district.

STUDY SEES BENEFITS IN SMOG CHECK OVERHAUL; POLLUTION: TEST-ONLY CENTERS 
ORDERED BY THE EPA WOULD CREATE 8,378 JOBS, ECONOMIC REPORT SAYS. OPPONENTS OF 
THE FEDERAL PLAN DISPUTE THE CLAIMS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Overhauling California's Smog Check program as ordered by the Clinton 
Administration would boost the state's economy by $2.1 billion and create 8,378 
full-time jobs by 2002, economic consultants claim in a new report. 
</P>
<P>
 Funded by the American Lung Assn., the economic study contradicts the fears of 
Gov. Pete Wilson and state lawmakers who oppose the federal effort, which would 
create a new network of test-only centers for checking California cars for 
excess emissions. State leaders have long argued that such a program would put 
thousands of people out of work at 9,000 private Smog Check stations that 
currently both conduct tests and repair vehicles that fail. 
</P>
<P>
 The consultants, with SRI International of Menlo Park, concluded that 598 of 
the nearly 1,600 Smog Check mechanics and technicians would lose jobs under the 
federal proposal. But they maintain that the loss would be more than offset 
because 2,575 new inspectors and 1,634 mechanics would be needed to conduct 
"more stringent and thorough" tests and repairs under the federal plan. The 
study is to be released at a Sacramento press conference today. 
</P>
<P>
 The consultants also conclude that 4,561 jobs would be created to construct 
the inspection stations. The net gain to the economy between 1994 and 2002 
would reach $2.1 billion, including $805 million in construction and start-up 
of the new test stations, the report says. 
</P>
<P>
 "Building the network of inspection stations . . . would have an immediate 
positive economic impact in California," the consultants say. "Operation of the 
130-station network would create ongoing employment and economic activity." 
</P>
<P>
 The group's findings are certain to be controversial because the battle, which 
pits the Clinton Administration against a bipartisan group of California 
lawmakers and Wilson, still is being waged over how to overhaul the state 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents of the federal plan on Wednesday had not yet seen the study, but 
said they remain dubious about its claims. They say separating tests from 
repairs not only would harm the car-testing industry but also would 
inconvenience motorists. 
</P>
<P>
 As proposed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the new Smog Check 
system would have California motorists take their cars to privately owned 
emissions testing centers that are overseen by state contracts. Vehicles 
needing repairs then would be taken to regular mechanics. The EPA says the 
change is necessary to cut down on fraud in the repair business. 
</P>
<P>
 But service station owners vehemently oppose that proposal, and state 
legislators and Wilson defied the EPA by passing a law to keep the test and 
repair stations intact and crack down on fraud with extra policing of mechanics 
and random roadside testing of cars. The new program is supposed to begin next 
January. 
</P>
<P>
 For months, the EPA has threatened to impose economic sanctions on the state 
for defying its order and violating the federal Clean Air Act. The EPA started 
-- and then abruptly stopped -- the process of freezing millions of dollars in 
federal highway funds. Clinton Administration officials say they stopped the 
sanctions process because it would hurt Los Angeles' earthquake recovery 
efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, several other states with auto inspection programs, including 
Nevada and New York, also have defied the EPA order because they are awaiting 
resolution of the California debate. 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives of the lung association, who support the EPA approach, say 
they hired SRI International a few months ago to try to settle the debate over 
the economic impact. 
</P>
<P>
 "There has been so much misinformation floating around in Sacramento in terms 
of whether this (EPA proposal) is really a dreadful thing for the small gas 
station or whether it is opening up a whole new world of test and repair of 
vehicles. This shows the latter is true -- that it is a boon to the economy," 
said Gladys Meade, a clean-air activist with the lung association. 
</P>
<P>
 But Charlie Peters, who represents an association of mechanics, said the 
test-only centers would hurt the overall industry and only generate revenue for 
the few government contractors who would operate them. Peters opposes both the 
EPA plan and the new state law, saying the emphasis should not be on where the 
tests occur but on establishing standards for the repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tell me about all the jobs it will create, because I have difficulty in 
picturing those. It's a 30-second test and it won't lead to increased repairs. 
The repair industry just gets a huge nothing," he said.

PRIEST ON TRIAL DENIES TAKING CHURCH MONEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MACK REED, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nearly two years after his arrest, a Roman Catholic priest from Simi Valley 
took the witness stand on his own behalf Wednesday to deny that he embezzled 
$60,000 in collection money from two Ventura County churches. 
</P>
<P>
 Father David Dean Piroli, 37, sat in the witness box in crisp white clerical 
collar and black tunic for nearly six hours, speaking in clear, measured 
phrases about the case that has scandalized his former parishes. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked by defense attorney Richard Beada if he ever took money for his own use 
from St. Peter Claver Church in Simi Valley or Sacred Heart Church in Saticoy, 
Piroli was adamant. 
</P>
<P>
 "No I did not," he said. "No I did not." 
</P>
<P>
 On May 29, 1992, Hollywood police arrested Piroli on drug and embezzlement 
charges after finding him in a church car with a Mexican man named Israel 
Palacios. Police found $10,000 in cash, church collection envelopes and traces 
of cocaine in the car. Church officials later posted bond for Piroli. 
</P>
<P>
 On June 3, church employees found another $50,000 in cash and parishioners' 
donation checks stuffed into boxes and bags in Piroli's bedroom and office. 
Piroli vanished the same day and was arrested about eight weeks later in 
Calexico, driving into the United States in a newly purchased car with two 
illegal immigrants in the trunk, one of them Palacios. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hollywood charges were dropped because the amount of cocaine was too small 
to justify prosecution and the suspected embezzlement at a Simi Valley church 
was out of their jurisdiction, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Ventura County Grand Jury indicted Piroli on two counts of grand 
theft, leading to the trial that gave the priest a chance Wednesday to offer 
some explanations. 
</P>
<P>
 Piroli testified that he was trying to put Palacios on a plane back to his 
family to save him from drug addiction. 
</P>
<P>
 Piroli told the jury he had just taken the cocaine away from the man, and $900 
of the money under the car's floor mat was his -- stashed there for 
safekeeping. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was becoming addicted to cocaine," Piroli testified. "I believe the 
problems would not exist if he was away (from Los Angeles)." 
</P>
<P>
 Piroli said that two cocaine-dusted matchboxes found in the car belonged to 
Palacios. The priest had persuaded Palacios to leave them behind. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told him to get rid of it (because) he could not go through an 
international airport with it," Piroli said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police have testified that they spotted money sticking out from under the 
car's floor mat and discovered hundreds more in bills underneath it. 
</P>
<P>
 But Piroli testified that he kept $900 under the Chevrolet's floor mat "for 
emergencies" because he carried no credit cards and never could be sure a bank 
would be open if he needed it. 
</P>
<P>
 But he could not explain how the rest of the cash found by police got into the 
car. 
</P>
<P>
 Piroli also testified that he kept $8,000 to $10,000 in his bedside cabinet -- 
his personal collection of silver certificates, rare currency and silver 
Kennedy half-dollars that his father had given him, along with cash gifts from 
parishioners. And he said he kept some donation checks from parishioners 
uncashed because he believed they were too poor to spare the money. 
</P>
<P>
 But Piroli told jurors he had no idea how the rest of the collection envelopes 
and bundles of cash and checks totaling about $50,000 got into his bedroom and 
office. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked to account for the three-inch layer of cash found in his underwear 
drawer by church employees, Piroli testified it was not his. "I wouldn't keep 
something dirty in with my underwear," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He also could not explain the presence of about 100 door and car keys 
parishioners said they found amid the cash, although he said he owned sets of 
keys to his parents' house and his old Toyota and a set of keys to a Santa 
Paula house given him by the parishioner who lived there. 
</P>
<P>
 Beada led Piroli through an account of the eight weeks between his 
disappearance from St. Peter Claver Church and his arrest at the Mexican border 
July 31, 1992, 
</P>
<P>
 Piroli said he abandoned the church car in Burbank, where he bought another 
car for $7,000 from his mother. He then drove Palacios via Ensenada to Mexico 
City, where the man was reunited with his family. 
</P>
<P>
 A few weeks later, Piroli said he traveled briefly back to the San Fernando 
Valley to discuss his case with Bishop G. Patrick Ziemann. He then went back to 
Mexico City and brought Palacios back across the border, hoping the man could 
help explain the arrest to the bishop, Piroli testified.

 The Clinton Administration has decided against providing earthquake-stricken 
California with the unusually high level of disaster aid that Florida received 
after Hurricane Andrew to repair roads, schools and other damaged public 
facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 A bipartisan group of California officials, led by Republican Gov. Pete Wilson 
and Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein, began pressing the White House shortly 
after the Jan. 17 temblor for 100% reimbursement of public works reconstruction 
costs -- just as the Bush Administration gave Florida in September, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Administration, citing a new "fiscally responsible" policy, insists 
that California pay 10% of most of the estimated $3.4 billion to repair public 
sector damage in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Administration officials said the Florida aid package was sweetened by 
political necessity, pointing out that it was delivered two months before the 
1992 presidential election and against the advice of federal emergency 
administrators. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our position is that it's appropriate for states to bear 10% of the cost for 
the total amount in order to ensure better accountability in the spending of 
those funds," said Tom Epstein, White House liaison for California. "That has 
been our consistent position since this Administration took office." 
</P>
<P>
 The 10% formula was applied last summer during the Midwest floods, the first 
major federal disaster on the Clinton Administration's watch. 
</P>
<P>
 The $3.4 billion for rebuilding public facilities is contained in the 
$8.6-billion earthquake aid package that is moving through Congress and is 
expected to land on the President's desk this week. While the federal 
reimbursement formulas are not subject to legislative approval, White House 
officials say they consider the 100% formula "politically unacceptable" on 
Capitol Hill. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, Wilson Administration officials and other Republicans said they 
intend to keep pushing for full reimbursement. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the President ought to do as much for California as was done for 
Florida," said Assembly Republican Leader Jim Brulte. 
</P>
<P>
 California Democrats say Clinton will not budge and that the fight is over. 
Officials who continue to complain risk annoying the White House and could 
jeopardize funding for other California projects, they warn. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's one thing to say we're trying to do the best for California and 
we want 100% reimbursement," said Rep. Julian C. Dixon (D-Los Angeles), who 
helped steer the Administration's aid package through the House. "It's another 
thing to be real and say we have a new Democratic President who has come out 
with a very generous 90-10 formula and that's the deal. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really think it is a dead issue at this point." 
</P>
<P>
 Funds to repair public structures make up one of two major forms of disaster 
relief provided by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. They are used to 
rebuild mass transit, roads, libraries, schools, universities, sewers, water 
systems and other state or local government-owned facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 In most federally declared disasters, FEMA pays 75% of the cost of repairing 
government structures and systems. But in cases of catastrophic disasters such 
as the Florida hurricane and the Northridge quake, the cost-share ratios often 
are adjusted to further help financially battered states and local communities. 
</P>
<P>
 With the Northridge quake, the federal government will provide 75% 
reimbursement for the first $300 million in damages. The Administration changed 
the reimbursement level for the remaining $3.1 billion in costs, agreeing to 
pay 90% of that amount. 
</P>
<P>
 Under this arrangement, California's share of public facility repairs will 
amount to approximately $417 million, according to damage estimates from the 
Northridge quake released Tuesday by the state Office of Emergency Assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 In Florida's case, FEMA paid $1.7 billion and Florida $32 million for public 
sector repairs, according to FEMA officials. 
</P>
<P>
 If California had been treated the same as Florida, the state would pay only 
$75 million -- a saving of $342 million.

SENATE DELAYS $8.6-BILLION QUAKE AID BILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN C. MILLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Senate delayed passage of the $8.6-billion California earthquake aid 
package Wednesday, but the massive emergency bill still appeared to be headed 
to President Clinton by the end of the week. 
</P>
<P>
 Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.) vowed that the Senate will 
not leave for its midwinter recess "until this legislation is completed in a 
form to be sent to the President." 
</P>
<P>
 During its lengthy deliberations, the Senate took two steps that avoided the 
need for potentially time-consuming negotiations with the House, which 
overwhelmingly passed the relief bill last week. They concerned the two 
controversial issues sparked by the aid package: benefits for illegal 
immigrants and how to pay for the massive relief bill. 
</P>
<P>
 The Senate adopted a compromise measure to tighten restrictions on some aid to 
illegal immigrants. It prohibits longer-term aid for undocumented residents and 
requires that federal agencies take "reasonable steps" to determine the legal 
status of an applicant for housing, food stamps or loans of 90 days or longer. 
</P>
<P>
 Humanitarian aid, including short-term shelter, would not be affected by the 
ban. 
</P>
<P>
 Senators also rejected a sweeping bipartisan proposal offered by Sen. Bob 
Kerrey (D-Neb.) and five colleagues to add to the bill a package of $94 billion 
in spending cuts over five years. Kerrey's initiative was defeated by a 65-31 
vote after a daylong debate. 
</P>
<P>
 The Senate is considering a bill that is not substantially different from the 
version adopted by the House a week ago. The Senate bill contains $3.44 billion 
in largely non-controversial budget cuts -- only slightly more than the $2.5 
billion approved by the House. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal disaster aid has traditionally been funded by adding the sums to the 
budget deficit. But, reflecting intense concern over new deficit spending, 
various senators are also proposing additional lists of deeper spending cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 The urgency of the need for swift earthquake aid was underscored by senators 
who noted that the Department of Transportation has nearly reached its 
$100-million cap on emergency spending for a single state. In addition, the 
Federal Emergency Management Agency, which last week shifted most of its 
resources to humanitarian needs in California, has only enough funds to last 10 
more days. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) said that victims of the Jan. 17 temblor have 
submitted nearly 300,000 applications for FEMA aid, 21,659 submissions for 
Small Business Administration loans and 13,717 requests for Housing and Urban 
Development rental housing subsidies. And she said that 100,000 applications 
for emergency food stamps had been approved. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill includes $4.7 billion for FEMA to provide individual assistance and 
temporary housing and rebuild schools, water systems and other public 
facilities; $1.35 billion to the DOT to rebuild damaged freeways and bridges; 
$1.1 billion in low-interest SBA loans to assist homeowners, renters and small 
businesses and $200 million for HUD rent subsidies. 
</P>
<P>
 A hurdle to the bill's passage was removed when Feinstein, Sen. Barbara Boxer 
(D-Calif.), HUD Secretary Henry G. Cisneros and other Administration officials 
negotiated a compromise with Sen. Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.) on his proposal to 
toughen a House amendment prohibiting non-emergency aid to illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 The modification, reached during a meeting in the Capitol, requires federal 
agencies to take reasonable steps to determine whether any applicant for 
assistance of 90 days or longer is in the country legally. Reid had proposed to 
exempt emergency aid but did not specify a time frame for what constituted 
non-emergency aid. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein called the measure "legal and enforceable" and maintained it would 
not "create gridlock in the preliminary screening for emergency aid." And, she 
added, "It is ample time for somebody to be required to demonstrate that they 
are here lawfully." 
</P>
<P>
 She said that it would be up to FEMA, HUD and the SBA to "determine what they 
consider reasonable steps." The amendment was adopted by voice vote. 
</P>
<P>
 The House version of the illegal immigrant aid amendment did not require 
federal officials to check legal status. Rep. Julian C. Dixon (D-Los Angeles), 
who quarterbacked House passage of the earthquake bill, said the revised ban on 
aid to illegal immigrants was acceptable to him.

CAPITOL JOURNAL: CRIME SUMMIT DIDN'T LEAVE LASTING MARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE SKELTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Unlike Lincoln's Gettysburg Address or even Speaker Willie Brown's economic 
summit, Gov. Pete Wilson's convocation on crime probably will not long be 
remembered. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that the two-day event this week at the Hollywood Presbyterian Church 
wasn't a good thing to do. It clearly was, both in terms of public policy 
debate and Wilson politically. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a carefully orchestrated campaign extravaganza that undoubtedly gave 
the Republican governor a slight boost in his uphill race for reelection. The 
fact it was staged as Treasurer Kathleen Brown was embarking on a statewide 
tour to officially launch her gubernatorial bid was not a mere coincidence. 
Wilson was able to showcase his "tough on crime" positions while subliminally 
inviting the public to compare them with Brown's, which the governor will try 
to characterize as squishy soft. 
</P>
<P>
 Underscoring Wilson's political reliance on the crime issue, a GOP spokesman 
went to Brown's kickoff in Burbank and distributed to reporters a flyer with 
side-by-side mug shots of the Democratic front-runner and former California 
Chief Justice Rose Elizabeth Bird, whose death penalty rulings prompted her 
ouster by voters. 
</P>
<P>
 So one does not need to be a cynic -- only a realist -- to see that Wilson's 
"summit" was motivated primarily by politics. 
</P>
<P>
 That said, so what? Good politics often leads to good policy, or at least 
policy demanded by the public. And whether opposing conservative and liberal 
factions in the Legislature now can reach a consensus among themselves and the 
governor on anti-crime bills will be the test of whether Wilson's big photo op 
also was a policy success. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Speaker Brown set the standard a year ago with his economic summit in Los 
Angeles. Most of the Capitol and the corporate community were skeptical. The 
concept of this "tax and spend" liberal helping to improve the business climate 
seemed to defy logic. But Brown committed himself to doing just that. And, 
largely because of his leadership, the Legislature and the governor compromised 
on a heralded package of economic stimulus bills. 
</P>
<P>
 But there are different dynamics at play now. For Sacramento, Brown aligning 
himself with business was like redbaiter Richard Nixon going to Communist 
China. Wilson trying to lock up "thugs" is nothing new. Any dramatic impact is 
short-lived. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, the political momentum for getting tougher with criminals has been 
building for months, largely because of the Polly Klaas murder, the popular 
"three strikes" initiative and gang violence. Politicians have been reading the 
polls. The demands are there -- throw away the keys and don't coddle the 
criminals. The lawmakers really don't need a new prod from Wilson's summit. 
</P>
<P>
 And unlike the economic summit, where CEOs and economists offered an 
assortment of ideas that educated legislators, many lawmakers in Hollywood said 
they heard little new from the array of prosecutors, victims' rights advocates, 
cops and community activists. More importantly, they seemed as uncompromising 
in their views when they left as when they arrived. 
</P>
<P>
 "It makes it hard to compromise on a hard-line position when you know you're 
right and see things starting to move (your way)," said Assembly GOP Caucus 
Chairman Curt Pringle of Garden Grove. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 One elected official seeking compromise and being rebuffed was Atty. Gen. Dan 
Lungren. The Republican told how he had been in a San Francisco high-rise last 
summer and left just before a madman with 50-round magazines began gunning down 
eight people, including two of his luncheon companions. 
</P>
<P>
 "I, for the life of me, can't understand why you need to have 50-round clips," 
Lungren said. Turning to Peter Kasler, a Sonoma lawyer and noted opponent of 
gun controls, the attorney general asked: "Isn't there something we can do to 
reach an accommodation?" 
</P>
<P>
 Kasler responded that if others in the high-rise had been armed, they might 
have taken out the assailant. Lungren countered that the mass murderer on the 
New York subway last December finally was subdued by unarmed passengers when he 
stopped firing to reload his 15-round weapon. Kasler answered, "Criminals don't 
pay any attention to such laws." 
</P>
<P>
 Lungren gave up. And that exchange symbolized much of the summit. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Wilson, Lungren, Speaker Brown and the roughly 50 legislators who 
attended were forced to hear opposing views from people they might ordinarily 
ignore. They listened to the firsthand horror stories of victims. The political 
atmosphere was non-threatening because nobody was counting votes. And the 
summit was held outside the Capitol, somewhere closer to the real world. 
</P>
<P>
 And for all that it was beneficial, if probably not memorable.

TRADE FLAP CASTS SHADOW OVER HOSOKAWA'S U.S. VISIT; COMMERCE: JAPANESE AND 
AMERICAN OFFICIALS BOTH RESIST COMPROMISE. PRIME MINISTER IS DUE IN WASHINGTON 
ON FRIDAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES GERSTENZANG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 American and Japanese officials engaged in diplomatic brinkmanship Wednesday 
on the eve of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's visit here, with both sides 
refusing to compromise in an increasingly bitter trade dispute. 
</P>
<P>
 Japanese Ambassador Takakazu Kuriyama said his nation will not yield to an 
American demand that the two countries determine a specific method to measure 
increases in Japan's purchases of U.S. goods and services and firmly reminded 
the Clinton Administration that "any negotiation requires compromise on both 
sides." 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. response was blunt. "What we will wait for until hell freezes over is 
an agreement that there will be measurements," Deputy Treasury Secretary Roger 
Altman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The argument between the two countries stems from an agreement reached by 
President Clinton and Hosokawa's predecessor, Kiichi Miyazawa, just hours 
before Clinton left Tokyo last July. 
</P>
<P>
 That agreement, couched in vague language that has come back to haunt 
officials in Washington and Tokyo, committed the two nations to devising a 
framework that would lead to a reduction in Japan's towering trade surplus. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States has since insisted that unbendable measurements must be 
developed to determine whether that goal is being met in four areas -- sales to 
Japan of telecommunications equipment, medical equipment, insurance and autos 
and auto parts. 
</P>
<P>
 American officials have insisted that they will not accept an agreement that 
papers over their differences with Japan, raising the possibility that the 
angry trade relationship will finally rupture. 
</P>
<P>
 But much of the heated rhetoric is common in such negotiations, and U.S. 
officials have privately sent signals suggesting that neither side wants the 
situation to deteriorate into a trade war. 
</P>
<P>
 Negotiations have taken place in Washington and Tokyo, with the aim of 
reaching an agreement before Hosokawa's visit Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 But U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor said that, as of today, the two 
nations "are stuck on dead center. We are looking for tangible progress." 
</P>
<P>
 American officials temporarily broke off talks Tuesday night, and the two 
sides did not meet Wednesday, in anticipation of the negotiations resuming at a 
higher level today when Japanese Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata joins the 
discussions. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton has come under increasing pressure in Congress to impose trade 
sanctions if the talks do not move the two countries closer to more open trade 
relations and a reduction in Japan's $132-billion trade surplus, nearly half of 
which is with the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Max Baucus (D-Mont.), chairman of the Senate Finance Committee's 
subcommittee on trade, said that without demonstrable progress, there will be 
strong support for imposition of economic sanctions intended to force Japan to 
open its markets to more American products. 
</P>
<P>
 His counterpart in the House, Rep. Sam Gibbons (D-Fla.), said any agreements 
reached by Clinton and Hosokawa "must provide for tangible and measurable 
results. If they do not, the United States should reject them and pursue an 
alternative course of action that will truly restore some semblance of balance 
and equity to our bilateral trade relationship." 
</P>
<P>
 Kuriyama, the Japanese ambassador, said Hata's presence at the negotiating 
table today will reflect Japan's readiness to make "every effort possible to 
reach agreement by Friday." 
</P>
<P>
 He said Japan does not oppose "objective criteria" or "numerical criteria" 
that would be used to guide the U.S.-Japanese trade relationship. 
</P>
<P>
 But, he said, "What we are opposed to is to set up some sort of numerical or 
quantitative targets or goals to which Japan should commit itself."

YEAR OF THE DOG IS USHERED IN WITH A WHIMPER; CHINA: CITIZENS USED FIRECRACKERS 
FOR 1,000 YEARS TO CELEBRATE THE NEW YEAR WITH A BANG. OFFICIALS NOW SAY THAT'S 
TOO DANGEROUS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Every year for at least 1,000 years, dating from the discovery of gunpowder in 
the Sung Dynasty, the Chinese greeted their New Year with a deafening roar of 
firecrackers, the bigger and louder the better. 
</P>
<P>
 In economic boom times like those of recent years, the streets of the towns 
and cities were ankle deep in the red wrappers of spent firecrackers, some the 
size of soup cans, by the next morning. In the afterglow of such explosive 
evenings, a sulfurous haze blanketed the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 But at midnight Wednesday in Beijing, the Year of the Dog came in with a 
whimper, not a bang. Only a few stray detonations punctuated the still night. 
Even the politically rebellious university district in the capital's northwest 
corner was quiet except for distant rumblings from suburbs outside the Beijing 
district. 
</P>
<P>
 Disturbed by what they claimed was an alarming number of injuries in past 
celebrations, many major cities banned firecrackers this year. But the ban was 
not universal. 
</P>
<P>
 In Shanghai, the neon-lit main street, Nanjing Road, was a cacophony of 
revelry and minor explosions. Officials in the freewheeling business capital 
refused to go along with the prohibition. 
</P>
<P>
 In stark contrast, it was an eerie, nearly silent night Wednesday in Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials attempted to compensate for the absence of pyrotechnics by staging 
lavish television specials and festive street shows, some performed by costumed 
People's Liberation Army troops. 
</P>
<P>
 To emphasize the public safety aspect of the firecracker ban, Beijing 
Television Network aired a program that featured interviews with 
ophthalmologists and people blinded or maimed by fireworks accidents. One 
segment focused on a 10-year-old boy who lost four fingers in a firecracker 
explosion. 
</P>
<P>
 "Please don't take my picture until my fingers grow back," the boy begged the 
camera operator. 
</P>
<P>
 The Beijing Evening News newspaper published a glowing article about Dong 
Shuchen, an elderly woman who voluntarily handed over to the Zhanlanlu police 
firecrackers she had purchased to celebrate her son's marriage during the 
three-day Spring Festival holiday, as the New Year is known here, that begins 
today. 
</P>
<P>
 Historically, many Chinese believed that the staccato explosions of fireworks 
frightened off ghosts and evil spirits. 
</P>
<P>
 Firecrackers are traditional at nearly every festive or auspicious occasion, 
and for the Chinese New Year, families traditionally spent the equivalent of 
$20 on them. But the newspaper said Dong gladly abandoned tradition for civil 
responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
 "My family should take the lead in obeying the regulation," the newspaper 
quoted her as saying. "We will be just as happy at my son's wedding ceremony. I 
felt good about handing over the firecrackers." 
</P>
<P>
 Shopkeepers attempted to put a brave face on the money lost from the 
firecracker ban. 
</P>
<P>
 Fu Gongshen, manager of the Chaoyan Yuanfan Sundry Goods store in East 
Beijing, said his business dropped $10,000 because of the ban. 
</P>
<P>
 But he said he was glad to be relieved of the worry that one of the 
firecrackers he sold might injure a customer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last year I was sitting on the edge of a volcano of worry," he said. "This 
year I am happy to take the economic loss in exchange for the social benefits." 
</P>
<P>
 Not everyone, of course, was happy about the ban. 
</P>
<P>
 Two boys, their faces covered with sticky sugar from the candied apples they 
were munching, watched with bored expressions as army acrobats performed at the 
Chaoyan District New Year's show staged by local officials to make up for the 
missing fireworks. 
</P>
<P>
 The two boys, ages 13 and 14, reckoned that they would watch television and 
play video games instead of igniting firecrackers. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the mind of the elder boy, a plump child with a mischievous look, the 
ban was a real shame. 
</P>
<P>
 "We really liked firecrackers," he said. "It's colorful, and you can really 
make a lot of noise."

PUBLIC FOCUS ON VIOLENT FELONS PUSHES HEALTH ISSUE OFF SCREEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN BRENNAN, TIMES POLL DIRECTOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton's arguments for massive health care reform rest on the 
notion that a bona fide crisis exists in America, requiring quick and radical 
solutions. 
</P>
<P>
 He has labored hard to get the public to buy that argument, with some success. 
But just as the health debate heats up, public attention seems to be drifting 
away as a crime "crisis" grabs the spotlight. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's health reform initiative is under attack from a host of sources, and 
he needs strong public support to maintain legislative momentum on Capitol 
Hill. But there is no rock-solid public backing for drastic health care reform 
the likes of which the President is proposing. 
</P>
<P>
 Americans' concern over the health care issue has bobbed up and down in recent 
years. Before the 1992 presidential election, it was only a blip on the issue 
screen, ranked lower than both the economy and illegal drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1992 campaign made health care reform an issue, and Clinton boosted public 
concerns with his nationally televised speech last September. 
</P>
<P>
 In a Los Angeles Times Poll taken right after the address, 27% of Americans 
listed health care as the nation's top or second most important problem -- up 
from 14% at the beginning of 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 But as one of the biggest political fights in decades begins, attention to 
health care is sliding. Between September and January, the share of Americans 
naming it as a top national concern in Times polls fell to 12%. At the same 
time, the percentage calling crime a top problem has increased from 18% to 25%. 
Crime, not health care, is now cited as the country's top social problem. 
</P>
<P>
 The surge in public concern about crime, which has occurred only since the 
middle of last year, has little statistical basis. FBI figures show a drop in 
serious crime in the first half of 1993, and new polls indicate people feel no 
less safe in their neighborhoods and homes than they have in the past. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, there is a lot to suggest that the current concern over crime has 
been spawned by massive attention to a series of high-profile, violent murders 
and shootings. 
</P>
<P>
 This situation bears close resemblance to the heightened concern over illegal 
drug use that seized the media and the nation after the 1986 cocaine overdose 
death of college basketball star Len Bias. 
</P>
<P>
 In a few months, drugs vaulted from the bottom to the top of the public's 
issue list, dropping back when the media shifted attention to the breaking 
Iran-Contra scandal. Ironically, studies showed that drug use among teen-agers 
was generally down then. It is rising now, but the nation is transfixed with 
violent felons, not drug offenders. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor is it crying out for fast, revolutionary health care changes. The number 
of Americans who feel that changes in the health care system should be phased 
in over time edged up from 51% last September to 55% in January. Support for 
the Clinton plan itself -- while still a plurality -- dropped from 54% to 47% 
in the same period, while opposition increased. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no way to know how long the current furor over crime will last. But 
as long as it does, it will compete directly with health care for the public's 
attention, making it harder for the President to maintain the crisis mentality 
that would help muster support on Capitol Hill. Nation's Top Problems

NEW LOAN FUND BANKS ON BETTER DAY-CARE CENTERS; THE PRIVATE PROJECT OFFERS 
FUNDS AND EXPERTISE TO HELP STRUGGLING AGENCIES IMPROVE THEIR FACILITIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Lead paint chipping off the ramp to a highway bridge has so contaminated the 
back yard of one day-care center that the children are not allowed outside. 
</P>
<P>
 But at Kangaroo's Pouch, a day-care center in nearby Chelsea, the future looks 
brighter because of an unusual loan program. 
</P>
<P>
 The Child Care Capital Investment Fund has loaned 23 centers in eastern 
Massachusetts between $1,000 and $100,000 each at 5% interest for renovation, 
construction or refinancing -- reaching more than 1,000 area children so far, 
director Carl Sussman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the independent program -- which is funded by the Ford Foundation, the 
United Way, the Hyams Foundation and eight other non-governmental sources -- 
began three years ago, no center in the fund's $1.1-million portfolio has 
defaulted. 
</P>
<P>
 And a newer program, which combines grants and loans for up to $17,000, is 
aimed at smaller centers that cannot contemplate major projects but still 
urgently need to improve their facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the centers that have benefited is the North End Union, a settlement 
house in Boston's Italian section that has been offering English classes, job 
counseling and other services for 120 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Without a $100,000 loan from the fund, said director Robert G. Dello Russo, 
"we would have had to close" because of fumes from a wood-refinishing class in 
its building. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the center completed a $400,000 renovation of its 102-year-old main 
building in October. Dello Russo recently showed off revamped classrooms, new 
fire exits and sprinklers and a renovated kitchen filled with the aroma of a 
spaghetti-and-meatballs lunch for the children. 
</P>
<P>
 Donations have poured into the fund as neighbors hear about the improvements 
-- a bonus that Sussman said he welcomes. 
</P>
<P>
 Loan recipients said a key to the fund's success is the technical help that it 
offers -- whether in finding an architect, programming computers or teaching 
day-care centers how to budget for debt. 
</P>
<P>
 After fund officials helped with refinancing the mortgage so that Kangaroo's 
Pouch will own its building twice as fast while keeping monthly payments the 
same, engineers and architects affiliated with the fund are now helping the 
center assess new locations. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not free, but it will be cheaper, and they (fund officials) will find 
all the pieces," center director Jose Rivera said. 
</P>
<P>
 Because they receive barely enough in fees or state subsidies to meet costs, 
day-care centers often find themselves in cramped and crumbling quarters. 
</P>
<P>
 For the same reason, it is especially hard for day-care providers to borrow 
money. Usually, the result is that centers fall slowly into disrepair, which 
Sussman said can dampen staff morale, contribute to already-high turnover and 
reduce children's enjoyment and parents' interest. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you don't . . . force yourself to start thinking about it, you will be in 
the same place 20 years from now," said Danny LeBlanc, who runs the North Shore 
Community Action Program in Peabody, Mass. Using a $100,000 loan and $230,000 
in grants and reserves, his agency transformed the leaking basement of a former 
high school into a center for 70 children. 
</P>
<P>
 Designed by an architect recommended by the fund, the center includes an 
indoor sandbox, and each of its classroom doors looks different. Teacher Brenda 
Dion said children are more relaxed there than in the agency's older 
classrooms. And because it is sized for preschoolers -- something LeBlanc said 
took thought, not money -- children are happier. 
</P>
<P>
 "When they first came in here, they were thrilled they could see themselves in 
the mirror in the bathroom," teacher Donna Bamford said. 
</P>
<P>
 Staff at the United Way of Massachusetts Bay and the Boston-based Hyams 
Foundation decided in the late 1980s that starting a loan fund would be the 
best way to use private money to improve day care locally. 
</P>
<P>
 "We saw it as a way to help low-income children, both to give them a step up 
entering school and to help their parents to become economically 
self-sufficient because they could then get jobs," said Beth Smith, executive 
director of the Hyams Foundation.

ALLIES READY AIR ARMADA FOR POSSIBLE STRIKES; MILITARY: NATO FORCES PREPARE 
SHIPS AND FIGHTERS ALREADY IN THE REGION NEAR BOSNIA. OFFICIALS SAY WEAPONRY IS 
DESIGNED TO LESSEN CIVILIAN CASUALTIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The United States and its European allies began gearing up Wednesday for 
possible air strikes in Bosnia, using allied aircraft already in the region and 
equipped for nighttime bombing, and laser-guided munitions designed to minimize 
civilian casualties. 
</P>
<P>
 Pentagon officials said the air armada would employ more than 100 
fighter-bombers from the United States and five other NATO countries, with 
support from dozens of airborne tankers, reconnaissance aircraft, electronic 
spy planes and AC-130H gunships. 
</P>
<P>
 All are currently enforcing the U.N. "no-fly" zone over Bosnia from air bases 
in Italy and Turkey and from the U.S. aircraft carrier Saratoga, which is in 
the Adriatic Sea. The Navy also has two guided-missile cruisers on station near 
the Saratoga. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said any attacks would not be confined to those specific artillery 
batteries located in violation of the new North Atlantic Treaty Organization 
ban. Instead, allied aircraft would be free to destroy any heavy weapons, or 
related targets, such as ammunition dumps and logistics depots. 
</P>
<P>
 For the moment, officials appear to have ruled out massive allied bombing of 
Bosnian Serb command centers, bridges and other large structures, in hopes of 
limiting any military moves to narrow-gauge "enforcement" action. 
</P>
<P>
 Pentagon strategists said they have pinpointed about 100 heavy weapons -- 
including tanks, artillery, heavy mortars and multiple-launch rocket systems -- 
within the 20-kilometer zone around Sarajevo from which such weapons are 
supposed to be excluded. Most belong to the Bosnian Serbs. 
</P>
<P>
 But officials stressed that the NATO warplanes would be equipped with special 
night-bombardment capability and precision-guided munitions that provide 
unusual accuracy -- a move that they said they hope would limit casualties 
among innocent civilians. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want anyone to get into a position of creating our own Saturday," a 
Pentagon official said, referring to the mortar attack on a marketplace in 
Sarajevo last weekend that prompted NATO to issue Wednesday's ultimatum. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the U.S. warships, the allied flotilla off the Bosnian coast is 
expected to include vessels from France and Britain, which ordered aircraft 
carriers to the area. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials said there still is a chance that NATO will use TPQ-37 
counter-battery radar units, which are capable of locating artillery and mortar 
by tracking their projectiles when they are fired. So far, however, no country 
has volunteered to assign soldiers to the radar units. 
</P>
<P>
 Military officials said the primary reason NATO decided to allow 10 days 
before it begins enforcing its pullback order is to give U.N. peacekeeping 
troops now in Bosnia time to reinforce their defenses. 
</P>
<P>
 Allied war planners have long feared that the Serbs would respond to air 
attacks by retaliating against the peacekeepers. The peacekeeping units -- 
British, French, Spanish, Canadian and Greek troops -- are lightly armed.

NEWS ANALYSIS; FOR A PEOPLE UNDER SIEGE, WARNING'S AIMS FALL SHORT; THREAT: 
LEADERS ACT MORE OUT OF EMBARRASSMENT THAN OUT OF A CLEAR NEW RESOLVE TO STOP 
THE BLOODSHED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Western alliance's ultimatum to the Bosnian Serbs to remove their heavy 
weapons from Sarajevo is not the decisive intervention for which Bosnians had 
hoped, not the end of Bosnia's grueling war -- and not even the end of the 
siege of its battered capital. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather, it is a limited action with limited objectives, launched out of 
Western leaders' embarrassment at their impotence more than out of a clear new 
resolve to stop the Bosnian bloodshed once and for all. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton and other officials, anxious to avoid a quagmire of 
ever-widening military involvement, were careful to keep their commitments 
narrow and their promises small. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have . . . insisted that NATO not commit itself to any objectives it 
cannot achieve," Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
 The North Atlantic Treaty Organization's decisions "are not intended . . . to 
end the conflict or to lift the siege of Sarajevo," another senior official 
said. Sniper fire into the city's streets and blockades of food and other 
supplies will not be affected, he acknowledged. 
</P>
<P>
 "We cannot guarantee that there won't be any further shelling of Sarajevo," a 
White House official added. All NATO can promise, the official said, is that 
"those responsible will pay a very heavy price." 
</P>
<P>
 There were two reasons for the severe limits put in place by NATO. 
</P>
<P>
 One was the painful history of previous threats against the Serbs, from the 
George Bush Administration's 1992 demand for an end to the siege of Sarajevo, 
to the Clinton Administration's 1993 endorsement of a U.N. declaration that the 
city was a "safe area," to NATO's warning only three weeks ago that it was 
ready to use force. In every case, the Serbs paused to take NATO's measure, 
discovered the threats were empty and resumed attacks on civilians. 
</P>
<P>
 But the second reason, which appeared to weigh even more heavily on Clinton, 
was his abiding fear that any new U.S. commitment to the fate of the Bosnians 
might turn into a step toward putting American troops on the ground -- the one 
thing the President has consistently said he will not do. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials were careful not to promise any specific military outcome, such as 
an end to the shelling, for fear that keeping such a pledge might require more 
than they are willing to do. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Clinton spent as much time stressing what he would not do in Bosnia as 
what he would. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our contribution to resolving the Bosnian conflict will be proportionate to 
our interests, no more and no less," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 And he expressed the hope that, in the end, air strikes will not have to be 
launched at all -- if the Bosnian Serbs comply with NATO's demand peaceably. 
</P>
<P>
 If NATO does follow through on its threat -- still a big if -- it will be a 
landmark: not only the first time the West uses force to back up its warnings 
in the former Yugoslav federation but also the first time the Atlantic 
Alliance, formed 45 years ago to block a Soviet invasion of Europe, actually 
launches combat operations. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our nation has clear interests at stake in this conflict," Clinton told 
reporters at the White House. "We have an interest in helping to prevent a 
broader conflict in Europe that is most compelling. We have an interest in 
showing that NATO, history's greatest military alliance, remains a credible 
force for peace in post-Cold War Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have an interest in stemming the destabilizing flows of refugees that this 
horrible conflict is creating. And we clearly have a humanitarian interest in 
helping to prevent the strangulation of Sarajevo and the continuing slaughter 
of innocents in Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
 "These interests do not justify unilateral American intervention in the 
crisis, but they do justify the involvement of America and the exercise of our 
leadership." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton repeated a theme that he has often used on Bosnia and that he used 
again last weekend after a single mortar shell apparently fired by Bosnian Serb 
forces killed 68 people crowded in an outdoor market: Stopping the war is a 
problem for the Bosnians, not the United States, to solve. 
</P>
<P>
 "We must understand that in the end, this conflict must be settled at the 
negotiating table," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton said he asked Secretary of State Warren Christopher to take a more 
active role in the U.N.-sponsored negotiations over a peace plan that would 
partition Bosnia into three states. 
</P>
<P>
 He described the U.S. role as talking to the Bosnian Muslims "to ascertain 
what their legitimate, bedrock requirements are and to share with them as 
clearly and honestly as we can what we think both the political and the 
military situation is. And then, using that as a basis, to go back to do what 
we can to facilitate an end to this conflict." 
</P>
<P>
 In practice, a senior official said, this means that the United States will 
tell the Muslims that they should not try to gain more ground by fighting, but 
should instead seek to cut a deal soon. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, he said, the Administration hopes that the NATO military 
threat will help persuade the Serbs to accede to some of the Muslims' demands 
for more territory.

U.S. RECOGNIZES MACEDONIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The United States recognized the independence of the former Yugoslav republic 
of Macedonia on Wednesday after more than two years of sidestepping the issue 
in deference to North Atlantic Treaty Organization ally Greece. 
</P>
<P>
 A White House statement said that the people of Macedonia had chosen 
independence by democratic means and that recognition could help resolve 
differences with Athens. 
</P>
<P>
 Trying not to offend either side, the Clinton Administration chose to refer to 
the country as "The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia," the name by which 
the Balkan nation was admitted to the United Nations. 
</P>
<P>
 Greece contended that referring to the country as Macedonia implied it had a 
claim on the Greek province also called Macedonia.

HENIE SKATED OFF WITH NORWAY'S LEGACY ON ICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Randy Harvey 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Go figure. Norway, the country that gave the world the original ice princess, 
Sonja Henie, has no figure skaters entered in the 1994 Winter Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
 For people who follow the sport, that is no news flash. Only six Norwegians 
have competed in Olympic figure skating since World War II, none since 1964. 
</P>
<P>
 Henie won a record three gold medals in women's individual competition in 
1928, '32 and '36 and a record 10 straight world championships between 1927 and 
'36. But she had no impact on the sport in her native land. 
</P>
<P>
 Some claim that is because of her purported friendship with Adolf Hitler, who 
fawned over her. But historians here contend it probably has more to do with 
the fact that after her competitive career ended she moved to Southern 
California, where she starred in movies and ice shows and led a much-publicized 
lavish, promiscuous life. 
</P>
<P>
 After becoming a U.S. citizen by marriage in 1940, she lived in a Holmby Hills 
mansion most of the time until her death in 1969. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the world's first female sports stars, Henie left more of a legacy in 
the United States, where figure skating became a popular competitive pursuit 
for girls because of the exposure she gave the sport. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every little girl wanted to be her," said Carol Heiss Jenkins, who won the 
1960 gold medal for the United States. She cited "the fame, the glitter, the 
way she'd glide across the ice." 
</P>
<P>
 Norway, however, discourages the sport. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't put money in figure skating," said Arne Myhrvold, president of the 
Norwegian Olympic Committee. "You have to start children when they are 6 and 7 
years old. We think it's wrong to start sports too early. 
</P>
<P>
 "If another Sonja Henie shows up, we will help her. But we won't spend the 
time or money to create another one." Randy Harvey

NUSSBAUM DEFENDS HIS ACTIONS DURING FOSTER INQUIRY; WHITE HOUSE: OFFICIALS HAVE 
OBJECTED TO PRESIDENTIAL COUNSEL'S CONDUCT IN THE SEARCH OF CLINTON FRIEND'S 
OFFICE AND DISPOSITION OF FILES THERE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN M. BRODER and RONALD J. OSTROW, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Presidential counsel Bernard Nussbaum on Wednesday defended his conduct during 
the investigation of the apparent suicide of White House attorney Vincent 
Foster, saying he was only doing what was required of a lawyer in difficult 
circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
 Law enforcement officials have raised objections to Nussbaum's role in the 
search of Foster's office after his death on July 20, 1993, the disposition of 
files found there and the presence of White House lawyers during questioning of 
potential witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Nussbaum's actions in the aftermath of Foster's death are likely to be 
reviewed by Robert B. Fiske Jr., the recently appointed special counsel who is 
investigating Clinton's role in the ill-fated Whitewater real estate and 
banking affair in Arkansas. 
</P>
<P>
 Foster was a close friend of President Clinton and First Lady Hillary Rodham 
Clinton. He handled some of their personal legal matters, including the sale of 
their interest in Whitewater Development Corp., a failed Ozark Mountain 
vacation property venture. 
</P>
<P>
 Nussbaum's actions during the investigation of Foster's death contributed to 
suspicions that the White House was trying to shield relevant material from 
investigators, fueling the controversy that led Clinton to reluctantly 
authorize appointment of the special counsel in January. 
</P>
<P>
 But Nussbaum, a combative New York lawyer, strenuously defended his actions 
during an interview Wednesday, insisting that he acted properly and ethically 
at all times and never intended to impede the investigation or conceal 
potential White House knowledge or documents. 
</P>
<P>
 Police and government lawyers have complained that Nussbaum did not share with 
them information from files found in Foster's office and that he or his staff 
attorneys sat in on Justice Department interviews of White House employees, 
potentially inhibiting candid responses. 
</P>
<P>
 Nussbaum disputed those assertions. "We did not interfere with the 
investigation one whit," he said. "To accuse me of interference is not to 
understand the role of the lawyer, the obligations of the lawyer." 
</P>
<P>
 He said he had a duty as the President's attorney to protect the 
confidentiality of the Clintons' private records of their Whitewater dealings, 
which were removed from Foster's office and sent to the Clintons' personal 
lawyer, David Kendall of the Washington law firm of Williams & Connolly. 
</P>
<P>
 Legal authorities said it is virtually certain that Nussbaum will be called 
before a grand jury investigating Foster's death and Whitewater under Fiske's 
guidance. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Park Police, which had primary responsibility for investigating 
Foster's death because his body was found on federal parkland in Virginia, have 
complained in a still-secret report that Nussbaum did not allow them to inspect 
the files found in Foster's office, sources who have seen the report said. 
</P>
<P>
 In a 2 1/2-hour session in Foster's office two days after the death, Nussbaum 
sorted through his deputy's papers in the presence of officials from the Park 
Police, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Justice Department. 
Nussbaum placed the documents in three piles -- files relating to official 
government business, Foster's private papers and the Clintons' personal 
materials. 
</P>
<P>
 The Park Police have publicly complained that Nussbaum did not permit them to 
review any of the papers, making it impossible for them to determine whether 
any of the documents would help explain the apparent suicide. 
</P>
<P>
 Nussbaum said some of the files in Foster's office were the Clintons' personal 
property and could not be turned over without their permission. Clinton 
ultimately agreed to yield the files to the Justice Department and began 
turning them over last month. 
</P>
<P>
 The search of Foster's office by Nussbaum and two other White House officials 
the night of his death also has raised questions. 
</P>
<P>
 Nussbaum said he was in Foster's office, with Margaret A. Williams, the First 
Lady's chief of staff, and Patsy Thomasson, a longtime Clinton associate now on 
the White House staff, for about 10 minutes. He said they looked on Foster's 
desk and on other office furniture for a note or evidence of blackmail but 
found nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 During most of that time, Williams sat crying on the sofa while Thomasson and 
Nussbaum conducted the search, Nussbaum said. The Secret Service officially 
secured Foster's office about midmorning the next day. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Park Police have objected to the presence of Nussbaum or members of 
his staff during questioning of assistants in his office, Nussbaum said police 
officers did not complain at the time and raised their objections long after 
the fact. 
</P>
<P>
 "We never cut off people from asking questions," Nussbaum said. "This was not 
a criminal investigation." He said his staff deals with sensitive matters and a 
Park Police officer could have inadvertently raised questions that involved 
national security or privileged information. 
</P>
<P>
 Nussbaum rejected suggestions of a parallel between his actions and the 
insistence by John W. Dean III, counsel to former President Richard Nixon, that 
he attend FBI interrogations of White House employees about Watergate. 
</P>
<P>
 Dean's presence at those sessions, which he used to monitor the government's 
investigation for Nixon, contributed to the resignation of Acting FBI Director 
L. Patrick Gray III, who did not object to Dean's presence. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dean episode should be familiar ground to Nussbaum. He was a senior 
counsel on the House panel that drew up impeachment charges against Nixon and 
in that capacity supervised the work of a young staff member, Hillary Rodham 
Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 Nussbaum said he disagreed with a Justice Department request that the White 
House lawyers stay out of the questioning. "But I acceded to it," he said. 
"Most people went through without lawyers. I wasn't happy about it."

 The last remaining case stemming from the 1991 Tailhook Assn. convention in 
Las Vegas has been dismissed because of insufficient evidence, an attorney said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Of 140 cases stemming from the scandal, not one person has been 
court-martialed.About 50 Navy and Marine officers received administrative 
discipline. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at Quantico Marine Corps Base issued a release Wednesday saying that 
Lt. Gen. Charles C. Krulak had dismissed the case without imposing punishment 
against a Marine Corps lieutenant colonel accused of misconduct. 
</P>
<P>
 It did not identify the colonel, but the attorney for Marine Lt. Col. Cass D. 
Howell identified his client as the defendant. Howell's attorney, David L. Beck 
of Knoxville, Tenn., said all charges against Howell were dismissed because of 
insufficient evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 Howell had been charged with lying and obstructing justice during the Tailhook 
probe. He was also charged with assaulting a Tailhook investigator and with 
spending a night during the convention at the Las Vegas Hilton with a woman 
other than his wife. 
</P>
<P>
 Pentagon investigators concluded that 83 women were assaulted or molested at 
the convention. Many of the women were molested on the hotel's third floor, 
where men lined the hallway and grabbed women as they tried to pass.

FIRM DENIES IT SHREDDED DATA ON WHITEWATER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Rose Law Firm where First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton was a partner 
shredded documents related to the Whitewater Development Corp. last week, a 
newspaper reported Wednesday. The firm emphatically denied the report. 
</P>
<P>
 The Washington Times cited as its source an unidentified Rose employee. 
President and Mrs. Clinton, along with James B. McDougal and his then-wife, 
Susan, were partners in Whitewater, an Arkansas real estate venture. 
</P>
<P>
 In Little Rock, Ark., Ronald M. Clark, managing partner at Rose, said the 
report about shredding Whitewater documents was "totally false . . . . I am 
absolutely sure. I am extremely upset that somebody would allege this." 
</P>
<P>
 Clark said his firm had "no significant documents" concerning the Whitewater 
development. 
</P>
<P>
 Wesley Pruden, editor-in-chief of the Washington Times, said the newspaper 
stands by its story, which he said was based on conversations with "direct and 
corroborating sources" at the law firm. 
</P>
<P>
 The Little Rock office of special counsel Robert B. Fiske Jr. said the report 
would become part of its investigation into Whitewater and related matters. 
</P>
<P>
 Fiske, appointed Jan. 20 by Atty. Gen. Janet Reno, is looking into -- among 
other things -- whether McDougal improperly diverted funds from Madison 
Guaranty Savings & Loan Assn., which he controlled, to Whitewater and Clinton 
gubernatorial campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
 Clark said the firm has kept documents, "in anticipation they will be 
requested."

DRUG COMBINATION FOUND EFFECTIVE ON PEPTIC ULCERS; MEDICINE: A BACTERIUM LINKED 
TO THE MALADY CAN BE KILLED BY ANTIBIOTICS AND ACID-SUPPRESSING COMPOUNDS, A 
FEDERAL ADVISORY PANEL SAYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Peptic ulcers can be treated effectively with a recently discovered 
combination of antibiotics and traditional acid-suppressing drugs, a federal 
advisory panel concluded Wednesday, giving new hope to the estimated 25 million 
Americans afflicted by the disease. 
</P>
<P>
 The combination drug treatment can eradicate the bacterium Helicobacter pylori 
, reducing the rate of recurrence of peptic ulcers in up to 90% of patients, a 
panel of medical experts convened by the National Institutes of Health found. 
H. pylori was discovered in 1982 and researchers have since established a 
strong association between its presence and the development of one kind of 
peptic ulcer. 
</P>
<P>
 Peptic ulcer disease is a chronic inflammation of the stomach and duodenum, 
the place where the stomach joins the small intestine. Typically, it is not 
life-threatening but can result in substantial suffering and economic burden. 
It affects as much as 10% of the U.S. population at any given time. 
</P>
<P>
 Historically, such ulcers were thought to be related to stress and diet. 
Treatment focused on bland foods, bed rest and -- in severe cases -- 
hospitalization. Later, as scientific speculation about the cause of ulcers 
centered on digestive secretions such as gastric acid, the use of acid-reducing 
drugs known as H2 blockers became an important element in treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 Twelve years ago, a 32-year-old resident in internal medicine sought to turn 
those beliefs upside down with his discovery of a link between H. pylori and 
ulcers. 
</P>
<P>
 But instead of hailing Australian doctor Barry J. Marshall's findings as a 
breakthrough, the medical Establishment challenged them at nearly every turn 
because they overturned deeply held medical beliefs about the cause of ulcers. 
The medical panel's conclusions Wednesday serve as a final validation of 
Marshall's discovery. 
</P>
<P>
 Peptic ulcers are those that strike the gastrointestinal tract. Not everyone 
infected with the organism develops ulcers, and individuals can develop peptic 
ulcers without harboring the bacterium, scientists believe. The committee 
stressed that the therapy should be used only in those patients who test 
positive for the organism and who suffer from ulcer symptoms. 
</P>
<P>
 Although traditional therapy has been effective in reducing or eliminating 
individual ulcers, the problem has tended to recur because, scientists long 
believed, ulcer-prone individuals were particularly vulnerable to the stress 
and other factors in which the malady was thought to be rooted. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, recent research has shown that dual and triple combinations of 
bismuth, an acid-reducing compound; antibiotics, and antimicrobial drugs can 
successfully cure the H . pylori infection and reduce the rate of ulcer 
recurrence, the panel said. 
</P>
<P>
 The most effective triple-drug therapies include bismuth and the antibiotics 
tetracycline and metronidazole, the group said. In some cases, resistance to 
metronidazole could require a substitution of amoxicillin, the panel said. The 
committee recommended that the drugs be administered for two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "While mild side effects occur in each drug combination, they do not normally 
prevent patients from completing their therapy," said Dr. Tadataka Yamada, 
chairman of the panel. Tadataka heads the department of internal medicine at 
the University of Michigan Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 The panel also found a strong link between the bacterium and other upper 
gastrointestinal diseases, including gastritis, an inflammation of the stomach 
lining that also can be cured by eliminating the organism. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, the panel said infection with the bacterium should be considered a 
risk factor for gastric cancer. But the committee found no evidence that 
treating the infection reduces the risk. 
</P>
<P>
 Gastric cancer is rare in the United States but extremely common in many parts 
of the world. 
</P>
<P>
 There are several tests for the bacterium, including blood tests and a breath 
test that measures levels of the enzyme urease. Elevated levels usually 
indicate the presence of H. pylori.

CUTS IN HEALTH PLAN SOUGHT AFTER BIG DEFICIT PREDICTION; INSURANCE: WHITE HOUSE 
AND REFORM BACKERS REACT TO BUDGET OFFICE ESTIMATES. UNIVERSAL COVERAGE TARGET 
DATE MAY BE DELAYED PAST 1998. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration and its Capitol Hill allies began searching 
Wednesday for ways to trim the cost of the President's health reform plan, 
which the Congressional Budget Office says will add $74 billion to the federal 
deficit by the year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
 Possible targets include several costly new programs proposed by Clinton: 
coverage of long-term care, prescription drugs and mental health treatments, 
and federal payment of early retirees' health insurance premiums, 
Administration and congressional sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 The pressure to cut costs could delay the target date for providing all 
Americans with guaranteed insurance coverage. The President proposed 1998 as 
the deadline for attaining universal coverage and White House aides have not 
yet backed away from that target. But they also are not ruling out the 
possibility of a longer phase-in period. 
</P>
<P>
 Also under discussion is the possibility of scaling back a proposal to make 
all but the largest employers join quasi-public health alliances that would 
purchase insurance on their behalf. By making participation in the alliances 
more voluntary, the Administration might be able to refute the CBO's 
characterization of them as virtually government "agents," analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
 No decisions have been made and the Administration at this point appears more 
inclined to work in concert with congressional committees than to redesign the 
President's 1,342-page plan by itself, senior Administration officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not going to rewrite the President's plan because of the CBO," said one 
senior Clinton adviser. "It's more a process of working it out on the Hill." 
</P>
<P>
 On Capitol Hill, many lawmakers suggested that bringing Clinton's bill in line 
with the CBO's deficit projections would not be difficult. Even CBO Director 
Robert D. Reischauer agreed that the projected shortfall could be offset. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a number of things that could be done. The differences between the 
Administration's numbers and ours are not large relative to the menu of 
options," Reischauer told the Senate Finance Committee during a second day of 
congressional testimony. 
</P>
<P>
 On the one hand, the Administration clearly must respond to the CBO's 
critique, particularly the issue of deficit reduction. 
</P>
<P>
 As the President acknowledged during a White House photo session: "Those are 
all things that we can work out. Those are relatively minor budgetary 
considerations and other things that we can work through to get our numbers in 
harmony with theirs. So I'm not at all concerned." 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, any effort to lower the Clinton plan's total cost probably 
means scaling back major elements cherished by influential interest groups, 
including the American Assn. of Retired Persons, labor unions, consumer groups 
and the auto industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Elements of the proposed benefits package that would be guaranteed to every 
American are being reconsidered because the CBO ruled that the Administration 
has underestimated the cost of insurance premiums under its plan by 15%. If the 
CBO is correct, that would mean that the government would wind up paying more 
than the White House has estimated to provide subsidies for low-income workers 
and small employers. The additional costs would add $25 billion to the deficit 
between 1995 and the year 2000, the CBO estimated. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of trimming or eliminating specific benefits, the Administration could 
reduce outlays for subsidies by lowering the minimum amount that employers must 
pay on behalf of their workers, analysts said. Clinton's plan, as written, 
would require employers to pay 80% of an employee's premiums, with the worker 
paying the rest. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those things are negotiable," said one top Administration health adviser. 
"But if you go down to 50-50, we'd say no. We picked 80-20 because that's what 
most people have."

 Soil, shoes and other debris pulled from the burned rubble of David Koresh's 
Branch Davidian compound showed traces of flammable liquids, such as gasoline 
and kerosene, a chemist testified Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The testimony bolstered the government's contention that members of the 
religious group started the inferno that ended their 51-day standoff with 
federal agents. 
</P>
<P>
 Eleven Davidians are charged in the deaths of four federal agents killed in 
the Feb. 28, 1993, shootout that precipitated the siege. Six Davidians are 
believed to have died in the gun battle. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Andrew Armstrong, a chemist, testified that tear gas pumped into the 
compound by the FBI did not spark the flames. 
</P>
<P>
 Armstrong specializes in identifying liquids from suspicious fires.

TEEN CHARGED IN BOWLING BALL DEATH 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A teen-ager was charged Wednesday in the death of a baby girl who was hit in 
the head by a bowling ball that bounced through the windshield of her family's 
car after being dropped from a highway overpass. 
</P>
<P>
 Calvin Settle, 18, was charged with criminal homicide after reportedly telling 
police he placed the ball on the top of the railing. 
</P>
<P>
 Eight-month-old Natalia Rivera was struck Sunday by a 16-pound bowling ball 
etched with the name "Mike." She died Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The ball apparently bounced in front of a truck, glanced off the truck's 
bumper, flew across the highway divider and went through the windshield of the 
car. 
</P>
<P>
 "The baby died right before this poor couple's eyes," a police officer said. 
"It's tragic that people do these things." 
</P>
<P>
 The officer said Santos Rivera, a 43-year-old psychologist, and his wife, 
Donna, a 41-year-old psychotherapist, did not realize that the ball had struck 
their daughter, who was strapped into a child seat, until they pulled the car 
over and looked in the back seat.

BLACKMUN LIFTS BAN ON CBS TAPE OF TAINTED MEAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID G. SAVAGE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Supreme Court Justice Harry A. Blackmun on Wednesday lifted a state court 
order forbidding broadcast of an unauthorized videotape, allowing CBS News to 
go ahead with its hidden-camera news report showing tainted meat at a South 
Dakota packing plant. 
</P>
<P>
 Acting hours before the program "48 Hours" was scheduled to go on the air, 
Blackmun stressed that the First Amendment bars judges from blocking the media 
from reporting the news. 
</P>
<P>
 "For many years, it has been clearly established that any prior restraint on 
expression comes to this court with a heavy presumption against its 
constitutional validity," he wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 But those past high court pronouncements did not stop a South Dakota judge or 
the state Supreme Court from ordering CBS not to air the program. 
</P>
<P>
 "The economy of western South Dakota would be severely damaged" if the network 
broadcast excerpts from the videotape, which included scenes of fecal matter on 
cut pieces of meat, Judge Jeff W. Davis said in a Jan. 25 order. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, the state Supreme Court upheld the judge's order. 
</P>
<P>
 CBS filed an emergency appeal with Blackmun, who reviews such requests from 
the states of the upper Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
 CBS reporters had obtained a secret videotape from an employee at the Rapid 
City plant. Portions of the videotape were to air Wednesday night as part of a 
segment on contaminated beef. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyers for CBS noted that the company, Federal Beef Processing Inc., was 
tagged with more than 600 citations last year for violating U.S. Agriculture 
Department regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 "The sanitary quality of the meat we eat every day in restaurants and 
fast-food stores is a matter of surpassing national interest," the network 
maintained. 
</P>
<P>
 Company lawyers said the dispute did not involve the First Amendment, but 
rather "the illegal obtaining of a videotape." 
</P>
<P>
 "Far from being a prior restraint on free speech, this case involves the 
taking of trade secrets by CBS, the photographing of the unique processes and 
methods" used by the firm to process its beef, an attorney for the company 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis agreed with the company's arguments.

HUNDREDS FLEE FLOODING IN WEST VIRGINIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hundreds of people fled homes along swollen streams Wednesday after more than 
four inches of rain fell across parts of West Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
 High water also blocked dozens of roads, closed schools and businesses in 
several counties and forced the rerouting of traffic on one interstate, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere, subzero temperatures and snow continued to plague much of the 
nation Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 It was 52 degrees below zero at Promise, S. D., in the north-central part of 
the state. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to rain, the storm that spread snow and ice from the Plains to the 
East Coast on Tuesday also hit West Virginia with ice that knocked out power to 
about 13,000 customers statewide. 
</P>
<P>
 Gov. Gaston Caperton ordered the National Guard to assist flood victims in 
Grantsville, Glenville and Philippi, and he declared a state of emergency in 
four counties that were hit hard by ice storms. He also sent state workers home 
early Wednesday because of icy roads. 
</P>
<P>
 In northern West Virginia, about 1,000 people were asked to leave their homes 
along an eight-mile stretch of the Cheat River from St. George to Hendricks. 
High water had already entered many of the homes, firefighter Eric McCrum said. 
</P>
<P>
 Homes also were evacuated in seven other counties in western and eastern parts 
of the state. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cheat River crested nearly six feet above flood stage at Parsons and more 
than 10 feet above flood stage at Rowlesburg, the National Weather Service 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
 Lows of 30 below zero or colder were common across the northern Plains, with 
record lows of 47 below at Redfield, S. D.; 43 below at Bismarck, N. D., and 31 
below at Valentine, Neb. 
</P>
<P>
 Snow fell at Buffalo, N. Y., the 54th consecutive day of a trace or more of 
precipitation, beginning Dec. 18. The previous record of 53 consecutive days 
was in the winter of 1976-77. 
</P>
<P>
 Streets and sidewalks in Delaware were so icy Wednesday that several post 
offices halted mail deliveries. "It just wasn't worth the risk because it's 
really treacherous," said postal clerk Jim Cooke at the Camden-Wyoming Post 
Office. 
</P>
<P>
 Snowfall totals included a foot in Wisconsin, 10 inches along the Connecticut 
shoreline and more than seven inches in Rhode Island. 
</P>
<P>
 Many cities and towns throughout the Northeast have already exhausted their 
annual snow-removal budgets.

 Under pressure to reduce accidents in the nation's growing regional airline 
industry, the Federal Aviation Administration announced that commuter pilots 
will be required to undergo the same training as captains of jetliners.The FAA 
plans to have the proposed standards ready by this summer, officials said. 
Commuter pilots are currently required to pass regular proficiency tests, but 
the FAA has no formal standards for their training programs. Among other 
things, the new FAA standards could require more training on flight simulators 
and in working with fellow crew members, agency officials said.

 Connecticut's three-year-old income tax has boosted the state's revenues so 
much that Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. proposed eliminating property taxes within 
10 years. The proposal would save $700 million a year for taxpayers in 
Connecticut, where property taxes are among the highest in the United States.In 
his State of the State Address in Hartford, Weicker said cities and towns would 
be reimbursed from state funds for income lost through elimination of the 
property tax. The proposal's chance of passing the Legislature is unclear. 
Weicker's speech came a day after the U.S. Census Bureau said three of the top 
10 fastest-shrinking cities in the nation are in Connecticut. Economists said 
people are leaving because of poor job opportunities and high taxes.

WILSON, OTHERS DECLARE INTENT TO SEEK OFFICES

<TEXT>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson has filed documents declaring his intent to run for 
reelection, meeting Wednesday's state deadline to file with the secretary of 
state. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those also filing for governor were Democrats John Garamendi, the state 
insurance commissioner, state Treasurer Kathleen Brown and state Sen. Tom 
Hayden. 
</P>
<P>
 The declarations were incomplete, because potential candidates for a variety 
of state offices could declare their intent to run with the secretary of 
state's office in Sacramento, as Wilson did, or make a similar filing at the 
county level. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, there is no incumbent running in six statewide races, so the 
filing deadline for those offices is not until Monday. Those six offices are 
lieutenant governor, controller, treasurer, secretary of state, superintendent 
of public instruction and insurance commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
 Caren Daniels-Meade, spokeswoman for Secretary of State March Fong Eu, said a 
complete list of candidates will not be available until next week. 
</P>
<P>
 Under state law, candidates must declare their intent to seek office. They 
have 30 days after that deadline to officially file as candidates for office. 
</P>
<P>
 Others who declared their intent to run were Assemblyman Stan Statham (R-Oak 
Run), who filed for the GOP nomination for lieutenant governor to replace 
Democrat Leo T. McCarthy, who is retiring. Filing on the Democratic side was 
Controller Gray Davis. 
</P>
<P>
 In a suprise move, state Sen. David A. Roberti (D-Van Nuys) filed for both 
state treasurer and a seat on the Board of Equalization, Daniels said. This 
buys Roberti more time to make up his mind which office to run for. 
</P>
<P>
 Former State Democratic Party Chairman Phil Angelides also filed papers to run 
for treasurer. 
</P>
<P>
 Chief Deputy Secretary of State Tony Miller filed to run for the Democratic 
nomination to replace his boss, who has been nominated by President Clinton to 
be U.S. ambassador to Micronesia. Assemblyman Bill Jones (R-Fresno) and 
Assemblywoman Gwen Moore (D-Los Angeles) also filed for the office. 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblyman Rusty Areias (D-San Jose) filed for the Democratic nomination for 
state controller to replace incumbent Democrat Gray Davis, who is expected to 
run for lieutenant governor. Former GOP Assemblyman Tom McClintock of Thousand 
Oaks also filed for the post, as did Democrat Kathleen Connell. 
</P>
<P>
 State Sen. Art Torres (D-Los Angeles) filed to seek office as state insurance 
commissioner, the job Garamendi is leaving. So did Republican Jim Conran. 
</P>
<P>
 Gov. Wilson's education adviser, Maureen DiMarco, filed for the nonpartisan 
office of state superintendent of public instruction. Assemblywoman Delaine 
Eastin (D-Fremont), the chairwoman of the Assembly Education Committee, also 
filed for the state schools post. 
</P>
<P>
 In the attorney general's race, incumbent Republican Dan Lungren filed for 
reelection.

REPORTER'S NOTEBOOK; BROWN UNRUFFLED BY HAYDEN SURPRISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY WALLACE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 State Treasurer Kathleen Brown gained a potential rival Wednesday, but as she 
completed a two-day, seven-city tour of the state, the name Tom Hayden rarely 
passed her lips. 
</P>
<P>
 In Santa Barbara, where Brown shook hands at an electronics firm that trains 
high-skill workers, she responded to a query about the well-known state 
senator's unexpected gubernatorial ambitions by predicting, "This is going to 
be an exciting Democratic primary race." 
</P>
<P>
 In Fresno, where Brown stumped in front of the county juvenile hall, a similar 
question prompted this response: "It's a wonderful country and state that we 
live in." She said she would stick to her chosen issues, jobs, crime and 
education, "no matter who else joins the race." 
</P>
<P>
 The official campaign position was clear: It will take more than a third 
Democratic would-be governor to knock Brown off her mark. Just to be safe, 
though, she wasn't giving Hayden any free press by repeating his name in 
public. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In 30 hours, Brown had delivered and redelivered a single speech seven times. 
On the campaign jet, she gave reporters an idea of what such repetition can do 
to a candidate by grimacing and crossing her eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who had followed her around from Sacramento to San Diego and several 
stops in between understood what she meant. In all, she had belted out her 
speech's tailored-for-TV slogan, "Enough is enough," more than 50 times, shaken 
countless outstretched hands, autographed scads of campaign posters and fielded 
questions about everything from the death penalty to the color of her suit. 
</P>
<P>
 So why, after such a backbreaking schedule, was Brown still smiling? Michael 
Reese, her spokesman, ventured a guess: "With satellite feeds, we've hit all 
the media markets in the state. Not bad for two days work." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Reporters weren't the only people in the crowd. From Burbank to Santa Barbara, 
Brown was greeted by admirers, many of them women. 
</P>
<P>
 Stephanie Priest, an electronics worker in Santa Barbara, wore a vintage 
campaign button from one of Brown's father's bids for governor -- "Pat Brown 
for me," it said. Kathleen Brown had impressed her, she said, and the fact that 
she is a woman was an added plus. 
</P>
<P>
 "My job is very male-oriented. So is politics," said Priest, whose female 
colleagues nodded in agreement. "But she's a mother, she's a wife. She sees 
what we see." 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier in Sacramento, another group of women beamed approval at Brown -- but 
these were faces she knew. The foursome, who had traveled from New York, Aspen 
and Ojai to be by the candidate's side, are among Brown's best friends -- a 
tightknit group who call themselves the Meter Maids. 
</P>
<P>
 The nickname, said Meredith Brokaw, the wife of "NBC Nightly News" anchor Tom 
Brokaw, dates back to when they all lived in New York City and played tennis 
almost every morning before work. The custodian of the courts, mystified by 
their early schedules, asked if they were meter maids. The name stuck, and so 
did the friendships. 
</P>
<P>
 When Brown was inaugurated as treasurer, Brokaw said, the Meter Maids were 
there to witness it. There's no way they would miss the beginning of her 
gubernatorial bid. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been through our children's crises, our husbands' crises and through 
our own. We've also shared the joy," Brown said later, remembering the Sunday 
night potluck dinners and annual Easter egg hunts the women shared. "We've 
always been there for each other." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Being there for each other was a theme repeated throughout the two-day junket. 
Van Gordon Sauter, an executive at Fox Television and Brown's husband, spent 
the first day on the campaign trail, as did several others, including her 
mother Bernice. The candidate's twin grandchildren, Brendan and Katherine, were 
trotted out on the first stop Tuesday -- a ploy Brown later admitted she had 
found "shameless" when her father did it. Now, she explained, it had suddenly 
become "irresistible." 
</P>
<P>
 Not surprisingly, the state Republican Party attempted to use her family ties 
against her by distributing leaflets at one stop that compared her to her 
controversial brother, Jerry, the last Democrat to serve as governor. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown was unfazed. "This is going to be a race between Pete Wilson and 
Kathleen Brown," she said, artfully omitting the name of Insurance Commissioner 
John Garamendi, the man she hopes to beat in the June 7 primary. 
</P>
<P>
 Voters, she said, "are not voting for my brother. They're not voting for my 
father, or for my husband or even my grandchildren." In the future, she said, 
she hopes the Republicans will use better photographs on their leaflets. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would love it if they'd use a family picture," she said. "It's a great 
family. Just use a good picture and I'd like the grandchildren up front."

UCI FLUTIST SEASONS THE DANCE MIX WITH SCORE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL KOHLHAASE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Last spring, choreographer Donald McKayle heard some taped sketches of 
electronic music that flutist James Newton, a fellow member of the UC Irvine 
faculty, had been working on. The next thing Newton knew, McKayle was asking 
him to compose the music for "Gumbo Ya-Ya," a ballet for which McKayle had been 
commissioned by the Kennedy Center in Washington. The work is being presented 
in San Francisco tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 "It all moved very rapidly," Newton recalled this week. "I had heard McKayle's 
name for years and knew he was one of the most respected American 
choreographers. When you see his work, you understand why. He is able to 
combine power and sensitivity at the same time. It's a composer's dream: Each 
phrase (of music) can be gift-wrapped in the different movements and 
expressions he creates. Often, there can be a huge gulf between the music and 
the choreography, but there can be real integration with his work." 
</P>
<P>
 Newton has garnered his own share of respect. Known worldwide as a 
scintillating musician who explores both the tradition of jazz and its outer 
realms, he has won Downbeat magazine's readers' and international critics' 
polls as best flutist 11 years running. 
</P>
<P>
 His reputation as a composer is burgeoning not only in jazz, but also in the 
European tradition. 
</P>
<P>
 His 1985 release "The African Flower," a reworking of music by Duke Ellington 
and Billy Strayhorn, was Downbeat's album of the year. A forthcoming release on 
the AudioQuest Music label (based in San Clemente) will feature Newton's 
four-part suite for jazz ensemble written to honor the late Mexican artist 
Frida Kahlo, a piece commissioned by the Los Angeles Cultural Affairs 
Department in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, his "Lake of Resolution" for flute and chamber orchestra has been 
played by Vladimir Spivakov and the Moscow Virtuosi, and his "Line of 
Immortality" was premiered by the San Francisco Contemporary Chamber Players in 
1992. Newton currently is on a Guggenheim grant to write his first symphony, 
set to premier in Germany in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 "Gumbo Ya-Ya" is the first dance piece Newton has written. "When working on 
this music," he said, "I thought a lot about movement, about the dancing I saw 
in the church as a child when I spent time in the South, and about the African 
tradition of dance. The thing I was interested in was putting the rhythm 
first." 
</P>
<P>
 "Gumbo" is a further break from Newton's earlier work in that it is the first 
electronic piece he has completed. Except for the flute, all the sounds are 
synthesized or sampled from strings, French horn and clarinet. 
</P>
<P>
 "Working on the computer is extremely liberating. If I want to utilize a 
pizzicato (plucked) string sound, I can have a whole orchestra doing it just 
the way I want," he said. "In this illusory world, it's not a problem to put a 
percussion ensemble together with the strings, or create any other scenario you 
can think of. In my head, I can imagine the string orchestra in a village in 
Senegal with a Senegalese percussion ensemble. In real life, that's very 
difficult. But in the electronic world, it's a possibility. 
</P>
<P>
 "My tastes are very broad and there are many different types of music I 
admire," Newton said. "With the computer, I can go from one to the other 
freely. I can use something African and African American and European and then 
work in Asian influences; no cultural walls exist to limit my expression. If I 
was working with an ensemble, they might be able to do some things well, but 
not others." 
</P>
<P>
 Newton found working with McKayle to be very rewarding. "He came up with the 
plot from sketches I gave him, then I went ahead and completed the music. He 
gave me a lot of freedom but he also let me know when things needed to be 
stronger. I just can't say enough about him. It was an honor to work with 
someone of his standing and dignity."

ASBESTOS RISK ADDS TO VICTIMS' TROUBLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MYRON LEVIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As president of an environmental testing firm, Michael Uziel usually deals 
with the toxic worries of others. But he's had serious ones of his own since 
last month's earthquake battered his Northridge home -- cracking the cottage 
cheese ceiling and scattering asbestos dust over furnishings and carpets. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's devastating . . . I have to throw (away) almost all my belongings," said 
Uziel, 50, who evacuated his house and may not have enough insurance to cover 
both structural repairs and asbestos cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
 Jolted by an asbestos aftershock, hundreds of building owners and occupants 
like Uziel are scrambling to deal with the risk of contamination from asbestos, 
a leading environmental cause of lung cancer, along with extra cleanup costs 
and delays in getting their lives back to normal. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of its widespread use in building materials, asbestos "is always an 
issue of concern whenever there's an event that damages structures," said 
Kathleen Shimman, regional director of the office of health and emergency 
planning for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. When earthquakes or 
hurricanes knock buildings around, asbestos "can be shredded and broken and . . 
. the fibers of asbestos can be inhaled." 
</P>
<P>
 In one form or another, asbestos is present in more than half of all buildings 
that are at least 15 years old, authorities say. And while many uses of 
asbestos have been banned, some continued into the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite its fearsome reputation, asbestos is perfectly safe when intact. But 
when asbestos materials are pulverized or broken, they can release microscopic 
fibers that float like water vapor and are dangerous to inhale. 
</P>
<P>
 Health officials and asbestos consultants have been flooded with calls from 
those concerned about the problem. But they said many other building owners and 
occupants probably are unaware of quake-related damage to asbestos materials. 
Meanwhile, some homeowners, unwilling or unable to hire licensed asbestos 
contractors, are cleaning up asbestos debris themselves -- with or without 
proper equipment and dust prevention methods. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, business is booming for the asbestos abatement industry, which is on 
a short list of businesses thriving in the wake of the Jan. 17 quake. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody in this industry -- consultant and contractor included -- have been 
taxed and maximized to the extent of capacity and beyond to cover all . . . 
work that's going on," said Thomas A. Jordan, vice president of Gale/Jordan 
Associates Inc., an environmental consulting firm. 
</P>
<P>
 Although asbestos is typically out of sight in boiler rooms or attics, the 
quake showed how pervasive it is. In a number of large office buildings, 
asbestos fireproofing from steel beams floated down through dislodged ceiling 
tiles to settle on floors and desks, Jordan said. In several offices where his 
firm ran air tests, Jordan said these spills temporarily created significant 
airborne levels of asbestos. 
</P>
<P>
 Other consultants and contractors said they also have been busy cleaning 
commercial buildings the quake left structurally sound but littered with 
asbestos. Typically, such cleanups involve misting the air to weigh down 
floating asbestos dust, wet-wiping solid surfaces, and using special vacuum 
cleaners with dense filters to capture the microscopic fibers -- which are so 
tiny they pass through the bag of an ordinary vacuum. 
</P>
<P>
 But Jordan voiced concern that other building managers -- overjoyed their 
structures were left standing -- didn't think to visually check asbestos 
materials for cracks and tears. 
</P>
<P>
 "In my opinion, there's a lot of buildings out there that have asbestos in 
them that had significant fiber release, but because they didn't have extensive 
structural damage they (the owners) are not aware of it," Jordan said. 
</P>
<P>
 The quake and its aftershocks also triggered asbestos spills at about 100 
schools in the Los Angeles Unified School District. Richard F. Henry, the 
district's asbestos technical supervisor, said that in preparing the schools 
for the return of students and staff, cleanup crews had to remove fallen 
asbestos soundproofing and pipe wrap and broken asbestos floor tile. 
</P>
<P>
 In some areas, the problem has defied a quick fix. For example, in the little 
theater area at El Camino Real High School in Woodland Hills, asbestos debris 
from broken acoustical material is so extensive that the area has been 
temporarily sealed pending further work, Henry said. 
</P>
<P>
 At Cal State Northridge, pulverized asbestos littered so much of the 
engineering building that officials were forced to order a massive cleanup 
before they could get in to assess quake damage, said Bill Chatham, CSUN 
associate vice president for facilities and operations. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, with the cleanup nearly complete after 10 days of wiping and vaccuuming 
asbestos debris, the big aftershock of Saturday, Jan. 29, created a second 
asbestos blizzard. Said Chatham: "They were wrapping up and getting ready to 
shut down operations, and Saturday it's full go again." 
</P>
<P>
 Many houses and apartments have problems of their own -- including cottage 
cheese or "popcorn" ceilings that in some cases contain at least a small 
percentage of asbestos. In some cases, the earthquake cracked or shattered 
these ceilings, dusting carpets and furniture below. 
</P>
<P>
 That was the case at Michael Uziel's house, built in 1977, where asbestos was 
found not only in the ceiling but in plaster from cracked walls. Uziel, who has 
two children, moved out, and alerted neighbors with homes of similar 
construction. 
</P>
<P>
 A couple of the neighbors also moved out, but some "just shrugged it off," 
Uziel said -- taking the view that "if it doesn't bite, and doesn't burn, it 
doesn't hurt you." 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew my responsibility to other people," he said. "Sometimes you happen to 
know things that the average man doesn't." 
</P>
<P>
 What Uziel does not know, however, is how he will take care of structural 
repair and cleanup costs well in excess of his $100,000 earthquake insurance 
policy. 
</P>
<P>
 Asbestos insulation on ductwork has been another trouble area in single homes. 
When Jeff Prey called a private building inspector to the attic of his West 
Hills home to check on fallen roof beams, the inspector also found split 
ductwork and asbestos insulation -- raising a risk of asbestos fibers swirling 
through the ducts with each aftershock or wind gust through the vents. That, 
and the fact that Prey's 3-year-old sleeps next to the attic, was enough to 
send him packing. 
</P>
<P>
 Long considered a leading environmental cause of lung cancer, asbestos also 
has been linked to mesothelioma, a rare and nearly always fatal cancer that may 
appear up to 40 years after initial exposure. 
</P>
<P>
 Low levels of asbestos are always present in the air, due to construction and 
demolition work and erosion from brake linings and clutches. The vast bulk of 
asbestos disease has afflicted heavily exposed workers who labored for years in 
dusty conditions with minimal protection. But asbestos illness occasionally is 
reported in people thought to have been minimally exposed, prompting many 
experts to say no level is safe to breathe. 
</P>
<P>
 When homeowners discover crumbling insulation or building fixtures, there 
usually is no way to know for sure if it contains asbestos without a laboratory 
test. 
</P>
<P>
 If broken asbestos is present in more than minimal amounts, most experts 
advise homeowners to hire a licensed asbestos abatement contractor rather than 
attempt the work themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, experts say consumers should be on the lookout for price-gougers and 
shoddy work -- which by scattering asbestos can do more harm than good. 
</P>
<P>
 Dean Stratton, an official with Environ, an abatement firm with offices in Van 
Nuys and Hermosa Beach, said some contractors are charging a premium of 25% 
above their normal rates. "People are desperate to get it (the work) done, and 
it may be weeks before they can get it taken care of by the company that gave 
them the best price," Stratton said. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, consumers should compare bids from at least three contractors and check 
the license status before hiring a contractor, said Diane Lickar, who runs an 
asbestos abatement firm and is president of the Environmental Information 
Assn., a trade group that provides referrals to asbestos consultants, 
contractors and labs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have to tell you there are a lot of unethical contractors," Lickar said. 
"The worst come out at times like this." 
</P>
<P>
 Owners of commercial and apartment buildings are required to hire licensed 
contractors to perform asbestos abatement work. But homeowners are exempt from 
this requirement, and in some cases are doing cleanup and removal themselves -- 
although most experts caution against it. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County health officials and the American Lung Assn. are responding 
to questions on doing simple asbestos cleanups. "Usually people lack the funds 
to (hire a contractor) so we would tell them how to get literature to properly 
clean up asbestos," said Don Thompson, an industrial hygienist with the 
county's health/hazardous materials control program. 
</P>
<P>
 Regulations designed to limit asbestos dust in outdoor air have also been 
relaxed to speed clearance of quake rubble. 
</P>
<P>
 In normal times, the federal Clean Air Act and South Coast Air Quality 
Management District rules require special precautions to keep asbestos from 
becoming airborne during building repairs or demolition. The rules require 
asbestos contractors to wet down and gently remove the asbestos before 
demolition occurs. 
</P>
<P>
 But many quake-damaged buildings are too unstable for asbestos crews to enter 
-- and thus are being cleared with the minimal safeguard of wetting the rubble 
to reduce dust. This also means that rubble containing at least small amounts 
of asbestos is going to area landfills that normally don't accept it. 
</P>
<P>
 Said air district spokesman Bill Kelly: "You have to make a trade-off between 
the problem of asbestos and the imminent public safety concern from these 
unstable structures." Asbestos Fallout 
</P>
<P>
 Fallout from the Northridge earthquake can include contamination by asbestos, 
a substance used in many building products and a leading environmental cause of 
cancer. Although many asbestos uses have been banned, even structures built 
after 1980 may contain the substance. Asbestos materials are safe when intact, 
but -- when torn or broken -- may release harmful fibers into the air. 
</P>
<P>
 * INDICATIONS 
</P>
<P>
 Broken or crumbling fireproofing, acoustical insulation, pipe wrapping, floor 
tiles or ceiling material. 
</P>
<P>
 * TESTS 
</P>
<P>
 There usually is no way to know for sure if material contains asbestos without 
a microscopic analysis. Laboratories charge as little as $15 per sample to test 
suspect materials, although a full home inspection -- including sampling, lab 
results and a written report -- could cost $200. 
</P>
<P>
 * CLEANUP OR REMOVAL 
</P>
<P>
 When damaged asbestos material is present in more than minimal amounts, most 
authorities advise homeowners to hire a licensed asbestos abatement contractor 
to clean up or remove the material rather than attempt the work themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts say consumers should be on the lookout for price-gouging and slipshod 
work -- which could scatter asbestos and do more harm than good. Consumers 
should compare bids from at least three contractors. 
</P>
<P>
 Before hiring an asbestos abatement contractor, check the firm's license 
status and complaint history with the Contractors State License Board, which 
has regional offices in Glendale (818-543-4735) and Buena Park (714-994-7450). 
Also, ask the contractor to show a current certificate of registration for 
asbestos-related work, issued by the state Division of Occupational Safety and 
Health. 
</P>
<P>
 * GETTING ADVICE 
</P>
<P>
 There are several sources of free advice on testing suspected 
asbestos-containing material, cleaning up minor asbestos spills, and finding 
qualified asbestos laboratories and contractors. Among them: 
</P>
<P>
 * Los Angeles County Department of Health Services, (213) 725-5055. 
</P>
<P>
 * American Lung Assn., (818) 797-LUNG or (213) 935-LUNG. The Lung Assn. also 
offers a useful booklet, "Asbestos in Your Home." 
</P>
<P>
 * The Environmental Information Assn., whose members include asbestos, lead 
and radon consultants, and abatement contractors, also refers consumers to 
licensed asbestos firms. (310) 594-6316.

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: CALABASAS, AGOURA; SCHOOLS WEIGH NEW SECURITY MEASURES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KURT PITZER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the wake of two recent attacks on students in nearby districts, Las 
Virgenes Unified School District officials are considering new security 
measures and urging students to report rumors of violence. 
</P>
<P>
 The Las Virgenes school board Monday directed its staff to determine the costs 
of purchasing hand-held radios, and installing fences and security equipment at 
Agoura and Calabasas high schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the safety measures have been under consideration for months, they 
are "more relevant" now, Assistant Supt. Donald Zimring said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are getting more and more concerned as we watch what is happening in 
schools in surrounding communities," he said. "And we want to do something in 
order to be proactive instead of reactive." 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, a student was stabbed to death by a classmate at Valley View Junior 
High in Simi Valley, and three Westlake High School students were injured when 
someone started shooting into a crowd that had gathered to watch a fight in 
Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Those incidents prompted parents and school officials to meet Monday in Agoura 
Hills and Wednesday in Calabasas to discuss school safety. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're telling parents that their communication with their kids and their 
kids' communication with us is essential to safety," Agoura High Principal Jim 
Christianson said. "With these other incidents, kids knew what was going on, 
but didn't tell the people who could stop it." 
</P>
<P>
 Christianson said he hopes that parents and students will begin to use a crime 
tip hot line set up last spring in Calabasas and expanded last month to include 
Agoura Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Callers to the toll-free phone number -- (800) SPEEK-UP -- may leave anonymous 
tips about crimes or suspicious activity on an answering machine monitored by 
the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department's Juvenile Intervention Team, 
Sheriff's Lt. James Pierson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of time, kids are reluctant to give their names and would prefer to 
leave information on an answering machine," Pierson said. "This is a way for us 
to get information before something happens, like a fight on campus, so we can 
get there first." 
</P>
<P>
 Although only a few tips have been left, most of which were too vague to be 
useful, Pierson said, "it's good to have it available just in case." KURT

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: ENCINO; OLDER HOUSING TRACT RIDES OUT QUAKE IN STYLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEANNETTE REGALADO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 They sure don't build them like they used to, declared Howard Grover, an 
original resident of an Encino housing tract that was one of the first in the 
San Fernando Valley. And considering how well the neighborhood held up in the 
Jan. 17 quake, for once it wasn't a cliche. 
</P>
<P>
 "This old frame house rode it out beautifully," said Grover, who bought the 
first home on Burma Street in 1949. 
</P>
<P>
 The tract was originally built for servicemen coming home from World War II, 
and Grover, fresh out of the Army, paid $8,000 for the two-bedroom, 
one-bathroom house. He and his wife, Joyce, moved in before the streets were 
paved and fences were put up. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple -- he is 73, she is 67 -- have ridden out several powerful 
earthquakes. And although dishes broke and hairline cracks resurfaced in the 
most recent one, "when you looked closely, there was no damage." 
</P>
<P>
 The appearance of the wood and stucco houses has changed over the years, but 
the 42 homes on Burma Street suffered only superficial damage from the temblor. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it is designed well, then they have a better chance with earthquakes," 
said Roger Bray of William M. Bray Architect and Associates in Encino. "With 
good design, engineering and construction, they can withstand the test of 
time." 
</P>
<P>
 When the Grovers moved in, "everyone was a GI and newly married. At one time 
we had 17 pregnant wives living here," said Grover, who raised three children 
of his own in the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the years, a core of longtime residents have organized networking 
and emergency groups to inform neighbors of upcoming community events. 
</P>
<P>
 Estheranne Billings moved into the neighborhood in 1954. According to 
Billings, the area was originally called Encino Park and is bounded by Burbank 
Boulevard to the south, Lindley Avenue to the west, Oxnard Street to the north 
and Louise Avenue to the east. 
</P>
<P>
 Billings, president of the Encino Park Improvement Committee, said most of the 
homes still have their original hardwood floors, steel casement windows, 
porcelain sinks and stainless steel countertops. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole thing really surprised me, considering the magnitude of the 
earthquake," Billings said. "There really isn't anything you could buy today 
that has the quality of these homes." 
</P>
<P>
 When the earthquake hit, the residents were careful to check on each other, 
Grover said.  
</P>
<P>
 "I saw people you never saw before," said Grover. "We are among the older ones 
here now, but we made new friends." 
</P>
<P>
 One person the neighbors worried about is 77-year-old Gussene Hatzik. She 
moved into the neighborhood with her husband in 1952 and has been widowed since 
1970. Alone during the earthquake, Hatzik stayed in her bed until neighbors 
came to check on her. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am lucky," said Hatzik. "The way it shook, I thought the whole thing was 
going to fall. But the roof, which is the original, stood up wonderfully. I 
don't have to worry about anything falling off or cracking here." JEANNETTE

GLENDALE / BURBANK: BURBANK; TEMPORARY SIGNS OKD BY CITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ED BOND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Burbank City Council has voted to allow businesses to erect temporary 
signs for promotional events. 
</P>
<P>
 The move signals the end of two years of reform for the city's sign 
ordinances, which have never allowed temporary banners or signs. 
</P>
<P>
 Under an ordinance approved Tuesday night, business owners may put up the 
signs for a $35 fee. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council also approved a measure that bars anyone from putting up 
signs on private property without the owner's permission, an action that 
opponents said could affect future political campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Bob Bowne dissented in the 4-1 vote to approve the temporary sign 
permits, saying that the action would encourage too many signs, giving the city 
a "trashy" appearance while creating friction between businesses and city 
enforcement officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the new ordinance, businesses would be able to put up promotional signs 
twice during the year for no more than 14 days in each use.  
</P>
<P>
 Auto dealers would also be able to put up bunting for six months for the same 
$35 fee.  
</P>
<P>
 Businesses would also have to give the city a $120 deposit that would be 
forfeited if the signage or bunting did not come down in time. 
</P>
<P>
 By also prohibiting signs to be posted on private property without the owner's 
permission -- an action approved unanimously -- future political campaigns will 
be affected, and lesser-known candidates will have a harder time gaining 
exposure, said Councilman Dave Golonski. ED BOND

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: NORTH HOLLYWOOD; PANEL ELECTION SET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HUGO MARTIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles City Council has voted to hold an election on March 8 for 
members of a citizens advisory panel overseeing the North Hollywood 
Redevelopment Project. 
</P>
<P>
 The council Tuesday instructed the city clerk to spend no more than $8,000 to 
supervise the election of 14 of the 25 members of the panel, formally called 
the Project Area Committee.Each member serves a two-year term. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee advises the Community Redevelopment Agency on issues involving 
the redevelopment project. For years, pro- and anti-redevelopment factions have 
struggled to gain control of the committee. 
</P>
<P>
 The last committee election, in October, 1992, was called unfair and 
procedurally flawed by redevelopment critics after they failed to win a 
majority of the seats on the panel. The critics said the League of Women Voters 
-- which supervised the election -- allowed dozens of voters to cast ballots 
before all of the candidates had been nominated. That move, the critics said, 
might have deprived some candidates of votes. 
</P>
<P>
 "We followed the rules that were approved by the City Council," said Felita 
Waxman, a League of Women Voters representative who helped supervise the 
election.  
</P>
<P>
 Waxman defended the organization's actions and said the election had been very 
volatile. She said the league had not decided whether to participate in the 
March 8 polling. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman John Ferraro, who represents North Hollywood, said he hopes the 
participation of the city clerk in the election will eliminate a similar 
controversy. HUGO MARTIN

PEROT FOLLOWERS SEEK CANDIDATE TO CHALLENGE FOR BEILENSON'S JOB; CONGRESS: THEY 
HOPE TO RECRUIT A 'POLITICAL VIRGIN' TO RUN AS AN INDEPENDENT IN THE DISTRICT 
STRETCHING FROM SHERMAN OAKS TO THOUSAND OAKS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A group of political neophytes who were energized by Ross Perot's call to 
"take back their government" is trying to raise $4,000 to $5,000 to run just 
such a newspaper ad in the coming weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If you want a different kind of political candidate, they reasoned, you have 
to take an unconventional approach to finding one. 
</P>
<P>
 Faced with long odds, they hope to recruit a "political virgin" to run as an 
Independent for the congressional seat held by veteran Rep. Anthony C. 
Beilenson (D-Woodland Hills). The district, which extends from Sherman Oaks to 
Malibu and up to most of Thousand Oaks, was a hotbed of Perot support during 
the 1992 presidential campaign when he was a candidate. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to show that we are the people who hire our congressman," said Verne 
Balman, a Thousand Oaks businessman and one of the group's coordinators. "They 
tend to represent their parties or their own interests." 
</P>
<P>
 The mad-as-hell activists head a chapter of United We Stand America in the 
Conejo Valley. They run an office with individual contributions, staff it with 
volunteers and meet regularly to discuss their goals of reforming the federal 
government and slicing the budget deficit. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Perot himself appears diminished as a national force, these 
close-knit political outsiders intend to declare their independence by delving 
more deeply into the electoral arena. And, taking Perot at his word, they say: 
"We're the boss." 
</P>
<P>
 In the process, they face serious impediments as they attempt to mobilize 
support without Perot's direct involvement. The Texas tycoon has said that his 
nationwide organization will not endorse candidates for office -- a move that 
could jeopardize its tax-exempt status. 
</P>
<P>
 Balman said that local chapters are prohibited by Perot's headquarters in 
Dallas from even contacting the individuals in its area who have contributed 
$15 to join its ranks. The stated reason for the policy is to protect the 
members' privacy. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're a national organization who doesn't know its members," Balman said. 
"That's crazy." 
</P>
<P>
 The Thousand Oaks activists must also overcome their lack of political 
experience -- even if they regard this as a plus. And, while these business 
people, retirees, former teachers and postgraduates maintain that politicians 
of both parties are "bought and paid for" by big contributors, they still must 
raise enough money to make their candidate heard. 
</P>
<P>
 "We plan on doing it with people power," said Roger Smith, a Newbury Park 
political independent who says he is disgusted by the government's state of 
affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 They will need a lot of it. The Conejo Valley group is one of three Perot 
chapters in the 24th District. The two other United We Stand America chapters 
in the west San Fernando Valley and the mid-Valley appear inclined to support a 
Republican rather than join the Conejo Valley chapter's effort to find an 
Independent candidate, Balman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Beilenson, a resilient and resourceful campaigner, challenged the group's 
assertion that it represents even a majority of its own membership. He has met 
with the United We Stand America's members at length. 
</P>
<P>
 "No matter what happens, in my opinion, a lot of the Perot people will support 
me, whether they are Democrats or Republicans," Beilenson said. "Most of them 
are rational, thoughtful, sensible folks." He called the candidate-seekers 
"self-proclaimed arbiters of taste." 
</P>
<P>
 Robert K. Hammer, a Newbury Park investment banker and one of three 
Republicans seeking the GOP nomination, also claimed that he has wide support 
among those who find Perot's ideas appealing. 
</P>
<P>
 He expressed skepticism that the Perot backers would field a candidate this 
year. But, even if they do, he predicted that the impact would be minimal -- 
particularly since the Conejo Valley represents a minority of the San Fernando 
Valley-based district. 
</P>
<P>
 "There will be some splitting of the vote because there's Democrats and 
Republicans alike in that one slice of the Perot group," said Hammer. "I just 
don't think it's going to make a huge difference." 
</P>
<P>
 Nine Conejo Valley members who attended a recent meeting reflected a mix of 
registered Democrats, Republicans and Independents. The strongest commonality 
was alienation from the political and government process across-the-board. 
</P>
<P>
 Political analysts familiar with the district say that any serious showing by 
an independent candidate could help reelect Beilenson by siphoning off some 
voters who would be inclined to vote against him or against incumbents 
generally. 
</P>
<P>
 That would be ironic, since the Perotistas are especially angry with the 
nine-term lawmaker. They were upset when he voted for President Clinton's 
deficit-reduction plan and they were furious when he backed the North American 
Free Trade Agreement. Perot opposed both. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was no mistake about how the district felt," Balman, a lifelong 
Republican, said of Beilenson. "He's an employee. . . . Arrogant is the word we 
would tag on Tony." 
</P>
<P>
 Beilenson maintained that NAFTA would create jobs in the United States, expand 
U. S. exports to Mexico and help reduce illegal immigration. But he also said 
emphatically that Balman and his compatriots are wrong about the district's 
sentiments. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, "a majority of the communications we received on NAFTA were in 
support," Beilenson said. "But clearly that was an issue where those who 
opposed it were more adamant about it than those who were in favor. It's clear 
that if a poll were taken on it, that a large majority of people would support 
it. It's even more clear now that the vote is over." 
</P>
<P>
 Beilenson also chastised the Perot activists for failing to appreciate the 
impact of his vote on the Clinton budget plan. "It was the only viable effort 
that was available to cut the budget deficit," he said. "In fact, it will and 
it did." 
</P>
<P>
 Disillusioned with the Democratic incumbent, the Conejo Valley group 
interviewed the three active candidates for the Republican nomination. In 
addition to Hammer, they are Richard Sybert, a Woodland Hills attorney and 
ex-aide to Gov. Pete Wilson, and Mark Boos Benhard, an Agoura businessman and 
former aide to ex-Rep. William E. Dannemeyer, a Fullerton Republican. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Perot activists decided that, in the words of one, "the Republicans 
and the Democrats are the same animal. We would never get our basic issues 
across." 
</P>
<P>
 "We like all three of them very much," Balman said. "We feel they'd make 
excellent candidates in the traditional sense. But we're not looking for the 
traditional sense." Help Wanted * Position: U.S. Congressman, 24th District,

GUARD SHOOTS INMATE TO HALT PRISON FIGHT; CORRECTIONS: OFFICIALS SAY A PRISONER 
AT THE LANCASTER STATE FACILITY WAS WOUNDED WHEN HE AND ANOTHER MAN IGNORED 
ORDERS TO END THE SCUFFLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A guard shot and wounded a state prison inmate Wednesday, saying he and 
another prisoner ignored orders to stop fighting, prison authorities reported. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher Harvey, 25, serving a burglary sentence at the state prison in 
Lancaster, was taken to Antelope Valley Hospital Medical Center, Los Angeles 
County Fire Department officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 A hospital spokeswoman did not release his condition. 
</P>
<P>
 The circumstances of the shooting were sketchy late Wednesday, and it was 
unclear whether Harvey or the inmate he was fighting, Jeffrey Williams, 33, was 
armed. 
</P>
<P>
 A Fire Department dispatcher said Harvey had been shot in the back; a prison 
spokesman said the inmate had been wounded in the left shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
 The shooting triggers an automatic investigation by the prison, but Bill 
Gengler, a spokesman for the state Department of Corrections, said it is 
allowable under state guidelines for guards to shoot to wound inmates if they 
are unable to safely break up a fight. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really a judgment call," Gengler said. "During the investigation, the 
action of the inmate and the action of the correctional officer will be looked 
at to make sure (the shooting) was appropriate for the situation." 
</P>
<P>
 The incident started about 2:30 p.m. when Harvey and Jeffrey began fighting in 
the prison's maximum security facility, where both were housed, Gengler said. 
After the inmates ignored two orders from a guard to stop fighting and lie on 
the floor, the guard fired a single shot from a 9-millimeter carbine. 
</P>
<P>
 Prison officials did not release the name of the guard. 
</P>
<P>
 Harvey had served almost three years of an 11-year, 8-month sentence for 
burglary. Williams has served about six years of a 23-year sentence for assault 
with force and rape, prison officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The $207-million prison, barely a year old, has been the scene of several 
embarrassing escapes and brawls since it opened Feb. 1, 1993. Last week, four 
inmates were hospitalized after they resisted body and cell searches by guards. 
In January, an inmate briefly escaped by hiding in a garbage truck collecting 
trash at the facility. 
</P>
<P>
 George Root, a Lancaster councilman and a member of the prison citizens 
advisory committee, said that although he has been upset by the escapes and 
other incidents at the prison, he feels this latest problem was handled well. 
</P>
<P>
 "They did a good job," Root said. "When prisoners get in a fight that's the 
only way they can stop them."

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; DAMAGED SCHOOLS TO DECIDE HOW TO MAKE UP LOST 
TIME; EDUCATION: EACH CAMPUS WILL BE ASKED TO LENGTHEN THE DAY, ELIMINATE ITS 
SPRING BREAK OR EXTEND THE YEAR.

 Students at 12 San Fernando Valley schools will have to attend classes more 
hours each day, or more days this spring or summer, to make up for time lost 
while their campuses were closed by the Jan. 17 earthquake, administrators said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Administrators, parents and teachers at each school -- including adult schools 
-- will be allowed to choose how they want to make up the time. The choices 
include lengthening the school day; eliminating the spring break, set for March 
28 to April 1, or extending the school year beyond June 17. 
</P>
<P>
 Schools received a memo from Supt. Sid Thompson on Wednesday explaining that 
the decisions must still be ratified by the Board of Education. But Thompson 
has already reached an agreement with the teachers union on the plan, and 
officials said they expect it to be approved by the board. 
</P>
<P>
 The 12 campuses were the only ones in the district that did not reopen by Feb. 
1 -- the last day of the fall semester. The schools are opening at various 
times, according to their degree of damage. 
</P>
<P>
 The schools include Winnetka Avenue elementary in Canoga Park, San Fernando 
Middle School and the West Valley Occupational Center in Woodland Hills, which 
reopened Feb. 3, and Northridge Middle School and Aliso Continuation School in 
Reseda, which reopened Feb. 7. 
</P>
<P>
 The following schools have not yet reopened due to damage: Van Gogh Street 
elementary in Granada Hills, El Camino Real and Kennedy high schools in 
Woodland Hills and Granada Hills, respectively; Stoney Point and Addams 
continuation schools in Chatsworth and Granada Hills, respectively, and the 
adult schools at El Camino and Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
 Both district and teachers union officials said they were pleased that the 
decision on how to make up the time will be left to the individual campuses. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's very fair -- it allows for local school input," said Associate 
Supt. Dan Isaacs, who runs the district's school operations division. "They can 
make the decisions themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 Cathy Carey, spokeswoman for United Teachers-Los Angeles, said most groups on 
the campuses will be included in the decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a local school decision and that means teachers, parents and 
administrators," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The school district closed all schools for five days after the quake. While 
most campuses resumed classes Jan. 25, some 77 schools -- mainly in the Valley 
-- remained shut. 
</P>
<P>
 The hardest-hit campuses -- Van Gogh, El Camino and Kennedy -- will probably 
resume classes in the next few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Students from Van Gogh will attend school at Frost Middle School in Granada 
Hills starting next week, and portable classrooms are being installed at El 
Camino and Kennedy.

<P>
 A man who lived near the devastated Northridge Meadows Apartments pleaded 
guilty Wednesday to illegally entering the condemned building where 16 people 
died during the Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Timothy Loughton, 24, pleaded guilty to one misdemeanor count of trespassing 
and was immediately sentenced to 90 days in County Jail by Van Nuys Municipal 
Judge Gerald Richardson. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hopefully, a 90-day jail term will get the message out to people who would 
trespass during this time of crisis," Deputy City Atty. David Knokey said. 
</P>
<P>
 Richardson also placed Loughton on probation for two years. 
</P>
<P>
 Loughton was arrested Friday morning by Los Angeles police after he was seen 
by workers who were demolishing the apartment complex. Loughton was on the 
second floor when he was taken into custody. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge Meadows had been red-tagged by building inspectors, making it 
illegal to enter the premises. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Walters, a 22-year-old Van Nuys man, was also arrested at Northridge 
Meadows Friday morning, but he has not been charged.

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; 3RD GARAGE TO BE RAZED AT THE NORTHRIDGE MALL; 
REBUILDING: ENGINEERS ADVISE SHOPPING CENTER MANAGERS TO DEMOLISH ANOTHER 
PARKING DECK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Managers of the Northridge Fashion Center, one of the hardest-hit public 
spaces in the Jan. 17 earthquake, have decided to demolish a third parking deck 
at the four-garage mall at the advice of structural engineers. 
</P>
<P>
 The two-level, 1,000-car garage remained standing after the 6.8-magnitude 
earthquake but suffered enough structural damage to be rendered unsafe and 
beyond repair, Lloyd Miller, the mall's general manager, said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The parking garage was built in 1971, when the mall opened, of poured-in-place 
concrete and is situated off Shirley Avenue between the shopping center's two 
Robinson's-May stores. It was the mall's largest parking structure, Miller 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just want to make sure everything is safe," said Miller, who noted that 
the damage included leaning columns. 
</P>
<P>
 Among modern buildings, parking structures "appear to have suffered the 
largest incidence of partial or total collapse" during the Northridge quake, 
according to a preliminary report by UC Berkeley's Earthquake Engineering 
Research Center. 
</P>
<P>
 At least eight public parking structures at popular shopping centers, colleges 
and hospitals were severely damaged -- including two relatively new ones at 
Northridge Fashion Center and one down the street at Cal State Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts studying the failures have cited building code inadequacies, 
cost-cutting measures by developers and the earthquake's unusually high ground 
accelerations as possible causes. Both CSUN and Northridge Fashion Center are 
within a mile of the epicenter. 
</P>
<P>
 One Northridge Fashion Center garage collapsed completely during the 
earthquake, trapping a maintenance worker as he drove a mechanical sweeper 
during his predawn shift. That parking garage, on Shirley Avenue near Nordhoff 
Street, was erected in 1988-89 of precast concrete, a type of construction that 
experts consider particularly vulnerable to seismic damage. Its rubble has been 
removed. 
</P>
<P>
 About half of a second garage -- farther north on Shirley Avenue near Plummer 
Street -- collapsed and is undergoing demolition, Miller said. It, too, was 
built in 1988-89 of precast concrete. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are so badly damaged, they are unsalvageable," structural engineer John 
(Trailer) Martin said of that garage and the newly condemned one. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked why so many of the shopping center's parking structures failed, Miller 
said, "We are analyzing all of that and it's hard to say at present but, again, 
when you're at the epicenter of an earthquake, things like that can happen." 
</P>
<P>
 The remaining garage at the mall is under review by Martin's firm, John A. 
Martin & Associates Inc. of Los Angeles. It is situated off Tampa Avenue near 
the mall's collapsed Bullock's store and, like the newly condemned structure, 
was built in 1971 of poured-in-place concrete and has been closed since the 
quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller said all four parking structures were engineered by the firm of Los 
Angeles structural engineer Robert Englekirk, who could not be reached for 
comment Wednesday.

<P>
 Lockheed Corp. will lend CalArts in Valencia emergency space in which to 
conduct its academic programs while repairs are made to its earthquake-damaged 
campus, it was announced Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The aerospace company has decided to allow the institute to use three 
buildings, comprising 160,000 square feet, in its vacant Rye Canyon research 
center, while CalArts repairs its own facilities.The private arts institute 
sustained between $12 million and $15 million in damages in the Jan. 17 
earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a tremendous act of philanthropy by the Lockheed Corp.," CalArts 
President Steven Lavine said. "Their facility . . . is less than five miles 
from CalArts. This means that we can proceed with our educational and artistic 
programs with a minimum of disruption." Classes that will meet in the donated 
facilities are those in art, film/video, world music and critical studies. 
Certain dance and theater classes will also meet there. CalArts is a four-year 
institution offering bachelor of fine arts and master of fine arts degrees in 
dance, film/video, music, theater and visual arts. KAY HWANGBO

RIVER DESIGNATED HABITAT FOR BELL'S VIREO; ENVIRONMENT: FISH & WILDLIFE SERVICE 
TAKES ACTION TO PROTECT ENDANGERED SONGBIRD'S NESTING AREAS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A federal wildlife agency has designated a 12-mile strip of the Santa Clara 
River as a "critical habitat" for the least Bell's vireo, a long-awaited move 
that biologists say will help protect the endangered songbird's nesting areas. 
</P>
<P>
 The designation triggers another layer of government review for landowners 
seeking federal permits to dredge the river channel or stabilize its banks east 
of Piru, raising farmers' fears that it could slow or even halt efforts to 
protect their property during floods. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are obviously very disappointed," said Marlee Lauffer, spokeswoman for 
Newhall Land & Farming Co., which owns much of the land affected by the 
designation. "We feel that the government study did not take into full account 
the economic impact on farmers of this decision." 
</P>
<P>
 Establishing the protected area does not mean that private landowners cannot 
use their land, said Cat Brown, a biologist with the U.S. Fish & Wildlife 
Service's Ventura office. The area provides minimal protection for the least 
Bell's vireo and Fish & Wildlife reviews would be initiated only when a 
proposed development involves the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
 The most likely time that the Fish & Wildlife Service will become involved is 
when a landowner seeks a federal permit to dredge the river channel or shore up 
banks that tend to crumble when the river is full, Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 In those cases, the owner will need permission to do the work from the agency 
as well as other local, state and federal agencies, she said. Fish & Wildlife 
will review the permit application and make recommendations about what can be 
done to reduce the impact on the habitat, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The added review should not significantly slow down the permit process, Brown 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "For all of the hoopla it takes to add critical habitat, it generally does not 
add that much more protection for the species." 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the 4,200 acres involved in the designation is owned by the Newhall 
Land & Farming Co. and is considered unsuitable for development because of its 
proximity to flood plains, Brown said. The protected area involves a 3,500-foot 
wide strip hugging both sides of the Santa Clara River, starting about two 
miles east of Piru and stretching east to Castaic Junction in Los Angeles 
County. 
</P>
<P>
 Biologists sought protection for the area because it is one of several prime 
nesting sites in Southern California for the least Bell's vireo. Besides the 
Santa Clara River area, nine other stream-side thickets in Santa Barbara, Los 
Angeles, Riverside, San Bernardino and San Diego counties were included in the 
critical habitat classification. 
</P>
<P>
 Only about 500 nesting pairs of least Bell's vireo remain in the United 
States, and about 90% of them nest in the critical habitat areas. Biologists 
hope that management actions will encourage the songbird to reproduce and 
re-establish its dwindling population. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fish & Wildlife Service attempted to designate a much longer portion of 
the Santa Clara River in a proposal five years ago, Brown said. So much 
controversy erupted that the service let the proposal languish until about 18 
months ago, when a National Audubon Society lawsuit forced biologists to 
resurrect the designation. 
</P>
<P>
 Because it was under pressure to move quickly, the agency did not include for 
classification the stretch of the river between Fillmore and Santa Paula, Brown 
said. Some farmers are concerned that biologists eventually will move to place 
the entire river under added federal protection. 
</P>
<P>
 The permitting process to shore up banks has become so entangled in red tape 
over the past few years that it often is not practical to even apply for a 
permit when fast-running waters threaten to take out orchards along the 
riverbanks, said Allen Camp, who owns 200 acres of lemons along the river in 
Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 "It costs so much money in permitting fees and studies that the flood, or the 
rainy season that the farmer is trying to protect his or her land from, has 
come and gone five times before you get through the process," Camp said. "It's 
government at its silliest." 
</P>
<P>
 Lauffer of Newhall Land said the company believes the designated area includes 
parcels that clearly are not habitat, such as a section of parking lot at the 
Magic Mountain amusement park. 
</P>
<P>
 Fish & Wildlife's Brown acknowledged that the boundary lines are not perfect. 
She and other supporters of the habitat, however, say it represents good policy 
and does not place an undue burden on landowners. 
</P>
<P>
 Lloyd Kiff, president of the national Cooper Ornithological Society, said 
development has already carved up 95% of the least Bell's vireo natural habitat 
in California. The remaining 5% must be preserved if the species is to survive, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would ask opponents just how much do they want to leave?" Kiff said. "One 
percent? Two percent? We ought to be able to run society in a balanced way." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown said recent increased sightings of the least Bell's vireo indicate that 
management techniques may be working. 
</P>
<P>
 In the last few years, more nesting pairs of vireos have been found on the 
Santa Clara River. And last spring, a nesting pair was sighted on the Ventura 
River for the first time in about 50 years, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there is some hope that we are doing the right thing and that they 
are moving toward recovery." Bird Protected Area 
</P>
<P>
 A 12-mile-long 3,500 foot-wide segment of the Santa Clara River has been 
designated a "critical habitat" for the least Bell's viraeo, giving the 
endangered bird added protection from dredging and development.

PERMIT FEES WAIVED FOR REBUILDING DAMAGED STRUCTURES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Residents planning to rebuild after last month's earthquake can look forward 
to a little less red tape at City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 Meeting Tuesday in the basement of the Bank of America across the street from 
its quake-battered headquarters, the Santa Clarita City Council voted 
unanimously to waive permit and inspection fees for the rebuilding of 
earthquake-damaged structures. 
</P>
<P>
 Using quake-related emergency powers, the displaced council also voted to 
re-enact its dormant Redevelopment Agency, which can make the city and its 
residents eligible for special funding for repairs and improvements.  
</P>
<P>
 The building inspection fees, which could total up to $1.5 million, are being 
waived mainly in the interest of public safety, city spokeswoman Gail Foy said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's important that people don't bypass the permit process because they don't 
want to pay fees," Foy said. "Besides, we know these are tough times and we 
want to help people out."  
</P>
<P>
 City building official Ruben Barrera said there are an estimated 5,000 houses, 
apartments and businesses in need of repairs requiring permits. 
</P>
<P>
 Anticipating a crush of inspection requests, the council voted to retain the 
Anaheim-based consulting engineering firm Willdan Associated to help conduct 
the inspections. 
</P>
<P>
 Barrera said payment of the firm will be based on the number of inspections it 
conducts and that the sum will be reimbursed through the Federal Emergency 
Management Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 The Redevelopment Agency is expected to cover most of the city. State law 
provides that areas deemed redevelopment zones are eligible for funding from 
local property taxes that would normally go to schools, county government or 
other entities. The money can be used to pay for improvements to private 
property as well as repairs or improvements to the city's infrastructure. The 
council is expected to decide on boundaries for the district soon.

CANCELLATION OF BUS SERVICE FRUSTRATES RIDERS; TRANSIT: SANTA CLARITA TO RELY 
ON METROLINK, WHICH SOME COMMUTERS SAY IS MORE COSTLY AND TIME-CONSUMING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 While the bright blue and white Metrolink trains blossomed with thousands of 
new passengers in the wake of the highway-buckling Northridge earthquake, an 
older commuter transit service connecting Santa Clarita and Los Angeles went 
dormant -- to the frustration of its loyal riders. 
</P>
<P>
 Prior to the Jan. 17 quake, Santa Clarita operated a commuter bus service into 
Los Angeles. It made nine daily runs, cost less to ride per month than 
Metrolink, had a shorter travel time for most passengers than the rail system 
and -- originally handled by the county -- had been around for more than 13 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's why we're upset about the city unilaterally deciding to cancel the 
service," said John Burmahln, who has ridden the commuter bus line since 1980. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Clarita canceled the bus program, looking to the 15-month-old Metrolink 
rail service for out-of-town transit needs and focusing city resources on the 
dozens of other problems created by the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Bus riders say they understood temporarily stopping the program when the 
disaster struck and roadways were closed or clogged, but insist it could have 
been restored by now if city officials weren't trying to pack Metrolink trains 
and provide unnecessary rides in the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they bureaucratically raped us," said Mark Smith, who moved to Santa 
Clarita from Burbank two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "The reason I moved out there is there was going to be flexible transportation 
in (to L.A.)," said Smith. "I've simply lost that with this arrangement." 
</P>
<P>
 Commuter buses are scheduled to resume operation March 1. Transit officials 
say the system is not being ignored and that time is needed to prepare for 
additional riders expected to take the service once it resumes. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fact that riders are loyal and want the service returned is a testament 
to what we were doing," said Ron Kilcoyne, city transportation manager. 
</P>
<P>
 Kilcoyne acknowledged six of the nine commuter buses have been running instead 
to the San Fernando Valley since last week -- three to Chatsworth and three to 
Warner Center -- and others are being used to shuttle Metrolink passengers. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Clarita has purchased four buses to supplement the commuter line when it 
reopens. Kilcoyne said the city is looking to contract out for continued 
transit service to Chatsworth, Warner Center and Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, commuter bus riders say Metrolink is not a fair alternative for 
traveling to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is different in that it costs more money, takes more time and it's not as 
comfortable," said Kevin Corcoran, a bus rider since 1985. 
</P>
<P>
 Monthly Metrolink passes from Santa Clarita are $144 per month, as compared to 
$100 for the commuter bus. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last week I was so tired of the train I drove my car, and I hadn't driven to 
work in six months," Corcoran said. "Metrolink put me into a car; it didn't 
take me out of one." 
</P>
<P>
 Burmahln said his one-hour commute time has doubled using Metrolink and that 
only a handful of people are taking buses into the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why they would force 400 patrons who never rode the train, (never) wanted the 
train, (never) asked for the train, to get off so they could use our buses, I 
don't know," Burmahln said.

Central Electric more than 60 years ago. It grew into a general retailer with 
four stores, 400 employees and a large inventory of appliances, TVs and 
furniture. 
</P>
<P>
 Its owner, West Coast Private Equity Partners, has capitalized on serving 
Southern California's fast-growing Latino population. 
</P>
<P>
 "We speak their language," said Raudel Munoz, a buyer who started at the 
company 12 years ago as a merchandise runner -- helping customers load 
purchases in their cars. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a friendly environment, and we have good service and selection," Munoz 
added. "The customer definitely trusts us." 
</P>
<P>
 In the last 18 months, three stores have opened in predominantly Latino 
districts in Los Angeles County: Commerce, Baldwin Park and Huntington Park. 
</P>
<P>
 After several years of looking to expand into Orange County because of its 
sizable Latino community, the company plans to bring a fifth store to Santa Ana 
next month. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been very successful at the downtown (Los Angeles) site and we think we 
can take that success to other communities," said Hal Compton, Central 
president and chief executive officer. "The feeling of the company was that 
there was opportunity in Santa Ana," where about two-thirds of the residents 
are Latino. Central already draws many customers to its downtown Los Angeles 
store from Santa Ana, Munoz said. 
</P>
<P>
 Compton said Central is scheduled to open March 12 in the former Montgomery 
Ward Clearance Outlet store in a 110,000-square-foot shopping center at the 
corner of Bristol Street and Warner Avenue. Central will occupy a one-floor, 
35,000-square-foot building. The store will employ about 35 people. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Frank Dominguez, president of the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce of Orange 
County, said Central is welcome. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, they're expanding and reaching the Hispanic market," Dominguez 
said. "It's great for the economy and the Hispanic community. I don't see it as 
a threat to any other business here. I think it will provide more of a vitality 
to the economy." 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Burnham, president of Burnham USA Equities Inc., the Newport Beach 
company that owns and manages the shopping center, negotiated a 10-year lease 
with Central valued at about $2.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Burnham said his company sought a tenant that complemented the community's 
ethnic diversity. The population within a one-mile radius of the store is 61% 
Latino. Burnham added that other retailers nearby also target the Latino 
community. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Cypres, the general partner of West Coast Private Equity Partners and 
chairman of Central, said his company's expansion strategy is easily explained: 
About 24 million Latinos live in the United States today, a more than 50% 
increase from 1980. 
</P>
<P>
 "From a customer perspective, it was clear the market that Central served was 
growing and would continue to grow," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Maria Dubravka Pineda, president of International Marketing Media of Newport 
Beach, which specializes in ethnic consumer marketing, said American businesses 
should recognize the economic importance of the Latino community, which spends 
tens of billions of dollars and, if treated well, can become very loyal. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the things that has been a big myth is that the Hispanic community 
here has no buying power. And it's exactly the contrary," Pineda said, adding 
that Latinos spend a greater percentage of their income on food, clothing and 
mass-consumption items than other ethnic groups. "Whatever they earn, they 
recycle fast back into the market." 
</P>
<P>
 Ed Vasquez, communications director for the Latin Business Assn. in Los 
Angeles, said Latino purchasing power in the United States has doubled in the 
last decade to an estimated $200 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 When Latinos go to shop, Vasquez said, "they're going to a place like Central 
that will recognize that this population is credit-worthy, that they have a 
specific need -- and show they're willing to bend backward to meet that need." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At a time when major retailers are turning toward high volume, bargain prices 
and self-service, Central offers lots of customer service -- at the counter and 
after the purchase -- and sells brand-name products at a good price, Compton 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Though most store signs are in Spanish, everyone will recognize the names on 
the merchandise: Sony, Seiko, Singer, General Electric, Whirlpool, Pioneer and 
Hoover. 
</P>
<P>
 Shoppers can also find a selection of fragrances, sofas, stereos, sewing 
machines, dining and bedroom sets, mattresses, strollers, baby furniture, 
Nintendo games, even tires, batteries and bicycles. 
</P>
<P>
 "You feel like you're walking into a department store in Mexico City," Burnham 
said. "It's a very unique tenant for the county; it's the wave of the future." 
</P>
<P>
 In the last three months, Compton said the company has begun to stock some 
apparel including LA Gear shoes, Dingo cowboy boots, cowboy hats, leather 
jackets, Wrangler jeans, and T-shirts. 
</P>
<P>
 In the beginning, Central did not sell sneakers and soccer balls. Paul 
Perelman was an electrical contractor who opened a modest shop in 1929 in 
downtown Los Angeles and sold small electrical appliances. When he died in 
1955, his son, Dick, took over the family operation and expanded the business 
by selling major appliances, televisions and stereos. 
</P>
<P>
 Dick Perelman picked up more business by marketing to Latino customers who 
worked nearby in the garment industry and by letting customers buy goods on 
credit. By 1959, he had moved the store to a larger building at 11th and Main 
streets. 
</P>
<P>
 Business continued to grow, and Perelman built a larger store eight years ago 
at Broadway and Washington Boulevard, which remains the company's flagship 
store and its busiest, drawing about 3,000 shoppers on a Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Three years ago, Perelman sold the store to the Los Angeles-based group of 
investors who plan to continue opening stores in California as well as in other 
western states, said Cypres, adding that Central may eventually open a store in 
Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the company is privately held, Cypres declined to reveal annual sales 
figures. But Santa Ana officials said a retailer the size of Central would 
bring the city a minimum of $100,000 a year in sales-tax revenue, which at 1% 
of the store's sales suggests $10 million in annual receipts. 
</P>
<P>
 Compton said the primary feature that makes buying at Central attractive is 
its flexible finance policy that offers first-time credit. "In the Latino 
community that is a big deal," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Central has between 75,000 and 100,000 active credit accounts despite its high 
interest rate of 21%. "But in reality, because it's installment credit, the 
interest rate paid by the customer is less," Cypres said, adding, "Our true 
interest rate has been 18% recently." 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly 95% of the merchandise sold at Central is bought on installment credit, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pineda said the company is at relatively little risk with its first-time 
credit policy. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have seen that (Latinos') rate of paying on time and paying the loan is 
better than other" ethnic groups, Pineda said. "They're reliable. It's part of 
their culture." 
</P>
<P>
 The stores, which cash paychecks for those with a credit account, also lets 
customers apply for a one-year, unsecured personal loan for up to $1,000, 
Cypres said. "It's really an extension of our credit business." 
</P>
<P>
 Central began the program during the 1992 holiday season when it made about 
3,000 loans. Between mid-November and the end of December, 1993, Cypres said 
8,500 loans were extended to customers. Because of favorable response, loans 
are being offered year-round. In January of this year, 1,000 loans were 
approved. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Cypres said the company has joined with Wells Fargo Bank, one of 
the investors in West Coast Private Equity Partners, in a program to offer home 
loans. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we're trying to do with Wells Fargo is become a full-fledged finance 
company where customers can come into one place and get a loan for their 
particular needs," Cypres said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kathleen Shilkret, spokeswoman for Wells Fargo, said the bank will design a 
program to offer home loans to qualified customers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We find that we are able to piggyback on a company that is able to serve 
Latino customers and that has found a way to effectively assess credit risk in 
ways we're not able to do in a market we wish to be in," Shilkret said. 
</P>
<P>
 To reach its Latino customers, Central spends heavily on advertising. Ads are 
aired on local Spanish-language radio and television stations, and a color 
catalogue of about 30 pages is printed in Spanish and English six times a year. 
 
</P>
<P>
 "The image we're trying to get across is that we're proud to be Latinos," said 
Fernando Lozano, president of Lozano Communications in Los Angeles, which 
handles Central's advertising. 
</P>
<P>
 Lozano said most retail competitors are failing to meet the needs of the 
Latino shopper. 
</P>
<P>
 "You need a cultural understanding before you can address this market," he 
said. "The store that correctly addresses the Hispanic market is going to gain 
recognition and have people buying in their stores. 
</P>
<P>
 "Central is trying to do that. (They're) on the right track. When a Hispanic 
feels comfortable in the store they will come back and shop again and again."

O.C.'S VIRGIN INTERACTIVE TO SELL STOCK; OFFERING: THE VIDEO AND COMPUTER GAME 
PUBLISHER WILL DEAL 16% OF SHARES. OWNER'S SHARE WILL DIP UNDER 50%. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Virgin Interactive Entertainment PLC, Orange County's largest publisher of 
video and computer games, said Wednesday it will put 16% of its shares up for 
sale in an initial public offering. 
</P>
<P>
 Virgin in Irvine will become Orange County's only public game publisher in an 
industry that many analysts believe will introduce the so-called "interactive 
entertainment" of the future, including games that provide stunning 
motion-picture quality video, stereo sound and computer animation. 
</P>
<P>
 The company is owned by Richard Branson, founder of England's Virgin Group, 
the airline and record store empire. Blockbuster Entertainment Video, the giant 
video rental company, and Hasbro Inc., the world's largest toy maker, paid a 
total of $55 million for minority stakes in the company during the past year. 
</P>
<P>
 Blockbuster's $30-million purchase of a 19.9% stake in Virgin last month 
suggests Virgin's total value is $150.7 million. Based on that valuation, the 
company could raise $24 million at $13 a share in the offering. An actual price 
has not been set. 
</P>
<P>
 The company said it will use the funds generated from its offering for working 
capital, product development and general corporate uses. 
</P>
<P>
 Branson, whose holdings include Virgin Atlantic Airways and Virgin Megastores, 
would remain the video game publisher's largest shareholder. 
</P>
<P>
 In the offering, Branson and his family trust would sell 850,000 shares of the 
company's current 9.8 million shares. The company also would issue about 1 
million shares of new stock, bringing the total shares outstanding to about 11 
million. As a result, Branson's stake would slip from 61.7% before the sale to 
46.8%. 
</P>
<P>
 Branson's London-based Virgin Group started its own video game unit in 1983 
and in 1987 it acquired a video game company in Irvine run by British 
transplant Martin Alper, the current president of Virgin Interactive. The 
company changed its name from Virgin Games to Virgin Interactive Entertainment 
last year to reflect its push into broader fields of entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are one of the best-positioned publishers in the market today," said 
John Taylor, an analyst at L.H. Alton & Co., an investment bank in San 
Francisco. "They have good titles, good in-house development, worldwide sales 
distribution and are up to their elbows in connections to Hollywood." 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Devereux, chairman of Virgin Interactive, said the Branson family was 
selling its stock to fulfill a promise it made when the Virgin Group went 
private in 1989. The company said at the time it would return to the public 
market with a highly visible business, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This will also raise a lot of money, and that is good to have in this 
fast-moving, ever-changing industry where opportunities arise every day," 
Devereux said. "It's useful to have a war chest." 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from Nintendo and Sega, which are privately held, Virgin competes 
against larger independent video game companies such as Electronic Arts Inc. in 
San Mateo, Acclaim Entertainment Inc. in Oyster Bay, N.Y., and Japanese-owned 
Capcom in Sunnyvale. 
</P>
<P>
 Virgin has operations in Irvine, London, Paris, Las Vegas, Tokyo and Hamburg, 
Germany. The company has 300 employees, many of whom develop games in Irvine 
and Las Vegas. But it also hires other companies to develop titles published 
under Virgin's name. During the last fiscal year, it released 31 titles for the 
Nintendo and Sega systems and for personal computers. 
</P>
<P>
 The company's more popular titles include "The 7th Guest," a mystery set in a 
haunted mansion that has become the most popular game on computer compact disk 
with sales expected to hit 500,000 copies by spring; "Dune," "Monopoly Deluxe," 
"Cool Spot," "Terminator" and "Robocop vs. Terminator." Virgin worked with Walt 
Disney Co. to develop a game based on the animated feature film "Aladdin" and 
will do so again with Disney's upcoming feature, "The Lion King." 
</P>
<P>
 Devereux said the company is investing heavily in developing games for the 
CD-ROM, or compact disk, read-only memory, a software format similar to the 
music CD that allows the combined use of text, video, graphics and sound. 
Taylor said CD-ROMs are the fastest-growing format in the industry.  
</P>
<P>
 "We are a believer in the interactive future, although we will sell our 
products on whatever technology becomes the dominant format," Devereux said. 
</P>
<P>
 A filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission this week reveals Virgin 
Interactive's financial performance for the first time. Virgin reported a loss 
of $4 million on sales of $99 million for the fiscal year ended July 31, 1993, 
compared with a loss of $1.5 million on sales of $50.2 million in the previous 
fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the loss includes a one-time expense of $6.4 million to convert the 
compensation of two top executives, Alper and Tim Chaney, to stock options. Not 
counting the expense, the company reported a profit of $4.3 million for the 
year, Devereux said. 
</P>
<P>
 The losses in past years were prompted by huge investments -- about $9 million 
a year -- in the next generation of video games. The company's headquarters 
were recently expanded to include 17 game production studios where teams of 
eclectic video game creators labor on expensive Silicon Graphics "graphics 
supercomputers" to build increasingly complicated games. 
</P>
<P>
 The company reported a profit of $1.1 million on sales of $22 million for its 
first fiscal quarter ended Oct. 31, compared with a loss of $2.7 million on 
sales of $12.5 million in the similar period a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 Blockbuster will own 17.7% of the stock after the sale, compared with 19.9% 
before the sale. Hasbro's ownership will decrease from 16.2% before the sale to 
16% afterward. Both companies have options to sell some stock as a part of this 
offering. 
</P>
<P>
 The offering will be underwritten by CS First Boston in New York and Piper 
Jaffray Inc. in Minneapolis, according to the filing this week with the 
Securities and Exchange Commission. The company shares will be traded on 
Nasdaq.

ELECTRONIC ARTS WILL ACQUIRE BRODERBUND; MERGERS: $400-MILLION DEAL BETWEEN THE 
COMPANIES REFLECTS THE CONSOLIDATION TREND IN MULTIMEDIA SOFTWARE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY HARMON, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 In the biggest merger for the emerging home multimedia software industry, 
Electronic Arts said Wednesday that it will acquire Broderbund Software Inc. in 
a stock swap valued at about $400 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The deal reflects the consolidation that has already begun in the multimedia 
software industry as technological advances and the potential for huge market 
growth lure big players such as Sony, Time Warner, Disney and Microsoft into a 
business previously reserved for smaller, lesser-known game developers. 
</P>
<P>
 The advent of more sophisticated, highly realistic graphics and video on 
compact discs known as CD-ROMs are expected to lead to an explosion in the 
entertainment and educational software market. Such technology is seen as the 
forerunner to the interactive television programming to become available on the 
much-ballyhooed information superhighway. 
</P>
<P>
 San Mateo, Calif.-based Electronic Arts, best known for its line of sports 
games such as John Madden Football and PGA Golf, is the nation's largest 
publicly traded developer of interactive entertainment software in the United 
States. Broderbund, based in Novato, Calif., dominates the growing educational 
software market, with its popular Carmen Sandiego series and CD-ROM titles such 
as Just Grandma and Me. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said the two companies would complement each other's strengths. 
Electronic Arts, which published over 200 titles last year for video game 
machines and personal computers, has been weak in the educational-entertainment 
software field known as edutainment. 
</P>
<P>
 Broderbund, with annual revenue of $96 million last year, compared to 
Electronic Art's $400 million, will have more financial backing to experiment 
and expand its aging product line. 
</P>
<P>
 And at a time when the industry is getting increasingly competitive, the 
merger will create a powerful sales and distribution network with the leverage 
to command much-coveted shelf space at retail outlets such as Blockbuster video 
stores and Wal-Mart, where interactive software is making inroads. 
</P>
<P>
 But bigger is not necessarily always better, cautioned David Readerman, an 
analyst with Lehman Bros. 
</P>
<P>
 Recruiting and retaining talented programmers, for example, may be more 
difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 In the deal, Broderbund will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Electronic 
Arts. 
</P>
<P>
 Broderbund's stock rose $3.75 a share to $41.25 trading Wednesday, after 
gaining $2 on Tuesday and $1.75 on Monday. Electronics Arts shares fell 75 
cents a share to $25.50 on Wednesday. The deal was announced after the close of 
trading. Both trade on Nasdaq.

CALPERS WINS CUTS IN HEALTH INSURANCE COSTS; HEALTH: PRIVATE EMPLOYERS MAY BE 
PROMPTED TO SEEK SIMILAR ROLLBACKS, AND CARE PROVIDERS COULD REDUCE THEIR 
RATES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID R. OLMOS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In another display of clout that is likely to accelerate cost cutting 
throughout the state's health care system, the huge California Public Employees 
Retirement System said Wednesday that it has negotiated a 1.1% decrease in the 
cost of health insurance for 920,000 Californians. 
</P>
<P>
 CalPERS, which negotiates health care on behalf of 910 public employers, has 
been cited by President Clinton and others as a national model for health care 
reform. Because of its vast size and reputation as an innovator, its actions 
are closely followed in the industry. 
</P>
<P>
 In California, observers said CalPERS' rate rollback will have a significant 
ripple effect. It is likely to force hospitals, doctors and other health care 
providers to reduce their rates, and it could prompt large private employers to 
seek similar cuts in health premiums for their workers. 
</P>
<P>
 "You might see things happening with the Rockwells and Pacific Bells," said 
Tom Mabie, manager of government markets for Blue Shield of California. 
</P>
<P>
 The reductions, which go into effect Aug. 1, mark the first time the giant 
public employee pension fund has achieved a rate rollback. CalPERS has limited 
premium increases to 6.4% cumulatively over the past three years, contrasted 
with an average increase in health care costs of 30.1% nationally during that 
period. 
</P>
<P>
 The successful reduction comes without any benefit changes and without 
increases in co-payments to members, CalPERS said. Faced with the threat of 
losing access to a significant source of patients, the two dozen health plans 
aligned with CalPERS found ways to cut costs in administration, executive 
salaries and the actual delivery of care, the fund said. 
</P>
<P>
 CalPERS' announcement comes amid a national debate on how best to cope with 
rising health care costs. Congress is considering various proposals, including 
President Clinton's plan for a national health system. 
</P>
<P>
 The rollback "says to other employer purchasing coalitions that you can do 
this on a regional or even a metropolitan basis," said Peter Boland, a Berkeley 
health care consultant. "It sets a precedent that if you are organized and you 
represent a significant number of patients, you can drive down the price." 
</P>
<P>
 Boland said the CalPERS action also puts more pressure on physicians and 
hospitals to reduce their fees, because some insurers may try to recoup lost 
revenue in a process known in the industry as cost shifting. In such shifting, 
hospitals and other providers that are inadequately reimbursed for their costs 
raise their prices to other payers. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics of CalPERS have said the health care savings it boasts about are 
illusory. Suppliers simply pass on those costs to others, they contend. 
</P>
<P>
 Used to that criticism, CalPERS said in a statement accompanying its rate 
reduction announcement that it "does not believe that cost shifting or price 
shifting is occurring to any great degree." 
</P>
<P>
 CalPERS said the reduction it negotiated with 24 health plans constrasts with 
a projected national increase of 8% this year. 
</P>
<P>
 CalPERS said in October that it would seek a 5% rollback in rates, but most 
observers viewed that as a starting point for negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not only interested in price," said Tom Elkin, chief of the CalPERS 
Health program. "As we press for affordable care, we must also assure our 
members that access and quality will not be sacrificed." 
</P>
<P>
 CalPERS is a quasi-public organization whose main purpose is running a giant 
pension fund for government workers.

A SHOT IN THE ARM; QUAKE FORCES HOSPITALS TO CONFRONT THE FUTURE TODAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID R. OLMOS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When hospital experts speak of an industry shakeout, an earthquake isn't 
exactly what they have in mind. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the Northridge temblor -- which caused hundreds of millions of dollars in 
damage to Southland hospitals -- has added new urgency to efforts by these 
institutions to adapt to a rapidly changing health care system. 
</P>
<P>
 The disaster has helped, at least temporarily, to reduce the longstanding glut 
of privately operated hospital beds in the region. It has also forced 
administrators at some quake-damaged hospitals to rethink their strategies for 
adapting to anticipated national health reform and the growth in health 
maintenance organizations and other forms of managed care. 
</P>
<P>
 At two hospitals that were longtime rivals, administrators are talking 
seriously about how they might collaborate instead of simply compete. Some 
hospitals see an opportunity to replace older, damaged buildings with 
facilities that are more in keeping with industry trends. For example, some are 
considering building smaller hospitals with fewer employees. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they've lost (acute care) beds, then they should consider not replacing 
them," said Ronald Spoltore, director of the health care practice at consultant 
Kenneth Leventhal & Co. 
</P>
<P>
 Eighteen area hospitals sustained "major or moderate damage" in the quake, 
according to the Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development. Industry 
sources predict that the repair bill could reach a staggering $1 billion. That 
figure includes an estimated $389 million in damage to County-USC Medical 
Center, a county-run facility where the pediatric and psychiatric buildings 
have been closed. 
</P>
<P>
 Private hospitals that suffered serious damage include St. John's Hospital and 
Health Center, Santa Monica Hospital Medical Center, Northridge Hospital 
Medical Center, Holy Cross Medical Center and Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. But 
only St. John's lost its ability for inpatient admissions. 
</P>
<P>
 Although fewer than 1,000 beds were rendered unusable by quake damage to 
buildings, that loss has temporarily helped to ease the glut of hospital beds. 
Hospitals that didn't lose beds are benefiting from the transfer of some 
patients from the more severely damaged facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, with St. John's temporarily closed to inpatient admissions, 
doctors have had to send their patients to nearby facilities, such as 
Cedars-Sinai and UCLA Medical Center, both of which had been struggling to fill 
beds. Most of St. John's outpatient operations are open. 
</P>

 The hospital bed glut is a national problem that has been getting worse, 
particularly in Southern California. Improved medical technology has allowed 
more surgery to be done outside the hospital. Meanwhile, changes in Medicare 
reimbursement and the growth of managed care have forced hospitals to discharge 
patients "sicker and quicker." 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles County, a leader in managed care, 48% of 31,300 acute care 
hospital beds were empty on any given day in late 1993, according to the 
Hospital Council of Southern California. The trade group estimates that 15% of 
the 260 hospitals in Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino, Ventura 
and Santa Barbara counties will close or merge in the next five years. 
</P>
<P>
 But while nearly all the damaged hospitals have been able to continue 
operating, financial troubles may mount for some. Most of the damaged hospitals 
are believed to have earthquake insurance, but they still must pay millions of 
dollars out of pocket to meet insurance deductibles. Some will seek federal 
disaster aid. With more than half of Southern California's hospitals operating 
at a loss, those expenses could put a strain on financially weak institutions, 
industry experts said. 
</P>
<P>
 The impact of the quake -- and the need to change -- is perhaps most evident 
on the Westside, where damage at two Santa Monica hospitals has forced the 
temporary closure of about 650 acute care beds. The earthquake dealt a 
crippling blow to St. John's, a prominent hospital known for celebrity clients 
such as Elizabeth Taylor and Michael Jackson. Santa Monica Hospital suffered 
less significant damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Industry experts often cite Santa Monica -- and the Westside generally -- as 
having redundant health care services: more hospital beds and more medical 
equipment than the community's population really needs. 
</P>
<P>
 Even officials at Santa Monica Hospital and St. John's concede there is much 
overlap. For example, the two hospitals both have departments in 
obstetrics-gynecology, cardiology and orthopedics.  
</P>
<P>
 "Totally replacing two hospitals that were virtually mirrors of one another -- 
unless it can be demonstrated that the community needs that -- would not be in 
the best interest of patients or the community at large," said William D. 
Parente, Santa Monica Hospital's chief executive and president. 
</P>
<P>
 Executives of the rival hospitals met last week to discuss possible 
collaborative efforts. Such talks presumably could lead to anything from a 
merger to an agreement to rebuild their facilities to complement, rather than 
compete with, each other. A St. John's spokeswoman said Wednesday that a merger 
has not been discussed. 
</P>
<P>
 Parente said there is a "certain wariness" in the talks because neither 
hospital wants to run afoul of federal antitrust rules that govern such 
ventures.  
</P>
<P>
 St. John's estimates that repairs needed to make buildings safe again will 
cost up to $20 million, while totally rebuilding the facility could cost about 
$200 million, said Thomas Herrick, executive vice president. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a golden opportunity for us to rebuild a hospital of the future," 
Herrick said. "We would like to build something that will knock everybody's 
socks off." 
</P>
<P>
 Though plans are not yet final, Herrick said, such a hospital would be much 
smaller and have fewer employees than in the past. It would incorporate the 
latest in technology to transport supplies and people, perhaps including 
computers that would allow nurses to communicate with patients at home. Experts 
predict that in the future, hospitals will be smaller, will focus on treating 
only the sickest patients and will perform an increasing number of surgical 
procedures at outpatient centers. 
</P>
<P>
 Herrick said a rebuilt St. John's would probably be designed around the 
concept of "patient-focused care," an increasingly popular concept in which 
people are tended by patient care "teams" that provide more personalized care.  
</P>
<P>
 "We have to make the person feel special and cared for, but we have to do it 
with less money," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some hospital experts, however, question whether St. John's can move fast 
enough. 
</P>
<P>
 "Health care is so volatile and the industry is changing so dramatically that 
a year out of business could be devastating to them," said consultant Spoltore. 
Declining Hospital Occupancy Rates 
</P>
<P>
 Hospital occupancy rates have been dropping in California since the mid-1950s, 
but the trend has accelerated in recent years due to the growth of managed-care 
insurance, improved technology and other factors. The amount of time that 
patients spend in the hospital has also been declining. 
</P>
<P>
 Occupancy 1983: 66.1% 1984: 64.1 1985: 62.3 1986: 62.3 1987: 64.2 1988: 64.2 
1989: 64.1 1990: 64.2 1991: 53.3 1992: 51.3

INNOVATION / MICHAEL SCHRAGE: READING BETWEEN THE BUDGET NUMBERS; TAXPAYERS NOT 
GETTING THE MOST FROM R&D DOLLARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

associate at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He writes this column

<TEXT>
<P>
 Unless they want to be typecast as ingrates, America's competitiveness 
constituencies better have few complaints about the Clinton Administration's 
proposed science and technology budget. Judged strictly by the numbers, the 
President's package unquestionably delivers the goods during a time of intense 
fiscal austerity. 
</P>
<P>
 While virtually every other budget segment got nicked, the Administration 
asked for more than $71 billion in spending -- excuse me, investment -- for 
federally funded research and development in fiscal 1995 (beginning Oct. 1), 
roughly a 4.1% increase over current levels. Of that, the civilian R&D budget 
would climb $1 billion, to $32 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest single sci-tech winner has to be the Commerce Department's 
National Institute for Standards and Technology. The former National Bureau of 
Standards has seen its budget explode from $381 million in 1993 to $520 million 
in 1994 to next year's proposed $935 million -- an 80% increase in a single 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason? Clinton's competitiveness cabal believes the NIST's Advanced 
Technology Program can be an effective venture capitalist in critical 
technologies -- a civilian counterpart to the Pentagon's historically 
successfully Advanced Research Projects Agency. Can an agency that has had a 
modest record of funding accomplishments preserve quality through this sort of 
scale-up? That's a question that may come back to haunt the Administration in 
1996 as Americans ask what returns they are getting for their government's 
high-tech investments. 
</P>
<P>
 Other winners include the National Institutes of Health, with a 4.7% increase 
to $11.5 billion, including money earmarked for both AIDS research and breast 
cancer analysis; the National Science Foundation, which supports more than half 
the nation's non-medical basic research at universities; global warming 
research, and Vice President Al Gore's multimedia-hyped information 
superhighway, which would see its funding rise to more than $400 million. The 
Administration was generous toward the Human Genome Initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 Even NASA -- which faces a $250-million trimming of its $14.5-billion budget 
-- came out a winner. Here's an agency with a confused mission, a series of 
recent multibillion-dollar fiascoes on its launch pads and orbits and a space 
station proposal that has been transformed from a symbol of U.S. space 
leadership to a medium for international cooperation between America and the 
old Soviet Union (or is that the New Russia?). NASA Administrator Daniel Goldin 
-- as savvy a federal technocrat as they come -- is lucky the Administration 
didn't completely re-engineer his agency. Then again, given that Housing and 
Urban Development and Veterans Affairs share NASA's congressional subcommittee, 
he'd better be careful when the House comes down. 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, when even performance losers can be budget winners, America's science 
and technology establishment knows it has a friend in the White House. 
</P>
<P>
 But true friends had better do more than open their wallets and pick up the 
checks. This Administration's budget proposals ignored several opportunities to 
give taxpayers more R&D value for their dollar. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, the Administration is still struggling with how best to manage 
the nation's multibillion-dollar network of national labs in the post-Cold War 
era. One proposal is that up to 20% of a lab's budget be contingent upon 
finding matching funds from industry to pay for specific research programs and 
projects. That way, labs are forced to become more market-oriented and 
industry-sensitive. Instead, the Administration has opted to push for more 
collaborative ventures between industry and the labs without attaching any 
particular market incentives. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider the information superhighway effort. Does it make sense for 
government to invest more in digital R&D alongside industry? Or should 
government money go into the creation of standards and special procurements 
that would boost private-sector initiatives? These are the questions that the 
euphoria over the technology budget has unfortunately obscured. 
</P>
<P>
 At the core of the problem is performance measures: How does the 
Administration determine the effectiveness of its competitiveness funding? When 
you are funding research for the sake of advancing knowledge, the bottom line 
is secondary. When you are funding research and development to stimulate 
economic growth and enhance U.S. competitiveness in key technologies, how do 
you know you're getting your money's worth? How do you know you're coordinating 
your investments appropriately? 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the Clinton Administration is in the process of completely revamping 
its science and technology infrastructure. The Federal Coordinating Council for 
Science, Engineering and Technology, run out of the White House, has been 
dismissed as toothless. Now there's going to be a new national Science and 
Technology Council, which will absorb the National Space Council, the National 
Critical Materials Committee and the FCCSET. It's supposed to be on par with 
the National Security Council and Bob Rubin's National Economic Council. 
President Clinton is supposed to chair the new committee. One of the biggest 
questions in Washington's technocracy is whether the President will be actively 
involved or will defer management to his vice president. 
</P>
<P>
 Is this merely inside-Beltway baseball? Absolutely not. For better or worse, 
this is an Administration that is putting taxpayer's money where its mouth is 
in the high-tech arena. This is an activist Administration that wants to become 
even more activist. Who gets to run the show has enormous implications for 
everything from defense conversion to biotech to Silicon Valley to Route 128.  
</P>
<P>
 Prediction: Next year's science and technology budget -- and how it's 
coordinated -- will be far more interesting to watch than this year's.

 Military Asked to Cede Some Airwaves: The Clinton Administration today was to 
offer a 10-year plan for forcing the Pentagon and other agencies to give up a 
big block of the airwaves they control so they can be used with new commercial 
technologies, the New York Times reported. Civilian uses might include 
satellite broadcasting and other forms of wireless communication. Under the 
plan, vital public services and national security uses, such as space 
communications and air traffic control, would not be affected.

 QVC May Soon Clarify Its Strategy: Stung by press reports that it is losing 
its campaign to win Paramount Communications Inc., a QVC Network Inc. source 
said, the company will send a clear message to Paramount shareholders before 
the expiration of competing tender offers Feb. 14. According to some reports, 
QVC has been trying to persuade large Paramount investors not to tender their 
shares to rival Viacom Inc., by hinting that new support for its bid could 
materialize Feb. 15 without violating agreed-upon auction rules. The vagueness 
of the message has alternately intrigued and irritated Wall Street traders, 
prompting one QVC source to say, "Before the 15th, we will be quite clear."

 Printing Company Sued for Alleged Pension Violation: Welsh Graphics, a Los 
Angeles printing company operating under Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings, was 
sued for allegedly diverting about $141,000 in employee 401(k) plan 
contributions to the company's general account. The civil suit, filed by the 
Department of Labor and the U.S. attorney's office in Los Angeles, alleges that 
workers were given account statements saying their contributions were being 
added to individual pension accounts but that nearly half the contributions 
were diverted to Welsh's general account and were used to pay the company's 
bills. Pension regulators and attorneys for Robert Welsh, the company's owner, 
agreed to delay distribution of Welsh's personal pension assets -- some 
$179,000 -- for 60 days while they discuss how to restore the employees' money.

MARGOLIN TAKES AIM AT LAWS HE SAYS DILUTE PROP. 103 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS S. MULLIGAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Assemblyman Burt Margolin on Wednesday proposed legislation to repeal recent 
state laws that he and consumer advocates say illegally dilute Proposition 103 
-- the 1989 insurance rollback initiative -- and cost Californians hundreds of 
millions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 Margolin, a Los Angeles Democrat who is expected to officially announce his 
candidacy for state insurance commissioner this week, unveiled his plan at a 
news conference in Sacramento, accompanied by Proposition 103 author Harvey 
Rosenfield and the leaders of three prominent consumer advocacy organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the laws Margolin is targeting, which exempts surety companies from 
Proposition 103, is the subject of a lawsuit that has been appealed to the 
state Supreme Court. Surety companies write performance guarantees for a range 
of businesses, from construction companies to movie studios. 
</P>
<P>
 A state appeals court ruled in December that the law was unconstitutional 
because the Legislature has no right to amend a voter initiative in a way that 
defeats its original purposes. 
</P>
<P>
 Margolin said the ruling, plus the support of consumer groups Consumers Union, 
California Common Cause and the Center for Public Interest Law may give his 
plan the momentum to reverse what he termed an anti-Proposition 103 drift in 
the Assembly.

BREAKING THE GLASS; PANEL SEEKS TO REMOVE CEILING ON PROMOTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STUART SILVERSTEIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 What are the best ways to smash the hard-to-spot barriers that prevent women 
and minorities from advancing in the workplace? 
</P>
<P>
 The executive director of a federal commission exploring the "glass ceiling" 
offers two possible solutions that would give many executives heartaches: 
reinvigorate the labor movement and expand the power of government regulators. 
</P>
<P>
 Joyce D. Miller, the longtime labor leader who runs the U.S. Labor 
Department's Glass Ceiling Commission, says her panel has lots of work to do 
before issuing its recommendations next January on promoting diversity and 
fighting discrimination on the job. 
</P>
<P>
 But Miller, in Los Angeles to conduct a public hearing Friday that will 
spotlight her commission's efforts, says some answers are already clear. 
</P>
<P>
 And, she insists, they aren't hostile to business. 
</P>
<P>
 "Corporations, unions and organizations aren't going to promote programs for 
diversity and for breaking the glass ceiling just because it's the right thing 
to do," Miller said. "The change is going to take place when companies realize 
that diversity is a smart business decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "You want to make more use of everyone in your work force, and the only way 
you are going to is by promoting diversity and breaking the glass ceiling," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Already, Miller said, some major employers are making strides in that 
direction. One of the most effective approaches, she said, is the establishment 
of "mentoring" programs. New or lower-level workers are teamed with veteran 
employees who acquaint them with the ins and outs of their organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 Such programs, she said, can provide insights on "the kinds of things that 
aren't in the employee handbook, such as how you should dress and who are the 
politically important people in your organization." 
</P>
<P>
 Although some employers are voluntarily adopting programs to remove obstacles 
that traditionally have hindered women and minorities in the workplace, many 
others will need prodding, Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
 To that end, she said her commission's members are beginning to think about 
ways that government regulators can do more to promote diversity in the private 
sector. For instance, companies hoping to win antitrust clearance for mergers 
might be required to meet equal employment opportunity standards. Although 
Miller acknowledged that such a proposal would be politically explosive, she 
noted that federal contractors are already are required to pass such tests. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know what the attitudes are toward more regulation. All I can say is that 
we're considering it," said Miller, whose panel's recommendations will not be 
binding. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, she said, the best way to promote equal opportunity is for enlightened 
employers to lead by example -- and for unions to push for the same goals at 
companies that balk. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller, one of the most powerful women in the U.S. labor movement, credits 
unions with spearheading the push for equal opportunity on the job. 
</P>
<P>
 She said unions will do even more on that score if the Clinton Administration 
is successful in passing labor law reform, including a proposal to prevent 
employers from permanently replacing strikers. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller joined the union now known as the Amalgamated Clothing and Textile 
Workers after getting her master's degree in social science from the University 
of Chicago in 1962. Starting as the union's education director in the Chicago 
area, she rose through the ranks to become the first woman elected to the 
executive council of the AFL-CIO in 1980.

AIR FORCE SAYS PRICE OF NEW C-17 TRANSPORT HAS SOARED 27% 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RALPH VARTABEDIAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Air Force is facing a price increase of about 27% on future purchases of 
McDonnell Douglas C-17 cargo jets, a change that raises new questions about the 
program's political feasibility. 
</P>
<P>
 The Air Force said Wednesday that the unit cost of C-17s -- excluding 
research, development, training and spare parts -- has been revised from $255 
million to $325 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The cost figure, known as the unit flyaway cost, is considered the most 
conservative figure used by the Defense Department when stating weapons costs. 
</P>
<P>
 By a more inclusive figure, the Pentagon in its fiscal 1995 budget released 
this week will pay $2.99 billion for six aircraft in the coming year, or 
roughly $498 million for each plane and related spare parts, development and 
other incidentals. 
</P>
<P>
 An Air Force spokeswoman said the cost increase resulted from a recent 
agreement with McDonnell, under which the Air Force may stop C-17 production 
after 40 aircraft rather than the originally planned 120 aircraft. She said the 
program will realize "fewer economies of scale." 
</P>
<P>
 However, the agreement may have a tough time winning approved from Congress. 
Last month, Rep. John P. Murtha (D-Pa.), chairman of the House defense 
appropriations subcommittee, called McDonnell inept and said it was too early 
to say whether Congress would buy the deal. 
</P>
<P>
 But analysts are mixed in assessing the C-17's future. Jack Modzelewski, 
aerospace analyst for Paine Webber, said the government has already sunk 
billions into the program and alternatives are even more expensive. 
</P>

 "It is like the mechanic who tears apart your car and then gives you the cost 
estimate," Modzelewski remarked. "At that point, what choice do you have?" 
</P>
<P>
 Modzelewski predicted that the C-17 will ultimately survive political 
challenges and that the Air Force will buy more than 40 planes. 
</P>
<P>
 If McDonnell can sell 80 planes, its future production costs should drop and 
open up a lucrative foreign market for the aircraft, he added. "This program 
has legs," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Murtha has predicted that Congress is unlikely to fund aircraft beyond the 
current commitment for 40, owing to problems on the program and tight Pentagon 
budgets.

CHASE OFFERS CREDIT CARD TO PAY OFF OTHERS' PERKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Chase Manhattan Bank unveiled an offer Wednesday that allows credit card users 
to rack up frequent flier miles and other awards on competitors' cards, then 
pay them off quickly with credit from Chase. 
</P>
<P>
 The offer would allow consumers to reap the perks of some cards while avoiding 
higher interest rates.The idea is for people to gain the benefits of free 
airline tickets or discounts on new cars with one card, then transfer the 
balances to a Chase line of credit. 
</P>
<P>
 Chase charges 11.1% interest and no annual fee for its credit. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's one of the most novel pirating schemes of 1994 that I've heard of," said 
James Daly, editor of Chicago-based Credit Card News, a trade publication. 
</P>
<P>
 Credit card companies in recent years have offered incentives to encourage 
cardholders to transfer balances from their old cards to new offerings. The 
Chase program takes that concept a step further by issuing checks pre-printed 
with the names of the competing "rewards cards." 
</P>
<P>
 John A. Ward III, a Chase executive vice president, said the idea arose from 
customer research, which showed that cardholders "like to keep the rewards but 
want to get a better rate." 
</P>
<P>
 Ward said he wouldn't call the offer piracy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd like to say we're offering the customer a better deal," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The new product is aimed at the most credit-worthy cardholders. 
</P>
<P>
 Daly said the idea would appeal most to holders of the GM Card, which offers 
cash toward the purchase of most new GM model vehicles, because those cards 
carry sizable monthly balances.

FARMERS PAYS $100,000 FINE TO SETTLE QUAKE COVERAGE CHARGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS S. MULLIGAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Farmers Insurance Group has paid a $100,000 fine to settle 8-month-old charges 
that it illegally failed to offer earthquake coverage to some people, the 
California Insurance Department announced Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The settlement follows an investigation that began after a consumer complained 
to the department that Farmers -- the state's third-largest homeowners insurer 
-- had failed to offer her quake insurance after the 1989 Loma Prieta 
earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 After investigating, the department alleged last June that "Farmers had failed 
to make accurate and complete earthquake insurance offers in 150 of 200 files 
examined." 
</P>
<P>
 Farmers spokesman John Millen called the violations "merely technical 
infractions" of the state law that says insurers may not sell a homeowners 
policy without also offering earthquake coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 Farmers agreed to the settlement more than a month ago, Millen said, adding, 
"The timing of this release -- following a major earthquake -- I find somewhat 
curious." 
</P>
<P>
 Millen said all customers signed forms indicating either acceptance or 
rejection of earthquake coverage, but he acknowledged that the process violated 
the law because the paperwork was not complete. 
</P>
<P>
 The department directed Farmers to mail a special quake insurance offering to 
everyone who became a new homeowners policyholder between Jan. 1, 1992, and 
April 21, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 The department also said it will conduct "a full examination" of Farmers next 
month "to verify ongoing compliance with the law." Farmers has about 13.5% of 
California's homeowners insurance market.

 Texaco, Louisiana Settle Dispute: The state agreed to accept $250 million in 
cash and another $150 million in economic development projects from Texaco Inc. 
to settle a longstanding dispute over oil and gas lease royalties.The 
acceptance, made informally by the state mineral board with Gov. Edwin W. 
Edwards sitting in, must be ratified at a meeting Feb. 22 and accepted by a 
federal judge. The state filed suit in 1988, claiming underpaid royalties 
amounted to $387 million. The first payment would be $150 million five days 
after the settlement went into effect. Two other annual payments of $50 million 
would be made. Texaco would seek either to develop the remaining leases or 
sublet them to the state.

 Fewer Layoffs Planned by HomeFed: Great Western Bank said it is laying off 
fewer HomeFed Bank branch employees than originally announced.Great Western, 
which bought 119 former HomeFed branches in Southern California on Dec. 3, is 
offering jobs to 839 branch employees, or 88% of the branch office work force. 
Initially, the thrift had said it might offer to hire perhaps half those 
HomeFed employees. Normal attrition and increased workload created the need for 
more workers, Great Western said, but most of HomeFed's 630 administrative 
employees will still lose their jobs.

 IRS Offers Chance to Settle Disputed Claims: The Internal Revenue Service 
announced that it is offering about 1,500 taxpayers -- mostly large 
corporations -- a chance to settle billions of dollars worth of disputed tax 
claims involving write-offs for intangible assets such as mailing lists and 
computer software. The issue is of enormous importance to businesses that have 
bought other businesses. Since the mid-1980s, the IRS has disallowed more than 
$14.5 billion in claims by these businesses, touching off a torrent of 
litigation, a Supreme Court decision against the IRS and a change in the law by 
Congress last year.

invested by minority owners Hasbro Inc. and Blockbuster Entertainment Corp. 
Richard Branson, founder of Britain's Virgin Atlantic Airways, owns 46% of the 
company. It reported a profit of $1.1 million on sales of $22 million for the 
fiscal quarter ended Oct. 31, contrasted with a $2.7-million loss on sales of 
$12.5 million a year before.

SPECTRUM COUNTERSUES SCULLEY; COURTS: THE COMMUNICATIONS COMPANY CHARGES THAT 
HIS RESIGNATION TWO DAYS EARLIER WAS PART OF A CONSPIRACY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN WEBER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a blistering counterattack against John Sculley, Spectrum Information 
Technologies said it filed a $300-million lawsuit Wednesday against its former 
chairman, charging that Sculley's resignation two days earlier was the 
culmination of an elaborate conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for Sculley called the Spectrum lawsuit "a complete work of 
fiction." 
</P>
<P>
 The suit alleges that shortly after joining the communications company, 
Sculley decided he wanted to take personal advantage of Spectrum business 
opportunities in concert with a venture capital partner. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly all the important actions Sculley undertook thereafter, Spectrum 
alleges, were part of an effort to create a clear "exit path" and avoid any 
legal liability. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, Sculley -- formerly chairman and chief executive of Apple Computer 
Inc. -- resigned from Spectrum and sued the firm's president, Peter Caserta, 
alleging that Caserta had deceived him about problems at the company. Sculley 
said he had not been informed of a Securities and Exchange Commission 
investigation of the company, the use of controversial accounting procedures or 
large stock sales by Caserta and other insiders. 
</P>
<P>
 The resignation came just 3 1/2 months after Sculley shocked the technology 
industry by joining Spectrum, which has a long record of run-ins with 
securities regulators. Spectrum's stock plummeted on news of his resignation, 
losing about $250 million in value, and analysts were left scratching their 
heads over Sculley's apparent lapse of judgment in joining the firm in the 
first place. 
</P>
<P>
 In its lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Bridgeport, Conn., Spectrum 
alleges that Sculley, not Caserta, was the true deceiver. Sculley was fully 
informed of the SEC investigation and the accounting procedures, Spectrum said, 
noting that the accounting methods were disclosed in SEC reports. The company 
also said it has a document signed by Sculley in which he consented to the 
insider stock sales. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit charges breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty, mismanagement 
and theft of trade secrets. 
</P>
<P>
 Spectrum paints a detailed picture of the events it alleges led up to 
Sculley's resignation. In November, shortly after joining the company, "Sculley 
stated that he wanted to gain control of Spectrum's board and oust old 
management," the lawsuit says. Caserta proposed a plan in which he and the 
others would resign, and Sculley agreed to it, it says. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, however, Sculley had been in close consultations with "his 
new friend and confidante, Arjun Gupta," the suit says, and sought to have him 
join the company. The suit says Gupta, of the prominent Silicon Valley venture 
capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, declined, instead seeking to 
persuade Sculley to leave Spectrum and go into business with him. 
</P>
<P>
 Gupta could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Spectrum alleges that "Gupta convinced Sculley not to oust old management 
because to do so would lock him into Spectrum, and that Sculley would be better 
served by developing an exit strategy from Spectrum." 
</P>
<P>
 Around Dec. 7, the suit says, "Sculley did a sudden about-face and stated that 
he wanted to leave." While he reaffirmed his commitment to Spectrum soon 
afterward, the suit contends, he essentially quit working for the company, 
refusing to build the business and discouraging potential partners from doing 
business with it. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit also charges that Sculley seized upon his accounting complaints -- 
about the treatment of royalty revenue -- as "a pretext to feign disgust and 
resign." He brought in new auditors, KPMG Peat Marwick, and allegedly "directed 
Peat Marwick to use its best efforts to find fault with Spectrum's financials." 
</P>
<P>
 A Peat Marwick spokeswoman called that accusation "totally outrageous." The 
firm resigned Wednesday as Spectrum's auditor. 
</P>
<P>
 Spectrum alleges that Sculley forced a restatement of earnings that would be 
announced the same day as his resignation so that shareholder losses would not 
be attributable to his resignation. 
</P>
<P>
 In a related development, a shareholder suit against Spectrum was expanded to 
include Sculley as a defendant. The suit cites Sculley's late-January denial of 
rumors that he was planning to quit the company and his statement to a news 
service that the firm was not under SEC investigation -- a statement the 
company later retracted.

HEAD OF BURLINGTON AIR EXPRESS STEPS DOWN FOR HEALTH REASONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The chairman and chief executive officer of Burlington Air Express announced 
Wednesday in a letter to employees that he has decided to step down because of 
health problems.  
</P>
<P>
 David L. Marshall became chairman of Burlington, one of the nation's largest 
international air express companies, in 1986.He took the reins as chief 
executive in 1992 when the Irvine-based company fired its co-chief executives, 
Robert I. MacFarlane and Peter Thorrington, who had headed an unsuccessful 
management-led buyout. 
</P>
<P>
 Marshall, 57, also resigned from his post as chief financial officer of 
Burlington's parent, Pittston Co. in Greenwich, Conn. However, he will continue 
to serve on Pittston's board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
 Burlington spokeswoman Raquel Garcia said the company has not yet named a new 
chief executive. Joseph C. Farrell, Pittston's chairman, will assume the role 
of chairman at Burlington as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many of you know that I have been contending with the effects of high blood 
pressure for some time," Marshall said in the company memo. "My doctor and my 
family have asked that I reduce my career responsibilities." 
</P>
<P>
 Marshall said that employees "should not expect any sudden shift in policy as 
a result of this management change." SUSAN CHRISTIAN

ORANGE COUNTY BRIEFLY: COMMUNITY PSYCHIATRIC CENTERS DECLARES A DIVIDEND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Community Psychiatric Centers has declared a one-time, one-cent dividend, 
payable March 15, to shareholders of record on March 1.The dividend is designed 
to make Community Psychiatric more appealing to institutional shareholders who 
invest in companies that pay dividends, said Richard L. Conte, Community 
Psychiatric chairman and chief executive.  
</P>
<P>
 The Laguna Hills company suspended its regular quarterly dividend in 1993 to 
help fund a new, long-term critical care subsidiary. The one-time dividend 
"does not reflect any deviation from the company's growth strategy," which 
calls for an aggressive expansion, Conte said. Community Psychiatric provides 
psychiatric and long-term critical care through 60 separately licensed 
facilities.

FIRM ADOPTS SHAREHOLDER RIGHTS PLAN; MANAGEMENT: BERGEN BRUNSWIG, SUPPLIER OF 
PHARMACEUTICALS, ACTS TO DISCOURAGE TAKEOVER ATTEMPTS. 
</P>

 Drug distributor Bergen Brunswig Corp., preparing to streamline its stock 
ownership and voting rights, said Wednesday that it has adopted a shareholders' 
rights plan to ward off hostile parties who might think of trying to take over 
the company. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan, a common corporate provision that most major companies already have, 
was part of Bergen's decision in 1989 to abolish its dual system of stock 
ownership and voting that gave the Martini brothers, the chief operators, 
effective control of the company. 
</P>
<P>
 No one, however, is trying to take over the nation's largest supplier of 
pharmaceuticals to hospitals and managed care facilities, corporate officials 
and industry analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't imagine somebody wanting to take over a business like this with such 
a small profit margin," said Sally L. Schaadt, an analyst for Fourteen Research 
in New York. "Even on its best days, the company does not have more than a 2% 
profit margin, and they have to work very hard and be a technological superstar 
to get that." 
</P>
<P>
 The company's announcement didn't surprise Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've talked to a couple of institutional investors, and no one reading the 
press release sees it as a big surprise," said Lawrence C. Marsh, an industry 
analyst at Wheat First Butcher & Singer in Richmond, Va. "They read it almost 
as a non-event." 
</P>
<P>
 In trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Bergen's stock price fell 12.5 
cents a share to close at $19.125. 
</P>
<P>
 Brothers Emil and Robert Martini had controlled the company through their 
ownership of the Class B stock, which was entitled to elect six of the board's 
11 directors. But in 1989, the Martinis agreed to give up their Class B stock 
and to convert it by Feb. 24, 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 Emil died two years ago, and his estate has a minor interest in the company. 
Robert is the company's chairman and owns nearly all the Class B stock. He will 
have a 7.75% stake in the company after those shares are converted. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of their 1989 changes, directors agreed that a shareholders' rights 
plan would be put into place by Feb. 24 at the latest, said Michael Sawdei, the 
company's legal counsel. 
</P>
<P>
 The company views Wednesday's announcement as a reminder that what was 
contemplated previously has become effective. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think anyone following us is surprised by this," said Karen Wiley, a 
Bergen spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
 Marsh and Schaadt said that Bergen's operating income, which doesn't take into 
account the $30-million cost of corporate restructuring last year, has been 
flat because drug prices haven't risen as fast as they had in the past. The 
company earned $26 million in its latest fiscal year, which ended Aug. 31, on 
revenue of $6.8 billion.

AVERAGE PRICE OF HOME SLIPS 6.4% IN 1993; REAL ESTATE: MARKET CONTINUES TO 
FAVOR BUYERS, REPORT SHOWS. 'THERE IS STILL A MISMATCH BETWEEN SUPPLY AND 
DEMAND,' ANALYST SAYS.

<P>
 The average selling price of single-family homes in Orange County declined 
6.4% in 1993, a third straight year of decline, which signals that Orange 
County is still a home buyers' market. 
</P>
<P>
 A report by TRW REDI Property Data, prepared for The Times Orange County, 
tracks home sales prices according to dollars per square foot, which 
automatically adjusts the market to help equalize the bigger homes that were 
popular in the late 1980s and the smaller homes that builders and resellers are 
putting on the market now. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1993 figures reveal that prices of existing and new homes are still in 
decline from the 1990 market high. In fact, prices fell more last year than in 
1992, when prices only declined 3.3%. 
</P>
<P>
 "The drop in prices that we've had is significant. There is still further 
pressure on prices and I don't see the prices stabilizing during 1994," said 
Nima Nattagh, research analyst with TRW REDI. "There is still a mismatch 
between supply and demand, with many foreclosures and REO (real estate owned by 
lender) properties on the market." 
</P>
<P>
 The average selling price for an Orange County single-family detached home was 
$132.90 per square foot during 1993. That compares to 1992's average of $142 
per square foot and the market high in 1990 of $152.2 per square foot. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, an average 2,000-square-foot home in Orange County that would 
have sold for $304,400 in 1990 would sell for $265,800 today. The study, which 
tracks home prices since 1980, said home prices in Southern California doubled 
during the real estate boom years of the 1980s, but have fallen almost 13% 
since 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the 13 cities surveyed in the study showed home sale price 
reductions during 1993, some posting a drop of almost 10%. The cities of Brea 
and Lake Forest posted the biggest drops: 9% and 7.9% respectively. Irvine at 
2% showed the smallest price decline and Newport Beach saw its average home 
prices drop by 7%. 
</P>
<P>
 Although demand has stabilized, certain factors -- such as the number of 
houses currently on the market -- could drive prices down in certain cities, 
Nattagh said.  
</P>
<P>
 "I was surprised Brea had such a drop, because I would have thought affordable 
areas would have done better last year," he said. "That leads me to think it 
was some kind of mismatch of supply and demand." Residential Square Footage 
Trends 
</P>
<P>
 The average selling price per square foot for new and resale homes has dropped 
nearly 13% since 1990, when it peaked at $152. Prices per square foot 
countywide and from various cities; 1993 figures are through November:

SEEKING TO EXPAND, DEL WEBB TAPS COSTA MESA DEVELOPERS; BUILDERS: THE 
PHOENIX-BASED BUILDER OF SENIOR COMMUNITIES HIRES TOP OFFICIALS OF THE MEEKER 
COS. TO HELP IT ENTER SOUTHLAND HOUSING MARKET. 
</P>

<P>
 Del Webb Corp., the nation's largest developer of housing for senior citizens, 
has hired the top executives at the Meeker Cos., a longtime Costa Mesa builder, 
to help it enter the Southern California housing market.  
</P>
<P>
 Del Webb, known for large senior housing communities such as the 1,575-acre 
Sun City development in Palm Springs, with homes marketed to buyers 55 and 
older, has long been considering a move into the Southland's conventional 
single-family home market. 
</P>
<P>
 In an unusual move, Del Webb is not acquiring any assets of Meeker but is 
hiring the company's top executives for an undisclosed amount to run a new 
company called Del Webb's Meeker Homes, said Ken Plonski, a spokesman for the 
Phoenix-based developer. 
</P>
<P>
 Del Webb announced Wednesday that it had hired George Meeker Jr. to be 
president and chief executive officer of the new subsidiary; Peter Kuchinsky, 
vice president of operations; Dennis Bacopulo, vice president of sales; and 
Steve Enochs, vice president of finance. 
</P>
<P>
 Meeker Cos., which was established by George R. Meeker Sr. in 1955, has built 
more than 17,000 homes in California, including ones at the Pamilla development 
in Aliso Viejo. George Meeker Jr., who was not available Wednesday for comment, 
joined his father's firm, Meeker Development Co., in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
 "This move is a builder's dream. George has been a small builder, and under 
these market conditions it's a struggle to compete," said John Shumway, 
president of Market Profiles, a Costa Mesa real estate consulting firm. "You 
have to get financing, and it's hard to complete with larger companies. To have 
someone of Del Webb's stature absorb you, it takes all the weight off their 
shoulders." 
</P>
<P>
 Shumway said Meeker has no current housing projects in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 A builder of homes ranging in price from $190,000 to $490,000, Meeker has 
developed projects throughout Southern California, including in Westlake 
Village, south Orange County and in San Diego County. 
</P>
<P>
 A Meeker subsidiary will continue operating in order to complete two 
developments: an 80-home project in Vista, with 25 homes left to build, and a 
120-home project that is half completed in Thousand Oaks, a spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 After the two projects are completed, the Meeker Cos. would be "fully 
integrated" into the new subsidiary, said Del Webb spokesman Plonski. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have observed a continuing improvement in the Southern California housing 
market and believe that our association with George Meeker and his team 
combines the local market experience and financial resources necessary to 
compete very effectively in this marketplace," said Phil Dion, CEO of Del Webb. 
 
</P>
<P>
 He said the company is evaluating several locations in Orange, Los Angeles, 
Ventura, Riverside, San Bernardino and San Diego counties. They could begin 
selling homes the end of the year.  
</P>
<P>
 For fiscal year 1993, Del Webb reported earnings of $24.5 million on revenue 
of $391 million. The company is ranked as the 21st-largest home builder in the 
United States. It sold about 3,000 homes last year.

 Orange County sales of moderately priced new homes more than tripled last 
month from the sales posted in January, 1993, according to figures from Kenneth 
Leventhal & Co., an accounting firm in Newport Beach. During January, 1994, 636 
homes were sold in the county as compared to 177 homes sold in January, 1993, 
according to the study, which surveyed sales of detached homes priced from 
between $185,000 to $240,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's great news," said Dave Chapman, a senior manager at Kenneth Leventhal. 
"The surge in sales in January was led by detached product in the low-$200,000s 
but other types of product experienced good sales as well," he said. Chapman 
pointed out that J.M. Peters Co. sold 11 houses in Coto de Caza priced in the 
mid-$300,000s last month. Last year, that development sold 40 homes.

 Planning Ahead: The South Orange County master-planned communities of Aliso 
Viejo and Mission Viejo accounted for 19% of the county's new-home sales in 
1993, according to the Meyers Group, a real estate consulting firm in Newport 
Beach. Aliso Viejo was the best selling master-planned community in the county 
last year, selling 706 homes. This 6,600-acre community has 14 new home 
neighborhoods currently selling and five more opening in the next two months, 
according to a spokeswoman for the Mission Viejo Co., the developer for the 
project.

HOW TO FIND THE GOOD STUFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press

<P>
 Some tips for buying and investing in jewelry: 
</P>
<P>
 * Select a reputable dealer. Suggestions from family or friends may be 
helpful. Otherwise, visit several stores and compare the quality of products, 
prices and services.Is there a gemologist on staff? Have there been any 
complaints to the Better Business Bureau? 
</P>
<P>
 * Beware of bogus sales. Some dealers constantly hold "70% off" sales, but you 
don't know what they are discounting from if the promotions don't end. A sale 
is a true sale if the merchandise is discounted for a period of time, then 
returned to the higher, regular price. 
</P>
<P>
 * Put it in writing. Purchases should be described in a bill of sale just as 
it was explained by the salesperson. For diamonds, the carat weight, color and 
flaw grades should be noted. For colored gemstones, it should be stated whether 
the stone is genuine or synthetic, among other things. Some dealers may make a 
sale contingent on verification by a gem-testing lab. 
</P>
<P>
 * Get an independent appraisal. Besides verifying facts about the piece, an 
appraisal is needed for insurance. Trade groups like the American Gem Society 
in Los Angeles can provide lists of appraisers. Auction houses like Christie's 
in New York also offer free verbal appraisals. 
</P>
<P>
 * Get insurance. Since standard homeowners' policies cover only a portion of 
jewelry losses, additional coverage is needed. But not all policies are equal. 
For instance, many companies won't reimburse the "full value" of the item but 
rather exercise a "replacement" option. 
</P>
<P>
 * Beware of telemarketers. Gemstone investments can be profitable, but 
millions of dollars have been lost in sophisticated telemarketing schemes. The 
pitch may seem legitimate: gems offered at "wholesale prices" and shipped in 
sealed containers with convincing reports from gem-testing labs.

LUSTER RETURNS TO JEWELRY INDUSTRY; SALES: SHOPPING CHANNELS ARE A GEM TO THE 
BUSINESS, AS SAVVIER BUYERS DEVELOP AN EYE FOR BAUBLES BOTH FAUX AND GENUINE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VIVIAN MARINO, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The sparkle has returned to the jewelry industry after years of, well, 
lusterless sales. 
</P>
<P>
 An improved economy, repeal of the luxury tax and new marketing options, such 
as home-shopping television, are behind the turnaround, which began a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the confidence in wearing jewelry is coming back," said Simon Teakle, 
who heads the U.S. jewelry division of Christie's auction house, where 1993 
sales rose 25% over the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
 "In recessionary times, it wasn't socially correct to wear a tremendous amount 
of jewelry," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Teakle says consumers not only are buying more baubles and bangles but also 
have become savvier about what's available. Many may know, for instance, that 
the finest red rubies come from Burma, that Mexican opals are fiery orange and 
that diamonds occur naturally in nearly every color of the rainbow. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet distinguishing a ruby from a red spinel, an emerald from a tsavorite 
garnet, or even 10-karat gold from 14-karat gold can be extremely difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 This lack of expertise -- along with the availability of lab-grown synthetics 
and imitations resembling the real thing but usually worthless -- can leave the 
average buyer vulnerable to unscrupulous dealers or suppliers. 
</P>
<P>
 "For every color you like, there are probably five or six gemstones in that 
color," noted Antoinette L. Matlins, co-author of "Jewelry & Gems: The Buying 
Guide." "What you see with the naked eye may not be reality when you buy gems 
and jewelry." 
</P>
<P>
 What makes jewelry buying especially difficult is the fact that such purchases 
are often anchored with emotions, particularly during holidays like Valentine's 
Day, among the busiest time for the industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Madison Avenue is largely responsible. Advertising campaigns portray diamonds 
and gems as the ultimate gift of eternal love. 
</P>
<P>
 The most successful of these campaigns comes from the De Beers' cartel, which 
markets 80% of the world's diamonds. De Beers has successfully perpetuated the 
illusion of the diamond as a rare and valuable stone. In reality, diamonds are 
plentiful but tightly distributed. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a tremendous exploitation of consumers based on the allure of 
gemstones and the mythology of them," Matlins said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Someone on the TV shopping network may mention diamonds or rubies or 
sapphires or emeralds and a certain image instantly comes to mind . . . of 
having a highly valuable jewel. But in fact, it doesn't escape the fact that it 
could be garbage." 
</P>
<P>
 Steffan Aletti, president of the Jewelry Industry Council in New York, said he 
has received few complaints about the discounted jewelry sold on home-shopping 
programs. But he acknowledged there are some dealers who do misrepresent what 
they sell. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are some emeralds that are more appropriate to grace the bottom of a 
fish bowl than a ring," he said. "The more desperate people are looking for a 
deal, the most likely they are to get stung." 
</P>
<P>
 One way to avoid getting stung is to deal with reputable dealers, who have 
trade-group affiliations and experts on the payroll. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't need to be a gemologist to buy a ring," Aletti said, "just as you 
don't need to study a schematic to buy a Sony or a Panasonic" TV. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, there are some basic rules to keep in mind when buying jewelry. 
</P>
<P>
 For diamonds, size isn't the most important factor. Diamonds are graded and 
priced based on cut, color, clarity and carat weight, with a flawless, 
colorless stone considered the most valuable. 
</P>
<P>
 A half-carat, round-cut diamond that's nearly flawless and with excellent 
color can cost far more than a 3-carat diamond with poor color and noticeable 
imperfections -- about $13,400 vs. $7,200, Matlins' book says. Fancy shapes 
usually sell for about 5% to 15% less. 
</P>
<P>
 Matlins says the four Cs for gemstones are "color, color, color, and color!" 
</P>
<P>
 If the color is good, she says, the presence of flaws usually won't detract 
from the stone's value as significantly as with diamonds. Keep in mind, 
however, many stones are treated with heat or oils to enhance their color, a 
process that is legal so long as the dealer discloses that to the customer. 
</P>
<P>
 The availability of the stone is also crucial. A chrome tourmaline may have a 
color similar to a green zircon, but because there's less supply, the 
tourmaline costs more -- about $300 to $1,400 for 1 to 3 carats vs. $240 to 
$680, says "Jewelry & Gems."

 AZUSA: The City Council voted to pay off an $88,000 mortgage and $5,000 in 
interest owed by Peregrinos De Emaus so that the homeless shelter can raise 
money to bring the property up to city building codes. 
</P>
<P>
 COVINA: The City Council decided to keep the city afloat financially by using 
most of the money in a reserve fund. The council voted last week to remove 
$1.75 million -- roughly the deficit for this fiscal year -- from a fund used 
to replace and repair city equipment. One official said the $537,000 left in 
that fund is insufficient to cover anticipated costs. 
</P>
<P>
 LA CANADA FLINTRIDGE: The City Council turned down a request from the Descanso 
Gardens Guild for a $200,000 loan to cover deficits and help complete a 
$1.5-million rose garden.  
</P>
<P>
 LA VERNE: The city has won a state transportation grant of nearly $140,000 to 
spruce up Arrow Highway between E Street and San Dimas Canyon Road. The city is 
seeking volunteers to help plant trees and shrubs along the road in April. 
Information: (909) 596-8706. 
</P>
<P>
 ROSEMEAD: The City Council passed a resolution opposing a plan by two water 
districts to "drought-proof" the San Gabriel Valley by replenishing its 
underground drinking water supply with highly treated sewage water. 
</P>
<P>
 SIERRA MADRE: The city narrowed the field for police chief to three Southland 
candidates: Lt. Edwin A. Jakoala, 51, of the Palos Verdes Estates Police 
Department; Sgt. Robert K. Petitt, 47, and Lt. Joseph R. Surgent, 51, both of 
the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
 SOUTH PASADENA: The City Council asked the city attorney to draft a resolution 
to place a library tax on the June 7 ballot. The tax on a 2,000-square-foot 
home would cost $24 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 TEMPLE CITY: The City Council turned down for now the gift of the 1903 Teagle 
House for use as a historical museum because of the $100,000 cost of relocating 
it from San Gabriel. 
</P>
<P>
 WEST COVINA: In an effort to boost ridership, the City Council approved a $20 
subsidy for residents who ride the Metrolink trains to jobs in downtown Los 
Angeles.

CITY HALL NEWS: POLICE CRACKDOWN QUELLS PROBLEMS

 All's quiet on the Garvey Strip since police stepped up patrols against drug 
dealing and prostitution in motels there last summer, and an upcoming city 
ordinance aims to keep it that way. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to do anything and everything we can to prevent prostitution and 
drug dealing from returning to that part of town," Baldwin Park Mayor Fidel A. 
Vargas said."If (motel owners) step so much as two inches beyond the limits of 
the law, then we're going to crack down." 
</P>
<P>
 From June through September, Police Chief Carmine Lanza said police heightened 
their surveillance of these hotels. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, he said, there have been no arrests for prostitution there, and 
fewer than five drug arrests. By contrast, there were approximately 150 arrests 
made during the summer, said Sgt. Mike Taylor. 
</P>
<P>
 In September, the city shut down two hotels -- the B & B and Lucky 7 -- for 
health, fire and building code violations, Lanza said. The B & B reopened in 
November. Manager Pete Patel, said the crackdowns have improved conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 To make sure things stay that way, the city is drafting an ordinance that 
would prohibit motels from renting a room more than once in 24 hours.

A TIME WHEN BUSINESSES CAN CASH IN ON TRADITION

 For Chinese New Year, N.B.C. Seafood Restaurant in Monterey Park serves dinner 
combinations with names like "good business," "good fortune" and "money come 
in."  
</P>
<P>
 Hong Kong Supermarket stocks up on oranges, whose name in Mandarin sounds like 
the word for wealth, and dumplings, whose boatlike shape resembles Chinese gold 
bullion. 
</P>
<P>
 These items -- meant to attract prosperity in the coming year -- have more 
than symbolic significance for the establishments that sell them. The New 
Year's celebration is a windfall for Chinese businesses much as Christmas is to 
department stores and malls. 
</P>
<P>
 Elaborate holiday feasts boost sales for markets and restaurants. Phone lines 
are jammed and flights to Asia booked as celebrants reunite with family and 
friends. And Asian bankers profit from increased transactions, as people 
withdraw money to meet expenses, settle old debts or embark on new investments. 
</P>
<P>
 Dangling brilliantly near the entrance of the Hong Kong Supermarket are red 
scrolls and firecrackers, a paper dragon and gold-colored coin banks. Displays 
of holiday nuts and mushrooms are heaped in front of the aisles. 
</P>
<P>
 To ensure good fortune in the new year, many Chinese people dine on foods like 
oranges, peanuts or pineapples, whose names in the various Chinese dialects 
sound like words for wealth or money, store manager Philip Pan said. And there 
has to be plenty of everything. 
</P>
<P>
 "On that traditional New Year's eve dinner, you have to prepare a lot of 
food," he said. "More than enough for everybody. The more you have left over, 
that means the more wealth, the more savings you have for next year." 
</P>
<P>
 Sales pick up rapidly in the weeks before the holiday, he said, and more than 
double on New Year's eve. 
</P>
<P>
 Celebrations are often held at restaurants. N.B.C. Seafood manager William Lee 
said business picks up by about 50% in the two weeks before New Year's when 
companies hold banquets, and in the weeks afterward, when families gather for 
feasts. 
</P>
<P>
 A red Buddhist shrine with offerings of oranges and incense to the gods of 
property and business marks the entrance of Chinese American Live Poultry in 
Rosemead. Here, customers choose from a variety of fowl -- pheasants, squab, 
ducks, geese and, most importantly, chicken. The back room is stacked to the 
ceiling with cages of birds that are butchered fresh and sold with the heads 
and feet still attached. 
</P>
<P>
 Sales leap to three times the normal rate in the days around the holiday, and 
customers sometimes wait more than an hour in lines that stretch down the 
block, owner Quan Phu said. And while fresh chicken is an important New Year's 
dish for any Chinese family, it's especially crucial to Buddhists, who 
sacrifice it to their ancestors on that day, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 "They don't want chicken without wings or head or feet," he explained. "They 
want a whole chicken, a perfect one." 
</P>
<P>
 The holiday is an opportunity for celebrants to visit with family and friends 
they may not have seen all year, and many take that opportunity to travel home 
to Asia. Helen Koo, owner of America Asia Travel Center in Monterey Park, said 
flights to Hong Kong, Taiwan and Mainland China increase about 45% or more over 
the holidays. Sales have jumped from 600 in December to 1,000 this month, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Travelers from the opposite direction boost local real estate firms, said 
James Chou, vice president of George Realty Group in Alhambra. 
</P>
<P>
 "In Taiwan, China, everybody has a vacation, so a lot of people plan to 
travel, maybe a month, looking for some property," he explained. 
</P>
<P>
 In the eight years that George Realty has operated, Chou said, the company has 
seen sales increase 15% to 30% in the weeks around New Year's, as Asian 
investors seek business deals and recent immigrants purchase homes. 
</P>
<P>
 And those who can't make it across the Pacific can always phone home. Sprint 
spokeswoman Juanada Teas said calls to Asia increase 20% to 30% over normal 
levels during the period from New Year's Day through the following weekend. AT 
& T has no similar statistics available, spokeswoman Lorraine Wong said, but 
the company's Chinese-speaking operators are working six-day weeks to meet the 
increased demand. 
</P>
<P>
 New Year's customs can be a mixed blessing for business, said John Hou, 
president of the Asian Pacific Bancorp. and member of the Monterey Park 
planning commission. Because arguments are forbidden during the 15-day holiday, 
he explained, bankers and other businessmen scramble to collect outstanding 
debts before New Year's Day. 
</P>
<P>
 In general, bankers come out ahead, though, said Philip Ma, manager of Cathay 
Bank's main branch in Chinatown. 
</P>
<P>
 "You see a lot of transactions going on because people see it as a time of 
prosperity, to celebrate what you've accomplished in the past year," he said. 
"You see more activity among people who like to invest." 
</P>
<P>
 This year -- the year of the dog -- bodes well for business, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 "The dog's nature is very loyal," he said. "So it should be a conservative, 
growing year, (although) I wouldn't expect a big jump."

ON NEW YEAR, A DOG HAS ITS DAY; CELEBRATIONS: TRADITION BLENDS WITH 
MULTICULTURALISM IN MONTEREY PARK'S FLOWER MARKET FESTIVAL. ALHAMBRA WILL USHER 
IN 4692, THE YEAR OF THE DOG, ON SATURDAY.

 A yellow dragon swirled furiously at the head of the Monterey Park Chinese New 
Year's festival parade Sunday, dancing around the string of firecrackers that 
blasted in the street and up the wall of the Quang Hoa Supermarket on Garvey 
Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 To the tunes of the Alhambra High School marching band, a Chinese lion reared 
its head, rolled its eyes and charged toward the store. Shaking its mane, it 
devoured a head of lettuce tied to a red envelope of lay-see , or lucky money 
that had been tossed by store employees. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Chinese tradition, the red envelopes and lettuce signify fortune, 
the firecrackers chase away evil spirits and the dragon and lion, fearsome as 
they appear, bring good luck. 
</P>
<P>
 That luck apparently held back the storms that showered Los Angeles on Friday 
and Sunday night. Only a light drizzle dampened festivities during the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 About 50,000 people lined Garvey Avenue for the third annual New Year Flower 
Market Festival in Monterey Park to celebrate the start of Year of the Dog 
4692, said Esther Pang, one of the event's coordinators. 
</P>
<P>
 The two-day celebration included the parade, a preliminary portion of the Miss 
Asia Pacific Pageant, music, dance, and displays by 50 businesses of everything 
from traditional narcissus flowers to Taiwanese pop music CDs. "This brings me 
back in touch with my cultural roots," said Thompson Chen, 26, one of the 21 
dragon dancers who hoisted the parade's satin serpent. A native of Hong Kong, 
Chen said the celebration in Monterey Park evokes memories of the citywide 
festivals of his childhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Therese Rincon, Miss Monterey Park, waved to parade-goers from atop the city 
firetruck, and said the celebration was a first for her. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very excited because I'm not Chinese. This is so new to me. It's so 
exciting," she said. "Now, I even want to learn the language." 
</P>
<P>
 Evelyn Lo, a Monterey Park princess, said that's the objective of the 
festival. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it unites the people," she said. "Not just the Chinese people, but 
the whole Monterey Park community." 
</P>
<P>
 Nowhere was the cultural mix more evident than on the music stage. On Sunday 
morning Aztec singers from Mark Keppel High School were followed by the 
Roosevelt High School Latin Jazz Band and the graceful traditional dances of 
the Ming Yuan Institute dancers.  
</P>
<P>
 Later in the day, the Amazing Zion travelers sang plaintive gospel music 
before the Mad Chinamen took the stage to belt out pop tunes in Chinese. On 
Saturday, Howard Ma won first place and $1,000 in the Karaoke contest. 
</P>
<P>
 Displays of fresh foliage, including vivid red firecracker flowers, ginger 
flowers and birds of paradise brightened the street, in keeping with the flower 
market theme. 
</P>
<P>
 The highlight of the horticultural festival was a display of traditional 
carved narcissus bulbs by master carver Quin-Shin Gong from Monterey Park's 
sister city, Quanzhou, China. The bulbs blossom into fragrant bouquets that are 
called "water fairies" in Chinese. 
</P>
<P>
 This weekend, the celebration continues in Alhambra with a street festival and 
parade Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 The festival, featuring two entertainment stages and 150 business, arts and 
crafts vendors, will be held from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. on Valley Boulevard in 
Alhambra between Garfield Avenue and Atlantic Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 The parade, with 150 entries, including 12 floats, will begin at noon on 
Valley Boulevard at Del Mar Avenue in San Gabriel and conclude at noon at 
Garfield and Valley in Alhambra. 
</P>
<P>
 The celebration includes a four day carnival today through Sunday at Moor 
Field across from the street fair, and a Chinese banquet Friday, at the Sam Woo 
Seafood Restaurant in San Gabriel.

NEWCOMERS SURE TO FILL 11 CITY SEATS; POLITICS: TEN COUNCIL MEMBERS AND A MAYOR 
ARE LEAVING OFFICE. VOTERS WILL FILL 56 MUNICIPAL POSTS ON APRIL 12. 
</P>

<P>
 At least one new mayor and 10 new council members will be elected across the 
San Gabriel Valley on April 12, as 56 municipal seats open up this year in 21 
cities. 
</P>
<P>
 In the city elections, 11 seats will be filled by newcomers. Six incumbents 
have opted to retire, three are seeking higher office and two have served the 
maximum terms allowed for council members in their cities. 
</P>
<P>
 "I realized how much I needed to be involved with my family," said South 
Pasadena Mayor James C. Hodge Jr., 44, who will retire after eight years on the 
council. "My daughters were 8 and 9 when I joined the council. . . . They grew 
up while I was in meetings." 
</P>
<P>
 Voters will elect new council members in Arcadia, Azusa, Claremont, Glendora, 
San Marino, Sierra Madre, South El Monte and South Pasadena, as well as a new 
mayor in Azusa. 
</P>
<P>
 Minorities make up more than a third of the 88 new candidates and constitute 
14 of the 45 incumbents. 
</P>
<P>
 In Arcadia, Sheng Chang, a Chinese American resident, hopes to become the 
first member of an ethnic minority elected to that City Council. Incumbents 
hold two of the seats up for election this year, but Councilman Robert 
Harbicht, 53, is barred from running again after serving two four-year terms. 
</P>
<P>
 In San Marino, Alex Tse and Allan Yung, both of Asian descent, are among four 
candidates for two seats, including one vacated by retiring Councilwomen 
Suzanne Crowell. In South El Monte, retiring Councilman Jim Kelly will be 
replaced by one of four Latino candidates who will also be challenging 
incumbent Raul Pardo. 
</P>
<P>
 Since nominations are closed for the city elections, eight incumbents and two 
newcomers in five cities who face no opposition are assured election: incumbent 
Councilmen John Ferrero, Manuel A. Garcia and Lawrence Mayo in Industry, and 
Jim Edwards, Joan C. Feehan and John W. Hastings in La Canada Flintridge. Mayor 
Terry Dipple of San Dimas also had no opposition. 
</P>
<P>
 In Bradbury, two new unopposed councilmen, Rick Barakat and Mark Flewelling, 
last week replaced recalled council members Audrey Hon and Tom Melbourn. 
Councilwoman Bea LaPisto-Kirtley faces no challengers. 
</P>
<P>
 A number of prominent politicians will disappear from the political landscape 
after deciding not to seek reelection: council members Nick Presecan of 
Claremont, Mollie MacLeod of Glendora, Suzanne Crowell of San Marino, Jim Kelly 
of South El Monte, and Hodge and James S. Woollacott of South Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought I was due some time off after eight years on the council," said 
Presecan, a 54-year-old environmental engineer. 
</P>
<P>
 A step up the political ladder has inspired four Azusa city officials not to 
defend their seats. After nearly a decade in office, Mayor Eugene F. Moses is 
leaving to make a bid for state Senate against Assemblywomen Hilda L. Solis. 
Councilmen Stephen J. Alexander and John R. Dangleis are vacating their seats 
to compete for the mayor's post, along with Councilman Tony Naranjo, who still 
has two years to serve on the council.

LAW; A FASHION MINUS IS A SAFETY PLUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANNE LOUISE BANNON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Youngsters don't usually pay much attention when new laws go into effect, even 
to one that has a significant impact on their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 But many of them are aware of the state law that took effect the first of the 
year. In fact, the law weighed on their minds -- literally. 
</P>
<P>
 Youngsters interviewed at three San Gabriel Valley elementary schools were 
familiar with the new requirement that they wear bicycle helmets until the age 
of 18. Their responses were divided between those who considered the law a good 
idea and those who, to put it mildly, did not. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hate it!" said Andrew Yamada, 10. The fifth-grader at Baldwin Stocker 
Elementary School in Arcadia was, nonetheless, wearing a helmet as he parked 
his bike before school. The helmet clashed with way he likes to look, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fellow students who oppose the law were equally as vocal and most were 
concerned about how the helmets look. 
</P>
<P>
 "The helmet makes me feel like I'm Einstein, 'cause I have such a big head," 
said Alex Armstrong, 10, a fourth-grader at Mayflower Elementary School in 
Monrovia. 
</P>
<P>
 Even those who agreed that the law is a good one said they felt a little funny 
wearing a helmet. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's good for our safety," said Domini Possemato, 10, who attends 
Baldwin Stocker. But wearing a helmet is "kind of embarrassing." 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Lanza, 12, a sixth-grader at Coolidge Elementary School in San 
Gabriel, agreed about safety. "Everyone is going to look a little weird. But 
that's OK." 
</P>
<P>
 Of the three schools where students were interviewed, Coolidge had the most 
active helmet promotion program. It held a helmet sale last year and even 
donated some helmets to families that couldn't afford them. 
</P>
<P>
 Safety was the main reason students supported the law. "It's pretty good 
because if a car hits you and you splatter against the windshield, it won't 
hurt you so much," said Chris Beebe, 11, a Baldwin Stocker sixth-grader. 
</P>
<P>
 Billy Van Wye, 10, a Mayflower fourth-grader and a vocal opponent of the law, 
said the safety issue was overrated. "I know you can get hurt, but most people 
don't, and most people don't wear helmets, and they're going to get too many 
unnecessary tickets," he said.

EDUCATION; COMMUNITY SERVICE PLAN FOR STUDENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Temple City high school students will be required to perform 100 hours of 
community service in order to graduate, under a new policy that was expected to 
be passed Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 The policy would make Temple City Unified School District one of a handful in 
the state and the second in the county to make such service mandatory. 
</P>
<P>
 For more than a decade, South Pasadena Unified School District has required 45 
hours of community service for graduation. 
</P>
<P>
 In Temple City, students will be required to donate 30 hours of service in 
each of their first two years of high school and 20 hours of service each year 
as a junior and senior. 
</P>
<P>
 Janice Murasko, program author and district service coordinator, has lined up 
opportunities such as teaching English as a second language, working with the 
U.S. Forest Service or making home repairs for senior citizens. Students also 
can propose their own ideas, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Studies show gang activity and dropout rates go down and test scores go up in 
states and cities that have tried this," she said.

TRANSPORTATION; 21 FREEWAY STRUCTURES IN VALLEY NEED RETROFITTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Caltrans data show that 21 freeway bridges, interchanges and connector roads 
in the San Gabriel Valley are still too weak to withstand a strong earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 After the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake in the Bay Area, Caltrans in 1990 
identified road structures statewide that needed retrofitting because the 
columns supporting them tend to fracture in a quake. Caltrans scheduled 243 
structures in Los Angeles County for quake strengthening, 48 of them in the San 
Gabriel Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Four years later, 27 of those 48 retrofits have been completed and work is in 
progress on seven more. However, construction contracts have yet to be awarded 
for 14 structures in the region. Under a 1990 state law, all contracts were to 
have been awarded by the end of 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 The San Gabriel Valley retrofits are slightly ahead of neighboring Southland 
regions. Countywide 44% of the overpasses that need to be retrofitted are 
complete, compared with 56% in the valley. 
</P>
<P>
 The need to retrofit took on new urgency after the Jan. 17 Northridge quake. 
Ten of the 11 roadways that collapsed in that quake were scheduled for 
strengthening. The 11th was not on the list. All of the 106 county overpasses 
that had been retrofitted survived the temblor. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans' chief engineer, James. E. Roberts, has called for the program to be 
put on an emergency schedule that allows for quicker awarding of contracts. 
Roberts said a court dispute with a union delayed retrofitting. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics of Caltrans maintain that the transportation agency has wasted time 
and money building freeways before securing old ones. Each bridge costs 
approximately $500,000 to retrofit and takes a year. Road Work 
</P>
<P>
 The 21 road structures where retrofit has not been completed:  
</P>
<P>
 * San Bernardino Freeway (I-10) Campus Road ramp in Monterey Park. 
</P>
<P>
 * I-10 connector ramp to the busway in Monterey Park. 
</P>
<P>
 * I-10 bridge over Warwick Road in Monterey Park. 
</P>
<P>
 * I-10 connector ramp near the San Gabriel River. 
</P>
<P>
 * Two I-10 bridges over the San Gabriel River. 
</P>
<P>
 * Two connector roads between I-10 and San Gabriel River Freeway (605). 
</P>
<P>
 * Connector road between I-10 and Orange Freeway (57). 
</P>
<P>
 * Pomona Freeway (60) bridge over several El Monte streets. 
</P>
<P>
 * Two I-605 bridges over the Santa Fe Flood Control Basin. 
</P>
<P>
 * Alta Canada Road bridge over Foothill Freeway (I-210) in La Canada 
Flintridge.

</P>
<P>
 * I-210 bridge over the San Dimas Channel. 
</P>
<P>
 * I-210 intersection with California Route 30. 
</P>
<P>
 * I-210 intersection with the Corona Freeway (71). 
</P>
<P>
 * Connector road linking the 71 and I-10.

PEOPLE: SECURITY TIGHT ON SET OF KERRIGAN'S TV COMMERCIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Security was tight at the Pasadena Ice Skating Center as skater Nancy Kerrigan 
recently shot a Reebok television advertisement inside the closed-off facility. 
</P>
<P>
 Kerrigan, who has recovered from a Jan. 6 attack in which a man struck her on 
the leg with a metal bar, was protected by police and security guards at the 
filming Jan. 22. She was not visible to the public. Plastic sheeting screened 
off the ice center entrance and transit trailers obscured other views. 
</P>

 The commercial will appear as part of Reebok's "We Believe in the Athletes" 
series during this month's Winter Olympics.

 The executive director of a New York City AIDS organization will take the top 
spot at the AIDS Service Center starting Feb. 15. 
</P>
<P>
 Larry A. Pagnoni was appointed executive director by the center's board of 
directors after a six-month search. Pagnoni formerly headed the Upper Room AIDS 
Ministry, a support group in Harlem for homeless people with AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 Pagnoni replaces Mary Nalick, who resigned last year for personal reasons. In 
his former job, Pagnoni helped the AIDS ministry grow from a deficit to a 
$2.4-million annual budget in four years. He has a bachelor's and master's 
degree in theology. 
</P>
<P>
 The AIDS Service Center, the largest such group in the San Gabriel Valley, has 
also officially dropped its former name, the All Saints AIDS Center. The board 
approved the name change because they learned that some people avoided the 
center because they mistakenly believed it was a religious organization.

CRIME; MURDER CONFESSION FOUND ON TAPE; SLAYINGS: POLICE SAY A RECORDED APOLOGY 
INDICATES THAT A PASADENA MAN KILLED HIS WIFE BEFORE INTENTIONALLY CAUSING A 
FATAL FREEWAY CRASH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A Pasadena warehouse worker's taped apology to his three young children has 
led detectives to conclude that he probably murdered his wife and then 
committed suicide by driving his truck across the double yellow line of the 
Corona Expressway in San Bernardino County, killing another man. 
</P>
<P>
 On Feb. 1, a truck driven by Jorge Jesus Gonzalez, 39, slammed head-on into a 
pickup driven by 29-year-old Thomas David Shanahan, a Fountain Valley 
construction worker. 
</P>
<P>
 Police were ready to call the wreck an accident until they found the body of 
Gonzalez's wife that afternoon on the living room floor of the family's home at 
173 W. Maple St. in Pasadena. Honoria Josefina Gonzalez, 38, had died of head 
injuries, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The audiotape of Gonzalez's apology, unearthed in the wreckage of Gonzalez's 
truck Friday, prompted investigators to reclassify the case as a 
homicide-suicide-homicide. Pasadena police detectives closed the case Monday on 
the assumption that Gonzalez killed his wife, Lt. Denis Petersen said. 
</P>
<P>
 Friends reported talk of the couple's having a troubled marriage, and police 
searching the house found a restraining order against Jorge that Josefina never 
filed. But there were no witnesses to the murder, believed to have occurred 
Feb. 1, and the tape Gonzalez left in his car never tells detectives what he 
did, only that he was sorry he did it, Petersen said. 
</P>
<P>
 The bizarre nature of the triple killing is compounded by the good fortune the 
family had been experiencing in recent years. After coming to the United States 
from Mexico in 1980, the Gonzalezes fell on hard times and joined the Door of 
Hope Family Homeless Shelter in Pasadena in 1990, Director Jim Martin said. 
</P>
<P>
 After spending five months in the shelter, Jorge, Josefina and their three 
young children had saved enough to rent a house and applied to the local office 
of Habitat for Humanity, a national agency that provides funds for low-income 
families to build their homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Jorge spent more than 600 hours helping to build the Maple Street home, 
Habitat Vice President Pat Myers said. Josefina got a job with World Vision, a 
Christian international relief organization based in Monrovia, World Vision 
spokesman Bruce Brander said. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're talking about a family that was just totally upward mobile," Martin 
said. "They had no drug-addiction problems, no gambling problems. . . . Jorge 
was a good father who loved his children. They were two great people." 
</P>
<P>
 A relative traveled to Pasadena from Mexico to take custody of the children, 
who were staying at a shelter in Altadena. The bodies of Jorge Gonzalez and 
Thomas Shanahan had not been claimed by relatives this week, the San Bernardino 
County Coroner reported.

POLITICS: CHAMBER'S USE OF A HISTORICAL SITE RAISES QUESTIONS ABOUT POSSIBLE 
CONFLICT OF INTEREST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At the mention of the name Chamber of Commerce, one automatically thinks of an 
organization whose purpose is to bring business and tax revenue into the city. 
If you live in Monterey Park, the roles are reversed.City tax revenues flow in 
huge amounts into the chamber's coffers with no discernible or checkable 
benefit to the General Fund. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Dec. 31 meeting, El Encanto was on the agenda after a lengthy executive 
session. El Encanto, a "historical site," was bought by the city in 1980 for 
$250,000. The building was badly run down and the city, in its infinite wisdom, 
began renovation to make the building safe and available for civic use. The 
cost of renovation is $500,000 for a total investment of $750,000 of our tax 
dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the renovated El Encanto rooms are not large enough for commission 
meetings and the facility has literally no parking available. Once again, the 
chamber is "Johnny on the spot" with a letter requesting the right to 
headquarter themselves and to manage the El Encanto, thereby controlling who 
may use the facility. Without asking for further bids, community input, rent, 
fees or possible Parks and Recreation management, the council approved the 
request. So, once again tax dollars flow to the chamber without proof of 
viability or a cent in return. 
</P>
<P>
 Two council members, Mayor Marie Purvis and Councilman Fred Balderamma, were 
on the chamber's board of directors when the $70,000 giveaway was approved. It 
should also be noted that our city manager, Chris Jeffers, sits on the 
chamber's board and other managers have active roles in the chamber. One cannot 
distinguish between the city and the chamber, which brings into question legal 
and moral conflicts of interest.

710 FREEWAY: TRAFFIC WOES AND HISTORIC HOMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I am writing in response to Michael J. Messina's letter. I am not a member or 
former member of any committee nor have I ever held any political office. 
</P>
<P>
 I cannot come up with a solution as witty as his to solve the traffic problem, 
but I do know one thing: Building or extending freeways has never solved 
traffic problems. It only means more traffic! 
</P>
<P>
 I also cannot believe that Messina is so naive that he thinks (the proposed 
extension of the 710 Freeway) will not devastate a major part of South 
Pasadena. I am sure that if Messina's home were in South Pasadena, he would be 
fighting tooth and nail to make certain that the freeway not go through. 
</P>
<P>
 I am not a crazed "zealot." I am just a concerned citizen trying to make sure 
that South Pasadena does not end up like so many cities with freeways running 
through them. The cities Messina mentioned are indeed nice, except for the 
areas that the freeway runs through. 
</P>
<P>
 This is not a temporary inconvenience. This is permanent and total. You cannot 
put back the historical homes that are in the way of this "benefit." In this 
case, more is not better. More freeway only means more problems later on. What 
city and what house is next? Maybe yours, Mr. Messina.

COMMUNITY NEWS / REGION: 5 WESTSIDE AGENCIES RECEIVE UNITED WAY QUAKE AID 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The United Way of Greater Los Angeles has raised $928,000 for earthquake 
relief, donating $73,800 of the sum to five Westside agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 New Directions on La Cienega Boulevard, T.H.E. Clinic for Women in Crenshaw, 
Jewish Family Services in Santa Monica, Project Heavy West in Venice and the 
Venice Family Clinic were the Westside agencies receiving money through the 
United Way's Earthquake Relief Fund. 
</P>
<P>
 The agencies will use the funds to repair their buildings, replace equipment 
or offer counseling to victims of the Jan. 17 earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles, 44 agencies have received United Way disaster funds. United 
Way raises funds for 300 community service organizations, including nine 
chapters of the American Red Cross.

DEAD-END CASES PILE UP; DETECTIVES ARMED WITH FEWER RESOURCES TACKLE THE 
GROWING PROBLEM OF UNSOLVED HOMICIDES  
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The news shocked the Chinese American community in Los Angeles and Orange 
counties. Ho Fu (Eric) Chiu, 20, a state amateur badminton champion and 
president of Cypress College's Chinese student association, was dead.  
</P>
<P>
 Likable, hard-working, handsome and athletic, Chiu led a life full of promise 
in his adopted country. Nonetheless, the Taiwan native was found dead May 20, 
1992, shot inside his car, which was left in a recreation center parking lot in 
El Monte. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly two years later, Chiu's killing remains unsolved, despite hours of 
investigation and dozens of people questioned. "There's absolutely no reason 
that we've found for this murder," said El Monte Police Det. Linda Parrott, 
frustration in her voice. 
</P>
<P>
 Chiu's death typifies a growing phenomenon nationwide that has hit San Gabriel 
Valley cities especially hard. People are literally getting away with murder. 
</P>
<P>
 Nationwide over the past 30 years, homicide detectives have found themselves 
stymied by more and more unsolved cases. In 1961, 92% of homicides were 
declared solved, with suspects arrested. Three decades later, the rate has 
plummeted to 67%, two out of three solved. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 30 San Gabriel Valley cities, the rate is even worse. Less than half -- 
47% -- of all homicides resulted in arrests, according to 1992 state Department 
of Justice Statistics. 
</P>
<P>
 That same year, the Los Angeles Police Department solved 59% of its homicides, 
640 of 1,094, while the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department solved 62%, 333 
of 565 homicides, according to state statistics. 
</P>
<P>
 "The solves are going down, that's true," said El Monte Police Lt. Ken Jeske, 
who oversees homicide investigations in his city of 106,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "We should be at 80% or 90%," Jeske said. "But it's about 50% for everybody in 
Southern California because we all suffer the same problems." 
</P>
<P>
 Gone are the days when detectives spent their days mainly on domestic dispute 
slayings -- husband/wife or boyfriend/girlfriend killings, such obvious crimes 
that police call them "walk-throughs" or "self-solvers." 
</P>
<P>
 More victims now are felled by strangers or by gang members, end up as 
unidentified bodies dumped in parks and streets or come from vulnerable 
populations, such as the elderly and immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 And these kinds of cases are coming when police departments find themselves in 
some ways less equipped to investigate them. The informant network, used by 
detectives for decades, is withering. Plus, detectives are a younger, less 
experienced group with less commitment to staying in homicide bureaus, say 
criminologists and veteran detectives. 
</P>
<P>
 All of it combines to make murder, the most heinous of crimes, one of the 
least solvable. A look at a handful of the San Gabriel Valley's unsolved 
killings illustrates why homicide detectives are having a tough time solving 
cases.

 At 8:15 on a Friday evening in September, 1992, Tung Kuang Ku, 39, the sole 
employee in the Teriyaki Bowl on West Duarte Road in Arcadia, was shot when an 
armed gunman demanded the couple of hundred dollars that was in the cash 
register. The Rosemead father of two died from a gunshot to his torso. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses saw only the race of the gunman but could not describe him or his 
getaway car in detail. With no one to question and little else to go on, police 
hit a dead-end, said Arcadia Police Lt. Dave Hinig. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Ku's death is a typical "stranger homicide," a killing in which the victim 
didn't know his slayer. Absent a relationship between victim and slayer and 
with no description of the killer or a weapon, police can't even begin to look 
for a suspect, Hinig said. Instead, they must rely on luck: that fingerprints 
taken at the scene might lead them to someone later. 
</P>
<P>
 Stranger homicides represent a changing pattern of murder in American society, 
said Albert Cardarelli, professor of criminology at the University of 
Massachusetts, Boston, and a specialist on unsolved killings. These murders 
often are gratuitously violent, he said, with gunmen pulling off a successful 
robbery and killing cooperative victims for no reason. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 About 9 p.m. on Feb. 12, 1992, Hipolito (Junior) Villalobos, 16, was walking 
home in Baldwin Park with three new high school friends, all alleged gang 
members, when gunmen jumped from a passing car and chased down the group. The 
youth was felled by six gunshots to the head and upper torso. 
</P>
<P>
 Villalobos' three companions, who faced the same gunmen just steps away, told 
police they couldn't describe the car or the shooters -- even after witnesses 
and anonymous tips pointed to possible suspects. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's nothing we can do (to the companions)," Baldwin Park Police Det. 
David Reynoso said. "We can interview them until we're blue in the face, but if 
they don't want to tell us, they don't want to tell us." 
</P>
<P>
 Silence is a common obstacle in gang-related slayings, swelling the number of 
unsolved homicides in cities such as Baldwin Park, Pomona and Pasadena, where 
gang killings account for one-third to half of all murders. 
</P>
<P>
 Fear of retribution keeps most witnesses quiet in gang-related slayings, 
Reynoso said. Threats of physical harm and death -- mere words a few years ago 
-- are now backed up by violence from gang members. 
</P>
<P>
 Many gang members observe the unwritten credo that they will pay back the 
death of a fallen comrade. Thus, they remain silent before police or 
prosecutors, Reynoso said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gang slayings usually provide little in the way of hard evidence. The weapon, 
if recovered, often can't be traced to the shooter because it has changed hands 
multiple times, Reynoso said. 
</P>
<P>
 Family members of Junior Villalobos understand the fear that keeps witnesses 
quiet. "They're scared," said Maria Rodriguez, his aunt. "Would you talk?" 
</P>

 At noon on June 17, longtime United Farm Workers union activist Artemisa 
Guerrero, 68, was found stabbed to death in her Monterey Park apartment. Her 
attacker broke in through a back window, sexually assaulted her, stabbed her to 
death and ransacked her apartment before fleeing. Neighbors, many of them 
elderly, said they heard nothing, saw no one. 
</P>
<P>
 Guerrero, a generous, giving and politically active woman, knew scores of 
people. Sheriff's homicide Detective Bob Tauson has searched futilely for a 
possible motive and suspect. The case also poses problems because Guerrero was 
among the vulnerable -- the elderly and the ethnic, populations with higher 
rates of unsolved murders, according to Cardarelli's research. 
</P>
<P>
 Asian, Spanish-speaking or Eastern European immigrants may not be able to even 
speak to police to provide basic information. And negative experiences with 
corrupt or antagonistic police in their own countries may make them fear 
officers here. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the elderly, the obstacles to solving homicides are physical. Witnesses 
often are other elderly people, the victim's roommates or neighbors. 
Oftentimes, such witnesses have poor hearing, eyesight and memories that make 
them unreliable, police said. Medication taken by the elderly can increase 
their unreliability. 
</P>
<P>
 For Guerrero's family, the lack of an arrest keeps them in permanent mourning. 
"It's an issue that's never closed . . . like a wound that keeps on breaking 
open," said Andy Apodaca, Guerrero's son-in-law. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 On the afternoon of Nov. 12, 1992, Pomona police made a grisly find: the 
charred remains of an unidentified man with a bashed skull, his body dumped in 
the flood control channel near Kellogg Park in Pomona. 
</P>
<P>
 Fingerprinting proved useless. Only one clue remained -- the letters "stelum" 
on his blackened leather belt. Twelve days later, a breakthrough. Jose Arturo 
Gastelum, 35, a Mexican living in San Diego County, had been staying at the 
Shilo Inn in Pomona until his disappearance Nov. 9. 
</P>
<P>
 The case ultimately led to Mexico, where Gastelum may have been a currency 
courier in the drug trade, said Pomona Police Lt. Ron Frazier. Typically, he 
said, couriers pick up cash from drug sales here and take it back for 
laundering in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 Gastelum may have been skimming. His execution may have been meant to send a 
message, Frazier said. But police still lack hard evidence and a suspect, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Gastelum's murder typifies the difficulties in "body dump" homicides. Bodies 
without identification are found miles and days away from the actual crime 
scene and time. Such a find stalls the investigation until the authorities 
identify the dead person. 
</P>
<P>
 "Without knowing who the victim is, it just about shuts you out," said 
Sheriff's Lt. Frank Merriman. "There's absolutely nowhere to go." 
</P>
<P>
 The number of such cases appears to be growing in part because of increased 
drug trafficking, investigators say. In Los Angeles County, detectives have 
found so many bodies of drug traffickers from an eastern coastal state in 
Mexico that they call such victims "Sinaloa Cowboys." In the San Gabriel 
Valley, the Angeles National Forest, the Whittier Narrows Recreation Area and 
the Santa Fe Dam Recreation Area provide plenty of isolated acreage for such 
dumps. 
</P>
<P>
 Beatrice Gastelum, 41, said she thinks her husband of 17 years was killed for 
"business reasons." But she insists his business was selling U.S.-purchased 
auto parts in Tijuana, not carrying money. 
</P>
<P>
 The death has shaken her 17-year-old son, Arturo Jr. "He doesn't want to study 
and he can't regain his peace of mind," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The job of solving these homicides has become even more difficult because of 
two significant changes, criminologists and investigators said: the withering 
informant network and the mass departure of veteran homicide detectives. 
</P>
<P>
 One veteran detective said he used to call on 25 to 30 informants -- 
prostitutes, loan sharks, veteran gang members and bikers. Now "if you have 
half a dozen informants, that's a lot," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Decreasing incentives are largely responsible. Illicit drug wealth has far 
overshadowed the petty cash or minor legal help offered by detectives in 
exchange for information. Some gang members have enough money to hire top-notch 
attorneys; others do a turnaround and offer detectives money. 
</P>
<P>
 One investigator recalled a drug dealer who had information about a slaying 
but refused to divulge what he knew. He tried to end detectives' questions by 
offering $1.2 million in cash and a boxful of automobile pink slips from which 
to choose a Mercedes Benz or BMW; instead he was convicted of attempted 
bribery. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Gang members who could turn into informants also remain silent, knowing that 
if called to testify in court, they could be killed in retribution, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, many younger investigators avoid gathering informants for fear the 
association could harm their careers. "Informants are not very nice people -- 
they're crooks," one detective said. 
</P>
<P>
 The informant-police relationship often includes dining and drinking with 
informants, giving them home phone numbers, helping their families, looking the 
other way at their petty crimes and doing them small favors, all in exchange 
for information. With the internal scrutiny police undergo nowadays, younger 
detectives prefer to avoid such contact, said criminologist Cardarelli. 
</P>
<P>
 Another reason homicide solve rates are decreasing is that older, experienced 
detectives, hired in the big-budget days of the 1960s and 1970s, are rtiring, 
police and criminologists say. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going through a period of losing a lot of very experienced detectives," 
said Sheriff's Lt. Merriman, whose detectives often aid the smaller San Gabriel 
Valley cities in homicide investigations. "All those people starting to leave 
are taking with them 30 years of experience." 
</P>
<P>
 Their ranks are increasingly being filled by ambitious officers who see 
homicide bureaus not as a life goal, but as good resume material, said veteran 
detectives and criminologists. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "My career goal is to be a cop. Their career goal is to be an administrator," 
said an older detective of his younger colleagues. "Homicide (bureau) was a 
goal in and of itself . . . Now it's a steppingstone." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the federal government's war on drugs has siphoned off younger 
people who typically work patrol and advance to homicide bureaus. With 
investigative jobs available in the Drug Enforcement Administration, U.S. 
Customs, the federal bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, and the Inspector 
General's office, the grind of beat policing can be avoided with a shortcut to 
a detective's job, said Robert Lorinskas, an associate professor at the Center 
for the Study of Crime, Delinquency and Corrections at Southern Illinois 
University in Carbondale, Mo. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Given the tougher crimes, the shrinking number of informants and the departure 
of veteran detectives, the unsolved homicide rate is likely to remain the same 
for the next few years, say police and criminologists. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, homicide detectives say their unsolved cases eat at them daily. 
They continue to plug away at them in between their new investigations. 
</P>
<P>
 "I still ask about this case," Parrott said of the Chiu murder. "It's an 
active and open case . . . I've had cases solved five and seven years after the 
fact with someone coming forward with one little bit of information that 
finished it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't ever give up." Case Closed

EDUCATION / MARY LAINE YARBER: A PRIMER ON CORRESPONDENCE PROGRAMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY LAINE YARBER, Mary Laine Yarber teaches English at Santa Monica High 
School. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I get a lot of phone calls and letters from readers curious about 
correspondence courses. Most want to know if such courses are "real," and how 
to tell the legitimate ones from the scams. 
</P>
<P>
 Although there are some bad apples in the bunch, many schools offering 
correspondence programs are worthwhile and credible. Indeed, the last couple of 
decades have brought a sharp increase in the number of such schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Many educational goals can be accomplished through the mail. You can, for 
example, take courses on nearly any subject found on a regular campus. You can 
also earn various professional certifications and all types of college degrees 
-- from the two-year associate's degree to a doctorate or law degree. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, home study takes many forms. The most common is correspondence -- the 
student receives study materials, assignments and tests in the mail from a 
particular college or school, then sends back the completed work to be graded. 
</P>
<P>
 Thanks to recent technology, however, many home study programs now use more 
interesting methods. Teaching courses via cable TV hookup or by videotape has 
become popular. So has using computer software and communicating with the 
school from home with a computer modem. 
</P>
<P>
 Giving credit for life experience is another trend at many home study schools. 
For example, if you've been handling the payroll and bookkeeping for a small 
business, you may be given credit -- even toward a degree -- for a basic 
accounting class. 
</P>
<P>
 The benefits of home study are many, particularly for people who work full 
time and therefore can't indulge in the typical college experience. 
</P>
<P>
 Home study programs generally entail admission requirements that are less 
harsh and complicated than those of traditional schools; many don't even 
require the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) or other entrance exams. 
</P>
<P>
 The master's program offered by California State University at Dominguez Hills 
in Carson is fairly typical of credible correspondence education programs. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cal State program offers a master's in five subjects, and all work is done 
through home study (projects, papers, and a thesis or creative project). 
Instructors guide students by telephone, mail and cassette, and grading is 
based largely on written assignments. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal State requires at least 30 hours for the master's; a full-time student can 
complete it in a year or so. And, since Cal State is a public university, the 
course of study is about as inexpensive as they come (about $1,500 for the 
whole program). Also important: Cal State schools are well-respected and 
accredited, and Dominguez Hills' correspondence program has been in operation 
for decades. 
</P>
<P>
 If you're interested in a correspondence course or degree, bear in mind that 
not all programs are like Cal State's. Be sure to ask questions before 
enrolling to find the program that's right for you. 
</P>
<P>
 First, ask the school's representative how long the school has existed. Of 
course, it's possible that a new school may be excellent, but a fairly decent 
history is usually preferable. 
</P>
<P>
 Find out about the instructors' backgrounds too. Do they have degrees, 
specialized training or job experience in the subjects they'll be teaching? 
</P>
<P>
 Make sure you find out all the required courses and costs, to avoid surprises 
down the road. Get that in writing too; any school that won't provide a written 
course of study and payment plan should be pulled from your pool right away. 
</P>
<P>
 Examine the school's accreditation as well. This is difficult because 
accreditation is voluntary and qualifications vary from state to state. 
</P>
<P>
 In general, though, schools bearing the accreditation of agencies approved by 
two government services. For a list of school accreditation agencies, write to 
the Council on Postsecondary Accreditation, 1 Dupont Circle North, Suite 760, 
Washington, D.C. 20036, or the Department of Education, Division of Eligibility 
and Agency Evaluation, Washington, D.C. 20202. 
</P>
<P>
 Another reliable accreditation agency for vocational schools and 
degree-by-mail schools nationwide is the National Home Study Council, at 1601 
18th Street Northwest, Washington, D.C. 20009.

THEATER REVIEW; KNIGHTSBRIDGE SCORES WITH SIMON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY LOYND, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Neil Simon's father-daughter comedy "I Ought to Be in Pictures" is not vintage 
Simon, not nearly in the same league as, say, "The Odd Couple." But Simon has 
yet to write an indifferent play, and his 1980 three-character observation of 
modern family manners gets a lump-in-the-throat revival by the Knightsbridge 
Theatre in Old Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 On the way to closing the curtain on its first year in the historic Braley 
Building, the Knightsbridge has established its commitment to a mix of 
classical, contemporary and original work. (Upcoming is "Cyrano de Bergerac," 
"The Elephant Man" and "Richard III.") 
</P>
<P>
 The theater's most consistent strength, while presenting three plays 
simultaneously on a staggered schedule, has been its level of acting. Its 
weakness continues to be its lackluster production design. Both are apparent in 
"I Ought to Be in Pictures." 
</P>
<P>
 The play is winningly anchored by gruff-but-poignant Art Kempf as a faltering 
screenwriter unexpectedly visited by a 19-year-old daughter he hasn't seen 
since he walked out on his family 16 years earlier. The young woman, who has 
hitchhiked from New York to her dad's rundown Hollywood bungalow, claims that 
she wants to be in pictures and that her dad owes her. 
</P>
<P>
 What she really seeks, though, is her father's love, and Julie Maddalena 
convincingly catches the teen-ager's tough veneer and underlying vulnerability. 
</P>
<P>
 The play's third figure, the dad's on-again, off-again girlfriend, is 
sensitively portrayed by Linda L. Rand, who holds her own despite being 
sandwiched between two irrepressible characters. 
</P>
<P>
 The highlight of the production, directed by Priscilla Finch, is Kempf's 
rendering of the dad's exasperation on hearing his daughter's illusions about 
breaking into movies. As she prattles about cozying up to the stars as their 
parking valet at Tinseltown parties, his disbelief reaches an eye-popping 
crescendo. 
</P>
<P>
 Producers Joe and Barbara Stachura have updated the script with some harmless 
contemporary references. But the shortfalls in costuming, lighting and set 
design are irritating. 
</P>
<P>
 The dad's bungalow is supposed to be scruffy -- at least before the daughter 
spruces it up in Act 2 -- but here the faded furniture and blank plywood wall 
are off-putting instead of artfully moody. 
</P>
<P>
 The theater should overcome this lack of attention to physical detail, which 
is undermining some artful acting. 
</P>
<P>
 "I Ought to Be in Pictures," Knightsbridge Theatre, 35 S. Raymond Ave., Old 
Pasadena, Saturday, 5 and 8 p.m., Sunday, 7:30 p.m. Ends March 20. Tickets 
$10-$15. (818) 440-0821. Running time: 2 hrs.

 PREPS 
</P>
<P>
 The San Gabriel Valley's reputation as a hotbed of girls soccer talent has 
been embellished this season by several high school teams that will figure 
prominently in the Southern Section playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Pasadena Poly appears headed for its fourth consecutive Division 1-A title. 
The Panthers, under Coach Steve Freeburg, entered the week 18-2-1 and 9-0 in 
the Prep League. 
</P>
<P>
 Pasadena Poly is led by a trio of three-time All-Southern Section players: 
center-fullback Maricela Oceguera, the 1993 division player of the year; 
center-halfback Beth Freeburg and forward Blanca Fromm. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior center-forward Jennifer Giampaolo, a first-team All-Southern Section 
selection last season, is also having another outstanding year for Pasadena 
Poly. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Those players) came in, we started winning, and they haven't lost a CIF 
championship yet," said Freeburg, in his fifth season as coach. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Walnut took a psychological step toward a Division III championship by 
defeating defending Division III champion Los Altos, 1-0, in a Miramonte League 
game at Walnut last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Sarah Chavez scored the lone goal as Walnut beat the Conquerors for the second 
time this season. Walnut entered the week 8-0 in league. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Altos, Diamond Bar and Arcadia are a few of the other area schools that 
are expected to challenge for section championships. COMMUNITY COLLEGES

PRIVATE HOSPITAL TO OPEN CLINICS IN VENTURA, OXNARD; MEDICINE: THE NEW 
FACILITIES WILL COMPETE WITH THE COUNTY'S PUBLIC HEALTH AGENCY FOR LOW-INCOME 
PATIENTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A private Ventura hospital plans to soon open its first two community clinics 
to compete with Ventura County's public health agency for low-income patients. 
</P>
<P>
 The clinics will open in north Oxnard and central Ventura within two months, 
representing Community Memorial Hospital's first major effort to lure Medi-Cal 
patients, administrators said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're in a time of tumultuous change," hospital Executive Director Michael D. 
Bakst said. "We need to reach out to the community in this new competitive 
health care market." 
</P>
<P>
 Community Memorial still operated at a profit last year. But a cost-cutting 
trend within the health care industry meant that 43% of the hospital's beds 
were empty on average, a sharp drop that has led to elimination of about 40 
jobs, Bakst said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Bakst said that Ventura County's aggressive expansion of its 
public clinic and hospital system threatens to pull privately insured patients 
out of Community Memorial. 
</P>
<P>
 Community Memorial has already lost patients to the county hospital because of 
a 1993 change in the county's employee insurance plan, Bakst said. Nearly 1,000 
employees have opted for low-cost treatment at the county hospital and its 
clinics, officials have said. 
</P>
<P>
 Community Memorial's new clinics -- one scheduled to open by the end of the 
month and the second in early April -- are needed to make up for lost patients 
and revenue, Bakst said. The new clinics will qualify for maximum Medi-Cal 
payments because they will offer special classes and services for pregnant 
women and new mothers, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 While designed for outpatient care, the new clinics would also funnel patients 
into Community Memorial and help the hospital make greater use of its expensive 
diagnostic equipment such as CAT scanners and a $2.6-million Magnetic Resonance 
Imaging machine, Bakst said. 
</P>
<P>
 Phillip K. Wessels, head of the county Health Care Agency, said he welcomed 
Community Memorial's competition for low-income patients. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't object to the competition," Wessels said, "because competition makes 
you do a better job. And in the end, the one that provides the best services 
will be the one that captures most of the patients." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Wessels insisted that the county has no plans to compete with private 
hospitals for patients with private insurance. The county has no state license 
to run a health maintenance organization, and by law can offer health care only 
to the poor and its own employees, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is not our current plan to compete with the private sector," he said. 
"That is the perception, but that is not our intent." 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, however, Wessels hinted retaliation if Community Memorial 
takes away so many Medi-Cal patients that it financially undercuts the county 
hospital and clinics. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they're going to be successful in capturing our Medi-Cal market then we 
may have to rethink our position about the private insurance market," Wessels 
said. "We have to maintain the financial viability of our hospital." 
</P>
<P>
 For years, Community Memorial has treated relatively few Medi-Cal and indigent 
patients, which make up the bulk of those cared for at the county hospital 
three blocks away. 
</P>
<P>
 But over the last six months, Community Memorial has signed its first Medi-Cal 
contract and now has announced a two-year lease on a 3,700-square-foot clinic 
at Carriage Square in north Oxnard. A second lease on a clinic near the central 
Ventura hospital is also being negotiated, Bakst said. 
</P>
<P>
 The hospital's goals -- in addition to responding to industry change and 
replacing lost revenue -- was to fulfill its commitments to Medi-Cal to treat 
more poor patients, Bakst said. "The purpose is to assure accessibility of our 
service to Medi-Cal patients," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 Historically about 5% of Community Memorial's patients have been covered by 
Medi-Cal, whose payments are generally very low but are substantially higher 
for doctors or hospitals with large numbers of Medi-Cal patients. 
</P>
<P>
 Bakst said Medi-Cal patients will come to his hospital's new clinics "because 
it's private sector. People may prefer that as opposed to the public sector. 
It's freedom of choice." 
</P>
<P>
 Whether Ventura County really needs more private clinics serving the poor is 
questionable, Wessels said. "I don't think it's a tremendously compelling 
need," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wessels cited a new study by the California Assn. of Public Hospitals that 
shows the Ventura County Medical Center and its clinics serve a higher 
percentage of total Medi-Cal patients than any other county in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 About 77% of all Medi-Cal hospital patients in this county last year stayed at 
the county hospital, while 83% of Medi-Cal patients seen at clinics were 
treated at county facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the last four years, Ventura County has expanded its services by opening 
new public clinics operated by doctors as semi-private businesses. New 
public-private clinics have opened in Ventura, Oxnard, Santa Paula and Simi 
Valley. Another is scheduled to open soon in Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the change, outpatient visits in areas where old-styled county clinics 
existed -- Oxnard, Santa Paula and Ventura -- have more than doubled to 66,560 
a year, Wessels said. And large operating losses have been replaced by 
substantial profits, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The greatest unmet need by poor county residents could be in the La Colonia 
area of Oxnard, Wessels said. The area is within a mile of Community Memorial's 
new Oxnard clinic. 
</P>
<P>
 "We may open up another one in south Oxnard," Wessels said. "Maybe in 
Colonia."

2 MORE BOYS ARRESTED IN SHOOTING NEAR CAMPUS IN THOUSAND OAKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Ventura County sheriff's detectives arrested two more teen-agers Wednesday -- 
including one on suspicion of attempted murder -- for participating in a brawl 
near Westlake High School that led to the shooting of three students. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday's arrest of the two boys -- who were apprehended in Rowland Heights 
in Los Angeles County -- brought to four the number of teen-agers in custody 
over the melee, which has shocked the Thousand Oaks community. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest two suspects were arrested after detectives located a burgundy 
Toyota in Rowland Heights that had been seen leaving the shooting scene, 
investigators said. One of them was booked into the Ventura County juvenile 
hall on suspicion of attempted murder and the other on suspicion of assault 
with a deadly weapon. 
</P>
<P>
 Their arrests follow the brawl last Thursday in which all the suspects jumped 
out of a car at North Ranch Park and announced, "We're the Asian Mafia," before 
attacking a crowd of students with bats, lumber and gunshots, authorities say. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the two teen-agers arrested a day after the attack made their first 
appearances in Juvenile Court on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 A defense lawyer for one of those defendants told a judge that his Chinese 
American client took part in the incident because he had been racially and 
physically harassed by a Westlake football player for more than a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Police accuse the 16-year-old defendant, a Westlake High sophomore, of hitting 
the football player, junior Curtis Simmons, with a baseball bat or a piece of 
wood. 
</P>
<P>
 But defense attorney Ronald W. Stenlake suggested the defendant only hit 
Curtis with his hands. He said Curtis broke the defendant's nose in a fistfight 
six months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Stenlake also told Superior Court Judge Steven Z. Perren that this case stems 
from "some high-school jocks who picked on (the defendant) and his associates 
because they are Asian." 
</P>
<P>
 Curtis' father denied the charges Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite Stenlake's statements, the judge refused to release the boy and the 
other 16-year-old defendant from the custody of juvenile authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 Stenlake described his client as an above-average student with no previous 
criminal involvement. He is charged with assault with a deadly weapon. 
</P>
<P>
 The other 16-year-old, a Korean American who was described by his attorney as 
an average student with no history of trouble, has been charged with shooting 
at an occupied vehicle, assault with a deadly weapon and discharge of a 
firearm. 
</P>
<P>
 Both defendants were granted delays in their respective arraignments Wednesday 
so the lawyers could have more time to review police reports and other 
evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition on Wednesday, Deputy Dist. Atty. John A. Cardoza filed a petition 
that asks the court to find the boys fit to be tried as adults. Perren ordered 
probation reports prepared on both of the juveniles to help him make the 
determination on whether their cases should be sent to adult court. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge cited several reasons for not releasing the two boys into the 
custody of their parents, including the enormity of the brawl and the fact that 
the alleged attacked seemed well-organized with some of the aggressors coming 
from out of the Westlake area. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week's brawl erupted when the Chinese American boy and Curtis were to 
meet at the park to engage in a fistfight. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of the students interviewed by police describe Mr. (Curtis) Simmons as a 
bully," Stenlake said in court. 
</P>
<P>
 The defense attorney also said that Curtis is the only witness who told police 
his client had a bat. "Other evidence is that Mr. Simmons was only hit with 
(the defendant's) hands," Stenlake said. He also said that the defendant comes 
from a stable home and that his father is a self-employed business investor. 
</P>
<P>
 Curtis Simmons' father, Danny, contacted after the court hearing, acknowledged 
that Curtis broke the defendant's nose in a fight. He said it happened 13 
months ago, in January, 1993. But he also said it was the defendant who could 
not let bygones be bygones and who kept coming after his son. 
</P>
<P>
 "Did Curtis beat him up? Yeah," the father said. "Did the kid keep coming 
back? Yeah. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a little kid trying to make a name for himself. He thinks all his 
friends are going to back him up. My son doesn't want to fight this kid." 
</P>
<P>
 The father also said Curtis made a bad decision to go to North Ranch Park last 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Curtis never in his wildest dream thought there would be guns, baseball bats, 
clubs," Danny Simmons said. "If Curtis is guilty of anything, it's stupidity of 
going up there that day, instead of reporting it." 
</P>
<P>
 In court, Cardoza objected strenuously to the request to free the defendant. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is the wellspring from which the dispute emanated," said Cardoza, who 
called the incident "a virtual small-scale war." 
</P>
<P>
 In a hearing for the Korean American teen-ager, Perren ordered the boy 
detained "for his protection and for the protection of others." 
</P>
<P>
 Outside court, the teen-ager's attorney, Michael F. Yamamoto of Los Angeles, 
said the boy is depressed and worried about how his arrest is affecting his 
mother, who the attorney said has high expectations of her son. 
</P>
<P>
 "The disappointment is just crushing him," Yamamoto said of his client.

PRIEST TELLS COURT HE DID NOT TAKE $60,000; TRIAL: DAVID DEAN PIROLI, ACCUSED 
IN THE EMBEZZLEMENT CASE, TESTIFIES ON HIS OWN BEHALF FOR NEARLY SIX HOURS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Nearly two years after his arrest, a Roman Catholic priest from Simi Valley 
took the witness stand on his own behalf Wednesday to deny he embezzled $60,000 
in collection money from two Ventura County churches. 
</P>
<P>
 Father David Dean Piroli, 37, sat in the witness box in crisp white priest's 
collar and black tunic for nearly six hours, speaking in clear, measured 
phrases about the case that has scandalized his former parishes. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked by defense attorney Richard Beada if he had ever taken money for his own 
use from St. Peter Claver Church in Simi Valley or Sacred Heart Church in 
Saticoy, Piroli was adamant. 
</P>
<P>
 "No I did not," he said. "No I did not." 
</P>
<P>
 On May 29, 1992, police in Hollywood arrested Piroli on drug and embezzlement 
charges after finding him in a church car with $10,000 in cash, church 
collection envelopes, traces of cocaine and a Mexican citizen named Israel 
Palacios. 
</P>
<P>
 Five days later, church employees found another $50,000 in cash and 
parishioners' donation checks stuffed into boxes and bags in Piroli's bedroom 
and office. 
</P>
<P>
 Piroli vanished that day, June 3, and was arrested about eight weeks later at 
Calexico, driving into the United States in a newly purchased car with two 
illegal immigrants in the trunk, one of them Palacios. 
</P>
<P>
 Testifying in the third week of his grand theft trial, Piroli got a chance 
Wednesday to offer some explanations: 
</P>
<P>
 He testified he was trying to put Palacios on a plane back to his family to 
save him from drug addiction. 
</P>
<P>
 Piroli told the jury he had just taken the cocaine away from the man, and $900 
of the money under the car's floor mat was the priest's -- stashed there for 
safekeeping. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was becoming addicted to cocaine," Piroli said, describing his friend 
Palacios. "I believe the problems would not exist if he was away (from Los 
Angeles)." 
</P>
<P>
 Piroli said two cocaine-dusted matchboxes found in the car belonged to 
Palacios. The priest said he had persuaded Palacios to leave them behind. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told him to get rid of it (because) he could not go through an 
international airport with it," Piroli said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police have testified they spotted bills sticking out from under the car's 
floor mat and found hundreds of dollars more underneath. 
</P>
<P>
 But Piroli testified that he kept $900 under the Chevrolet's floor mat "for 
emergencies" because he carried no credit cards and never could be sure a bank 
would be open if he needed it. 
</P>
<P>
 But he could not explain how the rest of the cash found by police got into the 
car. 
</P>
<P>
 Piroli also testified that he kept $8,000 to $10,000 in his bedside cabinet -- 
his personal collection of silver certificates, rare currency and silver 
Kennedy half-dollars that his father had given him, along with cash gifts from 
parishioners. And he said he kept some donation checks from parishioners 
un-cashed because he believed they were too poor to spare the money. 
</P>
<P>
 But Piroli told jurors he had no idea how the rest of the collection envelopes 
and bundles of cash and checks totaling about $50,000 got into his bedroom and 
office. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked to account for the three-inch-thick layer of cash found in his underwear 
drawer by church employees, Piroli testified it was not his. "I wouldn't keep 
something dirty in with my underwear." 
</P>
<P>
 He also could not explain most of the 100 or so door and car keys that 
parishioners said they found amid the cash, though he admitted owning sets of 
keys to his parents' house and his old Toyota and a set of keys to a Santa 
Paula house given him by the parishioner who lived there. 
</P>
<P>
 That said, Beada led Piroli through a narrative of the eight weeks between his 
disappearance from St. Peter Claver Church on June 3, 1992, and his arrest at 
the U.S.-Mexico border July 31, 1992. At that time, border agents found 
Palacios and another illegal immigrant in the trunk of Piroli's just-purchased 
car. 
</P>
<P>
 Piroli told the jury he left St. Peter Claver Church in fear for his life. 
</P>
<P>
 He calmly testified that he overheard church secretary Eileen Slavin talking 
about him as he returned June 3 from Los Angeles, where he had been explaining 
his arrest to officials of the Catholic Archdiocese. Slavin has testified she 
let some air out of a tire on Piroli's church car because she feared he would 
leave with the parishioners' money. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I heard her say was, 'I fixed Father David's car so he will not make it 
back,' " Piroli testified. "Then she said, 'I guess we'll have to buy a new 
car,' and at the end of the remark about the car, there was a laugh or a 
giggle.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Despite his fears, Piroli said, he fled in the church car with only the 
clothes on his back, driving on surface streets because he believed the 
sabotage could cause him to crash on the freeways. 
</P>
<P>
 Piroli said he abandoned the church car in Burbank, where he bought another 
car for $7,000 from his mother. He then picked up Palacios and drove him to 
Ensenada, and spent seven days driving to Mexico City to reunite Palacios with 
his family, Piroli testified. 
</P>
<P>
 Piroli said Palacios' family asked him to stay with them. He said he stayed in 
a hotel for a week because there was no room in their home, but he then bought 
a bed so he could stay with the family. 
</P>
<P>
 At the end of June, Piroli said, he left the car in Mexico and traveled back 
to the San Fernando Valley briefly and stayed with his mother so he could 
discuss his case over lunch with Bishop G. Patrick Ziemann. 
</P>
<P>
 Piroli said he then returned briefly to Mexico City, traveled back to Southern 
California to buy a 1987 Mercury Sable for $4,500 and returned again to Mexico 
City to pick up Palacios. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he then drove the man back across the border at Calexico, hoping 
Palacios could help explain the arrest to Bishop Ziemann. But at that point, 
Piroli said, they were arrested at the border. 
</P>
<P>
 After about four hours' direct testimony, Piroli underwent cross-examination 
by Deputy Dist. Atty. Mary Peace. 
</P>
<P>
 Peace asked about a grocery bag containing $2,000 in cash that police in 
Hollywood found in the back seat of Piroli's church car. Piroli said he had 
never seen it before. 
</P>
<P>
 Peace quizzed him about a church employee's testimony that she saw him pulling 
collection money out of a bank bag and stuffing it into a paper sack on May 26, 
1992. Piroli replied that he was transferring it because the bank bag was full, 
there were no more bags, and the ushers needed an empty bank bag for a second 
collection that day. 
</P>
<P>
 Peace then asked, "Isn't it true that your drug of choice is crack?" 
</P>
<P>
 "No it is not," the priest replied flatly. 
</P>
<P>
 "Isn't it true you were smoking crack around two times a week at that time?" 
she asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "No it is not," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 After Beada objected and the attorneys huddled briefly with Judge Allan 
Steele, Peace continued, "Was there an occasion where Israel Palacios and you 
smoked crack and shared five 'rocks?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Piroli answered no, that there was not. 
</P>
<P>
 Under cross-examination, Piroli also admitted he had savings of nearly $20,000 
in two or three bank accounts in 1986, but he could not say whether his 10 or 
11 bank accounts at the time of his arrest held the $54,000 that Peace 
described. 
</P>
<P>
 Peace then launched into evidence of a journal entry in which Piroli wrote he 
was taught the church must be protected from scandal -- a line of questioning 
that was interrupted by the end of the court day. Testimony is to continue 
Monday morning at 10 a.m.

BOARD VOTES NOT TO CUT PAY FOR COUNTY SCHOOLS' SUPERINTENDENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAIA DAVIS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rejecting a call to cut the pay of the county schools' chief, the Ventura 
County Board of Education voted 4 to 1 Wednesday to maintain the county 
superintendent's salary at $112,466. 
</P>
<P>
 Board member Wendy Larner of Ojai had proposed that the county school board 
lop more than $14,000 off the salary of Supt. Charles Weis, reducing his pay to 
$98,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Weis, who was appointed last year to fill the unexpired term of retired Supt. 
James F. Cowan, is up for election June 7. 
</P>
<P>
 In her proposal to the board, Larner argued that a $98,000 salary would be 
high enough to attract qualified educators to run for the superintendent 
position, which is responsible for signing off on the budgets of all 21 school 
districts in Ventura County in addition to providing support services to 
individual schools and teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 "With the economic times we have right now, we could attract a good 
candidate," Larner said before the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 But trustees John McGarry and Doylenne G. Johnson said they thought a newly 
elected superintendent deserves the same salary that Cowan received. 
</P>
<P>
 After a half-hour discussion, board members Juanita Sanchez-Valdez and Albert 
Rosen consented to keeping the pay at the same level, leaving Larner as the 
lone vote to cut the superintendent's pay. 
</P>
<P>
 McGarry pointed out before Wednesday's meeting that Weis does the work of both 
the county superintendent and the assistant county superintendent, because the 
board left the assistant superintendent's position vacant after Weis was 
promoted last July. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dr. Weis since then has taken over the responsibility for both jobs," McGarry 
said. "I hardly think that that's suitable justification for reducing his pay." 
</P>
<P>
 Weis received a $32,000 raise when he was appointed to the superintendent's 
job, as his salary in the role of assistant superintendent was $80,000. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Larner was the only one of the five county school board members to vote 
against Weis' appointment last year. 
</P>
<P>
 She said, however, that her proposal to lower the pay for the superintendent's 
position was no reflection on Weis' performance. "He's been very active and 
diligent and he's been attempting to get a handle on all the schools in the 
county." 
</P>
<P>
 Larner argued that it was unfair for Weis' beginning salary as superintendent 
to be the same as the ending salary for Cowan, who served in the position 24 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 The salary for the superintendent's position has not changed since 1991-1992, 
when the board raised Cowan's pay from $110,260. 
</P>
<P>
 Trustees Sanchez-Valdez and Rosen also voiced concerns at the meeting that 
Weis could lose the election to someone who is less qualified and experienced. 
</P>
<P>
 In view of this possibility, Rosen suggested establishing a salary range for 
the position that would tie the pay level to the amount of experience of the 
officeholder. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But other officials pointed out that salaries for elective offices such as the 
county superintendent of schools are set without regard to the experience level 
of the people in those jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an elected position," McGarry said. "The position pays a certain amount 
of money regardless of who gets that position." 
</P>
<P>
 Larner also suggested that the board lower the superintendent's salary to 
reflect both the stagnation in wages in the private sector and the state budget 
crisis that has led to reductions in school funding. 
</P>
<P>
 But Weis said he believes the position is underpaid contrasted with jobs with 
similar responsibilities in private companies. 
</P>
<P>
 "We provide a service that directly affects the entire economy of Ventura 
County," Weis said, referring to the importance of public schools to the local 
economy. "So how important is that job?"

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: BANKERS WILL FACE ADDITIONAL CHARGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE FIELDS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Olen B. Phillips and Phillip L. Chase, whose banking fraud trial ended in a 
mistrial, were charged Wednesday with additional counts of filing false loan 
applications. 
</P>
<P>
 The indictment by a federal grand jury in Los Angeles accuses the two men of 
understating their debts when applying for loans from banks in Los Angeles and 
Ventura counties. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to those allegations, Phillips, 53, and Chase, 51, are scheduled 
to be retried March 1 on charges of defrauding state regulators by loaning 
money back to themselves in an attempt to keep their failing Thousand Oaks bank 
afloat. 
</P>
<P>
 In December, jurors deadlocked over eight counts in the government fraud case 
and acquitted Chase on one count of filing false documents. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant U.S. Atty. Brent Whittlesey said the additional charges came as a 
result of an investigation conducted by FBI agents since the mistrial. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the indictment filed in U.S. District Court, Chase allegedly 
filed false financial statements in seeking loans from a Bank of A. Levy branch 
in Ventura County and from Community Bank in Pasadena in 1988 and 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 In those applications, Chase understated his debts by $1.2 million to $4.9 
million, according to a source familiar with the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Phillips of Oak View allegedly filed false statements in applying for loans 
from County Savings Bank and Charter Pacific Bank, both in Ventura County, and 
to Community Bank in Pasadena, the indictment said. 
</P>
<P>
 He understated his liabilities by $750,000 to $1.4 million, the source said. 
</P>
<P>
 United Community Bank of Thousand Oaks, of which Chase was the chairman and 
Phillips a board member, was shut down for lack of funds in 1989, and has since 
cost taxpayers $9.5 million to cover federally insured accounts, prosecutors 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Marmaro, Chase's attorney, called the new indictment "a vindictive 
move by the prosecutor who was disappointed that a majority of the jury on the 
first trial believed my client to be innocent." JULIE FIELDS

<P>
 A Municipal Court judge on Wednesday ordered an Oxnard man to stand trial on 
murder charges related to the Christmas Day stabbing of his ex-girlfriend's 
son. 
</P>
<P>
 Jose Socorro Jimenez, 32, will be arraigned in Superior Court on Feb. 23, said 
Senior Deputy Dist. Atty.Peter D. Kossoris. 
</P>
<P>
 He is accused of stabbing 21-year-old Isaias Guerrero after showing up at the 
home of the victim on Campbell Way in Oxnard about 3 a.m. Dec. 25. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the stabbing, the victim had tried to escort Jimenez off the family's 
property, witnesses said. Jimenez had come to the house and smashed his hand 
against a living-room window. 
</P>
<P>
 He yelled that the victim's mother, 36-year-old Garciela Guerrero, was going 
to pay for breaking off their three-year relationship. DWAYNE BRAY

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: MOORPARK; VOLUNTEERS ARE SOUGHT FOR SENIOR CENTER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Hoping to expand the programs at its Senior Center, the city of Moorpark is 
seeking volunteers interested in working at the Moorpark Avenue facility. 
</P>
<P>
 "Volunteerism does make that place vital and active and makes it possible for 
them to do as many events as they do," Mayor Paul Lawrason said Tuesday. "They 
really do have a full schedule of activities over there. I mean, every day they 
have something going on." 
</P>
<P>
 Center coordinator Carol Ghens said she is looking for people willing to 
perform a wide variety of tasks, from manning the front desk to playing piano 
at lunch or visiting homebound senior citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will train and try to prepare each volunteer to be the best that they can 
be," Ghens said. "They can just call and say, 'I want to help, but I'm not sure 
what I want to do,' and we'll talk about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Residents who have a particular interest -- such as dancing, music or art -- 
can also volunteer to help establish a club or group at the center devoted to 
the activity. 
</P>
<P>
 There are about 100 active volunteers now working with the seniors, but more 
are needed, Ghens said. 
</P>
<P>
 "A number of them only help at a certain time or a certain month, I need 
someone at the front desk all week and I don't have that and it's only a 
one-morning or one-afternoon commitment," Ghens said. 
</P>
<P>
 Working the front desk Tuesday was volunteer Dan Diasio, 80, a Moorpark 
resident who has been filling an afternoon shift answering phones once a week 
while his wife, Bernice, helps prepare the center's monthly newsletter. 
</P>
<P>
 "I enjoy the work and I feel like I'm doing something good for the seniors," 
Diasio said. "I feel that everybody owes something," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 For more information or to volunteer at the center, call Ghens on weekdays 
between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., at 529-6864, Ext. 261. JAMES MAIELLA JR.

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; FORMER HIGH SCHOOL COACH LEAVES PRISON 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Former Ventura High School football coach Harvey Kochel was released from 
prison Saturday after serving one year of a two-year sentence for having a 
nine-month sexual relationship with a 15-year-old student, a Department of 
Corrections spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kochel was released on good behavior from the Avenal State Prison in Kings 
County, said Art Flores, a Ventura parole supervisor for the Department of 
Corrections. 
</P>
<P>
 Kochel must register as a sex offender as part of his three-year parole, 
Flores said. His parole officer is in Oxnard, Flores added. 
</P>
<P>
 Kochel, Ventura High's most successful football coach, was sentenced last year 
after pleading guilty to having sex with a girl enrolled in his health class. 
After his conviction his teaching license was permanently revoked by the state. 
 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney Louis Samonsky, who defended Kochel during his trial, said he did not 
know what Kochel plans to do for a living or where he plans to live. SCOTT

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OJAI; CHILD-CARE FACILITY GETS PRELIMINARY OK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A proposal to establish a before- and after-school child-care facility in a 
portable classroom in Ojai has met preliminary approval by the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan would use a combination of city funds and school facilities to 
establish the center at Topa Topa Elementary School.The project must now be 
approved by the Ojai Unified School District trustees. 
</P>
<P>
 "We saw a lot of children who were not being taken care of after school," said 
Dana Huffman of Smart Start, the nonprofit agency that would operate the 
center. "There is a need for additional child care in the Ojai Valley." 
</P>
<P>
 Several people spoke in favor of establishing the center during a public 
meeting Tuesday night of the Ojai City Council. But resident Ben Larner said 
tax dollars should not be used to fund nonprofit agencies and that the rates 
proposed by Smart Start were excessive. 
</P>
<P>
 Child care would cost between $175 and $223 a month under the plan submitted 
by Huffman. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council, however, sitting as the Ojai Redevelopment Agency, endorsed 
the project unanimously. 
</P>
<P>
 "It really opens up cooperation between the city and the school district," 
said Councilman Joe De Vito, who noted the city spent $3,500 to print a 
brochure explaining the recently adopted smoking ordinance for merchants to 
distribute. 
</P>
<P>
 "For us to support our business community and not do something to support the 
children, I think would be a sin," De Vito said. 
</P>
<P>
 The city would spend up to $21,500 to help get the program established under 
the proposal. JEFF McDONALD

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; LOW-INCOME HOUSING ALLOTMENT CRITICIZED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK McCARTNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Advocates for Oxnard's working poor have accused the City Council of failing 
to provide enough low-income housing in the sprawling Northeast Community 
Specific Plan. 
</P>
<P>
 The council unanimously approved plans for the 737-acre area Tuesday, 
culminating nearly 10 years of planning.The Specific Plan -- the blueprint for 
future development in that area -- calls for the creation of two residential 
neighborhoods on 500 acres, 107 acres of commercial and industrial uses and 
three new schools. 
</P>
<P>
 City planners had previously identified the 737-acre Northeast Community as 
the city's best chance for meeting the existing need for low-income housing. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, critics Tuesday said the plan -- which requires only 170 of 3,400 housing 
units to be built for lower-income residents -- does not address the current 
shortage of affordable housing, let alone account for future needs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since 1989, only 1% of Oxnard's housing has been built for low-income 
residents, even though two-thirds of the city's residents have low or very low 
incomes," said Barbara Macri-Ortiz, an attorney with Channel Counties Legal 
Services Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's General Plan calls for the construction of 850 units of 
lower-income housing during a five-year period that ends this year. Only 22 
units have been built in the last four years, Macri-Ortiz said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to make a serious and substantial commitment to affordable housing," 
Macri-Ortiz said. "The issue is not going to go away." 
</P>
<P>
 City planners responded by saying the plan gives the city the flexibility to 
waive fees and change design guidelines to encourage affordable housing.

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OJAI; COUNCIL JOINS IN URGING TOWER DELAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Ojai City Council joined the Ventura County Board of Supervisors and key 
federal lawmakers in asking the government to delay turning on a microwave 
radar tower because they fear it will cause cancer or other diseases. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members voted unanimously to adopt a resolution urging the National 
Weather Service to postpone switching on the weather-tracking system until more 
studies on its health effects can be completed. 
</P>
<P>
 More than a dozen residents of the area packed the council chambers late 
Tuesday to urge the council to pass the resolution, which mirrors another 
resolution passed by county supervisors last week. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no question in my mind that we should pass the resolution," 
Councilwoman Nina V. Shelley said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 98-foot weather station is scheduled to be turned on by Friday for initial 
tests, but will not be operable for several weeks, said Jerry McDuffie, who 
runs the Oxnard office of the National Weather Service. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe by the end of the month or the first of March we'll start getting some 
usable data," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, plaintiffs suing the federal government over the tower said 
Wednesday they are not yet ready to appeal a ruling last week by a federal 
judge, who refused to issue an injunction stopping the project until further 
studies are performed. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're getting a number of legal opinions," plaintiff David Hedman said 
Wednesday.  
</P>
<P>
 "Based on the recommendation of the attorneys, we'll make a decision in the 
next few days," he said. JEFF McDONALD

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; CITY TO ACQUIRE LAND WITH GAS-TAX 
FUNDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Formalizing a long-awaited land deal, the Thousand Oaks City Council has 
agreed to spend $605,000 from the gas-tax fund to purchase Robert Heggen's 
parcel adjacent to the Civic Arts Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
 Heggen's home will be razed and his construction business relocated to make 
room for the city to widen Oakwood Drive.Once broadened, the street will serve 
as a primary entrance into the performing arts and government center. 
</P>
<P>
 Because much of the parcel will be converted into a street, Finance Director 
Robert Biery recommended paying for Heggen's land with money collected from the 
gas tax. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Elois Zeanah objected, arguing that gas-tax money should be used for 
street maintenance and construction elsewhere in the city. She suggested that 
the city find another fund to pay for the Heggen parcel. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just not right, in my view," Zeanah said. "Every time we take money from 
other accounts and put it in the Civic Arts Plaza budget, we are taking 
services from the community at large." 
</P>
<P>
 Zeanah's argument, however, did not persuade her colleagues, and the council 
voted 3 to 1 to OK the purchase with gas-tax funds.

 Councilman Alex Fiore was not present. STEPHANIE SIMON

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: GANG PROBATIONERS FOCUS OF POLICE SWEEP

<TEXT>
<P>
 Simi Valley police this week paid early morning visits to 14 gang members and 
associates who are on probation, and found that 12 were violating their 
agreements with the court. 
</P>
<P>
 Violations included possession of drugs, drug paraphernalia, graffiti 
instruments, gang graffiti and other items, said Simi Valley Police Lt. Jon 
Ainsworth.In one case, a probationer was found in possession of baggy pants 
that he had agreed not to wear because they symbolize gang involvement, 
Ainsworth said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County probation officers accompanied Simi Valley officers on the 
Tuesday sweep and will evaluate the items found to determine whether to alter 
the probation conditions of those in violation or pursue further legal action 
against them. 
</P>
<P>
 Ainsworth, who heads the department's Special Enforcement Detail, said the 
periodic sweeps are a way to crack down on gang activity. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to periodically remind them that we know who they are and we know 
where they are," Ainsworth said. "The effect of showing up at any time reminds 
them that we are paying attention to their presence in the community, their 
gang involvement and their status as a probationer." JAMES MAIELLA JR.

MALIBU'S MANTRA: SANDBAG, SANDBAG, SANDBAG; ENVIRONMENT: BELEAGUERED RESIDENTS 
SCRAMBLE TO SHORE UP HOMES AGAINST POSSIBLE SUNDAY STORM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 As Malibu residents dug out of mud-filled homes, forecasts for a weekend storm 
sent residents beleaguered by Monday's cascade scrambling to shore up homes 
against more mudslides. 
</P>
<P>
 Sandbag, sandbag, sandbag -- it's been the city's mantra since the November 
wildfires stripped vegetation from hillsides, leaving property vulnerable to 
mudslides. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're talking to people who are frantic about the Sunday storm," said Sarah 
Maurice, spokeswoman for the city of Malibu. "They are saying, 'Can't you stop 
it -- the storm and the mudflows?' It's gonna happen. We've been telling them 
to prepare." 
</P>
<P>
 Maurice, who was nicknamed "bag lady" for her work directing sandbagging, said 
free sandbags from the city's supply of 15,000 are available at Malibu fire 
stations. Engineers from the Los Angeles County Flood Control District are 
being sent to instruct residents on proper placement. 
</P>
<P>
 The sandbags, however, are not foolproof. Soggy barriers at numerous houses 
along Pacific Coast Highway were overwhelmed by the mudflows. 
</P>
<P>
 With volunteers tapped out from the fires and the Jan. 17 earthquake, Malibu's 
Community Disaster Recovery and Preparedness Center was operating with a dearth 
of assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 That, in part, prompted the city to dispatch temporary laborers to residences 
for help digging out. By Wednesday most of the houses along Pacific Coast 
Highway that had been socked in by mud were cleaned up and fortified with 
sandbags. 
</P>
<P>
 But not all Malibu residents heeded the city's words to the wise. 
</P>
<P>
 The house of Stella Bacich, a 20-year oceanfront resident, looked 
conspicuously unprotected. 
</P>
<P>
 "What stops (the mud)?" asked Bacich, who views sandbags as a kind of false 
hope. "It's all Mother Nature. You can't do anything about it. 
</P>
<P>
 Public Works Director John Clement said city employees and others are working 
around the clock to clear huge accumulations of sediment, rocks and dead 
vegetation from the system of storm drains, culverts, dams and racks erected to 
catch debris. The system stopped much of the debris but was overwhelmed by the 
enormity of the flow, which pummeled at least 24 houses on Pacific Coast 
Highway and severely damaged one home in lower Las Flores Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't know how much more mud could come down again," said Clement. "You 
still look up in the hillsides at Tuna Canyon and Big Rock and there is a lot 
of black soil. So it is hard to determine how much more hydrophobic soil is 
still there." 
</P>
<P>
 Hydrophobic soil is a non-porous layer two to six inches below the surface 
that is produced from gases and oils of burned chaparral. When it rains, water 
runs off the surface instead of being absorbed, creating mudslides and debris 
flows. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a little more than an inch of rain (Monday), so if it comes down like 
it did, then we are going to have mudslides again," Clement said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tired but unbowed, city officials say they are ready. City Manager David 
Carmany said long-term plans for stopping the slides and preventing fires are 
being discussed. A study on fire-ravaged Las Flores Canyon is under way, along 
with an attempt to get funding to safeguard fire- and flood-prone areas through 
special disaster recovery legislation that Assemblyman Terry B. Friedman 
(D-Brentwood) plans to sponsor. 
</P>
<P>
 Malibu is also studying geographically similar communities for answers to 
problems with its storm drains and water system, which failed during the 
wildfires. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd like to think we can do something to preempt (mudslides)," Carmany said. 
"We don't know what kind of long-term solutions are out there yet." 
</P>
<P>
 If the mudslides continue on a grand scale, Carmany said the city would ask 
for assistance from the Navy's 91st U.S. Construction Battalion, known as 
Seabees. The Seabees, akin to the Army Corps of Engineers, in just two days 
rebuilt a burned bridge over Las Flores Creek after the fires, Carmany said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, life in Malibu took on some signs of normalcy Wednesday. 
Spandex-clad women jogged past mud-splattered residents still cleaning up. 
Cosentino's Nursery, fully recovered from the mud that filled it at the bottom 
of Las Flores Canyon on Pacific Coast Highway, was open and getting ready for 
its biggest day of the year: Valentine's Day.

GIRLFRIEND OF SINGER RICK JAMES GETS SENTENCE REDUCED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOM MROZEK, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A judge has reduced from four years to two the prison sentence imposed on the 
girlfriend of funk singer Rick James for assaulting a woman during a drug party 
in West Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Nuys Superior Court Judge Michael R. Hoff said he reluctantly reduced the 
term because James himself, although he had been found guilty of more serious 
offenses than his girlfriend, probably will be released this fall following 
treatment in a drug rehabilitation program. 
</P>
<P>
 James' light sentence and the reduction in the term of Tanya Anne Hijazi, 23, 
come in the wake of an investigation into what sources close to the case said 
are allegations of misconduct by an investigator in the district attorney's 
office. The investigator was not assigned to the James case but he is under 
scrutiny because he allegedly had provided drugs to one of the witnesses who 
testified against the singer. 
</P>
<P>
 James, best known for the 1981 hit "Super Freak," was convicted Sept. 17 of 
assaulting and imprisoning Mary Sauger, 35, at the St. James Club & Hotel on 
the Sunset Strip in 1992. James was acquitted on several charges, although the 
jury deadlocked 11 to 1 in favor of a guilty verdict on six other charges, 
including torture. 
</P>
<P>
 Hijazi pleaded guilty to assault on the day she and James were to go on trial 
and was sentenced to four years in prison. In exchange for her plea, 
prosecutors dropped a dozen other charges that carried a potential life 
sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of a sentencing deal that sent him to a drug treatment program instead 
of prison, James also pleaded guilty to assaulting a second woman at his 
Hollywood Hills home in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors, saying they had a case fraught with difficulties and that the two 
victims did not want to testify again, agreed to the sentencing deal under 
which James is expected to be freed this year -- even though he faced the 
possibility of life in prison if he were convicted in a second trial on charges 
the jury was unable to resolve. 
</P>
<P>
 Leonard B. Levine, Hijazi's attorney, said that under the new sentence, he 
hopes to see her released in August. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge sentenced James last month to five years and four months in prison, 
but the term was stayed when he was admitted to the California Rehabilitation 
Center in Norco. If James successfully completes the 8 1/2-month treatment 
program, he will be released on parole. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoff said recent events in the case have shown him "the best of times and the 
worst of times." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very troubled by this entire case, and in particular the recent events 
which have brought us here," Hoff said. 
</P>
<P>
 The district attorney is probing the possibility that an investigator provided 
drugs to Michelle Allen, one of three women who testified against James, 
according to sources close to the case. Allen, who was in custody on theft 
charges and was not named as a victim, testified to bolster the prosecution's 
contention that James chronically abused women. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoff said he was also disappointed that a gag order he issued to protect the 
investigation has been violated, leading to news accounts of the alleged 
misconduct. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge made it clear that the prosecutor in the case, Deputy Dist. Atty. 
Andrew Flier, acted with a "high degree of personal integrity and honesty" and 
in no way was accused of misconduct. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the case has now been tainted by the investigation, Hoff reminded 
everyone that in "the simplest terms, this case is about cocaine, abuse and 
assaultive behavior toward women." 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorney Levine characterized Hijazi as a victim who also received 
beatings from James. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm glad that she's not going to be incarcerated longer than Rick," said 
Hijazi's mother, Susanne Shapiro. "I think the judge was very fair," she said. 
"It gives me a little more faith in the criminal justice system."

POLITICS; 11 RUN FOR WEST HOLLYWOOD COUNCIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEN ELLINGWOOD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This much we know: There will be at least one new face on the West Hollywood 
City Council this spring. 
</P>
<P>
 Three seats are up for grabs on April 12 and only two incumbents are running, 
guaranteeing that at least one of the nine challengers--all of them gay 
men--will win. That means the city, whose large homosexual population often 
steers clear of local politics, could end up with its first gay council 
majority since 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney John Heilman, the only gay member of the five-person council, is 
seeking reelection, along with councilman Sal Guarriello, the only heterosexual 
and only senior citizen in the field of 11. Councilwoman Babette Lang decided 
not to run for a second four-year term. 
</P>
<P>
 Heilman, a member since cityhood in 1984, is a key architect and in many ways 
the embodiment of West Hollywood's liberal ethos, which revolves around rent 
control and broad social programs for senior citizens and people with AIDS. 
Heilman has won strong support from the Coalition for Economic Survival, the 
renters rights group that tends to dominate city elections.  
</P>
<P>
 Guarriello, a blunt-talking retiree elected in 1990, is known for his 
lone-wolf battles with City Hall administrators and the Heilman-led council 
majority. He scraped together enough votes to kill a proposed utility tax and 
derail a business levy last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Two attorneys who are well known around City Hall are widely seen as the 
strongest challengers: Steve Martin, a member of the city's rent board who 
narrowly lost a council bid in 1990, and Jeff Richmond, chairman of the city's 
Planning Commission who is running a joint campaign with Heilman. 
</P>
<P>
 Other candidates are running as outsiders. Business activist Michael W. 
Radcliffe, a retired store owner who often butts heads with City Hall, recently 
moved into the city from just across the border in Los Angeles in order to run. 
Timothy P. Olson, the development director for an AIDS group, is also leading a 
renewed ballot effort to create an independent city police department. The 
measure failed at the polls in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The other candidates are: Christopher Patrouch, a former city transportation 
staffer who co-founded West Hollywood's Institute for Gay and Lesbian 
Education; Steven S. Chapman, an investor and writer; Burton Cutler, a 
transportation consultant; Christopher S. Dietrich, a legal clerk and writer, 
and Daniel J. Kovatch, an insurance sales supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
 In a city that is famous for its quirky politics, the issues mentioned most 
often are remarkably down to earth: crime, parking and city spending. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Although officials say crime has dropped slightly in the last three years, 
challengers say it has reached a frightening level, particularly on the east 
end of the city. Several said the city needs to spend more than the $8.5 
million called for in its contract with the Los Angeles County Sheriff's 
Department to put more police on the street. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're really talking about people who are afraid," said Martin, a leader of 
the successful effort to maintain the Sheriff's Department patrols instead of 
setting up a city police department. Olson hopes to recapture votes by the 
police department supporters for his council bid. Initiative backers plan to 
put the measure to another vote by fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Most leading candidates are cool to the idea of a city police force, saying it 
would cost too much. The city has ordered a study to compare costs of a city 
department and the Sheriff's Department contract. 
</P>
<P>
 Richmond described himself as "a stay-the-course candidate" who nevertheless 
will seek more attention for his often-overlooked east-end neighborhood. A 
residents group has banded together to demand more patrols against street 
hustlers and drug dealers. 
</P>
<P>
 Radcliffe, who heads the West Hollywood Community Alliance, accused the city 
of being hostile toward business. Patrouch, a storekeeper, urged finding ways 
to reduce traffic instead of creating parking places, saying that streets are 
already clogged. 
</P>
<P>
 Dietrich and Cutler labeled crime and gay-bashing as their top concerns, while 
Kovatch said he worried too many gay-owned businesses are leaving town. Chapman 
could not be reached by telephone. The Candidates 03,25,05,32 NAME AGE

BRIEFLY: EDUCATION: POETRY SCHOLAR APPOINTED HUMANITIES DEAN AT UCLA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Pauline Yu, a renowned scholar of Chinese poetry, has been appointed dean of 
the humanities at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 Yu's appointment comes as the university's departments and programs in the 
humanities face budget cuts of $1.4 million, or 5.2%. 
</P>
<P>
 With the cutbacks, Yu said, "it becomes particularly important to defend the 
value of studying literature, language, philosophy, the arts of other cultures, 
for their own sake and for the crucial exposure to modes of analysis, judgment 
and expression they provide." 
</P>
<P>
 Yu studied French and German history and literature at Harvard University 
before attending Stanford University, where in 1976 she earned a doctorate 
degree in comparative literature. 
</P>
<P>
 She went on to teach at the University of Minnesota and Columbia University 
before joining UC Irvine three years ago and founding the East Asian languages 
and literature department.

COMMUNITY NEWS: WEST LOS ANGELES: FLORIDA PUPILS GIVE QUAKE AID TO SCHOOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Crescent Heights Elementary School has received a donation to repair damage 
sustained in the Northridge quake: $500 raised by Florida elementary school 
pupils through lunch money, allowances and piggy banks. 
</P>
<P>
 The gift was delivered last week by Donna Fischbach, an assistant principal at 
Tampa's Claywell Elementary School, which has fresh memories of what was 
previously the nation's costliest disaster -- Hurricane Andrew. Fischbach said 
her students collected canned goods for hurricane refugees, who were evacuated 
to the region from Dade County. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Crescent Heights Elementary has received $2,500 in federal aid for 
repairs, the recent donation was appreciated by the staff and 255 students in 
fourth through sixth grades. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even though it's small, it's very special to us because it's made up of gifts 
from children to children," said Marie Kendricks, Crescent Elementary's 
principal. The money will be used to replace cracked lighting, broken ceiling 
tiles and damaged instructional materials, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kaci Groh, a third-grader at Claywell Elementary, came up with the idea to 
make donations after seeing television footage of a man whose roof had 
collapsed. Within two weeks she amassed the funds by setting up a donation 
stand at the school, visiting the school's 35 classrooms and issuing a plea for 
money on the school's closed-circuit television channel. 
</P>
<P>
 Fischbach decided to hand-deliver the check while visiting a relative in Los 
Angeles. She toured Crescent Elementary classrooms and was presented with a 
"school-to-school" plaque and a trophy for Groh with the inscription: "Kaci 
Groh -- you're our hero." 
</P>
<P>
 Fischbach said her students learned many lessons. 
</P>
<P>
 "Reading and writing (are) important, but we also enroll our students in a 
daily 15-minute 'positive action program' that encourages help for others," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The recent gift made an impression on many students. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was excited another school from another state would care about us," said 
Raasean Robinson, a sixth-grader. "Next time there's a disaster at some other 
school, I hope to make my own donation." ADRIAN MAHER

CITY HALL ROUNDUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 SANTA MONICA 
</P>
<P>
 A referendum on the plan to renovate the Santa Monica Civic Center area has 
easily qualified for the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 City Clerk Clarice Dykhouse told the City Council on Tuesday night that 
opponents of the plan gathered 6,557 valid signatures, more than 1,000 more 
than the 5,466 needed to put the matter before voters. The signatures were 
validated by the county registrar of voters last week. 
</P>
<P>
 The council will decide early next month whether to put the matter on the June 
or November ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 The Civic Center plan, more than four years in the making, aims to turn an 
area now mostly covered by parking into a more usable space, with parks, 
walkways and other amenities. It also would allow the biggest private landowner 
in the area, the RAND Corp., to expand its headquarters and develop the rest of 
its property for commercial and residential uses. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents of the plan say it will bring too much traffic and pollution to the 
area. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 City Manager John Jalili told the City Council on Tuesday that the number of 
uninhabitable buildings in the city has been cut in half since the first days 
after the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 There are still about 1,800 housing units that remain condemned because of 
damage sustained in the Jan. 17 quake. Jalili also said about 2,300 jobs have

COMMUNITY NEWS: VENICE: ACTIVISTS MARCH IN PLEA FOR TRUCE AMONG GANGS IN AREA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 About 50 activists marched through the community last weekend to ask area 
gangs to stop a bloody rivalry that has killed 11 people and wounded 30 others 
in the past four months. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the Brown Berets, the Coalition Against Police Abuse and an 
incense-bearing Mayan spiritualist were among activists who took their message 
of peace to the streets of the Oakwood section on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to let these guys know that the community supports the need for 
a truce," said Michael Zinzun, a longtime political activist. "That's why we're 
putting ourselves on the line right now." 
</P>
<P>
 Many hard-core gang members, however, did not attend the rally. Some residents 
were skeptical of the activists, many of whom were from outside the area. 
</P>
<P>
 "The kids who should be out here are not out here," said resident Lupe 
Gonzalez, 48. "We don't need anyone to come into our community and tell us what 
our problem is."

THE FINE ART OF MAKING FRIENDS; MUSEUMS ARE REACING OUT TO ENSURE THAT ETHNIC 
VISITORS FEEL WELCOME. THE EFFORTS ARE STARTING TO PAY DIVIDENDS AND WIN 
PLAUDITS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Lucia Diaz, director of the Mar Vista Family Center, remembers the uneasiness 
many of her families felt before their first visit to the J. Paul Getty Museum. 
</P>
<P>
 The center serves mostly low-income Latino and African American clients, and 
few had been to the Getty, although it is free and less than 20 miles away in 
Malibu. As Diaz recalled, one older woman, a native of Mexico who rarely 
ventured out of her neighborhood, was particularly apprehensive, fearful that 
she wouldn't be welcome because of her limited education and inability to speak 
English. The woman's heart sank when she stepped off the bus and onto the 
sumptuous grounds. Although the museum, a handsome replica of an ancient Roman 
villa, beckoned, the woman was sure she would be perceived as out of place. 
</P>
<P>
 But the woman's fears were allayed at the door. She and the rest of the Mar 
Vista group were greeted by Getty staff members and offered tours in English or 
Spanish. Fascinated by what she saw and heard on the tour, the woman said later 
that she would like to bring her grown children with her when she visited next. 
</P>
<P>
 The Getty has become one of the favorite destinations of Mar Vista Center 
families, Diaz said. "They make you feel you're in a safe place." 
</P>
<P>
 More and more museums are doing what the Getty is trying to do: open their 
doors to a more diverse population. To accomplish that, museums have had to 
confront -- and try to change -- the perception that they are elitist 
institutions, with little or no interest in visitors who aren't well-educated, 
wealthy and white. Their efforts to reach out include everything from bilingual 
signage to forging ongoing relationships with community groups. And despite 
hard economic times, many Westside museums, including the Los Angeles County 
Museum of Art and the George C. Page Museum at the La Brea tar pits, seem to be 
succeeding, as evidenced by small but real gains in attendance by minorities. 
</P>
<P>
 Local museums say they cannot wait until their staffs are more multicultural 
-- a stated goal of the Getty and others -- to attract new groups. "It's a 
matter of fairness for me," said Getty director John Walsh. "We're doing it out 
of a sense that we're not being as effective with our population as we could 
be. We're missing chances to change lives." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 No local museum has been more ambitious than the Getty in its efforts to 
democratize. In a 1988 survey, the overwhelming majority of Getty-goers -- 89% 
-- identified themselves as white. Subsequent studies looked at what kept 
people away from the museum and revealed that many, whatever their ethnicity, 
thought the museum was geographically remote, stuffy and inhospitable to 
children. They also found the museum's parking reservation system hard to 
understand. 
</P>
<P>
 Some public perceptions stunned the staff. "Because our name is Getty, some 
people thought we might be an oil museum," recalled Barbara Whitney, the 
museum's associate director for administration and public affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Also surprising was the notion that the museum, which abuts Pacific Palisades, 
was in a remote area of Malibu. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As step one in the process of widening its audience, the Getty decided to 
focus on Los Angeles's large Latino community. Some ways of attracting more 
Latinos were obvious. Three years ago the museum introduced a Spanish-language 
telephone information line and it has hired more Spanish-speaking reservation 
agents. But, as Starr said, other strategies for change emerged only "when we 
began to listen to what people wanted instead of what we thought they wanted." 
</P>
<P>
 Providing educational experiences for their families was a major goal of 
Latinos interviewed in depth in 1992. Whether they were longtime residents 
fluent in English or recent immigrants who spoke mostly Spanish, many said they 
would very much like to visit an art museum that offered family-oriented 
educational activities. 
</P>
<P>
 Mindful of the perception that children weren't welcome, the Getty became more 
family-friendly on several fronts. A public service announcement was filmed, 
featuring an African American schoolgirl describing the Getty as free and fun. 
It began running in 1990 on local TV stations at cartoon time. Highchairs were 
ordered for the restaurant and a peanut-butter-and-jelly sandwich (with 
beverage and chips for a relatively inexpensive $1.95) was added to the menu. 
</P>
<P>
 The museum also decided to recruit children as allies in its effort. More than 
25,000 schoolchildren from the 90-plus ethnic backgrounds represented in Los 
Angeles come to the museum every year for staff-taught programs or to tour with 
their teachers. For several months in 1992 each student visitor was given a 
postcard as a keepsake. On one side was a photo of "Irises," the famed Van Gogh 
painting for which the museum paid between $50 million and $60 million in 1987. 
On the other side, in both English and Spanish, was an invitation to the child 
to come back with his or her parents -- no reservation required. Five percent 
returned with parents in tow. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992 the museum drew larger-than-average Latino audiences to two exhibits. 
For "The Passion of Christ in Renaissance Manuscripts," the Getty sent 
announcement flyers to predominantly Latino churches, in addition to alerting 
the Spanish-language media. For a show of photographs by Mexican artist Manuel 
Alvarez Bravo, the exhibit labels were written in Spanish as well as English. 
In surveys conducted at both shows, 12% of the visitors identified themselves 
as Latino, twice the percentage of Latino visitors during 1991 and three times 
as many as in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 The survey also revealed that Latino visitors felt good about the Spanish 
labels, no matter how fluently they spoke English. One wrote, in English: "I 
enjoyed the fact the Museum exhibits Mexican art and cared enough to (label) it 
in both languages." Only 4% of the visitors said they read only the Spanish 
labels. 
</P>
<P>
 Steven D. Lavine, president of the California Institute of the Arts in 
Valencia, said such efforts are part of a larger trend. 
</P>
<P>
 "Museums are making very serious efforts to broaden their constituencies," he 
said. "It starts with what you put in your museum." 
</P>
<P>
 But to achieve real diversity, more needs to be done. As important as ethnic 
programming is, the real test is "whom you show genuine respect for," Lavine 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 One reflection of that respect is who is involved in decision-making: A number 
of local museums, including the Los Angeles County Museum of Art and the 
Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County, have multicultural advisory 
boards. Bilingual brochures are among the crucial gestures that make a museum 
less forbidding to new audiences, but they are only a beginning, Lavine says. 
"You have to realize it's going to take years." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Somewhat surprisingly, many museum officials said they don't need pots of 
money to make new groups feel more welcome. And it's a good thing, too, 
because, unlike the Getty, most local museums are severely underfinanced. 
</P>
<P>
 Largely supported by the county, the George C. Page Museum of La Brea 
Discoveries in Hancock Park has suffered major staff reductions and other 
economic woes in recent years. But even the Page has become more multicultural, 
according to Catherine Krell, deputy director for marketing and public affairs 
for the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County, the Page's parent 
institution. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past five years African American visitors have doubled to a still 
modest 3%, while Latino attendance has quadrupled to 8%. The number of visitors 
identifying themselves as Asian or Pacific Islander has grown from 1% to 6%, 
Krell said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Page lacks funds for a full-scale study, visitors were recently 
asked, in English or Spanish, what they liked and disliked about the museum. 
Many said they wished gift-shop souvenirs were less pricey. As a result, the 
shop now stocks more items that cost $2.50 or less. A hot seller is a pencil, 
black as the asphalt that bubbles in the tar pits, that features the museum's 
sabertooth logo. Young visitors snap up 50 to 100 every day at 50 cents apiece. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles County Museum of Art is also trying to diversify despite 
serious financial woes. According to Jane Burrell, head of education, most of 
the museum's multicultural programs are related to specific exhibits or 
collections. In November, LACMA will open a major show of Jain sculpture and 
painting. The museum has identified a school in Buena Park with a large number 
of students who practice this form of Hinduism. LACMA will bring in the 
students and their non-Jain classmates for special tours. 
</P>
<P>
 Maintaining relationships is an essential part of audience-building, according 
to Burrell. "You can't reach out to a community that is not your usual 
community one time and expect them to continue to come," she said. LACMA has 
had a multicultural advisory board since 1988. And when an exhibit excites an 
ethnic community, the museum tries to build on that success. Last summer there 
was a strong African American turnout for an exhibit of paintings by black 
artist Jacob Lawrence. A show of prints by African American artist Romare 
Bearden opens July 14. 
</P>
<P>
 The museum also plans an ambitious program in connection with this summer's 
exhibit of 18th-Century Korean Folk and Court Art. Libraries and community 
centers throughout the city will be the site of hands-on art activities for 
children, featuring such skills as Korean pottery techniques. Included will be 
neighborhoods that have experienced tension between African Americans and 
Koreans. Free transportation to the exhibit and free admission will be offered 
to all participants and their extended families. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Enthusiastic volunteers or the above-and-beyond efforts of staffers are what 
make some outreach programs possible. Maritza Galdamez is the busy secretary in 
LACMA's education department. But she has taken it upon herself to ensure that 
every Spanish-language news outlet in the Southland knows about such LACMA 
activities as next month's exhibition of work by Chicano artist Gronk, a native 
of Los Angeles. She also reviews the translation of museum materials into 
Spanish, such as an information sheet about animals in Asian art.  
</P>
<P>
 One museum has a head start when it comes to multicultural appeal -- the UCLA 
Fowler Museum of Cultural History. Founded in 1963, the museum contains 
cultural materials from around the world, including major collections from 
Africa, the Americas, Asia and Oceania. As Fowler deputy director Doran Ross 
explained, "We've been dealing with most of the planet, except Western Europe, 
since the beginning." 
</P>
<P>
 The museum opened in new quarters on the Westwood campus in 1992. Last year it 
held its most successful exhibit to date, a show of pre-Incan treasures from 
Peru called "The Royal Tombs of Sipan." 
</P>
<P>
 According to Ross, the museum made a special effort to make Latino Los Angeles 
aware of the show by hanging banners in English, Spanish or both over selected 
streets. Stories related to the exhibit were pitched to the Spanish-language 
media, including four local Peruvian newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
 The exhibit, which is now touring, attracted 100,000 visitors, including 
15,000 children from schools in East Los Angeles and other largely Latino areas 
who were given special tours. The museum also underwrote a "Royal Tombs of 
Sipan" issue of Faces, a nationally distributed anthropology magazine for 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, the Fowler will present shows devoted to a painter from Kenya, the 
household saints of Puerto Rico, the Iranian immigrant experience, Indonesian 
textiles, a Mexican artist who works in papier-mache, and the ancient religious 
rites of Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 Diversity, said Ross, "is what our museum has always been about."

MUSEUM OF TOLERANCE PLACES 'MORAL SPACE' ABOVE AESTHETICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 While some museum efforts to diversify may smack of political correctness, 
many museum officials believe they have a moral responsibility to foster ethnic 
inclusion and cooperation. Nowhere is that more explicit than at the year-old 
Simon Wiesenthal Center Museum of Tolerance on Wilshire Boulevard in West Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the museum is devoted to documenting the horrors of Hitler's war 
against the Jews, but the museum also includes interactive exhibits on the 
history and consequences of all kinds of intolerance. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the museum is opposed on principle to tracking the ethnicity of its 
visitors, it has "a very high minority attendance," said director Gerald 
Margolis. 
</P>
<P>
 He attributes the museum's popularity with minorities to the fact that it 
speaks so viscerally to their experiences with exhibits on slavery, the civil 
rights struggle and discrimination against Mexicans, Asians and others. 
</P>
<P>
 The Museum of Tolerance aspires to be a "moral space," said Margolis, while 
most art museums are "aesthetic spaces." 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, the Museum of Tolerance hosted an event unusual even in an era of 
ethnic outreach. It was the scene of a dinner at which Castlemont High School 
in Oakland was given a "Courage to Care" award by Gov. Pete Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, a group of African American and Latino students from Castlemont 
were thrown out of a Bay Area movie theater for jeering during a scene in 
"Schindler's List" in which a Jewish woman is slain. The theater audience, 
which included Holocaust survivors, was horrified. 
</P>
<P>
 The school's response to the incident was lauded at Monday's ceremony. As 
Rabbi Marvin Hier, dean and founder of the museum, said: "As soon as the school 
realized they had a problem, they dealt with it honestly and forthrightly." 
</P>
<P>
 The school took the occasion to teach the students about the Holocaust and to 
institute a program on racism and anti-Semitism. The Castlemont students also 
made a public apology. 
</P>
<P>
 Castlemont Principal Ellen Posey accepted the award. PATRICIA WARD BIEDERMAN

OUT AND ABOUT: IDEAS FOR A LOVELY VALENTINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 With Valentine's Day just four days off, it's time to remember the words of 
English poet John Donne: "More than kisses, letters mingle souls." 
</P>
<P>
 But then, so does a good night on the town. Here are a few suggestions to help 
you celebrate the weekend -- and Valentine's Day itself -- with someone 
special. 
</P>
<P>
 Weather permitting, Saturday could be spent walking along the beach. Stroll 
down the Venice boardwalk or along the Santa Monica Pier in the afternoon. Pack 
a picnic dinner and watch the sunset. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday, head to the Jazz Bakery in Culver City, where Judy Wolman will lead 
a special Valentine's edition of "Sing! Sing! Sing!," a program of accompanied 
group singing. It starts at 4 p.m. and will feature such love songs as "My 
Funny Valentine," "I Wish I Were in Love Again" and "You Gotta Have Heart." 
Tickets are $10. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday evening, Fama Restaurant will offer a special Valentine's menu 
created by chef Donna Insalocco. Fama's bargain three-course menu ($25) gives 
you first-course choices such as prosciutto and Parmesan-filled ravioli or a 
salad with goat cheese toast and tarragon vinaigrette. Entrees include rack of 
lamb served with potato gratin and grilled halibut with black-bean sauce. Top 
off the meal with a piece of passion-fruit cheesecake or flour-less chocolate 
cake. 
</P>
<P>
 And for a late-night cup of Java, head up to Anastasia's Asylum at 1028 
Wilshire Blvd. in Santa Monica. The shop pours coffees, herbal teas and more. 
Prices range from $1.35 to $3. On Valentine's Day, the shop will feature live 
music from 8 p.m. to midnight. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Jazz Bakery, 3221 Hutchinson Ave., Culver City; (310) 271-9039. Tickets 
are $10. Doors open at 3:30 p.m. and program begins at 4 p.m. Sunday.  
</P>
<P>

EDUCATION: WHERE TO DIG DEEPER INTO AFRICAN AMERICAN HISTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY LAINE YARBER, Mary Laine Yarber teaches English at Santa Monica High 
School. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Students looking to enrich their knowledge of African Americans and their 
contributions are often disappointed by standard history textbooks. Although 
more textbooks are addressing the historical roles of ethnic groups, they 
cannot do so as thoroughly as single volumes devoted exclusively to the 
subject. 
</P>
<P>
 In honor of Black History Month, consider some titles that can make your 
child's study more complete and interesting. 
</P>
<P>
 "Black Scientists of America," by Richard X. Donovan, highlights African 
Americans in fields such as chemistry, cancer research and plasma physics. The 
section on black women in science is especially thorough and impressive. 
</P>
<P>
 A companion book, "Black Inventors of America," by McKinley Burt Jr., is my 
favorite on this subject. Besides the usual life stories and pictures of 
inventors, it also includes clear copies of actual blueprints and 
patent-approval documents. 
</P>
<P>
 Both of these books are best suited for readers in upper elementary grades and 
junior high school. 
</P>
<P>
 "What They Never Told You in History Class" presents world history from an 
Afrocentric view. For teen-agers and adults, this book tells how Africans were 
the first mathematicians and describes numerous inventions and discoveries by 
blacks throughout history. The 300-page paperback is written by Indus 
Khamit-Kush. 
</P>
<P>
 A study of Martin Luther King Jr. is virtually required reading for anyone 
hoping to master African American history. There are many excellent biographies 
of King, but James H. Cone's volume, "Martin and Malcolm and America: A Dream 
or a Nightmare?" takes a unique approach that has won great praise from 
historians. It compares the goals, backgrounds, methods and legacies of both 
men. It is suited for readers in high school. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Tuskegee Airmen: The Men Who Changed a Nation," by Charles E. Francis, 
describes the exploits of a World War II squadron that earned honors in 
campaigns in Greece, Germany, Sicily and elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 For a general survey of black history, try "1999 Facts About Blacks: A 
Sourcebook of African American Accomplishment," by Raymond M. Corbin. It 
presents black achievements in history, art, literature, sports and 
entertainment by asking trivia-type questions, with answers at the back of the 
book. The illustrations are few and poor in quality, but the text more than 
compensates. Students in upper elementary and high school grades will 
undoubtedly enjoy and learn from this book. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, for readers in the early grades, "Africa Is Not a Country -- It's a 
Continent," by Dr. Arthur Lewin, will be a sure hit. The book describes the 
geography, people and cultures of Africa through puzzles and games. 
</P>
<P>
 These books are available at Midnight Special in Santa Monica and Eso Won 
Books in Inglewood. If driving is not a concern, try the Black and Latino 
Multicultural Book Center in Pasadena.

 The Comets played without starters Jason Hart, a 6-foot guard, and Damon

not play because of disciplinary reasons.  
</P>
<P>
 Young, a 6-2 forward, was especially impressive with 10 points and 12 rebounds 
against Los Angeles and 13 points and 11 rebounds against Venice. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Ed Azzam was impressed with his team's play. 
</P>
<P>
 "The enthusiasm is still there and the players know no one is going to hand 
them a win," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Comets, ranked No. 3 in the Southland, are expected to be seeded second 
when the City Section playoffs begin Feb. 23. Could they meet defending 
champion Crenshaw in the finals? 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a long way to go before we can think about Crenshaw," Azzam said. 
GOING HOME? 
</P>
<P>
 Fairfax hopes to get use of its main gym starting next week. The Lions have 
been forced to practice and play away from home because their athletic 
facilities have been used as a Red Cross Shelter in the aftermath of the Jan. 
17 earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lions will play a makeup home game today against Venice at Loyola 
Marymount University. 
</P>
<P>
 In a Western League game between the teams last week, Fairfax romped to a 
99-60 win. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was our best game of the year," Fairfax Coach Harvey Kitani said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tony Davis and Shaphan Roberts, both 6-2 guards, have made significant 
improvements offensively. Each has been scoring in double figures the past 
three games. GUESS AGAIN 
</P>
<P>
 From the don't believe everything you hear department. Fairfax football star 
Az-Zahir Hakim has not signed a football scholarship with San Diego State. In 
fact, the multipurpose player needs to pass his college entrance examination to 
qualify under NCAA regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 "There have been a lot of rumors floating around, but he hasn't signed," Coach 
Terrell Ray said. "Even if he does pass the (entrance exam), it's debatable 
whether he will sign with San Diego State." 
</P>
<P>
 Ray did say that running back Tyrone Evans signed with the Aztecs and 
defensive back/quarterback Myron Terry signed with Colorado State. 
</P>
<P>
 Evans, who led the area in rushing with 1,434 yards, was recruited as running 
back by the Aztecs. Ray, a former USC football player, said Evans is impressed 
with new Aztec Coach Ted Tollner, a former USC coach and NFL assistant. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the fact that Marshall Faulk did well at San Diego State and that his 
parents can drive down almost every weekend to see him play were also factors," 
Ray said. NEW HEIGHTS 
</P>
<P>
 Campbell Hall's 6-11 center Alex Lopez can pose defensive problems for 
opposing teams, but Crossroads did not have any trouble slowing down the 
Washington-bound senior during last week's home-and-away series. 
</P>
<P>
 Kejuan Woods, a 6-5 sophomore, was assigned to defend Lopez. In the first 
game, Lopez had only two points in the first half and 16 in the game. Woods had 
13 points, 10 rebounds and three blocked shots. 
</P>
<P>
 In the second game, Lopez had 14 points, but only two points in the second 
half. Woods had 16 points, 10 rebounds and four blocks. 
</P>
<P>
 Crossroads won both games, 63-59 and 68-61. MIXED REVIEWS 
</P>
<P>
 The St. Bernard girls' basketball team needed strong play from its tallest 
players to have a chance at beating first-place Alemany in a Mission League 
game. Olympia Scott, a 6-2 forward, came through with 17 points and 18 
rebounds. Marte Alexander, a 6-4 center, finished with only four points and 
five rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 The result was a 52-47 loss to Alemany. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have to admit that overall they're a better team," St. Bernard Coach Lori 
Pawinski said. "They have five good all-around players." 
</P>
<P>
 The Vikings (19-5), however, do not have to worry about Alemany when it comes 
to postseason play. The Warriors will be a seeded team in the Southern Section 
Division II-A playoffs and the Vikings will be in Division IV-AA. TEAM EFFORT 
</P>
<P>
 The Crossroads girls' team has developed a few more offensive threats to go 
along with Sherrise Smith. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, Yasmeen Yamini-Benjamin, a 5-10 junior forward, had 18 points and 
22 rebounds and Erin Irving scored 19 points to lead Crossroads to a 70-22 
victory over Campbell Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 "This team is playing well together," said Roadrunner Coach Larry Wiener, who 
earned his 200th career victory with the win. "The passing is really sound and 
we're spreading the ball around." 
</P>
<P>
 Smith, however, still scored her points, totaling 65 in three games. She is 
averaging 18.3 for the season. SEAN WATERS

CITY TO RAISE $11 MILLION FOR PLAZA; THOUSAND OAKS: MONEY TO PAY CONSTRUCTION 
COSTS WILL COME CHIEFLY FROM THE ISSUANCE OF BONDS OR THROUGH LOAN FUNDS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Incurring new debt to pay construction bills at the Civic Arts Plaza, the 
Thousand Oaks City Council has agreed to raise $11 million by issuing bonds or 
taking out loans, and to cover additional costs by juggling money among 
municipal accounts. 
</P>
<P>
 But council members unanimously rejected a proposal to shift $1.1 million from 
an affordable housing fund to the Civic Arts Plaza construction budget. 
Determined to preserve that money for development of low-cost housing and aid 
to first-time home buyers, they asked staff members to come up with an 
alternative source of money. 
</P>
<P>
 Even as they scrambled to plug gaping holes in the financing package, council 
members late Tuesday authorized a $165,000 electronic marquee to advertise 
events when the Civic Arts Plaza opens in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
 The billboard-size monument sign, which covers 240 square feet, will stand on 
Thousand Oaks Boulevard and will flash new messages as frequently as every half 
hour. 
</P>
<P>
 Money for the marquee will come primarily from the construction budget's 
contingency fund, which contains nearly $1 million set aside for unexpected 
cost overruns. The council has previously tapped that fund to pay for cosmetic 
add-ons, including the copper curtain that will cascade over the eastern wall 
of the auditorium's 10-story tower. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the substantial shortfalls in the budget and the high cost of the 
marquee, several council members said they considered the Civic Arts Plaza on 
track. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are very fortunate that sound financial planning over the years has left 
us with the kind of flexibility where we can fund a project of this type," 
Councilwoman Judy Lazar said. 
</P>
<P>
 Flexibility notwithstanding, Lazar and several of her colleagues expressed 
strong concern about draining the affordable housing fund to pay for employee 
cubicles in the City Hall portion of the Civic Arts Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
 Finance Director Robert Biery had estimated $1.1 million as a fair price 
covering the cost of office space, secretarial services and restroom use for 
the two full-time employees who administer the affordable housing program. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet after several council members questioned that price tag, City Manager 
Grant Brimhall conceded that the figure may have been off. He promised to take 
a fresh look at the calculations used to derive the price. 
</P>
<P>
 Although they rejected the use of affordable housing funds, all five council 
members approved Biery's other recommendations for funding the last eight 
months of construction at the long-awaited Civic Arts Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
 By far the largest chunk of money -- $11 million -- will come from either 
issuing short-term bonds or loans. The council gave Biery the freedom to choose 
the cheapest financing mechanism. 
</P>
<P>
 Either bonds or loans would be paid back in five to seven years, Biery said, 
or as soon as the city sells the former civic center at 401 W. Hillcrest Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the $11 million in debt financing, the council agreed to four 
transfers of city funds to the Civic Arts Plaza construction budget. 
</P>
<P>
 Three of the transfers -- from the utility fund, capital improvement fund and 
park fund -- were long-planned as a means of financing the City Hall portion of 
the $64-million facility. The fourth was unexpected, a $2-million loan from the 
city's self-insurance fund. 
</P>
<P>
 By dipping into the insurance fund, which covers minor workers' compensation 
and liability claims, the city will be able to fund construction of 10,000 
square feet of space initially intended to be used -- and paid for -- by the 
Conejo Recreation and Park District. 
</P>
<P>
 Biery said he expects to repay the insurance fund, with interest, once the 
city finds a tenant for that space. 
</P>
<P>
 Although she ended up voting for the money shuffling, Councilwoman Jaime 
Zukowski argued that the continuing transfer of municipal funds to the 
construction budget would force the city to cut services ranging from street 
sweeping to library services. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are, in effect, living beyond our means," Zukowski said. "It's very 
important that we have a vision for the future, and the Civic Arts Plaza will 
be a benefit to the community, but at the same time, we cannot blind ourselves 
to the present." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Resident Alec Macko agreed, urging the council to halt construction of the 
Civic Arts Plaza until the city can come up with a debt-free financing plan. 
"You toss figures around like you could dig a hole and pull money out of it," 
Macko said. "You can't. You're going to be taking it from the taxpayers." 
</P>
<P>
 But Councilwoman Lazar said funds earmarked for capital improvements, such as 
the performing arts center, cannot be used to pay for ongoing services. And she 
defended the city's decision to pour money into a regional performing arts 
center. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are still an envied community and we have provided exceptional services to 
our residents," Lazar said. "As a council, we expect and intend to continue to 
do that."

MAN KILLS ESTRANGED WIFE, THEN HIMSELF; MOORPARK: SHOOTINGS SHOCK UPSCALE 
NEIGHBORHOOD. COUPLE'S CHILDREN WERE AT HOME WHEN INCIDENT TOOK PLACE THERE.

<P>
 Two days after filing for divorce, a Moorpark woman was fatally shot Wednesday 
morning by her husband, who then turned the gun on himself, sheriff's deputies 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 While the couple's three children watched television on the first floor of 
their home, Carl Abe, 49, fired two shots from a .38-caliber handgun at his 
wife June, 35, in a second-floor bathroom, investigators said. One shot missed 
but the other struck the woman in the head, investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
 After hearing the shots, the oldest child -- a 6-year-old girl, ran upstairs, 
investigators said. Her father told her to go across the street and summon a 
neighbor, identified by deputies as Randall Dickey. As the little girl ran to 
the neighbor's house she heard another shot, investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dickey raced to the house and found Carl Abe's body lying on the master 
bedroom floor and June Abe's nude body in a dry bathtub. Dickey summoned 
Ventura County sheriff's deputies, who received the call at 7:44 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The shooting shocked residents of the upscale neighborhood of southwest 
Moorpark. 
</P>
<P>
 "They seemed like the happy American family -- a beautiful couple with the 
most beautiful children. I can't get over it," said Mary Anne Jorgense, 39, a 
neighbor who knew the Abes for two years. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple had been renting the house for about four years and seemed 
prosperous, judging by their full-time housekeeper and matching, phone-equipped 
Volvos. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors described June Abe as a beautiful woman who worked out of her house 
making fancy country-Western hats and shirts, which she sold in country dance 
clubs. 
</P>
<P>
 Carl Abe owned a promotional sales business in Newbury Park that operated 
seminars on buying and selling discounted trust deeds. He billed himself as 
"Mr. Mortgage." 
</P>
<P>
 Residents in the neighborhood saw the Abes as a close family who would take 
their three children -- the 6-year-old girl, a 3-year-old boy and an 
18-month-old boy -- on bike rides during the weekends. Deputies said they have 
never been called to the home before. 
</P>
<P>
 But people closer to the couple said that both the husband and the wife had 
recently complained about domestic problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Last Friday, June Abe told a friend -- country-Western dance instructor Rick 
Henderson -- that she was having problems in her marriage and that she might 
not go through with a business proposal they had discussed to teach workshops 
on country dancing. 
</P>
<P>
 And Carl Abe worried aloud to a business associate that his wife had filed for 
divorce and wanted half of his business and property. Two weeks before, Carl 
Abe asked Andy Nemtusak, who works at a business adjacent to Carl Abe's office 
in Newbury Park, and two others to be witnesses to a will he had just drawn up. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't think anything of it at the time," Nemtusak said.  
</P>
<P>
 But Henderson, who described June Abe as a nice, outgoing person, said he was 
surprised to hear of the marital discord. Only a month ago, he said, June Abe 
had told him she was a "happily married woman" and was concerned about pickup 
attempts at the country nightspots where she danced. 
</P>
<P>
 Henderson said he often saw June Abe at country bars, either alone or with a 
family friend, dance instructor James Dean. "She told me that (Dean) was the 
only guy her husband trusted her going dancing with," Henderson said. 
</P>
<P>
 When he spoke with June Abe on Friday, Henderson recalled, "She said, 'If you 
don't hear from me in a couple of days, the best of luck with everything.' At 
the time, I thought she was just going to pack and boogie out of town." 
</P>
<P>
 Paula Squier, 39, a neighbor whose children used to play with the Abes' 
children, said she learned about the couple's problems early Monday when she 
ran into June Abe at the East County Courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
 "She told me that she was filing for a divorce because of a lack of 
communication," Squier said. 
</P>
<P>
 June Abe told Squier that the only way she communicated with her husband was 
through the children, who would pass messages between the couple. 
</P>
<P>
 Andy Nemtusak's father, Joe Nemtusak, met June Abe when she worked at her 
husband's business before having children. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was a little rough, kind of a tough lady," Joe Nemtusak said. "But he was 
always kind of mellow, really nice. . . . You just never know." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, Carl Abe dropped in at Joe Nemtusak's office and said he believed 
his wife, after filing for divorce, had broken into his office Monday night and 
stolen some of his files. 
</P>
<P>
 "He asked would I please watch the office, and if I saw her do anything, to 
tell him," Nemtusak said. 
</P>
<P>
 Virginia Susman, the regular postal carrier for the industrial complex where 
Carl Abe worked, said he seemed upset over the divorce on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "He told me that his wife wanted half his business, and half of this, and half 
of that," Susman said. "He told me he'd been working his rear end off for his 
family and his kids." 
</P>
<P>
 The children were being cared for by Ventura County Public Social Services.

POLICE TO BEEF UP PATROLS AT SCHOOLS IN SIMI VALLEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Responding to calls for improved school safety, the Simi Valley Police 
Department has agreed to temporarily beef up patrols on the city's junior high 
and high school campuses. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For the next month, the lone police officer assigned to patrols at Simi Valley 
schools will be joined by two additional officers and a sergeant, Police Chief 
Lindsey Paul Miller said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 And the City Council on Monday will consider hiring a second officer for its 
Gang Understanding and Resistance Development program, which is designed to 
discourage students from joining or participating in gangs. The new GUARD 
position would cost $63,100 for the first year, City Manager Lin Koester said. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller said the temporary officers are being added to reassure students and 
parents that the city's schools are safe in the wake of the Feb. 1 fatal 
stabbing of 14-year-old Chad Patrick Hubbard at Valley View Junior High School. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are really sensitive right now, and we want to make sure we are able 
to quickly check out any rumors or possibilities of fist fights or other 
problems," Miller said. "We felt it would be prudent to escalate our presence, 
just to make sure that nothing further happens." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to Valley View, officers will patrol Royal High School, Apollo 
Continuation High School, and Hillside, Sequoia and Sinaloa junior high 
schools. Simi Valley High School is closed because of serious damage from the 
Jan. 17 earthquake, and its students attend Royal High. 
</P>
<P>
 City Councilwoman Sandi Webb, whose daughter is a ninth-grader at Valley View, 
praised the Police Department's action. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm happy that the city is paying attention to this problem and not just 
letting it slide by and get worse," Webb said. 
</P>
<P>
 At Monday's City Council meeting, Webb tearfully implored the city to place a 
police officer on each junior high and high school campus at the beginning and 
end of the school day. 
</P>
<P>
 "The approach the police decided to take is a little different from what I had 
in mind," Webb said. "But I'm willing to try this for a while and see how it 
works."

<P>
 Planning to catch up on your rest this weekend? Or do you insist (yawn!) that 
you have better things to do than sleep? 
</P>
<P>
 You're in good company: 
</P>
<P>
 * Napoleon had a reputation for getting by only a few hours of sleep a night, 
especially while waging one of his many wars to conquer Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 * President Kennedy would work in the Oval Office until 2 or 3 a.m. and rise 
at 7:30, with daily one-hour naps. 
</P>
<P>
 * President Clinton tries to get by on five hours and a nap, but he says he 
knows his limit is about 12 hours of work a day. 
</P>
<P>
 * Winston Churchill slept little and sometimes ridiculed those who slept more. 
</P>
<P>
 * Another British prime minister, Margaret Thatcher, kept up the tradition. 
She sleeps three to four hours a night. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Today" show anchor Bryant Gumbel, who has to be up and out by 4 a.m., is 
able to stay up late without feeling tired on the set. "I'm lucky," he says. "I 
only need four hours of sleep." 
</P>
<P>
 * The artist Salvador Dali felt the same way. When overtired, he used to sit 
holding a spoon over a tin plate on the floor. When he fell asleep, he'd drop 
the spoon, waking himself up, claiming to be completely refreshed. 
</P>
<P>
 * Leonardo da Vinci decided to sleep 15 minutes every four hours, a total of 
an hour and a half each day. After five months he gave up -- reporting that he 
felt all tingly around the head and was biting his tongue frequently -- and 
went back to his regular four hours.

BUILD IT YOURSELF -- SERIOUSLY; PRACTICAL VIEW: THE CHANCE TO OWN ELEGANT 
FURNITURE (WITHOUT SPENDING THE REST OF YOUR LIFE IN HOCK) IS SENDING CREATIVE 
TYPES TO THE WORKBENCH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Annie Wachtel of Hancock Park was touring the historic Gamble House in 
Pasadena when the small fern table caught her eye. She fell in love 
immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was quintessential Craftsman furniture -- mahogany with a green Italianate 
marble top and little ebony pegs and just the size for a fern. But it was roped 
off, so I couldn't even touch it." 
</P>
<P>
 So Wachtel was amazed and delighted when she saw an ad in American Bungalow 
magazine for a kit. For $150 and some hours of assembly work, she could have an 
exact copy of the Gamble House table. The kit came pre-cut with all the pieces, 
fasteners and instructions. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not a carpenter," says Wachtel, a garden consultant and designer, "but my 
sister helped me and we put it together ourselves. Now it's sitting in my 
living room, next to a black leather chair. It looks so good." 
</P>
<P>
 Wachtel typifies a new trend in the do-it-yourself furniture world. 
"Knock-down" furniture, also known as "RTA" (ready to assemble) has been around 
for years in the form of particle board bookcases and kitchen tables for young 
people in first apartments and others on tight budgets. 
</P>
<P>
 But today, people with their eyes on the upscale are buying kits to build 
reproductions of mission-style dining sets, Chippendale garden benches, Shaker 
writing desks, Queen Anne lowboys and Colonial grandfather clocks.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's the new way to buy quality furniture," says John Brinkman, editor of 
American Bungalow, published in Sierra Madre and dedicated to the Craftsman 
movement. The magazine went into the kit sideline after a staff member built a 
fern table and everyone who saw it wanted one, Brinkman says.  
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's also a reaction to the electronics age," he says. "There's a 
fascination with the natural textures of real, honest wood." 
</P>
<P>
 Brinkman says elegant kit furniture typifies the '90s interest in home and 
hearth with a touch of frugality thrown in. A kit saves up to half the retail 
price of assembled furniture. 
</P>
<P>
 "We make reproductions of museum pieces in kit form for customers who have an 
interest in Early American furniture but can't afford antiques," says Andrew 
Smith, president of Cohasset Colonials in Highham, Mass.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's a small niche kind of business -- our customers get a very high-quality 
piece of furniture and have the fun of putting it together. We encourage them 
to identify pieces with their name so people will remember that Uncle Wilbur 
built that desk." 
</P>
<P>
 "I just love telling people I made it myself," Wachtel says. "This is the 
period of interest in homes, and if you love your home, why not make something 
for it?" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Although there are levels of complexity, depending on the piece of furniture, 
most kits can be assembled by any amateur with enough patience to read 
instructions very carefully. And the kits are tailored for people who don't 
have woodworking tools but want the pride of craftsmanship. Patricia 
Metropolis, a New Mexico writer and editor who says, "I've never used my 
hands," recently built a slat-backed teak chair, cocktail table and a bench for 
the patio of her new home.  
</P>
<P>
 "I needed a little help, but not much, and I really enjoyed it," she says. "I 
could build another chair. And I saved a lot of money. I'm very pleased with 
myself." 
</P>
<P>
 Her kits came from Wood Classics in Gardiner, N.Y. "Our furniture is not 
inexpensive," says founder Eric Goodman. "Many people who could afford whatever 
they want buy kits. It's one way to work out frustrations on the weekend -- 
lovingly and carefully building something." 
</P>
<P>
 He agrees that part of the pleasure is the wood. "Wood has character, and it's 
not like stone or concrete. You don't have to apprentice for a long time, and 
you don't need strength."  
</P>
<P>
 What you do need, he adds, is patience. "If the kit is $600 and the assembled 
furniture is $1,100, you have to do something for that $500." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But in most instances, patience will pay off. Today's furniture kit 
manufacturers have done all the hard work, says Frank Coffee, author of a new 
book, "The Best Kits Catalog" (HarperCollins).  
</P>
<P>
 Quality kits come with all wood parts pre-cut and ready to assemble and 
finish, Coffee says: "Where rabbets, miters, dovetails or mortise-and-tenon 
joints are called for, they will have been machined at the factory." 
Furthermore, most companies offer 800 numbers for technical assistance, he 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 Steven Ernst at Coppa Woodworking in San Pedro, which sells Adirondack chair 
kits, links the interest in building furniture with a yearning for a simpler 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the yuppie thing -- searching for nostalgia," he says. "With everybody 
getting computerized, it's nice to do something with your hands. Something that 
gives you personal satisfaction." 
</P>
<P>
 Jose Cabanillas, 36, an aerospace engineer for Rockwell International, has 
built a stereo cabinet and the Craftsman fern table. "It's possible that things 
are not quite as excessive as they were in the last decade," he says. "People 
are looking for things today that give them more human connection." 
</P>
<P>
 He treasures the childhood memories of helping his grandfather, who had a 
woodworking shop in his attic. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope eventually to have a house with an attic and do the same thing," 
Cabanillas says. "For now, I have to make do with kits."

THE ANSWER'S STILL BLOWIN' IN THE WIND; REMEMBER WHEN IT SEEMED LIKE A SONG 
COULD SAVE THE WORLD? A FEW OF US HAVEN'T GIVEN UP ON THAT NOTION.

<P>
 Where have all the protest singers gone, long time passing? 
</P>
<P>
 Just now, a dozen of them are packed into a conference room seven floors above 
Hollywood and Cahuenga for a monthly workshop called Songs for Social Change. 
</P>
<P>
 Here, an odd squad of aggressively independent question-authority types sit 
around politely trading insights like scholars in an English Lit seminar. It's 
part hootenanny, part "Gong Show," part support group, part graduate tutorial 
in the rhythm and rhyme of revolutionary rhetoric. 
</P>
<P>
 At the moment, Richard Honig is singing "Walk Together," his tale of a 
well-intentioned public servant named Honest John: 
</P>
<P>
 I'll be your politician  
</P>
<P>
 to understand your position  
</P>
<P>
 and find solutions both of us can live with.  
</P>
<P>
 I'll take a wrecking ball  
</P>
<P>
 and knock down all the walls  
</P>
<P>
 that separate the differences between us.  
</P>
<P>
 Honig is a slender chap of 31 with pointy boots, a tidy mustache, a day gig as 
a financial analyst and the stiletto stare of a bard itchin' to make a point. 
</P>
<P>
 Just what that point might be, precisely, seems open to debate. 
</P>
<P>
 "Um, I like the irony of having a politician named 'Honest John,' " offers 
tonight's moderator, Ross Altman. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wasn't trying to be ironic," Honig says. His character is a guy who 
sincerely tries to do what's right, although things keep happening to make that 
more difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 What kind of things? 
</P>
<P>
 Well, like the L.A. riots. 
</P>
<P>
 Aha. "Did you have some direct experience that inspired this?" asks Altman, 
curious for a couple of reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 One, he believes that the strongest songs sprout from real life. And two, his 
own repertoire includes a ballad called "All the King's Horses," inspired by 
his nervous retreat from Inglewood on that ugly afternoon and a long night 
listening for the shattering of store windows downstairs that would tell him it 
was time to flee his La Brea Avenue walk-up. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just as an observer," Honig replies, "reading newspapers and watching TV." 
</P>
<P>
 A few others offer gentle comments -- a word choice here, a rhyme there -- but 
Jerry Atinsky cuts gruffly to the chase: 
</P>
<P>
 "Look, you're trying to straddle the fence and the trouble with that is you 
can fall and hurt your you-know-whats," he says. "Write about the cops or write 
about the blacks, but you need to get Honest John off the fence by making up 
your own mind." 
</P>
<P>
 Honig says this song is a big hit when he sings it in coffeehouses. Later, he 
says: "I knew (Atinsky) wouldn't like it. He's real confrontational, like a 
storm trooper just looking for somebody to rail against." 
</P>
<P>
 Atinsky might well find that description flattering. He and his guitar have 
been railing against one thing or another since World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 Now 76, he's among the last of the People's Songs crowd led by Waldemar Hille 
at L.A.'s First Unitarian Church from the 1940s through the '60s. 
</P>
<P>
 "We weren't writing love songs," Atinsky says. "During the McCarthy era, we 
wrote songs against McCarthyism. During Vietnam, we wrote songs about that." 
</P>
<P>
 Several workshop regulars describe Atinsky as a fine writer of single-issue, 
hit-'em-between-the-eyes protest songs. To each month's workshop he brings a 
somewhat impatient sense of history, tradition -- and skepticism. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our group was very politically astute, politically hep," he says wistfully. 
"Some of this group have a lot to learn." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In a crowd that shares little except a vigorous distaste for rules and 
formalities, the monthly routine works like this: 
</P>
<P>
 * Sign in at the door and take a seat in the circle of chairs. 
</P>
<P>
 * When your turn comes, pass out copies of your lyrics and perform your song, 
either live (many bring guitars, and there's a piano in the corner) or on tape. 
</P>
<P>
 * Smile and nod as everyone picks apart your message and how well you got it 
across. Some will scrawl comments on your lyric sheets, which will you collect 
and take home. 
</P>
<P>
 "That kind of feedback sort of validates writing those songs," says Carl 
Gunther, 37, who organized the loose-knit group last summer. "Before, there 
wasn't any place to get critiqued." 
</P>
<P>
 Gunther, a software systems analyst, brings prodigious organizational chops to 
this band of merry anarchists. 
</P>
<P>
 A songwriter since childhood, he compiled a list of likely candidates last 
July and sent out mailings. Of 105 names on his neatly computerized list, about 
30 have attended one or more sessions. 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone agrees that Gunther does a great job of making the workshops happen, 
although some take the feedback with a sizable grain of salt. 
</P>
<P>
 Altman, 47, is a full-time chronicler of current events who has self-released 
half a dozen albums with songs about everything from the Supreme Court to the 
L.A. Zoo. He performs about 35 shows a month, including many at schools, 
hospitals and nursing homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Altman says he attended the first session out of curiosity but left midway 
through: "I'm not sure how much most people really benefit from what's called 
'constructive criticism.' " 
</P>
<P>
 At that first session, he recalls, "People would listen, then say, 'I really 
like the title of your song, but . . . ' and then there'd be 15 minutes of why 
this is the most worthless thing ever written." 
</P>
<P>
 He returned the following month as one of several veteran performers who take 
turns as moderator. Although he often asks singers to elaborate on their songs, 
he steers clear of faultfinding. 
</P>
<P>
 Gunther, however, believes that those searching for feedback deserve to get 
some -- no matter how painful: "I'm determined not to let someone leave with a 
song that is poorly crafted, that doesn't communicate. We're not being fair to 
them if we do. And some of them don't come back because of that." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 To keep things moving and assure equal time, at the January session Gunther 
presents moderator Paul Baker with a kitchen timer and instructions to divide 
the number of minutes in the four-hour session by the number of names on the 
list. 
</P>
<P>
 Baker, 54, a Scotsman and former monk who plays a guitar he handcrafted 
decades ago from scraps of monastery wood, eyeballs the timer as if it were one 
of Gunther's computer systems. 
</P>
<P>
 Tonight the room is full, and numerous lively discussions are cut short to 
hear from everyone. 
</P>
<P>
 Altman starts with a tune he wrote before the ground had even stopped shaking 
from the Northridge quake. Everybody joins the chorus: 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't the Big One but it'll do,  
</P>
<P>
 till the Big One comes along.  
</P>
<P>
 Next up is Thomas Valle, a young Nicaraguan with a gently impassioned song "in 
honor of my family and what they went through, though it can relate to almost 
any situation": 
</P>
<P>
 Is this the price the innocent must pay  
</P>
<P>
 for the ones who follow in their own greedy ways?  
</P>
<P>
 Hope, how long must we wait before we are too late?  
</P>
<P>
 Altman and Baker ask Valle about his family's experiences in the Nicaraguan 
turmoil. 
</P>
<P>
 His responses make their point: While the song is lovely, it would have more 
punch if he made it more personal and less general. 
</P>
<P>
 "What you just said -- that your family lost everything but they didn't have 
all that much to begin with -- is more powerful than any line in this song," 
Altman says. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tried to keep it general," Valle says with a shrug. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to be specific to connect," adds Kim Friedman, who writes wickedly 
witty tunes about relationships. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, I just wrote it yesterday," Valle says. "I can work on it." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Joanna Cazden, a 20-year veteran of folk festivals and clubs now at work on 
her sixth album, offers a lilting country waltz that starts with the caller at 
a hoedown announcing a ladies' choice dance, then follows our heroine through a 
romance and marriage to a surprise pregnancy: 
</P>
<P>
 It's a lady's choice  
</P>
<P>
 when she has a voice  
</P>
<P>
 in dancing or standing alone.  
</P>
<P>
 Leave it in her hands  
</P>
<P>
 give her the chance  
</P>
<P>
 'cause the life that she's making  
</P>
<P>
 is finally her own.  
</P>
<P>
 Reactions veer onto what role her partner should play in this abortion 
decision, amid a flurry of male points of view, even Supreme Court citations, 
until Cazden throws up her hands: "This is a song, not a brief." 
</P>
<P>
 Valle scans the lyric sheet and shakes his head: "I got a little confused. In 
the first verse they're at a dance, and then they're married and having a kid, 
and I'm thinking 'Wow, she hasn't even kissed him yet.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Next! 
</P>
<P>
 Daniel Hersh, 45, a big Israeli army vet in batik pants and a blond ponytail, 
does a lot of pro-labor appearances and is still bummed that union leaders 
weren't interested in doing anything with his buy-American anthem, "American 
Hands." 
</P>
<P>
 "The Teamsters' spokesman told me, 'There's no room for songs in unions 
today,' " Hersh says, to groans from everyone present. "He said if I want to 
help, I should go register people to vote." 
</P>
<P>
 Tonight, he's at it again. "Those of you who think I'm xenophobic are gonna 
hate this one too," he says cheerfully, strumming his guitar and introducing 
"Oh Say Can You See": 
</P>
<P>
 So when we pick up a hammer  
</P>
<P>
 a toaster or a broom  
</P>
<P>
 a pair of shoes, a shovel  
</P>
<P>
 or the fruit of the loom  
</P>
<P>
 Before slappin' down our money  
</P>
<P>
 as we go to pay  
</P>
<P>
 We'll make darn sure the label says  
</P>
<P>
 "Made in the U.S.A."  
</P>
<P>
 Skimming the numerous verses, Seth Jackson says Hersh is "blaming the 
consumers, the unions, the Congress. It seems to me you're blaming everybody 
except the people most to blame for this -- the corporations who make these 
decisions." 
</P>
<P>
 A budding NAFTA debate is soon cut off, as a roomful of eager singers check 
their watches. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson is primarily a commercial songwriter more concerned with record sales 
than messages, but tonight he has brought lyrics for a heavy metal rock song 
about the corporate rat race: 
</P>
<P>
 Breaking their necks to earn their checks,  
</P>
<P>
 counting by the hour  
</P>
<P>
 While gray-suited men collect dividends  
</P>
<P>
 as they're playing Higher Power.  
</P>
<P>
 Although the very words heavy metal cause muttering throughout the room, 
there's enthusiasm for the message and most of the imagery. Several people ask 
him to clarify specific phrases. 
</P>
<P>
 "What is this 'Higher Power,' " Gunther asks. "Is that a game, like Monopoly?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Carl! You mean you've never been to a 12-step program?" Altman crows in 
disbelief. "You mean you're completely functional? "  
</P>
<P>
 As if rehearsed, the entire group choruses: "It means playing God." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Gunther's songs tend to be edgy morality tales of latter-day alienation, fully 
arranged and slickly recorded in his home computer studio. 
</P>
<P>
 Tonight's sample, a revision of "Doctors of Disaster": 
</P>
<P>
 They drug you up  
</P>
<P>
 They cut you up  
</P>
<P>
 They take your money  
</P>
<P>
 And they sew you up  
</P>
<P>
 And though there are honest healers, still, the thieves are thick as flies  
</P>
<P>
 Those Doctors of Disaster are gonna leave you paralyzed  
</P>
<P>
 Unless you open up your eyes.  
</P>
<P>
 Jackson cheers the changes from an earlier version, which didn't include the 
"honest healers." 
</P>
<P>
 Others think that the line sounds as if it were added by a lawyer, or pulls 
the punch of a song that is clearly just about dishonest ones. 
</P>
<P>
 Altman quotes one of his idols, protest songwriter Tom Paxton: "If you're not 
comfortable going for the jugular, then stay away from satire." 
</P>
<P>

ANN CONWAY: 'FOLLOW' PUTS THE HEART FIRST; BENEFACTORS OF SADDLEBACK MEMORIAL 
CARDIOLOGY CENTER TAKE A STAB AT HEALTHY FARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANN CONWAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dr. Michael Mullin has some advice for you dine-till-you-drop types: "Dip and 
stab!" 
</P>
<P>
 "Order your salad dressing on the side," advises Mullin, director of cardiac 
services at Saddleback Memorial Medical Center. "Then dip your fork in it," and 
stab those lettuce leaves. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a great way to cut back on fat intake at formal dinners. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically, we call it the 'wet-fork method,' " he said on Tuesday night at 
the "Follow Your Heart" benefit for the Saddleback Memorial Heart Institute at 
the Four Seasons hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 Mullin and a slew of other doctors, including Doug Lyle, president of the 
Orange County chapter of the American Heart Assn., were among guests at the 
annual benefit that features a heart-healthy, 1,000-calorie dinner. On the 
menu: charred tomato and cilantro soup, bibb lettuce with sunflower 
vinaigrette, roast breast of chicken or grilled swordfish and homemade apple 
tart. 
</P>
<P>
 While they agreed that a low-fat diet, abstention from smoking and regular 
exercise are great heart-helpers, Mullin and Lyle were at odds over how much 
alcohol one should imbibe daily. Lyle thought "one glass of any kind of 
alcohol" was enough. Mullin thought two was OK. 
</P>
<P>
 During the cocktail reception, where crunchy vegetable spring rolls were 
served, guests talked about the medical procedures that saved their lives. 
(Later, several heart patients would stand and pay tribute to their caring 
doctors.) 
</P>
<P>
 Ruben Ingram, for one, was glad to be alive. One afternoon last October, 
Ingram experienced severe chest pain and drove himself to the Saddleback 
emergency room. "I don't remember much after I got there," he said. "I was in a 
lot of pain, and then I began passing out." 
</P>
<P>
 "They found that his main artery was 99% blocked," said his wife, Marj. "The 
artery was so narrow that when they put in the catheter wire -- which is about 
as thick as one of our hairs -- it shut off the entire blood flow to his heart. 
They did an angioplasty to open it up." 
</P>
<P>
 Ingram has never smoked. Never drank excessively. Never been grossly 
overweight. "They think my problem was caused by a lesion in one artery," he 
said. "They don't know if was the result of a blood clot or heredity." 
</P>
<P>
 But one thing doctors do know. Ingram did the most important thing a person 
can do to prolong his life: He went to a hospital when he had chest pain. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't fool around with it," warned Mullin. Don't deny it. "Get to a hospital 
as fast as you can." 
</P>
<P>
 Event proceeds of about $45,000 will be used to purchase cardiology equipment 
for the hospital. Also among guests were event co-chairwomen Nan Owen and Karen 
Stevens, and Carol Dolan, recipient of the hospital's first aortic valve 
replacement. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Contest for nonprofit groups: Orange County RSVP, a bi-monthly publication 
that serves as a master calender for local charity events, is sponsoring a 
subscription contest that will bring winning nonprofit groups the chance to 
have a fully underwritten benefit with amenities provided by vendors such as 
Tiffany & Co. at South Coast Plaza (invitations) and Roger's Gardens of Corona 
del Mar (event coordination).  
</P>
<P>
 For contest information, call (714) 661-9266.

</P>
<P>
 Dinners Across Laguna: Ten Laguna Beach homes were the sites of 10 special 
dinners when Dinners Across Laguna was staged recently to benefit the 
Friendship Shelter for the homeless.  
</P>
<P>
 The $100-per-person benefit, chaired by Kathleen Abel, drew more than 200 
guests and profits of $20,750 for the Laguna Beach shelter, founded in 1988.  
</P>
<P>
 The fare in Abel's home was one of the highlights: phyllo-wrapped blackened 
chicken with chevre cheese. Guests included Colin Henderson, executive director 
of the shelter.

PIZAZZ . . . OR THE LACK OF FLASH? IS THE MUSIC MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE VISUAL 
IMPACT? HOW ABOUT CRUDENESS? DOES THAT KNOCK IT OUT OF THE BOX? HERE'S WHAT 
ROCK CRITICS AT THREE ORANGE COUNTY HIGH SCHOOL NEWSPAPERS HAVE TO SAY ON THE 
SUBJECT.; SCREEN TESTS; IMAGINATION IN WORDS AND PICTURES

School in Anaheim.

<P>
 Being a part of the "MTV Generation," I find it easy to view music videos as 
an art form. 
</P>
<P>
 Apart from the basics of decent camera work, skillful direction and ample set 
construction, a good music video requires imagination and symbolism. 
</P>
<P>
 While some musicians reserve the right to parade themselves or others half 
naked on front of a camera and call it a music video, I reserve the right to 
call it meaningless trash. 
</P>
<P>
 These musicians use unnecessary cheap thrills to make a statement, pathetic as 
that statement may be. Artists such as Madonna seem to insult our intellect and 
blanket our imagination by use of explicit "peep shows" during their videos. 
</P>
<P>
 However, other musicians, like the alternative band R.E.M. and Van Halen in 
"Right Now," also use symbolism, but add the beauty of bluntness by use of 
words displayed on the screen throughout the video.  
</P>
<P>
 Use of this technique enables viewers to read the imaginative lyrics and 
thoughts of the musicians. This reopens the door to reading, a pastime often 
forgotten by the "MTV generation." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet another imaginative route taken in music videos is the use of animation. 
Videos such as "Laid So Low" by Tears for Fears and "Human Behavior" by Bjork 
allow musicians to tell a story without any limitations. For example, use of 
animation in "Human Behavior" allowed Bjork to display our world in the 
unlikely switch of roles between animals and humans. 
</P>
<P>
 Music videos attempt to appeal to the mass variety of music video watchers and 
therefore need to be much more than a display of body parts. 
</P>
<P>
 They need to be enlightening as well as entertaining. Imagination is also a 
significant factor in the quality of a music video. Most music videos of today 
lack these key elements and leave them with a lot to be desired.

 Katie Kramer, 14 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 "I think the videos that do go beyond the bounds are carefully looked at by a

 Nicole Miller, 17

 "Yes, but everyone has the freedom to do whatever is inside one's self. That's 
what makes music videos so entertaining."

<P>
 Donnie Bowen, 17

<P>
 senior, Santa Margarita 
</P>
<P>
 "Music videos go beyond acceptable bounds, but it's probably what we like, so 
it makes it more interesting for us to watch."

<P>
 senior, Irvine

 "I believe that some videos show violence that shouldn't be in (there) if 
they're available to kids who might act on them. However, I have always thought 
that MTV was responsible about showing those videos."

they're too graphic for daytime TV."

 At Canyon High School in Anaheim, about 300 students, parents, teachers, staff 
and community members spent a recent Saturday sprucing up the campus at the 
second annual Canyon Pride Day. 
</P>
<P>
 Armed with a plan and armloads of donated materials, volunteer crews painted 
classrooms, benches, trash cans and the outdoor stage area by the cafeteria. 
</P>
<P>
 All the student restrooms got a new coat of paint; the plumbing was fixed and 
the floors scrubbed. Trees, shrubs and flowers were planted, and the library 
chairs and tables were refinished. Whew . . . and that's just part of the list 
that was accomplished. 
</P>
<P>
 After blitzing the campus, the workers were fed a meal of hot dogs, salad and 
drinks, furnished by the Anaheim Hills Rotary Club.

<P>
 For a music video to be considered truly great, it must possess the qualities 
that elevate it to an artistic work.  
</P>
<P>
 All too often, music videos simply consist of the lead singer of the band 
standing behind a microphone and singing. Occasionally, post-production will 
throw in some different backgrounds for effect. The concoctions can hardly be 
considered great videos, though. 
</P>
<P>
 While we don't actually dislike these videos -- and occasionally even enjoy 
them -- they cannot be called great just because they are popular. 
</P>
<P>
 A good video should become an extension of the song and further its meaning 
through the visual medium.  
</P>
<P>
 Most importantly, it must keep the viewer interested. Some of the best videos 
manage to keep the audience watching even when there's little interest in the 
song itself. 
</P>
<P>
 A great video must find the right spot between a completely literal 
interpretation of the lyrics and something that too closely resembles a concert 
video. 
</P>
<P>
 While the addition of graphic designs and artificially created settings can 
add value, technology should not be the focus of the video. Rather, it should 
blend into the entire setting and seem in place and "at home" in the video. 
</P>
<P>
 Very few videos have managed to be both popular and have artistic value. Some 
do strike the right balance, though, and should be remembered as truly great. 
</P>
<P>
 Here are what we consider the best five videos to date: 
</P>
<P>
 5. Peter Gabriel, "Steam": This video contains magnificent computer graphics 
that create one of the most imaginative settings ever witnessed. It is a 
definite eye-catcher from beginning to end and breaks the mold when it comes to 
music videos. 
</P>
<P>
 4. Depeche Mode, "People Are People": A song about people hating each other 
for no apparent reason. The video is set around a military ship and includes 
clips of footage from World War II, brilliantly illustrating the song's point. 
</P>
<P>
 3. Duran Duran, "Wild Boys": A video that displays an accurate picture of the 
people described in the song lyrics. And an almost frightening look at what 
listeners rarely take the time to visualize. 
</P>
<P>
 2. Dire Straits, "Money for Nothing": An incredible display of computer 
animation makes this video a sight to behold, even if the song doesn't hold as 
much interest. This video was indeed well ahead of its time. 
</P>
<P>
 1. Pet Shop Boys, "Suburbia": A video that truly captures the essence of the 
song! The setting is just right, and the lyrics and scenery blend impressively 
to embody the elements of a truly great music video.

 Deep in the forest, there is a beautiful woman roaming around aimlessly while 
a beastly creature named Meat Loaf spies on her through the trees. Then the 
woman is drawn to his mysterious castle while he is trying desperately to hide 
from her because of his deformed face. Suddenly, a bunch of cops are after him, 
and the beast-man starts breaking mirrors. 
</P>
<P>
 All the while Meat Loaf is singing, "I would do anything for love, but I won't 
do that !" 
</P>
<P>
 But just what is that ??? And what does it have to do with the rest of this 
confusing video? 
</P>
<P>
 Originally, this assignment seemed to be a breeze; what student wouldn't give 
an arm or a leg to sit in front of the television and watch videos all day in 
order to pick the best videos being broadcast? However, we soon discovered that 
there are too many videos and too little time in which to view them. So what 
makes a video worthy of our time and interest? 
</P>
<P>
 A good video must not only be eye-catching but interesting. To us, that means 
no cheesy eye gags like cardboard fish thrown in. For example, many of U2's 
videos are not just eye-pleasing but also amusing. We thought "Lemon" was 
really original, and we liked the captions describing each scene. We also 
enjoyed U2's "Numb," which equally teased us. 
</P>
<P>
 Although not a current video, R.E.M.'s "Everybody Hurts" is a video anyone can 
relate to. It left us with the feeling that we aren't the only ones with 
problems, although at certain points we did feel a sense of depression. This 
video was clear in showing each person's face, and the captions at the bottom 
were easy to read and process mentally. 
</P>
<P>
 Deep Forest's "Sweet Lullaby" is both culturally stimulating and pleasing to 
the ear. The lyrical melody soothed our inner souls, like a lullaby (hence the 
title, we suppose). A little girl on a tricycle pedals her way through various 
countries, and the cinematography is just as pretty as the tune. Throughout the 
video, there is an underlying theme that although people are culturally 
different and separated by their own customs, they are still alike. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes, the disturbing videos are the ones that stick in our heads, such as 
"Mary Jane's Last Dance" by Tom Petty & the Heartbreakers and the Guns N' Roses 
video "Don't Cry." Lingering feelings of eeriness attack our senses after 
watching them. 
</P>
<P>
 Good videos should also have a message or tell a story in order to capture our 
interest. For example, Pearl Jam's "Jeremy" tells the story of the suppressed 
and misunderstood youth of modern America. The images on screen make the video 
hard-hitting. 
</P>
<P>
 Aerosmith, like U2, is a veteran at making interesting videos. "Amazing" shows 
us the future of virtual reality while playing with our imaginations. "Crying," 
also by Aerosmith, shows a strong-willed teen-age girl. (While she is being 
tattooed and getting a belly-ring, you have to wonder what it would be like if 
you were she.) The video doesn't get repetitious after seeing it many times 
because the story line keeps you hooked. 
</P>
<P>
 In response to Tupac Shakur's "I Get Around," female rap stars Salt-N-Pepa 
came up with "Shoop," and it's about time someone came up with a video that 
portrays women as the aggressor in a relationship. Seeing women instead of men 
gawking at the opposite sex was very refreshing. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, too many videos simply copy successful ones. 
</P>
<P>
 Ever since Boyz II Men's video "End of the Road" became popular, there has 
been an influx on R&B groups that show scenes of the group "just hanging out" 
or walking down a road, such as Xcape, Shai and Hi-Five. Other copycat videos 
are the "let's jump off the stage and bruise ourselves" videos like "Mother 93" 
by Danzig or "Evenflow" by Pearl Jam. 
</P>
<P>
 There are many reasons a video doesn't hold a person's interest. Sometimes a 
video is overplayed until you grow tired of seeing it. Also, some videos annoy 
because of how they are filmed, such as the Gin Blossoms "Found Out About You," 
which had a bright flashing light that our eyes could only take for so long. 
</P>
<P>
 As the years go by, of course, the quality of videos will differ and hopefully 
improve. But until then, our judgment is that the nearest-near-perfect video 
currently playing is . . . nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 That's right. Sorry, folks, but those of you out there producing videos better 
get cracking; the perfect video is awaiting your creative making!

 MY TURN ; THERE'S DANGER IN FOLLOWING THE CROWD

 Lemmings have overrun the campuses of high schools around the country, 
virtually infesting them. No effort, however, has been made to exterminate 
these rodents from our schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Why? because these lemmings make up a good portion of the student body. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lemmings?" you might ask. "What in the world are lemmings?" For those of you 
unfamiliar with this creature (i.e., not avid viewers of PBS), a lemming is a 
small brown rodent, most common in Scandinavia. Now, you are probably 
wondering, "So what does this have to do with students in high school?" 
</P>
<P>
 Well, lemmings have this reputation for mindlessly running in herds -- 
sometimes going so far as jumping off cliffs into the ocean and drowning. 
</P>
<P>
 I know what you are thinking now, something along the lines of "What is she 
talking about?" 
</P>
<P>
 Let me explain. 
</P>
<P>
 Many students have irrational tendencies. No, not to hurl themselves off of 
cliffs, but irrational just the same. They, just like the lemmings, act simply 
because "everyone else is doing it." They don't bother to think on their own. 
Rather, these students, these lemmings, opt to blindly follow whatever their 
peers are doing, regardless of the consequences of their actions, regardless of 
whether it is right or wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 This peculiar species can be spotted roaming the halls of high schools across 
the nation, wearing the same "cool" uniform as its fellow herdmates, and doing 
only those activities previously approved by the rest of the herd -- like 
drinking, smoking or tagging. 
</P>
<P>
 Will this infestation ever end? I honestly don't know, but as for me, I don't 
plan to get caught near the cliffs anytime soon.

 Growing into an adult seems to be the hardest part of life. There are so many 
decisions to be made -- about sex, drugs, peer pressure and other things. 
Sometimes the right answer isn't always there. However, it isn't fair to assume 
that all teen-agers are sexually active, drink and take drugs. Each and every 
one of us is very different. 
</P>
<P>
 As a teen-ager in today's society, I have experienced different forms of 
discrimination. This discrimination comes from adults who generalize about all 
young adults. They forget how they were when they were "growing up" and how 
different everyone else was from them. 
</P>
<P>
 Many rules and regulations throughout the community are directed toward 
teen-agers. For instance, no-loitering signs often appear to be telling teens 
not to "hang out" there with their friends. 
</P>
<P>
 One of my teachers suggested the reason that society feels that teens must 
have these rules is due to the weakened family structure. Society then feels 
that young adults need some type of structure since they are not getting it at 
home. 
</P>
<P>
 A lot of incidents regarding teen-age discrimination occur because of the lack 
of communication between adults and teens. When the news media report negative 
incidents that are teen-related, it causes us to be stereotyped. 
</P>
<P>
 In my own life, two incidents stick out in my mind that made me feel I was 
discriminated against. I was in a drugstore not too long ago when a clerk asked 
my friends and me to remove our backpacks. This order made us angry, so we 
inquired further to understand why. Well, my hunch was right -- the man thought 
that we might steal something. We felt so frustrated. Here's this man who 
doesn't even know us and he just presumes we are going to shoplift. 
</P>
<P>
 Another time I was with some friends and we decided to go into a rather fancy 
store to look at dresses. The people who worked there were very rude to us, and 
then they told us that they were closing the store. Well, after we had left the 
store, one of the clerks immediately reopened the doors. We were annoyed by 
their rudeness and felt it was directed at us because of our age. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm not the only teen-ager who has stories of discrimination. When I asked 
other students at my high school about it, nearly all said that they had felt 
discriminated against at least once in their life. Whether they were treated 
second-best at a restaurant or ignored in a store because of their age, it 
isn't right! 
</P>
<P>
 Teen discrimination is an important issue that needs to be dealt with. Adults 
and teens need to work together to create better means of communication and a 
stronger relationship between the two generations. 
</P>
<P>
 Our generation is ready to conquer the world's big problems, and the world 
should be ready to listen, respect and not misjudge the young adults of today.

 The Scottish guitar quartet Teenage Fanclub had a lot to live up to with the 
release of its third album, "Thirteen." 
</P>
<P>
 Spin magazine called the group's previous release, "Bandwagonesque," the "best 
album made by white people in 10 years," and it earned a slew of accolades from 
music press all over the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately, Teenage Fanclub has managed to deliver the type of perfect 
guitar-pop record that is certain to last for years. 
</P>
<P>
 Mixing influences of the Byrds and Neil Young with the spirit of flowing 
guitar aggression seen in more modern bands such as Dinosaur Jr. and Sonic 
Youth, "Thirteen" combines sparkling melodies and simple pop-song lyrics with 
fuzzed-out basses and over-driven guitar tracks that move with roaring 
intensity. 
</P>
<P>
 Songs such as "Hand On," Radio" and "Gene Clark" all have the warm, timeless 
quality and instantly catchy melodies that recall bouncing around one's room to 
giddy pop love songs. 
</P>
<P>
 With the record, Teenage Fanclub has edged one step closer to becoming the 
Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young of our generation.

 CAPONE'S ALLEGED HIDE-OUT IN TOUR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Romantics will think about hearts and flowers on Valentine's Day, but others 
might recall something a little less heartwarming: the St. Valentine's Day 
Massacre. The man allegedly behind the machine guns was Al Capone.The mobster 
was also allegedly the man behind the wrought-iron "C" on the chimney of a 
Fontana house, a 1920s winter residence used by an unnamed Chicago snowbird and 
the feature of a six-house historic homes tour on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Rumors still abound in town that the house was a hide-out for Capone, and 
old-timers swear to have spotted him in Fontana in the '20s, say members of the 
Fontana Historical Society, which is hosting the tour. The mysterious house has 
a chimney sticking out of the roof -- above a hollow wall, not a fireplace -- 
and several closets that could have been accessed from other closets, until a 
renovation altered that floor plan. There's also a mysterious painting of a 
woman in a chair that has been hanging in the home for 50 years.  
</P>
<P>
 The house is a private residence now, and a tour of it and five other homes 
built between 1906 and 1938 will raise money for the historical society. The 
tour will be held from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. Meet at 8863 Pepper, Fontana, two 
blocks west of Juniper. Pre-registration is $15; at the door, $20. For more 
information, call (909) 829-8678. LAURIE K. SCHENDEN

THE 66TH ACADEMY AWARD NOMINATIONS; OSCAR'S FAVORITE 'LIST'; THE NOMINATIONS; 
'SCHINDLER'S' SWEEPS UP WITH 12 NODS; 'THE PIANO' AND 'THE REMAINS OF THE DAY' 
BOTH RECEIVE EIGHT NOMINATIONS; 'FUGITIVE,' 'IN THE NAME OF THE FATHER' EARN 
SEVEN.

<P>
 In a year that brought Steven Spielberg incredible commercial success with 
"Jurassic Park," his dramatic and risky Holocaust epic "Schindler's List" swept 
the 1993 Oscar nominations Wednesday in 12 categories, including best picture 
and best director. 
</P>
<P>
 It represents the most nominations since 1990's "Dances With Wolves," which 
also received 12 and went on to win seven, including best picture. Before that, 
no film had received as many nods since 1981's "Reds," which amassed 12 
nominations but did not win best picture. The highest number of nominations in 
Oscar history was 1950's "All About Eve," which received 14 and won six, 
including best picture. 
</P>
<P>
 The best picture nominees, like Universal Pictures' "Schindler's List," are 
all dramas: Miramax Films' New Zealand period piece "The Piano" and Columbia 
Pictures' 1930s melancholy romance "The Remains of the Day," both receiving 
eight nominations; and Warner Bros.' action thriller "The Fugitive" and 
Universal's political father-son drama "In the Name of the Father," both 
earning seven nominations. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the surprises in the nominations were Laurence Fishburne's picking up a 
best actor nod for "What's Love Got to Do With It" and the omission of such 
prominent directors as Martin Scorsese and Jonathan Demme and also "The 
Fugitive's" Andrew Davis. 
</P>
<P>
 Spielberg, whose three-hour-plus film was shot in sobering black and white and 
takes place in a Nazi-run concentration camp in occupied Poland, said the main 
joy of the nominations was the recognition of the subject. He told The Times, 
"For a subject that has needed attention for almost half a century, I am beyond 
gratified that so many people are not looking the other way when they hear the 
word Holocaust. " 
</P>
<P>
 The filmmaker said the news of 12 nominations was "overwhelming" and 
represented "a very special moment for all of us who have dedicated ourselves 
to this subject." 
</P>
<P>
 "Schindler's List," which tells the story of how German businessman and Nazi 
Party member Oskar Schindler secretly saved the lives of more than 1,100 Jews, 
is the first black-and-white movie to be nominated for best picture since 
1980's "Raging Bull" and "The Elephant Man." If it wins, "Schindler's List" 
will be the first black-and-white film to get the best picture honor since 
1960's "The Apartment." 
</P>
<P>
 "The Remains of the Day" producer Ismail Merchant praised the academy for 
singling out emotionally involving pictures this year rather than simply going 
for star vehicles. "The Hollywood community is smart, which is what's 
important," he said. "It's a reflection that the academy is in the right 
place." 
</P>
<P>
 The academy, however, didn't ignore one of the year's big-star, high-concept 
and most successful movies, "The Fugitive," although star Harrison Ford didn't 
receive a nomination. The film's producer, Arnold Kopelson, who won the best 
picture Oscar for the 1986 hit "Platoon," said the nomination was "an 
affirmation that a film can be a box-office success and still receive the 
attention of the academy." With $170 million in U.S. and Canadian grosses, 
"Fugitive" was the third-biggest ticket seller of 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday's pre-dawn announcements by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and 
Sciences for the 66th annual awards also made Oscar history. For only the 
second time, a woman -- "The Piano's" Jane Campion of New Zealand -- was 
nominated for best director. Italy's Lina Wertmuller was the first, for her 
1976 comedy "Seven Beauties." But Campion is the first nominated female 
director to have a best picture nomination. 
</P>
<P>
 Campion, who was ill and unavailable for comment Wednesday, said in a prepared 
statement: "I feel privileged to be in the company of such incredible, 
important filmmakers." "Piano" producer Jan Chapman said in a phone interview 
from New Zealand at half past 3 a.m. today: "This is very, very exciting news, 
something I wasn't prepared for." She said earlier in the day that she had had 
a conversation with Campion in which "we said we'd both go to sleep and see 
whether we would be woken up with good news." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides Campion and Spielberg (who received his fourth directing nomination), 
the others in the category are: Jim Sheridan for "In the Name of the Father," 
his second nomination; James Ivory for "The Remains of the Day," his third; and 
Robert Altman for "Short Cuts," his fourth. None of the nominees has ever won. 
</P>
<P>
 The nomination of Altman, although not a surprise, was an oddity. It is his 
fourth nomination in this category, and he clearly is highly regarded by 
academy members, but "Short Cuts" received no other nominations. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast, "Fugitive" director Davis, who received a nomination from the 
Directors Guild, was not nominated for an Oscar, although the film is a best 
picture candidate. 
</P>
<P>
 Academy voters also gave short shrift to Scorsese and his "The Age of 
Innocence" from Columbia Pictures and director Demme and his "Philadelphia," 
the first major studio movie about the AIDS epidemic, from TriStar Pictures. 
Neither film received a best picture nomination, but each was nominated in five 
categories. 
</P>
<P>
 The first-time nomination of Fishburne for his performance as pop musician Ike 
Turner in Touchstone Pictures' "What's Love Got to Do With It" was unexpected, 
given that the veteran actor had not been widely mentioned in pre-Oscar 
speculation. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Fishburne said he, too, was surprised about the honor: "I'm elated. I was 
talking to some friends on the phone earlier and was jumping up and down." When 
asked what he thinks the nomination will mean for his career, the actor said, 
"I have a wonderful career, and I'm grateful for whatever it means." 
</P>
<P>
 Ignored entirely in the nominations were the Samuel Goldwyn Co.'s critically 
praised "Much Ado About Nothing," directed by Kenneth Branagh, despite an 
all-out Oscar campaign, and Walt Disney Co.'s generational mother-daughter 
drama "The Joy Luck Club." 
</P>
<P>
 And although Tom Hanks received a best actor nomination for his performance in 
"Philadelphia" as a lawyer with AIDS, his co-star and previous supporting actor 
Oscar winner (for "Glory"), Denzel Washington, didn't make the Oscar lists. 
</P>
<P>
 For Hanks, the nomination is the second of his career. The first was for 
"Big."  
</P>
<P>
 Joining Hanks and Fishburne are nominees: Daniel Day-Lewis, named best actor 
for 1989's "My Left Foot," for "In the Name of the Father"; Anthony Hopkins, 
who won for "The Silence of the Lambs," for "The Remains of the Day," and 
first-time nominee Liam Neeson, for "Schindler's List." 
</P>
<P>
 Holly Hunter and Emma Thompson were the only multiple nominees, with two 
apiece. 
</P>
<P>
 Hunter, who won the Golden Globe and top critics' prizes, received a best 
actress nomination for her completely silent performance in "The Piano," set in 
turn-of-the-century New Zealand. She also was nominated for supporting actress 
in last summer's popular thriller "The Firm." 
</P>
<P>
 Thompson, 1992's best actress winner for "Howards End," also came out with two 
nominations: as best actress in "The Remains of the Day" and as supporting 
actress in "In the Name of the Father." 
</P>
<P>
 The other actress nominees are Stockard Channing, re-creating her Broadway 
role in "Six Degrees of Separation," a first-time nomination; Angela Bassett as 
Tina Turner in "What's Love Got to Do With It," also a first-time nod. Debra 
Winger, nominated for best actress in "An Officer and a Gentleman" and "Terms 
of Endearment," was honored for "Shadowlands." 
</P>
<P>
 Channing, who heard the news in San Francisco, said: "I feel nothing but 
gratitude to MGM and (director) Fred Schepisi for their decision to do this. 
I'm sure there were moments when the studio wondered if they should have gone 
with someone more famous." 
</P>
<P>
 In the supporting actor category, there were first-time nominations for 
Leonardo DiCaprio for "What's Eating Gilbert Grape," Ralph Fiennes for 
"Schindler's List" and Pete Postlethwaite for "In the Name of the Father." 
Second-time nominees in this category are Tommy Lee Jones for "The Fugitive" 
and John Malkovich for "In the Line of Fire." 
</P>
<P>
 For supporting actress, besides Hunter and Thompson, there are first-time 
nominees Anna Paquin for "The Piano," Rosie Perez for "Fearless" and Winona 
Ryder for "The Age of Innocence." 
</P>
<P>
 Perez, reached in Berlin, where she is to attend the Berlin Film Festival 
("Fearless" is screening there), said she was "shocked by the news" when people 
from Warner Bros. began pounding on her hotel-room door. "All these Warner 
Bros. people were screaming their heads off. I said, 'Oh, my God.' I was like 
screaming." 
</P>
<P>
 Eleven-year-old Anna Paquin is the youngest nominee since 8-year-old Justin 
Henry for his supporting role in 1979's "Kramer vs. Kramer." 
</P>
<P>
 "When I first woke up and was informed about the nomination, I said: 'Truly, 
Dad, you're not joking? I'm not dreaming this, am I? Did Holly get nominated 
too?" 
</P>
<P>
 While the bulk of nominations in most categories went to films with dramatic 
and serious subjects, in the original screenplay category, the comedies "Dave" 
by Gary Ross and "Sleepless in Seattle" by Nora Ephron, David S. Ward and Jeff 
Arch, received recognition. The others are Jeff Maguire for "In the Line of 
Fire," Campion for "The Piano" and Ron Nyswaner for "Philadelphia." The 
nomination for "Philadelphia" comes as a legal battle rages regarding the 
origin of the story. 
</P>
<P>
 For screenplay adaptation, the nominees are Jay Cocks and Scorsese for "The 
Age of Innocence," Terry George and Sheridan for "In the Name of the Father," 
Ruth Prawer Jhabvala for "The Remains of the Day," Steven Zaillian for 
"Schindler's List," and William Nicholson for "Shadowlands." 
</P>
<P>
 Films from Asia dominated the foreign-language category, among them "The Scent 
of Green Papaya," the first film from Vietnam to be nominated. The other two 
are "Farewell My Concubine" from Hong Kong and "The Wedding Banquet" from 
Taiwan. The Welsh-language movie "Hedd Wyn" from the United Kingdom and Spain's 
"Belle Epoque" rounded out the category. 
</P>
<P>
 Three major pop music stars -- Janet Jackson, who co-wrote "Again" for the 
movie "Poetic Justice," and Bruce Springsteen and Neil Young, who wrote one 
song each for the movie "Philadelphia" -- are among the nominees for best song 
written directly for the screen. 
</P>
<P>
 The two top-grossing films of 1993, Spielberg's "Jurassic Park" and the Robin 
Williams comedy "Mrs. Doubtfire," scored in the technical categories only: 
"Jurassic" for sound, sound effects editing and visual effects; "Doubtfire" for 
makeup.

THE 66TH ACADEMY AWARD NOMINATIONS; COMMENTARY; SOMEHOW, THE FILM ACADEMY GETS 
IT RIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH TURAN, TIMES FILM CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Periodically derided for being ossified, provincial and worse, the Academy of 
Motion Picture Arts and Sciences did more than hand out a slew of nominations 
Wednesday, it struck a blow for its own reputation. 
</P>
<P>
 No, the actors' branch didn't come up with the nerve to nominate David Thewlis 
for "Naked," indisputably one of the top male performances of the year, but the 
academy did demonstrate notable discernment in picking its way through the 
hundreds of films eligible to find diamonds glittering in the rough. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Angela Bassett and Laurence Fishburne, exceptional in "What's Love Got to 
Do With It," got tapped for best actress and best actor even though their film 
was not that broadly seen. The same goes for youthful prodigy Leonardo 
DiCaprio, a best supporting actor nominee for the even less-seen "What's Eating 
Gilbert Grape." And the actors resisted the temptation to go with Anthony 
Hopkins' showier performance in "Shadowlands" and picked his more subtle work 
in "The Remains of the Day" instead. 
</P>
<P>
 Other academy branches were equally discriminating. The directors recognized 
what an accomplished piece of work "Short Cuts" was for Robert Altman, the 
cinematographers picked up on the virtuoso quality of Conrad Hall's photography 
in "Searching for Bobby Fischer," and both the art directors and costumers 
understood that those were the only elements of "Orlando" worth getting excited 
about. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly the writers' branch, which has been accused of shortchanging both 
comedy and action scripts, nominated "Dave," "Sleepless in Seattle" and "In the 
Line of Fire" for best original screenplay. And the academy as a whole showed 
itself not too snooty to appreciate the gangbusters' charm of "The Fugitive," 
picking it seven times, including best picture but not including director (and 
DGA nominee) Andrew Davis. 
</P>
<P>
 For those nominated films that were not must-sees when they played in 
theaters, the role of videotapes shipped to academy members' homes loomed once 
again as a potent weapon. Tapes were also probably critical for the powerhouse 
"In the Name of the Father," which did not show up in theaters until Dec. 29 
but ended with seven nominations. 
</P>
<P>
 The academy also showed notable restraint in the recognition it gave to 
"Philadelphia," which opened to a lot of buzz many moviegoers felt it didn't 
live up to. Aside from nominations going to good soldier Tom Hanks for best 
actor and Ron Nyswaner for best original screenplay, the film's only other 
successes were for two original songs and best makeup. 
</P>
<P>
 If any quality films had reason to feel that the academy was not nearly as 
discerning as it might be, "Much Ado About Nothing" and "The Age of Innocence" 
would fit the bill. Despite glowing reviews and a strong campaign, "Much Ado" 
did not manage a single nomination. And "Age," though it did gather five, could 
not secure one for director Martin Scorsese, generally emphasizing the truth of 
the buzz that the film was not playing well in this town. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, though this year might superficially look like a resurgent one for 
the Hollywood Establishment, a closer look at the biggest winners underlines a 
trend -- first noticeable the last time around -- away from traditional studio 
product as Oscar contenders. 
</P>
<P>
 First of all, several studios did not fare well at all in Wednesday's 
announcements. The Disney organization, which probably released more films than 
any other major studio last year, can boast of only three nominations, ditto 
for Paramount, while all 20th Century Fox had to show for its trouble was a 
single nod for best makeup for "Mrs. Doubtfire." 
</P>
<P>
 Look now at the big winners. "The Piano," with eight nominations, including 
best picture, was an independent French-Australian production using American 
stars. Two other best picture nominees, the Merchant Ivory "Remains of the Day" 
(eight nominations) and "In the Name of the Father," had largely British casts 
and crews, came to the studios that distributed them as tidy packages and did 
not go through the usual development process. 
</P>
<P>
 And with Steven Spielberg, like Clint Eastwood with "Unforgiven" last year, 
functioning pretty much as an independent duchy while shooting "Schindler's 
List," that left only one film out of five, "The Fugitive," to hold up the flag 
for the old-fashioned Hollywood way of making pictures. 
</P>
<P>
 The same international cross-fertilization that characterized the best picture 
nominees was also a factor in the best foreign-language film nominees. In fact, 
three of the pictures named -- "Farewell My Concubine," "The Wedding Banquet" 
and "The Scent of Green Papaya" -- had origins so multinational it took a 
special dispensation from the academy before they could be declared eligible. 
For once, the surprises in this category were minimal: the lack of a nomination 
for "Germinal," the ponderous epic from France, and the inclusion of "Hedd 
Wyn," a Welsh-language film from the United Kingdom. 
</P>
<P>
 If the foreign-language selections looked mostly familiar to habitual 
moviegoers, the same could not quite be said for the feature documentaries, 
though there was progress in that area. Two of this year's choices, "The War 
Room" and "Children of Fate," were good enough to have earned theatrical 
releases, but the doc branch didn't see fit to nominate such fine work as "It's 
All True" and "Something Within Me," a big favorite at Sundance last year. 
Maybe the three unknown films that were picked will turn out to be dazzling, 
but if experience is any judge, don't hold your breath.ACADEMY OF MOTION

THE 66TH ACADEMY AWARD NOMINATIONS; A DIRECTOR'S DILEMMA; HOW CAN SPIELBERG 
FOLLOW SPIELBERG?; THE COMMERCIAL TRIUMPH OF 'JURASSIC' AND ARTISTIC COUP OF 
'SCHINDLER'S' HAVE LEFT EVERYONE WONDERING WHAT'S NEXT.

<P>
 So, what does someone who has made, back to back, the biggest grossing motion 
picture of all time and the most critically acclaimed movie of the year do for 
an encore? Answer: He has no idea. 
</P>
<P>
 Steven Spielberg is poised to win his first best director Oscar this year and 
his epic Holocaust drama, "Schindler's List," looks like the shoo-in of all 
shoo-ins to capture the best picture award. Meanwhile, his trademark escapist 
fantasy-adventure tale "Jurassic Park" has merely made world box-office 
history.  
</P>
<P>
 Yet, the 46-year-old filmmaker faces a huge dilemma. If his next film is 
perceived "pseudo-serious," Spielberg risks being raked over the critics' 
coals, with his work on "Schindler's" seen as a fluke. After all, it has taken 
the director some 25 years to win validation for a serious adult movie and not 
just as history's most successful filmmaker at the box office. Spielberg's 
three dramas, "The Color Purple," "Empire of the Sun" and "Always," brought him 
mixed reviews for being overly sentimental. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps this is why Hollywood insiders say Spielberg is having second thoughts 
about directing the planned screen version of Robert James Waller's 
melodramatic best-seller "The Bridges of Madison County" for Warner Bros. 
</P>
<P>
 The director's spokesman, Marvin Levy, and Warner executives continue to 
maintain that Spielberg will not make a definitive decision about directing 
"Bridges" until the final script is delivered (Richard LaGravenese, an Oscar 
nominee for "The Fisher King," is about to undergo a third rewrite). Yet he has 
expressed his reluctance to some in the industry. 
</P>
<P>
 "A little birdie told me he's not going to do it," says one highly placed 
studio executive, referring to a recent conversation he had with Spielberg. 
</P>
<P>
 Newsweek movie critic David Ansen also recalled a recent tete-a-tete he had 
with Spielberg at the New York Film Critics luncheon in which the filmmaker 
expressly said he had "changed his mind" about directing "Bridges." 
</P>
<P>
 Spielberg was even quoted in a Dallas newspaper saying, "This just wouldn't be 
the right time to do it," despite previous reports that he would be directing 
Clint Eastwood in the movie. (No cast is set and even if he doesn't direct, 
Spielberg will still produce with Kathleen Kennedy through his production 
company Amblin Entertainment, which bought the Waller book while it was in 
galley form.) 
</P>
<P>
 While Ansen says he thinks it would be a mistake for Spielberg to direct 
"Bridges" ("it's major kitsch"), he says the director has a dilemma that is 
both professional and spiritual. 
</P>
<P>
 "The experience of making 'Schindler's' actually changed him and the way he 
thinks about movies and what he should be doing," Ansen says. "He told me 
whatever he does it has to be something that moves him deeply." 
</P>
<P>
 That, Ansen adds, would not necessarily have to be something of the gravity of 
a "Schindler's," and could be "an entertainment movie, but it really has to be 
something that speaks to him strongly." 
</P>
<P>
 No question about it, critics agree, Spielberg has a tough act to follow. 
</P>
<P>
 So what about returning to the kind of movies on which he built his fame and 
fortune -- mass-appeal stock on the order of "Jurassic Park" and "E.T. -- The 
Extraterrestrial"? Naturally, there is much talk at Universal about a sequel to 
"Jurassic," which has grossed nearly $900 million worldwide, and about a fourth 
installment to his commercially successful "Indiana Jones" series starring 
Harrison Ford. 
</P>
<P>
 "My theory is he can get away without losing his prestige by doing a 'Jurassic 
Park' or 'Indiana Jones' sequel or a new mass-entertainment movie because he 
does it really well," says a Universal insider. "What he can't do is be seen as 
a striver. He can't say, 'Now I'll do Bosnia.' And he can't do 'Bridges' 
because it's false -- so he's got a tough problem." 
</P>
<P>
 But Ansen doubts whether Spielberg will immediately jump into a sequel of 
"Jurassic" (which author Michael Crichton hasn't even begun to write), and 
believes he is "strong enough to withstand any pressure from Universal." 
</P>
<P>
 Kenneth Turan, the Los Angeles Times movie critic, concurs that "there is no 
reason" for Spielberg to make a sequel right now, unless he simply wants to 
"make money," which seems doubtful. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a question of what does he want out of his career and what's the best 
use of his talents from a critical and an audience point of view," Turan says. 
"And 'Jurassic II' would not be the best use of his abilities at this point in 
his career." Nor for that matter, insists Turan, would "Bridges," which "would 
be like falling off a log" for Spielberg because "it's not going to be a 
stretch." 
</P>
<P>
 Turan says, "I'd like to see a guy this talented stretch himself more, do 
things that are challenging. . . . He has to decide how many chances he wants 
to take with his career. 'Schindler's List' was a risk and it paid off, and I 
think he's happy he did it. The more risks he is willing to take, the better 
films we're going to see." 
</P>
<P>
 He takes nothing away from Spielberg as a mainstream filmmaker ("thank God he 
is"), but Turan says, "I think he ought to try and look for films that combine 
the strengths of both 'Jurassic Park' and 'Schindler's List.' " Turan says he's 
among other critics "who want Steven to make the most interesting mainstream 
films he can make with depth, integrity and more concern for character -- all 
the things that make 'Schindler's' such a good film." 
</P>
<P>
 Time magazine movie critic Richard Schickel, noting that if he were in 
Spielberg's shoes he would simply take a year off and not worry about what to 
do next, says it's unfair to expect the director to "now go and make all 
grown-up, serious movies" just because "Schindler's" is such a success. 
</P>
<P>
 "I resent the demands of the public on artists, that we expect someone now to 
do something they may not expect of themselves," he asserts. "If you have 
inordinate success, everyone from your agent to your wife to your best friend 
then expects you to reach a new plateau. The trick is to follow your heart and 
inclinations and let the chips fall where they may." 
</P>
<P>
 Absent of a "towering subject" like the Holocaust, adds Schickel, "the logical 
thing for Steven to do is a smaller, more intense drama with a small cast." 
</P>
<P>
 In any case, Schickel allows, "We should let him alone and let him enjoy his 
commercial and artistic success and let him think it over and follow what his 
inclination is. He has a golden problem. He doesn't have to think where his 
next nickel is coming from." 
</P>
<P>
 Spielberg's handlers say the director won't even begin to focus on what to do 
next until after the Oscars on March 21, a night he will likely long remember.

CLUB REVIEW; STARDUST STILL EXISTS AT THE ATLAS BAR & GRILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HEIDI SIEGMUND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gangster types stroll in off the street, maybe looking for a drink and a 
Charleston partner. Long-haired rockers wearing too-tight jeans and cowboy 
boots mouth the lyrics to "Stay as Sweet as You Are."An elderly gentleman 
delicately holds the hand of a frail woman in a wheelchair as he slowly whisks 
her across the dance floor. 
</P>
<P>
 Sound like a scene from an upcoming David Lynch film? It's actually the 
4-year-old Atlas Bar & Grill in the Wilshire district. Stardust still exists in 
'90s L.A. here every Thursday night, when Johnny Crawford and his 1928 Society 
Dance Orchestra perform music from the late '20s and early '30s. Crawford and 
his seven-member band are so compelling, you feel as if you've literally 
stepped back in time. 
</P>
<P>
 Complemented by the supper club's Art Deco styling, Crawford skillfully draws 
the audience even deeper into the period by pretending that it is 1934. The 
crooner, who played Chuck Connors' son in the "Rifleman" TV series, throws out 
bits of '30s trivia between songs and does a terrific lindy hop and time-step 
dance. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the elements that makes the evening so special is the perfect melding 
of venue and music. The magic doesn't go away when the band takes a respite. 
During breaks, the audience -- many of whom dress in period costume -- is 
treated to obscure music clips of such artists as Billie Holiday, Tommy Dorsey 
and Rita Hayworth on a giant screen. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time Crawford completes his fourth set with a lovely, lilting version 
of "(It Must've Been) Moonglow," you really think it's true. HEIDI SIEGMUND

'KOREAN COMMUNITY' PROJECT GETS GRANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles County Museum of Art has received a $275,000 grant from the 
Korea Foundation for the museum's "Korean Community Education Project," a 
three-year outreach program. 
</P>
<P>
 The project is designed to increase appreciation of Korean art and culture, 
and to promote cultural understanding and interaction among the city's various 
populations. 
</P>
<P>
 Workshops will be held in areas of Los Angeles with a large percentage of 
Korean Americans, as well as in African American and Latino neighborhoods 
affected by Los Angeles' 1992 civil unrest. 
</P>
<P>
 The program's start is tied to the museum's upcoming exhibition, "Korean Arts 
of the 18th Century: Splendor and Simplicity," which runs from June 16 through 
Aug. 28.

THE 66TH ACADEMY AWARD NOMINATIONS; WHAT'S EATING NOMINATED STUDIOS? NOTHING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 It was the day the Oscars were announced and executives at Hollywood's studios 
were wondering how they could capitalize on the avalanche of publicity that 
naturally ensues when a film is nominated. 
</P>
<P>
 For Paramount Pictures, the question was: What to do now that Leonardo 
DiCaprio has been nominated for best supporting actor in a quirky little film 
called "What's Eating Gilbert Grape"? 
</P>
<P>
 Released in mid-December, the film about a dysfunctional family in a small 
Iowa town has been seen only in a few major cities -- a mere 19 screens last 
weekend. Up to that point, it seemed to many industry observers that Paramount 
hadn't a clue how to market the offbeat film starring Johnny Depp as a young 
man torn by his relationships to his 500-pound mother and mentally disabled 
younger brother (DiCaprio). 
</P>
<P>
 But Paramount officials said Wednesday that they have had plans in place for 
some time to put the film on 600 screens on March 4. 
</P>
<P>
 "We felt we needed to go very slow, be very patient to let it find it's 
audience," said Barry London, president of worldwide distribution at Paramount. 
</P>
<P>
 For Disney, the question was: What to do now with the rock 'n' roll drama 
"What's Love Got to Do with It" after Laurence Fishburne and Angela Bassett 
received nominations for best actor and actress? 
</P>
<P>
 The film grossed $39 million domestically by the time it disappeared from most 
screens by summer's end and is scheduled for release on video in late March. A 
Disney spokesman said Wednesday that as a result of the nominations, the movie 
would now be re-released in an "unspecified number of theaters" for an 
"unspecified amount of time." 
</P>
<P>
 For Warner Bros., the question was how to capitalize on success now that its 
summer hit garnered a best picture nomination and a best supporting actor 
nomination for Tommy Lee Jones? 
</P>
<P>
 The Harrison Ford thriller "The Fugitive" had gone out of wide release around 
Christmas. Betting it could garner an Oscar nod or two, Warner Bros. made plans 
long ago to re-release 1,000 prints of "The Fugitive" this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 At Universal Pictures, the question was whether to stay the course? Universal 
had already made plans to have Steven Spielberg's Holocaust drama "Schindler's 
List" in 175 U.S. markets by this date while preparing it for worldwide release 
later this month. The movie has been difficult to distribute because of the 
lack of labs that can produce the black-and-white prints. 
</P>
<P>
 Universal also had plans to increase the number of theaters showing "In the 
Name of the Father" from 150 to 500.

THE 66TH ACADEMY AWARD NOMINATIONS; WHEN RULES WERE MADE TO BE BROKEN; FOREIGN 
FILMS: FOR THIS YEAR'S NOMINEES, THE ACADEMY RELAXED ITS STIPULATION THAT AT 
LEAST HALF THE CREATIVE TEAM SHOULD COME FROM THE COUNTRY OF ORIGIN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Three films nominated by Asian countries dominated the academy's 
foreign-language category Wednesday, and none of them would have been eligible 
for consideration had the organization not decided to bend its new guidelines 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the nominees -- Taiwan's "The Wedding Banquet" -- was shot in New York 
by a New York director and crew. Vietnam's "The Scent of Green Papaya" was 
filmed on a French sound stage. The controversial "Farewell My Concubine" was 
not nominated by China, where it was filmed, but by Hong Kong, where it was 
financed. 
</P>
<P>
 In all three cases, the academy had to relax its stipulation that at least 
half the creative team should come from the country of origin. 
</P>
<P>
 The selections were rife with other paradoxes. "Belle Epoque," a comedy set in 
1930 and centered around a young man's pursuit of four sisters, is Spanish 
despite its French title. " 'Belle Epoque' has the flavor of a lost paradise, 
something in the past that you'd like to revisit," said director Fernando 
Trueba, adding that the film is a homage to French director Jean Renoir. 
</P>
<P>
 The mostly English-speaking United Kingdom was represented among the 
foreign-language nominees with a Welsh film, "Hedd Wyn," directed by Paul 
Turner. A World War I drama, the movie is the only one among the five that has 
yet to find a U.S. distributor. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Rothman, president of worldwide production for the Samuel Goldwyn Co., 
distributor of "The Wedding Banquet," said the strong showing by Asian films is 
not a fluke. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're seeing a flowering of Asian cinema," he said. "It represents a growth, 
not just in movie making opportunities but in the receptivity of American 
audiences to those pictures." Later this year, Goldwyn will release "Eat Drink 
Man Woman," the next film from Ang Lee, director of "Wedding Banquet," and "To 
Live," a new film from Zhang Yimou, a two-time previous Oscar nominee. 
</P>
<P>
 Said "Farewell My Concubine" director Chen Kaige in a statement: "I'm so 
pleased that three of the five nominees in my category are directed by Asian 
filmmakers." 
</P>
<P>
 In another unusual development, two of the nominated films center around 
homosexual characters. "The Wedding Banquet," the top-grossing film in Taiwan's 
history, tells the story of a gay man who marries his female tenant in order to 
hide his homosexuality from his visiting parents. The epic "Farewell My 
Concubine," based on a Hong Kong book, traces the 50-year relationship between 
two male Peking Opera stars. 
</P>
<P>
 Rothman said the gay themes are a further sign of the maturing cinema in what 
are "traditionally thought of as very restrictive societies." 
</P>
<P>
 Traditional Vietnamese culture is the subject of "Papaya," that country's 
first Oscar entry. Set in the 1950s, the movie was shot outside Paris because 
there is virtually no film industry in Vietnam.

THE 66TH ACADEMY AWARD NOMINATIONS; ANGLO-IRISH ACTORS' YEAR FOR OSCAR NODS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The British film industry may be virtually dead, but the United Kingdom 
certainly made its impact felt when the Oscar acting nominations were announced 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Half of the nominees for best actor or best supporting actor went to 
individuals from Britain or Ireland. Nominated for their lead roles were 
Britain's Daniel Day-Lewis, who played the wrongly imprisoned Gerry Conlon in 
"In the Name of the Father"; Welshman Anthony Hopkins, who portrayed a 
repressed butler in "The Remains of the Day"; and Northern Ireland native Liam 
Neeson, who adopted a German accent to play the unlikely industrialist-hero in 
"Schindler's List." 
</P>
<P>
 Two British subjects were recognized in the supporting role category: Ralph 
Fiennes for his portrayal of Nazi commandant Amon Goeth and Peter 
Postlethwaite, who played Conlon's father. 
</P>
<P>
 On the female side, the British influence was less pronounced, yet Emma 
Thompson was nominated in two categories for her work as a model housekeeper in 
"The Remains of the Day" and as a fiery lawyer in "In the Name of the Father." 
Anna Paquin, from the Commonwealth nation of New Zealand, was nominated for her 
role in "The Piano" as the 10-year-old who serves as her mute mother's 
mouthpiece. 
</P>
<P>
 Day-Lewis, Hopkins and Thompson are all previous Oscar winners. 
</P>
<P>
 What's going on? 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking from his native Ireland, Jim Sheridan, a nominee himself in the 
directing category for "In the Name of the Father," said the choices were a 
good reflection of the academy's open-mindedness. He also attributed some of 
the actors' success to the material they were given. 
</P>
<P>
 Ismail Merchant, producer of "The Remains of the Day," said theater training 
is the key to getting an acting nomination. 
</P>
<P>
 "English actors have an extraordinary theater training," he said. "British 
actors are very disciplined. They have a profound knowledge of the characters 
they are playing and exceptional acting ability."

THE 66TH ACADEMY AWARD NOMINATIONS; CAMPION STRIKES RIGHT NOTE WITH ACADEMY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELAINE DUTKA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two years ago, director Barbra Streisand was snubbed in the best director 
category while her "The Prince of Tides" was nominated for best picture. Penny 
Marshall found herself in the same boat the year before with "Awakenings." 
Though Lina Wertmuller's 1976 "Seven Beauties" made her the first woman 
nominated for best director, her film was not a best picture nominee. 
</P>
<P>
 The female jinx, however, has been broken. For the first time a woman -- 
director Jane Campion -- has scored in both categories for "The Piano." 
</P>
<P>
 The element of gender was not lost on the New Zealander -- only the second 
woman in Oscar history to be so honored. "I feel privileged to be in the 
company of such incredible, important filmmakers," Campion said. "And, of 
course, I'm pleased seven of our eight (Oscar) nominations were for women." 
</P>
<P>
 "The Piano," which came into the Oscar balloting with a fistful of critics' 
awards, also landed a best acting nomination for Holly Hunter, a best 
supporting nomination for Anna Paquin and an additional screenplay nomination 
for Campion. The movie's female producer, costume designer and editor were also 
recognized. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that trend is going to translate into a major upset in either the 
best picture or best director category," said Harvey Weinstein, co-chairman of 
Miramax Films, which distributed "The Piano." "We will win one of those two 
categories. I think this is the year the women are going to push 'The Piano' 
over the top." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Janet Yang, president of Oliver Stone's Ixtlan Corp. and executive producer of 
"The Joy Luck Club," believes that the female factor may actually have worked 
in Campion's favor. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think people were quick to recognize this movie because it was directed by 
a woman," she said. "For some, there's the novelty factor, the feeling that, as 
a woman, she's more worthy of recognition.  
</P>
<P>
 "Political correctness also works against us, though. We're trying to line up 
Martha Coolidge to direct a movie about Johnny Spain -- a half-black, 
half-white man sent to prison for murder -- and we're encountering a lot of 
resistance. People accepted her on a so-called 'female' movie like 'Rambling 
Rose' and she was offered 'Little Women.' But when it comes to movies with 
grit, women are still being pigeonholed." 
</P>
<P>
 Others, too, caution against excessive optimism. No American woman has yet 
captured the academy's best director nomination. Three out of this year's best 
picture nominees -- "Schindler's List," "In the Name of the Father" and "The 
Fugitive" -- had virtually no substantive female roles. And Yang's "The Joy 
Luck Club," a critical favorite about three generations of Asian mothers and 
daughters, was overlooked entirely. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had three strikes against us," director Wayne Wang said. "Our cast was 
female, ethnic and devoid of star power. Still, whether conscious or not, I 
think the academy is becoming more accepting of women. Campion's nomination is 
a sign of progress . . . but it's too early to send up any fireworks." 
</P>
<P>
 Holly Hunter, who was also nominated for best supporting actress for her work 
in "The Firm," agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "The best actor categories were really packed," she observed. "The competition 
was so strong there was no room for all the men who should be nominated. Among 
the women, though, they had to give me and Emma (Thompson) two nominations -- a 
pretty strong indication that there were few female roles to be honored. They 
had to stretch it out to cover all bases . . . it was like using Hamburger 
Helper. 
</P>
<P>
 "Generating good parts for women, of course, isn't the responsibility of the 
academy," Hunter concluded. "It doesn't start with them. It ends with them."

AROUND THE SOUTH BAY: SOUTH BAY PAVILION FINDS AN OUTLET FOR ITS 
ENVIRONMENTALISM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 MALL WARS: Just a little over a year ago, developers of the South Bay Pavilion 
in Carson were getting all the attention. 
</P>
<P>
 Ikea, the home furnishing giant, opened in the former Broadway store in what 
was a big boost to revitalizing the mall. The city, in fact, chipped in an 
$8.9-million loan to help the retailer remodel its new digs. 
</P>
<P>
 Things aren't so peachy anymore. 
</P>
<P>
 The city has its sights on the Metro 2000 project, a 180-store outlet mall 
planned just across the San Diego Freeway from the South Bay Pavilion. The city 
will contribute some of its sales tax revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Late last month Carson Mall Partners, owners of the South Bay Pavilion, filed 
suit to stop the project. 
</P>
<P>
 "They contend that the environmental impact report was not complete in dealing 
with the traffic concerns that they have expressed," said City Atty. Glenn 
Watson, who received a copy of the complaint two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
 At outlet malls, stores feature brand-name products at discount prices. A 
shopper might be able to get a pair of loafers much less expensively at Metro 
2000 than the South Bay Pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
 But the lawsuit has nothing to do with competition, said Carson Mall Partners 
attorney Patrick Breen. 
</P>
<P>
 His clients want to make sure there's money to cover cleaning up the former 
landfill site, as well as ways to prevent potential traffic problems. In fact, 
Breen said, outlet centers have been shown to have a positive effect on other 
malls. 
</P>
<P>
 "These things can feed off of each other," Breen said. 
</P>

 SCAVENGER HUNT: Relics from Abalone Cove on the Palos Verdes Peninsula are 
still turning up. 
</P>
<P>
 A longtime resident gave the Rancho Palos Verdes City Council an ancient 
Indian fishhook last week. The item will be turned over to the Point Vicente 
Interpretive Center, which plans to have the item verified and dated with the 
help of the Los Angeles Museum of Natural History. 
</P>
<P>
 But it seems not all donations to councils remain genuine. Up in Rolling 
Hills, council members were preparing a field trip to inspect a rug that one 
resident wanted to give when the offer was suddenly withdrawn. . . . Perhaps he 
discovered a hidden value. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 SHIP SHAPE: It didn't get any attention from the media, but the Jan. 17 
earthquake caused about a dozen shipwrecks in San Pedro. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately, there were no casualties and all it will take to repair the 
damaged ships is a little glue. 
</P>
<P>
 The ships are models of old sailing vessels on display at the Los Angeles 
Maritime Museum on Harbor Boulevard. The temblor shook loose the tops of the 
glass display cases the models are kept in, breaking a few spars and the 
rigging on a dozen models of 19th-Century square-riggers and schooners. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the models are more than half a century old and range in value from 
$4,500 to $10,000. Museum curator Sheli Smith estimated the damage at about 
$1,000 per model. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 TORCHES IN TORRANCE: Every once in a while, Torrance residents are reminded 
that one of their neighbors is, in fact, the Mobil Oil Refinery. 
</P>
<P>
 Flames shot up from a torch-like smokestack on Monday and Tuesday, filling the 
air with black smoke. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was not an industrial accident; the burn was intentional. On Monday 
afternoon, two power interruptions forced the refinery to burn off chemicals 
for about 70 minutes to relieve pressure on its systems. 
</P>
<P>
 The discharge, commonly referred to as "flaring," "is supposed to happen," 
said Mobil spokesman Barry Engelberg. "They're basically like pilot lights on a 
gas stove." 
</P>
<P>
 * QUOTE OF THE WEEK 
</P>
<P>
 "In a wharf fire, you have to bring the boat in right next to the wharf, so 
you're right in the center of the fire, with the smoke all around you. You can 
imagine, it's a little difficult."  
</P>
<P>
 -- Capt. Robert M. Brewis, a commander of Boat 2, which for nearly 70 years 
has been guarding the Port of Los Angeles, ready to fight fire on water.

$30-MILLION INVESTMENT FRAUD CASE GOES TO JURY; COURTS: TWO MONTHS OF TESTIMONY 
CONCLUDE IN FEDERAL CASE AGAINST MORRIS D. ENGLISH. HE IS CHARGED WITH 
SWINDLING 1,500 INVESTORS THROUGH HIS NOW-DEFUNCT WELLINGTON GROUP. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 After more than two months of testimony, a federal court jury will decide 
whether the leader of a now-defunct South Bay investment firm swindled 1,500 
investors out of more than $30 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Final arguments concluded this week in U.S. District Court in the fraud and 
money-laundering trial of Morris D. English, Jr., 46, former head of the 
Wellington Group investment company. 
</P>
<P>
 While about a dozen glaring investors looked on, Assistant U.S. Atty. Jeffrey 
Isaacs told the jury that investors in English's company "entrusted a good 
portion of their life savings to the defendant, and he stole it." Isaacs said 
English used some of the money to "live a lifestyle his victims could only 
dream about," including expensive homes for himself and family members, private 
airplanes and other luxuries. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorney Richard Callahan argued that, although English made mistakes 
in running his company, he never tried to swindle anybody. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mistakes were made here," Callahan told the jurors. "(English) is the first 
to admit it." But he added, "Were his actions criminal? Not on your life -- and 
more importantly, not on his life." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 English could be sentenced to 450 years in prison if convicted on all 51 
counts in the indictment. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside court, some of the investors who lost money, many of them retirees, 
spoke bitterly of their losses. 
</P>
<P>
 "He ruined our lives, our children's inheritance," said Eleanor Sturman of 
Burbank, who said she lost $194,000. "He took away everything a lot of these 
people had. We've got old people who are eating dog food because of him." 
</P>
<P>
 According to prosecutors, the case began in 1984, when English purchased a 
dormant Manhattan Beach company called Wellington Escrow Corp. for $7,000. 
English later changed the name to The Wellington Group, moved to Rolling Hills 
Estates and began making short-term, interest-only loans to borrowers who 
secured the loans with real estate. 
</P>
<P>
 To fund the loans, prosecutors said, English solicited money from investors, 
promising them a 15% to 16% return on their investment. English advertised on 
radio and investors from across the country invested millions. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors say the company eventually evolved into a classic "Ponzi scheme," 
with new investors' money being used to pay off old investors. Meanwhile, 
prosecutors allege, English diverted investors' funds for his personal use.  
</P>
<P>
 In 1990 the California Department of Corporations obtained a preliminary 
injunction to prevent Wellington from selling unqualified securities. The 
company later filed for bankruptcy, and, according to prosecutors, illegally 
omitted investors' names from the list of creditors so the investors wouldn't 
find out about it. English also concealed or destroyed numerous records 
concerning the company, prosecutors charge. 
</P>
<P>
 Some investors say they didn't know anything was wrong until the interest 
payments on their investments abruptly stopped. By then it was too late to get 
their money back. 
</P>
<P>
 The company's collapse sparked civil lawsuits involving hundreds of investors. 
The company has been placed in the hands of a court-appointed trustee who has 
been selling its remaining assets to pay off investors. Some investors say they 
may get back 10 or 15 cents on the dollar -- if that. 
</P>
<P>
 English's criminal court troubles began in 1991, when he was charged in 
Torrance with eight counts of grand theft and writing bad checks to investors. 
In a plea bargain he agreed to make good on the checks, but was later arrested 
for failing to do so. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, federal agents were investigating his business affairs. English was 
arrested in May on the federal charges and has been held in federal custody 
ever since. 
</P>
<P>
 Testifying in his own defense, English denied that he ever tried to mislead 
investors. At times combative, he blamed many of his company's troubles on 
overzealous regulators, once referring to a state Department of Corporations 
official as a "DOC Nazi."

SKI FILM COMPANY IS HEADING FOR WHITER PASTURES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES BENNING, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Warren Miller's ski films have dazzled powder-hungry skiers for more than 40 
years, but his company's South Bay headquarters has left most scratching their 
snow-capped heads. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, the movie company that focused on subfreezing fun settled in the 
warm, sunny climes of Hermosa Beach, where locals wax surfboards, not skis. 
</P>
<P>
 But Warren Miller Entertainment will move Friday from its offices on Pier 
Avenue, where nary a snowflake has fallen in decades, to Boulder, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're probably one of the only Southern California film companies that would 
move and people wouldn't ask, 'Why Colorado?' " said Peter Speek, who, with 
Miller's son, Kurt, bought the company from the elder Miller five years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 In ski circles, Miller, 70, is a movie mogul. His company has turned out a 
feature-length ski film every fall for 44 years.  
</P>
<P>
 The latest, "Warren Miller's Black Diamond Rush," was released last year to 
packed auditoriums in the United States, Canada, Europe and Australia.  
</P>
<P>
 Miller started the company in 1949 in Hollywood and moved first to Palos 
Verdes and then to Hermosa Beach in 1962 to be close to the ocean for surfing 
and sailing. "I like the mountains," he said, "but not as much in the summer." 
</P>
<P>
 The company once required a headquarters near Hollywood production studios so 
the films could be edited and quickly returned to the offices. Not anymore. 
</P>
<P>
 These days, the company can deliver packages to Hollywood editing rooms using 
overnight couriers and scripts can be sent by fax. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, employees can work at the base of the Rocky Mountains. It's a 
case of the information superhighway meeting the information chair lift. 
</P>
<P>
 Much has changed since the early days. Miller made his first film using a $200 
hand-held Bell & Howell camera. Today, the company uses 15 Arriflex cameras, 
each costing about $30,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The film's settings have become more exotic. A film crew left this week for 
India, where it will film Americans skiing from helicopters in the Himalaya 
Mountains. The footage likely will be used in next year's movie. 
</P>
<P>
 And Miller no longer provides live, witty play-by-play at the movies' hundreds 
of screenings around the country. Now he writes the films' scripts at his home 
in Vail, Colo., and records them on tape. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the changes, the films' essence remains, Speek said. "Even when 
Warren's voice is prerecorded on tape, you still get a sense that he is sitting 
across the table telling you about his ski vacation," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Twelve of the company's 13 employees will make the move. Many are raising 
families, a task that may be easier in Colorado, Speek said. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller, meanwhile, is writing a book about his sporting experiences, due out 
in September. He skis nearly every day in the winter. 
</P>
<P>
 He's likely to join the company's employees in early March for a "company ski 
day." Speek expects them all to spend more time on the slopes. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're absolutely excited," he said.

PRENATAL CARE PROGRAM IS TRUE LABOR OF LOVE FOR FORMER NURSE; HEALTH: ZOLA 
JONES HAS RETIRED, BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN SHE'S SLOWED DOWN. SHE'S STILL 
FOCUSING HER ENERGIES ON THE GREAT BEGINNINGS FOR BLACK BABIES PROGRAM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Everything, it seems, is a family affair to Zola Jones. 
</P>
<P>
 For more than 30 years, families have been her career. A public health nurse 
since 1961, Jones retired last fall as family planning specialist for Los 
Angeles County's Department of Public Health. But that doesn't mean she has 
stopped working. 
</P>
<P>
 Retirement means she can spend more time on Great Beginnings for Black Babies, 
which she co-founded in 1990. The volunteer-run prenatal care campaign is 
designed to stop the spiraling infant mortality rate among African Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones volunteers most of her time to making Great Beginnings bigger, more 
financially secure and accessible to more women. The program recently opened a 
branch in the Hawthorne Mall.  
</P>
<P>
 "I used to get up at 4:30 a.m. to be at work by 6 a.m. and go for 12 or 14 
hours because I was also trying to get Great Beginnings started," she said. 
"Now I get up a little bit later." 
</P>
<P>
 The 56-year-old woman with a passion for family has never been married and has 
no children. 
</P>
<P>
 She's a favorite aunt, the one who sneaked you extra cookies when mom wasn't 
looking. Her brown eyes magnified by owl-rimmed glasses, Jones rarely speaks 
first and always says "we did" rather than "I did." She smiles widely and often 
and laughs generously, her shoulders shaking as if she's been seized by a 
sneeze.  
</P>
<P>
 "I've always looked to Zola as the impeccable warrior," Caswell A. Evans Jr. 
of the county Department of Health Services, said in a speech at an 
appreciation dinner recently to honor Jones' decades of work in public health. 
"She is a person with a fire in the belly and a vision in the eye." 
</P>
<P>
 Since her retirement, that vision is sharply focused on one thing: "If 
everything could be right in the world," Jones said, "everybody would have 
prenatal care. There would be no barriers for women to get help, and every baby 
would have the chance to be born healthy." 
</P>
<P>
 Many children don't have that chance. California's infant mortality rate 
hovers at nearly 7%, Department of Health statistics show, but the rate for 
black babies is more than 16%. 
</P>
<P>
 Great Beginnings, offered in collaboration with Daniel Freeman Memorial 
Hospital in Inglewood, gives pregnant women the information they need to keep 
themselves and their babies healthy. They are taught not to drink, smoke or 
take drugs when pregnant and are given information on nutrition, exercise and 
basic anatomy.  
</P>
<P>
 "Our goal is to see Great Beginnings connected with all the major hospitals," 
Jones said from her bare-walled office at the Hawthorne clinic that still has 
chalky dust and the smell of new carpet in the air. 
</P>
<P>
 County and state health care experts say Great Beginnings has made a 
difference in public awareness. They point to Jones' subtle way of connecting 
the right people as a cornerstone of the program's success. 
</P>
<P>
 "She knows . . . all those things one needs to get a major task done," said 
Great Beginnings co-founder Dr. Virginia Hunt. "She doesn't quit until it is 
finished." 
</P>
<P>
 "Zola has always been at the forefront in maintaining quality care in family 
planning," said Geri Nibbs, a nurse consultant for the state Department of 
Health Services who has known Jones for 15 years. "She has a way of pulling 
people behind her." 
</P>
<P>
 The youngest of eight children whose mother died when she was 12, Jones was 
raised by her father, who worked in a sawmill near Marion, Ala.  
</P>
<P>
 Life wasn't easy for this quiet girl who liked to read. But buoyed by love and 
faith and money from brothers and sisters, extended family, friends, neighbors 
and church, Jones received a nursing diploma from Grady Memorial Hospital 
School of Nursing in Atlanta. Later, she earned bachelor's and master's degrees 
in nursing and public administration from Cal State Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 She started nursing in a newborn nursery in a Cleveland hospital because she 
loved the tiny patients. They were cute and they didn't complain, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But after one bitter winter, Jones followed friends west to warmer climes. She 
made her home first in Long Beach and then Hawthorne, devoting her off-duty 
energies to the nursing sorority Chi Eta Phi, the Council of Black Nurses and 
the Nurses Guild at Messiah Baptist Church in the Crenshaw district. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to give something back," she said. "I have always just thought I 
wanted to help." 
</P>
<P>
 Evidently she has. At her appreciation dinner at the Hilton, Jones received 
certificates of commendation from the public health services, the Assembly and 
state Senate, Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors, the Inglewood City 
Council and the March of Dimes Birth Defects Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know where I'm going to put these," Jones confided afterward with a 
laugh, pleased and a little embarrassed. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that she takes much time to worry about wall space. One problem eclipses 
all others. "Infant mortality is a major problem throughout the nation," Jones 
said, "but like Martin Luther King said, 'We shall overcome.' "

COMMUNITY NEWS: GARDENA: NEW YMCA WILL DOUBLE THE SIZE OF CURRENT FACILITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IRIS YOKOI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Construction is expected to begin this summer on the new Gardena-Carson Family 
YMCA facility at Vermont Avenue and Artesia Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 The building will nearly double the space at the 30-year-old YMCA facility on 
Redondo Beach Boulevard. The local YMCA, which experienced a 12% jump in 
membership last year, outgrew its 15,500-square-foot facility several years 
ago, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The new 33,500-square-foot building will have a large indoor swimming pool, 
locker rooms, and expanded parking and child-care facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 The indoor pool will allow the YMCA to give swimming classes year round. The 
additional space also will allow increased enrollment in the Y's day-care and 
indoor basketball and soccer programs. 
</P>
<P>
 About 3,000 youths participate in the Y's programs each year, and 200 families 
and 300 individuals have annual memberships, said George Saikali, executive 
director. 
</P>
<P>
 Membership fees will rise slightly when the new building opens in 1995. An 
individual membership that is now $16 monthly will go up to about $20, while 
families now paying about $20 monthly will pay $23 to $36, Saikali said. 
</P>
<P>
 YMCA supporters have already secured $3 million in pledges toward the $3.5 
million cost of the new building. Operating the facility will cost about $1 
million a year. 
</P>
<P>
 The land is owned by the city of Gardena, which bought the 3.3 acres from 
Caltrans for $1.4 million. In a lease purchase agreement approved by the 
Gardena City Council Tuesday night, the YMCA will pay the city $56,000 a year. 
Each January, the rent will be adjusted to equal the city's rate of return if 
the city had invested the $1.4 million in an interest-earning fund. Once it 
pays off the $1.4 million, the YMCA can obtain title to the site. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the city will help the YMCA sell its Redondo Beach Boulevard 
facility. If the YMCA has not sold the facility when the new one opens, the 
city will buy the old property for up to $2.5 million. IRIS YOKOI

SHOWING SOME HEART; TRANSPORTATION: FATHER-SON TEAM HELPS MAKE THE DAILY 
COMMUTE MORE BEARABLE BY ERECTING COLORFUL LIGHTED SCULPTURES NEAR A FREEWAY 
ARTERY. THEIR LATEST CREATION COMMEMORATES VALENTINE'S DAY. 
</P>

<P>
 From dusk to dawn, the 24-foot glowing red heart pierced by an enormous white 
arrow looms above the Harbor and Redondo freeway interchange. 
</P>
<P>
 Etched against the night sky, the sculpture -- illuminated by nearly 300 
lights -- is a Valentine's Day greeting from Jesse and Bud Gardner. 
</P>
<P>
 It's the latest in a series of seasonal sculptures erected to amuse the 
thousands of motorists driving past the interchange every day. 
</P>
<P>
 The art is the work of Jesse Gardner, 44, president of the California Fence & 
Supply Co., and his father, Bud, 67, a retired furniture manufacturer.  
</P>
<P>
 "It all started when dad and I created a 20-foot Christmas tree out of bent 
square tubing and covered it with 350 Christmas lights and hoisted it onto the 
roof of our building next to the freeway in December, 1992," Jesse Gardner 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 Since then, the Gardners and 14 employees of the fence company have displayed 
giant metal sculptures on the roof saluting special days or seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 The sculptures are visible during the day, but after dark, in the brilliant 
glow of lights, the figures attract the greatest attention. 
</P>
<P>
 First a mammoth shamrock commemorated St. Patrick's Day, then a bunny and 
basket of eggs for Easter and later a 20-foot sombrero for Cinco de Mayo. 
</P>
<P>
 For Mother's Day it was a huge floral arrangement, gigantic lilies for 
Memorial Day, a 23-foot necktie for Father's Day, an enormous birthday cake 
topped with five candles shaped like firecrackers for the 4th of July. 
</P>
<P>
 For Labor Day there was a 21-foot beach umbrella shading a pot-bellied man in 
a hammock, a ship for Columbus Day, a giant pumpkin with a Betty Boop face for 
Halloween. 
</P>
<P>
 A cross-eyed, bow-legged turkey was there for Thanksgiving. That was followed 
by another Christmas tree and an anchor saluting the about-to-be-closed Long 
Beach Naval Station. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 All the works are supported by nearly invisible stainless steel guy wires. The 
sculptures are set up several days before a holiday and remain in place several 
days after the occasion. 
</P>
<P>
 "Driving the freeways isn't much fun. This is our way to add a smile or two to 
the daily commute," said Jesse Gardner. 
</P>
<P>
 Although motorists are not aware who erects the art, the fence company has 
received phone calls and letters of appreciation for the fanciful sculptures. 
</P>
<P>
 A letter from Gardena signed by Linda Marie Alvarez and Gabriel Torres 
expressed these sentiments: 
</P>
<P>
 "In this day and age when graffiti seems to be the most popular form of 
expression, your choice of lighting up each season is greatly appreciated."

 Faced with declining ranks of volunteers, a relief agency is asking South Bay 
residents to help victims of the Jan. 17 earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 The Volunteerism Project, a nonprofit agency directing relief efforts in 
greater Los Angeles, said it still needs workers to help with the medical, 
psychological and housing needs of residents hit hard by the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 But as the aftershocks have subsided, the number of volunteers working with 
the agency has dwindled, spokeswoman Suzanne Lewis said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's still a tremendous need for volunteers," Lewis said. "The crisis 
isn't over." 
</P>
<P>
 To volunteer: (800) 908-5170.

 The weight room at Junipero Serra High School was scheduled to be named the 
Darrell Eugene Harts Memorial Weight Room at a special school ceremony 
Wednesday night, in honor of the Serra alumnus who was killed in a police 
shooting last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Harts, who graduated from Serra in 1980, was killed in April in South-Central 
Los Angeles by two Los Angeles police officers who said he fired a pistol at 
them first.But Harts' family and friends have challenged the police accounts, 
arguing that the 30-year-old Harts would never have fired at police because he 
was trying to become a police officer himself. 
</P>
<P>
 Harts graduated from the Rio Hondo College police academy, was at the top of 
the list of potential recruits for the Compton Police Department and was 
working as a security guard at the time of his death. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday, county prosecutors announced they would not file criminal charges 
against the two officers, despite finding inconsistencies in the officers' 
account. Prosecutors said there was insufficient evidence to refute the 
officers' claim of self-defense. 
</P>
<P>
 The announcement came two days before Harts' family and Serra officials had 
scheduled the weight room dedication ceremony in the school's gym at 14830 S. 
Van Ness Ave., before the Serra-St. Monica High basketball game. 
</P>
<P>
 Harts' family and Cal State Northridge fraternity brothers presented a 
memorial banner to be hung at the school and announced the establishment of a 
scholarship fund in Harts' name.  
</P>
<P>
 Harts played football at Serra, Cal State Northridge and Utah's Weber State 
University, where he earned a bachelor's degree in criminal justice. 
</P>
<P>
 Harts' brother Don said he and his parents initially sought to name Serra's 
football field after his brother but learned it was already dedicated in 
someone else's name. IRIS YOKOI

 Marymount College in Rancho Palos Verdes will shuttle area public school 
students to a place where they can catch an MTA bus. 
</P>
<P>
 At a City Council meeting last week, the college proposed two morning pickups 
for up to 75 Palos Verdes Peninsula High School students who live in the 
college area. They would be taken to Miraleste Plaza where they could take the 
Metropolitan Transportation Authority bus on Route 225. In the afternoon, the 
shuttle would make three pickups at the plaza.

 The trial program is scheduled to begin later this month. SUSAN WOODWARD

 James Stroup was later charged with the murder of his wife but was acquitted 
in a jury trial. Police then linked the Leach brothers to the crime. Both were 
convicted in the case and given life sentences. Peter Leach testified that 
Seawright hired him to kill both Catherine and James Stroup, but the husband 
escaped death because he wasn't at home when the attack occurred.

 Seawright's first trial ended in a mistrial when the jury could not agree on a 
verdict. Seawright has maintained his innocence throughout both trials and has 
filed a notice of appeal in the case.

COMMUNITY NEWS: CARSON: 3 HURT IN OIL FIRE AT UNOCAL REFINERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Oil residue in a waste-water area caught fire at the Unocal Refinery on 
Tuesday, injuring three workers, fire officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County Fire Inspector Brian Jordan said the fire sent a black 
cloud of smoke into the air that could be seen for miles. The fire in the 
30-by-100-foot area was extinguished by 40 firefighters in about 30 minutes, 
Jordan said.  
</P>
<P>
 Three workers were treated for minor injuries at Bay Harbor Hospital in Harbor 
City. 
</P>
<P>
 One worker's helmet caught fire, but he was able to get it off before he was 
seriously hurt, Jordan said, adding, "He was pretty lucky." 
</P>
<P>
 Damage was estimated at $100,000. The cause of the fire is under 
investigation.

 The City Council approved a $100,000 settlement last week with a girl who was 
injured while riding her bicycle on a city sidewalk two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Michelle Bowman was 7 when she hit a crack in the sidewalk and was thrown over

handled her lawsuit.The crack in the sidewalk had been pointed out to city 
officials at least two years before the accident, Sauler said. 
</P>
<P>
 The girl, who worked as a model, had to cancel jobs because of her injury and 
will suffer some permanent damage to the range of motion of her elbow, Sauler 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement must still be approved by a judge, but no date for a hearing has 
been set, Sauler said. When the agreement is final, the funds remaining after 
paying medical bills and attorney fees will be put into a trust account for 
Bowman until she turns 18. MARY GUTHRIE

DISCLOSURE: REDONDO BEACH POLICY ON LETTERS AND THE PUBLIC'S RIGHT TO KNOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Last year, a letter written on the official city stationery of Redondo Beach 
Mayor Brad Parton appeared in a Long Beach judge's file to request leniency for 
Parton's mayoral and California Assembly campaign manager. As a result of this 
and other letters, the campaign manager, who was convicted of lewd conduct with 
a minor, avoided a jail sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 This caused quite a stir in Redondo Beach. Mayor Parton admits writing a 
letter for his manager, but said he thought that the charge was driving under 
the influence. He also said the letter he wrote was not the one in the judge's 
file. He states that he had sent blank stationery to the manager, who then 
drafted a new letter. 
</P>
<P>
 In response to this, the Redondo Beach City Council voted on Dec. 21 that no 
blank letterhead be given to any person or group, and if information is 
requested from an outside group for a letter, it should be delivered on blank 
paper and copied on city letterhead by the council member, mayor or their 
assistant. 
</P>
<P>
 On Jan. 18, the city attorney informed the mayor and council members that they 
did not have to open their letter files to the public. On Feb. 1, the city 
attorney recommended the guidelines for public disclosure including 1) that 
requests for records must be specific, focused and limited to a reasonable 
amount of information; and 2) that requested records be screened to avoid 
disclosure of material which would intrude on decision-making. Item 2 is 
sufficiently broad to prevent access to too many letters. Item 1 severely 
restricts the public's right to know by making it possible to view only what 
one already knows exists. 
</P>
<P>
 With the above guidelines, Redondo Beach will not have the open-letter policy 
enjoyed by Hermosa Beach and Manhattan Beach. Redondo Beach residents should 
call or write their council member and mayor concerning this and also attend 
the Feb. 15 council meeting at 6:30 p.m. to participate in public discussion.

STILL READY TO DO BATTLE; HISTORY: THE OLDEST OPERATING FIREBOAT WEST OF THE 
MISSISSIPPI, KNOWN TO ITS CREWS AS BOAT 2, WILL SOON MOVE INTO ITS NEW HOME, A 
$12-MILLION STATION AT SAN PEDRO'S BERTH 86. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GORDON DILLOW, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For nearly 70 years, it has been guarding the Port of Los Angeles, ready to 
fight fire on water. 
</P>
<P>
 Officially the fireboat is known as the Ralph J. Scott, but most of the 
firefighters in the Los Angeles Fire Department simply refer to it as Boat 2, 
because it replaced the first big fireboat, which was retired. Built in Los 
Angeles in 1925, Boat 2 is 99 feet, 6 inches of old-time craftsmanship rendered 
in steel, an official National Historic Landmark that also serves as the oldest 
operating fireboat west of the Mississippi. 
</P>
<P>
 For eight years, Boat 2 has been, in effect, homeless, exposed to the elements 
while still performing firefighting duties. That will soon change, when Boat 2 
moves into its new digs, a $12-million boathouse and fire station at Berth 86 
near the Maritime Museum on Harbor Boulevard in San Pedro. 
</P>
<P>
 It's been almost two decades since a catastrophic explosion and fire occurred 
in the Port of Los Angeles. Port officials say that safety record is partly due 
to tightened fire safety restrictions, and partly to good luck. But the 
potential for disaster is always there. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot of weird things coming up and down that channel," says Edward 
Stephens, emergency preparedness coordinator for the Port of Los Angeles. "As 
in any port, you have flammable liquids, gases, all kinds of things. When you 
think of the quantity of the hazard, it's testimony to the effectiveness of the 
port in monitoring the situation, and making sure everybody plays by the rules, 
that there hasn't been a major fire in so long. The hazard has been reduced -- 
not completely eliminated, but significantly reduced." 
</P>
<P>
 Because the hazard can never be eliminated, Boat 2 -- and the other city Fire 
Department units assigned to the harbor area -- are on duty 24 hours a day. If 
fire erupts on the miles of old wooden wharves that line the port, Boat 2 will 
be there, shooting 18,000 gallons of water a minute on the blaze. If a fire 
breaks out on a cruise ship moored at the World Cruise Center, Boat 2 and its 
eight-man crew will be on hand to help fight it. If a major oil tanker or tank 
farm explodes in the port area -- an event that could equal a small earthquake 
in its destructive power -- Boat 2 will be ready. 
</P>
<P>
 Boat 2 is just one of five fireboats stationed in the port. The 33-year-old, 
76-foot Boat 4 guards the port's East Basin, and three 34-foot fireboats are 
stationed throughout the port. The area also has seven land-based fire 
companies. (Plans for another large fireboat to supplement the others have been 
put on hold because of budget considerations.) 
</P>
<P>
 But because it's the oldest and the biggest and the most powerful fireboat in 
the fleet, Boat 2, to the men who operate it, is more than just another 
fireboat. From the eat-off-the-deck clean engine room to the gleaming stainless 
steel water cannons topside, Boat 2 is special. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's unique," said pilot Mike Corcoran, an ex-Navy diver and 24-year Fire 
Department veteran, who serves as one of three pilots assigned to Boat 2 on a 
rotating basis. "The quality was built into her way back when she was built, 
and it's still there." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like a lot of things that were built a long time ago, there was a lot of 
craftsmanship that went into it," agrees Capt. Robert M. Brewis, a 33-year Fire 
Department veteran and for the past eight years a commander of Boat 2.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Built at Los Angeles Shipbuilding and Drydock for $214,000 and launched in 
October, 1925, Boat 2 was the first of the steel fireboats in the harbor, and 
just part of a vastly expanded port firefighting program devised by Ralph J. 
Scott, chief engineer and general manager of the city's Fire Department from 
1919 to 1939. (Boat 2 was officially named the Ralph J. Scott in 1965.) 
</P>
<P>
 Boat 2 was perhaps the most impressive fireboat of its day, with five water 
cannon turrets that, initially, could spray 13,500 gallons of seawater per 
minute onto a blaze. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after launching, Boat 2 moved into a beautiful, pale-yellow wooden 
boathouse on Terminal Island -- near the current site of the Vincent Thomas 
Bridge -- one of the first such fireboat houses in the country. A barn-sized 
building constructed over water, it was three stories tall to accommodate Boat 
2's highest water-gun turret.  
</P>
<P>
 Boat 2 has a long history of battling tragedy: a wharf fire in 1941 that 
consumed warehouses and 1,200 feet of wharves; a fish cannery fire in Fish 
Harbor in 1943; a 1944 flash fire that engulfed two Navy ships and killed 16 
men; the explosion of the tanker Markay at Berth 167 in Wilmington in 1947, 
which killed 11 people and forced Boat 2 to plow through a sea of burning 
gasoline and butane to fight the blaze. There were countless other, smaller 
fires. 
</P>
<P>
 By the late 1960s Boat 2 was getting old, and plans were made to scrap it and 
build another. But Fire Department officials decided to refit Boat 2. It 
emerged from the remodeling with all the latest equipment: hydraulic water 
cannon turrets, underwater maneuvering jets and large capacity "under-wharf 
nozzles." 
</P>
<P>
 Wharf fires are almost impossible to fight from above, so the nozzles spray 
water from the boat's waterline up through the wooden pilings that support the 
wharf. At the same time, Fire Department divers in scuba gear, operating off 
the smaller fireboats, swim under the wharf to set up spraying hoses to keep 
the fire from spreading. 
</P>
<P>
 The refit also beefed up Boat 2's water pumping capabilities, giving it the 
biggest gallon-per-minute pumping capacity of any fireboat in the nation: 
18,000 gallons per minute, which means it could fill an average swimming pool 
in one minute. Big Bertha, Boat 2's most powerful water cannon, can send a 
stream of water 470 feet, about 1 1/2 football fields. 
</P>
<P>
 It needed that kind of fire power -- or water power -- in 1976, when the 
810-foot Liberian-registered oil tanker Sansinena exploded at Berth 46 with 
such force that it broke windows in Costa Mesa, 21 miles away, and rattled 
buildings in Glendale. The explosion killed nine men and caused $22 million in 
damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly thereafter, the Fire Department instituted new fire inspection 
regulations for tanker ships. There have been no major tanker explosions in the 
port since then.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Firefighters say tougher fire regulations and inspections have made the port 
safer, even though the tonnage of flammable materials passing through the port 
has increased dramatically over the past two decades. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been very fortunate," Brewis says. "But you have to be ready. You do 
everything you can to prevent it, but accidents can happen. An earthquake could 
split the tanks at a tank farm open, or lightning could strike. Things happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Things do happen, and if the fires Boat 2 has fought in recent years aren't as 
dramatic as the tanker explosions of years past, they were plenty dramatic 
enough for the people caught up in them, and the firefighters who put them out. 
Although no fireboat crew member has ever been killed while fighting a fire in 
the port, at times the job can get a little hairy.  
</P>
<P>
 Six years ago, for example, a fire charred 300 feet of wharf and destroyed or 
damaged six commercial fishing boats at Berth 73. Boat 2 put it out. 
</P>
<P>
 "In a wharf fire, you have to bring the boat in right next to the wharf," said 
Brewis, "so you're right in the center of the fire, with the smoke all around 
you. You can imagine, it's a little difficult. It takes a lot of skill on the 
pilot's part. On everyone's part. . . . When we have something happen, there's 
a potential for it to be very big." 
</P>
<P>
 Boat 2 handles about 10 emergencies a month, less than it was handling 20 or 
30 years ago. In addition to fires, Boat 2 is also called out for search and 
rescue, environmental problems such as oil spills, and more routine 
assignments, such as pumping water out of sinking boats. Occasionally it has 
been called out to look for people who were thought to have jumped off the 
Vincent Thomas Bridge; once the crew helped recover the bodies of a woman and 
her four children after she drove her van off a wharf and into the channel. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It's a varied life for Boat 2's 24 crew members. There are three platoons -- 
A, B and C -- assigned to the boat. Each platoon has a captain, a pilot, a 
mate, two engineers to run the engines and three firefighters. All are men, 
although there have been female crew members in the past. Each platoon works 
about 56 hours a week. 
</P>
<P>
 Crew members say they wouldn't want to do anything else. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the best job in the department," said Corcoran. "When I first joined the 
department I never dreamed I'd ever get to be a pilot. There are only six of 
them" -- that is, three assigned to each of the department's two large boats -- 
"and once people get on the boats they don't want to leave. It's a great job." 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been here 10 years, and I'll stay as long as I can," said B Platoon 
Engineer John Rasmussen, a 32-year department veteran. 
</P>
<P>
 For eight years, ever since the old boathouse was torn down in 1986 to make 
way for port expansion, Boat 2 crew members have had to make do with a 
temporary station and living quarters in some modular buildings near Boat 2's 
slip. During that time, the boat has had to be left in the open, exposed to the 
elements.  
</P>
<P>
 And as every boat owner knows, boats equal maintenance. In the past year, Boat 
2 has had its decks scraped and repainted three times by crew members. 
</P>
<P>
 As Capt. David Jones, a platoon commander on Boat 4, the 76-foot Bethel F. 
Gifford, puts it, "When you're assigned to the fireboats you spend a lot of 
time chasing rust." 
</P>
<P>
 Firehouse living conditions and on-board maintenance schedules should improve 
dramatically in August or September, when Boat 2's new boathouse is completed. 
The 18,000-square-foot boathouse and fire station will offer more spacious 
living quarters for the crew, and a viewing area so visitors can see the 
historic fireboat -- it was named a National Historic Landmark in 1990 -- when 
it's berthed. The covered slip will protect the boat from the elements. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, at age 69, Boat 2 is no young whippersnapper. How much longer can it 
last? 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this boat can operate for another 50 years," Brewis said confidently. 
"Maybe even more." On the Cover 
</P>
<P>
 For nearly 70 years, the fireboat Ralph J. Scott has been standing guard 
against conflagrations in the Port of Los Angeles. Better known to firefighters 
as simply Boat 2, it is the oldest operating fireboat west of the Mississippi 
River. The Fire Department is building a new home for Boat 2, a $12-million 
boathouse and station at Berth 86 near the Maritime Museum on Harbor Boulevard 
in San Pedro.

EPA CHARGES 2 FIRMS IN RELEASE OF TOXINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Geron Furniture Inc. of Torrance and Plastiglide Manufacturing Corp., a 
plastic and metal components maker in Hawthorne, have been charged with failing 
to report the release of toxic chemicals into the atmosphere, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is seeking $34,000 in fines from each 
company. Federal law requires companies to disclose the use of more than 300 
industrial chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
 Spokesmen for both companies, however, said the agency's complaints are 
incorrect because the required reports were filed.  
</P>
<P>
 "I think this whole thing is a mistake by the EPA," said Steve Hsu, business 
manager for Plastiglide. "We did not violate any rule." 
</P>
<P>
 Both companies have until the end of this month to formally challenge or 
settle the claims.

 Inside the Purple Rose, a large restaurant with a soaring purple ceiling, the 
open kitchen is run by chef Ken Barnoski and his sous-chef, Theodore Miller. 
The two have much in common, such as knowing at an early age they wanted to be 
chefs. Barnoski knew so early that he lied about his age to get a job at 
Valentino in Santa Monica. He went on to several other restaurants and was 
recently chef for Michael Bolton on the singer's last tour. Miller joined the 
Navy and became the personal chef for the captain of the aircraft carrier 
Constellation. The biggest influence on Miller's cooking has been Thomas 
Keller, under whom he worked at Checkers Hotel downtown. Barnoski credits 
Michael Roberts of Trumps for boosting his career. 
</P>
<P>
 The Purple Rose bills itself as contemporary international, and the list of 
appetizers backs that up. You can get starters from India ( samosas -- filo 
turnovers filled with spinach and potatoes, $3.95), China ( shiu mai -- steamed 
dumplings filled with turkey, $5.95), Italy ( bonata -- pizza dough with olive 
oil, garlic and oregano, $2.95), Mexico (chicken quesadilla, $5.95) and America 
(crab cakes, $6.95). 
</P>
<P>
 Baked in a wood-fired brick oven, the thin 10" pizzas are good and chewy. The 
wild mushroom pizza ($9.50) is brushed with thyme and olive oil and liberally 
strewn with shiitake, oyster and porcini mushrooms, so rich in flavor you might 
think the chef must have smuggled some beef onto the pie.  
</P>
<P>
 The most popular dish is the New Orleans gumbo ($8.95), made with rock shrimp, 
sausage and chicken on a bed of rice or fettuccine. Another big seller is the 
thick slab of meatloaf ($7.95) with mashed potatoes. 
</P>
<P>
 Breakfast highlights include a spinach omelet with smoked Gouda ($5.95) and 
scrambled eggs with pesto and grilled Black Forest ham ($6.95). Something, no 
doubt, Dr. Suess would order. 
</P>
<P>
 Purple Rose is at 2701 190th St., Redondo Beach. 370-1097. Open Sunday through 
Thursday 8 a.m. to 10 p.m., and Friday and Saturday 8 a.m. to midnight. MICHAEL

<P>
 Curator Jan Napolitan said she was surprised to learn how practical ceramics 
could be. Industrial ceramics, when fired at 5,000 degrees, can be much 
stronger than steel. 
</P>
<P>
 "The resulting pieces are just beautiful," said Napolitan. And there is little 
friction between parts and, over time, very little wear. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the items are auto engines that weigh 40% less than current motors and 
use 30% less fuel, a hammer that can chip concrete, knives and scissors that 
never need sharpening, ball bearings that do not require lubrication, implants 
to replace deteriorating joints, and a cone from a Patriot Missile that was 
used in the Gulf War. 
</P>
<P>
 Alongside these practical things are works by four artists. The pieces fetch 
up to $8,000 apiece, but a visit to the gallery is free. 
</P>
<P>
 Where: Palos Verdes Art Center, 5504 W. Crestridge Road, Rancho Palos Verdes. 
</P>
<P>
 When: Monday through Saturday, 1 to 4 p.m., through Feb. 26. 
</P>
<P>
 Who: All ages welcome. 
</P>
<P>
 How much: Free.

 The Los Angeles City Council has approved the sale of the Sheraton San Pedro 
to Singapore-based CP/Forward in the hope of keeping the struggling 230-room 
hotel from closing. 
</P>
<P>
 The $11.8-million sale was finalized with the help of the city's Community 
Redevelopment Agency, which paved the way for the 10-story hotel to be built 
three years ago.

<P>
 South Bay educators received more than $110,000 in cash and donated equipment 
last week from the local chapter of the Japan Business Assn., a nonprofit 
alliance of Japanese companies operating in the Southland. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials representing 46 area schools and educational organizations accepted 
the donations in a ceremony in Torrance that drew leaders from several major 
Japanese businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the items given were computers, compact disc and laser disc players, 
supplies and $55,000 cash, said Rica Hirota, deputy director of the 
association. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the group's members send their children to public and private schools 
in the South Bay, Hirota said. "This is our way of showing appreciation to the 
schools for providing a high-quality education for our kids," she said. SCOTT

COMMUNITY NEWS: LAWNDALE: TRUSTEES REJECT CLAIM OF STRIP-SEARCHED BOY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY GUTHRIE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 School trustees have rejected a claim from a student who was strip-searched by 
school employees looking for a teacher's missing money. 
</P>
<P>
 The school board voted unanimously at its Feb. 1 meeting not to pay the claim 
by Jibril Andrews, one of the students on a Dec. 15, 1993, field trip to the 
Galleria at South Bay, said Assistant Supt.John Vinke. 
</P>
<P>
 The claim listed medical damages as "unknown" but asked for $250,000 for 
general damages, Vinke said. 
</P>
<P>
 The seventh-graders from Will Rogers Intermediate School visited the mall as 
part of a consumer math lesson. When a teacher complained that she was missing 
$400, a male teacher's aide searched the boys and a female aide searched the 
girls. 
</P>
<P>
 If a lawsuit is filed, the district will refer the matter to its insurance 
carrier, Vinke said. 
</P>
<P>
 John J. Hyland IV, the boy's attorney, said he hopes the matter can be settled 
without going to court. "For the children's sake that's probably not the best 
thing," Hyland said. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Monica Blodgett said three weeks ago that her office 
decided against filing criminal charges against the aides, saying that the 
aides exercised "extremely poor judgment" in conducting the search, but did not 
inflict mental suffering sufficient to warrant criminal charges. MARY GUTHRIE

COMMUNITY NEWS: HAWTHORNE: SCHOOL NEWS; $15-MILLION BOND ISSUE ON JUNE 7 BALLOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LISA RICHARDSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hawthorne elementary school trustees have decided to put a $15-million bond 
issue on the June 7 primary election ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 The district had proposed a $50-million bond issue, but a survey of 400 
residents showed it had little support.Voters were most likely to approve a 
bond that would raise their taxes by $25 a year, the survey found.  
</P>
<P>
 School officials say the $15-million bond issue, which must be approved by 
two-thirds of voters to pass, could add $20 a year to the average homeowner's 
property taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 The money would be used to replace portable classrooms with permanent 
structures, improve or install alarms and update electrical wiring. 
</P>
<P>
 The portable classrooms were installed over the past 10 years to accommodate 
the district's enrollment, which skyrocketed 36% during that span. The 
district, which has 7,300 students, is expected to have as many as 8,600 by the 
end of the decade. LISA RICHARDSON

 LIVIN' LARGE 
</P>
<P>
 At 5-foot-10 and 150 pounds, Jim Williamson is often the smallest player on 
the court in Loyola Marymount basketball games. But the freshman point guard 
from South Torrance High has been making his presence felt in a big way. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Williamson became a starter Jan. 15, Loyola is 3-4 after starting the 
season 1-11. The Lions beat Gonzaga and Portland last weekend at Gersten 
Pavilion to win back-to-back West Coast Conference games for the first time 
since the 1991-92 season. 
</P>
<P>
 Williamson's biggest thrill as a collegian came Friday when he made a running, 
four-foot hook shot with three seconds left to give Loyola an 82-80 upset over 
conference leader Gonzaga. It came after he had given the Lions an 80-79 lead 
on a three-point basket with 45 seconds left. He finished with 10 points and a 
game-high seven assists. 
</P>
<P>
 The next night, Williamson had 10 points and a game-high eight assists in a 
91-79 victory over Portland. Loyola (4-15, 3-5 in the WCC) plays at Portland 
(11-12, 4-4) tonight and Gonzaga (15-5, 7-1) on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite his lack of experience, Williamson has been doing a good job of 
distributing the ball -- all five starters scored in double figures Saturday 
against Portland -- and helping Loyola cut down on turnovers. He has 45 assists 
and only 17 turnovers in conference play. 
</P>
<P>
 And here's something for stat freaks to ponder. In games Williamson has 
started and scored in double figures, Loyola is 3-0. ATTRACTING A CROWD 
</P>
<P>
 The number of four-year colleges recruiting El Camino College forward Joe 
Zaletel continues to grow. 
</P>
<P>
 USC and Cal State Fullerton, two teams in need of a scorer, have already 
offered scholarships to Zaletel. Washington State has talked to him. And now 
Kansas appears interested in the 6-7 sophomore, who ranks second in the state 
with a 29-point scoring average. 
</P>
<P>
 Zaletel said he recently talked with a Kansas assistant after the Jayhawks 
requested a videotape of an El Camino game. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has taken me by surprise," Zaletel said. "I wasn't expecting any kind of 
recognition like this." 
</P>
<P>
 The play of the former Torrance High standout, who set an El Camino record 
with a 50-point game last month, has been the bright spot during an otherwise 
forgettable season. 
</P>
<P>
 The Warriors brought a 5-19 record, 1-5 in the South Coast Conference, into 
Wednesday's game at Mt. San Antonio College. Harbor routed El Camino, 120-85, 
Saturday despite a game-high 30 points by Zaletel, who has carried the load on 
a team weakened by injury, ineligibility and defection since last summer. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been really frustrating," Zaletel said. "Last summer we had one of the 
nicest teams I had ever played on. It's been a big turnaround." RECRUITING NEWS 
</P>
<P>
 The emerging Loyola Marymount women's volleyball team signed two prep seniors 
to letters of intent last week, but lost a recruit when Torrance High's Vika 
Malu changed her mind and signed with Pepperdine. Malu, a 6-1 middle blocker, 
had given Loyola an unwritten commitment last fall. 
</P>
<P>
 That left the Lions with a recruiting class of Tracy Holman, a 5-11 setter 
from West Torrance, and Sara Noriega, a 6-2 outside hitter from Ulysses High in 
Kansas. Holman also is a standout basketball player and had 27 points and seven 
steals Saturday in West's 51-42 victory over South Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
 Some think Noriega, an all-Kansas selection, could contend for a starting spot 
as a freshman despite the fact that Loyola returns its entire lineup from last 
season's 23-7 team that finished second in the WCC. 
</P>
<P>
 The addition of Holman gives Loyola five former South Bay prep standouts on 
its roster. The others are junior Robin Ortgiesen (Mira Costa) and freshmen 
Suzanne Radcliffe, Kim Blankenship (Torrance) and Tate Medley (Mira Costa). All 
but Medley were starters for Coach Steve Stratos last season. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Serra linebackers Milford Kinnard and Cary Martin will play college football 
in the Silver State. Kinnard, a South Bay all-star, signed with Nevada Las 
Vegas. Martin signed with Nevada, located in Reno. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Hawthorne defensive back Omarr Morgan, The Times' 1993 South Bay back of the 
year, signed with Utah. DOWN TO THE WIRE 
</P>
<P>
 With most of the boys' basketball races already decided, the Pioneer League 
has provided one of the few suspenseful finishes in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 First-place Centennial (7-2) controls its destiny, but Torrance (6-3) can gain 
a share of the title if it beats South Torrance and El Segundo upsets 
Centennial in league finales tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 Torrance stayed in contention by rallying for a 74-73 victory over host West 
Torrance on Tuesday. The Tartars erased a 69-66 deficit in the last 1:40 and 
hung on when West's Ryan Beatty missed one of three free throws after being 
fouled on a three-point shooting attempt with seven seconds left. Beatty led 
all scorers with 30 points. SUNKIST ENTRIES 
</P>
<P>
 Several of the area's top sprinters and hurdlers are expected to compete in 
the Sunkist Invitational track meet Feb. 19 at the Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 Tai-Ne Gibson and Felicia Williams of Morningside are entered in a strong 
girls' 50-meter field. The boys' 50 includes Kaaron Conwright of Westchester 
and Leguion Ulrich of Gardena. 
</P>
<P>
 Rori Kelly of Westchester and Nicole Thomas of Morningside will compete in the 
girls' 50 hurdles. 
</P>
<P>
 Serra running back Ricky Boyer is entered in the boys' 50 for football 
players. Boyer, a junior, is grouped in the same six-man heat with two USC 
recruits -- Bishop Amat running back Rodney Sermons and Muir defensive back Ken 
Haslip. RECORD-SETTERS 
</P>
<P>
 Chadwick's basketball team has set the Southern Section record for most 
three-point baskets in a season, eclipsing the previous mark of 234 set by 
Rolling Hills in the 1989-90 season. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dolphins made three three-point baskets, well under their average, Tuesday 
in a 50-44 Prep League victory over host Pasadena Poly to raise their season 
total to 262. They made 17 of 47 three-pointers Saturday in a 75-44 nonleague 
victory over Mary Star. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday's victory moved Chadwick (18-7, 6-1) into a first-place tie with 
Pasadena Poly in league play. Cameron Falck led the Dolphins with 16 points. 
ALOHA SERIES 
</P>
<P>
 The Loyola Marymount baseball team will play five games in four days in Hawaii 
starting Friday. The Lions play Hawaii in three games through Sunday, then face 
Hawaii-Hilo in a doubleheader Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Loyola (1-1) lost a nonconference game to Cal State Fullerton, 15-8, Tuesday 
after giving up 10 runs in the last three innings. The Lions led, 8-5, after 
five innings. Reliever Jesse Ibarra suffered the loss. ROB FERNAS

 Bus line -- A story about a new Downey bus line (Times, Feb. 3) included 
statements that were attributed incorrectly to Downey City Councilwoman Barbara 
J. Riley. The comments, which questioned ridership predictions for the bus line 
and suggested giving out taxi vouchers if the new buses prove too expensive, 
were made by Councilwoman Diane P. Boggs. Riley said she opposes the use of 
vouchers for taxis.

KID STUFF: MESS FOR SUCCESS; DON'T WORRY, NEATNESS DOESN'T COUNT IN THE RAUCOUS 
NICKELODEON LIVE TOUR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICK VANDERKNYFF, Rick VanderKnyff is a free-lance writer who contributes 
regularly to The Times Orange County Edition. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Onstage, the Nickelodeon Live Tour has the trappings and energy of a rock 
concert, complete with hockey-arena setting and screaming fans. But backstage, 
the glamour quotient isn't quite the same, says host Phil Moore. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's more like, 'I can't get this whipped cream off me. Look, I got slime on 
my shoes,' " Moore said with a laugh Sunday after a show in Minneapolis. "It's 
got that rock 'n' roll feel, with that Nickelodeon smell." 
</P>
<P>
 The Nickelodeon Live Tour, which comes to the Anaheim Arena on Saturday for 
two shows, is a touring compendium of the often-raucous children's shows that 
air on the cable network. That means participants, from the audience, are 
likely to get a cream pie in the face or doused in buckets of green slime. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, moms and dads, that means you, too. In fact, it may be your own precious 
little ones who do the sliming. Gleefully. "Dress to make a mess," Moore 
cautioned. 
</P>
<P>
 The event borrows some of the games of last year's Double Dare Tour, including 
William Tell. In that game, mothers aim toilet plunger "arrows" at targets that 
will dump slime on fathers' heads. In Musical Pies, a cream pie is passed 
around until the music stops, and, well, we'll let you guess the rest. 
</P>
<P>
 Featured prominently in the current 70-stop tour are games from Moore's own 
show, "Nick Arcade," in which participants are placed in video-game settings. 
Also featured are stunts from the show "Guts," including an obstacle course for 
kids, a basketball game in which players are suspended from elastic cords, and 
the Agro Crag, a climbing game complete with avalanches and snowstorms. 
</P>
<P>
 "Guts" host Mike O'Malley is Moore's co-host for the Live Tour. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents are invariably good sports about the proceedings, Moore said, adding 
that one of the tour's strong points is that it allows families to take part 
together. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is totally interactive. Kids maybe see a side of their parents they've 
never seen before, and parents see the enthusiasm of their kids." 
</P>
<P>
 The secret of the stunts and games, Moore said, is that they've taken things 
that kids do and blown them up larger than life. With the basketball game, for 
instance, "they're like Neil Armstrong on the moon. There's no way you can be a 
kid and not want to do that." 
</P>
<P>
 After the Anaheim date, the tour moves to the Los Angeles Sports Arena for a 
Sunday show. 
</P>
<P>
 What: Nickelodeon Live Tour. 
</P>
<P>
 When: Saturday, Feb. 12, at 1:30 and 4:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Where: Anaheim Arena, 2695 E. Katella Ave., Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 Whereabouts: From the Orange (57) Freeway, exit at Katella Avenue and go east. 
Turn left almost immediately into the arena parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
 Wherewithal: $12.50-$17.50.

REWIND: TANTALIZING AURA FUELS 'GASLIGHT' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Charles Boyer is probably best remembered as the quintessential Gallic 
heartthrob of the 1930s and '40s. 
</P>
<P>
 But Boyer may have turned in his most memorable performance when he played 
against his suave and romantic screen image in George Cukor's psychological 
mystery-drama, "Gaslight." In this 1944 film, the usually debonair Frenchman 
brings to chilling life the character of Gregory Anton, a manipulative and 
ruthless composer who tries to drive his naive wife, Paula (Ingrid Bergman, in 
an Oscar-winning performance), insane. 
</P>
<P>
 When this Victorian period film opens, an underage Paula is in the process of 
moving out of her home in an upscale area of London. It is revealed that her 
aunt and guardian -- a revered opera singer -- has been murdered and that the 
young girl is moving to Italy in an attempt to distance herself from that 
traumatic event and to further her own budding singing career. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten years later, Paula falls in love with Gregory. The couple quickly marry, 
and Gregory persuades his new bride to move back to the London estate that she 
inherited from her aunt. 
</P>
<P>
 But after the couple make the trek from Italy to England, Gregory's behavior 
suddenly turns cryptic and overbearing. He refuses to allow Paula to socialize 
and insists that she is becoming alarmingly forgetful and paranoid.

 A virtual prisoner in her own home, Paula's vivacious spirit begins to wither. 
</P>
<P>
 What keeps "Gaslight" burning is its tantalizing aura of mystery. The question 
is, why is Gregory trying to drive Paula out of her mind? The clues arrive in 
bits and pieces, and eventually it's evident that Gregory has a secret past 
connected to Paula and her aunt. 
</P>
<P>
 "Gaslight," based on a play by Patrick Hamilton, is also buttressed by three 
strong supporting performances. A fresh-faced Angela Lansbury is appealingly 
impudent as the housemaid;LAT

WANNA DANCE?: THERE'S PEER PLEASURE AT METROPOLIS

 Metropolis' newest gig, PleasureDome, may just be the sexiest young thing in 
the county. 
</P>
<P>
 From the pulsating grooves to many of the fashionable patrons, the Sunday-only 
event oozes with sex appeal. Beefy, Chippendales-like go-go dancers shake it on 
the go-go platforms, while screens show colorfully abstract videos of studly 
men, and another screen features a live shadow dancer. A state-of-the-art 
computerized light and sound system drenches the whole scene, which includes 
the distribution of free condoms, bearing the Metropolis logo, from 
CondomRevolution in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 Healthy attendance at last week's opening reflected an open-minded mix of 
sexes and sexual preferences, unified for the sole reason of getting in one 
more night of partying before the weekend is officially over. 
</P>
<P>
 DJ Eddie-X of Los Angeles' Temple-fame rotates an infectious run of house 
music that -- as the crowd showed -- was hard to resist. Dance fools who 
haven't visited Metropolis in months because they didn't like the obtrusive 
posts that split up the dance floor will love the recent changes: The posts are 
gone, consolidating the area into an open space.  
</P>
<P>
 The go-going Fettish Boys, clad in very little, elicit tips from onlookers of 
both sexes. On opening night, one Fettish Boy dressed in an original Van Buren 
sequined wind-breaker and mesh top studded with the letters F, A, G. 
In-your-face fashion is always the most fabulous. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the free condoms, you practitioners of social responsibility will 
appreciate that drinking beer here can actually help a local AIDS organization. 
Sunday marked the Metropolis debut of Pink Triangle, a micro-brewed light beer 
that, according to promotional cards on the club's tables, was "created for the 
nation's Lesbian and Gay Community." The Iowa-based brewery promises to donate 
no less than 25% of its profits to AIDS organizations in areas where the beer 
is sold.  
</P>
<P>
 Still, Pink Triangle didn't outdo the night's $2 drink specials of 16-ounce 
drafts of Bud, Coors Light and Miller Genuine Draft. After 9 p.m., the price of 
each rises to $3.25. Imported brews are $4 all night. Also at the bar: wells, 
$3.75; premiums, $4.25 to $5, and glasses of wine run $3.75 to 4.75. Bottled 
water and sodas are $2. 
</P>
<P>
 Metropolis's in-house sushi bar, Octopussy, serves it up from 7 to 11 p.m. 
Selections are $3 to $12. The kitchen also has available California cuisine, 
such as salads, pastas and sandwiches, $5 to $7. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the dance floor and main bar saw the greatest action on opening night 
(it took considerable patience to maneuver those areas or just to order a 
drink), the gorgeous rosewood pool tables were never wanting for players, even 
at $12 an hour. 
</P>

KIDS ON FILM: DAD TAKES ROMANCE OUT OF 'HERO' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNN SMITH, Lynn Smith is a staff writer for The Times' View section.

<TEXT>
<P>
 In "My Father, the Hero," a 14-year-old city girl goes on vacation with her 
divorced dad (Gerard Depardieu), and they both become entangled in deceit when 
she tries to impress a rich hunk by telling him her father is her sugar daddy 
and he plays along. (Rated PG)  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Can you say . . . "Oedipal"? How about . . . "incestuous"? 
</P>
<P>
 Well, then, try "gross."  
</P>
<P>
 For some pubescent girls, parts of this film might be a fun fantasy, I 
suppose. What girl today gets her dad all to herself for 10 minutes, much less 
10 days, not to mention on a white sand beach in the balmy Bahamas? And then 
finds the boy of her dreams, a guy who's handsome and rich and protective? And 
they fight over her? And she looks like a model and wears great clothes? 
</P>
<P>
 But still. When you base a sex comedy around a 14-year-old girl and her father 
lying about their relationship, there's bound to be a lot of psychological 
weirdness. And several kids questioned, as I did, the PG rating. They could 
just as easily have titled the film, "My Daughter, the Nymphet."  
</P>
<P>
 The girl, Nicole, has grown up on talk shows, she reads Cosmo, wears thong 
bathing suits and calls her mother "a bitch." Like most 14-year-olds, she 
considers her father only a notch above her mother, impossibly antiquated, and 
is embarrassed to share the planet with him. But at the same time, she yearns 
for his attention. 
</P>
<P>
 So she makes up this story, which causes the other guests to treat him like a 
child molester and provokes winks and nudges from the 17-year-old beach guys 
who figure she's easy. At 14.  
</P>
<P>
 The dad, from France, is the sort of guy who confides his own confused love 
life to people he doesn't know very well -- even if the person is 14 and his 
own daughter. At the same time, he is horrified at the prospect of his little 
baby growing up and dating.  
</P>
<P>
 When he finally accepts the inevitable, rather than keeping his distance, he 
joins her deception. 
</P>
<P>
 All the 12- to 14-year-old girls I talked to liked the movie, especially the 
romance with the boy, and thought the premise was funny. But they didn't seem 
to think he was much of a hero. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Jaylee Levine, 14, "It was a good movie, like the girl and the guy 
romance part. But not the child molest part. I didn't like that (the dad) went 
along with it. It was just, like, gross." 
</P>
<P>
 The movie's message could easily have been Shakespeare's: "Oh what a tangled 
web we weave/When first we practice to deceive." And maybe some got the point. 
</P>
<P>
 But the girls said they were too distracted by Depardieu (his Frenchness, his 
large, dimpled nose) and Dalton James who played cute guy Ben (his general 
hunkiness.)  
</P>
<P>
 Depardieu was the only good actor in the film, they thought. They called James 
an amateur, despite his good looks, and they unanimously thumbed down Nicole 
(Katherine Heigh) calling the character "a spoiled brat" and a "con artist." 
</P>
<P>
 Not many said they would want Dad's help in their own love lives. 
</P>
<P>
 "No. No. No," said Ashley Carlton, 14. "I would want him to stay out of my 
business."  
</P>
<P>
 "I wouldn't mind if my dad did that," Jennifer said. But she added: "A dad 
would never do that. . . . It's like one of those stories that would never 
happen in real life." 
</P>
<P>
 I'm glad. I got the disconcerting feeling that the filmmakers thought it was 
OK to portray a 14-year-old girl as a lust object. And that they thought the 
father really was a kind of hero. 
</P>
<P>
 They seemed to be going for the "Awww" ending when he says he wants to have 
more babies and hopes they're girls. But I'm sure there are others who would 
want to institute parenting licenses and then yank his.

PARKER'S PLACE: WELL, THERE'S ALWAYS NEXT SEASON -- MAYBE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The last day of the quail hunting season came and went at the end of the 
month, a passage duly noted by the handful of Orange Countians still interested 
in upland game hunting, and, of course, by their bird dogs. 
</P>
<P>
 My brother and I loaded up the truck, Cassius the one-eyed Labrador blundered 
into the back seat, and off we took for quail country, a two-hour drive from 
Laguna. The sky was a little cloudy at sunup, in apparent contradiction to the 
weatherman's prediction of strong Santa Ana winds all day. We were pleased by 
this, because the birds are extra hard to find on a windy day; dogs have a 
tough time smelling them, and if you are lucky enough to come across a covey 
they much prefer to run away -- invisibly scurrying through the brush -- rather 
than take to the perilous sky. 
</P>
<P>
 At the end of a season, be it skiing, football, autumn or holiday, the 
enthusiast feels an odd serenity creeping in, a sense of closure, and certainly 
loss. Time's big season-hand is just about to cross the 12 again. There you 
are, faced with one last opportunity to get it right, maybe to atone for all 
the mistakes you've made until now, braid the loose strings of a few month's 
time together in a rope that secures something of history, accomplishment, or 
at least enjoyment. 
</P>
<P>
 There's also that nagging reminder that you won't necessarily -- for reasons 
often quite outside your direct control -- be here by the beginning of next 
season to begin it all again. "It would be a shame for me to miss this," you 
think. You try not to get going too fast in this direction, lest true 
melancholy set in. It's poor form to get prematurely elegiac. 
</P>
<P>
 But, heading out toward the hunting grounds, I watched the familiar landmarks 
passing outside the windshield -- the fruit stand just south of Temecula, the 
big oak at the bend of Highway 79 a few miles past it, the pastures already 
emerald with new grass for the thoroughbreds, the cattle standing fatly by the 
roadside and viewing me back with profound disinterest -- and hoped more than a 
little to be making this same drive Oct. 15, when the season opens. I vowed to 
avoid personal tragedy until then, a resolution that, by the definition of 
tragedy, rarely works. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time we got to our first of three huntable areas -- secret spots 
revealed to me by a man who has known me longer than I've known myself (he and 
his wife baby-sat me as an infant) -- the wind was strong and our hopes for a 
good day were blowing away in it. The air was cold enough to sting your hands 
and face. We surveyed the land with the speculative air of economists, 
prognosticating where, logically, the birds might be. 
</P>
<P>
 But wild things tend to ignore logic in favor of survival, which is why they 
are still alive, so we simply set off up the hillside, bound for the gentle, 
cactus-heavy meadows where the birds will sometimes feed. These first few 
hundred yards, so rich with the possibility of finding birds, always go by as a 
kind of slow-motion, adrenalin-charged satori in which the potential of the 
hunt is as vast as the country around you, and as close as the cholla spines 
brushing past your ankles. 
</P>
<P>
 Anything can happen. 
</P>
<P>
 By this time we reached the top of the first ridge. Puffing hard, breaking 
sweat, birdless, it began to dawn on us that this in fact might turn out to be 
one very long day. We stopped. Cassius, hellbent as usual on getting a bird in 
his mouth, looked hopefully at me for guidance. Poor dog. It was a 
high-road/low-road decision. In the spirit of democracy we took a middle 
course, with Cassius weaving out ahead of us and pausing only occasionally to 
choke down huge mouthfuls of snow and look back at us with his one great 
beautiful eye. 
</P>
<P>
 We were fast marking the end of Cassius' fourth full season, a time during 
which he had retrieved enough birds to qualify, in the eyes of purists, as a 
"bird dog." He has made some fine improvements over these years, learning to 
work in closer, obey hand signals, use his nose instead of his legs to locate 
his quarry. A few weeks earlier, he had located a downed bird caught eight feet 
up in a manzanita tree (in a high wind, no less!), a feat of which I will be 
eternally proud and he has probably already forgotten. 
</P>
<P>
 But he has also developed a kind of schizophrenia, during bouts of which he 
will disappear for minutes at a time to flush birds from impossibly dense 
cover, ignore the whistle, disdain hand signals and generally make an obnoxious 
dolt of himself. I've noticed that these relapses often coincide with poor 
outdoorsmanship on my own part -- taking bad shots, not taking good ones, 
working a covey stupidly, watching the sky fill with escaping birds while 
urinating behind a bush. There is much room for improvement in both of us. 
</P>
<P>
 We hiked for two hours and didn't so much as hear a quail. The wind blasted us 
into near deafness, which may have had something to do with it. At this point, 
the mind inevitably begins to wander, an altogether pleasant experience. 
</P>
<P>
 I looked out to the distant mountains and nearer hills, noted encroachment of 
homes and trailers, and realized that by the end of the decade we probably 
won't be able to hunt this land any more. 
</P>
<P>
 So be it. 
</P>
<P>
 I thought about our County of Orange, so plagued of late by violence, 
catastrophe and confusion. Can consumerism evolve into citizenship? When?  
</P>
<P>
 At 40, you suddenly realize that many of the Earth's people are younger than 
you are, and how much better they are at doing what you like to do. I thought 
about watching the boys' tennis class on Monday nights at the high school, the 
easy grace, skill and joy they bring to the game. I thought about shooting a 
round of skeet recently with a young girl who scored a perfect 25, and smiled 
at me through her braces as she walked off the range and said, "I'm not new to 
this." I thought about this other girl I saw riding a horse a few days back, 
this plump cherub a study in natural harmony upon a 2,000-pound animal. It's 
immensely reassuring to know that lots of young people are already more 
accomplished than you'll ever be. It has nothing to do with hope, or with the 
future. They are reality; they are here. 
</P>
<P>
 We returned to the truck for food and water. The wind was stronger now, 
shivering the stout cactus and raising dirt devils on the road. We drove a few 
minutes to a new spot and commenced our march across the meadow. 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, the season was ending, right before our squinting eyes. For reasons 
not clear, I thought back to the night before when I'd sat in bed and listened 
to the wind chimes my sister gave me when my wife died, and remembered the note 
she'd given me with the chimes, something to the effect that "when you hear 
these moving in a breeze, know it's Cat come back for a visit," and sure 
enough, that night the chimes sounded and the patio door eased open, then shut 
again, as if someone had just come in, and though I do not believe in ghosts or 
in visitations by the dead, I will admit that a calm and a contentment came 
over me for a while after that and these were not feelings I had had in a long 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 At the end of a season, memories hit hard. 
</P>
<P>
 Rounding a dense stand of manzanita, I heard in the distance the telltale whir 
of bird wings, and saw two quail lifting fast from the scrub. They were out of 
range for a person of my skill. But I shot anyway, two times, what might be 
called "prayers," and prayers is just what they were, gestures directed toward 
the infinite. The birds swept up and away and safely over the rise. 
</P>
<P>
 Heading back to the truck a few minutes later I hoped that those birds would 
be here next year, and that I would, too. Given the grand scheme of things, 
neither is guaranteed nor crucial. 
</P>
<P>
 The only thing I was sure of is that the end of one season enables the 
beginning of the next.

COMEDY; LENDING HIS VOICE; STAND-UP VENTRILOQUIST DAN HORN INTERACTS WITH 
PUPPETS FOR LAUGHS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GLENN DOGGRELL, Glenn Doggrell writes about comedy for the The Times Orange 
County Edition. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Dan Horn has spawned an odd family. 
</P>
<P>
 Cassandra, his first-born, was conceived to be brash and obnoxious.  
</P>
<P>
 Orson, who is much older but came second (true story), was created to be 
grumpy and curmudgeonly. 
</P>
<P>
 Little Gary, a wooden-headed sort, is a self-parody of Horn. 
</P>
<P>
 Hardly the bunch Mr. Brady would assemble, but they all look up to Horn and 
turn to him for guidance. And in doing so, they have managed to earn a good 
living for the Arizona resident, who responds by stuffing them in trunks and 
hiring them out across the country, including a stop at the Brea Improv through 
Sunday.  
</P>
<P>
 "Cassandra was just a puppet I made to be the spunky, saucy, smart-aleck 
character," the stand-up ventriloquist said from his home in Chandler, near 
Phoenix, while trying to feed his infant son as his wife and daughter, 7, ran 
errands. "She was the Charlie McCarthy prototype, brash and obnoxious." 
</P>
<P>
 Orson's origins were more rooted in reality, and it didn't take him long to 
supplant Cassandra as the favored child. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had lots of aunts and uncles in our family, and I put Orson together to 
entertain family," continued Horn, who chose the name Orson because it wasn't a 
puppet-y name. "At the same time, I was doing open-mike nights with Cassandra, 
and someone suggested doing Orson, too. I said no, but I got bored after a few 
months with just Cassandra, so I did it to see." 
</P>
<P>
 The results were impressive. It seems everyone had a relative or a friend that 
was crusty on the outside, soft on the inside. 
</P>
<P>
 "There seemed to be a lot more that could be done with an elderly puppet," 
said Horn, 35. "I could find more material with a dirty old man." 
</P>
<P>
 Soon Orson was opening the show. More than 15 years later, Orson is still 
going strong.  
</P>
<P>
 "I think that's mainly because of the difference of the character," Horn said, 
referring to his interactive style and the soft-sculptured, cloth characters he 
uses as opposed to carved, wooden dummies. "Everyone had Charlie McCarthy for 
so long. Orson goes over well because people haven't seen him so much. I was 19 
when he was originated. He has a background. I react to him as if he were a 
real person." 
</P>
<P>
 Often on stage, when the puppet talks, the ventriloquist takes himself out of 
the show. He's more of a straight man. That's where Horn sets himself apart. He 
laughs at his puppets. He goads them.  
</P>
<P>
 "I have to react when Orson talks. That was something I consciously worked on, 
creating two personas." 
</P>
<P>
 That's where Little Gary fits in. He's the wooden dummy Orson uses to do 
traditional ventriloquism to parody Horn.  
</P>
<P>
 "Everything he does is the ventriloquism stereotype. Hopefully, what I do is 
get away from that." 
</P>
<P>
 A typical bit between Orson and Gary goes like this: 
</P>
<P>
 Orson: "What's your favorite class in school?" 
</P>
<P>
 Gary: "Wood shop." 
</P>
<P>
 Orson: "What are you building?" 
</P>
<P>
 Gary: "A date." 
</P>
<P>
 Horn's other characters include E.P. (short for extra puppet) and Polly Ester 
(a matronly type). And audience members should be forewarned: Horn's show 
includes an often-hilarious portion in which he brings a volunteer on stage and 
attaches oversized marionette sticks to his or her wrists to manipulate the 
arms as Horn provides the voice. Think of Mr. T's voice coming from a woman. 
</P>
<P>
 Horn started throwing his voice 30 years ago in Phoenix when he 5. Today, he's 
on the road about 36 weeks a year, performing at comedy clubs, casinos, 
colleges and conventions. 
</P>
<P>
 He has worked with Jay Leno, Howie Mandel and Rita Rudner. He has also 
entertained fans on Showtime, "Evening at the Improv" and "Comic Strip Live."  
</P>
<P>
 He's a hit with his peers, too. Last July, he was voted 1993-94 ventriloquist 
of the year at the annual International Ventriloquist Convention at Fort 
Mitchell, Ky. 
</P>
<P>
 But none of that guarantees Horn recognition. 
</P>
<P>
 At the convention, he was asked, "Can I get an autograph, Jeff?" A humbling 
request, given that Jeff is Jeff Dunham, Horn's competition. 
</P>
<P>
 "Actually, Jeff and I get along very well, and the more Jeff does, it's good 
for me. Because if people think I'm him, I get more exposure," Horn said, 
laughing. 
</P>
<P>
 And as a proud parent, he can afford to laugh these days. His act, sometimes 
racy but always entertaining, is in demand. His peers respect him. His kids 
respond to him. 
</P>
<P>
 But above all, they always say what he tells them to. 
</P>

the sea. For more than 30 years he has been an avid scuba diver, starting as a 
boy in the South Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a very personal relationship with the ocean and its creatures," said 
Hornsby, of Laguna Beach. "There's a tremendous depth of emotion it can bring 
forth -- deep comfort, belonging and rightness." 
</P>
<P>
 His poems of the deep have graced the pages of magazines and anthologies, 
while his recorded songs have been played in the bars of distant islands 
frequented by divers. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a kind of correctness in being in a place where your body and 
emotions feel welcome," he says of his time underwater. "It just feels like the 
right place to be." 
</P>
<P>
 Hornsby, 44, first discovered that place at age 12 when he moved to Guam with 
his family. 
</P>
<P>
 "I spent the next few years on the reef," he recalled. "I never could escape 
it. I'm one of those lucky people who, the first time he put a mask on and 
stuck his head underwater, had no question about what he wanted to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Simply put, Hornsby wanted to spend as much time diving as possible. So, a few 
years later, he became a diving instructor before moving to California and 
getting a job in a dive shop.  
</P>
<P>
 Today, Hornsby is vice president of legal, environmental and public affairs 
for the Santa Ana-based Professional Assn. of Diving Instructors -- one of the 
largest scuba-certification agencies in the world. He is also an accomplished 
underwater photographer who travels the globe in search of exotic sites. 
</P>
<P>
 Long a garage musician and dabbler in the literary arts, he wrote his first 
ode to the sea at age 15. Later, he published marine-oriented poetry in a local 
diving magazine and, in the late 1980s, had several poems included in an 
anthology called "Ocean Poets; Voices of the Deep."  
</P>
<P>
 A popular lecturer, Hornsby uses his poetry and photography in an underwater 
slide show he presents at six to eight international film festivals a year. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990 he recorded eight original, ocean-related songs in a cassette tape, 
"Dolphin's Dance," which, for a time, was available at dive shops, gift stores 
and ocean resorts around the world. 
</P>
<P>
 And once I find my way down under , 
</P>
<P>
 Feel the peace,  
</P>
<P>
 The sense of wonder, waiting,  
</P>
<P>
 I find the joy, baby,  
</P>
<P>
 It'll never end,  
</P>
<P>
 The sea's there waiting,  
</P>
<P>
 'Til I'm back again . 
</P>
<P>
 "I write from strong emotion," said Hornsby, who plays guitar and keyboard. 
</P>
<P>
 "As more and more of my life has turned around diving in the ocean, it was 
sort of natural that the emotion of my relationship with the sea became the 
starting point for a lot of my music." 
</P>
<P>
 There's also a strong ecological message, as evidenced by the title song. 
</P>
<P>
 We hear the dolphins singing , 
</P>
<P>
 The ocean's lullaby,  
</P>
<P>
 But the way the world is turning,  
</P>
<P>
 We're gonna make the dolphins cry . . .  
</P>
<P>
 " Divers tend to be extremely environmentally conscious," Hornsby said. "They 
are probably more attuned to the environment than most people; it really feels 
good to be able to help give something back to the ocean by sharing this 
feeling with others." 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, only a few places still play this environmentally correct tape, 
so you might have to travel a bit to hear it. Like to Yap, a Micronesian island 
between Gaum and Palau in the Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you sit in the bar there," Hornsby promised, "you'll have to listen to my 
tape all night long."

JUST PLAIN FOLK; DANCING SKILLS AND A SENSE OF COMMUNITY DEVELOP IN A CIRCLE 
(OR SQUARE OR LINE) OF FRIENDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN DUBIN, Zan Dubin covers the arts for The Times Orange County Edition.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Bill Evans' eyes glazed over every week for months. The folk dance lessons 
weren't so easy after all. 
</P>
<P>
 But now he has joined scores of other folk dancers across Orange County who 
have developed a zeal that often borders on fanaticism. 
</P>
<P>
 "I live five minutes away," Evans said recently at the Fullerton park where he 
dances, "and I chose that apartment because it was close to here." 
</P>
<P>
 Like fancy underwear, there's a different folk dance class in the county for 
each night of the week. But whether it's Scottish or Cajun, square or 
Scandinavian dance they prefer, local practitioners share an all-too-rare sense 
of community, a passion for good, sober fun and highly developed calf muscles. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's great exercise," said Chino psychotherapist Anne Swanson Brown, beads of 
sweat dotting her forehead during a recent Israeli dance lesson in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown's classmate David Friedman, a Mission Viejo attorney, said: "I come for 
the physical (benefits) but also for the mental. For three or four hours, I 
forget all my problems, and I'm in another world where it's only music and good 
times." 
</P>
<P>
 Times haven't always been good for many forms of folk dance, which lack the 
popularity they had during their counterculture heyday of 20 or 30 years ago, 
said Robert Altman, president of Orange County Folkdancers. 
</P>
<P>
 As the idea of "making your own fun" became increasingly foreign to Americans, 
Altman said, folk dance clubs moved off college campuses into the private 
sector. And that, Altman said, meant vastly fewer young people being recruited 
and an increase in dancers' average age. 
</P>
<P>
 The proliferation of aerobics, martial arts, VCRs and competition from such 
popular music and dance forms as country didn't help either, according to folk 
aficionados. 
</P>
<P>
 So beginning this Friday, to drum up renewed interest, the Laguna Folkdancers 
group will offer its first introduction to international folk dance class at 
its 24th annual festival, a three-day event. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the area's major folk celebrations, the festival typically attracts 
about 400 enthusiasts from throughout Southern California, who come for 
workshops with local and noted visiting teachers, performances by local troupes 
and dance parties. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, several county groups are holding steady or going stronger than 
ever: INTERNATIONAL FOLK DANCE 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Folkdancers, Laguna Folkdancers and Veselo Selo Folkdancers all 
practice international folk dance, which, despite the name, focuses on 
traditional cultures of Balkan and central European countries, parts of Russia 
and areas around the eastern Mediterranean Sea. 
</P>
<P>
 Dances may be easy, involving little more than walking and low kicks and hops, 
or intricate, brain-taxing endurance tests. There are solos, couple dances and 
group line dances, similar to country line dances except that participants hold 
each others' hands or grasp shoulders or belts. 
</P>
<P>
 Roughly 20 Laguna Folkdancers performed a Macedonian Lesnoto, clasping hands 
for the simple, lyrical line dance at a recent Sunday gathering. Wearing the 
soft, pointy-toed opanke sandal common among folk dancers, many hummed along to 
a soulful tune. 
</P>
<P>
 One participant candidly assessed the evening's crowd, made up of 30- and 
40-year-olds, as a bunch of fogies doing walking-around dances." 
</P>
<P>
 But, "a lot of young people are involved," countered Michelle Sandler, 37, a 
16-year folk dance veteran. "And if anyone wants to do more vigorous dances, 
they can request them." 
</P>
<P>
 Added Steve Himel, a Newport Beach computer programmer, "I like the variety 
that international folk dance offers." SQUARE DANCE 
</P>
<P>
 Considered one of America's own folk dances, square dancing is thriving here, 
due to such active organizations as Shirts 'N Skirts, turning 35 this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Its members hugging and chatting before a recent class, the group's palpable 
sense of community is emblematic of the local folk dance scene, where dancers 
take trips and celebrate birthdays, anniversaries and holidays en masse, and 
old-timers take pains to make newcomers feel welcome. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're working as a team with seven or eight people, so you depend on each 
other," said Dave Rensberger, a Shirts 'N Skirts dance caller. "And it's the 
whole spectrum of society; nobody cares what you do outside of square dancing." 
</P>
<P>
 Shirts 'N Skirts dances, held at Santa Ana's Ebell clubhouse, are a step back 
in time: The spitting image of the decals seen on many an RV, these beaming 
petticoated ladies and bolo-tied gents do-si-do and promenade to Rensberger's 
singsong calls: "Circle to the right left with a yak yak yak, dance up to the 
middle with a whoop and a holler." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, today's square dancing has evolved from its English and French roots 
into a more complex art with hundreds of movements and patterns. Lessons are 
mandatory. Shirts 'N Skirts' next 10-month session for beginners will start in 
January. 
</P>
<P>
 While dancers range from age 13 to eightysomething, the average Shirks 'N 
Skirts member is 40, and women tend to outnumber men. Cornering a visiting 
reporter, Cathy McLeod of Newport Beach worked to amend that. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tell all the guys in town," said McLeod, a vision in pink, "if they want to 
meet some really nice gals, and pretty ones too, they should come to the Ebell 
club. And tell them to bring a guy with them." 
</P>
<P>
 "The best thing about square dancing is that there's no drinking," offered Peg 
Bogard, a Huntington Beach businesswoman. "It's not a written rule, but if 
you're drinking, you're not thinking, which would screw up three other 
couples." SCOTTISH 
</P>
<P>
 Wanna-be folk dancers may be lured to this brand just by the names of its 
jigs: Sandy O'er the Lea, Misses Cramb of Linlithgow, Jessie's Hornpipe, 
Dashing White Sergeant, Sugar Candie, De'il Amang the Tailors. 
</P>
<P>
 The curious should have a taste for refinement too. Scottish dance, with its 
origin in the royal French court, demands precise lower-leg articulation, 
proper deportment and "has all the etiquette of polite society of a day gone 
by," said instructor Bob Patterson. 
</P>
<P>
 "You escort your partner off the floor," said Patterson, who teaches at the 
Edison Community Center in Huntington Beach. "You don't slump." 
</P>
<P>
 Even, however, while striving to keep toes pointed and heels elevated, 
students at a recent class seemed to be having no less fun than that De'il 
Amang the Tailors. 
</P>
<P>
 "The music is upbeat, and people have a good time," said Linda Boucher, a 
retired art teacher. "It's a real mental challenge because there are so many 
different combinations of steps, but you end up feeling like you've really 
accomplished something." ROUND DANCING 
</P>
<P>
 The lack of a major mental challenge is the allure of Round Dancing, named 
after dancers' circular progression around the room. 
</P>
<P>
 The "lazy-man's ballroom," its followers perform simplified versions of the 
waltz, tango, swing, fox trot, samba and other social dances, said Harmon 
Jorritsma, who teaches with his wife, Betty, in Orange and Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 "We dance for enjoyment and fun," Jorritsma said, "and we have our own rules, 
but they aren't very strict." 
</P>
<P>
 Additionally, a caller cues each new move so that men don't have to 
choreograph on their feet, a ballroom must. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's so great to be able to dance and not have to make anything up," said 
round dancer John Guerin, 63, as couples swirled slowly by during Jorritsma's 
recent Anaheim session. Most of the swirlers were were in their 70s and 80s; 
some have been at it for more than a quarter-century. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're celebrating a 60th wedding anniversary tonight," said Betty Jorritsma, 
whose class numbered about 100 recently. "I send birthday cards to everyone 
too." ISRAELI 
</P>
<P>
 Slapping the ground, skipping, whistling, whooping and raising their hands 
skyward to God, Israeli dancers at a recent Costa Mesa class hardly paused for 
breath between songs. 
</P>
<P>
 " Yassou! " one called out. " Opa! " called another. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the dances Yoni Carr teaches every Wednesday night are old classics. 
There's erev ba , a circle dance like the hora, and bat yiftch , a couples 
dance. 
</P>
<P>
 Some, on the other hand, are brand-new. 
</P>
<P>
 "We get the latest dances from Israel by fax," said Uri Hazan. "I'm not 
kidding!" 
</P>
<P>
 Swanson Brown, 36, drives 40 minutes each way to attend Carr's group. She 
prefers it over those that have more of a "night club" atmosphere, which has 
"broken up a lot of marriages," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They turn down the lights and have a lot more couple dances." 
</P>
<P>
 "We get people from San Diego, Pomona, wherever," Friedman said. "Sometimes we 
have up to 100." SCANDINAVIAN 
</P>
<P>
 Warning: Couple-dance phobics, don't apply. Scandinavian dancers don't whirl 
arm-in-arm around the floor. They whirl bear-hug around the floor. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not because Scandinavians are friendlier, more affectionate people," 
explained Donna Tripp, who teaches dances of Norway, Sweden, Denmark and 
Finland with Ted Martin in Anaheim for the 30-year-old Skandia Dance Club. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Swedish polska hold is used, Tripp said, because couples execute 
different steps, while, like the Earth around the sun, they're rotating as one 
unit and circling the room. If not exactly a bear hug, it's a much more 
intimate coupling position than typically seen. 
</P>
<P>
 "It gives a very firm position in regard to the partner and allows for closer 
contact and better centering of the dance," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tripps' students learn mostly traditional Scandinavian forms of waltz, 
schottische, polka and other couple dances that involve walking and turning, 
with lots of variations on that theme. 
</P>
<P>
 Amy Dale likes the challenge. "It looks deceptively simple," she said, "but 
it's not." 
</P>
<P>
 Like just about every folk group around the county, this one functions, even 
if not by design, as a singles group, with plenty of happy endings. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had probably 10 or 12 marriages grow out of this" group, said Tripp, 
who has spent most of her life in dance, whether ballet or folk, and likes to 
quote that like-minded comic strip canine. 
</P>
<P>
 "As Snoopy says, 'To live is to dance, and to dance is to live.' "
