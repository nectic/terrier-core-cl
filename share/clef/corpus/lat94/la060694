 D-DAY: Fifty years ago today, thousands of Navy Seabees swarmed the beaches of 
Normandy. . . . At H-Hour, demolition units blasted through the German 
obstacles on the beach so the first assault wave could land. Then construction 
battalions began building breakwaters and harbors. "They did all of this 
critical work at breakneck speed and all the while under enemy fire," said 
Vincent A. Transano, historian at Port Hueneme's Seabee base. Their role in 
World War II won high praise from Gen. Douglas MacArthur: "The only thing wrong 
with the Seabees is, there just aren't enough of them." 
</P>
<P>
 HONORABLE MOVE: Here's a switch. Instead of boosting perks as some politicians 
have done, Santa Paula Union High School board members have eliminated their 
own health benefits to help balance the school district's budget. . . . The 
board members must cut 10% from the budget, and forsaking health coverage saves 
as much as $15,000 a year, Supt. Robert Fisher said. "They feel that everyone 
needs to contribute to a balanced budget." 
</P>
<P>
 COWBOY WAY: The feds have trotted out what they consider a reasonable deal. 
But Ventura County cattle ranchers have branded it as something that could 
drive their herds off public lands. . . . Federal officials want to double 
cattle grazing fees in the Los Padres National Forest (B1). They also want 
ranchers to share the cost of protecting sensitive wildlife habitat from being 
trampled. But ranchers are suspicious. Said one rancher: "It's going to take a 
Philadelphia lawyer to figure this out." 
</P>
<P>
 SKY'S FALLING: Ventura residents who live on tree-lined Varsity Street are 
hopping mad over the mess raining down in their neighborhood. . . . Budget cuts 
this year prevented the city's trees from getting sprayed to prevent fruit from 
forming. So they pumped out a full load of dark-colored olives that stain the 
sidewalk and cars parked beneath them. At a meeting with 75 residents, Mayor 
Tom Buford got an earful about the threat from above. . . . The city's 
tree-spraying program has been reactivated.

MUSIC REVIEW; DIARY OF AN OJAI WEEKEND; THE MUSIC REMAINS THE FOCUS AT FESTIVAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN BERNHEIMER, TIMES MUSIC CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The sun blazed in the land of the Chumash. The birds sang, the gnarled 
sycamore clung to dignity in decay, and the audiences -- gratifyingly large and 
amazingly sophisticated -- cheered. 
</P>
<P>
 The sleepy little town that once, in a flight of inspired typecasting, 
portrayed Shangri-La for itinerant Hollywood isn't all that sleepy any more. Or 
all that little. 
</P>
<P>
 Ojai has been hosting an annual music festival for nearly 50 years. Your 
faithful scribe has been attending for nearly 30. The lovely locale seems to be 
weathering the passage of time better than the bleary-eared reporter. But the 
stimulation lingers on. 
</P>
<P>
 This year's long yet hardly lost weekend began with a Friday night concert 
that was stellar in at least two obvious senses. The festival ended early 
Sunday evening, five uncompromising, overstuffed programs later, with a 
symphonic tribute to a characteristic master who had worked here in 1955 and 
1956: Igor Stravinsky. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Tilson Thomas -- a proudly progressive product of Southern California 
(typically neglected in Los Angeles) -- returned for his seventh season since 
1968 on the podium in the modest bowl in verdant Libbey Park. Additional 
glamour was provided by an internationally celebrated guest who happens to have 
received some crucial training in Santa Barbara and Los Angeles: the baritone 
Thomas Hampson. 
</P>
<P>
 Tilson Thomas brought along his own orchestra from Miami, the youthful, 
exuberant and versatile New World Symphony, which employs very few players over 
the age of 30. He also brought an aesthetic conscience that respects the old 
but really probes the new -- new being anything influential to inquisitive 
musicians and relatively unfamiliar to inquisitive audiences. 
</P>
<P>
 Some things have changed in Ojai. The ever-dedicated Betty Izant doesn't run 
the box office out of a cigar box any more. For better or worse, the air of 
cheerful improvisation -- "Golly, Igor, let's get the kids out of the park and 
put on a concert!" -- has evaporated with the pink mountain mist. Amplification 
has become a common if nasty fact of life. 
</P>
<P>
 Joan Kemper, the tireless executive director, has turned the festival into a 
sleek professional operation. Ara Guzelimian now minds the late Lawrence 
Morton's store, and the young man isn't nearly as dour as his lamented 
predecessor. 
</P>
<P>
 Other things haven't changed. The wooden benches, which represent the good 
seats, still provide a hard trial for the assembled Sitzfleisch, though 
posterior challenges can be mitigated with the purchase of a $10 souvenir 
pillow. The spacious lawn at the rear still provides friendly accommodation for 
those who prefer to take their culture lying down. And, despite increasing 
urban distractions, the music remains the central focus. 
</P>
<P>
 Ojai, thank goodness, is still Ojai. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Friday at 8:15 p.m.: The festival begins with what turns out to be a recurring 
theme: yesterday's music filtered through today's sensibilities. In this case 
it is "Machault Mon Chou" (1988), a modest yet sweetly cheeky re-creation of 
some 14th-Century inspirations by Charles Wuorinen. Next comes an agreeably 
mild-mannered, gently dissonant Andante for String Orchestra (1931) by Ruth 
Crawford, the only female composer on the festival agenda and apparently an 
afterthought (she wasn't listed in any advance announcements). 
</P>
<P>
 The central attraction involves Mahler's haunting "Lieder eines fahrenden 
Gesellen," sung with exquisite poise, sensitivity and lyricism by Hampson -- in 
the best Fischer-Dieskau tradition. One may worry a bit about initial tempos 
that seem slower than slow, and about expressive indulgences that teeter on the 
brink of precious mannerism. But Hampson's poignancy triumphs over all risks, 
even if it cannot triumph over some noisy intrusions -- children screaming on 
the nearby playground and a band tootling on the patio of a nearby Mexican 
restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 Brahms' second Serenade, Opus 16, serves as a blissful benediction. Tilson 
Thomas conducts with stylish conviction and obvious sympathy throughout. His 
orchestra encounters some passing pitch problems and the brass tend to sound 
raucous in the warm night air. Somehow it doesn't matter. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday at 10 a.m.: The Southbeat Percussion Group of the New World Symphony 
presents a "Family Program," a.k.a. kiddie concert. It begins, rather 
ponderously, with an amateurish quasi-dramatized tale of a Scrooge who hates 
music. It ends with a clever audience-participation exercise in which the 
kiddies out front (kiddies of all ages, of course) get to make their own music, 
on cue, by shaking chow mein cartons containing a few pebbles. A good time is 
had by some. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday at 4:30: The concert begins with music by a distinguished Ojai 
alumnus, Lukas Foss. His "Phorian" (1967/1994) turns out to be a decreasingly 
amusing essay in scrambled Bach. The Kapellmeister of the Thomaskirche meets 
the Keystone Kops. A little irreverence goes a long way. 
</P>
<P>
 Leonard Bernstein's "Arias and Baracarolles" (1988) -- bittersweet on wry -- 
engage Hampson and mezzo-soprano Margaret Lattimore in a set of sometimes 
witty, sometimes sentimental songs. The singers make the most of their flimsy 
opportunities, sympathetically supported by Tilson Thomas. The unobtrusive 
orchestration by Bruce Coughlin, written after Bernstein's death, apparently 
supplants the more abrasive version by Bright Sheng. The annotations, here and 
elsewhere, are ridiculously inadequate, and a crucial page of text is missing 
from the program booklet. 
</P>
<P>
 After intermission comes Leon Kirchner's ardent and intricate Music for Flute 
and Orchestra (1978/1994). The otherworldly chirping of Paula Robison's 
virtuosic flute is nicely echoed by some worldly, equally virtuosic chirping by 
birds inhabiting the amphitheater trees. Talk about chance music. 
</P>
<P>
 The concert ends prettily, and not a hemidemisemiquaver too soon, with Luciano 
Berio's "Rendering" (1990), a brilliant realization of Schubert's sketches for 
his 10th Symphony gently fused with modernist "cement." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday at 9 p.m.: Musical indigestion beckons for at least one tiring 
listener as Tilson Thomas embarks on a seven-part mini-marathon of 
chamber-music self-consciously labeled "O Pioneers!" Although the individual 
components fascinate, the sum, in context, seems less than the parts. 
</P>
<P>
 The pioneers in question are John Cage, Adolph Weiss, Colin McPhee, Lou 
Harrison, Henry Cowell and Nicolas Slonimsky. Despite chronically misleading or 
incomplete program notes by Jim Svejda, one admires the funky vitality of 
Cage's "Credo in Us" (1942) and the circuitous suavity of Weiss' obscure 
Concerto for Bassoon and String Quartet (1949). One savors the repetitive nod 
to Asian formalism in McPhee's "Balinese Ceremonial" (wonderfully played by 
pianists Tilson Thomas and Ralph Grierson) and, more subtly, in Lou Harrison's 
Concerto for Flute and Percussion (1939). One is engaged by the quirky 
mock-folk impulses in Henry Cowell's String Quartet No. 4 (1936). 
</P>
<P>
 In each instance, one applauds the easy elegance of the soloists, all members 
of the New World Symphony. 
</P>
<P>
 "Studies in Black and White" (1929) by the beloved iconoclast Nicolas 
Slonimsky, now 100, reflect a dry and brittle wit engaged in brain games. 
Grierson plays the eight little pieces crisply. 
</P>
<P>
 It is fun. And it is enough. 
</P>
<P>
 The concert has gone on without intermission for an hour and 50 minutes. It is 
nearly 11. Cage's presumably climactic "Third Construction" (1941) still looms. 
The audience, however, has dwindled drastically. 
</P>
<P>
 Reluctantly but wearily, I join the dwindlers. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ojai diary will be completed in Tuesday's Calendar.

THEATER REVIEW; 'LUGHNASA' SAILS INTO THE MYSTIC; SCR DELIVERS A LUSH VISUAL 
SETTING, A COLORFUL ENSEMBLE AND POIGNANT FEELING FOR FRIEL'S LOVING PORTRAIT 
OF FIVE SISTERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Saving the Irish for last in a season notable for British, South African and 
Norwegian flavors, South Coast Repertory is offering the Los Angeles-area 
premiere of Brian Friel's "Dancing at Lughnasa" with as warm, earthy and 
evocative a production as you're likely to find. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that director Martin Benson's treatment has an indelible Irish tone right 
down to the marrow. It doesn't. But it has what is needed for Friel's loving 
portrait of five grown sisters whose family life in County Donegal is about to 
disintegrate: a lush visual setting, a colorful ensemble and poignant feeling. 
</P>
<P>
 Though tinged with sadness, the production is also remarkably good-humored. It 
tells an old-fashioned tale of heartbreak yet refuses to wear its heart on its 
sleeve or tug at easy emotions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dancing at Lughnasa" (pronounced LOO-nuh-suh) comes freighted with honors. 
First performed at Dublin's Abbey Theatre in 1990, it won the 1991 Laurence 
Olivier Award for best play when transferred to London, and the 1992 Tony Award 
when brought to New York. Since then, it has been mounted in dozens of regional 
productions by resident theaters across the country. 
</P>
<P>
 The time of the play is the summer of 1936, framed in memory by an omniscient 
narrator, Michael (Richard Doyle). He recalls key childhood events for us and 
occasionally slips into scenes not unlike the Stage Manager in "Our Town" or 
Tom Wingfield in "The Glass Menagerie," though commenting afterward with a 
sense of awe rather than irony. 
</P>
<P>
 But mostly he disappears and lets the play focus on his unmarried mother, 
Chris (Elizabeth Dennehy), and her four older sisters, all headed toward 
spinsterhood with varying degrees of resignation or reluctance: the puritanical 
Kate (Megan Cole), the sardonic Maggie (Kandis Chappell), the mousy Agnes 
(Deborah Van Valkenburgh) and the simple-minded Rose (Ellen Lancaster). 
</P>
<P>
 Although just scraping by, they've managed to get a radio. It's a 
temperamental instrument that goes on the blink more often than not. But when 
it works, it "throbs with the beat of Irish dance music" as well as the Tin Pan 
Alley sounds of Cole Porter, sending waves of rare pleasure through the house. 
</P>
<P>
 The summer is also marked by a pair of unexpected visits from Michael's 
father, Gerry (James Lancaster), a dapper Welsh salesman with dancing feet whom 
he has never seen, and the return of an uncle, Father Jack (Hal Landon Jr.), a 
missionary priest sent home from Africa after serving 25 years in a leper 
colony because he had "gone native." 
</P>
<P>
 We hear, too, of the harvest dances and bonfires in the surrounding Donegal 
hills, a throwback of sorts to ancient pagan rites known as the Festival of 
Lughnasa honoring Lugh, the Celtic god of the harvest (hence the play's title). 
</P>
<P>
 But these are only the outer trappings of a elegiac memory piece concerned 
less with plot than poetic texture, less with transformations of character than 
nuances of mood. As Michael says, his recollection of that summer seems a 
mirage in which "atmosphere is more real than incident and everything is 
simultaneously actual and illusory."  
</P>
<P>
 The production design echoes that sentiment. Fleecy white clouds dominate 
Ralph Funicello's set. They are painted in a blue sky above a backdrop of 
tilled fields. The platformed house has no walls and sits like a wooden ship 
floating at anchor on a raked stage within the trompe l'oeil countryside. 
</P>
<P>
 Everything is bathed in the rich ambience of Paulie Jenkins' lighting. His 
hues sometimes take on the glow of pink and gold. By contrast, Walker Hicklin's 
purposely drab peasant costumes convey the lackluster reality of the sisters' 
lives. The total effect is gorgeous, a surreal blend of the natural and 
artificial. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the acting, it is all very solid. 
</P>
<P>
 Chappell seemed to enjoy herself the most on opening night Friday. But Ellen 
Lancaster walked off with the show. She gives a vivid, detailed, touching 
performance as Rose, the only character in the play who is visibly transformed 
by her experience.  
</P>
<P>
 Among many haunting moments, several are transcendent. 
</P>
<P>
 One comes when the sisters, listening to the radio, burst into a primitive 
group dance. Even Kate is swept up in the foot-stomping fervor. Another comes 
when Father Jack, who feels lost and forlorn, taps out a rhythm on a pair of 
sticks and does a shuffling step recalled from some African tribal ritual. 
</P>
<P>
 Both scenes, as well as others linked by the instinctive language of dance, go 
deeper than words. And South Coast's production as a whole brings us closer to 
that mystical communion. 
</P>

POP MUSIC REVIEW; CAJUN-ZYDECO FESTIVAL HAPPY BEING HUMBLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY LEWIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was pure serendipity, but the eighth annual Southern California Cajun & 
Zydeco Festival provided a nonetheless ideal counterpoint to a week of 
ultra-expensive superstar concerts. 
</P>
<P>
 On the opposite end of the musical scale from the Barbra Streisand and Eagles 
extravaganzas, the Cajun-zydeco fest was a timely celebration of humble music 
created simply to express an emotion or to inspire dancers to move their feet. 
</P>
<P>
 Accordionist and singer Walter Mouton made his West Coast debut at Saturday's 
opening of the two-day fest. He is a revered figure in Cajun music who 
explained an essential difference when introducing the four members of his 
Scott Playboys band: 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not professional musicians," he said. "We don't make a living at music 
-- everybody up here has jobs they work five days a week." 
</P>
<P>
 Consequently, like most true folk musicians, Cajuns and Creoles by and large 
play first out of enjoyment. That was evident in nearly all the performances at 
the Rainbow Lagoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Take the hourlong midafternoon set by Mouton, the only performer on the 
five-act bill who hadn't appeared at this event previously: Wearing a baseball 
cap, T-shirt and blue jeans, Mouton looked more like the truck driver he is 
five days a week than a festival-caliber musician. 
</P>
<P>
 But his band played exuberantly, minus the production flash and celebrity 
personality that enticed thousands of Southlanders to fork over hundreds of 
dollars a ticket to see the Eagles reunite or Streisand say farewell to concert 
touring. 
</P>
<P>
 The Scott Playboys also brought the most authentic taste of the Cajun-country 
brand of playing that local audiences have had a chance to see. Where 
traditional Cajun music is played with fiddle, the single-row button accordion 
and perhaps a guitar, Mouton's band epitomizes the cross-fertilization of Cajun 
with country music that occurred in the early part of this century. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with those core instruments, the Scott Playboys use steel guitar, 
electric bass and drums. Steel guitarist Randall Foreman pepper-plucked his 
instrument in perfect complement to the choppy "chank-a-chank" accordion and 
fiddle technique that characterizes Cajun music. 
</P>
<P>
 You get the feeling that if a planeload of tubas went down over Louisiana's 
Cajun country, it wouldn't be long before some enterprising players would find 
a way to make those instruments fit right in too. 
</P>
<P>
 Singer, guitarist and composer D.L. Menard and his two-man Louisiana Aces 
represented the halfway point between Mouton's Cajun-country hybrid and the 
straight traditional style that brothers Danny and Edward Poullard used to open 
the show. 
</P>
<P>
 Menard almost bubbled with joy during his stint on stage. Perhaps it was the 
recent news that he had been awarded a National Heritage Foundation $5,000 
"master artist" grant that helped put him in such a spirited mood. 
</P>
<P>
 After singing "The Green Oak Tree," one among many of his songs that have 
become contemporary Cajun standards, Menard acknowledged the crowd's applause 
with a boisterous, "Hey! Thank you!!" 
</P>
<P>
 With it, he flashed a startled grin, like that of a man realizing he's just 
set his own chair factory on fire -- which, in fact, is exactly what Menard did 
last fall trying to rid the factory of a hornet's nest. (Backstage later, 
Menard said the chair factory, which is his main means of financial support, is 
well on its way to being rebuilt.) 
</P>
<P>
 Though he doesn't always include an English-language song in his performances, 
on Saturday Menard showed festival-goers why he's long been called "the Cajun 
Hank Williams" with his soul-deep wail in an eerily Hank-like reading of 
Williams' "Your Cheatin' Heart." 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Riley, one of the young standard-bearers of traditional Cajun music, 
seems intent now on becoming a Jack-of-all-trades. He included several zydeco 
tunes on which he exchanged his single-row Cajun button accordion for the 
two-row button instrument favored in the upbeat, rock- and R&B-infused variant 
of Cajun music. 
</P>
<P>
 Nathan & the Zydeco Cha-Chas concluded the day with a set that got most 
onlookers dancing, but which fell short of the musical virtues found in his 
predecessors' sets. 
</P>
<P>
 Nathan Williams is a far more animated performer than he once was, but he 
still hasn't developed the mastery of the accordion required to keep 
riff-driven blues-based zydeco songs interesting during extended jams. 
</P>
<P>
 The highlight, ironically, was an instrumental waltz he played alone, minus 
the rubboard-sax-guitar-bass-drums accompaniment he often struggled to keep up 
with elsewhere in his set. 
</P>
<P>
 Late in the day, festival organizer Franklin Zawacki estimated Saturday's 
attendance at under 2,000, saying: "I don't think we've hit the break-even 
point yet." 
</P>
<P>
 But he quickly added a postscript that would have been unthinkable coming from 
a Streisand or Eagles concert promoter had they been gazing at a 
less-than-capacity turnout: "I'm still really happy."

POP MUSIC REVIEW; TRAMPS SHY AWAY FROM DEEPER SIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE BOEHM, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As usual, Cadillac Tramps made it an exciting and pounding ride. 
</P>
<P>
 Playing its most prestigious headlining gig to date Friday night at the 
Palace, the hard-driving Orange County band took a large and loyal following on 
a typically sweat-soaked excursion. 
</P>
<P>
 But if the Tramps want to be an all-terrain vehicle that can take fans around 
the emotional bends as well as zoom down the high-energy speedway, they are 
going to have to load their concerts with all the options. At the Palace, we 
didn't get some of the most powerful add-ons in the Tramps' recently improved 
and updated product line. 
</P>
<P>
 The band can hardly be accused of spinning its creative wheels (sorry about 
all these automotive metaphors, but I'm a product of American car culture -- I 
can't help myself). With their new album, "It's Allright," the Tramps make 
significant strides. In two previous releases, they usually emphasized the 
humorous side of life on the mean streets, chuckling in the face of desperate 
circumstance with a seriocomic, deliberately cartoonish swagger. With "It's 
Allright," their best and most complex album, the Tramps take a deeper, more 
serious look at people struggling to hold their frayed lives together in the 
face of social decay and their own inner turmoil. 
</P>
<P>
 If the band wants to operate at the highest possible level, its challenge is 
to bring all the strands together -- the ribald humor with the full-on anguish, 
the sweaty stomps with the dark, coiled songs in which the thrill comes from 
the power of the emotions, and not just the physical clout of the performance. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the course of their three albums, Cadillac Tramps have created a kind of 
composite character. He's a complex fellow who laughs and clowns and tries to 
tough it out with wry bravado, but who lets down the mask sometimes to reveal 
how overwhelmed and desperate he feels. If the Tramps can deliver a show that 
explores the full range of that guy's feelings in a cohesive way, they will be 
reaching their potential. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Palace, there were some small but positive steps in that direction, but 
the Tramps' 70-minute set was mainly business as usual, relying on the 
qualities that for the past five years have made it the most popular band on 
Orange County's grass-roots alternative rock scene. 
</P>
<P>
 Front man Mike (Gabby) Gaborno's natural inclination on stage is to go with 
the swaggering, fun part of the Cadillac Tramps composite. The massively round 
and bouncing Gabby really is a homeboy -- an entertainer with a rare gift for 
establishing a bond of fellowship with his audience, even as he joshingly 
ridicules them (while including himself in the joke). When he stretched out his 
arms and greeted the crowd as "all my friends," or repeatedly addressed them as 
"brothers and sisters," it wasn't a show-bizzy ooze of snake oil he was 
selling, but a warm, genuine cup of fond regard. By the end of the show, Gabby 
had given away his blue bandanna, his sunglasses and his wrist band as tokens 
of appreciation to fans near the stage. 
</P>
<P>
 He was antic, as always, playing the part of the ribald carouser and show-off 
-- a shuffling, Spanglish-spouting hi-de-ho man, a Sir Juan Falstaff whose 
ample belly, protruding from an unbuttoned shirt, is his proudest trophy. Gabby 
has gone overboard at times in the past in his pursuit of belly laughs via 
flab-shaking, stomach grabbing, trouser-lowering sight gags. This time, he kept 
such displays within reason. 
</P>
<P>
 The other Tramps don't slack on visual presentation. Lead guitarist Jonny 
Wickersham combined the dark-suited garb of a '50s jazzman with the spiky, 
electric-blue hair of a '70s punk rocker. The other guitarist, Brian Coakley, 
wheeled jerkily about the stage like a marionette in the hands of a clumsy, 
novice puppeteer. Warren Renfrow, a bassist with the approximate dimensions of 
a large refrigerator, looked like Curly of the Three Stooges with his shaven 
head, except with a touch of menace. 
</P>
<P>
 Musically, the Tramps were up to par, which means that the 16 strings 
collectively commanded by Wickersham, Coakley and Renfrow hit with the impact 
of 16 tons. The Tramps' sound is a sort of Yardbirds update in which punk drive 
is harnessed to old-line blues and rock 'n' roll licks, with Wickersham's 
razory solos giving the band's blunt force a cutting edge. Strong backing 
vocals from the two guitarists gave choruses a lift behind Gaborno's growly 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tramps' new drummer, Dieter Hartman, capably sustained the beat through 
the thrusting, bouncing and churning grooves on which Tramps songs are built. 
The transplanted Austrian didn't sound as muscular as predecessors Jamie 
Reidling and Spanky Barrios, but that may have been a matter of a sound mix 
that favored vocals and lead guitars over the rhythm section (and a good mix it 
was: too many rock shows are undermined when lyrics and guitar parts are 
expunged by booming basses and crashing cymbals). 
</P>
<P>
 The show rocked, most certainly. But it didn't tug at the heart and mind as it 
might have. Along with such rowdy favorites as "Life on the Edge" and "Train to 
Fame," from their 1991 debut album, and "Shake!" an aptly titled track from the 
1992 release "Tombstone Radio," the Tramps did include several of their new 
album's dark songs. But "It's Allright," the title track that was being shot 
for a video, came off as just another hard-charging burner. The song is about 
loyalty and comradeship under the hardest circumstances, as its protagonist 
promises to stand by an AIDS-stricken friend in her fight with "monsters no one 
can see." But that emotional subtext didn't come through. 
</P>
<P>
 Gaborno did set aside his customary antics to sing with straightforward 
intensity on new songs like "Hate," a rousing anthem that decries the rise of 
meanness and suspicion on the social landscape, and "All I Wanted," a portrait 
of a desperate character who sees all avenues to a good life closed. 
</P>
<P>
 But to complete the character composite that emerges on their albums, Cadillac 
Tramps need to play their most probing songs. Those tend to be slower ones that 
would force them to downshift and conceive their shows as something more than a 
continuous action sequence. 
</P>
<P>
 These are some of the cards the Tramps didn't play: "(Carry My Soul To) The 
River," a deep lament from "Tombstone Radio," and such new-album highlights as 
"Wreckage," a vivid, richly melodic song that explores anguished depths, and 
"Waiting," a taut suicide note in which the band shifts to a reggae-beat 
arrangement a la Elvis Costello's "Watching the Detectives." One can understand 
the Tramps' desire to give faithful fans the rocking fun they've come to expect 
from the band. But they can't let that stop them from playing their most 
strongly emotional material, and showing off their full range as a band. To do 
otherwise would be a failure of nerve. 
</P>
<P>
 In a telling moment, Gaborno took an encore request for "Don't Go," a sad, 
romantic power ballad from the Tramps' first album. He hemmed and hawed while 
Coakley strummed the opening chords, as if reluctant to plunge into the set's 
only ballad. In a touching gesture, he noticed a woman crying in the audience 
during the song, and tried to cheer her up with the happy-face gestures that 
older kids make when a little one has gotten upset. 
</P>
<P>
 "Somebody give her a big hug and tell her things aren't as bad as they 
(seem)," Gabby said when the song was over. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tramps won't realize their potential in concert until they play the songs 
that make it powerfully clear how bad things can be. They have to find a place 
for the tears, along with the laughter and the sweat.

 Rubble-Rousing: "The Flintstones" grossed an estimated $18 million in ticket 
sales during the weekend, down from the three-day Memorial Day weekend's 
record-setting $37.2 million, but still enough for the Universal release to 
shake box-office bedrock. Since its premiere on May 27, the film has taken in 
$62.2 million. The runner-up in attracting filmgoers was Warner Bros.' 
"Maverick," the Western starring Mel Gibson, which took in $10 million. In 
third place, Paramount's "Beverly Hills Cop III" starring Eddie Murphy garnered 
$6.9 million. "Renaissance Man," the newcomer from Touchstone Pictures directed 
by Penny Marshall, opened with $5.3 million for the No. 4 spot. In fifth was 
Universal's "The Cowboy Way" starring Woody Harrelson with $5 million for its 
opening weekend.

 Eagles Land in San Diego: Though the Eagles stepped up from an amphitheater to 
a larger stadium setting for the first time in the group's reunion tour, the 
quintet played virtually the same songs Saturday night before an estimated 
46,000 at San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium as in the tour opener last month in 
Irvine. The emphasis remained as much on post-Eagles songs as on formal Eagles 
songs. The tour is expected to return to Southern California on Oct. 8, 
probably at the Rose Bowl.

 A Fan for Barbra: One of Barbra Streisand's adoring fans at the singer's 
Saturday night concert at the Pond of Anaheim became a part of the show. After 
Streisand explained that the outfit she was wearing was inspired by what she 
wore at an inauguration gala -- a suit with a long slit skirt that was 
criticized by a woman in a newspaper column for sending mixed messages about 
women, a voice piped up from the audience, "For one woman to attack another for 
being both accomplished and attractive is a shanda (shame) to the neighbors." 
The voice belonged to super-Streisand fan Linda Richman, the Long Island 
character played by Mike Myers of "Saturday Night Live," throwing in her 
trademark Yiddish. Richman then joined Streisand onstage as she did at the 
singer's New Year's concert in Las Vegas and said Streisand's legs looked "like 
buttah." Richman also complimented Streisand for being on the cover of the new 
magazine about home design, "InStyle": "They should make you secretary of the 
interiors." TELEVISION

 Overtime for Underwriters? In an effort to give corporate sponsors more bang 
for their public broadcasting bucks, the Public Broadcasting Service is 
considering proposals to increase the time allotted in programs for 
acknowledging underwriters. Current rules allow only 30 seconds for underwriter 
credits at the end of a broadcast, with a maximum of 15 seconds to a single 
underwriter. One proposal would allow as many 15-second credits as necessary 
for sponsors who contribute 20% or more to the funding of a broadcast. 
Corporate spokesmen, now banned, may also be considered as well as ads the 
underwriters use on commercial TV. Decisions on the proposals are not expected 
until the fall.

 Ban on Crime News: Some South Florida hotels are pulling the plug on the Fox 
station in Miami, saying its heavy diet of crime stories is scaring guests. 
WSVN-TV helped popularize a tabloid news format that relies on sensational 
headlines, slow-motion footage and such features as "Crime Check" and "Most 
Wanted." Victor Farkas, who has shut off WSVN at his Thunderbird and Chateau by 
the Sea hotels, said local residents and tourists "look at Channel 7 and 
they're afraid to go out on the street." Fox dismissed the criticism. "We're 
not going to censor the news to placate the hoteliers," said WSVN's Charlie 
Folds.

 Sweeney's Unambiguous Stand: Julia Sweeney, known for her sexually ambiguous 
character Pat on NBC's "Saturday Night Live," is scheduled to film a public 
service ad for the group People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals today in 
Los Angeles criticizing the Boston-based Gillette company for animal testing. 
"I'll never shave again until Gillette stops testing on animals," Sweeney, as 
the Pat persona, will say on the ad, adding: "What part of his/her body will 
never be shaved again remains unknown." Gillette issued a statement in response 
to the ad emphasizing the company's commitment to "reduce significantly the 
number of laboratory animals required for product safety tests, to further 
refine test methods and to adopt laboratory animal test alternatives. . . ." In 
other Sweeney news, reports that the comic will not return to "Saturday Night 
Live" this fall have been confirmed by her publicist. BETH KLEID

CLASSICAL MUSIC TAPPED OUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Face it: Classical music is a dead language. In the latest skirmish of the 
Thirty Ears War, music-lover Claire Rydell writes that composers "Milk a 
Dead-End Aesthetic" (Counterpunch, May 2), composer Burt Goldstein retorts with 
ad hominem tut-tutting ("New Music Merits Respect, Not Attack," May 16), Times 
Music and Dance Critic Martin Bernheimer scolds the troops for defecting 
("Modern Progress Under Salonen's Green Umbrella," May 18), and UCLA Professor 
Paul Reale preaches that history will go on ("In Support of Well-Conceived 
Music -- Old and New," May 23). 
</P>
<P>
 But the war is already lost. Classical music is a dead language -- not so dead 
that no one speaks it, but dead enough so that you can't write classical music 
anymore without it sounding like an imitation of a dead composer. 
</P>
<P>
 Composers hate when that happens. Yet there are only so many beautiful things 
you can do with rhythm and tonality (or its derivatives), and they've already 
been done. So if today's composers were to write attractive tunes and 
harmonies, you'd know who they sound like. But by writing ugly music, you can't 
tell. Which means, of course, that none of them sounds like much of anything. 
And you don't much care. 
</P>
<P>
 Think of classical music as the Latin of musical languages. Then you can see 
why intellectuals like Pierre Boulez write in dead Mesopotamian dialects -- or 
deadly mathematical monolects -- while minimalists like Philip Glass write Hare 
Krishna mantras. It's so you won't confuse one with the other. Or with Chopin. 
</P>
<P>
 We listen to Beethoven, Brahms and Tchaikovsky because we respond emotionally 
to great symbolic expressions of heroism, of anguish, of excitement, tenderness 
and joy; just as we respond viscerally to great displays of bravura technique 
and to beautiful sounds. No other music has such power to move us. 
</P>
<P>
 Music and the arts have the power to fulfill and inspire us. But they also 
have limits, beyond which they lose their power. And this very potential is a 
non-renewable resource that great artists and composers have used up. Yet, even 
if it's no longer possible to carry the development of the arts much further, 
we can still enjoy the riches of our artistic heritage -- without having to 
apologize for what we do not like.

'BAD GIRLS' ARE GOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Re that Counterpunch on the movie "Bad Girls" (" 'Bad Girls' Fires Off Bad 
Message," May 23): Was the violence portrayed in the movie extreme? Hardly, 
when you compare this flick to that testosterone-packed film, "No Escape," or 
to the previews of Brandon Lee's last film, "The Crow." 
</P>
<P>
 It's not that I like violence in film; I don't. It's just that when you've 
spent your entire life watching women portrayed as prostitutes, victims and the 
hero's lesser half, it's refreshing to see film heroines who are capable of 
taking care of themselves.

MONEY, TALENT AND FILM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It would seem from Charleton Heston's Counterpunch ("All Artists Can't Have 
Creative Control," May 16) that the esteemed actor, producer, director and 
former president of the Screen Actors Guild is a company man. His thesis can be 
reduced to the principle that the person or entity that finances a film enjoys 
the right to creative control. 
</P>
<P>
 But creative power in Hollywood lies essentially in a vacuum. It is there to 
be seized by the person or element whose creative vision is the most dynamic. 
The process is a power struggle in the better sense of the phrase, with, 
ideally, the most cogent and creative force ultimately succeeding. 
</P>
<P>
 And it is often the synthesis of these two forces that produces the product. 
If one of these two forces must prevail, however, aren't we all better off when 
it's talent?

COUNTERPUNCH: POST-DISASTER L.A. WELCOMES MUSIC, NOT DOCUDRAMAS; A CALL TO ARMS 
FOR THE ARTS -- FISCALLY SPEAKING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERNEST FLEISCHMANN, Ernest Fleischmann is executive vice president and 
managing director of the Los Angeles Philharmonic Assn. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For many years now I have tried to make the case for public funding for the 
arts. When we finally elected a musician, a skilled saxophonist, to the White 
House I really thought we who work in the arts had found a possible ally. And 
when President Clinton was heard to say that he believes the arts should be 
part of the everyday life of all Americans, I became positively optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, unfortunately this optimism does not seem to have been justified. The 
federal government still stumbles along, financially tightfisted in terms of 
the arts. At the state, county and city levels, severe budget constraints are 
hurting the arts at least as much as most other aspects of our lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Here in Los Angeles, we have suffered more than our share of natural and 
social disaster, yet together many of us have managed to keep cool and focused, 
while we do all we can to help our neighbors recover from a series of disasters 
of biblical proportions. The artists and particularly musicians of our 
community, including the Los Angeles Philharmonic, have provided much-needed 
solace to a great many citizens in this eventful time.  
</P>
<P>
 Except for a chamber music concert on the night of the earthquake, the 
Philharmonic was able to carry on performances uninterruptedly the week of Jan. 
17. Although many musicians and staff members were grappling with damaged homes 
and displaced family and friends, we pressed on. We immediately arranged for 
free shuttle bus service from the San Fernando Valley and Westside to our 
concerts downtown. 
</P>
<P>
 On Feb. 18, the Philharmonic performed a free "Concert for Recovery" at the 
Music Center, featuring conductor John Williams and flute soloist Gregory 
Lawrence Jefferson. We invited disaster relief personnel, school groups and 
hundreds of Angelenos to lay down their shovels for one evening and pursue 
rebuilding of another kind, the spiritual rejuvenation that beautiful, powerful 
music can bring.  
</P>
<P>
 At a time when psychological and physical anguish caused some people to 
consider packing their bags and leaving our city, the Philharmonic gave many 
residents a strong reason to stay. Rheta Goldman, coordinator of the North 
Hollywood Adult Learning Center, wrote me a letter of thanks dated Feb. 22. Her 
students, ranging in age from 18 to 80, are recent immigrants who live in the 
San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many have also experienced earthquakes in their native countries -- Armenia, 
Japan, Mexico, Central and South America. The recovery concert really lifted 
their spirits and made them feel how grand a country America truly is," Ms. 
Goldman wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Philharmonic concert touched so many who were feeling so very vulnerable 
(including myself). It gave us an evening of pure joy -- upbeat and 
encouraging." 
</P>
<P>
 Public funding supports the Philharmonic's free Neighborhood Concerts in urban 
venues and other underserved areas, as well as concerts in public schools 
throughout L.A. County, and ensemble visits to classrooms, hospitals, 
children's homes and shelters. These programs are vital to ensuring that music 
of the highest quality is experienced by the widest possible audiences. Public 
funding allows the Philharmonic to offer tickets to summer concerts at the 
Hollywood Bowl for as little as $1. 
</P>
<P>
 The Philharmonic, in a variety of ways, strives to be seen as an indispensable 
community resource. Our musicians serve as cultural ambassadors, presenting a 
positive image of Los Angeles around the world through international tours and 
recordings. 
</P>
<P>
 The Philharmonic promotes music education, especially in the public schools 
where music and art have been low priorities, and where the few posters that 
adorn the halls read, "If you see a gun, tell someone." 
</P>
<P>
 Genevieve Shepard, principal of Dublin Avenue Elementary Fundamental/Career 
Awareness School, said in a letter dated April 12 that the earthquake recovery 
concert "enraptured our students with the beauty of music." 
</P>
<P>
 "I am sure it will have a long-lasting effect on their lives and will inspire 
them to not only attend concerts, but to make good music a part of their 
lives," she wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 My belief in the spiritually nourishing power of great music was again 
reaffirmed with Northridge resident Yazmin Castiel's letter dated Feb. 18, 
detailing how she and her husband had found a pair of Philharmonic tickets in 
the debris of their home after the quake and made a point to attend because 
they needed a respite. 
</P>
<P>
 "Amid all the rubble at our home, we came across . . . two wet and partly 
mutilated L.A. Philharmonic tickets for last Saturday," Mrs. Castiel writes. 
"We did not hesitate to attend the performance because we felt that after all 
that had happened we needed something special to soothe our soul. 
</P>
<P>
 "The concert not only brought some sense of peace to our minds but it also 
revived our wishes to continue living in Los Angeles. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration recently enacted "Goals 2000: Educate America," 
significant in that it includes the arts in the core curriculum of public 
schools. Now all of us involved with, and/or touched by, music and arts 
education -- the sacrificial lamb in previous belt-tightening years -- must 
seize this chance at revival. 
</P>
<P>
 Studies have shown that children who participate in the arts do score higher 
in math and science tests. Imagine what a truly great country the United States 
would be if we were all better educated. 
</P>
<P>
 I urge everyone to write representatives and call for a commitment to back 
increased funding for the arts and education.

COUNTERPUNCH: WHY DRAMATIZE WHEN WE WERE ALL EYEWITNESSES? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID LINK, David Link is a story analyst and screenwriter in Los Angeles. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Greg Braxton's musings as to why no one has planned a TV movie about the 1992 
L.A. riots misses the most obvious reason ("Network Steering Clear of TV 
Projects on the L.A. Riots," Calendar, April 28). He interviewed people who 
claimed the riots are too big and all-encompassing to make a movie, or too 
violent and painful, or that racism prevents executives from being interested. 
The reason is much simpler if you think about why we have docudramas in the 
first place. 
</P>
<P>
 News stories about even the most monumental events are generally limited by 
their very nature. Except in the most unusual cases, news reporters, like the 
police, don't get to the scene until the juiciest stuff has already happened. 
What we generally see on the news is the aftermath of some terrible occurrence: 
the grieving widow, the mutilated body, the effects rather than the events. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason we love drama is that it takes us right to the heart of events. 
Action is what makes drama compelling. TV news reports, like testimony from 
witnesses in court, has dramatic content, but the drama is once removed. It's 
not often that Action News can actually show us action, that Eyewitness News is 
really an eyewitness. 
</P>
<P>
 That is the appeal of docudramas. They can take us imaginatively where cameras 
and reporters could not go. The examples of TV movies Braxton cites illustrate 
this reality. 
</P>
<P>
 From Tonya and Nancy to the World Trade Center bombing to the Waco tragedy, TV 
docudramas took the audience into those parts of the story that we could only 
hear about on the news. We had seen Nancy Kerrigan's pained face, but what led 
up to that moment? What was going on inside in the Branch Davidian compound, or 
behind the scenes with the federal agents, that the news couldn't show us? 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike those events, the L.A. riots occurred before our very eyes. From the 
videotape of Rodney G. King's beating, through news footage of the parallel 
brutality Reginald O. Denny survived, and on to the fires, the looting, the 
sheer chaos that engulfed the city, we have already seen the most dramatic 
events the riots had to offer.  
</P>
<P>
 No square inch of the city was camera-less as the riots unfolded. Since we've 
already seen just about all the action there was to see, there would be no more 
reason to re-enact those events in a TV movie than there would be to re-enact a 
Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 The fact that anyone even wants a TV movie about the riots demonstrates a sad 
fact about our culture -- how much we rely on other people's imaginations in 
our story-sodden age. Docudrama writers have access to the same universe of 
facts, lies and competing stories the rest of us do. Out of that chaos, they 
select what they imagine to be the "real" story. But given the fact that people 
lie, sometimes very well, every "real" story is usually just a series of best 
guesses, intuitions about the truth. Docudrama exploits this, appeals to our 
discomfort with contradiction; that is why they usually claim to be the True 
Story of (fill in the blank). 
</P>
<P>
 But, aside from imagination, there is no universally accepted story of the 
Menendez murders for those of us who were not there. That's why there are two 
docudramas about what happened that night. There were three about Amy Fisher. 
Any one of us could come up with a coherent version of events after sifting 
through the complex facts of those and other stories the news has inflated into 
sensation. But it's easier to let someone else do the imagining. 
</P>
<P>
 There is nothing fundamentally wrong with docudramas, I guess, as long as we 
realize they're based on convenience, voyeurism and not much else. The problem 
with Braxton's article is that it makes it appear that the lack of a TV movie 
about the riots is somehow important. It's not. On the contrary, maybe the 
riots are too important to be diminished by docudrama's relentless pandering to 
our own passivity. That kind of thing is acceptable when the subject is Tonya 
Harding and Nancy Kerrigan. It's not when you're dealing with something as 
profound as what happened in April of 1992.

DANCE; 'NIGHT IN THE KRATON' DELIGHTS AND DISCONCERTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEWIS SEGAL, TIMES DANCE WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 To pat itself on the back for founding campus gamelan studies 40 years ago, 
UCLA staged an alternately fascinating and frustrating quasi-Javanese event on 
Friday titled "A Night in the Kraton," enlisting its own performing ensembles 
and artists from CalArts and San Diego State, plus guests courtesy of the 
Indonesian consulate. 
</P>
<P>
 The program began at 7 in the Sunset Village Northwest Auditorium with 
speeches and a slide show summarizing the history and influence of UCLA gamelan 
studies. It ended well past 12:30 in the Grand Horizon Room of Griffin Commons 
with a traditional Javanese shadow-puppet drama embellished for the occasion 
with jokes (in English) about ethnomusicology. 
</P>
<P>
 With the audience seated at tables on two sides of a central playing area, the 
Griffin Commons ballroom resembled a Stateside supper club more than an antique 
Javanese palace pavilion. Moreover, this layout gave the only ideal view of the 
dancing to a pseudo-sultan and his court on a dais at the end of the room. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, the opening night of the 1990 L.A. Festival at the County 
Arboretum had a genuine Javanese sultan in attendance but offered everyone good 
sight-lines for Javanese court dance. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the sole advantage of the UCLA venue proved to be acoustics (the big 
drawback at the 1990 festival): No matter what you could -- or couldn't -- see, 
the shimmering richness and distinctively smoky tone of the Gamelan Kyai 
Mendung filled the space with glory. 
</P>
<P>
 After a procession depicting Central Javanese court protocol, a seven-woman 
group from CalArts offered a tense, uneven attempt at the sublime unisons of 
the Bedhaya (Bedoyo) ritual. Much better: The fierce, formal sword-and-spear 
manipulations of the Lawung, as performed by Bandoro Raden Mas Bambang Irawan, 
Sunarno Purwolelono and I Nyoman Wenten. 
</P>
<P>
 Best of all, perhaps: Irawan's wondrously supple, expressive dancing in a 
masked solo, "Klana Topeng." With his spectacular balances, gestural intensity 
and intricate shoulder bravura, this distinguished visitor from the court of 
Surakarta embodied the physical range and brilliance of a great tradition. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, to view the shadow-puppet drama (an episode from "The 
Mahabharata"), you had to go out on the terrace, where Sunset Boulevard traffic 
noise blanketed the music and dialogue. Inside the room, you missed the shadow 
effects but could hear the music fully -- and appreciate the skill and wit of 
Oemartopo, the fine narrator/puppeteer. 
</P>
<P>
 The evening also offered traditional Javanese food -- excellent, according to 
those who braved the endless buffet lines. Some of us found the campus 
fast-food emporium across the street easier and more pleasant, rushing there 
the same way we might have dashed from the Kraton in Yogyakarta to the stalls 
and stands just outside.

ART REVIEW; 'LIMBO': SAAR'S SIGNATURE ON THE SHADOWS OF REALITY; THE L.A. 
ARTIST SHOWS THAT FOLK BELIEFS EXIST ON A PAR WITH INSTITUTIONAL RELIGIONS AND 
GREAT PHILOSOPHIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM WILSON, TIMES ART CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Betye Saar is now in her late 60s. For nearly four decades she has occupied a 
unique niche in L.A. art using precious junk to talk about her life, which 
happens to be the life of an African American woman. Using stereotypes like 
Aunt Jemimah and Uncle Tom, she has told us that prejudice turns everyone into 
corroded caricatures. Them and us. Us and them. 
</P>
<P>
 She has never, however, been an ideologue. This does not signal lack of 
courage, but rather a more intuitive and poetic focus on the human condition. 
It has to do, I think, with a desire to show that folk beliefs like those in 
voodoo, divination and astrology ultimately exist on par with those of great 
institutional religions and philosophies. She builds a zinger into the 
proposition by showing these "superstitions" to possess greater pith in the 
evocation of life's enigmatic magic. This has never been clearer than in her 
new installation at the Santa Monica Museum of Art. 
</P>
<P>
 Called "Limbo: A Transitional State or Place," it is like a vivid variation on 
the most famous western philosophical metaphor, Plato's Cave. In it the great 
man compared this world to a cave where we see only shadows of luminous 
reality. 
</P>
<P>
 Saar's pieces read separately, but their cumulative effect is more telling. 
The show opens with a blue neon sign spelling "Limbo." The view of the main 
room is veiled by a hanging cloth bearing silhouettes of three figures. In the 
semi-darkness beyond are tableaux. A canoe is suspended mid-room over a river 
of wooden sticks. (If this is a pun on Dante's crossing of the river Styx, the 
artist is to be forgiven.) Two child's chairs rest in the little boat, between 
them are a brace of burning white candles. The ensemble plainly introduces 
notions of a journey requiring innocence and faith. Saar's attitude of slightly 
humorous detachment is more subtle and reassuring. This isn't as scary as it 
looks, kids. 
</P>
<P>
 Deftly, the artist makes the stages of the journey easy to track. A tube of 
white gauze hanging in one corner contains another child's chair, also white. A 
metal heart is attached to the back. More candles rest on the seat, but now 
they are electric imitations. A dais of white plastic flowers supports the 
whole. Here innocence is lost to the artificial purity of mystical marriage to 
religion. Has everything turned fake? 
</P>
<P>
 Not quite. The chair points in the direction of a diaphanous black gown. 
Suspended from the ceiling on a wire coat-hanger, it turns slowly above a pair 
of footprints painted on the floor. Provocative and sexy in suggestion it's 
real in a way the white sepulcher is not. Lit from the same corner where the 
chair stands, it casts a singular shadow. This shade seems surprisingly more 
real than the gown itself. It represents, I think, the dawning of that carnal 
drive that is so strong it makes us willing to accept life's fictions. 
</P>
<P>
 Consummation is embodied in the next way station. Saar casts it using the 
techniques of California Light and Space art to create a medieval memento mori. 
A bed of bare metal springs is suspended at an angle from the ceiling. From it 
dangle various voodoo amulets representing all the incantations addressed to 
romance to keep alive the hope it will function as a substitute for 
transcendence. 
</P>
<P>
 Once again, what we cannot see in the reality of these tawdry springs, we see 
in a shadow. Cast large on the wall, it reveals a pair of human skeletons on 
the bed. All available hopes of transcendence are now exhausted, illusion turns 
back to reality and both are but shadows. 
</P>
<P>
 Saar has invested Plato's Cave with nuances of poignancy, but she tries to go 
further. The final tableau abandons shadow for substance. It's all coppery 
autumn browns, a waterfall of dead leaves surrounds an iconic abstract 
sculpture. Hands lifted in supplication reach toward it hoping again for 
something. What? Wisdom? A private spirituality that is somehow also universal? 
</P>
<P>
 The walls go blank save a quote about tears from poet Michael Leiris and the 
timeless plea, "Remember my name!"

DANCE REVIEW; SILAYAN TROUPE DRAWS ON ETHNIC ROOTS FOR LATC PROGRAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JENNIFER FISHER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Watching the Silayan Dance Company in "Wings in Flight," a mixed program at 
the Tom Bradley Theater of Los Angeles Theatre Center on the weekend, one could 
sense it is a company in process. 
</P>
<P>
 The clues were in the contrasts: lively Philippine folk tales told sing-song 
brightly, as if for children, next to an elegiac, moody, modern dance solo, and 
virtuosic dancers who speedily sliced through space one moment and joined 
stately processions of Muslim dances the next. 
</P>
<P>
 But no cultural whiplash injuries occurred; more interesting is Silayan's 
challenge for us to rethink the evolutions of "traditional" dance -- how it's 
never stood still, how it absorbs and transforms. While starting out by trying 
to do Philippine folk dance as it was danced "at home," the multiethnic company 
is now branching further out under the direction of founder Sonia Capadocia's 
daughter, Dulce. 
</P>
<P>
 The younger Capadocia's choreography was straightforwardly mimetic in works 
like "Juan and the Crocodile" (with an athletic, four-person beast and the 
agile antics of Manop Buranapramest as Juan), but was more inventive in the 
subtle touches of "The Legend of the Mayon Volcano," the story of doomed lovers 
based on Igorot tribal myth. A mesmerizing bathing scene was created with the 
sultry yet detached swaying unison walk of handmaidens, who then settled into 
lyrical gathering and washing motions that seemed stirred by a gentle, unseen 
breeze. 
</P>
<P>
 Light, wave-like breaths and side-to-side shifts were present in much of 
Capadocia's movement, echoing motifs in her staging of Muslim dances such as 
"Katsuduratan," and her reconstruction of Ramon Obusan's "Malakas at Maganda," 
a sweetly simple creation-myth dance. 
</P>
<P>
 More dramatic moments worked too (many men with long sticks), but for now, it 
seemed that the gentle, swaying part of Silayan is saying something essential 
about identity -- maybe the shifting part of identity that is still evolving.

POP MUSIC REVIEW; CADILLAC TRAMPS TAKE A DETOUR FROM NEW MATERIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE BOEHM 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The reliably hard-driving Orange County band the Cadillac Tramps took a large 
and loyal following on a typically sweat-soaked excursion on Friday at the 
Palace. But if the Tramps want to be able to take fans around the emotional 
bends as well as zoom down the high-energy speedway, they are going to have to 
load their concerts with all the options.At the Palace they failed to include 
some of the most powerful add-ons in their recently improved product line -- 
namely, some darkly telling songs from their new album, "It's Allright." 
</P>
<P>
 The Tramps have honed a double-guitar attack that is a sort of Yardbirds 
update in which punk drive is harnessed to old-line blues and rock 'n' roll 
licks, with razory guitar solos giving the band's blunt force a cutting edge. 
</P>
<P>
 Songs rode bouncing or churning punk-rock beats, and strong backing vocals 
gave choruses a lift behind front man Mike (Gabby) Gaborno's growly lead. 
Gaborno was an antic, Spanglish-spouting mixture of a homeboy, a shuffling 
hi-de-ho man, and an ample-bellied Falstaff. But in their single-minded 
devotion to a stomping good time, the Tramps passed up the chance for greater 
depth that their new material affords. MIKE BOEHM

POP MUSIC REVIEW; BLOOD OF ABRAHAM GOES BEYOND SHTICK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT LEVINE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Owing more to such angry rappers as Eazy-E (the executive producer of its 
debut album) than prototypal Jewish rappers the Beastie Boys, Blood of Abraham 
boldly takes Jewish rap beyond the realm of shtick with serious lyrics 
attacking prejudice and anti-Semitism. 
</P>
<P>
 In a dynamic show on Saturday at the Troubadour, the L.A. group proved to be a 
credible hip-hop act, even if it distinguished itself more for its lyrical 
perspective than its mostly hard-core beats.While the message was always 
effectively delivered by rappers Mazik and Benyad, the backing beats ranged 
from jazzy and innovative to uninspired. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bay Area post-punk band Overwhelming Colorfast preceded Blood of Abraham, 
bringing a distortion-heavy, twin-guitar attack to a set of well-written pop 
songs. At times reminiscent of Minnesota punk trailblazers Husker Du, the band 
never let its songs lose their energy and impact, even as it embedded them in 
layers of swirling, almost psychedelic guitar noise. 
</P>
<P>
 The most exciting moment of the show came when the group's guitarists and 
bassist joined Blood of Abraham for a jam that started with the anti-racism 
rant "Southern Comfort." The guitars seemed to inspire Blood of Abraham, 
finally making its music as fresh as its perspective. ROBERT LEVINE

TV REVIEW; HBO'S 'LOCK-UP' PROBES N.Y. PRISON LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT KOEHLER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nina Rosenblum and Jon Alpert's HBO documentary on New York City's largest 
prison, "Lock-Up: The Prisoners of Rikers Island," is sometimes as hopped up as 
some of the Rikers inmates, and shot in a style best summed up as 
videocam-with-an-attitude. It's not always clear where the exploration of the 
vast facility is going, and it's even less clear for whom it's intended. 
</P>
<P>
 On one hand, Rosenblum and Alpert indicate that they want kids to see their 
look behind bars: They end this 75-minute work with a repeat offender lecturing 
-- through the camera and to young viewers -- about staying out of trouble. 
It's a message that echoes "Scared Straight." 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, "Lock-Up" is definitely not for younger viewers. True to 
the freer-than-thou HBO tradition, the report's nudity and profanity would 
qualify it for an R rating, and, in any case, young kids might not understand 
the legal and institutional processes depicted. 
</P>
<P>
 Teens, though, can probably handle this attempt at a panoramic view of an 
obviously failing penal institution, where prisoners are being recycled through 
the system at an alarming rate. As we come to know certain inmates, such as 
HIV-positive and drug-addicted Jimmy Mirabel or Jackie, also addicted and nine 
months pregnant, we have to wonder how this place can possibly help them. 
</P>
<P>
 And when Jimmy is ultimately denied a request to transfer to a drug treatment 
clinic, it shocks us for a moment -- until the judge explains his ruling on the 
grounds that Jimmy has five prior convictions. Without context, Jimmy and 
others look like victims of the system, and "Lock-Up" often deliberately 
eliminates the context. It amounts to a deception of the viewer, which is 
especially inexcusable in a work purporting to give us the "inside truth" of 
the prison system. The system needs deep reform, but "Lock-Up" isn't the 
vehicle for promoting it. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Lock-Up: The Prisoners of Rikers Island" airs at 10:15 tonight on HBO, with 
repeats on June 9, 12, 22 and 28.

HOLDEN LEGAL COSTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the May 5 editorial, "Enough Already," you want the City Council to "find a 
way with the city attorney to bring the matter" of sexual harassment charges I 
have been accused of "to a close." I am completely innocent of the allegations 
and paying for these lies is not the right thing to do. 
</P>
<P>
 The city has been sued thousands of times over the years. Hundreds of council 
members have been sued over the years as council members, and at least four 
members of council have been sued, like myself, both as individuals and as 
council members. It's part of our litigious society and our city is no 
exception. 
</P>
<P>
 You say that the City Council has placed a $150,000 cap on my legal costs. 
That is a false statement! That $150,000 cap exists for four other members of 
my staff (three males and one female, all over the age of 60) who have also 
been accused of sexual harassment. However, there is no cap on legal fees for 
my defense.  
</P>
<P>
 It's ludicrous for you to suggest that council members pay my legal defense 
fees out of their office budgets. Even The Times admits that the council is 
"legally required" to pay the legal costs to defend me and the city.

REMEMBERING D-DAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Your D-day special edition (World Report, May 31) underscores the unlimited 
acts of courage and bravery demonstrated by American paratroopers, infantry, 
the Navy and so many other genuine heroes. I remember as a schoolboy on June 6 
that we were directed to the assembly hall where we joined in a prayer 
delivered by President Roosevelt over the radio for the safety of our troops. 
</P>
<P>
 What remains most memorable about that day and during all of World War II was 
the fact that it was the last time the people of the United States were totally 
unified in purpose. Everyone seemed to focus on whatever had to be done to 
achieve victory. If even a small percentage of that spirit would be present 
today, there would be no problem facing us that could not be confronted and 
overcome.

<P>
 Alexander Cockburn (Column Left, June 3), provides a necessary antidote to 
overwhelming D-day hype by correctly and courageously reminding us of the 
largely symbolic importance of Operation Overlord in the annals of military 
history. The Soviet Union bore the brunt of fighting the Nazis in World War II. 
The commemorative spectacle in Normandy is made the more galling when one bears 
in mind U.S. sponsorship of Axis war criminals during the Cold War. D-day 
should be a time of remembrance for all who dedicated themselves to fighting 
fascism. 
</P>

 Your articles and the television coverage (C-Span and other channels) are 
wonderful in their thorough presentation of the events of that memorable day in 
June, 1944. 
</P>
<P>
 Hovering in the background in the channel we see the battleships (the 
Arkansas) and cruisers firing their mighty guns to "soften up" the beachhead. 
And approaching the beaches we witness the incredibly brave drivers of the LSTs 
(landing ship tanks) and LCIs (landing craft infantry). And the soldiers, 
heroic beyond measure. 
</P>
<P>
 And yet, there are glaring omissions. Omissions of how the troops, their heavy 
weapons, the tanks, trucks, and Jeeps, the gasoline for those vehicles, the 
ammunition, the medical supplies, the basic foods, etc., got to England and to 
France. Look further and notice the cargo ships off-loading the troops into the 
LSTs and LCIs. These ships were manned by the "unsung civilian heroes" of the 
Merchant Marine and the equally gallant members of the U.S. Navy Armed Guard. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, the Jeremiah O'Brien, the last of the Liberty ships, sailing from San 
Francisco, has returned to the place where she received her baptism of fire. 
The O'Brien made 11 crossings of the English Channel during the weeks 
celebrated as the "invasion of Normandy." The troop-carrying cargo ship, the 
Susan B. Anthony, blew up in the channel with the death of hundreds of GIs and 
merchant and Navy crewmen. 
</P>
<P>
 The men who landed on the beaches of Normandy will never be forgotten. All we 
ask is that those brave men on the cargo ships, who faced the submarines and 
enemy airplanes in all theaters of the war, not go unnoticed. We were in the 
North Atlantic, on the Murmansk run, in the Mediterranean at Anzio, in the 
Pacific at Guadalcanal, Leyte Gulf and Okinawa delivering the men and the 
necessities. We lost 10,000 men.

 D-day, 1994. World War II, "the good war," has not been forgotten. No war is a 
good war. The loss of lives, the maiming of lives, the terrible destruction of 
property, the heartbreaks and tears hardly characterize any war as a good war. 
Retired Rear Adm. Gene La Rocque is quoted in Studs Terkel's World War II oral 
history book, "The Good War," as saying: "We have built up in our body politic 
a group of old men who look upon military service as a noble adventure. It was 
a big excitement of their lives and they'd like to see young people come along 
and share that excitement. . . . We've always gone somewhere else to fight our 
wars, so we've not really learned about its horror. . . . We've made war a 
religious act." 
</P>
<P>
 Vietnam was the first televised war and through TV we saw some of the horrors. 
I salute D-day because I don't think World War II should ever be forgotten, but 
La Rocque's words burn deeply in my soul.

 I recall my '60s generation confronting a police phalanx spread across the 
plazas of UCLA. Invigorated by yet another John Wooden championship, we 
gestured and flung trite phrases across the bucolic campus, bought with our 
parents' taxes. If things got hot with approaching summer, we descended the 
cliffs of Palisades Park and sprawled for a tan on the beaches of Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
 We now remember an earlier generation that struggled through the Depression to 
confront Nazi armies across the pastures of France. Invigorated by an ancient 
sense of duty, they flung themselves across bucolic Normandy. When things got 
hot, they sprawled for safety on the beaches of Omaha and ascended the cliffs 
of Pointe du Hoc. 
</P>
<P>
 With head now bowed in respect and not disdain, I raise my naked hand no 
longer clenched and say, "Right on. Thank you."

ANGELES FOREST: LOVING IT TO DEATH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 America's national parks have been the subject of hand-wringing this year as 
evidence accumulates on overuse that degrades the natural experience the parks 
were created to provide. Poor Yosemite. Poor Yellowstone. 
</P>
<P>
 However, what the national parks suffer is nothing compared to the human 
smothering of the Angeles National Forest, which sees more recreational use in 
a year than Yosemite and Yellowstone combined, according to Angeles Forest 
Supervisor Mike Rogers.  
</P>
<P>
 On a summer weekend, its accessible areas -- river bottoms, passes and meadows 
-- are jammed with Southern California urbanites seeking a day's contact with 
nature. Some of that contact unfortunately includes marking graffiti on rocks, 
littering and more serious crimes. Except Arizona's larger Tonto National 
Forest, near Phoenix, Angeles is the most used national forest. How, then, 
could its budget have been cut 20% from last year? 
</P>
<P>
 National forest budgets are rigid and complex, balanced between recreational 
and commercial uses. But if Americans could direct how their tax money was 
spent, it's a fair bet they would rather pay for recreation in national forests 
across the country than subsidize the building of roads used only by private 
timber operations in some federal forests. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angeles cuts have closed some of the most popular campgrounds to overnight 
camping; there is no money to maintain or refurbish the aging facilities. 
What's saved can help manage the flood of day users, though that's cold comfort 
to would-be campers. 
</P>
<P>
 One solution would be to allow national forests to charge an entry fee, like 
state and national parks. Rogers and others have proposed that Congress allow 
Angeles to develop a pilot program in which a small fee (perhaps $2 a day) 
would be collected and used locally rather than go into the common pot in 
Washington. Angeles is a logical site for such a program because it is used so 
heavily for recreation and not at all for logging. 
</P>
<P>
 The end of the free picnic may be in sight, and that's sad. But the 
alternative to fees may be a forest that we've loved into ruin.

THE HISTORIC RESULT OF A MONUMENTAL BLUNDER; D-DAY WAS MADE INEVITABLE WHEN 
HITLER DECLARED WAR ON THE UNITED STATES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There had been nothing like it before, and there would be nothing like it ever 
again. 
</P>
<P>
 The armada that 50 years ago today filled the English Channel from Britain's 
southern ports to the northern coast of France was made up of 5,333 ships and 
boats, more, the historian Samuel Eliot Morison would write, "than there were 
in all the world when Elizabeth I was Queen of England." Within a 24-hour 
period starting at first light on June 6, 1944, those vessels would land 
175,000 men and 50,000 vehicles on the beaches of Normandy. By the end of that 
first day nearly 5,000 of the American, British and Canadian troops in the 
invasion force would be casualties, among them paratroopers who had gone in 
hours before the first landing craft reached the beaches. 
</P>
<P>
 "With our brave allies and brothers-in-arms on other fronts, you will bring 
about the destruction of the German war machine," the supreme Allied commander, 
Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower, told his troops that morning. "You will bring about 
. . . the elimination of Nazi tyranny. . . . " It was a precise order. Eleven 
months later it would be fulfilled. 
</P>
<P>
 D-day, 1944, had been made inevitable 30 months earlier when Adolf Hitler made 
the monumental strategic blunder of declaring war on the United States. Once 
fully involved in the European war, the United States quickly agreed with its 
British and Soviet allies that defeating Germany would take precedence over the 
war against Japan. Once it was committed, the United States could mobilize the 
full potential of its industrial power for the global struggle. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1939, as Stephen E. Ambrose notes in his fine account, "D-Day," 
Depression-struck U.S. factories were still producing at only half their 
capacity and unemployment still stood at 20%. Four years later factory capacity 
had expanded many times over and U.S. assembly lines were turning out a 
mind-boggling 8,000 planes a month , along with thousands of trucks and tanks 
and millions of other weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the end victory would depend not just on materiel but on the 
steadfastness of Allied fighting men. The liberation of Europe could come only 
when the German army was driven out of the countries it had begun occupying in 
1939 and then was destroyed as an effective force on its home soil. It would 
come only when Germany was squeezed between Western armies driving across 
France and Belgium and the Red Army of the Soviet Union thrusting from the 
east, where war was waged with particular ferocity. (As Gerhard L. Weinberg 
writes in "A World at Arms," more people were killed on the eastern front -- 
most of them civilians -- than on all the rest of the world's fronts combined.) 
And it was the success of Operation Overlord, the opening of the long-awaited 
second front in Normandy, that assured the eventual victory. 
</P>
<P>
 That battle, in all its terror and confusion, is massively and vividly 
documented, from the level of supreme commander down to the infantry private. 
To read what the men who went ashore faced and suffered and triumphed over -- 
and thousands of hours of oral history provide graphic witness to what it was 
all about -- is at once stirring and horrifying. All wars are cruel and 
wasteful, all battles are brutal, all victories exact a fearsome price. The 
price exacted that day on French beaches code-named Utah, Omaha, Gold, Juno and 
Sword, and the price that would have to be paid in the months ahead, was high. 
But what was achieved in crushing Nazi despotism was beyond value. 
</P>
<P>
 A few days after the Normandy landing the great war correspondent Ernie Pyle 
began a column with these words: " . . . I want to tell you what the opening of 
the second front entailed, so that you can know and appreciate and forever be 
humbly grateful to those both dead and alive who did it for you." A 
half-century later, as the anniversary of that feat of arms is honored, 
gratitude and respect and humility in recalling the courage and sacrifice of 
that day continue to be compelled.

SCIENCE GRANT APPLICATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Times' article (May 25) and editorial (May 27) on the Los Angeles Unified 
School District's failure to receive a $15-million grant from the National 
Science Foundation are an insult to teachers. To present a fact that two 
classroom teachers were the point persons for the grant development process as 
the "explanation" for the problem is based on the patronizing assumption that 
teachers, however outstanding they might be, would not be competent to write a 
big-league grant. 
</P>
<P>
 While it was inept of the district not to have given adequate support to those 
teachers, it was a positive move by the district to have involved teachers. 
LAUSD would not even be in this grant process now except for their efforts. 
Let's set the record straight. 
</P>
<P>
 The grant application sat for over a year in the office of a top LAUSD 
bureaucrat. It was only through non-district sources that United Teachers Los 
Angeles (UTLA) even knew of the grant and proceeded to inquire about its 
status. In late May, 1993, the district finally responded and asked UTLA to 
find someone to work with Rebuild L.A. in an attempt to salvage the grant. 
LAUSD had six months to catch up with districts that would have had 18 months' 
effort on the project. 
</P>
<P>
 In record time, one teacher working with RLA and a major local university 
succeeded in getting the $100,000 planning grant. The second teacher was only 
hired Oct. 8. There were then only three months in which to complete the 
planning grant implementation while simultaneously preparing the grant 
application which might close the gap between LAUSD and competing districts. 
</P>
<P>
 It is absolutely false that university level consultation was avoided. A major 
local university provided a writer who actually composed much of the proposal. 
It is absolutely false that there was no collaboration with LEARN. There were 
three or four meetings during the fall of 1993 with LEARN liaisons. In fact, 
LEARN is a major part of the systemic change described in the application. 
</P>
<P>
 It is absolutely true that it is only because of the herculean efforts of the 
teachers and others working together at the last minute that the grant is even 
within striking distance of winning approval at this juncture. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Science Foundation understood the time constraints for LAUSD and 
still encouraged the teachers to proceed with the process. The foundation did 
praise many elements in the initial grant and indicated that a revision and 
re-submission of the application would be welcomed. The grant proposal is now 
being rewritten and by all accounts has a good chance of being accepted.  
</P>
<P>
 The teachers involved in this effort should be credited for getting this far 
in so short a time. Supt. Sid Thompson should be credited for acting to take 
the application off an inert bureaucrat's desk.

DESERT PROTECTION BILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Never before have I read anything in The Times that appalled and infuriated me 
as did the May 26 editorial, "Don't Gut Desert Protection Bill." How dare you 
advocate banning from a huge section of the eastern Mojave desert the group 
that has done more for genuine conservation and habitat preservation than all 
other such groups combined -- hunters! 
</P>
<P>
 The people you would bar from the desert are the ones who brought wildlife 
back from its condition of near-extinction at the turn of the century to its 
present state of abundance. Shame on you! The people you would ban from the 
desert are the ones who contribute nearly a billion dollars per year to such 
things as habitat enhancement projects so that our wild creatures can find a 
place to live in today's crowded world.

PERSPECTIVES ON D-DAY; WAR'S WORST RISK IS TO THE SOUL; THE MEMORIALS ALWAYS 
OMIT THE FULL MEASURE OF OUR DEBT -- TURNING MEN INTO WARRIORS WHO KILLED IN 
OUR NAME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The season of war ceremonies has only begun with the President's visit to the 
American cemetery outside Rome and the memorial at Omaha Beach. With the 50th 
anniversaries of V-E Day and V-J Day approaching, war observances will 
intensify. These parades, concerts and unveilings are much appreciated by those 
who served our nation in uniform. They're a welcome contrast to the immediate 
post-Vietnam era. However, in an important sense, they are incomplete. 
</P>
<P>
 These ceremonies focus on the sacrifices of those who fought. The speeches and 
writings praise those who risked their lives and, especially, those who gave 
their lives for their country. There's nothing wrong with this. Quite the 
contrary, it's entirely honorable and proper to praise the sacrifice of others. 
But war is more than sacrifice. War is more than exposing your body to injury 
and your future to death. Warriors do more than put their bodies at risk. 
Warriors kill. Killing is the essence of war. When we, as a nation, send our 
sons to battle, we ask more than sacrifice. We want victory. We arm our 
warriors with knife and gun, with bayonet and bomb, then tell them to win. We 
order them to kill. In our name. 
</P>
<P>
 As horrific as killing is, it isn't even the worst of war. The full measure of 
war is cruel to the spirit. Warriors must do more than kill. To succeed on the 
battlefield, the warrior must aggressively search out the enemy, kill that man 
and pursue his next victim. He must bare his soul and attack. When attacking, 
warriors must want to kill. This is the personal horror of war. Sports 
columnists and coaches blithely refer to the "killer instinct." On the 
battlefield, this instinct is very real. Absent this instinct, the warrior 
comes home either very lucky or very dead. Worst of all, he may come home 
defeated. 
</P>
<P>
 When Joshua Chamberlain led the 20th Maine's bayonet charge down Little Round 
Top, his men had to bare their souls. Their heads may have convinced them to 
fight for a cause; their hearts may have told them to fight for their buddies. 
But how does a man want to run a bayonet through the face, the gut of a fellow 
man? How do you shoot another human in the face, then aggressively move on to 
your next victim? Marines at Tarawa, airmen over Germany and submariners with 
enemy troop ships in their sights faced the same challenge. Each made the same 
decision. Because of their acts we have victories to celebrate, not defeats to 
rue. 
</P>
<P>
 This desire to kill is foreign to everything we're taught. Our Declaration of 
Independence says that "all men are created equal, that they are endowed by 
their Creator with certain inalienable rights, that among these are life, 
liberty, and the pursuit of happiness." The Commandments state, "Thou shalt not 
kill." The best of us believe these words. But warriors put these words aside. 
They suppress the words in order to aggressively seek out and destroy another 
man's life. 
</P>
<P>
 However, when the fight is over, the words return. "Thou shalt not kill." When 
the fight is over, the images and sounds of battle return and never go away. 
Blood spurting; a burning town; cries for help; the full impact of what you've 
done -- and the full realization that you wanted to do it. It's at that point, 
and forever after, the nation must pay its debt to the warrior. The nation must 
tell the warrior that his actions were right and just and honorable. Having 
done his nation's bidding, the warrior must not face his soul alone. The nation 
must stand beside its killers, because the nation, not the warrior, created 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 Our nation well honors its veterans for risking life and limb. However, we 
seldom praises veterans for risking their souls. The speeches and memorials 
rarely mention the full toll of war. That is a shame. When the nation fails to 
comfort those who killed in its name, it leaves those warriors to face their 
souls alone. That is too much for a great and caring America to ask.

PERSPECTIVES ON D-DAY; ONE PERSON, ONE VOTE (EASTSIDE EXCEPTED); SCHOOLS: A 2-1 
VOTE FOR A TRADITIONAL SCHEDULE LOSES TO A 'CONSENSUS' FOR YEAR-ROUND USE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The inequity is so stark, it's startling. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the year-round calendar was the single noisiest issue on the Los 
Angeles Board of Education's agenda. San Fernando Valley parents screamed about 
105-degree classroom temperatures in summer; Westside parents decried the lack 
of camps in January. Parents everywhere denounced the cost of year-round day 
care for kids on different calendars. The school board, sympathetic, mandated 
elections at 544 schools -- most in the Valley and the Westside -- to allow 
them to choose a calendar. All but one elected to return to the traditional 
September-to-June year. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, 37 Eastside schools no longer deemed overcrowded were deprived of 
their right to the same vote. Instead, the Board of Education quietly ordered 
these largely Latino schools to set calendars by "consensus." At my daughter's 
school, Euclid Avenue Elementary in Boyle Heights, we held a campus election 
before the district's new instructions came out. The traditional calendar won 
by a nearly 2-1 vote, 414-225. Yet a year-round schedule was declared the 
victor by "consensus." 
</P>
<P>
 Come again? 
</P>
<P>
 As it turned out, this sleight of hand was conceived by the district staff and 
Helen Bernstein, president of the teachers' union, United Teachers of Los 
Angeles; it gives teachers effective veto power over the calendar. Bernstein 
recently acknowledged that she and the superintendent of schools had come to an 
"agreement" to forgo elections on the calendar issue this year. Instead, they 
agreed to utilize a "consensus model" previously used only by schools 
requesting it for specific purposes. The board, with utterly no public 
discussion as to the impact on thousands of lives, went along. 
</P>
<P>
 Under this new "consensus" model, no change can be made unless four so-called 
equal stakeholders in a child's education -- three of them employee bargaining 
units, the fourth parents -- agree. Because teachers at many schools prefer a 
year-round program, the results were predictable: If we parents wanted 
year-round, we got year-round by "consensus"; if we wanted the traditional 
year, we got year-round by lack of "consensus." Heads they win, tails we lose. 
</P>
<P>
 Our school gained notoriety because the staff-dominated leadership council 
also claimed that year-round had actually won in a fair election: A so-called 
"ratio of equality" gave 6.3 votes to every teacher, aide, administrator and 
part-time cafeteria worker. 
</P>
<P>
 For a school that teaches democracy, what does this say to our kids? For a 
district that promotes parent involvement, what lesson does it send Eastside 
parents -- that we and our children literally don't count? 
</P>
<P>
 In case board members have forgotten how strongly they felt about this issue 
last year, let me remind them. Julie Korenstein said it was so obvious the 
year-round calendar "just wasn't working" that she wanted to impose the 
traditional calendar and spare everyone the "tizzy" of elections. Jeff Horton 
said that to leave any schools year-round was to "abandon any commitment to 
equity." Leticia Quezada said that leaving overcrowded schools on year-round 
calendar was "the biggest failure in my term on the board." Mark Slavkin said 
that the voting "reflects a clear majority" for the traditional calendar. 
</P>
<P>
 So what's going on here? Have they all changed their minds, or do they really 
think that Eastside parents can find camps in January, can afford year-round 
day care, can manage a family vacation when one child needs to be driven to 
school virtually every weekday of the year? 
</P>
<P>
 Most board members have now denounced Euclid's unique "ratio of equality." Yet 
all, so far, have remained mute on Bernstein's public revelations and refused 
to give us the simple dignity of elections. Confronted with having to choose 
between the powerful UTLA and the American principle of one person, one vote, 
the board is about to spend thousands of taxpayer dollars to send our school a 
team of mediators to develop a "win-win situation" that we are told will "save 
face" for the UTLA. 
</P>
<P>
 Sure, we'll talk. But what happens if we refuse to compromise because we 
believe that a democratic vote is something you can't yield on? We won with 65% 
of the vote. Bill Clinton won with a mere 43% and nobody asked him to go to 
mediation.

PERSPECTIVES ON D-DAY; ON OMAHA BEACH, AMERICA BIDS FAREWELL TO EUROPE; THE 
CLINTON GENERATION'S ENERGIES ARE FOCUSED ON ASIA; OUR CONTINENTAL FIXATION 
RECEDES TO THE SENTIMENTAL PAST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

the Los Angeles Times Syndicate and of New Perspectives Quarterly magazine.

<TEXT>
<P>
 The import of President Clinton's participation in the 50th-anniversary 
celebrations of D-day is that it marks America's historical farewell to Europe. 
While America's cultural mind-set will of course remain in the Western 
humanistic tradition born in Europe, its destiny is now more linked to Asia. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton is the first American President with a post-Atlanticist imagination. 
Unlike any previous U.S. leader in the post-World War II era, Clinton's 
formative experiences had more to do with Ho Chi Minh and Honda than Stalin or 
Churchill. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's experiences as a student activist were focused on the Vietnam War; 
his experiences as a governor, like most American governors in the 1970s and 
'80s, were focused on the issues of jobs, education and training linked to 
"competitiveness" vis-a-vis the Japanese juggernaut and its Asian-tiger 
neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 None of this is to say that Clinton will be irresponsible concerning America's 
commitments in Europe, or that he lacks the proper respect for those who died 
on the battlefields of Europe to make the world safe for democracy. But the 
emotive element of Clinton's presidency is elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 How Clinton thinks about Europe is probably very similar to the way most 
Americans do. That view was perhaps best, if inadvertently, expressed by former 
Vice President Walter Mondale, who came to Washington after Clinton was elected 
looking for a "serious" job. When offered an ambassadorship to Britain or 
France, Mondale said, "No thanks, I'll pay for my own vacations." He was later 
posted with satisfaction as ambassador to Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 The initiative and momentum in the Clinton Administration is all focused on 
Asia. The convening of Asia's heads of state for the first time at the 
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meeting last year is still the only major 
foreign-policy initiative that belongs entirely to Clinton.  
</P>

 No government has taken a tougher stance on the Japanese trade surplus than 
this Administration. Clinton has called his decision on China's 
most-favored-nation status "of historic importance." He has spent much more 
time agonizing over whether coddling the geriatric mandarins of Beijing for a 
while longer will buy enough open-market space to finally do them in than he 
has thought about the alternative to Boris Yeltsin in Russia or Saddam Hussein 
in Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's proclivity toward Asian concerns makes sense for America; indeed it 
is the aspect of his foreign policy that is most cogent because it is most 
linked to the reconstruction of the American economy, which is what he was 
elected to do. It is clear that Asia, with its rapid growth rates and rising 
middle class, will be the world's economic locomotive in the 21st Century.  
</P>
<P>
 Issues from caning to the unfair practices of communitarian capitalism in Asia 
will present plenty of grist for conflict across the Pacific in the coming 
years. Indeed, one can argue that, unlike the Atlantic Ocean, the Pacific is a 
vast epistemological gulf between civilizations. The world simply does not look 
the same from the east coast of the Pacific as it does from the west. We may 
squabble with the French over movie revenues, but neither side questions the 
Declaration of the Rights of Man. While the Lone Ranger is the mythic emblem on 
this side of the Pacific, the Japanese motto is "hammer down all nails" so that 
individualism does not disrupt the harmony of a productive community. 
</P>
<P>
 Even greater conflict looms. The Japanese, for example, harbor a suspicion of 
organ transplants enabled by the scientific definition of "brain death." 
According to Shinto religious tradition, the traces of which still shape the 
average person's beliefs, the spirit exists not only in the mind, but in matter 
and the body as well. The Japanese assumption that follows from this, "I am, 
therefore I think," could not be further from the Cartesian notion upon which 
"brain death" (and the Western world view) is predicated -- "I think, therefore 
I am." Civilizational clashes don't get much deeper than that. 
</P>
<P>
 All this will concentrate the strategic mind wonderfully and provide a foil 
for America to define its leadership role at the millennium as the last Western 
superpower. 
</P>
<P>
 America's security role in Europe will become even fuzzier after the 50th 
anniversary of D-day, which has been so hyped that when it is all over a sense 
of closure will set in. After all, the security problem in Europe has become 
one that the Europeans themselves can handle, especially given the simultaneous 
collapse of the Soviet Union and the sustained progress that Europe has made 
toward unity. 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, the extraordinarily impressive economic progress in East Asia, as 
Zbigniew Brzezinski has often pointed out, coincides with a persistent security 
vacuum. China, Japan, Russia and maybe even a unified Korea will emerge in the 
coming years as contenders for regional power. Only the United States can still 
provide the kind of distanced stabilizing role there that it usefully provided 
in Europe until the fall of the Berlin Wall.  
</P>
<P>
 America's critical role is to help the Asian giant arise in a way that doesn't 
threaten the liberal world order. The slumbering giant awakening in Asia today 
is not the peasant mass that took China down the communist path half a century 
ago and sapped the American spirit in the humid reaches of the Mekong Delta; it 
is the rising middle class that will consume and compete in the same world 
marketplace where Americans have set up shop.

PERSPECTIVES ON D-DAY; COMING TO GRIPS WITH A BATTLEFIELD VOW; ALTER THE 
CHILDHOOD FICTION THAT WAR IS A GAME, AND AVOID ALL CONFLICTS NOT VITAL TO LIFE 
AND LIBERTY.

<P>
 Fifty years have passed since Allied forces invaded France during World War 
II, but the memories of my experiences as a 19-year-old infantryman remain. As 
a psychoanalyst, my reminiscences have been filtered through a magnified 
perspective of self-observation. I still have visions of the aftermath of 
battles: mutilated GI bodies near our lines and, as we advanced, hundreds of 
bloated bodies of German soldiers, along with multitudes of civilians lying on 
the steps next to their homes and in their doorways and yards. I relive battles 
in fantasies and dreams. Amid these thoughts comes the face of my friend, 
Ronnie Helps, who never came home. 
</P>
<P>
 As a child, I could hardly wait till Saturdays, to see the Hollywood movies of 
the Great War. I wore the pilot's helmet with goggles my parents had bought to 
keep me warm against the winter snows of Detroit, and pretended to be the 
American ace who shot down German planes. These boyhood fantasies and the 
illusion of personal immortality for the most part protected me on the 
battlefield from an overwhelming dread of death. 
</P>
<P>
 On the battlefield, there were times when I imagined we were engaged in a 
gigantic football game, with victory inevitable for the deserving side. During 
the Battle of the Bulge, as the Germans began to surround us, our platoon 
leader, Lt. Felice R. Ippolito, chose four men to move to a dangerous rear 
perimeter to cover our retreat if it became necessary. He ignored me, 
considering others braver and more reliable. I felt hurt, as if I had not made 
the first team, but some part of me recognized how senseless such a feeling 
was. This was not a football game. The men selected stood a high chance of 
being killed.  
</P>
<P>
 There were even moments during the fighting when I imagined that what I was 
watching was a scene from a Saturday afternoon movie, and how exciting it would 
have been to my childhood friends and me. Even a sense of surrealism arose the 
morning we advanced on the enemy through the rubble of a burning German village 
that U.S. and British artillery had just leveled. I spotted the torn pages of a 
book in German at my feet, flapping in the breeze on the floor of the remnants 
of what had been the bedroom of a house and now was an empty shell without 
walls. The title caught my eye: "All Quiet on the Western Front," an anti-war 
novel written by a German soldier after World War I. War was still partially a 
game till the night the German shells trapped several of our companies crossing 
an open field, where we had no chance to dig foxholes. Men screamed helplessly 
as the shells landed, one after another, around us. There was nothing to do 
except to try to dig into the frozen soil with our shovels. I plunged my body 
behind a slight mound of earth. The ground was too hard to break. Our artillery 
responded, and after an hour or longer, the German 88s stopped firing. Men 
everywhere around me lay moaning or silently dead. Miraculously, I was 
unharmed. Still trembling with fear, those of us who could walk arose and 
returned to our lines as the medics arrived to carry off the wounded and the 
dead.  
</P>
<P>
 Now my illusion of immortality had been ripped away. I choked with fear as my 
heart pounded in my chest. I wanted to run away or cry like a baby or fall on 
my knees and beg the Army to let me out because I knew I would die in the next 
attack, but I remained silent. The following morning, I learned that Ronnie 
Helps had been killed in the same shelling that I had survived. My 
ever-smiling, good-natured friend, during both school and Army training, was 
gone. Now emotionally cognizant that I too could be killed, I prayed to the 
Lord, whose existence I doubted. I vowed that if He allowed me to survive and 
return home, no travail in life would cause me to suffer. If someone burned my 
house to ashes, if fortune kicked me as I lay helpless on the ground, all would 
be met with a resilient laugh and a hearty silent "the devil take you -- I'm 
still alive." And above all, I would help inform people of the realities of the 
games I played as a boy, which made me so receptive to war.  
</P>
<P>
 I eventually came home, where I have lived for half a century while Ronnie has 
lain in his grave in the American cemetery in Maastricht, Holland. The ordinary 
vicissitudes of living arose, along with the competitive struggles required to 
attain a place in life for my family and myself. My ambitions and self-concerns 
grew even beyond what was necessary for a comfortable existence. The pledges to 
help others, to be of use to the world, to work to protect our youth from the 
myths of war, once sacred vows on the battlefield, shrank and devolved into 
largely personal gratification.  
</P>
<P>
 How easy it is to forget the lessons I thought I had learned: that Ronnie and 
several hundred-thousand American servicemen like him, along with multitudes of 
Allied fighters, gave up all their possessions and all their pleasures for 
those of us remaining to have the opportunity to enjoy life; that death is 
forever, and that it is too easy to forget those to whom we owe everything. I 
had forgotten my promise to strive as mightily as possible to alter the 
childhood fiction that war is just another exciting game, and to remove the 
delusion of personal invulnerability and denial of pain inflicted upon others 
in a society so prone to wars and violence.  
</P>
<P>
 I had hoped that this might eliminate one of the major unconscious motivations 
to war and might avoid some conflicts that are less than absolutely necessary 
for the preservation of life or the fundamental principles in which we believe. 
I believe Ronnie would have smiled at this.

ORANGE COUNTY VOICES; HISTORY HOLDS LESSON IN TOLL ROAD SUCCESS; HIGHWAYS WERE 
BUILT BY PRIVATE INITIATIVES, RELYING ON REVENUE, NOT TAXPAYERS, TO KEEP THEM 
UP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL B. KLEIN and CHI YIN, Daniel Klein, an assistant professor of 
economics at UC Irvine, and Chi Yin, a graduate student, recently completed a 
historical study of California toll roads. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For generations Californians have known only freeways. Now toll road projects 
are underway in Orange County and planned elsewhere in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 But a century ago, these developments would be old hat. In old California, 
most good highways were built by private initiative as toll roads. Californians 
can gain perspective on today's developments by knowing a bit of history. 
</P>
<P>
 There were about 20,000 people in the territory in 1848 when James Marshall 
struck gold. California became a state in 1850 and by 1852 its population had 
increased tenfold. 
</P>
<P>
 Administrative government was nonexistent. Yet somehow folks carried on. For 
example, miners developed their own working customs of law, which later came to 
be codified in government law. 
</P>
<P>
 The state government borrowed traditions from the other states and permitted 
the formation of toll road companies.  
</P>
<P>
 Private toll roads had decisive advantages over government road care. Some 
problems with government road care were separation of funding and service, weak 
incentives, inflexible funding, political jobbery, little entrepreneurship. In 
comparison, toll road companies gathered responsibility and financing for the 
entire route under a board of directors. Also, the tollkeeper was a vital 
figure, for he acted as security guard, custodian, handyman and company 
representative. 
</P>
<P>
 But most important, toll roads drew from users rather than the general 
taxpayer. Toll revenue replenished the pool of funds from which to pay out 
maintenance costs or company dividends. This sparked individuals to undertake 
road construction. 
</P>
<P>
 The most active area of toll road construction was the Motherlode region of 
the Sierra Nevada. But toll roads reached most regions of the state. Besides 
serving miners, toll roads served farmers, ranchers, lumbermen and San 
Francisco suburbanites. All told, about 150 toll roads were put into operation 
between 1850 and 1902. 
</P>
<P>
 Typically, toll roads were built in hopes of company dividends. For example, 
numerous privately operated toll roads were built to service tourism in the 
Yosemite Valley, both long before and after the establishment of the National 
Park in 1890. 
</P>
<P>
 But often local interests undertook toll roads largely for their 
transportation services -- just as large developers today have donated vast 
tracts of land to the Transportation Corridor projects in Orange County. Often 
mining companies opened toll roads more for use than dividends. In San 
Bernardino County, the Highland Lumber Co. and the Arrowhead Reservoir Company 
each built a toll road in 1891. 
</P>
<P>
 We have gathered quotations from historians of various California counties -- 
Kern, Santa Clara, Lake, Shasta, Santa Barbara, San Joaquin, El Dorado, Nevada, 
Trinity -- all to the effect that private initiative had succeeded where 
government initiative could not. In 1862, the surveyor of San Joaquin County 
explained the chief reason for toll road success: "Nothing less than the 
interest men feel in their own personal investment will induce them to do 
anything for a public highway. That interest is, however, enlisted by the 
establishment of toll roads." 
</P>
<P>
 The idea of toll roads entered decline in the 1890s. That's when America began 
its ideological and public policy shift toward centralized government planning, 
known at the time as "Progressivism." The conviction was that centralized 
government power, financed by growing taxes, could achieve things that private 
association and local government could not. By 1910 nearly all toll roads had 
been taken over by government, either state or local. 
</P>
<P>
 As California boomed, state government did indeed forge impressive highway 
facilities, but at impressive costs. The basic logic of private enterprise -- 
"the interest men feel in their own personal investment" -- remains valid here 
today, as it does in socialist countries trying to convert to capitalism. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, toll roads offer not only a means of enlisting private-sector 
entrepreneurship to the field, but also a way of controlling rush-hour 
congestion. Californians would do well to rediscover their toll road heritage.

BOOK REVIEW / NOVEL; WRITER SPINS SOAP STORY INTO PURE GOLD; LIMESTONE & CLAY: 
BY LESLEY GLAISTER ; ATHENEUM $19, 185 PAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS GOODRICH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If you first encountered "Limestone & Clay" through a plot summary, you'd 
likely be disappointed. Much of it is awfully familiar: the woman who longs to 
bear a child, her jealousy of a pregnant acquaintance, her guilt about ancient 
family incidents, her anger at a lover's foolhardy, relationship-threatening 
hobby.  
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the novel's central couple seems almost stereotypical, right down to 
their metaphorical identification in the title: Simon, a geography teacher and 
cave-explorer, is limestone, while Nadia, a skilled potter, is clay. 
</P>
<P>
 Lesley Glaister is a fine writer, however, and it's soon clear that Limestone 
& Clay won't degenerate into movie-of-the-week banality. After awhile, in fact, 
you wonder how Glaister can get so much out of rather predictable material; in 
the hands of a commercial writer, the novel would approach parody. 
</P>
<P>
 That never happens here, though, for Glaister -- whose first novel, "Honor Thy 
Father," won Britain's Somerset Maugham Award -- has immense sympathy for her 
characters, even when they do silly and spiteful things. 
</P>
<P>
 Nadia is already depressed when the book begins, fallow in both her creativity 
and her body, but things get worse when she learns that Simon's old girlfriend, 
Celia, is pregnant. The pain becomes almost unbearable when Celia tells Nadia, 
punishingly, that the child is Simon's, Celia having persuaded him to act as a 
sperm donor because her husband had had a vasectomy.  
</P>
<P>
 Nadia, desperate, leaves home before Simon arrives, spending the night in a 
hotel where she ends up baby-sitting -- and miraculously nursing -- an infant. 
Simon is irritated when he discovers Nadia gone and determines to find, alone 
and at night, an uncharted passage linking two caves . . . and where his friend 
Roland died, years before, on the same quest. 
</P>
<P>
 The novel has all the makings of a two-part soap opera episode. But Glaister 
exploits the material not for effect but for illumination, showing us not 
confrontations between characters but individual, internal reactions to strife. 
</P>
<P>
 Nadia hardens herself against Simon, wanting to kill him, or even his 
gestating child: "Death seemed the only possible remedy for the anger she 
feels. Murder. The shock of absolute cold to quench the flames."  
</P>
<P>
 Simon, en route to his pioneering adventure, thinks of Nadia's skepticism 
toward his caving: "For glory, Nadia would say, a sneer in her voice, as if 
glory was a petty thing, a paper rosette to pin on your chest. There would be a 
sort of glory . . . but glory wouldn't be the main thing. Not the nub of the 
achievement. That would be personal."  
</P>
<P>
 Celia rues, if only slightly, her thoughtless cruelty toward Nadia: "It was 
reckless, like tinkering with an experiment, shoving an extra element into a 
test tube and then regretting the fizzy coloured flare." 
</P>
<P>
 Simon and Nadia endure individual crises, naturally, during the night they 
spend apart. Nadia's does not derive from her unaccountable ability to produce 
milk, however; she drinks too much, finds dealing with the baby difficult, and 
ultimately drops the child on the bathroom floor. It's a horrifying scene, 
because we know what mixed feelings Nadia now has toward children. 
</P>
<P>
 Equally horrifying is Simon's experience in the cave, where his indignation 
and pride drive him ever onward, hoping to find a way through until he is 
wedged, exhausted and in total darkness, in an impassable corridor. He falls 
into unconsciousness, inches from Roland's bleached skull. 
</P>
<P>
 If there's a flaw in "Limestone & Clay," it's the unexpectedly optimistic 
ending. The deaths for which Glaister has set the stage are narrowly averted. 
And although Simon and Nadia are both changed by events, they are nonetheless 
willing to try to pick up the pieces of their relationship. Simon quits his 
job; Nadia regains hers.  
</P>
<P>
 "Limestone & Clay" may be a bit too sanguine in the end, but it's certainly a 
good read. It's also a textbook example of the alchemy practiced by good 
writers: turning common straw into lasting, elemental matter.

JUAN CARLOS ONETTI; COMPARED TO FAULKNER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Juan Carlos Onetti, 85, the Uruguayan-born novelist described by some literary 
critics as an existentialist, who said the main themes of all his works were 
sadness, anguish and solitude. Onetti was often compared to William Faulkner, 
creating what critic Jorge Campos has called "desperate characters without 
dreams, but who are not lacking in humanity."Onetti's works have been 
translated into English, Portuguese, French, German, Dutch, Swedish, Norwegian, 
Italian, Hebrew and Japanese. One short story, "El Infierno Mas Temido" ("The 
Most Feared Hell") was made into a film in Argentina. Born in Montevideo, he 
began his career with publication of a short story in Buenos Aires' La Prensa 
newspaper in 1932. Seven years later, he wrote his first novel, "El Pozo" ("The 
Well"). Some of his best-known novels are "Tierra de Nadie" ("No Man's Land"), 
"La Vida Breve" ("The Short Life"), "El Astillero" ("The Shipyard") and 
"Dejemos Hablar al Viento" ("Let the Wind Speak"). Several of his stories take 
place in the fictional town of Santa Maria, which he developed into one of the

WILLIAM EVERSON; BEAT POET KNOWN AS BROTHER ANTONINUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MYRNA OLIVER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 William Everson, who won national attention as a Beat Generation poet of the 
1950s under his religious name Brother Antoninus, has died. He was 81. 
</P>
<P>
 Everson, who was also a master handset printer, died Friday in his rustic 
cabin north of Santa Cruz. He had suffered from Parkinson's disease for many 
years and was confined to a wheelchair. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the last book I will handset," he told the Times in 1981, discussing 
the limitations imposed by his illness. "I cannot continue printing." 
</P>
<P>
 He was referring to the 115 copies of "American Bard," a 40-page book that he 
created by reworking Walt Whitman's 1855 preface to "Leaves of Grass" from 
prose into verse form. The entire printing -- complete with woodcuts and bound 
in pigskin -- sold out immediately at $450 a copy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Altering neither words nor word order, Everson charms its (Whitman's preface) 
powerful rhythms into soaring poetry," noted a Times reviewer after Viking 
republished the book. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Whitman, Everson was a rarity in the literary world as both printer and 
writer. One of the 58 copies of his classic book of psalms printed in the 1960s 
sold at auction in 1981 for $7,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Everson, whose mother was a typesetter and father was a printer, was born with 
ink in his blood. He began printing by hand during World War II when he was 
interned in a conscientious objector camp in Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
 Brought up in Sacramento as a Christian Scientist, Everson declared himself an 
agnostic by the time he was a teen-ager. He did not embrace Catholicism until 
his second wife began going to Mass. On Christmas Eve, 1948, he had a profound 
religious experience that he said eventually prodded him into joining the 
Dominican order as a monk. 
</P>
<P>
 For more than 18 years, Everson wrote under his religious name Brother 
Antoninus. He earned national recognition in the 1950s as part of the San 
Francisco Beat group surrounding poet Kenneth Rexroth. Everson then published 
his earlier little-known work in the book "The Residual Years: Poems 1934-48, 
the Pre-Catholic Poetry of Brother Antoninus." 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a superb and powerful gathering of poems, the complete work of those 
years," wrote then Times book editor Robert Kirsch. "These poems have the 
seeking quality of a man hungering for belief and meaning. They are religious 
in the deepest sense of the word." 
</P>
<P>
 Everson's writing, always reflective of his personal struggles, was considered 
too erotic by the church. In late 1969, he dramatically stripped off his 
monastic habit and announced that he was leaving the order to marry his third 
wife, 35 years his junior. 
</P>
<P>
 Everson spent his last active years at UC Santa Cruz teaching and creating 
poetry and handset printing. His popular class, "The Birth of a Poet," 
attracted up to 300 students a quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hopefully the class is not only an introduction to poetry," he said, "but an 
introduction to themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 Educated at Cal State Fresno, Everson published his first book of poems, 
"These Are the Ravens," in 1935. His last, "Blood of the Poet," was published 
earlier this year.

MAGRANE OF OLD LEADS ANGELS, 3-1 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN WEYLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sunday's performance by Joe Magrane, a pitcher who had not thrown a complete 
game since 1990, was the kind of turnaround the Angels' top management 
envisioned when it hired Manager Marcel Lachemann.  
</P>
<P>
 Magrane, who brought an 8.51 earned-run average into the game, had a shutout 
going into the ninth inning and limited the Milwaukee Brewers to four hits as 
the Angels ended a six-game losing streak with a 3-1 victory in front of 33,581 
at Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Lachemann is becoming baseball's version of Stuart Smalley, the "caring 
nurturer" of "Saturday Night Live" fame. Even in the bad times -- and with this 
staff there have been plenty of them -- Lachemann is able to accentuate the 
positive. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe this wasn't your best outing, but doggone it, people like you."  
</P>
<P>
 Lachemann refused to take any credit for Magrane's U-turn, unless "telling him 
he's going to keep going out there helps your confidence." 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, it doesn't hurt. 
</P>
<P>
 "Confidence is a huge part of the equation, especially in the American League 
where the strike zone is geared for hitting," said Magrane, who led the 
National League with a 2.18 ERA for St. Louis in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 Magrane, who had made more than 50 starts since his last complete game, said 
Lachemann and pitching coach Chuck Hernandez helped him with his delivery, 
specifically his arm angle. 
</P>
<P>
 "Credit Chuck and Marcel with looking at films and fine-tuning my delivery," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The result was more velocity -- "this was the hardest I've seen him throw," 
catcher Jorge Fabregas said -- and more movement on his fastball. Good stuff, 
combined with a lot of first-pitch strikes, allowed Magrane to shut down the 
Brewers until the ninth, when John Jaha walked and scored on Brian Harper's 
double down the left field line. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really wanted to finish it," said Magrane, who underwent arthroscopic elbow 
surgery Feb. 8, "but the most important thing for this team was to get the win. 
</P>
<P>
 "My arm strength is starting to come around. I was able to challenge guys with 
the fastball. You feel a little inferior when the best part of your game is 
challenging guys with your fastball and you don't have it." 
</P>
<P>
 There was nothing inferior about Sunday's outing, but it was Magrane's 
off-speed pitches that seemed to baffle the Brewers. He took something off a 
pitch to strike out Darryl Hamilton with two on and two out in the fifth 
inning. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you can get your changeup over for strikes like that, you're going to be 
successful in this league," Brewer Manager Phil Garner said. "He kept us off 
balance all day." 
</P>
<P>
 Magrane also got considerable help from his defense. J.T. Snow, who was 
recalled from Vancouver Friday night, started two double plays that helped 
Magrane slip out of potential jams and Tim Salmon made a fine running catch on 
the warning track on a line drive by Greg Vaughn in the ninth and then held on 
to the ball after colliding with center fielder Chad Curtis. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels, who had 12 hits and drew four walks, left 13 runners on base. They 
had a runner on third with less than two outs three times in the first four 
innings, but were unable to score against Bob Scanlan (0-3), who was making his 
first start of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels managed to push across a run in the fifth, however, and two more in 
the sixth against Jaime Navarro, the pitcher Scanlan replaced in the starting 
rotation. 
</P>
<P>
 Walks to Curtis and Chili Davis, sandwiched around a single by Salmon, loaded 
the bases in the fifth and Jim Edmonds' ground ball into the hole that 
shortstop Jose Valentin bobbled momentarily gave the Angels a 1-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels got three hits and a walk in the sixth. Spike Owen, making a start 
at third base and batting leadoff, drove in one run with a bases-loaded single 
to right that chased Navarro. And Salmon picked up an RBI when he drew a 
bases-loaded walk from reliever Graeme Lloyd. 
</P>
<P>
 Snow has only been with the Lachemann-led Angels for a couple of days, but he 
likes what he's seen and heard. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of the guys like his approach," Snow said. "You hear nothing but 
positive stuff from him. I'm really impressed."

EWING LEADS KNICKS PAST PACERS, 94-90; NBA PLAYOFFS: CENTER'S 24 POINTS, 22 
REBOUNDS HELP NEW YORK RALLY PAST INDIANA AND EARN BERTH IN FINALS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 There was no other way for them to do it, not the New York Knick team that 
spends most of its basketball life with one foot on a ledge and the other 
dangling off the cliff. If it would be their season, then it would have to be 
their way. 
</P>
<P>
 So there they were Sunday night, down by 12 points in the third quarter of 
Game 7 of the Eastern Conference finals and facing the possibility not only of 
elimination, but elimination by losing four of the last five games to the 
underdog Indiana Pacers. Fans inside Madison Square Garden were getting nervous 
and the coach, Pat Riley, later admitted he was concerned. 
</P>
<P>
 Before it was too late -- which should be the Knicks' slogan this season -- 
they recovered. With Patrick Ewing leading the way, they scrapped for offensive 
rebounds to compensate for 41.6% shooting, used an 18-9 run to open the fourth 
quarter and defeated the Pacers, 94-90, before 19,763 to keep the roller 
coaster ride going into the NBA finals against the Houston Rockets. 
</P>
<P>
 "We thrive on being in danger, I guess," forward Anthony Mason said. "Because 
that's when we turn it up." 
</P>
<P>
 This must have all just been part of the script, because this is where most 
people predicted at the start of the season that the Knicks would be, in the 
championship series as the successor in the East to the Michael Jordan-less 
Bulls. 
</P>
<P>
 They just took the long way, complete with detours that included finishing the 
regular season 6-6 to blow home-court advantage throughout the playoffs, 
blowing a 2-0 lead against Chicago in the conference semifinals before needing 
a Game 7 at home and, finally, blowing a 2-0 advantage versus the Pacers and 
facing elimination two nights earlier in Indianapolis before needing another 
Game 7 at home. 
</P>
<P>
 And then to be down by 12 points with 4 1/2 minutes left in the third quarter? 
Better yet, down by a point with 34.5 seconds left in the game after Dale 
Davis' layup over Ewing? 
</P>
<P>
 So it wasn't the scenic route. They got there, didn't they. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm so proud and happy for our guys," Coach Pat Riley said after the Knicks 
reached the finals for the first time since 1973. "Our backs were against the 
wall, we did it in Game 6, we were down by 13 or 14 points here, and we did it. 
It was a great ride." 
</P>
<P>
 None better than in those final 34.5 seconds, when the Pacers, looking to be 
the first team to win a Game 7 on the road since 1982, went ahead, 90-89. 
</P>
<P>
 The Knicks called timeout and Ewing, after having just missed a chance to swat 
away the go-ahead basket, called for redemption. He got it, just not the way 
anyone planned. 
</P>
<P>
 John Starks got free on the right side after Ewing cleared defender Reggie 
Miller out of the way with a pick. Given an open path, Starks headed for the 
basket and an twisting layup. Everything was going according to plan so far, 
until Starks missed the twisting layup. 
</P>
<P>
 But even the bad plays were becoming good plays for the Knicks by now. Ewing 
was waiting untouched inches from the basket, timed his jump perfectly as the 
ball came over the front of the rim, and dunked the ball with both hands with 
26.9 seconds remaining for a 91-90 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 If it was fitting for the Knicks to have people chewing fingernails down to 
the second knuckle, then this, too, was symbolic. It was one of their 28 
offensive rebounds, two short of the NBA playoff record and 11 more than the 
Pacers, but it was also Ewing rising to the occasion, literally and 
figuratively. That proved to be the game-winning basket, the exclamation point 
to his line of 24 points, a playoff career-best 22 rebounds, seven assists and 
five blocks in 44 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think I've ever seen him play a better game, especially at a moment 
of truth," Riley said. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Ewing: "We were taking a lot of shots (early) from the perimeter, but we 
weren't hitting. I told coach when we were coming through the tunnel (at 
halftime) to call my play -- fist up and fist down. Get me the ball. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we were going to go down, I wanted it to be in my hands. I mean, if we 
lose, I'm going to get the blame anyway." 
</P>
<P>
 The Pacers' response to Ewing's basket was an airball from about 20 feet by 
Reggie Miller that flew out of bounds with 4.2 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
 When Miller quickly fouled Starks with a two-hand shove to the chest to stop 
the clock with 3.2 seconds remaining, Ewing, in an uncharacteristic display, 
high-fived fans seated courtside as he walked upcourt. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Knick center didn't know how good things really were -- official Mike 
Mathis ruled it a flagrant foul, a critical call because the Knicks would get 
two free throws and retain possession. 
</P>
<P>
 When Starks made one from the line, and then two more when he was fouled with 
2.8 seconds to go after the Knicks inbounded the ball again, the Knicks had 
their four-point margin of victory. And so much more.

 Downey's California: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Everyone missed the most unique thing about Al Unser winning the Indy 500 
in an auto made by Mercedes-Benz. The car came with factory air-conditioning, 
CD player, dual air bags, power sunroof, 24-hour free roadside assistance, 
adjustable power seats, beige leather interior, five-year, 50,000-mile limited 
warranty and the kind of sensational resale value you just don't see around 
Indy much any more. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Oh, and Unser leased it. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Spike Lee, sit your skinny-little, Ewing-kissing, opponent-baiting,

</P>
<P>
 -- Coach Buddy Ryan and quarterback Jim McMahon are being reunited in this 
week's episode of Buddy and Butthead. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 -- (Explanations available on request.)

buy the Kings' hockey franchise over the last few years, but I now believe that 
it is entirely possible that I have more actual money than either one of them. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Basketball Coach Mike Krzyzewski of Duke University announced today that he 
has no announcement. 
</P>
<P>
 -- You younger golfers who don't want Arnold Palmer to play in the U.S. Open, 
boy, sometimes I wish Arnie wasn't such a sweet person so that he could swing a 
set of Ping irons at your thick skulls and keep going Ping, Ping, Ping until he 
left deep, ugly, permanent divots. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Actress Halle Berry is in "The Flintstones" and is married to Atlanta 
slugger David Justice. This is a woman who knows cavemen and Brave men. 
</P>
<P>
 -- What could really help Dave is one of those Flintstone-sized bats. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Roberto-Bobby-Roberto Kelly has yet to rename himself since joining the 
Braves. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 -- It's official: U.S. soccer player Alexi Lalas is the winner of the I Look 
Like I Sell Flowers Near the Airport contest. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Tony Meola could be the best pony-tailed goalie since Manon Rheume. 
</P>

advised. 
</P>
<P>
 -- In next year's National Spelling Bee, children will be asked to spell the 
names of Spanish tennis players. 
</P>
<P>
 -- I see where the San Francisco Giants might be interested in obtaining 
Darryl Strawberry sometime soon. Yeah, this is just what Darryl needs to ease 
his stress -- a chance to play right field again in front of his adoring fans 
at Dodger and Shea Stadiums. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Dear Darryl: I have two words of advice. One of them is "American" and the 
other is "League." 
</P>
<P>
 -- News item: In amateur draft, California Angels select outfielder, 18, who

 Fred Claire sat quietly in the clubhouse holding a cold drink, perhaps to not 
only cool him during a hot day, but also to prepare him for the heat ahead 
after his bullpen had blown another game. 
</P>
<P>
 That comfortable lead that Mike Piazza's three-run homer and four runs batted 
in had given the Dodgers evaporated in the late innings Sunday, and this time 
the bullpen didn't wait until the ninth to lose it. Through the mistakes and 
graciousness of three relievers, the Atlanta Braves scored four runs in the 
eighth inning and won, 6-5, to sweep the three-game series at Fulton County 
Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 "The pen has been working together as a unit, but we haven't been pitching as 
well as we can," said Todd Worrell, in perhaps the understatement of the 
season. "It makes it tough on everyone when you are not pitching well and not 
getting key outs." 
</P>
<P>
 Worrell, called in to bail out Darren Dreifort, gave up a two-run double to 
Jeff Blauser, the only batter he faced, which put the Braves ahead to stay. 
</P>
<P>
 Dreifort had relieved left-hander Al Osuna after Osuna had walked left-handed 
batter David Justice to lead off the inning. But Dreifort, who hadn't pitched 
in six days, fared worse. A walk and three hits later, the Braves had narrowed 
the gap to 5-4 and had the winning and tying runs on base awaiting Worrell. 
</P>
<P>
 "He (Dreifort) is keeping the ball on the ground, and that is what he is 
supposed to do," Manager Tom Lasorda said. "Tomorrow (the opposition) may hit 
three ground balls right at somebody, today they didn't." 
</P>
<P>
 Dreifort, 0-4 with a 5.27 earned run average and six saves, gave up three 
hits, including two ground balls and a line drive single. 
</P>
<P>
 One of those grounders, a single down the first base line by Dave Gallagher, 
bounced off of umpire Eric Gregg, but it was ruled fair and scored Terry 
Pendleton for the second run of the inning. Roberto Kelly followed with a 
single to right field. 
</P>
<P>
 "If that's where he was trying to hit it, he did a good job," Dreifort said.  
</P>
<P>
 Claire said he plans no changes in the bullpen, saying he will stand behind 
his pitchers. But the Dodgers have blown 12 of 21 save opportunities to amass 
only nine saves, the second fewest in the league. And though the bullpen has 
accounted for 11 of the team's 29 victories, some of those have been because it 
fails to hold the lead but the Dodgers come back to win.  
</P>
<P>
 "You don't just overhaul a bullpen and I have no intentions of doing that," 
Claire said. "We do have talented people and everybody is hurting for pitching, 
that seems to be the nature of the business. We have to give them our support 
and keep believing that they are going to get the people out." 
</P>
<P>
 Claire thought he was getting a premier closer when he signed Worrell before 
the 1993 season, but Worrell, who has been injured most of his Dodger career, 
has only seven saves since joining the team. That Claire did not require 
Worrell to have a physical examination before he was signed will continue to 
stir criticism unless Worrell comes through. 
</P>
<P>
 But how long do you stick with a bullpen that has played a big part in the 
Dodgers' record of 15-13 in one-run games? 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not really contemplating anything," Claire said. "We have four very solid 
right-handers and today, left-hander (Osuna) got us out of one inning, but came 
back and walked the leadoff hitter in the eighth. You can't pitch effective 
relief and walk the first hitter. I'd rather see the guy get a base hit than a 
walk. 
</P>
<P>
 "But that is the nature of relief. You live in the ninth and you die in the 
ninth. . . . Today was a case of not getting a big hit and not getting a big 
out." 
</P>
<P>
 With a 5-2 lead in the eighth inning, the Dodgers loaded the bases with one 
out against reliever Gregg Olson, who was making his second appearance as a 
Brave.  
</P>
<P>
 Mark Wohlers (5-0) relieved Olson and got out of the jam, striking out 
pinch-hitter Henry Rodriguez before pinch-hitter Dave Hansen grounded out. 
</P>
<P>
 In the ninth, Wohlers stranded Brett Butler, who singled and stole second 
base, and Piazza, who was intentionally walked, by getting Tim Wallach to fly 
out.

COLLEGE BASEBALL WORLD SERIES; CS FULLERTON TURNS THINGS AROUND, 20-6 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LON EUBANKS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Cal State Fullerton's hitters were frustrated and embarrassed by being shut 
out on only three hits in the College World Series opener against Georgia Tech. 
</P>
<P>
 But Titan Coach Augie Garrido came up with an answer and a whole new twist for 
the baseball coaching manual Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We hit from center field toward home plate in our practice session before the 
game," Garrido said with a smile. "Maybe that's what turned our karma around." 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton scored 11 runs in a bizarre first inning Sunday night and rolled to 
a 20-6 victory over Louisiana State, sending the defending national champion 
(46-20) back to Baton Rouge with consecutive losses. The Titans (46-15) will 
play Florida State, a 12-4 loser to Georgia Tech earlier in the day, in an 
elimination game Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It sure wasn't something that we expected," Garrido said of the first inning. 
"This was a very strange game for me. Just weird. I'm just glad that I was on 
the right side of it." 
</P>
<P>
 It was the most runs the Titans had ever scored in one game in the College 
World Series. Notre Dame in 1957 and Arizona State in l984 share the World 
Series record of 23. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought it was a good game -- for four pitches," LSU Coach Skip Bertman 
said. "Then it fell apart. When you play 70 games a year, everything is going 
to happen to you, good and bad. And the good happened for Fullerton, but they 
were real good." 
</P>
<P>
 Titan second baseman Jeff Ferguson was two for three with three runs batted in 
and four runs scored, one of them on his 12th home run of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 The Titans extended their lead to 13-0 with Ferguson's two-run homer in the 
second. LSU picked up a run in the third, but Fullerton led by 14-1 after 
Jeremy Giambi's bases-empty home run in the fourth. 
</P>
<P>
 Given a 13-run led going into the fourth, Titan starter Matt Wagner gave up 
four runs on three hits and left the game. 
</P>
<P>
 The rout continued with Fullerton scoring five runs in the fourth to make the 
score 19-5. A two-run double by Jim Betzsold and a run-scoring single by Craig 
Skyberg were the key hits. 
</P>
<P>
 Reliever Dan Ricabal got the victory, his 11th of the season to go with one 
loss. It was his third victory in the postseason; he won twice in the Midwest I 
regional.

 Matt Allison, an assistant baseball coach at Cornell, was nearly run over by, 
of all things, a runaway batting cage.  
</P>
<P>
 In an April 19 game played at Penn State, a batting cage became mobile when 
nudged by wind gusts of up to 36 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't see it until it was five or six feet away," said Allison, who was in 
the first base coaching box. "I've had no formal training on how to field that 
kind of play."

ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Damn Knicks. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 They have been called uncivil, unskilled, uncreative, uncouth and unlovable, 
but what they must be called now is Eastern Conference champion. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 In the most important NBA game of his career, Patrick Ewing turned in perhaps 
his best performance. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 He justified the confidence and courage of Pat Riley, who refused to lift 
Ewing after he committed his fourth personal foul in the third quarter or after 
his fifth in the last quarter. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The Knicks needed Ewing every precious moment. A more fainthearted coach might 
have cost his team the game. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 For sure, anti-New Yorkers will unite to complain about the flagrant foul call 
that deprived the Indiana Pacers of a chance to tie or win in the closing 
moments. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 But official Mike Mathis made the right decision. Reggie Miller went for John 
Starks' body, not the ball. And don't forget that the Knicks were victims of a 
three-point shot that the replay showed didn't beat the 24-second clock. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It's a pity that the Dodger bullpen is so weak because Darren Dreifort is a 
kid in his first year of professional baseball who should be learning in the 
minors instead of being counted upon in key situations in the majors. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Among the prime benefactors of realignment are the first-place Dodgers, who 
would be in fourth place behind Atlanta, Houston and Cincinnati in the National 
League West under the old divisional setup. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Remember 1981, when there was a split season because of the strike and four 
teams in each league made the playoffs? If the players strike early enough this 
season, maybe eight teams can go. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 What made the Dodgers' double-play combination of Jose Offerman and Garey 
Ingram unique is that it consisted of players who hit home runs in their first 
major league at-bats. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Graphic of the Day: Channel 5's showing the Braves having a 85-35 record since 
acquiring Fred McGriff from the San Diego Padres. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 I kept telling anyone who would listen that the Angels' signing of Joe Magrane 
was a stroke of genius. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 You can't accuse the Dodgers, who took a catcher, of drafting for need in the 
first round. . . . 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 French Open runner-up Mary Pierce will participate in the Virginia Slims of 
L.A., Aug. 8-14 at Manhattan Beach. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 This will always be known as the French Open where Pierce defeated Steffi Graf 
in the semifinals rather than the one where Pierce lost to Arantxa Sanchez 
Vicario in the championship. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 It was also the French Open that was swept by Spaniards in the men's, women's, 
and boys' singles competition. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 NBC commentator John McEnroe said he would like to see a major tournament 
played indoors, where weather conditions would never be a factor. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The nation's greatest jockey colony will be out in full force at 6:30 tonight 
at the L.A. Equestrian Center for team penning rodeo exhibitions and a hoedown 
that will benefit the Don MacBeth Memorial Jockey Fund. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The Amateur Athletic Foundation of Los Angeles' minority coach leadership 
program will offer free training to aspiring soccer coaches June 20-24 and June 
27-July 1 at Will Rogers Park and to swimming coaches July 5-22 at Dorsey High. 
Those interested should call 213-730-9632. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Riddick Bowe might be the most talented heavyweight around, but his career is 
getting bogged down. First, the loss of his title to Evander Holyfield, then a 
cut eye in training, and now a bad back. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The New York Ranger-Vancouver championship series means the Stanley Cup will 
be engraved with the name of a Russian for the first time -- Alexei Kovalev, 
Sergei Nechinov and Sergei Zubov of the Rangers or Pavel Bure of the Canucks. . 
. . 
</P>
<P>
 Bure's high-sticking penalty that caused his ejection in the first period 
Saturday might have turned the series around, not unlike the measurement of 
Marty McSorley's illegal stick in Game 2 of the King-Montreal series last year. 
. . . 
</P>
<P>
 The Kings lost four in a row after winning the opening game on the road and it 
won't surprise me if the same thing happens to the Canucks.

STANLEY CUP FINALS; TOUGH APPROACH BRINGS OUT BEST IN LEETCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HELENE ELLIOTT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The first couple of times New York Ranger Coach Mike Keenan told him to pay 
more attention to defense, Brian Leetch listened but didn't change his style. 
</P>
<P>
 Keenan didn't tell him again. He didn't care that Leetch had won the Norris 
Trophy in 1992 and was the engine of the Rangers' power play. The next time 
Leetch made a low-percentage play, Keenan benched him. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the beginning of the year, I was accustomed to being a big part of the 
team's offense and having to create things quite a bit," Leetch said. "Even 
though I was taking risks, I thought that was a big part of my responsibility, 
to do my best defensively and try to help out offensively. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mike continued to remind me he wanted me to play defense first and help out 
when the chances were there, and I realized that, but there are times during 
games you feel good and try to force things. He doesn't give you many 
opportunities after he's talked to you. He doesn't keep telling you, he shows 
you. Once you're able to do that on your own and keep the game simple, he gave 
me more ice time than any coach I've played for." 
</P>
<P>
 Leetch didn't appreciate Keenan's method, but he acknowledges Keenan has made 
him a better player than he was two years ago, when he scored a career-high 102 
points. Between Keenan's goading and his own resolve to rebound from a broken 
ankle he suffered last March, Leetch has become dominant in the playoffs. His 
performance is a major reason the Rangers take a 2-1 lead into Game 4 of the 
Stanley Cup finals Tuesday at the Pacific Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never seen a defenseman move on his feet like Brian Leetch," said 
teammate Glenn Anderson, who included onetime Edmonton teammate Paul Coffey in 
that statement. "Cof was more of a glider, a power strider. Brian can change 
directions like (forwards Pavel) Bure, (Sergei) Fedorov (and Alexei) Kovalev. 
He can turn on a dime and go in the other direction just as fast, and I've yet 
to see a defenseman do that." 
</P>
<P>
 With two goals in the Rangers' 5-1 victory Saturday, Leetch moved into a tie 
for the playoff scoring lead, with 28 points in 19 games. He has scored or 
assisted on 11 of the Rangers' 17 power-play goals and leads all players with a 
plus-23 defensive rating. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never went in and talked to him (about being benched). I've always tried to 
go out and lead by example and let my play do the talking," said Leetch, who 
was born in Corpus Christi, Tex., but grew up in Connecticut.  
</P>
<P>
 His first goal Saturday was a lucky flip shot, he said, but his second, which 
gave the Rangers a 3-1 lead, was a thoroughly intelligent play. Seeing Kirk 
McLean had left a long rebound on Esa Tikkanen's shot, Leetch charged the net 
and drew McLean down before slicing a backhander over the helpless goalie. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's entered the level of the Coffeys and the (Bobby) Orrs and the (Denis) 
Potvins," teammate Mark Messier said. 
</P>
<P>
 Said his defense partner, Jeff Beukeboom: "He always had great offensive 
skills, but now, defensively, his skills are almost on par with his offensive 
skills." 
</P>
<P>
 At 5-11 and 195 pounds, Leetch doesn't pound people, but his ability to read 
plays allows him to anticipate passes and short-circuit opponents' offensive 
drives. His speed makes the Rangers' transition game fearsome. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were aware of his offensive skills because he kept showing it and his 
numbers prove it, but he's clearly much better in reading the play and 
defending than I expected him to be," Canuck Coach Pat Quinn said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Keenan: "A coach doesn't have to push an athlete of that ability in order 
to coach him. They have to decide themselves, through their intrinsic values, 
how much they want to achieve and the level of performance they want to play 
at. He wants to be one of the best defensemen in the league." 
</P>
<P>
 He also wants to be better. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm playing smarter, realizing when to go offensively and when not to," he 
said. "Mike Keenan has a lot to do with that, obviously . . . I always tried to 
work hard defensively. Being in the league six years has helped in learning the 
position and staying focused for a longer period. For the future (his goal is) 
trying to continue that on a consistent basis more and more."

AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP; RED SOX SWEPT UP BY CANSECO IN FENWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jose Canseco blew out his arm in a disastrous relief pitching appearance in 
Boston last season. He returned to Fenway Park on Friday batting .275 with 11 
home runs and 42 runs batted in. 
</P>
<P>
 After the Texas Rangers completed their first sweep in Boston in 10 years with 
a 10-7 victory on Sunday, Canseco left batting .307 with 15 homers and 52 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
 His fourth homer in the three-game series, a three-run shot in the 10th 
inning, was the difference Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "When a power hitter gets hot, he's dangerous," said Canseco, who went 10 for 
13 in the three games with 10 RBIs and 10 runs scored. "You've got to love it 
here. You've got to love it if you're a right-handed power hitter. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really difficult to pitch to two hitters when you've got the three-four 
hitters that are so darn hot." 
</P>
<P>
 Will Clark, who hits behind Canseco in the cleanup spot, went nine for 15 with 
eight RBIs in the series. 
</P>
<P>
 When Canseco was called out on strikes in the first inning Sunday, it ended a 
string of 10 consecutive times he had reached base -- seven hits, two walks and 
hit by a pitch. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rangers as a team enjoyed a great weekend, too. They collected 45 hits and 
outscored Boston, 33-13. 
</P>
<P>
 The Red Sox rallied from a 6-2 eight-inning deficit to send the game to extra 
innings, with Wes Chamberlain, acquired from Philadelphia May 31, belting a 
game-tying two-run homer in the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
 Kansas City 3, New York 1 -- Kevin Appier allowed one run and six hits over 7 
2/3 innings as the Royals completed a three-game sweep at New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Appier (5-5) has a career record of 5-1 against the Yankees. He is 2-0 in his 
three starts in New York, having allowed 13 hits and four runs in 22 2/3 
innings. 
</P>
<P>
 The Royals' three-game sweep was their first in New York since 1978. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul O'Neill, who was two for four, drove in the Yankees' lone run with a 
single in the sixth. O'Neill, who is hitting .430, has six hits in his last 
nine at-bats after breaking an 0-for-14 slump with an eighth-inning single 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Detroit 5, Minnesota 3 -- The ball continued to fly out of Tiger Stadium but 
the run production decreased, as six home runs produced only eight runs. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tigers and Twins combined for 45 runs and 65 hits in the first two games 
of the series -- including a 21-7 Minnesota victory Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Toronto 5, Seattle 4 -- Devon White and Paul Molitor hit homers in the first 
inning at Seattle to help Dave Stewart beat the Mariners for the 20th time in 
his career. 
</P>
<P>
 Stewart (4-4) improved to 20-6 in his career against the Mariners, including 
2-0 this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Baltimore 8, Chicago 5 -- Cal Ripken's RBI single brought in the go-ahead run 
in the four-run seventh inning for the Orioles at Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
 Julio Franco had two RBIs for the White Sox and now has a major-league leading 
58. Toronto's Joe Carter has 57. 
</P>
<P>
 Cleveland 8, Oakland 1 -- Albert Belle drove in four runs and Eddie Murray had 
three RBIs at Oakland, and the Indians, who got 15 hits, extended their winning

NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP; PORTUGAL'S DAY A BIG HIT WITH GIANTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The San Francisco Giants, losers of five in a row, were looking for a hot bat. 
And they found it in the No. 9 position. 
</P>
<P>
 Pitcher Mark Portugal had three hits and limited the Cardinals to five in 
eight innings and the Giants won, 10-3, at St. Louis on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Portugal had a run-scoring single in the first, another single in the third 
and a double in the fifth before lining out in the seventh. 
</P>
<P>
 "He hit a bullet that last time," Giant Manager Dusty Baker said. "Those are 
some of the best four at-bats I've seen from anybody, hitter or pitcher." 
</P>
<P>
 Portugal is 11 for 29 (.379) with five runs batted in. 
</P>
<P>
 "I try to take (hitting) seriously," Portugal said. "They walked the No. 8 
hitter to get to me, and you can go out there and help yourself if you just 
take a little pride and concentrate when you're hitting." 
</P>
<P>
 Matt Williams hit his 20th homer and had three RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
 The Giants entered the game with a major league-low .239 average and had 
scored only two runs in the first two games of the series. They took out their 
frustration on Rick Sutcliffe with six runs in the first inning. Sutcliffe 
(2-2) was coming off his best outing -- 7 2/3 shutout innings against the 
Dodgers on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Giants had a season-high 17 hits. 
</P>
<P>
 Cincinnati 9, New York 6 -- Deion Sanders' daring baserunning tied the score 
with two out in the ninth inning, then Jerome Walton hit a three-run homer in 
the 10th for the Reds at Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
 The Reds trailed, 6-4, in the ninth when Brian Dorsett singled with two out 
against John Franco. Sanders followed with a hard bouncer that deflected off 
shortstop Jose Vizcaino's glove, and Sanders hustled to second for a double. 
</P>
<P>
 Lenny Harris then hit a slow grounder in the hole that Vizcaino fielded but 
threw late to first as Dorsett scored. Sanders scored as catcher Todd Hundley 
bobbled first baseman David Segui's throw. 
</P>
<P>
 Pittsburgh 4, Colorado 3 -- For the second day in a row, Kevin Young hit a 
game-winning triple for the Pirates at Denver. His bases-loaded triple in the 
sixth was the key hit Saturday when the Pirates also won, 4-3. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday, Young drove in the decisive run with a triple in the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
 Montreal 10, Chicago 5 -- Pinch-hitter Freddie Benavides tripled home the 
go-ahead run in the 13th inning at Chicago and Sean Berry had a three-run homer 
as the Expos, winning their fourth in a row, handed the Cubs their sixth 
consecutive loss. 
</P>
<P>
 All six losses have been at Wrigley Field, where the Cubs dropped to 9-20. 
They started the season 0-12 at home. 
</P>
<P>
 Houston 4, Philadelphia 2 -- Darryl Kile (4-2) gave up five hits in eight 
innings as the Astros won at Houston. 
</P>
<P>
 John Hudek got three outs for his eighth save, lowering his ERA to 0.50. 
</P>
<P>
 Florida 10, San Diego 5 -- Jerry Browne's two-run double and Benito Santiago's 
three-run homer in the seventh at Miami helped the Marlins complete a 
three-game sweep of the Padres. 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Hammond and Andy Ashby, who entered the game with two of the NL's lowest 
ERAs, both gave up five runs. Florida's Hammond lasted 6 2/3 innings, and Ashby 
only 4 1/3, giving up a grand slam to Kurt Abbott.

BASEBALL / DAILY REPORT; ANGELS; FARRELL KEEPING HIS OPTIONS OPEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN WEYLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Right-hander John Farrell knows he might not be around much longer, but he is 
trying to keep his options open. Farrell, who is 1-2 with a 9.00 ERA, will 
probably be the odd man out when Brian Anderson returns to the rotation Tuesday 
night against Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
 Farrell, who has more than five years of major league experience, would not be 
required to report to triple-A Vancouver if the Angels ask him to. 
</P>
<P>
 "My goal is to keep pitching in the big leagues, whether it's as a starter or 
a reliever," he said. "If they want me to go down, I'd have to clear waivers, 
so that may present some other options. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now, I'd have to say that I'd be inclined not to go back to the minors, 
but I'll wait to make a decision." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Dalesandro, recalled from Vancouver when Damion Easley was put on the 
disabled list Saturday night, arrived in the Angel clubhouse Sunday with a 
weary smile. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got less than four hours' sleep, but sleep is the last thing on my mind," 
he said. "I just want to help the team and hopefully I'll be here longer than 
just a few days." 
</P>
<P>
 Dalesandro batted .317 with 31 RBIs in 51 games at Vancouver. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been swinging the bat pretty well, but I didn't think much about the 
situation up here and I think that helped me," he said. "I was able to stay 
focused." 
</P>
<P>
 Dalesandro, who played at all three minor league levels in 1993, has had 
enough to think about since becoming almost a full-time catcher. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm more comfortable at the corners, either first or third, but I'm learning 
more about catching every day," he said. "I've got a long way to go, but I'm 
getting better at handling pitchers and calling a game." 
</P>
<P>
 Dalesandro says right-hander Russ Springer, who was 0-2 with a 14.34 ERA 
during the spring, has made a complete about face recently. Springer is 6-4 
with a 3.23 ERA in 11 starts for the Canadians. 
</P>
<P>
 "His velocity is great and he's throwing his curve for strikes," Dalesandro 
said. "He's gone seven or more innings in his last five or six starts. The last 
time I caught him, he was really throwing the ball well." JOHN WEYLER

 Chris Sabo, upset at his reserve role, said he has asked to be traded by the

"There's no hard feelings. . . . I did not sign here to be a reserve." Sabo has

TENNIS / ELLIOTT ALMOND; IMAGE PROBLEM ISN'T HELPED BY COURIER'S BOORISH 
ATTITUDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLIOTT ALMOND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Almost anyone who has swung a racket during the French Open the last two weeks 
has been asked about the state of their sport. The questions have been 
legitimate, what with the women's game missing Monica Seles and any element of 
drama. Even Mary Pierce's upset at Roland Garros does little to ensure the 
game's resurrection until she proves her mettle. 
</P>
<P>
 The image of the men's game also is suffering, although this Grand Slam 
tournament has given us some new faces to talk about. 
</P>
<P>
 Which is nice. Because, really, it is becoming tiresome listening to some of 
the old hands. 
</P>
<P>
 In this category, Jim Courier, the avowed new man, ranks No. 1. No one can 
criticize his powerful, determined game. His work ethic is unsurpassed. 
</P>
<P>
 But his boorish behavior off the court only hurts the game that has given him 
so much. He claims to have brought a "sunny new disposition" to Paris this 
year, but mostly he has been his taciturn self. 
</P>
<P>
 After winning his second French Open two years ago, Courier was asked by a 
young local radio reporter to speak French for her audience. After all, Courier 
had thanked the Center Court crowd for their support in French, and prides 
himself on his language skill. But he was defiant in refusing her simple 
request. 
</P>
<P>
 He acts as if the world is against him, and such an attitude does little to 
enhance the game that could use some help. He has been telling us that he has 
changed, and is much happier because of it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I decided I was tired of being the angry young man," said Courier, a 
semifinal loser to Sergi Bruguera of Spain. "I've let the mask down and shown 
the real person. This is the way I am." 
</P>
<P>
 But it seems he is struggling with this nice-guy image as caustic remarks 
continue to lace his interview sessions. And that's too bad for a game that is 
trying to sustain interest and develop personalities. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Andrei Medvedev of the Ukraine is a rising star who is proof that for all of 
the game's flaws, tennis remains a fun and intriguing sport. He wears a 
mischievous smile that endears him to younger fans. He actually looks as if he 
enjoys himself during matches. 
</P>
<P>
 But the 20-year-old must be careful not to follow many of the big-name stars, 
who seem to have let fame and fortune go to their heads. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know all the guys. Every guy has charisma and personality, and you just 
don't look at it," he chided reporters last week. 
</P>
<P>
 "The people are blaming us for not smiling and for not showing character. But, 
unfortunately, the sport is not as easy as it looks. Everyone serves more than 
180 kilometers (about 108 m.p.h.) an hour . . . just once try to return that 
serve, you will understand why we are not smiling. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would like to make jokes. (But) you don't have to take me as a clown. I am 
not here to entertain you. If I lose, I will not try to make a tragedy or act 
like a loser. I would actually try to (play so) people would still enjoy the 
game. For them, it is a show, I understand that. For us, it's a job." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Michael Chang, who has never been able to repeat the magic that helped him win 
the 1989 French Open at 17, has, along with top-ranked Pete Sampras, brought a 
dignity to the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Chang's perspective on tennis' problems: 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems like team sports, you take each localized city and they are able to 
relate to a team. Tennis is so much an individual sport. Tennis has been 
brought up in such a way that it is so much a gentleman's sport that it is very 
difficult to get away from traditional ideas and traditional ways of presenting 
a match." 
</P>
<P>
 He suggested that promoters consider some of the changes that have made the 
NBA an international success. 
</P>
<P>
 "The way they market it is so much of an energy type of thing, they are 
showing the dunks and stuff like that," Chang said. 
</P>
<P>
 Chang also noted that although tennis is losing some interest in the United 
States, it is booming in Asia, where he is a fan favorite. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The quality of tennis players is as high as ever. A Courier-Sampras match at a 
Grand Slam tournament has the potential to be as exciting as Borg-McEnroe. 
Perhaps tennis simply is going through a temporary slump, as many officials 
claim. 
</P>
<P>
 Not surprisingly, they have lost their sense of responsibility. Where are the 
ambassadors to replace the Arthur Ashes and Ken Rosewalls? 
</P>
<P>
 If Courier thinks a little proclamation that he has changed is the answer, he 
is more gullible than his adoring public. He and his ilk are going to have to 
work as hard off the court as they do on it to change tennis' image. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps Andre Agassi was right all along: Image is everything. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Courier, who has played in 22 Grand Slam tournaments, was asked to rate the 
sites. 
</P>
<P>
 Wimbledon is No. 1 in his book, the French Open No. 2, followed by the 
Australian Open and the U.S. Open, which he called a distant fourth. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I'd rate Court 1 at Wimbledon over the U.S. Open Center Court, 
actually," Courier said  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Brooke Shields had a tennis connection long before she started dating Agassi. 
Frank Shields, her grandfather, qualified for Wimbledon in the 1920s, but was 
unable to compete because of an injury. 
</P>
<P>
 He did play in the first round of the U.S. Open but lost. Tennis Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Boris Becker is scheduled to make a rare Southland appearance in the Los 
Angeles Open Aug. 1-7 at UCLA. Becker won titles at Indian Wells in 1987 and 
'88, but has never played in the L.A. Open. Also scheduled to compete are Andre 
Agassi, who won the tournament in 1988, and Michael Chang, a finalist in three 
of the last five years. . . . Three "opportunity" tournaments -- July 6-10 at 
Rancho San Clemente Tennis & Fitness Club, July 13-17 at the Beverly Hills 
Tennis Club and July 20-24 at Rancho Valencia Resort -- will send their winners 
to a qualifying tournament for the Toshiba Classic, a WTA event Aug. 1-7 at La 
Costa.

GOLF ROUNDUP; DANIEL'S 20-UNDER EFFORT TIES RECORD, WINS TOURNAMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press

<TEXT>
<P>
 There was little doubt Beth Daniel would win the LPGA Oldsmobile Classic in 
East Lansing, Mich. The main question was: How many records would she break? 
</P>
<P>
 Daniel closed with a four-under 68 Sunday, and her 20-under total tied the 
LPGA record for 72 holes by Nancy Lopez in the 1985 Henredon Classic at the 
Willow Creek Golf Club in High Point, N.C., also a par-72 course. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the best that I've played," Daniel said. 
</P>
<P>
 Daniel's total of 268 was four strokes better than Lisa Kiggens and five 
better than Amy Benz, neither of whom has ever won. 
</P>
<P>
 Daniel also left other marks, breaking the tournament record of 276 by Barb 
Mucha in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Daniel had a 63 in the second round, besting Deb Richard's tournament record 
by a stroke. Her 36-hole 130 and 54-hole 200 totals also set tournament marks. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Forget the other 71 holes. Mark Brooks won The Kemper Open on the sixth hole 
of the final round, when Bobby Wadkins lost his ball and a chance to win his 
first tournament in 20 years on the PGA Tour. 
</P>
<P>
 Brooks won with a 72-hole total of 271, finishing with a two-under 69 that 
gave him a three-stroke victory over Wadkins and D.A. Weibring in Potomac, Md. 
</P>
<P>
 Wadkins led Brooks by one stroke after five holes, but his triple-bogey on No. 
6 doomed him. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Dent added some deft putting to his long driving and overpowered the back 
nine on the way to a two-stroke seniors victory at the Bruno's Memorial Classic 
in Birmingham, Ala. 
</P>
<P>
 Dent birdied Nos. 10, 11, 13, 15 and 16 for a 31 over the final nine holes, 
finishing with a five-under 67 and a 15-under 201 total. Second-round leader 
Bob Charles shot a 71 and tied for second at 203 with Larry Gilbert and Kermit 
Zarley.

 Al Unser Jr. won his third consecutive Indy-car race, holding off teammate 
Emerson Fittipaldi in the Miller Genuine Draft 200 at Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
 Teammate Paul Tracy finished two laps behind in third to give car owner Roger 
Penske a sweep in the 200-lap event that was shortened eight laps because of 
rain. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the fourth consecutive victory for the Penske team. 
</P>
<P>
 A week earlier, Unser and Fittipaldi dominated the Indy 500 with much of the 
credit going to the super-powered Mercedes engines built specifically for that 
event.

multiple leg fractures, was airlifted to an Ensenada hospital.

 Also, Carl Renezeder, who finished second in his class and fifth overall, was 
disqualified after allegedly backing over a spectator, Adrian Flores of 
Tijuana, while trying to get unstuck from a sand pit. Flores was also 
hospitalized and was in satisfactory condition.

 Dave Ashley of San Bernardino, who covered the 465.3 miles from Ensenada to 
Santo Tomas in 10 hours 28 minutes 38 seconds (averaging 44.411 m.p.h.), was

 Berdusco, who entered in the 62nd minute, sent the crowd of 51,930 at Edmonton 
into a frenzy when he hammered a shot high into the left corner over goalie 
Claudio Taffarel. 
</P>
<P>
 The goal came after Romario scored in the 45th minute. The Brazilian star took 
a pass at the top of the penalty box, snaked his way through three defenders 
before drilling a low, hard shot to the left corner behind goalie Craig 
Forrest. 
</P>
<P>
 The game was one of five exhibitions Canada is playing against World Cup-bound 
teams. Brazil, a three-time champion, will open World Cup play June 20 against 
Russia at Stanford Stadium in Palo Alto. Canada failed to qualify.

 Herman Gaviria and Freddy Rincon scored in the second half on setups off free 
kicks as Colombia defeated Greece, 2-0, in a World Cup tuneup for both teams at 
Giants Stadium in East Rutherford, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only was the exhibition a tuneup for the teams, it was the first test of 
the stadium's new grass field, which was installed over an artificial surface 
in May. 
</P>
<P>
 And from all indications, the field held up well. The ball appeared to bounce 
smoothly, the footing was good and the grass did not come up as players were 
tackled, a major concern with seven World Cup games scheduled here in June and 
July. 
</P>
<P>
 Colombia, which will be playing in its third World Cup and second in a row, 
dominated the game before a crowd of 73,511, most of whom wore yellow and 
rooted for the South American team.

play Mexico in its opening game in Washington on June 19. 
</P>
<P>
 Sweden will face Romania in its final tuneup in San Diego on June 12 before 
taking on Cameroon in the World Cup opener seven days later at the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 The Swedes, who lost their first Nordic Cup match, 1-0, to European champion 
Denmark, struggled in the first half against a Norwegian defense that conceded 
only one goal in four previous exhibitions.

HYDROPLANE RACING; TATE WINS GOLD CUP; HANAUER RELEASED FROM HOSPITAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHAV GLICK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The garish purple and yellow Smokin' Joe's unlimited hydroplane, with hometown 
driver Mark Tate in the cockpit, won the APBA Gold Cup on the Detroit River on 
Sunday in a race without nine-time champion Chip Hanauer. 
</P>
<P>
 With an estimated 350,000 spectators lining the shores of Belle Isle and 
downtown Detroit, Tate had a perfect day in the Steve Woomer-owned boat, which 
is powered by a Lycoming helicopter turbine engine. He swept four heats and the 
five-lap Gold Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 Hanauer suffered fractures of the lower back and groin injuries in an accident 
Saturday when the escape hatch blew open on the bottom of the Miss Budweiser 
boat at 130 m.p.h. and water slammed into the cockpit. 
</P>
<P>
 "It felt like someone hit me in the back with a sledge hammer," Hanauer said 
Sunday after being released from the hospital. It was similar to an accident 
that occurred last year shortly after Hanauer had won a race in Madison, Ind. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was much worse than Madison," Hanauer said. At that time, he said it 
felt like getting a 150 m.p.h. kick in the groin. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a shame Chip wasn't out there because he's a legend in our sport and I 
enjoy racing against him, but in no way does his not being there taint our 
win," Tate said. "I've been coming to the Detroit River since I was a kid 
growing up and watching Bill Cantrell and later Bill Muncey drive in the Gold 
Cup, so it means a lot to me to win here." 
</P>
<P>
 Tate, who set the Detroit River qualifying record of 170.087 m.p.h. last year, 
averaged 145.260 for the 12.5-mile Gold Cup and also had the fastest lap of 
151.280. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Tate's second Gold Cup victory -- both without Hanauer in the race. 
Tate won in 1991 for Woomer in the same boat when it was the Winston Eagle, a 
year in which Hanauer sat out the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Nate Brown, who was Tate's crew chief in 1991, finished second in The Tide. It 
was the fifth consecutive year the boat had finished second in the Gold Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 Miss Budweiser, with Mike Hanson substituting for Hanauer, was credited with 
third place after Miss Exide was docked a lap for cutting off Pico's American 
Dream in the first turn. 
</P>
<P>
 Pico's American Dream, driven by Dave Villwock, was expected to be Smokin' 
Joe's toughest competition in the finals, but the boat was swamped when it was 
cut off. 
</P>
<P>
 Hanauer, who returned to the river in time to coach Hanson, is not expected to 
race Sunday in the Texas Hydrofest in Lewisville, Tex., but hopes to be healed 
in time for the June 26 Pontiac Thunder on the Ohio in Evansville, Ind. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now, it's hard to imagine getting in the boat, but hopefully I'll feel 
good enough in a couple of weeks," Hanauer said. He is the defending series 
champion and has won the national championship seven times.

 MALL GROWTH: Attention, shop-aholics: the Valencia Town Center is about to 
double in size. Its developer, Newhall Land and Farming Co., is looking for 
more department stores to anchor additional store corridors. The mall features 
110 stores and is expected to grow to about 200 within two or three years.

 MONEY TALKS: Heidi Armer of Woodland Hills swears she wasn't stealing an idea 
from Caltrans when she offered the contractor working on her quake-damaged home 
an incentive to finish early . . . If he finished the job in three weeks, she 
promised him a $500 bonus, four weeks and he'd get $250 extra. "What 
contractors are doing right now is spreading themselves so thin," Armer said. 
And if he finished late? He agreed to forfeit $250 for the first week -- $500 
if he ran two weeks over schedule.

 QUAKE U.: The earthquake threw many of them out of their beds. They suffered 
damaged labs, portable toilets and classes in trailers. But they endured, and 
beginning today, CSUN's most shaken-up batch of graduates ever will get their

 DOWNTOWN REBOUND?: As local merchants will tell you, the downtown areas of 
Reseda and Canoga Park could use some sprucing up. And last weekend, local 
business people got together with urban planners to brainstorm cheap but 
effective ways to restore Sherman Way between the two communities. Among the 
ideas: planting trees, patrolling parking lots at night to prevent trash 
dumping, and creating special shopping districts. (B1)

 GORILLA GRUB: Like anyone else, the gorillas at the Los Angeles Zoo like their

FRUSTRATED TITANS GET AGGRESSIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LON EUBANKS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Cal State Fullerton's hitters were frustrated and embarrassed by being shut 
out on three hits in the College World Series opener against Georgia Tech. 
</P>
<P>
 But Titan Coach Augie Garrido came up with an answer and a whole new twist for 
the baseball coaching manual Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We hit from center field toward home plate in our practice session before the 
game," Garrido said with a smile. "Maybe that's what turned our karma around." 
</P>
<P>
 Instant karma certainly got the Titans going Sunday night. Fullerton scored 11 
runs in a bizarre first inning and rolled on to 20-6 victory over Louisiana 
State, sending the defending national-champion Tigers (46-20) back to Baton 
Rouge with consecutive losses. The Titans (46-15) meet Florida State, a 12-4 
loser to Georgia Tech earlier in the day, in an elimination game Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the kind of game that made Garrido just roll his eyes and ask: "Where 
the hell did that come from? It sure wasn't something that we expected. This 
was a very strange game for me. Just weird. I'm just glad that I was on the 
right side of it." 
</P>
<P>
 It was the most runs the Titans had ever scored in one game in the College 
World Series. Notre Dame in 1957 and Arizona State in l984 share the record for 
most runs scored in a Series game at 23. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought it was a good game for four pitches," LSU Coach Skip Bertman said. 
"Then it fell apart. When you play 70 games a year everything is going to 
happen to you, good and bad. And the good happened for Fullerton, but they were 
real good." 
</P>
<P>
 Second baseman Jeff Ferguson was two for three with three runs batted in and 
four runs scored, one of them on his 12th home run of the season. He moved into 
the leadoff spot because Dante Powell remained hobbled. Garrido had planned to 
use Powell as the designated hitter, but changed the lineup at the last minute, 
putting Powell back in center field and putting Sal Mancuso back in the lineup 
as the designated hitter. And Mancuso wound up getting two hits in the first 
inning. 
</P>
<P>
 Ferguson opened with a double. Then bunts by Mark Kotsay and Bret Hemphill 
that LSU misplayed got the Titans rolling with one run in and the bases loaded. 
Mancuso promptly singled in another run and then the roof fell in.  
</P>
<P>
 Adam Millan walked, forcing in another run. Jason Gill's infield out scored 
another, and more shoddy defensive play helped Fullerton. Jack Jones bunted and 
LSU appeared to have an out at the plate, but the Tiger catcher lost control of 
the ball, giving the Titans a 6-0 command. Kotsay, batting for the second time 
in the inning, walked on four pitches, forcing in another run and building the 
lead to 7-0. Bertman finally got pitcher Brett Laxton out of the game. 
</P>
<P>
 The next Tiger pitcher, Jeremy Tyson, didn't fare much better. He struck out 
Powell for his second out, but the Titans put four more runs on the board 
before LSU could stop the bleeding. Hemphill singled in two more runs and 
Mancuso had a one-run single. Another error on Millan's ground ball added the 
final run. 
</P>
<P>
 The Titans built their lead to 13-0 with Ferguson's two-run homer in the 
second. LSU picked up a run in the third, but Fullerton led, 14-1, after Jeremy 
Giambi's bases-empty home run in the fourth. 
</P>
<P>
 Given a 13-run led going into the fourth, Titan starter Matt Wagner got into 
trouble and gave up four runs on three hits and left the game. Dan Ricabal came 
on in relief to get the final out. 
</P>
<P>
 The rout continued with Fullerton scoring five runs in the fourth to make it 
19-5. A two-run double by Jim Betzsold and a one-run single by Craig Skyberg 
were the big hits for the Titans.

 My wife and I drove up to Bakersfield on a rainy Saturday to attend the 60th 
anniversary of her graduation from Washington School in East Bakersfield. 
</P>
<P>
 Since I do not drive, Denise was at the wheel of her 10-year-old car, a lemon 
she professes to love. She is not a reckless driver. Her reflexes are 
excellent. But she is impatient, so most of the trip was a thrill. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ridge Route was beautiful. The mountains were dark green with scrub and 
spotted with yellow patches of Scotch broom. Before the Palmdale cutoff we 
pulled up behind a miles-long traffic jam, which slowed her down considerably. 
The highway was cluttered with heavy equipment repairing earthquake damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the picnic was to start at 11 o'clock, we had left home at 9, figuring 
two hours should do it. However, when we got to Bakersfield, my wife got turned 
around trying to find the park where the picnic was to be, and we lost another 
20 minutes going in the wrong direction. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're going south," I told her. 
</P>
<P>
 "No," she said, "I'm going north." 
</P>
<P>
 We were on a street whose signs identified it as South Real Road. I noted that 
the block numbers were becoming larger, which meant we were going south. When I 
finally convinced her of this, she explained that she must have been turned 
around by an off-ramp that apparently made a complete circle. We were about 40 
minutes late when we found the old grads gathered at a picnic table in the 
park. 
</P>
<P>
 There were about 20 of her classmates and their spouses. "This must be boring 
for you," one of the men said. "No," I said, "I like being around younger 
people." (I am four years older than my wife.) 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 There were squeals of recognition and hugs when we arrived. The women were 
just beginning to unload their picnic baskets. Fortunately, my wife's sister, 
Suzie, who was in an earlier class but had come to be with her, had brought 
some Bud Lite, apparently just for me. I had two cans, which considerably 
raised my spirits. 
</P>
<P>
 The sky had turned gray and threatening. Bakersfield weather can be surly. I 
felt tiny raindrops on my cheeks. But we had dressed warmly and were 
undismayed. 
</P>
<P>
 One of Denise's classmates, Iva Mae Dudley, had brought a photo album and 
opened it to a large class picture. I picked my wife out in an instant. Her 
dark hair was cut in a Buster Brown bob. Her eyes were mischievous. Her smile 
was precociously sensual. What a fifth-grader! That was seven years before we 
met. 
</P>
<P>
 Denise pointed to one of the boys in the class and said, "I was sweet on him." 
Apparently, though, nothing came of it. He didn't look like much to me. Anyway, 
I don't see how he could have resisted the little girl with the Buster Brown 
bob. I was glad he had left her for me. 
</P>
<P>
 If he'd had my eye, she would have been taken. I met her on a blind date 
arranged by our mutual friend Cliff Gill. While I stayed in my car, he went to 
the door of her little house in Nile Street in East Bakersfield to get her, and 
when she walked out in the porch light I knew instantly that she was the girl 
for me. She was going to be my wife. It probably took her a little longer to 
get the idea. 
</P>
<P>
 It was easy. She was a senior at Kern County Union High School, quite 
unsophisticated, and I was a hot-shot sports reporter for the Bakersfield 
Californian. I simply dazzled her with worldly charm. 
</P>
<P>
 She knew nothing about sports. Once at a football game, she overheard another 
girl say, "They're puttin' in 11 new men!" She said to me: "You think I'm dumb 
-- that girl doesn't even know there are only nine men on a football team." How 
could you not love a girl like that? 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 It had begun to sprinkle and the dark sky promised more. Having no shelter, we 
began to pack up. We said our goodbys and started home. By the time we reached 
Gorman, the sky had erupted. It was raining hard. 
</P>
<P>
 I had read in the paper that Gorman was for sale for $13.6 million. We passed 
through it in less than a minute -- three gas stations and a restaurant, and I 
decided I didn't want to buy it. 
</P>
<P>
 It rained hard most of the way home. I wondered at our common sense in 
undertaking such a journey in that kind of weather. 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, well, my own 60th anniversary is coming up in July (Belmont High School, 
Class of '34) and I'll want the kid with the Buster Brown haircut to be there. 
It's going to be at our house, so, thank God, we can't get lost. (Classmates: 
Write to me for details and map.)

HOWARD ROSENBERG: TELEVISION; 'TIME': ONE MAN'S FAMILY VALUES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOWARD ROSENBERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Beware of those moralizing, self-anointed guardians of virtue who toss "family 
values" at America like rice at newlyweds. What they usually have in mind for 
the rest of us are their family values. 
</P>
<P>
 Just how they'll regard Ross McElwee's quirky, probing, endearing "family" 
film, "Time Indefinite," remains to be seen. It's the Tuesday night season 
opener for "P.O.V.," the nonfiction film series that conservatives often cite 
to bolster their fallacious argument that PBS is somewhat to the left of Fidel 
Castro. Expect that attack to resume June 14 when "P.O.V." (which stands for 
Point of View) airs "One Nation Under God," a film that justifiably smirks at 
the quackery employed by chaster-than-thou zealots seeking to exorcise the evil 
spirit of homosexuality from gays. 
</P>
<P>
 A program of a strikingly different persuasion is the two-hour "Time 
Indefinite," in which McElwee -- who boldly confesses to being heterosexual -- 
continues the self-exploration on videotape that he began with "Sherman's 
March" in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 That earlier personal journal captured McElwee's whimsically futile search for 
a steady gal. More poignant is "Time Indefinite," which wryly, but also 
movingly, monitors his family's cycles and passages, the sad along with the 
exhilarating. Although McElwee at times gets a little carried away with his 
Angst and Why-do-I-feel-the-way-I-do? self-absorption, you can't pull yourself 
away from this peephole. It's the kind of detailed film in which something as 
seemingly banal as a peek inside a sock drawer earns a certain significance. 
</P>
<P>
 It opens happily in 1987 with the 39-year-old Cambridge, Mass., bachelor 
taping a McElwee family reunion in North Carolina ("There is my sister-in-law, 
Sally") at which Ross announces his coming marriage to Marilyn Levine, a fellow 
filmmaker. His surgeon father, stepmother and everyone else are thrilled. 
They'd given up hope. 
</P>
<P>
 McElwee immediately displays his self-effacing side and his eye for absurdity, 
inserting much-earlier footage of his sister, Deedee, rowing them in a small 
boat while soberly assessing his breakup with a previous girlfriend. "Do you 
think any of it had to do with your lifestyle, the way you dress, the way you 
live? I think you should tidy up a little bit." 
</P>
<P>
 This man is a compulsive chronicler. So there, too, is his footage of an 
earlier blind date arranged for him by his close friend, Charlene Swansea, who 
playfully puts her hand over his lens to stop him from taping his date's 
arrival. No chance. "That particular blind date didn't work out," he adds, 
drolly, in a monotone voice-over. 
</P>
<P>
 A sort of real-life Max Headroom, McElwee and his camera seem to merge into a 
single unit, his head becoming the lens. This obsession with stockpiling 
everything on camera at first strikes you as the aimless accumulation of a 
video pack rat. But soon it's obvious that these tiny moments and bits of 
routine and trivia (somehow fascinating) are life layers underlying the 
epidermis. Together, they're what living is about. 
</P>
<P>
 McElwee uses his camera to sweetly brush-stroke Marilyn, capturing everything 
about her that he adores, including even "the intense way" she brushes her 
teeth. There they are together getting a marriage license. "Don't mind him," 
Marilyn tells a clerk quizzically eyeing the camera. "He sort of does this all 
the time." 
</P>
<P>
 Only occasionally does her impatience surface. "If you put the camera down," 
Marilyn tells Ross while unpacking boxes in their new home, "you could help." 
Ever relentless, though, he has his camera going when she's on her back, legs 
apart, being examined by her gynecologist, who pronounces her "all set for baby 
city." 
</P>
<P>
 And when she does get pregnant after they're married, the camera is rolling 
when she informs her parents, and when the couple goes shopping for baby gear. 
"$70 for the quilt -- really beautiful work," the saleswoman says before 
leaving. Marilyn turns to the lens, whispering: "What do you think, Ross?" 
</P>
<P>
 What Ross thinks matters not only to his wife but also to Ross, whose 
introspection intensifies when his life is rocked by a cluster of tragedies 
that bring a somberness to "Time Indefinite." The two major themes that thread 
the film -- death and continuity -- are touchingly juxtaposed, partially 
through scratchy old home movies of McElwee's parents' wedding and his 
grandmother singing vaudeville songs many years before her appearance in his 
present film as an incontinent old woman eroding in a home for the aged. And 
even as death shadows Ross' life, the McElwee family's longtime housekeeper 
celebrates her 50th wedding anniversary. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite his omnipresence behind the camera, the bearded, eggheadish-looking 
McElwee is the least-taped subject in his autobiographical film. And neither he 
nor Marilyn is as arresting as his friend, Charlene, an intriguing woman of 
almost mystical intelligence. Ross and his camera are along when she returns to 
the now-restored, lovely old house that her estranged husband, Buck, burned 
down as an act of protest, cremating himself in the process. A framed picture 
of the epic blaze hangs on a wall inside the local firehouse, and Charlene 
notes the irony. "It was the pinnacle of their life," she says, "his death." 
</P>

 The Pacific Symphony has been highly recommended by state arts advisers for a 
California Arts Council Challenge grant to support its commission of a 
symphonic-choral work by New York composer Elliott Goldenthal commemorating the 
Vietnam War. The panel, which met last week, gave the orchestra a 3+ ranking on 
a 1-4 scale. Typically all rankings of 3 and above receive funding.

POP MUSIC REVIEW; LIFE-PACKED SHOW? HE WROTE THE BOOK

<TEXT>
<P>
 There are cool things to be found in libraries, some dandy writing lodged in 
there amid the Dewey Decimal System and the bits of graffiti one sometimes 
comes across. 
</P>
<P>
 But, look though you might, you'll probably not find anything nearly so cool 
as John Hammond's performance Friday night in the outdoor courtyard of the San 
Juan Capistrano Regional Library. It was easily one of the most emotional, 
life-packed, wholly realized displays of artistry we'll hear in the county this 
year, and certainly the only one in which a Craftsman 11/16-inch, deep-well 
wrench socket played a part.  
</P>
<P>
 It isn't necessarily your fault if you haven't heard of Hammond. He's a 
bluesman, an appellation which alone is sufficient to keep him off the 
playlists of an entertainment media that disdains feeling and content. 
</P>
<P>
 Further, he came along after the generations of bluesmen who originated its 
forms, and just before the generation of white blues players who capitalized on 
the music by rocking it up through stacks of Marshall amps. While Hammond is 
held in mutual respect by the members of both generations -- indeed, his '60s 
albums provided the doorway into the blues for many a future guitar god -- he 
was never "authentic" nor ostentatious enough to get the broader respect he's 
deserved. 
</P>
<P>
 This didn't seem to be especially troubling Hammond on Friday, as he was 
otherwise busy sounding like a one-man fish fry: howling, moaning, crowing and 
pleading his songs, blowing harmonica hurricanes, stomping rhythms with his 
left foot so authoritative you'd swear he'd borrowed the appendage from John 
Lee Hooker, and driving his poor guitar like a hell-bound locomotive.  
</P>
<P>
 His blues ran the gamut, from the clearest skies to the deepest indigo, and 
his connection with the material, even overworked warhorses like "The Walking 
Blues," was stunning in its raw immediacy. Hammond performed on acoustic 
instruments, but the effect was electrifying. 
</P>
<P>
 "Man, I feel like I've just licked a wall socket!" exclaimed local blues 
player Joel Easton in the audience at the show's conclusion, and one could only 
nod in agreement. Hammond has always been a passionate performer, but after 32 
years of exhaustive touring he seems to be only entering his artistic prime, if 
the Capistrano show was any indication. 
</P>
<P>
 At 51, Hammond looks more like Peter O'Toole than most people have a right to, 
with a face that conveys every nuance of whoop and rue in the songs he sings. 
His voice is deep and sensual, rich in higher overtones, and carries echoes of 
several other singers, including Hooker, blues touchstone Robert Johnson, the 
wonderfully unintelligible Robert Pete Williams and the moody Skip James. 
</P>
<P>
 The 15 songs in his first of two shows Friday ranged from the familiar, such 
as Johnson's "Come on in My Kitchen" and Jimmy Reed's "Honest I Do," to the 
truly obscure -- for example, Hambone Willie Newburn's 1928 "Dreamy Eyed Girl," 
a slow blues in which the singer's girl informs him, "Big boy, I wouldn't miss 
you if the Good Lord told me you were dead." Hammond doesn't write his songs, 
but they most certainly become his. 
</P>
<P>
 Only two songs were from Hammond's current album, "Trouble No More," an album 
that also wasn't much represented by the form of his performance. On the disc 
he's accompanied on most tracks by the ever-excellent Little Charlie and the 
Nightcats, while Friday's show, like most of Hammond's, was a solo affair. As 
lively and empathetic a band as the Nightcats are, he sounds more complete on 
his own. 
</P>
<P>
 With his foot pounding the stage and his finger-picks raking the strings -- 
and the aforementioned Craftsman socket affixed to a pinkie for his slide work 
-- Hammond created as much ruckus as any band, while retaining a breathtaking 
intimacy. His voice, guitar work and harp playing were equally unfettered, his 
mastery of his craft evident by the way he would sometimes take his performance 
to the brink of musical chaos without losing control.  
</P>
<P>
 There might have been times when his slide was whizzing over the strings 
making jagged stops, his head tilted back, face reddening as his harmonica went 
into falsetto orbit, that one might have briefly wondered, "Is this music ?" 
Inasmuch as his playing was too captivating to allow much time for such 
musings, the answer would seem an obvious yes . 
</P>
<P>
 He has an elastic control of time in his songs. Others might sing about having 
a hellhound on their trail. Hammond plays like it: On up-tempo numbers, he 
raced around his guitar neck like notes were bodies he had to push out of his 
way to evade being caught by his fate or his baby -- blues doesn't seem to make 
much distinction between the two.  
</P>
<P>
 Conversely, on his deeper blues -- "See That My Grave is Swept Clean," "Love 
Changin' Blues," "Hard Time Killing Floor" -- time nearly stopped, with 
mournful notes left to die out in the desolate spaces between them. Scary 
stuff.  
</P>
<P>
 It likely didn't impede Hammond's pursuit of his craft that he was playing for 
an attentive, appreciative audience. His performance was part of the San Juan 
Capistrano Multicultural Performing and Visual Arts Series regularly presented 
at the library, just a swallow's throw from the mission, and they've got a good 
scene going there.  
</P>
<P>
 The library's grassy courtyard can hold some 300 people -- and did in each of 
the two shows Friday. The sound is excellent and the sight lines good except 
for behind four otherwise splendid cypress trees. No ringing cash registers or 
drink minimums, no cigarette smoke, no drunks trying to noisily hit on 
waitresses during the ballads: just a $5 ticket (the series lost its county 
funding last year, by the way), the sky above, and people listening as if music 
actually mattered. (You can call (714) 493-1752 for info on upcoming shows.) 
</P>
<P>
 It would seem to be an artist's dream, and speaking to Hammond after the show 
he said he'd been floored by the response he'd received there, particularly in 
light of his experience the night before playing to a chatty, there-to-be-seen 
crowd at Hollywood's House of Blues. That trendy new club, it should also be 
noted, lacks a book drop.

SCREENING ROOM; A STRONG WEEK FOR ALTERNATIVE FILMMAKERS

 Michael Jay Tollin's vital and thoughtful 44-minute documentary "Hardwood 
Dreams" and Kim Greene's delightful 40-minute "Sweet Potato Ride," which 
premiere Thursday at the Nuart and then screen Saturdays and Sundays at noon, 
highlight an exceptionally strong week of alternative film offerings. 
</P>
<P>
 The first, which anticipates the mini-basketball film trend of the 
forthcoming, highly praised documentary "Hoop Dreams" and feature film 
"Basketball Diaries" (based on the Jim Carroll memoirs), chronicles the senior 
year of local kids hoping to make good: five African American basketball stars 
at Inglewood's Morningside High School, all hoping to land college 
scholarships. These young men are likable, even as they are subject to terrific 
external pressures -- and most of them suffer from a woefully inadequate 
preparation for college. 
</P>
<P>
 Greene's wise, amusing and affectionate vignette, written and produced with 
Camille Tucker, centers on an adventure-filled afternoon of a bright African 
American 10-year-old (irresistible Dejuan Guy) that deftly underlines the 
importance of a strong father-son relationship. Information: (310) 478-6379.

 The exceptionally rewarding retrospective of the films of East German director 
Konrad Wolf continues Tuesday at 7 p.m. at the Goethe Institute, Suite 110, 
5700 Wilshire Blvd. "The Sun-Seekers" (1959) is one of Wolf's most complex 
works, a rousing drama set in a uranium mine in 1950 and revealing both its 
dangerous working conditions and tensions between Soviet administrators and 
German underlings. At its center are a sober, war-scarred young couple (Ulrike 
Germer, Gunther Simon) struggling to make their relationship work and an earthy 
older couple (Manja Behrens, Erwin Geschonneck) reunited after having worked in 
a circus years before. 
</P>
<P>
 Wolf comes out strongly for socialism, Soviet-German solidarity and the 
peaceful uses of nuclear power, but he was too much of an honest artist not to 
depict the mine as something less than an earthly paradise. As a result, this 
very fine film, made to celebrate the German Democratic Republic's 10th 
anniversary and slated to open just days before the Soviets resumed nuclear 
testing in October, 1959, was not released until 1972. 
</P>
<P>
 Like his gifted Hollywood counterparts, Wolf could make a suspiciously 
arbitrary ending work for rather than against him. This is the case with his 
1964 "The Divided Heaven" (Thursday at 7 p.m.), which bravely manages to be 
critical of virtually every aspect of East German communist society, protesting 
the evils of hidebound ideology in the classroom, in the workplace and 
especially in the laboratory.  
</P>
<P>
 Renate Blum and Eberhard Esche star as a student, preparing to be a teacher, 
and her lover, a brilliant research chemist tempted by the greater freedom of 
the West. You come away from "The Divided Heaven" reminded that Hollywood's 
dictates of the box office can be more restrictive than even those of an 
industry controlled by a rigid communist government. Information: (213) 
525-3388.

 MTV and the UCLA Film Archive present the one-week "Human Rights Watch 
International Film Festival" starting Friday at the Nuart. Among its feature 
films are Radu Mihaileanu's "Betrayal" (Saturday at 6:30 p.m.), a bleak yet 
compelling account of the terrible price exacted of a major poet (Johan Leysen) 
for release from prison after 11 years; Margarethe Von Trotta's admirably 
uncompromising "The Long Silence" (Friday at 9:30 p.m., June 16 at 9 p.m.) in 
which a resolute judge (Jacques Perrin), backed by his staunch wife (Carla 
Gravina), risks his life to investigate wide-ranging corruption in high places; 
Winfried Bonengel's "Beruf: Neo-Nazi" (Saturday at 9 p.m.), a documentary on 
the international neo-Nazi movement which derives its scary power from its cool 
detachment -- and which in turn ironically sparked a furor, and Jolanta 
Dylewska's powerful documentary "Chronicle of the Uprising in a Warsaw Ghetto 
According to Marek Edelman" (Sunday at 4 p.m., June 16 at 7 p.m.).

STREET SMART: ADDITIONAL BOTTS DOTS TO BE INSTALLED ALONG MOULTON PARKWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROLINE LEMKE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 A letter I had written to you appeared in the Jan. 31, 1994, issue of Street 
Smart. Are you interested in knowing the results? 
</P>
<P>
 In a few weeks, Botts dots were installed on Moulton Parkway going north from 
El Toro Road to the first stop sign, which is Gate 12 of Leisure World. From 
there to Santa Maria Avenue (the area that I was most concerned about) there 
are none ! 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, from Santa Maria to Lake Forest Drive the Botts dots are visible. The 
problem of locating the left turn from Moulton Parkway to Santa Maria in the 
face of the car lights (going south) coming up the hill still exists. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, going south, the Botts dots were installed from Ridge Route to Santa 
Maria and then they stop. Shouldn't they continue to El Toro?  
</P>
<P>
 I find all this puzzling.  
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Ignacio Ochoa, Orange County traffic engineer, says the missing Botts dots are 
on their way. A crew from county traffic engineering should be installing the 
new dots within the month, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 I am writing to you concerning the intersection of MacArthur Boulevard and 
Douglas in Irvine. Specifically, the traffic signal will activate allowing cars 
to turn left from Douglas onto MacArthur, even if there are no cars waiting to 
make such a turn. 
</P>
<P>
 The result is that cars traveling north on MacArthur are delayed at the 
traffic signal much longer than is necessary, as are cars waiting to turn left 
from MacArthur onto Douglas. 
</P>
<P>
 The traffic signal should be programmed not to have the left turn signal from 
Douglas to MacArthur activate unless there is a car waiting to make the turn. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 Under normal circumstances, the traffic signals work the way you think they 
should, said John Thai, senior transportation engineer for Irvine. But because 
of major construction going on in the area, everything's out of whack. 
</P>
<P>
 The sensor loops that dictate to signals were destroyed during construction, 
Thai said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sacrificing efficiency for safety, all signals in that area have been put on a 
kind of automatic pilot that goes through every signal option no matter what 
the traffic may be, he said.  
</P>
<P>
 The old signal coordination will return when construction is completed at the 
end of summer or early fall, Thai said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart:  
</P>
<P>
 Recently, the traffic signal at Bolsa Chica Road and Duncannan Avenue in 
Westminster has been set so that traffic flowing on Bolsa Chica invariably 
stops for a red light on Duncannan. There is almost no traffic on Duncannan, 
while Bolsa Chica is a major thoroughfare between the San Diego Freeway and 
Pacific Coast Highway. Is it possible for this traffic signal to be reset, as 
it was previously, to allow traffic to flow on Bolsa Chica without stopping at 
the intersection at Duncannan?  
</P>
<P>
 This condition exists during rush-hour traffic, as well as in the wee hours of 
the night. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 The signals at the Bolsa Chica Road and Duncannan Avenue intersection are 
coordinated to allow the maximum amount of traffic to flow on Bolsa Chica, said 
Marwan Youssef, traffic engineer for Westminster. Drivers on Duncannan are the 
ones who usually complain about having to wait a long time, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Like all the signals on Bolsa Chica in Westminster, from the San Diego Freeway 
to the city limit, the signals are traffic responsive, meaning Bolsa Chica 
always has the green light until cross traffic approaches an intersection, 
Youssef said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the case of Duncannan, a driver can approach the intersection, trigger a 
sensor loop embedded in the road, and still have to wait up to two minutes 
before the light turns green, he said.

GEORGE RAMOS: THIS FAMILY FEUD WASTES VALUABLE POLITICAL PASSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE RAMOS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I'm awfully glad the election is tomorrow because I'm fed up with L.A.'s 
version of the Hatfields and McCoys. 
</P>
<P>
 They gossip and they hurl mud at each other. They believe that they alone have 
the right stuff when it comes to politics, especially as it affects L.A.'s 
Latinos. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm referring to the feud between County Supervisor Gloria Molina and her 
loyalists, and the three politicos they love to hate -- state Sen. Art Torres, 
Assemblyman Richard Polanco and L.A. City Councilman Richard Alatorre -- and 
their followers. In the days leading to the primary election, the phone hasn't 
stopped ringing as both sides have traded insults. The callers have insisted on 
anonymity before spilling their guts on the latest "outrage" committed by the 
other side. 
</P>
<P>
 It got so bad that by Friday, I happily turned off my phone to go see the 
dentist, who wants me to have a root canal. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The latest episode in this soap opera flared after Molina appeared Wednesday 
at a Downtown news conference to endorse Westside Assemblyman Burt Margolin, 
who is seeking the Democratic nomination for insurance commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
 In doing so, she ignored Torres, who also is running for the post. If Torres 
is successful -- and a recent Times Poll showed he had a comfortable lead over 
Margolin -- he will become the first Latino to hold statewide office in 
California in more than 100 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Torres, who supported Molina when she first ran for the Assembly in 1982 but 
later had a falling-out with her, is the man she defeated in a bitter election 
in 1991 to win her current job. 
</P>
<P>
 Molina knew she would be asked about Torres and had a reply ready. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you're talking about the insurance commissioner, you really need a solid 
advocate . . . who is going to stand up to the special interests," she told 
reporters. "And very frankly, Art and I had our disagreements (on Proposition 
103, which created the elective position of insurance commissioner). I was a 
strong supporter and I sent out mail on the proposition and Art was on the 
other side. 
</P>
<P>
 "We would like to see Latinos who are going to be in statewide office. But in 
this particular instance, what really outweighed it is the importance of this 
issue, particularly for my community." 
</P>
<P>
 I wasn't surprised by her slam against Torres and neither were the callers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Gloria Molina won't allow herself to support a Latino for statewide 
official," a Torres supporter claimed. "She should be ashamed of herself." 
</P>
<P>
 The Molinistas had their spin. 
</P>
<P>
 "Gloria beat Torres, and his people are still crying about it," one Latina 
explained. "If Art wins the primary, Gloria will support the Democratic ticket. 
She is a Democrat. Right now, she thinks Margolin is better." 
</P>
<P>
 The focus of the incoming calls soon shifted from the state commissioner's 
race to others where Molina and her opponents, particularly Polanco, have 
staked their political capital. One such contest is in the 45th Assembly 
District, where ethnicity is a factor. 
</P>
<P>
 "Molina is for the empowerment of the Latino community," one Molinista said, 
"and that is among the reasons she is supporting Antonio Villaraigosa. Polanco, 
by supporting a non-Latino (Bill Mabie), isn't." 
</P>
<P>
 One Torres/Polanco political insider retorted: "In an ideal situation, Polanco 
ought to find a Latino candidate to support. But when he went looking, every 
Latino he approached turned him down. If you're going to be outraged at 
Polanco, then you have to be outraged at Molina for not supporting a qualified 
Latino candidate for statewide office." 
</P>
<P>
 By the 40th call, things got nasty. The callers brought up everything from 
Torres' two drunk-driving arrests to Molina's gain in weight to Villaraigosa's 
brush with the law about 17 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "Molina is dishonest," one side said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Polanco is a vendido (sellout)," the other said. 
</P>
<P>
 By No. 52, I started hanging up on them. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why are you defending Torres and Polanco?" a Molina supporter persisted. 
</P>
<P>
 "You really love Gloria, don't you?" a Torres sympathizer concluded. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, I admire Molina's guts and determination to open up the bureaucracy 
for the underprivileged. And I think Torres is an eloquent champion for Latinos 
who has shown grace in overcoming personal problems. 
</P>
<P>
 But the passion and energy I heard in those calls were wasted. They should 
have been channeled into combining their might to fight the rising tide of 
immigrant bashing, to persuade President Clinton to address Latino concerns 
about unemployment and education, and to fulfill the goals these leaders have 
for their communities. 
</P>
<P>
 Politics may be politics, but these folks need to grow up.

 ANGIE KENER 
</P>
<P>
 Graduate of Whittier College, 23; bachelor's degree in psychology 
</P>
<P>
 I'm an admissions counselor at Mount St. Mary's College (a Catholic liberal 
arts college in West Los Angeles). I recruit students, counsel them about 
higher education and assist them and their families through the transition from 
high school to college. I also plan programs to acquaint students with our 
school. 
</P>
<P>
 I got interested in admissions counseling because I did it during my sophomore 
year as part of a work-study program. I might eventually go back to school for 
a higher degree and go into clinical psychology or neuropsychology. But right 
now this job is great. 
</P>
<P>
 I've learned a lot that I can carry into any other profession, whether it's 
interviewing techniques, writing letters or speaking in public on the spur of 
moment. 
</P>
<P>
 In admissions, you have to be a team player. Your goal as a group is to get 
the class for next year. I know I'm lucky because the people I work with are 
very enjoyable and I have a great boss. She gives us responsibility and lets us 
run with it. She lets us make our own mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
 The toughest thing is the commute (from Whittier to West Los Angeles). And my 
hours can vary. So I leave home at 6:30 or 7 a.m. and I can be home as late as 
8:15 p.m. It's exhausting. Sometimes you miss the spring breaks, and it seems 
like work will never end. 
</P>
<P>
 I have a real sense of accomplishment, knowing I can put in the hours and see 
a program I was in charge of be successful. I like seeing students and families 
happy when they leave the campus. 
</P>
<P>
 I believe people touch other people, some in big ways and others in little 
small ways. And I think I've been encouraging to students. I've also shown to 
my colleagues what I can do and what they can do. 
</P>
<P>
 The psychology classes I took in college, plus my experience in the admissions 
office there, really helped. If there is something I would do differently it 
would have been to take more math and history, so I could understand more about 
the world. 
</P>
<P>
 But the biggest thing I learned in college was to be myself. This job has 
helped me take charge of my life.

 Children's advocacy is not just the work of men and women with children of 
their own, but for all of us. 
</P>
<P>
 The following story is from Marian Wright Edelman, president of the Children's 
Defense Fund. It best illustrates how important each of us can be to children 
around us.  
</P>
<P>
 "From the first day he stepped into my class," wrote a new teacher, "I 
disliked Teddy. He was dirty. He knew I didn't like him, but he didn't know 
why. Nor did I know -- then or now -- why I felt such an intense dislike of 
him. All I know is that he was a little boy no one cared about, and I made no 
effort on his behalf. 
</P>
<P>
 As Christmas approached, I knew that Teddy would never catch up in time to be 
promoted. To justify myself, I went to his cumulative folder.  
</P>
<P>
 First grade: "Teddy shows promise by work and attitude, but has a poor home 
situation." 
</P>
<P>
 Second grade: "Teddy could do better. Mother terminally ill. He receives 
little help at home." 
</P>
<P>
 Third grade: "Teddy is a pleasant boy. Helpful but too serious. Slow learner. 
Mother passed away end of the year." 
</P>
<P>
 Fourth grade: "Very slow but well behaved. Father shows no interest." 
</P>
<P>
 Well, they passed him four times, but he will certainly repeat fifth grade! Do 
him good! I said to myself.  
</P>
<P>
 Teachers get gifts from students at Christmas. Teddy's gift was wrapped in a 
brown paper bag and he had colored Christmas trees and red balls all over it. 
It was stuck together with masking tape. I felt conspicuous as the group stood 
watching me unwrap the gift. Two items fell to my desk: a gaudy rhinestone 
bracelet with several stones missing and a small bottle of dime-store cologne 
-- half empty. 
</P>
<P>
 I could hear the snickers and whispers. "Isn't this lovely?" I asked, placing 
the bracelet on my wrist. "Teddy, would you help me fasten it?" He smiled shyly 
and fixed the clasp and I held up my wrist for all to admire. There were a few 
oohs and aahs but as I dabbed the cologne behind my ears, all the girls lined 
up for a dab too.  
</P>
<P>
 "You smell just like Mom," Teddy said softly. "Her bracelet looks real pretty 
on you too. I'm glad you liked it." 
</P>
<P>
 He left quickly and I locked the door, sat down at my desk and wept, resolving 
to make up to Teddy what I had deliberately deprived him of -- a teacher who 
cared. 
</P>
<P>
 Slowly but surely he caught up with the rest of the class. Gradually there was 
an upward curve in his grades. He did not repeat fifth grade. In fact, his 
final averages were among the highest in the class. 
</P>
<P>
 I did not hear from Teddy until seven years later: "Dear Miss Thompson: I just 
wanted you to be the first to know. I will be graduating second in my class 
next month. Very truly yours, Teddy Stallard." 
</P>
<P>
 Four years later, Teddy's second letter came: "Dear Miss Thompson: I was just 
informed that I'll be graduating first in my class. The university has not been 
easy, but I liked it. Very truly yours, Teddy Stallard." 
</P>
<P>
 And today, Teddy's third letter: "Dear Miss Thompson: As of today I am 
Theodore J. Stallard, M.D. How about that? I'm going to be married in July, the 
27th, to be exact. I wanted to ask you if you could come and sit where Mom 
would sit if she were here. I'll have no family there as Dad died last year. 
Very truly yours, Ted Stallard." 
</P>
<P>
 I'm not sure what kind of gift one sends to a doctor on completion of medical 
school and state boards. Maybe I'll just wait and take a wedding gift, but my 
note can't wait. "Dear Ted, Congratulations! You made it and you did it 
yourself! In spite of those like me and not because of us, this day has come 
for you. God bless you. I'll be at the wedding with bells on!" 
</P>
<P>
 There are millions of Teddy Stallards -- children we have forgotten, given up 
on, left behind. How many Teddys of the world will never become doctors, 
lawyers, teachers, or police officers because there was no Miss Thompson? Or no 
you? How many of us would never be where we are today without that special 
teacher, or coach, or youth leader, or relative who believed in us and helped 
us do our best? 
</P>
<P>
 Any one of us can be a Miss Thompson and everyone of us must -- in our own way 
-- if we are to heal our children's pain.

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In cities across the nation, street vendors -- those entrepreneurs who hawk 
everything from hot dogs and ice cream to T-shirts and "solid gold" watches -- 
turn ordinary streets into often colorful outdoor bazaars. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, a lot of people prefer to keep their streets ordinary. They 
complain that the vendors block sidewalks, dump trash and take business away 
from store and property owners, all the while not paying taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 No matter what you think of street peddling, selling merchandise from a cart 
is about as American as, well, hot dogs and ice cream. For many immigrants, it 
is the first shot at the American dream. 
</P>
<P>
 That shot did not legally exist in Los Angeles until January, when the City 
Council finally met the demands of a coalition of groups -- many of them 
minorities -- tired of being penalized for peddling their wares. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision to create eight districts where newly licensed vendors could sell 
their merchandise has created its own set of problems. In today's Platform, 
street vendors, city officials and businessmen discuss the logistics of 
legalizing street sales. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, if the experiences of other large American cities is any measure, 
regulating street vending will not be a panacea. 
</P>
<P>
 Take New York City, where "street vending is part of the landscape," according 
to Marc Wurzel of the city's Department of Consumer Affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've lost 400,000 jobs in the past five years and that's affecting small 
business owners," Wurzel says. "We're confronted with the problem of making 
sure vendors have their opportunities but also recognizing we can't close our 
eyes or ears to the calls of small business owners." 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, Wurzel says, the city has been locked in an endless cycle of 
cracking down on the thousands of illegal street vendors, only to be forced 
back in a corner by the inevitable uproar that follows. 
</P>
<P>
 Regulating street vendors -- making sure they are licensed, keeping them in 
designated areas, ensuring that they contribute to the tax base -- is a 
challenge for every city. Yet, every city tries a different method, none of 
them guaranteed. 
</P>
<P>
 In Chicago, vendors are prohibited from selling any food that must be prepared 
or cooked and, in some wards, vendors are banned altogether. "There are 
frequently violations of that," says John Holden, a spokesman for the city's 
Department of Revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 "You get fly-by-night merchants coming by with food carts so, just in the last 
couple of years, there has been a growing trend to restrict the activities of 
peddlers," Holden says. 
</P>
<P>
 Regulations aside, street vendors are not likely to disappear any time soon. 
"My own view is that street vending is perfectly acceptable and should be 
encouraged," says Alfred E. Osborne, Jr., director of the entrepreneurial 
studies center at UCLA's Anderson Graduate School of Management. 
</P>
<P>
 Adds Osborne: "It's a way for someone without skills to earn a living on their 
way up and to be socialized into a society."

 In an ideal world, children grow up in a nurturing environment that encourages 
them to be their best. But in reality, many are abused: More than 139,000 
emergency referrals were reported in Los Angeles County in 1992 (the most 
recent figures available from the Los Angeles County Interagency Council on 
Child Abuse). Many other cases go uncounted since these young victims often 
don't know where to go to get help. Of the agencies that intercede, none can 
claim the longevity of Five Acres/The Boys' and Girls' Aid Society of Los 
Angeles. Founded in 1888 as an orphanage, the Altadena-based nonprofit program 
has assisted more than 10,000 families and children. Its pioneering efforts 
include a program for abused deaf children, which has resulted in special 
courts and signing programs for care-givers. Five Acres' $7.6-million annual 
budget, comes from groups including the Pasadena Unified School District, the 
California Office of Criminal Justice Planning and private and corporate 
concerns. Says Thomas Kubasak, associate director of the California Assn. of 
Services for Children: "Five Acres has the array of services that allows them 
to serve a large number because they're meeting different needs." HOW IT WORKS

 In addition to the 212 full- and part-time social workers, teachers and 
various therapists at Five Acres, children also get support from 1,235 
volunteers who visit at least once a year. Among them are Meshack Taylor, an 
actor in the TV sitcom "Dave's World," and Dodgers pitcher Orel Hershiser. 
Here's why they're involved: 
</P>
<P>
 MESHACK TAYLOR: "Back when I was on 'Designing Women,' I spoke at a shelter in 
Fresno and was totally blown away because I was unaware of the level of abuse," 
says the father of four children ranging in age from 3 to 25. "When I moved to 
Altadena four years ago, Five Acres was right around the corner. Imagine the 
worst thing you can do to a child: There are five or six kids there that have 
had that done to them, betrayed by the closest members of their family. I go to 
events, work the annual fund-raiser and do interviews out there to draw 
attention to the facility and the problem. People need to get involved however 
they can: financially, volunteering or just calling the police when they see 
something happen." 
</P>
<P>
 OREL HERSHISER: "When I grew up, I took for granted that you could trust your 
parents and not worry about abuse but a visit to Five Acres shows that's not 
the case," says the father of two sons, 5 and 9, who has spent time at the 
facility since 1987. The Dodgers star plays ball with the children, sizing them 
up just like he does the major league hitters he faces. Before he leaves the 
playground, he makes sure that everyone has a chance to bat and gets a hit: "If 
these kids hit the ball well and I'm the one throwing it to them, that means a 
lot to them. They'll remember success. They don't need another failing event in 
their lives." TO GET INVOLVED

VENDOR LAW ERODES QUALITY OF LIFE'

 Street vendors in Los Angeles won a major victory in January when the City 
Council voted to legalize the sidewalk entrepreneurs in designated districts. 
But the victory has proven bittersweet. Six months after the council vote, not 
one district has been established and no permits have been issued. In the 
meantime, vendors claim police are cracking down on them. The issue came to a 
head last Tuesday with a protest in front of LAPD headquarters in Downtown Los 
Angeles.  
</P>
<P>
 Sgt. DENNIS ZINE 
</P>
<P>
 Director, Police Protective League 
</P>
<P>
 This is just another failed attempt by the Los Angeles City Council to appease 
an individual group in the community. This City Council is trying to appease 
all these groups by permitting an erosion in our quality of life. I compare 
this to what the city did with amnesty. All they're doing is permitting 
something that's illegal. Why don't they make driving through a red light 
legal? Why don't we just become like Nevada and make prostitution legal and 
make gambling legal? 
</P>
<P>
 They keep saddling the police with more and more regulations to enforce. Some 
parts of this city are like a third-world country. That's what offends me. The 
quality of life is eroding at a rapid pace. JAVIER RODRIGUEZ 
</P>
<P>
 Administrator, Street Vendors Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 The trouble with the law that it is inherently bureaucratic. You have to 
comply with 10 different things to be able to petition for a license. Then 
there are five different phases to go through to get a district approved. 
</P>
<P>
 The police have targeted the street-vendor law to make sure it does not work. 
They are undermining the law in a way that does not permit these people to go 
and work. They have to be able to go out and work. They have to be able to out 
and organize in a peaceful environment. We've gone through a lot of different 
things to make the LAPD aware that a law has been passed. And there has to be a 
window period. 
</P>
<P>
 The street vendors are the most organized sector of the new entrepreneurial 
class. They have an office. They have some money. So they are a sore point 
among many on the political right. 
</P>
<P>
 What you have right here with the street vendors is an immigrant-bashing 
campaign. And someone in the police department has made that decision. What we 
are looking for is for the Police Commission to impose discretion. What we're 
asking Chief (Willie) Williams to do is come down to reality. He's saying that 
the street vendor is not a target. But when you get down to the level of 
captain and the people in the street, it's very different. MIKE HERNANDEZ 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles City Council member 
</P>
<P>
 The enforcement issue is a little complicated. The police are only enforcing 
the ordinance as it's written. I don't think there's any racism, but they're 
getting complaints from areas that are highly Latino and the particular area 
they are talking about is highly concentrated with street vending. 
</P>
<P>
 I was in favor of the idea of an ordinance to legalize street vending, but I 
disagree with how complicated they made it. But right now that's all we have, 
so we have to work with it. I'm working now with a group called PASEO, which 
stands for Pedestrian Area for Shopping and Economic Opportunity. That group is 
changing the perception of street vending in their old area. But they can't do 
that unless the area has been designated as a district for street vending. 
</P>
<P>
 It's hard to tell how you're going to create a district in an area that 
doesn't want one. We're going to create a district where it can be created by 
changing the image of street vending, by working with the businesses and 
working with the residents and showing the people how it can complement their 
businesses. We want to set up one district that works and use that as a model. 
CARMEN CASTELLANO 
</P>
<P>
 Street vendor 
</P>
<P>
 Our children are asking us for food and they need clothes and they have to 
study. We have bills to pay. We have to look for a way to survive. We have to 
work. And we're trying to work but the police won't leave us alone. 
</P>
<P>
 We don't want the government to give us anything. We want to contribute to the 
city. We want to pay taxes. We want to work within the law. But they won't give 
us the chance. They have many officers working against us, the street vendors. 
They harass us, they take our things, they arrest us and give us tickets, 
expensive tickets. 
</P>
<P>
 There's nothing wrong with the (street vendor) law, it's that they are making 
another law on their own independently. They say the police are just enforcing 
the law. But it's a lie. 
</P>
<P>
 It's complete racism. Pure racism. They aren't giving us the opportunity to 
support ourselves like we want. We want to demonstrate to them that we can work 
and we can be living well in accord with the laws as the law says. But they 
won't give us the opportunity.

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES: COMMUNITY ESSAY; 
UPLAND CAN BLAME IT ALL ON CITY HALL -- LITERALLY; WHEN IT COMES TO OFFICE 
SPACE, ENTER THE PETER PRINCIPLE -- RESIDENTS CAN THANK BUREAUCRATS FOR A 
BUILDING THEY DON'T NEED AND A COMMUNITY THEY DON'T RECOGNIZE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT CAMBELL, Robert Campbell, a resident of Upland, studied public 
administration at the graduate level at Cal State San Bernardino. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was the City Hall. That is what did it. The City Hall is what ruined 
Upland. Before they built the City Hall. Upland was a nice little town. A 
folksy place. And Upland did not need a fancy new City Hall. Nor could Upland 
afford such a fancy City Hall. But some of those professional management 
"types" came to town and sold a bill of goods to gullible members of the City 
Council. So, Upland got the City Hall it did not need. And that is what ruined 
Upland. 
</P>
<P>
 The trouble with the new City Hall is space. With all that office space, if 
they did not use it, then the bureaucrats would look foolish. They just had to 
go out and import a lot more bureaucrats so as to justify building the City 
Hall. And when it comes to office space, here the Peter Principle applies: 
"Government staffing expands until all available office space has been filled." 
(Then they buy more space.) So the bureaucrats brought in a steady stream of 
hired mercenaries. These professionals, like them, did not know the people of 
Upland and did not want to know them. They came only to make a buck; as soon as 
anyone offered them more money, they'd pack up and move on. 
</P>
<P>
 It was really quite a chore to find excuses to hire professionals just to fill 
up all that unneeded space. So they went to other cities and learned about all 
sorts of functions that the city did not really need. They would eagerly read 
each issue of "California City" so as to find out "what the well-dressed city 
will wear." Soon our little town of Upland sported all the stylish 
accouterments of a big city! And the unfortunate citizens of Upland were 
compelled to get used to enduring all these "functions" bestowed upon them 
against their wills by these "public servants" to justify their place at the 
public trough. "How many ways may I serve thee; let me count the ways!" 
</P>
<P>
 And so, from all over California, managers of all kinds streamed into City 
Hall. They filled up all the office space and began their job of ruling over 
their new domain. To Upland residents these were "professional" people who did 
not know nor like the longtime residents of Upland. So they communicated with 
the people as little as possible. And the people of Upland disliked their new 
rulers and did their best to keep out of their way. Because "those people in 
City Hall" were a major source of trouble. In order to justify their paychecks 
they spent their days inventing new rules and regulations for mere citizens to 
live by. 
</P>
<P>
 As far as the people were concerned, these were nonsensical rules enforced by 
nincompoops. As the saying goes, "Give a small man a little authority and he 
will become king!" And these rules cost the people far more than the City Hall 
salaries. For example, an old lady lost her home to fire. Her insurance 
guaranteed "100% rebuilding." But City Hall refused to let her rebuild in such 
a way that the insurance company refused to rebuild it. And if the lady could 
get a loan, rental income would cover less than half the loan payments. 
Consequently the lady's house will remain a vacant lot while she pays rent to 
live elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Now we mere citizens mourn the death of our town as we knew it, while our 
hard-earned dollars go to pay the hired mercenaries. All we get in return are 
more and more hassles as City Hall intrudes further and further into our lives. 
</P>
<P>
 As the inhabitants of a small nation once observed, "We do not like to be 
ruled by outsiders. But, if we must have rulers, we thank God that they are the 
British!" Of course, our new rulers are not British. No one knows for sure just 
who they are. But we do know that we do not like them. Help! Help! Send us the 
British!

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES: GIVING BACK; LAWYERS 
WHO DEVOTE TIME TO MAKING THINGS RIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Meadow talked with Berkley Hudson. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Robin Meadow is a partner in the Los Angeles law firm of Loeb and Loeb. He 
serves on the board of Public Counsel, a nonprofit, Los Angeles organization 
that bills itself as the nation's largest pro bono law office. It provides free 
legal advice to those who can't afford a lawyer. Big and small Southern 
California law firms, and businesses too, give financial support. The Los 
Angeles County Bar Assn. and the Beverly Hills Bar Assn. co-sponsor Public 
Consul. Meadow talked with Berkley Hudson.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 You might call the people Public Counsel normally serves working poor. These 
are people who are taken advantage of by loan sharks, unscrupulous landlords, 
unscrupulous vocational schools or by a whole raft of evil people. 
</P>
<P>
 Public Counsel gets the best and brightest volunteers from law firms around 
town. I joined Public Counsel in 1988. The president of the County Bar, 
Margaret Morrow, (now president of the California State Bar), asked me to get 
involved. She was extremely concerned about pro bono activities and about 
children's legal issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes organizations like Public Counsel get painted with a brush of being 
bleeding heart liberals. But the wrongs that Public Counsel corrects, such as 
slum housing or home equity fraud, are conduct that I don't think any 
responsible person -- regardless of where they fall on the political spectrum 
-- would tolerate. 
</P>
<P>
 It's difficult to find lawyers to volunteer for the good of the public, 
because you can't make money out of this. But we've been fortunate that large 
numbers of lawyers, especially younger ones, are not only prepared but are 
eager to work. Public Counsel also has enlisted law students in its homeless 
project. They work as advocates in the welfare office and other places, where 
these people are up against a solid bureacracy. 
</P>
<P>
 The students hopefully become imbued with the philosophy that public service 
is worthwhile. 
</P>
<P>
 Public Counsel's centerpiece is the volunteer legal services project. Public 
Counsel has a list of clients who need lawyers. They are referred or may come 
directly in the door. 
</P>
<P>
 I take my firm as mirroring other firms volunteering: Public Counsel clients 
get the same legal talent our other clients get. 
</P>
<P>
 A typical example we are very proud of is our work on home-equity fraud. You 
know people come around to sell you carpeting or appliances or whatever. They 
take a trust deed on your house for a gargantuan amount. Eventually you can't 
make the payments. Then they take your house. The only way to stop it is 
through a court proceeding. 
</P>
<P>
 There was a fellow named Roland Henry who was a victim. Public Counsel ended 
up not only rescuing his house but getting his estate -- he died while this was 
going on -- hundreds of thousands of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 When you get verdicts like that, it sends a message: There are lawyers who 
will devote time and resources to making things right. 
</P>
<P>
 We've worked with people seeking political asylum. And we were able to change 
an entire system in the immigration courts. 
</P>
<P>
 Immigrants would go into deportation proceedings where the court was run in 
English. There were inadequate interpreters. We were involved in a suit to 
change that. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a child - care project for people trying to set up day - care 
centers. These are small operators. They don't have a clue how to deal with a 
maze of regulation. 
</P>
<P>
 One thing that inspired me most about Public Counsel since I've been on the 
board happened in the wake of the riots, remember it broke out in full force on 
a Thursday: 
</P>
<P>
 Public Counsel people were back in their offices over the weekend, getting out 
faxes and phone calls to start rebuilding from a lawyer's perspective. They put 
together a special project and staffed it with volunteers who helped thousands 
of people. 
</P>
<P>
 Legal volunteers are doing things that keep the wheels of our society turning 
in ways most people don't think about. 
</P>
<P>
 Virtually every lawyer has skills that suit him or her to give something back 
to the community. There is a strong obligation to do this. 
</P>
<P>
 The number of problems that needs to be solved in a community as large as Los 
Angeles is extraordinary. Yet I'd like to think that Public Counsel and its 
counterparts are a major part of keeping things right.

<P>
 Los Angeles, 17 
</P>
<P>
 My getting pregnant was an accident. I really did love the baby's father. So I 
did it and I accepted the circumstances. Everything a teen-ager does, I still 
do. I still want to go to college. 
</P>
<P>
 My advice to other teen-age girls is to be careful and be prepared for what 
may happen. Do what you want to do. Don't let people pressure you. If you love 
someone, do it. If you don't want to do it, don't. MIRZA MADRID 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles, 17 
</P>
<P>
 I didn't want to have a baby. I was 14 years old when I had my little girl. I 
started to cry when I first found out. If I could do it all over again, I would 
get my high school diploma, a job and a place to live and wait until I'm about 
25 before I have a child. Right now I'm 17 and I want to have fun. But I can't. 
My goals now are to finish high school and become a police officer. 
</P>
<P>
 My advice to other girls is don't get pregnant. Babies are real cute and 
pretty, but they take a lot of work. It's hard. JENNIFER PICKETT 
</P>
<P>
 Venice, 17 
</P>
<P>
 My boyfriend moved in with us. We began to share the same room. I became a 
parent at 15 years old. I never considered abortion. I don't believe in it. I 
never thought about giving my daughter up for adoption, either. 
</P>
<P>
 My advice to other girls is to wait. It's hard juggling being a student, a 
parent and having a job. I have to work at Taco Bell to make ends meet. You 
can't go anywhere without your baby crying. You don't hardly have any friends 
because they always want to go out. I can't do that. DELORES LOVOYA 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County, 18 
</P>
<P>
 I have a 9-month-old child. I got pregnant when I was 16. Even though I've 
missed a lot of things because I have a baby, I'm really happy. I love my baby. 
</P>
<P>
 It has changed my life. Now I have to think about the future. I thought about 
college before I got pregnant, but I really didn't care. Now I know what I want 
to do. 
</P>
<P>
 My life is very regimented. I go to school and come home. I took a lot of 
extra classes, so I'm in school until 4 p.m. Also, a lot of girls fail to think 
about how much your body changes. My body has changed a lot. Everybody thinks 
it won't happen to me. I won't get pregnant. It happened to me, though. I used 
to be one of those people. LATRIVETTE HENDERSON 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County, 17 
</P>
<P>
 I have a daughter. She's 3. My baby was an accident. They didn't pass out 
condoms then. I'm a Christian. We don't believe in abortions. 
</P>
<P>
 Being a mother makes me very busy. At first, when my daughter was younger, it 
was easier. It gets harder as she gets older. I'm on the cheer squad at school, 
so I'm real busy. I'm hardly home. She's active and always wants attention. 
</P>
<P>
 It's very hard when you're trying to do homework. She wants to do homework, 
too. You can't tell her she can't do homework. She'll grab it and try to write 
on it. It's a sacrifice having a baby. I don't have much freedom any more. My 
relationship with my mother is not the same as it used to be. I live at home 
with my parents and I'm a parent, too.

 "I appreciate this place as a kind of sanctuary, a refuge from the industrial 
flatland that surrounds it. It's a nice place to drop in and get a whiff of 
poetry or just meditate.Each of the four lecterns has a different book on it. 
Someone in the morning will put out the books. I like the kind of trust of this

 DEMOCRATS ON THE RUN: As if the Democrats didn't already face enough trouble 
forestalling big Republican gains in the Senate this year, Sen. Edward M. 
Kennedy (D-Mass.) may have a serious reelection challenge for the first time in 
decades. A recent poll of Massachusetts voters by the Boston Globe found that a 
majority of respondents say they believe that someone else should be given a 
chance to serve. Kennedy, who is seeking a seventh term, is expected to be 
opposed by W. Mitt Romney, an articulate venture capitalist and the son of 
former Michigan Gov. George Romney who has the backing of the Massachusetts GOP 
and is likely to be well-financed. . . . Although Kennedy's supporters maintain 
that the 32-year incumbent has reversed his plunge in voter esteem resulting 
from the 1991 rape trial of his nephew, William Kennedy Smith, the Senate titan 
has shown surprising signs of vulnerability in other polls as well. At a 
minimum, the challenge will force the liberal lawmaker to expend considerable 
time and resources campaigning at a time when he is a key player in President 
Clinton's health care reform effort. . . . Said one national Democratic 
strategist: "He is taking this (election) very seriously." . . . The Democrats, 
who have a 56-44 Senate majority, are bracing for an overall loss of several 
seats in November's elections.

 WATKINS REDUX: With his notorious helicopter-borne golf outing, former White 
House aide David Watkins destroyed on one balmy afternoon the personal ties to 
the President that he had been profitably cultivating for years. Or did he? . . 
. Washington lobbyists and some White House aides say they believe that Watkins 
would be a prime catch for the lobbying trade -- and some say they wouldn't be 
surprised to hear that he had landed a six-figure job. Although the flap over 
the trip sorely strained Watkins' relationship with some Administration 
heavyweights, he still has close ties to some in the Arkansas crowd. During the 
President's 1992 campaign and since, Watkins proved he could get things done, 
aides say. And ethics rules, while making the White House off limits, wouldn't 
keep him from lobbying Congress or federal agencies on most kinds of business. 
. . . Watkins said lobbying is not one of the opportunities he is exploring. 
But he conceded that he's "not ruling anything out." . . . One big problem 
remains: Such a career move would renew complaints about the flexible ethics of 
a White House crowd that had once pledged to end such practices.

 WITH FRIENDS LIKE THIS: Guess who is racing to Clinton's defense in the 
Whitewater flap? Political extremist Lyndon LaRouche. A slick 64-page magazine 
put out by LaRouche followers suggests the attack on Clinton is a plot by 
British intelligence, angered by U.S. opposition to the International Monetary 
Fund's policy of "shock therapy" for Russia. "It is your presidency they are 
assaulting," the journal declared with alarm.

 NO MORE MR. NICE GUY? A month after he was passed over for a seat on the 
Supreme Court, Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt has begun to develop cracks in 
his much-heralded even temper. Babbitt is known for his consensus-building 
style, but when Sen. Hank Brown (R-Colo.) last week started slamming the 
compromise Babbitt had carefully crafted on grazing fees for federal lands, 
Babbitt got steamed. He packed his bags and headed to Colorado to stare down 
Brown on his own turf. Brown had been a key player in the grazing compromise, 
and Babbitt was apparently furious that he had started bad-mouthing the plan. . 
. . Babbitt's fit of pique came after the laid-back Arizonan unleashed a string 
of public epithets against the mining industry, which is fighting a sweeping 
land-use reform plan passed by the House. ALAN MILLER and PAUL RICHTER

ENDANGERED SPECIES; TRADITIONAL JAPANESE INDUSTRIES STRUGGLE TO SURVIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TERESA WATANABE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Far from the high-tech dazzle of an economic superpower, the people in this 
small seaside village still labor by hand and worry that their livelihoods may 
become obsolete. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the most prominent local industries -- glove making -- is struggling to 
survive amid a labor shortage, the yen's appreciation and brisk competition 
from China, the Philippines and other countries with low-cost labor. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone is wondering, 'What shall we do?' " lamented Kenji Tanaka, special 
assistant to the president of Urushihara Co., a local glove maker. "No one 
knows what the future will bring." 
</P>
<P>
 Shirotori is in Kagawa, the smallest prefecture on the smallest of four main 
islands of Japan, and its quandary exemplifies the quiet struggles of Japan's 
far-flung provinces. 
</P>
<P>
 They are places that technological advancement and rapid industrial growth 
have in varying degrees bypassed. "Most foreigners think of Japan as a 
high-tech country, but in the provinces there are still a lot of 
labor-intensive industries," said Yoshihisa Goto, a planning specialist with 
the Ministry of International Trade and Industry. 
</P>
<P>
 The provinces are not taking their fate passively: From the glove makers here 
on Shikoku Island to central Honshu's textile firms, from Hokkaido's fish 
processors to the shipping suppliers of Kyushu, the provinces are aiming to 
revamp and revitalize. 
</P>
<P>
 Prodded by mounting cries for help, parliament passed a special law in 1992 
establishing a 10-year program to help resuscitate local industry through 
subsidies, low-interest loans, tax breaks and other financial schemes.  
</P>
<P>
 The government has also renewed a program to help save traditional industries, 
crafts that create such culturally unique items as lacquerware, pottery, dolls 
and wooden sandals. The program, first begun in 1974 and renewed in 1992, 
grants subsidies to train young successors to the master artisans and to 
develop new products -- using traditional techniques for modern-day goods, for 
instance. 
</P>
<P>
 But the challenges facing local and traditional industries are formidable. Few 
young people want to succeed the aging artisans, who labor by hand in small 
mom-and-pop operations. In the lacquerware industry, for instance, an onslaught 
of cheap products from China and South Korea is underselling Japanese goods. 
</P>
<P>
 And the increasing Westernization of lifestyles here has shrunk the demand for 
traditional items, industry officials say. Many young consumers would prefer to 
buy Tiffany crystal than Japan's famous Wajima lacquerware. The exquisite 
pieces featuring glossy black surfaces painted with gilded cranes and other 
traditional scenes command as much as $950 for a single sake cup. But younger 
consumers nowadays view the lacquer designs as outdated, industry officials 
lament. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, manufacturing output in Japan's traditional industries has declined 
from $5.3 billion in 1983 to $4.7 billion in 1992. The number of workers has 
dropped from 290,000 in 1979 to 210,000 in 1992. And as young people of the 
province are drawn to the bright lights of Tokyo and Osaka, the percentage of 
workers aged 30 and younger has declined from 28.7% in 1973 to just 10.3% in 
1992, according to MITI figures. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a serious situation," said Ryosuke Chiba of MITI's traditional 
industries division. "Whether Japan likes it or not, cheap imports are coming 
in. There is nothing we can do but develop new products." 
</P>
<P>
 In the provinces themselves, however, that is far easier said than done. Take, 
for instance, Japan's lacquerware industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Aizu-Wakamatsu, a town nestled in a resort area of mountains and lakes 115 
miles north of Tokyo, has long been known as one of Japan's chief lacquerware 
centers. The craft came to the region more than 100 years ago when the reigning 
feudal lord sent for a Kyoto artisan to develop it locally. 
</P>
<P>
 The painstaking process involves several steps, from mixing the pitch-black 
lacquer brew to shaping the wooden bowl or tray, to applying the lacquer and 
then painting it with delicate designs. Most craftspeople specialize in just 
one of the steps. 
</P>
<P>
 But these days, Chamber of Commerce chief Yoshihiro Ichinose and lacquerware 
association head Tsutae Baba see their proud heritage about to disappear. 
</P>
<P>
 The recession of the last few years has pushed sales down by 20%. Already, the 
association has lost 16 of its members to bankruptcy. The average age of 
craftspeople is 60. Although the association is sponsoring a successor's 
training school with 12 students, that is hardly adequate to replace the 
imminent wave of retirees, Baba said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Working conditions in the lacquerware industry don't suit today's young 
people," he fretted. "Who wants to work until the middle of the night in a 
small, dark room? Young people want to work in big companies." 
</P>
<P>
 To make matters worse, the area is reeling from the impact of cheap Chinese 
lacquer, whose wholesale price is one-fourth that of the Japanese products. 
Aizu-Wakamatsu is more vulnerable to the competition than its rival to the 
south, Wajima, which has carved out a high-priced niche for itself. 
</P>
<P>
 Wajima lacquer is viewed as more art than utilitarian, with an elegant 
workmanship that the Chinese cannot yet match. But Aizu-Wakamatsu made a 
fateful decision in the 1960s to downgrade its product, after the supply of 
cheap raw lacquer from China was cut off in a diplomatic row. Now, more than 
90% of its product uses a plastic base instead of the traditional wood; on many 
items, a synthetic coating instead of authentic lacquer is used. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision was smart at the time, as lacquered soup bowls, trays and boxes 
were moving into mass use for the first time. Exports began to boom. But now 
the low-end items can be duplicated by Japan's Asian rivals. 
</P>
<P>
 Already, most Japanese lacquerware artisans use half-completed products from 
Korea and China and apply the all-important finishings themselves. What 
concerns officials here is the growing number of finished products entering the 
market -- and the discernible improvement in quality. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lacquerware is becoming a product of developing countries," Haruo Fukunishi, 
the industry association president, said with a sigh. 
</P>
<P>
 But suggest that the region should give up the craft, or seek to benefit from 
China's competitive advantage by importing more, and the response is sharp: 
</P>
<P>
 "Our intention is to preserve and protect the tradition of Aizu-Wakamatsu," 
Baba said. "If Aizu-Wakamatsu became known only as a place that sells Chinese 
lacquer, our name and meaning would disappear." 
</P>
<P>
 Solutions, however, are elusive. The industry petitioned the central 
government for an import ban on Chinese products but was rejected. Now, there 
is talk of designing new products, but few ideas have surfaced: lacquered 
nameplates or telephone cards, the use of lacquer in construction, such as 
doors or interior accents. 
</P>
<P>
 Over in Shirotori, glove making executives and officials are less bound to 
preserve a culture and tradition. They mainly want to preserve jobs and 
long-established knitting and sewing techniques that have made the town the 
glove making capital of Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, rather than fight China and other Asian nations, they are working 
with them. 
</P>
<P>
 The Swany Corp. first moved to China in 1984 and now has four companies making 
gloves near the Shanghai area. President Etsuo Miyoshi's company was one of the 
first in Shikoku to go abroad, setting up Korean factories as early as 1972, 
when labor rates in Japan started to rise. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the past 20 years, we've moved from exporting gloves to importing them, 
and 90% is from China," he said. "That's a very big change." 
</P>
<P>
 Other prominent glove makers, such as Kazuyoshi Urushihara, plan to automate 
more of their production, investing heavily in robotics to combat both the 
labor shortage and rising labor costs. Just as young people balk at becoming 
traditional artisans, they also shun manual labor. 
</P>
<P>
 But such options are out of reach for most of Shikoku's 170 glove makers, said 
Eiichi Nagata, director of the Kagawa office of the Japan External Trade 
Organization. 
</P>
<P>
 "Overseas production, mechanization with robots and other measures require 
huge capital, and these companies can't afford to do it so easily," Nagata 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I were mayor," said Urushihara, who doubles as chairman of the Japan Glove 
Industries Assn., "I'd forget about the glove industry. It does not have a 
bright future." 
</P>
<P>
 In Aizu-Wakamatsu, some say the same thing about their craft. 
</P>
<P>
 Yasuo Ogura of Misawaya Manufacturing Co., a lacquerware wholesaler 
hard-pressed by dwindling sales, defective Chinese goods and the declining 
appeal of the craft itself, had a quick answer when asked what he intended to 
do: "Go bankrupt." 
</P>
<P>
 But the artisans aren't ready to call it quits. Kenji Ushima, 53, one of the 
finest craftsmen in Wajima, says: "Our ancestors have handed down something new 
all the time, so we in Wajima will think of something."

GUIDING SOUTH AFRICA'S RESURGENCE; ECONOMY: SENIOR U.S. OFFICIALS AND BUSINESS 
EXECUTIVES TEAMED UP WITH THEIR COUNTERPARTS FROM THE NOW-DEMOCRATIC NATION 
OVER THE WEEKEND TO BEGIN WRESTLING WITH THE NEEDS FACING A NEWLY MULTIRACIAL 
GOVERNMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration is stepping for the first time into the uncertain 
but potentially lucrative business of trying to guide the economic resurgence 
of a newly democratic South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
 But the job of redrawing the nation's economy in a way that ensures that the 
transition to democracy translates into fundamental improvements in living 
standards for all South Africans is easier said than done. Just listen to 
Trevor Manuel, once an African National Congress intelligence officer and now 
South Africa's minister of trade and industry. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've inherited an economy that is fairly skewed," said Manuel, a man who 
displays a penchant for flowery ties and down-to-earth rhetoric. The 
Johannesburg stock exchange is the 10th-largest in the world, he notes, yet 
"South Africa is one of the few countries in the world where there is no 
McDonald's." 
</P>
<P>
 With personal encouragement from Vice President Al Gore and South African 
Executive Deputy President Thabo Mbeki, senior U.S. and South African officials 
teamed up with business executives from both countries in Atlanta over the 
weekend to begin wrestling with the economic needs facing the new multiracial 
government. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to build an economy," said Harry L. Schwartz, South Africa's 
ambassador to the United States. "We have tremendous resources to become a 
major economic power." 
</P>
<P>
 True, say less biased observers, eyeing a potential $20-billion market. But 
what about the promises Nelson Mandela made to the black majority as he 
campaigned successfully to become the country's first black president? What 
about building houses in black townships, supplying them with electricity and 
clean water, and revamping the educational system? 
</P>
<P>
 At its heart, the dilemma is this: Can South Africa attract the outside 
investment it needs for growth and wealth redistribution, while also meeting 
the political goal of reconciliation of the races and the economic goal of 
raising living standards of the black majority? 
</P>
<P>
 Vice President Gore is among those who answer affirmatively. The blueprint for 
change drafted by the African National Congress "doesn't ask for utopia," Gore 
said. "It asks for running water, flush toilets, schools, health clinics. But 
how can South Africa finance even these things in a country where the majority 
of the people have less than 10% of the wealth?" 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, according to South African officials, the commitment to both democracy 
and the free market is unwavering. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have not come carrying a begging bowl, but a national commitment to invest 
in people by investing in democracy," said Mbeki, who is calling for increased 
U.S. investment and two-way trade between the United States and South Africa.  
</P>
<P>
 How important is outside investment? 
</P>
<P>
 "It is vital," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration has committed itself to providing $200 million a 
year for three years in grants, loans and loan guarantees to assist in the 
process. But the real investment must come from outside government. "The key to 
the future of our relationship will be the private sector," Gore said. "That's 
what will create the jobs. That's what will create the income." 
</P>
<P>
 Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown says there is a short-term need for 
"hundreds of millions of dollars" of U.S. investment. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S.-South Africa Conference on Democracy and Economic Development was the 
first effort to bring the new South African elite together with those in the 
United States who are in a position to provide assistance -- without a massive 
commitment of government funds. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you just throw money at South Africa, you won't necessarily create a 
successful economy. The South Africans don't have the skills in public 
administration . . . that are part of a market economy," said one U.S. official 
involved in organizing the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 From the South African perspective, the objective is much broader. "The battle 
in South Africa is to ensure we can give this hard-won democracy some content . 
. . and reposition South Africa in the global economy," Manuel said last week 
in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 On the positive side, said Witney Schneidman, senior vice president of Samuels 
International Associates, an international trade and investment consulting 
firm, "the prospects are quite good."

 South Africa, Schneidman said, "has a first-world infrastructure." He cited 
its banking network, an established system of contract law, a relatively open, 
market-based economy and a geographical location that provides access to 
markets in other regions, such as the Indian Ocean rim. South Africa's 
$112-billion economy is beginning to grow, after four years of recession, and 
it has major deposits of gold and platinum. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, "there are a lot of misplaced expectations," Schneidman 
said. "Most people don't understand the gap between the white business 
establishment and black business." 
</P>
<P>
 The unemployment rate in South Africa is approximately 46%, average income of 
blacks is one-tenth that of whites, and the black literacy rate is half that of 
whites. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the upbeat tenor of the current discussions may involve a 
considerable amount of "blue-sky" expectations, said Walter Kansteiner, an 
African affairs expert who served on the National Security Council staff during 
the George Bush Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're not going to achieve reconciliation with the white community if you're 
going to slap huge taxes on the whites and go into a budget deficit," 
Kansteiner said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
 For now, potential investors are faced with seemingly unanswerable questions. 
Will the 75-year-old Mandela live out his term, which runs until 1999? Will he 
be replaced by a group less interested in reconciliation? Will Zulu nationalism 
increase in intensity and evolve into ethnic warfare? 
</P>
<P>
 Bertram Lee, a member of the board of directors of Reebok International Ltd., 
discounts the more pessimistic answers. "I've been an investor in Africa for 25 
years," Lee said. "Businesses that would look at their investments in a short 
term of three years or five years are missing the boat. . . . It's certainly 
not the way Reebok is looking at it." 
</P>
<P>
 Conferences such as the session in Atlanta, which was sponsored by the U.S. 
Information Agency, may turn out to be of limited value, according to some 
academics. Such gatherings are likely to do little in the short run to boost 
South Africa's economic growth, which has averaged less than 1% a year for the 
past decade. By some estimates, growth must average at least 5% for each of the 
next five years for Mandela to be able to carry out his program. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, South Africa is unlikely to really prosper until its wealthier 
citizens stop sending their investment money out of the country, reversing what 
has been a net capital loss since the 1980s. To accomplish this, Mandela must 
convince the business community in South Africa that his plans will not lead to 
onerous taxes or budget deficits, without alienating the black majority that 
brought him to power.

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA ENTERPRISE; OXNARD'S LTC PROPERTIES LEADS RALLY IN REITS; 
REAL ESTATE: COMPANY WITH $205 MILLION IN ASSETS RETURNED 39% TO SHAREHOLDERS 
LAST YEAR -- DOUBLE THE INDUSTRY AVERAGE -- BY INVESTING IN NURSING HOMES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Real estate investment trusts took a pounding in the late 1980s, but now 
they're coming back. And leading the Wall Street rally are health care REITs 
such as LTC Properties of Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, LTC shareholders got a hefty 39% return in the form of dividends 
and higher stock prices -- double the average return for the entire REIT 
industry, according to the National Assn. of Real Estate Investment Trusts, a 
Washington trade group. Even among health care REITs, LTC, with assets of about 
$205 million, is ahead of the pack. 
</P>
<P>
 Why? Because LTC has been putting all its money in nursing homes, which unlike 
other real estate, weren't overbuilt during the 1980s, thanks to state 
regulatory restrictions. So unlike hospitals, which are struggling with too 
many vacant beds, nursing homes have an overall occupancy rate above 90%, says 
Peter Sidoti, a health care analyst at Natwest Securities Corp. in New York. 
And demand for long-term elderly care continues to grow as the population ages. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think LTC is the most attractive of the health care REITs," Sidoti said. 
</P>
<P>
 A real estate investment trust is effectively a real estate mutual fund. REITs 
pool investors' cash and invest directly in properties or make mortgage loans 
on them. Because REITs pass most of their earnings through to shareholders, 
theoretically at least, they provide more income to investors compared to most 
other stocks. 
</P>
<P>
 But REITs tend to have boom and bust cycles. They fell out of favor in the 
mid-1970s, and again in the 1980s when the real estate market performed poorly, 
but in the last couple of years, investors have flocked back to REITs for their 
relatively high dividends. 
</P>
<P>
 The flurry of REIT trading has created a boom of new REIT market offerings on 
Wall Street, which is likely to spawn more competition for LTC. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, traditional banks that had once shied away from financing health care 
facilities are now starting to step back into the arena. Another risk for LTC 
is the uncertainty of national health care reform, which is driving sweeping 
changes in the medical industry. 
</P>
<P>
 But for now, LTC is one of only a few REITs that specialize in nursing homes, 
and analysts like LTC even more because of its experienced management. 
</P>
<P>
 LTC Chairman and Chief Executive Andre Dimitriadis and President William 
McBride used to be senior executives at Beverly Enterprises, the nation's 
largest operator of nursing homes, based in Fort Smith, Ark. In the late 1980s, 
the pair helped restructure Beverly Enterprises, and their experience in the 
field has paid off so far by finding good nursing-home operators and properties 
to invest in. 
</P>
<P>
 "Clearly, they know what they're doing," Andrew Turner said of LTC management. 
Turner is chief executive of Sun Healthcare, a large nursing home chain based 
in Albuquerque, N.M., and one of LTC's borrowers. 
</P>
<P>
 LTC -- short for Long Term Care -- started out in August, 1992, with a 
$142-million public offering of stock, at $10 per share, and convertible debt. 
Last March, LTC followed with a secondary offering of 4.8 million shares of 
common stock at $13.25 each, raising $60 million. 
</P>
<P>
 In New York Stock Exchange Trading Friday, LTC closed at $13.875, down 12.5 
cents. 
</P>
<P>
 While LTC buys nursing homes, most of the $280 million of investments it's 
made so far have been mortgage loans to partnerships that own or lease nursing 
homes in more than a dozen states, mainly in the Sun Belt. Last summer, LTC 
sold off about $75 million worth of these mortgages.

 With the latest success of such films as "The Flintstones" and "Maverick," 
Hollywood no doubt will continue its frantic rush to make into a movie 
virtually every old television show that ever aired. 
</P>
<P>
 With everything from "Gomer Pyle" to "Green Acres" now being developed, the 
number of available remakes may soon dry up. Should that happen, there is an 
ample list of failed TV pilots that could inspire a potential blockbuster. 
</P>

in Paris. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Attorney General," a show based on files from the California attorney 
general's office. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Hollywood Angel," about "a suave Hollywood publicist who is also a private 
eye." 
</P>
<P>
 * "Wake Up, Stupid," about an ex-prizefighter turned college professor. 
</P>
<P>

ECONOMICS OF THE WOULD-BE GOVERNORS; ELECTION: THIS DAY BEFORE THE PRIMARY, 
PLANS TO TURN THE STATE AROUND RANGE FROM ANTI-TAXES TO NEW AGE PHILOSOPHY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN PETERSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If you listen past the noisy accusations, you could almost get the idea that 
the candidates for governor are of a single mind when it comes to helping 
California's beleaguered economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Jobs, they earnestly declare, are needed more than ever. Red-tape gridlock 
must be broken up. Small business deserves a break. Defense conversion is 
vital. New, environmentally clean technologies are a key to the future. 
</P>
<P>
 Sound familiar? In fact, there are real differences among the contenders in 
Tuesday's primary election. Their philosophies range from the free-market, 
anti-tax vision of Republican challenger Ron Unz to the greener, New Age 
economics of Democrat Tom Hayden. 
</P>
<P>
 There is another difference: Gov. Pete Wilson alone is saddled with the 
misfortune of having served in office during the state's worst recession in 
decades, a period in which more than 600,000 jobs were lost. 
</P>
<P>
 The voters, of course, will decide how much he is to blame. But economists 
point out that, whoever prevails, a state governor lacks some of the key tools 
to manipulate the economy that are held by officials at the national level. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't control interest rates," notes Adrian Sanchez, an economist at 
First Interstate Bancorp in Los Angeles. "You can't go into deficit spending 
like the federal government. You can't impose tariffs on goods coming in from 
Arizona." 
</P>
<P>
 Adds Douglas Jeffe, executive vice president of Braun Ketchum Public Relations 
and a public affairs consultant to business: "Until you're there (in office), 
the realities don't necessarily sink in." 
</P>
<P>
 State Treasurer Kathleen Brown has promised a million jobs in the course of a 
four-year term. But that also is the number of new jobs that economists 
generally expect -- no matter who wins the election. 
</P>
<P>
 Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi has derided Brown's million-job target 
as a "slow-growth strategy." Wilson's campaign literature, meanwhile, pledges 
an extra 160,000 private-sector jobs per year on top of the 1 million already 
forecast. 
</P>
<P>
 In today's era of defense down-sizing and corporate cost-cutting, however, few 
analysts expect much more than a million new jobs in the next four years. 
</P>
<P>
 Whose leadership is most likely to help? Here's an overview of the candidates' 
major business and economic policies. 
</P>
<P>
 * Gov. Pete Wilson: The Republican incumbent argues that California's economic 
future is linked to foreign trade, small business and an improved business 
climate with a lighter burden of red tape. 
</P>
<P>
 He pushed hard to reform workers compensation rules, and many business leaders 
say last year's cost-cutting moves were a step in the right direction. 
</P>
<P>
 To create jobs, he has proposed a temporary, $1,000 tax credit for job 
creation and speeded up Caltrans construction contracts. Wilson also cites 
housing, such as the Century Freeway Housing project in Los Angeles, as one of 
the ways the state can create jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 He supports tax incentives for investment in small business and would help 
small companies by making more loan guarantees available. 
</P>
<P>
 To foster trade, he would double the state's $5-million export-finance 
program, expand California trade offices in Mexico City and Hong Kong and open 
one up in Taiwan. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson says his efforts are improving the state's much-maligned business 
climate, and he is counting heavily on economic recovery between now and 
election day. 
</P>
<P>
 "We must rebuild California job, by job, by job," he declares. 
</P>
<P>
 * Ron Unz: Wilson's challenger in the primary offers an easy-to-grasp economic 
platform based on the sort of conservative Republican ideas associated with 
Ronald Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obvious" keys to economic growth include lower taxes and fewer regulations, 
says the entrepreneur who runs a financial software business out of his Palo 
Alto home. 
</P>
<P>
 Unz proposes $7.5 billion in budget cuts designed to shore up the state's weak 
finances. To name just a few of the cuts, he would cancel pay hikes for state 
employees, restrict health care spending and freeze per-pupil spending totals 
in higher education. 
</P>
<P>
 Unz, who labels Wilson a "taxocrat" and has been endorsed by supply side guru 
Arthur Laffer, also says he would "invest in people and educate our work force 
to keep growth industries in California." 
</P>
<P>
 In keeping with his anti-government, free-enterprise approach, he would slash 
California's top income tax bracket to 5% from 11%. 
</P>
<P>
 * Kathleen Brown: The Democratic state treasurer, who repeatedly lashes into 
Wilson's economic stewardship, also would offer tax incentives to create jobs. 
She would assist start-up firms by exempting them from business income tax or 
corporate franchise tax burdens in their first year. 
</P>
<P>
 She also would tilt the state procurement process in favor of California 
companies and California workers. When possible, 50% of parts and supplies used 
in a state contract would have to be made in California. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown pledges to provide capital for small- and medium-sized enterprises, as 
well as emerging technologies and firms owned by women and minorities. 
</P>
<P>
 She would steer money for community reinvestment into disadvantaged areas, and 
she promises to finance all these programs by shifting around existing funds or 
using state revenue bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 Gov. Wilson, she declares, "can't hide from the fact that California has lost 
more than one job every minute of every working day he has been in office." 
</P>
<P>
 * John Garamendi: Sweeping health care reform is a key to the insurance 
commissioner's economic plan. Competing in the Democratic primary, he says it 
would free $5.5 billion annually in insurance, legal and other costs, and he 
would use the windfall "to stimulate the California economy and to assure that 
over the long term our economy will stay competitive." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked to clarify, he points to education, police, public works and 
transportation as examples of the spending he has in mind. 
</P>
<P>
 A rancher with an academic background in international finance, Garamendi 
supports a break in the capital gains tax to favor long-term investments in 
small, high-tech companies. He also would provide tax credits to assist defense 
firms in making the leap to non-defense activities. 
</P>
<P>
 As chairman of the Senate Revenue and Taxation Committee in 1987, Garamendi 
pushed legislation that lowered corporate tax rates and provided tax credits 
for research and development. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill, which became law, also allowed firms to carry over part of their 
operating losses into the future -- a provision he believes is of special value 
to struggling, start-up enterprises. 
</P>
<P>
 The state can nurture a modern transportation industry in California, he says, 
by providing bidding preferences and economic incentives. Over 20 years, "a 
$200-billion market would be created." 
</P>
<P>
 * Tom Hayden: Hayden would plug tax loopholes and press for pro-environmental 
economic development, such as renewable energy and an electric-car industry to 
achieve a sustainable economic future. 
</P>
<P>
 Cutting out tax provisions used by speculators in commercial real estate and 
certain large corporations would net more than $2.5 billion, he believes. 
</P>
<P>
 The state senator from Santa Monica speaks in broad terms of easing tax 
burdens on the middle class, while increasing the tax liability of polluters. 
</P>
<P>
 He also wants the rich to keep on paying: Hayden opposes lowering the state's 
top income tax bracket, now 11% for individuals with taxable income of $212,380 
($424,760 for couples), which is scheduled to drop to 9.3% at the end of next 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Hayden cites tourism as crucial to a sustainable economic future but worries 
that tourists will steer clear of California, unless the state undergoes 
sweeping reforms. 
</P>
<P>
 People "already know that California is polluted, congested, racially divided, 
unsafe," Hayden says. "We can only attract them if we reform ourselves."

 Alaska Delays Oil Lease Sales: New state rules established after environmental 
lawsuits halted oil exploration in Alaska's Cook Inlet earlier this year have 
delayed the North Slope and Gulf of Alaska sales, the Alaska Division of Oil 
and Gas said. Sale 79, comprising 818,392 offshore and onshore acres at Cape 
Yakataga on the Gulf of Alaska coast, is now delayed until May, 1995, officials 
said.The sale had been scheduled to be held later this month. Sale 80, 
comprising about 500,000 onshore North Slope acres on the northeastern border 
of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, will be delayed until June, 1995, from 
November. The two lease sales were pushed back by new rules lengthening 
public-comment periods and increasing requirements for state studies, said Ken 
Boyd, deputy director of the Division of Oil and Gas.

 Kidder, Peabody & Co. Sends Checks to Ex-Trader: The brokerage has written 
checks for $138,000 to Joseph Jett, in a move that may allow the General 
Electric Co. brokerage unit avoid expedited hearings on Jett's compensation 
claims.State Supreme Court Justice Martin Stecher said on May 15 that he would 
order expedited arbitration by a National Assn. of Securities Dealers panel on 
Jett's claim for $4.9 million from his brokerage account unless Kidder paid the 
$138,000 in bonus and deferred compensation. Kidder fired Jett and froze his 
accounts after it accused him of creating $350 million in inflated pretax 
profits through "phantom" trades of U.S. Treasury zero-coupon bonds. John 
Liftin, Kidder's general counsel, said if Jett accepts the checks, "(the case) 
goes to arbitration on the merits." Last month, Stecher ruled in favor of 
Jett's request that arbitration hearings take place under the auspices of the 
NASD, rather than the New York Stock Exchange, as Kidder wanted.

 AT&T Settles Gender Discrimination Suit: A judge has approved a $3.3-million 
settlement of a 17-year-old gender discrimination lawsuit against AT&T Corp. 
U.S. District Judge George Howard Jr. approved the settlement, which calls for 
$1.8 million to be paid to current and former female employees who claim AT&T 
paid them less than men or refused to promote them because of their sex. The 
remainder of the money is for attorneys' fees and litigation expenses, as well 
as possible payments to other members of the class action lawsuit.AT&T did not 
admit discrimination against female employees. In all, 1,600 women who worked 
at various units from 1976 to 1989 are to be compensated. The company will pay 
from $100 to $35,335 to each of them.

MARKET BEAT / TOM PETRUNO: GROWTH STOCKS RETURN TO LIVE UP TO THEIR NAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM PETRUNO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Some of Wall Street's long-favorite consumer growth stocks have quietly become 
the market's leaders again, after two years or more on hiatus. 
</P>
<P>
 Software giant Microsoft, retailer Home Depot and beer king Anheuser-Busch are 
among the classic 1980s growth issues that have rebounded sharply this year, 
after tumbling in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 The return of these old favorites is sparking debate over which stocks are 
likely to lead the next market rally, assuming the bull market that began in 
1990 is intact. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992 and 1993, "value" stocks were by far the market's best performers. The 
value group includes many industrial, financial and utility shares that 
typically sell for relatively low prices compared to their per-share earnings 
-- hence the term "value." 
</P>
<P>
 "Growth" stocks, meanwhile, usually sell for higher prices relative to 
earnings, but for a reason: As the category name implies, these firms typically 
boast above-average -- and consistent -- earnings growth, as opposed to the 
often-cyclical earnings of value stocks. 
</P>
<P>
 Growth stocks had a terrific run between 1989 and 1991, far outperforming 
value stocks in each of those years. But by the beginning of 1992, the tide 
turned in favor of value stocks, for two big reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 * Many growth stocks had become overpriced after their 1989-91 run-up. And 
when earnings growth for some major drug companies and food companies began to 
slow in 1992 (victims of health care reform and slower consumer spending, 
respectively), investors became suspicious of the entire growth-stock universe. 
</P>
<P>
 * Wall Street began to bet heavily on a turnaround for large industrial firms, 
as demand for their products increased and as years of cost-cutting translated 
into vastly improved earnings potential. Financial stocks also surged as 
interest rates continued to fall. 
</P>
<P>
 The end result: Value stocks handily beat growth stocks in 1992 and in 1993, 
the first time value had back-to-back better years than growth since 1983-84. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilshire Associates, which tracks separate growth and value stock indexes, 
says its value index rose 14% in 1992, versus a 5.6% rise in the growth-stock 
index. In 1993, value rose 12.7% while growth fell 0.8%. (All figures are total 
returns: net price change plus dividend income.) 
</P>
<P>
 So far this year, both Wilshire indexes were down about 2% through the end of 
May. The growth sector has been hurt by continued weakness in some big-name 
stocks, including Coca-Cola and Wal-Mart. The value sector has suffered from 
declines in utilities and some major industrial names, such as the Big Three 
auto stocks. 
</P>
<P>
 But measured since last October -- when the market began to rally briskly 
after stagnating for much of 1993 -- growth stocks have been outrunning value 
stocks by a wide margin, says Wilshire Associates analyst Mike Palmer. 
</P>
<P>
 From October through May, Wilshire's growth index was up 2.2%, while the value 
index dropped 5.2%, Palmer says. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if you consider only year-to-date performance, the simple fact that 
growth and value are about even in performance may suggest that investors are 
less interested in buying value stocks, and perhaps less interested in selling 
growth stocks as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "One could argue that value stocks' outperformance has come to an end," Palmer 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 However, other yardsticks still give value an edge. The Standard & 
Poor's/Barra Inc. growth and value indexes, which split the S&P 500 into the 
two camps, show value up 0.4% through May and growth down 2.3%. 
</P>
<P>
 In any case, it's clear that value is no longer way out in front. And the 
powerful resurgence this year of classic growth stocks such as Microsoft and 
Home Depot demonstrates that Wall Street's appetite for its old favorites has 
improved markedly from 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Why the return to growth stocks? William Dodge, strategist at Dean Witter 
Reynolds in New York, says growth stocks are benefiting in part because 
investors realize that at this stage of the economic cycle, "just any old 
(industrial) stock isn't going to work anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago, you bought auto stocks because auto sales were still depressed 
but sure to rebound eventually. Today, after two years of strong sales, it's 
reasonable to wonder how much better things can get for the auto industry. If 
you believe auto company earnings will peak in 1995, you probably aren't going 
to buy the stocks now. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, earnings of many classic growth firms have continued to rise 
at annual rates of 15% or better since 1992, even as the stocks have been 
dashed. 
</P>
<P>
 The result: Price-to-earnings ratios, or P-Es, of growth stocks are in many 
cases significantly lower today than two years ago. If Wall Street takes an 
increasingly dim view of the earnings potential in value stocks, investors will 
naturally look to growth stocks as an alternative. And if they find lowered 
P-Es on those stocks, the justification for buying them becomes that much 
greater. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, it may still be too early to say that growth stocks are taking over 
for value stocks. We may be in a stock-picker's market where some issues in 
both camps will do well, while the aggregate indexes perform poorly. 
</P>
<P>
 But it's worth noting that Wall Street responds to momentum. If more investors 
begin to perceive that the momentum is shifting back to growth stocks, their 
rebound could become a self-fulfilling prophecy. Growth vs. Value 
</P>
<P>
 After lagging "value" stocks since 1992, growth stocks overall are 
neck-and-neck with value issues this year, though both categories are down. 
Here are growth and value stock total returns since 1984, as measured by 
Wilshire Associates Inc. indexes. 03,07,08,08 Year Growth Value 1984 +2.7% 
+18.8% 1985 +32.7 +30.0 1986 +15.2 +21.9 1987 +4.4 +3.3 1988 +14.8 +22.3 1989

MUTUAL FUNDS / RUSS WILES: SPOTTING SOLID, ALL-WEATHER FUNDS IN THE STORM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUSS WILES, RUSS WILES, a financial writer for the Arizona Republic, 
specializes in mutual funds. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With the stock market showing a loss thus far in 1994, it's good to know that 
some equity mutual funds have a tradition of giving ground grudgingly. 
</P>
<P>
 All-weather funds don't necessarily make the best choices long-term, as their 
conservatism often implies mediocre overall returns. But for skittish 
shareholders who otherwise might be tempted to cash out at the wrong moments -- 
and never get back in -- these investments can be a good way to ride out the 
storms. 
</P>
<P>
 Morningstar Inc., the Chicago-based rating service, recently cited 10 funds 
for having avoided losses in any single year over the last decade. Morningstar 
excluded funds that didn't have the same manager or management team in place 
over the entire period, as such a disruption would call a fund's long-term 
record into question. 
</P>
<P>
 Long-term consistency is an accomplishment in itself, considering that the 
average mutual fund manager has been at the helm just 4.3 years, says Anthony 
Mayorkas, the Morningstar analyst who put together the list of 10 steady 
performers. 
</P>
<P>
 Although it's hard to identify a single characteristic that explains why all 
10 of these funds have succeeded in avoiding yearly losses, the following 
elements are factors: 
</P>
<P>
 * An ability to shift among asset classes. "Most of the funds hold bonds or 
cash to dampen volatility," Mayorkas says. "You won't find any 
aggressive-growth funds here." 
</P>
<P>
 Four of the 10 no-loss funds are balanced portfolios, which means they 
regularly maintain some bond investments to complement their stock holdings. 
The balanced approach has been an effective one over time, as the stock and 
bond markets rarely fall together in the same year. 
</P>
<P>
 That said, 1994 so far has proven to be one of those exceptional periods, and 
three of the balanced funds on Morningstar's list are showing small losses for 
the year to date. 
</P>
<P>
 * A focus on conservative stocks. The other six funds all pretty much 
emphasize stock investments, but the ones they choose tend to be large, 
established blue chip companies that pay dividends. 
</P>
<P>
 "With these types of companies, you lower your chances for negative 
surprises," says John Snyder, lead manager of the John Hancock Sovereign 
Investors A Fund. 
</P>
<P>
 "These companies are somewhat immune to what's going on out there, as they're 
able to grow their earnings and dividends despite the economic climate." 
</P>
<P>
 The John Hancock fund, as well as Wayne Hummer Growth, specifically aim for 
companies that have shown a history of increasing their dividends. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dividends are more important in the total-return equation than people give 
them credit for," says Alan Bird, co-manager of Wayne Hummer Growth. Over the 
long haul, stock market investments have returned about 10% a year on average, 
and dividends contributed 4.5 yearly percentage points of that, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 * A conviction that two (or more) heads are better than one. There's a 
perception that funds run by multiple managers are able to realize more 
consistent returns, as the managers will negotiate, compromise, debate and thus 
avoid making radical investment decisions. This theory receives some support by 
the funds on Morningstar's list, five of which are managed by more than one 
person. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's good to have someone to bounce ideas off of," Bird says. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the better-performing funds on the list, Investment Company of America, 
follows the unusual practice of splitting its assets among different managers, 
who each enjoy autonomy over a different slice of the portfolio. ICI's steady 
track record has helped it attract $19 billion in assets, making it the 
second-largest of all mutual funds. 
</P>
<P>
 * A resolve to hold down expenses. A mutual fund's investment return will be 
reduced by the amount of its operating expenses, so successful portfolios tend 
to keep a lid on costs. Six of the 10 funds on Morningstar's list charge 
shareholders less than 1% a year in operating expenses, and none exceeds 1.3% 
-- roughly the average expense rate for stock funds. 
</P>
<P>
 A fund's annual expense numbers do not, however, include any front- or 
back-end sales charges or loads, if applicable. Seven of the 10 funds do charge 
a load to investors, ranging from 4% to 6.5%. CGM Mutual, Dodge & Cox Balanced 
and Wayne Hummer Growth are the exceptions. 
</P>
<P>
 While all 10 funds deserve kudos for avoiding losses, it's worth noting that 
only six have also managed to outperform their peers over the 10-year period, 
according to Morningstar. 
</P>
<P>
 This select group, in order of performance, consists of CGM Mutual, Investment 
Company of America, FPA Paramount, Merrill Lynch Capital A, Dodge & Cox 
Balanced and John Hancock Sovereign Investors A. FPA Paramount is closed to new 
investors. 
</P>
<P>
 Looking forward, it's clear that some of these 10 steady funds have their work 
cut out for them over the remainder of 1994 if they want to log another year in 
the plus column. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result of the turbulence thus far in the stock and bond markets, six of 
the 10 funds were showing losses of 2% to 4% for the year to date through May. 
Masters of Consistency 
</P>
<P>
 These 10 mutual funds were singled out by Morningstar Inc. for avoiding any 
single-year losses over the past decade and for having the same managers or 
management team in place over that period. 05,17,17,09,10,11 Annualized Worst

TEAMSTERS OK NEW TRUCKING PACT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Teamsters have approved a new national trucking contract by an 81% margin, 
union officials said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 The union reached tentative agreement with Trucking Management Inc. on April 
28, ending a three-week strike. 
</P>
<P>
 It was presented for rank-and-file consideration without a formal 
recommendation from union leaders on whether it should be approved. The 
four-week mail balloting resulted in 67,784 votes being cast for the agreement 
and 15,729 against, the union said Sunday after counting the votes over the 
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our members have stopped the trucking companies from shifting good full-time 
jobs to low-paid part-time jobs," said Teamsters President Ron Carey. "This 
overwhelming vote shows that our members are proud of what they've won for 
themselves, their communities and for future generations." 
</P>
<P>
 Arthur H. Bunte Jr., president of the trucking company association that 
negotiated the agreement on behalf of 22 member companies, said he was "very 
pleased" with ratification. 
</P>
<P>
 "With the new contract in place, these carriers can now concentrate on 
regaining pre-strike business and attracting new customers," Bunte said. "By 
allowing the carriers to improve customer service, the new contract will help 
build a more secure future for the companies and their employees." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the provisions in the new four-year agreement is a $3.20-per-hour 
increase in wages and benefits over the life of the contract. Teamsters now 
earn an average of $17 an hour.

YOUTHS PUT SCIENCE CAREER PLANS TO THE TEST; EDUCATION: FOR 17 CONEJO UNIFIED 
STUDENTS, LABORATORY WORK AT ROCKWELL CENTER OFFERS HANDS-ON HIGH-TECH 
EXPERIENCE. SOME EARN A PAYCHECK TOO.

 Newbury Park High School senior Anita Chow decided two years ago that her 
future was in science. Already an honors student, she skipped her junior year, 
breezed through chemistry classes and enrolled in night courses at Moorpark 
College. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the 16-year-old is getting a taste of scientific research in the real 
world. 
</P>
<P>
 "At school you already know what the results are going to be," Anita explained 
last week as she prepared an experiment at the Rockwell Science Center near 
Thousand Oaks. "You're just trying to repeat it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here, there's a lot more hands-on experience," she said. "You tend to 
remember this stuff more." 
</P>
<P>
 Like 16 of her peers in the Conejo Valley Unified School District, Anita was 
hand-picked in February to work at the 79-acre, high-tech campus on a scenic 
hilltop at Lynn Ranch. 
</P>
<P>
 In a tradition that began 17 years ago, senior researchers serve as mentors 
for the budding scientists who take part in experiments intended to direct the 
future of Rockwell International Corp. The students' tasks range from writing 
complex computer programs to testing the clarity of liquid crystal displays and 
measuring the strength of ceramic material. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not just that they're here and they find something to do," said 
Rockwell's Paula Ross, coordinator of the Youth Motivation Program. "They are 
here to actually do research, to do work on a certain contract." 
</P>
<P>
 Sharif Nassar, 18, described his assignment as that of a "grunt programmer." 
</P>
<P>
 Each afternoon, the Thousand Oaks High School senior sits in a small cubicle 
writing a computer program that will crunch data from experiments on liquid 
crystal displays. 
</P>
<P>
 The data, printed in four columns of numbers, measure the length of time it 
takes for a display screen to fade from bright to dim. The purpose of the 
experiment is to develop dashboard or cockpit LCD displays that are easy to 
read from an angle or through glare. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem is really simple, it's just that my programming skills aren't 
always up to par," said Sharif, who plans to major in math at UC Santa Barbara 
this fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Sharif, other students described their work at the Science Center as 
challenging. In order to be chosen for Rockwell's Youth Motivation Program, 
students must have a strong background in science and math classes and they 
must aspire to a career in science, engineering or mathematics, Ross said. 
</P>
<P>
 Students also must maintain a 3.5 or higher grade-point average, though Ross 
said the participants have averages closer to 3.9 or 4.0. 
</P>
<P>
 "These kids know fairly early on where they want to go and what they want to 
do," she said. "They're pretty well focused." 
</P>
<P>
 The other students participating in the program are Cory Frobisher, Brett 
Juskalian, Jason Ko, Gwen Liu and Andrew Svitek from Newbury Park; Henry 
Childs, Mike Churney, Jill Dever, Renly Dutton and Stephanie Salm from 
Westlake; and Danny Yao, Frances Siu, Tony Chu, Phillip Hong and Rika Takahashi 
from Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Lois Conrad, who teaches physics at Thousand Oaks High School, said the 
students who work at Rockwell are typically at the top of their class. The 
experience, she said, gives them a chance to test their career ambitions. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's showing them if what they want to study is really what they want to 
study," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, many students are offered summer research jobs after completing 
the semester-long program, for which they earn $5.50 an hour. Approximately 40% 
of students return as full- or part-time summer employees, while six have been 
hired as full-time employees after college. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, the program has expanded according to the budgets of various 
divisions within the Science Center. 
</P>
<P>
 At its peak in 1986, the program employed 26 students. In all, 300 students 
will have participated once the current class graduates in a Science Center 
ceremony on June 14. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, for the first time, two spots went unfilled because none of the 
recommended students had the advanced computer skills required by Rockwell. 
</P>
<P>
 Conrad said she's afraid that trend may continue because high schools do not 
offer training in the sophisticated computer languages used by Rockwell. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, she said, even if the classes were offered, few honor students could 
squeeze the extra course into their schedules. To fulfill graduation and 
college requirements, most of the students have taken a full load of academic 
classes since freshman year. If they have taken any elective, she said, it's 
been band, because that also fulfills the physical education requirement. 
</P>
<P>
 Rika Takahashi, 18, who will attend Stanford University in the fall, said that 
taking a rigorous schedule at Thousand Oaks High has paid off by allowing her, 
finally, to earn a paycheck. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not only did I get a first job," she said, "but it was one that will help 
guide me the rest of my career."

OXNARD EXPECTED TO RAISE CITY CLERK'S SALARY BY $1,800; GOVERNMENT: DANIEL 
MARTINEZ THREATENED TO SUE WHEN COUNCIL SWITCHED FROM AUTOMATIC TO MERIT-BASED 
INCREASES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Oxnard City Clerk Daniel Martinez is expected to receive a $1,800-a-year pay 
hike Tuesday, ending threats of legal action and months of political wrangling. 
</P>
<P>
 At its meeting Tuesday, the Oxnard City Council will consider boosting the 
salaries of the city clerk and treasurer -- an issue that brought allegations 
of undermining the independence of those positions. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope that it brings closure to this issue," Mayor Manuel Lopez said. "But I 
think it was kind of a problem that could have been avoided." 
</P>
<P>
 Under Oxnard's system of government, the city clerk and city treasurer each 
wears two hats and is paid separately for each. 
</P>
<P>
 For their duties as elected officials, the clerk and treasurer have been paid 
$3,600 a year. The council is considering raising that pay to $5,400 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 For their duties as department heads, Martinez earns about $43,000 a year 
while Treasurer Dale Belcher earns about $53,000. Those positions used to get 
automatic pay increases until the officeholder hits the top of the pay scale. 
</P>
<P>
 But those automatic raises stopped late last year when the City Council voted 
to switch to raises based on merit. That decision only affected Martinez 
because Belcher already had reached the top of the pay scale. 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez was converted to a pay-for-performance system, where any raise was 
contingent on job performance. Martinez threatened to sue, arguing that the pay 
raise was guaranteed by city law. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, City Manager Tom Frutchey conducted an evaluation and concluded 
that Martinez was too inexperienced to efficiently run the clerk's office. 
Frutchey also recommended that Martinez's automatic pay raise be denied. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on that recommendation, the City Council denied the automatic pay hike 
in April but agreed to increase the pay for performing elected duties. 
</P>
<P>
 For Martinez, it amounts to less than the 5% that had been guaranteed under 
the old system. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Martinez said if the council approves the pay raise Tuesday, he will 
consider it a victory. He said he will drop his threatened lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 The fact that he will likely get a pay raise, he added, indicates that 
Frutchey's scathing evaluation was off the mark. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm still learning how to do things, but it doesn't help very much when a lot 
of the policies are not in writing," Martinez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard is one of only three cities in the county -- the others are Ojai and 
Fillmore -- that elect city clerks. Other cities appoint the clerk. 
</P>
<P>
 When the automatic pay raise was suspended, Martinez and his supporters 
expressed concern that the independence of the clerk's elected position could 
be undermined. 
</P>
<P>
 His supporters also accused Councilman Michael Plisky of opposing the 
automatic pay hike because of lingering rancor over Martinez's victory over 
former clerk Mabi Covarrubias Plisky -- the councilman's wife -- in the 1992 
election. 
</P>
<P>
 As the pay process was being reviewed, council members suggested that the 
council take another look at the ordinance that stipulates that city clerks be 
elected rather than appointed. That review is yet to be done. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Martinez and council members say they are hoping to put the issue behind 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's important that they (Martinez and Belcher) get this adjustment," 
Councilman Andres Herrera said. "I hope this puts the issue to rest."

STREET SMART

<TEXT>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 I have just returned from a driving trip to the East Coast. Exits, we found, 
were numbered in addition to being named. It was very easy to follow maps and 
find proper off-ramps. 
</P>
<P>
 Can we expect this improvement on California signs on interstate freeways? 
</P>
<P>
 Virginia Barrett, North Hollywood 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Reader: 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, you can expect exits on California interstate freeways to be numbered in 
the future -- but don't hold your breath. 
</P>
<P>
 Because numbering the exits would require a complete overhaul of Caltrans' 
internal system of marking freeways with "post miles" county by county, the 
primary issue is money. 
</P>
<P>
 "All our records are based on the system we set up 60 years ago," says Jim 
Drago in Caltrans' Sacramento office. "If we were to change, it would involve a 
total revamping of our record-keeping and everything that would potentially 
cost many millions of dollars." 
</P>
<P>
 So the project is on hold until money for a system overhaul is available, 
which will probably be when the federal government provides the cash needed for 
state transportation agencies to go metric, as the feds have pushed for years. 
Once that comes through -- which Drago predicts won't be earlier than 1996 -- 
Caltrans can convert to metrics and also adopt the federal post-mile system, 
which would allow it to start numbering freeway exits. 
</P>
<P>
 Interestingly, however, the state has made one previous attempt at 
exit-numbering, and in our own back yard here in Los Angeles, to boot. 
</P>
<P>
 Back in the 1970s, as an experiment, the California Department of 
Transportation numbered the exits on Interstate 10 from Santa Monica to San 
Bernardino. The exits were numbered west to east. If you look closely as you 
drive down the Santa Monica Freeway today, you can still spot some exit signs 
with numbers over them. 
</P>
<P>
 But public indifference and some hostility led officials to scrap the project. 
</P>
<P>
 "We basically received no positive reaction," Drago said. "What little 
reaction we got was unfavorable." 
</P>
<P>
 And anyway, Drago himself is slightly skeptical about the benefits of 
numbering exits. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's the difference between saying, 'Get off at Exit 60' and 'Get off at 
the Euclid Avenue exit'?" he asks. "Is someone going to remember the number 
more than the name?" 
</P>
<P>
 Your opinion, readers? 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 Can you please tell me why the on-ramp to the southbound Golden State Freeway 
at Roxford Street in Sylmar was originally closed and when, if ever, it will be 
reopened? There are many commuters who work in this area who are inconvenienced 
by this closure. 
</P>
<P>
 Stephen Adney, Sherman Oaks 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Reader: 
</P>
<P>
 Pat Reid, a spokeswoman for Caltrans, says the on-ramp was closed after the 
Northridge earthquake to make room for a bypass route that starts at the Golden 
State-Antelope Valley Freeway interchange a few miles to the north. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of earthquake damage, commuters must exit the Antelope Valley Freeway 
onto Sierra Highway before the interchange. The detour continues along San 
Fernando Road, then Sepulveda Boulevard, paralleling the Golden State down to 
Roxford. 
</P>
<P>
 At Roxford, the bypass route connects to the southbound Golden State. To do 
this, however, Caltrans has closed off the regular Roxford Street freeway 
entrance. 
</P>
<P>
 Reid says the on-ramp will reopen once key parts of the interchange 
reconstruction are complete, probably at the end of July. 
</P>

<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 Please explain the reasoning behind placing the traffic signal triggering 
devices within the crosswalk lines. On Yolanda Avenue at both the signals on 
Nordhoff and Plummer streets, this is where they are. 
</P>
<P>
 Cars have to edge forward into the crosswalk to trip the sensors, blocking the 
vision for drivers trying to turn right. What is the logic in this? 
</P>
<P>
 Cynthia Faulkner, Northridge 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Reader: 
</P>
<P>
 This is a classic example of the evils of impatience. 
</P>
<P>
 According to city traffic engineer Brian Gallagher, there are two traffic 
sensors cut into the asphalt at those intersections, one inside the crosswalk 
and one before the crosswalk line. The two are linked, so inching into the 
crosswalk to trip the second sensor -- as impatient motorists do to try to 
change the signal faster -- is unnecessary and only blocks the vision of 
drivers waiting to turn right. 
</P>
<P>
 But if that's the case, you might ask why engineers even bother to install a 
second sensor in the crosswalk at all. Why not just bury a sensor, technically 
called a "loop detector," before the crosswalk and leave it at that? 
</P>
<P>
 The answer traces back to human frailty again. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though state law demands that we stop our cars before the crosswalk at a 
red light, few of us can claim never to have broken that rule. So engineers put 
a second sensor in the crosswalk for those who exceed the line. 
</P>
<P>
 "We design for reality," Gallagher says. "We put our detectors where cars are 
most likely to stop." 
</P>
<P>
 This is not to cater to rule-breakers but to avoid greater dangers. It's 
possible that a small car could pass the first sensor altogether and stop 
within the crosswalk. Without a second sensor, the light would stay red, and 
crossing pedestrians would be forced to walk around the car into potentially 
busy traffic.

STREET SMART: A SIGNAL IMPROVEMENT AWAITS CAMARILLO INTERSECTION

<TEXT>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 I was relieved to read in a recent Street Smart column that the city of 
Camarillo is planning to upgrade the intersection of Pleasant Valley and Lewis 
roads. 
</P>
<P>
 Is there any chance that the project could include signals at the 
intersection? It's a scary intersection without them. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernice C. Nossoff, Camarillo 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Reader: 
</P>
<P>
 The city of Camarillo agrees that the Pleasant Valley Road-Lewis Road 
intersection could use a traffic signal. 
</P>
<P>
 So, they have included a traffic signal in their plans to widen and repave the 
roadway, says Camarillo traffic engineer Tom Fox. 
</P>
<P>
 The signal, which will include left-turn arrows, should be in place by the 
time the road improvements are completed late this year, Fox says. 
</P>

<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 In a recent column you asserted that drivers are not permitted to turn left on 
a red light. 
</P>
<P>
 That's true in most cases. However, there is an exception. 
</P>
<P>
 The vehicle code does allow drivers to turn left on red if the coast is clear 
and they are turning from a one-way street onto a one-way street. 
</P>
<P>
 Russell Chandler, Oxnard 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Reader: 
</P>
<P>
 Right you are. 
</P>
<P>
 Drivers may turn left on red from a one-way street onto a one-way street, 
provided there is no oncoming traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 For more information on rules governing left turns, call the city of Ventura 
at 654-7887 and ask for their free brochure on the subject.

 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 I am very concerned about the intersection of Conifer Street and Oakleaf 
Avenue in Oak Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost every day cars are parked all along Conifer and Oakleaf for baseball 
and soccer games and other sports events at a nearby park. 
</P>
<P>
 Trying to turn onto Conifer from northbound Oakleaf is a disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 Parked cars block the view of oncoming traffic in both directions. 
</P>
<P>
 Unless red lines are painted around these corners to prohibit parking, someone 
is going to get seriously hurt. 
</P>
<P>
 Please let me know if something can be done to make this happen. 
</P>
<P>
 Jennifer White, Agoura 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Reader: 
</P>
<P>
 County traffic workers will study the intersection to see if parking should be 
restricted, says Butch Britt, the county's deputy public works director. 
</P>
<P>
 "If a red line is a viable option, then yes, we can make the change," Britt 
says. "But we really have to look at why people are parking there and whether 
prohibiting parking would cause other problems." 
</P>
<P>
 Street Smart has forwarded a copy of your letter to Britt, who promises to get 
back to you as soon as county engineers complete their report on the 
intersection. BRIDGE CONSTRUCTION 
</P>
<P>
 As part of a project to replace three bridges on the Ojai Freeway, Caltrans 
has narrowed the bridge roadways to one lane and installed signals to control 
traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 The three bridges, all located in the Los Padres National Forest, cross Godwin 
Canyon, Bear Creek and the north fork of Matilija Creek. 
</P>
<P>
 The one-way traffic control will continue until the new bridges are completed 
next fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans is asking motorists to obey the signals and take extra care when 
crossing the bridges.

SOME OFFICIALS REGRET FORCING PLANNER STILES' RESIGNATION; VENTURA: 
COMMISSIONER WAS ASKED TO CHOOSE BETWEEN ADVISORY POST AND ACCEPTING A CITY 
DESIGN CONTRACT. COUNCIL VOTES ON CONFLICT-OF-INTEREST POLICY TODAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CONSTANCE SOMMER, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Two weeks after forcing a planning commissioner to resign his post in order to 
accept a city work contract, some Ventura City Council members say they made a 
mistake. 
</P>
<P>
 "We put the cart before the horse, basically," said Councilwoman Rosa Lee 
Measures, who made the original motion ordering Curtis Stiles to give up his 
commission post to be permitted to design a downtown plaza for the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Measures and Mayor Tom Buford now say city appointees should be allowed to 
serve on city committees while the city is paying them to work on a contract. 
Councilman Jim Monahan voted against Measures' motion last month and said he 
still believes Stiles should not have been forced to resign. 
</P>
<P>
 The council will vote today on what kind of conflict-of-interest policy 
Ventura should have regarding its volunteer commissioners, who staff advisory 
boards ranging from the Planning Commission to the tourism committee. 
</P>
<P>
 State law merely requires appointees not to use their post to lobby for city 
contracts or discuss or vote on a contract in which they have a personal stake. 
</P>
<P>
 Some council members, however, say they are worried not just about illegal 
conflicts of interest, but the public perception that city work flows more 
regularly to those with City Hall connections. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, the council will consider a policy that goes beyond state law to insist 
that an appointee resign to accept paid work for the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "If somebody is going to volunteer for the city, great, but then they 
shouldn't work for the city," said Councilman Gary Tuttle, who said he will 
vote for the more restrictive policy. Councilman Steve Bennett said he also 
favors keeping city appointments strictly separate from city contract work. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilmen Jack Tingstrom and Gregory L. Carson could not be reached for 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Stiles, the former planning commissioner, said he hopes the council decides to 
stick with the policy outlined by California law. He added, however, that he 
would not immediately return to the Planning Commission if the council gives 
the nod to the more lenient policy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've got too much emotion involved in this right now," he said. "I'll do it 
again, (but) some time in the future." 
</P>
<P>
 The brouhaha began last month, when city planners asked the council to approve 
a $25,000 contract with Stiles, a local landscape architect, for the redesign 
of California Street Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
 The area is now a cluster of vacant storefronts at the south end of California 
Street, next to the beach promenade and across from the Holiday Inn. City 
officials hope to renovate the plaza as part of an overall downtown 
redevelopment project. Plans include a new restaurant with outdoor dining. 
</P>
<P>
 Stiles has said he offered twice to resign his city appointments -- he also 
sat on Ventura's architectural review committee -- but city staff members 
repeatedly assured him that would be unnecessary. 
</P>
<P>
 But council members thought otherwise. After about an hour of debate, they 
said Stiles would have to make a choice between the committees and the 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
 "As of this evening, whether you say I have integrity or not, I feel 
humiliated," Stiles said before resigning from the committees, turning down the 
contract on which he had already started to work and storming out of City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 Profuse apologies from City Council members during the next couple of days 
finally persuaded Stiles to remain on the plaza project. Council members took a 
beating, however, from other city appointees who threatened to resign 
themselves and who spoke publicly of how such a city policy could prevent local 
experts from serving on city committees.

 But Buford said it was a closer reading of the law that ultimately reversed 
his opinion. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think everybody expects to do the right thing every time," he said. 
"After looking at all the rules, I changed my mind."

 Steady gusts of wind up to 15 m.p.h. were all the advertising Debra Barsy 
needed Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Moorpark artisan was selling dozens of her handcrafted wind chimes at 
ArtWalk '94, the annual Thousand Oaks arts and crafts fair that drew thousands 
of collectors and spectators to the Exxon Lawn along Hillcrest Drive over the 
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been the best show I've ever done," said Barsy, who was selling her 
cut-glass chimes for $10 to $80. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's the wind, but also the graduations," she said. "People just seem 
to be buying lots of gifts." 
</P>
<P>
 More than 150 artisans gathered along a meandering lawn for the seventh Conejo 
Valley Art Museum fund-raiser, a larger turnout than in previous years, 
organizers said. 
</P>
<P>
 The show featured a variety of media, including photographs, textiles, 
handblown glass and paintings. 
</P>
<P>
 "The crowds have been outstanding," said Patti Pawloski, one of the ArtWalk 
'94 coordinators. "It's getting bigger and bigger every year." 
</P>
<P>
 More than an open-air art mart, ArtWalk also handed out awards for 
craftsmanship and style. 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley furniture maker William Coleman was awarded Best of Show, which 
won him the honor of displaying his work at the Conejo Valley Art Museum 
gallery. 
</P>
<P>
 But Coleman was skeptical. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not sure I'll do it," he said. "It's a lot of work, and a lot of these 
pieces I already sold to other people." 
</P>
<P>
 Coleman said he sells very few of his pieces at shows like ArtWalk. "But a lot 
of people call me afterward and order stuff," he said, handing out flyers with 
his business' name and history. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks salesman Greg Fancon bought a bonsai plant for his 9-year-old 
daughter, Jessica. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's all mine, and I have a little figurine to go with it," she said proudly, 
holding up the plant and glasswork for inspection. "I'm going to water it and 
feed it all the time." 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Chen of Chino, who sold dozens of bonsai and other miniature plants at 
the arts fair Sunday, said the diminutive plants hold a near-sacredness in 
Asia. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're evergreen, and they take a lot of time to maintain," Chen said. "We 
like to say it's a means of good luck." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilma Monsalve of Thousand Oaks could not resist a pillow handwoven in muted 
Southwestern colors by Alicia Blackwell, a craftswoman from Bishop who 
maintains herds of goats and sheep as a source for her materials. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love the colors," said Monsalve, who plunked down $45 for the headrest. 
"There's a lot more things I'd like to buy, but I can't afford them." 
</P>
<P>
 Blackwell said she makes only $5 to $7 an hour for her efforts. But she does 
not do it for the money. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only way I can create more is if I sell what I make," said Blackwell, who 
was honored with second place in the textile category on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "My husband's a saddle maker," she said. "So he pays all the bills, and I come 
up with the fun money." 
</P>
<P>
 Chet Blacketer of Yucaipa molds sculptures out of iron. Sunday he was selling 
a series of old-time locomotives crafted down to one-twelfth scale. 
</P>
<P>
 "They take anywhere from a few hours to a year, depending on the piece," said 
Blacketer, who has set up shop at ArtWalk for most of the past six events. 
</P>
<P>
 Blacketer's artwork is a favorite of Joe and Jonathan Nathan, a father and son 
who live in Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 "We admire this work every year we come," said Joe Nathan, an environmental 
geologist. "We're Western (art) collectors ourselves, so we've picked up a few 
pieces over the years." 
</P>
<P>
 Business was not so brisk over the two-day show for Ben Brown, a New 
Orleans-based photographer visiting California for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a buyer from Thousand Oaks who invited me out here," said Brown, 
lunching under a shady tree behind his booth. "Most of my work is in galleries, 
so I'd never been to a fair like this." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown's work consists mostly of black-and-white nudes and colorful, 
mosaic-like images. But he didn't sell a print all weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's disappointing, and a little humiliating," he said. "But if compliments 
were money, I'd be leaving a wealthy man," he said.

THE LAST ROUNDUP?; CATTLEMEN FACE THREAT OF HIGHER FEES FOR USE OF PUBLIC LANDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Bill King's family has been raising cattle in the rugged canyons above Piru 
since before the 74-year-old King was born, before the dry and scraggly land 
was christened the Los Padres National Forest. 
</P>
<P>
 Although much of the land is government property, King has cared for it as if 
it were his own, building fences, clearing 20-foot-high brush, repairing roads 
and keeping an eye out for troublemakers. 
</P>
<P>
 "This business about the cattleman getting a free ride on the forest, the 
government land -- that's a myth," King said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the federal government wants to raise fees and increase regulations on 
cattle grazing on public lands -- a move that may drive up the costs of doing 
business and threaten the existence of one of Ventura County's oldest 
industries. 
</P>
<P>
 While the proposal has provoked the rancor of cattle ranchers, it has gained 
only tepid support from environmentalists. 
</P>
<P>
 Jay Watson, the Wilderness Society's regional director for California and 
Nevada, said the government is not going far enough to protect public lands 
from the damage that can result from intensive cattle grazing, including 
erosion and destruction of sensitive wildlife habitats. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot at stake," Watson said. "I want to see a balance struck between 
providing for ranching as a way of life to continue in the West -- because it 
is a part of the West -- and protecting the quality of what remains of the 
American landscape." 
</P>
<P>
 But the proposed grazing regulations, he said, are "quite toothless." 
</P>
<P>
 Even some ranchers agree that the precise impact of the government proposal is 
hard to decipher. "It's going to take a Philadelphia lawyer to figure this 
out," said Bud Botello, a 66-year-old rancher with a small cattle operation 
near Lake Casitas. 
</P>
<P>
 One thing is clear: The 15 Ventura County ranchers who have 700 cattle grazing 
in the Los Padres National Forest would see their payments to the government 
double over the next few years. 
</P>
<P>
 By 1997, the fees would rise from $1.98 to $3.96 per "animal-unit month," a 
measure defined as the grazing needs of a cow and her calf for one month. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill King has 300 cows, steers, bulls and heifers roaming the canyons at the 
lower edge of the forest near Lake Piru. 
</P>
<P>
 If all of King's cattle were grazing solely in public lands, his yearly fees 
under the new regulations would come to more than $14,000. 
</P>
<P>
 But half the land within the national forest boundaries is privately owned. 
</P>
<P>
 And King's cattle graze over a crazy quilt of property, with some patches 
owned by King himself and other large swaths owned by private interests such as 
Texaco Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the roughly 16,000 acres that King leases as rangeland, only about 10,000 
are part of the national forest. 
</P>
<P>
 And only 20% of the forest land is cleared enough to be accessible to cattle. 
</P>
<P>
 So King pays grazing fees for only about 25 cattle per month, based on a 
calculation of how much time per month his cattle spend on public land. 
</P>
<P>
 His fees to the government under the proposed regulations would double from 
about $620 to $1,200 per year. 
</P>
<P>
 Such an increase may not seem like a lot, but cattle ranchers say they are 
more worried about the possible hidden costs of the proposed regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the proposal -- which Department of Agriculture officials will decide on 
after public hearings this summer -- ranchers would pay a greater, though 
undetermined, share of the costs of protecting sensitive wildlife habitats that 
may be trampled by grazing cattle. 
</P>
<P>
 King, Botello and other Ventura County ranchers may, for example, have to pay 
to fence off sections of creeks that are known habitats for threatened or 
endangered species, such as the arroyo toad or the red-legged frog, said DeLoy 
Esplin, a spokesman for the U.S. Forest Service's office in Goleta, which 
manages the Los Padres National Forest. 
</P>
<P>
 And ranchers may also be required under the regulations to help pay for costly 
environmental reports monitoring the effect of their cattle grazing on the 
national forest. 
</P>
<P>
 Dan Macon, director of industry affairs for the California Cattlemen's Assn., 
said the proposed regulations would put an unfair burden on the cattlemen to 
maintain national forests that many other people use. 
</P>
<P>
 "He shares that land with backpackers, hikers, fishermen," Macon said, "and 
those people are not paying anything for the use of that land." 
</P>
<P>
 Environmentalists say the increased grazing fees and other charges proposed in 
the regulations reflect the true cost of raising cattle on public lands. 
</P>
<P>
 "Livestock grazing on public lands in some places is a tremendously 
destructive activity," Watson of the Wilderness Society said. 
</P>
<P>
 But local forest service officials say Los Padres has been spared much of the 
damage that grazing has caused in some other areas of the country. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point in the early 1800s, livestock ranching was the region's main 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Sprawling ranchos devoted to raising cattle and other livestock covered much 
of the area from Simi Valley to the coast. 
</P>
<P>
 Since a drought in the mid-1800s forced ranchers to sell or move most of their 
animals, cattle operations have been confined largely to remote areas, away 
from highways and encroaching development. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time the government took control of what is now the national forest in 
the early 1900s (creating the Los Padres National Forest in 1936), ranchers 
were already there. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County now has an estimated 45 ranchers raising about 10,000 head of 
cattle, but most are on private land. 
</P>
<P>
 And forest officials say they have monitored grazing in the national forest 
closely enough to prevent erosion or other significant damage. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel that the grazing is being done at a conservative rate so that it can 
be done forever," Esplin said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Rob Frost, president of the Ventura County Cattlemen's Assn., said that if 
the costs of ranching rise too far, many cattle owners who rely on public lands 
may leave the business entirely or quit using public lands. 
</P>
<P>
 That, in turn, would deprive the public of the improvements that cattle 
ranchers make at Los Padres and on other government lands, ranchers say. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're local residents who have eyes and ears that help to maintain the 
resource," Esplin said. "I don't look at them as damaging and destroying."

 Owners of waterfront homes in the Ventura Keys may have to pay more this year 
for the city to dredge their back-yard canals under a proposal going before the 
Ventura City Council today. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal would raise the annual assessment to $2,000, a $300 increase over 
the 1993-94 assessment. 
</P>

 In past years, notice of a fee increase has drawn many irate Keys residents to 
City Hall, where they have berated council members for considering raising 
their payments. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Keys residents plan to oppose the fee hike today, but they say a pending 
lawsuit settlement may negate the fee increase. 
</P>
<P>
 Under terms of the settlement, stemming from a lawsuit filed by nearly 
one-third of the 300 homeowners in the assessment district, Keys residents 
would pay $685 for last year and $749 for this year's dredging assessments, 
with an increase of no more than $64 per year after that. 
</P>
<P>
 Harvey Wilson, co-chairman of Save the Keys, a neighborhood coalition active 
in the settlement negotiations, said he plans to attend the council meeting 
despite the impending settlement. He said he will protest specifics in the 
engineer's report that calls for the fee hike. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to pay (our assessments) until those negotiations are completed," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The report states that the fees should increase to pay for repairs to the 
walls of the channels, future dredging costs, and the possible installation of 
a plastic liner at the site where the city dumps silt dredged from the 
channels. 
</P>
<P>
 Don Adams, a local attorney and Keys homeowner with a lawsuit of his own 
lodged against the city, said he too will attend the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 Adams said his lawsuit would push the city not just to lower assessments, but 
to clean up a barranca that feeds into the Keys. Adams alleges illegal dumping 
in the barranca causes the buildup of silt and other debris in the Keys.

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD, POINT MUGU; 205 GRADUATE FROM LA VERNE 
UNIVERSITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 More than 200 students of the Ventura County extension campus of La Verne 
University participated in recent graduation ceremonies, campus officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The number of graduates from the Oxnard and Point Mugu satellite campuses was 
the highest in their 25-year history, said Dorothy John, who directs the two 
centers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We opened our new center in September, 1991, and a lot of them have finally 
finished," John said. "This was an unusually big year. A lot of them were in a 
hurry to finish, and others had been at it a long time. It just all converged 
this year." 
</P>
<P>
 John said the 205 graduates represent more than 10% of the private 
university's Class of 1994. The commencement ceremony was held May 29 at the 
main campus in La Verne. 
</P>
<P>
 The 103-year-old institution offers bachelor's degrees, master's degrees and 
doctorates in a variety of fields but most of the curricula is geared toward 
working adults. 
</P>
<P>
 The most popular degrees are in business, John said. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's where the jobs are," she said. "Plus, the private sector is funding 
its students. So once they turn in their grades, they get reimbursed from their 
employers for the cost of their tuition." JEFF McDONALD

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: MOORPARK; SENIOR CITIZEN CENTER DIRECTOR IS HONORED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The director of Moorpark's senior citizens center was one of just three other 
Californians to be recognized last month by Gov. Pete Wilson for an Outstanding 
Older Worker Award. 
</P>
<P>
 Carol Ghens, 59, who began working at the senior center when it opened a year 
and a half ago, said the award was as much for the senior center as it was for 
her work as its director. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel the award is a measuring stick for what we're doing at the center," 
she said. "We have a fine program." 
</P>
<P>
 Ghens previously worked for 33 years at the Los Angeles Unified School 
District as a youth services coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
 The organization has made a reputation among Moorpark's 1,800 seniors for 
activities ranging from low-cost medical exams to country and Western dancing. 
</P>
<P>
 Gayle Wilson, the governor's wife, presented the award to Ghens at a ceremony 
in late May. Ghens received the award in the category of public service. The 
other awards were for work in business and nonprofit organizations. SCOTT HADLY

<P>
 A Simi Valley boy remained in critical condition at a Los Angeles hospital 
Sunday after nearly drowning in a neighbor's pool, authorities and witnesses 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The boy, identified by the neighbor as Joshua Smith, 4, was discovered at the 
bottom of a swimming pool at the home of James Neal, on the 1100 block of Royal 
Avenue around 5:30 p.m. Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Neal said that Joshua and his three brothers, ages 6, 9 and 12, were attending 
an impromptu swimming party at the Neal home with Neal's son when the accident 
occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 After several hours of swimming under Neal's supervision, the boys had got out 
of the pool and were toweling off when they discovered that Joshua was missing. 
</P>
<P>
 Neal, 39, said that when he found Joshua at the bottom of the pool, he dived 
in, pulled the child out and performed cardiopulmonary resuscitation on him. 
Simi Valley police believe he may have been under water for up to five minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Joshua was first transported to a local hospital and then transferred to 
Kaiser Foundation Hospital in Los Angeles, where he was admitted to the 
pediatric intensive-care unit. J.E. MITCHELL

COLLEGE WORLD SERIES NOTES / MIKE DIGIOVANNA; HORTON BIDS FOR WASHINGTON STATE 
JOB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 George Horton, Cal State Fullerton associate head coach, is one of 10 
finalists to replace the retiring Bobo Brayton at Washington State. 
</P>
<P>
 Horton, who guided Cerritos College to three State community college 
championships in six years before moving to Fullerton in 1991, plans to meet 
with Rick Dixon, Washington State athletic director, perhaps as early as this 
week, either in Omaha or Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cougars have reached the College World Series four times -- in 1950, '56, 
'65 and '76 -- and Horton believes the program has the potential to get back to 
Omaha. 
</P>
<P>
 "Like any other place, it's a good school with good facilities," said Horton, 
who will also apply for the vacant Florida job. "There's enough good players 
there to form a good recruiting base, so it just comes down to developing them. 
The only drawback is the weather (in Pullman) and how much you can stay on the 
field." 
</P>
<P>
 Horton, who has been primarily responsible for the Titan pitchers, has not 
decided whether he'll leave if he gets an offer. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's got to be right for my family and me," said Horton, who has three 
daughters. "Can we afford to live on one income? Is the environment conducive 
to raising a family? Is it a place I want to stay at for a long time? I don't 
want to move and then move again in three years." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Matt Wagner found out there's more to pitching that just throwing the ball 
Sunday night in the College World Series. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't cover first one time, and I didn't back up at home once," Wagner 
said. The Titans had a big lead at the time, and went on to a one-sided, 20-6 
victory over Louisiana State. But Wagner still was upset at himself for his 
mental miscues. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's probably part of the reason I came out of the game when I did," Wagner 
said. "That is just as much a part of pitching as pitching is. I started both 
times, but for some reason just stopped." 
</P>
<P>
 Titan Coach Augie Garrido said he felt Wagner was feeling frustrated at that 
point in the fourth inning after Louisiana State had scored five runs against 
him, four of them earned. Dan Ricabal came in to get the final out. 
</P>
<P>
 "That made it more difficult for him to stay focused," Garrido said. "If it 
gets too ugly, it's hard to bounce back from that. Matt had fulfilled his role 
and then Ricabal fulfilled his role." 
</P>
<P>
 Ricabal wound up winning the game. He pitched 2 1/3 hitless innings. Chad 
Rolish and Ted Silva also pitched in the late innings. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Dante Powell said Sunday his injured leg was the best it has been since the 
hamstring was strained against Oklahoma State in the regional championship 
game. 
</P>
<P>
 Powell was scheduled to be the designated hitter before the lineup was 
changed. 
</P>
<P>
 "It worked out well," Powell said. "It got Sal (Mancuso) back in the lineup 
and he got some key hits for us." 
</P>
<P>
 Powell went to the sidelines in the third inning, once Fullerton had built the 
big early lead. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Mike Parisi's pitching loss Friday was his first in NCAA postseason play. He 
won over LSU in the 1992 regional and then beat Florida State in the Series 
that season. He had a victory over Maine in the Central II regional last year. 
Parisi also beat Texas Christian in the Midwest I regional. "Mike pitched well 
enough against Georgia Tech to win," said Horton. Series Notes 
</P>
<P>
 There were 185 tickets sold to Titan fans for Sunday's game against against 
Louisiana State. Family members and friends of Matt Wagner bought the highest 
number among Titan players, 31. "I grew up a couple of hours from here in Iowa, 
so we still have a lot of friends and relatives in the area," said John Wagner, 
Matt's father. . . . The 24 runs scored in the four first-round games is the 
lowest number for the opening round since the 1975 teams scored only 21.

MINOR LEAGUE NOTEBOOK / ELLIOTT TEAFORD: BIRD DOGS CONSIDER RAVEN THE ANGELS' 
FUTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLIOTT TEAFORD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 He's considered the Angels' outfielder of the future. No, we're not talking 
about McKay Christensen, the club's top pick in last week's amateur draft. 
</P>
<P>
 Meet Luis Raven, who has established himself as one of the organization's top 
power-hitting prospects at triple-A Vancouver and made Angel General Manager 
Bill Bavasi wonder why he ever doubted him. 
</P>
<P>
 Since being moved up from double-A Midland, Raven is batting .370 (10 for 27) 
with one home run, nine runs batted in, four doubles and eight runs. He was 
named the Angels' minor league player of the month for April, batting .357 with 
10 homers, 34 RBIs, six doubles, four triples and 24 runs. 
</P>
<P>
 Even after two weeks in triple A, he continues to lead the double-A Texas 
League with 18 homers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Raven is making himself a hell of a prospect," Bavasi said. "I almost 
released him. We had him at double A last year and he was doing pretty well. 
But we were pressed to find a way to get (Mark) Sweeney to double A. The only 
way was to move Raven back to Class A. It really crushed the kid." 
</P>
<P>
 Raven, 25, from La Guira, Venezuela, batted .277 with seven homers and 52 RBIs 
in 85 games at Class-A Palm Springs and .257 with two homers and 30 RBIs in 43 
games at Midland last season. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has a lot of power and runs well," Bavasi said. 
</P>
<P>
 It may be a while before Raven is in an Angel uniform at Anaheim Stadium, 
however. Current plans call for Jim Edmonds, Chad Curtis and Tim Salmon to be 
the every day outfielders.  
</P>
<P>
 Bo Jackson and Dwight Smith will fill in occasionally for Edmonds. Curtis and 
Salmon rarely take days off. 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, Bavasi said Saturday that Garret Anderson probably will be the 
next outfielder recalled from Vancouver. Anderson is batting .332 with four 
homers and 37 RBIs for the Canadians. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Raven has impressed Bavasi and jump-started his pro career. And when 
the Angels needed to make room for Raven at Vancouver, the man they sent to 
Midland was none other than Mark Sweeney. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Quality evaluations for pitcher Greg Hansell continue to cross the desk of 
Dodger farm director Charlie Blaney. 
</P>
<P>
 Hansell, a 6-foot-5 right-hander from Kennedy High, is pushing for a promotion 
from triple-A Albuquerque with a 4-1 record and a 4.95 earned-run average. 
Finding a place for him in the Dodger rotation might be a little difficult, 
though. 
</P>
<P>
 They would seem set for the time being, but Hansell keeps earning rave reviews 
in his most successful pro season since the Mets drafted him in 1989. He came 
to the Dodgers as part of a deal that sent Hubie Brooks to New York in exchange 
for Bob Ojeda in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Hansell led Kennedy to the Southern Section 3-A title, defeating Saugus and 
current Seattle Mariner pitcher Roger Salkeld, 1-0, in a nine-inning pitchers' 
duel at Dodger Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Schooler always was a fighter, battling through an injury in a motorcycle 
accident his senior season at Garden Grove High to later land a spot as 
Seattle's closer. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mariners released him last season after he led the team in saves in four 
of the last five seasons. But Schooler won't let his pro baseball dreams die. 
</P>
<P>
 He caught on with the San Diego Padres organization this season, although he 
hasn't regained the form he once had in Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
 He is 0-7 with a 5.29 ERA in 15 games, including nine starts, for Wichita, the 
Padres' double-A affiliate. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Oft-injured pitcher Pete Janicki of El Dorado got his first professional 
victory May 13. Janicki, who broke his arm in his first pro game last year, is 
2-5 with a 5.40 earned-run average for Midland, the Angels' double-A affiliate. 
. . . El Paso outfielder Scott Talanoa, from Orange Coast College, has cleaned 
up by hitting seven of his nine homers this season at Cohen Stadium. It's 
tradition that fans in the front-row seats hand out cash to El Paso home run 
hitters. "I've made close to $1,000 so far," Talanoa told Baseball America. 
</P>
<P>
 Former Esperanza standout Tom Redington is batting .303 with three homers and 
26 RBIs for Lake Elsinore, the Angels' new class A affiliate. Earlier this 
season, the Storm had the second-worst record in professional baseball, but 
have recently crawled out of the California League's Southern Division cellar. 
. . . Philadelphia has apparently had their fill of former Esperanza and Cal 
State Fullerton standout Jason Moler at catcher. Moler was moved to first and 
third bases at double-A Reading. He has since been promoted to triple-A 
Scranton where he is hitting .325. . . . The double-A Texas League all-stars 
are scheduled to play a Mexican League all-star team in a two-game exhibition 
June 12-13 in Monterrey, Mexico, and San Antonio. Fernando Valenzuela is 
expected to pitch for the Mexican all-stars.

BULLFROGS' LAURIE STANDS UP TO BLADES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL ITAGAKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Roller hockey is supposed to be a high-scoring game, but goalie Rob Laurie 
flirted with a shutout for 44 minutes Sunday to lead the Bullfrogs to a 7-1 
victory over the Blades at The Pond of Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bullfrogs dominated the Blades before 8,653 in their Roller Hockey 
International season opener, and only a goal by Brett Kurtz with 3 minutes 53 
seconds remaining spoiled the shutout. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bullfrogs, the defending RHI champions, got key contributions from 
newcomers Yuri Krivokhija, Jim Brown and Colin Ward. Krivokhija had a goal and 
three assists, Ward had two goals and an assist, and Brown had two goals. 
</P>
<P>
 But Laurie was the big star, stopping 37 of 38 shots. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was 4-0 in the first half but it very easily could have been 4-4," said 
Brad McCaughey, the Bullfrogs' player and assistant coach. "Robbie stood on his 
head for us tonight but we can't expect that from him every night." 
</P>
<P>
 The Bullfrogs made it tough for Laurie by making frequent visits to the 
penalty box. The Bullfrogs were whistled for 11 first-half penalties, giving 
the Blades six power-play opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bullfrogs amassed 54 penalty minutes and the Blades 42 minutes. The 
Bullfrogs' Darren Langdon and Kurtz each received 10-minute misconduct 
penalties late in the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "We took some stupid penalties," Bullfrog Coach Grant Sonier said. "We'll 
address that in practice." 
</P>
<P>
 With his teammates in the penalty box, Laurie was up to the task, turning away 
19 first-half shots. 
</P>
<P>
 It got so bad on offense for the Bullfrogs that they went nearly eight minutes 
without a shot on goal in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 But when the Bullfrogs took a shot, they made it count. 
</P>
<P>
 Langdon skated free on a breakaway but Blade goalie Maxim Mikhailovsky stopped 
his initial shot. After Krivokhija couldn't score on the rebound, Bobby 
McKillop knocked the third shot past Mikhailovsky for a 3-0 Bullfrog lead with 
4:18 remaining in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bullfrogs had four players in the penalty box at one point, and only two 
players on the playing surface. Still, Krivokhija and Savo Mitrovic were two 
standouts for the Bullfrogs' penalty-killing unit, which gave the Blades fits 
all night. 
</P>
<P>
 "Penalty killing and goaltending was the key to victory tonight," Sonier said. 
</P>
<P>
 Victor Gervais scored the first goal of the season for the Bullfrogs, scoring 
on a breakaway during a power play for a 1-0 lead 2:34 into the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Then Ward, brother of King forward Dixon Ward, scored his first goal with 4:42 
remaining in the first quarter off a perfect feed from Gervais. 
</P>
<P>
 Ward's second goal came on a 50-foot slap shot that beat Mikhailovsky to give 
the Bullfrogs a 4-0 lead with 1:19 remaining in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown scored a goal in the third and fourth quarters to make it 6-0 before the 
Blades finally broke through. 
</P>
<P>
 "The shutout crossed my mind, that's probably why they scored," Laurie said. 
"Our defense played well tonight and on the penalties, they played it 
perfectly. Most of their shots came from the perimeter. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I'll save the shutout for a game when we only score one goal."

HYDROPLANE RACING; TATE WINS THE GOLD CUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mark Tate averaged 145.26 m.p.h. Sunday to beat Nate Brown in the American 
Power Boat Assn. Gold Cup final and end a three-year winless drought. 
</P>
<P>
 Tate won all five heats on the Detroit River, averaging better than 150 m.p.h. 
in winning the preliminary heats. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the first victory for Tate, who lives in Wayne, Mich., since October, 
1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, Tate had a spell of bad luck.  
</P>
<P>
 Last year, after setting a world speed record (170.087 m.p.h.) during trials, 
Tate blew an engine at the start of the Detroit race. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, there were no mistakes or mishaps. 
</P>
<P>
 For two laps, the boats driven by Tate and Brown, who was the crew chief for 
Tate and the Winston Eagle when they last won in Detroit in 1991, raced neck 
and neck around the 2.5-mile course. Then Smokin' Joe's superior power took 
command. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tide, driven by Brown, has finished second five consecutive years in this 
race. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Hanson, who took over as driver of the Miss Budweiser when Chip Hanauer 
was injured Saturday, rallied the team to a third-place finish (130.110). Miss 
Bud started as the sixth-place qualifier, meaning it had to start 15 seconds 
after the five others.

SHOP TALK: SMALL FIRMS ESCAPE FAMILY MEDICAL LEAVE COMPLIANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Do you have a question about an on-the-job situation? If so, please mail it 
to Shop Talk, Los Angeles Times, P.O. Box 2008, Costa Mesa, Calif. 92626. Or 
call (714) 966-7873 and leave a voice mail message. Questions of general 
interest will be answered in this column on Mondays. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Question: Does a person have to accept the Family Medical Leave Act's free 
medical benefits, where your employer continues to pay them while you're on 
leave, for maternity for example, or can an employee say "I don't want it 
because it will later cause financial problems in my company?" 
</P>
<P>
 -- M.G., Costa Mesa 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: If your company has fewer than 50 employees there is no obligation to 
comply with the Family Leave Act. The employer would be required to comply with 
the criteria established in the health insurance plan document. If your 
employer has 50 or more employees, the company would be required to maintain 
health care coverage under any group health plan for the duration of leave 
under the same terms and conditions as if employees had continued employment. 
Some employers require that active employees pay a portion or full premium 
costs for themselves or dependents. The same expectations may be requested of 
employees during leave time. Many group health plans have a stipulation for 
employees to allow a waiver of their option for health insurance coverage, 
which should be in writing. There may or may not be any extreme financial 
problem for yourself or the company. I recommend you meet with the company 
benefits representative and discuss your benefit choices. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 Question: Our company has been using a test that supposedly measures a 
person's honesty and propensity to steal. How good are these tests? I looked at 
the questions and it looks like someone could figure out the "right' answers if 
they wanted to beat the test. Is this true? 
</P>
<P>
 -- D.D., Fullerton 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: Recent research has shown that integrity tests are fairly good at 
predicting employee dishonesty and "counterproductive behaviors," such as 
chronic tardiness and taking extended work breaks. As you guessed, however, one 
problem with such tests is that a knowledgeable person might be able to "beat" 
the test, although actual instances of this would probably be rare. One 
potential problem with integrity/honesty tests is the same problem that led to 
the federal government's ban on polygraphs or lie detectors. This concerns what 
are called "false positives" -- truly honest persons who are erroneously judged 
dishonest by the test. The issue surrounding such employee testing is quite 
controversial. It you would like to read more on the subject, there is a very 
good recent book by Dr. Kevin R. Murphy of Colorado State University entitled 
"Honesty in the Workplace" (1993, Brooks/Cole Publishers).

HOT JOBS; DEPUTY SHERIFF LIKES TO INTERACT WITH RESIDENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANICE L. JONES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Tim Moy likes being a deputy sheriff because it gives him the opportunity to 
interact with the community, which he prefers to sitting behind a desk every 
day. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a people person and I like change. Being a deputy brings me in contact 
with the community and each day is different from the other," said Moy, 29. 
</P>
<P>
 Moy was hired by the Sheriff's Department at age 20. Like all new deputies, he 
spent more than a year working in County Jail, booking inmates and providing 
security. Even though he didn't find working in the jail particularly exciting, 
it provided Moy with valuable experience that he needed on the street. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was my first real contact with the criminal element, and the experience 
paid off when I went out on patrol," he said. "It's impossible to be naive 
after being around prisoners. I can't say enough about the quality of the 
training I got. The department tries to give us every advantage out on the 
street." 
</P>
<P>
 After several years on patrol, Moy became part of a Special Enforcement Team, 
patrolling neighborhoods in San Juan Capistrano on foot and sometimes on 
bicycle. Moy and his partner investigate petty theft, burglaries and settle 
neighborhood disputes. They also spend a lot of time talking to kids, making 
sure they are staying out of gangs. "They know we are around and that we care 
about the community," said Moy, who hopes to become an investigator. 
</P>
<P>
 An obvious drawback to being a deputy is the amount of stress involved. "It's 
especially difficult when you are called into a situation that involves 
innocent victims, especially children, since I have three of my own," Moy said. 
"But I have to constantly find ways to deal with it because if you don't, it 
can bring you down. You have to keep a level head and maintain a proper 
attitude." HOT JOB 
</P>
<P>
 OCCUPATION: Deputy sheriff 
</P>
<P>
 * What's involved: Deputy sheriffs are responsible for safeguarding the lives 
and property of citizens and to serve the needs of the community. They answer 
emergency calls, enforce traffic laws, investigate crimes and interact with the 
community. 
</P>
<P>
 * Qualifications: Deputy sheriffs must be at least 20 years old and U.S. 
citizens. The minimum education requirement is a high school diploma, but most 
have an associate of arts or bachelor of arts degree. They must be able to 
distinguish colors and their vision must be no worse than 20/80 and correctable 
to 20/20. Candidates must have no felony convictions as a juvenile or an adult 
and have received no form of probation. They must pass a written and oral exam, 
a physical agility test and an extensive background check. 
</P>
<P>
 * Prospects: One of the 10 fastest-growing job fields in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 * Outlook: By 1998, the number of deputy sheriffs is projected to increase by 
21.6% to 1,860 positions. 
</P>
<P>
 * Salary range: Recent Sheriff's Academy graduates receive $2,727 to $3,756 
per month. Experienced patrol deputies receive up to $4,300 per month. 
</P>
<P>
 * Pros: Deputies work in an environment that is always changing and provides 
community involvement. Many report satisfaction in being able to make a 
difference by protecting citizens, apprehending criminals and working to 
improve problem neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 * Cons: Deputy sheriffs often work evenings, weekends and holidays. The job 
involves a constant element of danger and the ability to cope with stressful 
situations. 
</P>
<P>
 * Advancement: Deputies begin their careers by working in County Jail, booking 
prisoners and providing security and transportation to and from court. Usually 
within two years, they advance to patrol level, where they respond to emergency 
calls and enforce traffic laws. Experienced deputies may join special 
enforcement teams or become part of an investigations unit. They may also 
advance in rank to sergeant, lieutenant, captain, under-sheriff and sheriff. 
</P>
<P>
 * Quote: "I patrol San Juan Capistrano and if something bad happens here, I 
get personally offended. I want criminals to stay out of my city." -- Tim Moy, 
deputy sheriff JANICE L. JONES

AIDS WALK LIFTS SPIRITS; SOME WHO CAME FELT IT WAS TIME TO SPEAK OUT, TO 
REMEMBER THOSE WHO HAVE FALLEN TO THE DEADLY DISEASE. OTHERS WANT MORE EFFORT 
TO FIND A CURE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID HALDANE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For years, Mike Carr had two big secrets. One was that he is gay. The other 
was that his lover of 10 years, Bill Moreno, had AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 Three months ago, when Moreno died of the disease at 50, Carr ended his 
silence on both counts. "I decided to tell everybody," he said. "When you lose 
somebody close to you like this, it makes you realize that it's time to speak 
out." 
</P>
<P>
 Carr spoke out in a huge way Sunday by joining the estimated 9,000 
participants in the eighth annual AIDS Walk Orange County. Sporting a snapshot 
of Moreno pinned to his T-shirt and a balloon saying "I Love Bill," the loan 
officer completed the 10-kilometer walk around the UC Irvine campus with his 
sister, Vicki, in just over two hours. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the end of the walk we're going to release the balloon up to Bill in 
heaven," Carr said at the beginning of the event, which organizers said raised 
about $500,000 for various Orange County organizations fighting AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 His party-like attitude seemed to be shared by most other participants. 
Pushing baby carriages, riding on roller-blades or leading dogs on leashes, 
they huffed, rolled and pulled their way along the closed streets and guarded 
sidewalks. They were loudly applauded by cheering sections waving red and gold 
pompons. 
</P>
<P>
 While volunteers handed out orange slices and cups of water, a fully costumed 
mariachi band marched along the route entertaining walkers. And a squad of 
Spanish-speaking karate students made the walk dressed in white karate outfits. 
</P>
<P>
 The day's serious purpose, however, was consistently evident in the banners 
and T-shirts carried and worn by many of the walkers, bearing the names and 
likenesses of people who had died of AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're walking in honor of our company owner's brother," said Dori Kagan, 
marching with a contingent representing a property management company in 
Orange. 
</P>
<P>
 Like others in the group, Kagan wore a T-shirt bearing a picture of Ronnie 
Herren, who died of AIDS last year at age 39. But she had a personal reason for 
being there, too. "I'm here with my four teen-agers," Kagan said, "because I'm 
hoping there will be a cure in case, God forbid, one of them gets AIDS. It's 
smarter than putting your head in the sand." 
</P>
<P>
 Craig Hitchman, 31, of Huntington Beach said he was participating in his first 
AIDS walk because, simply put, it was time. 
</P>
<P>
 "Too many people have died of AIDS and I don't think enough people have done 
enough about it," said Hitchman, a pharmacist. "In my work I see it every day; 
I've had patients who died." 
</P>
<P>
 And Kathy Compton of Mission Viejo said she was drawn to the event by the 
crowd. "I love it," she said. "I like seeing everyone being together to help 
other people." 
</P>
<P>
 Attendance at this year's AIDS walk was slightly higher than at last year's 
event, according to Joann Ruden, executive director of AIDS Walk Orange County, 
the nonprofit organization that puts on the event. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is great," Ruden said. "I'm really excited to have this much 
participation. We hear so much about poor economic conditions and people being 
burned out, but look at this outpouring of support." 
</P>
<P>
 Participants arriving at 8:30 a.m. were invited to take part in an interfaith 
religious service held at UC Irvine's Mesa Court Field. 
</P>
<P>
 Then came aerobic warm-up exercises, followed by opening ceremonies featuring, 
among other things, a performance by a Joan Rivers impersonator who joked about 
shopping and walking. "God I hate exercise," she told the crowd about to embark 
on a 6.3-mile jaunt. "If God wanted me to bend over he would have spread 
diamonds on the ground."  
</P>
<P>
 Those who completed the trek were treated to raspberry-flavored soft drinks, 
sandwiches and barbecued chili poured over corn tamales. 
</P>
<P>
 By then, Mike Carr's "I Love Bill" balloon was already long gone. It had 
happened during the second kilometer when a gust of wind suddenly blew it from 
his hand. Watching the balloon ascend slowly skyward, Carr shielded his eyes in 
disappointment at the premature launching. 
</P>
<P>
 He had intended to write a love note on it, he said; now it would have to be 
received in heaven without his comments. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh well," the young man finally concluded before resuming the march. "Bill 
always was impatient."

VIRTUAL REALITY TO A TEE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATT LAIT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Disneyland may be right across the street, but to many golf enthusiasts, a far 
more thrilling attraction can be found in a small, subterranean room of the 
Anaheim Hilton and Towers. 
</P>
<P>
 There, after the drudgery of convention meetings or taking the kids to local 
amusement parks, the average duffer can escape to a world of two-dimensional 
virtual reality and play some of the finest courses in Hawaii, Utah, North 
Carolina and Canada. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's incredible," said Scott Andres, 44, who was in town for an industrial 
hygiene conference. "I never thought I'd have the time to play golf on this 
trip." 
</P>
<P>
 But there he was, standing in front of a large video screen late one evening, 
smacking balls into a golf simulator while he was betting and drinking with a 
group of friends. In background sound effects, birds chirped and hecklers 
mocked his shots. 
</P>
<P>
 It's almost like jumping into a life-size arcade game. Participants stand 
about 10 feet in front of a 10-by-12-foot video screen showing 
computer-enhanced images of a hole on a real-life golf course. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the ball actually flies only several yards, the simulator's computer 
is able to calculate the ball's flight and distance. The computer then redraws 
the scene on the golf course relative to the ball's location and the flag pin 
on that hole. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just like being out on a real course," he said, "except I don't have to 
leave the hotel." 
</P>
<P>
 Patrick Hynes, spokesman for the Hilton, said the game -- which is among the 
first of its kind in Orange County -- is becoming increasingly popular among 
guests and is the latest "in hotel amenities." 
</P>
<P>
 In a city like Anaheim, where the competition for the tourist dollar is 
fierce, the golf simulator caters to the limited free time of conventioneers 
and parents. In fact, the toughest time to get tee times is usually between 5 
p.m. and midnight. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not trying to replace golf," said Ric Alessio, co-owner of Golf Centers 
of America, which leases the space at the Hilton. "We're just trying to fill a 
niche for people who are too busy to get out to a golf course." 
</P>
<P>
 Golf simulators have been around since the 1960s, but there are only a few in 
Orange County. In Irvine are two places, Indoor Golf Center and Swing Works, 
that have similar golf simulators and are popular among county residents. The 
one in the Hilton, however, appears to be the first attempt to capitalize on 
the county's lucrative tourism industry.  
</P>
<P>
 Recently, with advances in computer technology, simulators have become much 
more sophisticated and realistic. The Hilton simulator, which costs about 
$42,000, is similar to popular home computer games that also simulate the 
sport. Home versions, however, are simpler, using joysticks or keyboards and 
not real golf clubs. 
</P>
<P>
 Using the hotel simulator, a person can play an 18-hole round of golf in about 
an hour. The cost is $25 an hour for the first player and $5 for each 
additional player. 
</P>
<P>
 Alessio said he and his partner, Jim Higgins, have strived for realism in the 
game since they opened to the public in January. Golfers use their own clubs or 
borrow a set from the center and play with real golf balls. Different types of 
synthetic-turf are used to simulate fairway grass, rough and heavy rough. There 
is even a turf that simulates sand. 
</P>
<P>
 The sound effects are equally convincing. Balls are heard crashing into trees, 
splashing into water and dropping into the cups amid a gallery's applause. 
There's also annoying spectators who make remarks when a player lands in a 
bunker or hits a tree. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm getting a little tired of that woman telling me I hit a tree," said a 
frustrated Hynes, who was playing the game for the first time. "Can you turn 
her off?" 
</P>
<P>
 The simulator uses an elaborate web of infrared beams and a computer to 
accurately track a ball's flight. If a person has a nasty habit of slicing or 
hooking the ball, he or she won't be able to fool the simulator, Alessio said. 
</P>
<P>
 "What you do on the course is what you'll do here," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's a fantastic game," said Ron Cleveland, a member of the 
Professional Golf Assn. and former general manager and head golf pro at Indian 
Wells Golf Resort. "This is perfect for people who don't have a lot of time to 
get to the course or winter comes and the weather is bad." 
</P>
<P>
 Cleveland, who runs his own golf travel agency and is director of instruction 
for Golf Centers of America, said the game is not only good entertainment, but 
is also a valuable teaching aid because it measures the exact yardage of a shot 
and confronts a golfer with real-life golfing scenarios. 
</P>
<P>
 "The amateur golfer will be able to find out exactly how far they hit their 
driver or five iron or whatever club they use," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Additionally, the simulator can give a player an overhead view of the hole, 
show an instant replay of his or her last shot and show the impact of wind 
speed on the flight of the ball. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps best of all, a simple push on the computer keyboard can give the 
player a second chance at a shot, known to golfers as the "Mulligan." 
</P>
<P>
 The one area that the simulator lacks some realism is on the putting green. 
Generally, if a player gets the ball within 12 feet of the hole, the computer 
adds one stroke to the score on that hole, figuring that the next putt is good. 
</P>
<P>
 But as many golfers know, even a 12-inch putt can be testy on finely manicured 
greens. The computer can be programmed not to allow "12-foot give-mes" (as they 
are called in golf), but that can significantly slow down the playing time. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Hilton, four world-class courses are available: Mauna Kea in Hawaii, 
Pinehurst in North Carolina, Bountiful in Utah, and Banff Springs in Canada. To 
capture the realism of a particular course, thousands of photographs are taken 
and fed into a computer along with a course's exact dimensions. The program 
accurately reflects -- from every conceivable angle -- the position of trees, 
bunkers and even the pro shop on a course. To further add to the realism, Golf 
Centers of America sell actual golf shirts from those courses. 
</P>
<P>
 Players can even make up their own 18-hole golf course by selecting holes from 
the four available courses. 
</P>
<P>
 But for Ernie Clements, who was playing with several of his friends, Mauna Kea 
was challenging enough.

HE KEPT MORE THAN BOOKS, POLICE SAY; CRIME: A HUNTINGTON BEACH FIRM LOST 
$44,000, BUT THAT'S A FRACTION OF WHAT INVESTIGATORS THINK WAS STOLEN FROM 
BUSINESSES ALONG THE WEST COAST.

 The bookkeeper seemed almost too good to be true: He said he didn't need 
health insurance. He had references and more than a decade of experience. Best 
of all, he was willing to work for thousands less than other job applicants. 
</P>
<P>
 Donald Lee Peterson was a shoo-in. 
</P>
<P>
 "He appeared to be the perfect employee," said Celia Imperiale, the owner of a 
small manufacturing company here. "He said everything I wanted to hear." 
</P>
<P>
 Three months later, the unassuming bookkeeper with the button-down collars and 
a battered Chevy had vanished. And so, says Imperiale, had $44,000 from the 
company's accounts. 
</P>
<P>
 The businesswoman's frantic call to the Huntington Beach Police Department led 
to Peterson's April arrest on fraud charges -- and has helped unravel what 
investigators describe as an elaborate scam operation that preyed on 
small-business owners up and down the West Coast. 
</P>
<P>
 Peterson, 56, is now charged with stealing $360,000 from property management 
firms in Santa Ana, Westminster and Santa Ana Heights, in addition to charges 
that he bilked the Huntington Beach firm. He also is wanted on a $1-million 
warrant -- issued a decade ago by San Jose Police detectives who allege that 
Peterson stole $2 million from a dozen businesses during the early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 And detectives say they have linked Peterson to thefts from more than 20 
family-owned companies from Tacoma, Wash., to National City south of San Diego. 
Total losses: $5 million and climbing every week, authorities say. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's incredibly sophisticated," said Orange County Deputy Dist. Atty. Joe 
D'Agostino. "This guy is a chameleon. He knows when to move in, when to move 
out. This was his career. I've never seen anything like it." 
</P>
<P>
 Peterson, 56, is being held without bail at Orange County Jail. He has pleaded 
not guilty to four counts of theft filed in connection with the local charges. 
</P>
<P>
 His lawyer, Donald G. Rubright of Santa Ana, said Friday that he could not 
comment on the case because he didn't have "all of the information." 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecutor alleged that Peterson followed a familiar pattern to con 
small-business owners: Using an alias, Peterson answered newspaper employment 
ads and provided a false resume with fake references, and even bogus 
identification papers, such as driver's licenses and Social Security cards, 
D'Agostino said. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators said they believe that Peterson's accomplice, a man identified 
by authorities as Patrick William Finnigan, posed as a previous employer to 
supply favorable references. (San Jose police have issued a warrant for 
Finnigan's arrest.) 
</P>
<P>
 Once he got hired, Peterson would start writing checks to bogus bank accounts, 
D'Agostino said. And with the help of the accomplice, the bookkeeper allegedly 
withdrew the money by making almost daily ATM withdrawals. Bank records 
indicate that some of the stolen money went to buy gold bullions and other 
precious metals, the prosecutor said. 
</P>
<P>
 Peterson was arrested April 21 after Huntington Beach detectives had been 
investigating the report that the bookkeeper, using the name Michael Hammond, 
had stolen $44,000 from Nathan J. International Inc., Imperiale's Huntington 
Beach company. 
</P>
<P>
 Imperiale told authorities that she had done routine background checks on the 
man she knew as "Hammond." When she called his "current employer," a young 
woman put her through to the supposed owner who gave "Hammond" a glowing 
recommendation. 
</P>
<P>
 Peterson joined Nathan's 18-member staff in September. Imperiale recalled that 
he was punctual, brought sack lunches, and seemed very capable in balancing the 
company's books. But he was not very talkative and sometimes avoided 
socializing with the other employees, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Peterson has been described by police and victims as having distinctive 
physical characteristics: He is in his 50s, with thinning brown hair, 
stoop-shoulders from a hump on his back, a bulbous red nose, and a wart above 
his upper lip. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County district attorney's complaint alleges that Peterson pocketed 
90% of Nathan's cash receipts during a three-month period. 
</P>
<P>
 In December, on the day Imperiale's accountant was scheduled to arrive for a 
routine inspection of the firm's books, Peterson called in sick, she said. He 
never showed up for work again. 
</P>
<P>
 After discovering $44,000 was missing, Imperiale said she hired a private 
investigator and eventually ended up working with Huntington Beach Police 
Detective Jeff Nelson. 
</P>
<P>
 On April 19, a Wall Street Journal article detailed the fraud investigation in 
Huntington Beach, prompting the owner of a Westminster property management 
company to call police to report that he had recently hired a bookkeeper 
fitting Peterson's description. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent weeks, Nelson said he has been inundated with calls from 
investigators in Los Angeles, San Diego, National City, Santa Ana, Long Beach, 
Concord, San Jose and Tacoma. They say that they have been looking for the same 
bookkeeper, except that they know him by other names. 
</P>
<P>
 One investigator, Sgt. Ken Yules of the San Jose Police Department, said he 
has been trying to find Peterson for 10 years in connection with a dozen 
bookkeeper thefts involving $2 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said they found the suspect's true name after matching his 
fingerprints to federal prison records that show that Peterson was first 
arrested for fraud in 1954 in Wyoming. He subsequently served federal prison 
terms on Terminal Island in the 1970s and 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 It was there, investigators said, that Peterson met Finnigan, who also was 
serving time for illegal transportation of counterfeiting equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 Several business owners said they were gratified by Peterson's arrest, but 
still want their money back. Some said that the loss almost drove them out of 
business. 
</P>
<P>
 "The misery he's put me through, I'm lucky to still be around," said a Newport 
Heights property manager who spoke only on the condition of anonymity. He said 
he lost nearly $300,000 to his bookkeeper from October, 1992, to March, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Both D'Agostino and Nelson said the whereabouts of Peterson's money is a 
mystery. 
</P>
<P>
 "That tells how good he really is," Nelson said. "Even though he's been 
caught, a large part of the mystery remains unsolved.

TUTU LEADS CELEBRATION OF FREEDOM; RELIGION: SOUTH AFRICAN ARCHBISHOP SHARES 
HIS JOY OVER ELECTIONS WITH A PASADENA CHURCH THAT HELPED FIGHT APARTHEID. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu returned Sunday to a Pasadena church 
long active in the anti-apartheid movement to celebrate this spring's historic 
elections in South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are free, all of us! Blacks and whites together," Tutu told an overflow 
crowd at All Saints Episcopal Church, where many parishioners had supported 
boycotts and other tactics to end white minority rule. 
</P>
<P>
 Preaching from the pulpit during a festive morning service, Tutu noted the 
momentous changes in South Africa since his last visit to the church in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was here last, we were talking of the hope of something happening," 
recalled the 1984 Nobel Peace Prize laureate. "And now, a miracle . . . 
unfolding before our very eyes." 
</P>
<P>
 Tutu, 62, the archbishop of Cape Town and Anglican Primate of Southern Africa, 
is touring the United States for the first time since the April multiracial 
elections that led to the swearing in last month of Nelson Mandela as South 
Africa's first black president. 
</P>
<P>
 The cleric is midway through an 18-day trip that included a stop Saturday at a 
U.S.-sponsored investment conference in Atlanta, where he called on the West to 
provide his country with financial support. He will travel to Ohio, Illinois 
and New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Tutu has visited All Saints twice before, the first time in 1984, and his 
return Sunday was imbued with poignancy because of the support he has received 
from the church. Its rector, staff members and some parishioners have visited 
Tutu's archdiocese. 
</P>
<P>
 About 2,500 people crowded into the pews to hear him speak at two morning 
services, greeting him by clapping and singing, "I'm gonna lay down my sword 
and shield, down by the riverside. . . . I ain't gonna study war no more." 
</P>
<P>
 Tutu grinned and clapped in response as he stood under the arching wood beams 
of the Gothic-style church. 
</P>
<P>
 Churchgoers milling on the lawn after the service said they were astonished by 
the speed of the changes that have swept South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
 Brian Sellers-Petersen, who worked on South African issues for the church and 
the Episcopal Diocese of Los Angeles during the 1980s -- and who lived in that 
nation for several years -- said he once hoped simply that his children would 
see an end to apartheid. 
</P>
<P>
 "This feels like a full circle," he said. "I never thought I'd see this day."

BOARD TO QUIETLY END INTEGRATION EXPERIMENT; EDUCATION: TWO WESTSIDE SCHOOLS -- 
ONE MOSTLY BLACK, THE OTHER MOSTLY WHITE -- MELDED IN 1977. BUT PARENTS 
INCREASINGLY SENT THEIR CHILDREN TO MAGNET AND PRIVATE SCHOOLS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Late this afternoon, in the same routine stroke of the pen that will approve 
the purchase of pencils and books and suspend a janitor, the Los Angeles Board 
of Education will end a landmark experiment in voluntary school integration. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1977, with parents in the Los Angeles Unified School District bitterly 
divided over mandatory busing, two Westside schools came together to propose a 
solution that would spare their children from a cross-town bus ride while 
desegregating classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 Their solution was to link their two campuses, one mile apart -- one almost 
all white, the other almost all black -- as one school sharing an integrated 
student body. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents from the affluent, predominantly white Beverlywood area west of 
Robertson Boulevard would send their children to their neighborhood school, 
Canfield Elementary, from kindergarten through third grade. Their fourth- 
through sixth-graders would be bused across La Cienega Boulevard to Crescent 
Heights Elementary, in a more mixed middle-class neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Crescent Heights parents would follow the drill in reverse: Their children 
would be bused to Canfield until third grade, then return to Crescent Heights 
for fourth through sixth. 
</P>
<P>
 The pairing endured for 17 years, yet it has never really produced the 
integrated campuses that supporters envisioned. Today, the school board will 
formally cancel the arrangement, probably without discussion. 
</P>
<P>
 Crescent Heights attracted few white children. Canfield parents often turned 
to private schools when their children reached the fourth grade and faced 
transfer to Crescent Heights. Other Beverlywood parents eschewed public schools 
altogether -- particularly the newcomers, many of them Orthodox Jewish families 
who preferred religious schools. 
</P>
<P>
 And as the district expanded its magnet program offering integrated, 
specialized schools, many in both neighborhoods chose to bus their children to 
more distant magnets rather than attend Crescent Heights. 
</P>
<P>
 "Over the years, there was a smaller and smaller group of white parents 
supportive of the pairing," said David Shatkin, who sent his oldest child to 
Canfield and then to Crescent Heights. But he enrolled his younger child in a 
Baldwin Hills magnet after third grade at Canfield. 
</P>
<P>
 "It got to be a vicious cycle," he recalled. "When fewer white kids went over 
to Crescent Heights, the people who still had children at Canfield became more 
concerned about sending their kids over to a school with so few white kids, so 
they began looking at options earlier and earlier." 
</P>
<P>
 Shatkin and Marcy Frerichs were among a small group of white parents who 
recruited their neighbors to enroll at Crescent Heights. "It was the most 
frustrating situation because you had an ideal setup for integration to work -- 
communities that were fairly equal, the same middle-class working people," 
Frerichs said. 
</P>
<P>
 She sent her son to Canfield, then to Crescent Heights. But when her daughter 
got to Canfield's third grade four years later, "there were only two of the 
original 20 neighborhood kids who had started kindergarten with her." 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, the white enrollment at both schools dwindled. Although 
officials hailed the pairing as a model of voluntary integration, neither 
school now has more than a few white students despite substantial white 
populations in their neighborhoods. Canfield is 14% white and Crescent Heights 
is 7% white. 
</P>
<P>
 Only 10 white children from the Canfield area are bused to Crescent Heights, 
which has 17 whites among its 250 students. Crescent Heights sends 120 students 
to the primary classes at Canfield, but 95 of those are minorities. 
</P>
<P>
 Beginning in September, both schools will enroll students in kindergarten 
through fifth grade. For the next year, students now at Canfield or Crescent 
Heights can choose to attend either school. Beginning in 1995, students will 
have to attend their neighborhood school or apply to move through open 
enrollment. 
</P>
<P>
 For teachers and parents at both schools, the philosophical high ground has 
been superseded by the practical limitations that the system presents. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our teachers and parents feel it's an old concept," said Crescent Heights 
Principal Marie Kendricks. "The pairing is not doing what it was intended to do 
-- integrate the communities -- and it is depriving our school of the benefits 
of having the younger children on campus, things like the parental involvement 
the primary grades bring." 
</P>
<P>
 And an imminent reconfiguration of district schools meant that Crescent 
Heights faced losing its sixth-grade class to nearby middle schools, further 
cutting the school's enrollment. 
</P>
<P>
 For Canfield, the change will "bring back the concept of a community-based 
school and we hope that will attract some of the neighborhood families back," 
said Principal Sylvia Rogers. 
</P>
<P>
 The dissolution was supported by parents from both schools, but it was still 
wrenching for many who remember the sense of hope that the pairing generated in 
its earliest days. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a little bittersweet, but I understand it," said Frerichs. "I think what 
happened is it's run its course . . . not to say that's good or bad. For those 
schools, it probably isn't much of a racial issue any longer." 
</P>
<P>
 The school district's integration coordinator, Ted Alexander, said he is 
disappointed to see the arrangement end. "It was the only pairing of its kind 
that existed," he said, adding that the dissolution means that Crescent Heights 
will probably become even more segregated. 
</P>
<P>
 But school board member Mark Slavkin, who represents the area, said the 
pairing can no longer be considered a vehicle for integration. "I think there's 
a sense now of people saying 'let's be real.' We don't have any significant 
number of white students in either school anymore."

TOUGH GRADERS; L.A. STUDENTS GRILL 3 OF 5 CANDIDATES FOR STATE SCHOOLS CHIEF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Terrie La Vann, a sixth-grader at 68th Street School in South-Central Los 
Angeles, had a question Sunday for the people vying to become California's next 
superintendent of public instruction. 
</P>
<P>
 Striding purposefully to the microphone set up in an elementary school 
auditorium, the 12-year-old calmly faced the grown-ups sitting on the stage and 
got right to the point: "What can you do to increase our reading scores?" 
</P>
<P>
 His was the first of an hourlong barrage of questions from the ultimate 
education consumers -- public school students -- who got a last-minute crack at 
some of the candidates for superintendent in Tuesday's state primary. 
</P>
<P>
 An afternoon forum arranged by the advocacy group Children Now brought 
well-prepared youngsters -- and nary a softball question -- to the Carthay 
Center School in the Wilshire district. From fourth-graders to high school 
seniors throughout the Los Angeles area, they wanted to know what the 
candidates proposed to make schools safer, cleaner, less crowded. They wanted 
to know how they could get more computers, enough textbooks and better 
preparation for jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Zachary Markey, a sixth-grader at Pennekamp School in Manhattan Beach, wanted 
to know what the candidates would do about cutbacks at public libraries. 
Christine Jun, a senior at Los Angeles High School, demanded to know why 
students are sometimes passed along to the next grade when they haven't 
mastered basic skills. 
</P>
<P>
 And Mark Birnbaum, a junior at Palisades High, extracted promises from each 
candidate to step down if he or she could not fulfill campaign promises. 
</P>
<P>
 Submitting to the grilling were three of the five major candidates for the 
technically nonpartisan office: Joseph Carrabino, a retired UCLA business 
management professor and Republican former member of the governor- appointed 
State Board of Education; Maureen DiMarco, a Democratic former local school 
board member now serving as Republican Gov. Pete Wilson's education adviser; 
and Assemblywoman Delaine Eastin (D-Fremont), chair of the Assembly Education 
Committee and the choice of the powerful California Teachers Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Gloria Matta Tuchman, a teacher and political independent whose campaign has 
centered on her longtime crusade to end bilingual education and instead teach 
the children of immigrant families in English, was out of the state. Wilbert 
Smith, a conservative Republican who was a leader in last fall's ballot 
campaign to provide tax vouchers for private school tuition, canceled his 
earlier commitment to participate in the forum. 
</P>
<P>
 The students' questioning highlighted some of the differences among the 
candidates who did show up.  
</P>
<P>
 Carrabino, for example, said he would improve school safety by expelling 
troublemakers. Schools do not need more money, he argued, but should spend what 
they have more wisely. There are too many "special-interest groups trying to 
maximize their piece of the pie," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 DiMarco advocated greater decision-making authority for local schools and said 
she favors proposals to allow a community to raise taxes for education with a 
simple majority vote instead of the two-thirds required now. She also called 
for better community support for students and schools. "Students need 
continuous contact with adults who really care about them," DiMarco said. 
</P>
<P>
 Eastin provided a few fireworks by repeatedly bringing up DiMarco's link with 
an administration that she said has made prisons a higher spending priority 
than schools and has eroded education funding. 
</P>
<P>
 When DiMarco countered that per-child school spending has remained the same 
despite several years of recession-induced budget deficits, and that education 
funds have increased by $4.5 billion over four years, Eastin shot back. 
</P>
<P>
 "What do you see?" Eastin asked the student audience. In terms of cleanliness, 
textbooks and classroom crowding, "are your schools worse off than they were 
four years ago?" 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles High senior Nicole Quang said she found the exchanges "pretty 
interesting. . . . I've never been to anything like this before." 
</P>
<P>
 But Tony Zapeda, a student leader at Jefferson High in South-Central Los 
Angeles, said he didn't think the forum was worth his cross-town bus trip. "I 
felt like I was just talking to politicians" when he tried to voice his 
concerns about student motivation, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Schoolmate Sally Zuniga, however, thought the forum was worth giving up a 
Sunday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm interested in politics," said the 17-year-old junior, who hopes to attend 
the University of California after high school. Besides, she added with a 
candor not often found at political gatherings, "it's extra credit."

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: WESTMINSTER; TB VICTIM RETURNS FROM LUNG SURGERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Debi French, the 18-year-old student who contracted tuberculosis while 
attending La Quinta High School, got a warm welcome from a group of friends and 
relatives Sunday at John Wayne Airport after returning from a Denver hospital 
where she had a lung operation. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's in excellent health," said French's mother, Patti French."I'm very 
thankful." 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, 17 La Quinta students, including French, were found with active 
cases and another 175 had been exposed to tuberculosis. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, state experts on communicable disease visited Orange County to help 
local health officials address the handling of a new outbreak at the high 
school. 
</P>
<P>
 Health officials believe that 20 people -- two staff members and 18 students 
-- who were in contact with French between December and February, when she 
relapsed, have tested positive for TB bacteria. 
</P>
<P>
 In response to the renewed threat, the county this week will retest most of 
the Westminster school's 1,300 students and staff. 
</P>
<P>
 French, who has a highly drug-resistant strain of TB, was forced to have a 
part of a lung removed last month at the National Jewish Center in Denver. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Pattie French, doctors removed an upper lobe from one of her 
daughter's lungs. She said her daughter's chances of living a relatively normal 
life are good. 
</P>
<P>
 "The doctors said we can live without a lobe, and because she's young she 
shouldn't have any problems," the mother said. Her daughter's medication will 
be monitored by home health nurses five days a week.

 Three Irvine teachers have received grants that will be used to provide water 
education programs at their schools. 
</P>
<P>
 The grants were provided by the Irvine Ranch Water District and range from 
$100 to $500.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FOUNTAIN VALLEY; $68,000 GRANT TO BUY 15 SCHOOL COMPUTERS 
</P>

<P>
 Five Fountain Valley schools will be equipped with high-tech equipment in the 
fall, thanks to a $68,000 grant from the state Department of Education. 
</P>
<P>
 Fountain Valley School District received the school-based 
educational-technology grant for its Project TLC (Technology Links Curriculum), 
which is designed to improve learning in science and English, said Diane 
O'Donnell, principal of Urbain H. Plavan Elementary School. 
</P>
<P>
 The elementary schools that will benefit from the grant money include Plavan, 
Robert Gisler, William T. Newland, Roch Courreges and Fred Moiola. 
</P>
<P>
 The grant money will be used to buy 15 computers, with each school receiving 
three, along with software and printers. 
</P>
<P>
 Project TLC, which will begin in the fall, focuses on coordinating the use of 
technology with the science curriculum, O'Donnell said. Students will study 
scientific issues, such as acid rain and trash pollution, and conduct hands-on 
experiments, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 To supplement their studies, students will use technology by performing 
electronic research using a variety of software and laser disc programs. They 
will also be able to gather data by being involved in electronic networking 
with information sources across the country. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're going to learn their science much better because they're going to 
make connections with things they see in their everyday life," O'Donnell said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The benefit is they will retain their learning and hopefully have a lifelong 
interest in science and knowledge and an appreciation and desire to preserve 
the natural world." DEBRA CANO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: TUSTIN; COUNCIL TO CONSIDER A 2-TERM LIMIT LAW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN EYERLY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council tonight will consider an ordinance that would limit its 
members to serving no more than two consecutive full terms. 
</P>
<P>
 If approved, the ordinance would be submitted to Tustin voters in the November 
election. 
</P>
<P>
 Also on the agenda of the council session at 7 tonight is a public hearing on 
a proposed 223-unit condominium complex, which would be constructed adjacent to 
Tustin Ranch Golf Course. 
</P>
<P>
 City staff is recommending approval of the condominiums, which would be built 
on a 14.6-acre site. According to staff members, the project meets the 
requirements of the East Tustin Specific Plan. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council is also scheduled to discuss whether the city's smoking 
ordinance needs to be updated. The ordinance, which was enacted in 1985, 
prohibits smoking in enclosed public places and places of employment, except in 
designated smoking areas. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of the discussion, council members are expected to review smoking 
ordinances approved in recent years by the cities of Anaheim, Dana Point and 
Irvine. ALAN EYERLY

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA ANA; LAND PURCHASE FOR SCIENCE CENTER OKD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A proposed Discovery Science Center has moved one step closer to reality with 
the City Council's recent agreement to buy five acres of unused Caltrans land 
and give it to the center. 
</P>
<P>
 The council has promised to negotiate for the property north of the Santa Ana 
Freeway, just west of Main Street, said Bob Hoffman, the city's redevelopment 
and real estate manager.He said Caltrans has agreed to hold the land for 18 
months until the city can purchase it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm thrilled," Karen Johnson, executive director of Discovery Science Center, 
said. "The freeway visibility (will make) it much easier for us to be 
identified and our location known." 
</P>
<P>
 The center is expected to open in 1997 and will provide 76,000 square feet of 
interactive science exhibits, as well as an IMAX theater. It will cost about 
$19 million to build and is expected to draw more than 600,000 visitors 
annually. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson said the center hopes to use a portion of the Caltrans land as a 
parking lot and turn a furniture store building next door into the actual 
exhibit hall. She said lease arrangements for the building should be completed 
shortly. 
</P>
<P>
 The center originally had been planned for a site on Main Street south of the 
freeway, next to Bowers Museum of Cultural Art. That land, however, was more 
expensive, Johnson said, and did not offer as much exposure to freeway 
commuters. LYNN FRANEY

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FOUNTAIN VALLEY; COOK TO STOP GIVING CHILD ABUSE TALKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBRA CANO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Laurann Cook is giving up her teaching role after 11 years of presenting a 
program on the dangers of molestation, abuse and abduction to city 
schoolchildren. 
</P>
<P>
 Cook, a City Council member, gave her last presentations of the city-sponsored 
Child Abuse Resistance Education (CARE) program Thursday to classes of third- 
and fifth-graders at Roch Courreges Elementary School. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the past decade, Cook has spent more than 400 hours a year talking to 
tens of thousands of youngsters in kindergarten through eighth grade. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have put in so much time, love and devotion, it will be hard to leave," she 
said. "Eleven years is a long time, but I have never regretted one moment or 
begrudged the time I have given to it. I feel it's time to move on to other 
commitments." 
</P>
<P>
 Cook said no one has stepped forward to replace her and is hoping another 
volunteer will take over the program. But if a replacement is not found by the 
next school year, she will continue to teach until someone else takes over, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cook, who is married and has two daughters, founded the program in 1983 after 
becoming alarmed by the number of child abuse and molestation cases in the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't a topic that was addressed. It was a closet issue," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cook received support from Fountain Valley, Ocean View and Garden Grove 
Unified school districts to teach the course in their schools. Today she 
reaches more than 5,000 children annually with the program. 
</P>
<P>
 "The program is about educating children of the community on how to stay 
safe," she said. Cook's message to her pupils: "You keep telling someone until 
you're believed. And remember, if you're ever a victim, it's never your fault." 
</P>
<P>
 The program is presented in schools with the cooperation and participation of 
the Police Department. Officers make the presentations with Cook at the city's 
15 public schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Officer Jim Manton, one of seven officers involved, said creating awareness 
about molestation and abuse is important. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think the topic is discussed at home and it needs to be brought up by 
someone," he said. The program provides a way in which children can confide in 
someone and seek help, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 One year Cook referred 20 reports of abuse, she said, though in other years 
she has fielded fewer complaints that merited her contacting authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 Since she originated the program, a number of arrests have grown from these 
presentations, though most often she does not know what happens after she files 
a report with the authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes a child might listen to the presentation, she said, but not decide 
to talk to a teacher about it until later. 
</P>
<P>
 "They really need the encouragement . . . that it's OK to tell," Manton said. 
</P>
<P>
 Teachers also consider the program valuable. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the kind of thing that is uncomfortable for kids to talk about," said 
Linda Shea, a fifth-grade teacher at Courreges. "(The program) brings it up to 
an awareness level where a student would get the nerve to tell someone about 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 The program, however, has required a large commitment of time and energy, 
which Cook says she no longer can give. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have done it because I genuinely care for children," she said. DEBRA CANO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LOS ALAMITOS; PANEL TO EXAMINE PROGRAMS AT SCHOOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A panel of teachers, parents, students and school administrators will meet 
Tuesday to review programs offered to students at Los Alamitos High School. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents are encouraged to attend the 7 p.m. meeting of the School Site Council 
at the school's media center and present ideas on how to improve current school 
programs or decide what new ones to adopt. 
</P>
<P>
 "If parents want to influence the school, they should come and be active 
participants," said Brian McEvoy, who co-chairs the 20-member council. 
</P>
<P>
 McEvoy said the council updates and approves the School Site Plan, which 
contains the school's goals and objectives over a number of years. The advisory 
panel meets four times a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Alamitos High School, which currently has more than 2,400 students, was 
honored last year as one of the nation's best schools. 
</P>
<P>
 But since 1993, there has been racial tension at the school. That year, white 
supremacist flyers were found stuffed in student lockers. The police have 
investigated but so far no one has been arrested. 
</P>
<P>
 "The issue is still a hot one and will come up in the School Site Council 
meeting," McEvoy said. 
</P>
<P>
 To deal with the issue and raise consciousness about it, the school has had 
speakers on racial tolerance and cultural diversity, and the students have 
discussed the subject at club meetings and in the classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 A computer consultant for a Cypress company, McEvoy has a son at Los Alamitos 
High School. He has been on the School Site Council for two years, and this 
year shares the chairmanship with Pat Ramsburg, a Los Alamitos High teacher.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; POOL RULE ONLY A MATTER OF DEFINITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BILLITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Have we got trouble? Right here in Ocean City? 
</P>
<P>
 Well, it starts with "P," as in pool, but it doesn't rhyme with "T," as in 
trouble, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pool and billiard halls are the subject of an ordinance that is scheduled to 
be introduced today, but City Administrator Michael T. Uberuaga said it's not 
that they're a problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't have any trouble," Uberuaga said. "It's just because the city needed 
a (legal) definition." 
</P>
<P>
 Existing city law governs pool and billiard halls but fails to define them. 
</P>
<P>
 The ordinance will define any business with four or more pool or billiard 
tables as a pool or billiard hall. 
</P>
<P>
 Why four? City Atty. Gail C. Hutton, in a memo to the council, said the number 
four was picked because another city law, governing game arcades, defines them 
as being any place with more than four commercially operated amusement devices.

 Plans for a fourth attempt to make a success of an abandoned restaurant 
building on Marguerite Parkway will be brought to the Planning Commission 
tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 Two restaurant concepts at the 10,700-square-foot building, at 28471 
Marguerite Parkway, have failed and the third couldn't win approval from the 
Planning Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest plan -- a proposed non-alcoholic dance club aimed at the 
younger-than-21 crowd -- is backed by Kathy Petrasich and Les Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 To be called Shout West, the nightclub would feature about 80% recorded dance 
music and fill the rest of its opening hours with live acts. 
</P>
<P>
 There are currently no plans for restaurant service and bar drinks would be 
limited to soda, flavored seltzers, spring waters and non-alcoholic mixed 
drinks. Billiard tables are also planned for the dance club. 
</P>
<P>
 City staff is recommending that patrons be limited to 275 persons in the late 
afternoon with a peak of 600 people between 9 p.m. and 2 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 City planners also want the issue to be delayed until the Planning 
Commission's June 20 meeting. City personnel and police say they need the time 
to further study traffic and crowd control issues. 
</P>
<P>
 The building was originally the home of Bobby McGee's before it closed in 
1990, reopening about a year later as Sauces Restaurant. The site has been 
vacant since Sauces closed in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, an applicant wanted to convert the building into a country-Western 
restaurant/nightclub called Cadillac Cowboy. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the permit was denied by the commission when a background check found 
that the proposed owner had an arrest record that wasn't disclosed on his 
application. FRANK MESSINA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FULLERTON; ONWARD, UPWARD WITH BETTER ENGLISH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Gabriela Rodriguez is jobless, but she doesn't want to take the only kind of 
employment she can find -- back-breaking assembly-line work. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had a job in a factory where I sewed garments on a sewing machine all day," 
Rodriguez said in Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was hard work. My body always ached." 
</P>
<P>
 The 23-year-old Fullerton woman, who emigrated from Mexico six years ago, has 
decided it is time to learn English so she can seek a higher paying and less 
physically demanding job. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodriguez and about 100 other people with the same commitment attended their 
first English classes Saturday and Sunday at Jimmy Ramos' home on Truslow 
Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramos and six other college students conducted the classes on his driveway, 
which they converted into two classrooms -- one for beginners and another for 
more advanced students. 
</P>
<P>
 The teachers used donated books, paper and chalkboards to deliver their first 
free lessons to neighbors and people who came from all over Orange and Los 
Angeles counties. 
</P>
<P>
 So many eager students had lined up before class started at 9 a.m. that Ramos 
had to run door-to-door in his neighborhood to borrow chairs. 
</P>
<P>
 He got a rocking chair, picnic benches, plastic lawn seats, a beat-up wooden 
school chair and a couch for his students to sit on. 
</P>
<P>
 Blue plastic awnings provided shade for the make-shift classrooms, where Glo 
Morris, a Fullerton College student, and Javier Cortez, a Cal State Fullerton 
student, taught the correct pronunciation for the words flag, post office and 
doctor's appointment and for some conversational phrases. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Josue Abarca and Alberto Ortega, both Fullerton College students, 
held a chalkboard displaying forms of 10 verbs. 
</P>
<P>
 "For homework, I want you to write one sentence for each verb," Abarca 
instructed. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramos went from student to student, offering individual help to those who 
needed extra tutoring. 
</P>
<P>
 "So many people want and need to learn English," Ramos said. "I haven't seen 
many programs that give English classes on the weekends so we're doing this to 
help people who cannot afford to go to school or who work during the week and 
don't have a lot of time." 
</P>
<P>
 As class concluded Saturday afternoon, grateful students thanked their 
teachers and some offered to bring chairs, chalk and pencils to their new 
school on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "What these teachers are doing is a great labor of love," said Naomi 
Guitierrez, 33, of Orange. "They are young college kids who could easily be 
spending their time doing something else but, instead, they're helping us learn 
English." 
</P>
<P>
 Another student, Pedro Rodriguez, 40, said he will drive from his Fontana home 
every weekend to attend his new class because he needs to learn English. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now I work the graveyard shift as a security guard," he said. "If I 
learn how to write and read English, then I can get a better job. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know anybody else who offers classes like this," he added. "It 
doesn't matter that this is not a luxurious building because we the students 
will benefit." 
</P>
<P>
 The volunteer teachers said they will continue offering the classes to help 
the Latino community prosper. 
</P>
<P>
 Adela G. Lopez, Fullerton College's Ethnic Studies Program coordinator, and 
Elisabeth Leyson, the college's English department chairwoman, said they were 
impressed by the students' work. 
</P>
<P>
 "With all the immigrant bashing going on today, this is a terrific program 
that shows that we can help ourselves," Lopez said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Programs like these are available, but they are (overcrowded) and the state 
keeps cutting back, so it's nice to see students, who see a need, respond to 
it," Leyson added. MIMI KO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAGUNA BEACH; WATER DISTRICT TO PAY FOR OPEN SPACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Laguna Beach may soon realize the first tangible advantage of a recent City 
Council decision to let the local water district build a 3-million-gallon 
reservoir in the Top of the World neighborhood. And it's not water. 
</P>
<P>
 The city will get somewhere between $174,000 and $550,000 for land from the 
Laguna Beach County Water District after a long and controversial battle. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the reservoir site is environmentally sensitive, the city will use the 
money from the water district to buy a substitute piece of land for open space, 
17.5 acres in the Canyon Acres area. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, the council will consider appropriating funds to proceed with the 
purchase. 
</P>
<P>
 The Canyon Acres property is being sold by Richard Massen for $102,000, and 
$5,000 would be spent for escrow costs, according to a memo to the council from 
Deputy City Manager Rob Clark. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement with the water district was controversial partly because the 
water tank will be placed on a knoll some have considered environmentally 
sensitive. The Canyon Acres land is considered "replacement open space," 
according Clark's memo. 
</P>
<P>
 Located on a private section of Canyon Acres Drive, most of the land is steep 
and is not zoned for development. The purchase, however, would ensure that the 
land is preserved as open space, the memo says. 
</P>
<P>
 The Open Space Commission unanimously recommended that the city purchase the 
land during its meeting last week. 
</P>
<P>
 The reservoir was the subject of fierce political dispute as a council 
majority could never reach a consensus on the plan. The water district took 
legal action for the right to build the tank. 
</P>
<P>
 After a firestorm swept through Laguna Beach on Oct. 27, many people who lost 
homes blamed the council majority for failing to allow the reservoir they 
believed could have saved some homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, the council agreed to the reservoir plan. 
</P>
<P>
 The council will meet at 6 p.m. Tuesday at City Hall, 505 Forest Ave. LESLIE

BEACH BRAWL COSTS MAN PART OF NOSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATT LAIT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A dogfight at Bolsa Chica State Beach erupted into a brawl between two groups 
of beach-goers, leaving four people with minor injuries and one young man with 
part of his nose bitten off, police said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Huntington Beach Lt. Luis Ochoa said the fight erupted about 5:15 p.m. 
Saturday when a group of beach-goers tried to protect their Rottweiler, which 
was being attacked by two pit bulls. 
</P>
<P>
 The owners of the pit bulls and their friends -- a total of five males -- 
became angry with the group protecting the Rottweiler and started a fistfight, 
Ochoa said. During the course of the nearly 10-minute fight an 18-year-old man 
from Huntington Beach had a portion of his nose bitten off by someone, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He was taken to UCI Medical Center in Orange by his friends, among them the 
owners of the pit bulls. He is considered a suspect in the beach assault, Ochoa 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 The pit bulls' owners and their friends had gone by the time lifeguards and 
police arrived. Three men and one woman from the other group -- from Los 
Angeles and San Diego counties -- were treated at the scene for minor cuts, 
bruises and abrasions, Ochoa said. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators have not made any arrests. "It's pending further investigation," 
said Ochoa, who declined to release the name of the man with the injured nose. 
He added that authorities don't know who did the biting. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the participants in the brawl, Ochoa said, the dogs were unharmed.

TRAIN KILLS GIRL, AN APPARENT SUICIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 16-year-old girl was struck and killed by a train late Saturday in what 
coroners' investigators said was the third apparent suicide on Orange County 
railroad tracks in the past four weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Cecilia Pacheco of Anaheim walked in front of an Orange County Metrolink train 
near South Cypress Street in Anaheim about 9 p.m., authorities said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Police had no further details and officials of the Orange County 
Transportation Authority could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 On May 12, a 28-year-old man, apparently distraught over a breakup with his 
girlfriend, backed his car onto railroad tracks in Laguna Niguel. 
</P>
<P>
 A few days earlier in Irvine, a 17-year-girl from that city dived onto 
railroad tracks in front of an Amtrak train in another suicide.

POLICE ARREST DRIVER AFTER HIGH-SPEED, 3-COUNTY CHASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID REYES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 39-year-old transient driving a vehicle reported as stolen hit speeds of 120 
m.p.h. during a 70-mile police chase Sunday through Los Angeles, Orange and San 
Bernardino counties. 
</P>
<P>
 Gregory Williams was finally taken into custody on suspicion of felony evading 
arrest and vehicle theft after he blew a tire at the Archibald Avenue off-ramp 
on the San Bernardino Freeway in Ontario, California Highway Patrol Sgt. Roman 
Vondriska said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was using all lanes of the freeways," Vondriska said. "At times he was on 
the shoulder, then on the center divider. Luckily no one was injured during the 
chase and there were no accidents." 
</P>
<P>
 The 40-minute chase began about 2:45 p.m. in Placentia and involved numerous 
police agencies in Orange, Los Angeles and San Bernardino counties and two 
police helicopters. 
</P>
<P>
 The vehicle was reported stolen May 23 in the Los Angeles County city of 
Walnut, Vondriska said. 
</P>
<P>
 The suspect first evaded Placentia police and then got on the Riverside 
Freeway headed east, Vondriska said. He then allegedly moved onto the Orange 
Freeway and then the Garden Grove Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, Vondriska said, Williams changed freeways again, getting on the San 
Diego Freeway in Los Alamitos, then headed north on the San Gabriel River 
Freeway. Finally, he reportedly entered the San Bernardino Freeway eastbound 
and was stopped in Ontario. 
</P>
<P>
 In Ontario at Archibald, Vondriska said Williams blew a tire and was driving 
on the wheel rim. Williams was caught at about 3:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 "He lost it on the wheel rim when he tried to make a turn to get off the 
freeway," Vondriska said. "He lost control and the vehicle just came to a 
stop." 
</P>
<P>
 The suspect did not say why he failed to stop for police, Vondriska said.

WORLD CUP '94 / 11 DAYS AND COUNTING; PRODIGAL SON RETURNS HOME; DIEGO MARADONA 
HAS HAD A CHECKERED PAST, BUT HOPES TO RELIVE GLORY DAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 He is running -- darting, really -- in his characteristic manner: Head up, 
chest thrust out, elbows back, thick legs pumping. Oozing arrogance and cunning 
and verve and utterly willing to do whatever he must. 
</P>
<P>
 Other players will come into the frame, cleats first, and slash at his lower 
legs. He will always be tumbling to the ground. But he will get up and coax a 
curving left-footed free kick into the far upper corner of the net. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the way we see Diego Maradona when we think of him. His is not 33 
years old. We recall him in his prime, in the 1986 World Cup when he was at all 
times the best player on the field. Opposing players confessed they had moments 
during a game when they lost track of their own duties and simply watched 
Maradona operate. 
</P>
<P>
 No one will care to recall the bloated and out of shape Maradona loitering in 
the midfield, the Maradona being led away by police after his arrest on drug 
charges, the insufferable egoist who claims the great Pele is jealous of his 
skills. 
</P>
<P>
 Which picture of Elvis do The King's fans keep on permanent file in their 
mind's eye? 
</P>
<P>
 Which Maradona will we see take the field -- if at all -- when Argentina plays 
Greece on June 21 in their first World Cup match? Would it have been better for 
the best player of his generation to have truly quit one of the scores of times 
he claimed to? Or will Maradona, the most diabolical of players, pull off 
another of his miracles and in his new sleek incarnation play soccer in such a 
way that we will want to think of him in this way, the way he is now? HERO / 
VILLAIN 
</P>
<P>
 In order to be a savior there must be some thing in need of saving. 
</P>
<P>
 In this, the Argentinian national soccer team wrote its own perfect script for 
the return of a heroic Maradona. 
</P>
<P>
 The South American giant sputtered and coughed through World Cup qualifying 
and doomed itself to suffer great shame when it allowed the hated Colombians to 
beat them in Buenos Aires, 5-0. 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, in the opinion of the Argentine public, the qualification effort was 
in serious trouble. Argentina's coach, Alfio Basile, became the convenient 
monster. 
</P>
<P>
 Basile dared to leave Maradona off the roster for a key series of qualifying 
matches, a decision that should have been easily justified by Maradona's 
diminishing fitness and absent effort. Had it been any player other than 
Maradona the decision would have been debated, as all soccer matters are in 
Argentina, but it would not have stirred passions. 
</P>
<P>
 Basile learned, as he would again and again, that logical presumptions as to 
the role of the coach are turned on their head when it comes to Maradona. Far 
from having the right to select his own team, Basile found that he served as 
coach only at the whim of Maradona, who utterly controlled public opinion. 
</P>
<P>
 The rift was formed.  
</P>
<P>
 "I wouldn't play for Basile again if he came begging on his knees," Maradona 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no record of Basile's body position when he inquired of Maradona if 
he would be available to rejoin the team for the home-and-home series against 
Australia. Maradona was available. 
</P>
<P>
 Trapped, Basile had no room to move in order to save face as the entire nation 
knew he caved in to the demands of Maradona. 
</P>
<P>
 Strangely, Maradona's words regarding Basile never haunted him and the whole 
ugly affair only enhanced his reputation while confirming the perception of 
Basile as being not in control of his team . 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe we're just hotheads," Basile said as he and Maradona publicly made up, 
and no one seemed to snicker at the understated, but apt, description. 
</P>
<P>
 But Maradona redeemed himself, not that it was necessary to do much of 
anything but pull on the blue and white Argentina shirt for him to win the 
fans.  
</P>
<P>
 Maradona worked with a personal trainer, reportedly working out in a field 
frequented by deer and wild boar in a remote province. He reported to camp 25 
pounds lighter and with a sincere desire to help the team. He did, setting up 
Argentina's goal during the 1-1 tie in the first game at Sydney. 
</P>
<P>
 When the team won, 1-0, in the final match at Buenos Aires and qualified for 
the World Cup final the team was all hugs and kisses and arms outstretched to 
the heavens in the usual emotive fashion of the Argentines. 
</P>
<P>
 They had won and Maradona had played and it was as clear as anything that 
there was some inexplicable connection. He was a token and emblem of the team 
and the country and it simply was unthinkable to go to a World Cup final 
without him. HOMEWARD BOUND 
</P>
<P>
 Maradona began his career as a professional soccer player as a 15 year-old for 
Argentinos Juniors. For 12 years he played in such a way that made Argentinians 
proud to be from the country that produced Maradona. He embodied all that was 
the best in themselves: creativity, fearlessness, resourcefulness and an 
attitude of superiority. 
</P>
<P>
 When Maradona was sold to Barcelona from Boca Juniors for $10 million, 
Argentians felt they were worth millions, too. When Maradona was transferred to 
Napoli, Argentinians remembered their strong ties to Italy and thought of him 
as visiting relatives. 
</P>
<P>
 When Maradona captained Argentina's World Cup team to a victory over West 
Germany in the 1986 final, the country wept, for through him they had been held 
aloft as he held the World Cup's golden trophy. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time Maradona came back to play soccer in Argentina, it was because he 
was not wanted anywhere else. He did not return in triumph but in the night and 
with a baying pack of critics at his heels. When he came back he burrowed into 
the country where they would have trouble reaching him. 
</P>
<P>
 When Maradona returned to Argentina in the fall of 1993, it was not to one of 
the 20 huge metropolitan teams in Buenos Aires, but to the provincial town of 
Rosario and its smallish club, Newell's Old Boys. 
</P>
<P>
 Maradona's arrival coincided with the festive return of the Virgin of Rosario 
to her resting place in the cathedral of Rosario. As she was welcomed and 
venerated as an icon, so, too was Maradona. Signs in the town read, "Thank you, 
Diego. Welcome to our town. Now it's your home, too." 
</P>
<P>
 It's no reach to say that, to the citizens of Rosario, Maradona was perceived 
as a savior and redeemer. The town rests on the banks of the Parana River, 
wedged between the vast Pampas on one side and the swampy delta on the other. 
The single fact that Maradona would snub the richer clubs in Buenos Aires, his 
hometown, in favor of Rosario, gave the town a boost. Good enough for the great 
Maradona, good enough for me, people seemed to say, with a renewed civic pride. 
</P>
<P>
 Newell's is not even the largest club in the town. That would be Rosario 
Central, the blue and yellows, the team Che Guevara followed as he grew up 
here. That Maradona would select the smaller team is odd enough, but Newell's 
is also saddled with an unfortunate nickname, Los Leprosos , the Lepers. 
Perhaps, Maradona -- who has been unwelcome in many countries -- had found a 
metaphorical bond with the Lepers. 
</P>
<P>
 Maradona has given many reasons for choosing the team. He has told a story of 
leaving Seville and returning to his family in Argentina. He moved everyone, 
including his parents, to a small town in Corrientes province for the summer. 
There, in the cradling arms of nature, Maradona fished and healed his body and 
cleared his mind. 
</P>
<P>
 He said his hiatus convinced him to rediscover Argentina's soccer roots, which 
trace back to Newell's, one of the country's oldest clubs. Soccer fans love 
that story. 
</P>
<P>
 Another reason might be that Newell's wooed the boots off Maradona, paid 
Seville a $4 million transfer fee and Maradona a $25,000 a month salary. They 
promised him that the brightness of his stardom would wash over tiny Rosario 
with a power that would never be felt had he chosen Buenos Aires. He would be 
like a big whale in a small pond. 
</P>
<P>
 All true. 30,000 people showed up to watch Maradona's first practice. Maradona 
said he wanted to hug each one. "It's like starting to live again," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The club's finances flickered to life as well. Having averaged a gate of about 
10,000 pre-Maradona, the club began to draw three times that, translating into 
gate receipts of more than a half million dollars per game. The Argentine 
television network Telefe paid Newell's $800,000 for the rights to broadcast 
just the first game in which Maradona played, a meaningless exhibition against 
a team from Ecuador. 
</P>
<P>
 His performance will be added to the Maradona archives and offer proof that 
whatever else may be thought of him, Maradona was capable of creating moments 
of transcendence on a soccer field. 
</P>
<P>
 On his first touch in the first minute Maradona chested the ball and brought 
it down to his famous left foot. He flipped a 30-yard pass over his shoulder to 
a winger trailing on his right. Moments later he was crashing into the goal box 
letting loose a dangerous header. He scored a rare goal with his right foot. He 
showed a bicycle kick, a scissor-kick cross and the amasada -- the deft drag 
back move that he executed on England's Peter Reid in the 1986 World Cup, the 
move that launched the long run past four defenders and culminated in his 
beating goalkeeper Peter Shilton. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the account of the Newell's game in the Buenos Aires daily La 
Razon, Maradona played 90 minutes and had possession of the ball 102 times, 
made 62 successful passes, had five scoring attempts, took four corners and one 
free kick. In the 70th minute, the newspaper reported, the Virgin of Rosario 
turned her face toward Maradona and smiled. 
</P>
<P>
 Five months later Maradona left the team in a dispute -- the team complained 
he failed to show up for training sessions, he said he shouldn't have to. 
</P>
<P>

Aires. When reporters staked out the driveway in front of his home, asking why 
he left Rosario and Newell's, Maradona shot six reporters with a pellet rifle.

FRENCH OPEN; MEN: BRUGUERA DEFEATS COUNTRYMAN BERASATEGUI TO WIN SECOND 
CONSECUTIVE TITLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Alberto Berasategui had the crazy grip and feral forehand, but like so many 
others before him he did not have the stamina to withstand his friend Sergi 
Bruguera. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first all-Spanish Grand Slam tournament final, Bruguera, 23, turned a 
close match into a routine victory Sunday to win the men's French Open title, 
6-3, 7-5, 2-6, 6-1. 
</P>
<P>
 It happened with the flick of a wrist in the second set when No. 23 
Berasategui took a 4-1 lead but was broken twice and lost, 7-5. 
</P>
<P>
 Berasategui, who hits his forehand with a backhand grip, could not find the 
lines that he so effectively hit in reaching the final without losing a set. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got too tired," Berasategui said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bruguera tamed the game's most feared forehand by running it into the ground 
with his inclination to turn clay court tennis into a marathon. 
</P>
<P>
 "To control the forehand of Alberto is impossible," Bruguera said. "But you 
don't have to be afraid of it. The others might have lost even before they 
played him. I know how to play him. I know his weaknesses." 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, No. 6 Bruguera won his second consecutive French Open championship to 
become Spain's first two-time French champion since Manuel Santana in 1961 and 
'64. 
</P>
<P>
 In winning the first set after taking a 3-1 lead, Bruguera roamed the baseline 
trading groundstrokes with the hard-hitting Basque. The rallies were long. It 
was not unusual for them to exchange 26 strokes before an error. 
</P>
<P>
 That was fine with Bruguera, who can stay on the clay all day batting the 
ball. He lost only one set -- to Jim Courier in the semifinals -- as he 
advanced to Sunday's championship. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Bruguera becomes the world's best clay-court player with his 
convincing victory, he still has to prove himself as one of the sport's greats. 
</P>
<P>
 Except for losing in the first round of the U.S. Open last August, Bruguera 
had not played in a Grand Slam tournament since winning the French Open last 
year by defeating Courier in five sets. 
</P>
<P>
 Some have suggested he isn't a true star because of his lack of major 
tournament victories, but Bruguera has dismissed such criticism. 
</P>
<P>
 Agusti Pujol, president of the Spanish Tennis Federation, said the French Open 
is the most important Grand Slam tournament for his players because they grow 
up playing on clay. 
</P>
<P>
 "Concerned we are not," he said of the criticism. "We don't have to justify 
why Bruguera did not go to Wimbledon (last year)." 
</P>
<P>
 Bruguera will make an appearance on the lawn later this month, but he already 
is downplaying his chances. 
</P>
<P>
 Berasategui, however, will skip Wimbledon. But then, few thought he could 
advance so far in Paris. His coach, Javier Durate, tried to drum up publicity 
for the 20-year-old from Arrigorriaga by taking him around to newspaper and 
television reporters this spring. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now everybody talks about him," Durate said. "I knew his moment would 
arrive." 
</P>
<P>
 It did indeed, although he had to share it with Bruguera and all of Spain. 
Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Bryon Black and Jonathan Stark won the men's doubles title by defeating 
Sweden's Jan Apell and Jonas Bjorkman. . . . Kristie Boogert and Menno Oosting 
of the Netherlands won the mixed doubles title.

FRENCH OPEN; SPANISH CONQUEST; WOMEN: SANCHEZ VICARIO RATTLES PIERCE WITH LONG 
RALLIES, TRIUMPHS EASILY, 6-4, 6-4. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 About the only mistake Spain's Arantxa Sanchez Vicario made Sunday at Roland 
Garros Stadium was an innocent one. 
</P>
<P>
 After winning the French Open women's title by turning hard-hitting Mary 
Pierce into merely another error-prone player, Sanchez Vicario, speaking in 
English, thanked the Queen of Spain. 
</P>
<P>
 She meant King Juan Carlos I, as Queen Sofia was not among the 17,000 at 
Center Court who witnessed Sanchez Vicario's 6-4, 6-4 anticlimactic victory on 
a wind-swept day in Paris. The Queen did not arrive in Paris until the men's 
final. 
</P>
<P>
 The Spanish will forgive her indiscretion today because they will be too busy 
celebrating their ascent to the top of the tennis world. For the first time, a 
Spanish man and woman have won the same Grand Slam tournament. Sergi Bruguera 
won the men's title. 
</P>
<P>
 Spain's firm grip on the French Open was ensured Sunday when Sanchez Vicario 
defeated Pierce with defensive strokes that left her looking unsure for the 
first time in two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I was more mentally strong than she was," Sanchez Vicario said. "I 
just waited for my opportunities." 
</P>
<P>
 And once they started coming, they came like a cascade. Pierce reached the 
final by losing only a record-setting 12 games in six matches. Possessing the 
hardest-hitting forehand in women's tennis, she flattened opponents with almost 
too much ease. 
</P>
<P>
 But playing for France because her mother, Yannick, is French, she looked 
nervous Saturday when three games were completed before the match was suspended 
because of rain. Pierce led, 2-1, and was playing for a break point. 
</P>
<P>
 When play resumed Sunday afternoon, Pierce took less than a minute to take a 
3-1 lead with a backhand winner for the break. But it already was apparent she 
was not going to roll past Sanchez Vicario the way she did the others in Paris. 
</P>
<P>
 And, finally, serving for a 4-1 lead, Pierce failed to convert three game 
points -- each time on errors provoked by Sanchez Vicario. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike six opponents before, Sanchez Vicario was absolutely steadfast in 
forcing Pierce into long rallies. It was a strategy that earned Sanchez Vicario 
her second major title. She won the 1989 French Open when she was 17, and has 
finished second in three other Grand Slam tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
 The fifth game was a 15-minute struggle won by Sanchez Vicario when Pierce hit 
a backhand wide on the fourth break point. The next time she served, Pierce 
held off five break points to take a 4-3 lead, but her confidence was shaken. 
</P>
<P>
 Then Pierce, 19, did something her coach, Nick Bollettieri, told her not to: 
She started to think. Instead of serving confidently, Pierce slowly bounced the 
ball and deliberately tossed it in the air. Inevitably her first serve was 
long, and one of her vital weapons was rendered useless. 
</P>
<P>
 At one frustrating point, Pierce looked up in the stands and said to 
Bollettieri and her mother, "My feet are like lead." 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to win too much, I was taking the game too seriously," Pierce said. 
"Up until now I'd just been enjoying myself. Today I was a little tense." 
</P>
<P>
 Pierce, who entered the tournament ranked 12th but will improve to seventh 
when the rankings come out this week, has overcome many obstacles -- including 
problems with her father, Jim -- in the past year to reach her first Grand Slam 
tournament final. 
</P>
<P>
 She and her mother filed restraining orders to keep Jim Pierce from coming 
near them last winter. Pierce also was banned from tour events for disruptive 
behavior in the stands last year. 
</P>
<P>
 After Mary Pierce defeated top-ranked Steffi Graf in the semifinals, security 
guards were hired to protect the athlete although Jim Pierce was home in 
Florida. 
</P>
<P>
 Before Sunday, Graf or Monica Seles had won the 13 Grand Slam events after the 
Australian Open in 1991. This was only the second Grand Slam final since the 
1978 French Open in which neither Graf nor Seles, who has not competed since 
being stabbed in April of 1993, played. 
</P>
<P>
 Fans of women's tennis embraced Pierce as a fresh personality to join the 
elite players, but whether she will develop into a powerful force is debatable. 
</P>
<P>
 "It depends on what she wants to give of herself," Bollettieri said. "She has 
the potential, but also a lot of unknowns. We'll have to see what her reaction 
is to having a taste of a major championship (match)." Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Gigi Fernandez and Natalie Zvereva of Belarus defeated Americans Lindsay 
Davenport and Lisa Raymond in the women's doubles final, 6-2, 6-2.

<P>
 There will be no baseball Dream Team at the Atlanta Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
 The International Baseball Assn. Sunday narrowly rejected a proposal that 
would have allowed professional baseball players to represent their countries 
in official IBA events, including the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
 In a vote taken at a special meeting, 48 members voted to reword the 
eligibility requirements and 28 opposed the change. 
</P>
<P>
 A two-thirds majority, or 51 of the 76 countries represented, would have been 
needed to pass the motion.

STRODES CREEK UNINJURED IN TRAINING MISHAP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Strodes Creek, the Kentucky Derby runner-up trained by Charlie Whittingham, 
was taken off the track during training for the Belmont Stakes early Sunday 
morning in a horse ambulance but was uninjured. 
</P>
<P>
 Strodes Creek's exercise rider, Sonia Simmons, pulled up the 3-year-old colt 
during a morning gallop after she apparently thought the horse had taken a 
misstep. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nothing happened that we could see. He must have stepped on something or took 
a bad step. The girl jumped right off," Whittingham said. "The pony boy figured 
that it wouldn't be a bad idea to have him in the ambulance. He walked in fine 
and came out fine. He may have stepped on a rock. 
</P>
<P>
 "A couple of veterinarians looked at him and couldn't find anything wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 Groom Charles Clay said Strodes Creek's legs were iced and 16 X-rays were 
taken of his right-front leg, and "nothing appears wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 Whittingham said he planned to gallop Strodes Creek again today.

HOLLYWOOD PARK; THE WICKED NORTH SETS RECORD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB MIESZERSKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Any doubt about The Wicked North being the best handicap horse in the nation 
was dispelled by his performance in the $300,000 Californian at Hollywood Park 
on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 The 5-year-old son of Far North's neck victory over Kingdom Found in a track 
record 1:46 3/5 for 1 1/8 miles was probably his finest hour. The old track 
record of 1:46 4/5 was set by Sabona in the 1989 Californian and equaled by 
Latin American in last year's race. 
</P>
<P>
 Never particularly calm in the paddock or going to the gate, The Wicked North 
appeared more stirred up than usual Sunday. Then, as the field was preparing to 
enter the starting gate, Hill Pass' trainer, Jack Van Berg, revealed that his 
horse was carrying the wrong weight. 
</P>
<P>
 Due to the allowance conditions of the Californian, the 13-1 longshot was to 
carry 116 pounds, but the program said 114. Gary Stevens rides at 115, so the 
necessary adjustment had to be made. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Van Berg) called and said he thought his horse was carrying less than he 
should have," steward Pete Pedersen said. "We checked the conditions and he was 
absolutely right -- the least a horse could carry was 116. We were duty-bound 
to see the horse carry the right weight, so we called him in and made the 
correction." 
</P>
<P>
 After breaking from the rail, The Wicked North was content to stalk the pace 
set by Slew Of Damascus, but it looked like he might fade when he dropped back 
to third around the turn while Kingdom Found, an 8-1 shot, joined the leader. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Kent Desormeaux was simply waiting to get The Wicked North to the 
outside. Once he did, the 4-5 favorite took off for his eighth victory in 16 
starts. He has earned $1,124,500 for owners Phil and Sophie Hersh. 
</P>
<P>
 "Boy, he overcame some obstacles today," Desormeaux said. "That (10-minute) 
pre-race delay was a big one as far as my horse was concerned. He comes to the 
gate decent, but comes away crazy. So, every time he was turned away from the 
gate, he would freak out again. 
</P>
<P>
 "Man, he ran a couple of races today. I'm sure he'll sleep well tonight. He'll 
be shriveled up like a raisin. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was still wondering if we were going to win until about 10 strides before 
the wire. . . . He showed just how special he is." 
</P>
<P>
 Trainer David Bernstein agreed the Californian was The Wicked North's best 
race, but he wasn't happy about the delay. 
</P>
<P>
 "It irritated me," he said. "This kind of snafu shouldn't happen in a Grade I 
race like this, especially at a track like Hollywood Park. 
</P>
<P>
 "But he overcame everything and won. I'm proud of the horse. He set a track 
record and that's one of the kind of things he hadn't done and I think people 
were saying, 'This isn't a really good horse, that Holy Bull is fantastic,' but 
this horse only does what he has to to win. This is the most he's overcome in a 
race." 
</P>
<P>
 Kingdom Found, who lost a shoe when last in the John Henry Handicap on turf in 
his previous race, finished 1 3/4 lengths ahead of Slew Of Damascus. 
</P>
<P>
 "He ran great, he just got outrun the last sixteenth of a mile," jockey Chris 
McCarron said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The winner is the best handicap horse in the country right now, and he had to 
break the track record to beat Kingdom Found."

WELCH, SMYERS LEAD THE WAY IN PERFORMING ARTS TRIATHLON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATT FARMER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Greg Welch and Karen Smyers both overcame adversity Sunday en route to 
individual championships at the Mazda Orange County Performing Arts Center 
Triathlon at Lake Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
 Welch, the overall winner in 1 hour 52 minutes 33 seconds over the course that 
spanned a 1.5-kilometer swim, a 40-kilometer bike and a 10-kilometer run, has 
battled back from a head-on collision with a motorist last October. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the best my knee has felt since (the accident)," said Welch, a native 
of Sydney, Australia, who also trains in Colorado Springs, Colo., and 
Encinitas. 
</P>
<P>
 In training for the Hawaii Ironman, which is Welch's focal point, he has had 
to cut back his training regimen on the bike from the usual 300 to 400 miles 
per week to around a weekly clip of 200 because of a crash-related knee injury. 
That change seemed to pay off Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was a serious training tune-up," said Welch. "Maybe I'll back off more 
often." 
</P>
<P>
 For Smyers, there was no physical problem, but rather tough competition. 
</P>
<P>
 Smyers, a native of Woburn, Mass., managed her first triumph in almost two 
years over Australia's Michelle Jones, Triathlete magazine's triathlete of the 
year in 1993 and defending OCPAC winner. 
</P>
<P>
 The key to Smyers' victory was the bike segment, where she was a minute faster 
than any athlete in the 15-woman field. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought with that minute (lead after the bike) that this was my race to 
lose," Smyers said. "A minute is a pretty healthy gap." 
</P>
<P>
 Smyers heard the footsteps, but actually ended up widening the 56-second lead 
going into the final running segment by another nine seconds over Jones, 
posting a winning overall time of 2:04:01 to the Australian's 2:05:06. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was just one of the things where you are running as fast as you can," 
Smyers said. "If they would have told me I was running 5:20s (per mile) I 
wouldn't have slowed down, but if they had said 7s, I probably couldn't have 
picked it up either." 
</P>
<P>
 With the top three U.S. athletes in both the men's and women's races vying for 
a spot on the U.S. team for the 1994 Goodwill Games, the race to qualify was 
close. 
</P>
<P>
 Nick Radkewich (1:54:21), former University athlete Andrew Carlson (1:54:57) 
and former Corona del Mar and UC Irvine runner Darren Wood (1:55:00) took the 
next three places after Welch, assuring them of a spot in the international 
event, July 23-Aug. 7 in St. Petersburg, Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 Radkewich crossed the finish line after the swim and bike phases in fifth 
position, but managed to move up during the final running leg. Carlson was the 
first athlete out of the water on the opening leg. 
</P>
<P>
 Wood moved gradually to the front of the pack, only 20th after the swim, and 
managed to put himself in contention after posting the fourth-fastest bike leg 
of the 25-man field. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with Smyers, Martha Sorenson (2:07:58) and Juliana Nieverqelt (2:09:57) 
will represent the United States at the Goodwill Games.

JAZZ CAREER THAT'S A MUSICAL ODYSSEY; PROFILE: VINNY GOLIA STARTED AS AN 
ARTIST, SWITCHED TO PLAYING SAXOPHONE AND NOW ALSO COMPOSES AND HAS HIS OWN 
RECORD LABEL.

<P>
 The route to Vinny Golia's Elysian Park apartment is complicated and full of 
twists and turns, much like his jazz career. 
</P>
<P>
 The visitor ascends a steep, winding path of lefts and rights, finally 
arriving at a dirt lane cut into a hillside that leads to an eroded patch of 
ground where Golia's vintage Volvo station wagon sits at a precarious angle. 
From there, the way is on foot, up to a stucco building, then down a narrow and 
uneven set of concrete steps, bordered by bamboo screens and tangles of ivy. 
The air is filled with the nervous yelps of hidden dogs. 
</P>
<P>
 Suddenly the way ends at a large patio, shaded by a broad-shouldered pine that 
gives peek-a-boo views of the freeway and Los Angeles River below. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside are the tools of Golia's trade: a shiny contra-alto clarinet lounges on 
a folded futon while a bass clarinet stands crane-like near a music stand 
bristling with sheet music. The walls are decorated with various reed pipes and 
black-and-white pictures of past and present members of Golia's various jazz 
ensembles. Upstairs, his neighbor, trumpeter John Fumo, is practicing scales. 
</P>
<P>
 Past the kitchen is another room cluttered with music and instruments as well 
as the computer where he now does most of his composing. Against one wall is a 
stack of recent releases from Golia's 9 Winds record label. Despite the 
clutter, everything seems to fit just so. 
</P>
<P>
 The man himself, scheduled to perform at System M in Long Beach tonight, is 
telling a story from his art school days back in New York when he would sit in 
the clubs and sketch musicians as they played. This one's about how he met the 
late bassist-composer Charles Mingus. 
</P>
<P>
 "He started out the night bugged about something -- Mingus was strange to 
begin with -- but by the end of the night he was cool. As I was leaving, I felt 
this big hand on my shoulder. It was (saxophonist) Pharoah Sanders. 'I saw you 
drawing,' he said. 'Let's see what you've got.' 
</P>
<P>
 "After thumbing through my sketches, he asked if Mingus had seen them. He must 
have seen the fear in my eyes and started to laugh. 'Hey, Ming,' he said. 'Come 
over and look at these.' So Mingus waddles over . . ." and here Golia begins to 
imitate the sizable bassist's "Hmmphs!" and grunts as he examines the sketches. 
</P>
<P>
 "So I ended up giving him one. After that, he noticed me whenever I went in to 
see him and he'd say hello." 
</P>
<P>
 It was at another of these jazz and sketch-pad sessions in a Rhode Island club 
that Golia's life took a turn. The saxophonist he came to hear, his name now 
long forgotten, became too drunk to play and Golia volunteered to take over. It 
was the first time he ever handled a saxophone. "I'm sure it sounded terrible," 
Golia related in an earlier interview. "But they didn't seem to mind." 
</P>
<P>
 He progressed quickly, taking a few lessons from avant-garde composer and wind 
instrumentalist Anthony Braxton. By the time he relocated to Los Angeles, there 
were few wind instruments he didn't play.  
</P>
<P>
 Today, Golia divides his time between playing and composing, while managing 
his own record company, 9 Winds, which in its 17-year history has some 70 
releases. 
</P>
<P>
 "I originally started doing (the record company) so I could get my own albums 
out. But there were other musicians that I liked that weren't getting anything 
in the way of record contracts, so I started to promote them. Though most of 
the releases are now done on a cooperative basis, because I was losing too much 
money, I end up doing most of the work. But I don't mind because I like the 
music." 
</P>
<P>
 The range of 9 Winds' releases reflects Golia's interest in a wide array of 
styles. The label covers straight-ahead sessions, such as drummer Dick Berk's 
record, as well as more adventurous outings from vocalist Bonnie Barnett, 
bassist Steuart Liebig, guitarist G.E. Stinson and trombonist Joey Sellers. 
There are also duo, quintet and large ensemble recordings under Golia's name. 
</P>
<P>
 "It does include a little bit of everything," the 48-year-old Golia says. "But 
now I try to focus on America's West Coast, to present an overview of the music 
that's heard here." 
</P>
<P>
 Golia is a big part of that scene, both as a new music composer and an 
instrumentalist, though his contribution has been acknowledged by only a select 
audience, an injustice that seems to be changing. The Los Angeles County Museum 
of Art gave Golia a month's worth of Fridays in April to appear with various 
editions of his quintet. He has also appeared numerous times with his group and 
others at the New Music Monday series at Santa Monica's Alligator Lounge. 
</P>
<P>
 It's been a year since he's had a day job, mainly because he's been on the 
road so much -- all but about 14 days since January. Golia spent March touring 
the country with trombonist Michael Vlatkovitch. He's been to Europe twice this 
year and will return again next week to play an avant-garde festival in Kiev, 
capital of the Ukraine. 
</P>
<P>
 "It turns out they play a lot of my stuff on Radio Free Europe, so I'm known 
over there. The BBC (the United Kingdom's public radio station) did a show on 
me last January," he says, displaying a taped copy. "I ran into some guys in 
Austria not long ago who said, 'Man, we used to listen to your records in 
college.' That was very gratifying. It's nice to know you have an impact on the 
scene even when you think you don't." 
</P>
<P>
 When he's not touring, Golia wrestles with the split between playing and 
composing. "It's a fight, I'll tell you. I spend a lot of time writing, which 
is a holdover from my painting days when I was always working on producing 
something. But playing is so exhilarating. And it's hard to play several 
instruments without treating all but one as second fiddle." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to playing a bevy of instruments, Golia appears in several 
formats. "I play a lot of duos, which are heavy with improvisation. I play in 
two types of trios: bass and drums, and piano-bass. There's minimal writing for 
them. You end up playing a lot. It's like a pyramid, nobody can line up against 
you. The key is how the bass will react. It can lock you into a 4/4 jazz beat, 
or a good bassist will work in more of a classical idiom and you can really 
open up." 
</P>
<P>
 The quintet setting, which is how he'll appear Monday at System M, finds him 
using the second horn, usually trumpet, as a foil while he adds color switching 
between flute, clarinet and bassoon. With his largest ensemble, now up to a 
hefty 26 pieces, Golia plays less ("because there are so many great soloists in 
the orchestra") but covers more instruments.  
</P>
<P>
 "The original idea of the large ensemble was to bring the various L.A. musical 
factions together: the black jazz players, the classical players, the guys more 
out of the (jazz) tradition and the ones more on the fringes of the music, like 
me. We end up with something much greater than the sum of its parts." 
</P>
<P>
 Though the road is difficult for those like Golia whose sense of exploration 
and disdain for commercial categories keeps them struggling for financial 
success, he says he never sours on his chosen path. "Sometimes I'll play just 
one clarinet note and think, wow, that's great. Or I'll hear Alex 
(percussionist Alex Cline) hit a gong with the large ensemble behind him and it 
will just take me to another place. The only thing that gets me sour is not 
going to that place enough." 
</P>
<P>
 The Vinny Golia Ensemble plays tonight at 8 and 10 at System M, 213A Pine 
Ave., Long Beach. No cover. (310) 435-2525.

A TECHNOLOGY THAT PUTS ART IN THE DRIVER'S SEAT?; INTERACTIVE MEDIA: CONFERENCE 
PAYS HOMAGE TO THE ROLE OF ARTISTS IN FUELING INNOVATION.

 In a corner of the Los Angeles Convention Center, Ulrike Gabriel is fussing 
with her brainwave-sensitive robots. Down the way, Jeffrey Shaw swivels in the 
chair that lets him navigate through a 3-D "virtual museum" displayed on a huge 
computer screen. Nearby, Zane Vella video-conferences with his colleagues in 
Burbank as they stroll through "Cityspace," a digital model of a city created 
by children over the Internet computer network. 
</P>
<P>
 Each is part of the Interactive Media Festival, which opens to the public 
today in conjunction with the Digital World trade show. Traditionally a place 
for executives from the computing, entertainment and communications industries 
to meet, do business and find out about the latest interactive technologies, 
the conference this year will pay homage to the role of art and artists in 
driving technological innovation. 
</P>
<P>
 Musicians Peter Gabriel and Herbie Hancock, choreographer Debbie Allen, 
Telluride Film Festival director Tom Luddy and Oscar-winning costume designer 
Eiko Ishioka are among the panel that will pick the best three of the 
interactive media exhibits to receive a "Sparky" -- the slightly 
tongue-in-cheek crystal dog equivalent of the Oscar -- on Tuesday evening. 
Gabriel, whose interactive CD-ROM "Explora" is among the exhibits, will present 
the awards.  
</P>
<P>
 "In the past it has taken us a generation or more from the time we invent some 
new technology to the time we begin to understand the art forms that technology 
makes possible," says Digital World moderator Jonathan Seybold. "But with 
interactive, we don't have a generation. We believe strongly that from now on 
what is going to drive what happens is what you do with the technology, not 
technology itself." 
</P>
<P>
 The hype around "interactive multimedia" has so far concentrated largely on 
the commercial applications of the new medium. Interactive TV, we are told, 
will let consumers buy more stuff more easily. The fact that video games are a 
$6 billion-a-year business has become a refrain. It's an emphasis that misses 
crucial points, said festival organizers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Industry has seen interactive as war games and maybe some educational stuff," 
said Shaw, whose "Virtual Museum" has been displayed in European shows. 
"Artists are concerned with what this technology can do for human beings and 
their state of well-being." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, war games were not excluded from the gallery. Sega's "Virtual Fighter" 
arcade game will be displayed alongside "Soft Force," a globe-shaped brainwave 
analyzer in a garden setting. Other exhibits include "Telematic Dreaming," from 
Finnish artist Paul Sermon, "bayMOO," a text-based virtual world that 600 
people helped to create, and several CD-ROMs currently sold in stores, such as 
"Myst" and "Just Grandma and Me." 
</P>
<P>
 The brainchild of Cunningham Communications, the Boston-based public relations 
firm that initially funded the project, the festival has taken on a life of its 
own. Lisa Goldman, formerly of Cunningham, has spent the last two years 
organizing the show, which took off for real last year when Motorola donated $2 
million to the cause. 
</P>
<P>
 Last winter, a team of technically savvy nominators fanned out around the 
world to choose the pieces to be included. The criteria for nomination were 
fittingly broad for a set of ill-defined, rapidly evolving media: anything, so 
long as it was interactive. 
</P>
<P>
 In March, the field of 75 nominations was narrowed to the 26 that are 
displayed at the convention. But while the nominators were used to filter the 
best works by the technology community's standards, the judges were chosen in 
an attempt to avoid the techie trap of evaluating pieces based on the ingenuity 
of the technology rather than on their content as a whole. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted to invite people who are respected in their field but don't know 
enough about technology to be seduced by it," Goldman said. "We're trying to 
look at technology as art and as media, instead of as technology." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the festival, the Digital World conference will include the 
"Creative Cafe," co-sponsored by the Writers Guild of America, West, where 
writers in both the interactive field and the traditional entertainment 
industry will discuss writing for the new medium, and the "Creative 
Marketplace," where developers of interactive software will showcase their 
work. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps musician Thomas Dolby, who has helped promote the media festival, sums 
it up best: "If I were a 13-year-old and I wanted to create subversive art, I 
wouldn't go out and buy an electric guitar. I'd get myself a personal 
computer."

KCAL TAKES LION'S SHARE OF LOCAL EMMY AWARDS; TELEVISION: BUT KTTV GETS THE 
COVETED PRIZE FOR BEST HOURLONG NEWSCAST. KCET'S 'LIFE & TIMES' AND KABC'S 
'CITY VIEW' ARE THE MOST-HONORED SERIES, GOVERNORS AWARD IS GIVEN TO KTLA 
NEWSMAN LARRY MCCORMICK.

 KCAL-TV Channel 9 was the big winner in the 46th annual Los Angeles Area Emmy 
Awards, picking up 13 statuettes Saturday night -- five more than its closest 
competitor. But it failed to capture the coveted award for best hourlong 
newscast. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, in the equivalent of a movie winning the Oscar as best picture 
without collecting any honors for its writer, director or actors, KTTV-TV 
Channel 11's "Fox News at Ten" was named the best 60-minute newscast on local 
television during 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 The 10 p.m. KTTV newscast won only two other Emmys -- both for camera work -- 
while KCAL's "Prime 9 News at 10" garnered seven, including best news 
reporting, best sports reporting, best commentary and best editing. 
</P>
<P>
 But KCAL's "9 News at Noon" was named best daytime newscast, and the station's 
prime-time special, "Sex and AIDS in Russia," won two Emmys, for best program 
dealing with crime or a social issue, and for its host, Pat Harvey. 
</P>
<P>
 KNBC-TV Channel 4 got the Emmy for best 30-minute newscast for "Channel 4 News 
at 11." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the 13 Emmys for KCAL, KCBS-TV Channel 2 won eight, KABC-TV Channel 7 
got six and KTTV, KTLA-TV Channel 5 and KCET-TV Channel 28 earned five each. 
KNBC and KCOP-TV Channel 13 each won three, while KMEX-TV Channel 34 and 
KLCS-TV Channel 58 collected two each, and cable programmers KPAS 55 and 
Channel 35 got one apiece. 
</P>
<P>
 KCBS' Emmys included two to the team of reporter Harvey Levin and producer Ken 
Mate for best investigative reporting and best serious mini-documentary. The 
Channel 2 news department, which consistently trails KABC and KNBC in the 
ratings, also was honored for spot-news reporting, feature reporting and news 
writing. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside of news, KCET's "Life & Times" and KABC's "City View" were the 
most-honored series, picking up four Emmys each. But "Life & Times" beat "City 
View" for best informational/public affairs series shot outside a studio. "City 
View" won in that category last year. 
</P>
<P>
 The Governors Award, given to someone who has made a special contribution to 
Los Angeles-area television, went to Larry McCormick, a newsman at KTLA since 
1971 who previously worked at KABC and KCOP. McCormick anchors the weekend news 
at Channel 5 and also was co-host of "Making It! Minority Success Stories," 
which won the Emmy for best studio-based informational/public affairs series. 
</P>

2 SHOT TO DEATH, 7 WOUNDED AT SAN MARINO GRAD PARTY; CRIME: A VICTIM SAYS 
ASSAILANTS RETURNED AFTER AN ARGUMENT. FLYERS ADVERTISED THE EVENT, WHICH DREW 
100.

<P>
 Two young people wielding semiautomatic weapons sprayed gunfire through a high 
school graduation party at a home in affluent San Marino early Sunday, killing 
two students and wounding seven other people, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 A 14-year-old boy died in the back yard of a house valued at nearly $1 million 
on a cul-de-sac in northeast San Marino. He was identified as David Hang by the 
Los Angeles County coroner's office and by a distraught woman who stopped by 
the home Sunday afternoon and identified the dead boy to reporters as her son. 
</P>
<P>
 Another victim, who died at an undisclosed hospital, was identified as Dennis 
Buan, 18, of South Pasadena, said Lt. Deborah Peterson of the coroner's office. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said the wounded were between 17 and 21 years old. One, identified 
by friends as Oliver Chu, 18, was in serious condition Sunday, and six others 
were listed in stable condition. One teen-ager was treated and released. 
</P>
<P>
 Violence is rare in San Marino, a well-to-do city of 13,000 northeast of Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our neighborhoods are not neighborhoods now," said a woman passing by the 
bullet-riddled house Sunday. ". . . No one knows what's going to happen." 
</P>
<P>
 The assailants were a young man and a young woman who fired semiautomatic 
weapons into the crowd at 1 a.m., according to a San Marino High School student 
who was wounded in the fusillade. 
</P>
<P>
 About 100 had shown up at the party, an "End of the Year Jam" that charged $2 
at the door. Flyers advertising the event said it would run "from 7:30 to 
whenever the pigs come." 
</P>
<P>
 On the sidewalk in front of the house Sunday, a party-goer who identified 
himself as Tom said, "There's always parties like this in San Marino every 
weekend, huge rages. But they always get broken up" by police. 
</P>
<P>
 Some young guests said the host, high school student Frank Chen, had not given 
many parties but had taken the precaution of stationing someone at the door 
with a hand-held metal detector to screen party-goers. 
</P>
<P>
 A high school student who was wounded at the party and asked that his name not 
be used described the attack: 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought I was going to die, because it was just rat-a-tat-tat-tat-tat. They 
didn't say anything. I just heard my friends yell, 'Duck! Duck!' There were 
eight of us all in a row, and we all got shot." 
</P>
<P>
 The young man, still wearing the same bloodstained pants Sunday afternoon, 
said he had been shot in the buttocks. He described an argument at the party 
involving the disc jockey and several people, two of whom later came back 
shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 After the guests argued with the disc jockey, they reassured others that 
"everything was OK," the teen-ager said. "But they were just fooling us. They 
were setting us up for the slaughter." 
</P>
<P>
 Deputies said eight to 12 suspects, who had left the party after the dispute, 
returned in three cars. The two who did the shooting went into the back yard 
and "opened fire at the party-goers, spraying the exterior and the interior of 
the house," deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
 The parents of the party's young host were asleep in the house at the time, 
deputies added. 
</P>
<P>
 The wounded student said he and several friends were playing cards in the back 
yard "when all of a sudden they came back." He said the man carried what he 
thought was an AK-47 assault rifle, and the young woman had a pistol. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputies said both were believed to be carrying semiautomatic handguns. 
</P>
<P>
 As the pair were shooting, deputies said, other people were damaging cars 
parked in front of the home. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a gang thing," the wounded student told reporters when he returned to 
the house with his parents Sunday afternoon after being released from the 
hospital. "I don't want any pictures. I don't want any identification, because 
I'm afraid of retaliation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've just seen one of my friends shot in the intestines, and one was shot in 
the chest. And we're all very scared."

 One San Marino youth, who said he lent equipment to one of the party's two 
17-year-old disc jockeys, disputed the statement that an argument had prompted 
the shooting. The youth, who declined to give his name, said the disc jockey 
blamed the shooting on "some gang" that began making trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 Students who came by the house Sunday said that Hang, one of the dead, was a 
freshman at San Marino High and that Buan was a senior at South Pasadena High 
School. A small group of Hang's friends laid a bouquet of flowers at the place 
in the back yard where he had died. 
</P>
<P>
 No arrests had been made as of midday Sunday. The suspects are "predominantly 
Asian males and females," deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a messed-up party," said Vincent Liu, 17, of San Gabriel. "I knew 
something was going to happen." Liu said he drove to the party about 10 p.m. 
but was challenged in the street by a group of hostile youths who said they 
were from Burbank. Liu said he turned around and left to avoid trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators said the three vehicles involved were a white Mitsubishi Tredia, 
about a 1985 model; a red 1990 or 1991 Honda Civic hatchback, and a light gray, 
white or beige 1989 or 1990 Honda Civic four-door sedan. The Honda sedan 
collided with another car near the shooting scene and might be damaged, 
investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
 Property tax records show that the site of the party is a 13-room, 
3,600-square-foot home with a swimming pool, belonging to Fu Hsing and Jyu Yuan 
Chen, who bought the house in 1990 for $1.025 million. 
</P>
<P>
 San Marino Police Sgt. F. S. Beeal said his department is not prepared to 
investigate a crime of this nature, so the investigation was turned over to the 
Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Incidents such as this, he said, "are getting more frequent" in San Marino. 
</P>
<P>
 The city of expensive homes was in the news spotlight last month, when a 
swimming pool excavation unearthed human remains -- the first apparent homicide 
investigated in San Marino since the 1990 fatal shooting of a Taiwanese 
businessman in the driveway of his Bradbury Road home. 
</P>
<P>
 In December, a San Marino man suspected in a murder-for-hire plot against his 
wife was shot and killed in the police station by a detective he had just 
stabbed. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard August, 41, had pulled a knife from his waistband and stabbed the 
detective after he was arrested on suspicion of conspiracy in his wife's 
attempted murder, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 San Marino residents pride themselves on their good school system and 
manicured lawns. The community founded by old California families south of 
Pasadena has become home to a new Asian American gentry virtually overnight. 
</P>
<P>
 An American-born real estate agent of Asian descent described the community 
two years ago as being "like Beverly Hills to Asians." 
</P>
<P>
 The new Asian residents have brought a passion for education to the community 
that has helped make a first-rate school system even better, school officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The city is the birthplace and boyhood home of World War II tank commander 
Gen. George S. Patton and home to the Huntington Library, which houses a 
renowned collection including Thomas Gainsborough's "Blue Boy," Thomas 
Lawrence's "Pinkie," a Gutenberg Bible, a manuscript of Chaucer's "Canterbury 
Tales" and many other works of art and literature.

ORIGINAL 1944 CAST STILL JUMPING; VETERANS: FORTY FORMER PARATROOPERS, AGES 68 
TO 83, RE-ENACT THEIR HISTORIC MISSION OVER FRANCE.

 Thomas Rice, a retired San Diego high school teacher, gave the thumbs-up sign 
to his comrades Sunday and then stepped out of a plane 3,500 feet above France. 
As a brisk wind opened his parachute and snapped at the crease in his new 
pants, Rice looked down on the green fields of Normandy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just kept thinking I didn't want to land in that field with the three bulls 
in it," the 73-year-old Rice said moments later, safely on the ground, his 
angular face smeared with mud. "But, thank goodness, I just got a little wet." 
</P>
<P>
 Rice and 39 other World War II veterans, ranging in age from 68 to 83, 
parachuted near this village Sunday, re-enacting their daring invasion of 
German-held France 50 years ago. With a crowd of dignitaries and a fully 
equipped MASH unit waiting below, the men filled the sunny afternoon sky like 
multicolored confetti. 
</P>
<P>
 "We did it because, well, a lot of our friends were killed here 50 years ago," 
said Rice, who had been a platoon leader in the 101st Airborne on D-day and 
suffered shrapnel wounds to a leg and arm. "And sometimes over the years we 
have felt some guilt about that. But today I feel like I can bury that guilt 
and not worry about it anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 Added Robert Dunning, 73, from Atlanta: "It was a great feeling. Back in 1944, 
it was 2 a.m., we were under sniper fire and I missed the target by 20 miles. 
It was easier this time. Nobody was shooting at us." 
</P>
<P>
 But winds did push several of the veteran paratroopers off course. 
</P>
<P>
 Rene Dussaq of Encino, at 83 the oldest of the veteran jumpers, landed miles 
away from the drop zone, and U.S. spotters in helicopters lost sight of him. He 
was eventually found by French firefighters, and two hours later Dussaq was 
having a drink in Sainte-Mere-Eglise. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a little wind, but it was not too bad," Dussaq said. "It was very 
pleasant. You could look around at the countryside. It was very beautiful." 
</P>
<P>
 In the town square of Sainte-Mere-Eglise, a crowd of more than 8,000 turned up 
to greet the jumpers and other returning U.S. veterans. The grinning jumpers, 
wearing replicas of the uniforms they wore in 1944, signed autographs, shouted 
" bonjour " to well-wishers and accepted kisses from women in the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite widespread fears for their safety, not the least from their own 
families, only two of the aging paratroopers were injured in the jump. One 
twisted his ankle, and a second, Earl Draper, 70, of Inverness, Fla., was 
hospitalized with minor back injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 Draper's main chute opened, but the lines became snarled. As the crowd watched 
in fearful silence, he deployed an emergency reserve chute, which is harder to 
control, and landed a few dozen feet from the MASH unit. He was taken by 
helicopter to a local hospital, where an Army spokesman said he was "doing 
fine." 
</P>
<P>
 "Mr. Draper did just the right thing," said U.S. Army Col. Richard M. Bridges, 
himself a paratrooper. "My hat's off to him. He did a terribly courageous 
thing. But I'm proud of them all. I just hope I can do that when I'm their 
age." 
</P>
<P>
 The veterans' jump was followed by a spectacular jump by 700 U.S. and French 
paratroopers, who alighted without incident on the pastures amid yellow 
buttercups. 
</P>
<P>
 The show was part of a daylong celebration at Sainte-Mere-Eglise, which was 
the first French town liberated on D-day, freed by U.S. paratroopers even 
before Allied troops landed at the nearby Utah and Omaha beaches. The town has 
hosted U.S. veterans and their families every year since the war, and for years 
the mayor's wife wrote to families of U.S. servicemen and tended the graves of 
those who died here. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday, the community was bedecked with U.S. and other Allied nations' 
flags. One sign in the crowd read, "We Never Forget You Guys." 
</P>
<P>
 Among those on hand to welcome the veterans was Prime Minister Edouard 
Balladur and Rep. Sam Gibbons (D-Fla.), the House Ways and Means Committee 
chairman and D-day veteran who is President Clinton's representative to the 
festivities. 
</P>
<P>
 "We came to see them because of the memories," said Jean-Charles LePouder, 38, 
who brought his wife and two children from a nearby town. "This is really an 
important part of our history." 
</P>
<P>
 A full day of activities, attended by Clinton and other national leaders, is 
scheduled for today in Normandy. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton will first address veterans at Pointe de Hoc, the cliff taken by U.S. 
Army Rangers in 1944. Later, he will talk to several thousand veterans at the 
American Cemetery on the cliff above Omaha Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. paratrooper assault around this village in the early hours of June 6, 
1944, was part of an important first attack designed to make it impossible for 
the Germans to reinforce their troops stationed on cliffs above the beaches. On 
that day, U.S. planes carrying the paratroopers came under heavy ground fire 
and were going twice the normal jump speed when the soldiers emerged to fill 
the night sky. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the American jumpers were blown off target that day, but the scattered 
landings helped confuse the Germans. 
</P>
<P>
 Some American soldiers drowned in fields that had been flooded by the Germans, 
and others were killed by snipers. Of those who jumped in 1944, one in five 
died in the descent or in the fighting that followed. 
</P>
<P>
 One paratrooper's chute caught on the 12th-Century church steeple in the 
center of town, and he pretended to be dead until help arrived. His exploits 
are honored by a mock paratrooper, complete with chute, that still hangs from 
the church steeple. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision by the aging veterans to jump was greeted with some concern by 
the French government and the U.S. Army, as well as local residents. 
</P>
<P>
 "They don't need to jump to be heroes to us," said Henri-Jean Renaud, the son 
of the former mayor and now a pharmacist in town. 
</P>
<P>
 But the officials relented when each of the former paratroopers completed 
three practice jumps in San Diego. For the jump Sunday, they used modern 
parachutes, which are easier than military chutes to guide. And they also 
jumped from a much greater height -- 3,500 feet compared to the 500 feet that 
is standard during combat assaults. The higher altitude provides a greater 
safety margin, creating more time to deal with parachute problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "Crazy? Do I look crazy?" asked Warran Wilt, 71, from Abbeyville, Kan. "No. We 
just had to do this. The people we left here deserved this." 
</P>
<P>
 Barbara Williams, whose 71-year-old husband, Bob, was among the jumpers, said 
she was "scared to death when I saw that one man have trouble with his chute." 
But she was pleased when it was over. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a relief just to get out of that plane, I'll tell you," paratrooper 
Dunning said. "It was freezing up there. But when we jumped, it was heaven. I 
was smiling. But then I thought, I just don't want to fall in the mud."

ALLIES SAIL FOR D-DAY PLUS 50; WORLD WAR II: CLINTON, QUEEN ELIZABETH, OTHER 
LEADERS JOIN MASSIVE FLOTILLA FROM ENGLAND TO FRANCE. PRESIDENT PAYS HOMAGE TO 
THOSE WHO GAVE 'RISE TO A NEW ERA OF HOPE AND PROGRESS.'

<P>
 President Clinton, Queen Elizabeth II and a shipload of Allied leaders sailed 
in a massive flotilla late Sunday from this historic English Channel port for 
France to observe the 50th anniversary of D-day. 
</P>
<P>
 En route, the fleet dropped wreaths in the Channel. Two million red poppies, 
symbolizing remembrance, fluttered down from a low-flying Lancaster bomber. The 
armada planned to anchor offshore before going on to the five D-day beaches -- 
two American, two British and one Canadian -- where the great northern European 
assault against Nazi forces to end World War II was launched. 
</P>
<P>
 In a commemorative message that had overtones of Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower's 
message to the troops on D-day, Clinton declared: "The heroic men who fought 
and died during those difficult days helped to give rise to a new era of hope 
and progress, starting a trend toward democracy and human dignity that 
continues to this day. 
</P>
<P>
 "The peoples of nations around the world persist in throwing off the shackles 
of tyranny and in seeking the blessings of liberty. On this historic occasion, 
we, the benefactors of the freedom won by our courageous armed forces, 
rededicate ourselves to embracing these epic changes. 
</P>
<P>
 "In memory of all those who lost their lives on Normandy's shore, we reaffirm 
our commitment to building a safer, more peaceful world for the generations to 
come." 
</P>
<P>
 The fleet of ships steamed Sunday afternoon from this main invasion supply 
port after daylong ceremonies. The seaside was lined with tens of thousands of 
Britons and Americans, young and old, who turned out to see off the armada 
heading for Normandy. 
</P>
<P>
 They waved farewell to the ships, watching as they moved past concrete forts 
in the harbor, just as previous generations had done at this ancient navy town. 
</P>
<P>
 Many with binoculars could spot the national flags of the warships and call 
out the identifications to their children. 
</P>
<P>
 A vendor moved among the crowd chanting, "Cockles, mussels, prawns." 
</P>
<P>
 Many families picnicked on the green lawns of the seafront in a festive Sunday 
outing, listening to radios describing the events. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton boarded the nuclear-powered carrier George Washington -- at 97,000 
tons, the world's largest -- whose crew he addressed after he was piped aboard 
in the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier, Queen Elizabeth, with many visiting heads of state and government, 
boarded the royal yacht Britannia to review warships of the Allied nations that 
participated in the D-day landings June 6, 1944. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those present were British Prime Minister John Major, Canadian Prime 
Minister Jean Chretien, Polish President Lech Walesa, Czech President Vaclav 
Havel, Slovakian President Michal Kovac, Australian Prime Minister Paul 
Keating, New Zealand Prime Minister Jim Bolger, King Harald of Norway, King 
Albert II of Belgium and Prince Bernhard of the Netherlands. 
</P>
<P>
 They were joined by members of the British Royal Family, including Princess 
Diana. The yacht arrived in France later to the cheers of thousands of 
well-wishers. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast to the drenching, cold weather that dampened the spirits of 
Saturday's ceremonies, the weather in Portsmouth on Sunday was crisp and clear, 
though changeable. 
</P>
<P>
 The morning began here with a Drumhead Ceremony, which was once the 
traditional religious observance to bless the colors and uplift the hearts of 
the soldiers and sailors -- "at the point at which troops cannot be pulled back 
from the battle." 
</P>
<P>
 The Archbishop of Canterbury, assisted by a dozen other clergymen, blessed the 
fleet that was preparing to leave for Normandy and large-scale, daylong 
observances and events today. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior U.S. military officers, including members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, 
attended the ceremony -- which was also watched by thousands of visitors. 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, the dignitaries boarded the Britannia, a royal-blue vessel with tan 
funnels and masts. The ship's crew of 276 includes the band of the Royal 
Marines, which played to welcome Clinton and his fellow leaders and their 
spouses. 
</P>
<P>
 As an estimated 4,000 small craft, from yachts to dinghies to motor launches, 
bobbed around the bigger warships, 40 ships participated in the naval review -- 
including the Canberra, a luxury liner that ferried British fighting battalions 
to the Falkland Islands, and the Fearless, which carried Royal Marine commandos 
in that action. 
</P>
<P>
 The fleet review was preceded with a flyover by World War II aircraft: an old 
biplane Swordfish torpedo bomber, British Spitfire and Hawker Hurricane 
fighters, a U.S. B-17 Flying Fortress bomber, a P-51 Mustang fighter and a C-47 
Dakota transport -- followed by low-flying modern jet fighters from Allied 
nations, some forming the number "50." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton boarded the Jeremiah O'Brien, a World War II Liberty ship that made 11 
Channel crossings during the invasion. Taken out of mothballs, it had sailed 
from San Francisco last month with a volunteer crew of veteran merchant seamen 
on board. 
</P>
<P>
 About 20 minutes before Clinton boarded the George Washington, Capt. Robert 
Sprigg told the crew over the loudspeaker that listening to the President was 
"a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and I hope to see you there. I encourage 
everybody, I mean everybody, to go and hear his own ideas and what he'd like to 
say to you." 
</P>
<P>
 On board, the President, apparently seeking to show his support for the armed 
forces, told the crew: "You are, beyond question, the best-trained, the 
best-equipped fighting force the world has ever known. And I want you to know 
that I am committed unequivocally, absolutely, to ensuring that you continue to 
have what you need to do your job. You deserve it. Our security demands it." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton added: "The strength of our military is not really in our ships, our 
tanks or our aircraft, it is in you -- the dedicated professionalism of the men 
and women of the United States armed forces." 
</P>
<P>
 That remark was greeted by applause, as was the President's statement to the 
sailors that the downsizing of the military was now halfway finished and would 
be completed in two years. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we learned any lesson from the magnificent, heroic, almost unbelievable 
endeavor of D-day," Clinton said, "it was that if the Allies would stay 
together and stay strong, we would never need another D-day. That is what you 
are guaranteeing. And your country is deeply in your debt." 
</P>
<P>
 As for his own feelings about D-day during his trip so far, the President 
added: "You know what encapsulates this all for me? Eisenhower's words, in 
which he said that D-day was 'the fury of an aroused democracy.' Those words 
say it all."

CLINTON WARNS OF U.S. CURBS ON N. KOREA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN M. BRODER and DAVID LAUTER, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton, under fire from critics who have accused him of being too 
soft in opposing North Korea's purported nuclear ambitions, significantly 
stepped up his rhetoric Sunday, saying the United States would consider 
imposing sanctions without the United Nations if the Security Council proved 
unable to make a decision. 
</P>
<P>
 He also warned that North Korea would risk "certain, terrible defeat and 
destruction" if it retaliated. 
</P>
<P>
 The remarks, made in nationally televised interviews as Clinton sailed toward 
France for the commemoration of the D-day landing, came only a day after the 
President had said he did not want "a lot of saber-rattling talk over this." 
</P>
<P>
 Together, the President's comments illustrated the narrow line he and his top 
aides are trying to walk as they try to manage the crisis that has developed 
from North Korea's refusal to allow International Atomic Energy Agency 
inspections of its nuclear facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 On the one hand, the Administration wants to counter the attacks of U.S. 
critics who have accused Clinton of being weak and vacillating in his foreign 
policy. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday, for example, Sen. John McCain of Arizona, a leading Republican 
foreign policy spokesman, charged the Administration with "appeasement" of the 
North Koreans and said Clinton was acting in the "tradition of Neville 
Chamberlain," the British prime minister who surrendered Czechoslovakia to 
Hitler in the years before World War II. McCain made his comments on the CBS-TV 
program "Face the Nation." 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, Clinton and his aides want to play down the talk of war that 
has buzzed through Washington in recent days, fearing, among other things, that 
bellicose language from U.S. officials could get out of hand, potentially 
prompting the unpredictable North Korean leaders into a preemptive strike that 
could open a full-scale war. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States, Japan and South Korea have agreed to seek sanctions against 
North Korea in the wake of the declaration by the IAEA that North Korean 
actions had made it impossible to verify whether or not Pyongyang had diverted 
weapons-grade plutonium from an experimental nuclear reactor. Such acts by 
North Korea would violate the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, North Korean spokesmen have said any sanctions would be 
considered an act of war, but U.S. officials have dismissed those statements as 
bluster. Clinton, interviewed by ABC News, said he did not believe that the 
North Koreans would carry through on those threats. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think that they would risk the certain, terrible defeat and 
destruction that would occur if they did that," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But while the Administration proceeds to seek sanctions from the United 
Nations, senior U.S. officials, worried that China will veto any sanctions 
resolution, have begun to explore additional avenues to thwart the Pyongyang 
regime. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense Secretary William J. Perry said Sunday on NBC-TV's "Meet the Press" 
program that it is "entirely possible" that Beijing would block a U.N. Security 
Council resolution against North Korea. 
</P>
<P>
 And Clinton, interviewed by NBC News, said that while he still hopes support 
from China and Russia will allow the United Nations to move forward, "if it 
doesn't we'll have to look at who else wants to do it, and what else we can 
do." Sanctions could be imposed by a "so-called coalition of the willing," 
Clinton added. 
</P>
<P>
 Perry and other senior officials here for ceremonies commemorating the 50th 
anniversary of D-day insisted that the Administration will continue to work 
through the United Nations and privately with Beijing to try to reach a 
consensus on a U.N. sanctions resolution. 
</P>
<P>
 But officials noted Beijing's continued reticence about punishing -- and 
possibly provoking -- its Communist neighbor and important trading partner. 
</P>
<P>
 Other officials caution that the Administration sees sanctions as a difficult 
and potentially dangerous step and would prefer to compel Pyongyang to accept 
international oversight of its nuclear facilities through less drastic means. 
</P>
<P>
 But North Korea said Sunday that it will not bow to outside pressure to open 
up its nuclear program, which it insists is peaceful. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do not want confrontation," said the North Korean Workers Party daily 
Rodong Sinmun, according to the official Korean Central News Agency monitored 
in Tokyo. "But we do not have the intention to meet an unjustifiable demand 
under continued pressure and cannot tolerate our sovereignty encroached upon." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton and Perry tried to downplay talk of possible military confrontation 
with North Korea over the nuclear issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do not think we are facing imminent danger," Perry said. "I think this 
whole talk of war is quite premature, and it's creating a sort of hysteria 
which is not appropriate to the present situation." 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, both men also sought to rebut criticism that the 
Administration had not done enough to prepare for the defense of South Korea 
and the more than 30,000 U.S. troops stationed there. 
</P>
<P>
 "Certainly we're not seeking, we will not provoke, a war," Perry said. "But at 
the same time, we will not invite a war by not being ready. . . . We have been 
building up our forces over the last six months. We will continue to develop 
them as necessary as the situation on the ground warrants." 
</P>
<P>
 Perry said the United States and South Korea believe that their military 
forces are adequate to deter an attack from the North. But he said that if 
North Korea moves its forces closer to the border or makes other threatening 
moves, "we will take whatever actions are necessary." 
</P>
<P>
 As Administration officials tried to calibrate their public message, they came 
in for continued heavy criticism at home. In addition to McCain, Former 
Secretary of State James A. Baker III criticized the Administration's handling 
of the Korean crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we probably should have done a while ago is to make it clear to the 
North Koreans that we're serious about this, that when we say something, we 
mean it," said Baker, who is a potential Republican candidate for President in 
1996. He made his comments on "Meet the Press." 
</P>
<P>
 Baker said the Administration's efforts to negotiate with Pyongyang are 
counterproductive and make the United States and the United Nations look weak. 
</P>
<P>
 Baker did, however, endorse Perry's suggestion that the United States would 
pursue sanctions unilaterally. He said that nearly all Asian nations are 
unanimous in not wanting nuclear weaponry on the Korean peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we could bring to bear a significant international coalition and 
international support behind those sanctions," Baker said.

METHODS TO FIX HIGH-RISE STEEL FAIL STRESS TESTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Costly retrofitting methods already being used to fix steel-frame buildings 
cracked in the Northridge earthquake have failed strength tests, leaving 
officials baffled about how to mend broken welds and beams in dozens of Los 
Angeles high-rises. 
</P>
<P>
 Tests conducted at the University of Texas at Austin found that the repair 
methods recommended by Los Angeles city building officials failed when 
subjected to simulated 7.0 magnitude earthquakes, researchers said over the 
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 The connections broke easily and were only one-sixth to one-third as strong 
and flexible as they should be, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are some very fundamental things here that we don't appear to 
understand," said University of Texas professor Michael D. Engelhardt, a 
leading steel expert who conducted the study for the American Institute of 
Steel Construction. "We can now report what doesn't work. 
</P>
<P>
 "But we still don't know what does work," he said. "Even with improvements, 
there were cracks early on in the tests. It's very discouraging." 
</P>
<P>
 The test results were so poor, he said, that five remaining simulations have 
been halted. 
</P>
<P>
 The initial results will be presented to Los Angeles building officials today, 
so they can discuss other possible retrofitting methods. 
</P>
<P>
 Steel-frame mid- and high-rise office buildings, designed to bend with 
enormous earthquake forces without breaking, were considered among the safest 
to ride out an earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 None of these modern buildings came close to collapse in the Jan. 17 quake, 
engineers said. But in a development that rattled experts, widespread cracking 
has been discovered in the welded connections of the beams and columns of at 
least 90 buildings, most in the San Fernando Valley and on the Westside. Up to 
90% of the connections in some buildings cracked. 
</P>
<P>
 Results from the Texas tests -- the main effort to find a solution to the 
problem -- are of particular concern because the welding methods and design 
changes tested are currently being used in the city's high-rises. Officials are 
requiring their use in the retrofitting of quake-damaged buildings and in new 
construction. 
</P>
<P>
 "Construction is going on with processes that may not work," said Los Angeles 
structural engineer Thomas Sabol, who serves on the city panel studying the 
problem with steel-frame buildings. "They are wasting their money." 
</P>
<P>
 Such retrofits cost $800 to $2,000 per joint, so repairs could run into the 
millions of dollars in large buildings with hundreds of cracked joints. 
</P>
<P>
 The owners of 30 steel-frame commercial buildings already have taken out 
permits to conduct repairs, and about half of the repairs have been completed, 
said Richard Holguin, assistant chief of the city's building bureau. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's recommendations to steel-frame building owners after the Northridge 
quake were based on engineering simulations conducted before the temblor. These 
showed that joints reinforced in certain ways -- usually with steel plates -- 
performed better than those built to the current code. 
</P>
<P>
 "It appears that the fixes we have been proposing do not seem to work," 
Holguin said. "We're not sure what the next step is. At this point, we don't 
have a clue." 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Borax Inc. is completing repairs on its four-story headquarters in 
Valencia, where 80% of the 700 building connections cracked or were damaged. 
The tab: $5 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Reconstruction supervisor Andrew Lisowski said the company used several 
retrofitting techniques in consultation with experts and conducted its own 
stress tests to find a solution. "I don't think we will have to redo this," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Like many other businesses with cracked steel-frame buildings, U.S. Borax has 
had to operate in temporary quarters. The company has temporarily dispatched 
staff to work in offices from Wilmington to London. 
</P>
<P>
 Previous city building codes were based largely on specifications recommended 
by the Structural Engineering Assn. of California. Derived from the best 
available earthquake simulation test data and engineering calculations, these 
specifications were thought to be rigorous enough so that steel-frame buildings 
might sustain structural damage in the largest expected earthquake, but never 
collapse. 
</P>
<P>
 Some engineers now believe, however, that those tests may have been based on 
an underestimation of how flexible the building joints really are. 
</P>
<P>
 The Texas tests sought to measure how far steel could be stressed without 
snapping. Life-sized columns and horizontal beams were welded together in 
California. Then the mock-ups were shipped to the University of Texas, where a 
hydraulic arm was used to shake the beam up and down, simulating an earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 The steel frames were strengthened in various ways. Welds were reinforced. 
Previously bolted parts were welded. And the connections were buttressed by 
additional steel plates welded to the top and bottom of beams. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, some connections broke after the beam had been shaken up and down 
just once. 
</P>
<P>
 "It just snapped. This was nothing less than shocking," said Engelhardt, 
adding that such connections had held up in previous, less sophisticated tests. 
</P>
<P>
 Researchers, Engelhardt added, have not even begun examining why in some 
buildings the steel columns themselves cracked. "Finding answers to all this 
could take some time," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Engineers and city officials are still unclear as to what magnitude earthquake 
it takes for the connections to crack. But some say further study is needed to 
determine whether a limited number of these buildings could collapse in an 
earthquake stronger and longer-lasting than the Northridge temblor. 
</P>
<P>
 But engineers can point to only one steel-frame building that has collapsed in 
an earthquake -- in Mexico City -- and they emphasized that even now 
steel-frame buildings are considered safer in an earthquake than non-ductile, 
or brittle, concrete buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 Manufacturers of steel-frame homes say they have not had problems with 
connections cracking. Cracks in the steel frames of government and commercial 
buildings occurred as far from the epicenter of the Northridge quake as East 
Los Angeles. City officials estimate that nearly a quarter of the 400 
steel-frame buildings in the Valley and Westside were affected. The tallest is 
an unidentified 23-story tower in the Valley, which is unoccupied. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials have been urging the owners of steel-frame buildings to conduct 
inspections for cracks. They also are pushing a proposal, now before the City 
Council, that would require inspections of the steel-frame buildings in the 
Valley and on the Westside. 
</P>
<P>
 The California Seismic Safety Commission in April issued a public advisory 
about steel-frame office buildings, urging that owners who observed even 
cosmetic damage to their buildings have them inspected by engineers and other 
experts. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really don't have any instinct on how to solve this. This is a puzzle to 
us," said Paul Fratessa, an Oakland structural engineer and member of the 
seismic commission. 
</P>
<P>
 "I still have a lot of confidence in steel," he said. "I'm not panicked, but I 
am concerned that we move rapidly to get an answer."

TIMES MIRROR DEAL WITH COX SIGNALS NEW STRATEGY; MEDIA: FOLLOWING THE 
$2.3-BILLION SALE OF ITS CABLE OPERATIONS, FIRM WILL FOCUS ON INFORMATION 
SERVICES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Times Mirror Co. confirmed Sunday that it has agreed to spin off its cable 
operations into a new venture with Atlanta-based Cox Enterprises Inc. for $2.3 
billion, as part of a long-term strategy to become a major player in providing 
information services for the digital age. 
</P>
<P>
 Cox will manage the combined cable operations through its Cox Cable 
Communications Inc. subsidiary, which will become a publicly traded company. 
The deal creates the nation's third-largest cable TV operator, with 3.1 million 
subscribers. 
</P>
<P>
 Times Mirror's shareholders -- excluding the founding Chandler family's trusts 
-- will retain 20% of the new company, receiving about $932 million worth of 
Cox Cable's common stock, and Cox will also assume $1.364 billion in new Times 
Mirror debt. 
</P>
<P>
 Times Mirror plans to use at least part of the proceeds to develop new 
programming ventures. As part of the strategy, it will form a partnership with 
Cox to develop new cable TV channels to be carried over the combined systems. 
</P>
<P>
 At a time of on-again, off-again media mergers -- when companies are 
struggling to deal with technological changes that could dramatically alter the 
way consumers receive information -- Times Mirror in effect has decided to 
divide itself in two. The move separates the production of information -- which 
has traditionally been the company's core business -- from its delivery. 
</P>
<P>
 "You come to a fork in the road where you have to decide what to do with your 
business, and we took the content side," said Robert F. Erburu, Times Mirror 
chairman, president and chief executive. "Our feeling is that in order to be 
successful in cable you have to get a lot bigger, and to do that would have 
interfered with our intention to focus on content." 
</P>
<P>
 With the cable business consolidated under Cox, Times Mirror will turn its 
attention to new ways of leveraging its existing assets: the Los Angeles Times, 
Newsday and New York Newsday, The Baltimore Sun, The Hartford Courant and some 
smaller papers; consumer magazines such as Popular Science and Outdoor Life; a 
profitable professional and textbook publishing business, and a recently 
launched television programming division. 
</P>
<P>
 Concerns about the future of newspapers in their current form is another 
reason Times Mirror is focusing on developing new modes of production and a 
wider breadth of media. Some analysts believe that most information will be 
delivered electronically in the future, rather than on paper. 
</P>
<P>
 "A substantial part of our business will still be the traditional newspaper 
business in five years," Erburu said. "I don't think things are going to change 
that fast. But the challenge for us will be to build the new businesses as fast 
as we can, because that is the only hedge we have against something happening 
to the traditional business faster than we think." 
</P>
<P>
 After aggressively moving into cable TV in the 1970s, Times Mirror has not 
substantially expanded its holdings recently. In a statement Sunday, Cox said 
the Times Mirror systems in Orange County, Phoenix and other places will 
continue to operate as usual for the coming months. Cox added that the new 
company may not go into effect until the start of 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Cox is currently the nation's sixth-largest cable operator, with subscribers 
in San Diego, New Orleans and Virginia, among other places. The combined 
operations will form a regional cluster of systems in the Southwest which will 
enable it to better compete with local telephone companies in offering new 
information services. 
</P>
<P>
 For privately held Cox, the deal signifies a commitment to become a major 
force in delivering information services and entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
 The Atlanta-based company, whose holdings include the Atlanta 
Journal-Constitution and several TV and radio stations, has been in an 
aggressive mode recently. Last year, it offered $500 million toward QVC's 
failed bid for Paramount Communications. The company also tried to merge its 
cable system with Southwestern Bell in a deal that ultimately failed over 
regulatory problems and other complications. 
</P>
<P>
 At a time when cable, phone, computer and consumer electronics firms are all 
squabbling over what the various forms of delivery systems will look like, 
analysts have noted that the companies producing the most versatile programming 
are in a particularly strong position. 
</P>
<P>
 To that end, Times Mirror and Cox said they plan to "explore a collaborative 
test" to provide an array of interactive information and entertainment services 
to homes and businesses over a fiber network in Irvine later this year, as many 
other phone, cable and programming companies are doing in superhighway 
test-beds throughout the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the company has already signaled its interest in providing information 
that others can relay to consumers. In January, Times Mirror joined with 
Pacific Telesis Group in a venture that will offer electronic-shopping 
services. In April, it invested in Digital Pictures Inc. of San Mateo, with 
plans to provide interactive versions of Times Mirror's magazines and 
newspapers to be distributed on CD-ROM. And distribution of an interactive 
version of the Los Angeles Times via Prodigy Services Co.'s on-line computer 
service is in the works. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, some analysts question the logic of dividing production from 
distribution, especially when cable generated 28% of Times Mirror's pretax 
operating profit last year -- nearly equal to the operating earnings of the 
newspaper group, which accounted for 53% of its revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 While the newspaper group's operating profit plunged to $107.3 million in 
1993, from $310 million in 1989, cable's earnings steadily climbed to $106.5 
million last year, from $58.1 million in 1989. (The profit figures take into 
account various restructuring charges.) 
</P>
<P>
 The loss of cable's profits "is a very valid concern" to Times Mirror going 
forward, said Douglas M. Arthur, an analyst with Kidder Peabody & Co. "Why sell 
it? Strategically, having the cable operation might be a great vehicle down the 
road." 
</P>
<P>
 But most analysts believe that consolidation in the cable industry is 
inevitable, as the race to rewire the nation with high-speed fiber cables 
requires bigger and bigger outlays of capital. And the consensus is that Times 
Mirror got a good price. 
</P>
<P>
 The spinoff will enable the firm to avoid a sharp tax bite that it would have 
incurred had the company sold the cable business for cash, and its transfer of 
debt to the new venture will vastly improve Times Mirror's balance sheet, 
analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
 Following the sale of the cable operations, Times Mirror said it expects to 
cut the quarterly dividend on its common stock to between one-fifth and 
one-third its current level of 27 cents. 
</P>
<P>
 Times Mirror will first spin off all of its businesses other than cable into 
the new Times Mirror company, and all Times Mirror shareholders will receive 
one new Class A or Class C common share for each share they owned in the old 
Times Mirror. Voting interests in the new Times Mirror will thus remain 
unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chandler family, the company's largest shareholder, which through two 
trusts owns over 50% of its voting stock, will not receive any shares of Cox 
Cable in the merger, because the terms of their trusts do not allow it. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, they will receive a new class of dividend-paying, non-voting 
preferred stock in Times Mirror, which will be equivalent to their 
proportionate interest in the stock distributed to other shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
 While many industry observers believed the Chandlers' desire for greater 
liquidity had fueled the search for a cable partner or buyer, Times Mirror 
executives said the Chandlers were not expected to sell their shares. 
</P>
<P>
 Cox Chairman James C. Kennedy will serve as chairman of the new combined cable 
systems and James O. Robbins, the current president of Cox Cable, will be 
president and chief executive officer. Erburu has been invited to take a seat 
on the firm's board of directors, but he said he has not yet responded to the 
offer. 
</P>
<P>

COLUMN ONE; AN UNEASY PASSAGE IN PANAMA; NEW LEADER ASSURES THE WORLD THAT HIS 
NATION WILL BE READY TO TAKE OVER THE CANAL AS DEADLINE NEARS. BUT MANY 
RESIDENTS SEE STABILITY AND PROFITS LEAVING WITH U.S. TROOPS.

<TEXT>
<P>
 You would think Jasmine Nelson, a Panamanian law student, would have more 
reasons than most people to want to see an end to 90 years of U.S. domination 
of her country. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, U.S. firepower destroyed her neighborhood during the 1989 invasion 
that ousted Gen. Manuel A. Noriega. She spent her formative years schooled in 
the anti-imperialist rhetoric of the 1980s. She believes that the Panama Canal 
ought to be run by Panamanians and that U.S. military installations that 
control her country's midsection are an affront to national sovereignty. 
</P>
<P>
 But she says she wants to be realistic. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the gringos go, there goes our economic stability," she says. "Without the 
dollar, we are nothing. We don't want the gringos to go." 
</P>
<P>
 For years, Panamanians dreamed of the day they would take charge of the canal 
and the acres of U.S.-controlled real estate attached to it. As the deadline 
for the hand-over inches closer, however, they are racked with doubts and fears 
about whether they are ready -- and whether perhaps they are losing more than 
they are gaining. 
</P>
<P>
 The election last month of a president whose government will handle most of 
the transition has focused new attention on Panama's spotty preparations to 
receive the canal and the network of U.S. military bases built along it. 
</P>
<P>
 President-elect Ernesto Perez Balladares promises a smooth transfer at 
century's close. But his words have yet to calm the uncertainty, which in many 
ways highlights the longstanding ambivalence Panamanians have felt toward the 
United States and toward their own sense of national identity. 
</P>
<P>
 Created as a nation so the canal could be built, Panama faces daunting 
questions about whether it can operate the waterway efficiently and properly 
develop the accompanying 500 square miles of land. And the departure of U.S. 
troops attached to the Panama-based U.S. Southern Command will mean a huge loss 
of income and jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Under 1977 treaties, the United States must hand over the canal and all 
property by Dec. 31, 1999; and all troops -- which until last week numbered 
close to 10,000 -- must leave by that date. 
</P>
<P>
 Governments until now have done little to get Panama ready. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the date for concluding the transfer may seem far off, the 
prerequisite changes are monumental. Only recently has the pace of both the 
turnover and the preparations quickened: A government commission has finally 
drafted a plan for the canal's future operation, and an autonomous agency is 
entertaining development projects for the land that is coming under Panamanian 
control. 
</P>
<P>
 As the first contingent of U.S. troops began pulling out Friday, senior U.S. 
officers said they hope that the withdrawal of the 193rd Infantry Brigade will 
force Panamanians to overcome their doubts and realize that the United States 
is serious about leaving. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue of Panama's readiness weighs heavily on governments such as Japan, 
whose trade relies on transit through the canal, and on the multibillion-dollar 
shipping industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet for thousands of workers who depend on the canal and the military bases, 
there are much more basic questions about jobs and livelihoods. Panama is home 
to multiple generations of both Panamanians and Americans whose lives are 
intertwined with the canal, and the world they have known is ending. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Beverly and Joe Wood are part of the dwindling community of Americans 
connected to the canal. Once called "Zonians," the Americans had numbered more 
than 4,000, but now there are fewer than 800. As the canal is transferred to 
Panamanian control, Americans are being phased out of the operation, and the 
Woods must leave their home next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Second-generation canal employees, the Woods had what they considered ideal 
lives, serving their country, serving the world and residing in paradise. They 
were born here and met, married and had children in the territory once known as 
the Panama Canal Zone -- a strip of land around the waterway that was 
physically part of Panama but that administratively belonged to the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a separate and privileged world of neat clapboard homes and manicured 
lawns lined with palm trees and orchids. The Zonians had their own schools, 
stores and hospitals -- a last bastion of U.S. colonialism that is fading. 
</P>
<P>
 The Woods, in essence, must find a new country. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whites who were in South Africa, the British who were in India . . . they 
probably had similar feelings," Joe Wood said, seated on the couch in his home 
in Balboa, once a part of the Zone off limits to Panamanians without special 
permits. "Our home is gone. Our kids can't come back. It's a wonderful life 
that is coming to an end." 
</P>
<P>
 The Zone was a country within a country, comfortable and insular to the 
Zonians inside but bitterly resented by Panamanians on the outside, who saw it 
as an affront to self-rule and self-respect. 
</P>
<P>
 Many Zonians never bothered to learn Spanish. Some were viewed as bumpkins or 
pampered snobs. Laws discriminating against blacks were maintained well into 
the 1970s. Panamanians could not drive in the Zone without a special driver's 
license. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be as if you were in L.A. and to use the Santa Monica Freeway you 
had to go to the Japanese Consulate to ask for a permit," said Panamanian 
sociologist Marco Gandasegui. "You'd wonder why. After a generation, that 
creates resentment." 
</P>
<P>
 Today's uncertainties fly in the face of the long-held Panamanian aspiration 
of taking control of the country's most valuable national resource. Gandasegui 
and other sociologists say many of the doubts expressed spring from a "culture 
of dependency" that the U.S. presence caused. 
</P>
<P>
 The Zone officially was dissolved as one of the first steps of the 1977 
treaties. Now called the Panama Canal Area, parts still belong to the United 
States, but it no longer has a separate U.S. governor or U.S. police force. 
Traffic signs are in Spanish and English. Some signs announce gasoline stations 
or stores that are "Open to the General Public." 
</P>
<P>
 Eighty-eight percent of the canal's employees are now Panamanian, and in 1990 
a Panamanian for the first time became administrator of the Panama Canal 
Commission, the U.S. federal agency that manages the 51-mile sea passage. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the treaties, the commission will cease to exist and land totaling 17% 
of national territory will revert to Panama as the U.S. Southern Command and 
its troops withdraw. Some estimates value the land -- which includes hundreds 
of vintage 1940s buildings and a corridor of triple-canopy jungle of exotic 
birds, big cats and lemurs -- at $30 billion, if developed wisely. Most of what 
has been transferred has been badly neglected. 
</P>
<P>
 What Panama loses, at least in the short term, is $300 million to $400 million 
in annual income and at least 4,000 well-paying jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Luis Salazar has spent 21 years collecting the trash and repairing the 
plumbing at Ft. Davis and Ft. Espinar on the Atlantic end of the canal, near 
the city of Colon. Like many Panamanians, he has little faith that the 
country's traditionally corrupt government can be trusted to administer the 
canal and the potential windfall from the land grants. 
</P>
<P>
 "They (government leaders) want more and more and more, and then they can't 
handle the burden," he said of the haphazard land acquisition. "Instead of 
moving forward, we are just falling behind." 
</P>
<P>
 Standing at Ft. Espinar, Salazar looked with disgust at the row of three-story 
barracks that once housed American troops, then Noriega's army, but that have 
remained empty for years. Since being turned over to the Panamanian government, 
the buildings have fallen into woeful disrepair. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearby is the original School of the Americas, the U.S. military's 
controversial training center for Latin armies for decades until its transfer 
to Ft. Benning, Ga., in 1984. The school was the center of a U.S. hemispherical 
military strategy aimed at fighting communism. The once-imposing building is a 
shambles; scavengers have chipped away the marble walls, and granite columns 
lie toppled on the ground, which is overgrown with willows and weeds. 
</P>
<P>
 Upkeep for the 10 bases still under U.S. control costs the American government 
$80 million a year. If structures are not maintained in the humid tropics, they 
are rapidly lost to the jungle. Panamanian officials contend they can't afford 
to pay for the maintenance. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they (the Panamanian government) can't take care of basic problems like 
garbage collection, how on earth can they take care of huge properties and the 
canal?" said Ray Bishop, former head of the union that represents Panamanian 
workers on the bases. 
</P>
<P>
 Bishop, a Panamanian whose grandparents came here from Jamaica to work on the 
canal, is lobbying Washington to renegotiate the transfer treaties. What most 
worries him is that the Panamanian elite will be the sole benefactors of the 
canal and properties, dividing the spoils among themselves. Until now, 
lucrative work on the bases gave people such as Bishop a middle-class status 
otherwise unattainable. 
</P>
<P>
 A Panamanian working on the bases earns an average of $1,200 a month, Bishop 
said. Similar jobs in Panama pay about $200 a month. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 When the United States finished construction of its canal in 1914, the 
waterway was hailed as one of the most spectacular engineering achievements of 
all time. To connect the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, about 75,000 men and 
women labored for 10 years, dredging and damming rivers, erecting locks and 
slicing through the Continental Divide. 
</P>
<P>
 The estimated 14,000 ships and vessels that cross the canal annually are 
lifted from sea level about 85 feet by three sets of locks. Remarkably, much of 
the equipment is original: 80-year-old, seven-story miter gates open and close 
the locks with apparent ease; 80-year-old bull wheels crank in place to fill 
the lock chambers with water. 
</P>
<P>
 The age of the equipment dramatizes how important maintenance is to the 
continued function of the canal, and the maintenance test is where Panama has 
failed. In addition to the barracks, the most notorious example is the Panama 
Canal railway. 
</P>
<P>
 Reverted to Panama's control in 1979, the railway's payroll doubled almost 
overnight while service declined. For upkeep, the Americans had paid machete 
crews to cut the tropical grass; the Panamanians simply burned the grass, which 
gradually weakened the rails. Today, much of the train system's rusted wagon 
cars lie in heaps good for little more than scrap metal. 
</P>
<P>
 Similar examples of mismanagement are easy to find. Engine-repair and 
bunkering industries shut down when transferred to Panama's control. Many of 
the canal houses that reverted to Panama were awarded on a somewhat 
questionable basis, often going to Noriega's mistresses or cronies. 
</P>
<P>
 Joaquin J. Vallarino, one of Panama's richest men and head of the presidential 
commission assigned to draft a transition plan for the canal, acknowledged that 
doubts about Panama are justified. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many things were done badly . . . (on) both sides," Vallarino said. "The 
Panamanians themselves have doubts. They are frightened. But it is perfectly 
within the capacity of Panamanians (to manage the canal), as long as it is not 
politicized." 
</P>
<P>
 Valuable time was lost, he said, because of the tensions between the Noriega 
regime and the Americans. And Panama was not prepared to begin absorbing land 
until now. A new 99-page plan released last month finally lays the groundwork 
for canal transition. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the May presidential election, voters restored Noriega's old political 
party to power just four years after it was dumped in disgrace after the U.S. 
invasion. The new government takes office in September and will rule until 
September, 1999. 
</P>
<P>
 As its current standard-bearer, Perez Balladares swears the party has been 
cured of its Noriega past. The smooth transfer of the canal will be completed 
on schedule, he promised. 
</P>
<P>
 "On Dec. 31, 1999, we and the (Americans) will have a party, and the rest of 
the world won't even notice there was a transition," Perez Balladares said. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the transfer is fraught with complex problems. Because the canal is 
run by a U.S. federal agency, its employees are civil servants with pay scales 
and merit systems that do not exist under Panamanian law. If the canal 
operation were to be brought under Panama's normal government structure, it 
could be bogged in the same bureaucracy that cripples much of the state. Panama 
will have to rewrite its constitution to adjust for these changes. 
</P>
<P>
 Another fear is that Panamanian officials, who will be under enormous 
financial pressure, will be tempted to raise the tolls for passage through the 
canal. Experts familiar with the canal's operation say that increasing tolls by 
more than 10% or 15% could make alternative routes more affordable and more 
appealing. 
</P>
<P>
 "The customers are the Toyotas and the Mitsubishis and the Philips of the 
world," said Courtney E. Prisk, an American management consultant. "They can 
afford to say: 'I'm tired of dealing with Panama. Dig me another canal. Or put 
a railroad through Nicaragua.' The Panamanians have to understand that the 
canal is a revenue source only as long as it is managed like a mature industry 
and not a growth industry. It cannot be seen as a cash cow." 
</P>
<P>
 The canal has already lost some of its importance to the United States. Half 
of the cargo that once passed through en route for the U.S. East Coast now 
arrives at West Coast ports and crosses over land. And 6% of ships afloat today 
simply do not fit in the canal. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, traffic has grown steadily, if slowly, over the years, and a boom in 
trade between the Pacific Rim and the markets of eastern South America and the 
west coast of Africa is expected to sustain demand for the canal. 
</P>
<P>
 Panama has not yet drawn up plans for the development of the land it is 
receiving, although the new Regional Interoceanic Authority in April chose a 
firm to detail a master plan. The idea that is mentioned with the most 
enthusiasm involves converting Ft. Amador, a picturesque peninsula at the 
Pacific mouth of the canal, into a world-class tourist resort. 
</P>
<P>
 The site is beautiful, with a view of the Bridge of the Americas, and the goal 
is to capture income from the many cruise ships that cross the canal but never 
deposit their tourists on Panamanian soil. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is Panama's historical moment," said Margaret E. Scranton, a University 
of Arkansas political scientist and a Panama expert. "Panama must rise to the 
occasion. If they botch this, they will never forgive themselves, and the world 
community will never forgive them. The Panama Canal will become an interesting 
historical artifact, like the pyramids, like the dinosaurs."

PRIMARY RACES POINT TOWARD DECISION DAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CATHLEEN DECKER and BILL STALL, TIMES POLITICAL WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Millions of dollars have been spent, hundreds of campaign appearances have 
been made, and California's primary campaign all boils down to Tuesday, when 
voters will cast ballots that give some politicians life until November and 
exile the rest to electoral anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
 Democrats could nominate their second straight woman for the governorship, if 
front-runner Kathleen Brown beats back the last-minute efforts of John 
Garamendi and Tom Hayden. 
</P>
<P>
 Republicans will vote yea or nay on the tenure of incumbent Gov. Pete Wilson, 
who has presided during a long string of natural and economic disasters. The 
state's hardiest political figure, Wilson finds himself under assault from 
political neophyte Ron Unz. 
</P>
<P>
 Also included on the statewide ballot are contests for party nominations to 
the U.S. Senate seat now held by Democrat Dianne Feinstein, seven other 
statewide offices and nine propositions. 
</P>
<P>
 The various contests, which have grown substantially hotter in recent days 
with the release of negative campaign commercials, apparently have not yet 
caught the fancy of voters. Acting Secretary of State Tony Miller predicted the 
lowest turnout for a regular state election since figures were first compiled 
in 1916 -- 39.8% 
</P>
<P>
 The previous low turnout for a gubernatorial primary was 40.45% in 1986, 
followed closely by 41.49% in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Campaign officials, however, characterized the electorate as more angry than 
apathetic. 
</P>
<P>
 "Voters are very angry and they are very scared," said Darry Sragow, 
Garamendi's campaign manager. "What people are scared about is the economic 
future of California and their own safety." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the economy and crime have dominated the gubernatorial campaign, both 
on the Republican and the Democratic sides. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown, the daughter and sister of the only Democratic governors to lead the 
state in the last half a century, started the race as the favorite and ends it 
that way, although her path has been littered by potholes. In the fall, she was 
criticized as wishy-washy, so she launched a series of multi-point issue 
speeches. In the spring, she was criticized as floundering, so she signed up a 
new campaign management team. During April's Democratic convention, Brown 
unveiled her new slogan -- "America's best treasurer to revive America's worst 
economy" -- and what she termed her "mission" -- to create at least 1 million 
new jobs in the next four years. 
</P>
<P>
 For most of the campaign, she ignored her Democratic counterparts to focus on 
Wilson. But Insurance Commissioner Garamendi consistently bad-mouthed Brown as 
a candidate who wanted to be governor simply to complete the family dynasty. 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi, however, has been hobbled by a lack of money, which prompted him 
last month to loan his campaign more than $500,000. He has used it to finance 
commercials accusing Brown of not being sufficiently supportive of the death 
penalty. Brown said she personally opposes capital punishment but would carry 
it out as governor. 
</P>
<P>
 The insurance commissioner spent much of his time during the campaign on "work 
days," in which he took over the jobs of ordinary Californians to illustrate 
his campaign slogan "Make California Work." But he and the second major 
Democratic challenger, state Sen. Tom Hayden of Santa Monica, are facing an 
uphill battle against the well-financed Brown campaign and the recent tendency 
of Democratic primary voters to side with women candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 Hayden's campaign has been unorthodox since its surprise beginning, when he 
dove into the race as a messenger of reform. Throughout the campaign, he has 
argued that California's political system is so dependent on money from special 
interests that the needs of its residents are forgotten. 
</P>
<P>
 In the process, Hayden has made himself something of an elder statesman, both 
for being above the Brown-Garamendi fray and for tackling more than the others 
the hardest issue to face the next governor -- the deficit-ridden budget. 
</P>
<P>
 On the Republican side, Wilson found himself with a surprisingly tenacious 
opponent, Unz. The Silicon Valley computer magnate largely financed his own 
campaign, which was heavy on hard-hitting commercials accusing Wilson of 
abandoning Republicans by raising taxes and allowing crime to proliferate. 
</P>
<P>
 Apart from a single radio debate, Unz has been ignored by the governor's 
campaign, which contends that his criticisms will fade before November. 
</P>
<P>
 The governor himself spent the primary season taking early shots at Brown, 
often focusing on the issue of illegal immigration. Wilson advocates amending 
the U.S. Constitution so that children born of illegal immigrants on American 
soil are not automatically U.S. citizens. Brown and the other Democrats oppose 
such a change. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Wilson and Brown have argued that the federal government should assume 
the costs of illegal immigration into California, since it is charged with 
protecting the borders. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the governor's race, the contest for nominations to the U.S. Senate has 
been marked by candidates who virtually skipped the preliminaries and began 
contesting the general election. 
</P>
<P>
 On the Republican side, one-term Rep. Michael Huffington, a millionaire who 
moved to Santa Barbara several years ago from Texas, has ignored his party 
opponent, former U.S. Rep. William Dannemeyer. The tactic was so pronounced 
that Dannemeyer took to sending out missing person reports about the elusive 
Huffington. 
</P>
<P>
 Dannemeyer, a Fullerton resident, is making his second consecutive run for the 
Senate; in 1992, he lost the Republican primary to appointed Sen. John Seymour. 
As he did in that campaign, he has stuck this year to a few favorite issues. He 
says that his opponent's socially moderate views are wrong, and that he would 
guard against wasteful spending. 
</P>
<P>
 Like it or not, however, Dannemeyer has been ignored by Huffington, who set 
his sights on Feinstein. The 46-year-old Huffington has spent millions of his 
own money in advertisements targeting Feinstein's votes for the Clinton 
economic plan and criticizing her as a career politician. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein, who has no major challengers for the Democratic nomination, ignored 
Huffington's gibes for months. But last week, with her poll numbers falling as 
a result of the assault, she went on the air with an ad that characterized 
Huffington as a Texas carpetbagger who dodged California income taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 She based her contention on the fact that Huffington and his wife claimed 
separate residences from 1988 to 1991 -- with Arianna Stassinopolous Huffington 
living in California and her husband in Texas, a state that has no income tax. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington quickly responded with a television commercial questioning whether 
she has paid enough federal taxes. Neither campaign has evidence of wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
 While the two big-ticket races have dominated news coverage during the primary 
season, they are far from the only matters on the ballot. Nominations for six 
of the seven other statewide offices are still open this year, because of the 
decisions by some state officeholders, such as Brown and Garamendi, to seek 
higher office and the retirement of others. 
</P>
<P>
 The highest profile among the down-ticket races has been achieved in the 
mud-splattered contest for state treasurer, which on the Democratic side has 
pitted longtime state Senate leader David A. Roberti of Van Nuys against former 
state party chairman Phil Angelides. Gubernatorial candidate Brown is the 
current treasurer. 
</P>
<P>
 Angelides in late May unveiled the most controversial ad of the state office 
campaigns, a broadside that accused Roberti of placing into power in the 
Legislature three corrupt state senators "even though . . . he knew of their 
sleazy reputations." The three, Alan Robbins of Van Nuys, Paul B. Carpenter of 
Downey and Joseph Montoya of Whittier, have been convicted on corruption 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberti called the ad a "smear job." 
</P>
<P>
 Angelides also targeted for assault Roberti's opposition to abortion, implying 
that he condoned the slaying of a Florida abortion doctor. Roberti, the most 
prominent abortion opponent in the Legislature, responded that he was appalled 
at the shooting of Dr. David Gunn. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberti gained national fame this year when he won a recall election that had 
been largely financed by the national gun lobby, which he angered by proposing 
anti-assault weapon legislation. While he has had little money to press his 
case in television ads in this race, he is better known in voter-rich Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 On the Republican side, state Board of Equalization member Matt Fong is 
running unopposed. 
</P>
<P>
 The office of lieutenant governor is open for the first time in 12 years -- 
incumbent Leo McCarthy is retiring -- and that has spawned a Republican contest 
to challenge the presumptive Democratic nominee, state Controller Gray Davis. 
</P>
<P>
 State Sen. Cathie Wright of Simi Valley and Assemblyman Stan Statham of Oak 
Run both contend that they will strengthen the office, which has not had a 
history of being a launching pad to higher achievement. 
</P>
<P>
 In the contest to succeed the retired March Fong Eu as secretary of state, 
Republican Assemblyman Bill Jones of Fresno is unopposed for his party's 
nomination, but the contest for the Democratic nomination is fast and furious. 
Competing are acting Secretary Tony Miller, who is the first openly gay 
candidate in the United States to run for statewide office; Assemblywoman Gwen 
Moore, who has the party's endorsement, and former Los Angeles councilman and 
mayoral candidate Michael Woo. 
</P>
<P>
 All of the candidates for controller are playing to voters' concerns about 
waste in government by pledging that they will apply strict business practices 
to their handling of the office. 
</P>
<P>
 Vying for the Democratic nomination are Kathleen Connell, a former city of Los 
Angeles housing director; Don Perata, a veteran Alameda County supervisor, and 
Rusty Areias, a San Joaquin Valley assemblyman. Republicans running for the 
seat are John Morris, a Los Angeles shopping center investor, and former 
Assemblyman Tom McClintock of Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Whoever wins election as the state's second elected insurance commissioner -- 
gubernatorial candidate John Garamendi was the first -- will inherit a host of 
lawsuits, investigations and battles over insurance premiums. Nevertheless, a 
few major candidates are competing for the job. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Republicans, the major candidates are Assemblyman Charles W. (Chuck) 
Quackenbush of Cupertino; Wes Bannister, the 1990 nominee, and Jim Conran, 
former state Department of Consumer Affairs director. Democrats include state 
Sen. Art Torres of Los Angeles and his junior house colleague, Assemblyman Burt 
Margolin, also of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the other state offices, the post of superintendent of public 
instruction is nonpartisan. But that has not lessened the competition. Major 
candidates include Joseph Carrabino, former president of the state Board of 
Education; Delaine Eastin, an assemblywoman from Fremont; Maureen DiMarco, the 
state secretary for child development and education; Wilbert Smith, a Pasadena 
businessman, and Gloria Matta Tuchman, an Orange County school board member and 
teacher. 
</P>
<P>
 Only in the race for attorney general are the two nominations already 
determined. On the Republican side, incumbent Dan Lungren is seeking 
reelection. And on the Democratic side, 1990 nominee Arlo Smith dropped out of 
the race, paving the way for the nomination of Garden Grove Assemblyman Tom 
Umberg. 
</P>
<P>
 Voters will also find on their state ballots a host of measures, most of which 
involve new spending. Three are related to the Jan. 17 Northridge earthquake, 
which not only caused widespread damage but also raised concerns about the 
safety of existing buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 1A would approve the sale of $2 billion in bonds to pay the 
state's share of earthquake damage and to strengthen freeway bridges. 
Proposition 1B is a $1-billion issue that would improve seismic safety in and 
otherwise renovate elementary and high schools. Proposition 1C would sell $900 
million in bonds to strengthen and renovate California's college campuses. 
</P>
<P>
 There are also non-earthquake-related issues on the ballot. Most notable are 
Proposition 175, which would reinstate the $60 per person renter's credit, and 
Proposition 180, which would authorize $2 billion in bonds to buy parklands, 
historic sites and wildlife areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Some local races are contested on the ballot this year. Los Angeles will elect 
two supervisors, a sheriff and assessor.

BIKES HELP BERKELEY DELIVER ON POLICY; TRANSPORTATION: PLANNING COMMISSION 
SENDS PARCELS VIA A BUSINESS THAT USES BICYCLES. A SPOKESWOMAN SAYS THE CITY IS 
REDUCING AUTO TRAVEL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL MECHANIC, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dave Cohen peddles freight for the city of Berkeley . . . well, pedals it 
actually. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's Planning Commission has turned exclusively to human power for local 
package delivery, enlisting the services of an unusual new business that uses 
specially equipped bicycles to ferry freight as heavy as 200 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a win-win situation," said Berkeley's senior transportation planner, 
Susie Sanderson. "It's cheaper, it's entirely without environmental harm and it 
complies with the city's policy to minimize noise, conserve energy and 
emphasize non-auto travel." 
</P>
<P>
 Cohen is a 33-year-old environmental activist turned entrepreneur who founded 
the business with two friends. Wearing a T-shirt with the slogan "One Less 
Car," he scoots through traffic, carrying cargo on a curious contraption called 
a "long haul" bike. It is nearly eight feet long, with a large watertight 
container bolted between the seat and the front wheel. The month-old company, 
called PedEx, has two of them. 
</P>
<P>
 Cohen says PedEx is one of only two bicycle services in the nation that can 
handle such heavy loads. The other is the Center for Alternative Transport in 
Eugene, Ore. -- whose founder, Jan Vander Tuin, designed PedEx's $1,400 bikes. 
</P>
<P>
 David Blake, chairman of the city's Zoning Board, said he was all for bicycle 
delivery but worried that the PedEx contraptions would have trouble in the 
steep and winding Berkeley hills, where many board members reside. Cohen shrugs 
off that concern. 
</P>
<P>
 "I go up there all the time," even in the rain, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The company's prices are slightly less than most motorized services charge, 
saving the commission about $70 a month over its current courier. In an 
environmentally conscious city like Berkeley, an inexpensive, non-polluting 
parcel delivery service is a shoo-in. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our city manager expressed interest in the savings," said Planning Department 
fiscal officer Bob Fleischmann. "If we find this to be a success, we're going 
to notify other departments." 
</P>
<P>
 The Planning Commission business would bring only about $2,500 a year to the 
fledgling company, but it's a start. With its 43 boards and commissions, the 
city represents a potential gold mine for PedEx. 
</P>
<P>
 Company officials say they're not necessarily in business to make money. Cohen 
and co-founder David Carcia are longtime advocates of alternatives to the 
automobile. Cohen himself goes everywhere by bike. 
</P>
<P>
 "I look at people in cars and they look so unfortunate," he said. "We're 
trying to bring back a very old idea of using human power. I mean, we've almost 
forgotten we have bodies, pushing down little levers with our ankles in order 
to get around." 
</P>
<P>
 Cohen also runs an advocacy group called Auto-Free Bay Area, which recently 
sued the California Department of Transportation, joining several environmental 
groups in demanding that the department consider alternatives before proceeding 
with a project to widen Interstate 80. Carcia is treasurer of the San Francisco 
Bicycle Coalition, a bicycle advocacy group. Mike Studebaker, the third 
partner, runs the East Bay's only standard bike messenger service, which shares 
an office and dispatcher with PedEx. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the next few years, the three hope to expand into an environmental 
cooperative modeled on their counterpart in Eugene. 
</P>
<P>
 Their vision, the East Bay Center for Alternative Transport, would be a 
"unique combination of business and advocacy," said Cohen. The cooperative 
would operate PedEx and Studebaker Messenger Service, build human-powered 
vehicles for others, and lobby local governments on transportation policy 
issues and alternative city planning. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, Berkeley city officials have toyed with the idea of making 
portions of the city car-free, and UC Berkeley has become the first university 
in the country to convert to electric buses to shuttle students around campus. 
</P>
<P>
 But Cohen has even higher aspirations. He speaks of bicycle trailers and 
flatbeds, bikes powered by two or three riders and capable of 500-pound 
payloads, trans-Bay delivery services using public transportation as a link, 
and the use of pedicabs for local transportation rather than merely as a 
tourist attraction. 
</P>
<P>
 "People would laugh at these things now, but we won't survive without 
environmental solutions," said Cohen. "The whole idea is to have cities where 
the pedestrian is No. 1. That's the way cities used to be."

SURVEY FINDS LITTLE SUPPORT FOR RAMS; PRO FOOTBALL: VOTERS TELL TIMES ORANGE 
COUNTY POLL THEY DON'T WANT GOVERNMENT TO PAY TO KEEP THE TEAM IN ANAHEIM. A 
SIZABLE MINORITY DOUBT THAT LOSING THE RAMS WOULD HURT BUSINESS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Orange County voters have little interest in spending taxpayer money to keep 
the Los Angeles Rams in the county, reflecting their sense that the team's 
departure would not severely affect the county's image, according to a Times 
Orange County poll. 
</P>
<P>
 The poll, conducted by Mark Baldassare and Associates, found that only three 
in 10 county voters feel keeping the Rams is important to them personally, 
while nearly 70% say it is unimportant. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's not a whole lot of good will or good feeling toward the Rams," said 
Baldassare, who polled 600 Orange County registered voters from May 19 to 22 
for The Times. "It doesn't appear that people are interested in keeping the 
team." 
</P>
<P>
 The lack of support for the Rams is evenly spread, with little difference of 
opinion among age groups or between men and women. North county residents, 
however, are slightly more likely than those in the south county to say the 
team helps the economy. 
</P>
<P>
 The poll finds Anaheim city officials, who have been unwilling to spend 
taxpayer money to build the Rams a new stadium, in step with voter sentiment. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams exercised a 15-month escape clause in their Anaheim Stadium lease 
last month and are seeking offers to move the franchise to another state. Rams 
officials say their arrangement in Anaheim is not profitable and they want to 
move where they can make more money. 
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim city officials say they can't compete with the financial packages 
being put together by other cities -- such as Baltimore and St. Louis -- and 
have asked county government to chip in. 
</P>
<P>
 But voters apparently don't want the county government to get involved. 
</P>
<P>
 Fully three in four voters oppose having the county government provide 
financial assistance to keep the Rams; 21% favor some type of monetary support. 
</P>
<P>
 County residents are frustrated with the team's ownership, consecutive losing 
seasons, player personnel changes and the Rams' lack of commitment to the 
community, according to interviews with poll respondents. 
</P>
<P>
 "The present ownership has done a lousy job," said Alex Ribakoff, 40, an 
Irvine attorney. "I have a problem with government subsidies of sports 
franchises in general. I think the money spent never gets returned to the 
community." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams have made no effort to reach out to the community and even refused to 
change their name when they moved from Los Angeles, he said, adding, "I resent 
that. I frankly think (the Rams) are going to be replaced." 
</P>
<P>
 Alfred Srnka of Garden Grove said he would miss the team if it moves but does 
not believe the county should pay to keep the franchise. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to lose them, but I feel the ball teams are making enough 
money," said Srnka, 65, a real estate broker and polka-band member. "There's so 
much money in sports now that the owners should be able to take care of 
things." 
</P>
<P>
 Keri Owens, 21, of Anaheim said she does not think it is ethical to give money 
to the Rams "when there are so many other important things that need to be 
funded." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps significant in making up some people's minds is the belief, among a 
substantial minority, that the county's economic health is not tied to the 
team's staying. Some 37% say the team is unimportant to the local economy, with 
59% saying the Rams help the local economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Andrew Crowell said losing the team would be a damaging blow. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would have a great impact if they left," said Crowell, 62, of Laguna 
Beach. "I want to cut taxes, but I think there is enough money around to spend 
on the team. They bring in a lot of business to the county." 
</P>
<P>
 Crowell added: "I think the team is a good team. People can't expect them to 
win all the time." 
</P>
<P>
 To most, the prestige value of the team to the county is even less important 
than the team's economic benefits. Slightly more than four in 10 call the 
franchise important to the county's image, with 54% saying it is unimportant. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think it will matter much if they leave," Owens said. "It's not like 
we have a shortage of professional sports teams here. We have the (California) 
Angels and the Mighty Ducks hockey team. . . . It won't bother me at all if the 
Rams leave."

CAPITOL JOURNAL: DESPITE REFORM, 'JUICE' STILL OILS THE SYSTEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE SKELTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On the eve of an election -- and as we commemorate that great day for the 
forces of freedom at Normandy -- it is timely to note how democracy too often 
works in California's Capitol. 
</P>
<P>
 One example: 
</P>
<P>
 A veteran lobbyist recently noticed a minor tax break bill -- obviously 
written to benefit some special interest -- and wondered whether it might also 
help one of his business clients. So he called the legislative author and 
asked. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't know, the lawmaker replied; will check into it. 
</P>
<P>
 The next day, the lobbyist was contacted by his confused client. The 
legislator's fund-raiser had just called, the client reported, and asked for a 
campaign contribution. The fund-raiser had not mentioned the pending tax bill. 
That could have been illegal. But his implied message was obvious: Pay up if 
you want in on the action. 
</P>
<P>
 It's an all-too-common tale. This was a "juice bill" aimed at squeezing 
campaign donations from special interests looking to benefit from legislation. 
Other times, they'll pay protection money to be exempt from a bill's grasp. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of my clients think this government is for rent," laments the lobbyist, 
insisting on anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes it is. 
</P>
<P>
 Terry E. Frost, currently on trial in federal court for allegedly conspiring 
to commit extortion, told a wired FBI informant in 1988 how he operated as a 
Senate staffer raising money for Democrats: 
</P>
<P>
 "I (don't) twist arms. . . . I will not force people to give contributions. I 
explain political realities. And then if they say no, that's fine. . . . When 
they come to ask a favor, they can understand why I say no. Because I have to 
work with those people who are appreciative (of the Democratic) leadership." 
</P>
<P>
 At another point, Frost commented: "I won't sell the farm and compromise my 
principles totally. Partially, maybe." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The consensus of the Capitol community is that the place is less corrupt now 
than it was six years ago when the FBI raided some offices and disclosed that 
it had been conducting a sting operation. Four Los Angeles County legislators 
have been convicted and a fifth -- Sen. Frank Hill (R-Whittier) -- now is on 
trial with Frost. Several legislative aides, lobbyists and other officials also 
have been convicted. 
</P>
<P>
 "There certainly was a problem with some bad apples, but those bad apples have 
been turned into applesauce," says new Senate leader Bill Lockyer (D-Hayward). 
</P>
<P>
 One important reform was the banning of honorariums. The money often was given 
to a legislator for a speech, but too frequently simply was a payoff. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill got into trouble -- alleged extortion and money laundering -- because he 
took a $2,500 honorarium from an FBI agent posing as a Southern businessman. An 
honorarium, Hill told the jury, "was a way of augmenting our income." Hill 
pocketed his check after sitting in a hotel room for an hour and listening to 
the "businessman" drone on about duck hunting and air shows. 
</P>
<P>
 That kind of juice has dried up for legislators. It will be replaced next 
December by a 37% salary increase. An independent citizens commission, created 
by voters when honorariums were banned, recently voted to hike the lawmakers' 
annual pay from $52,500 to $72,000. 
</P>
<P>
 That makes for cleaner compensation. But it won't end corruption, because 
politicians still must grub for campaign contributions. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Legislators are becoming increasingly frantic about campaign money. One reason 
is that campaign costs keep climbing; in 1992, legislative candidates raised 
$72 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Another reason is that, because of term limits, seats are becoming more 
competitive. That's what voters wanted. But competitive seats cost more to run 
for. An unintended consequence of term limits is that many lawmakers aren't 
waiting around; they're vacating their seats -- making them competitive -- and 
running for a higher office. Then they must raise big bucks to campaign for 
that office. 
</P>
<P>
 The system is rotten for two basic reasons: 
</P>
<P>
 * Legislators spend too much time raising money -- time they should be 
devoting to public policy. (And it's not just legislators. Gov. Pete Wilson has 
raised an average of $45,000 per day since Jan. 1.) 
</P>
<P>
 * The money is solicited primarily from special interests. And it's special 
interests, therefore, that too often influence how politicians vote. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no perfect solution. But the best in my view is some form of partial 
public financing combined with limits on private contributions and candidate 
spending. That's the system we've had for the last five presidential campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
 People who object to spending tax money on politicians' campaigns should think 
of it as buying a better democracy.

 Twelve-year-old Vicki Van Meter soared up, up and away Sunday in a bid to 
cross the Atlantic in Amelia Earhart's path. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Meter took off from Augusta State Airport, circled about 200 well-wishers 
below and dipped her wings before heading toward her first stop in 
Newfoundland. 
</P>
<P>
 Her flight instructor is on board because she is too young to fly alone. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you put your mind to it, you can accomplish anything," the sixth-grader 
from Meadville, Pa., said before saying goodby to her parents and climbing into 
the single-engine plane, "Harmony." 
</P>
<P>
 The aspiring astronaut is following a flight path similar to Earhart's when 
she became the first woman to fly solo about 2,200 miles across the Atlantic in 
1932. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Meter took off from the Augusta airport in September for a trip that made 
her the youngest female to make a transcontinental flight. The four-leg trip 
ended in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 Kennebec Valley Chamber of Commerce President Peter Thompson said Van Meter 
could be the youngest person to attempt a transatlantic flight but that it is 
difficult to know because there are few records for pilots younger than 16, who 
are required to fly with an instructor.

DOLE REFUSES TO ENDORSE NORTH'S BID FOR SENATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENT JENKINS JR. and DONALD P. BAKER, THE WASHINGTON POST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One day after Oliver L. North won Virginia's GOP nomination for the U.S. 
Senate, Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole rained on North's victory celebration 
by refusing to endorse his fellow Republican and reaching out to potential 
North opponent J. Marshall Coleman. 
</P>
<P>
 Dole, of Kansas, said in a nationally televised interview Sunday that "it's 
going to take a while" before he decides whether to support North, and that 
North's victory "makes it very difficult for some in the Republican Party" to 
stay loyal. 
</P>
<P>
 He also said he plans to meet this week with Coleman, a former state attorney 
general who appears likely to bolt the Republican Party and run for the Senate 
as an independent. Although Dole said "I don't know what (Coleman) has to say," 
some political analysts immediately interpreted the meeting as a highly public 
slap at North. 
</P>
<P>
 North received more unwelcome news from another Republican senator, John 
McCain of Arizona, and from the man he beat Saturday, former federal budget 
director James C. Miller III. Both offered North tepid support, but McCain, 
appearing with Dole on the CBS News program "Face the Nation," said he believes 
North is a weak candidate. Miller, in remarks to reporters after a GOP 
breakfast here Sunday morning, said he has no plans to campaign for North. 
</P>
<P>
 In a news conference Sunday, North minimized the statements by Dole and 
McCain, noting that they came from two lawmakers "neither of whom are running 
in Virginia." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm running for the families of Virginia," he said. "I'm not running anywhere 
else but Virginia." 
</P>
<P>
 North had hoped to start his general election drive on an emotional high note 
Sunday, attending a "unity breakfast" with Virginia Republicans and beginning a 
four-day bus tour through rural Virginia. He vowed to press ahead, even though 
his hoped-for political honeymoon lasted less than 18 hours. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only thing that's going to slow this parade down," North said, "is a flat 
tire between here and Danville." 
</P>
<P>
 The criticism of North by senior members of his own party "is simply 
remarkable," said Robert Holsworth, a political scientist at Virginia 
Commonwealth University. "North's candidacy is already becoming a national 
issue. . . . You have an extraordinarily divided Republican Party in Virginia 
at the moment. (North) is perhaps the most polarizing figure on the political 
scene." 
</P>
<P>
 North and Coleman are only two contenders in what could become an 
unprecedented four-man field in this year's Virginia Senate race. Democratic 
incumbent Charles S. Robb faces three underdog challengers in a party primary 
election June 14. If Robb wins, former Gov. L. Douglas Wilder appears likely to 
break away from the Democrats and mount his own campaign as an independent. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton said Sunday he believes Robb will be reelected. 
</P>
<P>
 "Col. North represents a clear choice for the people of Virginia and a clear 
triumph for the radical right," Clinton said in an interview with ABC News 
aboard the aircraft carrier George Washington. "And my guess is that the people 
of Virginia, once they see what their stark choices are, will choose Sen. 
Robb."

SEVERAL KEY RULINGS WILL FILL HIGH COURT'S FINAL DAYS; LAW: JUSTICES HAVE LEFT 
SOME OF THE TOUGHEST CASES FOR LAST. DECISIONS ON ABORTION PROTESTS, THE DEATH 
PENALTY, TAXES AND VOTING RIGHTS REMAIN.

<P>
 On a Thursday afternoon in late May, the justices of the Supreme Court 
gathered in an ornate conference room for a music recital. 
</P>
<P>
 Justice Harry A. Blackmun, who had conceived the idea and invited six 
distinguished musicians, said he thought listening to music together would have 
a salutary impact on his often-combative colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
 The recital and the reception that followed would "increase the level of 
joviality among the justices at this time of year," Blackmun commented in 
introducing the program. 
</P>
<P>
 For the high court, "this time of the year" is decision time. In the last week 
of May and first weeks of June, the justices must finally decide their cases, 
some of which have been pending since the first week in October. 
</P>
<P>
 Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, a stickler for working by the clock, 
insists that all the opinions be ready for announcement by the last week in 
June. While the court has heard fewer cases during this term, it now finds 
itself in the usual spot -- with some of the hardest cases left for last. 
</P>
<P>
 Here are highlights among the 35 cases still awaiting decision: 
</P>
<P>
 CABLE TV -- Does the 1992 law that requires local cable television operators 
to broadcast virtually all nearby over-the-air stations violate the 1st 
Amendment rights of the cable companies? If the justices agree with the 
industry, the ruling in the case of Turner Broadcasting System Inc. vs. the 
Federal Communications Commission could have broad impact in the communications 
field. 
</P>
<P>
 ABORTION PICKETING -- Can a judge block anti-abortion protesters from 
picketing and praying at the gates of an abortion clinic, or does such an order 
violate their free-speech rights? A ruling in the case of Madsen vs. Women's 
Health Center could affect the constitutionality of the newly enacted federal 
law designed to protect abortion facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 DEATH PENALTY -- Is California's death penalty law unconstitutional because it 
permits jurors to consider vague factors when deciding upon a sentence of life 
in prison or death for a convicted killer? A ruling in Tuilaepa vs. California 
could affect the fate of the state's 375 inmates on Death Row, but the justices 
indicated during the March arguments in the case that they are likely to uphold 
the law. 
</P>
<P>
 RELIGION -- Can a state carve out a special school district to serve a 
separatist religious sect? If the answer is yes in this New York case, other 
sects are likely to seek the same benefits. But the ruling in the Village of 
Kiryas Joel vs. Grumet is likely to be narrowly focused and will not have a 
broad impact on other cases involving the separation of church and state. 
</P>
<P>
 UNITARY TAXES -- Is California's now-repealed unitary tax on multinational 
corporations unconstitutional? A loss in the case of Barclay's Bank vs. 
Franchise Tax Board could cost the state as much as $4 billion, but during oral 
arguments, the justices sounded as though they will reject the bank's claim. 
</P>
<P>
 VOTING RIGHTS -- Is a state required to maximize the number of legislative 
seats for blacks and Latinos when drawing boundaries for voting districts? This 
case from Florida raises a series of complicated questions because benefiting 
blacks can hurt Latinos and vice versa. The justices heard arguments in Johnson 
vs. DeGrandy on the first Monday in October but have struggled since then to 
issue a decision. 
</P>
<P>
 SIGNS -- Can a city outlaw the display of all signs and billboards, except 
those necessary to identify a residence or business? If the court were to rule 
for the city in Ladue, Mo., vs. Gilleo, officials would have far broader 
authority to ban billboards and other "visual clutter." 
</P>
<P>
 RETROACTIVE TAXES -- Can Congress repeal a tax benefit after a taxpayer has 
taken advantage of it and order the Internal Revenue Service to seek 
retroactive payments? Since the 1930s, the high court has given state and 
federal officials broad powers to impose retroactive taxes, but the case of 
U.S. vs. Carlton has forced the justices to rethink that doctrine. 
</P>
<P>
 PROPERTY RIGHTS -- Can city officials force a store owner to give up some of 
his property for use as a bike path as a condition of getting a building 
permit, or is that requirement an unconstitutional "taking" of private 
property? In a 1987 case involving a Ventura beachfront home, the high court 
said it would frown on a public agency's demands that amounted to "extortion" 
of property owners, but the justices have been unable to agree on a clear 
standard.

AMERICAN ALBUM: FRONTIER TOWN MAKES WAY FOR NEW PIONEERS; PRESCOTT, ARIZ., IS A 
FAST-GROWING RETIREMENT MECCA. BUT THE CITY'S LONGTIME RESIDENTS ARE WARY. 
</P>

<P>
 Once a brash, bawdy territorial capital -- where the faces of its painted 
women rivaled the brilliant hues of its majestic Granite Mountain Wilderness -- 
Prescott has been metamorphosed into a tranquil valley where California equity 
barons battle longtime landowners for available space. 
</P>
<P>
 Where ranchers and miners once shook hands on business deals in bars decorated 
with cattle horns, an older generation of Americans has come to look on this 
city of 29,000 as a retirement mecca. 
</P>
<P>
 They arrive by the dozens -- sometimes hundreds each month. Especially since 
Money magazine earlier this year proclaimed Prescott, with its temperate 
climate and intemperate history, the most desirable area in the country for 
those seeking affordable respite from teeming cities and soaring crime rates. 
</P>
<P>
 Peggy Collins, tourism director for Prescott's Chamber of Commerce, notes with 
satisfaction that phone inquiries are up 33% over 1993 and mail responses have 
risen 240%. 
</P>
<P>
 But many in what may be the last major true frontier city in the West do not 
share her good humor. There are new Prescott-ites, caught in an inflationary 
spiral that threatens their Social Security income, who prefer that the 
spotlight on their city quickly fade. And there's an equal or greater number of 
Prescott pioneers who share that sentiment. 
</P>
<P>
 Founded in 1864 as the first territorial capital of Arizona, Prescott -- 
despite its reputation for hangings and gunfights -- has always had a softer 
side. 
</P>
<P>
 The women's Monday Club began collecting for a Carnegie Library that today 
boasts a 110,000-volume collection that much larger cities would envy. 
</P>
<P>
 There are museums, concert halls, a community college, a liberal arts college 
and an aeronautical university. Victorian homes are restored and open for 
tours. 
</P>
<P>
 College students make up the vast majority of Prescott's working class -- 
earning $4 to $5 an hour at grocery stores, hotels and gas stations. The other 
end of the economic scale belongs to those whose fathers and grandfathers 
staked out the wilderness and then subdivided it into great wealth. 
</P>
<P>
 "There really isn't (much of) a middle class," says L.W. (Budge) Ruffner, 
whose family roots here date to the post-Civil War days and who is a Western 
historian of some note, Those arriving add to the disparity. They include 
Californians and others with hundreds of thousands of equity dollars in the 
modern equivalent of their saddlebags. Other newcomers bring only fixed 
pensions and optimism. All are greeted by real estate agents known for 
elevating prices when out-of-town license plates are spotted on the curving 
highway leading to the top of the mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 And while Prescott's growth is limited by the mountains that encircle it, 
Prescott Valley (once known more improperly as Jackass Flats) remains there for 
the taking. Today it is the third-fastest-growing area in Arizona, Collins 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 The 150-member Yavapai tribe, indigenous to the Prescott area, is making its 
presence known by licensing a giant shopping center and hotel complete with 
gambling on its reservation. But Prescott will see little if any tax revenue 
from the shoppers and gamblers because the center sits on federal land. 
</P>
<P>
 Prescott's antecedents are a glossary of things as varied as the landscape 
itself: 
</P>
<P>
 * The Samuel Hill Hardware store is supposedly the source of the old 
expression, "What the Sam Hill?" -- a phrase that was a tribute to Hill's 
floor-to-ceiling inventory of almost everything imaginable. 
</P>
<P>
 * Barry Goldwater thought of Prescott as his good-luck city and launched his 
political campaigns there. 
</P>
<P>
 * Fiorello LaGuardia spent much of his high school years in Prescott, where 
his Army officer father was stationed as the local military bandmaster. He and 
Ruffner's father became friends, and Ruffner fought for years to build a 
lasting monument to the former New York mayor. Today there rises above Granite 
Creek a bridge named in his honor. 
</P>
<P>
 * Sinclair Lewis also would have loved Prescott; there is a tribe of Babbitts 
entwined in the city's past whose descendants include Interior Secretary Bruce 
Babbitt. 
</P>
<P>
 So Prescott sits poised between its past -- where tour groups today are told 
that the old whorehouse above the Palace Bar (opened in 1901) was a "hotel" -- 
and its present, where its reputation as a mecca for retirees threatens to push 
its average age to a statistic rivaling the elevation of the local mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 So if you wish to help those who pine for the past, forget you read this. 
</P>
<P>
 But if you promise not to tell, it still is a city where people actually turn 
around when your car alarm goes off.

 Dear Mom, 
</P>
<P>
 By the time you get this, me and the guys will already (hopefully) be up on 
the bluff above Omaha Beach -- in France! -- so I guess I don't have to worry 
about the censors anymore. 
</P>
<P>
 The old man says we sail tonight -- even though the weather doesn't look too 
good -- so I wanted to share with you some of the special moments we've had 
these last few days serving under Supreme Allied Commander William J. (Clint) 
Clinton and his battle-hardened staff. 
</P>
<P>
 It's been real interesting. Just in the last three days, we've killed off the 
British prime minister, wounded the president of Italy and argued with the Pope 
-- the Pope! -- in his own house. But I'll tell you about all that later. 
</P>
<P>
 As I write this, I'm sitting in Portsmouth in a cold pub drinking warm beer. 
The next bar we see hopefully will be in Paris. 
</P>
<P>
 Clint and the Queen are out sailing around the harbor blessing the fleet in 
her huge yacht. It's probably worth more than everything in Hickory Falls 
combined. There's hundreds of boats out there getting ready to go to Normandy 
tomorrow. It's pretty sad to think that some of them won't be coming back. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyways, I got a glimpse of Her Majesty this morning and she seems like a 
pretty nice girl, even though she's kind of old and she always wears these 
funny hats. 
</P>
<P>
 They had a religious service this morning they call a Drumhead Ceremony that 
goes back to the Middle Ages where they bless the warriors going off to battle. 
There were a bunch of archbishops and generals there, and it was neat to see 
the ships in the harbor behind them and know that in a few hours we'd all be 
headed for Normandy. 
</P>
<P>
 There were ceremonies all day -- I think they do all that stuff to take our 
minds off what's going to happen tomorrow. Most of the guys are pretty nervous, 
and you should hear some of the mean things they say about Clint in the mess 
when none of the officers are around, like how did he get four stars and he 
doesn't even know how to salute right and a lot of the top people around him 
are jerks. There's a lot of personal stuff too, that I won't repeat for your 
tender ears. 
</P>
<P>
 But back to the things that happened the last few days. 
</P>
<P>
 Clint went to the Air Corps cemetery in Cambridge on Saturday to lay some 
wreaths and make a speech and then later met with this woman who I guess runs 
the Labor Party here, Margaret Beckett. They're kind of like the Democrats back 
home, and he wanted to talk to her about health care and stuff, I guess. 
Anyway, they handed out this press release about her and it said that she took 
over the party after John Major died last month. Ha! John Major is the prime 
minister -- a Conservative too -- and he was perfectly alive when we saw him 
yesterday. They must have meant John Smith, the Labor guy who really did die in 
May. 
</P>
<P>
 That Clint, he's got some real crackerjacks on his G-2 (intelligence) staff. 
</P>
<P>
 Clint went over to Italy a few days ago to do another cemetery thing and he 
had Jesse Brown, the head of Veterans Affairs, introduce the Italian president, 
a fellow named Oscar Luigi (really) Scalfaro. Anyways, Brown stumbled all over 
Scalfaro's name, finally coming out with something that sounded like 
Scal-a-far-do. Some of the Italians there kind of giggled, which I thought was 
rude because it's really impossible to pronounce most of their words. 
</P>
<P>
 When he was in Italy, Clint also went over to the Vatican to visit the Pope. 
The papers said they got into another argument about abortion and birth 
control. I can't figure out why Clint feels he has to bring this up. It's not 
like the Pope is going to change his mind on this. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, I've got to repack my stuff (for about the hundredth time) and go get on 
that horrible boat. I'm glad this is about to happen, even though it is pretty 
scary considering how messed up all the preliminaries have been. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the guy said, war is heck. But the chow's been pretty good, especially in 
Italy. I'll probably lose it all on the Channel. 
</P>
<P>
 Love, 
</P>
<P>
 Your war hero son.

EC CHIEF CALLS FASCISM IN ITALY 'A HIDEOUS BEAST'

<P>
 European Commission President Jacques Delors hit out at neo-fascists in 
Italy's new government, saying the country had been contaminated by "a hideous 
beast." 
</P>
<P>
 Delors was asked in an interview about published remarks by Italian 
neo-fascist leader Gianfranco Fini, who said the June, 1944, D-day landings 
marked the loss of Europe's cultural identity. 
</P>
<P>
 "I read that with rage in my heart," Delors said. "(Fini) even added that 
until 1938, when (Fascist dictator Benito) Mussolini passed racist laws, 
fascism could not be considered negative." 
</P>
<P>
 At stake, Delors said, was "the rejection of others, of he who does not have 
the same opinion as you, the same religion, or whose skin is a different 
color." 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the new hideous beast which threatens Europe. It is already at work 
in former Yugoslavia, but it is also at work contaminating Western Europe," he 
said.

IT'S JUST ANOTHER DAY IN GERMANY; D-DAY: THERE WILL BE NO CEREMONIES OR MOMENTS 
OF SILENCE. CITIZENS HAVE 'MIXED FEELINGS,' AND BONN PREFERS TO 'LOOK FORWARD.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A small building set in a grove of chestnut trees on Berlin's once-grand Unter 
den Linden houses Germany's central war memorial: Inside its walls, heavily 
incised by machine-gun fire from half a century ago, stands a single bronze 
sculpture of a woman cradling the body of her son. "To the victims of war and 
tyranny," reads the inscription. 
</P>
<P>
 If there were any interest on the part of Germans in commemorating the 
Normandy landings today, it ought to be evident here. Young men drafted into 
Hitler's Wehrmacht were, after all, victims of war -- about 100,000 German 
soldiers died in the two months it took the Allies to consolidate a front in 
northern France. 
</P>
<P>
 But in unavoidable contrast to the surging crowds and victors' pageantry 
marking D-day's 50th anniversary day 700-odd miles to the west, this shrine 
stands silent and largely empty. A little rain falls through the open-air 
skylight above the sculpture; a few wilted bouquets lie on the stone floor in 
front of the statue; visitors trickle silently in and out the door. That is 
all. 
</P>
<P>
 "Germany looks at the D-day festivities with mixed feelings," noted Klaus 
Bering of the German news agency Deutsche Presse-Agentur. "While the Allies 
celebrate, the Germans are just watching from the sidelines." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, there are no ceremonies in Germany today, no government 
pronouncements, no scheduled moment of silence. 
</P>
<P>
 German television is airing "The Longest Day," and a few German veterans are 
making independent pilgrimages to the French beaches, but on the whole, the 
proceedings that have captured so much attention in the United States have made 
for a virtual non-event here. 
</P>
<P>
 True, for Germany, the landings in Normandy were really just a sideshow to the 
1942-43 Battle of Stalingrad, which for this country was the turning point of 
World War II. And Germany doesn't commemorate that high-casualty catastrophe 
either, because the Allied occupiers banned veterans groups here in the first 
years after the war, and a clubby veterans tradition has not flourished in 
Germany the way it has in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 But Germany's reluctance to note the passing of the D-day anniversary is more 
than just a reflection of how few veterans groups there are or of how much 
greater emphasis Germans place on the Eastern Front than on France. 
</P>
<P>
 It is also a reflection of Germany's everlasting struggle to come to terms 
with its past. Even 50 years of good relations with the Western democracies and 
a successful grafting of democratic tissue onto the German character have not 
been enough to erase the horror of the Third Reich. 
</P>
<P>
 So reluctant are most Germans today to connect with their collective past that 
they are slow even to salute their dead. 
</P>
<P>
 In Bonn, for instance, there were hurt feelings when the French left 
Chancellor Helmut Kohl off the official Normandy guest list. Yet Kohl merely 
responded that he hadn't wanted to go to Normandy anyway, and he went on to 
forbid German diplomats to participate in most D-day events. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let these people celebrate this day," Kohl said in a recent interview with 
the British Broadcasting Corp. "Let the survivors commemorate it in honor of 
their fallen comrades. . . . This is no day for us Germans to join in the 
commemoration." 
</P>
<P>
 The symbol-loving Kohl will, however, meet with French President Francois 
Mitterrand just two days after the D-day ceremonies, during a youth festival in 
Heidelberg. And he has said German diplomats may attend events in France if 
they lack a military character and "look forward to the future." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, to the extent there has been any discussion of D-day among German 
commentators in the last week, virtually all of it has "looked forward," 
dealing with the years since World War II and not the war years themselves, or 
any other aspect of National Socialism. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the commentary has been upbeat, concentrating on the achievements of 
the last half-century, the fruitful association with the United States and 
calling the fall of the Third Reich a "liberation" for Germans too. 
</P>
<P>
 But a recent survey highlights the difficulty Germans still have, half a 
century after the war, in coming to grips with the rise of Hitler and agreeing 
upon what it may say about German society. 
</P>
<P>
 When asked who was to blame for the start of World War II, 56% of those 
surveyed named Germany, but a full quarter said they blamed "the confused 
international situation." 
</P>
<P>
 More than 90% said they had no doubt that the Nazi Holocaust had really 
happened, but when asked how they viewed the political concepts of the Nazis, 
nearly a quarter -- 24% -- said they were "not so bad at all." 
</P>
<P>
 The German weekly Die Woche, which published the survey results, called this 
level of tolerance for Nazi ideology alarming and noted that the only good 
thing about such a figure was that it was smaller than it had been in previous 
surveys. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1955, according to Die Woche, almost half of West Germans said they would 
have considered Hitler a great statesman if he hadn't tried to wipe out the 
Jews. In 1989, another survey turned up 46% of Germans saying they could find 
some good things about National Socialism.

FEUDING KURDISH FACTIONS SWALLOW PRIDE, TALK PEACE; IRAQ: FIGHTING PLACED 
WESTERN AGENCIES PROTECTING KURDS FROM SADDAM HUSSEIN IN AN AWKWARD POSITION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HUGH POPE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Feasting away their differences in a gloomy northern Iraq hotel, the leaders 
of Iraq's two feuding Kurdish armies embraced and held their first talks Sunday 
on ending a five-week conflict that has deeply embarrassed the Western forces 
and aid agencies protecting their enclave from Iraqi President Saddam Hussein. 
</P>
<P>
 But first it took a bearhug from a dissident Iraqi general to force a 
reluctant Masoud Barzani to embrace his rival, Jalal Talabani. The two men, 
however, agreed to further peace measures and expressed their hopes that 
fighting among the separatist rebels that has killed up to 400 people is now 
over. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our relationship is stronger than a kiss," Talabani quipped before standing 
with his rival at the head of a long table loaded with rice, kebabs, chicken 
and stews for the feast that traditionally signifies the end of Kurdish blood 
feuds. "We want to consolidate peace and to restore our alliance and our 
struggle against dictatorship." 
</P>
<P>
 Both factions in the fight for a separate nation have blamed each other for 
the infighting, but tensions were clearly aggravated by Talabani's recent 
absence abroad. Since his return by a Turkish helicopter Thursday, he has given 
his blessing to a peace process that has brought a cease-fire and troop 
withdrawals from front lines. But distrust remains. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's crazy. The two sides are only about as different as Coke and 
Pepsi-Cola," said a senior Western relief official, venting his anger at what 
he called a senseless internal power struggle that had set the Kurdish cause 
back at a time when Western donors are beginning to discuss next year's 
$288-million aid program for Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of that goes to the 3.5 million people of northern Iraq, and much of the 
money has come out of U.S. military coffers -- $65.6 million in the fiscal year 
1992, $61 million in 1993 and a planned $139 million in 1994, said Harry Houck, 
the local representative of the Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 But the fighting has also been of concern to the United States, which is 
worried that the squabbling might encourage Hussein to attack. American visits 
to the Kurdish heartlands have also been restricted since a tragic "friendly 
fire" incident over northern Iraq in April in which U.S. planes shot down two 
U.S. helicopters, killing all 26 allied officers on board. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, the Iraqi president has made no military moves and seems to have been 
ready to wait for the Kurds to collapse on their own, according to sources in 
the allied Operation Provide Comfort. The Turkish-based force brought the Iraqi 
Kurds home after they fled Hussein's vengeful armies to the mountains of Turkey 
and Iran after the Gulf War in 1991 and has protected them ever since. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday's peace talks between the Kurdish rivals have helped mend the damage 
done in the latest fighting, although the Kurdish area is now badly divided. 
Talabani's Patriotic Union of Kurdistan now controls most of the eastern region 
of Sulaymaniyah, while Barzani's Kurdistan Democratic Party controls the 
western region of Dahuk. Both contest parts of central Irbil and three areas 
close to the Iranian border, where pro-Iranian Islamists have been advancing 
and the cease-fire has yet to take hold. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the talks in central Irbil had tense moments. Just as Talabani's 
limousine crunched to a halt outside the Shireen Palace Hotel, a stray shot 
rang out. Heavily armed guerrillas leaped to battle stations. 
</P>
<P>
 Bloodshed was averted by the soldiers of the Iraqi National Congress, the 
umbrella organization of groups opposed to Hussein. The soldiers' commander, 
Capt. Mohammed, a Shiite Muslim from Baghdad, stood among the guerrillas in the 
middle of the square, waving his arms and shouting that nothing was wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kurds may have damaged their reputation with the recent fighting, but the 
Iraqi National Congress has won credit. The congress's leader, Ahmed Chalab, 
did the most to mediate peace between the Kurds. His 750-man force of Iraqi 
army defectors is now also successfully securing most of the roads between 
areas controlled by the rival Kurdish groups. Their flag of three interlocking 
circles, representing the Sunni, Shiite and Kurdish communities of Iraq, has 
become a common and respected sight. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd never seen it before, this fighting. We didn't know they had a 
disciplined army like this. We're proud of them," said Ismail Aziz, 31, a 
Kurdish movie theater employee watching the congress soldiers who handled the 
guerrillas milling outside the hotel.

RWANDAN GOVERNMENT SHELLING FORCES U.N. PLANE TO FLEE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Rwandan government troops slammed two mortar bombs into Kigali airport as a 
U.N. plane landed Sunday, forcing the aircraft to take off hastily with an 
Italian envoy on board. 
</P>
<P>
 Franco Rocchetta, an Italian Foreign Ministry official, had been scheduled to 
spend the day in Rwanda determining how best Italy could help the devastated 
country. He was to inspect the U.N. headquarters, a local hospital and a church 
compound where thousands of refugees are stranded. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses said one 81-millimeter mortar bomb exploded about 400 yards from the 
Canadian C-130 transporter as it was about to unload its passengers and relief 
supplies at the airport in the rebel-held east of the Rwandan capital. 
</P>
<P>
 The plane then scrambled into an emergency takeoff and lifted off seconds 
before a second bomb crashed into the tarmac, sending chunks of gravel whizzing 
past waiting journalists and U.N. officers. 
</P>
<P>
 Four more bombs hit the airport less than an hour after the U.N. plane took 
off and returned to the Kenyan capital of Nairobi where it had started its 
journey. 
</P>
<P>
 Government forces "know exactly when a plane is on the ground because they 
give us clearance the night before," said U.N. military spokesman Maj. Jean-Guy 
Plante. 
</P>
<P>
 There were no casualties in Sunday's incident. While the Hutu-dominated army 
was flexing its muscles around the airport, the mainly Tutsi Rwandan Patriotic 
Front rebels were battling closer to the government stronghold of Gitarama, 30 
miles west of the capital. 
</P>
<P>
 Gitarama and Kigali are the main targets of a rebel offensive that has taken 
control of about half the country in the last two months. Rebels hold parts of 
Kigali and are shelling government positions in the center of the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The rebels have seized the town of Kabgayi, three miles south of Gitarama, and 
are moving forward. But Plante said Gitarama is well fortified. 
</P>
<P>
 "Their normal procedure when they come to an area like that is to surround it, 
pound it and infiltrate it," said Maj. Gen. Romeo Dallaire, a Canadian who 
commands the 450 U.N. troops in Rwanda. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not sure how far they've got beyond Kabgayi. They are infiltrating 
Gitarama and going a little west of it." 
</P>
<P>
 The general said he also had word of a counteroffensive by Hutu-dominated 
government forces in the south of Rwanda, but he offered no details. 
</P>
<P>
 An estimated 200,000 to 500,000 people have died in Rwanda's civil war pitting 
government forces, mostly from the majority Hutu tribe, against the rebels, 
made up mainly of minority Tutsis and anti-government Hutus. Most of the 
victims have been civilians slaughtered by members of a government militia, 
sometimes with the aid of government troops.

ISRAEL AGREES TO DOUBLE PAY OF SOCIAL WORKERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From a Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With its whole system of social services on the point of collapse, the Israeli 
government agreed Sunday to raise the pay of its 9,500 striking social workers 
by an average of $550 a month, almost doubling the salaries of three-quarters 
of them. 
</P>
<P>
 Eli Ben-Gara, secretary general of the Israel Social Workers Union, said the 
46-day strike had wrought "a very significant revolution" in forcing the 
government to rethink its spending priorities and treat social workers once 
again as professionals. 
</P>
<P>
 The strike had closed shelters for battered wives, shut down drug 
rehabilitation programs, kept patients otherwise ready for release in mental 
hospitals and left runaway children in the streets. Abortions, adoptions and 
divorces, all of which must involve social workers here, were held up. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the social workers deserved (the raise) because they really work on 
the front lines of distress," said Shalom Granit, the government's chief wage 
negotiator. "The fear is always what will others say . . . because everyone has 
a reason on why they deserve a significant raise in pay." 
</P>
<P>
 Under the old salary scale, starting social workers were paid $625 a month, 
including a supplement to bring them above the legal minimum wage; a veteran 
with 17 years experience was paid $900 a month. 
</P>
<P>
 The social workers had originally demanded across-the-board raises of $965 a 
month, and the government offered 18% over four years.

 U.N. envoy Yasushi Akashi said he still plans to get Bosnia's warring factions 
together for cease-fire talks.His assurances came hours after his spokesman in 
Geneva said all such plans had been scrapped. "In this job, life is full of 
unforeseen developments," Akashi told reporters as he announced a later meeting 
with Bosnian Vice President Ejup Ganic. Akashi said Bosnian Serb leaders had 
agreed to move their forces from a ridge just inside the exclusion zone around 
Gorazde and let U.N. peacekeepers take over the position.

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / GOVERNOR; CANDIDATES LAUNCH FINAL BLITZ BEFORE TUESDAY'S

 The primary election campaign for governor comes to an end in traditional 
fashion today, as candidates tour California's major media and voter centers by 
plane, bus and radio-TV waves in final appeals for votes. 
</P>
<P>
 The secretary of state's office has estimated that 5.6 million Californians 
will turn out Tuesday to choose party nominees for all major state offices, the 
U.S. Senate and House, the Legislature, nine statewide ballot measures and a 
variety of county and local offices. Polls will be open from 7 a.m. until 8 
p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The spotlight has been on the contest for governor, as Republican Pete Wilson 
seeks renomination, and Treasurer Kathleen Brown, Insurance Commissioner John 
Garamendi and state Sen. Tom Hayden battle for the right to carry the 
Democratic banner into the fall campaign.

 Brown, the leader in the polls all year long, planned events in San Francisco 
and Los Angeles today that focus on her theme of creating 1 million new jobs 
over the next four years. Brown has been touring the state by bus in recent 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi visited a string of small and medium-size cities by plane Sunday and 
hits the big media and voter markets today, traveling from Sacramento to 
Oakland, Los Angeles and San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 Hayden planned stops in San Diego, San Jose, Santa Cruz and San Francisco, 
returning to Los Angeles late tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 On the Republican side, Wilson will wind up the campaign as he usually does, 
with a rally in his hometown of San Diego this evening. He also has scheduled 
an appearance on a Los Angeles morning television show today. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the weekend, upstart challenger Ron Unz continued to try to engage 
Wilson in a second radio debate. But the Wilson campaign said it was not about 
to give Unz the opportunity to raise any new issues or make any charges that 
might be difficult to refute on the eve of the election. 
</P>
<P>
 Unz also planned to hold news conferences in Sacramento and Burbank today. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson addressed veterans at a breakfast in Riverside on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Also Sunday, Brown made campaign bus stops in Downey, Lakewood, Loma Linda and 
Pomona and planned to be in San Francisco overnight. 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi hedgehopped in a twin-engine prop plane from Bakersfield to Fresno, 
Santa Barbara, Salinas and Chico. 
</P>
<P>
 Hayden spent much of Sunday making the rounds of radio talk shows and taping a 
television interview in Los Angeles.

SHOTS IN PASADENA HIT CAR WITH 3 CHILDREN INSIDE; CYCLIST HELD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Pasadena police arrested a bicyclist Sunday after he allegedly fired a 
semiautomatic pistol at a car containing three children shortly after midnight. 
</P>
<P>
 Bullets struck the car's windows, body and tires, but the three boys and a man 
inside escaped injury, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The shooting occurred at 12:23 a.m. near Penn Street and Los Robles Avenue in 
Pasadena as the two 12-year-olds and a 14-year-old were returning home from the 
movies with a 20-year-old Pacoima man, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 A man on a bicycle approached their Pontiac Firebird, began firing at it and 
rode away, Lt. Paul Gales said. Police officers who heard the shots pursued the 
man and arrested him on suspicion of attempted murder, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The suspect, Sheldon Dodd, 20, was being held without bail Sunday. Police 
would not identify the car's occupants, but said there is no evidence that they 
knew Dodd.

TIMES MIRROR SHOWS OLD RULES MAY NO LONGER APPLY; COMMUNICATIONS: IN MERGING 
ITS CABLE TV ASSETS WITH COX ENTERPRISES, THE MEDIA COMPANY IS REPOSITIONING 
ITSELF AS A 'CONTENT PROVIDER' FOR THE BURGEONING INFORMATION AGE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN LIPPMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 By merging its cable TV assets with Cox Enterprises, Times Mirror Co. is 
signaling that the old rules that shaped the diversified media conglomerates of 
the past 30 years may no longer apply in an era of rapid technological change 
in communications. 
</P>
<P>
 After decades of following a cautious path and staying close to its publishing 
roots, Times Mirror is dramatically repositioning itself as a "content 
provider" for the coming age in which information and entertainment will be 
received over everything from computers to interactive TV's. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fundamental decision is that we want to focus on the content side," said 
Robert F. Erburu, 63, chairman, president and chief executive of Times Mirror. 
"That's the strength we're best able to build upon in the future." 
</P>
<P>
 As Times Mirror executives envision it, becoming a content provider means 
everything from launching and investing in cable TV networks such as The 
Outdoor Channel to using the information gathered by its newspapers and 
magazines for new programming services and ideas. 
</P>
<P>
 The emphasis on content also means that Times Mirror does not have to worry 
about which "platform" -- cable TV, telephone lines, wireless personal 
communications services or satellites -- delivers the information into the home 
and can become a provider to all of them. 
</P>
<P>
 Times Mirror's decision to spin off its 1.2-million subscriber cable TV assets 
to Cox comes at a time when all major media companies are looking at what role 
they will play in the coming so-called information superhighway, where it's 
expected that consumers will be able to order movies-on-demand, play video 
games and shop electronically over their cable TV. 
</P>
<P>
 Media companies such as Times Mirror also face a thundering herd of 
competition, from local phone companies to giant entertainment conglomerates 
and computer firms, which all want to cash in on ways to deliver information to 
the consumer at home and work. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan, perhaps most significantly, indicates that Times Mirror is bearish 
about the company's long-term prospects as a cable TV operator, and would 
rather provide information that cable firms, telephone companies and other 
electronic distributors can sell to the public. 
</P>
<P>
 "It pretty clearly tells you that Times Mirror feels the future of the 
business is providing content into the business-oriented distribution market," 
said James D. Dougherty of Dean Witter Discover & Co. The company believes, he 
added, that "it's better for Times Mirror to be out of the (cable) business 
when they can get a good price for it, and when they feel the returns on cable 
are just going to shrink over a long period of time." 
</P>
<P>
 Erburu, however, said that making the capital investments to build the 
broad-band infrastructure would use up Times Mirror resources at a time when it 
wanted to invest the money elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Once a diversified media conglomerate, Times Mirror in recent years has 
refocused on its core business of big-city newspapers and professional-textbook 
publishing, as well as making some forays into new media technologies. 
</P>
<P>
 Such a strategy is unusual in the clubby world of media empires, where the 
conventional wisdom has been that stakes in as many areas as possible -- 
newspapers, broadcasting, cable TV, magazine and book publishing -- is the best 
way to hedge bets and ensure growth. 
</P>
<P>
 The shift in Times Mirror's strategy also has been accompanied by a move away 
from a family-run business to a multibillion-dollar corporation run by 
professional managers. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the founding Chandler family still controls more than 50% of Times 
Mirror's voting stock and has four seats on its 14-member board, the family has 
not been involved in the top management for a number of years. Otis Chandler 
retired as publisher of The Times in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
 Beginning in the 1960s, after it went public, Times Mirror aggressively 
expanded, buying TV stations, cable TV systems, major newspapers, magazines, 
and professional book publishing companies. The strategy paralleled that of 
other media firms. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, over a 30-year period Times Mirror spent $2.2 billion in cash and 
stock on acquisitions and another $3.4 billion in capital expenditures. 
</P>
<P>
 The acquisitions propelled Times Mirror into the leading ranks among media 
companies and earned it a spot as No. 135 on the Fortune 500 as recently as 
1991. But Times Mirror's diversification strategy included mixed results along 
the way. 
</P>
<P>
 The company eventually unloaded unprofitable newspapers in Dallas and Denver, 
taking a $65-million charge against earnings in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 A trade magazine bought in 1987 for $75 million was sold four years later for 
$32 million. And last year Times Mirror sold its four network affiliate TV 
stations for $320 million, only to have the buyer sell them six months later 
for a considerably higher price. 
</P>
<P>
 Not surprisingly, these results coupled with the economic downturn in the 
markets where Times Mirror owns newspapers -- advertising at The Times is off 
$150 million since 1991 -- have made the company's stock one of the lower 
performers among media companies over the last two years. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the stock market achieved record highs, Times Mirror's stock price 
has languished between $25 and $38 per share since 1990, far off its 1987 peak 
of $52. 
</P>
<P>
 The spotty record in diversifying -- a notable exception has been the 
specialty book and professional publishing division, which now accounts for 
one-third of Times Mirror's revenues and more than half its operating profits 
-- and sagging stock price has led to speculation that the Chandler family 
wanted to take cash out of the company. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the Chandler holdings in Times Mirror are locked up in trusts that 
cannot be disbursed until sometime toward the end of the first quarter of the 
next century. Tom Untermann, general counsel of Times Mirror, said that it is 
not anticipated that the preferred shares that the Chandlers Trusts receives as 
part of the deal will be sold. 
</P>
<P>
 Erburu said that, "The Chandler Trusts were solidly behind this arrangement, 
as are the outside directors. There's unanimity among the Chandler Trusts, the 
management, and independent directors." 
</P>
<P>

AGRIBUSINESS EXECUTIVE DONATES $1 MILLION TO NIXON THINK TANK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANNA CEKOLA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Agribusiness executive Dwayne O. Andreas, known for his major financial 
support of Republican and Democratic politicians through the decades, has made 
a $1 million gift to the Center for Peace and Freedom at the Richard Nixon 
Library & Birthplace, a significant boost for the fledgling think tank. 
</P>
<P>
 "During a remarkable two decades as an elder statesman -- through his 
writings, his fact-finding trips and his public statements -- President Nixon 
demonstrated a profound commitment to finding pragmatic solutions to 
international problems," Andreas, 76, chairman and chief executive officer of 
Archer Daniels Midland Co., said in a statement issued from his Decatur, Ill., 
headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 In announcing the gift, George L. Argyros, chairman of the library's 
$25-million Legacy of Peace fund-raising campaign, said: "As we redouble our 
commitment to sustaining the legacy and, now, the memory of President Nixon, we 
accept Dwayne Andreas' generous gift with enormous gratitude." 
</P>
<P>
 Born in 1918 in Worthington, Minn., Andreas joined Archer Daniels Midland in 
1966, taking the helm in 1970. Among many other associations, he has served on 
federal advisory bodies under Republican and Democratic Presidents. 
</P>
<P>
 He is perhaps best known outside agribusiness circles as having contributed 
hundreds of thousands of dollars to both major parties and their candidates, a 
role that has sometimes landed him in controversy. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1974, he was indicted but acquitted on charges of funneling illegal 
corporate contributions to his good friend, former Vice President and 
Democratic presidential candidate Hubert H. Humphrey. 
</P>
<P>
 A $25,000 campaign contribution in 1972 to Nixon fund-raiser Kenneth Dahlberg 
turned him into what he once described to the Washington Post as an "innocent 
bystander" in the Watergate scandal. That money ended up in the bank account of 
Watergate burglar Bernard Barker, giving investigators the first link between 
the Watergate break-in and the Nixon campaign committee. 
</P>
<P>
 His $1-million gift will provide support for the Center for Peace and Freedom, 
which officials say will add a voice to the debate over contemporary political 
issues and preserve Nixon's place in history as a key player in shaping world 
events. 
</P>
<P>
 The center, which will be headquartered at the Nixon library and have an 
office in Washington, began operations in March when Nixon spoke in the 
nation's capital before 45 foreign policy officials, analysts and commentators.

COMMUNITIES SEEK WAYS TO SAVE DYING DOWNTOWNS; RECOVERY: EVEN BEFORE THE QUAKE, 
COMMERCIAL STRIPS OF CANOGA PARK AND RESEDA WERE IN TROUBLE. MERCHANTS AND 
RESIDENTS MEET TO DISCUSS REVITALIZATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 No one was under any illusions. 
</P>
<P>
 They gathered with high hopes and big plans in Winnetka over the weekend, but 
few of the 100 or so people sorting out the future of Canoga Park and Reseda 
really believed their down-and-out downtowns would ever be anything more than 
downright dowdy. 
</P>
<P>
 Even that, though, would be an improvement over the trash-strewn parking lots, 
the boarded-up shop windows and the desolate sidewalks that now line Sherman 
Way through both communities. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not creating another 3rd Street Promenade," Los Angeles City 
Councilwoman Laura Chick cautioned, opening a two-day workshop intended to help 
turn around the failing commercial areas in her west San Fernando Valley 
district. "We are not going to paint castles in the sky. This is the first 
step." 
</P>
<P>
 Once two of the Valley's small-town jewels, the downtown strips of Canoga Park 
and Reseda have spent most of the last two decades in a tailspin -- their 
business sucked away by the malls and the changing public tastes. After the 
Northridge earthquake knocked out dozens of shops, the neighborhoods have 
declined even further. 
</P>
<P>
 So frustrated residents and merchants of both communities spent the weekend 
meeting with architects, urban planners, landscapers and finance experts to 
figure out small and simple ways to give their downtowns a boost. 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing fancy. Just a few things here and there to make the neighborhoods look 
a little less scummy, a little more friendly. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want it to go back to the way it used to be," said Nancy LaSota, president 
of the Canoga Park Chamber of Commerce, who like most of those who attended the 
workshop believed the people who live and work in the neighborhood know better 
than downtown bureaucrats what their area needs. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the ideas were as simple as encouraging merchants along Sherman Way 
and Reseda Boulevard to open their front doors. As it is, many shopkeepers 
leave the front of their stores -- the side that faces the sidewalk and the 
street -- closed because most customers drive directly to the parking area 
behind the buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 The result is a street that looks deserted even as a bustling trade goes on 
behind locked front doors. Supporters of the idea figure that opening up the 
fronts of the stores will create a sense of activity and encourage shoppers to 
wander from store to store. 
</P>
<P>
 To that end, some called for planting trees along the sidewalks and in the 
street medians to give some shade and create an identifiable area. Some also 
wanted minor facade improvements -- some as simple as a paint job or taking 
down a gaudy sign. 
</P>
<P>
 Keeping trash piles out of the parking lots could be solved by locking the 
lots at night or by controlling access with a guard gate. But solutions like 
that cost money, and few merchants are willing to foot the bill. 
</P>
<P>
 So participants suggested local community leaders look to governmental sources 
such as the Community Redevelopment Agency to put some fast cash into the 
neighborhood. Some suggested the federal government might help out. Or cultural 
and historical associations might be willing to put some money toward 
refurbishing older buildings, they noted. 
</P>
<P>
 But everyone acknowledged that all the money and all the pretty sidewalks in 
the world won't turn an area around unless shoppers are drawn to it. Yet 
neither neighborhood currently offers much to lure outsiders. 
</P>
<P>
 So participants called for creating specialized shopping districts that would 
capitalize on one or two types of stores, such as the antique shops that line 
Sherman Way in Canoga Park. Someone suggested retail outlet stores for the 
larger storefronts in Reseda. 
</P>
<P>
 But ideas are easy. Seeing them through is tougher. 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds of thousands of dollars have been spent in the past to draw up 
visions of tree-lined streets brimming with espresso bars and trendy boutiques. 
More often than not, though, the plans collect dust on a shelf as the 
neighborhoods fill up with pawn shops instead of coffee shops, and weeds sprout 
instead of jacarandas. 
</P>
<P>
 Gwendolyn Pentecost, a consultant who helped spruce up downtown Burbank and 
Santa Monica's 3rd Street Promenade, said the potential for failure in Canoga 
Park and Reseda is great unless property owners, merchants and community 
leaders cooperate to execute the plans. 
</P>
<P>
 "When all the experts go away you have to be able to do it by yourself," 
Pentecost said. "All the plans in the world do no good if you walk away and 
there is no one to put them in place." 
</P>
<P>
 Historically, there has been little cooperation in Reseda. Many of the 
tumble-down buildings are owned by absentee landlords who care little about 
upkeep. An oft-repeated story relates the remarks of a landlord who was not 
interested in sprucing up his building because he said he made more money, in 
tax write-offs, if he lost money. 
</P>
<P>
 "The level of apathy is beyond description," said Los Angeles Police Officer 
Stephanie Tisdale, who patrols Reseda as a senior lead officer. 
</P>
<P>
 Getting merchants together is complicated by the fact that in Reseda alone 
there are 27 ethnic groups speaking 67 dialects. But almost everyone at the 
weekend workshops was white. 
</P>
<P>
 Even among those who agree the neighborhoods need attention, there is 
disagreement over how best to proceed. For instance, as Tisdale led a group 
through Reseda, she stopped at a sidewalk bench erected in some past effort to 
put a shine on the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 "From a police standpoint, we'd like these not to be here," Tisdale said. "Who 
do you think sleeps here at night and hangs out here all day?" 
</P>
<P>
 Planner Jane Blumenfeld responded: "There are ways to do this right." 
</P>
<P>
 "OK, great," Tisdale said, shrugging her shoulders in disbelief. 
</P>
<P>
 But in dozens of exchanges like the one between Blumenfeld and Tisdale there 
emerged a sense that maybe this time things will be different, that maybe this 
time some of the ideas will work and that maybe this will be the first time in 
a long time that the neighborhoods change for the better. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Brain, a Sherman Oaks real estate broker who is trying to remedy less 
severe problems on Ventura Boulevard, was heartened by the cooperation he saw. 
It's unlikely this will turn central Canoga Park into a hip spot like Old Town 
Pasadena, but it was, as Chick said, a first step. 
</P>
<P>
 "Small steps lead to big steps," Brain said.

POMP AND AFTERSHOCKS; AFTER A SHAKY FINAL SEMESTER, CSUN GRADUATES READY TO 
MOVE ON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM ENRIQUEZ and JOHN CHANDLER, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 To the strains of "Pomp and Circumstance," armies of anxious college seniors 
across the country will march this spring from the security of campus life into 
the shaky and unpredictable outside world -- except at Cal State Northridge, 
where it's the reverse. 
</P>
<P>
 At the San Fernando Valley school, graduates began preparing Sunday to leave 
behind an institution literally shaken to its foundations, heading for more 
solid footing on the outside. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll never forget the last semester at Northridge," said Maricar Lagman, 24, 
who was honored as the school's outstanding engineering student during 
ceremonies recognizing about 1,000 of CSUN's top graduates. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a sentiment no doubt common among the 6,700 CSUN students who will 
receive diplomas in ceremonies beginning today. 
</P>
<P>
 Lagman and her roommates started the semester sleeping huddled on the living 
room floor of their Northridge townhouse, afraid to sleep in their own rooms 
because of aftershocks from the Jan. 17 earthquake that caused an estimated 
$325 million in damage to the CSUN campus. She recalled being jolted out of bed 
by the quake, groping her way outside without shoes or glasses, and injuring 
her ankle and hand when she tripped over a moped in the darkness. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was scared for my life. I just wanted to get out, out of California," said 
Lagman, who now hopes to find work as a computer software engineer, but has 
resigned herself to a continued life in the seismic zone. 
</P>
<P>
 She and thousands of others, however, decided to stick it out -- despite 
broken buildings, including the library, broken laboratories, temporary toilets 
and classes in trailers. 
</P>
<P>
 At the beginning of the semester, classrooms were mismarked, keys didn't work 
and professors had no access to lecture notes locked away in buildings closed 
by safety inspectors. Not even the drinking fountains worked. 
</P>
<P>
 "All the students have been through a lot," said Lagman. "I think we've 
learned a lot, and I've grown a lot." 
</P>
<P>
 Lagman and other grads have discovered early one of the most important and 
lasting lessons of college life: endurance. That and the need to cooperate, "to 
find the common ground of humanity," said keynote speaker Andrew Young. 
</P>
<P>
 Young -- the civil rights leader, former mayor of Atlanta and former U. N. 
ambassador -- said he learned the first lesson in 1963, when he and a group of 
young protesters were locked in a van by Georgia police. 
</P>
<P>
 "The 110-degree heat was designed to make us lose our cool and give up our 
struggle," said Young, vice chairman of an engineering firm that has been hired 
to assess damage at the CSUN campus. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of panicking, he said, the group visualized a day at the beach, 
imagining the feel of cold water, the lap of the waves "until the police gave 
up and let us out." 
</P>
<P>
 The 25,000 or so students at the campus faced their own tests of will after 
the Northridge quake damaged most of the university's largest buildings just 
before the start of the spring semester. 
</P>
<P>
 In a round-the-clock effort, portable classrooms, trailers and toilets were 
rented and set up between damaged buildings to keep the school open. But the 
arrangement, praised as heroic, brought with it a host of problems for students 
and faculty alike. 
</P>
<P>
 "My music classes ended up all over the place, and I was running back and 
forth across the campus," said Audra Camacho, 18, a freshman clarinet player in 
the CSUN wind ensemble that played music for the honors student ceremony. "The 
teachers thought they'd take it easy at first, and we talked a lot about the 
earthquake and stuff, but then we had to make up all the material later, for 
finals." 
</P>
<P>
 Camacho said she plans to return for her sophomore year in the fall, even 
though it will be from three to five years before CSUN is completely rebuilt. 
</P>
<P>
 Although federal money is expected to eventually pay for most repairs to the 
school, some students are apparently reluctant to spend their college years at 
a campus under construction. Applications to transfer into CSUN for the fall 
semester are down slightly from previous years. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, campus officials are stepping up efforts to contact local high 
schools and community colleges to assure students that they can enroll at CSUN, 
despite its troubles. 
</P>
<P>
 CSUN President Blenda J. Wilson said she was pleased that despite the 
earthquake "students did not desert us." The earthquake, she said, "gave us a 
profound sense of our potential, united us around our dedication to education." 
</P>
<P>
 Aides say the earthquake also in some ways made it easier for Wilson -- who 
took over the top job 20 months ago -- to push through management changes at 
the school, which has been criticized in the past for its low graduation rate. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the top administrators under the previous CSUN president, James 
Cleary, are either gone or working in different jobs. Campus officials said 
Sunday that Elliot Mininberg, vice president for administration and finance, is 
resigning his post after 10 years to become a professor in the School of 
Education. 
</P>
<P>
 But campus politics, or even an earthquake for that matter, had little effect 
on graduate Anne Marenco, a 35-year-old Santa Clarita resident and mother of 
two who is getting a bachelor's degree in family environmental sciences, 
formerly home economics. 
</P>
<P>
 For 18 years, Marenco has plugged along toward a degree, taking classes part 
time at Pierce College before arriving at CSUN in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
 Marenco said she plowed through the spring semester undaunted by the 
destruction at her campus. In fact, Marenco, like others, said classes were 
easier because many instructors lightened up on their usual assignments.

 'I'm generally a very flexible person, and didn't feel put out about having 
classes in a trailer or having to go to the bathroom in a trailer," said 
Marenco, who plans to spend the next two years at CSUN working on a master's 
degree.

 "I would have hated to have the university say, 'OK, we're closed.' I think

"We all worked very hard this semester to make it bearable and livable."

TASTE OF TARZANA; BENEFIT SERVES UP A WORLD OF FOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 While many around the Valley may have stuck with a traditional Sunday dinner 
of pot roast and potatoes this weekend, in Tarzana they ate like globe trotters 
-- and fairly cheaply at that. 
</P>
<P>
 Cajun pepper shark for $2.Icy margaritas for $3. And rigatoni tre colore for 
$2. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Tarzana's time to show off its culinary diversity, and thousands 
gathered Sunday for a bite at the Taste of Tarzana. 
</P>
<P>
 Folks picked up a handful of tickets for $1 apiece and ate their way from New 
York to New Delhi without leaving Tarzana Square. 
</P>
<P>
 "The purpose and aim is to benefit local restaurants and vendors, and to bring 
business to Tarzana and adjoining cities," said Tarzana Chamber of Commerce 
spokesman Pat Zicarelli. "We had to turn away vendors because we had so many 
requests." 
</P>
<P>
 About 25 local restaurants were on hand to show off their edible wares, and 
profits from the event were to go to local schools and libraries. 
</P>
<P>
 Ellen Siegler, the chamber's executive director, expected this giant picnic -- 
which ran from 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. -- to be even more popular than a similar 
gathering last October, which drew 10,000 people. And by 1:30 p.m., 6,700 had 
already come through the gates. 
</P>
<P>
 While chomping on the barbecued ribs and shishkebabs that seemed especially 
popular, diners were entertained by clowns, square dancers from the Trail 
Dusters club, and country tunes courtesy of Sharonmarie Fisher's Women in 
Country.

DEVELOPER SHOPPING FOR NEW STORES FOR MALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUGLAS ALGER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Shoppers might want to begin making room on their credit cards now. 
</P>
<P>
 The Newhall Land and Farming Co. is shopping around for department stores, the 
first step toward doubling the size of its 21-month-old Valencia Town Center. 
</P>
<P>
 The regional shopping mall, now featuring 110 stores and 750,000 square feet 
of retail space, is expected to grow to about 200 stores and 1.4 million square 
feet within two or three years. 
</P>
<P>
 To expand the mall, the developer must first reach agreements with large 
stores -- such as the existing J. C. Penney, Robinsons-May and Sears -- that 
will anchor additional corridors of stores for the center. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really dependent upon a firm commitment from the department stores," 
said Marlee Lauffer, spokeswoman for Newhall Land. 
</P>
<P>
 Preliminary talks are ongoing with about a dozen candidates, including 
Nordstrom -- in which residents declared their interest four years ago in a 
community survey -- and Gottschalk Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 "We definitely want to have some upscale stores like Nordstrom," Lauffer said. 
"We need to have more of what they call 'fashion-forward' stores. We want to 
make sure we have the full range of the shopping experience." 
</P>
<P>
 Figuring into discussions are the changes many department store chains are 
undergoing. 
</P>
<P>
 May Co., which had established an outlet in the Valencia Town Center, merged 
with Robinsons soon after the shopping center opened in September, 1992. 
Bullock's has closed stores in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, the New York-based Bloomingdale's announced plans to open four 
stores in Los Angeles and Orange counties, a decision Southern California 
leaders fervently hope signifies an economic turnaround for the area. 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Levy, chief executive officer for Gottschalk, said the company is in the 
"sort of kicking the tires" stage of discussions with Newhall Land, but no 
agreement has been reached. 
</P>
<P>
 "Certainly (Santa Clarita) has the demographics we like," Levy said. "It does 
not have, in my mind, much department store competition, not unlike Palmdale, 
where we are doing very well. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of these days we'd sure like to be there," Levy added. 
</P>
<P>
 But if Newhall's talk of expansion sounds strange in uncertain economic times, 
it just continues a trend. 
</P>
<P>
 The Valencia Town Center was one of only two malls to open in California in 
1992 and was built during a 70% drop in shopping center construction 
nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 While 1,510 new shopping centers opened across the country in 1989, only 552 
opened in 1991, according to the International Council of Shopping Centers. The 
Valencia outlet was one of only 460, from strip malls to regional "power 
centers," that opened nationwide in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The council attributed the drop to a scarcity of construction loans following 
problems in the savings and loan industry, making funds available only for 
projects considered a sure thing. 
</P>
<P>
 The Valencia Town Center has so far generated $1 million per year in sales tax 
revenue, as predicted. 
</P>
<P>
 Most recently, it is thought to have benefited from the Jan. 17 earthquake 
that damaged and shut down the Northridge Fashion Center. Although difficult to 
document, the Northridge center's closure is believed to have meant more 
shoppers for the Santa Clarita mall. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anecdotally, from what the merchants say, there seem to be more people 
shopping from the San Fernando Valley," Lauffer said.

A BEAR'S BEST FRIEND; TIMOTHY TREADWELL SAYS A GRIZZLY SAVED HIS LIFE -- SO HE 
IS TRYING TO RETURN THE FAVOR. ARMED WITH PHOTOS AND LECTURES, HE HAS DEDICATED 
HIMSELF TO THEIR PRESERVATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE SCHWARTZ, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Timothy Treadwell had a hangover. Again. So, as he'd done countless times 
before, he drove to an isolated spot in the wilderness -- this time 
Wrangell-St. Elias National Preserve in Alaska -- and hiked into the woods to 
dry out. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nothing could ever get me to stop drinking," he says now, seven years later, 
while downing his second Coca-Cola in as many minutes. "Some people find 
religion, some have a child and find a greater purpose in their lives." 
</P>
<P>
 But Treadwell felt doomed to live a short life of drinking, dodging barroom 
brawls and drying out from time to time in the woods. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, while trudging alone through the wild beauty of the preserve, something 
unexpected happened. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of a sudden a big, gorgeous bear, four or five hundred pounds, came 
crashing through the woods." 
</P>
<P>
 It froze at the sight of Treadwell and then, before he had the chance to back 
away, bounded majestically back into the woods. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a fleeting moment that was just magic," he says, his expression 
turning dreamy. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, Treadwell, 32, has become an expert on the world's largest 
terrestrial carnivore, the Alaskan grizzly, which can weigh 1,500 pounds and 
kill a person with a single swipe of its massive paw. 
</P>
<P>
 Each year, just as the bears emerge from their dens, scruffy, hungry and a 
little grumpy after a long winter of isolation, Treadwell flies to a remote 
region of Alaska, sets up a tent, pulls out his camera and hunkers down for 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "I get on their level. You have to get as wild as them as quickly as possible. 
I chomp on the grass here and there and hope I'm accepted." 
</P>
<P>
 When he's not out pawing the earth and snapping photographs, Treadwell spends 
his winters in Malibu where, between waiting tables, he tirelessly promotes the 
preservation of the grizzlies by showing his slides to schoolchildren and 
adults. In April, he signed a deal with Audubon Productions and Turner 
Broadcasting to be featured in a film called "The Man Who Loves Bears," slated 
to begin production this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bears saved my life," he says, adding without irony: "I'd be willing to 
die for them." 
</P>
<P>
 His one-room Malibu apartment is covered from wall to wall with close-range 
photographs of the bears -- candid pictures that reflect Treadwell's intimacy 
with his subjects. Like a proud parent, he points them out one by one. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's Booble. There's Snowy. Over there, that's Aqua Bear." His sentences 
run into each other like a train wreck as he bounds happily through the room. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Environmental brochures and newspaper articles on bear poaching take up the 
space not used by his photographs. Once in awhile a horse from a nearby barn 
pops its head into the bathroom window and, without breaking stride, Treadwell 
feeds it an apple. Except for a few modern amenities -- MTV, a small 
refrigerator, an answering machine -- the place has the dank, cavernous feel of 
a bear's lair. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a spirituality to this. I don't deny a God, but I don't see the 
standard God, the Christian God and all the Allahs. . . . When you are with a 
grizzly bear, up close, and you hear them breathe and you feel them move and 
you hear the gurgles in their stomach, you feel as if you are in the presence 
of a God and you must turn your life over." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, when it comes to grizzlies, Treadwell speaks with a fiery evangelism 
no matter who is listening. This fervor goes over particularly well with the 
second-graders at John L. Webster Elementary School in Malibu. 
</P>
<P>
 While they watch his slides, Treadwell tells his rapt audience that once, a 
long time ago, Malibu was filled with grizzlies.  
</P>
<P>
 Despite some giggles and the animated "oohs" and "ahs" as the kids pass around 
some bear fur, Treadwell hammers home the notion that bears are our friends, to 
be respected and revered. 
</P>
<P>
 "We never feed wild animals. No tricks or treats. Just try to be friendly. We 
don't want to take away their natural habits." 
</P>
<P>
 When one small girl with big O's for eyes asks Treadwell what he does if a 
bear gets mad at him, he happily replies: "I sing to it." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, singing is the only weapon Treadwell uses to placate a bear that 
exhibits any of the 21 basic warning signs of anger -- signs Treadwell has 
carefully memorized. In one close call, Treadwell tells the class, a young male 
approached him with his fur raised up in angry points on his back, snarling. 
But Treadwell managed to pacify the animal by singing a rhyme he made up on the 
spot. 
</P>
<P>
 Remarkably, during this encounter, Treadwell maintained a steady enough hand 
to snap his camera. The result is a series of amazing pictures showing how the 
angry adversary was lullabied into passivity. In the final slide, the bear 
sleeps peacefully only a few feet away. And Treadwell tells the class that he 
felt so secure he laid down beside the bear to catch of few Zs of his own. 
</P>
<P>
 "Timothy is quite off the wall," says Doug Peacock, a founding member of Earth 
First! "He's an iconoclast and an outsider. His empirical observations are as 
good as anyone's." 
</P>
<P>
 Sterling Miller, a bear biologist for the Alaska Department of Fish and Game, 
agrees that "Timothy's talks are very valuable. He's an advocate for the bear. 
A vocal and I think very effective one." 
</P>
<P>
 Treadwell plans to seek nonprofit status for his organization, the Great Bear 
Project. His goal, as the sole activist and head honcho of the project, is 
threefold: to protect their habitat, to end illegal poaching and to stop the 
practice of legal grizzly bear hunting. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to raise the grizzly bear to the kindred state of the whale and 
dolphin," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Treadwell's focus is on developing a peaceful strategy, he sees 
legitimacy in radical environmental groups such as Earth First! that have been 
criticized for resorting to violence. 
</P>
<P>
 But, he adds, "I think it's better working within the system. What's needed is 
education because to get results or legitimacy, you have to do it without 
shooting people." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, Treadwell is often accused of being overly emotional, especially 
when it comes to the issue of legal sport hunting. 
</P>
<P>
 "Grizzly populations have been reduced primarily through destruction of 
habitat," says Miller, the Alaska bear biologist. "Bears are his personal 
friends. Timothy is picking on an emotional issue and not on other targets that 
affect bear populations." 
</P>
<P>
 Treadwell concedes that he is emotional and that Miller, to whom he defers in 
all matters involving the science of bears, is right that "habitat encroachment 
is the main killer of bears." 
</P>
<P>
 Others express concern that Treadwell swaggers dangerously close to 
understating how unpredictable grizzlies can be. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything I've heard about him sounds terrific," says David Gaillard, 
project coordinator for Wild Forever -- the American Grizzly Bear Project, 
which -- in collaboration with the Sierra Club, the Audubon Society and the 
Greater Yellowstone Coalition -- seeks to protect the grizzly from extinction. 
"But he needs to be careful about sending a message to the public that bears 
don't pose a serious threat to human safety. Bears are not cuddly." 
</P>
<P>
 Treadwell doesn't believe he is giving the wrong message at all. He points out 
that the safest bear is the habituated bear, the one familiar with humans. He 
sees himself as a myth-breaker and wants to do away with the notion that bears 
are evil, terrifying creatures. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bears shouldn't be able to walk up 5th and Flower, but if people would stop 
hurting them, they would relax more around us. To coexist peacefully with the 
bear, you need compassion, reason, love, nurturing, a strong feminine side. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only thing you get back is what you give. Which is the essence of life. 
When I'm with Casper or Booble, they are cuddly." 
</P>
<P>
 And if he's attacked? 
</P>
<P>
 "You make your bed, you lie in it," he says without much flourish. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Peacock, of Earth First!, says he shares Treadwell's passion for the bear, but 
he is nonetheless quick to point out that he doesn't recommend Treadwell's 
methods. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bears of the world don't need thousands of Timothy Treadwells out there 
because sooner or later someone's gonna get mauled and that could cause a bear 
to get shot." 
</P>
<P>
 Just last month, a black bear was shot to death in Azusa after wandering out 
of the mountains and into a residential area.  
</P>
<P>
 Treadwell, who was filming in Alaska at the time, expressed sorrow for the 
bear's death. Although he makes no bones about shooting a bear when it clearly 
threatens life or property, he expressed concern for what he perceived in Azusa 
as the possible mishandling of the situation. He sees only one positive aspect: 
"Maybe they learned something from it, and next time they won't have to destroy 
a life."  
</P>
<P>
 Last August, a 13-year-old was mauled by a black bear at a campground in the 
San Bernardino National Forest. Although the boy survived, he required more 
than 100 stitches. After another attack the next day, two bears were tracked 
and shot to death -- standard procedure. 
</P>
<P>
 Treadwell is so fearful of this that he claims to have made a deal with his 
pilot to quietly dump his body in the ocean should he ever be found mauled to 
death in his secret refuge. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that he expects to meet such a fate. "They love me too much," he says of 
the bears. 
</P>
<P>
 So his agenda, for now at any rate, is to stay alive long enough to complete 
work on his film. Due to air early in 1995 on Turner Broadcasting, the film 
will follow Treadwell on his Alaskan adventures, focusing on the lucrative 
poaching trade with its ties to China. 
</P>
<P>
 Liam O'Brien, the independent producer who brought Treadwell to the attention 
of Audubon, says that while he's very excited about the film, he's also a 
little nervous about getting so close to the bears. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Brien's first impression of Treadwell was a common one: "I thought he was 
crazy," he says with a respectful laugh. But his interest was piqued and he 
soon realized that both Treadwell and his crusade were serious. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bears are being poached for their gall bladders and claws. A live bear is 
worth nothing. But a dead bear is worth up to $40,000. It's a Mercedes that 
they're shooting." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 With the film in pre-production, Treadwell's life has altered considerably. 
For one thing, he gets to quit waiting tables. But he also has to deal with the 
human world of collaboration, budgets and deal-making -- a world so alien to 
the solitude of his Alaskan refuge that when he talks about it, he appears 
baffled, even dismayed. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's therapeutic that other people are finding value in my work. People are 
giving me attention, and that's kind of nice but that's all about ego," he 
carefully explains. To him, the only important issue is whether this unfamiliar 
dip into the waters of Hollywood will help his bears. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't choose this calling," he says. "But in the course of saving animals, 
you save humans. You stop being afraid of the dark. You live in mutual respect 
and love." 
</P>
<P>
 He pauses to look at a picture of Booble digging for clams. 
</P>
<P>
 "And that," he says with a satisfied smile, "is the crux of it."

UFOS? RAINING FISH? IF IT'S STRANGE, IT'S IN THE FORTEAN TIMES, A SIGNPOST THAT 
SAYS . . ; WELCOME TO PLANET WEIRD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF KAYE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Good news for those who feel the world isn't weird enough for them. It's 
getting weirder. So say the experts at the Fortean Times, the magazine of 
strange phenomena, which has published a world strangeness index. Life on Earth 
was 3.5% weirder in 1993 than in 1992, according to their calculations. 
</P>
<P>
 Among thousands of bizarre events reported in 1993: 
</P>
<P>
 * Sixty lambs were found dead in a field in Germany after they were attacked 
by hundreds of crows. 
</P>
<P>
 * A policeman was rained on by two-inch-long fish in a remote area of 
northwest Australia. 
</P>
<P>
 * The apparition of an orange-red man-shaped object "filled the sky" over 
Shanghai for 20 minutes, then emitted red flashes, became mushroom-shaped and 
shrank from view. 
</P>
<P>
 Apparitions, bizarre deaths, mass hysteria, spontaneous human combustion -- 
this is the world of the London-based Fortean Times. Although for its first 20 
years it was available in the United States only by mail, it is now going on 
sale at some bookstores and newsstands. 
</P>
<P>
 To compute their Strangeness Index, the editors divided the world of weird 
phenomena into 34 categories and assigned points based on the increase or 
decrease of reported instances. 
</P>
<P>
 This totally unscientific -- but exceedingly compelling -- survey determined 
that reports of weird weather, strange deaths, animal swarmings and human 
ineptitude were up. Down were UFOs, crop circles and spontaneous human 
combustions. Poltergeists, water monsters and mass animal deaths remained 
static. 
</P>
<P>
 "We couldn't tell whether there was actually an increase in phenomena or an 
increase in reportings," co-editor Bob Rickard says. But he likes to think the 
list "could be useful in some sort of way." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the magazine is primarily for entertainment, the editors believe it 
serves an important function by pointing out that the world is full of 
inexplicable events. 
</P>
<P>
 "The more we learn about the world, the more mysterious phenomena there are to 
be found," Rickard says. "At one point it was thought science would explain the 
world and everything would be understood. I think it's part and parcel of 
modern cynicism now that nobody believes that." 
</P>
<P>
 Named after Charles Fort, a New York philosopher who published four volumes of 
strange phenomena between 1919 and 1932, the bimonthly magazine has a 
circulation of 17,000 and growing. 
</P>
<P>
 The current issue contains pages and pages of odd occurrences, such as the 
case of the Englishwoman whose dog always barks just before her phone rings and 
the Iranian man who bought a carp from a fish shop, placed it in his freezer 
for a week and then watched it jump back to life when he poured hot water on 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 Could this stuff be true? 
</P>
<P>
 A phone company technician discovered that the English dog was chained to a 
telephone ground post and was receiving a 90-volt shock with each incoming 
call. 
</P>
<P>
 No word yet on the fish, though. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Rickard and co-editor Paul Sieveking relish their role as purveyors of the odd 
and inexplicable. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're kind of guerrilla scientists," Rickard says. "We're interested in those 
rugs we can pull out from under some people's feet." 
</P>
<P>
 What amazes him is not unexplained phenomena, but the established scientific 
community's apparent lack of interest in seeking explanations for them. 
</P>
<P>
 "Science reacts like an organism," he says. "It closes ranks; it sends its 
antibodies, its assassins. The first confrontation with a new fact or a new 
theory is seen as a threat to the status quo." 
</P>
<P>
 That must be the reason we still don't understand why it rains fish or frogs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've actually interviewed people who put up their umbrellas and had them 
bouncing off," Rickard says. "There's no doubt they're falling from somewhere. 
You get falls of thousands of fish in a contained space." 
</P>
<P>
 John Maddox, editor of the British science journal Nature, is not familiar 
with the phenomenon of raining frogs. But he believes it could be possible for 
a strong enough wind, like a tornado, to lift a body of water and deposit it 
elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 On the question of whether scientists are ignoring strange phenomena, however, 
Maddox says, "the scientific community has its hands full with things that will 
provide tangible benefits" and that "it would be silly" to spend time 
investigating matters that were not well-grounded in observation or hypothesis. 
 
</P>
<P>
 Rickard, who studied product design, has no formal scientific training, while 
Sieveking studied archeology and anthropology but never worked in either field. 
 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Among the odd phenomena the scientific Establishment apparently has left for 
amateurs to investigate is the grisly world of Spontaneous Human Combustion 
(SHC). 
</P>
<P>
 "It's almost like a demonic visitation in that somebody, for no apparent 
reason, can suddenly burst into flames and in seconds be reduced to a pile of 
greasy ashes," Rickard says matter-of-factly. 
</P>
<P>
 In its current issue, the Fortean Times examines the case of a Welshman whose 
fiery death in 1980 carried all the hallmarks of SHC. As in other cases, his 
body was reduced to ashes, but virtually nothing else was burned. 
</P>
<P>
 Police Officer John Heymer, who investigated the case, told the magazine he 
was shocked when the inquest into the death gave no mention of its unusual 
aspects. 
</P>
<P>
 Forensic scientists from a government laboratory studied the incident and 
declared it completely explicable. But their explanation, the officer says, 
meant the victim would have had to fall headfirst into his fireplace and then 
sit back calmly in his easy chair while flames burned down from his head to his 
knees -- without anything else catching fire. 
</P>
<P>
 "You'd think the medical profession would be rushing to study it," Rickard 
says.  
</P>
<P>
 It's not easy keeping up with such a strange planet. Rickard does it from an 
office in his house, where he is surrounded by shelves and tables overflowing 
with books, periodicals, newspaper clippings and documents precariously like an 
avalanche waiting to happen. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have recorded the deaths of a few people crushed under mountains of books 
falling on them," he says, acknowledging his teetering data base.  
</P>
<P>
 To assemble each issue of the Fortean Times, Rickard and Sieveking rely on 
correspondence from readers around the world. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles would seem to be one of the strangest places on Earth, based on 
the number of bizarre reports emanating from there, Rickard says. But he's not 
sure if it's "really weird because of some intrinsic nature or whether it's 
because of media reporting." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the Fortean editors are gathering material on the Riverside woman whose 
body was said to have emitted fumes that sickened emergency room staffers.  
</P>
<P>
 As for Fortean's readers, they are overwhelmingly men between the ages of 20 
and 44, and just more than half say they have experienced something 
inexplicable, according to a readership survey. Only 6.1% think that most of 
the subject matter is nonsense. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of it probably is nonsense, Rickard freely admits. Still, he says, there 
is much to learn about why myths develop and propagate. "I don't think the 
general public is more rational than they were in the Middle Ages," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Rickard says he would never create or knowingly perpetuate a hoax. But beyond 
that, he'd like his readers to make up their own minds about what he publishes. 
</P>
<P>
 "We like to see ourselves, in a way, like wine experts. We taste the stuff, we 
sort of swill it around our minds and then sort of spit it out. We don't 
swallow everything."

COMMITMENTS; THE NEW PROTOCOL; GAY COUPLES WHO WANT TO GET MARRIED FACE THE 
SAME DILEMMAS THAT CONFRONT ANYONE WHOPLANS A WEDDING. AND THEN SOME. 
</P>

 George Ziemer and David Bruner of Burbank weren't sure what the reaction would 
be when they tried to register at a Southern California department store. "The 
woman was polite but clearly uncomfortable," Ziemer said. 
</P>
<P>
 "But then she told us we weren't the first same-sex couple to register there," 
Bruner added. "The biggest problem turned out to be that the computer program 
was set up so one of us had to be the bride and the other the groom." 
</P>
<P>
 When Tom Stoddard and his future spouse, Walter Rieman, went to a conservative 
Manhattan retailer to pick out their wedding rings, they expected to be turned 
away by the salesman. Stoddard, a longtime gay activist, said he was prepared 
to cause a scene. "But the salesman didn't blink," he said. "He acted like an 
appropriate and friendly businessperson." 
</P>
<P>
 Although same-sex weddings are becoming increasingly common, and Hawaii might 
soon become the first state to recognize them, the etiquette of such unions is 
still relatively uncharted territory -- and involves more than retailer 
reaction. 
</P>
<P>
 Same-sex couples who decide to tie the knot face many of the same dilemmas 
experienced by anyone who has planned a wedding, everything from prenuptial 
jitters to fights over how much it's all going to cost. And some different 
ones. 
</P>
<P>
 It starts with what to call the event. Gays have had to adapt and reinvent 
some of the more important aspects of the rites. Wedding applies, but the word 
"makes some people nervous," said Tess Ayers, co-author (with Paul Brown) of 
"The Essential Guide to Gay and Lesbian Weddings" (Harper San Francisco, 1994). 
</P>
<P>
 Because they were committed to the spiritual aspects of the ceremony, and had 
a minister and rabbi present, Sandy Moldafsky and Fran Ruth of Van Nuys dubbed 
theirs a holy union. Ayers offers other suggestions, including union ceremony, 
commitment ceremony, ceremony of the heart and life-partnership ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
 Partner is considered too legalistic and lover or boyfriend/girlfriend too 
restrictive and inconsequential. Stoddard chose spouse because "it strikes a 
balance between tradition and individuality." Other alternatives are mate or 
life mate or life's partner. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 While some gay couples formalize their union before clergy, others opt for a 
therapist or other officiator. Stoddard and Rieman self-officiated the ceremony 
with a simple exchange of vows in front of family, friends and co-workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Couples not affiliated with a gay-friendly congregation (most major cities 
have a Metropolitan Community Church or Dignity annex) face the hit-or-miss 
approach. 
</P>
<P>
 Many ministers and rabbis who agree to officiate gay marriages ask couples to 
attend counseling sessions before setting a date. Rabbi Denise L. Eger of 
Congregation Kol Ami in West Hollywood and the Rev. Malcolm Boyd, an 
Episcopalian minister in Los Angeles, require couples be together for about a 
year before they'll consider marrying them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like to meet with couples several times, get to know them and give them a 
chance to work on questions and problems," said Boyd, who delves into such 
aspects as their identity as individuals and as a couple, as well as how a 
wedding will affect relationships with their parents and siblings. 
</P>
<P>
 Eger suggests that after the ceremony, couples look into legal steps they can 
take to fortify their union, such as partnership contracts, wills, a durable 
power of attorney or a partnership agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 "Through a business partnership contract, gay and lesbian couples can actually 
decide what and how they want to share," said Encino lawyer Diane Goodman. That 
includes real estate, medical and insurance benefits, and past and future 
income. 
</P>
<P>
 Such agreements are desirable in same-sex unions because the exchange of vows 
is not legally binding and doesn't automatically make the couples subject to 
certain tax and property laws. 
</P>
<P>
 A partnership agreement -- which differs from a business partnership contract 
in that it covers non-financial matters -- is the best way to clarify the 
commitment, "since what one partner means by sharing may not be what the other 
partner means," said Los Angeles lawyer Mary Newcomb. "You can create the 
boundaries according to your own needs." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Couples say the effect of a wedding announcement on employers and families can 
range from acceptance to hostility. For gays who are open and comfortable in 
their jobs, the move is usually greeted positively. 
</P>
<P>
 But some say it's best to proceed with caution. Moldafsky had just started a 
job in advertising and was unsure what her employer's reaction would be, so she 
didn't tell anyone until a year after her ceremony. Rieman had just been made a 
partner in a major New York law firm and warned his employers that his ceremony 
would likely receive media attention (his wedding to Stoddard was written about 
in the New Yorker and other publications). 
</P>
<P>
 When Ziemer made Bruner the beneficiary on his life insurance policy, listing 
him as life mate, "they checked into my medical status right away, which I 
don't think would have happened if I had listed a wife as beneficiary," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Of even longer-term consequence are family reactions. Eger will sometimes 
agree to counsel parents and siblings: "Gay ceremonies can be healing moments 
for parents. They may not have previously seen the relationship as legitimate. 
But they can relate to a wedding." Such a positive outcome is not always 
possible, however, she advises. "(Gay couples) sometimes need to accept that a 
parent or sibling simply can't deal with it." 
</P>
<P>
 Bruce Gates, who wed Charles Herrera in January, considers himself one of the 
lucky ones. His whole family came to the Los Angeles couple's ceremony. 
Herrera's sisters didn't attend; one couldn't make it, the other said she "just 
didn't believe in it." 
</P>
<P>
 In New York, Stoddard's mother also stayed away. But he believes the symbolic 
nature of the event helped her come around. "She called and apologized and said 
she was disappointed she hadn't come. Then she sent us a silver pitcher with a 
note: 'I wish you a long and blessed union.' Symbols do matter." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Taking a cue from heterosexual ceremonies, gay couples have created variations 
of the ritual to suit their particular needs, everything from the walk down the 
aisle to the actual vows. 
</P>
<P>
 Same-sex couples are usually not formally given away. Many couples have two or 
more witnesses, either best friends or siblings. On occasion, Boyd said, he has 
officiated unions with large wedding parties, bridesmaids, ushers -- the works. 
</P>
<P>
 Stoddard and Rieman originally planned to choose a same-sex rite from among 
those that existed in Europe from the 8th to the 15th centuries, "but they were 
simply too religious for our purpose," Stoddard said. "Instead, we created a 
Quaker-style commitment statement." 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, Moldafsky and Ruth were united with both Jewish and Christian 
blessings, under a huppah , with two glasses to break at the end of the 
ceremony. Many of their gay-couple friends didn't understand why they went to 
such elaborate lengths.  
</P>
<P>
 "It was only after the ceremony that they understood how much a spiritual 
commitment changes your feelings, makes them stronger, more solid," Moldafsky 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Boyd reads from Corinthians and Paul about the nature of love, while Eger 
gives the couple to one another, which many gay couples prefer to being 
pronounced some variation of husband and wife. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Attire is generally traditional. Men wear suits or matching tuxedos; women 
wear dresses, sometimes even bridal gowns, or both may wear tuxes. One playful 
variation, said Matt Giovanni, head of the Vermont-based Pride, Love and Union 
Services, was a "Star Trek"-themed wedding he helped plan; everyone came as 
characters from the popular sci-fi series. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there's the burning question of what to put atop the wedding cake. Bruner 
sawed two male-female couples apart and kept the two grooms. 
</P>
<P>
 Some couples prefer a gay-friendly atmosphere for their honeymoon. Options 
include gay cruises available through RSVP, Atlantis and, for women, Olivia, 
which also offers on-board commitment ceremonies. 
</P>
<P>
 But many don't want to be limited to an all-gay environment. Billy Colber of 
Out and About said deluxe cruises or resorts are an option, "since discretion 
is one of the advantages of deluxe accommodations." On a more moderate level, 
there are gay guest houses in Palm Springs, Santa Fe, Hawaii and the Caribbean. 
Some gay-friendly or gay-owned bed-and-breakfast establishments provide wedding 
banquet facilities for couples who want to share both their union and honeymoon 
with family and friends. 
</P>
<P>
 And should the dream union not work out, Boyd suggests a formal dissolution 
service "to free a couple . . . so they can get on with their lives."

COMMITTMENTS; LOCKED IN THE CLUTCHES OF AN UNSEEMLY LUST FOR LEISURE 
</P>

<BYLINE>

<P>
 It's a slow afternoon. So slow, in fact, that Jerry, an American male in early 
midlife, is spending a little time working on his triangles. He draws a real 
good one. 
</P>
<P>
 His neighbor drops by and is impressed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Great triangle, Jer." 
</P>
<P>
 This is familiar, right? 
</P>
<P>
 We all know lots of people hovering around the age of 40, with no kids or pets 
or spouses or all-consuming jobs, right? People who wake up every day with the 
choice of doing just about anything or nothing at all, right? 
</P>
<P>
 No? But that's the way things are on "Seinfeld," merely the most popular show 
on television, even though a lot of the people who watch it are time-starved 
yuppies with dual careers and heavily scheduled kids. 
</P>
<P>
 Call it time porn. Just as sexual pornography titillates us with images from a 
forbidden world in which casual sex is there for the taking, do modern images, 
on television shows and in advertising, show us free time, a thing we covet but 
cannot have? 
</P>
<P>
 The characters of "Seinfeld" wallow obscenely in unscheduled time, as did the 
characters on "Cheers," probably the mother of all time-porn shows. Some of the 
others, recently described by one critic as "Peter Pan shows," are "Mad About 
You," "Love and War" and "These Friends of Mine." 
</P>
<P>
 In advertising, time-porn images are most obvious in the languid lassitude of 
models in clothing catalogues such as J. Crew and Tweeds, which an article in 
Utne Reader magazine recently described as resembling "an advertisement for 
chronic fatigue syndrome." 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't sell a product with sex anymore. Nobody has time to have sex," 
jokes Dik Haddad, creative director at the Avon, Conn., advertising agency 
Mintz & Hoke. 
</P>
<P>
 If it isn't clothes, it's cars. To watch automobile commercials, one would 
think cars were mainly used as a way of getting up on top of buttes to drink in 
the sunset. 
</P>
<P>
 Brian Barry, chairman of sociology at Rochester Institute of Technology, cites 
a commercial of a few years ago in which two CEO types talk about a third CEO 
type who has chosen to drive to a meeting in his luxury automobile. 
</P>
<P>
 "We see this guy going through these uncluttered roads. What a joy," Barry 
says. "In reality, he's probably stuck behind somebody, steaming. 
</P>
<P>
 "The open road is no longer there, but it's still the vehicle for showcasing 
the car." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 There's an irony in selling cars this way, says Robert Thompson, professor of 
television at Syracuse University. 
</P>
<P>
 "People's most unfree, unpleasant, structured times of their lives are . . . 
commuting," he says. "The automobile for many people is almost a coffin." 
</P>
<P>
 In its early days -- even after Henry Ford started mass-producing in 1914 -- 
the automobile was, in fact, intended as an adjunct to leisure. It was a 
plaything and a way for people to travel easily to places of recreation, writes 
Witold Rybczynski in his 1991 book, "Waiting for the Weekend." 
</P>
<P>
 Only later did it become primarily a means of commuting to work. In the last 
decade, the car has undergone another, even more time-oppressing, 
transformation, as the insertion of cellular phones and even in-car fax 
machines have made it a place of work. 
</P>
<P>
 "Baby boomers have this vision of what they're supposed to be doing," says 
advertising man Haddad. "They think: I should be sitting on that porch in my 
Dockers with my white turtleneck sweater draped over my shoulders, looking out 
at the ocean. And they're killing themselves to get there." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Haddad says he doesn't design advertising to appeal to voyeuristic lusts for 
leisure time. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wish I were that clever," he says. "We don't usually approach it that way, 
but that doesn't mean that everybody else isn't doing it." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm convinced that work is increasing," says University of Iowa leisure 
studies professor Benjamin Hunnicutt, author of the book "Work Without End," 
which, like Harvard economist Juliet Schor's 1991 book "The Overworked 
American: The Unexpected Decline of Leisure," argues that Americans, in recent 
years, have been logging longer hours on the job. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's more convincing to me is how people talk and think about work and 
leisure," Hunnicutt says. "The cultural expectation is that work is the 
satisfying thing, the way one finds one's identity." 
</P>
<P>
 At least one survey, Hunnicutt says, showed that while most Americans expect 
their jobs to define and give meaning to their lives, at least one-third were 
in jobs that fell short of those expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is this disquiet with what work is giving us," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 If the characters on "Seinfeld" and other Peter Pan sitcoms define themselves 
more through their leisure activities, they may be setting a positive, useful 
example, not a peephole glimpse at guilty pleasures, Hunnicutt says. 
</P>
<P>
 "The attraction is: Maybe there's another way to do things," he says. "Maybe 
it's offering more of a critical vision. I would put my oar in the water for 
not characterizing it as pornography but as a wistful hope of something better. 
There might be something better than working all the time. Maybe it's a good 
sex manual instead of pornography."

COMMITTMENTS; CAN THIS MARIAGE BE SAVED?; FOR WARRING COUPLE, IT'S WHAT THEY 
DON'T SAY

 "I'm so lonely I can't help wishing I were still single," sighs Suzanne, 33, 
who owns a small dressmaking business. When she met Joe, who is seven years 
younger, "I knew I was in love," she recalls. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, to make sure they were right for each other, they decided to live 
together for six months. "By that time we were positive we knew each other 
well," she adds. "We had the most lavish wedding and honeymoon. How could we 
have been so wrong?" 
</P>
<P>
 Now, just shy of their first anniversary, they battle constantly -- almost 
always about money. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to enjoy life while we're still young," explains Suzanne, who vividly 
remembers how her parents denied themselves any enjoyment because they were 
afraid they wouldn't have enough money when they got older. And she's seen too 
many of her friends' marriages collapse because they placed too much emphasis 
on their careers. 
</P>
<P>
 But even though the couple has paid off all debts from their wedding, Joe, a 
computer technician, is a workaholic and insists on saving every penny. Time 
and again, she has, with much embarrassment, canceled social plans at the last 
minute because Joe accepted yet another assignment. Although she loves Joe, she 
thinks their ideas of what a couple needs are too far apart: "I refuse to 
settle for half a marriage." 
</P>
<P>
 Joe, 26, is flabbergasted that Suzanne is unhappy enough to seek counseling. 
He, too, loved their wedding but was shocked to see how much they had actually 
spent. 
</P>
<P>
 Joe had never been in debt before, and it made him upset and anxious. "My 
grandfather always told me, 'Spend $4 out of every five you make and put $1 
away for the future." Joe thinks Suzanne acts like a spoiled teen-ager. He 
hates to see his wife upset but abhors arguing with her. 
</P>
<P>
 "While the obvious problem is that Joe and Suzanne are not communicating, the 
key issue, which they are unaware of, is the underlying power struggle that 
precipitates their bickering," says Jane Greer, a marriage counselor in private 
practice in New York City and Douglaston, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
 Many couples have preconceived notions of whom their ideal mate will be. 
Because they are in love, they idealize their partners, but that can often 
obscure the expectations each has for marriage. They may not discover until 
much later that some of their deepest values are in conflict. For instance, Joe 
was driven by a need for financial security and was shocked at his wife's 
cavalier attitude toward their future. Suzanne was influenced by her parents, 
who continued to deny themselves any happiness. Each assumed the other felt the 
same way. 
</P>
<P>
 Could unspoken expectations be at the root of your arguments? To find out, 
write down five characteristics or qualities you hope to find in a partner. 
Also jot down five things that you hope will never surface. Be honest.  
</P>
<P>
 When Suzanne and Joe compared lists, they saw they had noted many of the same 
qualities: being open and honest with each other emotionally, spending time 
together, mutual trust and respect. This exercise gave them the courage to work 
on compromises. 
</P>
<P>
 Suzanne and Joe mapped out a social schedule together, and because she had 
listed keeping promises as one of her essential characteristics, Joe vowed to 
respect these plans. Seeing his effort, Suzanne became less argumentative, 
which eased the tension and did much to pave the way for further changes. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, they make an effort to spend time together -- over coffee in the morning, 
at dinner, whenever they can grab a few minutes to discuss what they believe in 
and dream about. This, too, helps them reaffirm how much they do have in 
common.

A CHANGING CLIMATE IN O.C. PHILANTHROPY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The timing couldn't have been worse when the Orange County Marine Institute 
unveiled its $7.5-million building plan in 1990. Southern California's economy 
was in a tailspin and contributions from real estate developers, long the 
county's main source of philanthropic contributions, were disappearing. 
</P>
<P>
 But rather than waiting for developers to regain their financial health, the 
institute started knocking on doors of local companies with strong ties to the 
ocean. That door-to-door approach has paid off: During the past three years, 
the Corona del Mar-based Surf Industry Manufacturers Assn. has donated more 
than $60,000 to the institute's capital fund. 
</P>
<P>
 The contribution will be blended with other gifts as the institute works 
toward its goal of building a new marine education institute valued at more 
than $20 million. And SIMA's contribution has led to a second level of support: 
Accountants, lawyers and other companies that work with surf apparel companies 
also have started to make donations. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an interesting partnership because without the ocean, the surf industry 
isn't going to survive," said Stan Cummings, executive director of the Marine 
Institute, who senses "a (growing) general awareness in the business community 
of the importance of environmental matters . . . and there's less of the 'us 
and them' mentality." 
</P>
<P>
 As government funding and donations from traditional business sources 
disappear, conservation and environmental advocacy groups such as the Marine 
Institute are increasingly turning to companies that have a vested interest in 
ensuring that surfers, cyclists, hikers and climbers have safe and easy access 
to trails, open space and oceans. 
</P>
<P>
 Cummings said he doesn't expect developers to reprise their prominence as the 
county's leading source of philanthropic funding. "Orange County is maturing," 
he said. "Developers helped to ensure that cultural facilities are begun and 
now it's time for other industries to come into the fore." 
</P>
<P>
 Some of those alternative companies are starting to fund environmental and 
conservation organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's in our interest for people to have places to go and enjoy the outdoors," 
said Marianne Jones, a full-time grants administrator for Sumner, Wash.-based 
Recreational Equipment Inc., who processes hundreds of grant requests each 
month. "We want people to have space to use our products but it has to make 
good business sense. . . . You don't want (corporate directors) questioning why 
you're giving money away." 
</P>
<P>
 Most larger companies are geared up to deal with larger, better-established 
conservation groups that have longstanding track records like the Sierra Club 
or the Nature Conservancy, said Pam Maurath, an official with the Environmental 
Grantmakers Assn., a New York-based group that represents 172 businesses and 
nonprofit groups that contribute to various green organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 However, most smaller organizations lack the sophistication needed to make 
effective funding pitches to large, faraway companies. 
</P>
<P>
 But neighborhood activists have few qualms about approaching smaller companies 
that make products -- surfboards, hiking boots, tents, etc. -- that are used in 
the outdoors. 
</P>
<P>
 Outdoor clothing and equipment manufacturers responded to the growing number 
of requests by forming an industry group that, like the surf industry 
association, directs funds into grass-roots groups. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1989, REI, Patagonia, Adventure 16 and nearly 40 other outdoors equipment 
and clothing companies created the Conservation Alliance, a nonprofit outfit 
that has handed out more than $1 million in donations. Most of the alliance's 
grants are for $30,000 or less, and all are directed at smaller, nonprofit 
organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of the best work is being done by 10 people gathering around a coffee 
table who want to change something on their block," said Steve Barker, 
president of Eagle Creek Travel Gear in Escondido. "The big companies aren't 
likely to give them any money because they're not sophisticated enough. But a 
buck takes them a long way and that's what we like . . . we get a lot of 
go-power for our money." 
</P>
<P>
 Eagle Creek Travel Gear is active in its own back yard. The company, which 
manufactures backpacks and other gear, is supporting a group that's trying to 
preserve what's left of the nearby Escondido Creek's natural habitat. The 
company also helped to rescue a local Sierra Club essay contest that was 
endangered by a funding shortfall. 
</P>
<P>
 Conservation Alliance grants are being used to protect the largest remaining 
unprotected virgin redwood grove in Northern California, to expand and maintain 
hiking trails in the Adirondack Mountains and to support legislators who want 
to remove 12 dams on rivers in Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
 Surf industry companies also are targeting grass-roots conservation groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Club Sportswear in Irvine is donating portions of its "Ecology Tees" T-shirt 
line to the Surfrider Foundation. Similarly, Freestyle, a Camarillo-based 
sports watch manufacturer, contributes proceeds from the sale of a line of 
bracelets it makes to American Oceans Campaign, a Santa Monica-based 
organization that lobbies for legislation to protect the oceans. 
</P>
<P>
 Barker said that the greening of corporate giving is a "lifestyle choice. . . 
. People are still dressing up to go to an opera or symphony fund-raisers 
because it's something that should be done." 
</P>
<P>
 "But we're also trying to help local grass-roots groups that are the most in 
need of funds and are small enough where we can make an impact with our limited 
funds." 
</P>
<P>
 That's a significant change for some manufacturers who previously limited 
their support of environmental causes to outfitting high-profile expeditions to 
the Amazon or Antarctica. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, there's "less of the 'me and 75 Sherpas (mountain guides) are going to 
climb a mountain' and more of a trend toward people who are volunteering to 
work on an environmental project that truly benefits the ecology," Barker said. 
</P>
<P>
 That's the driving force behind the surf industry manufacturers' decision to 
fund three Southern California organizations that are working to protect the 
Pacific Ocean. 
</P>
<P>
 Proceeds from SIMA's fifth annual Waterman's Ball gala on Saturday will 
support the Marine Institute, American Oceans Campaign and the San 
Clemente-based Surfrider Foundation. The 1993 ball raised a total of $75,000 
that was split equally among the three groups. Saturday's affair was expected 
to generate about $150,000. 
</P>
<P>
 SIMA raises funds through ticket sales to the gala and an auction that 
includes surfboards, clothing and all-expense-paid trips to idyllic surfing 
spots. And it capitalizes on its strong Hollywood connections to help auction 
walk-on roles on television shows, including "Coach" and "Murphy Brown." 
</P>
<P>
 Actor Ted Danson, founder and president of American Oceans, is one of SIMA's 
strongest supporters. "What I do is shine a light on issues," Danson said. "But 
what these (business leaders) are doing is actually responding to the issues." 
</P>
<P>
 Danson helped to establish American Oceans in 1987 in order to go head-to-head 
with big oil companies on the volatile issue of offshore oil drilling. 
</P>
<P>
 SIMA members are excited by one of American Oceans' latest projects -- an 
automotive oil recycling program for Los Angeles city residents. Co-sponsored 
by Unocal, the program is designed to intercept the thousands of gallons of 
motor oil that are dumped into storm drains that empty into the Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
 Danson applauded Unocal, usually the target of environmentalists' ire, for its 
willingness to join the recycling program. 
</P>
<P>
 "The issues are so huge that we didn't want to just sit there stuck in a 
brick-throwing mentality," Danson said. "We've been fighting them for so long 
that we've become friends. . . . We both agreed to sit down and agree on this 
one issue and agree to disagree on other issues." 
</P>
<P>
 Freestyle Vice President Jimmy Olmos said that business support for 
environmental causes is, in part, selfish. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of us in the surf industry live at or near the beach," Olmos said. "And 
we all have young children. We're realizing that the children love the ocean 
but it's getting more difficult for them to get into the water. 
</P>
<P>
 Employers also are making it increasingly easy for employees to make green 
donations. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 150 companies with operations in California -- including Wells Fargo 
Bank, Patagonia and Recreational Equipment Inc. -- give environmental 
organizations access to their employees' donations through automatic payroll 
deductions.

TIMES O.C. POLL; MOST DON'T SEE BIG DOWNSIDE IF RAMS LEAVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Voters have little interest in spending taxpayer money to keep the Los Angeles 
Rams in Orange County, reflecting their sense that the team's departure would 
not severely affect the county's image, according to a Times Orange County 
Poll. 
</P>
<P>
 The poll, conducted by Mark Baldassare & Associates, found that only three in 
10 county voters feel keeping the Rams is important to them personally, while 
nearly 70% say it is unimportant. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's not a whole lot of good will or good feeling toward the Rams," said 
Baldassare, who polled 600 Orange County registered voters May 19-22 for The 
Times. "It doesn't appear that people are interested in keeping the team." 
</P>
<P>
 The lack of support for the Rams is evenly spread, with little difference of 
opinion among different age groups or between men and women. North County 
residents, however, are slightly more likely than those in South County to say 
the team benefits the economy. 
</P>
<P>
 The poll finds Anaheim city officials, who have been unwilling to spend 
taxpayer money to build the Rams a new stadium, in step with voter sentiment. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams exercised a 15-month escape clause in their Anaheim Stadium lease 
last month and are seeking offers to move the franchise to another state. Rams 
officials claim their arrangement in Anaheim is not profitable and they want to 
move where they can make more money. 
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim officials say they can't compete with the financial packages being put 
together by cities such as Baltimore and St. Louis, and have asked county 
government to chip in. 
</P>
<P>
 But voters apparently don't want the county government involved. 
</P>
<P>
 Fully three in four voters oppose any county government "financial assistance" 
to keep the Rams; 21% favor some type of monetary support. 
</P>
<P>
 County residents are frustrated with the team's current ownership, consecutive 
losing seasons and player personnel changes, as well as the Rams' lack of 
commitment to the community, according to interviews with poll respondents. 
</P>
<P>
 "The present ownership has done a lousy job," said Alex Ribakoff, 40, an 
Irvine attorney. "I have a problem with government subsidies of sport 
franchises in general. I think the money spent never gets returned to the 
community." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams have made no effort to reach out to the community and even refused to 
change their name when they moved from Los Angeles, he said, adding, "I resent 
that. I frankly think (the Rams) are going to be replaced." 
</P>
<P>
 Alfred Srnka of Garden Grove said he will miss the team if it moves but does 
not believe the county should pay to keep the franchise. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to lose them, but I feel the ball teams are making enough 
money," said Srnka, 65, a real estate broker and polka-band member. "There's so 
much money in sports now that the owners should be able to take care of 
things." 
</P>
<P>
 Keri Owens, 21, of Anaheim said she does not think it is "ethical" to give 
money to the Rams "when there are so many other important things that need to 
be funded." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps significant in making up some people's minds is the belief, among a 
substantial minority, that the county's economic health is not tied to the 
team's staying. Some 37% say the team is unimportant to the local economy, with 
59% saying the Rams help the local economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Andrew Crowell said losing the team would be a damaging blow. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would have a great impact if they left," said Crowell, 62, of Laguna 
Beach. "I want to cut taxes, but I think there is enough money around to spend 
on the team. They bring in a lot of business to the county." 
</P>
<P>
 Crowell added: "I think the team is a good team. People can't expect them to 
win all time." 
</P>
<P>
 To most, the prestige value of the team to the county is even less important 
than the team's economic benefits. Slightly more than four in 10 call the 
franchise important to the county's image, with 54% saying it is unimportant. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think it will matter much if they leave," Owens said. "It's not like 
we have a shortage of professional sports teams here. We have the (California) 
Angels and the Mighty Ducks hockey team. . . . It won't bother me at all if the 
Rams leave." How the Poll Was Done 
</P>
<P>
 The Times Orange County Poll was conducted by Mark Baldassare and Associates. 
The telephone survey of 600 Orange County registered voters was conducted May 
19-22 on weekday nights and weekend days. The margin of error for the total 
sample is plus or minus 4%. Times Orange County Poll: Lackluster Support for 
Rams 
</P>
<P>
 Two-thirds of Orange County voters say it is not important to them that the 
Rams stay in Orange County. And three-quarters are against having the county 
government offer financial assistance to keep the team here.

VALLEY DOCTOR IN DRUG CASE FIGHTS FOR LICENSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK CHEEVERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The night his girlfriend died in his bed of a massive cocaine overdose, Dr. 
Stan Azen's long affair with drugs finally capsized his life. 
</P>
<P>
 The veteran emergency-room physician later was arrested and convicted of 
possessing cocaine. His $400,000 house was seized under federal anti-drug laws. 
And he admitted in a public hearing that he was an addict who had abused drugs 
for 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Azen managed to cling to his career. He swore off cocaine, enrolled at the 
Betty Ford Center and passed numerous random drug tests. Meanwhile, he worked 
at two San Fernando Valley hospitals that serve many low-income people, earning 
high praise from colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is definitely one of the best ER physicians I have ever known. . . . He is 
a kind, compassionate physician in the best sense," said Dr. Jonathan Serebrin, 
emergency-room chief at the Medical Center of North Hollywood, where Azen 
worked for nine years. 
</P>
<P>
 But late last month, nearly four years after his girlfriend's death, the state 
Medical Board opened trial-like hearings that could cost Azen, 42, his license 
to practice. The board charges, among other things, that Azen gave his 
girlfriend cocaine the night she died, that he was under the influence of drugs 
and alcohol when he tried to resuscitate her and that he continued to buy, sell 
and use drugs after her death. 
</P>
<P>
 Azen denies the allegations. And in an unusual twist, he is drawing vocal 
support from other doctors who believe he is clean and sober and should be 
allowed to continue caring for low-income and minority patients in the east San 
Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems inappropriate to remove a . . . board-certified, American-trained 
physician from a population that rarely has access to such quality of care and 
competence," said Dr. Val Warhaft, who heads the emergency department at 
Pacifica Hospital of the Valley, a Sun Valley facility that cares for many poor 
Latinos and where Azen worked until recently. 
</P>
<P>
 Azen's case poses a dilemma for the medical board, which must decide how 
severely to punish an admitted onetime drug abuser who also is seen as a 
talented physician dedicated to helping a clientele often under-served by 
medical professionals. The board can revoke Azen's license, suspend it or place 
him on probation. 
</P>
<P>
 Azen says he has not touched drugs in three years and no longer has any desire 
for them. He insists his years of drug abuse never affected patients. And he is 
angry that the medical board chose to take disciplinary action against him, 
rather than place him in a diversion program. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never had a malpractice suit. I never had an accusation of drug use at 
work," he said in an interview. "They had people in diversion that were drunk 
during operations. There was one doctor who left a twin in (during delivery) 
while using Demerol. There were people shooting up in their office and seeing 
patients while impaired. I was convicted of one count of using cocaine at my 
house." 
</P>
<P>
 Since his girlfriend's 1990 death, Azen has been buried beneath an avalanche 
of legal and personal problems. 
</P>
<P>
 His former Westside home and Jeep Cherokee were seized under federal asset 
forfeiture laws, although the Jeep was later returned. 
</P>
<P>
 In March, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration revoked his certificate of 
registration, a crucial permit for emergency-room physicians to prescribe 
pain-killing narcotics like codeine. 
</P>
<P>
 The DEA said in a written decision that it was "inconsistent with the public 
interest" to let Azen keep his certificate in light of his lengthy history of 
drug abuse, including his admitted use of cocaine with his girlfriend on the 
night she died. 
</P>
<P>
 The revocation cost Azen his job at Pacifica Hospital, which he had held since 
September, 1991. Before that, his arrest and ensuing legal difficulties cost 
him jobs at the Medical Center of North Hollywood and at Westside Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 In hearings last year that led to loss of his DEA license, Azen, who now lives 
in Sherman Oaks, testified that he began experimenting with marijuana and 
cocaine in the 1970s and became "a regular cocaine user" in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 A graduate of Loma Linda University medical school, Azen was hired in 1982 in 
the emergency room at the Medical Center of North Hollywood, where he quickly 
learned to cope with waves of shootings, stabbings and car-crash victims. 
</P>
<P>
 By 1987, he was working up to 90 hours a week, collecting $240,000 a year. And 
there was a romantic bonus: At the hospital he had met a quiet, young auditor, 
Donna Lynn Miller, who soon moved in with him. 
</P>
<P>
 But with a fat paycheck and a high-stress job, Azen also had developed a 
serious cocaine habit, according to his DEA testimony. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes he snorted it. Sometimes he sprinkled it on marijuana cigarettes and 
smoked it, a combination known in drug circles as "coco puffs." 
</P>
<P>
 As his cocaine intake escalated, he tried to ration himself, methodically 
weighing out half-gram doses on a scale at his home. 
</P>
<P>
 "As my habit got worse, I didn't want to, in quotes, abuse it, in my mind, and 
therefore I would weigh out certain amounts to use on a daily basis," he 
testified. 
</P>
<P>
 Azen denied using drugs on the job. But a longtime friend told state 
investigators the physician had a "high tolerance" for cocaine and used it to 
stay awake during his long hours at work. 
</P>
<P>
 After Miller moved in, Azen's house became a constant gathering spot for 
several of their friends, who often barbecued, played volleyball and used drugs 
together "for days on end," Azen said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were kind of like a little family together," he testified, adding that he 
supplied some of the cocaine for group parties. 
</P>
<P>
 Then came the night of Sept. 20, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Azen said he came home from work, ate dinner with Miller and watched TV. The 
couple snorted cocaine, smoked marijuana and had a couple of drinks apiece. 
Then they made love and went to sleep. 
</P>
<P>
 Azen told police Miller later got up and went to the bathroom. When she 
returned to bed, however, something was wrong. She had two seizures and lost 
consciousness. 
</P>
<P>
 Azen said he performed cardiopulmonary resuscitation on Miller, but she did 
not respond. He later dialed 911. By the time paramedics arrived, just after 3 
a.m., Miller, then 28, was dead. 
</P>
<P>
 A pathologist estimated that she had 20 times a fatal dose of cocaine in her 
system. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview, Azen described Miller as an addict and alcoholic who had "a 
death wish" and had once tried to kill herself. At the time of her death, he 
said, she was attending a Westside community college and drinking heavily. 
</P>
<P>
 "She had no self-esteem. She wasn't working," he said. "She was obviously a 
very diseased person." 
</P>
<P>
 Azen said although he and Miller had used cocaine together in the past, he did 
not supply her drugs on the night she died. She had her "own sources," he said, 
and also possessed a key to a wall safe where he stored cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
 No criminal charges were filed against Azen in connection with Miller's death. 
But in April, 1991, he was arrested for allegedly selling cocaine to Miller's 
sister, who had been asked by police to try to buy drugs from Azen. Police said 
they searched his home and turned up 61 grams of cocaine, scales and packaging 
materials. 
</P>
<P>
 A judge, however, said later the bust was questionable because police had not 
thoroughly searched the sister to make sure she was not carrying drugs before 
she entered Azen's house. 
</P>
<P>
 In a plea bargain that got him off the hook on a more serious charge of 
possessing cocaine for sale, Azen was convicted of one count of simple 
possession of cocaine and sentenced to six months in jail. He served only two 
days before being placed in a work furlough program. 
</P>
<P>
 Shaken by Miller's death and the crush of problems that ensued, Azen said he 
decided to stop using drugs. He enrolled in a Los Angeles outpatient clinic of 
the Betty Ford Center, a renowned Rancho Mirage substance-abuse treatment 
facility. Also, as part of the plea bargain, he was placed on probation for 
three years, requiring him to submit to random drug tests. 
</P>
<P>
 Azen said he has repeatedly passed the tests since his arrest. He offered to 
let the medical board take his license away without a legal fight if he ever 
tested positive for drugs again in his life. 
</P>
<P>
 A county probation officer testified at the DEA hearing that between December, 
1991, and December, 1992, Azen passed 22 random drug tests. Azen said he has 
passed more probation tests since, as well as tests ordered by Betty Ford 
counselors. 
</P>
<P>
 But state officials argue that the issue is not whether Azen is drug-free now, 
but whether he broke drug laws and committed serious errors in medical judgment 
in the past. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy state Atty. Gen. Robert McKim Bell, who is prosecuting Azen, said he 
was negligent in not seeking help for his addiction and for continuing to treat 
patients while addicted. 
</P>
<P>
 He said Azen broke the law by providing drugs to Miller and others. And by 
giving cocaine to Miller, who had a history of seizures, Azen risked her health 
because the drug has seizure-inducing properties, Bell said. 
</P>
<P>
 "His girlfriend had misused drugs to the point where her nose had been 
partially eaten away, and to have allowed her to continue to worsen her 
situation, contrary to medical advice she had received from her plastic 
surgeon, seemed to us antithetical to the general objectives of good medicine," 
Bell said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bell also charged that Azen performed CPR on Miller while impaired by drugs 
and alcohol, and waited 30 minutes after she stopped breathing before dialing 
911 for paramedic assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's important to determine whether Dr. Azen is a risk to the client 
population he serves, and it's also important to deter other physicians from 
getting engaged in similar misconduct," Bell said. 
</P>
<P>
 Azen said he had eaten dinner and slept for a while before Miller's seizure, 
and was sober. He said he did not call 911 because the telephone was in the 
kitchen, several rooms away. Running to it would have meant stopping CPR, which 
is not supposed to be interrupted once begun, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Only days before the medical board hearings opened, Azen lost his third job 
since his arrest when he was terminated at Pacifica Hospital for not having a 
DEA license. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the DEA revoked his permit March 3, he continued to practice at the 
hospital without it until May 15. Azen said patient care was not compromised 
because he still could get narcotic medications from the hospital pharmacy, 
which has its own DEA certificate. 
</P>
<P>
 Azen said not having the permit slowed him down on the job but did not cripple 
him. But in an appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court, his lawyer wrote that Azen 
would be "unable to work as an emergency room physician" without the permit. 
</P>
<P>
 Pacifica Executive Director Ermanno Mariani said Azen was dismissed because he 
could not function properly in the emergency room without his drug license. But 
he added that Azen was a good doctor he would gladly take back if his legal 
problems are resolved -- a sentiment repeated by others with whom Azen has 
worked at the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 Located across from the railroad tracks in a dusty, mostly Latino 
neighborhood, Pacifica is a small community hospital best known as the place 
Rodney King was treated after he was beaten by police three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The neighborhood is a poor one, and Pacifica's busy ER could double as the set 
for "St. Elsewhere." More than 1,400 sick people are seen there each month, 
many of them uninsured or on Medi-Cal. The clientele includes a hefty share of 
squalling babies as well as gang members with bullet or knife wounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike their colleagues who practice in more leisurely surroundings, ER 
doctors describe what they do as "gut medicine" -- making snap decisions in 
life-or-death situations. And among Pacifica's ER physicians, Azen is known as 
a gut-medicine star. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've heard other doctors call him a doctor's doctor," said Warhaft, Azen's 
former boss, as he sat in a tiny doctor's lounge just off the emergency room. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's probably one of the 10 or 20 best clinicians in the country," said Dr. 
Rick Key, another ER physician who sprawled on a nearby cot, lunching on 
takeout. 
</P>
<P>
 Key and Warhaft told several stories about how Azen's incisive diagnosis and 
creative treatment saved lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Key, who has known Azen for 10 years, recalled one incident in which a man 
overdosed on digitalis, a heart stimulant. The man's heart was beating in a 
rapid, uncoordinated way, a potentially lethal condition. 
</P>
<P>
 Azen tried the standard treatment, electroshock paddles, but the man's heart 
kept convulsing wildly. Switching strategy, Azen injected the man with a big 
dose of potassium, stopping the heart. Then, using a pacemaker, Azen restarted 
it, and its beat returned to normal. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's as brilliant as you'll ever see in medicine, to do that on the spot," 
Key said. 
</P>
<P>
 Key and Warhaft said they never saw Azen impaired at work and would love to 
see him return. The medical board action against him, they said, doesn't make 
sense. 
</P>
<P>
 "The government is spending bread in the six figures to, if they succeed, 
remove a very good doctor from doing good work in a charity area," Key said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Stan liked working in a third world hospital and doing things for people who 
otherwise would never have the chance. That's the bottom line with Stan. He's a 
really nice guy. That's what makes this even worse."

 Mexico's soccer team ran onto the field Saturday in its traditional green 
shirts, white shorts and red knee-high stockings. Oh, except for Jorge Campos, 
the goalie, Senor Day-Glo, who wore another of his wild, colorful, clown-like 
costumes, usually seen only on Renaldo McDonald. 
</P>
<P>
 Then the team from the soccer-loving United States of America ran onto the 
Pasadena pasture before a tremendous crowd of 91,123, including the estimated 
1,123 who didn't come to cheer for Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 Final score? 
</P>
<P>
 Yankees 1, red socks nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 With a perfect pass from Eric Wynalda to Roy Wegerle that caught Campos out of 
position and resulted in what Wynalda called "90,000 worried-looking 
Mexican-Americans," the U.S. team won this final warm-up game, 1-0, to prepare 
itself for the serious kicking to come. 
</P>
<P>
 But the real winner? 
</P>
<P>
 Pasadena, USA. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, Pasadena, soccer capital of this great soccer-loving universe of ours, 
held one final full dress rehearsal Saturday on the same green, green grass 
where the World Cup tournament's July 17 championship game will be played. And 
Pasadena passed the test. Grass, great. Weather, warm. Organization, orderly. 
Crowd control, efficient. Excellent work by everybody here at the Toes Bowl.  
</P>
<P>
 We're ready for Soccer Summer '94. Soccer fever. Catch it. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. team looks ready, too. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked what the key to Saturday's 1-0 victory was, defender Cle Kooiman quickly 
said, "The zero goals against is the key. I'll tell you what, if we can stop 
teams from scoring, I can guarantee you at least three ties." 
</P>
<P>
 Good key, Cle. In the first round, the U.S. only plays three games. 
</P>
<P>
 And Mexico? 
</P>
<P>
 Well, it isn't yet evident whether Mexico's team is ready. The team has been 
victorious in only two of its seven pre-Cup games. On the other hand, it was 
playing Saturday without the great Luis Roberto Alves Zague, alias "Zaguinho," 
striker extraordinaire, and also without Hugo Sanchez, equally legendary 
striker, who recently gave an interview in which he said he was happy to 
"sacrifice my individual brilliance" for the sake of the team. Bravo, Hugo. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Mexico's many fans must be getting anxious. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody will panic over this, but it's still a great team," U.S. defender 
Alexi Lalas said. "Oh, I don't really care whether they panic or not." 
</P>
<P>
 Is Mexico's coach, Miguel Mejia Baron, panicky? 
</P>
<P>
 Hard to tell. In a lengthy post-game interview Saturday, the most outspoken 
comment Coach Baron made was that the World Cup will begin June 17. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point, Baron said of his team's performance, "The game just ended five 
minutes ago. This is a game that I have to think about once, twice, three 
times." 
</P>
<P>
 No problem, Miguel. Give us a call after your tri-think. 
</P>
<P>
 One reason Mexico's fans turned out in great numbers is because they cannot be 
positive they will see their heroes here in California again soon. The first 
three World Cup games for Mexico will be played in Washington, twice, and 
Orlando, Fla., not an easy commute. 
</P>
<P>
 So, you mean 91,000 fans came across the border for this one game? 
</P>
<P>
 "No, no, no," corrected the U.S. coach, Bora Milutinovic. "They live here. 
They didn't come from out of the country. Mexico's team is very much loved 
here." 
</P>
<P>
 More than our own team, maybe. 
</P>
<P>
 Wynalda was asked, "Did this feel like a road game to you?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Absolutely," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, they booed us," Wynalda said. "We got booed on our home field. That's a 
strange feeling, let me tell you." 
</P>
<P>
 Wynalda, the local-boy Westlake Villager, covered half of the San Fernando 
Valley on his way to assisting on the goal. He outran Ignacio Ambriz, got Raul 
Gutierrez to commit in midair, then faked out Juan Ramirez Perales by passing 
instead of shooting. By the time Ramon Ramirez could make a last-second lunge, 
Wegerle was booting the ball past the orange-yellow-purple-green sleeve of 
Campos into the lower-right webbing of the net. 
</P>
<P>
 Campos, said Wynalda, "He's always making forwards' life miserable. You never 
know what he's going to do. 
</P>
<P>
 "They said he didn't play the shot correctly. The way he plays, how can you 
tell?" 
</P>
<P>
 Well, you know how it is, Eric. 
</P>
<P>
 Everybody has an opinion, here in soccer-crazy America.

MIKE PENNER: CASH ISN'T A MAGRANE HEADACHE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 In the time that passed between Joe Magrane's last complete game and this one, 
the Angels fired Doug Rader, hired Buck Rodgers, fired Buck Rodgers, hired 
Marcel Lachemann, hired Dan O'Brien, fired Dan O'Brien, hired Whitey Herzog, 
retired Whitey Herzog, hired Bill Bavasi, changed uniforms, changed pitching 
coaches, changed just about everything, give or take their luck. 
</P>
<P>
 The key transaction there, of course, was hiring Whitey Herzog. 
</P>
<P>
 When he was released by the St. Louis Cardinals last August, Magrane was the 
right man at the right time -- that is, a former Cardinal looking for work 
while Herzog, the former head Cardinal, was in charge of player contracts for 
the California Angels. 
</P>
<P>
 Come on down, Whitey said, so Magrane did. 
</P>
<P>
 Pitch a few games for us, Whitey suggested, so Magrane did that, too. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon, Magrane was Jed Clampett. He was out one day, throwin' from a hill, and 
Whitey up and signed him for more than 13 mil.  
</P>
<P>
 Thirteen-point-three million, that is. 
</P>
<P>
 Dollar bills. 
</P>
<P>
 For four years. 
</P>
<P>
 Non-guaranteed. 
</P>
<P>
 At first, Magrane couldn't believe his incredible good fortune. The search of 
Whitey's gold -- that wasn't his intent. But what was Magrane supposed to do, 
run out the door with fistfuls of dollars being thrown at him? 
</P>
<P>
 Howls went up all over baseball. What in the world was Whitey thinking? 
Opening the vault for a just-released pitcher who had missed all of the 1991 
season after undergoing a radical reconstruction of his left elbow? What if the 
elbow blows out again? 
</P>
<P>
 The howlers were doing a lot of self-satisfied nodding in early February when 
the Angels announced Magrane would need arthroscopic surgery on that same 
elbow. And the timing: Days earlier, Herzog had resigned his position as Angels 
general manager. 
</P>
<P>
 Was Magrane the reason why? 
</P>
<P>
 So Whitey could get out of town before the bad news hit? 
</P>
<P>
 "I was almost embarrassed that I had to get surgery," Magrane says. "I know it 
was signed in good faith. I'd shown the Angels last year that I could throw 
eight innings, go 130 pitches. 
</P>
<P>
 "Still, I was almost embarrassed. I felt I was letting some people down." 
</P>
<P>
 For that reason, Magrane was in a particularly introspective mood following 
his 3-1 victory over Milwaukee at Anaheim Stadium Sunday afternoon. It was 
Magrane's first complete-game victory since June 22, 1990, and, in his words, 
tangible evidence to his teammates that he did not sign on last September just 
to become an extremely wealthy welfare case. 
</P>
<P>
 As he prepped for surgery four months ago, Magrane remembers that "I wasn't so 
much worried about my career. That was arthroscopic surgery, not the radical 
reconstruction I had done in '91. Dr. (Lewis) Yocum told me he just wanted to 
clean out some of the garbage in there. So I wasn't worried about that. 
</P>
<P>
 "But, obviously, I was concerned about earning my teammates' respect. I wanted 
them to believe they could depend on me." 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, in his sixth start of 1994, after two defeats, two no-decisions and a 
head-shaking 8.51 earned-run average, Magrane had something presentable to show 
them Sunday. He took a one-hitter into the seventh inning and a shutout into 
the ninth before settling for a four-hit, go-the-distance triumph. 
</P>
<P>
 As for puncturing the contract controversy, as it has been played out in 
newsprint and on radio talk shows, Magrane claims, "I don't read the paper. 
Most of that stuff is second-hand, third-hand, fourth-hand. 
</P>
<P>
 "The other 24 guys here -- what they think, that's what's important to me. And 
that's about it." 
</P>
<P>
 He will, however, take a few jabs at the perception that Whitey was merely 
taking care of a good ol' buddy when waved all those zeros under Magrane's nose 
last fall. 
</P>
<P>
 "The truth is," Magrane says, "that Whitey and I were never great friends. We 
weren't enemies, either. He was a great manager and I respected him for that, 
but it's not like we hung out together or anything like that. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's my perception, anyway, that players don't hang with coaches and 
managers, no matter who you are. So as far as Whitey looking out after 'a good 
friend,' I don't think that's a fair implication at all." 
</P>
<P>
 Magrane says he and Herzog haven't talked since Herzog left the organization. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm still kind of confused as to why he resigned," Magrane says. 
</P>
<P>
 And as for the heat Herzog took over the signing of that contract? 
</P>
<P>
 "Not my problem," Magrane flatly replies. "It's simply not my problem. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "You take a gamble any time you do something, whether you sign someone or make 
a pitch. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, the people who make the most good moves are the ones who win." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, Magrane points out, his contract "for all practical purposes is a 
two-year deal, with incentives built into it. (The last two years of the 
contract are option years.) I still have to produce to meet those incentives." 
</P>
<P>
 So Magrane doesn't apologize for the size of his contract. The way he looks at 
it, there is no shame in being labeled a "money pitcher," just as long as you 
pitch like one.
