 PLAY BALL: With the exhibition Freeway Series out of the way (C3), baseball 
begins for real this week with a different look. The Angels open Tuesday at 
Minnesota, but the teams are no longer American League West rivals. . . . 
Realignment has pushed the Twins, who have won two of the past seven World 
Series, to the new AL Central. "I'm not going to miss those guys," said Mark 
Langston, the Angels' opening night pitcher. "They were dangerous. You never 
knew when they were going to have a great year." 
</P>
<P>
 STAR QUALITY: When he was still with the Kansas City Royals, new Angel 
outfielder Bo Jackson was clowning around before a game at the Metrodome in 
Minneapolis. Jackson, who bats right-handed, told Twins All-Star Kirby Puckett 
he could hit from the other side. Puckett didn't believe him. . . . So Jackson 
turned around and hit a batting-practice pitch 450 feet into the stands 
left-handed and had a new fan. "You're my idol," Puckett said. Jackson has been 
less successful in games there, with just a .184 average and four home runs in 
87 at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
 SHOW TIME: Credit patience or a change of scenery, but Westminster High 
graduate Ryan Klesko has finally earned a spot with the Atlanta Braves after 
five seasons of trying. The former first baseman will share left field with two 
other rookies, including former Los Alamitos standout Mike Kelly. . . . "It's a 
new challenge for me," said Klesko, 22. He has been in the minor leagues since 
the Braves drafted him in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 ACTION! Infielder Kevin Elster's comeback was stalled last week when he was 
released by the San Diego Padres. But Elster, who played for Marina High and 
Golden West College in Huntington Beach and then the New York Mets before 
shoulder surgery in 1992, might have a career alternative. . . . He recently 
had a role in "Little, Big Leagues," an upcoming film about a kid who inherits 
a team and names himself manager. "I had to read for the part and then go back 
and read for it again," Elster said. "That was more pressure than anything I've 
ever experienced in baseball."

 FOR STARTERS: Want to make a major league starting rotation out of pitchers 
from the San Fernando Valley area? No problem. Start with three All-Stars. Bret 
Saberhagen of the New York Mets is from Cleveland High. Kevin Appier of the 
Kansas City Royals played at Antelope Valley High. Jack McDowell of the Chicago 
White Sox starred at Notre Dame High. . . . Add to that Saugus High's Roger 
Salkeld, who figures to be a top rookie with the Seattle Mariners. 
</P>
<P>
 THE RIGHT TIME: This season could be the turning point for several area 
players. Third baseman Jeff Cirillo, of Providence High in Burbank, had the 
most hits of any Milwaukee Brewer minor leaguer last season, and he's one step 
away from the majors. . . . Kennedy High's Garret Anderson (Angels), Hart's 
Andrew Lorraine (Angels), Chatsworth's Rich Aude (Pittsburgh Pirates) and Cal 
State Northridge's Craig Clayton (Seattle Mariners) are close too. 
</P>
<P>
 HE'LL MANAGE: The playing field isn't the only place where Valley area 
products turn up in the professional ranks. Taft High product Kevin Kennedy, 
above, enters his second season as manager of the Texas Rangers. And former 
Crespi High standout Rick Dempsey is managing a Dodgers' minor league team in 
Albuquerque. 
</P>
<P>
 THE OL' COLLEGE TRY: Cal State Northridge has sent a handful of players to the 
majors, including Jeremy Hernandez, one of the Cleveland Indians' top relief 
pitchers. . . . Former Matadors who played in the majors include Jason 
Thompson, Jim Vatcher, Gil Kubski and the late Lyman Bostock. 
</P>
<P>
 TOP THIS: Two players will be trying to match their career-best performances 
of 1993. Hart High's Todd Zeile, the St. Louis Cardinal third baseman, batted 
.277 with 17 home runs and 103 runs batted in last season. Grant High's Rod 
Beck, the San Francisco Giant relief pitcher, earned 48 saves, second best in 
baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 MISSING PERSON: Taft High's Robin Yount retired, ending a brilliant 20-year 
career with the Milwaukee Brewers.

 PLAY BALL: When those words open the baseball season today, fans across 
Ventura County will be rooting for hometown players who made the big leagues. 
Terry Pendleton, for one, has a loyal following in Oxnard, where he started in 
Little League at Colonia Park. . . . On occasion Pendleton returns to Channel 
Islands High School to inspire young ballplayers, said Don Cardinal, his former 
coach who recently retired. "He comes back and signs their hats and gloves and 
they really love that." 
</P>
<P>
 ALL ABOARD: The first Metrolink train pulls out of Oxnard at 5:31 this 
morning, aimed at helping relieve traffic congestion on quake-damaged freeways 
(B5). . . . In grand tradition, Oxnard leaders plan a big send-off before they 
hop the train to Moorpark and then take a shuttle bus back. Bill Davis, the 
county's Metrolink representative, warns of mistakes made by Camarillo 
politicians. "When the train stopped, I said, 'C'mon guys, let's get off the 
train.' They just kept yakking." And they missed their stop. 
</P>
<P>
 CYBER SURFING: Beginning this morning, Ventura County library patrons can take 
the information superhighway to get books from libraries as far north as Paso 
Robles. County librarians are joining a computer network that allows patrons to 
search library shelves in Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo counties and borrow 
any of their 1.1 million books. . . . Within six months, terminals at the 14 
operating branches will be able to search some data bases on the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
 BATTERY CHANGE: So you've either changed your clocks to daylight-savings time 
or you're an hour late for work. Never mind that for now. County fire officials 
have another chore for you: Change your smoke alarm batteries. . . . They say 
75% of homes have a smoke detector, but half of those don't work because of an 
old or missing battery. The "Change Your Clock, Change Your Batteries" program 
is brought to you by the Assn. of Fire Chiefs, the American Burn Assn. and the 
ever-helpful Eveready Battery Co. Major Leaguers

FAMILY OF 9 KILLED IN NATAL; MANDELA CALLS FOR PATIENCE; SOUTH AFRICA: HE 
EXPECTS TO HOLD A SUMMIT THIS WEEK WITH DE KLERK AND ZULU LEADERS ON 
PRE-ELECTION VIOLENCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Assailants posing as policemen killed a family of ANC supporters in Natal 
province, and Nelson Mandela warned Sunday that it will take time for the state 
of emergency to end the violence that threatens this month's all-race 
elections. 
</P>
<P>
 Mandela, head of the African National Congress, said he hoped a summit this 
week with President Frederik W. de Klerk and Zulu leaders would dissipate 
tension so the emergency measures could be lifted, and Natal -- which includes 
the volatile KwaZulu black homeland -- could participate in the April 26-28 
voting. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for De Klerk said the summit would take place Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The nine deaths in Port Shepstone, on Natal's south coast, and at least nine 
other killings Saturday and early Sunday brought the death toll in Natal to 37 
since De Klerk declared the state of emergency Thursday, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The attackers in Port Shepstone identified themselves as policemen to enter a 
hut on Saturday night, then hacked and stabbed nine people to death, including 
a 5-month-old infant and two older children. The family was identified as ANC 
supporters, Police Lt. Col. Marzedt de Beer said. 
</P>
<P>
 In another incident, bullets fired from an ANC-controlled area killed one 
woman and injured another as they prayed on Easter Sunday at a cross set up in 
the streets of Bhambayi, near Durban, De Beer said. 
</P>
<P>
 The attacks were part of the daily violence that has racked Natal, where the 
ANC and the Zulu nationalist Inkatha Freedom Party have fought since 1990. 
Inkatha is boycotting the election. 
</P>
<P>
 De Klerk, in conjunction with the multiracial Transitional Executive Council 
helping run the country until the vote, declared the state of emergency because 
of the escalating political violence. 
</P>
<P>
 Mandela's ANC is expected to win the election and has pledged to get rid of 
black homelands, including KwaZulu, which were established under the apartheid 
system of racial segregation. 
</P>
<P>
 Zulu nationalists led by Chief Mangosuthu Gatsha Buthelezi, the Inkatha 
Freedom Party leader, oppose the vote, fearing an ANC victory will allow it to 
crush the rights of South Africa's 7 million Zulus, most of whom live in Natal. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 1,000 South African soldiers have been sent to Natal to try to 
secure the province, especially KwaZulu, so campaigning and voting can proceed 
unhindered. 
</P>
<P>
 Mandela, who joined De Klerk and Buthelezi in kneeling together to pray for 
peace at an Easter service for 1 million adherents of the Zion Christian Church 
in Moria, in the northern Transvaal, said soldiers need time to bring violence 
under control. 
</P>
<P>
 "We shouldn't have exaggerated or unrealistic expectations," he said. "The 
security forces are busy establishing themselves, and it might take some time 
before they actually master the situation." 
</P>
<P>
 At least 290 people died in the political strife in Zulu-dominated Natal in 
March, the highest monthly total in three years. Tensions deepened last Monday 
when at least 53 people were killed in violence linked to a march by Zulu 
nationalists in Johannesburg.

NATION IN BRIEF; WASHINGTON, D.C.; CONGRESS STEPS UP FREE MASS MAILINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
From Times Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 House members stepped up their taxpayer-financed mass mailings as the 1994 
election year approached, according to a new study. In November and December, 
House members spent about $10 million to mail newsletters, cards and letters to 
constituents, the National Taxpayers Union Foundation said.That was nearly 
one-third of $33.5 million spent for the entire year. Recent restrictions, 
however, have cut the mail costs significantly. In 1991, the last non-election 
year, mass mailings in the House totaled $44.8 million. Despite the drop, 
foundation President David Keating said, "the House once again has begun a 
pre-election franking frenzy." He said mass mail sent at taxpayer expense -- 
known as franked mail -- is a subsidy for incumbents and "self-promoting 
propaganda sent to citizens who never asked for it." The foundation is a 
conservative group that analyzes congressional spending.

 Planned Parenthood begins a $10-million advertising campaign Tuesday with a 
clear message for Congress: Health reform must cover all women's medical needs, 
including contraception and abortion, or lawmakers will pay at election time. 
"For women, reproductive health care is basic health care," said Planned 
Parenthood President Pamela Maraldo."Congress must not turn its back on the 
women of America." Anti-abortion groups denounced the campaign and are asking 
lawmakers to sign pledges to oppose any plan that covers abortion. "Don't try 
to make abortion the same medical need as bone marrow transplant or open-heart 
surgery," said Janet Parshall of the conservative Concerned Women for America. 
Planned Parenthood's ads don't directly mention abortion, instead saying that 
all reproductive health care must be covered under any national health system. 
But they are meant to counter anti-abortion efforts, including $1.4 million 
that the Christian Coalition, a Pat Robertson group, spent in newspaper ads 
this winter, spokeswoman Bebe Bahnsen said.

HOMELESS BEGGAR SAVES 2 TRAPPED IN FIERY CAR

 A homeless man who was begging for quarters plunged twice into a burning car 
to rescue the two people trapped inside. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't no big deal," Michael Dennis said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was just the right thing. I saw two old people burning up. You can't just 
ignore that." 
</P>
<P>
 Dennis was begging Saturday afternoon when a car driven by Margaret Waltzer, 
67, struck a truck and a traffic signal pole and caught fire. 
</P>
<P>
 Dennis rescued her and her 79-year-old husband, Elmo. 
</P>
<P>
 They were in stable condition at Baptist-Mercy Medical Center.

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES: MODEST PROPOSAL; 
'PAY PARENTS TO BE TEACHERS' AIDES' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEL HENRICH , Oceanside 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 What do you think of an idea that would bring the family together, help 
prevent juvenile delinquency and crime, improve education, eliminate a good 
portion of welfare and help the economy by providing new jobs? 
</P>
<P>
 It's very simple.Pay one parent to become active in our educational system by 
becoming a teacher's aide and becoming responsible for his or her child's 
homework. 
</P>
<P>
 Family life has been destroyed because both parents have to work. Parental 
guidance disappears when the parents are working and are too tired to do much 
with their children when they get home after a day of hard work. Lack of 
parental supervision causes some children to join gangs and is one of the main 
reasons for the increase in violence and crime. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the basic needs of education is homework. Without any supervision there 
usually is no homework. Paying one parent to become a teacher's aide will help 
the family financially, which could eliminate the need for welfare in some 
cases. It would be more like "workfare." This income could help the family get 
out of poverty. It would also create new jobs.  
</P>
<P>
 One may ask, where are you going to get the money? From the federal government 
through our taxes. Can we afford to put a price on family welfare? We must 
realize that the cost of crime and how any crime prevention method, in the long 
run, saves money. It is time that we realize that we have to think of others 
first.

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES: MAKING A DIFFERENCE; 
ONE OBSERVATORY'S APPROACH: 'STAR PARTIES' FOR EVERYDAY PEOPLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 More than 1.8 million people each year relieve their earthbound routine with a 
visit to Los Angeles' Griffith Observatory. A handful of scientists, trained 
guides and volunteers ensure that thousands who aren't likely to get to the 
observatory still have a chance to see something of the heavens from their own 
neighborhoods. For more than 50 years Griffth Observatory astronomers and 
trained guides have been bringing portable telescopes to schools, libraries, 
parks and recreational centers to introduce stargazing to people throughout Los 
Angeles. With volunteers from local astronomy clubs supplementing the 
observatory's outreach efforts more than 20,000 people in Los Angeles and 
Orange counties look through traveling telescopes each year. Scores of people 
gather outdoors for "star parties" around the region to peer through telescopes 
while guides direct them to objects in the sky. But those who offer their 
equipment and expertise to provide access to sights millions of miles away 
sometimes pay a price. Recently, nearly $3,000 in telescope accessories 
collected for more than 20 years was stolen from one volunteer while he helped 
conduct a star party near a downtown Los Angeles library branch. WHY LOOK TO 
THE SKIES? 
</P>
<P>
 Anthony Cook 
</P>
<P>
 Griffith Observatory's Astronomical Observer 
</P>
<P>
 All of us can learn about a different way of looking at where we are in the 
universe when we look into the sky. We can learn how we're connected by seeing 
what makes it real that we're all a part of the Milky Way. 
</P>
<P>
 The traveling telescope removes astronomy and the study of the universe from 
being an academic and remote topic. We show people the excitement in the images 
of astronomy by presenting them directly. 
</P>
<P>
 I don't want to sound hackneyed about encouraging a sense of wonder about the 
skies, but often our immediate environment in the city can be depressing. We 
forget or don't realize that we're surrounded by incredible things that we can 
experience with our own eyes, like constellations and most of the planets. 
</P>
<P>
 The traveling telescope is not only for children, but for everyone and 
especially for those who can't make it up to the observatory -- seniors and 
those who might not have transportation to visit us. I've seen people who speak 
all different languages, who come from different cultural backgrounds and I've 
seen homeless people get into serious discussions about the sky. Seeing the 
moon's surface, the rings of Saturn removes believing in their existence from 
being dependent upon someone else's authority. You can verify it and test that 
truth yourself. We try to make that science real, to animate its process and to 
remove it from the idea that it's abstract drudgery. ONE NIGHT OF SIGHTS FROM 
THE SIDEWALK 
</P>
<P>
 On cloudless nights with a little astronomical knowledge and no more than a 
pair of binoculars Southern Californians can spot plenty in the sky even 
through an atmosphere fouled by urban light and smog.  
</P>
<P>
 This year the Griffith Observatory will celebrate Astronomy day April 16 from 
1:30 p.m. to 10 p.m. Observatory guides will conduct special telescope tours; 
astronomy clubs will set up additional telescopes on the observatory lawn for 
guests to look through. With binoculars, sidewalk astronomers throughout 
Southern California can spot: 
</P>
<P>
 Craters on the moon, 238,000 miles from Earth 
</P>
<P>
 Phases of Venus, 144 million miles from Earth  
</P>
<P>
 Moons of Jupiter, 414 million miles from Earth  
</P>
<P>
 Orion Nebula, gaseous star cloud 1,600 light years from Earth 
</P>
<P>
 Comet McNaught-Russell, 84 million miles from Earth TO GET INVOLVED

 For hundreds of thousands of foreign students, the United States -- with its 
superior colleges and universities -- is still the promised land. 
</P>
<P>
 And so, when two Japanese students -- Go Matsuura and Takuma Ito -- were 
gunned down in a carjacking in San Pedro last month, their deaths became more 
than two shocking murders. The young men took with them a slice of the American 
Dream.

 In today's Community Essay, writer Kinue Tokudome deplores the seemingly 
endless cycle of violence in the United States and she urges Americans to act 
immediately to get guns off their streets. 
</P>
<P>
 To help foreign students adjust to life in the United States, most colleges 
and universities offer orientation courses and counseling. Still, the culture 
shock can sometimes be extraordinary. 
</P>
<P>
 In today's Platform, students from places as diverse as Lithuania, Pakistan 
and Jamaica discuss how different their lives are here compared to home. 
</P>
<P>
 While many -- but certainly not all -- foreign students come from safer 
environments, it appears that few of them will return home as a result of the 
killings. 
</P>
<P>
 "The students I have spoken to recognize that this random quality to violence 
is part of life in the United States," says Dixon Johnson, executive director 
of the Office for International Students and Scholars at USC. "They cope very 
well considering that." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the Institute of International Education in New York reports that 
almost 440,000 foreign students were willing to cope with life in the United 
States in the 1992-1993 school year. The largest number of those, more than 
57,000, attended schools in California. 
</P>
<P>
 While there is no evidence of a mass exodus as a result of the killings of the 
Japanese students, some educators worry that the American reputation for 
violence will eventually take its toll on foreign student enrollment. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we may find students are being scared away from California because of 
a whole host of things that we're familiar with," says Robert Ericksen, 
director of International Education and Exchange at Cal State Fullerton. "This 
incident will create more reluctance. 
</P>
<P>
 "I see countries like Britain and Australia heavily recruiting foreign 
students, who may turn to those places more frequently in the future," Ericksen 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 From a practical point of view, losing foreign students means losing the 
dollars they pay for tuition. Todd Davis, director of research at the Institute 
of International Education, says about two-thirds of the foreign students 
attending schools in the United States pay full tuition. 
</P>
<P>
 "They help support our higher education in times of softening enrollment, " 
Davis says. "And they contribute to the local economy." 
</P>
<P>
 More than dollars and cents, however, educators believe foreign students 
contribute to the diverse fabric of campus life. 
</P>
<P>
 Says Dr. Richard Pedersen, director of international programs at Cal Poly 
Pomona: "Foreign students bring into a student body a knowledge about the world 
that most students would never get."

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES: COMMUNITY COMMENT; 
'GRIEVING OVER THE LOSS OF INNOCENT LIVES IS NOT ENOUGH'; WE ALL MUST ACT TO 
RID SOCIETY OF GUN VIOLENCE. WITH ENOUGH COURAGE, IT CAN BE ACHIEVED.

Japanese who lives in Torrance.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Once again, we Japanese faced the tragedy of innocent young men killed in 
America. The story is sadly familiar and comes not long after the shooting 
death in Louisiana of Yoshi Hattori. Like the two killed in San Pedro, Go 
Matsuura and Takuma Ito, Hattori was a student who had come to America full of 
hope and dreams, only to be slain by senseless violence. The words of Ito's 
parents, "Our son loved America," break our hearts. 
</P>
<P>
 Not long before the latest slayings, the courageous actions of Oskar Schindler 
were celebrated at the Academy Awards. And a story on Chiune Sugihara, a 
Japanese diplomat who saved thousands of Jewish refugees during World War II by 
issuing transit visas, appeared in the press. Wasn't the message overwhelmingly 
told in "Schindler's List": "He who saves a single life saves the entire 
world?" Yet America allows so many innocent lives to be lost in peace time. 
Didn't Sugihara choose to follow his conscience rather than orders? Yet 
Americans allow special-interest groups to keep them from doing the same.  
</P>
<P>
 America has always celebrated celebrating the courageous deeds of the past. 
But what about courage today? Steven Spielberg said in a recent interview, "We 
just can't sit back and be inactive and simply hope things are going to turn 
out all right for our children. We can't just sit by and hope the guns and 
drugs will go away." The former chairman of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, 
Leo Melamed, who was saved by Sugihara, said to me in a letter recently: "We 
owe these representatives of your civilization an incalculable debt. Their 
actions preserved a small portion of human dignity." 
</P>
<P>
 It is painfully obvious that gun violence is destroying your society. We see 
occasional displays of courage, like from those who advocate strong gun 
control. I helped the parents of Yoshi Hattori with their petition drive asking 
President Clinton to work for gun control. 
</P>
<P>
 What is needed now, however, is the awakening of an entire society. What you 
must do now -- as Oskar Schindler and Chiune Sugihara did -- is to follow your 
conscience and repay the debt you owe them for their courageous actions, which, 
after all, were taken in far more difficult situations than America faces 
today. 
</P>
<P>
 The tragedy of gun violence is human made. We should never accept it as an 
everyday part of our lives. For those of us who came from a country where there 
is very little gun violence, it is amazing how slow American lawmakers are to 
show political courage on this issue. I have lived here long enough to know 
that most Americans are deeply concerned about the proliferation of guns and 
show genuine compassion for victims of gun violence. The recent outpouring of 
emotion for the police officers killed in the South Bay and in Los Angeles were 
prime examples. I, too, wept for them. 
</P>
<P>
 But why are you so moved by the stories of Oskar Schindler and Chiune 
Sugihara? Isn't it because they acted rather than passively stood by?jGrieving 
over the loss of innocent lives is not enough. You need to act. It may take a 
generation for the United States to rid society of guns. With political 
courage, however, it can be achieved. Those who lost their lives to gun 
violence, whether they are U.S. citizens or foreigners, deserve nothing less 
than immediate action.

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES: GIVING BACK; FEELING 
LIKE A 'PRISONER IN YOUR OWN SKIN' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Dr. Adrianna Scheibner was interviewed by free-lance writer Sylvia Miller. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dr. ADRIANNA SCHEIBNER, Beverly Hills; Dr. Adrianna Scheibner is the founder 
of the Brave Hearts Foundation, which treats children who suffer physical and 
emotional trauma due to skin disfigurement. She began her practice in Australia 
in 1980 and today practices there and in Beverly Hills.  
</P>
<P>
 I began practicing medicine in Australia in 1980. In my intern year I became 
involved in doing laser treatment at Sydney Hospital with a professor who is a 
melanoma surgeon. He had the first laser in Australia. 
</P>
<P>
 I jumped at the opportunity to use the laser at that time because of what 
preceded that, which started when I was about 7. I got a severe rash all over 
my face and for two years my grandmother would take me from one dermatologist 
to another. They would poke and prod and look down at me from over their 
glasses and white coats and not treat me like a person who was scared, but like 
an interesting condition that they didn't have an answer to. And for two years 
not knowing when this was going to go away, or if it was ever going to go away, 
I really got to know what it's like, walking around like a prisoner in your own 
skin. 
</P>
<P>
 I hear this every single day that patients come in, and it doesn't matter how 
severe their problem is. Every time they look in the mirror, they automatically 
focus in on that problem and they feel caught, trapped; they feel helpless, 
hopeless. Those feelings affect their self-esteem, every walk of their life. 
It's something that other people can really underestimate. 
</P>
<P>
 Between 1980 and 1982 I developed a technique with the laser that was one of 
only two used at the time, called the Argon laser. It was producing scarring 
virtually 100% of the time in children and up to 30% in adults. Only the most 
severe port wine birthmarks were treated. In a moment of inspiration, I 
developed a technique that eliminated this scarring. I was then able to start 
treating all kinds of cosmetic conditions that were previously not treated in 
children as young as 12 months of age. 
</P>
<P>
 People in the United States and elsewhere heard about it and I came here to 
teach and decided to stay. I have three doctors working full time at my 
practice in Australia. I go there approximately twice a year to do interviews 
and to teach them new techniques. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the past two years, I have developed additional techniques to treat 
scars, which is something I am very excited about. Scars are considered 
permanent. A lot of people are treating birthmarks now, but not scars. 
Virtually any kind of scarring can be treated, which has led me to treat abused 
children, accident victims and gang members who want tattoos removed. Scars are 
a constant reminder of that original trauma, and especially if it was 
emotionally traumatic. It takes between two and four treatments for the average 
scar. Some can take more, especially if it's deep. I treated one abuse victim 
who had 262 stitches in one cut. 
</P>
<P>
 Ever since I started practicing, I've treated everybody, whether they had 
insurance or not. What's happened now is that there are so many children, and 
the costs in the United States are so high, that if I wanted to continue the 
treatments I had to put something together in a foundation. That's how Brave 
Hearts started three years ago. We're just now getting to the point where we're 
doing fund raising.  
</P>
<P>
 I came up with the name Brave Hearts because these little children have to be 
brave. Children are the only ones who are victims. Adults can ask questions. 
Children are at the mercy of all adults -- their parents, the schools, the 
teachers and the doctor. One boy I've been treating since age 12 is now 18. He 
wants to go to medical school after having gone through this. Another patient 
I've been treating is in nursing school because of having treatments. I started 
treating her when she was about 14. 
</P>
<P>
 The foundation tries to assist them with their schooling. One interesting 
thing is that a lot of these children want to be movie stars. Maybe it's a way 
for them to overcome their problem -- to go out and prove themselves to the 
world.

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES: PLATFORM; FOREIGN 
STUDENTS: 'MY HOME COUNTRY IS SAFER THAN L.A.' 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The slayings of two Japanese college students in San Pedro has set off an 
international furor. We asked the following foreign exchange students if they 
think their home country is safer than America, particularly Los Angeles and 
Southern California.  
</P>
<P>
 WU HAI-YUN 
</P>
<P>
 From Taiwan, graduate student in management information systems, West Coast 
University, Orange County 
</P>
<P>
 I feel Southern California is safer than Taiwan, unfortunately. The Taiwanese 
are living through some political changes, so a lot of things are uncertain and 
due to that uncertainty there is a lot of crime. 
</P>
<P>
 No, (I haven't been a victim of crime in either place), but I remember the 
first time I came to Los Angeles, just to get familiar with my environment, and 
some people driving (by) in a car, stopped, asked me about my name and whether 
I wanted to get married or not. (It was) kind of strange. Living in Southern 
California, one thing that really worries me is people legally holding guns. 
But other than that, as long as I go back home early and don't hang around with 
strangers, basically I feel it's safer here. NELSON LODE 
</P>
<P>
 From Brazil, sophomore in industrial engineering at USC 
</P>
<P>
 Here it's just like Sao Paulo: There are places where you can go and there are 
places where you can't. Things like carjacking happen. You just have to be 
aware of the stuff and where you are.  
</P>
<P>
 I got a little worried after I heard about the Japanese students because my 
car is the same make. I have friends who have had some problems like wallets 
stolen on the bus. But they never had an experience like that. NEMIRA 
MACHIANSKIENE 
</P>
<P>
 From Lithuania, graduate student in education at Cal State Northridge 
</P>
<P>
 I think Lithuania is a bit safer. We feel safer, maybe because we are a 
smaller country. You can walk freely to the shops and movie theaters at night 
and you are sure that no one will shoot at you without any reason. They may 
steal something from you; there are a lot of pickpockets, but not (killings). I 
think that the cruelty that's shown on TV has something to do with the cruelty 
of people, especially children. They see cruelty in TV movies and see death as 
fun, so they seek the same "fun" in real life. MICHAEL MILLER 
</P>
<P>
 From Jamaica, graduate student in religion at Claremont Graduate School 
</P>
<P>
 I grew up in rural Jamaica, which had very little crime. People looked out for 
each other quite a bit. As with everywhere else though, crime is on the 
increase in my own country. And crime with the gun is also on the increase 
there, especially in Kingston. But there are crimes like the hijacking of cars 
in L.A. that I don't recall hearing of when I was at home. I live in Claremont 
and Claremont is fairly peaceful. I have not come close to being violently 
victimized. But we hear from Pomona and other places of a lot of violent 
things. About the city of Los Angeles you hear these things and it sounds 
dangerous. But I know people who live in the city and don't feel extreme fear. 
MONIKA BARTESCH 
</P>
<P>
 From Germany, sophomore in English literature at Occidental College 
</P>
<P>
 I must say I feel safe here; but I won't go out in the evening by myself 
because people have told me that it's very dangerous. In Germany it's probably 
not as dangerous, but after the unification, violence is increasing there too. 
TAUSEEF KAZI 
</P>
<P>
 From Pakistan, graduate student in computer engineering at USC 
</P>
<P>
 As far as L.A. is concerned, especially the region where I live -- Downtown -- 
it is definitely not safer than Karachi. There is no place in Karachi that I 
know of where you cannot go at night, where you cannot leave your car without 
an attendant. It will still be there when you come back. But there are places 
here where you can't go at night.  
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand the police here are much more efficient than we have back 
home. You can call the police and they come to your help pretty quickly. JAMES 
LIN 
</P>
<P>
 From China, in MBA program at Cal State Northridge 
</P>
<P>
 Compared to Los Angeles, my country is safer. The lifestyle there is simpler. 
Usually, we go to work and go back home. We don't have that much outside 
activity. It's very family oriented. 
</P>
<P>
 I've been a crime victim here twice. The first time when I was working in a 
small shop at night and somebody came in and asked me to open the register. I 
was about to give him the money -- it's not as important as your life -- but I 
was so shocked my reaction was probably a little bit slower than what he 
expected so he grabbed me and tried to pull me over the counter. Mentally, I 
got scared and I was physically injured. The second time, I parked my car near 
the campus and somebody tried to steal it. I've been here more than two years 
and I'm being more cautious when I go out. ARTHUR TABUENA 
</P>
<P>
 From the Philippines, MBA student in finance at Claremont Graduate School 
</P>
<P>
 Definitely, I feel safer back home because I know the safe places and I know 
the places I should avoid. If I'm in California as a tourist maybe it would 
help to be a little more picky about the places that I would want to visit. 
Maybe before you come to Southern California you could read more about it and 
learn the do's and don'ts. Newspapers could probably give you an initial 
perception of what's happening, but take another step: Ask the travel agencies 
or whatever. SOENKE ZEHLE 
</P>
<P>
 From Germany, junior studying English literature at Occidental College 
</P>
<P>
 I don't feel unsafe in either place. One thing I've noticed is that the 
differences between neighborhoods are not as extreme in Germany as they are 
here. We don't really have distinct neighborhoods and the inner cities are kind 
of what the suburbs are here so that never really posed a problem. 
</P>
<P>
 I explored Los Angeles by bike last summer and I love to go to the beach by 
bike and that never turned out to be a problem either. So I was taken by 
surprise by the news about the Japanese students because I never felt that 
threatened by the city. 
</P>
<P>
 What is unsettling, of course, is that even on campus the level of security is 
relatively high. There's a lot of stuff that always seems to happen other 
people, but never to me and the people I know. 
</P>
<P>
 I read about things and hear about things; but they don't seem to match with 
what I experience myself. The feeling of security (or lack of it) doesn't 
really correspond with the actual situation.

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES: GRIPE; PHONE MAZE 
HAS A HOLLOW RING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BERNARD J. WOLFSON, Los Angeles 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Last week, I dialed my voice mail message center to see if anybody had tried 
to reach me while I was away from the house. A recording informed me that the 
phone company's voice mail system was temporarily out of order and messages 
were not being transmitted. I called the telephone company's repair office to 
find out what the problem was. 
</P>
<P>
 "Welcome to the repair center," a very pleasant female voice greeted me. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hello. I am wondering if you can tell me -- " 
</P>
<P>
 She cut me off: "If you need help using your system, please press one." 
</P>
<P>
 I felt foolish. Just imagine: I had actually taken her for a real person. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you would like to make a change in your service or report upcoming travel, 
please press two. If you would like to order a new service, please press 
three," the voice, sounding less pleasant now, droned on. 
</P>
<P>
 I had no choice but to wade through the options, hoping to hear one that would 
come close to what I needed. After the fifth or sixth choice, the voice 
promised that if I stayed on the line, I would be connected with a human being. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon, to my great relief, I heard clicking sounds and a phone began to ring. 
It rang about 20 times. Finally, another recorded voice informed me that all 
representatives were "temporarily busy." 
</P>
<P>
 If I stayed on the line, the voice promised, someone would be with me shortly. 
After what seemed like an eternity, the phone rang again. This time, the 
ringing ended abruptly, replaced by a busy signal. I had run into a brick wall. 
I was forced to hang up and start over at the beginning of the automated 
digital maze. 
</P>
<P>
 After 15 minutes, a male voice answered. It seemed human, but I wasn't sure. 
"Are you a real person or a recording?" 
</P>
<P>
 He thought about it for a moment. 
</P>
<P>
 That was just one of many similar telephone experiences I have had since 
returning to the United States after five years abroad. What has happened here? 
Why is it so hard for one human being to talk to another about relatively 
straightforward business matters? 
</P>
<P>
 In Paris, where I lived for three years, I often lost my way in the telephone 
labyrinths of numerous bureaucracies. But every step of the way, I found 
warm-bodied, breathing humans on the other end of the line. They most often 
breathed fire, but at least they were real. I had a chance to explain what I 
needed. 
</P>
<P>
 It seems to me that this trend toward automation is symptomatic of a more 
generalized depersonalization of our society. We have all become numbers rather 
than personalities. To the Pacific Bell operator who finally answered me, I was 
caller No. 5 or 10 or 100. To universities, hospitals and insurance companies, 
I am a Social Security number. To credit card companies, I am their account 
number. 
</P>
<P>
 As demand for information, goods and services spirals, an efficient way must 
evolve to ensure that things run smoothly. That requires a degree of 
standardization, which, in turn, increases anonymity. But at what cost to our 
souls? Could we be experiencing some cruel corollary of supply and demand 
theory -- that an oversupply of human beings has led to a sharp reduction in 
the value of each individual?

CALARTS: A SCHOOL GOES TO SCHOOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The California Institute for the Arts, CalArts, is housed in a 
550,000-square-foot facility on a Valencia hilltop. Founded in 1961 by Walt 
Disney, CalArts has a world reputation in animation and in such ultra-high-tech 
arts as interactive video.  
</P>
<P>
 Enter the Northridge earthquake. As President Steven D. Lavine said in a 
recent letter to supporters, "everything that could break broke." Wiring was 
ripped out of sound-mixing equipment as complex as a jet plane cockpit. 
Everywhere, wreckage. 
</P>
<P>
 And then the real blow fell. Two weeks after the earthquake, seismic experts 
reported that the main building -- the basket in which CalArts had all its 
fragile, electronic eggs -- was damaged badly and could not be returned to full 
service for months. A space of more than half a million square feet, and not 
just any kind of space: ultra-customized, high-tech space. It seemed nothing 
could begin to replace it.  
</P>
<P>
 As it happened, however, just up Interstate 5 from CalArts' hilltop, Lockheed 
had a small industrial park standing, post-Cold War, almost empty. At a moment 
when every hour counted, Daniel M. Tellep, CEO of the aerospace giant, took 
just eight hours to decide that CalArts could move into 160,000 square feet of 
Lockheed space rent-free. The Getty Foundation, with equal speed, came up with 
$2 million to cover short-term moving costs. Here was an almost miraculous life 
preserver, but could it be seized? 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier, faculty members had moved their own and even their students' files, 
equipment and work-in-progress out of the damaged main building and into tents. 
From the tents, the stuff was now moved into the Lockheed buildings and into an 
acre or two of trailers. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, word was getting out into a community, artistic and otherwise, that 
treasured this small but unique institution and didn't want to lose it. 
</P>
<P>
 Magic Mountain, a neighbor, gave CalArts theater students free weekday use of 
its Magic Lantern theater. The Museum of Contemporary Art lent space in the 
Temporary Contemporary in Los Angeles for student art shows. Congregation Beth 
Shalom in Santa Clarita took in the music students. The list of rescuers has a 
score of such entries. CalArts, having sent its students as arts emissaries 
into the community, found its bridges busy with traffic running the other way. 
</P>
<P>

 The greatest misrepresentation in Azerbaijani Ambassador Hafiz Pashayev's 
distortion-laden letter (March 19), was his accusation that the pursuit of a 
"Greater Armenia" is why Armenians captured Azeri territory outside of 
Nagorno-Karabakh. The truth is, it was from those surrounding territories that 
Azeri troops were raining death and destruction on Karabakh's civilian Armenian 
population.It was for self-defense that Karabakh forces were compelled to 
capture those territories. And it is for sheer survival that the severely 
outnumbered Armenians are now exerting a desperate effort to fend off renewed 
attacks by a foreign-trained Azeri army, which includes Afghan mercenaries from 
the camp of the violently anti-American Muslim fundamentalist Gulbuddin 
Hekmatyar. 
</P>
<P>
 Pashayev also complains that Congress has imposed "a ban on direct aid" to 
Azerbaijan, "even for refugees." Those unfortunate Azeri refugees certainly 
deserve sympathy from all of us, but are refugees the main concern of the Azeri 
ambassador? Or does he want Congress to lift the ban so his government can have 
extra American money in order to hire more anti-American mercenaries?

GROWTH HORMONE AND MILK

<TEXT>
<P>
 Re "A Needless New Risk of Breast Cancer," Commentary, March 20: 
</P>
<P>
 It was an egregious disservice to all consumers, and especially to women 
concerned about breast cancer, for The Times to have provided a forum for 
Samuel S. Epstein's widely rejected attacks on the safety of bovine 
somatotropin (BST). 
</P>
<P>
 Epstein has so little credibility in the cancer research community that its 
major scientific organizations tire of responding to his many charges. Prompted 
by his most recent statements on BST, the American Cancer Society recently 
issued a statement declaring: "Extensive testing and research has shown that 
rBST is indistinguishable from natural bovine growth hormone and thus entails 
no risk for consumers. There are no valid scientific findings to indicate a 
risk of human carcinogenesis." 
</P>
<P>
 In a written response to Epstein, the Food and Drug Administration was equally 
direct: "Claims that IGF-1 in milk could result in premature development of 
breasts in young children and breast cancer in adults are not only not 
substantiated in the scientific literature, but, in fact, have no basis in 
science." 
</P>
<P>
 The harmless but scary-sounding insulin-growth factor (IGF-1) Epstein refers 
to is simply a medical term for a protein that is naturally found in cow's 
milk, human milk, and saliva and other human body fluids. (All milk contains 
several natural, safe and completely digestible hormones.) But more to the 
point, the FDA has concluded from detailed studies that IGF-1 is not increased. 
</P>
<P>
 In short, neither BST nor IGF-1 poses any breast cancer health risk. But in 
printing Epstein's latest pseudoscientific charge, The Times has caused untold 
scores of women to mistakenly believe something is dangerously wrong with their 
milk. The "needless new risk," as your paper titled the article, isn't BST or 
IGF-1 -- it's the misinformation printed by newspapers that are either 
unwilling or unable to determine the veracity of the facts they provide their 
readers.

REFORM, YES, BUT DON'T NAIL THE DOORS SHUT; SOME INS PROPOSALS MIGHT BLOCK 
LEGITIMATE ASYLUM SEEKERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As part of its effort to get better control of immigration to the United 
States, the Clinton Administration has proposed changes in the way this country 
grants asylum to refugees from foreign countries. Modifications in the asylum 
system clearly are needed because of recent abuses and bureaucratic problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Under U.S. immigration law, refugees are defined as those who flee their 
homelands because of a legitimate fear of persecution, for political, religious 
or other reasons. Balanced against the hundreds of thousands of immigrants who 
legally enter the country each year, not to mention the millions who try to get 
in illegally, the number of refugees seeking asylum is comparatively small. In 
fiscal 1993, for example, only slightly more than 150,000 asylum applications 
were submitted to the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service. However, 
that relatively modest number is deceptive; it is nearly triple the 56,000 
asylum applications filed in 1991. Only 35,000 of the 1993 asylum applications 
were processed. The rest became part of a backlog of more than 370,000 asylum 
cases awaiting INS action. 
</P>
<P>
 That backlog has, unfortunately, made it easy for some illegal immigrants, and 
the sophisticated smugglers who bring them into the country, to manipulate the 
asylum system to their benefit. They file fraudulent claims, fully expecting 
them to be rejected in the 18 months to two years it will take to process them. 
But in the meantime the applicant is free to live and work in the United 
States. Such cynical manipulation of the system works to the detriment of many 
thousands of legitimate refugees.  
</P>
<P>
 In an effort to speed the asylum process, and also weed out fraudulent claims 
faster, INS Commissioner Doris Meissner has asked Congress for $64 million in 
the coming year to more than double the number of immigration officers, from 
150 to 334, assigned to handle the INS' burgeoning asylum caseload. The INS' 
parent agency, the Justice Department, would at the same time double the number 
of immigration judges who hear asylum cases, from 85 to 170. We agree with INS 
officials and refugee advocates who say this would improve the system. 
</P>
<P>
 But INS and refugee advocates part ways on two regulations Meissner has 
proposed to discourage fraudulent claims: a $130 fee that all would-be refugees 
would have to pay to file for asylum and a 180-day wait before work permits can 
be issued to those seeking asylum -- double the current 90 days. Refugee 
advocates warn that both would cause severe hardship for legitimate refugees. 
That may be a valid concern, especially in the case of refugees from places 
like Haiti, where political violence is rampant and many of the people fleeing 
are poor peasants. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Meissner makes a valid point in arguing that it is "only fair" that 
refugees pay a small part of what it costs to process their application. In 
addition, the fee can be waived.  
</P>
<P>
 As for work permits, Meissner argues that once the asylum process is speeded 
up, legitimate refugees will have their claims processed sooner and won't have 
to wait the full 180 days to work legally. We hope she is right, but she must 
be prepared to modify that rule, too, if it causes hardship. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, Meissner's asylum reforms are reasonable and worth trying. The 
honorable tradition of giving asylum to genuine refugees is too important to 
jeopardize by allowing abuse of the system to continue.

WHITEWATER CONTROVERSY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Clearly Congress needs to pass a law exempting presidents, while in office, 
from the governmental investigation or prosecution of any matter other than 
malfeasance in current office. A federal law could extend the statute of 
limitations on other actions until the end of the final presidential term. 
</P>
<P>
 The executive branch is being seriously damaged by politically motivated 
investigations. Soon only a living saint will be able to function in office and 
I am not convinced that such a holy man would be in the country's best 
interests.

 Investigating the Whitewater affair at this point is a clear case of 
sandbagging after the flood. However, now that Congress is in such a virtuous 
mood, it might be a good time to suggest a way to prevent future indiscretions 
of this nature. 
</P>
<P>
 Quite simply, a law should be passed that all elected officials get their 
taxes audited every year. Not only would it help to keep politicians in line, 
it may raise a good deal of revenue. How about it, Sen. Dole?

 In your editorial of March 28 you ask, "Is it reasonable to establish a set of 
ethical expectations for our politicians that rises along with their 
prominence, thus setting up a situation in which the bombshell explodes only at 
the point at which it is most damaging to the country?" My answer as a citizen 
voter uncommitted politically is a resounding yes! It is not only reasonable 
but essential to have leaders of moral fiber. Not considering here the issue of 
having to trust them nor the effect of leadership role models on the rest of 
us, to tolerate and accept less from national leaders is a sure route to the 
disruption caused by certain exposure of their wrongdoing. I, as a citizen of 
our beloved country, will continue to expect honesty for my vote.

 The Times reported on Republican Rep. Jim Leach's charges on the House floor 
against President and Mrs. Clinton's dealing with their Whitewater investment 
(March 25). Leach's extensive charges came after a months-long investigation 
and then he admitted that the evidence does not directly tie Clinton to any 
wrongdoing. He then acknowledged that "on the landscape of political scandals" 
Whitewater may end up being only "a bump." 
</P>
<P>
 Then why do the Republicans keep insisting that there is any need for 
congressional hearings? The Republicans are trying their best to turn this bump 
in the political road into a Watergate/Iran-Contra mountain. This is ample 
indication that the President's opponents have little else to offer than 
tabloid-style politics at a time when we need serious plans to direct the 
country on the path to prosperity and justice.

 Regarding the March 24 "press conference," which was centered on the

suppose this scenario should be preserved in some form for the next clinic on 
"our hard-hitting press at work." What a marshmallow toss!

 Robert McFarlane (Commentary, March 23) suggested that President Clinton and 
Sen. Bob Dole get together and agree to discontinue Whitewater hearings if 
Clinton will publicly come clean. He cites the example of President Eisenhower, 
Sen. Lyndon Johnson and Speaker Sam Rayburn. The problem with this is that 
Eisenhower, unlike Clinton, was elected by an overwhelming majority, never told 
a lie and was a war hero rather than an embarrassment to the military. 
</P>
<P>
 We have elected a President based on promises (turn the economy around, reform 
health care, etc.) instead of character, stature and honor. If Clinton went " . 
. . before the people and (laid) everything out," who would believe him after a 
history of constant dissembling?

 Can Clinton pardon everyone associated with Whitewater for any possible crimes

George Bush did? Of course we would miss the spectacle of Congress embarrassing 
itself in hearings and destroying any possibility of criminal indictments.

 Congratulations to Hillary Clinton for her astute business sense and ability

30). Do I detect a hint of envy? Look up investment in the dictionary and learn 
not only that profitability is a goal, investing is a key element of our 
free-market economy. 
</P>

 Had Hillary significant losses, her detractors would be quick to imply she was 
squandering hard-earned family "milk money." This Republican is liking Ms.

NEW DIET FOR THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT; GOODBY TO THE BOARD OF TEA EXPERTS AS 
CLINTON SHRINKS AGENCY STAFFS AND ADVISORY PANELS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton pledged last year to squeeze some of the fat out of 
government and drive down the paralyzing deficits. He is beginning to make good 
on that promise. 
</P>
<P>
 The White House has eliminated more than a quarter of the 800 discretionary 
advisory boards, including many honorary, powerless and unnecessary committees 
not mandated by law. And, on Wednesday, Clinton signed legislation that will 
downsize the federal government, saving an estimated $22 billion over five 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 The Federal Workforce Restructuring Act of 1994 requires reductions of 272,900 
employees before the end of 1999. To ease the need for layoffs, the new law 
allows departments and agencies to offer buyouts of up to $25,000 in a lump sum 
determined by an employee's age and length of service, plus severance pay based 
solely on tenure. This incentive should encourage more senior and better-paid 
employees to leave government service, without robbing agencies and departments 
of younger and cheaper workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on Vice President Al Gore's vision of a more efficient federal work 
force, the law will reduce the federal government to fewer than 2 million 
workers, the lowest level since 1966. The Clinton Administration insists the 
cutbacks will make government cost less. That's a given. The White House also 
believes the reductions will make government work better. That remains to be 
seen. 
</P>
<P>
 In the austerity move aimed at the federal advisory committees, the White 
House has abolished 284 of the panels, set up to give guidance to various 
departments and agencies. A saving of about $17 million is expected to result 
from elimination of annual allowances, per diem stipends, staff support, 
overhead and travel. 
</P>
<P>
 These committees allow citizens, who are appointed, and in at least a few 
cases politically well-connected, to contribute to federal deliberations or 
lend their expertise to departments such as Health and Human Services on 
complex subjects. Some panels, such as the committees that recommend a new 
drug, are valuable; others are superfluous. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the White House made the cuts, 28,000 Americans served on these boards. 
Some of the federal bodies were obviously and painfully obsolete. The 
eliminated panels include the Board of Tea Experts, established in 1897 to 
inspect and taste imported tea, the Advisory Panel on Dictionary of 
Occupational Titles, the Advisory Panel for Political Scientists and the Civil 
War Sites Advisory Committee. The government really didn't need all those 
private advisers on an on-going basis. 
</P>
<P>
 Belt-tightening is never without pain. These reductions are a start -- but 
only a start -- toward ratcheting down Washington's huge deficits.

BIAS AGAINST ANY RACE IS UNACCEPTABLE; LOS ANGELES: THE EXCLUSION OF 5,000 
WHITE APPLICANTS FROM A FIREFIGHTER TEST SHOWS HOW GOOD INTENTIONS CAN GO AWRY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHELLE EUN JOO PARK-STEEL, Michelle Eun Joo Park-Steel is a member of the 
Los Angeles Fire Commission. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Because of their skin color, "white," 5,000 applicants were prohibited from 
taking the firefighter exam in February. 
</P>
<P>
 The genesis of this Draconian remedy is a 1974 consent decree between the city 
of Los Angeles and the Justice Department. The decree's interim and long-range 
goals effectively required the Fire Department to hire 50% of its firefighters 
from minorities. Since then, significant change has taken place. The percentage 
of Caucasian firefighters has been reduced from 93% to 67%. Fortunately, the 
decree never compromised on the qualifications of a firefighter. Regardless of 
the race of the individual, it is still current law and practice to hire the 
best-qualified individuals. 
</P>
<P>
 However, it seems that the screening of potential applicants has gotten bogged 
down in a bureaucratic maze. In this case, Los Angeles was burdened with the 
racial exclusion of 5,000 individuals who waited in good faith for years to 
take the exam. 
</P>
<P>
 Discrimination is against the fundamental values of the American culture. It 
was wrong in the Jim Crow era and it is wrong 100 years later. 
</P>
<P>
 Some questions trouble me. What is a "minority"? For example, Los Angeles has 
changed demographically in the last 20 years. We have many new citizens who do 
not fit neatly into the traditional minority role. 
</P>
<P>
 I asked a city personnel official if newly immigrated Iranian Americans are 
considered a minority and was told they are considered Caucasian. I was 
informed that Arab Americans are considered Caucasians, as well as people from 
India. It seems that traditional definitions are no longer appropriate. 
Moreover, what about my children? I asked how they should apply. I was told my 
Euro-Asian children should claim they are Asian to fit the goals. 
</P>
<P>
 California now produces more interracial marriages than any other state. With 
the inevitable growth of mixed racial groups, the American melting pot 
continues to transform our culture. At the same time, holding onto stereotype 
images of mono-racial groups, whose numbers are declining, means that racial 
quotas become arbitrary and are ultimately useless. 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone recognizes the importance of encouraging minority races to get a fair 
opportunity to become firefighters. But in the hands of bureaucracy, this 
process can become a horror show by creating a new level of racial exclusion. 
</P>
<P>
 In order to maintain the quality of one of the most effective fire departments 
in the world, I support the following alternatives that would address the 
concerns of increased minority participation but protect the quality of 
firefighting personnel. 
</P>
<P>
 First, any applicant should be allowed to take the examination and not be 
denied that right on grounds of race. Allowing all individuals to take the 
firefighter exam will still afford sufficient numbers of individuals in the 
minority races to meet the 50/50 goal of the consent decree. 
</P>
<P>
 Second, the examination should take place on a regular basis; the last test 
was four years ago. Applicants should be given the opportunity to take the test 
at least every six months. It is unfair for potential applicants to have to 
wait years, not knowing when or if they can take the examination. It is 
especially unfair if someone waits years to take the examination, only to be 
informed that he is not permitted to take the test because of the color of his 
skin. 
</P>
<P>
 The election of Mayor Riordan provided a new sense of direction, hope and 
energy for Los Angeles. The old policies of rigid goals are insensitive to 
current legitimate goals of all citizens. Hostility toward any race is no 
longer acceptable. If Los Angeles is to become safer and more prosperous, it 
must establish a world-class attitude that gives everyone an equal opportunity 
to serve our city.

 I'm a sucker for serial killers. So when I learned a few weeks ago that 
Jeffrey Dahmer was going to be interviewed on "Dateline NBC" I couldn't resist 
tuning in. I expected to be titillated by gory madness. I didn't expect to 
understand. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dateline" is a '90's news-melodrama with movie music and a cleft-chinned 
baritone host, Stone Phillips, to make us feel comfortable. As a prologue to 
his visit to the prison, Phillips spoke with Dahmer's dad, Lionel Dahmer, who 
is hawking his book, "A Father's Story," in which he searches his 
fundamentalist Christian soul for what could have gone wrong in his normal, 
happy household. We know Lionel's not just a cheesy parent making a buck off 
the misery of others, because he has promised to give "a portion" of the 
profits to the families of Jeff's victims. What altruistic thing he does with 
the remainder we can only guess. 
</P>
<P>
 After a glowing product-shot of the book, Lionel Dahmer did some dramatic 
readings interspersed with a travelogue of his son's childhood haunts. Then he 
showed home movies Never Before Seen On Television, and wondered (for our 
benefit) how that gawky boy on the screen became a ghoul. He fretted that he 
might have overlooked early warning signs: the time little Jeff jingled the 
bones of some dead animals in a bucket; the habit Jeff had of sulking in the 
woods alone, whenever Lionel and his wife were shoving and screaming at one 
another. The child, he could now see, had been shy, weak and alienated. 
</P>
<P>
 I thought back. When I was a kid, I was entranced by bones; they seemed so 
honest. Even though I had loving parents who never screamed at each other, I 
still managed to feel shy, weak and alienated. It seems to me that's a big part 
of being a kid. I suppose that's why I spent a lot of time playing gunslingers, 
the guys who could always get what they wanted. What I always wanted was 
beauty: The prize horse, the ranch with the stream through it, the dance-hall 
belle. In my back yard, I shot many a man for beauty. 
</P>
<P>
 When I grew up, I realized that beauty was still hard to get, but that adults 
who wanted Jennifer Jason Leigh or Mel Gibson as a love-slave had an 
alternative to kidnaping at gunpoint. They could go to movies like "The 
Hitcher" and "Lethal Weapon" and harmlessly fantasize about Jennifer strung up 
between two trucks, or Mel hung from meat hooks and prodded with jolts of 
electricity. As grown-ups they could still play in the back yard. 
</P>
<P>
 But Dahmer did what he should have dreamed. He stalked the best-looking 
victims he could find, invited them home for drinks and kept them with him for 
always, even if that meant just keeping a piece. 
</P>
<P>
 One day when he was driving home, Dahmer gave a lift to a hitchhiker. I've 
done that. He saw beauty and wanted it in his power, utterly, as only a 
well-placed blow to the head can deliver. OK, I confess, I've wanted that as 
well -- but I chose not to pick up a sawed-off baseball bat and make my wish 
come true. That's why I can drive to the beach whenever I feel like it, while 
Dahmer has to live in a prison and talk to Stone Phillips. 
</P>
<P>
 Sitting beside his father in a cement-block room, Jeffrey Dahmer answered 
Phillips' questions about his crimes and his sexuality. He spoke reflectively, 
as a monster who knows he is a monster but thinks his fall from dreamer to 
demon might be instructive to others. Toward the end of the interview, Phillips 
asked whether Dahmer thought family problems caused his obsession. In a decade 
when criminals cloak guilt with victimhood, Dahmer's answer was strangely 
frank. "I feel it's wrong for people who commit crimes to try to shift the 
blame on to somebody else, onto their parents, or onto their upbringing or 
living circumstances. I think that's just a cop-out. I take full 
responsibility." 
</P>
<P>
 They say that when Dahmer walks through prison, his fellow inmates go silent. 
I can understand that. I felt it, too, even sitting before the television in my 
living room. There is about him a quiet and dreadful honesty. His darkest 
secrets are public entertainment. He is one of the few among us with nothing 
left to hide.

PERSPECTIVE ON MEDICINE; THE PROFIT MOTIVE IN BREAST CANCER; RESEARCH FOCUSES 
ON HIGH-TECH AND ON DRUGS THAT PRODUCE REVENUES FOR INDUSTRIES THAT SUPPORT 
RESEARCH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY KLEIN and MICHAEL CASTLEMAN, Jeffrey Klein is editor in chief and 
Michael Castleman is medical investigative reporter for Mother Jones magazine, 
which devotes its latest issue to breast cancer politics. Both men's wives are 
breast cancer survivors. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 News stories published in the past several days have given women worried about 
breast cancer three new reasons to feel nervous. Revelations of research fraud, 
"discrepancies" and an ensuing cover-up have cast doubts on a study concluding 
that lumpectomy is as effective as radical mastectomy in the treatment of 
early-stage breast tumors. Another report revealed that the breast cancer 
treatment drug tamoxifen causes three times as many uterine cancers as 
researchers had previously suspected. Finally, five female U.S. senators 
blasted the National Cancer Institute's decision to stop recommending screening 
mammograms to women under age 50. These three developments have left millions 
of women thoroughly confused about what's best for their health. 
</P>
<P>
 The lumpectomy research question seems to be the one most easily resolved. Any 
researcher who falsified data should be punished. The administrator of the 
international breast cancer study has already been removed. But the bottom line 
is that the relatively small amount of discovered fraud shouldn't affect the 
study's conclusion, that lumpectomy with radiation has a survival rate as good 
as mastectomy. 
</P>
<P>
 The other stories, though they got less news coverage, raise warning flags 
about the cancer Establishment's willingness to endanger women. First, 
mammography: 
</P>
<P>
 It's one thing to irradiate cancerous breast tissue to treat the disease, but 
quite another to do so in the name of early detection. Health physicists 
generally agree that there is no safe level of radiation, and that even today's 
low-dose screening mammograms pose some cancer risk. In women over 50, 
available studies show that the benefit clearly outweighs the hazard, but in 
younger women the situation is less clear. While the five senators who urged 
the National Cancer Institute to reconsider its change of policy clearly want 
women to have the best health care available, their anger may be misdirected. 
If the institute is correct, then screening mammograms for asymptomatic women 
under 50 should go the way of the periodic chest X-ray, once touted for early 
detection of lung cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 The tamoxifen revelation raises equally disturbing questions. Researchers know 
that the drug helps prevent the recurrence of breast cancer in women who have 
been treated for the disease. But they are now testing the drug on women who 
have never had breast cancer but are considered "at high risk" for the disease, 
to determine whether it works for prevention. Researchers have stopped 
enrolling new participants. But they continue to give a potentially hazardous 
drug to about 10,000 women already in the study. 
</P>
<P>
 Both tamoxifen and mammography spring from a research mind-set that favors 
high-tech treatment. Both were developed by wealthy industries that have close 
ties to the major cancer organizations and help finance most public awareness 
campaigns. In fact, the cancer institute's initial support of screening 
mammography for premenopausal women may fundamentally have been driven by an 
oversupply of mammography machines. 
</P>
<P>
 The processes that drive medical research toward expensive treatments also 
turn it away from preventive measures that do not hold the promise of corporate 
profit. For example, several recent studies suggest that the organochlorine 
family of chemicals (among them the pesticide DDT and the industrial pollutants 
dioxin and the PCBs) may contribute to breast cancer. Yet the relationship 
between these environmental toxins and breast cancer continues to receive scant 
attention from the research community. 
</P>
<P>
 Where they tend toward unquestioning belief when it comes to the efficacy of 
high-tech cancer treatment, many industry and government researchers suddenly 
turn skeptical when presented with evidence of the environmental causes of 
cancer. This is why $68 million of public money is being spent to determine 
whether tamoxifen may prevent breast cancer, while only a small fraction of 
that amount is directed to research analyzing environmental clues. 
</P>
<P>
 Industry is leading us down a self-serving road in environmental and medical 
research. More public money needs to go instead to research on the underlying 
causes of increasing rates of breast and other cancers. 
</P>
<P>
 What factors in our air, water and food turn on our bodies' cancer-causing 
genes? What steps can we take to avoid becoming cancer patients in need of 
high-tech treatment? To answer these questions, the research community will 
have to gain some distance from both corporations that profit from the cancer 
business and those that produce environmental toxins. Often they are the very 
same corporations.

BETTY FURNESS; AD STAR, CONSUMER ADVOCATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MYRNA OLIVER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Betty Furness, actress, pioneering pitchwoman and consumer ombudsman on 
television and for various government agencies, has died. She was 78. 
</P>
<P>
 Miss Furness, who had suffered from stomach cancer for four years, died 
Saturday at Sloan-Kettering Memorial Hospital in New York, said her husband, 
Leslie Midgley. 
</P>
<P>
 Intrigued by politics as much as consumer advocacy, Miss Furness was named 
special assistant to the president for consumer affairs by President Lyndon B. 
Johnson in 1967. Despite criticism that her only consumer experience was 
touting refrigerators and vacuum cleaners for Westinghouse, she earned respect 
from consumer organizations for her strong stand on credit regulation, federal 
meat inspection and hidden interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was hostility, especially at first when I used to speak before business 
groups," she told The Times in 1976. "It bothered me, because as a performer I 
had always worked to applause. But then I came to the conclusion that their 
reaction meant that I was doing something right. So the hostility became a 
compliment." 
</P>
<P>
 After her work with the Johnson Administration, Miss Furness served as 
executive director of the New York State Consumer Protection Board and after 
that was named commissioner of the New York City Department of Consumer 
Affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the most recognized of government officials, Miss Furness was a fixture 
on television from its earliest days. When commercials were complex live 
productions, she demonstrated Westinghouse appliances from 1949 to 1960, ending 
every spot with her confident "You can be sure if it's Westinghouse." 
</P>
<P>
 She ventured into a different area of television consumerism late in her 
career, as a consumer reporter for NBC's "Today" show from 1976 to 1992, first 
dealing with consumer complaints and later conducting investigations. During 
the turbulent summer of 1976 in the aftermath of Barbara Walters' storied leap 
from NBC to ABC, Miss Furness also worked as co-host of "Today" and was 
seriously considered as Walters' replacement. 
</P>
<P>
 "She pioneered consumer TV news reporting, and she pursued it with 
intelligence, inquisitiveness and irrepressibility," consumer advocate Ralph 
Nader said when Miss Furness left the network in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Born to privilege in New York City, Elizabeth Mary (Betty) Furness grew up on 
Park Avenue and attended the Brearley School in New York City and Bennett 
Junior College in Millbrook, N.Y. When she was 14, at the height of the 
Depression, Miss Furness' father urged her to do "something useful." She worked 
for two summers modeling for the John Robert Powers agency, earning a total of 
$80. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency arranged a screen test for her at RKO, and at 16 she was off to 
Hollywood, where she made 35 movies over six years. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were appalling," she said years later, "except for two -- 'Swing Time' 
with Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers, and the first 'Magnificent Obsession' 
film." 
</P>
<P>
 Attracted to the stage, Miss Furness won a part in director Stella Adler's 
West Coast production of "Golden Boy" in 1937. She spent the next decade in 
summer stock and road companies in such plays as "My Sister Eileen" and 
"Doughgirls." 
</P>
<P>
 But failing to achieve major success on stage, Miss Furness returned to New 
York in 1948 to try the developing medium of television. Her first venture was 
a 15-minute show called "Fashions, Coming and Becoming." She did the narration 
and the commercials for $50 a show. 
</P>
<P>
 Westinghouse officials approached her after she had a small role in "Studio 
One," and by 1950 she was earning $100,000 a year opening refrigerator doors on 
live television. 
</P>
<P>
 She became a national folk heroine when Westinghouse sponsored the first 
telecast of a national political convention in 1952. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who's winning, Pop?" a character asked in an Indianapolis News political 
cartoon, demonstrating her instant celebrity. "Taft? Ike? Or Betty Furness?" 
</P>
<P>
 Her work at political conventions in 1952, 1956 and 1960 sparked her interest 
in politics and public affairs. Leaving Westinghouse when the new filming of 
commercials dulled her interest in the work, she went on to moderate a local 
New York television panel show, "At Your Beck and Call." 
</P>
<P>
 In the early 1960s, Miss Furness hosted a CBS radio show, "A Woman's World," 
and a WABC-TV daily panel program, "Answering Service," which was nominated for 
an Emmy. 
</P>
<P>
 She met President and Lady Bird Johnson while working for Citizens for Johnson 
and Humphrey in 1964. After the election, she toured the country for Mrs. 
Johnson, appearing on 152 radio shows and 89 television programs to recruit 
VISTA and Head Start workers. She also hosted "Coffee With the First Lady" and 
fund-raising telethons for Democratic candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 When Johnson named her consumer adviser, Miss Furness humorously parried 
criticism about a lack of experience as an average consumer by saying: "I will 
start shopping for myself tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
 Miss Furness was married three times -- in 1937 to composer and conductor John 
Waldo Green, with whom she had a daughter, Barbara; in 1945 to radio announcer 
Hugh B. Ernst, who died in 1950, and in 1967 to Midgley, executive producer of 
news for CBS.

LATEST CLIPPER LOSS DISGUSTS WILKINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS BAKER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dominique Wilkins has seen enough. 
</P>
<P>
 After watching the Clippers fall behind the Houston Rockets by 22 points in 
the first half of Sunday's 106-98 loss before an announced crowd of 10,474 at 
the Sports Arena, Wilkins seemed disgusted. 
</P>
<P>
 "You've got to have pride in what you do," said Wilkins, who had 36 points and 
11 rebounds. "We're not playing for the playoffs right now, but we are playing 
for pride. If you can't play for that, you don't need to be here." 
</P>
<P>
 It seems that the Clippers (25-46), who have lost five games in a row and have 
been virtually eliminated from the playoffs, can't wait for the season to end. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the wrong approach to take in a game," Wilkins said. "It's like once 
you lose a chance to compete for something, you quit. But in a sense you're 
still competing for something, you're competing for yourself and respect. And 
if you can't compete for that, I'd say it's time to go somewhere else. It's 
incredible." 
</P>
<P>
 Frustrated over missing the NBA playoffs for the first time in his seven-year 
pro career, guard Mark Jackson said he doesn't want to remain with the Clippers 
unless the team is overhauled in the off-season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm tired of talking," Jackson said. "When you lose, you have to have a 
bitter taste. You don't laugh and joke when you lose. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it's like this, I don't want to be a part of it, because I'm about winning 
and this is a very tough time. But it's a learning experience. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is my first time not being in the playoffs, so I know what it takes to 
get there. . . . It's very ugly. We have do so something coming into next year. 
I think we still have the talent to do it. If we can get some guys signed and 
we'll have a high lottery pick, so we'll have the opportunity to get back where 
we were. 
</P>
<P>
 "But if the commitment isn't there to make some changes, I don't want to be a 
part of it." 
</P>
<P>
 Clipper Coach Bob Weiss understands Jackson's frustration. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's important that we just finish up on the right note and just try 
to play well," Weiss said. "I think (Jackson) looks ahead at what we can do 
during the summer or what we can do next year." 
</P>
<P>
 Is Weiss, who has two years remaining on his contract, concerned about whether 
the Clippers will retain him? 
</P>
<P>
 "No, not really," Weiss said. "I've got enough things to worry about. It's out 
of my hands. In any position, it's a waste of time to worry about things you 
can't control." 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers looked ragged in the first half. After making 34.6% of their 
shots in the first quarter, they made 27% in the second.  
</P>
<P>
 "We've just got so many problems, so many attitudes, it just makes you sick 
sometimes," Clipper center Elmore Spencer said. "You see the symptoms out there 
on the court. 
</P>
<P>
 "We still have selfishness and other problems going around and they've come 
back to the forefront. If I knew (why), I'd be the GM of a championship team." 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers were unable to contain Rocket center Hakeem Olajuwon, who had 39 
points, 11 rebounds and six blocked shots in helping the Rockets (51-20) to 
their eighth consecutive victory over the Clippers. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's not a 7-footer in the league that can do what he does with the 
basketball," Spencer said.

WHIMPER AND BANG MARK OPENING DAY; BASEBALL: LANKFORD LEADS OFF SEASON WITH A 
HOME RUN, BUT FEW SEE CARDINALS DEFEAT REDS, 6-4. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ray Lankford opened baseball's new era with a home run, not that many people 
were there to see it. 
</P>
<P>
 Marge Schott, the Cincinnati Reds' owner, treated the first Sunday night 
season opener like an exhibition. The stadium reflected it and her team played 
that way, too. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Tewksbury pitched six innings and doubled home the go-ahead runs as the 
St. Louis Cardinals defeated the Reds, 6-4, in a stadium little more than 
half-filled. 
</P>
<P>
 The game launched a season of realigned divisions and a new playoff format. It 
also replayed an old theme -- controversy caused by Schott. 
</P>
<P>
 Unhappy that the city could not put together a pregame parade, Schott snubbed 
the opener and designated the Monday game as opening day. There was none of the 
usual opening day window dressing -- no bunting, no fanfare. Her attitude 
rubbed off on the fans: only 32,803 turned out, the smallest opening crowd in 
Riverfront Stadium's 24-year history. 
</P>
<P>
 "It didn't seem like opening night at all," Tewksbury said. "Part of that I 
think is because it was a night game, and part of that was the way that Marge 
treated it like she didn't want it to be the opening game." 
</P>
<P>
 Schott's attitude rubbed off on her team, too. The Reds committed three 
errors, let in a run with a passed ball and wasted an early 3-1 lead in a game 
between new NL Central rivals. 
</P>
<P>
 Lankford got baseball's 125th season started with a leadoff homer -- the first 
season-opening homer in the major leagues in eight years -- and singled home 
another run off starter Jose Rijo. 
</P>
<P>
 The last player to open the season with a homer was Boston's Dwight Evans, who 
homered off Detroit's Jack Morris in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was Tewksbury, a career .147 hitter, who provided the key hit. He lined 
the first pitch from Rijo for a two-out, two-run double in the fourth, putting 
the Cardinals ahead to stay, 5-3. 
</P>
<P>
 Vicente Palacios struck out Reggie Sanders to end a bases-loaded threat in the 
seventh, and Mike Perez pitched the ninth for a save. 
</P>
<P>
 In today's openers, defending NL champion Philadelphia will travel to 
Colorado; New York will visit Chicago; Montreal travels to Houston; Pittsburgh 
is at San Francisco and Atlanta is at San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 In the AL, World Series champion Toronto plays host to Chicago; Seattle is at 
Cleveland; Texas is at New York; Detroit travels to Boston and Kansas City is 
at Baltimore. The Dodgers and Angels open their season on Tuesday.

FLOYD FEELS CHIPPER AFTER THE TRADITION; SENIOR GOLF: HE BEATS DOUGLASS WITH A 
NEAR-PERFECT SHOT ON THE FIRST HOLE OF SUDDEN DEATH TO WIN TOURNAMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN HAFNER, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Raymond Floyd is generally considered the best chipper in golf. After almost 
losing The Tradition to a fabulous chip by Dale Douglass on Sunday, Floyd won a 
playoff with a near-perfect one of his own. 
</P>
<P>
 Floyd had a closing four-under-par 68 for a 271 total. Douglass, trailing by 
four shots early in the last round, rallied with a 66 to force the playoff. 
</P>
<P>
 On the Senior PGA Tour, the 18th always is the first playoff hole. On the 
6,869-yard Cochise Course at Desert Mountain, the final hole is a 531-yard par 
five. That gave the advantage to Floyd, one of the really long hitters in the 
50-and-over group. 
</P>
<P>
 He and Douglass had broken a tie with Jim Colbert late in the round, and came 
to the 72nd hole even. Douglass, 57, the oldest of the contenders, came as 
close to winning as possible with his chip from above the green after his 
second shot went beyond the green. 
</P>
<P>
 Floyd was in the middle of the green in two, about 45 feet away, almost a sure 
bet for a birdie. Floyd putted to within three feet. Douglass knew he had to 
land his chip on the fringe in the high grass and have it roll down to the 
flag. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew it had to be a near-perfect shot," the winter resident of nearby 
Paradise Valley said. "I hit it just right and thought it was in to win the 
tournament. But it hit the flag and came out." 
</P>
<P>
 Given a reprieve, Floyd made the most of it while playing the same hole in the 
playoff. Both missed the green to the right, trying to reach it in two shots. 
</P>
<P>
 But Douglass was about 10 yards behind Floyd and facing a much more difficult 
shot. He tried the same chip shot he had before, but this time the chip failed 
to clear the heavy grass. When Floyd's chip came to rest 18 inches from the 
cup, it was all over and all he had left to do was collect the $127,500 first 
prize. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dale was absolutely robbed of the victory when the ball didn't stay in the 
cup for the eagle on the 72nd hole," Floyd said. "Although I didn't play my 
best, I liked the way I went about winning it. After all, Dale played the last 
nine in 31, including an eagle on 13 that made all three of us 15 under. 
</P>
<P>
 "I pitched the ball and chipped it very well all week. It should help going to 
the Masters next week." 
</P>
<P>
 Floyd, who either bogeyed or birdied nine of the last 10 holes, including the 
playoff, actually lost the lead he had held for most of the tournament when he 
bogeyed the 14th. That put both Douglass and Colbert ahead of him. Douglass 
took the lead with a birdie on 15 with an approach to within five feet on the 
par four.  
</P>
<P>
 With both Colbert and Floyd in the rough around the green on the 413-yard 
16th, Douglass appeared to be in position to win. He had only a four-foot putt 
to make for a birdie. But, from 30 feet away, Floyd hit a perfect chip and in 
the hole it went. When Douglass missed, they were tied again. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a day of near-misses for Douglass. On the first hole, his two-footer 
veered near the cup. He also missed a 10-footer at No. 4.  
</P>
<P>
 Except for the majors, Floyd will play mostly on the senior tour from now on. 
Who can blame him? In 24 senior events, he has won six and finished second six

 While Floyd thinks he may be ready for Augusta, so does Jack Nicklaus, who has 
won the Masters six times. Nicklaus came here acting like a lost soul, but his 
teacher, Jim Flick, worked with him all week. He improved to a 68 Sunday, 
finished 10 under and left in good spirits.

seven assists and seven rebounds and was named most valuable player in leading 
the East to a 77-73 victory over the West at the 32nd annual NABC All-Star game

NBA ROUNDUP; DREXLER TOO STRONG FOR NETS 
</P>

<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Portland Trail Blazers earned their 11th consecutive playoff berth the 
old-fashioned way Sunday, going to Clyde Drexler with the game on the line 
against the New Jersey Nets. 
</P>
<P>
 Drexler scored 25 of his season-high 34 points in the second half and made 
five free throws in the final 26 seconds, leading Portland to a 109-105 victory 
over the Nets. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those are the situations you live for," said Drexler, who made eight of 10 
shots after intermission. "You hope you can be in there and contribute. 
Everyone knows that the last five minutes you have to be ready to play. That's 
when most games are won and lost in this league." 
</P>
<P>
 Drexler was the reason the Trail Blazers were able to rally from a 10-point 
halftime deficit to win. He scored 13 points in the fourth quarter, including 
two go-ahead free throws with 26 seconds to play. 
</P>
<P>
 Phoenix 108, Denver 98 -- Kevin Johnson scored a career-high 42 points at 
Phoenix as the Suns tightened the Western Conference playoff race. 
</P>
<P>
 The Suns, who have beaten the Nuggets 11 consecutive times at Phoenix, 
extended their winning streak to five games. The Nuggets, whose lead over the 
Lakers was cut to 3 1/2 games in the race for the conference's final playoff 
berth, dropped their third in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson made 14 of 25 shots and 14 of 16 free throws and also matched a season 
high with 17 assists for Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
 Boston 135, Philadelphia 112 -- Sherman Douglas scored a season-high 27 points 
and had a career-high 22 assists at Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the 10th consecutive defeat and the 25th loss in 26 games for the 
76ers, who also have dropped 11 consecutive games at home -- a franchise 
record. The team lost 10 in a row at home in 1971-72. 
</P>
<P>
 Dino Radja added 25 points for the Celtics, who posted their highest point 
total of the season. Their previous high was 129 points against Sacramento on 
Dec. 8. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago 96, Detroit 93 -- Scottie Pippen had 26 points, nine rebounds and nine 
assists as the Bulls held off a late Detroit rally at Auburn Hills, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago, which led by four points at halftime, made 55% of its shots in the 
third quarter and built its lead to 70-55 with 4:26 to play in the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Horace Grant and B.J. Armstrong each scored 16 points for the Bulls. 
</P>
<P>
 Armstrong made four free throws in the last eight seconds.

 Mario Lemieux was nowhere to be found. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Pittsburgh Penguins' bus began the trip to the Richfield Coliseum at 
9 a.m. Sunday, Lemieux wasn't aboard.He'd forgotten to set his clock ahead an 
hour. 
</P>
<P>
 "The time change got to me this morning," said Lemieux, who made it to the 
neutral-site game at Richfield, Ohio in time to score two goals and two assists 
as the Penguins beat the Boston Bruins, 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
 The Penguins went 6-0 against Boston this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Dallas 6, Washington 3 -- Mike Modano got two goals and newcomer Pelle Eklund 
and Mike Craig scored 37 seconds apart in a four-goal second period that lifted 
the Stars at Landover, Md.

<P>
 The victory gave the Stars 92 points, tying them with Toronto for second-best 
in the Western Conference. 
</P>
<P>
 Detroit 3, St. Louis 3 -- Curtis Joseph made 47 saves at Detroit to help the 
Blues get a tie.

DISARCINA LIFTS ANGELS TO FREEWAY SWEEP; BASEBALL: HIS WINNING RBI IN A 5-4 
VICTORY OVER THE DODGERS HELPS TEAM COME OUT OF SPRING ON A POSITIVE NOTE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLIOTT TEAFORD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On another day, the compelling news from the Freeway Series finale might have 
been Gary DiSarcina's winning run-scoring single in the bottom of the ninth 
that gave the Angels a 5-4 victory over the Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
 But Darryl Strawberry's temporary disappearance overshadowed all other events 
on Sunday at Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Strawberry simply didn't show up, didn't phone and team officials didn't know 
his whereabouts until late Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
 On the field, DiSarcina saved the Angels twice in leading them to a three-game 
sweep and some much-needed momentum going into opening day Tuesday at 
Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
 First, he made a diving stop on Tim Wallach's hard-hit grounder in the sixth. 
Later, he delivered a one-out, bases-loaded single through the drawn-in infield 
and into right field to score Eduardo Perez with the winning run. 
</P>
<P>
 It left the Angels feeling good about themselves despite a 10-19 spring 
training record, and some shoddy, ninth-inning relief pitching from Joe Grahe 
on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Grahe gave up a solo home run to Mitch Webster that hooked around the 
right-field foul pole, and a run-scoring sacrifice fly by Jose Offerman that 
allowed the Dodgers to pull even, 4-4, in the ninth. Grahe got the victory, his 
second of the spring, by avoiding further trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't build on this," Angel Manager Buck Rodgers said. "But this is the 
way you want to come out of the spring. Blowing the lead in the ninth had 
pluses and minuses, but the pluses outweighed the minuses because it's good for 
the ballclub to come back after losing the lead." 
</P>
<P>
 There were other positive Angel developments, including Chili Davis' first 
home run of the spring, a two-run shot to left-center in the fourth inning, and 
starter Mark Leiter's six strong innings. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought I threw better in the last game in Arizona than today," Leiter 
said. "But velocity-wise I was pretty pleased." 
</P>
<P>
 Leiter, who gave up five hits and two runs with one strikeout and three walks, 
was grateful for DiSarcina's defensive support. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've always enjoyed watching DiSarcina," he said. "It's a great defense here. 
To see that kind of defense is outstanding. It gives you more confidence on the 
mound." 
</P>
<P>
 In the ninth, Perez led off with an infield single, then went to second on a 
single to center by Greg Myers. After Harold Reynolds sacrificed and Spike Owen 
was walked intentionally, loading the bases, DiSarcina singled off reliever Jim 
Gott. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's nice to have this over and start playing regular games," Rodgers said. 
"It's always gratifying to sweep the Dodgers because of the rivalry between 
these two clubs."

TITANS TAKE ADVANTAGE OF MISCUES TO BEAT UCSB 
</P>

<P>
 Cal State Fullerton, held without an extra-base hit for the first time in a 
game this season, beat UC Santa Barbara, 9-4, in a Big West Conference baseball 
game Sunday at Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 The Titans took advantage of eight walks, four of which scored, and a hit 
batter, who also scored. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton (26-6, 5-1 in conference), the top-ranked team in the nation, was 
coming off a 4-2 loss to Santa Barbara in the second game of a doubleheader 
Saturday. The Titans won the first game, 11-0. 
</P>
<P>
 "To be consistent you need to be opportunistic," Fullerton Coach Augie Garrido 
said. "I was most pleased with that today." 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton's Matt Wagner, who has taken over the role of third starter, gave up 
five hits and three runs in 7 2/3 innings to improve to 7-0. 
</P>
<P>
 Wagner, a sophomore right-hander, left with two outs and two on in the eighth 
and leading, 7-1. Reliever Derek Fahs gave up a three-run home run to Matt 
Bazzani, his eighth of the season. Fahs walked the next batter and was lifted 
in favor of Ted Silva. Silva gave up a single but struck out pinch-hitter John 
Minton to end the threat. 
</P>
<P>
 Silva pitched around a leadoff double in the ninth for his eighth save. He had 
seven saves as a freshman last season. 
</P>
<P>
 The Titans got RBI singles from Brian King and Jack Jones and Jeff Ferguson 
had a sacrifice fly to take a 3-0 lead in third. Jeremy Giambi had an RBI 
single and Fullerton also scored on an error and a fielder's choice to take a 
6-0 lead in the fifth. 
</P>
<P>
 Giambi added an RBI single in the seventh. The final two runs in the eighth 
came on a sacrifice fly by King and an error in the eighth. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton next travels to Long Beach State for a three-game series starting at 
7 p.m. Friday at Blair Field.

WOODBRIDGE'S JOHNSEN OUT TWO WEEKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Alison Johnsen, one of two Woodbridge softball players in a collision 
Saturday, is expected to be out about two weeks, Coach Alan Dugard said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnsen, a center fielder, and shortstop Carrie Brown were chasing a shallow 
fly ball and collided in the third inning of a game against Mater Dei in a 
Woodbridge tournament semifinal. 
</P>
<P>
 The game was delayed about 30 minutes and both girls were taken to the 
hospital, where they were held overnight for observation. Brown suffered a 
broken fibula. The game will resume today at 1 p.m. at Harvard Park with Mater 
Dei leading, 6-0.

SANTA ANITA; WEEKEND IS A HIT FOR GORDY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB MIESZERSKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After losing the first eight times he started in the United States, Alex The 
Great suddenly has discovered how to win. 
</P>
<P>
 Owned by Motown founder Berry Gordy, the 5-year-old Bairn horse won for the 
second time in his last four races, beating 14-1 shot Vegieman by 2 1/2 lengths 
Sunday in the $85,575 Miramontes Handicap at Santa Anita. 
</P>
<P>
 In earning his first U.S. stakes victory in the restricted Miramontes, 
British-bred Alex The Great, who paid $21.40, completed a successful weekend 
for Gordy and trainer Rodney Rash. The day before, Powis Castle ran second in 
the Jim Beam Stakes at Turfway Park and likely earned himself a trip to the 
Kentucky Derby. 
</P>
<P>
 Ridden by Chris Antley, Alex The Great was well off the pace early, began his 
rally wide on the turn, then drew away in the final furlong to win in 1:48 2/5 
for the 1 1/8 miles on turf. 
</P>
<P>
 "This horse has ability, there's never been any question about that," said 
Rash. "Two races back, he was only beaten a length by Semillon." Actually, the 
margin was 2 1/4 lengths in the San Marino Handicap and Alex The Great was also 
a nose behind Memento Mori, who finished seventh Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's been a nervous horse and he always gets hot and washy like he did today 
. . . I'd almost worry if he didn't get that way. But he'd been training well 
and I really did expect him to run well today. In fact, it's hard to believe he 
went off at 9-1." 
</P>
<P>
 Making his first start on turf, Vegieman came from last to finish second, a 
nose in front of 12-1 shot Kingdom Of Spain. River Boyne, the 11-10 favorite, 
finished 10th in the field of 11. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Six days before the Santa Anita Derby, it looks as if the race will have nine 
starters. 
</P>
<P>
 The most attractive of the races leading up to the Kentucky Derby will bring 
back the first three finishers in last month's San Felipe Stakes, three other 
stakes winners, two colts trained by Charlie Whittingham and Pollock's Luck, 
who will probably be the longest shot in the field. 
</P>
<P>
 Soul Of The Matter, who upset Brocco and Valiant Nature in the San Felipe, 
will have his final work for the 1 1/8-mile Derby either Wednesday or Thursday, 
trainer Richard Mandella said. 
</P>
<P>
 Valiant Nature, third in the aforementioned race in his first start of 1994, 
worked Sunday, going six furlongs in 1:13 3/5. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to Brocco and Pollock's Luck, the other probable starters are the 
Whittingham pair of Strodes Creek and Numerous, San Rafael winner Tabasco Cat, 
Robannier, who won a stakes race earlier this year at Bay Meadows, and likely 
pacesetter Fly'n J. Bryan, who is scheduled to work five furlongs this morning 
at Hollywood Park.

JAPANESE STOCKS FALL AS FEARS MOUNT THAT FED WILL HIKE RATES; MARKETS: TOKYO 
INVESTORS CONCERNED THAT THE GROWTH IN U.S. EMPLOYMENT WILL LEAD TO ACTION TO 
CHECK INFLATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Japanese stocks fell in early trading today after an upbeat U.S. employment 
report released Friday rekindled concern that the Federal Reserve will raise 
short-term rates in the U.S. to keep inflation in check, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first fifteen minutes of trading, the Tokyo Stock Exchange's benchmark 
Nikkei 225 average was down 257.36 points, or 1.34% at 19,019.80. The broader 
Topix index of all shares on the first section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange 
dropped 16.42 points, or 1.05%, to 1,554.76. 
</P>
<P>
 Nikkei 225 stock index futures for June delivery fell 400 points to 19,005 in 
Singapore. Futures in Osaka were yet to trade due to an imbalance of sell 
orders. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Labor Department said Friday that last month the U.S. created 456,000 
new jobs, the biggest gain in more than six years. The report sent the yield on 
the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond to its highest levels in 14 months, up from 
less than 7.10% to as high as 7.27%. 
</P>
<P>
 "These figures are proof that the U.S. economy is well on the road to 
recovery," said Tatsuya Oguchi, general manager of futures and options at James 
Capel Securities. 
</P>
<P>
 Many U.S. analysts were watching the performance of the Tokyo market today for 
clues to the direction of the U.S. market when it opens this morning. Other 
Asian markets, including Hong Kong, Australia, New Zealand, and Taiwan are 
closed today for holiday observances. 
</P>
<P>
 In the United States, the New York Stock Exchange index last week posted a 
loss of 139 points, continuing a sharp selloff of more than 300 points that 
began in earnest in early February. The dive has been attributed to a response 
to the Fed's moves to raise interest rates for the first time in five years. 
</P>
<P>
 The Federal Reserve has raised rates twice since Feb. 4, most recently to 3.5% 
from 3.25% on March 22. Following the Feb. 4 increase, Japanese stocks fell 
287.03 points, or 1.4%, while share prices slid 291.43 points, or 1.44% after 
the Federal Open Market Committee voted to raise short-term rates. 
</P>
<P>
 Oguchi predicted trading volume would be thin today because Japanese 
institutional and overseas investors will await reaction from investors abroad 
before actively entering the market. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, activity on the first section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange was 230 
million shares today, down from a six-month average of 337 million shares a 
day. 
</P>
<P>
 However, gains in stock prices at the end of last week and a rise in Japan's 
smaller indexes indicates that Japanese stocks could weather a rise in U.S. 
rates without much damage, said Paul Migliorato, a senior salesman at Jardine 
Fleming Securities. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the weakness in the bond market in the states is certainly going to 
unnerve Japan," Migliorato said. "But there have been some areas of strength, 
and I think Japan will be helped by the weekend and by the fact that American 
(inflationary) problems aren't necessarily Japan's problems." 
</P>
<P>
 Compared to a 3.67% drop in the Dow Jones industrial average, and a 5.10% fall 
in the Nasdaq index, Japan's over-the-counter market reached a new high for the 
year last week, rising 1.59%, Migliorato said. Since March 17, the Dow has 
declined 6%, or 229.18 points. 
</P>
<P>
 "Inflationary numbers in the U.S. don't necessarily mean inflationary things 
for Japan," Migliorato said. 
</P>
<P>
 Japanese bond prices also were down at the start of Tokyo trading as traders 
reacted to the fall in U.S. bonds on Friday. 
</P>

 Bond futures for June delivery, currently the active futures contract, were 
down 0.25 yen at 111.85 yen. The yield on the benchmark No. 157 10-year 
government bond was 3.925%, up 0.06%.  
</P>
<P>
 "With U.S. yields at 7.27%, we can't say there won't be an effect on Japanese 
bonds," said Mikinao Matsushita, a fund manager at BOT Asset Management, a unit 
of the Bank of Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
 "The influence of the U.S. bond price fall, however, will be limited," 
Matsushita said. "Actions by the Bank of Japan and movements in the currency 
market could divert attention away from the U.S." 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Treasury bonds opened higher in Tokyo today and the U.S. dollar was 
stronger against the yen, said Masashi Takiya, head of the customer desk at 
Industrial Bank of Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 In New York trading Friday, the dollar soared against most major currencies as 
the yield on U.S. bonds climbed following a government report showing the 
biggest gain in jobs since 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar will change hands between 103.30 to 104.20 yen during Tokyo trading 
hours, as it moves into the 103-106 yen range in the coming months, Takiya 
said.

BOOK REVIEW / NOVEL; SETS, CAST AND DRAMATIC SCRIPT GET PLAYED OUT IN THE MIND; 
IN THE PALACE OF THE MOVIE KING BY HORTENSE CALISHER ; RANDOM HOUSE, $25, 426 
PAGES 
</P>

 "Show, don't tell," goes the novelist's credo. Not easy to do if the novel is 
about a genius -- for instance, a world-class filmmaker. A writer of potboilers 
can simply say the hero is a genius, describe his cars and clothes and fawning 
underlings, his love affairs and box-office grosses, but to show genius in 
action -- that's a much more arduous task. 
</P>
<P>
 Doubly so if, as Hortense Calisher does, you disdain to show your "movie 
king," Paul Gonchev, actually making a movie. F. Scott Fitzgerald, in "The Last 
Tycoon," walked Monroe Stahr through a producer's typical day, giving him 
plenty of opportunities to display his acumen. Gonchev, however, is kept on the 
run by so many seriocomic events -- although these are rendered in the literary 
equivalent of slow motion -- that his only passport into the ranks of genius is 
his sensibility. 
</P>
<P>
 But what a sensibility it is! Calisher ("The False Entry," "New Yorkers") 
doesn't even bother to spend much time having Gonchev direct imaginary movies. 
The proof of his gift is simply the quality of his eye, his way of seeing 
everything and everybody he encounters -- much as Gulley Jimson, the painter in 
Joyce Cary's "The Horse's Mouth," experienced the world as a rainbow stippling 
of brush strokes. 
</P>
<P>
 Gonchev's world is wider than Jimson's. Born to an emigrant Russian family, he 
has grown up in Japan and worked for 16 years in Albania (which forbids its 
people to travel except vicariously to the foreign cities that Gonchev is 
allowed to duplicate in an elaborate complex of film sets). Then he is rescued 
or kidnaped -- he has mixed feelings about it -- and brought to the United 
States, where he is paraded on the college lecture circuit as a dissident. 
</P>
<P>
 At first we may think that Gonchev's "palace" is this collection of sets, 
built on a remote plateau in the Balkans and dubbed Elsinore (not after 
Hamlet's castle, as his fans think, but after the Southern California movie 
town). Or the estate where he and his actress wife, Vuksica, live in Albania. 
Or some of the fancy digs where he is lodged in the States. But the palace is 
really Gonchev's mind -- a supremely worldly mind, loyal to no country but 
adaptable to any, in which elements of Europe, Asia and America are 
continuously jostling. 
</P>
<P>
 The interior drama of Calisher's novel is a subtle one. Can Gonchev, who has 
produced art and lived passably well under the pressures of a totalitarian 
society, function in the chaotic vacuum of a free one? How can he put the 
pieces of himself together -- or should he? Is he hopelessly behind the times 
-- or, because of his very detachment, his rootlessness, ahead of them? 
</P>
<P>
 The exterior drama, in contrast, is full of action, conspiracy and farce. 
Gonchev, knocked out during his abduction, suffers a concussion that 
temporarily reduces him to only one of his languages: Japanese. His translator, 
Roko (who is not Japanese but Korean), becomes his lover. Back home, the wily 
Vuksica and her twin brother, Danilo, twice swap identities so that she too may 
escape. A mother shoots her son. In Orange County, during a quake, another 
Russian emigre is swallowed alive by a crack in the earth. 
</P>
<P>
 Calisher combines these dramas in a way that is both originally hers and 
traditionally literary, the antithesis of film. For such a long novel, "In the 
Palace of the Movie King" has only a few scenes. Each bulges with the mind 
stuff that novels specialize in -- memories; flashbacks; conversations with the 
dead; speculations on artistic, political and sexual boundaries -- and dialogue 
that is often funny but sometimes as elliptical as Henry James'. 
</P>
<P>
 The advantage of this method: Every scene has a payoff. The disadvantage: We 
have to wait a long time for it. 
</P>
<P>
 Is the waiting worthwhile? On balance, yes, thanks to the finesse of 
Calisher's language, the tension she is able to maintain between satire and 
genuine feeling, the robustness of her characters and the buoyant spirit of her 
hero, who refuses to be used by America -- "You grow fat on dissidence from far 
away" -- but embraces his bewildering, polyglot new country as a place where a 
filmmaker can "record wherever one is, while standing by the river of flux."

POP MUSIC REVIEW; PARTY, YES, BUT NONE OF THAT WEIRD STUFF FOR THE BREEDERS 
</P>

 The Breeders' "Cannonball" has been an inescapable presence on college and 
alternative radio for months now. Its ingeniously interlocking arrangement of 
lurching bass, powerful drum fills, oddly chirped vocals and woozy waves of 
lead guitar give it a vivid identity as a record. 
</P>
<P>
 On stage at the Palace on Friday, though, the Breeders de-emphasized their 
hit's intricacies and eccentricities, transforming it into a party anthem for 
the dance-floor faithful. 
</P>
<P>
 That pretty much typified the performance approach of the Breeders, a band 
that's helped make the world safe for weirdness but appears hesitant to be 
weird on stage. 
</P>
<P>
 You'd think the Ohio-based foursome would have the confidence to take it to 
the limit after moving so quickly to the front of the new-rock pack -- its two 
weekend shows at the Palace marked a significant growth in drawing power from 
its Troubadour show six months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The underground prominence of key members Kim Deal (then with the Pixies) and 
Tanya Donelly (Throwing Muses) was helpful when the band got going as a 
part-time side project five years ago, but you have to credit this recent 
growth spurt to music, not to credentials. 
</P>
<P>
 Deal's twin sister Kelley (a partner of Kim in an early, pre-Pixies version of 
the Breeders) has replaced Donelly, who took along some of the group's buoyancy 
when she left to form Belly. With holdover Josephine Wiggs on bass and new 
drummer Jimmy MacPherson, the Breeders now have the feel of a solid, inventive 
unit. 
</P>
<P>
 So do they want to be a bar band or an art band? 
</P>
<P>
 The Breeders come armed with a distinctive set of conflicting influences, from 
surf and British Invasion pop to free-form experimentation with trace elements 
of Sonic Youth and the Pixies. 
</P>
<P>
 These extremes rub against each other to create the band's defining friction. 
Their soaring tunes and sentiments are constantly subverted by odd time 
signatures and spiky textures. The result is a queasy, off-center feel, a blend 
of humor and ominousness that gives them a disquieting edge. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe it's too tough to reproduce all those elements on stage, or maybe 
they're just not interested in challenging their audience. In any case, the 
Palace show presented a more straightforwardly rocking side of the Breeders. 
</P>
<P>
 They aren't a personality band -- the most novel visual element was the sight 
of the identical Deals both puffing their cigarettes at opposite sides of the 
stage. They also generated a friendly, chatty presence and some playful verbal 
and physical sparring between the members. 
</P>
<P>
 Kim mainly played driving rhythm guitar and did the talking while lead 
guitarist Kelley applied off-kilter leads with a certain punk-derived naivete. 
On record their vocals can be tart and sharply defined, but here the sisters' 
close harmonies often made it sound like one thick, raspy voice stirred into 
the swirl. 
</P>
<P>
 Fair fun as far as it went, but at this point the Breeders aren't really doing 
themselves -- or their audience -- justice.

WEST MEETS EAST AT THE SIMON; LACMA COLLABORATION MIXES SIGHTS AND SOUNDS OF 
INDIA, NEPAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 A sad fact of life at the Norton Simon Museum in Pasadena is that many 
visitors don't bother to go downstairs after seeing the Old Masters, French 
Impressionist paintings and Asian artworks on the main floor. Of those who do, 
few venture beyond the Degas display at the base of the spiral staircase and 
still fewer wander as far as the final gallery of Southeast Asian art -- except 
to gaze through a window at a stone Buddha in a sunken garden. 
</P>
<P>
 But life goes on at the Simon, and facts change. The museum's last outpost now 
lures visitors with seductive sights and sounds. Fresh rose-colored paint warms 
the gallery's walls, Ravi Shankar's recorded music fills the air and classical 
Indian musical instruments sit on a red carpet in front of the window. All this 
is a backdrop for a new exhibition, "A Tale of Three Muses: Music, Poetry and 
Art in India and Nepal," which qualifies as a genuine milestone in the museum's 
evolution. 
</P>
<P>
 The show is the Simon's first collaboration with another museum, in this case 
the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. Simon curator Gloria Williams and 
Pratapaditya Pal, LACMA's senior curator of Indian and Southeast Asian art, 
have drawn on the two institutions' resources to show off little-known 
treasures and explore a multidisciplinary theme.  
</P>
<P>
 "Mr. Simon had a great admiration for the art of India and Nepal," said Sara 
Campbell, director of the Simon Museum. "This exhibition is both a tribute to 
his interest and a chance for Southern California's two great collections of 
South Asian art to share their riches." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Indian and Southeast Asian artworks compose one of the greatest -- 
though largely unsung -- strengths of LACMA's collection. The Simon Museum is 
generally celebrated for its European art, but Simon became a passionate 
collector of Asian art in the 1970s -- after his marriage to actress Jennifer 
Jones, who had studied Eastern philosophy and persuaded him to take his first 
trip to India. 
</P>
<P>
 At the heart of the landmark exhibition is a rare album of 36 paintings from 
Nepal, purchased in 1979 by Simon. They are accompanied by eight paintings from 
an addendum to the album, acquired in 1973 by LACMA. As to why, when and where 
the loose-leaf album was separated, little is known, but the fact that the two 
parts ended up in Southern California paved the way to reuniting the paintings 
for the first time since they were divided. 
</P>
<P>
 The jewel-like paintings -- each measuring about 7 by 5 1/2 inches -- come 
from a genre that flourished during the 17th Century, Williams said. Deriving 
their name, ragamala, from the Indian term for a garland of melodies, or ragas, 
the paintings epitomize a tradition of giving music a visual form. Musicians 
conceived of musical modes as having divine and human forms. Poets interpreted 
the melodies as verses and artists painted the verses, often including Sanskrit 
text with their pictures. 
</P>
<P>
 That explains the "Three Muses" in the show's title, but deciphering the 
paintings can be difficult. The exhibition's text panels and labels help, but 
they also reveal unsuspected subtleties. 
</P>
<P>
 Visitors learn, for example, that ragas not only have musical and human form, 
they refer to colors, passions, seasons and times of day. While musical ragas 
could be used for religious purposes, pictorial ragas were secular and earthy 
-- typically portraying Hindu gods, princes and beautiful women in an eternal 
cycle of love and longing. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Each of the paintings in the album presents figures in an architectural 
framework, with poetry at the top of the sheet. The paintings are displayed in 
groups of six, with a portrayal of a male figure surrounded by five depictions 
of women who either await his arrival or greet him in various states of 
emotion. The women -- who sprinkle flower petals on their beds or amuse 
themselves in gardens -- appear to have nothing better to do than prepare for 
trysts and pout when their lovers are tardy, but their task in these paintings 
is to evoke erotic moods and amorous situations. They are archetypes rather 
than personalities. 
</P>
<P>
 Although little is known of how ragamala paintings were used, they were 
produced for Hindu and Muslim noblemen and regarded as prestigious gifts, 
Williams said. The work owned by the Simon and County museums is thought to 
have been commissioned by a king who presided over Bhaktapur, in the Kathmandu 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast to the dark, predominantly red Nepali works, several Indian 
ragamala paintings from LACMA's collection portray figures and cross-sections 
of buildings in a varied palette of pastels and bright hues. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Musically-themed stone and metal sculptures from the two museums' and Jennifer 
Jones Simon's collections provide a counterpoint of art-in-the-round. Unlike 
the paintings, which secret erotic details in tiny spaces, the sculptures 
flaunt sensuousness. 
</P>
<P>
 Muscular gods and voluptuous goddesses play flutes and stringed instruments, 
while a group of five celestial musicians -- some with animals heads -- compose 
an orchestra along one wall. This sculptural group joined LACMA's collection 
more than a year ago, but it is making its Southern California debut at the 
Simon Museum.

 Changing Charlies: Charles Kuralt bid goodby to CBS' "Sunday Morning" on 
Sunday. "Time for us to part, you and I," said Kuralt, 59, who is retiring from 
CBS News after 37 years. "I aim to do some traveling and reading and writing, 
and to watch this program the civilized way for a change -- in my bathrobe, 
while having breakfast." He kept his sign-off to a tight 60 seconds, including 
the recitation of a poem by Clarence Day that goes, in part: "Farewell, my 
friends, farewell and hail; I'm off to seek the Holy Grail. . . . 
Tiddly-widdly-toodle-oo." After the final fade-out, Kuralt was met with cheers 
from 50 current and former colleagues. Charles Osgood will succeed Kuralt as 
anchor of the program beginning this week. Osgood, 61, shares a reputation with 
Kuralt as one of the best writers in broadcasting. He anchors and writes "The 
Osgood Files" on CBS Radio and provides commentary for "CBS This Morning." 
Osgood joined CBS News in 1971 and anchored the network's morning news show 
from 1987 to 1992. CBS News President Eric Ober said that Osgood will continue 
his work on CBS Radio and that the format of "Sunday Morning" will remain the 
same.

 No April Fool's Joke: ABC's "Home" show, which last month deleted comments by 
a guest who criticized alcohol advertising, had to go to the editing machine 
again Friday when movie reviewer Nora Fraser abruptly halted her assessment of 
"Clifford" and spoke out against the mistreatment of farm animals. Her remarks 
were carried live on the East Coast but were deleted for the tape-delayed 
broadcast in the West -- including her giving out the phone number for the 
Humane Farming Assn. A spokesman for the San Francisco-based animal rights 
group said it received hundreds of phone inquiries after the broadcast. ABC 
could not be reached for comment. "Home" is going off the air Friday, a victim 
of low ratings.

 The Magic Touch: New coach Magic Johnson isn't only trying to inspire the 
Lakers' performance in the NBA, he's also helping the team's television 
ratings. Thursday's 95-92 loss to Seattle -- the Lakers' first game on a Los 
Angeles TV station with Johnson as coach -- drew a 7.4 rating for KCAL-TV 
Channel 9, the highest of the season, according to figures compiled by A. C. 
Nielsen Co. The previous best was a 6.8 for a 109-102 victory at Orlando on 
Dec. 21. By comparison, the Clippers-Phoenix Suns telecast that began half an 
hour later Thursday on KCOP-TV Channel 13 had a 1.3 rating. Each local rating 
point represents 50,064 households.

 Lawsuit: Soap opera star Brian Patrick Clarke, who plays Storm on "The Bold

roughed up when he complained about his car being towed. Clarke sued Police 
Chief Willie Williams and the two officers who arrested him last summer, Darren 
Holst and Samuel Huizar, in L.A. Superior Court on Friday seeking unspecified 
damages for alleged assault and battery, negligence, false imprisonment and 
civil rights violations. Clarke claims that he left a movie theater to find his 
car towed and that when he asked the officers about it he was sprayed with a

 Home Run: "Major League II," the baseball comedy from Warner Bros., slid into 
first place at the box office during the Easter weekend. The movie took in $7 
million, according to early industry estimates. Another sports movie sequel was 
next: Walt Disney Pictures' "D2: The Mighty Ducks" grossed $6.6 million. In 
third, Universal's "The Paper" with $5.6 million, and in fourth, Paramount's 
"Naked Gun 33 1/3: The Final Insult" with $5.3 million. Universal's 
"Schindler's List," was still a force in fifth place with $4 million. STAGE

 Tickets Fly Away: "Welcome Back Eagles, We've Waited Long Enough," read a 
banner outside the Irvine Meadows Amphitheatre on Saturday where thousands of 
fans crowded the parking lot waiting to buy tickets to the Eagles reunion 
concert. But many Eagles fans will still have to wait to hear the mellow band. 
The 60,000 tickets for the originally scheduled four shows on May 27, 28, 29 
and 31, plus 15,000 tickets for a fifth show added June 1 to meet the demand, 
sold out in just 90 minutes. Fans who arrived at the amphitheater as early as 
5:45 a.m. did not have an advantage -- to control the crowd, numbers were given 
out at random to those who showed up before 7 a.m. Each person was allowed to 
buy up to eight tickets. There were also lines of up to 500 people at 
Ticketmaster ticket agencies in the Southland. And countless others tried to 
get through to the Ticketmaster phone lines. The tickets for the Eagles concert 
set for June 2 at the Glen Helen Blockbuster Pavilion in San Bernardino also 
sold out briskly.

 Murder, They Wrote: Two new books claim Rolling Stones guitarist Brian Jones 
was murdered in his swimming pool in 1969, a month after he split with the 
band. A coroner ruled at the time that 27-year-old Jones drowned in the pool at 
his Sussex, England, estate "while under the influence of alcohol and drugs." 
Both books -- "Paint It Black: The Murder of Brian Jones" by Geoffrey Giuliano 
and "Who Killed Christopher Robin?" by Terry Rawlings -- claim the pop star was 
murdered by London builder Frank Thorogood, who died in November. The books 
were excerpted in London tabloid newspapers on Sunday. Sussex police said they 
would look at any new evidence. BETH KLEID

ANDREA'S '90210' DEFENDERS SKIP REALITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I applaud the way that the "Beverly Hills, 90210" family has rallied around 
Gabrielle Carteris and supported her decision to have a child and keep working 
("That '90210' Piece -- It's Rubbish"; "Television Doesn't Need Any More Women 
'Victims,' " Counterpunch, March 28). But, in their Counterpunches responding 
to my commentary, "On the Dumping of a '90210' Role Model" (March 15), there is 
a certain confusion between what's good for the actress, a 30-year-old woman 
with a well-launched career, and what's good for Andrea Zuckerman, the 
character she plays on the show, an 18- or 19-year-old girl in her first year 
at university. 
</P>
<P>
 The "90210" producers and writers are not parents standing by their teen-age 
daughter who wants to keep her baby after getting pregnant by mistake. Rather, 
they are opinion makers who have a responsibility to a very large teen-age 
audience who may face pregnancy before they have finished schooling. 
</P>
<P>
 Having a baby is hard -- financially, emotionally, physically -- under the 
best of circumstances. Total up the stress of earning (or borrowing) enough 
money to pay for tuition, rent, food and clothing; finding and affording 
suitable child care; shopping, cooking, cleaning and looking after a baby when 
you're not at school or work; and studying enough hours to get the high marks 
required for medical school admission -- all on just a few hours of sleep a 
night -- and it becomes evident why scriptwriters Rosanne Welch and Christine 
Pettit think Zuckerman should be "canonized." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course it's possible -- and eventually desirable -- to have both a family 
and a career, but the point is that Zuckerman, unlike Carteris, is doing it the 
hardest way possible. By making Zuckerman have a baby before she finishes her 
education, the "90210" team has narrowed, not widened, her choices and made 
teen-age pregnancy appear to be an attractive option. In the real world, her 
chances of ever becoming a doctor would be slender indeed. 
</P>
<P>
 I wish her luck on the rocky road the "90210" writers and producers have 
selected for her. But I wouldn't want my daughter to follow her example. Or my 
son, for that matter. 
</P>
<P>
 JUDY SKLAR RASMINSKY 
</P>
<P>
 Westmount, Quebec 
</P>
<P>
 If Zuckerman is a modern, intelligent woman, then I'd like to know how she 
wound up pregnant. Isn't she aware of birth control? Has she considered that 
her partner may be HIV positive, or have they both been tested? 
</P>
<P>
 Writers Welch and Pettit posture themselves as '90s feminists. Their 
Counterpunch assures us that they are "not anti-men" (as though that were 
relevant to this debate). I am left to assume Welch and Pettit consider it 
anti-male to insist that a man take some responsibility for birth control. 
Andrea is hardly a modern young woman. She is the same young woman we've been 
fed for years -- one who is victimized by her own passivity, unable to demand 
her partner use protection and yet not willing to take responsibility for it 
herself. 
</P>
<P>
 Carteris ("On Andrea and Motherhood," March 28), and the show's producer, 
Charles Rosin, have rationalized Zuckerman's pregnancy to avoid the economic 
and creative problems that Carteris' real-life pregnancy poses. They throw 
around such words as choice when explaining why the TV character is keeping her 
child. Statistics show that single mothers don't have many choices. They end up 
living in poverty.

SPEAKING UP FOR LUPONE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Please allow me to lend my voice to Glenn Wein's in speaking up for Patti 
LuPone ("A 'Sunset' Without LuPone Is Dark Day for Theater," March 14). Perhaps 
a lot of small voices will add up to one large one. 
</P>
<P>
 I count myself among the lucky who experienced LuPone's brilliance in London. 
It is a theater experience I will have for a lifetime; her voice is so strong 
and moving. It was a performance that yanked the audience from their seats and 
brought tears to my eyes, as to those of many others in the audience that 
night. Fortunately, LuPone is immortalized on the "Sunset" London recording. It 
will stand the test of time. 
</P>
<P>
 I've seen Glenn Close in the role and she is good, but is that enough? It 
wasn't for me. By replacing LuPone with Close in the Broadway production, 
Andrew Lloyd Webber is robbing the New York theater community of a great vocal 
performance. He may just discover, when his show reaches Broadway, that his 
musical is big but that his audience got small.

RAP'S MESSAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I was displeased with the March 7 Counterpunch by Eric Taylor, "Gangsta Rap Is 
Deferring the Dream." His outlook seems out of focus to the reality of rap 
music's message.While I do agree that gangsta rap is a negative message for our 
youth and women, saying that it's delaying the dream or setting it back has 
nothing to do with the lyrics. 
</P>
<P>
 Taylor mentions that some great leaders have striven to make lives of African 
Americans and others more desirable and comfortable. But only allowing black 
conservatives that want to be accepted to jump on the bandwagon is to keep 
matters the way they are! 
</P>
<P>
 I can remember at a young age listening to songs with lyrics that were 
nonsense, non-positive and negative, and this was before the rap era. The 
flamboyant terminology of rappers is common in their 'hoods. And if you tune in 
to local or premium networks, you hear the same topics. 
</P>
<P>
 I can't speak for Snoop Doggy Dog, but there are more rappers than R&B artists 
that are giving back to their roots and not to mainstream society. So let's try 
to coordinate our values and thoughts to make our world a great place to live 
and honor instead of criticizing the ones of easy prey.

POP; JOHN HIATT, DOGS DELIVER A NO-FRILLS ROCK CONCERT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WILLMAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If all John Hiatt did was toil over a hot note pad as a full-time tunesmith, 
you might have to rank him one of the more considerable talents in American 
rock. 
</P>
<P>
 But he's got the chops to deliver his own emotive material better than any of 
his many interpreters. And now, finally, in the form of the Guilty Dogs, he can 
claim a steamy little backup band that makes his deceptively simple, 
effortless-sounding songwriting sound like hard work all over again. 
</P>
<P>
 Hiatt and company began touring behind his "Perfectly Good Guitar" album seven 
months ago at the Roxy and ended a major leg of the extended road stint on 
Friday at the Wiltern. 
</P>
<P>
 The flesh was occasionally weak -- more than half a year later, Hiatt couldn't 
quite hit all the notes he strived for -- but the spirit was more than willing 
enough in a generous two-hour show that emphasized the traditional values of 
no-frills quartet rock 'n' roll. 
</P>
<P>
 Other values were also at work, given the number of songs in his catalogue 
that mention the wife and kids. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of Hiatt's appeal is that he's as close a cross as rock is likely to come 
between Mick Jagger, Ray Charles and Robert Young, combining a time-tested, 
slurred-vowel cockiness with the warmth, assurance and manageable anxiety of 
home. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If anything, Hiatt's been in danger of getting too cozy in recent years, with 
his agreeable, jes'-folks persona perhaps undercutting more serious 
inclinations. But "Perfectly Good" provided a good, restless pinch of the 
middle-aged crazy, and the Wiltern show had the proverbial fire in the belly, 
with homespun anecdotes playing second fiddle to Mike Ward's heavy, anchoring 
guitar leads. 
</P>
<P>
 Solo turns with "Icy Blue Heart" and "Have a Little Faith in Me" justified the 
"an evening with" billing, but this was basically a band show, pushed and 
bruised by Hiatt's best cadre of players (not counting Little Village) since 
his quasi-new-wave days a decade and a half ago.

POP AND JAZZ REVIEWS; SABAL-LECCO, FRIENDS: LESSON IN TEAMWORK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON HECKMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With a resume that includes stints with Paul Simon, the Brecker Brothers and 
Herbie Hancock, bassist Armand Sabal-Lecco is one of the hottest new players on 
the jazz scene. The group he brought to La Ve Lee Friday night, however, was 
less a showcase for his extraordinary skills than an object demonstration in 
superb ensemble work. 
</P>
<P>
 For most of the opening set, Sabal-Lecco played an integrative role, laying 
down a constantly changing rhythmic line in support of a colorful mix of both 
collective and solo passages from his six-piece band. Only on the final number, 
"We Jam for Food," did he spring loose with a virtuosic display of slaps, 
thunks, roars and runs that thoroughly justified his rapidly emerging 
prominence. 
</P>
<P>
 Good as Sabal-Lecco's playing may have been, his sense of leadership and 
musicality was even better. Every musician in the group -- David Goldblatt on 
keyboards, Stave Tavaglione on winds, Danny Reyes on percussion, Kirk Covington 
on drums and Ramon Stagnaro on guitar -- was a first-rate soloist. And 
Sabal-Lecco managed to give each ample time for improvisation while still 
maintaining an unfolding compositional structure that occasionally recalled the 
music of Weather Report and Miles Davis' finest ensembles. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a delightful exhibition of contemporary jazz, and an encouraging 
indication that the '90s -- fueled by players such as Sabal-Lecco -- may yet 
provide an influential new generation of jazz artists. DON HECKMAN

POP AND JAZZ REVIEWS; DURCAL CONFIRMS HER STATUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ENRIQUE LOPETEGUI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Known in her native Spain as a popular actress and ballad singer, Rocio Durcal 
recorded six successful albums of rancheras in Mexico in the last few years, 
and is treated by the Mexican audience as one of the major singers in mariachi 
music -- a real achievement considering Mexico's pride in its native artists. 
</P>
<P>
 In her return on Saturday to the Universal Amphitheater after two years, 
Durcal not only confirmed her status in the ranchera field, but also reminded 
everyone that she is one of the most complete all-around performers in Latin 
music. 
</P>
<P>
 Backed by the Los Angeles-based Mariachi America and a six-member group of 
technically capable but passionless musicians, Durcal did more than just 
present classics and songs from her new "Desaires" ("Snubs") album -- she 
opened with show-stopping flamenco vocals and went on to tango, keeping her own 
Spanish accent in a way that only an artist who truly knows the essence of the 
music could have done. 
</P>
<P>
 The highlight of her ranchera set was her duet with Spanish singer Jose Carlos 
on "Y nos dieron las diez," a hit popularized worldwide by the acclaimed 
Spanish pop songwriter Joaquin Sabina. 
</P>
<P>
 Durcal's voice and stage presence are enough to put her a notch or two above 
the average pop star. ENRIQUE LOPETEGUI

SPECIAL SCREENINGS: A GENEROUS LOOK AT 'FILMS OF BERTOLUCCI' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The American Cinematheque's "At the Center of the Labyrinth: The Films of 
Bernardo Bertolucci," which will be held Friday through Sunday at the Directors 
Guild, 7920 Sunset Blvd., affords a chance to see films that have made 
Bertolucci one of the most famous of international directors and those that 
surface only occasionally. 
</P>
<P>
 A generous selection of his pictures will be presented chronologically, 
starting with his 1962 debut feature "The Grim Reaper" ("La Commare Seca"), 
which screens Friday at 7 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the one film that most Bertolucci admirers have never been able to 
see. He had just worked as an assistant to Pier Paolo Pasolini on Pasolini's 
first film "Accatone" (1961), and the older director came up with a five-page 
outline for "Reaper." An experiment in style rather than a straightforward 
investigation of the last day in the life of a murdered prostitute, "The Grim 
Reaper" reveals that from his very first shot Bertolucci had that commanding, 
sweeping camera movement that remains his signature. 
</P>
<P>
 The film is a graceful, even poetic, account of the everyday lives of a series 
of mainly young people, but it is also discursive to the extent that it 
constantly invites the viewer's attention to wander. 
</P>
<P>
 Bertolucci's next picture, the 1964 "Before the Revolution" (Friday at 9:30), 
is an entirely different matter, as bold and emphatic an announcement that a 
major director has arrived as has ever been made. Bertolucci brings a profound 
poignancy to a young man's painful discovery of self by showing that his 
growing awareness of his own limitations is equaled by his recognition of the 
vast possibilities of life itself.  
</P>
<P>
 Bertolucci gets away with dazzling techniques by making them form the 
structure of his story and by using them to probe the psyches of his 
characters, principally the 18-year-old scion (Francesco Marilli) of an upper 
middle class Parmesan family, and his beautiful, comforting aunt (Adriana 
Asti). 
</P>
<P>
 One of Bertolucci's less familiar -- and most challenging -- films, the 1968 
"Partner" (Saturday at 6:30 p.m.), in which it becomes all but impossible to 
tell where reality leaves off and fantasy begins, is a loose adaptation of 
Dostoevsky's "The Double" that asks us to consider the paradoxical nature of 
the imagination with its power both to transform and to deceive. Not to be 
missed is Saturday night's double feature, starting at 8:45 with "The Spider's 
Stratagem" (1970), which in its abstractness is a quite demanding yet fully 
satisfying tale about a man (Giulio Brogi) summoned by his father's mistress 
(Alida Valli) to a deserted ancient town where his father has been immortalized 
as an anti-fascist martyr.  
</P>
<P>
 Following it is the bravura "The Conformist" (1970), in which Bertolucci gets 
away with outrageous theatricality and bald coincidence in telling of a 
repressed philosophy professor (Jean-Louis Trintignant) recruited for a 
dangerous mission by a fascist espionage organization. 
</P>
<P>
 For a schedule: (213) 466-FILM. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Enchanted Showcase: Lovely and talented May McAvoy had the good fortune to be 
leading lady of two often-revived landmark films, "Ben-Hur" (1926) and "The 
Jazz Singer" (1927), but the rarely seen film that reveals the true range of 
her artistry is John Robertson's exquisite 1924 version of Arthur Wing Pinero's 
play, "The Enchanted Cottage" (at the Silent Movie Friday and Saturday at 8 
p.m.).  
</P>
<P>
 Except for her radiant eyes you would not recognize McAvoy, who's been given a 
small bump on her nose and slightly buck teeth to play a rural English spinster 
who's merely plain but who regards herself as ugly. That's fine with the film's 
hero, played by Richard Barthelmess, a wounded British World War I flier with a 
badly crippled leg who sees her as an ideal mate in a marriage de raison , 
which flowers into such genuine love that he comes to see her as beautiful and 
she to see him as physically perfect. 
</P>
<P>
 Robertson brings off this timeless tale, and while Barthelmess is splendid as 
a man mired in self-pity, it is McAvoy who is sublime as a woman whose 
vulnerability is exceeded by her capacity for devotion. Information: (213) 
653-2389.

TV REVIEWS; 'CONTESSA' STEPS INTO A MASQUERADE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JON MATSUMOTO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A modern day Cinderella story, Fox's "The Counterfeit Contessa" strives to be 
both a soft 'n' breezy piece of entertainment and a hip TV movie with an 
irreverent wit and meaningful message. 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, this isn't an easy balancing act to pull off. And while it makes a 
spirited effort, "The Counterfeit Contessa" never convincingly evolves into the 
type of easily digestible and smartly adventurous romantic comedy its producers 
intended it to be. 
</P>
<P>
 There are some wonderfully funny and clever moments to this film about a 
working-class Italian American woman yearning for an ideal romance. The comedic 
aspects of the movie are often incisive and wickedly intelligent, especially 
when they deal with the underlying subject of class division and values. But 
the choice lines of witty dialogue usually fall to a handful of the film's 
colorful subsidiary characters, leaving our protagonist Gina (Tea Leoni) 
appearing comely but rather dull. 
</P>
<P>
 When a handsome and well-bred businessman named Sinclair Everett (David 
Beecroft) mistakes Gina for a visiting Italian contessa while she is preparing 
to model in a department store fashion show, she decides to play along with 
this implausible misperception. She wants to be courted like a socialite even 
if it's just for a few fleeting evenings. 
</P>
<P>
 Gina's entry into high society leads to a number of humorous situations. But 
the film's real sparks are generated by Sinclair's two nonconformist siblings, 
Dawson (D.W. Moffett) and Helena (Nikki De Boer). An artist-type who shares 
little of his family's obsession with wealth and status, Dawson is an impish 
rebel with a quick wit. Similarly, Helena is a spunky debutante in revolt. 
</P>
<P>
 With Gina mired naively in her Harlequin-esque fantasy world, you keep hoping 
that the under-utilized Helena will find a way to take over the movie. No such 
luck. 
</P>
<P>
 * "The Counterfeit Contessa" airs at 8 tonight on Fox (Channels 11 and 6).

TV REVIEWS; 'SIMPLE MEN' GO IN SEARCH OF THEIR DAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY LOYND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 PBS' "American Playhouse," noted for its consistently provocative, creative 
programming, has blown the limits of viewer patience this time out. 
</P>
<P>
 Writer-director Hal Hartley's "Simple Men," about two wildly different young 
brothers and their joint search on the back roads of Long Island for their 
long-lost radical/activist dad, is too quirky and arch an experiment to sustain 
its shaky moorings. 
</P>
<P>
 Most aggravating about Hartley's style is not so much the visual dead spots 
masquerading as pregnant pauses but his stylized dialogue and aphorisms that 
sound like a collegiate trick. Minimalism as a concept is fine, but the spare, 
abbreviated conversations here become tiresome, even exhausting. 
</P>
<P>
 Hartley's acting family here features campus cohorts from the acting program 
at the State University of New York at Purchase (notably the cynical Robert 
Burke and the bookish William Sage as the star-crossed brothers, and the 
quietly absorbing Karen Sillas as an independent-minded proprietor of a 
roadhouse who falls for one of the brothers.) 
</P>
<P>
 * "Simple Men" airs at 9 tonight on KCET-TV Channel 28 and KPBS-TV Channel 15.

PLANNERS SEEK INPUT FOR CAL STATE CAMPUS; EDUCATION: OFFICIALS HOPE THAT 
THURSDAY MEETING ELICITS IDEAS FROM RESIDENTS AND THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY FOR A 
PUBLIC- PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOANNA M. MILLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The planned Cal State University in Ventura County will be a college for the 
21st Century, one that links the campus to the world with electronic images but 
offers down-to-earth programs such as agriculture and ecology as well. 
</P>
<P>
 University planners envision a public-private partnership at the campus. For 
instance, a large performing arts center to be used by students and community 
groups alike might be financed by both sectors. 
</P>
<P>
 Planners are working under a mandate to "think creatively," envisioning 
everything from a privately financed monorail or federally subsidized electric 
cars to reduce traffic, to low-tech solutions such as community bike trails. 
</P>
<P>
 Architects have not revealed sketches of the exterior of the university, which 
will be built on a 260-acre lemon orchard west of Camarillo. But concepts under 
discussion range from Spanish style to modern, from high-rise structures with 
lots of open space to a more low-profile set of buildings, possibly 
incorporating the surrounding orchard into the landscape or even the 
curriculum. 
</P>
<P>
 No funding is available now for anything beyond land purchase and master 
planning. But residents are invited to a meeting Thursday to share ideas on the 
kind of university they want. 
</P>
<P>
 David Leveille, director of institutional relations for Cal State, said that 
even a monorail is possible, depending on the private sector's involvement. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not looking to the state to finance the whole campus," Leveille said. 
"There may be opportunities for private investment as well. We need to think 
creatively." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite a lack of funds, Chancellor Barry Munitz said Cal State is committed 
to developing a campus in Ventura County, the largest county in the state 
without a public four-year college. Planners hope to have students on campus 
soon after the year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we stop, it sends all the wrong signals -- that we've given up or we don't 
think it's important," he said. "My response is to keep the pressure on." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Munitz said voters who care about higher education must urge state legislators 
to provide for it in the budget. And Cal State must continue planning for its 
growing student body, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not going to happen tomorrow," he said of the Ventura County campus. 
"But if we don't work on it tomorrow, it will never happen at all." 
</P>
<P>
 The site was selected in 1991 after a seven-year battle to find a location in 
Ventura County that was suitable and politically acceptable to nearby residents 
and elected officials. 
</P>
<P>
 During that time, the state economy turned sour, and Cal State's operating and 
maintenance budgets were cut, leaving little for such capital projects as new 
campuses. 
</P>
<P>
 But Munitz said Thursday's community meeting, together with the system's 
efforts to acquire the property through condemnation, show that the university 
is still committed to Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 The university has filed suit to take the property by eminent domain because 
owners of one parcel have refused to sell. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are at the mercy of the court," Leveille said. "But we are optimistic that 
something can be culminated within the next few months." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, university planners are inviting area residents, government 
officials and business people to the community meeting Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an opportunity for the whole community to offer input before the 
decisions are made," said Joyce M. Kennedy, director of the Ventura campus of 
Cal State Northridge. "We need to look at issues together in a spirit of 
cooperation rather than a spirit of confrontation." 
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy said the campus will serve as a center for the community, offering not 
only academic curricula but cultural programs as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "This campus will give the community a chance to not only understand but to 
celebrate the cultural diversity of the region," she said. "I expect the 
university to be a leader in this." 
</P>
<P>
 Leveille said the campus would also treat the county's largest economic sector 
as an important part of the curriculum. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to consider how we can take advantage of the campus being in an 
agriculture environment," he said. "We want to incorporate a lot of open space 
as well." 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Wittenberg, county administrative officer, called the planned 
university a "wonderful asset to our county." 
</P>
<P>
 He acknowledged the financial problems that Cal State as a whole is having, 
but said the county and the cities of Oxnard and Camarillo have already entered 
agreements to help the university wherever possible. The county is working with 
the U. S. Soil Conservation Service to ensure that a $12-million flood control 
project is built on the property. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 And the cities have asked the Ventura County Transportation Commission to 
spend county transportation dollars to develop roads leading to the site. They 
have also pledged staff time and services. 
</P>
<P>
 Wittenberg suggested that Cal State could start small in the county, as it did 
at Northridge 30 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember when that campus was a couple of Quonset huts," he said. "The main 
thing is we have to get started. We have to have a footprint." FYI 
</P>
<P>
 Cal State University plans the first in a series of public workshops to seek 
community input on the planning of a four-year public university in Ventura 
County. The meeting will be held from 6 to 9 p.m. Thursday at the Ventura 
County Government Center, Hall of Administration, 800 S. Victoria Ave., 
Ventura, in the Board of Supervisors meeting room. For information, call 
656-3606.

LAST OF POST-QUAKE METROLINK STATIONS OPENING IN OXNARD; TRANSPORTATION: NEW 
STOP COMES 10 WEEKS AFTER FEMA FUNDING ENABLED EXTENSION OF RAIL SERVICE. FETE 
PLANNED BEFORE FIRST DEPARTURE TODAY.

<P>
 Metrolink service rolls into Oxnard today, 10 weeks after earthquake-crumbled 
freeways prompted a federal agency to free up funds for commuter trains to run 
until October. 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard is the last of seven Metrolink stops added to the 250-mile rail service 
to help ease highway congestion as suburban commuters make their way around 
damaged freeways and into Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 A 5:15 a.m. celebration with free coffee, doughnuts and newspapers will mark 
the opening of the new stop, said Mary Travis, spokeswoman for the Ventura 
County Transportation Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 City and county officials are expected to be on hand, along with the Oxnard 
High School band and the Oxnard Strawberry Festival's mascot in a Fruit of the 
Loom-style berry costume. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a real accomplishment for us," Travis said. "A lot of people worked 
very hard to make this happen, so we wanted to have a little celebration." 
</P>
<P>
 Transit officials said other temporary stations have boosted overall 
ridership, indicating that residents are willing to make the extra effort take 
the train rather than drive to work. 
</P>
<P>
 Daily ridership from the temporary station that was added in Camarillo in 
mid-February has remained steady, at about 120 passengers each way. Ridership 
throughout the system has doubled to 18,500 since the Jan. 17 quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Funding from the Federal Emergency Management Agency will cover most of the 
$1.2-million cost of running the temporary Oxnard and Camarillo stops until 
October, or until the Simi Valley Freeway is repaired, whichever comes first. 
</P>
<P>
 For the Oxnard service, Metrolink is planning to run two round-trip trains a 
day from the Oxnard Transportation Center on 4th Street Mondays through 
Fridays. Trains will originate in Oxnard, with stops in Camarillo, Moorpark and 
Simi Valley before continuing on to the San Fernando Valley and downtown Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The trains will be stored in a temporary layover facility behind a citrus 
packing plant in Montalvo, about 1 1/2 miles from the Oxnard station. The 
commission agreed to spend $215,000 to build the temporary storage terminal, 
which will not be reimbursed with federal aid. 
</P>
<P>
 Addition of the Oxnard stop marks a triumph for local officials in their 
struggle to get emergency Metrolink service extended into western Ventura 
County. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is truly gratifying to see that this is finally happening," said 
Supervisor John K. Flynn, whose district includes Oxnard. "Now the big task is 
to make sure people ride the train." 
</P>
<P>
 Flynn said he was seeing to it that the arrival of Metrolink in Oxnard is 
well-advertised. 
</P>
<P>
 Flyers were sent out and notices posted around town, Flynn said. And he helped 
arrange for a message airplane to fly overhead informing residents of the new 
service. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll let people know, one way or another," Flynn said. Oxnard Metrolink 
Service 
</P>
<P>
 Where: Oxnard Transit Center, 200 E. 4th St., near Oxnard Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 When: Mondays through Fridays. 
</P>
<P>
 Times: Trains depart at 5:31 and 6:21 a.m. and return at 6:00 and 7:14 p.m., 
making nine stops between Oxnard and Los Angeles Union Station. The trip takes 
about 1 1/2 hours each way. 
</P>
<P>
 Parking: 300 free spaces. 
</P>
<P>
 Access: Trains are wheelchair-accessible. 
</P>
<P>
 Cost: A round-trip ticket to Burbank costs $12 and to Los Angeles $14. A 
monthly pass to Burbank is $176 and $208 to Los Angeles.

STREET SMART: CEMENT LUMPS MAY MEAN BUMPY RIDE ON VALLEY VISTA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SARA CATANIA, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 I drive down Valley Vista Drive every day to get to my home in Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
 About eight years ago, a liquid-cement carrier preceded me up the hill, 
leaving small deposits of cement on the roadway just south of Vista del Mar 
Avenue to Marine View Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 I've watched with fascination and wonder over the years to see how long it 
would take for these lumps to wear down. But they've managed to hold up pretty 
well. 
</P>
<P>
 Those of us who live up here have memorized where the lumps are and know how 
to drive around them. They don't seem to be a real danger, but I wonder if the 
city has noticed them or has any plan to remove them. 
</P>
<P>
 Marguerite Partridge 
</P>
<P>
 Camarillo 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Reader: 
</P>
<P>
 The stretch of Valley Vista you're referring to actually straddles the city of 
Camarillo and Ventura County, and neither has noticed the lumps. 
</P>
<P>
 Camarillo traffic engineer Tom Fox says he's never received complaints about 
the lumps but will check them out to make sure that they are not causing 
traffic problems. 
</P>
<P>
 County workers agreed to follow suit. 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 Could you clear up a source of confusion for my wife and me regarding flashing 
yellow lights? 
</P>
<P>
 My wife insists that if you approach an intersection with flashing yellow 
lights and there is cross traffic, you are supposed to stop. 
</P>
<P>
 I always thought that it was OK to keep on going without stopping. 
</P>
<P>
 Who's right? 
</P>
<P>
 Ben Perry 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Reader: 
</P>
<P>
 You are, as long as you slow down. 
</P>
<P>
 Flashing yellow lights at intersections are meant to warn motorists to slow 
down, according to Ventura's traffic signal systems brochure. 
</P>
<P>
 Obviously, you should stop if it looks like there is cross traffic breezing 
through the intersection. 
</P>
<P>
 For questions of general interest like this one, you may want to stop by 
Ventura City Hall and pick up the city's series of traffic information 
brochures. 
</P>
<P>
 Or you can call 654-7887 and ask the city to mail you a set. 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 Heading down Madera Road in Simi Valley recently, I discovered a U-turn policy 
that is frustrating and seems to make no sense. 
</P>
<P>
 I was driving east on Madera near Wood Ranch when I realized that I needed to 
turn around. 
</P>
<P>
 I drove to the intersection at Presidential Drive planning to make a U-turn. 
But much to my dismay, U-turns were not permitted. I found the same restriction 
at the next two intersections. 
</P>
<P>
 I don't understand why these signs are posted at every intersection. When 
there is no traffic coming, visibility is good and it seems like a U-turn would 
be very safe. 
</P>
<P>
 Why the restriction? 
</P>
<P>
 Dale Schaefer 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Reader: 
</P>
<P>
 The city of Simi Valley does not allow U-turns if there is no left-turn lane 
because motorists waiting to turn could cause traffic backups, says Ron Coons, 
Simi Valley's public works director. 
</P>
<P>
 Since there are no left-turn lanes at the two lights east of Presidential 
Drive -- Wood Ranch Parkway and Country Club Drive East -- U-turns are 
prohibited. 
</P>
<P>
 However, there is a left-turn lane at Presidential Drive, and Coons said the 
city will conduct a study to see if U-turns could be allowed.

EARLY EASTER; OUTDOOR SUNRISE SERVICE IN OJAI DRAWS THE FAITHFUL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF McDONALD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the pre-dawn darkness at Libbey Bowl, blanket-clad worshipers trickled in 
to the amphitheater, coffee cups in hand. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the end of Sunday's interdenominational sunrise service in Ojai, more 
than 100 people had assembled in a brisk chill to hear the Easter message 
delivered by Father Dennis Mulkey of the Ojai Valley Christian Center. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to get services done so I can go surfing," said Pat McCarthy, an 
Ojai electrician who brought his two daughters, Brie and Quinn, to Sunday's 
early-morning observance. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been coming the last couple of years," he said. "It's nice because they 
have all the churches here and not just one." 
</P>
<P>
 Across Ventura County, people celebrated Easter Sunday with a host of 
observances, egg hunts and other traditional events, filling churches and 
reflecting on what the holiday means to them. 
</P>
<P>
 "They really like to see the Easter bunny," said Jason Williamson, a volunteer 
dressed Sunday as the holiday hare and handing out scoops of chocolate eggs and 
jelly beans to excited children at St. Peter Claver Church in Simi Valley. "It 
enlightens them." 
</P>
<P>
 Williamson said the holiday gives children a chance to feed their imaginations 
while learning about tradition. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think kids are exposed too much to reality," he said. "They need to believe 
in fairy tales." 
</P>
<P>
 But the church egg hunt was no make-believe story. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousands of brightly colored eggs awaited hundreds of children after the 10 
a.m. service, although each child was limited to four eggs, which were 
exchanged for candy bars and other edible treasures. 
</P>
<P>
 Just behind the starting line of the 8- to 10-year-old section, Michelle 
Skinner of Simi Valley waited with her 9-year-old son, Jeremy, for the mad dash 
to begin. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not the candy," she said. "It's the fun of trying to get out there and 
get those eggs. It's the mad dash to the eggs, and then to get the candy." 
</P>
<P>
 Nearby, Tricia Stoller scanned the crowd, seeking out her two boys, 
Christopher, 6, and Thomas, 3. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even Christmas doesn't get like this," she said, referring to the sheer 
numbers of camera-clutching parents and sweets-seeking youngsters dressed in 
their Sunday best. "This is a really big crowd." 
</P>
<P>
 For Jennifer Wilkins, 10, of Simi Valley, Sunday's Easter egg hunt was her 
last. Next year, she will be over the age limit, but that didn't concern her 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "You get four eggs and you get a handful of candy," Jennifer said. 
</P>
<P>
 But she also knew the true spirit of Easter. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a time for loving your family," she said, slipping a hand into her 
3-year-old sister's basket of candy. 
</P>
<P>
 At Libbey Bowl, where roosters crowed between the lessons of Mulkey, Chester 
Perry of Ojai listened closely. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been coming here for years," said Perry, an Ojai Valley mortician. "It's 
a celebration of the Resurrection of Jesus and, in my business, it's nice to 
have faith. I see a lot of death, and this represents life to me." 
</P>
<P>
 K. K. Chase, a sales representative from Ojai, said she had never experienced 
so intimate a sunrise service, which was attended by more than 100 people. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was nice to be outside for a change," she said of the event. "And it's 
nice to hear other pastors and be in a service where there are other faiths." 
</P>
<P>
 Chase, who said it was her first time at the outdoor service, listened to the 
sermon as squirrels darted across tree branches enshrouding the amphitheater 
and dogs lay quietly by their owners. 
</P>
<P>
 "Usually it's sunny and warm, so I'm not used to having rain," Chase said. 
"But the animals and roosters are part of the chain. It's part of Ojai." 
</P>
<P>
 Fred and Nancy Bull of Sun City, visiting their children and grandchildren in 
Ojai, said they found the early-morning sermon uplifting. 
</P>
<P>
 "I liked the message of the Resurrection and what that's all about," said 
Bull, who came to the service with Squeaky, a charcoal-black Shetland sheep 
dog. 
</P>
<P>
 "She came to pray, too," he said of the family pet.

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; STUDENTS PLAN TO GROW FOOD FOR HOMELESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAY SAILLANT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was a school holiday for students at Buena High School in Ventura, but 
senior Beth Denger remained on campus, sweating lightly under a warm sky as she 
raked a freshly turned row of dirt. 
</P>
<P>
 Amid a backdrop of rusty scrap metal, overgrown brush, knee-high weeds and 
dilapidated sheds, Beth, 17, and three other Buena High students toiled, 
pulling weeds, hoeing dirt and mounding the soil into rows. 
</P>
<P>
 Before Friday was over, the students planned to turn this forgotten, gritty 
section of Buena's campus into a community garden. 
</P>
<P>
 Their hope, Beth said, is to eventually grow enough vegetables on the 
quarter-acre of land to feed dozens of homeless families. 
</P>
<P>
 The group of energetic and idealistic students, many of them members of the 
school's Associated Student Body, also hope to teach environmental awareness by 
using organic methods to grow foods and to set up a composting bin. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to make this garden a part of the community and Buena High for years 
to come," said Beth, who plans to pursue a degree in agriculture when she 
graduates this spring. 
</P>
<P>
 "We hope to really impact people's lives and let them know it is possible to 
grow vegetables and to be environmentally aware." 
</P>
<P>
 Beth got the idea to plant a garden tended by students as she walked by the 
run-down greenhouses and sheds last year. As part of the campus's defunct 
agriculture department, the area had not been used for growing for at least a 
decade. Shop classes had claimed some sheds and outdoor areas for storing scrap 
metal, which is in haphazard piles. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought it was really ugly," she said. "I didn't understand why it had to 
look so trashy. And the unused land really bothered me." 
</P>
<P>
 So Beth, who has gardened in her back yard since childhood, made a plan. Beth 
and another senior, Robin Levy, created an eight-page proposal for Ventura's 
school board, suggesting that the old ag department plots be transformed into a 
community garden. 
</P>
<P>
 After winning approval from the school board, the pair then sent out flyers 
asking students to sign up to tend to row crops. About 14 students have signed 
up, and each will be in charge of about two rows of crops. 
</P>
<P>
 The students plan to grow lettuce, tomatoes, corn, jalapeno peppers, cilantro, 
green onions and zucchini, among other things. 
</P>
<P>
 "We tried to think of things that would be easy to grow, so the students 
wouldn't kill them," Beth said. "And things that people like to eat because we 
will be giving all of our food to Project Understanding," a Ventura charity 
that feeds the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
 The hard part, Beth admits, is making sure the garden continues to thrive once 
she and other organizers have graduated. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have young people like Reina (Centeno)," she said, gesturing to a 
15-year-old sophomore busy planting tomatoes. "We want to keep them involved so 
they will keep this going." KAY SAILLANT

<P>
 Ventura city leaders tonight are expected to request bids for a street 
construction project that officials say is key to their plans to revitalize 
downtown. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials are scheduled to send out for bids on revamping Figueroa Street 
between Santa Clara Street and Thompson Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's one of the three primary connecting streets between downtown and the 
ocean," said Pat Richardson, who oversees the city's revitalization efforts. 
"The whole intent of our downtown revitalization is to connect our downtown to 
the ocean." 
</P>
<P>
 The block-long stretch of Figueroa will be entirely redone. It will be 
narrowed, and new sidewalks, street lighting, traffic signals and palm trees 
will be added. 
</P>
<P>
 Construction on the project, estimated to cost $447,000, is scheduled to begin 
in May and be completed in August, Richardson said. PEGGY Y. LEE

<P>
 Ventura County's largest water supplier will hold a public hearing on 
maintaining a $5 annual service fee it began charging customers last year. 
</P>
<P>
 The board of the Calleguas Municipal Water District, which started charging 
the fee to help cover service costs, agreed at its meeting this week to hold a 
hearing to solicit public input on keeping the fee. 
</P>
<P>
 Calleguas serves nearly 500,000 residents and commercial customers in Simi 
Valley, Thousand Oaks, Moorpark, Camarillo and Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 The hearing is scheduled May 31 at Cal Lutheran University's Preus-Brandt 
Forum, 50 W. Olsen Road, Thousand Oaks. SARA CATANIA

<P>
 The Simi Valley Youth Employment Service is seeking businesses willing to 
participate in its eighth annual job fair. 
</P>
<P>
 The fair, scheduled May 7, is intended to help 16- to 22-year-olds find jobs 
and learn about careers, coordinator Sandra Thompson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Young people get a chance to ask questions and learn about different 
possibilities, and employers get a chance to do some hiring," she said. "It 
works out well for everyone." 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, about 50 employers and 1,000 youths attended the fair, Thompson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Employers range from retail clothing and fast-food chains to large 
corporations and government agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 For information on participating in the job fair, call Thompson at 522-HIRE.

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; YOUTHS' DISPUTE LEADS TO GUNFIRE

<P>
 A verbal dispute between two groups of teen-agers escalated into gunfire early 
Easter Sunday as two of the youths were driving away from the scene, 
investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
 Two 17-year-olds from Thousand Oaks were driving west on Lynn Road at Avenida 
de las Floras about 3 a.m. Sunday when they heard between one and four shots 
fired at them from behind, sheriff's deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
 A bullet pierced their car, passed through a headrest and grazed the scalp of 
one of the boys, deputies said. The youth, whose name was not released because 
of his age, was treated at Los Robles Regional Medical Center and released, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators said a dispute between the pair and another group of four or 
five juveniles provoked the shooting. All are believed to be involved in gangs, 
according to deputies. 
</P>
<P>
 Police are looking for the suspects, who fled west on Lynn Road in a black 
car, authorities said. JEFF McDONALD

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: MOORPARK; FREE CPR TRAINING OFFERED TO RESIDENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The city of Moorpark and the Ventura County Fire Protection District will hold 
a free CPR awareness training session in both English and Spanish on May 7 at 
the Moorpark Community Center. 
</P>
<P>
 The half-day "Start-a-Heart" program is intended to provide basic 
cardiopulmonary resuscitation training to Moorpark residents. 
</P>
<P>
 "They won't be certified to do CPR, but people will get enough training to 
possibly save a life," Moorpark City Councilman Scott Montgomery said. 
</P>
<P>
 For those interested in completing the eight-hour course for CPR 
certification, the Pruner ambulance company will also be conducting a class at 
the event. Along with the training classes, there will be puppet shows teaching 
children basic fire safety and first aid, and the sheriff's deputies who serve 
Moorpark will be on hand to provide fingerprinting for children. SCOTT HADLY

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; WORK UNDER WAY ON NEW AUTO MALL SIGN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATTHEW MOSK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Construction of the fiercely contested Thousand Oaks Auto Mall sign has begun 
with the recent installment of a support structure along the Ventura Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 Sign designer Scott Bailey of Newbury Park-based Signature Signs said work on 
the 20-foot-tall display officially got under way three weeks ago and will be 
completed in June. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not your average sign," Bailey said. "There's a lot more to it." 
</P>
<P>
 The sign, which was the focus of several months of vocal debate in the City 
Council, is the product of a compromise between the auto mall and nearby 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Bailey said the stucco-and-tile structure will include five terraced planters 
with live plants, an irrigation system, an energy-efficient temperature and 
time display, and the globe logo for the auto mall. 
</P>
<P>
 The sign board, he said, will not be much different in size from the existing 
274-square-foot brown and white sign that it replaces. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think when people finally see it, they will say to themselves, 'Oh, this is 
not such a big deal after all,' " Bailey said. MATTHEW MOSK

CORRECTIONS OFFICIALS PUSH DETENTION PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TINA DAUNT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Corrections officials are moving forward with plans to place a small group of 
low-security inmates on house arrest by monitoring their actions with 
electronic bracelets. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials will ask the Ventura County Board of Supervisors to approve a 
six-month pilot project to monitor 20 offenders, now serving time for drunk 
driving and minor drug charges in the county's work-furlough program. 
</P>
<P>
 As with the furlough program, bracelet-wearers will be allowed to go to a job 
or school, but if they leave home at other times, a radio signal will alert 
probation officers. 
</P>
<P>
 County officials hope that the electronic device will help reduce the cost of 
housing and supervising inmates. 
</P>
<P>
 "The pilot program is viewed as a proactive approach to community 
corrections," said Frank C. Woodson, director of the county's Correctional 
Services Agency. "Many jurisdictions across the state have found that home 
detention is an effective approach to low-risk offenders." TINA DAUNT

ORANGE COUNTY VOICES; 'THREE STRIKES' AND WE'RE ALL OUT OF LUCK; POLITICS: 
LOCAL IMPACT OF ANTI-CRIME LEGISLATION SEEMS LIKE AN IRISH STEW, BUT IT'S 
TROUBLESOME ENOUGH TO MAKE YOU WANT AN IRISH WHISKEY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEITH BOYUM, Keith Boyum is a professor of political science at Cal State 
Fullerton. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Perhaps it's a subconscious desire to extend St. Patrick's Day -- but the 
local impact of "three strikes" legislation (designed to put repeat felons away 
more or less for life) seems to me like a good Irish stew. A wonderful variety 
of political vegetables contribute. 
</P>
<P>
 Floating on the surface is an apparently substantial meat-and-potatoes 
response to Orange County's (and the rest of the state's) hunger for less 
crime. Yet consider that just two days before St. Patrick's Day, and about a 
week after "three strikes" legislation was signed into law, Atty. Gen. Dan 
Lungren announced that crimes reported to California police had taken a 
nose-dive last year. Even more remarkable: Reports of crimes to California 
police have been heading down for a decade, while victim surveys (as opposed to 
reports of crime) have shown American crime rates slumping for more than two 
decades. 
</P>
<P>
 Near-unanimously, furthermore, criminologists doubt that "three strikes" will 
make a difference in the frequency even of the most violent of criminal 
offenses. Consider, they say, that we are not seeking to deter middle-aged guys 
with mortgages -- but instead asocial youth for whom a felony conviction puts 
at risk no such stake in society. 
</P>
<P>
 And then there is the cost -- an onion strong enough to make grown-ups weep. 
Billions of dollars for prison construction are apparently needed in the next 
five to 10 years, and the billion or two annually that would be required to 
operate them would kick in by decade's end; and those dollars would come atop a 
corrections' budget that's already the state's fastest-growing. (Some of the 
weeping is from higher education, which most observers think will lose money to 
the prisons' budget). 
</P>
<P>
 Now let's add some political parsnips, turnips, carrots and leeks. Try term 
limits, tax anathema, base closures and political pork. 
</P>
<P>
 Absolutely without impugning anybody's motives, we may note that this is the 
kind of politics least likely to be mistaken for statesmanship. It's benefit 
now, pay later, quite like deficit spending in Washington. This crop of 
legislators will in many instances have departed Sacramento before the piper 
must be fully paid. Proposition 140's term limits contribute that parsnip to 
our stew. 
</P>
<P>
 Tax anathema turnips grow astonishingly well in Orange County, and, with few 
exceptions, both local leadership and Sacramento representatives are proud of 
it. Because Californians, with Orange County in the vanguard, want new prisons 
without any increase in taxes to pay for them, the money will have to be 
redirected from current state programs and services. When it is, look for those 
whose favorite programs are cut to show little sympathy when Orange County 
feels the pinch. 
</P>
<P>
 Add now to the stew that fine Irish carrot, base closures. Recall that Irvine 
and Mission Viejo are not exactly crazy about the Musick Honor Farm, and that 
much political blood has been spilled over the location of a new county jail. 
One might reasonably expect that Orange County would want someone else to host 
a state pen. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet it's easy to imagine angry legislators from other counties taking delight 
in sticking a prison to Orange County, hotbed of pro-incarceration, anti-tax 
sentiment. There is little political cover, either. Our state legislators (save 
one), like all of our members of Congress, sit with the Republican minority, 
while Democrats hold the White House. If a Democrat -- or a Pete Wilson too 
weakened, too inattentive, or unhappy with Orange County conservatives -- were 
to round out the picture, the stage would be set for a local prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, it may not happen. Other towns in the state may decide they want 
the steady source of jobs and wages that a prison brings. 
</P>
<P>
 In that instance, the local losses to "three strikes" may be more nearly 
proportionate to losses in the rest of the state. Like 57 other counties, 
Orange would have fewer roads, fewer college students, fewer opportunities for 
civil litigation (as court congestion predictably grows), shorter rations for 
public schools, poorer public health and more homeless. 
</P>
<P>
 Three strikes and we're out, poorer alongside the rest of California, whether 
we're home to a state penitentiary or not. It's enough to make a man want not 
an Irish stew, but an Irish whiskey instead.

FORMER REAGAN AIDE ADMITS ADDICTIONS; PEOPLE: ECONOMIST AND WALL STREET STAR 
LARRY KUDLOW SAYS HE'S RECOVERING. HE WAS A LEADING PROPONENT OF 'SUPPLY-SIDE' 
ECONOMICS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Larry Kudlow, whose meteoric Wall Street career led to a post as adviser to 
President Ronald Reagan, now admits he's a recovering alcoholic and drug 
addict. 
</P>
<P>
 The conservative economist says he's been sober for more than a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Getting high helped him deal with work demands, he told the New York Times. 
</P>
<P>
 "You think you're a superman, you think you can do anything," Kudlow said in a 
story published Sunday. "I felt invincible and that there were no limits as to 
how late I could stay up or how much I could travel. Today, I see how tough it 
was." 
</P>
<P>
 Kudlow, 46, was the strategist behind the tax-cut plan that helped propel 
Christie Whitman to an upset victory in the New Jersey governor's race last 
year. He advises other Republicans such as Jack Kemp and Rush Limbaugh. 
</P>
<P>
 After Reagan was elected in 1980, Kudlow was named chief economist at the 
Office of Management and Budget under David Stockman. He was a leading 
proponent of "supply-side economics" -- tax cuts aimed at stimulating economic 
growth. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he began drinking regularly in the late 1970s and then began using 
illegal drugs, which he wouldn't name. 
</P>
<P>
 Fifteen months ago he took time off work from his Wall Street job to enter a 
drug rehabilitation program. He attends a program for recovering addicts as 
often as twice a day, and he fears a relapse. 
</P>
<P>
 "I live my life day to day," he said tearfully. 
</P>
<P>
 Now working for National Review magazine, the former Wall Street whiz has been 
touted as a potential U.S. Senate candidate or Cabinet member if a conservative 
like Kemp were elected president. 
</P>
<P>
 His aspirations are on hold, but he's not ruling out a political career. 
</P>
<P>
 "In our society there are a lot of people who have suffered from alcohol or 
substance abuse -- you name it -- and society has been understanding," he said.

COUNTERPUNCH: A THUMBS UP FOR THIS OSCAR-NIGHT PERFORMANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROGER EBERT, Roger Ebert is the film critic of the Chicago Sun-Times and is 
co-host of the syndicated television show Siskel & Ebert. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Howard Rosenberg disapproves of me in his column ("The Eberts: The New Awards 
for Fawning," Calendar, March 23) for co-hosting KABC's pre-Oscar interview 
show -- and, worse, for adopting a "fawning," "avuncular" tone toward the 
nominees and other stars. Such is not an appropriate role, he finds, for a film 
critic. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosenberg is an excellent reporter and has accurately described my 
performance. I have no disagreement, except when he writes that I am short. I 
am fully 5 feet, 9 1/2 inches tall. He leaves me with two questions to be 
answered: (1) Was my behavior appropriate? and (2) Was it appropriate for a 
film critic? 
</P>
<P>
 The format of such broadcasts is, as Rosenberg knows, well-established. The 
movie stars parade down the red carpet toward the Pavilion. They are accosted 
by hundreds of television, radio and print journalists and photographers from 
all over the world, who engage in a feeding frenzy. The tone is set by Army 
Archerd's loudspeaker interviews for the fans in the bleachers. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In 26 years on the movie beat, I have seen uncounted red-carpet encounters. 
Without exception, they consist of rapid-fire exchanges of inanities, cliches 
and unfinished thoughts. What the interviewer hopes is to be slightly less 
inane and more thoughtful than the situation requires. This is not easy. The 
typical interview consists of 10 to 45 seconds of shouting. 
</P>
<P>
 The Academy Awards are a party and a celebration -- not an appropriate place 
for the sorts of probing, lacerating questions Rosenberg did not hear me asking 
("Miss Hunter, would you agree with me that your nomination for 'The Firm' was 
the academy's worst single nomination this year?"). Just as one does not make 
rude remarks at a wedding, one adopts a lighthearted spirit on Oscar day. Much 
depends on tone. When I asked Nancy Kerrigan, "Do you think you might want to 
move in the direction of acting rather than skating?" Rosenberg apparently 
thought I was being perfectly serious. This does not say much for his sense of 
humor. 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, I was certainly avuncular. But fawning? This is a pejorative word 
depending upon whose ox is being gored. In my opinion, my performance was 
uncannily appropriate for the occasion. 
</P>
<P>
 But should a film critic engage in such public behavior? Or should he stay 
aloof from the melee? The ridiculous, goofy, silly side of the Oscars has 
always appealed to me, and when KABC asked me to co-host the pre-Oscar 
broadcast, I was tickled. (Money, believe me, did not play a role in my 
decision.) 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It was my chance to participate in a Hollywood ritual. I did not, it is true, 
lacerate the arriving guests with my scorn for their failures, or my doubts 
about the wisdom of their nomination. But neither did I lie. And I had a jolly 
good time. 
</P>
<P>
 Big, rich papers like the Los Angeles Times separate their critics from those 
who write interviews and profiles. Rosenberg need never actually meet those he 
writes about. He can consider them as abstractions. I not only review movies, 
but I also do interviews, visit locations and attend festivals (paying my own 
way, of course -- not accepting junkets). I never have any difficulty in 
telling the truth about a movie, even if I've interviewed one of its 
participants. 
</P>
<P>
 Writing a truthful review is what a critic does. But I am not only a film 
critic. I am also an interviewer, a raconteur, a friend, a fan, a gossip, a 
teller of jokes, a teacher of classes, a writer of books, a sketcher of 
pictures, a host of pre-Oscar telecasts. I am even on line. I am large, Mr. 
Rosenberg. I contain multitudes.

COUNTERPUNCH: BULLISH ON LUKE PERRY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLEY O'TOOLE, Lesley O'Toole is a Los Angeles-based entertainment 
journalist who works for newspapers and magazines in Britain and elsewhere. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Luke Perry's movie about real-life world champion bull rider Lane Frost may 
not be a great movie but, as a British ex-patriate who had never clapped eyes 
on a bull rider (real or on celluloid), let alone heard of Lane Frost, I found 
"8 Seconds" fascinating, inspirational and moving. Hell, I cried. 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Rainer classified Perry's Frost as a "cardboard good guy" and said he 
"never sinks low enough to make his rise exciting" (" '8 Seconds': This True 
Rodeo Story Lacks True Grit," Calendar, Feb. 25). In fact, he's alternately 
gutless, arrogant and idiotic for much of the movie. Perry's portrayal is 
uncomfortably unflattering in places and his widow, Kellie, should be 
congratulated for allowing Perry to publicize the seamier side of her late 
husband. Nor does the evidence show that Kellie was what Rainer calls a 
"stand-by-your-man sweetheart," in real life or as played by Cynthia Geary. 
</P>
<P>
 Rainer finds fault with the film's "processed" heartbreak. Processed? This is 
a true story. Sure, the film's major downfall is its over-sugary script; let's 
face it, schmaltzy lovers' talk is enough to make the soppiest of us cringe. 
</P>
<P>
 I also would like to mention James Rebhorn's role as Frost's undemonstrative 
father. Contrary to the review, I thought his increasing displeasure as Frost 
sweats his way to the world championship was not intended to be viewed as a 
peculiar expression of paternal love. He was more like a father who resented 
Lane's following in his own long-gone, champion bull-riding hoof marks. 
</P>
<P>
 The story of Lane Frost has obviously been a labor of love for Perry, and an 
important test of his acting skills. He has never been stretched like this on 
"Beverly Hills, 90210" and clearly he can act. His Western cowboy drawl is also 
consistent and eons away from the TV show's Dylan McKay. More impressive, 
though, is the fact that Perry spent months learning to ride bulls for the 
film. No stunt doubles for him, it's all real, and dangerous to boot. 
</P>
<P>
 Perry has guts and a big heart. I interviewed him recently at the film's 
international press junket. His eyes welled with tears and he was so choked he 
couldn't speak. The real Kellie Frost had just told him she loved the movie; 
that he'd got Lane Frost spot-on. He said that was all that mattered. 
</P>
<P>
 Making it in the movies is tough, so give the guy a break and, if not credit, 
at least full marks for effort.

COUNTERPUNCH: A WORLD SANS ROUNDTABLES? NOT FUNNY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN KIRSCHENBAUM, Alan Kirschenbaum is co-executive producer of Coach and 
has been a writer-producer on other sitcoms, including Down the Shore, Anything

 Eliminate the table?! No more sitting around with the funniest people you 
know, tasting each other's food and trying to make each other laugh?! Sounds 
like a sad day in the comedy world to me ("TV: Squaring Off Against 'Roundtable 
Writing,' " Calendar, March 14). 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, at the Museum of Broadcasting tribute to Sid Caesar held at the L.A. 
County Museum, a packed audience sat for hours, enraptured, as the greatest 
writing staff ever assembled swapped stories about the days of "Your Show of 
Shows," when a dozen or so voices tried to outshout each other, outjoke each 
other, outlaugh each other. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 One after another, Carl Reiner, Mel Brooks, Larry Gelbart, Sid Caesar and Neil 
Simon, for whom this was his first real job, described the time spent in the 
rewrite room as the best of their creative lives. Audiences attending Simon's 
"Laughter on the 23rd Floor," currently running in New York, are convulsed into 
hysterics on a nightly basis by the competition, camaraderie and hilarity that 
takes place in the single setting, the rewrite room. 
</P>
<P>
 I've worked on sitcoms for the past six years, and my most treasured times, as 
the "Your Show of Shows" writers before me, are of being in the room, around 
the table. I moved to Los Angeles, in 1988, on a Sunday, and began my first 
job, as the lowest writer on the ladder on "Dear John," on Monday. I was 
fortunate enough to spend the next year studying with a wonderful mentor, the 
prolific Ed Weinberger. I soaked up the brilliant joke rhythms of legends like 
Bob Ellison and David Lloyd. I absorbed the ambitious new ideas of new wave 
writers who believed that sitcom didn't have to be shticky and jokey, but more 
reflective of real life, writers like Peter Noah and Bob Stevens. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps "Dear John" will never be honored with a retrospective at a museum, 
but at least I know now that I have one thing in common with Neil Simon: 
Whatever I know about comedy writing, I learned in the room, around the table. 
</P>
<P>
 This year on "Coach," I work with a wonderful group of people. I come to work, 
I laugh. We have long story sessions, I laugh. I go to run-through each 
afternoon, and I laugh. We order food, and go into the rewrite room and sit 
around a table, and whether the rewrite lasts an hour or all day, one thing is 
guaranteed: I laugh. 
</P>
<P>
 Where is the romance in sitting alone in an office, banging out a draft? Where 
is the enjoyment in eating only what you've ordered? And, as network executives 
are so fond of asking, where are the laughs?

 RAIDS STAMPED OUT: Smarting from bad publicity, the U.S. Postal Service has 
stopped raiding businesses to check up on their use of Federal Express and 
other commercial overnight delivery services. . . . A little-known provision of 
postal law permits delivery companies to transport only "urgent material," and 
the Postal Service has the power to protect its monopoly by deciding what 
constitutes "urgent." In the last five years, postal inspectors have marched 
into 41 businesses and collected more than $1 million in "postage due" from 
companies that allegedly sent non-urgent mail by express service. When 
Atlanta-based Equifax Inc. and other raided companies protested against 
"bullying tactics," Sen. Paul Coverdell (R-Ga.) and Rep. Fred Upton (R-Mich.) 
pressed legislation to ban the audits. . . . That and a flurry of news reports 
prompted Postmaster General Marvin T. Runyon Jr. to call a halt. "It's very bad 
for us from a public relations standpoint," he told a Senate panel. . . . But 
the controversy is still bubbling: The General Accounting Office, the 
investigative arm of Congress, is probing private mailers' impact on Postal 
Service revenue.

 LEARNING FROM JERSEY: As they look ahead to the 1994 campaign, Democratic 
strategists are looking back at what they believe was an important lesson from 
last November's New Jersey gubernatorial election. One reason for incumbent 
Democrat James J. Florio's defeat was the relatively low turnout of black 
voters, which Democrats attribute in good measure to lackluster registration 
and get-out-the-vote efforts in inner-city wards. In some precincts, the black 
vote was off by as much as 10% from Florio's 1989 victory. "The rule to 
remember is that, in a close election, you can't afford to take black votes for 
granted," said Don Sweitzer, the Democratic Party's political director. . . . 
Democrats downplay claims that Republican consultant Edward J. Rollins paid off 
black ministers to suppress the black vote. The real problem, analysts said, 
was that Florio focused his campaign more on winning back middle-class white 
voters infuriated by his tax hikes than on courting minorities.

 COUP BREWING? Growing Democratic grumbling threatens House Banking Committee 
Chairman Henry B. Gonzalez (D-Tex.), who could face the sort of coup that in 
1974 dethroned the panel's last peppery populist, the late Wright Patman of 
Texas. Gonzalez's heavy-handed attack on Rep. Jim Leach, the Iowa Republican 
who has been demanding hearings on the Whitewater controversy, "was merely 
symptomatic of an old man who takes on high-profile issues but is totally inept 
at focusing his committee on critical economic policies," said a top aide to 
House Democratic leaders. . . . An eccentric loner, Gonzalez won high praise 
from Democrats for probing the savings and loan scandal and the U.S.-aided arms 
buildup of Iraq. But his banking panel did little work on the makeup of 
financial institutions as the nation reeled through four years of economic 
chaos. . . . "He'll face a strong challenge at the (Democratic) caucus" in 
December, a colleague predicted.

STREET SMART: LETTER LEADS TO NEW SIGNS ON UNIVERSITY FOR MACARTHUR APPROACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROLINE LEMKE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 The small signs marking entry onto MacArthur Boulevard from University Drive 
are totally inadequate for both north and southbound traffic. The signs are 
placed too close to their respective ramps to give enough advance notice of the 
imminent turnoff, and they are not clearly legible even at close range. 
</P>
<P>
 Since these signs are markers for a major artery, they should be made twice 
their present size, in a more visible color, and be placed well ahead in the 
path of approach -- with an additional arrow at the entrance of each ramp -- 
for the benefit of drivers who are unfamiliar with this route. 
</P>
<P>
 Carol Benedicktus 
</P>
<P>
 San Clemente 
</P>
<P>
 On the strength of your letter, Irvine's traffic engineers checked out the 
signs on University Drive at MacArthur Boulevard. Investigators agreed with 
your assessment that advance signs are needed on University Drive and that the 
lettering on one of the existing signs is small. 
</P>
<P>
 A work order has been submitted and new advance signs alerting drivers to the 
MacArthur Boulevard approach will be erected within the next two months, said 
Bonnie Burton, senior transportation analyst for Irvine. Burton's department 
also contacted Newport Beach's traffic engineering department and they agreed 
to install advance signs in their right-of-way for southbound MacArthur 
Boulevard, Burton said. 
</P>
<P>
 There's no denying that the lettering is small on the sign that reads 
"MacArthur northbound." Again, you were correct in assuming that the letters 
are half the size of other street name signs around the city. But there are no 
plans to change it, Burton said. 
</P>
<P>
 The actual sign meets Irvine's standards for the size of street name signs, 
Burton said. Its lettering is smaller to fit in all the essential wording. 
</P>
<P>
 On most street name signs in the city, the last name of the street is omitted 
to make the lettering as large as possible, Burton said. For example, instead 
of "Culver Drive" the sign simply reads "Culver." 
</P>
<P>
 But if "northbound" were dropped from the MacArthur sign, drivers might go 
south, Burton said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart:  
</P>
<P>
 I have been a resident of Orange County for 15 years and a commuting resident 
for six years. I would like to take this opportunity to point out two 
particular traffic intersection lights that make commuting unnecessarily 
stressful and long for everyone. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether traveling north or south on Culver Drive in Irvine, the traffic lights 
at the intersections of Culver and Irvine Center Drive and Culver and Deerfield 
Avenue are of an incredibly long duration. 
</P>
<P>
 These streets (Irvine Center Drive and Deerfield Avenue) that run 
perpendicular to Culver have traffic lights that change when there is 
absolutely no one waiting to cross Culver. 
</P>
<P>
 The flashing walk signal will also change, thus making the wait to continue 
down Culver even longer when there is no one waiting. Whether it is the middle 
of the day or at 2 a.m., these lights will change for an extended period of 
time even when no one is waiting at the lights.  
</P>
<P>
 I realize that with the addition of the Irvine Ranch Market there are more 
people in that shopping center, and with the construction on Culver that these 
may be the reasons why these lights change with the frequency that they do. I 
also realize that technology is available to adjust the timers at these lights 
and I would recommend that a review be done to alter these two particular ones. 
</P>
<P>
 While construction is going on, there is no sense in making commuting more 
difficult than it needs to be. 
</P>
<P>
 Whitney Amspacher 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine 
</P>
<P>
 Yours is not the only letter Street Smart has received recently about the 
signal coordination at these two intersections. And if you are looking for some 
relief because the surrounding construction is so stressful, keep looking. It's 
the construction that's causing the problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Wiring that connects the traffic signals had to be dismantled just north of 
Deerfield and Culver, making it impossible for traffic engineers to coordinate 
the traffic signals on Culver in that area, said Bonnie Burton of Irvine's 
traffic engineering department. The only part of Culver Drive that has signal 
coordination is between Deerfield to the south and Walnut Avenue to the north, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 What also must be remembered is that these are big intersections, with six 
through lanes, three right-turn lanes and dual left lanes in each direction, 
Burton said. Pedestrians must have time to cross all that.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: NEWPORT BEACH; STORYTELLING EVENTS TO MARK LIBRARY WEEK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The city's library system will celebrate National Library Week later this 
month with a series of storytelling programs for children. 
</P>
<P>
 The events are designed to encourage youngsters to read more and highlight the 
variety of children's books available at the libraries, said Judy Kelley, 
Newport Beach's youth services manager. 
</P>
<P>
 "Studies show that children who are read to become readers later in life," 
Kelley said. "This helps them appreciate the written word." 
</P>
<P>
 Professional storyteller and puppeteer Barbara Klein will be at the Corona del 
Mar Branch Library at 10:30 a.m. April 19, singing and reading stories. Klein 
will be at the Newport Center Branch Library at 10:30 a.m. April 20. Her 
program is designed for preschoolers. 
</P>
<P>
 Storyteller and musician Merrick Rees Hamer will read from Bill Peet's

20 at the Mariners Branch Library. He will be at the Balboa Branch Library at 
3:30 p.m. April 21. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is very dramatic . . . very musical," Kelley said. "He brings the children 
into it." Hamer's program is for elementary school students.

LAKERS THINKING PLAYOFFS AFTER HOLDING OFF HAWKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HOWARD-COOPER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 What's the rush? 
</P>
<P>
 The Lakers are obviously in no hurry to miss the playoffs after 17 consecutive 
appearances. They climbed into legitimate contention Sunday night after dumping 
another title contender in a 102-89 victory over the Atlanta Hawks at the Forum 
as the Denver Nuggets lost at Phoenix, cutting the Nuggets' lead for the final 
spot to 3 1/2 games with 11 to play. That includes two head-to-head meetings, 
starting Friday at the Forum.  
</P>
<P>
 Their coach, Magic Johnson, is suddenly in no hurry either. He conceded for 
the first time that he originally had no intention of staying beyond the end of 
this season when he first took the job, but his emotions are making a U-turn. 
No decision yet, and probably none for weeks, but he's already talking 
privately about what alterations he would like to make in 1994-95. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm fond of the players," he said. "They won me over. I was thinking, 
'Sixteen (games) and get me out.' Now, I might not want to leave. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be tough leaving. I thought it would be easy to do, getting 
out. Now I say we've come a long way. This is going to be a good team. We're 
playing well. I hope it's going to continue." 
</P>
<P>
 If it does, the Nuggets have reason to be worried. 
</P>
<P>
 "They should be," Nick Van Exel said after making four of six three-point 
attempts to break the team single-season record en route to 16 points and 10 
assists. 
</P>
<P>
 Anything else? 
</P>
<P>
 "The No. 1 seed should be worried, too." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Johnson, asked point blank if the Lakers are going to make the playoffs: 
"I'm thinking we are. I told them (the players) I think we're going to be 
there." 
</P>
<P>
 To emphasize the point, captain James Worthy called a team meeting for earlier 
in the day to second the notion. Then, with updated scores from the Nugget-Sun 
game being posted regularly, the Lakers started to pull away in the second 
quarter of their third contest against a division leader or co-leader in four 
nights. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hawks came in having won seven of their last nine, then fell behind, 
42-33, in the second quarter. Van Exel supplied that cushion with a 
three-pointer from the left side with 4:54 remaining, a shot that came with an 
exclamation. It pushed him past Johnson for the Laker record for three-point 
baskets, at 107. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lakers were up by the same nine points as late as 46-37, before settling 
for a 50-43 halftime advantage after making 52.3% of their first-half shots. 
Elden Campbell, continuing his recent strong play, already had 13 points and 
eight rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 When Van Exel and Campbell continued to make big contributions in the third 
quarter, the Lakers continued to extend the lead. Another three-pointer by Van 
Exel made for the first double-digit cushion, 53-43. Two possessions later, he 
drove the lane and dished off to Vlade Divac for a layin and a 12-point lead.  
</P>
<P>
 Campbell's turn. He blocked a shot by Adam Keefe, then went to the other end 
and tipped in a miss by George Lynch. About a minute later, he swatted away 
Duane Ferrell's shot, which the Lakers converted into a layup by Tony Smith as 
the lead went to 66-48. 
</P>
<P>
 The drawback for the Lakers was that the play cost them Campbell for the night 
after he was inadvertently hit in the eye. After getting 17 points, 10 rebounds 
and four blocked shots -- all team highs -- in only 27 minutes, he went to the 
hospital suffering from double vision. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Lakers needed a push to finish the third quarter, they got it from 
their coach . . . literally. Wanting to make an impromptu substitution with 19 
seconds to play, Johnson summoned Van Exel off the bench and, as the rookie 
guard headed to the scorer's table, gave him a push in the back that almost 
knocked Van Exel over. 
</P>
<P>
 The crowd roared and Johnson laughed along. He could afford to. All Van Exel 
did was go in and drill a three-pointer from in front of the Hawk bench with 
one second left, good for a 78-60 lead.

SHOP TALK: CLIENT'S NO BABY-SITTER FOR HOME BUSINESSWOMAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Shop Talk, a feature beginning today, is a forum for readers to ask 
questions about on-the-job situations and get answers from specialists on 
workplace issues. This week's experts are Ron Riggio, professor of industrial 
and organizational psychology at Cal State Fullerton; Tom Mayes, professor of 
management, Cal State Fullerton; and Elizabeth Winfree Lydon, Orange County 
regional manager and senior staff consultant for the Employers Group. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Question: I recently did business with a woman who runs a small company out of 
her home. Her school-age children were home on vacation, and they kept 
interrupting to have snacks fixed, shoes tied and fights settled. The mother 
seemed to think that clients should put up with this, but I felt that my time 
and money were being wasted. How could I have handled this? 
</P>
<P>
 -- J.G., Mission Viejo 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: Because you are paying for this woman's services, you are in control 
of the situation. You can voice your displeasure in a constructive way. Tell 
her that you find the situation not conducive to transacting your business. You 
can suggest meeting her at times when her children are not there. Or you can 
take your business elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Ron Riggio 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Question: I'm a part-time worker. How many hours must I be on the job before 
my boss is required to give me a break? For example, if I work a five-hour day, 
how many breaks am I entitled to? 
</P>
<P>
 -- D.B., Costa Mesa 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: If you are paid by the hour, rather than being on salary, you are 
entitled to one 10-minute break within a five-hour day. Under the federal Fair 
Labor Standards Act, an employer is not required to provide workers with rest 
periods such as coffee or snack breaks. However, the California Wage Orders 
require rest periods for hourly employees whose total daily work time is more 
than 3 1/2 hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Under state law, your boss must count such rest periods as working time and 
therefore pay you for them. But your employer can also require you to stay on 
company premises during your break because you are being compensated for the 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Elizabeth Winfree Lydon 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Question: I was recently promoted. One of the people now working for me makes 
more money than I do, since my employer didn't give me a big enough raise to 
compensate. How should I handle this? 
</P>
<P>
 -- J.B., Irvine 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: Congratulations on your promotion. Your situation is unfortunate but 
not uncommon, and there are several reasons why such apparent unfairness may 
exist. 
</P>
<P>
 One is pay compression. People who have been in an organization a long time 
typically have higher salaries than beginning employees. But to attract 
employees with particular skills, a company may have to pay new hires at a 
market rate close to, or above, that of its senior employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Another reason that a subordinate might earn more than his or her boss is the 
structure of the pay plan. If overlapping pay categories are used, the upper 
steps of one category (the subordinate's) may be higher than the lower steps of 
the next category (the manager's). Thus a new boss in the lower range of a 
higher category might receive less pay than a subordinate in the upper range of 
a lower category. Such a situation will be corrected as the manager moves up in 
the new pay grade. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, inequities may exist because no formal pay plan exists. If that is 
the case, your salary may be a direct result of your ability to bargain for 
higher wages. 
</P>
<P>
 What you should do about the problem depends on the cause of the pay 
disparity. In any case, you should first discuss the issue with your manager. 
He or she may have some discretion over pay and may be able to resolve your 
difficulty by raising your salary. If the problem is because of your company's 
pay structure, there may not be too much your manager can do. 
</P>
<P>
 If the problem is one of bargaining skills, you should prepare a persuasive 
argument about why you are worth more money. Sometimes getting a job offer from 
a competing firm can be a useful bargaining chip, but it can backfire if your 
manager tells you to go ahead and take the offer. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Tom Mayes 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Question: Everyone in our department knows that our supervisor, who is 
married, is having an affair with one of our co-workers, also married. The 
situation is awkward for the rest of us, and also the co-worker is treated with 
favoritism. How can we deal with this? 
</P>
<P>
 -- G.B., Anaheim 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: Do nothing. I understand that this is a very difficult situation. 
However, it extends beyond the boundaries of the workplace and into the private 
lives of your supervisor and co-worker -- and their spouses. Interfering or 
even just gossiping about the situation will probably do more harm than good. 
Try to ignore the bad situation, and focus instead on your own work goals. The 
situation may resolve itself. If it doesn't and you have difficulty working in 
such an environment, consider your alternatives.

MARKET BEAT / TOM PETRUNO: QUARTERLY STOCK MUTUAL FUND REVIEW; IF YOU THOUGHT 
LAST QUARTER WAS BAD, HANG ON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 For stock mutual fund investors, there were few places to hide in the first 
quarter. And there may be fewer in the second quarter, if Wall Street's bear 
nightmare comes true. 
</P>
<P>
 The average stock mutual fund lost 3.35% in the first quarter, the biggest 
quarterly decline since the 15.7% loss in the bear market of third-quarter 
1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Of 24 stock fund categories tracked by Lipper Analytical Services, only four 
showed gains for the quarter. The big winner: Japanese stock funds, up 17.3% on 
average. The big loser: Pacific region stock funds, which lost 11.5% on average 
as smaller Asian markets crumbled even as Japanese stocks surged. 
</P>
<P>
 For investors in most U.S. stock fund categories, the quarter's loss was 3% to 
5%. Coming after six straight quarterly gains, most fund shareholders probably 
wouldn't think much of this year's giveback. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem, of course, is that most of the funds' losses occurred in just one 
week -- last week. And with the stock market poised to plummet today after the 
latest dramatic surge in interest rates on Friday, what might ordinarily be a 
minor "correction" in stock fund prices now has the makings of something far 
worse. 
</P>
<P>
 So is this a good time to sell your funds -- or is it a better time to begin 
thinking about bargain-hunting? 
</P>
<P>
 The answer, of course, will be different for every investor. But as a general 
rule, getting a little more conservative in your portfolio probably is the 
smartest move, many experts say. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think everybody should be reducing their risk at this point," warns Charles 
LaLoggia, a bear who writes the Special Situation Report stock newsletter in 
Rochester, N.Y. At the very least, that means building a significant cash 
"safety" cushion to buffer against any broad stock decline. 
</P>
<P>
 This selloff could blow over, certainly. But the fact that this bull market 
has gone on longer than most -- 42 months -- means that a sharp decline is 
overdue. 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, rising interest rates mean that U.S. stocks (and foreign stocks) 
have competition they didn't have when rates were at 30-year lows in '93. That 
may force many stocks lower, temporarily, so their dividend yields are more 
competitive with bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 The great risk is that, just as last year's optimism boosted many stocks to 
wild heights, this year's pessimism could go too far on the downside. "Stocks 
go to undervalued from overvalued as sure as night follows day," LaLoggia says. 
</P>
<P>
 If this is indeed the start of a bear market, you could be looking at a 
painful decline in your stock fund's value, depending on the type of fund you 
own. Since 1978, Lipper Analytical has tracked six separate declines of 15% or 
more in the average growth stock fund. 
</P>
<P>
 If numbers like that scare you, and you feel an urge to take some profits out 
of your long-term stock funds, go ahead, experts say -- though not necessarily 
all at once today, in what may be a wild panic. Wait for the stock market to 
bounce in the near-term. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet many advisers suggest that long-term stock fund investors do nothing at 
all now, assuming they truly are long-term in outlook (i.e., they don't need 
their money for at least five years) and that they have a well-balanced 
portfolio with a hefty cash cushion. 
</P>
<P>
 Kurt Brouwer, whose San Francisco firm Brouwer & Janachowski manages $300 
million for individuals, has 65% of the typical client's assets in stock funds 
and 35% in short-term bond funds. 
</P>
<P>
 If he thought a bear market was brewing, Brouwer says, he would cut the 
stocks' weighting to 40%. But he doesn't see it. "Corporate earnings are coming 
in strong," Brouwer says, which suggests that the stock market -- or at least 
some stocks -- have life left in them. 
</P>
<P>
 And where should brave bargain-hunters troll? Michael Lipper of Lipper 
Analytical notes that real estate-related stock funds were up 0.81% in the 
first quarter, and could continue to surprise if a strong economy lifts real 
estate prices. He also suggests that the lack of enthusiasm for European stock 
funds (down 0.15% for the quarter) may be an invitation, if you expect Europe's 
economic recovery to arrive later this year. Stock Funds Give Some Back. . . 
</P>
<P>
 The average stock mutual fund dropped 3.4% in the first quarter, the first 
quarterly decline in seven quarters and the worst since the bear market slump 
of 15.7% in the third quarter of 1990. . . .as Investors Brace for the Worst 
</P>
<P>
 If you believe that a bear market is at hand, how much will the average stock 
fund drop? Here are the percentage losses in the last six major down cycles for 
the average growth stock fund. (Average growth fund decline/Market decline)

WELLS PLAYED A MAJOR ROLE IN DISNEY'S RECENT TURNAROUND; ENTERTAINMENT: 
EISNER'S RIGHT-HAND MAN HELPED BUILD COMPANY'S MARKET VALUE FROM $2 BILLION TO 
$22 BILLION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Frank G. Wells was something of a corporate character actor, playing a 
critical role in Hollywood's biggest turnaround but rarely getting the kind of 
star treatment accorded to Chairman Michael D. Eisner. 
</P>
<P>
 But the 62-year-old, unassuming Walt Disney Co. president and chief operating 
officer, who died in a helicopter crash on Sunday, was as much a part of 
Disney's comeback in the 1980s as any of the company's more recognized 
executives. Moreover, he was one of Hollywood's most popular figures, as 
evidenced by the reaction late Sunday to his death. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm in an incredible state of shock," said entertainment executive David 
Geffen, a close friend of Wells' for 25 years. "Not only was he a brilliant 
executive, he was an extremely honorable man. This is an incredible loss to the 
community." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Jeffrey Berg, chairman of the International Creative Management talent 
agency: "This is an incomprehensible loss. I know of no one who so relentlessly 
pursued life's callings and at the same time managed a brilliant career. 
Everyone will reflect upon his business success, when in fact his true devotion 
was to Luanne (his wife) and his kids." 
</P>
<P>
 This September will mark the 10th anniversary since Eisner and Wells were 
tapped to effectively save an American icon that was in danger of being 
dismantled by a host of corporate raiders who saw profit in breaking it up. 
Wells and Eisner were one of the few stable executive teams in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 Eisner and Wells had a rare working partnership, and industry executives say 
Wells will be difficult to replace. 
</P>
<P>
 "He behaved in the corporate world with an ethical standard unparalleled in my 
experience. I have lost a dear friend and my most treasured colleague," Eisner 
said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
 Wells was often overshadowed by the high-profile Eisner. The irony was that 
Eisner might not even have the job today had it not been for Wells. 
</P>
<P>
 The struggle for control of Disney in 1984 was engineered by investor Roy E. 
Disney, nephew of Walt Disney, who had become disenchanted with a company that 
he once said seemed to resembled a real estate company more than an 
entertainment giant. 
</P>
<P>
 According to John Taylor's 1987 "Storming the Magic Kingdom" book on Disney, 
Wells met with Roy Disney adviser Stanley Gold to discuss whether Wells would 
be interested in working for Disney. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to give you the best advice you've ever had on the subject. 
Whatever else you do, get Michael Eisner," Wells told Gold over lunch. 
</P>
<P>
 Eisner and Wells, along with such executives as Walt Disney Studios Chairman 
Jeffrey Katzenberg, turned the complacent company around, making the theme 
parks widely profitable, creating a major retailing business and rejuvenating 
the movie making division with hits such as "Beauty and the Beast," "Pretty 
Woman," "Sister Act" and "Aladdin." Disney also became the leader in selling 
home videos. 
</P>
<P>
 The value of the company in the stock market soared from about $2 billion when 
the two assumed their jobs to $22 billion by 1992. Wells and other Disney 
executives became the best-paid executives in the United States. In 1989, Wells 
earned more than $50 million. In late 1992, Wells reaped some $60 million by 
cashing in Disney options. 
</P>
<P>
 Until this past year, when the company was plagued by losses from its Euro 
Disney theme park, little had gone wrong under the Eisner-Wells regime. 
</P>
<P>
 Wells also was politically active, and was one of the key business executives 
who stepped forward to support President Clinton during the 1992 campaign when 
Clinton was looking for support from business leaders for his economic plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Wells worked as a lawyer for the entertainment firm Gang, Tyre & Brown, 
leaving to take a job as a senior executive at Warner Bros. He was working as a 
consultant to Warner Bros. when he was tapped as Disney's president and chief 
operating officer in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
 An avid environmentalist, Wells vowed to climb the tallest a mountain in every 
continent after leaving Warner Bros. in 1982. In a first-person story he wrote 
in 1991 for Forbes on mountain climbing, Wells joked about the possibility of 
his dying during one of his trips. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course I need a will. Not a will to succeed; a will to succeed me, should 
the worst happen. Here I am signing it on January 1, 1983," Wells wrote. 
</P>

 A Christian publishing company hopes there's more to know about Dave Thomas 
than his love for hamburgers and spicy chicken sandwiches. 
</P>
<P>
 The founder of Wendy's Old Fashioned Hamburgers has signed a contract with the 
Zondervan Corp. for a "personal success book, showing the average person how to 
improve his life by applying the same simple principles that turned Wendy's 
into a successful worldwide business," Zondervan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas will explain his philosophy of life and his Christian beliefs in the 
book. Scheduled for an August release, it is tentatively titled "Well Done."

FOOTNOTES / JAMES BATES: INVESTMENT ALCHEMY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 How good an investment did First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton make when she 
turned $1,000 into $99,000 over 10 months during the late 1970s largely by 
trading in cattle futures? 
</P>
<P>
 Consider the following comparisons: 
</P>
<P>
 In 10 months she made about three times what she would have made over 15 years 
had she invested the money in Fidelity Magellan, by far the best performing 
mutual fund in that period. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Lipper Analytical Services Inc., had Clinton invested the same 
$1,000 in the Magellan Fund on Dec. 31, 1978, it would only have been worth a 
mere $33,363.80 last Dec. 31. 
</P>
<P>
 Had she invested the $1,000 in the second-best performing fund, CGM Capital 
Development, she would have had $28,167 by the end of last year. 
</P>
<P>
 And the $1,000 invested in Aim Constellation, the third-best performer, would 
be worth only $18,574.50. Missed Scoring Opportunities 
</P>
<P>
 The playoff hopes of the Lakers, Kings, Clippers and Mighty Ducks are either 
fading fast or have vanished. So what does it mean to the bottom lines of the 
local sports teams? 
</P>
<P>
 Jerry Gorman, national director of Ernst & Young's sports practice and 
co-author of the new book "The Name of the Game: The Business of Sport," says 
making the playoffs can mean from $250,000 to $500,000 a game in revenue for a 
pro basketball team depending on the size of the team's market and arena. 
</P>
<P>
 For a hockey team, he says, each playoff game can mean from $300,000 to 
$600,000. 
</P>
<P>
 He says the amount is higher because there are more local television 
opportunities for hockey because basketball has its network television deal. 
</P>
<P>
 For the publicly traded Boston Celtics franchise, he adds, being shut out of 
the playoffs this year would mean about two cents a share per game for 
investors. The Write Trend 
</P>
<P>
 Ever on the cutting edge, some in Hollywood are now putting their x and y on 
the dotted line. 
</P>
<P>
 Art Guard International in Los Angeles is marketing to the rich and famous 
what it calls "The Worlds First DNA Gene Pen." According to promotional 
materials, "Your DNA Gene signature provides absolute and verifiable 
authenticity for any document." 
</P>
<P>
 The pen isn't cheap. Charles Butwell, the company's president, says it costs 
some $2,500 for the DNA work and about $50 a pen after that. 
</P>
<P>
 He says his clients include executives at such firms as Hanna-Barbera and 
Warner Bros., along with celebrities whose genetically accurate remain 
anonymous. Briefly. . .

 North Hollywood-based Masada Marketing is selling salts from the Dead Sea that 
people can put into their baths at home. . .One way to cut down: "The 
Entrepreneur Expo" in Long Beach next weekend will display among other things a 
vending machine that dispenses one cigarette at a time. . . Something to 
ponder: A working paper from the National Bureau of Economic Research is titled

FIRMS BANKING ON CHINA'S STATUS QUO; TRADE: THREATENED LOSS OF COUNTRY'S 
MOST-FAVORED NATION DESIGNATION COULD DRIVE UP COSTS OF U.S. BUSINESSES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON LEE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Robert Solomon, fresh from a trip to China, where he was checking on orders of 
Flintstone plush toys, has one word to describe the impact on his company if 
the United States yanks China's most-favored nation trade status: horrific.  
</P>
<P>
 About half of the stuffed animals and other toys sold by Solomon's Woodland 
Hills-based Dakin Inc. are manufactured in China. Overall, about 30% of the 
toys sold in the United States by various toy marketers, including several 
based in Southern California, are made in China. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Clinton Administration follows through on a threat not to renew China's 
trade status when it comes up for annual renewal in June -- a move that would 
boost tariffs on Chinese exports -- companies like Dakin would see a hefty 
boost in their costs. 
</P>
<P>
 "If MFN were revoked, I would not be out of business," said Solomon, Dakin's 
chairman. But he said he would have to pull out of China, where he contracts 
with a dozen factories that were built by Hong Kong investors, and shift 
production to other Asian countries such as Thailand, Indonesia or the 
Philippines. 
</P>
<P>
 "That would be chaotic, because we wouldn't be the only ones doing it," said 
Solomon, whose private company grossed about $75 million in sales last year. 
"There would be a mad dash out of China" by everyone in the toy industry 
looking for other low-cost manufacturing sites in Asia. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S.-China trade last year totaled $39 billion, with China buying $9 billion 
in U.S. products, mostly aircraft and telecommunications equipment, and the 
U.S. taking in almost $30 billion in Chinese exports, much of them toys, shoes 
and apparel. 
</P>
<P>
 In consideration of the impact on U.S. industry, U.S. officials have in recent 
days signaled a willingness to consider modifying its actions if China fails to 
make progress on human rights. For example, Assistant Secretary of State 
Winston Lord, said last week that trade benefits may be withdrawn only from 
China's state-owned enterprises. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the possibility of broad sanctions has provoked concern and anger among 
many U.S. manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a very, very strong personal opinion on it," began Steven Nichols, the 
soft-spoken chairman of K-Swiss Inc., a Chatsworth marketer of sneakers. "If 
you really want to attack communism, you do it with free enterprise, and that 
means free trade," Nichols said, his voice rising. "I don't want to defend 
China, but we're out of our mind not to do business with them every day." 
</P>
<P>
 K-Swiss gets about a million pairs of shoes, or about 15% of its annual total, 
at a 75,000-square-foot factory in the countryside along China's southeast 
coast. U.S. tariffs on those shoes average about 10%, but Nichols said they 
would jump to 20% or more if China loses most-favored nation status. 
</P>
<P>
 If that happens, "we could not operate there and send shoes to the U.S.," 
Nichols said. "It's difficult enough to compete with Reebok," he said, adding 
that giant U.S. shoe companies like Reebok and Nike have a greater share of 
their products made in China than K-Swiss, and are very likely to lead an 
exodus out of China if its status is not renewed. 
</P>
<P>
 K-Swiss, which does about $150 million in annual sales, also buys shoes in 
Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines. "There is more capacity there," 
Nichols said. "But if China closed down, they would know they could get a 
premium. . . . In the short term, there might be less shoes available and the 
price would go up" for retailers and consumers. 
</P>
<P>
 Like many other U.S. footwear companies, K-Swiss has relied more on China in 
recent years because of wage increases in countries such as South Korea. 
Besides lower wages, China's shoe factories, which are owned largely by 
Taiwanese businessmen, have a reputation for high productivity and quality, 
said Peter Mangione, president of the Footwear Distributors and Retailers of 
America, a trade group in Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
 One of Mangione's 70 members that is concerned is Cherokee Shoe of Thousand 
Oaks, which makes a third of its athletic and casual footwear in China. 
Cherokee Shoe, a unit of the Sunland-based apparel firm Cherokee Inc., does 
about $30 million in annual sales. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know what human rights has to do with controlling one's economy," 
said John Lovely, executive vice president of Cherokee Shoe, which has been 
been struggling enough with the recession. "We're assuming this is not going to 
happen," he said of China's loss of trade status. But if it does, he said, "it 
will be costly to us." 
</P>
<P>
 William Mow, founder and chairman of apparel firm Bugle Boy in Simi Valley, 
said he has not taken steps to prepare for China's loss of most-favored nation 
status. Mow considers it unlikely because of the importance of the rapidly 
growing Chinese market to the United States. "I hope we all come to our 
sanity," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, Mow relies on China for 22% of his company's production, which 
translates into 10 million shirts and pants made in China. Mow, whose family 
fled communist China when he was 13, contracts with factories in 26 Chinese 
cities, including Shanghai. Mow says he has to have production spread 
throughout China because there are U.S. quota limits for goods made in China, 
which in turn allocates that quota on a city-by-city basis. 
</P>
<P>
 If China loses its trade status, some of the duties will be 100%, Mow said. 
"We would definitely have to terminate our business there," said Mow, who owns 
90% of Bugle Boy, which last year had sales of about $440 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Mow says Bugle Boy produces clothes in a dozen other countries. But those 
countries also have U.S. quota limits, and some of them are running at 
capacity. "It would take us two years to allocate the Chinese production," he 
said.

 Former Reagan Aide Admits Addictions: Larry Kudlow, whose meteoric Wall Street 
career led to a post as adviser to President Ronald Reagan, now admits he's a 
recovering alcoholic and drug addict. The conservative economist says he's been 
sober for more than a year.Getting high helped him deal with work demands, he 
told the New York Times. "You think you're a superman, you think you can do 
anything," Kudlow said in a story published Sunday. Today, I see how tough it 
was." Kudlow, 46, was the strategist behind the tax-cut plan that helped propel 
Christie Whitman to an upset victory in the New Jersey governor's race last 
year. He advises other Republicans such as Jack Kemp and Rush Limbaugh. After 
Reagan was elected in 1980, Kudlow was named chief economist at the Office of 
Management and Budget under David Stockman. He was a leading proponent of 
"supply-side economics" -- tax cuts aimed at stimulating economic growth. He 
said he began drinking regularly in the late 1970s and then began using illegal 
drugs, which he wouldn't name. Fifteen months ago he took time off work from 
his Wall Street job to enter a drug rehabilitation program. He attends a 
program for recovering addicts as often as twice a day, and he fears a relapse.

 Asian stock markets were lower in afternoon trading today after an upbeat U.S. 
employment report released Friday rekindled concern that the Federal Reserve 
will raise short-term rates again to keep inflation in check. 
</P>
<P>
 Far East investors' reaction deepened worries that U.S. stocks will dive 
today. Most U.S. markets were closed on Good Friday, leaving domestic investors 
three days to contemplate their next moves. 
</P>
<P>
 In afternoon trading in Tokyo, the Nikkei stock index was off 269.46 points, 
or 1.4%, to 19,007.70. 
</P>
<P>
 In Bangkok, the SET stock index was down 33.26 points to 1,199.27 in midday 
trading, while Kuala Lumpur's composite index was off 15.70 points to 944.24. 
</P>
<P>
 Hong Kong, Sydney and several other Asian markets were closed for holidays. 
</P>
<P>
 There were other signs that U.S. stocks could plunge early today. In Tokyo 
trading at midday, futures contracts on the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index 
were down about 11 points from last Thursday's close, to 435.80. That 
represents a 2.5% drop in the S&P index, or about the same as a 90-point 
decline in the Dow Jones industrial average. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, individual investors in the United States appeared to be generally calm 
over the weekend. Major mutual fund companies, such as Fidelity Investments, 
said weekend calls to place Monday sell orders or to ask for advice weren't 
much above normal weekend levels. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. stock market had plunged last Monday through Wednesday, reacting to 
rising bond yields. Last Thursday, the stock market rallied a bit, raising 
hopes that bearish sentiment was ending. 
</P>
<P>
 Then came Friday's U.S. Labor Department report that the economy last month 
created 456,000 new jobs, the biggest gain in more than six years. 
</P>
<P>
 Some bond trading was conducted Friday even though stock markets were closed, 
and bond traders immediately registered their shock at the huge employment 
gain: The yield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond zoomed to its highest 
levels in 14 months, to 7.26% from 7.08% Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Unless market interest rates pull back sharply early today, before the U.S. 
stock market opens, most analysts believe stocks will plummet to reflect the 
bond market's selloff -- and the expectation that the Federal Reserve will 
quickly boost short-term interest rates again, in an attempt to moderate the 
economy's growth. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fed has raised short rates twice since Feb. 4, most recently to 3.5% from 
3.25% on March 22. 
</P>
<P>
 At midday today in Tokyo, the U.S. bond futures were trading at yield levels 
right around 7.26%. 
</P>
<P>
 Japanese bond yields rose at the start of Tokyo trading as traders reacted to 
the jump in U.S. yields Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Bond futures for June delivery, currently the active futures contract, were 
down 0.25 yen at 111.85 yen. The yield on the benchmark No. 157 10-year 
government bond was 3.925%, up 0.06 points. 
</P>
<P>
 "With U.S. yields at 7.26%, we can't say there won't be an effect on Japanese 
bonds," said Mikinao Matsushita, a fund manager at BOT Asset Management, a unit 
of the Bank of Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
 "The influence of the U.S. bond price fall, however, will be limited," 
Matsushita said. "Actions by the Bank of Japan and movements in the currency 
market could divert attention away from the U.S." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the dollar was a beneficiary of the surge in bond yields on Friday. 
After falling to as low as 102.13 yen last Thursday, the dollar was trading at 
104.10 yen in Tokyo early today. 
</P>
<P>
 As for Japanese stocks -- which had surged in the first quarter, even as most 
world markets fell -- "the immediate knee-jerk reaction is to hold off on all 
equity investment until the sky is clear on Wall Street," said Ravi Nandigum, a 
salesman at Baring Securities. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once the market starts stabilizing there, we will start to see money coming 
back to Japan but in the meantime, we'll see cautious trading."

 Year's First Bank Failure Reported: Mechanics National Bank of Paramount 
became the nation's first bank failure of 1994, the government said.The Office 
of the Comptroller of the Currency closed the bank, which had assets of about 
$165.8 million, because it was in an unsafe and unsound condition and had 
incurred losses that depleted its capital, said the OCC and the Federal Deposit 
Insurance Corp., which was named receiver on Friday. Losses totaled more than 
$21 million over two years, the government said. Home Bank of Signal Hill has 
assumed the insured deposits of the failed bank, the regulators said.

 Cuba, Russia Trading Sugar and Oil: An agreement for Cuba to sell Russia 1 
million tons of raw sugar in exchange for 2.5 million tons of oil this year is 
in the process of being implemented, an official Cuban newspaper reported. The 
weekly business newspaper Opciones quoted Cuban experts as saying the 
"ratification phase" of an agreement reached last December between the two 
countries had recently been concluded.The deal is crucial to Cuba, whose 
economy plunged into crisis after the collapse of the Soviet Union and the end 
of traditional trade and aid ties. Until the late 1980s, these ties included 
guaranteed markets for much of Cuba's cane sugar and about 13 millions tons of 
Soviet oil a year. Cuban officials have said they expect Cuba's 1993-94 sugar 
cane harvest, due to wind up in April or May, to be slightly better than last 
year's disastrously low 4.2 million tons.

 State's Exports Up Only 2% in 1993: State commerce officials said the slight 
increase was because of a huge decline in aircraft and aerospace products and a 
slump in European markets.The export of transportation equipment, which 
includes aircraft and aerospace items, fell 28.7%. If that is not included, 
state exports grew by 8.4%. Total worldwide exports of California goods were 
$70.3 billion. That total does not include legal and financial services, 
construction, movies, recordings, software and foreign tourism, which would 
increase the figure by $30 billion.

with the bank's 1991 closure. The court said it feared the executives would 
leave the country and adjourned the case until Saturday. The defendants face 
$10.3 billion in civil claims. Abu Dhabi authorities are holding the passports 
of the defendants, officials said. Ten have been held in the Abu Dhabi Police 
Club since the bank was shut down and another is free on bail. Two defendants, 
the bank's founder Agha Hassan Abedi and Ziauddin Akbar, are being tried in 
their absence.

 Motorola to Supply Equipment in Japan: Motorola of the United States will 
enter Japan's market of personal handy phones (PHPs), a new mobile phone 
technology with a large potential market, the Tokyo financial daily Nihon 
Keizai Shimbun reported. Motorola will supply terminals and other equipment to 
Japan's telecommunications giant, Nippon Telegraph & Telephone Corp., for use 
in its planned field tests to start this month, the paper said.Personal handy 
phones are a technology halfway between a cordless telephone and a cellular 
telephone, with more range than the former and less cost than the latter. While 
lighter and smaller than cellular phones, the primary downside of PHPs is that 
they cannot be used from a moving car or other vehicle. NEC Corp. and other 
Japanese telecommunications companies will also supply their products to NTT in 
the trial project.

 IBM to Introduce Low-Cost Mainframes: International Business Machines Corp. 
will launch the first of its low-cost, microprocessor-based mainframe computers 
Tuesday in an aggressive bid to restore falling revenues in its core business. 
Analysts said IBM will announce two machines with parallel processing 
architecture, one designed for transactions and another for large database 
queries.The computer giant will also add five new models to its current line of 
AS/9000 mainframes and make some aggressive moves in software pricing. 
Ironically, the rollout comes two days before the 30th anniversary of the IBM 
360 mainframe, the first system to computerize the Fortune 500 and turn the 
computer industry on its head. The 360 was the first important product in what 
would eventually become IBM's mainframe empire.

 Woolworth's Top Exec Steps Down: Woolworth Corp., which last week announced an 
internal probe into possible accounting irregularities, said its chairman and 
chief financial officer stepped down temporarily. Chairman William K. Lavin, 
who also relinquished the post of chief executive, was replaced on an interim 
basis in both positions by John W. Adams.Adams, a board member since 1981, 
heads the special committee charged with the accounting investigation and also 
chairs the New York retailer's audit committee. Woolworth, which is trying to 
recast itself as a specialty retailer by shedding its older, less profitable 
discount merchandise stores, didn't appoint a replacement for Chief Financial 
Officer Charles T. Young. Woolworth said the two executives stepped down 
"voluntarily" pending the outcome of the special committee's accounting probe.

CHINA STEPS UP ENFORCEMENT OF PIRACY LAWS; TRADE: JURIST TELLS U.S. THAT COURTS 
ARE SERIOUS ABOUT CLEANING UP PATENT AND TRADEMARK ABUSE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Stung by criticism that it permits thefts of intellectual property and other 
copyright infringement, the Chinese government has mounted a campaign to assure 
its foreign trading partners that it is serious about cleaning up abuses. 
</P>
<P>
 Patent and trademark laws are relatively new in China, but have been improving 
over time, Fei Zongyi, a justice of China's highest court, said in Los Angeles 
recently. "Compared to other countries, our legal system has developed very 
fast. We've demonstrated that China has made tremendous progress," said Fei, 
who was touring U.S. cities to explain his court's plans for legal enforcement 
to industry representatives concerned about the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview, the justice said he is now involved in drafting new contract, 
property, and arbitration laws. Such laws will help companies to enforce their 
contracts and seek remedies for violations, he said. Under the proposed laws, 
copyright violators could face criminal penalties for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
 In another measure designed to provide assurances that it is serious about 
eliminating violations, the government also said recently that it would sponsor 
seminars in China to inform business people and others about copyright laws now 
in effect. "Since last year, the emphasis is to let the public know the law, 
understand the law and follow the law," Fei said. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of continuing efforts to strengthen the law, the government last year 
extended copyright laws covering company products to trademarks owned by 
service industries. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, the government extended patent protection to chemical and 
pharmaceutical products and has extended the life of patents to 20 years, from 
12 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Although business executives who met with Fei said they were impressed by his 
willingness to come to the United States and explain Chinese policies, many 
said that China is still a long way from solving the problem of piracy. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's productive to have these meetings to let people know it's a serious 
problem, but you can't stop counterfeiting completely," said Howard C. Lincoln, 
chairman of Nintendo of America Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 Lincoln said Nintendo, the Redmond, Wash.-based subsidiary of the Japanese 
video game concern, lost more than $1 million last year because of piracy by 
state-owned or state-financed business in China, which distributed pirated 
Nintendo video games in China and around the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Nintendo isn't alone. Last year, U.S. businesses lost about $827 million 
because of piracy in China, according to the International Intellectual 
Property Alliance in Washington. Industries affected include computer software, 
music recordings, motion pictures and books. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem, industry officials said, lies in the enforcement of the laws. 
</P>
<P>
 "The penalty for piracy is rather insignificant. It's not a deterrent; there's 
practically no enforcement," said Jonas Rosenfield, president of the American 
Film Marketing Assn., a trade organization that represents about 110 
independent film companies worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
 The intellectual property alliance estimated that the motion picture industry 
lost about $50 million last year because of piracy in China. Many of the losses 
can be traced to a notorious factory in Shenzhen, an industrial Chinese city, 
which makes pirated laser discs with films from the United States, film 
industry officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the industry taking perhaps the biggest loss in China is computer 
software. Infringement cost the industry about about $322 million last year, 
according to the intellectual property alliance. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem, said Kenji Eigner, director of Asia Pacific sales at Rexon Inc., 
is that a pirate with one copy of software can duplicate as many as he wishes 
with no fear of retribution. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite success in computer hardware sales in China, Rexon, a Simi 
Valley-based manufacturer of personal computer accessories and software, said 
it has been reluctant to risk losses from piracy by introducing software in 
China. 
</P>
<P>
 Copyright protection is "the foundation for the entire software industry," 
said Brian McEachron, a senior corporate attorney for Microsoft Inc. who also 
met last week with Fei. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite Fei's assurance of legal enforcement, many U.S. representative said 
they are still skeptical about taking legal actions in Chinese courts. 
</P>
<P>
 Fei acknowledged that China does not have a discovery process to uncover 
records from parties in a lawsuit. While he maintained that the lack of 
discovery is a benefit toward quickly resolving disputes, American executives 
say that without discovery, it's often difficult to prove a claim. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the Americans say, Chinese enforcement is weak because of the 
often minimal compensation to victims. 
</P>
<P>
 When a Chinese company was caught illegally using the Walt Disney Co.'s Mickey 
Mouse trademark character, it was only fined $91. That figure would have been a 
hundred times more here, said Peter Nolan, Disney vice president and general 
counsel. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've tried through court actions, and the remedies we're getting from the 
judicial system (are) pitiful," he said.

 Foreign Investment in Airlines to Be Allowed: China will allow foreign 
airlines to invest in Chinese airlines this year, an official report said. "We 
will select at least one or two of our airlines for cooperation with foreigners 
this year," Wang Xuejiang, deputy director general of the Civil Aviation 
Administration of China's policy department, was quoted as saying.The report in 
the China Daily's Business Weekly said foreign airlines would be allowed to buy 
shares of domestic airlines, but did not give any other details. The move is 
motivated by the need for large amounts of capital to keep up with China's 
growing aviation demands, the report said. China expects 13% increases this 
year in passenger and freight traffic, to 38 billion passengers and 800,000 
tons of freight.

 Construction Payoffs Probe Winds Up: Japanese prosecutors indicted a former 
Cabinet minister on charges of taking bribes from a big construction firm, in 
effect wrapping up a yearlong probe into payoffs from the construction 
industry. Former Construction Minister Kishiro Nakamura is suspected of 
accepting a bribe of nearly $100,000 from Kajima Corp. in exchange for 
pressuring anti-monopoly officials not to pursue bid-rigging charges involving 
Kajima and others in public works contracts.Since last year, the investigation 
has resulted in a chain of arrests of nearly 30 senior construction executives 
and several top local officials. The probe stemmed from an earlier scandal 
involving the fallen kingmaker and vice president of the Liberal Democratic 
Party, Shin Kanemaru. He is currently on trial on charges of evading 1.04 
billion yen in taxes on hidden income from construction companies.

 Central Bank Governor Stepping Down: Malaysian central bank governor Jaffar 
Hussein will retire on May 1, according to Anwar Ibrahim, finance minister and 
deputy prime minister. The retirement, announced Friday, came one day after 
Hussein revealed that the bank lost $2.1 billion in foreign currency trades 
last year. Jaffar, 63, a former chairman and chief executive officer of Malayan 
Banking Bhd., took personal responsibility for the Bank Negara loss at an 
earlier news conference.

Q & A

By JAMES S. GRANELLI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 H. FRED MICKELSON 
</P>
<P>
 Chairman, Orange County Chamber of Commerce & Industry 
</P>
<P>
 As regional manager for Southern California Edison Co., H. Fred Mickelson is 
concerned about companies fleeing Orange County. If none replace those that 
leave, pressure builds to raise utility rates. As the chamber's chairman-elect 
last year, he formed the Consortium for Business Development to try to halt the 
flight. He also heads a state "red team" trying to keep Taco Bell Corp., which 
is weighing a possible move to Texas. Mickelson gave Times staff writer James 
S. Granelli an overview last week of county efforts to save jobs. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Question: How do you learn that companies are thinking of relocating? 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: What we've tried to get to is where companies that want to relocate 
call us first and give us a crack at solving their problems. The worst thing 
that can happen is that they're three-quarters of the way down the path and 
then, somehow, we find out about it. They've done all sorts of work, and yet it 
may be that we can solve the problems for them. Also, we don't want to get into 
an incentive bidding war. In California today, we won't win. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Why is that? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Because other states, to attract business -- because they have the space 
and the desire to build what California has become -- are willing to put in 
loss leaders to try to attract business there. So if you get into some sort of 
bidding war like that, you're only looking at a little piece of the equation. 
What I try to deal with immediately is: Why are you considering leaving? What 
problems do you face that I can help you solve? And then I try to bring to the 
table whatever and whomever is needed to make that happen. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How small a company will you go to? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Any size. At Edison, we're particularly proud of what we can do on the air 
quality and water quality areas. The reason is because medium and small 
companies, like a little furniture shop or a printer, do not have the staffs to 
be able to deal with regulations they may face. They're trying to keep their 
business going. They don't have time to go to somebody to try to deal with the 
issues. So we developed what we call CTAC, Customer Technology Application 
Center, in Irwindale. We have the ability to take a customer's product and find 
ways to do what they do -- but do it, for instance, with a satisfactory 
coating. Instead of using a solvent-based coating, use a water-based coating. 
Or instead of using regular inks, use ultraviolet inks. And so we have a number 
of cases where we were able to take the customer's product in there and, while 
the customer is still in business and worried about keeping going, we're 
working on his or her product and figuring out a different way to make it to 
comply with regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How many companies threatened to leave last year but decided to stay here 
after the consortium, the red team or the utility companies intervened? 
</P>
<P>
 A: We've had 19 saves where we were specifically responsible for keeping that 
customer. That equated to 4,126 jobs that were saved for the county. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What were the companies? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I have to pick and choose because companies are very concerned about 
confidentiality, even after they make the decision to stay. If there is a great 
to-do about "We may move, we may not move," then productivity goes down and 
people are concerned. Many companies just don't want any discussion during the 
negotiations. But the ones that are no longer confidential are Pilkington 
Aerospace in Garden Grove, with 470 employees; Loral Aeronutronic, now in 
Rancho Santa Margarita, which saved 1,400 jobs; All Metals Processing in 
Stanton, with 110 employees; Crispy Snacks in Huntington Beach, with 150 
employees; and Martin Molded Rubber in La Habra, with 60 employees. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Q: Chambers of commerce in the West have been criticized for failing to have 
any idea about economic development and for allowing California to be robbed, 
in essence, by states where chambers are more focused on economic development. 
</P>
<P>
 A: I agree almost categorically with that statement. I'll speak to Orange 
County. Orange County, up to about a year and a half ago, didn't have a clue. 
Times had been good for decades. Whenever someone left, there were two waiting 
to come in. So the chamber was not active in economic development. When we 
replaced the chamber's president, we looked for a person who had economic 
development expertise. We found him in Oklahoma. It turned out he knew more 
about Orange County than we did because he had been here stealing our customers 
for Norman, Okla. He could name a handful from Orange County alone, and most of 
them we didn't even know about. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Companies like Loral, which was facing an exorbitant rent hike, had to 
move. But Taco Bell and others don't have that kind of pressure on them. Is it 
more difficult in those situations to get companies to stay? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Companies that simply hear the siren songs from other areas typically are 
not rapid decision makers, nor do they really know why they want to move. It 
often takes a substantially longer period of time to negotiate with them 
because they're not driven by some need like Loral's to leave. So quite 
truthfully, it's much easier to deal with someone who's either run out of space 
and has to do something to grow or has a defined reason they must go. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Are Orange County and Southern California in general better equipped to 
keep and attract small- and medium-size businesses than big corporations? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Anywhere you have a plethora of medium and small companies as we have in 
Orange County -- 90% of the businesses in Orange County are medium to small -- 
it is easier to isolate the issues and the problems and to solve them. We don't 
have a number of (large) corporate headquarters in Orange County. It's 
wonderful as companies develop and become huge and international, but the 
backbone of business remains small and medium-size companies wherever you go, 
and that includes Orange County.

 "Our efforts right now are not only in retention but in growth of existing 
businesses. When a firm decides to add people, we want them to add that 
operation here rather than elsewhere."

<P>
 On the chamber's future role in developing the county's economy. . . 
</P>
<P>
 "There will come a day, perhaps even this year, when we will have a full-time 
economic development director and staff to find firms that we can bring here."

</P>
<P>
 On the fight to keep national companies here. . . 
</P>
<P>
 "Southern California and Orange County are higher-priced to do business. So 
there has to be compelling reasons why you choose to stay here."

 OCCUPATION: BREAD BAKER 
</P>
<P>
 Name: William Orquiz 
</P>
<P>
 Restaurant: Gustaf Anders 
</P>
<P>
 Thumbs up: "I always try to do my best in my job. I concentrate and focus on 
making the breads the very best. It is creative and fulfilling." 
</P>
<P>
 Thumbs down: "There isn't anything to dislike about my job. That is probably 
because everyone here is a professional and does the job well. We all work 
together." 
</P>
<P>
 Next step: "I would like to try all the various kinds of cooking done in the 
restaurant. I like all the different foods and am always very hungry to learn." 
</P>
<P>
 Advice: "Baking bread is a very delicate process. If you get one step out of 
order, it could ruin the dough. Get the right recipes, and don't change them 
for any reason. The doughs must be worked very clean and exact. It takes 
concentration and efficient work to be able to bake so many different kinds of 
bread every day. Each has different requirements." 
</P>

workday is usually over by 2:30 or 3 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Educational and training requirements: Many apprentice bread bakers train on 
the job in restaurants or bakeries. Others attend culinary school. 
</P>
<P>
 Job description: "Since I am the first to arrive in the morning, I walk 
through the restaurant and make sure everything is OK. Then I prepare my doughs 
and set them to rise. I am usually ready to bake by 7 a.m., and the breads are 
finished by 11 a.m. Then I start on preparations for the next day. We serve 
onion rolls, focaccia, pumpernickel, walnut bread, Swedish country, caraway and 
fennel rolls. It is methodical work, but very creative."

QUARTERLY STOCK MUTUAL FUND REVIEW; STOCK FUNDS' CASH ASSETS BEAR SCRUTINY IN A 
DOWN MARKET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM PETRUNO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Before you sell your stock fund in fear of a bear market, find out if the 
manager has already done some selling for you. 
</P>
<P>
 Fund managers have varying degrees of flexibility with their portfolios. Some 
always stay fully invested in stocks, which means they get a big lift in bull 
markets. But a fully invested fund also is likely to plummet sharply in a bear 
market. By contrast, a fund manager who can shift a large part of the portfolio 
to "cash" in a dicey market may be able to insulate his shareholders from huge 
declines. 
</P>
<P>
 Some mutual fund companies stay fully invested by charter. The La Jolla-based 
Pacific Horizon Aggressive Growth fund, for example, rarely has more than 5% of 
its assets in cash. As money comes in, it's put to work in stocks. Likewise, 
the Twentieth Century funds in Kansas City also tend to stay fully invested, no 
matter what the market outlook. 
</P>
<P>
 Most stock funds allow their managers more leeway. Some can hold as much as 
50% of their assets in cash if they believe the market is headed for a fall, or 
if they simply can't find enough attractive stocks to own. The average stock 
fund had 8.9% of assets in cash at the end of February, the most recent figure 
available, according to the fund industry's chief trade group. 
</P>
<P>
 The Denver-based Janus Fund, one of the top-performing growth stock funds of 
the last 15 years, now has 29% of its assets in cash. Manager Jim Craig has 
been wary of the stock market's relatively high prices for some time, and has 
preferred to wait for better opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first quarter, Janus Fund dropped 2.6%, while the Pacific Horizon 
Aggressive Growth fund tumbled 8.6%. 
</P>
<P>
 If you don't know your fund's cash position, call and ask. Though large cash 
holdings may give many fund owners comfort, remember: A manager who lurches 
between heavy cash and low cash is a market timer. If done well, market-timing 
can enhance shareholders' returns. 
</P>
<P>
 But timing is a tough game, and the risk is that an underinvested fund will 
miss out on big gains if the market skyrockets before the fund manager can pump 
his cash hoard back into stocks. TOM PETRUNO

QUARTERLY STOCK MUTUAL FUND REVIEW; WALL STREET SLUMP DOESN'T SCARE OFF THESE 
GROWTH-STOCK FUNDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM PETRUNO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Friday's report that job creation in March was the highest in six years 
terrified the bond market, and may do the same to the stock market when it 
opens today.  
</P>
<P>
 But for investors in growth-stock mutual funds, the ruckus may seem a bit 
absurd: If you're investing for growth, isn't a strong economy exactly what 
you've been hoping for? Here's a look at how two growth-stock funds expect to 
gain from the economy's long-awaited pickup. * 
</P>
<P>
 Clarke Adams, co-manager of the Greenville, Del.-based Brandywine Fund, 
figures that stock investors shouldn't pay much attention to the bond market's 
current upheaval. 
</P>
<P>
 Bonds are "trying to paint a picture that good news is bad. But good news is 
good " for growth-stock investors, Adams argues. 
</P>
<P>
 Early last Thursday, as the stock market continued its weeklong plunge, 
Brandywine stepped up and bought. Until then, the fund had about 20% of its $2 
billion in assets in cash. "We deployed about half of that cash on Thursday," 
Adams said. 
</P>
<P>
 The fund's concept is straightforward: Find companies with "new products or 
new services that can gain market share at the expense of competitors," Adams 
says. If a company's earnings surge, its stock price will inevitably follow, he 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 Brandywine's record has been stellar: It rang up a 183% return for 
shareholders between 1988 and 1993. Last year the fund was up 22.6%. In the 
first quarter, it slipped 0.1%, versus a 3.45% drop for the average growth 
fund. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite talk of a bear market, Adams doesn't see it -- not with the economy 
rising. So he used last week's market selloff to grab stocks of firms that he 
believes are best positioned for faster earnings growth in a healthy economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the stocks on Brandywine's buy list last week were hospital giant 
Columbia/HCA Healthcare and computer networker Cisco Systems. 
</P>
<P>
 Technology remains a major sector bet by Brandywine, making up about 30% of 
the fund. Besides Cisco, the fund owns such classic tech growth names as Lotus 
Development and Newbridge Networks. 
</P>
<P>
 Adams' search for fast growth also has led him to invest in Chrysler, GM and 
Ford. Despite the stocks' recent slumps, "We think it's pretty early" in the 
auto sales cycle, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Likewise, Brandywine owns such economy-sensitive issues as machinery giant 
Caterpillar and National Gypsum, a maker of wallboard that has boomed with the 
rebound in housing. 
</P>
<P>
 What about the argument that higher interest rates automatically reduce the 
"fair" prices for stocks, including growth issues? Shouldn't that mean lower 
growth-stock prices even if earnings soar? 
</P>
<P>
 If growth stocks were selling for absurdly high prices that might be true, 
Adams allows. But he says the average price-to-earnings ratio (P-E) of 
Brandywine's stocks is 17, based on 1994 estimated earnings. Yet the average 
earnings growth rate of his stocks is about 50%, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 The upshot: Growth is cheap, Adams contends. "We think the growth sector is 
selling at one of the lowest P-Es relative to earnings growth in the last 30 
years." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Warren Isabelle steered the Boston-based Pioneer Capital Growth fund to a 4.5% 
first-quarter gain, despite Wall Street's slump. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, he concedes that he probably won't escape if stocks continue to dive in 
the short run. Rather than time the market, he stays fully invested, which 
means he's potentially very vulnerable in a bear cycle. 
</P>
<P>
 But he's hoping that his shareholders have the willpower to stick with him 
through any short-term selloff. That's because Isabelle owns a host of small, 
little-known manufacturing companies that he believes have enormous potential 
as the economy shows its muscle. 
</P>
<P>
 "These (companies) are going to start showing earnings momentum that nobody 
can believe," Isabelle gushes. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Brandywine's Adams, Isabelle's approach to investing is "bottoms up," 
meaning company by company. But Isabelle deals in smaller, more thinly traded 
stocks that are likely to have little or no following on Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will look in odd places for value," Isabelle says. "I look for companies 
that I would go out and buy myself." 
</P>
<P>
 His portfolio now includes such obscure names as BEI Holdings, a real estate 
consulting firm that specializes in distressed properties; Avondale Industries, 
a Louisiana shipbuilder, and Park-Ohio Industries, a mini-conglomerate in 
consumer and industrial products. 
</P>
<P>
 Isabelle is most excited about his manufacturing names, including Furon Co., a 
Laguna Niguel-based producer of all sorts of plastic parts for industry. While 
shares of auto makers and other major industrial names have already surged, 
Isabelle sees smaller supplier companies like Furon as a back-door way to play 
the cyclical game. 
</P>
<P>
 Furon's stock is at $16.50 now on Nasdaq, and barely responded to the 
company's recent strong quarterly earnings report, Isabelle says. He believes 
the company is capable of earning as much as $2 a share (annually) at its peak, 
giving the stock a relatively low price-to-earnings multiple of eight based on 
that estimate. 
</P>
<P>
 Pioneer Capital Growth, only four years old, rose 37% in 1991, 29% in 1992 and 
17% last year. Yet Isabelle says his $255-million portfolio should still have 
the wind at its back, if he's right on the companies' earnings potential. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of the stocks I own haven't done anything in three years," he says, 
waiting on a healthier economy.

QUARTERLY STOCK MUTUAL FUND REVIEW; Q & A; RED HOT MUTUALS: A PRIMER ON FUND 
INVESTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHY M. KRISTOF, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After languishing for two years after the 1987 stock market crash, mutual 
funds became one of the hottest success stories of the 1990s, as investors 
started pouring money into the funds as never before. 
</P>
<P>
 Investors now have $2.14 trillion in mutual funds, up from $1.9 trillion at 
year-end 1993. And despite recent market volatility, mutual funds -- which 
specialize in everything from fixed-rate investments to highly volatile 
international stocks -- are expected to remain popular. 
</P>
<P>
 But for many investors, mutual funds are still a mystery. What are they and 
what do they do? Here's a look. 
</P>
<P>
 Question: What is a mutual fund? 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: A mutual fund is a company that pools the funds of many people and 
invests the money following stated guidelines. Each investor owns a piece of 
the investment pool that corresponds to the amount of money he or she invested. 
For instance, if you invested $1,000 in a fund that has total assets of 
$100,000, you would have a 1% stake in the fund. If the fund's value rose to 
$120,000, your 1% stake would be worth $1,200. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Where can I buy a mutual fund? 
</P>
<P>
 A: You can buy mutual funds from brokers, banks or financial planners or 
directly from the funds. You may also be investing in mutual funds through a 
401(k) plan at work. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Does it matter where I buy fund shares? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Somewhat. When you buy shares from brokers, financial planners and banks 
you will generally pay a "load." A load is a sales charge, usually between 3% 
and 8.5% of the amount you invested. If you buy shares from a mutual fund 
company directly, you generally don't have to pay a load. In other words, if 
you buy an 8% load fund from a broker, only $920 of your $1,000 investment goes 
to work for you. When you buy a no-load fund, the entire $1,000 is invested. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: If I buy a load fund from a banker, do I get the protection of federal 
deposit insurance? 
</P>
<P>
 A: No. Mutual funds are not federally insured, no matter where you buy them. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Then why would anyone pay a load?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Advice. When you buy through a broker, banker or financial planner you 
should expect to get sage advice about dividing up your assets among different 
types of investments and advice about which funds are best for you. If you 
don't need the advice, however, there's no reason to choose a load fund. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: So if they are not federally insured, how safe are mutual funds? 
</P>
<P>
 A: The overall risk depends on what the fund buys. A fund that buys government 
bonds is essentially as safe as government bonds. A fund that buys stocks of 
major companies is, on average, safer than one that buys stock of small 
companies. But to shelter the funds from outright fraud, unparalleled federal 
structural safeguards have been built into the industry. Extensive, regular 
reports are required. And most importantly, the invested funds are held 
separately from the mutual fund company. The "custodian" is usually an 
independent bank. If the mutual fund company is in trouble, it cannot just help 
itself to the customer's money. Although plenty of funds are not invested 
wisely, the risk of theft or abuse is very small. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Is the load the only cost of investing in a mutual fund? 
</P>
<P>
 A: No. You also pay annual management fees, which usually amount to about 1% 
of your investment each year. And some fund companies charge an annual 
marketing fee called a 12(b)1 fee, as well. A mutual fund discloses these fees 
in a prospectus -- legal documents that spell out the risks and rewards of that 
particular fund -- that is usually given to investors before they invest. These 
fees are used to calculate a fund's "expense ratio." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Should you always look for the lowest-cost funds? The ones with the lowest 
expense ratios, for instance? 
</P>
<P>
 A: No. Expense ratios are important because the expenses reduce your overall 
return. However, the main thing is what you're getting for your money. If the 
fund with higher expenses consistently returns more than the lower-cost fund, 
it's worth the cost. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, say you were trying to choose between the Berger One Hundred 
fund and the Vanguard/Morgan Growth fund. Vanguard charges just a .49% annual 
management fee. The Berger fund charges a lofty 1.63%. But the Berger fund 
returned 21.2% in 1993 versus the Vanguard fund's 7.32% return, according to 
the Investor's Guide to Low-Cost Mutual Funds. Chances are, those who invested 
in the Berger fund last year didn't get too uptight about the fee. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Q: My employer gives us a choice of funds in our 401(k) retirement plan but 
won't give us financial advice. Why not? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Because making suggestions would expose the employer to liability if you 
made the wrong choices and were left with insufficient savings for retirement. 
However, some employers are trying to educate their workers about the risks and 
rewards of their various choices through clearly written employee newsletters 
and magazines. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Why are stock funds so often suggested over bond or money market funds? 
Aren't they more risky? 
</P>
<P>
 A: They are more risky. However, if history is a guide, they also perform 
better over long periods. And for someone who has a long time before they'll 
need their money, that extra return can be pivotal. 
</P>
<P>
 Can you rely on this to happen in future? Many financial advisers would argue 
that anything so serious as to prevent companies listed in the stock markets 
from increasing in value -- an end to innovation, environmental disaster, 
political rejection of the free market system or world nuclear war -- could 
equally damage bond and money market funds. 
</P>
<P>
 The key point to remember is that stocks offer protection against inflation in 
the long run, while fixed-rate investments do not. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Given the recent market drop, should I be revamping my asset mix -- pulling 
money out of stocks and bonds and putting it into cash, for instance? 
</P>
<P>
 A: If your asset allocation strategy is fairly up-to-date -- in other words, 
in the past year, you've reviewed your goals and put specific amounts into 
stocks, bonds, cash and other investments to suit your goals -- you shouldn't 
let this slide bother you. 
</P>
<P>
 However, if it's been a while since you've looked at your investment plan or 
if you've never really considered the best way to break up your assets, this 
would be a good time to think about your goals and review your investments. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: I was thinking about investing in equity mutual funds, but last week's drop 
in the stock market is giving me pause. Would it still make sense? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Yes, although you might want to get in more slowly than normal, using a 
popular program called "dollar-cost-averaging." Dollar-cost-averaging simply 
means that you invest the same amount regularly. When the stock market is high, 
your investment gets you relatively fewer shares. When it's low, it buys more. 
When the market direction looks uncertain, this is a particularly attractive 
way to go because, over time, dollar-cost-averaging tends to even out the 
effect of market swings on your portfolio. 
</P>
<P>
 Mutual funds make using this strategy exceptionally simple by allowing you to 
set up automatic investment plans, where the fund company automatically and 
regularly withdraws even small amounts from your checking account.

QUARTERLY STOCK MUTUAL FUND REVIEW; ERODING SHARE PRICES SET BOND INVESTORS 
AQUIVER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM PETRUNO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The mutual fund industry's greatest concern right now isn't whether some small 
percentage of stock fund investors will decide to cash out. 
</P>
<P>
 The bigger worry is how millions of conservative investors in bond funds will 
react to the news that they're losing money, as surging market interest rates 
devalue older bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 Bond funds "are where the real crisis is," says Eric Kobren, head of the 
Mutual Fund Investors Assn., a fund newsletter publisher based in Wellesley 
Hills, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first quarter, the average stock fund fell 3.35%, the largest quarterly 
loss since the third quarter of 1990. But in theory, anyway, most stock 
investors understand that they're taking a risk of loss in the market. 
</P>
<P>
 The same may not be true for bond fund investors. Many of them bought into 
high-yielding bond funds in recent years simply as substitutes for low-yielding 
bank certificates of deposit. 
</P>
<P>
 Substitution was fine as long as market interest rates were falling, which 
they did from 1990 through most of last year. Bond fund investors earned their 
high yields, and their principal (the money originally invested) also increased 
because older, higher-yielding bonds appreciated in value. 
</P>
<P>
 But now market interest rates are rising rapidly, as the economy expands and 
investors fear higher inflation. The result is that bond mutual fund share 
prices are sliding, eroding investors' principal -- and their willingness to 
stick with the funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Lipper of fund-tracker Lipper Analytical Services in New York says 
preliminary figures show that the average bond fund had a "negative total 
return" of 2.53% in the first quarter. That means that despite the interest 
earned on its bonds during the quarter, the average fund's share price fell 
enough to effectively wipe out the interest earnings, and then some. 
</P>
<P>
 The damage was much worse for some types of funds, as the accompanying chart 
shows. The Dreyfus General Municipal bond fund was off 6.2% for the quarter; 
the Vanguard Long-Term Treasury fund dove 5.6%. Many bond funds are showing 
their largest losses in seven years. 
</P>
<P>
 Naturally, funds that own bonds maturing farthest in the future have been 
slammed hardest, because longer-term fixed-rate bonds depreciate most rapidly 
when market rates begin to rise. That makes sense, if you think about it: The 
longer a bond's term, the greater investors' fear of being stuck with its fixed 
yield while higher-yielding opportunities become available in the interim. 
</P>
<P>
 So potential buyers are dropping the prices they're willing to pay for bonds, 
depreciating the market across the board. 
</P>
<P>
 Should most bond investors care if their underlying principal is eroding? If 
they're investing solely for current income, they may not. They're still 
getting paid their interest -- anywhere from 4% to 8% annualized, depending on 
the type of fund -- even if it's being used to buy more shares (i.e., it's 
being "reinvested"). 
</P>
<P>
 Also, if the bond market is overreacting to the economy's strength, market 
interest rates could soon begin to fall back, which means bond fund share 
prices would appreciate again, though not necessarily back to their peak levels 
of 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Lipper believes that conservative, risk-adverse older individuals who are 
solely invested in long-term bond funds ought to instead build a "laddered" 
portfolio: Sell one-half to three-quarters of your long-term fund, even if it 
means taking a loss, and reinvest half the proceeds in a short-term bond and 
half in an intermediate-term fund. 
</P>
<P>
 Though short-term interest rates have been rising with long rates, 
shorter-term bonds don't depreciate anywhere near as fast as long-term bonds in 
this kind of environment. You'll earn a lower yield on shorter-term bonds, but 
your principal will be more stable. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, Vanguard Group's long-term municipal bond fund has suffered a 
loss (negative total return) of 6% this year. But the firm's short-term muni 
fund is down just 0.1%. The long-term muni fund currently yields 5.5%, while 
the short-term muni fund yields 3.2%. By blending a portfolio of short-, 
intermediate- and long-term bond funds you can earn a mid-range yield while 
protecting against deep principal losses. 
</P>
<P>
 Some experts, however, believe that truly conservative investors who can't 
stand to lose any principal ought to just admit they were wrong to buy a bond 
fund, sell it, and go back to a bank CD. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you really don't belong in it, get out," Kobren advises. The mental agony 
such bond owners now face is "just not worth it," he says.

performance on Thursday. Trouble in Bond Land

MUTUAL FUNDS / RUSS WILES: QUARTERLY STOCK MUTUAL FUND REVIEW; WHILE OTHER 
ASIAN MARKETS FALTER, JAPANESE STOCKS HAVE A NEW SURGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUSS WILES, RUSS WILES, a financial writer for the Arizona Republic, 
specializes in mutual funds. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Aircraft carriers and supertankers can't turn on a dime, but stock markets 
can, judging from the way Asia-oriented mutual funds have been behaving lately. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Asian stock markets outside of Japan were riding a crest of 
popularity. Prices doubled in Hong Kong, the Philippines, Malaysia and 
Indonesia, and nearly did so in Thailand, Taiwan and Singapore. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, those markets are sprouting leaks, having been swamped by a tidal wave of 
bad news from the United States and China. Stocks in Hong Kong, Thailand and 
Malaysia have lost roughly a quarter of their value since the year began. 
</P>
<P>
 Adding to the irony is that Japanese stocks, which got left at the dock in 
last year's fourth quarter, have mostly been steaming ahead this year. Though 
they have faltered the past two weeks, pure-Japan stock mutual funds still rose 
17.3%, on average, in the first quarter -- the best performance of any fund 
category, according to Lipper Analytical Services. 
</P>
<P>
 Japan's stock market was one of the few beacons during a dismal first quarter 
around the globe. 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, Pacific region stock funds, some of which have Japanese holdings 
but many of which are geared to smaller Asian markets, tumbled 11.5% for the 
quarter, on average. 
</P>
<P>
 In part, these turnabouts can be explained by a dose of sanity returning to 
world financial circles. No investments can keep doubling in price, so stocks 
in Hong Kong and the other Southeast Asian markets were due for a period of 
digestion, if not indigestion. 
</P>
<P>
 And stocks previously may have dropped too severely in Japan, notwithstanding 
that country's uncommonly weak economy and tumultuous politics. The 
top-performing Japanese stock fund in the first quarter, the DFA Japan 
Small-Company fund, was up 28.44%, making it the biggest winner among all stock 
funds. 
</P>
<P>
 But that fund had been the worst stock fund of the fourth quarter, when it 
fell 23.93%. 
</P>
<P>
 And over the past four years, of course, Japanese stocks have been in a deep 
bear market, and they remain off 50% from their 1989 peaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, "what you have is a country with low interest rates in deep recession, 
with a government that's using strong fiscal policy to move the economy up," 
says Walter Frank, chief investment officer for Donoghue's Moneyletter 
newsletter in Ashland, Mass. "That's the recipe for a rising economy and stock 
market." 
</P>
<P>
 It also helps that the yen has been rising against the dollar, boosting the 
value of Japanese stocks from the standpoint of American investors. 
</P>
<P>
 Between a tax cut and government spending on infrastructure, the Japanese 
government's stimulus package is worth an impressive $135 billion, says William 
Wendler, vice president of Rowe Price-Fleming International, which manages the 
international funds of Baltimore-based T. Rowe Price Associates. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Wendler sees the Japanese market's two-year outlook as promising, his 
firm isn't convinced that Japan has emerged from its recession just yet. 
</P>
<P>
 The T. Rowe Price International Stock Fund has just a 22% stake in Japan, even 
though Japanese shares account for 44% of the total value of all non-U.S. 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
 One dilemma facing investors is whether Japanese stocks, which had risen to 
excessive levels in the late 1980s, remain overpriced even today. The market's 
price-to-earnings ratio stands around 80, roughly where it peaked in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 "The key difference is that the world economy was facing a recession back 
then, while it's looking at a recovery today," says Wendler. 
</P>
<P>
 Other valuation measures, such as dividend yields and the price-book ratio, 
show the Japanese market to be more reasonably priced, analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
 At any rate, Frank believes Japan is too important to ignore and recommends 
that growth-oriented Americans allocate 10% to 15% of their stock holdings to 
the market, including what they might already have in Japan through broadly 
diversified international funds. 
</P>
<P>
 The problems facing investors in Hong Kong and other Southeast Asian markets 
are quite different from those for Japan. These smaller economies have been 
expanding rapidly in recent years, buoyed by increased trade with China and the 
West. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the danger that Washington may revoke China's preferential trading status 
within the next two months has spooked the Hong Kong market in particular. 
</P>
<P>
 Such a move would curtail trade and lop 2% from Hong Kong's economic output, 
estimates Chen Zhao, managing editor of the China Analyst, a newsletter from 
the Montreal-based Bank Credit Analyst Research Group. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, rising American interest rates are being felt in Hong Kong, because the 
currency of the British colony is linked to the U.S. dollar. A third concern 
for investors is the poor health of Deng Xiaoping, China's market-reform 
leader. 
</P>
<P>
 "If all three of these dangers happen at once, the Hong Kong market will go 
down the tubes" despite already steep losses, says Zhao, who calls the next 
three months critical. 
</P>
<P>
 Otherwise, Southeast Asia's investment potential remains sound, he says. 
Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand, among other Pacific economies, are expected 
to grow at much faster rates than mature Western economies over the next 
decade. 
</P>
<P>
 So, for investors owning shares in Pacific region stock funds -- or wanting to 
buy -- the key is to view these volatile markets solely as long-term plays. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't do any good to chase after last quarter's top performers" while 
bailing out of the worst funds, warns Neil Burns, a broker and certified 
financial planner at LPL Financial Services in Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
 He recommends that growth-oriented investors maintain up to 12% of their 
portfolios in emerging-markets funds, of which Southeast Asian stocks are a 
core. 
</P>
<P>
 Wendler, too, is clearly optimistic about the future of the Pacific region. 
</P>
<P>
 "Near term, the markets will be choppy, but long term this is still our 
favorite part of the world," he says. Asian Connections 
</P>
<P>
 If you already own a broadly diversified international or global mutual fund, 
chances are you have some exposure to Japan and the other Pacific Region 
markets such as Hong Kong, Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand. 
</P>
<P>

ANN CONWAY: O.C. FRIENDS BID EU ADIEU AS SHE TAKES DIPLOMATIC POST 
</P>

<P>
 It has been 25 years since March Fong Eu smashed a commode on the Capitol 
steps and launched the political career that led to her 18-year stint as 
California secretary of state. 
</P>
<P>
 Remind her today of that Sacramento protest against pay toilets and she has a 
good laugh, then gets serious about opportunity for women: "The sky's the 
limit. If women keep trying, their dreams come true. First, they must get a 
good education, some experience. After that, they should go for it." 
</P>
<P>
 On the eve of her swearing-in last week as ambassador to Micronesia, Eu and 
her husband, Henry Eu -- son of one of the wealthiest families in the Far East, 
according to reports -- joined local Asian leaders for a farewell party in the 
Costa Mesa banking offices of Topaz Tran. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a farewell party for her in Los Angeles, but I wanted to have one 
here so my friends could meet her," said Tran, who has been Eu's friend for 15 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 Of her ambassadorship, Eu said: "I never dreamed it would happen, but it has 
been a secret wish for many years. While I'm there I'll be concentrating on 
what the President and State Department have asked me to do -- help the people 
become more economically sufficient. 
</P>
<P>
 "Micronesia was a Trust Territory of the United States for more than 40 years, 
then became independent eight years ago. They are in the process of 
nation-building, trying to be self-sufficient. It's the responsibility of the 
United States to help them achieve those goals." 
</P>
<P>
 Eu will leave her palatial digs in Hancock Park to live in the Western 
Pacific. "It's going to be very different living on an island -- I don't quite 
know how to prepare for it," she said. "I've told (the U.S. government) that 
I'd like to go, take a look, then come back and get what I need." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Tran, director of the United American Bank in Little Saigon, will accompany Eu 
on her maiden visit to Micronesia this month. "I'm just going along as her 
friend -- to help her feel comfortable," she said. "I'm a Republican, but she 
is my good friend, so I try to help." 
</P>
<P>
 While guests waited for Eu to arrive, they sipped wine and sampled Asian 
specialties -- homemade spring rolls, fried rice and chicken noodles -- and 
talked of their special projects. 
</P>
<P>
 Tran -- who was dressed in a champagne silk suit by Chinese designer Joyce Kay 
(a favorite designer of Eu's) -- plans to open an orphanage in Vietnam. "My 
good friend Chuong Bui, who ran an orphanage in Vietnam, was captured and 
imprisoned after the communists came in 1974," Tran said. "Now I want to build 
a new orphanage. I am hoping that some of the 70 children who had to flee will 
come back to volunteer there." 
</P>
<P>
 Bui, who attended the party with his wife, Cam Ha, recalled when he broke out 
of prison: "I was an anti-communist so they put me in jail for four years. But 
one morning, I ran away. It was a very hard trip. I was in the jungle for nine 
days and nine nights with nothing to eat, no water to drink. I made it to 
Saigon where somebody gave me enough money to buy a boat so I could go to 
Malaysia." Bui plans to help Tran raise funds for her orphanage. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd like to give back," he said. "It's good to be here -- free -- in this 
country." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Cam Ha Bui, who wore an ao dai , a traditional Vietnamese dress, was "one of 
the boat people," she said. "I came over to Malaysia after I was on an open sea 
for eight days with 50 women, 70 men and 80 children." Cam Ha works with 
children in the Head Start Program in the Santa Ana School District. 
</P>
<P>
 Also among guests was Diane Truong, an arts activist married to Dr. Daniel 
Truong -- director of the Parkinson and Movement Disorder Clinic at UCI -- who 
is serving on two local concert committees that will next year mark the 20th 
anniversary of the fall of Saigon. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Pacific Symphony has commissioned a commemorative piece that will be 
performed at the Orange County Performing Arts Center next April," she said. 
"And the Vietnamese community has planned a concert at the Cerritos Center (for 
the Performing Arts) next spring as part of its Project 20" on behalf of the 
anniversary. 
</P>
<P>
 Also enjoying the festivities were architectural designer Alie Chang and her 
husband, Phil Paul, a builder. Chang, who lives in Santa Monica, is known for 
the living environments she has created for show-biz super-celebs such as Rod 
Stewart, Larry Hagman, Hugh Hefner and Merv Adelson. 
</P>
<P>
 But her career is taking a new turn. Chang hopes to become a lifestyle 
commentator, a la Robin Leach, with a television series called "The Art of 
Living." 
</P>
<P>
 She has already filmed March Fong Eu's home for the show. "Actually, I hope to 
do a lot more with my show than Leach has done with his," she said. "He has 
stayed on the comfort side of things. I want to show lifestyles and how people 
made it -- portray their hardships and their philosophies of life." 
</P>
<P>
 Also among guests were Gayle Anderson, Orange County chief of protocol; David 
Tran, owner of a 20,000-square-foot supermarket in Little Saigon; and Irv and 
Julia Rappaport, who recently returned from a trip to Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 "Get to the Mekong River Delta soon ," Irv Rappaport told guests. "It is 
perfectly beautiful. But it won't be long before it is exploited. 
</P>
<P>
 "In Vietnam, you have a group of people who are highly intelligent with a 
tremendous work ethic. Labor is cheap, so it will be exploited to the fullest 
rather quickly."

JACK SMITH: DON'T STOP PRESSES ON HIGH SCHOOL NEWSPAPERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jack Smith 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A story in the paper the other day reported that high school newspapers are an 
endangered species, mostly for lack of money. 
</P>
<P>
 Not surprisingly, this story followed by a few days one noting that daily 
newspapers themselves are in decline, mostly because of television and an 
increasingly illiterate public. 
</P>
<P>
 One way to speed the process of deterioration is to kill high school 
newspapers because they not only influence young people to go into journalism, 
but they help get their classmates into the habit of reading newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
 To me, the end of newspapers would be the end of democracy. As Thomas 
Jefferson said, "Were it left to me to decide whether we should have a 
government without newspapers or newspapers without a government, I should not 
hesitate a moment to prefer the latter." 
</P>
<P>
 I am particularly protective of high school newspapers because I started my 
long and rewarding career on one. I was a reporter and then editor of the 
Belmont High School Sentinel, up on old Crown Hill. (Being editor of the 
Sentinel was to this day the highest position I have ever held in journalism.) 
</P>
<P>
 I read that high school newspapers are floundering not only because the 
schools have no money for them, but because few teachers care to teach 
journalism, or know how. 
</P>
<P>
 It is true that journalism teachers are hard to find. Anyone who is in 
journalism stays in journalism, since it is more fun and probably pays more 
than teaching. Most journalism teachers are English teachers with the bad luck 
to be stuck with a job none of their colleagues want. 
</P>
<P>
 Our journalism teacher at Belmont was a Miss Hubbard. (If she had a first name 
we never heard it.) She seemed quite old to us but was probably only about 40. 
She obviously knew nothing about newspaper work and didn't pretend that she 
did. 
</P>
<P>
 It must have been a thankless job trying to teach journalism to a bunch of 
maverick kids who had recently seen the movie "The Front Page" and thought they 
knew how newspaper reporters ought to act. 
</P>
<P>
 I was especially shaped by that picture. Hildy Johnson, the hero, was a brash, 
fast-talking, unscrupulous police reporter whose job was more important to him 
than his fiancee. He was my role model. I wanted to be just like him, and I 
became just like him -- all except unscrupulous. 
</P>
<P>
 We kept poor Miss Hubbard in a state of constant dismay. She used to fan her 
face and roll her eyes. She wore dresses down to her ankles, but so did all the 
girls in school. If a girl had shown up in a mid-thigh skirt like those in 
fashion today, she would have been sent home in disgrace. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sentinel was not a good paper, but it was ours. I remember once writing an 
editorial, full of juvenile satire, about how to disrupt the peace and quiet of 
the school library. 
</P>
<P>
 I had a loyalty to the Sentinel like that I had for each of the various 
newspapers I worked for later. The paper was, in fact, my conscience and my 
love. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, we never wrote anything critical of the administration. I wouldn't 
say we were censored, but it was understood that certain subjects were taboo. 
High school newspapers are more openly critical today, but evidently they are 
still subject to stern censorship. 
</P>
<P>
 According to a recent release by the Freedom Forum: "High school newspapers 
too often are house organs for school administrators, with student expression 
squelched and censored even on trivial issues, according to a comprehensive 
study of high school journalism. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, one foolproof way to squelch protest in high school newspapers is 
to stop their publication, ostensibly for lack of money. School administrators 
would like to have school papers off their backs, just as Presidents would like 
to have the national press off their backs. 
</P>
<P>
 Obviously, a high school newspaper is no more exempt from libel laws than your 
daily newspaper. That is why high school journalism teachers should be trained 
in the law of the press and teach it to their students. Also, the teacher 
should be able to censor libelous stories just as a daily's managing editor 
can. 
</P>
<P>
 The news in the Sentinel in my era was pretty tame. Campus life was tame. No 
shootings. No visible drugs. No pregnancies (that we ever heard of). There was 
very little racial tension, although Belmont was a melting pot, as it is today. 
</P>
<P>
 I hate to see high school newspapers die. They are the training ground for the 
Hildy Johnsons of the future. They can teach reporters to be not only brash, 
but also fair and responsible. If I had it to do over again, I'd write an 
editorial for the Sentinel along these lines: 
</P>
<P>
 "Why do our girls wear skirts to around their ankles? Don't they have pretty 
legs? This is 1934, not 1894. Come on, girls. Loosen up! Let us see those 
knees!" 
</P>
<P>
 I'm afraid Miss Hubbard would have been in shock.

DISNEY PRESIDENT WELLS KILLED IN COPTER CRASH; ACCIDENT: EXECUTIVE WAS AMONG 
THREE WHO DIED ON NEVADA SKIING TRIP. HE IS CREDITED WITH HELPING FIRM ACHIEVE 
NEW PROSPERITY. WORD OF HIS DEATH STUNS ANAHEIM CIVIC LEADERS. 
</P>

<P>
 Frank G. Wells, the president and chief operating officer of the Walt Disney 
Co. and a key part of one of the biggest turnarounds in American corporate 
history, was killed in a helicopter crash Sunday during a skiing expedition in 
the rugged Ruby Mountains in northeast Nevada.  
</P>
<P>
 Wells, 62, and four others were aboard the helicopter when it went down in a 
remote mountainside known as Thorpe Creek Canyon, about five miles south of 
Lamoille, members of the search party said. 
</P>
<P>
 The pilot, Dave Walton, and Beverly Johnson, of Los Angeles and Wyoming, also 
died in the crash. Johnson's husband, Mike Hoover, and their ski guide were 
injured and taken to a hospital, Elko County Sheriff Neil Harris said. The 
injured were in critical condition. 
</P>
<P>
 Word of Wells' death stunned civic leaders in Anaheim, the city whose identity 
and fortunes have been closely linked to Disney, which opened its fabled 
amusement park there in 1955. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a major loss to both the Disney corporation and the city of Anaheim," 
Mayor Tom Daly said Sunday night. "We have a close working relationship with 
Disney, so any significant loss to Disney effects the city. On behalf of the 
city of Anaheim, I would pass along to (Wells') family and friends and business 
associates our sorrow." 
</P>
<P>
 Daly added that Wells "leaves a legacy here in Anaheim and in Orange County 
because along with the resurgence of the Disney corporation, which he helped to 
lead, Disney has continued to invest here." 
</P>
<P>
 He noted such projects as Westcot, the restoration of the Disneyland motel, 
recent investment by Disney along the Newport Coast and the success of the 
Mighty Ducks of Anaheim.  
</P>
<P>
 "He's going to be missed," Anaheim City Councilman Fred Hunter said. "Of 
course, when anybody of that magnitude is lost, you can't say it won't have any 
effect on things." 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson and Hoover are award-winning documentary filmmakers, sources said. 
They had filmed the guerrilla war in Afghanistan and their work appeared often 
on CBS News. Both were avid climbers and made several films about the 
expeditions. Hoover's short documentary, "Up," won an Academy Award in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
 The group had been heli-skiing in mountains where expert skiers travel for 
powdery slopes untouched by other skiers, officials said. Wells, at 6 feet 4 
inches, was an accomplished mountaineer who had climbed the highest peak on 
every continent, and had reached the summit of each one -- except Mt. Everest. 
</P>
<P>
 Wells had gone to Lamoille with his son Kevin for an Easter ski vacation, said 
a representative of Ruby Mountain Heli-Ski, the helicopter company, but his son 
was not aboard the copter when it crashed about 4:30 p.m. local time. 
</P>
<P>
 Actor-director Clint Eastwood was on the weekend trip as well, but he had left 
to return to his Carmel home an hour before the crash that claimed the life of 
Wells, who was his good friend and former attorney, said Eastwood's agent, 
Leonard Hirshan of the William Morris agency. 
</P>
<P>
 The death of Wells was expected to send shock waves through an industry where 
management stability is rare. Wells and Disney Chairman Michael D. Eisner had 
become the model of such stability: their 10-year reign is a rarity in a 
business with high and frequent executive turnover. "There are no words to 
express my shock and sense of loss," Eisner said in a statement late Sunday 
night. "Frank Wells has been the purest definition of a 'life force' I have 
ever known. 
</P>
<P>
 "His wisdom, his charm, his zest for experience and challenge . . . his naked 
and awesome intelligence . . . set him apart and beyond. The world has lost a 
great human being." 
</P>
<P>
 Wells, a California native, Rhodes scholar and former entertainment lawyer, 
was often overshadowed by the high-profile Eisner, but nonetheless was 
considered critical to Disney's turnaround that started when the two were named 
in 1984 after a struggle for Disney that threatened to break up the venerable 
Burbank company. 
</P>
<P>
 Even before the revival of Disney's fortunes -- the company's market value 
leaped from $2 billion to $22 billion between 1984 and late 1992 -- Wells had a 
long history in the movie industry, including more than a decade at Warner 
Bros., where he began in 1966 as a vice president. He served as vice president 
and chairman of that company before he left in 1984 to join Disney. 
</P>
<P>
 The partnership served both Wells and Disney well. In 1990, Wells was the 
highest-salaried Californian, with total compensation from salary bonus and 
stock options of nearly $51 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Wells was also known as a bold mountain climber, who in 1981 set himself the 
goal of climbing the highest mountain on each of the globe's seven continents. 
He took a leave from Warner Bros. to co-author a book about the experience, 
"Seven Summits." 
</P>
<P>
 As an undergraduate at Pomona College, which he attended with Roy Disney, Walt 
Disney's nephew, he had fantasized about being the first to conquer Everest -- 
until a fraternity brother told him one day in 1953, "Well, we blew it. Some 
guy named Hillary just climbed it." 
</P>
<P>
 As a Rhodes scholar at Oxford University, he and a friend bought a private 
plane over one spring vacation to fly to South Africa and back. They only got 
as far as a crash-landing in East Africa. 
</P>
<P>
 For all his button-down resume, Wells had an adventuresome spirit. The son of 
a Navy officer who spent much of his childhood living on Navy bases, he played 
championship high school football in Coronado, and in college played basketball 
and water polo. 
</P>
<P>
 A Stanford University law school graduate, Wells had been a partner in the 
Hollywood law firm of Gang, Tyre & Brown, which specializes in entertainment 
industry law. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, Wells had also earned a reputation as a behind-the-scenes 
mover in the effort to enact forestry protection legislation in Northern 
California, backing a legislative effort that he termed "critical." 
</P>
<P>
 Wells' stewardship at Disney began in 1984. In a coup eventually led by Wells' 
former classmate, Roy Disney, the company's regime was ousted, and Eisner and 
Wells were brought in to salvage the operation. 
</P>
<P>
 They, along with other executives, turned the complacent company around, 
making the theme parks more profitable and turning out such popular films as 
"Pretty Woman," "Beauty and the Beast" and "Aladdin." 
</P>
<P>
 Until last year, when EuroDisney suffered losses, the Eisner-Wells partnership 
had been pure gold. 
</P>
<P>
 The politically active Wells was one of the key business executives who 
stepped forward to support President Clinton during the 1992 campaign when 
Clinton was looking for backing from business leaders for his economic plan. 
</P>
<P>
 In Sunday's accident, according to local authorities, the control tower at J. 
C. Harris Field in Elko, 20 miles from the crash site, received a report at 
about 4 p.m. that a helicopter belonging to Ruby Mountain Heli-Ski was having 
engine trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 Search and rescue crews immediately mobilized at Lamoille, at the base of the 
mountain range, which is in Humboldt National Forest. They reached the site of 
the crash shortly afterward in helicopters. 
</P>
<P>
 "The pilot did the best he could when the engine quit," Hoover told rescuers, 
according to Ted McBride, who piloted the rescue craft. 
</P>
<P>
 The two survivors were transported to Elko General Hospital, where they were 
listed in critical condition. They were flown to Washoe County Medical Center 
in Reno. 
</P>
<P>
 The survivors were Johnson's husband and Paul Scannell. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson and Hoover claimed addresses in both Kelly, Wyo., and Los Angeles, 
Harris said. Scannell was the ski guide for Ruby Mountain Heli-Ski. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruby Mountain Heli-Ski has operated in the area for more than 10 years, 
transporting skiers to various landing pads in the mountains above Lamoille.  
</P>
<P>
 A woman who answered the telephone Sunday evening at the company's office in 
Lamoille refused to comment on the accident. 
</P>
<P>
 Wells' party, which included Eastwood and other Disney executives, according 
to sources, had spent two nights in a guest house at Red's Ranch in Lamoille, a 
spokesman for the ranch said.

slopes Sunday afternoon, snow and squalls had developed in the upper reaches of 
the mountains. "The weather got bad, so they (the ski company's helicopters) 
came back to take them off the mountain," the sheriff said. 
</P>
<P>
 The first helicopter made it back safely but the one carrying Wells and other 
members of his party reportedly developed engine trouble.

CITIZEN KATE: A RUN AGAINST THE CONVENTIONAL WISDOM; POLITICS: KATE SQUIRES' 
LONG-SHOT SENATE BID STRUGGLES TO BE HEARD OVER THE VOLUME OF BIG-MONEY 
CAMPAIGNS.

<P>
 Deep in America's imagination there exists an ideal politician. 
</P>
<P>
 He is an ordinary citizen, like the one Jimmy Stewart played in "Mr. Smith 
Goes to Washington." When he volunteers to serve, he is unsullied by sleaze and 
untainted by self-interest. He knows nothing about politics. But, as in "Dave" 
-- the central character of the 1993 movie about an average Joe who fills in 
for the President -- his ignorance only makes him more effective as he relies 
on common sense to get things done. 
</P>
<P>
 This year in California, Kate Squires and dozens of other unknowns are trying 
to live out this fantasy. Squires, a 35-year-old Riverside County lawyer and 
businesswoman, is making an earnest bid to take on U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein. 
Squires has little money, no political experience, and campaign experts say she 
has absolutely no chance of winning her first race for office. 
</P>
<P>
 This angers Squires, who is particularly frustrated that newspapers give her 
so little attention. Hardly a week goes by without her better-financed 
Republican opponents -- Rep. Michael Huffington and former Rep. William E. 
Dannemeyer -- getting a mention, she notes. If only she could get the coverage, 
she believes she could be a contender. 
</P>
<P>
 For Squires and other amateur candidates, the difficulty of getting anyone to 
listen affirms an abiding cynicism about the corruption of money in politics 
and the failure of the media to do anything about it. For many who study 
American government, however, the obstacles in Squires' path are evidence that 
democracy is working just about as it should. 
</P>
<P>
 For better or worse, the story of Squires' struggle to run for office tells 
much about the realities of politics in California today. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Rod Squires admits he was caught off guard when his wife revealed her 
political aspirations in September. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wasn't surprised about her running for office -- she's always been very 
achievement-oriented," said Rod, who owns a wholesale and retail distribution 
company in Riverside. "But this office in particular was a surprise." 
</P>
<P>
 After all, Kate Squires had never held a local seat. Rod never doubted her 
skills -- "I know Kate's debating abilities, and they're far superior to 
Dannemeyer's or Huffington's," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the U.S. Senate seemed like a big leap until the fledgling candidate 
revealed the strategy that would become the central tenet of her campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Only a Republican woman can beat Feinstein, she told her husband. Huffington 
had personal wealth, Dannemeyer had a conservative track record, but Squires 
believed she alone had what it would take to prevail: femininity. 
</P>
<P>
 "Feinstein's voting record is very liberal down the line, but she gets up 
there and uses her gender like a smoke screen," said the self-described former 
feminist, whose platform is a compendium of far-right positions ranging from 
prayer in schools to cutting welfare and ending federally funded abortions. "If 
we can remove that, neutralize her radical feminism and call her on her 
'sisterhood' . . . people will start to ask about the issues." 
</P>
<P>
 The strategy appealed to Rod. So did the untraditional way his wife planned to 
carry it out. In a state as large and diverse as this one, where expensive 
broadcast advertising is considered essential to reach millions of voters, she 
had decided to try to talk to them directly. 
</P>
<P>
 "Her idea of stumping the state instead of just appealing to the couch 
potatoes -- I knew she could win people over," he said proudly, predicting that 
Squires' "back to basics" approach would make victory even sweeter. "It would 
definitely reaffirm in people the idea that just because you've got the biggest 
bucks, you don't get to win. That's what I get excited about -- that 
possibility." 
</P>
<P>
 The notion is romantic. Experts say it is also unrealistic. Consider this: to 
introduce herself to California's electorate without the help of paid 
advertising, Squires would have to shake 39,726 hands every day for a year.  
</P>
<P>
 "This isn't Iowa. This isn't North Dakota. This is California -- 15 million 
voters. It's necessarily politics that's conducted by the media and by direct 
mail, politics that requires large amounts of money," said UC Berkeley 
political science professor Bruce Cain. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to put down the feeling of ill ease that people have about a 
system that is so electronically centered and money-centered. It is 
unfortunate," Cain said. "But I don't know what the alternative is in a state 
of 32 million people. . . . No matter how many teas (Squires) goes to, she's 
not going to meet even a fraction of the voters she needs to meet." 
</P>
<P>
 But Squires, a sharp-tongued debater who owns a company that prepares students 
for law school, is not easily discouraged. While Huffington has taken to the 
airwaves, spending more than $1 million of an estimated $15-million campaign 
budget, she has continued to try to connect, one on one, with individual 
voters. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sorry -- money is not my god," she told five Riverside County supporters 
over coffee one recent morning. "We have been led to believe that the only way 
to win a state this large is with money. But I have not bought into that 
conventional wisdom. I really believe it discounts what our democratic process 
is all about. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just keep spreading the word," she implored. "Isn't it more valuable to have 
your friend say, 'Vote for Kate,' than to see a paid-for-TV ad? . . . Let's 
stop worshiping the money god. Let's blow them away with people power." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At last count, contributions to Squires' campaign totaled about $20,000. She 
has no paid staff and often drives herself around the state in a borrowed van. 
She jokes that because of her grueling schedule and minimal budget, running for 
the Senate keeps her slimmer than dieting. 
</P>
<P>
 "We work for food," Squires says of her Senate-on-a-shoestring campaign. 
"We're not rich, but . . . we're committed." 
</P>
<P>
 Since she hit the campaign trail six months ago, the Corona resident has worn 
her relative poverty like a badge of honor. She believes that good ideas are 
all a candidate truly needs. Money and political experience may seem essential 
to political insiders, she says, but she would prefer to win the June 7 
Republican primary without them. 
</P>
<P>
 "What experience are you talking about? If it is the experience of having been 
in D.C. in the Congress for 12 or 15 years, I don't want it," said Squires, 
whose campaign slogan reads: "Straight Talk and Simple Truth!" "I don't want to 
be infringed. I don't want to be sold out. I don't want to be tainted." 
</P>
<P>
 Experts say that in her attempt to avoid taint, Squires has denied herself an 
essential education. Although many people believe that "any idiot in the phone 
book can do better than the bozos in Sacramento," Cain of UC Berkeley says it 
takes know-how to govern well. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of political scientists, including myself, believe that by the time you 
get to the highest level of government, there are enormously complicated issues 
that do require some level of expertise," Cain said. "We are very worried about 
the notion that anybody could run government. That just isn't true." 
</P>
<P>
 Undeniably, experience is not a prerequisite for aspiring politicians. 
Personal wealth, like Huffington's, can help propel an unknown into office. If 
you are an entertainer-turned-politician like Ronald Reagan or Sonny Bono, 
celebrity can provide a leg up. Or sometimes a single dramatic incident can 
boost one's political capital. Former U.S. Sen. S. I. Hayakawa was catapulted 
into politics after television cameras recorded his attempts to stop a student 
uprising at San Francisco State University, where he was president. 
</P>
<P>
 For most people, however, becoming a serious candidate means paying political 
dues. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are leagues in politics. Senators have been congressmen, congressmen 
have been mayors. There's no better way (to become a viable candidate) than to 
go through the chairs," said pollster Mervin Field. "This idea that 'I'm a 
citizen politician and it's my turn to serve' -- that's fine, but . . . 
candidates have to demonstrate that they're capable." 
</P>
<P>
 Here again, money plays a role. Even political veterans who lament that 
fund-raising has become too big a part of the electoral process say that when 
taking the measure of a candidate -- particularly a first-timer -- money cannot 
be ignored. Like it or not, a fat campaign war chest is often the best proof 
that an untested candidate inspires confidence. 
</P>
<P>
 "Somebody like Kate Squires has got to prove that people will support her, and 
one way to support her is to put up money," Field said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ken Khachigian, a Republican political consultant who is an adviser to 
Huffington's campaign, said Squires would make a great candidate for the state 
Legislature or Congress. But she has taken on too much by running for statewide 
office first time out, he said, and she should not blame the system for her own 
bad decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "Abe Lincoln ran for local office. George Washington was a general. Franklin 
Roosevelt was assistant secretary of the Navy and then governor of New York. 
Nixon came up through Congress," Khachigian said. "The system is frustrating -- 
I hate the money-raising -- but it usually does sort out people who do not 
display extraordinary leadership qualities." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Not everyone thinks Squires is misguided. Caltech political science professor 
Rod Kiewiet has published a paper about people like Squires, who are the basis 
for what he calls "the rational turkey theory." In short, the theory says there 
is logic to a weak candidate running against a formidable opponent because the 
field is usually less crowded. Then, if the formidable opponent gets struck by 
lightning, the turkey can step into the void.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's a long shot, but it's not a zero shot," said Kiewiet, adding that 
America's deep-rooted fondness for the underdog can aid such candidates as 
well. "People do love to see major upsets. Think of the New York Jets in 1969. 
Every so often some pure chump like Buster Douglas will beat a champion like 
Mike Tyson." 
</P>
<P>
 For the record, Squires sees herself as neither a turkey nor a chump. Instead, 
she likens herself to a horse -- a Trojan horse. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are like the Trojan horse going into Dianne Feinstein's camp," she likes 
to say, explaining that as a conservative candidate in a woman's body, she 
believes she can "strike at the heart" of Feinstein's voters. 
</P>
<P>
 Squires' populist rhetoric has touched some people. Kathy Turner, a 
31-year-old businesswoman and mother of three who is active in the Riverside 
County Young Republicans chapter, said she is supporting Squires because of her 
"trickle-up" campaign style. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can no longer rely on the high-end donors, the media. We have to start in 
the community," said Turner, who admires Squires for trying to do that. "She's 
a go-getter. If she works this hard in the Senate, we can get a lot of things 
accomplished." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, there is no evidence that Squires has stolen any of Feinstein's 
support. A Field Poll conducted in January simulated the general election, 
pairing Feinstein first against Dannemeyer, then Huffington, then Squires. In 
each pairing, Feinstein's numbers stayed nearly constant -- 53% or 54% of 
registered voters said they would vote for her. 
</P>
<P>
 In a recent Los Angeles Times poll, Republicans indicated that none of their 
party's participants is particularly well known. If the Republican primary were 
held today, 22% said they would vote for Dannemeyer, 13% for Huffington and 7% 
for Squires. A whopping 58% was undecided. 
</P>
<P>
 Squires is hardly the first to try to beat the odds. And a handful have won. 
In 1990, Paul Wellstone, a political science professor, defeated U.S. Sen. Rudy 
Boschwitz (R-Minn.), a well-financed, two-term incumbent. 
</P>
<P>
 But Californians outnumber Minnesotans seven to one. Had Wellstone run in the 
Golden State instead of the Gopher State, experts say he would not have fared 
as well. Just ask Jim Trinity. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, Trinity, a retired Glendale dentist and first-time candidate, ran 
unsuccessfully for the same U.S. Senate seat that Squires hopes to occupy. Like 
Squires, Trinity counted Dannemeyer among his challengers for the Republican 
nomination (incumbent John Seymour and a long shot named Bill Allen were the 
other two). Had he been successful, Trinity would have faced the same Democrat 
in the general election: Feinstein.  
</P>
<P>
 Trinity, like Squires, was short on cash -- he raised only about $15,000 
(supplemented by $200,000 of his own money). And like Squires, Trinity blamed 
his lack of renown largely on the media. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a Catch-22," he said during the campaign. "If you are not written up, 
you don't make the polls. If you are not in the polls, you are not going to be 
written about. You have to have a hell of a lot of perseverance." 
</P>
<P>
 Squires is not a quitter. "I'm convinced people will make a difference. I'm 
standing firm on that rock," Squires says optimistically, explaining how she 
has focused on cultivating as many Republican activists as she can -- "the 
movers and shakers," she says, "that are going to get out there and penetrate. 
" 
</P>
<P>
 Statewide, Squires boasts of what she calls a "huge" grass-roots organization 
of about 100 such penetrating souls. She seems genuinely hopeful that they will 
get her message out. But so far, Squires has gotten more attention for fainting 
than for anything else. 
</P>
<P>
 It happened at the California Republican Party convention in February, when 
Squires appeared on a meet-the-candidates panel. Midway through a fiery speech 
in which she railed against taxes, welfare and the endangered species list, 
Squires grew pale and fell to the floor. 
</P>
<P>
 Dannemeyer ran to her aid, with Huffington right behind him. A doctor jumped 
on stage and someone in the crowd began reciting the Lord's Prayer. Minutes 
later, when Squires returned to the microphone, the little-known contender 
seemed determined to turn an embarrassing moment into a valuable one. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to apologize . . . because that's not what you wanted in a United 
States Senate candidate," she said. Then, emboldened by a roar of applause, she 
added: "Or maybe it is. Maybe that's a good way to get the floor to pay 
attention." Defying the Odds? 
</P>
<P>
 It happens every election year: a handful of average citizens set out to fix 
what's broken in government. Often low on funds, short on name recognition and 
lacking in political experience, these candidates are powered mostly by their 
own earnestness. Here is a list of some of the lesser-known contenders who have 
qualified to appear on the June 7 primary ballot. FOR GOVERNOR

U.S. REFUSES TO CURB NEW SERB ATTACKS; BALKANS: AS BOSNIA AGGRESSION AND 
'ETHNIC CLEANSING' GO ON, PERRY REJECTS ANY NEW AMERICAN TROOP COMMITMENT. HIS 
COMMENTS FOLLOW PLEA FOR HELP FROM MUSLIM LEADER. 
</P>

<P>
 With Bosnian Serb forces pressing attacks on the Muslim and Croatian 
populations in at least two Bosnian cities, Defense Secretary William J. Perry 
on Sunday ruled out the use of U.S. troops to prevent the Serbs from capturing 
additional territory. 
</P>
<P>
 While Christians in the capital of Sarajevo observed their first peaceful 
Easter Sunday in two years, Bosnian Serb forces bombarded the city of Gorazde 
in southeastern Bosnia-Herzegovina for the sixth day. 
</P>
<P>
 In the bombardment and infantry battles around the Muslim enclave, where 
65,000 people are trapped, the toll rose to at least 10 people killed and 120 
wounded, according to U.N. peacekeeping forces in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 And in northern Bosnia, the Serbs continued to press what is being called a 
ferocious campaign of "ethnic cleansing" in the Banja Luka area, including the 
town of Prijedor. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked whether the United States will consider air strikes or armed 
intervention to curb further such actions by Serbian forces, Perry declared 
pointedly, "We will not enter the war to stop that from happening." 
</P>
<P>
 Prijedor was the scene last week of a renewed terror campaign by Bosnian Serbs 
that is believed to have claimed the lives of 17 Muslims and three Croats. U.N. 
officials reported that more people were forced from their homes in Prijedor on 
Saturday, and one person reportedly died of wounds suffered Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the weekend, U.N. officials reported that Serbian militants had 
firebombed houses and forced Muslims from their homes in Sipovo and forcibly 
evicted others in Vrbanja, both Banja Luka suburbs. 
</P>
<P>
 The Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees has accused Bosnian Serb 
authorities of allowing the attacks, and the Red Cross is planning the 
evacuation of Croats and Muslims from Prijedor. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday, Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic ordered his forces to arrest 
those responsible for the attacks in Prijedor and guaranteed safe passage for 
evacuees. 
</P>
<P>
 Perry's comments on NBC-TV's "Meet the Press" followed a plea on the same 
program from Bosnia's Muslim prime minister, Haris Silajdzic, for U.S. military 
intervention in the 2-year-old conflict. 
</P>
<P>
 "The answer is, use force. . . . Otherwise, this is going to be a very, very 
long and bloody peace," Silajdzic said. "(Use) air strikes. When they (Serbs) 
kill innocent people, they should be punished for that, and they will not stop 
until they are punished." 
</P>
<P>
 Lt. Gen. Michael Rose, the commander of U.N. peacekeeping forces in Bosnia, 
said on the same program that the addition of U.S. troops would "of course" 
help in quelling the conflict. 
</P>
<P>
 "The arrival of any troops here will help that peace process," Rose said. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States has not sent any ground troops to Bosnia, maintaining that a 
durable settlement must be in place before it risks deploying troops there. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday, Perry said the United States will go no further, militarily, to 
halt a Bosnian Serb offensive that appears aimed at consolidating gains before 
any peace agreement is struck. Indeed, Perry confirmed that Washington is 
"trying to hold down the total costs involved" in peacekeeping operations in 
the former Yugoslav federation. 
</P>
<P>
 Commenting on a range of U.S. national security challenges, Perry also ruled 
out preemptive U.S. strikes on North Korean nuclear facilities at this time. 
But he warned that fighting could break out on the Korean Peninsula, with 
catastrophic consequences, as North Korea reacts to increased diplomatic and 
economic pressure from the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Noting that U.S. intelligence agencies believe that North Korea now has built 
as many as two nuclear bombs, Perry outlined a step-by-step U.S. diplomatic 
strategy designed, first, to freeze the North Korean nuclear program in place 
and only then to "roll. . . back the program they have." 
</P>
<P>
 "We will not have a preemptive military strike at this time and under these 
circumstances," Perry said. But he added: "I am not ruling that option out in 
the future." 
</P>
<P>
 Perry said the United States could step up its diplomatic efforts to bring 
North Korea to heel with "considerable pressure," including additional economic 
sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
 "That will increase the risk" that the North Koreans will respond with a 
military assault on the south, he warned. "And because it will increase the 
risk, we will increase our defensive forces as needed to prudently protect 
ourselves against that risk."

AMID BAD NEWS, POPE CELEBRATES THE JOY OF EASTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM D. MONTALBANO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Thunderheads riding a cold wind roared above St. Peter's Square. Rain lashed 
worshipers and a flower-draped altar before the giant church, auguring perhaps 
a bittersweet Easter for an aging Pope. 
</P>
<P>
 Pilgrims and cardinals alike huddled under umbrellas against the storm Sunday 
as John Paul II celebrated the Resurrection of Christ at his annual outdoor 
Mass, a spring festival overtaken this year by winter's return -- and 
disappointing news for history's most-traveled Pope. 
</P>
<P>
 A long-bruited visit to the Holy Land that John Paul has called his "greatest 
dream" will not be possible anytime soon, the ranking Roman Catholic Church 
official in Jerusalem cautioned Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 And, The Times has learned, Vatican officials are preparing to cancel a 
long-planned papal visit to Lebanon in June because of security concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday's storm did not diminish either the number of Easter pilgrims excitedly 
filling the cobblestoned piazza before the basilica or their enthusiasm for the 
white-haired leader of the world's 900 million Catholics. 
</P>
<P>
 John Paul, 74 next month and increasingly stooped, greeted the sodden 
multitude clear-eyed and strong-voiced in a magnificent white robe trimmed in 
red. 
</P>
<P>
 "May love triumph over hate! The peoples enervated by material and moral 
poverty thirst for security and peace. When will people finally be able to live 
as brothers and sisters in harmony with one another?" John Paul demanded from 
the balcony of St. Peter's in his annual Urbi et Orbi message (To the City and 
the World). 
</P>
<P>
 History's first Polish Pope, who began his extraordinary reign in 1978, 
preached a message of peace and understanding. He urged support for the family 
and for communities around the world united by shared moral values. 
</P>
<P>
 "Humanity needs Christ: He is the source of peace, of the life that knows no 
death," John Paul said. "May this joyful announcement resound especially in 
Jerusalem, as it did the first time. 
</P>
<P>
 "May it resound in the Balkans, in the Caucasus, in Africa and in Asia and in 
all the nations where the din of weapons still continues, where nationalism 
arouses dangerous forms of evil extremism, where races and social classes 
endlessly oppose one another.  
</P>
<P>
 "May this proclamation of peace inspire all those in the wealthy societies who 
are trying to give a meaning to life and to organize civil society on the 
foundation of values more in keeping with the dignity of man and his 
transcendent vocation," John Paul prayed. 
</P>
<P>
 Jerusalem, site of Christ's Crucifixion, is the city that the Pope would most 
like to visit. It would be the culmination of his papacy, he has often said. 
</P>
<P>
 John Paul personally directed two years of quiet diplomacy that led to an 
agreement Dec. 30 between the Vatican and Israel to open full diplomatic 
relations. Since then, Vatican diplomats have worked behind the scenes to 
encourage progress in peace talks between Israelis and Palestinians. John Paul 
defends both the rights of Palestinians for a homeland and that of Jews for 
their own state.

 "It must be understood that Jews, who for 2,000 years were dispersed among the 
nations of the world, had decided to return to the land of their ancestors. 
This is their right," John Paul told correspondent Tad Szulc in an 
unprecedented interview published in Parade magazine Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the fresh Israeli-Palestinian understandings, it is premature for a 
papal pilgrimage to the Holy Land because "there was no progress in people's 
hearts," Michael Sabbah, Roman Catholic patriarch of Jerusalem, said in an 
interview Sunday with Italian national radio. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the Christians of Bethlehem can reach Jerusalem without the permission 
of a military governor, when they and all the other inhabitants of the occupied 
territories are free and not subject to such severe security measures -- then 
we can think about a papal visit," said Sabbah, a Palestinian. 
</P>
<P>
 Seeking an evenhanded role in the volatile Middle East, John Paul also seeks 
to protect Christian communities in Arab countries. Largest among them is 
Lebanon, a repeated focus of public papal prayers during its civil war. 
</P>
<P>
 At papal insistence, Vatican planners had cobbled together a visit there for 
the first days of June. Now, however, Vatican sources say the trip will be 
scrapped. 
</P>
<P>
 A bomb that killed 10 worshipers and wounded 60 more at Our Lady of Salvation 
Church just north of Beirut in February short-circuited the visit, they say. 
</P>
<P>
 The concern is less for papal safety than that public events marking his 
presence might invite a terrorist attack, the sources say. Citing rising ethnic 
tensions, Lebanese bishops who invited the Pope now believe that it is wiser if 
he does not come, The Times has learned. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the tens of thousands massed before St. Peter's on Sunday to see John 
Paul were peace marchers led by the mayors of 86 European cities. 
</P>
<P>
 Continuing an Easter tradition as part of a message broadcast around the 
world, John Paul offered greetings in 57 languages, including English, Hebrew, 
Arabic, Tamil, Urdu, Chinese, Vietnamese, Czech, Croatian, Greek, Albanian, 
Slovene, Estonian and Esperanto.

IDAHO TUG-OF-WAR PITS WILD AGAINST WILD BLUE YONDER; MILITARY: ODD COALITION 
WANTS TO SHOOT DOWN PLAN TO TURN 13,000 ACRES INTO AN AIR FORCE BOMBING RANGE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 The stark moonscape of Idaho's southwest corner can be so quiet that Craig 
Gehrke, an environmentalist who camps and hikes in the area, says you can stand 
in the vastness and hear the true sound of silence: the steady, rhythmic whoosh 
of blood in your ears. 
</P>
<P>
 This stretch of high, rocky desert, cleaved deeply by dramatic canyons, is 
sacred to the Shoshone-Paiute Indians settled on a reservation nearby. It is 
home to about 35 rare species of plants and animals. It's an area so wild and 
remote that the Interior Department has deemed it suitable for federal 
protection as a national wilderness area. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Air Force and Idaho's governor have their way, however, the silence and 
solitude of Idaho's Owyhee Canyonlands will be broken at least five days a 
month by the "sound of freedom" -- the roar, thud and shriek of up to 80 
warplanes flying at supersonic speeds, dropping dummy bombs and maneuvering out 
of reach of mock antiaircraft fire. 
</P>
<P>
 Under a complex land swap conceived and pushed by one the nation's most 
environmentally minded governors, the state would take possession of 13,000 
acres of southwest Idaho owned by the Interior Department. Gov. Cecil D. 
Andrus, acting as middleman, would then turn the land over to the 366th Wing 
"Gunfighters" of Mountain Home Air Force Base for conversion into the Idaho 
Bomb Range. 
</P>
<P>
 The Air Force would spend $26 million to buy equipment and privately owned 
land adjoining the site, improve roads and build the bomb range. It would then 
become one of four major target ranges within a 70-minute flight of the 
Mountain Home base. 
</P>
<P>
 But a coalition of federal officials, environmentalists, Native Americans and 
big-game hunters -- as well as some of Andrus' own state officials -- are 
looking to shoot down the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 The test of wills, which could wind up being arbitrated by Congress, 
represents just one corner of a national battleground between the post-Cold War 
Pentagon and environmentalists. 
</P>
<P>
 As the shrinking U.S. military draws its forces home from places such as 
Europe and the Philippines, it is seeking to step up activities and expand 
territory for maneuvers and training throughout the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Such domestic tracts need to be large enough for jets, tanks and other 
military equipment to practice fast-moving combat tactics and fire long-range 
weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 In a February, 1993, report issued by Gen. Colin L. Powell, then-chairman of 
the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Pentagon acknowledged that "an integrated test 
and evaluation range structure," linking existing ranges across six Western 
states and areas off the California coast, would be necessary to bring U.S. 
training areas into line "with the changed world." 
</P>
<P>
 But as the military pursues that expansion, it is locking horns with 
environmentalists, who are finding rare common cause with other traditional 
users of federal lands throughout the West, including ranchers, miners and 
hunters. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pentagon is "going berserk right now, and I don't understand it," said 
Grace Bukowski of the Rural Alliance for Military Accountability, a citizens' 
action group that helps organize resistance to the military's expansion into 
public lands. "I thought the Cold War was over." 
</P>
<P>
 The opposition, Bukowski said, is "this strange group of bedfellows who are 
leaving their shotguns at the door and joining forces to fight the military. 
Because when it comes to the military taking over our public lands, we're all 
in agreement: If the military gets it, everyone loses. (The lands are) gone for 
the ranchers, miners, environmentalists and recreationists."  
</P>
<P>
 Gehrke, for one, said he believes that the Idaho situation could represent a 
final push by the Air Force. "I just wonder if this isn't the last big land 
grab -- an effort to get one last range before the curtain closes," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 With 27 million acres in the United States under military control already and 
support for the protection of public lands growing, Gehrke said, "I can't see 
them arguing successfully for more training ranges." 
</P>
<P>
 Skirmishes like the one in Idaho are being played out throughout the nation. 
But the fights have been concentrated in the West, where vast expanses of open 
land and lightly populated areas have increasingly drawn the military. 
</P>
<P>
 * In California, Army plans to expand maneuver areas by 320,000 acres at its 
National Training Center at Ft. Irwin have run headlong into efforts to protect 
the threatened desert tortoise. Legislation advocated by Sen. Dianne Feinstein 
(D-Calif.) would exempt the area around Ft. Irwin, which is prime tortoise 
habitat, from special restrictions to protect the animals. But 
environmentalists continue to press for greater protection. 
</P>
<P>
 * In Arizona, a Marine Corps proposal to increase flight activity over the 
Cabeza Prieta National Wildlife Refuge has drawn strong opposition from 
environmentalists. 
</P>
<P>
 * In Colorado, an Air Force bid to increase low-level flights across the state 
has caused a political uproar and has collided with a state law that 
strengthens protections for new wilderness areas under the military's flight 
path.  
</P>
<P>
 * In New Mexico and Utah, an Army proposal to test-fire Patriot missiles 
across a stretch of pristine desert has environmentalists up in arms. 
</P>
<P>
 * In Alaska, the Air Force and Army are pressing plans for sweeping additions 
to training areas throughout the state, prompting cries of concern about the 
effect on wildlife and native people who hunt for subsistence. 
</P>
<P>
 * In Nevada, the Navy and Air Force have plans to expand two of the nation's 
most extensive bomb ranges -- those associated with Fallon Naval Air Station 
and Nellis Air Force Base. 
</P>
<P>
 At Nellis, the Air Force wants to build a landing strip on 1,400 acres of lake 
bed now used for recreation and ranching. In recent years, Fallon Naval Air 
Station has put forth plans to increase its training ranges more than threefold 
and to double its airspace. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time that the Pentagon is trying to expand its turf in some 
regions, it is being forced to defend its training grounds elsewhere. Last 
year, a group known as Defenders of Wildlife sued the Defense Department to 
stop bombing and aerial combat training at Copalis National Wildlife Refuge on 
Washington state's coastline, an area that is home to endangered stellar sea 
lions. 
</P>
<P>
 Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt intervened to stop the military activity 
there, and Defenders of Wildlife is now striving for legislation to strengthen 
protection from military activities for all national wildlife refuges. In 
recent years, the managers of 72 wildlife refuges in 27 states have warned that 
their areas have suffered from military air exercises and bombing practice. 
</P>
<P>
 In pressing its case, the military has gained a powerful weapon: the threat of 
base closures. For many rural communities dependent on military payrolls, the 
prospect that the shrinking military could pack up and leave is both real and 
frightening. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pentagon has distanced itself from the politically charged decisions over 
base closures by turning them over to an independent commission. 
</P>
<P>
 But the services continue to have a powerful influence in the process because 
the commission's deliberations begin with a list of closure recommendations 
drafted by the military. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, state and local officials know that keeping local base commanders 
happy could spell the difference between economic life and death. 
</P>
<P>
 In Idaho, the fear of economic abandonment by the Air Force is at the heart of 
the bomb range proposal. Andrus says the Mountain Home base is the 
second-biggest employer in his state, with a direct annual payroll of $140 
million and a yearly energy bill with the state's utility of $300 million. 
Roughly 4,000 Air Force and civilian personnel are based at Mountain Home. With 
their families, they make up well over half the population of this old railroad 
town. 
</P>
<P>
 Andrus said he hopes that a new bomb range will forestall any thoughts by the 
Air Force of closing the base. "I would be totally irresponsible as governor of 
this state if I ignored the potential" that the base would close, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 With the state working so hard to expand, "you just cannot turn your back on 
all those jobs" at Mountain Home, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Herb Meyr, a retired lieutenant colonel and fighter pilot who opposes the 
Idaho Bomb Range, called the threat of base closures "economic blackmail" that 
has Andrus and the state over a barrel. 
</P>
<P>
 The Air Force denies that it has made any such threat. "We would like to be 
here a long time," said Brig. Gen. Dave McCloud, commanding officer of the 
366th Wing. But because the base-closure commission and the President have the 
final say in what facilities should close, he added, "it is absolutely out of 
our hands." 
</P>
<P>
 McCloud and other Air Force officials, however, made it clear that the Idaho 
Bomb Range would be counted as another advantage for the base at Mountain Home, 
which already offers good flying conditions and inexpensive living costs for 
personnel. 
</P>
<P>
 McCloud said that by having a new range close to the base, his pilots could 
get out of their planes "still soaking wet" with sweat after bombing exercises. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mountain Home base now has one bombing range nearby, but it is so limited 
that the "Gunfighters" have to use much of their congressionally limited flying 
time to reach ranges in Utah and Nevada for many of their practices. Including 
the time it takes to refuel the jets, the trips take 45 to 70 minutes each way. 
</P>
<P>
 But environmentalists charge that convenience for the Air Force does not 
outweigh the dangers to wildlife, Native American culture and scenery that the 
Idaho Bomb Range poses. 
</P>
<P>
 To the Shoshone-Paiute Indians who live on the border of Idaho and Nevada, all 
the land the Air Force seeks is sacred. Beyond that, a burial ground and many 
religious and cultural sites lie in and around the bombing area. 
</P>
<P>
 In one of the two proposed areas, Air Force contractors found about 400 Indian 
artifacts and sites of potential archeological interest. 
</P>
<P>
 The area over which warplanes would concentrate is habitat for the 
prong-horned antelope and the nation's largest herd of California bighorn 
sheep. 
</P>
<P>
 Both species are considered to be in serious decline, and Idaho's herd of 
bighorn sheep has provided vital transplant stock to replenish populations in 
California and elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, part of the proposed Idaho Bomb Range falls in an area that has been 
deemed suitable for federal wilderness protection, and two rivers that are 
candidates for designation as "wild and scenic rivers" flow between the two 
"impact zones" sought by the Air Force. 
</P>
<P>
 The federal Bureau of Land Management has warned Babbitt that if the Air Force 
plan moves ahead, those areas probably would not satisfy the criteria for 
federal protection. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, the federal government, and possibly Congress, will likely be 
called upon to arbitrate. And that, in turn, could set off a war of wills 
between Babbitt and the Air Force -- whose secretary, Sheila Widnall, strongly 
supports the new range. 
</P>
<P>
 While Babbitt has not yet spoken out publicly on the issue, he is being urged 
by many advisers and some lawmakers to block the transfer of land to Idaho. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, the Idaho Fish and Game Board -- whose members are named by the 
governor -- recommended against proceeding with the northern half of the bomb 
range. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're telling them: 'You picked maybe one of the single worst places to do 
this,' " said Jerry M. Conley, the Fish and Game Board commissioner. "We're 
telling them: 'Why don't you look at someplace else? . . . Why can't there be 
another place?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Healy was recently on assignment in Idaho. Target Sighted 
</P>
<P>
 The state of Idaho wants to devote 13,000 acres of wilderness to a new bombing 
range for Mountain Home Air Force Base.

CAPITAL ON EDGE OVER MARKET'S ERRATIC PULSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES RISEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 All eyes in the capital will be on Wall Street this morning as Clinton 
Administration officials and policy-makers at the Federal Reserve Board watch 
to see if the stock market's bloody retreat last week will continue in the face 
of rising interest rates and concerns about a resurgence of inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 From President Clinton on down, the Administration's line has been that stock 
market volatility should not be considered a major concern in the face of a 
rapidly improving national economy. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are going to have an appropriate public policy for what we think is 
happening over the long term," National Economic Council Chairman Robert E. 
Rubin said Sunday on ABC-TV's "This Week With David Brinkley." 
</P>
<P>
 "What we are not going to do, because the President won't let us do it, is 
react to the short-term fluctuations" of the stock market, Rubin added. 
</P>
<P>
 The market posted a loss of 139 points over the week's holiday-shortened 
trading, continuing a sharp selloff of more than 300 points that began in 
earnest in early February. The dive has been attributed to a response to the 
Fed's moves to raise interest rates for the first time in five years. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Fed, officials have shown no outward signs of believing that they moved 
too fast or too far to raise rates. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, just-released minutes of a key February policy meeting show that 
Chairman Alan Greenspan and other top officials expected a sharp reaction from 
Wall Street to their actions, especially since Greenspan planned to publicly 
announce the move, a departure from Fed tradition. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the minutes from the Fed's Open Market Committee, which sets 
interest rate policy, "they believed that even a slight move at this time was 
likely to have a particularly strong impact on financial markets," and "the 
market effect might be amplified by a contemplated decision to authorize the 
chairman to announce the policy action. A relatively small move . . . would 
temper speculative developments in financial markets." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the minutes show that the only debate at the central bank has been 
over whether to raise rates even more quickly than it has. During the meeting, 
a minority of the members urged a larger rate increase in order to get the 
action over with quickly and dampen uncertainty in the financial markets about 
future increases. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts noted that the minutes of the meeting indicate that the Fed was 
counting on its interest rate increase to deflate an overheated stock market. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the Fed's action, many analysts both inside and outside the central 
bank were arguing that the stock market was badly overpriced, partly because of 
the deluge of money into the market from mutual fund investors. Fearing an 
increase in speculation, Fed officials decided to move to pop Wall Street's 
bubble. 
</P>
<P>
 So on Feb. 4, the Fed raised its benchmark federal funds rate by a quarter of 
a percentage point and then followed that with one more quarter-point increase 
in March. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no evidence that the Fed was concerned about the impact of its rate 
hikes on regions, such as California, that have not yet fully emerged from the 
recession. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the minutes of the February meeting show that the policy-makers noted 
that "a range of indicators suggested that the California economy might be 
stabilizing, albeit at a depressed level, after an extended period of declining 
activity." 
</P>
<P>
 The officials also observed that "rebuilding activity following the earthquake 
in California would stimulate engineering and construction in the Los Angeles 
area over the quarters ahead." 
</P>
<P>
 Although long-term interest rates have risen by close to one percentage point 
since they approached record lows late last year, they are still far lower than 
they were throughout most of the 1980s, when the stock market roared. And so 
most analysts and investment advisers are urging calm and counseling clients to 
ride out the market's bumpy days. 
</P>
<P>
 Some analysts said they are wondering how the markets will react to last 
Friday's employment report, which offered more evidence that the national 
recovery is gathering momentum. 
</P>
<P>
 The stock market was closed when the report came out, but interest rates 
surged throughout the day in the bond market. 
</P>
<P>
 In the confusing world of the financial markets, good economic news is often 
bad news for Wall Street, where traders fear that fast growth will bring rising 
inflation, which erodes the values of stocks and bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 But many observers say they believe that the market has overreacted to both 
the Fed's actions and the threat of inflation. They note that consumer prices 
remain relatively stable and that the central bank has only raised its federal 
funds interest rate by half a percentage point. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no inflation out there in the real world," said Irwin Kellner, chief 
economist of Chemical Bank of New York, who also appeared on the ABC program.

COLUMN ONE; NO LONGER LOOKING HOMEWARD; NEARLY 20 YEARS AFTER THE FALL OF 
SAIGON, A GENERATION OF IMMIGRANTS IS COMING OF AGE. THEIR DESIRE TO BUILD A 
GOOD LIFE IN AMERICA OFTEN OVERSHADOWS THE ANGER AND PAIN THEIR PARENTS BROUGHT 
FROM VIETNAM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Trouble seeped into Huy Tran's tranquil childhood in Vietnam like blood on 
sand. Coming home after a day of chasing crickets, he would overhear his 
parents whisper urgently in the hallway. Dispatches from the war front would 
flash across the TV at the town church. Then came the jailings of his father, a 
teacher, by the Communist regime. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, when he was 12, Tran and his father pushed off to sea, and a new life 
in America. The boat trip was some kind of hell, he says. During the trek, a 
woman crazed by dehydration tried to kill herself with her fingernails. Tran 
finally made it to California, but it was six years before he saw his mother 
and siblings again. 
</P>
<P>
 Tran, 22, will never forget his family's ordeal, yet he favors America's 
recent restoration of trade with the government that tormented them. He 
believes that doing business with Vietnam will be good for refugees in the 
United States and those struggling in his homeland. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm still sorry our lives were disrupted by the Vietnam War. But you cannot 
compare my anguish or anger toward the Vietnam War to my parents'," said Tran, 
a computer consultant in Irvine. "They expect me to feel the same, but they 
also understand that, because of my age, I might not be able to remember the 
persecution they had to go through, and the corruption, the hardship the South 
had to endure once the North took over." 
</P>
<P>
 Vietnam-born but American-bred, Tran belongs to a generation that seems 
detached from the war that tore apart their birthplace, forced the exodus of 
1.5 million people and left up to 2 million dead. 
</P>
<P>
 Most are under 30, coming of age as the 20th anniversary of the fall of Saigon 
nears next year. By the end of this century, they will make up a great part of 
the Vietnamese-American community's Establishment, from business to political 
leadership. 
</P>
<P>
 Generally, they have not inherited their parents' hatred of Communism or 
qualms about trading with a former enemy. 
</P>
<P>
 American schools do not teach them Vietnamese history. And most immigrant 
parents are so busy working to support their families that there is little time 
to review the past together -- presuming they and their children can still 
speak the same language. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the children, they are trying to be a part of a society that wants to 
forget the Vietnam War. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are totally socialized into American society. I find that because there 
is nothing in the curriculum, even in the UC system, (about) their background, 
they are generally ignorant to the circumstances that brought them to the 
U.S.," said Eric Crystal, coordinator of the Center for Southeast Asia Studies 
at UC Berkeley. 
</P>
<P>
 "For these kids, first of all, their whole lives are not oriented toward what 
happened in South Vietnam. They've never really lived there. And then there's 
something vaguely negative about Vietnam to an American -- it means war, 
soldiers, prostitutes." 
</P>
<P>
 It is hard to find a voice of authority about the Vietnamese-American 
experience, Crystal said, because it has been largely ignored by U.S. 
universities, perhaps because it is a relatively new immigrant experience. 
</P>
<P>
 And those who are just now approaching adulthood, Crystal said, "have been 
studied even less." 
</P>
<P>
 "But the story of this group is that their fundamental preoccupation is with 
the country that they know, not their parents'," Crystal said. 
</P>
<P>
 First-generation immigrants generally retain most of their homeland's customs 
and values. Their children are expected to adopt the culture of their own 
native country. Generational conflicts are predictable. 
</P>
<P>
 Straddling these worlds are young Vietnamese Americans who, like other 
children born in the old country but raised in the new, have been dubbed "the 
1.5 Generation" by academics. 
</P>
<P>
 Born in a country where parental authority goes unquestioned, this in-between 
generation is growing up in a freedom-loving society whose aggressive anthem 
often is "Just Do It." 
</P>
<P>
 They are "really torn between two worlds," said a counselor at Westminster 
High School, home to the nation's largest Vietnamese student population. 
</P>
<P>
 In California, where nearly half of America's Vietnamese refugees live, many 
children of former political prisoners and war veterans say necessity forces 
them to focus not on past horrors but on their future: entering the mainstream 
and seeking decent jobs and the good life for their families. 
</P>
<P>
 "We as the younger generation expect a little bit more out of this country, 
and from ourself," said Helen Nguyen, 21, a UC Irvine biology major who was 
born in Saigon and fled with her family when she was 7. 
</P>
<P>
 Her father was a soldier in the Vietnam War and was a prisoner for a year in 
the brainwashing "re-education" camps of the Communist North Vietnamese, Nguyen 
said. After a year of processing at a Malaysian camp, her family made its way 
to Ventura, where her parents live. This painful family history, she added, is 
seldom discussed at home. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first level (of immigrants), where our parents came in, were just 
grateful (to be here)," she said. "I can see how the younger people are just 
struggling to work and have a solid career. I think if you give the Generation 
1.5 more time, after they've established careers and families, then they later 
will come around to activism." 
</P>
<P>
 For now, though, such interest seems secondary. "My parents don't speak much 
about the war. My dad did serve a year in a re-education camp; he took it as 
natural. (In the war), men fought, we suffered, it is past now and we move on." 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the generational conflict is both universal and unique," said Yong 
Chen, a UC Irvine Asian American studies professor specializing in U.S. 
immigration history. "If you look to earlier immigrants from Europe, you will 
find a similar generational conflict." 
</P>
<P>
 More recently, new appreciation of ethnic differences and cultural diversity 
have reversed past patterns of abandoning heritage for the mainstream, Chen 
said. Those of the 1.5 Generation can select what they deem the best of past 
and present cultures. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Duong Cao Pham has a front-row seat to the 1.5 Generation. He is a 
visiting professor of Vietnamese history and culture at UC Irvine and UCLA and 
teaches high school full time. His four children were born in Vietnam. The 
eldest was 8 when the family fled just before Saigon fell in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
 The Vietnamese only began immigrating en masse 19 years ago, he said. For 
these immigrants, technology -- including radio, television and faxes -- has 
built unprecedented bridges between the old and new worlds. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's easier to maintain ties and knowledge about what's going on in each 
country," Pham said. "We are now in another age, compared to the Chinese in the 
19th Century or the Filipinos after World War II, or the Koreans in the 1960s." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the technology, Pham's 21-year-old son, Vu Pham, sees greater 
differences between the generations. 
</P>
<P>
 Moving from Saigon to the United States when he was 3, Vu grew up in Fountain 
Valley and is a graduate student in UC Irvine's humanities honors program. He 
is writing his senior thesis on members of the 1.5 Generation -- particularly 
their lack of community involvement compared to their parents. 
</P>
<P>
 "In my research, I've found that there are very, very few people in the 1.5 
Generation who are community activists," Vu said. "Many are concentrating only 
on mainstreaming." 
</P>
<P>
 In his interviews, Vu said he found that his peers are emotionally and 
intellectually removed from such issues as restored trade ties because they 
have only considered the financial benefits and not the political reality. If 
many Americans seemed resigned about renewed ties with a former enemy, he 
noted, why wouldn't Vietnamese Americans be as well? 
</P>
<P>
 "More personal is that there is this alienation from Vietnam, aside from faint 
memories," Vu Pham said. "A lot of the 1.5 . . . don't plan to return to 
Vietnam, they don't have any relatives in Vietnam, or if they do, they are 
usually relatives of their parents." 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, he said, there is the handicap of ignorance. "One of the major 
reasons you don't deal with issues about Vietnam at my age is that it's not 
taught in school. I had nothing taught to me in high school about the Vietnam 
War. We reached the late 20th Century, and it wasn't ever mentioned." 
</P>
<P>
 To help fellow refugees, Vietnamese student organizations have formed at 
numerous Southern California colleges. One is Project Ngoc (pearl), which was 
organized in 1989 to help a new wave of refugees and asylum seekers. 
</P>
<P>
 The groups are less political than service and social and cultural clubs such 
as the Vietnamese Student Assn., which has chapters throughout the Southland, 
and the Vietnamese-American Coalition, formed by four UC Irvine students, 
including Tran. 
</P>
<P>
 Out of respect, Vietnamese American students often preface their own horror 
stories by stressing that others have suffered much more when their country was 
ruined by war. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was very hard for me, the first few years without my Mom," Tran said. I've 
known families that didn't reunite for 10 or 12 years later." 
</P>
<P>
 From Vietnam, he and his father traveled to Indonesia, Texas and finally to 
Los Angeles, where they were later reunited with Tran's mother and brothers. He 
graduated from John Marshall High School in Los Angeles, and enrolled as a 
biology major at UC Irvine. After one quarter he switched to political science. 
His parents virulently opposed the move, believing hard sciences to be a 
better-paying field and less discriminating against the foreign-born. 
</P>
<P>
 Tran had to pay his own tuition, although he was allowed to live at home. He 
has never regretted the decision, but he has not found work in social services 
and remains a full-time computer consultant. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite all the torment, he said, coming to America "has meant I have a better 
life than I would have had, a better education." 
</P>
<P>
 At La Quinta High School in Westminster, about 60% of the 1,283 students are 
Vietnamese, the highest percentage in the country. Last year's homecoming court 
was Vietnamese, as was this year's queen. And all but one of the candidates for 
La Quinta's highest honor -- Aztec boy and girl student of the year -- are 
Vietnamese, too. 
</P>
<P>
 The Vietnamese Club, with 200 members, is the biggest on campus. But all 
meetings are in English, and it is a service group that does not focus on 
culture or ethnicity. Co-President Lynn Phu is Cambodian but was born after her 
family fled to Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a sign, some experts say, of the cultural crossroads that define 
Generation 1.5-ers. 
</P>
<P>
 In the days after President Clinton announced the renewal of trade ties with 
Vietnam, Rita Corpin's World History honors class discussed what it all meant. 
A 20-year-old bumper sticker on Corpin's lectern read "MIAs -- Only Hanoi 
Knows." The class was celebrating the arrival of the Tet New Year. Of the 36 
students, 12 were born in Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 A show of hands revealed that the students were in agreement: They thought 
lifting the embargo was good. Why? Because it would make it easier to fly into 
Ho Chi Minh City, formerly Saigon. 
</P>
<P>
 Nobody mentioned the war, boat people, or concerns about doing business with a 
former enemy. Nobody mentioned prisoners of war. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will be better for two-way travel and to visit relatives now," said one 
student, although he added that his family had already done this. "It will be 
easier for us to send money there," another said. 
</P>
<P>
 At La Quinta, it is not just dating and curfew and report card hassles that 
Vietnamese-born children bring to school with them each day. There are 27 
English as a second language classes taught here, and the school common is 
visibly divided between Americanized Vietnamese and the newcomers, who speak 
their native language and squat Asian-style through lunch. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a girl commit suicide the month before I came here," said Principal 
Mitch Thomas, "and it was over one thing: assimilation. . . . She was a bright, 
beautiful, capable kid. And those kids -- who say what are you talking about, 
what embargo? -- they are interested in the here and now. Their parents know 
all the politics, but the kids, all of their energy is striving for 
assimilation." 
</P>
<P>
 One thing about kids is universal, say Thomas and other educators working with 
Vietnamese students. No matter what their nationality, they all want to fit in. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior Thanh Tang, 17, vice president of the student body and honor roll 
student, is something of an exception. He is among the students who seem to 
hold an educated opinion about the reopening of trade: He opposes it -- 
perhaps, he says, more strongly than his parents do. 
</P>
<P>
 In Vietnam, his parents imported produce -- mostly grapes and oranges. Before 
that, his father was a police officer. Here, they rise at 5 and work seven days 
a week at their Santa Ana restaurant. They lost so much to come here, he said, 
and Americans will lose plenty now, too. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think with the embargo gone we'll be losing more of the workers. Soon we'll 
see Sony in Vietnam; the labor is cheaper. And the environmental concerns . . . 
people building factories without standards and destroying the rain forest 
there. 
</P>
<P>
 "Someone's killing your people (prisoners of war and soldiers listed as 
missing in action), and you're opening trade with them?," he said, his face 
turning incredulous. 
</P>
<P>
 Of those like him, born in Vietnam but raised here, he said: "Some people are 
too young to see or feel any of that: Why did you lift the embargo on people 
who hurt my parents and made me go through that?" 
</P>
<P>
 "When I first came here, my parents talked about Communists! Communists! But 
they don't talk about it anymore," said Tang, who works weekends at the 
restaurant and has dreams of attending Harvard's business school. "When I have 
time to sit down and talk, it's not about Vietnam; it's more (about) what I'm 
doing after high school, where I'm going to school. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think parents don't tell them about it," Tang added. Like his family and 
those of his friends, "everybody is too busy trying to work to support their 
family."

ISRAELI POLICE CAPTURE FUGITIVE KACH LEADER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK FINEMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Israeli police Sunday arrested the fugitive leader of the outlawed Jewish 
group Kach, ending a monthlong manhunt aimed at neutralizing the threat of 
extremist Jewish settlers and at blunting Palestinian outrage after last 
month's massacre in a Hebron mosque. 
</P>
<P>
 But within hours of the arrest of Baruch Marzel, who heads the movement that 
spawned the Jewish settler who gunned down about 30 Palestinian worshipers Feb. 
25, a settler leader warned that another massacre is possible if the government 
continues to make concessions to the Palestinians in the occupied territories. 
</P>
<P>
 "An atmosphere like this is what could push Jews to desperate and unconsidered 
acts," declared Zvi Katzover, mayor of the Kiryat Arba settlement near Hebron 
in the West Bank that was home to Baruch Goldstein, a Brooklyn-born physician 
who fired more than 100 bullets at praying Palestinians inside the Cave of the 
Patriarchs. 
</P>
<P>
 Testifying before the Israeli panel investigating the massacre, which Prime 
Minister Yitzhak Rabin has blamed on a lone "lunatic," Katzover said, "I do not 
deny that there are crazies and lunatics in Kiryat Arba and the area." 
</P>
<P>
 In related developments:  
</P>
<P>
 * Delegations from Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization reconvened 
Sunday in Cairo to push for a speedy agreement on Palestinian autonomy in the 
Gaza Strip and the West Bank town of Jericho before an April 13 deadline. 
Negotiators for both sides expressed optimism that agreement could be reached 
before the deadline. 
</P>
<P>
 * Rabin said in remarks broadcast Sunday that Israel will let exiled 
Palestinians return and will negotiate a prisoner release at the Cairo talks 
this week. Palestinians said 49 exiles will return, the Reuters news service 
reported. The PLO is demanding the release of an estimated 9,000 prisoners held 
by Israel. Rabin did not give a figure, but the Israeli newspaper Davar said 
several thousand will be freed in the coming weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 * Ten Palestinians and two Israeli soldiers were wounded in clashes in Hebron 
and Gaza on Sunday, Reuters reported. 
</P>
<P>
 In a pre-dawn raid Sunday, a police counterterrorism unit captured Kach leader 
Marzel inside a Jewish settlement near Kiryat Arba. Police traced him to the 
house of a fellow settler. 
</P>
<P>
 Marzel, 35, was unarmed, and he offered no resistance, according to police 
spokesman Eric Ben-Chen. Marzel, whose movement acknowledged that Goldstein was 
a member and proclaimed him a martyr after the massacre, had evaded the police 
-- but not the media -- during the weeks since the government ordered his 
detention. 
</P>
<P>
 During the month that Marzel appeared to move freely, granting newspaper and 
television interviews and appearing at pro-settler rallies near Hebron, many 
Palestinians were growing increasingly skeptical about the manhunt for the man 
who succeeded the late Rabbi Meir Kahane, who founded Kach in Brooklyn in 1971 
and was assassinated there 20 years later. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said Marzel will be held without trial for three months along with the 
six other Jewish extremist leaders who were targeted for arrest by Rabin's 
government under an anti-terrorism law that has been applied mostly to 
Palestinian radicals in the past. 
</P>
<P>
 Marzel was captured at the home of a settler who was arrested a year ago and 
is in jail and under trial for murder. Yoram Skolnik is charged with last 
year's fatal shooting of a handcuffed Palestinian, who was in police custody 
for stabbing a Jew. 
</P>
<P>
 Skolnik's father, interviewed on Israel Radio at his home in Jerusalem after 
Marzel's arrest, said his son's house was vacant and unlocked when Marzel 
entered. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no problem to get into the house. . . . Obviously, somebody knew 
that the house would be empty," Fred Skolnik said, insisting that his son had 
nothing to do with Kach. 
</P>
<P>
 Marzel's arrest came amid other attempts Sunday to ease tension and speed the 
peace process between Israel and the PLO. 
</P>
<P>
 The Israeli and PLO delegations reconvened in Cairo hoping to beat the April 
13 deadline -- the date set last September for the end of Israel's military 
withdrawal from the Gaza Strip and Jericho. 
</P>
<P>
 Israel has yet to begin withdrawing its troops, a process that was to start 
Dec. 13 under the September Israeli-PLO peace declaration. But a key member of 
Israel's negotiating team, Environment Minister Yossi Sarid, said Sunday that 
he believes the two sides will agree before April 13 and that the troops could 
be out within a few days of a final agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 Israel's chief delegate to the talks this week, Maj. Gen. Uzi Dayan, head of 
the Israeli army's planning department, said initial discussions were also 
focusing on the early deployment of Palestinian police in the occupied 
territories. 
</P>
<P>
 Up to eight high-ranking Palestinian officers are scheduled to arrive in Gaza 
in the next few days to prepare for the initial deployment of several hundred 
Palestinian police, now trained and awaiting dispatch from Egypt and Jordan, 
beginning Thursday, PLO officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Chief Palestinian negotiator Nabil Shaath shared Sarid's optimism that they 
will meet the April 13 target date. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will do our best. This is an important date," Shaath said. "We can do it 
if there are no major crimes against the Palestinians, and if there is the 
political will to do it on the part of the Israelis." 
</P>
<P>
 But it was just such major crimes that Kiryat Arba's Katzover predicted could 
well take place as he testified Sunday before the Shamgar Commission, the 
judicial body headed by Israeli Chief Supreme Court Justice Meir Shamgar. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission has already cast doubt on the official version of the massacre 
in its mission to determine how Goldstein fired three full magazine clips at 
Palestinian worshipers at the mosque. 
</P>
<P>
 Calling such massacres "acts of desperation," Katzover, who publicly denounced 
Goldstein and the massacre, told the panel that Israeli concessions to the PLO, 
such as last week's agreement to permit an armed international force to monitor 
Palestinian security in Hebron, sent signals to the city's more than 100,000 
Arabs that "Jewish blood has been abandoned."

O.C. SEN. HURTT PRESSES ON TOWARD CONSERVATIVE GOALS; POLITICS: BRASH 
REPUBLICAN MAKES IT HIS BUSINESS TO PUT MORE LIKE-MINDED CANDIDATES IN THE 
LEGISLATURE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC BAILEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 He burst into the staid chambers of the state Senate a year ago, a political 
outsider crashing the most exclusive of clubs. Life in the Capitol hasn't been 
quite the same since. 
</P>
<P>
 Legislative rookies are expected to quietly find their spot on a back bench, 
but Rob Hurtt -- Orange County businessman, conservative Republican, 
evangelical Christian -- would have none of that. Hurtt had just spent $300,000 
to win a state Senate seat. Like any good capitalist, he wanted his money's 
worth. 
</P>
<P>
 The upstart lawmaker, who had never before held elected office, spent his 
first year testing the traditions of the political establishment. He talked 
precociously of becoming Senate Republican leader and griped about his party's 
complacency. Occasionally, Hurtt brashly questioned GOP veterans about floor 
votes he felt were anti-Republican. Democratic leaders quickly labeled him a 
bully. 
</P>
<P>
 But his biggest splash has come with the huge sums of campaign cash Hurtt 
funnels to like-minded candidates. If bloody election-year battles seem a 
throwback to the Jurassic epoch, then Hurtt is the Republican T-Rex. In the 
past two years, the senator has joined with three other Christian businessmen 
to contribute a whopping $3.6 million to conservative candidates and causes. 
</P>
<P>
 Now come the elections of 1994, and for Rob Hurtt the future could be just a 
few precinct victories away. He is the GOP's Senate point man on campaign 
strategy, and arguably the chief architect of the Republican Party's grand 
design to recapture the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
 If all goes according to GOP plans, the party will gain ground in the Assembly 
and Senate during this year's races, then seize power in one or both houses in 
1996. Should that scenario unfold, the junior senator from Orange County could 
probably script whatever political future he wants. 
</P>
<P>
 That is a pretty heady possibility for a lifelong industrialist who, until 
recently, had never tinkered with California's political machinery. Before 
campaigns, Hurtt was into cans, building a fortune with his Garden Grove 
company that manufactures decorative tins and plastic containers. By most 
accounts, the hard-driving new senator has nimbly switched hats from 
businessman to politician, using money and unbridled gumption to acquire a 
position of influence that many lawmakers never achieve. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Rob is the best thing that has happened to the Republican Party in 
many, many years," said state Sen. John Lewis (R-Orange), a conservative ally 
from Orange County. "For years we've been outmanned and outspent by the 
Democrats. Rob is the great equalizer." 'Religious Oligarchy' 
</P>
<P>
 While many conservatives look to the 49-year-old senator as a political 
messiah, Democrats are alternately bemused and bewildered, irritated and 
incensed. And worried. 
</P>
<P>
 As they mobilize to defend the Capitol turf they have controlled for decades, 
Democratic leaders point to Hurtt as the prime threat -- and not just because 
of the money he commands. Hurtt may promote himself as a "citizen legislator" 
and champion of business, but Democratic chiefs contend that the public facade 
masks the Bible-based platform of the religious right. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Bill Lockyer (D-Hayward), the Senate leader, suggests that the Republican 
freshman and the Allied Business PAC, the political action committee Hurtt 
formed with Orange County savings-and-loan heir Howard Ahmanson, are bent on 
creating a "religious oligarchy." If conservative Republicans sweep into power, 
an era of New Testament intolerance would follow, Lockyer warns. "Our 
democratic institutions are threatened," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hurtt is weary of the dire rhetoric, saying Democrats are "trying to make me 
into a bogyman." Yes, he believes in traditional two-parent families, is 
staunchly anti-abortion, opposes special rights for gays and supports 
conservative goals such as school vouchers.  
</P>
<P>
 He insists, however, that he has no desire to see California become a 
religious theocracy. For now he is content to vote against taxes, sponsor 
legislation to fight unions and work to slash regulations hampering industry. 
The conservative social issues are important, Hurtt concedes, but they can wait 
until California's recession-racked economy rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 In any case, Hurtt assures doubters, "there's no reason for alarm. Our agenda 
is pretty much America and apple pie." 
</P>
<P>
 The man himself, friends say, is hardly puritanical. He drinks in social 
settings and laments that he has taken up smoking again after more than a dozen 
years of abstinence (he vows to quit). To pass evenings away from home, Hurtt 
often invites Republican allies over for low-stakes poker in his suite at the 
Capitol Hyatt Regency. And while many of his legislative cohorts tool around 
town in tax-subsidized Buicks and Lincolns, Hurtt pilots a sports car he bought 
with his own cash. 
</P>
<P>
 Conservative colleagues say he is glib and quick-witted, principled and 
competitive, a hard charger and a fast learner. 
</P>
<P>
 Not everyone is so kind. Some moderate Republicans contend that Hurtt is a 
politician with an attitude, flaunting an imperious nature developed during 
years as a boss in the business world. They also grumble about his freshman 
mistakes and occasional cantankerous confrontations. Groused one veteran 
lawmaker: "He can tell you off with a smile on his face." Prospering Business 
</P>
<P>
 But get Hurtt talking about his boyhood and he can be downright charming. A 
product of Pasadena public schools, the 5-foot-8 senator tells of getting 
knocked unconscious in a high school football game and wobbling to the 
sidelines. "The coach spun me around and said, 'No, son, the other sideline.' " 
Hurtt also played tennis with future Wimbledon champ Stan Smith. "He was two 
years younger than I was," Hurtt recalled. "Whipped his butt." 
</P>
<P>
 After college, Hurtt went to work for his dad's can manufacturing firm, 
Container Supply Co. The firm prospered, with sales of $23 million in 1990. 
Underlying that success is his father's simple philosophy: Don't operate on 
borrowed money. It's a law Hurtt wishes the deficit-spending state of 
California would follow. 
</P>
<P>
 The impetus for Hurtt's political mission can be found in part at his Garden 
Grove factory, a bustling maze of assembly lines and punch presses. That sound 
and fury of free enterprise has drawn the scrutiny of regulatory agencies, 
notably the South Coast Air Quality Management District. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is what the AQMD hates, this great big ugly thing," Hurtt said one 
recent afternoon, waving a hand at a huge oven that bakes ink labels onto 
aluminum cans -- and produces the building blocks of smog. Hurtt has been 
battling the AQMD for years over how much the oven can be used, a spat that has 
put a crimp in his business. 
</P>
<P>
 Hurtt was also prodded toward politics by watching his four children grow up 
in a world much changed from that of his youth. The watershed came when he 
talked with a high school counselor about his eldest son's mediocre grades. The 
counselor told Hurtt not to worry. His boy was a good kid, never got into 
trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 "A light bulb went on," Hurtt recalls. "They didn't care if he wasn't learning 
anything. As long as he wasn't causing problems, they thought he was great." 
</P>
<P>
 The spiritual element played a role in his political conversion. Hurtt began 
attending a men's Bible study group in the mid-1980s and joined an evangelical 
church in Santa Ana. He also drew inspiration from the work of James Dobson, 
whose evangelical operation in Colorado Springs, Colo., produces books, tapes, 
videos and the nationwide radio program "Focus on the Family." In addition, 
Hurtt became a booster of the Family Research Council, a conservative 
Washington think-tank run by Gary Bauer, a former Reagan Administration 
domestic policy adviser. 
</P>
<P>
 In the late 1980s, Hurtt decided to put his money where his convictions were. 
He founded Capitol Resource Institute, a conservative Sacramento group that 
specializes in family issues. But the businessman quickly learned the limits of 
lobbying for conservative causes in the Democrat-dominated state Capitol. Hurtt 
turned to trying to remake the Legislature in a conservative image. 
</P>
<P>
 He began in 1990 by donating modestly to a few Orange County candidates. But 
the campaign contributions skyrocketed with the creation of Allied Business PAC 
before the 1992 elections. Hurtt and his three cohorts quickly became a force, 
helping elect 12 of the more than two dozen conservatives they supported that 
year. Cruising to Victory 
</P>
<P>
 Hurtt took the plunge himself when a central Orange County Senate seat was 
vacated, saying he feared a Democrat might swoop down and defeat a weak field 
of GOP contenders. He cruised to victory in March, 1993, with 76% of the vote. 
</P>
<P>
 He arrived in the state Capitol and immediately made waves. A newspaper quoted 
Hurtt as saying he had come to Sacramento to keep an eye on the candidates 
Allied helped elect. Later he offended backers of a bill to raise cigarette 
levies to fund breast-cancer research by suggesting it was part of a "stream of 
ticky-tack" demands for higher taxes. In another episode, senators blanched 
after he voted in committee for a jail construction bond, then joked loudly to 
a prison guards lobbyist to remember it when Hurtt came calling for a campaign 
contribution. 
</P>
<P>
 If his freshman year was spent rubbing some politicos the wrong way, Hurtt has 
smoothed a few rough edges for 1994. "I'm not going to be a basher," he said, 
"but I'm not going to be afraid to talk. I think I'm asking the things the 
common constituent wants to know." 
</P>
<P>
 Some colleagues, however, contend that Hurtt's first-year difficulties went 
beyond snippy rhetoric. They say he failed miserably to heed advice from 
legislative graybeards, as if oblivious to the Capitol's cardinal rules: 
Experience and knowledge count, and political friendships are based almost as 
much upon personality as on ideology and money. 
</P>
<P>
 Those facts smacked Hurtt in the face after he made noises about challenging 
Sen. Ken Maddy (R-Fresno) for Senate GOP leader. Despite his campaign clout, 
Hurtt fell far short of the support he needed when the leadership fight came to 
a head last fall. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was quite honest with him and told Rob he needs to pay his dues," said Sen. 
Cathie Wright (R-Simi Valley). "Being leader doesn't just mean you get 
Republicans elected." 
</P>
<P>
 Hurtt still earned a plum. In a conciliatory gesture, Maddy named him chairman 
of the Senate's new elections committee. Some see it as a shrewd tactical ploy 
by Maddy -- the leader can take credit for election victories, but blame Hurtt 
if the GOP stumbles this year. 
</P>
<P>
 On the legislative front, Hurtt has proven willing to buck the status quo. He 
broke from tradition and was the only lawmaker from either party who didn't 
support Lockyer's nomination in January for president pro tem of the Senate. In 
early March, Hurtt was one of only three Senate Republicans to join in 
overriding the governor's veto of a Democratic illegal immigration bill. 
Democrats Need Him 
</P>
<P>
 Despite his impressive victory last year, Hurtt is hardly a household name in 
his own district. Democrats, citing their own polling data, say he could be 
vulnerable in this year's election. Hurtt concedes it won't be a cakewalk, but 
remains confident of returning to Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 In some ways the Democrats need Hurtt. That fact was vividly illustrated a few 
weeks ago when all 40 senators gathered for an annual photograph. Sen. Tom 
Hayden, the liberal from Santa Monica best known for his Vietnam-era activism 
and marriage to actress Jane Fonda, arrived late. Finding his spot, Hayden 
paused to shake hands with Hurtt. 
</P>
<P>
 "Photo opportunity!" one of the senators quipped. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, but which one will it hurt more?" remarked another, prompting laughter. 
</P>
<P>
 It may have been a joke, but therein lies a political truth: Rob Hurtt has 
become the poster boy for the Democratic fund-raising machine. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as Republicans for years blackballed competitors by linking them to 
Hayden, now the Democratic Party is turning the tables by using Hurtt. Never 
mind if perception might be eclipsing reality. For Democratic candidates eager 
to stay in power, Hurtt is being portrayed as the champion of religious 
judgmental ideas. 
</P>

 When visiting potential donors, Lockyer totes charts warning of a "theocratic" 
threat posed by Hurtt and his moneyed allies. The pitch is well received. 
"Voters," Lockyer said, "don't want to be governed by extremists." 
</P>
<P>
 Hurtt says Lockyer and other critics have it all wrong. Given his way, Hurtt 
wouldn't force-feed religion, he maintains. Rather, he has a vision of society 
flipping back the calendar.

COW COUNTY TELLS U.S. TO BACK OFF; LAND USE: A SLICE OF THE OLD WEST DECLARES 
JOINT SOVEREIGNTY OVER GOVERNMENT LANDS AND THREATENS TO ARREST FEDERAL 
OFFICIALS. A COALITION OF COWBOYS, MERCHANTS AND EX-EARTH FIRSTERS IS BEHIND 
THE REVOLT. 
</P>

<P>
 This has always been a hospitable place to troublemakers. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the last staging ground for Apache raids across the Southwest. Billy 
the Kid lived here for a few years. Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid worked 
briefly as peace officers. Dave Foreman, the rebel environmentalist, took up 
residence in the 1970s during the early years of the Earth First! movement he 
helped found. 
</P>
<P>
 Although it is quieter here now, Catron County has not lost its flair for Old 
West theatrics or its penchant for thumbing its nose at authority. 
</P>
<P>
 Backed by an eccentric coalition of cowboys, merchants, ex-Earth Firsters and 
aging hippies with flowing beards and names like Uncle River and Lone Wolf 
Circles, Catron County has sparked a populist uprising that has spread to most 
western states. It pits the agrarian traditions of cow towns and logging camps 
against the modern muscle of federal regulatory agencies and their allies in 
the environmental movement. 
</P>
<P>
 Following Catron's lead, about 300 counties in the West are laying claims to 
joint sovereignty over federal lands lying within their boundaries. The 
movement reflects mounting concern that the government's efforts to protect 
wilderness are costing local people their jobs and pushing small towns down the 
road to extinction. 
</P>
<P>
 The movement began three years ago when the Catron County Commission passed an 
ordinance calling for the arrest of any federal agent who violated the civil 
rights of residents. It was a bold thrust for a place defended by just six law 
enforcement officers.  
</P>
<P>
 It was so controversial that the Forest Service threatened to summon federal 
marshals, and the sheriff at the time said he would not enforce it. But he lost 
the next election and his successor, Bob Wellborn, an imposing man known 
hereabouts as Scarface, took a different approach. "With a warrant issued by a 
judge I would arrest anyone," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Claiming a historic "civil right" to work the land in Catron County, and 
backing it up with language from treaties and land grants dating to the 16th 
Century, officials declared that they no longer would take orders from the 
federal government on matters of "local custom and culture" -- in other words, 
logging, mining and ranching. 
</P>
<P>
 "Catron County did what a lot of rural counties have been wanting to do for a 
long time. It said 'enough,' " said Frank Falen, a member of a Cheyenne, Wyo., 
law firm that is providing legal guidance to the county home rule movement. 
</P>
<P>
 Catron County is mostly outback -- a labyrinth of narrow, twisting canyons, 
spiny ridges and desert mountain ranges that cover an area nearly the size of 
Massachusetts. With a population of less than 3,000, a handful of tiny towns 
with no hospitals and not a single street light, it might seem an unlikely 
place to foment a political revolt. 
</P>
<P>
 Not if you know the inhabitants. Settled by Confederate veterans and 
Copperheads -- Southern sympathizers from Northern states who fled persecution 
after the Civil War -- Catron County has always been a refuge for people who 
resent outside interference. 
</P>
<P>
 "People still move out there because they think they are coming to the end of 
the map where they can hole up and do what they want," said Peter Russell, a 
planner who lives in Silver City just south of Catron County. 
</P>
<P>
 As in many western counties, livelihoods here are tied to land belonging to 
the federal government. People eke out a living running small herds of cattle, 
working in sawmills or chipping away at silver deposits in the Mogollon 
Mountains. Weekly earnings average less than $250. 
</P>
<P>
 When the government began carving out sanctuaries for the Mexican spotted owl 
and a half-dozen other threatened species, jobs were affected. A sawmill 
employing 75 people shut down and century-old wilderness grazing rights were in 
jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
 There have been no confrontations with federal authorities since Catron County 
issued its arrest threat, but local officials say the saber rattling had the 
desired effect. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have successfully asserted our right to equal partnership in land-use 
decisions," said Jim Catron, the county's attorney and a descendant of Thomas 
Catron, an early U.S. senator from New Mexico for whom the county is named. 
</P>
<P>
 County officials have obtained a pledge from the U.S. Forest Service to 
consult with them on all land-use decisions. Even though there is nothing on 
paper to suggest that the federal government will abide by the county's 
recommendations, Forest Service officials are doing a good job of sounding 
compliant. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem we had, we weren't recognizing the county as a governing body to 
the extent we should have," said Carl Pence, acting supervisor of the Gila 
National Forest. 
</P>
<P>
 But Pence said life has not been easy for his people since the county issued 
its ultimatum. "Some of our people did feel intimidated. They thought they 
might be in some danger."  
</P>
<P>
 Others argue that the county avoided bloodshed by taking matters into its own 
hands. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people felt they had been pushed too far. If we hadn't done what we 
did, someone probably would have gotten shot," said Howard Hutchinson, a former 
Earth Firster and a leading proponent of the county sovereignty movement, 
promoting Catron's version of rural civil rights to audiences across the West. 
</P>
<P>
 The county's ordinance bears little resemblance to the civil rights laws of 
the 1960s upholding racial equality. Here, the law has more to do with property 
rights -- specifically, the rights of residents to make a living off the land 
much as they have for a century or more. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, as they defend the sanctity of rural "custom and culture" -- the 
buzzwords of the county movement -- these white men in cowboy hats liken 
themselves to members of an oppressed minority trying to preserve what is left 
of an ancient heritage. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were getting treated like the Indians," said James (Speedy) Shelton, a 
69-year-old cowboy poet whose grandparents came to New Mexico from Kentucky 
after the Civil War. 
</P>
<P>
 In most places where the Catron example has been followed, including several 
counties in Northern California, the language has been watered down. Federal 
agents outside of southwestern New Mexico would not appear to be in danger of 
arrest. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Catron's gospel of custom and culture enjoys wide adherence, with 
most counties claiming a constitutional right to take part in any federal land 
planning affecting the livelihoods of residents. 
</P>
<P>
 In California, sponsors of a Butte County joint powers resolution said the 
county was able to head off a proposed ban on recreation and fishing by having 
a place at the bargaining table. The ban had been proposed as part of a federal 
wild and scenic rivers designation for a local stream. A spokesman for the 
resolution also said the county was able to win postponement of a plan to place 
32 endangered species of grass off limits to cattle grazing. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite its early successes, the county movement has been ridiculed as 
modern-day "know nothingism" by hard-line environmentalists and dismissed by 
legal scholars. Foreman has taken to referring to his old stomping grounds as 
"cartoon county." In the only legal test so far, a clone of the New Mexico 
ordinance was shot down by a federal judge in Idaho, who ruled that it violated 
the supremacy clause of the Constitution, which grants sovereignty to the 
federal government. 
</P>
<P>
 However, some environmentalists argue against trivializing the county 
movement, saying it reflects the anxiety of people who have been watching the 
steady decline of rural communities since World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a bona fide, grass-roots citizens movement," said Donald Snow, director 
of the Northern Lights Institute, a Montana-based nonprofit group that promotes 
environmental causes. "All over the West there is a constituency that 
represents hardscrabble livelihood, not corporate profit." 
</P>
<P>
 Snow also believes that environmentalists and their rural adversaries have 
more in common than they think, including a desire to preserve the West's 
natural resources. He urges both sides "to get down out of the cockpits of 
their fighter planes and start talking to one another." 
</P>
<P>
 There is no sign of that happening soon in Catron County. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, sponsors of the ordinance began attacking a local environmental 
group as "pagan nature worshipers" in a series of radio ads. 
</P>
<P>
 The environmentalists claim that the ads provoked a string of evictions, tire 
slashings and barroom sluggings that prompted them to leave the county. But 
after retreating to Silver City, they mounted a counteroffensive aimed at 
purging cows from the Gila Wilderness. 
</P>
<P>
 Located mainly in Catron County, the Gila became the nation's first official 
wilderness preserve in 1924. Today, this landscape of silvery streams, gnarled 
cottonwoods and magenta-tipped canyon walls is a fragile terrain that bleeds 
easily and often. Old-timers blame the perennial destruction of streamside 
vegetation on a recurring cycle of drought and flood. Environmentalists point 
to the year-round pounding of cattle hoofs. 
</P>
<P>
 But there is more to custom and culture in the rural West than cattle 
ranching. 
</P>
<P>
 In Catron County, there is Ed Bashista, a self-described screwball inventor 
who moved his family and 60 tons of automotive testing equipment from suburban 
Los Angeles 10 years ago to a juniper-studded hilltop in Catron County. 
Bashista speaks darkly of prying bureaucrats and corporate pirates who 
interfered with his work in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, generating his own power and operating out of a cluster of military 
surplus trailers, Bashista said he is free to pursue his dream of designing the 
world's cleanest, most fuel-efficient combustion engine. 
</P>
<P>
 Down the road in Glenwood, a wide spot along U.S. 180, Wendy Peralta, whose 
family has been here for four generations, still spars with bureaucrats as she 
tries to sustain her tiny community. 
</P>
<P>
 State officials, she said, are threatening to shut down the two-room 
schoolhouse for a lack of students. Meanwhile, Peralta is searching for someone 
to take her place as the volunteer ambulance driver. 
</P>
<P>
 "It gets to you after a while, sitting next to dying friends and neighbors all 
the way to Silver (City), knowing you probably won't make it in time," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Also on Peralta's mind is her tussle with an oil company over its demand for 
removal of the elk head that has graced her family's gas station for 50 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "They don't care if your help is rude, naked or red in the face as long as the 
place looks exactly like every other gas station in the country," Peralta said. 
</P>
<P>
 From Peralta's moldering elk horns to the nearby ghost town of Mogollon, the 
past in Catron County is hard to ignore. For environmentalists who focus on the 
piles of cyanide-slaked mine tailings and on the dusty, cow-clogged creek 
bottoms, the scene is more retrograde than romantic. 
</P>
<P>
 The past also echoes in the political movement that got started here. It is 
reminiscent of rural America's most famous lost cause, the 1890s Populist 
campaign against the gold standard and 20th-Century capitalism. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite all its troubles, those in Catron County make an argument for keeping 
things the way they are. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you come here, you don't have to worry about how much money you have, or 
what you've done in your past life," Peralta said. "People assume you'll pull 
your weight. The welcome mat is out. Around here, people leave their keys in 
their truck in case a neighbor needs to borrow it. It's not such a bad place." 
Drawing the Line 
</P>
<P>
 Residents of Catron County in New Mexico have sparked a populist uprising by 
laying claim to joint sovereignty over federal lands that lie within their 
bounderies.

CLASS SPLIT BY UPROAR OVER READING ASSIGNMENT; EDUCATION: SOME VENTURA COUNTY 
PARENTS COMPLAIN ABOUT THE CONTENT OF RICHARD WRIGHT'S 'BLACK BOY.' OTHERS 
DEFEND IT AS A VALUABLE LESSON IN BIGOTRY AND DEPRIVATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Nearly half a century after it was published, Richard Wright's searing account 
of growing up poor and black in the segregated South has split a Ventura County 
high school honors class into two groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents objecting to what they say are amoral and violent messages in "Black 
Boy" have insisted that their ninth- and 10th-grade children be given an 
alternate text. Out of 68 students in the two Fillmore High School English 
class sections, 11 now spend the class period in the library, reading a novel 
about Eastern European immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 These parents raised such a furor that the district has called a special 
parent-faculty conference today to discuss the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "The title seemed fairly aggressive to me," said Brian Botstone, who became 
concerned when his son mentioned the assignment last month. 
</P>
<P>
 Flipping through the text only confirmed Botstone's fears. "I know it's 
reality, but being reality doesn't make it worthwhile," he said. "This is not 
conducive to teaching people what civilized people are supposed to behave 
like."  
</P>
<P>
 Many other parents, however, defend Wright's autobiography as a valuable 
lesson in bigotry and deprivation. 
</P>
<P>
 "This community is very, very prejudiced and there are lots of (religious) 
fundamentalists who feel it would be great if we could put blinders over our 
kids," said Ruth Prado, whose son is in the class. "But I think it's important 
for my son to know what life is all about." 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the students reading "Black Boy" say it is the best work they have 
read all year. "The book made me think about what's really out there," said 
Mark Prado, 15, Ruth Prado's son. "I think something like that could happen to 
me and it makes me think I should never be prejudiced against anybody." 
</P>
<P>
 The controversy caught teacher Andrea Allen by surprise. The book is part of 
the regular honors curriculum and when she last taught it two years ago, not 
one parent objected. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the book is wonderful," she said. "I tell the kids: 'When you are 
reading it, if you are not feeling any emotional pain, then something is wrong 
with the way you are reading it. I want you to take a good look at what man can 
do to man.' " 
</P>
<P>
 It is precisely that message that critics say made "Black Boy" a milestone in 
African American literature. Over time, the book has become required reading in 
high schools and universities around the country. 
</P>
<P>
 "Wright was one of the first black writers to try to focus on the rage that 
arises from the black urban experience," said Richard Yarborough, an associate 
professor of English and Afro-American Studies at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 Wright described his childhood and adolescence as a minefield fraught with 
bigotry and physical and mental abuse -- from his black friends and relatives, 
mired in their poverty and ignorance, as well as from whites. 
</P>
<P>
 No matter how he attempted to cope, Wright found himself unable to fit within 
the narrow, confining roles prescribed to blacks in turn-of-the-century 
America. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew what was wrong with me, but I could not correct it," he wrote. "The 
words and actions of white people were baffling signs to me. I was living in a 
culture and not a civilization and I could learn how that culture worked only 
by living with it. 
</P>
<P>
 "While standing before a white man I had to figure out how to perform each act 
and how to say each word," he continues. "I could not help it. I could not 
grin. . . . I could not react as the world in which I lived expected me to; 
that world was too baffling, too uncertain."  
</P>
<P>
 Wright graphically describes key events in his life to drive home how 
abhorrent conditions and abusive relationships can lead to a lifetime of 
resentment and occasional outbursts. One such description that some in Fillmore 
mention repeatedly is the "kitten passage."  
</P>
<P>
 Wright writes how, as a child, he hated his father's constant beatings and 
temper. One day, a meowing kitten drove Wright's father into a rage and he 
bellowed at his son to " 'kill that damn thing. . . . Do anything, but get it 
away from here!' " 
</P>
<P>
 Seething at this unreasonable reaction, the boy decided to take his father 
literally. He quickly strung a noose and hanged the kitten. 
</P>
<P>
 "It gasped, slobbered, spun, doubled, clawed the air frantically," he writes. 
"Finally, its mouth gaped and its pink-white tongue shot out stiffly." 
</P>
<P>
 This is the kind of writing that alarms Marion Holladay, whose daughter 
Spring, a 10th-grader, is reading Willa Cather's "My Antonia" instead of "Black 
Boy." 
</P>
<P>
 "I know there are a lot of books out there that are better quality than this," 
she said. "I don't understand how somebody could read it and not see what's 
wrong with it." 
</P>
<P>
 Allen said she began rereading the book after the complaints and quickly 
realized her mistake in not sending a notification letter home. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, she said, this is a district where parents regularly object to 
their children reading "Catcher in the Rye," and "Lord of the Flies." 
</P>
<P>
 "Yep, I should've seen it," she said. "And for my own sanity I will do that 
next time. It is very difficult to teach a class when some of your students are 
in the library." 
</P>
<P>
 But for each parent who refuses to get near the book, there are many others 
reading it because of all the uproar and finding they like it very much. 
</P>
<P>
 "The reality of life is that it's not always sweet and children need to be 
exposed to that kind of thing," said Jan Lee, whose son Ryan, 14, is in the 
class. "If a child who is 14 years old goes out and kills a kitten, then they 
have a real problem and it's not the book that caused it."

CONGREGATION FINDS A TIME FOR HEALING; DISASTER: A WEEK AFTER AN ALABAMA CHURCH 
WAS DEVASTATED BY A DEADLY TORNADO, MEMBERS GATHER IN THE PARKING LOT AND 
COMFORT EACH OTHER.

 Thirteen- year-old Marcus Woods fidgeted in his wheelchair and shivered in the 
chill before dawn. He had insisted on attending Easter sunrise service at the 
church where he lost half his family a week earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just wanted to be here," he said softly. 
</P>
<P>
 His father, Buddy, and 9-year-old sister, Amy, were among 20 people killed 
when a tornado leveled the Goshen United Methodist Church during Palm Sunday 
services last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Marcus, who tried to pull his little sister out of the rubble that covered 
her, suffered a badly bruised right knee. His mother is still hospitalized in 
intensive care; she suffered a crushed pelvis and broken legs. 
</P>
<P>
 As much as a celebration of the holiday, Sunday's half-hour service was an 
emotional reunion of tears and lengthy hugs. 
</P>
<P>
 About 200 people attended, sitting on folding chairs in the parking lot of the 
ruined church. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rev. Kelly Clem greeted parishioners, some for the first time since the 
tornado. Her dress was dark red, her lace collar white, and her bruised 
forehead and eyes purple and crimson. 
</P>
<P>
 Battered by whirling bricks, the 34-year-old pastor lost her 4-year-old 
daughter, Hannah, one of six children killed while waiting to participate in an 
Easter program. 
</P>
<P>
 Friends and relatives took turns hugging her and her 2-year-old girl, Sarah. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no place I'd rather be today," she said. "We kind of need each 
other," said her husband, the Rev. Dale Clem. 
</P>
<P>
 Kelly Clem read from the Bible and chatted over a microphone with small 
children. She presented the children with wrapped Easter baskets, among the 
many donations of money, supplies and children's gifts that have streamed in 
from across the country. 
</P>
<P>
 The wooden cross behind her pulpit was made last week by a friend she had not 
seen in years, she said, and a Roman Catholic church sent four new stained 
glass windows that made a backdrop. 
</P>
<P>
 She pledged to rebuild the northeastern Alabama church, the hardest-hit site 
in the series of tornadoes and storms that killed at least 44 people across the 
Southeast. 
</P>
<P>
 For parishioners, the service was a confrontation with traumatic memories. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a moment when we got out in the parking lot and looked at the church. 
I guess we had a special cry," said Craig Rhinehart, 22, whose fiancee, Denise 
Parker, was on crutches because of a pelvic fracture. Two of Rhinehart's uncles 
and two cousins were killed by the tornado. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are the Easter people," the Rev. Robert Fannin, bishop of the North 
Alabama Methodist Conference, told the worshipers. "We believe that life has 
conquered death."

RECORDS SHOW ZHIRINOVSKY HAD A JEWISH NAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Public records show that Vladimir V. Zhirinovsky, the Russian ultranationalist 
leader who campaigns on anti-Semitic themes, had a Jewish last name until age 
18. 
</P>
<P>
 Zhirinovsky vehemently denies that he or his parents are Jewish. Zhirinovsky's 
origins have political significance in Russia because of his attacks on Jews, 
and the documents raise questions about his candor. 
</P>
<P>
 The public records were found by a reporter working for the Associated Press 
and Cable News Network in four archives in Almaty, Kazakhstan, the city where 
Zhirinovsky was born and raised. 
</P>
<P>
 Zhirinovsky's Liberal Democratic Party won 23.5% of the national vote in 
December's parliamentary elections, and he has said he will run for Russia's 
presidency in 1996. Much of his political strength rests on extreme 
nationalists who are virulently anti-Semitic. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the records do not say specifically who his father was, Zhirinovsky's 
surname was listed on his birth registration as Eidelshtein. Documents show he 
applied for and received permission to change his name from Eidelshtein to 
Zhirinovsky in June, 1964. 
</P>
<P>
 That was just before he moved to Moscow from Kazakhstan, in what was then 
Soviet Central Asia, for higher education. Ethnic quotas for universities at 
the time held back many Jewish or Jewish-sounding students. Zhirinovsky won a 
place in the prestigious Institute of Oriental Languages, affiliated with 
Moscow State University. 
</P>
<P>
 The worn, handwritten documents at the Almaty (formerly Alma-Ata) archives 
were retrieved from dusty shelves and cardboard boxes in response to a 
reporter's inquiries. Officials at the archives said they were authentic. 
</P>
<P>
 In Moscow, Grigory Serebrennikov, a spokesman for Zhirinovsky's party, said, 
"The documents clearly have been forged." 
</P>
<P>
 Zhirinovsky's autobiography, "The Final March South," claims that his father 
was named Volf Andreyevich Zhirinovsky, but no records could be found for such 
a man in Almaty. Details about the father in the autobiography seem to combine 
elements from his mother's two husbands. 
</P>
<P>
 One husband was Andrei Vasilyevich Zhirinovsky who, documents show, died of 
tuberculosis in August, 1944, 18 months before Zhirinovsky's birth on April 25, 
1946. 
</P>
<P>
 A marriage registration shows that five months before Zhirinovsky was born, 
his mother married Volf Isakovich Eidelshtein, who was officially listed as 
Jewish.

PROTESTER BERATES CLINTON AT CHURCH; DISSENT: AGENTS SHIELD FIRST FAMILY AS 
SHOUTS ABOUT AIDS POLICY RING FROM BALCONY AT EASTER SERVICES. SAME MAN 
INTERRUPTED A SPEECH IN DECEMBER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 An AIDS protester shouting from the balcony disrupted Easter Sunday church 
services attended by President Clinton, his wife and daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 Two Secret Service agents sitting in a pew directly behind the Clintons jumped 
to their feet and shielded the couple after a man yelled: "Save your prayers 
for Bill Clinton!" 
</P>
<P>
 The disruption occurred about midway through the service at the Foundry United 
Methodist Church, breaking the silence immediately after a reading from the New 
Testament. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton later said he was not bothered by the disruption. The same protester 
interrupted a Clinton speech in December, prompting the President to say then: 
"I'd rather that man be in here screaming at me than having given up 
altogether." 
</P>
<P>
 The Clintons took advantage of the bright, warm Easter, eating brunch at a 
riverside restaurant after the church services. Returning home, they posed 
briefly for the White House photographer for a family portrait. Hillary Clinton 
wore a two-piece lavender suit with a matching hat; Clinton wore a gray suit. 
They were accompanied by their daughter, Chelsea, and one of her friends. 
</P>
<P>
 The President later proclaimed today a "National Day of Reconciliation," in 
honor of the Easter season, Passover and the 26th anniversary of the death of 
Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 "We must remain a nation that is not too cynical to restore hope, not too 
frightened to face our problems, and not too intolerant to seek 
reconciliation," he said in the proclamation released by the White House. 
</P>
<P>
 The AIDS protester identified himself as Luke Montgomery and later told 
authorities that he had legally changed his name to Luke Sissyfag, Secret 
Service spokesman Dave Adams said. 
</P>
<P>
 During his outburst, he also shouted: "Where's the Manhattan Project . . . for 
AIDS? Bill Clinton lied!" 
</P>
<P>
 He referred to Clinton's campaign promise of a federal AIDS program similar to 
the effort that produced the atomic bomb. 
</P>
<P>
 The protester, who was with an unidentified man, was led out of the church by 
parishioners. Adams said he agreed to go to the Secret Service's offices for 
questioning and would not be detained. 
</P>
<P>
 "No threats were made against the President," Adams said.

AMERICAN ALBUM; PUBLIC ENEMY IS NO. 1 ATTRACTION IN QUIET TOWN; LEGACY OF 
GANGSTER JOHN DILLINGER LIVES IN WAX. MUSEUM INCLUDES HIS SHOES, HIS PANTS AND 
HIS PALS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LAURA A. GALLOWAY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Doors often go unlocked in this peaceful hamlet -- the kind of place where 
police officers are more likely chatting with townspeople than arresting 
dangerous criminals. 
</P>
<P>
 It's an unlikely place to honor one of America's most notorious gangsters. 
</P>
<P>
 But here, tucked among the arts-and-crafts shops, stands the John Dillinger 
Historical Wax Museum. It is one of the most incongruous things in Nashville, 
along with the old log cabin jail and a stuffed animal known as the "two-headed 
calf of Brown County." 
</P>
<P>
 The museum houses the world's largest display of Dillinger memorabilia, from 
his baseball shoes to the pants, now stained with blood, that he wore on the 
day he was shot to death by a G-man. 
</P>
<P>
 In his 32 years, Dillinger, who lived in the nearby town of Mooresville, 
robbed 11 banks, looted police stations for ammunition and managed a carefully 
planned escape from a jail using a fake gun made of wood.  
</P>
<P>
 Accused of one murder during his career, Dillinger became the focal point of 
then-FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover's attempt to increase the agency's visibility 
during the Depression. The gangster was listed as Public Enemy No. 1 before 
being shot and killed by an FBI agent while leaving a Chicago movie theater 
with his girlfriend and Anna Sage, the "Lady in Red" who helped the agency in 
its manhunt. 
</P>
<P>
 The museum was started in 1975 by Joe Pinkston and Bart Hahn, two men with a 
lifelong interest in Dillinger and his effect on the U.S. crime scene. 
</P>
<P>
 Pinkston was 3 when Dillinger died, but his fascination grew as he listened to 
stories told by his uncle, a reporter who knew the gangster as a teen-ager and 
later covered his exploits as a journalist. 
</P>
<P>
 The stories -- particularly one about Dillinger shooting pool in the nearby 
town of Martinsville and promptly leaving whenever he lost a dollar -- stuck 
with Pinkston, a former detective and co-author of the book "Dillinger: A Short 
and Violent Life." He had collected a number of Dillinger's belongings after 
concluding research on the book, and a small showing of the items convinced the 
men that a museum could be a success. 
</P>
<P>
 The museum's 22 wax figures, created in Long Beach, Calif., at Alvarez Wax 
Models, chronicle the pivotal moments in Dillinger's career, as well as other 
key players of the Depression-era crime scene. 
</P>
<P>
 There is the Lady in Red. Bonnie and Clyde are posed among repeater paper-shot 
shells, an old Texas map and hand grenades. Pretty Boy Floyd and Baby Face 
Nelson are there too. 
</P>
<P>
 Also behind the glass, a plump, elderly woman in a pink dress and Sunday hat 
stands primly, clutching a semiautomatic weapon. It's Ma Barker, America's most 
feared gangster grandmother. 
</P>
<P>
 In another display, a pallid Dillinger lies on a slab in the morgue, a bloody 
sheet covering most of his body. 
</P>
<P>
 The three-room museum draws several thousand visitors a year from around the 
world, Pinkston said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I suppose it's probably old-fashioned thinking, but the guys who come here 
don't surprise me," the 62-year-old Pinkston said. "They're into things like 
guns. But the girls that come along -- I don't know if they would have liked to 
have been gun molls or what, but they really get into it." 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Yonover of New York has journeyed to the museum several times. 
</P>
<P>
 "John Dillinger was just a cool guy." he said. "The clothes, the women, the 
whole mystique. This is just about the only place you can see all this real, 
traditional crime stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 Other Dillinger belongings in the museum include his lucky rabbit's foot and 
the Colt .35 pistol that FBI agent Charles Winstead used to kill him. Even the 
plaster "death mask" made by mortuary students after Dillinger's death is 
there. 
</P>
<P>
 Nashville gained popularity in the early 1960s as a retreat for Indiana 
University art students who wanted to live a simple existence honing their 
crafts. 
</P>
<P>
 Some here have expressed concern that the museum is not in keeping with the 
town's image. Pinkston is quick to disagree. "It's history. It isn't only about 
Dillinger. It's about guns, it's about cars, it's about banks and the FBI. It's 
American history."  
</P>
<P>
 While doing research for an upcoming book, Pinkston discovered transcripts 
from state police wiretaps that provide evidence that Dillinger was paid by 
bank executives to commit robberies in order to save institutions suffering 
during the Depression. 
</P>
<P>
 Pinkston said he believes that Dillinger would have his own take on crime in 
today's world: "He would probably be appalled at some of what goes on today -- 
the mindless violence."

S. AFRICA LEADERS SCHEDULE PEACE TALKS AS KILLINGS MOUNT; VIOLENCE: SUMMIT IS 
PLANNED FOR FRIDAY. AT LEAST 40 DEATHS ARE RECORDED IN NATAL PROVINCE OVER 
WEEKEND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From the Washington Post 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Pre-election violence in Natal province continued at a bloody pitch over the 
weekend despite the deployment of more than 1,000 army troops and a state of 
emergency, and South Africa's top political leaders agreed to hold a peace 
summit this Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 At least 40 people have been killed in political violence since Friday, when 
the state of emergency in Natal went into effect, giving police and army troops 
special powers of search, seizure and detention. Most of the victims -- 22 of 
whom were killed Saturday night and early Sunday -- were supporters of the 
African National Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 In the most violent incident since the emergency was imposed, nine people -- 
all women, girls or babies -- were massacred in their village huts in an ANC 
stronghold outside Port Shepstone in southern Natal early Sunday by men 
identified by survivors as Zulu supporters of the Inkatha Freedom Party. 
</P>
<P>
 In another attack Sunday, gunmen armed with AK-47 rifles fired on a group of 
Inkatha supporters praying at an outdoor Easter service in Bhambayi, a 
predominantly ANC settlement outside of Durban. One woman was shot dead. 
</P>
<P>
 The violence is seen -- notably by the ANC and the white-minority government 
-- as an attempt to keep potential voters from going to the polls later this 
month to take part in what will be South Africa's first all-race election. The 
ANC is expected to win, and its bitter rival, Inkatha, is boycotting the vote. 
</P>
<P>
 President Frederik W. de Klerk imposed the state of emergency over Natal after 
six weeks of intensified violence resulted in the heaviest death toll in the 
decade of a low-grade civil war between conservative, traditional and rural 
Zulus who support Inkatha and younger, more progressive and urbanized Zulus who 
support the ANC. 
</P>
<P>
 De Klerk, African National Congress President Nelson Mandela and Zulu and 
Inkatha leader Mangosuthu Gatsha Buthelezi fixed the summit date Sunday when 
the three met at a massive outdoor Easter service for an estimated 1.5 million 
members of the Zion Christian Church in Moria, about 150 miles northeast of 
here. 
</P>
<P>
 The summit, also to be attended by Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini, will address 
ways to curb the escalating political violence, as well as a demand by 
Buthelezi and Zwelithini for postponement of the April 26-28 election, either 
nationally or in the province of Natal and its black homeland of KwaZulu. 
</P>
<P>
 Buthelezi is chief minister of KwaZulu, which, with nine other such 
apartheid-created regions, will cease to exist after the election. 
</P>
<P>
 Military sources said army troops patrolling areas of Natal have so far been 
instructed not to take advantage of their extraordinary powers under the state 
of emergency because De Klerk wants a bargaining chip to bring to the summit 
with Buthelezi and Zwelithini. 
</P>
<P>
 These sources said that unless the two Zulu leaders agree to instruct their 
supporters not to obstruct the election, De Klerk will threaten to use the 
emergency powers to round up Inkatha leaders suspected of fomenting the 
violence. Buthelezi is expected to argue that holding a vote under a state of 
emergency makes a mockery of the notion of a free and fair election.

U.N. PEACE MISSION FLIES TO AFGHANISTAN TO END KILLING; ASIA: TOLL PUT AT 2,500 
KILLED AND 17,000 INJURED IN KABUL. HALF OF THE CAPITAL'S POPULATION MAY HAVE 
FLED. 
</P>

<P>
 With Afghanistan's capital reduced to a shell-battered moonscape inhabited by 
thousands of hungry, homeless people, a U.N. peace mission flew to Kabul over 
the weekend to try to broker an end to nearly two years of brutal fratricide. 
</P>
<P>
 "Finding a solution is the main, if not the only, aim of our visit," the 
leader of the five-member mission, former Tunisian Foreign Minister Mahmoud 
Mestiri, told reporters on his arrival in Kabul from Pakistan. 
</P>
<P>
 The visit by the U.N. delegation was prompted by the unparalleled fighting 
that began in January in and around the mountain-ringed capital -- and the 
harsh consequences for the civilian population. 
</P>
<P>
 An estimated 2,500 people have been killed and 17,000 injured in the street 
battles, artillery duels and aerial attacks that have raged in Kabul, the 
International Committee of the Red Cross said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although no one knows for sure, half of the city's civilian population may 
have fled, leaving behind about 800,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
 Many who stayed have been uprooted by the street-to-street fighting and are 
living in overcrowded, unsanitary public buildings. As the weather warms up, 
health officials fear outbreaks of cholera and other diseases. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is clear that several hundred thousand people living in Kabul don't have a 
basic income to feed their families and don't have regular access to relief 
supplies," Martin Barber, acting director of the U.N. Office for Coordination 
of Humanitarian Assistance to Afghanistan, said in Islamabad, Pakistan.  
</P>
<P>
 For many, food has become the most pressing need. Warfare has deprived most 
Kabul residents of their paying jobs and simultaneously kept food supplies out. 
On Saturday, four private organizations distributed 90 tons of wheat flour that 
had been trucked in from Pakistan, Barber said, but that will only provide 
rations to 25,000 people for 10 days. 
</P>
<P>
 The main belligerents, President Burhanuddin Rabbani and his archrival, Prime 
Minister Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, a hard-line Muslim fundamentalist, agreed to a 
cease-fire during the U.N. delegation visit, which should end today or Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 According to U.N. officials, the Tunisian diplomat wants the widest possible 
exposure to Afghan leaders and ordinary people to see how the United Nations 
might best help stanch the Afghan bloodshed. 
</P>
<P>
 After the Muslim moujahedeen took power from a Soviet-backed regime in April, 
1992, ending 14 years of civil war, a new kind of fighting began -- among rival 
members of the Islamic coalition government. More than 11,000 people have been 
killed as a result. 
</P>
<P>
 Hekmatyar, who has had Pakistani backing, wants Rabbani to resign so an 
interim government can oversee new elections. The pro-Rabbani Cabinet countered 
March 25 with a proposed new political setup, whose keystone would be the 
U.N.-monitored convening of a loya jurga, or great assembly, whose decisions 
are obligatory for all Afghans. 
</P>
<P>
 But Hekmatyar held fast Sunday, telling the U.N. peace mission that Rabbani's 
resignation is the only way to end the fighting.

COLOSIO ASSASSINATION PLOT ALLEGED; MEXICO: ABURTO'S FATHER CLAIMS HIS SON IS 
BEING MADE THE FALL GUY IN A BROAD CONSPIRACY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK J. McDONNELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Less than two weeks before the assassination of Luis Donaldo Colosio, a former 
state police officer who later served on the Mexican presidential candidate's 
security squad invited the man now accused of slaying Colosio to attend a 
meeting, according to the father of the alleged assassin. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruben Aburto said in an interview that his son, Mario Aburto Martinez, the 
confessed killer of Colosio, was asked to the session by Vicente Mayoral 
Valenzuela, one of a group of former policemen recruited to provide crowd 
control during the candidate's fatal campaign swing in Tijuana on March 23. 
</P>
<P>
 "He (Mayoral) invited him to a meeting of a committee," the elder Aburto told 
reporters from The Times and two Mexican newspapers late Saturday in San Pedro, 
the Los Angeles harbor community where the father lives. "He told him that 
delegates from all over the (Mexican) republic would be there." 
</P>
<P>
 While his son didn't specify to his father what the meeting was to be about, 
the use of the words "committee" and "delegate" strongly suggest a political 
theme in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 Aburto's family maintains that he is being made the fall guy for a broader 
assassination plot, perhaps after having been recruited by others. Mexican 
officials have dismissed such a conspiracy, and relatives have no proof. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexican authorities seeking potential accomplices in the attack are believed 
to be focusing on the approximately 45-member volunteer security squad at the 
Tijuana campaign stop. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayoral, a 30-year veteran of the Baja California state judicial police, was 
arrested in the melee immediately after the killing but was later released 
after federal authorities said he was merely a witness who helped subdue the 
gunman. He has not been officially charged in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Relatives of Mayoral's say federal authorities whisked the former police 
official and his son, Rodolfo Mayoral -- who also served on the Colosio 
security detail in Tijuana -- to Mexico City last week for questioning. The 
family vehemently denies any wrongdoing by either man. 
</P>
<P>
 Another security detail member, Tranquilino Sanchez Venegas, has been arrested 
and charged as a "co-participant" in the slaying, although his alleged role has 
never been clarified. In photographs taken moments before the assassination, 
Sanchez is seen near Colosio and Aburto. 
</P>
<P>
 The security contingent was assembled by the Tijuana branch of Mexico's 
Institutional Revolutionary Party, known as PRI, which has governed Mexico 
since its creation in 1929. As the PRI's nominee, Colosio was a heavy favorite 
to win the presidential election scheduled for Aug. 21. 
</P>
<P>
 PRI officials in Tijuana have denounced the killing and offered full 
cooperation in the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 The elder Aburto, 47, said he discussed the matter of Mayoral with his son in 
the family's Tijuana residence March 11 or 12, when the father was visiting. 
Ruben Aburto said he advised his son not to attend any meeting, and he said he 
wasn't sure if Mario went to the session. He also said he counseled his son to 
sever his relationship with Mayoral. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities have generally depicted Aburto as a lone gunman, possibly 
deranged, who may have shot Colosio in a twisted effort to publicize his 
pacifist views.  
</P>
<P>
 Jose Luis Perez Canchola, human rights ombudsman for Baja California, has 
accused officials of using details of Aburto's life as a "smoke screen" to 
conceal details of the extremely sensitive case.

3.4 EARTHQUAKE RATTLES PALM SPRINGS AREA

 A 3.4-magnitude earthquake shook the desert about 30 miles southwest of Palm 
Springs on Sunday evening, Caltech seismologists said.

<P>
 The 8:25 p.m. temblor was not an aftershock of either the Northridge or Big 
Bear earthquakes, according to Caltech seismologist Kathy Willis. 
</P>

 There were no reports of injuries or damage.

ALLIED PAC FUELS HURTT'S POLITICAL DRIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC BAILEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If state Sen. Rob Hurtt is the Republican Party's king of campaigns these 
days, then Allied Business PAC is the money behind the throne. 
</P>
<P>
 In his election battles against the Democrats, Hurtt can count on the 
financial clout of the 2-year-old political action committee he helped form 
with a threesome of wealthy Southern California businessmen who share his firm 
religious beliefs. 
</P>
<P>
 The group first made headlines by backing a broad slate of conservatives that 
clobbered moderate Republican candidates backed by Gov. Pete Wilson in the 
June, 1992, primary. By the end of the year, Allied had poured $1.2 million 
into legislative races, outspending such well-entrenched special interests as 
trial lawyers and the insurance industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with Hurtt, the original members are Howard Ahmanson, a wealthy Newport 
Beach philanthropist; Edward G. Atsinger III of Camarillo, part-owner of 18 
Christian radio stations throughout the country; and Roland Hinz of Mission 
Hills, publisher of dirt-bike magazines. In recent months, Rich Riddle of 
Arcadia, owner of a folding-box company, has come aboard. 
</P>
<P>
 These days, Hurtt is no longer a voting member of the Allied board but 
frequently attends the group's monthly meetings, discussing strategy and 
updating them on events in the state Capitol. Hurtt contends that he has no 
control over the way Allied doles out money. 
</P>
<P>
 But members of Allied don't hesitate to tell Hurtt what they think. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone associated with our group sees it as their duty to ride herd on him 
to make sure he doesn't become part of the machine," said Roberta Ahmanson, 
wife of the group's media-shy co-founder. "I think Rob is trying real hard to 
maintain his ideals." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the group is mostly happy with Hurtt. If his free-enterprise acumen 
and feisty character have rubbed some liberals the wrong way, that's great. 
"He's used to speaking his mind," Roberta Ahmanson said. "He's a straight 
shooter." 
</P>
<P>
 Privately, some Republicans complain about blunders they feel Hurtt and Allied 
have made. Among them -- initially backing an insurance industry lobbyist for a 
suburban Sacramento Assembly seat eventually won by Barbara Alby (R-Fair Oaks). 
Others question why Hurtt weighed in heavily on behalf of Republican Joe 
Ghougassian in a losing Senate fight against San Diego Democrat Steve Peace 
last December. 
</P>
<P>
 During 1992-93, Allied poured money into nearly three dozen Senate or Assembly 
campaigns, winning in about half. 
</P>
<P>
 Of late, Hurtt has gotten flack from fellow Republicans over primary 
endorsements in his home turf of Orange County. In particular, Assemblyman Gil 
Ferguson (R-Newport Beach) was irate when he heard that Hurtt and Ahmanson had 
endorsed Irvine Councilman Barry J. Hammond for the assemblyman's seat.

<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 What are my legal and ethical responsibilities when parking in a mini-mall or 
strip mall that has signs limiting each parking space to a certain business? 
</P>
<P>
 Are they trying to intimidate me, or should I just park where I want? 
</P>
<P>
 Bruce Galt 
</P>
<P>
 North Hollywood 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Reader: 
</P>
<P>
 As to whether the mall management is trying to intimidate you, it's impossible 
to say. But the mall's owners are perfectly within their rights to dispose of 
their parking spaces however they wish, according to city officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to bear in mind that that's private property," says Jack Reynolds of 
the Los Angeles Department of Transportation, "and the owners of that property 
can designate who they want to park in various spaces." 
</P>
<P>
 Enforcing their will is another matter. 
</P>
<P>
 If proprietors want the city to be their watchdog, they must first post signs 
stating the parking limitations and citing the municipal or vehicle codes that 
a scofflaw would violate by parking there, Reynolds says. 
</P>
<P>
 Even then, a city parking bouncer would only make an appearance if the 
management complains, not as part of any general patrol. When it comes to 
private property, Reynolds says, the only violations the city routinely sweeps 
for are misuse of handicapped spaces and blocking designated fire lanes. 
</P>
<P>
 So the odds of beating the system are probably in your favor if you're parking 
for just a few minutes in a space allotted to a dry cleaner when you've really 
stopped to buy milk. 
</P>
<P>
 But that's where your ethical responsibilities come in. Street Smart can't 
help you on that one. 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 While I realize my eyes are aging and more sensitive to light, is there 
anything that can be done about motorists who insist on either: A) using high 
beams while driving under perfect conditions on well-lighted streets and 
freeways, or B) using both pairs of headlights (top) and fog lights (bottom) 
under ordinary driving conditions? 
</P>
<P>
 Nancy Victor 
</P>
<P>
 North Hollywood 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Reader: 
</P>
<P>
 Street Smart is happy to illuminate this issue for you. 
</P>
<P>
 When it comes to fog lights, Officer Glen Dominguez of the California Highway 
Patrol says the right time to use them is in inclement weather and, fittingly 
enough, fog. 
</P>
<P>
 "Otherwise they're not really needed," he says. But neither are they illegal 
to have on under ordinary driving conditions, unless they actually disrupt 
traffic by blinding motorists. 
</P>
<P>
 High beams are another story. A motorist driving with his high beams on must 
dim them to normal strength within 500 feet of an oncoming driver (who usually 
gives a reminder by flashing his own highs). When approaching another car from 
behind, you must switch off your high beams within 300 feet. 
</P>
<P>
 That's the law. "We can cite you on that one," Dominguez says. 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 When you head south on Lankershim Boulevard into Universal City, the left-turn 
lane onto Universal Terrace Parkway is a disaster. There are way too many cars 
making a left turn, and there is only one lane. It needs a left-turn arrow 
desperately. Can something be done about this? 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Stanger 
</P>
<P>
 Studio City 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Reader: 
</P>
<P>
 You'll be pleased to learn that something is being done. 
</P>
<P>
 According to city transportation engineer Brian Gallagher, the area you 
mention is undergoing traffic improvements right now, courtesy of private 
funding from MCA, the entertainment giant that owns Universal Studios. 
</P>
<P>
 By summer, Gallagher says, there should be a longer left-turn lane for cars to 
queue up, and a new left-turn arrow will be installed. The new signal will be 
of the "protective-permissive" variety, which allows motorists to make a 
protected left turn with the arrow and then, when the arrow fades to a regular 
green light, to turn when they judge it safe. 
</P>
<P>
 Furthermore, by the year 2000, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority will 
add a second left-turn lane onto Universal Terrace Parkway, to coincide with 
the opening of a new subway station on Lankershim. The additional turn lane 
will be part of a 22-foot widening of Lankershim that the authority agreed to 
perform under an agreement it struck with MCA after a fractious debate over the 
planned Metro Rail station location.

FOOD FOR THOUGHT; CHURCH'S EGG HUNT HOLDS EASTER LESSON FOR CHILDREN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF McDONALD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Seven-year-old Carmen Gonzalez carefully positioned herself at the front of a 
hungry crowd, eager to pounce on the multitude of colored eggs spread out 
before her. 
</P>
<P>
 In an instant, a rush of children sprang across the thick green lawn at St. 
Peter Claver Church in Simi Valley, sweeping up eggs as fast as their tiny 
hands would allow. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got Runts, Twix, Sweet Tarts and Starburst," the Simi Valley girl said, 
moments after competing in the church's annual Easter egg hunt. "I almost 
tripped over an egg." 
</P>
<P>
 Across Ventura County, people celebrated Easter Sunday with a host of 
observances, egg hunts and other traditional events, filling churches and 
reflecting on what the holiday means to them. 
</P>
<P>
 "They really like to see the Easter bunny," said Jason Williamson, a St. Peter 
Claver volunteer dressed Sunday as the holiday hare and handing out scoops of 
chocolate eggs and jelly beans to excited children. "It enlightens them." 
</P>
<P>
 Williamson said the holiday gives children a chance to feed their imaginations 
while learning about tradition. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think kids are exposed too much to reality," he said. "They need to believe 
in fairy tales." 
</P>
<P>
 But the church egg hunt was no make-believe story. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousands of brightly colored eggs awaited hundreds of children after the 10 
a.m. service, although each child was limited to four eggs, which were 
exchanged for candy bars and other edible treasures. 
</P>
<P>
 Just behind the starting line of the 8- to 10-year-old section, Michelle 
Skinner of Simi Valley waited with her 9-year-old son, Jeremy, for the mad dash 
to begin. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not the candy," she said. "It's the fun of trying to get out there and 
get those eggs. It's the mad dash to the eggs, and then to get the candy." 
</P>
<P>
 Nearby, Tricia Stoller scanned the crowd, seeking out her two boys, 
Christopher, 6, and Thomas, 3. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even Christmas doesn't get like this," she said, referring to the sheer 
numbers of camera-clutching parents and sweets-seeking youngsters dressed in 
their Sunday best. "This is a really big crowd." 
</P>
<P>
 For Jennifer Wilkins, 10, of Simi Valley, Sunday's Easter egg hunt was her 
last. Next year, she will be over the age limit, but that didn't concern her 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "You get four eggs and you get a handful of candy," Jennifer said. 
</P>
<P>
 But she also knew the true spirit of Easter. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a time for loving your family," she said, slipping a hand into her 
3-year-old sister's basket of candy. 
</P>
<P>
 At Libbey Bowl in Ojai, where roosters crowed between the lessons of Father 
Dennis Mulkey, Chester Perry of Ojai listened closely. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been coming here for years," said Perry, an Ojai Valley mortician. "It's 
a celebration of the Resurrection of Jesus and, in my business, it's nice to 
have faith. I see a lot of death, and this represents life to me." 
</P>
<P>
 K. K. Chase, a sales representative from Ojai, said she had never experienced 
so intimate a sunrise service, which was attended by more than 100 people. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was nice to be outside for a change," she said of the interdenominational 
event. "And it's nice to hear other pastors and be in a service where there are 
other faiths." 
</P>
<P>
 Chase, who said it was her first time at the outdoor service, listened to the 
sermon as squirrels darted across tree branches enshrouding the amphitheater 
and dogs lay quietly by their owners. 
</P>
<P>
 "Usually it's sunny and warm, so I'm not used to having rain," Chase said. 
"But the animals and roosters are part of the chain. It's part of Ojai." 
</P>
<P>
 Fred and Nancy Bull of Sun City, visiting their children and grandchildren in 
Ojai, said they found the early-morning sermon uplifting. 
</P>
<P>
 "I liked the message of the Resurrection and what that's all about," said 
Bull, who came to the service with Squeaky, a charcoal-black Shetland sheep 
dog. 
</P>
<P>
 "She came to pray, too," he said of the family pet.

BUSINESS LEADERS PROTEST RULINGS; THOUSAND OAKS: SOME SAY THEY ARE FED UP WITH 
THE CITY'S REJECTION OF DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS. OFFICIALS SAY RULINGS REFLECT 
WILL OF MAJORITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATTHEW MOSK, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Concerned about a recent tide of rulings against developers in Thousand Oaks, 
area business leaders have begun meeting informally to examine whether the city 
is violating the rights of property owners. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the group say they are fed up with the city's rejection of a string 
of projects proposed by property owners and developers in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials have said repeatedly that they are simply carrying out the will 
of the majority of Thousand Oaks residents, who wish to preserve open space and 
limit the city's growth. 
</P>
<P>
 But developers point to inconsistencies in several recent rulings that they 
say raise questions about the city's planning process. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody here is taking issue with the rules that are already in place to 
prevent a lot of growth in the city," said architect Neal Scribner, who helped 
start the as-yet unnamed group. 
</P>
<P>
 "But what we're seeing is the rules being tossed out the window," he said. 
"The city has been terribly inconsistent. There's just no sense in it." 
</P>
<P>
 Scribner pointed to several recent City Council and Planning Commission 
decisions that he said showed how the city rejects developments that follow 
planning guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
 Those projects include a proposed housing and commercial development by 
Nedjatollah Cohan on 47 acres of land in Newbury Park, a commercial development 
on property near Janss Mall and a proposed zoning change on land near Conejo 
Community Park. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we're finding is that there are dozens of cases," Scribner said. "One of 
the things this group may want to do is start to document the examples." 
</P>
<P>
 The group, which was initially made up of representatives from the Conejo 
Valley Chamber of Commerce and Conejo Valley Assn. of Realtors, held its first 
meeting in January and plans to meet again this month. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our primary goal in meeting like this is to come up with a way to convince 
the city fathers to follow their own rules," said Gene Baker, a Thousand Oaks 
architect. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want this to be a confrontational group; we want to work with the 
city," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Planning Commissioner Mervyn Kopp said he was invited to attend the group's 
first meeting but was unable to attend. He said he agrees, however, that 
several issues being raised by the group need to be addressed by city 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem, as I see it, is that we appear to be looking for ways to say no 
to a project instead of looking for reasons to say yes," Kopp said. 
</P>
<P>
 An example of this, according to Kopp and members of the newly formed group, 
is the city's effort to change the zoning on property owned by Cohan in Newbury 
Park. Kopp has supported development of the Cohan property. 
</P>
<P>
 But the city has raised a host of objections to development on Cohan's parcel 
in the past 12 years, including most recently the suggestion that a rare 
species of cuckoo bird might be nesting there. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here's a guy who had his project approved by the Planning Commission, 
rejected by the City Council; he's fought with the state, and now the city is 
trying to downzone it," Scribner said. "It's really crazy." 
</P>
<P>
 Cohan's son, Albert Cohen, has consistently argued that the city is simply 
looking for excuses to prevent development where it should reasonably be 
allowed. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have done everything right and they continue to tell us no," Cohen said 
after the Planning Commission voted in March to change the zoning on his 
family's property to further limit development. That recommendation must still 
be approved by the City Council. "Apparently there are property rights for 
everyone living around the development, but not for us." 
</P>
<P>
 But city officials see the debate over Cohan's property differently. 
</P>
<P>
 "There have been several problems with development there, and the city has 
been well within its rights because at no time have we eliminated the total use 
of the property," Deputy City Atty. Bob Rogers said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem with (Cohan's project), and with most of the projects we're 
seeing these days, is that the easy decisions are gone," he said. "Now the 
properties being discussed for development are the tough ones, the ones with 
problems." 
</P>
<P>
 In Cohan's case, the city has objected to development near wetlands on his 
property. With other projects, the city has raised flags when developers 
propose building on steep slopes or near ridgelines. 
</P>
<P>
 Rogers said property owners have been frustrated because the city has been 
strict in its protection of ridgelines, wetlands and other natural resources. 
</P>
<P>
 And, says Planning Commission Chairman Irving Wasserman, many residents agree 
with that philosophy. 
</P>
<P>
 "We try very hard to keep in mind the attitude survey of the city," Wasserman 
said, referring to a 1989 polling of residents on local issues. "We want to 
ensure that property owners are able to use their land, but the community has 
rights as well, and we have to keep those in mind too." 
</P>
<P>
 And Thousand Oaks residents want to have input on how development is handled 
by the city, the survey showed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the reason this city is so desirable is because of that input," said 
Cathy Schutz, president of the Westlake Joint Board of homeowners associations. 
"There has got to be a give-and-take, but input from existing communities is 
certainly an essential ingredient." 
</P>
<P>
 But relying too strongly on community opinion can create more problems, Kopp 
said. Vocal residents who protest development on neighboring lots are creating 
a situation where the people who built first have the advantage, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a clear case of 'not-in-my-back yard' politics, where people have 
seen an empty lot next door and, once they move in, they don't want anyone else 
to build," Kopp said. 
</P>
<P>
 The "not-in-my-back yard" syndrome is an issue the group intends to address, 
Baker said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to come up with a way to take these peoples' concerns into 
consideration, but not allow them to totally relieve us of our rights as 
property owners," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the reasons the group has formed to discuss these issues, Scribner 
said, is that questions of property rights will eventually affect everyone, 
including people who already own their homes. 
</P>
<P>
 "If this is left unchallenged, we're leaving ourselves open to a lot of 
potential problems," Scribner said. "There's great power in controlling someone 
else's land, and we have to keep an eye on that."

VALLEY CHRONICLE: 400 VALLEY FANS WARM UP FOR START OF -- YES -- CRICKET SEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUE REILLY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Cricket is a sport, not just an insect, to millions of people now living in, 
or expatriated from, what was once the far-flung British Empire. 
</P>
<P>
 Cricket has some resemblance to the great American game of baseball. Sort of 
how a cucumber tea sandwich resembles a Big Mac. 
</P>
<P>
 Included in the hundreds of thousands of people playing this game around the 
world are about 400 in the San Fernando Valley who are warming up for the 
beginning of the Southern California Cricket Assn. season, which begins 
Saturday at Van Nuys' Woodley Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Cricket is a game played with a bat and a ball on a large field. But that's 
where familiarity ends. The object seems to be for the batters to score runs 
while the pitcher tries to knock a stick off a pole. First the pitcher pitches 
one way, then turns around and pitches the other way. Then people run around. 
</P>
<P>
 Then everyone comes off the field to observe tea time. 
</P>
<P>
 It's wonderful, but weird. Spectators do not boo the umpire or harass the 
players. Playing positions are known as wicket keeper, slips, gully, third man, 
cover, silly mid off, silly mid on, square leg, etc. 
</P>
<P>
 The pitcher is called the bowler and he is changed often during an inning in 
which one of the 10 batsmen per inning may score between 300 and 400 runs. An 
inning may go on for days. 
</P>
<P>
 Wickets are three stumps placed upright, with crosspieces balanced in the 
groves of the stumps. A dislodged crosspiece retires the batsman and, some 
might say, not a moment too soon. 
</P>
<P>
 Got all that? 
</P>
<P>
 If this were not such a beautiful sport to watch, with the teams and umpires 
all dressed in white as if they were going to a garden party, one might think 
that this game was thought up by the Monty Python gang. 
</P>
<P>
 Cuban-born Jean Wong of Northridge is a part-French and part-Chinese 
cricketeer who learned the game while growing up in Jamaica. He is now 
president of the Southern California Cricket Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 A general contractor and resident of the Valley since 1967, he has played 
cricket here since 1962 and, at age 58, is still playing, now with the Golden 
Oldies team. 
</P>
<P>
 He says the association started in 1932 when English actor Sir Aubrey Smith 
decided to organize a game or two for the English in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first games were played in Griffith Park and included players like Errol 
Flynn, Boris Karloff and Ronald Coleman. We still have pictures of those old 
games," Wong said. 
</P>
<P>
 The games drew great crowds and were almost as star-studded as the polo games 
played at Will Rogers' polo field. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sir Aubrey was well-connected in the movie business, so all the aspiring 
actors from England and Australia were anxious to play on his teams," Wong 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 From that showy beginning grew what is now the Southern California Cricket 
Assn., which has 37 clubs with 1,250 players playing from early April until 
November in locations from San Diego to Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Wong, Southern California players come from England, Scotland, 
Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, the West Indies, India, Pakistan, 
Hong Kong and other places that once fell under the influence of England. 
</P>
<P>
 Age is no handicap, it seems, as many players are still going strong in their 
50s. One is 53-year-old Van Nuys resident David Heaney, who arrived in the 
Valley from Australia in 1973 and has been playing center field with the 
Pegasus team almost ever since. 
</P>
<P>
 Heaney says he likes the camaraderie with the other Southern California 
players. "Cricket is very social; we tend to party together a lot," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Wong, it is love of the sport that brings them together. 
</P>
<P>
 Wong says the association does have a juniors program but that many Americans 
find the game confusing and too difficult to learn. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not like soccer, where you run around for awhile and then it's over," 
Wong said. "It's a complex game." 
</P>
<P>
 Wong says the games at Woodley Park, off Woodley Avenue between Burbank and 
Victory boulevards, do attract spectators. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we have teams from out of town, or other countries, sometimes we have as 
many as 3,000 watching," he said. Usually the number is between 30 and 300. The 
curious may watch, free of charge. 
</P>
<P>
 "People should come with their families and a picnic basket. Bring your own 
chairs," Wong said. Neighborhood Is Getting Stoned 
</P>
<P>
 There's a part of Van Nuys that has been getting stoned for about eight years 
now. 
</P>
<P>
 Stoned in the sense that the Stones are making their presence known. 
</P>
<P>
 Alan Stone is a graphic designer who lends aid and support to his wife, Terry. 
Terry Stone is, quite simply, a dynamo. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple and their son live in an area she has named the Pocket, bordered by 
Balboa Boulevard, Hayvenhurst Avenue and the Bull Creek Wash. 
</P>
<P>
 "Alan and I moved to this area from Silver Lake eight years ago when I was 
pregnant with my son, Christopher. We wanted to live in a real neighborhood," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had been totally burned out by all of the activist work I'd done in the 
'60s and '70s. None of it seemed to have done any good." 
</P>
<P>
 "All I wanted was to raise my child and be active in my own community. I was 
sick of those organizations that said what a good cause they were, then took 
your money and disappeared," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Once an activist, always an activist applies to Terry. 
</P>
<P>
 First it was the Pocket Patrol, then it was Pocket Notes. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pocket Patrol is the neighborhood group she helped organize; it watches 
out for anything untoward in the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we started getting graffitied, we staked out the area at night with a 
lot of people with walkie-talkies and the help of our local police. We caught 
the perpetrators and haven't had much of a problem since," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pocket Notes is a monthly neighborhood newspaper the Stones started about 
three years ago. "Alan and I do it for the 250 families in the Pocket. We keep 
everyone up-to-date on what's going on," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not about neighborhood barbecues, although Terry Stone says the 
neighborhood has them. "It's about who is moving in and out, police problems, 
schools, things that impact us in our little community," she said. "We get 
items from people all over the Pocket and even from people who have moved out." 
</P>
<P>
 Stone says you would never mistake her area for Encino. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are middle class, working class, and there's a wonderful racial and age 
mix. What is going on is that we are taking pride in our neighborhood and we 
are looking out for each other," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 You would never mistake Stone for a lady who lunches, either. 
</P>
<P>
 One of her favorite community events is "caroling" throughout the neighborhood 
in observance of Halloween. "We put a karaoke machine on a skateboard and go 
around and have a ball," she said. Overheard: 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to play in the boys' soccer league because I'm too good to play 
in the girls' league. I want to play in the boys' league because I like boys."

MOTIVE SOUGHT IN WOMAN'S SLAYING; VIOLENCE: MINA CASTANEDA OF OXNARD WAS 
ALLEGEDLY SHOT ON A QUIET SANTA PAULA STREET BY HER HUSBAND, WHO IS BEING HELD 
BY POLICE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Police on Sunday were trying to determine what started a violent argument that 
resulted in an Oxnard man allegedly shooting his wife dead on the sidewalk of a 
quiet Santa Paula street. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Paula police were called about 9 p.m. Saturday to the 200 block of 
Wakeford Avenue on the city's west side with a report that a woman had been 
shot, according to Cmdr. Robert Gonzales. 
</P>
<P>
 When officers arrived, they found Mina Castaneda, 24, on the sidewalk outside 
a corner house near Wakeford Avenue and Bradley Street; she had a single 
gunshot wound to the head. She died a short while later at Santa Paula Memorial 
Hospital, Gonzales said. 
</P>
<P>
 About an hour later, police arrested Jose Santos Castaneda, 25, in connection 
with the shooting death of his wife. The location of his arrest was not 
immediately available. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was arrested without a struggle," Santa Paula Police Agent Troyce Reynolds 
said. "We know this was a domestic dispute, but exactly what sparked this 
violence we still don't know." 
</P>
<P>
 Reynolds said the couple were apparently visiting friends when the violence 
erupted. 
</P>
<P>
 Late Sunday afternoon, with the blood-stained sidewalk serving as a reminder 
of the previous night's violence, neighbors said the incident was unusual for 
the tree-lined street. 
</P>
<P>
 One resident, who declined to give his name, said he heard the single shot and 
ran outside to see what had happened. He tried to stop Castaneda's bleeding 
while others performed cardiopulmonary resuscitation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was trying to put pressure on the wound, but I could tell it wasn't going 
to help," he said. "I could tell she was going. Something like this is a real 
shock. I would have never expected anything like this on this street." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But according to Jamie Leigh, executive director of the Ventura County 
Coalition Against Domestic and Sexual Violence, the fact that the incident took 
place in public was "somewhat rare" but such violence is unfortunately all too 
common. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't point to any particular set of statistics, but certainly over the 
last couple of years, we are hearing more and more cases like this," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Castaneda was booked into Ventura County Jail on suspicion of homicide. He 
remained in custody Sunday in lieu of $250,000 bail.

 Don Cherry, the former Boston Bruin coach, who is now a bombastic television 
commentator for Hockey Night in Canada, had some free advice for King Coach 
Barry Melrose on how to get his team back on a winning track: 
</P>
<P>
 "First of all, I think he's got to get a haircut," Cherry said. "He's got to 
go back to Kelvington, Saskatchewan, and work on the farm with his father. He's 
got to go back to the minors. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's got to forget all this Hollywood stuff. He's got to get back to the 
sweatshop and quit having all those floaters from Hollywood around. . . . He's 
more worried about dyeing the ends of his hair than he is about coaching. He's 
worried about putting gel in his hair."

 Trivia time: Other than UCLA, which schools have won the most NCAA Division I 
basketball championships?

 Circle the wagons: Randy Galloway of the Dallas Morning News: "If you're a 
Cowboys' fan and you read (Jerry) Jones' 'total control' proclamation then it 
is obvious Jerry is taking a personal stand on the future of the two-time 
defending champions of the National Football League.  
</P>
<P>
 "A fellow named Custer also made a similar stand. It became his last one. 
Jones will be no different." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Add Cowboys: Blackie Sherrod of the Dallas Morning News wasn't shocked that 
Barry Switzer replaced Jimmy Johnson as the Dallas coach. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wouldn't have been a shock if Jones had announced Mike Ditka or Tom Landry 
or Hillary Clinton or Boy George. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey, it's his railroad. He can run it off a cliff if he dang well wants to, 
and if you lose any sleep over it, you're a sucker."

 Previous commitment: Seton Hall Coach P.J. Carlesimo, good-naturedly noting 
that his friend, Duke Coach Mike Krzyzewski missed a national college 
basketball coaches' news conference in Charlotte, N.C.:

 "Where is he most years? -- selfishly trying to win another national 
championship."

 Style analysis: Steve Jacobson of Newsday comparing the NBA champion New York 
Knicks of the 1970s to the current Knick team:  
</P>

NEWSWIRE: CRENSHAW'S PUTTING LEADS TO THREE-SHOT VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ben Crenshaw, his putting touch especially sharp, shot his third consecutive 
round of 68 Sunday to win the Freeport-McMoRan Golf Classic by three strokes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was really proud of the way I played this week on this course," said 
Crenshaw, who finished with a total of 15-under-par 273. "I was really glad to 
get through today." 
</P>
<P>
 The victory, the 18th in his 22-year career, earned Crenshaw $216,000. His 
last three top-10 finishes have been victories. 
</P>
<P>
 Jose Maria Olazabal, with birdies on three of the last four holes, sneaked 
into second place after Sam Torrance, who battled Crenshaw all day, bogeyed No. 
17 and double-bogeyed No. 18. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was a killer," Torrance said. "I still felt I had it going into 16." 
</P>
<P>
 Crenshaw and Torrance started the day at 11-under. Crenshaw, despite swirling 
winds, opened his round with birdies on Nos. 1, 2 and 5 to make the turn at 
14-under. 
</P>
<P>
 Olazabal trailed by nine after 14 holes Sunday, alternating birdies and 
bogeys. Then birdies on Nos. 15, 17 and 18 gave him a 69 for the day and second 
place. 
</P>
<P>
 The second-place finish was worth $129,600. Torrance picked up $81,600 for 
third. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was an expensive 18th hole," Torrance said. Figure Skating  
</P>
<P>
 Carla Urbanski Freeman says she will perform despite a fat lip from being 
punched in the face by one of five youths who attacked her husband. 
</P>
<P>
 The skater and her husband, both 33, were treated at Wilmington Hospital in 
Delaware and released, said Lt. Keith Ash. No arrests have been made. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't back out of shows for something like this," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Freeman said she and partner Rocky Marval will perform as scheduled Wednesday 
in Vail, Colo. The two-time national champions placed 10th in pairs at the 1992 
Olympics in Albertville, France. Swimming  
</P>
<P>
 Tom Dolan, a freshman at Michigan, became the sixth swimmer to win four U.S. 
national individual titles in one meet. 
</P>
<P>
 In dominating the U.S. Swimming Championships at Federal Way, Wash., Dolan 
matched the feat set by Mark Spitz, Tracy Caulkins, Shirley Babashoff, Kristine 
Quance and Janet Evans. 
</P>
<P>
 Dolan won the 1,500-meter freestyle in 15 minutes 18.18 seconds to go with 
victories in the 400 individual medley and 400 and 800 freestyles. He set the 
only American record of the meet in winning the 400 IM. Pro Basketball  
</P>
<P>
 Buck Williams, who was forced to take a bigger role in the middle for Portland 
Trail Blazers with an injury to center Chris Dudley early in the season, signed 
a contract extension. 
</P>
<P>
 Terms of the three-year contract, which runs through the 1996-97 season, were 
not disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams is completing his 13th season and fifth with Portland. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams recently became the 30th NBA player to compete in 1,000 games. He is 
one of 17 NBA players with 11,000 rebounds. Auto Racing

 Ricky Craven of Newburgh, Me., took the lead with a daring three-abreast move 
late in the race and won the Sundrop 300 NASCAR Busch Grand National Series 
stock car race at Hickory, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
 Craven, the 1992 rookie of the year on the series, led the final 32 laps on 
the .363-mile track. The Chevrolet driver collected $14,005 for his first 
victory since joining the series on a full-time basis. Miscellany

 Last time they met, Arkansas defeated Duke, 98-88, in a preseason National 
Invitation Tournament game at Madison Square Garden on Nov. 21, 1990. Hill had 
12 points in that game, Lang four off the bench and Clark did not play. 
Arkansas has no holdovers from that squad.

way to 30 victories this season.

BASEBALL / DAILY REPORT; ANGELS; RODGERS HAPPY WITH CATCHERS

 Manager Buck Rodgers was so concerned about the Angels' catching last season 
that he kept three catchers, hoping one would emerge as an everyday starter. It 
never happened, but he has become more comfortable with Greg Myers and Chris 
Turner, who will share the job this season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have more confidence in both of them," Rodgers said Sunday. "I don't think 
it will ever come down to a strict platoon. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now, it's probably 50-50. I may lean 60-40 toward somebody." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 The Angels' starting lineup for opening day against the Minnesota Twins on 
Tuesday at the Metrodome is expected to look like this: 
</P>
<P>
 Chad Curtis, center field; Damion Easley, third base; Tim Salmon, right field; 
Chili Davis, designated hitter; Bo Jackson, left field; Eduardo Perez, first 
base; Myers, catcher; Harold Reynolds, second base; Gary DiSarcina, shortstop; 
Mark Langston, pitcher.

 The Angels trimmed their roster to 25 by assigning relief pitcher Ken 
Patterson to their minor league camp. They also purchased the contracts of 
pitchers John Dopson, Bob Patterson and Bill Sampen, all non-roster invitees to 
spring training. ELLIOTT TEAFORD

Vince Horsman were sent to triple-A Tacoma, and pitcher Kelly Downs, a member

SOCCER / GRAHAME L. JONES; FIFA CHIEF FIGHTS PALACE COUP TO TRY TO HOLD ON TO 
OFFICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 He is autocratic. He is boastful. He is cunning. 
</P>
<P>
 But what Joao Havelange, the 78-year-old Brazilian who has ruled international 
soccer for the past 20 years, also might be is unbeatable. 
</P>
<P>
 For the past few weeks, an intense, behind-the-scenes struggle has been going 
on within soccer's corridors of power in Zurich, Switzerland, to see whether 
Havelange could either be tempted to step down or tossed out as president of 
FIFA, international soccer's governing body. 
</P>
<P>
 But Havelange seems to have found a way to have the last laugh. Call it 
bribery, if you will. Havelange's detractors certainly will. 
</P>
<P>
 By promising a third team in the 1998 World Cup in France to both Asia and 
CONCACAF (the North and Central American and Caribbean confederation), 
Havelange just might have swayed enough votes to win reelection to a sixth 
four-year term when FIFA's 167 member nations cast their ballots in Chicago in 
June. 
</P>
<P>
 But not many of those votes are likely to come from Europe, which would lose 
two of its World Cup places if Havelange delivers on his promise. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday in Zurich, Havelange will meet with leaders from each of the five 
confederations that make up FIFA. He will seek their support in his bid for a 
final term.  
</P>
<P>
 With Asia and CONCACAF already in his corner and Africa leaning that way, the 
Brazilian would appear to have a lock on the election. South America, 
certainly, is unlikely to oppose him. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Europeans are another matter. If UEFA (the European Football Union) 
decides to put up a candidate to challenge Havelange, and then starts a 
campaign to discredit him, the next two months could see all sorts of 
fireworks. 
</P>
<P>
 As for long-term impact, what happens in the election in Chicago on June 16 is 
likely to have far greater importance than what happens in Pasadena on July 17 
during the World Cup championship game. 
</P>
<P>
 The winner at the Rose Bowl will be world champion for four years. A new, much 
younger FIFA president, however, could control and shape the sport for decades. 
</P>

 Graham Taylor, the luckless coach who presided over England's humiliating 2-0 
loss to the United States last summer and its subsequent failure to qualify for 
the World Cup, has landed on his feet. 
</P>
<P>
 "Turnip" Taylor, as he is known by Britain's tabloid press, was fired as 
England coach in November but last week was named coach of Wolverhampton 
Wanderers, one of England's oldest and most illustrious clubs. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wolves, who are down on their luck at the moment, were founded in 1877 and 
were original members of the English League. The three-time league champions 
and four-time F.A. Cup winners will be familiar, perhaps, to some Los 
Angeles-area fans. 
</P>
<P>
 As the Los Angeles Wolves, playing for Jack Kent Cooke in the summer of 1967, 
the club captured the United Soccer Assn. title in the United States, winning a 
dramatic championship match at the Coliseum, 6-5, over the Washington Whips, 
represented by Aberdeen of Scotland. 
</P>
<P>
 Also working for Cooke at that time was a young lawyer named Alan Rothenberg, 
now U.S. Soccer Federation president, chairman of World Cup USA 1994 and the 
man who hired the coach who built the U.S. team that defeated England last 
summer and cost Taylor his job. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Just before Germany played Italy a couple of weeks ago in Stuttgart, German 
Coach Berti Vogts fired the first salvo in the psychological battle that goes 
on between World Cup rivals. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is good for the Italians to get used to losing to us," Vogts said, no 
doubt thinking ahead to a possible meeting in the summer tournament.  
</P>
<P>
 If both teams perform as expected in the United States, they will meet in the 
quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
 For the record, the Germans won in Stuttgart, 2-1. 
</P>

<P>
 For almost a dozen years, soccer fans worldwide have believed that Bryan 
Robson's 1982 goal for England against France after only 27 seconds was the 
fastest in World Cup history. 
</P>
<P>
 Not so, it appears. 
</P>
<P>
 Research has determined that the fastest goal was, in fact, scored by Vaclav 
Masek of Czechoslovakia after 15 seconds of his country's match against Mexico 
at Vine del Mar in Chile in 1962.

 Atletico Madrid is one of Spain's most famous teams, founded in 1901 and 
boasting a glittering trophy room that contains more than a dozen league and 
cup championship trophies. 
</P>
<P>
 Not to mention the heads of innumerable coaches. 
</P>
<P>
 Atletico's unpredictable and exceptionally short-fused owner, Jesus Gil, has 
set a record of sorts for firing coaches at the drop of a hat, but this season 
he has outdone himself. 
</P>
<P>
 Gil has axed no fewer than four coaches since August, bringing to 14 the 
number he has let go in the last seven years. According to those who keep track 
of such comings and goings, no Spanish club has ever played under five coaches 
in a single season. 
</P>
<P>
 Atletico is now on No. 5 and counting.

 When lowly Celta upset Real Madrid, 3-2, in a Spanish League match on 
Saturday, it did so in odd, if not unique, fashion. 
</P>
<P>
 Celta's goals, which came in a 20-minute span on either side of halftime, were 
scored by Milorad Ratkovic, Stjepan Andrijasevic and Vladimir Gudelj. 
</P>
<P>
 Ratkovic is from Serbia, Andrijasevic is from Croatia and Gudelj is from 
Bosnia.

 The African Championship, currently being played in Tunisia, has produced a 
most unlikely semifinalist. 
</P>
<P>
 Mali, which has never been a force in African soccer, let alone world soccer, 
reached the final four by defeating favored Egypt in the quarterfinals 
Saturday. Earlier, Mali had beaten host Tunisia in the tournament's opening 
match, a result that cost the Tunisian coach his job. 
</P>
<P>
 Mali next plays Zambia in the semifinals on Wednesday. The other semifinal 
pits 1994 World Cup qualifier Nigeria against the Ivory Coast, the defending 
African champion.

 One of the many top strikers the United States will have to contain if it is 
to have any chance in World Cup '94 is Switzerland's Stephane Chapuisat. 
</P>
<P>
 And the news is not good. Chapuisat is rounding into top form. On Saturday, 
playing for Borussia Dortmund against defending German champion Werder Bremen, 
Chapuisat scored a hat trick in 15 minutes to move into first place in the 
Bundesliga scoring charts.

 After being trounced, 7-1, by the United States earlier this year, the Cayman

Cuba's national team goalkeeper.

WORLD SPORTS SCENE / RANDY HARVEY; FRENCH TRACK STAR HIDES OUT IN WESTWOOD

 It did not take long for John Smith to replace one Olympic gold medalist with 
another on the track at Westwood. Quincy Watts, the men's 400-meter champion 
from 1992, is out. Marie-Jose Perec, the women's 400-meter champion from 1992, 
is in. 
</P>
<P>
 Perec, expected to begin working out with Smith this week, told French 
newspapers that she came to Southern California for the sun, but it is just as 
likely she is attempting to escape the heat in France. 
</P>
<P>
 France's only track and field medalist at Barcelona, she could outrun everyone 
in the country except the media. When her agent, Tom Sturak of Topanga Canyon, 
told her that Carl Lewis could walk down the street in Westwood without being 
recognized by more than one of every 10 persons he passed, she did not consider 
that a negative. 
</P>
<P>
 It is possible that Perec could open her outdoor season in the April 17 Mt. 
San Antonio College Relays at Walnut. 
</P>
<P>
 Watts, meantime, left Smith for Bob Kersee and is working out at various San 
Fernando Valley locations near his home in Calabasas.

 Encouraging news for track and field's May 22 New York Games is that CBS will 
offer same-day coverage. Discouraging news is that the meet lost a major 
sponsor last week and has been forced to cut back to 10 official events, the 
minimum required to qualify as part of the Mobil Grand Prix circuit. 
</P>
<P>
 That is not likely to win the meet any points with the International Amateur 
Athletic Federation, which, taking everything into consideration from hotel 
accommodations and food for athletes to the quality of the competition, ranked 
the New York Games 12th among 16 Grand Prix meets last summer. The only other 
Grand Prix meet in the United States, the Bruce Jenner Invitational at San 
Jose, ranked last.

 Franziska van Almsick, 15, is the first swimmer from eastern Germany in two 
decades to emerge as an international star who was not a product of her former 
country's sports machine. 
</P>
<P>
 Her mother is a former East German sports official who did not apologize last 
year when she confessed that she spied on athletes for the country's secret 
police, but the young van Almsick developed after the fall of the Berlin Wall 
and has not been tainted by politics. 
</P>
<P>
 After winning six gold medals and a silver in the 1993 European Championships, 
she was named Swimming World's Female Swimmer of the Year. But she said she was 
more honored when she was voted Germany's most popular woman athlete in a poll 
taken among teen-age girls by a national sports magazine. Steffi Graf finished 
second. 
</P>
<P>
 During a ceremony last Thursday night at Los Angeles' Amateur Athletic 
Foundation, where she received the World Trophy as the best athlete from 
Europe, van Almsick apologized for her limited knowledge of English. "The first 
foreign language we learned in East Berlin was Russian," she said.

 An automatic five-tenths deduction to the U.S. Figure Skating Assn.: Two weeks 
after Brian Boitano informed USFSA officials that he was withdrawing from the

competitors. If Boitano appears, it will be only to perform an exhibition 
routine.

 Before last month's World Championships, Japan's Yuka Sato said that it would 
be difficult for her to get a break from the judges because figure skating is 
"still a white person's sport." 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately, she knows more about skating than she does about her sport's 
recent history. Women's world champions in the last nine years include 
African-American Debi Thomas in 1986, Japanese Midori Ito in '89, 
Asian-American Kristi Yamaguchi in '91 and '92 and now Sato. 
</P>
<P>
 The temper tantrum France's Surya Bonaly threw after finishing second to Sato 
was not her first. After seeing her scores in the 1990 World Championships, she 
cupped her hands around her mouth and booed the judges.

 Shaquille O'Neal's appearance as a member of Dream Team II in this summer's 
World Championships at Toronto will be the second time he has participated in a 
USA Basketball event. In the 1990 U.S. Olympic Festival, he averaged 24.5 
points, 13.8 rebounds, 6.8 blocks and set 14 Festival records. 
</P>
<P>
 While Dream Team II players take a break after the NBA season, other teams 
will be preparing for the World Championships in the July 23-Aug. 7 Goodwill 
Games at St. Petersburg, Russia, where the U.S. team consist of collegians. If 
Purdue's Glenn Robinson does not turn pro, he no doubt will be U.S. Coach 
George Raveling's first choice for the team that will be named next month.

WOMEN MOURN DEATHS OF THEIR MATES NEAR PIER; CRIME: THE GIRLFRIENDS OF TWO SHOT 
IN THE HEAD ON HUNTINGTON BEACH STREET FIND IT DIFFICULT TO MAKE SENSE OF THE

 Robbie Sanchez and Kari Olson tenderly laid flowers Sunday on the sidewalk 
near where their boyfriends were gunned down last week. And they struggled to 
make sense of what happened. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very difficult and it hurts a lot for someone you love to be ripped away 
so quickly and senselessly," said Olson, 19, an exotic dancer who lived with 
her boyfriend, Chen Cosmo Maui Blanchard. 
</P>
<P>
 Blanchard, 23, and Kenny Paul Sommer, 23, both of Huntington Beach, were shot 
to death Thursday after leaving a pizza parlor at the corner of Main Street and 
Orange Avenue, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said a long-haired man with a goatee approached the two men and calmly 
shot them in the head at close range before fleeing on foot. A confrontation in 
a bar might have led to the attack, police said. No suspects have been 
arrested. 
</P>
<P>
 As the investigation continues, Olson and Sanchez are trying to find meaning 
in their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was everything to me," Sanchez said, sitting in a barren living room at 
the couple's two-story apartment here. Outside in the driveway, her father and 
younger brother were loading boxes and furniture into a pickup truck. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't stay here because it hurts too much. I can still feel him and smell 
him here," said Sanchez, 25, a hair stylist who was engaged to Sommer, a snake 
breeder. They had known each other for nearly six years. 
</P>
<P>
 Looking at a diamond ring on her left hand, Sanchez said they planned to be 
married in June, and then move to Oregon, somewhere to start a "Brady Bunch" 
family and escape the increasing violence in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wish we had moved sooner," Sanchez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Olson said she plans to remain in the apartment she shared with Blanchard. An 
unemployed auto mechanic, Blanchard was a loving man who spent as much time as 
possible with his 3-year-old son from a previous relationship, Olson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Olson said Blanchard always urged her to stay in school at Orange Coast 
College and pursue her dream of becoming a zoologist. 
</P>
<P>
 "For him, I have to keep going, even though it's extremely painful. He'd be 
upset if I just quit," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Olson and Sanchez denied their boyfriends had belonged to gangs -- a 
possibility raised by police -- although both men had shaved their heads and 
wore tattoos. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's so painful," Olson said. "People are judging the exterior and don't take 
time to understand the interior."

PUTTING BRIGHT FACE ON EASTER FOR KIDS AWAY FROM HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 It began like Easter morning in a million other homes. There were baskets of 
candy, Easter egg hunts, young girls in frilly dresses and a big-eyed, 
2-year-old boy in a snappy sports coat. 
</P>
<P>
 But this wasn't a typical home. This was Orangewood Children's Home, where 185 
youngsters, as young as 2 days and as old as 17 years, had to celebrate the 
holiday apart from family and loved ones. 
</P>
<P>
 Orangewood, which accepts as many as 3,000 children a year, is where Orange 
County authorities place abused and neglected youngsters for their own 
protection. 
</P>
<P>
 "These kids are pretty much detached," Tim Hu said as he prepared hamburgers 
on a grill in the commons area at Orangewood. "We want to make sure they have 
some pleasant memories." 
</P>
<P>
 Hu and Carlos Olivares, final-year students at Western State University 
College of Law in Irvine, organized Sunday's Easter festival. 
</P>
<P>
 The two law students held a toy drive for Orangewood children last Christmas 
and decided that their law school should become involved as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's always a knock on lawyers. There are always lawyer jokes," said 
Olivares, 37-year-old father of four. But it took little persuasion for campus 
groups, students, faculty and the school administration to respond to the call, 
donating money and showing up Sunday to visit with the children, hide eggs and 
grill hamburgers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We hope to start a tradition at the school where every year Western State 
sort of adopts Orangewood" youngsters at Easter, Olivares said. 
</P>
<P>
 The children seemed to appreciate the effort. They took turns romping in an 
inflated rubber playroom, searching for hidden Easter goodies, munching 
barbecued lunches and delighting to a roaming clown and magic show -- thanks to 
the generosity of Western State benefactors and donations from local 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Licking the barbecue sauce from her fingers, a 12-year-old girl talked about 
life away from her family. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'd always have Easter egg hunts," recalled the freckle-faced child, who 
over the past year has lived in, besides Orangewood, a group home, another 
public facility and also with a relative. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want my kids going through the same heartaches I'm going through," 
said the girl, whose name is being withheld to protect her privacy.  
</P>
<P>
 By mere appearances, it was impossible to distinguish this crowd of 
bright-faced toddlers and teens from any group of more fortunate children. 
</P>
<P>
 There are few tears shed by the youngsters at Orangewood, according to Rick 
Bazant, community program specialist. Despite their ages, or maybe because of 
it, the children seem remarkably resilient, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, days like Sunday put their emotions to the test. 
</P>
<P>
 "During the holidays is when these kids really need this one-on-one 
attention," Bazant said. 
</P>
<P>
 Being apart from their parents is an emotional toll for children of any age. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they don't want to talk to the father who was involved in a molestation, 
they don't have to," Bazant explained. "But you get the other end of the 
spectrum too. . . . They still want to go home with mom even though mom may 
have known what was going on and mom wasn't protecting them. It wasn't mom's 
fault, in the eyes of the children." 
</P>
<P>
 In the toddlers' wing of Orangewood, some of the 33 Western State volunteers 
visited with 1- and 2-year-olds as they finished lunch at miniature wooden 
tables. 
</P>
<P>
 Ethelyn Bernstein, a Western State receptionist and mother of two grown 
children, helped a 23-month-old, brown-eyed boy remove his sports coat, then 
watched as he devoured his hamburger and fries. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are adorable children," Bernstein said. "It's just sad they have to go 
through this."

RESULTS OF CRIME OFFENSIVE COULD TAKE 2 YEARS; VIOLENCE: COUNTY GANG KILLINGS 
CONTINUE AT A DEADLY PACE. A FALL SUMMIT PLANTED SEEDS FOR A BATTLE THAT IS 
JUST NOW BEGINNING TO TAKE ROOT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Only three months into the new year, the number of gang-related killings in 
Orange County is on a pace to equal or break last year's record body count of 
74, and officials are predicting that it could take two years before newly 
approved law enforcement strategies are able to make a difference in the 
continuing violence. 
</P>
<P>
 The news comes just days after local government officials were applauded at 
the Hall of Administration for their roles in last November's first gang 
violence summit. 
</P>
<P>
 Out on the streets, however, the killing continues. 
</P>
<P>
 While there has been no single incident to match last year's gruesome slaying 
of a 17-year-old San Clemente youth who was speared through the head with a 
paint roller, the county's chief gang prosecutor, Doug Woodsmall, said the 
"numbers still keep rolling in." 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think anybody really expected that this situation was going to go 
away overnight. The problem is of such magnitude that it is going to take time. 
(To see a change), it could be at least a year, probably two years." 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 42 total homicides this year in Orange County, officials say they have 
linked 11 to gang-related killings in Santa Ana alone. Woodsmall, however, said 
that number represents an incomplete tally of gang killings for the first 
quarter of 1994 and is expected to rise in short order pending the 
investigation of other unsolved slayings throughout the county. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, law enforcement officials have identified 15 more local gang 
organizations, bringing the total number in Orange County to at least 300. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a growth going on," said Lon Erickson, a senior district attorney's 
investigator whose office is in the midst of reconstructing a color-coded map 
showing the territories claimed by local gangs. 
</P>
<P>
 For law enforcement officers, the map provides a dramatic view of the 
proliferation of gangs in Orange County as virtually no area is free of their 
presence. 
</P>
<P>
 Erickson said the majority of the new gangs are graffiti "tagging crews" whose 
violent actions and use of weapons have elevated them to full-fledged gang 
status. The others include new splinter groups of existing gangs or roving 
bands of Asian gangs, which traditionally do not claim specific geographic 
bases. 
</P>
<P>
 "The firearms are more prolific, the deaths are occurring. Things are 
happening all the way across the board," Erickson said. "We're just doing the 
best job we can." 
</P>
<P>
 The public outcry over gang violence in Orange County probably reached an apex 
at last November's summit when about 1,000 people -- students, families, police 
officers, government leaders and gang members themselves -- issued a collective 
call for help in the local gang wars. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, residents and county officials were just beginning to absorb a 
dramatic upswing in violent gang incidents, the most notorious being the death 
of Steve Woods, the San Clemente youth who was speared through the head with a 
paint roller. 
</P>
<P>
 The death was one of 74 gang-related killings recorded last year, up from 43 
in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, seeds for what officials hope will be a strong offensive have been 
planted and are just now beginning to take root. 
</P>
<P>
 A large part of the county's offensive rests with a $2-million program in 
which teams of prosecutors and probation officers will be dispatched to 
gang-troubled neighborhoods in six areas -- Anaheim, Costa Mesa, Garden Grove, 
Orange, Santa Ana and South County. There, they will be teamed with local 
police to build criminal cases against the most hardened gang leaders in those 
communities. 
</P>
<P>
 One of two teams slated for Santa Ana has been in operation since January. 
This month, the cities of Anaheim and Orange are expected to begin their 
programs and all are expected to be in place by June. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff Brad Gates, who was criticized late last year for indicating that he 
would not be participating in the program, now is also expected to join in the 
countywide strategy, law enforcement officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gates could not be reached for comment Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The anti-gang project is an extension of the highly successful program in the 
city of Westminster known as TARGET (Tri-Agency Resources Gang Enforcement 
Team). In the coming days, Westminster Police Chief James Cook is expected to 
release a new study showing a continuing decline in gang violence in the city 
since the program's inception two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "If anything, (the continuing violence countywide) justifies the importance of 
remaining true to the goals we established at the summit," said Supervisor 
Harriett M. Wieder, who organized the November meeting. The countywide TARGET 
program was announced weeks after the summit meeting and officials have pledged 
to continue sharing new strategies in regular meetings of the Orange County 
Gang Prevention Alliance. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, Wieder called together organizers and sponsors of the summit meeting 
at the Hall of Administration to recognize them for their participation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm hoping for a significant turnaround within a year," Wieder said. "We've 
got to show some muscle. But I think there is a recognition that this community 
won't stand for (gang violence). We don't need to study the problem any more. 
We've got to do something." 
</P>
<P>
 The increase in the number of gangs was of particular concern, Wieder said, 
but she attributed the trend, in part, to more sophisticated tracking methods 
used by law enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
 "These gangs just didn't spring up like crocuses," the supervisor said. "It 
sounds to me like we're doing more to identify some that have always been here. 
The migration of gangs from Los Angeles to Orange County is another concern." 
</P>
<P>
 Dist. Atty. Michael R. Capizzi agreed it could be some time before officials 
are able to get a "proper measure" of the effect the TARGET teams could have 
throughout the county. 
</P>
<P>
 "Public outrage is an important ingredient in galvanizing support for these 
programs," Capizzi said. "I don't think we've lost that." TRACKING GANG 
KILLINGS 
</P>
<P>
 County prosecutors tally gang-related killings by periodically reviewing crime 
statistics from all 31 Orange County cities. In those cities, police identify 
gang killings as any incident in which suspected gang members are involved 
directly or as accomplices.

GROCER FLEES THREATS A DAY AFTER SHOOTING; VIOLENCE: AS OFFICIALS TRY TO REDUCE 
TENSIONS, REPUTED GANG MEMBERS INTIMIDATE THE MAN WHO WOUNDED A YOUTH SUSPECTED 
OF SHOPLIFTING. 
</P>

<P>
 Lynwood officials and community leaders worked Sunday to defuse racial 
tensions sparked by a Korean American grocer's shooting a day earlier of a 
14-year-old Latino suspected of shoplifting a bag of cookies. 
</P>
<P>
 But the grocer wound up padlocking his market after reputed gang members 
threatened him with retaliation -- right in front of a city councilman who was 
visiting the mom-and-pop store. 
</P>
<P>
 A frightened Michael Kim, owner of Charlie's Market, fled the business with 
his wife early Sunday afternoon. "Somebody threatens . . . I'm going to close," 
he said before pulling a metal grating across the front of the market on busy 
Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials in the Southeast Los Angeles County city worried that the Saturday 
shooting -- which left the 14-year-old in critical condition with a chest wound 
-- might mark a new chapter in troubled relations between Korean American 
grocers and the often poor, minority communities they serve. 
</P>
<P>
 After the threats by gang members Sunday -- brazenly repeated before reporters 
-- Los Angeles County Sheriff's Lt. William Henderson said deputies would keep 
an eye on Kim's market "as much as we can." 
</P>
<P>
 Lynwood Councilman Armando Rea was in the grocery shortly after noon Sunday, 
discussing the incident with the Kims, when two reputed gang members entered 
and told the couple "they were next in line" and "an accident will happen to 
him or her within the immediate future," Rea said. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the pair made a hand gesture simulating a gun, "obviously threatening 
and intimidating" the store owners, Rea said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's records do not indicate whether the teen-ager shot Saturday was a 
gang member. Authorities said he was among five youths who entered the 
streetside grocery, three purchasing items -- but the others leaving with the 
cookies. 
</P>
<P>
 Kim chased the pair in his car and caught up with them several blocks away on 
Long Beach Boulevard, according to the sheriff's report. 
</P>
<P>
 When he confronted the youths, the grocer told deputies, one drew a knife and 
approached him. The other motioned as if he was pulling something from his 
waistband, Kim said. 
</P>
<P>
 The grocer said he shot the second youth with a .38-caliber handgun and then 
drove him back to the store to call for help. 
</P>
<P>
 The wounded youth, who was reported in critical condition Sunday at Martin 
Luther King Jr./Drew Medical Center, was booked at the hospital on a felony 
charge of strong-armed robbery, Henderson said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the wake of the shooting, Rea and others called for dialogue between Korean 
American merchants and the predominantly Latino and African American residents 
they serve in Lynwood, a city of nearly 62,000 near the intersection of the 
Long Beach and Century freeways. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now is time for cool heads to prevail," said Benjamin Miranda, 
executive director of Concerned Citizens of Lynwood, a community organization, 
who also visited the store Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Miranda faulted the youths for taking the cookies and Kim for "taking the law 
into his own hands," rather than reporting the theft to sheriff's deputies. 
"Both sides were wrong," Miranda said. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident inevitably prompted some to draw parallels -- and distinctions -- 
with the March, 1991, killing of an African American, 15-year-old Latasha 
Harlins by a Korean American grocer in South-Central Los Angeles in a dispute 
over a bottle of orange juice. 
</P>
<P>
 Grocer Soon Ja Du was sentenced to probation after being found guilty of 
voluntary manslaughter in that case, which heightened tensions between African 
Americans and Korean Americans just months before the 1992 riots. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Lynwood shooting, the victim was Latino and authorities have taken no 
action against the 36-year-old Kim, though they seized his revolver and the 
videotape from the store's security camera. An investigation is continuing, 
Henderson said. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the youths in Saturday's incident admitted Sunday that he and his 
friends belong to a gang and that they did steal the cookies. But the youth, 
16, disputed Kim's version of the shooting, including whether the grocer acted 
in self-defense. "My homeboy didn't have no knife," he said, standing in a 
small parking area adjacent to the store. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Rea said the youths' conduct was "totally unacceptable whether 
Hispanic, African American or Anglo. It should not be tolerated." 
</P>
<P>
 He called for efforts to talk to gang members in the city and "put a break to 
this" and "bring some understanding to both sides of the community." 
</P>
<P>
 Rea also called on Korean American store owners to improve relations with the 
community by hiring Latino and black youths. 
</P>
<P>
 There was a steady stream of customers into the store Sunday, some in their 
Easter clothes -- and all aware of the shooting the day before. 
</P>
<P>
 George Lyles, an African American, praised the owners as good people who 
treated him with respect. "You did the right thing," he told Kim. 
</P>
<P>
 Behind the counter, Kim's wife, who did not want to give her first name, said 
the couple bought the market 11 months ago and have tried to treat "all my 
customers like my family." She insisted that her husband had acted in 
self-defense. "They are gangsters. They had a knife," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the encouragement of Lyles and others, she and her husband hastily 
closed the business little more than an hour later, after the threat of 
retaliation by the gang members. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside, the 16-year-old said the grocer had reason to be be fearful. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now, he's a target," the youth said.

NO LONGER LIVING ON AN ISLAND; JAPANESE: THE 40,000 NATIONALS IN THE SOUTHLAND 
HAVE KEPT APART, EVEN FROM JAPANESE AMERICANS. NOW, ECONOMIC WOES HAVE THINNED 
THEIR NUMBERS AND RECENT SAN PEDRO MURDERS HAVE INCREASED THEIR FEAR OF CRIME.

 When parents came to the orientation in Little Tokyo for their children's 
Japanese-language school last week, they were welcomed by a familiar sight -- a 
vertical, seven-foot-tall banner with Japanese calligraphy announcing the 
event, just like the ones in Japan.  
</P>
<P>
 But the speech by Principal Atsushi Yoshioka included topics they could not 
have imagined in Tokyo: Do not let your children wear gang-style clothing to 
school -- it could attract real gang members. And please volunteer to help 
patrol school grounds to keep the children safe from crime. 
</P>
<P>
 The speech was the same one Yoshioka gives each year, but with the shooting 
deaths of two Japanese students on everyone's mind, the parents listened more 
gravely than ever. That tragedy made these parents, like the other 40,000 
Japanese nationals living in Southern California, realize how much a part of 
Los Angeles they have become. 
</P>
<P>
 "Always I have to watch (my children) and hold their hands tight. If I'm 
shopping and they disappear, I'm so scared," Akiko Kenmatsu said at the 
orientation. 
</P>
<P>
 The community of expatriate Japanese citizens includes artists, scientists, 
musicians, journalists, entrepreneurs and dishwashers. Some are here for just a 
few months, others for decades.  
</P>
<P>
 For students like those slain, time here is a rite of passage, an interlude of 
beach-going and leisure before joining corporate life. Southern California is, 
for Japanese, the No. 1 choice for study abroad. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But for the large contingent of business people sent by their companies, 
living in the Los Angeles area is not a choice, but a duty. The area is Japan's 
corporate capital in the United States, with more Japan-based businesses than 
any other metropolitan area. Although the faces of these businesspeople from 
Japan change every three to five years, their community has become a permanent 
part of Southern California, changing the landscape with gleaming corporate 
headquarters, supermarkets and mini-malls catering to their needs -- and, most 
important to Californians, offices and factories that provide jobs to 60,000 
Americans.  
</P>
<P>
 The numbers grew rapidly in the 1980s along with Japan's worldwide economic 
expansion, but have dwindled in the last several years with the Japanese 
economic downturn. They are a largely self-contained community, separate from 
the students and artists. They also rarely mingle with and are occasionally in 
conflict with the community of Americans of Japanese ancestry that has been 
here since the turn of the century. 
</P>
<P>
 As the Japanese expatriate community mushroomed in the 1980s along with 
Japan's wealth, it became more insular, creating a nearly self-sufficient world 
of its own. 
</P>
<P>
 Ken Amano, president of Nippondenso of Los Angeles, notes that when a Japanese 
family arrives in Los Angeles, its members can step into a miniature Japan 
right in Torrance and Palos Verdes, the center of the expatriate community. 
Without speaking a word of English, they can get medical care, travel services, 
auto repairs and just about any Japanese product they could find back home.  
</P>
<P>
 Even when Japanese nationals intend to assimilate into American life, it is 
very easy to give in to the temptation to shop only at Japanese stores, said 
Amano, whose firm manufactures auto parts. 
</P>
<P>
 The Torrance outpost of the Japanese Yaohan supermarket chain is the local PX 
for the community, featuring pickled plums, sea urchin, burdock root and other 
food staples. An attached mall features Japanese toys, appliances, medicines, 
books, videos, greeting cards and cosmetics. 
</P>
<P>
 There are 650 member companies in the Japanese Business Assn. of Southern 
California, 240 in Torrance alone. In the South Bay plain surrounding the local 
headquarters of Toyota, Honda and Nissan, a rich infrastructure has grown to 
meet the needs of their Japanese executives and families. 
</P>
<P>
 The men enjoy karaoke clubs and hostess bars staffed by Japanese. They spend 
their weekends playing golf with other Japanese, taking advantage of daily 
greens fees that run about $50 here as compared to $500 in Japan. The women 
join Japanese-speaking tennis leagues and choral groups. There are 
Japanese-language schools for the kids. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If this self-contained community sounds typical of many immigrant groups in 
Los Angeles, it's not. These Japanese citizens are not immigrants, and because 
they plan to return home soon, have less incentive to integrate into American 
society. They are more like the tight-knit community of American businessmen 
stationed in Tokyo than the Asian immigrants in Chinatown and Koreatown. 
</P>
<P>
 The community of businessmen and students from Japan is also distinct from the 
long-established Japanese American community, which numbers about 120,000 in 
Southern California. Most working-age Japanese Americans cannot speak Japanese 
and know little about Japanese culture. Their grandparents generally immigrated 
as farm and railroad laborers at the turn of the century from the impoverished 
Japanese countryside.  
</P>
<P>
 Today, by contrast, Japanese businessmen sent over by their corporations are 
well-educated urbanites, and some Japanese Americans feel they are looked down 
on by the expatriates. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some Japanese nationals see Japanese Americans as below themselves, as the 
offspring of those who couldn't make it in Japan," said George Nakano, a 
Torrance city councilman. 
</P>
<P>
 Another problem for Japanese Americans is that many people do not distinguish 
between them and Japanese nationals. So when Japanese corporations or 
politicians create frictions with Americans, Japanese Americans find themselves 
taking heat for something they have nothing to do with. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, some Japanese Americans welcome the chance to learn about their 
grandparents' culture from the Japanese visitors, taking lessons in flower 
arranging or calligraphy. And some Japanese nationals say they appreciate that 
the earlier immigrants helped pave the way for their own acceptance. 
</P>
<P>
 Japanese nationals admit they tend to be insular. "Almost all Japanese wives 
like to stay in the Japanese community, not speaking English, and eating 
Japanese food," said Ryuko Sakai, who has lived here two years and has help 
spearhead efforts to reach out to Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 But she says that most families are drawn into American society because their 
children are in public schools, and some make a real effort to contribute to 
American society. Last year, the women's committee of the Japanese Business 
Assn. raised $64,000 for Los Angeles schools, hospitals, disabled groups and 
Japanese American causes. Japanese women perform choral music at nursing homes, 
volunteer at public schools and participate in Neighborhood Watch groups.  
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, Japanese corporations are making an effort to be good corporate 
citizens. Members of the Japanese Business Assn. donated $3 million to the Red 
Cross and other organizations after the Northridge quake and $175,000 to 
schools. After the Los Angeles riots, Toyota set up an auto repair training 
program in the Crenshaw district, and Pioneer Electronics began a job-training 
center for high school students in Watts. In Torrance, Councilman Nakano said, 
Japanese companies provided major funding for a new city cultural center. 
</P>
<P>
 But despite such efforts, the families of most business people from Japan 
remain largely ensconced in their own world. To some extent, they are insulated 
from the harsher side of life in Los Angeles by their relatively affluent 
lifestyle in places such as San Marino, Irvine and Palos Verdes. While many 
Japanese business people live a middle-class existence in Torrance or Pasadena, 
senior executives enjoy the same posh neighborhoods as their American 
counterparts. 
</P>
<P>
 Sakai lives in a spacious house in Palos Verdes Estates overlooking the 
Pacific, provided by Toyota Motor Sales of America -- her husband is its 
president. Guests are welcomed, Japanese-style, with an invitation to switch 
their shoes for slippers in the marble foyer. The home is decorated with 
elegant contemporary furniture and modern woodblock prints of Henry Thoreau and 
Walden Pond.  
</P>
<P>
 Yet Sakai and her friends, chatting in the sunny living room, know that living 
in Palos Verdes does not protect them from the problems of Los Angeles. It was 
just a few miles away in San Pedro that two Japanese students were slain in a 
carjacking. Masako Yoshida's son was offered drugs at Peninsula High School. 
And Iyoko Kawamura says that her son's Honda was stolen from Hermosa Beach and 
stripped. 
</P>
<P>
 "In Japan, even if the opera is over at midnight, teen-agers can come home on 
the subway," Sakai said. Here in Los Angeles, she and her husband never stay 
for curtain calls at the Music Center in Downtown Los Angeles because they do 
not like being on the freeway late at night. Many Japanese nationals even avoid 
Little Tokyo because they consider it dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
 After the student slayings, Yoshida's husband bought her a cellular phone. "In 
Japan safety is free," Yoshida said. "Here we spend a lot of money to keep 
safe." 
</P>
<P>
 Many families turn inward, toward their own community, because they believe 
that succeeding in the Japanese educational system -- which requires remaining 
Japanese in behavior -- is the key to the future security of their children. So 
while most children attend American public schools, they also attend one of 
five Southern California branches of the Japanese-government-funded Asahi 
Gakuen school on Saturdays. 
</P>
<P>
 The textbooks are identical to those used in Japan, and in any week the pupils 
will be on exactly the same chapter as students in Japan.  
</P>
<P>
 Before children enter sixth grade, many mothers take them back to Japan so 
they can begin to prepare for crucial exams to enter good high schools, the 
first step toward getting into a good college. The fathers stay in Los Angeles. 
Such separations are common in Japanese corporate life, where employees do not 
generally have the right to choose or refuse assignments. 
</P>
<P>
 But despite the hardships of adjusting to life in a strange and sometimes 
dangerous country, many families from Japan come to love America. 
</P>
<P>
 The women enjoy the greater chance to speak their minds, and the freedom from 
the burdensome web of social obligations in Japan. Many children prefer 
American schools to the "examination hell" of the Japanese educational system. 
And many fathers enjoy the chance to spend more time with their families here 
than in work-centered Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 "The feeling here is very comfortable for me," said Yoshida, whose daughter is 
studying to be a veterinarian in Missouri. "I would like to stay." 
</P>
<P>
 Some women and children stay behind in the United States when their husbands 
are called back to Japan. Other families even immigrate to the United States 
when they get the chance. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, though, whether Japanese business people and their families feel 
safe and happy here has more than just anthropological interest -- it could 
have a serious impact on the Southern California economy. Many Japanese 
companies have reduced their presence in Southern California because of the 
economic downturn in Japan. The Japan Business Assn.'s roster dropped 10% last 
year. Crime problems are just one more reason to leave. 
</P>
<P>
 Amano, the head of Nippondenso, said security problems have made many Japanese 
companies move from Los Angeles County to the Irvine area. Amano points to a 
seven-foot iron fence he had to install around the parking lot in his Long 
Beach industrial park because of car thefts. He said he was deeply shaken by 
the death of an American employee's 14-year-old daughter in a drive-by shooting 
nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Amano said he would like to purchase the lot next door and expand his 
business, which employs 350 people here, because the price of the land has 
dropped sharply with the slumping real estate market. But he is not going to, 
not yet. "I'd like to stay here," he said, but may move the whole operation if 
the crime situation continues to deteriorate.  
</P>
<P>
 Amano said he was discouraged by the pessimism of many Americans when he 
served on a committee of Rebuild L.A. "If this were Japan, we could not abandon 
somewhere that goes bad (because the country is small and must use every inch 
of space)," he says. "We have to rebuild. 
</P>
<P>
 "But it seems that rebuilding activities lose momentum quickly (in America) 
because you have the freedom to find a safer place to live by moving farther 
away. It's a sad story."

STREET SMART: THE ROADBLOCKS OF RACING TO EMERGENCIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HENRY CHU 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 According to ancient Greek myth, the music of sirens caused sailors to go mad 
with desire and wreck their ships on rocky shores. 
</P>
<P>
 In the modern American version of the tale, the wail of sirens emanates from 
emergency vehicles, not creatures that are half-woman, half-bird. But the 
results can be just as chaotic -- especially for the emergency personnel 
rushing to the scene of an accident, fire or crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Anxious motorists freeze up and block traffic. Curious pedestrians step into 
the road. And particularly brazen drivers sometimes end up crashing into other 
vehicles -- including the very ambulances, fire engines and squad cars 
answering the call for help. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's extremely stressful because you have to have 110% of your focus and 
attention on everything around you, and an accident can happen in a split 
second," said Los Angeles City Fire Capt. Jack Fry. "It's very draining 
mentally and physically to drive 'emergency.' " 
</P>
<P>
 As head of the paramedics bureau for southern Los Angeles, Fry zooms out every 
day to numerous incidents, his siren blaring, his lights whirling. He has 
notched his share of roadway headaches, even an accident or two caused by 
inattentive motorists. Such as the time he was hit by a "gutter runner" -- 
someone trying to slip by the emergency crew by hugging the curb. 
</P>
<P>
 "Driving one of these emergency (vehicles) for 14 years," he said, "it's bound 
to happen." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In a perfect world, drivers pull over to the right when an emergency vehicle 
approaches, clearing a path down the middle, as spelled out in California 
Vehicle Code Section 21806. 
</P>
<P>
 But the real world is not perfect. 
</P>
<P>
 "People will try and race us," said paramedic Ruthie Rush of Station 46, which 
sits at Hoover Street and Vernon Avenue in South-Central Los Angeles. "Or 
someone will be standing on the side of the street, and all of a sudden they'll 
dash out in the street like they're playing chicken with us." 
</P>
<P>
 Often motorists, their stereos booming, do not even hear the sirens. Others 
react like a deer in headlights, coming to a dead stop in the middle of the 
road and casting uncomprehending glances at impatient ambulance crews as if 
they are from a different country, said Rush's partner, Dave French. "They're 
just ignorant rather than deliberately doing something wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest hazard is cross-traffic. The great majority of the roughly 150 
accidents involving emergency vehicles each year in Los Angeles occur at 
intersections, city fire officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 Firetruck and ambulance drivers are instructed to stop at all red lights and 
stop signs, even though legally they are exempt from most traffic regulations 
when going "Code 3" (emergency mode). Rescue workers are also told not to 
exceed the posted speed limit by more than 15 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
 A recent ride with Fry in his Ford Crown Victoria proved the wisdom of these 
rules. 
</P>
<P>
 "Incident 784," crackled the scanner about 9:30 one night. "Shooting in 
progress." A 20-year-old man was reported wounded in the 1600 block of West 
59th Street. 
</P>
<P>
 In a flash, Fry was out of the garage of Station 46, going Code 3 south on 
Hoover. At Slauson Avenue, he stopped: Even with his sirens and lights on -- 
made more noticeable by the evening darkness -- cross-traffic continued to 
hurtle through the intersection. 
</P>
<P>
 Along Slauson, motorists for the most part yielded the right of way, but some 
braked in the middle of the street. Fry and the shrieking ambulance barely 
missed a beat but had to slow down slightly as they looped around the mess. 
</P>
<P>
 "When one car does wrong, the others follow suit," Fry sighed. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, he and the paramedic team were able to arrive at the scene -- a 
two-mile drive from the station -- within five minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 That is close to the average response time departmentwide, which is 5.8 
minutes to a fire or medical emergency. And in the business of saving homes or 
lives, "seconds do matter," Fry said. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of that, paramedics familiarize themselves with back routes and 
less-traveled roads to maximize their time. Rush and French of Station 46 know 
the secrets: Broadway is a good north-south alternative. Ditto Avalon 
Boulevard. And, of course, avoid the Harbor Freeway and Figueroa Street during 
rush hour. 
</P>
<P>
 The Harbor can be especially vexing because of major construction under way 
and the closure of several on- and off-ramps. Rush and French tried it anyway 
one day but quickly exited to escape the gridlock. They promptly found 
themselves in a long queue of cars on the off-ramp. 
</P>
<P>
 The clock was ticking. So, French said with a grin, he simply steered the 
ambulance down the dirt embankment and barreled right through a construction 
area. "Hang on!" he shouted. "We're going four-wheel drive!" 
</P>
<P>
 It was not something he learned from the two-inch-thick black binder at the 
station labeled "Driver's Training Manual." Navigating an embankment also is 
not part of the obstacle course, or driving "rodeo" (which paramedics pronounce 
roh-DAY-oh), that ambulance and fire engine drivers negotiate once a year for 
practice and evaluation. 
</P>
<P>
 But when someone needs help, French has to find a way to get there. As long as 
it is fairly safe. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I'm going to cause an accident, then I'm not going to do that person any 
good," he said. "But we've gone up on sidewalks if that's the only way."

QUAKE-AFFLICTED COMMUNITY STILL ROUGHING IT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE TAMAKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Since the Northridge earthquake, life at a Newhall mobile home park has 
resembled a wilderness camp-out, and after more than two months of roughing it, 
residents are getting pretty sick and tired of their new lifestyles. 
</P>
<P>
 They have been drinking water from bottles, using outdoor portable toilets and 
hiking down dirt roads to take showers. Their days are filled with noise and 
dust stirred up by heavy equipment working on repairs to the nearby Golden 
State Freeway. Their nights are noisy and just plain cold. 
</P>
<P>
 The 40 or so residents still living at the Crescent Valley Mobile Home Park, 
off of The Old Road south of Calgrove Avenue, unwillingly embarked on their new 
wilderness lifestyles after the Jan. 17 quake knocked out gas, water and sewage 
services to their park, causing nearly 100 other tenants to move out. 
</P>
<P>
 Word last week that repairs to the heavily damaged sewer system have been 
delayed because of problems with the park's insurance company came as another 
blow to the weary residents. 
</P>
<P>
 The earliest that the 87-unit park is now expected to have all services 
restored is June 1, which prompted some residents to call on state and federal 
officials for help to speed up the process. 
</P>
<P>
 "The rest of the world is back to normal," said resident Skip Cannon. 
"Meanwhile, we have to haul our water in. We don't have heat, and we have to 
shower outside." 
</P>
<P>
 Cannon's neighbor, Lee Irish, said her life in recent weeks has been like 
someone who is stuck on an endless camping trip or somewhere worse. 
</P>
<P>
 "I live in hell's kitchen," she said. "We feel like we're really the lost, 
forgotten souls up here." 
</P>
<P>
 Like most other park residents, Irish has no running water and cannot flush 
the toilet or take a shower in her bathroom. She relies on portable toilets and 
showers set up around the park, which sometimes pose their own problems. 
</P>
<P>
 One recent night, Irish said her husband, Richard, cut his hands and knees 
when he fell into a knee-deep trench on his way to take a shower. 
</P>
<P>
 To make matters worse, heating their home with portable electric heaters 
instead of with natural gas has been a financial burden. Irish said their most 
recent electricity bill was $400 -- nearly the amount of the rent on their 
mobile home space. 
</P>
<P>
 The Irishes and other residents also have trouble getting out of the mobile 
home park by automobile because The Old Road has been transformed into a detour 
past the quake-damaged Golden State Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're being held hostage by traffic," Irish said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cannon has it a little better, but not by much. He and two other residents 
convinced their insurance company to provide them with temporary septic tanks, 
which means they can flush toilets and run water down sinks. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, like his neighbors, Cannon said he longs for the day when peace and 
quiet will replace the noise from the heavy equipment that is being used 24 
hours a day to repair the freeway. Most of all, he longs for the day when the 
park is back up and running. 
</P>
<P>
 But Cannon said he realizes from walking around the park that it will be a 
while before that day arrives. Streets must be repaved; mobile homes must be 
hoisted back on to their foundations; and repairs must be made to the homes' 
interiors. 
</P>
<P>
 Cannon said he circulated flyers encouraging his neighbors to write John 
Garamendi, the state insurance commissioner, and U. S. Sens. Barbara Boxer and 
Dianne Feinstein, asking them to intervene with the park's insurance company. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, life at the park is anything but normal. Probably nobody has more 
memories of how the park used to look than park manager Angie Leano. She has 
lived there since it opened nearly 25 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before the earthquake, everybody was just coming and going," Leano said. "We 
had families in here with children, but the quake drove them away." 
</P>
<P>
 Leano said she has been lonely since many tenants fled to wait out repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're anxious to get back," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 One tenant, Marian Toth, said she plans to return. Toth and one couple from 
the park have been staying with friends in Val Verde since the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 The quake jolted Toth's mobile home off its foundation, but she has since had 
it raised. She still must complete floor repairs, which was punctured by jacks 
that supported her home. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel like Dorothy from 'The Wizard of Oz' clicking her heels and saying, 
'There's no place like home,' " Toth said. "I just want to go home."

EASTER'S TENTFUL OF MIRACLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TERESA ANN WILLIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Church tent meetings conjure up images of old-time religion in the Bible Belt 
-- revivals held by itinerant evangelists and rousing Pentecostal healing 
services. 
</P>
<P>
 But as Easter arrived Sunday in the San Fernando Valley, the tent took on new 
meaning to suburban churchgoers displaced from their usual pews by the 
Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 The wind blew gently as the sun and the clouds took turns greeting the 
worshipers at St. James Presbyterian Church in Tarzana, where a green-and-white 
tent that arrived on Saturday served as an outdoor sanctuary. Matching white 
balloons with the words "Christ is Risen Indeed Alleluia!" inscribed in green 
ink decorated the rope that anchored the tent. 
</P>
<P>
 The tent was last used by a congregation in New Jersey whose church had burned 
down. It arrived in Tarzana in the nick of time, brought by a truck driver from 
a congregation in Massachusetts who was making a trip to California. 
</P>
<P>
 The tent was erected with help from homeless and low-income people who 
patronize a soup kitchen run by the church. 
</P>
<P>
 For some, the day brought back memories of their childhood. 
</P>
<P>
 "It kind of reminded me of the old camp meeting days because that's what my 
mama used to do," said Carole Hartman, 40, whose mother was a missionary in a 
small town in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 In Woodland Hills, the First Baptist Church moved back into a reinforced, 
renovated sanctuary Easter morning after using a rented, white tent for most of 
its services after the Jan. 17 temblor. 
</P>
<P>
 About 80 congregants worshiped at the Woodland Hills church, where retirees 
and members who took time off from their jobs worked together to complete 
repairs by Easter. 
</P>
<P>
 During his opening and closing prayers, however, interim pastor the Rev. 
Willis Lucas reminded those assembled of the real significance of the day. 
</P>
<P>
 "While we rejoice in being back in the sanctuary for the first time, we 
understand what is infinitely more important -- that we are here to meet the 
living, risen Christ," Willis said. 
</P>
<P>
 After the service, worshipers viewed a pictorial history of the church's 
reconstruction in the Christian Education Hall which, though structurally 
sound, is still undergoing renovation. 
</P>
<P>
 Congregants viewed the photos in amazement as they progressed from red- to 
green-tag stage. The destruction at the Woodland Hills church was described as 
the most dramatic among 30 American Baptist churches suffering damage in the 
Los Angeles area. 
</P>
<P>
 In Chatsworth, volunteers at the heavily damaged St. John Eudes Catholic 
Church put up a white tent just in time for Holy Week and Easter Masses. 
</P>
<P>
 At two of the four morning masses held Sunday, crowds of congregants reached 
nearly 1,000. Until the tent arrived, the congregation had been crammed into a 
fellowship hall that only held 400 people. 
</P>
<P>
 "Today was like we rose again," pastoral assistant John Kopp said in an 
interview. "Everyone that wanted to come to church could come to church. Today 
was kind of a symbolic resurrection that we did come together again as parish." 
</P>
<P>
 For Kopp, the white, domed tent -- which sat on the church's school soccer 
field and was decorated on the inside with palm trees -- evoked special 
feelings. 
</P>
<P>
 "You feel like you're looking toward heaven. You always look up," Kopp said.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; CONVERSION SUGGESTED FOR 9 VACANT 
SCHOOLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BILLITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The city staff is recommending that nine vacant school sites be converted to a 
variety of civic uses, such as parks and a sports complex, as well as for 
residential and commercial developments. 
</P>
<P>
 The staff recommendations will be presented to the City Council at a study 
session at 5 p.m. today, before the council's regular meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 The land all belongs to the Ocean View School District, which will ultimately 
decide the fate of the properties. Staff from the city and the district have 
been discussing the future of the strategically located land since last fall. 
</P>
<P>
 The city hopes the discussion will lead to mutually acceptable uses for the 
land. 
</P>
<P>
 District Supt. James R. Tarwater praised the cooperative efforts: "In terms of 
collaboration, it's been terrific. I think we're heading in the right 
direction." 
</P>
<P>
 The city staff's recommendations are: 
</P>
<P>
 * Park View School, 16666 Tunstall Lane: Convert the 11 1/2 acres into a 
"community sports and activity complex." 
</P>
<P>
 * Pleasant View School, 16692 Landau Lane: Preserve the 10.9-acre site for 
possible school or park use in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 * Rancho View School, 16940 B St.: Convert 13.7 acres to a commercial 
development site and use the remaining four acres for a maintenance facility. 
</P>
<P>
 * Crest View School, 18052 Lisa Lane: Convert to a 13.8-acre commercial 
development. 
</P>
<P>
 * Glen View School, 6621 Glen Drive: Change 11.8 acres into a residential 
development and add two acres to an existing park. 
</P>
<P>
 * Robinwood School, 5172 McFadden Ave.: Convert 7.1 acres to a residential 
development and add three acres to an existing park. 
</P>
<P>
 * Haven View School, 16081 Waikiki Lane: Create a 12 1/2-acre residential 
development and add two acres to an existing park. 
</P>
<P>
 * Meadow View School, 5702 Clark Drive: Preserve the 13 acres for future 
school and park use. 
</P>
<P>
 * Lark View School, 17200 Pinehurst Lane, is the current site of school 
district offices. If developed in the future, the city staff recommends adding 
two acres of the site to an existing park. BILL BILLITER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ORANGE; BIRDS FIND HOMES BUILT BY COUPLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN MILLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With four kids, Cody and Teri Maresh already have a full house. But they are 
making room for at least two more families on their modest-sized lot in Orange. 
</P>
<P>
 Cody Maresh has almost finished building a log-cabin duplex with a rock 
chimney for the new occupants -- probably sparrows, but they might be finches. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the couple have been building and decorating wooden birdhouses for 
about 10 years, the hobby has been especially gratifying, even therapeutic, for 
Cody Maresh since he suffered a major back injury working as a construction 
worker about two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm disabled and am waiting for back surgery," said the 40-year-old Maresh, 
who grew up in Orange. "I've just been doing woodwork to keep from going 
crazy." 
</P>
<P>
 He has pieced together more than 100 houses since taking up the hobby with 
Teri, who puts the final touches on the creations. They say it takes anywhere 
from two to 40 hours to complete a new bird abode. 
</P>
<P>
 Wooden birdhouses adorn the trees of their back yard, and play host to more 
than a dozen bird families, including hummingbirds, finches, mockingbirds and 
doves. 
</P>
<P>
 "Being that Orange is an official bird sanctuary, they might as well have a 
place to live," said Teri Maresh, who is also 40. Many of the bird shelters are 
modeled after older homes in Orange. Cody Maresh even built an elaborate 
replica of the house in which he grew up. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just like the appeal of old Orange," Cody Maresh said, "the way it used to 
be. The times when people used to sit out on their front porch and just talk to 
each other." 
</P>
<P>
 Materials for the houses have been fairly easy to obtain, the couple said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's done with scrap wood," Cody Maresh said. "What most people tear out of 
their houses, we use. Most people's trash is a treasure, really." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the birdhouses, the couple also make what they call "yard art" 
-- decorations for their front yard appropriate to upcoming holidays. Right 
now, the fence posts look like bunnies, but in a few more months new pieces 
will go up celebrating the Fourth of July. 
</P>
<P>
 Their favorite holiday is Halloween, when fences are transformed into ghosts 
and witches. 
</P>
<P>
 The works don't go unnoticed. Passersby and neighbors regularly stop to admire 
the work, some even offering to buy the pieces. While the Mareshes may sell a 
few and have even traded a birdhouse to a neighbor for a wheelbarrow, most of 
the birdhouses end up as gifts.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FOUNTAIN VALLEY; FULTON STUDENTS TAKE PENTATHLON HONORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Brains, luck and hours of study paid off for Harry C. Fulton Middle School 
students who recently became Orange County's pentathlon champions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Winning adds another accomplishment for the school," said Kimi Bacon, a 
member of the eighth-grade team. "It boosts your self-esteem and confidence." 
</P>
<P>
 More than 40 county middle schools participated in the event last month, in 
which the county was divided into two regions, with seventh- and eighth-grade 
students competing. 
</P>
<P>
 Students were tested in math, science, social science, writing and literature, 
said Alexis Dane, one of Fulton's three pentathlon coaches. 
</P>
<P>
 Fulton students captured first place overall in both seventh- and eighth-grade 
competitions and accumulated the highest number of points in both regions, Dane 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Students brought home scores of medals -- and pride in themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Two members of the school's seventh-grade team, Sean Chou and Jeff Johnson, 
were named top pentathletes in the county. Eighth-grader Mark Goodman was also 
a first-place winner. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's an outstanding experience," Dane said. "It maximizes their 
potential in a lot of ways, especially for the 'C' students. It can change 
their lives, because they get a different point of view of themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 Dane said that not only do the top-of-the-class, "bookish" students compete 
but also students who earn average grades. "You don't have to be the best," 
agreed Kimi, a "B" student. 
</P>
<P>
 Pentathlon teams have nine students who compete: three "A" students, three "B" 
students and three "C" students. Dane said more than 60 students tried out for 
the team, but only 18 students were chosen for both grades, plus 10 student 
alternates. 
</P>
<P>
 "The kids who seek to be on the team are people who thrive on competition," 
she said. "They're really responsible learners." 
</P>
<P>
 The competition helps motivate the students involved and also excites them 
about learning. "It does bring out their best," Dane said. 
</P>
<P>
 Eighth-grader Justin Chambers, who is a "C" student, said his grades have 
improved since he became involved in the pentathlon and helped him do well on a 
high school honors test. 
</P>
<P>
 Students also said that while preparing for the competition, they learn about 
things they would not have been taught in classes, such as genetics and the 
Nobel Peace Prize. 
</P>
<P>
 Fulton Principal Tom Markel said the school is proud of the team. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just want people to realize that this recognition is well-deserved," Markel 
said. "Their medals and plaques represent so much time and dedication by the 
students and coaches."DEBRA CANO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA ANA; SHELTER FOR WOMEN, KIDS TO BE DEDICATED 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Dedication ceremonies for the Mercy House Transitional Living Center, a 
shelter for homeless single women and children, will be held Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The dedication marks the completion of a $300,000 renovation and expansion of 
the historic two-home facility in Santa Ana by HomeAid Orange County.HomeAid is 
the Building Industry Assn.'s nonprofit program to help the transitionally 
homeless. 
</P>
<P>
 The center will house 25 single women and children for an average of six 
months. The shelter will assist its residents economically, emotionally and 
spiritually to help them become contributing members of the community again, 
organizers said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Single mothers and their children are the fastest-growing segment of the 
homeless population in Orange County," said Kermit Dorius, HomeAid shelter 
liaison for the project. "The addition of the Mercy House will give 
significantly more homeless mothers and children in our community a safe, clean 
place to stay." 
</P>
<P>
 The project, which took more than a year to complete, resulted from the 
efforts of more than 1,000 volunteers, including framers, plumbers, 
electricians, architects and roofers. 
</P>
<P>
 The event, which includes a ribbon-cutting ceremony, guided tours and buffet 
lunch, begins at 11 a.m. at the shelter, at 1505 and 1509 Bush St.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: TAX FILINGS DOWN ALMOST 6%, IRS SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The number of federal tax return filings in Orange County is down almost 6% 
compared to the same period last year, according to the Internal Revenue 
Service. 
</P>
<P>
 "More than half the 1.2 million tax returns for Orange County residents have 
not been filed," said Jesse Cota, director of the IRS' Laguna Niguel district. 
</P>
<P>
 "Waiting until the last minute to prepare your tax return increases the 
chances of making mistakes," Cota said. 
</P>
<P>
 "People get in a hurry and make math errors, put entries on the wrong lines or 
find they don't have all the necessary tax forms to file their return." 
</P>
<P>
 IRS officials suggest taxpayers file a return on time even if they do not have 
enough money right now and recommend they pay what they can. The balance may be 
paid in monthly installments. 
</P>
<P>
 To request a monthly payment plan, attach Form 9465, "Request for Installment 
Agreement," to the front of your tax return. Indicate on the form how much you 
can pay each month. 
</P>
<P>
 Taxpayers may have to pay penalties if they file after the April 15 deadline. 
Unless a four-month extension request is filed, a taxpayer could be charged a 
late filing penalty of as much as 25% of the tax owed. 
</P>
<P>
 "A common mistake people make when they file an extension is they assume the 
extension gives them extra time to pay the taxes," Cota said. "The extension is 
only an extension of time to file the tax return." 
</P>
<P>
 Individuals having difficulty completing tax forms can obtain free assistance 
from the IRS. 
</P>

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: PARTICIPANTS NEEDED FOR DIABETICS STUDY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Pacifica Community Hospital in Huntington Beach is seeking volunteers to take 
part in a nationwide vision study in which participants would take a drug for 
four years in order to determine if blindness can be prevented in diabetics. 
</P>
<P>
 The drug, Trental, is a medication doctors believe may be helpful with eye 
complications in people who suffer from diabetes. 
</P>
<P>
 It has been used for years to treat blood-flow problems in legs and may slow 
or prevent blood-flow problems in the back of the eye, said Sunnie Bell, 
Pacifica's director of community education. 
</P>
<P>
 Several people have signed up for the study. About 20 more are being sought. 
</P>
<P>
 People who want to participate must be diabetic, willing to submit to 
extensive eye and physical examinations once every three months, have no 
history of stomach or intestinal ulcers and no plans for pregnancy during the 
four-year study. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, participants cannot be taking the drug Coumadin, because mixing 
Coumadin and Trental could cause hemorrhaging, Bell said. 
</P>
<P>
 About 10 other hospitals across the country are also conducting the Trental 
study, Bell said. 
</P>
<P>
 Another nationwide study will be conducted at Pacifica. It is open to anyone 
65 or older and involves a complete eye examination, including pupil dilation, 
glaucoma test and vision analysis. 
</P>
<P>
 The study is intended to find out if vision correction is necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 To sign up for the studies, call (714) 841-5002 or attend a special seminar on 
eye problems in diabetics on April 23 at the hospital. MIMI KO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; GOLDEN WEST COLLEGE SEEKING ALUMNI

<TEXT>
<P>
 Are you among the 75,000 people who have attended Golden West College? If so, 
the school is looking for you. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials are trying to locate at least 6,000 graduates to form the Golden 
West College Alumni Assn., spokeswoman Lori Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Golden West College Foundation is creating a database of names, addresses 
and phone numbers of former students, she said. Volunteers are also combing 
through old records to track down graduates. 
</P>
<P>
 Once officials create a network, they will invite graduates back to campus, 
where they can help the college offer an up-to-date education for current 
students, Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
 "For community colleges to stay viable these days, they need more resources," 
Thomas said. "For example, they need input from alumni who have become police 
officers and can come back to tell criminal justice students about what is 
important in police work today." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials hope that former students can assist the college by raising money 
that would help the school keep up with technology. They also intend to start 
social activities such as picnics and reunions for graduates, Thomas said. 
</P>

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LA HABRA; YOUNG POETS RAISE MONEY TO AID TUTOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIMI KO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Maria Navarro, a 15-year-old whose boyfriend was killed in a gang fight, took 
the stage during a fund-raiser last week to tell other youths to try to avoid 
violence in a poem she wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 "Is a gang what it's meant to be, start out with hundreds and end up with 
three?" the La Habra High School sophomore recited. "All the bad dudes, they're 
all dead, stabbed down the middle or shot full of lead. . . . I don't know what 
you feel, but with senseless deaths, I can't hang." 
</P>
<P>
 The fund-raiser, sponsored by the Chicano Poet Society, raised $100 for Rose 
Espinoza, 36, a volunteer tutor, to spend on her after-school tutoring program, 
MAS (Motivating Adolescents to Succeed). The free tutoring is being offered to 
34 students in Espinoza's garage in La Habra. 
</P>
<P>
 Maria and other La Habra high, middle and elementary school students joined 
the Chicano Poet Society at Tlaquepaque Restaurant in Placentia to perform, eat 
and celebrate Latino culture with music and poetry readings in Spanish and 
English. 
</P>
<P>
 This was the year-old Poet Society's fifth monthly fund-raiser at the 
restaurant. Each one raises about $100 for different people and programs 
throughout the county. 
</P>
<P>
 The first event packed the restaurant, and proceeds went to David Vasquez, a 
volunteer who teaches free Aztec language classes at libraries and churches in 
Orange and Los Angeles counties. In December, the Poet Society raised money for 
a Fullerton theater group that offers high school students a chance to join an 
acting troupe as an alternative to gangs. 
</P>
<P>
 January's fund-raiser helped two Santa Ana families of victims of drive-by 
shootings pay for funeral expenses. Santa Ana High School students involved in 
a writing club that publishes a magazine filled with student art and writings 
were last month's recipients of the Poet Society's philanthropy. 
</P>
<P>
 Espinoza said she will let her pupils decide what to do with the money they 
received from the group. Some said they would like to buy pencils and 
dictionaries to use in the garage, while others said they would like to take a 
trip to an amusement park. 
</P>
<P>
 Espinoza, who takes her students on tours of college campuses and encourages 
them to join athletic and arts groups, said she works on raising their 
self-esteem as well as their grades. 
</P>
<P>
 Luis Borja, 12, said he couldn't believe the society was raising money for 
him. "It makes me feel pretty special," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Every Poet Society fund-raiser is open to the public. They are held the last 
Thursday night of each month at Tlaquepaque.MIMI KO

<P>
 All of Los Angeles -- as least as much of it as had television then -- watched 
on small, primitive screens 45 years ago as efforts to save a little girl's 
life played out in stark black and white. Although it ended sadly, the event 
was credited with originating live TV news. 
</P>
<P>
 The 27 1/2-hour telecast on KTLA Channel 5 proved television's power to convey 
immediate emotions as it focused on the attempt to rescue 3-year-old Kathy 
Fiscus of San Marino, who had fallen into an abandoned well constructed of a 
pipe only 14 inches in diameter and more than 100 feet deep. 
</P>
<P>
 On April 9, 1949, news had been on the air for only two years in Los Angeles, 
most of it scripted and rehearsed. 
</P>
<P>
 That Friday evening, Kathy had been running and playing in the tall, spring 
grass in an open field. Then, in an instant, she disappeared. Only her faint 
cries could be heard. 
</P>
<P>
 Kathy's mother, Alice, called for help and emergency crews soon converged on 
the field. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For two days and nights, the effort to save her transfixed the city. Crowds 
gathered outside music and appliance store windows to watch on TV; others 
shared their sets with neighbors. There were about 20,000 television sets in 
Los Angeles County, which had a population of 4 million. 
</P>
<P>
 As rescue efforts continued into Saturday, KTLA's general manager, Klaus 
Landsberg, decided to send sportscaster Bill Welsh and special events announcer 
Stan Chambers to the scene. KTLA's other programs and commercials were 
canceled. As TV crews arrived, firemen had already slipped air hoses down the 
45-year-old shaft. Crowds of spectators, who had heard of the rescue on radio 
or seen it on TV, had to be held back by police. 
</P>
<P>
 Volunteers answered calls for skilled help or people who might be able to 
maneuver in the cramped shaft. Among them was a former coal miner, who, until 
that moment, had sworn he would never go underground again; a former Navy 
diver; jockeys; and an unemployed construction foreman who borrowed carfare to 
get to the scene. 
</P>
<P>
 Alice Fiscus refused to give up hope. Early on, Kathy had managed to hold onto 
a rope. She was pulled up a few feet, but her tiny hands lost their grip and 
she slid back down. 
</P>
<P>
 The tension grew at every setback, but the digging went on. A shaft was 
excavated parallel to the pipe, but when workers tried to descend, the sides 
crumbled. Another shaft on the other side soon began to fill with water. Hourly 
reports let the public know how close rescuers were. Kathy had slid 94 feet 
down the shaft. 
</P>
<P>
 A microphone dangled into the pipe picked up what rescuers thought was Kathy's 
breathing. The digging resumed with renewed fervor. 
</P>
<P>
 For 50 hours, volunteers and San Marino city workers raced the clock as 
television cameras rolled. When they finally cut through the corroded pipe at 
6:03 p.m. Sunday, Kathy Fiscus was dead. 
</P>
<P>
 The family physician announced that she had probably died within two hours of 
slipping into the well. The coroner's report would later say that Kathy died 
from lack of oxygen because her knees were pressed against her chest. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The dirty and tired rescue workers, along with a crowd of a thousand or more, 
wept openly. So did thousands more listening to the radio or watching the new 
medium of television. 
</P>
<P>
 Offers of jobs and more than $43,000 poured in for the 132 volunteers. Many of 
them pooled their shares for a Kathy Fiscus scholarship at Pomona College. 
</P>
<P>
 One month later, Gov. Earl Warren signed a bill to tighten safety requirements 
for abandoned wells. On the same day his daughter slipped down the water shaft, 
Kathy Fiscus' father, David, a water engineer, had testified in Sacramento in 
support of covering abandoned wells with concrete. 
</P>
<P>
 David Fiscus died in 1975, and Alice now lives near another daughter, Barbara, 
in San Diego County. Kathy is buried in Chula Vista. Flowers are often left on 
her grave by strangers. Today, Alice Fiscus says: "It always astounds me when I 
think of all the wonderful things everyone did, giving of their time and 
hearts. I always hope in telling this story again, it might help other 
children." 
</P>
<P>
 KTLA's coverage was a turning point in TV history. Its marathon live reporting 
from the scene taught executives and audiences the potential of the news 
camera. 
</P>
<P>
 The old well that claimed the life of Kathy Fiscus has long since been filled 
in. There is no trace of it on what is now an athletic field at San Marino High 
School. The nearest reference is a bronze marker behind the San Marino City 
Library. The marker, like the one on Kathy's grave, recalls "a little girl who 
brought the world together -- for a moment." CECILIA RASMUSSEN

MAN ATTACKING MOTHER WITH HAMMER IS KILLED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A man restrained and killed his claw-hammer-wielding brother as the brother 
attacked their mother in a brutal family argument at their home on the Eastside 
early Saturday, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 69-year-old woman, Maria Nersesian, was in critical condition Sunday after 
the attack.Her son Setrak, 43, was in serious condition. Both were bleeding 
from the face and head when deputies arrived at their home Saturday, Los 
Angeles County Sheriff's Deputy Benita Hinojos said. 
</P>
<P>
 Willard Nersesian, 45, had attacked his mother with a claw hammer as she lay 
in bed in a darkened room, Hinojos said Sunday. Setrak Nersesian came to her 
defense when he heard her screams, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Willard Nersesian turned the hammer on his younger brother, who got Willard 
into a chokehold, face-down on a sofa, Hinojos said. After Willard ceased 
struggling, Setrak asked a neighbor to summon police. 
</P>
<P>
 Maria and Setrak Nersesian were taken to Los Angeles County-USC Medical 
Center. Paramedics pronounced Willard Nersesian dead at the scene. 
</P>
<P>
 The motive for the attack was unclear, although "there had been recent 
problems concerning (Willard's) habitual drug abuse," Hinojos said. 
</P>
<P>
 Willard Nersesian's death is being investigated, but his brother has not been 
arrested, Hinojos said.

4 CRASH VICTIMS IDENTIFIED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The coroner's office Sunday identified four teen-agers who were killed when 
the new car they were in veered into oncoming traffic on Sunset Boulevard and 
smashed into a pickup. 
</P>
<P>
 The driver of the 1994 Acura was Hong Kim, 17, of Los Angeles, a spokesman 
said.The passengers, all 16, were Yun Chung of Los Angeles and Soo Hyun and 
Vicky Jung of Rowland Heights. 
</P>
<P>
 All died early Saturday when their car, reportedly speeding east on Sunset 
Boulevard near UCLA, veered into the westbound lanes, smashing into the pickup. 
The two women in the truck were injured. Both were admitted to UCLA Medical 
Center, where one was in critical condition Sunday with head injuries, and the 
other in fair condition with a broken leg and cuts and bruises.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: NEWPORT BEACH; MAID GETS REWARD FOR RETURNING GEMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Maria Jimenez, a maid at the Newport Beach Marriott Hotel and Tennis Club, 
never thought twice about turning in the bag of jewelry valued at $100,000 she 
found stashed behind the draperies in Room 907. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday Jimenez got her reward, a $300 check and a 19-carat gold necklace 
from a grateful Shirley Wagner, the Beverly Hills woman who checked out of the 
hotel March 28 and left her uninsured jewelry behind. 
</P>
<P>
 Salvador Orozco, the hotel's housekeeping manager, said Jimenez opened the 
case in the room when she found it and saw that it contained valuables. 
</P>
<P>
 Through an interpreter, Jimenez, 23, who has worked at the hotel five years, 
said she promptly turned in the jewelry case to her supervisor because her 
mother raised her to be honest. 
</P>
<P>
 In the check presentation on Sunday, Wagner said she had brought the uninsured 
jewelry with her to the hotel because she was afraid that she might lose it at 
home should there be an earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 But when Wagner checked out of the hotel, she forgot to retrieve the valuables 
from where she had placed them behind the drapes.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: PLACENTIA; CITY WEIGHS EL TORO PANEL MEMBERSHIP 
</P>

<P>
 The City Council will decide Tuesday whether to appoint a council member to 
the advisory body to the El Toro Reuse Planning Authority, a county agency that 
could determine the redevelopment of the El Toro Marine Corps Air Station. 
</P>
<P>
 But Mayor Norman Z. Eckenrode has already objected to the authority's voting 
setup, which gives voting privileges only to the County Board of Supervisors 
and representatives from two cities in the county. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every city should have a say in how El Toro is used," Eckenrode said, 
referring to the voting arrangement. "I would strongly object to not having 
that say." 
</P>
<P>
 The Board of Supervisors has invited Placentia to send a representative to 
serve on the Executive Council, which will advise the planning authority on 
reuse of the Marine base. The planning authority, which has voting power, 
consists of the five supervisors, three council members from Irvine and one 
from Lake Forest. The Executive Council has no final decision-making authority, 
which has angered several other cities who do not have representatives on the 
planning authority. 
</P>
<P>
 The council has stayed out of the debate about who should determine how the 
base is used when the Marine Corps moves out in 1999. It did not join the 
Orange County Regional Airport Authority, formed by several other cities in a 
failed attempt to wrest control of base reuse planning authority away from the 
Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 But local council members have said the city is leaning toward supporting a 
commercial airport at the site. Business leaders who support an airport at the 
base believe the makeup of the county planning agency is biased against a 
commercial aviation facility. 
</P>
<P>
 Eckenrode said the city would support a commercial airport at the site because 
it would provide thousands of jobs, "some of them in Placentia." DANIELLE A.

<P>
 Heritage Oak Private Elementary School is adding a middle school to its 
facility because of parent demand, school officials have announced. 
</P>
<P>
 Beginning in September, seventh-graders will be admitted to the school, and in 
1995, an eighth grade will be added, said Heritage Oak Executive Director 
Phylis Cygan. 
</P>
<P>
 The new middle school's curriculum will emphasize math, language arts, science 
and French. In addition, music, art and public speaking courses will be offered 
along with classes on leadership skills and good deportment, Cygan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents "wanted their kids in a school like this before going to high school 
without having to go to public schools for middle school," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 There are 165 students in the kindergarten-through-sixth-grade school, at 1620 
N. Placentia Ave. About 15 seventh-graders are expected to be added to the 
school in September, Cygan said. MIMI KO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: IRVINE; KIDS NEEDED FOR UCI HYPERACTIVITY STUDY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 UC Irvine's Child Development Center is looking for children who suffer from 
Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder to take part in a two-year research 
project. 
</P>
<P>
 The $2.5-million study, sponsored by the U.S. Department of Education and 
National Institute of Mental Health, will look at different ways of treating 
the disorder. 
</P>
<P>
 About 100 children between the ages of 7 and 9 are needed for the study. Some 
participants will receive the drug Ritalin, which is commonly used by doctors 
to treat hyperactivity, said Tim Wigal, assistant director of the Child 
Development Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Other children in the study will take Ritalin and work with psychologists and 
pediatricians as part of a special treatment program. 
</P>
<P>
 A third group of children will take part only in the treatment program. 
</P>
<P>
 Wigal said the goal of the study is to measure the effectiveness of Ritalin 
and look at new ways of dealing with hyperactivity, which often brings about 
learning and behavioral problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Children who take part in the study will be required to visit UC Irvine 
weekly, so officials said participants should live within 15 miles of the 
campus. 
</P>
<P>
 The UC Irvine research is part of a $16-million study of hyperactivity taking 
place in the United States and Canada. 
</P>
<P>
 For more information, call (714) 833-8588 before April 15.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: NEWPORT BEACH; BALBOA TO USE ART FOR BUSINESS' SAKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHELBY GRAD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Merchants are turning to art in a bid to lure visitors -- and customers -- to 
Balboa Peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
 A colorful mural erected last week in the heart of the neighborhood's quaint 
business district is the first step in this effort. 
</P>
<P>
 Another mural will be painted Saturday, and an art fair and concert are 
scheduled for May. 
</P>
<P>
 Balboa business leaders hope this focus on the arts will give the upscale area 
a new attractive identity and provide a boost to the peninsula's sluggish 
retail economy. 
</P>
<P>
 "We hope to enliven this area," said Dayna Pettit, a longtime Balboa 
businesswoman and resident. "If it happens the way we hope, this will create an 
atmosphere that brings people back here." 
</P>
<P>
 Like many beach areas, the Balboa Peninsula sees business pick up during the 
summer and drop off during the fall and winter. 
</P>
<P>
 But in recent years, merchants said, business has slowed down, causing a few 
shops to close. 
</P>
<P>
 The business district is in the heart of Newport Bay and is surrounded by tony 
beachfront homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite its picturesque surroundings, the area suffers from a parking 
shortage. 
</P>
<P>
 The arts projects are aimed at attracting local residents as well as tourists 
to the area, providing the island with a steady stream of customers year-round. 
</P>
<P>
 The Balboa Merchants-Owners Assn. also plans to start aggressively promoting 
the peninsula to potential visitors and merchants. 
</P>
<P>
 Some promotional ads will appear on cable television. 
</P>
<P>
 But the centerpiece of the revitalization drive is the art. It began in 
earnest last week when artist Debra Huse's 8-by-10-foot mural was attached to 
the side of the Balboa Bakery at 301 Main St. 
</P>
<P>
 Huse's mural depicts several girls sitting on a beach near a lifeguard tower. 
A message on the work reads: "Welcome to Newport Beach, Saluting the Arts." 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, a second mural of swimming dolphins will be painted on the side 
of the Mel Fuchs Real Estate building, near Balboa Boulevard and Washington 
Street. 
</P>
<P>
 The dolphin mural will be designed by a local artist and painted with the help 
of students from Newport Elementary School. 
</P>
<P>
 In May, Balboa will host an arts and craft fair and musical concert. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a wonderful location," Pettit said. "We want this to be a place where 
people can come to meet, shop and enjoy themselves." SHELBY GRAD

Orange, where he died. Police said they did not find a weapon at the scene. 
</P>

VEHICLE HITS POWER POLE, CAUSING OUTAGE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 More than 18,000 homes were without electricity for several hours early Sunday 
after a driver fell asleep and struck a utility pole in Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
 City crews restored power to all the homes by 7:35 a.m., Los Angeles 
Department of Water and Power spokeswoman Debra Sass said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's unusual to have that many customers lose power from one accident," Sass 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The driver, who was not injured, crashed into the pole at the intersection of 
Ethel Avenue and Oxnard Street shortly after 1 a.m., after dozing off at the 
wheel, said Los Angeles Police Officer Vince Vicary.

3 ARRESTED IN AUTO THEFT AFTER CHASE THROUGH 3 CITIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two 15-year-olds and an adult were arrested Sunday on suspicion of auto theft 
and evading arrest after allegedly leading police on a 30-minute car chase that 
passed through three cities and reached speeds of 100 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said the two juveniles and Jose M. Cortez, 18, all of Santa Ana, stole 
a car in Garden Grove and were later spotted in Orange by an Orange police 
officer. A chase began that lead police and California Highway Patrol along 
freeways and streets in Garden Grove, Orange and Anaheim, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The pursuit ended at Euclid Street and Hazard Avenue in Garden Grove, where 
the alleged thieves jumped out of the car. Police reported capturing the three 
as they tried to flee on foot. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a miracle there wasn't a major accident. These guys drove like utter 
maniacs," Orange Police Department Lt. Trey Sirks said. The two juveniles were 
sent to Juvenile Hall, and Cortez was being held at County Jail, Sirks said.

APARTMENT FIRE FORCES 29 RESIDENTS TO FLEE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A suspected arson fire swept through a two-story apartment building and a 
duplex in Downtown Los Angeles on Sunday, forcing 29 people out of their homes. 
</P>
<P>
 The fire started about 3 a.m. in a car inside a garage. "It looks like 
somebody torched the car," said Los Angeles Fire Department spokesman Bob 
Collis. 
</P>
<P>
 The fire quickly spread through the occupied building to the empty duplex next 
door on South Orchard Avenue, Collis said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fifty-five firefighters battled the blaze, which was extinguished in about 30 
minutes. No injuries were reported. 
</P>
<P>
 The Red Cross issued motel vouchers to all 29 displaced people and plans to 
help the families relocate if necessary.

MIKE PENNER: ANGELS NEED MORE THAN REALIGNMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE PENNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Fab Four they are not. Any way you want to look at the six divisions 
composing big league baseball's realigned state, they would have to rate as the 
final four. 
</P>
<P>
 The team with the best starting pitching in the division, Seattle, has no 
relief pitching. 
</P>
<P>
 The team with the best hitting in the division, Texas, has no starting 
pitching. 
</P>
<P>
 The team with the best tradition in the division, Oakland, has no Catfish 
Hunter, Vida Blue, Reggie Jackson, Sal Bando or Bert Campaneris. 
</P>
<P>
 And the team allegedly building around kids today for a brighter tomorrow, the 
Angels, will open this season with a 33-year-old playing second base, a 
31-year-old and a 30-year-old platooning in left field, a 34-year-old at 
designated hitter and four starting pitchers between the ages of 30 and 33. 
</P>
<P>
 Greetings from the American League West, where the best teams in the division 
are no longer in the division. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chicago White Sox, champions of the AL West in 1993, have moved to the AL 
Central, which they are expected to own in 1994. Kansas City and Minnesota have 
moved over as well, taking with them a combined three World Series 
championships since 1985. 
</P>
<P>
 What's left are the Mariners and the Rangers, who have played a combined 50 
seasons without qualifying for the playoffs once; the Angels, who have played 
33 seasons without winning the pennant once; and the A's, who are coming off 
their worst finish in 15 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Guess what? 
</P>
<P>
 One of these teams will be in this year's American League playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 What a concept: Win 83 of 162 games, win a division championship. That's all 
it would have taken in 1993, had realignment struck 12 months earlier. Seattle, 
a mere 82-80, just a called strike or two above .500, would have finished 
second -- nine games ahead of the Angels and 14 ahead of the A's. 
</P>
<P>
 No wonder the Angels are bristling with optimism as they fly to Minneapolis 
for Tuesday's opener, toting with them: 
</P>
<P>
 -- A pitching staff that produced mushroom clouds in Arizona and ought to be 
checked for unsafe radiation levels. 
</P>
<P>
 -- An infield with three new starters, including rookie Eduardo Perez, moving 
from third base to left field to first base; virtual rookie Damion Easley, 
moving from third base to second base back to third base; and 33-year-old 
second baseman Harold Reynolds, moving from Baltimore to San Diego to Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A left-field platoon consisting of two pinch-hitters -- Bo Jackson, who has 
had hip replacement surgery, and Dwight Smith, who is considering glove 
replacement surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 -- And not one carry-on item left over from Whitey Herzog's trade of trades, 
Jim Abbott to the New York Yankees for three minor leaguers who, 16 months 
later, remain minor leaguers. J.T. Snow, Russ Springer and Jerry Nielsen will 
all begin this season at triple-A Vancouver. 
</P>
<P>
 Had Herzog never made that deal, and protected a certain relief pitcher in the 
expansion draft of '92, the Angels would be odds-on favorites to win the West 
today. 
</P>
<P>
 How would a rotation of Mark Langston, Chuck Finley, Jim Abbott, Phil Leftwich 
and John Dopson look in a division where Bobby Witt is considered the ace in 
Oakland and Kevin Brown, Kenny Rogers and Jack Armstrong are the Big Three in 
Texas? 
</P>
<P>
 How big an impact would Bryan Harvey make in a division where the on-paper 
favorite on April 4, Seattle, will attempt to close out games with either Bobby 
Ayala (three saves in 1993) or Bobby Thigpen (two saves in a 
season-and-a-half)? 
</P>
<P>
 Herzog set the program back two, three years with those two moves, and that's 
not saying anything about the Kelly Gruber, J.R. Phillips and Joe Magrane 
moves. You won't get Bill Bavasi to say it, but the new Angel general manager's 
first three months on the job have been devoted to cleaning up after Whitey. 
Grab a push broom and sweep those old miscalculations as far into the corner as 
you can. 
</P>
<P>
 Snow was brought in by Herzog to play first base for the Angels for the next 
10 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Bavasi and Buck Rodgers reassigned Snow to Vancouver and now are considering 
all offers. 
</P>
<P>
 Spike Owen was brought in by Herzog to platoon at second base with Kevin 
Flora. 
</P>
<P>
 Bavasi and Rodgers traded for Reynolds, sent Flora down and told Owen to back 
up Gary DiSarcina. 
</P>
<P>
 Whitey Ball professes that speed and defense will outrun the three-run home 
run every time. 
</P>
<P>
 Bavasi and Rodgers replaced Snow's potential Gold Glove with Perez's potential 
20-home run bat, gambled on Bo's all-or-nothing swing and signed Smith on the 
basis of his .300 batting average, ignoring the red flags about his ability in 
left field. 
</P>
<P>
 The Abbott and Magrane decisions left Rodgers with two gaping holes in his 
five-man rotation, so Bavasi went out and plugged them with Dopson and Mark 
Leiter. That could change just as soon as Bavasi trades Snow for anyone better 
than Anthony Young, or as soon as Brian Anderson wets his feet in triple-A, but 
until then, it's reassuring to know that the Angels won't have to play any 
games without a starting pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
 Where are these Angels headed? 
</P>
<P>
 Well, they go to Minnesota today, Milwaukee on Friday and Baltimore on the 
19th . . .  
</P>
<P>
 As for the AL West standings, I'd have to say that after Seattle and Texas, 
everything's up for grabs. 
</P>
<P>
 With very few exceptions, the remaining superstars in the division reside in 
these two ports of call -- Randy Johnson, Ken Griffey Jr., Juan Gonzalez, Tom 
Henke, Jose Canseco. Put the Mariners and the Rangers down for 1-2, one way or 
the other. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Angels will be in the mix, somewhere, and when's the last time this 
franchise could say that without the room breaking out in laughter? 
</P>
<P>
 So it's an inferior mix? 
</P>
<P>
 So what? 
</P>
<P>
 If the Angels are still playing meaningful games come Sept. 15, realignment 
will be hailed as the greatest thing to hit Anaheim Stadium since the cinnamon 
roll.

STRAWBERRY: LOST, FOUND AND OUT?; BASEBALL: DODGER SLUGGER SKIPS FREEWAY SERIES 
FINALE FOR UNDISCLOSED REASONS. CLAIRE CALLS EXCUSE UNACCEPTABLE AND HIS FUTURE 
WITH TEAM IS IN DOUBT. 
</P>

 Darryl Strawberry, missing for nearly 24 hours, was located in apparently good 
health late Sunday, but his career with the Dodgers appears to be over. 
</P>
<P>
 In a sudden turn to what the Dodgers had hoped would be a promising season for 
the troubled outfielder, Strawberry failed to show up for Sunday's game against 
the Angels at Anaheim Stadium. Attempts to locate him proved futile until about 
8 p.m., when Strawberry spoke to Executive Vice President Fred Claire. 
Afterward, Claire issued a terse statement, calling Strawberry's action 
inexcusable. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have spoken to Darryl and he is with his family," Claire said in a prepared 
statement. "I am not satisfied with the explanation he has given me for his 
failure to report for the game today. I intend to meet with Darryl (today) to 
review the matter in detail and to determine what the appropriate disciplinary 
action will be. This type of behavior is extremely detrimental to the ballclub 
and will not be tolerated." 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday's incident is the latest in a series of troubles Strawberry has endured 
with the Dodgers since signing a $20.25-million contract before the 1991 
season. At the very least, his future with the team is in doubt. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dodgers owe Strawberry $8 million for two years, including this season, 
but his contract could be voided if he breached a standard good-behavior 
clause. The reason for his absence was not disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
 Either way, Claire said late last year that one more incident by Strawberry 
would not be tolerated. That sentiment was precipitated by last season's 
numerous problems. Strawberry, trying to come back from back surgery, had a 
dismal time on the field as well as off it. In September, he was arrested for 
allegedly assaulting his girlfriend, Charisse, now his wife. The charge was 
later dropped. 
</P>
<P>
 But after a season of disregarding rules concerning his rehabilitation, Claire 
had had enough. He began to shop Strawberry as early as August before the 
trading deadline and continued throughout the rest of the season. After 
Strawberry showed disrespect for Los Angeles fire victims last November, Claire 
put Strawberry on the waiver wire, making him available to any team for 
$20,000, plus his remaining contract. There were no takers. 
</P>
<P>
 That move seemed to shake up Strawberry, who once again in his tumultuous, 
11-year career, rededicated himself. Since then, he has shown a strong work 
ethic, so much so, that he even was an example for teammates. During the 
spring, he was often the first one to arrive at the clubhouse and one of the 
last to leave. "My guess is as good as yours," said Dodger Brett Butler after 
hearing Claire's statement. "I look at the spring and it looked like change, it 
looked positive and upbeat. I thought things were ready to go." 
</P>
<P>
 In December, Strawberry, 32, married Charisse Simon, and they recently had a 
son, Jordan Shay. He talked about his hope and confidence that he would once 
again be dominating on the field. And his health appeared fine. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dodgers moved him from right field to left field to help ease the stress 
on his back from throws, and he was starting to hit the ball hard. But Friday 
night, in his debut at Dodger Stadium after not playing since June of 1993, he 
was booed by the fans. It started in the first inning when he misplayed a ball 
for an error, allowing a runner to score, and continued as he went 0 for 4. 
</P>
<P>
 After the game, Strawberry said the booing didn't bother him. Then Saturday 
night, he hit a homer run over the right field fence. After the game, teammates 
said he appeared happy. So, when he didn't show up for Sunday's game, the 
players were concerned. Claire continued throughout the day to try to locate 
Strawberry, but attempts were unsuccessful. Charisse Strawberry told the 
Dodgers she hadn't seen him since Saturday night, but was expecting him after 
Sunday's game for a family function. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just hope he's all right," said Delino DeShields, who has become good 
friends with Strawberry during the spring. "I'm thinking of his health. The 
man's got a family. He's got children. Regardless of what happens he's still 
going to be my friend." 
</P>
<P>
 Since breaking into the majors with the New York Mets in 1983, Strawberry has 
continually been plagued with controversy. In the spring of 1990, he entered an 
alcohol rehabilitation clinic and acknowledged hitting his first wife, Lisa. 
Most recently, Strawberry has been the target of an IRS probe of several 
baseball players for failing to report income tax from card shows. But Marty 
Gelfand, Strawberry's attorney, said Sunday night that there has been no action 
taken by the IRS. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whatever happened (Sunday) has nothing to do with the IRS tax investigation," 
Gelfand said.

MIKE DOWNEY: HE'S A CHAMPION OFF DUKE'S BENCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By MIKE DOWNEY

<TEXT>
<P>
 The six Clark sisters, they could all play. And sisterhood or no sisterhood, 
some of their driveway games could get pretty rough. The eldest daughters, 
Sharon and Margaret, ended up playing collegiately for Pepperdine and having 
excellent basketball careers. A younger sister currently plays for DePaul. 
Another one plays for a smaller college in Colorado. The two youngest Clark 
girls can play the game, too. 
</P>
<P>
 And then there's their only brother, Marty. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, there's only so much testosterone in my family," Marty can't resist 
saying. 
</P>
<P>
 Marty Clark is a basketball player himself. He has a chance tonight to become 
a fairly immortal basketball player, if indeed it is possible for someone to 
become fairly immortal. Marty is one of three members of the Duke squad who can 
become a three-time national champion. He and Grant Hill and Antonio Lang can 
do what very few have done. They can do something that might even make some of 
their old teammates jealous. 
</P>
<P>
 Christian Laettner never won three. Neither did Bobby Hurley or Thomas Hill. 
</P>
<P>
 "Down deep, they don't want us to, either," Clark says. 
</P>
<P>
 He is only saying this to be funny. You know that Duke basketball crowd, 
always making with the jokes. Like the fans of the Blue Devils who responded 
Saturday after rooters for the Razorbacks from Arkansas began chanting, "We 
want Duke! We want Duke!" The snappy comeback from every Duke fan to the Hogs 
was: "I smell bacon! I smell bacon!" 
</P>
<P>
 Sounds good to Clark. Get the skillet. Turn those Razorbacks into strips of 
Oscar Mayer tonight and, wow, what a way to go out. Three championships. Let's 
see Laettner top that, up there in Timberwolf country where it's cold, even 
with all his NBA money and all. 
</P>
<P>
 "My first phone call after the game goes right up to Minneapolis," Clark says, 
provided Duke wins. 
</P>
<P>
 And why not? Tweak the big guy. Hey, hadn't Laettner gotten on him? Hadn't 
Marty had some pretty un-Christian thoughts toward Christian, for a while 
there? 
</P>
<P>
 Clark says, "Well, hate is a strong word. But I didn't get along with 
Christian for a long time, no. He gets on people. And he doesn't let people get 
too close, so they don't really get to know him. That's why he's misperceived a 
lot, I think. He's a unique person." 
</P>
<P>
 And competitive. 
</P>
<P>
 "See, that's it," Clark says. "Duke's a competitive program. It's an inherent 
part of the entire Duke experience. It's almost ridiculous how competitive we 
can be, just around each other. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you followed us around the country with a video camera, you wouldn't 
believe your eyes half the time. We can get pretty crazy, whether it's 
basketball, Ping-Pong, playing our Sega games, wrestling in the room, 
slap-boxing or whatever." 
</P>
<P>
 Slap-boxing? You mean, like, slapping one another's hands or slapping upside 
the face? 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, man," Clark says, "I mean full-contact slap-boxing. Do we ever. You take 
Tony Lang, for instance. He took some actual boxing lessons last summer. Me, 
too. Only now Tony thinks if he ever got into a ring full-time, he'd be another 
Muhammad Ali." 
</P>
<P>
 Who's the best Duke slapper? "I guess probably Laettner," Clark says. "Or at 
least he thinks he is. Christian thought he had the quickest hands this side of 
the Mississippi." 
</P>
<P>
 Competitive. That's Duke in a nutshell. That's why the national championship 
trophy might end up on a shelf in North Carolina for the fourth year in a row. 
That's why only two teams west of that Mississippi River -- Kansas (1988) and 
Nevada Las Vegas (1990) -- have won the NCAA tournament since UCLA did in 1975. 
And that's why Clark, a 6-foot-6 senior who is one of Duke's team captains but 
not even a starter, has a chance to become fairly immortal. 
</P>
<P>
 From the time he played against his various sisters in what he remembers as 
"some vicious two-on-two games," Clark says he has been a dreamer. All he 
required was a place to play, same as his sisters. He grew up tall, same as 
they did. (Both Margaret and Sharon stand taller than 6-3.) Their father built 
them a basketball court in Colorado, put them in private schools in Illinois. 
Marty went to the same high school Isiah Thomas did, a Catholic school in 
Chicago's suburbs, St. Joseph's. His principal problem, he says, was waiting 
for his six sisters to free up the family bath. 
</P>
<P>
 He went to Duke to study economics. Then he almost left for lack of playing 
time, until Billy McCaffrey beat him to it. The trouble with playing at Duke is 
being good enough to play. Marty has started 10 games in four seasons.  
</P>
<P>
 "Playing time, it's like air to a player," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday, he got some. Clark got 24 minutes of playing time. His game had been 
off of late, but the coach had faith. Into the game went Clark with a pat on 
his reddish head. He gave Duke eight points, three assists, three rebounds, 
four steals and a block. With 41 seconds to play, Marty stripped the ball from 
Dan Cross of Florida and fed it to Cherokee Parks, whose layup gave Duke the 
game. Said Mike Krzyzewski, the coach: "We don't win this game without Marty 
Clark." 
</P>
<P>
 All those days and nights on the bench, they mattered no more. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've had a lot of really, really, really good players playing in front of 
me," Clark says. "But I haven't quit. You're not going to win a championship 
with five guys. And how many guys ever win three?" 
</P>
<P>
 Some people hope Duke won't. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, they're just tired of us winning all the time," Marty says. 
</P>
<P>
 He's sorry, but that's the way it is. Wake up and smell the bacon.

COLLEGE BASKETBALL / NCAA MEN'S AND WOMEN'S CHAMPIONSHIP GAMES; THEY COULD BE 
IN FOR A DEVIL OF A TIME; MEN: DEPTH OF ARKANSAS COULD MAKE IT TOUGH ON DUKE IN 
THE CHAMPIONSHIP GAME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Before returning home to Gainesville and sparing America the Southeastern 
Conference Tournament -- The Sequel, the Florida Gators issued a warning to 
Duke, the team that sent them packing. 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing personal, they said of tonight's NCAA championship game between the 
Blue Devils and Arkansas, but be afraid. Be very afraid. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's 40 minutes of hell and believe me, I know," said Gator guard Dan Cross, 
whose team lost to Duke in Saturday's semifinals by five points and to the 
Razorbacks by 12 in mid-February. "They rotate a lot of people out on the 
floor. Once one player gets tired, another player comes in. Once he gets tired, 
another player comes in. I think (the Blue Devils) will have their hands full." 
</P>
<P>
 Imagine that, Duke an underdog. The team that has advanced to the title game 
four of the last five seasons -- and won two NCAA championships in the process 
-- now finds itself a victim of role reversal. 
</P>
<P>
 Even with a lineup that includes gifted swingman Grant Hill, whom Duke's Mike 
Krzyzewski says is the best player he's ever coached, the Blue Devils generally 
are considered pregame second-bests to Arkansas. In fact, one of the 
pro-Razorback testimonials came from Krzyzewski himself. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Arkansas is a better team than us," he said, quick to add that better 
doesn't always guarantee a victory.  
</P>
<P>
 Making matters worse for Duke is news that center Cherokee Parks suffered a 
strained left knee and possibly a slight cartilage tear during the victory 
against Florida. Krzyzewski said Parks, who is the team's leading rebounder and 
second-leading scorer, definitely will play tonight, but who knows for how long 
or at what level. 
</P>
<P>
 Arkansas has no such problems. With the exception of guard Corey Beck, who 
missed Sunday's press conferences because of a slight allergy attack, the 
Razorbacks are healthy, confident and anxious. 
</P>
<P>
 Even more impressive is that Richardson and his players show no signs of 
weakening under the weight of the industrial-sized chips on their shoulders. To 
a man, the Razorbacks are convinced that they don't receive the proper respect 
or national acclaim befitting of their accomplishments. 
</P>
<P>
 Arkansas ended the regular season No. 1 in the coaches' poll and spent nine 
weeks atop the Associated Press poll before North Carolina slipped past it in 
the final writers' ballot. The Razorbacks also were seeded No. 1 in the Midwest 
Regional and are followed by President Bill Clinton, who is scheduled to watch 
tonight's game from a Charlotte Coliseum luxury box. And Richardson, who is 
leading the 'we-get-no-recognition' charge, recently was named coach of the 
year by separate organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 So go figure. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're only one stop from the outhouse," Richardson said Sunday. "Right now, 
I'm in the penthouse. But I can see it: 'Can't Win The Big One' headlines." 
</P>
<P>
 Said a slightly perplexed Krzyzewski, who can't understand what all the fuss 
is about: "All I know is that they've been No. 1 for most of the year. I know 
in the (coaching) profession, they are very, very highly respected." 
</P>
<P>
 And, if you ask Florida, a team also to be feared. 
</P>
<P>
 As usual, Richardson is employing his Cecil B. DeMille Theory of Coaching -- 
that is, star forward Corliss Williamson and seemingly a cast of thousands. 
</P>
<P>
 All Williamson has done in this year's tournament is make 45 of 65 shots 
(69.2%), run like a guard and, as he did during the regular season, lead the 
Razorbacks in scoring and rebounding. No wonder both Richardson and Krzyzewski 
call him one of the top five players in the country. 
</P>
<P>
 "The big men for Duke will have their hands full," said Gator guard Craig 
Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 Or course, Brown said this before Parks woke up Sunday with a swollen knee. 
Just think what might happen if Parks' injury significantly hampers his play. 
That means backup Erik Meeks and Meeks' backup, seldom-used freshman Greg 
Newton, will be pressed into extensive duty.  
</P>
<P>
 Williamson isn't the only worry. There is Scotty Thurman, Al Dillard, Clint 
McDaniel, Darnell Robinson, Dwight Stewart, Beck and whoever else Richardson 
wants to send into the game. In this case, senior forward Ken Biley, who 
averages less than 2.9 minutes per game, gets a going-away start from the 
Razorback coach. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, eight Arkansas players average at least 18 minutes. Two others average 
12.2 and 9.7. 
</P>
<P>
 Duke doesn't have that luxury. Newspaper presses stop when Hill plays less 
than 35 minutes. So do the Blue Devils. 
</P>
<P>
 If nothing else, though, Duke does have lots of Final Four experience. The 
game is being played in Duke-friendly Charlotte and the Blue Devils have 
performed well this season when they weren't favored to win. Someone Sunday 
even mentioned the 1991 national semifinal victory against powerful Nevada Las 
Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill shot down that idea.  
</P>
<P>
 "I felt better playing against Vegas than I do against Arkansas," he said. "We 
had a week to prepare. Coach K had us really believing we could beat UNLV. We 
were confident and, plus, they weren't as deep as Arkansas. They were very 
tough, very experienced -- great players on a great team, but they were pretty 
much a five-man team. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whereas Arkansas, it seems like they bring cheerleaders out there, managers, 
fans. They have so many guys out there on the court and they have no slippage 
at all. A lot like North Carolina." 
</P>
<P>
 Duke's record vs. the taller and deeper Tar Heels this season: 0-2, with North 
Carolina's average margin of victory 10.5 points.

HERSHISER CONTINUES HIS CLIMB; DODGERS: HE HOPES TO PITCH FOUR MORE YEARS, 
REALIZING HIS 1988 ACCOMPLISHMENTS ARE ALL BUT IMPOSSIBLE TO MATCH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARYANN HUDSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was the winter after a most remarkable 1988 season that Orel Hershiser 
began to understand. 
</P>
<P>
 After rising to feed his new son in the middle of the night, Hershiser would 
sit and watch his many accomplishments on highlight film. That's when the 
realization set in. That's when he knew he was about to face the biggest fall 
of his life. 
</P>
<P>
 So, Hershiser went on his way, dogged by the attention given a president, and 
deservedly so. After winning 23 games, throwing 59 consecutive scoreless 
innings and pitching the Dodgers to the 1988 World Series championship, even 
the tabloid reporters were grilling Hershiser's friends. 
</P>
<P>
 You know you've made it when that happens. Hershiser's Cy Young season had 
been a career. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not easy setting the standard by which you are judged, but Hershiser did, 
and has paid for it -- with a blown-out shoulder and overblown expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 "People ask me all the time about Orel," said his father, Orel Hershiser III. 
"But 1988 was a phenomenal year." 
</P>
<P>
 However unreal, it was engraved in the hearts of many who wonder what has 
happened since.  
</P>
<P>
 So what if Hershiser had arm surgery a season later. Inquiring minds wonder 
when is he going to throw like 1988 again. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know what others expectations are of me, but I would say there is a 
wide range, from the person who thinks I should be completely finished and is 
surprised every time I take the mound, to the person that expects the same 
person who pitched in 1988 to perform out there, and can't understand why," 
Hershiser said. "I think both opinions are valid and both are naive at the same 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are valid in the fact that the person who thinks I shouldn't be pitching 
is probably right because I had a career-ending injury, and the person who 
expects the 1988 person to show up is probably valid because it has been 
accomplished by this body that has this name on it. But both are naive because 
there has been a long time since the surgery, I have proven that I'm back.  
</P>
<P>
 "But as far as 1988 is concerned, I think history proves that not many people 
are ever going to see a year like that, be it Orel Hershiser or anybody else." 
</P>
<P>
 Way before 1988, Hershiser was a star. He won 60 games in his first four 
seasons with the Dodgers and in 1985, was 19-3 with a 2.03 earned-run average. 
By the time 1988 arrived, he had pitched 923 innings. Then he pitched 267 more 
before the postseason. He pitched another 24 in four games against the New York 
Mets, then had two complete-game victories in the World Series against Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course everybody remembers Hershiser. He was on the mound so much. But in 
1990, Hershiser's rubber arm lasted only four starts. By then he had pitched 
another 256 innings during 1989, going 15-15 with a 2.31 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
 He began feeling the pain in his right shoulder. During the spring before the 
1990 season, Hershiser visited Prakash Dalal, a massage therapist in Vero 
Beach, Fla., who specializes in alleviating pain. He helped, but Hershiser's 
shoulder was damaged. Soon after, team orthopedist Frank Jobe was 
reconstructing it with a new surgical method. No one knew if Hershiser would 
pitch again. 
</P>
<P>
 "Orel has been coming to me every spring since," Dalal said, "but this spring 
something phenomenal has happened. He has more velocity and is more fluid, and 
his shoulder feels better then even before he had the discomfort." 
</P>
<P>
 Hershiser spent 90 minutes a day with Dalal for the past four springs. Dalal 
worked on muscles to free his range of motion and improve flexibility. "Orel 
would come to me the day after pitching five innings and I would say, 'How do 
you feel?' And he would say, 'Fantastic,' " Dalal said. "I'm not a pitching 
expert, but I think he has had a major breakthrough. With a little bit of luck 
and help from above, you may see a miracle." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Hershiser will open the Dodgers' 1994 season Tuesday, the fourth time he has 
been so honored. Manager Tom Lasorda loves his Bulldog, a nickname Lasorda gave 
him. With a name like Orel, Lasorda figured he had to do something. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that helped him as much as anything," said Orel's father.  
</P>
<P>
 It will be Hershiser's 11th season with the Dodgers, the only remaining player 
from the 1988 World Series team. He is also in the last season of his contract, 
will turn 36 in September, and hopes to be pitching four more years -- with the 
Dodgers. He is one of only eight active major league players who have 10 years 
service with one club. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody says, 'What a great accomplishment,' but I don't know anything 
different," Hershiser said. "So, to say, 'Don't you feel special?' is to say, 
'Don't you feel like Orel Hershiser?' Yes I do. But I'm just fortunate enough 
to experience what I am experiencing." 
</P>
<P>
 But for the first spring since his surgery, Hershiser says he is beginning to 
feel normal. Hershiser has pitched poorly in the three seasons since his 
surgery, but given the circumstances, it has been phenomenal that he pitched at 
all. He has compiled a 29-31 record in 538 innings and 87 starts the past three 
seasons and has led the staff in innings pitched the past two. Overall, he has 
a record of 128-96 with a 2.95 ERA in 322 games and 2,020 innings. 
</P>
<P>
 More importantly, Hershiser says his wife Jamie and sons Quinton (age 10) and 
Jordan (5) have taught him to be more balanced in a life that includes a strong 
religious faith. There are times when Hershiser starts focusing in a couple of 
days before he pitches, and Jamie will remind him that it's too soon. 
</P>
<P>
 "She will say, let me have you another day," Hershiser said. "She and the kids 
have helped me learn how to be all the different type of people I have to be."  
</P>
<P>
 During the 1988 season, Hershiser said he was afraid to let his game face 
down, even when forced to. When Jordan was born in the middle of his scoreless 
inning streak and was in intensive care, Hershiser left the team to be with 
Jamie. But when it was his turn to pitch again, he flew to Houston and threw a 
shutout, one of five consecutive shutouts during his record-setting streak. 
</P>
<P>
 It's those days of greatness that Hershiser is striving to return to, but 
fortunately the crazed fanfare has dulled somewhat. The day before the Dodgers 
left for Florida this spring, Hershiser ate lunch at a small restaurant in 
Pasadena. He found a spot at the counter and sat alone, watching the Winter 
Olympics on television.  
</P>
<P>
 He wasn't there long when Fred Claire, Dodger executive vice president, walked 
in with a few family members. 
</P>
<P>
 "And there's Orel sitting at the counter by himself," Claire said. "And he 
tells me later that when he went home, Jamie and the kids wanted to come back 
that night and eat." 
</P>
<P>
 For Hershiser, life might finally be normal again -- his kind of normal.

GRETZKY DISLIKES HOPELESS FEELING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LISA DILLMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Wayne Gretzky couldn't escape the reality. Now he was just like all those 
other athletes in places such as Winnipeg and Hartford, playing hockey with no 
hope of making the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Fourteen NHL seasons -- nine with the Oilers and five in Los Angeles -- all 
ended with playoff appearances for Gretzky. His flawless record was marred 
Saturday night when the Kings were officially eliminated from the playoff race. 
It was the first time in 24 years that a team failed to make the playoffs the 
season after reaching the Stanley Cup finals. 
</P>
<P>
 For Gretzky and the Kings, 6-1 winners over the Edmonton Oilers on Sunday, the 
bitter sting of missing the playoffs probably won't fully hit them until 
postseason play begins. The Kings (26-41-11) had reached the playoffs seven 
consecutive seasons after missing in 1985-86, when they finished with 54 
points. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're in a sense of denial," said Gretzky, who had three assists. "But like 
I said, we absolutely deserve to be where we are and each guy deserves to be 
held responsible. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "It's an unbelievable feeling. I've never had this feeling. It's ridiculous. I 
don't understand. We're a better hockey team than our record. But there are no 
excuses. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last year, we went to the finals and everybody stood up and took bows -- 
people better stand up and be counted now. Every person in the organization." 
</P>
<P>
 The Kings are 14 points behind the San Jose Sharks and trail the expansion 
Mighty Ducks by four points. Their victory over the Oilers before an announced 
crowd of 10,363 at Arco Arena ended a three-game losing streak. Goaltender Robb 
Stauber made 35 saves and left wing Luc Robitaille scored his 40th goal of the 
season at 12:40 of the second period. Robitaille has scored 40 or more goals 
for eight consecutive seasons, the longest streak among active players. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a lot more fun to play for the team than for individual statistics," 
said Robitaille, who had scored once in his previous nine games. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a strange position for all the Kings. Instead of talking about the 
playoffs, Gretzky was asked whether he would represent Canada in the World 
Championships this month in Italy. He said he will consider the option, but it 
is highly unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd rather be playing (in the playoffs)," he said. "Maybe sometimes it's good 
to experience everything. But it's the worst feeling in the world. I don't know 
if it's good. I hope everyone learns from this." 
</P>
<P>
 The Kings had different reactions to teammate Pat Conacher's outspoken 
comments on Saturday, when he said they "laid down like dogs." Said Gretzky: 
"What you get from Patty's exactly how he plays. An honest effort. He spoke 
from the heart. I don't know exactly what he said, but he probably hit the nail 
on the head." King Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Wayne Gretzky expressed sadness that Dave Taylor's long and outstanding NHL 
career ended ingloriously. Taylor suffered a concussion on Jan. 4 after a 
collision with Warren Rychel and continues to suffer from headaches and 
dizziness. An official retirement announcement is pending. "I think we missed 
Davey a lot," Gretzky said. "His experience in calming down the younger 
players. It's unfortunate he ended his career the way it did -- hit by his own 
teammate." . . . One discontented King fan held up a sign that read: "Quakes, 
Fires, Riots, Kings -- Another Big Catastrophe." 
</P>
<P>
 King Coach Barry Melrose, on the value of off-season workouts: "I'd rather 
have 20 fats guys working hard than 20 guys who look like Greek gods."

ARKANSAS' BIG NASTY LEAVES MARK ON FOES; RAZORBACKS: WILLIAMSON HAS LED HIS 
TEAM TO ITS FIRST APPEARANCE IN THE NCAA CHAMPIONSHIP GAME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS BONK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As far as generating power goes back in his hometown of Russellville, Ark., 
Corliss Williamson probably runs second to the nuclear plant, but there's not 
much on two legs that comes close to matching the Arkansas Razorbacks' 
meltdown-looking-for-a-place-to-happen. 
</P>
<P>
 At the very least, Williamson is tough on his size-17 shoes. He has gone 
through 12 pairs this season. It seems he just can't stop tearing them apart at 
the seams when he plants his feet and makes his moves around the basket. 
</P>
<P>
 Williamson wore the 13th pair Sunday, the same pair he will slip on before he 
walks on the court tonight when Arkansas plays Duke for the NCAA championship. 
</P>
<P>
 It's difficult to say which team is going to win. But if it makes any 
difference, Arkansas clearly has the lead in a couple of possibly key 
categories: snakes and tattoos. 
</P>
<P>
 Williamson is big into both. 
</P>
<P>
 The Razorback players have the snake lead over Duke, six to zero. Corey Beck's 
snake is called "The Truth." Darnell Robinson has two snakes, one named "Big 
Pimpin' " and the other an unnamed albino. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee Wilson's snake is "Sadie" and Roger Crawford has a snake, too, but it 
doesn't have an official name. Williamson calls Crawford's snake "Inch Worm" 
because it's so small. 
</P>
<P>
 Williamson, nicknamed "Big Nasty," owns a python called, naturally, "Little 
Nasty," a six-footer on a two-rat-a-week diet. 
</P>
<P>
 There's nothing quite like the warm, fuzzy feeling you get when your very own 
python is crawling on your arms or when you watch it eat, Williamson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's kind of neat," he said. "It's lots of fun." 
</P>
<P>
 It's been nothing but fun for Williamson and the rest of the Razorbacks as 
they cut a giant swath through the NCAA tournament field and arrived in the 
championship game for the first time in school history. 
</P>
<P>
 The closest they got before was in 1990, when they lost in the semifinals at 
Denver. They lost to Duke. 
</P>
<P>
 Williamson knows it probably will be up to him to make sure he isn't unlucky 
enough to have history repeat itself while he's standing there in shoe pair No. 
13.  
</P>
<P>
 Maybe the tattoos will help. Williamson has two -- his initials on the right 
side of his chest and a Tasmanian Devil on his left side. Robinson's tattoo is 
a ball swishing through a hoop and the word "Tank," his nickname. Wilson has a 
tattoo of Elmer Fudd. No one seems to know why. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyway, it was Williamson who cleared Arizona out of the way in Saturday's 
semifinals with 29 points, 13 rebounds, five assists and two steals. Coach 
Nolan Richardson was impressed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Nasty is every coach's dream," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Richardson probably needed to dream of more Nasty things Sunday night to help 
against Duke. When it was pointed out to him that some have characterized the 
outcome as dependent upon which team plays with the most intelligence, 
Richardson became angry. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who do you think they're talking about?" Richardson said. "Not us." 
</P>
<P>
 Williamson said softly that he is offended by any intimation that the 
Razorbacks aren't smart. 
</P>
<P>
 "I look at it this way," he said. "You've got two guys in a fight and one is 
intelligent and one is dumb and strong. Which one do you think is going to 
win?" 
</P>
<P>
 Richardson leaned back and laughed. "I got to remember that!" he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever Williamson's strengths are in storytelling, it is on the court where 
he dominates most. 
</P>
<P>
 The Southeastern Conference player of the year, Williamson stopped playing 
football in the seventh grade so he could concentrate on basketball. He wears 
No. 34 in honor of former Georgetown star Reggie Williams and wanted to become 
a Hoya, but couldn't resist Richardson's plan to get something big going at 
Arkansas. 
</P>
<P>
 As a freshman, Williamson was injured twice and sat out 13 games, but he still 
averaged 14.6 points for the season and 16 in three NCAA tournament games. 
</P>
<P>
 Williamson led Arkansas in scoring, rebounding and shooting this season as a 
sophomore and has scored at least 20 points 22 times in 33 games. 
</P>
<P>
 He also did it in his own fashion. Williamson shaved his head except for where 
the part would be, then shaved that, too, after Beck called it "too country." 
</P>
<P>
 Williamson is used to getting ribbed by his teammates. When they learned that 
Williamson liked to fish, they started calling him "Jethro." 
</P>
<P>
 Call him anything you want, but "Big Nasty" is a big problem for anyone who 
plays him. Coaches double-team him and Williamson passes the ball skillfully. 
Play him straight up and Williamson's eyes get as wide as "Little Nasty" at 
dinner time. 
</P>
<P>
 Williamson's cousin, Clarence Finley, was the one who gave him the nickname 
"Big Nasty," to describe a powerful, inside big man's game. It sure fits on the 
court. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's my world," Williamson said. "It's my little Fantasyland out there." 
</P>
<P>
 And if you happen to get in the way, "Big Nasty" is liable to turn you into a 
Belgian waffle. Be warned, say the Razorbacks, all snakes and tattoos. They're 
hoping it's a real Nasty day.

IT MIGHT BE RIDING ON THE LANG FACTOR; BLUE DEVILS: WHEN SENIOR FORWARD PLAYS 
WELL, AS HE HAS IN THIS TOURNAMENT, SO DOES DUKE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LONNIE WHITE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Grant Hill may be Duke's undeniable leader, but if history repeats, Antonio 
Lang will determine the Blue Devils' success against Arkansas in tonight's NCAA 
championship game. 
</P>
<P>
 The play of Lang, a 6-foot-8 senior, has been the barometer for Duke all 
season. When he plays well, so do the Blue Devils. When he doesn't, they 
struggle. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you look at the numbers, that's a pretty accurate summary," Lang said. 
"When I play well, we usually win. . . . Everyone on the team just seems to get 
involved more." 
</P>
<P>
 Call it the Lang factor. 
</P>
<P>
 Going into every game, Duke followers know that they can expect 20 points, 
eight rebounds, five assists and a stellar defensive effort from Hill. With 
Lang, however, it is a different story. 
</P>
<P>
 During the regular season, Lang averaged 12.4 points and 5.4 rebounds a game. 
But in the Blue Devils' five losses, he averaged seven and two. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lang factor has been especially true in the NCAA tournament. In five 
postseason games, Lang has averaged 12 points and seven rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Lang's importance to the Blue Devils was never clearer than in Saturday's 
victory over Florida. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first half, Lang had his problems. Not only was he dunked on by 
Florida's Andrew DeClercq, but he scored only four points in 10 minutes due to 
foul trouble as Duke trailed, 39-32, at halftime.  
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't have any flashbacks that this was my last game of my career at 
halftime because I knew we had a lot of time left," Lang said. "But I knew that 
I needed to be out there because I had not played too many minutes in the first 
half." 
</P>
<P>
 Lang played all but two minutes in the second half as he stepped up his game 
in helping the Blue Devils rally from a 13-point second-half deficit. He scored 
eight points and finished with 12 points and five rebounds, but his biggest 
play of the game did not show up in the box score. 
</P>
<P>
 With time running out and Florida trailing by three points, Lang stepped in 
front of a charging Dan Cross at midcourt and drew an offensive foul to clinch 
the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was just a huge, huge play by Tony (Lang)," said Duke center Cherokee 
Parks. "It was clutch for him to step up like that." 
</P>
<P>
 Lang said he knew that Duke had a foul to give before sending Florida to the 
foul line, so he took a chance. 
</P>
<P>
 "It took a lot of courage, but I thought that I had a chance," Lang said. "I 
felt that I had a position, but I didn't know what the ref was going to call 
when I fell to the ground. I'm glad that he saw it my way." 
</P>
<P>
 Coming back to win was only fitting for Lang and Duke's other two seniors, 
Hill and Marty Clark. By reaching tonight's final, they have become a part of 
college history by playing in three national championship games, having played 
on the 1991 and 1992 title teams.  
</P>
<P>
 A victory over Arkansas would put them on the short list of players who have 
won three national titles. The 13 on it now all played for UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 "Making a big play to help us win felt great, not only because it meant 
reaching the championship game," said Lang, who needs only three points tonight 
to reach 1,000 in his career. "But it also meant that we had another chance to 
play again and that is very gratifying." 
</P>
<P>
 Lang, a tri-captain along with Hill and Clark, says that this has been a 
special season for him because of his increased role on the team. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew that we had the talent to reach the championship game when we first 
got together for preseason practice," Lang said. "I just didn't know if we 
would be able to put it all together at the right time. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's what makes this so special, because people did not expect us to do 
much, and now I'm playing a larger role on a team that is only a game away from 
winning it all." 
</P>
<P>
 In order for that to happen, the Blue Devils will have to do a solid job 
matching up with Arkansas' Corliss Williamson, an assignment that might fall to 
Lang. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's so big and strong that we can only hope to slow him down," Lang said. 
"You just can't allow him to get so many good looks near the basket. If he does 
that, he'll kill you. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know that we can't run with them because their big men run the floor 
better than ours. They have more depth and have better players than anyone 
we've played all season."

BEIJING TO GET LOOK AT IMPORTED CARS; CHINA: COUNTRY'S FIRST SHOWROOM FOR 
FOREIGN MAKES IS SEEN AS KEY TO TURNING THE AUTO INTO A COMMON TOOL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuter 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Beijing's first public showroom for imported cars opens this week, an 
important step in turning the car from a tool of privilege into an ordinary 
commodity. 
</P>
<P>
 The showroom, run by Beijing CIM Automall Co., a subsidiary of the CIM Corp. 
of Hong Kong, will display cars by six foreign makers: Ferrari, Audi, Honda, 
Lancia, Volkswagen and Mitsubishi. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday's opening will have the usual pizazz of motor marketing, elegant 
women draped over gleaming new cars, a lion dance, speeches by dignitaries and 
dozens of television and still cameras. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want the showroom to be a window for Chinese on the world auto market and 
for foreign makers on the Chinese market," said Philip Yang, general manager of 
Beijing CIM. 
</P>
<P>
 Like other companies, foreign car makers are keenly watching the Chinese 
market but low incomes, a shortage of foreign exchange and limited road space 
have made it a limited market that till now has been strictly controlled. 
</P>
<P>
 For the 45 years of communist rule, imported cars have been a perquisite 
zealously guarded by the authorities and rationed through quotas, permits and 
high taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 A chauffeur-driven ride in an Audi or Nissan limousine or, even better, a 
Mercedes Benz or a BMW, has been a sign of high rank and privilege, not 
something bought with mere money. 
</P>
<P>
 In many government jobs, car privileges have been part of the package, with 
low officials scrambling to put bookings in at the car pool while 
higher-ranking cadres secure exclusive use of their own state vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
 But this is changing, and the showroom is part of this change. The government 
wants to make cars more like other commodities, so people can buy them if they 
have the money without elaborate approval procedures, which have been widely 
abused. 
</P>
<P>
 The Materials Ministry announced earlier this year seven policies aimed at 
encouraging individuals to buy cars with their own money, and reducing illegal 
purchases by bureaucrats using public money. 
</P>
<P>
 An official for the production section of the China National Auto Industry 
Corp. said it had become easier for individuals to buy locally made cars, with 
only money and an introduction letter from a company or work-unit needed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Buying an imported car remains more difficult and needs a license. But it is 
easier now than it was one or two years ago," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 To normalize the market, the government on Jan. 1 lopped 70 percentage points 
off car import tariffs, leaving large models taxable at 150% and small and 
medium-sized models taxable at 110%. 
</P>
<P>
 While this still means that an imported Toyota can cost more than $50,000, it 
marked an important step toward making such cars more affordable. 
</P>
<P>
 Beijing also dropped a concession that enabled Sino-foreign joint ventures to 
bring in imported cars tax-free, a privilege widely abused by businessmen who 
often set up joint ventures solely for the purpose of using their car quotas. 
</P>
<P>
 An official of a Japanese car maker said that, in line with its application to 
rejoin the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), China is cutting the 
import tariffs and the paperwork needed to buy imported cars. 
</P>
<P>
 "But China is still short of foreign exchange, which means that it cannot 
liberalize the market completely," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Official figures show ownership of passenger cars in China at 1.2 million at 
the end of 1993, 70% of them imports, most used actually or nominally for 
business. 
</P>
<P>
 China produced 1.31 million motor vehicles in 1993, up 22.8% from 1992, of 
which 234,000 were cars. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year China officially imported 310,000 cars, up from 210,000 in 1992, 
with an enormous number smuggled in. 
</P>
<P>
 Beijing taxi drivers say that a smuggled car can be bought, complete with the 
necessary official forms, at a considerable discount from the price of a legal 
import and that officials are often involved in the racket. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason car ownership in China is less than 1/10 of the world average is 
that prices are more than double world levels while incomes are a fraction of 
the world average. 
</P>
<P>
 The average urban resident in 1993 earned $270, although incomes in major 
cities are several times higher, while a small number of people earn tens of 
thousands of yuan -- or thousands of U. S. dollars -- a year. 
</P>
<P>
 The cheapest local car is the Charade, made under a joint venture with 
Daihatsu of Japan and costing $10,574, while a Santana, made under a joint 
venture with Volkswagen of Germany, costs $18,700. 
</P>
<P>
 An imported Toyota Crown costs $46,000 to $56,500.

 Rosemary Herbert was just wondering. Was that handgun lying next to Patricia 
D. Cornwell's word processor a prop, something a best-selling mystery writer 
might keep around for a little verisimilitude? 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't touch it!" Cornwell boomed when Herbert posed precisely this question. 
"It's loaded!" 
</P>
<P>
 Such are the eccentricities that Herbert encountered while researching "The 
Fatal Art of Entertainment: Interviews With Mystery Writers." 
</P>
<P>
 Just published by G.K. Hall & Co., the book is a collection of conversations 
with well-known sleuthmeisters -- among them, Julian Symons, the 81-year-old 
dean of the genre. 
</P>
<P>
 Herbert, a Harvard University librarian, said the book traces her own passion 
for mysteries, beginning as a child. Her love of intrigue has continued into 
her forthcoming "Oxford Companion to Crime and Mystery Writing." 
</P>
<P>
 Herbert also has written four chapters of her own mystery novel -- set, of all 
places, at Harvard's Widener Library. ELIZABETH MEHREN

 Archeologists have traced the unique bond between man and dog, going back more 
than 10,000 years. But when current civilization is dug up and studied, they 
may decide that New York was one tough place to be a dog. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps in no other city in the nation do urban pressures collide with such 
force on man and beast. The pace and difficulty of daily living, plus the 
closeness of life in many apartment buildings, can turn mere annoyances into 
major traumas. Ordinary rituals taken for granted elsewhere can assume new 
dimensions, magnifying behavior until neurosis walks at both ends of the leash. 
</P>
<P>
 In some drug-infested neighborhoods, dog owners have to pry crack vials from 
their pets' mouths. In other places, dogs must dodge speeding delivery 
bicyclists on sidewalks and deal with over-friendly strangers who can turn a 
simple stroll into an emotionally charged obstacle course. 
</P>
<P>
 In some co-op apartment buildings, misbehaving dogs can be more than a 
nuisance -- they can be an economic hardship. 
</P>
<P>
 How hard is it to be a dog in New York? It can be a struggle. Dog Vs. Machine 
</P>
<P>
 Each day, a Labrador retriever mix climbed onto the furniture the moment his 
businessman-owner left for the office. Finally, the owner hit upon a scheme: He 
turned up the volume on his answering machine and telephoned home several 
times. "Get off! Get off!" he shouted. 
</P>
<P>
 After a few calls, the dog got off the sofa -- and chewed up the answering 
machine. 
</P>
<P>
 An elderly woman lived with her dog in a large apartment building. Her 
neighbor began complaining that the dog barked all day. Desperate when an 
eviction notice arrived, she hired a trainer, but he found a silent pet. 
Puzzled, the trainer planted a tape recorder in the room and left it with the 
dog. When the tape was played back, scratching sounds were heard -- outside the 
front door. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the neighbor, who wanted to move into the apartment and was scratching 
on the door to provoke the pet. Dog Vs. Sidewalk 
</P>
<P>
 Brian Kilcommons, a dog trainer, took an Afghan hound puppy on its first walk 
in New York. They were soon accosted by a large woman wearing a down coat "who 
looked like the Pillsbury Dough Boy." 
</P>
<P>
 "She was saying, 'It's adorable!' and homing in on the puppy," Kilcommons 
says. "The puppy looked up at this huge thing who was gushing these loud noises 
-- reaching for it -- put its ears up, backed up and thought, 'It is going to 
eat me!' 
</P>
<P>
 "My job is to back people like that off, saying, 'It is his first day out. I 
think he is a little bit frightened. Why don't you just kneel down and let the 
puppy come to you?' When that was done . . . the puppy had a pleasurable 
experience." 
</P>
<P>
 Ed Beckmann, owner of one of the city's largest dog-training schools, 
observes: "New York is a special environment, full of pleasure but also full of 
strain. A dog can soothe the craziness." Dog Vs. Sidewalk II 
</P>
<P>
 "Walking the dog is a major deal," says Elizabeth Elman, an interior designer 
who bought her black cocker spaniel, Velvet, in the suburbs. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a lot of adjusting for the dog. All of a sudden you deal with the 
honking of horns. Eleven people are on the sidewalk. There are 10 different 
dogs sniffing. It's kiss, kiss, kiss every dog. It's not just you go out and 
walk your dog in 10 minutes. It becomes a whole production." Dog Vs. Nature's 
Call 
</P>
<P>
 Horns, sirens and wailing auto alarms often make it a noisy production. One 
golden retriever in Manhattan became so frightened when motorcyclists attending 
drug rehabilitation sessions in a nearby church emerged and roared by, she just 
stood and shook in fear. 
</P>
<P>
 After trial and error, the retriever finally found a quiet alley on a side 
street more to her liking. Dog Vs. Dognapers 
</P>
<P>
 Many owners think twice about leaving their pets tied up outside stores even 
for an instant. The fear: dognaping. 
</P>
<P>
 "Addicts are grabbing dogs that are tied to fire hydrants when someone goes in 
for a bagel or something," says Dr. Mike Marder, a veterinarian in practice in 
Manhattan for almost 30 years.  
</P>
<P>
 "They try to get some sort of ransom or sell the animals. I have had clients 
bring me animals they bought from street people. . . . We attempt to find 
owners if there are any tags. But it is mostly a matter of trying to find a 
foster home." Dog Vs. Co-op Board 
</P>
<P>
 In Manhattan, a pet with poor manners can cause the board of directors of some 
posh cooperative apartment houses to reject an applicant seeking to buy a home. 
</P>
<P>
 In some buildings, dog owners chronically wage war with other apartment 
dwellers over whether pets can ride passenger elevators. A spot on the carpet 
of a hallway outside apartment doors can become a cause celebre . When a puppy 
struggling with housebreaking had an accident just inside the main entrance of 
a Manhattan co-op, a special committee of irate apartment owners met to inspect 
the damage. 
</P>
<P>
 As they muttered and peered at the wet spot, the building's superintendent, 
who owned a dog, diplomatically saved the day. He asked the puppy's owners to 
bypass the front door during walks and to use a side staircase and the delivery 
entrance. 
</P>
<P>
 Elevator etiquette can be an art in itself. Riders can stare nastily and 
complain if a dog doesn't sit quietly between floors. Like people, pets in the 
same building have their friends and enemies. A major faux pas is two feuding 
dogs entering the elevator at the same time. The result often is a hair-raising 
ride. Dog Vs. Parent 
</P>
<P>
 In New York, many working owners worry about leaving a dog home alone all day. 
For those able to afford it, professional dog walkers provide daily exercise. 
But guilt accompanies many owners to their jobs. Some people rush home during 
lunch hour to see Max or Muffie. Others phone their answering machines during 
the day with such reassuring messages as, "Mommy loves doggie. Daddy loves 
doggie, too." 
</P>
<P>
 Still other owners record hours of conversation and leave the tape playing 
when they leave the house or turn on the television or radio to an all-news 
station. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite all the attention, some dogs still suffer separation anxiety. 
</P>
<P>
 In a classic case, a cocker spaniel ate his owner's keys, trapping his master 
in the apartment because the man had installed a special security lock 
requiring a key to open the front door from the inside. 
</P>
<P>
 Unable to leave for work, the owner phoned trainer Beckmann in a panic. A 
locksmith was summoned. A veterinarian fished the keys from the spaniel, and 
Beckmann eventually taught the dog to think solitude was pleasurable. 
</P>
<P>
 "We turned it around," the trainer says. "The only way the dog could get his 
favorite chew bone was when the owner left the house. The dog couldn't wait for 
the owner to leave each day, just as teen-agers often can't wait for their 
parents to take off on vacation." Dog Vs. Silence  
</P>
<P>
 Most dogs eventually end up adjusting to the strains of life in New York. They 
become relatively blase on busy streets and ignore sirens and other 
distractions. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no reason a normal, balanced dog that is exposed to all the 
varieties of life in New York City . . . should not become desensitized," says 
Dr. Nicholas Dodman, a professor at the Tufts New England School of Veterinary 
Medicine who is an expert in urban dog behavior.  
</P>
<P>
 "But some city dogs have a hard time in the country. It's too quiet."

'IT'S LIKE A WAR OUT THERE'; TEACHER-NOVELIST GIVES AN ELOQUENT, GRITTY VOICE 
TO THE STRUGGLES OF BLACK YOUTH IN LOS ANGELES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS McLELLAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Growing up in Central Los Angeles in the '70s, Jervey Tervalon managed to 
avoid the burgeoning gang lifestyle. When outside gang members would scale the 
fence at Foshay Junior High School, he and a friend would hide in the ball box 
in the gym. In high school, he and his college-bound friends were interested in 
girls and grades. 
</P>
<P>
 But Tervalon couldn't escape the sometimes tragic fallout of gangs a decade 
later when he taught English at Locke High School on 111th Street, an outpost 
fellow teachers wryly referred to as the "foreign legion." 
</P>
<P>
 One of his students -- "the last kid in the world who would be disrespectful" 
-- was shot to death in a phone booth after basketball practice, a case of 
mistaken identity. Another student suffered a nervous breakdown after his 
cousin was gunned down during a dispute. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was another impressive young man -- polite, hard-working, a good student, 
the kind of guy that if you had him for a son you'd be happy," Tervalon, 35, 
says. "When I saw him starting to crack up, displaying odd behavior that was 
just totally unusual for him -- crying and laughing, causing scenes -- I 
wondered, 'What the hell is going on? It's like a war out there.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Like post-traumatic stress syndrome found in war veterans, Tervalon realized, 
"You're seeing this in kids. Young people are shattered." 
</P>
<P>
 Galvanized by the experience, Tervalon began writing a novel about the 
struggles of black young people in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "Understand This," which Tervalon completed while in the UC Irvine graduate 
program in writing, was published in February by William Morrow. It's a gritty 
tale about the emotional aftershocks that follow a senseless killing. Told from 
eight points of view in alternating chapters that crackle with street argot, 
the novel opens as high school senior Francois Williams sees his best friend, 
Doug, shot and killed by Doug's drug-addict girlfriend minutes after the two 
youths had been throwing a football in the street. 
</P>
<P>
 Francois is numbed by his friend's death; his no-nonsense girlfriend, Margot, 
dismisses his "crying over some . . . woman beater, some wanna-be high roller." 
</P>
<P>
 Six supporting characters -- including Francois' mother and the dead boy's 
brother, sister and girlfriend -- move the narrative forward. There's a 
teacher, Michaels, who resembles Tervalon at the end of his five-year stint at 
Locke in the late '80s, when he was verging on burnout yet felt reluctant to 
move on. 
</P>
<P>
 Tervalon, a Pasadena resident who now teaches a weekly literature class and a 
literary symposium at UC Santa Barbara, calls "Understand This" a novel of 
"voices and perspectives that portray a patchwork reality." 
</P>
<P>
 "I was impressed by Tolstoy's encyclopedic vision of 19th-Century Russia, and 
somehow I hoped to be able to create a novel that would share that kind of 
dynamic, but in the oral traditions that I had grown up with -- creating a 
spoken novel that would reveal the internal lives of these various characters I 
knew. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to see them represented in their complexity instead of seeing them 
reduced to a sociological analysis. I wanted to see their flesh and blood, and 
I found out I could accomplish this by having them speak themselves into 
existence." 
</P>
<P>
 The youngest of four brothers, Tervalon moved to Los Angeles from New Orleans 
when he was 4. Home was in a predominantly black working-class to middle-class 
neighborhood a mile west of the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum where, he says, 
"there was a real sense of community." 
</P>
<P>
 Although his parents -- his father worked for the post office, his mother was 
a key-punch operator -- divorced when he was 10, Tervalon says they were always 
there for him: "My father and mother were avid readers, and they encouraged me 
to go to college." 
</P>
<P>
 At Dorsey High School in the mid-'70s, Tervalon was an honors student who took 
advantage of opportunities from photography classes to flying lessons. There 
also were creative writing classes, in which he wrote poems about love and 
death as well as horror and kung fu stories. 
</P>
<P>
 As a literature major at UC Santa Barbara, Tervalon continued to take writing 
classes. After graduating in 1980, he returned to Los Angeles to teach English 
at Locke. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to teach at an inner-city high school," he says. "I was primarily 
interested in teaching literature to the students because reading was so 
important to me. I thought maybe I could make a difference in their lives." 
</P>
<P>
 The experience also changed his. 
</P>
<P>
 In deciding to write his novel, Tervalon combined his feelings over the death 
of one of his favorite students with the memory of a striking image that had 
haunted him since his high school days: A friend had told him about seeing 
another boy shot in the face by his girlfriend after slapping her in an 
argument in the street. 
</P>
<P>
 "I began wondering what would be the reaction of a kid -- the kind of internal 
dialogue, the psychic repercussions -- of witnessing something like that," 
Tervalon says. 
</P>
<P>
 "We rarely talk about the internal psychology of these kids. We kind of ignore 
it and think only of the external. Sometimes there's fear and depression, but 
you don't see it. You just see the veneer of a kid that's unscarred, but inside 
they're suffering." 
</P>
<P>
 Encouraged by his wife, Gina, a personnel analyst for the city of Los Angeles, 
Tervalon applied to the UC Irvine writing program. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time he started attending the weekly writing workshop, however, 
Tervalon had abandoned "a really bad first draft" of his L.A. novel and was 
writing about his family in New Orleans.  
</P>
<P>
 But in reading his work in progress to the other workshop members, Tervalon -- 
the only black student -- found his dialogue criticized. 
</P>
<P>
 A "well-meaning friend" who told him that his characters "don't talk like 
black people" gave him a copy of a novel that contained what Tervalon 
considered stereotypical "Song of the South"-style black dialogue. 
</P>
<P>
 Motivated to write a novel with characters who talk like the people he knows, 
Tervalon began rewriting his L.A. novel. 
</P>
<P>
 When he began reading passages of the new novel in the workshop, he says, the 
other students "didn't understand a lot of the dialogue, but they liked it. And 
I liked that reaction: They were sort of intimidated by it, so I continued to 
write at a pretty quick pace." 
</P>
<P>
 Through the now-retired Oakley Hall, who taught at Irvine and is founder of 
the Squaw Valley Writers Community, Tervalon's manuscript was given to an 
agent, who sold the book within three weeks.  
</P>
<P>
 Tervalon, who recently completed a one-year screenwriting fellowship at 
Disney's Hollywood Pictures division, has a second novel -- "a fictional family 
history of black L.A. over the last 30 years" -- that's in the hands of his 
agent. And he's well into a third novel about the black community in Santa 
Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd like to put together a body of work that really explores the material of 
black life toward the end of the 20th Century," he says. "I just hope I can 
really utilize the material like Faulkner did -- take the problems and 
complexities of a small community and make them timeless and universal."

'BOSSY, MISS BOSSY' IS NO SOFT TOUCH; ADVICE: HER COLUMN HAS BEEN CALLED A 
HOOT. BUT E. JEAN CARROLL IS HONEST AND STRAIGHT TO THE POINT. HER FORMULA IN 
LETTERS? 'JUST DO IT!' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOAN KELLY BERNARD, NEWSDAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 E. Jean Carroll's readers ought to meet her. In person, the high-spirited 
advice columnist for Elle magazine takes the woman's art of easy rapport to a 
new dimension. Witness her first meeting with an interviewer in the lobby of 
the Algonquin Hotel in Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have great hair!" she exclaimed with charming conviction. "Is it natural? 
. . . Who does it? . . . What does it look like in daylight?" 
</P>
<P>
 Now this is a woman you can sit down and talk to. This former Hoosier beauty 
queen is Everywoman's dream big sister -- ready with tart observations and sage 
advice. 
</P>
<P>
 OK, so even she calls herself "bossy, Miss Bossy," but what better trait for 
someone willing to take on the problems of people of whom she asks, "To what 
depth have they sunk to write to a stranger at a fashion magazine?" 
</P>
<P>
 "It's something about my red corpuscles," says Carroll, whom fans will also 
recognize as the author of "Hunter: The Strange and Savage Life of Hunter S. 
Thompson" (Plume, $12). "I'm very strong in my life. Not to say I'm not riddled 
with flaws of every kind. But I can take on all these problems." 
</P>
<P>
 Her column -- "Ask E. Jean" -- debuted in September in the first revamped 
issue of Elle since Amy Gross took over as editorial director a year ago. Gross 
discovered Carroll (the E stands for Elizabeth) through her regular articles in 
Esquire. ("I do the boys and the girls," says Carroll, whose writing career 
began in 1979 with the rare purchase by Esquire of an unsolicited, humorous 
quiz on Hemingway and Fitzgerald.) 
</P>
<P>
 Gross was struck by Carroll's "way of responding to whoever her subject was. 
It was unprogrammed, warmhearted, funny." And she was "a wild woman beyond the 
inhibitions of normal constraints," Gross says. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ask E. Jean" has been called subversive, a hoot and cheeky hyperbole. One 
male reader recently accused Carroll of "relentless male bashing." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked about that, Carroll owns up to it. "Nobody loves a man better than me," 
she says, but adds: "Sometimes men need to be bashed. More than bashed. But 
sometimes women need to be bashed. We all need to be bashed." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, despite her often-irreverent style, when it comes to serious issues -- 
depression, being HIV positive, sexual harassment -- she is sensitive and 
sensible.  
</P>
<P>
 "I like her on serious topics," says Joyce Gottlieb, a social worker in New 
York City who runs the West Side Mood Disorders Support Group and who agreed to 
review a sample of columns. "She's very good, really on target." 
</P>
<P>
 Having met hundreds of women through the mail, Carroll, 50, has strong general 
words of counsel for them, the short version of which might be: Lighten up and 
fly right. Or left. Or sideways. Whichever way you want. Only fly. What she 
hears too often in female readers, she says, is a fear of life, a fear of 
adventure, a fear of "breaking the parameters." 
</P>
<P>
 "We're screwing up our daughters' education," she says. "Young women today 
don't know what they can do, so they write to me to see what they should do." 
</P>
<P>
 Women are being bred for love and security, she says, and these are such 
natural instincts, you don't need to instill them. What young women need to 
learn is that they are free to follow more than one dream. And if she has one 
formula for answering letters, it is, "Do it! Just do it! No matter what the 
question is, many times that's all they want to hear." 
</P>
<P>
 Her letters and faxes -- she gets at least three dozen a month -- can cover 
anything from a woman incensed over a haircut to graphic sexual quandaries. But 
usually, Carroll says, they fall into three areas: general malaise or confusion 
about what to do in life, career questions and, of course, sex. 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, there's a fourth category, she says: women who have lost their man. "You 
want to shake 'em," she says. "Life is not about guys! I've taken it upon 
myself to explain this. I don't know what the hell it is about, but it's not 
about guys!" 
</P>
<P>
 So don't look to E. Jean for easy answers about finding Mr. Right. 
</P>
<P>
 "Marriage is a prison," she says. "The only reason to get married is 
children." 
</P>
<P>
 Call it a blind spot, but it's not as if she hasn't been there. She has been 
married twice, in each case, to men she still counts as friends. 
</P>
<P>
 She advises women "to become more athletic and strong, to jump, to run, to 
swim, to become physically strong . . . to become mentally vibrant by reading 
the great classics, not watching TV, not reading the National Enquirer. Read 
Tolstoy, Chekhov, Simone de Beauvoir, Jane Austen . . . George Eliot . . . 
something other than Elle, Esquire. . . . Women must read." 
</P>
<P>
 She would also tell them to stop taking themselves so seriously. "I notice 
that people who are really happy do not take themselves so seriously," she 
says. "You can take your work seriously. Your family seriously. But you 
shouldn't take yourself so seriously. Or your boyfriend. You can take your 
husband seriously. I know women who take their boyfriends more seriously than 
themselves!" 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, women should "stop thinking about what they look like." Yes, she 
says, "It's very important how we look. We are judged on how we look. You can 
spend a small percentage of time scheming to be beautiful but not all the time. 
I have seen a brilliant woman who was plain take a whole room on. 
</P>

PRACTICING FOR PARENTHOOD; OK, SO HE WAS WRONG. A DOGGY DADDY DISCOVERS THAT 
HAVING PETS IS A LOT LIKE RAISING KIDS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CRAIG TOMASHOFF, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 So it took my wife and me exactly one week after our honeymoon to participate 
in one of America's great newlywed rituals. We adopted a couple of puppies -- a 
10-week-old female shepherd mix named Kasmir and an 8-week-old male German 
shepherd named Iggy Pup. 
</P>
<P>
 It's like this: A couple gets married. They think they might want children, 
but it's a bit too soon. So why not ease into parenthood by practicing on other 
needy little nippers? 
</P>
<P>
 Before becoming a doggy daddy, I was skeptical of all this. Kids and dogs 
seemed to have very little in common. After all, kids are something you have; 
dogs are something you own. Kids grow up and make enough money to buy you 
stuff; dogs grow up and still expect you to pay for their dinner. 
</P>
<P>
 If you want a child, you have at least nine months to wait after you make your 
decision; if you wake up one morning and want a dog, you can have one in your 
home before dinner time. 
</P>
<P>
 Taking care of a puppy is also quite different from tending to your child. It 
may be necessary to bring in a trainer to teach your pet some discipline. The 
idea of getting a trainer for your baby might not look so good to the 
neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, it's OK to set a little wooden hut, a couple of rawhide bones and a 
big bowl of water in your back yard and leave your dog out there all day while 
you're at work. This is a somewhat less socially -- and legally -- acceptable 
thing to do with your child. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Now that I am a proud puppy papa, my views have changed. All the above are 
still true, but they pale in comparison to the ways in which owning dogs really 
is a dry run for having children. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, judging from what I've learned from friends who have become 
parents, having kids totally disrupts your daily routine. Life is no longer 
about "me," it's about "us." It's the same deal with dogs. Every night must be 
spent at home bonding with the family unit. Every day must be spent thinking 
about getting home to bond with the family unit. 
</P>
<P>
 These days, it's matinee movies and takeout dinners. And even if we do go out 
for an evening, it generally isn't much fun because we spend every minute 
wanting to call home and check on the dogs. Too bad they have yet to learn how 
to answer the phone. 
</P>
<P>
 Even when we're not home playing with the pups, we're talking about them. Any 
conversation I have eventually comes around to describing the cute faces they 
made when I scratched their bellies that morning or the horrors of 
housebreaking. Kind of like the way a new parent can't wait to tell you his or 
her child's first words or the first time the babe slept through the night. 
</P>
<P>
 And you know the way new moms and dads seem to bond in the park on Saturday 
afternoon? Well, being a dog owner similarly changes your social circle. The 
only difference is you stand in a park for hours on a Saturday afternoon 
conversing freely about breeds and bowel movements instead of preschools and 
bowel movements. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there's the way the pups slowly start turning you into your parents. 
Suddenly, you have to be the one dishing out the very sort of discipline you 
hated to receive as a child. Lately I've found myself telling the dogs such 
things as, "Stop tracking mud into the house" and "No treats until you finish 
your dinner." 
</P>
<P>
 As if they're going to listen to what I'm saying. 
</P>
<P>
 Adding to the whole parent-child relationship is the sibling rivalry that has 
erupted between our dogs and the two cats, which have pretty much had the run 
of the house for years and aren't too happy to have a couple of stepdogs moving 
in. 
</P>
<P>
 Whenever they're in the house together, the dogs chase the cats. The cats slap 
at the dogs. A major ruckus ensues. Then they all come running to Daddy for 
protection from each other. 
</P>
<P>
 I end up scolding them all with some time-honored parental retort like, "You 
wait until your mommy gets home!" 
</P>
<P>
 It's frightening. Driving a paneled station wagon and voting Republican can't 
be far behind. 
</P>
<P>
 But at least now I sympathize with friends who complain that being a parent 
has left them feeling tired all the time. Dogs wear you out, not only 
physically but emotionally as well. As with a child, you become attached for 
life from the first moment you clutch that warm little body to your chest. For 
better and for worse. In our case, it was the latter. 
</P>
<P>
 Both dogs were taken from a pound, and little Iggy Pup acquired a bad cough 
there. Then he developed parvo, a virus that ate away at his stomach lining. 
After four days in the hospital, he came home only to contract an upper 
respiratory infection.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 There were more vet visits, special diets and even a trip to a pet herbalist. 
We were willing to do anything to save our little guy. But just when he seemed 
to be on the mend, he passed away. This was less than a month after we'd 
brought him into the family. 
</P>
<P>
 On a calendar, that isn't much time to get to know anyone or anything. In the 
heart, it was a lifetime. Since he died, I've talked to people who can't 
understand why we'd still be mourning the death of something that has now been 
dead for a longer period of time than we knew him. It's not like he was your 
kid, they say. 
</P>
<P>
 But he was. Anything that requires your constant care and attention, that pays 
you back simply with a pair of happy eyes and unconditional devotion is your 
offspring. Losing that connection is something you never completely get over. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, it's easier to deal with the loss of a dog. You can simply go out 
and get a new one right away to fill up that hole in your life. 
</P>
<P>
 That's how we ended up adopting Stax (named for Otis Redding's record label), 
a beautiful and very healthy year-old vizsla. She's already stepped in to 
become Daddy's new little girl. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon Stax and Kasmir (named for the dog Mohammed allowed into Paradise) will 
be all grown up, and before we know it, they'll be off to obedience school. 
They'll prefer seeing their friends to hanging out with us. They'll want to 
stay up past their bedtime. And what do I say when our little girls start 
bringing home their new boyfriends, Pete the Pit Bull and Ratso the Rottweiler, 
for Dad's approval?

SCR TO STAGE ITS 1ST WORK BY U.S. BLACK; THEATER: CHERYL L. WEST'S 'JAR THE 
FLOOR' WILL OPEN IN NOVEMBER; 1994-95 SEASON LINEUP ALSO INCLUDES SEVERAL 
CLASSICS.

 South Coast Repertory's 31st season will include the company's first 
production ever of a work by a black American playwright, "Jar the Floor" by 
Cheryl L. West, in addition to the world premiere of a new work by Craig Lucas. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1994-95 Mainstage season will open with Tennessee Williams' "A Streetcar 
Named Desire" Sept. 9 to Oct. 9, theater officials said. In addition to "Jar 
the Floor," the Second Stage season will feature the world premiere of "Wit," 
the first work by playwright Margaret Edson. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jar the Floor," now in its West Coast premiere run on the Cassius Carter 
Stage at San Diego's Old Globe Theatre, throws four generations of black women 
together in a battle between mothers and daughters. West, 37, is an emerging 
voice with several plays under her belt; her first, "Before It Hits Home," 
which examines AIDS within a black family, has been optioned by filmmaker Spike 
Lee. 
</P>
<P>
 Artistic director Martin Benson said that "Jar the Floor" was already being 
considered when The Times noted in February that Orange County's largest 
professional theater company had never staged a play by a black American 
playwright in its 30-year history. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't choose plays based on the ethnicity of the authors," Benson said. He 
added, however, that the article did spur discussion on whether the 
Tony-winning troupe had done enough to solicit submissions from black American 
playwrights. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jar the Floor" will run Nov. 4 to Dec. 4 on the Second Stage, with previews 
beginning Nov. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Additionally, "A Christmas Carol" will return to the Mainstage in December. 
Further productions will be announced in about a month, Benson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The world premiere of Craig Lucas' "God's Heart" marks the resumption of a 
productive relationship between the playwright and the company. Past 
associations have included world premieres of "Three Postcards" and "Prelude to 
a Kiss," which went on to Broadway and a Hollywood movie. 
</P>
<P>
 "God's Heart" was developed in conjunction with SCR, but the playwright turned 
down a commission on the play, according to Benson: "He said, 'Consider this 
play yours. I'm writing it for you guys.' " It is described in press materials 
as a "sweeping commentary on urban life." Previews of "God's Heart" open Feb. 
24 on the Mainstage, and the play closes Feb. 24. 
</P>
<P>
 "Wit" is the first play by Margaret Edson, who teaches English as a second 
language at an elementary school in Washington. The play is about a professor 
who faces a consuming illness. It was developed through SCR's Collaboration 
Laboratory, and received a reading at SCR last November. 
</P>
<P>
 Previews of "Wit" will open on the Second Stage March 14, and it will continue 
through April 16, 1995. Edson has already received a commission from SCR to 
write another play. 
</P>
<P>
 Benson will direct "Streetcar," which he also directed for the company in 
1968. "It just seemed time to do it again," he said, adding that he considers 
one of the two greatest American plays, along with Arthur Miller's "Death of a 
Salesman." 
</P>
<P>
 Under consideration for remaining slots on the Mainstage season are 
SCR-commissioned plays still under development, including works by Donald 
Margulies, Eric Overmyer and David Henry Hwang. Other possibilities include 
"The Country Wife" by William Wycherley, Anton Chekhov's "The Cherry Orchard," 
Noel Coward's "Blithe Spirit" and Alan Ayckbourn's "Intimate Exchanges." 
</P>
<P>
 Works that may appear on the Second Stage in 1994-95 include David Mamet's 
controversial "Oleanna," A.R. Gurney's "Later Life" and the world premiere of 
Cecilia Fannon's "Green Icebergs," which will receive a reading at SCR on May 
2.

'HOUSE OF SPIRITS' FAILS TO LEVITATE; MOVIES: THE STAR-STUDDED FILM DOES POORLY 
IN ITS U.S. OPENING, DESPITE HEAVY PUBLICITY AND STRONG EUROPEAN SALES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 "The House of the Spirits" opened in U.S. theaters Friday boasting tantalizing 
star power, $55 million in European ticket sales and a plot based on the 
popular South American novel of the same name. 
</P>
<P>
 But, today, "Spirits" may be decidedly lower. In its first weekend, the movie 
drew a poor $1.8 million at the box office at about 470 theaters. That is a 
disappointment for a movie that rode in on a wave of publicity with great 
expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 Although there were many favorable reviews, most were not enthusiastic. And 
many negative reviews were withering. 
</P>
<P>
 The film also generated a renewed protest from Latino actors in Los Angeles 
over the issue of non-Latinos playing roles that call for Latin characters. 
</P>
<P>
 The $25-million production shot in Portugal and Denmark is based on Isabel 
Allende's novel covering several generations of a powerful family in an unnamed 
South American nation. The lead roles of the aristocracy are played by Jeremy 
Irons, Glenn Close, Meryl Streep, Winona Ryder and Vanessa Redgrave -- all 
non-Latinos. The two major working-class roles are played by the cast's two 
best-known Latinos, Spanish actor Antonio Banderas and actress Maria Conchita 
Alonso. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'The House of the Spirits' is not a big deal. But the film is a part of a 
trend that is starting not to look good," said Radames Soto, a producer with 
Blue Pearl Development in New York City, which also manages Latin talent. His 
current project in production is a syndicated series, "Hispanic Americans: The 
New Frontier," hosted by Latino actor Jimmy Smits. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just think it makes sense to start developing the kinds of stars who will 
attract the Hispanic audience . . . it's the fast-growing segment of the 
country," Soto added. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look, Al Pacino is becoming the hardest working Hispanic actor who isn't 
Hispanic," Soto said, noting that among other Latino roles, Pacino, of Italian 
heritage, is soon to play Manuel Noriega, the deposed strongman of Panama, in 
Oliver Stone's "Noriega."  
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, a newly formed coalition of Latinos in Los Angeles and Orange 
counties named Luchador Chicanos distributed leaflets to moviegoers in 
Westwood, Hollywood and Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
 Actor and protest organizer Del Zamora said that if non-Latino stars continue 
to take roles of Latino characters, "we will boycott all of their films." 
</P>
<P>
 "I understand the frustration of the actors who want to work," said Harvey 
Weinstein, the co-chairman of the movie's American distributor, Miramax Films. 
"In the ideal situation, we probably should have cast all Chilean actors. But 
where would it stop? These people were the best actors for the part." 
("Spirits" author Allende is of Chilean descent and the niece of that nation's 
former president, Salvador Allende, who was deposed by the military.) 
</P>
<P>
 "We're the wrong company for them to protest," Weinstein said, noting that 
Miramax has distributed many Latin-made films, including those by Pedro 
Almodovar and the Mexican-made hit "Like Water for Chocolate." 
</P>
<P>
 Weinstein, who came in on the project seven years ago when it was still at 
Warner Bros., said the production was a "labor of love." "The cast worked for a 
fraction of their normal salaries. They believed in the material, and I 
personally won't stand for them being treated like this. When they (the 
protesters) say they should look Latin -- what is looking Latin?" 
</P>
<P>
 Weinstein said if it weren't for the German producers Bernd Eichinger and 
Constantin Film and Danish director Bille August's ("Pelle the Conqueror") 
persistence, the film wouldn't have been made.  
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Miramax's New York offices, faced with hugely negative reviews that 
came from England a couple of weeks ago, took out an advertisement last week in 
the New York Times on the day before American reviews appeared to quote 
Allende's enthusiastic reaction to the movie as "the best review of all." 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview Friday, Weinstein said: "That ad was just to tell the people 
who read the book that you can't do nine hours to (adapt the book). Bille 
August chose three themes from the book: love, power and forgiveness." 
</P>
<P>
 The London Daily Mail's headline had called the film "the star-studded fiasco 
from hell." 
</P>
<P>
 England, however, has been the exception so far in foreign reaction. A 
spokesman for the producer said the reception was especially favorable in 
Germany and other nations on the Continent. Indeed, it is unusual for a major 
movie to arrive in the United States with a gross of $55 million already under 
its belt and openings in Australia, Japan and South America still to come.

HOWARD ROSENBERG: FOX LOOKS INSIDE 'SOUTH CENTRAL' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOWARD ROSENBERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Nothing gets me going like the smell of gunpowder in the morning," young 
Tasha Mosley tells her mother after a pre-breakfast walk through their Crenshaw 
District neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 And nothing on television quite gets going like "South Central," the bracing, 
heroically good half-hour series premiering Tuesday night on Fox. 
</P>
<P>
 Mingling dark comedy with dark drama, upbeats with downbeats, "South Central" 
is about a black family facing the challenges of living in a section of Los 
Angeles made globally famous -- and, some would argue, indelibly stereotyped -- 
by riots in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Single mother Joan Mosley (Tina Lifford) is sinking from the middle class into 
poverty after being laid off from a responsible school job she held for 13 
years, a piece of misfortune she's hiding from her three kids. 
</P>
<P>
 Out of money and credit, she's tenaciously fighting for the survival of 
6-year-old Deion (Keith Mbulo), loquacious Tasha (Tasha Scott) and increasingly 
rebellious Andre, or "Dre" (Larenz Tate), her teen-age son who appears drawn to 
the gangbanging that killed his older brother. 
</P>
<P>
 "South Central" is comically incorrect. Out of step with the present wave of 
half hours in prime time, it seamlessly couples mirth and heartache while 
foregoing cheap one-liners in favor of unforced humor that flows from reality. 
</P>
<P>
 It can be very funny, then abruptly lower the boom -- as when Joan, trying to 
hide her embarrassment, is forced to put back her groceries when she can't 
produce the cash to pay for them at the neighborhood co-op where she bounced 
her last check. The scene is devastating; Lifford's acting memorable. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor does "South Central" have its characters graciously turn the other cheek. 
When learning in episode two that his mother has lost her job, Andre angrily 
snaps: "They always fire the niggers first!" It's a stinging condemnation that 
resonates the hostility of many blacks toward a system they believe is racist. 
</P>
<P>
 There is something sociologically rigid about "South Central." As in last 
year's admirable HBO miniseries, "Laurel Avenue," once again on television we 
have a black family associated with an underclass whose calling cards are crime 
and violence. The familiar checklist in "South Central" also includes an 
absentee father and a single mother trying to shield her brood from the 
surrounding blight of poverty, gangs and, of course, drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 When Andre wants to start carrying a beeper, a trademark of criminals in the 
'hood, his mother forbids it, fearing the Los Angeles Police Department will 
take him for a drug dealer or a gangbanger. "Why not just carry a sign: 'I'm 
young, I'm black, I'm stupid, shoot me.' " 
</P>
<P>
 And when an older drug-dealing friend gives Andre a wad of cash in the second 
episode, his mother explodes again and tries to flush it down the toilet. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, the Mosleys of "South Central" are no more typical of black 
families than the Conners of ABC's "Roseanne" are of white ones. Yet, like the 
Conners, they do depict with intelligence and sensitivity a segment of America 
that exists and, incidentally, one that is otherwise just about invisible on 
weekly series in prime time. 
</P>
<P>
 You don't see it in "Sister, Sister," the just-premiered ABC comedy about 
black twin sisters living an upper-middle-class teenhood with their respective 
adoptive parents. Nor in "704 Houser," Norman Lear's new comedy about a 
middle-class black couple -- and their conservative son -- who live in the same 
house that bigoted Archie Bunker and his family once occupied. It arrives on 
CBS next Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In particular, "South Central" rises above the spreading minstrelization of 
blacks on much of television, from the "Waz-up?" and "bitch" monologues of 
HBO's popular "Def Comedy Jam" where black performers can be seen defining 
themselves largely by their libidos, to Fox's "In Living Color," 
crotch-grabbing "Martin" and "Living Single," which spreads the word that 
college-educated black females with good jobs act like idiots. 
</P>
<P>
 In shrewdly staking out the young and the hip as its core audience, while 
coloring its bottom line ebony, Fox has rolled out whole conveyor belts of 
black-tilted comedy series, the best of which -- prior to "South Central" -- 
was "Roc," whose working-class protagonist has always had a certain dignity. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of these shows, though, are as monotonously stereotypical in their own 
way as the widely repudiated "Amos 'n' Andy" was generations ago. In fact, the 
gap between the new and old stereotypes is not all that wide. 
</P>
<P>
 "South Central," on the other hand, is a highly worthy addition to prime time. 
Created by Ralph Farquhar, who is black, and Michael J. Weithorn, who is white, 
it was acquired by Fox only after CBS dropped it from development, perhaps 
envisioning something breezier and less pungent than the smell of gunpowder in 
the morning. Their refusal to compromise is a credit to them both. 
</P>
<P>
 * "South Central" premieres Tuesday at 8:30 p.m. on KTTV-TV Channel 11.  
</P>
<P>
 * FIRST EPISODE CRITICIZED: Show lacks strong males, say groups who oppose 
"South Central." F10

O.C. POP MUSIC REVIEW; DR. JOHN FINDS THE OLD MEDICINE STILL EFFECTIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL KOHLHAASE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was the same old hoodoo Friday night at the Coach House when Dr. John 
shuffled his way on and off the stage. Those hoping that John (a.k.a. Mac 
Rebennack) would focus on his new, funked-up recording "Television" might as 
well have stayed home channel surfing. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the good doctor's first set covered the usual ground, with only a few 
surprises. Yes, he did the new album's title tune, a too-much-sex lament ("Out 
the bedroom/it's all null and void/Be cheaper to sleep with Sigmund Froid/How 
come we never watch television?"). And he gave Berry Gordy's "Money (That's 
What I Want)," also from "Television," a perfunctory treatment. But all in all, 
this was generic John. 
</P>
<P>
 And that was just fine with the sold-out audience, who heartily welcomed 
everything from his trademark opener "Iko Iko" to his encore, Leadbelly's 
"Goodnight Irene." It may not have been his most polished performance -- he 
jumped into the vocal of "Didn't He Ramble" ahead of the band, then started 
again when they caught up -- but, like all John's concerts, it was alive with 
snakey rhythms, instrumental highlights and fun, fun, fun. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, all right," as John would say after nearly every tune. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, funk took a back seat to jazz during the show, thanks to a 
distinguished three-piece horn section and John's own piano musings. The horns 
-- John's longtime associate Alvin (Red) Tyler on tenor sax, trumpeter Charles 
Miller and baritone saxophonist Ronnie Cuber, whose long list of credits 
includes trombonist Slide Hampton, bandleader Woody Herman and saxophonist Lee 
Konitz -- seemed to compete for attention as they dropped references from one 
jazz standard after another into the improvisations. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Cuber especially was adept at allusion, with most of his drops being pulled 
from "Porgy and Bess" ("Summertime," "It Ain't Necessarily So"). Tyler at one 
point played several lines from "Nature Boy," and Miller appropriately inserted 
veiled hints of "When the Saints Go Marchin' In" during "Didn't He Ramble." 
</P>
<P>
 John's most involved moments at the keyboard came during Duke Ellington's "In 
a Sentimental Mood," and he delivered "My Buddy" with a sweet, jazz-ballad 
approach, colored by mellow choruses from the horns. Overall, his trademark, 
barrel-house piano style was rich with bluesy embellishments and punctual 
chordal play that stepped aggressively to the band's rhythmic marches. 
</P>
<P>
 Dressed conservatively in dark shirt, tweed jacket and beret, the doctor 
sauntered out from behind the keyboard and strapped on a guitar for "Wang Dang 
Doodle" (John began his career as a session guitarist, recording with Joe Tex 
and Professor Longhair, among others). His chop-a-block solo, as twisted as a 
bayou waterway, reached a dynamic climax as the horn section came riffing in 
from behind. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, all right. 
</P>
<P>
 At the heart of the rhythm section was drummer Herman Ernest III, whose cymbal 
decorations and clipped pacing kept the beat wonderfully off-center. His 
strength during the funkier numbers left one wondering what he would have done 
with such tunes as "Spaceship Relationship" or Sly Stone's "Thank You 
(Fallentin Me Be Mice Elf Again)" from the beat-minded "Television" program. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Weighed against the album, John's live performance underlined his strengths. 
"Television" relies too much on funky, almost commercial rhythms, and the 
backbeat becomes a bit tedious as the 11-tune collection progresses. By the 
time the recording reaches the halfway mark with Rebennack's "Shut D Fonk Up," 
the listener can't help but wish that John would take his own advice. 
</P>
<P>
 John's wide embrace of blues, jazz and traditional New Orleans sounds, as 
aired at the Coach House, makes for a varied and interesting program. Still, 
with such a wealth of material at his fingertips, he shouldn't rely on the same 
old numbers. 
</P>
<P>
 But he definitely should continue to educate audiences, as he does with his 
between-number pattter. His tale of how Leadbelly was sprung from jail on the 
strength of his composition "Goodnight Irene" caused at least one youthful fan 
in the audience to ask, "Who's Leadbelly?" Now that's a question worth 
pursuing.

POP MUSIC REVIEW; SPRING'S TRIP IS JUST DOWN IRONY LANE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE BOEHM, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One of the local rock scene's chief exponents of earnest,hippie-days sincerity 
went on stage Friday night and played a set fraught with ironies. 
</P>
<P>
 An April Fools' joke? Not quite. The irony was unintended as Trip the Spring 
was forced to dig up older, folk-oriented material at the Fullerton Hofbrau for 
a semi-unplugged set quite at odds with the new, more aggressive tack that the 
band from Fullerton says it wants to pursue. 
</P>
<P>
 The change in style resulted, a few months back, in the departure of Liana 
Dutton, whose flute playing and harmony singing were large parts of Trip the 
Spring's appeal. In a recent interview, she professed no hard feelings for her 
old band, which includes her cousins Kevin and David Dutton. She has started a 
new, folk-oriented band, Frogneck, with Gary Williams, former singer-guitarist 
with Wood and Smoke. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, singer Kevin, drummer David and Trip guitarist John Kraus came to 
the Hofbrau aiming to rock ahead in their new direction, but wound up playing 
it Liana's folkie way after their capable bassist, Mark Yorst, unaccountably 
went AWOL before the show. 
</P>
<P>
 The 40-minute set mustered by the bass-less Trip the Spring proved that it 
never hurts to have a good grounding in the folkie stuff, even if a band's 
collective heart is set on rocking (see the illustrious careers of Neil Young, 
Bob Dylan and Richard Thompson). If Trip was flustered, it didn't show during 
an enjoyable performance that generally was well-played. 
</P>
<P>
 One key question facing the band is how well Kevin Dutton can carry on without 
his cousin's harmony support. In the past, his reedy, declamatory vocal style, 
which falls somewhere between Ian Anderson of Jethro Tull and Rush's Geddy Lee, 
has been an acquired taste at best, at least when left to its own devices. 
Paired with Liana, something would click and Kevin would join in an alluring 
harmony blend of sweet and rough ingredients. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Hofbrau, his theatrical style seemed less brittle and took on a warmer 
cast as he sang songs steeped in nature imagery and a plaintive romanticism. 
"I'm Lonely" was a highlight, a wistful, bittersweet lament that called to mind 
some of Cat Stevens' work circa the 1970 album "Mona Bone Jakon." A new song, 
"Long Yellow Weeds," is a sunny, relaxed evocation of an escape into the 
pleasures of nature and good ale. 
</P>

 Kraus, a versatile guitarist, struck heraldic, Tull-like chords during the 
dramatic "Mowgli" (after the hero of Rudyard Kipling's "The Jungle Book") and 
put a country twang into some of the more easygoing numbers. David Dutton had 
more trouble making the adjustment to mellow; although he played with brushes 
rather than sticks, the beat was harder and stiffer than the musical setting 
warranted.

 Trip the Spring got outside help from Shon Sullivan, a member of Moonwash 
Symphony who stepped up as a last-minute volunteer to fill out the rhythm on an 
upright piano that happened to be at hand. The piano, a fixture on the 
Hofbrau's stage, wasn't amplified well enough to make a large impact but 
Sullivan, who plays guitar in Moonwash, fit in with good musical intuition. 
</P>
<P>
 Sullivan's assist underscored the collegial nature of the evening. Trip the 
Spring, Moonwash Symphony and the other band on the bill, Room to Roam, are 
part of a five-band cooperative called Homespun that is preparing a compilation 
CD showcasing three songs by each band (also involved are Plato's Stepchildren 
and Moe's Art). The concert was the last in a series by the participating bands 
to raise money for the project. Steven Lamprinos, Homespun's point man, said 
the $500 raised Friday completes the budget and makes it possible to proceed 
with final mastering and production. He expects a late-May release of the 
album, "Homespun: A Compilation of Fullerton Artists." 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 In their own sets, Room to Roam and Moonwash Symphony seemed like two bands 
holding a missing piece of each other's puzzle. 
</P>
<P>
 Room to Roam gave a heartily rambunctious performance replete with '60s 
hard-rock influences. Jimi Hendrix loomed especially large as the band's two 
singer-guitarists, brothers Paul and Pat Gallagher, wailed away freely on their 
instruments and let fly with vocals from the bark-it-out school of rock 
singing. 
</P>
<P>
 The sound isn't exactly distinctive, but Room to Roam does cover a lot of 
ground with its combination of good influences and solid songwriting instincts. 
Among the highlights were "Police," an urgent, bluesy brew of ingredients from 
Hendrix and Cream, and "Jane Rides," a spooky evocation of mysterious, 
bump-in-the-night doings. "Sun" introduced a dense, swirling space-rock sound 
out of the early Pink Floyd archive. 
</P>
<P>
 While Room to Roam has a good handle on how to write a song, its chief flaw 
Friday was a rhythm section that frequently lost the handle on the beat. 
Drummer Joel McDaniel's busy, circling patterns called to mind the swarming 
styles of Ginger Baker and Mitch Mitchell. But those hall-of-fame British 
bashers both made sure that they kept time along with everything else; 
McDaniel's pulse was as skittish and fluttery as the heartbeat of a frightened 
squirrel. * 
</P>
<P>
 Also, Baker and Mitchell played in trios (Cream and the Jimi Hendrix 
Experience, respectively), which left room for their activist rhythms. As a 
foursome with two interlocking lead guitars, Room to Roam hardly needs such 
rampant drumming. What it does need is a more sure and solid underpinning for 
its sound. 
</P>
<P>
 Room to Roam could use some of the precision and attention to detail that 
Moonwash Symphony brought to bear. On the other hand, Moonwash's approach was 
far too careful and introverted. This band could use a shot of Room to Roam's 
go-for-it spirit. 
</P>
<P>
 Usually a foursome, Moonwash played as a drums-bass-guitar trio in the absence 
of its percussionist. Maybe that accounted for the thinness of some of the 
arrangements, which sounded unfinished at times. Or maybe it was just the 
inability of front man Sullivan or bassist Karen Middlebrook to invest the 
performance with the spark and drama that might get their music across. 
</P>
<P>
 The band's diverse material was uneven, but some of it is strong enough to be 
worth an effort to shed inhibitions and magnify the passions in the music. 
"Silver Motown Blues" is winsome and airy, conveying rambling motion along with 
a parade of feelings that flickers in quick succession through the pretty 
chorus. "White Horse," its polar opposite, is a dark, threatening piece 
hammered out with a two-bass attack. A concluding pass at Dave Mason's "Feelin' 
Alright?" drew dancers onto the floor, but this attempt at R&B was an 
ill-advised washout. Moonwash Symphony just didn't project enough personality 
to be convincingly funky.

JAZZ REVIEW; A QUIET EVENING WITH ART OF SAX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL KOHLHAASE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Art of Sax is a soft-core jazz band, the kind that infuses cozy beats and 
vocals with come-hither sax solos to establish a mood as soft as candlelight. 
Call it PG-13 jazz. 
</P>
<P>
 Though there were times during the quintet's first show that something a 
little more racy seemed called for, AOS was perfect for the hand-holding, 
knee-fondling couples who cluttered Randell's Saturday night. But for those 
looking for stronger musical stimulation, the band came across as impotent. 
</P>
<P>
 Miles Davis' comment about the music used in movies to back sex scenes seems 
appropriate: "I don't want to hear violins. I want to hear drums!" 
</P>
<P>
 To that, we can add "minor keys" (not every tune needs to carry a happy face) 
and "aggression" (we're not talking sex, now). It's OK to be laid-back here and 
there, but the real pace of life calls for music that moves as well as grooves. 
AOS certainly had the groove, but its musical drive seemed, well, repressed. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe Commercial Art of Sax would be a better moniker. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The group certainly has its attractive qualities. Saxophonist Will Donato 
plays with a fine ear for melodism on both alto and tenor, and he knows how to 
work with a rhythmic hook. Keyboardist Carlos Murguia was adept at sharp, 
rhythmic accompaniment, especially when pulled from Randell's resident Hammond 
organ. Bruce Conte's creamy guitar tones, often reminiscent of Carlos 
Santana's, blended nicely into the gooey mix, and drummer Steve Monreal has a 
nice way of gliding with the rhythm while adding substance with tom-tom and 
cymbal fills. 
</P>
<P>
 But it's bassist Ed Reddick who brings a bit of punch to AOS' music. Reddick 
is the rhythmic anchor of the band, and his sharply cut foundations went a long 
way toward supporting the "lite" material. He also is a fine vocalist, with a 
sweet falsetto he used to embellish otherwise predictable themes. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The band opened with the easy-listening pace of "Every Generation," then upped 
the tempo with "Soul Searchin' " the title tune from its current CD. The number 
included some decent vocal harmony from Reddick, Murguia and Monreal (who, like 
Madonna, uses a voice microphone strapped to his head, rather than one 
suspended over his drum kit). But the overly pleasant song was as unsatisfying 
as a vegetable burger, largely because any trace of soul was missing. 
</P>
<P>
 The group covered a Kenny G tune with some success, and Reddick's vocal on 
"I'll Be Around" (the Spinners' hit from 1972) made for one of the evening's 
better moments. Donato stirred up some excitement during "Europa" when he 
dropped into the audience to slow dance with one of the patrons while 
continuing to play his alto. But the majority of the group's presentation was 
colorless, as one tune faded predictably into the next. 
</P>
<P>
 Art of Sax should toughen up its sound a bit, maybe by spending some time with 
George Clinton, or by thinking of nails rather than marshmallows during 
performances. The first set sounded as if no one in the band ever had a broken 
heart or a heated affair. 
</P>
<P>
 C'mon, guys. Next time let's get physical.

COMMUNITY GROUPS OBJECT TO VIEW OF 'SOUTH CENTRAL'; TELEVISION: AFTER A 
SCREENING OF THE FIRST EPISODE, CRITICS SAY IT PERPETUATES NEGATIVE IMAGES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG BRAXTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Members of several community groups blasted the first episode of Fox's "South 
Central" series, saying the show lacks strong male characters, features 
inappropriate language and perpetuates negative images of life in South Central 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The complaints erupted following a screening last Thursday at 20th Century Fox 
studios that was hosted by the show's creators, Michael J. Weithorn and Ralph 
Farquhar. The discussion escalated several times into loud denouncements from 
audience members who said they would tell their friends not to watch the 
premiere Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The fervor of the reaction caught Weithorn and Farquhar by surprise, since 
they have received letters of praise for the episode from Los Angeles Urban 
League Director John Mack, Brotherhood Crusade President Danny Bakewell, 
pastors from the First AME Church and other community leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 "South Central" centers on a single mother (Tina Lifford) struggling to raise 
her three children amid poverty and gangs in riot-torn South Central Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Gloria Gray of the Black Health Services Action Committee said she was 
bothered that the central family in the show had no father figure. The father 
does not live in the home and neither the mother nor the children know his 
whereabouts. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are plenty of fathers in South Central, so why does every story we see 
about the area have the father absent?" Gray said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Other audience members, including members of the Southern Christian Leadership 
Conference, Community Build and the Black Women's Lawyer Assn., complained that 
the show was based too much on negative circumstances. "Why does every show 
have to start with a family in disarray, in crisis?" asked one angry viewer. 
</P>
<P>
 Other invitees accused the producers of not doing enough research in the 
community and protested the teen-age son using the word bitch while watching a 
television program. They also criticized a scene in which the son refuses to 
relinquish a beeper to his mother when she demanded that he hand it over. 
</P>
<P>
 Farquhar and Weithorn defended the series, saying the audience had seen only 
the first episode and that the story lines and characters would evolve as 
"South Central" continued. But their comments were often drowned out by 
screaming from the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was caught off guard by the intensity of their feelings, but the criticism 
was not unexpected," Weithorn said the following day. "We've known all along 
that it would anger people. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of the people who came to the screening have devoted their lives to the 
furthering of a political agenda, and that is very commendable," he said. "But 
we're not furthering an agenda with this show. We're telling a story about 
people with flaws and warts. That kind of thing is not going to be consistent 
with their agenda."

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES: YOUTH / OPINION; 
'SHE NEVER EATS ANYTHING BUT SALADS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LORI SILBERBERG, Lori Silberberg of Beverly Hills is a senior at the 
University of Michigan. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For the past four years, she's been a secret. I've been trying to discover 
things about her, a little at a time. But everything I learn is accompanied by 
more questions, more secrets. Why does she get dressed with the door bolted? 
Why does she hide the remains of her salad and run upstairs with it to her 
room? Why does she run the water when she goes to the bathroom?  
</P>
<P>
 She's scaring me. The black circles under her eyes are like the thick clouds 
that darken every winter day. I have seen neither her clear, pale complexion 
nor her sunshine in quite a while. She has the most adorable, slightly crooked 
smile that brightens everyone's day. But she smiles less often these days. 
</P>
<P>
 I compliment her when she wears her hair down, I tell her when a pair of 
Levi's looks great on her. But it doesn't really matter, does it? If she 
doesn't feel good about herself, nothing I say will boost her self-confidence.  
</P>
<P>
 She's got to be starving, she never eats anything but salads drowned in 
fat-free dressing, unsalted pretzels and rice with soy sauce. The amount of 
protein that's in that diet equals the amount of energy that's in her 
personality -- zero. I don't understand how someone so smart can be so 
ignorant.  
</P>
<P>
 I made a choice not to be like her. It was not an easy choice. Every day I 
look at Kate Moss, Elle MacPherson and Naomi Campbell as they plant their 
waif-like frames all over the media. But I resist their taunting. I set my own 
ideal. If my jeans feel tight, I try to lose a few pounds -- that's it. I 
suppose I've always been in control not only of my weight but also of myself. 
This is the choice I've made. 
</P>
<P>
 I make snide comments to her: "Is that all you're eating? . . . You can't 
possibly be full. . . .Hey, trying something new for a change?" (referring to a 
different salad.) If I get a response, it's usually that she isn't hungry. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of my housemates recently confronted her. She laughed throughout the 
conversation, dismissing their concerns by assuring them that she only 
consciously remembers throwing up a few times. What does that mean?  
</P>
<P>
 I feel helpless. Almost five years ago, I experienced the same feeling when my 
brother was diagnosed with viral meningoencephalitis. He could no longer feel 
his legs, remember who the President was or respond to any stimuli. The 
specialists agreed: If he regained consciousness, they doubted he would be able 
to walk again. For three weeks, my family and I communicated with him through 
tender squeezes of the hand. I would ask him if he wanted a new car (squeeze 
once for yes, twice for no.) Then one day I walked into his room and he was 
sitting up in bed, blue tube through his nose, IVs through his arms, and he 
managed a small wave: "Hi, Lor." I cried out of happiness. He had survived 
because he was young and very strong.  
</P>
<P>
 I guess I'm hoping that one day I'll walk into her room and she'll manage a 
big wave: "Hi, Lor." I'll know by her bright eyes and crooked smile that 
everything will be OK.  
</P>
<P>
 But I'm scared that I'll never get to see that big wave. I only have three 
months left before graduation. In three months, my friends and I will be 
scattered across the United States. Who will be there to help her? Her parents 
and sisters choose not to see a problem; they think that she's the strong one.  
</P>
<P>
 Today, she doesn't even have the strength to admit that she's sick. She's 
hidden a 101-degree fever for several days, refusing to rest and sleep. She 
looks horrible; clouds have darkened her face. Now neither of us is in control. 
This is her body rejecting her way of life. I want to grab ahold of her, push 
her face right up to the mirror and scream, "Look at you. What are you doing to 
yourself?" Will it work? 
</P>
<P>
 I don't know. What I do know is that I have three months to make a difference. 
I cannot handle watching her disintegrate. I cannot handle knowing that I 
condoned her disintegration by not doing anything.

AVAZ MARKS THE PERSIAN NEW YEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS PASLES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Quite apart from any artistic considerations, the Avaz International Dance 
Theatre's "Gift of Spring" program, celebrating the 13th and final day of the 
Persian New Year on Saturday, embodied a bond between the Pasadena-based 
international dance troupe and the Iranian community. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking from the stage of the Irvine Barclay Theatre, artistic director 
Anthony Shay introduced many of the pieces, as well as several artists and a 
company supporter in the audience in fluent Farsi, and even ad-libbed in the 
language when the house lights inadvertently flashed on. Some of the non-Farsi 
speakers in the theater were often left in the dark about the jokes, which 
seemed to be richly appreciated. 
</P>
<P>
 Shay talked in English about the community-in-exile, so to speak, coming to 
recognize that the 15-year-old Islamic Revolution was not going to be as 
short-lived as people had thought, and that among other adjustments they had to 
make was how to preserve pre-revolutionary Iranian culture. 
</P>
<P>
 The appearance on the program, then, of the young students of Loghman Adhami's 
Barbad Music Academy took on greater significance than mere entertainment. It 
was exactly the continuity he had hoped for. When the children and Shaw began 
singing the older Iranian National Anthem, the audience rose to its feet. 
</P>
<P>
 In short, this was not your run-of-the-mill dance concert. 
</P>
<P>
 Shay introduced four works on the otherwise familiar program. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tak-navazi" ("Playing Solo") was meant, he said, to expand the notion of art 
dance by bringing together a musician and a dancer to improvise in response to 
each other. Playing the violin, Adhami began a slow, sweetly harsh tune, 
embellishing it with rhythmic figurations. Then Carolyn Krueger glided in on 
tiptoe, executed slow turns and wavy arm movements. But the piece turned out to 
be too short to demonstrate the point. 
</P>
<P>
 The new men's night out at a Greek taverna scene was designed to balance the 
women's witty and ribald harem theater piece, which communicated all but its 
final punch line despite the language barrier. In the Greek piece, five men 
danced together with woozy, virile grace, occasionally letting a soloist emerge 
for virtuosic turns, which included picking up with his teeth a glass of 
whiskey on the floor and drinking the contents. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The statuesque Krueger and Gilberto Melendez also danced a Georgian duet ( 
Kartuli ) in which the challenge, which appeared to be met, was for the man 
never to touch the woman as they swiftly glided close together. 
</P>
<P>
 The last new work was a dance from the town of Bojnurd, in which four women 
and four men, dressed in layered deep-colored costumes, repeatedly clustered 
into and spun out from a central circle. 
</P>
<P>
 They left the stage only to return, holding sticks that they beat 
sword-fashion against each other and against the floor. The easy grace of the 
dance was marred, however, because one of the men looked as if he were learning 
the dance on the spot. 
</P>
<P>
 As usual, the Avaz musicians proved adept at the different styles. Ron Wagner 
was an impressive daireh (frame drum) soloist.
