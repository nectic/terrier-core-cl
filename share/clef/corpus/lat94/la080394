'LEFT-WING FUNDAMENTALISTS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Re "Beware of Democrats' Zealots," Column Right, July 26: Joseph Farah's 
attempt at demonizing the environmental movement is fundamentally flawed. In 
the same way that the religious fundamentalists have been unfairly 
characterized as religious fanatics, Farah wants to package those of us 
concerned with environmental issues as amoral and removed from the mainstream.  
</P>
<P>
 The Farahs of the world would like us to believe that any attempt at nature 
conservancy acts in "compromising and subverting our constitutional right to 
life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness." I fail to see the connection. Does 
the institution of national forests ultimately act to suppress us all? Surely 
most Californians would agree that our reserves are national gemstones that 
create millions in tourist dollars. Farah states that the Desert Protection Act 
will subvert man's right to develop the "barren" desert. The outlying desert 
communities are some of the fastest-growing in the state but with water being 
such an issue here, just how many artificial desert communities can the state 
support? Conserving large tracts of unspoiled desert will only improve the life 
in those existing communities, leaving plenty of room for future development. 
</P>
<P>
 Farah tries to characterize the new environmentalist as an amoral, New Age 
communist holding all the beliefs stereotypically considered liberal 
(personally I'm pro-death-penalty and I eat meat). How wrong he is. We are 
educated, affluent and diverse. We are hikers, hunters, fishers, surfers and 
boaters. We use the resources that California has to offer and want to keep 
them for our children. We believe conservation to be a rational approach in 
balancing development. The days of land rushes and Manifest Destiny are over.

 * In response to Farah's assault on environmental awareness, I would like to 
point out a fatal flaw in his reasoning. Farah assumes that saving animals, 
trees and rocks are an end to themselves, placing human beings (viable or not) 
at the end of consideration. What really is at stake, and perhaps what he most 
objects to, is that humans are not given special consideration. 
</P>
<P>
 Environmentally aware people give equal consideration to all life, including 
human beings. All living things depend on clean air, clean water and healthy 
soil to survive. Animals, trees and rocks are a barometer by which we measure 
the cleanliness and healthiness of these natural resources required for our 
needs. We have to stop wasting resources and learn to share to survive. That is 
the lesson we need to learn as a species in order to live. That is the core of 
environmental awareness. If we all choose to ignore the warnings, then we 
should prepare the children for a future full of disease, famine and heaping 
servings of "Soylent Green."

ST. PHILIP'S CHURCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * I was very disturbed by your article "We Are in the Baby Steps Right Now" 
(special report, The Next Los Angeles, July 17). 
</P>
<P>
 You state that 80% of the parishioners at the Episcopal Church of St. Philip 
the Evangelist are Latino.Though the neighborhood of South-Central Los Angeles 
has changed significantly, with a Latino population of approximately 80%, our 
church is conservatively 65% black. This being the case, it is obvious that the 
church is not being "taken over" by anyone. 
</P>
<P>
 The paragraph here described is not only inaccurate but very destructive. The 
state of human relations in Los Angeles, as elsewhere in the country, is 
complex and painful.  
</P>
<P>
 The church of St. Philip the Evangelist is a model of what can happen in this 
city if people come together with a willingness to learn and grow. There have 
been tensions in the adjustment of becoming a parish that embraces two 
different cultures. No where does this kind of community building happen 
without growing pains. Yet where other groups give into frustrations and each 
retreat into their own corner, after eight years the members of St. Philip's 
continue to learn from their history and to build the inclusive community they 
see themselves called to build.

SMOKING STUDIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * As authors of a study cited in the article published in the recent Philip 
Morris ad, "Were You Misled?" we wish to correct misleading statements about 
our work in the ad. Philip Morris' stated intent was to publicize the "flaws in 
the EPA's use of science" in the EPA report "Respiratory Health Effects of 
Passive Smoking: Lung Cancer and Other Disorders."Evidence presented to support 
Philip Morris' contention relied heavily on one finding of our study of 
exposures to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) which, in fact, was never used 
as evidence in the EPA report. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the only finding from our study cited by EPA was that "42% of 
children 5 years of age and under are estimated to live in households with 
current smokers." Our study did not address respiratory conditions and, 
therefore, was not used as evidence of respiratory damage from ETS. However, 
the EPA report was meticulous in presenting descriptions from other studies 
that demonstrated scientific evidence of the respiratory effects of ETS. Philip 
Morris states, "We believe that both smokers and nonsmokers should consider 
these facts and draw their own conclusions about the issue of secondhand 
smoke." If other studies cited in the EPA report were as "misrepresented" as 
was our study, then the "facts" presented in the Philip Morris ad are highly 
suspect.

WHITEWATER HEARINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * If anyone could watch the Whitewater hearings and not vote against every 
incumbent, I would like to meet him or her. That hearing was one of the most 
disgraceful things I have ever seen.The arrogance of Chairman Henry Gonzalez 
(D-Tex.), the ignorant questions by the Democrats and the inability of the 
Republicans to ask anything of substance, because of the extremely narrow 
parameters of the hearing and the party-line vote to cover up the Foster part 
of the hearings, is despicable. I would like to believe that the general public 
is as disgusted as I am about this situation and would vote against them all, 
but I doubt it. By election time it will be forgotten by most, I'm afraid. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Gonzalez, in trying to look like an able chairman, only looked silly. He 
was fumbling around trying to pretend that everything he said or did was an 
honest interpretation of the rules. Hogwash. He made it up as he went along. 
</P>
<P>
 The day that the public figures out that a democracy should operate on a 
majority rule, not a majority of the largest political party rule, and starts 
voting accordingly, then maybe the country can be saved, if it is not too late.

 The hearings in Washington on the Whitewater investigation are a total sham. 
The powerbrokers who have no regard for the law, only for ways to get around 
it, are making a public farce of our legal system. 
</P>
<P>
 Who is to speak for the right of justice to the American people? Who would 
take our legal system of justice seriously when those entrusted to uphold the 
law so obviously have no desire to find justice within themselves?

WHEN AN APOLOGY MAKES HISTORY; IMPORTANCE OF GERMANY'S GESTURE TO POLAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On Monday, German President Roman Herzog accomplished a transaction between 
two countries that can be difficult even between two estranged friends. In 
Poland on the 50th anniversary of the Warsaw Uprising, Herzog said: "Today, I 
bow down before the fighters of the Warsaw Uprising as before all Polish 
victims of the war. I ask for forgiveness for what has been done to you by 
Germans." Herzog did not go as far as politically possible. He went as far as 
humanly necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 The whole world knows the difference between "I am sorry for what I did" and 
"I am sorry you feel as you do"; between "I did wrong" and "I made mistakes," 
and, perhaps most important, between "Please forgive me" and "Let bygones be 
bygones." Different cultures have different rituals for the profound and 
necessary human transaction that is apology and forgiveness, but all know when 
the ritual has been performed and when it has been omitted. 
</P>
<P>
 Polish President Lech Walesa was wise not to defer to the feelings of those 
who thought no German should be in attendance on this occasion. "We do not give 
absolution to the murderers in Warsaw," Walesa said, "but we do not pass those 
feelings upon the German nation." If Walesa had fallen short of his own 
difficult standard, if he had not invited Herzog, this anniversary could have 
been just one in an endless parade. Courage made it historic. 
</P>
<P>
 Some have wondered whether the moral authority of Germany's presidency would 
be buried with the admired Richard von Weizsacker, its last incumbent. Perhaps 
a few in Germany have even wished for this outcome. How often must Germany 
apologize? they have wondered. Where will it end? The list of any nation's sins 
is potentially endless, and as the Psalmist cries: "If thou, Lord, shouldest 
mark iniquities, O Lord, who shall stand?" But some iniquities require the 
marking, and the slaughter that followed the Warsaw Uprising is surely one. 
Herzog has proved himself Von Weizsacker's worthy successor. 
</P>
<P>
 His words in Warsaw will not be the last German words about the war, perhaps 
not even the last German apology. But in a sense the spotlight is now 
elsewhere. When will a Japanese Herzog go to Nanking and beg forgiveness of the 
Chinese "for what was done to you by Japanese"? On the difficult path of 
national truth-telling, Germany has clearly gone much further than Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 As for Russia, defeated, perhaps, but unrepentant of Stalin's sins abroad, it 
has yet to take the first steps. President Boris Yeltsin stayed home from 
Warsaw. His representative was no major Cabinet officer but only Sergei 
Filatov, his chief of staff, who made a lame, evasive speech. 
</P>
<P>
 Americans, untouched at home by the war, cannot feel these moments quite as 
Europeans and Asians do, but the hope aroused is a world hope, and we too share 
it.

POLICE CORPS GETS MUGGED; OH SO CLOSE -- BUT SOMEHOW IT STILL DOESN'T EMERGE 
FROM CONGRESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Police Corps was a great idea when it was first proposed in 1982, and 
every year thereafter; it was still a great idea last month, when politicians 
shot it down again. 
</P>
<P>
 Latest episode in the long-running saga: the Police Corps was approved in 
concept in the omnibus federal crime bill passed last week, but there were no 
funds in the $30.2-billion measure that were earmarked for it. In Washington, 
this means close, but no cigar. 
</P>
<P>
 This is truly sad. Politics tripped up this exciting and wholly reasonable 
idea for injecting 80,000 energetic young men and women into local police 
departments by offering them college scholarships in return for four years of 
service in local police departments. 
</P>
<P>
 In Washington these days, competition for funding is fierce because of the 
budget-cap system -- and a bipartisan reluctance, especially in a congressional 
election year, to raise taxes. That strictly limits spending. The House-Senate 
conference committee had watered down the appropriation to a theoretical $100 
million over five years. But even if that amount had been real money, it would 
have translated into perhaps 1,000 participants -- too few good men and women 
to spread around the nation. California would probably have gotten a mere 50 or 
60 participants for the entire state. When it comes up for funding next year, 
this worthy plan needs to be done right -- meaning federal funds for 20,000 
students in every college class and 80,000 participants at any given time. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, there is no guarantee that Congress will approve this needed 
program. Some members, most notably Rep. Jack Brooks (D-Texas), the powerful 
chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, simply can't buy the idea of 
providing all this money for young kids to work as cops, in return for 
scholarships, when veteran cops are underpaid and underequipped. The latter 
point is fair enough, but the comparison is apples to oranges. The police corps 
idea would deal with one set of problems by invigorating police departments 
throughout the nation with young energy and talent. And that, among other 
things, is very much worth doing.

NEIGHBORHOOD WATCH; TOO CLOSE FOR COMFORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Learning how to get along with the neighbors can be a delicate matter in 
Southern California as people try to live together in increasingly close 
quarters. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Orange County community of Aliso Viejo, residents waited for months 
this year while the foul smells emanating from one apartment grew 
stronger.Finally, officials were summoned, and found 51 dogs and cats in a 
three-bedroom condo. Six were dead, and 43 more were so sick they had to be put 
to death. The condo owner has since pleaded guilty to charges of cruelty to 
animals. 
</P>
<P>
 In Huntington Harbour, owners of $400,000 homes filed multiple suits against a 
neighbor in small-claims court this week after the city of Huntington Beach 
found a host of housing code violations at her home, including 6-foot-tall 
weeds outside and fire hazards inside. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents in Long Beach and Bay Area communities have used a similar 
small-claims tactic to evict alleged drug users and prostitutes. Several 
neighbors have sued, claiming individual damages of $5,000, the maximum allowed 
in that court. They hope that if each wins, owners will find the penalty so 
expensive they will have to move or evict tenants. 
</P>
<P>
 Serious problem obviously require extreme measures; for lesser ones, of 
course, people can rely on the enforcement of municipal housing codes when 
someone lets property run down. Common sense and patience, sometimes aided by 
trained mediators, can help neighbors walk the thin line between being a 
responsible neighbor and just being nosy.

A CITADEL OF RESISTANCE; MILITARY SCHOOL FIGHTS THE IDEA OF WOMEN CADETS EVERY 
STEP OF THE WAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 All the federal military academies, including West Point, have woman cadets. 
And this fall, if a federal judge has his way, so will the Citadel, the famous 
all-male military college in Charleston, S.C. But the tradition-bound school is 
fighting this every step of the way -- and its struggle not only makes for 
interesting reading, it also poses interesting issues. 
</P>
<P>
 The first is where Shannon Faulkner, 19, should bunk. Cadets are ordinarily 
assigned to the barracks, but not the Citadel's first woman cadet: She is to 
get special housing in the infirmary, where the entry doors can only be locked 
from the outside, by school authorities. She still needs a lock on the door to 
her room in the infirmary -- one that she can lock from the inside. 
</P>
<P>
 Interestingly, U.S. District Judge C. Weston Houck, who last month ordered 
Faulkner admitted, doesn't quarrel with the school's request to house Faulkner 
separately; but the lock matter is up to the school. Some measure of security 
is needed to protect the young woman -- and indeed the college -- given the 
level of hostility toward Faulkner on campus and the recent death threat 
against her.  
</P>
<P>
 The judge, as if making every effort to help the school ease itself into the 
20th Century, also ruled that the Citadel could subject Faulkner to the ritual 
10-second haircut by the college barber that all first-year cadets receive. 
</P>
<P>
 The final decision on the haircut rests with the college. The Citadel should 
follow the lead of the federal military academies, including West Point, which 
allow women to have collar-length haircuts when admitted. 
</P>
<P>
 It's obvious that the Citadel, which receives state aid and thus taxpayer 
money, is a painful example of an institution having a hard time adopting to 
modern notions of gender equality. The Citadel needs to rise to the occasion. 
Judge Houck has ruled that the Citadel's all-male admission policy is 
unconstitutional. The college, while appealing his ruling, is developing a 
remedial admissions plan. If that plan is also ruled unconstitutional, the 
Citadel will be required to admit more women in the fall of 1995. It should do 
so gracefully.

A WAR ANNIVERSARY HARD TO CELEBRATE; THE A-BOMB: THE VALOR OF U.S. TROOPS IN 
EUROPE AND THE PACIFIC IS AN AWKWARD BACKDROP FOR THE NUCLEAR HOLOCAUST WE 
INFLICTED ON CIVILIAN HIROSHIMA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG MITCHELL, Greg Mitchell, of Nyack, N.Y., is writing a book with Robert 
Jay Lifton about the impact of the Hiroshima bomb on America, to be published 
by G.P. Putnam's next year. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 America is in a commemorative mood. The D-Day ceremonies captured the 
attention of the entire nation. Soon we will mark the 50th anniversary of many 
other World War II milestones, from the fall of Berlin to the liberation of the 
concentration camps. The U.S. military's sweep across the Pacific will be 
memorialized at Leyte Gulf and the Philippines, on Iwo Jima and Okinawa. But 
these occasions, unlike those related to the war against Hitler, will be 
haunted by awareness of what comes next: Hiroshima and Nagasaki. 
</P>
<P>
 The stories of the American soldiers who invaded Normandy were supremely 
moving. There were tens of thousands of these GIs; they fought with unreliable, 
low-tech weapons, aimed only at soldiers on the other side. 
</P>
<P>
 Now consider Hiroshima: one bomb, one plane, 100,000 civilians dead. It will 
be interesting to see what America -- the media, the President, the average 
citizen -- makes of this contrast next August. 
</P>
<P>
 The truth is, America has never come to terms with the atomic bombings, so a 
few painful days of soul-searching is not only desirable, it's unavoidable. It 
will be a time for taking stock, for reflecting on the fact that half a century 
ago something revolutionary happened and it changed everything. No matter what 
we think of Hiroshima, it has affected us deeply. 
</P>
<P>
 This wrenching re-examination, in fact, has already begun. 
</P>
<P>
 For years, technicians at the National Air and Space Museum have been 
reassembling the Enola Gay, the plane that dropped the bomb over Hiroshima. 
Next year, they will finally put the front section of the B-29 on display. To 
its credit, the Smithsonian Institution (which runs the museum) plans a 
comprehensive exhibit that includes the bomb victims. 
</P>
<P>
 The Enola Gay exhibit will feature a Ground Zero room, reproducing a wasteland 
of rubble, ruins and heat-fused material. This is the Hiroshima landscape 
familiar to most Americans, and generally it upsets no one; among other things, 
it testifies to the success of the mission. Butthis Ground Zero goes a step 
further, including in the panorama charred bodies and items belonging to dead 
schoolchildren. 
</P>
<P>
 The show hasn't even opened and already it's drawing flak, proof of how raw 
the wound remains. A group of Air Force veterans has seen a copy of the 
proposal for the show and is "feeling nuked," as Hugh Sidey tastelessly put it 
in Time magazine not long ago. The veterans complain that the exhibit pays more 
attention to Japanese casualties at Hiroshima than to Japanese atrocities 
earlier in the war. The Air Force Assn. charges that it is "a slap in the face 
to all Americans who fought in World War II" and "treats Japan and the U.S. as 
if their participation in the war were morally equivalent." Sen. Nancy 
Kassebaum (R-Kans.) sent a letter to the Smithsonian calling the exhibit (which 
no one has seen yet) "a travesty." 
</P>
<P>
 Smithsonian officials respond diplomatically, explaining that the treatment of 
the atomic bombing would be "objective" and make no judgment on the morality of 
the decision to drop the bomb. The two curators are annoyed, however. One, Tom 
Crouch, asserts that critics of the exhibit have a "reluctance to really tell 
the whole story. They want to stop the story when the bomb leaves the bomb 
bay." 
</P>
<P>
 This repeats a pattern established early on. American officials wanted to keep 
the human side of Hiroshima hidden. They minimized radiation effects and 
obscured the extent and identity of the casualties -- the vast majority of them 
women and children. (President Truman's initial announcement referred to 
Hiroshima, a city of more than 300,000, merely as a "military base.") They 
curtailed access to the bombed cities and censored articles and seized 
photographs and film footage that showed the human effects of the bomb. In any 
case, it was a "painless" way to die, said Gen. Leslie Groves, director of the 
Manhattan Project, which built the bomb.  
</P>
<P>
 Suppression was so complete that just months afterward, novelist Mary McCarthy 
was dismissing Hiroshima as "a hole in human history." Thirty years later, 
physicist Ralph Lapp, who worked on the bomb, asked: "If the memory of things 
is to deter, where is that memory? Hiroshima has been taken out of the American 
conscience -- eviscerated, extirpated." 
</P>
<P>
 But there is another reason, besides an approaching anniversary, that 
Hiroshima has special resonance right now. 
</P>
<P>
 Since last December, the Energy Department, prompted by an award-winning 
newspaper series, has released thousands of documents revealing shocking 
details about the U.S. government's radiation experiments. Among other things, 
hospital patients were injected with plutonium without their permission, and 
radiation was deliberately released from nuclear plants. Energy Secretary Hazel 
O'Leary has promised a full investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 But why should we be surprised by a horror story related to our nearly 50-year 
experience with nuclear energy? Secrecy, reckless endangerment and death were 
there from the beginning -- even before Hiroshima. While developing the bomb, 
the Manhattan Project simultaneously began hideous medical experiments on 
unsuspecting civilians. Thousands more also were exposed to hazardous levels of 
radiation while working on the project. When the bomb was tested in the New 
Mexico desert in July, 1945, project leaders feared that a radioactive cloud 
might sail over populated areas, but they rejected evacuation plans. (Fallout 
would indeed drift a hundred miles downwind.) 
</P>
<P>
 Experimentation and subterfuge have played a major role in America's nuclear 
program ever since. For decades, this would have severe implications for 
workers in the nuclear power and nuclear weapons industries, for residents of 
communities adjoining those installations, for soldiers and civilians subjected 
to dangerous fallout from nuclear tests.  
</P>
<P>
 Rather than going too far, the Smithsonian's Enola Gay exhibit doesn't go 
quite far enough. To really convey the impact of the first atomic bomb, it 
should include another display, this one called America Ground Zero. There we'd 
find atomic soldiers and nuclear workers, medical guinea pigs and down-winders 
-- the legacy of Hiroshima.

PERSPECTIVE ON IMMIGRATION; WHO'S ON THE DOLE? IT'S NOT ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS; 
TALKS OF IMMIGRANTS ON 'WELFARE'IS POLITICS; REFUGEES AND THE ELDERLY ARE THE 
BIGGEST USERS OF PUBLIC ASSISTANCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL FIX and JEFFREY S. PASSEL, Michael Fix and Jeffrey S. Passel, senior 
analysts at the Urban Institute, are co-authors of its new study, Immigration 
and Immigrants: Setting the Record Straight. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Few areas of public policy provoke such charged responses as welfare and 
immigration. Not surprisingly, when the two are joined -- as they have been by 
proposals to curb both illegal and legal immigrants' access to public benefits 
-- the public debate is driven by stereotypes and emotions and not hard facts. 
</P>
<P>
 Each of the major welfare-reform plans includes a proposal to limit immigrant 
access to public benefits, though they differ dramatically in their reach and 
severity. The Clinton Administration's plan, for example, would limit some 
legal immigrants' eligibility for food stamps, Aid to Families with Dependent 
Children and Supplemental Security Income for five years after arrival. 
Immigrants whose sponsors (typically family members) earn more than the 
national average would not be eligible until they become naturalized citizens 
(at the earliest, five years after arrival). Immigrant eligibility for Medicaid 
would be largely unchanged. A proposed Republican alternative is more 
far-reaching, barring all non-citizens' access to 61 federal programs, ranging 
from immunizations to school lunches and AFDC, until they become citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 One thing that all of these welfare proposals have in common is that they 
represent a departure from a major thrust of immigration policy over the past 
decade. That is, they go beyond seeking to restrict the rights and privileges 
of illegal immigrants to changing the rules for legal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 This would be a significant change in public policy, one that needs to be 
thought through and not simply enacted as a back-door way to fund welfare 
reform or as an expression of frustration with immigration policy. Why? Because 
these policies blur the sharp and legitimate distinction that has been drawn 
over the past 15 years between illegal and legal immigrants. If legal 
immigrants' rights are restricted in a wholesale manner, the changes would 
reduce this large population to second-class status, taxing immigrants without 
allowing them access to benefits for which they have paid and putting out of 
reach public benefits and services (immunizations, job training) that would 
contribute to the integration that immigrants have achieved in the past. 
</P>
<P>
 Support for these proposals reflects a range of concerns: a straightforward 
interest in finding the money to finance welfare reform; reducing the supposed 
"welfare lure" for illegal immigration; frustration over the scale of 
immigration and the purportedly declining quality and values of immigrants 
(who, it is argued, now both need and are willing to accept welfare), and 
anxiety about the cultural shifts to which high levels of immigration give 
rise. 
</P>
<P>
 These proposals also spring from a broadly held assumption that immigrants are 
heavy users of welfare and are far more likely to be dependent on public 
assistance than natives. How sound is this assumption? 
</P>
<P>
 Viewed generally, immigrants do appear to use more welfare than natives. The 
1990 Census reveals that 4.7% of immigrants receive welfare (cash transfers 
defined as AFDC, SSI or state general assistance) versus 4.2% of natives. But 
go beneath these numbers and examine different immigrant groups and it becomes 
clear that poor immigrants are less likely to use welfare than poor natives. 
Further, welfare use is concentrated among two immigrant subpopulations: 
refugees and the elderly. 
</P>
<P>
 Refugees are the only immigrant group broadly entitled to benefits upon their 
arrival. This entitlement acknowledges that refugees are fleeing persecution 
and are likely arrive without jobs or family networks. Over time, their use of 
welfare diminishes. 
</P>
<P>
 For elderly immigrants who recently arrived, SSI in effect represents 
retirement income; for many, it also is their only bridge to health insurance 
-- Medicaid. 
</P>
<P>
 Roughly one-third of elderly immigrants receiving SSI applied for benefits 
shortly after they became eligible (three years after entering the United 
States). The heavy use of benefits among recently arrived elderly immigrants 
has raised concerns that their children are not assuming financial 
responsibility for the parents with whom they have been reunited. 
</P>
<P>
 Once refugees and elderly immigrants on SSI are excluded, the data indicate 
that welfare use among working-age legal immigrants (16 to 65) is low in 
absolute terms (2.7% of such immigrants receive welfare). Although they are 
substantially more likely to be poor, these immigrants are 27% less likely to 
be receiving welfare than natives. 
</P>
<P>
 As for illegal immigrants, there is no solid evidence that they use welfare. 
They are barred from virtually all public benefits (except for emergency 
medical care under Medicaid and some nutrition assistance for pregnant women). 
</P>
<P>
 Given these facts, then, what are some of the considerations that should be at 
the center of current policy debates over the curbing of legal immigrants' 
eligibility for public assistance? These include: 
</P>
<P>
 Fairness. The impact of these curbs would be harshest on the most vulnerable 
immigrant populations -- most notably, the elderly poor. Then there is the 
question: If legal immigrants pay taxes, why shouldn't they be entitled to 
public benefits, as citizens are? On the other hand, the nation's ability to 
admit large numbers of immigrants is premised on a practical assumption that 
the families of legal immigrants -- not the government -- will take 
responsibility for them. 
</P>
<P>
 Cost-shifting to states. If needy immigrants are cut off from federal 
benefits, it is likely that some will be displaced onto state assistance 
programs. The impact of this shift would be forcefully felt in states with 
generous assistance programs, such as California and New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Cost-saving. Linking eligibility for assistance to citizenship provides a 
strong incentive to naturalize. If large numbers do so, the ultimate savings 
may be substantially reduced. 
</P>
<P>
 There is room for reform, to be sure -- reform of the refugee program to 
ensure that refugees escape welfare dependency, and reform of the sponsorship 
requirements imposed on family members of immigrants so that the rules are fair 
to the newcomers, their families and the communities in which they settle. But 
these are complex issues that raise a host of critical questions about 
immigrant policy and about who is and is not a member of this society. Their 
resolution should represent a careful balance of interests and not be a 
fund-driven sideshow in the debate over welfare reform.  
</P>
<P>

visitors. Among sending countries, the Philippines accounts for almost 1 
million foreign-born U.S. residents, second only to Mexico; Vietnam ranks 
third, Korea fifth. The U.S. population is projected to grow from 249 million 
in 1990 to 355 million by 2040; immigrants arriving since 1990 and their 
children will account for two- thirds of the growth. 7.2% of immigrants are 
self-employed; the figure for natives is 7%. Supplemental Security Income (SSI) 
is the only source of income for 77% of the elderly immigrants receiving this 
assistance. 8% of the U.S. population in 1990 was foreign-born; in the 
1870-1920 "open door" era, 15% (about 1 in 7) was foreign-born. Almost half of 
the population of Los Angeles speaks a language other than English in the home.

MOVIE REVIEW; CLEARLY A READY, WILLING AND ABLE 'DANGER'; HARRISON FORD 
THRILLER IS THE BEST CLANCY FILM YET, NOTABLE FOR ITS PLOT AND CHARACTER 
NUANCES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH TURAN, TIMES FILM CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Clear and Present Danger" does more than provide the summer's most satisfying 
movie experience -- which may sound like damning with faint praise, but 
shouldn't. It reaffirms, if reaffirmation is necessary, Harrison Ford's 
position as the most thankfully reliable action star around. 
</P>
<P>
 With those other big-ticket, big-muscle performers (you know who they are), 
it's not known until it's too late whether they've made a feast or a fiasco. 
Ford, by contrast, in searching for an emotional connection even in the 
brawniest of projects, has become as earnestly dependable as the characters he 
plays. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, since "The Empire Strikes Back" in 1980, the actor has been the 
equivalent of a Good Housekeeping seal for the adventure genre, his presence 
guaranteeing an enviable level of professionalism, excitement and involvement 
in the thrillers, from "Witness" to "The Fugitive," that he has appeared in. 
</P>
<P>
 "Clear and Present Danger" is the third Tom Clancy novel about CIA analyst 
Jack Ryan to be adapted to the screen, and the second time Ford, director 
Phillip Noyce, cinematographer Donald M. McAlpine and other key members of the 
cast and crew have been involved, and the practice has been good for everyone. 
This is easily the best and most tightly wound of the Clancy films, notable for 
the intricacy of its plot and the nuances its actors bring to characterization. 
</P>
<P>
 Initial credit for this must go to "Danger's" jerry-built but effective 
script. Three very different writers -- Clancy adaptation veteran Donald 
Stewart, character-sensitive Steven Zaillian ("Schindler's List") and action 
aficionado John Milius -- share screen credit, and against all expectation the 
intelligent result is much closer to synergy than chaos. 
</P>
<P>
 If "Danger" does have a problem, it is that it starts too slowly. Partially 
this is a situation endemic to sequels, where all the familiar subsidiary 
faces, here including Anne Archer as Ryan's wife, Cathy, and James Earl Jones 
as his boss, Adm. James Greer, have to be laboriously reintroduced to a perhaps 
forgetful audience. 
</P>
<P>
 The plot too begins tentatively with a pair of almost simultaneous actions. 
Ryan is unexpectedly thrust into a more active role in the intelligence 
bureaucracy, with new responsibilities that include testifying before Congress 
and even briefing the President. And the first situation he has to deal with is 
the murder at sea of a lifelong friend and political supporter of the chief 
executive. 
</P>
<P>
 When Ryan traces the murders to the infamous Cali Colombia drug cartel, 
President Edward Bennett (Donald Moffat) is incensed. "Drugs pouring into the 
country and the drug dealers think we're powerless," he fumes to National 
Security Adviser James Cutter (Harris Yulin). Isn't it likely, he goes on, that 
the cartel represents "a clear and present danger to the national security of 
the United States," a situation that allows for the commitment of American 
military power? 
</P>
<P>
 Though the expected thing for "Danger" to do at this point is break down into 
a U.S. versus the drug lords scenario, what happens is more subtle. There turns 
out to be not one Colombian adversary but several, not necessarily on good 
terms with each other. And far from a single monolithic American presence, 
there are various power centers with different perspectives and antithetical 
agendas. 
</P>
<P>
 What results is a pleasantly complex story line in which these numerous 
strands, both in Washington and Colombia, twist and turn as they combine and 
recombine in unexpected ways. This classic wheels-within-wheels situation makes 
each succeeding scene in the film just a little bit more tense than the one 
that came before. 
</P>
<P>
 Keeping this complexity involving and fast-moving is director Noyce, assisted 
by the adroit cross cutting of editor Neil Travis, who also handles the rapid 
shifting of scenes between numerous South American locations (all apparently 
photographed in Mexico). The action-set pieces are crackerjack as well, 
especially a complex ambush filmed on a two-football-fields-long set nicknamed 
"The Kill Zone" that required eight full weeks of preparation. 
</P>
<P>
 What is rarer than good action is plausible dialogue and acting, and this is 
"Danger's" key strength. Especially convincing, and especially timely, is the 
film's depiction of how covert operations go down in Washington, how ambitious 
men operate in a world of suggestion and innuendo, and how an ambiguous "the 
course of action I'd suggest is a course of action I can't suggest" can set all 
sorts of mayhem into motion. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only are the key subsidiary characters written in a subtle way, "Danger" 
has cast the parts with unusually capable actors. In this country, Donald 
Moffat makes a most convincing President, alternately affable and arrogant, and 
Henry Czerny and Harris Yulin are equally good as White House apparatchiks. 
</P>
<P>
 In Colombia, Willem Dafoe is an appropriately cool CIA field operative, and 
Portuguese actor Joaquim de Almedia makes a clever and devious opponent. Even 
smaller roles, such as Ann Magnuson as an FBI secretary and veteran Hope Lange 
as a suspicious senator, are perfectly carried out. 
</P>
<P>
 And once again, as in so many films in the past, Harrison Ford and his 
combination of intensity and integrity hold it all together. Capable of 
bringing to life and sympathy a character derided as "a damn Boy Scout" by his 
more cynical adversaries, Ford is an actor who believes his word to the 
audience is a bond guaranteeing the best he has to give. Would there were more 
like him around. 
</P>

MOVIE REVIEW; 'EAT': A FEAST OF FOOD, SEX AND COMEDY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH TURAN, TIMES FILM CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 By all means see "Eat Drink Man Woman," but not on an empty stomach. Filled 
with so many spectacular Chinese dishes it reduces "Like Water for Chocolate" 
to a Pritikin Diet promotion, this wise and rueful romantic comedy about those 
unavoidable human desires, food and sex, looks tasty enough to incite a monk to 
abandon the simple life. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest work from director Ang Lee (who co-wrote with Hui-Ling Wang and 
James Schmaus), "Eat Drink" shares an empathetic sensibility with Lee's 
Oscar-nominated hit, "The Wedding Banquet." A look at the intertwined lives of 
a father and his three live-at-home daughters, this is more than anything a 
personal-scaled film, funny, emotional and compassionate toward the human 
comedy, Taiwan-style. 
</P>
<P>
 For unlike the New York-based "Wedding Banquet," "Eat Drink" is set in Taipei, 
Taiwan's capital, an upscale, up-to-date but rarely seen metropolis where young 
women often have Western names like Sophia and Rachel and are comfortable in 
both miniskirts and Buddhist temples. 
</P>
<P>
 The three beautiful sisters "Eat Drink" is concerned with, however, all have 
traditional Chinese names, because their father, Master Chu ("The Wedding 
Banquet's" father, Sihung Lung), is a believer in the old ways. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A wizardly chef, perhaps the greatest in Taipei, Chu is crusty and brusque but 
a national treasure behind the stove. "Eat Drink" opens with an engaging 
sequence where the great man, chopping, slicing and dicing like a Vegamatic 
gone wild, prepares a series of knockout dishes. 
</P>
<P>
 It looks like the feast of a lifetime (and in fact "Eat Drink" utilized three 
master chefs full-time, plus several consulting food specialists) but Chu does 
this every Sunday for his daughters, who, not surprisingly, are tired of the 
fuss. 
</P>
<P>
 Referring to the meal as "the Sunday dinner torture ritual," they spend most 
of it bickering with each other and their father, who has been a widower for so 
long he can't accept that his children are all grown women. 
</P>
<P>
 The daughters, for their parts, though old enough to be out on their own, stay 
at home partly for financial reasons but also because their desire for 
independence is balanced by the Chinese tradition of filial responsibility, the 
desire to give their father, irritating though he is, the respect and attention 
his position as head of the family merits. 
</P>
<P>
 Most likely to leave first is middle daughter Jia-Chien (Chien-Lien Wu), a 
career-oriented executive with a Taiwanese airline. Still involved sexually 
with an ex-boyfriend but with her eye on a married co-worker (Winston Chao, the 
co-star of "Wedding Banquet"), she is eager to move into an about-to-open 
condominium complex known as the Paris of the East. 
</P>
<P>
 Most likely to be stuck taking care of Chu (and not particularly pleased about 
it) is oldest daughter Jia-Jen (Kuei-Mei Yang), a serious Christian who teaches 
chemistry at an all-boys high school. Still fixated on her long-gone first 
boyfriend, she can't help but notice the school's muscular new volleyball 
coach. 
</P>
<P>
 Not even thinking about romance is Jia-Ning (Yu-Wen Wang), the 20-year-old 
baby of the family who works behind the counter at Wendy's and amuses herself 
by chatting up a co-worker's Dostoevsky-reading boyfriend whose credo is "love 
is suffering." 
</P>
<P>
 As for Chu, when the master chef is not performing emergency "have wok will 
travel" culinary rescues at elaborate hotel banquets, he relaxes by cooking 
tasty lunches for the grade-school daughter of a neighbor (top Taiwanese star 
Sylvia Chang) who is involved in a messy divorce. 
</P>
<P>
 "Eat Drink" cuts back and forth between the daughters' interaction with each 
other, their father and the other men around them, watching with fond but 
clear-eyed sympathy as they cope with the confusions and misapprehensions of 
their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Similar to the Chinese banquet it will make all but the most resolute hungry 
for, "Eat Drink Man Woman" is a leisurely affair, not in any hurry either to 
dole out the amusing surprises writer-director Lee is fond of or to resolve its 
conflicts. 
</P>
<P>
 This is a film that trusts us not to get impatient and also trusts us to 
appreciate the humor and poignancy in its situations without having to be 
force-fed. Though it is only Ang Lee's third feature, it is a strikingly 
confident one, and viewers will be understandably eager for the next course to 
appear.

POP MUSIC REVIEWS; CASH-CROWELL BREAKUP: ADDING BY DIVISION

<TEXT>
<P>
 When a couple divorces, often friends feel forced to take sides. Whose version 
do you buy of their war between the sheets? Who suffered more and who is the 
villain? And, in the more acrimonious cases, who of the two do you stay friends 
with? 
</P>
<P>
 Being a fan shouldn't be confused with being a friend, but it can be a hard 
distinction to make in country music, where artists so often wear their hearts 
on their sleeves and fans feel emotional bonds with them, perhaps equaled only 
by their feelings toward soap opera stars. 
</P>
<P>
 Scarcely has there been a more creative or emotionally revealing couple in 
country music than Rosanne Cash and Rodney Crowell, and the breakup a few years 
ago of their 12-year marriage has yielded a bumper crop of songs about 
dissolution and rebirth. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday night presented a tough choice for their mutual fans: See Crowell at 
the Crazy Horse, or see Cash at the Coach House. Actually, for those with the 
dough for both shows and a willingness to achieve warp factor 9 on the 405, it 
was possible to see both. And what a rich night of pain-inspired music that 
made for. 
</P>
<P>
 It would be tabloid-like at best to speculate on which songs were about whom, 
or to regard their songs as letters to each other (as critics attempted with 
the post-divorce tunes of Richard and Linda Thompson. Some writers even posited 
that one Richard song was about his ex-wife when the actual subject was a 
serial killer.) 
</P>
<P>
 But there was no denying that several of Cash and Crowell's songs are informed 
by their division. And even though several of those songs are about spiritual 
growth and finding oneself anew, one couldn't help being touched by the sad 
question: If two such sensitive, creative people can't make a go of it, what 
hope is there for us mere mortals? 
</P>
<P>
 Crowell's 7 p.m. show at the Crazy Horse fell short of the artistic heights he 
hit there last year when, accompanied only by stellar guitarist John Jorgenson, 
he delivered a loose, intimate, emotional two-hour show at which he introduced 
many of the songs that would become his current "Let the Picture Paint Itself" 
album. 
</P>
<P>
 Where that had seemed like a visit on a front porch, for Crowell this was more 
of a standard performance, which is still exceptional by most measures. He may 
be one of the most healthy-subversive forces in country music, writing songs so 
catchy that they're accepted by radio even while being of artistic depth 
usually foreign to the airwaves. 
</P>
<P>
 He was backed by a new, and hot, five-piece band that included local pedal 
steel player Doug Livingston (usually with Chris Gaffney) in his debut gig with 
Crowell. Livingston and lead guitarist Kenny Vaughn spun off peppery, inventive 
licks throughout the 15-song set.  
</P>
<P>
 Crowell sidestepped some of the stronger songs from "Let the Picture Paint 
Itself," but did perform the title tune, with its message of accepting life as 
it comes, and "Loving You Makes Me Strong," about renewed hopes. 
</P>
<P>
 As usual, he introduced a couple of new numbers. One was about a resilient, 
hard-drinking rodeo rider he'd met in his youth. The other, "Long Enough to 
Change My Mind," was Crowell at his best, melding a catchy hook with a lyric 
that actually catches some of the complexities of being human. 
</P>
<P>
 It's about a relationship the perseveres and grows, though the manner in which 
it occurs is hardly the stuff of romance novels. Indeed, the singer has seen 
the relationship out due to the weight of entropy and his conflicting emotions 
about love and the world: 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes I miss the world out there, so cold, hard and unkind,  
</P>
<P>
 But I've been thinking about leaving long enough to change my mind.  
</P>
<P>
 He also delivered some inspired covers: Buck Owens' "Above and Beyond" and Bob 
Dylan's "Like a Rolling Stone." The moments where time stood still, though, 
were his during ballads "After All This Time" and "Many a Long and Lonesome 
Highway," as lyrical reflection joined with a soaring, aching delivery 
reminiscent of the late Roy Orbison. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 As deep as Crowell went, Cash's quietly stunning show at the Coach House made 
him seem merely a glib tunesmith by comparison. With her last couple of albums, 
she evidently has given up on mainstream country acceptance to forge an 
intensely personal sound of her own. Her songs from last year's "The Wheel" and 
1990's "Interiors" seemed all the more personal Monday in a mood-laden, 
primarily acoustic setting, with her three band members moving freely from 
cello to bongos. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the Broadway show tune "Wouldn't It Be Loverly," from "My Fair Lady," was 
transformed into a moment of introspective grace. Meanwhile, many of Cash's own 
songs seemed so deep, soulful and true that they gave a listener the chills. 
</P>
<P>
 Back when Crowell was producing her records, Cash didn't write many of the 
songs, though ones such as "The Real Me" on 1987's "King's Record Shop" 
revealed an uncompromising artistry. Now, she writes or co-writes all her 
songs, and her skill has crystallized so there's scarcely an unrevealing line 
among them. Similarly, little in her performance seemed less than essential. 
</P>
<P>
 The standout in the set dealt not with the wall between souls but about 
Jerusalem's Western Wall, which she had seen on childhood trips to Israel with 
her parents, Johnny and June Carter Cash. She said she'd been moved by the 
centuries of collective prayers that had been shared with the wall, and in the 
song she pondered: 
</P>
<P>
 I stand by the Western Wall.  
</P>
<P>
 Maybe a little of that wall,  
</P>
<P>
 Stands inside us all. . .  
</P>
<P>
 I don't know if God was ever a man,  
</P>
<P>
 But if she was I think I understand  
</P>
<P>
 Why he chose to break his fall  
</P>
<P>
 By the Western Wall.  
</P>
<P>
 Neither Crowell nor Cash made any reference to the other's being in the 
vicinity. But when one fan at Cash's show called out for the Crowell-penned "I 
Don't Have to Crawl," she curtly responded "I don't either, man," and declined 
to do the song.

 Bomb Suspect: The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms has released 
composite drawings of a suspected serial bomber, one of whose intended victims 
was apparently Robert Iger, the president of ABC Television Network Group. In 
May a package bomb addressed to Iger was discovered by a secretary at the New 
York headquarters of ABC. In late July a parcel bomb addressed to Iger was 
discovered at United Parcel Service in Jackson, Miss. Both were defused without 
incident. "The bomber may be employed, or have expressed a desire to be 
employed in the television or related industry," the bureau said. "It is 
possible that he is someone who has been very vocal against the broadcast media 
in the past."

POP MUSIC REVIEW; HARRY CONNICK JR. TAKES A SWING AT POP AT THE BOWL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS HUNT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Some people are never satisfied. 
</P>
<P>
 Harry Connick Jr. had a lucrative career in full bloom -- leading a swing 
band, crooning vintage romantic songs and playing jazz piano. Suddenly he 
jettisoned all that and detoured into New Orleans-style pop-jazz laced with 
funk and rock. His new album, "She," features his new style, and so did his 
show at the Hollywood Bowl on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 In the two hours plus, there may have been a total of 15 minutes of quality 
music. Connick's talented combo was hardly challenged by his 
middle-of-the-road, surface-skimming hybrid. 
</P>
<P>
 It's more pop than anything else, but there was just enough New Orlean-style 
jazz and funk to make his audience feel that they were being a little daring 
and widening their musical horizons. If there were any real New Orleans jazz 
fans there, they were probably cringing. 
</P>
<P>
 For Connick's fans, though, the show obviously had great entertainment value. 
He won them over with extensive between-songs patter, pouring on the charm and 
plying them with jokes. Connick is more skilled at schmoozing with an audience 
than singing or playing piano. 
</P>
<P>
 Watching this show is particularly tough for fans of the '40s-style music he 
usually performs. Connick is terrific at crooning that great old material, 
sounding much like early Sinatra. Connick's turn into pop music was like Mick 
Jagger doing a set of polkas -- it's not what he does well. 
</P>
<P>
 Connick will probably say he's trying this new style both to satisfy his 
spirit of adventure and to finally play the music he loved growing up in New 
Orleans. That may be true, but there's clearly another element. You can bet 
that lurking behind those noble intentions is a plain old yearning to be a pop 
star. 
</P>
<P>
 Connick has probably gone as far as he can playing in that crooner-swing mode, 
which attracts an older audience that doesn't buy many records. But this new, 
more radio-friendly style appeals to younger, record-buying fans, and could 
make him a pop star. 
</P>
<P>
 Could Connick be the new Barry Manilow? 
</P>
<P>
 * Connick plays tonight at the Open Air Theatre, San Diego State University, 8 
p.m. Tickets are $35 and $27. (619) 594-6947. DENNIS HUNT

POP MUSIC REVIEW; BIG MOUNTAIN MIXES OPTIMISM, SECOND-GENERATION REGGAE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON SNOWDEN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Big Mountain boasts an improbable success story -- a national Top 50 hit 
single with "Touch My Light" for a local label in 1992, followed by a 
chart-topping version of Peter Frampton's "Baby, I Love Your Way" earlier this 
year. The San Diego band's ultimately winning set at the House of Blues on 
Monday showed that it may be developing a new, second-generation approach to 
reggae. 
</P>
<P>
 In Big Mountain's music, the seed planted by Jamaican music and reggae culture 
is filtered through an American perspective. The social themes of the message 
songs Monday revolved around the stealing of land from Native Americans, 
slavery and the border culture -- lead singer Quino reflected his Mexican Irish 
blood by singing in Spanish on several songs.  
</P>
<P>
 The band's solid musicianship should only improve with first-generation 
Jamaican Tony Chin now on guitar, but Big Mountain struggled to balance its 
light pop and serious culture sides. The music could have been more muscular at 
times, and the positive lyrics occasionally veered into the smile-button zone, 
but for all its flaws, Big Mountain worked as a whole. Quino's utter sincerity 
melted down any cynicism so effectively that the final encore of Bob Marley's 
"One Love" was less an obvious choice than an anthem for true believers. 
</P>
<P>
 The key is that these musicians are true believers -- their multiethnic lineup 
is a testament to reggae's unity message, and their positive stance could 
easily connect with younger reggae fans. Stranger things have already happened 
for Big Mountain. DON SNOWDEN

MUSIC REVIEW; GOLABEK SPARKLES IN PIANO QUINTET 'UNDER THE STARS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CARIAGA, TIMES MUSIC WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The parking can be precarious, the sightlines clogged with audience members 
and the summer night air moist and chilly. Still, there are good reasons to 
frequent the John Anson Ford Amphitheatre in this outdoor season. 
</P>
<P>
 First-rate chamber music, for one, courtesy of the Los Angeles Philharmonic, 
as well as its skilled members and some expert guests. On Monday, for the third 
event in the "Chamber Music Under the Stars" series, the guest was the 
prodigious Mona Golabek, who joined Philharmonic players in Dvorak's Piano 
Quintet, Opus 81. 
</P>
<P>
 For intensity and real affection, plus measurably aggressive drive, this 
ensemble -- including violinists Elizabeth Baker and Lyndon Johnston Taylor, 
violist Evan N. Wilson and cellist Gloria Lum -- would be hard to surpass in 
this treasurable work. Individually, each contributed strongly to the fine, 
Dvorakian textures; as a group, they achieved a model give-and-take. 
</P>
<P>
 One could take for granted the technical accomplishments here demanded and 
niceties of style not always delivered by ad-hoc quintets. To this level of 
performance the players added what seemed a genuine love of the piece and a 
consistent regard for each other. 
</P>
<P>
 Golabek remains a pianist who creates performances at once sparkling, songful 
and virtuosic -- and always with little apparent effort. She was the leader 
here, but she led subtly, without grandstanding or muscling, and with abundant 
musical charm. 
</P>
<P>
 Expert pianism also enlightened the first half of the concert, when Gloria 
Cheng joined flutist Janet Ferguson in Poulenc's irresistible but exigent 
Sonata (1957). Granted that this is a showpiece for the flute -- one that 
Ferguson traversed breezily -- the duo produced admirable, balanced ensemble. 
</P>
<P>
 At mid-program, an ensemble consisting of Taylor, Ingrid Chun, Ralph Fielding, 
Ingrid Runde and Lum gave a pleasing run-through to Mozart's C-major String 
Quintet, K. 515.

POLICE SAY MAN KILLS INTRUDER HOLDING KNIFE

 A veteran U.S. Customs inspector shot and killed a knife-wielding neighbor who 
broke into his Pomona mobile home early Tuesday morning, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 George Silva, a senior customs inspector at Terminal Island in Long Beach, 
fired one shot from his .38-caliber revolver at Alex W. Mastoras, 36, who had 
pried open a window in Silva's mobile home and entered shortly after 1:30 a.m., 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The wounded man fled through the window, collapsed outside with a bullet wound 
to the upper torso and died at Pomona Valley Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents of Big's, the trailer park at 1461 W. Mission Blvd. where the 
shooting occurred, said they had been plagued recently by a rash of break-ins. 
The modest, 113-unit park is home to a number of elderly residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Mastoras had lived for the past nine years at the park with his 74-year-old 
mother and ill stepfather, said Shirley Quist, the park's manager. She said 
Mastoras already had been warned to stop his door-to-door forays during which 
he would demand $5 loans from the elderly residents. With his six-foot frame, 
often wearing a black patch over his glass eye, Mastoras was an intimidating 
figure, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The older women were petrified of him," Quist said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other residents said Mastoras would peddle radios, watches, jewelry and even 
food outside a convenience store across the street. Many residents thought 
Mastoras was burglarizing the park's residents, but none caught him in the act, 
Quist said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Mastoras, the dead man's older brother who was at the park Tuesday, did 
not blame Silva for the shooting. He said his brother's problems were caused by 
drug addiction, which made him desperate for money. 
</P>
<P>
 Park residents said Silva, who usually drives a black pickup, did not drive 
his truck home Monday night because of mechanical problems. He was home but his 
truck was not parked in its usual spot underneath the carport, which might have 
led Mastoras to think he was away.

ECONOMIC BALANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * In "It's Welfare Politics vs. Growth Economics" (Commentary, July 7) Robert 
J. Samuelson asserts that elimination of "the least justifiable government 
spending and regulation" is effective use of the economic recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 Are the payments to welfare recipients unjustifiable? 
</P>
<P>
 If politics are to protect the people against hardship, who suffers more: the 
welfare recipients whose subsistence the Administration may eliminate or the 
taxpayers who pay the bill for benefits currently distributed? 
</P>
<P>
 Economic balance should be the Adminstration's goal. A balance that benefits 
all, not just the few. 
</P>
<P>
 Implementing welfare work and occupational education programs are options 
toward this goal. 
</P>
<P>
 Financial aid recipients can provide community services in exchange for funds 
received, services that relieve the tax burden. 
</P>
<P>
 Another alternative: Revise the federal jobs credit to include welfare 
recipients. The incentive tax credit would help employers offset payroll taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 Political aim is to protect all the people from hardship. Equitable policies 
should be on the government agenda.

MARINERS BANG OUT THE ANGELS; BASEBALL: GRIFFEY HITS 37TH HOME RUN, ONE OF FOUR 
BY 'HOME' TEAM AS SEATTLE ROMPS TO 10-2 VICTORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The Seattle Mariners arrived Tuesday afternoon at Anaheim Stadium in an 
absolutely rotten mood. They weren't supposed to be here in the first place 
until their roof started falling in at the Kingdome. Plans of playing in Tacoma 
were abandoned when the Angels protested. And if that wasn't cruel enough, the 
hours of their off-day traveling and playing in an exhibition game in 
Cooperstown, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
 They slowly walked into the visiting clubhouse at Anaheim Stadium, wondering 
how life can possibly get worse, and immediately were taken back by a foul 
odor. The sewer had backed up and was seeping on the clubhouse floor. 
</P>
<P>
 "Beautiful," Mariner right fielder Jay Buhner said, "simply bleeping 
beautiful." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Ken Griffey Jr.: "I think we should bag this and go for a neutral site. 
Let's go to Peoria (Ariz.). They banged us. Let's bang them." 
</P>
<P>
 The Mariners cursed, angrily dressed, stepped onto the field, and unleashed 
all of their vented frustration upon the Angels, pounding them, 10-2, in front 
of 11,478 fans -- the smallest Anaheim Stadium crowd since 1978. 
</P>
<P>
 "We stunk, we played like a bunch of triple-A players," Angel Manager Marcel 
Lachemann angrily said. "It was the worst exhibition of baseball we have put on 
all year, and it will not happen again. 
</P>
<P>
 "We stunk, and I take full responsibility. If I can't get them to play any 
better than that . . . I'm embarrassed, and if they're not embarrassed, it's a 
sad state of affairs." 
</P>
<P>
 Lachemann was particularly upset with starter Phil Leftwich, who was slow 
picking up a Felix Fermin grounder in the fifth inning, and threw the ball 
away. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was not acceptable," Lachemann said. "The only way he should throw the 
ball away is if he has a broken leg." 
</P>
<P>
 The sad part is that the Angels (44-63) could have saved the embarrassment by 
playing elsewhere, but instead, were left wondering how much this series is 
going to cost them. They generated only $68,868 in ticket revenue, and after 
expense figure to make only about $25,000. However, they saved $34,800 in 
expenses from not flying to Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
 Who could blame the Mariners for asking if this really was an improvement over 
triple-A Tacoma? It's not everyday fans and players must listen to the sounds 
of heavy construction throughout the game where the new scoreboard is being 
erected in the upper deck. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've seen just about everything this year," Buhner said. "You ever hear that 
expression, 'you learn something new every day.' Well, every day we see 
something new." 
</P>
<P>
 The Mariners, after all, had only a few ceiling tiles fall down at the 
Kingdome. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels had their entire scoreboard collapse during the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels' biggest concern about this "Ceiling Tile Series," is that their 
fans might turn out to be, well, a bit rambunctious. You see, most of these 
folks never have had the opportunity to have such close seats for a major 
league game and some had never been to a game. 
</P>
<P>
 Who would have imagined the most unruly folks in the place were the Angels 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 There was Bo Jackson getting called out on a third strike in the fourth inning 
and ejected from plate umpire Al Clark. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson became livid. He screamed at Clark, and retreated to the bench. 
</P>
<P>
 Uh-oh, out came a bag full of balls, 17 of which rolled onto the field. Out 
came a box full of sunflower seeds, with perhaps 40 being strewn. Out went 
Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
 In the sixth inning, there was Chili Davis striking out, and shattering the 
bat over his right knee, stalking to the bench. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a hell of a night," Mariner Manager Lou Piniella said, "I've never 
seen Bo Jackson get that mad. And Chili Davis. . . . you got to be strong to do 
that. . . . And Hudler curtsying? 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a little bit of everything." 
</P>
<P>
 It was that kind of game, which included Ken Griffey Jr.'s 37th home run, 
ending the Mariners' seven-game losing streak. Meanwhile, the Mariners' fourth 
and fifth hitters combined for two homers and five RBIs, the Angels' duo 
combined for six strikeouts. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, we'd like to play in a different place, but I can't blame the 
Angels for not wanting to play in Tacoma," Buhner said. "I feel the same way. I 
don't want to play in no triple-A ballpark either.

ANGELS PLAY HOST TO AN INTIMATE CROWD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It was an appropriate setting for this meeting of the American League's 
losingest teams, a couple of clubs down on their luck and virtually homeless. 
</P>
<P>
 The Seattle Mariners, the major league's answer to Chicken Little, are fleeing 
the Kingdome, where the roof is caving in on a season that began with high 
expectations and has deteriorated into yet another exercise in ineptitude. And 
the Angels, intruders in their own ballpark, are running on empty in the shadow 
of the contenders for the dubious title of AL West champion. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe a work stoppage isn't such a bad idea. 
</P>
<P>
 For now, however, the games must go on. But not in Seattle, where a ceiling 
tile might really spoil someone's day. And not in triple-A Tacoma, which might 
have been a more suitable venue for the kind of baseball played by the Mariners 
and Angels, who have lost 17 games between them in the last 12 days. If this 
were English soccer, these two franchises would have been playing in a lower 
division long ago. 
</P>
<P>
 So it was "Batter up," Tuesday night in Anaheim Stadium -- home of Yankee 
fans, Red Sox faithful, Tiger lovers and even an occasional Angel supporter -- 
where a gathering of 11,478 took advantage of the opportunity to buy box seats 
for $6. 
</P>
<P>
 Tickets went on sale Friday morning and reached a total of 6,000 by Tuesday 
afternoon. Angel officials were pleased by the walk-up sales, which pretty much 
filled out the only level open, the field level, between the foul poles. Two 
hours before the game, you could still buy a box seat a few feet beyond first 
or third base and just a dozen rows back from the field. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Aronson, a Red Sox cap pushed back on his forehead, ordered tickets by 
phone on Friday afternoon. He and his wife, Toby, son, Jesse, 15, and daughter, 
Leah, 13, were excited about their seats five rows behind home plate. 
</P>
<P>
 "The kids have never sat this close and they're always saying they can't see 
what's going on when we sit up there," Aronson said, pointing to the vacant 
upper deck. "I wanted them to have the chance to appreciate the game more." 
</P>
<P>
 The Aronsons, who left Boston to live in Riverside eight years ago, admit they 
are among those who have turned Anaheim Stadium into a home away from home for 
teams such as Boston, New York and Detroit and they make no apologies. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard for us to give up the Red Sox because we've rooted for them all our 
lives," Toby Aronson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It makes me mad when I hear the Angels complaining about the fans here 
rooting for other teams," Steve said. "I have the right to root for whoever I 
want. If they want the fans to cheer for them, let them field a good team. I 
think it's the fans who deserve better treatment, not the players." 
</P>
<P>
 The worst news was yet to come, though. The concessionaires elected not to 
open the Cinnamon Shop, home of the Big A's biggest winner, the gooey and 
delicious $2 cinnamon roll. 
</P>
<P>
 Naval Commander Jon Mukri, and his wife, Janet, with four of their six 
children in tow, brought their own supplies -- peanuts and sunflower seeds -- 
for their "foul-ball hunt" from their seats behind the third-base dugout. 
</P>
<P>
 "The kids are ready, but Janet was hoping we'd be under the net," Mukri said. 
"She's worried about her dental work. You don't see many balls up in the cheap 
seats where we usually sit." 
</P>
<P>
 Foul balls, a chance at an autograph or simply a glimpse of a face under a 
batting helmet drew most of Tuesday night's fans to these close-to-the-action 
vantage points. Many were so unfamiliar with their choice seats they didn't 
even know what to do with the ever-present beach balls that appeared. 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, however, they got their money's worth. Ken Griffey Jr. hit his 37th 
home run of the season in the seventh inning. Bo Jackson was ejected in the 
fourth. And Chili Davis broke a bat over his knee. 
</P>
<P>
 Shawnna Seidl, who was in the first row behind the Mariners' on-deck circle, 
came from Rialto with her boyfriend, Jonathon Miller, on an unusual mission. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope there are some big arguments," she said. "I want to hear what they 
really say to the umpires." 
</P>
<P>
 She got half of her wish when plate umpire Al Clark threw out Jackson for 
arguing a called third strike. But Jackson's vocabulary didn't carry the 40 or 
so feet to their seats. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody was screaming so loud, we couldn't hear a thing," Miller said, 
obviously disappointed. 
</P>
<P>
 Oh well, if it was cursing they sought, surely the Angel fans in the vicinity 
had already provided a colorful oration. By the time Jackson was heaving 
baseballs and bags of sunflower seeds onto the field, Seattle led the first 
game of this Adventures in Futility Series, 5-1.

HANSEN COMES THROUGH, LIFTS DODGERS IN 11TH; BASEBALL: HIS PINCH-HIT SINGLE 
DRIVES IN BUTLER FROM SECOND WITH WINNING RUN, 7-6. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It would have been one of those real tough losses, what with the Dodgers 
having failed to score after loading the bases in the ninth inning. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Dodger reserves, with the help of a solid effort by the team's 
relievers, pulled the game out in the 11th inning Tuesday night, beating the 
San Diego Padres, 7-6, before what remained of a crowd of 32,549 at Dodger 
Stadium.  
</P>
<P>
 Dave Hansen, the pinch-hitting hero of last season, was down two strikes with 
two outs in the inning, when he hit a single up the middle against reliever Tim 
Mauser (2-4) to score Brett Butler from second base. The victory increased the 
Dodgers' lead in the National League West to two games over the San Francisco 
Giants. 
</P>
<P>
 "This game can drive you crazy -- just when you think you are in good 
position. . . ." said Manager Tom Lasorda, when asked how he was feeling after 
the ninth inning. "But we battled back, the bench, and don't forget the 
bullpen. This team manufactured runs and stole a lot of bases." 
</P>
<P>
 Butler, batting in the 11th inning, beat out a two-out ground ball that second 
baseman Bip Roberts fielded cleanly. Delino DeShields walked before Hansen came 
up with the big hit.  
</P>
<P>
 But just seconds before Butler was to bat in the ninth inning, a fan ran to 
the batter's box, with these profound words for Butler.  
</P>
<P>
 "He said, 'Hey Dude,' " Butler said, "then patted me on the back. I looked 
immediately at his hands, to see if he was carrying anything with him." 
</P>
<P>
 Ushers took him away, but with runners on first and second, the score tied at 
6-6 and none out, it wasn't exactly the time for a chat. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dodgers, who had earlier rallied from a 5-1 deficit, went to the bench, 
and Mitch Webster and Jeff Treadway reached base. After the encounter with the 
fan, Butler bunted hard toward third base, but Webster was forced at third. 
After DeShields walked, Mike Piazza struck out and Tim Wallach flied out to 
leave the bases loaded, sending the game into the 10th inning. 
</P>
<P>
 But the indication came early that this would be a long night. When Tom 
Candiotti doesn't have his knuckleball working, the early innings can be rough. 
By the time he departed in the third inning, the Padres led, 5-1. The Dodgers 
had used five pitchers, with the five relievers giving up only five hits and 
one run -- albeit the tying run -- over six innings. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't have any idea why (the knuckleball) wasn't moving, because I really 
don't know why it moves in the first place," Candiotti said.  
</P>
<P>
 Candiotti hasn't pitched less then six innings in each of his last 14 starts 
and has pitched seven or more innings in 11 of those starts. But he was also 
making his seventh appearance in a span of a month, during which he had pitched 
44 innings in his previous appearances. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the aggressive play of the Padres hasn't changed their position in 
the standings, but it has changed the perception other teams have of them. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our record is not good, but other clubs that play us know we will battle," 
Manager Jim Riggleman said. "We have had a run on some good pitching and our 
hitting has come up, it's ranked fifth in the league now. Other clubs have a 
renewed respect for us and we have been involved in a lot of close games." 
</P>
<P>
 Such was the case Tuesday, when the Dodgers, down, 5-4, in the fifth inning 
with one out, scored the tying run after Butler worked Padre starting pitcher 
Bill Krueger for a walk, then stole second and third base with DeShields at 
bat. 
</P>
<P>
 DeShields drove home Butler with a line-drive single, then scored on a stolen 
base, an error and a wild pitch by reliever Doug Brocail. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Padres tied the score against reliever Jim Gott, on a two singles, a 
wild pitch and a sacrifice fly.  
</P>
<P>
 The Dodgers had rallied in the bottom of the third inning, scoring three runs 
with two outs on a triple by DeShields, a single by Piazza and a two-run homer 
by Wallach. It was Wallach's 21st home run this season, equaling what the 
number he hit combined over the last two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Todd Worrell (6-4) pitched two hitless innings, striking out one and not 
giving up a walk.

PETCHEY SERVES UP AN UPSET OF CHANG; TENNIS: WITH STRONG SECOND SERVE, 
ENGLISHMAN OUSTS TOP-SEEDED PLAYER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Michael Chang, seeded No. 1 in the Los Angeles Open, was upset in the first 
round Tuesday by a tennis player from Great Britain who resembled a runaway 
trolley. 
</P>
<P>
 Chang, the sixth-ranked player in the world, relishes wearing opponents down 
during long matches, but he could do nothing to slow Mark Petchey, ranked 89th. 
</P>
<P>
 Petchey used a blistering second serve to oust Chang, 7-5, 6-2, punctuating 
his victory with an overhead slam, then held his arms above his head and yelled 
at the sky. 
</P>
<P>
 Chang left the court looking stunned. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was a little bit surprised that he was going for his second serve as much 
as he did," Chang said. "He was pretty successful using the corners and hitting 
the lines. I think it's easier to do that when you can go out and play in a 
match and not be under any pressure, not have anything to lose out there, just 
kind of go out and swing away." 
</P>
<P>
 Petchey hit seven aces, four of which came on second serves, and won 20 of 35 
second-serve points. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got my rhythm on my serve really easily in the last couple days and I knew 
against Michael I had to hit big second serves," Petchey said. "Anything short 
and he would just clock it for a winner. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was probably not that exciting because there were not too many rallies, 
but it was the only way I was going to beat him, me just kicking my serve and 
then coming in." 
</P>
<P>
 The turning point came when Petchey broke Chang, of Placentia, to take a 6-5 
lead in the first set. Petchey won the set on an ace and then gave up only two 
points in winning the first three games of the second set. 
</P>
<P>
 For Petchey, it was his biggest victory since defeating Michael Stich in the 
first round of the South African Indoor Championships in March. Chang has lost 
in first rounds five times in the 40 ATP tournaments he has played since 
turning professional in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 The last time Chang lost in the first round of the L.A. Open was in '88 to 
David Pate. 
</P>
<P>
 Chang said he was physically sound, but mentally frustrated. He lost in the 
round of 16 in the Players Limited International at Toronto last week to 
MaliVai Washington. It is the first time since April 1993 that Chang has lost 
consecutive matches. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think he played his best match, let's put it like that," Petchey 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Chang had two break-point opportunities and won one. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's tough to be a fighter when you're not able to do what you want to do," 
Chang said. "Some of the shots I was missing were just ridiculous." 
</P>
<P>
 The upset was particularly surprising because Chang, the 1989 French Open 
champion, has been a consistent presence in the late rounds of the L.A. Open. 
He was a finalist last year, losing to Richard Krajicek. He also lost in the 
1989 final, to Aaron Krickstein, and in the 1990 final, to Stefan Edberg. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would have liked to have had a really good week here in L.A., because for 
one thing, it's very close to home and another thing, it's a place that I enjoy 
playing," Chang said. 
</P>
<P>
 In other matches, Tuesday, second-seeded Boris Becker defeated Grant Stafford 
of South Africa, 7-5, 6-3, in a first-round match. 
</P>
<P>
 It is the first time Becker has played in the L.A. Open. Many wondered why 
Becker decided to play this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's kind of boring to play the same kind of tournament (every year). It's 
good to make a change in your scheduling, and that's why," Becker said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Becker, who said he hopes to get in a round of golf today, is not taking 
the tournament too seriously. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just not one of the biggest tournaments in the world," Becker said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the featured night match, third-seeded Andre Agassi defeated Nicklas Kulti 
of Sweden, 6-2, 6-1. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory appeared easy for 15th-ranked Agassi, although he said he did not 
take the match lightly. 
</P>
<P>
 "A guy like Nicklas Kulti, you know, if you're not playing your strengths 
well, he can look like an incredible tennis player," said Agassi, who lost to 
83rd-ranked Kulti in the first round of the Stockholm Open in 1990. "The fact 
that I was on my game so well, I really kind of made it look easy." 
</P>
<P>
 If Agassi, who won the Players' Limited International in Toronto last week, 
continues to play the way he played on Tuesday, he might just make the rest of 
his matches in this tournament look easy too. 
</P>
<P>
 Tennis Notes 
</P>
<P>
 It is surprising the L.A. Open does not have radar equipment to monitor the 
speed of serves considering that Richard Krajicek, the two-time defending 
champion, is playing. Pre-tournament news releases said Krajicek's serves have 
reached 132 m.p.h., the second-fastest ever recorded on the ATP tour. But 
without the equipment, L.A. Open crowds are left guessing. . . . Prize money in 
the tournament is $313,750 rather than the $325,000 previously reported. . . . 
Tuesday's crowd of 14,127 set a tournament record for single-day attendance.

 The NBA, in another signal of its intent to preserve the salary cap, Tuesday 
rejected the contracts signed by forwards Horace Grant and A.C. Green.

 Grant, a free agent from the Chicago Bulls, had signed with the Orlando Magic. 
Green had left the Phoenix Suns after exercising a clause that allowed him to 
become a free agent. 
</P>
<P>
 The contracts, seen by the league as well below market value, were similar to 
the one Chris Dudley signed with the Portland Trail Blazers last year. That 
deal was validated in federal court after the league contended it violated the 
salary cap.

 Johnny Bench, 46, wants to play pro golf on the seniors tour when he turns 50. 
Judging by the way he played at the Baseball Hall of Fame Golf Classic last 
Sunday, he might be ready for the regular PGA tour. 
</P>
<P>
 He shot a seven-under 65 with seven birdies and an eagle. It equaled the 
course tournament record at the 6,324-yard Leatherstocking Golf Course. The 
course record is 62. 
</P>
<P>
 Bench won the round by eight strokes, with Rollie Fingers trailing with a 73.  
</P>
<P>
 Said playing partner and 1970s Cincinnati Red teammate Joe Morgan:

 "I've played a lot of golf with Johnny, but I've never seen him put a round

 Trivia time: What was significant about the matchup of starting pitchers on 
Sept. 13, 1936, when Bob Feller of the Cleveland Indians met Randy Gumpert of 
the Philadelphia A's?

 Heisman flackery: Tim Tessalone, the USC sports information director who is 
pushing quarterback Rob Johnson for the Heisman Trophy this season, had 
Johnson's 1993 season run through the NFL quarterback ratings computer program. 
</P>
<P>
 Result: The Trojan quarterback's rating, 108.9, ties him for fourth with Dan 
Marino's 1984 season on the all-time top-five list, if his '93 season had been 
in the NFL.  
</P>
<P>
 The top rating goes to Joe Montana's 1989 season, 112.4; followed by Milt Plum 
in 1960, 110.4; Sammy Baugh in 1945, 109.9, then Marino. 
</P>
<P>
 The NFL's ratings system is a complicated formula factoring in completion 
percentages, interceptions, touchdown passes per attempts and average gain per 
completion.

</P>
<P>
 The whole story: The news service story from Sestriere, Italy, Sunday on 
Sergei Bubka's world-record pole vault was a little incomplete. 
</P>
<P>
 The story said Jackie Joyner-Kersee missed a long jump world record with a 
leap of 24 feet 7 inches. Maybe so, but she equaled her own American record. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Strike note: From Newsday's Marty Noble: "Please, no more of this: 'The 
players' salaries are pushing up ticket prices.' 
</P>
<P>
 "They have, of course. But if the players take 50% cuts, do you think the 
owners will roll back the costs of tickets?" 
</P>

<P>
 Milestone: Walter Johnson made his major league debut 87 years ago this week 
with the Washington Senators, losing, 3-2, to the Detroit Tigers.  
</P>
<P>
 He recovered. Johnson went on to win 416 games. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Milestone II: Michael Jordan had his greatest day in professional baseball 
Saturday in Birmingham, going two for four, including a home run and two runs 
batted in. It increased his average to .189. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Trivia answer: According to Feller, it's the youngest matchup of starting 
pitchers in history. Both were 18.

 Quotebook: Ken Griffey Jr., on his and Frank Thomas' seasons possibly being 
wiped out by a strike: "We're just in a situation where we picked a bad year to 
have a good year. We picked a bad time to go out and hit home runs and get on 
base and hit doubles." EARL GUSTKEY

COSTLY BULLFROG PENALTY PUTS VOODOO IN CONTROL; ROLLER HOCKEY: VANCOUVER SCORES 
FOUR GOALS ON POWER PLAY TO BEAT ANAHEIM, 10-8. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 There was one major penalty and two differing viewpoints, but it still added 
up to a 10-8 Bullfrog loss to the Vancouver VooDoo before 10,192 at The Pond of 
Anaheim on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Bullfrog defenseman Darren Perkins received a major penalty -- hitting from 
behind -- when he checked Vancouver's Todd Esselmont into the boards with 4.6 
seconds remaining in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Jason Jennings scored on the ensuing penalty shot to give Vancouver a 6-5 
lead, then the VooDoo scored three more unanswered goals on the five-minute 
power play to take control of the Roller Hockey International game. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't be running at a guy when he has no idea you're coming," Vancouver 
Coach Dave (Tiger) Williams said. "That's why they put that rule in: so no one 
gets killed. That penalty had to be called." 
</P>
<P>
 Bullfrog Coach Grant Sonier disagreed with the severity of the penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Esselmont) tried to avoid a check from Ken Murchison and turned into 
Perkins," Sonier said. "I saw the replay and I think the call was questionable. 
But there was no doubt, that five-minute major penalty was the difference in 
the game. Vancouver scored four goals off of it." 
</P>
<P>
 Williams agreed the penalty was crucial and his team cashed in the 
opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
 Jennings, Laurie Billeck and Kevin Hoffman each scored two goals, Rob Hyrtsak 
had a goal and four assists and Brent Bobyk had five assists for the VooDoo 
(12-6-1), who lead the Northwest Division. 
</P>
<P>
 For the Bullfrogs (12-5-1), it won't get any easier because they face the 
Pacific Division-leading Blades (14-4) tonight at the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
 "I give our team a lot of credit because we could have folded up our tent," 
Sonier said. "We kept coming back against a very good hockey club." 
</P>
<P>
 The Bullfrogs started quickly, scoring five goals in six minutes to take a 5-1 
lead with 3:51 remaining in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 But Vancouver would score eight consecutive goals over the next 19 minutes, 
capped by Esselmont's goal with 8:49 remaining in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Victor Gervais, who had three goals and an assist, tried to rally the 
Bullfrogs. Gervais and Rick Judson scored third-quarter power-play goals to cut 
the lead to 9-7.  
</P>
<P>
 After Billeck scored for Vancouver to push the lead to 10-7, Gervais scored on 
a slap shot with 1:58 remaining to make it 10-8. 
</P>
<P>
 With 3:30 remaining, the Bullfrogs pulled goalie Rob Laurie. But Anaheim only 
managed the one goal by Gervais.

 Top-ranked Steffi Graf used her overpowering game to dominate France's Alexia 
Dechaume-Balleret, 6-0, 6-1, Tuesday night in a second-round match in the 
$400,000 Toshiba Tennis Classic. 
</P>
<P>
 Graf, who had a first-round bye, needed just 47 minutes to move into today's 
third round against two-time NCAA champion Lisa Raymond. 
</P>
<P>
 "From anywhere, I felt like I could hit winners," Graf said. "It was just a 
really good feeling out there, especially with my forehand. It just went where 
I wanted it to." 
</P>
<P>
 Graf, who entered with a two-match losing streak, made quick work of 
Dechaume-Balleret as she won the first 11 games. 
</P>
<P>
 Lindsay Davenport, her serve humming on the hard courts, also enjoyed a quick 
afternoon of work, breezing past Stephanie Rottier, 6-2, 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
 Davenport, ranked sixth in the world and seeded fourth, surrendered only 12 
points on her serve.

ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Not too long ago in San Diego, TV cameras caught the Dodgers' Chris Gwynn 
covering his eyes in the dugout while the Padres' Tony Gwynn was batting. . . . 
 
</P>
<P>
 "That was a very important part of the game," Chris said. "I hated to see a 
guy like Tony at the plate against us with so much on the line. But I have the 
same kind of reaction when Barry Bonds or Matt Williams comes up and there's 
destruction to be done." . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The difference is that Chris Gwynn is unrelated to Bonds or Williams and is 
the younger brother of Tony Gwynn. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles-born, Long Beach-raised, San Diego State-educated Gwynns have 
the highest career batting average of any brother combination in major league 
history. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Before Tuesday night's game at Dodger Stadium, their average was .326 -- .333 
for Tony and .275 for Chris. Tony, 34, has had more than seven times as many 
at-bats as Chris, 29. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Tony was a third-round draft choice of the Padres in 1981. After Tony won the 
National League batting championship in 1984, the Dodgers selected Chris in the 
first round in 1985. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "Tony was born to hit," Chris said. "Combine that with his great work ethic 
and you've got a .333 career hitter." . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Chris hit .300 for the first time last year at Kansas City, but had only 287 
at-bats and was released before starting his second tour of duty as a Dodger 
reserve outfielder and pinch-hitter. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not disappointed about my career," Chris said. "I don't care who your 
brother is. It won't help you when you're in the batter's box." . . .  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Padres began the series with the worst record in the majors, but had a 
higher team batting average and a lower earned-run-average than the first-place 
Dodgers. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Tony Gwynn's 11-year-old son, Anthony II, has been serving as Padre batboy at 
Dodger Stadium. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 A prolonged strike might cost the Dodgers sellout crowds the last three dates 
of the regular season -- Sept. 30-Oct. 2 against Darryl Strawberry and the San 
Francisco Giants. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Home run hitter Matt Williams has only 13 doubles. Roger Maris had 16 in 1961, 
but Babe Ruth had 29 in 1927. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Cal Ripken has been hit by 42 pitches during his 2,001-game streak. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Former KMPC associates Steve Bailey, Bob Rowe and John Felz are preparing a 
90-minute radio special on the career of the late Jim Healy. The program will 
air on KMPC in Healy's old 5:30 p.m. time slot within the next two weeks. . . . 
 
</P>
<P>
 "Get Stoked on UCLA Football," is part of the advertising campaign for the 
Bruins and their star wide receiver, J.J. Stokes. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The PGA Championship at Riviera on Aug. 7-13, 1995, will be the fourth major 
played in Southern California. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Leo Diegel won the PGA at Hillcrest in 1929, Ben Hogan the U.S. Open at 
Riviera in 1947, and Hal Sutton the PGA at Riviera in 1983. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 There will be a new look to the turf club and box-seat area on Oct. 5 when the 
25th-anniversary Oak Tree meeting begins at Santa Anita. . . .

<P>
 "World Champion Bullfrogs," says the operator at the office of the Anaheim 
Bullfrogs, who won the inaugural Roller Hockey International title last year 
and play the L.A. Blades tonight at the Forum. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Boston Bruin wing Cam Neely portrays a truck driver in the movie, "Dumb and 
Dumber," starring Jim Carrey. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Wayne Gretzky and Rob Blake should be the only King untouchables in any 
further Brett Hull trade negotiations with the St. Louis Blues. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Regarding the Luc Robitaille trade, Gretzky makes suggestions, but doesn't 
close deals for the Kings. You might be surprised how many other stars do the 
same thing for their teams. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Pervis Ellison might turn out to be a steal for the Boston Celtics. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 M.L. Carr quickly has proven to be more than a towel-waver as Celtic general 
manager. . . . More than 14,000 tickets have been sold for the John R. Wooden 
Classic, matching UCLA-Kentucky and Kansas-Massachusetts on Dec. 3 at the 
18,200-seat Anaheim Arena. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 However, it is no shock that pro football ticket business is down in Anaheim. 
The Rams have sold only 24,300 season seats, about 11,000 fewer than last year 
at this time. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Nostalgia buffs ought to love the Classic Sports Network, a 24-hour-a-day 
cable channel scheduled to start operations this fall. . . .  
</P>

 Who is your sentimental favorite in the baseball labor dispute, the 
millionaire players or the billionaire owners?

AN AMATEUR HANGS WITH PROFESSIONALS; LONGBOARDS: LYNCH HAS GOOD FIRST DAY, 
ADVANCING THROUGH THREE HEATS AFTER STARTING AT 6 A.M. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Pat Lynch of Oceanside might have been the hardest working surfer on the first 
day of the U.S. Open of Surfing. 
</P>
<P>
 An amateur longboarder competing in his second professional contest, Lynch 
paddled out for the first time at 6 a.m. After handily defeating his three 
opponents, Lynch had an hour to kill before paddling out again. 
</P>
<P>
 Lynch won his next heat, although by a narrower margin. 
</P>
<P>
 Eight hours later, Lynch put the jersey back on and paddled out for another 
20-minute test. Facing professional longboarders Chris Schlickenmeyer and Terry 
Simms, Lynch caught eight waves and scored one seven-pointer on the way to a 
second-place 21.67 total. Schlickenmeyer of Torrance won the heat with 21.97 
points. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was my third heat," Lynch said. "They were fresh, and I had been sitting 
around all day." 
</P>
<P>
 The leader of the amateur division of the Professional Longboarding Assn. 
tour, Lynch, 21, struggles in an undefined space between professional and 
amateur. 
</P>
<P>
 His time in the water and weekday competitions, such as the Op Pro and the 
U.S. Open, prevent him from keeping a steady job. But as an amateur, he can 
only accept products from his sponsors and congratulations for any contest 
victories. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just have to get by on the bare essentials until I can turn pro," Lynch 
said. He added that he wants to have a consistent, winning record before he 
makes the move. 
</P>
<P>
 Lynch surfs next in Round 2 of the main event, today at 3:40 p.m. He'll face 
1992 world champion Joey Hawkins and Mark Cobb, 16th on the longboard tour. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tomorrow I'm surfing against guys I watch in videos," Lynch said. "It's great 
just to be here. There's world champions, future world champs and ex-world 
champs walking around." 
</P>
<P>
 In women's surfing, Megan Abubo continued to build on the momentum she created 
in the Op Pro, advancing into the second round of trials. Abubo, an amateur 
from Hawaii surfing in her first professional contest, narrowly missed the 
final round when she finished third to top professionals Lisa Andersen and 
Rochelle Ballard. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lisa's my idol," Abubo said. "I was just trying to surf without distraction 
but I couldn't catch any waves." 
</P>
<P>
 Friends had to persuade her to enter the Op Pro, but once she made the 
semifinal round, entering the U.S. Open was easy. 
</P>
<P>
 "The surfing gets harder but mentally it gets easier," as you advance through 
a contest, she said. "Now I'm going for anything." 
</P>
<P>
 Frieda Zamba of Flagler Beach, Fla., won her trial heat by 7.87 points, the 
largest margin of the day. 
</P>
<P>
 Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Today's schedule: 6-7:20 a.m. -- Women's trials, Round 2; 7:20 a.m.-2 p.m. -- 
Men's main event, Round 1; 2-3:40 p.m. -- Women's main event, Round 1;

FISHING REPORT: CONVICT LAKE CAN'T HOLD TROPHY TROUT BREAKOUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The hanging of big fish is becoming a popular pastime at Convict Lake. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every day they're bringing in no less than four and as many as six fish in 
the three-, four- and five-pound range," said David DeSurra, owner of the 
concession at the picturesque Eastern Sierra reservoir. 
</P>
<P>
 And then there was the 6-pound 8-ounce rainbow -- the biggest catch in the 
region to date -- pulled from the inlet by Bill Evans of Upland.  
</P>
<P>
 "I have 32 pictures of big fish taken in the last week," DeSurra said, adding 
that there have also been plenty of limits of pan-size fish coming in.

OUTDOOR NOTES / PETE THOMAS: FIRST MARLIN OF YEAR CAUGHT OFF CATALINA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETE THOMAS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rick Macklin knew he had hooked into something special the minute his line 
started screaming from his reel. 
</P>
<P>
 Macklin was fishing last Saturday with two brother-in-laws aboard his boat 
Popeye off the east end of Santa Catalina Island when the fish struck his lure 
and high-tailed it to the high seas. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a large striped marlin that, if successfully landed, would be the first 
marlin caught in California this year. It's a distinction local marlin 
fishermen strive for. 
</P>
<P>
 The only problem was, neither of Macklin's companions had fished for marlin or 
driven a boat with state-of-the-art electronics. When Macklin grabbed the rod, 
Kevin Klatt took the helm. But the boat was on auto-pilot, and Klatt had no 
idea how to turn it off. 
</P>
<P>
 When he finally found the switch and turned the boat toward the fleeing fish, 
the marlin had taken almost all the 30-pound-test dacron line from Macklin's 
spool.  
</P>
<P>
 "He was on top of the water," Macklin said of the jumping billfish, "and he 
was not happy." 
</P>
<P>
 Klatt managed to turn the boat and give chase, Macklin gaining line along the 
way. 
</P>
<P>
 A little more than an hour after the hookup, Macklin had the fish alongside 
the boat. Kim Klatt grabbed the leader, and Macklin stuck the striper with a 
gaff. 
</P>
<P>
 Macklin, 47, of Huntington Harbour, secured the fish on the swimstep and set a 
course for the pier in Avalon. After a victory lap inside the harbor, he 
registered his fish at Avalon Seafood. It weighed in at 189 1/2 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a member of Avalon Tuna Club, the Southern California Tuna Club and 
Huntington Harbour Anglers, so I've got a lot of hardware coming to me," 
Macklin said of the trophies he will receive for his achievement. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Macklin might have landed the first marlin of the year, but on the same day he 
was struggling with his, another Orange County angler was involved in a 
deep-sea battle with a slightly larger but much stronger foe. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Von Henkle, 57, of Newport Beach, hooked into a 204-pound broadbill 
swordfish while en route home from San Clemente Island. 
</P>
<P>
 Von Henkle battled the fish for more than two hours before bringing it 
alongside the boat. The crew managed to subdue the powerful fish, but not 
before it smashed some of the glass on the boat with a whack of its sturdy 
bill. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was like arm wrestling for two hours," Von Henkle said of the fight. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Macklin, Von Henkle is an experienced angler. But often, experience is no 
match for a swordfish, considered by many the most powerful fish in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've hooked 44 and caught eight," Von Henkle said. "One of them I fought for 
22 hours and another I fought for 16 hours."  
</P>
<P>
 He didn't win either fight.

 Closing item in Monday's Wavefax, a Surfline/Wavetrak newsletter: "A small 
white shark was captured just off La Jolla last week and is now being watched 
over at Sea World. It makes you wonder if Mama is nearby . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 Mama may not be, but one of Surfline's reporters was chased out of the water 
Monday morning while surfing off the Del Mar River mouth by a shark estimated 
at 6 feet-plus.  
</P>
<P>
 "He was still looking very pale this afternoon," Sean Collins at Surfline said 
in the fax. "See ya out there."

 Albert C. Taucher, a longtime member and three-time president of the 
California Fish and Game Commission, died last week after a lengthy illness. 
</P>
<P>
 Taucher, appointed to the commission in 1983 by then-Gov. George Deukmejian, 
was an avid outdoorsman and very popular among his co-commissioners. "His 
insight, concern for the rights of anglers and hunters, and good humor were 
noteworthy at commission meetings for more than a decade," said Robert Treanor, 
executive director of the commission. "He will be missed by commission members 
and staff." 
</P>
<P>
 Private services for Taucher were held this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Briefly 
</P>
<P>
 SAN DIEGO LONG-RANGE -- The overnight fleet is still hurting for fish, while 
those aboard the three- and four-day boats are finding all they can handle. 
Small yellowfin tuna are making up most of the catches, but big bluefin are 
providing most of the bulk. An angler aboard the Spirit of Adventure landed a 
bluefin weighing 174.3 pounds. Brett Rubin of Malibu, fishing aboard the 
Vagabond, caught five bluefin weighing 100 pounds or more, the largest a 
131-pounder. Most of the fish are still at least 200 miles southwest of the 
landings, well out of range of the overnight fleet. 
</P>
<P>
 CABO SAN LUCAS -- Blue marlin are increasingly active, though few are of 
noteworthy size. Dockmaster Mario Bonaga spent a day on the Tracy Ann with 
relatives from Tijuana and they experienced a triple hookup with a blue marlin, 
striped marlin and sailfish, all of which were released. After that, they 
boated a 176-pound yellowfin tuna. Yellowfin and dorado are extremely abundant, 
keeping action off Land's End at a maximum.  
</P>
<P>
 FLY FISHING -- Author Dick Talleur is making the circuit next week, giving 
presentations for the Downey Fly Fishers Tuesday, details: (714) 952-3552; the 
Pasadena Casting Club Aug. 10, details: (818) 449-1152, and the Conejo Valley 
Fly Fishers Aug. 11, details: (805) 496-7332. 
</P>
<P>
 MISCELLANY -- Hubbs-Sea World Research Institute will break ground Thursday in 
Carlsbad for an experimental fish hatchery that will be capable of producing 
400,000 juvenile fish annually. The new hatchery is expected to be operational 
by the spring of 1995. The facility will be the first marine hatchery dedicated 
to the enhancement of depleted species. White sea bass, giant sea bass and 
halibut are among such species. . . . Quail Unlimited's Snake Break '94, a 
clinic designed to "snake-proof" hunting dogs, will be held Saturday and Sunday 
in Norco. Details: (909) 735-0136.

GOLF NOTEBOOK / MARTIN BECK; MANOS MAKES GOOD ON SECOND CAREER SHOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN BECK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Kelly Manos gave professional golf his best shot after graduating from USC in 
1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Manos joined the professional Golden State Tour, golf's equivalent to a Class 
A baseball team. 
</P>
<P>
 As a touring professional -- if you call driving around California in a truck 
touring -- Manos didn't win a tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 "I gave it a year's try and didn't do it after that," said Manos, who in 1983 
won the Empire League individual championship and helped Los Alamitos to the 
league title. "It's pretty tough, you're either making it or missing it by a 
couple shots. It's not a very stable life." 
</P>
<P>
 Then Manos found another way to making a living from golf: he got a job as an 
assistant pro at Yorba Linda Country Club. And now a few years later, his 
competitive playing career is taking off. 
</P>
<P>
 He qualified for the Los Angeles Open and missed the cut by three strokes and 
qualified for Nike Tour events in Southern California the last two years. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday, he won the Southern California PGA's apprentice championship on the 
fourth hole of a playoff. Manos and Jim LeTourneau of Shadowridge Country Club 
in Vista tied at six-under-par 136 after two rounds at Singing Hills Country 
Club in El Cajon. 
</P>
<P>
 Manos made par on the fourth hole of the playoff to qualify for the national 
PGA assistants championship at PGA West in La Quinta in November. 
</P>
<P>
 Manos, who shot 69-67, said his iron play was outstanding. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was knocking my irons one foot from the hole," Manos said. "I hit my wedge 
about a foot from the hole about three times. I've never experienced anything 
like that. It was awesome." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Tiger Woods, who won the Southern California Amateur last month, finished in a 
tie for eighth at the Porter Cup, a major tournament on the amateur circuit, 
Saturday at Niagara Falls Country Club in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Woods, an 18-year-old from Cypress, shot six-under 204 for the tournament, 
which was shortened to three rounds because rain, and finished three shots 
behind the winner, Allen Doyle of LaGrange, Ga. 
</P>
<P>
 Next stop for Woods is the Western Amateur, which starts today at Point O 
Woods Golf and Country Club in Benton Harbor, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton's Terry Noe, who won the U.S. Junior Amateur title last week, hardly 
had to time celebrate before he was off to another tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Noe is in Mexico City playing with the Southern California team in the boys' 
Junior Americas Cup. Jin Park, also of Fullerton, Jimmy Lee of Irvine and 
Michael Chavez of San Diego are Noe's teammates. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton's Jenny Lee, who plays with Noe and Park on the Sunny Hills High 
golf team, is playing in the girls' Junior Americas Cup this week in Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff McGraw of Fullerton and Steve Wagner of Mission Viejo qualified for the 
California Junior Amateur tournament, which starts Monday at Sunnyside Country 
Club in Fresno. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Golf tip of the week: Dave Duran, an assistant professional at El Niguel 
Country Club, says putting is one of the most misunderstood parts of the game. 
"It is in fact simple; people make it difficult," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 It doesn't matter what the stance, grip or stroke you use as long as you have 
chosen the exact line the ball must travel and have a feeling for how hard to 
strike the putt. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lastly, the player must have a stroke which is comfortable, repeatable and 
consistent with his intended line," he said.

AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP; CONE HELPS ROYALS RUN WINNING STREAK TO 11 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 David Cone had poor control and average velocity and gave up two runs in the 
first inning. 
</P>
<P>
 But it didn't matter as baseball's hottest team, the Kansas City Royals, still 
defeated the Oakland A's, 6-4, on Tuesday night at Kansas City, extending the 
major leagues' longest winning streak of the season to 11 games. 
</P>
<P>
 "The guys could tell I didn't have my best stuff tonight," said Cone (16-4), 
who walked one and struck out five through eight innings and tied Jimmy Key for 
the league victory lead. "They knew they had to pick me up, and they did. 
That's what happens when a team's on a streak." 
</P>
<P>
 The only longer streak in Royal history was a 16-game run in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago 6, Texas 2 -- Ranger pitcher Kenny Rogers lasted only 5 1/3 innings at 
Arlington, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
 Rogers, who last Thursday threw the 12th perfect game in modern major league 
history and the first by an American League left-hander, kept up a tradition of 
struggling in the next outing. Only three of the group -- Cy Young in 1904, 
Catfish Hunter in 1968 and Tom Browning in 1988 -- won their next appearance. 
</P>
<P>
 Rogers left with one out in the sixth after Lance Johnson's line driveup the 
middle grazed off the index finger of his throwing hand. Trainers said he was 
unhurt. 
</P>
<P>
 Rogers retired nine in a row before walking Julio Franco with one out in the 
fourth. Robin Ventura then hit a 2-and-2 fastball for his 17th homer, putting 
the White Sox ahead, 3-1. 
</P>
<P>
 Toronto 8, Boston 7 -- Ed Sprague had three hits and drove in three runs, and 
John Olerud hit a tie-breaking homer in the seventh inning at Boston. 
</P>
<P>
 Wes Chamberlain's grand slam highlighted a six-run Red Sox fourth that also 
included a two-run double by Scott Cooper. 
</P>
<P>
 Detroit 12, Cleveland 9 -- Mickey Tettleton's two-run home run capped a 
five-run ninth inning for the Tigers at Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
 The Indians' sloppy defense and poor pitching gave away a 9-7 lead in the 
ninth. Tony Phillips led off with a single against Jeff Russell (0-6), and Lou 
Whitaker then hit a potential double-play grounder that second baseman Carlos 
Baerga threw into left field, letting one run score. 
</P>
<P>
 A single by Travis Fryman put runners at first and third before Cecil 
Fielder's RBI single tied the score. Kirk Gibson's sacrifice fly against Derek 
Lilliquist put Detroit ahead, 10-9, and Tettleton followed with his 16th home 
run. 
</P>
<P>
 New York 7, Milwaukee 1 -- Don Mattingly singled to start a six-run 
ninth-inning outburst at Milwaukee, and capped it with a two-run double. 
</P>
<P>
 Jamie Navarro (4-8) surrendered three consecutive singles to open the ninth, 
including Matt Nokes' run-scoring hit to right that scored Mattingly from 
second. 
</P>
<P>
 Graeme Lloyd relieved Navarro with one out and intentionally walked Pat Kelly 
to load the bases. He then walked Luis Polonia and Wade Boggs, forcing home two 
more runs for a 4-1 lead. Kelly scored on Paul O'Neill's groundout and Lloyd 
walked Danny Tartabull to load the bases again. Mattingly followed with a 
two-run double. 
</P>
<P>
 Baltimore 10, Minnesota 0 -- The Orioles shut out the Twins for the second 
consecutive game at Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Mussina (15-5) retired the first 12 before Kent Hrbek opened the fifth 
with a clean single to center. Mussina then gave up an infield single to Shane 
Mack, but got out of the inning and finished with a four-hitter over seven 
innings.

 During the spring of 1993, Rudy Seanez thought his career might be over, and 
that was after he had recovered from back and shoulder problems.  
</P>
<P>
 "There was one time last spring when I couldn't even throw," said Seanez, who 
was with the Colorado Rockies at the time."I tried a couple of doctors and then 
went to a kinesiologist in Denver and he found that some muscles in my back had 
atrophied." 
</P>
<P>
 The pain, though, had circuited to Seanez' right shoulder, and he had surgery 
in the winter of 1992. "I thought, 'They've already fixed my shoulder, I know 
that,' " Seanez said. "That's when I thought I might be finished." 
</P>
<P>
 After treatments by the kinesiologist, Seanez was back throwing in two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Before Tuesday's game, Seanez had not allowed a run in his last six 
appearances and had stranded four of the last five runners he had inherited.

WEARY MARINERS TAKE IT ALL OUT ON ANGELS; ANGELS: GRIFFEY HITS 37TH HOME RUN AS 
SEATTLE ROMPS TO A 10-2 VICTORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Seattle Mariners arrived Tuesday afternoon at Anaheim Stadium in a rotten 
mood. They weren't supposed to be here in the first place until their roof 
started falling in at the Kingdome. Plans of playing in Tacoma were abandoned 
when the Angels protested. And if that weren't cruel enough, their off-day was 
spent traveling and playing in an exhibition game in Cooperstown, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
 They slowly walked into the visiting clubhouse at Anaheim Stadium, wondering 
how life can possibly get worse, and immediately were taken aback by a foul 
odor. The sewer had backed up and was seeping on the clubhouse floor. 
</P>
<P>
 "Beautiful," Mariner right fielder Jay Buhner said, "simply bleeping 
beautiful." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Ken Griffey Jr.: "I think we should bag this and go for a neutral site. 
Let's go to Peoria (Ariz.). They banged us. Let's bang them." 
</P>
<P>
 The Mariners cursed, angrily dressed, stepped onto the field, and unleashed 
their vented frustration upon the Angels, winning, 10-2, in front of 11,478 
fans -- the smallest Anaheim Stadium crowd since 1978. 
</P>
<P>
 "We stunk, we played like a bunch of triple-A players," Angel Manager Marcel 
Lachemann angrily said. "It was the worst exhibition of baseball we have put on 
all year, and it will not happen again. 
</P>
<P>
 "I take full responsibility. If I can't get them to play any better than that 
. . . I'm embarrassed, and if they're not embarrassed, it's a sad state of 
affairs." 
</P>
<P>
 Lachemann was particularly upset with starter Phil Leftwich, who was slow 
picking up a Felix Fermin grounder in the fifth inning, and threw the ball 
away. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was not acceptable," Lachemann said. "The only way he should throw the 
ball away is if he has a broken leg." 
</P>
<P>
 The game was played amid the sounds of heavy construction as the new 
scoreboard was being erected in the upper deck. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've seen just about everything this year," Buhner said. "You ever hear that 
expression, 'You learn something new every day.' Well, every day we see 
something new." 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels' biggest concern about this series is that their fans might be a 
bit rambunctious. Most never have had the opportunity to have such close seats 
for a major league game. 
</P>
<P>
 Who would have imagined the most unruly folks in the place would be the Angels 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 There was Bo Jackson getting called out on a third strike in the fourth inning 
and ejected by plate umpire Al Clark. Jackson became livid. He screamed at 
Clark, and retreated to the bench. 
</P>
<P>
 Uh-oh, out came a bag full of balls, 17 of which rolled onto the field. Out 
came a box full of sunflower seeds, with perhaps 40 being strewn. Out went 
Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
 In the sixth inning, there was Chili Davis striking out, and shattering the 
bat over his right knee, stalking to the bench. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a hell of a night," Mariner Manager Lou Piniella said, "I've never 
seen Bo Jackson get that mad. And Chili Davis. . . . you got to be strong to do 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 The game included Ken Griffey Jr.'s 37th home run, helping to end the 
Mariners' seven-game losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mariners' fourth and fifth hitters in the order combined for two homers 
and five runs batted in, the Angels' duo combined for six strikeouts. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, we'd like to play in a different place, but I can't blame the 
Angels for not wanting to play in Tacoma," Buhner said. "I feel the same way. I 
don't want to play in no triple-A ballpark either.

 Angel shortstop Gary DiSarcina's alert play Sunday against the Texas Rangers, 
when he noticed that Will Clark missed second base on his way to third, caused 
quite a disturbance. 
</P>
<P>
 Juan Gonzalez apparently became irate when he realized that Clark's mistake 
cost him a hit and began throwing a tantrum in the dugout. Before anyone knew 
it, Gonzalez and pitcher Kevin Brown began shoving, which was witnessed by 
several Angels. 
</P>
<P>
 "I kept looking over," DiSarcina said, "it got pretty interesting in there. 
Jose (Canseco) kind of broke things up."

 Torey Lovullo, the Angel infielder who was released this spring, was recalled 
from triple-A Calgary and joined the Mariners for the game. He replaced 
19-year-old shortstop Alex Rodriguez, who was batting .204 with six errors in 
only 17 games. Rodriguez, 19, was the youngest player in the majors. . . . 
Angel right fielder Tim Salmon is expected to be activated from the 15-day 
disabled list today. Rookie outfielder Garret Anderson is expected to be sent 
back to triple-A Vancouver. BOB NIGHTENGALE

 Former Dodger catcher Mike Scioscia, 35, who has spent the last 15 months 
attempting a comeback from major shoulder surgery, has called it quits. He had 
a .259 average, 68 homers and 446 RBIs in 1,441 games with the Dodgers from 
1980 to 1992. He signed as a free agent with San Diego after the 1992 season, 
but didn't play in a game. 
</P>
<P>
 Red owner Marge Schott stalked out of a Cincinnati City Council meeting set up 
expressly to get her views on a smoking ordinance when one speaker suggested 
attendance at Reds games is down because she has offended fans with her racial 
ad ethnic slurs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to be in the same room with the man," Schott said as she left 
the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 A council member raced to stop her on the front steps of City Hall and begged 
her to return. After deliberation with team officials, she went back inside and 
blamed the city's restrictions on smoking at Riverfront Stadium for lagging 
attendance. 
</P>
<P>
 Schott, a smoker, told council members they should worry more about crime, 
drugs and children born to mothers with drug addictions. "That's where we 
should be concentrating instead of (on) smoking in an open-air stadium," Schott 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Red pitcher Erik Hanson suffered a torn anterior cruciate ligament in his left 
knee fielding a bunt against the San Francisco Giants on Monday and will sit 
out the rest of the season. . . . Pittsburgh Pirate outfielder Al Martin, tied 
for the team lead in both home runs and stolen bases, might sit out the rest of 
the season after undergoing surgery on his left wrist. . . . The St. Louis 
Cardinals activated pitcher Rheal Cormier from the 15-day disabled list and 
sent pitcher Gary Buckles to triple-A Louisville. . . .. Baltimore Oriole 
left-hander Sid Fernandez, scratched from his scheduled start today, received a 
cortisone injection in his aching left knee, which might push his next start as 
far back as next Monday in New York. Left-hander Jamie Moyer will replace 
Fernandez.

</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nineteen players from area high schools have been selected to play in the 
annual Area Code Games, the West's premier showcase for high school baseball 
talent. The Games will take place at Blair Field in Long Beach Aug. 17-20. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the top prospects is Montclair Prep outfielder Darrell Dent, the only 
local player selected to the Games as a junior last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Others selected to the team representing the 818 and 805 area codes are 
Crespi's Brad Farlow, Rio Mesa's Eric Flores and Chad Snyder, Agoura's Matt 
Gershon, Granada Hills' Josh Goldberg and Jim Landress, Faith Baptist's Judd 
Granzow, Saugus' Brandon Hernandez, Crespi's Ron Jones, Crescenta Valley's

Nieto, Palmdale's Chris Paxton, Hart's Luis Sanchez, Montclair Prep's Jared 
Sandler, Westlake's Todd Singleton, and Alemany's Jon Tucker. Baseball 
</P>
<P>
 A three-run second inning and Jon Tucker's two-run single in the seventh 
lifted the North to a 5-3 victory over the South in the Southern California 
American Legion All-Star game Tuesday at Jackie Robinson Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 The Northridge Little League 12-year-old all-stars defeated Chino, 11-2, in 
the first round of Division II play in Rialto. 
</P>
<P>
 Nathaniel Dunlap pitched all six innings for Northridge, striking out 13. 
Peter Tuber slugged a two-run home run and Matt Cunningham was three for four. 
</P>
<P>
 The Thousand Oaks Little League 13-year-old all-stars defeated Santana 
National, 1-0, behind the three-hit pitching of Chris Strausser to advance to 
the third round of Division II play. 
</P>
<P>
 A bases-loaded single by Brad Farlow with two out in the bottom of the 10th 
inning lifted the Valley Rangers to a 9-8 victory over Oceanview and the Connie 
Mack Baseball state championship Saturday at Blair Field in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Rangers (30-4) were eliminated from the Western Regional Tournament in 
Long Beach Sunday when they lost to Tucson, 2-1, and Orange County, 6-4. Golf 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Turner of Sherman Oaks shot a three-under-par 69 Tuesday to grab a share 
of the first-round lead at the 28th Pacific Coast Amateur championship at Bear 
Creek Golf Club in Murrieta, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
 Turner, a 37-year-old left-hander and a former L.A. City Men's champion, was 
one of 20 players in the 81-man invitational to shoot par or better in the 
72-hole, stroke-play event. 
</P>
<P>
 Turner, 37, is tied for first with Roger Tambellini of Templeton, Calif., and 
Scott Fairbanks of Orem, Utah. Craig Steinberg of Van Nuys shot 79 and is not 
likely to make the 36-hole cut. The field will be trimmed to the low 42 plus 
ties after today's round. 
</P>
<P>
 Darren Angel of Northridge continued his summer of torrid golf by firing a 
two-under-par 68 in the first round of the American Junior Golf Assn. Boys' 
Junior Championship at the Four Seasons Resort in Irving, Tex. Angel, a senior 
at Granada Hills High, is in a three-way tie for third place. 
</P>
<P>
 Angel, 17, trails leader Michael Henderson of Raleigh, N.C., by four shots. 
Ben Cherney of Encino shot 74 and is locked in a five-way tie for 44th place. 
</P>
<P>
 Chad Wright of Ventura shot an even-par 142 over 36 holes to win the overall 
title in the Sunset Hills Country Club junior championship in Thousand Oaks. 
Jake Breeze of Simi Valley shot 164 to win the boys' 16-18 title.

 Westlake High senior Brandon DiTullio birdied the first playoff hole to win 
the Lee Hammil Memorial Jr. tournament at Los Coyotes Country Club in Buena 
Park. Cycling

AMERICAN LEGION BASEBALL / JEFF FLETCHER; QUESTION OF ALLEGIANCE CAUSES 
CONTROVERSY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF FLETCHER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Don't frown on Dan Martinez and Richard Soliz, the Camarillo pitchers who 
originally told their coach they didn't want to pitch in the Area 6 playoffs 
last week. They wanted to save their arms for last Sunday's tryout for the Area 
Code Games, the premier showcase for high school players in the West. 
</P>
<P>
 One Legion official said he would have kicked the players off his team if he 
were the coach. 
</P>
<P>
 Camarillo Coach Ron Regalado stuck by the players, he said, because he agreed 
to the arrangement before the playoffs began. 
</P>
<P>
 The controversy proved moot, however. Jody Breeden, one of the coaches who 
selects players for the Area Code Games, told the players he would watch them 
pitch in the playoffs Saturday, and that would serve as their tryout. 
</P>
<P>
 The pitchers both lost and neither made the team, but their original decision 
is still understandable. Martinez and Soliz believed that their performances in 
Sunday's tryout would be the sole factor determining selection to the Area Code 
team. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider what the Area Code Games mean to a player: About 200 scouts and 60 
college coaches showed up to last year's Games in San Diego. This year's event 
will be in Long Beach August 17-20. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 35 players from area high schools who played in the Games in 1992 and 
1993, 32 have signed to play Division I college baseball or were drafted. 
</P>
<P>
 Justin Siegel, from Taft, earned a scholarship to North Carolina State 
primarily because of three impressive innings he pitched at the 1992 Games. 
</P>
<P>
 The benefit of pitching in the Legion playoffs? 
</P>
<P>
 Say what you like about the wonderful memories of an Area 6 championship, but 
they won't help pay any bills in 10 years, the way a college degree or pro 
baseball career can. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Catch this: Westlake-Royal's defense was probably the aspect most responsible 
for the team not winning the Area 6 championship. Defense had been a strength 
all season, but in the playoffs, Westlake-Royal made 23 errors in six games. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had lapses and the lapses came at bad times," Coach Mike McClure said. "I 
don't know why. If we had answers to that, we probably wouldn't be coaching at 
this level." 
</P>
<P>
 The costliest was a four-error ninth inning Friday night against eventual 
champion Arcadia. Two of the errors came on bunts. 
</P>
<P>
 Westlake-Royal had additional trouble fielding bunts in the championship game 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 In two games against Arcadia, Westlake-Royal failed to record an out on any of 
four sacrifice attempts, either because of errors or players not covering the 
proper bases. 
</P>
<P>
 "We instituted a few new bunt defenses late in the year, and when you do that 
you are likely to have some breakdowns," McClure said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 To the rescue: In a six-team, double-elimination tournament crammed into four 
days, the key is to have pitchers with endurance. Four pitchers from local 
teams had staff-saving performances at the Area 6 playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 * Westlake-Royal pitcher Maki Kramer pitched 12 innings Sunday, the maximum 
allowed by Legion rules. Kramer hadn't pitched in two weeks because of a minor 
knife wound he suffered apprehending a shoplifter at a Simi Valley store. But 
he beat Arcadia on Sunday and started the second game, pitching three scoreless 
innings before he reached the inning limit. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was unbelievable," Westlake-Royal pitcher Todd Singleton said. "I didn't 
think he could do it, but that just shows what kind of pitcher he is." 
</P>
<P>
 * Valley North's Jim DeBiase pitched a complete game Friday, beating St. 
Bernard in an elimination game with a six-hit, one-run, 10-strikeout 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
 * Camarillo's Brian Garrettson opened the tournament Thursday with a five-hit, 
13-strikeout game against St. Bernard. 
</P>
<P>
 * Camarillo's Soliz pitched a complete game in an 11-10 loss to Westlake-Royal 
on Saturday night. It wasn't an artistic performance, but it was gutty, which 
is another way of saying he scattered 17 hits over nine innings and threw 160 
pitches. He was the only pitcher Camarillo had left. 
</P>
<P>
 * Camarillo's Manuel Chavira pitched eight innings against Westchester on 
Friday, allowing no earned runs on five hits with no walks in a 4-1 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Hot hitters: Some of the top offensive performances of the tournament: 
</P>
<P>
 * Westlake-Royal catcher Ben Lemos hit two home runs in the tournament, 
equaling his team's total from the regular season. In the two games against 
Arcadia on Sunday, Lemos was six for nine with five runs batted in. 
</P>
<P>
 * Valley North's Tony Montiel had hits in his final nine at-bats, including a 
two-out single in the ninth inning Saturday that pulled Valley North even with 
Westlake-Royal, which won in 10 innings, 9-8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Westlake-Royal's Joel Mellinger was 11 for 22 with 11 runs and seven RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
 * Camarillo's Rodell Desamparo was seven for 12. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Golden gloves: Some of the standout defensive plays of the tournament: 
</P>
<P>
 * Westlake-Royal first baseman Matt Pitstick made a leaping catch of a line 
drive and then turned an unassisted double play with the bases loaded in the 
seventh inning of the team's first game against Arcadia. 
</P>
<P>
 * Westlake-Royal left fielder Bryan Fernandez threw out an Arcadia runner at 
the plate in the seventh inning of the championship game, preserving a tie 
score. 
</P>
<P>
 * Valley North center fielder Brian Wittman made a diving catch against St. 
Bernard. 
</P>
<P>
 * Camarillo catcher Desamparo caught a foul pop while sliding into the 
backstop. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Add defense: The best play of the tournament, however, wasn't made by an area 
player. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first inning of Friday's meeting between Westlake-Royal and Arcadia, 
Kevin Mellinger drilled a ball to deep center field. Arcadia center fielder 
Josh Oder raced back and made an over-the-shoulder catch that brought gasps 
from the crowd at Jackie Robinson Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Oder spun and fired the ball back into the infield, and shortstop Justin 
Stewart made a strong throw to double Brent Egan off first base.

STONES REFUSE TO FADE AWAY; POP MUSIC: WITH A NEW BASSIST, MICK JAGGER AND 
COMPANY KICK OFF THE 'VOODOO LOUNGE' TOUR PLAYING HARDER, FASTER AND WITH A 
BETTER FOUNDATION THAN THEY'VE HAD IN YEARS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Rolling Stones had to wait 30 years for bassist Bill Wyman to finally 
retire, but his replacement didn't happen a tour too soon. At RFK Stadium on 
Monday night, with new bassist Darryl Jones, Mick Jagger and company kicked off 
the "Voodoo Lounge" world expedition playing harder, faster and with a better 
bottom than they've had in years. How many other grandfathers can say the same? 
</P>
<P>
 Where Charlie Watts' economical drumming is the understated key to the Stones' 
mature rock energy, Wyman was a plodding plunker. Jones, who is a more 
aggressive, inventive bassist than Wyman, adds meat and muscle to the artful 
snap of Watts' timekeeping. 
</P>
<P>
 With this sloppy but grand return, the Stones have managed an impressive sonic 
overhaul. Compared to the brake-riding torpor of 1989's "Steel Wheels" tour, 
the lamest crawl in a career of unhurried concerts, these were speed trials. 
</P>
<P>
 In an uninterrupted two hours and 20 minutes, Jagger, Watts, guitar twins 
Keith Richards and Ron Wood -- aided by Jones, keyboardist Chuck Leavell, 
saxophonist Bobby Keys, three other horn players and two backup singers -- blew 
through more than two dozen songs with the terse, jacked-up energy of concise 
singles. 
</P>
<P>
 Arriving to a thunderous drumbeat and a steady barrage of smoking red flares, 
the Stones launched into a pumped-up version of "Not Fade Away," the Buddy 
Holly song that became their first American Top 100 single in 1964. "Undercover 
of the Night" and "Tumbling Dice" followed, then "Live With Me," in which the 
murky depth of Jones' bass failed the song's febrile riff and melted it into a 
dull blur. 
</P>
<P>
 The rusty beginning to this not-quite-perfect show didn't matter. Neither did 
the special effects: a cast of ludicrous, ineffectual inflatables during "Love 
Is Strong," a pair of costumed stilt-walkers during "Monkey Man" and enough 
opening and closing fireworks to incinerate a small town.  
</P>
<P>
 If Jagger's athletic displays were a notch less athletic than five years ago, 
the 51-year-old is by no means ready for a wheelchair. More unsettling was the 
degree to which prominent-in-the-mix backup singers Bernard Fowler and Lisa 
Fischer filled out his singing. 
</P>
<P>
 "You Got Me Rocking" was the same nothing it is on "Voodoo Lounge," and "Rocks 
Off" had rough patches in which the beat collapsed, but the new "Sparks Will 
Fly" was sharp and tight. "(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction" was a revelation, a 
fierce, angry rip through the most familiar song in the band's vast repertoire. 
</P>
<P>
 "Beast of Burden" slowed the show down enough to let Jagger (playing piano) 
slide into a pretty "Memory Motel" and the new album's haunting "Out of Tears," 
on which he played guitar. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hot Stuff" and "Brand New Car" were torpid drones, and a version of the 
Temptations' (by way of Al Green) "I Can't Get Next to You" was a better idea 
than reality, but "Honky Tonk Women," "Before They Make Me Run" (sung with 
typical croaky aplomb by Keith Richards) and "Start Me Up" were impressively 
propelled by the band's newfound vigor. 
</P>
<P>
 Ending with a gratuitous pyrotechnic coda instead of a climactic musical 
moment, the show's final section (a demobilized "Street Fighting Man," "Brown 
Sugar" and "Jumpin' Jack Flash") didn't lead anywhere but to the exits. But 
between the heat, the humidity and the exhaustion, it was definitely time to 
go.

WHAT BECOMES A LEGEND MOST: NOTORIETY, MUSIC?; COMMENTARY: THE HOOPLA OVER THE 
JACKSON-PRESLEY MARRIAGE COULD FURTHER OBSCURE HIS CREATIVE FOCUS. ONLY QUALITY 
MUSIC-MAKING CAN LEGITIMIZE HIS KING OF POP CLAIM.

<P>
 And we thought Julia and Lyle were the ultimate odd couple of the '90s. 
</P>
<P>
 This week's confirmation of Michael Jackson and Lisa Marie Presley's May 
wedding takes us beyond the realm of the merely quirky and into the world of 
the genuinely bizarre. 
</P>
<P>
 Here you have Jackson, currently the most famous pop star in the world -- 
fresh from the humiliation of child molestation charges -- in desperate need of 
re-establishing his credibility and image. 
</P>
<P>
 He marries the daughter of the most famous pop star of all time -- straight 
from her own heartbreaking divorce -- wondering perhaps if she can ever find 
someone who understands the pressures of living amid the constant scrutiny that 
comes with being a Presley. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that the wedding has been confirmed, most people can't get enough of the 
story -- even though it has nothing to do with why we care about Jackson in the 
first place: his artistry. 
</P>
<P>
 The danger for Jackson is that all this public fascination could further 
obscure his own creative focus and destroy any lingering musical credibility. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, Jackson has seemed as interested in appearing in the tabloids 
as on the charts. The funny thing is that the whole story of the marriage was 
laid out weeks ago in the tabloids but that no one took it seriously. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason that the mainstream press laid off the marriage rumor wasn't just 
that the Jackson advisers all denied the marriage. No one believes celebrities 
or their advisers anymore anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 This was a story that was simply too preposterous. 
</P>
<P>
 The King of Pop getting married? 
</P>
<P>
 To the daughter of the King of Rock? 
</P>
<P>
 If they made it into a movie, they'd have to put it on the Sci-Fi Channel. 
</P>
<P>
 The whole affair gives new meaning to the old Elvis hit "Suspicious Minds." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the questions raised about this unprecedented pop merger: Is it love? Is 
it public relations? Is it New Age therapy? Is it a Scientology coup? (Lisa 
Marie is a follower.) Will Graceland now become an Elvis Presley and Michael 
Jackson museum? 
</P>
<P>
 If it is difficult to make sense out of the lives of celebrities who give 
endless, contradictory interviews (yo, Roseanne!), imagine the challenge of 
figuring out the motivation of people who don't give any. 
</P>
<P>
 How do you begin piecing together the thinking behind this marriage? 
</P>
<P>
 Once the jokes run out, you begin by realizing they are two of the most 
private and famous people in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Their experience in the pop spotlight -- regardless of whether Lisa Marie has 
ever stepped on a stage -- gives them a unique bond. 
</P>
<P>
 For Lisa Marie, whose birthright and fortune may sometimes seem as much a 
burden as a blessing, Michael could stand in her eyes as someone who has spent 
his life with the same set of riches and emotional strains. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of Lisa Marie's unique appeal for Michael is her bloodline. She is one of 
the few people in the pop world who could make Michael more famous than before 
-- and you don't dub yourself the King of Pop if you're not obsessed with fame. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael believes one way to enhance your fame is to keep people curious. Elvis 
Presley and Howard Hughes were equally fascinating to him because they were 
unique . . . mysterious. One reason Michael has given for not talking to the 
press is, "Elvis didn't do interviews." 
</P>
<P>
 But there is a danger in such emphasis on fame -- and Michael's work has 
suffered from it in recent years. He seems to think that fame, rather than the 
quality of the music, is what ultimately matters. 
</P>
<P>
 Whereas there was a sense of revelation and passion in 1982's phenomenally 
successful "Thriller" album, his two subsequent albums were more commercially 
calculated than inspired. 
</P>
<P>
 The albums both seemed designed to protect his market share by appealing to 
various radio formats and pop genres. No wonder sales slipped dramatically in 
the United States. Too much of the music seemed artificial and cold. 
</P>
<P>
 It was unreasonable to think that Jackson could ever top the 20 million-plus 
sales of "Thriller" in the United States, but it was not out of line to expect 
that he could give us another album with equal heart and fire. 
</P>
<P>
 What people remember about Elvis isn't how many No. 1 records he had but his 
influence on pop music. Elvis didn't invent rock 'n' roll, but he defined it in 
ways that touched everyone from the Beatles to U2. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, it's the music that should matter in Jackson's case -- egardless of 
the inevitable fascination with his public life. 
</P>
<P>
 People close to Jackson are ecstatic about the new tracks he has made for the 
"greatest hits" album due around Nov. 1. They say it is some of the strongest 
music since "Thriller." But these are some of the same people who denied for 
weeks the marriage rumors. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, it's the quality of Jackson's music that will determine whether 
the title of King of Pop is anything more than an empty marketing slogan.

JACKSON-PRESLEY UNION SPARKS SHOCK, DOUBT, LAUGHS; MARRIAGE: CONFIRMATION THAT 
THE KING OF POP AND THE PRINCESS OF ROCK HAVE INDEED HITCHED CAUSES MANY 
REACTIONS, WITH SURPRISE TOPPING THE CHART. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Elvis Presley and Michael Jackson fans were united on one thing Tuesday: their 
shock over the confirmation of marriage of the King of Pop to the daughter of 
the King of Rock. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody ever thought they'd see the day when Michael Jackson would come 
moonwalking down Elvis Presley Boulevard," said Janis Fullilove, a radio 
talk-show host on WMC in Elvis' hometown of Memphis. 
</P>
<P>
 In Jackson's hometown of Gary, Ind., Bill James, who hosts a talk show on 
WLTH, reported that reaction to the marriage of Jackson and Lisa Marie Presley 
was skeptical. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jackson fans don't believe he's married," James said. "They think it's just 
for publicity." 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Job, president of the 367-member New Jersey State Assn. for Elvis, said 
the marriage poses a quandary. He wonders how he is going to handle the story 
in Elvis Times, the newsletter he has edited every two weeks for 12 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not going to touch it yet," Job said hesitantly by phone Tuesday. "It's 
too touchy. You have fans who are fond of Lisa and will go along with anything 
she does, and others who are not too fond of Michael's publicity, and the 
trouble he's been getting into with kids. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody's quiet," Job said of the fan club membership. "They're in shock. 
Of course, the other thing on everybody's mind is, where will Graceland fit in 
way down the road? What will Michael want to do with it?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Cynthia Horner, editorial director for the black teen magazine Right On!, 
doesn't think Michael married Lisa Marie just to get his gloves on Graceland, 
or even to improve his negative public image. 
</P>
<P>
 "Michael can get publicity anytime he wants," said Horner, who has known the 
pop star since 1976. "It's not necessary for him to take this route to try and 
beef up his reputation. He's too private of a person. 
</P>
<P>
 "I talked to Michael in April, and at that time he indicated he was looking 
for a wife, and I told him to look for someone equally as famous and wealthy as 
he is, so he wouldn't have to worry about someone marrying him just for his 
money." 
</P>
<P>
 Upon hearing her advice, Horner reported that Jackson "just smiled." 
</P>
<P>
 At Tower Records in Hollywood Monday evening, reaction to the Jackson-Presley 
nuptials was more cynical. 
</P>
<P>
 As Calvin Pixley, 37, said: "I don't see love there. Did they get married 
because they're both famous? I think she really admired (Jackson's) fame -- her 
father being so famous and all -- and she fell in love with his art, his fame." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's nonsense," said Darrin Tehrani, 29, a musician who credited both Jackson 
and Presley among his influences. "Even if it's true, what are their motives? 
They're two oddballs and this whole thing is a mess. I'm probably going to have 
bad dreams about this." 
</P>
<P>
 On KROQ's morning drive-time show, hosts Kevin and Bean spent Tuesday fielding 
listener theories on how and why the King of Pop and the Princess of Rock got 
together. 
</P>
<P>
 Bean thought Kevin's idea was by far the weirdest. 
</P>
<P>
 "He actually thinks that maybe they like each other." 
</P>
<P>
 Acknowledged Kevin: "It's refreshing to not consider that they're just doing 
it for the money . . . unlike Tom and Roseanne or Anna Nicole (Smith) and 
grandpa."

GOODWILL GAMES; WHERE'S ICE? COMPETITORS WERE ASKING; SKATING: UNUSUALLY WARM 
TEMPERATURES SABOTAGE ORGANIZERS' ABILITY TO GET RINKS READY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Located on the Gulf of Finland, divided into islands by branches of the Neva 
River, St. Petersburg has long been ruled by its relationship to water. But 
during the Goodwill Games, it has not been a benevolent despot. Organizers have 
found it difficult to swim in, sail on or even freeze. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten days after the swimming competition was postponed for 24 hours because of 
a calamity involving the pool's filtration system, two other events had to be 
rescheduled Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 And when organizers arrived at Yubileiny early this morning, they were 
disappointed to discover that the ice in the main rink still was not thick 
enough for the figure skaters. According to sources within the organizing 
committee, they would announce later in the morning that the first night of 
figure skating competition would be moved from the 7,000-seat Yubileiny to the 
2,400-seat SKA Ice Palace. 
</P>
<P>
 Rescheduling events is not unusual for the yachting competitors, who, as was 
the case at the Central Yacht Club, often have too little wind for their sails. 
With an afternoon breeze, they were in the water after only a two-hour delay. 
</P>
<P>
 But there was nothing normal about Tuesday for the short track speed skaters, 
who did not know until 1 1/2 hours before they went onto the ice where, when or 
even whether they were going to compete. 
</P>
<P>
 Jack Kelly, Goodwill Games president, said both the sailors and the speed 
skaters were victims of the elements, a still morning in the case of the former 
and an unrelenting heat wave in the case of the latter. "Like acts of God," he 
said. But there was a suspicion among speed skating officials and athletes that 
humans also contributed to their predicament. 
</P>
<P>
 The ice follies began Sunday when a power outage in the section of the city 
where the Yubileiny Sport Palace, the scheduled site for speed skating and 
figure skating, is located. That forced the building's engineer to postpone his 
ice-making arrangements in the main rink, and began turning the ice of the 
practice rink into slush. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday brought Day 10 of temperatures in the high 80s, sustained heat 
virtually unprecedented in St. Petersburg. As Yubileiny is not air-conditioned, 
the engineer discovered by mid-afternoon that the water on the floor of the 
main rink was remaining wet. His response was to borrow the refrigeration 
system from the practice rink, which was immediately closed. 
</P>
<P>
 That decision met with no resistance from the skaters, who already had given 
up trying to accomplish anything on it. 
</P>
<P>
 While the figure skaters were transferred to another rink for practices Monday 
afternoon, the speed skaters were told that they would compete as scheduled 
Tuesday, beginning at 2 p.m. To anyone who had seen the Yubileiny rink, that 
seemed impossible. But Kelly told the Russian organizers to make it happen or 
face the same ridicule they received over their brown pool water. 
</P>
<P>
 If the organizing committee's president, Anatoly Sobchak, like the captain of 
the Titanic, who also had a problem with ice, had kept a log Tuesday, it would 
have read something like this: 
</P>
<P>
 -- 10:30 a.m.: At the daily news briefing, St. Petersburg's deputy mayor, 
Vitali Mutko, says: "So far, so good. Everything is taking place in orderly 
fashion." 
</P>
<P>
 -- 10:31 a.m.: Mutko reveals two postponements, the yachting from 11 a.m. to 1 
p.m. and the speed skating from 2 p.m. to 8 p.m. Kelly says that the ice at 
Yubileiny is 1 1/2 centimeters thick, about half as thick as necessary for 
speed skating, and that it probably would be ready by 2 p.m. "But we don't want 
to risk it," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 -- 12:30 p.m.: After some discussion with security guards, who chased an 
inquiring ABC television producer and her camera operator out of the building 
Monday, reporters are allowed into the Yubileiny rink, where they find no ice. 
It looks like a driveway after a rainstorm. There is a slab of concrete with 
some puddles. 
</P>
<P>
 -- 4 p.m.: Officials decide to meet two hours later at Yubileiny to determine 
whether the speed skating competition can proceed as rescheduled. 
</P>
<P>
 -- 6 p.m.: Officials convene at the rink only to be asked to leave the 
building by security guards who are about to begin their daily check of the 
building for bombs.  
</P>
<P>
 -- 6:20 p.m.: When the officials return, they discover that there is still not 
more than one centimeter of ice. "I felt like I was present at my own funeral," 
says Alexander Kozlovsky, vice president of the Russian Olympic Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 -- 7 p.m.: Officials announce that the speed skating competition will begin in 
one hour four blocks away at a small ice hockey rink, the SKA Ice Palace. 
Spectators arriving at Yubileiny will be bused over. Speed skaters want to 
know: Couldn't they have made that decision yesterday?  
</P>
<P>
 -- 8:05 p.m.: One entrance into the building is open, sponsors' advertising 
banners are slung over the sideboards and Kelly's interpreter, David O'Hara, is 
helping put up pads. Kelly tells reporters that they should not blame the 
organizers for this glitch. 
</P>
<P>
 -- 9:40 p.m. Before a crowd of about 1,600 in the 2,400-seat arena, the 
competition finally begins with the men's 500. The United States' best hope, 
Andy Gabel, falls early. He says the confusion over the site was distracting 
and the ice is too soft for speed skaters.

OWNERS' LIST OF CLUBS LOSING MONEY DECRIED; BASEBALL: THE DODGERS AND WHITE SOX 
ARE AMONG THE 19 CLUBS ALLEGED TO BE HAVING FINANCIAL TROUBLE, A SOURCE SAYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Two of baseball's most stable and successful franchises, the Dodgers and the 
Chicago White Sox, are among the 19 teams that Richard Ravitch, the owners' 
chief labor negotiator, claims will lose money in 1994, a lawyer close to the 
collective bargaining said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "That just shows how phony the list is," said the lawyer, who asked not to be 
identified. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Ravitch nor Don Fehr, executive director of the players' union, would 
confirm or deny inclusion of the Dodgers and White Sox on the list. Fehr said 
he is bound by a confidentiality agreement signed when Ravitch turned over 
financial records of the clubs earlier in the summer. 
</P>
<P>
 In alluding to alleged economic problems and the need for a new compensation 
system based on a salary cap, Ravitch has frequently said 19 teams will lose 
money this year and included those projections in the material given to the 
union. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not getting into individual economics or specific clubs," he said 
Tuesday, acknowledging that projections aren't always on target. "The union has 
all the figures. As I've said many times, you don't have to prove poverty to be 
entitled to know your cost of labor. All we want to know is what it's going to 
cost to play ball." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Fehr: "Ravitch knows that if he revealed the 19 teams, people would laugh 
at him, which is the reason he won't do it. (The list) just shows how 
preposterous their allegation (of a widespread economic problem) is. He knows 
the figures don't support it." 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Sam Fernandez, the Dodgers' general counsel, nor Fred Claire, their 
executive vice president, would discuss the club's financial situation. Owner 
Peter O'Malley is on a business trip to Nicaragua. The Dodgers, with a player 
payroll of about $36 million, are expected to surpass 3.4 million in 
attendance, barring a work stoppage. 
</P>
<P>
 White Sox owner Jerry Reinsdorf said through a secretary Tuesday that he did 
not want to discuss labor issues, but Sunday he had said: 
</P>
<P>
 "I can survive under the (current) system. I don't like it, but I can survive. 
We're a big market, and we have a good ballpark and a good lease. I can't speak 
for anybody else, but I would surmise there are a handful of teams in the 
position we are, making some money . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 Who is to be believed, asked the lawyer familiar with the negotiations, 
Reinsdorf or Ravitch and his projected list of 1994 money losers? 
</P>
<P>
 Interim commissioner Bud Selig said: "We have not and will not identify the 
individual clubs, but I actually think another one or two could lose money this 
year (taking the list to 20 or 21 of the 28). I'm talking about money in, money 
out. Actual figures. The thing I resent most in all of the years I've been in 
baseball is the suggestion that we've cooked the books. Is someone suggesting 
that all the accounting firms in America are part of a conspiracy? 
</P>
<P>
 "The (economic) study committee had the figures for two years, and neither the 
union's representatives nor ours questioned the accuracy. I understand that 
people don't want to hear bad news, but the distress in this industry is 
greater than in all my 20 or so years combined. For too many years, we talked 
about doing something about it tomorrow. Well, tomorrow is here." 
</P>
<P>
 The union, seeking to maintain the status quo, cites industry revenue of $1.8 
billion and projected attendance again of more than 70 million. If revenue 
streams have changed, Fehr contends, then change the revenue-sharing formula 
without linking it to a salary cap, which forces the players to pay for the 
contributions of the big markets to the small markets. He also suggests that 
bad management and bad marketing might be as responsible for the alleged 
problems as is salary growth. 
</P>
<P>
 Faced with the players' Aug. 12 strike date, talks resume in New York today 
with no hint of a compromise. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, both sides seemed to dismiss the possibility of a settlement based 
on the union giving up salary arbitration in exchange for a reduction in 
free-agent eligibility from six years to three or four and the owners giving up 
the salary cap. 
</P>
<P>
 Selig and Ravitch said the clubs want to get rid of salary arbitration -- the 
91 players who filed last winter showed an overall salary increase of 80%. But 
Selig added that without a salary cap or a designated percentage of revenue 
going to salaries, "the elimination of arbitration alone wouldn't make that 
much of a difference, the distress is so great." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Ravitch: "Most of the clubs are moving in that direction anyway, buying 
out arbitration by signing their best young players to long-term contracts." 
</P>
<P>
 Fehr said he would listen closely to a proposal eliminating arbitration and 
liberalizing free agency if the clubs could guarantee a market devoid of 
collusion. He said, however, that he doubted the clubs would ever propose the 
elimination of arbitration and liberalizing of free agency because it would 
further damage the small-market teams. 
</P>
<P>
 "If a team doesn't have the option of tendering arbitration," he said, "a 
Pittsburgh, for instance, could lose Barry Bonds after two or three years 
(depending on the adopted rule) rather than the current six. If the clubs ever 
make that proposal, you'll know the big-market teams have won everything."

 An American couple -- we'll call them Ted and Jane -- meet over vodka with a

 Boris: "What is glitch ?" 
</P>
<P>
 Natasha: "A problem, darling."

 Boris: "Then I will have him arrested." 
</P>
<P>
 Natasha: "Glitch is not person, darling." 
</P>
<P>
 Ted: "It's something gone wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 Jane: "Like a green swimming pool?" 
</P>
<P>
 Ted: "OK, so the water was a little green." 
</P>
<P>
 Jane: "Green as Castro's pajamas." 
</P>
<P>
 Ted: "So? You can't swim in green water?" 
</P>
<P>
 Jane: "Sure. If you're a crocodile."

 Ted: "Oh, some judge wasn't looking, took a javelin like a spear." 
</P>
<P>
 Jane: "Almost turned him into a corn dog." 
</P>
<P>
 Boris: "What was judge's name?" 
</P>
<P>
 Natasha: "Kabob." 
</P>
<P>
 Ted: "Well, there won't be any glitches at the Atlanta Olympics, I guarantee 
you." 
</P>
<P>
 Boris: "No green pools?" 
</P>
<P>
 Ted: "Only outdoors." 
</P>
<P>
 Jane: "Too bad Russia missed the L.A. Olympics." 
</P>
<P>
 Boris: "Yes, we let you win basketball." 
</P>
<P>
 Ted: "Let us win?" 
</P>
<P>
 Boris: "You have no competition."

</P>
<P>
 Ted: "Yeah." 
</P>
<P>
 Boris: "Who is on it?"

 Boris: "Yes, we can defeat this team." 
</P>
<P>
 Ted: "How can you say that?" 
</P>
<P>

five." 
</P>
<P>
 Jane: "Well, too bad." 
</P>
<P>
 Boris: "Too bad what?" 
</P>
<P>
 Jane: "Too bad Russia's all cut up into 11 or 12 different countries now." 
</P>
<P>
 Ted: "Yeah, too bad." 
</P>
<P>
 Jane: "Better stick to hockey." 
</P>
<P>
 Boris: "But perhaps your U.S. Olympic athletes will go on strike in 1996, like 
your baseball athletes." 
</P>
<P>
 Ted: "Go on strike?" 
</P>
<P>

 Ted: "Never happen."

<P>
 Boris: "Excuse, please. U.S. athletes now paid out in open, yes?" 
</P>
<P>
 Ted: "Yes." 
</P>
<P>
 Boris: "None of this 'amateur' nonsense?" 
</P>
<P>
 Ted: "No." 
</P>
<P>
 Boris: "Good! By 1996, U.S. athletes will demand many more millions of dollars 
and Russia will win swimming and gymnastics and basketball!"

<P>
 Boris: "Yeah!"

WHO KNEW THEY WOULD BE HOME?; BASEBALL: PROBLEMS AT KINGDOME LEAD TO UNEXPECTED 
GAMES AT ANAHEIM STADIUM AND 11,478 TAKE ADVANTAGE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 It was an appropriate setting for this meeting of the American League's 
losingest teams, a couple of clubs down on their luck and virtually homeless. 
</P>
<P>
 The Seattle Mariners, major league's answer to Chicken Little, are fleeing the 
Kingdome where the roof is literally caving in on a season that began with high 
expectations and has deteriorated into yet another exercise in ineptitude. And 
the Angels, intruders in their own ballpark, are running on empty in the shadow 
of the contenders for the dubious title of American League West champion. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe a work stoppage isn't such a bad idea. 
</P>
<P>
 For now, however, the game must go on. But not in Seattle, where a ceiling 
tile might really spoil someone's day. And not in triple-A Tacoma, which might 
have been a more suitable venue for the kind of baseball played by the Mariners 
and Angels, who have managed to combine for 17 losses in the past 12 days. 
</P>
<P>
 So it was "Batter up," Tuesday night in Anaheim Stadium -- home of Yankee 
fans, Red Sox faithful, Tiger lovers and even an occasional Angel supporter -- 
where 11,478 took advantage of the opportunity to buy box seats for $6. 
</P>
<P>
 Tickets went on sale Friday morning and reached 6,000 by Wednesday afternoon. 
Angel officials were pleased by the walk-up sales which pretty much filled out 
the only level open, the field level, between the foul poles. Two hours before 
the game, box seats were still available a few feet beyond first or third base 
and just a dozen rows back from the field. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Aronson, a Red Sox cap pushed back on his forehead, ordered tickets by 
phone on Friday afternoon. He and his wife, Toby, son, Jesse, 15, and daughter, 
Leah, 13, were excited about their seats five rows behind home plate. 
</P>
<P>
 "The kids have never sat this close and they're always saying they can't see 
what's going on when we sit up there," Aronson said, pointing to the vacant 
upper deck.  
</P>
<P>
 The Aronsons, who left Boston to relocate in Riverside eight years ago, admit 
that they are among those who have turned Anaheim Stadium into a home away from 
home for teams such as Boston, New York and Detroit and they make no apologies. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard for us to give up the Red Sox because we've rooted for them all our 
lives," Toby Aronson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It makes me mad when I hear the Angels complaining about the fans here 
rooting for other teams," Steve said. "I have the right to root for whoever I 
want. If they want the fans to cheer for them, let them field a good team. I 
think it's the fans who deserve better treatment, not the players." 
</P>
<P>
 Foul balls, a chance at an autograph or simply a glimpse of a face under a 
batting helmet drew most of Tuesday night's fans to these close-to-the-action 
vantage points. Many were so unfamiliar with their choice seats they didn't 
even know what to do with the ever-present beachballs.  
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, however, they got their money's worth. Ken Griffey Jr. hit his 37th 
home run in the seventh inning. Bo Jackson was ejected in the fourth. And Chili 
Davis broke a bat over his knee. 
</P>
<P>
 Shawnna Seidl, who was in the first row behind the Mariners' on-deck circle, 
came from Rialto with her boyfriend, Jonathon Miller, with an unusual mission. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope there are some big arguments," she said. "I want to hear what they 
really say to the umpires." 
</P>
<P>
 She got half of her wish when home plate umpire Al Clark threw out Jackson for 
arguing a called third strike. But Jackson's vocabulary didn't carry the 40 or 
so feet to their seats. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody was screaming so loud, we couldn't hear a thing," Miller said, 
obviously disappointed. 
</P>
<P>
 Oh well, if it was cursing they sought, surely the Angel fans in the vicinity 
had already provided it. By the time Jackson was heaving baseballs and bags of 
sunflower seeds onto the field, Seattle led the first game of this Adventures 
in Futility Series, 5-1.

PRO FOOTBALL DAILY REPORT; RAMS; NEGOTIATIONS WITH HENLEY PLANNED

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Rams planned to begin negotiations with free agent cornerback Darryl 
Henley's agent Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams must offer Henley, who was paid $600,000 by the team last season 
despite missing 11 games, a minimum of $162,000 to play this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Henley, who is facing felony drug charges and a Jan. 10 trial date, has been 
cleared by NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue to play this season. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will make him an offer," said John Shaw, Ram president. "I think all 
things being equal he would prefer playing here. But he's a free agent and 
maybe somebody else will outbid us for his services." 
</P>
<P>
 Shaw said the team is not concerned about safety issues surrounding Henley's 
return, although a year ago Henley was pursued by armed assailants at Rams 
Park. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the organization felt there was a safety-security risk then that would be 
an issue in signing him," Shaw said. "But we don't feel there is any 
safety-security issue here. All of the safety issues that kind of existed in 
the past were really resolved with the arrest of the parties that were creating 
the disturbances." 
</P>
<P>
 And what about the public's reaction to Henley's return to the team while 
awaiting a trial for cocaine possession and conspiring to distribute the drug. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that's an issue the league considered at the time of their 
reinstatement," Shaw said. "I think if the commissioner's office felt that 
there was an overriding integrity-of-the-league issue he would not have been 
reinstated."

OWNERS MISS UNION PAYMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSS NEWHAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Don Fehr, the baseball players' union executive director, said Tuesday his 
organization had not received a $7 million to $8 million pension payment from 
the owners due Aug. 1 from All-Star game receipts. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Ravitch, the owners' chief negotiator, said the decision to withhold 
the payment was understandable since technically there is no bargaining 
agreement in place, but Eugene Orza, the union's associate general counsel, 
called it "an all-time low" and couldn't predict how the players would react.

L.A. BLADES' CHARRON IS MAN FROM UNCLES; HOCKEY: WITH JIM CRAIG AND HIS 
BROTHERS SERVING AS MENTORS, CENTER LEARNED ABOUT SKATING AND LIFE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Craig Charron had retired from hockey by the time his uncle's team defeated 
the Soviet Union in one of the United States' greatest victories on the ice. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd been playing hockey since I was 6," Charron recalls. "I got sick of it. I 
took a year off when I was 11." 
</P>
<P>
 That was 1980, and from the rafter seats at Lake Placid, N.Y., Charron watched 
U.S. goalie Jim Craig -- Uncle Jim -- shut out the Soviets for 10 of the 
longest minutes in Olympic history. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States won, 4-3, and, high atop the stands, a career was reborn. 
</P>
<P>
 Charron, with his mother, Anne, Jim's oldest sister, remembers thinking: "This 
is a pretty good sport." 
</P>
<P>
 Back in Easton, Mass., after a hero's welcome parade for the whole Craig 
family, Charron unretired. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 One-quarter inch might be as tall as this paragraph. People grow that much on 
an inhale. 
</P>
<P>
 But to Craig Charron, the newly rediscovered spark in the L.A. Blades' roller 
hockey offense, one-quarter inch is the distance between him and a straight-out 
lie. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm 5-foot-9 3/4 to be honestly truthful," Charron says. "I always say I'm 
5-10, because, you know, I hate saying three-quarters all the time. But I'm 
actually nine and three-quarters." 
</P>
<P>
 In 11 games with the Blades since returning from an injury, Charron has 19 
goals and 15 assists, and has led the Blades to the best record in Roller 
Hockey International. 
</P>
<P>
 Charron is like countless players in hockey's minor leagues and RHI -- a tick 
too slow. A nod short on fundamentals. An ounce lacking in want-to. 
</P>
<P>
 Charron was born to be a shrug short of 5-10, which to Anne Charron meant he 
could quit right away, which he tried, or could work that much harder. 
</P>
<P>
 That's the lesson Anne Charron taught her brothers and sisters -- Jim Craig 
among them -- when their mother died. The same lesson she passed on to her 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 "My mother was the driving force behind my hockey," Charron says. "I was 
always kind of a late bloomer, always smaller than the guys I was on the ice 
with. 
</P>
<P>
 "Smaller guys try harder."  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The swamp was about one-quarter inch short of perfect. 
</P>
<P>
 Shallow and thick with vegetation, it froze weeks before any body of water 
deserving of the title "pond" in Easton, Mass. Reeds from the murky water stuck 
up through the ice all winter, creating perfect, built-in cone drills. 
</P>
<P>
 And the swamp was right behind the house that the Craigs called home. 
</P>
<P>
 Anne, Jim and the rest of the Craigs grew up in that house next to that swamp, 
surrounded by other houses filled with aunts and uncles and assorted relatives. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim, Dan and Kevin had the swamp on their own terms. But Anne, the oldest and 
self-appointed matriarch after their mother's death, ran the house. 
</P>
<P>
 "My mother was pretty much the mother to her brother and sisters," Charron 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 When Anne Craig married Maurice Charron, she moved from the Craig house to the 
one next door. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim, Dan and Kevin were still playing hockey on the swamp when young Craig 
arrived. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's how my stick skills got so good," Charron says. "My uncles would take 
the puck and they wouldn't let me go in until I got it away from them. And that 
would always seem to take an hour. Then they would make me take it and I would 
try to keep it from them. So I got good at keeping the puck away from bigger 
guys." 
</P>
<P>
 Says Jim Craig: "We started him in our basement. When he was ready, we moved 
him to pond hockey. My brothers and I tried to be his mentor." 
</P>
<P>
 Charron says he thought of them more as brothers than uncles. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were the ones I played hockey with and they looked out for me," he 
recalls. 
</P>
<P>
 One by one, the uncles left to play college hockey, Dan to Massachusetts 
Lowell, Jim to Boston University and Olympic fame. That left the pond to Craig, 
and Craig to Anne. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Under Anne's urging and needling, Craig was a local standout entering high 
school. 
</P>
<P>
 But she died from cancer in Craig's sophomore year. 
</P>
<P>
 "After she passed away, I felt like I had to take care of my brothers and 
sisters," Charron says. "They'd sneak out late past my dad, then I'd be the one 
staying up, waiting. I'd say, 'Where have you been?' And they'd say, 'You're 
not my father!' 
</P>
<P>
 "But my mom took care of her brothers and sisters after their mom died, I felt 
like I had to look out for mine." 
</P>
<P>
 Which left who to look out for Craig? 
</P>
<P>
 "My brothers and I took him under our wing," Jim Craig says. 
</P>
<P>
 In college, Charron once needed money for books. "I was real embarrassed to 
call Jim, but he said, 'If you had gone to somebody besides me, I would have 
been so mad at you,' " Charron says. 
</P>
<P>
 Dan helped Craig get admitted to Massachusetts Lowell, where he played as a 
walk-on. Charron started all four years. 
</P>
<P>
 "My coach at BU said that he was the biggest steal Lowell ever got," Jim says. 
"Its frustrating for me and for Craig. There isn't a team in the NHL that could 
not use him." 
</P>
<P>
 But the NHL does not take seriously centers listed at 5-10 who insist it's 
closer to 5-9 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here's a guy who's all heart and only wants to play," Craig says. "You want 
to see a guy like that make it."

SURFING GOES LONG; RETURN OF LONGBOARDS BRINGS NEW WAVE OF RIDERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE REILLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Back in 1988, a rebellious Dave Parmenter paddled out for his heat at the Op 
Pro surfing championships on a longboard, prompting laughter from contest 
judges and the fans on the beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Who was Parmenter kidding? 
</P>
<P>
 No way could someone riding a heavy 9 1/2-foot longboard compete against the 
sharp-cutting, six-foot shortboards at the prestigious Op Pro. 
</P>
<P>
 Parmenter couldn't keep up, losing his heat by several points to Australia's 
Richard Marsh. 
</P>
<P>
 But afterward, Parmenter claimed victory by sending a message to the surfing 
world that day at the Huntington Beach Pier. 
</P>
<P>
 "I did it in protest of the flapping, kicking and waving of paddling gloves 
that is being bred into modern (shortboard) surfers," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Somebody must have been listening. 
</P>
<P>
 Six years after Parmenter's off-the-cuff protest, longboard riding has 
attracted a new wave of surfers, both young and old, to competitions such as 
the U.S. Open, which started Tuesday at the pier. 
</P>
<P>
 Gone are the 50-pound redwood longboards surfers rode in the 1950s and early 
'60s. Technology has produced lightweight foam and fiberglass boards that allow 
surfers to duplicate shortboard maneuvers without sacrificing traditional 
longboard moves such as noserides. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, the faster, lighter longboards have brought the baby boomers back 
to the beach . . . and they're bringing their kids with them. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're just starting to see the first generation of kids riding longboards," 
said Corky Carroll, an Orange County surfing legend and U.S. longboard champion 
in the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
 "The guys like Joel Tudor and Joey Hawkins are the first group to start riding 
the (newer) longboards. For years it was my generation that dominated the 
longboard contests. Now there's a whole new group, and they're really, really 
good." 
</P>
<P>
 Tudor, an 18-year-old from San Diego, won the Op Pro longboard contest Sunday 
at the pier. He's among 70 longboard surfers, ages 17 to 55, competing with 
veterans such as Carroll and David Nuuhiwa today at the U.S. Open, which also 
features divisions for shortboard riders, bodyboarders and women. 
</P>
<P>
 Even some pro shortboard surfers are giving longboards a try this week. San 
Clemente's Dino Andino and Shane Beschen, Chris Frohoff of Redondo Beach and 
Ted Robinson of Manhattan Beach are entered in the longboard event. 
</P>
<P>
 But the renewed interest in longboard riding stretches far beyond the pro surf 
contests. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Kingsbury, spokesman for the Surf Industry Manufacturers Assn., said an 
estimated 1.5 million people in the United States surf, and participation in 
the sport has grown at a rate of 10% a year. Longboard sales have increased 20% 
a year during the last two years, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Carroll, who manages Wind N Sea surfboards in Huntington Beach, said he sells 
"50 longboards for every one shortboard." 
</P>
<P>
 "If you are over 20 years old and you don't surf everyday," he said, "you need 
a longboard to surf in smaller waves. All the 17- or 18-year-old kids who are 
out there all the time control the (larger-wave) lineup with shortboards." 
</P>
<P>
 Surfers abandoned the longboard in the late 1960s for the new, sleek 
shortboards that were easier to maneuver. As technology improved over the 
years, shortboards became lighter, faster and more adaptable to constantly 
changing wave conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was one of the first guys to have a shortboard," Carroll said. "They were 
out on the market by 1968, and longboards were just dead for the next several 
years." 
</P>
<P>
 That decline in popularity ultimately created a generation gap in the surfing 
world. 
</P>
<P>
 Traditionalists rode longboards; their kids were hoping for a shortboard under 
the tree on Christmas Day. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, who wants to ride a longboard that your old man was cruising around 
on every weekend? Kids' taste in surfboards was like their taste in cars: Why 
drive an Impala when you could have a Camaro? 
</P>
<P>
 They wanted something fast, something fun. They needed a shortboard. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, longboard surfers were stereotyped as old men with beer guts 
hanging over their canvas shorts, slowly paddling into the waves and causing a 
hazard for shortboard riders. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert "Wingnut" Weaver was one of the twentysomething surfers who bridged 
that generation gap. He grew up in Newport Beach riding longboards while his 
friends surfed shortboards. 
</P>
<P>
 Weaver's longboard riding skills eventually landed him a part in filmmaker 
Bruce Brown's "The Endless Summer II," a sequel to Brown's 1964 classic. 
</P>
<P>
 Weaver, 28, always rode a longboard, refusing to try the shorter version. He 
considers himself a surfing purist, a link from the legends who rode the 
longboard before him to the kids he hopes will ride it in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole style of longboarding appealed to me," he said. "It was a different 
approach to surfing, and I had always been into the 1950s and '60s. And surfing 
just captured that era so well." 
</P>
<P>
 Robert August, who starred in the original "Endless Summer," owns a Huntington 
Beach surf shop and shaped the 25 longboards Weaver used in the movie. 
</P>
<P>
 "Wingnut was the first of the young guys to really dedicate himself to riding 
the longboard," August said. "Before him, it was mainly older guys like me 
riding them. Now, younger kids are finding that you can have fun on them when 
the waves are three-feet high and mushy." 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't until the late 1980s that longboards went on a crash diet, dropping 
from 50 pounds to 11 and 12. Longboard shapers traded the redwood models and 
heavy balsa-wood boards for lightweight foam covered with a single layer of 
fiberglass and stylish designs. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like anything else," Carroll said. "As time goes along, there is 
progress and improvements in a product. That's what happened with longboards. 
It's like a long chain -- we had to build it in links." 
</P>
<P>
 Carroll said the longboards he sells are six inches shorter than the boards he 
rode in the 1960s. A new longboard sells for about $500, about $100 to $200 
more than a custom shortboard. 
</P>
<P>
 But surfers say the new longboards are worth the price. The boards are 
custom-built and the lightweight foam allows riders to pull 360-degree turns 
and ride "floaters" over the top of the wave, just like shortboard riders do. 
Those moves were impossible with the old, heavy boards. 
</P>
<P>
 The newer boards also easier to store, load and carry to the beach. Carroll 
remembers getting a workout just lugging his old, heavy boards to the pier. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I started surfing, the first longboard I rode weighed about 50 pounds," 
he said. "And I weighed only about 40 pounds." 
</P>
<P>
 Carroll rides a lightweight board now, trying to keep up with a younger 
generation at a surf break he once dominated. 
</P>
<P>
 He knows the rebirth of longboard riding has been slow, and the sport still 
has a long way to go before it catches shortboards in popularity. 
</P>
<P>
 Prize money and endorsements for longboarders are only a fraction of the 
hundreds of thousands of dollars that top shortboard riders such as Kelly 
Slater earn each year. 
</P>
<P>
 But Carroll sees a promising future for the sport. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's amazing," he said "I watched all of the Op contest last week and the 
longboard competition seemed to be more interesting. 
</P>
<P>
 "You saw the final day. The crowd seemed to show more interest in 
longboarding. I think there's just a lot of appeal with it because anybody at 
any age can do it."

GOLF / STEVE ELLING; FOR BUTTITTA, AIR TIME GIVES WAY TO TEE TIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Joe Buttitta had no idea what he had done or how he'd done it. 
</P>
<P>
 He simply signed up for a golf class in college, somebody handed him a 
left-handed seven-iron and he took a whack, using his best baseball swing. 
</P>
<P>
 The ball sailed high and true, into the blue yonder. He spent the next few 
weeks trying to duplicate the feat. 
</P>
<P>
 "I topped it, hit it fat, hooked it, sliced it," Buttitta said. "I just wanted 
to hit it as good as I did that very first time." 
</P>
<P>
 Like every beginner who picked up an infernal club, he couldn't. Buttitta 
didn't know it at the time, but the hook had been set. 
</P>
<P>
 Three decades later, Buttitta is fast approaching a point where golf will move 
from avocation to vocation. 
</P>
<P>
 Buttitta, a television sportscaster with a considerable athletic background in 
the San Fernando Valley, now wants more than anything to become a PGA club 
professional. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm deadly serious," he said. "I know exactly what I want. Maybe for the 
first time." 
</P>
<P>
 Talk about shifting gears. Then again, Buttitta, who lives in Simi Valley, has 
changed directions successfully many times before. Not always by choice. 
</P>
<P>
 Buttitta was a triple-threat athlete as a kid in the Valley and later played 
basketball and baseball at Notre Dame High before enrolling at San Fernando 
Valley State, which became Cal State Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 As a journalism graduate from Northridge, Buttitta became a media 
triple-threat too. He has worked at each of Los Angeles' independent television 
stations, done extensive work in radio broadcasting and writes a weekly golf 
column for the L.A. Daily News. 
</P>
<P>
 He is the evening sports anchor at KADY-TV in Oxnard, a full-time job. He 
gives golf lessons each morning at Westlake Village Golf Course, a full-time 
job. Sleeping is not a full-time job. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm busy," he said. "The days are long, but I really love (teaching)." 
</P>
<P>
 At 52, he is long in the tooth compared to most golfers attempting to become 
certified as PGA pros. He began the process in May by passing his skills test, 
which is based on his playing ability. He also is taking courses relating to 
the business and marketing end of the sport. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was a grandpa compared to most of the guys in my classes," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Buttitta, who is classified as a PGA apprentice, hopes to become certified 
over the next couple of years and land a position as the club pro at a nice, 
posh country club. 
</P>
<P>
 When he first picked up that fateful seven-iron in a physical education class 
back around 1960, Buttitta thought golf was a "sissy sport." Now, he thinks 
otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
 From frenetic, live television to genteel, gentleman golfer. Can it be so, 
Joe? 
</P>
<P>
 Buttitta, who has broadcast everything from UCLA to the Angels, has worked at 
more stations than he cares to remember. The media rat race can wear on a guy. 
So can the attendant company line. 
</P>
<P>
 "They don't always give you a reason (for letting you go)," he said. "It was 
usually something like, 'Joe, we've just decided to make a change.' " 
</P>
<P>
 His first metamorphosis took place in the early 1960s, when Buttitta left a 
mark as an athlete at Northridge -- primarily because he could rarely hit the 
mark. Buttitta, a left-handed outfielder and first baseman, was forced to pitch 
because of a dearth of arms. 
</P>
<P>
 He still holds the Matador record for most walks issued in a season with 76, 
set in 1962. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really wish somebody would break that," he said. "Am I really the worst 
there ever was? I guess I was the Ryne Duren of my time." 
</P>
<P>
 An assistant with the Matador baseball program at the time was Dick Enberg, 
who achieved a considerable measure of fame as a sportscaster in his own right. 
Enberg worked with the Matador pitchers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I drove him into broadcasting," Buttitta said. 
</P>
<P>
 Buttitta also drove batters crazy with his lack of control. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were a lot of times he had to go longer in the game than he should 
have," said Bob Hiegert, the team's starting shortstop. "We didn't have much 
choice. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can say that there were quite a few balls that were hit very hard." 
</P>
<P>
 Hiegert, the athletic director at Northridge, grew up with Buttitta and both 
graduated from Notre Dame High in 1959. Hiegert later coached the Northridge 
baseball team. Buttitta served as an assistant in the mid-1970s with the 
Northridge . . . golf team. 
</P>
<P>
 Even then, he'd begun gravitating to the sport. Once Buttitta establishes 
himself as a club pro, he aspires to play in selected Senior PGA Tour events in 
the region. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've fallen head-over-heels in love with the game," he said. "I wake up every 
morning and go to the golf course and I'm excited about it. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't get any better than that." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 'Tis still the season: While a handful of major national amateur events 
already have been staged, there are plenty more in the hopper. Qualifying 
tournaments for three of the top United States Golf Assn. events are scheduled 
this month at area courses. 
</P>
<P>
 * On Monday, qualifying events for the U.S. Amateur will be played at four 
sites in California, including Wood Ranch Country Club in Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Amateur is Aug. 22-28 at the Tournament Players Course at Sawgrass in 
Ponte Vedra, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 * On Aug. 19, a U.S. Women's Mid-Amateur qualifier will be played at El 
Caballero Country Club in Tarzana. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mid-Amateur tournament is scheduled for Sept. 10-15 at Tacoma Golf and 
Country Club in Tacoma, Wash. Mid-amateur events, which have grown increasingly 
popular over the past decade, are for players aged 25 or older. 
</P>
<P>
 * On Aug. 30, Spanish Hills Country Club in Camarillo will stage a U.S. 
Mid-Amateur qualifier for men. 
</P>
<P>
 The championship will be played Sept. 17-22 at two sites in the Twin Cities 
area in Minnesota: Hazeltine National Golf Course in Chaska and Wayzata Country 
Club in Wayzata. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 They're baaaack: Nick Price and Greg Norman, the two top-rated PGA 
professionals, again will play as a team in the Franklin Funds Shark Shootout 
at Sherwood Country Club in Thousand Oaks on Nov. 15-20. 
</P>
<P>
 The Shootout, hosted by Norman, features two-man teams playing under three 
different formats over 54 holes. Last fall, Norman and Price caught fire in the 
final round under the scramble format and shot a tournament-record 55, only to 
finish three shots behind Ray Floyd and Steve Elkington, who will return to 
defend their title.

HOBO; LAID OFF FROM HIS JOB, CANOGA PARK'S BOOTHE KEPT PAYCHECKS COMING ON 
SENIOR BOWLING TOUR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANA HADDAD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It could be destiny, coincidence or just dumb luck. Whatever it is, Hobo 
Boothe will take it and not give it a second thought. 
</P>
<P>
 Boothe, a 57-year-old resident of Canoga Park, has put more money in his bank 
account than any other player on the Professional Bowlers Assn. Senior Tour 
this year. He has earned $42,322, which was made possible only because he lost 
his job three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Boothe, a top amateur bowler in the Valley for several years, had been content 
working as a shop foreman for a company in Canoga Park that makes business 
signs. 
</P>
<P>
 On a whim in April, 1991, he bowled in two PBA Senior Tour events while on 
vacation. When Boothe returned to the shop, he was told by his boss at Karman, 
Ltd. that he and several other employees were being laid off. When the search 
for another job produced no prospects, Boothe returned to the tour -- if for no 
other reason than to avoid depression. 
</P>
<P>
 Boothe has not worked a day since. Now in his fourth year on the tour, he is 
earning more than the sport's top players, including several Hall of Famers 
from the regular PBA tour. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard to say," Boothe said when asked to explain the unlikely turn of 
events. "I feel very fortunate that I've done as well as I have. That's about 
the only way I can put it. . . . meant to be or not. I just feel very 
fortunate." 
</P>
<P>
 The youngest of 12 children raised on a Virginia farm, Boothe worked several 
different jobs until he entered the sign business in 1970 as a saw operator and 
moved his way up to supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
 While advancing his career, he bowled as many as five nights a week in 
industrial leagues. And when Boothe beat Rich Moores, 194-184, to win his first 
PBA Senior championship March 30 in the American Bowling Congress/PBA Senior 
Masters in Greenacres, Fla., many of his former shop mates -- who called Boothe 
by his middle name, Harmon -- were glued to their TV sets. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there's something happening on the senior's tour, we always look for 
Harmon's name," said Julius Papy, a top official at Karman, Ltd. "When he got 
into the finals everybody dashed home to watch it on ESPN. Everybody was very 
proud of him." 
</P>
<P>
 It was a poignant moment, especially for Papy, the man who terminated Boothe's 
job. 
</P>
<P>
 "Work sort of slowed down and my partner asked me to step in," Papy said. 
"Harmon was running production for me and I was overseeing him. There was 
nothing wrong with his abilities or technical knowledge or loyalty. 
</P>
<P>
 "I made a decision to get some supervisory people out of here and keep the 
people who had their hands on making the product." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Boothe: "I left under good circumstances with them. I knew it three or 
four months before it happened because they didn't have any work down there. I 
had to scrape around to try to find something to keep the guys busy so they 
wouldn't get let go earlier." 
</P>
<P>
 The parting might have been amicable, but Boothe -- unable to find another job 
in his field -- grew depressed. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was just devastated," said Boothe's wife, Mary. "It was unreal. I couldn't 
even explain it. I think he sort of felt like, 'What am I going to do now?' 
</P>
<P>
 "He had no retirement. He looked for a job maybe a year and a half. Nothing . 
. . nothing out there." 
</P>
<P>
 So Mary, who started her own insurance agency 11 years ago, decided to sponsor 
her husband and send him back out on tour. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is something he always wanted to do -- but he didn't think he'd ever get 
the chance," Mary said. "Now he's making his dream come true." 
</P>
<P>
 In three-plus years, Boothe has nearly $80,000 in career earnings, not 
including bonuses and perks from bowling-equipment companies. That might not 
seem like a fortune, but the PBA Senior Tour, which started in 1981, has never 
been a big-money sport. John Handegard, a former resident of Thousand Oaks, 
began 1994 as the all-time earnings leader with $218,282. That included eight 
championships. 
</P>
<P>
 Boothe entered at No. 39 in all-time earnings ($33,710), thanks to several 
high finishes, or "cashes." 
</P>
<P>
 But money is not what inspires many of the nearly 1,300 PBA Seniors and the 
estimated 800 who play at least one tournament each year. The idea that, once 
they've turned 50, they can compete against Hall of Famers such as Earl Anthony 
and Dick Weber is what lures them. 
</P>
<P>
 "You want to get out there and beat these guys every time you bowl," Boothe 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Boothe has at times out-bowled Weber and other Hall of Famers such as Don 
Johnson, Carmen Salvino and Dave Soutar, who have 86 victories on the regular 
tour among them. 
</P>
<P>
 These upstart seniors -- like Handegard, who worked in a saw mill, and rival 
Gene Stus, a former quality control supervisor for General Motors -- come from 
diverse backgrounds. Boothe's past is humbler than most. 
</P>
<P>
 He was born in a farmhouse in Pulaski, Va., the youngest of six daughters and 
six sons to Shelley and Stella Boothe. He was given the name Delano, although 
everyone called him "Hoboy." The origin of his nickname is uncertain, but, 
because he is asked so often, Boothe sticks to one explanation. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was little, my father wouldn't let me work in the fields so I used to 
carry the tools to my older brothers and sisters," he said. "I imagine my 
sister Clara saw me carrying hoses and water out to them, and she just happened 
to hit the name "Hoboy." 
</P>
<P>
 Boothe shortened it to Hobo when he moved to California in 1962. 
</P>
<P>
 The Boothes owned 200 acres on which they grew tobacco, corn, wheat and hay, 
and raised cows, horses and chickens. In 1956, one year after Hobo became the 
only child to graduate from high school, the Boothes sold their farm. 
</P>
<P>
 Hobo was 6 feet, 205 pounds and a fair athlete. A hard-throwing right-handed 
pitcher, Boothe couldn't play his junior year at Auburn High because of a heart 
murmur, but he had a good senior year. Boothe said he threw a good fastball and 
his most effective pitch -- which he called a "curve-drop" -- scared most 
batters. 
</P>
<P>
 "I could throw it right at a guy's head and it would curve over and sink down 
right at the plate," he said. "It was my best pitch." 
</P>
<P>
 Boothe might have gone on to pitch semipro ball, but a shoulder injury wrecked 
his arm at age 22. 
</P>
<P>
 "It got to hurting so much, why, I figured it wasn't worth it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the acclaim he never received in baseball has come to him in bowling. 
Since his $38,000 victory in March, television cameras and newspaper reporters 
have cornered him at every tour stop -- more out of curiosity about his name 
than anything else. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's not a household name yet," tour press secretary Dick Evans said. 'His 
name draws attention. People want to know where he got the name Hobo." 
</P>
<P>
 Evans, who covered bowling for four decades for the Miami Herald, said Boothe 
reminds him of Handegard, the tour's top player. 
</P>
<P>
 "The key to his success is he keeps himself in shape and practices," Evans 
said. "He's not a sensational bowler. He's a blue-collar worker. Hobo's a 
survivor -- and he seems to have a good time out here." 
</P>
<P>
 But Boothe did not have a good time in 1993, a year in which he barely cleared 
$9,000. He almost quit the tour despite spending the off-season changing his 
release and shortening his hook in hopes of improving his performance. Instead, 
he decided to play a limited schedule with the idea of retiring from pro 
bowling unless he could jump the ladder and increase his paychecks. 
</P>
<P>
 "I could throw the ball good, but I couldn't score last year," he said. "I was 
lacking something. I wasn't competitive enough. To me, you should be in the top 
15." 
</P>
<P>
 On the eve of his biggest performance, Boothe was still wavering. He was ready 
to cancel his travel plans to West Palm Beach, Fla. Had he done so, Boothe 
would have missed the victory that, Mary said, "probably gave him the biggest 
lift in his life." 
</P>
<P>
 With the Valley still experiencing strong aftershocks from the Northridge 
earthquake (in which the Boothes suffered $85,000 in damage and losses to their 
home), Boothe was concerned about his wife's safety. He told her he was 
skipping the Senior Masters tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 In a stern tone, Mary told him to start packing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Excuse me?" she said. "Oh, yes, you are going. You're going to bowl this 
tournament."

CITY TEAMS BEGIN TO HUDDLE UP; HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL: WITH TWO-A-DAYS BANNED, 
PRESEASON CONDITIONING IS OFF TO AN EARLY START. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Sure, it's early. Sure, it's hot. 
</P>
<P>
 But this is precisely the way most City Section football coaches wanted it. 
</P>
<P>
 Preseason conditioning for City football teams already is underway, believed 
to be the earliest that players and coaches have been permitted to meet in 
preparation for the fall high school season. The season begins Sept. 9. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of rule changes backed by the City's L.A. Football Coaches Assn., 
two-a-day practices have been eliminated, but coaches were permitted to meet 
with players for conditioning drills starting Monday. The City is providing 
busing for players who live outside the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Two-a-day practices were scrubbed because of their inherent advantage to 
schools on the traditional academic calendar. Players at year-round schools are 
in classes all morning. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have 13 schools on (the year-round calendar) and it wasn't really fair," 
City Commissioner Barbara Fiege said. "They can only practice once a day." 
</P>
<P>
 The conditioning period, during which teams also are permitted to walk through 
plays, ends Aug. 16. 
</P>
<P>
 From Aug. 17-19, players may practice while wearing helmets and shorts. On 
Aug. 22, practice in full pads begins. 
</P>
<P>
 Last summer, conditioning didn't begin until mid-August. 
</P>
<P>
 Predictably, there are trade-offs under the new schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 Reseda High players began conditioning Monday, while other schools are 
expected to begin at various times this week. It makes for a long season, to be 
sure. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's getting out of hand," said Reseda Coach Joel Schaeffer, who is entering 
his 16th season. "It takes away too much of the summer." 
</P>
<P>
 Conversely, Schaeffer said, the changes allow players to become gradually 
immersed in the sport, rather than be subjected to the two-a-day crash course. 
</P>
<P>
 Conditioning at Southern Section schools takes place August 22-24. Full 
practice begins August 25 with most openers set for Sept. 9. 
</P>
<P>
 At the behest of the football coaches association, the City also modified the 
playoff system. Instead of teams playing the season as members of the 3-A or 
4-A divisions, teams will be placed into the 3-A or 4-A playoffs based on 
won-loss records and perceived strength at the end of the season.

ALGERIAN SMASHES RECORD IN 3,000; TRACK AND FIELD: NOURREDINE MORCELI DROPS 
3.85 SECONDS FROM TWO-YEAR-OLD MARK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press

<TEXT>
<P>
 Algeria's Nourredine Morceli set his third world record Tuesday night, 
finishing the 3,000 meters in 7 minutes, 25.11 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 Morceli, who has shattered world records for the mile and the 1,500, topped by 
nearly four seconds the previous record in the 3,000, set in 1992 by Kenya's 
Moses Kiptanui. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've hungered for this since last year," said Morceli, who finished the 3,000 
last year at Monaco's Hercules Grand Prix in 7:29.24. "I had to compensate for 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 Kiptanui's time of 7:28.96 was set Aug. 16, 1992 in Cologne, Germany. Morceli 
beat that by 3.85 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 Behind Morceli Tuesday night were Haile Gebresilasie of Ethiopia (7:37.49), 
Abdellah Behar of France (7:39.29) and Jim Spivey of the United States 
(7:39.65). 
</P>
<P>
 Morceli, once a student at Riverside Junior College in California, holds world 
records in the mile (3:44.39) and the 1,500 (3:28.82). He was the 1,500 world 
champion in 1991 and 1993 and has dominated middle distance events. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the 1992 Olympics, Morceli finished seventh in the 1,500 when he was 
boxed in and was unable to get clear in the final lap. The gold medal went to 
Fermin Cacho of Spain. 
</P>
<P>
 In the pole vault, Kory Tarpenning, an American based in Paris, upset Sergei 
Bubka by clearing 19 feet, one-half inch.

ALGERIA'S MORCELI SMASHES 3,000 RECORD BY 3.85 SECONDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Nourredine Morceli of Algeria set his third world record Tuesday night, 
running the 3,000 meters in 7 minutes 25.11 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 Morceli, who broke world records for the mile and the 1,500, was nearly four 
seconds faster than the previous 3,000 record, set in 1992 by Moses Kiptanui of 
Kenya. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've hungered for this since last year," said Morceli, who finished the 3,000 
last year at Monaco's Hercules Grand Prix in 7:29.24. "I had to compensate for 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 Kiptanui's time of 7:28.96 was set Aug. 16, 1992 in Cologne, Germany. Morceli 
beat that by 3.85 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 Behind Morceli were Haile Gebresilasie of Ethiopia (7:37.49), Abdellah Behar 
of France (7:39.29) and Jim Spivey of Indiana (7:39.65). 
</P>
<P>
 Morceli, once a student at Riverside College, was the 1,500 world champion in 
1991 and 1993 and has dominated middle distance events. In the 1992 Olympics, 
Morceli finished seventh in the 1,500 when he was boxed in and was unable to 
get clear in the final lap.

DATELINE / ST. PETERSBURG; SPORTING PRESS HAS MADE A GAME OF RIPPING EVENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY HARVEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 No matter how many wrong turns they took in the maze of life within the 
Communist system, there was a time not so long ago when Russian VIPs could 
count on one thing. As long as they were VIPs, they would be handled with care 
by the country's media. 
</P>
<P>
 How Mayor Anatoly Sobchak, deputy mayor Vitali Mutko and other members of St. 
Petersburg's organizing committee for the Goodwill Games must long for those 
days. 
</P>
<P>
 While Goodwill Games President Jack Kelly of Atlanta has been pleading with 
the U.S. media to consider the difficulty of organizing an international 
multi-sport event in today's Russia and be kind, the local media has been 
whaling away. 
</P>
<P>
 They are agitated by the high cost of the Games to the taxpayers, paltry 
ticket sales, rampant commercialism, athletes who are accepting sizable 
appearance fees and performing at less than their best, petty thieves who are 
stealing the colorful Goodwill Games flags from the streets and even the 
residue of so many visitors in town. 
</P>
<P>
 In an article last week on the impact of the 17-day event upon residents, 
Valentina Vorobiova, a 56-year-old book binder, was quoted as saying: "I don't 
expect good coming out of the Games. I'm worried about our children, with those 
hordes of foreigners bringing along all sorts of venereal diseases. And 
terrorist attacks are also possible." 
</P>
<P>
 But most of the carping has been reserved for the organizing committee. The 
most popular adjective seems to be "bungling." 
</P>
<P>
 One newspaper, Komsomolskaya Pravda, editorialized last week that this edition 
of the Games has been such a fiasco that Ted Turner should call the whole thing 
off. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the third time in a row that the persevering American millionaire 
invests his dollars and takes losses," the newspaper said. "Maybe this time 
Jane Fonda's obstinate husband will do a sensible thing and stop it after Games 
No. 3." 
</P>
<P>
 Kristen Tobias, a young American who has lived in St. Petersburg for 1 1/2 
years, is in charge of translating Russian newspapers into English for the 
Turner Broadcasting System. That job, she says, has been depressing. 
</P>
<P>
 "The tone of most articles," she says, "seems to be, 'Despite all of the 
terrible problems in the Goodwill Games, there was one positive thing. . . .' 
Their attitudes are so different from the American media." 
</P>
<P>
 Dear, dear Tobias, either you have a short memory or you've been away from 
home too long. RANDY HARVEY

<TEXT>
<P>
 George Burnett, who coached Edmonton's top farm team the past two seasons, was 
hired Tuesday as the Oilers' coach. 
</P>
<P>
 He takes over for Glen Sather, who replaced the fired Ted Green last 
November.Sather is the team's president and general manager and will remain in 
those jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Edmonton finished at 25-45-14 last year and failed to make the playoffs. The 
Oilers were the NHL's fourth worst team. 
</P>
<P>
 Burnett coached the Cape Breton Oilers, Edmonton's American Hockey League 
affiliate, the last two seasons. He led the club to the league championship in 
1992-93. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an honor to become part of the select group of coaches that have led 
this team in its short but storied history," Burnett said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's now time to get to work. It's 32 days to the start of training camp and 
I look forward to the challenge."

MAMMOTH LURE; FOSSIL MAY BOOST TRAFFIC TO OFT-DESERTED ISLANDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 The discovery of a rare pygmy mammoth fossil on Santa Rosa Island could turn 
the spotlight on a national park that California has yet to discover. 
</P>
<P>
 Consistently one of the least visited parks in the state, the Channel Islands 
National Park will offer sightseers a chance to watch the excavation in 
progress next week, tour other archeological sites and, eventually, view a 
fiberglass model of the prehistoric creature. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fact that this is happening in our own back yard, I think it will focus 
attention on the islands and the unique resource that they are," said Carol 
Spears, spokeswoman for the park. "The islands are a treasure trove." 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, the five-island park off the Ventura County coast has yielded 
Chumash artifacts, prehistoric bones and remnants from 19th-Century shipwrecks. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest find may be the most significant. Paleontologists believe it to be 
the first discovery of a complete pygmy mammoth skeleton in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Like today's elephants, mammoths were strong swimmers. Scientists theorize 
that the pygmy mammoth's ancestors swam to the Channel Islands during the last 
Ice Age, when the crossing was much narrower. The ancestral elephant was a 
smaller version of the woolly mammoth that lived in southern California. On the 
island it evolved into a species that stood 4 to 6 feet high. 
</P>
<P>
 The smallest of the breed were about one-third the size of their mainland 
relatives. Some scientists believe there was more than one species of the 
mammoth on the islands. 
</P>
<P>
 San Diego geologist Tom Rockwell and his student Kevin Colson came across the 
fossilized remains on June 29 while studying fault lines on the rugged island. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew it was a mammoth at once," said Rockwell, who teaches at San Diego 
State University. 
</P>
<P>
 The skull, spine and hip of the animal literally stuck out in relief from the 
sand and ice plant on the eroding hillside, Rockwell said. Scientists believe 
they will find the tusks and legs beneath the surface. 
</P>
<P>
 The bones were too old to belong to a modern-day cow, he said. And the next 
largest animal on the Channel Islands was a small fox, which grew to about the 
size of a Yorkshire terrier. "(The find) was definitely not a fox," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 What he didn't know was that scientists had never found a full pygmy mammoth 
skeleton before. The full set of bones offers paleontologists a chance to 
determine more about the appearance of the animal and the species it evolved 
from. 
</P>
<P>
 An excavation team, drawn from universities across the nation, will arrive 
next week to unearth the rare fossil and preserve the bones for further study. 
The excavation is expected to take 10 days. 
</P>
<P>
 Two paleontologists, Larry Agenbroad and Jim Mead from Northern Arizona 
University, will focus on the fossilized bones, protecting each with resin and 
plaster casts. They will later evaluate them at their Arizona laboratory, Mead 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rockwell will join the team to evaluate the age of the rock sediment in which 
he found the fossil. He will collect coral and shell from the site for six 
months of analysis. 
</P>
<P>
 At first glance, he estimated the fossil was between 25,000 and 75,000 years 
old. Now he said he is leaning toward the 75,000- to 80,000-year range, judging 
from the sediment around the find. 
</P>
<P>
 The sea level on Santa Rosa Island dropped significantly about 70,000 years 
ago, leaving distinctive markings on the terrain, he said. Today, the fossil 
lies above a sea cliff that drops about 40 feet to the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
 Only about two or three scientists can work on the sloping site at one time, 
said Morris, the park archeologist. In addition, the crew plans to install a 
safety net beneath the dig so that no tools -- or scientists -- slip into the 
ocean below. 
</P>
<P>
 Next week, the park service is offering visitors a chance to watch the dig in 
progress. But space is limited, as much by the site as by the logistics of 
bringing visitors to the remote island. 
</P>
<P>
 Travel time and cost have always limited visitors to the Channel Islands, 
which became a national park 13 years ago. National Park Service figures last 
year showed that the islands received 55,000 visitors, fewer than any federal 
park in California except Devil's Postpile near Mammoth Lakes. 
</P>
<P>
 Spears said the trend has not changed this year, but hoped that publicity 
about the mammoth discovery, as well as shipwreck tours and nature walks, will 
lure more people to the islands. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can sponsor paleontological tours," she said. "We can show people where 
finds are discovered and how people discovered them." 
</P>
<P>
 And when the scientists finish their dig, they plan to use the bones to create 
a mold and cast a fiberglass replica of the pygmy mammoth, which would be 
placed in the park service's exhibit hall at Ventura Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
 The Friends of Channel Islands National Park are planning fund-raising events 
to provide the $20,000 needed to complete the model. FYI 
</P>
<P>
 Friends of Channel Islands National Park offers visitors a chance to see the 
excavation of a rare pygmy mammoth fossil. Visitors can take a 3 1/2-hour boat 
trip to Santa Rosa Island on Aug. 11, or a 25-minute airplane ride on Aug. 13. 
The boat trip will cost $55 to $70 and can be arranged by calling Island 
Packers at 642-1393. The plane trip, which will cost $85 to $100, can be 
arranged by calling 658-5740.

CUSTOMERS, OFFICIALS LAMENT PLANS FOR MERGER; HISTORY: TRADITION RUNS DEEP IN 
BANK OF A. LEVY, WHICH STARTED 112 YEARS AGO AND FINANCED MUCH OF THE COUNTY'S 
ORIGINAL GROWTH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY F. POLS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It began more than a century of business in what is now Port Hueneme, when a 
French immigrant with an eye toward a more profitable crop began offering loans 
to local farmers to encourage them to switch from barley to lima beans. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Bank of A. Levy, which financed much of the county's original growth, 
is the largest locally owned bank in Ventura County. Tradition runs deep: The 
bank's president is the great-grandson of that man who took a liking to lima 
beans. 
</P>
<P>
 But Bank of A. Levy's trademark green signs, emblazoned with founder Achille 
Levy's signature, will soon be replaced by the First Interstate logo. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday's announcement that the 112-year-old bank was being sold to corporate 
giant First Interstate Bancorp prompted strong expressions of regret from 
customers and local officials as they reminisced about the era when both the 
bank and the county were new. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were born with the city," Oxnard Mayor Manuel Lopez said. "And they 
helped the city develop." 
</P>
<P>
 "Things keep consolidating and getting bigger and bigger," he added. "I guess 
it follows a trend. We just lost the Oxnard Press-Courier. We're seeing an 
evolution of our agencies and businesses." 
</P>
<P>
 Customer Barbara Dick, a liquor store clerk from Oxnard who has banked with A. 
Levy for more than 40 years, said she was unhappy to hear that her friendly 
hometown bank had been sold to First Interstate, which has more than 1,000 
offices across the West. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't like that," Dick said. "So many times (when) you come to the Bank of 
A. Levy, they call you by name. I just hate to see the smaller businesses taken 
over by big corporations." 
</P>
<P>
 For some Ventura County residents, however, the sale was of little concern. 
"There seem to be a lot of changes at other banks and nothing's happened," said 
Lyle Johnson, emerging from the Bank of A. Levy branch in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 "As long as we get the same kind of service, it's OK with me," the retired 
telephone company supervisor said. 
</P>
<P>
 For others, the realization that the number of locally owned banks is 
dwindling -- rapidly being replaced with banks that cross state lines as nimbly 
as fast-food restaurants -- is just plain depressing. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is going to be an empty void in our community and in the hearts of many 
residents," said Don Facciano, Oxnard Chamber of Commerce executive director. 
"They have been not only a staunch supporter of the Chamber of Commerce, but 
also a staunch supporter of our whole community, particularly in the charitable 
field." 
</P>
<P>
 In the last four years, Bank of A. Levy's corporate and employee donations to 
United Way fund drives have averaged $75,000 each year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, the Bank of A. Levy has been an outstanding supporter," said 
Thomas Rummell, executive director of the Ventura United Way chapter. "I would 
hope that there would be continued support for our local community from First 
Interstate." 
</P>
<P>
 A charitable foundation established by the bank -- the Achille Levy foundation 
-- will close with it, said bank President Marshall Milligan, great-grandson of 
Achille Levy. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will pass on our responsibilities to the community to First Interstate," 
Milligan said. "They know it is good business for them to contribute to the 
community." 
</P>
<P>
 The bank's corporate headquarters on Vista Del Mar Drive in Ventura will 
probably be sold, Milligan said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I very much doubt that First Interstate will need it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The descendants of Achille Levy share mixed emotions about the sale, Milligan 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although part of the agreement with First Interstate includes a clause 
prohibiting him from working in banking in Ventura or Santa Barbara counties, 
he said he has no plans to move from the county, nor any to retire. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's way too early," he said. "I'm only 43."

FARMHAND SENTENCED FOR FRAUD; COURTS: OXNARD MAN SOUGHT WORKERS' COMPENSATION 
FOR INJURY, BUT AUTHORITIES SAID IT CAME IN ATTACK ON WIFE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DWAYNE BRAY, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 An Oxnard farm worker who broke a finger beating up his wife and later claimed 
the injury occurred on the job was sentenced Tuesday to 90 days in custody for 
workers' compensation fraud, a prosecutor said. 
</P>
<P>
 Prior to Tuesday's sentence, Miguel Gamez, 23, already had been convicted of 
spousal abuse for the attack on his wife, Deputy Dist. Atty. Rhonda Schmidt 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gamez is the second Ventura County defendant sentenced for defrauding the 
state workers' comp system since the district attorney made the crime a higher 
priority last year. 
</P>
<P>
 He claimed a work-related injury on March 31, 1993, saying he broke his right 
pinky finger while pulling some rope around a strawberry crate at work, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the doctor who examined Gamez noticed that the injury was not consistent 
with the defendant's story of how it occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 "The doctor who first examined him said, 'Hey, this wasn't an industrial 
injury. This was a boxer's fracture,' " Schmidt said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gamez was charged with two counts of workers' compensation fraud last 
February. He eventually pleaded guilty in June to one of the felony counts, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, Acting Superior Court Judge Bruce A. Clark reduced the conviction 
to a misdemeanor and ordered Gamez to serve his custody time in the county's 
work-furlough program. 
</P>
<P>
 The program allows inmates to go to work during the day while spending nights 
at a lockup at the Camarillo Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors had recommended a 180-day sentence for Gamez. 
</P>
<P>
 In handing down the sentence, however, Clark noted that Gamez is employed and 
has been performing satisfactorily on probation for the spousal abuse 
conviction, Schmidt said. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Public Defender William S. Markov, Gamez's lawyer, maintained Tuesday 
that his client suffered the work-related injury he reported. 
</P>
<P>
 Gamez decided to plead guilty because he did not want to suffer a felony 
conviction and did not want to miss work to attend a trial, his lawyer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Two weeks before he filed his false workers' comp claim, Gamez assaulted his 
wife, authorities said. He was charged with spousal abuse, but returned to work 
after being released from jail. 
</P>
<P>
 It was at that time that he went to a local doctor with a complaint of a hand 
injury, Schmidt said. That was when the doctor noticed the injury Gamez 
complained of was at least two weeks old and that it appeared to have been 
consistent with Gamez striking someone, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Markov said Gamez never specifically claimed to have injured his pinky finger 
at work. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mr. Gamez didn't say, 'I fractured my fifth metacarpal when I was working on 
the job.' He just said, 'I hurt my hand,' " Markov said. 
</P>
<P>
 Markov also said Gamez suffered a work-related injury prior to beating his 
wife. 
</P>
<P>
 The defendant can clearly recall that injury because his hand was so sore when 
he hit his wife that he couldn't close his fist, Markov said.

AVIARY IS REVITALIZED FOR BIRDS OF ALL FEATHERS; SANTA PAULA: COUNTY OFFICIALS 
ATTRIBUTE RESURGENCE OF THE STECKEL PARK SANCTUARY TO ITS NEW CARETAKER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 It is a decades-old sanctuary for unwanted birds, a wire mesh breeding ground 
of Australian love birds, Chinese geese and blue-crowned conures from South 
America. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Nestled in the oak woods north of Santa Paula, the Steckel Park aviary has for 
years been home to hundreds of exotic birds from across the globe as well as 
run-of-the-mill pigeons, quail and turkeys spared from Thanksgiving tables. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of them have been donated by people over the years," said John Eckert, 
34, who supervises the aviary in exchange for free rent in a nearby stone 
cottage just off California 150. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've had people bring in Mandarin ducks, parakeets, you name it," said 
Eckert, who scoops out 650 pounds of seed to the birds each month. "The other 
day I had a lady offer to donate a turtle. I'm thinking about it." 
</P>
<P>
 In the 10 months since Eckert moved his family into the 1930s-era home, signs 
of its glory years have been returning to the aviary, county park officials and 
bird lovers say. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a grand old lady that sort of fell by the wayside," said parks 
operations supervisor Pam Gallo. "We picked her up and gave her a new set of 
clothes." 
</P>
<P>
 Visitors stream onto the grounds at a brisk clip. On a typical summer day, 
Eckert sees 60 or 70 people, but on weekends hundreds of people will tour the 
aviary. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember it from a long time ago," said Don O'Toole, an electronics 
consultant from Kern County, who stopped by earlier this week. "I used to bring 
my children here in the 1950s." 
</P>
<P>
 On this visit, though, O'Toole said he missed some of the aviary's past 
attractions. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's not the same variety here there used to be," said O'Toole, who once 
lived in Thousand Oaks. "I haven't seen the raven or the variety of California 
birds they used to have here." 
</P>
<P>
 Eckert, a Ventura Regional Sanitation District worker who has managed the 
sanctuary since October, said there is a constant rotation of birds because 
some die, new ones hatch and others are sold. 
</P>
<P>
 "It just keeps evolving," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Things got pretty dire for the flighty critters in the 1980s, when Humane 
Society of Ventura County officials were routinely alerted to dirty cages, 
scarce water supplies and mice rummaging through bags of seed. 
</P>
<P>
 "It used to be in real bad shape," said Jolene Hoffman, humane society shelter 
director. "We'd get calls all the time." 
</P>
<P>
 But following a $25,000 renovation by California Conservation Corps members in 
1988, the bird population blossomed to more than 200 animals, and the calls to 
the humane society have dipped to a trickle. 
</P>
<P>
 "The complaints that have come in have not been serious," Hoffman said. "Just 
educational calls to try to correct a situation that could potentially have 
been harmful to the animals." 
</P>
<P>
 Viola Turner, a Ventura County Bird Club member who lives across Santa Paula 
Creek from the aviary, said Eckert needs more help in acquiring top-notch 
exotic birds. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there was more public support, there would be a bigger variety," Turner 
said. "But the aviary is very beneficial for people to learn about threatened 
or endangered species because we may never see them otherwise." 
</P>
<P>
 The aviary is stocked with dozens of different species -- from geese to ducks 
to peacocks and a variety of more exotic breeds such as cockatiels. 
</P>
<P>
 Eckert, his wife, Cathy, and their daughters, Candyce, 7, and Erin, 5, take 
turns feeding and watering the birds and cleaning the cages. The Eckerts pay 
for the feed -- about a dozen 50-pound bags a month -- in exchange for free 
rent. 
</P>
<P>
 On occasion, Eckert said, his girls bring one or two of the animals to class 
for show-and-tell. But sometimes, he said, caring for the birds gets serious. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last Thanksgiving Eve was a tough one," Eckert said. "There were four guys 
coming around after dark looking at the turkeys. So every few hours I was up, 
making sure they were OK. I thought they might cut the fence." 
</P>
<P>
 Fifteen-year-old Tom and his 3-year-old mate, Momma, were much relieved, 
Eckert said. But they still haven't been able to reproduce. 
</P>
<P>
 "They mate," Eckert said. "But they can't keep the eggs in here because Tom's 
so awkward he steps on them." 
</P>
<P>
 A week after Eckert moved into the stone house last fall, a wildfire swept 
through Steckel Park, burning thousands of acres and threatening the aviary. 
</P>
<P>
 "The birds got a little nervous," Eckert said. "I was standing here watching 
the fire burn down the hill, but it never crossed the road. The whole thing was 
a little eerie." FYI 
</P>
<P>
 The Steckel Park aviary is located inside Steckel Park, a 35-acre Ventura 
County park and picnic grounds about four miles north of downtown Santa Paula 
on California 150. 
</P>
<P>
 Its summer hours are from 7:30 a.m. to 8 p.m. daily, although on weekends and 
holidays, the park requests a $2 per-car entrance fee. Beginning in September, 
it will close at 7:30 p.m.

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; MERCHANTS TAKE UP WHEELCHAIRS IN 
ACCESS LESSON 
</P>

 When Thousand Oaks businessman Lance Winslow tried to negotiate a curb in his 
wheelchair Tuesday morning, he landed face down in the street. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's much harder than it looks," said Winslow, who confined himself briefly 
to a wheelchair to make a point. "I think people really have no idea what this 
is like." 
</P>
<P>
 Winslow and about a dozen other Thousand Oaks residents and business owners, 
most of whom are able-bodied, explored the world on wheels in an effort to 
smooth relations between businesses and those dependent on wheelchairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Winslow, who is also running for City Council, organized the morning event in 
response to complaints from members of the business community who object to 
requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act. 
</P>
<P>
 The day began with many business representatives expressing frustration over 
regulations that force them to make expensive improvements to provide access 
for the disabled, Winslow said. 
</P>
<P>
 What many business operators did not realize, said retirement home 
administrator Susan Morich, is that they can take a lot of small, inexpensive 
steps to improve access. 
</P>
<P>
 "What amazed me was how many little things there were that made the difference 
between us going in and us staying away," Morich said. "I think by doing (this 
experiment), we learned a lot." 
</P>
<P>
 Morich said simple improvements such as installing doors that open both in and 
out, and installing cuts in curbs make a world of difference. 
</P>
<P>
 The results can be beneficial to both the disabled and the businesses, Winslow 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "By writing off the handicapped, these businesses are writing off a whole 
population of potential customers," he said. "They're hurting themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 For 70-year-old Buzz Holzer, a Thousand Oaks resident who makes his way around 
town on an electric scooter, the day was a great success. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there is a lot the city and the businesses need to do in terms of 
creating accessibility," Holzer said. "The people we we're out with today 
really seemed to gain an understanding of the problem. They said, 'Boy, now I 
can see why you're upset.' " MATTHEW MOSK

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: NEWBURY PARK; ACTRESS CHARGED IN CHILD MOLESTATION 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Prosecutors on Tuesday charged an unemployed porn actress from Newbury Park 
with six criminal counts in connection with molesting a 14-year-old boy. 
</P>
<P>
 The boy told police that Laurie Ann Arden, 45, hired him to help her move and 
showed him nude images of herself before they had sex. 
</P>
<P>
 Arden is charged with two counts of unlawful sexual intercourse with a minor, 
two counts of sexual conduct using a foreign object, one count of showing 
explicit photos to a minor and another charge of lewd and lascivious conduct 
with a minor. 
</P>
<P>
 Arden's arraignment in Ventura County Municipal Court, scheduled for Tuesday, 
was postponed until Friday so her lawyer could review the police reports in the 
case. 
</P>
<P>
 Police confiscated several videotapes, disks and other computer equipment from 
a room Arden rented at the E-Z 8 Motel in Newbury Park. Currently unemployed, 
Arden has posed for sexually explicit films and magazines as recently as 
several months ago, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 She is the second woman in eastern Ventura County charged with having sex with 
a teen-age boy in recent months. Charges in the other case, against Gloria 
Goldman, 35, of Simi Valley, were dropped after a judge mistakenly refused to 
allow a witness to testify on Goldman's behalf during a preliminary hearing. 
The boy in that case has recanted and prosecutors have not refiled charges 
against Goldman. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Public Defender Neil B. Quinn, who represents both women, said it was 
rare for women to be charged with having sex with boys. But in light of the 
complaints against Goldman and Arden, he said he was not surprised that charges 
were filed in either case. DWAYNE BRAY

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; $640,000 ALLOCATED FOR FLOOD CONTROL

<P>
 Hoping to protect Simi Valley against flooding, the City Council has agreed to 
allocate nearly $640,000 to repair damaged sewer lines and flood control 
channels. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the damage occurred during the heavy rainstorms in February, 
1992.Parts of the Arroyo Simi, the city's main flood control channel, 
overflowed and walls of the flood channel collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
 The money will be spent to shore up the north bank of the Arroyo Simi west of 
Madera Road, repair a 12-inch sewer line, restore a water line and cover 
exposed pipes. 
</P>
<P>
 Some council members initially balked at the cost of the repairs and suggested 
they be postponed. 
</P>
<P>
 They relented after City Manager Lin Koester said the repairs are essential. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can't really go through a rainy season with those pipes exposed," Koester 
told the council. "The penalties are severe if one should break." SARA CATANIA

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: MOORPARK; COUNCIL TO CONSIDER CARLSBERG PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HADLY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Moorpark leaders will consider tonight whether to approve the largest proposed 
housing development in Moorpark. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council is also expected to decide whether to approve a negotiated 
settlement with the proposed developer, which would exempt Santa Monica-based 
Carlsberg Financial Corp. from future growth-control measures that could 
interfere with plans to build 550 homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman John Wozniak said he wanted to prevent the company from building on 
ridgelines and to push some of the proposed homes farther away from a rare 
wetland. Both moves would mean that the company would have to reduce the number 
of homes built at the site.  
</P>
<P>
 Wozniak also said he did not support the proposed settlement, which would 
exempt Carlsberg from Measure F, which restricts development. 
</P>
<P>
 "There has been some concern," Wozniak said, "about another lawsuit" from 
Carlsberg, which sued the city in 1991, alleging the city had unfairly limited 
the development to 405 homes. "But there is always a threat we'll get sued no 
matter what we do. I just see this exemption as flying in the face of what 
Measure F intended to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Others council members have said that the council is close to approving the 
Carlsberg development plans as well as the settlement agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't separate the two," said Mayor Paul Lawrason. "We've negotiated for 
years on this, and a lot of that time was under the threat of a lawsuit. But I 
think we are very close to finding a final compromise." 
</P>
<P>
 Lawrason said the city could receive about $3 million in fees from the 
developer if the project is approved. In addition, Carlsberg would have to 
complete needed improvements on Tierra Rejada and Spring roads. 
</P>
<P>
 "As far as I'm concerned, we're there in terms of reasonableness, equity and 
benefits to the city," Lawrason said. SCOTT HADLY

 Low-income homeowners in Moorpark may be eligible for grants and low-interest 
loans under a proposal to be considered by the Moorpark Redevelopment Agency 
tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 The program would offer grants of up to $5,000 and loans up to $10,000 for 
families of four with yearly incomes ranging from about $28,000 to $50,000.The 
money could be used to pay for everything from fixing a roof or painting the 
exterior walls to repairing interior plumbing, said Steven Hayes, economic 
development manager for the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "We still have to determine what the needs are and how many homes would 
qualify," Hayes said.  
</P>
<P>
 In an informal survey of the city, Hayes said his staff identified about 1,000 
homes in need of repairs, but a more detailed survey was required to determine 
the exact number of homes in disrepair. 
</P>
<P>
 State law mandates that 20% of the city's redevelopment funds be spent on 
low-income homeowners. The city has set aside about $2 million for low-income 
housing projects, with about$1.5 million now earmarked for a development at 
Gisler Field. The remaining money will be used for the home rehabilitation 
program, Hayes said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Redevelopment Agency will discuss the issue at 7 p.m. at Moorpark City 
Hall, 799 Moorpark Ave. SCOTT HADLY

 Three men pretending to be customers at the Cabrillo Cooperative Store in 
Ventura pulled out guns and a knife and robbed the store of more than $20,000 
in cash and merchandise Tuesday, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 After spending a few minutes browsing in the community store in Cabrillo 
Village on Saticoy Avenue, one of the men stepped behind the counter, pulled 
out a knife and grabbed the store's 24-year-old clerk, according to Ventura 
County sheriff's officials. 
</P>
<P>
 As he held the woman at knifepoint, two other men armed with guns raided a 
display case filled with what store officials said was more than $20,000 worth 
of watches and jewelry. 
</P>
<P>
 The three men then grabbed $600 in cash from the store's cash register and 
fled in a blue van, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 A sheriff's spokesman said the suspects were still at large late Tuesday.

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; MAN ARRAIGNED IN 1989 PARTY SLAYING

<P>
 A former Oxnard man arraigned on murder charges in connection with a 
5-year-old unsolved homicide pleaded not guilty in Ventura County Municipal 
Court on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Jose Villa, 28, was arrested about 11:30 p.m. Friday in Huntington Park after 
authorities received an anonymous tip that he was at his mother's house, 
Ventura County Deputy Dist. Atty.Donald C. Glynn said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police had been searching for Villa since June 18, 1989, when he interrupted a 
child's birthday party at Community Center Park in Oxnard and allegedly fatally 
shot Guillermo Ortega, who was in his 20s, Glynn said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ortega and Villa knew each other because Ortega's sister is married to Villa's 
uncle. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses to the killing had been uncooperative with police, making it 
difficult to track Villa down, Glynn said. 
</P>
<P>
 David F. Candelaria, Villa's attorney, said that his client had nothing to do 
with the Ortega slaying. "We're saying that he didn't kill him," said 
Candelaria, of Bakersfield. "It was somebody else." 
</P>
<P>
 A preliminary hearing to determine whether Villa should stand trial is set for 
Sept. 6, but Glynn said prosecutors will seek a murder indictment through the 
Ventura County grand jury prior to that date. DWAYNE BRAY

<P>
 An Oxnard woman pleaded not guilty on Tuesday to charges of child endangerment 
and battery, two days after witnesses reported she dropped her 3-month-old baby 
over a 6-foot-high chain-link fence. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses told police that Aretha Chester dangled the infant over the fence 
Sunday in Sierra Linda Park while chasing after the child's father, her 
boyfriend, who had jumped over the gate. 
</P>
<P>
 Municipal Judge Herbert Curtis III ordered the 23-year-old defendant held at 
the Ventura County Jail in lieu of $25,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
 As she waited in court to be led back to jail, Chester buried her face in her 
hands and sobbed. A preliminary hearing was set for Aug. 15. 
</P>
<P>
 Court officials said Chester has numerous past arrests and one conviction for 
battery, for which she is currently on probation. 
</P>
<P>
 Chester's lawyer, Deputy Public Defender Neil B. Quinn, said that her past 
brushes with the law, including the battery charge, are not connected with any 
mistreatment of her infant or any other child. DWAYNE BRAY

 The operator of an Ojai geophysical consulting firm was charged Tuesday with 
failure to file his tax returns, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard W. Van Derck, 48, was charged with willfully failing to file tax 
returns for 1985, 1986 and 1988, according to a statement issued Tuesday by the 
U.S. attorney's office in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Derck operated a consulting firm named Terranova and was aware of his 
responsibilities to file tax returns for his income from that business, 
according to the statement. 
</P>
<P>
 If convicted, Van Derck could face three years in prison and a $75,000 fine. 
Van Derck could not be reached for comment. MATTHEW MOSK

 Schools in those cities have year-round calendars and are beginning the new

<P>
 "I'm kinda scared," Miguel said in a voice barely above a whisper. "I don't 
know anybody. I'd rather still be playing." 
</P>
<P>
 Haley Ferguson, 12, a DeAnza seventh-grader, said she thinks it is unfair that 
she has to return to school when her next-door neighbor gets to sleep in. Her 
friend goes to Ventura High School, which remains on a traditional school 
calendar. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's home today, probably playing video games on his Sega, while I'm sitting 
here in school," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 While going back to school earlier than their friends still makes some 
students turn green, more are beginning to accept the concept of the modified 
calendar, educators said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our kids are used to going back to school in the middle of summer," said Dave 
Myers, principal at DeAnza, where a year-round calendar has been in effect for 
four years. "This is business as usual." 
</P>
<P>
 Lynn King, who teaches seventh-grade math at DeAnza, said children may not 
admit it, but some like coming back to school early. 
</P>
<P>
 "I ask them where they went on their vacation, and many of them say they 
didn't go anyplace," she said. "They're glad to be back with their friends and 
doing things." 
</P>
<P>
 Five elementary schools and DeAnza are the only campuses in the Ventura 
Unified School District that follow the modified calendar. But all grade levels 
in the Fillmore Unified School District are on year-round schedules. 
</P>
<P>
 And Oxnard Elementary school district has been scheduling classes on the 
year-round calendar for nearly two decades. 
</P>
<P>
 But some still feel a twinge of envy when they see other youth cramming video 
arcades and malls while they're stuck in a warm classroom. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't get to see our friends in high school as much," said Denise Vasquez, 
13, a seventh-grader at DeAnza. 
</P>
<P>
 And there are scheduling problems for families. One of Denise's brothers is in 
college and another is in high school, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "My parents have trouble getting rides for all of us," she said. "We're all on 
different schedules." KAY SAILLANT

FIRM'S RELOCATION TO COST UP TO 400 JOBS 
</P>

 An Oxnard maker of blood pressure monitoring devices will close its doors and 
move to Singapore within five months, leaving most of its 400 employees without 
a job. 
</P>
<P>
 Ohmeda Medical Devices, a New Jersey-based company, has announced that it is 
consolidating its operations worldwide to save money.It has facilities in 30 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
 The company plans to close its Oxnard facility and purchase new high-tech 
manufacturing equipment for its plant in Singapore, where the monitoring 
devices are already being made for less than the cost of the U.S. models. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to cost-cutting, a patent dispute with the Baxter Co. threatened 
Ohmeda's production of the devices in the United States, according to a news 
release. The Oxnard plant has been in operation since 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 Steven Kinney, executive director of the Greater Oxnard Economic Development 
Corp., said he was disappointed and surprised by the news. But the move was 
prompted by circumstances that had nothing to do with Oxnard and its business 
climate, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they decide they can make more money by going to Singapore, that's what 
they're going to do," Kinney said. 
</P>
<P>
 A few of the Oxnard managers will be transferred to other company facilities, 
but most of the 400 employees will be laid off beginning in September, said 
spokeswoman Judee Shuler. Most of the workers held low-paying assembly-line 
type jobs.  
</P>
<P>
 Displaced employees will receive between four to 26 weeks of severance pay, 
depending on experience, Shuler said. MIGUEL BUSTILLO

GRADING MAY START ON OUTLET MALL AFTER LAWSUIT IS SETTLED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Grading work on the long-awaited Camarillo factory outlet project may start as 
early as this week following an out-of-court settlement between the mall's 
developer and an Oxnard business park owner, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The mall's developer, Chelsea GCA Realty of Newport Beach, has agreed to pay 
Stephen Maulhardt $150,000 to drop a lawsuit -- his second against the project 
in two years. The suits charged that the city had not required an adequate 
environmental review and that the project's traffic plan was faulty. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of the settlement, Maulhardt, along with co-plaintiff and Camarillo 
resident Richard Lundberg, agreed to drop all actions against the project. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Maulhardt nor representatives of Chelsea GCA could be reached for 
comment Tuesday, but Camarillo City Manager Bill Little said the city is 
relieved that the legal conflict is over. 
</P>
<P>
 "This agreement allows the developer to get the project back on line," Little 
said. "And the sooner he does that, the sooner we will start seeing sales tax 
revenues come to the city." 
</P>
<P>
 Little said the factory outlet mall -- the county's second behind the one 
recently opened in Oxnard -- will generate an estimated $350,000 to $400,000 
annually for the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The settlement also allows the city to seek to overturn a 1993 Superior Court 
ruling that invalidated an agreement between the city and Chelsea. The court 
ruled that the deal, which rebated part of the mall's sales taxes to Chelsea, 
amounted to a gift of public funds. 
</P>
<P>
 The tax rebate sparked Maulhardt's first lawsuit in October, 1992. Little said 
that if the city is successful in overturning the ruling, officials could then 
strike a similar deal with Chelsea and do the same with other developers. 
</P>
<P>
 The 21-acre site is south of Ventura Boulevard between Carmen Drive and Las 
Posas Road. Edwards Theaters is already building a 12-screen cinema adjacent to 
it. J. E. MITCHELL

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; CITY AWARDS GRANTS FOR ARTS PROGRAMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Grants totaling more than $130,000 to pay for a wide range of artistic 
programs were awarded to 35 individuals and groups in Ventura on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's office of cultural affairs awarded the annual grants, which range 
from $500 to $5,000 and are designed to support artists for the creation of new 
work. 
</P>
<P>
 A portion of the funding went to individuals for projects such as murals, 
orchestral compositions, slide productions and poetry readings. The city also 
awarded grants for larger organizational projects, including several dance and 
theater productions. 
</P>
<P>
 "The goal is to provide direct resources to nonprofit groups and artists to 
create an environment in the city where the arts can thrive and grow," said 
Sonja Tower, the office's cultural affairs supervisor.  
</P>
<P>
 The funding for these grants comes from the city's general fund, Tower said. 
</P>
<P>
 The largest grants, of $5,000, were awarded to Ventura County Master Chorale 
for five concerts in downtown Ventura; Ventura College Community Services, to 
present a concert series focusing on cultural diversity; Inlakech Teatro 
Theatre Company for production of the third annual Dia de los Muertos cultural 
celebration in Ventura, and to Hiroko Yoshimoto for the production of an 
exhibition featuring a multi-generational theme. MATTHEW MOSK

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: PORT HUENEME; FEE FOR EXTRA TRASH PICKUP TO BE 
WEIGHED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRISTINA LIMA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a move to cut down on garbage and promote recycling in Port Hueneme, the 
city is considering charging residents $10 per month to pick up extra trash 
bags and increasing the number of recycling locations in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The measure, which is scheduled to be considered by the City Council tonight, 
would increase the fee for residents who need more than one trash bin by $10, 
replacing extra bags with a 60-gallon refuse container, said Douglas A. Breeze, 
manager for the public works department. 
</P>
<P>
 The containers allow workers to use automated arms on refuse trucks to pick up 
the trash, rather than forcing workers to pick up the bags manually. It costs 
the city about $300 a week in labor costs to pick up trash bags, Breeze said. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the plan, one worker no longer needed to pick up bags would be 
transferred to the recycling department. 
</P>
<P>
 The city, which is required by the state to reduce trash by 25% in 1995, has 
only five stations where residents can deposit their recyclable goods, Breeze 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Plans to increase recycling in Port Hueneme include setting up stations at 
Surfside I and Surfside III, Seaview Apartments, Anacapa View Condominiums and 
Scott Street, Breeze said. 
</P>
<P>
 If the council approves the measure, Breeze said, it will become effective 
Oct. 31. CHRISTINA LIMA

ROLLBACK OF CABLE HOURLY FEES ORDERED; THOUSAND OAKS: TWO SYSTEMS ARE ORDERED 
TO REFUND RATE DIFFERENCES FOR INSTALLATION AND SERVICE. BUT COMPANIES DENY 
OVERCHARGING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks' two cable companies must roll back their hourly service charges 
and send refunds to every customer who paid inflated fees for cable 
installation or repair, council members ordered Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County Cablevision, which serves 31,540 Thousand Oaks households, must 
slash its hourly service rate nearly in half, from $40.80 to $20.70. Falcon 
Cablevision must also make deep cuts, reducing its hourly service fee from $65 
to just under $40. 
</P>
<P>
 And both companies must refund the difference to subscribers who were charged 
the higher service rates. 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives from both cable companies said they would probably appeal to 
the Federal Communications Commission, which has final say over cable 
television rulings by local jurisdictions. 
</P>
<P>
 Although VCC's service charge may have exceeded federal guidelines, the 
company has been undercharging for basic subscriptions, spokesman Johnnie Giles 
said. "We have provided reasonable rates," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Representing Falcon, analyst Sherry Brennan said her company charges are 
justified. If forced to slash rates, she said, Falcon might have to begin 
charging customers for many services now provided free. 
</P>
<P>
 But several council members said the refund order was both necessary and fair. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of our population is on fixed income, senior citizens, and they're 
really being hurt" by the high service fees, Councilman Frank Schillo said. 
"Service fees eat up a lot of money." 
</P>
<P>
 Because Thousand Oaks is hilly and hemmed in by mountains, many residents 
cannot tune in television broadcasts clearly unless they subscribe to cable. 
And the city's dependency on cable makes rate regulation especially important, 
Schillo said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're a captive audience here," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with ordering the refunds, council members on Tuesday asked the federal 
government to investigate Falcon's subscription rates, which affect nearly 
5,000 customers in northwestern Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 In particular, city officials questioned Falcon's decision to remove WTBS from 
its basic tier and strip three other channels -- TNT, Discovery and Prime 
Ticket -- from its popular upgrade tier, known as the Cable Network Package. 
Subscribers must pay an extra $3.95 a month to receive those four channels "a 
la carte." 
</P>
<P>
 "We now wonder whether their a la carte system . . . (indicates they are) 
trying to avoid rate regulation for some of their popular channels," said 
Caroline Milton, the city's media services coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday's council action orders the companies to prepare a refund plan within 
15 days, detailing how customers will be reimbursed -- with interest -- for the 
inflated service charges. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said they have no idea how many households will receive refund 
checks. But in general, all customers who ordered service between Sept. 1, 1993 
and July 14, 1994 will be eligible for a refund. 
</P>
<P>
 The refund period ends in mid-July, because the Federal Communications 
Commission revised its price benchmarks as of this summer to force cable 
companies to lower their rates still further. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks can audit both VCC and Falcon's rates later this year to make 
sure they comply with the new federal standards. 
</P>
<P>
 The city regained the power to regulate subscription rates, add-on fees and 
service charges after Congress passed cable reform laws in 1992 following a 
decade of customer complaints about too little government regulation.

PARENTS OF SLAIN STUDENT FILE NEGLIGENCE CLAIM AGAINST SCHOOL DISTRICT; SIMI 
VALLEY: THE COUPLE ALLEGE THAT OFFICIALS KNEW OF THREATS BUT FAILED TO PROTECT 
THEIR SON FROM A SCHOOLMATE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MACK REED, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The parents of slain student Chad Hubbard have filed a $2-million 
wrongful-death claim, alleging that the Simi Valley Unified School District and 
employees negligently let a classmate stab their son to death last winter. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott and Jackie Hubbard allege that the district failed to protect their 
14-year-old son from schoolmate Phillip Hernandez, who killed him in a fight in 
February at Valley View Junior High School. 
</P>
<P>
 Chad Hubbard, a ninth-grader and member of the school's baseball team, had a 
running feud with Hernandez for several weeks before his death, witnesses 
testified at Hernandez's trial. 
</P>
<P>
 On the afternoon of Feb. 1, witnesses testified, Chad hounded Hernandez as he 
walked to his bus stop after classes. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys on both sides agreed at trial that Chad had insisted on fighting and 
finally punched Hernandez at least once before Hernandez stabbed him once in 
the chest. 
</P>
<P>
 Hernandez, 14, was sentenced last week to four years in a California Youth 
Authority prison for involuntary manslaughter. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just feel the reason my son is gone is because of their negligence," Scott 
Hubbard said Tuesday. The district knew of the conflict between the two boys, 
but never told the Hubbards, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel if they would have let us know about the problem with Chad and 
Phillip, we could have talked to Chad and the problem could have been solved," 
he said. "Chad listened to us. . . . They never, ever, ever called us." 
</P>
<P>
 The claim filed against the school district and co-defendant Ventura County 
last month alleges that Valley View staff knew or should have known that 
Hernandez had a knife and that he had threatened to kill Chad. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hubbards are seeking at least $1 million in damages from the district and 
$1 million more from Ventura County, since that is where the district is 
located, the Hubbards' lawyer said. The parents' claim is meant to cover 
funeral costs and the loss of the boy's love and companionship to his family. 
</P>
<P>
 The claim charges that the district: 
</P>
<P>
 * Did not have adequate weapons detectors or security personnel at Valley 
View; 
</P>
<P>
 * Failed to warn the Hubbards about threats against their son; 
</P>
<P>
 * Failed to protect Chad Hubbard from violence despite knowing about the 
alleged threats. 
</P>
<P>
 It also alleges that unnamed Valley View employees failed to stop Hernandez's 
attack, failed to call paramedics immediately and negligently cared for Chad 
after he was stabbed. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hubbards' claim against the district, like other such actions, is legally 
required before they can file a lawsuit in Ventura County Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
 School district officials are recommending that the district's board refuse to 
pay the claim, said Assistant Supt. E. Leon Mattingley. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's our policy not to comment on pending litigation, but we are putting it 
on the governing board's agenda for Aug. 16," Mattingley said Tuesday. "And 
we're recommending, along with our claims adjuster and . . . our liability 
insurance carrier, that we reject it." 
</P>
<P>
 The Hubbards' claim does not make specific allegations against Ventura County. 
But Leighanne Lake, one of two Santa Monica attorneys representing the 
Hubbards, said the county was included in the suit only because the school 
district is located there. 
</P>
<P>
 Jacalyn Cohen, the county's manager of liability actions, said officials are 
still evaluating the claim. "But as a simplistic point we don't have anything 
to do with the school district," she said. "So we anticipate we will reject 
it."

 Piper Investors Sue KPMG Peat Marwick: The plaintiffs say they lost money 
investing with Piper Jaffray Cos. and that the auditing firm was negligent in 
examining the books of one of the Minneapolis-based brokerage's money-losing 
mutual funds. The Institutional Government Income Portfolio lost about a 
quarter of its value beginning in February as interest rates rose and the value 
of its mortgage-backed derivatives fell.The investors thought they were buying 
a "safe, stable, secure" fund when in fact its derivatives holdings were not 
safe at all, according to a plaintiff's attorney. The suit alleges that if Peat 
Marwick had done its job properly, the management of Piper would have 
recognized the risks investors were running and the losses would have been 
less.

HUBERS LAY LOVED ONE TO REST; FUNERAL: THREE YEARS AFTER HER SLAYING, THE O.C. 
WOMAN IS BURIED IN SOUTH DAKOTA WITH TEARS AND HAPPY MEMORIES.

 When Dennis Huber saw his daughter's steel, white casket for the first time, 
the pain and anguish of the past three years came crashing down on him. 
</P>
<P>
 "The reality of it all was like having a double-barrel shotgun pointed right 
at my face," an emotional Huber said Tuesday as final preparations were being 
made for his daughter's funeral and burial Tuesday in this rural, Midwest 
farming community. "It was really rough." 
</P>
<P>
 In this town, where the Huber family has deep roots, more than 225 friends and 
relatives crowded into the tiny First Reformed Church to take part in a somber, 
90-minute ceremony commemorating the life of murder victim Denise Huber. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone around here was touched by what happened to her," said Clarence O. 
Fjeldheim, a local farmer and mayor of Herreid, a community of 485 residents. 
"This is a small town and people are very close." 
</P>
<P>
 Tears flowed throughout the church while friends and relatives gave moving 
tributes to the 23-year-old Newport Beach woman, who was remembered for her 
gregarious personality, zest for life, passion for water skiing and traveling, 
fondness for dogs and frogs, and her religious faith. 
</P>
<P>
 Some mourners had to sit in the church basement, watching the service on a 
video monitor; others gathered outside under cloudy skies around another 
monitor set up near a large cottonwood tree. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, in the dense humidity and 80-degree heat, Denise Huber was buried next 
to her grandfather, Edward Huber, who farmed the flat, green prairies in this 
region and opened the city's first motel. She was especially close to him in 
life, family members said, as she will be in death. 
</P>
<P>
 "She thought so much of him and he thought so much of her, and now we believe 
they are in heaven together," Dennis Huber said. 
</P>
<P>
 He explained the burial spot simply: Denise "always enjoyed" visiting Herreid. 
"We really feel like we're home and among friends and family and that is very, 
very important to me," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He and his wife, Ione, are moving late in August from Newport Beach to 
Bismarck, N.D., about 100 miles north of Herreid. They had planned the move 
before their daughter's body was found bludgeoned, handcuffed and stuffed in a 
freezer in Arizona three weeks ago. She was reported missing June 3, 1991, her 
abandoned car found with a flat tire on the Corona del Mar Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 "I look at it as a new start and hopefully we can get away from some of the 
bad memories," Dennis Huber said of the move out of Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a lot of support here and that will be good in the healing process," 
Ione Huber added. "We can leave with some resolve now." 
</P>
<P>
 The folks here have followed the case ever since Denise Huber disappeared. At 
the time, Herreid residents were shocked. But when they learned of how her body 
was found, they were horrified. Some talk about seeing the case reported on 
national television news shows. Others still collect newspaper articles about 
the case. 
</P>
<P>
 No one here was surprised at the turnout for the funeral. More would have 
come, they said, but they wanted to save seats for the Huber's large family, 
many of whom live here and others who journeyed from around the nation. It was 
a closed-casket service because of the condition of the body, which the family 
never viewed. 
</P>
<P>
 In many ways, the service was similar to a memorial held in Newport Beach July 
23: with the family's pastor, the Rev. Walt Shepard, again leading the service, 
relatives giving eulogies and the congregation singing hymns. 
</P>
<P>
 A large collage of photographs of Denise from toddler to adult, which was 
displayed in Newport Beach, was propped on an easel outside the brown 
wood-framed church. People stopped and gazed at the pictures showing her with 
family and school friends. 
</P>
<P>
 Another large photograph of Denise as a smiling, young adult was at the front 
of the church, leaning against the casket. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were so many things that made Denise special. Her laughs, her smiles 
and sense of humor." said cousin Carrie Vandenburg, 24, of Seattle. "But I 
think the thing I loved most about Denise was she knew what was important to 
her." 
</P>
<P>
 Standing behind the casket adorned with several arrangements of red and white 
carnations, she spoke of her admiration for Denise's ability "to have fun" and 
her love of travel. 
</P>
<P>
 " . . . You couldn't help but love her. That's why this doesn't make any 
sense," she said. "I miss her terribly." 
</P>
<P>
 Another cousin, Rod Vandenburg, of Palm Springs described Denise as living 
"every day to the fullest. She always made me feel right at home with her." He 
talked about his daughter, who was born on the day Denise disappeared, and 
declared: "God gave us a true remembrance (of Denise). I'm sad that Denise is 
not with us anymore, but we have peace in knowing that she is in the hands of 
the Lord." 
</P>
<P>
 Costa Mesa Police Chief David L. Snowden delivered a moving tribute, bringing 
himself and many others to tears as he described how his officers treated 
Denise's disappearance as if it had happened to their own daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I took the oath of police officer I really didn't know what to expect," 
said Snowden. "I expected the action, I expected to be beaten up and shot at, I 
expected people to throw things and call me names for writing tickets. But 
nobody ever prepared me for the hurt." 
</P>
<P>
 He spoke of having visited the grave of Sitting Bull in nearby Mobridge the 
previous evening, and how it caused him to reflect on life in California and 
South Dakota, as well as his profession. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes I wonder why police officers die so young and retire so young, and 
I think a lot of it has to do with the fact that a piece of their heart breaks 
every time a young person dies," Snowden said, his voice cracking with emotion. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't know three years ago that of all the travels that Denise has done, 
the longest travel she would have would be from the arms of her parents to 
here," he concluded. "I pray for Denise and I pray for her family and I pray to 
God this never happens to anybody again." 
</P>
<P>
 At a brief graveside ceremony, family members released multicolored balloons, 
watching them soar into the cloudy South Dakota sky. 
</P>
<P>
 After the burial, the Hubers invited friends and family for a potluck luncheon 
at the Herreid Community Center, which also doubles as the Skateland roller 
rink. 
</P>
<P>
 There, the parents spoke briefly to reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 They said they cherished the community support and are relying heavily on 
their religious faith. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a process that is probably just beginning and we are going to have a 
lot more to deal with in the future," Ione Huber said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hubers said they plan to attend the trial in Orange County of John J. 
Famalaro, who is accused of Denise's kidnaping and murder, and hope he gets the 
death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think I could ever begin to figure out why" Denise was killed, Dennis 
Huber said. "She was a beautiful, wonderful person who deserved to be on this 
world, but I guess God wanted her up in heaven more then He wanted her here." 
</P>
<P>
 Ione Huber agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't find words to describe her," she said. "She was just a beautiful 
person and she should not have had to leave us the way she did." 
</P>
<P>
 Denise's brother Jeff Huber expressed his anger. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd love to confront (Famalaro) with my bare hands. And you can put that in 
quotes," said the 24-year-old Costa Mesa country-Western singer. 
</P>
<P>
 He said his sister's death "makes you appreciate your loved ones when you've 
got them. It makes you realize just how temporary life is."

INVESTIGATORS BACK WITH LOAD OF EVIDENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Investigators in the Denise Huber murder case Tuesday unloaded a rental truck 
packed with evidence and embarked on the painstaking process of examining 
"every shred" of suspect John J. Famalaro's personal effects seized from the 
Arizona home where Huber's body was found in a freezer. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other things, investigators hope to determine whether the 37-year-old 
house painter had ever met the 23-year-old waitress before she was abducted 
from the side of the Corona del Mar Freeway on June 3, 1991. Authorities also 
are seeking evidence that would confirm that Famalaro, a former Lake Forest 
resident, was in the Orange County area at the time Huber vanished. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're pretty confident that he was in the Orange County area during the 2nd 
and 3rd of June (in 1991), which is when she disappeared," said Costa Mesa 
police Lt. Ron Smith. 
</P>
<P>
 "But we're looking for any kind of receipt, phone bill, letter, canceled 
check, anything that would give us a time and a date and a location, and 
anything that would somehow connect him with Denise before the disappearance 
that would explain their encounter," Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Is it just chance that her tire goes flat and he happens to be driving by? Or 
had he been following her?" 
</P>
<P>
 Huber's friends and family, and some police investigators have speculated that 
the former UC Irvine student may have known her assailant, or mistaken him for 
a law enforcement officer. Bogus Los Angeles County sheriff's deputy shirts 
were found during a search of Famalaro's home in Arizona, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Famalaro is being held without bail in the Yavapai County, Ariz., Jail pending 
his extradition to Orange County. Arrested July 13 after Huber's body was 
discovered inside a freezer inside a stolen rental truck at his Arizona house, 
Famalaro faces first-degree murder charges in connection with the kidnaping and 
slaying of the Newport Beach woman. He could be eligible for the death penalty 
if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County prosecutors also filed murder charges against Famalaro last week 
after preliminary DNA testing indicated bloodstains at a Laguna Hills warehouse 
facility rented by Famalaro matched Huber's blood. 
</P>
<P>
 Famalaro has not yet entered a plea to the latter charges, but he has pleaded 
not guilty to the Arizona charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Using a rental truck of their own, police detectives over the weekend packed 
up reams of evidence taken from Famalaro's home and drove to Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 While Huber was buried next to her grandfather in South Dakota Tuesday, police 
here peeled open the truck and began sorting through evidence, much of which 
they already looked through once in Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other items, the 17-foot truck was filled with hundreds of boxes of 
documents, papers and personal effects. Police also unloaded the suspected 
murder weapon -- a nail-puller that was previously described as a crowbar -- 
the freezer in which Huber's body was found, Huber's clothes and other 
belongings, as well as a refrigerator found inside Famalaro's house. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities predicted it would take weeks to pore through it all. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're looking through every shred of paper to see if there's any significance 
to it at all," Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the refrigerator, Smith said detectives are looking for clues that would 
indicate whether Huber's body was stored there while Famalaro awaited delivery 
of a freezer he had ordered from an Orange County Montgomery Wards store 
shortly after Huber's disappearance. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's about a nine-day gap," Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Assistant Dist. Atty. John Conley said Tuesday the extradition 
process is underway, but that it could take weeks before completion. "The 
paperwork's being prepared for the governor's office," Conley said. 
</P>
<P>
 Famalaro's lawyers said they haven't decided whether to fight extradition. A 
hearing on the matter is scheduled to take place in Arizona on Aug. 29. 
</P>
<P>
 Conley said prosecutors have not yet decided whether to take the case to the 
Orange County Grand Jury for a possible indictment, which would speed up 
matters. 
</P>
<P>
 Conley acknowledged that culling the evidence could take some time. 
</P>
<P>
 "The image we have of him (Famalaro) is that he was a pack rat. He kept 
everything," Conley said. "It's a tedious process." 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Public Defender Leonard Gumlia said Tuesday his office is gearing up 
for the Famalaro case and is prepared to begin poring over the evidence and 
volumes of documents in the case as soon as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a lot there," Gumlia said. "It could take weeks, more likely 
months." 
</P>
<P>
 Gumlia said it is too soon to begin discussing defense strategies but said he 
anticipates asking to move the trial from Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will be looking at a change-of-venue motion in this case," Gumlia said. 
"It's gotten to the point where (Denise Huber) is referred to in headlines as 
'Denise.' It's in all the papers. It's everywhere." 
</P>
<P>
 Gumlia said he is concerned that the media storm surrounding the story could 
unfairly sway potential jurors. He said he would also be concerned if 
prosecutors seek a grand jury indictment against Famalaro, because it is 
possible that grand jurors have also been following the case in the media.

PROBLEMS UNDERCUT DEBUT OF CLAS TESTS, PANEL SAYS; EDUCATION: EXPERTS SAY 
OUTSIDE FIRM SHOULD ADMINISTER THE EXAMS. BUT THEY PRAISE THE PROGRAM FOR 
INNOVATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Budget constraints, scoring glitches and the difficulties inherent in such a 
complex new testing system have undercut the pioneering California Learning 
Assessment System exams, a panel reviewing the CLAS tests' first rocky year has 
concluded. 
</P>
<P>
 Most individual school results for the 1993 exams were less reliable than 
promised, and some 250 schools statewide received scores that may be woefully 
inaccurate because of severe processing problems, the panel found in its 
62-page report, to be released today. 
</P>
<P>
 The three-member panel of statistical experts recommended that the state 
Department of Education hire an outside firm to administer the tests. The group 
also called for the department to turn over responsibility for scoring and 
interpretation of the results to a statistics expert and to hire a full-time 
technical coordinator to oversee the effort. 
</P>
<P>
 The panel also cautioned against releasing individual student scores, 
scheduled to begin this year, until the bugs are worked out and parents and 
teachers are thoroughly briefed on how to interpret the results. The governor's 
office has been pushing for individual results so parents and teachers can 
gauge students' progress. 
</P>
<P>
 The exams, intended to pinpoint a school's academic strengths and weaknesses 
by assessing how well students can think and write about what they have 
learned, were given for the first time last year to about 1 million public 
school students in fourth, eighth and 10th grades. To save money, the 
department decided to score only some of the exams in reading, writing and 
mathematics before releasing results for each school. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost immediately, questions surfaced about the accuracy of the scores, which 
were widely published and used by parents and others to evaluate schools. A 
Times computer analysis published in April showed that thousands of schools 
received shaky results, and that at least 150 schools had statistically invalid 
samples of student scores. 
</P>
<P>
 At one San Bernardino County middle school, for example, only 1% of the math 
tests were ever counted. Two schools -- Vicentia Elementary in Corona and 
Columbia Elementary in Tuolumne County -- received results based on exactly one 
student's work. Dozens of others across the state had only a handful of tests 
scored though scores, or even hundreds, of students participated in the exam. 
</P>
<P>
 The panel of three statistical experts, appointed by the department in April 
to review its scoring procedures, found that there were serious shortfalls in 
the numbers of 1993 exams graded in about 250, or 3%, of schools. In those 
cases, additional exams were scored and results adjusted, the Department of 
Education said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the experts, headed by Lee J. Cronbach of Stanford University, concluded 
that "few school-level reports in 1993 had adequate reliability." 
</P>
<P>
 Problems inherent in the sampling procedures were compounded by lost test 
booklets, errors matching student identification sheets to the booklets, 
mistakes by the contractors helping administer and score the tests, and the 
rush to get scoring done and results released before the 1994 round of testing 
began in the spring. 
</P>
<P>
 "Inadequate review under time pressure led to the release of some reports that 
were manifestly untrustworthy," Cronbach added. 
</P>
<P>
 To make matters worse, many parents and school staffs had expected all the 
tests to be graded, the report noted. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the panel was assigned to look primarily at the sampling procedures, 
it also noted difficulties in scoring the open-ended, or "performance-based" 
questions that are the hallmark of CLAS and other pioneering testing systems 
around the country. Instead of merely selecting the correct answer from a list 
of possibilities, students are being asked to solve math problems and explain 
their methods or read a passage from literature and write about their 
responses. 
</P>
<P>
 But the panel commended CLAS officials for some of their work. 
</P>
<P>
 "CLAS and its contractors have embarked on an unprecedented and imaginative 
project . . . and they have done many things well," Cronbach wrote, adding the 
1993 efforts were "highly successful as a trial" and shed valuable light on 
many aspects of the just-emerging field of performance-based assessment. 
</P>
<P>
 "All the shortcomings of CLAS 1993 can be remedied," Cronbach added. 
</P>
<P>
 Acting state Supt. of Public Instruction William D. Dawson said he welcomed 
the report and has already acted on some of its recommendations. Scoring of 
this year's tests, done by specially trained teachers at sites around the 
state, already is underway and reflects the panel's suggestions, Dawson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The report comes as CLAS, which is also under attack from religious 
conservatives for the contents of its reading and writing tests, faces an 
uncertain future. Next week, legislators will work on a compromise bill that 
would continue the system -- renamed the California Comprehensive Testing 
Program in state budget sessions this summer -- while addressing many of the 
criticisms. 
</P>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson's education adviser, Maureen DiMarco, who has been critical 
of how the testing has been developed and carried out, said the report "not 
only validates our concerns and the concerns of others but also gives us even 
greater impetus to continue to work to revise the assessment system." 
</P>
<P>
 The governor's insistence on individual scores could be met by adding more 
traditional, skills-measuring methods, such as multiple-choice questions, she 
added, noting some of the revisions sought by her boss and other CLAS critics 
already have been added to the proposed legislation.

 RAMS STILL WANT YOU: One benefit of the Rams having one foot out the door 
toward a new home: Prices haven't changed, but it's easier to get good season 
tickets this year. A pair of season seats runs $460 (high level), $600 (upper 
level) or $700 (club level.) Individual game tickets are $23, $30 or $35. . . . 
The Rams' home opener at Anaheim Stadium is Sept. 4, against the Arizona 
Cardinals. . . . Two home exhibition games before that: New England Patriots 
(Aug. 13) and the Los Angeles Raiders (Aug. 20). 
</P>
<P>
 BILLBOARD TRUTH: The Rams are already on their way, if you believe a billboard 
on Bristol Street in Santa Ana. It says in huge letters: "The Rams are Moving." 
That's only slightly misleading. . . . They are moving -- along with all the 
other National Football Conference teams -- from CBS to Fox TV. The Rams' TV 
debut will be their first away game on Sept. 11 at Atlanta. 
</P>

 ADD FAME: The first five to be honored at the new Huntington Beach Surfing 
Walk of Fame came from many candidates. But in the women's category, Joyce 
Hoffman was the sentimental local favorite -- and the winner. "I'm delighted," 
says Hoffman, 47, of Capistrano Beach, who plans to attend Thursday's unveiling 
ceremonies. Hoffman won the women's World Cup in surfing five straight years in 
the 1960s. And she still surfs. . . . "Though not in the dead of winter 
anymore," she says. "I got a little too old for that." 
</P>
<P>
 BLACK & WHITE ISSUE: In the Franciscan Fountains area of Huntington Beach, 
near spacious Central Park, homeowners face a problem they hadn't expected when 
they moved in: It's skunks. . . . Some say they're coming from a nearby creek 
channel, or maybe scurrying from their hideaways because of a new housing 
development in the area. Whichever, resident Chuck Barbara says there are 
"skunks in every back yard" in the neighborhood, either spraying their putrid 
aroma or drowning in the pools. City officials this week said they'd try to do 
something.

NEWS ANALYSIS; POLITICALLY SOFTER APPROACH ENTERS HEALTH CARE PAGEANT; 
LEGISLATION: SENATE LEADER'S PLAN EASES COST CONTROLS AND EMPLOYER MANDATES. 
THAT COULD WOO SUPPORT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The health care reform plan that Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell 
(D-Me.) unveiled Tuesday offers his fellow Democrats a tempting escape from 
immediate political peril -- a way to take a giant step back from the thicket 
of government price controls and federal mandates that provoked so much of the 
criticism and concern over President Clinton's original proposals. 
</P>
<P>
 But Mitchell's politically attractive approach comes at a potential price for 
American consumers, the business community and the nation's health care system: 
He has abandoned many of the tough, government-enforced cost control measures 
that are central to the Democratic alternative under consideration in the 
House. In their place, Mitchell would rely on watered-down cost containment 
measures and -- probably more important -- on a continuation of recent trends 
toward slower growth in the rise of health costs nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the Clinton plan, or the similar blueprint put forward by House 
Majority Leader Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.) last week, Mitchell's approach 
offers a strong vote of confidence that the free market can ultimately extend 
high-quality, affordable medical coverage to nearly all Americans -- with only 
occasional nudges from Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 If, however, Mitchell's gamble on the free market should come up short, 
consumers could see costs and taxes begin to climb or the quality and freedom 
of choice of their health care begin to erode -- or all of the above. 
</P>
<P>
 Gone from Mitchell's Senate proposal are such features as drug price controls, 
strict caps on health insurance premiums and provisions for the mandatory use 
of government-sponsored insurance buying cooperatives. 
</P>
<P>
 While critics have challenged the government-mandated cost control provisions 
of the House proposal, the absence of comparable features in Mitchell's plan 
raises questions about his ability to finance a sharp expansion of health 
coverage. Those doubts are heightened by the fact that Mitchell's plan 
envisions the creation of a rich package of health benefits similar to the best 
corporate plans now on the market. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell's goal is coverage for 95% of Americans, somewhat short of Clinton's 
call for "universal" coverage. But the senator provided few hard-cost estimates 
for the major provisions of his proposal, and the Congressional Budget Office 
has not yet completed its official analysis of the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 One concrete feature for financing Mitchell's plan is a 25% "assessment" on 
so-called "high-cost" health care plans, that is, plans whose costs for basic 
services exceed still-to-be-established federal guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
 It is unclear exactly how such a penalty would be imposed in practice, but it 
almost certainly could mean a direct or indirect cost increase for millions of 
Americans whose employers are paying substantially above average costs under 
their existing insurance programs. This is especially true in regions where the 
trend toward health maintenance organizations and managed care are much less 
advanced than in California. 
</P>
<P>
 Such increases could come as a shock to many middle-class Americans who now 
enjoy health care coverage that they consider normal, not luxurious -- 
including wide freedom to choose doctors under the traditional fee-for-service 
system. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, the ability of such an assessment to control costs significantly 
remains unproved. 
</P>
<P>
 As the battle over health care reform comes down to the wire, the Clinton 
proposal has been left for dead politically. Both Congress and the White House 
will focus their efforts in the weeks ahead on the Mitchell and Gephardt 
proposals. Reform, if it comes this year, will be some combination of those two 
approaches. 
</P>
<P>
 Above all, Mitchell's plan differs from both the Clinton and Gephardt 
proposals on employer mandates, the issue that has become the key dividing line 
in this year's health care debate. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than establishing mandates right away, Mitchell's plan would call for 
relatively small mandates only to be triggered under certain circumstances -- 
and perhaps only in certain states -- after the turn of the century. 
</P>
<P>
 Failure to achieve a 95% coverage rate by the turn of the century would 
trigger automatic employer mandates in states with low coverage rates under 
Mitchell's plan, something a future Congress could overturn. 
</P>
<P>
 Under his proposal, the mandates would require companies and employees to each 
pay 50% of the costs of insurance premiums, compared with an 80% employer 
contribution under the Gephardt formula. Moreover, if federal costs of 
providing subsidies for the working poor and others exceed set guidelines, then 
Congress will be forced to reduce the subsidies. Yet without sufficient 
subsidies, health care insurance would remain unaffordable for a larger 
percentage of Americans, triggering the mandates. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell stresses that he is confident that despite such questions, his plan 
will prod the free market to gradually increase the rate of insurance coverage, 
thus avoiding his mandate triggers. 
</P>
<P>
 "My bill . . . lays the groundwork for universal coverage through a voluntary 
system," he said in asking his colleagues to act in the coming weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan clearly draws heavily on the compromise crafted by the Senate Finance 
Committee, which the CBO criticized for pushing off too much responsibility to 
the states for managing and supervising a new health care system. 
</P>
<P>
 The CBO argues that the states are ill-equipped to take a leading role in the 
overhaul of an industry that accounts for one-seventh of the American economy. 
Mitchell said Tuesday that he expects the CBO to offer the same criticism of 
his plan as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Mitchell's efforts to find a pro-market, middle way in the health care 
policy debate drew praise from Senate moderates Tuesday. "George Mitchell has 
taken a major step forward on health care legislation based on market reforms 
rather than relying on bureaucratic mandates and regulations," said Sen. John 
B. Breaux (D-La.). 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell's bill even attracted relatively sympathetic comments from business 
groups that have been dead-set against both Clinton's plan and the House 
version of health care reform. The National Assn. of Manufacturers, for 
instance, complained that it had some qualms about Mitchell's plan but said 
that "it improves upon the House leadership's package" and noted that it should 
not create broad new government activities requiring mandatory federal 
spending. 
</P>
<P>
 "The most important distinction between the two bills is that the Senate plan 
wisely stays away from creating a new entitlement program," said NAM President 
Jerry Jasinowski. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the House leadership proposal creates a major expansion of the 
Medicare system to provide a source of insurance coverage for millions of 
workers at small companies and for the unemployed. The Senate plan, by 
contrast, assumes that market reforms can be relied upon to make it so 
attractive to employers that they will voluntarily buy insurance for their 
workers over the next six years. 
</P>
<P>
 Both proposals, meanwhile, provide subsidies for the working poor and small 
firms with low-wage employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell hopes to pay for his plan, including the subsidies, with savings from 
Medicare, the federal health plan now available for those over 65 and the 
disabled, and the elimination of Medicaid, the federal health program for the 
poor. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Mitchell has sought to avoid yet another major flap over 
cigarette taxes by accepting a 45 cent-per pack tax that has already passed the 
tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee and which is included in Gephardt's 
proposal as well.

BUS WORKERS OK PACT, END STRIKE; TRANSPORTATION: MTA OFFICIALS SAY TWO-THIRDS 
OF BUSES WILL BE IN OPERATION TODAY. THE AGENCY'S SMALL SAVINGS IN THE CONTRACT 
RAISE QUESTIONS ABOUT WALKOUT'S HIGH COST.

 Striking mechanics Tuesday overwhelmingly approved a new contract with the 
Metropolitan Transportation Authority, halting the transit walkout and 
signaling the gradual return of normal bus service to Los Angeles streets. 
</P>
<P>
 MTA officials vowed to deploy two-thirds of a fleet of 1,900 buses along usual 
routes today and bring relief to hundreds of thousands of frustrated mass 
transit passengers stranded by the nine-day strike. As a gesture to those who 
have been inconvenienced, fares will remain 50 cents on buses and the Blue Line 
trolley through Saturday. Full service is expected by Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm happy we have our jobs back," said Renee Navarre, a 40-year-old West 
Covina mechanic. "Everything can get back to normal." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the agreement was greeted with cheers from commuters at crowded 
stops, the new contract only provides small savings to the MTA, raising 
questions about the high toll paid by the agency, the strikers and thwarted bus 
riders. The strike is expected to cause a 5% drop in ridership, MTA officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 They estimate that the contract will save the MTA about $9.4 million over 
three years, $6 million of it the first year -- or just 0.2% of the agency's 
$2.9-billion annual budget for the current fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't worth it," said MTA board member James Cragin, a Gardena city 
councilman. "We all lost." 
</P>
<P>
 But County Supervisor Ed Edelman, MTA chairman, said the contract would help 
streamline the agency, which already has approved a fare hike effective this 
fall in an effort to balance its books. 
</P>
<P>
 "What was worked out in the agreement will be a help to the MTA in terms of 
being able to do things more efficiently," Edelman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Union members ratified the settlement 1,050 to 104 after a noisy 2 1/2-hour 
meeting at the Los Angeles Convention Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Blatz, 49, of Canoga Park, a mechanic for 15 years, said that when the 
vote was announced, "I felt the surge -- 'let's go back to work!' " 
</P>
<P>
 "It's better than we expected, but not as good as we wanted," said Efraim 
Garcia, a 49-year-old mechanic. 
</P>
<P>
 Forged after marathon negotiating sessions, the pact calls for concessions 
from both the union and the transit agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Union members will receive small wage increases in the second and third years 
of the three-year contract, increased sick pay and the promise that 63 recently 
laid-off mechanics will be rehired. Negotiators solved the biggest sticking 
point -- the issue of subcontracting work to private companies -- by agreeing 
to establish a joint committee to review any controversial contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm glad it's over," said Mike Bujosa, president of the Amalgamated Transit 
Union. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 1,100 mechanics and service attendants swarmed to the massive South 
Hall auditorium at the Convention Center to learn for the first time details of 
the proposed settlement, which came after an all-night negotiating session that 
ended before dawn Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 At 3 p.m. Tuesday, an upbeat Bujosa moved through the crowd outside the 
auditorium, heading upstairs for the meeting hall. Mechanics tugged at his 
elbow, asking him what did he really think of the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're fine," he said. "But it's up to you guys." 
</P>
<P>
 Many in the hall were ready to go back to work, feeling impatient for a 
paycheck and restless with walking the picket line. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to see this resolved today," said Armando Urena, a 39-year-old 
Southgate mechanic who has worked for the transit agency for 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Bujosa launched the meeting by reading a 10-page summary of the settlement. 
When the wage freeze for the first year was announced, the crowd booed. About 4 
p.m., the reading concluded and the mechanics and service attendants applauded. 
After 30 minutes of discussion, union officials passed out yellow paper 
ballots. Members trickled out of the hall as soon as they had voted. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got a good contract," beamed Steve Hearn III, a 20-year veteran mechanic. 
</P>
<P>
 Several workers, however, disapproved of the settlement, saying that the union 
had conceded too much on the issue of subcontracting. Even the establishment of 
a committee, some argue, makes the union increasingly vulnerable to the loss of 
union jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 "They definitely gave in on subcontracting. We should have stayed out longer. 
That week was for nothing," said Sergio Barron, 33, a mechanic who has worked 
at the agency for four years. 
</P>
<P>
 Barron emerged from the meeting with two other members, shouting: "Vote no!" 
</P>
<P>
 About 5,000 clerks and bus and train drivers reached tentative agreements last 
month, the drivers on July 24 and the clerks the next day. But those unions 
walked out in support of the mechanics and service attendants. All the contract 
expired June 30. 
</P>
<P>
 The walkout dealt a devastating blow to the region's transit system, as MTA 
officials could only deploy about 17% of the usual 1,900 buses on 200 routes. 
Riders were left stranded or endured delays of up to several hours. People with 
night jobs, such as security guards, were offered no possibility of service as 
the transit system -- which normally runs around-the-clock -- stopped about 6 
p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 When Hilda Rodriguez, standing at a Downtown bus stop, learned that the strike 
was over, the 40-year-old receptionist was jubilant. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fantastic!" said Rodriguez, who figured that the commute from her Van Nuys 
home to an office Downtown was bound to improve dramatically. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodriguez, like the about 500,000 other bus riders in the area, desperately 
hoped for a quick settlement. Transportation officials too waited uneasily for 
a conclusion to what has been Los Angeles' longest transit strike in 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Several MTA board members touted the settlement, saying it was an equitable 
solution during tough financial times. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan, an MTA board member, said: "It's going to 
allow for much more efficient running of the MTA." 
</P>
<P>
 Under the settlement agreement, union members will not be granted wage 
increases until the second year of the three-year contract. In that year, they 
will get a 30-cent-per-hour increase and the following year, a 1.5% increase in 
wages plus a cost-of-living adjustment. 
</P>
<P>
 In an effort to reduce the agency's costs, the pact calls for newly hired 
service attendants to start at $12.50 an hour -- instead of the current 
starting salary of $16.26 per hour. 
</P>
<P>
 The new contract also calls for: 
</P>
<P>
 * Union members to receive sick pay for the first day of a reported illness. 
Currently, sick pay does not kick in until the second day. 
</P>
<P>
 * The 63 mechanics laid off in July as the agency cut its staff to be rehired 
within the next two years. 
</P>
<P>
 * A reduction in the amount paid for health benefits. The MTA now pays $573 in 
monthly health benefits per union member -- an amount that will be reduced to 
$533. 
</P>
<P>
 Union and MTA officials proposed solving the most controversial issue -- 
subcontracting -- by establishing a joint union-MTA committee to review any 
controversial bids, or contracts that union members want to keep in-house. 
</P>
<P>
 Union officials long have opposed such contracting with private companies 
because they fear that the cost-cutting measure will lead to the loss of union 
jobs. The agreement, however, guarantees that no union member will lose his or 
her job because of a subcontract. The Walkout Ends 
</P>
<P>
 Mechanics and service attendants overwhelmingly approved a new contract, 
ending Los Angeles' first transit strike in 12 years. Here's a look at several 
key aspects of the three-year contract: 
</P>
<P>
 THE CONTRACT 
</P>
<P>
 * Wages: No increases in the first year. A 30-cent-per-hour increase in the 
second year. A 1.5% increase in the third year and a cost-of-living adjustment. 
</P>
<P>
 * Maintenance assistants: Newly hired maintenance assistants will start at 
$12.50 per hour instead of the current $16.26 per hour. 
</P>
<P>
 * Sick pay: Union members will receive sick pay for the first day of a 
reported illness; now, sick pay does not begin until the second day. 
</P>
<P>
 * Subcontracting: A joint union-MTA committee will review bids for 
subcontracting. 
</P>
<P>
 * Rehires: The 63 recently laid-off mechanics will be rehired within two 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 * Layoffs: No Amalgamated Transit Union employee will be laid off as a result 
of subcontracting. 
</P>
<P>
 * Overtime: Overtime assignments will be distributed equitably among employees 
on a rotating basis. 
</P>
<P>
 * Smoking: Prohibited, except in areas where it is expressly authorized. 
</P>
<P>
 WHAT'S OPERATING 
</P>
<P>
 * MTA officials hope to run two-thirds of normal bus and rail service today. 
</P>
<P>
 * For information: call (800) COMMUTE 
</P>
<P>
 * Fares on buses and Blue Line will be 50 cents through Saturday.

U.S. TROOP SAFETY A KEY CONCERN IN RWANDA MISSION; AFRICA: DESPITE POTENTIAL 
FOR VIOLENCE, AID EFFORT HAS RUN SMOOTHLY. OFFICIALS HOPE TO AVOID ANOTHER 
SOMALIA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 U.S. Army Lt. Gen. Daniel Schroeder, a ramrod-straight soldier with a closely 
shaved head and a razor-sharp manner, paused only once in his rapid-fire 
answers to a gaggle of reporters at a recent briefing here. 
</P>
<P>
 Schroeder, head of the task force running Operation Support Hope, the U.S. 
attempt to alleviate the suffering of more than 1 million Rwandan refugees, 
said he was considering using an American truck company to transport food and 
refugees in Rwanda. 
</P>
<P>
 "The thing that concerns us is the security issue," he said. Then came the one 
pause: "It's the unknown. It's the uncertainty." 
</P>
<P>
 So far, in its first few days, the U.S. operation in Zaire and Rwanda has 
encountered many daunting problems, but American soldiers at least have been 
spared the experience of their comrades in Somalia last year: being shot at by 
the people they were trying to help. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the potential for trouble remains high in the consciousness of U.S. 
officials in Africa and in Washington. They point to two major worries: the 
troops, 20,000 to 40,000 strong, who remain loyal to the losing Hutu side of 
the Rwandan civil war and who might try to interfere with U.S. aid efforts; and 
the victorious Tutsi minority, who might want to exact revenge on Hutu refugees 
returning to Rwanda from Zaire. 
</P>
<P>
 By most reliable accounts, Rwanda has been peaceful -- partly because much of 
it is almost deserted -- since the army of the former Hutu-dominated government 
fled across the border to Zaire two weeks ago, urging or pushing much of the 
terrified population to flee with it. But no one knows if the peace will last. 
The legacy of ethnic massacres and bloodletting may not be simple to erase. 
</P>
<P>
 Driven from their country by the forces of the victorious Tutsi-led Rwandan 
Patriotic Front (RPF), the Hutu troops remain just across the border in Zaire. 
Thousands are camped for miles along the road that runs west from the border, 
and paymasters handed out thick wads of cash to the uniformed troops on a 
recent afternoon. Estimates of both the army's size and its strength vary, 
because many tossed down their weapons when they crossed the border. Others, 
however, kept their guns. 
</P>
<P>
 The International Committee of the Red Cross has refused to assist the Rwandan 
soldiers, except the wounded, until they are disarmed and put in camps as 
military detainees, as required under the Geneva Convention. Hutu leaders, 
however, have vowed to keep their forces intact and to lead them back one day 
to renew the fight against the Tutsis. 
</P>
<P>
 During the civil war, many of those troops carried out horrific massacres of 
both Tutsis and of Hutus accused of collaborating with the Tutsis. Hutu 
government forces also murdered and then skinned the bodies of 10 Belgian 
peacekeepers during the war's early days. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, the Hutu soldiers have not tried to interfere with U.S. or 
international aid efforts, but if they begin to do so, the American presence 
could rapidly become more dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
 "As long as they retain their weapons, you have a problem," said Shawn 
Messick, a Pentagon special operations officer who arrived here recently. "It's 
part of our operating environment here." 
</P>
<P>
 The most immediate source of potential conflict centers on efforts by the 
United States, the United Nations and private relief agencies to encourage 
refugees to return home to Rwanda. The Hutu leadership opposes that and has 
tried actively to keep the refugees in Zaire, leading to concerns that if the 
repatriation effort becomes more successful, the Hutus might try to thwart it 
by force. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, the Hutus have received aid from the government of Zaire. U.S. 
officials have tried to exert what influence they can on Zaire to ensure that 
the aid does not continue and have received assurances that it will not. But 
given the notorious corruption of Zaire's government, officials concede they 
cannot be sure those assurances will stick. 
</P>
<P>
 Persuading the refugees to return will, of course, depend in part on the 
behavior of the civil war's winning side. The new Rwandan government has 
promised not to exact reprisals against returning refugees, but scattered 
reports indicate some reprisals already have begun. 
</P>
<P>
 That, in turn, raises the question of what, if anything, U.S. forces will do 
if civilians in Rwanda once again come under attack. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials insist that whatever happens, American troops will not take 
part in efforts to protect Rwandan civilians. That, officials say, will be up 
to a separate U.N. peacekeeping force. 
</P>
<P>
 If the violence escalates, however, the arm's-length stance of the U.S. force 
could be increasingly uncomfortable. 
</P>
<P>
 As they await the day, still some weeks away, on which the U.N. force becomes 
fully operational, U.S. officials concede that much depends on the goodwill of 
the new government. 
</P>
<P>
 For all that, experienced relief workers argue that the situation in Rwanda 
differs greatly from the one in Somalia. Indeed, some fear that the American 
public drew the wrong lesson from Somalia. The U.S. military saved lives in 
that country, the relief workers note. The problem was, they also tried to 
quickly refashion a country of powerful ethnic clans into a multi-party 
democracy. And "mission creep" meant the rules and the goals were constantly 
changing. 
</P>
<P>
 "The difference is, this is a genuine humanitarian operation with no political 
or military implications," said Steffan de Mistura, U.N. Children's Fund 
representative in Somalia. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think we are going to have 'mission creep,' " Messick said. "We 
didn't come in with a blank slate, like we did in Somalia, saying 'Do good.' We 
came in with very specific tasks, and that's what we're going to do." 
</P>
<P>
 For now, officials say security for U.S. troops is a concern, but not a 
problem. The troops inside Rwanda have been given orders not to leave the 
airport where they are based. The 98 troops now in Goma live in tents next to a 
crowded road with no protection other than a roll of concertina wire. Most of 
the soldiers go unarmed, and none wear flak vests or other combat gear. 
</P>
<P>
 If problems do develop, officials say, the U.S. troops are prepared to defend 
themselves. "That's why you send in the U.S. military, not the Peace Corps," 
National Security Adviser Anthony Lake said at a recent White House meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Drogin reported from Goma and Lauter from Washington.

TRIAD WORKERS STICK BY TROUBLED HOSPITAL FIRM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IRENE WIELAWSKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nurse Denise O'Neil's phone was ringing off the hook last winter with job 
offers, but she was heartsick over the reason. 
</P>
<P>
 Her employer, Sherman Oaks Hospital and Health Center, had just been thrust 
into the public spotlight as one of two hospitals owned by financially troubled 
Triad Healthcare of Encino. Every week, it seemed, the newspapers brought more 
news of corporate turmoil, staggering debt and, finally, bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
 There was no shortage of rumors, many of them heralding the hospital's 
imminent sale -- even closure -- as Triad's chief creditor, the state of 
California, sought to recover from a $167-million loan default by the company. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the potential of us being disillusioned by the situation started 
(recruiters) calling," said O'Neil, director of the hospital's AIDS unit. 
</P>
<P>
 But O'Neil has decided to stay -- as have many of the hospital's employees and 
physicians -- despite the uncertainty clouding Triad's future. 
</P>
<P>
 Their reasons are a mixture of the pragmatic and the emotional, and say much 
about the business of hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
 Triad's financial problems stem in part from the superheated 1980s, when 
hospitals, like other investments, were bought or sold entirely for their 
profit potential, often in heavily leveraged deals. But because hospitals 
provide an intensely personal service -- caring for the sick -- they tend to 
have deep community roots and staffs that are loyal to patients first, 
corporate owners second. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have been owned by three or four or five corporations -- I've lost track," 
said Linda Ching, director of nurses at the hospital, who over the years 
employed a dismissive catch phrase to calm staff about the latest change of 
ownership. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's corporate," she would tell them. "We're the hospital."' 
</P>
<P>
 But the $167-million debt that Triad loaded onto its hospitals when it 
acquired them in 1991 is not so easy to dismiss. That is especially true in 
Southern California's glutted hospital market where simply breaking even is 
reason enough to uncork the champagne. 
</P>
<P>
 Managed-care health insurance plans have drastically reduced the number of 
patients in hospitals and the length of their stays. In 1993, average occupancy 
in Southern California hospitals dipped to a historic low -- 48% -- and more 
than half the hospitals closed the year in the red, according to the Hospital 
Council of Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Triad's hospitals have had even lower occupancy, with 156-bed Sherman Oaks 
Hospital hovering at 31% and 138-bed West Valley Hospital and Health Center in 
Canoga Park barely managing to fill 22% of its beds, according to staff. 
</P>
<P>
 Compounding the occupancy problems was Triad's default in July, 1993, on the 
$167-million state-insured loan, which brought unusual public scrutiny. News 
reports severely undermined confidence in the stability, and potentially in the 
quality, of the hospitals, according to doctors and other staff. 
</P>
<P>
 Triad had used a state loan guarantee program called Cal-Mortgage, leaving 
state taxpayers potentially responsible for paying off bondholders. The loan 
default, the largest in Cal-Mortgage's 25-year history, effectively shut down 
the program for six months and spawned legislative and departmental 
investigations that continue today. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody was down in the dumps, reading the newspaper from one day to the 
next," said Froyla Alden, director of nurses at West Valley hospital. "They 
were crying in my office, wondering if they were going to have a job." 
</P>
<P>
 Some doctors, feeling uneasy about the situation, diverted patients to other 
hospitals where they had admitting privileges. Dr. Eugene Sollman, an 
obstetrician at West Valley and chairman of the hospital's board of trustees, 
said the number of doctors admitting to West Valley dropped 22%. 
</P>
<P>
 The problems seemed insurmountable, giving rise to rumors that the hospitals 
would close. But Sherman Oaks and West Valley had several things going for them 
that doomsayers overlooked. 
</P>
<P>
 One of them, ironically, was the generally poor hospital market in Southern 
California. If hospital staff members were looking to bolt for more secure 
employment, they found the pickings slim. 
</P>
<P>
 "A few people left, but really overall the percentage was quite small," said 
Dr. Peter Miao, chief of the medical staff at Sherman Oaks Hospital. "Economics 
are bad for hospitals now, and there is no job security anywhere." 
</P>
<P>
 Also working in the hospitals' favor was the long tenure and loyalty of 
employees. Ching and Alden, the nursing directors, say many on their staffs 
have been at the hospitals for their entire professional lives. In specialties 
involving long-term treatment -- notably in the AIDS and burn units at Sherman 
Oaks Hospital -- the nurses, doctors and support staff typically develop close 
ties to patients and their families. 
</P>
<P>
 "The experience of trying to help those kinds of patients makes for an 
enormous sense of resolve and unity among the staff," said David Langness, a 
Hospital Council vice president. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the hospitals had to figure out how to cut costs, preserve quality and 
bring in patients. For the second half of 1993, they were stymied by corporate 
turmoil at Triad. The company's board of directors switched management 
consultants, fired its president and battled the state for control of its 
hospitals. Triad ultimately found stability in U.S Bankruptcy Court, preempting 
a move by state officials to place Triad and its hospitals into receivership. 
</P>
<P>
 Dennis Simon, a Price Waterhouse consultant who specializes in turning around 
failing companies, was appointed bankruptcy trustee in March. 
</P>
<P>
 By then, cynicism had taken hold of many Triad employees who had seen would-be 
rescuers come and go. But Simon was unusually visible, according to staff at 
the hospital. He immediately began meeting with all levels of employees and 
candidly presenting both the plight and prospects of the hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
 While demanding greater efficiency and tighter budgets, Simon slashed away at 
corporate overhead. For example, he canceled the lease on a penthouse office 
occupied by Triad's former president, Stuart Marylander, until he left the 
company last year. The penthouse lease, plus several others that Simon deemed 
unnecessary, were costing Triad $700,000 annually, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Simon said he also has canceled executive credit cards and stopped severance 
payments to former Triad executives, including Marylander. The Times reported 
in December that Marylander's severance package totaled more than $900,000 over 
three years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have not been paying him since the day I took over," Simon said, adding 
that he has applied to the bankruptcy court for permission to cancel the 
severance packages altogether. 
</P>
<P>
 Marylander's attorney, Robert Fabrikant, declined to comment, saying that 
after consulting with his client, "We didn't feel it was appropriate or us to 
comment on any actions the trustee was taking." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the biggest morale boost has come from Simon's decision to rehire 
Sherman Oaks Hospital's former executive director, David A. Levinsohn, as 
Triad's new chief operating officer. 
</P>
<P>
 The well-regarded Levinsohn resigned as Sherman Oaks' top executive in 
November at the height of the post-default turmoil. "I just didn't feel that I 
had any control," he said, citing the company's financial situation and a 
rapidly deteriorating relationship between corporate headquarters and 
hospital-based managers. 
</P>
<P>
 Simon persuaded Levinsohn in May to take the position vacated by Marylander. 
News of his return had an immediate impact. 
</P>
<P>
 Denise O'Neil, for one, had a lilt in her voice as she turned down job offers. 
One of the few employees whose specialized skills made her in great demand, 
O'Neil said Levinsohn's return reinforced her decision to stick by her patients 
in the AIDS unit. 
</P>
<P>
 "With David here, I just knew we were going to make it," O'Neil said. 
</P>
<P>
 "David is the glue," said Dr. A. Richard Grossman, head of Sherman Oaks' 
renowned burn unit. One of only three in Los Angeles County, it is one of the 
hospital's most coveted assets. Grossman said he has fended off approaches from 
other hospitals who wanted him to relocate the burn unit and its staff. 
</P>
<P>
 Levinsohn and Simon have made pursuing managed care contracts their top 
priority. Blue Cross' Prudent Buyer and CaliforniaCare programs have signed 
contracts with Sherman Oaks, and Health Net signed up with both Triad hospitals 
for patients insured under its Seniority Plus care plan, Triad reported in its 
most recent newsletter. 
</P>
<P>
 West Valley is the more vulnerable of the two Triad hospitals in part because 
of competition from two hospitals less than five miles away. So Levinsohn said 
he is looking at ways to better target services to community needs. The 
hospital is launching a maternity care outreach program to the San Fernando 
Valley's growing Latino community, and recently converted a wing from acute 
medical and surgical care to substance abuse treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 Bankruptcy has given Triad the breather it needed to restructure the hospital 
services, and Levinsohn believes revenues and patient admissions will soon 
improve. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to be in a place where I could make a difference, and I think I can 
here," Levinsohn said. Profile: David A. Levinsohn 
</P>
<P>
 Levinsohn is the new chief operating officer of Triad Healthcare Inc., the 
troubled Encino-based hospital corporation that received federal bankruptcy 
protection after defaulting on a $167-million loan insured by the state.

MITCHELL HEALTH PLAN AIMS TO COVER 95% OF AMERICANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 After weeks of intense consultation and negotiation with his uneasy troops, 
Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.) on Tuesday unveiled a plan 
that abandons much of President Clinton's approach to health reform in favor of 
a more gradual one that expands coverage through voluntary incentives and 
hundreds of billions of dollars in government spending. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell's proposal seeks to assure that at least 95% of Americans would have 
health insurance by the year 2000 -- which is short of Clinton's bottom-line 
goal of guaranteed coverage for every American by a specific date, but is as 
far as the majority leader believes the Senate will go. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal also seeks to make more palatable the element of the Clinton plan 
that many senators of both parties have said they would never accept: a 
requirement that employers pay a share of their workers' health premiums. 
</P>
<P>
 Under Mitchell's proposal, the so-called employer mandate would not take 
effect unless the voluntary measures and subsidies did not succeed in reaching 
the 95% coverage target. Even then, a government commission would first be 
given an opportunity to find other ways of reaching that level, and the mandate 
would not be imposed on states that meet the target. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell also would scale back the employer share, from Clinton's proposed 80% 
to only 50%, and would exempt firms with fewer than 25 workers from having to 
pay anything. 
</P>
<P>
 The Congressional Budget Office has tentatively estimated that the voluntary 
measures will succeed in expanding coverage to 95%, from its current 85%, 
without triggering the mandate. Thus Mitchell's plan provides a degree of 
political cover for senators who oppose mandates, because it gives them grounds 
to claim that the requirement would never go into effect. 
</P>
<P>
 With the release of the Mitchell plan, the stage for the congressional health 
care debate is set. On Friday, House Majority Leader Richard A. Gephardt 
(D-Mo.) released his proposal, which is significantly more far-reaching than 
Mitchell's and includes an employer mandate similar to Clinton's. 
</P>
<P>
 In a statement Tuesday, Clinton praised the Mitchell effort, saying that it 
"provides for" universal coverage and "achieves what the American people want 
-- health coverage that can never be taken away." 
</P>
<P>
 In a speech on the Senate floor, Mitchell described his proposal as "a 
voluntary system" that "builds on the existing American health care system of 
private insurance." 
</P>
<P>
 "Health care reform is a matter of simple justice," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Attendance by senators from both parties was larger than usual as Mitchell 
delivered his remarks -- a tribute to the enormous personal commitment that the 
majority leader has made to the health issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell gave up a chance for a Supreme Court nomination so that he would not 
be distracted in his fight to win passage. Indeed, as he prepares to retire at 
the end of the year, Mitchell clearly hopes to make health care legislation the 
crowning accomplishment of his Senate career. 
</P>
<P>
 Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.) was the first to shake Mitchell's 
hand after the speech. But he quickly made it clear that he plans to give no 
ground in the bruising debate that is set to begin Tuesday and is expected to 
last at least two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 In a statement, Dole brushed aside Mitchell's characterizations of his plan as 
a moderate approach, and said it "is very similar to President Clinton's 
proposal in that it prescribes more government, more taxes and more 
entitlements." 
</P>
<P>
 No final cost estimates are available, and many details of the Mitchell 
proposal remain to be filled in. Its main features, outlined in a 21-page 
summary, include: 
</P>
<P>
 * Subsidies that are aimed at helping low-income people and those who are 
temporarily unemployed afford coverage. By 1997, those earning below the 
poverty level (currently $14,800 for a family of four) would receive enough to 
pay their entire premium; smaller amounts would be available on a sliding scale 
for those earning up to 200% of poverty. 
</P>
<P>
 * A separate program of subsidies for children under 19 and pregnant women 
earning up to 300% of poverty level, with those under 185% receiving enough to 
pay their entire premium. 
</P>
<P>
 * Additional subsidies for employers who elect to begin covering workers who 
previously had no insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 * The establishment of voluntary purchasing cooperatives for individuals and 
firms employing fewer than 500 workers. The idea is to allow them to pool their 
buying power, so that they can negotiate better deals with insurance companies. 
</P>
<P>
 * A series of widely agreed upon changes in insurance industry practices, 
including provisions that would make it easier for people with known illnesses 
to buy coverage and for everyone to take their health insurance with them when 
they leave a job. 
</P>
<P>
 * A requirement that all employers offer their workers the chance to buy at 
least three types of insurance plans. No company is required to pay for that 
coverage, however. 
</P>
<P>
 * A benefits package that is less clearly defined than under Clinton's 
proposal or the House bill. It includes 16 categories of covered services, 
including preventive care, mental health and substance abuse treatment and 
prescription drugs. For those under 22, there is also vision, hearing and 
dental care. 
</P>
<P>
 Abortion coverage is also on the list, but Mitchell conceded that issue is 
likely to be decided in a separate vote on the Senate floor. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the trickiest questions regarding the Mitchell proposal, as well as all 
of the alternatives, is how it would be paid for. 
</P>
<P>
 The vast new subsidy program, which Mitchell estimated would cost about $900 
billion over 10 years, would largely be financed from savings that the 
government estimates it would reap from eliminating much of the current 
Medicaid program and moving those recipients into private plans. 
</P>
<P>
 Congressional aides said the shift could pay as much as 80% of the costs of 
the subsidies. States, meanwhile, would be required to send the amount that 
they are now spending on Medicaid to Washington to help finance the health 
reform effort. 
</P>
<P>
 Additionally, growth in Medicare spending would be trimmed by an estimated $54 
billion over five years, and $278 billion over a decade, which is a somewhat 
smaller reduction than in either the Clinton bill or the House Democratic 
leadership plan. About half of that would go toward the new prescription drug 
benefit and a long-term care program, both of which would benefit the elderly 
the most. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill also includes new taxes, such as: 
</P>
<P>
 * A 45-cent-a-pack hike in the cigarette tax, which is the same as proposed in 
the House Democrats' bill, but significantly lower than the 75-cent increase 
that Clinton suggested. 
</P>
<P>
 * A 1.75% tax on health premiums, which would be used to fund graduate medical 
education and teaching hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
 * A 25% assessment that individuals would pay on health premiums that are more 
expensive than average, which is aimed at discouraging people from buying the 
more generous health plans and is among the plan's chief means of controlling 
costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Although it is still far from clear whether Mitchell has the 50 votes he needs 
to pass the proposal, it was favorably received by the senators whose support 
is most in question: moderate and conservative Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. John B. Breaux (D-La.) called it "a major step in the right direction," 
and praised it for relying on the market, rather than on "bureaucratic mandates 
and regulations." 
</P>
<P>
 Added another moderate, Sen. Kent Conrad (D-N.D.): "I could support this bill. 
This bill has a very good chance of passing." 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) had quietly removed her name as an original 
co-sponsor of the Clinton bill after it encountered a firestorm of criticism. 
But Feinstein spokesman Bill Chandler said Tuesday night that she, too, 
regarded the Mitchell plan as "a major step in the right direction. . . . But 
the senator still has a number of unanswered questions, particularly about the 
cost and financing." 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) has supported both the Clinton and Mitchell 
proposals. 
</P>
<P>
 Also on Tuesday, the Democratic House leadership agreed to delay, until at 
least next Thursday or Friday, floor debate on the health reform plan 
introduced last week by Gephardt. Closing In on a Final Plan 
</P>
<P>
 A look at how the plan proposed by Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell 
(D-Me.) compares to the plan unveiled last week by House Democratic leaders and 
the President's original plan: 
</P>
<P>
 UNIVERSAL COVERAGE 
</P>
<P>
 Senate Democrats: If 95% of Americans not covered by the year 2000, all 
businesses with 25 or more workers would have to split the cost of their 
workers' insurance 50-50. Cigarette tax rises from 24 cents to 69 cents over 
five years. Imposes 1.75% tax on insurance premiums. 
</P>
<P>
 House Democrats: By 1999, require all companies to provide insurance to all 
workers. Employers to pay 80% of premiums, workers 20%. Increase cigarette tax 
by 45 cents a pack. Levy 2% tax on insurance premiums. 
</P>
<P>
 Original Clinton plan (used only as a blueprint, no longer an option): By 
1998, require all companies to provide insurance to all workers. Employers to 
pay 80% of premiums, workers 20%. Increase cigarette tax by 75 cents a pack. 
Levy 1% tax on insurance premiums. 
</P>
<P>
 IMPACT ON MEDICARE 
</P>
<P>
 Senate Democrats: Expand Medicare coverage to cover prescription drugs. 
Includes new long-term program for the severely disabled. 
</P>
<P>
 House Democrats: Expand Medicare coverage to include prescription drugs. As 
state option, begins new long-term care program for some elderly Americans. New 
limits on payments to doctors and hospitals to rein in rate of increase in 
costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Original Clinton plan (used only as a blueprint, no longer an option): Same, 
except long-term care would be required, not an option. 
</P>
<P>
 SUBSIDIES FOR SMALL BUSINESS 
</P>
<P>
 Senate Democrats: Subsidies for firms that expand coverage to all their 
workers. These firms would pay the lesser of 50% of the premium or 8% of each 
newly insured employee's wages. Subsidy ends after five years. 
</P>
<P>
 House Democrats: Provide tax credits for companies of up to 50 workers. 
Subsidy amount varies by size and payroll. Offers companies two options other 
than arranging for insurance on their own: enroll workers in the new Medicare 
Part C program or let them buy into existing federal employees health program. 
</P>
<P>
 Original Clinton plan (used only as a blueprint, no longer an option): Provide 
subsidies to businesses, depending on size and average payroll. 
</P>
<P>
 INSURANCE REFORM 
</P>
<P>
 Senate Democrats: Insurers could charge older customers twice as much as 
younger customers. Firms with fewer than 500 individuals would be in 
community-rated pools. 
</P>
<P>
 House Democrats: Allow states either voluntary or mandatory purchasing pools. 
Forbids insurance companies from charging some customers more than others. 
Would eliminate pre-existing condition exclusions. 
</P>
<P>
 Original Clinton plan (used only as a blueprint, no longer an option): 
Requires all but the largest companies to buy insurance through purchasing 
pools. Forbids insurance companies from charging some customers more than 
others. Eliminates pre-existing condition exclusions. 
</P>
<P>
 COST CONTAINMENT 
</P>
<P>
 Senate Democrats: Imposes 25% tax on high-cost health plans for the amount 
which they exceed a target cost. Creates national panel to monitor expenditures 
and recommend ways to hold down costs. 
</P>
<P>
 House Democrats: Effective in 2001, authorizes the government to establish 
standby price controls on insurance premiums if a national commission deemed 
them necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 Original Clinton plan (used only as a blueprint, no longer an option): 
Effective immediately, establisheds standby federal price controls on insurance 
premiums.

ALTMAN DENIES LYING TO SENATE, HINDERING PROBE; WHITEWATER: EMBATTLED TREASURY 
OFFICIAL SAYS SOME OF HIS PAST STATEMENTS TO CONGRESS MAY HAVE BEEN 
'INCOMPLETE.' REPUBLICANS CHALLENGE HIS TRUTHFULNESS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL ROSS and SARA FRITZ, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Deputy Treasury Secretary Roger Altman, fighting to save his job amid mounting 
criticism of his role in the Whitewater affair, acknowledged Tuesday that some 
of his past statements to Congress may have been "incomplete" and misleading. 
</P>
<P>
 But in his long-awaited appearance at the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban 
Affairs Committee's Whitewater hearings, Altman continued to insist that he 
never intentionally lied to Congress and never sought to interfere with federal 
regulators investigating the failure of an Arkansas thrift owned by a business 
partner of the President and Hillary Rodham Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 "I did not do it myself, and I am not aware of anyone else doing so," Altman 
told the committee. 
</P>
<P>
 With Republican lawmakers angrily calling for his resignation -- and even 
Democrats expressing reservations about his conduct -- Altman passionately 
defended his reputation at what was the dramatic high point of the weeklong 
Senate and House hearings focusing on whether confidential information was 
improperly conveyed to the White House about an investigation in which the 
Clintons had been named as possible witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
 "I read that I have already been convicted and sentenced before a trial has 
even taken place," Altman said of the GOP demands for his resignation, which 
have been multiplying in the wake of allegations that he misled the Senate 
Banking Committee in testimony Feb. 24 about the extent of the contacts that 
Treasury Department officials had about Whitewater with the White House since 
the previous September. 
</P>
<P>
 Altman admitted that his previous testimony appeared to him in retrospect to 
have been "too narrow or perhaps incomplete" and he said that, if he had "to do 
it over again, I would have added more information." 
</P>
<P>
 But with the dramatic aid of a videotape, he sought to shift some of the blame 
for his earlier omissions on Treasury Counsel Jean Hanson, who sat behind 
Altman at the Feb. 24 hearing but failed to correct him even when she knew, 
according to her earlier testimony, that the answers he was giving were not 
complete. 
</P>
<P>
 Looking directly at his chief critic, New York Sen. Alfonse M. D'Amato, the 
Banking Committee's ranking Republican, Altman said he "never intended to 
mislead" Congress and that D'Amato was flat "wrong" in questioning his 
veracity. 
</P>
<P>
 A close friend of Clinton since their college days together, Altman was also 
serving as acting head of the Resolution Trust Corp. last September, when 
federal regulators were examining allegations that federally insured deposits 
from the failed thrift, Madison Guaranty Savings & Loan, had been illegally 
diverted to Whitewater, an Ozarks resort development that the Clintons owned 
jointly with James B. McDougal, Madison's chairman. 
</P>
<P>
 Whitewater special counsel Robert B. Fiske Jr., who has been investigating the 
Whitewater affair since January, has already concluded that White House and 
Treasury Department aides violated no criminal laws in the 40-odd meetings, 
phone calls and other discussions they had about Madison over a six-month 
period that began in the fall of last year, when the Whitewater affair was 
unfolding. 
</P>
<P>
 But citing damaging references to Whitewater in memoranda, diaries and notes 
kept by many of those involved in the discussions, D'Amato and others have 
alleged that the contacts nevertheless represented an attempt, in violation of 
RTC procedures, by Altman and other political appointees at Treasury to keep 
the White House informed of the status of the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Like other Administration officials who have testified before him, Altman 
stressed that neither he nor any one else at Treasury ever sought to interfere 
with the RTC investigation, which has since been turned over to Fiske. 
</P>
<P>
 To the "best of my knowledge," no confidential information relating to the 
probe was ever imparted to the White House and no "criminal or civil aspects" 
of the case were ever "compromised, delayed or altered in any way," Altman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Altman's recollection appeared at times to falter when it came to 
recalling disputed details of several events, and his explanation of why he 
gave seemingly misleading testimony at the Feb. 24 hearing was greeted with 
disbelief by Republicans and barely concealed skepticism by even many of the 
panel's Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked pointedly about the discussions at the February hearing, Altman 
testified that there had been only one "substantive" contact -- a Feb. 2 
meeting at which he briefed White House officials on the RTC's procedures for 
filing civil claims in the Madison case. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, as other officials have since acknowledged, there had been as many as 
40 meetings, telephone conversations and other Whitewater-related contacts in 
the months preceding Altman's first appearance before the Banking Committee, 
including at least four involving Altman personally. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the questions from skeptical senators on Tuesday centered on why 
Altman neglected to mention the other contacts when he testified in February. 
They also demanded to know why he failed to mention a key exchange during the 
Feb. 2 meeting when he informed White House Counsel Bernard Nussbaum that he 
had decided to disqualify himself as acting RTC chief from further 
consideration of all Whitewater-related matters. 
</P>
<P>
 White House officials have since conceded that Nussbaum opposed the decision 
and after the meeting Altman seemed to waver, telling senior aides that he had 
decided "to sleep on it." He finally announced his decision to disqualify, or 
recuse, himself on Feb. 25, a day after the Senate hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 Altman testified on Tuesday that he didn't tell the senators about the 
decision or his conversation with Nussbaum because they never asked him about 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Had I been asked about recusal, I would have responded forthrightly," he 
said. However, he added that he did not deem it relevant at the time because he 
had already made a "de facto" decision to recuse himself from Whitewater 
matters, rendering a formal recusal irrelevant. "Whether I recused myself or 
not would have had no impact on the case -- none whatsoever," Altman insisted. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the most heated exchanges came when Altman disputed the Republicans' 
assertions that he sought to conceal the extent of the Whitewater contacts he 
had had with White House officials before the Feb. 24 hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 "You did not tell the truth!" shouted Sen. Phil Gramm (R-Tex.) at one point. 
"Senator, I told the truth," Altman responded in a voice edged with anger. 
</P>
<P>
 As the tone of the hearing turned more partisan, tempers flared between 
Democrats and Republicans when D'Amato pointedly accused Altman of lying to the 
committee about a meeting he had with White House Deputy Counsel Harold M. 
Ickes on Feb. 3, in which Altman informed Ickes of his decision not to 
immediately disqualify himself from matters relating to Madison. 
</P>
<P>
 But Democrats joined in the criticism of Altman's insistence that he could 
"not recall" asking Hanson, the Treasury Department's top lawyer, to tell the 
White House last September that nine RTC referrals mentioning the Clintons as 
potential witnesses were being forwarded to the Justice Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Hanson has said she relayed the information to Nussbaum at a Sept. 29 White 
House meeting because Altman had instructed her to do so. Her own credibility 
called into question on several counts, Hanson insisted during seven hours of 
grueling testimony on Monday that she did not know Nussbaum personally and 
would never have approached someone so high up in the White House on such a 
sensitive matter without Altman's authorization. 
</P>
<P>
 Altman said he did not believe that he asked Hanson to brief Nussbaum, but 
indicated that she could have "mistakenly inferred" that she should do that. 
</P>
<P>
 Several Democrats found that explanation difficult to accept, however. "It's 
hard to believe that counsel for the Treasury is going to wind up at the White 
House in such a meeting unless someone asked her to go," Sen. John Kerry 
(D-Mass.) told Altman pointedly. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's clear that there is a discrepancy between your testimony and that of Ms. 
Hanson," added Sen. Jim Sasser (D-Tenn.), who likewise indicated that he was 
troubled by Altman's answers. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the daylong hearing served less to restore the luster to Altman's 
tarnished credibility with the senators than it did to underscore the many 
discrepancies between his recollection of events and Hanson's. 
</P>
<P>
 Hanson testified that she knew Altman was giving incomplete answers to the 
questions about the White House-Treasury contacts but was given no opportunity 
to correct him at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 However, a videotape of the hearing that was replayed on Tuesday showed that 
Altman turned to consult with Hanson after responding to a question about the 
contacts by saying that the only "substantive" one he was aware of was the Feb. 
2 meeting to brief White House officials on RTC procedures. 
</P>
<P>
 The tape did not reveal what Altman whispered to Hanson, but it shows her a 
moment later vigorously shaking her head in the negative. 
</P>
<P>
 Altman indicated that she was confirming to him with that gesture that he had 
not omitted anything from his answer. 
</P>
<P>
 But while insisting he had testified truthfully, Altman acknowledged that he 
had made some mistakes in not disclosing more information -- an error he blamed 
on his misunderstanding of some of the questions put to him at the earlier 
hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 However, his biggest mistake, he indicated, was in not disqualifying himself 
from the Whitewater case sooner. "In retrospect, I should perhaps have recused 
myself right off the bat and then some of this controversy would have been 
avoided," he said.

COLUMN ONE; FACING PERIL OF AIDS IN NEPAL; THE HIMALAYAN KINGDOM IS FERTILE 
GROUND FOR HIV. HEALTH WORKERS TRY TO COUNTER A DEEPLY INGRAINED SEX TRADE, 
ROOTED IN POVERTY AND A CASTE SOCIETY THAT TREATS WOMEN HARSHLY.

<P>
 In the antiseptic parlance of public health professionals, Amarwati is a 
"commercial sex worker" and potential "vector" for AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 Two or three times a day, the 21-year-old woman with black curly hair and a 
nervous smile brings men into her modest home with stained yellow walls, and 
steers them toward a hard wood-frame bed. 
</P>
<P>
 As a fan overhead whips the warm air, she and her clients have sex. 
</P>
<P>
 She earns $2 to $3 daily. Amarwati, who has an 8-year-old daughter, is not 
unusual. So many women in her district of this lowland town in midwestern Nepal 
are prostitutes that a patch of dusty ground across from their homes seems, 
like a freakish garden drawn by Salvador Dali, to have bloomed with a crop of 
used, shriveled condoms. 
</P>
<P>
 Amarwati and her neighbors are among the reasons that officials in this small 
landlocked kingdom, renowned for its snowy Himalayan vistas and exotic culture, 
are now bracing for the onslaught of the human immunodeficiency virus, which 
causes AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 "All symptoms point to the fact that when HIV begins to spread with velocity 
here, it will explode," said Dr. Daniel Tarantola, director of the 
International AIDS Program at the Harvard School of Public Health's 
Francois-Xavier Bagnoud Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Nepal's looming crisis is part of a general, alarming trend. Last winter, the 
number of HIV-infected people in south and southeastern Asia overtook the total 
of infected people in the industrialized world for the first time, according to 
a study published this year by Harvard's Global AIDS Policy Coalition. 
</P>
<P>
 Judging by available evidence, the study concluded, the number of people who 
are infected yearly with HIV has begun to decline everywhere -- except in Asia. 
</P>
<P>
 The trauma and challenges of AIDS, whose first cases were recognized among gay 
American men in 1981, are unfortunately not new. But as health professionals 
are learning, dealing with HIV as it speeds through previously uncontaminated 
societies requires much more than duplicating approaches used in the United 
States, Africa or elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Take Amarwati. Since she was 12 and her family desperately needed money, she 
says, she has been engaging in prostitution. Her mother did too, she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Both women belong to the Badis, a branch of the despised Hindu caste known as 
the Untouchables. Badi women have traditionally sold their bodies. An estimated 
15,000 to 16,000 members of the subcaste live in Nepal, and 40% of their 
households contain at least one woman engaging in the sex trade, experts say. 
Each sex worker may support up to eight family members. 
</P>
<P>
 With an entire community dependent on prostitution for much, if not most, of 
its income, eliminating Badi women as potential HIV vectors, or carriers, is 
difficult. Handing out more than 7,000 condoms each month to the prostitutes 
and teaching them and customers how to use them with cartoons on a flip chart, 
as the grass-roots Social Awareness for Education (SAFE) does in Nepalganj, is 
just a start. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our purpose is also to supply an alternative profession for the Badi people," 
SAFE leader Dilip Pariyar said. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a mighty, uphill struggle, and one emblematic of the social changes that 
specialists like Tarantola, a garrulous, charming Frenchman who received a 
prestigious Albert Schweitzer Award for his achievements in public health, say 
must be made in tradition-bound Nepalese society if AIDS is not to spread like 
wildfire. 
</P>
<P>
 In this beautiful but impoverished land, where the average annual income is 
$165, the economic lure of prostitution is strong, especially if a woman knows 
no other trade. In many villages, it is assumed that any hut that has a tin 
roof instead of a thatch one houses a prostitute who can afford the more 
expensive covering. 
</P>
<P>
 Many Nepalese, reared in the traditional Hindu value system that regards each 
caste as fit for only one type of labor, have a difficult time imagining Badi 
women engaged in anything but sex for hire. That is one reason that SAFE has 
opened a hostel in Nepalganj for 22 Badi girls, ages 8 to 17. 
</P>
<P>
 The youngsters, freshly scrubbed and wearing white smocks, used to live at 
home, but relatives who wanted to act as their pimps -- as well as hopeful 
clients -- wouldn't stop soliciting them, Pariyar said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Badis represent only a single aspect, albeit a unique one, of the 
challenges facing Nepalese and foreign organizations wrestling with the AIDS 
crisis here. By some estimates, a staggering 200,000 Nepali women are employed 
in brothels in India. Some went willingly, while others were duped by brokers 
who bought them from their parents. 
</P>
<P>
 This Indian sex trade may represent the greatest potential AIDS carrier of 
all. In Bombay, where an estimated 60,000 Nepalese women toil in the brothels, 
nearly 45% of prostitutes have tested HIV-positive. 
</P>
<P>
 What will happen when these Nepali women return home, often to isolated 
mountain hamlets where there is no AIDS testing? And what of their clients? An 
estimated 90,000 Nepalese men work in Bombay, and a fact-finding mission this 
year by Nepalese women's organizations to 50 Indian brothels found that a 
Nepalese prostitute, on average, "entertained" four or five countrymen every 
day. 
</P>
<P>
 "These men then come home to their wives and families," said Dr. Renu 
Rajbhandari, executive director of the Women's Rehabilitation Center in 
Katmandu, the capital. "And we don't know how much HIV they are bringing back." 
</P>
<P>
 The cross-border trade in prostitutes, most of whom are taken to India when 
they are 12 or 13 and treated as sex slaves, could have devastating 
consequences for the Tamangs and other hill tribes of central Nepal, whose 
women and girls are particularly prized by men in India and other parts of 
Nepal for their docility and gentleness. 
</P>
<P>
 "From Nuwakot, the girls go because they need money. They don't have anything 
else," Rajbhandari said. In the villages of another central district, "you 
can't find a young woman," she added. "They are all in Bombay." 
</P>
<P>
 To minimize the women's risk of contracting HIV or venereal disease, the 
Women's Rehabilitation Center has hired half a dozen Bombay prostitutes to work 
as "peer counselors" in the brothels, responsible for explaining the hows and 
whys of AIDS and condoms, which many Nepalese have never seen. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can't say, 'Don't do prostitution,' " Rajbhandari said. "This is not our 
right. We say, 'Have safer sex.' " 
</P>
<P>
 But with as many as an estimated 90% of the girls from some villages in 
Sindhupalchok, north of Katmandu, engaging in prostitution, the Women's 
Rehabilitation Center is also trying to promote alternative income projects, 
like bamboo crafts, to break the economic logic that causes many women to opt 
for or be ensnared in the sex business. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they can earn 700 rupees (about $15) per month, they won't go to Bombay," 
Rajbhandari said. 
</P>
<P>
 At WRC headquarters, 15 girls and young women make a living knitting sweaters, 
which a middleman buys for $5 apiece for shipment to Germany. One star knitter 
is Gita, 28, who was sold into prostitution by her cousin, but who had to 
return to Nepal from Bombay when a blood test showed she is HIV-positive. Now 
sometimes brooding and temperamental, Gita says she has a lover and wants to 
get married. 
</P>
<P>
 As in sub-Saharan African countries, poverty is a contributing factor to the 
spread of AIDS here. Dr. Benu B. Karki is chief of the Nepalese government's 
National AIDS Prevention and Control Project. He has a staff of 15 and an 
annual budget of $300,000 for a nation of about 20 million people. 
</P>
<P>
 "Raising awareness is the only strategy that we have in the AIDS program," the 
harried doctor said. "I don't have any regional, district or village staff." 
</P>
<P>
 Nepal's conservative Hindu mores also complicate the anti-AIDS campaign: 
Outside of marriage, people generally don't talk about sex. A woman is not 
deemed a man's equal and has little or no control over her sex life. 
</P>
<P>
 And in a country where 74% of adults are illiterate, prudery and ignorance 
seem to reinforce themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you want to examine a person's private parts, either they refuse, or they 
leave the doctor's office," Karki said. "We really don't find out about some 
people (AIDS victims) until they die." 
</P>
<P>
 The first AIDS case in Nepal was diagnosed in July, 1988. Today, Health 
Ministry statistics say 100 men and 102 women have been found to be 
HIV-positive. Thirty of them have developed AIDS, and 15 have died. 
</P>
<P>
 Extrapolating from those numbers, the ministry estimates there are 6,000 HIV 
carriers in the country. But Karki admitted, "We really don't know the 
situation." 
</P>
<P>
 Other potential AIDS carriers include about 350,000 Nepalese who head to India 
each year in search of work. "They are uneducated and don't even know what a 
condom is," Karki said. In the other direction, an estimated 2 million truck 
drivers, farm workers and other Indians flock annually to Nepal, where they 
often patronize prostitutes. 
</P>
<P>
 To supplement the government's modest anti-AIDS effort, a number of local and 
foreign charities and nonprofit organizations have stepped in. AmFAR, the 
American Foundation for AIDS Research chaired by actress Elizabeth Taylor, 
began funding 17 prevention programs in Nepal in October and says it will pump 
more than $600,000 in grants and technical assistance into the country annually 
for three years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our strategy is to go to countries with low incidence of HIV, but where there 
is danger of rapid growth," said the Rev. Margaret R. Reinfeld, an Episcopal 
priest who is AmFAR's director of education and international programs. "We try 
to encourage community responses in ways appropriate for those countries, and 
not import ready-made solutions." 
</P>
<P>
 This has taken the anti-AIDS message in some strange directions that do not 
always meet with full approval from the American donors. This summer, members 
of an AmFAR delegation cringed as one of Nepal's oldest social-service 
organizations, Agroforestry, Basic Health & Cooperatives Nepal, distributed 
brochures at a Bhaktapur elementary school that were intended to inform 
children about AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 The leaflets contained graphic, colorful photographs of sores and other 
symptoms. Although the youngsters eagerly scrutinized the pictures and listened 
politely to the teacher, some clearly didn't understand the significance of the 
lesson. 
</P>
<P>
 "But why do we need a sexual partner?" one asked. 
</P>
<P>
 Funded wholly or in part by AmFAR, social workers now cruise Katmandu's "Freak 
Street," a rendezvous made famous by Western hippies of the 1960s, and exchange 
needles used by some of Nepal's officially estimated 25,000 intravenous drug 
users, most of whom shoot low-grade heroin. At the country's biggest cracker 
factory, a traveling lecture session and burlesque street show in June told 
workers and neighbors about AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 There was even a how-to lesson on condoms that erupted into general hilarity 
when a hapless male assistant inadvertently launched the condom into the air. 
</P>
<P>
 In Nepal, the anti-AIDS message is being preached by community organizations 
that, in addition, promote growing leafy green vegetables to reduce Vitamin A 
deficiency, goat husbandry as a means to financial independence and the buying 
up of land to distribute to impoverished tribes or castes. 
</P>
<P>
 There seems to be a clear danger that information about AIDS will be drowned 
out by other items on the agenda. But Tarantola insists that this 
community-based approach is the only effective strategy. And though some 
anti-AIDS measures may seem to have little in common with, say, the activities 
of the Gay Men's Health Crisis, the root logic, Tarantola said, is identical. 
</P>
<P>
 "I suggest that wherever discrimination exists . . . this is probably where 
the highest vulnerability for HIV is," said Tarantola, scientific editor of the 
voluminous "AIDS in the World" study. "You can correlate marginalization with 
vulnerability." 
</P>
<P>
 In Nepal, "marginalization" means the situation of groups like the Badi. It is 
too early to foretell the fate of Amarwati and her neighbors. One recent study 
found that 70% of Badi sex workers suffered from syphilis and other sexually 
transmitted diseases, but HIV apparently has not yet made significant inroads. 
</P>
<P>
 So perhaps the Daliesque landscape of castaway condoms in Nepalganj's Badi 
ghetto is a sign of hope. As a result of advice from SAFE's health workers, 
Amarwati says, for the past 12 months she has insisted that her clients use a 
condom. If necessary, she can provide one. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they use a condom, they get it," the Badi woman said matter-of-factly. "If 
they don't, they don't. It's my health."

CLINTON REQUESTS FUNDS FOR EARTHQUAKE REPAIRS; AID: PRESIDENT ASKS CONGRESS TO 
OK $225 MILLION, MAINLY FOR ABANDONED HOUSING IN VALLEY, SANTA MONICA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Responding to a shortage of money for restoring quake-damaged housing, 
President Clinton asked the U.S. Congress on Tuesday to free up $225 million 
for the cities of Los Angeles and Santa Monica to issue as repair loans, 
particularly to those vacant, crime-infested enclaves known as "ghost towns." 
</P>
<P>
 The funding, which was leftover aid from highway and school repair programs, 
would provide zero-interest loans to hundreds of owners of wrecked apartment 
buildings and condominiums who find they are unable to get loans through banks 
or other federal aid programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles city housing officials lauded the announcement, saying it will 
nearly make up for a shortfall in the money needed to repair the more than 
50,000 apartments, condos and single-family houses that were severely damaged 
in the Jan. 17 quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking to Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan and Santa Monica Mayor Judy Abdo 
by telephone from Washington, Clinton called the money a "down payment on our 
partnership with the cities to solve this ghost town problem." 
</P>
<P>
 "This goes beyond a typical federal disaster response, and it's possible 
because we have been able to reallocate some other disaster funds," he told the 
mayors and Housing Secretary Henry Cisneros and U.S. Sen. Diane Feinstein, who 
were also on the line from Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 If approved by Congress, as expected, Los Angeles housing officials will get 
$200 million of the total, while Santa Monica -- which lost 5% of its housing 
stock in the disaster -- will receive the $25 million balance, most of which it 
will also reserve for multiunit buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 The money is the latest of $11.9 billion in federal quake relief set aside by 
Clinton and Congress for quake victims in Southern California, a total that 
surpasses federal aid to all other recent disasters combined. 
</P>
<P>
 The President took advantage of the telephone conference call -- and the media 
attention it had attracted -- to mention a glowing report on federal assistance 
efforts during the first six months after the 6.8-magnitude quake. 
</P>
<P>
 "At every opportunity, federal agencies responded with speed, flexibility and 
creativity to meet the needs of earthquake victims," according to the report, 
drafted by the federal Office of Management and Budget. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan said he requested the housing loans from Clinton last week after 
learning that an estimated $400-million surplus in federal funds set aside for 
repairing quake damage to freeways and schools was available for other uses. 
</P>
<P>
 The mayor said the money is to be funneled to multiunit housing repair loans 
because that was where city housing officials had identified a large gap 
between need and funds. 
</P>
<P>
 "This will give us the flexibility to use the money where it is needed," 
Riordan told Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 Money previously allocated by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the 
Small Business Administration and private insurance companies is expected to 
finance repairs of about 30,000 of the 50,000 severely damaged dwelling units 
in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 City housing officials already had secured $110 million in funding from other 
federal and local sources, enough to repair another 5,000 units. But that left 
the owners of the remaining 15,000 or so units without any help, or hope. 
</P>
<P>
 The money Clinton requested Tuesday is expected to repair most of those 
remaining units, said Gary Squier, general manager of Los Angeles' city housing 
department. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the most part, these resources will take care of the bulk of the 
(remaining) damage," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Particularly troubling for those housing officials trying to restore the 
city's damaged housing stock was the evolution of the ghost towns, clusters of 
vacant, damaged buildings that became infested with vagrants, scavengers, drug 
dealers, gang members and prostitutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors and city officials feared that the crime in those buildings would 
spread to nearby neighborhoods, and in some cases it quickly did. 
</P>
<P>
 The city has launched an aggressive attack plan against ghost towns that 
includes police sweeps followed by crews boarding up and fencing off vacant 
buildings. In the latest salvo, the city has hired round-the-clock security 
guards to keep trespassers out of the 12 ghost towns identified in the San 
Fernando Valley, Hollywood and the Mid-City area. 
</P>
<P>
 The bulk of the money requested Tuesday will be available to owners within the 
ghost towns, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 After the phone conference with Clinton, Councilman Richard Alarcon, whose 
northeast Valley district includes two ghost towns, said that the money "could 
not have come at a better time." 
</P>
<P>
 "This money, if approved by Congress, will make it possible for the city to 
deal with one of our biggest problems -- the ghost town buildings -- which 
still represent a hazard to the community." 
</P>
<P>
 Another important aspect of the funding request is that the owners of 
condominium units, which received an estimated $107-million damage in the 
quake, will have greater access to federal funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal housing regulations make it difficult for condo owners to qualify for 
federal loan programs, and "they fell through the cracks," according to an aide 
for Rep. Howard L. Berman (D-Panorama City), who brought the problem to the 
attention of the Office of Management and Budget. 
</P>
<P>
 Squier said the money will be loaned out on a first-come, first-served basis. 
But because condominium financing is complicated by the presence of condo 
associations, he said an as-yet undetermined portion of the funding will be set 
aside just for condo repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Apartment and condominium owners in Los Angeles can begin to apply for the 
loans immediately from the city's housing department by calling (800) 994-4444. 
The loans will be limited to $35,000 per unit, and the federal funding rules 
require that 20% of the repaired units be set aside for affordable housing.

FIRST INTERSTATE WILL BUY BANK OF A. LEVY; MERGER: THE PURCHASE FOR $86.5 
MILLION WILL CREATE VENTURA COUNTY'S SECOND LARGEST FINANCIAL INSTITUTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The 112-year-old Bank of A. Levy, Ventura County's largest locally owned bank, 
is being sold to Los Angeles-based First Interstate Bancorp, officials 
announced Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 First Interstate, which has aggressively bought smaller banks in the past 1 
1/2 years, will pay $86.5 million in stock for Levy Bancorp, Bank of A. Levy's 
parent company. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura-based Bank of A. Levy has 17 branches throughout the county, some of 
which may close along with some of First Interstate's eight local branches, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 First Interstate said it wants to boost its presence in Ventura County, 
projecting a county growth rate of 3.2% through the 1990s and an average 
household income about 10% higher than the state's average. 
</P>
<P>
 "This acquisition . . . offers us an outstanding opportunity to expand our 
position in one of the state's fastest-growing markets," First Interstate Chief 
Executive Bruce G. Willison said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bank of A. Levy's president, Marshall Milligan, a great-grandson of founder 
Achille Levy, said the decision to sell was spurred by a trend toward 
consolidation in the banking industry. 
</P>
<P>
 "We felt we should be involved sooner rather than later," Milligan said. "If 
we were going to sell, we wanted to do so at a time when there were a number of 
healthy buyers available." 
</P>
<P>
 He also cited increasing difficulties of competing with vast corporate banks. 
"We see the trend in the industry not favoring smaller banks," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The sale was a bittersweet closing to the bank's long history, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very much a case of mixed emotions," Milligan said. "This is the final 
chapter in a long story full of history and tradition, so we're sad to see it 
end. Yet we believe the transaction makes good sense for all the shareholders." 
</P>
<P>
 The bank was founded by Levy, a French immigrant and dry-goods merchant. About 
61% of Bank of A. Levy stock is held by his descendants. 
</P>
<P>
 The announcement was met with cries of dismay from community leaders and 
longtime customers who consider the financial institution as much a part of 
Ventura County as the strawberry fields of the Oxnard Plain. 
</P>
<P>
 "In some ways, the Bank of A. Levy could be deemed the founder of Oxnard," 
Oxnard Mayor Manuel Lopez said. "It really financed a lot of the early 
development. The bank was the lifeblood of the city." 
</P>
<P>
 The merger of the two banks, expected to be completed during the first quarter 
of 1995, leaves 276 employees of Bank of A. Levy in limbo. 
</P>
<P>
 "As you can imagine, with any merger, there are some duplicative jobs," said 
David Garcia, a vice president at First Interstate. "We expect that some job 
reductions will occur at both banks." 
</P>
<P>
 The deal marks First Interstate's second purchase in Ventura County this year. 
In January, it completed the $23-million acquisition of First State Bank of the 
Oaks, a five-branch bank headquartered in Thousand Oaks. All but one of Bank of 
the Oaks' branches have since closed. 
</P>
<P>
 The merger will make First Interstate the second-largest financial institution 
in Ventura County, behind Bank of America. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County National Bank will become the largest locally owned bank. But 
last month, its owners announced negotiations for a possible sale. 
</P>
<P>
 Bank of A. Levy, with assets of $625 million, has recently begun to emerge 
from two years of financial troubles that culminated in July, 1993, when the 
bank signed an administrative order with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. 
The order required the bank to improve its loan portfolio and get FDIC approval 
for any new directors or senior officers. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the first and second quarters of 1994, Bank of A. Levy showed its first 
profits in nearly two years. 
</P>
<P>
 "We could not have put together a sale a year ago," Milligan said. "The window 
of opportunity just opened within the last six months." 
</P>
<P>
 First Interstate paid a premium price for the bank, 1.84 times its book value 
of $47 million, officials of both banks said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I regard it as a very favorable price," Milligan said. "It is the 
second-highest price paid in California in two years for a bank." 
</P>
<P>
 Negotiations for the sale began about two weeks ago, he said, adding that Bank 
of A. Levy solicited the purchase. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the sale agreement, Milligan, 43, will not be hired by First Interstate 
and is prohibited from working at any bank in Ventura or Santa Barbara counties 
for three years. 
</P>
<P>
 Milligan said the bank's goal of providing a personal and local touch in 
banking had become increasingly complicated. While some customers prize that 
local identity, they also demand faster, more efficient services that are more 
easily provided by large competitors. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a significant segment of the population that likes the local 
identity and local feel of an independent bank," Milligan said. "Unfortunately, 
they often aren't willing to pay for that service." 
</P>
<P>
 But for Thousand Oaks customer Michael Surwin, service is the reason he has 
been banking at Bank of A. Levy for 10 years. He said he was disappointed to 
learn of the sale, predicting that service will not be the same with a large 
bank. 
</P>
<P>
 "I won't stay with First Interstate," Surwin said. "I'm really upset with all 
these mergers." 
</P>
<P>
 Suzanne Sonntag of Ventura saw the acquisition as inevitable. "Merging and 
buying and selling is part of our society today," she said. "It's progress in 
its own way."

 BIG IS BETTER? For years, the Bank of A. Levy has promoted itself as a local 
bank that cares more about its customers than bigger competitors. On Tuesday, 
the family owners announced they sold the bank to First Interstate for $86.5 
million (A1). . . . It's not the first offer to come along since Achille Levy 
founded the bank in 1882. In 1940, Bank of America was willing to pay any 
reasonable price. But Achille's son, Joe, refused to sell, according to the 
bank's official history, which noted: "The bank remained a local institution. 
Perhaps Joe never even considered selling out."

 RESTLESS BONES: Ancestors of pygmy mammoths that once roamed the Channel 
Islands swam the channel sometime during the Ice Age. Or so scientists 
speculate. . . . Now, the bones of a pygmy mammoth skeleton will make the trip 
back (B1). National Park officials have yet to settle on a home for the bones. 
They hope to erect a replica at park headquarters in Ventura. But the fossil 
may go to a museum elsewhere. "It needs to be kept in a museum," said park 
spokeswoman Carol Spears. "We're not equipped to have it here." 
</P>
<P>
 PROUD PERCH: What eats 650 pounds of birdseed every month? The Steckel Park 
aviary near Santa Paula. . . . Officials say the sanctuary for 200 unwanted 
birds has a conscientious caretaker and now attracts gaggles of visitors daily 
(B1). "It was a grand old lady that sort of fell by the wayside," said parks 
official Pam Gallo. "We picked her up and gave her a new set of clothes."

 PARTY ON: Thousand Oaks isn't the only city gearing up for a big bash in 
October. Simi Valley plans to celebrate its 25th anniversary. . . . Simi Valley 
Mayor Greg Stratton said the opening of Thousand Oaks' Civic Arts Plaza will 
not overshadow his city's birthday bash. "I don't know many people in Simi who 
are even aware of the Thousand Oaks event," he said. He worries about Simi 
Valley Days in September. "Hopefully, everyone won't be so pooped from Simi 
Valley Days that they won't be interested in the party."

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / GOVERNOR; WILSON, BROWN ESCALATE BATTLE OVER RAPE AD; 
INCUMBENT AGAIN CRITICIZES CHALLENGER FOR HER STANCE ON A REVISED 'ONE-STRIKE' 
SENTENCING BILL. IN NEW TV ADS, SHE ACCUSES HIM OF EXPLOITING THE PAIN OF 
VICTIMS. 
</P>

<P>
 Republican Gov. Pete Wilson and Democrat Kathleen Brown escalated an 
increasingly bitter dispute over tougher sentences for rapists even though both 
candidates now support the only version of the so-called "one-strike" bill that 
is considered to have any chance of winning approval in the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson held a news conference at Los Angeles County Jail to criticize Brown, 
the state treasurer, for being too slow and too meek in proclaiming her support 
for the revised rape sentencing bill sponsored by state Sen. Marian Bergeson 
(R-Newport Beach). 
</P>
<P>
 "Our ad is fair," Wilson said in defense of his anti-Brown television 
commercial that Brown has denounced as a lie and insisted be removed from the 
air. "It is accurate. And it reflects the differences in our records supporting 
tougher laws for rapists and other violent thugs." 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, Brown was going on television with two new ads that accuse 
Wilson of lying about her position and of "exploiting the pain of rape victims 
to cover up his failed record." 
</P>
<P>
 "As a woman in California," Brown asks the television audience, "do you feel 
safer today than you did four years ago?" 
</P>
<P>
 Brown won support from half a dozen representatives of women's groups who 
called a news conference Tuesday to "speak out against Pete Wilson's use of an 
irresponsible version of the 'one strike and you're out' bill for rape in his 
campaign." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown campaign strategists concede that Wilson, as a Republican male with a 
long record of being tough on crime, has an inherent advantage on the general 
issue of crime. But they hope to blunt that advantage by attacking specific 
aspects of his record. Campaign experts say it is difficult or impossible for a 
male candidate to better a woman candidate on the issue of rape, for example. 
</P>
<P>
 The exchange grew out of an ongoing Brown attack on Wilson over another 
element of the crime issue -- her allegation that relaxed parole policies under 
Wilson have improperly allowed dangerous criminals back onto the streets to 
rob, rape and kill. Wilson responded July 26 with an ad accusing Brown of false 
attacks. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, Wilson released his latest ad, which said Brown opposed his 
original "one-strike" bill to put all convicted rapists in prison for life 
without possibility of parole. The ad implied that Brown opposed any 
"one-strike" bill, even after it was amended to provide a maximum term of 25 
years to life with the possibility of parole. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown called that a lie and said she had endorsed the amended bill. She 
demanded that he pull the ad from the air. Wilson refused. On Tuesday, he 
called the news conference at the jail with Bergeson to say that "there was 
absolutely no public record that she ever supported even the compromise 
version." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Brown aides told reporters July 18 that she supported the amended 
version of the bill. No major newspapers apparently felt the comment was worthy 
of a story, thus allowing Wilson to contend that "no public record" of her 
support existed. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson has said he would sign the revised Bergeson bill into law if it passes 
this year as an interim step. But he added that he would continue to fight for 
a true "one-strike" law that would send any convicted rapist to prison for life 
without parole. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown and others opposed the sentence of life without parole as impractical, 
saying that it would make it impossible to win convictions in many rape cases. 
Democrats accused Wilson of pushing the bill as a campaign ploy, knowing that 
it has virtually no chance of winning approval in the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
 Crime -- including tougher sentences for rapists -- was a cornerstone of 
Wilson's first campaign for governor against Democrat Dianne Feinstein in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 When he opened his 1990 campaign on Labor Day, then-U.S. Sen. Wilson vowed: 
"This state will not be under siege to rapists or thugs or sellers of crack 
cocaine." 
</P>
<P>
 However, Wilson had little success with that issue against Feinstein, who had 
developed a record as a tough crime fighter as mayor of San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, Wilson has focused on the crime issue against Brown, who did not 
face many crime matters in her two elective jobs to date, as a member of the 
Los Angeles Unified School District Board of Education and state treasurer. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson in particular has attacked Brown for her personal opposition to the 
death penalty although she has pledged to enforce the death penalty law. His 
July 26 ad striking back at her on the parole issue noted that "Brown is 
strongly against the death penalty." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown's latest ads all contain some version of this litany: "I support the 
'one-strike' law against rapists, 'three-strikes' law against felons, and as 
governor, I will enforce the death penalty." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson did not have the death penalty as an issue in 1990 since Feinstein was 
a strong advocate of executions. But Brown has an advantage over Feinstein 
because Wilson has been in office for nearly four years and failed to win many 
of the tougher sentences that he talked about in the 1990 campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990, Wilson put most of the blame on Democratic Assembly Speaker Willie 
Brown of San Francisco for appointing committees that had thwarted tougher 
anti-crime bills. This time, Wilson is not heaping scorn on Speaker Brown, who 
has been a valuable Wilson ally on a number of critical issues.

PROBLEMS UNDERCUT CLAS TESTS, PANEL SAYS; EDUCATION: STATISTICS EXPERTS SAY 
SAMPLING AND SCORING PROCEDURES NEED TO BE IMPROVED, AND RECOMMEND THAT AN 
OUTSIDE FIRM BE HIRED TO ADMINISTER THE EXAMS. BUT THEY PRAISE PROGRAM FOR 
INNOVATION. 
</P>

 Budget constraints, scoring glitches and the difficulties inherent in such a 
complex new testing system have undercut the pioneering California Learning 
Assessment System exams, a panel reviewing the CLAS tests' first rocky year has 
concluded. 
</P>
<P>
 Included in the panel's 62-page report, to be released today, was a 
recommendation that the state Department of Education hire an outside firm to 
administer the tests. The group also called for the department to turn over 
responsibility for scoring and interpretation of the results to a statistics 
expert and to hire a full-time technical coordinator to oversee the effort. 
</P>
<P>
 The panel also cautioned against releasing individual student scores, 
scheduled to begin this year, until the bugs are worked out and parents and 
teachers are thoroughly briefed on how to interpret the results. The governor's 
office has been pushing for individual results so parents and teachers can 
gauge students' progress. 
</P>
<P>
 The exams, intended to pinpoint a school's academic strengths and weaknesses 
by assessing how well students can think and write about what they have 
learned, were given for the first time last year to about 1 million public 
school students in fourth, eighth and 10th grades. To save money, the 
department decided to score only some of the exams in reading, writing and 
mathematics before releasing results for each school. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost immediately, questions surfaced about the accuracy of the scores, which 
were widely published and used by parents and others to evaluate schools. A 
Times analysis showed samples in some cases were so small that results for an 
entire school were based on a handful of graded test booklets. 
</P>
<P>
 The panel of three statistical experts, appointed by the department in April 
to review its scoring procedures, found that there were serious shortfalls in 
the numbers of 1993 exams graded in about 250, or 3%, of schools. In those 
cases, additional exams were scored and results adjusted, the Department of 
Education said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the experts, headed by Lee J. Cronbach of Stanford University, concluded 
that "few school-level reports in 1993 had adequate reliability." 
</P>
<P>
 CLAS developers "made unreasonably optimistic estimates as to the accuracy 
that the resulting school reports would have," Cronbach wrote in a letter 
accompanying the report. 
</P>
<P>
 Problems inherent in the sampling procedures were compounded by lost test 
booklets, errors matching student identification sheets to the booklets, 
mistakes by the contractors helping administer and score the tests, and the 
rush to get scoring done and results released before the 1994 round of testing 
began in the spring. 
</P>
<P>
 "Inadequate review under time pressure led to the release of some reports that 
were manifestly untrustworthy," Cronbach added. 
</P>
<P>
 To make matters worse, many parents and school staffs had expected all the 
tests to be graded, the report noted. 
</P>
<P>
 "CLAS laid a trap for itself when, in the public information packet intended 
to develop understanding of the system, it omitted mention of its intent to 
score only a fraction of booklets," the report said. 
</P>
<P>
 The panel recommended careful tracking of student participation in the 1994 
test, noting that parent protests over test content resulted in widespread 
boycotting at some schools and may have skewed the results. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the panel was assigned to look primarily at the sampling procedures, 
it also noted difficulties in scoring the open-ended, or "performance-based" 
questions that are the hallmark of CLAS and other pioneering testing systems 
around the country. Instead of merely selecting the correct answer from a list 
of possibilities, students are being asked to solve math problems and explain 
their methods or read a passage from literature and write about their 
responses. 
</P>
<P>
 But the panel, which also included Norman M. Bradburn of the University of 
Chicago and Daniel G. Horvitz of the National Institutes for the Statistical 
Sciences, commended CLAS officials for some of their work. 
</P>
<P>
 "CLAS and its contractors have embarked on an unprecedented and imaginative 
project . . . and they have done many things well," Cronbach wrote, adding the 
1993 efforts were "highly successful as a trial" and shed valuable light on 
many aspects of the just-emerging field of performance-based assessment. 
</P>
<P>
 "All the shortcomings of CLAS 1993 can be remedied, within the inexorable 
limits of the time available for testing and the costs of scoring," Cronbach 
added. "CLAS, as it matures, should be able to deliver a highly useful 
product." 
</P>
<P>
 Acting state Supt. of Public Instruction William D. Dawson said he welcomed 
the report and has already acted on some of its recommendations. Scoring of 
this year's tests, done by specially trained teachers at sites around the 
state, already is under way and reflects the panel's suggestions, Dawson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The report comes as CLAS, which is also under attack from religious 
conservatives for the contents of its reading and writing tests, faces an 
uncertain future. Next week, legislators are scheduled to work on a compromise 
bill that would continue the system -- renamed the California Comprehensive 
Testing Program in state budget sessions this summer -- while addressing many 
of the criticisms. 
</P>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson's education adviser, Maureen DiMarco, who has been critical 
of the way the testing has been developed and carried out, said the report "not 
only validates our concerns and the concerns of others but also gives us even 
greater impetus to continue to work to revise the assessment system." 
</P>
<P>
 The governor's insistence on individual scores could be met by adding more 
traditional, skills-measuring methods, such as multiple-choice questions, she 
added, noting some of the revisions sought by her boss and other CLAS critics 
already have been added to the proposed legislation.

BLACKS DOMINATE POSTAL SERVICE, LATINO CHARGES; JOBS: TIRSO DEL JUNCO, HEAD OF 
AGENCY'S BOARD OF GOVERNORS, SAYS MANAGEMENT "MUST OPEN THE DOORS OF 
OPPORTUNITY TO EVERYONE." SPOKESMEN SAY HIRING IS COLORBLIND AND BASED ON TEST 
SCORES.

<P>
 The vice chairman of the U.S. Postal Service Board of Governors said Tuesday 
that blacks are overrepresented among postal workers in Los Angeles and other 
major cities, often at the expense of Latinos. 
</P>
<P>
 Postal Service management in Los Angeles, Chicago and Miami "is driven by 
blacks -- they must open the doors of opportunity to everyone," said Dr. Tirso 
del Junco, the vice chairman of the postal board and the chairman of the 
California Republican Party. 
</P>
<P>
 Del Junco said he is trying to get more jobs for Latinos because postal jobs 
are among the best jobs in the country. In Los Angeles, 15% of the postal 
workers are Latino in a city where 34.7% of the work force is Latino, while 
black employees account for 62% of the postal workers and are 9.6% of the local 
labor force. 
</P>
<P>
 Del Junco, a Los Angeles surgeon, raised the issue while the board was 
discussing a report on efforts to increase diversity in the Postal Service work 
force. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview after the meeting, Del Junco complained that he has questioned 
Latino underrepresentation before, but has been ignored during his six years on 
the board. "Not many board members are familiar with it -- I am because I am 
Hispanic and I live in California," said Del Junco, who was first appointed in 
July, 1988. The nine-member board is the governing body of the Postal Service, 
comparable to the board of directors of a private corporation. They select the 
postmaster general. 
</P>
<P>
 "The black leadership in the major cities who are driving the system must 
accept responsibility for bringing equality into the system," he said, 
indicating that he was referring to the local executives in the Postal Service. 
Del Junco also said "there is a very large underrepresentation of white men and 
women in many cities." 
</P>
<P>
 Postal Service officials disputed Del Junco's comments, and said hiring is 
done in strict accordance with the results of a test open to anyone. The 
agency's hiring practices are colorblind and not designed to help or hurt any 
minority, the officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The managers do not control the hiring of employees -- the register controls 
it," said Charly Amos, the Postal Service manager for affirmative action, 
referring to the official list of those who have passed the periodic entrance 
exams. "It would be totally illegal to go off the register" in hiring new 
workers, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The only preference is given to veterans, who get 5 points added to their exam 
score, and disabled veterans get 10 extra points and are automatically moved to 
the top of the list, according to Amos. A score between 70 and 100 puts a 
candidate on the register, with those with the highest scores hired first. (The 
highest possible score would be 110 for a disabled veteran.) Candidates must be 
at least 18 years old, U.S. citizens or permanent resident aliens and have no 
felony criminal record. 
</P>
<P>
 Amos said black workers historically have a "good network" of keeping informed 
about Postal Service tests. 
</P>
<P>
 Del Junco's comments underscore the intense feelings that surround the issue 
of access to postal jobs, which offer desirable and secure positions, 
particularly attractive in California's sluggish economy. 
</P>
<P>
 The Postal Service is the nation's largest civilian employer, with 778,000 
workers, including 720,000 full-time, permanent workers. And the pay is good, 
with an average annual salary of $32,458 for career workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Historically, the Postal Service has been an important source of employment 
for black workers at a time when discrimination blocked them from many jobs and 
professions. 
</P>
<P>
 Blacks are employed in "great numbers in Chicago, Los Angeles and New York 
because the attractiveness of the Postal Service was very great when they had 
lower-paying jobs," Amos said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Postal Service wants to have a work force reflecting the local community, 
something "that will not happen overnight," Amos said. 
</P>
<P>
 Postal Service figures showed that blacks and Asian Americans have a higher 
share of postal jobs in comparison with their share of the total civilian work 
force. 
</P>
<P>
 On a nationwide basis, among all groups, white men account for 46.2% of Postal 
Service workers, compared with 42.6% of the civilian labor force, while white 
women are 21.4% of postal workers and 35.3% of the work force. Black men 
account for 11.4% of postal jobs, and 4.9% of the civilian labor force, while 
black women hold 9.4% of the postal jobs, and make up 5.4% of the total work 
force. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Latinos, men have 4.6% of all postal jobs, and are 4.8% of all workers. 
Latino women are 1.8% of the postal work force and 3.3% of total workers. Asian 
American men have 3.1% of postal jobs, and are 1.5% of all workers. Asian 
American women have 1.7% of jobs, and are 1.3% of all workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the national averages -- which for Latino men are close to their 
numbers in the work force -- Del Junco said the Postal Service hiring of 
Latinos should reflect the local work force. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout California, in such cities as Sacramento, San Bernardino, and 
Riverside as well as Los Angeles, Latinos are under-represented at post 
offices, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Postal Service figures for the Los Angeles district presented at Tuesday's 
board meeting showed white men as 5.6% of the postal work force and 24.9% of 
the civilian labor force; white women had 1.7% of postal jobs and 19.8% of the 
total work force. Black men were 29.4% of postal workers and were 4.7% of all 
civilian workers; black women held 32.6% of postal jobs, and make up 4.9% of 
the labor force. 
</P>
<P>
 Latino men held 10.7% of postal jobs and made up 21.1% of the work force, 
while Latino women held 4.3% of jobs and were 13.6% of the work force. Asian 
American men held 10.5% of postal jobs and were 5.6% of the work force. Asian 
women held 4.9% of postal positions and were 4.8% of the work force.

 Bureaucratic bungling and abuse by the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization 
Service have resulted in tens of thousands of political asylum applicants 
wrongfully not receiving work permits, according to a federal class-action 
lawsuit filed Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Court papers allege that a top INS official acknowledged in a meeting last 
week that about 60,000 political asylum applications had never been entered in 
the agency's computer database and were effectively "lost out in space." 
Frustrated asylum-seekers, the suit alleges, are often bounced from one INS 
office to another, only to be told their files cannot be found. 
</P>

 Through abuse and incompetence, more than 100,000 people -- mostly residing in 
Southern California -- may have ultimately been deprived of working papers, 
says the American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California, one of seven 
civil rights groups filing Tuesday's action in U.S. District Court in Los 
Angeles. Many affected applications date from the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 The nine plaintiffs -- all Central American refugees -- are seeking a federal 
court injunction ordering the government to issue INS work authorizations to 
all legitimate asylum-seekers who have waited longer than the mandated 60- to 
90-day period. 
</P>
<P>
 The job papers are vital to refugees, who are otherwise ineligible for work as 
their applications for political asylum are processed, which can drag on for 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 Current regulations guarantee the applicants' right to work while they await 
adjudication. But federal law also requires that employers check the 
documentation of all would-be workers. 
</P>
<P>
 The asylum lawsuit was filed a day before a government advisory panel, the 
U.S. Commission on Immigration Reform, is expected to recommend that Congress 
create a nationwide network enabling employers to verify job applicants' 
citizenship or immigration status. Some experts have suggested allowing 
employers to tap into an INS telephone-verification system. But critics say the 
chaotic state of asylum applications in California argues against such a 
notion. 
</P>
<P>
 INS officials, while declining to comment on the lawsuit, defended their 
procedures. But authorities acknowledged delays in the fraud-marred political 
asylum process, now facing an ever-expanding backlog of more than 400,000 
applications nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. law makes political asylum available to foreign nationals who can 
demonstrate a "well-founded fear" of persecution in their homelands based on 
their race, religious or political beliefs or national origin. 
</P>
<P>
 The widespread INS delays in authorizing employment, the suit alleges, 
ultimately force many refugees into difficult choices: destitution, working 
illegally or returning to their homelands, where many say they face dire 
consequences. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I went back home, I'm sure I would be killed," said a 35-year-old 
Guatemalan native identified only as Jose, who wore a green paper mask during a 
Los Angeles news conference. 
</P>
<P>
 A Los Angeles factory worker and father of three, Jose said he concealed his 
identity Tuesday so his employer would not recognize him and possibly fire him. 
He is working without proper papers. Jose, a former accounting teacher in 
Guatemala City who says he fled after guerrillas attempted to recruit his 
students, has been waiting nine months for renewal of his INS work 
authorization.

CUSTODY BATTLE PRECEDED WOMAN'S SLAYING OF DAUGHTERS, SELF; TRAGEDY: TERRI 
ESTERAK APPARENTLY WAS DISTRAUGHT THAT A MONTH WITH HER CHILDREN WAS ENDING. 
RATHER THAN RETURNING THEM TO HER EX-HUSBAND, SHE SHOT THEM AND KILLED HERSELF, 
POLICE SAY.

<P>
 Terri Lynn Esterak was supposed to return her three young daughters to her 
ex-husband at the end of the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 Because she did not have primary custody, she was supposed to return them 
Sunday night to their father, Michael Esterak. After that, her time with her 
daughters was to be structured by a calendar: only on alternate weekends, 
alternate holidays, and Christmas and Easter. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a court order she apparently couldn't accept. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, Esterak booked herself a swank hotel room in Indian Wells. Then 
she murdered Erica, Eden and Erin in their pajamas and killed herself, police 
said, in a scene discovered Monday by a hotel maid and security personnel who 
broke in through the double-locked door. 
</P>
<P>
 Nobody knows what kind of darkness cloaked the 31-year-old woman, what she was 
thinking. 
</P>
<P>
 Her attorney, Sara Wasserstrom, spoke to her client last week as the mother 
was approaching the end of a court-sanctioned, monthlong vacation with her 
girls at her Rancho Mirage home. 
</P>
<P>
 "Terri said she didn't think the kids would want to go back (to their 
father)," Wasserstrom said. "And she didn't want them to go back. That often 
happens in a divorce, at the end of summer vacation." 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney Constance Bessada, who represented the husband in the divorce case, 
was at a loss to explain what happened. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've spoken to about everybody I can think of who was close to this case, 
because we need to do our own soul-searching," Bessada said. "What did we miss? 
We've known them as persons, not just names on a piece of paper. We've seen 
their little fingers move. Those children are being grieved by all of us." 
</P>
<P>
 Bessada said she could only wonder at why it happened. 
</P>
<P>
 "People get obsessed with what they must have," she reflected Tuesday. "I've 
had a client who was subsequently murdered by an abusive husband, and a client 
who committed suicide. But never this, when babies pay. Innocent, beautiful 
children who loved both their parents." 
</P>
<P>
 Strictly as a crime, the multiple murder and suicide at the Hyatt Grand 
Champions Villas was not hard to solve, police said. The girls were found lying 
on the bed, shot to death. Next to their mother's body was a revolver. Suicide 
notes were nearby, but the contents have not been revealed. 
</P>
<P>
 The attorneys who handled the divorce of Terri Lynn Esterak, a onetime 
interior designer, and Michael Esterak, a driver for United Parcel Service, 
said the shootings reflect the darkest side of broken marriages: children as 
pawns. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to somehow find out why this happened so we can try to stop it from 
happening again," Bessada said. "How is it that we can get to the point where 
there's a custody and visitation agreement that satisfies the children's needs, 
and this still happens?" 
</P>
<P>
 The couple were married in 1980. Several years ago, she moved to Rancho Mirage 
to be closer to her parents. Because of his job, Michael Esterak stayed in the 
Los Angeles area -- in North Hollywood for a time, then Northridge until the 
earthquake dislocated him. He made the 2 1/2-hour drive to Rancho Mirage on 
weekends to visit his family. 
</P>
<P>
 At some point last year, he learned that his wife had struck up a relationship 
with a restaurant owner, Bessada said. "I don't know if he walked or she kicked 
(him out)," Bessada said, but he filed for divorce last year and moved to Long 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 There was little dispute over property division: She got the Lexus, he kept 
his Ford Bronco, a Toyota pickup and Celica and the stocks and bonds, and each 
kept the furnishings they had when they separated. There would be no spousal 
support. 
</P>
<P>
 But unresolved was the most difficult decision of all: custody of Erica, 9, 
Eden, 4, and Erin, 2, who attorneys for both sides said received the doting 
attention and love of both mother and father. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge listened to the advice of a family therapist and an evaluator who 
met with the children, reflected on the children's stability and awarded 
primary custody to Michael. It didn't help her case, the judge noted, that 
Terri Lynn Esterak went on vacation with her boyfriend to Europe last fall and 
allowed her ex-husband to watch the girls. 
</P>
<P>
 Terri Lynn Esterak complained in court papers that her ex-husband had 
physically abused her in front of the girls; Michael Esterak said it was his 
wife who physically attacked him in front of the girls. He blamed cocaine for 
her behavior. In court papers, his new girlfriend said Terri Lynn Esterak was 
verbally abusive to her. Each ex-spouse sought restraining orders to force the 
other to keep a distance. 
</P>
<P>
 Wasserstrom grew anxious when she learned Monday morning that Terri Lynn 
Esterak had not shown up to deliver the girls to their father. "This is 
heart-wrenching," Wasserstrom said. "They were adorable little kids." 
</P>
<P>
 Bessada said she had considered Terri Lynn Esterak "high-strung" and driven, 
but never was concerned about the children's safety. 
</P>
<P>
 "These beautiful little beings never belonged in a courthouse to begin with, 
but they kept having to show up," she said. "What the system needs, I don't 
know, but something's not working."

 Full diplomatic ties with Washington and a modern nuclear reactor are North 
Korea's conditions for letting inspectors monitor its nuclear program, 
according to the government's Rodong Shinmun newspaper. The paper said U.S. 
response to the demands, to be set Friday when talks resume in Geneva, will 
show "whether they are interested in the fundamental solution to the nuclear 
issue in the Korean peninsula or not." U.S. officials reportedly want a 
step-by-step approach that rewards North Korea for progress on nuclear issues.

BRAZIL BEMOANS ITS HOMELESS CHILDREN; LATIN AMERICA: A WEEKEND KILLING 
HIGHLIGHTS NATIONAL CRISIS. ABOUT 200,000 YOUNGSTERS LIVE ON THE STREETS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 In this city where an average of 30 people are shot, stabbed or beaten to 
death daily, murder is commonplace, but this one touched a particularly 
sensitive nerve: 
</P>
<P>
 Jose Carlos Madeira Serrano, 64, the former director of the nation's Central 
Bank and the man once responsible for managing its foreign debt, had been shot 
in the back early Sunday in an attempted carjacking as he was dropping off two 
women at their downtown apartment. 
</P>
<P>
 As much as the victim's celebrity captured public and media attention, the 
description of his assailant -- reportedly a 12-year-old, one of the nation's 
growing number of homeless children -- excited even more notice. 
</P>
<P>
 Underscoring the issues, the high-profile shooting came almost exactly one 
year after an infamous incident in which eight homeless children -- the 
youngest was 8 -- were shot to death by off-duty police officers as they slept 
downtown, across the street from Candelaria Church, a prominent tourist 
attraction. 
</P>
<P>
 Serrano's death focused the public's attention on an unresolved crisis: what 
to do about the growing criminal threat and national embarrassment of children 
who are forced into the streets, many of them preying on the city's 12 million 
residents to survive? 
</P>
<P>
 Police arrested Serrano's suspected killer Tuesday. It turned out that he was 
not 12 but 16; not homeless, but living with his parents and siblings in a 
lower-middle-class apartment on the outskirts of town. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the killing, coming as it did just days after the anniversary of the 
"Candelaria Massacre," has sharpened sentiments regarding a problem that has 
aroused some to take matters in their own hands: They have hired death squads 
to hunt down and kill homeless children. 
</P>
<P>
 Friends and former government officials focused on the issue of the homeless 
children at Serrano's funeral, blaming his death on the inability of government 
officials to address the children's crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't a boy who killed Serrano -- he just pulled the trigger," said Reis 
Velloso, the nation's former minister of planning. "What happened Sunday could 
happen to me tomorrow. The authorities will only finish with this tragic 
situation when the people take to the streets to protest against all this." 
</P>
<P>
 "We live in social crisis," echoed Carlos Brandao, a former president of the 
Central Bank whose brother-in-law was killed four years ago by a 12-year-old in 
Sao Paulo. "We haven't had any economic growth in the past 13 years, and we 
haven't invested in health and education." 
</P>
<P>
 But increasingly, sympathy is shifting away from the children, say 
prosecutors, judges and children's advocates. 
</P>
<P>
 Yvonne Bezerra de Mello, a wealthy artist who daily delivers food and medicine 
to homeless children, said many upper-class Brazilians have never approved of 
her efforts but that, since Sunday, they have been spurred to express 
themselves with unprecedented vehemence. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was in the street giving out food, and people in cars would stop and say, 
'You should have been the one that was killed,' " De Mello said. "People would 
stop and call me a bitch and a whore and say that I'm just protecting a bunch 
of bandits." 
</P>
<P>
 "Unfortunately, the culture of a large portion of our society feels that way," 
said Juvenile Justice Siro Darlan. "They put the guilt on the children, which 
is much easier than assuming the responsibility themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 While in many nations the debate over juvenile justice centers on whether to 
provide more services or more punishment, in Brazil the government position, 
say critics, has been to neglect both ends. 
</P>
<P>
 On the one hand, the country does little to provide for its children, they 
say: Nationally, six of every 100 children will die before the age of 1, and in 
the impoverished northeast region, the figure jumps to 25. More than 7 million 
children never finish grade school. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no foster care system. Consequently, many children who face 
intolerable situations at home drift into the streets; there they turn to 
robbery, theft, prostitution and drug trafficking in order to survive. 
</P>
<P>
 About 200,000 children live on the streets, which often represent liberation 
from despair and abuse at home, says Lauro Monteiro, a pediatrician and 
director of the Brazilian Assn. for the Protection of Infants and Adolescents. 
</P>
<P>
 "Boys go to the street sometimes at 5 or 10 years of age because what exists 
for them is not really a home," Monteiro said. "They have survived the first 
years of life in total abandonment. By 10 or 12 years of age, they've gone 
through an intense education in violence." 
</P>
<P>
 Most beg or sell peanuts or candy, but many are like Leo, 14, who has been 
living on the streets of Rio de Janeiro since he was 8 years old. 
</P>
<P>
 "I steal for a living," said Leo, who claims he was sleeping nearby a year ago 
when his friends were murdered in the Candelaria attack. "We rob the people 
coming out of the banks." 
</P>
<P>
 Death is a constant danger. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know we're going to die soon," said Jorgionho, a 16-year-old street 
dweller. 
</P>
<P>
 Government officials estimate that 6,000 children are murdered annually, twice 
the number in the United States, which has 80 million more residents. Most are 
killed by drug traffickers, the others by death squads. 
</P>
<P>
 When juveniles commit crimes, they face extremely light sentences. The maximum 
penalty for any juvenile offender is three years, no matter the offense. That 
has allowed street children to prey on the public with near impunity. It also 
has made them ideal tools for adult criminals. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's frustrating," said Eleio Gunther, a police chief investigating Serrano's 
killing, "but it's the law." 
</P>
<P>
 Darlan, the juvenile judge, says the leniency is a logical extension of the 
nation's neglect of its juvenile population. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you do not give anything to your citizens -- education, homes, good health 
care -- you cannot ask for much in return. In America, you give children 
education, health care and other things, so you expect something out of them. 
Here, nothing is given to the children, so how can you really demand anything 
of them?"

OPPOSITION REPORTS TOPPLING CHIEF OF BREAKAWAY RUSSIAN REPUBLIC; CAUCASUS: BUT 
CHECHNYA'S LEADER APPEARS TO BE IN CONTROL OF THE CAPITAL. HE HAS BEEN A THORN 
IN MOSCOW'S SIDE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Pro-Russian opposition leaders in the north Caucasian republic of Chechnya 
announced Tuesday that they had toppled President Dzhokar Dudayev, the fierce 
former Soviet air force general who has been a thorn in Moscow's side since he 
declared his tiny Muslim republic to be independent from Russia in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Dudayev, however, appeared to be firmly in control at least in the Chechen 
capital, Grozny. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview with the Interfax news agency late Tuesday evening, the 
president said his overthrow had been announced in order to pave the way for 
Russian troops to invade Chechnya, a republic of 1.2 million people. 
</P>
<P>
 The commander of an elite Russian paratroop division, responding to rumors 
that his unit in Tula, in central Russia, had been put on alert, denied that 
Moscow had any plans to invade Chechnya. 
</P>
<P>
 The coup leader, Umar Avturkhanov, appeared on Russian television Tuesday 
evening claiming that up to 80% of the Chechen people and most of the military 
supported him. Avturkhanov also said Moscow had recognized his group, the 
Provisional Council, as the only legitimate authority in Chechnya. 
</P>
<P>
 "Russia has made its choice," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Avturkhanov spoke from Moscow, Ostankino television reported from 
Grozny that troops loyal to him controlled most of the Chechen countryside 
while Dudayev's units were firmly in control of the capital and showed no signs 
of surrendering. 
</P>
<P>
 Several large army units had not yet chosen sides, according to Ostankino. No 
fighting was reported. 
</P>
<P>
 Moscow has made no secret of its contempt for Dudayev, a defiant maverick who 
came to power in a disputed election in 1991 and has since slashed all ties 
with Russia and insisted that Chechnya be recognized as a sovereign nation. The 
Russian Federation considers Chechnya to be one of its 88 republics. 
</P>
<P>
 For his part, Dudayev blames Moscow for an assassination attempt against him 
earlier this year. And he accuses Russia of trying to reconquer its lost colony 
and oppress the Chechen people. 
</P>
<P>
 The 50-year-old former general is the leading bad boy of the former Soviet 
Union. The onetime nuclear bomber pilot sports a pencil mustache, elevator 
shoes and a flock of machine gun-toting bodyguards in baggy Italianate suits. 
The president is also said to have a black belt in karate. 
</P>
<P>
 His outlaw image is in keeping with that of his countrymen, who are arguably 
the most hated and discriminated-against minority in the former Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
 Chechens recall with bitterness the Stalin-era deportation of their entire 
people; but Russians remember Chechnya only as the homeland of the much-feared 
"Chechen mafia" and of the terrorists who have been arrested in connection with 
four recent airplane and bus hijackings. 
</P>
<P>
 Opposition forces have had sporadic gun battles with Dudayev forces in the 
streets of Grozny for months, and a rocket once slammed into the presidential 
headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 But the situation in Chechnya grew even more tense this week as local leaders 
united in the Provisional Council and made it known they intended to oust 
Dudayev. 
</P>
<P>
 Upping the ante Monday, the Russian government accused Dudayev of persecuting 
the 150,000 Russians who live in Chechnya. President Boris N. Yeltsin's chief 
of staff, Sergei A. Filatov, also alleged that Dudayev supporters beheaded 
three Chechens who had helped Russian police catch a band of hijackers in 
southern Russia and had displayed their severed heads in downtown Grozny. 
</P>
<P>
 The Russian Interior Ministry produced two gruesome photographs of heads and 
headless corpses, which were broadcast repeatedly Monday on Russian state 
television. Journalists in Grozny, however, have turned up no evidence that any 
such beheading ever took place. The Moscow Times newspaper, in a sharply worded 
editorial published Tuesday, suggested that the Yeltsin government may be 
trying to prepare the Russian public for a military incursion. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday at noon, the Provisional Council headed by Avturkhanov sent a 
statement to Russian news agencies saying that Dudayev had been removed from 
office. The council also promised to hold new elections in the spring. 
Chechnya's general prosecutor retaliated by issuing an order for Avturkhanov's 
arrest on charges of high treason. 
</P>
<P>
 Within a few hours, a senior Russian official, Deputy Prime Minister Sergei M. 
Shakhrai, praised the Provisional Council, saying its principles were "vital to 
the survival of the Chechen nation." He praised the council for promising to 
hold elections and said Moscow would be willing to negotiate with a delegation 
of its leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 But other Russian officials warned against putting too much stock in the 
Provisional Council's claim to have seized control of what has been a virtual 
police state. 
</P>

 Times special correspondent Chris Bird, in Grozny, contributed to this report.

GORE WOOS UKRAINE WITH PROMISES OF AID IN RETURN FOR DISARMAMENT STEPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY MYCIO, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Wooing a new president to comply with the nuclear disarmament agreement signed 
by his predecessor, Vice President Al Gore paid a six-hour call on Kiev on 
Tuesday, bearing promises of U.S. aid if Ukraine continues to dismantle its 
nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 Gore also gave newly elected President Leonid Kuchma an invitation from 
President Clinton to visit Washington in November. 
</P>
<P>
 The vice president reiterated U.S. promises to give Ukraine up to $700 million 
in aid this year to scrap its warheads and speed up economic reforms. 
</P>
<P>
 "A democratic, prosperous and independent Ukraine is in America's national 
interests," Gore said. 
</P>
<P>
 He was greeted with warm diplomatic smiles and hearty handshakes during the 
first high-level U.S. visit to Ukraine since Kuchma's July 19 inauguration. 
</P>
<P>
 But both Ukrainian and Western officials warned that Kuchma's pro-Russian 
tilt, together with a new Parliament dominated by Communist hard-liners, could 
translate into a chillier, more demanding attitude on Kiev's part with respect 
to disarmament. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can already feel the change," said a Westerner closely involved in 
disarmament. "They will demand performance, not promises." 
</P>
<P>
 Gore pressed Ukraine, which has lagged behind nearly all its neighbors in 
introducing market reforms, to speed up the process so that it could qualify 
for more than $4 billion in aid from the Group of Seven industrialized nations. 
</P>
<P>
 Gore said Ukraine is already the world's fourth-largest recipient of American 
aid. 
</P>
<P>
 Kuchma has complained in the past that the aid amounts to "beautiful words" 
but no hard cash. He accepted the invitation to Washington on Nov. 29 but made 
no public statements after his meeting with Gore in the ornate 18th-Century 
Mariinsky Palace. 
</P>
<P>
 Ukraine has removed the nuclear warheads from about 200 missiles and shipped 
the warheads to Russia in exchange for 100 tons of nuclear fuel, in keeping 
with the trilateral nuclear statement signed in January by the United States, 
Russia and Ukraine. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States paid Russia $60 million to complete the deal. 
</P>
<P>
 Gore praised Ukraine for its speedy fulfillment of its side of the agreement. 
Kuchma has criticized the United States for being slow in disbursing the 
disarmament aid. 
</P>
<P>
 "Does America keep its promises?" he asked a delegation from the Ukrainian 
Congress Committee of America days after his inauguration. 
</P>
<P>
 Tougher rhetoric could signal trouble in implementing the rest of the 
trilateral agreement. Aside from the initial warhead-for-fuel swap, the pact 
does not specify how Ukraine is to get rid of its remaining 1,400 nuclear 
warheads except to say they must be scrapped within seven years. 
</P>
<P>
 It now seems likely that Ukraine will insist on receiving the money faster and 
demand more of it. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Gore said that he did not discuss the subject with Kuchma, he 
stressed in remarks to journalists that Ukraine must join the Nuclear 
Non-Proliferation Treaty as a condition of the trilateral pact. 
</P>
<P>
 Kuchma has said that he prefers to wait until 1995, when the treaty comes up 
for a legal overhaul. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps more worrisome for Washington, however, is the possibility that 
Kuchma's pro-Russian rhetoric will find expression in policy, thus changing 
Moscow's attitude toward Ukraine's disarmament. 
</P>
<P>
 Konstantin Zatulin, a key Russian lawmaker, told a popular Ukrainian newspaper

 Police detonated a bomb found at the Buenos Aires metropolitan airport, two 
weeks after a blast killed nearly 100 people at the offices of the main local 
Jewish group.The device, which officials said appeared designed to produce 
noise but not destruction, was found during a one-day general strike backed by 
transport workers and other opposition trade unionists. No one claimed 
responsibility. An Air Force Police official said the device was found in a 
restaurant bathroom at the Jorge Newberry Airport near central Buenos Aires. 
Disposal experts removed the bomb and detonated it in an isolated part of the 
airfield, he said.

 Kuwaiti and U.S. troops staged joint maneuvers and U.S. jets bombed abandoned 
Iraqi tanks in the desert, displaying U.S. resolve to protect the emirate on 
the fourth anniversary of Iraq's invasion. About 1,500 American soldiers and 
several hundred Kuwaitis participated in the exercises. The maneuvers were the 
latest in a series of joint exercises staged under a 10-year defense pact that 
Kuwait signed with Washington in 1991.

 Serbia, facing the prospect of stiffer sanctions, said it would sever 
relations with the Bosnian Serbs if they continue to reject the latest 
international peace plan. The Bosnian Serbs said their self-declared parliament 
will meet in Pale today to debate calling a referendum on whether to accept the 
peace plan drawn up by the United States, Russia, Britain, Germany and France. 
The threat to sever ties came in a letter from the government of Serbian 
President Slobodan Milosevic that slammed the Serbs in neighboring 
Bosnia-Herzegovina for their continued rejection of the peace plan.

PUBLIC SAFETY; DEADLY COLORADO FIRE LIKELY TO SPARK REFORM; DESPITE HIGH-TECH 
METHODS AND TRAINING, FIGHTING MODERN-DAY WILDERNESS BLAZES STILL POSES RISKS. 
STRATEGIES FOR BETTER PROTECTION FOR CREWS ARE UNDER REVIEW. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Aside from silvery skeletons of Douglas fir silhouetted against the sky, 
little hint remains of the fury that once engulfed a high mountainside in the 
Shoshone National Forest west of here. 
</P>
<P>
 On a hot August afternoon in 1937, sudden winds blew a lackadaisical forest 
fire into an inferno. Eight men who had clambered down loose volcanic slopes in 
pursuit of stray embers perished when a narrow gulch -- a convenient chimney 
for the fire -- turned into their death trap. 
</P>
<P>
 Above them, 40 others scrambled uphill, trying desperately to escape the 
flames that roared like a locomotive on their heels. Seven did not make it. 
</P>
<P>
 In the annals of American wildfire, the 1937 Blackwater fire was among the 
blackest blazes of all -- one of just two fires to kill at least 15 
firefighters since 1933, when a brush fire in Southern California's Griffith 
Park caught 25 off guard. Like many conflagrations in its wake, Blackwater 
triggered critical reforms in government firefighting policy. 
</P>
<P>
 But despite reforms and technological advances in the six decades since, the 
blazes that lace Western wilderness each summer still leave no room for error. 
Then, untrained Civilian Conservation Corps enrollees were the victims. This 
time, it was 14 smoke jumpers, "hot-shot" crews and "helitackers" (who rappel 
from helicopters) swept up by flames and killed as they battled a routine 
lightning fire on July 6 near Glenwood Springs, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators are now trying to tell what strategy might have saved those 
well-trained crews. 
</P>
<P>
 There were almost certainly mistakes: Firefighters apparently were not alert 
to a coming cold front, which may have fueled winds that whipped the blaze into 
its fatal rage. They posted few, if any, lookouts to watch for such blowups. 
They were scratching fire lines downhill, with flames beneath them -- a 
dangerous gamble. 
</P>
<P>
 But like no previous blaze, last month's fire may force government brass to 
rethink the fundamentals of fire policy. Americans' propensity to build homes 
amid flammable brush and forests, to quash fires so that volatile fuels build 
up, and to then expect fire crews to serve as the buffer may bring gung-ho 
firefighters too close to deadly blazes. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're putting more firefighters on more lines for longer periods with a more 
critical need to protect structures than we ever had before," says Gardner 
Ferry, fire program manager at the National Interagency Fire Center in Boise, 
Ida. "The more people you have on more lines under more critical conditions, 
the more often mistakes will mount up on you. It looks like that's what we saw 
in Colorado." 
</P>
<P>
 As teams on Storm King Mountain raced up impossibly steep slopes -- brush 
igniting behind them -- their fire shelters, radios and fire-retardant clothes 
were no help. It boiled down to an eerie replay of both the Blackwater fire and 
a 1949 blaze that claimed 13 smoke jumpers who parachuted into Mann Gulch, 
Mont., and then could not outpace sparks that chased them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I couldn't help but think this was a lot like that Blackwater fire," says 
Carl Wilson, a retired U.S. Forest Service fire behavior expert and now fire 
commissioner in Berkeley. "It just chilled my blood, because things were 
improving. I didn't figure we could have these fires that would take 14 lives 
at a time anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 In a study of fatal forest fires, Wilson found blazes that take lives are 
almost always small and innocent until wind shifts or steep topography 
transform them into killers. A passing cold front can twist the wind at right 
angles, turning what was the broad flank of a fire into a ferocious maw. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the best-trained firefighters may die when they forget flames can run 
uphill faster than people. Those who survive often outwit blazes by dodging 
into burned spots already free of fuel -- just the way some of the 52 attacking 
the Colorado fire survived. 
</P>
<P>
 It often takes tragic fires to spur safety reforms. Following the Blackwater 
fire, a review identified communication gaps, poor weather forecasts and 
inexperience as factors. Within two years, the Forest Service had curtailed its 
use of CCC recruits and the lead investigator of the Blackwater disaster had 
pushed for trained fire teams such as smoke jumpers and the predecessor of 
today's crack hot-shot crews, who hike or parachute into rugged terrain. 
</P>
<P>
 After a 1956 blaze killed 11 firefighters in Southern California's Cleveland 
National Forest, a panel drew up 10 safety orders for firefighters. In the wake 
of a 1976 Colorado blaze that burned four men, government agencies mandated 
that anyone stalking a wildfire carry a metallic fire shelter for temporary 
refuge in the face of flames. 
</P>
<P>
 But such last-ditch defenses may hand firefighters a false sense of security. 
Fire shelters ward off heat but cannot withstand direct flame. By passing them 
out to fire crews, asks Ben Beall of the California-Nevada-Hawaii Forest Fire 
Council, "are we getting ourselves in closer contact with these fires than we 
have to?" 
</P>
<P>
 If fire teams heed basic rules -- posting lookouts, assuring communication, 
watching weather, checking escape routes -- there is no reason for tragedy, 
says Dave Aldrich, chief of fire training for the Forest Service. When those 
tenets are either overlooked or ignored, trouble brews. 
</P>
<P>
 With the windy front in Colorado predicted for more than a day, "there were 
indicators somebody didn't see," says Stan Palmer, safety manager at the 
National Interagency Fire Center. In the mad rush to defeat blazes under the 
noble visage of Smokey Bear, such lapses are common. During a forest fire in 
Idaho, Palmer warned four 20-person crews off a slope where they were building 
fire lines with flames behind them and smoke billowing above. 
</P>
<P>
 Two hours later, the hillside erupted. 
</P>
<P>
 "They don't see these things," Palmer says. "They've got their heads down and 
they're throwing dirt." 
</P>
<P>
 With the West explosively dry this summer, firefighters may be closer to the 
brink than ever. "Fire behavior is so extreme that the time frames for 
decision-making are extremely short," said a nationwide alert sent to fire 
crews after the Colorado catastrophe. 
</P>
<P>
 But flare-ups should be no surprise, argues Neil Sampson, chairman of the 
National Commission on Wildfire Disasters. In March, the panel issued a report 
that examined the costly 1993 Los Angeles area fires and 1988 fires in 
Yellowstone National Park and found "conditions on the land make wildfire not 
only highly likely but also highly unmanageable." 
</P>
<P>
 Brush that burned in last fall's Altadena fire, typically charred every 20 
years or so, had accumulated for 118 years and defied control when it finally 
caught fire, Sampson says. The 14 young firefighters who died in Colorado were 
trying to extinguish chaparral that had not burned in a century. 
</P>
<P>
 And like the Blackwater blaze, the latest deadly fire -- finally stamped out 
for $2 million -- will not be the last. "We're wiping out our room for 
maneuvering," says Arizona State University Prof. Stephen Pyne, the nation's 
top fire historian. "It's harder to pull back to the next ridge, to not go in. 
We've put ourselves in a bind where fatalities may not be necessary, but they 
seem inevitable."

RWANDAN LEADERS CALL FOR GENOCIDE TRIALS TO PUNISH HUTU OFFICIALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By from The Washington Post 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This country's new president and prime minister called Tuesday for genocide 
trials as soon as possible against Hutu officials who planned, ordered and 
carried out the killings of hundreds of thousands of Rwandans from the Tutsi 
minority during the nation's 3 1/2-month civil war. 
</P>
<P>
 In separate interviews, both leaders of the Tutsi-dominated rebel government 
now in power said they envision a genocide tribunal in which outside powers 
would participate in the role of observers. They said that to allow foreign 
governments or the United Nations to control the tribunal, as in the Bosnian 
conflict, would most likely lead to unacceptably long delays. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want a transparent system, but we don't want to wait as long a time as in 
Yugoslavia," said President Pasteur Bizimungu, a moderate Hutu who was 
installed in office last month after the Rwandan Patriotic Front overran the 
army of the former Hutu-dominated government. 
</P>
<P>
 Both leaders said they saw no conflict between proceeding swiftly with 
genocide trials at the same time they are proclaiming their desire to build a 
government of national reconciliation -- and trying to convince millions of 
Hutu refugees who fled after the rebel victory that it is safe to return. 
</P>
<P>
 "Reconciliation cannot be built on impunity," said Bizimungu, interviewed on 
the second-story veranda of his presidential mansion. "Justice must be the 
pillar of reconciliation." 
</P>
<P>
 He said that if the government does not move quickly with genocide trials, 
then "victims will be inclined to make justice themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 Most of those responsible for the bloodshed have fled to Zaire. 
</P>
<P>
 Prime Minister Faustin Twagirimungu noted that Rwanda already has a special 
provision in its criminal justice system that calls for death by firing squad 
for anyone convicted of genocide. He said he expected some ministers of the 
former government, as well as leaders of extremist militias, to be brought to 
trial -- and, if found guilty, to face execution.

DYSENTERY WILL BOOST DEATHS, OFFICIAL PREDICTS

<P>
 As dysentery steals cholera's grim title as the most widespread affliction in 
Goma's refugee camps, one relief official Tuesday predicted the almost 
unimaginable -- an upsurge in deaths. 
</P>
<P>
 Children will be hardest hit, she said, by the deadly dysentery spreading 
among the more than 1 million Rwandans jammed into camps along Zaire's eastern 
border. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dysentery has overtaken cholera" as the main disease afflicting refugees, 
said Samantha Bolton of the relief group Doctors Without Borders. 
</P>
<P>
 Cholera and dysentery are both spread by fecal contamination of food and 
water. Cholera is treated with an infusion of liquids and minerals to replace 
those lost through vomiting and diarrhea. Dysentery requires five days of 
costly antibiotics.

DOMINICANS TO ALLOW PATROLS OF BORDER WITH HAITI 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Officials from the Dominican Republic said Tuesday that they have reached an 
agreement allowing an international force to patrol the country's border and 
prevent smuggling of fuel and other goods into Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. and Dominican officials said the mission will include more than 80 
civilian and military personnel from the United States, Canada, Argentina and 
Brazil, expected to arrive within two weeks.Brazil, however, later denied that 
it will help staff the force. 
</P>
<P>
 In Washington, the Defense Department said it will supply six helicopters to 
be flown by Dominican Republic pilots. 
</P>
<P>
 It will also send the Dominican Republic 50 trucks, 45 motorcycles, six 
inflatable boats and 106 radios for the operation, the department said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pentagon spokesman Dennis Boxx said the international force will not stop the 
smugglers but rather report them to Dominican Republic border authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 Smuggling of fuel across the nations' border is considered a major reason for 
the failure of a U.N. economic embargo to force the ouster of Haiti's military 
leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 News of the agreement came as President Joaquin Balaguer was declared winner 
of the Dominican Republic's May presidential election, which critics said was 
riddled with fraud. Balaguer was reelected by a margin of less than 1% over 
opposition candidate Jose Francisco Pena Gomez, the Central Elections Board 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 By constitutional mandate, the elections board had to declare a winner before 
inauguration day, scheduled for Aug. 16.

 Rep. Alan Wheat became the first black person nominated to statewide office in 
Missouri on Tuesday, winning the Democratic nomination for the seat of retiring 
Sen. John C. Danforth. Former Gov. John Ashcroft easily captured the GOP 
nomination. 
</P>
<P>
 In Detroit, Democratic Rep. John Conyers, chairman of the House Government 
Operations Committee and the most senior black congressman, turned back his 
first serious primary challenge in 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
 With 89% of precincts reporting, Conyers had 32,980 votes or 50.8%, lawyer 
Melvin Hollowell had 18,558 votes or 28.6% and former city ombudsman Marie 
Farrell-Donaldson had 13,332 votes or 20.5%. Conyers, who has lost two 
campaigns for mayor of Detroit, was criticized by both his opponents for 
missing nearly one-third of House votes last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Michigan also had a Senate primary, for the seat of Democratic Sen. Donald W. 
Riegle Jr., whose decision not to seek a fourth six-year term drew a crowded 
field. 
</P>
<P>
 Races for governor were on the ballot in Michigan, where GOP Gov. John Engler 
is seeking a second term in the fall, and Kansas, where Democratic Gov. Joan 
Finney is stepping down after one term. 
</P>
<P>
 In Missouri, Wheat, a six-term congressman, fended off a strong challenge from 
Jackson County Executive Marsha Murphy for the Democratic Senate nomination. 
The Republican Danforth is retiring after three terms from the seat once held 
by Harry S. Truman to devote full time to the Episcopal church. 
</P>
<P>
 With 95% of precincts reporting, Wheat had 203,801 votes, or 41%, to Murphy's 
192,285 votes, or 38%. On the GOP side, Ashcroft, a former two-term governor, 
swamped his four rivals with 83% of the vote. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, 34 Senate seats are on ballots this year. 
</P>
<P>
 In Kansas' gubernatorial race, six-term Rep. Jim Slattery defeated four other 
Democrats. Kansas Secretary of State Bill Graves beat five rivals for the GOP 
nomination. 
</P>
<P>
 In Michigan, state Sen. Debbie Stabenow and former Rep. Howard Wolpe were in a 
close race for the right to challenge Engler, who had no primary opposition.

 Former Missouri Gov. John Ashcroft easily won the GOP nomination for retiring 
Sen. John Danforth's seat Tuesday, while on the Democratic side, Rep. Alan 
Wheat led in his bid to become the first black person nominated to statewide 
office. 
</P>
<P>
 Danforth is retiring after three terms to devote full time to the Episcopal 
church. In very early returns, Ashcroft, a former two-term governor, had 1,125 
votes, or 79%, swamping his four rivals. 
</P>
<P>
 On the Democratic side, Wheat, a six-term congressman, had 1,246 votes, or 
40%, followed by Jackson County Executive Marsha Murphy's 1,088 votes, or 35%. 
</P>
<P>
 In Michigan, Democratic Sen. Donald W. Riegle Jr.'s decision not to seek a 
fourth six-year term drew a field of six Democrats and two Republicans, 
including former talk show host Ronna Romney. 
</P>
<P>
 Recent polls showed Romney locked in a tight race with Spencer Abraham, an 
assistant to former Vice President Dan Quayle. Romney is divorced from the son 
of George Romney, the former Michigan governor and 1968 presidential candidate. 
Rep. Bob Carr held a slight edge over the other Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
 The two Senate seats are among nine up for election this year in which 
incumbents are not running. Six of those seats are held by Democrats. 
Republicans hope to win at least seven of the open seats to help them gain 
control of the Senate, where Democrats hold a 56-44 majority. In all, 34 Senate 
seats are on ballots this year. 
</P>
<P>
 In gubernatorial politics, six Republicans and five Democrats fought to fill 
the seat of Kansas Gov. Joan Finney, who is stepping down after one term. In 
Michigan, four Democrats battled for the right to challenge GOP Gov. John 
Engler in the Nov. 8 general election. 
</P>
<P>
 And in Detroit, Democratic Rep. John Conyers Jr., a senior member of the 
Congressional Black Caucus, faced his first serious primary challenge in 30 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 Conyers, who unsuccessfully ran for mayor of Detroit in 1989 and 1993, faced 
lawyer Melvin Hollowell and former Detroit ombudsman Marie Farrell-Donaldson. 
Both criticized Conyers.

DISTRICTS DESIGNED TO FAVOR BLACKS RULED LEGAL BY COURT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Even though two oddly shaped congressional districts were drawn to ensure that 
blacks are elected, they are legal because their aim is to correct past 
injustices, a panel of federal judges has ruled. 
</P>
<P>
 The 2-1 ruling on Monday rejected a lawsuit by five white voters who claimed 
that the state's redistricting plan was unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a justifiable invocation of a concededly drastic . . . remedy in order 
to continue the laborious struggle to break free of a legacy of racial bloc 
voting," U.S. District Judge J. Dickson Phillips Jr. wrote for the majority. 
</P>
<P>
 The dissenting judge, Richard Voorhees, wrote that the plan means that "North 
Carolinians must live for an indefinite period of time with congressional 
districts in which the races are intentionally made 'separate but equal' 
without sufficient justification." 
</P>
<P>
 One of the plaintiffs, Duke University law professor Melvin Shimm, said he 
expected an appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
 The majority agreed with the plaintiffs' claim that the districts were 
racially gerrymandered -- drawn to make it likely that blacks would be elected 
-- but said that did not violate voters' rights. 
</P>
<P>
 "The plan passes constitutional muster under that standard because it is 
narrowly tailored to further the state's compelling interest in complying with 
the Voting Rights Act," Phillips wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 The redistricting created black voter majorities in the 1st and 12th 
congressional districts. Two years ago, Eva Clayton and Mel Watt became North 
Carolina's first black U.S. representatives since 1901. 
</P>
<P>
 Watt's district, the 12th, is a narrow band that runs 160 miles along 
Interstate 85 from Gastonia to Durham. The 1st District, represented by 
Clayton, begins at the Virginia line in the northeast part of the state and 
weaves east to within a few miles of the South Carolina line. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, a federal court eliminated a majority-black congressional district 
in Louisiana, saying its contorted shape amounted to racial gerrymandering. 
That panel said that blacks have enough protection against discrimination and 
that discarding traditional districting principles to carve out one-race 
districts simply for the sake of race is contrary to the Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
 In June, 1993, the Supreme Court ruled that state legislatures may be 
violating white voters' rights when they create congressional districts 
designed to give minorities a majority. The judges said that states must have a 
compelling reason to make such districts. 
</P>
<P>
 In light of the high court ruling, the North Carolina panel took another look 
but decided Monday that past discrimination was a compelling reason.

KILLER EXECUTED ON 'HAPPY FACE' DEATH WARRANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A man whose death warrant was signed with a "happy face" was executed early 
Tuesday, 11 years after killing a teen-ager who gave him a ride. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Drew coughed and gasped, and tears streamed down his face as a needle 
carrying lethal chemicals was inserted into his left arm, just where a tattoo 
of a green cobra was inscribed "Big Bad Bob." 
</P>
<P>
 Drew, 35, insisted to the end that he did not stab and beat Jeffrey Mays to 
death after the 17-year-old from Birmingham, Ala., picked him up in February, 
1983. 
</P>
<P>
 "Remember, the death penalty is legal murder," Drew said while strapped to the 
Texas death chamber gurney. "Tonight they're taking the life of an innocent 
man." 
</P>
<P>
 Drew's attorneys, Ronald Kuby and William Kunstler of New York, had appealed 
Monday. They contended that another hitchhiker in the car was responsible for 
the killing. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Supreme Court, however, rejected Drew's claims in two separate 
rulings, and Texas Gov. Ann Richards refused a reprieve. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is such a relief," Mays' mother, Rebecca, said after learning Drew was 
dead. "He went to his death knowing what he did and still trying to convince 
people he was innocent." 
</P>
<P>
 Drew's case had angered death penalty opponents when a Houston judge signed 
his death warrant with a "happy face." The judge defended the action, saying he 
had signed all of his correspondence for years with the cartoon.

LAW FIRM DROPS CASE INVOLVING SUSPECT IN CLINIC KILLINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By The Washington Post 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A law firm funded by conservative broadcaster Pat Robertson said Tuesday that 
it will no longer represent former Presbyterian minister Paul J. Hill on 
charges that he harassed patients at a Pensacola abortion clinic six weeks 
before a physician and his escort were killed there Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The American Center for Law and Justice, based in Virginia Beach, Va., said it 
had asked to withdraw from the June 17 disorderly conduct case against Hill 
because it condemns the Friday shotgun killings of John B. Britton, a physician 
at The Ladies Center, and his escort, retired Air Force Lt. Col. James H. 
Barrett.Hill has been charged in the killings. 
</P>
<P>
 Eugene Kapp, a spokesman for the law center, said the ACLJ "strongly condemns 
the shootings and reaffirms its longstanding position that violence has no 
place in the pro-life movement."

CLINTON TAPS TEMPORARY LIAISON ON AIDS POLICY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF LEEDS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton, moving to plug holes in an AIDS-fighting policy that 
activists say is sagging, Tuesday named a temporary replacement for the White 
House AIDS coordinator who resigned under fire last month. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton appointed Patricia S. Fleming, an aide to Health and Human Services 
Secretary Donna Shalala, to the post until the White House finds a permanent 
coordinator, which is expected to take about 60 days. 
</P>
<P>
 "This Administration has made significant strides in the fight against this 
terrible epidemic," Clinton said. "Patsy Fleming will make sure we don't lose 
our momentum." 
</P>
<P>
 Fleming, who worked as a health issues specialist for the late Rep. Ted Weiss 
(D-N.Y.), said she will return to the Health and Human Services Department when 
a permanent coordinator is found, and she will not be in the running for the 
job. 
</P>
<P>
 "Though we've made considerable progress in coming to grips with this 
epidemic, much more remains to be done," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fleming replaces Kristine M. Gebbie, who stepped down last month after AIDS 
activists derided her for failing to increase the importance of the epidemic on 
the national agenda. Activists said that Clinton, who created the White House 
AIDS coordinator post to oversee cooperation between federal agencies that deal 
with different aspects of the AIDS crisis, never gave Gebbie enough power to 
begin dealing with the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 American Foundation for AIDS Research President Mervyn Silverman said that 
Fleming will "successfully define the tasks at hand," something critics say 
Gebbie was never able to do. 
</P>
<P>
 Some AIDS activists, incensed that Clinton replaced Gebbie for a short time 
without restructuring the job to give it more authority, say the move 
represents a "huge backslide." 
</P>
<P>
 "Two months is a lifetime for people with AIDS," said Thomas F. Sheridan, 
treasurer of AIDSPAC, a lobbying group for research. "This is wasted time." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton promised during his 1992 presidential campaign to create the post, but 
the job has proved unnecessary because most health agency chiefs have tried to 
spur support for battling AIDS by themselves, said Peter Staley, founder of the 
New York Treatment Action Group, an AIDS advocacy organization.

BOY, SISTER HANG SELVES AT PLAY

<TEXT>
<P>
 A young brother and sister were apparently engaged in horseplay when they 
slipped and hanged themselves in a tragic accident, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They apparently hanged themselves with a rope that was on a tree," Sgt. Joe 
Forti of the North Las Vegas Police Department said Tuesday."There were no 
signs of foul play. It appears it was just two tragic accidental deaths. They 
were engaged in horseplay and a tragedy occurred." 
</P>
<P>
 Forti said there were chairs nearby that had been tipped over and it appeared 
the victims, a 12-year-old girl and 10-year-old boy, had been standing on them. 
</P>
<P>
 "The preliminary indication is they were just kind of playing and things got 
carried away," Forti said. 
</P>
<P>
 Forti said the mother of the victims was in California and that the children 
had been staying with relatives. He said the mother had been notified of the 
tragedy and that police planned to talk to her when she returned to Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
 The names of the victims were not released.

WILSON AHEAD OF BROWN IN CAMPAIGN CASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL JACOBS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As the candidates for governor head for their November showdown, incumbent 
Pete Wilson holds a decided edge in campaign cash over his Democratic rival, 
state Treasurer Kathleen Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 In a finance statement released Tuesday, the Republican governor's campaign 
committee reported having more than $4.7 million on hand at the end of June. 
That is almost twice the $2.5 million reported by the Brown campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the two candidates were collecting contributions at about the same 
pace -- each taking in about $2.8 million in the latest reporting period, 
between May 22 and June 30. 
</P>
<P>
 Both candidates are engaging in the nonstop fund raising that has become 
standard in high-profile statewide races. Brown has spent more than $9 million 
in defeating Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi in the primary and in 
gearing up for the fall. Wilson spent more than $10 million as he defeated 
businessman Ron Unz for the Republican nomination. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither side will say just how much it plans to raise and spend between now 
and November. But privately there is acknowledgment that each camp probably 
will raise and spend another $10 million before Election Day. 
</P>
<P>
 "The key factor is that we have twice as much money on hand as Brown does," 
said George Gorton, Wilson's campaign manager. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Gorton said, Wilson had to raise funds to pay off debts acquired in 
beating back a legal challenge to the redistricting of legislative and 
congressional districts and to support ballot measures and legislative 
candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, the governor has been raising money faster and spending it more 
slowly than his Democratic opponent, Gorton said. He predicted that Brown would 
have trouble keeping pace with the governor's fund raising because her fellow 
Democrat, U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein, is in an unexpectedly tough race to keep 
her seat against a Republican challenger, businessman Michael Huffington. 
</P>
<P>
 While Huffington is using his own fortune to fund most of his campaign, 
Feinstein is turning to many of the same donors who are being asked to help 
Brown in the governor's race. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the Brown campaign says it has been matching Wilson's fund-raising 
efforts since the June election. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a great three weeks after the primary," said Brown campaign spokesman 
Steve Glazer. "We raised $2.5 million in those three weeks." 
</P>
<P>
 Glazer predicted that Brown's fund-raising pace would accelerate in the three 
months until the election. "Wilson's leadership deficit exceeds our temporary 
cash difference," Glazer said. Governor's Race Fund Raising 
</P>
<P>
 In the latest campaign reporting period, May 22 through June 30, Gov. Pete 
Wilson and Treasurer Kathleen Brown each received about $2.8 million in 
contributions. But Wilson, the Republican, began the general election campaign 
season with almost twice as much money on hand as Brown, the Democrat. 
04,20,15,16,15 Raised Total Raised Cash on Hand This Period to Date* (June 30) 
Kathleen Brown (D) $2.78 million $11.93 million $2.51 million Pete Wilson (R) 
$2.85 million $15.13 million $4.71 million * Figures include amounts

GOING BEYOND THE ANONYMOUS STATISTICS OF MASS TRAGEDY; BOOK REVIEW: BIOGRAPHY; 
TO PAINT HER LIFE; CHARLOTTE SALOMON IN THE NAZI ERA BY MARY LOWENTHAL 
FELSTINER , HARPERCOLLINS, $27.50, 304 PAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN KIRSCH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The tragedy in Rwanda, like other recent scenes of suffering in Somalia and 
Bosnia and Haiti, poses the danger that we will see only a vast sea of troubles 
and not the men, women and children who, one by one, suffer and die before our 
very eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 The same moral danger arises whenever we contemplate the Holocaust. And that's 
why a book like Mary Lowenthal Felstiner's "To Paint Her Life" is so surprising 
and ultimately so important -- the author introduces us to a gifted young woman 
whom we come to know not merely as a victim of genocide, but as a human being 
and an artist of extraordinary gifts. 
</P>
<P>
 Charlotte Salomon, as we learn in "To Paint Her Life," was born in Berlin in 
1917 and died in Auschwitz at the age of 26. Within the span of a single year 
during World War II -- "(as) the war raged on and I sat by the sea and saw deep 
into the heart of humankind" -- she created more than 700 paintings and 
hundreds of other drawings, captions, playlets and operettas that amount to an 
autobiography in word and image. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the thick of fear, she created the most penetrating visual record we have 
from the Nazi era about a single life," Felstiner explains of the body of work 
that we glimpse in the pages of her book. "She only guessed it would give vital 
knowledge past its time, saying to a friend when she packed it away, 'Keep this 
safe. It is my whole life.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Felstiner takes some daring risks in telling the story of Charlotte Salomon, 
and she indulges in narrative techniques we might expect to find in an 
experimental novel rather than in a work of history or biography. And, frankly, 
the text can be taxing at moments. But the rewards are rich enough to justify 
the effort -- "To Paint Her Life" is something truly remarkable, a work of art 
in its own right and a masterpiece in the field of Holocaust studies. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, Felstiner refers to not one but three incarnations of Charlotte 
Salomon -- Lotte is "the real-life one," Charlotte is "the made-up character" 
who appears in Lotte's paintings and playlets, and CS is Charlotte Salomon in 
her incarnation as the artist who stands back and paints her own life under the 
title "Life? or Theater?" 
</P>
<P>
 Felstiner explains that Charlotte Salomon grew up in a "house of suicides," 
and the author shows how CS struggled to make sense of half a dozen such 
deaths. "One two three four five six," went the rhyme that accompanied a 
painting of various dead relations, "does this mean we have a hex?" 
</P>
<P>
 But Felstiner goes on to explain exactly what it meant when a Jew committed 
suicide in Germany. She cites the Jewish suicide rate in Prussia 1923-27 -- a 
stunning 530 deaths per million against 280 Protestants and 135 Catholics -- 
and ponders the fear and alienation that helps to explain it: "You Jews who 
take modernity's prize," writes the author, "you pay its price." 
</P>
<P>
 At times, "To Paint Her Life" achieves a certain songlike quality and poetic 
grandeur -- it's a fugue of art and history, love and pain, sexuality and 
politics -- and it reaches a shattering crescendo in the very last, speculative 
passage, when we follow Charlotte into the gas chamber at Auschwitz. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, at the same time, Felstiner is clearly a tenacious and disciplined 
historian who brings to her work an impressive command of source materials and, 
not incidentally, a focus on the experience of women in the Holocaust. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Charlotte's) states of mind make visible the inner stages of a huge 
historical process," Felstiner writes of her technique, which she calls 
"personified history, a way of embodying an era's irony and tragedy, its surge 
of suicide and genocide, within a few uncommon lives." 
</P>
<P>
 As a counterpoint to Charlotte, the author gives us the figure of Alois 
Brunner, one of Adolf Eichmann's lieutenants and the mastermind of the round-up 
of Jews that ensnared the doomed young artist in her refuge on the French 
Riviera. And Felstiner paints the heartbreaking scene of the day that 
Charlotte's freedom came to an end at last. 
</P>
<P>
 Drawing on historical records, Felstiner recalls how Brunner stood on the 
balcony of the Hotel Excelsior in Nice and surveyed the latest catch of Jewish 
refugees before dispatching them to the death camps. And then she imagines:  
</P>
<P>
 "Brunner's fingers were simply counting up the creatures down below. His eyes 
were passing over Lotte Salomon and seeing nobody at all." 
</P>
<P>
 Felstiner's book reminds us that we are invited to collaborate with the mass 
murderers whenever we fail to appreciate the fact that each victim of the 
Holocaust was a human being with a distinct face. Felstiner rescues Charlotte 
Salomon from the terrible statistical anonymity of "the Six Million" and gives 
her a visage that is both beautiful and haunting.

 CBS' "60 Minutes" and ABC's "20/20" cracked the Top 10, but otherwise it was 
comedy that dominated America's television viewing last week, according to 
ratings released Tuesday by the A. C. Nielsen Co. ABC's "Home Improvement" 
(starring Tim Allen) and "Grace Under Fire" were on top, followed by NBC's 
"Seinfeld" and "Frasier." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet CBS edged out its rivals in the network race, thanks to strong showings on 
Saturday, Sunday and Monday, where "The Nanny," running outside its usual time 
slot, tied at No. 17--its first finish in the Top 20. In its regular airing on 
Wednesday, it ranked 33rd. 
</P>
<P>
 Fox's effort to transfer the daytime children's hit "The Mighty Morphin Power 
Rangers" to prime time met with an unenthusiastic response from most viewers. 
The Friday night telecast ranked 80th among the week's 86 prime-time network 
programs--although Fox said it attracted 36% of the available children.

LAKE FOREST TO FILE SUIT OVER EL TORO INITIATIVE; DEVELOPMENT: CITY COUNCIL 
MEMBERS SAY THE BALLOT MEASURE, WHICH SUPPORTS A COMMERCIAL AIRPORT AT THE 
MARINE FACILITY, IS INCONSISTENT WITH THE COUNTY GENERAL PLAN AND PROMOTES 
CHAOS AND LITIGATION.

<P>
 In an unexpected move, the Lake Forest City Council announced Tuesday night 
that it will file a lawsuit seeking to remove an initiative from the November 
ballot that calls for a commercial airport at the El Toro Marine Corps Air 
Station. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members emerged from a closed session to announce that they had voted 
unanimously to file a lawsuit against sponsors of the initiative, the Committee 
for 21,000 New Jobs, saying the measure is inconsistent with the county General 
Plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Immediately after their surprise announcement, council members issued a press 
release to explain their decision but made no other public statements. 
</P>
<P>
 "These inconsistencies, if adopted, will promote chaos and litigation over 
matters such as building intensity standards, traffic capabilities and noise 
problems," Mayor Marcia Rudolph said in the statement. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council maintains that the initiative will change the General Plan to 
allow a commercial airport but will not address other issues such as 
transportation and noise. 
</P>
<P>
 The measure also will bypass state planning laws, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is another example of special-interest attempts to sell their products 
by 'ballot box planning,' of a piecemeal nature to circumvent a California 
environmental quality act," Councilman Tim Link said in the press release. 
</P>
<P>
 Some proponents of the initiative expressed surprise at the council's action 
but did not express concern. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was an initiative signed by over a 100,000 Orange County voters, far in 
excess of the requirement" to place it on the ballot, said Garden Grove 
Councilman Mark Leyes, who supports the initiative. By saying they will file a 
lawsuit, Lake Forest council members "don't give voters enough credit," Leyes 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Buck Johns, a developer who is a major financial backer of the initiative, 
said, "It will be interesting to see what's going to happen. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "Lake Forest has been pretty aggressive in this, haven't they?" Johns said. 
"This is the first I've heard" of a lawsuit. "I wish them well." 
</P>
<P>
 Lake Forest's announcement surprised even its allies.  
</P>
<P>
 "I wasn't even aware of this until now," said Mission Viejo Mayor Susan 
Withrow, a member of the South County Working Group, a coalition of cities that 
was established to create alternative proposals to a commercial airport. The 
group includes Lake Forest. 
</P>
<P>
 Withrow said the coalition rejected filing a similar lawsuit two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "We weren't confident of what the results would be," she said. "We didn't want 
the public to perceive a lawsuit as an elite action that would squelch the 
public's right to vote." 
</P>
<P>
 But a single-party lawsuit by Lake Forest wouldn't be elitist, Withrow said. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with Irvine and the County Board of Supervisors, Lake Forest is a member 
of the El Toro Reuse Planning Authority board of directors, set up to determine 
how the El Toro base should be used after its closure by 1999. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Ann Van Haun, Lake Forest's representative on the Planning 
Authority board, said the initiative would usurp the group's authority. 
</P>
<P>
 The authority, "established by the county of Orange and the cities of Irvine 
and Lake Forest, and recognized by the surrounding communities and the federal 
government as the local planning agency, would be completely short-circuited by 
a mandatory airport authority," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lake Forest officials acknowledged that obtaining a court order to remove the 
initiative might be difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 "The city of Lake Forest has a duty to challenge the legality of the 
initiative," Councilman Richard T. Dixon said in the written statement. "If we 
do not take action now, people will wonder. If we do act now, we may succeed in 
knocking it off the ballot." 
</P>
<P>
 The initiative qualified in the June election primary with 118,000 signatures. 
Supporters backing the measure include numerous business and political leaders 
in the county.

OFFICIALS OUTLINE CURE FOR ALISO BEACH POLLUTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEN HALL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Water officials disclosed Tuesday that they will propose a natural remedy to 
the pollution that has caused popular Aliso Beach to be closed frequently over 
the decades. The cost could be $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
 At a meeting today, the Laguna Beach-based South Coast Water District will 
recommend building catch basins of native plants along Aliso Creek to trap and 
filter damaging spills before they reach the ocean, said Michael Dunbar, 
district general manager. 
</P>
<P>
 The 12-mile creek, which starts near Cooks Corner in Trabuco Canyon and 
meanders southwest to Aliso Beach, has experienced an increasing number of 
harmful spills -- sewage and urban runoff -- over the years that reach the sea 
and force beach closures. 
</P>
<P>
 The most recent happened June 20, when 16,000 gallons of partially treated 
sewage dumped into the creek reached the ocean and caused county health 
officials to bar public use of the beach for three days. So far in 1994 alone, 
the beach has been closed for 16 days because of pollution problems in the 
creek. 
</P>
<P>
 "From a water quality standpoint, the creek is a continuous problem with high 
bacterial counts every day of the year," Dunbar said. "The only reason it does 
not affect the beaches even more often is it is diluted by the ocean water." 
</P>
<P>
 He described the catch basins as a "great concept," adding, "we can deal with 
the pollution in the creek, in most cases, before it gets to the public beach." 
</P>
<P>
 Costs of the proposal, which Dunbar estimated at up to $1 million, would be 
shared by the county and the six other districts that, with South Coast, make 
up the Aliso Water Management Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 The South Coast district operates a sewage treatment plant for the agency 
along Aliso Creek, about a mile inland from Aliso Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "The sewer agencies are part of the problem but not the total problem," Dunbar 
said. "Urban runoff into the creek has been increasing over the years along 
with the development of the area." 
</P>
<P>
 Laguna Beach Mayor Ann Christoph said Tuesday that although she was only 
vaguely familiar with the South Coast proposal, she was happy that solutions 
were being sought. The city of Laguna Beach is a member of the water agency. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's certainly worth exploring and it's a step in the right 
direction," Christoph said. "We have a very bad problem. . . . If this is going 
to help clean (the creek) up, we should look at it very seriously." 
</P>
<P>
 The catch basins would have to be designed so they "fit the appearance of the 
creek," Christoph said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dunbar said the proposal calls for at least two catch basins, including a 
10-acre marsh on county land about three miles inland from Aliso Beach, and a 
smaller basin, of about four acres, in Aliso Canyon on the ocean side of the 
treatment plant. 
</P>
<P>
 The larger site is in Aliso and Wood Canyons Regional Park on land formerly 
reserved for a national fitness center promoted in the 1980s by the late 
football coach George Allen, Dunbar said. 
</P>
<P>
 The basins would use native plants that naturally filter harmful substances 
from the creek, Dunbar said. The Mission Valley Treatment Center in San Diego 
County uses a similar system, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The meeting today in which the plan will be discussed is being held by the 
Aliso Water Management Agency. Trapping Sewage 
</P>
<P>
 A South Coast Water District proposal would build catch basins along Aliso 
Creek to trap sewage before it reaches the ocean. The project could cost up to 
$1 million.

COLLEGE LIFE 101; FULLERTON CAMP TEACHES MIGRANT WORKERS' KIDS THE ABCS OF 
ACADEMIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALICIA DI RADO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There aren't many 14-year-olds who know what they'll be doing in five years, 
but Rufino Manzanares is one of them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to go to UCLA," Rufino said. "Or Cal State Fullerton. . . . I want to 
get a soccer scholarship."  
</P>
<P>
 College is a distant goal for most kids barely into their teens, and it's 
often an especially lofty dream for a migrant worker's child like Rufino. Yet 
this summer, he is getting a chance to go to college through Project BEST -- 
Basic Education Skills for Tomorrow. 
</P>
<P>
 The project invites 35 children of current or former migrant workers in Orange 
and San Diego counties to spend three weeks at Cal State Fullerton, the only 
college in the two counties to offer the program. Teen-agers -- all incoming 
high school freshmen -- take classes, play sports and live in student housing 
at University Village near campus. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of these students tend to drop out before 10th grade," said Isaac 
Cardenas, a coordinator for the 6-year-old, federally funded program. "We want 
them to set their goals high now, before high school, to give them the skills 
and desire to persevere." 
</P>
<P>
 Cardenas, chairman of the Chicano studies department at Cal State Fullerton, 
said school counselors recommend students for the program whose parents moved 
seasonally within the last five years to work in agriculture or fishing. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the students this year are from schools north of San Juan Capistrano, 
including Newport-Mesa, Orange and Placentia-Yorba Linda unified school 
districts, Cardenas said. 
</P>
<P>
 Several participants from past years now attend Cal State Fullerton, Orange 
Coast College and other local schools, he said. It costs nearly $1,300 to put 
each student through the program. 
</P>
<P>
 An academic with graying hair and a ready smile, Cardenas directs the program 
with Nancy Porras Hein, of the state Education Department's migrant education 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 "Students get a chance to see what college is all about, and find that they 
can fit in there," Hein said. 
</P>
<P>
 The program brings in students who are succeeding in school as well as others 
who need encouragement, Cardenas said. Students take classes in math, computers 
and language arts.  
</P>
<P>
 But what would college life be like without parties and sports? Cardenas said 
those aspects of campus living are also part of the program. 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent afternoon, for example, Rufino and other students kicked around a 
few soccer balls on one of the university's grass practice fields. They picked 
up soccer pointers from Jose Luis Vasquez and Andrew Molina of the Salsa, a 
team in the American Professional Soccer League that plays at Cal State 
Fullerton's Titan Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Girls and boys laughed and teased each other on the field, although most had 
only met the day before. 
</P>
<P>
 During a break in the game, Samantha Cruz, 14, said she never had 
opportunities to join a summer school or camp program before Project BEST. She 
moved to Orange County from Mexico in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm making new friends, and we share things about ourselves and we have a lot 
in common," said Samantha, of Huntington Beach. Neither Samantha nor Rufino had 
ever been on a college campus before, they added. 
</P>
<P>
 Current college students serve as advisers and counselors to the youths in the 
program. "This is a chance to help the community, and give something back as a 
university student," Cal State Fullerton senior Jose De Leon said. The advisers 
are role models, guides and friends for the teen-agers away from home. 
</P>
<P>
 Cardenas said few of the students have been away from home for long, and 
parents are wary of letting their children leave. Samantha said her parents 
approve of education -- but did they want her to spend three weeks with 34 
other teens? 
</P>
<P>
 " Welllllllll ," she said, with a shy smile. "They did finally let me come." 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers involve parents in the program, Cardenas said. They are invited to 
picnics, and teachers tell parents how students can continue their academic 
pursuits. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we find is that in general, these parents are supportive of education," 
Cardenas said, "but because they don't have educations themselves, they don't 
know the mechanics of pursuing a higher education." 
</P>
<P>
 The program also gives students a support network, Cardenas said. People often 
expect little from children of migrant workers, he said, so organizers must 
show the teen-agers that they can reach college like any other students. 
</P>
<P>
 Rufino, of Anaheim, said the program pushes him to reach his dream of college 
-- even though pressure from classmates, who don't think he should study hard, 
makes it tough to succeed in his school. 
</P>
<P>
 "In seventh grade, I got a 4.0 grade point average, so guys would say to me, 
'Hey schoolboy!' " Rufino said. "I've felt peer pressure. But I just keep on 
going."

NEIGHBORS WIN $50,175 IN LAWSUIT; COURTS: GROUP HAD HOPED A LARGER JUDGMENT 
WOULD FORCE HOMEOWNER TO MOVE. SHE HAS SAID SHE PLANS TO STAY PUT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Municipal Judge Corey Cramin has awarded $50,175 to a group of Huntington 
Harbour residents who took their neighbor to small-claims court to force her to 
clean up her property or move out. 
</P>
<P>
 David Flynn, who spearheaded the court actions, said Tuesday that members of 
his group are not entirely pleased because they fear $50,000 is not a large 
enough judgment to get Elena Zagustin to leave the upscale waterfront enclave. 
It is about half the damages sought by the neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just don't know if doing it once is going to be enough to get an end 
result," Flynn said. "It's probably not enough to get a resolution. I wish we 
could have sued for the entire value of her property in one shot." 
</P>
<P>
 Zagustin and her attorney did not return phone calls Tuesday. Her attorney 
said earlier that Zagustin, who owns several Orange County properties, has no 
intention of moving out and suggested that her neighbors do so instead. 
</P>
<P>
 Cramin's decision in the case was released Tuesday. Neighbors had adopted a 
novel court tactic called Safe Streets Now!, which was pioneered in Northern 
California to force evictions of drug-selling tenants and crack down on 
slumlords.  
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors had presented as evidence Zagustin's Huntington Beach code 
enforcement file -- the fattest in city history, including records of 21 
inspections of her house, four criminal complaints and a Superior Court lawsuit 
filed by the city that was settled last month. 
</P>
<P>
 In four hours of court testimony Monday, they told Cramin they didn't think 
Zagustin is capable of maintaining her property, and complained she had caused 
them emotional harm by hoarding rubbish, making noise late at night and 
creating a health hazard that brought vermin and unbearable odors to the 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 "If she puts a for sale sign on that house, the day it closes escrow we'll 
give her all her money back," Flynn said. "We don't want the money." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In court Monday, Zagustin told the judge that she had cleaned up her property 
in accordance with court order issued last month in a case brought by the city 
of Huntington Beach. She also denied many of the allegations of her neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview Monday, she also vowed to sue her neighbors for malicious 
prosecution and intentional infliction of emotional distress. 
</P>
<P>
 The two dozen neighbors, three of them minors, each sought $5,000 from 
Zagustin, the maximum obtainable in small-claims court. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than the $120,000 they had requested, Cramin consolidated claims filed 
by husbands and wives and reduced the judgments of the minors. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge also denied the claims of two young men who had moved several years 
ago from their parents' Huntington Harbour home next door to Zagustin. Cramin 
said the statute of limitations on emotional distress is one year. 
</P>
<P>
 Nine couples received $5,000 each; the grown daughter of one couple who have 
lived next door to Zagustin for 19 years received $2,500; the three small 
children of another couple, one of whom told Cramin on Monday that Zagustin had 
chased her down the street, received $500 each, and Flynn's father received 
$500. 
</P>
<P>
 Cramin also awarded the group $675 in legal costs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am disappointed," Flynn said. "I don't think it is enough." 
</P>
<P>
 He vowed to rally more neighbors and take Zagustin back to court in 100 days 
if the property is not cleaned up. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're using this as a means to an end," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our only recourse is to get enough judgments against her to get her to move 
or to clean up," Flynn added. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The tactic of teaming up in small-claims court in the hopes of winning large 
judgments against problem property owners was pioneered by an Oakland resident 
in 1989, and Safe Streets Now! has since helped Bay Area residents win more 
than $760,000 in judgments. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach activist Betsy Bredau, who has launched a Safe Streets Now! office 
in her city, has helped residents there win $56,000 in judgments against 
property owners in the past year with the same tactic; she helped Flynn and his 
neighbors with their case. 
</P>
<P>
 Flynn said he hoped the judgments, mailed to plaintiffs Tuesday, would inspire 
residents elsewhere to act. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are happy . . . with the fact that the tactic worked," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Safe Streets Now!'s phone is probably ringing off the damn hook 
today, because every neighborhood has an Elena," he said. "It only takes one 
house to ruin three or four blocks. It's one bad apple spoils the barrel." 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana activist Jim Walker, who has been trained in the Safe Streets Now! 
tactics, said the judgments set a precedent in Orange County and could be a 
significant tool in battling slumlords and crack houses. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is historic. This was not about money. This was about winning, this was 
about finding that the system does work, and now neighbors can expect a 
healthier and safer neighborhood," Walker said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do believe that this could really make a safer Orange County. We all win 
for this."

DANA PARSONS: DENYING RESPONSIBILITY SEEMS TO BE PAR FOR THE COURSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Dana Parsons 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 To Susan and Bob Wilmot, the answer to who's responsible for denting Susan's 
1991 Honda with an errant tee shot is crystal clear. 
</P>
<P>
 To golf course manager Joe Cannon, the answer is also crystal clear. 
</P>
<P>
 It's just that they have totally different answers. And somewhere in the 
middle of it all is a silver-haired man owning a shirt with a diagonal stripe 
who needs golf lessons. 
</P>
<P>
 Add to the list of Life's Vexing Questions the following: If you're driving 
down a major public street and your car is plunked by a golf ball from the 
adjacent golf course, who should pay for any damages? Is it: 
</P>
<P>
 A) The golfer who hit the shot? 
</P>
<P>
 B) The golf course management? 
</P>
<P>
 C) The driver of the car? 
</P>
<P>
 Susan Wilmot, eight months pregnant at the time, was driving on Edinger Avenue 
in Fountain Valley last September when a golf ball from the David Baker Golf 
Center struck the hood of her car, denting it. Startled and upset, she pulled 
over and telephoned her husband. But because she had seen a foursome looking 
out into the street, she saw who hit the shot and pulled into the golf course 
parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
 She said the employees in the pro shop told her the course management wouldn't 
reimburse her, but someone from the pro shop volunteered to drive her in a cart 
onto the course to confront the foursome. She spied a silver-haired man as the 
culprit but, according to Wilmot, "he said he didn't know anything about it." 
</P>
<P>
 She let them go but, alternately crying and calm, approached them again a few 
minutes later. Eventually, she said, the silver-haired man said he'd admit 
striking the blow but only if the golf course management or his insurance would 
cover the damages. That conversation ended, however, as his playing partner 
prodded him to continue their game, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, golf course officials reiterated to the Wilmots that any damage was 
the golfer's responsibility. Wilmot reasoned it was the golf course's 
responsibility because it hadn't erected a substantial enough protective fence 
or some other obstruction between the course and Edinger. 
</P>
<P>
 Huntington Beach residents when the incident occurred, the Wilmots have since 
moved to Nevada, but in a phone conversation Tuesday Wilmot dismissed 
suggestions that his wife -- or anyone in a similar situation -- has a 
responsibility to track down the golfer: "What if you have a major traffic 
accident (from a ball hitting a car) and you can't get to the course? There's 
got to be some ultimate responsibility taken somewhere." 
</P>
<P>
 The only logical place, he contends, is with the course management. He 
reasoned that the course is a business that charges people to play there and 
that it has responsibility for damages that result from the business. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wilmots filed a claim with American Golf Corp., which operates the course, 
but it was rejected. They also filed a claim with Orange County government, 
which leases the land to the golf company, but the county also ash-canned it. 
</P>
<P>
 The repair job cost $491.19, which the Wilmots paid. "I really don't have the 
time and energy to go to Small Claims Court over $500," Bob Wilmot said. 
Because the amount was less than their deductible, the Wilmots couldn't file an 
insurance claim. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, over at the golf course, manager Joe Cannon said it's unreasonable 
to hold course operators responsible for bad golfers. Just as a golfer is 
responsible for hitting someone on the course with an errant shot, so should 
the golfer be accountable for hitting someone off the course, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 That would mean 'fessing up when someone confronted them with a bill for car 
repair. Given that golfers are all too willing to claim a 6 when they shot a 7, 
I wonder about the likelihood of owning up to financial liability. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyway, I asked Cannon how reasonable it is to expect a pedestrian or driver 
to come to the course and find someone on the fairway whose ball struck them, 
as Susan Wilmot did. "It's very realistic to find the golfer if a person comes 
in immediately," Cannon said. "It's unfortunate that he generally doesn't want 
to admit it, that he hit a shot that bad. It's extremely difficult (to get them 
to confess) unless the guy is above board." 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, Cannon said, it's not fair to stick the liability with the golf 
course management. 
</P>
<P>
 A hundred people a day play the course, he said, creating 100 potential 
hazardous drives onto the street. "We have no knowledge how good or bad he is 
when he comes to pay the greens fee. There's no requirement that he must be 
able to play, and even if he's a good player, this occurs. So as a consequence, 
I don't see how anyone could say that the course should be responsible." 
</P>
<P>
 Why not build a large fence, as some courses have, when a fairway runs near a 
street? Cannon said he once worked at a course that put up a 40-foot-high fence 
and "it doesn't do a bit of good in the world. If someone has hit a ball that 
poorly, it goes over the fence anyway." 
</P>
<P>
 The good news is that things like this apparently don't happen often. In his 3 
1/2 years at Baker, Cannon said maybe 15 people have come to complain about 
golf ball damage. 
</P>
<P>
 To his knowledge, he said, no golfer on the course has ever confessed to 
hitting the stray shot.

VIDEO STIRS BRUTALITY ALLEGATIONS; VIOLENCE: TV STATION AIRS TAPE OF COMPTON 
OFFICER BEATING YOUTH DURING JULY 29 ARREST. POLICE DEPARTMENT WILL CALL ON 
D.A.'S OFFICE TO CONDUCT A 'CONCURRENT, INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATION' OF THE 
INCIDENT.

<P>
 A home video aired Tuesday by a local television station stirred allegations 
of police brutality with footage of a burly Compton police officer beating a 
17-year-old youth who had confronted him during an investigation of child 
neglect at the youth's home. 
</P>
<P>
 Compton police said they already had launched an internal investigation into 
the July 29 arrest of the 17-year-old youth, who had complained about the 
arrest. However, said Capt. Steven Roller, the department was unaware the tape 
had been made until they saw it on KNBC-TV Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the video, Roller said, the department will contact the Los Angeles 
County district attorney's office today to request that it conduct a 
"concurrent, independent investigation of the arrest and surrounding events." 
</P>
<P>
 The tape -- apparently made by a neighbor without the officer's knowledge at 
the trailer park where the teen-ager lives -- shows the officer smacking the 
youth on the side of the head with his police baton, pummeling him with baton 
blows after he has collapsed to the ground, jumping on the back of the much 
smaller teen-ager to handcuff him and then using the baton to drag the youth 
across the ground by his handcuff chain. 
</P>
<P>
 Compton police would not comment on the details of the arrest. 
</P>
<P>
 Humberto Guizar, an attorney representing the youth and his mother, Enriqueta 
de la Cruz, said the boy's family plans to file a civil rights suit against the 
police. 
</P>
<P>
 "The officer beat this guy, totally contrary to what he says in the (police) 
report," Guizar said. "In the report he says my client struck him, fought with 
him, that he subdued him and arrested him without incident. I think that when 
this comes out in court, the jury will see that that's just not true." 
</P>
<P>
 Guizar said the youth argued with the officer because "someone from Children's 
Services wanted to take his sisters away. He asked the officer if he had a 
warrant, and got hit in the face." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, another lawyer who specializes in police brutality and who viewed 
the unedited tape said he was "flabbergasted" by the conduct of the policeman, 
whom he identified as Officer Michael Jackson. Compton police would not confirm 
that identification nor provide any information about the officer involved 
except to say that he is still an employee of the department. 
</P>
<P>
 The video, the lawyer said, shows numerous violations of the law regarding 
police use of force, including the illegal blow to the head.  
</P>
<P>
 "This was completely out to lunch in terms of what this officer was doing to 
this kid," said attorney Thomas E. Beck, who viewed the tape at the request of 
KNBC, but who has no other interest in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 "Especially since the kid was not being arrested -- the officer had been 
called there to back up a social worker who was there to take (the youth and 
his siblings) from the house as latchkey children," Beck said. 
</P>
<P>
 The claim, he said, was that "the adult who was supposed to be supervising 
them was at work, and they weren't being supervised." 
</P>
<P>
 Compton police confirmed that the officer had been called to the house to back 
up a Department of Children's Services worker investigating reports of child 
neglect. The youth, police said, was arrested and is still in custody. However, 
they would not say whether charges had been filed against him. 
</P>
<P>
 Maria Quintana, identified by KNBC as the youth's godmother, said she was 
called to the home by her godchildren, and arrived just as the social worker 
was rounding them up to take them away. 
</P>
<P>
 Quintana told the TV station that her godson, had confronted the officer and 
the social worker, but had not made any physical threat. 
</P>
<P>
 "The police officer said on his report that (the youth) had threatened the 
social worker, which (is) not true, then that he tried to take the gun away 
from the police officer when he told him to put his hands behind the back," 
Quintana said. 
</P>
<P>
 Quintana said her godson never went for the officer's gun.  
</P>
<P>
 "Felipe just asked, 'Why?"' she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Another witness, identified as Carla Gavina, said the youth had argued with 
the officer, but did not threaten him. 
</P>
<P>
 "He did give him attitude, probably a reason for the police officer, not to 
hit him the way he did, but yet to provoke him a little bit," Gavina told the 
television station. 
</P>
<P>
 The tape does not capture the discussions that led up to the confrontation but 
begins with several seconds of quiet before the officer suddenly delivers a 
barrage of blows to the youth with his baton.

LET'S TALK TURKEY: NATION IS HOOKED ON HOT LINES; COMMUNICATIONS: ONCE USED 
MAINLY FOR EMERGENCY HELP, THE PHONE SERVICES NOW TAKE TIPS FROM THE PUBLIC AND 
OFFER ADVICE ON EVERYTHING FROM PANTS TO PORK CHOPS.

 O.J. Simpson has one. So does the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. 
</P>
<P>
 But even if you're not trying to catch the "real killer or killers" -- or 
catch a bus during a transit strike -- it's more than likely that a toll-free 
telephone hot line is available to suit your needs. 
</P>
<P>
 Swallow some boric acid and need an emergency antidote? Phone the Poison 
Control Center. Curious about the safe temperature for baking a pork chop? Call 
the federal Meat and Poultry Hotline. Spot an erratically steered big-rig on 
the Santa Monica Freeway? Dial the 1 (800) 'How Am I Driving' number displayed 
above the 18-wheeler's rear mud flap. 
</P>
<P>
 Is there any doubt that America is hot line crazy? Consider the fact that 
there are two competing toll-free phone lines sponsored by firms selling 
tablets to break down the indigestible gas-causing sugars found in beans. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "In the beginning, when they said 'hot line,' it was exactly what it meant -- 
a place you'd call if you were in trouble and there'd be someone on the end of 
the line who could give you assistance, referrals and direction," said Andrea 
Thompson Adam, hot line coordinator for the Los Angeles Commission on Assaults 
Against Women. "These days, the term hot line is being taken for granted as 
anything you can get information on -- including where to buy cars, shoes and 
furniture." 
</P>
<P>
 In the Simpson case, attorneys for the celebrity murder defendant say they've 
received more than 250,000 calls on a toll-free tip hot line set up less than 
two weeks ago to seek exculpatory evidence. In the case of the transit strike, 
a second "800" phone line offering recorded information was established after 
callers inundated the MTA's regular transit hot line with an estimated 15,000 
calls on the first day of the walkout. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the volume of calls on those highly publicized phone lines is but a 
fraction of that generated by toll-free hot lines nationally. 
</P>
<P>
 On any given business day, about 1.4 million calls go through to "800" hot 
lines serviced by AT&T alone, according to phone company officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "With an '800' number, you can cover the entire nation, or a region, a state 
or even a specific area code," said AT&T spokesman Monty Hoyt. "For businesses, 
hot lines are a very important immediate contact with their customers. They can 
find out instantly whether they have a big success on their hands or a lemon 
they can change before it's too late." 
</P>
<P>
 Although consumer hot lines are now a staple for firms ranging from clothing 
manufacturers to turkey farmers, the roots of the phenomenon are far removed 
from the everyday world of merchandising. 
</P>
<P>
 The first known use of the term hot line, according to etymologists and 
telephone historians, was in the mid-1950s in connection with government 
emergency communications equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 The best-known hot line of this sort was the teletype circuitry installed in 
1963 linking the White House and Kremlin to avoid any misunderstanding that 
could result in nuclear conflagration. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On a more personal scale, the first public telephone hot lines were operated 
by volunteer-staffed crisis intervention centers, providing instant assistance 
to people contemplating suicide or teetering on the edges of reality during bad 
LSD trips. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the earliest such lines were those run by the Los Angeles-based Poison 
Control and Suicide Prevention Centers, both of which kicked off service in the 
late 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the time," recalls registered nurse Frances Weindler, who has served at 
the poison center for 35 years, "we didn't have an '800' number because they 
didn't exist." 
</P>
<P>
 With the advent of toll-free service in the late 1960s and the subsequent 
technological revolution that allowed organizations to operate a single 
nationwide "800" listing, the numbers and range of hot line services exploded. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the longer-lasting lines are those operated by the U.S. Consumer Product 
Safety Commission, the Whirlpool and General Electric corporations, the 
American Cancer Society and the American Heart Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Emergencies have created their own need for hot lines, such as the ongoing 
Northridge earthquake disaster assistance line operated by federal 
representatives. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there are seasonal services such as the Butterball Turkey Talk-Line, 
which answers consumer questions each November and December on the thawing, 
cooking and carving of holiday fowl. 
</P>
<P>
 Turkey Talk-Line spokeswoman Beth Day would not directly address why the 
service is available only two months a year, whereas other meat-related lines 
are staffed 12 months a year by pork producers and the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't really comment except to say that the Turkey Talk-Line has always 
traditionally been open in November and December -- although we're seeing an 
increase in turkey consumption year-round." 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1992 presidential primary campaign, former California Gov. Edmund G. 
(Jerry) Brown Jr. took the concept of the hot line into the political arena, 
turning himself into a walking pitchman for his "800" number to raise funds for 
his race against then-Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 There have even been hot lines created by corporations in connection with 
court settlements of ethics violations cases. The B. Manischewitz Co. Ethics 
Hotline was established after the New Jersey-based firm pleaded no contest to 
an indictment charging it with conspiring to fix the price of Passover matzo. 
</P>
<P>
 Manischewitz compliance officer Jim Esposito said last week that no improper 
business practices have been reported to the company over the hot line in the 
past 18 months. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got some calls, but (mainly) just hang-ups," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In general, however, hot lines are so popular that one San Diego entrepreneur 
pays thousands of dollars a month in phone bills for the use of about 250 
"vanity" numbers -- "800" numbers that spell something (such as 800-HOMELES) -- 
which he can then sublet for profits. 
</P>
<P>
 Many hot lines, in keeping with tradition, are answered by live operators. But 
others offer only a recorded message and an opportunity for callers to leave 
their own taped messages. 
</P>
<P>
 The latter is true for the O.J. Simpson tip hot line, as well as the National 
Hotline for Sexual Addiction based in Wickenburg, Ariz. For whatever reason, 
calls to the sexual addiction line went unanswered for a day and a half last 
week, until the director himself returned a reporter's inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't have enough help available to have people man the phones," Ron 
Arrington explained, saying his line was designed more to provide information 
than crisis intervention. 
</P>
<P>
 In many cases, hot lines give callers the opportunity to remain anonymous, a 
key factor in their unceasing popularity. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basic research shows that people self-disclose more on the telephone than in 
person," said USC communication professor A. Michael Noll. "The electronic 
distance allows more personal verbal intimacy. . . . The fact you're physically 
anonymous gives you a sense of being more secure and hence you can disclose 
more." 
</P>
<P>
 Adding to the allure is the fact that phoning an "800" number is free to 
callers -- although organizations that have the numbers generally pay 15 cents 
to 25 cents a minute for the calls they receive, according to AT&T. 
</P>
<P>
 The most essential toll-free line is actually a non-800 number: 911, for 
police, fire and paramedic emergency assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the most elementary of hot lines," AT&T's Hoyt said. "Most kids from age 
3 are programmed to use it." 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles, dozens, if not hundreds, of hot lines for personal and social 
problems are available -- and over the years the services provided have become 
increasingly specialized. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pacific Bell Smart Yellow Pages community directory lists "800" numbers 
for mental health centers, AIDS information, missing children sightings, 
emergency shelter and food programs, drug dependency, foster care and statewide 
self-help referrals to support groups, among others. Many organizations offer 
further specialized services to Spanish speakers and the deaf. 
</P>
<P>
 For battering victims alone, there are about 20 hot lines in Los Angeles 
County. 
</P>
<P>
 The specialization can help nip some problems in the bud, experts say. For 
example, a troubled youth who gets help from a teen line or a youth crisis line 
may never become depressed enough to dial the Suicide Prevention Center. 
</P>
<P>
 But public funding of crisis lines has declined significantly since the Reagan 
era and its budget cuts began in the early 1980s, experts say. In recent years, 
some hot lines have gone out of business and others have had trouble hanging 
on. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 One of the worst crises for Southern California crisis centers came in 1992 
when the underfunded Orange County Poison Center folded and the Los Angeles 
Poison Control Center, which now handles Orange County queries as well as those 
from six other Southern California counties, almost shut down as well. The Los 
Angeles facility was finally saved by linking up with an existing drug 
information center at Los Angeles County-USC Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Suicide Prevention Center, once a stand-alone agency with $1.3 
million in annual county funding, now receives one-tenth that amount and 
remains in business only because it has come under the umbrella of Family 
Service of Los Angeles, according to center director Jay Nagdimon. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency's budget is so tight that it cannot even afford an "800" line, 
Nagdimon said, forcing callers from much of the county to pay toll charges. 
Because of a shortage of volunteers, he added, the hot line is not always 
adequately staffed. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, one afternoon last week, a caller got a busy signal when repeatedly 
dialing the suicide hot line number for nearly two hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Nagdimon conceded that the inability to get through on the hot line is a 
serious problem, but the only advice he could offer was: "People need to have 
patience and keep trying and we'll get to them as soon as we can." 
</P>
<P>
 A concern of traditional hot line centers is the proliferation of agencies 
with "800" numbers that serve primarily as intake vehicles for addiction 
treatment centers rather than as crisis intervention services. 
</P>
<P>
 "For-profit hospitals use these '800' counseling numbers as a front," Nagdimon 
said. "It's really unfortunate, because we can't compete with them." 
</P>
<P>
 One for-profit health firm based in Ventura County has 18 separate "800" hot 
lines coming into the same facility for problems including alcohol and drug 
abuse, suicidal feelings, sexual trauma, eating disorders, post-traumatic 
stress disorder and depression. 
</P>
<P>
 "You name it, we can treat it for you," said Michelle Towers, a spokeswoman 
for Primary Health Management Systems. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Towers said the same phone counselors are responsible for handling incoming 
calls on all the firm's hot lines, which are listed in phone directories under 
such headings as Suicide Intervention or Drug Abuse and Assistance Help Line 
and Hospital Referrals. 
</P>
<P>
 Towers said the firm's counselors "have an overall kind of training" and are 
trained to refer callers to the intake department for the company's Anacapa by 
the Sea multi-addiction and mental health center in Port Hueneme. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted '800' lines so people nationwide could contact us," Towers said "So 
we bought out several '800' numbers. 
</P>
<P>
 "If (callers) have insurance or can pay cash, we try to see if we can help 
them get into Anacapa. If they have no income whatsoever, we try to refer them 
to places in their state or county run by the county where they can get help 
for no money or a small amount." Informing the Public 
</P>
<P>
 Years ago, hot lines almost exclusively provided emergency assistance, 
referrals and direction. Now they dispense information and serve as tip lines 
for issues and businesses of all sorts. Among the kinds of lines: 
</P>
<P>
 * National Hot Line for Sexual Addiction, provides information and referrals 
for the sexually compulsive. (800) 321-2066 
</P>
<P>
 * Butterball Turkey Talk Line, open each November and December to answer 
questions on how to prepare a holiday turkey. (800) 323-4848 
</P>
<P>
 * B. Manischewitz Co. Ethics Hot Line, to report complaints about possible 
improper business practices by employees of the matzo-making giant. (800) 
424-6266 
</P>
<P>
 * National HIV and AIDS Hot Line, provides information on how the deadly 
disease is transmitted and the addresses of testing centers. (800) 342-2437

REVEL ROUSTERS; COURTS: THE CITY FILES SUIT TO STOP PARTIES AT A STUDIO CITY 
MANSION AFTER NEIGHBORS COMPLAIN OF NOISE, PUBLIC SEX AND DRUG SALES. THE 
TENANT VOWS TO FIGHT FOR HIS FAST TIMES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 To Jerry Bolduc, the mansion that he and his friends rent in the hills above 
Studio City is his castle -- one primo party palace with a hot tub, five 
bedrooms, a sea of king-size mattresses and a sand-filled volleyball pit by the 
pool. 
</P>
<P>
 To neighbors and the Los Angeles city attorney's office, it is a public 
nuisance -- where up to 1,000 people at a time paid admission to join in 
revels-for-hire that on at least one occasion were televised on MTV. 
</P>
<P>
 And so, it soon could be last call at the house on Wrightwood Drive. The city 
attorney's office filed suit Tuesday in Los Angeles Superior Court against the 
estate's owners and tenants, seeking an injunction that would say, in legal 
terms: "The party's over." 
</P>
<P>
 But Bolduc, who said he has a pay phone business, vows to fight for his right 
to party. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically, we spend a lot of money here to lease a big house so we can have 
parties," he said in a poolside interview, a portable phone at his side and a 
sweeping view of the San Fernando Valley as his backdrop. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anybody who buys this kind of house is going to want to entertain," said 
Bolduc, who prefers to be called "Jerry Bo." "I'm not a rock star. Things could 
be a whole lot worse." 
</P>
<P>
 The city attorney's suit alleges, however, that not all the parties were 
private. At times, court documents say, the estate was used illegally for 
commercial purposes -- so-called "underground" parties, advertised in flyers, 
at which revelers were charged $15 at the door, and liquor was sold without a 
license. 
</P>
<P>
 If the city prevails in court, property owner Paul Campbell, property manager 
Steven Powers and tenants Bolduc and Michael Dupre could all be fined, jailed 
or both. 
</P>
<P>
 For the past four years, City Atty. James Hahn alleged, the $2.1-million 
bluff-top mansion has been Party Central. Up to 1,000 people at a time flocked 
to the bashes and they weren't the most well-behaved group, the lawsuit 
alleges. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors have lodged more than 100 complaints with police about "property 
damage, thefts, drug sales, sex acts occurring in public, excessive noise and 
severe traffic and parking congestion," Deputy City Atty. Deborah Sanchez said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was once a peaceful neighborhood," Sanchez said. "There had to be an end 
because these tenants really crossed the line." 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors contend that their potted plants have been pilfered and their 
driveways blocked, and that passionate party-goers indulged themselves poolside 
in plain view. Party trash has been left in the driveway, only to become 
infested with maggots, Sanchez said. 
</P>
<P>
 And then there's the noise, the complaint alleges -- music and screaming at 
all hours of the night. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have had party-goers urinate in our bushes . . . and light up marijuana 
joints in our driveway," neighbors Margot and Cliff Lachman said in a court 
declaration. "We have observed the sale of drugs directly in front of our 
home," said Richard and Patti Kimball. 
</P>
<P>
 Court records indicate that the mansion in the 3200 block of Wrightwood Drive 
is the most complained-about residence in the Los Angeles Police Department's 
North Hollywood division. In court documents, Sgt. Charles Wampler called it 
"an ongoing and habitual police problem." 
</P>
<P>
 On May 6, the suit says, undercover police officers attended a party at the 
house and bought drinks at three bars. They issued seven citations for selling 
alcohol without a license to the bartenders. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The city's suit alleges that the underground parties violate liquor laws and 
building and safety codes and sometimes lead to violence, city attorney 
spokesman Mike Qualls said. 
</P>
<P>
 Qualls added that Tuesday's suit was the first abatement case that he had seen 
filed against a private residence for underground parties, which usually are 
held in commercial buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 Bolduc said Tuesday that the allegations had been trumped up by overzealous 
police officers and spiteful neighbors. He said that since he moved in eight 
months ago, he has been made to pay for the sins of past tenants. 
</P>
<P>
 The house already was notorious when "gangsta" rapper Dr. Dre hosted a 
birthday bash there early this year that was carried on MTV, he said. Bolduc 
says party-pooper police towed about 100 cars that night. 
</P>
<P>
 He says his friends have been harassed by police. Once, he said, officers 
climbed up the bluff and hid in the bushes, frightening a guest who let out a 
bloodcurdling shriek at the sight of armed men by the pool. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem isn't me," he said. "I'm just a working guy trying to get ahead 
and enjoy the summer in a nice place." 
</P>
<P>
 And so what, he asks, if the city attorney doesn't approve of some of his 
party themes, such as "Lingerie Night," at which young women were admitted free 
if they wore lingerie. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's against the law about having a lingerie party?" he asked. "I've been 
going to pajama parties since I was 8 years old." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll admit to living a bachelor lifestyle," Bolduc said while conducting a 
tour of the 7,500-square-foot house. There was barely a stick of furniture 
downstairs: A couple of couches, draped with blankets. A pool table. Here and 
there, an empty beer can or a cheap art print. 
</P>
<P>
 He headed up the sweeping staircase and toward the master bedroom. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the jungle, the lair of Jerry Bo," he said, proudly showing off a 
huge boudoir, complete with a Jacuzzi that offers a view of Universal Studios, 
all the way to the Griffith Observatory. A lone goldfish inhabited the 
aquarium. Magazines featuring photos of unclothed women were strewn on one of 
the four king-size mattresses lined up against one wall. The beds were draped 
in the same camouflage parachute material that balloons from the ceiling and 
were surrounded by Army-green beanbag chairs. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's 35 feet long, including the beanbags," Bolduc said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll admit to having sex here," he said. "I'm guilty of that. But we 
emphatically deny that we have broken any laws here."

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; CITY'S 
ANTI-GRAFFITI EFFORTS CONSOLIDATED INTO 1 AGENCY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council on Tuesday designated one agency to manage all anti-graffiti 
programs currently run by several departments and offices. 
</P>
<P>
 Operation Clean Sweep, an arm of the Department of Public Works, will oversee 
all contracts with community organizations chosen to provide abatement 
services. 
</P>
<P>
 The consolidation is aimed at preventing duplication of efforts and ensuring 
that no group can receive multiple contracts from various agencies to clean up 
the same area.  
</P>
<P>
 "It has the potential to be a problem," said Delphia Jones, director of 
Operation Clean Sweep. "And frankly, we don't know because it hasn't been 
consolidated under one umbrella." 
</P>
<P>
 At this time, graffiti removal programs are spread throughout the city 
bureaucracy, including the mayor's office, the port, the Community 
Redevelopment Agency, and the Departments of Water and Power, Airports and 
Community Development.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; 
YAROSLAVSKY URGES INTERIM COUNCIL MEMBER FOR HIS JOB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Worried that his constituency will be without a leader, departing Los Angeles 
City Council member Zev Yaroslavsky said this week that an interim lawmaker 
should be appointed when he steps down from his council post in December to 
join the county Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 Yaroslavsky said he fears that a leaderless period -- which could last as long 
as seven months -- would hurt critical efforts to put earthquake-battered 
Sherman Oaks back on its feet."That's the risk," the 5th District council 
member said during an interview this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Yaroslavksy has been receptive to the idea of establishing a redevelopment 
project in Sherman Oaks to finance the rebuilding effort, a move that would be 
enormously complicated. 
</P>
<P>
 An interim council member -- who Yaroslavksy said must have no long-term 
political ambitions -- could protect 5th District interests and possibly deter 
other council members from stripping the district of resources, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Yaroslavsky leaves city office on Dec. 5 after serving 19 years. After that, 
District 5 residents would be without representation until mid-1995, the 
earliest date when a successor to Yaroslavsky could be elected to his seat. 
Yaroslavsky's four-year term ends on June 30, 1997.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; MAN HELD 
IN EXECUTION-STYLE KILLING OF 14-YEAR-OLD BOY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 22-year-old Los Angeles man has been arrested in connection with the 
execution-style murder of a 14-year-old boy and the attempted murder of a 
19-year-old man, FBI and sheriff's department officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Arturo Pineda Borboa was taken into custody Monday by a multi-agency unit made 
up of sheriff's deputies and agents from the FBI and the California Department 
of Justice.Since October, 1992, the unit -- known as GAT, for Gangster 
Apprehension Team -- has arrested 300 suspects wanted for violent crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 An FBI spokesman said that Borboa was in a group that drove up to the victims 
in East Los Angeles and opened fire. He is accused of shooting the 19-year-old 
in the back and then walking over to the 14-year-old, who was hiding behind a 
car, and shooting him several times. 
</P>
<P>
 After getting back into his car, Borboa backed up over the 19-year-old before 
fleeing, investigators said. "This was an outrageous crime in which a group of 
gang members essentially went on a mission of violence," said Charlie J. 
Parsons, special agent in charge of the FBI's Los Angeles office.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: IRWINDALE; BREWER MAY 
HAVE TO REPLY ON RECYCLED WASTE WATER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Beer made from recycled sewer water may not sound too tasty, but the Miller 
Brewing Co. plant in Irwindale may have to start making it. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller has been accused of stalling on a $25-million water reclamation project 
proposed by water district officials in the San Gabriel Valley because the idea 
of beer made from reclaimed sewer water sounds bad. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller officials say they think the process could be dangerous and requires 
more research. Miller uses 869 million gallons of water each year to make beer 
at its Irwindale plant. 
</P>
<P>
 On July 20, the board of directors for the Upper San Gabriel Valley Municipal 
Water District approved an environmental impact study for an underground 
pipeline to transport the reclaimed water from a sewage plant in Whittier to 
spreading grounds in Irwindale. The water then will drip down to the ground 
water, from which the district draws much of its drinking supplies. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller has delayed the project for a year by swamping water district officials 
with questions that they are required to answer about its effect on the 
environment and the public. 
</P>
<P>
 But now that the environmental issue has been resolved, the brewer will either 
have to sue or accept the sewage. 
</P>
<P>
 Company attorneys said they are considering going to court. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have scientists who say it's dangerous and they have scientists who say 
it's not," said Michael Brophy, a spokesman at Miller corporate headquarters in 
Milwaukee. "We're erring on the side of caution." 
</P>
<P>
 But Jim Goodrich, executive director of the San Gabriel Basin Water Quality 
Authority, which oversees the cleanup of the basin's pollutants, says the 
region will need the water now devoted to beer for other uses in the future. 
"It's hogwash that this is a health issue," Goodrich said. "Reclaimed water is 
cleaner than storm water." 
</P>
<P>
 Treated water from the Whittier plant already is pumped into homes in 43 
cities. The Upper San Gabriel Valley Municipal Water District serves 1 million 
residents in 18 cities. It imports 25% of its water from Northern California 
and the Colorado River. Water officials say the northern supply will be harder 
to count on as more water gets held back for environmental reasons.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO; PASSION FOR MAKING OLD APPEAR NEW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF BEAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 W. E. (Bill) Hardy walked into his cramped hobby studio, his cowboy boots 
flattening the dust beneath his feet. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, this is the junk room," the 74-year-old, World War II fighter pilot 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 He was only joking about "junk." 
</P>
<P>
 A restored camera more than 100 years old sits in one corner. A 1905 Edison 
phonograph is next to a glass case stuffed with antique tools. A display of 
vintage saws on a wall forms an arc. And two 150-year-old barometers in need of 
repair await Hardy's calloused and careful hands. 
</P>
<P>
 "This one here is worth eight grand," Hardy said, pointing to one of the 
barometers picked up by a Newport Beach gallery owner at a London auction. "I 
think these are the new popular thing for interior decorators." 
</P>
<P>
 Tinkering with everything from cars driven to burger joints in the mid-1950s 
to sextants used by sailors to navigate the seas in the 1880s, Hardy has made 
restoration a passion. 
</P>
<P>
 When he gets bored with a particular item, he turns his attention to something 
else. These days, old radios, he said, look like an attractive challenge. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the past decade, the board vice president of the San Juan Capistrano 
Historical Society has restored hundreds of items, some of which remain in his 
shop. Other things, such as antique telescopes, were specially refurbished for 
collectors. 
</P>
<P>
 "I change from month to month," Hardy said of his interests. "I guess the 
bottom line is, I have a short attention span for a certain commodity. Once I 
learn about something and how to restore it, I move on." 
</P>
<P>
 Hardy stopped renovating automobiles for reasons other than boredom. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were hard on the knuckles," he said of vehicles and the wrench work 
needed to dismantle and reassemble them. 
</P>
<P>
 In his work, whenever he can, Hardy duplicates parts that have been broken by 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 After retiring in 1984 as a logistics manager at what is now Rockwell, Hardy 
took his hobby more seriously. He said he spends about four to five hours on it 
a day. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Hardy took some college courses when younger, he never received a 
formal degree. But that hardly matters. 
</P>
<P>
 Will he ever run out of items to restore? 
</P>
<P>
 "I've got lots of things to go, if I live long enough," Hardy said. JEFF BEAN

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ANAHEIM; AIR AMBULANCE RETURNS TO COUNTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN MILLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Though he has clearance to curb it on the freeways, Jack Delahanty sometimes 
still has trouble finding a place to park. 
</P>
<P>
 With every minute crucial to his passengers, the 44-year-old air ambulance 
pilot from Yorba Linda doesn't have time to squander looking for a spot. 
Locating a 75-by-75-foot space from 500 feet at night while avoiding trees and 
electrical wires during a medical emergency can be a formidable challenge -- 
even for a Vietnam combat helicopter veteran, who now is a pilot for Mercy Air 
Services Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 Mercy Air, a privately owned air ambulance company, returned to Orange County 
last month, re-establishing itself as the only such service in the county. 
</P>
<P>
 Mercy Air left the county last year because of an insurance dispute with state 
authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 The state Department of Health Services last year slashed Medi-Cal 
reimbursements for air ambulance transportation by 60%, which dealt a serious 
financial blow to many medical helicopter operators. 
</P>
<P>
 After Mercy Air began operating out of Rialto Airport, 12 minutes from the 
Orange County line, county fire departments reported rarely calling on the air 
ambulance service. 
</P>
<P>
 But Mercy Air streamlined its operations over the past year, buying 
cost-efficient helicopters. The move allowed it to open a new base at the North 
Net Training Center, across from Anaheim Stadium. It formerly operated from UCI 
Medical Center in Orange. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're glad to be back in Orange County," said Mary Davis, a Mercy Air 
spokeswoman. "Orange County is so densely populated, our ships are definitely 
being used there." 
</P>
<P>
 In July, Mercy Air's copter flew into action, parking in the Alpha Beta 
shopping center at Brookhurst Street and Ball Road to airlift a seriously 
injured teen-ager to a trauma center after a two-car collision. 
</P>
<P>
 "There (are) a lot of short bursts of high stress," said Jody Haynes, a Mercy 
Air flight nurse. 
</P>
<P>
 The crew, consisting of pilot, nurse and paramedic, can be dressed in flight 
gear and en route to an accident scene within five minutes of receiving a call. 
A crew may handle up to seven calls in a 24-hour shift. 
</P>
<P>
 The minutes saved by air transport can mean the difference between life and 
death, medical officials say. Depending on traffic and distance, the helicopter 
can shave 15 to 20 minutes off the time it would take an ambulance to take a 
patient to a medical facility. 
</P>
<P>
 "The faster we can get a patient to surgery," said Tim Smith, a 27-year-old 
Mercy Air flight medic, "the more likely it is there will be a positive 
outcome." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to rescuing accident victims, Mercy Air's missions also involve 
patient transfers between medical facilities and transporting medical teams. 
</P>
<P>
 Mercy Air uses a Bell 222-U helicopter, which has a top speed of 173 m.p.h. 
The craft can carry two patients and a three-person crew and can fly up to 400 
nautical miles. MARTIN MILLER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; BOARD CHECKING OUT LIBRARY MAINTENANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Orange County Board of Supervisors, worried that the financially troubled 
library system could fall into disrepair, Tuesday asked for a review of 
maintenance schedules at each of its 27 branches. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to make sure that nothing gets out of hand or falls down," board 
Chairman Thomas F. Riley said. 
</P>
<P>
 Libraries have absorbed the heaviest budget cuts of any county department in 
the past three years, forcing a 40% reduction in hours and the loss of 75 
full-time workers. During that same period, county officials also curtailed 
spending on maintenance and equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 The review comes at a time when a special, board-appointed library task force 
is preparing a study of its own on how the library can raise more money through 
individual contributions or other programs to maintain current operations. 
</P>
<P>
 The task force report is expected to be completed next month before the county 
begins budget hearings.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COSTA MESA; COUNCIL TO CONSIDER LARGE RETAIL CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHELBY GRAD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Plans to build a 400,000-square-foot retail and entertainment complex across 
the street from South Coast Plaza will come before the City Council for a vote 
Aug. 15. 
</P>
<P>
 Arnel Development Co.'s proposal calls for the construction of movie theaters, 
restaurants and several discount department stores as well as other smaller 
shops on vacant land between the San Diego Freeway and South Coast Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 The Planning Commission gave preliminary approval for the project last week. 
If approved, construction on the complex could begin later this year, city 
officials said. The center might open by Christmas, 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 The shopping center would be built next to two office towers in the Metro 
Pointe development near South Coast Drive and Bear Street. 
</P>
<P>
 A development agreement signed several years ago reserved the land for a 
1-million-square-foot office complex complete with six high-rise buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 But Arnel officials this year asked the city to modify the agreement to allow 
for a smaller shopping development, saying there was strong demand for another 
retail center in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said they supported Arnel's decision to reduce the intensity of 
the development. Alice Angus, Costa Mesa's senior planner, said that a recent 
update of the city's general plan called for less building in the area than was 
outlined in Arnel's original development agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 "The city is favorable to lower density levels," Angus said. 
</P>
<P>
 The shopping center would include 2,500 parking spaces as well as a bridge 
that would direct customers from one of the parking structures to the main 
shopping area. 
</P>
<P>
 A multiscreen Edwards cinema as well as some restaurants would anchor the west 
end of the complex, while several "big box" discount stores such as Marshall's 
and Nordstrom's Rack would be built on the east end. The developer also plans 
to locate a bookstore as well as clothing shops and an electronics store in the 
center. 
</P>
<P>
 No direct link is planned between Metro Pointe and South Coast Plaza. But 
shoppers can travel between the two malls simply by walking across Bear Street. 
</P>
<P>
 Driving to the site will become easier in the coming months when an off-ramp 
from the San Diego Freeway to South Coast Drive is completed. Construction of 
the ramp is now underway along the northbound side of the freeway between 
Fairview Road and Bristol Street.SHELBY GRAD

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; 7,700 
CARTONS OF UNTAXED CIGARETTES SEIZED; 2 MEN HELD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two Los Angeles men have been arrested on suspicion of possessing and 
transporting untaxed cigarettes and alcoholic beverages as investigators seized 
more than 7,700 cartons of cigarettes that had not been taxed by the state of 
California, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Arnulfo Vasquez, 46, and Felix Antonio Montes, 31, were taken into custody 
Sunday by officers of the California State Police and were being held in lieu 
of $300,000 bail each. 
</P>
<P>
 The untaxed cigarettes were found as search warrants were served at the Los 
Angeles homes of both men and at a business owned by Vasquez, State Board of 
Equalization officials said. Officers also seized $12,000 in cash and 131 
bottles of untaxed alcoholic beverages. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before Proposition 99 increased the tax on cigarettes, this was only a casual 
problem," said Matthew K. Fong, vice chairman of the Board of Equalization. 
"But as the tax was raised, so did an incentive for some people to cheat." 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 99 boosted cigarette taxes from 10 cents to 35 cents per pack. The 
equalization board estimates that the sale of untaxed cigarettes costs 
California between $20 million to $50 million a year in lost revenue.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: POMONA; KNIFE-WIELDING 
INTRUDER KILLED BY MAN, POLICE SAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A veteran U.S. Customs inspector shot and killed a knife-wielding neighbor who 
broke into his mobile home in Pomona early Tuesday morning, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 George Silva, a senior customs inspector at Terminal Island in Long Beach, 
fired one shot from his .38-caliber revolver at Alex W. Mastoras, 36, who had 
pried open a window in Silva's mobile home and entered shortly after 1:30 a.m., 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The wounded man fled through the window, collapsed outside with a bullet wound 
to the upper torso and died at Pomona Valley Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents of Big's, the trailer park in the 1400 block of West Mission 
Boulevard where the shooting occurred, said they had been plagued recently by a 
rash of break-ins. The modest, 113-unit park is home to a number of elderly 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Mastoras had lived for the past nine years at the park with his 74-year-old 
mother and ill stepfather, said Shirley Quist, the park's manager. She said 
Mastoras already had been warned to stop his door-to-door forays during which 
he would demand $5 loans from the elderly residents. Many residents thought 
Mastoras was burglarizing the park's residents but none had caught him in the 
act, Quist said.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: SANTA MONICA; PETITION 
DRIVE DEMANDS CRACKDOWN ON HOMELESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

By JOHN BUZBEE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Weary of panhandlers at ATMs, drug dealers in the parks and millions of 
dollars in social service spending, Santa Monica neighborhood activists dumped 
12,000 signatures in the city clerk's office Tuesday, demanding a vote on a 
long list of get-tough homeless policies. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've always been a city with a heart," said Jean Sedillos, a community 
activist and longtime opponent of the renters' rights group that dominates 
local politics. "This injects a brain into the picture." 
</P>
<P>
 The petition, which includes some measures similar to steps already taken by 
the City Council, is the latest sign that liberal Santa Monica's long-tolerant 
attitude toward the homeless has begun to harden. It calls for a public vote on 
measures that would prohibit panhandlers from coming within three feet of the 
people they solicit, panhandling within 50 feet of automatic teller machines 
and verbally abusing those they ask for money. 
</P>
<P>
 The referendum would also cap or reduce spending for homeless services, close 
public parks at night and require new procedures to track the effectiveness of 
city programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Fueling the petition drive is concern among some residents that when it comes 
to the homeless, Santa Monica has been too permissive and too quick to spend 
money. 
</P>
<P>
 In the face of such sentiment, the City Council, long reluctant to crack down 
on the homeless, has recently passed homeless measures of it own. 
</P>
<P>
 The council has decided to shift more of the city's homeless spending from 
emergency aid to long-term programs. Last week, it voted to require panhandlers 
to stay 80 feet away from ATMs -- a tougher restriction than the petitioners 
are seeking. It it expected to take effect next month. Council members have 
also approved a nighttime park closure law, which will not be fully in force 
until a homeless shelter opens this fall. 
</P>
<P>
 After the petition was delivered, Councilman Ken Genser said some of the new 
proposals, such as the requirement that panhandlers stay at least three feet 
from people they are soliciting, might be unconstitutional or difficult to 
enforce. He dismissed them as politicking in advance of the city's Nov. 8 
council elections. "At best, it's a feel-good thing. At worst, it's a political 
trick," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sedillos said petition circulators, including volunteers and paid signature 
gatherers, collected the signatures of 12,108 Santa Monica voters. The petition 
needs about 5,400 signatures to qualify for November's general election ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers of the drive missed a deadline for turning in signatures, but they 
could still get the measure on the November ballot if the council approves it. 
</P>
<P>
 After a slow start, Sedillos said, signature gatherers had no trouble. But Ron 
Taylor, a formerly homeless man running for City Council, said petition 
organizers were being too pushy. In fact, he said, they were panhandling for 
signatures. 
</P>
<P>
 "They didn't take 'No' for an answer," he said. "Panhandling, whether you're 
doing it for a signature or a quarter, is panhandling."

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: WESTSIDE; MAN SLAIN BY 
ARMORED TRUCK DRIVER DURING HOLDUP IN MALL

<P>
 A robber who pulled a gun on two armored-truck company drivers in a crowded 
elevator at the Beverly Center was shot to death by one of them Tuesday when he 
tried to force the men into their vehicle, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Police Sgt. Bruce Wallace said the incident occurred about 2:45 
p.m., when two drivers for the Loomis armored truck company arrived at the 
Westside shopping mall to make a pickup or delivery. 
</P>
<P>
 Wallace said the two men took the elevator from the second floor of the 
parking structure to the seventh floor of the mall, got off, conducted their 
business and got back into the elevator to return to their vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
 As the doors began to close, the gunman slipped in behind them, Wallace said, 
and "somewhere between the seventh floor and the second floor, with a bunch of 
other passengers on the elevator," the man produced a handgun and aimed it at 
the two guards. 
</P>
<P>
 Wallace said the man forced the Loomis employees to get off the elevator at 
the second floor. 
</P>
<P>
 "But when they got off, the suspect paid too much attention to one employee," 
Wallace said. The distraction enabled the second Loomis employee to pull out 
his service revolver, Wallace said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He fired once, shooting the suspect in the head and killing him," Wallace 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Coroner's spokesman Scott Carrier said the name of the dead man was not 
immediately available, pending notification of next of kin. SHAWN HUBLER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: YORBA LINDA; MURDER WARRANT ISSUED FOR EX-DEPUTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEN ELLINGWOOD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Authorities issued an arrest warrant Tuesday for a former Los Angeles County 
sheriff's deputy in connection with the fatal shooting of an Alpha Beta manager 
during a robbery last month. 
</P>
<P>
 Police are seeking Stephen Moreland Redd, 49, in connection with the Yorba 
Linda slaying and two crimes in Orange this year at the same shopping center. A 
security guard was shot in one of those. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mr. Redd is considered armed and dangerous," said Brea Detective Jerry 
Brakebill, whose department patrols Yorba Linda. "He is a killer and has 
attempted to kill three people, as well as the robberies." 
</P>
<P>
 Redd was released from state prison last year after serving 11 years of an 
18-year sentence for wounding a police officer during a La Habra bank robbery 
in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
 Redd, whose last known address was in Fullerton, is believed to be in Southern 
California, where he has relatives and friends, Brakebill said. Redd is 6 feet 
tall and has a shaved head, but he often changes his appearance by growing a 
beard, wearing wigs and rapidly altering his weight. Redd is a surfer and 
roller skater and was seen two weekends ago near Santa Monica Pier, Brakebill 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Alpha Beta night manager, Timothy Eugene McVeigh, 34, of Santa Ana, was 
shot to death when he approached the check stand where a gunman wearing a wig 
was holding up a clerk for $156, Brakebill said. 
</P>
<P>
 Redd also is suspected of wounding a uniformed security guard near a Vons 
market on Lincoln Avenue in May. That attacker wore a long, brown wig. He also 
is suspected of a holdup at a Sav-On store in March at the same shopping 
center. 
</P>
<P>
 Brakebill said police linked Redd to all three crimes through evidence left at 
the scenes. He declined to say what that evidence was. 
</P>
<P>
 Redd served as a Los Angeles County sheriff's deputy from 1967 to 1973, when 
he resigned for personal reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 After robbing Security Pacific Bank in 1982, he led police on a chase over 
three counties, firing an automatic rifle with one hand and driving at speeds 
topping 100 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
 The wounded officer, John Reese, retired two years ago after years of surgery 
and rehabilitation, said La Habra Police Sgt. Phil Stufflebean. 
</P>
<P>
 Brea police asked anyone with information to contact authorities at (714) 
671-4473 or (714) 990-7911. Alpha Beta's parent company has offered a $10,000 
reward for information leading to a conviction in the murder case. KEN

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: MISSION VIEJO; CITY MIGHT REGULATE ADULT NEWS RACKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MESSINA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Distributors of adult-oriented news rack publications would be required to 
apply for a permit from City Hall under an ordinance backed by the Planning 
Commission this week. 
</P>
<P>
 City planners said the ordinance, which must receive final approval from the 
City Council, will help keep track of news racks that feature sexually explicit 
materials. 
</P>
<P>
 The news rack ordinance also would enable the city to regulate where the 
stands are located. In addition, the proposed law requires that no sexually 
suggestive words or pictures be visible from outside the vending machine. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we're trying to do is get news racks registered and make sure to put 
them where they belong," Commissioner Sherri Butterfield said. "This way, if we 
have a problem with the material or if a newsstand gets knocked over or needs 
repair, we can contact the owner directly." 
</P>
<P>
 The ordinance would not require a permit fee. Also, only one permit is 
required for any number of news racks. 
</P>
<P>
 Butterfield said there is no count of the number of news racks featuring adult 
materials in Mission Viejo, and "one of the purposes for instituting a permit 
process is to take an inventory." 
</P>
<P>
 Planners had agreed on the need for a news rack ordinance in June, but delayed 
their approval in order to insert the permit requirement and further define 
descriptions of adult materials. 
</P>
<P>
 The news rack law would allow removal of any stands that allow the display of 
sexually explicit words or pictures. News racks that are placed near schools or 
impede the public right of way could also be relocated under the proposed 
ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
 News rack distributors also would have to install blinders that cover at least 
two-thirds of the publication. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed ordinance is the city's latest attempt to regulate adult-oriented 
businesses or materials in Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the City Council passed an adult business ordinance that restricted 
establishments such as cabaret shows and massage parlors to certain areas of 
Mission Viejo to keep them away from churches, schools and residential areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Nobody appeared before the commission, which met Monday, to oppose the 
ordinance. FRANK MESSINA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: TUSTIN; GANG-STYLE CLOTHING BANNED IN SCHOOLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BERT ELJERA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gang-style clothing will be banned in the Tustin Unified School District 
starting in September under a new dress policy unanimously approved this week 
by the Board of Education. 
</P>
<P>
 But school principals will have the authority to determine what constitutes 
gang-related apparel after consulting with the police and the Sheriff's 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Although gangs are currently not a problem in Tustin schools, the new dress 
code will help keep campuses safer, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to gang-style apparel, clothing that is unusually tight, revealing 
or exposes the midsection or undergarments also will be prohibited. In this 
category are bikini tops and bra tops, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wearing gang-related clothing is a threat to the health and safety of 
students, teachers and school employees, trustees said in adopting the dress 
policy Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Also prohibited are clothing, including hats, jewelry and accessories, which 
are associated with violence, drugs, alcohol, obscenity and racial hatred. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana, Los Alamitos, Garden Grove, Huntington Beach and several other 
school districts in the county have adopted similar dress code policies to help 
prevent the spread of gangs. 
</P>
<P>
 Supt. David Andrews said that the list of clothing considered gang apparel 
will be constantly updated during the school year because of changing styles. 
</P>
<P>
 Under current rules, a student considered improperly dressed will be sent home 
to change. It will be left to the principals to impose disciplinary actions 
against students violating the new dress code, officials said.BERT ELJERA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: BUENA PARK; BUDGET IN THE BLACK THANKS TO WINDFALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLEY WRIGHT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council approved a $35-million budget this week that was saved from a 
deficit by a windfall credit from the public retirement system. 
</P>
<P>
 The $2-million credit from the state Public Employees' Retirement System more 
than offset the projected deficit of more than $250,000, finance director Greg 
Beaubien said.The state had informed officials in May that the city had a 
surplus in its PERS account. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents may face a raise in water rates later this year, however, to cover a 
$500,000 deficit in the water fund, Beaubien said. 
</P>
<P>
 The city buys water from the Metropolitan and Orange County water districts. 
Beaubien said the Metropolitan district is in the midst of an infrastructure 
project and that the city is helpless to keep costs down. 
</P>
<P>
 "Being the victim of outside agencies, we are being blackmailed to raise rates 
to cover those costs," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members balked at a request from the Fire Department for $125,000 in 
anticipated overtime. After Oct. 1, the city will no longer have its own Fire 
Department but will contract with the county. 
</P>
<P>
 Fire Chief Herb R. Jewell said the department needed the money because two 
firefighters were on long-term sick leave and others had been sent to special 
paramedic training sessions. Additionally, the council had decided not to fill 
two vacancies and those positions had to be covered, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The council approved the overtime, but at the suggestion of Councilman Don R. 
Griffin, who called $125,000 "excessive" and asked that the city manager 
closely monitor overtime spending in the Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
 The council agreed, with Councilman Arthur C. Brown and Mayor Donald L. Bone 
dissenting.LESLEY WRIGHT

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FOUNTAIN VALLEY; SANITATION DISTRICTS WORKERS PICKET PLANT 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 About 30 employees of the Orange County Sanitation Districts picketed in front 
of the agency's Ellis Avenue plant Tuesday to express their dissatisfaction 
with the lack of progress in contract negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 Operations and maintenance workers carried placards and took personal leave 
time to demonstrate for about two hours. Workers' three-year contracts expired 
last November. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people are really unhappy about the way the district has been 
treating us and we're trying to bring it to the public's attention and the 
district's attention," said Ellen Ray, chief steward of Operating Engineers 
Local 501. 
</P>
<P>
 Union members are expected to vote late next week on whether to accept the 
Sanitation Districts' final contract offer or reject it and authorize a strike, 
Ray said. 
</P>
<P>
 The union represents 281 employees in the operations and maintenance 
department, and of those workers, 171 are union members, Ray said. The 
employees keep the sewage treatment facilities in Fountain Valley and 
Huntington Beach operating, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ray, an equipment operator and 9 1/2-year employee, said management is 
offering no pay raise for the first year of a three-year contract.  
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people aren't happy with that," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Corinne Berenson, Sanitation Districts spokeswoman, declined to comment on the 
contract dispute. 
</P>
<P>
 Berenson said service will not be interrupted if workers strike. 
</P>
<P>
 A 3% pay raise is being offered for the second and third years of the 
contract, Ray said, adding that the district wants employees to work 12-hour 
shifts instead of their current nine-hour shifts. 
</P>
<P>
 Union members are also in disagreement with contract language that deals with 
layoffs and with the plant contracting for outside services. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bottom line is we want to be treated fairly and we're not," Ray said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ray added that workers are planning to picket the Aug. 10 board of directors 
meeting.DEBRA CANO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; SWAP MEET PROPOSAL REJECTED BY COUNCIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBRA CANO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council this week scrapped a proposal for an indoor swap meet in a 
vacant industrial building after hearing opposition from nearby businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fact is the majority of the neighborhood is against it," said Mayor Linda 
Moulton Patterson, who opposed the project. 
</P>
<P>
 The council voted 4 to 2 Monday against the proposal to establish a swap meet 
with 325 vendor spaces in a 212,500-square-foot industrial building at 5555 
McFadden Ave. 
</P>
<P>
 Some nearby business owners favored the swap meet. But opponents, who believe 
that the property should remain an industrial use, included other area tenants 
and property owners as well as officials from Huntington Beach Mall. 
</P>
<P>
 Patricia Rogers-Laude, marketing director for the mall, said that swap meet 
vendors would have a devastating effect on local business and would siphon off 
existing sales in the city. Rogers-Laude also charged that established 
retailers "would be dealt an economic blow by unfair competition." 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Ralph Bauer had filed an appeal of the Planning Commission's denial 
of the project. Bauer and Councilman Earle Robitaille cast votes in favor of 
the swap meet. Councilman Jim Silva abstained because of a possible conflict of 
interest because he rents an office next to the proposed project site. 
</P>
<P>
 Bauer said he favored the swap meet idea because it would recycle a vacant 
industrial building into a tax-generating business that would stimulate retail 
business in the city. The swap meet would have generated about $200,000 a year 
in revenue to the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Frazer Tremblay, who operates swap meets in three other cities in the United 
States and Canada, said he plans to file a lawsuit against the city for his 
losses in attempting to gain city approval for the project. 
</P>
<P>
 Tremblay said he has invested about $50,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Connors, group vice president of Masco Corp., which owns the building, 
said the company has been trying to find a tenant for the last four years. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've tried everything to lease it or sell it, but there have been no 
legitimate offers," Connors said. "I'm disappointed at the shortsighted 
approach of several of the council members." 
</P>
<P>
 Connors said the company has endured a several-million-dollar loss in not 
being able to lease the building.  
</P>
<P>
 Connors predicted that without the swap meet as a tenant, "the building will 
sit vacant for the next five to 10 years." DEBRA CANO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; SURF CONTEST'S BEST SEATS COME AT A 
PRICE

<P>
 If spectators want the best seats at the beach to watch the U.S. Open of 
Surfing finals this weekend at the pier, they will have to pay for it. 
</P>
<P>
 But while grandstand seats cost $7 a day, there is plenty of free seating on 
the sand, event organizers said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a ton of free seating out here," said Don Meek, executive director 
of the U.S. Open of Surfing. 
</P>
<P>
 The surfing competition, the fourth stop on the world championship tour and 
the only one in the continental United States, started Tuesday and continues 
through Sunday on the south side of the pier. 
</P>
<P>
 Meek said there will be a charge for grandstand seating on Friday, Saturday 
and Sunday. Tickets are $7 a day, or $15 for a three-day pass. Meek said 
children 12 and younger who are with their parents may attend for free. 
</P>
<P>
 Grandstand seating on the sand and pier will be available at no charge to 
spectators today and Thursday, Meek said. 
</P>
<P>
 An outdoor festival of exhibitors of surf products and food booths also is 
open daily from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.  
</P>
<P>
 Meek said the charge for weekend grandstand seating will help offset costs of 
putting on the back-to-back surfing contests. Last week, the Op Pro Surfing 
Championship was held at the beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "Had we not (charged for seating), we wouldn't have come to Huntington Beach 
to do this event," Meek said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tickets for grandstand seating will be sold at the pier and will also be 
available at Jack's Surfboards and Huntington Surf & Sport. Reserved seating 
can also be ordered by calling TicketMaster or Prime Ticket at (310) 286-3700.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA ANA; NOT-GUILTY PLEA IN WOUNDING OF CHILD

 A suspected gang member pleaded not guilty Tuesday to assault and weapons 
charges stemming from a July 10 shooting that injured a 5-year-old Santa Ana 
boy caught in a cross-fire. 
</P>
<P>
 Rogelio Arenas, 18, of Santa Ana allegedly opened fire on a passing car with a 
shotgun. Johnathon Garcia was wounded in the back as he was playing on his 
grandfather's lawn. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutor Mark Sevigny said it was fortunate that Garcia was not seriously 
injured. The youngster was hospitalized for one day and released. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any number of people could have been killed by this," said Sevigny, who is 
assigned to the district attorney's gang prosecution unit. "It was extremely 
dangerous conduct." 
</P>
<P>
 Arenas and Richard William Hernandez, 21, also of Santa Ana, were arrested 
shortly after the shooting on suspicion of attempted murder. 
</P>
<P>
 Sevigny said he sought an indictment on assault and weapons charges against 
Arenas because there was insufficient evidence to prove Arenas intended to kill 
anyone. He said the case remains under investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County Grand Jury indicted Arenas last Thursday on felony charges 
of discharging a firearm at an occupied vehicle and assault with a firearm. 
Arenas pleaded not guilty Tuesday in Orange County Superior Court and is being 
held in lieu of $50,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Public Defender Dennis Sakai said he was relieved to learn that his 
client was not indicted on attempted murder charges. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to say too much about the case right now, but I believe the 
charges are now more in line with what the actual evidence can show," Sakai 
said, but added that he intends to continue fighting the charges. 
</P>
<P>
 A trial date is expected to be set for later this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Sevigny said that evidence collected so far indicates Hernandez was at the 
scene of the shooting, and that Hernandez is expected to be charged with the 
lesser crime of being an accessory after the fact. Hernandez is awaiting a 
preliminary hearing in Municipal Court. RENE LYNCH

CLINTON ASKS CONGRESS FOR 'GHOST TOWN' AID; QUAKE: PRESIDENT REQUESTS $225 
MILLION MAINLY FOR THE VACANT, CRIME-INFESTED ENCLAVES OF DAMAGED HOUSING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Responding to a shortage of money for restoring quake-damaged housing, 
President Clinton asked Congress on Tuesday to free up $225 million for the 
cities of Los Angeles and Santa Monica to issue as repair loans, particularly 
to those vacant, crime-infested enclaves known as "ghost towns." 
</P>
<P>
 The funding, leftover aid from highway and school repair programs, would 
provide zero-interest loans to hundreds of owners of wrecked apartment 
buildings and condominiums unable to get loans through banks or other federal 
aid programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles housing officials praised the announcement, saying it will nearly 
close a shortfall in the money needed to repair the more than 50,000 
apartments, condos and single-family houses severely damaged Jan. 17.  
</P>
<P>
 Speaking to Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan and Santa Monica Mayor Judy Abdo 
by telephone from Washington, Clinton called the money a "down payment on our 
partnership with the cities to solve this 'ghost town' problem." 
</P>
<P>
 "This goes beyond a typical federal disaster response and it's possible 
because we have been able to reallocate some other disaster funds," he told the 
mayors, Housing and Urban Development Secretary Henry Cisneros and Sen. Dianne 
Feinstein, (D-Calif.), who were also on the line from Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 If the funding is approved by Congress, as expected, Los Angeles housing 
officials will get $200 million of the total, while Santa Monica -- which lost 
5% of its housing stock in the magnitude 6.8 quake -- will receive the 
$25-million balance. Both cities will reserve the money mostly for multifamily 
buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 The funds are the latest of $11.9 billion in federal relief set aside by the 
Clinton Administration and Congress for quake victims in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 The President took advantage of the telephone conference call -- and the media 
attention it had attracted -- to mention a glowing report on the federal 
response to the disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 "At every opportunity, federal agencies responded with speed, flexibility and 
creativity to meet the needs of earthquake victims," according to the report, 
drafted by the federal Office of Management and Budget. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan said he requested the housing loans from Clinton last week after 
learning that an estimated $400-million surplus in federal funds set aside for 
repairing quake damage to freeways and schools was available for other uses. 
</P>
<P>
 The mayor said the money is to be funneled to multiunit housing repair loans 
because that is where city housing officials have identified a large gap 
between need and funds. 
</P>
<P>
 "This will give us the flexibility to use the money where it is needed," 
Riordan told Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 Money previously allocated by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the 
Small Business Administration and private insurance companies is expected to 
fund repairs of about 30,000 of the 50,000 severely damaged dwelling units in 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 City housing officials had already secured $110 million in funding from other 
federal and local sources, enough to repair another 5,000 units. But that left 
the owners of the remaining 15,000 or so units without any help, or hope. 
</P>
<P>
 The money Clinton requested Tuesday is expected to repair most of those 
remaining units, said Gary Squier, general manager of the Los Angeles city 
housing department. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the most part, these resources will take care of the bulk of the 
(remaining) damage," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Particularly troubling for those housing officials trying to restore the 
city's damaged dwellings was the evolution of the so-called ghost towns, 
clusters of vacant, damaged buildings that became infested with vagrants, 
scavengers, drug dealers, gang members and even prostitutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors and city officials feared that the crime in those buildings would 
spread to nearby neighborhoods, and in some cases it quickly did. Two fires in 
vacant "ghost town" buildings already have been blamed on trespassers. 
</P>
<P>
 The city has launched an aggressive attack plan against ghost towns that 
includes police sweeps followed by crews boarding up and fencing off vacant 
buildings. In the latest step in that process, the city has hired 
round-the-clock security guards to keep trespassers out of the 12 ghost towns 
identified in the San Fernando Valley, Hollywood and Mid-City area. 
</P>
<P>
 The bulk of the money requested Tuesday will be available to owners within the 
ghost towns, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 After the phone conference with Clinton, Councilman Richard Alarcon, whose 
northeast Valley district includes two ghost towns, said the money "could not 
have come at a better time." 
</P>
<P>
 "This money, if approved by Congress, will make it possible for the city to 
deal with one of our biggest problems -- the ghost-town buildings -- which 
still represent a hazard to the community." 
</P>
<P>
 Another important aspect of the funding request is that the owners of severely 
damaged condominium units, which received an estimated $107-million damage in 
the quake, will have greater access to federal funds.

SIMPSON CASE FORCES JAIL RENOVATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A court order requiring the Sheriff's Department to provide O.J. Simpson's 
squad of attorneys a place to confer with their famous client on weekends is 
prompting renovations to visiting areas of the Men's Central Jail. 
</P>
<P>
 The attorneys' room where Simpson meets with Robert L. Shapiro and other 
members of his legal team normally is closed Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays.But 
the room was made available to Simpson and his attorneys last weekend and 
staffed with a guard earning overtime pay because other visiting rooms were too 
small to accommodate them. 
</P>
<P>
 Those visiting rooms, which are equipped with glass walls to separate inmates 
from their visitors, are being enlarged and more intercoms installed, sheriff's 
spokesman Brian Jones said Tuesday. When completed, an inmate will be able to 
speak with as many as four people at a time. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to enlarging the visiting rooms, the department will install a 
partition on the attorneys' side of the glass wall to provide a measure of 
privacy. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones said the department had planned the renovations in response to logistic 
problems in the past involving other teams of attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
 The project was speeded up, however, to save the cost of paying overtime to 
monitor Simpson's visitation sessions. In another cost-saving move, the 
department is planning to install additional cameras that will allow the wing 
where he is jailed to be monitored remotely, according to a sheriff's official. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson is housed in a 9-by-7-foot windowless cell in the so-called 
"high-power" wing of the 6,500-inmate jail, where other residents have included 
Christian Brando, Charles Keating and, currently, Erik Menendez.

CONTRACT TALKS BEGIN WITH DISTRICT, TEACHERS AT ODDS OVER RESTORING PAY; LABOR: 
SCHOOL OFFICIALS SAY THEY MAY BE ABLE TO AFFORD ONLY A PARTIAL SALARY INCREASE. 
UNION LEADERS HAVE THREATENED A STRIKE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Leaders of the Los Angeles Unified School District and the teachers union 
began face-to-face contract talks Tuesday but the two sides appeared to be far 
apart on the key issue: restoring a 10% cut in teachers' salaries. 
</P>
<P>
 Meeting in offices at the United Way near Downtown, officials on both sides 
said they planned to spend at least two days hashing out the pay issue. 
Teachers union leaders, who have threatened to strike when school starts in the 
fall, said they are seeking restoration of the 10% cut from teachers' pay over 
the last three years -- which would cost the district $139 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going in to ask for the full restoration of our salaries," United 
Teachers-Los Angeles President Helen Bernstein said as she entered the meeting 
rooms. "I'm saying that our teachers deserve to be adequately compensated for 
the work that they do with L.A. Unified." 
</P>
<P>
 District officials say that giving back part of the lost wages may be 
possible, but Supt. Sid Thompson said the school system could not afford a 
double-digit boost. "I don't see that in the package," Thompson said before 
talks began Tuesday morning. "Somehow (that's) a little bit of stretch when the 
state gave us nothing." 
</P>
<P>
 Board of Education President Mark Slavkin, who is representing the school 
board in the talks, was less pessimistic. "Absolutely, we're trying to restore 
salaries," Slavkin said. "It's a question of how much we think is there and how 
much they'll accept." 
</P>
<P>
 The talks got off to a noisy start -- school district officials began 
rearranging the tables and chairs to face the union team. "I guess we're 
getting closer," Slavkin quipped as he helped move a table. 
</P>
<P>
 The district had seven representatives, including Thompson and Slavkin, at the 
table. The union had an eight-member team, including Bernstein and two 
accountants. For the first time, the district did not have lawyers at the 
bargaining table, a move that union leaders applauded as a step toward 
promoting a more positive tone during negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday's meeting, which is scheduled to continue today, marks the first round 
of contract negotiations since last year's labor dispute, when state Assembly 
Speaker Willie Brown stepped in as mediator. A strike was narrowly averted when 
teachers agreed to take a 10% pay cut for two years. 
</P>
<P>
 Although school board members say money is available in the district's 
$4.2-million budget for at least a partial salary restoration, union leaders 
say they have proof that enough money exists for a substantial reimbursement. 
Union leaders arrived at the session armed with an audit that they said shows 
money is available from a variety of sources. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernstein, who represents 32,000 teachers, nurses, counselors and school 
psychologists, refused to release details of the audit. "We are very prepared, 
as you can see," she said, displaying a thick binder marked "Confidential," "to 
go into bargaining in good faith to make sure we can restore the salaries." 
</P>
<P>
 The union spent about $70,000 for the audit, which was intended to identify 
possible accounts and reserves that could be used for teachers' pay. The audit, 
conducted by an outside accounting firm, took more than four months to 
complete. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year the district cut most employees' salaries by 10%. Restoring those 
wages would cost $200 million.  
</P>
<P>
 District officials already have identified a possible $116 million for a 
partial pay restoration. But they said they are still waiting to hear from the 
state on the availability of some of those funds and that they could be barred 
from using that money for ongoing salary expenditures.  
</P>
<P>
 Of that $116 million, nearly $42 million comes from the employees' health 
benefit account, about $54 million would come from the state reimbursement of 
integration claims and $7 million from higher lottery revenues. About $8 
million would be rolled over from last year's budget and another $5 million 
could come from reimbursed earthquake repair costs. 
</P>
<P>
 But school board members, who plan to meet Thursday in a closed session to 
review contract talks, said they are concerned about using the one-time 
reimbursements for ongoing salary costs. They said they want to be sure the 
money will be available over several years so that cuts do not have to be made 
in the district's tightly balanced budget. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the board members said they want the negotiations on a fast track 
to avoid a protracted labor dispute. "People in Los Angeles are really tired of 
hearing about the dispute between the district and the teachers," said board 
member Leticia Quezada. "The public really does not want that to continue."

D.A. RECEIVES STATE GRANT FOR WORKERS' COMP PROBES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LILY DIZON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi announced Tuesday that his office has 
awarded $1.17 million to the Orange County district attorney's office to 
continue to investigate and prosecute workers' compensation fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 The grant is part of $11.9 million in grants to 28 district attorneys' offices 
in the state, according to Garamendi's office.Los Angeles County received the 
largest amount, $5 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County will use the grants to pay the salaries and benefits of 
employees in the workers' compensation group of the district attorney's major 
frauds unit, said Supervising Deputy Dist. Atty. Pete Huelsenbeck. That unit 
prosecutes embezzlement and security cases as well as automobile insurance and 
workers' compensation frauds. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're delighted to be able to be so active in the prosecution of these 
crimes," Huelsenbeck said. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the third year the insurance commissioner's office has awarded funds 
to finance the workers' compensation anti-fraud group, which has to reapply for 
the grants annually, Huelsenbeck said. The first year, his group received about 
$200,000 to launch its office. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't have the exact numbers of cases right now, but these crimes have 
risen steadily in the past three years as you can tell," by the grant increase, 
Huelsenbeck said.

COUNTY KICKS IN ONE-FIFTH OF IMMIGRATION INITIATIVE FUNDS; MONEY: CAMPAIGN 
FINANCE REPORTS ALSO SHOW THAT TWO COMMITTEES FAVORING A COMMERCIAL AIRPORT AT 
EL TORO HAVE RAISED FOUR TIMES MORE THAN THE OPPOSITION.

 Orange County voters and state legislators are among the top financial donors 
in California for the "Save Our State" immigration initiative to be voted on 
statewide in November, according to campaign finance statements filed Tuesday 
with the registrar of voters' office. 
</P>
<P>
 In the local initiative calling for a proposed commercial airport at the El 
Toro Marine Corps Air Station -- an election battle that is expected to match 
the wealthy business community against the passionate opponents of the proposed 
South County airport -- two political committees organized in favor of the 
ballot measure have out-raised opponents by a 4-to-1 ratio. 
</P>
<P>
 Other campaign reports show Huntington Beach Mayor Linda Moulton Patterson and 
Councilman Jim Silva nearly starting from scratch in the fund-raising wars as 
they vie for a seat on the Orange County Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 Having emptied their wallets to win places in the November runoff election, 
campaign reports filed Tuesday show an early advantage for Moulton Patterson, 
who has almost $25,000 cash on hand from a primary campaign that spent 
$148,433. Silva has just over $4,000 after spending about $141,000 during the 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 The emotionally charged statewide campaign for the immigration reform 
initiative has raised a total of $335,923, with one-fifth of the contributions 
or loans coming from Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those near the top of the donor list for the immigration measure is 
Tustin accountant Ron Prince, who loaned the campaign $20,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Prince, who conceived of Proposition 187, known as "Save Our State," said 
Tuesday he decided to back the loan for the campaign "because I believe in it, 
and it's something that needs to be done, and we have to support it." 
</P>
<P>
 The proposition, which has drawn opposition from Roman Catholic Cardinal Roger 
M. Mahony and Latino rights organizations, would deny numerous public benefits 
including education and non-emergency health care to illegal immigrants. It 
also would require public employees and health care workers to identify illegal 
immigrants and parents of U.S.-born children. 
</P>
<P>
 Other top financial backers for the immigration measure from Orange County 
include: Barbara Coe, an executive secretary for the Anaheim Police Department 
and chairwoman of the California Coalition for Immigration Reform, who donated 
$15,000; Container Supply Co., which is owned by state Sen. Rob Hurtt (R-Garden 
Grove), and which gave $15,000; and state Assemblyman Mickey Conroy (R-Garden 
Grove), who gave $5,000. State Assemblyman Gil Ferguson (R-Newport Beach) 
donated $3,000 for a campaign mailer and postage. 
</P>
<P>
 Major financial backers for the "Save Our State" initiative from outside 
Orange County include the California Republican Party, with non-monetary 
contributions for mailers and postage totaling $86,678; and state Assemblyman 
Richard L. Mountjoy (R-Monrovia), who gave $25,250. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 The local campaign in support of a commercial airport at El Toro has far 
out-raised money compared to airport opponents, according to the campaign 
statements. 
</P>
<P>
 The Committee for 21,000 New Jobs, which sponsored the El Toro airport 
initiative, reported $176,636 in contributions since the start of the campaign, 
and $188,757 in expenditures, including $62,277 in outstanding debts. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the money was spent on an accelerated effort to qualify the initiative 
for the November ballot. The committee's report showed that sponsors of the 
initiative hired 36 people for the signature-gathering campaign, with only 
seven of them residents of Orange County. The group hired signature gatherers 
from as far away as Stockton, San Diego and Brawley, according to the 
disclosure statement. 
</P>
<P>
 The report also showed that developer George L. Argyros and real estate agent 
and Newport Beach Mayor Clarence J. Turner, two key backers of the measure, 
loaned the committee $43,000, with Argyros accounting for $35,000 of the total 
loan amount. Arnel Development Co., which is owned by Argyros, also has 
contributed $25,000 to the airport initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the major contributors to the measure were business owners, including 
Harry S. Rinker of Newport Beach, owner of Rinker Investments, who contributed 
$7,500 and John Curci also of Newport Beach, part-owner of Curci-Turner Co., 
who gave $6,000. Fluor Daniel, an Irvine-based construction company, donated 
$5,000. 
</P>
<P>
 There also were some sizable individual contributions: Donna S. Crean, 
identified as a Newport Beach homemaker, contributed $5,000, and Richard Bertea 
of Corona del Mar, whose occupation was not listed, gave $5,000. 
</P>
<P>
 A second pro-airport committee, the El Toro Initiative Committee, reported 
raising $6,000, all of it in a loan from Argyros and Arnel Development. 
Although the committee was listed as separate from the Committee for 21,000 New 
Jobs, both groups have the same treasurer, Dana W. Reed, and share the same 
Costa Mesa address. 
</P>
<P>
 On the opposite side of the El Toro initiative, Taxpayers for Responsible 
Planning reported raising $44,175.81 so far to defeat the November ballot 
measure. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the money came from more than 900 contributors who gave less than 
$100. Of the 54 donors who gave more than $100, 47 live in Laguna Hills and all 
but one of them are retired. 
</P>
<P>
 The major contributors to Taxpayers for Responsible Planning included Gary J. 
Kaingsbury of Irvine, listed as a teacher at the University of Phoenix, who 
gave $1,000; and the Santa Margarita Co., a San Juan Capistrano-based land 
developer, which contributed $5,000. The group also reported a $2,000 loan from 
Charles and Patricia McLaughlin, of Laguna Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 In the hotly contested primary race to succeed retiring District 2 Supervisor 
Harriett M. Wieder, Silva and Moulton Patterson bested the third-place 
finisher, Huntington Beach businesswoman Haydee V. Tillotson, who had 
considerably more financial resources. 
</P>
<P>
 The registrar of voters had not received as of Tuesday the last campaign 
finance statement for Tillotson, but the last report filed before the June 7 
primary showed she had put up most of the money for her campaign with loans 
totaling $342,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The November runoff not only pits two Huntington Beach city officials against 
each other, but also provides a political test of strength for Silva and local 
Republicans who are aiming to keep Moulton Patterson, a Democrat, from winning 
a seat on the Republican-dominated board. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're starting all over now," Silva said Tuesday. "I think things will really 
start to get moving this month." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Silva was the top vote-getter in the District 2 primary race, the 
councilman clearly struggled in the fund-raising category. In the final week of 
the spring campaign, he loaned the campaign $30,000, and he carries that debt 
into the runoff. 
</P>
<P>
 Moulton Patterson lists debts of $10,000, a loan she received just five days 
before the primary election from a local consulting firm. El Toro Donation 
Derby 
</P>
<P>
 Donations to committees on both sides of the El Toro initiative are heavily 
weighted on the side of those who favor turning the air base into an airport 
after the Marines leave. The two committees favoring conversion have gathered 
more than four times the amount taken in by the single committee opposed to a 
new airport. Donations received between Jan. 1 and June 30, 1994:

 Warning about hate, Hitler and "soldiers of Satan," a coalition of local 
Latino groups on Tuesday launched a campaign to battle the wide-ranging "Save 
Our State" initiative that seeks to oust illegal immigrants from California 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
 The newly formed group, dubbed the Children's Alliance, reserved its most 
fiery rhetoric for their neighbors, the Orange County group that organized the 
petition movement to bar undocumented immigrants from public schools and health 
clinics. 
</P>
<P>
 "We should be fighting this in Orange County, because here in Orange County is 
where SOS was given birth," said Nativo Lopez, whose Santa Ana organization, 
Hermandad Mexicana, hosted the coalition of about a dozen local groups.  
</P>
<P>
 "This is the heart of the cancer," said Arturo Montez, who mockingly labeled 
SOS, "Soldiers of Satan," and predicted that the proposition would create a 
Hitler-style police state. The measure, Proposition 187 on the November ballot, 
would cut off most public services for undocumented immigrants. All health 
services, except emergency care, would be prohibited. School officials would be 
expected to report children and parents they suspect of being here illegally. 
Law enforcement agencies would have to cooperate with the INS in the search for 
illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 The alliance, which includes the League of United Latin-American Citizens and 
the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, is the second 
coalition in Orange County this year to wage an educational campaign to counter 
anti-immigrant sentiment. 
</P>
<P>
 In May, a group called Orange County Alliance for Immigrant Rights formed to 
challenge negative stereotypes of immigrants. In addition, the Catholic Diocese 
of Orange County has been quietly laying the groundwork to battle the 
proposition. And the Children's Alliance plans to work with the parishes. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the pastors from the 53 Catholic churches in Orange County met last 
month to discuss a strategy that includes a voter registration drive, 
door-to-door campaigning and occasional Sunday sermons devoted to the issue. A 
second meeting was intended to educate church members about the issue, said 
Msgr. Jaime Soto of the diocese. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a presentation that dealt with the church's moral imperative to speak 
out," said Soto, who has preached against the initiative from the pulpit of his 
Santa Ana church. "The church has a moral imperative to protect the dignity of 
life, whether that be the life of the child in the womb or the life of an 
undocumented immigrant. We are called upon to cherish the dignity of that life 
and to seek out the means to include them." 
</P>
<P>
 The alliance charges that the measure would be costly to enforce and could 
even create health hazards if immigrant children are not allowed to be treated 
for sickness or immunized against disease. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbara Coe, a Huntington Beach resident and the chairwoman of California 
Coalition for Immigration Reform, which helped gather signatures for the 
initiative, disagrees. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the child is an illegal alien, then the child and his family have 135 days 
to return to their country of origin," Coe said. "Obviously, the child will be 
in the school system and is not going to be denied immunization during that 
period of time."  
</P>
<P>
 State Rep. Mickey Conroy (R-Orange), who supports the initiative, said of 
organizations such as the Alliance: "They ought to register those groups as 
foreign agents because they're representing nationals against our government." 
</P>
<P>
 The measure has become an issue in his 71st Assembly race for reelection 
against Democrat Jeanne Costales, who joined with Alliance members on Tuesday 
to denounce the initiative and its impact on health. 
</P>
<P>
 "Do you really want people cooking your food, cleaning your babies and taking 
care of your old folks when they have no access to health care?" she asked.

2 ARE HELD, 1 OTHER IS SOUGHT IN FATAL SHOOTING IN BUENA PARK

<P>
 Police have arrested two people in connection with the fatal shooting Monday 
of a Buena Park man outside his home near Knott's Berry Farm. 
</P>
<P>
 Sylvia Denise Gutierrez, 31, of Norwalk, was being held on suspicion of murder 
along with her brother, Vincent Albert Gutierrez, 32, of La Mirada, police 
said.Authorities on Tuesday were searching for a third person also believed to 
have been arguing with the victim, 30-year-old Arturo Macias. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were all arguing with (Macias) before the shooting," Lt. Mike Schwartz 
said. He did not disclose details of the argument, which neighbors reported 
overhearing before the 2:40 a.m. shooting next to a Knott's Berry Farm parking 
lot on Crescent Avenue. Schwartz said it was "some sort of personal dispute."  
</P>
<P>
 Schwartz said the third suspect may have been in a white van that witnesses 
saw leaving the scene. 
</P>
<P>
 Schwartz said Sylvia Gutierrez was a friend of Macias' live-in girlfriend, who 
he said witnessed the confrontation but was not involved. The girlfriend, whose 
name was not released, was heard screaming in the street after the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors said they heard an argument that began at the Macias home and then 
continued outside. One neighbor said he heard a barrage of about six shots, 
then a pause followed by two or three more shots. Macias was struck in the head 
and chest and later pronounced dead at West Anaheim Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Sylvia Gutierrez was being held at Central Women's Jail in Santa Ana. Vincent 
Gutierrez was being held at the Buena Park Police Department's jail facility. 
Bond was set at $250,000 each.

POLICE ARREST 2 SUSPECTS SHORTLY AFTER HOME ROBBERY; CRIME: RESIDENT OF A GATED

 Two San Clemente men suspected of tying up two women and a child in a Turtle 
Rock Summit home Tuesday were arrested less than half an hour later. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine police said Brian D. Finnan, 24, and Jeremy B. Keenan, 23, were being 
held at Orange County Jail on suspicion of armed robbery. 
</P>
<P>
 A 30-year-old woman whose name has not been released told police that a man 
forced his way into her house on Pemberly just before 11 a.m. He forced her, 
her 2-year-old son and her housekeeper into the upstairs master bedroom. 
</P>
<P>
 Pointing a chrome, 9-millimeter handgun at her head, "he asked her for cash," 
said Lt. Sam Allevato. "She stated she didn't have any. Then he asked her if 
she had a safe. . . . She was afraid. You can imagine, with your 2 1/2-year-old 
child in the house. She was obviously going to cooperate. He said, 'Don't do 
anything foolish.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The man kept looking at his watch, Allevato said, telling the woman she had 10 
minutes to comply with his demands, leading police to believe that he had been 
dropped off by an accomplice who would be returning to pick him up. 
</P>
<P>
 After the woman opened a bedroom floor safe and gave the man jewelry, Allevato 
said, both women and the child were tied with shoe laces, and the man fled. 
</P>
<P>
 As soon as she heard the front door close, the woman ran down the stairs and 
watched the man drive away in a black Toyota pickup, police said. With her 
wrists tied in front of her, she dialed 911. 
</P>
<P>
 Less than half an hour later, Allevato said, deputies spotted a black Toyota 
pickup on Interstate 5 and pulled it over at the Via Estrella exit. Finnan and 
Keenan were arrested without incident, and police said they seized two handguns 
and jewelry taken from the victim's safe. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they're amateurs," Allevato said of the men, both of whom identified 
themselves as carpenters. "I'm not sure if they were working nearby. . . . 
There's a lot of construction of new houses in the neighborhood." The custom 
residences are in the $700,000-$800,000 range. 
</P>
<P>
 No one was injured in the robbery. News of the event shocked neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 "We specifically chose Irvine and a gated community because we were scared to 
death of the L.A. area," said a neighbor who moved last year from Texas and who 
asked not to be identified. "That just really upsets me."

SANTA ANA SIGNS A RESOLUTION BACKING EFFORTS TO KEEP THE RAMS IN ANAHEIM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JON NALICK, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council passed a resolution urging the Los Angeles Rams to stay in 
Anaheim and cited the potential economic harm the team's departure could have 
on the community. 
</P>
<P>
 The council approved the resolution unanimously at its regular meeting Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The resolution urges support for the team's continued presence stating that 
"the Rams organization and player payrolls create a positive financial impact 
throughout the Orange County area." 
</P>
<P>
 Should the team leave, local charities that benefit from their association 
with players for fund-raising activities would suffer revenue losses. Further, 
businesses such as hotels and restaurants would see reduced trade and be forced 
to lay off employees. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams in May invoked an escape clause in their stadium lease that allows 
them to leave in 15 months, and the team has been fielding relocation offers 
from Baltimore, St. Louis and other cities that are offering new stadiums built 
with public funds.

NEW SALVO IN CUSTODY WARS; COURTS: HOW MUCH CAN A SINGLE PARENT RELY ON DAY 
CARE? HOW IMPORTANT IS CARE FROM A FAMILY MEMBER? A MICHIGAN CASE RAISES FEARS 
-- AND HACKLES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Just about the only thing the parties in Ireland vs. Smith agree upon is that 
the case was never intended to be an indictment of day care. What they were 
arguing about, Jennifer Ireland and Steven Smith say through their lawyers, was 
child support and custody -- nothing more. 
</P>
<P>
 But in ruling that 3-year-old Maranda Kate Ireland-Smith would be more likely 
to find "security . . . a safe place . . . (and) permanency" in the home of her 
father and paternal grandparents than in the day-care facility where she was 
sent by her college student mother, a Michigan judge has unleashed a full-force 
tempest. 
</P>
<P>
 Suddenly, the issues of single mothers who pursue their educations, children 
who are not "raised and supervised by blood relatives" and "child-parents" -- 
unwed mothers and fathers who bring offspring into the world before they are 
themselves of majority age -- were under a microscope. 
</P>
<P>
 "The mother's academic pursuits, although laudable, are demanding, and in 
order to complete her program it necessitates the leaving of the child for a 
considerable portion of its life in the care of strangers," Macomb County 
Circuit Court Judge Raymond Cashen wrote in explaining his decision to place 
Maranda in the custody of her 20-year-old father and his parents. 
</P>
<P>
 Cashen's conclusions followed nine days of hearings initiated when Ireland 
sought child support payments of $12 per week. Smith countersued, demanding 
custody of Maranda. It was the first appearance in court for Ireland and Smith, 
who are not married and who grew up in Mount Clemens, Mich., a working-class 
community not far from Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
 In an opinion released last week, the judge riled representatives from women's 
groups and child advocacy organizations when he added: "There is no way that a 
single parent, attending an academic program at an institution as prestigious 
as the University of Michigan, can do justice to their studies and to the 
raising of an infant child." Legal experts also expressed reservations about 
the ruling. 
</P>
<P>
 Kim Gandy, executive vice president of the National Organization for Women, 
called the decision shocking, adding: "It puts women who are doing the very 
best they can do for their children into a lose-lose-lose situation." 
</P>
<P>
 Leslie de Pietro, a counselor at the Family Resources Center at the University 
of Michigan, was equally appalled, asserting, "To me the biggest irony in this 
case is that the judge is essentially saying to single mothers, 'stay at home, 
go on welfare, let the taxpayers support you and be that kind of role model.' " 
</P>
<P>
 And Scott A. Altman, a family law professor at the University of Southern 
California, branded Cashen's action as "just simple, plain, old-fashioned 
gender discrimination," where the prevailing view is that "women should not be 
pursuing their education, and if they do, they should be punished." 
</P>
<P>
 With 15 days before the ruling was to take effect, 19-year-old Jennifer 
Ireland was in seclusion. Through her attorneys, who filed an emergency motion 
Monday, asking the Michigan Court of Appeals to block the judge's order, she 
declined interview requests. 
</P>
<P>
 But Smith, who lives with his parents while working part time in the local 
parks department and attending a community college, said he was overjoyed by 
the decision. 
</P>
<P>
 His only disappointment, Smith said by telephone from Mount Clemens, was that 
the wording of Cashen's opinion "makes it sound like a day-care issue, and it's 
not. There are many more facets to this case than just day care." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The "moral fitness" of both parties was, for example, an area that Cashen 
dwelt on heavily in his ruling. The judge described Ireland as "sexually 
indiscriminate as a young girl." Smith, Cashen said, "wasn't much better" -- 
adding that both parties "had a great fetish for partying" and that neither 
parent deserved "medals for their youthful activities." 
</P>
<P>
 Cashen also examined the consistency of Maranda's care to date, concluding 
that "the maternal grandparent was the staying force in the early raising of 
the child." He also credited Ireland's mother with having provided the bulk of 
Maranda's financial support since birth. 
</P>
<P>
 He failed, however, to pay credence to allegations of domestic violence raised 
by Ireland against Smith. "The parties in their youthful way apparently crashed 
or mauled one another," Cashen wrote. "It is all superfluous." 
</P>
<P>
 But while Cashen, who declined interview requests because he has jurisdiction 
over the case until Maranda is 18, dismissed the domestic violence issue as 
"not pertinent," Ireland's attorneys said the matter would figure prominently 
in the appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 No one disputed the basic facts of the case. Ireland was a 15-year-old high 
school sophomore when she became pregnant. Smith, then a 16-year-old student at 
the same parochial school, acknowledged paternity. They considered abortion, 
adoption and briefly had the child in foster care. Marriage was never an 
option. 
</P>
<P>
 While her mother served as Maranda's primary caregiver, Ireland finished high 
school as a cheerleader with a 4.0 grade point average. She earned a 
scholarship to the University of Michigan and moved to Ann Arbor. In Ireland's 
freshman year as a liberal arts major, Maranda spent about 35 hours per week in 
the care of Annette Johnson, a licensed child-care provider near the university 
campus. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's a sweet little girl," Johnson said of the child. "She's clean, she's 
neat, she's very cute -- and she's happy." 
</P>
<P>
 As for the suggestion that Maranda might somehow have suffered from being 
shuffled between home care at Johnson's house and weekends and evenings with 
the Ireland or Smith families, Johnson said: "That child is as far from 
neglected as I am from L.A." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But Cashen apparently thought otherwise. The 69-year-old judge called the 
day-care issue pivotal to his decision to award physical custody of Maranda to 
her father. 
</P>
<P>
 "Parents do raise children in a college setting," Cashen conceded, "but it is 
hoped that the cooperation and the efforts of both parents negate parental 
neglect. The plaintiff's situation is entirely different, however, (because) 
she must rely upon other people to take care of this child while she is in 
class, and it is pretty clear that the demands of academia are such that her 
time for her youngster would be circumscribed." 
</P>
<P>
 Julie Field, an attorney at the University of Michigan's Women and the Law 
Clinic, who is leading the legal team representing Ireland's appeal, said the 
"real problem" is that "the judge misunderstands what 'stability' is and what 
'the home' is." To the judge, Field said, "the home means you are in the same 
bedroom until you are 18. To most people, home is an emotional attachment, and 
the people you are with, not a place." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Cashen's opinion makes repeated reference to the value of permanence 
and "a regular home," Smith's attorney, Sharon Lee Edwards of Detroit, 
maintains that the case really centers around which parent is fit to care for 
Maranda. She called Smith "a young man who changed," rising to the demands of 
single fatherhood when many young men would rather be out partying. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who gives a hoot about day care?" Edwards said. Her client has arranged his 
college schedule so that he takes classes just two days a week, Edwards said, 
and his parents have provided Maranda with a frilly pink-and-white bedroom. 
When Smith is in school or at work, Edwards said, his mother will look after 
Maranda. 
</P>
<P>
 What happens if Smith marries or moves out of the family home is anybody's 
guess, Julie Field said. Visitation by her client was also left unresolved in 
Cashen's opinion, as was the prospect that Ireland might be asked to pay child 
support. 
</P>
<P>
 Field declined to speculate on her client's chances for success on appeal, a 
process that could stretch out indefinitely. Edwards thought her opponents did 
stand a chance of winning a stay of Cashen's custody order, but expressed 
confidence that her side would prevail on appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 "The case will be done on the evidence," said Edwards, who hailed the decision 
as the latest hallmark in the small but growing wave of men seeking physical 
custody of their children. "There is no question of our losing the case." 
</P>
<P>
 While Smith and his attorney described themselves as ecstatic over the 
decision, Field said Ireland is "alternately stoic and devastated." Ireland, 
who says she hopes to be an international lawyer, is "frustrated, and she's 
incredulous," Field said, "but not really angry." 
</P>
<P>
 Field said the case could serve as a precedent, helping to crystallize views 
about single mothers "who are attacked when they attempt to better themselves 
-- and accordingly, their children." 
</P>
<P>
 When the case goes to appeal, Field said, "it certainly will be an opportunity 
for the court to review day care, and the realities of life in 1994."

 I find odd things. Or maybe it's just that I've got time to notice stuff that 
others obliviously tread upon. Either way, I find odd things. 
</P>
<P>
 I've found: money (forty bucks lying in the gutter when I was in high school 
-- still a thrilling memory), love letters (I never knew anyone actually wrote 
words like "Oh, babe . . . "), a life-sized cardboard cutout of Homey the Clown 
from "In Living Color" (which became a Christmas present), poems, a reel of 
movie film (nothing lurid, sadly, just an auto advertisement), a black lace 
brassiere (size 34B), a 1950 grammar book from Van Nuys High School and kids' 
homework (a pretty good short story about "Larry, the Flying Whale"). 
</P>
<P>
 Lately, for reasons unknown, I have stumbled across a glut of curious items 
adrift in the streets. Whether they were deliberately cast off, lost or lifted 
out of Dumpsters by wayward wind gusts, I don't know. Each piece is a mystery. 
Finding one is like finding the last chapter of a novel; you are left wondering 
how things turned out the way they did. You know: Whatever made Van Helsing so 
angry with Count Dracula? 
</P>
<P>
 Take the pillows and the photo, for instance. They crowned one of those piles 
of earthquake-repair debris that have become as common on San Fernando Valley 
streets as bankrupt mini-malls (and a bit more attractive). The pillows were 
heart-shaped, delicate, quilted white satin trifles with frilly lace edges. 
</P>
<P>
 One was embroidered Nuestra boda -- Juan, and the other Nuestra boda -- Lupe. 
(Translation: "Our wedding.") Next to the pillows was a blown-up portrait of a 
handsome couple, presumably Juan and Lupe, in bridal gown and tuxedo, taken 
back in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
 The odds suggest, I'm sorry to say, that Lupe and Juan's boda did not have a 
happy ending. (But, then, maybe they were just redecorating.) 
</P>
<P>
 I was more puzzled by the circumstances of the therapy questionnaire. Crumpled 
under a cacao tree a few doors from my home, it consisted of multiple-choice 
questions aimed at isolating problems peculiar to Japanese Americans. It was 
apparently produced by a counseling center specializing in helping them. A 
sample question: 
</P>
<P>
 "In counseling, Japanese Americans are most likely to have complaints about A) 
situations at home, B) feeling isolated, C) American culture, D) sibling 
rivalries." 
</P>
<P>
 The subject filling out this particular form had circled B. I had two thoughts 
about this. First, I hoped that he or she hadn't felt so isolated as to fling 
the questionnaire into the street and give up on the counseling. Second, 
although I know nothing about the problems of Japanese Americans, I would have 
circled C. It's certainly the thing I complain about most. 
</P>
<P>
 In the same neighborhood (from the same counseling center?), I came across a 
bill from a psychotherapist to his patient -- really. 
</P>
<P>
 It was fluttering among some weeds, requesting $475 from the patient for five 
sessions at $95 each. The diagnosis: "300.02, Anxiety D/O." This, I discovered 
after a bit of research, is from the Diagnostic Statistical Manual of Mental 
Disorders III Revised, a guide used by therapists. 
</P>
<P>
 Section 300.02, in part, describes symptoms of "generalized anxiety disorder" 
as "shakiness, jitteriness, jumpiness, trembling, tension, muscle aches, 
fatigability, and inability to relax." What's more, there could be "eyelid 
twitch, furrowed brow, strained face, fidgeting," et cetera. 
</P>
<P>
 Hell, since the riots and earthquake, that describes pretty much everybody in 
town. The patient should have just come to me. I would have given a diagnosis 
for nothing and might have offered the following advice: A certain amount of 
anxiety might be relieved through the elimination of whopping therapy bills. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of my other recently retrieved items were minor histories of lives changed 
by the Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 The first, apparently dropped on a West L.A. sidewalk, was a postcard from a 
woman who had fled for Colorado after Jan. 17. She was writing to a guy she had 
briefly dated, asking if his apartment was still quake-disheveled and declaring 
that she was very grateful to be in Colorado -- even though it was snowing 
(this was April). 
</P>
<P>
 The writer closed by saying she would "give you a call sometime." I thought 
that the guy shouldn't bank on it as I delivered the card to its proper 
destination, musing over how many potential romances -- even marriages and 
offspring -- might have been canceled by that quake. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The other item, residing in the dust and soot along Ventura Boulevard, was 
downright tragic. It was a U.S. Small Business Administration letter from the 
Arcadia Disaster Field Office to a Sherman Oaks woman -- denying her request 
for an emergency loan. Covered, symbolically enough, with dirty footprints. 
</P>
<P>
 Handwritten scribbles on the sheet told the woman's frustrating story: 
addresses of banks, an insurance agency phone number, names of various loan 
officers. The request had been denied on the basis of "a lack of repayment 
ability." 
</P>
<P>
 The woman's income was $620 per month, with monthly payments of $470, leaving 
$150 per month for living expenses. This correspondence, I'm fairly confident, 
was discarded in disgust, if not despair.

 Then I found a remarkable item once belonging to Egbert (not his real name). 
I've never met Egbert, but I'll tell you, he's one smart son of a gun. 
</P>
<P>
 Pages 1 and 2 of Egbert's resume lay, torn in half, on a sidewalk. The guy's 
credits are absolutely colossal. He was a postdoctoral scholar at UCLA School 
of Medicine, Department of Radiological Sciences, Division of Nuclear Medicine 
and Biophysics. 
</P>
<P>
 He researched something called Positron Emission Tomography, and has a "strong 
and diversified background" in (deep breath): organic chemistry, analytical 
chemistry, biochemistry, pharmaceutical chemistry, radiopharmaceutical 
chemistry, neurochemistry, immunochemistry and medicinal chemistry. (Yes, but 
does he know anything about chemistry?) 
</P>
<P>
 Just how Egbert's resume got torn and tossed to the four smoggy air currents, 
I don't know. But I'll say this: Anybody who doesn't hire him is a fool. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The last item was found, I report with some unease, outside an elementary 
school playground. It was the press release/biography of Atlantic Records 
recording artist Melissa Ferrick, who had just released her first album, 
"Massive Blur." The bio trumpeted that "joy, passion, anger, love, Angst, 
frustration, and self-doubt" (right, can't forget that self-doubt) all figure 
into Melissa's cathartic repertoire. 
</P>
<P>
 Gee, that sounded pretty impressive. Then I noticed a rather remarkable quote 
from the 22-year-old artist, at the top of Page 1. In part, it went like this: 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not like what I write is the result of the fact that I don't have a 
(penis). Sometimes I play guitar like I have a (penis), and sometimes I sing 
like I do." 
</P>
<P>
 I don't quite know what to say about this, except that I'm not sure what it 
means. What's more, it seems a weird boast to make in this age of feminism. The 
only woman I can think of who might have accurately made such a claim, had she 
been singing at a key moment, is Lorena Bobbitt. 
</P>
<P>
 It occurred to me that had I found this release outside my own elementary 
school many years ago, my pals and I would have fallen down laughing for about 
a week. I wondered if today's kids would be similarly shocked and amused. 
</P>
<P>
 Probably not. At least not in a city where you can find abandoned black lace 
brassieres.

ILLUSIONS OF GRANDEUR; WHY ARE ALL THOSE PEOPLE SQUINTING AT WILD PATTERNS ON 
CARDS AND BOOKS? THE BETTER TO SEE MAGIC EYE'S CAMOUFLAGED 3-D CREATIONS, OF 
COURSE. BUT YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE PATIENCE -- AND HEALTHY DEPTH PERCEPTION.

<P>
 Every day at lunch, gaggles of corporate types leave their Downtown high-rises 
hoping to see a vision or two. 
</P>
<P>
 Decked out in shoulder pads and pin-striped suits, they swarm the card racks 
at Mr. G's Expressions, where they cross their eyes for hours and exclaim that 
they've seen bullfrogs, fish and even, on occasion, Elvis. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes we just make fun of them because they have these cards stuck up to 
their noses for half an hour," says Patty Aleman, manager of the gift shop at 
Seventh Market Place. 
</P>
<P>
 They're staring at stereograms, an optical oddity that once entertained the 
court of Queen Victoria and has re-emerged in the computer age as a 
multimillion-dollar global phenomenon. 
</P>
<P>
 The sun never sets on this fad's formidable empire. Through Magic Eye, by far 
the most popular line of stereogram products, images have been embossed on 
everything from Pepsi cans in the United Kingdom to rice-paper fans in Japan. 
"Magic Eye" and "Magic Eye II" -- hard-bound, glossy coffee-table books full of 
the camouflaged 3-D creations -- reside comfortably on the New York Times 
bestseller list and have inspired a host of imitators. 
</P>
<P>
 The folks at Magic Eye even have a '90s version of the Babe Ruth story. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Gregorek, the marketer chiefly responsible for its success, says he knows 
of a Massachusetts boy who sliced his foot in a lawn mower accident. While at 
the hospital, he found that staring at hidden images of sea gulls and flowers 
helped ease his pain. 
</P>
<P>
 "He calls it his healing book," says Gregorek, who runs the marketing firm 
Blue Moon in Ramsey, N.J. "It's really mystical." 
</P>
<P>
 And for some, it's really mystifying. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a totem pole. It's definitely a totem pole," proclaims Fred Patton, 45, 
a manager at the nearby First Interstate Bank during a noontime sojourn to Mr. 
G's. Searching for a card to send a friend who is leaving to work in Saudi 
Arabia, Patton settled on a collage of world flags. Far from a totem pole, the 
hidden image turned out to be the United Nations building. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just got contacts," Patton says a little sheepishly. "I usually get these 
right away." 
</P>
<P>
 On the surface, the waves of lines and color fit somewhere between abstract 
Expressionism and the opening credits to "Outer Limits." But for those 
possessing patience and healthy depth perception, the images create the 
sensation of moving from two dimensions into three. 
</P>
<P>
 At least, that's what's supposed to happen. 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond the 5% with visual impairments such as strabismus and astigmatism, 
about half the population can't see the images because of mental blocks, 
Gregorek says. 
</P>
<P>
 Children seem to have the easiest time. Used to staring at the wallpaper as 
they go to sleep or daydreaming as they skip over cracks in the sidewalk, kids 
have the kind of skewed visual sense that Magic Eye demands, its creators say. 
</P>
<P>
 Photographers, artists and graphic designers lead that portion of the 
population who just don't get it, Gregorek says. "It's understandable. They are 
more or less locked in to their own way of seeing the world." 
</P>
<P>
 Magic Eye is the brainchild of hippie-turned-entrepreneur Tom Baccei, 50, who 
says he now makes more money than "a good shortstop." 
</P>
<P>
 "The dots have been very, very good to me," he acknowledges. 
</P>
<P>
 A spirit of inspired lunacy pervades Baccei's N.E. Thing Enterprises, the 
10-person Bedford, Mass., company where Magic Eye stereograms are created for 
everything from Brookville neckties to newspaper comics pages. 
</P>
<P>
 When Cheerios executives visited the company to discuss an upcoming promotion, 
computer designers surprised them with a subliminal joke. A stereogram on the 
front of a box pictured a bowl of cereal which, upon prolonged staring, 
revealed the honey-nut O's in the form of the words "Buy me." 
</P>
<P>
 "They said 'Oh, no, we can't do that,' " Baccei recalls. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, Baccei didn't so much invent stereograms as stumble upon a 
curiosity that has lingered for more than a century. 
</P>
<P>
 The public's fascination with 3-D images started long before audiences adorned 
the famous green-and-red glasses for such B-movies as "House of Wax." 
</P>
<P>
 Invented by Sir Charles Wheatstone in 1838, the pictures became a favorite 
plaything of the elite, amusing the likes of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert, 
according to "Stereogram" (Cadence Books, 1994), a collection of essays on the 
subject. Dali, Duchamp and Escher also became aficionados of the illusions -- 
dual images that, when merged through a stereoscope, tricked the eye into 
seeing depth. 
</P>
<P>
 The technology lay dormant -- of interest to a handful of ophthalmologists and 
trinket collectors -- until 1959, when Dr. Bela Julesz, a cognitive 
psychologist at Bell Telephone Laboratories in New Jersey, used computers to 
make stereograms visible to the naked eye. 
</P>
<P>
 In their current form, the images could be a kaleidoscopic flashback from Tom 
Baccei's psychedelic past. During the '70s, Baccei traversed the country in the 
Great Green Tortoise, part of the "underground" bus fleet that took free 
spirits from Boston to San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to stints as a blues musician and cabinetmaker, Baccei taught in 
an open classroom in Boston, where projects included producing a rock album and 
field trips to the ancient Indian ruins of Central America. 
</P>
<P>
 But as he approached 40, he realized that "alternative lifestyles wouldn't 
make for a comfortable retirement." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Baccei says, the very attributes that caused him to rebel against the 
system have turned him into a good capitalist. "I've led a varied life," he 
says. "Consequently, I'm really in touch with what the Everyman will like." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990 he saw a stereogram in an obscure electronics magazine. With a little 
high-tech wizardry of his own, Baccei created an ad for his electronics company 
in which he hid a number in a sea of computer-generated dots. The caption read: 
"Finding a bug in your computer is as easy as finding a number in the picture 
above. Once you find it, it jumps right out at you." 
</P>
<P>
 The business started there. Baccei lived on mail orders and word-of-mouth 
until he met Gregorek, who had been turned on to the images by a friend who 
faxed a work of Baccei's that appeared in an airline magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 But early attempts to sell American executives on the idea fell victim to 
timeworn images of the national attention span -- you know, basically a 
Chihuahua on Vivarin. 
</P>
<P>
 "They said 'Mark, I got 30 microseconds to sell this. Can't you make it 
easier?" Gregorek recalls. "They sold the public short." 
</P>
<P>
 So they contracted with a toy company in Japan, where businessmen were already 
addicted to the images they saw in America's in-flight magazines. An appearance 
on "Narahudo," a TV show about global oddities, cemented its popularity in the 
land of the rising sun. 
</P>
<P>
 American marketers were forced to eat their words. The public was ready for a 
fad that didn't offer immediate gratification. 
</P>
<P>
 Global revenue for Magic Eye now exceeds $100 million, Gregorek and Baccei 
say, with the books alone selling more than 4 million copies in the United 
States. In Germany, Der Spiegel magazine reports that "Magic Eye" and "Magic 
Eye II" are the biggest sellers of the past 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
 If the volumes of mail Magic Eye receives is any indication, the public 
remains eager for more. Sometimes, however, things get excessive. 
</P>
<P>
 One writer, characterized by Baccei as a "devil worshiper," mailed in a 
rambling diatribe in which he linked the optical illusions to "alien 
crucifixions." Baccei was concerned enough to call the writer's hometown police 
department. Harmless, the cops told Baccei, but they agreed to check up on him. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, they called back and told me that the guy had gotten much worse," he 
recalls with a laugh. "They said, 'He keeps running around the house and 
pointing to these pieces of paper with dots on them and claiming he sees frogs 
and trees.' "

'90S FAMILY; PARENTS ARE GETTING BETTER AT JUGGLING WORK, FAMILY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELIZABETH MEHREN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Less than a decade ago, the phrasefamily" was little known out side the 
academic world. So when Boston University's Center on Work and Family undertook 
a study in 1985 of the particular forms of stress faced by working parents, the 
findings were considered noteworthy. 
</P>
<P>
 Seven years later, the research team, led by Center on Work and Family 
Director Bradley K. Googins, returned to the large Northeastern electronics 
company where the original survey was conducted. 
</P>
<P>
 Working parents have learned to better manage the competing demands of work 
and family, the follow-up investigation revealed, but life for working families 
has also become more stressed and harried. 
</P>
<P>
 In results released last week, the new study of job / family stress showed: 
</P>
<P>
 * While only 25% of parents in 1985 said they shared child care equally with 
their spouses, 49% said they did so in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 * In 1992, 80% of parents said they felt comfortable always or most of the 
time with their child-care arrangements -- compared to just 42% in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
 * Men in 1992 spent five more hours per week on home chores than in 1985. But 
for women in the latest survey, home chores accounted for about 13 more hours 
per week than in the earlier study. 
</P>
<P>
 * Children in 1992 were also doing more work in the home, up to 6.6 hours per 
week from 4.2 hours per week in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
 Morale and job satisfaction plummeted in the newest study, reflecting 
deteriorating work and economic environments. But "feelings of security" 
generated by employer-provided work / family options were up, Googins said. 
</P>
<P>
 "People may hate their jobs," he said, "but they grit their teeth and put up 
with it" in exchange for work / family benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 But having had a taste of work / family balance, many workers longed for more. 
In 1992, 56% of respondents wanted more family time -- as opposed to 47% in 
1985. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the juggling act seemed less daunting the second time researchers 
looked at it. When given a list 12 activities -- including adjusting work 
schedules for family time and avoiding rush hour -- respondents reported that 
eight of the 12 were easier to do than in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
 But even with almost a decade of work / family mileage behind them, nearly 
half of the workers surveyed this time said that always or most of the time, 
they had to rush and didn't have enough time for themselves. Twenty-seven 
percent of parents also said they worry always or most of the time about their 
children while at work. Another quarter of workers surveyed reported that their 
work was hindered by child-care responsibilities. 
</P>
<P>
 About 800 employees responded to questionnaires in both studies. Googins said 
the findings from this large corporation, which asked researchers to omit its 
name, probably reflected the experience of many big businesses. The company had 
no official work / family policy when Googins' team conducted its 1985 
interviews. By 1988, a corporation-wide work / life initiative had been 
launched, providing benefits that ranged from child-care referral to lunchtime 
seminars on work and family.

'90S FAMILY; SEPARATION ANXIETY; FEW PARTINGS ARE EASY. BUT WHEN A CHILD HEADS 
TO CAMP OR COLLEGE EVEN SECURE PARENTS CAN EXPERIENCE A SPECIAL KIND OF STRESS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Twenty years as a camp director did not prepare Robin Sprague for this 
summer's "Maalox moment" when she hand-delivered her 10-year-old daughter, 
Lindsay, to sleep-away camp in Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
 "Two other sets of parents had come and gone and I was still there," confessed 
the Arizona mother of three. Having run out of clothes to unpack and counselors 
to introduce, Sprague finally left, saying: "Honey, I don't think you want me 
here at dinner time." 
</P>
<P>
 Lindsay Sprague is among an estimated 1 million children packing duffel bags 
this summer for sleep-away camp. A few weeks later, 1 million or so teen-agers 
will collect their worldly goods and leave home for their freshman year of 
college. These are proud moments for parents, marking their children's growing 
independence and maturity. Why then do many parents feel like riding along on 
the camp bus or moving into their kid's freshman dorm? 
</P>
<P>
 "It's normal for a parent to feel some degree of anxiety in sending a child 
away, especially with the increased concern these days about child abuse," said 
Becca Cowen Johnson, a Bellingham, Wash., psychologist who counsels camp-bound 
children.  
</P>
<P>
 "But for some parents, sending a child to camp can elicit the same responses 
as that traumatic first day of kindergarten. Parents who want their kids to 
miss them are relying on their children too much." 
</P>
<P>
 Parents of late-summer campers need to be aware that post-camp blues are 
common. "All of a sudden, children are back home without their friends and the 
(college-aged) counselors who became their heroes," said Orange County camp 
consultant Cheri Evans. "It's a wonderful time for parents to encourage their 
children to communicate about their experiences and to discuss whether they 
want to consider camp for the next year." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Sprague knows that camp will be a growing experience for her daughter 
and an opportunity to spend more time with her younger children, she still 
worries. "What if it starts lightning when Lindsay is on a hike? Will she know 
what to do?" Sprague wondered. Adding to Sprague's anxiety is the need to 
communicate the worsening health of Lindsay's grandmother. 
</P>
<P>
 Illness and loss of grandparents sometimes coincide with camp and college 
separations, and they play a role in the emotions parents experience. "When 
children leave home, parents can suddenly feel abandoned and very much alone 
from above and below," said psychiatrist Mark Goulston, president of the Direct 
Conflict Resolution Group in Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
 Goulston said even the most secure parents are tempted to relive their youth 
through their children -- in effect getting a second scoop of ice cream. But 
parents can carry this too far and become overly dependent. "Spouses can be so 
invested in their kids that they forget to talk to each other," Goulston said. 
"If we haven't stayed current in our involvement with our mate, we can feel a 
shyness and a loss of intimacy when left alone with our husband or wife." 
</P>
<P>
 College brings a realization that the family is never going to be quite the 
same. "Waves of different emotions go over me," said Linda Mack of Manhattan 
Beach, whose older daughter, Laura, leaves for UC Berkeley this month. "It's 
like the beginning of the end of our family -- as it was. Most likely, Laura 
will be back at Christmas, but who knows about next summer? She won't be a 
permanent resident here anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 The Macks had a college warm-up when Laura traveled to Eastern Europe as an 
exchange student before her junior year at Mira Costa High School. Linda Mack 
remembers feeling a little bit of emptiness, tempered by the knowledge that her 
daughter was coming back. "Laura couldn't wait to get out on her own," Mack 
recalled, "but she hadn't reached New York before she was calling us." 
</P>
<P>
 Freshman year can also be hard on younger brothers and sisters -- so much so 
that many colleges encourage close siblings to visit. "Laura's sister is 
already making plans to take over the bathroom," Mack said. "But it's going to 
hit her. She doesn't yet realize how much they will miss each other." 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes parents make the college transition very smoothly -- even 
experiencing a sense of liberation. Last fall, Joel Bernstein of Tarzana filled 
up two cars with "everything under the sun" and drove daughter Julia to UC 
Santa Barbara for her freshman year. "It's a release on life," said the 
attorney and marathon runner. "I run further and faster now than I ever have." 
</P>
<P>
 Each time a child separates -- whether it's for kindergarten, sleep-away camp, 
college or marriage -- parents can expect to feel a mixture of relief and 
sadness. Adjust and let go, experts say. And in the process, try to resist 
turning your kid's room into a mausoleum. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't take what feels like a personal loss personally," Goulston said. "Suck 
back the tears and don't make your child feel guilty. In the next several 
years, your child will relate to you as a friend and gravitate toward you 
because he or she enjoys your company."

REAL LIFE: '90S FAMILY; FINDING STRENGTH TO WILL YOURSELF BACK IN CONTROL;

 Human nature, as Katharine Hepburn imperiously informed Humphrey Bogart in 
"The African Queen," is what we are meant to rise above. But how, many ask 
these days, do we rise above the disturbing, unbidden impulses to strike or 
degrade someone we love?  
</P>
<P>
 The answer, it would seem, is "with difficulty and determination." 
</P>
<P>
 Those who have succeeded say it takes much more than a timeout and counting to 
10. Or reading a chapter in a book. Or even understanding what went wrong in 
your own childhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Holcomb, 60, of Los Angeles, said his life changed dramatically in two 
years with a combination of approaches, relying heavily on new ways of thinking 
he learned and practiced in a free, self-help program called Recovery Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 Group members call it "will training." 
</P>
<P>
 Holcomb, a retired instrument technician, said he never hit his wife but often 
felt like it. Small arguments such as how to do laundry would escalate until 
the couple were fighting about who was going to be the boss, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd take out my temper by hitting the wall or putting my fist through the 
screen. I'd raise my voice and yell and bring her to the point she'd be in 
tears and go into another room and sulk." 
</P>
<P>
 His wife, Jo-Ann, said he never trusted her and restricted her activities. She 
never knew when he would lose his temper, but it was mostly over little things. 
</P>
<P>
 Holcomb had been seeing psychiatrists most of his life for depression, rooted 
in childhood abuse. When he changed jobs, his new insurance company required 
him to enroll in a self-help group if he wanted to continue psychotherapy. He 
chose Recovery Inc., founded in 1937 and based on principles of psychiatrist 
Abraham A. Low. Now there are about 1,000 weekly meetings across the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
 In meetings, members learn Low's philosophy and share how they apply it in 
their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Holcomb said he found out that "I was being perfectionistic, which is 
counterproductive to having peace in the family and peace in myself. 
</P>
<P>
 "By the same token, everyone around me has to be perfect too. You end up 
isolated when you're like that. Nobody likes you. You're always finding fault. 
You end up only lonely." 
</P>
<P>
 He said he learned to lower his standards. He said he now accepts himself as 
average and has stopped trying to measure up to his media role models of 
manhood: a combination of John Wayne, Rambo and the Robert Young character of 
"Father Knows Best." 
</P>
<P>
 Holcomb said that when he starts to get worked up, he now wills himself to 
think, "This is distressing, but not dangerous," or "People do things that 
annoy us, but not to annoy us." 
</P>
<P>
 His wife said he is a different person. "He doesn't have that dominating need. 
He trusts me. . . . He's the person I saw 29 years ago." 
</P>
<P>
 Members say that in will training, they learn to control thoughts and 
impulses, and to be suspicious of feelings they cannot control. 
</P>
<P>
 "Feelings lie and deceive. They tell of danger when there is no danger," said 
Randy Walburger, 48, of Los Angeles, who has been going to Recovery meetings 
for six years. "Your brain can only have one thought at a time. If it is one of 
danger, then your life is going to reflect that thinking. If your thoughts are 
of resentment and judgment, your life will reflect that." 
</P>
<P>
 Walburger, who has had a lifelong problem with anger, said he is now happily 
married to his third wife. He has also been helped by Prozac-like medication. 
But through the group practice, he learned to stop judging others, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one does it for you. You do it," he said. "There's no professional to tell 
you you're not doing it right. And no cult leader. There's no religion 
involved. And we don't have to say we're powerless and only God can help us 
out. 
</P>
<P>
 "Only we can help us out."

RELAX, DRIFT AWAY AND ENJOY PLAYING THE FOOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANDREW BROWNSTEIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For the caffeinated legions who see in stereograms nothing more than 
television static, here's a good place to start: Relax. Open your mind. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to let yourself drift," says Tom Baccei, the former hippie who 
created the images. 
</P>
<P>
 Another good idea is to practice in private, away from the true believers who 
will be eager to flaunt their perceptual superiority. This can be quite 
embarrassing, as Magic Eye's chief marketer, Mark Gregorek, explains: "After a 
few minutes, the question inevitably arises: 'Am I making a total fool of 
myself with this book up my nose?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Gregorek says it took him three weeks of staring at one of Baccei's pictures 
before he finally saw the hidden images. 
</P>
<P>
 "One day, I was on the phone, leaning back in my chair," says Gregorek, 
president of Blue Moon, a marketing firm in Ramsey, N.J. "I looked out the 
window and then 'Bam!' it popped out at me, a World War II bomber. It was like, 
really cool." 
</P>
<P>
 For those unwilling to invest that much time, Baccei recommends the following 
approach: Hold the image up to your nose and let it blur. Move it away very 
slowly, an inch every two seconds or so. While keeping focus, try to get two 
parts of the picture to coalesce, as if you are looking through it. Without 
warning, an image such as men fishing in a pond will seem a foot deep, 
revealing a 3-D flying fish. 
</P>
<P>
 The American Academy of Ophthalmologists has a second option: Place a piece of 
transparent glass in front of the image. Stand about four feet away and stare 
at the reflection. Eventually, you'll perceive depth, followed by the 3-D 
image. 
</P>
<P>
 And if that doesn't work, you can always break your mother's cardinal rule. "I 
tell people to cross their eyes," says Patty Aleman, manager of Mr. G's 
Expressions, a Downtown gift shop that carries several Magic Eye products. "It 
always works." 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe so, but don't push it, says Dr. Sandy Feldman of San Diego, a spokesman 
for the academy. "Your mother was wrong. It's not dangerous. Of course, like 
any muscle, your eye is subject to strain, so you shouldn't do it for too 
long." 
</P>
<P>
 He adds: "Don't tell my mother I said that." ANDREW BROWNSTEIN

FIRST INTERSTATE TO BUY VENTURA'S BANK OF A. LEVY; FINANCE: THE ACQUISITION 
EXTENDS THE LOS ANGELES-BASED INSTITUTION'S FORAY INTO THE FAST-GROWING REGIONS 
OF THE WEST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 First Interstate Bancorp extended its foray into the fastest-growing regions 
of the West on Tuesday with the purchase of the Bank of A. Levy, a 112-year-old 
institution that played a key role in transforming once-rural Ventura County 
into a budding metropolis. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles-based First Interstate said it will buy the holding company of 
Bank of A. Levy, Ventura County's oldest independent bank, for $86.5 million in 
First Interstate stock. 
</P>
<P>
 The sale of such mid-size, independent banks to far bigger institutions has 
seemed almost preordained in recent years, but some Ventura County civic 
leaders and Levy's own customers immediately began mourning the sale. 
</P>
<P>
 They worried that a banking behemoth such as First Interstate -- California's 
second-largest financial institution -- will not offer the same homespun 
service and community involvement that Levy has provided for more than a 
century. 
</P>
<P>
 "In some ways, the Bank of A. Levy could be deemed the founder of Oxnard," 
Oxnard Mayor Manuel Lopez said. "The bank was the lifeblood of the city. They 
were born with the city and they helped the city develop." 
</P>
<P>
 Added Barbara Dick, a store clerk who has banked with Levy for more than 40 
years: "So many times you come to the Bank of A. Levy, they call you by name. I 
just hate to see the smaller businesses taken over by big corporations." 
</P>
<P>
 The deal marks First Interstate's second purchase in Ventura County this year. 
In January, it completed the $23-million acquisition of First State Bank of the 
Oaks, a five-branch bank headquartered in Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 "This acquisition . . . offers us an outstanding opportunity to expand our 
position in one of the state's fastest-growing markets," said First Interstate 
Chief Executive Bruce G. Willison, noting Ventura County's rapid growth and 
high household income. 
</P>
<P>
 First Interstate has bought more than a dozen smaller, community-oriented 
banks over the past 18 months. Most of those acquisitions have been in 
fast-growing suburban areas, as it tries to expand beyond the saturated markets 
of Los Angeles and Orange counties. 
</P>
<P>
 The purchase is expected to be completed in early 1995, First Interstate said. 
</P>
<P>
 First Interstate has only eight branch offices in Ventura County, while Levy 
boasts 17 and about 275 employees. However, some branches will be closed and an 
undetermined number of workers will be laid off at both Levy and First 
Interstate as the two banks consolidate operations, First Interstate spokesman 
Ken Preston said. The sale of Bank of A. Levy, based in the city of Ventura, 
brings an important chapter of Ventura County's history to a close. 
</P>
<P>
 The bank was founded in 1882 by Achille Levy, a French immigrant and dry-goods 
merchant whose early bank customers ranged from small-business owners to the 
farmers who grew fruits and vegetables in Ventura County's fertile soil. 
</P>
<P>
 One of Levy's daughters eventually married into the Milligan family of Ventura 
County, and leadership of the bank has been held by the Milligans ever since. 
Marshall C. Milligan, the bank's current president, is the fourth generation of 
his family to run the company. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, Milligan expressed some sadness about having to sell the bank. 
But, he added, economic factors have made it increasingly difficult for small 
banks to compete with big ones, and the new technology that many customers want 
is expensive for all but the largest institutions to bankroll. 
</P>
<P>
 "We see the trend in the industry not favoring smaller banks," Milligan said. 
"This is the final chapter in a long story full of history and tradition, so 
we're sad to see it end." First Interstate's Acquisitions 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles-based First Interstate Bancorp, parent of First Interstate Bank, 
has gone on a buying spree over the past 18 months. About half its acquisitions 
have been in fast-growing California markets. 05,31,16,12,12,09 Price Assets

$400-MILLION CLAIM AGAINST HAMMER ESTATE DISMISSED; COURTS: DECISION RESOLVES 
ONE PHASE OF A BITTER FAMILY DISPUTE INVOLVING NIECE OF TYCOON'S LATE WIFE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK LEE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a surprisingly swift resolution to a bitter and prolonged family legal 
dispute over oil millions and valuable artworks, a Los Angeles County Superior 
Court judge Tuesday threw out a $400-million claim by the niece of Armand 
Hammer's late wife that sought half the late oil tycoon's estate, including art 
now housed in the UCLA-managed museum that bears his name. 
</P>
<P>
 The judgment invalidates the claims against the estate of Hammer, the 
controversial Russian-born philanthropist and entrepreneur who built Occidental 
Petroleum Corp., by Joan Weiss, the niece and sole heir of the millionaire's 
wife, Frances, who died in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit was filed in 1990, five months before Hammer's death that year at age 
92. It alleged that Hammer improperly persuaded his wife to sign away her 
interest in art and other property acquired during the Hammers' 33-year 
marriage. 
</P>
<P>
 During the course of that marriage, Hammer amassed a formidable art 
collection, in part with Occidental's money. Near the end of his life, he built 
a museum in Westwood to house it -- his legacy to the city of Los Angeles and a 
monument to himself. The art in the museum is valued at several hundred million 
dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, attorneys for the Hammer estate were jubilant at the quick 
judgment, which came after only two days of trial. 
</P>
<P>
 "Joan has lost her case against Hammer, against Occidental and against the 
museum, pending appeals," said Arthur Groman, Hammer's longtime friend and 
attorney and an Occidental board member whose firm handled the defense. 
</P>
<P>
 Weiss may appeal the judgment. Neither Weiss nor her attorney was available 
for comment. Officials at Occidental declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Resolution of the Weiss claims appears to lift the uncertainty that has been 
hanging over the UCLA/Armand Hammer Museum of Art and Cultural Center since 
Hammer's death. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, UCLA took over management of the museum, whose building is owned by 
Occidental and whose collection is owned by the Armand Hammer Foundation, to 
which Hammer left the bulk of his estate.  
</P>
<P>
 As part of the agreement, the museum set aside roughly a third of the art 
collection for possible sale to cover any liability that may arise from Weiss' 
suit, museum Director Henry T. Hopkins said. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, the museum has said, it will sell only one artwork, albeit one of the 
collection's most valuable: the so-called Codex Hammer, a hand-illustrated 
scientific manuscript of Renaissance master Leonardo da Vinci, valued at $10 
million. That sale will proceed as planned Nov. 11, Hopkins said. 
</P>
<P>
 The judgment involves in a case that generated 250,000 documents and 5,000 
pages of depositions, Groman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other allegations, Weiss charged in court papers that Hammer engaged in 
a longtime extramarital relationship with the woman who was to become the chief 
fund-raiser for the museum before UCLA stepped in. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit originally named the Hammer estate, the Armand Hammer Living Trust, 
the Hammer foundation, Occidental Petroleum Corp. and the museum. The oil 
company and museum were dropped from the suit last month. 
</P>
<P>
 This week, despite the mountain of documents, Weiss' attorney mounted a case 
that consisted mainly of stipulations to the date and duration of the Hammers' 
marriage and the amount of Hammer's income, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Before Hammer's attorneys could begin their defense, Judge Henry W. Shatford 
of the Los Angeles County Superior Court, Central-West District, granted a 
defense motion to dismiss the claim.  
</P>
<P>
 "The plaintiff was not able to put up a shred of evidence supporting the 
contention" that Hammer had deceived his wife, Shatford said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys for Hammer's estate and charitable foundation will go back to court 
on Monday, this time to pursue a counterclaim against Weiss to invalidate 
Frances Hammer's will and seek millions in damages, said Daniel M. Petrocelli, 
a partner in Groman's firm and the chief defense attorney.

ICN PLANNING MERGER WITH THREE AFFILIATES; REORGANIZATION: ANALYSTS APPLAUD 
O.C. DRUG MAKER'S PROPOSAL, WHICH WOULD ELIMINATE DUPLICATION AND REDUCE TAXES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 To streamline its operations, ICN Pharmaceuticals Inc. said Tuesday that it 
plans to merge with its three affiliates, creating a new company with $500 
million in annual sales. 
</P>
<P>
 If shareholders and federal regulators approve the proposal, the new company, 
which would keep the name ICN Pharmaceuticals, would begin trading on the New 
York Stock Exchange this fall. 
</P>
<P>
 "Truly, this will increase value for all our shareholders," said Milan Panic, 
chairman of ICN, who would head the consolidated company as chairman, president 
and chief executive officer. Adam Jerney, now chief operating officer, would 
keep that position. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal would merge ICN with SPI Pharmaceuticals Inc., Viratek Inc. and 
ICN Biomedicals Inc. ICN is now part-owner of the other three companies. All 
four are based in Costa Mesa and are publicly traded. Panic is chairman of all 
four. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts and shareholders applauded the proposal as a positive move for ICN, 
which vowed earlier this year, after winning a bitter proxy battle against 
dissident stockholder Rafi M. Kahn, to be more attentive to investors' 
concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's an outstanding program. Given the uneven management this company 
has shown, I'm surprised they've come up with something as intelligent as 
this," said Seth Glickenhaus, a partner in Glickenhaus & Co. of New York, an 
investment fund that owns a chunk of ICN stock. "It focuses their attention in 
one direction instead of four, reduces debt costs and has substantial tax 
savings." 
</P>
<P>
 Even Kahn praised the plan. "I view this as a very positive development for 
shareholders of all the ICN family of stocks," said Kahn, a former Beverly 
Hills stockbroker who launched his crusade for control of ICN last year, 
blaming Panic for wasting corporate funds on luxuries and paying himself 
millions of dollars a year while the company performed poorly. 
</P>
<P>
 Specifically, the merger would save money by streamlining management to 
eliminate duplication, reducing accounting and auditing fees, and lowering 
income taxes. It would also reduce debt; ICN officials said Tuesday that much 
of the four companies' long-term debt would be refinanced at lower interest 
rates. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the merger plan, which has not yet been filed with the Securities and 
Exchange Commission, ICN and Viratek stockholders would receive one share of 
the new company for about two of their current shares. SPI stockholders would 
receive one new share for each old share, and ICN Biomedicals' investors would 
get one new share for five existing shares. 
</P>
<P>
 The new company would have a 17-member board, 15 of whom would be outside 
directors. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday's news did little to affect ICN's or the affiliates' stock prices, 
which had risen sharply Monday in anticipation of the announcement. 
</P>
<P>
 ICN shares fell 37.5 cents to close at $10.12 in New York Stock Exchange 
trading. SPI Pharmaceuticals lost $1.25 to close at $19.75 a share, and Viratek 
Inc. slid 75 cents to $10 a share on the American Stock Exchange. ICN 
Biomedicals was up 37.5 cents on the American Exchange to close at $3.875 a 
share. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts and brokers said they are encouraged that ICN's management has 
started considering its investors. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the first time in my memory where management, after going through a 
brutal proxy battle . . . listened to what shareholders were saying and 
implemented plans and programs," said Dave Harvey, a broker with Princor 
Financial Services Corp. in Odessa, Tex., and an owner of ICN stock for more 
than five years. 
</P>
<P>
 Other analysts said the company's long-term success hinges not so much on 
management changes as on whether it receives approval from the federal 
government to sell its flagship drug, Ribavirin, as a treatment for hepatitis 
C, a liver disease. The potential market for such a drug, analysts say, could 
be as much as $500 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
 ICN spokesman David Calef said the company submitted its application to the 
Food and Drug Administration on June 1, and it is under review. 
</P>
<P>
 Dennis Roth, an analyst with the brokerage Northeast Securities in Great 
Falls, Va., said Ribavirin "has very interesting possibilities if they can get 
it approved. . . . It will be a real boon to the company." 
</P>
<P>
 Jack Hicks, a shareholder from Lufkin, Tex., who attended ICN's annual meeting 
earlier this year to push for changes, said he is pleased. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody I've talked to is elated," he said. "In combining these four 
companies, they've come up with an outstanding plan." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Hicks suggested that the consolidation might make ICN more attractive 
as a takeover target. 
</P>
<P>
 Chairman Panic agreed. "We're vulnerable," he said. "But we've demonstrated a 
record of hard work and toughness, maybe excessive toughness. I've fought many 
battles -- from Bosnia to proxy battles. We're known as good fighters." 
</P>
<P>
 Panic has been a controversial, high-profile figure. In 1991, he agreed to pay 
$600,000 to settle a civil complaint from the Food and Drug Administration, 
which said he improperly promoted the company's drug Virazole as a treatment 
for AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 He left ICN in 1992 to become prime minister of Yugoslavia, saying he hoped to 
bring an end to that country's civil war. He left Yugoslavia nine months later 
after a no-confidence vote and returned to the company. ICN Set to Grow 
</P>
<P>
 ICN Pharmaceuticals has announced a plan to merge with three of its 
affiliates. The new company will retain the name ICN Pharmaceuticals. A look at 
the new company and how ICN stock has been performing during the past few 
months: 
</P>
<P>
 ICN AT A GLANCE * Founded: 1960 * Headquarters: Costa Mesa * Chairman and CEO: 
Milan Panic * Merger partners: SPI Pharmaceuticals, Viratek and Biomedical * 
Projected sales: $500 million * Board membership: 17-member board of directors; 
15 will be from outside the company * Products: Pharmaceuticals, diagnostic

MARKET BEAT / TOM PETRUNO: HOW IDB WENT FROM BUYER TO SELLER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM PETRUNO

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With its stock price cut in half and its accounting practices under fire, 
Culver City-based IDB Communications Group agreed Monday to be acquired by a 
rival. 
</P>
<P>
 But far from closing the book on its tumultuous recent history, the satellite 
communications company's decision to sell out stirred new controversy on Wall 
Street. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the firm's largest shareholders are desperately trying to affix blame 
for what they regard as the premature end to IDB's once-stellar story. 
</P>
<P>
 Some view IDB's 38-year-old founder and chairman, Jeffrey P. Sudikoff, as 
tired of the Wall Street game and anxious to move on to other pursuits -- 
mainly his majority ownership of the Los Angeles Kings. It's a charge that 
rankles Sudikoff, who insists that his decision to sell the 10-year-old firm is 
solely based on a new assessment of IDB's future in the evolving 
telecommunications industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Until a few months ago, IDB as a stand-alone entity had been one of Wall 
Street's classic growth-stock stories. The company's sales and earnings were 
rocketing, its global satellite communications network was the envy of 
competitors, and a small army of analysts pounded the table about the firm's 
dazzling long-term potential. 
</P>
<P>
 At its most basic, the saga of IDB's fast fall comes down to numbers -- and 
expectations versus reality. 
</P>
<P>
 While Sudikoff crossed the globe cementing IDB's valuable telecommunications 
contracts with foreign clients earlier this year, his No. 2 man was in a battle 
royal with the company's accounting firm of Deloitte & Touche. 
</P>
<P>
 IDB's No. 2, President Edward Cheramy, insisted that the company's rapid 
first-quarter earnings growth rate, after major acquisitions in 1992 and 1993, 
was real. But the auditors' doubts were so severe that, in a stunning decision, 
they quit in May -- fueling a collapse of IDB's stock. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday, Deloitte & Touche was vindicated at least in part: IDB, now advised by 
audit firm Arthur Andersen, agreed to restate its first-quarter earnings, 
slashing reported results by 33%. Even more significant, IDB indicated it is 
reviewing its use of a controversial accounting practice that, in effect, 
allowed the company to book long-distance revenue before it actually came in. 
</P>
<P>
 But in perhaps the biggest surprise, Sudikoff and his board agreed Monday to 
sell IDB to long-distance telecommunications firm LDDS Communications for a 
price that many of IDB's big shareholders regard as too cheap. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, IDB stock tumbled 62.5 cents to $8.875 on Tuesday, reacting to the 
merger terms: Each of IDB's 74 million shares would be exchanged for 
approximately one-half an LDDS share. 
</P>
<P>
 At LDDS' closing price of $19.44 on Tuesday, the deal is worth about $9.30 a 
share to IDB holders. Earlier this year, before the accounting dispute 
surfaced, IDB shares traded as high as $20.50. 
</P>
<P>
 Sudikoff insists that Wall Street is being short-sighted in criticizing the 
deal's terms. Noting that the marriage will take months to close, he expressed 
optimism that LDDS' stock will climb over that period -- lifting IDB shares as 
well -- as investors look closely at the combined firm's potential. "You have 
to look at where we expect LDDS to be in six months," Sudikoff said. 
</P>
<P>
 But his words so far are falling on many deaf ears. "This deal pisses me off," 
said Michael Mahoney, manager of the GT Global Telecommunications stock fund in 
San Francisco. As holder of 3.5 million IDB shares, he believes Sudikoff should 
have negotiated a higher price, given the value of IDB's extensive 
international long-distance telecom agreements with foreign countries. 
</P>
<P>
 Those agreements, or "gateways," represent a key asset that LDDS Chairman 
Bernard Ebbers needed to take his fast-growing domestic long-distance business 
to the international level. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Yet until last spring, the assumption among investors was that Sudikoff's IDB 
was as firmly in position to be a buyer of other telecom networks as Ebbers' 
LDDS. In fact, IDB's dramatic growth in recent years -- from $86 million in 
revenue in 1990 to $311 million last year -- occurred as a result of huge 
acquisitions that brought IDB a horde of new long-distance clients. 
</P>
<P>
 To grow by acquisition, however, IDB needed a high stock price. As long as its 
earnings continued to expand at a brisk pace -- 33% in 1993 -- investors were 
willing to afford IDB a lofty share value. 
</P>
<P>
 But when IDB's accountants resigned over the first-quarter earnings report, 
Wall Street had to consider its worst nightmare: that IDB's growth may have 
been inflated by its accounting practices. 
</P>
<P>
 IDB's announcement Monday that it is reconsidering a key element of its 
accounting practices has only added to Wall Street's fear that it was somehow 
duped with regard to the company's past growth. 
</P>
<P>
 Sudikoff insists that IDB engaged in nothing more than "aggressive" legal 
accounting. And he notes, correctly, that while Deloitte & Touche had problems 
with some of the company's first-quarter earnings calculations, the accountants 
had all along blessed IDB's revenue-accrual methodology. 
</P>
<P>
 The bigger question for many IDB shareholders, then, is why Sudikoff is 
suddenly selling IDB and why at no premium to the market price. 
</P>
<P>
 To hear LDDS' Ebbers describe it, the buyout price isn't low. Ebbers says IDB, 
as a stand-alone firm, would earn about 35 cents a share in 1995. A 
$9.30-a-share purchase of IDB "as a multiple of 35 cents is a very high price," 
he argues. 
</P>
<P>
 As recently as three months ago, however, IDB was content with analysts' 
estimate of 75 cents a share in earnings in 1995. Why, now, is IDB capable of 
only half that? 
</P>
<P>
 Sudikoff says the issue isn't accounting changes, but the rapidly changing 
global telecommunications business. He came to realize this year, he says, that 
"we were short of the solutions needed to build the company on a stand-alone 
basis." 
</P>
<P>
 IDB needed a bigger partner, Sudikoff said, and LDDS is a natural fit. As for 
how the market had valued -- and is valuing -- IDB stock, Sudikoff said: "I 
wasn't as smart or as clever as they (investors) thought I was when the stock 
was at $20, and I'm not as dumb or as conniving as they think I am with the 
stock down here." 
</P>
<P>
 Some investors questioned whether Sudikoff has been distracted from IDB by his 
L.A. Kings investment. Sudikoff scoffs at that. His 4.8 million IDB shares 
represent the bulk of his wealth, and thus would be extremely foolish for him 
to ignore, he says. "IDB gets all my attention." 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, he says that despite the accounting storm that was aggravated by 
personality disputes between Cheramy and Deloitte, "Ed didn't make the problem 
all by himself. IDB management fell short of the mark in realizing what had to 
be accomplished" to keep earnings on track. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Cheramy, 50, will have no role in the new IDB-LDDS. Sudikoff said Cheramy 
had previously expressed a desire to retire and has already moved to Jackson, 
Wyo. In the process, Cheramy was a heavy seller of his IDB shares in spring, 
before the accounting dispute surfaced. 
</P>
<P>
 Sudikoff, meanwhile, will have no official position at LDDS other than 
director. He will remain in L.A. While he says he would be quick to consider 
any rival bid for IDB, if none surfaces he is adamant that he negotiated the 
best possible deal. "My equity is more important to me than my job," he says. 
In deciding to sell IDB to LDDS, he says, "I'm protecting the value of my 
equity and theirs (other shareholders')." IDB's Fast Rise -- and Fall Shares of 
IDB Communications Group languished in the company's early years, until the 
firm mushroomed in size via acquisitions in 1992 and 1993. But questions about 
IDB's accounting practices cut the stock in half this year. IDB's high price 
each quarter on Nasdaq, except latest:

BREAK ZONE AHEAD; SANTA ANA ENTERPRISE AREA A SUCCESS STORY IN STATE PROGRAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON LEE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Last summer, Ernie Rodriguez was so close to relocating his plastics company 
from Santa Ana that he had already picked out a site in Corona. But by fall, 
Rodriguez had decided to stay put. 
</P>
<P>
 He credits his change of heart to Santa Ana's enterprise zone, which, through 
various tax incentives, will probably save his 50-employee company, Southern 
California Plastics, at least $25,000 this year in state business income tax -- 
and much more in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a pretty good chunk of money," said Rodriguez, an immigrant from 
Argentina who bought his business nine years ago for $150,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodriguez is one of about 90 business owners who have signed on with the 
enterprise zone, helping make the program highly successful in its first full 
year of existence. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the city received the special economic designation in June, 1993, Santa 
Ana officials say the program has helped create or save 540 jobs, has filled up 
much of the city's vacant industrial space and is expected to reduce the state 
tax burden to participating companies by at least $3.4 million -- enabling them 
to pump those dollars back into their businesses and the community. 
</P>
<P>
 State officials say those 540 jobs -- most of them in manufacturing and some 
paying annual salaries as high as $71,000 -- mark the most in a single year for 
any of the state's 34 enterprise zones. 
</P>
<P>
 "Santa Ana is one of the top performers in the program right now," said Sam 
Paredes, director of California's enterprise zone agency in Sacramento, which 
over the years has taken some heat for not being more effective. 
</P>
<P>
 The state's enterprise zone program, which started in 1986, is intended to 
give economically depressed areas a boost by offering state income tax breaks 
to businesses. Santa Ana, with Orange County's highest jobless rate -- 10.2% 
for June -- is the county's only city to be designated an enterprise zone. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Most businesses in California must pay a state income tax of 9.3%. But 
companies in enterprise zones can reduce the tax by as much as $1.3 million a 
year if they buy machinery and other equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, companies can earn as much as $19,000 for each employee over a five-year 
period by hiring certain categories of people, including those with low incomes 
or those who have lost their jobs through layoffs or plant closings. The 
program also includes incentives for lowering business expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 From 1986 to 1993, the program statewide helped create or save almost 39,000 
jobs. But some zones, especially those in economically depressed areas of Los 
Angeles County, have been criticized for failing to create much interest, let 
alone jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 "They just weren't high-priority," Jack Kyser, economist for the Economic 
Development Corp. of Los Angeles County, said of the zones. 
</P>
<P>
 State and city officials, as well as local business owners, attribute the 
early success of Santa Ana's zone partly to aggressive marketing by the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Sandi Gottlieb and Bonnie Birch, the city's two full-time officials working on 
the program, say they have mailed out tens of thousands of brochures and spent 
$30,000 in advertising. 
</P>
<P>
 The city "took the program very seriously," said Hal Duensing, who runs Long 
Beach's highly rated enterprise zone, which helped create or keep 350 jobs in 
1992, its first year of operation. 
</P>
<P>
 Another advantage was that Santa Ana started out with an ample supply of 
available industrial space. The Altadena-Pasadena enterprise zone, for example, 
has had a tough time attracting new businesses or helping existing ones expand 
because its industrial real estate is pretty well developed, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Santa Ana's zone is huge, encompassing about 6,200 acres, or 98% 
of the industrial space available for lease in the city. Most of the zone is in 
southeast and southwest Santa Ana, with the largest stretch along Main Street. 
</P>
<P>
 Just before the zone was formed, Santa Ana had about 4 million square feet of 
vacant industrial space, according to CB Commercial in Anaheim. That has since 
dropped to 2.6 million square feet, a decline brokers attribute to firms such 
as GT Bicycles, which left Santa Ana years ago but came back after the zone was 
created, and California Connection, an apparel maker that moved much of its Los 
Angeles operations to Santa Ana to take advantage of the enterprise zone. 
</P>
<P>
 For those and other companies, city officials estimate the total tax credits 
for hiring certain categories of workers to be $3.4 million in the first year. 
Those businesses are also expected to reap millions of dollars more in tax 
credits for the purchase of machinery. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Press, owner of Gold Coast Baking Co. in Santa Ana, was skeptical when he 
filled out the paperwork for the program last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the beginning, I was an agnostic," said Press, who started his business 
five years ago with one small oven and one employee. "I said, 'Yeah, right, the 
government's going to help someone grow a business.' " 
</P>
<P>
 But since then, he has moved to a bigger site in the enterprise zone, bought 
two tunnel ovens at a total cost of $450,000 and hired 50 employees -- 23 of 
them through the enterprise zone program -- for positions that include 
maintenance and production. 
</P>
<P>
 Press said that for its fiscal year ended April 30, his company paid just $800 
in state income tax -- the minimum amount. How much did he save? While 
declining to be specific, Press said that without the zone benefits, his state 
tax bill would have been in the "high five digits." 
</P>
<P>
 Gold Coast Baking now has 93 workers, and Press expects his company's revenue 
to reach $10 million in the current fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's allowed me to take those dollars and put it into new equipment," Press 
said of the enterprise zone. "I think this program goes further for the state 
of California in turning around its negative business climate image than 
anything else I've seen." Enterprise Zone Thrives 
</P>
<P>
 Businesses within the Santa Ana enterprise zone receive state tax advantages 
and other economic incentives. The year-old zone, the only one of its kind in 
Orange County, is one of the most successful in California.

MERGER WOULD CREATE DRUG INDUSTRY GIANT; PHARMACEUTICALS: AMERICAN HOME 
PRODUCTS MAKES A SURPRISE $8.5-BILLION BID FOR RIVAL AMERICAN CYANAMID. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JESUS SANCHEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a merger that would create one of the world's largest pharmaceutical firms, 
American Home Products Corp., maker of Anacin and Advil pain relievers and 
other health products, made a surprise $8.5-billion bid Tuesday for competitor 
American Cyanamid Co. 
</P>
<P>
 The $95-a-share offer -- about 50% above American Cyanamid's stock price on 
Tuesday -- is the richest in a recent wave of pharmaceutical company mergers. 
Faced with government and corporate efforts to cut health care costs, many 
large drug makers are seeking to lower operating expenses and boost marketing 
clout by combining with competitors. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody is looking for critical mass in the pharmaceutical business," said 
Jim McCamant, editor of the Medical Technology Stock Letter. 
</P>
<P>
 American Home submitted the offer as Cyanamid was reportedly talking about 
spinning off its drug and medical products business -- which generate about $3 
billion in annual sales -- to British pharmaceuticals giant SmithKline Beecham. 
In return, SmithKline would give Cyanamid its vaccine and animal health 
products, according to the Wall Street Journal. 
</P>
<P>
 Industry analysts said it was not clear whether the American Home offer would 
scare off SmithKline or other potential bidders. Officials at American Home, 
Cyanamid and SmithKline could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 American Home Products, which also sells Dristan and Robitussin cold and cough 
medicines, said its offer is based on the removal of any Cyanamid anti-takeover 
provisions and the absence of any significant asset sales. The deal must also 
be approved by shareholders and pass any federal antitrust reviews. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter Tuesday to Cyanamid Chairman Albert J. Costello, Stafford said his 
company has been watching Cyanamid closely and is "extremely impressed" with 
its management. 
</P>
<P>
 "The combination of our companies would result in an enterprise with the 
strength and breadth required to prosper in times of uncertainty for the health 
care industry," Stafford wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 Cyanamid did not immediately respond to the offer. 
</P>
<P>
 On the New York Stock Exchange Tuesday, American Home shares fell 75 cents to 
close at $56.75; Cyanamid surged $30 to $93. Word of the deal helped give a 
lift to other drug stocks as investors made bets on the next likely takeover 
target. 
</P>
<P>
 An American Home-Cyanamid deal would eclipse the $6.6 billion that drug maker 
Merck & Co. paid last year for Medco Containment Services, a large prescription 
benefits manager and mail-order drug company. 
</P>
<P>
 A merger between American Home and Cyanamid would create a giant with more 
than $6 billion in drug and medical products sales. The deal also would help 
each company overcome unique shortfalls. 
</P>
<P>
 Although American Home's over-the-counter products are well known, the firm 
badly needs to broaden and update its prescription drug lines, analysts said. 
The Madison, N.J.-based company's birth control products, which include the 
Norplant contraceptive, are faced with slow growth, and its best-selling 
prescription drug -- Premarin, an estrogen replacement -- will soon face 
competition from low-cost generics. 
</P>
<P>
 Cyanamid, which makes the Centrum brand of multivitamins, has struggled to 
reorganize its money-losing health care business. However, the company has a 
large and profitable generic drug division that American Home lacks, as well as 
a 53.5% stake in Immunex, a Seattle-based biotechnology company that has 
several drugs for cancer treatment under development. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A merged company will be able to cut costs by combining sales and research 
staffs, for example, as well as offer an expanded product line to customers. A 
large stable of products is critical if both companies are to win contracts 
from cost-conscious managed-care health providers, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The deal probably buys a fair amount of time for American Home Products to 
reap the benefits of synergies and consolidation while they wait patiently for 
long-term new products to bear fruit," said Steven B. Gerber, a pharmaceutical 
industry analyst at Oppenheimer & Co. 
</P>
<P>
 American Home and Cyanamid also generate substantial revenues outside of the 
health care industry. American Home's food lines include Chef Boyardee and 
Jiffy Pop, and Cyanamid also sells agricultural insecticides and animal feed.

 Delta Pilots to Forgo 2% Pay Hike: The pilots union said it hopes the carrier 
will use the proceeds to add three flights and rehire 36 pilots.The Air Line 
Pilots Assn., which represents 9,000 Delta Air Lines pilots, told the 
cash-strapped carrier it will meet a pay freeze request. The raise would have 
cost Delta $26 million a year. The Atlanta-based airline said the action was 
"promising" and that it will consider the union's proposal.

 Rolls to Stop Building Convertibles: The British auto maker said it will 
finish production with 24 special-edition, turbo-charged Corniche S ragtops 
over the next four months.The firm has struggled in recent years with declining 
demand for its Rolls-Royces and Bentleys, caused partly by recession and partly 
by consumers' preference for higher-performance cars. Rolls-Royce has slimmed 
down so it can be profitable on a production of just over 1,300 cars a year. 
"We're a smaller company, and the cost of making each Corniche was increasing," 
a spokesman said. "It required an inordinate amount of work for just two or 
three cars a week." Rolls convertibles have had a long history among the 
famous.

 Sunset Strip Dowager Is Sold: The St. James's Club & Hotel, which in its 
previous incarnation as Sunset Tower was home to such celebrities as John 
Wayne, Marilyn Monroe, Frank Sinatra and Bugsy Siegel, has been sold to a real 
estate limited partnership assembled by Morgan Stanley. The price was 
undisclosed.Built in 1931, the 15-story building at 8358 Sunset Blvd. was long 
a Hollywood art deco landmark, but a failed 1980s real estate venture left it 
half-demolished and looking like "Beirut West," in the words of former resident 
Werner ("Hogan's Heroes") Klemperer. British developer Peter de Savary 
renovated the building for more than $40 million and reopened it in 1988 as the 
St. James's Club & Hotel. The building is listed on the National Register of 
Historic Places, but it's better known for stories such as John Wayne keeping a 
cow in his penthouse for fresh milk (not true, Wayne spokesmen said) and that 
Siegel, the creator of Las Vegas as a gambling mecca, was "asked" to move out 
because of his notoriety.

 PG&E Will Freeze Rates for Third Year: The San Francisco-based investor-owned 
utility will continue its rate freeze through 1995 instead of making increases 
of $285 million that would have taken effect Jan. 1.The company will also 
continue a $70-million rate reduction aimed at large industrial users. 
President and Chief Executive Stanley T. Skinner said the moves are part of the 
utility's effort to cut costs as it prepares for increased competition in the 
electric power industry. The system average rate for PG&E in 1994 is 10.6 cents 
per kilowatt hour, compared to Southern California Edison Co.'s rate of 10.5 
cents.

ICN ANNOUNCES PLAN TO MERGE WITH AFFILIATES; STREAMLINING: NEW FIRM WOULD KEEP 
ICN PHARMACEUTICALS NAME AND HAVE $500 MILLION IN SALES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 ICN Pharmaceuticals in Costa Mesa said Thursday that it plans to streamline 
its operations by merging with its three affiliates, creating a new company 
with $500 million in annual sales. 
</P>
<P>
 If shareholders and federal regulators approve the proposal, the new company, 
which will keep the name ICN Pharmaceuticals, would begin trading on the New 
York Stock Exchange this fall. 
</P>
<P>
 "Truly, this will increase value for all our shareholders," said Milan Panic, 
chairman of ICN, who would head the consolidated company as chairman, president 
and chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal would merge ICN with SPI Pharmaceuticals, Viratek and ICN 
Biomedicals. ICN is now part owner of the other three companies. All four are 
based in Costa Mesa and are publicly traded. Panic is chairman of all four. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts and shareholders applauded the proposal as a positive move for ICN, 
which vowed earlier this year, after winning a bitter proxy battle against 
dissident stockholder Rafi M. Kahn, to be more attentive to investors' 
concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's an outstanding program. Given the uneven management this company 
has shown, I'm surprised they've come up with something as intelligent as 
this," said Seth Glickenhaus, partner with Glickenhaus & Co. of New York, an 
investment fund and ICN investor. "It focuses their attention in one direction 
instead of four, reduces debt costs and has substantial tax savings." 
</P>
<P>
 Even Kahn praised the plan. "I view this as a very positive development for 
shareholders of all the ICN family of stocks," said Kahn, a former Beverly 
Hills stockbroker who launched his crusade for control of ICN last year, 
blaming Panic for wasting corporate funds on luxuries and paying himself 
millions of dollars a year while the company performed poorly. 
</P>
<P>
 The merger is intended to save money by streamlining management to eliminate 
duplication, reducing accounting and auditing fees and lowering income taxes. 
It would also reduce debt. ICN officials said Tuesday that much of the four 
companies' long-term debt would be refinanced at lower interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the merger plan, which has not yet been filed with the Securities and 
Exchange Commission, ICN and Viratek stockholders would receive one share of 
the new company for about two of their current shares. SPI stockholders would 
receive one new share for each old share, and ICN Biomedicals' investors would 
get one new share for five existing shares. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Panic has been a controversial, high-profile figure. In 1991, he agreed to pay 
$600,000 to settle a civil complaint from the Food and Drug Administration, 
which said he improperly promoted the company's drug Virazole to treat AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 He left ICN in 1992 to become prime minister of Yugoslavia, saying he hoped to 
bring an end to that country's civil war. He left nine months later after a 
no-confidence vote and returned to the company. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts and brokers said they are encouraged that ICN's management had 
started considering its investors. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the first time in my memory where management, after going through a 
brutal proxy battle . . . listened to what shareholders were saying and 
implemented plans and programs," said Dave Harvey, a broker with Princor 
Financial Services Corp. in Odessa, Tex.

FINANCE FIRM MAKES 2ND BID TO BUY UNITRIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a move to strengthen its life insurance and consumer finance businesses, 
American General Corp. said Tuesday that it has offered to buy Unitrin Inc., a 
Chicago-based insurer, for $2.6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 It is the second time American General has offered to buy the company for that 
amount in recent weeks. Its first attempt, made July 12, was rejected July 26 
by Unitrin's board, Houston-based American General said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
 The first offer was $50.375 a share, or $2.6 billion in cash, for Unitrin's 
51.8 million outstanding shares, American General said. 
</P>
<P>
 American General has been expanding its life insurance and consumer finance 
businesses through acquisitions and by selling off property and casualty lines 
over the last several years, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
 Unitrin, which is more than one-third American General's size in terms of 
revenue, would be among the largest purchases the company has made. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be a significant acquisition for American General," said Frederick 
T. Sandburg, an analyst at Kemper Securities Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 Unitrin, a holding company with 7,500 employees, offers life and health 
insurance and consumer loans through subsidiaries primarily in the Midwest and 
West. It also has a casualty and property insurance business. 
</P>
<P>
 American General said its latest offer represents a 30% premium over the value 
of Unitrin common stock as of July 11 and more than 100% over the current 
market value of the company's operating businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 As such, the offer is fair and higher than the highest price at which Unitrin 
shares have ever traded, the American General statement said. 
</P>
<P>
 The company indicated that it would consider a higher price should Unitrin 
demonstrate "additional value" during merger negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 Harold S. Hook, American General chairman and chief executive, said the 
combined company would serve more than 8 million households and have assets of 
$50 billion and revenue of $6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 American General officials were not available for further comment; Unitrin 
officials were not available. 
</P>
<P>
 The offer expires Sept. 12 and is subject to a merger agreement between it and 
Unitrin, American General said. The acquisition would add to earnings per share 
two years after the deal closes, the company added. 
</P>
<P>
 The American General statement was issued after financial markets closed. 
American General shares closed at $28.25, down 75 cents on the New York Stock 
Exchange. Unitrin stock closed at $39.75, down $1.50 on Nasdaq.  
</P>
<P>
 Unitrin has assets of $4.8 billion.

U.S. SHIPBUILDING INDUSTRY GETS $1-BILLION BOOST; AID: LOANS ARE INTENDED TO 
HELP FIRMS COMPETE GLOBALLY. SAN DIEGO'S NASSCO TO GET $22.7 MILLION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Fulfilling a campaign promise during a 1992 visit to the West Coast's only 
remaining private shipyard, President Clinton on Tuesday announced $1 billion 
worth of federally guaranteed loans designed to revitalize the shrunken U.S. 
shipbuilding industry. 
</P>
<P>
 The loans, aimed at helping domestic shipbuilders compete internationally and 
wean themselves from military contracts, include $22.7 million for National 
Steel & Shipbuilding Co. of San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 The San Diego shipyard has 3,500 people working on a $2.5-billion backlog of 
Navy projects, and the loans will not lead immediately to more jobs, general 
counsel Sam Timmons said. But he said the money will pay for the equipment 
needed to make Nassco competitive with Japanese and Korean builders in bidding 
for commercial jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the loan money will go to shipyards in Louisiana and Virginia that 
expect to sign contracts to build ships for foreign customers. No U.S. shipyard 
has exported a commercial vessel since the mid-1950s. 
</P>
<P>
 McDermott Shipyard in Louisiana is in line to receive $726 million in loans to 
build 30 container ships for Saracen Group of Geneva, Switzerland. Newport News 
(Va.) Shipbuilding would get a $133-million loan agreement to build four oil 
tankers for Fleves Shipping of Piraeus, Greece. 
</P>
<P>
 Those deals require approval from the Transportation Department's Maritime 
Administration, which is expected. Approved along with the San Diego project is 
a $132-million contract to Coastal Ship Inc. of Houston for two U.S.-flag 
barges. 
</P>
<P>
 The loan program was made possible by an act of Congress and nearly $100 
million in federal appropriations last November. Tuesday's announcement 
identified the first beneficiaries. 
</P>
<P>
 The loans will come from private banks but will carry federal guarantees that 
lower the cost to the borrowers by 10%. The government guarantees are similar 
to those routinely available to foreign shipyards and will create a more even 
playing field for U.S. shipbuilders, said John Stocker of the Shipbuilders 
Council of America, a trade group based in Arlington, Va. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. shipyards once received government subsidies, but those were discontinued 
in the early 1980s under the Reagan Administration. That and defense cutbacks 
have caused a decline in U.S. shipbuilding jobs to 100,000 currently from 
180,000 in 1979. Over that period, the number of U.S. shipyards building 
complete vessels has dwindled to 15 from 95, Stocker said. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of foreign yards' competitive advantage, U.S. yards have all but 
conceded the international shipbuilding market to foreign firms over the the 
past few decades.

MEXICO ACCUSES U.S. OF 'DUMPING' STEEL; TRADE: OFFICIALS CLAIM UNFAIR PRICING 
AS THEY SLAP TARIFFS ON SHEET PLATE AND GALVANIZED LAMINATE STEEL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 America's steel industry, one of the most aggressive complainers about foreign 
steel "dumping" in the United States, found itself on the receiving end of the 
same accusation Tuesday in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mexican Commerce Department slapped tariffs on two types of U.S. steel 
imports, arguing that the step was needed to prevent the United States from 
selling its products at unfairly low prices in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. steelmakers accused of the actions did not immediately respond. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mexican action comes at a time when the U.S.-Mexico economic relationship 
is expanding, partly as a result of the North American Free Trade Agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 Steel tariffs are to be phased out over the next decade under NAFTA, the pact 
designed to make North America a single market in which most goods and services 
can flow freely across borders. 
</P>
<P>
 Dumping is selling a product in a foreign market at a price lower than the 
price charged at home to shed excess stock. It is a prevalent accusation in 
international trade disputes. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexico's commerce department said Bethlehem Steel, USX, Geneva and Lukens were 
hit with tariffs for sheet plate steel. 
</P>
<P>
 The government also imposed tariffs for galvanized laminate steel that would 
affect USX, Mitsui, New Process and World Metals. 
</P>
<P>
 The accused "have shown that they were exporting to Mexico at dumping prices 
that have or threaten to damage the national industry," the Mexican statement 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Under NAFTA, tariffs on steel will be phased out by 2004, along with any on 
textiles, cotton, lumber and cosmetics. Duties on goods such as glassware, 
orange juice, sugar and peanuts are to be phased out within 15 years.DUMPING

DRAMATIC NATIONWIDE DROP-OFF REPORTED IN SALES OF NEW HOMES; ECONOMY: SOUTHLAND 
RESALE MARKET APPEARS TO BUCK THAT TREND AS SOME AGENTS NOTE BRISK RATE OF 
TRANSACTIONS.

<P>
 Sales of new homes plummeted in June to the lowest level in two years, the 
Commerce Department said Tuesday, as rising interest rates sapped business 
across the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Sales dropped 14.1% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 591,000 units -- 
the lowest since 584,000 in June, 1992 -- after a revised 2.2% rise in May and 
a 6.8% fall in April. 
</P>
<P>
 Surprisingly, the biggest drop in home sales came not in the West but in the 
South and Northeast, said Steve Berman, a survey statistician in the 
department's Bureau of the Census. 
</P>
<P>
 In the West, which includes both the Coastal and Rocky Mountain states, new 
home sales were down 10.7% to a rate of 175,000, the lowest in a year. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the Northeast, sales dropped 18.6% to a rate of 48,000, and in the 
South they fell 19.1% to a rate of 254,000 -- in each case the lowest level of 
sales since August, 1992, department officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The West Coast had been lagging the rest of the country in terms of a housing 
recovery, especially California and Southern California," said Michael 
Carliner, an economist with the National Assn. of Home Builders, a trade group 
in Washington. "The Mountain states had been doing reasonably well, based 
mainly on people leaving California." 
</P>
<P>
 A one-month drop is not enough to establish a trend, and Southern California 
real estate brokers Tuesday said they had mixed experiences in the overall 
housing market, including resales. 
</P>
<P>
 In Beverly Hills, Prudential real estate broker Anita Harris said sales of 
expensive homes had been nonexistent for several weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the western San Fernando Valley, "we had an excellent month in June and 
in July," said Bobbi Miller, manager of the Woodland Hills office of Fred Sands 
Realtors. "Sales are up over last year, absolutely." 
</P>
<P>
 In June, Miller's office sold 80 homes, about the same as the month before. 
"We don't think the housing market is slowing," Miller said. "It's very brisk." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Previously, the department said May sales nationally had risen 4.2% to a 
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 738,000. But it revised that sales rate 
sharply downward. 
</P>
<P>
 The June sales plunge was the steepest since January, when they fell 21.4% to 
a rate of 642,000. Sales were also down 7.8% from levels of a year ago, in 
June, 1993, when they were at a rate of 641,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, the National Realtors Assn. said sales of existing or used homes 
also slipped in June -- though less dramatically -- down 3.6% to a seasonally 
adjusted annual rate of 3.96 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Industry analysts say rising interest rates are putting a damper on 
construction and sales of homes and that a modest second-half downturn is 
likely. 
</P>
<P>
 Long-term mortgage rates bottomed out last October at 6.74% and have risen 
sharply since then. The Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. said average rates for 
a 30-year mortgage loan rose slightly to 8.57% last week from 8.52% a week 
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 The Federal Reserve Board has raised short-term interest rates four times this 
year, aiming to moderate the pace of economic activity, and interest-sensitive 
sectors such as housing show the impact in weakening sales and building rates. 
</P>
<P>
 New home sales suffered in every region of the country during June. 
</P>
<P>
 Midwest sales eased by 3.4% to a rate of 114,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The average home sales price in June of $157,200 was up from $150,700 in May. 
It was the highest since August, 1989. New Home Sales

 Senate Panel Backs GATT: A key Senate committee endorsed the global free trade 
accord but dealt a setback to the Clinton Administration's request to submit 
future trade pacts to Congress for expedited approval. The Senate Finance 
Committee vote amounts to a recommendation to the Administration, which plans 
this month to submit legislation implementing the 123-nation accord negotiated 
under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.It will be considered under 
fast-track rules that require Congress to accept or reject the treaty without 
amendment. Once adopted, the bill would provide nearly $12 billion in tax 
increases, spending cuts and bookkeeping adjustments to offset tariffs expected 
to be lost during the first five years of the GATT pact. However, the Senate 
version does not authorize the Administration to submit future trade agreements 
under fast-track rules.

 Canada Agrees to Wheat Sale Limit: The government said it will keep exports of 
the grain to the United States at 1.5 million metric tons for a year to avoid a 
trade war. Above that level, the United States would apply prohibitive tariffs 
on exports made between Monday and July 31, 1995, Agriculture Minister Ralph 
Goodale said after the Cabinet approved the deal struck Monday in Washington. 
The new amount is a substantial cut from last year, when Canada shipped a 
record 2.5 million tons of wheat to the United States, whose own crops were 
badly damaged by floods.

 2 Firms Agree to Settle Hemophiliacs' Suit: Under the proposed settlement, 
medical suppliers Baxter International Inc. of Deerfield, Ill., and 
French-owned Rhone-Poulenc Rorer Inc. of Collegeville, Pa., would pay a 
combined $140 million to $160 million into a fund for U.S. residents with 
hemophilia who became infected after they used blood-clotting products tainted 
with HIV and sold by the companies. The proposal needs court 
approval.Defendants Miles Inc., Alpha Therapeutic Corp. and the National 
Hemophilia Foundation did not participate in the settlement. The suit, filed in 
U.S. District Court in Chicago, alleges the defendants continued selling or 
promoting the products after they should have known that some of the paid 
donors of blood used to make the products were at high risk for HIV infection.

 Insurers Paid $1.52 Billion in AIDS Claims in 1993: The American Council of 
Life Insurance said that according to its 1993 survey, U.S. companies paid that 
amount in cases directly related to AIDS patients, up from the $1.41 billion 
the life and health insurers paid in 1992.Results were based on responses from 
372 companies and on projections of claims paid by companies that did not 
respond to the survey. Responding companies paid claims of slightly more than 
$1 billion, the trade group said. AIDS-related claims since 1986 total about 
$7.8 billion, the survey found.

 GAO Investigation of Nasdaq Glitches Requested: The House of Representatives 
telecommunications and finance subcommittee asked the General Accounting 
Office, Congress' investigative body, to look into the circumstances 
surrounding the technical problems that have disrupted the Nasdaq trading 
system several times in the past 2 1/2 weeks and find out what can be done to 
prevent their occurring again.The panel oversees U.S. securities markets. 
Nasdaq trades the stocks of about 4,800 companies. A spokesman for Nasdaq, 
which is operated by the National Assn. of Securities Dealers, a 
self-regulatory organization, said, "We will be working with them to get their 
job done" and that Nasdaq has been conducting its own review of the matter.

FINANCIAL MARKETS; MEXICAN STOCKS HIT 4-MONTH HIGH ON EXPECTATIONS OF MORE 
GROWTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Wire Services 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Pushing aside a year of inflation, civil unrest and political uncertainty, 
Mexican stocks rallied Tuesday to four-month highs amid expectations that the 
nation's ruling party will remain in power and economic growth will increase 
after this month's presidential elections. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bolsa index jumped 64.98, or 2.63%, to close at 2538.52, its highest level 
since reaching 2,543.57 on March 23.  
</P>
<P>
 Mexican stocks haven't exactly been glamour pusses lately. For most of this 
year, volume and excitement have been in short supply. The Bolsa index at first 
sputtered, then dropped dramatically as guerrillas fought army troops in the 
southeastern state of Chiapas. The index fell again when presidential candidate 
Luis Donaldo Colosio was assassinated March 23. 
</P>
<P>
 As world confidence in the country's ability to pull itself together waned, 
the Bolsa hit a low of 1,957.33 on April 20. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the past two weeks, however, signs of solid economic growth and good 
corporate earnings reports have sparked a lively rally. Early last month, 
Mexico's stock market was down about 15% in U.S. dollar terms since Jan. 1. Now 
the index is down 10.38% in dollar terms and just 2.47% in local currency terms 
for the year. 
</P>
<P>
 The recent spike got its start July 20, after a Louis Harris poll reported 
that 50% of the electorate preferred Ernesto Zedillo, the presidential 
candidate of the PRI, or Institutional Revolutionary Party. A PRI victory in 
the Aug. 21 election would ensure continued economic reforms and growth in 
corporate profits, analysts and traders said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody thinks: 'Zedillo will win. There will be 5% economic growth in 
1995. The peso will not be devalued. There will be no social instability. So 
let's buy,' " said Herman Von Bertrab, director of research at InverWorld in 
San Antonio. 
</P>
<P>
 But Von Bertrab said the rise in Mexico stocks "is overdone. The fundamentals 
in Mexico have not changed." He said his firm is selling stocks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Zedillo will win. That's almost certain," Von Bertrab said, but higher 
interest rates in the United States could easily put a damper on the Mexican 
market. 
</P>
<P>
 Share prices were pushed higher in part because yields on dollar-indexed 
government bonds fell an average of 20 basis points in this week's auction of 
government debt, Von Bertrab said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lower rates reduce the cost of borrowing, which can help boost company 
profits, making stocks more valuable. Rates began to decline last week as 
investors expressed confidence that the free-market economic policies of 
President Carlos Salinas de Gortari will remain in effect until 2000. 
</P>
<P>
 "My premise was that Mexico wasn't going to see good growth until interest 
rates go down," said Kelly McDermott, a global fund portfolio manager at 
Dreyfus Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether an economic recovery can be sustained will depend on whether the 
victor in the presidential elections can keep interest rates down, McDermott 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Salomon Bros. said in a recent research report that the Bolsa index could rise 
above 3,000 by the end of the year if there is 2.7% economic growth and a 
further drop in interest rates from the current 17.5%. 
</P>
<P>
 Carlos Fritsch, head of Latin American research at S.G. Warburg, is predicting 
an increase to 2,900 by year's end. 
</P>
<P>
 Some analysts anticipated the Tuesday's rally. "Mexico currently trades at 12 
times estimated 1995 earnings and is one of the world's cheapest markets," 
Morgan Stanley's Robert J. Pelosky Jr. wrote in a July 14 research report. "I 
don't think it will stay that way much longer." 
</P>
<P>
 Mexican stocks first got a boost last month when the government reported 
unexpectedly healthy growth in second-quarter gross domestic product. 
</P>
<P>
 Then several large Mexican companies reported solid earnings growth, Telefonos 
de Mexico and Grupo Carso, an industrial conglomerate, among them. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, American depositary receipts of Telefonos de Mexico, worth 26% of 
the Bolsa index and a benchmark for the Mexican market, advanced 2% to $62.625, 
their highest price since June 7.

SOUTHWEST AIRLINES TO TEST TICKETLESS TRAVEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Southwest Airlines Co. said Tuesday that it will test a system in which 
passengers won't need to hold tickets to fly. 
</P>
<P>
 Starting Aug. 22, Southwest will test ticketless travel among four cities: 
Dallas; Houston; Corpus Christi, Tex., and Little Rock, Ark. If the system is 
adopted on all its routes, Southwest would be the first major airline to 
abandon the traditional ticketing process. 
</P>
<P>
 Southwest spokesman Ed Stewart compared the new system to ones used by car 
rental agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 "You show up at the ticket counter and you have a confirmation number, and we 
give you a boarding pass and off you go," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts have speculated for months that Dallas-based Southwest would develop 
a ticketless system by the end of the year. If successful, the new system will 
make it easier for travel agents to book reservations on Southwest. 
</P>
<P>
 Southwest has been tinkering with a new ticketing system since it was bumped 
off three computerized reservations systems used by travel agents, starting in 
May, because it refused to pay booking fees. Southwest said the flap hasn't 
hurt its revenue but that it has taken the opportunity to look at new ways of 
selling seats. 
</P>
<P>
 Southwest did not release details on how the system will work. 
</P>
<P>
 The test will be offered mainly to Southwest's frequent fliers and some 
corporate travelers. Travel agencies in the test markets will also be invited 
to participate. 
</P>
<P>
 Southwest said it will decide whether to carry out a systemwide test in 
September based on the results. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are very excited because this test is consistent with Southwest's 
reputation for being an innovator and trendsetter in the travel industry," 
Southwest Chairman Herbert Kelleher said in a statement. "Furthermore, (it) 
gives us the opportunity to reduce any perceived dependency on the computer 
reservations systems owned by our competitors." 
</P>
<P>
 Those systems are System One, owned by Continental Airlines, and Apollo, owned 
primarily by United Airlines and USAir. When the systems stopped letting travel 
agents print out tickets for Southwest flights, some agents had to resort to 
writing tickets by hand. Worldspan, another reservations system, also changed 
its listing method so it was less convenient for travel agents to see 
information about Southwest flights and fares. 
</P>
<P>
 Southwest pays to be listed by the largest computerized reservations system, 
American Airlines' Sabre.

FCC AIMS TO CURB 800-NUMBER ABUSES; CONSUMERS: REGULATORS UNVEIL A PLAN TO STOP 
UNWARRANTED BILLING FOR MOSTLY ADULT SERVICES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Federal regulators took the first step Tuesday toward preventing consumers 
from being wrongly billed for calls to information services. 
</P>
<P>
 The Federal Communications Commission unveiled a plan to stem the abuses after 
receiving 2,000 complaints in the first six months of this year involving such 
charges, mostly for adult-oriented services carried on 800 numbers, said 
Richard Metzger, deputy chief of the FCC's Common Carrier Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem involves only a small portion of the information services industry 
-- companies that use 800 numbers not only to deliver services, from sports 
scores to psychic readings, but also charge for the call. 
</P>
<P>
 The vast majority of information services use 900 numbers. Virtually all 800 
numbers are toll-free -- unless the company, taking advantage of an exception 
in a 1992 law, somehow got the caller's permission for the charge. 
</P>
<P>
 That's where the problem has cropped up, regulators said. In many instances, 
the caller, who may have agreed to the charge, wasn't the one who received the 
bill. Rather, the home or establishment from where the call was made got stuck 
with the charges because the local telephone company simply sent the bill 
there. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal is one of those rare regulatory instances in which some local 
phone companies, prompted by customer complaints, want tougher federal rules. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're getting a lot of complaints from our customers," said Alan Ciamporcero, 
executive director of federal relations for Pacific Telesis Group. "It is very 
hard for us to separate legitimate ones (agreements between callers and 
information service companies) from not-legitimate ones." 
</P>
<P>
 Under the FCC's new plan, local phone companies have to make sure they are 
billing the caller. They must verify that a written contract has been entered 
between the caller and the information service company before they bill for 
800-number calls. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan would also require the local phone company to break out charges for 
these calls from long-distance charges. It would also have to list the name, 
address and number of the information service provider; the type of service 
offered, and the date, time and duration of the call. 
</P>
<P>
 Plagued by customer complaints over 800-number charges, Bell Atlantic Corp. in 
June stopped billing for these calls, spokesman Michel Daley said. 
</P>
<P>
 Metzger said many of the FCC's complaints are from hotels, colleges and 
universities and parents -- all of whom were billed for calls they didn't make. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents were particularly frustrated. Unlike 900 numbers, 800 numbers cannot 
be blocked by the head of a household. So there is no safety net for parents 
whose child might surreptitiously make an 800-number call. 
</P>
<P>
 FCC attorney Robert Spangler said people usually end up paying for the calls 
out of fear of losing their telephone service, a ploy some information service 
companies use to get people to pay, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's amazing to look at the number of complaints where a person says, 'I 
agreed to pay this because I don't want to lose my phone service,' " he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The FCC's plan is open to comment by industry groups and could be modified 
further. The ultimate plan is subject to another commission vote before 
becoming final. 
</P>
<P>
 Regulators said the plan, if adopted, will mean more work for local telephone 
companies, which are responsible for handling billing from information service 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
 One practice that appears to be on the rise could thwart any verification 
process, Daley said. Some information service calls are showing up as a regular 
10-digit long-distance number, rather than an 800 number through which the 
service is actually provided. Local phone companies can't tell that those 
charges need to be verified.

COMPUTER FILE / LAWRENCE J. MAGID: THE CUTTING EDGE: COMPUTING / TECHNOLOGY / 
INNOVATION; CYBERSPACE AIDS IN OUTREACH TO VICTIMS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE, 
ABUSIVE RELATIONSHIPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

writer.

<P>
 The O.J. Simpson case has raised awareness about domestic violence in all 
parts of society, including cyberspace. Thanks to the interactive nature of 
on-line services and the Internet, victims of domestic violence can now reach 
out, get support from others and, in some cases, take effective action. 
</P>
<P>
 The most comprehensive support system I've seen to date is on the Prodigy 
service, where Christy, among other people, posted a note asking for advice on 
how to get out of an abusive relationship. Frances responded by recalling her 
own struggles with an abusive husband. A third person, Bonnie Cunningham, gave 
some specific advice on how the two women could break away from their 
destructive relationships and "explore the deeper issues" that keep them bound 
to abusive men. Christy wrote back, "Bonnie, you are a godsend!! I can't tell 
you how much you have helped me. . . . Thanks to your support I'm not going to 
see him again. I don't want to die." 
</P>
<P>
 These women have never met or spoken with each other, but they're part of an 
impromptu nationwide on-line support group that "meets" on a continuing basis. 
</P>
<P>
 Cunningham, a former battered women's shelter coordinator, is spending more 
than her usual amount of time on Prodigy as she recovers from injuries suffered 
during the Northridge earthquake. Abuse victims who read her offers of help on 
the public bulletin board usually contact her by private electronic mail to 
avoid discussing their problems in public. Prodigy displays a member's real 
name on all public bulletin board notes. So far, at least six of the women 
Cunningham's helped have left their abusive partners. "Three of them are now in 
shelters," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some abuse victims find on-line services to be less intimidating than calling 
a hot line or visiting a shelter, Cunningham said. "Besides, it's a lot easier 
for a victim to quietly pour her heart out into the computer while her husband 
watches TV on the couch than it is to sneak over to a neighbor's house to make 
a private phone call." 
</P>
<P>
 Prodigy's domestic violence topic is located on its Home Life Bulletin Board. 
As with other Prodigy bulletin boards, members can post questions or comments, 
respond to what others write or simply read what others have posted. Prodigy 
charges $3.60 an hour to access its bulletin boards. 
</P>
<P>
 America Online, CompuServe and GEnie also offer discussion groups on domestic 
violence, but so far they're not as comprehensive or as easy to find as 
Prodigy's. American Online members can find solace in the Better Health & 
Medical Forum, where they can participate in live "Abuse Survivors" conferences 
each Wednesday evening, or an ongoing bulletin board discussion in the 
"Abuse/Incest Support" folder. Discussions about "violence against women" take 
place in AOL's Women's Board. 
</P>
<P>
 Discussions about domestic violence on CompuServe can be found in the 
Survivors/Recovery and Safety/Protection sections of the Time Warner Crime 
Forum and in the Women's Forum. GEnie users can find such discussions in the 
Survival and Recovery section of the Personal Growth RoundTable. This is a 
"private" area, which means you have to request admission from the system 
operator. 
</P>
<P>
 The Women's Wire, an on-line service focused on women, offers access to the 
staff of the Domestic Abuse Awareness Project. Subscribers can display articles 
and participate in forums with groups working to combat domestic violence. For 
more information, call (800) 210-9999 or (415) 615-8989. 
</P>
<P>
 Finding help on the Internet can be tough, given the vast number of resources 
on this global network of networks. Most Internet providers offer access to 
forums, called newsgroups, where people can post and read messages from other 
Internet users. One newsgroup called alt.support.abuse-recovery specializes in 
helping people deal with various forms of abuse, including domestic violence, 
drug and alcohol addiction and other problems. Another option is the 
alt.abuse.recovery newsgroup. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who need to deal with their own abusive behavior can try the 
alt.abuse.offender.recovery newsgroup. You'll find additional discussions and 
shoulders to lean on in soc.women, soc.feminism and soc.men. 
</P>
<P>
 Going on line to find support for a personal problem can be a good choice for 
some people, according to Stuart Schwartz, a professor of clinical psychiatry 
at Robert Wood Johnson Medical School in New Brunswick, N.J.  
</P>
<P>
 "The computer provides a sense of anonymity and distance while retaining a 
sense of immediacy," he said. "But it's not for everyone. It is by no means a 
substitute for a face-to-face personal intervention." 
</P>
<P>
 Debbie Lee, associate director of the San Francisco-based Family Violence 
Prevention Fund, agrees that for some people, using an on-line service is "not 
threatening because there is no person confronting what you are thinking." She 
also appreciates its educational value for others, including people who may not 
be personally involved in an abusive relationship. "People are just beginning 
to realize that domestic violence is everyone's business," she said.

IN DEVELOPMENT: THE CUTTING EDGE: COMPUTING / TECHNOLOGY / INNOVATION; CHAOS 
ALLOWS DATA TO BE HEARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 To many people, the sounds of chaos might mean the music of a heavy metal 
group. But scientists at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign have 
given the mathematical theory of chaos some music of its own. Researchers at 
the National Center for Supercomputing Applications have created a computer 
interface that not only allows users to see chaotic interactions, but to hear 
them as well. 
</P>
<P>
 The interface presents a digital representation of a ball that can be moved 
across a textured plane. Changing the peaks and valleys on the plane or moving 
the ball to a different area of the plane produces different sounds. The 
interface can produce sounds using almost any numerical data. With the 
interface, chaos becomes a musical instrument -- just as musicians use the 
keyboard to explore the sounds of the piano. 
</P>
<P>
 Scientists are excited about this sonification of data because it gives them 
another way other than visually to interpret complex data. What if storm 
patterns were not only visible on a screen, but also became louder as winds 
increased? 
</P>
<P>
 Musical composers are also intrigued: Insook Choi, a UIUC research assistant, 
has composed a musical piece using the sounds of chaos. Her composition, 
"anti-Odysseus, the irreversibility of time," premiered at Expo 93 in Taejon 
and Seoul, Korea. 
</P>
<P>
 Switching Off Mercury: Steam irons that turn off automatically and the lights 
that turn on when you open the trunk of your automobile have one thing in 
common: a mercury-based switch. Mercury switches turn up in thousands of modern 
conveniences, from computer screens to thermostats to street lights. Because 
mercury flows, it is used in switches that work based on the position of the 
objects. The problem is, once in the environment, mercury changes into toxic 
compounds. California, Florida and Minnesota have already banned new products 
containing mercury, and New Jersey prohibits the disposal of such products. 
</P>
<P>
 Coming up with an alternative to mercury wasn't easy, as scientists at 
Virginia Tech found when a Virginia businessman asked them to develop a 
non-mercuric switch. The substance would have to work with AC power and 
preferably DC as well. It had to be non-hazardous to the environment and had to 
work in subfreezing temperatures. 
</P>
<P>
 The answer came in the form of a gallium-based alloy that is actually more 
conductive than mercury, meaning switches can be made smaller and still carry 
electricity. The initial U.S. patent on the NonMerc switch will be issued this 
fall. The technology has been licensed to NonMerc, a new company in Manassas, 
Va., created to commercialize the switch. 
</P>
<P>
 From Feast to Famine: Legumes such as cowpeas, black-eyed peas, chickpeas and 
mung beans are important sources of protein in developing nations in Africa, 
Asia and South America. Unfortunately, their seeds are also an important food 
source for insect larvae, particularly weevils that can virtually wipe out a 
seed granary in a few months. The quest for pest-resistant seeds is fueled in 
part by a lack of insecticides in much of the Western world. About five years 
ago, a team of researchers led by a biologist at University of California, San 
Diego, began looking for a way to genetically engineer insect-resistant seeds 
for these important legumes. The researchers discovered that certain weevils 
could be stunted when fed a diet that inhibited amylase, a protein needed to 
digest starch. 
</P>
<P>
 The gene responsible for an amylase inhibitor protein was found in the common 
kidney bean. By transferring that gene from the kidney bean into a legume 
species, seeds were produced that are indigestible to weevils and thus starve 
the larvae. Maarten Chrispeels, the biologist who led the team, believes this 
is the first time seeds themselves have been made resistant to the insects. 
</P>
<P>
 Pinwheels for the Mind: A videotape of concentric circles somewhat akin to a 
child's pinwheel is helping researchers at Stanford University push imaging of 
the human brain to a resolution almost 50 times greater than previously 
accomplished. By tracking blood flow, magnetic resonance imaging machines have 
allowed researchers to see brain activity on the level of millions of neurons. 
But previous attempts to see it on the level of a few hundred thousand or fewer 
have been frustrated by surges of blood flowing through vessels to reach 
specific neurons. 
</P>
<P>
 To prevent such surges, researchers designed a videotape of concentric circles 
of white alternating with a checkerboard pattern that moves in and out across 
the field of vision in a regular pattern. The neurons responsible for 
monitoring different locations in the field respond only when the flickering 
checkerboard passes into the range they monitor. 
</P>
<P>
 Because only half the visual field is stimulated at a given time, the blood 
flow to the area is roughly constant. The work has the potential to aid in 
diagnosis and treatment of temporary or permanent damage from strokes or 
accidents, as well as developmental problems. KATHLEEN WIEGNER

 Five Bay Area women will embark next week on an ordinary summer journey in an 
extraordinary fashion: They'll be driving a 1984 Chevy diesel van across the 
country, but instead of diesel fuel, they'll be filling their tank with used 
french fry oil from fast-food joints. 
</P>
<P>
 If they succeed, Nicole Cousino, Sarah Lewison, Florence Dore, Julie Konop and 
Gina Todus -- who will make a documentary film of the trip -- will be the first 
to complete a lard-powered cross-country voyage. 
</P>
<P>
 The technology involved has been around in part since the late 1800s, when 
Rudolph Diesel invented the diesel engine. Even then, his engine could run on 
vegetable oil, but it was hard to burn and tended to clog fuel lines. These 
problems have been solved by a process called transesterification. 
</P>
<P>
 To chemists, esterifying plant oils is fairly simple: Mix in the right amount 
of alcohol along with a catalyst, and the basic molecules of the oil -- known 
as triglycerides -- are turned into hydrocarbons that resemble normal diesel. 
</P>
<P>
 The touring filmmakers will carry out their experiment with the help of 
donations from environmental advocate Greenpeace and a Burger King franchisee. 
Though they don't have advanced chemistry degrees, they do have a reliable 
recipe for whipping up biodiesel on the road: 80 parts french fry oil (which 
must be poured through a filter to remove the bits of fries), 19 parts methanol 
(wood alcohol) and one part Drano (sodium hydroxide, the catalyst). 
</P>
<P>
 The ingredients are mixed together, impurities at the top are skimmed off, and 
the whole batch is washed with water. The resulting light-yellow esters are 
supposed to run a diesel engine as well as any fuel you buy at the pump. And 
with the oil free, it's cost-competitive. 
</P>
<P>
 Biodiesel pleases both Midwestern grain farmers and environmentalists. It 
produces no sulfur dioxide -- which causes acid rain -- and releases no more 
carbon dioxide than its source crops consume, so there's no net addition of 
greenhouse gases to the atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, the van's exhaust will smell like doughnuts. But it won't have a black 
exhaust plume like vehicles running on conventional diesel. And it will help 
burn up the grease Americans discard yearly: some 2.4 billion pounds, according 
to Render, a trade magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 The women leave New York on Tuesday and plan to arrive in San Francisco Aug. 
26. Along the way, dressed in orange neon waitress outfits, they'll videotape 
demonstrations of the technology as well as interviews about sustainable energy 
and alternative fuels.

Q & A: THE CUTTING EDGE: COMPUTING / TECHNOLOGY / INNOVATION; MASTER OF 
FIDONET'S BBS LINKUP SYSTEM CHAMPIONS FREEDOM OF ELECTRONIC MAIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES WEISSMAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If you think Fido is just an unimaginative name for a dog, you haven't been 
spending enough time in cyberspace. FidoNet is a clever way of linking local 
computer bulletin boards, the increasingly popular services that allow people 
with common interests to exchange electronic messages and access other 
information via their personal computers. 
</P>
<P>
 With FidoNet, electronic messages can hop from one small bulletin board 
service (BBS) to another. The system spans the country, allowing a message to 
pass coast-to-coast for the cost of a local telephone call. 
</P>
<P>
 FidoNet has thus harnessed the communal leanings of many BBS operators, 
establishing a kind of poor man's Internet. Today there are approximately 
34,000 FidoNet "nodes" -- bulletin boards that use Fido protocols and agree to 
relay information -- with coverage around the globe. 
</P>
<P>
 To keep up with developments, there is a FidoNet newsletter and even an 
electronic discussion group on the Internet comp.org.fidonet. This year is the 
10th anniversary of Fido, which started out as a software program for operating 
one of the original computer bulletin boards. Its creator, Tom Jennings, 
basically gave away the program as part of his philosophy of "radical 
communications." We spoke with Jennings in his office in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Tell me about the beginnings of Fido. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A: I went through 12 major revisions (of the software) and hundreds of minor 
ones. At that time, my friend Randy Bush up in Portland, Ore., documented the 
FidoNet protocols. We wanted to make them more public. A couple of people 
started to write clones. It's sort of amusing to note that two of the first 
three authors were gay troublemaker types. Sort of set a lot of the tone for 
FidoNet stuff. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How would you say that affected FidoNet? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A: I am not going to trust my neighbors for my ability to communicate. If your 
neighbors don't like you, they can shun you and you disappear. That is how gay 
people and other people who are deemed to be undesirable are basically shunned 
out of existence. 
</P>
<P>
 In FidoNet, the ability to communicate is a physical ability to communicate. 
You can't shut someone up. That's the beauty of it. It was designed that way. I 
can set up a bulletin board at my house for instance, and you cannot stop me 
from sending mail -- short of knocking my door down. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: You call yourself a "radical troublemaker." What kind of trouble do you 
make? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A: Just making sure that everyone can communicate. I had the honor, as I call 
it, of defending this quite rabid, quite idiotic fundamentalist Christian nut 
case. He was writing these really poorly written articles in the FidoNet 
newsletter. They just weren't coherent and legible -- it didn't have anything 
to do with content. 
</P>
<P>
 He was so hate-filled and so troublemaking that he was being kicked out of the 
networks and they were trying to refuse to run his stuff. As editor, we had 
these rules: If it fits various physical and legal criteria, it will run. 
Regardless of content. Regardless of how infuriating it is. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How did it feel being in that position? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A: I thought it was hilariously funny. I mean, the guy infuriated me to no 
end. But at some point he became so extreme that it was kind of hard to take 
him very seriously. Censorship is never good. I don't think any speech or any 
information should ever be suppressed for any reason whatsoever. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Does FidoNet then provide something that the other networks don't? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A: First of all, it's providing connectivity. Most of the planet simply can't 
afford direct connections to the Internet (the massive "network of networks" 
originally funded by the federal government to connect universities and 
government research laboratories). It's exceedingly complex. It's really nice 
but it ain't cheap. It takes a whole lot of infrastructure. If you do stuff 
that's unpopular, you'll find that your hosts don't really want to carry you. * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Do you think FidoNet has engendered more open communication? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A: There's still a great hump to get over: the ability to spend $1,000 or 
whatever on a computer and a modem and a phone line and to be able to buy your 
own time to use it. Just 1% of the planet has (such resources). 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: So you're saying that access to technology is the issue? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A: The only thing that always bothers me about media coverage (of technology 
and communications) in general is that it says, "One day we'll all have this, 
and it's all great," and it is great to various degrees. But the access issue 
is really a big deal. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a big party spoiler. You drag it out and people go, "Oh, well that's no 
fun to talk about." Because it's not any fun to talk about. It's expensive. 
It's also wrapped around this really normal white culture thing that's 
oppressive in its very nature to a lot of people. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How do you mean it's wrapped around that? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A: I mean right down to every paradigm in e-mail ever done: Messages look like 
interoffice memos, files in file cabinets on desktops. What level do you want 
to start at? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Do you view technology as neutral? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A: No. I wouldn't call it neutral -- neutral is not the right word. Neutral 
implies it's benign. It's like a knife: It has two edges. Its position changes 
where you're looking, how you're looking, who you are, what side of the knife 
you're on. 
</P>
<P>
 It's got good aspects. Some things, like telephones, you could say are a good 
thing. Hopefully networking will end up being so. Whatever form it actually 
takes, it certainly won't be e-mail in front of a screen and a keyboard. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What's the best thing about networking for you? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A: It's a big intellectual thrill of this giant bunch of machinery doing 
basically indeterminate things. It's cool that Cambridge, England, is 15 
milliseconds away. It has become a giant machine that covers the planet. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What's the future of FidoNet? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A: I have no idea. Things come and go; I doubt it'll have a cataclysmic 
ending. It'll probably just mutate into something else. Biobox

MERGER SPECULATION SENDS TWO MORTGAGE STOCKS SKYWARD; TRADING: PLAZA HOME 
MORTGAGE SHARES RISE 19%, WHILE IMPERIAL CREDIT INDUSTRIES' SHOOT UP 23.5%. 
BOTH ARE BASED IN SANTA ANA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Shares of two Orange County mortgage brokerages soared Tuesday on speculation 
that mortgage companies increasingly are becoming the focus of mergers and 
acquisitions. 
</P>
<P>
 Plaza Home Mortgage Corp.'s stock rose 19% to close at $7.125 in heavy Nasdaq 
trading, while shares of Imperial Credit Industries Inc., also traded on the 
Nasdaq market, jumped 23.5% to $10.50. Both companies are based in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the second time this year that shares of Plaza and other publicly 
traded mortgage companies have been boosted by merger speculation as interest 
rates rise and home sales level off. The activity began on May 12 when Chemical 
Banking Corp. agreed to acquire Margaretten Financial Corp. in a $330-million 
transaction. Chemical paid $25 a share for the New Jersey operator of 89 
mortgage offices. 
</P>
<P>
 Two weeks later, on May 26, Plaza's stock jumped 23% to $8.129 a share, a 
one-day gain of $1.56. Two months after that, on July 29, Plaza released a 
dismal second-quarter financial report showing a first-half loss of $9.8 
million, or 85 cents a share, contrasted with a profit of $3.3 million, or 30 
cents a share, for the same period a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 The company attributed the loss to the substantial industrywide decrease in 
mortgage refinance activity, "intense" pricing pressure in the origination 
markets and hedging losses. 
</P>
<P>
 A Plaza Home spokeswoman said the company doesn't comment on its stock 
activity. 
</P>
<P>
 Shares of Plaza, which went public in October, 1992, have traded as high as 
$8.50 this year and hit their historic high of $10.50 in March, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, investors traded 186,500 shares of Plaza common stock, almost 
three times the recent daily average volume. About 68,000 shares of Imperial 
changed hands, a 51% increase over average daily volume. 
</P>
<P>
 Imperial, which also went public in 1992, traded at a high of $19.525 in 
March, 1993. The shares were as high as $13.50 this year before the price began 
sagging as mortgage interest rates rose. 
</P>
<P>
 Imperial reported a profit of $1.2 million, or 11 cents a share, for the first 
half of 1994, down from earnings of $6.9 million, or 67 cents a share, for the 
same period a year earlier.

 Fidelity National Financial Inc.: The Irvine title insurance underwriter 
posted a second-quarter profit of $4.2 million, or 26 cents a share.That was 
down from earnings of $9.5 million, or 63 cents a share, for the same period in 
1993. Revenue fell 12% to $130.3 million from $147.3 million. The company 
attributed the reduced profit and revenue to the decline in home refinancing 
activity and a sluggish residential resale market, both caused by higher 
mortgage interest rates. Year-to-date profit dropped 20% to $11 million, or 69 
cents a share, from $13.8 million, or 94 cents a share, for the first six 
months last year.

 Lending Frenzy: More money was borrowed to buy California property last 
quarter than during any three-month period in the past four years, a real 
estate information service reports. 
</P>
<P>
 Lending institutions made $18 billion in purchase loans from April through 
June.That was up 34.7% from $13.4 billion in loans made during the first three 
months this year and up 23.8% from last year's second-quarter total of $14.6 
billion, according to Dataquick Information Systems in La Jolla. 
</P>
<P>
 Buyers are flocking to adjustable-rate mortgages in record numbers, Dataquick 
said. In June, for example, 64.3% of purchase loans were ARMs, compared to only 
46% for June, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot of scrambling going on in the lending industry these days. 
Lending institutions are all fine-tuning their product lines for the purchase 
market now that the refinance wave has receded," said Donald L. Cohn, chief 
executive officer of Dataquick. 
</P>
<P>
 While purchase loans increased, the amount of refinances was down 51.1% to 
$15.6 billion compared to the previous three months, when that total came to 
$32 billion. For the second quarter last year, refinances totaled $44.5 billion

2 CUSTOMERS AT NEW YORK TACO BELL TAKE $1,940 -- TO GO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHELE SALCEDO, NEWSDAY 
</P>

<P>
 Two Taco Bell customers at the store in Shirley, N.Y., didn't get the order 
they paid $3 for at the drive-up window, but they didn't complain. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of the seven-layer chicken burrito and two Meximelts inside the bag 
handed to them, they found the day's receipts for the store -- $1,940 in cash. 
</P>
<P>
 The man and woman have not been seen since they drove out of the parking lot 
of the Long Island restaurant that day three months ago. Investigators want 
them for grand larceny. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who looks in a Taco Bell bag?" asked Detective Lt. Dennis Caine, commander of 
the Fifth Squad. "The night manager was putting together the receipts for a 
night deposit. She went over to the counter, pulled a bag and put the bank bag 
inside. The girl working the window grabbed the bag, thinking it was an order, 
and handed it to the people outside." 
</P>
<P>
 Janice Smith, a spokeswoman at Taco Bell headquarters in Irvine, said the 
company has specific procedures that employees follow for gathering the cash 
receipts and making bank deposits, but she declined say whether the assistant 
manager, Lorraine Schwenker, was following those procedures May 1, when the bag 
was given to the customers. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith said neither Schwenker nor the worker, whose name police did not release 
because of her age, was fired or asked to resign. She declined to say if either 
was still working at the Shirley store. 
</P>
<P>
 The employee working the drive-up window told police the store was busy that 
night. "I turned and saw a bag that was sitting on the counter," she said. "I 
believed that it was the order and handed it out. The bag was light. It was a 
small order, so I didn't think anything of it." 
</P>
<P>
 Schwenker, 21, told police she pulled the receipts from the cash register 
together, placed them in a sealed bag, and put it and a deposit slip into a 
paper Taco Bell bag. 
</P>
<P>
 "I placed the paper bag on the middle shelf of the takeout counter," Schwenker 
told police. "I turned my back to get a drink for the ride to the bank. When I 
turned around, the bag was gone. I had only turned my back for the amount of 
time it took to fill a small soft-drink cup." 
</P>
<P>
 Schwenker told police she asked the employee working the take-out window if 
she had given the bag out the window. 
</P>
<P>
 "She started to cry and looked like she was panicking," Schwenker told police. 
" . . . I questioned her, saying, 'Didn't (you) look in the bag? You didn't put 
any napkins in the bag?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Schwenker said she ran out after the car, described as a large sedan, possibly 
a Cadillac, dark blue, made in the mid-1980s, but it was nowhere to be found. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said it is a crime not to return property that is given mistakenly.

3 WOUNDED IN SHOOTOUT AT CHATSWORTH NIGHTCLUB; CRIME: AN OFF-DUTY RESERVE 
OFFICER IS INJURED IN ROBBERY ATTEMPT BY TWO TEEN-AGERS, POLICE SAY. THE PAIR 
ARE ALSO HURT. 
</P>

<P>
 An off-duty reserve police officer shot two teen-agers and was himself wounded 
in a gun battle outside a Chatsworth nightclub Monday night after the 
ski-masked youths demanded his wallet, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Wilson, 34, a reserve officer for four years with the San Fernando Police 
Department, left the Cowboy Palace Saloon on Devonshire Street about 11:30 p.m. 
with a female friend when the teen-agers -- one of them brandishing a handgun 
-- approached them in the parking lot, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson drew a .38-caliber pistol he carries off duty and a gunfight broke out, 
in which he shot a 16-year-old Sun Valley boy and Mjomo Abdul Anderson, 19, of 
North Hollywood, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson, who police believe was shot by the 16-year-old, was in serious 
condition Tuesday at West Valley Hospital in Canoga Park after undergoing 
surgery for a wound in the upper leg, a hospital spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Both his assailants were shot "more than once each," in the arm, leg and 
chest, said Lt. Al Moen, of the LAPD's Robbery-Homicide Division. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sun Valley youth was in serious but stable condition at Northridge 
Hospital Medical Center and Anderson was being held at the USC-County Hospital 
Jail Ward, police said. Both were booked on suspicion of attempted murder and 
attempted robbery, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of a sudden we heard this rapid gunfire," said Dennis Groff, who was in 
the Cowboy Palace when the shooting began. "I came out the back door and a 
woman and a man with blood came running over saying, 'Call 911!' " Groff 
recounted when he returned to the bar Tuesday morning to retrieve his pool 
cues. 
</P>
<P>
 "You could tell they were young," said Groff, who said he ran over to help the 
wounded teen-agers as they lay in the parking lot. "They were definitely 
crying. I said to them, 'You're wounded, but you'll live.' "  
</P>
<P>
 No charges will be filed against Wilson, who has been working full time as a 
San Fernando policeman recently, replacing a regular officer who is on 
vacation. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't appear that anything illegal was done on his part," Moen said. "He 
basically was defending himself. He was authorized to carry and to use a 
weapon." 
</P>
<P>
 Philip Boutakidis, owner of Taste of Scandinavia, a restaurant next to the 
Cowboy Palace, said he was surprised to learn of the shooting Tuesday morning. 
Since establishing his eatery next to the nightclub 15 years ago, no one has 
ever been shot there, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "But this is Los Angeles," he said. "Things like this happen all over."

PARTY PALACE; CITY SUES OWNERS, TENANTS OVER FREQUENT REVELRIES AT HILLTOP 
MANSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANN W. O'NEILL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 To Jerry Bolduc, the mansion he and his friends rent in the hills above Studio 
City is his castle -- one primo party palace with a hot tub, five bedrooms, 
wall-to-wall king-size mattresses and a sand-filled volleyball pit by the pool. 
</P>
<P>
 To neighbors and the city attorney's office, however, it is a public nuisance 
-- where up to 1,000 people at a time paid admission to join in revels-for-hire 
that on at least one occasion were televised on MTV. 
</P>
<P>
 And so, it soon could be last call at the big house on Wrightwood Drive. The 
city attorney's office filed suit Tuesday in Los Angeles Superior Court against 
the estate's owners and tenants, seeking an injunction that would say, in 
proper legal terms: "the party's over." 
</P>
<P>
 But Bolduc, who prefers to be called "Jerry Bo," says he's going to fight for 
his right to party. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically, we spend a lot of money here to lease a big house so we can have 
parties," Bolduc said in a poolside interview, a portable phone at his side and 
sweeping view of the San Fernando Valley as his backdrop. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anybody who buys this kind of house is going to want to entertain," he added. 
"I'm not a rock star. Things could be a whole lot worse." 
</P>
<P>
 The city attorney's suit alleges, however, that not all the parties were 
private affairs. At times, court documents say, the estate was used illegally 
for commercial purposes -- so-called "underground" parties, advertised in 
flyers, at which revelers were charged $15 at the door, and liquor was sold 
without a license. 
</P>
<P>
 If the city prevails in court, property owner Paul Campbell, property manager 
Steven Powers and tenants Bolduc and Michael Dupre could all be fined or jailed 
or both. 
</P>
<P>
 For the past four years, City Attorney James Hahn alleged, the $2.1-million 
blufftop mansion has been Party Central. Up to 1,000 people at a time flocked 
to these bashes and they weren't the most well-behaved group, the lawsuit 
alleges. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors have lodged more than 100 complaints to police about "property 
damage, thefts, drug sales, sex acts occurring in public, excessive noise and 
severe traffic and parking congestion," Deputy City Attorney Deborah Sanchez 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was once a peaceful neighborhood," Sanchez said. "There had to be an end 
because these tenants really crossed the line." 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors contend that their potted plants have been pilfered, their driveways 
blocked, and that passionate party-goers indulged themselves poolside, in plain 
view. Party trash has been left in the driveway, only to become infested with 
maggots, Sanchez added. 
</P>
<P>
 And then there's the noise, the complaint alleges -- music and screaming at 
all hours of the night. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have had party-goers urinate in our bushes . . . and light up marijuana 
joints in our driveway," neighbors Margot and Cliff Lachman said in a court 
declaration. "We have observed the sale of drugs directly in front of our 
home," said Richard and Patti Kimball. 
</P>
<P>
 Court records indicate the mansion in the 3200 block of Wrightwood Drive is 
the most complained-about residence in the Los Angeles Police Department's 
North Hollywood Division. In court documents, the LAPD's Sgt. Charles Wampler 
called it "an ongoing and habitual police problem." 
</P>
<P>
 On May 6, the suit says, undercover police officers attended a party at the 
house and bought drinks at three bars, issuing seven citations to the 
bartenders for selling alcohol without a license. Flyers for that event 
advertised it as the "Age of Aquarius & Classic Disco Party," encouraging 
guests to wear tie-dye shirts, bell-bottom pants, platform shoes and other 
outfits typical of the 1960s and '70s. The city's suit alleges that the 
underground parties at the mansion violate liquor laws and building and safety 
codes, and sometimes lead to violence, city attorney spokesman Mike Qualls 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Qualls added that Tuesday's suit was the first abatement case he'd seen filed 
against a private residence for such underground parties, which are usually 
held in commercial buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 Bolduc said Tuesday that the allegations had been "trumped up" by overzealous 
police officers and spiteful neighbors. He said since he moved in eight months 
ago, he's been made to pay for the sins of past tenants. 
</P>
<P>
 The house already was notorious when "gangsta" rapper Dr. Dre hosted a 
birthday bash there early this year that was carried on MTV, he said. Bolduc 
says party-pooper police towed about 100 cars that night. 
</P>
<P>
 He says his friends have been harassed by police. Once, he said, officers 
climbed up the bluff and hid in the bushes, frightening a guest who let out a 
blood-curdling shriek at the sight of armed men by the pool. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem isn't me," he said. "I'm just a working guy trying to get ahead 
and enjoy the summer in a nice place." 
</P>
<P>
 And so what, he asks, if the city attorney doesn't approve of some of his 
party themes, such as "Lingerie Night," at which young women were admitted free 
if they wore lingerie. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's against the law about having a lingerie party?" he asked. "I've been 
going to pajama parties since I was 8 years old. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll admit to living a bachelor lifestyle," Bolduc said as he gave a tour of 
the 7,500-square-foot house. There was barely a stick of furniture downstairs: 
A couple of couches, draped with blankets. A pool table. Here and there, an 
empty beer can or a cheap art print. 
</P>
<P>
 He headed up the sweeping staircase and toward the master bedroom. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the jungle, the lair of Jerry Bo," he said, proudly showing off a 
huge boudoir, complete with a spa tub that offers a view of from Universal 
Studios all the way to the Griffith Observatory. A lone goldfish inhabited the 
aquarium. Magazines featuring photos of unclothed women were strewn on one of 
the four king-size mattresses lined up against one wall. The beds, draped in 
the same camouflage parachute material that balloons from the ceiling, are 
surrounded by army-green beanbag chairs. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's 35 feet long, including the bean bags," Bolduc said.  
</P>
<P>
 "I'll admit to having sex here," he added. "I'm guilty of that. But we 
emphatically deny that we have broken any laws here."

YAROSLAVSKY BACKS INTERIM APPOINTEE FOR COUNCIL; POLITICS: HE IS CONCERNED THAT 
HIS DISTRICT WILL NOT BE ADEQUATELY REPRESENTED WHEN HE LEAVES IN DECEMBER TO 
JOIN SUPERVISORS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN SCHWADA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Worried that his constituency would be without a leader, departing Los Angeles 
City Council member Zev Yaroslavsky said this week that an interim lawmaker 
should be appointed when he steps down in December. 
</P>
<P>
 Yaroslavsky said he fears that a leaderless period -- which could last as long 
as seven months -- would hurt critical efforts to put earthquake-battered 
Sherman Oaks back on its feet. "That's the risk," the 5th District councilman 
said during an interview this week with reporters and editors at The Times. 
</P>
<P>
 Yaroslavsky has been receptive to the idea of establishing a redevelopment 
project in Sherman Oaks to finance the rebuilding effort, a move that would be 
enormously complicated and prone to failure without strong council leadership. 
</P>
<P>
 So as an antidote, he said the City Council should adopt the novel approach of 
appointing an interim lawmaker after Yaroslavsky takes up his new duties as a 
member of the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors. The 45-year-old career 
legislator was elected to the board in June. 
</P>
<P>
 "The 5th District would undoubtedly be better protected during this interim 
period if it had a council member who had a vote," he said. "That would be the 
best of all possible worlds." 
</P>
<P>
 Such an appointee -- who Yaroslavsky said must have no long-term political 
ambitions -- could advance and protect 5th District interests and possibly 
deter other council members from stripping the district of resources. 
</P>
<P>
 Yaroslavsky leaves city office Dec. 5 after serving 19 years. 
</P>
<P>
 After that, district residents would be without representation until mid-1995, 
the earliest date when a successor could be elected to Yaroslavsky's seat. His 
four-year term ends June 30, 1997. 
</P>
<P>
 Yaroslavsky said former state Sen. Alan Sieroty and retiring Supervisor Ed 
Edelman are the kind of elder statesmen who ought to be appointed, although 
city law bars Yaroslavsky from picking his successor. 
</P>
<P>
 Experienced representatives such as Edelman and Sieroty would be well-equipped 
to guarantee that 5th District residents got their fair share from City Hall, 
which Yaroslavsky described as a "crab barrel" of competing interests. 
</P>
<P>
 Edelman said Tuesday that he was flattered by Yaroslavsky's suggestion. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I'm looking at other plans in retirement," he said. "I'm not looking 
forward to going back to the City Council." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Edelman served on the council from 1965 to 1974. Yaroslavsky was elected to 
the City Council to fill the seat Edelman vacated when he joined the Board of 
Supervisors in 1974. It is now also Edelman's seat on the board that 
Yaroslavsky is taking. 
</P>
<P>
 Yaroslavsky acknowledged that it would be difficult for the City Council to 
find and agree upon a politically disinterested but City Hall-savvy appointee. 
</P>
<P>
 But if the council does not pick an appointee, Yaroslavsky said, he would use 
his own powerful post as a county supervisor to assist district residents. 
"I'll be just up the street," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Unless the City Council breaks with its past, it is not very likely that 
members will honor Yaroslavsky's wishes. 
</P>
<P>
 In the last three decades, vacant City Council seats have been filled by 
election, not by appointment, although the City Charter gives the council the 
authority to do either. 
</P>
<P>
 The last council appointment was made in 1966. Since then, 10 council 
vacancies have been filled by election. 
</P>
<P>
 Until an election is held, council districts without a representative are run 
by the city's chief legislative analyst, an appointed office. But the analyst 
has no vote in council matters. And since the analyst is a City Council 
appointee, it could be difficult to maintain strong representation for the 
affected district if there is conflict among council members. 
</P>
<P>
 Yaroslavsky said he has not raised the idea of an appointee with council 
colleagues, but some say they have already heard about it. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Joel Wachs, one of the council's most veteran members whose 
district once included Sherman Oaks, said he did not like the idea. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 City Councilwoman Laura Chick, who represents the western San Fernando Valley, 
said she was "sympathetic" to Yaroslavsky's concern. "His absence will leave a 
void for the people in Sherman Oaks," she said. "I'm certainly open to having a 
dialogue about his idea." 
</P>
<P>
 Yaroslavsky denied that he wanted his wife, Barbara, to be appointed to the 
position. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's not what I have in mind at all," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbara Yaroslavsky has previously acknowledged that she is exploring the 
possibility of running for election to her husband's seat. Yaroslavsky told The 
Times staff this week that his wife would be a "very formidable candidate" if 
she enters the race and a "great council person" if elected.

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: BURBANK; BUSINESSES SUING TO BLOCK RAZING OF 
BUILDINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A handful of small-business owners still reeling from earthquake damage are 
suing their landlord to stop him from razing their establishments in Burbank's 
old Magnolia Park district. 
</P>
<P>
 The landlord, Jack Robertson, plans to demolish a block-long business strip at 
the southwest corner of Magnolia Boulevard and Hollywood Way, but it is not 
clear to his tenants what he will do with the vacant property. 
</P>
<P>
 The merchants are expected to sue Robertson this month, claiming he breached 
contract after he failed to ask them to leave within 30 days following the 
powerful Northridge temblor. 
</P>
<P>
 One store owner, Julius Caesar Lambrechts, contends that he first heard the 
news in May. Lambrechts said he was forced to move to a new location across the 
street after he had already invested $4,700 to replace the glass at his floor 
and carpet store. 
</P>
<P>
 "After four months, he dropped the bomb," Lambrechts said of Robertson. "He 
said, 'It would cost more than 50% of the value of the building to fix it, so I 
don't have to fix it.' " 
</P>
<P>
 "This landlord has wanted to tear this building down for a long time," said 
Odette Ashley, an attorney representing four store and office owners who are 
seeking unspecified compensation. "He's collected insurance proceeds that he 
doesn't want to apply to the building. . . . My clients all put money back into 
that property." 
</P>
<P>
 Robertson and his attorney, Alan Kheel, declined to discuss the case. But, 
Kheel said, "We dispute their contentions." 
</P>
<P>
 Signs of earthquake damage at the business strip still remain: scaffolding, 
boarded-up windows, deserted storefronts and yellow tags posted by doors that 
read "Habitable, Repairs Necessary." 
</P>
<P>
 The Magnolia Park district, which contains many buildings constructed during 
the 1940s, sustained the heaviest earthquake damage in Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
 Efforts to revitalize Magnolia Park are just beginning. A recent survey of 212 
area residents indicates that many would like to see nicer-looking stores, a 
greater variety of stores and restaurants and a higher quality of goods. 
</P>
<P>
 A recently completed study on Magnolia Park will be presented to the public 
Wednesday evening at the Burbank Central Library. VIVIEN LOU CHEN

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: GRANADA HILLS; GRISLY IMAGES TROUBLE GUESTS FROM RWANDA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN BYRNES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The only remaining connection Cyprien Munyandamutsa has to his native Rwanda 
are the grisly images of disease and death that flash nightly across the 
television screen at his daughter's house in Granada Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 The countryside where Munyandamutsa, 70, and his wife, Esther Nyiramandwa, 64, 
lived in the south of Rwanda is deserted, and more than 200 relatives including 
their parents, brothers, sisters, aunts, uncles, cousins and an 18-year-old 
adopted son are dead. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple had been in Utah and California for a year and a half when the 
bloodshed began in April, visiting their seven children who had left Rwanda at 
different times for the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Now they have no choice but to watch the horrors unfold, and wait. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is very hard," Munyandamutsa said. "But if I was there, I could not do 
anything except die with the others." 
</P>
<P>
 They would like to return to the southern Rwandan countryside where they grew 
vegetables and fruit and raised sheep, cows and chickens, Munyandamutsa said. 
He would like to continue his work as a preacher in the nearby village of 
Kibuye. But most of the Rwandans not killed in the massacres sparked by the 
downing of Rwandan President Juvenal Habyarimana's plane on April 6, fled to 
Zaire where many are still dying of cholera and dysentery. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is not easy," Munyandamutsa said. "We are old. We don't know how long we 
will have to stay." 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, Munyandamutsa and Nyiramandwa, who are Tutsi and have been 
married for 45 years, are living with their daughter and her husband in Granada 
Hills. Seven of their nine children moved to the United States to study over 
the last couple of decades, but this was the parents' first visit. 
</P>
<P>
 Munyandamutsa began taking English classes at the Rinaldi Adult Center in 
Granada Hills shortly after he arrived in the Valley in December, 1992. 
Administrators at Rinaldi found out he was Rwandan and asked what they could 
do. 
</P>
<P>
 "I said maybe they could help the many children orphaned by the war," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The school is starting a collection drive this week, asking students to give 
what they can to the Adventist Development and Relief Agency International 
(ADRA), an agency Munyandamutsa chose, which has operated in Rwanda since 1979. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe there are a lot of people who really want to help out," said Tamara 
Boehmke, a spokeswoman for ADRA. "I told them I would make sure that whatever 
they donate will help in Rwanda." 
</P>
<P>
 Munyandamutsa said he believes the aid will help. But he said it is difficult 
to think of the future with the losses still so close to his heart. "I am very 
sad for my country," he said. To send contributions for the Rwanda relief 
effort, call ADRA at (800) 424-2372. SUSAN BYRNES

STREET BEAT: THE FIGHT AGAINST CRIME: NOTES FROM THE FRONT; CONTENTIOUS 
PROCEEDINGS ARE A REAL TRIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN ABRAHAMSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ah, the noble barrister. 
</P>
<P>
 Hewing to the ancient traditions of the profession, this advocate may be found 
diligently pursuing the lofty truths that forge the law while jousting with 
exaggerated courtesy against a learned opponent. 
</P>
<P>
 Too bad that noble barrister stuff has faded into history, limited to "Rumpole 
of the Bailey" or black-and-white movies on late-night TV, to judge by a case 
winding to conclusion this Thursday in Van Nuys Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
 During an otherwise routine burglary trial, the prosecutor urged the defense 
attorney to take a tranquilizer. The defense lawyer responded that the 
prosecutor ought to take diet pills. The judge told them to behave and all 
seemed calm for a few days. 
</P>
<P>
 Then the defense lawyer called the prosecutor "a (bad word) low-life piece of 
(another bad word)."  
</P>
<P>
 Court was not in session and no jurors heard the comment, but it was promptly 
reported to Judge Kathryne Ann Stoltz, who ordered the defense lawyer, Encino 
attorney Alex R. Kessel, to explain at a hearing Thursday why he should not be 
held in contempt of court. 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecutor, Renee F. Urman, 39, an eight-year veteran of the district 
attorney's office, said she has never heard anything like it. Two years before, 
she said, a defense attorney had called her "the equivalent of a female dog. 
But that was nothing like this." 
</P>
<P>
 Kessel, 37, a former deputy DA who has been in private practice for five 
years, insists he did nothing wrong, and indeed would repeat the remark. For a 
contempt charge to stick, the law requires insolence toward the judge, the 
direct violation of a court order or "boisterous conduct" that disrupts a court 
session. 
</P>
<P>
 What he did was none of the above, but simply an exercise of his free speech 
rights under the Constitution, he said, expressing his opinion of Urman's 
tactics prosecuting Josh Coburn, a 20-year-old Arleta man on trial for felony 
burglary who eventually was convicted on a lesser charge. 
</P>
<P>
 Early in the trial, Stoltz told Kessel not to "become so emotional in his 
arguments to the court," according to a court file. 
</P>
<P>
 That afternoon, Urman reported to the judge that she had said to the defense 
lawyer outside court: "Mr. Kessel, I think you need a Valium at this time," 
according to the trial transcript. 
</P>
<P>
 Kessel, walking with Coburn's father, commented in her hearing, "Well, she 
needs (very bad word) diet pills," the prosecutor told the judge. 
</P>
<P>
 "All right," Urman complained to the judge. "I understand that perhaps I'm 
overweight. I don't care for the word (repeating very bad word) diet pills." 
</P>
<P>
 The judge "strongly admonished" both lawyers not to make personal remarks. 
</P>
<P>
 But, Urman told the judge, she later overheard Kessel saying to Coburn's 
father, "Oh, she has no personal life." That, Urman said, was "derogatory." 
</P>
<P>
 The Valium remark, the judge said, was "inappropriate." The diet pill retort 
was "a low blow." And to say that Urman had no personal life was "appalling and 
unforgivable." 
</P>
<P>
 Then came July 25, and the "low-life" remark. Although no jurors heard it, the 
court reporter, court clerk and the bailiff did. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, boy," court reporter Anna Papa said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am thoroughly disgusted with the conduct of both of you," Stoltz told the 
attorneys, according to the transcript. 
</P>
<P>
 It "may have been extremely tacky" for the prosecution to go after a defense 
witness for traffic warrants, Stoltz said. But Kessel's "low-life" comment, she 
said, was "sufficiently aggravated to rise to the level of contempt." 
</P>
<P>
 "I apologize to your court reporter and staff for using those words in front 
of them," Kessel told the judge. "But I meant every word of it, Your Honor." 
</P>
<P>
 "I would say it again," he said in an interview.  
</P>
<P>
 What's galling, Urman said in an interview, is that Stoltz gave Kessel "an 
opportunity to apologize. But he said he meant every word. It's not like it 
used to be. You'd go in there, do your best, shake hands and leave the 
courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's now getting very personal."

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: WOODLAND HILLS; FITNESS FACILITIES URGED FOR COLLEGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KURT PITZER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The northeast corner of Pierce College should be turned into a fitness mecca, 
complete with a jogging/exercise course, weight rooms, an Olympic-sized 
swimming pool and facilities for golf, softball and other sports, according to 
college President Mary Lee. 
</P>
<P>
 With funds from a privately operated golf driving range -- approved in concept 
last month by the Los Angeles Community College District Board of Trustees -- 
the area of campus near Winnetka Avenue and Victory Boulevard could attract 
hundreds of sports-minded students and residents.  
</P>
<P>
 "The college will have a combination of facilities that exists nowhere else in 
the West Valley," Lee said. "It will also give the college a higher profile and 
better image in the community." 
</P>
<P>
 Since taking the job in April, the former Valley College president has been 
under pressure to find innovative ways to fund classes and pay for improvements 
to aging campus facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 The golf driving range, which has been proposed in various forms for several 
years, could bring in up to $300,000 a year to the school, Lee said. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposals from driving range developers are expected to be considered during 
the next few months, after which plans would be submitted to the district for 
final approval. The lease probably would span between 10 and 20 years, Lee 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposals might include the installation of lights, so patrons could practice 
teeing off at night. 
</P>
<P>
 That could tee off some neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there's going to be lighting at night, it can't be shining into the 
windows of residential communities to the north and the east," said Woodland 
Hills Homeowners Organization President Robert Gross. "But we'll wait and see 
how they plan to mitigate." 
</P>
<P>
 Lee said the developer would probably be asked to pay for several changes to 
the area, such as moving the soccer and baseball fields, before building a 
driving range. 
</P>
<P>
 Some funds from the venture could be used for projects such as creating a 
jogging path with stations for chin-ups and other exercises, building a room 
for weight training and exercise machines adjacent to one of the gyms and 
expanding the swimming pool from 25 meters to 50 meters. 
</P>
<P>
 Each project would be considered separately by the trustees. KURT PITZER

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: ENCINO; RESIDENTS PROTEST TRANSMISSION TOWER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC SLATER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For the second time in less than a month, AirTouch Cellular has found itself 
battling Valley residents over the installation of a transmission tower. 
</P>
<P>
 This time the ruckus is in Encino, where one neighborhood is balking at an 
antenna system the communications company has proposed for the top of a Ventura 
Boulevard office building. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can send people to the moon, but we can't find another location," said 
Gary Davis, who lives near the building at 17547 Ventura Blvd. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis said he filed an appeal on Tuesday, seeking to have the Los Angeles 
Board of Zoning Appeals rescind its recent approval of the project. 
</P>
<P>
 AirTouch spokeswoman Melissa May said the company had met numerous 
requirements in planning the system and made several changes to satisfy 
planning officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's as kosher as kosher can be," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The outcry in Encino sounds very much like one that emanated from a Northridge 
neighborhood last month, eventually prompting AirTouch to cancel plans for a 
75-foot tower in a residential area. Both antenna projects have been aimed at 
increasing cellular telephone coverage and capacity in the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 The system in Encino, however, would consist primarily of panel antennas about 
four feet in diameter and resting on stands. Even on top of the three-story 
building, they would not stand as tall as the project proposed in Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 May said the antennas would also be shrouded with screens to make them more 
aesthetically pleasing. 
</P>
<P>
 Led by Davis, at least 15 neighbors have signed a petition decrying the 
transmission facility, citing the unknown effects of electromagnetic energy and 
the equipment being an eyesore. 
</P>
<P>
 And while it does not exceed city planning and zoning height restrictions, 
Davis said, it does violate those of the Ventura-Cahuenga Boulevard Specific 
Plan, which limit a building's highest point to 30 feet. 
</P>
<P>
 "The specific plan supersedes the old plans," he said. "And it's ignored all 
the time." 
</P>
<P>
 With Davis appealing the project, it will likely be several months before a 
final decision is made. ERIC SLATER

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: CITY OKS NEW, FASTER ANTI-GRAFFITI PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF SCHNAUFER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles City Council on Tuesday approved a $500,000 pilot project for 
a faster, more aesthetic anti-graffiti program that will target areas of the 
San Fernando Valley and Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The project, named "Zero Tolerance," will use quick-mix paint machines mounted 
on trucks and employ professional graffiti cleaners instead of community 
service work crews to swiftly eradicate graffiti. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'Zero Tolerance' means two things," said Delphia Jones, director of the 
city's Operation Clean Sweep program. "First, we can remove it within 24 hours 
and, second, it will look like it was never there." 
</P>
<P>
 Slated to begin in October, the six-month project will focus on areas that are 
victimized by graffiti in low-, moderate- and high-frequency doses. For the 
pilot project, there is one geographic area for each category. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Valley, a part of Mission Hills has been identified as a low-frequency 
area for the pilot project, Jones said. This area encompasses Rinaldi Street to 
the north, Lassen Street to the south, the San Diego Freeway to the west and 
the Golden State Freeway to the east. 
</P>
<P>
 Portions of Reseda and Northridge have been selected as the moderate-frequency 
area for the project. The area includes Parthenia Street to the north, Sherman 
Way to the south, Wilbur Avenue to the west and Lindley Avenue to the east. 
</P>
<P>
 The high-frequency graffiti zone is in the Los Angeles basin, with the 
Hollywood Freeway to the north, Olympic Boulevard to the south, Figueroa Street 
to the east and Alvarado Street to the west. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones would not disclose the number of graffiti incidents used as criteria to 
categorize such areas. However, she said that each area is currently visited 
daily by her cleanup crews. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike previous efforts, where cleanup crews can take up to three days to 
respond to a graffiti complaint, the "Zero Tolerance" program will not utilize 
work crews on community service. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Jones said each zone will operate a "Pro Paint" truck manned by a 
professional graffiti cleaner. Each truck uses a computer to mix the paint to 
match the vandalized surface. 
</P>
<P>
 "No more patch-quilt look," Jones explained. 
</P>
<P>
 Public and private buildings, from freeway on-ramps to businesses, will be 
targeted during the program, which will kick off at daybreak. Residents will be 
given a toll-free number to report graffiti complaints and work crews will 
cruise their area in a crisscross pattern to spot problem sites. 
</P>
<P>
 If successful, Jones said her department will examine whether to expand the 
program to other areas of the city. JEFF SCHNAUFER

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SAN FERNANDO; CITY MOVES ON NEW EMERGENCY CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF SCHNAUFER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the first step toward building a new firing range and emergency 
communications center, the San Fernando City Council has asked its city 
attorney to investigate the legality of pre-qualifying bidders for the project. 
</P>
<P>
 The new, $260,000 facility is designed to replace the antiquated emergency 
center and firing range at the old police station on MacNeil Street. 
</P>
<P>
 Police were unable to use the radios at the emergency center immediately after 
the Northridge earthquake because there is no emergency power available in the 
old facility. The new facility will have a separate power generator. 
</P>
<P>
 "The idea of the emergency communications center is that we're able to go to a 
group of people at the center and they have shortwave radios and they are able 
to get a message to the outside world," said Lt. Rico Castro of the San 
Fernando Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday's City Council action directs City Attorney Julia Silva to determine 
whether the city can pre-qualify bidders before opening the bidding process, 
said city Finance Director Mike Moon. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's trying to get the bid list down to people who know how to do the 
project," Moon said. 
</P>
<P>
 The state will fund about $190,000 for the new facility, which would be built 
adjoining the new police station at 910 1st St. The remaining funds will be 
paid for by the city, Moon said. JEFF SCHNAUFER

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SAN FERNANDO; HEARING SCHEDULED ON LIBRARY FUNDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The San Fernando City Council has scheduled two public hearings and one 
election to deal with three important issues: library funding, a hospital deal 
and leasing the old San Fernando police station. 
</P>
<P>
 The first hearing, on the library issue, will be held at 6 p.m. Aug. 15 at the 
council chambers, 117 MacNeil St. in San Fernando. 
</P>
<P>
 The council is expected to decide whether to approve Los Angeles County's 
proposal to create a special library district under the Mello-Roos Community 
Facilities Act. 
</P>
<P>
 The district, which would be funded by a flat tax on property owners, would 
preserve and boost services at the county's 88 public libraries, including the 
San Fernando branch at 1050 Library St. The County Board of Supervisors is 
expected to consider the matter Aug. 30. 
</P>
<P>
 According to San Fernando library manager Judith Babka, the county budget 
crisis has slashed hours at her facility by 50% during the past two years, 
including reducing the budget for new materials from $48,500 in 1992 to $500 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the City Council does not participate in the new district," Babka told the 
council Monday, "that would spell the death of the library." 
</P>
<P>
 Council members Rosa Chacon, Joanne Baltierrez and Raul Godinez II also agreed 
to hold a public hearing at 7 p.m. Aug. 17 to discuss the hospital dispute 
surrounding Mission Community Hospitals. The hearing will also be held at the 
council chambers. 
</P>
<P>
 The city has objected to the way Mission Community Hospitals was formed 
earlier this year when San Fernando and Panorama Community hospitals were 
merged. 
</P>
<P>
 According to City Atty. Julia Silva, the action seems to violate a 1970s 
agreement with San Fernando Community Hospital, which agreed not to merge with 
another hospital in exchange for the city's support of a bond issue. 
</P>
<P>
 The council also agreed to a special municipal election on Nov. 8, in which 
voters will consider leasing the 4,700-square-foot police station to the city 
attorney for five years at a cost of $6,345 a month. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the Northridge earthquake, the city has allowed the Los Angeles city 
attorney's office to use the old police station at 120 MacNeil St. as a 
temporary headquarters, free ofrent. 
</P>
<P>
 Between now and the election, however, the city attorney will be charged 
$1,300 a month to lease the property. JEFF SCHNAUFER

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: STUDIO CITY; ASBESTOS FIND DELAYS STATION DEMOLITION

<TEXT>
<P>
 Slated to get under way Tuesday, the bulldozing of an earthquake-damaged 
Studio City fire station was postponed temporarily after officials found 
additional asbestos not spotted during earlier inspections. 
</P>
<P>
 "While we were there this morning, looking up in the attic, we saw a couple 
(of) pipes that were wrapped," Los Angeles Fire Department Capt. Louis Roupoli 
said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was only a couple little pieces." 
</P>
<P>
 A private contractor had already removed pipe wrappings and asbestos-coated 
floor tiles from Fire Station 78, near the corner of Coldwater Canyon Avenue 
and Ventura Boulevard, Roupoli said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the contractor planned to return Tuesday to deal with the 
newly-discovered wrappings. 
</P>
<P>
 Preliminary demolition of the cracked building is already under way. The hose 
tower has been felled and electrical and water systems disconnected.  
</P>
<P>
 Roupoli said the bulldozers should get to work today or Thursday, after 
asbestos crews finish their work. 
</P>
<P>
 The demolition is expected to last about a month.  
</P>
<P>
 Officials have said firefighters will move back into temporary trailers at the 
site in the fall while planning for a new, permanent station continues. ERIC

FAMILY AND FRIENDS BURY DENISE HUBER IN SOUTH DAKOTA; CRIME: POLICE UNLOAD 
SUSPECT'S BELONGINGS AND TRY TO DETERMINE IF HE HAD MET THE FORMER NORTHRIDGE 
RESIDENT BEFORE THE KILLING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 As Denise Huber was buried in South Dakota on Tuesday, police unloaded a truck 
packed with accused killer John J. Famalaro's belongings, seized from 
Famalaro's Arizona home, where Huber's body was found in a freezer. 
</P>
<P>
 The discovery of the body ended a three-year mystery that began when Huber, 
who grew up in Northridge, was reported missing on June 3, 1991, after her car 
was found abandoned with a flat tire on the Corona del Mar Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other things, investigators hope to determine whether Famalaro, a 
37-year-old house painter, had ever met Huber, a 23-year-old waitress who 
vanished while returning home to Newport Beach after a concert. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities also are seeking evidence that would confirm that Famalaro, a 
former Orange County resident, was in the area at the time Huber disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're pretty confident that he was in the Orange County area during the 
second and third of June, which is when she disappeared," said Costa Mesa 
Police Lt. Ron Smith. 
</P>
<P>
 "But we're looking for any kind of receipt, phone bill, letter, canceled 
check, anything that would give us a time and a date and a location, and 
anything that would somehow connect him with Denise before the disappearance 
that would explain their encounter," Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Is it just chance that her tire goes flat and he happens to be driving by? Or 
had he been following her?" 
</P>
<P>
 Famalaro is being held without bail in the Yavapai County, Ariz., jail pending 
his extradition to Orange County. Arrested July 13 after Huber's body was 
discovered in a freezer inside a stolen rental truck at his Arizona house, 
Famalaro faces first-degree murder charges. He could be sentenced to death if 
convicted. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County prosecutors filed murder charges against Famalaro last week 
after preliminary DNA testing indicated stains at a Laguna Hills warehouse 
facility rented by Famalaro matched Huber's blood, indicating she may have been 
killed in California before her body was taken to Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
 Famalaro has not yet entered a plea to those charges, but he has pleaded not 
guilty to the Arizona charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other items, the 17-foot truck was filled with hundreds of boxes of 
documents, papers and personal effects. Police also unloaded the suspected 
murder weapon -- a nail puller that was previously described as a crowbar -- 
the freezer in which Huber's body was found, Huber's clothes and other 
belongings, a computer, typewriter, as well as a refrigerator found inside 
Famalaro's house. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities predicted it would take weeks to pore through the cache. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're looking through every shred of paper to see if there's any significance 
to it at all," Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 Huber, meanwhile, was buried in Herreid, S.D., a farming community of 485 
residents where her family, who were active in San Fernando Valley Protestant 
church circles for many years, has deep roots. 
</P>
<P>
 Denise "always enjoyed" visiting Herreid, said her father, Dennis Huber. "We 
really feel like we're home and among friends and family, and that is very, 
very important to me," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 225 friends and relatives crowded into the tiny First Reformed 
Church to take part in a 90-minute service. Some mourners had to sit in the 
church basement, watching the service on a video monitor. Others gathered 
outside under cloudy skies around another monitor set up near a large 
cottonwood tree. 
</P>
<P>
 Dennis Huber and his wife, Ione, are moving later this month from Newport 
Beach to Bismarck, N.D., about 100 miles north of Herreid, a move they had 
planned before their daughter's body was found three weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "I look at it as a new start, and hopefully we can get away from some of the 
bad memories," Dennis Huber said of the move out of Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hubers said they plan to attend Famalaro's trial in Orange County, 
however, hoping that he will be sentenced to death. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think I could ever begin to figure out why (she was killed)," Dennis 
Huber said. "She was a beautiful, wonderful person . . ."

RESENTMENT OVER AWARD LED MAN TO KILL RIVAL, PROSECUTOR SAYS; COURTS: OPENING 
STATEMENTS ARE HEARD IN THE SLAYING OF A CANYON COUNTRY TAE KWON DO INSTRUCTOR. 
DEFENSE SAYS BLOOD FOUND ON THE BODY IS SOMEONE ELSE'S.

 Jealousy motivated Stuart Milburn to use a chokehold to strangle and kill a 
rival martial arts instructor and dump her body along a Santa Clarita road, a 
prosecutor said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 With that violent image, the trial began for Milburn, 27, who is accused of 
killing Veronica Estrada, 29, because she was named instructor of the year at 
Taekwondo USA in Canyon Country, where they both taught. 
</P>
<P>
 "He felt that award should have been given to him," Deputy Dist. Atty. Robert 
Foltz told a Los Angeles Superior Court jury. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorney Darryl Mounger said evidence will show that Milburn was at 
the tae kwon do studio at the time of the killing. A blood smear discovered on 
Estrada's body belonged to neither she nor Milburn, Mounger said. 
</P>
<P>
 Milburn is charged with murder, and with lying in wait and committing murder 
during the crime of sodomy. Foltz said he will not seek the death penalty, 
leaving Milburn to face a maximum sentence of life in prison without the 
possibility of parole if he is convicted. 
</P>
<P>
 Estrada, who was the American Taekwondo Assn.'s top-ranked female competitor 
in the second-level black belt division, was last seen the evening of Dec. 15, 
1993, leaving the studio, where she taught 5- to 8-year-old students. 
</P>
<P>
 Milburn was among a group of three people who searched for her the next day 
and later found her partially clothed body among heavy brush along Soledad 
Canyon Road. 
</P>
<P>
 Friends at first, Estrada and Milburn's relationship was later marked by 
conflict. 
</P>
<P>
 "She and Mr. Milburn had an ongoing animosity," Foltz told jurors as he began 
retracing the events leading to and following the slaying. 
</P>
<P>
 Foltz said Milburn left work around 8 p.m. after telling Ken Lewis, owner of 
the tae kwon do studio, that he felt sick. 
</P>
<P>
 Around the same time, Foltz said, Eddie Hockaday, Estrada's boyfriend with 
whom she shared a Canyon Country apartment, called the studio to see if she 
needed a ride home, but was told she had already left. 
</P>
<P>
 "She never came home that night," Foltz said. 
</P>
<P>
 By the next morning, Hockaday retrieved a message on his answering machine 
from a female jogger who found Estrada's wallet along Soledad. A search ensued, 
ending in the discovery of Estrada's body by Lewis, who was accompanied by 
Milburn and another woman. 
</P>
<P>
 In contention is Milburn's whereabouts at the time of the killing. Coroner's 
officials estimate Estrada died around 8:15 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Foltz alleged that after Milburn left the studio around 8 p.m., he was spotted 
by Lewis at 9 p.m. near the studio. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For the defense, Mounger told jurors that Milburn was at the studio when 
Estrada was killed, and said a studio employee remembers seeing him put a 
Christmas card in her gym bag around 8:20 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Mounger emphasized that prosecutors lack physical evidence, such as semen, to 
link Milburn to the murder or sexual attack which also took place. He also 
referred to a blood smear found on Estrada's front leg. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't belong to the victim," Mounger said. "It doesn't belong to Mr. 
Milburn." 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecutor said that two separate witnesses recall seeing a man and a 
smaller person wearing yellow sweat pants with a black stripe -- what Estrada 
was wearing -- in the same vicinity on Soledad on the night of the killing. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the women told police she saw the larger person put an arm around the 
smaller person's neck and start pulling the individual off the side of the 
road. 
</P>
<P>
 Foltz said that Milburn was known to use a particular style of chokehold on 
students and that he had previously stated he could take someone out in seconds 
using the technique.

COUNTY REJECTS HEARINGS INTO SUNSHINE DUMP; SOLID WASTE: A JUDGE WILL DECIDE 
THURSDAY WHETHER EXPANSION OF THE LANDFILL CAN RESUME AMID LEGAL CHALLENGES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 A move to reconsider the expansion of Sunshine Canyon Landfill north of 
Granada Hills was defeated Tuesday as the political posturing and legal 
maneuvering that has long surrounded the project intensified. 
</P>
<P>
 Responding to complaints from residents who live around the now-idle dump, and 
from Los Angeles city officials, Supervisor Mike Antonovich asked the Board of 
Supervisors to order public hearings into whether dump operator Browning Ferris 
Industries Inc. violated any laws when it began clearing the canyon by felling 
mature oak trees in June. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisors approved the project last November -- allowing the dump to expand 
its capacity to 17 million tons in a sensitive oak woodland just outside the 
Los Angeles city limits. 
</P>
<P>
 Antonovich's motion failed when his fellow supervisors refused to second the 
idea. 
</P>
<P>
 Although they testified in support of the motion, dump opponents said they 
were just as pleased it did not pass. 
</P>
<P>
 "This means we can go straight into court," said Rosemary Woodlock, an 
attorney representing the North Valley Coalition of Concerned Citizens. "This 
was not a loss for us at all." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the war over Sunshine Canyon is being fought on so many fronts that 
the effects of individual actions often are difficult to gauge. This week 
alone, for instance, the project faces three potentially critical points. 
</P>
<P>
 Antonovich's motion was the first -- and both sides characterized the outcome 
as a victory. Today, the Los Angeles City Council is scheduled to discuss 
settling its lawsuit against the county and Browning Ferris. And Thursday, a 
Los Angeles County Superior Court judge will decide whether to make permanent a 
temporary order barring Browning Ferris from any further work on the dump until 
legal challenges are resolved. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the negotiations between Browning Ferris and the city are secret, 
documents obtained by The Times show that last week Browning Ferris offered to 
reimburse the city $500,000 in legal fees and donate $1 million toward 
community improvements if the city drops its lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 Browning Ferris also wants the city to end restrictions on a road leading 
through a portion of the dump that was closed by the city in 1991. City 
officials say Browning Ferris needs their permission to use the road. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In return, the settlement would allow the city to dump trash at the site when 
it opens. Angry at the city for refusing expansion in its jurisdiction, county 
officials retaliated by limiting the amount of city trash the landfill could 
accept. 
</P>
<P>
 But sources said Browning Ferris this week has balked at city counteroffers, 
which reportedly ask for as much as $700,000 more in legal fees and community 
improvements. 
</P>
<P>
 One City Council source suggested that the negotiations appeared to be hitting 
an impasse. Deputy City Atty. Keith Pritsker declined to comment on the 
negotiations as did Browing Ferris spokesman Arnie Berghoff. 
</P>
<P>
 Unless the city settles today, Pritsker and Woodlock will face off against 
Browning Ferris attorneys Thursday to argue whether preparation work should 
continue at the dump site while legal challenges are pending. 
</P>
<P>
 In June, a judge issued a temporary restraining order against Browning Ferris 
after crews cut down about 1,800 oak trees in the days after a county committee 
allowed preparation work to commence. Opponents claim Browning Ferris did not 
have proper clearance from state authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if the city drops out of the lawsuit, Woodlock said, the North Valley 
Coalition will continue to fight the landfill. But, she said, the group will 
ask the city to reimburse it about $400,000 in legal fees -- money she said the 
city saved by piggybacking on the coalition's lawsuits.

VALLEY BRIEFING: MEASURING A METROPOLIS; IF THE VALLEY WERE A CITY, HOW WOULD 
IT COMPARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Will the day ever come when mail is postmarked "San Fernando Valley, CA"? Many 
Valley residents already feel separate from Los Angeles. And many non-Valley 
urbanites view the Valley the same way. Actual secession has even been 
discussed in the past. 
</P>
<P>
 In terms of size and services, the Valley could certainly hold its own against 
other large cities. If it were a city, the Valley's population size would rank 
sixth in the country. It would cover about the same square-mile area as 
Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 The Valley's crime rate would be fairly low, compared to other cities of 
similar size. And although it may not seem like it, the majority of residents 
are from California. About 62% were born in the state. Conversely, 68% of 
Americans reside in the state they were born in. But a greater percentage of 
Valley residents are under 18 here-38% compared to the U.S. average of 25.5%

10 INJURED AFTER TRUCK OVERTURNS ON FREEWAY

 A roofing truck overturned on the Simi Valley Freeway on Tuesday morning, 
injuring all 10 occupants -- including seven men riding in the back -- and 
snarling rush-hour traffic, CHP officers said. 
</P>
<P>
 The victims were taken to San Fernando Valley hospitals with injuries ranging 
from moderate to serious. 
</P>
<P>
 The accident occurred shortly after 7 a.m. as the truck traveled westbound on 
the Simi Valley Freeway near Tampa Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 The driver of the two-axle truck was believed to be traveling too fast for the 
flow of traffic and "apparently he didn't know it until it was too late," CHP 
Officer Doug Reynolds said. 
</P>
<P>
 As the truck approached slower traffic, the driver "applied his brakes and 
lost control of his truck." 
</P>
<P>
 The truck went into a side skid, then rolled over on its side and slid about 
35 to 40 feet, Reynolds said. 
</P>
<P>
 Several of the men who were riding in the back of the truck with roofing 
material and equipment were ejected, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Two men in the cab and the driver of the truck were also injured. 
</P>
<P>
 No other vehicles were involved. 
</P>
<P>
 A 17-year-old man suffered head injuries and was listed in serious condition 
at Northridge Hospital Medical Center. A 44-year-old man was listed in serious 
condition with head, chest and spinal injuries, a hospital spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 A man in his 50s who was taken to Granada Hills Community Hospital with 
clavicle fractures was listed in stable condition. A man in his late 20s 
suffered minor neck discomfort, and was treated and released from Granada Hills 
Community Hospital, said Sarah L. Steinman, hospital spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
 Their names were not released. 
</P>
<P>
 Mario Reyes, 23, of La Habra had multiple minor injuries and was treated and 
released from Holy Cross Medical Center. Helberto Mesqueda of La Habra suffered 
multiple internal injuries, said Jane Cessar, spokeswoman for Holy Cross 
Medical Center.  
</P>
<P>
 Augustine Salazar, 17, and Antonio Esquivel, 36, were treated and released 
from West Valley Hospital and Health Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Two victims were treated at the scene and refused transportation, said Jim 
Wells of the Los Angeles Fire Department. The accident forced the closure of 
the right lane of the freeway for two hours and a SigAlert was issued, Reynolds 
said.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; ASSESSOR WILL TRIM AT LEAST 22 FROM SANTA 
CLARITA STAFF 
</P>

<P>
 The local county assessor's office, which now has about 25 employees, will be 
closed and moved to a new location that will be staffed by three or fewer 
employees, officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The closure of the office, which opened five years ago, is necessitated by 
county budget cuts, said Gary Townsend, chief deputy for the Los Angeles County 
Office of the Assessor, who also said that some of the county's 11 other 
offices are also likely to be closed. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Clarita's office will be the first to close, Townsend said, because its 
lease expires first, in April, 1995. Employees no longer needed at the 
downsized office will be sent to other regional offices, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The office, in a real estate plaza on The Old Road, is scheduled to close 
early next year, Townsend said. A new location has not been determined. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will not close the existing office without opening another one," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Townsend said he believes the smaller, replacement office will be able to 
handle at least 90% of the more than 100 calls and visits received daily. He 
predicted most homeowners won't notice the difference, because 90% of 
reassessment applications are processed by mail. He admitted the processing of 
some items will be slower. 
</P>
<P>
 Some who deal with the Santa Clarita office on a regular basis said they doubt 
the smaller office will be able to keep up with ordinary traffic, especially 
because the lingering recession and Northridge earthquake have sent real estate 
prices into disarray. 
</P>
<P>
 "We expect that there will be an increase in real estate activity in the 
valley, and we have a concern that as building picks up, the reduced staff may 
not be able to keep up with the service level they have now," said Carol 
Maglione, a spokeswoman for The Newhall Land & Farming Co., a major developer 
in the Santa Clarita Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Clarita City Councilwoman Jo Anne Darcy said the new office will cause 
headaches for large projects that require official, detailed maps of an area 
and property ownership lists. 
</P>
<P>
 Darcy, who is also a field deputy to county Supervisor Michael Antonovich, 
said the cuts were not itemized in the budget approved by the supervisors, so 
she and other local officials didn't learn of the plan to downsize the office 
until late last week. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess we all have to take the budget crunch and squeeze, but I didn't know 
it included this," she said.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; SUSPECT IN OFFICER'S ASSAULT HAD LONG HISTORY 
OF CRIME 
</P>

<P>
 Ronald Arnett Coleman, the Palmdale resident arrested Monday for allegedly 
assaulting a California Highway Patrol officer, has spent most of his adult 
life in trouble with the law, according to state parole records. 
</P>
<P>
 Coleman, 33, was first arrested on a drug possession charge as a juvenile in 
1977 and has been apprehended 15 to 20 times since, although some of the cases 
were never prosecuted, according to officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he had been arrested previously for possession of firearms, his 
record did not involve violence. 
</P>
<P>
 "He does not appear to be an exceptionally violent person," said Hugh Nelson, 
assistant regional administrator for the state parole office. "The majority of 
instances are substance abuse and property theft." 
</P>
<P>
 Charges are likely to be filed today against Coleman for his alleged beating 
of CHP Officer Amy Bonilla, 28, who pulled his car over for speeding Monday 
morning on the Antelope Valley Freeway, said Deputy Dist. Atty. Dan Damon. 
</P>
<P>
 Coleman allegedly lunged at Bonilla when she attempted to administer a field 
sobriety test. 
</P>
<P>
 A limousine driver and two off-duty Burbank Police Department officers stopped 
to restrain Coleman, who repeatedly punched Bonilla in the face, according to 
law enforcement officials. Bonilla was treated for facial cuts and bruises and 
released from Henry Mayo Newhall Memorial Hospital in Valencia. 
</P>
<P>
 Coleman's adult criminal history includes a two-year sentence in 1984 for 
receiving stolen property, a 16-month sentence in 1990 for possessing a firearm 
and a two-year sentence in 1991 for possession of cocaine, Nelson said. Coleman 
served about half of his prison term in each case. 
</P>
<P>
 He was also arrested May 1, 1993, on suspicion of driving under the influence 
of alcohol. As a result, he served about eight months in state prison for 
violating his parole and two months in county jail on the driving under 
influence charge, Nelson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Coleman is in custody in lieu of $500,000 bail. Damon said it's possible that 
an attempted murder charge will be filed against him, which would carry a 
maximum sentence of nine years in state prison. Coleman could receive 
additional time because he was carrying a loaded weapon in the car, officials 
said.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; SECOND INTERIM WARDEN NAMED FOR LANCASTER 
STATE PRISON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHIL SNEIDERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A second interim warden has been named to oversee the new state prison in 
Lancaster while corrections officials wait for Gov. Pete Wilson to make a 
permanent appointment. 
</P>
<P>
 Donald R. Hill, 51, warden of the California Correctional Institution at 
Tehachapi, moved to the Lancaster prison on Monday, prison spokeswoman Lynn 
Harrison said.He will also continue to serve as warden at the Tehachapi prison, 
although an assistant will oversee day-to-day operations at that facility. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill succeeds John Ratelle, who was appointed interim warden in late February. 
While at Lancaster, Ratelle also was serving as warden for a state prison in 
San Diego, commuting back to that city each weekend to be with his family. 
</P>
<P>
 Ratelle originally was told he would be at Lancaster only for one to three 
months, and after five months of commuting he asked to be relieved, Harrison 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lancaster detention center, officially called California State Prison -- 
Los Angeles County, opened in February, 1993, under Warden Otis Thurman. 
</P>
<P>
 During the prison's first year, two minimum-security and two maximum-security 
inmates escaped. Although all of the prisoners were recaptured, the escapes are 
believed to have been a key reason that state officials removed Thurman from 
his post this past February. 
</P>
<P>
 During Ratelle's tenure, he tightened security at the prison and disciplined 
correctional officers who were on duty during one of the maximum-security 
escapes. No escapes occurred during Ratelle's watch. 
</P>
<P>
 The new interim warden, Hill, wants to maintain a low profile, Harrison said, 
because the governor is said to be close to appointing another permanent 
administrator for the Lancaster prison, which houses more than 3,000 inmates. 
</P>
<P>
 When that appointment is made, Hill will return to the Tehachapi prison, she 
said.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; EXOTIC DANCE CLUB DELAYS REOPENING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A controversial exotic dance club just outside Santa Clarita has postponed its 
reopening for at least two weeks for unspecified reasons, and now tentatively 
plans to open its doors Aug. 15. 
</P>
<P>
 Castaic Junction: A Gentleman's Club, located just north of Six Flags Magic 
Mountain, was closed by police July 21 because the club did not have the proper 
county permits.Club officials said they hoped to reopen Monday, but failed to 
do so. 
</P>
<P>
 An answering machine at Castaic Junction's listed phone number states the club 
will tentatively stage its "grand opening" Aug. 15 as a restaurant with a full 
bar and live exotic dancing. 
</P>
<P>
 Castaic Junction has stirred controversy since opening in late June. The 
building's owner obtained a court order forcing all-nude female dancers to wear 
bikinis, claiming the dancers violated the club's lease. 
</P>
<P>
 Numerous protests have also come from local residents, but club officials said 
their crowds were good until the shutdown.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; QUARREL ENDS IN STABBING DEATH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 29-year-old woman stabbed and killed a younger, distant relative Monday in a 
dispute about a how much money she owed him for baby-sitting, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Toriano Jackson, 24, of Lancaster went to the Lancaster home of Sherrel 
Crayton to collect what he claimed was a $25 debt, said Lt. Derry Benedict of 
the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
 The two quarreled in the street, Benedict said, and Crayton allegedly stabbed 
Jackson in the chest with a steak knife. Jackson was pronounced dead at 11:16 
p.m. at Lancaster Community Hospital, Benedict said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's deputies said they were not sure how the two were related, but said 
the two had family members in common. 
</P>
<P>
 Crayton is being held on charges of first-degree murder, said Sgt. Gary 
Miller.

RELATIONSHIPS: BUILDING CONFIDENCE IN THEIR OWN WORDS; THE WINNERS' CIRCLE 
TOASTMASTERS CLUB IN ORANGE GIVES PAROLEES, THE MENTALLY IMPAIRED AND THE 
HOMELESS A CHANCE TO SPEAK THEIR MINDS .  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN MORELL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mention Toastmasters International and one usually envisions a group of 
business people giving speeches over lunch, preparing their deliveries for 
sales pitches and conventions. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Winners' Circle Toastmasters Club is a little different. Instead of 
meeting at a restaurant or a plush conference room, Winners' Circle members 
gather weekly in a large, converted garage that doubles as a rec room, sitting 
in folding chairs and on donated couches. 
</P>
<P>
 The club is made up of about 20 male and female parolees, as well as the 
mentally impaired and what psychologist William J. Woolbright, the club's 
co-director, refers to as "urban nomads" -- the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
 Chartered in June, Winners' Circle is based at Cactus Gardens, a residential 
employment development home in Orange for male parolees who are preparing to 
re-enter society. There is no fee charged to the members. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the members lack the social skills needed to get along with others and 
make a good impression -- especially for job interviews. The members of 
Winner's Circle are learning to speak their minds with clarity and courtesy. 
Mistakes are easily forgiven here; the emphasis is not on what you say or how 
you say it; you're applauded by the club just for showing up. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to find options for these people that they wouldn't ordinarily have," 
says Woolbright, who, with his wife, Florence, also serves as director of two 
residential employment development homes for women in Orange County. "They're 
disenfranchised; they're seeking achievement and recognition. Learning basic 
public speaking skills builds confidence. It's an ego boost that helps them 
when they're on their own." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the membership is unique and the setting may not be typical for a 
Toastmasters' meeting, the format is. The Toastmaster, appointed at the 
previous meeting, conducts the morning's discussions, introduces speakers and 
comes up with the "Table Topics." In this part of the meeting, the Toastmaster 
asks each attendee a question, such as "What is the greatest discovery known to 
man?" or "Should the U.S. police other nations?" 
</P>
<P>
 The person being asked must stand and deliver a spontaneous one- to two-minute 
reply. Afterward, speeches are made by members who have been given a week to 
prepare, and then the Table Topic responses are judged along with the 
discourse.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's all done in a very positive manner," Woolbright says. "The emphasis is 
always on providing reinforcement that lets the speakers know their strengths." 
</P>
<P>
 James E. Ray, 43, recently served as the weekly Toastmaster. "I've always been 
a debater, a rebel. I love controversy," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Ray arrived at Cactus Gardens in April 1993 after serving 1 1/2 years on a 
marijuana possession conviction. His last four months were spent in the 
hospital, recovering from surgery and a lung infection. 
</P>
<P>
 He says his acceptance at Cactus Gardens turned his life around. "I came here 
with nothing, and now I'm headed in the right direction." 
</P>
<P>
 Ray found Speechcraft -- a program developed by Toastmasters International 
that works on building listening, thinking and speaking skills -- a good outlet 
for his energy. "It's helped me focus, and it's improved my ability to 
communicate with others. I have more confidence. If I'm debating a topic with 
someone, and I know I'm wrong, I still debate. You have to prove to me that I'm 
wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 Dan, a mildly retarded 25-year-old man who asked that his last name not be 
used, prides himself on the certificates he received for a pair of three- to 
five-minute prepared speeches he gave on motorcycles and the moon. "I was 
nervous at first before my first speech," he says. "But it got easier after I 
started talking." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The club got its start at Cactus Gardens two years ago, when Woolbright helped 
start the Speechcraft program. "This complements those who are in recovery 
programs for drugs and alcohol, and those in therapy, and helps them find 
positive, worthwhile educational activities," Woolbright says. 
</P>
<P>
 "In our society, we tend to be adept at telling people what not to do -- don't 
use drugs, don't use alcohol -- but here is something we can tell people to do, 
a clean and sober activity that has positive community values." 
</P>
<P>
 After bringing the Speechcraft program to Cactus Gardens, Woolbright became 
interested in Toastmasters and last year joined a club based at the Crystal 
Cathedral in Garden Grove. He also began to see that while the members of 
Speechcraft were improving their social skills, some wanted more. "We had a 
number of people who developed the skills to go on, and for them, they needed 
the format of a Toastmasters club. That would give our members access to clubs 
around the world, where they could continue to grow and get positive 
reinforcement," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Building confidence takes precedence over polishing speaking skills at 
Winners' Circle. "Many of our members have never received a certificate or a 
blue ribbon for excellence" before this, Woolbright says. "Toastmasters has 
given us a ready-made program in ego building and communication skills." 
</P>
<P>
 Giving a speech before an audience isn't easy for anyone, but the Toastmaster 
program is formatted to take each member through a gradual series of steps. 
"Each step builds into the next one, from standing up and answering a question, 
to giving longer speeches," Woolbright says. "The emphasis is on handling 
yourself in a group of people and making eye contact. It's a nurturing 
situation for everyone; the commendations are very generous. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's fascinating to see the physical change in some of the members after 
they've been involved for a while. They have a complete change of body 
language, of understanding how their behavior impacts others," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the group supports everyone who tries to improve their speaking 
skills, success is ultimately dependent on the individuals themselves.  
</P>
<P>
 "Of course, you ultimately get out what you put into a program like that," 
says Jackie Singer, an Irvine psychologist who has worked with various groups 
in therapy situations. "But when people get a chance to interact with others, 
improve themselves and carry those skills into the real world, it's a positive 
experience." 
</P>
<P>
 Woolbright says he has seen many changes in the mentally impaired members of 
the group. "They're accepted as they are, and they get plenty of encouragement, 
which leads to their growth and success. In our society, when we know someone 
is a diabetic and is able to control their disease with insulin, we accept 
them. But when someone has a mental illness, even if it's under control, the 
stigma remains. That's why they need access to normal responses and 
encouragement to others," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 With the success of Toastmasters at Cactus Gardens, Woolbright is hopeful that 
it can be transferred to other groups. "I think it would do wonders with 
troubled teens, giving them the affirmation they look for in gangs and drugs. 
Anyone could benefit from a program like this. We can all use some help 
communicating with others."

 Clarification -- A story about writer Gary Paulsen in Sunday's Life & Style 
contained several editing errors.Paulsen's novel "Dogsong" was published in 
1985 and he ran his second Iditarod race in 1985. "Winterdance" was published 
by Harcourt Brace and "Father Water, Mother Woods" by Delacorte. Also, the 
story may have given the impression that Paulsen's wife accompanied him in the 
Iditarod races; she did not.

TV RATINGS; VIEWERS CAST A VOTE FOR THE LAUGHS

 CBS' "60 Minutes" and ABC's "20/20" cracked the Top 10, but otherwise it was 
comedy that dominated America's television viewing last week, according to 
ratings released Tuesday by the A. C. Nielsen Co. ABC's "Home Improvement" 
(starring Tim Allen) and "Grace Under Fire" were on top, followed by NBC's 
"Seinfeld" and "Frasier." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet CBS edged out its rivals in the network race, thanks to strong showings on 
Saturday, Sunday and Monday, where "The Nanny," running outside its usual time 
slot, tied at No. 17--its first finish in the Top 20. In its regular airing on 
Wednesday, it ranked 33rd. 
</P>
<P>
 Fox's effort to transfer the daytime children's hit "The Mighty Morphin Power 
Rangers" to prime time met with an unenthusiastic response from most viewers. 
The Friday night telecast ranked 80th among the week's 86 prime-time network 
programs--although Fox said it attracted 36% of the available children.
